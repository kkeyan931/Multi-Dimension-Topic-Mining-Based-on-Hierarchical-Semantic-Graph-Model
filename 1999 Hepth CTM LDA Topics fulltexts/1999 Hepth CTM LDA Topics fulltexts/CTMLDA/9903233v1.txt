abstract

the large n matrix model is studied with attention to the quantum uctuations

around a given diagonal background. feynman rules are explicitly derived and their

relation to those in usual yang-mills theory is discussed. background d-instanton

conguration is naturally identied as a discretization of momentum space of a cor-

responding qft. the structure of large n divergence is also studied on the analogy

of uv divergences in qft.

introduction

matrix model provides a new paradigm for thinking about fundamental theories of physics. it

originates in the observation [1] that the massless modes propagating along the world volume

of n coincident d-branes are those of the supersymmetric yang-mills theory, obtained by the

dimensional reductions of the d = 10 n = 1 theory down to p + 1 spacetime dimensions.

according to so-called matrix conjecture [2], 0 + 1-dimensional reduction can be regarded

as the discrete light cone quantization of m-theory in which the spacetime is compactied on

an almost light like circle. this proposes a concrete, a nonperturbative denition of quantum

gravity, and quite remarkably, the conjecture has found quite nontrivial support [3, 4, 5, 6].

meanwhile, type iib matrix model proposed by [7] plays somewhat complementary role. its

action is 0 + 0-dimensional reduction of large n super yang-mills theory in ten dimensions. the

authors of [8] proposed a very interesting program to study dynamical formation of space-time

using the type iib matrix model.

despite much remarkable success of matrix model approach, the question why and how

such a simple model could describe our real world? is still elusive. the main diculty consists

in the absence of built-in rules concerning how to take large n limit. for example, in the

case of matrix model approach to 2d gravity [9], there is a critical point gc, and continuum limit

is possible keeping certain relation between n and g  gc (double scaling limit). for type iib

matrix model, however, the coupling constant g can be absorbed into the rescaling of the elds

(at least classically) and there is no nontrivial xed point.

the result of matrix integration is just a number as it stands. to extract physical intuition,

we need to separate eld variables into two types: the classical background and the quantum

uctuation.

in the spirit of born-oppenheimer approximation, the eective dynamics of the slow vari-

ables (classical background) are of primary concern which is obtained only after fast variables

(quantum uctuations) are integrated out. this is the approach taken by many works.

in matrix models, however, somewhat dierent approach might be of considerable interest.

recall that in the usual analysis of quantum eld theory, gravitational eects are almost always

ignored, although gravitons are massless and never decouple. gravitational degree of freedom

are not integrated over, but regarded as xed, classical background. this treatment is justied

1

simply because the dimensionful coupling is so small in the energy scale accessible by the current

technology. similarly for the observers living on the branes, natural time scale is set by that

of quantum uctuations rather than the dynamical time scale of the background = spacetime.

put it dierently, motion of the background is too slow to be treated quantum mechanically.

in this paper, we will study the quantum dynamics of the matrix model from the latter point

of view, hoping our work provide some insight about how to take large n limit. the paper is

organized as follows.

in section two, starting from 0 + 0-dimensional matrix action, we derive fatgraph feynman

rules for the quantum uctuations treating general multi d-instanton conguration as a xed

background. the usage of the feynman rules is shown with an example. although we will work

in d-instanton backgrounds of iib matrix model, we expect our analysis shed some light on

general d-p branes in other matrix theories as well, since type iib matrix model compactied

on s1 is equivalent to the 1 + 0-dimensional matrix model [10].

the matrix feynman rules are very close to those in the usual d-dimensional sym. in

section three, we will study a special backgrounds where d-instantons are concentrated along

d-dimensional sheet in the original d-dimensional spacetime. we will see nite n theories can

be thought of as uv regulated versions of at space yang-mills theory in which removing the

cuto is equivalent to letting n go to innity. the crucial observation of this paper is that

from yang-mills perturbation point of view, going to matrix model can be thought of as a

discretization of a momentum space rather than a coordinate space. this is shown explicitly by

comparing feynman rules. this is yet another manifestation of spacetime uncertainty [11] or

uv/ir correspondence [12].

for the d-dimensional quantum eld theory embedded in the matrix model, the only source

of divergence is the large n limit.

in section four, we will study the structure of large n

divergences in matrix theory and relate it to the renormalizability of qft in the usual sense

of the term. we hope this line of argument give us a hint to deduce realistic physics from the

matrix models. finally, we conclude with a discussion of our results and some implications.

2 matrix perturbation theory around d-instanton background

in this section, we elaborate the perturbation theory of the matrix model around d-instanton

background. explicit forms of feynman rules are derived and boson self energy diagrams are

computed at one loop as an example.

2.1 the type iib matrix model and its gauge xing

our starting point is the euclidean type iib matrix model, whose action is given by

s = 

1

g2 tr(cid:18) 1

4

[x, x ]2 +

1
2

[x, ](cid:19)

(2.1)

where x and  are d-dimensional vector and majorana-weyl spinor respectively, taking values

in n  n hermitian matrices.1 throughout this paper, tr denotes the trace taken over n  n

matrix indices.

the action enjoys the following symmetries

 rotation invariance

x  =  x ,

 =

i
2

 ,

( = )

 translation invariance

 n = 2 susy

(2.4)

1we choose d = 10 type iib matrix model just for deniteness. we could start from any model reduced from

d-dimensional sym.

as stated in introduction, we decompose x  as a sum of classical background part x  and
x  will be treated as xed, classical number and we will be

quantum uctuation part x .

interested in the quantum eld theory in this background. ( is assumed to have no classical

vacuum expectation value.)

the background x  must be a solution to the equation of motion, [x , [x  , x ]] = 0. we
will consider the cases where all the x s are simultaneously diagonalizable by the gauge action

(2.3):

x  = x  + x ,

x  

x

x
2

. . .

.





x
n

(2.5)

the combination of d eigenvalues xi  (x1

i )  rd is interpreted as the location of the i-
th d-instanton. for a generic background where all d-instantons are separated from each other,

i ,    xd

all the symmetries listed above are explicitly broken. in particular, u (n ) gauge symmetry is

broken down to u (1)n and half of the n = 2 susy (generated by (1)) survives indicating the

bps nature of the background (2.5).

let us make a brief comment on the charges of the elds. all the quantum elds x 

ij, ij, cij,

bij have a charge

i


j


( 0    0 1 0    0 1 0    0 )

(2.6)

with respect to the unbroken u (1)n gauge symmetry. these uctuations correspond to the open
string stretching between d-instantons i and j. in particular, diagonal components x 

ii, ii, cii

and bii are neutral. in fact, as we will soon see, their kinetic terms vanishe indicating they should

be treated as collective coordinates rather than quantum variables, and thus need a separate

treatment. since these diagonal components could be absorbed into the shift of the background

d-instanton conguration, incorporating these uctuations would inevitably lead to the integral

over the collective coordinates, which is beyond the scope of this paper.

we will study the quantum theory of uctuations as parameterized by the classical back-

ground i.e. d-instanton positions {xi}n

i=1. plugging (2.5) into the action (2.1) and using the

4

relation [ x , x  ]ik = (x

i  x

k ) x 

ik, we have

s =

{(xij)2 x

(2.8)

(2.9)

the gauge xing term (2.8) implies we have chosen a gauge such that the uctuation xij is
transverse to the relative vector xij, i.e. p x

ij = 0.

x 

ij

the gauge xed total action is given by

stotal = s + sg.f. + sf.p.

(2.10)

note that sg.f. in (2.10) cancels with the second term of (2.7). the perturbation is valid when
d-instanton separation xij is much larger than g1/2.

2.2 feynman rules

now we will derive feynman rules from the gauge xed action (2.10). hereafter we will rescale
the quantum uctuations x 

ij , etc, in order that the coupling g is removed from the

ij  g x 

propagators and moved to the interaction vertices.

the perturbative structure of large n gauge theories are naturally described in terms of

double line representation [13] of feynman diagrams, so called fatgraphs. one considers, as in

figure 1: propagators

figs. 1 and 2, a graph with the lines thickened slightly into bands which meet smoothly at the

vertices so as to form an oriented riemann surface with boundary. in this representation, the

elds in the adjoint representation of u (n ) are denoted by double lines.

each edge carries a label i, j, . . .  {1, . . . , n } corresponding to the basis of fundamental

representation of u (n ) (or its conjugate depending on its orientation). here it is nothing but

the label of a d-instanton. from the quadratic part of the total action (2.10), we can easily read

o the fatgraph propagators as depicted in fig. 1. note that the denominator is the squared

distance between the two d-instantons connected by the elds.

as for vertices, there is a crucial dierence between ordinary (particle theory) vertex factor

and fatgraph counterpart.

in the former, interaction vertex of order k is invariant under all

possible k! permutations of lines, while in the latter, it is invariant only under k cyclic permuta-

tions. thus, for example, two yukawa coupling diagrams in fig. 2 should be distinguished from

each other.

in deriving the vertex factors, terms must be organized so that the index contraction should

have manifest cyclic invariance. for instance, in order to deduce three-point and four-point
vertex for xs, we must rewrite corresponding terms in (2.7) as follows

overall factors 1/3 and 1/4 are cancelled by the cyclic symmetry of the vertices.

similar computation leads to the vertex factors listed in fig. 2.

2.3 example: one loop boson self energy

in order to illustrate how matrix perturbation theory works, let us calculate the one loop contri-
bution to two point function2 hx 

jii using the feynman rules just derived. relevant fatgraphs

ijx 

are shown in fig. 3. in addition to the external d-instantons i and j, we need to incorporate

an internal d-instanton k as in fig. 4.

let us begin with the diagram (a). it can be seen as representing the history of an open

string; the string ij splits into two pieces ik and kj, and reconnect in the end. applying the

feynman rules, this diagram contributes

here we denote by  and  the so(d) vector indices associated to the upper and lower internal

propagators respectively. similarly, from the diagrams (b) and (c), we have

3 correspondence to quantum eld theories

from the sample calculation given in section 2.3, we notice a strong similarity between the

matrix perturbation theory and a usual d-dimensional qft. roughly speaking, relative brane

position xij corresponds to a momentum p whereas the sum over branes pk looks like a loop
integral r ddp.

in this section, we will make this analogy more precise. in particular, we illustrate how d-

dimensional gauge theories can be recovered from matrix model, when d-instanton conguration

has d-dimensional at directions. in this context, the at directions should be thought of as

momentum coordinates rather than spatial coordinates, contrary to naive expectations. this

can be considered as an example of ir/uv correspondence [12].

innite sums or integrals will pose a delicate problem of large n divergences. we will

postpone discussing this issues to section 4.

3.1 d-instanton distribution as discretized momentum space

we begin with recalling a general structure of d-dimensional gauge theory amplitudes. let a(x)

be u (n) gauge elds represented as n  n matrices and a(p) their fourier transform. hereafter

the symbol tr will denote the trace over n  n matrix indices. any gauge invariant correlation

function can be decomposed as a sum of basic correlation functions of the form

h tr a1(p1)a2(p2)    ak(pk) i,

(p1 +    + pk = 0)

which is invariant under the cyclic permutation of momenta and lorenz indices:

p1  p2      pk  p1,

1  2      k  1.

(3.1)

(3.2)

in the amplitude (3.1), the cyclic order of {(pi, i)}k

i=1 has a denite meaning because u (n)

indices are implicitly contracted.

it is easy to check that there is one-to-one correspondence

among the following three data:

(c) closed oriented path in rd with edge labeling 1,    , k (fig. 5 (a)).

we now come back to matrix model correlation functions. in generic background (2.5) we

still have unbroken u (1)n gauge symmetry. therefore, only gauge invariant wilson loops

such as

h x 1
i1i2

x 2
i2i3

   x k
iki1

i

(3.3)

can be nonzero. actually, we can draw a corresponding loop as in fig. 5 (b): two d-instantons
located at xir and xir+1 are connected by a eld (or an open string) x r

. the amplitude

irir+1

(3.3) is invariant under the cyclic permutation of d-instanton positions and lorenz indices:

i1  i2      ik  i1,

1  2      k  1.

(3.4)

the correspondence between the two gures fig. 5 (a) and (b) is now obvious; the momentum

pr in gauge theory is identied with the d-instanton separation xir+1  xir . in this way, we can

add two new entries to the previous list of one-to-one correspondence:

(d) d-instanton correlation functions (3.3),

11

(e) loop passing through k d-instantons in rd with labeled edges 1, . . . , k

(fig. 5 (b)).

clearly, arbitrary sequence of d-dimensional momenta (p1, . . . , pk) can be realized as a loop in d-

instanton conguration space, provided d-instantons are densely distributed over d-dimensional

euclidean space rd. conversely, if we start from nite n matrix theory, only discrete momentum

points are available on gauge theory side. of course, the error becomes smaller as the number

of d-instantons is increased. guided by these observation, we propose to identify a d-instanton

distribution of matrix theory as a discretization of momentum space seen by a yang-mills theory.

precisely speaking, the momentum path (fig. 5 (a)) can determine the d-instanton path

(fig. 5 (b)) only up to overall translation, xi  xi + c. this ambiguity can be resolved by xing,

say, their center of mass at the origin.

so far we neglected the problem how non-abelian u (n) gauge symmetry can be recovered

from d-instanton picture. this will be discussed in section 3.4.

in sum, we have argued that when the background d-instantons are continuously distributed

along rd, there is a one-to-one correspondence between the gauge theory amplitude (3.1) and

(3.3).

3.2 correspondence of feynman diagrams

in perturbation theory, both amplitudes (3.1) and (3.3) are expressed as a sum over fatgraphs

with xed external lines. we now want to show that two computations, one as a yang-mills

theory and the other as a matrix theory, actually coincide for every fatgraph. to do this, we

need to check the correspondence at the level of propagators and vertices.

consider a fatgraph  made of several propagators and vertices. recall that the graph form

an oriented riemann surface with boundaries. thus for a given propagator with an orientation,

it is meaningful to talk about its left- and right- edges.

pick up a propagator and let i and j be its labels on left- and right-edges, repectively. in

matrix picture, the propgator represents a uctuation x 

ij connecting two d-instantons i and j.

as in section 3.1, we identify the relative separation of d-instantons

xij = xi  xj

(3.5)

with the momentum carried by the propagator in a corresponding qft.

this identication would be incocnsistent if there was an interaction vertex which breaks

their conservation law. in fact, any interaction vertex shown in fig. 2 has following properties:

(i) edges of the propagators are glued together in a denite cyclic order around the vertex so

that successive edges share a common d-instanton label, (ii) all incoming momenta are given as

the dierences of xis associated to successive boundaries. these two facts guarantee the sum

of the incoming momenta is automatically zero.3 for example, consider an interaction vertex

among three d-instantons depicted in fig. 6 (a). since the incoming momenta are dened as

fig. 6 (b), their sum xij + xjk + xki vanishes. it is now straightforward to check that feynman

rules given in figs. 1 and 2 exactly coincide with those of a usual yang-mills theory.

3.3 from sums to integrals

in an ordinary perturbation method, we need to integrate over interaction positions in d-

dimensional spacetime, which results in loop integrals. in the matrix perturbation theory, we

need to sum over intermediate d-instanton positions. the correspondence between these two

implies the equivalence of perturbation theory, because we have just seen that each fatgraph has

the same factors both in matrix and qft pictures.

as discussed in section 3.1, d-instanton conguration along at rd can reproduce d-dimensional

momentum space. more concretely, let us assume d-instantons ll uniformly a d-dimensional

hyperplane

h := n(x1, . . . , xd, 0, . . . , 0)  rdo  rd

(3.6)

3the momentum conservation is a direct consequence of u (1)n gauge invariance. it is, however, nontrivial

whether one can represent the momenta as dierences successively.

13

with density  (i.e. there are  d-instantons per unit d-dimensional volume). then, we can

replace the sum over brane positions pk by the loop integral r ddp.

for example, in the case of the two point function hx 

ijx 

jii of section 2.3, we can choose the

point xi as the origin of the momentum space. then the translation dictionary reads

matrix

which look more familiar as those in standard qft textbooks.

3.4 non-abelian gauge symmetry in matrix model

now we come back to the problem how we can incorporate the non-abelian gauge symmetry

of d-dimensional sym theory starting from matrix models. actually, without this non-abelian

structure, we cannot explain why the cyclic order of momenta is important in the amplitudes

(3.1).

to achieve this, we need to consider the coincident d-branes as in [1]. suppose we want

to realize u (n) gauge symmetry. we need to put n d-instantons at the same point in rd.

14

hereafter the word cluster will be used to designate the n coincident d-instantons. the n

d-instantons are thus grouped into m  n/n clusters.

we choose a background in which cluster r is located at xr = (x1

3.5 d-dimensional super yang-mills action from matrix model

so far, we have studied how a gauge theory is embedded into matrix theory, through the corre-

spondence of correlation functions.

to complete our analysis and to extract further intuition, it will be useful to rewrite the

original matrix model action into that of qft: d-dimensional reduction of sym in d dimensions.

5we neglected the factor (pr 1). this reects the fact that overall shift of d-instanton conguration results

in the same momentum conguration in sym picture. to make the mapping one-to-one, we need to specify the

origin of momentum space as discussed toward the end of section 3.1. (admittedly, the replacement (3.7) is some-

what misleading.) other possibility is to introduce an additional gauge symmetry to constrain the o-diagonal

components as xr,s = xr+k,s+k (k  z). this gauge symmetry kills the ambiguity of overall shift, but the

clusters need to be arranged periodically on a lattice. the latter method is equivalent to the s1 compactication

proposed by w. taylor [14].

18

here, the standard covariant derivative for the adjoint matter dm = m + i[a, m] and

the eld strength f  = a   a + i[a, a ] is used.

our procedure can be schematically summarized as

xi

    xs

tr     z ddp tr    .

(3.22)

now we make a few comments on the hermiticity of the elds. if we naively interpreted the

brane conguration as the discretization in the spatial coordinates (`a la lattice gauge theory)
rather than the momentum coordinates, then an n  n block x 

rs must be interpreted as a u (n)

connection (or parallel transport) matrix connecting two points xr and xs. then it must be anti-
hermitian (or unitary) matrix. but, since x 

rs is just a part of a much larger n  n hermitian

matrix, there is no a priori reason why it should take such special forms. it might be possible to

rs) = x 

devise a mechanism to put such a constraint, it would lead to additional complication. actually,
the hermiticity as a n n matrix leads to ( x 
x 
rs with a(p), because the hermiticity of the gauge eld a(x) = r ( dp
note also that the diagonal parts x 

sr. this is consistent with our identication
2 )d(a(p)eipx + h.c.)

leads to the condition (a(p)) = a(p).

ii of n n matrix eld correspond to the zero-momentum,

cartan component of u (n ) gauge eld.

4 divergences in large n matrix theory

although the matrix model is dened for arbitrary value of n , interesting physics is believed to

emerge from the large n limit. but there seems to be no general argument or rule concerning

what kind of large n limit should be taken.

it is well known that in the so-called t-hooft limit [13] n   with g2

y m n being xed,

u (n ) yang-mills theory simplies drastically, and some exact analysis, say borel summability

became possible. eguchi and kawai [15] have argued that four dimensional large n gauge theory

can be replaced by matrix models in zero dimensions. in a sense we are studying the reverse

process of the eguchi-kawai reduction from a dierent viewpoint.

in type iib matrix models, g appears as the overall factor in the action and thus there is

no nontrivial critical point for g. yet, it is still controversial [16] how large n limit should be

taken; g xed? g2n xed? or what else?

figure 8: d-instanton conguration corresponding to d-dimensional sym. n d-instantons are

distributed in a d-dimensional ball with radius  within rd

in the case of sym theory embedded in the matrix perturbation theory, one is faced with

an additional complication. increasing n allows two dierent interpretation: (i) larger gauge

symmetry (ii) larger cuto (i.e. more degrees of freedom). in the usual qft case, they are

clearly separated and never mixed. here, however, there is a crosstalk between the two.

in the perturbative computation of d-dimensional quantum eld theory, divergences arise

from the integrals over loop momenta r ddp. we can regularize the integrals by introducing a

uv cuto . suppose the amplitude associated with a feynman diagram  diverges as d()

in the continuum limit   . basically, d() can be determined from the supercial degree

of divergence of  or its subgraphs. renormalizability is the property that all divergence can

be removed if    limit is taken not keeping g xed but adjusting g so as to maintain a

certain functional relation r(g, /) = 0. it is of course a very nontrivial problem to nd the

explicit form of renormalization trajectory r(g, /) = 0, but at least perturbatively, it can be

determined by carefully analyzing the structure of divergences in feynman diagrams.

on the other hand, in the matrix perturbation theory we are working with, only source of

divergence is sending n to innity.6 in the spirit of correspondence between matrix model and

6of course, there are combinatorial divergences due to the innitely many feynman graphs. but this is common

qft, continuum limit    should be related to the large n limit. in other words, adding

more and more d-instantons on the outskirts of the d-instanton cluster should be equivalent

to increasing . in this picture, the uv cuto  is nothing but the distance to the farthest

d-instanton (see fig. 7.), which is natural from uv/ir correspondence [12] or spacetime uncer-

tainty [11].

the analysis of large n behavior can be complicated because there is no unique way to add

extra d-instantons; the relation between the two limits n   and    is highly dependent

on the strategy of putting new d-instantons.

in this section, we will take a phenomenological approach to clarify the relation between

large n limit and continuum limit   . n d-instantons are assumed to be concentrated

along d-dimensional hyperplane with uniform density  as in section 3.5. but here, since n is

nite, the radius  of d-instanton cluster is also nite.

4.1 scaling laws

so far we have encountered various length scales. the core size g1/2, the d-instanton spacing

a, the scale of external momenta . for nite n , the distance  to the farthest d-instanton

will also play an important role. we will study the scaling laws for these length scales. for the

readers convenience they are listed in table 1. although the word length will be frequently

used, they represent momentum scales in the qft picture as we argued in the previous section.

we are interested in how they should be varied as n tends to innity. in this paper, we

assume a simple power law scaling and try to draw some bounds on the exponents from physically

reasonable assumptions.

since the quantities in table 1 are all dimensionful while n is dimensionless, one must decide

to matrix and to both theories and is not discussed in this paper.

carried by the external lines in the qft picture. in other words, all lengths discussed in this
section are measured in the unit of . for example, we set   xij when we compute hx 
jii.
the other three quantities g1/2, a and  are assumed to scale with some power of n which is

ijx 

specied by three independent exponents d,  and  as in table 1.

in addition to these basic length scales, there are some other quantities of interest, with

nontrivial n dependence:

 d-instanton density 

for nite n , d-instantons are assumed to be distributed uniformly with density  within

a d-dimensional ball of radius . thus we have

d  n

since   n (1)/d, (4.1) xes the scaling of the  as

  n .

 cluster spacing b

(4.1)

(4.2)

the d-instanton spacing a and cluster size b are related via nad = bd. since we x the

rank n of the gauge group, a and b will have the same scaling behavior, b  a  n /d.

 cluster density 

by the same token, the cluster density , related to d-instanton density  via n =  will

have the same scaling as .

ym coupling gd in d-dimensions is related to g and  via (3.20). thus it will have a

nontrivial n dependence:

g2
d  g2  n 

(4.4)

we summarize the result in table 2.

4.2 physical bounds on scaling exponents

we have seen that a d-dimensional sym theory emerges from the o-diagonal dynamics of the

large n matrix model.

in order to prove the claim, we need at least to show such a large

n limit is indeed possible  precisely specifying how to arrange the background d-instanton

conguration as n tends to innity. it may be dicult to do this rigorously. we will content

ourselves with obtaining some inequalities among the exponents , , d introduced in section

4.1, so that there occurs no apparent inconsistency in qft side. this would help us applying

matrix theory to more realistic situations in the future.

we will consider several physically reasonable assumptions, but we do not intend to claim

that following conditions are all necessary or sucient.

(i)

interpretation as d-dimensional qft required replacing the discrete sum by d-dimensional

integral. this coarse graining can be justied only when a  b  . this is true in the large n

limit if

  0.

(4.5)

(ii)

from the d-dimensional point of view, cuto scale  must tend to innity. thus we

have

  1.

(4.6)

(iii) as we saw in section 2, the perturbation theory is essentially the expansion in g/a2.

thus it is valid if a  g1/2 is satised. this remains to be true in large n limit if

d   4 .

23

(4.7)

(iv) actually, the same bound can be obtained from a dierent viewpoint. from exact

results for matrix integrals [17, 18, 19], it is reasonable to assume there is a pairwise repulsive

potential among d-instantons due to entropy factor. this could be eectively treated [8] as

each d-instanton has a core size of order g1/2. this implies a & g1/2. sending n to innity, we

obtain the inequality (4.7).

(v) to construct u (n) gauge theory, n d-instantons are put on the same point (see section

3.5). but this assumption might be too strong;

it is possible that the n d-instantons can

disperse in the cluster of size b but are still grouped via (slightly broken) u (n) gauge action

from qft point of view.7 of course, the dispersion size b must be suciently smaller than the

renormalization scale,

b  .

this corresponds to the minimum momentum resolution seen by u (n) yang-mills theory. the

condition (4.8) leads to the bound, (4.5).

(vi) as far as a tree level amplitude or the form of yang-mills action is concerned, the argu-

ment given in (v) is sucient. but if quantum eects are taken into account, it is another story.

just like the anomaly from one loop, large n divergence from loop integrals may overwhelm the

b/  n  suppression discussed in (v) and may yield non-negligible eects.

let us estimate the eect of dispersing d-instantons using the one-loop two point function as

an example. as a function of d-instanton conguration {xk}, the most divergent contribution

is roughly given by

a1-loop[{xk}]

(4.9)

7this claim is not so strange as it sounds. in nature, non-abelian symmetry is exact in uv regime but hidden

in ir regime through connement or higgs mechanism. in our context, the d-instantons within a cluster look

almost coincident in much larger scale .

24

if the d-instanton positions {xk} have a dispersion of order b, a1-loop[{xk}] will change as

a1-loop = a1-loop[{xk + xk}]  a1-loop[{xk}]

the last expression scales as n to the (    

d )-th power. thus, it is negligible

only if

d(1  ) < 3  2

(4.11)

this is the condition when the operators associated with the slight shift of d-instantons are

irrelevant in the sense of large n renormalization group.

(vii)

let us study the problem of renormalizability of d-dimensional theory i.e. whether or

not as n   only a nite number of amplitudes supercially diverge.

from the wilsonian point of view, renormalizability is not a necessary condition for qft,

but a consequence of the renormalization procedure. but it is of some interest in presenting the

analysis since in the context of matrix model, situation is rather complicated.8

for a given feynman graph, the supercial degree of divergence is usually determined from

the number of loops and propagators. the coupling constants just count the number of vertices

and stay xed when the cuto is sent to innity. as we all know, d = 4 is the critical dimension

for gauge theories.

but here, we are talking about the divergence when n tends to innity. recall not only 
d  n . thus usual denition of the supercial

but also gd changes as a function of n , i.e. g2

degree of divergence does not work.

in a sense, we are studying a generalized large n limit in which g2

dn  is kept xed. thus
the standard qft results should follow if we restrict to  = , whereas t hooft limit would

correspond to another special case,  + 1 = .

what is the new rule for the supercial degree of divergence? note that g2 always come in

pair with a sum over d-instantons. from the substitution

g2xk

   = g2z ddp tr(   ) = g2

dz ddp tr(   ),

(4.12)

8for example, it is not clear what is ir limit?

25

extra d-dimensional loop integral is always associated with the factor g2

d. each loop contributes
d  n   d()/(1). it is easy to convince oneself that the

d while the coupling gives g2

net eect is to replace the spacetime dimension d by an eective dimension

de  d +

d(  )

1  

= d

1  
1  

.

thus we have a new criteria about large n renormalizability as follows

de  4  d(1  )  4(1  ).

(4.13)

(4.14)

as promised,  =  recovers the standard result. note that if  = 1, de = 0 for any d, . this

corresponds to the well known fact that planar limit of the 0 + 0-dimensional matrix model

absolutely converge.

(viii) as for the error in replacing sums by integrals, analysis in (vii) can be generalized to

an arbitrary feynman graph . suppose we know the amplitude diverges as

a()  n (),

including n dependence of g2

d. then, the approximation can be justied if

a 

b


n ()  n () 1

d  1.

thus the error is negligible for graphs with suciently low degree of divergence:

it may be useful to introduce eective supercial degree of divergence, de() dened through9

() <

1
d

.

(4.15)

or equivalently

then, (4.15) can be expressed as

de()  n (),

de() =

d

1  

().

de() <

1

1  

  > 1 

1

de()

(4.16)

9de() coincides with usual supercial degree of divergence d() if gd is independent of n .

26

suppose d-dimensional theory is renormalizable in the sense that de() has a -independent

upper bound dmax. then by choosing

 > 1 

1

dmax

,

the error can be neglected for all feynman integrals. in particular, d = 4 sym case (dmax = 2)

leaves as a nite window 1 >  > 1
2 .

if d-dimensional theory is non-renormalizable, de grows with the number l of loops. thus

from (4.16), for a given , there is a maximal number of loops lmax beyond which the approxi-

mation fails. but lmax tends to innity if we approach t hooft limit,   1.

4.3 possible interpretation of exponents

so far we have chosen a particular d-instanton conguration depicted in fig 8 the dimension

d in which qft lives is determined by the number of at directions. but this is clearly a very

special conguration from d-dimensional viewpoint. can we relax the assumption?

in wilsons approach to renormalization group, one can study the origin of ultraviolet di-

vergences by isolating the dependence of the functional integral on the short distance degrees of

freedom of the eld. in matrix approach, short distance degrees of freedom correspond to the

long distance d-instantons. the number n of d-instantons contained in the momentum shell

 < |p| <  +  is given by

n  d1

as   .

in fact, as far as the loop divergence is concerned, dimension d will appear only through this

relation.

consider for example a more generic d-instanton conguration, fig 9. let n () be the

number of d-instantons within a d-dimensional ball of radius . then the space-time dimension

can be dened as the rate of growth of n :

d =

 log n ()

 log 

.

(4.17)

for a uniform conguration like fig 8, denition (4.17) gives the number of at directions. note

that the new denition (4.17) make sense for non-integer dimension d, which may be useful to

visualize the meaning of dimensional regularization.

27

 + 



figure 9: general d-instanton conguration. the number n of d-instantons contained in the

shell  < |p| <  +  is proportional to d1.

in order to enumerate the physical degrees of freedom in a eld theory, one needs to put the

system into a nite box of volume v . the number of states is given by the available phase space

volume.

in order to realize a continuum eld theory in innite spacetime, one needs to take two limits:

n =

v

(2)d z 

ddp .

(4.18)

v  

(large volume limit),

  

(continuum limit).

singularities associated with the former and latter are usually called ir and uv divergences,

respectively. in standard textbooks on qft, v   limit is taken rst so that feynman rules

simplify in the momentum space. subsequently,    limit is carefully investigated. this

asymmetry between the two limits is due to the well known fact that the translational invariance

in momentum space is actually broken by the hierarchical structure.

in the matrix model, however, all limiting processes are unied into a single large n limit.

comparing (3.22) and (4.18), we can say that we have investigated in section 4.2 all possible

limits

to get a continuum eld theory.

5 discussions

in this paper, we have studied the dynamics of large n matrix models through the quantum

uctuations in a xed d-instanton background.

in particular, we have explicitly shown the

correspondence of perturbation theories between the usual qft and matrix perturbation theory.

the correspondence is exact if relative d-instanton positions are interpreted as momenta in qft

picture.

one might think that this is a kind of triviality. indeed, matrix model action is originated

from the yang-mills action by dimensional reduction. it is no wonder yang-mills theory can

be recovered from the matrix model. however, since dimensional reduction is simply throwing

away spacetime coordinate dependence, the reverse procedure would be just re-introducing x

dependence to the matrix elds. but contrary to this naive expectation, the momentum space

picture emerges rst and coordinate picture is recovered only after fourier transformation.

the correspondence exploited in this paper can be regarded as a dual version of eguchi-

kawai reduction [15]. the original suggestion by eguchi and kawai is valid only at strong

coupling [20], whereas we have shown the equivalence in a weak coupling regime.

just like lattice gauge theories, matrix model provides us with a natural gauge invariant reg-

ularization. but matrix regularization has two important features. first, the quantum elds

are discretized in the momentum space rather than ordinary space, and the hierarchical structure

inherent to qft can be understood in a geometrical fashion. second, matrix regularization can,

in principle, be generally covariant if the sum over all background congurations is taken into

account. a permutation of d-instantons is a discrete analogue of coordinate reparametrization.

matrix models pack too much degrees of freedom into a few matrices. as is often the case,

this obscures the meaning of large n limit. furthermore, in a theory with t -duality it is dicult

to make distinction between ir and uv limits. the limits explicitly depend on the eective

dynamics we are talking about. at any rate, it is obvious in matrix theory that universal

behavior is expected only in large n limit.

we initiated a preliminary study of what class of large n limit is possible in order to repro-

duce a qft. key idea is to classify the degree of divergence in terms of n , the only source of

divergence in matrix theory. it is now possible to interpret renormalization group `a la brezin

and zinn-justin [21, 22, 23] in terms of the usual renormalization of yang-mills theory. we hope

29

to report on this elsewhere.

one might well be puzzled by the interpretation of the matrix dynamics as d-dimensional

yang-mills theory. if the background d-instantons are distributed really uniformly, the rank of

the gauge group would be just a matter of choice because it depends how we cut the d-instanton

gas into pieces. let  be the d-instanton density. suppose we decide to call d-instantons inside

a d-dimensional hypercube of size b as a cluster. then we have

n = bd,

(rank of the gauge group)

 = /n = bd,
d = (2)dg2 = (2)dg2bd.
g2

(cluster density)

(yang-mills coupling)

note that b dependence cancels in the t hooft coupling   g2

dn = (2)dg2. therefore, matrix
perturbation theory suggests that any universal property of u (n) gauge theory with adjoint

matters should depend, not separately on gd or n, but on t hooft coupling   g2

dn, at least for

suciently small .

at present, we do not know whether this is generally true or not, but the following evidence

should be taken seriously. consider a renormalization group beta function for d = 4 yang-mills

coupling,

(g4) = 0g3

4  1g5

4     .

in a u (n) gauge theory with adjoint matters (c2(g) = n), the coecients are given by 0 =
c0n, 1 = c1n2, . . . with c0, c1, . . . depending only on the matter contents. thus we have

(g4) = c0 n g3

4  c1 n2g5

4     .

this can be rewritten as

() = 2(c03 + c15 +    ).

the right-hand side is a function of  only, in accordance with our expectation.
