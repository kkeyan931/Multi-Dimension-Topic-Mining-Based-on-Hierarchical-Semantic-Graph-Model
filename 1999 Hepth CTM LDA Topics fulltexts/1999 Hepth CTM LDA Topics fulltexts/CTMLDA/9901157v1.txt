abstract

massless elementary-particle propagation is represented historically (cosmologically) through

3-scale towers of quartet rings within a lattice of magneto-electrodynamically communicat-
ing pre-events. the lightlike intervals within a ring of 4 pre-events (discrete closed string)
display transverse gut-scale and longitudinal particle scale. the lightlike (longitudinal)
spacing between successive rings of a tower is at planck scale. ratio between gut scale and
planck scale relates quantum-dynamically to elementary magnetic charge. permutations of a
ring quartet, in conjunction with lorentz-group representations, control elementary-particle
quantum numbers.

i. introduction

a historical quantum cosmology, based on lattice coherent states labeled locally
by pre-event chains, has been formulated(1). the constraints dening history lat-
tice include causal (i.e., lightlike) magneto-electrodynamic (med) pre-event connec-
(2) the present paper oers historical representation of massless elementary-
tions.
particle propagation through a special history pattern describable as a tower of
magnetically- conned pre-event quartet rings that display both gut scale and a
much larger particle scale. spacing between successive rings is at a third, more fun-
damental, local scale that historical cosmology identies with planck scale1. ratio
between gut and planck scales will here be related to elementary magnetic charge.2

1this paper ignores a global scale, hugely larger than any of the 3 scales discussed here (although smaller

than local age), that relates to distinction between present and past(1).

2magnetic charge is screened at scales above those characterizing quartet rings while localized energy,
dened through towers, is devoid of meaning at lower scales. historical cosmology thus precludes magnetic
charge carried by matter.

1

although the present paper does not address historical representation of interac-
tion between elementary particles, many of the principles invoked here are relevant to
particle- interaction (e.g., pair of pants) pre-event patterns  which may be called
local events in contrast to pre-events. our concluding section calls attention to
one such principle: the continuity, along a history-chain segment, of electric charge
and certain other discrete quantum numbers.

a tower-propagator history pattern might be described as a closed string moving
in spacetime, but the string is discrete (comprising 4 pre-events with gut-scale
spatial spacing and particle-scale temporal spacing) and its motion is discrete (in
planck-scale steps). despite history-lattice discreteness, the (continuous) lorentz
group plays a central historical role, discreteness being reserved to lorentz invariants.
local physics blends into global cosmology within a discrete history that relies on the
lorentz group at all scales. local lorentz covariance, while not an exact feature
of historical cosmology, is approximately valid for velocities currently accessible to
physical observation.

ii. towers of interleaved pre-event ring quartets

reference (1) prescribes a history lattice with a longitudinal chain structure.
matter representation requires further a transverse ring structure. steps along the
chain and intervals around a ring are both lightlike. the longitudinal chain step has
a xed interval  in pre-event age (age is dened below). it has been conjectured
that the value of , once meaning for the gravitational constant has been identied
within historical cosmology, will turn out to be on planck scale. the fundamental
parameter  establishes a smallest scale for historical cosmology.

although longitudinal chains comprise hubble-scale closed loops, to the extent
that each longitudinal loop contains a number of pre-events (> 1060 for loops passing
close to our region of the universe) much larger than the pre-event number building a
typical propagator tower (particle collision times are presumed small on hubble scale),
this paper will disregard the compactness of (longitudinal) history-chain segments.
such a posture conforms to physics disregard of distinction between present and
past.

the number of pre-events in a transverse ring is exactly 4 with each member
of a pre-event ring quartet belonging to a dierent segment of the (longitudinally-
looping) history chain. the term ring means the 4 pre-events are cyclically ordered.
adjacent pre-events around a ring have opposite  sign magnetic charge and lightlike
spacetime separation (they communicate, with alternation of advanced and re-
tarded connections). in the ring quartets building propagator towers, the magnitude
of any pre-event magnetic charge is the elemental e; passing around a ring, magnetic-
charge sign alternates. opposing pre-events (across the ring from each other)
share not only the same magnetic charge (both +e or both e) but the same age.
opposing pre-events do not (directly) communicate with each other, being spacelike
separated. the mean spatial separation between opposing pre-events will be found

2

to exhibit gut scale.

the magnitude of the age dierence (an integer multiple of ) between magnetically-

positive and magnetically-negative pre-events within a quartet is common to all rings
within tower (matter-propagation) history patterns. this dierence will be designated
by the symbol . section iii will associate the term particle scale with  and argue
that  must be huge on gut scale in order to achieve the approximate local lorentz
covariance of particle physics. a matter-representing ring quartet exhibits gut scale
spatially and particle scale temporally, with planck scale characterizing the spacing
between successive rings building a tower.

according to reference (1), all history (whether tower or otherwise) occupies the
interior of a forward big-bang lightcone. such an idea rst appeared in the cosmology
of milne.(5) spacetime location of pre-event n is given by a positive-timelike 4-vector
xn prescribing pre-event displacement from lightcone vertex. pre-event age n is the
lorentz magnitude of xn. (pre-events in our neighborhood have ages of order 1010
years or  1060 in units of ).

let us designate those 4 pre-events building a ring quartet q by the index pair
(q, i) with i cyclic  i.e., i4 is the same as i. a pre-event pair (q, i) and (q, i  1)
are adjacent; their lightlike separation means

(xi

q  xq

i1)2 = 0, i = 1, 2, 3, 4.

a pair (q, i) and (q, i  2) are opposing, with spacelike separation:

3 lorentz boost parameters spatially locate ring center with respect to big-bang ver-

counting center age, a ring has a total of 7 external degrees of freedom. (when
dierent rings combine into a larger history pattern, such as a tower, some of the
separate-ring external degrees of freedom become internal to the larger pattern.
the total number of external degrees of freedom for any pattern is 7, corresponding
to a lorenz transformation plus an age.)

that is deducible from formulas (4).....(8).

there is a lightlike displacement from pre-event (q, i) to the following (older,
by the increment ) pre-event along its history-chain segment. a unique set of 4
displacements, connecting a pair of longitudinally-adjacent quartets within a tower,
is determined by requiring that quartet orientation and shape remain unchanged
throughout a tower, and that displacement of quartet center be orthogonal to the two
(xed) orthogonal transverse spacelike directions. by shape is meant the ratio of
the two transverse distances dq
. a tower is thus characterized by the orientation

+/dq

5

and shape of any of its constituent ring quartets. the direction of tower axis
corresponds to propagation direction. the magnitude dq varies from one quartet to
the next as the age of each pre-event increases by the increment , but in a mature
(dilute)region of the universe, where   (/)2, the fractional variation is of
order / . for purposes of mature-region physics (as opposed to cosmology), a
tower is characterized by a single width d. quantum uctuation of d is nevertheless
important.

notice that, with  > , age spacing between magnetically-positive and magnetically-

negative pre-events within the same ring quartet is larger than spacing between same-
sign pre-events of (longitudinally) adjacent quartets. there is interleaving of ring
quartets within a tower. the electrodynamic considerations of the following section
indicate a value of  huge compared to .

collision times (age intervals between successive collisions of elementary parti-
cles) are meaningless if smaller than  because individual ring quartets are unsus-
tainable. more generally, the tower history pattern is essential to the very meaning of
matter. within historical cosmology, matter (localized energy) is only an approx-
imate concept, meaningful at spatial scales larger than d and temporal scales larger
than . extremely close to big bang where towers are unsustainable, localized energy
loses signicance.

iii. pre-event impulses within a tower

each pre-event is endowed not only with a positive-timelike spacetime-location
xn but with a spacelike 4-vector impulse qn and a positive timelike unit-magnitude
charge 4-velocity un that is orthogonal to qn. in a tower, as this section will elaborate
on the basis of reference (2), charge velocities are longitudinal while impulses are
transverse. reference (2) prescribes history-lattice constraints that causally (and
linearly) determine the impulse at a pre-event from the electric and magnetic charges
and charge velocities at those other pre-events located on its lightcone. (impulses,
like spatial separations between pre-events, are subject to quantum uctuation.)

within a tower history pattern in a mature region of the universe, there is near
med cancellation from sources on that history-chain segment containing the pre-
event whose impulse is being calculated. we concentrate here on med interactions
within a single ring quartet, there being within a tower no lightlike-separated (i.e.,
communicating) pre-event pairs that locate on dierent history-chain segments and
also locate in dierent ring quartets. the interacting pre-event pairs within a ring
quartet are those 4 pairs adjacent to each other around the ring. the impulse at any
pre-event is generated by the charges of its two ring neighbors, whose magnetic
charge is of sign opposite to its own. electric charge is less constrained. each of the
4 history-chain segments may carry electric charge 0,  e. (in section iv, photon
coupling to electric charge indicates that at least one of the 4 chain segments building
a charged-particle tower carries zero electric charge.)

in a mature region of the universe, the displacement between centers of suc-

6

cessive quartets is nearly at maximum velocity  corresponding to massless-particle
propagation. the success of lorentz-covariant local eld theories (such as qed) that
make no distinction between charge and matter velocity (and no reference to a special
frame) implies a tower charge velocity close to maximum; direction should be longi-
tudinal. the unique longitudinal 4-direction internal to a quartet is that of uq.
in the absence of alternative we postulate for any charge velocity within quartet q,

uq = uq/dq.

(16)

such assignment implies spatial direction of uq in the direction of propagation (not
in the spatially reversed diretion).

what is meant by a magnitude of charge velocity close to maximum? cosmol-
ogy provides an answer to this question through the special lorentz frame belonging
to quartet center. this frame, approximately shared by all history within a region
small on the scale of  q (hubble scale), is the frame in which cosmic background
radiation is approximately isotropic (analog of co-moving coordinates in standard
cosmology).

in quartet-center frame,

xq = ( q,~0),

uq = dq(coshq, ~nt sinhq),

where ~nt is a unit 3-vector prescribing propagation direction and

coshq = xq  uq/dq q.

referring to (15), we nd in mature-region approximation,

cosh 


d

.

in center frame, magnitude of charge velocity is

tanh  [1  (

2

d
 )

]1/2.

(17)

(18)

(19)

(19)

(20)

close to maximum thus means huge 
d . the success of lorentz-covariant models
that tie charge velocity to matter velocity (and ignore the special lorentz frame)
requires a huge order of magnitude for /d, with the age interval  establishing a
scale that we optimistically call particle scale, expecting eventually to connect 

7

with particle-physics data. hugeness of cosh q means that all longitudinal 4-vectors
characterizing internal tower structure are almost lightlike; approximate lorentz
covariance for earth-based particle physics then becomes possible.5

with e  e, the largest contribution to the med impulse at pre-event

(q, i) arises from its magnetic charge interacting with the magnetic charges of its two
neighbors. the prescription of reference (2) gives, for magnetic impulse,

(21)

the direction being inwardly-radial  toward tower central axis.
(note that all
previous 4-vector relations in this paper have implicitly involved only upper  index
4-vectors.) radial magnetic-impulse magnitude is

qq,mag

(dq)3 .

(22)

magnetic coulomb attraction provides transverse stability for a tower of quartet
rings 6.

electric impulses proportional to eiei1, being smaller than (22) by a factor of
order (e/e)2, cannot undo tower stability even when repulsive (i.e., when outwardly-
radial). there are no impulses proportional to ee, a product we expect to be con-
strained in a manner paralleling that discovered by dirac(4), once quantum super-
position of history is systematically addressed. this paper will not be systematic in
such regard.

formula (22) for the radial impulse, nevertheless, in conjunction with qualita-
tive quantum considerations, suggests the order of magnitude of dq. when towers
of dierent dq
 are superposed, minimum uctuation (ground state)7 is plausibly

formula (22) then yields the estimate

5qualitative successes of primordial nucleosynthesis calculations(3) indicate that collision times remain
meaningful at scales as low as 1023 sec. an upper limit on / in the neighborhood of 1020 is thereby
set. phenomenological considerations by coleman and glashow(6) indicate a lower limit for cosh  in the
neighborhood of 1011.

6longitudinal stability is provided by persistence of electric and magnetic charges, along with other

discrete indices, along any segment of the (looping) history chain.

tower structure has now been characterized by 3 dierent scales  ,  and

gests association of mean dq with gut scale. propagator-towers within the history
lattice, that is to say, have gut scale mean transverse dimension 8. a mean value of
cosh  in the neighborhood of 1016 might then be compatible with /  1018.

v. conclusion

although not pursued here, quantum superposition of external tower lorentz
parameters provides meaning for massless elementary-particle momentum and helicity
via representations of the lorentz group9. choice of representation involves an 8-
valued sector index (in addition to electric and magnetic charge) that is carried
by each history-chain segment. four of the 8 values, denoted in reference (1) by
s1, s1, s2, s2, are suitable for patterns of material history. the index interchanges
s1  s1 and s2  s2 have a signicance paralleling (local) particle-antiparticle
conjugation. the 1  2 interchange has a global signicance. the outlook for
historical cosmology depends on whether ring-quartet patterns of electric charge,
spin and internal quantum numbers conform to the discoveries of particle physics.
permutation-group (s4) analysis in conjunction with lorentz-group representation
must be undertaken.

the 4-remaining values of sector index, denoted t1, t1, t2, t2 in reference (1),
contribute to nonmaterial patterns of history that tentatively have been called
vacuum. coupling of vacuum to material history is conjectured to suppress
large-scale uctuation of past material history. (historical cosmology distinguishes
present from past, even though such a distinction has played no role in this
paper.) many worlds(7) i.e., material past histories that are distinct at scales far
above particle scale  are not anticipated.

we conclude with supercial remarks about the notion that a photon couples
to electric charge. the general pair of pants pattern joins 3 towers with continuity
of history-chain segments10. it is plausible that a photon ring quartet carries electric
charges +e, e, 0, 0, with e one-third the magnitude of charge carried by elementary
electrons. the ring quartet of an elementary particle capable of emitting or absorbing

8alternatively one might say that closed strings of 4 pre-events have gut-scale radius. the dynam-

ical considerations of the present section might be regarded as an estimate of string tension.

9fluctuation in transverse location of tower center is not to be confused with the tower width d.
10some history-chain segments must reverse their direction of age change in any pair of pants pattern (a
requirement that excludes the sector indices t1, t1, t2, t2 from material history); the sign of physical charge
carried by the reversing segment corresponding reverses, just as in a feynman graph.

9

a photon must then include at least one pre-event of zero electric charge and at least
one of charge e. total electric-charge possibilities for charged elementary particles
would then be e, 2e, 3e.
