(1) qcd renormalization group invariant, change simultaneous changes . actually take limits feasible moment, since supergravity approximation breaks 0. supergravity approximation ads/cft approach temperature plays role ultraviolet cuto, coupling = g2 n bare coupling scale . string tension saddle point approximation proportional 2 . coupling is, however, arbitrary parameter (as long large), seem run scale . causes problem {$9806235$} concerning comparison string tension glueball masses strong coupling limit . underlying string picture glueball masses expected proportional square root string tension, like lattice gauge theory even away continuum limit, true glueball masses proportional temperature without factor. therefore, strong coupling limit glueball spectrum appear consistent underlying string picture, glueballs would come closed strings, hence masses proportional square root string tension {$9806235$}. although situation could certainly improved one goes g2n g2n 0, strange ads/cft approach involve string picture behind glueballs even strong coupling limit. problem indicates denition bare coupling reconsidered. following therefore propose (renormalization) principle scale glueball masses , glueball masses = const. (1 + o(1/t )), (2) right string scale, proportional square root string tension. consistency supergravity calculation around saddle point, coupling still go innity . invoke renormalization condition clearly possible leading order, since would require order one. however, uctuations string included, string tension acquires logarithmic corrections {$9901057$}. reason somewhat unexpected behavior two transverse bosonic world sheet elds become massive, whereas remaining six transverse elds remain massless. massive elds contribute logarithmic term string tension 2, string tension 2 = 8 27 2 4t 2 ln 2 2 (1 + o(1/t )) .
