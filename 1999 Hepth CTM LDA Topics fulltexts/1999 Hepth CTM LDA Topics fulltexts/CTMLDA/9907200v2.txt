abstract

we quantize the superstring on the ads2  s2 background with ramond-ramond
ux using a p su (1, 1|2)/u (1)  u (1) sigma model with a wz term. one-loop conformal
invariance of the model is guaranteed by a general mechanism which holds for coset spaces

g/h where g is ricci-at and h is the invariant locus of a z4 automorphism of g. this
mechanism gives conformal theories for the p su (1, 1|2)  p su (2|2)/su (2)  su (2) and
p su (2, 2|4)/so(4, 1)  so(5) coset spaces, suggesting our results might be useful for
quantizing the superstring on ads3  s3 and ads5  s5 backgrounds.

1. introduction

two dimensional sigma models with target space supermanifolds naturally appear in

the quantization of superstring theory with ramond-ramond (rr) backgrounds. these

sigma models possess manifest target space supersymmetry and have no worldsheet spinors.

the fermionic elds are worldsheet scalars as in the usual green-schwarz (gs) formalism.
it was recently shown that a sigma model on the supergroup manifold p su (1, 1|2) can
be used for quantizing superstring theory on the ads3  s3 background with rr ux
[1,2]. in this paper, we show that the sigma model dened on the coset supermanifold
p su (1, 1|2)/u (1)  u (1) can be used to quantize superstring theory on the ads2  s2
background with rr ux. furthermore, we show that this sigma model is one-loop con-

formal invariant and we expect that it is conformal to all orders in perturbation theory.
our methods can also be used to produce one-loop conformal sigma models for ads3  s3
and ads5  s5 backgrounds. in the last case, incorporation of the model into a consistent
superstring theory remains to be done.

there are two conventional approaches for describing the superstring, neither of which

has been useful for quantizing the superstring in backgrounds with rr ux. one such ap-

proach is the covariant gs formalism where spacetime-supersymmetry is manifest and

worldsheet supersymmetry is absent. the covariant gs superstring action can be dened

classically in any background which satises the supergravity equations of motion. when

the background elds satisfy these equations, the gs action is classically invariant un-

der -symmetry which is necessary for removing unphysical fermionic degrees of freedom.
recently, this classical action was explicitly constructed for the case of the ads5  s5
background [3,4]. like the at ten-dimensional gs action, the ads5  s5 action has four-
dimensional and six-dimensional classical analogs  the ads2  s2 and the ads3  s3
actions respectively [5,6]. unfortunately, it is not known how to quantize any of these gs

actions.

another conventional approach to constructing superstring actions uses the rns for-

malism where quantization is straightforward since the action is free in a at background.
the rns formalism was successful for quantizing the superstring in an ads3  s3 back-
ground with ns/ns ux [7]. however, the rns approach has not been used to describe

the superstring in rr backgrounds because of the complicated nature of the rr vertex

operator.

over the last ve years, an alternative approach to constructing superstring actions

has been developed which combines the advantages of the gs and rns approaches [8].

1

like the gs approach, this hybrid approach uses spacetime spinor variables as fundamental

elds, allowing simple vertex operators for rr elds. and like the rns approach, it reduces

to a free action for a at background, so quantization is straightforward. the worldsheet

variables of the hybrid formalism are related to the rns worldsheet variables by a eld

redenition, and the action contains critical n = 2 worldsheet superconformal invariance

which replaces the -symmetry of the gs action. this n = 2 worldsheet superconformal

invariance is related to a twisted brst invariance of the rns formalism and is crucial for

removing unphysical states.

the only disadvantage of this hybrid approach is that ten-dimensional lorentz in-

variance cannot be kept manifest. the maximum amount of invariance which can be

kept manifest (after wick-rotating) is a u(5) subgroup of the lorentz group [9]. how-

ever, depending on the desired background, there are other ways of breaking the manifest

lorentz invariance which are more convenient. for example, one choice is to break the
so(9,1) lorentz invariance down to so(5, 1)  u (2) [10]. this choice is convenient for
describing compactications of the superstring to six dimensions and was used succesfully
in [1] (see also [2]) for quantizing the superstring in an ads3  s3 background with rr
ux. the worldsheet description of strings propagating on ads3  s3 is given by a certain
modication of a sigma model on p su (1, 1|2). another choice is to break the so(9,1)
lorentz-invariance down to so(3, 1)  u (3) [11,12]. this choice is convenient for describ-
ing compactications of the superstring to four dimensions and will be used in this paper
for quantizing the superstring in an ads2s2 background with rr ux. the sigma model
presented here is based on the coset supermanifold p su (1, 1|2)/u (1)  u (1).

as was shown in [1] and [2], the p su (1, 1|2) sigma model is conformal invariant be-
cause of the ricci atness of the group supermanifold. to get an ads2s2 model, one has
to form a coset space by dividing p su (1, 1|2) by a u (1)  u (1) subgroup. unfortunately,
the resulting coset space turns out not to be ricci at. indeed, on general grounds, only
division by symmetric subgroups1 preserves ricci atness. nevertheless, the u (1)  u (1)
subgroup is quite special  it is the invariant locus of a z4 automorphism of p su (1, 1|2). it
is also a symmetric subgroup of the bosonic part of p su (1, 1|2). thanks to this z4 action,
one can add a wz term that can be used to restore one-loop conformal invariance. this

wz term is d-exact and the corresponding interaction can be written in terms of manifestly

1 h is a symmetric subgroup of g if it is the invariant locus of a z2 automorphism of g.

p su (1, 1|2) left invariant currents. this mechanism for constructing a conformal eld the-
ory works for any coset space g/h, provided that g is ricci at and h is the invariant
locus of a z4 automorphism of g. for example, superstring theory on ads3s3 can be ob-
tained from a conformal eld theory based on the p su (1, 1|2) p su (2|2)/su (2) su (2)
coset2. our construction also works for the p su (2, 2|4)/so(4, 1)  so(5) coset mani-
fold and leads to a conformal eld theory that could be the starting point for quantizing
superstring theory on ads5  s5.

the ads2  s2 background appears as the near horizon limit of a four-dimensional
extremal black hole. to realize this background in type iib string theory one has to

consider compactication on a calabi-yau (cy) manifold x and wrap an appropriate

number of 3-branes over 3-cycles of x. the four-dimensional metric would be that of an

extremal black hole. the ten dimensional geometry is not a direct product and the complex

moduli of the cy vary as a function of the radial coordinate of the black hole. in the near
horizon limit the cy moduli are xed by the attractor equation [14] and x  xattr. at
the attractor point the periods (pi , qi) of the cy are proportional to d-brane charges

im(cpi ) = qi ,

im(cqi ) = qi ,

(1.1)

where qi and qi are electric and magnetic charges and c is a complex constant. the cy
xattr is uniquely xed by the d-brane charges (1.1), up to the complex constant c 3. the
radius of ads2  s2 is given by

r =

1

4pqiqj nij

(1.2)

where nij is the vector superpotential [15]. the conformal theory describing the strings
in the near horizon geometry (ads2  s2 background) factorizes into the product

(cid:16)ads2  s2(cid:17)  xattr  h ,

(1.3)

where the rst factor is the conformal eld theory of ads2  s2 constructed in this paper,
the second factor is a sigma model on the calabi-yau xattr (which can in principle be
replaced by any internal n = 2 c = 9 superconformal theory), and the last factor is the

2 the details of this construction and its relation to [1] will be discussed in [13].
3 this complex constant will be related in section (2.3) to the vacuum value of the supergravity

vector compensator.

3

conformal theory of a free chiral boson . the product (1.3) is not exactly a direct product

since changing the d-brane charges adjusts the cy moduli xed by (1.1) and at the same
time changes the radius of ads2  s2. this adjustment is ensured by the presence of
manifest four dimensional n = 2 supersymmetry in our model. the d-brane charges are

quantized, but this is a non-perturbative eect that cannot be seen in the perturbative

worldsheet theory.

the plan of this paper is as follows: in section 2, we shall review the four-dimensional

version of the hybrid action in a at [11] and curved [12] background, and then discuss
this action in an ads2  s2 background with rr ux.
that this hybrid action is equivalent to a sigma model action for the coset supermanifold
p su (1, 1|2)/u (1) u (1) including a wess-zumino term. this action is similar to the gs
action considered by zhou [5](which was based on the ads5  s5 action of metsaev and
tseytlin [3]), but has a crucial dierence  it includes a metric for the fermionic currents.

in sections 3-4, we shall show

the -symmetry is explicitly broken by the kinetic term for fermions and is replaced by

n = 2 worldsheet superconformal invariance. at the end of section 4, we compute the

one-loop beta functions and show that they vanish for a certain coecient in front of the

wz term. we demonstrate that the sigma model on the coset space g/h with the wz

term is one-loop conformal invariant provided that the group g is ricci at and h is the

xed locus of a z4 automorphism of g.

in section 5, we present a geometrical proof of one-loop conformal invariance based on

target-space considerations. the target space of our sigma model is the coset supermanifold

g/h with a g-invariant background metric gab and an invariant antisymmetric tensor

eld strenth habc. the choice of wz term (i.e. antisymmetric eld strength h) is a subtle

modication of the usual one which is possible because of z4 symmetry. after computing

the curvature of super coset spaces, we show that the non-vanishing ricci curvature of the

coset space is cancelled by the habc stress tensor in the appropriate einsteins equations.

moreover, habc satises its own eld equation. in addition, we conrm that the dilaton

expectation value is constant to two loops because the coset supermanifolds in question

have vanishing scalar curvature.

finally, in section 6 we speculate on the possible relation between conformal eld theo-
ries on the coset spaces p su (1, 1|2)p su (2|2)/su (2)su (2) and p su (2, 2|4)/so(4, 1)
so(5) and quantization of the superstring in ads3  s3 and ads5  s5 backgrounds.

2. hybrid superstring in four dimensions

we will start by describing the hybrid action based on the so(3, 1)  u (3) splitting
of the lorentz group [11,12]. this action is very similar to the four-dimensional version

of the gs action, but includes some crucial additional terms. as will be reviewed below,

the type ii four-dimensional gs action contains four -symmetries which are replaced

by n = (2, 2) superconformal invariance in the hybrid action. there are three main

dierences, however, between the four-dimensional gs action and the action based on

the hybrid approach. firstly, the action in the hybrid approach is a free action in a

at background, so quantization is straightforward. secondly, it includes compactication

elds which cancel the conformal anomaly. and thirdly, the action contains a term coupling

the dilaton zero mode with the worldsheet curvature, so scattering amplitudes have the

expected dependence on the coupling constant.

2.1. hybrid approach in a at four-dimensional background

before discussing the ads2  s2 background, it will be useful to review the action in
the hybrid approach for a at four-dimensional background. in the so(3, 1)u (3) version
there are ten bosonic spacetime variables which split into x m for m = 0 to 3, y j and yj for
j = 1 to 3. the y j and yj variables describe the compactication manifold while the x m
variables describe the four-dimensional spacetime. as in the rns approach, the hybrid

with y j and yj. one also has sixteen fermionic worldsheet variables transforming as four-

model has left-moving fermions (j, j) and right-moving fermions (bj,bj) associated
dimensional spinors which split into (, p), ( , p ) (b,bp), (b ,bp ) for ,  = (1, 2) 4.
the s and bs correspond to the left-moving and right-moving fermionic variables of
n = 2, d = 4 superspace and the p s and bp s are their conjugate momenta. finally, one
has a chiral and anti-chiral boson which will be called  and b. one can show that the

fermions and chiral boson of the hybrid formalism are related by a eld-redenition to the

ten s, two bosonic ghosts and two fermionic ghosts of the rns formalism. the six rns

s from the compactication directions are not quite the same as the six s in the hybrid

formalism, but are related by a factor involving the ,  ghosts.

4 the fermionic directions are labeled by [, ,b,b] but in order to simplify the notation (in

those cases where there is no confusion), we will put a hat only on top of the elds , , p, p, ... .

5

in a at or toroidal background, the worldsheet action for these elds in superconfor-

mal gauge is

+bpb +bp b  + y j yj + j  j + bj bji ,

(2.1)

where we have not tried to write the action for the chiral and anti-chiral boson  and .

the action of (2.1) is quadratic so all elds are free and it is completely straightforward

to compute their opes. we only consider the type ii superstring in this paper, so all

worldsheet elds satisfy periodic boundary conditions.

the above action is manifestly conformal invariant, and it also contains a non-manifest

n = (2, 2) superconformal invariance. the left-moving n = 2 generators are given by

the n = 2 generators of (2.2) split into two pieces, one piece depending on the
six-dimensional variables (y j, j), and the other piece depending on the remaining four-
dimensional variables (x m, ,  , p, p , ). one can check that the six-dimensional con-
tribution forms an n = 2 c = 9 algebra while the four-dimensional contribution forms an

6

n = 2 c = 3 algebra, summing to a critical n = 2 c = 6 algebra. the above action is
easily generalized to the case when the six-dimensional compactication manifold is de-

scribed by an n = 2 c = 9 superconformal eld theory. in this case, one simply replaces

the at six-dimensional contribution to the action and n = 2 generators by their non-at

six-dimensional counterpart.

the four-dimensional type ii green-schwarz action in conformal gauge.

2.2. type ii action in a general curved background

described in [12], it is easy to guess the following action in a curved background:

is written in terms of the supervierbein em

a as a

j = em

ajzm with zm =

(x m, ,  , bb, bb), and the index a takes the tangent-superspace values [c, , ,b,b].
once again, to simplify notation we denote b as b and b as b . in other words, we

put the hat over the symbol instead of the index. we will also use this rule for all other

7

worldsheet elds. but we will use the standard notations [c, , ,b,b] for the background
elds such as qb.
spinor indices [, ] and [b,b] correspond to the left and right-moving degrees of

freedom and c is a vector index. the lowest component of ec
m is the vierbein and the lowest
components of e
m are the gravitini. the antisymmetric eld bm n is the two-form
supereld where the lowest component of bmn is the ns/ns two-form. the superelds

m and eb

p b and p b contain the self-dual and anti-self-dual parts of the rr graviphoton eld-
strength as their lowest components. similarly, the superelds qb and q b contain the

derivatives of the two rr scalars as their lowest components. the last term in (2.7), sc,
is the action that describes the compactication manifold.

in a at background, one can check that the action (2.7) reduces to (2.6). furthermore,

linear perturbations around the at background reproduce the massless vertex operators
of [12]5.

they can be expressed in terms of the free elds p and p using the denitions (2.3). if d and

note that d and bd are fundamental elds in the action of (2.7), and in a at background,
bd are set to zero and the compactication elds are ignored, the action of (2.7) is precisely

the four-dimensional version of the covariant gs action in a curved background. when the

background satises certain torsion constraints, the covariant gs action has -symmetries

which allow half of the s to be gauge-xed. however, it has only been possible to quantize

this action in light-cone gauge, which is not accessible for arbitrary backgrounds [16].

by including the d and bd elds, as well as the chiral boson  and the compactication

elds, it is possible to covariantly quantize the action (2.7) in a manner analogous to the

normal-coordinate expansion used in bosonic string or rns superstring sigma models. in

a curved background, one still has an n = 2 superconformal invariance at the quantum

level if the background elds are on-shell. the n = 2 left-moving generators are given by

g = ei(d)2 + gc,

2

 + tc ,

z + d  

z +

g = ei( d)2 + gc,

(2.8)

j = i + jc ,

5 as explained in reference [12], the complete type ii action also contains a fradkin-tseytlin
term which couples the spacetime dilaton to the n = (2, 2) worldsheet supercurvature. but since
the dilaton is constant in the ads2  s2 background, this term will only give the contribution

r r + ar f where r r is the worldsheet euler number, r f is the worldsheet u(1) instanton

number (coming from the u(1) gauge eld of the n=2 worldsheet), and eia is the background
value of the supergravity vector compensator z 0 (which is related by supergravity equations of
motion to the dilaton and ns/ns axion background values) [12].

8

where [tc, gc, gc, jc] are the n = 2 c = 9 generators describing the compactication
manifold. one can check that the classical equations of motion of (2.7) imply that (d)2 and
( d)2 are holomorphic, so the n = 2 generators are holomorphic at least at the classical level
[12,16]. holomorphicity at the quantum level is expected to imply that the background

superelds satisfy their low-energy equations of motion. this has been explicitly checked

at one-loop for the heterotic superstring in a curved background [16], but has not yet been

checked for the type ii superstring in a curved background. so the action of (2.7) is

still a conjecture at the quantum level but we will provide evidence for this conjecture by

explicitly showing that the one-loop conformal anomaly vanishes when the background is
chosen to describe ads2  s2.

2.3. type iia action in ads2  s2 background with rr ux

to describe the ads2  s2 background with rr ux, one simply needs to substitute
in this background, the eld-strength of the

the values for the superelds into (2.7).

rr graviphoton is equal to f01 = f23 = n where the integer n counts the number of
branes. but in the presence of a type iia (or type iib) calabi-yau compactication

with h kahler moduli (or h complex moduli), there is some ambiguity which of the h + 1

rr vector elds is called the graviphoton. there is an auxiliary two-form, t , in the
supergravity multiplet whose on-shell self-dual part satises the equation of motion [17]

where p, q, r, s = 0, ...h, z0 = eia is the supergravity vector compensator, zp /z0

p b = ( z0)1f b = ( z0)1n (01) b = ( z0)1n  b .

(2.10)

the dependence of p b on the string coupling constant g = e can be understood by
recalling that the e2 term is absent in the f f kinetic term for the rr eld. so p b is
related to the rr eld strength by a factor of g. the dependence of p b on the phase

9

factor eia from (z0)1 comes from its non-zero r-charge where eia is related to the phase
of the constant c in (1.1). in the rest of this paper, we shall assume that a = 0 although

all our formulas can be generalized to non-zero a by simply rotating all elds by a phase

factor proportional to their r-charge.

note that the h linear combinations of eld-strengths which are not turned on are

given by

for p = 1, ...h. this can be seen from n = 2 d = 4 spacetime-supersymmetry since the

in the above action, a and bab are dened in precisely the same manner as in the
covariant gs ads2  s2 action of zhou [5], which was based on the ads5  s5 action of
metsaev and tseytlin [3]. however, the second and third lines of (2.12) are not present

in the usual gs action and are crucial for quantization. as discussed in [5] and will be
reviewed in the next section, the objects a can be constructed out of currents of the
supergroup p sl(1, 1|2)/u (1) u (1). in the ads2  s2 background, bab can be written
in the following simple form:6

in the ads3  s3 and ads5  s5 backgrounds. equation (2.13) is easy to prove since

backgrounds is exact in the group-invariant sense, i.e. that the b eld can be constructed out

of the supersymmetric currents. this simple form for bab was originally found in [18] which
considered a version of the gs superstring with two types of fermionic symmetries.

supergravity equations. in (2.14), we have used the torsion constraints of [12] to relate the

torsion components to the ramond-ramond eld-strengths by the equations

implies that d and bd are auxiliary elds. substituting the equations of motion for d and bd

into (2.12) and taking (2.13) into account, one obtains

the n = 2 superconformal generators are the same as in (2.8) with d replaced by

its equation of motion, and the compactication-independent part of the stress tensor

will be shown in section 3 to be the conformal generator for a sigma model based on the
supergroup p su (1, 1|2)/u (1)  u (1). note that the action and constraints are invariant
under the transformation which takes the bosonic currents c  c, the fermionic
currents   i and b  ib, and which shifts    +  and    + . the presence

of this z4 symmetry will be important later.

7 this rescaling is chosen such that the torsion constraint for t c

  remains independent of n g.

2.4. perturbative derivation of ads2  s2 action

in the hybrid action for ads3  s3 of reference [1], the action was justied using a
ramond-ramond vertex operator to perturb around a at background. this justication
was important in the ads3  s3 case since there did not exist a hybrid action for the
general six-dimensional type ii superstring background. although the existence of (2.7) as

a hybrid action for the general four-dimensional background [12] makes such a justication
less necessary in the ads2s2 action, we shall show in this section that such a perturbation
is possible and leads to the same result of (2.16).

the vertex operator in a at background for a constant graviphoton eld-strength

f 01 = f 23 = n is given by

v = n gz dzdz (qbq +   

) ,

q bq

(2.18)

where the g dependence in v comes for the same reason as in (2.10) and q is given in terms

of ps and s by (2.4). it is clear that v is a physical operator since the supersymmetry

currents q commute with the n = 2 constraints of (2.2). adding v to the at action of

(2.1) produces the action

s =

)(cid:17) + sc .

(2.19)

now one can integrate the qs out, and keeping terms only up to the cubic order in elds,

one can just replace q = (n g)1b and bq = (n g)1 . finally, integrating by parts

and using the fact that terms proportional to  x m or   can be removed by redening
x m or , one can write the action as

s =

3. ads2  s2 from the p su (1, 1|2)/u (1)  u (1) coset

from the work of [1] and [2], it is natural to expect that quantization of strings
in the ads2  s2 background requires a sigma model based on a quotient supermanifold
p su (1, 1|2)/u (1)u (1). in this section, we discuss this coset supermanifold and its higher
dimensional analogs. we also introduce a z4 symmetry that will play an important role

in our considerations. finally, we construct a sigma model action as a gauged principal

chiral eld. the model constructed in this section is not conformal and the necessary

modication (a wz term) will be discussed in the next section.

as we will conrm in this and in the next sections, the action (2.17) indeed combines
the sigma model and the wz terms of the p su (1, 1|2)/u (1)  u (1) coset. to make the
identication, one notices that the objects [c, ,  ,b,b ] generate global p su (1, 1|2)

rotations and can be identied with the sigma model currents.

3.1. coset spaces and z4 symmetry

let us start this section with a discussion of the signature of the coset space. there are
two closely related cosets, p su (2|2)/u (1)u (1) and p su (1, 1|2)/u (1)u (1), that dier
by the choice of real structure on the group. the rst coset is based on the su (2)su (2) 
p su (2|2) and leads to the s2  s2 geometry with the signature being (2, 2). the other
coset leads to the ads2  s2 geometry with the signature (1, 3). clearly, the physics of
these two backgrounds is very dierent, but they share many common algebraic properties.
the super lie algebras psu(2|2), psu(1, 1|2) are the algebras of 4  4 matrices with

bosonic diagonal blocks and fermionic o-diagonal blocks

m =(cid:18) a x

y b(cid:19) where tra = trb = 0 .

(3.1)

the bracket is dened to be the commutator projected on the doubly-traceless subspace.
the supertrace is dened as str(m ) = t ra  t rb and the (super) antihermiticity condi-
tion for psu(2|2) is [19]

m  (cid:18) a
ix 

b (cid:19) = m  a = a , b = b , x = iy .
iy 

(3.2)

13

ix 3

b (cid:19) = m  a = 3a1

in other words, the grassmann even matrices a, b are traceless antihermitian, and the
grassmann odd x, y matrices are related to each other.8 for the case of psu(1, 1|2), the
anti-hermiticity condition is
m  (cid:18) 3a3 i3y 
the bosonic geometry of the p su (1, 1|2) is ads3 s3, so to construct a string theory
on ads2s2, we have to quotient the group by (the right action of) u (1)u (1). the rst
u (1) is embedded into su (1, 1) to produce ads2, while the second is embedded into su (2)
to give rise to s2. since p su (1, 1|2) has already the right number of fermions (8 real ones),
we divide only by a bosonic subgroup. for a reason that will become clear later, we will
think of this subgroup as an invariant locus of a z4 automorphism. both for psu(1, 1|2)
and psu(2|2) the z4 automorphism is generated by conjugation m  (m )  1m 
with the matrix

, b = b , x = i3y . (3.3)

3

 =(cid:18) 3

i3(cid:19) .

(3.4)

this conjugation respects the anti-hermiticity conditions given above and manifestly gives

an algebra automorphism. in addition, the invariant subalgebra (m ) = m is the desired
bosonic u(1)  u(1) algebra. finally, 4(m ) = m .

since this z4 automorphism will play a key role in our construction, it is of interest
to show that it is also present for other adsd  sd spaces of relevance. for example,
ads5s5 appears as the bosonic part of the super-quotient p su (2, 2|4)/so(4, 1)so(5).
in general, the lie superalgebra psu(n, n|2n) has a z4 automorphism whose invariant locus
is usp(n, n)  usp(2n) [20]. the anti-hermiticity condition for psu(n, n|2n) is as follows
m  (cid:18) a iy 
where  = 3  in and in is (n  n) identity matrix. then the z4 automorphism is
generated by
0 (cid:19) . (3.6)
m =(cid:18) a x

b (cid:19) = m  a = a , b = b , x = iy  ,

where j =(cid:18) 0 in

in

8 antihermitian (super)matrices form a superalgebra because (m n ) = n m . on block
matrices dagger means transposition composed with ordinary complex conjugation ( (12) =

12).

14

while it is not expressed as conjugation, one can verify that it is a lie algebra automor-

phism compatible with the antihermiticity condition (3.5). moreover, its fourth power is
the identity and the z4 invariant locus is precisely usp(n, n)  usp(2n). when n = 2,
su(2, 2)  so(4, 2), usp(2, 2)  so(4, 1), usp(4)  so(5) (see [21]) and we recover the
quotient that leads to ads5  s5 geometry. other group signatures can be discussed
similarly9.

the z4 action can be used to decompose the lie algebra g as

g = h0  h1  h2  h3 ,

(3.8)

where the subspace hk is the eigenspace of the z4 generator  with eigenvalue (i)k. the
subspaces h1 and h3 contain all the fermionic generators of the algebra g and h2 contains
the bosonic generators of g that are not in the subalgebra h0. the denition of z4 implies
10. given that z4 is an automorphism of the lie
that the hermitian conjugate of h1 is h3
algebra, the decomposition khk satises

[hm, hn]  hm+n (mod 4) .

the bilinear form is also z4 invariant and hence

hhm, hni = 0 unless n + m = 0 (mod 4) .

(3.9)

(3.10)

9 let us also mention that there is an alternative way to impose a hermiticity condition based
on a second way to dene complex conjugation on grassmann variables. this conjugation, de-
noted #, satises [22]: (c)# = c #, (#)# = ()deg(), and (12)# = #
antihermiticity condition is

2 . the alternative

1 #

m + (cid:18) a+

x + b+(cid:19) = m  a = a+ , b = b+ , x = y +

y +

(3.7)

where on block matrices + denotes transposition composed with #-conjugation. note that
(m n )+ = n +m +. the above antihermiticity condition is also compatible with the z4 ac-
tion (3.6) and restricts psl(2n|2n) (over the complex) to psu(2n|2n) and the invariant locus to

usp(2n)  usp(2n) (usp(4)  so(5) for n = 2).

10 the eigenvectors in h1 and h3 thus give a complex basis for the real lie algebra g.

15

h2 = {k01, k02, k13, k23}

h1 = {s + ies(cid:12)(cid:12)  = 0,    3.}
h3 = {s  ies(cid:12)(cid:12)  = 0,    3.} .

(3.13)

to illustrate these ideas concretely, we present the basis for the psu(2|2) algebra

explicitly and the z4 decomposition. the lie brackets of the algebra are

[k, k] = k  k  k + k ,
[k, s] = s  s ,
2   k  ,
{s, s} = 1

(3.11)

where the indices , , ,  = (0, ...3) and ,  = (1, 2). the invariant bilinear form in the

algebra is

hk, ki =  ,

hs , si =  .

(3.12)

denoting s  s1 ,es  s2, one obtains for the z4 invariant subspaces:

h0 = {k03, k12}

the reader can explicitly check that this decomposition satises (3.9) and (3.10).

3.2. sigma model action

the easiest way to construct a sigma model action on the coset space is by gauging
the subgroup h whose lie algebra is h0 (which will sometimes be simply called h). let
g(x)  g describe the map from the worldsheet into the group g. the current j = g1dg
is valued in the lie algebra g. introducing the gauge eld a taking values in h0, one can
dene a gauged action

s[g, a] =

1

42 z d2x str(cid:0)j  a(cid:1)2

.

(3.14)

it is convenient to decompose the current j into two pieces j (0)  h0 and j   (g \h0) =
h. there is a natural metric on g, given by (a, b) = str(ab) which allows us to make a
canonical choice of j  such that str(j j (0)) = 0. now consider the gauge transformation
g(x)  g(x)h(x). taking into account that [h0, h]  h (the subgroup h is reductive)
we get that j  transforms by conjugation j   h1j h. meanwhile, the current j (0)
transforms inhomogeneously as j (0)  h1j (0)h + h1dh. the inhomogeneous term in

16

this transformation cancels the inhomogeneous transformation for the gauge eld a, such
that the action (3.14) remains invariant.

integrating out the gauge eld a, we obtain an action for the sigma model on a coset

space

s(0)
g/h =

1

42 z d2x str(cid:0)j 2(cid:1) .

(3.15)

it is clear that this action is gauge invariant with respect to the gauge transformation
g(x)  g(x)h(x) and therefore is dened on the coset space g/h. the group g acts on
the coset space by global left multiplication, namely for coset representatives [g] and group
element g0  g we have g0 : [g]  [g0g]. it is clear that j  (as well as j) is invariant under
this transformation. observe that the action (3.15) can be easily generalized by replacing
the str() by any ad(h) invariant metric b(j , j ). the invariance of the metric implies

that the action would still possess the same gauge invariance.

the sigma model action (3.15), however, cannot be the right string worldsheet action

since this sigma model is not conformal. at one loop, a counter term proportional to the

ricci tensor gets generated. as we will see in section 5, the ricci tensor for the quotient
p su (1, 1|2)/u (1)  u (1) is non-zero.

4. wz term and conformal invariance

in order to make the theory conformal, we modify the action by adding an extra

term. this term will be a special version of a wz term. let us rst remind the reader the

structure of the wz term for a supergroup. for a (super) group g, the wz term arises

from a closed 3-form. indeed, the three form reads

 = str (j  [ j  j] ) = fm nk j m  j n  j k ,

(4.1)

where j a are left-invariant one forms dened as g1dg =pm j m tm , fm nk  gm p f p
nk
are the totally (graded) antisymmetric structure constants, and gm n is a g invariant
bilinear form on g. the wz term is simply the integral of the pullback of  over a three
manifold whose boundary is the world sheet. one can readily verify that d  = 0 making

use of the maurer cartan identities

dj k = 

1
2

[j  j]k = 

1
2

f k
m n j m  j n ,

(4.2)

17

and the jacobi identity for g. the three form should be closed, so it is at least locally
exact and thus can arise from a two-form b.

the possibility of writing the wz term for the g/h coset arises due to the very
special nature of the subgroup h  g. the group g admits a z4 automorphism and the
subgroup h is the xed locus of this action (see for example (3.4), (3.6)). this is a general
statement which is valid for any coset p su (n, n|2n)/u sp(n, n) u sp(2n). in this paper,
we will mainly deal with the ads2  s2 case (n = 1) and make some comments on n = 2.
let us denote the projections of the 1-form j on the corresponding subspaces hk of

(3.8) as

j (i) = j|hi .

(4.3)

the naive restriction of the three-form e to g/h (obtained by letting indices run only

over coset values) is not even closed11. still, one can write a wz term using the z4 decom-
position of the algebra. this wz term is precisely that of [5] (which is a straightforward

generalization of the wz terms in [3,4,6]) and can be written as

 = str(cid:0)[j (1)  j (1)]  j (2)  [j (3)  j (3)]  j (2)(cid:1) .

(4.4)

this 3-form is closed and its variation is exact. let us introduce the indices {i, j, k,   } for
h0, {a, b, c,   } for h1, {l, m, n,   } for h2, and {a, b, c,   } for h3. then the 3-form 
(4.4) can be rewritten as

 = fmab j m  j a  j b  fmab j m  j a

 j b

.

(4.5)

using the maurer-cartan identities (4.2) for the one-forms j a and j a
that the wz 3-form  given above is d-exact

, it is easy to check

 = d str(j (1)  j (3)) = d (gaaj a  j a

)  d (2).

(4.6)

the full action can now be written as the sum of the kinetic term (3.15), and the (two-
dimensional) integral of (2)

11 the rules for working with forms and exterior derivatives on homogeneous spaces g/h were

reviewed in [23].

18

where k will be determined later12. let us stress that this action diers from that of

[36] since it contains a kinetic term for fermions. this kinetic term breaks -symmetry,

however, instead it allows n = 2 worldsheet superconformal invariance. to construct the
n = 2 superconformal generators, it is useful to rewrite the action as (with 01 = +1)

sg/h =

z + (1 + k)j (1)

although the coecient k can be xed by requiring one-loop conformal invariance, we

can try to guess the appropriate value of k by examining the classical equations of motion.

taking into account that the variation of j satises the equation j = dx + [j, x], we

obtain

note that when k = 1/2, the actions of (4.8) and (2.17) agree since c is identied with

j (2), b and b  are identied with j (1),  and   are identied with j (3). furthermore,
the four elements of j (1) decompose under h = u (1)u (1) as (j (1)
12 the coecient i in (4.7) makes the contribution of the wz term to the euclidean worldsheet

and we are not aware of any quantization condition that would require this term to be imaginary.

19

the rst two are identied with  and the second two are identied with  . so we can
dene two classically holomorphic, h invariant combinations of j (1) which are

a+ = j (1)

++j (1)

, a = j (1)

+j (1)

(4.11)

where we dropped the z, z indices. we conjecture that the 2d qft theory given by (4.8)
is exactly conformal for k = 1/2 and that the composite elds a+(z) and a(z) remain

holomorphic at the quantum level. this could be checked by perturbative calculations.
furthermore, we conjecture that the opes of a+ and a form some version of a w -

algebra

a+(z)a(w) = 

1

1

(z  w)4 +

(z  w)2 t +

1

(z  w)

w3 ,

(4.12)

where t is the stress-tensor and w3 is some new spin-3 current. the opes of a+ and a
with themselves should be regular. the conformal anomaly of this w -algebra coincides
with the superdimension of the coset space which is c = 4. it follows from our calculations
of the eective action that the w-algebra persist at one-loop level. remarkably, it is

closely related to an n = 2 superconformal algebra and can easily be converted into

one by adding an extra chiral boson . let us x the normalization of  by requiring
that h(z)(w)i = log(z  w). then the elds ei have dimension  = 1/2 and the
combinations g = eia together with stress-energy tensor t + 1
2  and u (1) current
j = i generate a c = 3 n = 2 superconformal algebra. adding any n = 2 c = 9
superconformal eld theory for the cy manifold to this model produces a critical n = 2

c = 6 superconformal eld theory. this superconformal eld theory is precisely the one
described in the previous section where a+ = (d)2 and a = ( d)2. it is related to the
rns version of the superstring by using the rns stress tensor, brst current, b ghost, and

ghost number current as twisted n = 2 generators, redening the worldsheet variables,

and then untwisting to get a critical c = 6 superconformal eld theory [8,10].

4.1. one loop beta function

in this subsection we use the background eld formalism to compute the one loop
eective action and verify that there are no uv divergences for k = 1/2. we write group
elements as g = gex where g is the background eld, x  g parameterizes quantum
uctuations around g, and  is the coupling constant (i.e. the inverse radius of ads2  s2)
inserted here for convenience. then the current j can be written as

j = g1g = ex jex + ex ex ,

(4.13)

20

where j = g1g is the background current. the action for the coset space is given by
(4.7) which in our parameterization becomes

1

22 z str(cid:16) 1

+

sg/h =

2(cid:0)ex jex|g\h0 + ex ex|g\h0(cid:1)2
+ik(cid:0)ex jex + ex ex(cid:1)|h1(cid:0)ex j ex + ex ex(cid:1)|h3(cid:17).
the gauge invariance of the original action g  gh (where h  h) allows us to choose
a gauge for x such that x  g \ h0. the gauge invariance of the eective action for
the background eld becomes manifest in this gauge for x. under g  gh we simply
change variables x  h1xh in the functional integral. as the subgroup h is reductive,
h1xh  g \h0 and so we are still in the same gauge for x. the action (4.14) is invariant
under such transformations. the integration measure is certainly invariant for k = 0 since

(4.14)

there is no chirality. for all other k, we may use the same regulator as for k = 0 to see

that the measure is invariant. the gauge invariance of the eective action guarantees that

our theory makes sense on the coset space even quantum-mechanically.

to compute the eective action for our model, we rst have to expand (4.14) in terms

of x and then evaluate all 1pi diagrams with external lines of the background currents
j. to compute the beta function we need to renormalize uv divergent diagrams. the ir
divergences can be dealt with in the standard fashion by adding a small mass term  for

x. by power counting, the uv primitively divergent diagrams can have no more than two

external lines. thus we need to evaluate those.

the expansion of (4.14) contains the zeroth order term in x that is simply the action

for the background eld and the linear term in x which does not contribute to 1pi dia-

grams. we are interested in terms of second order in x which are the only ones we need

to compute the one-loop beta function. there is the kinetic term for x that is simply

1

4 z d2x str(cid:0)x(cid:1)2

,

(4.15)

and terms which include interactions between j and x. these terms can be divided into
three subsets: (i) terms containing j (2), (ii) terms containing j (1)
and (iii)
terms containing j (3)

the one-loop eective action.

(4.18)

the rst two terms above have the same group factors as those in (4.17), so adding them
makes the coecients in front of both equal to 1/4 + k2. their sum can be written in

terms of the group factor in the third term of (4.18) since the groups we choose for our

coset constructions have vanishing dual coxeter number, which implies, in particular that

the (l, m) components of the cartan-killing form vanish:

0 = flab fbam gbb

gaa

(4.19)

adding the contributions from both types of diagrams and using (4.19), we nd that the

sum is equal to

(4.20)

thus, there is no renormalization only when k = 1/2, which are the same values of k
that we guessed using the classical equations of motion (4.9).

again, the rst term above has the same group structure as in (4.22) while the second can
be expressed through it using vanishing of the a, a components of the cartan-killing form
in a way similar to (4.19). summing both types of diagrams in this case gives

which vanishes for the same values of k = 1/2. terms of type (iii) in the expansion of the
action can be dealt with in the same manner and with the same conclusion that k = 1/2.
one can immediately deduce from the above results that the one loop beta function
for 1/2 is proportional to (2k2  1
2 ), while the renormalization of k is identically equal
to zero independently of the values of  and k. we therefore conclude that the couplings

 and k are not renormalized at one loop. in fact, we believe that the the theory given
by (4.8) is exactly conformal for k = 1/2 and we plan to address this issue in the near
future.

5. ricci curvature, field equations and conformal invariance

here we study the geometrical properties of coset supermanifolds. we rst show

how to compute the ricci curvature of homogeneous supermanifolds g/h in terms of

structure constants of the associated lie algebras. in doing this, we will explain the role

of the chosen lie algebra metric. this will illuminate the metric interpretation of the

work of [1] and [2]. then we compute the curvature of g/h in terms of the curvature of
g plus additional terms. these formulas will conrm that p su (1, 1|2)/u (1)  u (1) and
p su (2, 2|4)/so(4, 1)  so(5) are not at and therefore the corresponding sigma models
require some modication for conformal invariance.

in the second subsection, we present another proof of one-loop conformal invariance

of our model. we show that the background elds implied by the kinetic term and wz

term satisfy the appropriate target space eld equations that arise from the conditions of

one-loop conformal invariance. this approach makes use of the geometrical properties of

the coset in question. we also show that there is no two-loop correction to the central

charge.

5.1. ricci curvature and lie algebra metrics

we consider here metrics on homogeneous supermanifolds obtained as coset spaces

g/h where g is a lie supergroup and h is a sub(super)group of g. our discussion is a

generalization of the familiar results for bosonic cosets [24,25] to the super case. a useful

reference is [26].

we focus throughout on reductive coset spaces, i.e. spaces where the lie algebra g
can be decomposed as a direct vector space sum of the lie algebra h of h and an ad(h)
invariant space g \ h. we choose a basis {tm} of generators for g, and use the letters
{m, n, p,   } to index the generators of g, the letters {i, j, k . . .} to index the generators
of h and {a, b, c . . .} for the elements of g \ h.

assume that g has an ad(g) invariant bilinear form (tm , tn ) = bm n whose re-
striction to h is non-degenerate and thus can be used to produce a reductive orthogonal
decomposition g = h  (g \ h). the homogeneous space admits a g-invariant metric
arising from the restriction of the bilinear form b to g \h. the following result then holds
for the curvature of this metric ([24], vol. 2, p. 203):

rabdc + (b  d) =

1
4

f e
ab bef f f

cd + f i

ab bij f j

cd + (b  d) .

(5.1)

24

it is clear that the riemann curvature tensor does depend on the choice of bilinear b. to
nd an expression for the ricci curvature, we contract with the inverse metric bbd

rac =(cid:16) 1

ab bef f f

cd + f i

ab bij f j

cd(cid:17) bbd = 

1
4

ad f d
f e

be  f i

ad f d
ci

(5.2)

the bilinear form drops out of the ricci tensor as a consequence of its group invariance
and the orthogonality of g \ h and h. this is the desired result for the ricci curvature
of a ordinary homogeneous manifold g/h. we now claim that for a super coset manifold

we simply need to replace one of the contractions by a supertrace:

rab (g/h) = 

1
4

f e
ad f d

be()e  f i

ad f d

ci ()i .

(5.3)

it should be noted that structure constants of a lie superalgebra are commuting numbers
and thus f m

p q = 0 unless (m ) = (p ) + (q)(mod 2). it follows that rab vanishes unless
both a and b are commuting or both are anticommuting. as a consistency check of the
above equation, one can verify the expected exchange symmetry rab = ()abrba, and
that (5.3) agrees with results derived in [26]. note that as in the bosonic case, the ricci

curvature is independent of the bilinear form. when h is the identity, the result (5.3)

reduces to

rm n (g) = 

1
4

f p

m q f q

np ()p = 

1
4

str (tm tn ) =

1
4

m n ,

(5.4)

where tm are the generators of g in the adjoint representation p (tm )n = f p
m n and 
is the cartan-killing metric on g (positive denite for compact semisimple lie algebras).
this is an important fact: the ricci curvature of a g  g invariant metric on g depends
only on the cartan-killing form  on g. this conrms the metric interpretation of the
computation of [1,2]. their p su (1, 1|2) metric arises from the dening representation of
su (1, 1|2) but its ricci curvature is still given by the killing form which vanishes.

5.2. further results and the curvature of p su (1, 1|2)/u (1)  u (1)

the ricci curvature of a group g, as given in (5.4), takes a useful form when g has

a subgroup h. a small calculation making use of exchange symmetries gives

rab(g) = 

1

(5.5)

25

where we use the index convention of the previous subsection. if h denes a symmetric
subgroup (i.e. [g \ h , g \ h]  h), then

rab(g) = 

1
2

f i
ad f d

bi ()i .

(5.6)

combining (5.3) with (5.5), we nd the following two expressions for the ricci curvature

of a coset:

rab(g/h) = rab(g) 

rab(g/h) = 2rab(g) +

1

(5.7)

(5.8)

note that the extra terms involve sums over h indices in (5.7) and involve sums over g \h
indices in (5.8).

it will also be useful to have an expression for the scalar curvature r(g/h) of the

coset in terms of the scalar curvature r(g) and the scalar curvature r(h). decomposing

the scalar curvature of g in terms of subgroup and coset indices, we nd

r(g) = rij (g)gji + rab(g)gba ,

(5.10)

where the rst step is proved by raising and lowering indices using ff id = gf ef e
id =
()f gef ff id, and the total graded antisymmetry of the structure constants with three
lower indices. the second step made use of (5.7). finally, using (5.9), we nd that

id, f e

r(g) =

1
2

r(g/h) +

1
2

rab(g)gba + r(h) .

(5.11)

let us now consider the computation of the ricci curvature for the special cases.

when g/h is a symmetric coset space, we nd from (5.8) that

rab(g/h) = 2rab(g)

[g/h symmmetric] .

(5.12)

26

so if we take a ricci at supergroup and divide by a symmetric subgroup, we get a ricci at
coset, thus a one-loop conformal sigma model. the coset space g/h = p su (1, 1|2)/u (1)
u (1), however, is not symmetric. because h does not contain fermionic generators while
there are bosonic generators in g \ h. indeed the bracket of a fermionic generator and
any bosonic generator in g \ h would be a fermionic generator in g \ h. thus, there
is no reason to expect this coset space to be ricci at. to show that the curvature
of g/h = p su (1, 1|2)/u (1)  u (1) is denitely non-vanishing, note that gb/h is a
symmetric space, where gb = su (2)  su (2) = s3  s3 denotes the bosonic subgroup of
g. when g is arbitrary, h is bosonic, and gb/h is symmetric, (5.7) and (5.6) gives

rab(g/h) = rab(g) + rab(gb)

(a, b  gb).

so for p su (1, 1|2)/u (1)  u (1), we nd that

rab(g/h) = rab(gb) = rab(s3  s3) 6= 0 ,

(5.13)

(5.14)

since the ricci curvature of round spheres is necessarily nonvanishing. a similar result
holds for p su (2, 2|4)/so(4, 1)  so(5), so it also has non-vanishing ricci curvature.

5.3. field equations

we begin our analysis by recalling the familiar background eld equations that arise

from the conformal invariance conditions on two dimensional bosonic sigma models. when

the target space is a manifold with metric g , antisymmetric eld b and dilaton ,
the sigma model action takes the form [27]

s =

+

+

1

1

4 z ddabax bx g (x)
4 z ddabax bx b(x)
8 z dd r()(x) .

(5.15)

the conditions of conformal invariance imply that background elds satisfy the equations

27

(5.16)

where g and b have been calculated to one loop, while the  term in  arises at two
loops.

in the case of the bosonic sigma model, the condition of vanishing beta function implies

the target-space equations of motion. here we want to use this statement when the target
space is a supermanifold. formally, one only needs to replace the bosonic indices ,    
by indices a, b,    running over bosonic and fermionic values14. being a part of string
theory, the adsn  sn sigma model should be supplemented by a set of ghost cfts and
an internal space cft as described in the previous sections. this cancels the conformal
anomaly, implying that the term (d  26) in  can be set to zero. moreover, for the
adsd  sd model, we expect to have a constant dilaton so the equations of motion become

np ()p = 0 ,

m q h q

m n = rm n +

np = ()mm hm np = 0 ,

r = 0 .


3

(5.17)

the rst two equations are conditions of one-loop conformal invariance while the third

equation guarantees that the conformal anomaly is not renormalized at two loops.

in

fact, these equations are too restrictive and can be relaxed without breaking worldsheet

conformal invariance. namely, the r.h.s. of these equations can be replaced by the gauge

transform of the corresponding elds (i.e. the transformation of the g and b eld under

dieomorphisms plus the gauge transformation of the b eld).

let us begin with the einstein equation, the rst of the above. for a wzw model for a
group manifold, comparison with (5.4) shows that setting h m
np makes the equation
work. in our case of a coset manifold g/h, taking into account (5.8) and rab(g) = 0,
the einstein equation become

np = f m

rab(g/h) =

1

f e
ad f d

be ()e =

be ()e .

(5.18)

we see that a naive attempt to identify habc with structure constants would fail. we
can examine our proposal of section 4 to identify the h eld. the wz 3-form is given by

(4.5) and we will repeat this expression here

 = habc j a  j b  j c ,

= fmabj m  j a  j b  fmab j m  j a

 j b

.

(5.19)

14 sign factors that would disappear in the bosonic case are sometimes necessary, and can

generally be found by considerations of symmetries under exchanges of indices.

28

this implies that the only non zero components of h are hmab = fmab, hmab = fmab ,
and those with the indices m, a, b or m, a, b being permuted. indeed, the eld strength

h equals the structure constants only up to some crucial sign factors. raising indices we

nd

mb = f a
ab = f m
ab

,

h a
mb = f a

ab = f m

ab .

(5.20)

it is easy to check that with the hs listed above (5.18) is satised: with indices only

running over the coset, and due to the z4 grading, we can only have (a, b) = (n, m), and
(a, b) = (a, b) (or vice versa). in both cases the products in the right hand side always

involve an h from the rst column in (5.20) and an h from the second column. this

conrms that the einstein equation (5.18) is satised.

we now verify the last equation in (5.17)  the scalar curvature r of the coset su-

permanifold vanishes. this is readily done with the help of equation (5.11). since the

numerator group g is ricci at, we have r(g) = 0 and rab(g) = 0. moreover, the group
h is purely bosonic and corresponds to ads2  s2 or their higher dimensional counter-
parts. while the ricci curvature of h does not vanish, its scalar curvature does. it follows

from these facts that r(g/h) = 0, which is the desired result. the central charge of the

coset model remains unchanged to two loops.

finally, we turn to the second equation in (5.17); the eld equation for the three-form.

for the coset case it reads

()aahabc = gaf f habc = gaf (f habc +   ) ,

(5.21)

where the dotted terms denote contributions proportional to the christoel connection.

because of homogeneity, it is sucient to check that (5.21) holds at the identity point of

g/h. at this point, to be denoted as 0, the christoel coecients vanish and we have

()aahabc(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)0

= gaf (f habc )|0.

it will be useful to treat this left hand side as a two-form, introducing the notation

b  gaf (f habc)|0 j b  j c .

(5.22)

(5.23)

we will now show that the z4 automorphism of the group g together with its ricci
atness guarantees that b is d-exact. this is sucient for one-loop conformal invariance

since it implies that the relevant counter term is a total derivative in the two-dimensional

29

eective action. indeed, as it was shown in section 4, the z4 action and ricci atness are
enough to ensure one-loop conformal invariance. moreover, we will show that when h is
semisimple, b vanishes identically. the cases of adsn  sn for n = 3, 5 are of this type.
the case n = 2 is dierent, but b vanishes anyway.

to evaluate (5.23), we need the expansion of habc (x) to linear order in x. for this,
bcx bdx c +   , and,  = habc(x)dx a  dx b  dx c, which

2 f a

one uses j a = dx a  1
lead to

habc(x) = habc  1

2(cid:16)hebc f e
+ ()af haec f e

f a

f b + ()(a+b)f habe f e
replacing into (5.23) and noticing that gf afaf e = 0, we nd

b  gf a(cid:16)()c(b+f ) hacef e

f b + ()(b+c)f habe f e

cf(cid:17)j b  j c .

(5.24)

(5.25)

for (5.25) to be non-vanishing, z4 symmetry implies that (b, c) = (m, n), (b, c) = (b, c)
or (b, c) = (b, c). for (b, c) = (m, n), expanding out, substituting the values of h, and
using the jacobi identity, we get an answer proportional to vif i
mnj m  j n, where vi  f a
ai.
for the case (c, b) = (c, b), using the jacobi identity and the vanishing of rcb(g), we
nd a single term proportional to vif i
. evaluating the relative coecients of the
various terms, one nds

bcj b  j c

jk j j  j k(cid:17) ,

 j c + f i
aif i
jk = f a

(5.26)

b  vi(cid:16)f i

mn j m  j n + f i

bc j b  j c

+ f i

bc j b

where the last term has been added by hand using vif i
jk = 0, a fact that follows
from the jacobi identity of g. now, using (4.2), one can rearrange (5.26) into the d-exact
term:

b  vi dj i = d (vij i) ,

(5.27)

which is sucient for one-loop conformal invariance since it implies that the worldsheet

counter term is a total derivative, i.e. it can be removed by a gauge transformation of the

b eld.

for the ads2  s2 case, the r.h.s. of (5.27) vanishes since, using (3.13), one can check
that vi = f a
ai = 0. for the higher dimensional ads cases the lie algebra of the subgroup
h is semisimple and therefore every generator ti can be written as a commutator of other
generators. as a result, the vanishing of vi is implied by the vanishing of vif i
jk discussed
above. this concludes our verication of the target space equations of motion.

30

6. string theory in 6 and 10 dimensions

as we already mentioned in the previous section, our ads2  s2 computations can be
repeated for ads3 s3 and ads5 s5 backgrounds by replacing p su (1, 1|2)/u (1) u (1)
with p su (1, 1|2)  p su (2|2)/su (1, 1)  su (2) or with p su (2, 2|4)/so(4, 1)  so(5)
and choosing the appropriate z4 action. the wz term is given by the expression (4.4)
in all of these cases. although our results only prove one-loop conformal invariance, we

conjecture that these actions are conformally invariant to all loops and therefore describe

conformal eld theories.

the remaining problem for the higher dimensional cases is to construct a consistent

string theory from the conformal eld theory of these coset spaces. in the six-dimensional
case, the conformal anomaly of the coset model is equal to c = 10. as discussed in
[10,1], there are two ghost-like chiral bosons which are necessary for n = 2 worldsheet

superconformal invariance and which contribute c = +2 to the conformal anomaly. as

will be shown in [13], the remaining c = +8 to cancel the anomaly comes from the ghosts

for harmonic constraints which eliminate half of the fermionic currents and reduce the
p su (1, 1|2)  p su (2|2)/su (2)  su (2) coset model to the p su (2|2) model discussed
in the ten-dimensional case, one would have to add a c = +22 ghost
in [1] and [2].

system to cancel the anomaly. unfortunately, the lack of a covariant gs formalism in ten

dimensions makes it unclear how to add this additional ghost system. to understand the
string theory in ads5  s5 background it may be important to analyze the w algebra of
the corresponding coset.

it might be interesting to try to formulate string theory on an arbitrary supermanifold.

this idea is very simple but is not easy to implement. sigma models on supermanifolds are

generically non-unitary, so one needs to nd a set of constraints (analogous to the n = 2

superconformal constraints of this paper) to remove the negative-norm states. although

such constraints are known for some special cases (e.g. those related to the rns superstring

by a eld redenition), they are unknown in general form.

we have given a formulation of string theory on an interesting four-dimensional back-

ground involving rr elds. we hope our results will pave the way to the construction of

full string theories for the higher dimensional cases.
