classical 1/4 bps congurations consist of 1/2 bps dyons which are positioned by

competing static forces from electromagnetic and higgs sectors. these forces do not

follow the simple inverse square law, but can be encoded in some low energy eective

potential between fundamental monopoles of distinct types.

in this paper, we nd

this potential, by comparing the exact 1/4 bps bound from a yang-mills eld theory

with its counterpart derived from low energy eective dynamics of monopoles. our

method is generalized to arbitrary gauge groups and to arbitrary bps monopole/dyon

congurations. the resulting eective action for 1/4 bps states is written explicitly,

and shown to be determined entirely by the geometry of multi-monopole moduli spaces.

we also explore its natural supersymmetric extension.

1 introduction

recently there have been much activity in trying to understand the nature of 1/4 bps dyonic

congurations in n=4 supersymmetric yang-mills theories [1, 2, 3]. the n=4 supersymmetric

theories arise as an eective low energy theory of parallel d3 branes in the type iib string theory [4].

the expectation values of the six higgs elds are the coordinates of these d3 branes in the transverse

six space. when d3 branes lie on a line, or all higgs expectation values are aligned in lie algebra,

there can be only 1/2 bps congurations. most general 1/2 bps states are collections of 1/2 bps

dyons whose electric charges are all proportional to the magnetic charge, individually as well as

collectively. when the expectation values of the higgs elds are not aligned, on the other hand,

there can be 1/4 bps congurations, which have a nice string interpretation as multi-pronged

strings [5]. as a eld theoretic solution, a 1/4 bps conguration can be thought of as more than

one 1/2 bps dyons at rest with respect to each other; the positions of the component dyons are

determined by a delicate balance of the electromagnetic coulomb and higgs forces [1]. because of

this, the relative electric charges of distinct-type dyons are functions of their relative positions.

the low energy dynamics of 1/2 bps monopoles has been explored before in many directions,

but only in the context of aligned vacua where no static forces among monopoles are possible. the

1/2 bps congurations are characterized by their moduli parameters, and manton proposed that

the low energy motion of 1/2 bps monopoles be treated as the geodesic motion on the moduli

space[6]. there are several explicitly known moduli space metrics. for a pair of identical monopoles

in su(2) gauge theory, the moduli space is the atiyah-hitchin manifold[7]. for a pair of distinct

monopoles in su(3) theory, it is the taub-nut manifold [8], and so on.

on the other hand, the low energy dynamics of bps solitons in misaligned vacua has been

more problematic.

in the simplest example of su(3) gauge theory, a 1/4 bps conguration is

known to consist of two 1/2 bps dyons that are separated by a xed distance, at which the

coulomb repulsion due to the relative electric charge is exactly balanced against a static attraction

induced by higgs interaction. the explicit form of the potential for the higgs force, however, has

not been well understood.

recall that the low energy dynamics of bps solitons explores physics that deviates a little bit

from the bps bound. thus, in certain limit where 1/4 bps states are almost 1/2 bps, it should

be possible to rediscover physics of 1/4 bps congurations from the dynamics of 1/2 bps states.

since we have static forces between 1/2 bps solitons in misaligned vacua, the simplest possibility

is to add a potential term to the moduli space dynamics. in this paper, we nd such a low energy

1

eective action that describes both the 1/2 bps and the 1/4 bps congurations in misaligned

vacua.

the bps equations for the 1/4 bps congurations can be grouped into two sets of equa-

tions [1]; the rst is the old 1/2 bps equations that produce purely magnetic monopoles, and the

second solves for the unbroken global gauge modes in this magnetic background. the solution of

the second bps equation is guaranteed and determines electric charges carried by monopoles of

the rst bps equation. thus, the 1/4 bps dyons are constructed by dressing 1/2 bps monopoles

electrically, where the amount of the relative electric charge depends on the monopole moduli

parameters. a crucial consequence is that the moduli space of monopoles also parameterizes the

classical 1/4 bps dyons but with a twist that some of the parameters characterizes electric charges.

these observations tell us that there are two dierent ways of constructing 1/4 bps cong-

urations. the rst is to obtain an exact eld theoretic classical solution. the energy of such a

conguration would saturate the classical bps bound exactly. on the other hand, since 1/4 bps

dyons are all dressed versions of purely magnetic monopoles, one also should be able to nd them

as excited charged congurations on the moduli space dynamics. they should also saturate a bps

bound of the low energy eective dynamics. in the limit where the moduli space approximation

is good, one then identies these two bps bounds, which should constrain the unknown potential

term. as a matter of fact, this procedure turns out to be enough to x the potential completely.

we will rst consider the interaction of two distinct dyons in the su(3) case. we nd the

exact form of the potential, using the idea outlined above. furthermore, the resulting hamiltonian

of the low energy dynamics is shown to have a bps bound. as a consistency check, we show that

the congurations that saturate this low energy bps bound describe the identical physics as the

eld theoretic 1/4 bps congurations. we also show that the 1/r piece of the potential at large

separation is consistent with the results from the study of the interaction of two point-like dyons

in large separation.

we then generalize this discussion to any combination of magnetic monopoles in arbitrary

gauge group. the form of the potential will turn out to be half the norm of of certain triholomorphic

killing vector eld on the moduli space. here a recent work by d. tong [9] plays a crucial role. this

way, the eective lagrangian is again determined by the geometry of the moduli space alone. this

particular form of potential is known to admit supersymmetric extension, which we also explore.

the plan of the paper is as follows. in sec.2, we review briey the 1/4 bps conguration

of two distinct dyons in su(3) gauge theory and the moduli space metric of these dyons in the

2

1/2 bps limit. in sec.3, we obtain the exact potential for the simplest case of su (3) when the

deviation from the 1/2 bps case is small, that is, when the d3 branes are almost on a straight

line. we show that the bps congurations of the low energy dynamics are identical to the bps

conguration of the eld theoretic ones. in sec.4, we generalize this result to arbitrary monopole

congurations in arbitrary gauge group with more emphasis on the geometrical character of the

low energy eective action. the underlying supersymmetric lagrangian and supercharge, as well

as the bps conditions, are found in sec. 5. in sec. 6 we conclude with some remarks.

2 two distinct monopoles in the su(3) gauge theory

the su(3) gauge group appears in the low energy dynamics of three parallel d3 branes. (see ref. [1]

for details.) the positions of d3 branes on a plane of the six-dimensional transverse direction are

dictated by the expectation values of two higgs elds:

b  () = diag(h1, h2, h3),
a  () =  diag(h1, h2, h3) +  diag(2,1  2, 1),

(1)

(2)

where h1 < h2 < h3, h1 + h2 + h3 = 0 and 1 = h2  h1, 2 = h3  h2. (here the string tension is
multiplied to the positions of d3 branes so that they acquire the mass dimension.) two higgs eld
expectation values are the coordinates of d3 branes along two orthogonal directions b = (1, 0) and

a = (0, 1). the relative position vector of the second d3 brane with respect to the rst d3 brane

on the plane is

~r1 = (1, 1  (1 + 22)),

while the relative position of the third d3 brane with respect to the second d3 brane is

~r2 = (2, 2 + (21 + 2)).

(3)

(4)

two simple roots  and  of the su (3) group are chosen in accordance with the convention
2 diag(0,1, 1), the masses

2 diag(1, 1, 0) and   h = 1

2 = 2 = 1,    = 1/2. with   h = 1
of isolated  and  monopoles are

m1 = g| ~r1|,
m2 = g| ~r2|,

(5)

(6)

respectively, where g = 4 is the charge of magnetic monopole with e = 1 assumed for convenience.

notice that when  and  are very small,

m1 = g1 +

g
21

(1  (1 + 22))2,

(7)

3

m2 = g2 +

g
22

(2 + (21 + 2))2.

(8)

there is a third monopole corresponding to the third positive root  +  and its mass is
m3 = g| ~r1 + ~r2|. in contrast to the case when the higgs vacuum values are aligned, generically
there is no distinction between fundamental or composite monopoles. (for example, consider the

case where three d3 branes lie on the corners of an equitriangle.) however, when the higgs vacuum

values are almost aligned as in the case we study, we can still distinguish between fundamental

and composite monopoles. thus,  and  monopoles are fundamental and  +  monopoles are

composite.

the dyonic conguration we consider is made of one  and one  monopoles, with electric

charges q1 and q2, respectively. thus the asymptotic forms of the higgs elds are

b   = b  () 
a   = a  () 

1

4r

g( + )  h,
(q1 + q2)  h.

for the given asymptotic (9), the solution of the rst bps equation

bi = dib  

(9)

(10)

(11)

is uniquely characterized by the relative distance, l, between two monopoles. once the rst bps

solution is found, the solution of the second bps equation

is found to be unique for a given asymptotic (10). from this solution, we can read electric charges

i a    [b  , [b  , a  ]] = 0
d2

(12)

where

q1 = g( + p1),

q2 = g( + p2),

p1 =

p2 =

(13)

(14)

(15)

(16)

as discussed in the introduction, one of the interesting things about these bps solutions is

that we may treat the 1/4 bps congurations as if they are made of 1/2 bps monopoles with

some electric dress. the rst bps equation can be regarded as the 1/2 bps equation. its solution

4

describes a collection of 1/2 bps monopoles and is characterized uniquely by the moduli space

coordinates. here the constituent monopoles carry mass characterized by the higgs asymptotic
value b  (). then we solve the second bps equation, which is identical to the gauge zero
mode equation of the rst bps equation. the solutions of the second bps equation is determined

uniquely by the moduli parameters of the solution of the rst bps equation and by the value
a  (). one of the key point of this paper is to take this view further and to regard the low
energy dynamics of 1/4 bps dyons as that of 1/2 bps monopoles described by the rst bps

equation.

thus, instead of m1 and m2, we regard g1 and g2 as the real mass of monopoles. we can

dene the total and relative charges with respect to the masses g1 and g2, that is,

1q1 + 2q2

qtot =

1 + 2

.

(17)

(18)

(19)

(20)

notice that the relative charge vanishes when l = 0 and tends to qc at l = . (when three
d3 branes lie on a line and so  = 0, the relative charge vanishes.) we further note that the mass

dierence, pi(mi  gi), may be written, in terms of charges, as

m1 + m2  g(1 + 2) =

1 + 2

2g

(qtot)2 +

2
g

(qc)2.

(21)

the dierence between mi and gi can be considered as a result of the interaction between

monopoles, which even includes a constant potential.

2.1 bps energy

in the bps energy bound, it is natural to introduce the two-dimensional magnetic and electric

charge vectors,

~qm = g( ~r1 + ~r2),
~qe = q1 ~r1 + q2 ~r2.

5

(22)

(23)

the central charge of the n=4 supersymmetric algebra, which gives the bps energy bound, is

z 2

e  2 ~qe  ~qm(cid:17) .
when the bp s equations are satised so that the bps energy bound is saturated, there is another
expression for the central term z. since a  ~qm = b  ~qe, the energy is

 = max(cid:16) ~q2

m + ~q2

(24)

z+ = b  ~qm + a  ~qe

= g(1 + 2) +

1 + 2

g

(qtot)2 +

4
g

q(l)qc,

(25)

which is exact. as b  ~qm = g(1 + 2) is just the sum of constituent monopole masses, we regard
the rest of the contribution, a  ~qe, to arise from the dynamics of monopoles.

the low energy dynamics means that the dynamical energy contribution to the rest mass is

small. from eqs. (17) and (18), we see that the low energy approximation may hold if

||,

|| << 1.

(26)

from eqs. (1) and (2), we see that three d3 branes are almost collinear, for the low energy

approximation to hold. the above condition also implies that the magnitude of qtot, q of 1/4 bps

congurations should be very small compared with the magnetic charge g. from our point of view,
a  ~qe in the central charge arises from the low energy dynamics of monopoles. as we will see, it
has the contributions from both kinetic and potential energies.

2.2 moduli space metric of 1/2 bps monopoles

when three d3 branes are collinear, the low energy dynamics of two monopoles can be described by

the moduli space or collective coordinate dynamics. there are four zero modes for each monopole,

three for its position and one for the u(1) phase. we call their positions and phases to be xi, i, i =

1, 2 for  and  monopoles, respectively. the exact nonrelativistic eective lagrangian has been

found to be a sum of the lagrangians for the center of mass and the relative motion [8]. as there

is no external force, the center of mass lagrangian is free one,

lcm =

g(1 + 2)

2

x2 +

g

2(1 + 2)

2,

(27)

where the center of mass position is x = (1x1 + 2x2)/(1 + 2) and the center of mass phase

is  = 1 + 2. the relative motion between them is more complicated and described by the

taub-nut metric,

lrel =

g

2  (1 +

1

2r

)r2 +

1

42(1 + 1

2r )

(  + w(r)  r)2! ,

(28)

6

where the relative position is r = x2  x1, the relative phase is  = 2(12  21)/(1 + 2), and
w(r) is the dirac potential such that   w(r) = r/r3. the range of  is [0, 4]. the relative
moduli space m0 is the taub-nut manifold with the metric given from the above lagrangian.
the eight-dimensional moduli space is then given by

m = r3 

s1  m0

z

,

where z is the identication map

(, ) = ( + 2,  +

42

1 + 2

).

(29)

(30)

one way of obtaining this moduli space metric is by exploring the long range interaction

between two dyons[10]. as for two dyons of charge (g, 1) and (g, 2), there are several inter-

actions between them. obvious ones are electric and magnetic coulomb potentials. besides, there

exists a potential due to higgs force between them.. in addition, when they move, there is a time

delay eect which appears in the form of lienard-wiechert potential. when they are put together,

we get the routhian obtained from the legendre transformation of phase variables to charges,

r =

g(1 + 2)

2

(cid:18) x2 

(t)2

g2 (cid:19) +

g
2

(1 +

1

2r

)(cid:18)r2 

4(r)2

g2 (cid:19) + rw(r)  r,

(31)

where the relation between t, r and 1 and 2 are given by similar equations as in eqs. (17)

and (18). we emphasize here that total charge t and relative charge r are conjugate momenta

without any xed value.

3 case of su (3)

to nd the potentials between two dyons in every relative separation, we explore rst the case
qtot = t = 0. suppose that the exact potential for the relative motion is urel(r), and so the
eective potential for two dyons is

ue (r) =

2

g (cid:18)1 +

1

2r(cid:19) (r)2 + urel(r)

(32)

the rst part of the eective potential comes from the charge kinetic energy. this eective potential

should have a minimum at r if r = q(r) for q(r) specied by eq. (18) and the energy at the

minimum should be identical to the bps energy (25) once we add the mass of monopoles. then

we realize that the potential energy is exactly one half of the excessive bps energy associated with

the relative charge. using this, we nd the piece of the potential,

urel(r) =

2
g

(qc)2
1 + 1
2r

7

=

2
g

(1 +

1

2r

)(q(r))2

(33)

where q(r) is to be understood as function of r given in eq. (18). however, we have not quite
found the potential u. we actually found only the piece that depends on the distance r. by
including the center of mass motion, it is not dicult to guess that the actual potential must be of

the form,

u(r) =

1 + 2

2g

q2
tot +

2
g

(qc)2
1 + 1
2r

(34)

this guess will be justied below momentarily.

as we have seen, this identication can be made for all possible classical dyons, which trans-
lates to all possible values of r. in eect, we have found the potential u throughout the moduli
space. in the next section, we will discover that this method is trivially generalized to arbitrary

congurations of monopoles and dyons in arbitrary gauge group, and that it produces a rather

special kind of potential, which, as one may expect, admits supersymmetric extension.

let us go back to the matter concerning total charge and its associated constant potential

energy.

if we minimize the eective potential (32), we get r to be q(r) = qc/(1 + 1

2r ).
however, we could not x t to be qtot in this way. hamiltons equations of motion imply that t

to be constant in time. thus, the naive equilibrium condition does not x the total electric charge,

even though it xes the relative charge. to understand this, let us now collect the full low energy

lagrangian for 1/4 bps dyons, which is the sum of the kinetic energies (27), (28) on the moduli

space and the potential energy (34)

llow = lcm + lrel  u(r).

(35)

in terms of the conjugate momenta, pt = g(1 + 2) x, p = g(1 + 1

2r )r + rw(r), t, and

r, the hamiltonian is

the hamiltonian can be expressed as follows:

(36)

(37)

where the new central term is

z =

1 + 2

g

qtott +

4
g

qcr.

(38)

the central term is linear in the conjugate momenta t and r. clearly there is a classical bps

bound on the mechanical energy

h  |z|,

(39)

which is saturated for any x and r when t = qtot and r = q(r) and x = r = 0. thus the
nonrelativistic bps conguration matches exactly the eld theoretic bps conguration. in this

case, the sum of the rest mass plus this bps energy is exactly the 1/4 bps energy bound (25).

thus our 1/4 bps eld conguration corresponds to not the lowest energy conguration, but a

bps saturated conguration of the nonrelativistic hamiltonian.

as an independent check of the above potential, let us consider the leading term in the large

distance. when three d3 branes are not collinear, two higgs elds are involved nontrivially and so

we expect an additional higgs interaction [11]. to see this, let us go back to the old derivation of

the higgs interaction. we put the resting  dyon at x1. the higgs eld far from this dyon is

i (x) = i () 

r1i

4|x  x1|

  hqg2 + 2

1,

(40)

in the unitary gauge. note that  i () = ~r1i . the  monopole at x = x2 would feel this higgs
eld as an eective mass

 me = qg2 + 2

1

,

  

4r (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

where r = |x2  x1|.

we expand the eective mass to order 1/r and to quadratic terms in 1 and 2 to get

 me = (cid:18)1 +

2
2

2g2(cid:19)m2

r1  r2(cid:18)1 +

2g2(cid:19).

(41)

(42)

if three d3 branes are collinear, r1 = r2 and we get the old result. when we include the velocity
dependent terms and electromagnetic forces and keep everything in quadratic order, we get the

previous routhian (31).

however, when they are not collinear, there is an additional 1/r correction to the old result.

as we assume that the deviation from the straight line is very small, or  << 1,

r1  r2 = cos   1 

2
2

.

9

(43)

from eqs. (3) and (4), one can show easily that

with qc in eq. (19). the small deviation obtained from eq. (42) is then

(44)

(45)

where we have included the additional constant terms from masses that are given explicitly in (21).

this is the additional attractive potential which exists since three d3 branes are not collinear. it

is a matter of simple algebra to check that the exact potential (34) we found above, do contain
this term to the leading r-dependent piece at large r. one may wonder about terms of order 1/r2.

these terms do not come out to be symmetric under the exchange of  and  monopoles and

depend on the monopole core size. it needs a further investigation, which we do not attempt here.

in the above derivation we have dropped terms of order (qc)2(i)2 and (qc)4. terms of
order (qc)2(i)2 can be regarded as the correction to the kinetic term which exists since d3 branes
are not collinear. corrections of such order is expected from the naive moduli space metric as there

will be additional term such as r d3xtr (a  )2. terms of order (qc)4 can be regarded as the

correction to the potential energy and is negligible compare with terms of order (qc)2.

the low energy approximation we found holds when the kinetic and potential energies are
much smaller than the rest mass. in terms of generic velocity v and the coecient, , of a (),
the low enegy approximation holds when

the order of the low energy lagrangian is then

v << 1,

the corrections we have neglected in the above expansion is then of order

4 generalization

the crucial ingredient of the preceding section came from a rather simple observation: we have

two dierent ways of determining the 1/4 bps dyon mass. the eld theoretic one gives an exact

10

expression, while the other is derived from approximate low energy dynamics on the moduli space

of monopoles. this is possible because the moduli space dynamics already incorporates various

internal excitations that induce relative electric charges. by comparing the two, one obtains an

approximate form of the inter-monopole potential that is arbitrarily accurate as the higgs expec-

tations become collinear. in this section, we will utilize this simple idea to x the bosonic part of

low energy eective lagrangian for all 1/2 bps and 1/4 bps states in maximally supersymmetric

yang-mills theory.

first consider a 1/2 bps multi-monopole conguration, when an arbitrary gauge group g is
broken to u (1)r by a single higgs eld expectation value hb  i = h in the root space. there are
always a set of simple roots a, a = 1, ...r such that h  a > 0. any bps magnetic monopole
conguration would have the magnetic charge

g = g(n11 + n22 + ... + nrr),

(49)

with nonnegative nas. without loss of generality, we assume that it is irreducible so that all na
are positive. in this case all monopoles are interacting with each other directly or indirectly and

are not divided into noninteracting subclusters.

each monopole of a type has mass ga = gh a and four zero modes. the total energy is
then gpa naa = g  h and the total number of zero mode is 4n = 4pa na [12]. the low energy

dynamics of this conguration can be described by the dynamics in the moduli space of dimension
4n with the metric ds2 = g dzdz . this moduli space is known to be hyperkahler and thus are
equipped with three covariantly constant complex structures [7, 14]. the low energy lagrangian is

then

l1 =

1
2

g z z .

the unbroken u (1)r symmetries act on the moduli space as translational isometries, and generate
cyclic u (1) coordinates a, whose conjugate momenta qa are conserved electric charges. we
divide the moduli space coordinates z into r as and remaining (4n  r) yis. up to gauge
transformations, the solution of the rst bps equation (11) is uniquely characterized by the values
of the coordinates yi. the lagrangian (50) can be rewritten as

l1 =

1
2

hij yi yj +

1
2

lab( a + wa

i yi)( b + wb

j yj).

(51)

i are functions of yi
due to the cyclic properties of as, the metric components hij, lab and wa
only. since the kinetic energy should be positive, the metric hij and lab are positive denite.
each u (1) generators are associated with the vector eld ka = /a = 
a/z, which is a
(triholomorphic) killing vector eld. finally, note that lab(y) = g k 

ak 
b.

11

denoting the conjugate momenta as

qa = lab( b + wb

j yj),

pi = hij yj + qawa
i ,

the electric charge of the whole conguration is expressed in terms of the qas as

q = q11 + q22 + ... + qrr.

the hamiltonian h1 = 1

2 g pp is

h1 =

hij(pi  qawa

i )(pj  qbwb

j ) +

(l1)abqaqb.

(52)

(53)

(54)

(55)

since l1 depends on the yis, this shows that electric charge excitations will typically induce a
long range potential. because of this, 1/4 bps congurations of dyons with relative charge cannot

be allowed if no other static forces are present, as would be the case if higgs expectations were all

aligned.

suppose that the other higgs eld a acquires an expectation value which is misaligned with
respect to hb  i. then there is an attractive static force between monopoles. if the misalignment
is small enough so that the static attractive potential is much smaller than the monopole mass

scale, we may incorporate this potential into the above moduli space dynamics. (the part of higgs
expectation a that is proportional to that of b is not associated with any static force. rather, its
eect on the bps conguration is to x the total charge to a certain value and to give an additional

contribution to the energy besides the energy carried by the charge. this can be understood as the

correction to the bare mass of magnetic monopoles.)

adding a potential to the hamiltonian and considering the static conguration with yi = 0,

we get an eective potential

ue =

1
2

qa(l1(y))abqb + u(y).

(56)

for 1/4 bps congurations, qa should be determined by the moduli parameters yi, or reversely,
given values of qa restrict the equilibrium positions yi.

on the other hand, an exact expression of the 1/4 bps conguration is known. the additional

energy due to the electric charge is given by a simple expression,

eq = a  ~qe = aa qa(y).

(57)

the second equality denes the projected higgs expectation values aa. the electric charge are

xed by the positions of magnetic monopoles, which we emphasize by introducing new notation

12

qa(y). a recent work by d. tong [9] brought some light on this quantity. he expressed qa(y) in

terms of quantities on moduli space and found

qa(y)  lab(y) ab.

(58)

this equation can be viewed in two equivalent ways. one is as a restriction on the possible
equilibrium positions yi when the electric charges are given. or equivalently, as an expression for
electric charges in terms of the equilibrium positions yi. either way, the excess energy due to the

electric charge excitation is

aa qa(y) = aalab(y) ab = qa(y) (l1(y))ab qb(y).

(59)

note that this happens to be twice the charge kinetic energy if we put qa = qa(y). again we
demand the potential u(y) to be identical to one half of eq, that is, when expressed as a function
of yi,

u(y) =

1
2

aalab(y) ab.

(60)

we need to pause here for a moment, and explain how it was possible that we obtained the potential
u by considering only the classical minimum energy congurations of ue . it may seem that we
made an extrapolation of some kind. however, it is not the case. we actually have derived the

exact potential, as we will explain below.

from ref. [1], we know that solutions to the rst bps equation (11) are characterized by
moduli parameters yis. that is, any given set of yi, a purely magnetic solution exists. then one

solves the second bps equation (12), which leads to 1/4 bps dyons whose conguration satises
the relation qa = qa(y) = lab(y)ab. in other words, there are 1/4 bps congurations for any
generic values of yis. therefore, while we identied the value of potential u for individual 1/4 bps
states, we can learn the values of u for all yi by considering all possible classical 1/4 bps dyons.

here, we need to make one nal consistency check. not only the value of the potential u(y)
at the minimum of the eective potential ue (y) should yield the right value, which led to the

above identication, but also it should have the minimum at the right value. in other words, we
must recover the central relationship qa = qa(y) = lab(y)ab, which is of eld theory origin, by
minimizing the low energy dynamics. the nal hamiltonian with the potential is

1
2

hij(y) yi yj +

(l1)ab(y)qaqb +

1
2

aalab(y)ab,

(61)

(62)

h =
where yi = hij(pj  qawa
1

h =

j ). as in the previous section, we can reexpress this as

hij(y) yi yj +

1
2

(l1)ab(y)(qa  qa(y))(qb  qb(y))  z,

13

where the central charge is

z = qa(y) (l1)ab(y) qb = aa qa.

(63)

the bps bound is saturated when yi = 0 and qa = qa(y), exactly as we have hoped for. this
completes the derivation of the potential u.

the eective lagrangian for the low energy is the sum of the usual kinetic term on the moduli

space and the potential u,

l =

(64)

(65)

note that, given the higgs expectation values, the potential is completely determined in terms of

geometry of the monopole moduli space. as showed by alvarez-gaume and freedman [13], and as

pointed out by d. tong [9] very recently, this form of potential is exactly what one needs to extend
the dynamics to a supersymmetric one. in particular, the triholomorphicity of a  k that follows
from gauge invariance, guarantees that the low energy dynamics will have 8 real supercharges. in

this sense the dynamics itself is 1/2 bps with respect to the yang-mills eld theory. the quantum

counterpart of the classical 1/4 bps dyons should break additional half of these remaining 8

supercharges, and is realized as nite energy bps states of this low energy theory itself. in the

next section we will explore this supersymmetric dynamics in some detail.

5 supersymmetry and bps bound

we begin with the n=4 supersymmetric quantum extension of the above eective action [13]. its

form is similar to the usual sigma model action but modied by a coupling to the triholomorphic
killing vector g  a  k. the supersymmetric lagrangian written with real fermions is

l =

1

2(cid:18)g z z + ig 0dt +
g gg  dg 5(cid:19),

1
6

r   

(66)

where  is a two-component anticommuting majorana spinor and 0 = 2, 5 = 3, and  = t 0.
the metric here is hyperkahler, endowed with three complex structures f (a)
(a = 1, 2, 3) that

satisfy

f (a)f (b) = ab + abcf (c),
df (a)

 = 0 ,

14

(67)

(68)

and the killing vector g is triholomorphic, i.e., its action preserves the three complex structures.

from now on, we will use f to denote any one of the three complex structures, unless noted

otherwise.

with vielbein ea

 and the spinors a = ea

 , we dene supercovariant momenta by

  p

(69)

where the ps are canonical momenta of coordinate zs, and a
 , b
canonical commutation relations are [z, p ] = i
real form are:

 and {a

which satisfy the following susy algebra:

{q, q} = {qf
{q, qf

} = 0

, qf

} = 2 h + 2i(05) z

(70)

(71)

(72)

(73)

similarly, supercharges associated with dierent complex structures f (a) anticommute. the hamil-
tonian h and the central charge z read

(74)

(75)

it is easily checked that the central charge z indeed commutes with all susy generators.

for spectrum analysis, susy generators in complex form are more useful. introducing  
1  i

2 ), and dening q  12

(q1  iq2), one nds

(

12

q =  + ig,
q =   ig,

which generates the following simple algebra:

{q, q} = {qf , qf } = 2h,
{q, q} = {qf , qf} = {q, q} = {qf , qf } = 2iz,
{q, qf} = {q, qf} = 0.

15

(76)

(77)

(78)

(79)

(80)

again, supercharges associated with dierent complex structures f (a) anticommute.

it is easy to read o the bps condition for quantum states that preserves half of supersym-

metries. depending on the sign of central charge, we nd

so that the given state may saturate the condition h = z. we can express this bps condition
in more geometrical fashion by transcribing the wavefunction to dierential forms on the moduli

(q  iq)|i = 0,

(81)

space [15]. note that

,

[i,  ] = 
[i,  ] = 
{, } = 
 .

,

furthermore, the wavefunction has the following general form,

1p(z)1  p|0i

1
|i = xp
p!
|0i = 0.

(82)

(83)

(84)

(85)

(86)

the coecients 1p are completely antisymmetric and may be regarded as those of a p-form.

in this language where we interpret  and  as a natural cobasis dz and a natural basis
z ,
one nds that the following replacement can be made:

i  d ,
g  ig ,

i  ,
iz  lg  dig + igd,

(87)

(88)

where ig denotes the natural contraction of the vector eld g with a dierential form. the bps

equation now becomes

 (id + ig)  =  i(id + ig)  

(89)

where  is the hodge dual operator. solving this rst order system, we should recover all 1/2 bps
and 1/4 bps states of the underlying yang-mills eld theory. work is currently in progress to solve

this equation in the simplest case of su (3) [16].

6 conclusion

we have found the low energy eective lagrangian of 1/2 bps monopoles in vacua of misaligned

higgs expectation values. this low energy eective theory produces 1/4 bps dyons as bps con-

gurations of the nonrelativitic hamiltonian. the kinetic term is given by the usual moduli space

16

metric of 1/2 bps monopoles, while the potential term is also determined by the same geometrical

data. its precise form is given by one half of the norm of certain killing vector eld, which allows

a supersymmetric extension.

there are several directions to go from here. our derivation relies heavily on the established

properties of 1/4 bps dyons and monopole moduli space. while there is little doubt that this is

a valid derivation, it may be worthwhile to rederive our exact result from a dierent perspective.

for instance, one may imagine deriving the exact bosonic potential from a point particle point of

view. another venue would be to nd the supersymmetric low eective energy lagrangian directly

from the eld theory, along the line of gauntlett and blum [14]. naturally, we expect to recover

the 1/4 bps dyon spectra as quantum bps states of this low energy dynamics. the actual form

of the wavefunction is currently under investigation for the minimal case of su (3) [16].

another interesting question concerns monopoles when the symmetry breaking is not maxi-
mal [17]. the gauge symmetry breaking is determined by both b  () and a  (). if there is
unbroken nonabelian gauge symmetry by b  (), some of magnetic monopoles become massless.
the moduli space acquires an enhanced isometry, corresponding to unbroken gauge groups. by
a  (), the unbroken gauge symmetry could remain unbroken or gets broken [18]. in the former
case, the massless monopole clouds screen the color magnetic charge of massive monopoles, and

the strength of static monopole-monopole force, say in the singlet channel, may be dierent from

naive expectation. such a deviation has been observed in the large n context quite recently [19].

it would be quite interesting to quantize massless monopole motion and nd the resulting quantum

eective potential between massive monopoles. however, we should also point out that it is still

unclear whether the moduli space dynamics is a valid approximation in the case of nonmaximal

symmetry breaking.
