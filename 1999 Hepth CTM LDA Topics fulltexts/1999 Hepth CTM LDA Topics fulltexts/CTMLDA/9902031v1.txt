in the leading log approximation and at large nc the interaction of two
abstract:
fermionic and one gluonic reggeons is described by an integrable system corresponding to
an open spin chain.

1 reggeons in gauge theories

in the regge limit, where the energy is large compared to the masses and momentum
transfers, the perturbative expansion of the scattering amplitudes is most conveniently
written in terms of the exchange of reggeons in the t-channel. the reggeons interact
with the scattering near mass shell quanta and with each other via eective vertices.
it is appropriate to mellin transform the energy dependence of the amplitudes and to
consider the resulting partial waves in the complex angular momentum (j) plane. the
reggeons correspond to poles in j moving with the tranferred momentum [1]. the scat-
tering amplitude of gauge-group singlet particles is represented as a convolution of two
impact factors and the reggeon green function. the impact factors describe the coupling
of the in-and outgoing (in forward and backward directions, respectively) particles to the
exchanged reggeons. our discussion is restricted to the reggeon green function describing
the exchange of the interacting reggeons.

the high-energy eective action [2] describes the interaction of the scattering partons
and the reggeons. this action is derived from the underlying action by integrating over
modes of the elds, that appear neither in the scattering nor in the exchanged quanta.
on the tree level the reggeons are the modes of the original elds corresponding to the
exchange in the regge kinematics. due to loop corrections the corresponding pole in
the j-plane moves with the momentum transferred by the reggeon. actually, the trajec-
tory functions and the bare reggeon interactions have to be regularized to avoid infrared

divergences, which cancel however in the scattering amplitudes of gauge group singlet
objects.

we disregard the case of changing number of reggeons during the exchange. the depen-
dence on the longitudinal (time and direction of the collision axis) dimensions is trivial.
at large nc also the gaue group part of the inteaction becomes trivial. the interaction is
pairwise. the interaction of two reggeons at impact parameters (tranverse positions) x1
and x2 (paramentrized as complex numbers) is described by hamitonian operators, which
can be written as a sum of two terms, the rst involving only the holomorphic coordinates
and derivatives and the second involving only the anti-holomorphic ones. the lowest en-
ergy eigenvalues are directly related to the right-most regge singularities generated by the
(two- or multi-) reggeon exchange. the reggeons are characterized by conformal weights
(, ) which are (0,0) for gluonic reggeons and ( 1
2) for fermions, depending
on helicity [3, 4]. we restrict the discussion to the holomorphic part keeping in mind
the condition of single-valuedness of the reggeon green function in the transverse plane.
we denote the holomorphic part of the hamiltonian by h 1,2
, with 1, 2 being the
holomorphic weights of the two reggeons and the lower indices being the short-hand no-
tation for the dependence on the holomorphic coordinates x1, x2 and derivatives 1, 2,
(x12 = x1  x2).

it is not dicult to check that the hamiltonian is symmetric, i.e. commutes with m a

writing the argument as c = m(1  m) the functions (c) can be expressed in terms of
the logarithmic derivative of the  function

(c) = 2(1)  (m + )  (1  m + ).

(5)

the conformal symmetry can be established also by looking more closely at the two forms
given in (1) and observing that the formal transposition of these operators h t can be
obtained from h by similarity transformations. for example, in the case of 1 = 1
2 , 2 = 0
we have

(h ( 1

2 = p12x1

12 h ( 1

(6)

p12 permutes the points 1 and 2. by comparison we obtain that there is an operator
commuting with h ( 1

2 ,0):

[a12, h

] = 0, a12 = p12x122.

this result is directly related to conformal symmetry, because a12 is essentially the square

2 three-reggeon exchange

the symmetry which has been exhibited in the representation (4) allows to obtain easily
the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the two-reggeon system. the two-reggeon green
function can be decomposed into these eigenfunctions. for the eigenvalues we have just
to substitute in (4) c = m(1  m), m = 1
2 + n + i , n integer and  real. the contribution
of multi-reggeon exchange is physically relevant not only as unitarity correction to the
two-reggeon exchange. the quantum numbers in some channels cannot be transferred
by just two gluons or by quark - antiquark. much work has been done for the case of
multiple exchange of gluonic reggeons. the problem has been related to integrable spin
chains [5, 6]. due to the large nc approximation one is led to a closed chain with nearest
neighbour interactions.
in the case of three gluonic reggeons (odderon channel) after
serious eorts the leading eigenvalue has been calculated [7, 8].

we are studying the reggeon exchange with fermions included. as the rst non-trivial
case we have considered the quark - antiquark - gluon exchange.
if the fermions have
opposite helicities the holomorphic part corresponds to a one-dimensional three-body
system with the conformal weights 1 = 1
2 , 2 = 3 = 0. we show that the system
is integrable by constructing an additional operator, besides of the conformal generators
m a

1 + m a

2 + m a

.

(8)

for the fermions in the fundamental representation the large nc approximation results
in an open chain with nearest neighbour interaction and with the fermions at the end
points. including adjoint fermions we would encounter also closed inhomogeneous chains,
which is a case essential dierent from the one considered.

we know two ways of constructing the additional integral of motion. the rst one is a
simple generalization of the transposition argument presented above. indeed we observe

h t

123 = 23 h123 (23)1 = p123x1

23 x1

12 h123 x23x12p123.

(9)

p123 permutes the points 1, 2, 3 into 3, 2, 1. therefore we have the commuting operator
a123 :

[a123, h123] = 0, a123 = p123 x12x2323.

(10)

3 open spin chain

in the case of only gluons the multi-reggeon system is described by a closed quantum
spin chain with the non-compact sl(2) representations of weight  = 0 at each site. we
associate a lax matrix to each site: li() = i (2) + 0m 0
i . it obeys
the usual yang - baxter - relation with the 4  4 r-matrix r12() = i (4) + p12. this
relation generalizes to products qn
i=1 li( + i) = t (). it follows that the trace tr t ()
generates a complete set of commuting operators, which are just the ones needed for the
integrable closed homogeneous chain [5, 6].

in the case of open chains the boundaries impose additional conditions on the integrable

interaction [9]

r12(1  2) t (1)  i (2) r12(1 + 2) i (2)  t (2) =
t (2)  i (2) r12(1 + 2) i (2)  t (1) r12(1  2).

(11)

and another condition related to this one by crossing. given a matrix k obeying (11)
when inserted for t and another matrix k+ obeying the crossing relation one nds that
t () = t ()kt 1() obeys (11) too, provided t () obeys the ordinary yang - baxter
- relation. furthermore, it follows that the trace tr( t ()k+) generates mutually com-
muting operators. whereas the generating function tr t () for the closed chain can be
visualized by drawing the closed chain and associating the lax matrices with each site,
the generating function tr (t ()kt 1()k+) is visualized as the closed chain built
from the considered open chain together with its mirror image and with the matrices k
standing for the mirror.

we obtain the integrals of motion for our three-reggeon problem for the simple choice

k = i (2). we have

t () = l

(12)

the trace tr(t ()t 1()), e.g. with 1 = 2 = 3 = 1
2, decomposes into the operators
a2
123 (10), c123 = c12 + c23 + c31 and c23 (3) with linear independent functions of 
as coecients. in this way we have checked that the considered three-reggeon system is
properly described by an integrable open spin chain. now the generalization to multi-
reggeon systems with quark and antiquark and an arbitrary number of gluonic reggeons
is straightforward.
