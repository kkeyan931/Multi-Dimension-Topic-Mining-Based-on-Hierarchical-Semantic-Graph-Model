abstract

it is well known that the toroidal dimensional reduction of supergravities gives rise

in three dimensions to theories whose bosonic sectors are described purely in terms of

scalar degrees of freedom, which parameterise sigma-model coset spaces. for example, the

reduction of eleven-dimensional supergravity gives rise to an e8/so(16) coset lagrangian.

in this paper, we dispense with the restrictions of supersymmetry, and study all the three-

dimensional scalar sigma models g/h where g is a maximally-non-compact simple group,

with h its maximal compact subgroup, and nd the highest dimensions from which they can

be obtained by kaluza-klein reduction. a magic triangle emerges with a duality between

rank and dimension.

interesting also are the cases of hermitean symmetric spaces and

quaternionic spaces.

introduction

it is well known that the dimensional reduction of eleven-dimensional supergravity [1] to

d = 3 gives rise to a scalar coset theory with an e8(+8) global symmetry. conversely, we

may say that the oxidation endpoint of the three-dimensional e8(+8) scalar coset is the

bosonic sector of d = 11 supergravity. in [2], a classication of three-dimensional scalar

cosets associated with the various groups that arise from the dimensional reduction of d = 4

gravity coupled to matter systems was given. in many cases, these four-dimensional theo-

ries can themselves be obtained from the dimensional reduction of yet higher dimensional

theories of matter coupled to gravity.

in most of this paper, we shall study the oxida-

tion endpoints (also called group disintegration endpoints) of the three-dimensional scalar

cosets given in [2]. by the oxidation endpoint of a three-dimensional scalar coset, we mean

the (bosonic) theory in the highest possible dimension dmax whose toroidal dimensional re-

duction gives back precisely the three-dimensional scalar coset. we shall concentrate on

the examples where the numerator group of the three-dimensional scalar coset is maximally

non-compact. it turns out that these cases are simpler and exhibit more regularity than

the cases of non-maximally non-compact symmetry groups rst studied systematically for

four dimensional supergravities in [4].

a particular example, namely the sl(n, ir)/o(n) scalar coset, was studied in [3]. it was

shown that it can be obtained from the dimensional reduction of pure gravity in d = 2 + n

dimensions. this in fact provides a useful clue in more general cases as to what is the

oxidation endpoint of a given three-dimensional scalar coset. namely, if the global symmetry

group of a three-dimensional scalar coset contains a subgroup sl(n, ir), then one might

expect that the oxidation endpoint of the coset would be in dmax = n + 2 dimensions.

we nd that this rule works for all the maximally non-compact simple or semi-simple

groups, with the exception of ck. the reason for this can be claried by recalling that

the reduction to two dimensions leads to a set of equations invariant under the kac-moody

ane symmetry. this symmetry extends the three-dimensional nite dimensional symmetry

group in such a way that the ane dynkin diagram reveals the subgroup sl(n, ir) by direct

inspection (for instance the (freudenthal-) subgroup sl(9, ir) of e8). one can then check

that ck cannot be oxidised beyond 4 dimensions. the point is that the ane vertex of

the extended diagram should be the endpoint of this sl(n, ir) (see, for instance, [4]). let

us also point out that the toroidal dimensional reduction of any d-dimensional generally-
covariant theory to d = 3 will automatically admit a gl(d3, ir) rigid internal symmetry.
part of the magic here is that sl(d  2, ir) invariance holds, as one can check in a case by

2

case analysis.

having found the oxidation endpoints for the various three-dimensional scalar cosets, one

can then look also at the global symmetry groups that result when these higher-dimensional

theories are reduced to various intermediate dimensions 3 < d < dmax. each oxidation

endpoint theory gives rise to a particular sequence of such intermediate theories, which we

may label by the associated global symmetry group in d = 3. the most well-known example

is thus the e8 sequence, which comes from the dimensional reduction of dmax = 11
supergravity, giving e11d in d dimensions. note that, unlike the situation discussed in
[2, 5, 6], we shall principally be concerned with the case where the dimensional reduction

is on a purely spacelike torus. the only dierence, from the group-theoretic point of view,

is that the denominator groups h for the scalar cosets g/h will be compact rather than

non-compact.

2 simply-laced scalar coset sequences

2.1 an sequences

the maximally non-compact form of an is sl(n + 1, ir). as mentioned in the introduction,

the associated three-dimensional scalar cosets sl(n + 1, ir)/o(n + 1) can be obtained by

the dimensional reduction of pure gravity in dmax = n + 3 dimensions [3].

if we perform the dimensional reduction to d = 3 of the pure einstein-hilbert la-

grangian in dmax = n + 3, we obtain

l3 = r 1l  1

(2.1)

after dualising the potentials ai

where f i

(the bar over the potential indicates the extended set.) dening also a

(2.4)

thus the usual proof of the existence of the sl(n, ir) symmetry now establishes that we

have an sl(n + 1, ir) symmetry in this three-dimensional case (see, for example, [3]).

the dilaton vectors ~bij and ~bi form the positive roots of sl(n + 1, ir), and it is easily
seen that ~b1 and ~bi,i+1 (with 1  i  n 1) are the simple roots. thus we have the dynkin
diagram [3]

~bn1,n
(cid:13)

diagram 1: in d = 3, ~b1 and ~bi,i+1 generate the sl(n + 1, ir) dynkin diagram.
vertices appear one by one from the right, starting in dimension 1 + n, except for the

left-most one, which is a disconnected ir from dimensions 2 + n down to 3, where it

connects as an sl(2, ir) subgroup.

if the pure gravity theory in dmax = n + 3 dimensions is reduced to intermediate
dimensions d = dmax  m > 3 on an m-torus, then the global symmetry group will be
gl(m, ir).

2.2 dn sequences

the maximally non-compact form of dn is o(n, n). these groups are familiar as the t-

duality symmetry groups of string theory, dimensionally reduced on a torus. for example,
if one reduces the ns-ns sector of ten-dimensional type ii string to d  5 on t 10d, one
obtains an o(10  d, 10  d)  ir global symmetry. there are symmetry enhancements in
d = 4 and d = 3, leading to o(6, 6)  sl(2, ir), and o(8, 8) respectively [8, 9, 10]. more
generally, we can consider the lagrangian

ld = r 1l  1

2d  d  1

2 ea f(3)  f(3)

(2.5)

in an arbitrary dimension dmax, where the constant a is given by a2 = 8/(dmax  2). upon
toroidal reduction to d = 3, we obtain

note that here ~ denotes the set of dilatons (1, 2, . . . , dmax3) introduced in appendix
a, augmented by  as a zeroth component; ~ = (, 1, 2, . . . , dmax3). similarly, the
various dilaton vectors are those dened in appendix a, augmented by a rst component

that is equal to the constant a in the case of ~ai and ~aij, and is equal to zero in the case of
~bi and ~bij.

after dualising the 1-form potentials ai

(1) and a(1)i to axions i and i respectively, the

three-dimensional lagrangian (2.6) can written as the purely scalar lagrangian

l3 = r 1l  1

j dj .

(2.7)

(2.8)

(see appendix a for details of how the dualisations work.)

it is now straightforward to see that if we take dmax = n + 2, then the three-dimensional
lagrangian (2.7) has a dn global symmetry, where (~bij,~bi,~aij,~ai) are its positive roots,
with the simple roots being ~a12, ~bi,i+1 (i  n  1) and ~an. thus we have the dynkin
diagram

~a12

diagram 2: the dilaton vectors ~a12, ~bi,i+1 and ~an generate the dn dynkin diagram.
the vertices appear one by one, starting from the extremities of the horizontal line

which are both ir factors in dimension n + 1. the sl(2, ir) on the left appears in

dimension n, the short leg being still ir, and the inner roots appear from the left.

the diagram becomes irreducible in dimension 3.

5

in other words, we have shown that a three-dimensional scalar coset lagrangian with
g/h = o(n, n)/(o(n)  o(n)) can be dimensionally oxidised to the endpoint dimension
dmax = n + 2, where it is described by the lagrangian (2.5).

the same dynkin diagram can be used in order to determine the global symmetry

groups of the intermediate steps of oxidation of the three-dimensional lagrangian (2.7),

by removing from the right those vertices that are associated with elds that exist only in
dimensions lower than the dimension under consideration. the vertex ~an itself must be
handled carefully, since it is associated with a dualised eld. in four dimensions it should be
replaced by ~a, whilst it corresponds in dimensions greater than four to the top dimension
(dilaton) scalar eld. consequently, the global symmetry group of the theory obtained by
oxidising the dn-symmetric three-dimensional scalar lagrangian to d  dmax = n + 2
dimensions is dm  ir, where m = dmax  d, if d  5, while it is dn2  sl(2, ir)
if d = 4. (the additional ir factor in d  5 is descended from the ir symmetry of the
(n+2)-dimensional lagrangian (2.5); similarly, the kalb-ramond eld yields a full sl(2, ir)
subgroup connected to the left part of the diagram from dimension n 1 downwards.) the
connection of the kr degrees of freedom to the second node on the left is due to the fact

that it is a second-rank antisymmetric tensor. we shall see shortly that a third-rank rr

form leads to the en series for a similar reason.

2.3 en sequences

2.3.1 e8 sequence

this is the well-known sequence of d-dimensional scalar coset theories obtained by the
dimensional reduction of eleven-dimensional supergravity on the (d  11)-torus [11], whose
bosonic sector is given by

l11 = r 1l  1

2f(4)  f(4)  1

6 da(3)  da(3)  a(3) .

(2.9)

after dualising all higher-degree elds where necessary, the scalar sector of the d-dimensional
theory has e11d, in its maximally non-compact form, as its global symmetry group. a
discussion of these symmetries, in the language we are using in this paper, may be found in
[7]. the scalar elds in d dimensions are the dilatons ~, the axions ai
(0)j coming from the
metric and a(0)ijk coming from the eleven-dimensional 3-form a(3), together with further
axions in d  5 coming from the dualisation of certain higher-degree gauge elds. the
simple-root vectors are ~bi,i+1 and ~a123 (associated with the dilaton vectors ~bij and ~aijk for
ai

(0)j and a(0)ijk respectively). these give the dynkin diagrams depicted in diagram 3:

~a123

diagram 3: the dilaton vectors ~bi,i+1 and ~a123 generate the e8 dynkin diagram.
the short leg starts as ir in d = 10, becomes sl(2, ir) in d = 8, and connects below

that.

in a given dimension d, only those vertices with index values i  11 d survive, giving
rise to the dynkin diagram for e11d. (we adopt the standard convention where e5  d5,
e4  a4, e3  a2  a1, e2  gl(2, ir) and e1  ir.)

2.3.2 e7 sequence of scalar cosets

to obtain this sequence, we consider a consistent (albeit non-supersymmetric) truncation of

d = 9 maximal supergravity, to the theory whose bosonic sector comprises just the metric,
a dilaton, a vector potential and a 3-form potential.1 the lagrangian is

l9 = r 1l 1

2dd 1
2 e

2
7

 f(4)f(4) 1

2 e 4

7

 f(2)f(2) 1

2 da(3)da(3)a(1) . (2.10)

to be precise, the potential a(1), with eld strength f(2) = da(1), is the potential a(1)12

coming from a(3) after two steps of toroidal reduction, in the notation of [12, 7]. the

dilaton  is the linear combination of the two dilatons of d = 9 maximal supergravity that

is parallel to ~a (and hence also parallel to ~a12) in the notation of [12, 7]. (in other words,
 = 1
2

7 ~a12  ~.) however, having noted the d = 11 origin of the truncated

7 ~a  ~ =  1

4

theory, we shall now use the more convenient notation where we simply denote the vector

potential by a(1). further dimensional reductions will use a notation in the spirit of [12, 7],

but where the rst reduction step, with index i = 1, is from d = 9 to d = 8, and so on.

note that in obtaining the lagrangian (2.10) the largest possible number of elds has

been consistently truncated out, while still retaining the 3-form potential a(3). in particular,

1by a consistent truncation, we mean that all the equations of motion, including those of the elds

that are set to zero, are satised.

7

the f f a term in (2.10) makes it impossible to make a further truncation of the vector

potential a(1) while keeping a(3). another way of understanding the consistency of the

truncation is by looking at maximal d = 9 supergravity from the point of view of type

iib supergravity. the truncation to (2.10) is then the one that results from keeping just

the metric and the self-dual 5-form in d = 10. in fact, this ten-dimensional theory can

also be viewed as a natural oxidation endpoint for the e7 sequence of theories that we are

considering in this subsection. the truncation can easily be seen to be consistent, because

all the singlet elds of the sl(2, r) global symmetry in d = 9 (or d = 10 type iib) are
retained. note that sl(8, ir) is indeed a subgroup of e7, and so the sl(d  2, ir) rule
mentioned in the introduction is satised.

performing the dimensional reduction, using a notation analogous to that in [12, 7], we

obtain the d-dimensional lagrangian

here, the notation for the dilatons is that ~ = (, 1, 2, . . . , 9d).

let us now focus on the reduction to d = 3, and study the global symmetry group.

there are 7 dilatons ~; 20 + 6 + 15 = 41 axions a(0)ijk, a(0)i and ai
a(1) and the metric; and 15 + 1 + 6 = 22 vectors a(1)ij, a(1) and ai
three sources). we can dualise the vectors to give further axions, whose dilaton vectors will
be the negatives of those for the vector potentials, namely ~aij, ~c and ~bi. in total, we
therefore now have 7 dilatons and 63 axions. this is precisely the dimension of the coset

(0)j coming from a(3),
(1) (coming from the same

e7/su (8). as usual, the global symmetry is best understood by noting that the dilaton

vectors for the axions of the fully-dualised three-dimensional theory form the positive roots
of e7. this is easily seen by observing that the dilaton vectors ~bi,i+1 (1  i  5), ~a123 and
~c1 can be taken as the simple roots, and all the other dilaton vectors can then be written

as linear combinations of these with non-negative integer coecients. from the dening

properties of the dilaton vectors, we see that these simple roots give the e7 dynkin diagram:

~a123

diagram 4: the dilaton vectors ~bi,i+1, ~c1 and ~a123 generate the e7 dynkin diagram.
the roots add from left to right as one descends through the dimensions. the short

leg starts as ir in dimension 9, and becomes sl(2, ir) in dimension 6.

the full system of e7 positive roots is then generated by

~bij = ~bik + ~bkj ,

~cj = ~bij + ~ci ,

 ~akj = ~bik + ~aij , etc.

~ajk = ~bi + ~aijk , etc.
~a12 = 2~b12 + 3~b23 + 3~b34 + 2~b45 + ~b56 + ~a123 + ~c1 ,
~c = ~b12 + 2~b23 + 3~b34 + 2~b45 + ~b56 + 2~a123 .

(2.12)

it is easy to verify that these summation rules imply that all the dilaton vectors for the

axions can be expressed as linear combinations of the simple-root dilaton vectors, with non-

negative integer coecients. the rst four lines are trivial, implying that the elds carrying

i, j, . . . indices fall into representations under sl(6, ir), which originates from the general-

coordinate transformations of the internal 6-torus. the last two lines give the non-trivial

extension from sl(6, ir) to e7.

in an intermediate dimension 3 < d < dmax = 10, we can read o the global symmetry

groups by removing the dots in the dynkin diagram 3 whose indices lie outside the range 1
to 9  d. thus the oxidation of the e7-symmetric three-dimensional scalar lagrangian to
d dimensions gives theories with the following global symmetry groups:

su (8)

table 1: scalar cosets for the e7 sequence

note that in d  7, the global symmetry is simply the gl(9 d, ir) general coordinate
symmetry of the internal (9  d)-torus. in d  6, the global symmetry contains a part
that lies outside the general coordinate transformations. it should be emphasised that in all

the dimensions, the global symmetries given in table 1 arise when all elds are dualised if

this results in a reduction of their degrees. again the short leg connects at the appropriate

place for a (self-dual) 4-form potential.

2.3.3 e6 sequence of scalar cosets

the oxidation endpoint of the e6 sequence is d = 8, and again the associated theory is the

smallest one obtainable as a consistent truncation of maximal supergravity in which the

3-form potential is retained. it comprises the metric, a dilaton and an axion, together with

the 3-form potential. the eight-dimensional lagrangian is given by

l8 = r1l  1

2d  d  1

2 e2 d  d  1

2 e f(4)  f(4) +  da(3)  da(3) ,

(2.13)

where f(4) = da(3). the theory has a global sl(2, ir) symmetry at the level of its equations
of motion, with f(4) and its dual ef(4) forming a doublet. the details of the lagrangians
in d dimensions follow straightforwardly from the discussion in appendix a.

as in the previous case, let us now focus on the reduction to d = 3, and study the

global symmetry group. there are 6 dilatons ~; 10 + 10 + 1 = 21 axions a(0)ijk, ai
and 10 + 5 = 15 vectors a(1)ij and ai
whose dilaton vectors will be the negatives of those for the vector potentials. in total, we

(0)j and ;
(1). we can dualise the vectors to give further axions,

therefore now have 6 dilatons and 36 axions, which is precisely the dimension of the coset

e6/usp(8).

10

we now nd that the dilaton vectors ~bi,i+1 (1  i  4), ~a123 and ~c can be taken as the
simple roots, and all the other dilaton vectors can then be written as linear combinations

of these with non-negative integer coecients. here, we are using ~c to denote the dilaton

vector for the axion . from the dening properties of the dilaton vectors, we see that these

simple roots give the e6 dynkin diagram:

the roots add from left to right as one descends through the dimensions. in d = 5,

a root combines with the ir factor from 7 dimensions to form a second sl(3, ir)

containing the top-dimension scalars; the group becomes simple below that.

we may again also read o the global symmetry groups in all intermediate dimensions

3 < d < dmax = 8, by making the appropriate truncations of the dynkin diagram. thus

one notes again the ehlers-type phenomenon of a build-up from a trivial ir symmetry

to give a simple duality group in lower dimensions. here, it is sl(3, ir) in dimension 5.

2.3.4 en (n  5) sequences of scalar cosets
the above discussion can be extended to the set of cases where we begin in d  7 with
a maximal consistent truncation of the corresponding maximal supergravity, in which just

the metric, a dilaton and a 3-form potential are retained. (in d = 4, the 3-form is non-

dynamical, and will be set to zero.) in all these cases, the lagrangian can be expressed

as

ld = r 1l  1

2d  d  1

2 ea f(4)  f(4) ,

(2.14)

where a2 = 2(11d)
. after dimensional reduction to d = 3 and dualisation of the vectors,
the scalar coset has the global symmetry ed2, where d  7 is understood here to be the
oxidation endpoint dimension dmax. to be more precise, we have

d2

d = 3 scalar coset

o(5, 5)/(o(5)  o(5))

dmax = 6

dmax = 5

dmax = 4

dmax = 3

for the global symmetries of the three-dimensional theories coming from the reductions of

(2.14) in the indicated endpoint dimensions.

these results can be understood very simply as follows. in the case dmax = 7, the 3-form

potential can be dualised to a 2-form, and hence the lagrangian is like the low-energy ef-

fective theory for a seven-dimensional bosonic string. this means that the global symmetry

group will be at least the usual o(n, n) t-duality group when the theory is compactied

on an n-torus. when n = 3, the resulting four-dimensional theory will actually have an
o(3, 3)  sl(2, ir) symmetry, where the extra sl(2, ir) factor is the electric/magnetic s-
duality [13]. when n = 4, the three-dimensional theory has o(5, 5) rather than simply

o(4, 4) as its global symmetry.

for the e4 sequence, which starts in dmax = 6, the 3-form potential is dual to a vector,

and in fact the dualised theory can be obtained by dimensional reduction from pure gravity

in d = 7. thus the global symmetry of the three-dimensional theory will be the same as
that for pure gravity reduced from seven dimensions, namely sl(5, ir)  e4. again, this

12

is in accordance with the sl(d  2, ir) rule mentioned in the introduction.

for the e3 sequence, starting in dmax = 5, the 3-form is dual to an axion, and hence the

ve-dimensional theory comprises the metric and a dilaton-axion system with an sl(2, ir)

symmetry. upon reduction to three dimensions, the gravity sector contributes an sl(3, ir)
factor, giving sl(3, ir)  sl(2, ir)  e3 in total.

for the e2 sequence, beginning in dmax = 4, we have just pure gravity plus a dilaton.
the global symmetry of the reduced three-dimensional theory is therefore gl(2, ir)  e2,
where the sl(2, ir) factor is the usual one from the reduction of gravity to d = 3, and the

extra ir factor is from the shift symmetry of the four-dimensional dilaton.

finally, for the e1  ir sequence, we simply have gravity plus a scalar in d = 3, and

so no oxidation is possible.

2.3.5 summary

it is well known that the dimensional reduction of eleven-dimensional supergravity to d = 3

gives rise to a scalar coset theory with an e8 global symmetry. in other words, the oxidation

endpoint of the three-dimensional e8/so(16) scalar coset is d = 11 supergravity. in this

section we studied the oxidation endpoints of the three-dimensional scalar cosets whose
global symmetry groups are the en subgroups of e8, with 2  n  8. we showed that in
the oxidation endpoint dimension for the subgroup en is generically given by dmax = n + 2.

in all cases, the endpoint theory includes the metric, a dilaton, and a 3-form potential, and
in dmax  7 there are no additional elds. in d = 10, corresponding to e8, there is also a
2-form potential and a vector potential. in d = 9, corresponding to e7, there is instead just

an additional vector potential. in d = 8, there is instead an additional 0-form potential,

or axion.

there are, as we saw, three special cases that arise. for e8 the endpoint implied

by the generic discussion, namely d = 10, can be further oxidised to the bosonic sector

of d = 11 supergravity. for e7, the generic discussion leads to an endpoint in d = 9,

but again a further oxidation is possible, giving, in this case, the truncation of type iib

supergravity in d = 10 to the metric plus the self-dual 5-form. the third special case is

e4, for which the endpoint in d = 6 can be further oxidised to pure gravity in d = 7,

after rst dualising the 3-form potential to a vector in d = 6. these are the only three

cases among the en groups that contain sl(n + 1, ir) as subgroups, which explains why

in each case a further oxidation by one step is possible. (a d-dimensional theory involving
gravity, when compactied to three dimensions, is expected to exhibit an sl(d  2, ir)

13

global symmetry.)

our results for the oxidation sequences for the various en cosets in d = 3 may be pre-

sented in the following table, which serves to make apparent a rather intriguing symmetry.

the oxidation sequence for each of the three-dimensional en cosets is presented vertically,

note that in each sequence of theories represented by a vertical column in table 3, the

sequence of symmetry groups is obtained by successively deleting the vertices of the d = 3

dynkin diagram as one ascends through the dimensions. in particular, in the step from
d = 3 to d = 4, the vertex of en (with n  4) that is deleted is always the one that
connects to the extra vertex of the extended dynkin diagram for en. note also that an
entry  indicates that the sequence has an oxidation endpoint with no global symmetry
(we have not included the ten-dimensional ancestor of e7, nor the
in that dimension.

seven-dimensional ancestor of e4.)

most striking is the magic reection symmetry across the diagonal, which is much

more complete than the approximate symmetry mentioned in [8] for the non-maximally

non-compact duality groups of n = 4 pure supergravities. this might lead to a more

systematic and deeper understanding of u-dualities, since we now know of three magic

tables. as a comment we should point out that the fourth slot of the magic square of

tits-rosenfeld-freudenthal is absent; this does not seem to follow from a special choice of

real forms but rather it suggests that a new geometry remains to be discovered here.

3 non-simply-laced scalar coset sequences

in all the examples in the previous section, the global symmetry groups of the three-

dimensional scalar cosets were simply-laced. there are further examples in the classica-

tion of [2] for which the three-dimensional coset manifold has a non-simply-laced symmetry

group, namely bn, cn, g2 and f4. here, we shall consider the cases where the group is

maximally non-compact.

3.1 bn sequences

the maximally non-compact form of bn is o(n + 1, n). the d = 3 scalar coset manifold for

this case can be obtained by starting in dmax = n + 2 dimensions with a theory comprising

the metric, a dilaton, a 2-form potential and a vector potential. the lagrangian is given

by

l = r 1l  1

2d  d  1

2 ea f(3)  f(3)  1
2 e

1

2 a f(2)  f(2) ,

where a2 = 8/(dmax  2), and

f(3) = da(2) + 1

2 a(1)  da(1) ,

f(2) = da(1) .

(3.1)

(3.2)

(this is really a special case of the standard type of construction in string theory: if one

starts instead with n vectors in ed dimensions, one gets an o(ed d + n, ed d) symmetry
in d dimensions, enlarging to o(ed  2 + n, ed  2) in d = 3 [10].)

note that the special (stringy?) case of 1 vector added to a bosonic type i sector in

dimension 10 would possibly lead to an hyperbolic algebra of maximal rank 10, very much

like the conjectured e10 symmetry or the overextended d8 [8] of the type ii and i theories.

for a classication of hyperbolic coxeter groups see, for instance, [15].

an interesting special case arises when n = 3. the oxidation endpoint following the

above discussion would be in dmax = 5. in fact, this theory can be oxidised further, to

dmax = 6, to n = 1 supergravity, whose bosonic sector comprises the metric and a self-dual

3-form. the dimensional reduction of this theory to d = 5 and d = 4 was discussed in

detail in [14].

in particular, in d = 4, the global symmetry group is o(2, 2). when it

is further reduced to d = 3, the global symmetry becomes o(4, 3). we use the standard

notation, where we take ~a to denote the dilaton vectors for the elds coming from the
reduction of the self-dual 3-form, and ~b for those coming from the metric. in d = 3, there

are a total of 3 dilatons and 9 axions, after dualising the three kaluza-klein vectors. we

can verify that the 9 axion dilaton vectors form the full set of positive roots of o(4, 3), with
~b12, ~b23 and ~a12 being the simple roots:

15

~b23

~b12
~a12
o  o === 

diagram 6: the dilaton vectors ~b12, ~b23 and ~a12 generate the b3 dynkin diagram,
with the black dot indicating the shorter root. the 2-form potential leads to a branch-

ing o here of the shorter root.

the reason why the further oxidation to dmax = 6 is possible in this case is that the

o(4, 3) group contains sl(4, ir) as a subgroup. this sl(4, ir) is associated with the global

symmetry already present in any theory involving gravity, indicating an oxidation endpoint

in dmax = 6.

for higher ns the growth of the linear subgroup of bn is away from the small root.

3.2 cn sequences

the maximally non-compact form of cn is sp(2n, ir), and the corresponding three- dimen-

sional scalar cosets are sp(2n, ir)/u (n). these cosets are dierent from the others that

we have discussed, in that their oxidation endpoints are all in four dimensions, and no

further oxidations beyond d = 4 are possible. the endpoints in dmax = 4 have the global
symmetry sp(2n  2, ir) [2].

to see this, let ~ be the (n  1)-component positive-root vectors of sp(2n  2, ir).

these can be written in terms of a basis of (n  1) unit vectors ~ei as

~ei  ~ej ,

i > j ,

and

2 ~ei ,

(3.3)

where we are dening positivity in terms of the sign of the rst non-vanishing component

starting from the right. the simple roots are

~ei+1  ~ei ,

and

2 ~e1 .

the full set of positive roots for sp(2n, ir) is then given by the n-component vectors

(~, 0) ,

(~ei, 1) ,

(~0, 2) .

(3.4)

(3.5)

these have a simple kaluza-klein interpretation as a reduction from d = 4 to d = 3.
the root (~0, 2) arises as the dilaton vector associated with the dual of the kaluza-klein

16

vector, while the roots (~, 0) originate from the dilaton vectors of the axions in an sp(2n
2, ir)/u (n  1) scalar coset in d = 4, with ~ as positive root vectors. the roots (~ei, 1)
arise as the dilaton vectors for the direct dimensional reductions of a set of (n  1) vector
potentials ai
(0) in d = 3. in addition, the vector potentials will also

(1), to give axions ai

give rise to vector potentials in d = 3, and after dualising these to axions, their associated
dilaton vectors will be (~ei, 1), accounting for the remaining root vectors in (3.5). thus
the sp(2n, ir)/u (n) sigma model in d = 3 oxidises to give the lagrangian

in d = 4. here, the (n  1) dilatons ~ = (1, , n1) are associated with the cartan
subalgebra of sp(2n  2, ir), and the 1

the axions associated with the positive roots of sp(2n  2, ir). the vector potentials ai
transform under the fundamental representation of sp(2n  2, ir).

sequence of three-dimensional scalar cosets. one way to see this is to note that the eld
(2) in (3.6) have dilaton vectors ~ei that all have (length)2 = 1. if (3.6) were to
come from the kaluza-klein reduction of a theory in d = 5, then the kaluza-klein vector

from this reduction step would have to be interpreted as one of the vector potentials in

d = 4. this is not possible, however, since the kaluza-klein vector would have a dilaton
vector with (length)2 = 3, rather than (length)2 = 1. thus dmax = 4 is the oxidation

endpoint for the cn sequence of three-dimensional scalar cosets.

we may recall here that the ane extension of the group symmetry after reduction to 2
dimensions includes a manifest sl(dmax  2, ir) symmetry. a look at the dynkin diagram
of the ane c 1
n immediately shows that dmax = 4, since the linear subgroup should start

from one of the long root vertices.

3.3 g2 sequence

there is a g2/(su (2)  su (2)) maximally non-compact scalar coset theory in d = 3 [2].
we nd that it can be oxidised back to an endpoint in dmax = 5, where it becomes the

bosonic sector of simple supergravity. this is the einstein-maxwell system in d = 5, with

an f f a term:

l5 = r 1l  1

2f(2)  f(2) + 1
33

f(2)  f(2)  a(1) .

(3.7)

upon reduction to d = 3, we obtain, in the standard notation, the lagrangian

l = r 1l  1

after dualising the vector potentials to give axions, we see that there will be six axions,

together with the two dilatons. we nd that we may take the dilaton vectors ~1 = (3, 1)
and ~2 = ( 23
with the remaining dilaton vectors expressed in terms of these as
(3, 1) = ~1+3~2 ,

( 13

( 13

it is easily veried that ~1 and ~2 generate the dynkin diagram for g2:

o   .

(3.10)

it is interesting to look also at the global symmetry of the oxidation of the g2 coset

to d = 4. from the g2 dynkin diagram, we expect that there should be an sl(2, ir)

symmetry. the d = 4 lagrangian is

l4 = r 1l  1

(2)  f 1

(2)

(3.11)

it can be seen from this that the scalar manifold, comprising the dilaton 1 and the axion

a(0)1, indeed has an sl(2, ir) symmetry. it can also be seen that the 1-component dilaton

vectors for the two vector potentials, together with their negatives, form the weights of the

4-dimensional representation of sl(2, ir).

a discussion of the dimensional reduction of simple supergravity in d = 5, and its global

symmetry, was also given in [16].

3.4 f4 sequence

we nd that the oxidation endpoint of the f4 sequence is a dmax = 6 dimensional theory,

containing the metric, a dilaton, an axion, two vectors, a 2-form potential and a self-dual

3-form eld strength. the lagrangian is given by

l6 = r 1l  1

(3.12)

18

the self-duality condition on the 3-form g(3) is to be imposed after having obtained the

equations of motion. the eld strengths are given in terms of potentials as follows:

f(3) = da(2) + 1
(1) + 12

f +
(2) = da+

2 a(1)  da(1) ,

g(3) = db(2)  12

 f(3)  1

2 a+

(1)  da(1) ,

 da(1) ,

f (2) = da(1) .

(3.13)

it is easily veried that the self-duality constraint is consistent with the equations of motion

and bianchi identities. it can also be seen that the theory described by (3.12) has a global
sl(2, ir) symmetry at the level of the equations of motion, with the two vectors a+
(1) and a(1)
forming a doublet, and the 3-form elds f(3), f(3) and g(3) forming the (+,, 2) components
of a triplet. as we shall explain in section 3.5, the lagrangian (3.12) can be obtained by

starting with the eight-dimensional lagrangian (2.13) which is the oxidation endpoint of the

e6 sequence, and reducing to d = 6. after performing the reduction, the six-dimensional
lagrangian has a gl(2, ir)  sl(2, ir) global symmetry. a consistent truncation can then
be performed, under which a diagonal sl(2, ir) survives; this truncated theory is described
by the lagrangian (3.12) together with the self-duality constraint g(3) = g(3). this six-
dimensional theory is the bosonic sector of a supersymmetric n = 1 chiral supergravity,

with two anti-self-dual tensor multiplets and two vector multiplets. this is a similar to

the class of chiral six-dimensional supergravities constructed in [17]; see appendix b for a

detailed discussion.

the elds f(3), g(3), f +

in the standard notation, and associating dilaton vectors ~a, ~e, ~c +, ~c , ~b and ~h with
(2), f (2), f and  respectively, we nd, after reduction to d = 3 and
dualisation of the vectors, that the dilaton vectors of all the 24 axions form the positive
1 and ~h are the positive
roots of the exceptional lie algebra f4. in particular, ~b23, ~b12, ~c +

1 and ~h generate the f4 dynkin diagram.

from this dynkin diagram, it is straightforward to see that the oxidations of the three-

dimensional f4 theory to d = 4 and d = 5 will have global symmetries sp(6, ir) and

sl(3, ir) respectively.

19

3.5 embedding in simply-laced cosets

the non-simply-laced algebras can all be interpreted as embeddings in larger simply-laced

algebras. at the level of their dynkin diagrams, these embeddings can be viewed as folding

over the diagrams for the simply-laced diagrams, so that two or more vertices become

identied. these are described in terms of satake diagrams in [18]. these identications in

turn have an interpretation at the level of the coset lagrangians, as consistent truncations

of the lagrangians for the simply-laced groups to give the lagrangians for the non-simply-

laced groups. we shall discuss the various cases below.

3.5.1 bn1 embedded in dn
one can obtain the bn1 dynkin diagram from the dn dynkin diagram, given in diagram
2, by folding over and identifying the vertices ~b12 and ~a12. this implies the existence of a
consistent truncation of the three-dimensional lagrangian (2.7) in which the axions a1
(0)i
are equated to a(0)1i, and the axion 1 is equated to 1. in fact the easiest way to see this

is to look at the lagrangian in d = n + 1, obtained by performing a single circle reduction

of the oxidation endpoint lagrangian (2.5) for the dn coset. in d = n + 1, we obtain the

lagrangian

l = r 1l  1

~b1~ f 1
 1
2 e

2d~  d~  1
(2)  1

(2)  f 1

2 e~a1~ f(2)1  f(2)1
2 e~a~ f(3)  f(3) .

(3.14)

it is easily seen that the two 2-form eld strengths f(2)1 and f 1
(2) can be equated provided
that the two dilatons in ~ are also truncated to a single dilaton combination, such that
(~a1  ~b1)  ~ = 0. dening

a = 1

2|~a1 + ~b1| ,

1

2 (~a1 + ~b1)  ~ = a  ,

f(2) = 2f(2)1 = 2f 1

(2) ,

(3.15)

it follows that (3.14) can be consistently truncated to give (3.1), in d = n + 1. this is
indeed the lagrangian that describes the oxidation endpoint of the bn1 scalar coset in
d = 3. it is easily seen that the identication of the two 1-form potentials in d = n + 1

implies precisely the set of identications of axions given above equation (3.14).

3.5.2 g2 embedded in d4

the dynkin diagram for g2 can be obtained from that of d4, by identifying the three
vertices corresponding to the three mutually orthogonal simple roots. as in the bn1
example above, the associated consistent truncation can best be described in the endpoint

20

dimension of the non-simply-laced coset, namely dmax = 5 for this g2 case. the endpoint

dimension for the d4 coset is dmax = 6, where there is the metric, a dilaton and a 2-form

potential, as described by (2.5). upon reduction to d = 5, this theory can be consistently

truncated to the bosonic sector of d = 5 simple supergravity, with lagrangian given by
(3.7). this is achieved by equating the three 2-form eld strengths f 1
(2), f(2)1 and f(3).
it is easy to see that from the three-dimensional viewpoint, these identications lead to

identications of the axions that imply precisely the identication of the three simple roots
~b12, ~b34 and ~a12 that form the ears of the d4 dynkin diagram in diagram 2.

3.5.3 f4 embedded in e6

this embedding corresponds to an identication of the pair of simple roots ~b12 and ~c, and the
pair of simple roots ~b23 and ~a123, of the e6 algebra given in diagram 5. the corresponding
consistent truncation of the lagrangian can be most conveniently performed in the oxidation

endpoint dimension dmax = 6 of the three-dimensional f4 scalar lagrangian. on the

other hand the endpoint of the e6 sequence, as discussed in section 2.3.2, is in dmax = 8.

dimensionally reducing the lagrangian (2.13) to d = 6, we can make a consistent truncation
to give the lagrangian (3.12), by equating the axions  and a1
(0)2, and the 2-form elds
f 2
(2) and f(2)12. in this truncation, the dual of the 4-form eld strength f(4) is set equal
to f 1
identications of elds in d = 3 imply precisely the identication of simple roots listed

(2), and the eld f(3)2 is required to be self-dual. it is easy to see that the consequent

above, describing the embedding of f4 in e6.

3.5.4 cn embedded in a2n1
this embedding is described by folding over the dynkin diagram of a2n1 at its midpoint,
so that (n  1) pairs of simple roots are identied. as usual, we make the correspond-
ing consistent truncation in the lagrangian in the oxidation endpoint dimension, namely
dmax = 4 for this cn sequence. the oxidation endpoint for the a2n1 sequence is pure
gravity in dmax = 2n + 2. dimensionally reducing this to d = 4, we can make a consistent

truncation given by

(2) = f 2n1i
f i

(2)

,

(1)j = f 2n1j
f i

(1)2n1i .

(3.16)

this truncation gives precisely the lagrangian (3.6). the dilaton vectors ~ei in (3.6) are
given by ~ei = ~bi  ~b2n1i, and they are indeed orthonormal. reducing one step further
to d = 3, we can see that the consequent identications of axions imply the necessary
identication rules for obtaining the dynkin diagram of cn from that of a2n1.

4 non-maximally non-compact cosets

the discussion of three-dimensional g/h scalar coset theories where g is not maximally

non-compact becomes somewhat involved, and we shall not attempt a complete classication

of their oxidation endpoints here. the principal examples, from our point of view, are the
sets of cosets o(p, q)/(o(p) o(q)), su (p, q)/s(u (p) u (q)) and so(2n)/u (n). the rst
of these sets is easily understood from a higher-dimensional standpoint. it is well known that

a ten-dimensional n = 1 string with m vector potentials gives rise upon toroidal dimensional
reduction to a theory with o(10+md, 10d) global symmetry in 5  d  10 dimensions,
o(6+m, 6)sl(2, ir) in d = 4, and o(8+m, 8) in d = 3. this generalises straightforwardly
to other starting dimensions. thus if we suppose, without loss of generality, that p > q, we
may oxidise the three-dimensional o(q+m, q)/(o(q+m)o(q)) scalar coset to dmax = q+2
dimensions, where it corresponds to a theory similar to that of an n = 1 string, comprising

the metric, a dilaton, a 2-form potential and m 1-form potentials ai

other non-maximally non-compact cosets, including some further isolated examples,

are discussed in [2], where their oxidations to d = 4 are given.

it may be that these

cases, like the cn sequences discussed in section 3.2, cannot be further oxidised beyond four

dimensions, but we have not investigated this in detail. one result is that all cosets that are

hermitean symmetric spaces have oxidation endpoints in d = 4. another observation is

that all quaternionic spaces technically homogeneous under the borel subgroup (also called

alekseevskian spaces) have maximal oxidation dimension 6. for a discussion of the relation

of these spaces to supergravities, see for instance, [19].

one example among those conjectured in [4, 8] was constructed recently as an anomalous

but classically supersymmetric theory, in [20].

5 summary and conclusions

we have examined g/h scalar coset lagrangians in three dimensions, for all the cases where

g is a simple maximally-non-compact group, and h is its maximal compact subgroup. in

all cases, the three-dimensional scalar lagrangian can be re-interpreted as coming from

22

the toroidal dimensional reduction of some higher-dimensional theory comprising gravity,

possibly with additional antisymmetric tensor elds and dilatons. thus we have introduced

the notion of the oxidation endpoint of a three-dimensional scalar coset lagrangian, by

which we mean the theory in the highest possible dimension whose toroidal dimensional

reduction yields (after dualisation of all vector potentials to axions) precisely the originally-

given three-dimensional theory. in many cases the elds of the three-dimensional theory

can be produced rather economically from the higher dimension, in that many three-

dimensional elds are generated from each of a few higher-dimensional ones. by contrast

there are other cases, most notably the sp(2n, ir)/u (n) three-dimensional scalar cosets,

where less advantage is gained by oxidation. for example, the sp(2n, ir)/u (n) theories can

be oxidised only as far as d = 4.

we may summarise the oxidation endpoint dimensions for all the simple maximally-non-

compact three-dimensional g/h cosets in the following table. complete details, together

with any particular discussion for special cases, may be found in the earlier sections. (note
that for the sp(2n, ir)/u (n) cosets the eld contents of the dmax = 4 theory includes (n1)
dilatons ~, 1

table 4: oxidation endpoints for maximally-non-compact cosets

a compact way to summarise the build-up of hidden dimensions is that e8, e7, g2, b3

and an can be lifted to a dimension equal to their rank plus three, e6, f4, dn and bn

can be lifted to their rank plus 2 dimensions, and nally cn can be lifted to dimension 4.

the oxidation endpoints of the a1, g2, b3, f4, e8, d8 and b8 scalar cosets are theories

23

that admit supersymmetric extensions, while the endpoints for all other cosets are not the

bosonic sectors of any supersymmetric theory.

b the f4 oxidation endpoint and chiral d = 6 supergravity

in general, the theories corresponding to the oxidation endpoints of the various three-

dimensional sigma-model lagrangians that we have considered in this paper are rather

straightforward to analyse. one case is slightly more involved, namely the six-dimensional

oxidation endpoint of the f4 scalar coset, discussed in section 3.4. here, we present the

details of the proof that it corresponds to the bosonic sector of an n = 1 chiral supergravity

in d = 6, with two anti-self-dual tensor multiplets, and two abelian vector multiplets.

from (3.12), we see that g(3) satises dg(3) =  12

(1) da(1), while from
(3.13), we see that the bianchi identity for dg(3) gives an identical expression. this shows
that we can indeed consistently impose the self-duality constraint g(3) = g(3) after having
obtained the equations of motion.

d( f(3)) 1

the equation of motion for f(3) is

 d(e2 f(3)) + 1

2 d(2 f(3)) +2 d( g(3)) 1

(2)) + 1
22

d( a+

we wish to make a comparison with the chiral n = 1 six-dimensional supergravity

described in [17]. in [17], there is 1 self-dual 3-form h(3), and n anti-self-dual 3-forms k m
(3).

26

we have the opposite convention, so we have 1 anti-self-dual h(3), and, in our case, n = 2
self-dual 3-forms k m

(3), with m = 1, 2. we may relate these elds and our elds g(3) and

f(3), as follows:

2

h(3) = 1

2 e 1
2 e 1
(3) = g(3) .

(3) = 1

k 1

k 2

2

 (f(3)  f(3)) ,
 (f(3) + f(3)) ,

(b.5)

we can now express these in terms of our three eld strengths dened in (b.4), by making

use of the results in (b.3). in fact it is advantageous at this point to dene

the elds f 0

(3), f 1

(3) and f 2

(3) (r = 0, 1, 2) elds of [17]. thus

f (3)  f 1

(3) ,

(3) + f 0

(3)  f 0
(3) ,
(3) will now correspond to the f r

f +
(3)  f 1

f 2

summed over the various factors in the yang-mills gauge group, labelled by z, where z

are the chern-simons forms for each factor and cr

will be slightly dierent: we have two u (1) factors, with 1-form potentials that we may call
a+
(1) and a(1); they form a spinor of so(1, 2). we shall need a third vector combining the

previous two, namely

a(1) = a(1)  a+
(1) .

(b.13)

actually the so(1, 2) covariance will be preserved by choosing for the coecients cr

(b.14)

(in each case, one is free to add any total derivative to , since the only important point is
that d = f(2)  f(2) in each factor.)

note that a+

(1) and a(1) are precisely the two u (1) gauge potentials appearing in our

lagrangian (3.12). from (b.4) and (b.6), we have

where the supergravity multiplet, with its anti-self-dual tensor multiplet, is supplemented

by two self-dual tensor matter multiplets, and two abelian vector matter multiplets. the

structure of the chern-simons terms is a slight modication of that given in [17].
