abstract

we calculate the coecient a5 of the heat kernel asymptotics for
an operator of laplace type with mixed boundary conditions on a
general compact manifold.

1 introduction

let v be a vector bundle over a smooth compact riemannian manifold m of
dimension m with smooth boundary m. let d be a second order operator
of laplace type on c (v ); this means the leading symbol of d is given by
the metric tensor, or equivalently, that d has the form given in equations
(1) and (2) below. note that many natural second order operators which
arise in applications are of laplace type.
if the boundary is non-empty,
then we must impose suitable boundary conditions. we assume given a
decomposition v |m = vn  vd; extend the decomposition to be parallel
with respect to the normal geodesic rays on a collared neighborhood of the
boundary. let s be an auxiliary endomorphism of the bundle vn and let ;m

be the covariant derivative of   c (v ) with respect to the inward unit
normal. decompose  = n  d and set
b := d|vd  (n

;m + sn )|vn .

dirichlet boundary conditions correspond to vanishing vn ; robin (i.e. modi-
ed neumann) boundary conditions correspond to vanishing vd. let db be
the realization of d;   domain(db) if and only if b = 0. this is an ellip-
tic boundary value problem and satises the lopatinski-shapiro condition.
let f be an auxiliary smooth function on m, for use in localization or
smearing. let etdb be the fundamental solution of the heat equation; this
is trace class on l2(v ) and as t  0, there is an asymptotic expansion:

trl2(f etdb) = xn0

t(nm)/2an(f, d,b);

see [11, 12, 16] for details. the invariants an(f, d,b) are locally computable
in terms of geometric invariants and form the focus of our study.
the study of these invariants can be physically motivated. consider a
eld theory in which d denes the quadratic form of the action; see, for
example [9]. we note that consistent local boundary conditions for elds
of non-zero spin are inevitably mixed ones. the one-loop eective action is
(formally) given by log det(d). the heat kernel coecients up to am de-
scribe ultraviolet divergencies of the theory. the coecient am also denes
the scale anomaly. the leading term in the large mass expansion of the ef-
fective action is given by am+1; the lower coecients are usually absorbed
in renormalizations. variations of the heat kernel coecients give vacuum
expectation values of currents, see [4] for example. the study of these coe-
cients is important for renormalization and calculation of anomalies in higher
dimensional models [17], and for large mass expansion and calculation of cur-
rents in four dimensions.

mckean and singer [14] studied the invariants a0, a1, and a2. kennedy
et al. [10] studied the invariant a3. moss and dowker [15] studied a4 for
the scalar laplacian. branson and gilkey [1] determined a4 in the vector
valued case; a minor error in the calculation of two of the coecients was
later corrected by vassilevich [18]. these results are summarized in theorem
2.1. many other authors have also studied these coecients.

we say the boundary conditions are pure if vn or vd vanishes. the
coecient a5 has been determined previously for pure boundary conditions.
branson, gilkey and vassilevich [3] studied the special cases of a domain m
in at space and of a curved domain with totally geodesic boundary. kirsten
[13] generalized these results to arbitrary manifolds and boundaries; see also
dowker and kirsten [6] for related work. we summarize the results of those

2

papers in lemmas 2.2 and 2.3. the main result of this paper is theorem 2.4
which gives a5 for general mixed boundary conditions.

we have decoupled the calculation of a5 in the general setting into three
pieces. the rst piece, a1
5, was computed in [3]; it gives a5 for pure boundary
conditions if the boundary is totally geodesic. the second piece a2
5 was
computed in [13]; it contains the terms involving the second fundamental
form which are necessary to deal with the case where the boundary is not
totally geodesic [13]. the nal piece a3
5 is computed in this paper; it contains
the additional 42 terms which describe the interaction of vn and vd for
general mixed boundary conditions. our purpose in this paper is not purely
combinatorial; determining these additional coecients requires us to derive
new functorial properties of the invariants which are important in their own
right.

in 3, we use invariance theory to show that the computation of a5 can
be decomposed into the three pieces discussed above and to show that the
undetermined coecients wi describing the interaction of vn and vd are
universal coecients which are dimension free. the remainder of the paper is
devoted to computing these coecients; see the cross reference table following
theorem 2.4. we postpone until appendices a, b, and c the discussion of
some combinatorial formulas we shall need.

we use three dierent technical tools in the proof of theorem 2.4.
1. the index theorem. let p : c (v )  c (w ) be an elliptic
complex of dirac type.
impose suitable boundary conditions. let
d := p p and d := p p  be the associated operators of laplace type.
an observation of bott shows that with suitable boundary conditions
am(1, d,b) am(1, d,b) = index(p ) and an(1, d,b) an(1, d,b) = 0
if n 6= m; this is often called the local index formula. we shall apply
this observation in 4 and in 7.

2. conformal variations. let d() = e2f d. we then have that
d
d|=0an(1, d,b) = (m  n)an(f, d,b). furthermore, if m = n + 2,
then d

d|=0an(e2f f, e2f d,b) = 0. we use these identities in 6.

3. calculations on the ball. the invariant an was computed for the
laplacians on spinors and on 1-forms on the ball in [5, 7]; we use this
computation in 5.

2 statement of results

if d is an operator of laplace type, then locally we have:

d = (g + a + b).

(1)

3

here g acts by scalar multiplication; a and b are matrix valued. we
can also express d covariantly. there is a unique connection  on v and a
unique endomorphism e of v so that

d = (tr(2) + e).

(2)

let  be the local 1-form of the connection . we may express:

2g(a + g

 = 1
e = b  g( +   

iv ) and

).

if d is the scalar laplacian, then  is the at connection and e = 0. if
d = d + d on the bundle of p forms, then  is levi-civita connection
and the endomorphism e is given in terms of curvature by the weitzenbock
formulas. let  be the scalar curvature. if d is the spin laplacian, then 
is the spin connection, and the lichnerowicz formula gives e =  1
4  .
we adopt the following notational conventions to express the asymptotic
coecients an in terms of geometrical invariants. let roman indices i, j, k,
and l range from 1 through the dimension m of the manifold and index a
local orthonormal frame {e1, ..., em} for the tangent bundle of the manifold.
let roman indices a, b, c, and d range from 1 through m  1 and index a
local orthonormal frame for the tangent bundle of the boundary m. on
the boundary, we shall let em be the inward unit normal vector eld. we
shall not introduce bundle indices explicitly. let tr(a) be the ber trace of
an endomorphism a of v . greek indices will index coordinate frames. we
adopt the einstein convention and sum over repeated indices.
let rijkl be the components of the curvature tensor of the levi-civita
connection, let ij := rikkj be the components of the ricci tensor, and let
 := ii be the scalar curvature. with our sign convention, r1212 = 1 on the
unit sphere s2 in euclidean space. let ij be the endomorphism-valued com-
ponents of the curvature of the connection  on v . let  be the christoel
symbols of the levi-civita connection. let lab := (eaeb, em) = abm give
the second fundamental form. we use the levi-civita connections and the
connection  to covariantly dierentiate tensors of all types. let ; denote
multiple covariant dierentiation with respect to the levi-civita connection
of m and let : denote multiple tangential covariant dierentiation on the
boundary with respect to the levi-civita connection of the boundary; the
dierence between ; and : is measured by the second fundamental form.
thus, for example, e;a = e:a since there are no tangential indices in e to be
dierentiated. on the other hand, e;ab 6= e:ab since the index a is also being
dierentiated. since l and s are only dened on the boundary, these tensors
can only be dierentiated tangentially. let dx and dy be the riemannian

4

volume elements on m and on m respectively. let f1  c (m) and let
f2  c (m). let

f1[m] := r m f1(x)dx and f2[m] = r m f2(y)dy.

let  be orthogonal projection on vd and let + be orthogonal projec-
tion on vn . let  := +  ;  = +1 on vn and  = 1 on vd. extend
 to be parallel along normal geodesic rays. we refer to [1] for the proof of
the following result:

the main result of this section is the following technical result.

5( ~w))[m].

let n (f ) = f;m...m be the th normal covariant derivative of the smear-
ing function f . let rijkl, ij, and e have order 2; let lab and s have order
1, and let  have order 0. we increase the order by 1 for every explicit
covariant derivative. the following lemma is proved in [1] and summarizes
some of the properties of the invariants an that we shall need.

lemma 3.2

8

1. there exists an invariant local formula am

n (x, d) on m which
is homogeneous of order n and which vanishes if n is odd, and there
exist invariant local formulas am
n, (y, d,b) on m which are
homogeneous of order n    1 so that

n, = am

n = am

an(f, d,b) = tr(f am

n )[m] + x0n1

tr(n (f )am

n, )[m].

2. let m = m1  m2 for m1 closed. let d = d1  1 + 1  d2. then

am

n (x, d) = xp+q=n
n, (y, d,b) = xp+q=n
3. let d = d1  d2 over m. then

am
n (x, d) = am

n, (y, d,b) = am

n, (y, d1,b) + am

n, (y, d2,b).

4. we have the following variational formulas:

d

d|=0am2(e2f f, e2f d,b) = 0 and
d|=0an(1, e2f d,b) = (m  n)an(f, d,b).

d

5. let p : c (v1)  c (v2) be an elliptic complex of dirac type. let
d := p p and let d := p p  be the associated operators of laplace
type. with suitable boundary conditions, we have:

am(1, d,b)  am(1, d, b) = index(p ) and
an(1, d,b)  an(1, d, b) = 0 if n 6= m.

the invariants which do not involve the interaction between vd and vn
were determined in [3, 13]. there are no interior invariants since 5 is odd.
to complete the proof of lemma 3.1, we must exhibit a spanning set for the
space of boundary invariants which are homogeneous of order 4; assertion 2
and 3 of lemma 3.2 show that the constants wi are dimension free. we can
eliminate some terms from consideration:

lemma 3.3 let x be an arbitrary scalar monomial.

1. the following invariants do not appear in a5: x:ae:a, :a:abb,
am(s:a + s:a), :a:bxab, ams:a, f;m:as:a, (:aa  :aa)e,
xij:akl, and :ajk;i.

9

2. the following invariants are linear combinations of the invariants den-

5: :aa:bb, :ab:ab, :aa:bb, :ab:ab, :ab:a:b,

ing a3
:ab:b:a, and :aa:b:b.

3. we have the following relations: tr(:a:b:a:b) = 0,

tr(:axa) = 0, (tr:a:ax) = 0, tr(:abxab) = 0, and
tr(:axa) = 0.

proof: we use arguments of [2] to prove the rst assertion. let the smearing
function f be real. suppose that the bundle v , the operator d, and the
endomorphisms s and  are real. it then follows that tr(f etdb) is real.
thus all the coecients must be real. suppose next that v is complex, that
 is hermitian, and that e, s, and  are self-adjoint. then the operator
db is self-adjoint and again tr(f etdb) is real. the curvature tensor ij is
anti-hermitian as it is a commutator of two covariant derivatives. the terms
in the rst assertion have purely imaginary trace and thus do will not appear
in the formula for am

.

5

let {a, b} := ab + ba be the anti-commutator. we dierentiate the

identity 2 = 1 to see

{, :a} = 0,
{:ab, } + {:a, :b} = 0,
{:aab, } + {:aa, :b} + 2{:ab, :a} = 0.

we use the ricci identity to see that, at the cost of getting additional
terms involving , the fourth derivative of  can be reduced to terms with
lower derivatives. thus

{:aabb, } + (fewer derivatives in ) = 0.

we dierentiate the relation s = s = s to see that:

s:a + s:a = s:a = :as + s:a
s:ab = s:ab + s:a:b + s:b:a + s:ab
= :abs + :as:b + :bs:a + s:ab.

(3)

we also observe that:

1
2

tr(:a:b:ab) =
tr(:a:a:bb) = tr(:a:a:b:b).

tr(:a:b{, :ab}) =

1
2

tr(:a:a:b:b)

we use equation (3) to see that we do not need a , a :a nor a :aa touching
an s. we use the identities tr(:as:blab) = 0 and

tr(s:ablab) = tr(s:a:blab) = tr(s:a:blab)

10

together with equation (3) to see that tr(:as) = 0, tr(s:b) = tr(s:b),

tr(s:as:a) = tr(2s:as:a  s:as:a), and
tr(s:ablab) = tr(s:ablab  s:ablab  2s:a:blab)

= tr(s:ablab  s:a:blab). 

in addition to the relations of lemma 3.3, we note that terms obtained

by commuting the order of derivatives are controlled by the ricci identity.

proof of lemma 3.1: we have eliminated most of the additional possible
terms which might otherwise be thought to appear in the local formula for
a5. note that terms of the form :abxab are controlled by :a:bxab. there
are, however, a few remaining terms to be eliminated. we order these terms
by length and complete the proof by eliminating these terms.

1. (terms of length 2). as ab is antisymmetric, we have tr(:abab) = 0.

2. (terms of length 3). we use the ricci identity to see that

:abab =

1
2

(:ab  :ba)ab =

1
2

[, ab]ab.

the terms on the right hand side are controlled and thus we may omit
tr(:ab) from our list of invariants. a similar argument shows we
may omit tr(:abab) from our list of invariants. we use lemma 3.3
to exclude the invariant :aae  :aae. we control the invariant
:aae + :aae by :a:ae.

3. (terms of length 4). by equation (3), tr(:abab) = 0. 
the following relations follow from lemma 2.3 and from the product

formula of assertion 2 of lemma 3.2.

lemma 3.4 we have w3 + w4 = 600, w19 = 180, w22 = 30, w5 + w7 = 0,
and w6 = 120.

4 two dimensional calculations

let d be an operator of laplace type on the trivial vector bundle over the
cylinder m := s1  [0, 1], which we endow with the standard at metric. we
specialize the formula for a5 to the situation at hand. we set l = 0, r = 0,
f = 1, m = 2, and a = b = c = 1. this yields the expression:

a5(1, d,b) = 57601(4)1/2tr{360e;22 + 1440e;2s + 720e2

+w35:11:11 + w36:1:1:11 + w37:1:111}[m].

we use the relation w3 + w4 = 600 to see that

tr(960ss:11 + w3s:1s:1 + w4s:1s:1)[m]

= tr(360s:1s:1  2w4s:1s:1)[m].

we integrate by parts to see f:1g[m] = f g:1[m]. we use this relation to
see tr(:1:1:11)[m] = 0 and to simplify the expression for a5. this shows:

a5(1, d,b) = 57601(4)1/2tr{360e;22 + 1440e;2s + 720e2

+2880es2 + 1440s4 + w1e2 + w2ee  360s:1s:1

+(w32 + w33):1:1:1:1 + (w34 + w35  w37):11:11}[m].

lemma 4.1 we have

w1 = 180 w2 = 180
w8 = 45 w9 = 180
w15 = 90

w3 = 120 w4 = 720
w10 = 45 w11 = 360

w19 = 180 w20 = 90 w21  w18 = 60

proof: we apply the local index formula of lemma 3.2 (5). let i, j, and k
be real skew-adjoint 4  4 matrices satisfying the quaternion relations. let

a := a0 + ia1 + ja2 + ka3
b := b0 + ib1 + jb2 + kb3

for ~a  r  1r3
for ~b  1r  r3

be matrix valued functions on m. then a = a and b = b. let
p := i1 + j2 + a + b and p  := i1 + j2 + a  b

be operators of dirac type and let d := p p and d := p p  be the associated
operators of laplace type. let  := 1i; we note that 2 = 1, i = i,
and j = j. let  := 1
2(1  ) be the complementary projections on

12

the 1 eigenspaces of . we dene admissible boundary operators b and b
of mixed type which make d and d self-adjoint:

b := ()|m  (p )|m , and b := ()|m  (p )|m .
since p intertwines d and d and since the index of this complex is zero,

an(1, d,b) = an(1, d, b).

obtain the following system of equations.

if we interchange b and b, then we interchange the roles of p and p  and
the roles of d and d. thus the terms of odd degree in b must vanish in
an(1, d,b). let a = 1a,
b = 1b, a = 2a, and b = 2b. we rst study
the terms which are bilinear in the jets of a and b. these terms change sign
if we interchange the roles of d and d and hence their coecient in a5 must
be zero. let j := 2tr(i) and k := 21tr(i). we use lemmas a.1-a.3 to
(a0 b3j )
b3j )
( a0
(a1 b3k)
(a3 b0j )
( a3b0j )
( a3 b2k)

0 = 2w8 + 2w10 + 2w15
0 = 2w8 + 2w10
0 = 2w9 + 2(240  w18 + w21)
0 = 2w2  2w1
0 = 2w2 + 2w1 + 1
0 = 2(240  w18 + w21)  360
0 = 4w8 + 4w10 + 1440  12w15

21440

this implies that:

w8 = 45, w9 = 180, w10 = 45, w2 = 180,
w1 = 180, (240  w18 + w21) = 180, w15 = 90.

next we set a0 = a1 = a2 = 0, we let a3 be a constant, and we assume
b = b(x1). this yields the following system of equations we use to complete
the proof of lemma 4.1.

0 = 4w20  6(240  w18 + w21) + 2  720
0 = 8w20  2w4 + 8(240  w18 + w21)
0 = 4w8 + 4w10  4w15
0 = 4w19 + 1

5 calculations on the ball

in this section, we compare the results of calculations on the ball performed
in [5, 7] with the formula from theorem 2.4 to establish the following result:

13

lemma 5.1 we have the following relations:

135 = 2w27 + 4w33 + 2w35
705 = 16w28 + 16w29  4w31 + 16w32  16w33 + 16w34  16w37
1725 = 2w3 + 32w26  8w30
675 = 32w26
1935 = 16w28 + 16w29  8w30 + 32w32 + 32w34 + 16w35 + 32w36  32w37
585 = 4w27  2w31 + 8w32 + 16w33 + 8w34 + 12w35  8w36  8w37.

proof: we start with the dirac spinors. let i  m2[m/2] be the dirac gamma
matrices; these satisfy the cliord commutation relation jk +kj = 2kj.
let p =  be an operator of dirac type. we assume that the connection
is compatible, in other words  = 0, or in index notation, [, ] = 0. for
m even, let

5 := (1)m/21 . . . m.

we then have (5)2 = 1 and 5j + j5 = 0. we refer to [2] for further
information concerning the spectral geometry of the dirac operator with local
boundary conditions. we use formulas from [2]. consider the boundary value
problem for the corresponding laplacian d = p 2. we set

 := 5m and s :=  1

2 laa+

to dene admissible boundary conditions. the endomorphism e, the rie-
mann curvature and  are zero. since lab:c = 0 and lab = ab, we have:

:a = lac5c, :ab = laclbc, s:a =  1

4lbb:a, s:ab = 1

4lddlaclbc.

we have vol(sm1) = 2m/2/( m
2 ). we compare coecients of the powers
of m  1 in the above equation with the general formula of theorem 2.4 to
establish the rst three equations of lemma 5.1.
next we study vector elds (or 1-forms) on the unit ball with absolute
boundary conditions. for these boundary conditions,  can be viewed as a
matrix acting in the tangent space to m:

mm = 1, ba = ba, and

s = +.

14

as above, e = 0, r = 0, and  = 0. we have that:

(:a)mb = (:a)bm = 2ab
(:ab)mm = 4ab ,

(:ab)cd = 2(cdad + acbd).

we use [7] (see also [8, 19]) to see the following relationship from which

proof: we use lemma 3.2 (4). consider the variations d() = e2f d,
g() = e2f g, and f () = e2f f . we set

s() = ef +{m(0)  m() + s}.

to x the boundary conditions. let ei be an orthonormal frame for the
tangent and cotangent bundles of m with respect to the reference metric
g(0). let ei() = ef ei and ei() = ef ei be the corresponding frames for the
metric g(). we remark that contraction and dierentiation do not commute;

let m be the generalized cylinder m := s1  s1....  s1  [0, 1] for m even
with the conformally at metric

m).

let i be skew-adjoint matrices satisfying the cliord relations. let

a := ef (ii) and a := emf (ii)e(m1)f .

let d[0] := aa and d[1] := aa be the associated laplacians. we set

5 := (1)m/21 . . . m,  := 5m
b[0] := ()|m  (a)|m , and
b[1] := ()|m  (a)|m .

we use the local index formula of lemma 3.2 (5) to see that

a5(1, d[0],b[0]) = a5(1, d[1],b[1]).

we use this relationship to derive certain additional relations among the
coecients appearing in equation (4). let a comma denote ordinary partial
dierentiation. for simplicity we put f|m = 0. this implies also f,a|m = 0,
but, in general, f,ma|m 6= 0. we compute:

jkl = f,jf,kil + f,if,ljk  f,jf,lik  f,if,kjl

we can now compute the invariants a5(1, d[i],b[i]). in equation (4), the
terms 1
2(w5  w7), w12, w13 and w17 contribute to a5 in this setting. the
invariants that appear in these contributions are f,amf,am, f,mmf 2
,m, and
thus only terms of these types need to be kept during the calculation. in
appendix c we have listed all contributions appearing in a5(1, d[1],b[1]) 
a5(1, d[0],b[0]). we therefore have the relations:

0 = 180 + w13.

we use lemma 3.4 to determine w5 and w7; w41 is now determined by the
conformal relation of the previous section. this determines all the coecients
but w14.

let m be as in lemma 6.1, let a = i(i + fi), let fm be imaginary, and
fa be real. it is obvious that a5(1, aa) = a5(1, aa). since a = i(ifi),
the heat kernel for aa is obtained from that for aa by changing sign before
fi. therefore, all coecients before odd powers of fi must vanish. thus the
coecient before f 2
mfa,a in a5(1, aa) is zero. as above, s = 0. we compute:

a =

if e is a local invariant, let (e) = tr(e(d,b))  tr(e( d, b)). then
(an(1,))[m] = 0. we compute (e) for the terms appearing in the formula
for a5 contained in 4. we organize these terms into two lemmas to group
the data involved. in lemma a.2, we determine the terms which are bilinear
in a and b or which involve a0a0b2. in lemma a.3, we study terms in a3
and in the jets of b.

let ds2() = e2f ds2 dene a conformal variation.
in this appendix, we
summarize the computation of the conformal variations we needed in section
6. we integrate by parts where necessary to bring the variations into standard
form so that f is not dierentiated with respect to tangential coordinates.
we will be dealing with terms which are homogeneous of order 4. if f is
constant, then d
d|=0x = 4f x. to avoid writing the conformal weight
term repeatedly, we dene lx := d
d x|=0 + 4f x. note that lx = 0 if x
only involves  and  terms; consequently these terms have been omitted in
the interests of brevity.

c appendix

in the proof of lemma 7.1, we used the local index theorem. we list in
this appendix the terms giving non-zero contributions to a5(d[1])  a5(d[0]).
coecients of corresponding invariants are given an the right hand side in
the formulae below. let a comma denote ordinary partial dierentiation.
the terms with f,mf,mmm are dropped since they are not needed for the
calculations. we omit the factor of trv iv .
