abstract

we study intersecting d-branes in type 0 string theories and show that the dp-
brane bound states obey similar intersecting rules as the dp-branes of the type ii
theories. the d5-d1 brane system is studied in detail. we show that the corre-
sponding near-horizon geometry is the ads3  s3  t 4 space and that there is no
tachyon instability in this background. the bekenstein-hawking entropy is calcu-
lated. the worldvolume theory on the d5-d1 system is also studied. this theory
contains both bosons and fermions and it is seen to arise as a projection of the su-
persymmetric gauge theory related to the d5-d1 system of the type iib theory. the
bekenstein-hawking entropy formula is reproduced exactly using the dual conformal
eld theory.

1 introduction

recently there has been a renewed interest in the type 0 string theories [1, 2]. while in
the type ii theories the gso projection acts independently on the left- and right-moving
sectors, in the type 0 theories this projection ties both sectors together. more precisely, this
so-called diagonal gso projection is just (1 + (1)f + f )/2. the resulting string theories
(type 0a and type 0b) have worldsheet supersymmetry but no space-time supersymmetry.
the closed string spectrum is divided in the following sectors (in the notation of [3])

0a :
0b :

(ns, ns)  (ns+, ns+)  (r+, r)  (r, r+) ,
(ns, ns)  (ns+, ns+)  (r+, r+)  (r, r) .

(1.1)

notice that these theories have no fermions in the bulk. the massless bosonic elds are
similar to the type ii theories with the r  r elds doubled. in addition, there is a tachyon
with m2 = 2/ coming from the (ns, ns) sector.

the doubling of the r  r sector in the type 0 theories has some interesting conse-
quences. for each p (even or odd in the 0a or 0b theories, respectively) there are two
(p + 1)-form gauge potentials ap+1 and ap+1 corresponding to the r  r sectors in (1.1).
thus, these theories will have two dierent types of dp-branes and corresponding anti-
branes [4]. it is convenient to redene the gauge elds and corresponding d-brane charges
in the following way [4]

(ap+1) =

1

2 (cid:16)ap+1  ap+1(cid:17) ,

q =

1
2

(q  q) .

(1.2)

in this notation we have dp+-branes, dp-branes and the corresponding anti-branes. a
dp+-brane carries the charges q = 1 = q and a dp-brane the charges q = 1 = q. in the
type 0b theory and for p = 3, the self-dual eld strength f5 = da4 and the anti-self-dual
eld strength f5 = a4 may be combined to form an unconstrained 5-form eld strength.
the d3+-brane will then be electrically charged and the d3-brane magnetically charged.
following a suggestion made by polyakov [5], and the earlier work on the ads/cf t
duality [6, 7, 8], klebanov and tseytlin [4] used the type 0 string theory to study non-
supersymmetric non-conformal gauge theories. in particular, they considered the theory
of n coincident electrically charged d3-branes (d3+-branes). the corresponding eective
worldvolume theory is purely bosonic and tachyon free. more precisely, it is the four-
dimensional u(n) gauge theory with six adjoint scalars.
it was then argued that the
r  r ux in the type 0 dual background stabilizes the tachyon, as expected from the
duality equivalence. since then a few papers reporting results on this model appeared
[9  14] (see also [15, 16, 17] for related work in non-critical strings).

2

in a related development, klebanov and tseytlin [18] also considered the theory of n
d3+-branes coincident with n d3-branes (n coincident d3-branes2). the novelty here
is that the worldvolume theory for this bound state has fermions corresponding to open
strings with one end on a d3+-brane and the other end on a d3-brane. this theory is
the conformal u(n) u(n) gauge theory with six adjoint scalars and eight bifundamental
weyl spinors (four in the (n, n ) plus four in the (n, n)). the dual type 0 background
is the ads5  s5 space. remarkably, the dp-brane bound states of the type 0 theories
share many properties of the bps dp-branes of the type ii theories. in particular, two of
such parallel branes satisfy the no-force condition [4, 18] (see also [12, 19] for details on
the potentials between dierent type 0 dp-branes).

the results described above lead us to consider the problem of intersecting dp-branes
in the type 0 theories. we shall start in section two by studying the forces between
intersecting type 0 d-branes. we conclude that the dp-brane bound states may be
intersected according to the same rules of the type ii theories. in section three we consider
the d5-d1 brane system and show the the corresponding near-horizon geometry is the
ads3  s3  t 4 space. in this background the tachyon eld is stabilized. we calculate the
bekenstein-hawking entropy in terms of the quantized d-brane charges. in section four
we study the worldvolume theory associated to the d5-d1 brane system. this theory
contains fermions corresponding to strings with one end on a dp+-brane and the other end
on a dp
-brane. also, we show that this gauge theory is a z2 projection of the type ii
gauge theory for the d5-d1 brane system, i.e. the compactication to two dimensions of
a n = 1, d = 6 supersymmetric gauge theory [20]. by choosing an appropriate branch
of our gauge theory, we dene the dual conformal eld theory and reproduce exactly the
bekenstein-hawking entropy formula. we present our conclusions in section ve.

2 intersecting d-branes in type 0 string theory

we shall start by reviewing the results presented in [4] for the interacting energy between
parallel d-branes. the type 0 d-branes were earlier studied in [21] by using the boundary
state formalism (see also [22, 23, 24] for related work on the open string descendents of the
type 0b theory). the cylinder amplitude between two likely charged parallel dp-branes
(i.e. between two dp+-branes or two dp-branes) is obtained by omitting the r sector in

2a dp-brane is a bound state of a dp+-brane and a dp-brane; a dp-brane is a bound state of a

dp+-brane and a anti dp-brane; and similar denitions follow for the anti dp- and dp-branes.

(2.1)

where q = et. the rst term in the parenthesis comes from the ns spin structure and the
second term from the ns(1)f spin structure. the open string tachyon is projected out
and the open string states are purely bosonic. in the closed string channel the amplitude
(2.1) is seen to contain a term from the closed string tachyon, a term from the attractive
ns  ns massless exchange and a term from the repulsive r  r massless exchange (which
is twice the ns  ns attractive term because the r  r elds are doubled). the potential
arising from (2.1) is repulsive for short distances and attractive for large ones [12].

to calculate the cylinder amplitude between a dp+-brane and a dp-brane, the correct
projection in the open string channel is to retain the r sector only. the result is minus the
amplitude in (2.1). however, in this case the open strings are associated with fermionic
states. in the closed string channel we have a term from the tachyon and an attractive term
from the ns  ns massless exchange (the r  r contribution to the interacting potential
cancels). the potential between a dp+-brane and a dp-brane is attractive for short
distances and repulsive for large ones [19].

a few interesting results follow from the previous analysis [4]. firstly, the worldvolume
theory of a dp-brane bound state contains fermions arising from strings ending on branes
with dierent charges and bosons arising from strings ending on likely charged branes. sec-
ondly, the cylinder amplitude between two dp-branes may be seen to vanish by adding the
contributions from each constituent. also, because q = 0 for the dp-brane, it decouples
from the bulk tachyon, i.e. it is not a source for such eld (or q = 0 for the dp-brane).

now we turn to the case of intersecting d-branes. we want to calculate the interacting
energy between a dp-brane and a dp-brane in the type 0 theories. this problem is
analogous to the type ii case [25]. the open strings stretching between these branes will
have either dd, nn or nd( dn) boundary conditions. the only t-duality invariant
quantity is the number of directions along which the open strings satisfy nd boundary
conditions because the dd and nn boundary conditions are related by t-duality. taking
into account that the ghost contribution will cancel two of the (dd or nn) coordinates we
have nd = 8  (nn + dd). if nd 6= 0 there are fermionic zero modes in the ns(1)f
sector and therefore this sector will not contribute (as well as the r(1)f sector).

to calculate the cylinder amplitude between + (or ) charged dp- and dp-branes we

4

have to omit the r sector in the open string channel. the result is

(2.2)

where the branes intersect over a l-brane. if nd = 0 (and therefore (nn + dd) = 8) we
obtain the contribution from the ns spin structure in the amplitude (2.1) (to which the
contribution from the ns(1)f spin structure must be added). to factorize the cylinder
in the closed string channel we need to consider the limit t  0. the result is
(cid:16)e/t + (8  2nd) + o(e/t)(cid:17) .

the rst term comes from the closed string tachyon and the second term from the ns  ns
massless exchange. note that the absence of the ns(1)f sector reects the fact that
dierent d-branes do not interact through the r  r gauge elds [25]. note also that the
ns  ns massless exchange vanishes for nd = 4 but the tachyonic term remains.

the cylinder amplitude between a dp+- and a dp

open string r sector only. the result is

(2.5)

comparing with (2.3) we see that the sign of the tachyonic term is reversed while the term
corresponding to the ns  ns massless exchange is the same.

the potential between a dp- and a dp

-brane can be calculated by adding the poten-
tials between the constituents. the result is twice the sum of (2.2) and (2.4). in particular,
for nd = 4 there is no force between these bound states. this is analogous to the type ii
case where for nd = 4 we have a state preserving a fraction of the space-time supersym-
metry, i.e. a stable bps state. in the type ii case we are led to study the d5-d1 brane
system that corresponds to a 5-dimensional black hole in the dual gravitational description
of the system [26, 27]. here we shall study the d5-d1 brane system of the type 0b
theory. the worldvolume theory of such a bound state will contain fermions associated
to open strings with one end on a + charged d-brane and the other end on a  charged

5

d-brane, and bosons associated to strings ending on + charged d-branes or on  charged
d-branes.

finally, we consider the case nd = 8 which deserves a separate discussion3 [25]. in
this case there are no fermionic zero modes in the r(1)f sector which has to be included.
to calculate the amplitude for + (or ) charged dp- and dp-branes we retain the ns
open string sector. the result is

in the remainder of this paper we shall study the d5-d1 brane system. we start by

3recently, and while this work was in progress, a paper considering the intersection of a d5+-brane and
a d5-branes over a string appeared [28]. they used the existence of chiral fermions on the intersection
to derive the anomalous wess-zumino coupling [29] for dp+- and dp-branes.

where i, j, ... = 6, ..., 9 and , , ... are ve-dimensional indices. the eld 6 is the dilaton
eld in the six-dimensional theory. we shall make the following ansatz for the 3-form
eld strengths f3 and ka luza-klein eld a(k)
 : (f3)1 are electric corresponding to
the d1-branes, (f3) are magnetic corresponding to the d5-branes and a(k)
is electric

corresponding to the ka luza-klein modes along x1. the action (3.1) becomes

the rst term in the potential v comes from the tachyon mass, the second term from the

charges. the equations of motion following from the action (3.8) should be supplemented
with the zero energy condition [30]

(3.11)

to nd the solution to the above system rst we consider the tachyon eld. for small
t , we have f+(t )  1/f(t ) and therefore the function h1(t ) has an extremum at t = t0
such that f+(t0) = q1+/q1 [18]. similarly, the function h5(t ) has an extremum at t = t0
such that f+(t0) = q5/q5+. for qi+ = qi  qi (i = 1 or 5) we have f+(t0) = 1 which
is solved by t0 = 0 and it is consistent with the assumption that t is small (more generally
if f+ = f 1
 and f+(0) = 1 the argument will follow, e.g. for f = et ). thus, the tachyon
equation is solved by t = 0. the solution for the dilaton eld 6 becomes 6 = 0 (recall
that 6 has its zero mode subtracted). noting that hi(0) = q2
i , the solution is similar to
the d5-d1 solution of the type iib theory obtained in [30] using the above method. in
terms of the ten-dimensional theory elds we have

next we discuss the issue of stability of the background (3.12). we consider small

(3.15)

asymptotically the background (3.12) is just minkowsky space which is not stable because
of the tachyon eld. however, we are interested in the near-horizon geometry where we
expect the tachyonic instability to be cured. the near-horizon region corresponds to the
limit r  r0 such that the dilute gas condition ri  r0, rk, r holds. in this limit the metric
in (3.12) becomes

this geometry is the product of the btz black hole which is locally ads3 and s3  t 4. in

(3.17)

thus, the tachyon is stabilized for r1r5  4.4 but this is precisely the region where the 
corrections to the gravity approximation are expected to be important. however, because
the ads3 and s3 radii are equal the weyl tensor for this background cancels. assuming
that the  corrections can be written in terms of the weyl tensor we expect this geometry
to be an exact solution of the theory [32]. also, the stability condition for the tachyon
eld is expected to hold [18].

4note that in a ads background tachyons with suciently small negative mass square are allowed [31].

however, this fact does not change the above condition signicantly [18].

9

next we quantize the parameters in the gravitational solution. this can be done by
relating the quanta of d5-brane, d1-brane and ka luza-klein charge with the parameters
r5, r1, r0 and . the result is

n5 = n5 =

(3.18)

where v = (r6...r9)/2. comparing with the type ii case we have an extra factor of
1/2 in the expressions for n5 and n1. notice that the six-dimensional string coupling is
g6 = g/v and that the condition to stabilize the tachyon derived above can be written as
g6n1n5  22.

we are now in position to calculate the bekenstein-hawking entropy in terms of the

quantized charges. the result is

sbh =

r1r5 cosh () = 2q2n1n5(cid:18)qnl +qnr(cid:19) .

we remark that there is an extra factor of 2 in comparison with the type iib case.

(3.19)

4 the d5-d1 worldvolume theory

in this section we study the worldvolume theory of the d5-d1 brane system. our main
goal is to derive the entropy formula (3.19) by considering a specic branch of this theory.
we shall see that the eld theory for the d5-d1 system is a projection of the type iib
eld theory for d5-d1 brane system.

we start by analyzing the worldvolume eld content on the d5-d1 bound state.
however, it is convenient to study instead the eld theory on the t-dual d9-d5 bound
state. as explained in section two, strings with both ends on + charged or  charged
d-branes give worldvolume bosons while strings with one end on a + charged d-brane and
the other end on a  charged d-brane give worldvolume fermions. schematically we may
write

now we show that the gauge theory for the d9-d5 system can be obtained as a
projection of the analogous supersymmetric gauge theory of the type iib theory, i.e. a n =
1, d = 6 supersymmetric gauge theory. we start with two vectormultiplets in the adjoint
of u(2n1) and u(2n5) together with two hypermultiplets in the same representation of
the gauge groups. these elds can be written as a vector gauge eld, two weyl spinors and
four scalars, i.e. (a(5,5)
(9,9)) in the adjoint of u(2n1)
and u(2n5), respectively. this is the eld content of the n = 2, d = 6 supersymmetric
gauge theory that arises from the reduction on t 4 of the n = 1, d = 10 super yang-
mills theory. the theory has another hypermultiplet (, ) where  is a su(2) doublet
describing two complex scalars and  a weyl spinor both transforming in the (2n1, 2n 5)
of u(2n1)  u(2n5).

the d9-d5 eld theory is obtained by a z2 projection of the above theory. we take
the z2 action to be (1)fi where f is the fermionic number and i is the conjugation by
diag(i, i) where i is the n1  n1 or the n5  n5 identity matrix [18]. this projection
breaks the gauge symmetry u(2n1) to u+(n1) u(n1) and u(2n5) to u+(n5) u(n5).
the action of this projection on the elds (a(n,n)
(n,n)) (n = 5, 9) gives the elds
(a(n,n)
(n,n)) of our theory and it is similar to the d3-brane case discussed
in [18]. to determine the action on the hypermultiplet (, ) we decompose these elds in
n1  n5 blocks. the conjugation by i

together with the (1)f action leaves us with the elds ,  and ,  previously discussed.
to calculate the entropy associated with the gravitational background (3.16) we assume
that the dynamics of this black hole is determined by the strings stretching between d1-
and d5-branes. this is analogous to what happens in the type iib case. thus, the
system is described by 2 (4n1n5) massless bosons arising from the elds  and  and by
2(4n1n5) massless fermions arising from the elds  and , where we are considering the
reduction of our gauge theory to two dimensions. hence, we have a conformal eld theory
with central charge c = 2 (4 + 2)n1n5. this eective theory has to be conformal because
of the ads3 character of the dual type 0b background. if we excite this system with nl,r
units of left- and right-moving momentum, we have the usual asymptotic formula for the
entropy

s = sc

(4.3)

which is valid for nl,r  n1n5 and exactly reproduces the result (3.19). the previous
condition may be relaxed by considering winding d-branes [33].

finally, we justify the assumption that the black hole dynamics is determined by open
strings stretching between d1- and d5-branes. we assume that the dual eld theory is
the projection (1)fi of the dual eld theory in the type ii case, i.e. the higgs branch
of the n = 1, d = 6 supersymmetric gauge theory (compactied on t 4) discussed above.
this branch corresponds to exciting the hypermultiplets while the vectormultiplets are in
their vacuum state. to analyze the projected theory we consider for simplicity only the
bosonic degrees of freedom. the d-terms of the original supersymmetric theory become in

where we are using the notation in [20]. the indices a, b, c run over the gauge group

branch is 2  (4n1n5 + 4n 2

the moduli space of vacua. but these are precisely the number of bosons associated with
the open strings stretching between d1- and d5-branes.

it is interesting to relate the above description to the instanton moduli space approx-
imation of [26].
in the latter description we view the d1-branes as instantons in the
d5-branes gauge theory. this theory is the u+(n5)  u(n5) six-dimensional gauge the-
ory with four adjoint scalars and four bifundamental weyl spinors (two in the (n5, n 5)
and two in the (n 5, n5)). the n1 d1-branes are seen as instantons in this gauge theory
with instanton number  = n1+ + n1 = 2n1. our results predict that the moduli space
of these instantons is given by a conformal eld theory with 2 (4n1n5) species of bosons
and 2  (4n1n5) species of fermions, i.e. with central charge c = 12n1n5.

5 conclusion

let us start by summarizing the results presented in this paper. we started by considering
intersecting d-branes in type 0 string theory. we calculated the cylinder amplitudes for
intersecting dp- and dp-branes by using the result that open strings terminating on +
(or ) charged d-branes give worldvolume bosons while open strings terminating on a +
charged d-brane and on a  charged d-brane give worldvolume fermions. we concluded
that the intersecting rules for the dp-brane bound states are identical to the intersecting
rules for the d-branes of the type ii theories. in the remainder of this paper we analyzed in
detail the d5-d1 brane system of the type 0b theory. we showed that the near-horizon
geometry for this d-brane bound state is the ads3  s3  t 4 space (the ads3 factor may

13

be replaced by the btz black hole) which was argued to be a stable and exact solution
of the type 0b gravitational equations. we proceeded by describing the worldvolume eld
theory on this d-brane system. it turned out that this gauge theory is a z2 projection of
the analogous theory for the d5-d1 brane system of the type iib theory. by projecting the
higgs branch of the latter theory we correctly reproduced the bekenstein-hawking entropy
formula calculated in the gravitational analysis.

finally, we note that because the rules for intersecting the dp-brane bound states are
the same as for the type ii theories, there are many results that are expected to hold in
the type 0 theories.
in particular, we expect to have d = 4 black holes corresponding
to other intersecting dp-branes, e.g. the triple intersection of d3-branes over a string
along which momentum is carried [34]. also, we expect to have rotating black holes [35].
furthermore, we expect that more generally the dp-branes can intersect at su(n) angles
[36]. the corresponding gravitational background can be derived by using the results in
refs. [37, 38, 39]. also, there should be bound states of branes with constant worldvolume
magnetic elds and corresponding black hole solutions [40].
