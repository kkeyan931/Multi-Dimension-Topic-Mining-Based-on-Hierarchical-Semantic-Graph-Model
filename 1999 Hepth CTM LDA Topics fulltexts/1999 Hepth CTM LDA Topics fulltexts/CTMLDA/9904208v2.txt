we consider null bosonic p-branes in curved space-times. some exact solutions of

the classical equations of motion and of the constraints for the null membrane in gen-

eral stationary, axially symmetrical, four dimensional, gravity background are found.

1 introduction

the null (tensionless) p-branes correspond to usual p-branes with their tension tp

taken to be zero. this relationship between null p-branes and the tensionful ones may

be regarded as a generalization of the massless-massive particles correspondence. the

dynamics of the null branes in curved backgrounds is interesting also as a generalization

of the motion of null strings in such backgrounds [1], [2], [3], [4], [5].

a model for null p-branes living in friedmann-robertson-walker space-time (with

k = 0) was proposed in [6]. the motion equations were solved and it was shown there

that an ideal uid of null p-branes may be considered as a source of gravity.

here we investigate the classical evolution of the null branes in a curved background.

in sec. 2 we give the corresponding lagrangian formulation. in sec. 3 the brst-bfv

approach in its hamiltonian version is applied to the considered dynamical system. in

sec. 4 some exact solutions of the equations of motion and of the constraints for the

null membrane in general stationary, axially symmetrical, four dimensional, gravity

background are found. the examples of minkowski, de sitter, schwarzschild, taub-

nut and kerr space-times are considered in sec. 5. sec. 6 is devoted to comments

and conclusions.

2 lagrangian formulation

the action for the bosonic null p-brane in a d-dimensional curved space-time

with metric tensor g(x) can be written in the form:

s = z dp+1l

,

l = v j v kj xkxg(x),

(1)

j = /j ,

j = (0, j) = (, j),

j, k = 0, 1, ..., p

,

j, k = 1, ..., p

,

,  = 0, 1, ..., d  1.

it is an obvious generalization of the at space-time action given in [7].

to prove the invariance of the action under innitesimal dieomorphisms on the

world volume (reparametrizations), we rst write down the corresponding transforma-

2

tion law for the (r,s)-type tensor density of weight a

t j1...jr

k1...ks[a] = lt j1...jr

k1...ks[a] = llt j1...jr

 t jj2...jr
+ at j1...jr

k1...ks [a]j j1  ...  t j1...jr1j
k1...ks[a]ll,

k1...ks

[a]j jr

where l is the lie derivative along the vector eld . using (2), one veries that if

x(), g() are world-volume scalars (a = 0) and v j () is a world-volume (1,0)-type

tensor density of weight a = 1/2, then j x is a (0,1)-type tensor, j xkxg is a

(0,2)-type tensor and l is a scalar density of weight a = 1. therefore,

s = z dp+1j (jl)

and this variation vanishes under suitable boundary conditions.

the equations of motion following from (1) are:

j(cid:16)v j v kkx(cid:17) + 

v j v kj xkx = 0,

v j j xkxg(x) = 0,

where 

 is the connection compatible with the metric g(x):



 =

1
2

g(g + g  g).

for the transition to hamiltonian picture it is convenient to rewrite the lagrangian

density (1) in the form ( = /, j = /j ):

l =

1
40 g(x)(  jj)x(  kk)x,

(3)

3

where

v j = (v 0, v j) =  

1
20

,

j

20!.

now the equation of motion for x takes the form:

20 (  kk)xi  jh j
h 1

20 (  kk)xi
(  jj)x(  kk)x = 0.

+

20 

(4)

the equations of motion for the lagrange multipliers 0 and j which follow from (3)

give the constraints :

g(x)(  jj)x(  kk)x = 0,
g(x)(  kk)xjx = 0.

(5)

in terms of x and the conjugated momentum p they read:

t0 = g(x)pp = 0

,

tj = pjx = 0.

(6)

3 hamiltonian formulation

the hamiltonian which corresponds to the lagrangian density (3) is a linear

combination of the constraints (6) :

h0 = z dp(0t0 + jtj).

they satisfy the following (equal  ) poisson bracket algebra

{t0(1), t0(2)} = 0,

4

{t0(1), tj(2)} = [t0(1) + t0(2)]jp(1  2),
{tj(1), tk(2)} = [l
 = (1, ..., p).

ktj(2)]lp(1  2),

jtk(1) + l

(7)

the equalities (7) show that the constraint algebra is the same for at and for curved

backgrounds. having in mind the above algebra, one can construct the corresponding

brst charge  [8] (*=complex conjugation)

 = min + j p j ,

{, } = 0,

 = .

(8)

min in (8) can be written as [9]

min = z dp{t00 + tjj + p0[(jj)0 + (j0)j] + pk(jk)j},

and can be represented also in the form

min = z dp[(t0 +

1
2

t gh
0 )0 + (tj +

1
2

t gh

j )j] +z dpj(cid:16)1

2pkkj(cid:17).

here a superscript gh is used for the ghost part of the total gauge generators

j = {,pj} = {min,pj} = tj + t gh
t tot
j .

we recall that the poisson bracket algebras of t tot

j and tj coincide for rst rank systems

which is the case under consideration. the manifest expressions for t gh

j are:

t gh
0 = 2p0jj + (jp0)j,
t gh
j = 2p0j0 + (jp0)0 + pjkk + pkjk + (kpj)k.

up to now, we introduced canonically conjugated ghosts (j ,pj ), (j , p j ) and mo-
menta j for the lagrange multipliers j in the hamiltonian. they have poisson

5

brackets and grassmann parity as follows (j is the grassmann parity of the corre-

sponding constraint):

{j,pk} = j
k,
{j , p k} = (1)j k k
j ,
{j, k} = j
k,

(j ) = (j ) = j .

(j ) = (pj ) = j + 1,

(j ) = ( p j ) = j + 1,

the brst-invariant hamiltonian is

h  = h min + { , } = { , },

(9)

because from hcanonical = 0 it follows h min = 0. in this formula  stands for the gauge

xing fermion (  =  ). we use the following representation for the latter

 = min + j (j +

1
2

(j)j ),

min = jpj ,

where (j) are scalar parameters and we have separated the j -dependence from j . if

we adopt that j does not depend on the ghosts (j ,pj ) and (j , p j ), the hamiltonian
h  from (9) takes the form

h  = h min

 + pj p j  j (j +

1
2

(j)j ) +

(10)

where

+ j{j , tk}k,

 = {min, min}.
h min

one can use the representation (10) for h  to obtain the corresponding brst

invariant lagrangian density

l  = l + lgh + lgf .

6

here l is given in (3), lgh stands for the ghost part and lgf - for the gauge xing

part of the lagrangian density. the manifest expressions for lgh and lgf are [9]:

lgh =  0 0   j j + 0[2 0jj + (j 0)j]
+j[2 0j0 + (j 0)0 +  kjk +  jkk + (k j)k]

+z dp{ 0()[{t0, 0()}0 + {tj, 0()}j]
+ j()[{t0, j()}0 + {tk, j()}k]},
( j  j)( j  j).

2(j)

( 0  0)( 0  0) +

lgf =

2(0)

if one does not intend to pass to the lagrangian formalism, one may restrict oneself

to the minimal sector (min, min, h min



).

in particular, this means that lagrange

multipliers are not considered as dynamical variables anymore. with this particular

gauge choice, h min



is a linear combination of the total constraints

h min

 = z dph0t tot

0 () + jt tot

j ()i,

and we can treat here the lagrange multipliers 0, j as constants. of course, this

does not x the gauge completely.

4 null membranes in d=4

here we conne ourselves to the case of membranes moving in a four dimensional,

stationary, axially symmetrical, gravity background of the type

ds2 = g00(dx0)2 + g11(dx1)2 + g22(dx2)2 + g33(dx3)2 + 2g03dx0dx3,

(11)

g = g(x1, x2).

7

we will work in the gauge 0, j = constants, in which the equations of motion (4)

and constraints (5) for the membrane (j, k = 1, 2) have the form:

(  jj)(  kk)x + 

(  jj)x(  kk)x = 0.
g(x)(  jj)x(  kk)x = 0,
g(x)(  kk)xjx = 0.

(12)

(13)

to establish the correspondence with the null geodesics we note that if we introduce

the quantities

u(x) = (  jj)x,

(14)

the equations of motion (12) can be rewritten as

u(u + 

u) = 0.

then it follows from here that u2 do not depend on x. in this notations, the constraints

are:

guu = 0

,

gujx = 0.

taking into account the metric (11), one can write the equations of motion (12)

and the constraints (13) in the form:

(  jj)u0 + 2(cid:16)0
+2(cid:16)0
(  jj)(  kk)x1 + 1

g11(  kk)x1jx1 + g22(  kk)x2jx2 +
+(g00jx0 + g03jx3)u0 + (g03jx0 + g33jx3)u3 = 0,

where the notation introduced in (14) is used. to simplify these equations, we make

the ansatz

x0(, ) = f 0(z1, z2) + t( ),

x1(, ) = r( )

,

x2(, ) = ( ),

(16)

x3(, ) = f 3(z1, z2) + ( ),

zj = j + j,

where f 0, f 3 are arbitrary functions of their arguments.

after substituting (16) in (15), we receive (the dot is used for dierentiation with

respect to the ane parameter  ):

u0 +h(cid:16)g001g00 + g031g03(cid:17) u0 +(cid:16)g001g03 + g031g33(cid:17) u3i r

 + 2g22

2g22

(g00jf 0 + g03jf 3)u0 + (g03jf 0 + g33jf 3)u3 = 0.

if we choose

f 0(z1, z2) = f 0(w)

,

f 3(z1, z2) = f 3(w),

(18)

(19)

(20)

(21)

(22)

where w = w(z1, z2) is an arbitrary function of z1 and z2, then the system of equations

(22) reduces to the single equation

df 0

(cid:16)g00

+ g03

df 3

dw(cid:17)u0 +(cid:16)g03

df 0

+ g33

df 3

dw(cid:17)u3 = 0.

(23)

to be able to separate the variables u0, u3 in the system of dierential equations

(17), (20) with the help of (23), we impose the following condition on f 0(w) and f 3(w)

f 0(w) = c 0f [w(z1, z2)]

,

f 3(w) = c 3f [w(z1, z2)],

where c 0, c 3 are constants, and f (w) is an arbitrary function of w. then the solution

of (17), (20) and (23) is [4] (c1 = const):

u0( ) = c1(cid:16)c 0g03 + c 3g33(cid:17) exp(h),

10

u3( ) = +c1(cid:16)c 0g00 + c 3g03(cid:17) exp(h),
h = z (cid:16)g00dg00 + 2g03dg03 + g33dg33(cid:17).

the condition for the compatibility of (24) with (18), (19) and (21) is:

u0( ) = c1(cid:16)c 0g03 + c 3g33(cid:17) h1

= c1(cid:16)c 3g00  c 0g03(cid:17) = t( ),

u3( ) = +c1(cid:16)c 0g00 + c 3g03(cid:17) h1

= c1(cid:16)c 3g03  c 0g33(cid:17) = ( ),

h = g00g33  g2
03.

on the other hand, from (19) and (21) one has:

r2 = g11hc 2

in obtaining (27), we have used the gauge freedom in the metric (11), to impose the

condition [10]:

2  g22

g11! = 0.

as a nal result we have

x0 = c 0f [w(z1, z2)] + t( ),

x1 = r( ),

x2 = ( ),

x3 = c 3f [w(z1, z2)] + ( ),

where t( ), r( ), ( ), ( ) are given by (25), (26), and (27).

in the particular case when x2 =  = 0 = const, one can integrate to obtain

the following exact solution of the equations of motion and constraints for the null

5 examples

here we give some examples of solutions of the type received in the previous

section. to begin with, let us start with the simplest case of minkowski space-time.

the metric is

g00 = 1,

g11 = 1,

g22 = r2,

g33 = r2 sin2 ,

and equalities (25), (26), (27) take the form:

our next example is the de sitter space-time. we take the metric in the form

g00 = (cid:16)1  kr2(cid:17) , g11 = (cid:16)1  kr2(cid:17)1

, g22 = r2, g33 = r2 sin2 ,

where k is the constant curvature. now we have

now let us turn to the case of schwarzschild space-time. the corresponding metric

may be written as

g00 = (1  2mr1)
g22 = r2

,

g33 = r2 sin2 ,

,

g11 = (1  2mr1)1,

where m is the schwarzschild mass. the equalities (25), (26) and (27) read

6 comments and conclusions

in the previous section we restrict ourselves to some particular cases of the

generic solution (28) and do not pay attention to the existing possibilities for obtaining

solutions in the case  6= const in the considered examples.

obviously, the examples given in sec.5 do not exhaust all possibilities contained

in the metric (11) [11]. on the other hand, in dierent particular cases of this type

of metric, there exist more general brane solutions. they will be published elsewhere.

here we only mention that in the gauge k = const,

x(, ) = x(k + k)

is an obvious nontrivial solution of the equations of motion and of the constraints (4),

(5) depending on d arbitrary functions of p variables for the null p-brane in arbitrary

d-dimensional gravity background.

from the results of the previous sections, it is easy to extract the corresponding

formulas for the null string case simply by putting 1 = , 1 = , 2 = 2 = 0. for

example, our equalities (29) coincide with the ones obtained in [3] for the null string

moving in schwarzschild space-time after identication:

e = c1c 3,

l = c1c 0,

l2 + k = c2.

moreover, our solution (30) in the case p = 1, generalizes the solution given in [4]. the

17

latter corresponds to xing the arbitrary function f (w) to a linear one and xing the

gauge to  = 0, i.e.

f [w(1 + 1, 2 + 2)] 7 f ( + ) =  + ,

with

 = 0.

in this paper we perform some investigation on the classical dynamics of the null

bosonic branes in curved background. in the second section we give the action, prove

its reparametrization invariance and give the equations of motion and constraints in an

arbitrary gauge. then we construct the corresponding hamiltonian and compute the

constraint algebra. following [8], we obtain the manifest expressions for the classical

brst charge, the total constraints, the brst invariant hamiltonian and the brst

invariant lagrangian. all this gives the possibility for quantization of the null p-

branes in a curved space-time. in the fourth section we consider the dynamics of the

null membranes (p = 2) in a four dimensional, stationary, axially symmetrical, gravity

background. some exact solutions of the equations of motion and of the constraints are

found there. the next section is devoted to examples of such solutions in minkowski,

de sitter, schwarzschild, taub-nut and kerr space-times.
