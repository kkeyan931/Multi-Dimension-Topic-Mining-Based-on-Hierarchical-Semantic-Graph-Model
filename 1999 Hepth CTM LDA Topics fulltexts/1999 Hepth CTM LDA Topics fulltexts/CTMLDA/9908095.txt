(the vanishing bilinear consequence two unbroken u(1) symmetries.) thus seems possible asymptotic metric might exact case, analysis required show actually so. begin, need several properties moduli space hold whether monopoles distinct species. counting zero modes, know n -monopole moduli space 4n -dimensional manifold. three coordinates taken position center-of-mass. center-of- mass motion constant independent behavior variables, moduli space 8it deformations due interactions prevent solutions two separated su(2) monopoles axial symmetric. 23 factored product three-dimensional space spanned center-of-mass coordinates (4n 5)-dimensional manifold. latter factored, least locally, product r1, corresponding overall phase unbroken u(1) generated h h, (4n 4)-dimensional manifold depending relative coordinates phases.9 furthermore, relation zero modes expressed eq.

(6.9), together fact h 2 = 0, shows embedding simple gives vacuum. finally, third embedding, using 1 + 2, gives solution gauge-equivalent 1-embedding, hence also four zero modes. last result particularly puzzling think nonmaximal breaking limiting case maximal symmetry breaking. eight zero modes suddenly converted four? one way understand follow behavior three embedding solutions maximally broken case h 2 approaches zero. 1-solution independent h 2, neither normalizable zero modes aected. 2-solution exists (with four normalizable zero modes) nite value h 2, core radius steadily increases, elds xed point tend toward vacuum values, h 2 0. although mass core radius (1 + 2)-solution approach values 1-monopole, nothing particularly dramatic happens solution itself. zero modes another matter. four  lie entirely within su(2) subgroup dened 1 + 2 remain normalizable. four modes correspond spatial separations two component monopoles hence grow spatial extent radius 2-monopole increases; growth, consequent divergence spatial innity, makes modes nonnormalizable limit nonmaximal breaking. many zero modes would symmetry considerations led us expect? usually, one zero mode symmetry vacuum symmetry soliton. since 1-monopole invariant unbroken su(2), one might rst expect nd three su(2) modes addition three translational one u(1) mode maximally broken 27 fundamental monopole, total seven. u(1) subgroup, generated linear combination one su(2) generator original u(1) generator , leaves monopole invariant, reduced six. however, clear su(2) modes cannot normalizable, since su(2) rotation aects 1/r tail vector potential.10 also use try use index theory methods count zero modes. generalization su(2) calculation gives 2i = 6 either 1- (1 + 2)-monopole, agreement naive symmetry arguments. however, 2i equal number normalizable zero modes contribution continuum spectrum eq.
