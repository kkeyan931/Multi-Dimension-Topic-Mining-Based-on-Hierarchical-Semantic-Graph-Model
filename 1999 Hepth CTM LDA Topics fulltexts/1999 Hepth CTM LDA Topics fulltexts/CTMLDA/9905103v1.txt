abstract

an innite series of grassmann-odd and grassmann-even ow equations is dened
for a class of supersymmetric integrable hierarchies associated with loop superal-
gebras. all these ows commute with the mutually commuting bosonic ones origi-
nally considered to dene these hierarchies and, hence, provide extra fermionic and
bosonic symmetries that include the built-in n = 1 supersymmetry transformation.
the corresponding non-local conserved quantities are also constructed. as an ex-
ample, the particular case of the principal supersymmetric hierarchies associated
with the ane superalgebras with a fermionic simple root system is discussed in
detail.

1 introduction

arguably, one of the most important works in the subject of integrable systems was
that of drinfeld and sokolov [1], who showed how to associate integrable hierarchies of
zero-curvature equations with the loop algebra of an ane lie algebra. their construction
and its generalizations [2] provide a systematic approach to the study and classication
of many integrable hierarchies previously described by means of pseudo-dierential lax
operators [3].

it is not dicult to extend the generalized drinfeld-sokolov construction to the case
of superalgebras. one simply has to replace the loop algebra by a loop superalgebra and
include fermionic (grassmann-odd) anticommuting elds among the dynamical degrees
of freedom. however, the resulting hierarchy will not necessarily be supersymmetric.
the rst authors who succeeded in nding a supersymmetric generalization of the ds
construction were inami and kanno [4] who restricted to the class of ane superalgebras
with a fermionic simple root system. since they made use of the principal gradation
of the loop superalgebra in an essential way, their work has to be viewed as the direct
generalization of the original ds construction. more recently, delduc and gallot [5]
realized that it is possible to associate a supersymmetric integrable hierarchy of the ds
type with each constant graded odd element  of the loop superalgebra whose square
 = [, ]/2 is semi-simple, a condition that is obviously satised in the cases considered
by inami and kanno.

a common feature of the hierarchies constructed in [4] and [5] is that they consist only
of bosonic ow equations. this is in sharp contrast with the supersymmetric extensions
of the kp hierarchy (skp) which always include both grassmann-odd and grassmann-
even ow equations [6]. this observation led kersten to nd and innite set of fermionic
non-local conservation laws [7] for the supersymmetric extension of the kdv equation
obtained by manin and radul as a reduction of the skp hierarchy [6]. a few years later,
dargis and mathieu showed that they actually generate an innite sequence of non-local
grassmann-odd ows [8] (see also [9]).

the aim of this paper is to show that the same is true for the whole class of super-
symmetric hierarchies of [5] by constructing an innite series of non-local (bosonic and
fermionic) ow equations and conserved quantities which generalize those obtained in [7, 8]
for the supersymmetric kdv equation. the new ows close a non-abelian superalgebra
that has to be regarded as an algebra of symmetry transformations for the hierarchy. it
includes the built-in n = 1 supersymmetry transformation and, in some cases, extended
supersymmetry transformations.

following ref. [5], a generalized supersymmetric hierarchy of equations can be asso-
ciated with a fermionic lax operator of the form l = d + q(x, ) + , where q(x, ) is
an n = 1 grassmann-odd supereld taking values in a particular subspace of the loop
superalgebra, d is the superderivative, and  is a constant graded odd element whose
square  = [, ]/2 is semi-simple. delduc and gallot dened an innite set of mutually
commuting bosonic ows and conserved quantities associated with the elements in the
centre of k = ker(ad ), which contains only even elements. in contrast, in our construc-
tion, there will be a non-local ow equation and conserved quantity for each (fermionic
or bosonic) element in k with non-negative grade. these ows close a non-abelian su-
peralgebra isomorphic to the subalgebra of k formed by the elements with non-negative
grade.

the authors of [2] distinguished between (bosonic) generalized ds hierarchies of type-i
and type-ii. the generalized ds hierarchies are associated with bosonic lax operators of
the form l = x + q(x)  , where q(x) is a bosonic eld taking values in a subspace
of a loop algebra and  is a constant semi-simple graded element. then, the hierarchy is
of type-i or type-ii depending on whether  is regular or not, i.e., a type-ii hierarchy is
associated with a semi-simple element  such that k = ker(ad ) is non-abelian. in [5],
the analogue of l is the even lax operator [ l, l]/2 = d2 + q(x, )  . therefore,
from this point of view, all the supersymmetric hierarchies of [5] have to be considered as
type-ii:  is in k but [, ] = 2 6= 0, which proves that k is non-abelian. in fact, it
is straightforward to extend our construction of non-local ow equations and conserved
quantities to all the type-ii bosonic hierarchies of [2].

the paper is organized as follows. in section 2 we briey summarize the supersym-
metric hierarchies of delduc and gallot, making particular emphasis on the possibility of
having fermionic local conserved quantities. in the next two sections we present the con-
struction of non-local ows, sec. 3, and conserved quantities, sec. 4. we also characterise
the ows which are compatible with the supersymmetry transformation, and the conserved
quantities which are supersymmetric. as an example, in section 5 we give a very detailed
description of the non-local ows and conserved quantities for the principal hierarchies
originally considered by inami and kanno, i.e., those associated with superalgebras with
a fermionic simple root system. we show that the complete set of local and non-local
ow equations are associated with a subalgebra of the superoscillator algebra constructed
by kac and van de leur in [10], which is the principal super heisenberg algebra of
a| [11]. this relationship generalizes the well known role of the principal heisenberg
algebra in the original ds hierarchies, which could be used to derive a  -function formal-
ism for these hierarchies following the method of [12, 13, 14] and, especially, to construct
solutions for the equations of the hierarchy using super vertex operator representations.
it is also remarkable that, in the particular case of the ane superalgebras a(m, m)(1),
there is a local grassmann-odd ow d1 that, together with d, closes an n = 2 super-
symmetry algebra, in agreement with the results of [15, 5]. in section 6 we apply our
construction to the supersymmetric kdv equation in order to show how the results of [8]
are recovered. as a bonus, we get additional non-local conserved quantities not obtained
in previous works. our conventions and some basic properties of lie superalgebras are
presented in appendix b. since we are not aware of any reference where they are available,
we have included in this appendix detailed expressions for the matrix-representations of
the ane lie superalgebras with fermionic simple root systems which are needed for the
understanding of section 5. recall that this class of superalgebras play an important role
in supersymmetric toda theories and supersymmetric hamiltonian reduction and, hence,
these expressions should be useful beyond the scope of this paper. our conclusions are
presented in section 7.

2 review of the delduc-gallot construction

following [5], a supersymmetric (partially modied) kdv system can be associated

with four data (a, d1, d0, ). the rst, a, is a twisted loop superalgebra

a = l(g,  )  g  c[, 1]

(2.1)

2

attached to a nite dimensional classical lie superalgebra g together with an automor-
phism  of nite order. the second and third, d1 and d0, are derivations of a that induce
two compatible integer gradations: [d0, d1] = 0 . then, the subsets an
m = am  an, where
am = {x  a | [d0, x] = mx} and an = {x  a | [d1, x] = nx}, dene a bi-grading
of a. we will assume that

a<0  a0, a0  a0, a>0  a0 ,

(2.2)

which means, in the notation of [5], that we restrict ourselves to the kdv type systems.
finally,  is a constant odd element of a with positive d1-grade, i.e., [d1, ] = k

with k > 0, whose square  = 1

2 [, ] is semi-simple:

moreover,  has to satisfy the non-degeneracy condition 1

a = ker(ad )  im(ad ) .

ker(ad )  a<0

0 = 0 ,

and it is worth recalling that

(2.3)

(2.4)

[ker(ad ), ker(ad )]  ker(ad ) ,

[ker(ad ), im(ad )]  im(ad ) .

(2.5)

therefore, ker(ad ) is a, generally non-abelian, subalgebra of a and we will denote by
z its centre, which contains only even elements of a.

the dynamical degrees of freedom will be superelds taking values in the tensor prod-
uct a of a with some grassmann algebra gr = gr0  gr1. an element in this space
is called even if it belongs to +a = a0  gr0  a1  gr1, and odd if it belongs to
a = a0  gr1  a1  gr0. let t a be a set of basis vectors of a. then, the (super)

commutator of two elements a =pa aat a and b =pa bat a of a will be dened as

[a, b] =xa,b

aabb[t a, t b] ,

(2.6)

where aa, bb  gr. with this denition, the commutator satises the symmetry proper-
ties listed in table 1, where we denote by  (hat) the automorphism of a that changes the
sign of odd elements:

m = m0 + m1  a ,

m = m0  m1 .

(2.7)

consider an n = 1 superspace with coordinates x = (x, ) with the supersymmetric

covariant derivative dened in the usual way:

d =




+ 


x

,

d2 =


x

.

then, let us introduce the odd lax operator

l = d + q +  ,

(2.8)

(2.9)

1notice that our non-degeneracy condition implies that ker(ad )  a<0

0 = 0, which is the non-
degeneracy condition mentioned in [5]. however, the latter is unnecessarily more restrictive that the
former.

table 1: symmetry properties of the supercommutator.

where q = q(x) is an odd supereld that takes values in a<k
l we can obtain the following even operator

0. from the odd lax operator

where the even supereld

l =

2

[ l, l] =  + q   ,

q = q(x) = dq +

2

[q, q]  [, q]

takes values in +a<2k
0 .

the phase space of the hierarchy will be q/n , where

q = {q(x) | q(x)  a<k
0}

and n is the group of gauge transformations e acting on q according to

e : l 7 ele

(2.10)

(2.11)

(2.12)

(2.13)

for any supereld  = (x) taking values in +a<0
a such that

0 . let us dene a vector subspace v of

a<k

0 = [, a<0

0 ]  v .

(2.14)

then, due to the non-degeneracy condition (2.4), for any q  q there is a unique q-
dependent gauge transformation such that the image qv = qv (x) is in

qv = {q(x) | q(x)  v } ;

(2.15)

in other words, qv is isomorphic to q/n . when regarded as functions of q  q, the
components of qv are super-dierential polynomials that freely generate the set of gauge
invariant polynomials on q, and qv is said to specify a drinfeld-sokolov gauge.

the construction of [5] relies on the following version of the dressing procedure:

lemma 1 for any q  q, there exists a unique f  +(im(ad))<0 such that

l0 = e f lef = d +  + h ,

(2.16)

where h  (ker(ad ))<k. moreover, the components of f and h are super-dierential
polynomials of q.

this result is used to dene an innite number of commuting ows on q/n associated
with the elements of z 0 as follows. for each constant b  z 0, let us dene the even

4

supereld bb = e f be f . then, the ow on the space of gauge invariant functionals of q
is induced by 2


tb

q = bq = [p0(bb), l] = [p<0(bb), l]

= [r(bb), l] ,

(2.17)

where p0 and p<0 are the projectors on the subalgebras a0 and a<0, respectively, and
r = 1

2(p0  p<0) is a (super) classical r-matrix.

in the following, it will be useful to introduce the notation k = ker(ad ). let us

consider the evolution of h in (2.16), which reads

bh = d ab + [ab,  + h] ,

(2.18)

where ab is a super-dierential polynomial of q taking values in k<0. following the work

of inami and kanno [4], let ek be a vector subspace of k such that

k = [k, k]  ek .

(2.19)

then, an innite set of local conservation laws can be associated with the components of

h in ek. to be precise, let [k, k] = {b  k | h[k, k], bi = 0}. since the restriction of
the bilinear form to k is non-degenerate, [k, k] is conjugate to ek with respect to h, i.

then, for each   [k, k] there is a local conservation law

bh, hi = dh, abi.

(2.20)

a particular subset of [k, k] is z, the centre of k, which obviously satises h[k, k], zi =

0 due to the invariance of the bilinear form. therefore, since z contains only even el-
ements of a, the components of h corresponding to z provide an innite set of even
local conserved quantities, which are the hamiltonians corresponding to the ows dened
by (2.17). namely, for b  z 0,

hb(q) =z dxhb, hi

(2.21)

is the hamiltonian that generates the ow /tb [5].

however, in general, it is not true that z = [k, k] or, in other words, that z and

ek are conjugate with respect to h, i. consequently, eq. (2.20) might provide more local

conservation laws than those associated with z and given by (2.21). in particular, and in
contrast with z, the vector subspace [k, k] can contain odd elements of a and, then,
eq. (2.20) would provide grassmann-odd local conserved quantities.

all this suggest that it should be possible to generalize the construction of [5] to
dene new ows associated somehow with the elements of [k, k] that are not in z. in
particular, it should be possible to dene fermionic ows associated with the odd elements
of [k, k].

2since the ows are dened on the set of gauge invariant functions of q(x), there are many equivalent
denitions of bq corresponding to the same ow. namely, one can take bq = [r(bb) + , l], where  is
an arbitrary supereld in +a<0
0

that generates an innitesimal gauge transformation.

5

3 non-local ows

in this section, we will associate ow equations with all the elements of k = ker(ad).
in general, these equations will be non local, i.e., the evolution of q will not be given by
a super-dierential polynomial of q. moreover, instead of commuting among themselves,
the resulting ows will close a non-abelian superalgebra isomorphic to k0.

3.1 formal dressing transformations

our construction makes use of a dierent version of the formal dressing method
inspired by the work of wilson on the tau-function approach to hierarchies of kdv
type [13, 12]. first of all, for any supereld   +k<0, notice that the transformation

ef  ef 

= eef

in eq. (2.16) is equivalent to

l0  el0e = d +  + h  ,

which does not change the form of the right-hand side of (2.16).

(3.1)

(3.2)

proposition 1 the lax operator l can be constrained to ensure the existence of an
even supereld   +k<0 such that

e(d +  + h)e = d +  .

(3.3)

the supereld  is a non-local functional of q, and the constraints involve the components
of h in kk.

since the proof is quite involved, it will be presented in appendix a.

it is not easy to give the precise form of the constraints on h k required by propo-
sition 1. however, their nature can be claried by considering the transformation (3.3)
acting on the even lax operator

l0 =

1
2

[ l0, l0] =  + h   ,

h = dh +

[ h, h]  [, h] .

(3.4)

1
2

then, eq. (3.3) implies

e( + h  )e =   

(3.5)

that manifests the constraints h0 = 0, which are well known in the context of the tau-
function approach to (bosonic) hierarchies of kdv type [12].

the relation between the latter constraints and those required by proposition 1 can
be explicitly shown for a hierarchy where the d1-grade of  is k = 1. then, according
to (3.4),

h1 = [, h 0]
1
2

h0 = dh 0 +

[ h 0, h 0]  [, h 1] = [, h 1] ,

(3.6)

6

where h  is dened in appendix a by eq. (a.8). in this case, and according to eqs. (a.4)
and (a.9), the constraints required by proposition 1 are

h 0   = im(ad)  k,

h 1   = ker(ad) ,

while h0 = 0 is equivalent to

h 0, h 1   .

(3.7)

(3.8)

since   , the former conditions imply the latter. however, in general  6=  and,
thus, the constraints h0 = 0 are less restrictive than those required by proposition 1.

a particular case where proposition 1 is satised without introducing any constraint

is given by the following

lemma 2 if the d1-grade of  is k = 1 and k0 = {0}, proposition 1 is satised without
constraining the lax operator at all.

proof: in this case, since h 0 = 0, the only constraint would be h 1  . however, since
[, h 1]  k0 = {0}, it is obviously satised.

this lemma applies to all the principal hierarchies that will be consider in the next
sections.

lemma 1 and proposition 1 ensure that the lax operator l can be constrained such

that

where

l = d + q +  = 1

l (d + )l ,

l = eef .

(3.9)

(3.10)

consider the group of gauge transformations given by (2.13). a useful gauge xing pre-
scription (dierent from the drinfeld-sokolov gauge) is provided by the following

lemma 3 a consistent gauge slice can be chosen such that

where  = ey and y = y(x) is an even supereld taking values in +a<0.

el = d + eq +  = 1(d + ) ,

(3.11)

proof: first of all, notice that the gauge transformations (2.13) act on (3.9) according to
l  le. moreover, l = eyl and yl  +a<0. then, taking into account (2.2),
one can perform a gauge transformation generated by l = p0(yl) to construct

 = lel = eef ep0(f )ep0() ,

(3.12)

which proves the lemma.

7

3.2 the ow equations

eq. (3.11) provides a one-to-one map between the components of the (gauged xed)
lax operator and some components of  and, in our construction, the ows will be dened
as ow equations for .

let u be a constant element in +k0, du = 0, and dene the innitesimal transfor-

mation 3

(3.13)
since u  +k0, it has to be of the form u = eb + , where b  k0  a0,   k0  a1,
e  gr0, and   gr1. then, the innitesimal transformation can be written as

u = (1u)<0 .

u = edb + d ,

(3.14)

which provides the following ow equations

denition 1 the ow equations associated with b  k0  a0 and   k0  a1 are
dened by

d =  ( 1)<0 ,
where db and d are bosonic and grassmann derivatives, respectively.

db = (1b)<0 ,

(3.15)

these ows do not commute among themselves.

instead, they close the following

superalgebra.

theorem 1 for any b, c  k0,

[db, dc] = d[c,b] .

(3.16)

proof: let us consider the innitesimal transformations corresponding to two elements
u, v in +k0. then,

uv = (cid:18)(1u)<0(1v)<0 + [1v, (1u)<0]<0(cid:19) ,

and it is straightforward to check that

[u, v] = (1[u, v])<0 = [v,u] .

(3.17)

(3.18)

then, the proof of the theorem can be completed by considering the relation between the
innitesimal transformations u and v and the ow equations given by (3.14).

the ow equations (3.15) can be expressed in terms of lax operators. let u  +k0

and consider

u = u  (1u)0 = 1(u  u) ,

(3.19)

where we have used the notation u = (u) + u and eq. (3.13). then, if u = eb + ,
the lax operators corresponding to b and  can be dened by analogy with (3.14):

u = elb + l .

(3.20)

in other words,

3in the following, we will use the notation like ( )<0 = p<0( ).

8

denition 2 let b  k0  a0 and   k0  a1, the (gauge xed) lax operators
associated with db and d are dened by

lb = db  (1b)0 = 1(db  b) ,
l = d + ( 1)0 = 1(d + ) ,

(3.21)

where db = (db) + db and d = (d) + d. the lax operators lb and l are
even and odd, respectively.

then, theorem 1 translates into the following (super) commutation relations

theorem 2 for each u, v  +k0, b, c  k0  a0, and ,   k0  a1, the following
commutation relations are satised

[lb, lc] = l[c,b] ,

[u, v] = [v,u] ,
[ lb, l] = [l, lb] = l[,b] ,
[ l, l] = [ l, l] = l[,] .

proof: it is straightforward by using (3.19), (3.21), and (3.16). for example,

[u, v] = 1[u  u, v  v] = 1(cid:16)[v,u] + [u, v](cid:17)

= 1(cid:16)[v,u]  [v, u](cid:17) = [v,u] .

(3.22)

(3.23)

3.3 supersymmetric ow equations

one of the main motivations of the work of delduc and gallot in [5] was to ob-
in other words, hierarchies whose ow equations are
tain supersymmetric hierarchies.
compatible with a supersymmetry transformation relating commuting to anticommuting
elds.

since both the construction of [5] and ours are formulated directly in n = 1 superspace
with coordinates x = (x, ), there is a built-in supersymmetry transformation induced
by the covariant derivative: susy
q = dq, where  is any constant grassmann-odd
parameter. by construction, and according to eqs. (3.21), (3.11), (3.22), and (2.10)



which implies the identities

l = el ,

and l =

1
2

[ l, l] = el ,

d = d and d =


x

.

(3.24)

(3.25)

all this allows one to extend the supersymmetry transformation to the space of functionals
of  or, equivalently, to the space of gauge invariant functionals of q by means of susy
=
d. therefore, a ow equation will be supersymmetric if, and only if, it commutes with
d.



taking into account the commutation relations (3.16), it is straightforward to prove

9

theorem 3 the ow equation d is supersymmetric if, and only if,

  0 = ker(ad)0 .

(3.26)

remarkably, although they are generally non-local, the supersymmetric ows can be

written in terms of the same (super) classical r-matrix r used in eq. (2.17).

proposition 2 for each b  0  a0 and   0  a1, the corresponding supersym-
metric ow equations on q can be written as

dbq = [r( 1

l b l), l] ,

dq = [r(1

l  l), l] ,

(3.27)

where r = 1

2(p0  p<0) and l is given by (3.10).

proof: consider u = eb +   +0. since [u, ] = 0, and taking into account (3.24), the

innitesimal transformation of the gauged xed eq can be written as [ u, el] = 0, where

u has been dened in (3.19). moreover, according to (3.12) and (3.13),

u = el1

l (u  u)lel

= el(cid:16)u  (1

l ul)0 + l(cid:17)el ,

(3.28)

(3.29)

(3.30)

(3.31)

where

therefore, according to (3.11), the innitesimal transformation of q is given by

l = el(uel)  +a<0
0

.

this leads to

[el uel, l] = 0 .

uq = [( 1

l u l)0  l, l] ,

which is equivalent to (3.27) up to an innitesimal gauge transformation generated by l
that can be omitted because ow equations are dened on the space of gauge invariant
functionals of q. finally, the proof of the proposition follows by considering (3.9), (3.14),
and taking into account that [u, ] = 0.

in particular, proposition 2 allows one to check that the ow equations (2.17) con-
sidered by delduc and gallot are recovered from our ow equations with the constant
elements in z, the centre of k = ker(ad).

corollary 1 if b  z 0, db coincides with /tb in eq. (2.17).

proof: it is straightforward by considering proposition 2 and (3.10):

1

l b l = e f ebe e f = e f be f = bb ,

(3.32)

where we have used that [b, ] = 0.

taking into account this result and lemma 1, the ows associated with the elements in
z are local ows in the sense that dbq is a super-dierential polynomial of q. in general,
the ows associated with the lax operators (3.21) are non-local. however, it is important
to notice that, a priori , nothing prevents the existence of other local ows than those
associated with z. in particular, there could be grassmann-odd local ows. an example
is provided by the the following lemma.

10

lemma 4 if there exists an element   k0 such that [, k<0]  k<0, the ow equation
associated with d is local.

proof: without loss of generality, let us suppose that  is odd. then, d is induced by
the lax operator

l = d + ( 1)0 = d + (e f eeef )0 .

however, since a<0  a0, in this case

and, hence,

(ee)0 =  + (ee)<0

0

,

l = d + (e f ef )0 +  ,

(3.33)

(3.34)

(3.35)

where   a<0
0 . acting on q, the only eect of  is to generate an innitesimal gauge
transformation. therefore, on the space of gauge invariant functionals the ow d can
be equivalently dened by l  , which proves that d indeed is local.

examples where this lemma applies will be presented in section 5.

4 local and non-local conserved quantities

in this section, we will construct an innite number of local and non-local conserved
quantities with respect to the bosonic ow equations (2.17) associated with z, the centre
of k = ker(ad). we will also investigate which of them are supersymmetric.

since most of the following expressions involve non-local terms, it is necessary to
specify the boundary conditions. we will restrict ourselves to hierarchies where the su-
pereld q = q(x) goes rapidly to zero at x = . then, since f and h in lemma 1 are
super-dierential polynomials of q, they also vanish at x = :

q (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)x=

= f (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)x=

= h (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)x=

= 0 .

(4.1)

consider the ow equation associated with any b  z 0. according to (3.10) and (3.12),

db = (1b)<0 = eef (ef ebeef )<0el

= eef (ef bef )<0el ,

(4.2)

where it has been taken into account that l  a0 and [b, ] = 0. using (4.1), this leads
to

= 0 ,

(4.3)

db(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)x=

= e(b)<0el (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)x=

where we have used that b  z 0  a0. all this allows one to prove the following

proposition 3 all the components of  |x= are conserved quantities with respect to
the (bosonic) ows associated with z 0.

11

proof: first of all, using (4.1) and (3.12),

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)x=

= eep0() (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)x=

.

(4.4)

consider  =pj>0 (j)j, where j  kj and (j) is a supereld taking values in the

grassmann algebra gr. then, decompose the conservation equation (4.3) in its graded
components with respect to d1. the component whose grade equals 1 reads

(1  p0(1)) = 0 ,

(4.5)

db(1) (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)x=

which implies that (1)|x= is conserved. next, let us suppose that (j)|x= is conserved
for all 1  j < n and consider the grade-n component of (4.3),

db(cid:18)(n )(n  p0(n )) +   (cid:19)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)x=

= 0 ,

(4.6)

where the ellipsis indicates products of (j)|x=s with j < n. therefore, one concludes
that (n )|x= is also conserved, which completes the proof.

notice that the components of  are non-local functions of q; in other words, they
involve d1q and, hence, are not super dierential polynomials of q. this is the reason
why their asymptotic values do not vanish in spite of the boundary conditions (4.1).
however, some of the components of |x= provide the local conservation laws given
by (2.20).

proposition 4 for each   [k, k],

j l

 =z +



dx xh, i =z dx h, hi

is a supersymmetric local conserved quantity.

proof: consider (3.3); since   [k, k], it leads to

h, hi = h, e(de) + ee  i = h, di .

then, taking into account x = d2 and (4.1),

j l

 =z +



dx dh, hi =z +



dx




h, hi =z dx h, hi .

(4.7)

(4.8)

(4.9)

being written as the superintegral of a super dierential polynomial of the supereld q,
the local conserved quantity j l
 is manifestly invariant with respect to the supersymmetry
transformation susy

q = dq, where  is any constant grassmann-odd parameter.



a convenient denition of the non-local conserved quantity associated with a generic

element   k0 is

j =z +



dx x str (e) ,

(4.10)

where str is the supertrace (see appendix b.1). taking into account proposition 3, j
is obviously conserved. let us calculate the supersymmetric transformation of j. first

12

of all, recall that (3.25) allows one to extend the supersymmetry transformation susy
the space of functionals of . therefore,



to

susy


j = dj =  z +



dx x str ( d e) ,

where, using (3.3),

de = eh + e  e .

moreover, it is easy to show that

str(cid:16) (e  e)(cid:17) = str ([, ]e) ,

which allows one to write the supersymmetric transformation of j as follows

(4.11)

(4.12)

(4.13)

susy


j =  z +



at this stage, we would like to make a comment about partial integrations in expres-

dx x str ( e h)   z +
it is clearly not true that r dx xp (x) = 0 if p (x) is a

sions with non-local terms.
generic non-local expression; for example, if p (x) = 1
x q the statement is obviously false.
if, in agreement with (4.1), we choose boundary conditions such that all local expressions
vanish suciently fast at x =  and we take p (x) = l(x)n(x), where l(x) is a local
expression while n(x) may be non-local, then the statement is true. this is clear since

dx x str ([, ] e) .

(4.14)



z +



dxxp (x) = (l(x)n(x))(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

+



= 0

(4.15)

due to the vanishing of l(x) at x = . so, as long as we limit ourselves to expressions
of the form localnon-local, the use of partial integration is justied.

taking into account all this, and since h is local, the rst term on the right-hand side

of (4.14) vanishes and, therefore,

susy


j = j[,] ,

which allows one to single out the set of supersymmetric non-local quantities.

proposition 5 for each   0 = ker(ad)0 the non-local conserved quantity

j =z +



dx x str ( e) =z dx str ( e h)

is supersymmetric with respect to susy



q = dq.

(4.16)

(4.17)

the proof follows directly from (4.16), and the expression of j as a superintegral is
obtained by using x = d2 and (4.12) (see also eq. (4.9)).

for a general , the conserved quantity j is a function of  and, therefore, has
two scalar components. however, when [, ] = 0 the right-hand side of (4.17) shows
that the component along  vanishes. in order to split the two scalar components of a

13

generic conserved quantity let us consider x = d2 in eq. (4.10) together with eqs. (4.12)
and (4.13):

dx d str (eh  [, ]e) .

(4.18)

j =z +



then, using the denition of the superderivative d and taking into account that h is
local, j can be written as

where the scalar components are given by

j = i   i[,] ,

i =z dx d str ( e) =z dx str ( e h  [, ]e) ,

(4.19)

(4.20)

which exhibits that j = i whenever [, ] = 0, in agreement with (4.17).

if j and k are the d1-grades of  and , respectively, it is straightforward to prove
that i has dimension j/2k with respect to a scale transformation where the dimension
of x and  is 1 and 1
2. moreover, i is grassmann-odd or grassmann-even depending on
whether  is a odd or even element of the superalgebra, respectively.

finally, it is worth noticing that, according to theorem 3, the non-local supersymmetric
conserved quantities are in one-to-one relation with the supersymmetric ow equations.
however, we have not been able to nd a deeper relationship between them where, for
example, j could be understood as the generator of the ow d.

5 principal hierarchies

in this section we will restrict ourselves to consider supersymmetric kdv systems in which
 is a principal fermionic element of a, i.e.,

 =xi

aiei

where the sum is over all the simple roots of the algebra, and the ai are non-zero numbers.
a necessary condition for the existence of such an element is that a is equipped with a
fermionic simple root system, and in table 2 we give a complete list of all such ane lie
superalgebras; for future reference the table contains also the bosonic subalgebras.

however, we will start by giving two lemmas which apply to the general case, namely:

lemma 5 an element   a0 is semi-simple in a if and only if it is semi-simple in a0.

it is well known that an element in a lie algebra is semi-simple if and only if it can be
taken to be element of a cartan subalgebra. the same argument can be immediately
applied for lie superalgebras, and then the lemma follows, since a cartan subalgebra of
a0 is a cartan subalgebra of a.

lemma 6 if   a is regular in a0, then [k1, k1]  z, where k = ker(ad()) and z is
the centre of k.

 is regular in a0, so we can take a basis in which k0 is the cartan subalgebra h of a.
k1 consists of odd root-generators e with eigenvalue zero under ad(). if e, e  k1,
then    = 0, (including the case  = ), namely:

note that, for low values of m, the even subalgebras may t into the general scheme only

1)  = :    6= 0 implies that 2 is a root (see [16]) which is a contradiction, since

[k1, k1]  h.

2)  6= :    6= 0 implies that either  +  or    is a root (this can be easily
shown using the jacobi identity on the generators e, e and e). this is again
a contradiction, for the same reason as above.

this implies that if h  [k1, k1] and e  k1, then [h, e] = (  )e = 0, and
therefore h  z.

for future reference, we will formulate part of this lemma as a corollary:

corollary 2 for  regular in a0 and in a basis of root-generators for k1: if  and 
are roots such that e, e  k1, then 2 = 2 =    = 0.

dening [k1, k1]  z   z, an immediate consequence of the arguments given in the

proof of the lemma is the following

corollary 3 z  is completely degenerate

since for any two elements h, h  z  we have hh, hi =    = 0.

5.1 principal elements

let now  be a principal element of a, where a is one of the ane lie superalgebras listed
in table 2 except d(2, 1; ); we have chosen not to consider this exceptional superalgebra
in detail in order to keep the exposition as simple as possible, but it can be treated using
the same methods as the other algebras. we write a grading d in the form (s0, s1, . . . , sr),
where si is the grade of the generator corresponding to the simple root i. then, we call
principal hierarchies those associated with a principal element , the principal grading
d1 = (1, 1, . . . , 1), and another gradation d0. it is convenient to distinguish the following
cases:

15

 d0 = (1, 0, 0, . . . , 0) is the homogeneous grading. this corresponds to what we will

call skdv type hierarchies.

 d0 = d1 are both the principal grading. we will call the corresponding hierarchies

smkdv hierarchies, supersymmetric modied kdv hierarchies.

 d0 is in between 4 the homogeneous and the principal gradings. the resulting
hierarchies are the spmkdv hierarchies, supersymmetric partially modied kdv
hierarchies.

the choice of d0 is always restricted by the non-degeneracy condition (2.4). when 
is principal, this condition is satised both for the skdv and smkdv type hierarchies,
except for the algebra a(m, m)(1), where the choice d0 = (1, 0, 0, . . . , 0) does not satisfy
(2.4).
instead we can consider a minimally modied spmkdv hierarchy; we can for
example follow [5] and take d0 = (1, 0, 0,    , 0, 0, 1).

in the principal hierarchies, the d1- (principal) grade of  is by denition 1.

in
addition, k0 = {0}, which follows directly from the corresponding statement for bosonic
hierarchies, since k0 is bosonic. this implies that lemma 2 applies, i.e., it is always
possible, without constraining the lax operator, to nd an even supereld l such that
ll1
l = d + . we can therefore immediately use sections 3 and 4 to dene ow
equations and conserved quantities.

since all bosonic simple roots of a0 can be obtained as sums of two simple roots of
a,  = 1
2 [, ] is a principal element in a0.  is therefore regular in a0, and according
to lemma 5 regular in a. according to table 2, a0 is always of the form g1  g2, or
g1  g2  u(1)(1) in the case of a(2m2, 2m1)(2). the subalgebra g1 is always simple
except in the case of d(2, 1)(1) where g1 = d(1)
1 . even in the case of
a(2m2, 2m1)(2),  is (with one exception) an element in g1  g2. this follows from
the fact that  has grade 2, while the u(1)(1)-part of a(2m2, 2m1)(2) has grade larger
than 2. the only exception is a(0, 1)(2), where the even subalgebra is u(1)(1)  a(1)
1 and
where the u(1)(1) subalgebra has grade 2; we will treat this example in detail in section
6. it is therefore clear that we can write  = 1 + 2 where i is a principal element in
gi.

2  a(1)

1  a(1)

the problem of nding the even subalgebra k0 of k, and of nding explicit realizations
of its elements, has therefore been reduced to the problem of nding the kernel of ad()
in the case where  is a principal element in a (bosonic) lie algebra g. this question
has been studied in e.g. [1]. the elements of ker(ad()) are in one-to-one correspondence
with the set of exponents {ei} of g, and are essentially of the form ei; for more details
and for the exceptions see appendix c.1 and [1].

the task which is left is to nd the odd subspace k1 of k. in order to do this, consider
the covering homomorphism , the mapping which sends the ane algebra a = l(g,  ) 
g  c[, 1] into the corresponding nite algebra g by setting  equal to 1 (or any non-
zero number). take a root-basis for g such that (k0) is the cartan subalgebra. as
shown in corollary 2, any two (fermionic) roots  and  such that e, e  (k1) must
satisfy 2 = 2 =    = 0. the space spanned by those roots  such that e  (k1)
is therefore completely degenerate. denote by (d+, d) the signature of the root-space of

4it is possible to make this precise by dening a partial ordering of gradings, see [2]

16

a 5; the maximum dimension of a completely degenerate subspace is min(d+, d). thus
the maximal dimension of (k1) is 2 min(d+, d) (for each root  we have e).

in appendix c.1 we show that  together with the elements of [, k0], [[, k0], k0],
etc., saturate this limit, except in the case of the algebra a(2m1, 2m1)(2).
in this
last case, the bound allows two extra sets of elements of k1 which we nd by explicit
calculations, see eq. (c.1).

the elements of k1 turn out to fall naturally into two distinct classes of elements (four
in the case of a(2m1, 2m1)(2)). we denote the elements in these two (four) classes
by i and i (plus i and i) respectively, where i is the principal grade. a convenient
way to parametrize the grades is to write 1+2i and 1+2i, where for a(m, m)(1) i  z,
and for all other algebras i  2z + 1. we identify  = 1. the elements i and i of
a(2m1, 2m1)(2) have grades 2m1 and 6m3 respectively, both modulo 8m4.

for all the algebras we can summarize the commutation-relations within k1 in the

surprisingly simple general expressions:

[i, j] =
2
[ i, j] = 2
[i, j] =
0

i+j

2

i+j

(5.1)

the elements on the right-hand side of these equations form the subset z   z.
in
appendix c.2 we nd that in the case of d(m+1, m)(1) there is one series of elements in
z \ z , which we denote by c2m+4pm, p  z, while in all other cases we have z  = z. we
recall that in the algebra a(m, m) we have the equivalence relation 1i  0 where 1i is the
(m+1)(m+1) unit matrix 6, which implies that in a(m, m)(1) and a(2m, 2m)(4) we have
h = 0, where h is the coxeter number. for the elements i and i in a(2m1, 2m1)(2),
we nd

i+j

2

i+j

[i, j] = 2
[i, j] = 2
[i, j] = 0
[i, j] = [i, j] = [i, j] = [i, j] = 0

(5.2)

combining these relations with theorem 1, we immediately have explicit expressions
for the algebra generated by the fermionic ows and the ows related to elements in z.

(5.3)

and similarly for the ows corresponding to eq. (5.2).

not all of these ows are supersymmetric, i.e., not all are compatible with the su-
persymmetry transformation. according to theorem 3, the supersymmetric ows are
those corresponding to elements in  = ker(ad), i.e., the elements in the centre plus

5in the case of a(m, n) we actually use the signature of a space which includes the root-space as a

subspace, see page 28

17

i, i, i  k1, with corresponding ows i, dc2m+4pm in the case of d(m+1, m)(1), di, di
and d i. we have used the fact that for the principal hierarchies, the only even elements
which commute with  are those in the centre, or (k0 \ z)   = , as is evident in
appendix c.1.

we have given here the commutation relations of the subalgebra k1z of k. using the
explicit expressions given in the appendices it is straightforward to nd the commutation
relations for all elements of k, and thereby also the algebra generated by all the possible
ows. the result is that k is a subalgebra of the principal super heisenberg algebra of

a| without central extension, which is isomorphic to the ane superalgebra egl1|1 [10,

11]. this generalizes the well known role of the principal heisenberg algebra in the kp
hierarchy and in the original ds (bosonic) hierarchies. we expect that this relationship
helps to derive a tau-function formalism for these hierarchies in analogy with refs. [12, 13,
14] and, especially, to construct solutions for the equations of the hierarchy using super
vertex operator representations; in particular, multi-soliton solutions.

5.2 special cases

5.2.1 a(m, m)(1)

the hierarchies related to the algebras a(m, m)(1) have been studied previously in e.g.
[5, 15], and it is known that in these cases the supersymmetry can in fact be extended to
an n = 2 supersymmetry. in our formalism, there is a very natural explanation for this
fact: we see from the list above that there is a fermionic element 1  k which satises
2
1 = . it follows from lemma 4 that d1, the corresponding fermionic ow, is a local
ow, and from theorem 1 that ( d1)2 = 2 = x, and it is therefore clear that d1 = d
and i d1 satises the n = 2 supersymmetry algebra.

5.2.2 a(2m1, 2m1)(2)
in this case, as mentioned above, k in eq. (2.19) contains fermionic elements. according
to eq. (2.20), this implies that we have an innite number of local conserved fermionic
quantities. moreover, explicit calculations show that [k0, i] = [k0, i] = 0. this, together
with the commutations relations (5.2), shows that [2m1, k<0]  k<0, and therefore
according to lemma 4 the corresponding ow d2m1 is local.

6 example: skdv

we will demonstrate the application of our construction in the example of skdv, the
supersymmetric version of the usual kdv hierarchy. this hierarchy has previously been
studied by many authors, mainly in the formalism of super pseudo-dierential operators
[6, 17, 8, 9, 18], but also using lie superalgebras [4]. there are several advantages in
taking skdv as example:
it is one of the simplest possible examples; we can compare
the results of our construction with the results obtained using other methods; and we can
demonstrate to which extent our method gives new results even for a hierarchy that has
already been considerably studied.

the skdv hierarchy is the supersymmetric hierarchy dened by taking  to be the

18

principal element in a(0, 1)(2) [4] 7, and to take d1 to be the principal grading d1 = (1, 1),
and d0 to be the homogeneous grading, d0 = (1, 0)

elements x  a(0, 1)(2) can be realized as 3  3 matrices of the form:

x =

2 u

1 +  2 3 +  4

3 +  4  u + j0
+1   2

j

j+

 u  j0



where i, u and ji are polynomials in 2 and 2. we take  and  to be respectively:

in this realization we can write the principal gradation d1 as ad(e2,2  e3,3 + 2 
), where
ei,j denotes the matrix with 1 in the i, jth position, and zero elsewhere, while the homo-
geneous gradation d0 is ad( 

).

a(0, 1)(2) is one of the two only examples where  is not the direct sum of two terms
which are each a principal element in a simple part of the even subalgebra (the other
is d(2, 1)(1)).
1 , and
a part which lies in the u(1)(1) subalgebra. this gives only trivial modications to the
procedure, however.

instead  is here a direct sum of a part which is principal in a(1)

and z  k0 is generated by the elements b2+4i = 2i. they satisfy

[1+4i, 1+4j] = 2b2+4(i+j),
[d2+4i, 1+4j] =  3+4(i+j),

[ 3+4i, 3+4j] = 2b2+4(i+j+1)
[d2+4i, 3+4j] = 1+4(i+j+1),

and it is worth noticing that the conventions we are using in this particular case are
dierent from the general ones in the previous section (for example see eq. (5.1) and
notice that b2+4i 6= 1+2i).

we choose the drinfeld-sokolov gauge to be of the form

7in [4], the authors consider the algebra c(2)(2) = osp(2, 2)(2). for simplicity we have chosen to
consider instead a(0, 1)(2), since c(2)  a(0, 1) and a(0, 1) is realized in terms of 3  3 matrices, while
we need 4  4 matrices to realize c(2).

(x) is a supereld which we can expand on elds as (x) = (x) + u(x), where u(x) is
the usual kdv function and (x) is its superpartner.

using the denition (3.27) for the bosonic ows corresponding to the elements of z,

we nd the ow corresponding to b6 to be:

6(x) = d6 + 3d2(d)

which is the skdv equation, and we nd h, dened in eq. (2.16), to be

h =

1
2

d2 

1
8

dd6 +   

where the ellipsis symbolises terms with lower grades, so the local conserved currents
related to the rst two bosonic ows are  and d, respectively.

in order to calculate the rst non-trivial supersymmetric fermionic ow, d3, we need

to nd the non-local quantity , dened in eq. (3.3). for the rst few grades, we nd:

 = 

d2 1 +

d2(d2)b2 +

d1(cid:16)12d1(d)  3d1(d2) + d1d2(cid:17) 5 +   

(6.2)

where again the ellipsis denotes terms of lower grade. using this and eq. (3.27), we nd
the rst non-trivial fermionic ow to be:

d3 = d3 + 2d2d2  dd1

this is exactly the non-local ow found in [8], where the fermionic ows were dened
using pseudo-dierential operators as ows related to the fourth root of the lax operator.
we can verify by direct calculation that this ow satises d2

3 = 6.

in section 4 we have shown that if we impose suitable boundary conditions on the
elds, in this case assuming that (x) goes suciently fast to zero for x    ,
then the components of |x= are conserved quantities under all bosonic ows.
it
is instructive to check explicitly that this is true with respect to 6, since in order to
show conservation we already need to use partial integration with non-local quantities,
as described on page 13. we have done this calculation down to grade 5. in this case
the conservation depends on a considerable number of cancellations of terms, giving a
non-trivial check of the conservation of |x=. here we will restrict ourselves to show
the conservation of the components of grade 1, 2 and 3 only.

according to (4.10), the conserved quantity associated with  = 1 is

j =z +



dx x str (e) =z +



dx x str () = 2z +



dx 

(6.3)

which, using (4.19), gives rise to two scalar conserved quantities

i = 2z dx d1,

i[,] = 2i = 2z dx 

(6.4)

using proposition 5, i is a supersymmetric grassmann-even conserved quantity while i
is a non-supersymmetric fermionic conserved quantity. this agrees with the results of [8],

20

where i  j1/2 and i  h1, which is the hamiltonian corresponding to the even ow

ally, this non-local quantity was not mentioned in [8] and has not previously been shown to

ow equations of the hierarchy. in particular,

7 conclusions

for the entire class of supersymmetric drinfeld-sokolov integrable hierarchies constructed
by delduc and gallot in [5], we have dened an innite sequence of additional grassmann-
odd and grassmann-even ow equations, which are given by non-local equations, i.e.,
which are not dened by super-dierential polynomials of the dynamical variables. in this

21

sense, they have to be seen as generalizations of the fermionic ows constructed by dargis
and mathieu for the supersymmetric kdv equation in [8]. all these ows commute with
the bosonic ones originally considered in [5] and, hence, provide new fermionic and bosonic
symmetry transformations for the hierarchy.
in particular, one of the fermionic ows
corresponds precisely to the built-in supersymmetry transformation and, in some cases,
others provide additional supersymmetries. the new ow equations do not commute
among themselves; instead, they close an innite non-abelian superalgebra.

the supersymmetric hierarchies of [5] are associated with a (twisted) loop superalgebra
a, and two compatible gradations d1 and d0. they are dened by means of fermionic lax
operators of the form l = d +q(x, )+ where q(x, ) is a n = 1 supereld taking values
in a subspace of a, d is the superderivative, and  is a constant d1-graded element of
a whose square  = [, ]/2 is semi-simple. then, following our construction, there is a
non-local ow associated with each element in k = ker(ad) with non-negative d1-grade,
i.e., in k0, and these ows close an innite superalgebra isomorphic to k0. in contrast,
the mutually commuting ows originally considered by the authors of [5] are associated
with the elements in the centre of k0, which contains only even elements. since the
built-in supersymmetry transformation susy
= d is identied with the ow equation
associated with , it is easy to characterise the ows which are supersymmetric: those
associated with the elements in k0 that commute with . of course, all the commuting
bosonic ows of [5] are supersymmetric.



we have also constructed an innite series of non-local quantities which are conserved
by all the commuting bosonic ows associated with the centre of k0. to be precise, there
is a non-local conserved quantity for each element in k0, and only those conserved quan-
tities associated with the elements that commute with  are supersymmetric. therefore,
there is a one-to-one relationship between non-local ow equations and non-local conserved
quantities, which suggest that the latter could be understood as the generators of the for-
mer. in the case of the supersymmetric kdv equation, this relationship was established in
the work of dargis and mathieu [8] and ramos [9] by using the super pseudo-dierential
lax operator formalism. in our case, the precise nature of this relationship is one of the
open questions that is left to be the subject of future work.

as an example of our construction, we have worked out in detail the structure of the
non-local ow equations and conserved currents for the, so called, principal hierarchies,
which are associated with the ane superalgebras that have a fermionic simple root sys-
tem; namely, those listed in table 2. then, d1 is the principal gradation and  is the cyclic
element, i.e., the sum of the (ane) simple root generators. actually, these hierarchies
can be seen as the direct generalization of the original drinfeld-sokolov construction, and
their commuting bosonic ows were dened rst by inami and kanno [4, 15]. in order to
proceed, we have constructed explicit matrix-representations for the ane lie superalge-
bras with fermionic simple root systems which, as far as we know, are not available in the
literature. using them, we have shown that k = ker(ad) is a subalgebra of the innite
superoscillator algebra constructed by kac and van de leur in [10], i.e., of the principal
heisenberg superalgebra of a| without central extension [11]. the precise form of the
subalgebra depends on the particular superalgebra we have started with. this generalises
the well known role of the oscillator and heisenberg algebras in the kp hierarchy [19]
and the generalized hierarchies of kdv type [2, 12, 14]. it also suggests the possibility of
understanding our hierarchies of local and non-local ows as reductions of the super kp
hierarchy of super hirota bilinear equations constructed in the second article of [10].

finally, let us comment about the construction of solutions for the equations of these
hierarchies. according to (3.21), a particular solution is specied by , which satises
the system of rst order super dierential equations given by (3.15). in order to solve it,
consider the decomposition +a = +a<0  +a0, where +a<0 (+a0) is the subalgebra
formed by the elements with negative (non-negative) d1-grade. next, let g and g+ be
the subgroups obtained by (formally) exponentiating the subalgebras +a<0 and +a0,
respectively, and dene g = g g+, which is the super analogue of the big cell of a loop
group [13]; if g belongs to g, we shall write g = gg+ for its unique factorization with
g  g. then, the general solution of (3.15) is

where g is any constant element in g and 0  g+ is the solution of the associated
linear problem corresponding to  = 1i:

 = (0g) ,

(7.1)

0 = (du  u)0 = 0 ;

(7.2)

lu(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)=1i

in the parlance of the second and third articles in [12], 0 is the vacuum solution of the
associated linear problem. eq. (7.1) provides an innite set of solutions parametrized by
the elements of g. by analogy with the bosonic hierarchies, the elements obtained by
exponentiating super vertex operators should be related to the multi-soliton solutions [12].
eq. (7.2) can be easily solved for the principal hierarchies. to be specic, let us restrict
ourselves to the ows associated with the elements of the form 1+2i, 1+2i, and bi = 
2 ,
which is a subset of k1  z  k0; the resulting expressions can be easily modied to
cover the complete set of ows. in order to solve (7.2), it is convenient to introduce and
innite number of even times ti associated with bi, and two innite sets of odd times i
and i associated with i and i, respectively. then, since d1 = d, the ows can be
realized on the set of functions of these variables according to

b lie superalgebras

in this appendix we will recall a few basic facts about lie superalgebras which are of
special relevance to this paper. for a complete introduction to the subject we refer to e.g.
[16, 20]

25

b.1 bilinear form

a lie superalgebra is a z2-graded algebra g = g0  g1, equipped with a graded com-
mutator, which satises the graded jacobi identity. we are here interested only in the
contragredient or basic classical lie superalgebras, which are those that are equipped with
a non-degenerate bilinear form h, i which is invariant, i.e.:

hx, [y, z]i = h[x, y ], zi

consider such a lie superalgebra g. given a matrix-representation r of g, the bilinear
form in this representation is dened by

where str is the supertrace. a standard matrix representation can be written in the form:

hx, y ir = str (r(x)r(y ))

x =  a 
 b !

where a, b,  and  are matrices, and the even subspace is formed of matrices of the form

0 b !; in this representation the supertrace is dened by
  a 0

str (x) = tr (a)  tr (b)

all bilinear forms are equal up to normalization. the killing form is the bilinear form

in the adjoint representation; it may be identically zero.

note that while the bilinear form is dened only on the superalgebra, it is always
possible to work in some matrix representation, and in that case the supertrace is dened
on the universal enveloping algebra.

if h is an element of the cartan subalgebra h  g and e is a root generator, then

we have

[h, e] = (h)e

where () is a linear functional on h. we denote by h the element in h such that
(h) = hh, hi. we have

[e, e] = he, eih,

where he, ei 6= 0.

the bilinear form gives rise to an inner product (which is in general not positive

denite) by

it follows directly that

   = hh, hi

[h, e] = (h) e = (  ) e

b.2 root systems of ane lie superalgebras.

in this section, we will recall some useful facts about the root systems of lie superalgebras.
we will give the standard realizations of the root systems of some nite lie superalgebras,
which is useful for the calculation of the signature of the root-spaces, see page 17, and we

26

will give the fermionic simple root systems, as well as explicit matrix realizations of the
principal elements .

most of the construction in section 5 can be done without knowing the precise form
of the principal element . in general, it is sucient to know that we can nd a matrix
representation where  takes the form

 0 !
 =  0 

(b.1)

where  and  are unspecied matrices, and that

2 =  1

0 2 !

0

where 1 and 2 are principal elements in the lie algebras g1 and g2, together with the
knowledge that we have of the structure of the bosonic case. there are, however, a few
cases where it turns out to be necessary to actually nd an expression for  in order to
do explicit calculations. explicit calculations are necessary to show that the spurious
element of k0 in the case of d(m+ 1, m)(1) is an element of z, see page 34, and to nd the
extra elements of k1 and their commutation relations in the case of a(2m  1, 2m  1)(2),
see page 33.

at the same time, we are not aware of any reference in which one can nd explicit
expressions for the matrix-representations of fermionic simple root systems of ane lie
superalgebras. since lie superalgebras with fermionic simple root systems are important
in several applications of lie superalgebras, for example in supersymmetric toda theory
or supersymmetric hamiltonian reduction, we have chosen to give these expressions in
some detail.

note that there are other matrix realizations of lie superalgebras which may be useful

when studying supersymmetric integrable hierarchies, see [21].

in all cases 1, . . . , n denotes an orthonormal basis of a vector space v+, while 1, . . . , m
denotes a basis of a vector space v with negative denite inner product, normalized so
i  j = ij (where ij is the usual kronecker delta-symbol). in addition, ei,j will denote
a matrix (the dimensions will be clear from the context) with one in the i, jth position,
and zero elsewhere.

for b(n, m) and d(n, m) the root space is v+  v. in the case of a(n1, m1), the

we will now give the fermionic simple root systems and the explicit matrices corre-
sponding to the principal elements considered in this paper. let us remind the reader
that the simple root system for an untwisted ane lie superalgebra can be chosen to
consist of the simple root system of the corresponding nite lie superalgebra, with the
addition of an ane root, which can be realized as e, where  is the loop-parameter,
and e is the generator corresponding to minus the highest root.
in the case of an
ane lie superalgebra twisted with an automorphism of order k, the automorphism gives
i=0 gi where g0 is invariant under  ,
and each gi forms a representation of g0. as a simple root system of the twisted ane
lie superalgebra we can take a simple root system of g0 in addition to the ane root
which we can realize as e, where e is in this case the (unique) lowest weight in the
g0-representation provided by g1.

where xi  ker(ad(i)), or, in the case of a(2m2, 2m1)(2), of elements x + u, where u
is an element of the u(1)(1) subalgebra of a(2m2, 2m1)(2).

ker(ad(i)) are well known, and are generated by the elements ej

i , where {ej} is the

set of exponents of gi, with the following exceptions:

1) d(1)

m has exponents n = 1, 3, 5, . . . , 2m  3 and m  1 mod 2m  2. there is an
element c2m2 of k0 corresponding to the spurious exponent m  1, which is not
associated to m1.

2) a(2)

2m1 has exponents n = 1, 3, 5, . . . , 4m3 mod 4m2. the element of k0 corre-

sponding to the exponent 2m1 is 2m1  1

2m tr (2m1)1i.

we have collected the exponents of the relevant bosonic ane lie algebras in table 3, and
we refer to [1, 22] for further details.

taking commutators [, k0], [[, k0], k0], etc. 8 we can now construct more elements
of k1. the elements found in this way were summarized on page 17.
in table 4 we
compare the number of these generators, modulo twice the coxeter number, with the
maximal possible number 2 min(d+, d) found in the previous subsection. we see that the
number of fermionic generators saturate the limit in all cases except a(2m1, 2m1)(2).
in this last case we nd by explicit calculations two extra series of fermionic generators

8in the particular case of a(1, 1)(1), one has to add the odd generator  =(cid:18) 0

  0 (cid:19) of principal



grade 1, together with [ , k0], [[ , k0], k0], etc.

gives the upper limit 2 min(d+, d) on the number of elements of (k1). as we see, the
second and third columns agree in all cases except a(2m1, 2m1)(2).

c.2 commutation relations

k0 is an abelian algebra, so we need to nd only the commutation relations [k1, k1] and
[k0, k1].

remarkably, we nd that we can always choose the elements 1+2i and 1+2i to be

33

of the following simple form:

1+2i =  
1+2i =  

0

( )i1

( )i1

( )i

 ( )i

(c.4)

. one can easily verify that
note that ( )i = i
the commutation relations of these generators are the ones given in equation (5.1). in the
case of the algebra a(2m1, 2m1)(2), where we have extra fermionic generators i and
i, explicit calculations give the commutation relations eq. (5.2).

1 and ( )i = i

1 = i
2

2 = i

in general k2i is generated by c2i = i

2 where i and j are
exponents of respectively g1 and g2, and z 2i by b2i = c2i + d2i. the exceptions, which
follows directly from the exceptions in the bosonic case described in the previous section,
are:

1 + 0 9 and d2j = 0 + j

1) for the algebra d(m+1, m)(1) there is an extra element c2m + 0  k0 which is not
related to powers of i. in the matrix realization given in section b.2.6, c2m has the
same form as 2m1 in equation (c.2).

2) for the algebra a(2m1, 2m)(2), k4m2 is generated by

using these expressions, it is straightforward to nd which elements of k0 are in the
centre. the only exception is the extra element in k0 in the case of d(m+1, m)(1). here,
a simple calculation shows that c2m = c2m = 0, which shows that c2m + 0  z.

it is easy to verify by direct calculation that

[c2i, 1+2j] = 1+2(i+j1)
[c2i, 1+2j] = 1+2(i+j+1)

(c.5)

while the commutation relations of d2i follow directly by observing that c2i + d2i  z.
using an explicit realization of i and i we nd also

[c2i, j] = [c2i, j] = 0

(c.6)

9in order to simplify the notation, and when the meaning is otherwise clear, we will sometimes write

elements(cid:18) a 0

b (cid:19) in the form a + b.

0

34

moreover, a direct calculation shows that in the algebras a(2m1, 2m)(2) and a(2m1, 2m1)(2)
it is possible to choose the normalizations c4m2 = a4m2 c
such that these elements also satisfy the commutation relations given above.
