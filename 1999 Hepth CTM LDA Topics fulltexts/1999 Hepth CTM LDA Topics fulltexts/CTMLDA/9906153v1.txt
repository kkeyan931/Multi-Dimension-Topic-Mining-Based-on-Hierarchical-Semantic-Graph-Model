abstract

we study some dynamical aspects of the correspondence between strings in ads
space and external heavy quarks in n = 4 sym. specically, by examining waves
propagating on such strings, we make some plausible (and some surprising) infer-
ences about the time-dependent elds produced by oscillating quarks in the strongly-
coupled gauge theory. we point out a puzzle regarding energy conservation in the
sym theory. in addition, we perform a similar analysis of the gauge elds produced
by a baryon (represented as a d5-brane with string-like extension in ads space)
and compare and contrast with the gauge elds produced by a quark-antiquark pair
(represented as a string looping through ads space).

1 introduction

in the context of maldacenas correspondence between gauge theories and gravity [1],
external charges in the gauge theory are dual to macroscopic strings in anti-de sitter
(ads) space whose endpoints lie on the boundary. this identication stems from
the general role of strings connecting parallel branes as w-bosons of the correspond-
ing spontaneously broken worldvolume theory [2], and can be conrmed within the
ads/cft setting by computing the energy of such strings [3, 4].

for concreteness, we will restrict attention to the duality between d = 3 + 1
n = 4 su(n) super-yang-mills (sym) and type iib string theory on ads5  s5.
a solitary static quark (transforming in the fundamental of su(n)) corresponds to
a type iib string which extends solely in the radial direction; a string of opposite
orientation represents an antiquark (transforming in the anti-fundamental of su(n)).
the gkpw recipe for extracting gauge theory expectation values from the bulk action
[5, 6] makes it possible to verify directly that a radial string gives rise to the correct
point charge eld conguration [7]. we note in passing that expectation values due
to string probes in the bulk of ads (with no endpoints on the boundary) have also
been computed [8, 9, 7].

a quark-antiquark pair in the gauge theory is naturally identied with a string
with both of its endpoints on the boundary. expectation values of wilson loops can
thus be deduced from the bulk theory by evaluating the area of a string worldsheet
which is bounded by the loop [3, 4]. the result of such a calculation encodes in
particular the quark-antiquark potential (see [10] for a review of results on wilson
loops obtained from the bulk-boundary correspondence).

a dening property of a string is its ability to undulate. the identication of
strings and charges raises an obvious question: what is the gauge theory interpretation
of string oscillations? this is the issue we will address in what follows. the main
tool at our disposal is again the gkpw calculational prescription [5, 6]. a string
is a source for the supergravity elds, so an oscillating string generates uctuating
elds in the bulk of ads space. the correspondence then translates the uctuating
supergravity elds on the boundary into the time-dependent sym expectation values
associated with an oscillating charge. the analysis thus establishes a correspondence
between string oscillations and gauge theory waves (including, one would hope, the
usual r1 radiation elds produced by an accelerated charge).

in section 2 we will ll in the details of the procedure outlined in the previous
paragraph. to understand the basic ideas it will suce to concentrate on waves of
the dilaton eld, which is known to couple to the operator

in the boundary theory [11, 12]. there is much to be learned by studying waves of
other supergravity elds, especially the graviton, but we will leave this more dicult
exercise for another paper. in the above equation x i, i = 1, . . . , 6, denote the scalar
elds of the n = 4 sym theory (living in the vector of so(6)).

1

the simple case of an oscillating straight radial string will be worked out in section
3. in section 4 we will then extend the analysis to the more intricate case of a bent
string, and discuss some interesting features of the elds of a quark-antiquark pair.
we amplify the discussion on the implications of our results for the sym theory in
section 5, where we point out a puzzle regarding energy conservation in the gauge
theory. in section 6 we apply the same methods to obtain the gauge eld prole due
to a baryon (represented as a d5-brane appropriately wrapped in ads space) and
compare with the quark-antiquark case. a nal section consists of a brief summary
of our conclusions. some aspects of string oscillations and sym waves have been
examined before in [13, 3, 14, 15] and we have attempted to go beyond these eorts
in ways about which we will comment as appropriate.

2 string oscillations make sym waves

we describe the dynamics of a fundamental string through the nambu-goto action

sf =

2 z d2g,

(2)

where g is the induced metric on the string worldsheet. we work in poincare coordi-
nates for ads5, with the metric

making the static gauge choice 1 = t, 2 = z, and restricting attention to congu-
rations with the string pointing along a particular s5 direction,3 the action reduces
to

(4)

where ~x(z, t) denotes the position of the string in the ~x directions. the static solu-
tions to (4) can be taken to lie in the z  x1 plane without loss of generality. they
satisfy

zxs = 

z2
m  z4

qz4

.

(5)

this equation describes a string lying along a geodesic which starts and ends at z = 0
and reaches a maximum at z = zm (see fig. 1). the two endpoints of the string are
separated by a coordinate distance [3, 4]

l = zm

(2)3/2
(1/4)2 .

(6)

3the operator of 2 couples to the spherically symmetric mode of the ten-dimensional dilaton, so
we will focus attention on this mode alone. a string which is localized on the ve-sphere will excite
also all of the higher kaluza-klein harmonics, which are massive elds on ads5. these excitations
would give expectation values to dual higher-dimension operators which have been identied in
[5, 6, 12].

now consider small oscillations about the solution described by (5), letting ~x(z, t) =
~x s(z) + ~y (z, t). for simplicity, we take ~y  ~x s. the linearized equation of motion
for ~y is

in the calculation to follow, we will cut o ads5 by moving the boundary in to
z = z0 and take z0  0 at the end of the calculation. in order to solve (7), we need
boundary conditions for the left and right string endpoints which we will impose in
the form ~y l,r(z0, t) = ~yl,r(t). the interpretation is straightforward:
for a given
z0, the string is attempting to describe a higgsed gauge boson of very large mass
( z1
0 ) transforming in the fundamental of the unbroken su(n) gauge group; this
massive object is an extrinsic degree of freedom from the point of view of the su(n)
gauge theory and has its own dynamics; this dynamics is essentially that of a point
particle and is thus described by a trajectory function ~y(t). for the moment, we will
simply prescribe a trajectory, but the nambu-goto action for the string in the ads5
geometry implies an action for ~y(t) which in turn implies an equation of motion for
the trajectory. we will not pursue this line of thought much further in this paper,
but it is interesting to note that the kinetic term in this equation of motion implies
a quark mass that matches the static total energy of the quark/string.

since the nambu-goto action (2) depends on the background supergravity elds,
it is a source for them as well. in particular, it is a source for the dilaton, a fact which is
best displayed by writing the action in terms of the einstein metric ge
m n = e/2gm n :

sf =

(10)

this equation is solved by by greens function methods as (x) = r d5x d(x, x)j(x),

where d(x, x) is the retarded dilaton propagator [7]. the propagator is in fact only
a function of the invariant distance v, dened by

tion of the much simpler, completely algebraic ten-dimensional ads5 s5 propagator

(14)

the expectation value would of course vanish in the gauge theory vacuum sector. on
the other hand, the string corresponds to the sector of the gauge theory where a heavy
quark has been inserted in the vacuum. we do expect a non-zero expectation value
of the tr f 2 operator in that sector and eq. (14) gives a method for computing it.
carrying out similar steps with higher s5 harmonic modes of the dilaton would yield
gauge theory expectation values for operators of the type tr(f 2xi . . . xj ), where the
xi are the scalar elds of the n = 4 gauge theory [5, 6, 12]. these higher-dimension
operators should give rise to a correspondingly higher power law fallo with |~x|, a
result which should emerge naturally from the structure of the greens functions for
the higher s5 harmonic modes of the dilaton.

under    +  the action varies only by a surface term, because the congu-

ration about which we vary is a solution to the equation of motion:

sbulk =

(15)

as a shorthand, it will be convenient to dene a rescaled dilaton eld  = 5r8/22.
it follows from the foregoing discussion that

our task, then, is to calculate the dilaton eld produced by various string sources
and to pick out the o(z4) term in its expansion near the boundary of ads5.

this equation is most easily solved via fourier transformation. the solution describ-

for simplicity, we specialize to harmonic boundary data,4 ~y(t) = ~a exp(it).

now expand the square root in powers of y . the leading (y -independent) term gives
rise to a static component of the dilaton eld, s(~x, z). its contribution to the gauge
theory expectation value has been computed in [7] and found to be

is the eective strength of the coupling as inferred from the quark-antiquark potential

since, according to (17), we eventually only need the o(z4) terms in , we have set
z0  0 in (24).
if one expands the integrand of i(1) in powers of  = zz cos v/(z2 + z2 + |~x|2),
the rst non-vanishing term is found to be o(3), and higher-order terms will not
contribute to (17). keeping only the relevant terms one obtains

the bulk dilaton eld is evidently a superposition of waves radiated from each point

along the string. the phase delay z + qz2 + |~x|2 is simply the time needed for a

null signal to propagate up along the string to the point z = z, and then travel down
diagonally to reach the boundary at ~x (see fig. 2).

to understand this result from the viewpoint of the boundary theory, it is advan-

tageous to change the variable of integration to  = q1 + z2/|~x|2 + z/|~x|. using (25)

in (17) one nds, after some integration by parts,

the expectation value has been expressed solely in terms of gauge theory quantities
through use of the relation r2/ = q2g2
y m n, as must be possible for a proper gauge
theory interpretation. it should be noted that the dependence of the integrand on
|~x| can be shifted from the phase factor to the envelope function  through an
integration by parts.

figure 2: any given point on the boundary receives radiation from each point along the
string. as a result, the gauge theory wave is a superposition of components with all possible
time delays. see text for discussion.

eq. (26) displays the gauge theory disturbance as a superposition of components
propagating at speeds v = 1/, for all 1    . notice that the weight factor   0
as   , so low velocity components are evidently suppressed. it should be noted
from (19) that the string oscillations actually become large (and our approximations
fail) for large az, so the detailed shape of  cannot be trusted at arbitrarily large
. nonetheless, it is clear from the geometric setup (summarized in fig. 2) that the
gauge theory wave should indeed include components propagating at arbitrarily low
velocities.

the above result implies in particular that even if the charge is shaken abruptly to
generate a sharply dened pulse on the string, the sym observer at ~x will receive an
innitely broadened pulse, only the leading edge of which travels at the speed of light.
the delayed signals presumably arise from rescattering of the original disturbance
from the static background (23) by virtue of the nonlinear dynamics of the strongly-
coupled gauge theory. this rather complex sequence of events would be dicult to
unravel in the gauge theory, but the bulk-boundary correspondence gives a precise
and physically plausible account of it. note that the long time delays originate from
string disturbances at large values of the bulk ads coordinate z, as would be expected
from the uv/ir connection proposed in [16, 17].

it is tempting to speak of (26) as electromagnetic radiation, but the rapid fallo
with |~x| indicates that this would not be strictly correct. we are looking at a contri-
bution to of 2 linear in the displacement of the quark and this can only arise from a
cross-term between the static eld and the uctuating eld. since the static electric
eld is radial and the asymptotic radiation gauge elds (the ones that fall o as |~x|1)
are transverse, their scalar product vanishes. hence there is no unambiguous con-
tribution of electromagnetic radiation to the of 2 expectation value: instead, we see
evidence of uctuations in the near-elds of the moving quarks, elds which do not
transport energy to innity. the unambiguous diagnostic for radiation would be the
demonstration of a net energy ux to spatial innity in the gauge theory. this could
be done by determining the expectation value of the gauge theory energy-momentum

7

tensor, which in the gkpw recipe is dual to the bulk gravitational eld produced
by the uctuating string. it would be extremely interesting to carry out this calcu-
lation explicitly, for it is not at all obvious how (or even if) the ads description of
waves in the boundary theory incorporates energy conservation. in this connection,
we should also remark that our analysis neglects the back-reaction on the string due
to the supergravity elds. we will return to these issues in section 5.

before closing this section, we note that our external charges are by construction
innitely massive, and consequently immune to the sym eld conguration they help
to produce. it is possible to consider instead sources with nite mass, represented
by strings which terminate not at the boundary, but on a solitary d3-brane placed
at zb > 0. in that case one is really studying an su(n + 1) gauge theory, broken
spontaneously to su(n)u(1) by a higgs vacuum expectation value r2/zb [1, 18].

4 gauge fields of heavy quark mesons

we now extend the analysis to the general case zm < , where the string bends
along the geodesic (5). both of its endpoints reach the boundary, so this conguration
describes a quark-antiquark pair (see fig. 1). notice that now the parametrization
~x(z, t) has the disadvantage of being double-valued: for each value of z there are in
fact two points on the string, one on the left and one on the right. when necessary,
we will account for this by means of a discrete subindex: ~x l,r(z, t). the need for this
awkward notation is compensated by the simple form of the dierential equation (7).

notice the peculiar dependence on l and |~x| and the fact that the result is isotropic.
this is not what one would expect from a static electric dipole eld in a linear
gauge theory, but there is nothing obviously inconsistent about it for strongly coupled
n = 4 sym. the above result must be regarded as a prediction of the bulk-boundary
correspondence for which we have at present no independent test.
we now examine the contribution from the uctuating part. equation (7) can be

solved by fourier transformation. the general solution is

~y l,r(z, t) = z d 1 + 2z2n ~a()ei(tzl,r) + ~b()ei(t+zl,r)o ,
zl(z, ) = q(zm)4  1z z

notice that component waves with zm < 1 are exponentially damped, reecting
a frequency cuto imposed by the nite size of the string. the oscillations on the
left and right halves of the string are related by the requirement that the solution
be smooth at the midpoint, z = zm. the coecients ~a and ~b are determined by
enforcing boundary conditions at the string endpoints, ~y l,r(z0, t) = ~yl,r(t):

~a() =

, () = ei2zl(zm,) . (34)

for any given choice of boundary conditions, the string endpoints trace out de-
nite wilson lines ~yl,r(t) in the gauge theory. the solution (33) can be used in (16)
and then (17) to determine the corresponding sym expectation value. rather than
working out the details of such a calculation, which would not be particularly en-
lightening, we will point out some interesting general features of the resulting eld
congurations.

first, it is evident that the sym waves display a phase delay analogous to the
one found for the straight string, although the details are dierent. to understand
this in some detail, imagine that at t = 0 a pulse is sent along the string by shaking
its left end, which we now take to be located at ~x = 0. the induced metric on the
bent string is

gabdadb =

r2

z2 "dt2 +

so the pulse, following a null trajectory, takes a time

or (cid:18)z zm

to reach the point z on the left or right half of the string. in particular, it requires
a time [15]

t = zm

(1/4)2
22

(37)

to traverse the entire string and arrive at the right endpoint, where for the time being
we assume that it is completely absorbed.

as seen in fig. 3, a dilaton wave travels from z down to a boundary point ~x

in an additional time t2(z, ~x) = rz2 +(cid:16)~x  ~x s(z)(cid:17)2

. as a result, the radiation
arriving at ~x has a component with phase lag t1(z) + t2(z, ~x) for each point z on
the string. the net eect is that the sym observer detects a signicantly broadened
pulse, whose leading and trailing edges arrive at times tf = |~x| and tb = t +|~x lx1|,
respectively.
the situation is thus similar to the one encoded in (26), in that an oscillating
source would ultimately give rise to a superposition of gauge theory waves traveling
at dierent speeds v  1. a complicating feature of this situation as compared to the
case of an isolated quark is that, because the string now extends only a nite distance
into ads space, a disturbance on the string can only propagate for a nite time before
running into the boundary. as has been observed by others [15], the time (37) for a
disturbance to propagate from one end of the string to the other corresponds, from the
gauge theory point of view, to a subluminal mean speed of propagation of inuence
v = l/t  0.457. note, however, that this is not the generic speed of propagation of
disturbances in the gauge theory: the whole point of our analysis was to show that
disturbances in the expectation value of of 2 propagate away from their source in the
quark-antiquark system in a conventionally causal fashion: the leading signal arrives
on a direct path at the speed of light, followed by indirect signals that arrive later.

figure 3: any given point on the boundary receives radiation from each point along the
bent string, with a corresponding time delay. notice that the boundary projection of
wavefronts given o at a point z on the string yields a spherical wave which appears to
originate from ~x s(z). see text for discussion.

as an aside, we remark that disturbances propagating on the strings have bizarre
features from the point of view of the boundary gauge theory. for instance, triple-
string congurations (describing for example a quark-monopole-dyon system [19])
can be arranged where a signal originating from one charge would give rise to a
disturbance which would run along the strings and arrive rst at the more distant
(from the boundary theory perspective) of the two other charges [20]. this would
not violate causality, strictly understood, but is certainly strange. to repeat, the key
point is that an oscillation on the string does not translate directly into a wave in
the boundary theory. the correct prescription brings the bulk supergravity elds into
play, and unequivocally predicts causal sym propagation, with propagation velocities
up to the speed of light.

5 implications for gauge theory dynamics

in this paper, we have been exploring a picture, derived from maldacenas ads/cft
duality conjecture, of the generation and propagation of disturbances in the d = 3+1
n = 4 su(n) super-yang-mills (sym) gauge theory. in this picture, external sources
are described by type iib strings running from the boundary into the bulk of ads
space; uctuations in the position of the external sources generate waves on the
strings; the string waves generate propagating disturbances in the supergravity elds
in ads space; nally, the uctuating boundary values of these elds are converted, via
the gkpw recipe, into uctuating expectation values of operators in the gauge the-
ory. throughout the discussion, we have assumed that the string disturbances prop-
agate according to simple nambu-goto dynamics and have treated them as known
linear sources for the supergravity elds. in particular, we have not worried about
back-reaction of the supergravity elds on disturbances propagating on the string.
on the face of it, this seems reasonable because maldacenas conjecture includes
taking the limit of weak supergravity coupling. on the other hand, as we will now

11

discuss, this collection of assumptions leads to some surprising, perhaps paradoxical,
conclusions about the behavior of the gauge theory that are worth pointing out.

a somewhat perplexing feature of the time-dependent eld that can be gleaned
from fig. 3 is that dilaton wavefronts emitted from a point z on the string describing
a quark-antiquark system, give rise to spherical waves in the gauge theory which seem
to emanate from neither the quark nor the antiquark, but from the point ~x s(z) on
the line between them. imagine an observer situated halfway between the quark and
antiquark: if the quark is shaken to produce a pulse on the string, the observer rst
sees disturbances coming rst from the direction of the quark and then (after a time
t /2) from the opposite direction! though odd, this feature is in principle consistent
with the non-linear character of strongly-coupled sym: the external sources give rise
to propagating disturbances, which propagate through and cause to reradiate, the
background gauge eld conguration originally set up by the source. this sort of thing
would happen in any strongly-coupled theory; what is surprising is the geometrical
structure that is inherited from the ads string.

a more profound set of issues arises from the fact that a disturbance travels from
one end of the quark-antiquark string to the other in a nite time (37), forcing us to
consider how the string disturbance reects from the boundary if we wish to account
for radiation generated at later times. since the external sources can be taken to
be as massive as we like (by letting z0  0), it seems reasonable to assume that
the uctuating string should be subject to xed or dirichlet boundary conditions5
which reect any incident disturbance back onto the string (with a change of sign).
this would mean that a disturbance, however it was initially generated, would simply
reect back and forth between the quark and antiquark ends of the string without ever
dying away. more precisely, the linearized string would have eigenstates of oscillation
at a discrete set of frequencies n running from some lower cuto on up to innity.
in a wkb approximation, these frequencies would be determined by the requirement
that the phase factor  in (33) is real, i.e.

nzmq(nzm)4  1z 1

(38)

these oscillations must represent excited states of the dipole eld, with a mass gap
between states scaled by the dipole separation l. these states are quite analogous to
the innite tower of mesons found in the large-nc limit of ordinary qcd (where the
mass gap is set by the connement scale). on the other hand, it is quite surprising to
imagine nding an analogous set of states in a non-conning conformal gauge theory!
at this point we are led back to the questions, rst raised in the discussion of the
isolated quark in section 3, of radiation, energy conservation and back-reaction. it
is important to realize that a complete treatment of the production of time-varying
supergravity elds by a disturbance on the string must include back-reaction on the
string disturbance. to the extent that the bulk eld includes a net energy ux

5the boundary conditions appropriate for wilson loops in the ads/cft correspondence have

been discussed in [21].

12

away from the string, the back-reaction should cause the disturbance to damp as
it propagates. this process is essential to energy conservation in the supergravity
picture. let us now try to understand how this translates into energy conservation
in the gauge theory we will be led to a paradox.

focus attention again on the innite tower of excited states of the sym dipole
system, and consider the following question: are these excited states stable? to
answer this question, we will pursue two possible lines of argument. on the one
hand, within the supergravity framework we know that, once we take back-reaction
into account, the resonances will have nite widths and the notion of resonance will
only make sense if there is a limit in which the width becomes small compared to
the gap between successive states. the rate at which string disturbances radiate
is set by gs, so if we take the usual ads/cft limit gs  0 (with gsn xed), the
string will not radiate, and the excitations will be completely stable. this can be
seen explicitly in (10): the source term in the dilaton equation of motion vanishes
as gs  0 with gsn xed. we are thus led to conclude that in the n   limit
(with the t hooft coupling g2
y m n xed) there exists in the dual gauge theory an
innite tower of stable (i.e., non-radiating) excited states of the gauge eld set up by
an innitely massive quark-antiquark dipole. as we have already pointed out, this
would be analogous to what happens in conventional qcd in the large-n limit: in
the leading approximation, there is a tower of stable states in every sector of the
theory (meson, baryon, quarkonium, . . .); beyond leading order, these states acquire
nite widths proportional to some power of 1/n. it would be most remarkable if the
same structure of states survived the passage from conning qcd to non-conning
n = 4 sym (with the connement scale replaced by a variable geometric scale set
by the size of the conguration).
on the other hand, the central point of this paper is that the gkpw recipe
translates a disturbance propagating on the string into waves in the gauge theory. at
the end of the calculations one obtains sym expectation values (eq. (26), for instance)
which depend on gy m only through the t hooft coupling g2
y m n, and consequently
do not vanish 6 when gs  0. now, as discussed in section 3, the result obtained
in (26) is a near-eld contribution (it involves time-dependent elds which depend on
the velocity, but not the acceleration, of the sources), and so does not unambigously
indicate the presence of sym radiation. nonetheless, given that the ten-dimensional
static, near-, and radiation elds all come in at the same order in gs (they dier only
by their dependence on |~x|), it is natural to expect that a computation of the energy-
momentum tensor would reveal a net energy ux away from the external sources,
signaling the presence of true radiation. on the face of it, this seems to apply just as
much to the solitary oscillating quark as to the quark-antiquark excited states.

we have thus been led to a paradox:

if the gauge theory is to conserve energy,
a radiating dipole eld cannot possibly be stable. to restate the problem in slightly
dierent words, imagine that the quark in the quark-antiquark system is shaken

6the reason for this can be seen in (17): the gauge theory expectation value is extracted directly

not from the dilaton  (which vanishes as gs  0), but from the rescaled eld   /g2
s .

13

abruptly to produce a pulse running along the string, and the external charges are
held xed at all other times. in this process, a denite amount of energy is added
to the system. in the gs  0 limit, the pulse on the string will not decay, and so
it will endlessly travel back and forth between the quark and antiquark. through
the mechanism analysed in detail in this paper, this disturbance will give rise to
time-dependent sym elds which remain nite as gs  0.
if these elds include
true radiation (as seems reasonable to expect), they continuously carry energy away
from the dipole system, violating energy conservation in the gauge theory. we should
remark that, even though the paradox is most evident in the context of the quark-
antiquark system, the question of energy conservation must also be addressed in the
case of the solitary quark. in that instance, the existence of sym radiation would
not in itself be paradoxical, but it is certainly far from obvious that the innitely
broadened pulse which propagates in the gauge theory after the external charge is
shaken properly incorporates energy conservation.

what are we to make of this? in a sense, it is not surprising that we have encoun-
tered a problem: given the holographic character of the ads/cft correspondence,
the interplay between energy conservation in the bulk and on the boundary is bound
to be a delicate issue. notice that the problem would disappear if our assumption
regarding the presence of radiation turned out to be erroneous. since we have not
seen direct evidence for the existence of gauge theory radiation in the gs  0 limit,
we must bear in mind the possibility that the explicit determination of the energy-
momentum tensor will show that there is no net energy ux away from the dipole
system. this would undoubtedly be a surprising result. we will leave for future work
the more thorough analysis required to reach a denitive conclusion on this important
issue.

6 gauge fields of heavy quark baryons

in the preceding two sections, we studied the gauge elds of a color-neutral heavy
quark-antiquark pair. among other interesting things, we found in the static case that
the of 2 operator expectation value falls o with distance like |~x|7 (as compared to
the |~x|4 fallo of the same quantity around an isolated color fundamental quark).
to assess how general this result is, we will now study the state of the gauge eld
around a color-neutral collection of n quarks: the baryon of this gauge theory.

a baryon in n = 4 sym is dual to a vebrane on which n fundamental strings
terminate [22, 23]. the precise description of this system was found in ref. [24] (see
also [25]) through a study of the vebrane worldvolume action.
in this approach
the strings are faithfully represented by a specic deformation of the ux-carrying
vebrane, in accord with the born-infeld string philosophy [27, 28]. the explicit
vebrane embedding that corresponds to a baryon was found to be [24]

r() =

r0

sin  (cid:20) 3

2

(  sin  cos )(cid:21)1/3

,

14

(39)

where r = r2/z,  is the s5 polar angle, and r0 = r( = 0) is a modulus of the
conguration. since the vebrane is just as much a source of the dilaton as is the
string, we may use the logic of the earlier part of the paper to infer the gauge theory
expectation value of of 2 in the presence of a baryonic collection of heavy quarks.
the interesting question is whether this approach yields the same scaling with n and
|~x| as would the description of the baryon as a collection of quark strings.
presence of a nontrivial dilaton eld can be seen to read (in the einstein frame)

following [24], the vebrane action for an embedding of the above type in the

sd5 = t54r4z dtd sin4 {qe [r2 + r2]  e2 + 4a0},

from which e = f0 may be eliminated in favor of the displacement eld

d =

sin4 e

,

which is known explicitly as a function of :

d() =

3
2

(sin  cos   ) + sin3  cos  .

(40)

(41)

(42)

after this replacement, eq. (40) implies a linearized dilaton source term which can
be written in the form

sd5 = 

n

32 z dt d r2 + r2qd2 + sin8 ,

(43)

where we have made use of the relation t54r4 = n/32.

the embeddings of interest satisfy a bps condition [25, 24, 26], which can be used

to eliminate r in favor of r, yielding

sd5 = 

n

32 z dt d r() 

d2 + sin8 

sin4  cos   d sin !  = 

n

32 z dt dz f (z). (44)

to make contact with the discussion of the present paper, in the second step we have
reparametrized the vebrane by the poincare radial coordinate z = r2/r, implicitly
dening the function f (z).

it is important to note at this point that, unlike the string congurations dis-
cussed in previous sections, which point along a xed direction on the ve-sphere,
the vebrane has a non-trivial s5 dependence. at each value of z it lies at a dif-
ferent polar angle  = (z) determined by (39), and it is wrapped isotropically over
the remaining s4. the operator of 2 couples to the massless kaluza-klein mode of
the dilaton, so the source term given by (44) must be projected onto its spherically
symmetric component. in the case of the strings discussed in the preceding sections,
this projection would simply multiply the source term by a numerical constant. for

figure 4: from the ads5 perspective, the baryon is a fat string extending from the
boundary up to z = zm. at each value of z, the vebrane lies at a dierent polar angle on
the ve-sphere.

the vebrane, however, it introduces an additional factor of sin4 (z). the resulting
source for the massless ads5 dilaton is

j(x) =

325r5 f (z) sin4 (z)  (~x) .

it follows that the (rescaled) dilaton eld is now given by

(46)

(where the invariant distance v is given in (11)) through a familiar set of steps, one
can extract the leading behavior of  in the neighborhood of the z = 0 boundary of
ads5:

where zm = r2/r0 is the maximum value of z to which the vebrane extends.

to obtain information from (47) it is convenient to return to the initial angular

parametrization:

(48)

where the embedding r() is given by (39). the complete eld prole of the baryon
then follows from (17). from the way r4/r2 = z2 appears in the denominator of (47)
and (48) it is clear that the dilaton eld (and consequently the sym eld prole)
will have qualitatively dierent behavior in the regions |~x| > zm and |~x| < zm, so the
modulus zm in fact determines the size of the baryon, as expected from the uv/ir
connection [16, 17] (see e.g. the discussion in [29]).

notice that the dependence on |~x| and the scale size of the conguration (zm) is

feature of color-neutral objects in the n = 4 sym gauge theory. from the string
theory perspective the common origin of this behavior is clear: unlike the quark, the

7 conclusions

we have examined the correspondence between external charges in n = 4 sym
and strings in ads space. our principal focus was the connection between string
oscillations and gauge theory waves. specically, by studying the bulk radiation
given o by an undulating string, we determined the time-dependent elds produced
by an oscillating quark or a quark-antiquark pair in the strongly-coupled theory. the
picture that emerges is one in which the waves are in fact generated not only by the
external sources, but also by the non-linear medium supplied by the static background
eld of the same sources. this is in agreement with our qualitative expectations for
strongly-coupled non-abelian gauge theory. the same considerations also suggest
the existence of an innite tower of excitations in the quark-antiquark system in the
extreme maldacena limit. the status of these excitations is uncertain, pending the
resolution of some puzzles regarding energy conservation in the ads description of
the sym theory, a subject to which we hope to return.

as a side-result, we have determined the static elds produced by a quark-antiquark
pair and also by the d-brane representative of the baryon. both color-neutral sys-
tems were found to display the same long-distance behavior, and to have operator
expectation values which fall o more rapidly with distance than those of the isolated
quark.

our results provide yet another example of the remarkable way in which the
bulk-boundary correspondence manages to relate intricate aspects of the dynamics of
strongly-coupled gauge theories to properties of string theory in ads space. at the
same time, we have stressed the need for further work to unravel the precise way in
which sym energy conservation manifests itself in the dual holographic description.
