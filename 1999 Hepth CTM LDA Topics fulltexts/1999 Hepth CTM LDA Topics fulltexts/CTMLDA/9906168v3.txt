abstract

we obtain the explicit and complete bosonic non-linear kaluza-klein ansatz for the

consistent s 4 reduction of d = 11 supergravity to n = 1, d = 7 gauged supergravity. this

provides a geometrical interpretation of the lower dimensional solutions from the eleven-

dimensional point of view.

kaluza-klein dimensional reduction has enjoyed a resurgence of attention in recent years,

owing to the important role that it plays in the derivation and discussion of duality sym-

metries in string theories. for example, the non-perturbative u-duality symmetries of the

compactied string [1, 2] are understood at the level of the eective low-energy eld theory

by performing kaluza-klein reductions on toroidal internal spaces of various dimensions.

one makes contact with the conjectured non-perturbative bps congurations of the string

by showing that there exist corresponding soliton solutions of the lower-dimensional theo-

ries, which preserve some fraction of the supersymmetry. a crucial aspect of the reduction

procedure is that it is consistent, which ensures that solutions of the lower-dimensional equa-

tions of motion will also be solutions of the original more fundamental higher-dimensional

ones.

recently, a new duality was conjectured, relating supergravities in anti-de sitter (ads)

backgrounds to superconformal eld theories on the boundary [3, 4, 5]. the relevant super-

gravities are gauged theories, which are believed to arise from the kaluza-klein reduction

of string theory or m-theory on certain spherical internal spaces. it again becomes crucial

to know whether the reduction is a consistent one, since this is important for establishing

the details of the link between the supergravity theory in the bulk, and the conformal eld

theory on the boundary.

in the case of toroidal internal spaces, the consistency of the reduction procedure is

guaranteed by simple group-theoretic arguments. the consistency of the kaluza-klein
sphere reduction of supergravities on adssphere is more subtle to address, since there
indeed, there are
appears to be no simple group-theoretic argument that guarantees it.

simple arguments which demonstrate that the reduction and truncation of a generic theory

on a sphere will denitely be inconsistent.

in fact it is only because of very remarkable

conspiracies between the various terms in the higher-dimensional supergravity theories

that the consistent truncation is possible at all.

the original discussions of sphere reductions in supergravity considered only the lin-
earised uctuations around a xed adssphere background [6, 7], for which no possibility
indications of the remarkable underlying structures that lead to
of inconsistency arises.

the consistency at the full non-linear level were seen in studies that examined leading-order

non-linear contributions [8]. the exact consistent ansatze for n = 2 and n = 3 trunca-

tions of the n = 8 supersymmetric s 7 reduction of d = 11 supergravity were obtained in

[9, 10]. a complete demonstration of the consistency was presented in [11], although the

construction was highly implicit, and did not lend itself to the explicit re-interpretation

1

of lower-dimensional solutions in terms of eleven-dimensional ones. results for the full

non-linear ansatz just for the metric in certain sphere reductions were also obtained in

[12, 13, 14, 15].

recently, the rst examples of complete and explicit non-trivial reductions were pre-

sented, for s 7 and s 4 compactications of m-theory and an s 5 compactication of the type

iib string [16].1 in each case, it was possible to obtain explicit results by making further

truncations in which only elds associated with the cartan subalgebras of the non-abelian

yang-mills gauge groups were retained. thus in the s 7, s 4 and s 5 reductions only the

gauge elds of u (1)4, u (1)2 and u (1)3 respectively were retained. these reductions were

sucient, however, for allowing the re-interpretation of certain non-trivial bps solutions of

the lower-dimensional supergravities as solutions in d = 11 or d = 10. in particular, it was

shown that charged ads black-holes in the lower dimensions could be interpreted as the

near-horizon limits of corresponding rotating m-branes or d3-brane in d = 11 and d = 10

[17, 16].

the construction in [16] showed that the reduction must be performed at the level of the

higher-dimensional equations of motion, rather than the lagrangian (even when it exists).

furthermore, it also demonstrated how the consistency of the reduction depends crucially

on conspiracies involving an interplay between the various elds in the higher-dimensional

theory, and emphasised the fact that the kaluza-klein reduction of a generic theory on

a sphere would, by contrast, be inconsistent.

in this letter, we shall consider the kaluza-klein reduction of eleven-dimensional super-

gravity on s 4. a complete kaluza-klein reduction ansatz for the s 4 compactication to

n = 2 gauged supergravity in d = 7 was recently presented [18]. although much simpler

than the corresponding ansatz for the s 7 reduction in [11], owing to the smaller dimension

of the sphere, it is still quite a complicated construction. here, we shall consider a some-

what simpler situation, where we still reduce d = 11 supergravity on s 4, but where we

truncate to the bosonic elds of n = 1 gauged supergravity. these comprise the metric, a

dilatonic scalar eld, a 3-form potential and the gauge elds of su (2) yang-mills. this is

1we dene non-trivial reductions to mean ones that involve scalar elds that parameterise inhomo-

geneous deformations of the compactifying sphere, implying that the consistency of the reduction will not

be explicable purely by a simple group-invariance argument. furthermore, we emphasise the completeness

of the reduction ansatz because it is only when one has the full set of non-linear expressions, including

in particular the ansatze for the higher-dimensional eld strengths as well as the metric, that one is able

to obtain a consistent reduction. the metric sector by itself gives rise to inconsistencies that are resolved

only by virtue of miraculous conspiracies between the higher-dimensional metric and antisymmetric tensor

elds.

2

still a non-trivial reduction, in that the scalar eld parameterises inhomogeneous deforma-

tions of the 4-sphere, and the gauge elds of a non-abelian yang-mills group are retained.

in addition, the emergence of the topological mass term for the 3-form potential can be

seen. nonetheless, the construction is completely explicit, and any solution of the seven-

dimensional equations of motion can be straightforwardly re-interpreted back in d = 11.

note that the embedding that we shall discuss in this letter is qualitatively dierent from

the one presented in [18], in that we give our ansatz on the 3-form potential and metric of

the eleven-dimensional theory in its original second-order formulation, rather than in the

new rst-order formalism presented in [18].

our starting point is the bosonic sector of eleven-dimensional supergravity, which is

described by the lagrangian [19]

l11 = r 1l  1

2  f(4)  f(4)  1

6

f(4)  f(4)  a(3) ,

(1)

where f(4) = d a(3), and we use hats to denote eleven-dimensional elds and the eleven-
dimensional hodge dual . the equations of motion following from this lagrangian are

rm n = 1
d f(4) = 1

12 ( f 2
m n  1
f(4)  f(4) .

12

2

f 2

(4) gm n ) ,

(2)

we obtained the ansatz for the reduction to the bosonic sector of n = 1 gauged super-

gravity in d = 7 by rst taking the results for the u (1)2 abelian truncation given in [16],

setting the two scalars x1 and x2 of that theory equal, and also the two u (1) gauge elds.

having done this, the metric on the internal 4-sphere takes the form

ds2

4 = x 3  d2 + 1

4 x1 cos2 (cid:16)d2 + sin2  d2 + (d + cos  d  g a(1))2(cid:17) ,

(3)

where x = e/10 parameterises the scalar eld in terms of a canonically-normalised
dilaton , and

 = x4 sin2  + x cos2  .

(4)

at x = 1, in the absence of the u (1) gauge eld a(1), this metric describes a unit 4-

sphere as a foliation of 3-spheres that are parameterised by euler angles (, , ), with

latitude coordinate . the 3-sphere itself is a u (1) bundle over the 2-sphere with metric

d2 + sin2  d2, with  as the coordinate on the u (1) bres. when the 7-dimensional scalar

x is excited, it describes inhomogeneous deformations of the 4-sphere, leaving the 3-sphere

foliations intact. excitations of the u (1) gauge eld a(1) in seven dimensions describe

deformations of the 3-spheres u (1) bundle.

3

it is now natural to consider a non-abelian generalisation of the deformations of the
4-sphere metric, by introducing the three left-invariant 1-forms i on s 3, which satisfy
di =  1
2 ijk j  k. these can be written in terms of the euler angles as 1 + i 2 =
ei (d + i sin  d), 3 = d + cos  d. we are naturally led to generalise (3) to

ds2

note that this reduces to (3) in the abelian limit where the i = 1 and i = 2 components of
the su (2) gauge potentials ai

having established our notation, we can now present our ansatze for the d = 11 metric

a remark about the truncation that we are performing is in order here. what is required

is the truncation to the pure n = 1 supergravity multiplet in d = 7. as discussed in [20],

the 3-form a(3), which is massive, would have 20 on-shell degrees of freedom if it satised an

ordinary second-order eld equation. however, the 3-form eld in the supergravity multiplet

should have only 10 on-shell degrees of freedom. this is achieved by requiring that it satisfy

a rst order eld equation; the so-called odd-dimensional self-duality equation [21]. in

the presence of the su (2) yang-mills elds, we nd that this equation will be

x 4 f(4) =  12

g a(3) + 1

2 (3) .

(10)

since the imposition of this equation is part of our truncation procedure, we are free to

impose it, if we wish, when writing down the expressions for the eleven-dimensional elds.
this we have done in writing f(4) and

f(4) above.

we nd that the equation of motion for f(4), given in (2), implies the following seven-

dimensional equations:

g f(4) + 1

(2)  f i

10 x2 f i

5 x 4 f(4)  f(4)  1

d(x1 dx) = 1
d(x 4 f(4)) =  12
d(x2 f i
where d denotes the gauge-covariant exterior derivative, di = di + g ijk aj
(1)  k. note
that the second-order equation for a(3) here is nothing but the exterior derivative of the

substituting the ansatze (6) and (8) into the eleven-dimensional einstein equation in

(2), we again obtain the equations of motion for the scalar x and the yang-mills elds ai

(1),

as in (11), together with the seven-dimensional einstein equation

where we have replaced x by x = e/10, together with the self-duality condition (10),
which is to be imposed after having obtained the equations of motion from (14). this set

of equations of motion precisely describe the bosonic sector of n = 1 gauged supergravity

in seven dimensions. the lagrangian (14) was also given in [22].

the fact that we have been able to extract seven-dimensional equations of motion by

substituting (6) and (8) into the eleven-dimensional equations of motion demonstrates that

our reduction ansatze are consistent. in other words, the eleven-dimensional equations of

motion are satised by all the eld congurations given in (6) and (8), provided that the

seven-dimensional elds satisfy the equations of motion of n = 1 gauged supergravity. it

is worth emphasising that the ability to extract seven-dimensional equations of motion in

a consistent manner depends crucially on the interplay between the contributions of the

three terms in the eleven-dimensional lagrangian (1), which leads to a precise matching,

and hence factoring-out, of the dependence on the coordinates of the internal 4-sphere

in the eleven-dimensional equations of motion.
coecient of the f(4)

in particular, the specic value of the
a(3) term in (1) is crucial. since the magnitude of this term is also

f(4)

uniquely determined by supersymmetry, the calculations that we have presented here again

support the notion that the consistency of non-trivial sphere reductions is closely related

to supersymmetry [23].

our approach to nding the correct ansatz, and verifying that it gives a consistent re-

duction, has been to substitute it into the eleven-dimensional equations of motion, and then

to verify that these are satised provided the lower-dimensional equations of motion are sat-

ised. this, by denition, is what one means by consistency. an alternative approach that

is sometimes discussed is to substitute the ansatz into the higher-dimensional lagrangian,

and integrate over the coordinates of the internal space. of course before doing this, one

would rst have to nd an independent argument for why the ansatz was a consistent one.

(as is well known, the mere fact that one obtains a sensible-looking lower-dimensional ac-

tion by substituting an ansatz into the higher-dimensional one does not, of itself, guarantee

that the ansatz is consistent.) since we have constructed an explict consistent reduction

ansatz in this letter, it is of interest to see what would happen if one were to substitute it

into the eleven-dimensional action.

first, let us simplify the discussion by restricting just to the gravity plus scalar sector

of the seven-dimensional theory. substituting the ansatze (6) and (7) into the eleven-
dimensional lagrangian (1), we nd l11 = 1

2 ()2 + w )g3 g7, where

2 g4 cos3  (r  1

+4 cos2  (7 + 3 sin2 ) x 10 + 24 cos4  x 15(cid:17) .

(15)

integrating over , one indeed obtains the correct gravity plus scalar sector of the seven-

dimensional lagrangian (14).2 however, once the gauge elds are included in the reduction

ansatz, the substitution of (6) and (7) into the eleven-dimensional action will not give rise

to the seven-dimensional action (14). all these defects are avoided by sticking with the

equations of motion.

in this letter, we have presented an explicit and consistent fully non-linear reduction

ansatz for the compactication of eleven-dimensional supergravity on s 4, with a truncation

to n = 1 gauged supergravity in d = 7. in particular, we have shown how the dilaton 

parameterises inhomogeneous deformations of the 4-sphere that leave the foliating 3-spheres

undistorted. on the other hand, the su (2) gauge elds that form the surviving subgroup of

the so(5) yang-mills elds of the maximal gauged theory are associated with deformations

that correspond to right-translations under the su (2) that acts on the 3-spheres. using

this geometrical embedding of the seven-dimensional theory in the eleven-dimensional one,

it is now possible to re-express any solution of the seven-dimensional n = 1 gauged theory

as a solution in the low-energy limit of m-theory.

and the procedure of substituting the ansatz into the action is problematical even in the scalar sector [24].
