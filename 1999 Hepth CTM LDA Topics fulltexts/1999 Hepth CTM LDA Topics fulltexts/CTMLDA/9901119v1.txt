abstract

we study quantum dilaton coupled spinors in two and four dimensions.
making classical transformation of metric, dilaton coupled spinor theory is
transformed to minimal spinor theory with another metric and in case of
4d spinor also in the background of the non-trivial vector eld. this gives
the possibility to calculate 2d and 4d dilaton dependent conformal (or weyl)
anomaly in easy way. anomaly induced eective action for such spinors is de-
rived. in case of 2d, the eective action reproduces, without any extra terms,
the term added by hands in the quantum correction for rst model, which
is exactly solvable. for 4d spinor the chiral anomaly which depends explic-
itly from dilaton is also found. as some application we discuss susy black
holes in dilatonic supergravity with wz type matter and hawking radiation
in the same theory. as another application we investigate spherically reduced
einstein gravity with 2d dilaton coupled fermion anomaly induced eective
action and show the existence of quantum corrected schwarszchild-de sitter
(sds) (nariai) bh with multiple horizon.

1 introduction

spherical reduction of einstein gravity (see, for example [1]) with minimal
matter leads to some 2d dilatonic gravity (for most general action, see [2])
with 2d dilaton coupled matter. then, applying s-wave approximation one is
forced to study 2d quantum dilaton coupled theory. having in mind mainly
cosmological applications, conformal anomaly may be one of the most impor-
tant objects to study in such theory. for 2d dilaton coupled scalar the confor-
mal (or weyl) anomaly has been found in ref.[3] and later in refs.[4, 5, 6, 7].
using it, one can nd anomaly induced, dilaton dependent eective action
[4, 5, 6] (see also later work [8] where this eective action has been rederived).
anomaly induced eective action has been applied to investigate the follow-
ing remarkable problems: hawking radiation [9] in dilatonic supergravity
[6], anti-evaporation of multiple horizon black holes [10, 11], discussion of
semi-classical energy-momentum tensor in the presence of dilaton [12], etc.
in the present paper we investigate the conformal anomaly for 2d and 4d
dilaton coupled spinors. naive transformation of quantum spinor (inclusion
of dilatonic function to fermion) seems to indicate that no dilaton dependent
terms appear in conformal anomaly for dilaton coupled spinor [3, 6, 13]. un-
fortunately it is not quite correct and jacobian of quantum transformation is
lost in this way. in this work, making only classical transformation of exter-
nal classical gravitational eld, we map dilaton coupled fermion to minimal
fermion in the another classical gravitational background. (no transforma-
tion of quantum elds is made). then, calculation of conformal anomaly
may be done in quite straitforward way. in case of 2d, the anomaly induced
eective action is derived. the eective action reproduces the term added by
hands in the quantum correction for rst model[14], which is exactly solv-
able. adding such eective action to reduced einstein gravity, i.e. working in
large n and s-wave approximation we derive quantum corrected sds (nar-
iai) bh. the structure of theory under investigation shows the possibility of
anti-evaporation of such bh in analogy with results of refs. [10, 11].

the paper is organised as follows. in the next section we calculate the
conformal anomaly and induced action for 2d dilaton coupled fermion. com-
parizon with 2d scalar is made. the possibility of realization for quantum
part of rst model as fermion anomaly induced eective action is shown.
quantum corrected sds bh is also constructed.

section 3 is devoted to short discussion of bhs in dilatonic supergravity

2

with wz type matter. energy-momentum tensor components are found and
hawking radiation is derived. in section 4 we evaluate conformal and chiral
anomaly as well as induced action for 4d dilaton coupled fermion. its explicit
dilaton dependence is demonstrated. finally, some discussion is presented in
last section.

2 conformal anomaly for 2d dilaton coupled

spinor

let us start from 2d dilaton coupled spinor lagrangian:

l = gf () 

(1)

where  is 2d majorana spinor, f () is an arbitrary function and  is dilaton.
let us make now the following classical transformation of background

eld g:

(2)
then it is easy to see that (x)  f ()(x) and in terms of new classical
metric we obtain usual, non-coupled with dilaton (minimal) lagrangian for
2d spinor:

g  f 2()g .

the conformal anomaly for lagrangian (3) is well-known:

l = qg  .

qgt =

g
24 (cid:26)1

2

r(cid:27) .

now, transforming eq.(4) to original variables:

g = f 2()g ,

r = f 2() (r  2 ln f )

(3)

(4)

(5)

we get the following conformal anomaly for dilaton coupled majorana spinor
(1):

gt =

hence, we found the conformal anomaly for 2d dilaton coupled majorana
spinor.

above result corrects the error in refs.[3, 6, 13] where conclusion was made
that for dilaton coupled spinor no new dilaton dependent terms appear in
conformal anomaly if compare with minimal spinor. note also that for 2d
dilaton coupled dirac spinor the conformal anomaly is twice of eq.(6).

in the conformal anomaly (6) dilaton dependent terms appear in the form
of total derivative. in principle, it means that this term is ambiguious by
physical reasons. indeed, in two dimensions the analogue of einstein action
looks like:

now, there exists the following relation

s =

1

g z d2xgrf () .

(7)

(8)

g



g z d2xgrf () = f () .

in other words, by nite renormalization of gravitational action (7), we can
always change the coecient of f term in conformal anomaly. so in 2d
gravity this term is only xed by the physical renormalization condition.
that is why total derivative term of conformal anomaly for dilaton coupled
scalar is ambigious.

now we discuss anomaly induced eective action for dilaton coupled
spinor. the derivation goes in the same way as it was for dilaton coupled
scalar [4, 5]. making the conformal transformation of the metric g  e2g
in the trace anomaly, and using relation

gt =




w []

(9)

one can nd the anomaly induced eective action w . in the covariant, non-
local form it may be written as following:

w = 

1

2 z d2xg(cid:26) 1
+ f2() 

96
f3()

r

r

r + rz f3()d) (10)

where

f2() = 

f f  f 2
24f 2

, f3() = 

f 

24f

.

(11)

4

note that coecient of second term is actually zero as is easy to check.
hence, we got anomaly induced eective action for dilaton coupled spinor.

an interesting thing is that the eective action (10) exactly reproduces
the eective action of rst model [14], which is exactly solvable. the rst
model is given by adding the quantum correction

wrst = 

1

2 z d2xg(cid:26) n

r(cid:27)

to the action of the cghs model [15]

scghs =

1

2 z d2xge2(cid:16)r + 4 + 42(cid:17) .

(12)

(13)

in [14], the second term in wrst (12) is added by hands. in the work by
bousso-hawking [4], it has been found that the there appears the third term
in (10), which corresponds to the second term in (12), from the conformal
anomaly of the dilaton coupled scalar elds but there always appears the
second term in (10), which makes the model not to be exactly solvable, again.
as found here, however, if we consider only dilaton coupled (2n) spinor elds
as a matter to cghs model [15], the model becomes exactly solvable even
when we include quantum corrections and has the exact quantum solutions,
in the conformal gauge :

g =

(15)

here we neglect the quantum correction form the dilaton and graviton. simi-
larly, changing classical part of the model by the spherically reduced action of
einstein gravity one can nd 2d bhs in such model with quantum correction.
however, now such 2d bhs will get 4d interpretation.

as an example we consider spherically reduced einstein gravity with the
quantum correction (12) from 2n (n in 4d) spinors. the equations of motion

are given by the variation over g, g+ and . they have the following form
in the conformal gauge (14) :

(16)

(17)

(18)

now we investigate if there exists a nariai or sds type solution [16] for
above equations. for this purpose, we assume  is a constant:  = 0. then
eqs.(17) and (18) can be rewritten as follows:

0 =

0 =

2n g  1!1

comparing (19) with (20), we obtain

.

(19)

(20)

(21)

the sign  in (21) should be + if we require the solution coincides with the
classical one e20 = 1
 in the classical limit of n  0. then from (19) or
(20), we nd

e2 =

2c
r0

1

cosh2(cid:16)rc(cid:17)

.

(22)

here c > 0 is a constant of the integration and r0 is 2d scalar curvature,
which is given by

r0 = 2e2r =

(23)

(the sign  corresponds to (21).) it is straightforward to check that the
solution in (21) and (22) satises eq.(16). the 4d curvature r4 is also given
by

r4 = r0 + 2e20 =

(24)

above spherically reduced einstein gravity with fermion quantum correc-
tion (in large n and s-wave approximation) acquires the structure carefully
studied in the model by bousso-hawking [11].
it is easy to repeat liter-
ally the same investigation as in ref.[11] and to show the possibility of anti-
evaporation of nariai bh due to quantum spinors.
(note that ref.[11] is
dealing with only quantum dilaton coupled scalars). this study is even sim-
pler as two terms of induced eective action for 2d dilaton coupled scalars
simply do not appear for the spinor case. so it is not necessary to adopt
approximation where these two terms disappear for the study of quantum
equations of motion.

for comparison we give here also conformal anomaly and induced eective

action for dilaton coupled scalar a with lagrangian:

l = fs()gaa .

using results of refs.[3, 4], one can write down:

gt =

g
24 (r  3 f 
fs 

s

f 
s
2f 2

s ! ()()  3

(25)

(26)

anomaly induced eective action is given by eq.(10), where coecient of the
rst term is

1
48 (i.e. twice bigger), and

f2() =

(27)

now, having at hands conformal anomaly for 2d dilaton coupled spinor and
scalar we may discuss specic models.

3 susy black holes and hawking radiation

we will start from the theory of the dilatonic supergravity with wz type
matter. the corresponding action has been constructed in ref.[6] using mod-
ied form of tensor calculus (for the introduction, see [17]).

working on purely bosonic background (but still keeping fermions in mat-
ter sector) we may write the dierent versions of above dilatonic sg with
matter. one of them is actually susy generalization [18, 19] of cghs model
[15] :

l =   v +
f ()

c()r

2

+ (z + 3z )()()

n

xi=1h(ai)(ai) + iii!

(28)

(29)

where v = cs2  c f s  zf 2  v f , c() = 2e2, z() = 4e2,
v () = 4e2. using the equations of motion with respect to the auxilliary
elds, we obtain

s = 0 , f =  .

we consider the situation where metric and dilaton are background elds
and matter is quantized. then, one can work in large n approximation.
the anomaly induced eective action due to n scalars and spinors may be
derived from eqs.(10), (27) as the following:

w =

r ln f) .

(30)

r 

due to missing fermionic contribution the coecient of last term in (30) is
slightly dierent if compare with the result written in [6].

the total eective action is given by sum of anomaly induced eective
action w and some conformally invariant functional which may be dened
in schwinger-de witt expansion. the leading term of this expansion for
fermion is actually zero unlike the scalar. there are indications that this
conformal invariant functional is exactly zero for dilaton coupled spinor, as
it is impossible to construct conformal invariant combinations from dilaton

8

and at derivatives (no massive coupling constants) with more than two
derivatives. the corresponding sd coecient on at background for spinor
is total derivative as is shown above. the exact solvability of rst model
indicates the same.

we investigate the correction from the previous results in ref.[6] due to
the missing fermion contribution. as a matter elds, we use dilaton coupled
matter supermultiplet, which is natural as a toy model of the 4d models but
is dierent from the original cghs model. we are interested in the change
of the estimation of the back-reaction from such a matter supermultiplet
to black holes and hawking radiation working in large-n approximation.
since we are interested in the vacuum (black hole) solution, we consider
the background where matter elds, the rarita-schwinger eld and dilatino
vanish.

in the superconformal gauge, the equations of motion in [6] obtained by
the variation over g, g and  are slightly changed. we should also note
that there is, in general, a contribution from the auxilliary elds to t
besides the contribution from the trace anomaly.

in large-n limit, where classical part can be ignored, eld equations be-

come simpler and we can nd the explicit solutions:

h() = z d

.

(31)

here  is an arbitrary function of x = t  x. comparing with the results
in [6], the coecients in (31) are slightly changed but the essential behavior
does not change. for example, the scalar curvature is given by

r = 8e2+

(+(x+) + (x))

(32)

note that when +(x+) + (x) = 0, there is a curvature singularity. es-
pecially if we choose

+(x+) =

r0
x+

, (x) = 

x
r0

(33)

9

there are curvature singularities at x+x = r2
0 and horizon at x+ = 0 or
x = 0. hence we got black hole solution in the model under discussion. the
asymptotically at regions are given by x+  + (x < 0) or x  
(x+ > 0).
we now consider hawking radiation. we investigate the case that f () =
e (h() = ). hawking radiation can be obtained by substituting the
classical black hole solution which appeared in the original cghs model [15]

(where m is the mass of the black hole and we used asymptotic at coor-
dinates) into the quantum part of the energy momentum tensor. we use
eq.(29). then we nd that when +  +, the energy momentum tensor
behaves as

t q

t q

2 + t() .

(35)

here t() is a function which is determined by the boundary condition.
in order to evaluate t(), we impose a boundary condition that there is
no incoming energy. this condition requires that t q
++ should vanish at the
past null innity (  ) and if we assume t() is black hole mass
independent, t q
 should also vanish at the past horizon (+  ) after
taking m  0 limit. then we nd

t() = 

n 22

16

(36)

and one obtains

t q
  0

(37)
at the future null innity (+  +). eqs.(35) and (37) might tell that
there is no hawking radiation in the dilatonic supergravity model under
discussion when quantum back-reaction of matter supermultiplet in large-n
approach is taken into account as in [6]. (that indicates that above black
hole is extremal one). from another side since we work in strong coupling
regime it could be that new methods to study hawking radiation should be
developed.

4 conformal and chiral anomaly for 4d dila-

ton coupled spinor

we consider now 4d dilaton coupled fermion which may appear as the result
of spherical reduction of higher dimensional minimal spinor. the correspond-
ing lagrangian may be taken as follows:

l = gf () (x)

(38)

where  =  + 1
the action (38) is conformally invariant.

2 ab

 ab unlike the case of 2d majorana spinor. note that

let us make the following transformation of background gravitational

eld:

g = e2(x)g , (x) = e(x)(x) , g = e4(x)qg .

it is easy to check then that

 ab(cid:19) = e(x)(cid:18) +

(40)

(note that review of conformal transformations in 4d gravity may be found
in ref.[20].) let us select (x) to satisfy

e3(x)f () = 1 .

then, lagrangian (38) after transformation (39) takes the form:

(41)

(42)

l = qgh (x)  +  ai

where we used    and a = 3
2 (x). note that eld strength for above
vector eld is equal to zero, that is why no terms of the sort-square of eld
strength for above vector appear in conformal anomaly. hence, the calcula-
tion of a2 schwinger-de witt coecient in theory (38) in curved spacetime
with nontrivial dilaton is equivalent to the calculation of a2 is an external
gravitational eld g (but no dilaton) and external vector eld a.

let us write the above lagrangian as the following:

l = qgh  di

11

(43)

where d =  + a. we got the usual system: fermion in curved spacetime
with the abelian external vector eld. conformal anomaly for such quantum
(dirac) fermion is well-known:

where f = r r  2 r r + 1
r2, g = r r  4 r r + r2.
one can also present coecients of conformal anomaly as b =
20(4)2 and
360(4)2 . and in principle, one can add  r (total derivative) term
b =  11
with arbitrary coecient to eq.(44). it is known that coecient of this term
may be changed by nite renormalization of r2-term in gravitational action,
so it is ambigious.

now, one can transform the relation (44) back to original metric tensor

(45)
then g f  gf ,

where  =  1

hence, we found conformal anomaly for 4d dilaton coupled spinor.

it
is easy to see that there are dilaton dependent contributions to conformal
anomaly. one can also nd anomaly induced eective action for dilaton

12

coupled 4d spinor. starting from eq.(44) for conformal anomaly in terms of
tilded metric the corresponding anomaly induced action in this case is quite
known (see [21]):

(47)

it is trivial to substitute metric g = e2g,  =  1
3 ln f () and rewrite
above equation in terms of original metric and dilaton function. we do not
do this in order to save the place.

as nal remark, we note that similarly one can calculate the chiral
anomaly for dilaton coupled spinor. chiral anomaly for theory (42) is known
[22, 17, 23]:

hence we found explicitly dilaton dependent corrections for chiral anomaly
in the theory of 4d dilaton coupled spinor.

5 discussion

in summary, we found the conformal anomaly and induced eective action
for 2d and 4d dilaton coupled spinor as well as 4d chiral anomaly. the dilaton
dependent part of conformal anomaly for 2d non-minimal spinor is shown to
be the total derivative. as the result corresponding induced eective action
has very simple form.
it consists of two terms: polyakov term and rst
term which has been suggested as phenomenological, ad hoc term some time

13

ago [14]. hence, well-known rst model or, more exactly, some its simple
modications (in classical part) which were thought to be just 2d toy models
acquire new remarkable interpretation. this model may be considered now
as spherically reduced 4d gravity with spherically reduced minimal spinor (s-
wave and large n approximation is used). in other words, rst-like model
may be applied to study 4d gravity (in above approximation). we give the
example of such sort showing the possibility to realize quantum corrected
sds (nariai) bh in reduced einstein gravity with quantum correction due
to large n spinors. actually we work with 2d dilatonic bh which may be
re-interpreted as 4d bh without dilaton.
it is very interesting that this
solution may be also rewritten as cosmological solution which describes 4d
kantowski-sachs universe. corresponding investigation will be presented
elsewhere.

similarly, one can consider anomaly induced eective action for 4d dilaton
coupled spinor to investigate quantum dilaton cosmology (no s-wave approx-
imation then). in particulary, it would be very interesting to answer: can
such fermions help in resolution of singularity problem via realization of non-
singular universes with non-trivial dilaton.
