(february 1, 2008)

we show that smooth domain wall spacetimes supported by a scalar eld separating two anti-
de-sitter like regions admit a single graviton bound state. our analysis yields a fully non-linear
supergravity treatment of the randall-sundrum model. our solutions describe a pp-wave propa-
gating in the domain wall background spacetime. if the latter is bps, our solutions retain some
supersymmetry. nevertheless, the kaluza-klein modes generate pp curvature singularities in the
bulk located where the horizon of ads would ordinarily be.

i. introduction

it has long been thought that any attempt to model
the universe as a single brane embedded in a higher-
dimensional bulk spacetime must inevitably fail because
the gravitational forces experienced by matter on the
brane, being mediated by gravitons travelling in the
bulk, are those appropriate to the higher dimensional
spacetime rather than the lower dimensional brane. re-
cently however, randall and sundrum have argued that
there are circumstances under which this need not be
so. their model involves a thin distributional static
at domain wall or three-brane separating two regions of
ve-dimensional anti-de-sitter spacetime. they solve for
the linearized graviton perturbations and nd a square
integrable bound state representing a gravitational wave
conned to the domain wall. they also found the lin-
earized bulk or kaluza-klein graviton modes. they
argue that the latter decouple from the brane and make
negligible contribution to the force beween two sources
in the brane, so that this force is due primarily to the
bound state. in this way we get an inverse square law
attraction rather than the inverse cube law one might
naively have anticipated (see [3] for a related discussion).
this result is rather striking and raises various ques-
tions. for example one would like to know how general
the eect is. is it just an eect of the linearized pertur-
bations or does it persist when non-linearities are taken
into account? one would expect to get only one massless
spin two bound state if the eective theory on the brane
is to be general relativity. in their derivation a crucial
role is played by a delta-function in the linearized gravi-
ton equation of motion. this is responsible for the unique
bound state. it also seems that the eect will only work
for domain walls and not for other branes. however the

full dynamics of the domain wall is not treated in detail in
the randall-sundrum model. in fact gravitating domain
walls have a drastic eect on the curvature of the ambi-
ent spacetime and it is not obvious that a simple model
involving a single collective coordinate representing the
transverse displacement of the domain wall is valid.

for these reasons it seems desirable to have a simple
non-singular model which is exactly solvable. it is the
purpose of this note to provide that.

note that the spacetime is uniquely specied by giv-
ing a solution of (2.6) which is the same as the equation
for a domain wall in the absence of gravity. one then
obtains a by quadratures. the vacua correspond to crit-
ical points of the superpotential w . at these points the
potential v is negative, and so one is in an anti-de-sitter
phase. recently, there has been a lot of interest in the
possibility of obtaining such potentials within the con-
text of d = 5 gauged supergravity models ( [5], [6], [12],
[7]. at present no superpotential with the correct prop-
erties derived from a supergravity model has yet been
found. however a solution was exhibited in [4] which is
not derived from a supergravity model. we will return
to this point in the last section. we will now show, with-
out assuming that it is supersymmetric or satises the
rst order equations, how to superpose a smooth domain
wall background with plane-fronted gravitational waves
moving in the anti-de-sitter background.

iii. pp-waves on the brane: the bound

state

an exact solution of einsteins equations representing
a gravitional wave moving at the speed of light in the x1
direction is given by retaining the form (r) and a(r)
but modifying the metric (2.2) to take the form:

ds2 = dr2 + e2a(r)(cid:16)dudv + h(u, r, xi

)du2 + dxi

dxi

(cid:17),
(3.1)

with u = t  x1, v = t + x1, i = 2, . . . , d  3 and where
the u dependence of h is arbitrary but its dependence
upon r and xi

 is governed by

2

where 2
 is the at laplace operator in the coordinates
xi
. this will have half as much supersymmetry as the
domain wall background. one may further generalize
this solution by replacing the at metric dxi
 by an
arbitary (d  3)-dimensional ricci at metric g. if g
admits covariantly constant spinors, then the background
will still admit some supersymmetry.

dxi

if g is at space, solutions of (3.2) propagate in sur-
faces of constant r at the speed of light in the (arbi-
trarily chosen) x1 direction with an amplitude depend-
ing upon r. fourier analyzing in the x direction gives
h  eikx, where k could in principle depend upon u. if
k is real, solutions would propagate faster than light in a
given r =constant surface, and would appear as tachyons
to an observer on the brane. on the other hand, solu-
tions for which k is pure imaginary propagate on the
brane like kaluza-klein modes. thus, if k2 = m2, i.e.,
2

h = m2h, we are led to the equation

h  + (d  1)h a + e2am2h = 0.

(3.3)

xj

consider the zero modes, i.e., solutions with m2 = 0.
we take h = f (r)hij (u)xi
 and nd that f =
c1 + c2 r r dse(d1)a(s) where c1 and c2 are constants.
the graviton perturbation h = e2ah will diverge ex-
ponentially for large values of |r| unless c2 = 0. we will
return to this divergence in the next section. the mode
for which c2 = 0 and c1 = 1 and

h = hij(u)xi

xj



(3.4)

may be identied as a fully non-linear version of the zero
mode of randall and sundrum on a general domain wall
background. here, hij (u) is an arbitrary trace free sym-
metric matrix which determines the polarization state
of the graviton. the choice (3.4) is made so that the
solution has a d-dimensional isometry group acting on
the surfaces r =constant, u =constant. this invariance
is not manifest in the coordinates (r, u, v, x), but is in
rosen coordinates [14] (u, v, x), in which (3.1), given
(3.4), assumes the form

ds2 = dr2 + e2a(dudv + aij (u)dxi

dxj

)

(3.5)

aij (u)xi

j = hikp k

i =

p i
j(u),  denotes
dierentiation with respect to u and the matrix p i
j(u)
is a solution of p i
j. to make contact with
( [2], [1]), we linearize, setting pij = ij + 1
2 ij so that
ij = hij. the quantity  is essentially the perturba-
tion considered in ( [1]). rosen coordinates are in general
rather pathological at the non-linear level and awkward
to use. in our non-linear analysis we shall, from now on,
only use the coordinates (r, u, v, x).

iv. pp-waves in the bulk: blueshift and

curvature singularities

our spacetimes are timelike and lightlike geodesically
incomplete as |r|  .
in the absence of gravita-
tional waves, i.e., h = 0, r =  corresponds to a reg-
ular cauchy horizon, and the solution may be extended
through the horizon (see for example [17]). if h6=0 how-
ever, the solutions will generically become singular as
|r|  , and will not admit an extension. the nature
of this singularity is most easily studied when the back-
ground is taken to be exactly adsd. if we let z = aer/a
then the metric (3.1) can be recast in so-called siklos
coordinates [15]:

ds2 =

a2
z2 (dz2  dudv + hdu2 + dxi

dxi

),

(4.1)

where h now satises the generalized siklos equation

z(d2) 
z

[

1

zd2

h
z

] + 2

h = 0.

because all invariants formed from the weyl tensor of
(4.1) necessarily vanish, it is not possible to detect cur-
vature singularities directly by calculating invariants.
however, the necessary condition that one may extend
through the singularity in the metric at z =  is that
the components of the riemann tensor in an orthonor-
mal frame which has been parallelly propagated along
every timelike geodesic are nite. this requirement
arises because freely falling observers move along timelike
geodesics, and the components of the curvature tensor
will measure the tidal forces which these observers expe-
rience. following the demonstration in [15], one may cal-
culate these terms explicitly for the siklos metrics. one
nds that certain frame components of the riemann ten-
sor generically assume the form

r(a)(b)(a)(b) =



d  1

z5(

1
z

h
z

),z

(4.2)

where we have suppressed various constants which are
irrelevant to this discussion. it follows that any solution
with z-dependence cannot be extended, and hence is sin-
gular. one sees that the z-dependent piece of (4.2) is the
contribution from the weyl tensor.
it would therefore
seem that the gravitons will be heavily blueshifted as
we move towards large values of z.

h = m2h, the siklos equation has solutions of

if 2
the form

h = z

d1

2 eikx[d1j d1

2

(mz) + d2y d1

2

(mz)],

(4.3)

where jn(x) and yn(x) are bessel functions, and d1, d2
are some constants. the z-dependence of h has the same
form as the kaluza-klein modes of ( [2], [1]). the be-
haviour near z =  shows that these are singular on the
cauchy horizon.

3

in order to get a better feel for the singular nature of
these spacetimes, it is useful to focus on a specic ex-
ample of a siklos-type metric where the z-dependence is
non-trivial. the simplest example is the higher dimen-
sional generalization [18] of kaigorodovs spacetime [19],
for which h is

h(z) = zd1.

the kaigorodov metric is

ds2 =

a2
z2 ((1  zd1)dt2  2zd1dtdx1
+(1 + zd1)(dx1)2 + dz2 + dx
2).

(4.4)

this is the adsd analogue of the simplest vacuum pp-
wave, namely, the homogeneous pp-wave in at space. it
has d1 obvious translational killing vectors, and is also
invariant under the r+-action:

(z, u, v)  (z, 

3d

2 u, 

d+1

2 v).

this action, combined with translations in u and v, gen-
erates a three-dimensional group of bianchi type v ih,
where h = 1
(d1)2 . therefore, the kaigorodov isometry
group contains a simply transitive subgroup which takes
every point with z positive to any other point with z pos-
itive. a similar d-dimensional simply transitive group ex-
ists in the adsd case, for which the r+ action is simply
z  z. in the adsd case, we can extend beyond the
reach of the group, in the kaigorodov case we cannot.

clearly, freely falling timelike observers (who can cross
the surface z =  after a nite period of ane parame-
ter time [15]) will see innite tidal forces in this region.
this shows that there are naked curvature singularities at
the points z = . given our discussion in the previous
section, where we saw that generic z-dependent graviton
perturbations will diverge at large z, it is clear that we
should regard these singularities as a generic feature of
siklos spacetimes.

v. discussion

we have shown that it is possible to include a non-
linear gravitational wave on a thick domain wall back-
ground, in such a way that one may recover the randall-
sundrum bound state. given the formal witten style sta-
bility proofs in [5], which work as long as one has a solu-
tion of the rst order equations, one might have thought
that this would ensure that the randall-sundrum sce-
nario could be perturbed in this way without problems.
however somewhat to our surprise, we have found that
generically gravitons propagating in the bulk become sin-
gular on what is a cauchy horizon in the unperturbed
spacetime. these singularities are somewhat unusual, in

that scalar invariants formed from the curvature tensor
do not blow up but rather the components of the cur-
vature in a parallelly propagated frame along a timelike
geodesic do blow up. such singularities are called pp
curvature singularities [15].

one might worry that these singularities signal a
breakdown in our ability to make unitary predictions.
however, any statements about unitarity should be re-
stricted to physics on the brane at z = constant. any
pathological eects which may emerge from the singular-
ity will be heavily red-shifted by the time they reach the
brane. consequently, the extent to which these singulari-
ties signal a pathology of the theory is at present unclear.
interestingly, if one considers massless z-independent pp-
waves (these would correspond to the randall-sundrum
zero mode bound state), one nds that the components
of the curvature do not blow up, and presumably the
spacetime has a non-singular extension.

to conclude we would like to return to the question
of whether a suitable super-potential exists which can be
derived from a supergravity model. the results of [5] and
[7] show that for the simplest case of a single scalar eld
in models of the type studied in [13] they do not. in fact
one may show quite generally that for the models in [13]
with an arbitrary number scalar elds they do not. the
same is true for the models considered in [8]. it therefore
remains an important open problem to nd a suitable
supergravity model or prove that no such model exists.
