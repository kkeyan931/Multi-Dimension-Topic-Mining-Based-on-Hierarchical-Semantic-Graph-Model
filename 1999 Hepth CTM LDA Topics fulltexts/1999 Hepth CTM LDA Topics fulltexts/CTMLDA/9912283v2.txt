abstract

we show that quantum eects can stabilize a soliton in a model with no
soliton at the classical level. the model has a scalar eld chirally coupled to
a fermion in 1+1 dimensions. we use a formalism that allows us to calculate
the exact one loop fermion contribution to the eective energy for a spatially
varying scalar background. this energy includes the contribution from coun-
terterms xed in the perturbative sector of the theory. the resulting energy is
therefore nite and unambiguous. a variational search then yields a fermion
number one conguration whose energy is below that of a single free fermion.

i. introduction

scalar eld theories can contain spatially varying (but time independent) congurations
that are local minima of the classical energy. these solitons are found as solutions to the
nonlinear classical equations of motion. sometimes a topological conservation law can be
used to show that the soliton is absolutely stable because it is the lowest energy conguration
with a given value of a conserved topological charge. when quantum eects are taken into
account, the classical description must be reexamined. now the spatially varying soliton
conguration should minimize the eective energy which takes into account classical and
quantum eects1. since the eective energy for general congurations is dicult to compute,
quantum eects are typically computed as approximate corrections to the classical soliton.
in a nonrenormalizable theory, these corrections are cuto dependent and the model must

reserved for spatially constant congurations.

be redened to include the cuto prescription. the hope is that the energy of the soliton is
slightly altered by quantum eects but its qualitative features remain.

in this letter we give an example of a quantum soliton that is not present in the classical
theory alone. we examine a renormalizable model in 1 + 1 dimensions where a scalar eld
is yukawa coupled to a fermion. fermion number is conserved. the classical energy is
minimized when the scalar eld has a constant value v. there are no classical solitons.
the fermion gets a mass m = gv through the yukawa coupling. we calculate exactly the
fermions properly renormalized one loop contribution to the scalar eld eective energy.
by exactly we mean to all orders in the derivative expansion, which is crucial since we
consider congurations varying on the scale 1/m. we then show that for certain choices
of model parameters  in particular with g large  we can exhibit a eld conguration
that carries fermion number and has energy below m. it cannot decay by emitting a free
fermion. we search for the lowest energy conguration carrying fermion number using a few
parameter variational ansatz. the soliton, which is the actual lowest energy conguration
with fermion number one, is presumably not far from our variational minimum and has
strictly lower energy. the soliton therefore has energy less than m and is absolutely stable.
the idea that a heavy fermion can create as soliton is not new and has been explored
previously [1,2]. what we are adding to the discussion is the ability to exactly calculate the
renormalized fermionic one loop eective energy for any spatially varying meson background,
which is essential for demonstrating stability at the quantum level. since we are working in a
renormalizable theory, the counterterms in the lagrangian cancel the cuto dependent part
of the sum over zeropoint energies in the explicit evaluation of the eective energy, leaving
a nite result. this result is unambiguous because we are able to x the counterterms in
the perturbative sector of the theory. furthermore, we can choose model parameters to
justify neglecting the one loop boson contributions and all higher loop contributions. thus
we conclude that in this 1 + 1 dimensional model, a heavy fermion can create a soliton.

ii. the model

the model we consider has a twocomponent meson eld ~ = (1, 2) coupled equally
to nf fermions. we suppress the fermion avor label but will keep track of the factor nf
as necessary. the lagrangian is l = lb + lf with

lb =

(the reason for the commutators in eq. (3) will be explained later.) note that with  set

navely, one would imagine that spontaneous symmetry breaking occurs with  = 0. then
we could pick a classical vacuum, say ~cl = (v, 0), and expand the theory about this point.
but in 1 + 1 dimensions, the massless mode that corresponds to motion along the chiral
circle, ~  ~ = v2, gives rise to infrared singularities and there is no spontaneous symmetry
breaking [3]. by introducing  6= 0 we have tilted the potential to eliminate the massless
mode. for  large enough it is legitimate to expand about ~cl. there are two massive
bosons, which we call  and , with m2
 = v2. the classical bosonic
theory governed by lb has no classical soliton.
the fermions get mass through their yukawa coupling to ~. in the perturbative vacuum,
expanding about ~cl, the fermion has mass m = gv. one could imagine that various
distortions of ~ would aect the fermion spectrum. for example, one could keep 2 = 0 and
let 1  1(x) with limx 1(x) = v, but 1(x) < v over some region in x of order w.
alternatively, one could keep ~  ~ = v2, but let ~ = v(cos (x), sin (x)), where (x)  0 as
x   and (x)  2 as x  +. again the deviation of ~ from ~cl occurs in a region
of order w. in both cases, if w is of order 1/m, then there are bound state solutions of the
singleparticle dirac equation associated with eq. (3) that have binding energies of order m,
so that a fermion bound to the ~ eld has an energy below m. (because of its topological
properties, the latter conguration is especially ecient at binding a fermion [4].) however,
there is an energy cost from the gradient and potential terms. still, considering just the
single bound fermion and the classical scalar energy, we might expect a total energy below
m for g large enough.

of course,  describes a quantum eld and any distortion of the background ~(x) away
from ~cl will cause shifts in the zeropoint energies of the fermion uctuations. to form a
selfconsistent approximation, we must compute the eect of these shifts as well, since they
are of the same order in  as the bound state contribution. in general the sum over zeropoint
energies diverges. in order to proceed we must regularize and renormalize the calculation.
we are working in a renormalizable eld theory so we know that the counterterms that
are implicit in lb will cancel these divergences. we want to compare the energy of non
trivial congurations with the perturbative spectrum of the model, therefore we x the
counterterms by standard renormalization conditions on the greens functions. the greens
functions are evaluated perturbatively so the counterterms have an expansion in feynman
diagrams.

regularization and renormalization of the sum over zeropoint energies has been prob-
lematic in the past. we work in the continuum, where the sum is replaced by an integral
over scattering phase shifts. in ref. [4] we show that it is possible to analytically continue
this integral to d spatial dimensions, where it converges. then we are able to identify po-
tential divergences with low orders in the born expansion for the phase shifts, and, in turn,
with specic feynman diagrams. we subtract the low order born terms from the integral,
which then remains nite when analytically continued back to d = 1. we then add back in
the corresponding feynman diagrams, which combine with the counterterms in the usual
way to yield a nite and unambiguous result in d = 1. in the next section we show how we
evaluate this contribution to the energy of a static conguration.

iii. the one fermion loop effective energy

we have written eq. (3) as a commutator to ensure that the lagrangian is invariant
under the charge conjugation operation   c and (1, 2)  (1,2). as a result,
the vacuum energy gets contributions from both the positive and negative energy eigenvalues
of the single particle dirac hamiltonian

h[~ ] = i1

d
dx

+ g (21 + 32) .

(5)

here we are using a majorana representation of the dirac matrices, 0 = 2, 1 = i3, and
5 = 1, which implies that c = 1. for one avor of fermions the energy of the lowest
energy state is

evac =

1

2( xn>0

n + xn<0

n) = 

1

2xn

|n| ,

(6)

where the s are the eigenvalues of h[~ ]. (for a charge conjugation invariant background,
for each eigenvalue  there is an eigenvalue , so the two sums in eq. (6) are the same, and
evac reduces to the sum over the dirac sea, evac =pn<0 n.) we will restrict our attention
to background elds that obey 1(x) = 1(x) and 2(x) = 2(x). in this case, h[~ ]
commutes with the parity operator p = 2, where  is the coordinate reection operator
that transforms x to x. we can thus decompose the solutions of eq. (6) into separate
parity channels.
for a given background, we wish to evaluate eq. (6) and subtract from it what we get in
the free case, ~ = (v, 0). following ref. [5], we use the relationship between the change in
the density of states and the derivative of the phase shift

(k)  0(k) =
to write the change in the vacuum energy as

here (k) = k2 + m2,  is the scattering phase shift for the positive (negative) parity
channel, the {l} are the discrete bound state energy levels, and ect is the counterterm
contribution, which is xed by renormalization conditions discussed below. the extra m/2
reects an important subtlety in one dimension:
in the noninteracting case (f (k) = 0)
there are bound states exactly at the continuum thresholds,  = m, which count as 1/2
in the sum in eq. (6) [6]. levinsons theorem,

(m) + (m) = (n

) ,

relates the phase shift at threshold to the number of bound states n, with threshold bound
states again counting as 1/2. it allows us to rewrite eq. (8) as

ef =

(|l|  m) z

((k)  m)

d

f (k) + ect ,

(11)

which is convenient because it makes it clear that as we increase the background and a
bound state appears, there are no discontinuities in ef .

of course, ef given by eq. (11) is formally innite. for large k, the phase shifts go
to zero like 1/k so the integral is divergent. to regulate this divergence and allow us to
identify it unambiguously with specic feynman diagrams, we have extended the method
of dimensional regularization to the density of states written in terms of phase shifts. the
details are presented in ref. [4]. once continued to d-dimensions, where all quantities are
nite, we can identify the leading large k behavior of f (k) with the contribution of the
rst born approximation plus the piece of the second born approximation related to it by
chiral symmetry, which we call (k). we also identify it unambiguously with the coecient
of the lagrangian counterterm, v2  ~  ~, evaluated by standard feynman perturbation
theory. the renormalization conditions that x the counterterm in perturbation theory here
translate into the statement that in evaluating eq. (11) we should subtract (k) from f (k).
after this subtraction the integral can be analytically continued back to d = 1 to give a
result that is nite and unambiguous,

(12)

(13)

we can solve numerically for the phase shift f (k) for any background ~(x). we make
use of the fact that p commutes with h[~ ] so that positive and negative parity channels
are decoupled. the positive (negative) parity states obey

and therefore

(x) = 2(x)

i(cid:19) .

(14)

(15)

any state dened for x  0 and obeying one of the boundary conditions in eq. (15) can be
extended via eq. (14) to the whole line, so we need only consider the half line x  0 with the
boundary conditions eq. (15). consider the free case, ~ = (v, 0). for each energy , both
positive and negative, the right moving eigenstate of eq. (5) is

(17)

where k = 2  m2 is positive. for backgrounds ~(x) that are not everywhere equal to
~cl, we still impose the requirement that ~(x) approaches ~cl as x gets large. for these
nontrivial backgrounds we call k(x) the eigenstate of eq. (5) that approaches 0
k(x) as
x   and k(x) the eigenstate that approaches 0

k(x) as x  . note that 0

be the parity eigenstates of h[~ ] with energy . this denes the phase shifts (). the
2 ambiguity in this denition is resolved by requiring that the phase shifts be smooth and
go to zero as   . note that in the free case () = 0. for any value of , we can
solve numerically for the eigenstates of eq. (5) in both parity channels. using eq. (18) we
can then extract the phase shifts. our method for computing the phase shift actually allows
us to resolve the 2 ambiguity for each  individually and has other numerical advantages,
which are elaborated in ref. [5].

for any value of k we can obtain f (k), so we can compute the integral in eq. (12). to nd
the bound state energies we solve the eigenvalue problem numerically. levinsons theorem
tells us how many bound states to search for. for a xed background ~, the numerical
evaluation of eq. (12) can be done quickly and with high accuracy. this allows us to search
over a class of ~s for the conguration with the lowest total energy.

iv. the total energy

we are interested in calculating the total one loop eective energy of a static conguration
~(x). we take ~(x) to be specied by a short list of parameters {i}. we measure energy
in units of the fermion mass m = gv and use a dimensionless distance  = mx. in 1 + 1
dimensions ~(x) and v are dimensionless. we rescale ~(x) by v so that ~(x)  (1, 0) as
||  , and dene dimensionless couplings

g2

and

 =


g2 .

by this rescaling, using eq. (1) and eq. (2), we have

where prime denotes dierentiation with respect to .

the fermion one loop contribution to the energy arises from eq. (5), which with ~ mea-

sured in units of v is

(21)

we see that a single fermion makes a contribution proportional to m and dependent on the
variational parameters {i}. this means that eq. (12) can be expressed as me f ({i}). for
nf avors the one loop contribution is therefore nf me f ({i}).
the boson one loop contribution comes from summing the square roots of the eigenvalues
of the operator   2
. rescaling as before we nd that the boson one loop energy can
be written as me b({i}). putting together the classical energy and the one loop energies
we get

nf e b( , ,{i}) + higher loops .

(22)

for nf large we can neglect the boson one loop contribution relative to the fermion one
loop contribution. furthermore it can be shown that 1/v2 counts boson loops. taking both
nf and v2 large with the ratio xed, we can neglect the higher loops entirely and all but
the single fermion loop in eq. (22). therefore we need only consider the contributions from
ecl and e f .

v. the fermion number

a nontrivial background ~(x) distorts the energy levels of the dirac hamiltonian eq. (5),
possibly introducing single particle bound states (with positive and negative energy). we
identify the lowest energy state of the system, the one with the all the negative energy levels
lled, as the vacuum. if a level crosses zero as we locally interpolate between ~cl(x) and
~(x), this state will have nonzero fermion number. in particular, if ~(x) circles ~ = (0, 0)
as ~ goes from (1, 0) at x =  to (1, 0) at x = , then the vacuum state will carry
nonzero fermion number provided that the scale over which ~ varies, w, is much larger
than the fermion compton wavelength 1/m [7,2]. in ref. [8] we derive a formula for the
fermion number of the vacuum, qvac, in terms of the positive energy phase shifts at k = 0
and the number of positive energy bound states,

qvac = nf (cid:18) 1



[+(m) + (m)] +

1

2  n>0(cid:19)

(23)

where n>0 is the number of bound states with positive energy. the congurations we look
at loop at most once around ~ = 0, so qvac is either 0 or nf . we are interested in states
with fermion number nf . if qvac = nf , then the state we want is the vacuum. if qvac = 0,
then we build the lowest energy state with fermion number nf by lling the lowest positive
energy level of eq. (5) with nf fermions. therefore, if qvac = 0, e f appearing in eq. (22)
must be augmented by 1 where m1 is the smallest positive eigenvalue of eq. (21).

vi. results

we want to look for background congurations ~ that can produce states with fermion
number nf , and whose total energy is below nf m. from eq. (22) with e b neglected, we
dene

b =

which is the energy of the fermionic conguration minus the energy of nf free fermions in
units of mnf . for our numerical computations, we take the ansatz

1 + i2 = 1  r + r ei where  = (1 + tanh(/w)) .

(25)
the two variational parameters are r and w. as  goes from  to , ~ moves in a circle
of radius r in the (1, 2) plane, starting and ending at (1, 0). the scale over which ~
varies is w.

for xed  and  we vary r and w until we produce the conguration with the smallest
b. the results are shown in fig. 1. we see that it is possible to nd a conguration whose
total energy is below nf m. since we are minimizing b subject to the constraint that  is
of the form eq. (25), we know that the true minimum of b in the fermion number nf sector
also has an energy below nf m. this is the stable soliton.
in fig. 2 we show the width, wsol, and the radius, rsol, for the minimum energy congu-
ration as a function of  for various values of . note that the size of the soliton grows like
1/  as  goes to zero. in that region, rsol approaches 1, so the ~ conguration approaches
the chiral circle. in fact, the energy of the fermion number nf soliton goes to zero as  goes
to zero. however for  very small the bosonic quantum uctuations restore the classically

that this large and light soliton is a reliable consequence of this model. for moderate values
of , where the width of the soliton is not controlled by 1/ , we do trust our results.
for the value of v/nf shown in fig. 2, the model becomes trustworthy for   0.3. for

further discussion of this point, see ref. [4].

we have developed and applied a variational technique for renormalizable quantum eld
theories through one loop order. because we have applied unambiguous, standard perturba-
tive renormalization procedures, we have been able to hold the theory (i.e. the renormalized
masses and coupling constants) xed, while searching over a variational ansatz. here we
have used these methods to demonstrate the existence of a stable fermionic soliton, stabilized
by quantum eects, in a model with no soliton at the classical level. the result suggests
that similar phenomena might persist in 3+1 dimensions, and no obstacles stand in the way
of generalizing the method to that case.
