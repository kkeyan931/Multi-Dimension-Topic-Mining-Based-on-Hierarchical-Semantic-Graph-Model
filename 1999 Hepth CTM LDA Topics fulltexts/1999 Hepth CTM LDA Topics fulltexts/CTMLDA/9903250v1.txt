abstract. this paper is concerned with the formulation of a non-
pertubative theory of the bosonic string. we introduce a formal
group g which we propose as the universal moduli space for
such a formulation. this is motivated because g establishes a
natural link between representations of the virasoro algebra and
the moduli space of curves.

remarkable paper, mumford ([mu]) proved the existence of canonical
isomorphisms:

n  z

which have been studied in depth from dierent approaches.

for instance, within the frame of string theory, these isomorphisms
are one of the main tools in the explicit computation of the polyakov
measure for bosonic strings in genus g ([bk, mm]). proposals for
developing a genus-independent (or non-pertubative) formulation of
the theory of bosonic strings have been made by several authors (e.g.
[br, mo, bns]).

in this paper we propose a universal moduli space as the main
ingrident for a non-perturbative string theory which is dierent from
those introduced by the above authors.

following the spirit of previous papers ([amp, mp]), where a formal
geometry of curves and jacobians was developed (see [bf, p] for other
applications of these ideas), we introduce a formal group scheme g
representing the functor of automorphisms of k((t)) (see  3); more
precisely, the points of g with values in a k-scheme s are:

g(s) = auth 0(s,os)alg h 0(s, os)((t))

the formal group scheme g might be interpreted as a formal mod-
uli scheme for parametrized formal curves. the canonical action of g
on the innite grassmannian gr(k((t))dtn) allow us to construct an
invertible sheaf, n, on g (for every n  z) endowed with a bitorsor
structure. using a generalization of the lie theory for certain non com-
mutative groups (given in appendix b), we prove that these sheaves
satisfy an analogous formula of the mumford theorem; that is, there
exist canonical isomorphisms (see theorem 4.7):

to show that our formula is a local version of mumfords, rather than
a mere coincidence, we relate g and the moduli of curves by means
of innite grassmannians (see subsection 4.d for precise statements).
let m
g be the moduli space of pointed curves of genus g with a given
parameter at the point (see denition 4.9). then, the action of g on
gr(k((t))) induces an action, , on m
g . moreover, given a rational
point x  m

g , the action induces a morphism of schemes:

g x m

let bx be the composite of the immersion of bg (the formal completion

of g at the identity) into g, x, and the projection m

finally, the last section oers a proposal on how to apply these results
to a non-perturbative formulation of the bosonic string. the explicit
development of these ideas and the geometric interpretation of partition
functions in terms of the geometry of the group g will be performed
elsewhere.

2. background on grassmannians

2.a. the grassmannian gr(k((t))). this section summarizes re-
sults on innite grassmannians as given in [amp] in order to set no-
tations and to recall the facts we will need.

below, v will always denote the k-vector space k((t)) and v + the
subspace k[[t]]. let bf be the set of subspaces generated by {ts0, ts1, . . . }
for every strictly increasing sequence of integers s0 < s1 < . . . such that
si+1 = si + 1 for i >> 0. let b denote the set of subspaces of v given
by the t-adic completion of the elements of bf . we can now interpret
b as a basis of a topology on v . it is easy to characterize the neigh-
borhoods of 0 as the set of subspaces a of v such that there exists an
integer n >> 0 with tnk[[t]]  a and it is of nite codimension.

now the pair (v, b) satises the following properties:
 the topology is separated and v is complete,
 for every a, b  b, it holds that (a + b)/(a  b) is nite dimen-

sional,

 if a, b  b, then a + b, a  b  b,
 v /a = lim

(b + a/a) for every a  b.

bb

and hence there exists a k-scheme, called the grassmannian of (v, b)
and denoted by gr(v ), whose s-valued points is the set:

quasi-coherent sub-os-modules l  vs such that for every point s  s,
lk(s)  vk(s) and there exists an open neighborhood u of s and a  b

such that vu /lu + au = (0) and lu  au is free of nite type

(k(s) is the residual eld of s) where lt := lim(l/l  as) os ot for
a submodule l of vs and a morphism of k-schemes t  s.
the very construction of gr(v ) shows that {fa | a  b} is an
open covering by ane subschemes where fa is the k-scheme whose





4

j. m. mu noz and f. j. plaza

s-valued points are:

nlocally free sub-os-modules l  vs such that ls  as  vso

from this fact one deduces (see [amp]) that the complexes of ogr(v )-
modules l agr(v )  vgr(v ) are perfect (l being the universal object
of gr(v )) for every a  b. moreover, the euler-poincar`e characteris-
tic of the complex l  agr(v )  vgr(v ):

l 7 dim(l  v +)  dim(v /l + v +)

gives the decomposition of gr(v ) into connected components. the
connected component of characteristic 0 will be denoted by gr(v ). it
is easy to show that these complexes are all quasi-isomorphic.

from the theory of [km] on determinants, it follows that their de-
terminants are well dened and that they are isomorphic. the choice
of v +  b now enables us to construct a line bundle on the grass-
mannian as follows: on the connected component of characteristic n
consider the determinant of det(l  tn v +
grn(v )  vgrn(v )). the result-
ing bundle will be called the determinant bundle and will be denoted
simply by detv .

it is also known that given a complex l agr(v )

a vgr(v ) (a  b),
the morphism a gives a section of det(l  agr(v )  vgr(v )). by
xing the basis {tn|n  z} of v one checks that the induced isomor-
phisms among determinants of these complexes are compatible (see
[amp]). using such isomorphisms the above-dened section gives a
section a of det
v . the section dened on the connected component
of characteristic n by the determinant of the addition homomorphism
l  tn v +

grn(v )  vgrn(v ) will be denoted by +.

2.b. the linear group gl(v ). for each k-scheme s, let us denote
by autos ( vs) the group of automorphisms of the os-module vs.

denition 2.1.

 a sub-os-module l  vs is said to be a b-neighborhood if there
exists a vector subspace a  b such that as  l and l/ as is
locally free of nite type.

 an automorphism g  autos ( vs) is called b-bicontinuous if g( as)

and g1( as) are b-neighborhoods for all a  b.

 the linear group, gl(v ), of (v, b) is the contravariant functor

over the category of k-schemes dened by:

s   gl(v )(s) := {g  autos ( vs) such that g is b-bicontinuous }

5

theorem 2.2. there exists a natural action, , of gl(v ) on the grass-
mannian, preserving the determinant bundle.

proof. the rst part is easy to show.
it suces to prove that g(l)
belongs to gr(v )(s) for an s-valued point l  gr(v )(s) and an
arbitrary g  gl(v )(s) using that g is b-bicontinuous.

note that given g  gl(v )(s) and an s-scheme, t , one has an
induced isomorphism vs/ as  vs/g( as) for each a  b. twist-
ing by ot , and taking inverse limit over a  b, one obtains an
ot -automorphism gt of vt , which due to the very construction is b-
bicontinuous. moreover, the map:

gl(v )(s)  gl(v )(t )

g 7 gt

is functorial. so, for an element g  gl(v )(s) we have constructed gt 
gl(v )(t ) for every s-scheme t ; hence, g yields an s-automorphism
of gr(v )s := gr(v ) k s. we have then constructed a functor
homomorphism:

gl(v )  aut(gr(v ))

g 7 g

where aut(gr(v ))(s) := auts-sch(gr(v )s).

p

with the expression preserving the determinant bundle we mean
that g
2n (where pi denotes the projection onto the
i-th factor of gr(v ) k s) for a line bundle n over s. it is therefore
enough to prove the statement when s is a local ane scheme.

theorem 2.3. there exists a canonical central extension of functors
of groups over the category of k-schemes:

0  gm  fgl(v )  gl(v )  0

6

j. m. mu noz and f. j. plaza

and a natural action, , of fgl(v ) over the vector bundle, v(detv ),

dened by the determinant bundle lifting the action .

proof. for an ane k-scheme s, dene g(s) as the set of commutative
diagrams (in the category of s-schemes):

v(det

v )s

 v(det

v )s

g

gr(v )s

g

 gr(v )s

y

y

where g is an isomorphism and g  gl(v )(s) and the homomorphism
g  gl(v ) by g 7 g. for an arbitrary scheme s dene g(s) by
sheacation; that is, consider a covering {ui} by open ane subschemes
of s and g(s) the kernel of the restriction homomorphisms:

we have then obtained an extension:

g(ui) 

 yi,j

g(ui  uj)

gm  g  gl(v )  0

yi
0 yz

since h 0(gr(v )s, ogr(v )s ) =qz h 0(s, os) ([amp]).
finally, dene fgl(v )(s) as the direct image of this extension by the
morphism qz gm  gm which maps {ai} to a0. observe that for any

projection {ai} 7 an the resulting extensions are isomorphic.

let us compute the cocycle associated with this central extension.
for the sake of clarity we shall begin with the nite dimensional sit-
uation: v nite dimensional, {v1, . . . , vd} a basis, b consists of all -
nite dimensional subspaces and v + :=< vn+1, . . . , vd > (for an integer
0  n  d). then, gr(v ) parametrizes the n-dimensional subspaces of
v . let g denote the morphism < v1, . . . , vn > v g v  v /v + for
an element g  gl(v ) (observe that g consists of the rst n columns
and rows of the matrix associated with g).

we now have the following exact sequence:

0  gm  fgl(v )

p
 gl(v )  aut(nv )  0

let us consider the subgroup gl+(v ) consisting of those automor-
phisms g  gl(v ) such that g is an isomorphism. it is easy to check
that:

g 7 (cid:16)g, det(g)(cid:17)

7

is a section of p over gl+(v ). the cocycle associated to the central
extension is given by:

c(g1, g2) = det(cid:16)g1  (g1  g2)1  g2(cid:17)

the cocyle corresponding to the lie algebra level follows from a
i -valued point

straightforward computation. let id +idi be a k[i]/2
of gl(v ) (i = 1, 2). the very denition of the cocycle:

clie(d1, d2)12 = c(id +1d1, id +2d2)  c(id +2d2, id +1d1)

yields the expression:

clie(d1, d2) = tr(d+

(2.4)
where d+
: v +  v  :=< v1, . . . , vn > is induced by id +idi 
gl(v ) with respect to the decomposition v  v   v + (and, analo-
gously, d+

: v   v +).

the case of (v = k((t)), b, v + = k[[t]]) and v  = t1k[t1] is very

similar and the same formulae remain valid.

3. the automorphism group of k((t)): g

this section aims at studying the functor (on groups) over the cat-

egory of k-schemes dened by:

s   g(s) := auth 0(s, os )-alg h 0(s, os)((t))

where the group law in g is given by the composition of automorphisms
(here r((t)) stands for r[[t]][t1] for a commutative ring r with iden-
tity; or, what amounts to the same, the laurent developments in t with
coecients in r).

3.a. elements of g. let us consider the following functor over the
category of k-schemes:

s   k((t))(s) :=ninvertibles of h 0(s, os)((t))o

the rst result is quite easy to show:

lemma 3.1. the functor homomorphism:

r : autr-alg r((t))  k((t))(r)

g

7 g(t)

induces an injection of g into the connected component of t, k((t))
.
1
moreover, g(r)  k((t))
(r) is a semigroup homomorphism with re-
1
spect to the following composition law on k((t))
1

:

m : k((t))
1

(r)  k((t))

(r)  k((t))
1
(g(t), h(t)) 7 h(g(t))

(r)

(3.2)

y

8

j. m. mu noz and f. j. plaza

theorem 3.3. the morphism r induces a natural isomorphism of
functors:

g  k((t))
1

proof. the only delicate part of the proof is the surjectivity of r. the
idea is to relate g(r) with the group of automorphisms of r[[x]][y].

let i be the ideal of r[[x]][y] generated by (x  y  1), and let

auti r[[x]][y] be the group:

{g  autr-alg r[[x]][y] such that g(i) = i}

since there is an isomorphism r[[x]][y]/i  r((t)) (which maps x to
t and y to t1), one has a morphism auti r[[x]][y]  autr-alg r((t)),
and a commutative diagram:

auti r[[x]][y]

r r[[x]][y]

 r[[x]][y]/i

autr-alg r((t))

r r((t))

1  r((t))

where r(f ) := f (x).

observe that the induced morphism:

 ( series f (x, y)  x  r[[x]]  rad(r)[y]

such that the coecient of x is invertible)!  r((t))

1

is surjective. the claim being equivalent to the surjectivity of r, it is
then enough to show that:

( series f (x, y)  x  r[[x]]  rad(r)[y]
such that the coecient of x is invertible )  im( r)

given an element x  f (x) + n(y)  x  r[[x]]  rad(r)[y] where f (0)

is invertible, consider the following r-endomorphism:

 : r[[x]][y]  r[[x]][y]

x 7 x  f (x) + n(y)

y 7

y

f (x)

 1 +

y  n(y)

f (x) !1

(which is well dened since f (x)  r[[x]] and n(y) is nilpotent).

provided that  is an isomorphism, it holds that (i) = i and that
r() = x  f (x) + n(y). to show that  is actually an r-isomorphism

9

of r[[x]][y], observe that  = 3  2  1 where 1, 2, 3 are r-
isomorphisms of r[[x]][y] dened by:

(2(x) = x  f (x)

2(y) = y

3(x) = x
3(y) = y

f (x) (cid:16)1 + yn(y)

f (x) (cid:17)1 (1(x) = x + (3  2)1(n(y))

1(y) = y



3.b. formal scheme structure of g. set an k-scheme s and an
element f  k((t))(s). from [amp] we know that the function:

s  z
s 7 vs(f ) := order of fs  k(s)((t))

is locally constant and that the connected component of t, k((t))
, is
1
identied with the set of s-valued points of a formal k-scheme, k((t))
1.
one therefore obtains an isomorphism between the functor g and the
functor of points of the formal scheme k((t))
1:

g(s)  k((t))

ar, . . . , a1  rad(r), a0  r and r < 0 )
1(s) =( series (artr +    + a0 + a1t + . . . )t such that

(where r = h 0(s, os)).

3.c. subgroups of g. two important subgroups of g  k((t))
the subschemes g+ and g dened by:

1 are

g+(s) := (t  (1 +xi>0

ai ti) where ai  r)

and:

respectively.

scheme g (g, gm and g+) at the point {id}.

polynomials t  (ar tr +    + a1 t1 + 1) such

g(s) := 
that ai  r are nilpotent and r arbitrary 
let bg (respectively bg, bgm and bg+) be the completion of the formal
lemma 3.4. the subgroups bg, bgm and bg+ commute with each other
proof. recall that hom(spec(a), bg) is the union of hom(o/mn
1. bg(a), bgm(a) and bg+(a) commute with each other,
2. bg(a)  bgm(a)  bg+(a) = bg(a),

o, a)
where o is the ring of g and mo is the maximal ideal corresponding
to the identity. it therefore suces to show that:

bg  bgm  bg+ = bg

10

j. m. mu noz and f. j. plaza

for each local and rational k-algebra a such that mn+1

a = 0 for n >> 0.
let us proceed by induction on n. the case n = 1 is a simple

computation.

consider the following subgroup of g(a):

1. let us prove that bg(a) and bgm(a) commute with each other.
h(a) := nantn + . . . + a0 with ai  ma for i < 0 and a0  ao

and note that we have the group exact sequence:

0  ch(k[mn

a])  ch(a)  ch(b)  0

where b = a/mn
a.

h1
  h  h1

for an element h  ch(a) there exist h  bg(b) and h0 
bgm(b) such that (h) = (h  h0); or what amounts to the same:
a]) = bg(k[mn
the induction hypothesis implies that ch(k[mn
bgm(k[mn
bgm(k[mn

a]) and hence there exist h
a]) such that:
h1
  h  h1

  bg(k[mn

0  ch(k[mn

a]) and h

a]) 
0 

0 = h

  h
0

a])

and therefore:

ch = bg  bgm

the proofs of the other commutation relations are similar.

analogously, one proves that ch = bgm  bg.
2. note that g0  g = g  g0 for g0  bgm(a) and g  bg(k[mn

and proceed similarly.

a])

theorem 3.5. the functor g is canonically a subgroup of gl(v ).

proof. note that it suces to show that g(s), gm(s) and g+(s) are
canonically subgroups of gl(v )(s) for each k-scheme s, since:

 bg = bg  bgm  bg+,
 bg = g and bg+  g+,
 g = bg  g+.

by the very denition of gl(v ), it is enough to prove the case when

s is a local ane scheme, spec(r).

the cases of gm and g+ are straightforward since:

(tnr[[t]]) = tnr[[t]]

n

for   gm(s) or   g+(s).

let us now consider   g(s). let u(t) be such that 1(t) =

11

t(1 + u(t)). it then holds that:

1(tr) = tr(1 + u(t))r = tr 

since u(t) is nilpotent, there exists s such that:
1(trr[[t]])  tsr[[t]]

rxi=0 r

i!u(t)i

in other words:

trr[[t]]  (tsr[[t]])

the nakayama lemma implies that the family {(ts), . . . , (tr1)}
generates (tsr[[t]])/trr[[t]]. using the fact that   g one proves
that they are linearly independent; summing up, (tsr[[t]])/trr[[t]] is
free of nite type.

3.d. the lie algebra of g, lie(g).

theorem 3.6. there is a natural isomorphism of lie algebras:

lie(g)  k((t))t

compatible with their natural actions on the tangent space to the grass-
mannian, t gr(v ). (from now on derk k((t)) will denote k((t))t)

proof. take an element g(t) = t(1 + g0(t))  lie(g) (recall that by
denition lie(g) = g(k[]/2) g(k) {id}). let us compute (g)(tm)
for m  z:

(g)(tm) = g(t)m = tm(1 + g0(t))m =

= tm(1 + mg0(t)) = (id +   g0(t)tt)(tm)

it is now natural to dene the following map:

lie(g)  derk k((t))

t(1 + g0(t)) 7 g0(t)t  t

and this turns out to be an isomorphism of k-vector spaces.

in order to check that this map is actually an isomorphism of lie
algebras, let us compute explicitly the lie algebra structure of lie(g).
given two elements gn(t) = t(1+1tn) and gm(t) = t(1+2tm) (where

2
i = 0), we have:

gn(gm(t)) = gm(gn(t))(1 + (m  n)12tm+n)

that is:

[gm, gn] = (m  n)gm+n

since [tm+1t, tn+1t] = (m  n)  tm+n+1t, one concludes that the map
is in fact an isomorphism of lie algebras.

12

j. m. mu noz and f. j. plaza

let us check that the actions of these lie algebras on t gr(v ) co-
incide. fix a rational point u  gr(v ) and take an element g(t) =
t(1 + g0(t))  lie(g). clearly, the image of (g, u) by  lies on:

tu gr(v ) = gr(v )(k[]/2) 

gr(v )(k)

{u}  homk(u, v /u)

which is associated with the morphism:

u  v

tg0(t)
 v  v /u

consider an element d  derk k((t)). then the image of (d, u) under
the action of derk k((t)) on t gr(v ) is:

u  v d v  v /u

and the conclusion follows.

let vir denote the virasoro algebra; that is, the lie algebra with a

basis {{dm|m  z}, c} and lie brackets given by:

[dm, c] = 0

[dm, dn] = (m  n)dm+n + n,m

(m3  m)

12

c

by abuse of notation vir and virasoro will also denote the lie alge-
bra given by lim
vir /{dm|m > n}. both algebras have a universal
central extension:

n

ext1(k((t))t, c) = c  vir

and this is the important feature for our approach (see [kr] lecture 1,
[ackp] 2.1, [lw]).

will be called the virasoro group.

virasoro algebra, vir.

denition 3.7. the central extension of g given by theorem 2.3, eg,
proposition 3.8. the lie algebra of eg, lie(eg), is isomorphic to the
remark 1. let us compute the cocycle associated with lie(eg). let
g(fv +) = fv +. since bg is contained in gl+(v ), one can use the
formula 2.4. recall that a basis of lie(bg) is given by the set {gn(t) :=
t(1 + tn)|n  z} since lie(bg) = bg(k[]/2).

gl+(v ) be the subgroup of gl(v ) consisting of elements g such that

the element of gl+(v ) (a z  z matrix) corresponding to gm is:

13

if i = j
if i = j + m
otherwise

1
  j
0

(gm)ij =
n1xj=0

and the cocycle is therefore:

c(gm, gn) = n,m 

j(j  n) = n,m

3.e. central extensions of g. we begin with an explicit construc-
tion of an important family of central extensions of g.

fix two integer numbers ,  and consider the k-vector space v, :=

tk((t))(dt). the natural isomorphism:

d, : v  v,

f (t) 7 tf (t)(dt)

allows us to dene a triplet (v,, b, := d,(b), v +
one has therefore an isomorphism:

, := d,(v +)).

gr(v )  gr(v,)

observe that the action of g on v, dened by:

(cid:0)g(t), tf (t)(dt)(cid:1) 7 g(t)f (g(t))(dg(t)) = t(cid:0) g(t)

t (cid:1)f (g(t))g(t)(dt)

induces an action on gr(v,) (by a straightforward generalization of
theorem 3.5), and also in gr(v ):

, : g  gr(v )  gr(v )

note that 0,0 is the action of g on gr(v ) dened in the previous

section. moreover, these actions are related by:

,(g(t)) =  (cid:16) g(t)
t (cid:17)

 g(t)!  0,0(g(t))

where the rst factor is the homothety dened by itself.

the theorem 2.3 implies that there exists a central extension:

0  gm  eg,  g  0

14

j. m. mu noz and f. j. plaza

corresponding to the action ,. moreover, it follows from its proof

that eg, consists of commutative diagrams:
y

v(det

gr(v )

y

, (g)
 gr(v )

g

v )

 v(det

v )

or equivalently:

eg, = {(g, g) where g  g and g : ,(g) detv

since ,(g) detv  detv for all g  g. it is not dicult to show

 detv }

that the extensions eg, and eg, are isomorphic for every ,   z.
then, eg0, (respectively 0,) will be denoted by eg (). the group
law of eg is:

(h, h)  (g, g) = (h  g, g  (g)(h))

since we have:

(h  g) detv = ((g)  (h)) detv

 (g)(h)

 (g) detv

g

 detv

these central extensions induce extensions of the lie algebra lie(g)

whose corresponding cocycles are:

c(m, n) = n,m 

(j + (m + 1))(j  n + (n + 1))

n1xj=0

= n,m (cid:16)m3  m

6

(cid:17)(1  6 + 62)

(3.9)

to obtain such a formula, one only has to check that the matrix corre-
sponding to (gm) is:

((gm))ij =

1
  (j + (m + 1))
0

if i = j
if i = j + m
otherwise

remark 2. it is worth pointing out that one can continue with this geo-
metric point of view for studying the representations of lie(g) since
it acts on the space of global sections of the determinant line bun-
dle which contains the standard fock space. (for an explicit con-
struction of sections of det
v , see [amp]). an algebraic study of the
representations of vir induced by , has been done in [kr].

3.f. line bundles on g. formula 3.9 may be stated in terms of line
bundles. for this goal, let us rst recall from [sga] the relationships
among line bundles, bitorsors and extensions.

recall that a central extension of the group g by gm:

15

0  gm  e  g  0

(e being a group) determines a bitorsor over (cid:16)(gm)g, (gm)g(cid:17), which

will be denoted by e again.

e

moreover, given two bitorsors e and e , one denes their product by
gm
 e , which is the quotient of e  e  by the action of gm:

gm (cid:16)e  e (cid:17)  e  e 

(g, (e, e)) 7 (e  g, g  e)

(where the dot denotes the actions on e and e ).

from [sga] 1.3.4 we know that the group law of e induces a canon-

ical isomorphism:

p
1e

gm
 p

2e  me

(3.10)

of (cid:16)(gm)gg, (gm)gg(cid:17)-bitorsors (where pi : g  g  g is the pro-

jection in the i-th component and m the group law of g).

conversely, a bitorsor e satisfying 3.10 and an associative type prop-
erty (see [sga] for the precise statement) determines an extension of
g.

observe that one can associate a line bundle to such an extension.

given:

consider the line bundle:

0  gm  e  g  0

l := e

gm
 a1
k

where e is interpreted as a principal ber bundle of group gm and gm
acts on a1
k by the trivial character and on e via the inclusion gm 
e. further, the structure of e implies that there exists a canonical
isomorphism:

p
1l  p

2l  ml

(3.11)

one proves that the product of bitorsors corresponds to the tensor
product of line bundles; that is, for two extensions e and e  there exists
a canonical isomorphism:

l
e

gm
 e 

 le  le 

16

j. m. mu noz and f. j. plaza

conversely, if l is a line bundle satisfying 3.11 and an associative
type property, then the principal bre bundle isom(og, l) is a principal
bre bundle of group gm which can be endowed with the structure of
central extension such that the associated line bundle is l.

denition 3.12. the invertible sheaf on g associated with eg will be

denoted by .

4. main results

4.a. modular properties of the  -function. let us x a point
x  gr(v ) and a non negative integer . from theorem 2.2 we know
that there exists l, a line bundle over g, such that:





p

2 detv  p

2 detv p

1l

(4.1)

where:

g  gr(v )

 g  gr(v )

p2 gr(v )

then, restricting to g  x and looking at sections we have:

+((g)(x)) = l(g)  +(x)

for a certain section l(g) of l (we assume here that +(x) 6= 0, so
that it generates (det

v )x).

the above identity is the cornerstone of the modular properties of
the  -functions. however, let us give a more precise statement. as-
sume that the orbit of x under  (consisting of invertible laurent
series acting by multiplication, see [amp]) is contained in fv +. note,
further, that l may be trivialized. then, with the above premises,
the following theorem holds:
theorem 4.2. there exists a function l(g) on g, such that:

 (g)(x) = l(g)  x

to nish this section let us oer a few hints on the explicit compu-
tation of l. the previous statement is to be understood as an equality
of s-valued functions (for a xed k-scheme s and g  g(s)).

however, in order to describe this isomorphism explicitly it suces
to deal with the case of the universal automorphism, g, corresponding
to the identity point of g(g). note that the following relation holds:

(g) = g  1(g)

(where g acts as a homothety) and observe that the proof of theorem
2.2 implies that the existence of canonical isomorphisms:

(g)

remark 3. the above theorem can be interpreted as the formal ver-
sion of theorems 5.10 and 5.11 of [knty].

4.b. central extensions of g and lie(g). along the rest of this
section it will be assumed that k = c. nevertheless, some results
remain valid for char(k) = 0. (we refer the reader to appendix b for
notations and the main results on lie theory for formal group schemes).

theorem 4.4. the functor lie induces an injective group homomor-
phism:

ext1(g, gm)  ext1(lie(g), bga)

proof. here ext1(g, gm) denotes the group of equivalence classes of

denotes the group of equivalence classes of central extensions of lie
algebras.

central extensions of g by gm as formal groups, and ext1(lie(g), bga)
given an extension of g, eg, the restriction of the group functors
gm, eg and g to the category ca (bgm, beg and bg respectively) gives rise
to a class in ext1(bg, bgm). observe that this map is injective. recalling
that lie(g) = lie(bg), bga  bgm and theorem b.5, one concludes.

4.c. some canonical isomorphisms.

theorem 4.5.

l  

proof. observe that equation 4.1 implies that:

and hence l is the line bundle associated with the central extension
g.

theorem 4.6. there are canonical isomorphisms:

theorem 4.7 (local mumford formula). there exist canonical isomor-
phisms of invertible sheaves:

proof. this is a consequence of theorem 4.4 and formula 3.9.

remark 4. this theorem is a local version of mumfords formula. the
next subsection will throw some light on the relation between this for-
mula and the original global one.
it is worth pointing out that the
calculations performed in subsection 4.a throw light on the explicit
expression of the above isomorphism. this can be done with proce-
dures similar to those of [bm].

corollary 4.8. let h be the subgroup of g consisting of seriespi0 aizi

where a0 is nilpotent and a1 = 1.

there is a canonical isomorphism:

(see [se] 6 for explicit formulae).

4.d. orbits of g: relation with the moduli space of curves.
recall from [mp] the denition (which follows the ideas of [knty,
ue]):

denition 4.9. set a k-scheme s. dene the functor fm

category of k-schemes by:

g over the

s   fm

where these families satisfy:

g (s) = { families (c, d, z) over s }

1.  : c  s is a proper at morphism, whose geometric bres are

integral curves of arithmetic genus g,

2.  : s  c is a section of , such that when considered as a
cartier divisor d over c it is smooth, of relative degree 1, and
at over s. (we understand that d  c is smooth over s, i for
every closed point x  d there exists an open neighborhood u of
x in c such that the morphism u  s is smooth).

3.  is an isomorphism of os-algebras:

 os((z))

bc,d

19

on the set fm

g (s) one can dene an equivalence relation, : (c, d, z)
and (c , d, z) are said to be equivalent, if there exists an isomorphism
c  c  (over s) such that the rst family goes to the second under
the induced morphisms. let us dene the moduli functor of pointed
curves of genus g, m
g (s)/. we know
from theorem 6.5 of [mp] that it is representable by a k-scheme m
g .
the following theorems are now standard results:

g , as the sheacation of fm

theorem 4.10. let g,  be two non-negative integer numbers. the
krichever morphism:

k : m

g  gr(k((t))(dt))
(c, p, z) 7 h 0(c  p, 
c )

is injective in a (formal) neighborhood of every geometric point. the
image will be denoted by m

g,.

theorem 4.11. the action  of g on gr(v ) induces an action m

g,.

proof. recall that g(r) = autralg r((t)) and that the points of
m
g (r) are certain sub-r-algebras of r((t)) (r being a commuta-
tive ring with identity). we thus have that the krichever morphism is
equivariant with respect to the canonical action of g on m
g and 0 on
gr(v ). this implies the  = 0 case. the claim is now a straightforward
generalization.

in order to study the deformations of a given datum, more denitions
are needed. first, let m
g dened by the same
conditions as in denition 4.9 except that the third one is replaced by:
 z is a formal trivialization of c along d; that is, a family of

g be the subscheme of m

epimorphisms of rings:

oc   (os[t]/tm os[t])

m  n

compatible with respect to the canonical projections os[t]/tm os[t] 
os[t]/tm os[t] (for m  m), and such that that corresponding
to m = 1 equals .

analogously, we introduce the moduli space of pointed curves with an
n-order trivialization, mn
g (n  1), as the k-scheme representing the
sheacation of the following functor over the category of k-schemes:

s   { families (c, d, z) over s }/ 

where these families satisfy the same conditions except for the third
which is replaced by:

20

j. m. mu noz and f. j. plaza

 z is a n-order trivialization of c along d; that is, an isomorphism:

oc/oc(nd)   (os[t]/tnos[t])

the canonical projections m

serve that the natural projections mm

we have:

similarly, dene d

corresponding deformation functors are representable by the comple-
tion of the local rings.

lemma 4.12. let x  m
then, the following sequence:

g(k) be a triplet (c, p, z) with c smooth.

0  h 0(c  p, tc)  k((t))t  lim

n

h 1(c, tc(np))  0

(where tc is the tangent sheaf on c) is exact.

proof. let m, n be two positive integers. let us consider the exact
sequence:

0  oc(np)  oc(mp)  oc(mp)/oc(np)  0

since z is a formal trivialization and p is smooth, it induces an isomor-
phism oc(mp)/oc(np)  tmk[[t]]/tnk[[t]]. twisting the sequence
with tc and taking cohomology one obtains:

0  h 0(tc(np))  h 0(tc(mp))  tmk[[t]]t/tnk[[t]]t 

 h 1(tc(np))  h 1(tc(mp))  0

since op oc

observe that given x there exists an element g  bg such that the

transform of x under g, x g, belongs to m

g. then, the proof is equiv-

g  im 

from lemma 4.12, it follows that the action of bg(k[]/2) = k((t))t =

lie(g) on k((t)) and that of der(h 0(c  p, oc)) = h 0(c  p, tc) on
h 0(c p, oc) are compatible; further, the isotropy of x under k((t))t
is precisely h 0(c p, tc). one can now check that the above sequence
induces a map:

whose image is naturally identied with tx gm

g via the

kodaira-spencer isomorphism. and the theorem follows.

remark 5. let us now compare theorem 4.7 and the standard mum-
ford formula. let mg denote the moduli space of genus g curves,
g : cg  mg the universal curve, and  the relative dualizing sheaf.
let us consider the family of invertible sheaves:

 := det(rg,)

  z

let p : m

g  mg be the canonical projection. then, it holds that:

k 

 detv

 p

furthermore, choose a rational point x  m

g and let p be the

composite:

then, it holds that there exist isomorphisms:

the compatibility of these isomorphisms with those of the mumford
, should follow from the proof theorem 4.7

and the computations of [bm, bs].

5. application to a non-perturbative approach to bosonic

strings

two standard approaches to conformal field theories are based
on moduli spaces of riemann surfaces (with additional structure) and
on the representation theory of the virasoro algebra, respectively. it is
thus natural to attempt to unify both interpretations (e.g. [knty]).
in our setting, subsections 3.d and 4.d unveil the important role
of the group g in both approaches. motivated by this fact and by
the suggestions of [br] and [mo], we propose g as a universal moduli
space which will allow formulation of a non-perturbative string theory.
let us remark that in the formal geometric setting developed in [mp],
the group g is the moduli space of formal curves.

let us sketch how this construction should be carried out, although

details and proofs will be given in a forthcoming paper.

let us consider the vector space vd = cd c c((t)). the natural
representation, 1, of g on v1 induces a representation of g on vd, given
by 1  d. . .1. following the procedure given in  3, it is easily proved
that this representation yields an action, d, of g on the grassmannian
gr(vd) preserving the determinant bundle. the corresponding central
extension determines a line bundle ld on g with a bitorsor structure.
in order to clarify the physical meaning of this higher dimensional
picture, it is worth pointing out that the fock space corresponding
to string theory in the space-time r2d1,1 is naturally interpreted as
a subspace of h 0(gr(vd), det), the space of global sections of the
dual of the determinant bundle. moreover, the actions of the virasoro
algebra on the fock space and that of lie(g) on h 0(gr(vd), det) are
compatible.

the calculations in section 5 of [br] can now be restated in the fol-
lowing form: there exists a canonical isomorphism of invertible sheaves:

ld

 d
1

this isomorphism, together with the local mumford formula (theo-
rem 4.7), implies that ld and 2 are isomorphic if and only if d = 13
(complex dimension).

observe that the group scheme eg carries a ltration {gn|n  0},

where:

gn(r) := {  eg(r)|(t) = xim

the restriction homomorphisms:

aiti with m  n}

n : h 0(g, )  h 0(gn, |gn)
j

23

associated with the inclusions jn : gn  g give:

j : h 0(g, )  lim

n

h 0(gn, |gn)

let x be a rational point of m

g . the action of g on x induces:

n
g : gn  m

g

which takes values in the deformation functor of x, dx. moreover,
gn  dx happens to be surjective for all n  3g  3 (see theorem
4.13). denote by fg  h 0(g3g3, 2|g3g3) the inverse image by 3g3
of the section of 2 corresponding to the partition function of genus g.
then, there exists a global section f  h 0(g, 2) such that j(f ) is
precisely {fg}.

g

the relationship between hermitian forms on the canonical sheaf of
a complex manifold and holomorphic measures on them is well known.
the generalization of this relation to innite-dimensional manifolds
would allow us to give a genus-independent polyakov measure on g
constructed in terms of the above introduced f .

appendix a. deformation theory

let us recall some notations and give some results on deformation

theory as exposed in [sc].

let ca be the category of local rational artin k-algebras. an ad-
missible linearly topologized k-algebra o (see [ega] 7) canonically
denes a functor from ca to the category of sets:

a   ho(a) := homcont(o, a)

(where a is endowed with the discrete topology). observe that ho(a) =
homk-alg(o, a) for a discrete k-algebra o.

the condition that ho consists of only one point is equivalent to

saying that o is local and rational.

the denition below is that given in [sc] 2.2, which generalizes the

concept of formal smoothness of [ma].

denition a.1. a functor homomorphism f  g is smooth i the
morphism:

is surjective for every surjection b  a in ca.

f (b)  f (a) g(a) g(b)

remark 6. the following remarks merit attention:

 if f  g is smooth, then f (a)  g(a) is surjective for all a in

ca ([sc] 2.4),

 ho  ho is smooth i o is a series power ring over o ([sc] 2.5),

24

j. m. mu noz and f. j. plaza

 ho is said to be smooth i the canonical morphism ho  hk is

smooth.

the tangent space to a functor over ca, f , is dened by:

recall lemma 2.10 of [sc]: if it holds that:

tf := f (k[]/2)

f (k[v  w ])  f (k[v ])  f (k[w ])

for arbitrary vector spaces v, w (where k[v ] is the ring k  v with
v 2 = 0), then f (k[v ]) (and in particular tf ) has a canonical vector
space structure such that f (k[v ])  tf  v . observe that the functor
ho satises the above condition for all o.

lemma a.2. let  : f := hof  g := hog and f  hk be two
morphisms of functors over ca such that:

 f  hk is smooth,
 the sets f (k) and g(k) consist of one element,
 tf := f (k[]/2)  tg := g(k[]/2) is surjective,

then f  g is smooth (and hence surjective).

proof. first, we claim that f (k[v ])  g(k[v ]) is surjective for every
k-vector space v (k[v ] denotes the ring k  v in which v 2 = 0). since
f (k[v  w ])  f (k[v ])  f (k[w ]) and g(k[v  w ])  g(k[v ]) 
g(k[w ]) for vector spaces v, w , lemma 2.10 of [sc] holds, and hence
there are canonical vector space structures on f (k[v ]) and g(k[v ])
such that they are isomorphic to tf  v and tg  v (in a functorial
way) respectively. since tf  tg is surjective by hypothesis, the claim
follows.

let a be an object of ca and i  a an ideal such that i 2 = 0. then,

one has a commutative diagramm:

f (a)

a g(a)

f (a/i)

i g(a/i)

fy

gy

where we can assume by induction over dimk a that i is surjective
(since tf  tg is surjective).

let (f, g) be an element of f (a/i)  g(a) such that i(f ) = g(g).
since f  hk is smooth and o is local it follows that f is a surjection.
let f  f (a) be a preimage of f . then the images of a( f ) and g
under g coincide; both of them are i(f ). note that 1
g (i(f )) is an

ane space modeled over derk(og, i); or what amounts to the same:

g  n( f)  derk(og, i)

observe that the bottom arrow of the following commutative dia-

gramm:

25

derk(of , i)  derk(og, i)

y

y

f (k[i])  g(k[i])

is surjective. let d  f (k[i]) be a preimage of g  n( f ).

it is now easy to verify that f + d is a preimage of (f, g) under the

induced morphism:

f (a)  f (a/i)  g(a)

and the statement follows.

appendix b. lie theory

this appendix aims at generalizing some results of lie theory for
the case of (innite) formal groups. to this end, we recall some more
results of [sc] and proceed with ideas quite close to those of [ha] 14.

denition b.1. a functor f from ca to the category of groups will be
called a group functor. if, moreover, there exists a k-algebra o and an
isomorphism f  ho, then f will be called a formal group functor.

let cgr and cfor gr denote the categories of group functors and formal
group functors over ca, respectively. let c0
for gr denote the full subcate-
gory of cfor gr consisting of those f such that f (k) has only one element
and f is smooth.

remark 7.

 let f be a formal group functor over ca. then, the tangent

space at the neutrum:

lie(f ) := f (k[]/2) f (k) {1}

(which coincides with tf ) is a lie algebra where the lie bracket
is induced by the product of f .

 finally, for a formal group functor and a morphism a  a/i

with i 2 = 0 one has the following exact sequence of groups:

0  f (k[i])  f (a)  f (a/i)  0

26

j. m. mu noz and f. j. plaza

lemma b.2. let char(k) = 0. let f and g be two formal group
functors. assume that f is smooth and that f (k) = {e} (one point).
then, the canonical map:

homgr(f, g)  homvect. sp.(tf , tg)

is injective.

proof. let a be an object of ca and m  a its maximal ideal and n
such that mn+1 = 0. let ,  be in homgr(f, g) such that the induced
vector space homomorphisms ,  from tf to tg coincide. one has
to prove that  = .

let us rst deal with the case n = 1. by lemma 2.10 of [sc], there
exist functorial isomorphisms f (a)  tf  m and g(a)  tg  m (m
as a k-vector space). it is now clear that both,  and , give the same
morphism f (a)  g(a).

now assume n  2. using the nakayama lemma one obtains a

surjection:

ar,n := k[x1, . . . , xr]/(xn+1

1

, . . . , xn+1

r

)  a

and hence a commutative diagramm:

f (ar,n)  f (a)

g(ar,n)  g(a)

y

y

and similarly for . observe that the top row is surjective since f is
smooth and ar,n  a is surjective. therefore, it suces to prove the
statement for ar,n.

note that the injection ar,n  arn,1 (char(k) = 0):

k[{xi | 1  i  r}]/(xn+1

i
xi

)  k[{xij | 1  i  r, 1  j  n}]/(x2

ij)

7 xi1 + . . . + xin

induces two commutative diagramms (for  and ):

0  f (ar,n)  f (arn,1)

0  g(ar,n)  g(arn,1)

y

y

it is then enough to check the case of ar,1. let us proceed by induction
on r. the case r = 1 follows directly from the hypotheses.

we claim that the the following diagramm is commutative:

27

0  f (k[ker(p)])  f (ar,1)

pf f (ar1,1)  0

ry

r1y

py

0  g(k[ker(p)])  g(ar,1)

pg g(ar1,1)  0

(and analogously for ). the morphisms pf and pg are surjective
since they have sections, because the natural inclusion ar1,1  ar,1
is a section of the projection:

p : ar,1  ar1,1

xr 7 0

bearing in mind that (ker p)2 = 0, the claim follows.

the rst case, which we have already proved (the square of the max-
imal ideal is (0)), implies that the p = p. the inductions hypothesis
implies that r1 = r1.

now, recalling that both sequences split, one concludes that r = r

as desired.

let us now relate the study of group functors with that of lie alge-
bras. let clie denotes the category of lie k-algebras. then, there is a
functor:

lie : cfor gr  clie

for a lie k-algebra l dene a functor on ca:

f 7 lie(f ) = tf

a   l(a) := l k ma

(the lie bracket of l(a) is that of l extended by a-linearity).

let ch(x, y) denote the campbell-hausdor series (see, for instance,

[ha] 14.4.15):

ch(x, y) = x + y +

1
2

[x, y] +

1
12

[x, [x, y]] +

1
12

[y, [y, x]] + . . .

(b.3)

then the map:

l(a)  l(a)  l(a)

(x, y) 7 ch(x, y)

(note that ch(x, y) is a nite sum since a is artinian) endows l(a)
with a group structure ([ha] 14.4.13-16). let us denote this group
functor by lg. moreover lg  hk is smooth and lg(k) consists of one
point. finally, since ch(x, y) only depends on additions of iterated
lie brackets one has that every morphism of lie algebras l1  l2

28

j. m. mu noz and f. j. plaza

induces a morphism of group functors lg
is a functor:

1  lg

2. in other words, there

g : clie  cgr
l 7 lg

such that lie g = id.

example 1. it is now easy to prove that nite dimensional lie algebras
are the lie algebras of formal groups. indeed, let l be the dual vector
space of a given lie algebra l. then, it holds that:

homcont(o, a) = l k ma

where o := bs l is the completion of the symmetric algebra, s l,

with respect to the maximal ideal generated by l.

it is now straightforward to see that lg = ho and that:

lie(ho) = (mo/m2

o) = l

lemma b.4. let f be an object of c0
(which will be called exponential) dened by:

for gr. the functor homomorphism

f  f
t

d 7 exp(d) :=xi0

yields an isomorphism tg

f  f .

1
i!

di

proof. note that the sum is nite since d  t

a  ca) is of the type d = pj mjdj (where mj  ma and dj  tf )

and hence di has coecients in mj
a. by the above construction, the
exponential is a group homomorphism since it holds that ([ha] 14.14):

f (a) = tf  ma (for

exp(d)  exp(d) = exp(ch(d, d))

in the same way that the exponential map has been dened a loga-

rithm can also be introduced. now the conclusion follows trivially.

from all these results one has the main theorem of this appendix
which is a version for (certain) non-commutative group functors of the
standard lie third theorem.

theorem b.5. the functor lie renders c0
clie.

for gr a full subcategory of

proof. this follows from the following two facts:

 if f, g  cgr have isomorphic lie algebras tf  tg, then they are
f  f

isomorphic. (recall that there are group isomorphisms tg
and tg

g  g).

 homcgr (f, g)  homclie(tf , tg) (lemma b.2 proves the injectiv-

ity and the equality lie g = id the surjectivity).
