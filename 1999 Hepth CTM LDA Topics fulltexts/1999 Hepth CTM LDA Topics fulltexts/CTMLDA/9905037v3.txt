if the ads/cft correspondence is valid in the coulomb branch, the potential between

waves on a pair of test branes in the bulk should be reproduced by the relevant yang-mills

theory eective action on the boundary. earlier work has provided evidence for this in

the case of constant gauge eld brane waves. in this paper we provide concrete evidence

for an earlier proposal that the eects of exchange of supergravity modes with nonzero

momentum in the brane directions are encoded in certain terms involving derivatives of

the eld strength in the gauge theory eective action. we explicitly calculate the force

quadratic in the eld strengths coming from the exchange of non-zero momentum two form
elds between two 3-branes in ads5  s5 to lowest nontrivial order in the momentum.
we show that this is exactly the same as that between the branes living in at space.

the result is in agreement with the gauge theory eective action and consistent with

the non-renormalization property of this term. we comment on the relationship of other

acceleration terms in the sym eective action with quantities in supergravity.

1. introduction.

the duality between type iib superstring theory on ads5  s5 and n = 4 super-
symmetric yang-mills theory in 3 + 1 dimensions [1] [2] is most commonly studied at the

conformally invariant point. recently there has been some evidence that the duality is
valid in the coulomb branch 3 as well [3] [4] [5]. a simple setting for this is to study
the force between waves on a pair of test 3-branes in the bulk of ads5  s5 [3]. on the
supergravity side this force is due to exchange of massless supergravity modes propagat-
ing in ads5  s5, while on the yang-mills side this is read o from an eective action
obtained by intergrating out uctuations around the relevant expectation values of the

scalars (representing the positions of the test branes) and other elds (representing the

waves on the branes). consider for simplicity brane waves made of gauge elds alone. let
ya denote coordinates along the brane directions and zi denote the coordinates transverse
to the branes. a pair of branes located at positions zi
2 is represented in the u (n )
yang-mills theory by the constant expectation value of the higgs eld i

in the above expressions we have normalized the elds so that the kinetic term in the
gauge theory action does not contain any power of gy m . in (1.4) the subscript |4 means
the term with four factors of the gauge eld.

note that the one loop result is identical for su (2) and su (n ) since the particles

which run around the loop must be charged under both the u (1)s in which z1, z2, f1, f2 lie.
for su (2) this one loop result is known to be exact [6]. for su (n ) this is also exact at a

generic point on the coulomb branch when one includes a sum over the various u (1) factors
[7]. for our situation, in which su (n )  su (n  2)  [u (1)]2 these nonrenormalization
theorems are still expected to be valid [3]. this means that the result (1.4) is valid at

strong coupling where a comparison with supergravity can be made.

for su (2) the various terms in (1.4) have a straightforward supergravity interpretation

in terms of exchange of supergravity modes with zero momentum in the brane directions.

note that  is related to the transverse distance z between the branes by

z = l2

however 1/(z)4 is the static coulomb propagator in the at six dimensional transverse

where the supergravity elds have been normalized such that there is no power of  in

their kinetic terms. using the above formulae it may be checked that the gauge theory
answer for the o(f 4) terms is exactly of the same form as the supergravity answer. this

is similar to the way velocity dependent forces between branes are reproduced from the

relevant gauge theory and has played an important role in m(atrix) theory [8] in particular,

the factors of gy m and  in the former give the correct factors of  and z in the latter.

for su (n ) and in the scaling limit of [1], the result is due to exchange of supergravity
modes propagating in ads5  s5, but we expect that the nal answer is the same as that
in at space ! in [3] it was shown that the zero (brane) momentum propagators for the
dilaton, rr scalar and the longitudinal graviton 4 in ads5  s5 are the same as those
in at space. their couplings to the brane elds are also identical in ads5  s5 and at
space, which is related to the fact that they couple to dimension four operators. this
explains why the rst three terms in (1.4) come from supergravity exchange in ads5  s5.
in contrast, the propagators of the 2-form elds in ads5  s5 are quite dierent from
those in at space [4], even at zero momentum. in particular the n s  n s and r  r
2-forms mix with each other in the ads5  s5 background via the ve form background
eld.

let us use the standard form of the ads5  s5 metric

(1.11)

we will use the following conventions. the ten dimensional coordinates will be denoted by
y,  = 0,    9. out of these we denote the brane worldvolume directions by ya, a = 0,    3.
the remaining six transverse coordinates y5    y9 will be relabelled as zi, i = 1,    6.
r = qp6
i=1(zi)2 is the radial coordinate in the transverse space and i are angles on
(r, i) are related to the cartesian coordinates zi in the transverse space by

the s5.

4 these are all minimally coupled scalars in the transverse space

3

the standard transformations and the metric coecients fi(i) are determined from these
transformations.

we combine the two 2-form elds into a complex eld b

b = bnsns



+ ibrr


then the propagator with zero momentum along ya is given by [4]

ab,cd(z1, z2) = z d4y < b 
g(0)

ab(y, z1)bcd(y, z2) >

=

(1.12)

(1.13)

(1.14)

note that the propagator depends on the individual brane locations. in at space one has

g(0)

ab,cd(z1, z2) =

1

43|z1  z2|4 [acbd  adbc]

(1.15)

in a similar way, the couplings of these modes to the brane elds are also dierent
in ads5  s5 [9] - this is related to the fact that these couple to dimension six operators.
the operator ( oab
i )f lat is now modied to

this also depends on the individual brane locations.

nevertheless it was shown in [4] that the nal result for the interaction potential

between the branes with constant gauge elds on them is identical to that in at space

and hence reproduced precisely by the yang-mills eective action. this happens due to

cancellations which are not quite understood.
in fact, even in at space, the operator
oab which couples to the 2-form eld contains a term linear in the eld strength and one

might expect a term which is quadratic in fab. from the gauge theory point of view such
a term is not present - a reection of the nonrenormalization of the coupling constant.

in the supergravity calculation this again comes about due to a cancellation between the
ns-ns and r-r exchanges and this persists in ads5  s5. these results provide rather
non-trivial evidence for validity of the ads/cft correspondence in the coulomb branch.

4

when the waves on the branes are not constant, supergravity modes which are ex-

changed will carry nonzero momentum in the brane directions and the result will be sensi-

tive to causal propagation in the bulk. however two branes situated at the same point in
s5 and separated along the radial direction in ads5 correspond to the same location in
the boundary gauge theory and one might wonder how the boundary theory knows about

causal propagation in the bulk.

in [4] it was proposed that some of these eects are encoded in certain terms in the

yang-mills eective action which involve derivatives of the gauge elds. we will refer to

such terms as acceleration terms since similar terms with the gauge elds replaced by

the higgs eld represent accelerations of the probe branes in the transverse space. in this

context such terms were studied in [10]. the simplest such term involving only gauge

elds in fact comes from the exchange of the 2-form eld. for waves on branes situated

in at space which are dependent only on time (and not the other brane coordinates) it
was shown in [4] that supergravity predicts a term proportional to (f )2 in the eective

action. this comes from the expansion of the (brane) momentum space propagator of

the 2-form eld around the static propagator. such a term is indeed present in the same
multiplet as the f 4 term [11] [12] and is also one-loop exact, which makes a comparison

with supergravity meaningful.

while these results are indicative, they do not establish the proposal even for this term.

first, with the brane waves dependent on time alone, the detailed lorentz structure of the

term is invisible while the gauge theory predicts a specic lorentz structure. secondly the

above calculation was performed in at space - i.e. with no other brane present - where

the relevant gauge theory is su (2). the nonrenormalization of this specic one loop term
in the gauge theory predicts that the same answer should follow in ads5  s5 and it is
not clear whether the cancellations which made the f 4 terms work are operative in this

context.

in this paper we provide further evidence in favor of this proposal. we perform an
explicit calculation of the (f )2 term in the supergravity potential between branes in
ads5  s5. we show, again due to remarkable cancellations, that the result is the same as
that between branes in at space and in exact agreement with the predictions of yang-mills
theory. this particular term vanishes when the gauge elds are on-shell (i.e. f 
i = 0),
but is present in an o-shell n = 2 supersymmetric eective action [12]. as we shall see,

the supergravity calculation requires that the total current which couples to the 2-form
eld is divergenceless. this means that this particular (f )2 term cancels with terms

5

higher order in f which come from other terms in the divergenceless current. thus in

sym eective action there must be cancellations between terms with dierent powers of

the gauge elds ! we then examine other possible derivative terms (which generally survive

on-shell) in the yang-mills eective action and comment whether these terms should follow

from supergravity.

2. the strategy

consider the contribution to the force between the two probe 3-branes coming from

the exchange of a single supergravity mode. symbolically the interaction action is given

by

ef f = z d4yz d4y 
ssugra

[j i(y, z1)ij (y  y , z1, z2)j j (y , z2) + (z1  z2)]

(2.1)

here j i (y, z1) denotes the current coupling to the supergravity mode labelled by i on
the brane located at z1 and similarly for j j (y , z2). ij (y  y , z1, z2) denotes the
(retarded) propagator matrix of the supergravity modes between the points (y, z1) on the

rst brane and (y , z2) on the second brane. in writing down (2.1) we have used translation
invariance along the brane directions ya. with only gauge elds excited, these currents
are some expressions made out of these gauge elds. we want to see whether ssugra

is

ef f

reproducible in a gauge theory calculation.

the expression ssugra

ef f

is of course an integral of a bi-local quantity, whereas the gauge

theory eective action is a sum of local terms arranged usually as a derivative expansion.

to make a connection between the two it is easiest to go to momentum space on the brane

but remain in the transverse position space. we thus write

j i(y, z) = z d4p eipyj i(p, z)
ij (y  y , z, z ) = z d4p eip(yy) ij (p, z, z )

(2.2)

then (2.1) becomes

s = z d4p (j i)(p, z1)ij (p, z1, z2)j j (p, z2) + (z1  z2)

(2.3)

6

we can now expand the propagator in powers of momentum and get an expression which

(after transforming back to position space on the brane) becomes an expansion in deriva-

tives of the currents.

s = z d4y0[j i (y0, z1)(0)

ij (z1, z2)j j (y0, z2)

+

1
2

(yaj i(y0, z1))(ybj j (y0, z2))ab

ij (z1, z2) +   ]

where

ij (z1, z2) = z d4sij (s; z1, z2)
(0)

is the zero momentum propagator and

(2.4)

(2.5)

ab
ij (z1, z2) = [

2

papb

ij (p; z1, z2)]p=0

(2.6)

the ellipses in (2.4) denote terms with higher derivatives on the currents.

for such a supergravity calculation to be reproducible in gauge theory one must be

able to calculate at strong couplings in the gauge theory. at present the only possibility

is to concentrate on terms in the eective action which are not renormalized, so that a

perturbative calculation in the gauge theory actually yield the strong coupling answers.

indeed there is such a term in the n = 2 o-shell eective action which is quadratic in the

eld strength [12]

z d4y

1
2 [(af ab)(cfcb) + (a f ab)(c fcb)]

where  is dened in (1.6) and fab = (f1)ab  (f2)ab while

fab =

1
2

abcdf cd

(2.7)

(2.8)

this term is in the same multiplet as the f 4/4 term and is also one-loop exact. as a

result this is identical for su (2) and su (n ) gauge theories. therefore it should follow
from supergravity calculation of the force between probe branes both in ads5  s5 and in
at space. in the next section we will show that this is indeed true.

7

3. acceleration term from 2-form exchange

since the only supergravity mode which couples linearly to the gauge elds on the

brane is the 2-form eld, we need to evaluate terms like (2.4) where the indices (i, j)

now refer to those of the 2-form. as already shown in [4], the term quadratic in the eld

strengths and containing no derivatives vanishes due to cancellations between the ns-ns

and rr 2-form exchanges. we are interested in the second term of (2.4).

the piece of the 2-form propagator < b 
the brane momenta, which we denote by g(1)
with the nal result

ab(p; z1)bgh(p, z2) > which is quadratic in
ab,gh(p; z1, z2), is calculated in appendix a

(3.5)

this piece of the propagator, like the zero momentum piece, depends on the individual

locations of the two branes in a rather complicated way.

the coupling of the 2-form eld to the probe three-branes may be read o from the
dbi-wz action of a single three brane in the ads5  s5 background. this coupling term
is [9]

z d4yz d6z [bab(y, z)j 

ab(y, z) + c.c.]

where, in brane momentum space

j ab(p) =[(f1)ab(p) + (

and we have dened the quantity

gab
i = (fi)ac(fi)cd(fi)db

(fi)ab(fi)cd(fi)cd

(3.6)

and the ellipses denote terms which are o(f 4) and higher. we have to solve the classical
equations of motion in the presence of this current using the above propagator. consistency
requires that aj ab = 0. it is easy to check that the equations of motion for the mixed
components of the 3-form eld eld strength are obeyed by bij = bai = 0 (as has been
assumed) and the solution for bab obtained from the above propagator, provided this
condition is satised.

since we are interested in the term which has the structure (f1)(f2), we can ignore
the gab piece in the current. then the full interaction action, upto terms with two deriva-
tives on the gauge elds is obtained by combining (3.4),(3.5),(2.4)and using the expressions

(1.13),(2.6) and (3.1)

ef f = z d4p[(f1)ab(p)  i( f1)ab(p)][g(0)
ssugra

ab,gh(z1, z2) + g(1)

ab,gh(p; z1, z2)]

(3.7)

[(f2)gh(p) + i( f2)gh(p)] + c.c.

it is easy to check that the term in (3.7) involving g(0) vanishes, as already noted in [4].
the calculation of the second term is outlined in appendix b.

remarkably, the dependence on individual brane locations neatly cancel in the nal

answer and we get

ssugra
ef f =



|z1  z2|2 z d4y[(af ab)(cfcb) + (a f ab)(c fcb)]

(3.8)

using the relationship between the gauge and yang-mills couplings and that between the

physical distance and the higgs values given in (1.7) and (1.8) the supergravity expression

is exactly the same, upto a numerical factor which we did not calculate, as the gauge

theory eective action (2.7).

the result (3.8) for branes separated in ads5  s5 is in fact identical to the at space
answer. this may be seen by simply noting that in at space we should put a1 = a2 = 2
and b1 = b2 = 0 in the above formulae, as seen from a comparison of the zero momentum
propagators (1.13) and (1.14). on the other hand there is no factor of ( r
r )8 in the term
s1 of the action. thus we again get back precisely the same nal expression (3.8). even
though we have not been careful about numerical factors, it is important to note that the
at space answer is exactly the same as the ads5  s5 answer. we have not bothered to
calculate an overall numerical factor in both.

9

4. other acceleration terms

once again remarkable cancellations conspired to yield a supergravity derivation of a

specic acceleration term of the gauge theory eective action, providing an yet non-trivial

evidence for the validity of ads/cft correspondence. there must be a simple reason

behind these cancellations, probably related to the supersymmetry of the theory. however

we have not been able to nd that yet.

do all such acceleration terms in the yang-mills eective action have a supergravity

origin ? consider for example terms with two factors of the gauge eld. at one loop, a

cursory look at the feynman diagram shows that one would have an expansion of the form

y m [f 2log() + xn=1
g2

(nf )2

2n

]

(4.1)

we know that the rst term vanishes by supersymmetry and the term with n = 1 is the one

which we found to have a supergravity interpretation. in fact it would be disastrous if the

rst term was non-zero. this is because while yang-mills theory knows about the coupling

g and the higgs value , supergravity knows only about the gravitational coupling  and

the physical transverse distance (z). these are related by the expressions (1.7) and

(1.8). thus the only term in (4.1) which can be entirely expressed in terms of supergravity

quantities is the term n = 1. when gy m ,  is traded for , z the rst term in (4.1)

would have negative powers of the string length; if nonzero this cannot have a sensible

explanation. in a similar way the terms with n > 1 will now contain positive powers of ls

and could have a stringy origin. indeed such terms would be renormalized. by the same
token, a possible two loop correction to (f )2/2 would also have a negative power of ls
: indeed this is zero since the one loop contribution to this term is exact. it appears that

the nonrenormalization theorems work precisely in a way which supports the gauge theory

- supergravity correspondence.

a term in the sym eective action with 2m factors of f and 2n derivatives at l loops

would have a form (dictated by simple dimension counting) which may be schematically

written as

g2m+2(l1)
y m

(nf m)2

f2(2m+n2)(z1, z2)

(4.2)

in (4.2) f2(2m+n2)(z1, z2) denotes a polynomial of z1 and z2 (these are dened in (1.1)) of
weight 2(2m + n  2) where we have assigned weight one to z1 and z2. note that beyond

10

one loop the answer will generally depend on z1 and z2 individually rather than just .

converting this to , ls and z1, z2 we get

m+(l1) l4(m+nl1)

s

(nf m)2

f2(2m+n2)(z1, z2)

(4.3)

thus for m + n < l + 1 we have negative powers of the string length, for m + n > l + 1 we

have positive powers of string length while the answer is expressible entirely in terms of 

and z1, z2 only for m + n = l + 1. it is tempting to speculate that the rst class of terms

(m + n < l + 1) vanish while there would be nonrenormalization theorems which ensure
that a term with given (m, n) will be exact at the (m + n  1)-th loop level. those with
m + n > l + 1 do not have an interpretation in supergravity. in [3] it was suggested that

such terms could be interpreted in terms of a stringy uncertainity principle. examples of

exact terms at one loop are the ones dealt with in [3],[4], f 4/4 and the term discussed

in this paper, (f )2/2. this also suggests that a term with say four factors of the gauge

elds and two derivatives should appear at two loops. there are known renormalization

theorems for such v6 terms as well. in at space supergravity they cannot appear at the

level of a single mode exchange. however, as we will soon see such terms can originate due
to single mode exchange in ads5  s5.

one could similarly start from the supergravity side and ask whether all the terms

which appear as a result of expansion of the momentum space propagator can appear in

the yang-mills theory. let us consider, for example, terms which appear from a single

dilaton exchange. the zero momentum piece is one of the f 4/4 terms considered above.

if the branes are placed in at space, the leading correction to this term along the lines of

this paper will be of the form

2 (f 2)2
(z)2

(4.4)

it is easy to see that this cannot be expressed in terms of yang-mills quantities.

the situation is quite dierent when the branes are placed in ads5  s5. recall that
the zero momentum propagator for the dilaton in ads5  s5 is identical to that in at
space, viz

g(0)

 (p, z1, z2) =

1

|z1  z2|4

11

(4.5)

however the nonzero momentum propagator is not the same as in at space. the free part
of the action of the dilaton eld in a ads5  s5 background reads



 + s(1)
s = s(0)
 = z d4y d6z

this leads to a contribution to the interaction action which is of the form

ssugra
 ef f =

2r4

f6(z1, z2) z d4y (ao

1 )(ao
2 )

(4.7)

(4.8)

where f6(z1, z2) is a polynomial of weight 6 (as dened below equation (4.2)) and the
operator o
i has been dened in (1.5). now, the ads scale r is related to gy m and ls by

r4 = (g2

y m n )l4
s

(4.9)

using this and the relations (1.7) and (1.8) this expression may be recast entirely in terms

of yang-mills quantities

s ef f =

g6
y m n

f6(z1, z2) z d4y (ao

1 )(ao

(4.10)

such a term could come from a two loop diagram in the yang-mills theory.
additional factor of g2

it has an
y m n compared to a one loop term (with four external legs) and
therefore has the expected behavior in the large-n expansion. it would be interesting to

see if the detailed structure of this term is obtainable from gauge theory.

we have seen an example where only branes placed in ads5  s5 and not in at space
seem to have a correspondence with yang-mills theory. this is what one expects. at one

loop it is dicult to see the dierence between su (n ) and su (2) (i.e. between branes in

12

ads5  s5 and branes in at space) because of a combination of the structure of the terms
and nonrenormalization theorems. in a similar way other acceleration terms are expected

to come from higher loop processes in gauge theory. we hope that the problems which

plagued similar comparisons in m(atrix) theory at higher loops [13] will not appear in our

case.

such acceleration terms have been a subject of discussion in the past. note that the
term (f )2 we have obtained vanishes on shell. in fact, for similar terms involving higgs
elds, this point has been discussed in detail in [10]. in spite of being zero on-shell, this
term is automatic in an o-shell and explicitly n = 2 supersymmetric eective action. in

[12] it was shown that such terms can be in fact removed by a suitable redenition of the

elds. even though our physical situation is dierent from that in [10] and [12] it will

be interesting to re-examine these issues in the light of our demonstration that at least
one such term can be obtained from a supergravity calculation and reects relativistic

propagators in the bulk.

the supergravity calculation, however, requires that the divergence of the total cur-
rent j ab dened in (3.5) is zero. extending our calculation to include the o(f 3) terms
in the current we nd that there are nonzero contributions with the lorentz structure
(cg1,ab)(cf ab
2 ) where the tensor gab has been dened in (3.6). note that similar terms
(with the derivatives contracted among themselves) cancelled out in our o(f 2) calculation
(see appendix b, equation (8.2)). furthermore the type of terms we have obtained above
now generalizes to the structures (aj  ab)(cjcb) and (aj  ab)(c jcb). by consistency
of the solution, these latter terms should vanish. thus, at the end of the day supergravity
predicts that the o(f 2) contribution we have calculated in fact cancels with o(f 4) terms.
the acceleration terms which do survive from the 2-form exchange are higher order in

eld strengths. they come from higher loop eects in the yang-mills theory and do not

vanish when the perturbative equations of motion are used. in addition there would be
acceleration terms coming from the exchange of the other massless elds like the dilaton.
this is consistent with the fact that a eld redenition removes the (f )2 term from
the eective action. however, this is a nontrivial prediction about the yang-mills theory.

this would mean that in the o shell sym eective action there would be precise relations
between terms with dierent numbers of gauge elds and two derivatives. furthermore,

the supergravity terms we are talking about can be entirely expressed in terms of sym
quantities only when we are in ads5  s5. this is because the factors of ( r
r )4 in front
of the cubic pieces of the current are necessary to get the right factors of ls required to
reexpress the coecient in terms of gy m , z1, z2. thus these relations must be present for
large-n sym, but not for su (2).

5. comments

in summary, we have provided quantitative evidence in favor of the proposal that

the eects of nonzero (brane) momentum exchange between branes are encoded in a class

of terms in the dual gauge theory eective action involving derivatives of the gauge eld

strengths. such terms should be expressible entirely in terms of gravitational quantities

and should therefore appear only at a particular order of the loop expansion. known

non-renormalization theorems seem to be consistent with this idea.

the piece of physics which is not transparent in this treatment is how gauge theory

really encodes causal properties of the bulk. since there is an integration over the coor-

dinates of each brane one eectively gets a propagator which is the sum of the retarded

and advanced propagators. furthermore we have performed an expansion in powers of the

brane momenta. it is dicult to see the causal structure in such an expansion. what we

have seen, however is that the gauge theory eective action knows that light has a nite

speed in the bulk - we havent been able to gure out whether it moves forward or backward

in time. however other recent results on bulk causality [14] seem to show that the guage

theory knows the latter as well.

7. appendix a : the propagator

the bulk action for the complex 2-form eld in a ads5  s5 background is
s = z d10y g

and the background 5-form eld is (in the same notation as above)

(7.3)

we will be interested in eld congurations in which only the longitudinal components of
b are nonzero : bai = bij = 0. then the action may be rewritten as

s = s0 + s1

(7.4)

where s0 is the part of the action which depends only on derivatives along the transverse
direction, while s1 is the part which depends on longitudinal derivatives.

s0 = z d10y g
s1 = z d10y g

s0 is the part of the action which was used in [4] to obtain the zero brane momentum
propagator given in (1.13). note that the chern-simons term which mixes the nsns
and rr 2-forms is present only in s0. using the explicit form of the metric and utilizing
translation invariance in the brane directions to perform a fourier transform into (brane)
momentum space we get for s1

s1 =

and the tensor ecdabef is dened as

ecd,ab,ef = cdaebf + adbecf + bdceaf

(7.8)
the propagators for massless modes in ads5  s5 are quite involved and several of
them have been obtained recently [15]. however, as is clear from the discussion of the last

section, in order to compute the term in the interaction potential between branes which

involves only two derivatives in the brane direction, all we need is the taylor expansion of
the momentum space propagator. in the above action, s0 does not involve any power of
the brane direction momentum while s1 involves two powers of the momenta. thus it is
sucient for us to treat s1 as a perturbation to s0. the term we are interested in is in
fact obtained by a single insertion of s0 into the zero momentum propagator (1.13).

the piece of the propagator quadratic in the brane momenta is therefore
ab,gh(p; z1, z2) = pc pd z d6z (
g(1)

using (1.13) and (7.8), (3.1) follows after a long and straightforward manipulation.

forward calculation

ef f = z d6z (

|z  z1|4

where

f =2(2a1a2 + i(b2a1 + b1a2))(papa)((f1)ab(f2)ab + ( f1)ab( f2)ab)

 8[(a1a2 + b1b2)  i(a1b2  a2b1)][(pa(f1)ab)(pc(f2)cb) + (pa( f1)ab)(pc( f2)cb)]

(8.2)
note that we have dened fab = 1
2 abcdf cd so that (f1)ab(f2)ab = ( f1)ab( f2)ab. thus the
rst line in (8.2), which is proportional to p2, vansihes. the second term has a coecient

which becomes, after using the denitions of a1, a2, b1, b2 in (3.3) and (1.14)

(a1a2 + b1b2) =

2
1r4
r8 (r8 + r4
2)

i(a1b2  a2b1) = 

2
1r4
r8 (r8  r4

(8.3)

thus the terms which depend on the individual brane locations cancel neatly and one gets

the result

ef f = z d6z (

(8.4)

(8.5)

transforming back into (brane) position space we get (3.8).

in at space a1 = a2 = 1 and b1 = b2 = 0 while the factors of ( r

r )8 are not present
in the action and in (8.1). using (8.1) and (8.2) it is easy to see that in this case too we

reproduce exactly (8.4).
