we argue that there are generic solutions to the type 0 gravity equations of motion

that are conning in the infrared and have log scaling in the ultraviolet. the background

curvature generically diverges in the ir. nevertheless, there exist solutions where higher

order string corrections appear to be exponentially suppressed in the ir with respect

to the leading type 0 gravity terms. for these solutions the tachyon ows to a xed

value. we show that the generic solutions lead to a long range linear quark potential,

magnetic screening and a discrete glueball spectrum. we also estimate some wkb glueball

mass ratios and compare them to ratios found using nite temperature models and lattice

computations.

1. introduction

one of the many interesting developments to arise out of maldacenas conjecture [1

3] concerns the study of large n qcd. while it is not known how to construct the dual

gravity theory for su (3) gauge theory with six quark avors, nor even the dual for any

pure su (n ) theory, it is hoped that the gravity duals that are known will share many of

the properties of everyday qcd. the main properties we seek are asymptotic freedom in

the ultraviolet and connement in the infrared.

in four space-time dimensions, the maldacena conjecture was originally applied to n =
4 supersymmetric yang-mills [1] and then to other theories that have less supersymmetry

but are still conformal [414]. since the -function is zero for these theories, they do not

behave like ordinary qcd.

witten has proposed supersymmetric yang-mills at nite temperature as a model

more suited for comparison to qcd [15]. a d dimensional euclidean gauge theory at nite
temperature is equivalent to a theory with d  1 noncompact directions and a euclidean
time compactied on a circle. at large distances the theory acts like a nonsupersymmetric
euclidean yang-mills theory in d  1 dimensions. hence, one expects to nd area law
behavior and a gap. the gravity dual for nite temperature super yang-mills is a nonex-

tremal black hole in ads space. using this, witten was able to argue that the bulk dilaton

wave equation has a discrete spectrum, implying a gap for the boundary theory. he also

demonstrated that there is an area law for the space-like wilson lines. it was later shown

that the nite temperature theory exhibits magnetic screening [16,17]. there has also been

a mini-industry comparing dual gravity results to lattice results [18], with some reasonable

agreement [1927].

however, in the uv the nite temperature theories eectively become supersymmetric

with one extra dimension. thus, the coupling does not run, but remains a free parameter.

related to this problem is that the qcd scale is set by the temperature instead of by

dimensional transmutation. so the glueball mass scale is roughly the temperature t ,
while the string tension, with the free parameter, is g2n t 2. in a qcd theory where the
scale is set by dimensional transmutation, one expects the glueball mass scale to be directly

related to the string scale.

we thus seek another gravity dual to better describe qcd. one such candidate is the

type 0 model proposed by klebanov and tseytlin [28]. ironically, this model was considered

a toy model when rst developed [29,30]. following an original suggestion by polyakov

[31], klebanov and tseytlin argued that one could construct the dual of an su (n ) gauge

1

theory with 6 real adjoint scalars by stacking n electric d3 branes of the type 0 model on
top of each other. the type 0 model has a closed string tachyon that lives in the bulk, but
no open string tachyon that lives on the branes. the closed string tachyon couples to the
ve form eld strength, which then drives the tachyon to a nonzero expectation value.

in [25] it was shown using the equations of motion derived in [28] that the eective

coupling between two heavy quarks has the desired logarithmic fall o in the uv

gy m

where  is the energy scale. a possible ir solution was given in [25], but after a closer
inspection, one nds that for generic tachyon potentials, the uv solution does not connect
to this particular ir solution. in [32] a dierent ir solution was given which corresponds
to an ir xed point with innite coupling and no connement. for a given class of tachyon
potentials, such a xed point could conceivably connect to the uv point in [25].

at rst glance, the presence of this ir xed point seems sensible since, as was shown
in [32], the two loop contribution to the -function is positive. hence one might expect a
banks-zaks xed point [33]. presumably, quantum corrections can push the value of this
xed point to innite coupling.

on the other hand, one could argue that quantum corrections lift the masses of the
adjoint scalars. hence this theory should behave much like pure su (n ) gauge theory, with

some extra massive states. using this reasoning, one should expect the type 0 theory to
conne.

in fact, using only some modest assumptions about the tachyon potentials, we will

show that the classical dual gravity equations of motion have generic solutions in the ir
which exhibit i) a linear quark-antiquark potential ii) magnetic screening and iii) a discrete

glueball spectrum. the glueball mass scale is related to the string scale by m  /n 1/4,

with no dependence on a free parameter. if one assumes that the tachyon reaches a xed
value in the ir, then there exists ir solutions where the curvature diverges, but where
many, if not all,  corrections fall o exponentially.

in section 2 we review the type 0 model and discuss a uv solution with a running
coupling constant. we assume here that the tachyon potentials satisfy a minimum number
of properties, but are otherwise generic. in section 3 we discuss various ir solutions. we

argue that in order to reach the ir solutions discussed previously in the literature requires
plenty of ne tuning, and even then, it is not guaranteed that the uv solution of section
2 can match to these solutions. we then discuss a generic class of ir solutions and argue

2

that the uv solution is adjustable enough to match over the range of these ir solutions.

in section 4 we examine the validity of these solutions beyond the classical limit, where in

general we nd that string corrections swamp the leading order term. however, we nd
some solutions where many  corrections are exponentially suppressed. in the ir these
solutions approach a conformal transformation of the product space r+  m4  s5, with
the tachyon owing to a constant value. this leads us to speculate that there is an exact

solution to the full -model whose asymptotic behavior matches the asymptotic behavior of

these classical solutions. in section 5 we discuss the physical implications of the generic ir

solutions in section 3. given one inequality, which is satised by the special solutions found

in section 4, we argue that two heavy quarks have a linear potential at large distances. we

further argue that there is magnetic screening and a discrete spectrum. we also calculate

some glueball mass ratios using the wkb method. the results dier somewhat from the

nite temperature results and the errors are larger due to the complexity of the equations.

for the low lying masses we can make reasonable estimates for lower bounds of mass ratios

which are consistent with lattice computations. in section 6 we present our conclusions.

2. the type 0 nonsupersymmetric model.

the type 0 model [29,30] has a closed string tachyon, no fermions and a doubled set

of r-r elds [29,30], and thus a doubled set of d branes [34]. because of this doubling of

the r-r elds, one can relax the self dual constraint on the 5-form eld strength. hence

one can have d3 branes that are electric instead of dyonic. the low energy world-volume

action for n parallel electric d3 branes is su (n ) qcd with six real adjoint scalar elds,

but no fermions. hence, there is no supersymmetry and the coupling will run. there is no

open string tachyon [34], so there is no tachyon in this qcd model.

klebanov and tseytlin argued that the massed squared of the closed string tachyon

gets a positive shift from the background 5 form ux [28]. with a background ux the
tachyon potential is not symmetric under t  t , so a large ux can drive the tachyon
expectation value to a nonzero value that is basically independent of the tachyon bare mass

term and its quartic coupling. the tachyon eld is a source for the dilaton, thus unlike
the n = 4 case, the dilaton expectation is not constant.

one then makes the following ansatz for the metric [28]

ds2 = e

(2.2)

(2.3)

that the left hand side of (2.3) is a constant follows from the equations of motion. the
fact that the constant is zero follows directly from the dilaton equations of motion and the
einstein equation. q is the total d3 brane charge which is proportional to n , t is the
tachyon eld and f (t ) is a function given by [28]

f (t ) = 1 + t +

(2.4)

this describes the tachyon coupling to the ve form ux. the bare tachyon potential is
the negative of g(t )

g(t ) =

(2.5)

where we have included the quartic piece of the potential. the coecient  of the quartic
coupling has yet to be determined unambiguously, so for the purposes of this paper, we
will treat it as a parameter. actually, the details of f (t ) and g(t ) are not that important,
except that we require that f (t ) have a minimum at some nite value of t and that g(t )
is positive at that value. we will often consider the special case where g(t ) = 0 when
f (t ) = 0.

the equations of motion derived from the action in (2.2) are

for large q, g(t ) plays a secondary role to f (t ) and so the tachyon expectation value
is determined by setting f (t ) = 0. as a rst approximation, we may assume that the

4

tachyon is a constant t = t0. if t0 = 0 then the solution reduces to the n = 4 solution.
when t is nonzero, then all elds are coupled and there is no known analytic solution.
however, we can attempt to nd approximate solutions that are valid in the uv and ir
regions.

an asymptotic solution valid in the uv was given in [25]. as a rst approximation
one can take the dilaton eld to be relatively constant, at least compared with  and .
assuming a constant , the equations for  and  can be solved exactly, at least in the
near horizon limit. in this case we nd

one can easily check that this satises the constraint equation in (2.3). if we plug this
back into the metric, we nd that the solution is still ads5  s5, but the curvatures of
the two spaces no longer match; s5 now has smaller curvature then ads5. in this case the
ricci scalar for the total space is proportional to

using the  and  solutions as inputs, we can go back and nd an approximate solution
2  = c0(log(/0)), and plugging this into the
for  in terms of . using the ansatz e
equation of motion for  in (2.6), we nd that the ansatz is a leading order solution if
2 /(g(t0)c1). 0 is an integration constant and we assume that
 = 1 and c0 = 4c5
0 >> 1 in order that the gauge theory length scale is much greater than the string scale.
setting  = u4, and using the lowest order solutions for c1 and c2 from (2.7), we learn
that the leading order behavior for the coupling is

(2.9)

one can easily check that to leading order in 1/ log u, the constraint equation is still
satised. we can also estimate the range of validity for this solution. computing the
leading order corrections to c1 and c2, one nds that

c1 =

(2.11)

our solution with constant t = t0 and f (t0) = 0 is valid so long as log(u/u0) >> 1.
while we are treating  as a parameter, we should note that it is crucial that g(t ) > 0
when f (t ) = 0. hence we assume that 0 <  < 1/2. the lower bound on  is so that the
complete tachyon potential is bounded below.

(2.12)
hence we can trust the classical dual gravity solution only if g(t0) << 1, since
log(u/u0) >> 1. however, for generic values of , g(t0)  1 when f (t0) = 0, hence
it would seem that the classical result is not particularly trustworthy. as it happens, the
situation is not completely hopeless [32]. while the curvature for (2.12) diverges in the

large u limit, the weyl tensor actually falls o as

|c| 

1

log u

.

(2.13)

this is a consequence of the conformal invariance in the large u limit, where the space-time
approaches that of ads5  s5, with divergent curvature. because of this fall o in |c|, the
3 correction is of the same order as the classical term. hence, while quantitative results
might not be exact, the classical dual gravity solutions could capture the true qualitative

behavior for this su (n ) gauge theory.

it would seem that the dual gravity calculation failed its rst test: the prediction in
(2.9) is that e has a log squared dependence instead of the linear log behavior found
in perturbative yang-mills. however, the physical coupling is determined by nding the
potential between two heavy quarks. using the wilson line computation of [35,36], one

nds that the quark potential is given by [25]

v  

128 3

( 1

4 )4g(t0)l log(l0/l)

l << l0

(2.14)

where l0 is some length that can be adjusted to be much longer than the string scale.
hence, the eective coupling between a heavy quark and its antiquark does appear with

6

16

the expected log dependence. in deriving (2.14) we have substituted r2 =
g(t0) log(u/u0)
into the quark potentials found in in [35,36]. a perturbative yang-mills computation gives
a quark potential proportional to g2n . since the perturbative yang-mills coupling behaves
like g2n  1/ log(l0/l), we nd that the dual gravity computation results in an eective
coupling with the desired log dependence. the actual coecient is related to the one loop
-function. unfortunately, it is clear that the coecient is model dependent and we dont
know enough to actually compute this using the gravity dual. even if we did, we should
not necessarily expect to get the correct answer since stringy corrections will be of order
1.

as we move away from the uv point at u = , the tachyon will begin moving away

from t0. solving the equations of motion to the next leading order we nd that [32]

(2.15)

the constant b in the  expansion is an integration constant that can be removed under a
conformal rescaling. notice that q only appears as an overall factor in front of e. we also
notice that the sign of g(t0) determines whether or not the tachyon expectation value
is driven toward or away from zero as one moves away from  = 0. there is also the
possibility that g(t0) = 0, in which case the tachyon expectation value is unchanged as
the system varies.

another interesting point concerns the ratio of the two and one loop contributions to

the -function [32]. to next to leading order the eective coupling e

(2.16)

let us compare this to perturbative yang-mills, where the coupling, up to two loop order
is,

(2.17)

and where b1 and b2 are the one and two loop contributions to the -function1. for an
su (n ) gauge theory with six adjoint scalars, the ratio is b2/2b2
1 = 3/16. hence we nd that
the sign of b2/2b2
1 coming from dual gravity is model independent, and that the minimum
value of the ratio, and the one that comes closest to the perturbative result, is 7/8 when
g(t0) = 0.

3. connecting to the infrared

while it is satisfying that a reasonable uv solution exists, it is not immediately clear

what the ir behavior is like. numerical simulation is very dicult with four coupled

nonlinear dierential equations, so while useful, it does not immediately lead one to the

answer.

to better explore the situation let us consider a greatly simplied model where
f (t0) = g(t0) = g(t0) = 0. in this case the tachyon is constant and the other three
elds decouple from each other. obviously the solution for the dilaton is  = 0 + 0.
the other equations of motion reduce to

 +

2q2
f (t0)

e2 = 0

 + 8e4 = 0.

(3.1)

the ads5  s5 solution is  = log(p2/f (t0)q and  = 1

2 log(4). however, there can be
other solutions to (3.1). consider the case where the solution asymptotically approaches
the ads5  s5 solution in the limit   0. each second order dierential equation should
have two integration constants. two of these are xed by choosing the singularity at  = 0.

these generalized solutions are given by

 = log(p2/f (t0) q) + xn=1
log(4) + xn=1

 =

1
2

an2n

bn2n,

(3.2)

where a1 and b1 are free parameters and the higher an and bn are determined by recursion
relations.

1 a more careful calculation of the eective coupling from the wilson loop shows that there

are no additional log log u terms. we use the convention that b1 is negative and b2 is positive.

8

we can also consider corrections to the ir (  ) ads5  s5 solution. in this case

the solutions have the form

 = log(p2/f (t0)q) + xn=1
log(4) + xn=1

 =

1
2

cnn

dnn,

(3.3)

where c1 and d1 are free parameters and the higher cn and dn are computed via recursion
relations. it is straightforward to show that a uv solution with generic values for a1 and
b1 does not connect to the ir solutions in (3.3) for any value of c1 and d1. to see this,
note that  and  both satisfy an invariance equation,

1
2

2 

q2

f (t0)

e2 = c1

 5 2 + 20e4 = c2.

(3.4)

a quick calculation shows that for the uv solutions, c1 = 2a1 and c2 = 10b1. however,
the ir solution has c1 = c2 = 0 for any c1 and d1. hence, unless a1 = b1 = 0, the
uv solution does not connect to this ir solution. to see what solution it does connect
to, note that if  >> 1, then the nonlinear term in the equation of motion is small,
likewise for the equation for . hence for large , the leading order behavior for  and  is
 = 1 + 0 + o(e21) and  = 2 + 0 + o(e42), with 1, 2 > 0. note that these
solutions are quite generic since they involve 4 integration constants. the constants of the
motion are c1 = 2
2. hence we see that the uv solutions connect to
the ir solutions with 1 = 2a1 and 2 = 2b1. if we include the 0 term from , then
the constraint condition in (2.3) implies

1/2 and c2 = 52

(3.5)

from the uv point of view, after xing the coupling and the singularities at  = 0, we are
left with three integration constants. the constraint reduces this to two. adjusting these
integration constants adjusts the values of i, i = 0, 1, 2, which also satisfy a constraint
relation. notice that one possible transformation is the conformal rescaling, where

()  (t)  log(t)

()  (t)

()  (t).

(3.6)

obviously, under this transformation the i rescale to i  ti, and so the i can be set
arbitrarily close to zero, the limiting result being the usual ir xed point of ads5  s5.
aside from this conformal transformation, we are left with one independent transformation
to the integration constants.

9

let us turn to the more dicult case where f (t0) = g(t0) = 0, but g(t0) 6= 0.
from the last line of (2.6) we see that t is constant, hence the problem is reduced to 3
coupled nonlinear dierential equations. as was argued in the last section [25,32], there
is a uv solution whose leading behavior is given by (2.15). adjusting ,  and  to all
have singularities at  = 0 takes care of three integration constants. another integration
constant is varied under the conformal rescalings in (3.6). this leaves two integration
constants. these are of a similar type as the previous example, although they are entangled
due to the coupling of the equations. the leading correction for  is 5a2 while the leading
correction to  is a2. these also generate corrections to . there is another integration
constant appearing at order 2 which can be adjusted to satisfy the constraint in (2.3),
leaving only one adjustable integration constant.

notice that since the uv eective coupling is g2

ef f  1/(log u), these subleading terms
look like instanton contributions. in the perturbative regime, we should expect instanton
contributions to be powers of u8n/3 = 2n/3. hence in the large n limit, no such terms
should appear2. since all elds lie in the adjoint representation, it is possible that there
are fractional instantons. however, these usually require fermion zero modes which are
conspicuously absent here.

another source for u1 corrections are scalar masses. these could be bare masses or
masses generated by quantum corrections. the ability to adjust the integration constants
on the type 0 gravity side could then correspond to the freedom to adjust the bare masses
on the eld theory side3. the powers of u could also just be an artifact of the strong
coupling expansion.
in any event, since this theory is not conformally invariant, there
does not seem to be any a priori reason why they should be set to zero. hence, we will
assume that these coecients are xed, but generic.

let us now try to match to ir solutions. one such solution was discussed in [25].
consider the ansatz where e4 is small compared to the other terms in v . this corre-
sponds to a small curvature for the 5 sphere. dropping this term, one can now nd an
exact solution to the equations of motion that satises the constraint. the solution is

e = c2

hence this solution is valid for large . from (3.7), the coupling blows up as    and

c2 remains as a leftover integration constant. as in the uv, the curvature in the ir
is small if g(t0) << 1. however, there is no reason to expect g(t0) not to be of order
unity. hence, as in the uv, the string corrections are of the same order as the classical
contribution.

while e blows up for this particular ir solution, one can easily see that the eective
coupling found from the heavy quark potential reaches a nite value. dening a new

hence, we see that this particular solution is a conformal xed point in the ir.

a possible cause of this behavior is that the su (n ) gauge group has been higgsed to
u (1)n1 by the adjoint scalars. naively, one expects a repulsive force between the branes
because of the extra r-r eld. in the large n limit, the branes could be pushed apart, but
still maintain the so(6) symmetry. the eect would be to have the branes smeared out
over some region with spherical symmetry and nite size. in the uv, well above the higgs
scale, the gauge group is unbroken and the coupling runs. in the infrared, the wilson loop

will probe down into this smeared region and see the eect of the broken gauge symmetry,
hence the quark potential behaves coulombically.

however, this ignores the role of the tachyon, which one might expect to lead to
attraction between the branes. from the perturbative side this seems reasonable, since

11

quantum uctuations would give masses to the scalar elds, removing the at directions

away from the unbroken gauge theory. there is a coleman-weinberg potential that is

unstable [37], but this requires ne tuning to get rid of the scalar mass.

connecting this ir solution to the desired uv solution is problematic. just as in the

uncoupled case, the generic ir behavior for    has the form

  0 + 0
  1 + 0
  2 + 0.

(3.13)

(3.14)

where the latter constraint also insures that 51 > 1
2 2, thus insuring that all terms
in the potential v have an exponential fallo. the uv solution is connected to the ir

2 1 + 1

solution in (3.7) by varying integration constants such that the i in (3.13) are set to zero.
from the ir side of things, we see that the i can all be set to zero by an innite rescaling.
but we do not want to do this since the rescaling will take the uv coupling to zero at

nite . hence we only have one free parameter to work with. thus we see that it is not

even guaranteed that that there exists an a1 and b1 that will connect the uv solution to
the ir conformal point. in fact, without some symmetry, it seems highly unlikely. even if

it is possible to set the i to zero, it is at best a horrendous ne tuning problem.

let us thus accept that the uv solution attaches to an ir solution with the asymptotic

behavior in (3.13), with nonzero i. in section 5 we will investigate the consequences of
this. before doing this let us round out this section by discussing the most general case
where g(t0) 6= 0.
in this case t will ow as  is varied and thus we have 4 coupled
nonlinear dierential equations. if g(t0) < 0 then t ows toward zero as  is increased.
one possible ir solution was discussed in [32] where  and  increase logarithmically, 

increases as a log of a log, and t relaxes to zero. the nice thing about this scenario is that
the behavior of g(t ) and f (t ) are known as t  0. unlike the previous case, there appear
to be enough integration constants in the uv to match solutions. the generic solution is

still of the form (3.13) with the additional equation

t  3 + t0.

the leading correction to t is (t++ + t ), where

 =

(1  p1  4f (t0)/f (t0)).

(3.16)

(3.17)

if f (t0) > f (t0)/4, which is the case for the function in (2.4), then we can write down
an oscillatory solution with an amplitude and a phase shift. hence, naively anyway, we
appear to have enough integration constants to match solutions. but matching to this
particular ir solution still requires a tremendous amount of ne tuning.

if f (t0)  f (t0)/4 then  would both be positive real and there would still be two
integration constants to adjust. this behavior would also x the problem of instabilities
due to the negative tachyon mass near the uv xed point. at this point, the space is
locally ads5 and so the condition for stability is that the tachyon mass satisfy m2  4
[38,39,3]. this is precisely the condition that f (t0)  f (t0)/4. if this condition were
satised then at the uv xed point the tachyon would couple to a relevant operator.

more generic is the case where t relaxes to zero or some other constant tir while
the other variables have the asymptotic behavior in (3.13). in this case, t  tir falls o
exponentially as   . we can see from the equations of motion for t that the second
derivative starts out positive, but becomes negative at some point before t = 0. hence,
it should be possible to nd a solution where t starts upward but then relaxes to some
nite point, while all the other elds grow linearly in .

finally, let us consider g(t0) > 0. now t ows away from t = 0 and there appear to
be no possible ir solutions except for those of (3.13) with i > 0 and (3.15) with 3 < 0.

4. possible validity for a class of infrared solutions

in order to trust the solutions with the asymptotic behavior in (3.13) and (3.15), it
is necessary to check that the higher  corrections are small. at rst glance, this would
appear to be a miserable failure. the curvature in the einstein metric ds2
e = e/2ds2,
where ds2 is the metric in (2.1), approaches

r  (cid:18) 1

2

1

2  52

2(cid:19) e(521/2).

13

(4.1)

this blows up as    because of the constraint in (3.16).

the leading string corrections are of the form 3e3/2w , where w is a combination
of four contracted riemann tensors. hence the naive dependence for the 3 terms using
the solutions in (3.13) is

e3/2w  e(2022130/2).

(4.2)

using the conditions in (3.16), one immediately sees that this term grows faster than r,

and hence the classical approximation breaks down.

however, w has a eld redenition ambiguity and can be written strictly in terms
of the weyl tensor c. for the einstein metric, the nonzero components of the weyl
tensor have the form

c = gg(a1f + a2g)e5/2,

(4.3)

where a1 and a2 are constants (dierent components have dierent constants), and f and
g are dened as

f = 2(   )  +   ,

g = 2  2 +     4e4.

(4.4)

it is clear that for a general solution in (3.13), both f and g are of order unity, and
so e3/2w blows up as in (4.2). however, if 2 = 1, then both terms are suppressed.
we actually should have anticipated this, since now the einstein metric approaches that
of the product space r+  m4  s5, up to a conformal transformation. recall that the
metric for the 3(4) dimensional witten model approaches the metric for the product space
r5  s5 (r6  s4) near the black hole horizon.

however, simply setting 2 = 1 is not sucient to insure that e3/2w blows up
slower than r. from the equations of motion in (2.6), we see that  has corrections of
order e21 and  has corrections of order e(0+1102)/2. letting 2 = 1, we nd in
general that f  e21 and g  e21, and thus

e3/2w  e(10130/2).

(4.5)

while the behavior has been softened, it is still not enough to prevent the 3 correction
from dominating r, since the maximum value for 0 consistent with (3.16) is 0 = 31.

14

however, there are solutions where w grows even slower than (4.5). if t approaches

a constant tir as   , then 3 = 0 and the asymptotic solution has the relations

0 = 31,

2 = 1.

(4.6)

for this case,  has corrections of order e21 and e31 while  has corrections of order
e31. it is a straightforward excercise to check that these corrections cancel in both f
and g and therefore

e3/2w  e51/2.

(4.7)

hence, not only does the term grow slower than r, it actually falls o exponentially!

we can also check the behavior for other types of terms. one class of terms has the

form [32]

falling o even faster than the rst string correction. there are also terms of the form

 e(2n3)1/2,

e/2(cid:16)e/2c(cid:17)n
e(n1)/2()n  e3(n1)1/2,

(4.8)

(4.9)

which again falls o rapidly. terms involving derivatives of the tachyon eld also have
exponential suppression since t approaches a constant value with exponential fallo. the
behavior of all these corrections leads us to speculate that there is a background that is
an exact solution of the  model which has the asymptotic behavior dened by (3.13) and
(4.6).

there is some ne tuning involved in connecting the desired uv solution to the ir
solutions in (4.6). we need to tune such that 1 = 2 and 3 = 0. if g(t0) = 0 then
3 = 0 is automatically satised.
in either case there are enough available integration
constants on the uv side which can be adjusted so that (4.6) is satised. hence, we
believe that there is a uv solution that connects to the ir solutions in (3.13) and (4.6).

5. connement in the infrared

in this section, we argue that the ir solutions of (3.13) and (3.15) lead to a linear quark
potential, magnetic screening and a discrete spectrum. the linear quark potential requires
the additional condition 1  0. happily, the solution in (4.6) satises this condition. it
is possible that other solutions besides (4.6) are valid, perhaps there is enough ambiguity
in the eective action to make their  corrections small as well. to allow for this, we will
discuss the general case in this section.

15

5.1. the quark potential

the quark potential is computed using the wilson loop calculation of [35,36]. the

nambu-goto action for a string in a curved background is given by

s =

1

2z dqdet(gm n x m x n ).

the quark potential is computed from the rectangular wilson loop, with two sides along
the time direction and the other two along one of the spatial directions. using the metric
in (2.1), we nd that the energy for the quark-antiquark pair is

(5.1)

(5.2)

(5.3)

(5.4)

e =

2z dxre5(cid:16) 
x(cid:17)2
changing variables such that du = e(5)/2d, we have
2z dxr(cid:16) u
x(cid:17)2

e =

where f (u) has the asymptotic behavior

1

+ f (u)/q,

+ e.

f (u) 

u4

(log u)2
2(1  0)
52  0

f (u)  u

 =

u >> 1

u << 1.

assuming that all i  0, the constraint equation (3.16) implies that the exponent for the
small u behavior satises  < 2. if 1 > 0, then 0 <  < 2, and thus for large enough
x, the minimum energy conguration consists of a string starting at u =  and going
straight down to the origin at u = 0, traveling a distance x along u = 0, and then going
back out to u = . since f (u) = 0 at u = 0, there is no cost in energy to separate the
quarks further, thus this would correspond to electric screening [40,41].

if instead 1 = 0, then u is no longer zero at the origin. in this case, for large
enough x the string will approach the origin and the quark potential becomes linear. if
1 < a0, then u blows up at the origin. in this case there will be some nonzero u0 such
that f (u0) is a minimum. for large enough x the string will approach this minimum value.
since f (u) is clearly positive for nonzero u, this too will lead to a linear quark potential.
assuming that the i are all of order 1, then the string tension will be of order 1/q in
the units used here.

if 1 < 0, then the coupling seen by the string is in some sense bounded in the
infrared. for large quark separation, the minimum energy conguration has u > u0, thus
the coupling approaches e0+1u0 . this is not to say that the behavior of the metric and
coupling for u < u0 will not aect other physical results, as we will see in the following
subsections.

16

5.2. magnetic screening

if there is connement, then there should be a corresponding screening of magnetic
charge. the computation is along the lines of [16]. in particular, we wish to compute the

potential between a monopole anti-monopole pair. this is accomplished by calculating the

rectangular wilson loop for a d string. in type 0 theory, since there are two types of r-r

kalb-ramond elds, there are also two types of d strings. however, only one type of d
string can end on the electric d3 brane. it is this string that describes the wilson loop for

a monopole.

the calculation is almost identical to the wilson loop calculation for the fundamental
string. the only dierence is that the integrand in (5.1) is multiplied by a factor of e.
hence, the potential is given by

+ e.

(5.5)

1

e =

2z dxre5(cid:16) 
x(cid:17)2
2z dxr(cid:16) u
x(cid:17)2

1

this time changing variables such that du = e(5)/2d, we have

e =

+ f (u)/q,

where now f (u) has the asymptotic behavior

f (u)  u4(log u)2
2(1 + 0)
52 + 0

 =

f (u)  u

u >> 1

u << 1.

(5.6)

(5.7)

since all i  0 and 52 > a1, then 0 <  < 2. hence, the monopole and anti-monopole
will screen at large distances

5.3. wkb estimates for the glueball spectrum

the correlator htr(f 2(x))tr(f 2(0))i is related to scalar greens functions in the bulk
[2,3]. a discrete spectrum for the bulk particles would correspond to a discrete spectrum for

the scalar glueballs [15]. since we are dealing with string tensions of order 1, the greens

functions of massive string states could be important. more to the point, the tachyon
couples to tr(f 2) [32,42]. if the tachyon is a bad tachyon, with plane wave normalizable
states in the bulk, then it cannot have a discrete spectrum. even if it is well behaved with
f (t0) < f (t0)/4, one might nd that the lowest lying state in the spectrum is tachyonic.

17

the linear equations one derives for the small uctuations are hopelessly entangled

through the tachyon mass term. as a rst approximation, one can ignore the cross terms

and simply consider the diagonal equations. let us make the usual ansatz and assume
that the 0++ glueball spectrum is determined by the spectrum for small uctuations of
the dilaton equation of motion. consider dilaton solutions of the form  = ()eikx,
where k2 = m 2. then the dilaton equation of motion reduces to




ge2g 


 + m 2ge2gxx +

g(t )g = 0,

1
4

(5.8)

where  in (5.8) refers to the background dilaton eld. substituting the metric in (2.1)

into (5.8) and using the equation of motion for the background dilaton eld, one nds

2
2  + m 2e5 

1
2

 = 0.

dening u as e5 = qu6p2/f (t0)/32, the equation of motion becomes

f (u)

 + m 2qh(u) + g(u) = 0,


u


u

(5.9)

(5.10)

where f (u), h(u) and g(u) have the asymptotic behavior

f (u)  u5
f (u)  u

h(u)  u
h(u)  u5

4u3
g(u) 
log u
g(u)  u7/2

u >> 1

u << 1.

(5.11)

note that the substitution for u requires that 52 > 1 in order that u  0 as   .
luckily, this inequality is guaranteed by (3.16).

using the arguments in [15], one can argue that the spectrum is discrete. in fact, we

can say more. since we know the asymptotic behavior, one can do the wkb calculation

described in [25]. the asymptotic behavior is similar to that of the three dimensional

witten model [15], although there will be log corrections because of the uv behavior

of g(u). the g(u) term does not aect the ir turning point to next to leading order.
borrowing the results in [25] and inserting the g(u) correction, we nd that the wkb 0++
glueball spectrum is

m 2 =

4cp2f (t0)

q

m(cid:18)m + 1 

2

log[cm(m + 1)](cid:19) + o(cid:18) m
log2 m(cid:19)

m  1,

(5.12)

18

where c is a constant of order unity. corrections to (5.12) coming from the inclusion of
cross terms are of order m/ log2 m. the log factors in (5.12) have the eect of dragging
down the glueball masses, which is clearly caused by the running of the coupling. this is

especially true for the lightest state. if c = 1 and one assumed that (5.12) were exact, then

one would nd that the lightest state is actually tachyonic. at this point we are unable to

prove that a tachyonic state does not appear. we can say that if a tachyonic state were

to exist for the dilaton equation in (5.8), then a minimum requirement is that there is
some region where 2 < 1/2. one can see that this is never true if we only consider
the leading order term in (2.15) for . numerical analysis seems to show that it is not

true if the higher order terms are also included. once we are safely in the infrared, then
 will be exponentially suppressed and so 2 > 1/2 in this region as well. however,
inclusion of the cross terms might drop the masses enough to leave a tachyonic glueball

state. hopefully this does not occur.

since q  n , we see that the glueball masses are a factor of n 1/4 smaller than
the square root of the string tension. this is not as severe as the 4 dimensional witten
model, where the masses are a factor of n 1/2 smaller [43]. we can also compare the
ratio of the rst excited glueball to the lowest mass state. since our knowledge of c is
limited, we can only put a lower bound on the mass ratios, which is reached when c  .
++/m++ > 3  1.73. the wkb
plugging in numbers, we nd that this ratio satises m
approximation for this ratio in the 4 dimensional witten model isp8/3  1.63 [25]. the

su (3) lattice result is 1.77  .14 [18].

we can also make wkb approximations for the glueball states with nontrivial so(6)
if we write the dilaton eld as  = ()eikxyl(5), then the

quantum numbers [44].

dilaton equation of motion reduces to

2
2  + m 2e5  l(l + 4)e4 

1
2

 = 0.

(5.13)

if 1  2, which is the case for (4.6), then the m 2 term will dominate the ( + 4) term as
u  0. in this case, the wkb calculation is a straightforward generalization of the l = 0
result and is

m 2 =

4cp2f (t0)

q

m(cid:18)m + 1 + l 

m  1.
(5.14)
if 1 < 2, then the asymptotic behavior changes near u = 0, but this eect only leads to
corrections of order 1 in m.

log[cm(m + 1)](cid:19) + o(cid:18) m
log2 m(cid:19)

2

19

we complete this subsection by computing the wkb spectrum for the 0+ glueballs.

in the witten model, this was done by studying the wave function for the 5 dimensional

dual of the ns-ns two form eld, which is a vector [19,22]. the component along the

euclidean time direction is a scalar in the four dimensional theory and is odd under parity.

in the case that we are studying, there is no euclidean circle, so we need to consider instead

the wave function for a scalar eld. the scalar eld is the iib axion which is an r-r scalar.

actually, there are two scalars, but only one couples to tr(fef ) on the electric d3 branes.
the other scalar couples to tr(fef ) on the magnetic d3 branes.

since the axion comes from the r-r sector, it does not couple to the dilaton4. hence,

the wave function has the form

e2 


e2 


a() + m 2e5 = 0.

(5.15)

dening a() = e(), (5.15) can be rewritten as

2
2  + m 2e5  ( + 2) = 0.

(5.16)

as was the case for the dilaton, the  terms do aect the next to leading order contribution
of the uv turning point. the 2 term also changes the next to leading order contribution

of the ir turning point. using the analysis in [25], one nds that the wkb mass expression
for the 0+ states are

m 2 =

4cp2f (t0)

q

m(cid:18)m + 1 +

20

52  1 

4

log[cm(m + 1)](cid:19) + o(cid:18) m

log2 m(cid:19) m  1

(5.17)
where c is the same constant as in (5.12). unlike the 0++ states, but like the 0+ states in

the russo generalization of the witten model [23,24,27], there is model dependence in these

glueball masses. using the solutions in (4.6) we nd as a lower bound for the mass ratio

m+/m++ > 7/2  1.32. the most recent lattice results have m+/m++ = 1.78  .24
for su (2) [18] and m+/m++ = 1.50  .04 for su (3) [45]

4 the axion does couple to the tachyon [28], but this does not aect the wkb approximation

to next to leading order.

20

6. discussion

one of the main dierences between the results found here and results found for the
witten model is that the type 0 model has a qcd scale set by dimensional transmutation.

hence, the glueball mass is directly related to the string scale. we have also found dif-
ferences for the mass ratios. the principle reasons for these dierences is that the type 0
model is four, not ve dimensional in the uv, and because the type 0 model has a running

coupling constant. the n dependence in the mass to string scale ratio is also aected by
the dierences in dimension. the witten model has a factor of n 1/2, while the type 0
model has a factor of n 1/4

the existence of the conning solutions does not contradict other results for ir xed
points. the ne tuning involved to reach such solutions could correspond to tuning mass

parameters on the eld theory side, so that for instance, the six scalars are massless after
including their quantum corrections. in this case, the eld theory could have the ir xed

point described in [32]. the conning solutions, which do not need to be ne tuned, have
massive scalars, and so are in the same universality class as pure su (n ).5

we have seen that while connement in the infrared is generic, there exists solutions
where many of the string corrections vanish exponentially. one such solution has a con-
stant tachyon expectation value. in some sense, this is closer to the spirit of polyakovs

noncritical string for qcd, where the nonzero tachyon expectation value, peacefully con-
densing in the bulk, plays the role of a nonzero central charge [31,46]. on the other hand,
the ve form ux through s5 clearly plays an important part here; without it we would
not have the log scaling in the uv.
