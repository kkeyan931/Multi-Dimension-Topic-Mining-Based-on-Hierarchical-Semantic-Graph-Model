scales of gaugino condensation and supersymmetry

breaking in nonstandard m-theory embeddings

zygmunt lalaka,b) and steven thomas c)

abstract

we investigate the formation of dynamical gaugino condensates and supersymmetry breaking
in the compactications of horava-witten theory with perturbative nonstandard embeddings.
specic models are considered where the underlying massless charged states of the condensing
sector are determined by the spectra of z2  z2 and z4 orbifolds with nonstandard
embeddings. we nd among them viable examples where gaugino condensation is triggered
on the wall with the weakest gauge coupling at mgu t . in all these cases the magnitude of the
condensate formed is below the energy scales at which extra dimensions are resolved, and so
justies the analysis of condensation in an eective 4-dimensional framework. we make some
comments concerning the size of the largest extra dimension in the models considered. we
discuss racetrack scenarios in the framework of perturbative nonstandard embeddings.

1 introduction

recent advances in our understanding of the nonperturbative aspects of string theory [1] from
which the idea of so called m-theory, which unies the 5 known types of string theory has
emerged, have continued to have a major impact on string inspired phenomenology. m-theory
phenomenology is now a rapidly growing eld which, perhaps for the rst time, is allowing us
to investigate detailed phenomenological questions in a consistent framework at large string
coupling. there is considerable promise in models derived from strongly coupled e8  e8
heterotic strings which in our present understanding is realized through the horava-witten (h-
w) construction of d = 11 supergravity compactied in a consistent way to d = 10 on s1/z2
[2], [3], [4]. this model provides a natural resolution to the old puzzle that was a feature of
perturbative heterotic theory, namely the consistency problems that arise if we demand that
reasonable values for mpl, mgu t and gu t should emerge in the eective d = 4 theory. this
resolution hinges on the fact that in the m-theory picture the eective string coupling is related
to the size of the line element s1/z2 which is large compared to the d = 11 planck length. at
the same time such a picture can naturally accommodate gauge coupling constant unication
at the experimentally favoured value of 2  1016 gev [3]. there is a growing body of work
dealing with phenomenological aspects of compactied hw theory. historically this began
within the context of the standard embedding [5] and more recently the analysis has been
extended to include nonstandard embeddings [6] - [11] 1 the correct procedure in obtaining
an eective d = 4 action is to rst integrate out the degrees of freedom on the 6-dimensional
calabai-yau manifold and then those compactied on s1/z2 [13], [14], [15], [16] , [17]. this new
picture provided by the h-w construction also suggests that the mechanism of supersymmetry
breaking should naturally be explored in d = 5 rather than the usual four dimensional setting
that is familiar in the weakly coupled case. this follows because consistency requires that the
scale of s1/z2 be hierarchically larger than the typical scale of the six dimensional compact
maniold which reduces the theory from d = 11 to d = 5 [3]. the e8 and e8 sectors of the four
dimensional world then live on the two boundaries of this d = 5 supergravity model. below the
mass scale m5 = 1/r5 it is adequate to describe the low energy physics within the framework
of the 4d n = 1 supergravity. in particular, in this framework one can study the dynamical
selection of the vacuum, and low energy supersymmetry breaking. the interesting question is
how the nontrivial 5d structure of the gauge sector, the fact that it consists of two spatially
separated, although correlated through the choice of the embedding sectors, becomes reected
in the low energy eective lagrangian. to get an insight into this problem, it is instructive to
study supersymmetry breaking in simple nonstandard embedding models in the horava-witten
setup.

reducing from d = 5 to d = 4 around bulk eld congurations that satisfy their equations of
motion is a natural way of encoding the supersymmetry breaking dynamics [16], [17], [18]. for
example if one considers supersymmetry breaking via the formation of gaugino condensates
on a wall then one approximation is to consider these as generating a delta function source
proportional to 3 where  is the scale at which condensation on that wall. it is then possible

1certain aspects of nonstandard embeddings in m-theory compactications were already discussed in [12].

1

in certain cases, see for instance [17], [18], to compute the size and nature of supersymmetry
breaking among observable elds.

clearly to obtain denite predictions for the scale of soft supersymmetry breaking parame-
ters one needs to know allowed values of . in this paper we want to address this question by
considering a number of explicit examples in which the scales  may be computed. to achieve
this requires knowledge of the massless charged spectrum present in the condensing sector as
the latter is triggered by the running gauge coupling being driven to values larger than unity.
for m-theory compactication on smooth calabi-yau (cy) manifolds, as in the case of weakly
coupled strings it is dicult to extract explicit data concerning the massless charged spectrum
in most cases. this is particularly the case of cy compactications whose gauge and tangent
bundle structure corresponds to nonstandard embeddings [19].

an alternative approach to the problem is to go to the singular limit of cy compactications
and work with orbifold compactications. in the weak coupling limit these spaces allow the full
computational power of string theory to be employed. the question arises whether the kinds of
data one can compute at weak coupling such as details of the massless charged spectrum, gauge
coupling threshold corrections, structure of the kahler geometry underlying the eective low
energy theory in d = 4 can somehow be extrapolated to the strong coupling region. in as much
as one can at present only work within the consistent eld theory limit of m-theory compactied
on x  s1/z2 of the hw construction the evidence points to many of the features familiar from
the weakly coupled theory surviving the extrapolation to strong coupling. an example of such
features are moduli dependent gauge coupling threshold corrections. in [20] (see [21] for earlier
work in the same direction) extrapolation of the latter to large string coupling by considering
the large t behaviour of modular invariant threshold corrections [22] , [23] results in a form of
the holomorphic f function that is consistent with the one based on the supersymmetrization
of wittens threshold formula obtained from m-theory [3]. this was originally carried out
for orbifolds with the standard embedding, but has recently a more general analysis has been
applied to the case of nonstandard embeddings [20]. the results agree with the generalization
of wittens threshold formula to include nonstandard embeddings [6]. these extrapolations
were based on modular invariant perturbative string models which match onto hw theory
with nonstandard embeddings but without 5-branes in the bulk. such extrapolations may also
exist in the case where such 5-branes are included [9], [10], [11], but an explicit calculation is
problematic as the corresponding weakly coupled strings are not modular invariant [20].

in this paper we consider nonstandard embeddings in hw theory without 5- branes in the
bulk, where the internal compact space is taken to be an n = 1 orbifold. for the purpose
of this paper we shall also assume that the renormalization group running of the d = 4 gauge
couplings on each wall to be determined by charged massless states living on the wall, the latter
being determined by the modular invariant orbifold construction at weak coupling.

2 condensates on opposite walls

following the reference [24] we shall summarize the main features of the racetrack models with
condensates forming in two dierent gauge sectors, with dierent gauge kinetic functions.

to begin with let us, however, comment on the connection between higher (5d) and four
dimensional eld theory in the h-w model. this issue has been studied in detail in [24]. here
we shall recall briey why do we expect the usual four dimensional physics to play the crucial
role in supersymmetry breaking and moduli stabilization. the general equation of motion for a
z2-even eld , with the sources jv(x), jh(x) localized on the walls and with the corresponding
boundary conditions on the half-circle

has the solution of the form (x, x5) = (x) + (x, x5). in that expression (x) is a truly four
dimensional uctuation, the zero mode on s1/z2, whereas  is the background depending on
x5, in the lowest order approximation given by [25, 17]

(x, x5) = jv + jh

(2)

this does not depend on the particular form of embedding, as explained in [6], but it relies
on the assumption, that the sources jv, jh vary signicantly only over the scales > ,
see [25] for details. this condition, on which the form of the explicit solutions of the bianchi
identity relies, is nontrivial, as the sources contain not only vacuum congurations, but also
include all the 4d uctuations of elds which penetrate the walls2. however, the assumption
about scales is fullled when one is solving for the vacuum congurations, which might break
supersymmetry, but should not break the 4d lorentz invariance, so cannot depend on x. at
vacuum, the function (x, x5) is determined in terms of the vacuum values of the sources, and
perhaps by nontrivial physics in the bulk, like sigma-model interactions, but the zero mode
(x) , with no dependence on x5, is left completely undetermined. this mode shall eventually
be regarded as the massless eld in 4d, and has to be determined by nontrivial 4d dynamics
born on the walls. let us note, that even in the schemes where bulk dynamics is credited for
stabilization of some of the moduli like the radius of the fth dimension, see [26], a nontrivial
potential on the walls is necessary for stabilization3.

after this introductory comment, we can move on to the discussion of condensates, which
are the obvious source of stabilizing potentials and/or hierarchical supersymmetry breaking.
to be reasonably general let us start with an arbitrary number of condensates on any of the two
walls (see also discussion in [27]). with 4d gauge kinetic functions of the form f1,2 = s  0t

2after the averaging over the compact 6d space has been performed.
3for earlier arguments similar to that of [26] see [17]. the nontrivial warp factor used explicitly in [26] is
strictly speaking a higher order correction from the point of view of [17], since boundary sources are already
corrections in the expansion in powers of 2/3 (where  is the d = 11 gravitational coupling).

where i = 1 and the rest of the notation is standard and given in [24]. first, let us look for the
at space supersymmetric points of the potential (3). one reason is purely technical, namely it
is much easier to nd such candidate points than to look for broken supersymmetry solutions
to the full equations of motion. secondly, as we expect the realistic supersymmetry breaking
scale to be hierarchically smaller than the planck scale, one can expect the relevant points
where supersymmetry is only slightly broken, to be located near the globally supersymmetric
points (although the existence of remote relevant susy breaking points cannot be excluded in
general). as we are looking for at space solutions, we shall assume the vacuum expectation
value of the total superpotential to be zero, which is consistent in the picture with explicit
gaugino bilinears, as it does not lock to each other the values of various condensates. then,
the scalar potential takes the form

and is equivalent to the potential obtained in the globally supersymmetric limit in the eective
superpotential approach to multiple condensates. it is easy to see that existence of supersym-
metric minima implies that the sum of condensates vanishes separately on each wall

at such points in eld space. here i+, i run over the number of condensates present on wall
1 and wall 2 respectively and {i} = {i+, i}.

i+ = 0 = x 3

(5)

in the case of at least two condensates on each wall, equations (5) are two independent
equations for two complex variables es0t , so generically they have a solution at nite values
of s and t . the situation is such, that condensates on each wall optimize themselves and
supersymmetry is unbroken, but the values of s and t become xed. this is an interesting
possibility, and it would be an interesting exercise to check which values of re(s) and re(t )
can be obtained in such a setup, but in this paper we want to stay specically within the class
of calculable perturbative nonstandard embeddings discussed in [20], and there doesnt seem
to be enough space for  4 condensates with realistically low condensation scales.

hence we have to look at the vacua with 3 or less condensates. these are the interesting
cases, given our comments above. first, when we want to have 3 condensates arranged on
dierent walls, then one of them must be on one wall, and two on the opposite. then it follows
immediately that to fulll the unbroken susy conditions the single condensate would have to
vanish. with three nonvanishing condensates on both walls we therefore always have broken
supersymmetry. the same applies, as pointed out in [24], to the case of two condensates on
dierent walls.

when we have several condensates on a single wall, then this works similarly to the weakly
coupled case: supersymmetry is unbroken, but only s + 0t or s  0t is xed. to have a hope

4

to x both moduli within the simple, and perhaps most appealing, version of the racetrack
scheme one clearly needs to consider condensates on both walls.

to conclude, in the most interesting case of two or three condensates on dierent walls,
we can exclude the existence of at space, unbroken supersymmetric ground states. this is
not so bad however, because the existence of remote minima, disconnected from any globally
supersymmetric state, cannot be excluded by a general reasoning.
in fact, if one nds any
proper minimum of the eective potential in these cases, supersymmetry is guaranteed to be
broken there. however, to have a vanishing cosmological constant at such a minimum, one has
to invoke a nonzero expectation value of the superpotential, and it would have to be of the
order of 3
ef f /m. one source of such eectively
constant terms in the superpotential could be condensates of the chern-simons forms, but then
the question of the scale and stiness of these condensates arises, which we shall not discuss
here. it is worth noting that even if the constant in the superpotential is present, then on the
basis of the dynamics described by (3) one cannot tell whether it makes ft or fs vanish. in
fact, the most plausible situation in such a case is that supersymmetry is unbroken, moduli
xed, but the cosmological constant is nonzero.

ef f if we are to get the usual hierarchy f  3

having discussed issues of moduli stabilization, there is in addition the requirement that
the condensation scale on the walls be hierarchically smaller than mp l in order to have a hope
of realistic phenomenology. of course it remains a hope that in the interesting cases mentioned
above where racetrack xing of moduli occurs, such a hierarchy of scales appears for a choice of
embeddings. whether this is possible or not, we can at least within the perturbative orbifold
framework of nonstandard embeddings [20] estimate the size of condensates in some simple
cases, even if we do not at the same time immediately address the issue of moduli stabilization.
this will be the subject of the next section. in models where only a single t modulus exists
(whose real part is proportional to the size of the 5th dimension) the form of  is tightly
constrained if one uses as input the preferred values of gu t , mgu t and mp l. if one can nd
reasonable values for the condensate in these models it would provide further motivation to
tackling the larger problem of stabilization.

in the next section we discuss in detail potentially realistic examples, where at the string
scale, with trivial vacuum for the scalar elds, there is just one asymptotically free nonabelian
factor. to repeat, the analysis is valid in the vicinity of the trivial scalar vacuum. however, in
these models there are more than one nonabelian factors. in addition, usually the perturbative
scalar potential has at directions, along which some of the large nonabelian groups can be
broken in such a way, that there appear additional nonabelian factors which are asymptotically
free. it is straightforward to generalize in this spirit the stringy analysis we give here along the
lines of [28]. this way one can easily generate models with two or three condensates.

3 scales of gaugino condensation in m-theory on s1/z2:

weak and strong wall cases

as was discussed in [6] one can make use of the dierent routes in compactifying m-theory
to four dimensions, to obtain a map between strong and weakly coupled compactication
moduli. this involves compactifying from 11  10  4 or 11  5  4 the starting metric
in 11 dimensions is the same, but in the rst case we can naturally express parameters of
the d = 11 metric in terms of familiar moduli of weakly coupled 10 dimensional heterotic
string theory whilst in the second we have a natural expression in terms of strong units. if
for example we consider case of homogeneous calabi-yau compactication, then in the weak
case we have g(10)
m n ,  = 0..3, m = 4..9 with  the breathing mode
of the homogeneous cy space. along with the dilaton  this denes the real parts of weak
moduli sw and tw as re(sw) = e33/4, re(tw) = e3/4. the  eld can be thought of as
g(11)
11,11 = 2 with a weyl rescaling g(11)
ab , a = 0..9 to obtain canonical gravitational
in the strong route to four dimensions, one identies moduli through
action in d = 10.
m n = eg(11)
55 = e2 equating g(11)
mn = e2g(11)
g(11)
55 we nd the relation
 = e. similarly comparing g(11)
m n we obtain e = 1/4e in this way one nds a map
between weak and strong moduli which leads one to dene re(ss) = e3 = re(sw)(, )
and re(ts) = e = re(tw)(, )where the subscript s refers to strong quantities .

in the same way one can consider inhomogeneous cy spaces with dierent scaling moduli.
in the orbifold limits these moduli are associated with the scaling modes of the underlying
6dimensional torus as i i = 1, 2, 3 where i labels the 3 complex planes. if we include the
generalized strong moduli i then a similar analysis to above yields the relations  = epi i
and ei = 1/4ei which leads to the denitions re(ss) = epi i , re(tsi) = e(ei 1
3pi i) in

this case. such maps between strong and weak moduli allow one to extrapolate various weak
coupling quantities to the strongly coupled regime. one may wonder if such extrapolations
are consistent. in the case where one includes 5-branes in the bulk [9] , [16], [11], there would
appear to be problems in this respect as the corresponding weakly coupled string theory is not
modular invariant [20]. if we consider the case where such 5-branes are absent (which we assume
in the remainder of the paper) the answer seems more encouraging particularly regarding the
moduli dependent threshold corrections. computing these quantities in the m- theory regime
conrms that they can be obtained by the maps considered above as if we additionally take
the large ti limit. the latter ensures that the moduli dependent thresholds are at most linear
in the elds, which is within the horava-witten approximation to m-theory. thus in what
follows we will assume the perturbative results for threshold corrections in the context of n=1
orbifold compactications and apply the above mentioned extrapolations. in what follows we
shall drop the s subscript on all moduli.

we begin with a discussion of threshold eects in e8 e8 heterotic m-theory. in the case of
smooth calabi-yau compactication, the dierence in the unied gauge couplings 2

on the hidden and visible walls, for general embedding [6] can be obtained as a generalization

this particular embedding gives the specic gauge group structure e6(v) e8(h). we stress that
since nr has positive sign, there is no way of changing the sign of 1
h without going
to an entirely dierent gauge group structure, which means going to a new, dierent from the
standard one, embedding. in the s and t notation we have ( = 1/2 )

standard embedding case where standard model gauge group and matter representations are
associated with the e6 sector. however it may well be that for certain embeddings the standard
model matter might emerge from either wall, thus leading to the possibility that visible matter
has strongest gauge coupling at mgu t (explicit examples are given later) we continue to use
the labeling v and h in the general case but the latter point should be borne in mind .

so far these thresholds apply in the case of smooth cy spaces. we are interested in this
in [20] this

paper in the orbifold limit, in which case we need the analogue of eq(7) , (8).

problem was addressed within the context of nonstandard embeddings and the m-theory limit.
it was argued that topological integrals in eqs(7),(8) would only be nonvanishing if there are
codimension 2 xed points appearing. from this it was argued that eectively dynamics of
k3  t 2 compactication controls the non-zero su2 instanton numbers. the orbifold limit
then corresponds to taking k3 orbifolds t 4/g where g is an appropriate discrete group. the
computation of allowed instanton numbers of gauge and tangent bundles over k3 is simplied
if the point like singularities of t 4/g are repaired by so called ale spaces [20]. in this case
the su2 instanton numbers n(1)

cy space x and ji a basis for (1, 1) forms. one can further express n(1)
in terms of the
i
orbifold data such as order of xed points  and shifts i
 dened by the n = 2 embedding
[20]. because of the k3  t 2 structure, the bianchi identities imply that n(1)
i = k3 = 24.
thus in going to the orbifold limit of cy spaces we are forced to consider a more restrictive set
of instanton numbers than in the smooth case. the corresponding expressions for the m-theory
threshold corrections, analogous to eq.(12 ) will be [20]

the observation that it is k3  t 2 dynamics that controls the thresholds corrections via
the su2 instanton numbers is completely consistent with the perturbative picture of threshold
corrections which are also associated with the existence of n = 2 supersymmetric xed planes
[22], [29] .

let us contrast the above threshold corrections to the following exact form of the holomor-
phic couplings in the large t i limit of orbifold compactication in e8  e8 heterotic string [22].

note that there is no explicit group index appearing in the above denitions, so that if the
unbroken gauge group in the four dimensional eective theory is indeed a product of simple
factors (in either the weak or strong sector ) then the expressions for the n = 2 beta functions
must coincide for each group factor. this can be seen in a number of explicit examples discussed
in [20] and also is implicit in the nonstandard embedding orbifold examples in [22] . the
holomorphic f functions can be written as

where in these equations we have returned to the denition of s and t i moduli with the

normalizations given earlier.

before we consider the specic scale of gaugino condensation, we can write down a general
form for the n = 1 beta functions that will appear in the expression for gaugino condensates,
using previous relations, again in the extrapolated orbifold limit:

where the apostrophe  distinguishes matter representations coming from hidden sector.
again we emphasise that in these formulae, the i labels a single xed plane under the action
of the orbifold point group.

we can now write the following general expressions for the v and h sector gaugino conden-

sates v, h. in the case of v sector condensation, (we set kv = kh = 1 for simplicity)

where in both these expressions  = 1
ni). in the examples based on perturbative non-
standard embeddings in orbifolds which we discuss below, it turns out that condensation occurs
on only one wall at a time. as was mentioned in the last section, while this is not the most
interesting case from the point of view of complete dynamical xing of moduli, it will pro-
vide a framework in which to estimate the scale of soft susy breaking. this simplication of
single wall condensation means that the expression for the observable inverse gauge coupling
1
gu t = 4(sr  tr) when condensation occurs on the weaker wall in the v sector, whereas if
it occurs on the strong wall 1
gu t = 4(sr + tr). of course in either case the triggering of
condensation requires the particularly sector to contain gauge and massless matter elds that
lead to an asymptotically free theory. this requires a negative bv or bh and we shall discuss
these conditions shortly.

now we note that the lowest order (in 2/3 ) 6 t to the 4-dimensional planck mass mpl and

gut scale mgu t gives

which shows that the vacuum expectation value of tr is not a free parameter. from this
constraint it can be seen that in general the scale of the condensate is given as a function of
mpl, mgu t , gu t , ni, i
i  and dynkin
labels tv(ri), th(ri ). note that if we take mpl, mgu t , gu t as more or less xed by the
mssm (at this point we put aside the possibility of so called strong unication [31] ), then the
remaining parameters depend on the specic details of choice of n = 1, d = 4 orbifold, along
with choice of embedding, wilson lines etc.

before looking at some detailed models, it is worth investigating in the orbifold limit of
horava-witten m-theory, if one can realize the scenario discussed in [6] that condensation can
occur on either of the two walls, with corresponding observable sectors on opposite wall. firstly
let us note that in the weakly coupled heterotic compactications, there appears somewhat
dierent constraint on the allowed values of modular weights ni
i  depending on whether one
considers large volume smooth calabi-yau or singular orbifold compactications. in the former
[32] it has been noted that calculations of matter eld contributions to the kahler potential
show that in this case, in known examples, the modular weights are ni
i  = 1/3, which
is characteristic of matter elds arising from the untwisted sectors of orbifolds. these values
imply that in the expressions for the n = 1 beta functions given above, the terms corresponding
to matter irreps drop out, and one nds

i = ni

(27)

where we have substituted for orbifold expressions for the n=2 beta functions in each sector,
since as argued in [20], the value of these quantities is not expected to change in going from
cy to the orbifold limit. thus in the cases where i
gs = 0, we nd that there is quite a strong
constraint on the allowed values of the beta functions. recall that in our choice of embeddings,
ni < 0 (with the standard embedding corresponding to ni = 12 ), so that it is clear that
condensation can only occur in the h sector under these conditions. if we relax i
gs = 0 then
since kv, kh are both positive integers (by assumption that the corresponding ane algebras are
unitary) the only possibility to realize condensation in v sector is to take i

gs < 0.

even then, we have to ensure that even if i

gs is suciently negative to turn bv negative, it
must not at the same time turn bh negative since it is the h sector where we identify with the
observable sector , e.g. the mssm where we know that the corresponding beta functions are
positive. thus it is clear that some kind of hierarchy between the levels kv and kh is needed
if this mechanism is to work, the question is how large should this be ? and in addition how
negative should i
gs be? evidently we need to constrain |ni| so that the terms independent of
i
gs in both beta functions is positive , which requires |ni| < 2 or since the ni are integer and
negative, we are lead t specically ni = 1. we then nd the inequalities |khi
and
|kvi
. this requires kv > 3kh. although
it may seem that one may have arbitrarily large values of kv, kh in fact from the formulae given
earlier for i
gs we see that the latter are integer valued, which clearly bounds allowable values
of the levels.

of gu t and gs for various values of kv, kh satisfying kv > 3kh one can see that reasonable
values may be obtained but the question remains if one can easily nd explicit models with
these values of kv, kh and gs.

i = ni

having discussed the case relevant to large volume calabi-yau compactication with all
modular weights ni
i  = 1/3 we want to consider compactications on n = 1 orbifolds
where more general values of the modular weights occur. this means that there is a weaker
connection between the n = 2 and n = 1 beta functions since now matter representations
contribute to the right hand side of eq(23) . therefore we are forced to consider explicit orbifold
models, where the full n = 1 charged, massless spectrum is known in which to evaluate the size
of the gaugino condensate . in this paper we look at all the nonstandard embeddings in z2 z2

12

and z4 orbifolds (here we do not consider wilson lines) and consider what gauge sectors in
each model can support gaugino condensation. also we shall determine (if condensation does
occur), whether it falls into the class of weaker wall or stronger wall condensation in the
sense dened earlier. such a possibility is a consequence of nonstandard embeddings. first we
consider z2  z2 models. there are 5 modular invariant embeddings of the point group into
e8  e8 including the standard embedding giving the unbroken gauge group e6  u 2
1  e8.
details of these models together with the full charged massless spectrum is given in [22]. the
gauge coupling threshold corrections in this case will depend on all three ti., i = 1, ..3 since
each complex plane has a nontrivial little group among the z2  z2 generators. moreover
since each such little group denes a z2, one also has three u-moduli ui, which the threshold
corrections also depend on (infact in a way which respects ti , ui exchange symmetry [22])
as usual the t -moduli are associated with deformation of kahler class whilst ui modify the
complex structure. in determining the allowed values of the gaugino condensate, we have to
take into account the constraint that connects mpl with mgu t , gu t and other parameters
appearing in the m-theory compactication to d = 4 in the case of several ti moduli , the
formula for mpl is generalized to

re(ti))1/3 =

gu t

which xes the overall modulus (qi re(ti))1/3 in terms of mgu t , mpl and gu t . here

mgu t is as given in eq(26) with the denition of s generalized to the inhomogeneous cy case
as discussed earlier. but this still leaves a certain freedom in the precise values of ti . we shall
see in a moment that certain values of ti might be favoured over others. note that this relation
does not involve the ui so its dynamics are less constrained by realistic values for mpl, mgut
etc.. although the threshold corrections do depend on ui we shall set ui = 0, i = 1, ..3 in what
follows and comment on the signicance of non-zero ui at the end. table 1 shows z2z2 models
with nonstandard embeddings, and corresponding gauge groups. note that only 2 of these have
sectors which give negative n = 1 beta function when one includes all charged massless matter
listed in [22] and hence allow condensation to occur. table 2 also lists the corresponding value
of the instanton numbers ni corresponding to each n = 2 plane, and which dictate the explicit
moduli dependence of the gauge coupling threshold corrections (eq.(22))

as discussed in [22] there are basically two distinct n = 2 gauge groups associated with the
possible n = 2 planes, namely e7  su2  e8 or e7  su2  so16 with n = 2 massless matter
content described in [22] . the surviving n = 1 gauge group, obtained after gso projection
will be a subgroup of either of these. note in z2  z2 the gs coecients i
gs = 0 and we take
levels kh and kv for all non-abelian factors to be unity. also in this case |d|/|di| = 2 for all
planes. although in principle the condensate  can depend on all three real moduli reti , for
now we simplify matters by considering its dependence in the direction t1 = t2 = a t3  a t
where a is some positive real parameter. then eectively  depends on 2 of the three real
parameters, a and ret. the relation eq(29) will x ret so that  is naturally a function of
the scale a and gu t assuming mpl is xed. we will comment on more general case later.

the expressions for the f functions and condensate scale  in the condensing models 1 and

(31)

in obtaining these expressions we have solved the constraint eq(29) for t . note that in
both cases the condensing sector has the strongest coupling of the two walls at the gut scale,
which can be seen from the relative minus signs in the corresponding threshold corrections.

in figures 1-2 we have plotted  as a function of the scale a and gu t , where the range
of values of gu t are chosen near the mssm preferred value of 0.04. what is particularly
interesting about both plots is that they show that the condensate has a dependence on a
which has a distinct minimum. this suggests that the dynamics of the condensate might be
such that it would adjust itself to favour a close to its minimum. strictly speaking one should
minimize not  but rather the eective potential v given in the section 2. however one can
check that the position of the minima in ti space is only shifted slightly, with the value of a at
the minimum remaining unchanged, so figures 1-2 are qualitatively correct. in model 1, the
minimum is close to a = 1 which corresponds to the overall modulus direction t 1 = t 2 = t 3
in moduli space. the condensate in model 2 shows a minimum close to a = 3. the value of
/mpl is seen to be about 105 for model 1 and 7  104 in model 3, again assuming values of
gu t close to 0.04. the scale of  in the latter case might seem to be too high for intermediate
scale supersymmetry breaking, but infact in this case  is very sensitive to the value of gu t
chosen.

for example choosing gu t = 0.02 gives   5  106 mpl. moving on to consider more
generic points in the t i moduli space, it turns out that there is a global minimum of v
as a function of re(t 2), re(t 3) (solving the constraint eq(29) in terms of re(t 1) ). these
lie approximately along the directions t 1 = t 2 = t 3 and t 1 = t 2 = 3t 3 for models 1 and 3

14

respectively, as can be seen in figures 3-4. hence studying the condensate along such directions
is natural.

let us now move on to discuss the case of nonstandard embeddings in z4 orbifolds. again
if we do not consider wilson lines, there are 12 inequivelant modular invariant embeddings
of the z4 point group generated by  = (i, i,1) into e8  e8 (e.g. see [33]). as usual the
moduli dependent threshold corrections depend on the n = 2 invariant planes, which in this
case corresponds to the i = 3 plane which has little group d  z2. as is argued in [22] this
fact implies that the gs coecients i
gs are vanishing in all z4 orbifolds as indeed they are for
the z2  z2 models discussed above. the only nonvanishing instanton numbers are n3 and are
determined by the n = 2 gauge group and spectra corresponding to this xed plane. since the
little group is again z2 there are just two possible n = 2 supersymmetric sectors which we label
type a and b. type a has gauge group e7  su2  e8 and massless charged elds consisting
of 2 (56, 2; 1) 16 (56, 1; 1) 64 (1, 2; 1). type b has gauge group e7  su2  so16 and
massless charged elds consisting of 2 (56, 2; 1) 2 (1, 1; 128) 16 (1, 2; 16). in addition
there are of course the massless vector multiplets that can, after the full projection that breaks
n = 2 to n = 1, give rise to charged massless chiral multiplets. all this means that in n = 1
models based on type a, n = 2 sectors, the instanton number is n3 = 12 and those based
on type b have n3 = 4. table 2 lists the allowed nonstandard embeddings, and in each case
one can determine by inspection which of the models type a or b they are associated with. to
determine the exact embedding of the n = 1 gauge group into n = 2 requires comparing the
n = 1 massless spectra with the n = 2 spectra listed above 7. this identication is important
in deducing whether the condensing sector is the more strongly or weakly coupled, a fact which
has important consequences that we discuss later. for example in the case of model 1, we have
n = 1 gauge group e6  su2  e7  su2 which is naturally associated with type a, n = 2
gauge group. the threshold corrections relevant in the m-theory region are therefore (we dene
t i=3 = t )

fe6 = s +

163 t = fsu2

fsu2 = s

(32)

which shows that e6 and su2 gauge sectors are more weakly coupled and in this example
gauginos of the e7 sector condense.

an example of an n = 1 spectra based on type b, n = 2 gauge group is in model2 of table

2. here we nd

fe6 = s

163 t = fsu2

7for brevity we have not listed the various n = 1 charged massless states of the models listed in tables 1

and 2.

(33)

thus in this case the so16 is the more weakly coupled (at mgu t ) and is also the sector
where condensation occurs. in a similar manner one can derive the threshold corrections for
the models listed in table 2 and determine the weaker/stronger coupled sector.

in order to compute the n = 1 beta functions with a view to discovering which models
can support gaugino condensation, it is necessary to have knowledge of the complete charged
massless spectrum. in [34] a classication of the tk twisted sectors of z2k, n = 1 orbifolds was
presented. in the present case of z4 [33] list the massless states from the t1 and t2 twisted
sectors. to complete the analysis we have just to consider if any additional massless states can
arise from the twisted sector t3 ( k = 0..3, with t0 corresponding to the untwisted sector in
the z4 case ). the equations dening massless right and left-moving states are

are oscillator numbers in the right and left moving degrees

the point group element  acting on the so(8) bosonized fermion lattice is represented by
the shift vector given by v = 1
4(1, 1,2, 0). the normal ordering constants ck are c1 = c3 = 5/16
and c2 = 1/4. now since min((p + 3 v)2) = 22/16 (where p is an so(8) lattice vector) it is
clear that there are no additional massless modes coming from the t3 twisted sector. (in the
t2 sector for example there are massless states since now min((p + 2 v)2) = 1/4. thus the end
result is that we can use the states given in [33] to determine the n = 1 beta functions in
z4 models and those which have negative values, and which are therefore relevant in gaugino
condensation are listed in table 2. from our above discussion of stronger and weaker coupled
sectors at mgu t , it turns out that all of the models that support a condensing sector, this
sector is the more strongly coupled except in two cases: models 2, 4 and 9 where this occurs in
the weaker sector. since in the z4 case there is only one t modulus contributing to thresholds,
the size of the condensate (either v or h as appropriate ) is only a function of gu t ( for
xed mpl and mgu t ).

before closing it is worth while considering what the largest allowable value for the radius
of the 5th dimension can be in the models considered in this paper, consistent with the various
constraints on low energy couplings etc that we have seen above. there has been much recent
interest in models that macroscopically large (wrt e.g. the gut scale 2  1016 gev ) extra
spatial dimensions.

one of the basic constraints related to the maximum physical size of the 5th dimension,
8 and the choice of whether the observable sector lies on the wall that is more

 = re(t )0

8in [6] we argued that a natural choice for the reference scale 0 is through  =

h = 1

gu t = res  ret and 1

weakly/strongly coupled. in the former case we have the relation gu t = res + ret (here for
simplicity we consider a single modulus t ) from which the gauge coupling on the hidden wall
can be expressed as 1
gu t  2 ret . clearly this choice reveals the critical upper bound
on ret and the scale of the 5th dimension  (for a xed value of mgu t )if we demand that the
hidden sector gauge coupling remain nite [3]. although the exact value of this critical radius
depends on the size of the threshold coecients  in the models we have considered in this
paper there will be rough agreement of  = for the choice mgu t = 2  1016gev . the other
case one might have (which is realized in models 1, 4 and 9 of the z4 orbifolds listed in table
2) is that the stronger coupled sector contains the observable sector in which case we have the
gut scale relation 1
gu t + 2 ret . thus there is no critical
radius in this picture, if we imagine gu t as xed. in both cases however, ret is determined
by the requirement of obtaining the correct value of mpl once gu t and mgu t are xed. but
one can imagine (as in [8] ) lowering the value of mgu t from 2  1016gev , which would mean
obtaining something other than the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model
in d = 4. by lowering mgu t (or in other words increasing  ) it would seem we can make 
larger by not only the increase in  but also of ret through the relation eq(26). however if we
want to include the mechanism of hidden wall gaugino condensation to break supersymmetry
as we have discussed in this paper, then this provided additional bounds on the maximum
values of . this follows from the fact that if the wall on which condensation occurs is the
more weakly coupled, then lowering mgu t forces the hidden sector gauge coupling at mgu t to
smaller values and consequently it requires a longer renormalization group running (for a given
value of bh ) in order to trigger condensation. this fact coupled with the lowering of mgu t
both point to a lowering of the scale  at which the gauginos condense. we have seen in this
paper that for the models considered we already obtain values of  around the optimal value of
1012 1013 gev for gravity mediated soft supersymmetry breaking with mgu t = 2 1016 gev.
a natural lower bound on mgu t would then be that which gives   105 gev which would
correspond to gauge mediated soft supersymmetry breaking. from our discussions above this
provides an upper bound on .

let us state the results. in the z2  z2 case, and model 1, taking the direction ret 1 =
ret 2 = a ret 3 = a ret (with the dynamically favoured value a = 1 as discussed earlier)
we nd the critical value retc  100 for gu t = 0.04 so that the physical critical radius
c = 16(2gu t )1/6m1
gu t . the actual value of ret obtained from the constraint eq(29), with
above value of gu t and mgu t = 2 1016gev is ret  78 which is close to the critical value.
because of this proximity and the fact that ret is very sensitive to mgu t and  decreasing
exponentially fast with t infact we cannot reduce mgu t by much more than a factor of 2 or so.
this implies the upper bound on the physical length  is only a few times that of the critical
radius c given above. in model 3 retc  50 for the mssm values of gu t , mgu t . however
we have see that at these values ret  78 and we are in a forbidden region. infact to remedy
this one can either decrease gu t slightly or increase mgu t to avoid this problem. for example
in the plot of  in this case (fig. 2) we have taken gu t > 0.02.

in the z4 case there are two possibilities: either strong or weak wall condensation may
occur. in the former, the analysis follows as above but now critical values of t are re = 160
or re = 480 depending on whether the particular n = 1 gauge group originates from either

the type a or b n = gauge group discussed earlier. these allow for slightly smaller reductions
in mgu t before ret reaches its critical value than in the z2  z2 case being typically 1/5 and
1/10 times the mssm value of 2  1016 gev. potentially the more interesting case is weak
wall condensation where the critical radius is absent, and it would seem large values of  are
possible. however the bounds that   105 gev together with the observation that  decreases
exponentially with t which is itself varies as (mp l/mgu t )2 mean that mgu t cannot be lowered
signicantly. in models 1 and 9 for example, we typically can only lower by a factor of 1/2 or
1/3 wrt to the mssm value, and hence the maximum values of the radius  are again only a
few times the critical values.

it is clear that since the magnitude of the n = 1 beta function in the condensing sector can
never be too large (it is 90 for unbroken e8) this restriction on the lowering of mgu t and
the consequent increase of  is pretty strong and fairly generic. one possible means around
this would be if one could nd threshold corrections involving several ti- moduli where the
instanton numbers ni have opposite signs for at least two values of the index i. then one can
imagine that the above lower bound on mgu t could be weakened if partial cancellation occurs
amongst the moduli in the threshold corrections, as we lower mgu t and hence increase reti. it
would be interesting to nd orbifold models where this happens and to estimate the maximum
allowed value of  which might be orders of magnitude larger than c.

as noted at the end of section 2, it is straightforward to construct models with two or
three condensates using the basis models from tables 1 and 2. to achieve this, one needs to
identify suitable f and dat directions in the eective eld theoretical lagrangian. then,
typically, nonvanishing vevs of scalar elds along these at directions can be chosen in such a
way, that there remain additional nonabelian sectors with negative beta function coecients,
thus providing additional condensates. this can happen for instance to one of the so8 factors
in the model 1 from table 1, or to the e6 factor in the model 1 of table 2. detailed study of these
models requires identication of the yukawa couplings, i.e. of the perturbative superpotential,
for all the massless states. this is doable, however complete analysis of this type lies beyond
the framework of the present paper. preliminary considerations support clearly the scenario
outlined in section 2.

4 soft terms

in this section we want to consider typical expressions for soft supersymmetry breaking opera-
tors that are induced due to the presence of a gaugino condensates on either of the walls, or on
both of them. this mechanism is naturally described within a 5d framework where transmis-
sion of supersymmetry breaking between walls occurs through bulk eld interactions with the
walls. although the framework of 5d supergravity is well established, there are subtleties that
arise in the h-w formalism when reducing to d = 4 in the presence of condensates, which were
discussed in [24]. there, it was argued that a method of reduction from d = 5 to d = 4 that
captures the dynamics of the h-w picture, is to integrate out (via their equations of motion)
the bulk elds that couple to condensates on (in general) both walls. in this way one obtains
the following set of soft operators in the case that condensates i, i = 1, 2 = (+,) appear on
opposite walls [24]

if we now consider the single condensate case (e.g. 2 = 0 ) then it is clear from the above
expressions that 1 sets the scale for the soft terms, as well as the appearance of reduced planck
mass m in the expression for gravitino masses. it is interesting to see the dependence of the
various soft terms on  ( which corresponds to a choice of nonstandard embedding), in the case
where we take standard model values for gu t and mgu t , and eliminate res, ret using the
earlier denitions and the t to mpl in d = 4 . although applying this procedure gives soft
terms that depend on , plotting these in a model independent fashion is problematic, since
we know that the beta function coecients in 1 change as  varies. a better solution is to
normalize the plots by dividing the soft term by appropriate powers of 1 and m (eectively
yielding dimensionless expressions). this is what we have done in figures 5-7 9 (in the case
of chiral scalar masses we plot the diagonal combination k1ijm2jk m 4/3
1). to get absolute
normalization of soft terms in a given model requires the data from the plots together with the
value of 1 in the model.

the striking feature of the pattern of the soft breaking operators is the strongly marked
asymmetry between soft terms for elds stemming from dierent walls, both for small and large
values of the tan(). it is straightforward to imagine the standard model group to be a mixture
of the gauge factors originally10 contained in both e8 and e8 living on dierent walls (at least
the u(1) factor(s) can easily be such mixtures), see [6]. in such a case this asymmetry would
be a clear low energy signature of the double-wall structure at high energies.

9note, that we assume the convention that  varies between /2 and +/2.

5 conclusions

in this paper we have focussed on the viability of the mechanism of gaugino condensation
to generate supersymmetry breaking at acceptable energy scales in strongly coupled e8  e8
heterotic string theory. in this context we have considered compactifying the boundary theories
to d = 4 on orbifolds, in order to have explicit strongly coupled string models as the framework
to consider the 4d dynamics of the hidden sector condensation.

we have concluded that if two or three condensates are switched on dierent walls, then
supersymmetry is always broken. if a larger number of condensates are switched on, then one
obtains solutions with unbroken supersymmetry, but, possibly, stabilizing 4d moduli. from the
ve dimensional point of view, the racetracks on the walls are able to x boundary expectation
values of the 5d moduli, thus giving rise to the scenario described recently in [26].

in all the explicit examples we have studied the scale of condensation  is smaller than
the scales associated with either the 5th or orbifold compact dimensions and so justies the
treatment of the dynamics of the condensate in the 4d framework. we have seen that phe-
nomenologically reasonable values of   105mpl are obtainable in a number of models with
the mssm value of mgu t and gu t . in the case of threshold corrections which depend only
on a single t modulus, this result is particularly interesting as such a modulus is determined
in terms of mpl, mgu t and gu t by the requirement that the correct value of mpl emerge in
d = 4. thus it seems that the m-theory thresholds are such that they appear to favour mssm
values of mgu t in as much as if we try to lower signicantly the value of mgu t from this,
then  is lowered exponentially quickly, due to the sensitivity of ret to mgu t . the same
is roughly the case when several moduli are present as we have seen in the z2  z2 orbifold
examples. it would seem that to accommodate smaller values of mgu t within models that also
generate hierarchical hidden wall condensation requires some partial cancellation of moduli eld
expectation values in the threshold corrections on that wall, as we discussed above.

even though as we have stated, the magnitude of  justies a 4d renormalizable eld theory
picture, the actual supersymmetry breaking in the observable sector appears through soft terms
generated by certain 5d bulk elds that couple to the condensates. what we have seen in
some of the models studied here is that supersymmetry breaking source terms that arise from
gaugino condensation have approximately the right hierarchical mass scale to generate tev
scale supersymmetry breaking in the visible sector. to visualize some of the nontrivial features
of this supersymmetry breaking mechanism in the presence of two gauge sectors with dierent
gauge kinetic functions, we have plotted the soft susy breaking operators for elds living on
dierent walls as a function of the parameter  which controls the nonuniversal part of the
gauge kinetic function. dierent values of the  correspond to dierent embeddings. there is
a noteworthy asymmetry between soft terms on dierent walls, which might oer a low energy
signature of the double wall structure of the fundamental theory.
