abstract

we determine, to the rst order in the radius of anti-de-sitter, the real-
isation of the osp(6, 2|2) superconformal algebra on vector elds. we then
calculate, to this order, the superspace metric describing the background of
ads7  s4. the coordinates we work with are adapted to a 6+5 splitting
of the eleven dimensional superspace. finally, we deduce in a manifestly
supersymmetric form the equations governing the dynamics of the vebrane
near the boundary of ads7.

1 introduction

the relation between anti-de-sitter space (ads) and superconformal eld
theories dened on its boundary has been a subject of interest for a relatively
long time [13] ( see [4] for a review). the ads/cft conjecture [57] is the
latest proposed such relation and has, if correct, far reaching consequences:
it allows, in principle, a non-perturbative denition of string or m-theory
on ads backgrounds. the conjecture states [5], for example, that m-theory
on ads7  s4 is equivalent to a six-dimensional superconformal (2,0) eld
theory [8] dened on the boundary of ads. little is known about m-theory
besides that its low energy approximation is given by eleven-dimensional su-
pergravity, its compactication on a circle leads to type iia superstring [9]
and that it contains membranes [10] and vebranes [1115]. the worldvolume
action of super p-branes and/or their equations of motion are formulated in
a superspace background. so the study of p-branes in ads space necessitates
the determination of the superbackground. the bosonic so(6, 2)  so(5)
symmetry of ads7  s4 is promoted, when one considers the fermionic co-
ordinates in addition to the bosonic ones, to a osp(6, 2|2) superconformal
symmetry. the expression of the moving basis and the rest of the back-
ground depend on the eleven-dimensional supercoordinates one chooses to
work with or equivalently on the realisation of the isometries as super vector
elds in superspace. such a realisation was found in [1619] using the coset
approach [20]. with a particular choice of super coordinates, this approach
leads to closed expressions for the isometries of ads7  s4 as well as the
moving basis. however these coordinates are not particularly adapted to
a 6+5 splitting of eleven dimensional spacetime, the six dimensions repre-
senting the vebranes worldvolume and the ve remaining dimensions the
transverse dimensions. the aim of this paper is propose such coordinates and
use the resulting isometries and background to deduce in a manifestly super-
symmetric form the equations of motion of a vebrane near the boundary of
ads.

in order to study the super vebrane in the ads7  s4 background there
exists a privileged system of coordinates which can be seen as follows: the
vebrane super worldvolume is spanned by the (2,0) six-dimensional super-
coordinates (x, ) where  = 0, . . . 5 and  is a spin index of the (4+, 4)
spinorial representation of so(5, 1)  so(5). the transverse uctuations of
the vebrane are described by a (2,0) multiplet which comprises ve scalars
i in the vectorial representation of so(5) and a symplectic-weyl-majorana
fermion  in the (4, 4) spinorial representation of so(5, 1)  so(5). a
convenient set of super-coordinates to parametrise the eleven-dimensional
superspace is thus given by (x, i, , ). the (2,0) super poincare six-

2

dimensional group is a subgroup of osp(6, 2|2) and so it has natural real-
isation on the six-dimensional super worldvolume of the vebrane. in this
paper, we shall use these coordinates to parametrise the eleven-dimensional
superspace. this will allow us to nd, in a manifestly supersymmetric way,
the interacting (2,0) theory describing the vebrane near the boundary of
ads7. in order to do so, we determine rst the realisation of the supercon-
formal algebra on vector elds and the invariant metric.

in section 2, we briey review the ads7 metric and how it arises in eleven-
dimensional supergravity. in section 3, we determine from [21, 22] a realisa-
tion of the superconformal algebra on vector elds. this realisation does not
provide us with the killing vector elds, as we show in section 4, but will be
the zero order approximation to it. in section 5, we look for a modication of
the realisation found in section 3. we demand that the action of the super-
poincare group be not modied and we show, in section 6, that the vector
elds have an expansion in the radius, r, of ads. in this section we also
determine explicitly the rst order expansion which we use in section 7 to
construct the invariant metric. in section 8, relying on the doubly supersym-
metric formalism of the superembedding approach [11], we determine from
the invariant metric the equations governing the dynamics of the vebrane to
the rst order in r; this constitutes a good approximation near the boundary
of ads. due to our choice of coordinates, we get manifestly worldvolume su-
perconformal equations of motions. at order zero in r the equations, that is
at the boundary of ads, the equations reduce to the doubleton equations [2]
and at the next order we get interaction terms in the (2,0) theory. the equa-
tions we get are the supersymmetric version of the bosonic ones found for
radial coordinates in [5, 23] and all bosonic degrees of freedom in [24]. our
conventions and some of the technical tools are collected in appendix a; the
superconformal osp(6, 2|2) algebra is presented in appendix b.

2 ads and near horizon geometry

the d + 1 dimensional anti-de-sitter manifold is conveniently described
as the submanifold of at d + 2 dimensional at manifold with signature
(,, +,   +) embedded by the equation

 + x x  = r2,

(2.1)

where  is a d-dimensional metric with signature (, +, . . . , +) and r is
the radius of adsd+1 spacetime. the boundary of ads is obtained by con-
sidering points at innity subject to (2.1). more precisely dene the primed
coordinates by  = ,  = , and x  = x  and take the limit   

3

then the boundary is described by the surface

 + x x  = 0,

(2.2)

subject to the equivalence relation (, , x )  s(, , x ) where s is
any real non zero number. the surface (2.2) is a compactication of a d-
dimensional minkowski spacetime: when  6= 0 the coordinates x  span rd
which when added to the  = 0 part provides the compactication, s1sd2,
whose universal cover is r  sd1. convenient coordinates of ads are given
by  and x = rx /. these are well dened if  6= 0 and x remain nite
in the scaling limit   . so the boundary at  =  can be parametrised
by x. in these coordinates the ads metric takes the form

g =

2
r2 dxdx +

r2
2 dd.

(2.3)

this metric has an apparent singularity at  = 0, however as noted above,
this is merely a coordinate singularity. note that the  = 0 part of adsd+1
is given by r  adse
d1 where adse is euclidien anti-de-sitter which is
topologically a ball and its boundary is the sphere sd2. in the following,
we shall see that  has a natural interpretation as the radial distance from a
vebrane source and so the vebrane is at  = 0. note also that by a change
of coordinates    the metric becomes 22/r2dxdx + 2r2dd/2
which when  = 1/2 and 2/r2 = 2/r will be the form we shall use in the
following.

the eleven-dimensional vebrane is a solitonic solution to the eleven-
dimensional supergravity low energy equations of motion which preserves
sixteen supersymmetries. the solution is given by

gp=5 = h 1/3dxdx + h 2/3ijdij, gi1...i4 = i1...i5i5h,

(2.4)

where x.  = 0, . . . 5 are the coordinates along the vebrane and i are the
transverse coordinates. the function h entering the solution is radial and
harmonic, ijijh = 0, and so it reads

h = c +

r3
83 ,

where 2 = ijij, c is a constant and

r3 = nl3
p,

(2.5)

(2.6)

where lp is the eleven-dimensional planck length and n is the charge of the
eld strength g or the number of vebranes.

4

if one insists on having an asymptotically at eleven dimensional space-
time then one has to impose that c is not zero and one can set it equal to
one. however, another solution is to set c = 0. this does not change the
charge of the g eld strength and preserves one-half of the eleven-dimensional
supersymetries.
in the latter case, c = 0, the metric takes the form of
ads7  s4. the radial coordinate  combines with the worldvolume coordi-
nates x to form ads7. in fact in this case, the number of supersymmetries
is greater then sixteen since the six-dimensional poincare invariance of the
general (c 6= 0) case is transformed to a conformal invariance under the group
so(6, 2) which when combined with the sixteen supersymmetries gives six-
teen other special conformal supersymmetries. another way to get the ads
spacetime is to consider the decoupling limit lp  0 and /l3
p nite 4 so
that   r and one can neglect the constant c in h. it is this limit that
suggested the relation between the adsd+1 bulk theory and the worldvolume
d-dimensional eective theory [5].

more generally, the ads/cf t conjecture states that m-theory in ads7
s4 is holographically equivalent to the six-dimensional (2, 0) theory at the
boundary of ads [7]. in the following, we shall show that it is possible to
determine as an expansion in r3/ the metric and isometries of the super-
background whose bosonic limit is ads7  s4. we shall calculate explicitly
the rst order terms which give the correction to the free dynamics of the
vebrane near the (part of the) boundary at  = .

3 a realisation of osp(6, 2|2) on vector elds

in this section we determine, from the free six-dimensional (2,0) multiplet, a
realisation of osp(6, 2|2) on eleven-dimensional spacetime.
the six-dimensional (2,0) superspace is spanned by the coordinates (x, )
where  = 0, . . . 5 and  is a spinorial index in the (4+, 4) of so(5, 1)so(5),
so(5) being the r-symmetry group. the at superconformal transforma-
tions are dened as in ref. [21] by the requirement that the at six-dimensional
supersymmetric metric

g = e  e,

where e = dx  d, transforms by a scale factor, that is

g = lg = g,

(3.1)

(3.2)

4this guarantees that the tension of the string obtained from the open membrane

stretched between the origin and  is nite

5

where  is the scale factor. the realisation of the transformations in super-
space was determined and is given by  = e + e. here, e =  and
e = d =   () are the supersymmetric basis of vectors. the
components of  are determined in terms of  ,   and ij which are dened
by

 = a + a[]x + x + (x2  2xx)k,

and

  =  + x()

(3.3)

(3.4)

the parameters a, a, , k, ij,   and  are those of innitesimal
translations, lorentz transformations, dilatation, special conformal transfor-
mations, rotations, supersymmetries and fermionic special conformal trans-
formations. the six-dimensional super killing vector elds are given by [21]

the (2,0) on-shell multiplet is described by a supereld i in the vectorial
representation of so(5) subject to the constraint [25]

di =

(3.9)

it has been shown in [21] that (3.9) is invariant under the superconformal
group provided the scalar supereld i transforms as

(3.10)

where

ij() = 4ij

(3.11)

from (3.10) and (3.11) we get

0 = 0() + ,

(3.12)

where 2 = ii. the fermionic supereld whose  = 0 component,  is
the superpartner of i, the  = 0 component of i, is  = 1/5idi. under
a superconformal transformation, it transforms as

 = () +  + jjd + d,

(3.13)

where d denotes the matrix d. we can construct a realisation of the su-
perconformal group in eleven-dimensional superspace as follows. we consider
x = (x, i) to be the even coordinates and   = (, ) to be the odd
coordinates. the two spinors of so(5, 1)so(5) of opposite six-dimensional
chirality combine to form one majorana spinor of so(10, 1). the vector elds

0 = 

0  + 

0 d  i

jji (cid:16)( + jjd + d)(cid:17)

,

(3.14)

where i = /i and  = /, provide a realisation of the superconfor-
mal algebra on eleven dimensional superspace. note that i and  are no
longer elds but become coordinates in the eleven-dimensional superspace.

4 modied bosonic realisation

in this section, we show that the realisation found in the previous section
does not provide us with the super killing vectors of ads7  s4. in order
to see that, it suces to examine the bosonic part of the metric and the
transformations.

the bosonic metric of ads7  s4 is given by

g =

2
r

dxdx +

r2
42 ijdidj,

(4.1)

7

where 2 = ii. this metric is not invariant under the transformations
generated by the bosonic part of 0 constructed above. in fact we have

and

0(dxdx) = dxdx

0 = ,

(4.2)

(4.3)

so the rst piece of the metric is invariant. however the second part is not
invariant and its variation is given by

0(cid:18) r2

42 ijdidj(cid:19) =

r2

42 i(cid:0)ddj + djd(cid:1) ij

(4.4)

this variation can be cancelled by modifying the transformation of x by

x = 0x +

r3
8

.

(4.5)

the modied transformations, as will be seen in the next section, still close
on the superconformal algebra. in order to extend the bosonic metric to the
superconformal case we have to modify the realisation found in the previous
section of the superconformal algebra on eleven dimensional superspace. this
will be the goal of the next section.

5 modied superconformal realisations

let g be an element of the superconformal algebra which is presented in
appendix b, the vector eld which gives a realisation of osp(6, 2|2) must
verify

[(g), (g)] = ([g, g]),

(5.1)

in terms of the generators, (g) is of the form

 = ap + q +

1
2

am +

1
2

ijjij + kk + 

s + d,

(5.2)

we write  as 0 + , where 0 is the previously determined solution to the
closure relations. so  must be a solution of

[(g), 0(g)] + [0(g), (g)] + [(g), (g)] = ([g, g]).

(5.3)

8

we require that (x, ) span the six-dimensional superspace so that

translations and supersymmetric transformations are unchanged

p = q = 0,

(5.4)

and we also require that the lorentz and r-group so(5) realisations be
unchanged

the weights of the dierent coordinates remain the same so

m = jij = 0.

d = 0.

(5.5)

(5.6)

so the modication concerns only k  x and s  x. these have to
obey the following constraints which are the closure relations (5.1) expressed
in terms of the generators

[p, x] = 0,
[x, q] = ()

[p, x] = 0,
{x, q} = 0,
[x, k] + [k, x] + [x, x] = 0,
[x, s] + [s, x] + {x, x} = 2()x.

x,

(5.7)

the other commutation relations give the lorentz, so(5) and dilatation
transformations of x and x. the rst two equations imply that the com-
ponents of x and x are independent of x in the (, d, i, ) basis.
similarly the next two equations imply that the components of x are inde-
pendent of  and that those of x are of the form

x = y +  ()

x,

(5.8)

where the components of y are independent of . the last equation turns
out, after the use of jacobi identities, to be a consequence of the fth relation.
finally we end with the equation

[x, k] + [k, x] + [x, x] = 0,

(5.9)

where the components of x are independent of x and depend linearly on 
as in equation (5.8).

let us examine rst the bosonic case, where  and  are absent. the
most general form of x whose components are independent of x and have
the correct transformations under so(5, 1), so(5) and dilatations is given
by

x (b)

 = a

1


,

9

(5.10)

where a is a constant. note that there are no components on i because there
are no lorentz vectors independent of x. this x satises [x, x] = 0 and
a non-trivial calculation gives, for any value of a,

[x (b)

 , k] + [k, x (b)

 ] = 0.

(5.11)

so in the bosonic case we have a one parameter deformation of the realisation
of the conformal lie algebra on space-time.

in the supersymmetric case, the most general expression for x is much
more complicated, it has an expansion in powers of  which a priori stops at
sixteen s. however, this power series in  is correlated, as will be shown in
the next section, with the dependence on r and . this will help simplifying
the resulting expressions.

6 expansion in r

dene i by i = r3i then the bosonic metric, expressed in the new
coordinates, when divided by r2 does not depend on r. from the expression
of 0, we deduce that if we dene  = r3 then 0, when expressed in terms
of the primed quantities is independent of r. since the bosonic metric has
only an overall scale dependence on r the full , which are the killing vectors
of the full superconformal metric, are independent of r when expressed in
terms of the primed quantities.

let us rst consider y, it has an expansion in  of the form

y =xn   y

(n)()
1+5n/4  +

y

3/4+5n/4 d
yi

! ,

(6.1)

where the ym
(n)() are homogeneous polynomials in  of degree n. the
powers of  in the denominators are determined from the behaviour under
dilatations. when expressed in terms of unprimed quantities we get

y =xn  r4+n

y

3/4+5n/4 ! ,

(6.2)

10

where r = r3/4. lorentz invariance constrains the degrees of polynomi-
als appearing in (6.2). for example, all terms quadratic in  are of the
form 123, ij, 123i, so they all have an odd number of six-
dimensional vector indices and thus cannot contribute to y 
 . using this kind
of arguments one can show that if a polynomial of degree n contributes to
one component then the other polynomials appearing in the component have
degrees n + 4p. the lowest degree polynomials appearing in each component
are given by

5 ,

where ai, i = 1, . . . , 8 are arbitrary constants. we have used fierz rearrange-
ments to eliminate some of the terms with three powers of  (see appendix
a). note that the leading power of r in (6.2) for all the components is r4;
from (6.2) and (6.3) we see that the general form of y is given by

y =

(6.5)

similarly, one can make an analogous analysis for x. here, the lowest degree

11

polynomial contributing to x are given by

x
(1) = b1()

x
(2) = b3(ij)

(6.6)

the corresponding expansion in r follows with the dierence with respect to
y that the last term in (6.6) contributes at order zero and the contribution
to the rst order comes from terms with four s. we deduce that x and
x have an expansion of the form

x =

4

xp=1

r4px (p)

 , x =

4

xp=1

r4px (p)
 ,

(6.7)

and the closure relation gives

[k, x (p)

 ] + [x (p)

 , k] = xq+q=p

[x (q)

 , x (q)
 ].

(6.8)

since k has an x and  dependence, each component of the equation above
gives upon identication of terms dependent on x and  a series of equations
which consistency is not guaranteed a priori. to the lowest order, equation
(6.8) yields the linear equation

[k, x (1)

 ] + [x (1)

 , k] = 0,

(6.9)



 = y (1)

 + x (1), with the components of y (1)

where x (1)
given in (6.3) and
those of x (1)
 given in (6.6). the detailed analysis of the equations is long but
straightforward. the number of equations is much greater than the number
of coecients. we have checked the compatibility of all the equations. some
of the resulting equations are homogeneous and are identically satised, if
we set a1 6= 0, then the inhomogeneous equations allow the determination of
the other coecients in terms of a1. we obtain the following results for the
coecients in y :

a3 = a5 = a6 = a7 = 0
a1 = 4a2 = 8a4 = 32a8

(6.10)

and for x

7 invariant metric

in this section we shall use the killing vector elds determined in the pre-
ceding section to deduce the invariant metric. we write the metric in the
form

g =

2
r

 e  e +

r2
42 ij ei  ej.

(7.1)

taking into account the behaviour under translation, supersymmetry, dilata-
tions, rotation and lorentz transformations as well as a z2 symmetry acting
as i  i and   , we get, to order r4 the following expression for
e

e = e + r4(cid:18)c1

(7.2)

the terms in c3, c4, c5 and c6 are redundant since, by fierz rearrangements
they can be cast into the form of already present terms (see appendix a);
so we can set these coecients to zero. similarly, we get for ei, to the order
zero

ei = di + d1( id) + d2( ijd)

(7.3)

the coecients ci and di are determined by the requirement of invariance
of the metric under conformal and special conformal transformations which

13

were determined in the preceding section. the metric can be decomposed as
a term of order zero and a term of order one

the equations governing the invariance of the metric give at order zero

l0g0 = 0,

(7.4)

(7.5)

(7.6)

(7.7)

which is satised by the construction of 0 presented in section 3. at the
next order we get

lg0 + l0g1 = 0.

8 interaction in the six-dimensional (2,0) the-

ory

in this section we derive the equations governing a vebrane in the ads7s4
background to the rst order in r4. this will give the rst order interaction
terms in the (2,0) theory. we shall use the superembedding approach [11]
which is particularly convenient for our purposes. this approach is man-
ifestly worldvolume and target space supersymmetric.
it has been shown
that, by xing the worldvolume coordinates, it leads to the manifestly tar-
get space supersymmetric greenschwarz equations for p-branes [11]. here,
we shall choose to work in the physical gauge which leads to manifestly
worldvolume supersymmetric equations in terms of the superelds i and 
which appeared in the free (2,0) theory reviewed in section 3.

in the physical gauge, the super worldvolume of the vebrane is spanned
by the (x, ) coordinates. the dynamics is described by the superelds
i(x, ) and (x, ). let e be a basis of odd vector elds on the world-
volume. and let e be the pull-back of the eleven-dimensional even moving
basis:

e = e 

d + e 

 dx + e 

i d(x, )i + e 

d

(x, ),

(8.1)

where d is the six-dimensional exterior derivative (d = dx + d). the
equations governing the dynamics of the vebrane are simply

e(e) = 0.

(8.2)

these are equivalent to the equations obtained from the superembedding
approach. the most general odd vector eld on the worlvolume reads

e = 

d + 

.

(8.3)

thanks to the linearity property of (8.2), it is possible to normalise the e
such that e(d) = 

, and e can be cast in the form

(8.4)
 is determined from (8.2) as well as the equation relating i to

e = d + 

.

the eleven dimensional superalgebra reads

{q , q } = 2(c)  p,

(a.1)

where  = 1, . . . , 32,  = 0, . . . 10 and c   is an antisymmetric matrix
verifying

the reality condition on 11d fermions reads

c 1c = t .

or equivalently

 = c t ,

  = c      ,

(a.2)

(a.3)

(a.4)

where c   is the inverse of c  . we shall use c to raise and lower indices
and the notation ()   for (c)  .

we are interested in the 6 + 5 splitting the eleven dimensional spacetime.

a representation of the gamma matrices is conveniently given by

 =   1, 5+i =   i,

(a.5)

where  and i are respectively six and ve dimensional vector indices, and 
is the chirality matrix in six dimensions:

 = 0 . . . 5.

(a.6)

this matrix allows to decompose 11d majorana fermions into two 6d sp(2)
symplectic majorana weyl fermions:   = (, ). we shall also denote
5+i by i. in this representation the charge conjugaison matrix c may be
written as

c = c  ,

(a.7)

where c is symmetric and veries

whereas  is antisymmetric and veries

c 1c =  t ,

1i = i t .

(a.9)

the antisymmetrised product of n gamma matrices is denoted by 1...n.

we have

(1...nc)t = (1)n(n+1)/21...nc.

a useful relation is the fierz rearrangement formula which reads for four
