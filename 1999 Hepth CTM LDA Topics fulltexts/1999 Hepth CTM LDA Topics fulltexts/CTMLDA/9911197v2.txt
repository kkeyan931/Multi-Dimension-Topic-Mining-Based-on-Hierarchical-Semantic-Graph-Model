on the flattening of negative curvature via t-duality with

a non-constant b-field

abstract

in an earlier paper, alvarez, alvarez-gaume, barbon and lozano pointed out,
that the only way to atten negative curvature by means of a t-duality is by
introducing an appropriate, non-constant ns-ns b 2-form. in this paper, we are
investigating this further and ask, whether it is possible to t-dualize adsd space
to at space with some suitably chosen b. to answer this question, we derive
a relationship between the original curvature tensor and the one of the t-dualized
metric involving the b-eld. it turns out that there is one particular component,
which is independent of b . by inspection of this component, we then show, that
it is not possible to dualize adsd to at space irrespective of the choice of b.
finally, we examine the extension of ads to an ads5  s5 geometry and propose
a chain of s- and t-dualities together with an sl(2, z) coordinate transformation,
leading to a dual d9-brane geometry.

by now the ads-cft conjecture [1, 2, 3] has passed an enormous amount of tests (see
[4] for a review). most of them explored the large n duality between the boundary-cft
and the supergravity on ads5. the common radius of the s5 and the length-scale of the
ads5, r, is given by r4 = ()2, with  = g2
y m n representing the t hooft coupling. in
general supergravity as the low-energy limit of string-theory is trustworthy only at large
scales, i.e. small curvatures. thus tests of the duality probing the supergravity regime
explore the    parameter region. this predicts how the cft at large n behaves in
the extreme non-perturbative regime.
the interesting parameter regime, interpolating between the perturbative   0 and
the extreme non-perturbative    regime, demands that we keep  nite. since the
closed string coupling constant gs and the yang-mills coupling constant are related via
g2
y m = 4gs, the large n limit with  nite, requires gs  0. thus via the ads-cft
conjecture, we are able to extract the full quantum information about the cft in the large
n limit by calculating simply iib string tree-diagrams. unfortunately, this wonderful
perspective is obstructed by the fact, that iib string-theory in the rns-formulation on
an ads5  s5 background with n units of rr 5-form ux through the s5 is still obscure
(see [5] for an approach). on the other hand there are proposals for a gs-formulation [6]
which is non-linear and therefore its quantization and computation of string scattering
amplitudes seems to be dicult.

since string-theory on an ads5  s5 background is not readily available, one may
seek resort to a dual description of iib string-theory on a, hopefully, easier background.
as a rst step into this direction, we want to analyze in this paper, whether pure adsd
space can be dualized to at minkowski space. the motivation for this problem stems
from the observation, made in [7], that the only way to atten negative curvature under
t-duality is by introducing an appropriate torsion, generated by b, in the initial space-
time. this can be seen from the following formula2, relating the dual curvature scalar r
to the initial curvature scalar [7]

r = r + 4  ln k +

here a = k/k2, k = g with the associated eld-strength f = a  a.
furthermore,  ln k = 1g (cid:0)gg ln k(cid:1) denotes the dalembertian with respect to
the initial metric. as usual, the torsion 3-form is the eld strength3 h = db of the ns-
ns 2-form b. the killing vector, corresponding to the assumed translational isometry
exhibited by the initial space-time, is given by k and its norm dened by k = pgkk.
one could now try to solve (1) for r =  and r = 0, with  a positive constant. but
this would include any solution of the vacuum einstein equations. to decide whether we

arrive at at space after t-dualization, we have to regard the riemann curvature tensor.
let us start quite generally by assuming some coordinate representation of a d-
dimensional manifold, given by4 x = (x0, x1, . . . , xd2, xd1) = (x, x) ;  = 0, . . . , d 2.
furthermore, the initial metric is supposed to be of the form

ds2 = gdxdx + gdxdx .

we observe, that our choice of g = 0 cannot be compensated by an appropriate choice of
some real-valued b (only an imaginary would suce). the reason why we set neverthe-
less g = 0, from the outset, is the following. according to (1), a non-vanishing g = k
tends to make the curvature scalar of the dual metric more negative. since we start with
a negatively curved adsd and aim to bring it to at space, a k 6= 0 would obstruct our
intention.
we assume that the metric g(x) and the ns-ns 2-form b(x) do not depend on
x. these conditions are exactly those, which are required in order to leave the -model
action

s =

2 z d2z (g + b) x  x 

invariant under innitesimal shifts x  x + k. the killing vector associated with the
resulting abelian translational isometry, is k = /x, with k = (k, k) = (0, . . . , 1).
with the resulting norm k = g of the killing vector, a more convenient expression
for the metric (2) in view of our later application, is given in terms of an anholonomic
vielbein co-base by

ds2 = abeaeb + eiei = mnemen ,

where the chosen anholonomic vielbein el = (ea, ei) reads

ea = ea

ei = ei

locally, this is solved by w = ikb  v with dv = ikh for some 1-form v. under ik we
understand the interior product. from now on, we will choose the gauge w = 0, which
leads us, together with the identity (ikb) = kb = b, to

the strategy of the calculation of the dual riemann-tensor will now be as follows.
with the aid of cartans structure equations, we determine the curvature tensor and its
t-dual in the el = {ea, ei}, resp. t-dual el = {ea, ei} co-base. in order to compare both
of them, it is further necessary to switch to the equivalent expressions in the common
holonomic co-base dx = (dx, dx) with the help of the afore mentioned vielbeins.

therefore, let us begin with (3) and avail ourselves of cartans rst structure equation

as an application of these general formulas, we now want to verify, if d-dimensional
adsd space can be t-dualized to at space under the inclusion of some suitably chosen
b. both spaces, regarded as string backgrounds, leave all supersymmetries intact. we
choose the following coordinate representation for adsd

ds2 =

r2

l2(cid:18)  dt2 +

d2

xj=1

dyjdyj(cid:19) + l2 dr2
r2 ,

(14)

with l being the ads-radius. it exhibits a negative, constant curvature scalar r = d(d
1)/l2. for the isometry direction we choose one of the yj coordinates, e.g. yd2. in our
above convention, the adapted coordinates are x0 = t, x1 = y1, . . . , xd3 = yd3, xd2 =
r, xd1  x = yd2. the curvature tensor of the negatively curved, maximally symmetric
adsd is given by r =  1
l2 (gg  gg), which reduces in our parameterization
to6

r4
l6  ,

rrr = 

r = 

,  6= r
and all other components vanishing. in particular, this gives r =  r4
l6 
l2(cid:1)r
r
. now, the important observation is, that there is a single equation, (13), for the
dual curvature-tensor, which is independent of v, resp. b and hence allows answering
our question. plugging in the actual norm of the killing vector k = r/l for the above adsd
metric, we obtain for the right-hand side of (13) the expression 1
l2 (cid:0) 1
r4(cid:1)r
r
. ob-
viously, this does not fulll the requirement r = 0 for at space and is not even asymp-
totically at. the tensor transformation property r (x) = (a
  r(x),
a
 = x/x, then guarantees that this term is also non-vanishing for any other
with a
coordinate parameterization of adsd. thus at space cannot be reached from pure adsd

via t-duality plus the inclusion of some appropriately chosen b. the general formulae
(11)-(13) can serve as a starting point for more involved t-dualities, including a non-
trivial b, of adsd or the more important ads5  s5 extension to other spaces.
eventually, we turn briey to the important ads5  s5 extension of ads. here it
seems possible to relate the iib d9-brane geometry, which describes d=10 space itself,
to the ads5  s5 geometry. in order to do so, one has to start with a six-fold t-duality,
transforming the d9-brane to the d3-brane. then, dualizing a iib d3-brane to its own
near-horizon geometry, one reaches ads5  s5. this can be done following the work of
[9]. starting with the d3-brane geometry in string-frame

and performing a t-duality over x3, x2 brings us to the iib d1-brane. a further s-duality
transformation yields the fundamental iib string solution

the crucial step to get rid of the constant in the harmonic h8 function, consists of perform-
ing rst an sl(2, r) coordinate transformation on the coordinates t, x1 and subsequently
a t-duality transformation in the new x1 direction. provided that we choose the special
sl(2, r) coordinate transformation

t =

1

2 (cid:0)t + x1(cid:1) ,

x1 = 2x1 ,

(20)

we are guaranteed that the transformation is globally well-dened on (t, x1) space, which
has the toplogy of a cylinder due to the compactication of x1. after t-duality in x1

it is important to note that the last t-duality has again been along a space-like direc-
tion. therefore we are secured to stay in the type ii string-theory framework instead of
changing to type ii* [10].

now, proceeding in the inverse manner, a second s-duality promotes us to a modied
d1-brane. ultimately, with two t-dualities in the x2, x3 directions we end up with a
modied d3-brane solution without a constant part in its harmonic function. as is well-
known, this gives the ads5  s5 geometry. notice, however, that the d3-brane solution is
only locally dual to the ads5  s5 solution. in order to perform the various t-dualities,
the brane has to be wrapped on a torus with all worldvolume coordinates taken to be
periodic. therefore the coordinates of the nal ads5 s5 geometry in addition have to be
identied globally. as mentioned in [9] this has the eect that only half the killing spinors
of ads5 remain. thus, only locally we have a maximally supersymmetric ads5  s5 solu-
tion. globally, the d3-brane as well as the dual solution break half the supersymmetry.
a word of caution is in order. the spacetime-lling d9-brane is supposed to describe
at ten-dimensional minkowski spacetime [11]. however, the d9-brane breaks half the
supersymmetry, whereas at space does not. the resolution to this puzzle comes from the
well-known fact, that the open-string sector of n d9-branes is only consistent, if we have
n = 32 of them and perform an orientifolding by the world-sheet parity  :     .
this breaks half the supersymmetry and the resulting type i so(32) theory gives us in
addition to the at ten-dimensional minkowski solution a spacetime-lling o9 orientifold
xed plane. the inclusion of these xed planes is under current investigation.
