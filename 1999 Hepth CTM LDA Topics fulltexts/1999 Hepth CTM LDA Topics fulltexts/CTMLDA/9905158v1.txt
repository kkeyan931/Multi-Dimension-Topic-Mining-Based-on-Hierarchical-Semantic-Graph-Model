energy levels of interacting fields in a box

j. a. espichan carrillo,1 and a. maia jr.2

we study the inuence of boundary conditions on energy levels of interacting elds
in a box and discuss some consequences when we change the size of the box. in
order to do this we calculate the energy levels of bound states of a scalar massive
eld  interacting with another scalar eld  through the lagrangian lint = 3
2 g22
in an one-dimensional box, on which we impose dirichlet boundary conditions. we
have found that the gap between the bound states changes with the size of the box
in a non-trivial way. for the case the masses of the two elds are equal and for
large box the energy levels of dashen-hasslacher-neveu (dhn model) (dashen et
al, 1974) are recovered and we have a kind of boson condensate for the ground state.
below to a critical box size l  2.93 22
m the ground state level splits, which we
interpret as particle-antiparticle production under small perturbations of box size.
below another critical sizes (l  6
m ) of the box, the ground
state and rst excited state merge in the continuum part of the spectrum.

in eq.(2) we have neglected the term 3 g2 which can be interpreted as the back-reaction

of eld  on the mass term of . this can be achieved if we impose that || << min{ m
of course other regimes can be studied from eq. (2) adopting dierent approximations.

it is well known the static solutions of the classical equation of motion (2) are given by

(dashen et al, 1974)

(x) =

tanh(

).

these are kink solutions which connect two vacua at x = . in this work unlike , the
eld  is not changed by boundary conditions. so in our approximation they are transparent

to . in a future work we will consider the most general case.

substituting these solutions in eq.(1) we obtain

since we are interested in stationary solutions, we can write (x) = ei t(x), where  are

this equation is similar to that one from dhn model (dashen et al, 1974), which describe

kinks in (1 + 1) dimensions, but here two dierent mass parameters appear in the potential.

in the section 2, we calculate the bounded energy levels of the eld  (or ) constrained

to a box in (1 + 1) dimension with dirichlet boundary conditions. we discuss how we can

interpret the splitting of the ground state when the box is shortened below a critical value, as

particle production from a vacuum condensate.

2. bounded spectrum

in this section we obtain the energy levels of eld  imposing dirichlet boundary conditions.

this is as follows. with the changing of variables z = mx

(6)

in this work, we discuss the particular case g = . the general case, including an asymptotic

study for weak and strong coupling constant g will be presented elsewhere. nevertheless the

above condition leads to interesting results. firstly it is possible to turn this equation into a

hypergeometric dierential equation. this is as follows:

1.- we impose the term dependent on the variable z in square brackets, equal to zero, which

gives a relation between k and e, i.e.,

k = 6  e.

2.- making a changing of the independent variable, namely,

 =

1

(1  tanh(z))

we obtain a hypergeometrical dierential equation

(9)

this equation has regular singular points at  = 0,  = 1 and  = , and parameters
a = k + 3, b = k  2 and c = k + 1. the two independent analytic solutions are given by
(gradshteyn and ryzhik, 1980):

y1() = 2f1(k + 3, k  2; k + 1; ),

y2() = k

2f1(2, 3; 1  k; ).

3

(10)

(11)

as it is well known, if the parameter c is a positive integer a solution of the equation (9) will

be y1() and, if c is a negative integer, it will be given by y2(). also there are other solutions
containing a logarithmic term (fuchs theorem). if c is a non-integer number, the set of two

solutions y1() and y2() is a system of linearly independent solutions (butkov, 1968). next
we study these three dierent cases for c. from now on, in order to simplify the notation, we

denote the hypergeometric function 2f1 simply as f .

case i: c is a positive integer.

in this case, c = k + 1 = n, where n = 1, 2, 3, . . ., and by fuchs theorem (butkov, 1968),

the general solution is given by

y () = ay1() + by1() ln |  | +b



xs=0

as(k)sk,

where a and b are arbitrary constants.

it is easy to see that this solution has a logarithmic divergence at  = 0. since we want

the solution y () be bounded, we must take b = 0. this comes from the constraint that for a
large box (l  ) we must recover dhns kink and its bounded energy levels. so the solution
reduces to

y () = a f (n + 2, n  3; n; ),

where k was substituted by n  1.

using the relations (5) and (7), as well changing of variable z = mx

2 in the above expression,

we obtain

(x) = a sech(n1)(

1
2{1  tanh(
below, in order to simplify the notation, we will denote m as m.
now we impose dirichlet boundary conditions at x =  l

) f (n + 2, n  3; n;

)}).

(12)

2 for the solution (12), that is

l
2

(

) = a sech(n1)(

m l
22

) f (n + 2, n  3; n;

1
2{1  tanh(

m l
22

)}) = 0.

from these relations we get the condition

f (n + 2, n  3; n;

1
2{1  tanh(

m l
22

)}) = 0.

(13)

on the other hand, since 2  e < 6, from equation (7), we can show that the parameter

k satises the inequalities

q6(1  ) < k  q6  2

or

q6  2  k < q6(1  ).

4

since we have considered that k  r, then from the above relations we obtain   1.
so, the possible values of parameter k are in the intervals 0 < k  6  2, 44 or 2, 44 
6  k < 0. as in this case c is a positive integer, we must take the interval 0 < k  6.
the allowed integer values of k in the interval 0 < k  6 and the correspondent values of

e (from eq.(13)) are (using the relation k = n  1)

for

n = 2,

k = 1

then e = 5,

for

n = 3,

k = 2

then e = 2.

(14)

the hypergeometric function in (13) can be written as jacobi polinomials (abramowitz and

stegun, 1972) and it is not dicult to prove that substituting the allowed values of k (14) into

(13) we do not get any consistent solution.

case ii: c is a negative integer.

now we consider c = k + 1 = n, where n = 1, 2, 3, . . ., and then we must consider the
interval 6  k < 0. the solution of the hypergeometric equation, in this case, is given by

y2(). as for the previous case, by fuchs theorem, we have that the general solution is given
by

y () = a y2() + b y2() ln |  | +b



xs=0

as(k)sk,

where a and b are arbitrary constants.

in this case we can not discard the b-terms in the same way as in the previous case, since
for   0 we have k ln   0 and s k > 0 for s = 0, 1, 2,   . so we dont have a singularity
at  = 0. nevertheless, we notice that the relation y ()
y2() is divergent in the asymptotic limit of
 = 0, i.e.

y ()
y2()  .

lim
0

again, we can impose our natural boundary condition, that is, for very large box (l  ),
the dhn solution (dashen et al, 1974) should be recovered. in order to do this, we must impose

the following asymptotic condition

y ()
y2()  1.

lim
0

in order to this condition be valid, the coecient b must vanish. therefore, our solution

reduces to

y () = a (n+1) f (2, 3; 2 + n; ),

5

where k was substituted by (n + 1), and a 6= 0.

as we did before, using the relations (5) and (7), as well the changing of variable z = m x
2

in the above expression, we can write the solution in the original variables:

(x) = a sech(n+1)(

m x
2

){1  tanh( m x
2(n+1)

2 )}(n+1)

f (2, 3; 2 + n;

1
2{1  tanh(

m x
2

)}).

(15)

now, imposing dirichlet boundary conditions at x =  l
l
2

){1  tanh( m l
2(n+1)

) = a sech(n+1)(

2 )}(n+1)

m l
22

(

2 , namely

f (2, 3; 2 + n;

1
2{1  tanh(

m l
22

)}) = 0,

we obtain the condition

f (2, 3; 2 + n;

1
2{1  tanh(

m l
22

)}) = 0.

(16)

in this case, the allowed integer values of k, in the interval 6  k < 0 are using the

relation k = (n + 1) given by

for

n = 0,

for

n = 1,

k = 1

k = 2

then

e = 5,

then

e = 2.

(17)

as in the previous case it is not dicult to write the above hypergeometric function (16) as

jacobi polinomials (abramowitz and stegun, 1972). a quick analysis shows that no consistent
solution exists for nite l 6= 0. for l = , the dhns case (n = 0) is obtained.

case iii: c is a non integer.

since c is a non-integer number (positive or negative), the general solution is given by

y () = a f (k + 3, k  2; k + 1; ) + b ()k f (2, 3; 1  k; ).

(18)

now we repeat the previous steps, i.e., using the relations (5) and (7), as well the change

of variable z = m x

2 in the previous expression, and obtain
) a f (k + 3, k  2; k + 1;

m x
2

(x) = sechk(

1
2{1  tanh(

m x
2

)}) +

b 2k[1  tanh(

m x
2

)]k f (2, 3; 1  k;

1
2{1  tanh(

m x
2

)})! .

(19)

6

now must determine k and, afterwards, using relation (7), nd the allowed values of e.

the dirichlet boundary conditions at x =  l

l
2

(

) = sechk(

m l
22

2 are given by
) a f (k + 3, k  2; k + 1;

1
2{1  tanh(

m l
22

)}) +

b 2k[1  tanh(

m l
22

)]k f (2, 3; 1  k;

1
2{1  tanh(

m l
22

)})! = 0.

from these relations we obtain

a f (k + 3, k  2; k + 1;

1
2{1  tanh(

m l
22

)}) +

b 2k[1  tanh(

m l
22

)]k f (2, 3; 1  k;

1
2{1  tanh(

m l
22

)}) = 0.

this is a system of homogeneous equations for a and b. so this system has a non-trivial

solution only if the determinant of system is zero, i.e.,

{1  tanh(

m l
22

)}k f (k + 3, k  2; k + 1;

1
2{1 + tanh(

m l
22

)})

f (2, 3; 1  k;

1
2{1  tanh(

m l
22

)})  {1 + tanh(

m l
22

)}k

f (k + 3, k  2; k + 1;

1
2{1  tanh(

m l
22

)}) f (2, 3; 1  k;

1
2{1 + tanh(

m l
22

)}) = 0.

(20)

again we can write the above hypergeometric functions as jacobi polinomials (abramowitz

and stegun, 1972). in this way, from (20) we obtain a transcendental equation for the parameter

k, i.e.,




)

22)
1 + tanh( m l
22

1  tanh( m l

k

= 


) + 3 tanh2( m l
k2  1 + 3 k tanh( m l
22
22
22) + 3 tanh2( m l
k2  1  3 k tanh( m l

)

22)
 .

(21)

notice that substituting k by k in equation (21), it can be veried that this equation
is satised. so these solutions are valid in the intervals (0, 1)  (1, 2)  (2,6)  r and
(6,2)  (2,1)  (1, 0)  r. observe that for the negative sign, k = 1 is a solution
of equation (21), but it is not allowed since now we are considering k 6 z.

an analytic solution for the transcendental equation (21) was not founded but it is possible

to obtain numerical solutions for it as we can see in the gure below for the case that  = 1.

fig. 1. shifts of bound states with the size of the box. here  = 1. the
horizontal lines show the asymptotic values of the dhn model (dashen
et al, 1974).

the fig. 1 shows the relation between parameter k and the size l of the box. observe

that both ground state and the rst excited state shift with the size of the box. starting

with a very large box size l, as it decreases, the values of 0 and 1 increases from 0 = 0
(k = 2 and l  ) to 0 = 2m (k = 0), and from 1 = q 3
2 m (k = 1, and l  )
to 1 = 2m (k = 0). close to critical value  0.6 for 0, and  1.71 for 1 these bound
states merge in the continuum part of the spectrum (k = 0). on the other hand, for l  
the values of 0 and 1 decreases until to reach their minimum values 0 = 0 and 1 = q 3
2 m
respectively, just as in the dhn model. this behaviour happens for both cases of positive and

negative signs in the equation (21) with negative k. for any positive k and large box sizes l

the equation (21) has no solution, which can be checked analitically (see also the fig.1 above).
so we discard positive values of k since for a large box (l  ) they do not lead to dhns
energy levels.

we can also obtain a relation between (l)

m and box size l. from equation (7) and the

fig. 2. energy levels of the ground state of eld  (or ) dependent of
the box size l. the horizontal lines show the asymptotic values of dhn
model (dashen et al, 1974).

now we can see that for the rst case ( = 1), the ground state 0, for large box size may
form an aproximated vacuum particle-antiparticle condensate, since both levels are exponen-
tially close one from another. roughly speaking below a critical size ( 2.93) any perturbation
of box size will induce pair formation from this energy level. this could be important for

particle production in the presence of strong elds. squeezed elds could have an enhanced

production.

another interesting behaviour of the energy levels is showed in fig. 3 below. we plotted

the dierence between the levels 0 and 1, for arbitrary distance l. the interesting fact about
this is the peak around the critical value m l
22  2.93 and that the increasing part of the curve
(left-hand side) from the peak shows a not smooth, growth with several secondary maxima and

minima.

3. conclusions

in this work we calculated the solutions of a klein-gordon type equation in an one-dimensional

box for which we impose dirichlet boundary conditions, and in the presence of a kink-type

potential generated by a second scalar, self-interacting eld which, in our approximation, is not

subjected to the boundary conditions. energy levels of bounded states for non-trivial solutions

are obtained as roots of a transcendental equation involving l and k. although we have not

obtained analytic solutions to it, we have studied numerical solutions (see fig. 1).

the ground state 0 and the rst excited state 1 shifts with the size l of the box (see g.
1), for both cases of positive and negative signs. as the size l of the box decreases, 0 increases

2 m,2m]. close to the critical value  0.6 for 0, and
in the interval [0,2m], and 1 in [q 3
 1.71 for 1, all the bounded states merge in the continuum part of the spectrum. for large
distances (l = ) we obtain the energy levels of dhn model. the decrease of l induces shifts
on the bound states levels of the system, and close to a critical size  2.93 we have just barely
bound condensate (morse and feshbach, 1953) that may decay against a small perturbation

on the system, with particle pair creation (fig. 2).

the gap between the two bound states presents a peak at m l

22  2.93 and shows a wildly
(non-smooth) behaviour. it is interesting that the critical value for the splitting of the levels

10

coincide with the value to the peak position, but we do not have any explanation for this fact

up to now. this, as well the study of the system taking into account nite boundary conditions

to both elds  and  will be done elsewhere.
