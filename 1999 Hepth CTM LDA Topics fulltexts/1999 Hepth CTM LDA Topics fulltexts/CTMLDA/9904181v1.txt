abstract

we study various three-dimensional supersymmetric maxwell chern-simons solitons by using
type iib brane congurations. we give a systematic classication of soliton spectra such as
topological bps vortices and nontopological vortices in n = 2, 3 supersymmetric maxwell
chern-simons system via the branes of type iib string theory. we identify the brane congu-
rations with the soliton spectra of the eld theory and obtain a nice agreement with eld theory
aspects. we also discuss possible brane constructions for bps domain wall solutions.

1 introduction

the recent developments in non-perturbative string theories have provided new powerful tools
to understand the supersymmetric gauge theories [1]. the low-energy dynamics of the d-
branes is described by the supersymmetric gauge theories which can be related to the ground-
state excitations of fundamental strings connecting pairs of d-branes [2]. the bps brane
congurations in the background led to many exact results on the vacuum structure of the
supersymmetric gauge theories.

novel aspects of three-dimensional supersymmetric gauge theories can be understood via
type iib brane congurations, in which d3-branes are suspended between two ns5-branes [3, 4].
this construction gives an explanation of mirror symmetry in three dimensions via sl(2, z)
duality of type iib string theory. this mirror symmetry is also true for bps vortices and
exchanges particles and vortices [5, 6].

recently three-dimensional gauge theories have been studied and classied by using more
general type iib brane congurations, in which d3-branes are suspended between an ns5-brane
and a (p, q)5-brane [7]. in these brane congurations, the three-dimensional eld theories, in
general, turned out to be supersymmetric maxwell chern-simons gauge theories with n =
4, 3, 2, 1 supersymmetry. the n = 4 supersymmetry can only be realized in ns5-d3-ns5
conguration, which gives supersymmetric qed without chern-simons term. the ns5-d3-
(p, q)5 conguration gives n = 3, 2, 1 supersymmetric maxwell chern-simons theory, where
the n = 3 case [8, 9] is not much known although it is interesting.

the n = 2 supersymmetric maxwell chern-simons theory is comparably well known and
their soliton solutions have been considerably studied over the years [10, 11, 12, 13]. whereas the
maxwell-higgs model supports only electrically neutral vortices as topologically stable soliton
solutions [14], the addition of the chern-simons term gives rise to topologically stable solutions
that are electrically charged and carry magnetic ux and non-zero angular momentum [15, 16].
in this theory, there exist topological as well as nontopological bps multisoliton solutions
since, in three dimensions, the superpotential allows symmetry broken and unbroken vacua [11].
thus, there can be a peculiar solution known as the (topological) domain wall which is a one-
dimensional object in three dimensions [16, 17]. in crossing the domain wall, the vacua are
dierent on two sides. in addition, it is known that there can also be (nontopological) domain
walls residing in the symmetric phases [16, 17]. in this paper we will discuss how these kinds
of topological objects can be described in terms of the above brane congurations.

the organization of the paper is as follows. in sect. 2, by using the similar method taken
in refs. [7, 18], we classify bps congurations consisting of relatively rotated two m5-branes
with nc m2-branes in between and nf m5-branes as well as other m2-branes corresponding to

2

solitons in three dimensions. we identify possible supersymmetry for each m-brane congura-
tion. these are then transformed to the brane congurations in type iib string theory after
compactifying the m-theory and then applying t-duality. this construction will provide the
classication of all possible bps solitons such as topological and nontopological bps vortices
in three-dimensional supersymmetric maxwell chern-simons system. although there is a bps
m2-brane which may be a plausible candidate for the bps domain wall constructed in eld
theory [16, 17], we have not been able to identify an appropriate conguration for nite energy
density solution. in sect. 3, we study topological bps vortices as well as nontopological vortices
by using the m-brane congurations constructed in sect. 2. we compare the brane congura-
tions with the soliton spectra already known from eld theories and obtain a nice agreement
with eld theory results. in sect. 4, we summarize our main results and give qualitative argu-
ments on the topological as well as nontopological bps domain wall solutions. we also discuss
mirror symmetry for the solitons, and indicate future directions.

after the completion of this paper, we were informed from k. ohta [19] that he also inde-
pendently arrived at similar results on the moduli space of vacua in theories considered here.

2 bps brane congurations

the authors of ref. [7] examined three-dimensional gauge dynamics by using type iib brane
congurations. they obtained these from the m-theory congurations of m2-branes suspended
between two m5-branes at angles [18]. the bps brane congurations in supersymmetric m-
brane backgrounds can be obtained by the following intersection rules [20]: in the m2-brane
background, an m2-brane probe can preserve 1/4 supersymmetry only without overlap and an
m5-brane probe can only in string intersection.
in the m5-brane background, an m5-brane
probe can preserve 1/4 supersymmetry only in string or three brane intersections and an m2-
brane probe can only in string intersection. these situations give various brane congurations
and residual supersymmetries.

in this section, we construct the brane congurations corresponding to three-dimensional
gauge theories with soliton solutions. for this purpose we need to count the number of su-
persymmetries remaining in the brane congurations. the cases of our interest are realized

by inserting other m2-branes intersecting the gm5-branes that give rise to the hypermultiplets.

after compactication on x (the symbol  indicates the eleventh direction, 10) and t2-duality
(the subscript 2 stands for the direction of t-duality) of the brane congurations, these are
reduced to the type iib brane congurations. the m2-branes are transformed to a d1-brane
or a d3-brane which correspond to the vortex or domain wall solutions, respectively. we now
explain each case separately.

first let us consider an m2-brane andgm5-branes between two m5-branes with relative angles
and another gm2-brane in the directions x2 and xa (the superscript a indicates one direction

out of 7, 8, and 9 according to the intersection rules), which corresponds to the d1(0a) string
embedded in d5(012789)-brane in type iib string theory. the worldvolumes of these branes
are given by

where the vertical line in m2-brane worldvolume denotes that 6th direction is bounded by the
two m5-branes, and the vertical arrays in the second m5-brane worldvolume indicate that the

brane is rotated along the planes by the indicated angles. the gm2 is necessary for our purpose

but was not in ref. [7]. these branes impose the following constraints on the killing spinor
 [18]:

where the rotation matrix for the second m5-brane is parameterized by the four angles as

since 0129 = 1 and so 01789 = 016012345, the condition (6) is a redundant one. so we
must solve just eqs. (2)-(5) simultaneously as functions of the four angles , ,  and . since
r012345r1 = r2012345, eq. (4) becomes

(r2  1) = 0.

the gamma matrices appearing in the spinor constraints commute with each other except
02a. since the square of the matrices is unity and the traces of their products vanish, we can
arrange these matrices by the same method as in refs. [7, 18] in the following forms:

012345 = diag. (116,116) ,
237 = diag. (18,18,  ) ,
248 = diag. (14,14, 14,14,  ) ,
259 = diag. (12,12, 12,12, 12,12, 12,12,  ) ,

(10)

where 1n denotes n n identity matrix, and the rests of eq. (9) are determined by the products
of the above matrices. since 0129 = 1, 016 is also determined by the products of the gamma
matrices in eq. (10) as

016  1 = 2  diag.(02, 12, 12, 02, 12, 02, 02, 12,  ).

(11)

on the gamma matrix basis (10), we have the following expression:

r2  1 = 2r2 diag. sin

considering the above expression of 016, the remaining supersymmetry is now determined by
the sin functions of the four angles in the 1st, 4th, 6th and 7th blocks of r2  1 matrix. we
summarize in table 1 the bps brane congurations at angles and the various supersymmetric
theories in three dimensions obtained in ref. [7] in the absence of the gm2, where we indicated

that the simultaneous solution to eqs. (5) and (8) can induce a new constraint depending on
their commutativity. one solution is obtained when the gamma matrices appearing in eq. (9)
all commute with 02a and we have no further constraint. the other is when the gamma
matrices in eq. (9) do not commute with 02a, for which we have an additional condition on
the spinor :

[r2, 02a] = 0.

(13)

of course, in this case, the gamma matrices 02a cannot be simultaneously diagonalized.

let us consider the rst case. from the expression (9), we see that we must put at least
two angles to zero, resulting in two-angle cases. there are six possibilities for the gamma
matrices to commute with 02a. by examining each case separately, the a direction is uniquely
determined. the result is the following:

 =  = 0 (a = 7),

 =  = 0 (a = 8),

 =  = 0 (a = 9),

 =  = 0 (a = 9),  =  = 0 (a = 8),  =  = 0 (a = 7).

(14)

as an example, let us consider the  =  = 0 (a = 7) case. in order to nd the solution, it

is convenient to choose maximally diagonalized basis dierent from (10) and (11):

012345 = diag. (116,116) ,
4859 = diag. (18,18,  ) ,
016 = diag. (14,14, 14,14,  ) ,
027 = diag. (12,12, 12,12, 12,12, 12,12,  ) .

(16)

on this basis, the rst condition (2) kills the second 16 components of the killing spinor, and
we have to examine the conditions (3) and (8) for the rst 16 components. for  =  the
remaining supersymmetry is reduced by 1
branes (case 2-(i) in table 1) and this brane will correspond to a bps state (a vortex) in three
dimensions.

another example is to choose the angles as  =  = 0 (a = 9). we can again arrange the

matrices as

012345 = diag. (116,116) ,
259 = diag. (18,18,  ) ,
016 = diag. (14,14, 14,14,  ) ,
029 = diag. (12,12, 12,12, 12,12, 12,12,  ) ,

using eqs. (17), we can rewrite eq. (9) as

for  =  this case also reduces the supersymmetry by 1

dimensions. for the remaining cases in eq. (14), we also obtain similar vortex solutions.

without the gm2-brane (case 2-(ii) in table 1) and this also gives a bps state (a vortex) in three
next we consider the second case. our interest is in the four-angle cases corresponding to
n = 2 or n = 3 supersymmetry (cases 4-(ii) and (iii) in table 1) because bps states are
possible for these cases. for deniteness, let us choose a = 9 and the rotation matrix r2 as

r2 = exp{(2  59) + (37 + 48)} .

by a straightforward calculation, eq. (13) becomes

[r2, 029] = 029(e42  1)r2 1 + 259

 = 0,

which reduces to the following equation:

(21)

if  6= n/2 (n  z).5
in the four-angle case 4-(ii), one can directly check using eqs. (10)
and (11) that, if the constraints (2), (3), and (8) are imposed on the spinor , the number
of unbroken supersymmetry is four (n = 2). the condition (21) does not produce further
constraints. interestingly, however, the n = 3 supersymmetry ( = , case 4-(iii) in table 1)
is further broken to n = 2 by the condition (21). since the gamma matrix 02a squares to
unity and is traceless, its eigenvalues must be 1 and the multiplicities of these eigenvalues
should be the same. moreover, since the traces of products with the gamma matrices in the
spinor constraints vanish, the condition (5) further breaks supersymmetry at least by half.

consequently, the condition (5) maximally preserves the n = 1 supersymmetry and so gm2-
brane will correspond to a bps state (a vortex) in n = 2 or n = 3 supersymmetric theory.
this is consistent with the eld theory results in [8, 9, 11, 13].
for other cases with the rotation matrix dierent from (19), the direction a of gm2-brane

should be dierently chosen. for example, if we take

r2 = exp{(2  37) + (48 + 59)} ,

(22)

then a = 7 and similar solutions can be obtained.

for the purpose to construct nontopological vortices, let us consider another dm2-brane in
the (b, ) directions, instead of the gm2-brane in eq. (1), and then rotate it by the same rotation

r in eq. (7) (b indicates one direction out of 3, 4, and 5 according to the intersection rules).
the killing spinor condition for this brane is given by

cm2 : r0br1 = ,

instead of (5). note that the rotation in the planes containing neither b nor  does not aect the

dm2-brane. what we need for our purpose are not f-strings but d-strings or their composites,

so the angle  needs to be nonzero. we now seek for the simultaneous solutions to eqs. (2),
(3), (8), and (23). for deniteness, let us take b = 5. then eq. (23) is cast into

(23)

(24)

free massless hypermultiplet with n = 4 supersymmetry [11, 6]. it turns out that the supersymmetric pure
chern-simons system discussed in ref. [8] indeed corresponds to another limit, i.e., l6  0 with  xed, where
l6 is the length of d3-brane in the x6-direction. thus we here consider only the case of  6= /2.

where

r2

(26)

since the matrices r, r, and 05 are nonsingular, the condition (25) can be reduced to
the following form:

(r2

  r2

 ) = 22(sin  cos   cos  sin 259) = 0.

(27)

in n = 2 theory, in which we put rotation angles not involving  and b directions to zero
and  = , the condition (27) is essentially equal to (8) and so a redundant one. using eq. (8)
or (27), the spinor constraint (24) reduces to the following condition:

of course, for more general case (23), there are three possibilities for the b direction. the
results for each case are the following:

 =  = 0 (b = 5),  =  = 0 (b = 4),  =  = 0 (b = 3),

(29)

and the condition (28) is generalized to

appearing in the spinor constraints commute with each other and so can be simultaneously
diagonalized. we thus see that 0b can be taken in the same form as 029 in (17) and the

if we take the direction of the dm2-brane to satisfy the condition (29), all the gamma matrices
condition (27) no longer breaks supersymmetry. thus the dm2-brane totally preserves the
n = 1 supersymmetry, giving a bps state.
on the other hand, in n = 3 theory with  =  =  = , the condition (27) breaks
the supersymmetry from n = 3 to n = 2 as in the topological vortices. since the condition
(28) further breaks the supersymmetry by half, the dm2-brane totally preserves the n = 1
supersymmetry, again giving a bps state in n = 3 theory. since the dm2-branes will be
interpreted as the nontopological vortices, the above results are consistent with the fact that
nontopological bps vortices can exist only for  6= 0, i.e.,  6= 0.

finally we consider the other possibility of inserting the second m2-brane along the x5 and
x9 directions, which corresponds to d3-brane in type iib string theory. (of course, we can also
choose the extended directions of the m2-brane to be (x3, x7) or (x4, x8) instead of (x5, x9)
according to the intersection rules.) the condition (5) must be replaced with the condition

m2 : 059 = .

9

(31)

contrary to the case (1), 059 commutes with the gamma matrices in the spinor constraints.
all the gamma matrices can be simultaneously diagonalized and arranged as eqs. (10) and (11)
and

059 = diag. (1,1, 1,1, 1,1, 1,1, 1,1, 1,1, 1,1, 1,1,  ) .

(32)

the supersymmetry is further broken by half by the m2-brane and so the brane may be a bps
state (a domain wall) in three dimensions.

we have exhausted the m2-brane congurations in the presence of m-brane background (1)
without breaking supersymmetry completely, corresponding to bps states.6 in the next section,
we will realize the bps soliton states in three-dimensional eld theories in terms of these m-
congurations.

3 maxwell chern-simons vortices

in this section we will analyze the maxwell chern-simons vortices via type iib brane con-
gurations. these in turn can be obtained from the m-brane congurations constructed in
sect. 2 after compactifying the m-congurations along the eleventh direction and then applying
t2-duality [7]. in the process, the number of unbroken supersymmetries is preserved.

from table 1, we see that, if we set one of the four angles , , ,  in 3-(i) or 3-(ii) to zero,
supersymmetry is enhanced from n = 1 to n = 2, while, in 4-(i) and 4-(ii) cases, it is not
enhanced, for example, in the   0 limit where the chern-simons term vanishes. the n = 3
case is quite special since, in this case, the four angles should be equal.

as noted in sect. 2, in zero- and two-angle cases, there is a possibility to introduce the

gm2-brane preserving half of the supersymmetry and extended to (2 a)-plane. in type iib string

theory, this brane is just the d1-brane along the a-direction and, in three-dimensional eld
theory, this will correspond to a bps vortex solution as we will see.
in addition, we have
shown that the four-angle cases (4-(ii) and (iii) cases in table 1) also contain the spectrum
of supersymmetric bps vortices. as it will be shown, this fact is consistent with the eld
theory result [13, 16, 8, 9] that the n = 2 and n = 3 maxwell chern-simons theories admit
topological as well as nontopological vortex solutions.

6one may also consider an m-wave in eleven dimensions, in which case the killing spinor condition is 0 = .
the m-wave solution may give a d-string in type iib string theory because it reduces to a d0-brane in type
iia string theory. however, one can see that this solution does not preserve the supersymmetry in the m-
brane background (1). in this paper, we have not considered m5-brane probes in the m-brane background (1).
according to the intersection rules [20], possible m5-brane probes preserving 1/4 supersymmetry are m5(26ab)
and m5(26789), where a, b = 7, 8, 9 (a 6= b).

where  is a constant background of the type iib rr scalar. in the (p, q)5-brane background,
the instanton coupling on the d3-brane worldvolume induces the chern-simons coupling  =
 as discussed in ref. [7]. in this background, the integer charge q2 is shifted by an arbitrary
amount  due to an analogue of wittens eect that the electric charge of a monopole is shifted
when theta-angle  is switched on [22]. thus, although q2 = 0, a d-string can carry the electric
charge qe proportional to the magnetic charge qm: qe = ||qm.

3.1 maxwell-higgs vortices

hanany and witten explained the mirror symmetry in three dimensions through the sl(2, z)
duality of type iib superstring [3]. they considered the supersymmetric conguration with nc
d3-branes in (1, 2, 6) directions suspended between two ns5-branes in (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) directions
with denite values of x6 coordinate. this conguration gives n = 4 supersymmetric theory
in three dimensions. we can also construct the gauge eld theories with matter elds, if we
insert other nf d5-branes in (1, 2, 7, 8, 9) directions preserving n = 4 supersymmetry. these
congurations explain the n = 4 su(nc) super yang-mill theories with nf hypermultiplets.
this may be generalized by rotating the second ns5-brane by suitable angles.

first let us consider the brane conguration corresponding to the case 1 in table 1 where
two ns5-branes are parallel to each other, i.e.,  =  =  =  = 0. this corresponds to
n = 4 supersymmetric su(nc) gauge theory with nf hypermultiplets. here we discuss only
the nc = 1 and nf = 1 case. this conguration is depicted in fig. 1-(a) in which one d3-brane
in the direction (126) is suspended between two ns5-branes in (12345) and intersects with a
d5-brane in (12789). the same is drawn in fig. 1-(b) when it is seen from the x6 direction.
from this conguration, we get u(1) gauge theory with a massless avor in the fundamental
representation with no fayet-iliopoulos (fi) terms.

(for supersymmetric gauge theories, see, for example, ref. [23].)

the n = 4 vector multiplet consists of an n = 2 real vector multiplet v and a chiral
in n = 2
multiplet .
superspace [12], the vector multiplet v is composed of a ( = 0, 1, 2), which are the gauge
elds on d3-brane worldvolume, and x3 which corresponds to the a3 component of the four-
dimensional gauge eld. the chiral multiplet  contains x4 and x5, which correspond to strings
describing uctuations of the d3-brane in the transverse directions (x4, x5). in addition, there
are hypermultiplets consisting of q and q in the fundamental representation, which originate

where w  is the eld strength supereld for the real spinor gauge supereld u (x, ) and  is
the three-dimensional spinor index.

if we turn on fi couplings for the n = 4 vector multiplets v and 
2z d3xd2 + h.c.! ,

sf i = v2z d3xd4v   w2

the scalar potential u in the action (34) with (35) is given by

this potential allows only a symmetry broken vacuum:

|q|2  |q|2 = v2, q q = w2, x3 =  = 0.

(35)

(37)

note that the fi terms come from the relative positions in (789)-directions of the ns5- and
ns5-branes. the peculiar fact is that, if the fi coupling w for the complex scalar eld  is
nonzero, the hypermultiplet should have all nonzero vacuum expectation values.

ns5-brane in (123h 4

next we consider the brane conguration corresponding to 2-(i) in table 1 where the ns5-
brane is at angle  =  = 0 and  = . this conguration was considered by the authors of
refs. [4] and corresponds to n = 2 supersymmetric u(1) gauge theory with a massless avor in
the fundamental representation with no fi terms. this conguration is also depicted in fig. 1-
(a) in which one d3-brane in the direction (126) is suspended between ns5 in (12345) and
) and intersects with a d5-brane in (12789). note that the masses
of matters with avors correspond to the position dierences in (345)-directions between the
d3- and d5-branes. for this theory, all the terms in eq. (35) are no longer what would be called
fi terms, which break either supersymmetry or internal symmetry. because the second ns5-
brane is rotated in (8,9)-directions, the 5-brane shifts in these directions can be compensated by
the d3-brane shifts in the (4,5)-directions, so that it is possible to preserve both supersymmetry
and internal symmetry. on the other hand, the shift in the relative position in the 7-direction
of the ns5- and ns5-branes corresponds to a real fi term.

8ih 5
9i

in n = 1 superspace, the mass terms for the hypermultiplet are given by

sm =z d3xd2(cid:16)4x 2

5(cid:17) .

(38)
in eq. (38), |4| and |5| correspond to masses for the scalar elds x4 and x5. these masses
originate from the relative rotations of the ns5-brane in the (4, 8) and (5, 9) directions. the
n = 2 supersymmetry requires that the masses of the scalar elds should be equal to each
other, i.e., 4 = 5  m. when this relation is satised, eq. (38) can be written as

4 + 5x 2

z d3xd2(m2 + h.c.),

sf i = v2z d3xd4v.

13

in n = 2 superspace. we thus see that the shift of the scalar component of  (corresponding
to the d3-brane shifts in (4,5)-directions) cancels the second terms (linear in ) in eq. (35) and
also produces mass terms for the hypermultiplets from the last term in eq. (34). as a result,
there exists a phase in which the gauge symmetry is unbroken. this is what we mean when we
say that the second terms in eq. (35) are not fi terms, and is consistent with our above brane
picture.

since the only mass scale in this theory is g2, we see, from the action (34) with (39), that
the mass of the chiral multiplet  is given by |mg2| and the hypermultiplets q, q and the
vector multiplet v are massless. for simplicity, we take the rotation angle  = /2. since then
the mass of the chiral multiplet  goes to innity, the chiral eld  decouples from the theory
and can be set to zero, but this simplication does not aect our results.

if we turn on the fi coupling for the vector multiplet by a position dierence between the
ns5- and ns5-branes in the 7-direction, this introduces a linear superpotential in the action
(34) like

(39)

from the actions (34) and (40), the scalar potential u can be easily read o as

u =

g2

3 (|q|2 + |q|2).

the potential u allows only a symmetry broken vacuum:

|q| = v,

|q| = 0, x3 = 0.

(41)

(42)

it is well known that the symmetry broken vacuum (42) admits topological nielsen-olesen
vortices [24, 25, 13], where it is shown that the mass of n vortices is 2v2n and the number of
zero modes is 2n corresponding to the positions of n vortices. now we will identify these bps
solutions with the type iib brane congurations.

consider the higgs branch (42) of the model (34) sketched in fig. 1-(c) and (d). as shown in
the gure, the right-hand ns-brane is shifted by v2 along the 7-direction. this shift introduces
the fi d-term (40). let us further consider additional d-strings extended to the 7-direction
together with the brane conguration in fig. 1-(c). since the d-strings can end on the d3-
branes, we can obtain the d-strings with nite length, which means nite energy. we have
shown in sect. 2 that these d-strings preserve half the supersymmetry, and so should correspond
to bps states. here we claim that we can identify the d-strings with the topological nielsen-
olesen vortices in the maxwell-higgs theory. the vorticity n is just the number of the d-strings.
since v2 has the dimension of mass and is related to the tension of the stretched d-string, we
can interpret it as the mass of a vortex. from the brane conguration in fig. 1-(c), we see
that the strings can freely move on the (1, 2)-plane, so the translational zero modes of the n
d-strings are 2n. thus our identication is consistent with the eld theory results.

note that the chiral multiplet  is neutral with respect to the gauge group u(1) although it
is charged under the u(1)4,5 rotation group in the (x4, x5) directions. thus the presence of 
in the theory does not seriously change the story on the existence of the soliton solution. if we
set 4 = 5  m = 0, the vortex solutions obtained above can also be considered as the bps
vortices in n = 4 theory. this class of solutions should be obtained from the bps solutions in
four-dimensional n = 2 qed.

with the nf d5-branes in (12789). on this conguration, we get u(1) gauge theory with
massless nf avors in the fundamental representation with no fi terms. (here we will take
nf = 1 for simplicity.) note that the masses of hypermultiplets correspond to the position
dierences in (345)-directions between the d3-brane and the d5-branes and the fi terms come
from the relative positions in (78)-directions of the ns5-brane and the (p, q)5-brane. these fi
terms are those with the coecient w2 in eq. (35). in fact, we will see that theories only with
the rst term have a symmetry-unbroken phase.

in n = 2 superspace [12], the vector multiplet v is composed of a and x5 corresponding
to the a3 component of the four-dimensional gauge eld and the chiral multiplet  contains x3
and x4, which correspond to strings describing uctuations of the d3-brane in the transverse
directions (x3, x4). there are also hypermultiplets consisting of q and q in the fundamental
representation. similarly to the maxwell-higgs theory in (34), we can write down the n = 2
supersymmetric action in the coulomb branch for the brane conguration in fig. 2-(a) [13]:

(43)

in eq. (43), 0 and 5 correspond to masses for the gauge eld a and the scalar eld x5. these
masses originate from the simultaneous rotations of the (p, q)5-brane in the (2, ) and (5, 9)
directions. the n = 2 supersymmetry requires that the masses of the gauge eld and the scalar

15

eld should be equal to each other, i.e., 0 = 5  .7 since we set the hypermultiplet masses
and fi couplings to zero, the only mass scale in this theory is g2. in fact, from the action (43),
we see that the mass of the vector multiplet v is given by |g2| and the hypermultiplets q, q
and the chiral multiplet  are massless.8 for simplicity, we x the location of the d3-brane in
the (3, 4)-plane and put the chiral multiplet  to zero.

if we shift the positions between the ns5- and (p, q)5-branes in the 9-direction, this intro-

duces a linear term in the action (43)

sf i = v2z d3xd4v.

from the actions (43) and (44), the scalar potential u can be easily read o as

u =

g2

2 (cid:16)|q|2  |q|2  v2 + x5(cid:17)2

+ x 2

5 (|q|2 + |q|2).

the potential u allows both symmetry broken and unbroken vacua:

symmetry broken phase : |q| = v,
symmetry unbroken phase : |q| = |q| = 0, x5 =

|q| = 0, x5 = 0,
v2
.


(44)

(45)

(46)

(47)

notice that the linear term (44) allows symmetry unbroken vacuum and this agrees with the
brane picture that the shift of the 5-branes in the 9-direction is compensated by the d3-brane
shift in the 5-direction. it is well known [13, 16] that the symmetry unbroken phase admits
nontopological bps multisoliton solutions, while the symmetry broken phase admits topological
bps multisoliton solutions. now our next goal is to nd the type iib brane realizations for
these soliton solutions.

3.2.1 topological vortices

first we go to the higgs branch (46) of the model (43) sketched in fig. 2-(c). as shown in the
gure, the right-hand d3-brane is slidden by v2 along the 9-direction. this introduces the fi
d-term (44). since the transverse uctuations of the d3-branes along the (3, 4)-plane are highly
suppressed, the chiral eld  decouples from the theory and can be set to zero. in this higgs
tan  = p/q is dimensionless, so our  corresponds to /g2
in [9, 13, 16].
in ref. [9, 13], supersymmetric pure chern-simons system was obtained by taking the limit
   with the ratio /g2 xed. in our notation, their limit corresponds to  = xed and g2  . since
1/g2 = l6/gs, supersymmetric pure chern-simons theory can be obtained by taking the limit l6  0. as
discussed in ref. [7], since x6-dependent kaluza-klein modes can be ignored as long as   1/gs, the low-
energy approximation in the three-dimensional gauge theory should be valid if the string coupling constant gs
is suciently small.

branch, the theory is mapped to the n = 2 maxwell chern-simons theory studied in ref. [13],
where the mass of n vortices is 2v2n and the number of zero modes is 2n corresponding to
the positions of n vortices.

let us consider the d-strings extended to the 9-direction together with the brane congu-
ration in fig. 2-(c). we can now apply the similar logic as that in sect. 3.1. since the d-strings
ending on the d3-branes have a nite length, the d-strings have a nite energy proportional to
their length. we have shown in sect. 2 that these d-strings preserve half the supersymmetry,
and so correspond to bps states. thus we can identify the d-strings, i.e. (1, 0)-strings, with
the topological vortices in the maxwell chern-simons theory. note that, in the presence of the
axion eld , the tension formula (33) implies that the vortex also carries electric charge qe
proportional to magnetic charge qm, i.e. qe = qm, as an analogue of wittens eect. field
theoretically, this is just gauss law constraint [15, 16]. the vorticity n is just the number of
the d-strings. since v2 has the dimension of mass and is related to the tension of the stretched
d-string, we can also interpret it as the mass of a vortex. from the brane conguration in
fig. 2-(c), we see that the strings can freely move on the (1, 2)-plane, so the translational zero
modes of the n d-strings are 2n. thus our identication is consistent with the eld theory
results [16, 25, 13].

3.2.2 nontopological vortices

next we consider the symmetry unbroken phase (47). we summarize the corresponding brane
conguration in fig. 3-(a). the d5-brane is lifted up along the 5-direction by v2/ relative to
the d3-brane, which gives the eld x5 a vacuum expectation value as in (47). then eq. (45)
shows that it also induces the mass m = |v2/| to the hypermultiplets q and q.

here we will focus on the b = 5 case out of the dm2-branes constructed in sect. 2 which
9i
compactication, the dm2-brane reduces to either f-string in the h 5
the (cid:16)2h 5
9i(cid:17)-directions depending on their worldvolumes, and further t2-dual transformation
9i
gives the d1f1 bound state in the h 5
-direction. since the dm2-brane is rotated from x by

 in the (2, )-plane, the number (q1, q2) characterizing the (d1,f1) bound state satises the
relation: gs tan  = q1/q2. the (d1,f1) bound state has been studied in ref. [2] where it has
been shown that for the conguration of parallel f-string and d-string, the f-string dissolves
in the d-string, leaving ux behind and the resulting bound state, i.e. d-string with ux, is
supersymmetric. in addition, it has been shown that there is a bound string saturating the
bps bound for all (q1, q2) with relatively prime q1 and q2, named a (q1, q2)-string [21]. if the
axion eld in (33) is shifted by q2/q1, that is,  =  q2/q1 in the presence of (q1, q2)-string,
the nontopological vortex also carries electric charge qe proportional to magnetic charge qm,
i.e. qe = qm, which is consistent with eld theory result [15, 16].

here we propose the type iib brane conguration for the nontopological bps vortices as
the form in fig. 3-(c), where they are represented by the d-strings with uxes connecting two
d3-branes.9 from the eld theory [13, 16, 25], we know that the magnetic ux  and electric
charge q of the nontopological vortices are not quantized;  = q/ = 2(n + ), where
n is the vorticity of the solitons and   n + 2 is an undetermined parameter characterizing
the asymptotic behavior of the solutions. it was shown that the number of zero modes in the
nontopological soliton background is 2n + 2   2, where  is the greatest integer less than
. we interpret the number n as the number of d-strings since they can freely move on the
(1, 2)-plane, so the translational zero modes of the n d-strings are 2n.10 in ref. [16], 2   2
is interpreted as the moduli parameters specifying the uxes and the u(1) phases of lumps. if
our identication is correct, it should be related to the moduli parameters of f-string uxes.

3.2.3 n = 3 theories
next let us consider bps vortices in n = 3 theories [8, 9]. the supersymmetry analysis in
sect. 2 shows that the gm2-brane also corresponds to a bps vortex solution preserving 1/16
supersymmetry in n = 3 theory. the n = 3 maxwell chern-simons theory was considered in
ref. [9] and the action can be obtained from (43) by further adding mass terms for the chiral

9the dynamics on upper d3-brane in fig. 3-(c) or (d) is not gauge theory but dual scalar theory. this brane
only serves as a boundary state invisible in the lower d3-brane. on the other hand, the theory on the lower
d3-brane is just our u (1) maxwell chern-simons gauge theory.

10although fig. 3-(c) shows that the vortices can move along the x6, the moduli of this motion are massive

since x6 has a nite interval.

the brane congurations for the bps vortices in n = 3 theory, for example, in the case 4-
(iii) in table 1 are essentially the same as those in figs. 2 and 3. the d-strings in the asymmetric
phase (49) and (q1, q2)-strings in the symmetric phase (50) correspond to the topological and
nontopological vortices, respectively, constructed in ref. [9] (where the potential u is of the case
w2 = 0 in (48)).

as discussed in footnote 7, the vortex solutions of n = 2 and n = 3 supersymmetric
chern-simons systems considered in refs. [11, 8] could be obtained by taking the limit l6  0
with  xed from the n = 2 and n = 3 maxwell chern-simons theory, respectively.

4 discussions

in this paper we have considered the m-brane congurations which can be reduced to type iib
branes corresponding to bps solitons in three-dimensional gauge theories. in a given m-brane
background preserving n = 4, 3, 2 supersymmetry, we have found bps m2-branes preserving
n = 2, 1 supersymmetry, where the n = 2 case is obtained only for n = 4 theory and we
have identied the brane congurations with soliton spectra of the eld theories. although our
construction via the type iib branes can achieve nice agreements with the vortex solutions of
eld theory, the type iib brane construction of bps domain wall solutions remain an open
problem. we will briey discuss bps m2-branes which are plausible candidates for the bps
domain wall solutions in eld theory.

type iib brane construction in this paper will be universally valid provided that l6 <
ls < 1/g2. thus the supersymmetric chern-simons theories can be obtained by taking the
limit l6  0 from maxwell chern-simons theories with a chern-simons coupling  xed,
since, in the limit, the mass of gauge boson becomes innite and so the kinetic maxwell term
is decoupled. note, in the limit, that, in the case of maxwell theory without chern-simons
term, the gauge boson remains massless so that the vector multiplet does not decouple, i.e., the

19

theory ows only to strong coupling limit. on the other hand, when    in n = 3 theory,
the vector multiplet completely decouples and the supersymmetry is enhanced to n = 4. in
the limit, the theory ows to a free theory of massless hypermultiplets [6].

in three-dimensional maxwell chern-simons theory, it is known that there can be bps
domain wall solitons [16, 17]: topological domain walls interpolating the symmetric and asym-
metric phases, and nontopological domain walls residing in the symmetric phase. the domain
walls constructed in eld theory are nite energy density solutions. as also noted in sect. 2, we
can introduce the m2-brane preserving the supersymmetry and extended to (5, 9)-directions.
in type iib string theory, this brane will be a d3-brane extended in the (2, 5, 9)-directions
and, in three-dimensional eld theory, this will correspond to a one-dimensional object ex-
tended along the x2 direction (maybe a domain wall). however, there are some problems in
the solution. first of all, the brane conguration do not give nite energy density solutions.
for such solutions, we need d3-branes with nite area in the (5, 9)-plane. next, in the cases of
n = 1 and n = 3 theory, there is no explicitly known bps domain wall solution in eld theory
whereas the supersymmetry analysis in sect. 2 shows that the m2-brane preserves fractional
supersymmetry. however, note that the domain wall solution can be reduced to two dimen-
sional eld theory solution as in [17]. then the n = 1 or n = 3 theory corresponds to the
two-dimensional n = (1, 1) or n = (3, 3) supersymmetry, respectively. thus, even in these
cases, the m2-brane may correspond to the bps states in the sense of two-dimensional eld
theory.

nevertheless, let us speculate possible brane congurations for the topological and non-
topological domain walls. consider the congurations in figs. 2-(c) and 3-(a) altogether. the
resulting congurations are sketched in fig. 4. in sect. 2, we have shown that there can be
a bps state represented by a d3-brane extended along the (2, 5, 9)-directions. the desired
solution is d3-branes conned along the 5 and 9 directions to obtain a nite energy density
solution. if we could have a d3-brane solution with nite area such as the triangle in fig. 4-(b)
or (d), its energy density e, energy per unit length, will be given by the area of the triangle,
i.e., e = v4/, which is coincident with the eld theory result [16, 17].

if it is correct, according to the classication in refs. [16, 17], the solution depicted in fig. 4-
(a) or (b) will correspond to a topological bps domain wall since the d3-brane is interpolating
the symmetric and asymmetric phases. on the other hand, the solution in fig. 4-(c) or (d) will
correspond to a nontopological domain wall since it is residing only in the symmetric phase.

unfortunately, it seems that such a d3-brane solution in type iib supergravity realizing the
bps domain wall solution with nite energy density has not been known until now. so at the
moment it is dicult to speculate the problem more precisely. it will be interesting to look at
these problems more closely both in eld theory side and in string theory side.

finally let us briey discuss mirror symmetry [3, 4, 5, 6] for soliton spectra. since the
mirror symmetry is obtained from the sl(2, z) transformation s of type iib string theory
and a rotation r that maps xi to xi+4 (i = 3, 4, 5), the combined operation rs exchanges
ns-branes (e.g., ns5-brane and f-string) to d-branes (e.g., d5-brane and d-string) and maps
d3-brane to itself. moreover the mirror map exchanges the higgs and coulomb branches. thus
the mirror symmetry transforms a d-string corresponding a soliton in the higgs phase into an
f-string corresponding to a fundamental particle in the coulomb phase. this means that the
mirror symmetry exchanges particles and vortices [6, 5]. as discussed in refs. [7, 6], the mirror
symmetry transforms maxwell chern-simons theory into self-dual model with chern-simons
coupling  = 1/ = q/p in ref. [26]. if the mirror symmetry is exact in n = 2 or n = 3
theory, our vortex construction shows that the nontopological vortices have to transform into
those of the self-dual model represented by (q2,q1)-strings. thus we expect the mirror map in
maxwell chern-simons theory will have more rich spectrum. it will be interesting to explicitly
investigate the mirror symmetry and the brane creation in refs. [3, 7] including soliton sectors
in the theory.

in this paper we have only considered abelian gauge theories. however one may also
construct the non-abelian yang-mills chern-simons theory and its higgs phase via type iib
brane congurations. (the n = 3 supersymmetric non-abelian chern-simons theory and its
breaking to n = 2 is partially constructed in [19].) we hope that the generalization of the
present work will be achieved near future.
