retains formally original 3-dimensional conguration space, however plays role gauge variable. shall follow second route, since want maintain contact top dynamics close possible. case constraint (2.3) taken weak sense, i.e. initial condition. instead canonical hamiltonian hc one introduces case extended hamil- tonian h = hc + a(t)p (2.5) a(t) arbitrary function, reecting fact gauge system. generating function innitesimal gauge transformation transformed hamiltonian reads f = p(t) h = h + f = hc + a(t)p a(t) = a(t) + (t). note also = + {f, } = + (t) 5 quantum theory constraint (2.3)

classical model spinning particle elaborated  involves non-standard ap- proach model cannot described lagrangian. due absence rotational kinetic energy hamiltonian spinning particle non- lagrangian
