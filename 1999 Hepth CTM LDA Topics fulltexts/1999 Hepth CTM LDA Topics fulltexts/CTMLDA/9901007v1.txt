bosonic description of a tomonaga-luttinger

model with impurities

abstract

we extend a recently proposed non-local version of colemans
equivalence between the thirring and sine-gordon models to the case
in which the original fermion elds interact with xed impurities. we
explain how our results can be used in the context of one-dimensional
strongly correlated systems (the so called tomonaga-luttinger model)
to study the dependence of the charge-density oscillations on the range
of the fermionic interactions.

in a recent paper [1] a non-local generalization of colemans equiv-
alence between the massive thirring and sine-gordon models [2] was es-
tablished. specically it was proved the identity of the vacuum to vacuum
functionals corresponding to the following (euclidean) lagrangian densities:

lt = i / +

2

g2 z d2yj(x)v()(x, y)j(y)  m 

and

lsg =

1
2

((x))2 +

1

2 z d2y(x)d()(x, y)(y) 

0
2 cos ,

(1)

(2)

where j(x) is the usual fermion current, v()(x, y) and d()(x, y) ( = 0, 1)
are arbitrary functions of |x  y| whose fourier transforms ( v()(p) and
d()(p)) must be related by

1
v(1) + p2
1

g2
 (p2

0

v(0)) + p2

=

2
4(p2 + d(0)p2

0 + d(1)p2
1)

(3)

for the sake of clarity, we have omitted the p-dependence of the potentials.
when v()(x, y) = 2(x  y) and d()(x, y) = 0 one reobtains the usual local
equivalence (let us also mention that with the present convention attractive
potentials correspond to positive values of v()). of course, the usual identity

m =

0
2

(4)

also holds in this non-local context.

the purpose of this letter is to extend the above result in two directions.
first of all we shall consider a coordinate-dependent mass in our non-local
version of the thirring model. at the same time we will also add a local
interaction between the fermion current and a classical background eld c.
in other words, we shall modify equation (1) above by setting m = 0 and
adding

limp = /c  m(x) 

(5)

where the name limp refers to the fact that this density can be used to
study the interaction between electrons and impurities [3].
indeed, if one
uses (1) (with m = 0) in order to describe the forward scattering of one-
dimensional spinless electrons [4] [5], then the rst (second) term in the

1

rhs of (5) models the forward (backward) scattering between electrons and
impurities. in particular, if we choose

c0(x) = v (x0)(x1  d) = m(x)

where v is a constant, together with

c1(x) = 0,

(6)

(7)

our model coincides with the one recently considered in ref.[6] to study friedel
charge-density oscillations in a 1d tomonaga-luttinger liquid [7] with an im-
purity located at x1 = d. moreover, the bosonic vacuum to vacuum func-
tional we shall derive here can also be used to compute the 2-point density
function and the electron propagator as functionals of the electron-electron
potential. the former was computed in ref.[8] (for a coulomb potential and
without impurities) where a wigner crystal structure was revealed. apart
from academic interest, these connections are the main practical motivation
for the present computation. before making contact with this solid-state
application, we now start by considering the general case (c(x) and m(x)
arbitrary). using a convenient representation of the functional delta and
introducing the vector eld a (please see ref. [1] for details), the partition
function of the model under consideration can be written as
z = z dadet(i/ + g/a + /c  m(x))es[a],

(8)

with

s(a) =

where v 1

() is such that

1

2 z d2xd2yv 1

() (x, y)a(x)a(y),

z d2z v 1

() (z, x)v()(y, z) = 2(x  y).

(9)

(10)

as it is known, the massive-like determinant in equation (8) cannot be
exactly solved, even in the local case. however, we were able to write the
vacuum to vacuum functional in such a way that non-local terms are not
present in the determinant. then, following [1], we can decouple a and
c from fermions by performing chiral and gauge transformations in the
fermionic path-integral measure, with parameters (x) and (x) respectively:

(x) = exp[g(5(x) + i(x))](x),

(11)

2

(and a similar expression for (x)) and writing

a(x) = (x)  (x) 

1
g

c(x).

(12)

taking into account the non-trivial fujikawa jacobian [9] associated to the
fermionic transformation, which gives a local kinetic term for (x), we obtain

z = z d dddesef f

where

sef f = s0b + z d2x( i/  m(x) e2g5),

() (y, x)(x)(y)

() (y, x)(x)(y)
(0) (y, x)0(x)1(y)

s0b = g2

() (x, y)c(x)c(y).

(13)

(15)

note that the last term of sob is eld independent (remember that c(x)
is a classical function), thus its contribution can be absorbed in a path-
integral normalization constant n[c] which is relevant if one is interested
in functional derivatives of z with respect to c(x). since here we are mainly
concerned with vacuum to vacuum functionals we shall disregard this factor.
its contribution will be recovered at the end of this work, where the evaluation
of the fermion current v.e.v. will be sketched. let us also mention that
one should be more careful with this normalization when considering the
nite temperature version of the present calculation, which could be easily
done by following the lines of ref.
[10]. on the other hand, the rst term
in (15) comes from the contribution of the previously mentioned fermionic
jacobian. exactly as it was done in [1], the partition function for the model
can be formally expanded in powers of m(x). in fact, the x dependence of
this perturbative parameter, together with the appearance of c(x) in the
bosonic action are the new features of the present computation. as far as
these functions are well-behaved one can assume the existence of every term
in the following series:

z =



xn=0

n!

yj=1

z d2xjm(xj) (xj)e2g5(xj )(xj) >0

(16)

it is not dicult to convince oneself that the same manipulations used
in [1], in order to compute fermionic and bosonic v.e.vs at every order of
perturbation theory, also work in the present case. this allows to write

in these expressions ,  and v() are the fourier transforms of ,  and v()
respectively. equation (17) is our rst non-trivial result. it is the extension
of the result presented in [1] to the case m  m(x) and c(x) 6= 0.

let us now briey make our second relevant observation which concerns
the way of constructing a purely bosonic model that gives the same expansion
as in (17). it is straightforward to show that such model can be obtained
from equation (2) by setting 0 = 0 and adding

l

imp = f(x)(x) 

0(x)

cos 

(23)

where f(x) represents a couple of classical functions to be related to the
cs and 0(x) is the x-dependent version of 0, to be related, of course,
to m(x). again, going to momentum space and employing standard proce-
dures to evaluate each v.e.v., the partition function z  corresponding to this
generalized sine-gordon model can be expressed as

z  =

by comparing equation (24 ) with equation (17), we nd that both series

are identical if not only equation (3) holds, but one also has:

(26)

therefore, we have obtained an equivalence between the partition func-
tions z and z  corresponding to the non-local thirring and sine-gordon
models with extra interactions dened above, in equations (5) and (23) re-
spectively. note that, apart from eq.(3) which was already obtained in [1] and
eq.(25) which is a trivial generalization of eq.(4), eq.(26) should be considered
the specic original contribution of the present work. as stated in the intro-
ductory paragraph, this path-integral identication allows to make contact
with recent descriptions of 1d electronic systems (the so called tomonaga-
luttinger model) in the presence of xed (not randomly distributed) impu-
rities [6]. we shall devote the remainder of this letter to briey discuss this
possibility. to be specic we shall consider the mean value of the fermionic
current dened by:

(27)

1
z

z
c

hji = 

5

this is an interesting object because j0 is the charge density whereas j1 is
the electric current. please recall that the usual version of the tomonaga-
luttinger model, where only density-density uctuations are taken into ac-
count, corresponds to the choice [1]

v(1) = 0

(28)

concerning the impurity, it is evident that after performing the functional
derivative in eq.(27) one has to use equations (6) and (7) for c0 and c1. at
this point the way of exploiting the above depicted procedure, i.e. the equiv-
alence between z and z , as a bosonizing scheme, becomes apparent. indeed,
one has just to enforce condition (28) in (3) and (26) and then use eq.(27)
with z  instead of z. for the most relevant case of j0 one has to keep in mind
that there will be an extra term coming from the disregarded c0-dependent
factor in z (please remember the comments on n[c] that followed equation
(15)). however this is not a big trouble, since the corresponding contribution
can be obtained by inspection yielding

hj0(x)i = 

1
z

(29)

we want to stress that this expression gives the charge density of a tomonaga-
luttinger electronic liquid, with a non-magnetic impurity located at x1 = d,
as functional of the electron-electron potential. thus our present proposal
can be considered as an alternative path-integral approach to explore the
joint eect of impurities and potentials on the charge density behavior. the
explicit calculation of the rst term would allow to check the result recently
reported in ref.[6], where a strong dependence of the density oscillations on
the range of the interaction was obtained . we hope to consider this issue in
a forthcoming article [11].
