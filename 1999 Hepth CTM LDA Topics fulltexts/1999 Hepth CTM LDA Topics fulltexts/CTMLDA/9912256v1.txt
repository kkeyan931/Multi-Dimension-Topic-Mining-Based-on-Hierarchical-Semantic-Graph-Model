i. introduction

cuss our main interest, the 2-d induced gravity case. fi-
nally, in section v we display our conclusions.

in theories of gravitation the canonical hamiltonian is
a linear combination of constraints, meaning that after
gauge xing it turns into a strongly zero quantity. this
is in brief the zero-hamiltonian problem (zh problem),
present, for a more general context, in dieomorphism
(di) invariant models.

two-dimensional (2-d) gravity models has been under
intensive investigation during the last two decades [1].
the old problem of quantum gravity, black holes physics
and string dynamics were tested in these formulations.
in particular, the so called induced gravity model was
proposed in the eighties by polyakov [2]; emerging as a
eld theory of gravitation after integration of the mat-
ter elds. in spite of its peculiar features and succesful
quantum formulation, the zh problem is also present in
polyakovs model.

the zh problem was analysed by henneaux, teitel-
boim and vergara [3] in a broad context. the idea was
to construct an extension on the original action that is in-
variant under gauge transformations not vanishing at the
end-points; the boundary conditions were therefore mod-
ied through the gauge generators. the extension men-
tioned above is related to the physical (eective) hamil-
tonian of the theory that it going to rule the dynamics of
the physical degrees of freedom. an alternative approach
was proposed by fulop, gitman and tyutin [4]; the main
point here is that one works in the reduced phase-space.
once determined the simplectic structure, after complete
gauge xing, a time-dependent canonical transformation
is performed, obtaining the dynamics generator for the
physical variables.

in this work we apply these methods to the 2-d in-
duced gravity model obtaining the dynamics and the ef-
fective hamiltonian in a sistematic way, working in re-
duced phase-space.

the manuscript is structured as follows. in section ii
we make a panoramic description of the methods men-
tioned above to analyse the zh problem. in section iii we
apply these techniques in the relativistic particle model,
working in the proper-time gauge. in section iv we dis-

ii. solving the zero-hamiltonian

problem

in this section we make a short review of the techniques
developed in [3] (and partially in [4]). these procedures
solve the zh problem, present in (di) invariant theories.
given a gauge system with di invariance we can write
its action as (we use nite-degrees-of-freedoms notation
for simplicity)

s = z ld = z 2

1

(pi qi  h0  aga)d ,

(1)

where the pis (i = 1, .., n ) represent the canonical mo-
menta conjugated to the coordinates qi, h0 is the canon-
ical hamiltonian and the a are lagrange multipliers. as
a consequence of the di invariance of the action, the
system has a set of a (a = 1, .., r) rst-class constraints.
they satisfy, by denition, the poisson algebra [5]

{ga, gb} = c c

abgc  0 ,

(2)

that in the case of gravity theories turns into the well-
known di algebra [8]. there are not second-class con-
straints.

the presence of the zh problem is a consequence of
the properties mentioned above. in fact, for di invari-
ant systems the total hamiltonian (ht ) is a linear com-
bination of constraints

ht = h0 + aga  0 ,

(3)

meaning that it is a strongly zero quantitiy after the
(complete) gauge xing procedure. this fact leaves no
generator of dynamics in the reduced phase-space [5] [3].
to solve the zh problem, henneaux teitelboim and
vergara [3] (and in a dierent context gitman and tiu-
tyn [4] ) proposed to perform an extension on s that
takes into account end-point contribuitions. the action
for the paths obeying these open boundary conditions (

1

the gauge parameters a do not vanish at the end points)
is

as usual, the action is proportional to the world-line

length

1

(pq  h0  aga)d  [pi

se = z 2
with g  aga, where the  are the gauge transformation
parameters in the extended hamiltonian formalism [5] [10]
[9]. the new boundary conditions are given by

pi  g]2
1 ,

g

(4)

q(i)  [q  {q, g}](i)

i = 1, 2 ,

(5)

with analogous expression for the new momenta p .

the correspondent generating function (m ) is related

to the gauge (di ) generator. we have

m = pi

g
pi  g ,

s = s +z 2

1

dm
d

d ,

(6)

(7)

and the action (4) is invariant under gauge transforma-
tions with the open boundary conditions (5).

it is also possible to obtain a non-zero eective hamil-
tonian function ( h) in reduced phase-space. after gauge
xing a new canonical transformation is performed,
whose generator (f ) is determined by the form of the
gauge xing constraints [4]. we can write

h = (cid:20)ht +

f

 (cid:21)|f ixed .

(8)

we obtain the last equality after (complete) gauge x-
ing, meaning that h is the hamiltonian function for the
new variables, in reduced phase-space. the equations of
motion will be

s = mz ds ,

from which follows the parametrized ( ) lagrangian

l = m(u u)

1

2 ,

(11)

(12)

where the u s are the four-velocities (u   dx
d ). the
metric convention is diag [-1, 1, 1, 1]. as is well known,
the action (11) is di invariant (   ).

the total hamiltonian ht is easily constructed, being
proportional to constraints as expected. the canonical
hamiltonian hc is strongly zero

ht = hc + 11 = 11 .

(13)

the model has only one constraint, which is evidently
rst class (1 = pp + m2). 1 is an arbitrary local
multiplier.

the hamilton-jacobi equations of motion read

dx
d  {x, ht} = 21p
dp
d  {p, ht} = 0 .

(14a)

(14b)

the gauge transformations generated by the rst-class
constraint 1 are analogous to the equations of motion
above since the model is pure gauge

x = {x, g} = {x, 1} = 2p
p = {p, g} = 0 .

(15a)
(15b)

the generating function (m ) is in this case, following

q = { q, h}d

p = { p , h}d ,

the denition (6)

(9)

where d denotes the dirac bracket [5] operation. the
constraints surface in the new variables is given by

{p

g

p  g}2

1 = (p2  m2)|2
1 .

(10)

so, the improved action reads

s = s +

x0
2p0 (p2  m2)|2
1 ,

with the new boundary conditions given by

x (i) = [x 

x0
p0 p](i) i = 1, 2 .

(16)

(17)

(18)

ga( q, p )  ga(cid:2)p ( q, p ), q( q, p )(cid:3)

with analogous expressions for the gauge xing con-
straints (that will turn the weak equalities into strong
ones).

iii. the relativistic particle example

in this section we take the instructive relativistic parti-
cle example to apply the methods described in the prece-
dent section. essentially this analysis was done in [3] and
partially in [4]. here we reproduce some calculations for
pedagogical reasons and also nd correspondent results
when the proper-time gauge xing is considered.

the next step is the reduced phase-space analysis. the

proper-time gauge xing condition is given by

2 = x0 

p0
m

 .

(19)

2

following the standard procedure [5], the dirac brack-
ets for the physical degrees of freedom (the spatial sec-
tor [xi , pi]) are

{xi, xj}d = 0 = {pi, pj}d {xi, pj}d = j
i .

(20)

the gauge xing condition (19) gives the form of the
canonical transformation needed

where r is the 2-d scalar curvature.  and  are scalars
related to a central charge (gravity coupled to matter,
before integration) and to a cosmological constant, re-
spectively ( for details see [2]).

the generator of the local invariances (26) must be a
linear combination of the rst class constraints that arise
from (27) (there are not second class constraints). we
have

p = p
xi = xi
x0 = x0 

p0
m



(21a)
(21b)

(21c)

as a consequence the constraints in the new variables
become

1 = 1

2  0 .

(22)

the generator of the canonical transformation is a
function of old momenta , new positions and time (type
f3, see [7] )

f3 = x p +

(p 0)2
2m

 .

so the hamiltonian in reduced phase-space is

h = h +

f3


=

(p 0)2
2m

,

(23)

(24)

giving the right hamilton-jacobi equations for the
proper-time description

dxi

= {xi, h}d =
= {pi, h}d = 0 .

(25a)

(25b)

iv. the induced 2-d gravity model

in this part we apply the techniques described in sec-
tion ii to a eld theory; of our interest is the 2-d induced
gravity model proposed by polyakov in [2].

we rst want to nd the generator of the local gauge
transformations (di ). the form variations in the elds
are

 = 
g = g  g + g .

(26a)
(26b)

it is possible to write the corresponding action as a local
functional, introducing the auxiliary scalar eld (x) [8]

s = z d2xg(cid:0)2  r + 2(cid:1) ,

(27)

3

1 = 00  0
2 = 01  0 .

(28a)
(28b)

where  are the momenta conjugated to the metric
components g . the time-consistency condition [5] ap-
plied to the primary constraints (28) gives two secondary
constraints

1 =

2 =   2g1111

(29a)

(29b)

and no more constraint generations appear.
in accord
with the discussion of section ii, the di invariance im-
plies into a hamiltonian functional that is proportional
to 1 and 2

hc = 

(30)

following the anderson-bergmann algorithm [6] , the
generators of the gauge transformations (26) must obey
(taking for example the variations of the  scalar eld)

(x) = {(x), g}

= z dy{(x),(cid:16) 1 g0
= 0(cid:18) 2g

= 00(x) + 11(x)

1 + 0 g0

0 + 1 g1 + 0 g0(cid:17)}

(cid:19) (x) + 11(x) ,

(31)

where we have used the denition of momentum 11

11 =



2g (cid:20)  

g01
g11

(cid:21) ,

(32)

to put the time derivatives in hamiltonian form. the g
variables are linear combinations of contraints (29) and
(28). to determine their form we see that g0
0 can
not be proportional to 1 nor to 2 since the  tranfor-
mation has no  term. so, at maximum

1 and g0

1 = a1 + b2

0 = c1 + d2

g0
g0
g1 = e1 + f 2 + l1 + m 2
g0 = h1 + i2 + n 1 + p 2 .

(33a)

(33b)

(33c)

(33d)

comparing with (31) we nd that

e = 0 , f = 1 .

(34)

in a similar way we obtain the 0 contribution and
those from the metric components g (using (26) and
(29)). the nal result is

a = 2g01 n = 0g00 b = g11
c = 2g00
d = g11
l = 1g00

r = 0
t = 0 m = 1g01
f = 1
p = 0g01
i = g01
g11

s = g01

e = 0
g

h =

g11

.

(35)

with the gauge generator g at hand, following the ideas
of section ii, we go for the calculation of the generation
function ( m )

m = z mdy = z dy[p i g

p i  g] .

(36)

after some algebra we obtain straightfowardly

m =

(37a)

the next step is to construct the eective hamiltonian
density after complete gauge xing. we nd rst the
reduced phase-space structure, using the dirac bracket
procedure. we choose as gauge xing constraints

5 = 11  f (t) 6 = 1  1 .

(38)

where f (t) is an arbitrary function of time. to obtain
a more convenient form of the dirac matrix we use the
following linear combinations

1 = 1 + 5
2 = 1  5 ,

whose poisson brackets are

{1(x), 1(y)} = 2x(x  y) .

(39a)
(39b)

(40)

the dirac brackets for the physical degrees of freedom
can be obtained in a two-steps procedure. first we x the
[01-00] sector ( see expressions (28) ) using the light-
cone gauge xing condition [2], this is straightforward.
in a second step we take the remaining set of contraints,
namely 1, 2, 1 and 2. finally we obtain, after a
long calculation,

{g11(x), 11(y)}d = (x  y) ,

(41)

4

the others are zero.
it is important to notice that al-
though the results obtained are the expected expres-
sions (41), the gravitational eld component g11 and
its momentum are not independent quantities, they are
linked by the constraints relations (29).

to nd the eective hamiltonian in reduced phase-
space we perform, as was explained in section ii, a canon-
ical transformation. in the gravity sector we have

11 = 11  f (t)
g11 = g11 .

the new lagrangian density reads

l = l + f  ,

(42a)
(42b)

(43)

where f  is the generator of the canonical transforma-
tion. the correct equations of motion are obtained when

f 0 = 11g11 f 1 = (cid:18)1 

1 + g11

2g11 (cid:19) 1g1111 .

(44)

finally, the eective hamiltonian density is easily com-
puted

hef f = g11 + (cid:18)1 

1 + g11

2g11 (cid:19) 111g11 ,

(45)

and this density rules the dynamics of the gravitational
eld in the reduced phase-space. in fact, this result is in
accord with the time derivative of g11 (obtained from the
denition of momenta and the gauge xing conditions
(38) )

g11(x) = (cid:20)4

g11

2 + 2(cid:18)1 

g11 + 1

2g11 (cid:19) 1g11(cid:21) (x)

.

v. conclusions

the methods developed by henneaux, teitelboim and
vergara, and independently by gitman and tiutyn, oer
a solution to the zero hamiltonian problem (zh prob-
lem) in the 2-d induced gravity case. they permit to
obtain an eective hamiltonian, which rules the evolu-
tion of physical degrees of freedom after complete gauge
xing. the key point is that open boundary conditions
are necessary; the new hamiltonian arises naturally after
a time-dependent canonical transformation is performed
in reduced phase-space.
