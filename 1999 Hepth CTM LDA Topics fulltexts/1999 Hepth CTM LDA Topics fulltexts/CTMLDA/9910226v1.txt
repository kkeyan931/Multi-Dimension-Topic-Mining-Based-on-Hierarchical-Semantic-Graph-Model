1 introduction

the conformal eld theory (cft) is a theory which is invariant under the conformal
transformation. cft in 2 dimensions [1] can be applied to the string theory as a world-
sheet theory and statistical critical phenomena in 2 dimensional space. this theory has
made a remarkable progress contacting with various branches of mathematics [2, 3]. the
main reason is that in two dimensional space (or 1+1 dimensional spacetime), the group
of conformal transformations is innite dimensional. its algebra is known as the virasoro
algebra in the eld theory realization, and this symmetry is very powerful. by using its
detailed representation theory one can determine the spectrum and even calculate cor-
relation functions. statistical critical phenomena in 2 dimensional space are understood
systematically by cft and the list of critical exponents is obtained by the representation
theory of the virasoro algebra. in the rst superstring revolution (middle 80s), the string
theory was regarded as cft on a worldsheet, and the knowledge obtained in the study
of cft developed string theories very much. recent progress in string theory (the sec-
ond superstring revolution (middle 90s)) is based on spacetime symmetry consideration,
e.g., duality, d-brane, and also ads/cft correspondence, but importance of worldsheet
symmetries remains unchanged.

quantum eld theory and critical phenomena are the systems with innite degrees
of freedom. consequently they are dicult to treat. however we can sometimes solve
some models, so-called solvable models. here we loosely use the word solvable if some
physical quantities of that model can be calculated exactly, for example, 2d ising model,
xyz spin chain, solvable lattice model, cft, 4d super yang-mills theory, etc. although
solvable models themselves are interesting for us, a main purpose for physicists to study
solvable models is to create new idea and concept and to develop them through the study
of solvable models. physics should explain the real world. the matter in the real world is
very complicated and we need some approximations to study it. an approximation is not
a bad thing if it grasps the essence of the problem. physicists have developed a variety
of concepts, approximation methods, calculation techniques, etc. through the study of
solvable models, in order to apply them to the real world.

symmetry is one of the main idea of modern physics. if the model has some symmetry,
its analysis becomes much simpler by using the representation theory of the symmetry
algebra. by reversing this direction, symmetry is also used for a model building. for
example, the general relativity and the gauge theory are constructed by imposing the
invariance under the general coordinate transformation and the gauge transformation
respectively. from symmetry point of view, solvable in the system with innite degrees

of freedom is stated as the following equation:

system of innite degrees of freedom

innite dimensional symmetry

= system can be described by nite degrees of freedom.

(1.1)

this is the reason why we are interested in innite dimensional symmetries.

common feature of many solvable models is the factorization of the scattering s
matrix [4], in other words the yang-baxter equation [5, 6, 7]. solutions of the yang-
baxter equation are related to the lie algebras [8, 9, 10], and three types of solutions
are known; rational, trigonometric and elliptic. associated for each type of solution (r
matrix), algebras are dened [11],

 yangian,

rational
trigonometric  quantum group (quantum algebra),
elliptic

 elliptic quantum group (elliptic algebra).

this elliptic algebra is one of the topics in this lecture.

since cft is invariant under the scale transformation, cft has no scale, in other
words, it is a massless theory.
if we add to cft the perturbation which breaks the
conformal symmetry, then the theory becomes massive. general massive theories are
very dicult. so we restrict ourselves to its subset, massive integrable models (mim).
if we perturb cft in a good manner (for example (1, 3) or (1, 2) perturbation [12, 13,
14, 15]), innitely many conserved quantities survive. in the terminology of statistical
mechanics, cft corresponds to on-critical theory, and perturbation corresponds to o-
critical procedure, and a lattice analogue of mim is a solvable lattice model. cft is
controlled by the virasoro symmetry, but mim is massive, therefore there is no virasoro
symmetry.

a natural question arises:

what symmetry ensures the integrability or innitely many conserved quan-
tities of mim or solvable lattice model ?

we would like to answer this question. this is our main motivation for recent study.

in some cases the yangian or the quantum group symmetry plays an important role.
kyoto group investigated the xxz spin chain and claried its symmetry, the quantum

5

ane lie algebra uq(bsl2) [16]. they studied xxz spin chain from the representation

theory point of view and developed vertex operator calculation technique. but naively
one expected some deformation of the virasoro algebra. such algebras, deformed virasoro
algebra (dva) and deformed wn algebras (dwa), were constructed in dierent points
of view [17, 18, 19, 20], using a correspondence of singular vectors and multivariable
orthogonal symmetric polynomials or using the wakimoto realization at the critical level.
later it was shown that this deformed virasoro algebra appears in the andrews-baxter-
forester (abf) model as a symmetry [21]. this dva corresponds to a(1)
1 algebra. dva
corresponding to a(2)

2 was obtained in [22].

another possibility is elliptic quantum groups (elliptic algebras). corresponding to the
two types of elliptic solutions of the yang-baxter equation, there are two type of elliptic
quantum groups [23, 24]. these two elliptic quantum groups have a common structure
[25]; they are quasi-hopf algebras [11]. along this line, explicit formulas for the twistors

were dened in [26].

were presented and the vertex type algebra aq,p(bsln) and the face type algebra bq,(g)

in this lecture we would like to (i) introduce the deformed virasoro algebras and
elliptic algebras, (ii) present free eld approach and vertex operator calculation technique
for the solvable lattice models. contents of this lecture is presented in previous pages.
in section 2 we review the virasoro algebra which is needed to understand the deformed
case. the deformed virasoro algebra of type a(1)
is dened and its properties are given
1
in section 3.
in section 4 we review solvable lattice models and introduce the elliptic
quantum groups. section 5 is devoted to an application of these idea to the abf model.
abf model in regime iii corresponds to the (1, 3)-perturbation of the minimal unitary
cft. vertex operators are bosonized and local height probabilities (lhps) are calculated.
another deformed virasoro algebra dva(a(2)
2 ) is dened in section 6 and the dilute al
models are studied by free eld approach. dilute al model in regime 2+ corresponds to
the (1, 2)-perturbation of the minimal unitary cft. in section 7 we mention other topics
that are not treated in this lecture. appendix a is a summary of notations and formulas
used throughout this lecture.

2 conformal field theory and virasoro algebra

2.1 conformal eld theory

the conformal eld theory (cft) is a theory which is invariant under the conformal
transformation. in two dimensional space (or 1+1 dimensional spacetime) the conformal
transformation is any holomorphic map z 7 w = w(z) where z is a complex coordinate
of the space. therefore the conformal group is innite dimensional.

6

an important property of the cft (bulk theory) is the factorization into a holomorphic
part (z, left mover) and an antiholomorphic part (z, right mover). we can treat them
independently. usually we treat z part (chiral part) only. to get nal physical quantities,
however, we have to glue chiral and antichiral parts with appropriate physical conditions.

as a quantum eld theory, innitesimal conformal transformation,

ln : z 7 z + zn+1,

(2.1)

is generated by the chiral part of the energy momentum tensor, l(z). the algebra gener-
ated by this l(z) is called the virasoro algebra. invariance under the conformal transfor-
mation imposes that correlation functions satisfy the conformal ward identity. correlation
functions are severely controlled by this innite dimensional virasoro symmetry.

general review of the cft is not the aim of this lecture. since many good review and

books are available now, for various topics of the cft, see [1, 2, 3].

2.2 virasoro algebra

in this and next subsections we review some properties of the virasoro algebra in order
to compare them with the deformed one in the next section.

2.2.1 denition and consistency

denition the virasoro algebra is a lie algebra over c generated by ln (n  z) and
c, and their relation is

[ln, lm] = (n  m)ln+m +

c
12

in terms of the virasoro current l(z) = xnz

following operator product expansion (ope),

(n3  n)n+m,0,
lnzn2, this relation is equivalent to the

[ln, c] = 0.

(2.2)

as a formal power series this can be written as

c

2l(w)

l(w)
z  w

1

+ reg.

l(z)l(w) =

[l(z), l(w)] =

z(cid:17) c
z(cid:17)2l(w) +
z(cid:17)l(w),

[z2l(z), w2l(w)] =(cid:16)w
z(cid:17)2

in (2.5) gives (2.2).

zn (see appendix a.2). meaning of (2.5) is that the coecient of znwm

consistency mathematically the virasoro algebra is a one dimensional central exten-
sion of di(s1), lie algebra of dieomorphism group of a circle s1. vector elds on s1
form a lie algebra,

[ln, lm] = (n  m)ln+m,

(2.6)

where ln = zn+1 d
extension,

dz = iein d

d (z = ei is a coordinate of s1). let us consider its central

[ln, lm] = (n  m)ln+m + cf (n, m),

(2.7)

where c is a central element and f (n, m) is a number. from antisymmetry of bracket [ , ]
and the jacobi identity, f (n, m) should satisfy

f (n, m) = f (m, n),
(n  m)f (l, n + m) + (m  l)f (n, m + l) + (l  n)f (m, l + n) = 0.

(2.8)

(2.9)

its nontrivial solution has the following form,

f (n, m) = const  n3n+m,0.

(2.10)

proof. from (2.9) with l = 0, we have f (n, m) = nm
satises eqs.(2.8,2.9) with n + m + l 6= 0. by setting ln = ln + c
l0 = l0, (2.7) becomes

n+mf (n + m, 0) for n + m 6= 0, which
n f (n, 0) (n 6= 0) and

[ln, lm] = (n  m)ln+m + cn+m,0f (n,n).

hence we are enough to determine an = f (n,n). eq.(2.9) with l = n  m implies

(n  m)an+m + (2m + n)an  (2n + m)am = 0.

for m = 1, we obtain

an = 1

6 (n3  n)a2 + (n  1

6(n3  n))a1,

and this solution satises eqs.(2.8, 2.9) for all cases. the term proportional to n in an,
say bn, can be deleted by ln = ln + c

2bn,0.

the central term in virasoro algebra is chosen so that it vanishes for n = 1, 0,1.

2.2.2 representation theory

we consider the highest representation of the virasoro algebra. the highest weight state
|hi (h  c) is characterized by

ln|hi = 0 (n > 0),
8

l0|hi = h|hi,

(2.11)

and the verma module is

m =ml0 mn1nl>0

cln1    lnl|hi.

(2.12)

descendant ln1    lnl|hi is also an eigenstate of l0 with eigenvalue h+
called a level of the state. since l0 corresponds to energy (exactly speaking hamiltonian
is l0 + l0), this representation has energy bounded below. the highest weight state
|hi is created by a primary eld with conformal weight h, h(z), from the vacuum |0i
(ln|0i = 0 for n  1); |hi = lim
z0

at level n there are p(n) independent states, ln1    lnl|i (n1      nl > 0,
ni = n). here p(n) is the number of partition and its generating function is given by

h(z)|0i.

ni is

ni.

lxi=1

lxi=1

lxi=1

p(n)yn =

xn =0

yn=1

1

1  yn .

(2.13)

let us number these states by the reverse lexicographic ordering for (n1,   , nl), i.e.,
|h; n, 1i = ln|i, |h; n, 2i = ln +1l1|i,   , |h; n, p(n)i = ln

the rst problem of representation theory is whether m is irreducible or not, namely
m has virasoro invariant subspaces or not. if m has a singular vector at level n, |i,
which is dened by

1|i.

ln|i = 0

(n > 0),

l0|i = (h + n)|i,

(2.14)

then |i generates an invariant subspace and we have to quotient out it from m in
order to get an irreducible module l. existence of singular vectors can be detected
by considering an inner product (bilinear form). let introduce dual module m on
which the virasoro algebra act as ln = ln. m is generated by hh| which satises
hh|ln = 0 (n < 0), hh|l0 = hhh| and hh|hi = 1. at level n there are p(n) states
hh; n, 1| = hh|ln , hh; n, 2| = hh|l1ln1,   , hh; n, p(n)| = hh|ln
1 . a state |i  m
is called a null state if it is orthogonal to all states, i.e., h|i = 0 for h|  m.
descendants of |i are null state, because (i) hh|i = 0 (consider hh|l0|i) and (ii)

hh|    lm2lm1  ln1ln2   |i =p(  )hh|i = 0. physical meaning of quotienting out

invariant subspaces is projecting out null states which decouple from all the states.

we give an example of inner product at level 1, 2, 3.

a determinant of this matrix is called the kac determinant and its zeros indicate existence
of null states. the kac determinant at level 2 is 2h(16h2 + 2(c  5)h + c) which vanishes
for h = 0 and h = h = 1
1|hi is a null state
which is a descendant of the singular vector at level 1 l1|hi. for h = h, there exists a

these  and 0 will be used throughout this lecture. remark that c and hl,k are invariant
under   1.

detailed study of the kac determinant shows that representations of the virasoro
algebra are classied into several classes. the most interesting class is so-called minimal
series [1]. in minimal series  is a rational number (we take  > 1.),

p, p  z>0,

(p, p) = 1,

an operator algebra of h(z) closes for the following nite number of h = hl,k,

1  l  p  1,

1  k  p  1,

pl  pk > 0.

(2.23)

if one prefers 0 <  < 1, it is achieved by p  p (  1), and then hl,k  hk,l.

let denote the verma module with h = hl,k as ml,k. from the kac determinant and

the property of hl,k,

hl,k = hl,k = hl+pn,k+pn
hl,k = hl,k + lk,

(n  z),

(2.24)

(2.25)

there are two basic singular vectors in ml,k. one is at level lk (hl,k = hl,k + lk, hl,k =
hl,k) and the other is at level (p  l)(p  k) (hl,k = hpl,pk, hp+l,pk = hl,k + (p 
l)(p  k), hp+l,pk = hl+2p,k). therefore we have

ml,k  (ml+2p,k  ml,k).

(2.26)

to get an irreducible module we have to factor out invariant subspace, ml,k/(ml+2p,k 
ml,k). but the story has not ended yet because ml+2p,k  ml,k does not coincide with
ml+2p,k  ml,k.

from the kac determinant, ml,k also has two singular vectors,
ml,k = mpl,p+k  mp+l,p+k = ml2p,k
= mp+l,pk  mpl,pk = ml+2p,k.

here indices (p  l, p + k) and (p + l, p  k) are positive and minimal with respect to
translation of (p, p) (see (2.24)). similarly

ml+2p,k = m2pl,k  m2p+l,k = ml2p,k
= ml,2pk  ml,2pk = ml+2p,k.

these submodules of ml+2p,k and ml,k coincide, because if they do not coincide it
implies more zeros of the kac determinant. therefore ml+2p,k and ml,k share two
invariant submodules and we have

ml,k  ml+2p,k = (ml,k  ml+2p,k)/(ml2p,k  ml+2p,k).

2.2.3 primary elds and correlation functions

primary elds are fundamental elds in cft. under the conformal transformation, a
primary eld with the conformal weight h, h(z), transforms as a rank h form (h(z)dzh).
we have the ope,

l(z)h(w) =

hh(w)

(z  w)2 +

h(w)
z  w

+ reg.,

[ln, h,m] =(cid:16)(h  1)n  m(cid:17)h,n+m,

or in mode

where h(z) = xnzh

h,nznh. (h(z) is called a quasiprimary eld if (2.43) holds for

n = 1, 0,1.) we remark that the zero mode of a h = 1 eld commutes with the virasoro
algebra, [ln, 1,0] = 0.

states are created by elds from the vacuum, |i = lim
z0

(z)|0i, and they are one-
to-one correspondence. the highest weight state corresponds to the primary eld and
descendant states correspond to secondary elds. for example,

(2.42)

(2.43)

(2.44)

where ln is

|hi  h(z),
l1|hi  h(z),

l3l2|hi  l3 l2h(z),
ln(z) =iz

(y  z)1nl(y)(z).

dy
2i

in quantum eld theory physical information is obtained from the green functions
(correlation functions). in cft conformal symmetry imposes that correlation functions
obey the conformal ward identity [1], which enables us to reduce calculation of correlation
function of secondary elds to that of primary elds. moreover if null states exist, the
correlation functions satisfy dierential equations [1]. we illustrate this by taking an
example. for h = h1,2 or h2,1, from (2.15), we have a null eld

(z) =(cid:16) l2 

3

2(2h + 1)

l2

1(cid:17)h(z).

(2.45)

since a null eld decouples from all the elds, correlation functions including it vanish,

0 = h(z)xi

= (cid:16)l2(z) 
=   nxi=1(cid:16)

(2.46)

z!hh(z)xi,

2

3

2(2h + 1)

where x = h1(z)   hn (z). here we have used

(y  z)1nhl(y)h(z)xi
hi

(y  z)1n(cid:16)

(y  zi)2hh(z)xi +

(n  1)

(2.47)

(2.48)

due to translational invariance, we have l1(z) = z. by solving this dierential equation
the correlation function can be calculated. another method for calculation of correlation
functions is free eld realization, see [30, 2].

2.3 free eld realization

in the previous subsection the virasoro algebra is treated in abstract way. in this subsec-
tion we treat it more explicitly by using our familiar free boson.

2.3.1 free eld realization

let us introduce free boson oscillator an (n  z6=0) and zero mode a0, q,

[an, am] = 2nn+m,

[an, q] = 2n,0.

(2.49)

here 2 is the cartan matrix of a1 lie algebra. the fock space with momentum , f, is
dened by

f =ml0 mn1nl>0

can1    anl|ib,

where |ib is characterized by

an|ib = 0 (n > 0),

a0|ib = |ib.

|ib is obtained from |0ib (an|0ib = 0 for n  0),

|ib = e

1

2 q|0ib.

a boson eld (z) is

(2.50)

(2.51)

(2.52)

(z) = q + a0 log z xn6=0

1
n

anzn,

(z) =xnz

anzn1.

(2.53)

14

((z) here and usual one used in string theory is related as (z) = i2string(z). q here
is antihermitian.) normal ordering prescription :

: is dened by

( move an(n > 0) and a0

move an(n < 0) and q to left.

to right,

the virasoro algebra is realized by a free boson in the following way,

l(z) =

1
4

: (z)(z) : +

1
2

02(z),

where the back ground charge 0 is given in (2.19). in mode it is

ln =

1
4

:xm

anmam : 

1
2

0(n + 1)an,

or more explicitly,

ln =

l0 =

1

4 xm6=0,n
2xm>0

1

anmam +

2

ana0

0(n + 1)an

(n 6= 0),

amam +

1

4(cid:16)(a0  0)2  2
0(cid:17).

(2.54)

(2.55)

(2.56)

(2.57)

(2.58)

this virasoro current realizes the virasoro algebra with the central charge (2.17). |ib is
the highest weight state of the virasoro algebra with the conformal weight h = h(),

|ib = |h()i,
h() =

1

4(cid:16)(  0)2  2
0(cid:17),

and the corresponding primary eld is

v(z) = : e

1

2 (z) : .

due to the background charge 0, (z) is not a primary eld,

[ln, am] = man+m  0n(n + 1)n+m,0.

(2.59)

(2.60)

(2.61)

(2.62)

the dual fock space f also has the virasoro module structure by the pairing < , >

: f  f  c,

< taf, v > = < f, av >,

f  f, v  f, a : operator.

here tln and tan are given by

tln = ln,
tan = an
ta0 = a0 + 20,

(n 6= 0),

15

(2.63)

(2.64)

(2.65)

(2.66)

and

we write the following pairings as in the last lines,

< |ib,|ib >= 1.

< tlm1    tlmk|ib, ln1    lnl|ib >
= < |ib, lmk    lm1ln1    lnl|ib >
=: bh|lmk    lm1ln1    lnl|ib,

< tam1    tamk|ib, an1    anl|ib >
= < |ib, amk    am1an1    anl|ib >
=: bh|amk    am1an1    anl|ib.

by (2.65) and (2.66), f is isomorphic to f20 as a virasoro module,

f = f20
|ib  |20  ib.

(vir. module).

of course h() = h(20  ) by (2.60).

for later use we dene a0 by,

a0 = a0  0,

a0|ib = (  0)|ib,

ta0 = a0.

the virasoro current (2.55) can be rewritten as

z2l(z) =

1
4

: d(z)d(z) : +

1
2

0d2(z),

where (z) and d are

(z) = (z)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)a0a0

,

(z) = (z) + 0z1,

d = z


z

.

2.3.2 singular vectors and kac determinant

(2.67)

(2.68)

(2.69)

(2.70)

(2.71)

(2.72)

(2.73)

(2.74)

(2.75)

in the case of h = hl,k there are singular vectors. in the free boson realization they can
be expressed by using the screening currents. screening currents s(z) are primary elds
with h = 1,

s(z) = v2

.

(2.76)

hence their zero modes (screening charge) commute with the virasoro algebra,

= : e(z) :, + =p,  = 1
hln,i0

s(z)i = 0.



dz
2i

16

(2.77)

we will use s+(z) in what follows. s(z) can be treated similarly. we follow the method
in [31].

the representation with h = hl,k is realized on fl,k,

hl,k = h(l,k),

l,k = p(1  l) 

1


(1  k).

(2.78)

(2.79)

in the following we write fl,k = fl,k. to contact with our previous paper [32](r,s there
is  r,s here.), we consider dual space fl,k = fl,k.
in the verma module with
hl,k = hl,k, the singular vector at level lk is expressed as

|l,ki
dzj
2i  s+(z1)   s+(zl)|l,kib

= z
= z

lyj=1
lyj=1

(2.80)

dzj  y1i<jl

(zi  zj)2 

z(1l)k
i

lyi=1



lyj=1

exp(cid:16)pxn>0

1
n

anzn

j(cid:17)  |l,kib.

here dzj is given in (a.14) and the integration contour is summarized in appendixa.4
(for example take ibm p ). since this integral of s+s, which is a map from fl,k to fl,k,
commutes with ln, |l,ki is annihilated by ln (n > 0). this state |l,ki is non zero
because of (a.48).

to prove the kac determinant formula, we rst study the relation between states in

the verma module and fock space. let us introduce following notation,

i = {n1,   , nl}, n1      nl > 0,
li = lnl    ln1, li = ln1    lnl,
ai = anl    an1,

ai = an1    anl,

(i) = l,

(2.81)

(2.82)

(2.83)

and i is ordered by the reverse lexicographic ordering. states at level n in the verma
module are linear combinations of those of fock space,

li|ib =xj

c(n, )i,jaj|ib.

(2.84)

for example,

  l2|ib

2(cid:17)p(nlk)

.

here we have used (a.30). in the last paragraph we have constructed singular vectors as
same number as this order of .

next we consider a dual f. with the notation,

(tl)i = t(li) = tln1    tlnl,
(ta)i = t(ai) = tan1    tanl,

we dene a matrix c(n, ),

c(n, )i,j(ta)j|ib.

by (2.64) and (2.65), the left and right hand sides of this equation are

(tl)i|ib =xj
lhs = li|ib =xk
rhs =xj,k

c(n, 20  )i,kak|ib,

c(n, )i,jdj,kak|ib,

where matrix d is

hence c can be expressed by c,

dj,k = j,k(1)(j).

c(n, )i,j =xk

c(n, 20  )i,kdk,j,

and its determinant is

det c(n, )i,j = det c(n, 20  )  det d

where (m1,   , mk) = 1k12k2   . by using (a.28) and (a.30), its determinant becomes
(2.96)

.

therefore we obtain the kac determinant (2.16),

dethh|lilj|hi = det c(n, )  det g  det tc(n, )

lkn(cid:16)2lk(h  hl,k)(cid:17)p(nlk)

2.3.3 felder complex

irreducible virasoro module ll,k is realized on the fock space fl,k, but this fl,k is bigger
than ll,k. so we have to discuss how ll,k is obtained from fl,k. the virasoro structure
of fl,k was investigated by feigin-fuchs [33] and felder [34]. here we review it following
[34]. we consider minimal series eqs.(2.20)-(2.23).

(a.32) and (a.33) become

(i) m  0 (mod p),

(ii) m  l (mod p).

for example ql is well dened on fl,k (l  l ( mod p)), and the contour can be deformed
to if type by (a.47). importance property of the brst charge is commutativity with
the virasoro algebra,

ql : fl,k  fl2l,k,
qpl : fl,k  fl2(pl),k,

l  l (mod p),

[ln, ql] = 0,

l  l (mod p),

[ln, qpl] = 0,

and the nilpotency,

qlqpl = qplql = qp = 0.

(2.100)

(2.101)

(2.102)

here qlqpl = qp and qplql = qp are shown by ibm p type contour, and qp = 0 is
shown by (a.47). the singular vector (2.80) can be written as |l,ki = ql|l,kib.

v0, um, wm1, vm, vm (m  1) have the same conformal weight as s0, s2m1, s2m1, s2m,
s2m in (2.27) respectively. s2m1 is um but s2m1 vanishes on the fock space. at the level
of s2m1, there is a state which does not belong the verma module. that state is wm1.
we write states in cj with superx (j). conformal weights of v, u, w are following:

in this subsection we review the relation between the virasoro singular vector and the
calogero-sutherland model (csm) [35, 32]. calogero-sutherland model is a many body
quantum mechanical system on a circle with length l under the 1/r2 potential.

where qj is a coordinate of j-th particle, pj is its momentum, n0 is a number of particles, m

the jack symmetric polynomial j = j(x; ) is uniquely determined by the following
two conditions [37, 36],

(i) j(x) =x

(ii)

hj, ji = 0 if  6= .

therefore excited states of calogero-sutherland model are described by the jack sym-
metric polynomials. using properties of the jack symmetric polynomial, some dynamical
correlation functions were calculated [38].

proportional,

let us introduce two transformations for symmetric polynomials,

lyj=1

xk  f (x1,   , xl),

dxj  (x, x) (x)f (x1,   , xl),

then the jack symmetric polynomial satises the following two properties,

(l variables),

j(kl)+ = gkj
j = hj, ji

(j in lhs : l variables)

(2.175)

(2.176)

(2.177)

(2.178)

(2.179)

by successive action of these two transformations to j(x) = 1, an integral representation
of the jack symmetric polynomial can be obtained [35, 32],

j(x)  nl,l1gk1nl1,l2gk2   nln2,ln1gkn1nln1,0  1,

(2.180)

where the partition  is  = ((l1)k1, (l2)k2,   , (ln1)kn1) , namely corresponds to the
following young diagram,

(2.181)

we will show the relation between the jack symmetric polynomials and the virasoro
singular vectors [32]. states in the fock space and symmetric polynomials have one-to-one
correspondence,

namely oscillator an and power sum pn correspond as,
2n


an  pn,

an 


pn

.

(2.183)

using this correspondence, hamiltonian h (2.162), which is a dierential operator with
respect to xj (or pn), is bosonized,

hh| exp(cid:16) 1

2pxn>0

anpn(cid:17) h.

(2.184)

(2.185)

bosonized hamiltonian h is an operator on f. it is cubic in an and can be rewritten
by using the virasoro generator ln (2.56),
anan(cid:16)(1  )n + n0(cid:17)

(anmanam + 2anaman+m) + 1

h = 1

4p xn,m>0

when h acts on the singular vector (2.80), the rst term of h vanishes because of the
property of singular vector, and the second term is already diagonal,

h|l,ki = lk(cid:16)n0 +   1 pl,k(cid:17)|l,ki = ,(kl)|l,ki.

(2.186)
therefore |l,ki is an eigenstate of h, i.e., it gives the jack symmetric polynomial by
the map (2.182). in fact the polynomial obtained from (2.80) by (2.182) agrees with the
integral representation of the jack symmetric polynomial with the partition (kl), (2.181).
the jack symmetric polynomial with general partition whose young diagram is com-

posed of n  1 rectangles is related to the singular vector of wn algebra [32].

3.1 denition and consistency

denition deformed virasoro algebra(dva) (a(1)
type) is an associative algebra over

c generated by tn (n  z) with two parameters x and r, and their relation is [17] (see
(3.128) for correspondence of parameters)

.

28

here we have used the notation (a.1), (a.3). by introducing dva current t (z) =

tnzn, the above relation can be written as a formal power series,

xnz

f ( w

z )t (z)t (w)  t (w)t (z)f ( z

for later use we add a grading operator d,

w ) = (x  x1)[r]x[r  1]x(cid:16)(x2 w

z )(cid:17).
z )  (x2 w

the above relation (3.1) is invariant under

[d, tn] = ntn.

it is also invariant under the following two transformations:

tn 7 tn.

 : x 7 x1,

(i)
(ii)  : x 7 x,

r 7 r,
r 7 1  r.

in the case of (i) f (z) is understood as the rst line of (3.2). let us introduce  as

consistency in subsection 2.2.1 the central term of the virasoro algebra is determined
by the jacobi identity. here we will show that the structure function f (z) is determined
by associativity [39].

let us consider the following relation,

f ( w

z )t (z)t (w)  t (w)t (z)f ( z

w ) = c0(cid:16)(x2 w

z )(cid:17),
z )  (x2 w

(3.11)

where c0 is a normalization constant and x is a parameter, and f (z) is an unknown taylor

series f (z) =

to f ( z1

)f ( z1

(213)  (231)  (321)



.

29

these two results should agree. so we obtain an equation containing delta functions,

c0t (z1)(cid:16)(x2 z3
g(z) = f (z)f (x2z)  f (z1)f (x2z1) = g(x2z1).
in mode expansion g(z) =xnz
(x2n  x2m)gn+m + (x2m  x2l)gm+l + (x2l  x2n)gl+n = 0,
gn = x2ngn.

gnzn, this equation becomes

)g( z3
z1

z2

from (3.16), we have g0 = 0. from (3.15) with (m, l) = (n1, 1n), (m, l) = (n2, 2n),
we have g2n1 = 1x2(2n1)
g2. and from (3.15) with (m, l) =
(n  1, n + 1) we have g2 = (1 + x2)g1. combining these we get gn = (1  x2n)g1 and
this satises both (3.15) and (3.16). therefore the solution is

g1 and g2n2 = 1x2(2n2)

1x2

1x4

where c0 is a constant. by setting f (z) = f (z)f (x2z), (3.14) and (3.17) become

g(z) = c0(cid:16)(z)  (x2z)(cid:17),
(1  x2n)zn.

gn = c0(1  x2n),
f (z)  f (x2z1) = c0xnz
f (z) = c0(cid:16) +xn>0

(1  x2n)zn(cid:17),

since f (z) is also a taylor series, this equation implies

where a new parameter  has appeared. if we express this  by a new parameter r as

 =

x  x1

(xr  xr)(xr1  x(r1))

,

then f (z) becomes

f (z) = c0

(1  x2rz)(1  x2(r1))

.

(1  z)(1  x2z)

from this equation f (z) is calculated as (|x| < 1)
f (x4z)

(cid:17).

we choose the normalization of f (z) as f (0) = 1 (c0 = 1), then this f (z) is just (3.2).
we x the normalization of t (z) by c0 = 1.

3.2 conformal limit

quantum group(algebra) uq(g) is a deformation of u(g) and it reduces to undeformed
one in the q  1 limit,

uq(g)

q1 u(g).

the deformed virasoro algebra dened in the previous subsection is a deformation of the
virasoro algebra as expected from its name. then in what limit it reduces to the usual
virasoro algebra?

dva ?? vir.

since dva contains two parameters x and r (or  (3.8)), it admits various limits[39]. in
this subsection we will show that dva reduces to the virasoro algebra in the conformal
limit.

the conformal limit is

x  1,

r (or ) : xed.

(3.23)

to study this limit we write x as

(3.24)
where 0 is given in (2.19) and  is a ctitious plank constant, and take   0. f (z) has
the expansion,

x = e 1

2 0,

taking into account the invariance under (3.6), we assume the expansion

f (z) = 1 + 2f [2](z) + 4f [4](z) +    .

t (z) = 2 + 2t [2](z) + 4t [4](z) + 6t [6](z) +    ,

(remark that t (z) is also a solution.) and we set
t [2](z) = z2l(z) + 1

then lhs of (3.3) is

(3.29)

comparing these equations and (2.5) shows that l(z) in (3.27) is the virasoro current
with the central charge (2.17).

therefore the virasoro current l(z) is found in 2 term of the dva current t (z).
and also (conformal)spin 4 current t [4](z), spin 6 current t [6](z),    exist in the dva
current. in massless case only one virasoro current l(z) controls (chiral part of)cft. in
massive case, however, l(z) and innitely many higher spin currents t [2n](z) are needed
to control massive theory, and they gather and form the dva current t (z). dva current
is a dressed virasoro current.

3.3 representation theory

let us consider the highest weight representation. the highest weight state |i (  c)
is characterized by

and the verma module is

tn|i = 0

(n > 0),

t0|i = |i,

m =ml0 mn1nl>0

ctn1    tnl|i.

(3.30)

(3.31)

m is a graded module with grading d,

d  tn1    tnl|i =(cid:16)d +

lxi=1

nl(cid:17)tn1    tnl|i,

d|i = d|i (d  c),

and we callpl

i=1 nl as a level.

to obtain the irreducible module from the verma module we have to quotient out
invariant submodules, which are generated by singular vectors. singular vector at level
n, |i, is

tn|i = 0 (n > 0), t0|i = |i,

d|i = (d + n)|i,

(3.32)

where  is some eigenvalue. existence of singular vectors is detected by zeros of the
kac determinant. to dene the kac determinant let us introduce the dual module m
on which the dva act as t n = tn. m is generated by h| which satises h|tn = 0
(n < 0), h|t0 = h| and h|i = 1. at level n there are p(n) states |; n, 1i =
tn|i, |; n, 2i = tn +1t1|i,   , |; n, p(n)i = t n
1|i in m, and h; n, 1| = h|tn ,
in m.
h; n, 2| = h|t1tn1,   , h; n, p(n)| = h|t n
the kac determinant at level n is given by [17, 40]

1

deth; n, i|; n, ji = yl,k1

lkn(cid:18)(xrl  xrl)(x(r1)l  x(r1)l)

xl + xl

(2  2

l,k)(cid:19)p(nlk)

,

(3.33)

32

where l,k is

l,k = xrl(r1)k + xrl+(r1)k.

(3.34)

 dependence appears through 2 because of the symmetry (3.5). conformal limit (3.23)
of this determinant is

lkn(cid:16) 2l2
2  2(h  hl,k)  4(cid:17)p(nlk)
yl,k1
lkn(cid:16)2lk(h  hl,k)(cid:17)p(nlk)
= a yl,k1

+    ,

+    , a = 4xl,k1

lkn

p(n  lk).

(3.35)

this is just the kac determinant of the virasoro algebra (2.16), and the order of  is
consistent with (3.26) (use (a.30)).

for generic values of x and r, this kac determinant (3.33) has essentially the same
structure as the virasoro one (2.16). therefore embedding pattern is same as (2.27),
and the character which counts the degeneracy at each level (tr qd) is also the same. for
special value of x and r, for example xr is a root of unity, the kac determinant has more
zeros. in this case we need special study, see [40].

3.4 free eld realization

3.4.1 free eld realization

let us introduce free boson oscillator hn (n  z6=0),

n

[n]x[rn]x[(r  1)n]x

[2n]x

n+m,0,

(3.36)

and use zero mode a0 and q dened in (2.49) (or a0 in (2.72)). the fock space f is
dened by

f =ml0 mn1nl>0

chn1    hnl|ib,

(3.37)

where |ib is given by (2.51) with replacing an by hn.

the dva current t (z) is realized as follows:

t (z) = +(z) + (z),

(z) = : exp(cid:16)xn6=0

hn(x1z)n(cid:17) : xr(r1)a0.

to prove this we need the ope formula,

f ( w

where c and hl,k are given by (2.17) and (2.18) respectively.
|ib is the highest weight state of dva with  = (),

|ib = |()i,
() = xr(r1)(0) + xr(r1)(0).

the dual space f becomes a dva module by (2.63) with

ttn = tn,
thn = hn,

eq.(2.66),

and (2.67). by (3.48), f is isomorphic to f20 as dva module,

f = f20

(dva module).

(3.47)

(3.48)

(3.49)

(3.50)

remark that () = (20  ) by (3.46).

in the conformal limit (3.23), oscillator hn is expressed by an in (2.49) as follows:



2s 2

xn + xn

hn =

xrn  xrn

rn0

x(r1)n  x(r1)n

(r  1)n0

an.

(3.51)

substituting this expression into (3.38) and expanding in , we get (3.26) with l(z) in
(2.55) (or (2.73)).

34

3.4.2 singular vectors and kac determinant

in the case of  = l,k there are singular vectors. in the free boson realization they can
be expressed by using the screening currents. for later convenience we denote screening
currents as x(z). x(z) is dened by

x+(z) = : exp(cid:16)xn6=0
x(z) = : exp(cid:16)xn6=0

conformal limit (3.23) of x(z) is zs(z) in (2.76) and that of x+(z) is zs+(z) (up to
phase) due to (1)n factor in (3.54).

commutation relation of dva generator and screening currents is a total dierence

[tn, x+(w)] = (xr  xr)(cid:16)(xr1w)na+(xr1w)  (x(r1)w)na+(x(r1)w)(cid:17),(3.55)
[tn, x(w)] = (xr1  x(r1))(cid:16)(xrw)na(xrw)  (xrw)na(xrw)(cid:17),

(3.56)

where a(w) is

a+(w) = xr : (w)x+(x(r1)w) :,
a(w) = x(r1) : (w)x(xrw) : .

hence their zero modes (screening charge) commute with dva,

x(z)i = 0.

(3.57)

(3.58)

(3.59)

(exactly speaking we have to specify the fock space on which they act. see subsection
3.4.3.) we will use x+(z) in what follows. x(z) can be treated similarly.

the representation with  = l,k is realized on fl,k = fl,k,

l,k = (l,k),

(3.60)

where l,k is given in (2.79). to contact with our previous paper [17, 18] (r,s there is
 r,s here.), we consider dual space fl,k = fl,k. like as the virasoro case (2.80),
singular vectors of dva are expressed by product of screening charges. moreover this
product becomes more clear for the deformed case, if we include lukyanovs zero mode

35

factor (see subsection 3.4.3). in the verma module with l,k, the singular vector at
level lk is expressed as

|l,ki = ql|l,kib

(3.62)

here we have used the notation (a.6) with r = r  1 and zi = x2ui. since the brst
charge ql, which is a map from fl,k to fl,k, commutes with tn, |l,ki is annihilated
by tn (n > 0). this state |l,ki is non zero because its conformal limit gives non zero
state (2.80).

like as in subsection 2.3.2 let us introduce matrices c(n, ) and c(n, ),

c can be expressed by c as (2.92) with (2.91). their determinants are given by

c(n, )i,jhj|ib,
c(n, )i,j(th)j|ib.

ti|ib = xj

lkn(cid:16)xr(r1)(+l,k20)  xr(r1)(+l,k20)(cid:17)p(nlk)
= yl,k1

,

the inner product of two states in the verma module becomes (see (2.94))

h|titj|i = < (tt )i|ib, tj|ib >

c(n, )i,kgk,lc(n, )j,l.

we set

r = r  1.

l = l  id on fl,k (see subsection 5.2). z is an arbitrary point, for example we take z = 1.

this x(z) is well dened on fl,k (l, k)

(3.74)

where z = x2u, zi = x2ui and dzj is given in (a.14). here we have used x+(z1)x+(z2) =
h(u1  u2)x+(z2)x+(z1) (as a meromorphic function) with h(u) = [u+1]
[u1] (see subsection
5.2), and the formula (a.12) with r  r 1. from the factor [i] in the last line of (3.74),
we have (use (a.10))

moreover x(z) has the property,

x(z)p = 0.

[tn, x(z)l] = 0 on fl,k

l  l (mod p).

(3.75)

(3.76)

this can be proved by (3.55) and careful analysis of location of poles [41]. we dene the
brst charge qm as

let us consider the felder complex cl,k,

qm = x(1)m.

where cj and xj

x3 c2

x2 c1

  
: cj  cj+1 (j  z) are

x1 c0

x0 c1

x1 c2

x2    ,

c2j = fl2pj,k, c2j+1 = fl2pj,k,
x2j = ql, x2j+1 = qpl.

x satises the brst property,

xjxj1 = 0.

(3.77)

(3.78)

(3.79)

(3.80)

(3.81)

we assume that this felder complex has the same structure as the virasoro case because
it formally tends to virasoro one in the conformal limit (x  1 and r and z = x2u xed
kept). then the cohomology groups of the complex cl,k are

h j(cl,k) = ker xj/im xj1 =( 0

ll,k

j 6= 0,
j = 0,

(3.82)

where ll,k is the irreducible dva module of  = l,k. the trace of operator o over ll,k
can be written as (see (2.122))

trll,ko = trh 0(cl,k)o(0) = trh(cl,k)o =xjz

(1)jtrcjo(j),

(3.83)

38

where o(j) is an operator o realized on cj.

if we use x(z) instead of x+(z), another complex cl,k in which k of fl,k changes is

obtained. the corresponding screening operator is

x(z) =ic

dzx(z)

[u  u  1
[u  u + 1
2]
where [u] in (a.5), z = x2u, z = x2u, dz = dz
2iz , and the integration contour c is a
simple closed curve that encircles z = x1+2rnz but not z = x12r(n+1)z (n = 0, 1, 2,  ).
k is k = k  id on fl,k (see subsection 5.2). x(z) is well dened on fl,k (l, k),
x(z) : fl,k 7 fl,k2, and x(z) satises

[tn, x(z)k] = 0

on fl,k

k  k (mod p).

(3.85)

(3.86)

by setting the brst charge as qm = x(1)m, another felder complex cl,k = {cj, xj :
cj  cj+1} is c2j = fl,k2pj, c2j+1 = fl,k2pj, x2j = qk, x2j+1 = qpk, and the
cohomology is h j(cl,k) = ker xj/im xj1 = j,0ll,k.

3.4.4 trigonometric ruijsenaars-schneider model and macdonald symmetric

polynomial

the trigonometric ruijsenaars-schneider model (trsm) is a relativistic version of the
calogero-sutherland model. the ruijsenaars-schneider model is a many body system
with suciently enough conserved quantities hk (k = 1,   , n0) [42] (see also [43]),

where i (i = 1,   , n0) is a rapidity and qi is its conjugate variable and qi =
is
a coordinate. their dimensions are [i] = 1, [qi] =  and [qi] = l. (exactly speaking
i and qi are related to the coordinate qi and momentum pi by qi = mcqi cosh i and
pi = mc sinh i. but we skip this procedure. see [44].) j is

where  is a coupling constant and (z) is the weierstrass  function. these conserved
quantities commute mutually

[hk, hl] = 0

(k, l = n0,   , n0).

. qdi is a q-shift, qdif (x1,   , xi,   , xn0) = f (x1,   , qxi,   , xn0).

the macdonald symmetric polynomial p = p(x; q, t) is a multivariable orthogonal
polynomial with two parameters q and t, which is determined uniquely by the following
conditions [36],

(i) p =x

u,m(x),

u, = 1,

(ii)

hp, piq,t = 0 if  6= ,

(3.101)

(3.102)

moreover the macdonald symmetric polynomial is the simultaneous eigenfunction of the
macdonald operators,

or

remark that p(x; q, t) = p(x; q1, t1) and hf, giq1,t1 = (qt1)n0hf, giq,t. in the con-
formal limit,

t = q,

q  1,

 : xed,

(3.105)

which corresponds to the non-relativistic limit (c  ) (see (3.95)), the macdonald
polynomial reduces to the jack polynomial

p(x; q, t) = j(x; ).

lim

  1 limit of the jack polynomial is the schur polynomial s(x) = lim

limit of the macdonald polynomial is also s(x) = lim

(3.107)

(3.108)

like as the jack symmetric polynomial, the macdonald symmetric polynomial has an
integral representation obtained by the following two transformations,

gk

: (cid:16)gkf(cid:17)(x1,   , xl) =

lyi=1

(3.110)

(3.111)

the macdonald symmetric polynomial with  ( = ((l1)k1, (l2)k2,   , (ln1)kn1)) is ex-
pressed as [45]

p(x)  nl,l1gk1nl1,l2gk2   nln2,ln1gkn1nln1,0  1,

(3.112)

because the macdonald symmetric polynomial has two properties

(l variables),

p(kl)+ = gkp
p = hp, piq,t

l!hp, pil;q,tnl,lp

(p in lhs : l variables)
(p in rhs : l variables)

.

(3.113)

(3.114)

this second property is valid if nl,l is modied in the following way [18],

p  n l,lp,

lyj=1

dxj  (x, x)(x)c(x)f (x1,   , xl),

(3.115)

where c(x) = c(x1,   , xl) is an arbitrary pseudoconstant with respect to the q-shift,
qdic(x) = c(x) (i). (remark that hd1(q, t)f, gil;q,t = hf, d1(q, t)gil;q,t.)
for example, the macdonald symmetric polynomial with a rectangular young diagram

tn0iqi|l,ki,

(3.129)

where the partition  is  = (kl, 0n0l). therefore |l,ki is an eigenstate of d, i.e., it
gives the macdonald symmetric polynomial by the map (3.122). in fact the polynomial
obtained from (3.61) by (3.122) agrees with the integral representation of the macdon-
ald symmetric polynomial with partition (kl) in (3.116) up to xi  xi and c(z) in
(3.62), which is irrelevant because c(z) is a pseudoconstant with respect to the q-shift,
qdzi c(z) = c(z) (i).

the macdonald symmetric polynomial with general partition whose young diagram
is composed of n  1 rectangles is related to the singular vector of the deformed wn
algebra [18].

we have established the relation between the macdonald symmetric polynomials and
the singular vectors of dva in free eld realization. when the dva was rstly formulated
in [17], this relation was not the derived property but the guiding principle to nd the
dva. at that time we knew the two facts:

(i) in the free eld realization, the singular vectors of the virasoro and wn algebras

realize the jack symmetric polynomials [35, 32].

(ii) the jack symmetric polynomials have the good q-deformation, the macdonald sym-

metric polynomials [36].

based on these, we set up the following natural question:

 construct the algebras whose singular vectors in the free eld realization realize the

macdonald symmetric polynomials.

the resultant algebra are worth being called quantum deformation (q-deformation) of the
virasoro and wn algebras in this sense. this scenario is illustrated in the following gure,

in this subsection we present higher dva currents. we dene higher dva currents t(n)(z)
(n = 1, 2,  ) by fusion,

t(1)(z) = t (z), t(0)(z) = 1,
t(n)(z) = f(1),(n1)(xrn z

f(n),(m)(z) =

where delta function terms are neglected. (the arguments of w(n)(u) and f(n),(m)(u, v) in
[46] should be shifted in order to compare them with t(n)(z) and f(n),(m)(z) here.)

4 solvable lattice models and elliptic algebras

46

4.1 solvable lattice models and yang-baxter equation

a statistical lattice model is a statistical mechanical system on a lattice [6]. in this lecture
we consider classical systems on two dimensional space square lattice. there are two types
of lattice models, vertex models and face models. for vertex models dynamical variables
spin are located on edges and the boltzmann weights are assigned to each vertex. on
the other hand, for face models, dynamical variables height are located on vertices and
the boltzmann weights are assigned to each face.

here , , ,  are spins, a, b, c, d are heights, and r,(u) and w(cid:16) a

mann weights. we have assumed that the spectral parameters enter in the boltzmann
weight only through their dierence u. roughly speaking, a vertex model on a lattice is
a face model on its dual lattice. a face model is also called an interaction round a face
(irf) model or a solid on solid (sos) model. if the height variable takes a nite number
of states, a sos model is called a restricted sos (rsos) model.

solutions of the yang-baxter equation were studied by many people and the relation
to the lie algebras was claried [5, 8, 9, 10]. three types of solutions are known; rational,

lattice size is n (horizontal) by m (vertical), and we assume the periodic boundary
condition. then the partition function is

z = tr(cid:16)t (u)m(cid:17).

(4.10)

in the thermodynamic limit (n, m  ), only the maximal eigenvalue of the transfer
matrix contributes to the partition function. once we know information about the eigen-
values and eigenvectors of the transfer matrix, we can calculate various phyical quantities.
if the boltzmann weight satises the yang-baxter equation, the transfer matrix has
good properties. for example the trasfer matrices with dierent spectral parameters
commute each other,

[t (u),t (v)] = 0.

or w (u  v) t (u) t (v) = t (v) t (u)w (u  v).

(4.14)

(4.15)

(4.16)

(here we do not write tensor product explicitly.) therefore we obtain (4.11) by taking a
trace of r(u  v) t (u) t (v)r(u  v)1 = t (v) t (u).

if we interpret a r matrix as a l matrix (l operator), whose entries are operators

acting on vertical vector space,

l(u) =(cid:16)l(u),(cid:17), (cid:16)l(u),(cid:17),

= 


u





,

(4.17)

then (4.2) is rewritten as

r(12)(u  v)l(1)(u)l(2)(v) = l(2)(v)l(1)(u)r(12)(u  v).

the monodoromy matrix is

t (u) = l1(u)l2(u)   ln (u),

(4.18)

the r matrix obtained from the boltzmann weight of the face model satises the

dynamical yang-baxter equation [24],

= r(23)(v; )r(13)(u;  + h(2))r(12)(u  v; ).

(4.20)

50

here h is an element of the cartan subalgebra (see subsections 4.3, 4.4). for simpliclity
we consider an vector representation case. associated to the face boltzmann weight (4.7),

4.2 corner transfer matrices and vertex operators

in the previous subsection the row-to-row transfer matrix is explained. there is another
powerful method, corner trasfer matrix (ctm) method, which was developed by baxter
[6].
in the following we consider face models in which heights take values in a set i.
vertex models are also treated similarly.

let us consider the square lattice. we take the central site as the reference site o and

devide a lattice into four quadrants.

a

b

o

d

c




for each quadrant we assign a matrix a, b, c, d, which are called corner transfer matrices.
we take a multiplication of matrices counterclockwise. sites on each column (row) are

(4.24)

51

numbered increasingly from south to north (from east to west),    ,2,1, 0, 1, 2,  ,
where the zeroth site is the reference site o. for example a(u) = (aa,b(u)) is

aa,b(u) = a0,b0

,



...




u
 
b2






u u
  
b1







u u u
  
b0
   a2 a1 a0



(4.25)

where a = (a0, a1, a2,  ), b = (b0, b1, b2,  ), and summation is taken over inner sites .
using these ctms the partition function is expressed as

z = tr (dcba),

(4.26)

and one-point local height probability (lhp), which is a probability of nding local height
at o to be k, is

pk = z1tra0=k(dcba).

(4.27)

to discuss these quantities, however, we have to specify the ground state.

we restrict ourselves to consider the following ground state conguration

which is invariant under the shift in the ne-sw direction. many interesting models have
this type of ground states. we label this ground state conguration (i.e. an ordered set
(i1, i2,   , i) whose cyclic permutations are identied) as an integer l. on each column or
row the height sequence is    , i1, i2,   , i, i1, i2,   , i,  , but there are  congurations
because the height on the zeroth site takes one of  values im+1. we distinguish these
congurations by an integer m  z/z. namely the ground state conguration (l, m),

52

which we denote a(l, m), is

ajm(l, m) = ij+1
aj+(l, m) = aj(l, m)

(0  j    1),

(j  z).

(4.29)

when we discuss this face model, we impose the condition that heights at the boundary
(or sites far away from o) take one of the ground state congurations.

in the north and west directions the ground state congurations are    , i1, i2,  ,i,  .
let h(k)
l,m denote the space of states of the half-innite lattice where the central height
(i.e. the one on the zeroth site) is xed to k and the boundary heights are in the ground
state (l, m). formally it is

h(k)

l,m = spann(aj)j=0 (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) aj  i, a0 = k, aj = aj(l, m) (j  1)o.

in the south and east directions we relabel the numbering of sites : 0,1,2,   7
0, 1, 2,  . then the ground state congurations are in the south and east directions are
   , i,   , i2, i1,  . so we introduce

(4.30)

h (k)

l,m = spann(aj)j=0 (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) aj  i, a0 = k, aj = aj(l, m) (j  1)o,

where aj(l, m) = aj(l, m). we have

when we consider the action of tcol in this vertex operator approach, it is convenient
in general for two vector
spaces vi (i = 1, 2) a vector of v1  v2 can be regarded as a linear map from v2 to v1 by
tf2 where f1 and f2 are understood as column vectors. when there
f1  f2  v1  v2 7 f1
is an isomorphism p : v1  v2, a vector of v1  v2 can be regarded as a linear map on
v2,

similarly

we remark that these tcol and trow are dened on an innitely large lattice from
the beginning in contrast to those in subsection 4.1. their excited states are created
by another type of vertex operators, type ii vos, from the vacuum state (note that we
need also the translation non-invariant vacuum states to obtain a complete set of excited
states) [48]. we will give an example in subsection 5.4. commutation relations for type
ii vo will be given in subsection 4.4, section 5 and section 6.

introduction to quasi-hopf algebra

in this subsection we illustrate an outline of a quasi-hopf algebra. for more details we
refer the readers to refs.[11, 26]

in quantum mechanics, we know an addition of angular momentums very well. for
two particles system the total angular momentum ~j is obtained simply by an addition of
each angular momentum ~j (1) and ~j (2),

~j = ~j (1) + ~j (2).

(4.114)

in mathematics, this formula is written in the following way; ~j (1) acts on the represen-
tation space v1, ~j (2) acts on v2, and the total angular momentum ~j acts on v1  v2
by,

~j = ~j  1 + 1  ~j.

(4.115)

this is called the tensor product representation of lie algebra so(3).
if a system has
rotational symmetry, for example the heisenberg spin chain (xxx spin chain), one can
apply the representation theory of the rotational group so(3) (or its lie algebra so(3))
to it. but if the system is perturbed and looses the rotational symmetry, then one can
not apply so(3) to it. some models, however, have a good property. for example the
xxz spin chain has the same degeneracy of energy as the xxx spin chain. to treat such
models we need some deformation of the lie algebra or some deformation of the tensor
product representation.

1. algebra and coalgebra

let us begin with the denitions of an algebra and a coalgebra. for simplicity we take
the complex eld c as a base eld. an algebra a is a vector space with two operations,
product (multiplication) m and unit u, which satisfy

mid a  a

product

unit

m : a  a  a
u : c  a

associativity m  (m  id) = m  (id  m),

(4.116)

ym

a

a  a  a
idm
a  a

y

m

and m  (id  u) = id = m  (u  id) (a  c, a and c  a are identied). if we write
m(a  b) = ab, the associativity becomes a usual form (ab)c = a(bc).

a coalgebra is dened by reversing the arrows. a coalgebra a is a vector space with

two operations, coproduct  and counit , which satisfy

id a  a

a  a  a
id
a  a 

x

x

a

coproduct

counit

 : a  a  a
 : a  c

coassociativity (  id)   = (id  )  ,

(4.117)

64

and (id  )   = id = (  id)   (a  c, a and c  a are identied).

let us introduce  ( : a  a  a  a, (a  b) = b  a) and dene m = m  
and  =   . an algebra is called commutative if m = m, and a coalgebra is called
cocommutative if  = .

2. hopf algebra

a hopf algebra is a set (a, m, u, , , s) satisfying the following conditions: a is an
algebra and a coalgebra; m, u, ,  are homomorphism; antipode s : a  a satises
m  (s  id)   = u   = m  (id  s)  . s is an anti-homomorphism.

we give two examples of a hopf algebra, a group g and a lie algebra g, exactly
speaking a function algebra of group fun(g) and an enveloping algebra of lie algebra
u(g) respectively. their hopf algebra structures are

product
unit
coproduct
counit
antipode

u(g)
xy
u(a) = a1

fun(g) = map(g, c)
(f1f2)(x) = f1(x)f2(x)
(u(a))(x) = a
((f ))(x1, x2) = f (x1x2) (x) = x  1 + 1  x
((f ))(x) = f (e)
(s(f ))(x) = f (x1)

(x) = 0
s(x) = x,

(4.118)

and (m(g))(x) = g(x, x) for g(x1, x2)  map(g  g, c), and (1) = 1  1, (1) = 1,
s(1) = 1 for u(g). roughly speaking ,  and s correspond to

fun(g)

  product of g
  unit element of g
s  inverse element of g contragredient rep. of u(g).

u(g)
tensor product rep. of u(g)
trivial rep. of u(g)

(4.119)

fun(g) is a commutative (and non-cocommutative) hopf algebra and u(g) is a cocom-
mutative (and non-commutative) hopf algebra. non-commutative and non-cocommutative
hopf algebra may be regarded as an extension (deformation) of group or lie algebra in
this sense. this is the idea of quantum group (quantum algebra).

the quantum group (quantum algebra) is a hopf algebra. we give an example of the
quantum group, uq(sl2), which is a deformation of u(sl2). uq(sl2) is generated by t = qh,
e and f , which satisfy

[h, e] = 2e
[h, f ] = 2f
[e, f ] = tt1
qq1

(h) = h  1 + 1  h
(e) = e  1 + t  e
(f ) = f  t1 + 1  f

(h) = 0
(e) = 0
(f ) = 0

s(h) = h
s(e) = t1e
s(f ) = f t.

(4.120)

65

this quantum algebra appears in the xxz spin chain as a symmetry,

[hxxz, uq(sl2)] = 0,

hxxz = j

h =xi

where ~s = 1

2~ and s = s1  is2. in the q  1 limit, uq(sl2) reduces to u(sl2).

3. quasi-triangular hopf algebra

using the coproduct, a tensor product representation of two representations (i, vi) (i =
1, 2) of the hopf algebra can be dened in the following way,

coassociativity implies the isomorphism,

(cid:16)(1  2)  , v1  v2(cid:17).

(4.122)

(v1  v2)  v3 = v1  (v2  v3)

(as a module).

(4.123)

but cocommutativity does not hold in general, so the following isomorphism depends on
the detail of the hopf algebra:

v1  v2

?= v2  v1

(as a module).

(4.124)

= v2  v1,
of course we have v1  v2 = v2  v1 as vector space, by pv1v2 : v1  v2
pv1v2(v1  v2) = v2  v1. but the problem is the commutativity of the action of a and
pv1v2.

drinfeld considered the situation that the isomorphism (4.124) does hold. a quasi-
triangular hopf algebra (a, m, u, , , s,r) (we abbreviate it as (a, ,r)) is a hopf al-
gebra with a universal r matrix r, which satises

r  a  a : universal r matrix

(a  a),

(a) = r(a)r1
(  id)r = r(13)r(23),
(id  )r = r(13)r(12),

(  id)r = 1,
(id  )r = 1.

(4.125)

then we have an intertwiner

rv1v2 = pv1v2  (1  2)(r) : v1  v2

= v2  v1

(as a module),

(4.126)

and r satises the yang-baxter equation,

r(12)r(13)r(23) = r(23)r(13)r(12).

(4.127)

66

4. quasi-triangular quasi-hopf algebra

as presented in 2 the quantum group is obtained from the lie algebra by relaxing one
condition, cocommutativity. here we relax one more condition, coassociativity. coasso-
ciativity (4.117) is modied by a coassociator  in the following way,

  a  a  a : coassociator

(id  )(a) = (  id)(a)1
(id  id  )  (  id  id) = (1  )  (id    id)  (  1),
(id    id) = 1.

(a  a),

(4.128)

a quasi-triangular quasi-hopf algebra (a, m, u, , , , s, , ,r) (we abbreviate it as
(a, , ,r)) satises (4.128) and
r  a  a

(a) = r(a)r1
(a  a),
(  id)r = (312)r(13)(132)1
(id  )r = (231)1

r(23)(123),
r(13)(213)r(12)(123)1

(4.129)

,

where (312) means (312) =pi zi  xi  yi for  =pi xi  yi  zi. ,   a satisfy

(4.130)

xi
xi

xis(yi)zi = 1,

s(bi)ci = (a), xi

bis(ci) = (a) (a  a),

(4.131)

where (a) =pi bi  ci. then r enjoys the yang-baxter type equation,
r(13)(213)r(12).

r(23)(123) = (321)r(23)(231)1

r(12)(312)r(13)(132)1

(4.132)

a quasi-hopf algebra with  = 1 is nothing but a hopf algebra.

5. twist

quasi-hopf algebras admit an important operation, twist. for any invertible element
f  a  a ((  id)f = (id  )f = 1), which is called as a twistor, there is a map from
quasi-hopf algebras to quasi-hopf algebras:

quasi-hopf algebra  quasi-hopf algebra

(a, , ,r)

f (a,e,e, er).

67

(4.133)

new coproduct, coassociator, r matrix etc. are given by

f  a  a : twistor

(a  a),

e = f (a)f 1
e =(cid:16)f (23)(id  )f(cid:17)(cid:16)f (12)(  id)f(cid:17)1
er = f (21)rf 1,
 =xi
es = s,
e = ,

e =xi

s(di)ei,

,

(4.134)

fis(gi),

where pi di  ei = f 1 and pi fi  gi = f . we remark that an algebra a itself is

unchanged.
if a twistor f satises the cocycle condition, this twist operation maps a
hopf algebra to a hopf algebra. for a general twistor f , however, a hopf algebra is
mapped to a quasi-hopf algebra:

hopf algebra  quasi-hopf algebra

(a, ,r)

f (a,e,e, er).

(4.135)

let h be an abelian subalgebra of a, with the product written additively. a twistor
f ()  a  a depending on   h is a shifted cocycle if it satises the relation (shifted
cocycle condition),

f () : shifted cocycle

 f (12)()(  id)f () = f (23)( + h(1))(id  )f (),

(4.136)

for some h  h.

when a twistor f () satises the shifted cocycle condition, we obtain a quasi-triangular

quasi-hopf algebra from a quasi-triangular hopf algebra by twisting,

hopf algebra  quasi-hopf algebra
 (a, , (),r()),

(a, ,r)

f ()

and we have

() = f (23)()f (23)( + h(1))1,
(  id)r() = (312)()r(13)()r(23)( + h(1)),
(id  )r() = r(13)( + h(2))r(12)()(123)()1

,

(4.137)

(4.138)

and r matrix satises the dynamical yang-baxter equation,

r(12)( + h(3))r(13)()r(23)( + h(1)) = r(23)()r(13)( + h(2))r(12)().

4.4 elliptic quantum groups

the solutions of ybe (r-matrices) are classied into two types, vertex-type and face-type.
corresponding to these two there are two types of elliptic quantum groups (algebras).

the vertex-type elliptic algebras are associated with the r-matrix r(u) of baxter [49]
and belavin [50]. the rst example of this sort is the sklyanin algebra [51], designed as
an elliptic deformation of the lie algebra sl2. it is presented by the rll-relation

r(12)(u1  u2)l(1)(u1)l(2)(u2) = l(2)(u2)l(1)(u1)r(12)(u1  u2),

(4.140)

together with a specic choice of the form for l(u). r and l depend on an elliptic

modulus r. foda et al.[23] proposed its ane version, aq,p(bsl2),

r(12)(u1  u2, r)l(1)(u1)l(2)(u2) = l(2)(u2)l(1)(u1)r(12)(u1  u2, r  c),

(4.141)

whose main point of is the shift of r by a central element c.

the face-type algebras are based on r-matrices of andrews, baxter, forrester [52]
and generalizations [53, 8, 10]. in this case, besides the elliptic modulus, r and l depend
also on extra parameter(s) . as felder has shown [24], the rll relation undergoes a
dynamical shift by elements h of the cartan subalgebra,

r(12)(u1  u2,  + h)l(1)(u1, )l(2)(u2,  + h(1))

= l(2)(u2, )l(1)(u1,  + h(2))r(12)(u1  u2, ),

(4.142)

and the ybe itself is modied to a dynamical one (4.139), (4.20). as we shall see, a
central extension of this algebra is obtained by introducing further a shift of the elliptic
modulus analogous to (4.141) (see (4.196)-(4.197) and the remark following them).

these two algebras, rll relations (4.141) and (4.142), seemed to be dierent but
frnsdal [25] pointed out that they have a common structure; they are quasi-hopf algebras
obtained by twisting quantum ane algebras. namely, there exist two types of twistors
which give rise to dierent comultiplications on the quantum ane algebras uq(g), and the
resultant quasi-hopf algebras are nothing but the two types of elliptic quantum groups.
in [26] explicit formulas for the twistors satisfying the shifted cocycle condition were

presented and two types of elliptic quantum groups, aq,p(bsln) and bq,(g), were dened:

twistor hopf algebra

quasi-hopf algebra

type

the face-type algebra has also been given an alternative formulation in terms of the
drinfeld currents. this is the approach adopted by enriquez and felder [54] and konno
[55]. the drinfeld currents are suited to deal with innite dimensional representations.

1. quantum group

first let us x the notation. let g be the kac-moody lie algebra associated with a
symmetrizable generalized cartan matrix a = (aij)i,ji [56]. we x an invariant inner
product ( , ) on the cartan subalgebra h and identify h with h via ( , ).
if {i}ii
denotes the set of simple roots, then (i, j) = diaij, where di = 1

2 (i, i).

consider the corresponding quantum group u = uq(g). hereafter we x a complex
number q 6= 0, |q| < 1. the algebra u has generators ei, fi (i  i) and h (h  h),
satisfying the standard relations

[h, h] = 0

(h, h  h),

[h, ei] = (h, i)ei,

[ei, fj] = ij

i

ti  t1
qi  q1

i

[h, fi] = (h, i)fi

(i, j  i),

(i  i, h  h),

(4.144)

(4.145)

(4.146)

and the serre relations which we omit. in (4.146) we have set qi = qdi, ti = qi. we adopt
the hopf algebra structure given as follows.

(h) = h  1 + 1  h,
(ei) = ei  1 + ti  ei, (fi) = fi  t1
(ei) = (fi) = (h) = 0,
s(ei) = t1

i ei, s(fi) = fiti, s(h) = h,

i + 1  fi,

where i  i and h  h.

let r  u2 denote the universal r matrix of u. it has the form

r = qtc,
c = xq+

q(,)(cid:16)q  q(cid:17)c = 1 xii

(qi  q1

i )eit1

i  tifi +    .

(4.147)

(4.148)

(4.149)

(4.150)

(4.151)

(4.152)

here the notation is as follows. take a basis {hl} of h, and its dual basis {hl}. then

t =xl

hl  hl

(4.153)

  u

element of u +
the subalgebra of u generated by the ei (resp. fi), and u

denotes the canonical element of h  h. the element c =pj u,j  uj
homogeneous components with respect to the natural gradation by q+ =pi

 is the canonical
 with respect to a certain hopf pairing, where u + (resp. u) denotes
 (  q+) signies the
z0i. (for
the details the reader is referred e.g. to [11, 57].) basic properties of the universal r
matrix is given in (4.125).

70

2. face type algebra

let   h be an element such that (, i) = di for all i  i. let  be an automorphism of
u given by

 = ad(q

1

2pl hlhl),

where {hl}, {hl} are as in (4.153). in other words,
(ei) = eiti, (fi) = t1

i fi, (qh) = qh.

since

we have

ad(qt )  (  ) = ad(q

1

2p l (hlhl)()),

ad(qt )  (  )   =   .

for   h, introduce an automorphism

 = ad(qp l hlhl+2()) = 2  ad(q2).

(4.154)

(4.155)

(4.156)

(4.157)

(4.158)

xyk1(cid:16)k

  id(cid:17)(cid:16)qtr(cid:17)1
xyk1

then the expression (  id)(qtr) is a formal power series in the variables xi = q2(,i)
i )xieiti  tifi +   . we dene the twistor f () as

(qi  q1

(i  i) of the form 1 xi

follows.
[face type twistor]

f () =

.

(4.159)

here and after, we use the ordered product symbol

ak =    a3a2a1. note that the
k-th factor in the product (4.159) is a formal power series in the xk
i with leading term 1,
and hence the innite product makes sense. then the face type twistor (4.159) satises
the shifted cocycle condition

f (12)()(  id)f () = f (23)( + h(1))(id  )f (),

and

(  id) f () = (id  ) f () = 1.

a proof of this property and examples are given in [26]. in (4.160), if  =pl lhl, then
 + h(1) meanspl(l + h(1)

l )hl. hence we have, for example,

(4.160)

(4.161)

ad(q2lt (12)
ad(q2lt (13)

k

)f (23)
)f (23)

() = f (23)
() = f (23)

k

k

k

( + lh(1)),
(  lh(1)).

71

for convenience, let us give a name to the quasi-hopf algebra associated with the

twistor (4.159).
[face type algebra] we dene the quasi-hopf algebra bq,(g) of face type to be the set

(uq(g), , (),r()) together with  =pi s(di)ei,  =pi fis(gi), the antiautomor-

phism s dened by (4.150) and  dened by (4.149),

(a) = f (12)() (a) f (12)()1,
r() = f (21)()r f (12)()1,
() = f (23)()f (23)( + h(1))1,

(4.162)

(4.163)

(4.164)

andpi di  ei = f ()1,pi fi  gi = f ().

let us consider the case where g is of ane type, in which we are mainly interested.

let c be the canonical central element and d the scaling element. we set

   = rd + sc +    (r, s  c),

(4.165)

where  stands for the classical part of   h. denote by {hj}, {hj} the classical part of
the dual basis of h. since c is central,  is independent of s. writing p = q2r, we have

 = ad(pdq2cd)  ,

 = ad(qp hj hj +2()).

set further

r(z) = ad(zd  1)(r),
f (z, ) = ad(zd  1)(f ()),
r(z, ) = ad(zd  1)(r()) = (cid:16)f (z1, )(cid:17)r(z)f (z, )1.

(4.166)

(4.167)

(4.168)

(4.169)

(4.167) and (4.168) are formal power series in z, whereas (4.169) contains both positive
and negative powers of z. note that qcd+dcr(z)|z=0 reduces to the universal r matrix
of uq(g) corresponding to the underlying nite dimensional lie algebra g. from the
denition (4.159) of f () we have the dierence equation

f (pq2c(1)

z, ) = (   id)1(cid:16)f (z, )(cid:17)  qtr(pq2c(1)

z),

(4.170)

with the initial condition f (0, ) = f g(), where f g() signies the twistor corresponding
to g.

3. vertex type algebra

when g =bsln, it is possible to construct a dierent type of twistor. we call it vertex type.

72

let us write hi = i (i = 0, . . . , n  1). a basis of h is {h0, . . . , hn1, d}. the element

d gives the homogeneous grading,

[d, ei] = i0ei,

[d, fi] = i0fi,

(4.171)

for all i = 0, . . . , n1. let the dual basis be {0, . . . , n1, c}. the i are the fundamental

weights and c is the canonical central element. let  be the automorphism of uq(bsln) such

that

 (ei) = ei+1 mod n,

 (fi) = fi+1 mod n,

 (hi) = hi+1 mod n

(4.172)

and  n = id. then we have

 (i) = i+1 mod n 

n  1  2i

2n

c.

the element  =pn1

i=0 i is invariant under  . it gives the principal grading

[, ei] = ei,

[, fi] = fi,

for all i = 0, . . . , n  1. note also that

(   )   =   ,

(   )(c) = c ().

for r  c, we introduce an automorphism

and set

2(r+c)

n

(cid:17),

er =   ad(cid:16)q
n(cid:16)  c + c   

1

n2  1
12

c  c(cid:17).

et =

then (cid:16)er  id(cid:17)(cid:16)qetr(cid:17)1
case, this is a formal series with a non-trivial leading term qtet (1 +   ). nevertheless,

n where p = q2r. unlike the face

is a formal power series in p

the n-fold product

(4.173)

(4.174)

(4.175)

(4.176)

(4.177)

takes the form 1 +   , because of the relation

we now dene the vertex type twistor e(r) as follows.
[vertex type twistor]

r  id(cid:17)(cid:16)qetr(cid:17)1
xynk1(cid:16)ek
nxk=1(cid:0) k  id(cid:1)(cid:16)t  et(cid:17) = 0.

73

e(r) =

(4.178)

(4.179)

.

(4.180)

the innite product

xyk1

is to be understood as lim
n
n . then the vertex type twistor (4.180)

. in view of the remark made

1

xynnk1

above, e(r) is a well dened formal series in p
satises the shifted cocycle condition

e(12)(r)(  id)e(r) = e(23)(r + c(1))(id  )e(r),

and

(  id) e(r) = (id  ) e(r) = 1.

(4.181)

(4.182)

a proof of this property and an example are given in [26].

[vertex type algebra]we dene the quasi-hopf algebra aq,p(bsln) (p = q2r) of vertex type
to be the set (uq(bsln), r, (r),r(r)) together with r =pi s(di)ei, r =pi fis(gi), the

antiautomorphism s dened by (4.150) and  dened by (4.149),

r(a) = e(12)(r) (a) e(12)(r)1,
r(r) = e(21)(r)r e(12)(r)1,
(r) = e(23)(r)e(23)(r + c(1))1,

er() = (cid:16)ad( )  id(cid:17)(qetr),
e(, r) = (cid:16)ad( )  id(cid:17)e(r).

(4.183)

(4.184)

(4.185)

(4.186)

(4.187)

andpi di  ei = e(r)1,pi fi  gi = e(r).

let us set

in just the same way as in the face type case, the denition (4.180) can be alternatively
described as the unique solution of the dierence equation

e(p

n q

4. dynamical rll-relations and vertex operators

the l-operators and vertex operators for the elliptic algebras can be constructed from
those of uq(g) by dressing the latter with the twistors. in this subsection, we examine
various commutation relations among these operators. we shall mainly discuss the case
of the face type algebra bq,(g) where g is of ane type.

hereafter we write u = uq(g), b = bq,(g). by a representation of the quasi-hopf
algebra b we mean that of the underlying associative algebra u. let (v , v ) be a nite

74

dimensional module over u, and (v,z, vz) be the evaluation representation associated
with it where v,z = v  ad(zd).
we dene l-operators for b by

(4.189)

(4.190)

(4.191)

(4.192)

(4.193)

(4.194)

(4.195)

(4.196)

lv (z, ) = (v,z  id)r(),
r+() = qcd+dcr(),
r() = r(21)()1qcddc.

rv w ( z1
z2

, ) = (v,z1 w,z2)r().

r(z, ) = ad(zd  1)r(),

likewise we set

setting further

we nd from the dynamical ybe (4.139) that

r(12)( z1

z2

= r(23)( z2

,  + h(3))r(13)(qc(2) z1
, )r(13)(qc(2) z1
,  + h(3))r+(13)( z1

z3

z3

z3

r+(12)(qc(3) z1

z2

= r(23)( z2

z3

, )r+(13)( z1

z3

z3

z3

,  + h(1))

, )r(23)( z2
,  + h(2))r(12)( z1
, )r(23)( z2
,  + h(1))
,  + h(2))r+(12)(qc(3) z1

z2

z3

z2

, ),

, ).

applying v  w  id, we obtain the dynamical rll relation,
w (z2,  + h(1))
v w ( z1
z2

(z1, )l(2)

r(12)

v w ( z1
z2

v

v

,  + h)l(1)
w (z2, )l(1)
,  + h)l+(1)
w (z2, )l+(1)

= l(2)
v w (qc z1
z2
= l(2)

v

v

r+(12)

, ),

(z1,  + h(2))r(12)
(z1, )l(2)
(z1,  + h(2))r+(12)

w (z2,  + h(1))
v w (qc z1
z2

, ).

(4.197)

here the index (1) (resp. (2)) refers to v (resp. w ), and h, c (without superx) are
elements of h  b. if we write

   = rd + sc +    (r, s  c,   h),

(4.198)

then

 + h(1) = (r + h + c(1))d + (s + d(1))c + ( + h(1)),

(4.199)

where h is the dual coxeter number. the parameter r plays the role of the elliptic
modulus. note that, in (4.196)-(4.197), r also undergoes a shift depending on the central
element c.

actually the two l-operators (4.189) are not independent. we have

v (pqcz, ) = q2 tv,(ad( x)  id)1lv (z, ),
l+

(4.200)

75

where

tv, =xj

(hj)  hj,

x = (qp hj hj +2()).

(4.201)

next let us consider vertex operators. let (v,z, vz) be as before, and let v () be a
highest weight module with highest weight . consider intertwiners of u-modules of the
form

v

(,)
(,)

v

(z)

(z)

: v ()  v ()  vz,
: vz  v ()  v (),

(4.202)

(4.203)

which are called vertex operators of type i and type ii respectively. dene the corre-
sponding vos for b as follows [58]:

v

(,)
(,)

v

(z, ) = (id  z)f ()  (,)
(z, ) = (,)

v

v

(z),

(z)  (z  id)f ()1.

(4.204)

(4.205)

when there is no fear of confusion, we often drop the sub(super)scripts v or (, ). it is
clear that (4.204) and (4.205) satisfy the intertwining relations relative to the coproduct
 (4.162),

(a)(z, ) = (z, )a
a(z, ) = (z, )(a)

(a  b),

(a  b).

(4.206)

(4.207)

these intertwining relations can be encapsulated to commutation relations with the l-
operators.

the dressed vos (4.204), (4.205) satisfy the following dynamical intertwining rela-

tions (see the diagram below):

,  + h)l+

v (z1, )w (z2,  + h(1)),

v (z1, ) = r+

notice that the w -factors stay the same with the trigonometric case, and are not aected

the case of vertex type algebras can be treated in a parallel way. see [26].

5. drinfeld currents

the drinfeld currents are suited to deal with innite dimensional representations. we

explain it by taking uq(bsl2) as an example. (see [61] for general case.)
first let us recall the drinfeld currents of uq(bsl2) [62]. let xn (n  z), an (n  z6=0),
h, c, d denote the drinfeld generators of uq(bsl2). in terms of the generating functions

xn zn,

(4.223)

(q

c

x(z) = xnz
2 z) = qh exp(cid:16)(q  q1)xn>0
2 z) = qh exp(cid:16)(q  q1)xn>0

(4.228)

(4.229)

(4.231)

(4.232)

(4.233)

(4.234)

the dening relations read as follows:

c : central ,

[h, d] = 0,

[h, an] = 0,

[an, am] =

[d, xn ] = nxn ,

[d, an] = nan,
[h, x(z)] = 2x(z),

[an, x(z)] = 
[an, x+(z)] =
(z  q2w)x(z)x(w) = (q2z  w)x(w)x(z),
[x+(z), x(w)] =

(4.230)

and the serre relation which we omit.

for the level 1 case (c = 1), x(z) has the following free boson realization [63],

x+(z) = : exp(cid:16)xn6=0
x(z) = : exp(cid:16)xn6=0

where an (n  z6=0) is given in (4.229), a0 and q are given in (2.49), and h = a0. for

general level c, uq(bsl2) has the wakimoto realization (see e.g. [64] and references therein).

we now introduce a new parameter p and modify (4.223)-(4.225) to dene another set

of currents. for notational convenience, we will frequently write

where r is

p = q2r,

p = pq2c = q2r,

r = r  c.

let us introduce two currents u(z, p)  uq(bsl2) depending on p by
an(qrz)n(cid:17),
an(qrz)n(cid:17).

u+(z, p) = exp(cid:16)xn>0
u(z, p) = exp(cid:16)xn>0

we dene the dressed currents x+(z, p), x(z, p), (z, p) by

x+(z, p) = u+(z, p)x+(z),
x(z, p) = x(z)u(z, p),
+(z, p) = u+(q
(z, p) = u+(q c

(4.242)

we call these as elliptic currents. they are drinfeld currents of uq(bsl2) or bq,(bsl2) which
is nothing but uq(bsl2) equipped with a dierent coproduct. we will often drop p, and

write x(z, p) as x(z) and so forth.

the merit of these currents is that they obey the following elliptic commutation

relations:

5 free field approach to abf model

lukyanov and pugai studied the andrews-baxter-forrester (abf) model and calculated
lhss by bosonizing vos in subsection 4.2 [21]. here we explain their work.

r, , x(z), t (z), n, n, hn, cl,k, etc. in this section are same as those in section 3.

in this section r is a positive integer,

5.1 abf model

the abf model [52] is a rsos model associated to the vector representation of a(1)
1
algebra [10]. the height variables a, b,   take one of the r  1 states 1, 2,   r  1 and
those on neighboring sites are subject to the condition |ab| = 1. we write the boltzmann
weight in the form

where an overall scalar factor (u) is given in (5.134) and chosen so that the partition
function per site equals to 1. non-zero components of w are given by

w(cid:16)a
a  2(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)u(cid:17) = 1,
a (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)u(cid:17) =

here [u] is given in (a.5) and we use a parameter x which is obtained from the original
nome p by the modular transformation (p = e2i 7 x2r = e2i 1
 ). low temperature
limit corresponds to x  0 (p  1).

this boltzmann weight w enjoys ybe (4.3), initial condition (4.38), unitarity (4.39)

and crossing symmetry (4.99) ( = 1, ga = [a]),

in this gauge w enjoys also a reection symmetry

along the additive variable u, we often use the multiplicative variable z = x2u.

we will restrict ourselves to the regime iii region dened by

0 < x < 1, 1 < u < 0.

in this region w is positive. on the critical point (x  1 (p  0)), a correlation length
becomes innite and this model becomes scale invariant, i.e. it has conformal symmetry.
so it is described by cft, i.e. virasoro algebra. in this case it corresponds to the minimal
unitary series with  = r
r1. on the o-critical point (x < 1), which corresponds to the
(1, 3)-perturbation of the minimal unitary cft, the virasoro symmetry is lost but the

81

dva symmetry remains. in the low temperature limit (x  0 with z = x2u( 1) xed
kept), w behaves as

(u)  z r

in the notation of subsection 4.2 this corresponds to (i1, i2) = (l, l + 1). we label this
ground state by an integer l (l = 1, 2,   , r  2) and m takes two values 0, 1  z/2z.
since heights on neighboring sites dier 1, we have

h(k)
l,m = 0 (m 6 l  k (mod 2)).

therefore we can identify

h(k)

careful study of the corner hamiltonian shows that the character (4.43) agrees with the
virasoro minimal unitary character [52, 9],

l,lk,k(q) = vir

l,k (q),

(5.14)

l,k (q) is given in (2.37). this character vir

where vir

should be understood as a character of the representation of dva. comparing the free

where ll,k is an irreducible dva module given in (3.82) as a cohomology of the felder
complex and d is realized in (3.43). we remark that zl,m (4.45) is in fact m-independent,
zl,0 = zl,1.

for later use we dene w ,

5.2 vertex operators

although bosons are already introduced in subsection 3.4, we present their denitions
again.

let us introduce free boson oscillator n (n  z6=0),
[rn]x
[rn]x

[n, m] =

[n]x[2n]x

n

n+m,0,

(5.18)

and use zero mode a0 and q dened in (2.49) (or a0 in (2.72)). the fock space fl,k is
dened by

fl,k =mm0 mn1nm>0

cn1    nm|l,kib,

where |ib is given by (2.51) with replacing an by hn,

a0|l,kib = (l,k  0)|l,kib, l,k  0 = r r

r  1

l +r r  1

we use also free boson oscillator n (n  z6=0),

(5.19)

(5.20)

(5.21)

(5.22)

if l and k appear in arguments of [u] and [u] respectively, they can be realized by a0,

operators l, k : fl,k  fl,k are dened by
l |fl,k = l  idfl,k ,
[u + l ] = (1)lkhu  rra0i

and they are interpreted as screening currents in subsection 3.4.

the elliptic version of vos (of type i and type ii) are dened in terms of their
trigonometric ones and a twistor given by an innite product of the universal r matrix
described in subsection 4.4 4. they satisfy the commutation relations of the type (5.33)-
(5.35) below. as we do not know how to evaluate the twistor in the bosonic realization,
we have solved the relations (5.33)-(5.35) directly for (z), (z) ( = 1). we write
(z) = 1(z) and 

1(z). we obtain the following : [21, 66]

(l = 1 + ) and take a limit   0 after all the calculation. (another method of getting rid
of this factor is a gauge transformation, see subsection 5.4.) the poles of the integrand of
(5.27)-(5.30) and the integration contours are listed in the following table. for example,

where zi = x2ui and  (u) is given in (5.136).
proof. first let us show (5.33). for (1, 2) = (1,1), (5.33) is
(z2)(z1) = (u1  u2)(z1)(z2).
this is an ope rule (5.131) itself. for (1, 2) = (1, 1), (5.33) is

+(z2)(z1) = w(cid:16) k
+w(cid:16) k

k  1

we set (see subsection 5.a)

+(z) =i dz (z)x(z)+(u, u; k),

+(u, u; k) =

2 + k]

x(z1)x(z2) = h(u1  u2)x(z2)x(z1),

h(u) =

by using ope rules in subsection 5.a, the above equation becomes

i dz (z2)(z1)x(z)+(u2, u; k + 1)f (u  u1)
= i dz (z2)(z1)x(z)w(cid:16) k
+i dz (z2)(z1)x(z)w(cid:16) k

careful analysis of the location of poles shows that we can take a common integration
contour. therefore it is sucient to compare the integrands,

k (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)u1  u2(cid:17)+(u1, u; k + 1)f (u  u2)
k (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)u1  u2(cid:17)+(u2, u; k).
k (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)u1  u2(cid:17)+(u1, u; k + 1)f (u  u2)
k (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)u1  u2(cid:17)+(u2, u; k).

k  1

+(u2, u; k + 1)f (u  u1) = w(cid:16) k
+w(cid:16) k

k + 1

k + 1

k + 1

this equation does hold by the riemann identity (a.11). (1, 2) = (1,1) case is similar.
for (1, 2) = (1, 1), (5.33) is

+(z2)+(z1) = (u1  u2)+(z1)+(z2).

by using ope rules, this becomes

i dz2i dz1 (z2)(z1)x(z2)x(z1)+(u2, u2; k  1)+(u1, u1; k)f (u2  u1)
= i dz1i dz2 (z2)(z1)x(z2)x(z1)

+(u1, u1; k  1)+(u2, u2; k)f (u1  u2)h(u1  u2).

detailed analysis of the location of poles shows that we can take a common integration
contour which is symmetric in z1 and z2. consequently it is sucient to compare the
integrands after symmetrization in z1 and z2. here symmetrization means

i dz1i dz2 x(z1)x(z2)f (u1, u2)
= i dz1i dz2 x(z1)x(z2) 1

2(cid:16)f (u1, u2) + f (u2, u1)h(u1  u2)(cid:17).

(5.39)

we remark that h(u) = h(u)1. therefore we are enough to show

+(u2, u2; k  1)+(u1, u1; k)f (u2  u1) + (u1  u2)  h(u1  u2)

= +(u1, u1; k  1)+(u2, u2; k)f (u1  u2)h(u1  u2) + (u1  u2)  h(u1  u2),

and this is correct due to the riemann identity (a.11).

next let us show (5.34). we set (see subsection 5.a)

h(u) = h(u)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)rr

,

,

and (5.17) and (5.7). integrands of (5.34) are obtained from those of (5.33) by replacement
r  r, u  u and k  l. careful analysis of the location of poles shows that we can
take a common (symmetric) integration contour for each case. therefore (5.34) holds.

(5.35) is easily shown, although we have to take care of integration contours.

the dual vos are realized in the following way,

1

(z) = q[k]
(z) = q[l ]

(x2z)q[k],
(x2z)q[l ]

1

,

(5.46)

(5.47)

and normalization constants g and g in (5.27) and (5.29) are
(x4, x2r; x4, x2r)
(x2, x2r+2; x4, x2r)

(x2, x2r, x2r; x2r)

then we have

(z)(z) = id,

x=1
2(z)1(z) = 1,2  id,

(5.53)

and for d in (3.43)

wdo(z)wd = o(wz),

for o = , , , , x.

we identify type i vos in subsection 4.2 and those here in the following way:

(5.54)

(5.55)

(5.56)

(a,a)(z) = (z)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)ll,a
(a+,a)(z) = (z)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)ll,a

,

.

then eqs. (4.106)-(4.110) correspond to (5.46),(5.33),(5.54),(5.50) and (5.51) respectively.
next let us see how the dva current is obtained from vos. let introduce free boson

oscillator hn (n  z6=0),

hn = (x  x1)(1)n [rn]x
[hn, hm] = (x  x1)2 1

[2n]x

[2n]x

n

[rn]x
[2n]x

n,

n = (x  x1)
[rn]x[rn]xn+m,0.

as explained in subsection 3.4, the dva current t (z) is realized as

t (z) = +(z) + (z),

(z) = : exp(cid:16)xn6=0

hn(x1z)n(cid:17) : xrra0.

this t (z) is obtained from type i vos by fusing them [67],

(5.57)

(5.58)

(5.59)

2(x1+rz)1(x1rz)

(z  z).

(5.61)

higher dva currents (3.132) in subsection 3.5 are also obtained by fusion,

2(x1+rjz)1(x1rjz) = 1,2( id

z )t(j)(z)aj

(j = 0)

where aj is

aj = x 1

and we have assumed that r is generic.

5.3 local height probability

let us consider local height probabilities pan,,a0(l). as remarked in subsection 5.1, we
have

pan,,a0(l) =

zl,m
zl

pan,,a0(l, m) =

1
2

pan,,a0(l, l  a0).

1xm=0

one-point lhp is already obtained in (4.44),

(5.64)

(5.65)

(5.66)

pk(l) = z1

l

[k] l,k(x4).

here the partition function zl (4.74) is

zl =

r1xk=1

[k] l,k(x4),

where l,k(q) is given in (2.37). two-point lhps satisfy recursion relations (4.66)

xa

pa,b(l) = pb(l), xb

pa,b(l) = pa(l).

(5.67)

since pa,b(l) vanishes unless |a  b| = 1 and 1  a, b  r  1, two-point lhp can be
determined uniquely by these recursion relations and expressed in terms of one-point
lhp. starting from p0,1(l) = p1,0(l) = 0, we obtain

pk+1,k(l) = pk,k+1(l) =

kxa=1

(1)kapa(l) = z1

l

kxa=1

(1)ka [a] l,a(x4),

(5.68)

and this satises pr,r1(l) = pr1,r(l) = 0 (which is equivalent to zl,0 = zl,1). pa,b(l) =
pb,a(l) agrees with physical requirement (4.112). for higher-point lhps, however, the
recursion relations can not determine them. so we will use vertex operator approach.

as explained in subsection 4.2, local height probabilities can be expressed in terms of

corner transfer matrices and type i vos. in this case (4.73) with (4.111) becomes

pan,,a0(l)
[a0] tr

= z1

(a0)

l (cid:16)x4h

(a0)

c (a0,a1)(z)   (an1,an)(z)(an ,an1)(z)   (a1,a0)(z)(cid:17).

h

we evaluate this lhp using a free eld realization of vo. our identication of the space
of state and operators are (5.15),(5.16),(5.55) and (5.56). then we have

pan,,a0(l) = z1

l

[a0] trll,a0(cid:16)x4d1(z)   n(z)n(z)   1(z)(cid:17),

where i = ai1  ai. since the type i vo has the property (5.32) (see also subsection
5.b), we can apply the formula (3.83) to the trace in the above lhp.

(5.69)

(5.70)

89

we illustrate this free eld calculation by taking two-point lhp as an example. two-

point lhp is ( = 1)

[k] trll,k(cid:16)x4d(z)(z)(cid:17)
l p[k][k  ] trll,k(cid:16)x4d(x2z)(z)(cid:17).

from (5.71), (5.48) and ope in subsection 5.a, we have

pk1,k(l)

= z1

so we have obtained an integral representation of the two-point lhp,

pk1,k(l) = z1

r k(k1)+1k.

(5.78)

(5.79)

(5.80)

next let us evaluate this integral. fl,k() has simple poles at  = x1+2n (n  z). since

ol,k() satises

ol,k(x4rm) = ol,k()2rmx4rrm2+2rm (m  z),

fl,k() has the property

fl,k(x4r) = fl,k().

(5.81)

(5.82)

consequently il,k requires some regularization. we regularize il,k in the following way,

il,k = lim
0

i 
l,k,

d  fl,k().

(5.83)

deforming the contour

i 

l,k =i=x,x3,,x4r1

and using (5.82), we obtain

i 

l,k =i||=1
d  fl,k() +i||=x4r

d  fl,k(),

(5.84)

we remark that

namely

ol,k(x1+2a) = 0.

(5.85)

(5.86)

(5.87)

using these and picking up residues at  = x, x3,   , x4r1, we obtain

pk1,k(l) =

(5.88)

we can check that this answer (and pk,k1(l) = pk1,k(l)) satises (5.67) and pl(0, 1) = 0
(use (5.87)). therefore this answer obtained by free eld approach agrees with (5.68).

for multi-point lhp (5.70), we can write down its integral representation in a similar

way. (evaluation of the integral is another problem.) see [21].

5.4 form factor

let us recall the translation invariant vacuum state (4.90)

and the action of the column-to-column transfermatrix (4.113)

|vaci =q[k] x2d,
= x=1

(z)  f  (z)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)ll,k

(cid:16)tcol(u)|fi(cid:17)(k)

(5.89)

,

(5.90)

where f is a linear map f : ll,a  ll,a.

for the time being, we consider operators on the fock spaces fl,k not on the cohomol-

ogy ll,k. action of tcol is tcol(u)|fi =p=1 (z)  f  (z). let us dene an excited

state

|wm,   , w1im,,1

= m(wm)   1(w1)|vaci : fl,k  flpi i,k.

(5.91)

(we remark that the original description of this  is   1, see (4.87).) this state is
an eigenstate of tcol

tcol(u)|wm,   , w1im,,1

(z)  m(wm)   1(w1)q[k] x2d  (z)

 (vj  u)  |wm,   , w1im,,1

,

(5.92)

= x=1
myj=1

=

where z = x2u, wj = x2vj and we have used (5.35). therefore type ii vo creates (or
annihilates) particles. but we remark that this state is a true eigenstate of tcol because
it is not a linear map on ll,k in general. we will show when this state becomes a true
eigenstate.

to avoid

how to realize the type ii vo on the cohomology is discussed in subsection 5.b.

this qa,b(l ; z|o) is uniquely determined by these recursion relations and it is expressed

x(1)m (see subsection 3.4.3). on the other hand e(w) and e(w) do not commute

with x(z) and x(z) respectively, so they are not well-dened operators on the cohomol-

brazhnikov and lukyanov [22] pointed out that one can associate to the algebra a(2)
2 a
deformed virasoro algebra which is dierent from the one discussed in section 3. we
denote it dva(a(2)

2 ).

dva(a(2)

2 ) is an associative algebra over c generated by tn (n  z) with two param-

eters x and r, and their relation is [22]

6.2 free eld realization

6.2.1 free eld realization

let us introduce free boson oscillator hn (n  z6=0),

[hn, hm] = (x  x1)2 1

n

[n]x[rn]x[(r  1)n]x

[2n]x  [n]x

n+m,0,

(6.15)

and use zero mode a0 and q dened in (2.49) (or a0 in (2.72)). notice that [2n]x  [n]x =
[3n]x[ n

2 ]x/[ 3n

the dva(a(2)

2 ]x. the fock space f is dened as before.
2 ) current t (z) is realized as follows:

t (z) = +(z) + 0(z) + (z),

(z) = : exp(cid:16)xn6=0

hn(x 3

0(z) =

: exp(cid:16)xn6=0

2 z)n(cid:17) : x2r(r1)a0,
hn(xn/2  xn/2)zn(cid:17) : .

to prove this we need (a.23) and the ope formula,

f ( w
z )(z)(w) = : (z)(w) :,
z )(z)(w) = : (z)(w) : (x1 w
f ( w
f ( w
z )0(z)0(w) = : 0(z)0(w) : ( w
z )(z)0(w) = : (z)0(w) : (x1 w
f ( w
z ),
z )0(z)(w) = : 0(z)(w) : (x1 w
f ( w
z ),

z ),

z )(x2 w

z ),

where (z) is given in (3.41). the grading operator d is realized by

d =xn>0

n2([2n]x  [n]x)

(x  x1)2[n]x[rn]x[(r  1)n]x

[d, q] = a0,

)|l,kib,

(6.16)

(6.17)

(6.18)

(6.19)

where c and hl,k are given by (2.17) and (2.18) respectively. we remark that et (z) =

+(z) + 0(z)  (z) also satises (6.1).

|ib is the highest weight state of dva with  = (),

|ib = |()i,

.

(6.20)

(6.21)

102

the dual space f becomes a dva module by (2.63) with

ttn = tn,
thn = hn,

eq.(2.66),

and (2.67). by (6.23), f is isomorphic to f20 as dva module,

f = f20
|ib  |20  ib.

(dva module).

(6.22)

(6.23)

(6.24)

(6.25)

note that () = (20  ) by (6.21).

in the conformal limit (x = e  1, r : xed), oscillator hn is expressed by an in

(2.49) as follows:

hn = p2r(r  1)s

1

xn  1 + xn

xrn  xrn

2rn

x(r1)n  x(r1)n

2(r  1)n

an.

(6.26)

substituting this expression into (6.16) and expanding in , we get (6.9) with l(z) in
(2.55) (or (2.73)).

the representation with  = l,k is realized on fl,k = fl,k,

l,k = (l,k),

(6.27)

where l,k is given in (2.79).

6.2.2 kac determinant

in the free boson realization the singular vectors can be expressed by screening currents.
a screening current x+(z) is dened by
n
[n]x

2(r1) qz r

(6.28)

2(r1) a0+ r

2(r1) ,

x+(z) =: exp(cid:16)xn6=0

zn(cid:17) : e r

where oscillators n (n  z6=0) are related to hn as

hn = (x  x1)(1)n [(r  1)n]x
[2n]x  [n]x

n.

(6.29)

like as (3.61) singular vector is obtained by the brst operator. screening charges and
brst charges will be discussed in the next subsection.

like as in subsection 3.4.2 let us introduce matrices c(n, ) and c(n, ) by (3.63)

and (3.64). then their determinants are given by

lkn(cid:18)(cid:16)z

2 x

2 l(r1)kr + z 1

2 x 1

where z = x2r(r1)(0). the inner product of two states in the verma module is given
by (3.67) where gk,l is

and its determinant is (use (a.28) and (a.30))

(cid:19)ki

ki!,

(xri  xri)(x(r1)i  x(r1)i)

6.2.3 felder complex

we consider the representation of  = l,k in (6.27) with (2.20) and (2.23), i.e.

let us consider the felder complex cl,k,

r =

2p

where cj and xj

x2 c1

we assume that p is odd (we have not obtained the result for general even p). brst
charge qm (1  m  p  1) is dened by

x satises the brst property,

xjxj1 = 0.

(6.41)

(6.42)

(6.43)

(6.44)

we assume that this felder complex has the same structure as the virasoro case because
it formally tends to virasoro one in the conformal limit (x  1 and r and z = x2u xed
kept). then the cohomology groups of the complex cl,k are

h j(cl,k) = ker xj/im xj1 =( 0

ll,k

j 6= 0,
j = 0,

(6.45)

where ll,k is the irreducible dva module of  = l,k. the trace of operator o over ll,k
can be written as (3.83).

the brst charge commutes with dva [46]

[tn, ql] = 0 on fl,k

l  l (mod p).

(6.46)

singular vector can be obtained by ql like as (3.61).

6.3 dilute al models

in the following we x a positive integer l  3. the dilute al model [68, 69] is an
integrable rsos model obtained by restricting the face model of type a(2)
[70]. in the
2

105

dilute al model, the local uctuation variables a, b,   take one of the l states 1, 2,   , l,
and those on neighboring lattice sites are subject to the condition a  b = 0,1. the
boltzmann weights can be found in [69], eq.(3.1). for our purpose it is convenient to use
the parametrization given in appendix a of [69], which is suitable in the low-temperature
regime. with some change of notation we recall the formula below [46].

let x = e2/, r = /(2) and u = uorig/(2), where ,  are the variables used in
[69] and uorig stands for u there. we shall restrict ourselves to the regime 2+ dened
by

0 < x < 1,

r = 2

< u < 0.

(6.47)

l + 1

we have taken p = l, p = l + 1 in (6.35), which corresponds to minimal unitary series.
(6.7) and (6.8) become

 =

l + 1

l

, 0 =

and we set

,

pl(l + 1)
r = r  1.

p = l,

p = l + 1,

(6.48)

(6.49)

on the critical point (x  1), this model is described by cft, i.e. the minimal uni-
tary series with  = l+1
l . on the o-critical point (x < 1), which corresponds to the
(1, 2)-perturbation of the minimal unitary cft, the virasoro symmetry is lost but the
dva(a(2)
2 ) symmetry remains. changing an overall scalar factor we put the boltzmann
weights in the form

where (u) is given in (6.126) and chosen so that the partition function per site of the
model equals to 1. w is

along with the additive variable u, we often use the multiplicative variable z = x2u. for
later use we dene w ,

in this gauge w enjoys also a reection symmetry

where (u) is given in (6.127).

hereafter we assume that l is odd. the model has ground states labeled by odd
integers l = 1, 3,   , l  2 [69]. they are characterized as congurations in which all
heights take the same value b. if l = 4n  1, then the possible values are b = l (1  l 
2n  1, l : odd) or b = l + 1 (2n + 1  l  l  2, l : odd). therefore in the notation of
subsection 4.2 we have (i1) = (b), m = 0  z/z and h(k)
l,0 . in the thermodynamic
limit ctms (4.100) become

l = h(k)

a(k)(u) = c (k)(u) = x2uh (k)

careful study of the corner hamiltonian shows that the character (4.43) coincides with
the virasoro minimal unitary character [69],

again. recall that

r = r  1.

and use zero mode a0 and q dened in (2.49) (or a0 in (2.72)). the fock space fl,k is
dened by

fl,k =mm0 mn1nm>0

(6.58),(6.59),(6.86) and (6.87).

one-point lhp is already obtained in (4.44),

(6.94)

(6.95)

which can be expressed in product of theta functions with conjugate modulus [69]. two-
point lhp satises (4.112) and (4.66)

pa,b(l) = pb,a(l), xb

pa,b(l) = pa(l).

(6.96)

in contrast to subsection 5.3, however, this recursion relation does not determine pa,b(l)
uniquely. so we will use free eld realization of vertex operator approach. two-point
lhp pk,k(l) is ( = 0,1)

pk,k(l) = z1

in this lecture we have explained deformed virasoro algebras (a(1)
1

type and a(2)
2

type)

and elliptic quantum groups (face type algebra bq,(g) and vertex type algebra aq,p(bsln))

and studied solvable lattice models (abf model in regime iii and dilute al model in
regime 2+) by using vertex operators and free eld realizations.

we close this lecture by mentioning some related topics.

in cft there are several extensions of the virasoro al-
deformed w algebras (dwas):
gebra, e.g. superconformal algebras, current algebras (ane lie algebras), w algebras,
parafermions, which contain the virasoro algebra as a subalgebra. for w algebras, see
review [71]. wn algebra is a w algebra associated to an1 algebra. deformation of
wn algebra, which we denote dwa(an1), was obtained in [18](see also [72]) and [20]
by using correspondence between singular vectors and macdonald symmetric polynomi-
als or quantization of the deformed wn poisson algebra respectively. the deformed wn

poisson algebra was obtained from the wakimoto realization of uq(bsln ) at the critical

level by e. frenkel and reshetikhin [19] and they pointed out that deformed w cur-
rents in a free eld realization have the same forms of transfer matrices in analytic bethe
ansatz, dressed vacuum form. (bethe ansatz is also a powerful method to study solvable
models [6, 73]) based on this observation, dwas for arbitrary simple lie algebras were

constructed [74]. see [75] for screening currents, [76] for relation to aq,p(bsln ), [77] for

connection to q-dierence version of the drinfeld-sokorov reduction, and see [78, 79, 46]
for higher currents. dwa(an1) appears in the a(1)
n1 face model [80, 75] and also in
the abf model in regime ii [81]. since a(1)
and a(2)
are the only ane lie algebras
2
1
of rank 1, those dwa closes for one current t (z), i.e. dva. in cft, wn algebra does
not contain wn (n  n) algebra as a subalgebra explicitly except for n = 2 case which
in deformed case, dwa(an1) does not contain
corresponds to the virasoro algebra.

116

even dva(a(1)
1 ) explicitly. as shortly explained in subsection 2.2.3, singular vectors of
virasoro and w algebras imply that the correlation functions containing corresponding
primary elds satisfy the dierential equations. for singular vectors of dva and dwa,
do the correlation functions satisfy some dierence equations?

in cft wess-zumino-novikov-witten (wznw) model has
kz and q-kz equations :
gauge symmetries, i.e. ane lie algebra symmetries [2]. virasoro current is realized as a
quadratic form of ane lie algebra currents (sugawara construction). consequently con-
formal ward identity has rich structure, which is known as the knizhnik-zamolodchikov
(kz) equation [82, 83]. since the virasoro algebra is a lie algebra, we know a rule for
its tensor product representation. moreover we obtain new realizations and character for-
mulas of the virasoro algebra by coset construction [84]. on the other hand dva is not
a lie algebra and its tensor product representation is unknown. (we remark that tensor
product representations of wn algebras in cft are also unknown.) if there exists some
deformation of the sugawara construction, it could give tensor product representations of
dva but we do not know it at present. rather we derive dva or dwa from (elliptic)
quantum groups by fusion of vos [67]. q-deformation of kz equation were presented
by i. frenkel and reshetikhin [59]. q-kz equations are holonomic q-dierence equations
for the matrix coecients of the products of intertwining operators for representations
of quantum ane algebra. connection matrix of their solutions gives a face type elliptic
solution of ybe. see [59, 85, 86, 16, 60].

massive integrable models :
integrable perturbations of cft were studied in [12, 13,
14, 15] and (1, 3)-perturbed cft is described by the sine-gordon model. sine-gordon
model is a typical massive integrable model. s-matrix was obtained by zamlodochikovs
bootstrap approach [4]. for form factors see smirnovs bootstrap approach [87] (see also
[88]). lukyanov pointed out that dva(a(1)
1 ) current t (z) in certain scaling limit gives the
zamolodchikov-faddeev (zf) algebra of sine-gordon model (before taking a scaling limit,
t (z) is interpreted as the zf algebra for basic scalar excitation of xyz spin chain) [89].
in section 3, z of t (z) is introduced as a formal parameter, but here z of t (z) is related to
the spectral parameter of the particle, like as lattice models in section 4, 5 (z = x2u). this
is contrasted with the cft case, where z of l(z) is interpreted as a complex coordinate of
the riemann surface. we can obtain integrable massive eld theory models from solvable
lattice models by taking appropriate scaling limit. particles in a eld theory are created
by type ii vos. for xxz model, sine-gordon model, bullough-dodd model and ane
toda model see [90, 66, 22, 91, 92]. field theory analog of transfer matrix and baxters
q-operator is studied in [93].

eight vertex model : abf model was studied by lukyanov and pugai by bosonization of
type i vos. an algebraic approach to the fusion abf models was presented in [55, 61] on

117

the basis of the quasi-hopf algebra bq,(bsl2) and the elliptic algebra uq,p(bsl2). bosoniza-

tion of vos for the a(1)
n1 face model was given in [80]. another interesting direction is
to study baxters eight vertex model and belavins generalization. lashkevich and pugai
proposed a remarkable bosonization formula of the type i vo for the eight vertex model
[94]. they succeeded in reducing the problem to the already known bosonization for the
abf model through the use of intertwining vectors and lukyanovs screening operators.
to understand their bosonization scheme, it seems necessary to clarify the relationship be-

tween the intertwining vectors and the two twistors f () and e(r), which dene bq,(bsln)
and aq,p(bsln) respectively. it is also interesting to seek a more direct bosonization, which
is intrinsically connected with the quasi-hopf structure of aq,p(bsl2) and does not rely on

the bosonization of the abf model.

supersymmetry :
in string theory supersymmetries are essential to cancelation of diver-
gence and consistency of theory, and n = 2 superconformal algebra is related to many
interesting topics, e.g. chiral ring, mirror symmetry, topological eld theory. are there
good deformations of superconformal algebras? super version (z2 graded algebra) of
elliptic quantum group was formulated in [95] along the line of [26] (see also [96]). can
we obtain deformed superconformal currents by fusion of vos of this elliptic superalgebra

or higher level vos of uq(bsl2) [97] ? see also [98].

as explained in the introduction our motivation is to nd the symmetry of massive
integrable models, but present status is far from satisfactory. we hope that this lecture
can help the study in this (and also other) eld.

a.5 hausdor formula

for two operators a and b, we have a formula

eabea = eadab,

(ada)b = [a, b],

(a.49)

because two functions of t, etabeta and etad ab, satisfy the same dierential equation
f(t) = af (t)  f (t)a and the same initial condition f (0) = b. when a and [a, b]
commute each other, we have eabea = b +[a, b] and so eaebea = eb+[a,b]. therefore
we have a formula

[a, [a, b]] = [b, [a, b]] = 0 = eaeb = e[a,b]ebea,

(a.50)

which is a special case of the campbell-baker-hausdor formula eaeb = ea+b+ 1
2 [a,b]+.
a harmonic oscillator [a, a] = 1 and this formula are basic tools of free eld realization.

a.6

trace technique

let us consider one free boson oscillator, [a, a] = 1. the fock space f is generated by |0i
(a|0i = 0), and its orthonormal basis is |ni = 1n!
a n|0i (n  0). a trace over the fock
space (trfo =pn0hn|o|ni) can be expressed as a vacuum to vacuum amplitude. let

us introduce another oscillator b, [b, b] = 1, which commute with a and satisfy b|0i = 0.
then we have the following clavelli-shapiros trace formula [100],

trf(cid:16)yaao(a, a)(cid:17) =

1

1  yh0|o(d, d)|0i.

where a, b are constants.

for readers convenience, we give three direct proofs of (a.53).

(i) the rst method uses a cyclic property of trace. we have

f (a, b) = trf(cid:16)yaaeaaeba(cid:17) (|y| < 1)

= trf(cid:16)eayayaaeba(cid:17) = trf(cid:16)yaaebaeaya(cid:17)
= eaby trf(cid:16)yaaeayaeba(cid:17) = eabyf (ay, b),

124

here d, d are

especially we have

d =

1
1  y

a + b,

d = a +

trf(cid:16)yaaeaaeba(cid:17) =

b,

[d, d ] = 1.

eab y

(a.51)

(a.52)

(a.53)

(a.54)

and

f (a, b) = eab trf(cid:16)yaaebaeaa(cid:17) = eab trf(cid:16)eby1ayaaeaa(cid:17)

= eab trf(cid:16)yaaeaaeby1a(cid:17) = eabf (a, by1).

(a.55)

(a.54) implies

and (a.55) implies

f (a, b) = eab(y+y2+)f (ay, b) = eab y

1y f (0, b),

f (0, b) = f (0, by) = f (0, by) = f (0, 0).

1y , we obtain (a.53).

since f (0, 0) = 1
(ii) the second method uses a coherent state |) = ea|0i (  c), which satises a|) =
|), (|) = e  and the completeness condition 1 =pn0 |nihn| =r d2
 e||2|)(|,

where d2 = d1d2 with  = 1 + i2. the trace becomes

trf(cid:16)yaaeaaeba(cid:17) =z d2



e||2

(|yaaeaaeba|).

since (|yaaeaaeba|) = eb(|yaaeaa|) = eb(|yaa| + a) = eb(|y( + a)) =
ebe y(+a), by completing the square and performing the gauss integral, we obtain the
result.
(iii) the third method is a direct calculation.
