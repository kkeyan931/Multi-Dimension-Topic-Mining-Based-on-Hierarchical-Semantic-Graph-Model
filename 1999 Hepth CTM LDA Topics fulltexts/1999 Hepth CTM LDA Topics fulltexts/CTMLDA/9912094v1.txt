abstract

here we examine the noncommutative counterpart of qed, which is called as noncom-
mutative qed. the theory is obtained by examining the consistent minimal coupling to
noncommutative u(1) gauge eld. the -product admits the coupling of the matter with
only three varieties of charges, i.e., 0, +1 and 1. the ultraviolet divergence of noncommu-
tative qed can be absorbed by redenition of the theory at one loop level. to examine the
infrared aspect of the theory the anomalous magnetic moment is calculated. its depedence
on the direction of photon momentum reects the lorentz symmetry violation of the system.
the explicit calculation of the nite part of the vacuum polarization shows the presence of
hard infrared singularity like 1/(q  c t c  q) (c  is a noncommutative parameter.) which
also exists in noncommutative yang-mills theory. it might indicate the potential between the
static charges dumps promptly faster than in ordinary qed. we also consider the extension
to chiral gauge theory in the present context, but the requirement of anomaly cancellation
allows only noncommutative qed.

introduction

noncommutative yang-mills theory attracts ones interest after it emerged in the bps solu-
tion of matrix theory [1, 2], and is realized as the eective theory around one of the perturbative
vacua of superstring theory with constant b background [3]. prior to such recent development
noncommutative geometry and the construction of eld theory has been developed [4] to de-
scribe a world with a fuzzy structure by deforming the algebra of functions. although the
noncommutative geometry appearing in the context of perturbative superstring theory does not
seem to have connection with quantum gravity, the general noncommutative geometry may ac-
comodate the essential ingredients of quantum geometry (which we do not know at present)
by its new machienary. assuming the latter fact we are naturally inclined to investigate the
quantum mechanical aspect of the theory dened on the noncommutative geometry in order to
argue whether it really reects the miscroscopic structure of our world. but the rst thing to

do is to analyze the simplest toy model and know that the theory is well dened even in the
ultraviolet region. it is the most important subject to know how the infrared physics is aected,
and whether it provides more desirable fundation for contructing the concrete model.
since it appears in string theory, noncommutative yang-mills (ncym) theory is widely dis-
cussed. the realization of such a theory on the set of the ordinal functions modies the product
of two functions in terms of stared (mentionded hereafter as *-) product. here we consider
how the matter eld couples to yang-mills eld in such a manner that the theory respects this
rule of product as well as the gauge symmetry. the simplest such a candiate would be a non-
commutative counterpart of qed, in which electron with a denite charge is present. as will
be shown in sec. 2 inclusion of matters does not have so many varieties. in spite of the base
manifold considered here being topologically trivial, charge is limited to three varieties; 0, 1 and
1, the precise meaning of which is dened in sec. 2. this is stronger requirement than the
charge quantization on compact manifold such as torus. we expect that there would be hilbert
space realization for the theory with the elds of charge  1 on noncommutative goemetry and
a mapping rule to the function space on the usual coordinates as was found in ncym theory.
thus we call the elds with charge +1 as electron and the theory including such a object
and photon as noncommutative qed (nc-qed) in this paper. note that the massive scalar
elds receive quadratic divergence which leads us to lose control of ultraviolet (uv) divergence
unless supersymmetry forbids its appearance. contrarily the usual fermion mass receives only
logarithmic divergence in four-dimensional qed or qcd. nonlocal generalization of the interac-
tions is then expected not to drastically modify the divergent structure as experienced in ncym
system, which also needs further clarication. thus here the system involving fermions with
charges 1 is examined primarily.
although ncym system is related to ordinary yang-mills system by rather complex map [5],
there would be nontrivial quantum mechanical dynamics in ncym without maximal super-
symmetry. one aspect of ncym theory has been arugued to describe the large n ordinary
yang-mills theory with a xed thooft coupling constant in the high momentum region [6]. it
relies on the diagramatic expansion and the pattern of momentum-dependent phase factors ap-
pearing in the theories. more direct connection through the correlators of the gauge invariant
operators is welcome in spite of curious nature of general wilson loop operators in noncommu-
tative yang-mills theory [6, 7, 8]. but it is beyond our present scope.
in order to access to the infrared side, the rst thing we can do is to investigate the perturbative
aspects. the perturbative analysis on uv structure of ncym theory has been done in ref.
[9, 10]. the infrared side on ncym as well as nc-qed is our primary concern. naive continu-
ation of asymptoticcally free nature [9] indicates the existence of such a dynamical scale as qcd
at which the coupling constant diverges while naive commutative limit reduces to abelian gauge
theory. the renormalization refers to the structures much higher than noncommutative energy
scale, so it is natural that the commutative limit of the renormalized theory do not reduce it
back to its commutative counterpart. we would like to begin in this paper with seeking the
dynamics which could not be reached in local eld theory, by rst examining a simple model,
nc-qed.
the paper is organized as follows: sec. 2 is conerned with construction of classical action
involving the matter elds and showing that the allowed choice is quite limited.
in sec. 3
noncommutative qed theory is quantized and the anomalous magnetic dipole moment is cal-
cualted to see whether the radiative eect from noncommutative extension appears in the nite
quantities. there the infrared behavior is further investigated by observing the nite part of the

2

vacuum polaization of photon. there a hard infrared singularity is found. such a singularity
also exists in ncym theory. it suggests duality between the infrared and uv sides of the
theory. the extension to the chiral gauge theory is also examined in sec.4, but it is found that
there is no chiral gauge theory. sec. 5 is devoted to the discussion and conclusion of the present
paper.

2 noncommutative qed

pure noncommutative u(1) yang-mills action

sy m = z ddx (cid:18)

1

4g2(cid:19) f  f  ,

(1)

(space-time dimension d is set equal to four in nal.) is nothing but the one obtained from the
ordinary su(n) yang-mills action by replacing the matrix multiplication to the star (hereafter
referred as -)product

a  b(x)  e

1

,

(2)

2i c  ()

 ()

 a(x + ) b(x + )(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12),0

with an antisymmetric matrix c  which characterizes noncommutativity of space-time by mod-
ifying the algebra of functions. even in u(1) case a couples to itself since the eld strength
f of a has the nonlinear term

f = a  a + [a, a]m ,

where [a, b]m denotes moyal bracket:

[a, b]m = a  b  b  a .

(3)

(4)

the -product obeys the associative law which is also satised by the matrix algebra so that
the manipulation in this case resembles the one experienced in the calculus of matrix. thus it
is quite simple to see the action (1) is invariant under

a(x)  a(x) = u (x)  a(x)  u 1(x) + iu (x)  u 1(x) ,

(5)

where u (x) = (ei(x)) is dened by an innite series expansion of multiple -product of scalar
function (x). u 1(x) = (ei(x)) is similarly dened and plays the role of the inverse of u (x).
here and hereafter we assume that the elds decrease so promptly at innity that the space-time
integral of a moyal bracket (which corresponds to the trace of the commutator in the matrix
language) vanishes.
the coupling of electron to gauge eld in noncommutative u(1) yang-mills theory receives
a severe restriction. the gauge transformation (5) for the gauge eld shows that the simple
candidate of the interaction (x)  a(x) or a(x)   implies that  and  must transform as

(x)  (x) = u (x)  (x) ,

(x)  (x) = (x)  u (x)1 ,

(6)

respectively in order for each product with gauge eld to transform in the same way as the
original eld. the covariant derivative

d =   ia  , d  =   + i   a ,

(7)

3

also transforms covariantly in the same way as the original objects. since the commutative limit
leads to the elds with +1 charge and 1 charge respectively in ordinary qed, so we call the
eld  in the above a eld with +1 charge and referred hereafter as electron (opposite to the
usual convention). then the action

smatter = z ddx(cid:0)   id  m   (cid:1) ,

(8)

is invariant under local u(1) symmetry since  1 behaves in the same manner as . the eld with
charge +1(1) in noncommutative case would correspond to (anti-)fundamental representation
in ordinary nonabelian gauge theory. it is also reminiscent of such features that noncommuta-
tive gauge theory carries the internal degrees of freedom by imbedding them into the space-time
geometry itself. this is the reverse process of the reduction of the space-time degrees of freedom
into the internal ones in the large n gauge theory [11]. when we pursue this correspondence
further, we are inclined to guess that the higher-rank representation of su(n) gauge theory may
convert into some matter elds in noncommutative gauge theory. it would be the counterpart
of the elds of integral multiple of unit charge from the view point of noncommutative gener-
alization of u(1) gauge theory. actually the adjoint representation corresponds to a eld (x)
with zero charge in total but transforming in the by-product form

(x)  (x) = u (x)  (x)  u 1(x) .

(9)

its covariant derivative is given by moyal bracket. however we cannot nd the counterpart
of the second-rank antisymmetric representation, etc, of su(n) gauge theory. the -product
admits only the elds with charge 0, +1 or 1. as a by-product the vacuum expectation value
of wilson loop operator for a rectangular loop becomes associated with the ground state energy
acting between two sources of charges, +1 and 1, as usual.

3 perturbative aspects in infrared side

we are interested in the quantum mechanical aspect of the theory dened by the sum of (1)

and (8)

sncqed = z ddx (cid:18)

1

4g2 f  f  +   id  m   (cid:19) .

(10)

as explicit computation shows, the integral over the loop momentum can be dened only in the
restricted kinematical region if the component of c  on a plane including the time direction is
nonzero. this would have the common origin of the critical electric eld of string theory with
electric eld background [12]. thus we consider the theory with nonzero c 23 but zero c 01 in
the canonical basis for antisymmetric matrix c .
perturbation theory begins with rescaling a  ga and gauge xing. brst quantization as
in ordinary qcd theory leads the gauge xing and faddeev-popov (fp) terms

sgf = z ddx(cid:18)

space. thus  = 0.

quantization is dened by perturbative expansion due to feynman rule as was done for ncym
theory in ref. [9], but now derive from the actions (10) and (11)
the extra ultraviolet divergent contributions arise in addition to those already appearing in
ncym theory. as we concentrate on reporting on the infrared phenomena in this short article,
we postpone to describe the detail about ultraviolet divergence at one-loop level to the future
extended volume [13], and state the results only in brief: all the one loop ultraviolet divergence
can be subtracted by the local counterterms with maintaining the equalities among various z
factors (wave function renormalization constant, etc.) required from gauge invariance. the 
function becomes for nf number of copies of electron elds

a contribution 22
3 is due to the structure similar to nonabelian dynamics, su(2) yang-mills
theory [9]. however the matter contribution is that found in ordinary qed theory with unit
charge, not that of the quarks belonging to the fundamental representation of su(2) gauge the-
ory (in which 2
in this analysis there is an important feature that should be kept in mind for the analysis of
infrared aspect of the theory. only planar diagrams can have overall divergence. noncommu-
tativity of the theory manifests itself in the form of a momentum-dependent phase associated
with the vertex in feynman rule. planar diagram is a portion of the contributions which has
a denite phase factor, but it only depends on the external momenta, not on any loop momenta.
once loop momentum enters in the phase factor, the suppression factor which depend on the
external momentum through c  is always induced. this is the same feature already shared by
ncym theory [14, 6].
to observe an infrared aspects of the theory, the leading correction to magnetic dipole coupling
is estimated. the extraction of dipole coupling in the  a vertex function yields

where x = (q2)(cid:8)(+ + )2m2 + +(q2)(cid:9). since k1(x)  1

x for x  0 we can take q2 and
q2 2 to zero without confronting with any singularities. thus for q2 = 0 and q2 = 0, h(1, p, q) is
equal to h(0, p, q). therefore the leading correction to the magnetic dipole moment is the same
for ordinary qed and nc-qed. but the non-zero photon momentum in the direction transverse
to (2, 3) plane is allowed. eq. (13) shows that the strength of magnetic dipole coupling is aected
for such a photon in general.
we examine the infrared behavior of the renormalized vertex functions, especially the vacuum
polarization for photon. as the analysis is lacking even for ncym theory 3, the common
contributions, the fp-ghost loop, gauge boson loop are examined here. taking feynman gauge
for simplicity, they can be written in terms of schwinger parameterization [17]

at rst glance such a singularity (|x  y|2
t in coordinate space where the norm siginied by a
subscript t is the length along (2,3)-plane.) conicts with the slavnov-taylor identity naively
derived from brst symmetry of the system. thus we do not convince ourselves that such a
singularity is real or an artifact of the dimensional regularization which might be insucient
to pertain the gauge symmetry in the infrared region. before proceeding further analysis on
nc-qed, this point needs to be claried.

(22)

4 chiral gauge theory

until now all the fermions are assumed to be dirac fermions.

it is naturally tempted to
pursue the extension to chiral gauge theory. the classical analysis given in sec. 2 is irrelevant
to the chiral property of fermion. thus weyl fermions can have the charge +1 or 1. the
right-handed fermion with +1 charge is easily seen to be replaced by its cp conjugate (the left-
handed) fermion also in the present context. the chiral gauge theory simply implies that the
number of the left-handed fermions with +1 charge is not equal to one with 1. the question is
whether such a theory can circumvent a triangle loop anomaly to dene a consistent quantum
theory or not.
it is quite an easy excise to see the triangle loop diagram is planar. the phase e i
2 q1c q2 depend
only on the external photon momenta. thus a triangle fermion loop diagram gives only planar
contributions. once we remind the correspondence between the current theory to ordinary

7

nonabelian gauge system in which the external momentum plays the role of color in yang-
mills theory, the remained integral is evaluated completely in the same manner as encountered
in ordinary nonabelian gauge theory involving the fundamental and/or anti-fundamental weyl
fermions. from this observation, the number of the left-handed fermions with 1 charge has to
match with the number of fermions with +1 in the system 4. such a theory is vector-like, i.e.,
noncommutative qed considered until the present sections.

5 conclusion

in this paper we attempt to nd the noncommutative analogue of qed and argue the per-
turbative aspects of its infrared dynamics. the anomalous magnetic dipole moment does not
change at leading order for the photon moving in the direction along which noncommutativity
is irrelevant. however the form factor seems to indicate the possible observation of lorentz
invariance so(1,3) by controlling the direction of photon although the conventinal environment
of measurement averages over the directions of photon. in order to discuss quantum aspects
of the theory, it would be the best to calculate and investigate the radiatively corrected cross
sections for compton, or mller scattering, or the photon-electron, photon-photon scattering
processes with explicity specied helicities of the external states.
however before doing that we have to obtain a conclusive evidence of the hard singularity like
1/q2 encountered in the vacuum polarization of photon. such a singularity exists also in ncym
theory and may reect some dual role of q and the original momentum q. dyson resummation
of such one particle irreducible contributions gives to the photon propagator 5

ig
q2 + c0

ig (q2)

.

(23)

thus the infrared side will also be in the week coupling regime as in the ultraviolet side (as long
as  function in eq. (12) is negative). the form of the propagator indicates that some anomalous
violation mechanism might occur. there would happen a crossover phenomena around noncom-
mutative scale, and results in duality between the infrared and the uv regions.
the requirement of anomalous diagrams being cancelled in total is too strong for chiral gauge
theory to emerge in the present context. it is an interesting and important subject to relax the
requirement of such a complete cancellation.

note added

during preparation of the paper, we nd a preprint [16] reported a few days ago, which discussed
the subject partly overlapping with the present paper. there it was concluded that the hard
singularity like 1/q2 does not occur, contrarily to the present paper. as we do not know their
detail computation, it needs some time to clarify such discrepancy, for instance, to analyse the
euclidean theory compactitied on torus. there will be a subtlety to argue the infrared limit

4 we require that the triangular loop contribution cancels with each other for all momentum conguration.
but it might be too strong requirement for noncommutative su(n) gauge theory due to non-factorizability of
color and phase factors, as suggested by y. kitazawa.

5 the follwing argument is crude since it neglects the fact that there also appear logarithmic singularities

about q2 in the vacuum polarization.
