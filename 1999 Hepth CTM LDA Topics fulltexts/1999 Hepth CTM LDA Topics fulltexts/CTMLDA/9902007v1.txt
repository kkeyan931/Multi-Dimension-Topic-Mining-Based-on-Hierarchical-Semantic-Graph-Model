abstract

the motion of a particle near the rn black hole horizon is described
by conformal mechanics. models of this type have no ground state with
vanishing energy. this problem was resolved in past by a redenition of
the hamiltonian which breaks translational time invariance but gives a nor-
malizable ground state. we show that this change of the hamiltonian is a
quantum mechanical equivalent of the change of coordinates near the black
hole horizon removing the singularity. the new hamiltonian of quantum
mechanics is identied as an operator of a rotation between 2 time-like co-
ordinates of the ads hypersurface which translates global time. therefore
conformal quantum mechanics may eventually help to resolve the puzzles of
the classical black hole physics.

1. recently a surprising connection [1] between black holes and conformal
mechanics of de alfaro, fubini and furlan [2] (dff) and superconformal [3]
mechanics have been established1. the dynamics of a (super)particle near
the horizon of an extreme reissner-nordstrom black hole was shown to be
governed by an action that reduces to a (super)conformal mechanics model
in the limit of a large black hole charge. the hamiltonian, and the rest of
the generators of the conformal group were found in [1] to be equal to

h =

p2
2f

+

g

2x2f

,

k = f

x2
2

,

d =

xp + px

4

.

(1)

here the function f (x, p) in the limit of the large black hole charge q tends
to 1 and we nd a complete agreement with the conformal model [2] in this
limit. such models upon quantization give the commutators of the conformal
algebra

[h, d] = ih ,

[k, d] = ik ,

[h, k] = 2id .

(2)

this quantum mechanical model was shown in [2] to a have a continuous
spectrum of energy eigenstates with energy eigenvalue e > 0, but there is
no ground state at e = 0.

in ref.

[1] a black hole interpretation of this model was suggested. the
classical analog of an eigenstate of h is an orbit of a timelike killing vector
eld k, equal to /t in the region outside the horizon, and the energy is
then the value of k2. the absence of a ground state of h at e = 0 can now
be interpreted as due to the fact that the orbit of k with k2 = 0 is a null
geodesic generator of the event horizon, which is not covered by the static
coordinates adapted to t.

the procedure used by dff to cure the problem of the absence of a
ground state was to choose a dierent combination of conserved charges as
the hamiltonian. from the perspective of the quantum mechanics this shift
of the hamiltonian is unusual and motivated by the fact that when the
theory does not have a ground state, an additional prescription may be used
such that the new theory has a well dened vacuum. it has been realized
that such additional prescription leads to the breakdown of time translational
invariance in favor of maintaining a well-dened vacuum and an anti de sitter
group.

1various aspects of black holes and ads2/cf t1 duality were studied in [4].

1

from the perspective of the particle motion near the black hole horizon,
the procedure adopted in [2] is extremely well motivated. it was stated in [1]
that it corresponds to a dierent choice of time, one for which the worldlines
of static particles pass through the black hole horizon instead of remaining
in the exterior spacetime.

2. we will discuss here the connection between the black hole horizon
and absence of a normalizable lowest eigenstate of a quantum mechanical
hamiltonian in more detail. by studying the conformal quantum mechanics
dff reached the conclusion that the hamiltonian of the conformal quantum
mechanics is not acceptable for solving the problem of motion. they sug-
gested to solve the problem of motion to use a compact operator l0, which is
not a hamiltonian but a combination of the hamiltonian h and conformal
operator k,

l0 =

1

2 (cid:18) 1

a

k + ah(cid:19) =

a

4   x2

a2 + p2 +

g

x2! .

(3)

this compact operator was shown to exhibit the pleasant features of having
a discrete spectrum and normalizable eigenstates. here a is a constant (with
dimension of length) whose introduction breaks scale invariance. the action
is scale invariant but the ground state is not, so that one may qualify this as
a spontaneous breaking of scale invariance.

it has been conjectured in [2] that the constant a may have a fundamental
meaning since it provides a sort of infra-red cut-o responsible for the good
behaviour at large distances and the discrete spectrum. in fact it was found
in [2] that from three independent operators h, k, d only one combination
can be made which corresponds to a generator of a compact rotation. the
other two operators,

l =

1

2 (cid:18) 1

a

k  ah(cid:19)  id

(4)

correspond to hyperbolic non-compact transformations. the algebra of con-
formal generators h, k, d generators was replaced by the algebra of their
linear combination,

[l0, l] = l ,

[l+, l] = 2l0 .

(5)

2

the eigenvalues and eigenstates of the operator l0 have been found and l
were treated as raising and lowering operators. the eigenvalues of l0 are
given by a discrete series rn = r0 + n where r0 = 1

the superconformal mechanics [3] faced the analogous problems of the
absence of the well dened ground state and therefore in supersymmetric
case the same approach as in non-supersymmetric case was developed, i.e.
the shift of the hamiltonian was performed. moreover in the fermionic part
it was necessary to nd the appropriate combinations of supersymmetry and
special conformal supersymmetry to provide the existence of the ground state
with the vanishing energy.

2(1 +qg + 1/4).

the worrisome part of this procedure invented 22 years ago was the break-
down of time translational invariance which in a quantum mechanical system
in the at space is not clearly justied (apart from the fact that it helps to
nd the vacuum and the physical states of the theory).

dff procedure of an unusual but successful treatment of conformal quan-
tum mechanics comes out in a new light from the ads/cft perspective. the
main dierence with the old picture is that we start with the curved space
of a black hole where it is not known how to describe quantum mechani-
cally the motion of a particle near the horizon and in the black hole interior.
however, the fact that the time translational symmetry is broken in the co-
ordinate system where the horizon looks like a singularity is not surprising
at all! quite opposite, there is no translational symmetry in this situation in
curved space since near the horizon the time coordinate is ill dened, as will
be shown below in detail.

note that in classical general relativity as dierent from quantum me-
chanics it is a standard procedure to demonstrate that the horizon is not a
true singularity by changing the coordinate system.

3. let us recall here the following [5] ads-type explanation as to why
the extreme black hole horizon is not a true singularity. the metric of the
extreme rn metric in isotropic coordinates is

ds2 =  1 +

|q|lp

 !2

dt2 + 1 +

|q|lp

 !2

[d2 + 2d2] ,

(6)

where q is the black hole charge, lp is the plank length ,d2 = d2 +
sin2  d2 is the so(3)-invariant metric on s2, and m = |q|/lp is the black

3

hole mass. the near-horizon (or large charge) geometry is therefore

ds2 =   

qlp!2

 !2
dt2 +  qlp

d2 + (qlp )2d2 ,

(7)

which is the bertotti-robinson (br) metric. it can be characterized as the
so(1, 2)  so(3) invariant conformally-at metric on ads2  s2. the pa-
rameter qlp may now be interpreted as the s2 radius (which is also equal
to the radius of curvature of the ads2 factor). in horospherical coordinates
(t,  = /qlp ) for ads2, the 4-metric of the br solution of maxwell-einstein
theory is

ds2 = 2dt2 +

(qlp )2

2

d2 + (qlp )2d2 .

(8)

the metric is singular at  = 0, but this is just a coordinate singularity and
 = 0 is actually a non-singular degenerate killing horizon of the timelike
killing vector eld /t. to see this one may dene an ads2 space as a
surface in a at space with one more time variable and the so(1, 2) metric

x m mnx n + a2 = (x 0)2  x +x  + a2 = 0 .

(9)

one may introduce the hypersurface coordinates (, t) by choosing

x 0 = t ,

x  = a  ,

x + =

a2  t2

a 

.

(10)

the metric induced on the surface is the br metric (8) where the radius of
the ads space a is related to the black hole mass and charge as follows:

a = |qbh |lp = mbh l2

p .

(11)

the horospherical coordinates do not cover all of ads2 but only a half of
it, they cover ads2
j where j is the antipodal map. at  = 0 the metric (8)
has a singularity related to the black hole horizon and one has to choose
either  > 0 or  < 0. the coordinate x  = a  can be positive as well as
negative, but if  is restricted to be positive, this also means that x  has to
be positive, i.e. take half of the values which it is allowed when considered
as dening a surface (9).

4

the coordinates x 0, x +, x  evaluated on the hypersurface are smooth,
therefore  remains a good coordinate at the horizon  = 0, while the time
coordinate t becomes ill dened. this means that the original black hole
metric near the horizon has to be described using dierent coordinates. let
us rst introduce a complex variable t which is a complex combination of
two time-like coordinates,

t = t1 + it2 ,

t1 

x + + x 

2

,

t2  x 0 .

(12)

a space-like coordinate is

r 

x +  x 

2

.

(13)

in terms of coordinates (15) the surface is

 (t1)2  (t2)2 + r2 + a2 = t t  + r2 + a2 = 0 .

(14)

one may use a dierent solution to the surface constraint,

t = e

in these coordinates the metric is

i

a (cid:16)a2 + r2(cid:17)1/2

ds2 =   a2 + r2

a2 ! d 2 +  a2

a2 + r2! dr2 + a2d2 .

(15)

(16)

4. the so(1, 2) symmetry is linearly realized on the coordinates of the
nx n. no translations are allowed,
surface x m mnx n + a2 = 0 as x m =  m
only rotations. the generators of this symmetry j mn = ix [ m n] form the
so(1, 2) algebra:

[j mn, jpq] = i( m[pjq]n  n[pjq] m) .

(17)

the so(1, 2) symmetry consists of a compact rotation between two time-
like coordinates, t1 and t2 and of the two boosts between the space-like
coordinates r and two times. the rotation between two times can be easily
exponentiated by considering it as a u(1) transformation

t  = eit

5

(18)

this transformation is generated by the shift of the global time   =  + a
so that

i

t  = e

two boosts



a (cid:16)a2 + r2(cid:17)1/2

= t  = eit .

t = r

r =

2

(t  + t )

(19)

(20)

generate a u(1) transformation. the time translation generator is l0 and
the complex boost is generated by l.

in terms of so(1, 2) transformations (17) the generators of the quantum

mechanics with the well dened ground state are given by

jt1t2 = l0

jt1r  ijt2r = l

(21)

thus we described an interpretation of the quantum mechanical operators
l0, l starting with black holes and changing coordinates near the horizon
to avoid a singularity.

the new hamiltonian l0 of the conformal quantum mechanics does gener-
ate translation of the time  in the coordinate system describing the extreme
black hole near the horizon, where the time t of the horospherical coordinate
system is ill dened. somehow the conformal quantum mechanics found the
way to a correct description of the physics by breaking t-time translation
symmetry which is now understood in the context of the black hole horizon.
the black hole interpretation suggested in [1] of the unusual features of
a quantum mechanical system is clear. one may want to use this correspon-
dence in the opposite direction, to resolve the problems of black holes of the
classical general relativity by some kind of generalized quantum mechanics
which may have somewhat unusual features as in the example of the confor-
mal dff model, described above. a quantum mechanics of such nature may
tell us about the black hole interior.

i had clarifying discussions of the issues of black holes and quantum me-
chanics with g. gibbons, a. strominger, l. susskind and p. townsend. i am
grateful to the organizers of the conference novelties in string theories in
gothenburg for the stimulating environment. this work is supported by the
nsf grant phy-9870115.
