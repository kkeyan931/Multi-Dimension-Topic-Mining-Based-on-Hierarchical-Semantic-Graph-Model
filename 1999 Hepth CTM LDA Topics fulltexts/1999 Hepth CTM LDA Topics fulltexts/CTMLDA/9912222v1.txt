abstract

we construct the worldline supereld massive superparticle actions which preserve 1/4
portion of the underlying higher-dimensional supersymmetry. the rest of supersymmetry
is spontaneously broken and realized by nonlinear transformations. we consider the cases
of n = 4  n = 1 and n = 8  n = 2 partial breaking. in the rst case we present the
corresponding green-schwarz type target superspace action with one -supersymmetry. it
is related to the supereld action via a eld redenition. in the second case we nd out two
possible models, one of which is a direct generalization of the n = 4  n = 1 case, while
another is essentially dierent. for the rst model we formulate green-schwarz type action
with two -supersymmetries. we elaborate on the bosonic part of the supereld action for
the second model and nd that only in two special limits it takes the standard nambu-
goto form.
in the general case it is determined by a fourth-order algebraic equation.
the characteristic common feature of these new superparticle models is that the algebras
of their spontaneously broken supersymmetries are non-trivial truncations of the general
extensions of n = 1 and n = 2 poincare d = 4 superalgebras by tensorial central charges.

1 introduction

the most attractive feature of the description of superbranes based upon the concept of par-
tial spontaneous breaking of global supersymmetry (pbgs) [1] - [14] is the manifest o-shell
realization of the corresponding worldvolume supersymmetry. in this approach, the physical
worldvolume multiplets of the given superbrane are represented by superelds given on the
proper worldvolume superspace. they are interpreted as goldstone superelds realizing spon-
taneous breaking of the full brane supersymmetry group down to its unbroken worldvolume
subgroup. the spontaneously broken supersymmetry is realized on the goldstone superelds
by inhomogeneous and nonlinear transformations. the invariant goldstone superelds actions,
after passing to components and, in general, eliminating auxiliary elds by their equations of
motion, coincide with gauge-xed forms of the relevant green-schwarz type actions.

until now, only the examples of 1/2 breaking of supersymmetry corresponding to the stan-
dard bps p-branes and d-branes were treated in the literature on the pbgs. on the other
hand, recently there was some interest in the 1/4 and other unusual fractional pbgs options,
mainly caused by the existence of the d = 11 supergravity solutions which preserve various
fractions of the underlying 32 supersymmetries and admit a nice interpretation in terms of
intersecting branes (see, e.g., [15]-[20] and references therein).

in view of this, it seems interesting to extend the manifestly worldvolume supersymmetric
pbgs description of branes to the 1/4 breaking and other fractional patterns. in the present
paper, as rst steps toward this goal, we consider several examples of the 1/4 pbgs supereld
actions in the simplest case of massive superparticle.

the construction of the goldstone supereld action is the most dicult part of the pbgs
approach. the generic methods of nonlinear realizations [21]-[23] which nicely work in the
case of standard internal symmetry and space-time groups prove to be not too helpful when
trying to employ them for constructing pbgs invariants. all the known goldstone supereld
lagrangians are of the chern-simons or wznw type, in the sense that they are not tensors with
respect to the hidden supersymmetry transformations. the latter shift them by a full derivative,
thus leaving the action invariant up to surface terms. as the result, one cannot directly apply
the powerful method of covariant cartan forms for constructing invariant actions.

a way around this diculty was proposed in [8, 9] and used to construct the n = 1, d = 4
supereld actions providing the pbgs description of n = 2 d3-superbrane and super 3-brane.
it is based on the idea of embedding the basic goldstone supereld into some linear multiplet
of the underlying supersymmetry group. initially this multiplet comprises a set of independent
worldvolume superelds. after imposing appropriate covariant constraints one succeeds in
expressing all these superelds in terms of the basic goldstone ones. one of the superelds of
the initial linear representation is shifted by a full derivative under the broken supersymmetry
transformations and so can be chosen as the goldstone superelds lagrangian.

this procedure was further elaborated and applied to other cases of pbgs in refs. [11], [12],
[14]. however, its generality and usefulness are obscured by the fact that choosing the linear
representation to start with and picking up appropriate constraints are a sort of guess-work.
this guess-work becomes rather intricate in more complicated cases like the 1/4 pbgs patterns
we are interested in here.

in order to construct the goldstone supereld actions for this case we propose a more

1

systematic version of the above procedure, following the general method of setting up linear
representations of supersymmetry in terms of the appropriate nonlinear realizations [24, 25].
though this method was worked out originally for the case of total breaking of supersymmetry,
it can be straightforwardly extended to the pbgs case. its main advantage consists in that
it allows one to avoid seeking for the constraints on the original linearly transforming super-
elds. they are expressed through the goldstone superelds by making use of some algorithmic
algebraic computation.

in sect. 2 we explain this method on the toy examples of the n = 2  n = 1 and
n = 4  n = 2 pbgs in d = 1 which were studied earlier from a dierent point of view in
[3, 4, 6, 5]. then in sect. 3 we apply it to construct a new model of massive superparticle
with the 1/4 pbgs pattern n = 4  n = 1. we nd that the corresponding n = 4, d = 1
superalgebra does not follow by a dimensional reduction from the standard n = 1 poincare
superalgebra in d = 4. it is an extension of the latter by the lorentz tensorial central charges
(see [21, 27, 20, 19] and references therein) which yields this n = 4, d = 1 superalgebra
via dimensional reduction. in sect. 4 we give the corresponding green-schwarz type action
revealing just one local -symmetry and establish the precise correspondence between the pbgs
and green-schwarz actions. in sect. 5 we construct, using analogous methods, the superparticle
model realizing the pbgs n = 8  n = 2. we nd that there exist two versions of such
model. they dier in the supereld contents and in the structure of the physical bosons action.
only in the rst case this action has the standard static gauge nambu-goto form of the massive
particle action. we present the green-schwarz type action for this case, with two independent
 symmetries.

2 two examples of 1/2 pbgs in d=1

2.1 n=2  n=1
to explain the key features of our approach we start from a simplest example of n = 2  n = 1
partial breaking of global supersymmetry in d = 1.

the anticommutation relation of n = 1, d = 1 poincare superalgebra reads

{q, q} = 2p .

(2.1)

we wish to construct a n = 1 supereld action which is also invariant with respect to one
extra spontaneously broken d = 1 supersymmetry. thus our basic objects will be superelds
given on n = 1, d = 1 superspace with the coordinates {t, } , (t = t,  = ) 1

let us dene the fermionic and bosonic superelds (t, ) and v(t, ) related as

1
2dv ,
where d is the spinor covariant derivative

 =

(  = , v = v) ,

d =




+ t ,

{d,d} = 2t .

(2.2)

(2.3)

1henceforth, we use the following convention for the evolution parameter and action: t = it and s = is,

where t and s are the standard real time and action.

2

if we now introduce an additional, arbitrary for the moment, real spinor supereld (t, ) then
it becomes possible to realize an extra n = 1, d = 1 supersymmetry on the spinors  and .
assuming the second supersymmetry to be spontaneously broken, the linear transformation
laws can be written as

 =  (1  d) ,

 = d .

(2.4)

the presence of the constant shift in the transformations (2.4) just means the spontaneous
breaking of this supersymmetry and suggests the interpretation of  as the goldstone fermionic
supereld accompanying the linear realization of this breaking. one can check that the gener-
ator s of the transformations (2.4) forms the n = 1, d = 1 superalgebra

{s, s} = 2p

(2.5)

and anticommutes with the generator q of the manifest n = 1 supersymmetry (2.1) in the
given realization.2 however, from (2.4) one can also extract the transformation law of the scalar
supereld v:

v = 2 (  ) ,

 =

1
2

tv .

(2.6)

now, the brackets of the manifest and second n = 1 supersymmetries yield a constant shift
of the supereld v, which means that a central charge z appears in the anticommutators of
these two n = 1 supersymmetries and v is the bosonic goldstone supereld associated with
the broken central charge transformations

{q, s} = 2z .

(2.7)

thus, as long as we limit our attention to the goldstone fermionic supereld only, the
full supersymmetry algebra is given by (2.1), (2.5) with no need for central charge. imposing
the relation (2.2) introduces the active central charge as in (2.7) with v as the corresponding
goldstone supereld. as we shall see soon, these options lead to pbgs theories with dierent
physical elds contents.

let us note that the eld  is a good candidate for the lagrangian density. indeed, the

integral

is manifestly invariant with respect to the rst n = 1 supersymmetry. it is also invariant with
respect to the second supersymmetry because the integrand is shifted by a spinor derivative
under the variation (2.4).

2we should stress that hereafter the superalgebras we deal with are those of the supereld variations. it
is sucient to consider them for our aim of constructing invariant actions. the superalgebras of charges and
supercharges constructed from the pbgs actions by nother procedure are dierent: they inevitably include
some constant central charges which are crucial for evading [1, 2] the famous wittens no-go theorem [28]. in
particular, such a central charge will appear as a shift of p in the r.h.s. of the anticommutator (2.5) of generators
of the spontaneously broken s supersymmetry. these central charges do not produce any transformation on
the elds, as opposed to another, active sort of central charges which generate actual symmetries and are of
heavy use throughout this paper.

i =z dtd 

(2.8)

if the supereld  is regarded as independent, the action (2.8) is of course meaningless.
it becomes meaningful after expressing  in terms of the goldstone supereld . this can be
performed in a covariant way, resorting to the method of [24, 25].

as the rst step one nds the nite transformations of the second supersymmetry for the

basic superelds ,  which for the case at hand just coincide with (2.4).

next, one introduces the goldstone fermion of nonlinear realization  having the following

transformation law under the second supersymmetry:

 =  + t .

(2.9)

this object, together with n = 1 superspace coordinates, parametrize the supersymmetry
group manifold. the innitesimal transformation law (2.9) correspond to the standard group
composition law for the exponential parametrization of the supergroup element.

new superelds

the crucial step is to substitute () for the parameter  in the r.h.s. of (2.4) and to dene
(2.10)
one can check that the newly dened superelds ,  transform homogeneously and indepen-
dently of each other under the second spontaneously broken supersymmetry [24]:

 =    (1  d) ,

 =   d .

thus it is the covariant operation to put these superelds equal to zero3

  = t

 ,

  = t  .

 = 0 ,

 = 0 .

these constraints imply the following set of equations for the original superelds , , 

   (1  d) = 0 ,

  d = 0 ,

(2.11)

(2.12)

(2.13)

providing the manifestly covariant way of expressing them in terms of a few basic ones. as
such one can take either the goldstone fermion of the nonlinear realization, or that of the linear
realization. the solution to eqs. (2.13) is given by

1 + 1  4d d

=

1 + dd

,

(2.14)

(2.15)

we see that eq.
(2.14) gives the expression of  through the goldstone superelds, while
eq. (2.15) is just the equivalency relation between the two types of the goldstone fermionic
superelds.

we should stress that the transformation properties of the goldstone fermion  (2.9) actually
follow from their expressions (2.15) and the known transformation properties of ,  (2.4).
therefore we do not need to know them beforehand.

3in principle, one could choose an arbitrary constant as the r.h.s. of the second constraint. this does not

inuence our further consideration.

finally, after the substitution of the expression (2.14) and using (2.2) the integral (2.8)

yields the sought goldstone supereld action

sv =z dtd

(2.16)

for the physical bosonic component v|=0 one obtains just the d = 2 massive particle action
in the static gauge:

sbos

v =

1

2z dt(cid:18)1 q1  (tv)2(cid:19) .

(2.17)

thus, the action (2.16) can be naturally interpreted as a manifestly n = 1, d = 1 supersym-
metric worldline action of the superparticle in d = 2.

note that the action (2.16) is related by a simple eld redenition to the d = 2 superpar-
ticle action which was constructed in [4] proceeding from the standard nonlinear realizations
approach. it was also obtained in [5] as the low-energy collective coordinates action in some
two-dimensional solitonic models. we used this system just as a simple illustration of our
approach to the construction of the pbgs goldstone superelds actions.

finally, we would like to mention that there exists one more possibility for the goldstone
supereld action. namely, one can consider  as an independent supereld, without assuming
the prepotential representation (2.2). this choice corresponds to the n = 2 supersymmetry
algebra with z = 0 in (2.7). in this case the o-shell wordline goldstone multiplet consists of
the physical fermion |=0 and an auxiliary bosonic eld d|=0 , i.e. it includes no physical
boson at all. such an exotic structure is of course an artifact of the one-dimensional case where
supersymmetry in general does not require matching of the on-shell fermionic and bosonic
degrees of freedom. the corresponding goldstone action is still given by (2.16), with  standing
for 1
2dv. the auxiliary eld d vanishes by its equations of motion like in the free case (with
d as the lagrangian), and the action of the physical fermion turns out to be just the
n = 1, d = 1 volkov-akulov action [29]. it corresponds to the total breaking of n = 1, d = 1 s
supersymmetry. any trace of unbroken q supersymmetry (2.18) disappears on shell. moreover,
this d = 1 volkov-akulov action coincides with the free one.

2.2 n=4  n=2

for completeness we briey consider one more simple example of pbgs in d = 1, namely the
n = 4  n = 2 one.

the n = 2, d = 1 poncare superalgebra without central charges reads

{q, q} =n q, qo = 0 ,

nq, qo = p .

(2.18)

our basic objects will be the fermionic and bosonic n = 2, d = 1 superelds (t, , ), (t, , )

and (t, , ) where nt, , o are n = 2, d = 1 superspace coordinates. we assume that  is a

real supereld while ,  are related to it by

 =

d ,

 =

2

d ,

(2.19)

where the spinor covariant derivatives are dened by

d =

2

t ,

d =


 

+

1
2

t ,

nd, do = t , d2 = d2 = 0 .

by construction, the fermionic superelds are chiral (antichiral)

d = 0 ,

d  = 0 .

(2.20)

(2.21)

after introducing an additional scalar supereld (t, , ) one can realize an extra n =
2, d = 1 supersymmetry on the spinors ,  and scalar  (the second supersymmetry with the
generators s, s is supposed to be spontaneously broken):

the transformation law of the scalar supereld  reads:

 = (cid:16)1  dd(cid:17) ,

  = (cid:16)1 + d d(cid:17) ,
 = 2(cid:16)   + d + d(cid:17) .

 =     .

(2.22)

(2.23)

(2.24)

(2.25)

once again, due to the explicit presence of ,  in (2.23), the brackets of the manifest and second
n = 2 supersymmetries yield a constant shift of the supereld , and therefore a central charge
z appears in the anticommutators of these two n = 2 supersymmetries 4

ns, so = p ,

n q, so = 2z .

the eld  can be treated as the lagrangian density and the action

nq, so = 2z ,
s =z dtd2 

is manifestly invariant with respect to both n = 2 supersymmetries. to express  in terms of
the goldstone superelds ,  we use the same method [24, 25] as in the previous subsection.
the nite transformations of the second supersymmetry for the basic superelds , , 

can be easily computed

like in the previous example they transform independently of each another and homogeneously
under the spontaneously broken supersymmetry.

as the last step one puts these superelds equal to zero

the solution to eqs. (2.29) is given by

which are equivalent to the ordinary chirality conditions (2.21) for , .

after the substitution of the expression (2.30) and using (2.19) the action (2.25) takes the

form

s =z dtd2

(2.29)

(2.30)

(2.31)

(2.32)

(2.33)

(2.34)

for the physical bosonic component |=0 one obtains just the d = 2 massive particle action
in the static gauge5:

sbos

 =

1

2z dt(cid:18)1 q1 + (t)2(cid:19) .

thus, the action (2.33) can be naturally interpreted as a manifestly n = 2, d = 1 supersym-
metric worldline action of the superparticle in d = 2. note that the auxiliary eld in  is
vanishing on shell.

like in other pbgs theories, in our case the goldstone fermions can be placed into dierent
multiplets of unbroken n = 2, d = 1 supersymmetry. instead of the real scalar supereld we
can choose chiral-anti-chiral bosonic superelds ,  as the basic goldstone ones:

  = 2(cid:16) + d(cid:17) ,

 =

1

2(cid:16)d  +  d(cid:17) .

(2.36)

from (2.36) one nds that the brackets of manifest and spontaneously broken supersymmetry
contain a complex central charge z:

nq, so = 2z ,

n q, so = 2 z ,

which is realized as shifts of , .

substituting the expressions for ,  (2.35) into (2.30), one nds the action

(2.37)

(2.38)

(2.39)

its bosonic core is the d = 3 particle action in the static gauge:

where  = |=0,  = |=0. therefore, (2.38) is a manifestly n = 2, d = 1 supersymmetric
worldline action of the massive n = 2 superparticle in d = 3 6.
note that this action was deduced earlier in [6] using a dierent approach. it was demon-
strated there that the corresponding component action is related through a eld redenition to
a gauge-xed form of the relevant green-schwarz type action (in the static gauge and with 
symmetry fully used to gauge away two out of four target spinor coordinates).

in the considered case, like in the previous one, there exists one more possibility for the
goldstone supereld action, with ,  being basic chiral superelds unrelated to any additional
bosonic ones. in this case we once again end up with a d = 1 volkov-akulov action for the
complex goldstone fermionic eld, such that it is reduced to the free action via the suitable
eld redenition.

3 n=4  n=1 pbgs

the conventional way of dealing with the pbgs phenomenon is to start from some super-
symmetry algebra, to construct its appropriate nonlinear realization and then to look for the
invariant action. as was already mentioned in introduction, the nonlinear realization formal-
ism is not too helpful in what concerns the last problem. also, there are no clear principles as
to which version of the given poincare supersymmetry should be actually chosen as the point
of departure: with or without central charges, how many such charges should be taken into
account, etc. for instance, an attempt to describe 1/4 breaking of n = 1 poincare super-
symmetry in d = 11 along the standard lines [13] leads to very strong constraints on some

6to avoid a possible confusion, recall that n = 2, d = 3 poincare supersymmetry has 4 fermionic generators

and it is just n = 4 superalgebra with two central charges from the d = 1 perspective.

of the involved goldstone superelds. similar diculties come out when trying to apply the
standard formalism for describing the 1/4 pbgs pattern n = 2, d = 4  n = 1, d = 3 [32].
in this and next sections we adhere to a somewhat dierent point of view already accounted
for in the previous section. namely, we start with some probe linear representation of the
spontaneously broken supersymmetry realized on a set of world-line superelds involving the
needed number of goldstone fermions. then we restore the full structure of the supersymme-
try algebra by studying the closure of supersymmetry transformations. after this we express
the linearly transforming superelds in terms of the goldstone ones, applying the procedure
explained in the previous section (or its modications). finally, we construct the invariant o-
shell goldstone supereld action like in the previous cases as a world-line superspace integral
of the appropriate d = 1 supereld component of the original linear representation.

we rstly apply this general strategy to the case of n = 4  n = 1 pbgs. our goal is
to construct a n = 1, d = 1 supereld action which would respect three extra spontaneously
broken supersymmetries. thus, the minimal multiplet should include at least three n = 1
fermionic goldstone superelds i(t, )(i = 1, 2, 3). without loss of generality these superelds
can be chosen to form a triplet with respect to some so(3) automorphism group. as their basic
property, they should have inhomogeneous transformation laws with respect to the broken
supersymmetries, i.e. their transformations should start with the corresponding grassmann
parameters. one can check that this requirement is met in a minimal way and the algebra of
transformations gets closed at cost of adding one additional fermionic n = 1 supereld (t, ).
the transformations under the broken supersymmetries read

i = i (1  d)  ijkjdk ,

 = idi .

(3.1)

(3.2)

they form the following algebra

{q, q} = 2p ,

nsi, sjo = 2ijp ,

nq, sio = 0 .

the fermionic n = 1, d = 1 superelds contain no bosonic degrees of freedom of physical
dimension. since we wish to have a superparticle model, with the world-line scalar n = 1
multiplets containing such bosonic elds, we are led to introduce bosonic superelds vi

i =

1
2dvi ,

(cid:16) i = i , vi = vi(cid:17) .

their transformation properties can be extracted from (3.1) :

vi = 2i (  ) + ijkjdvk ,

 =

1
2

itvi .

(3.3)

(3.4)

like in the n = 4  n = 2 case, due to the explicit presence of  in the transformations (3.4),
the anticommutators of the manifest q and spontaneously broken si supersymmetry generators
acquire an active central charges z i in the right-hand side. finally, the basic anticommutation
relations extracted from the above supereld variations read

{q, q} = 2p ,

nsi, sjo = 2ijp ,

nq, sio = 2z i .

(3.5)

the central charge generators act as pure shifts of vi, suggesting the interpretation of vi as
goldstone superelds parametrizing transverse directions in a four-dimensional space where
z i, p act as the translation operators.

surprisingly, the superalgebra (3.5) cannot be interpreted as a dimensional reduction of
the standard n = 1 poincare superalgebra in d = 4, with z i, p being the components of full
4- momentum. moreover, it also cannot be recovered from any one - or two-central charges
extension of the d = 3 or d = 2 poincare superalgebras with the relevant lorentz groups
(so(1, 2)  sl(2, r) and so(1, 1)) as the automorphism ones. indeed, the only automorphism
group of (3.5) is so(3) with respect to which both odd and even generators are split into a
singlet and triplet.

nevertheless, it is still possible to interpret (3.5) in the dimensional reduction language. for
this one should proceed not from the standard n = 1, d = 4 super poincare algebra, but from
its extension by tensorial central charges [21, 27, 19]. the generators z i turn out to partly
come from these central charges and partly from the extra components of 4-momentum. the
precise correspondence is given in appendix.

let us turn to the issue of constructing invariant action for the system under consideration.

like in the previous case (sect. 2), we can use (v) as a lagrangian density,

(3.6)

in view of its transformation property (3.1). then the main question is how to covariantly
express  in terms of i and, further, vi. one could use just the method of the previous section.
however, it turns out that in the present case it is easier to perform a direct construction of .
the idea of this construction is rather simple. in the case at hand there is only one non-
nilpotent bosonic dimensionless object x = didi. therefore the general ansatz for the
supereld  will contain arbitrary functions of x only. moreover, the unique objects having
positive (one half) dimension (in the length units) are the spinor superelds i. this allows
one to write the general ansatz for  as
 = idia + 2ii

tdjc + ii

tjdje

tb + 2idij
t dig ,

tdif + 32i

+3di

(3.7)

where a, b, . . . , g are as yet undetermined functions of x, and we use the following notations

i
t = ti ,

2i = ijkjk ,

3 = ijkijk .

(3.8)

now, using (3.1), (3.7) we can write i in terms of i only. then we can explicitly evaluate 
and then require it to be equal to idi in accordance with the transformation law (3.1). after
rather lengthy calculations we get the system of algebraic equations for the functions a, . . . , g

(1  xa) a = 1  a =

, f =

a3(a  4)
6(a  2)2 , g = 

a5(a  4)
6(a  2)2 .(3.9)

thus the integral (3.6) with  dened by (3.7), (3.9) provides us with the action for the system
realizing the n = 4  n = 1 pbgs pattern.

10

in fact we can greatly simplify this action. first, let us note that the b and c terms in
(3.7) can be absorbed (up to full t- and d- derivatives) into the f term. as the second step,
all the remaining e, f , g terms can be reduced to the single a term, redening the superelds
vi as follows

vi  i = vi + 3ijkj

(3.10)

tdkh1 + 3i

th2 + ijk2jdkh3 ,

where h1, h2, h3 are some functions of x. these functions can be given explicitly, but to
know the precise expressions is in fact needless for our purpose. the main point is that the
action in terms of the redened bosonic supereld i takes the very simple form

s =z dtd

2idi

1 + 1  4djdj

,

i

2di .

(3.11)

of course, the transformation properties of the new superelds i, i essentially dier from
(3.1), (3.4), but the action is guaranteed to be invariant by the above construction.

thus we have found the correct goldstone superelds action describing the pbgs pattern

n = 4  n = 1.

let us end this section by noting that the bosonic core of the action (3.11)

sbos

 =

1

2z dt(cid:18)1 q1  titi(cid:19)

(3.12)

is just the standard massive d = 4 particle action in the static gauge. it is known to exhibit
the hidden nonlinearly realized d = 4 lorentz symmetry so(1, 3). one can ask why this
symmetry is present in this action whereas the supersymmetry algebra (3.5) from which we
have started respects no such an automorphism. the answer is that the explicit breaking
of this lorentz symmetry occurs just in the fermionic terms of the component action. this
becomes transparent in the green-schwarz formulation of the same system. now we turn to
describing such a formulation.

4 target space action with one -supersymmetry

to clarify the situation with n = 4  n = 1 pbgs, in this section we construct the target
space action which possesses only one -supersymmetry and reduces to the action (3.11) in a
xed gauge.

we shall deal with the n = 4 superalgebra (3.5). in accordance with the standard strat-
egy of constructing green-schwarz type actions (see [30, 3, 4, 31, 6] for the case of massive
superparticles) let us introduce bosonic x 0(t), y i(t) and fermionic (t), i(t) d = 1 elds, the
coordinates of a target n = 4 superspace. they have the standard transformation properties
under n = 4 supersymmetry (3.5)

y i = i  i ,
next we construct the supersymmetric invariants 0, i

x 0 =   ii ,

 =  ,

i = i .

(4.1)

0 = tx 0 + t + iti ,

i = ty i  ti + ti .

(4.2)

11

after some guess-work, the target sigma-model action invariant under the global target
space supersymmetry (4.1), local t reparametrizations and one local fermionic  symmetry was
found to have the following almost unique form

sgs = z dt00  ii  z dt(cid:16)t  iti(cid:17) ,

(4.3)

where  = 1. the latter ambiguity in the sign amounts to the fact that the rst and second
terms in the lagrangian density in (4.3) behave in dierent way under the reection t  t:
rst one is invariant while the second changes its sign. the cases with  = 1 are related by
this reection, so without loss of generality one can choose, e.g.,  = 1.

the -symmetry transformations are given by

i = 
 =  ,
x 0 =   ii,

0  00  ii

y i = i  i ,

i

(4.4)

where (t) is an arbitrary fermionic gauge parameter. it is straightforward to check the invari-
ance of (4.3) under these transformations.

we claim that the action (4.3) possesses only one -supersymmetry and therefore provides
another, space-time realization of the same n = 4  n = 1 pbgs phenomenon. let us
prove that (4.3) indeed possesses no any other local fermionic symmetry apart from -symmetry
(4.4).

to this end, we need to study the algebra of the constraints in the hamiltonian formalism.

we rst introduce the einbein e(t) and rewrite the action (4.3) (with  = 1) as

sgs =z dtl = z dt(cid:20) 1

2e(cid:16)00  ii(cid:17) +

e

2(cid:21) z dt(cid:16)t  iti(cid:17) .

(4.6)

the canonical hamiltonian reads

h = p 0tx 0 + p ity i + t + tii  l =

2

(p 0p 0  p ip i  1) .

(4.7)

there is one primary bosonic constraint, pe, and four fermionic constraints which we denote
by

 0 =  + (p 0  1) + p ii ,

 i = i + (p 0 + 1)i + p i .

(4.8)

when taking the poisson bracket of the primary bosonic constraint with the canonical hamil-
tonian, we obtain the secondary bosonic constraint

p 0p 0  p ip i = 1

12

(4.9)

we now have to determine which of the fermionic constraints   = ( 0,  i) are rst class, and
thus generate gauge symmetries, and which are second class. we compute the matrix of the
poisson brackets of the fermionic constraints

{ ,  } = c  ,

c = 2  p 0  1

~p

~p t

(p 0 + 1)1 ! ,

(4.10)

where 1 is the three dimensional unit matrix. the eigenvalues of the matrix c are easily

computed to be p 0 + 1, p 0 + 1, p 0 +q ~p 2 + 1, p 0 q ~p 2 + 1, on the constraint surface, the

last of these eigenvalues vanishes, and the other three remain non zero. thus, there is one and
only one rst class constraint which may be chosen to be

 =  0 
its poisson brackets with the constraints read

1

p 0 + 1

~p ~ .

{,  0} =

2(p 0p 0  p ip i  1)

p 0 + 1

,

{,  i} = 0 .

(4.11)

(4.12)

the constraint  generates the unique local fermionic symmetry (4.4) through the poisson
bracket.

it is natural to expect, by analogy with the 1/2 pbgs examples [3, 4], that the static gauge
(x 0 = t,  = 0) form of (4.3) coincides, modulo eld redenitions, with the component action
following from the world-line supereld one (3.11). now we shall show that this is indeed the
case.

in the static gauge the action (4.3) (with  = 1) reads

sgs = z dt(cid:20)q(1 + iti)2  ty ity i  iti(cid:21) .

one can reduce it to the form

sgs = z dt(cid:20)q1  ty ity i  eitei(cid:21) ,

where

ei = a1ih1 + a2(t) + a3(t)2i ,

ty ity i

(4.13)

(4.14)

.

(4.15)

on the other hand, the action (3.11) after integration over  and properly rescaling fermions
can be rewritten as follows:

s =z dt"

1 + 1  tjtj  iti 

ititjtj

(1 + 1  tjtj)1  tjtj# .

(4.16)

13

by passing to the new variables i,ei

the action (4.16) can be put in the form

i = ei(cid:16)1 + atjejt(tktek)(cid:17)

(4.17)

(4.18)

(4.19)

(4.20)

to an overall constant.

it can be easily seen that after rescaling of ei by 1/2 the action (4.18) reduces to (4.14) up

finally, we note that in terms of the invariants (4.2) the green-schwarz action (4.3) looks
as if it possess d = 4 lorentz invariance. indeed, in the limit of vanishing fermions x 0, y i
and, hence, 0, i can be combined into a d = 4 vector. however, the fermionic terms in (4.2)
break this would-be lorentz symmetry down to so(3).

5 n=8  n=2 pbgs
in this section we will consider two examples of n = 8  n = 2 pbgs.
in the previous sections we described the procedure which helps to dene the action for
the given pbgs pattern if the proper realization of broken supersymmetries is known. to
construct a superparticle model which would exhibit n = 8  n = 2 pbgs we should,
before all, examine how 6 broken supersymmetries could be realized on a set of n = 2, d = 1
superelds. we succeeded in nding out two such realizations.

5.1 case i
the rst realization is a more or less straightforward generalization of the n = 4  n = 1
case. the basic set of n = 2, d = 1 superelds includes seven bosonic superelds: a general
real supereld  and two conjugated triplets of chiral-anti-chiral superelds vi, vi:

the broken supersymmetry transformations of these superelds read

dvi = dvi = 0 ,

i = 1, 2, 3 .

vi = 2(cid:16)  d(cid:17) i + ijkjdvk ,

 =

1

2(cid:16)idvi + i dvi(cid:17) .

14

vi = 2(cid:16) + d(cid:17) i + ijkj dvk,

(5.1)

together with the manifest supersymmetry, they form the algebra with six central charges
z i, z i

nq, sio = 2z i ,

n q, sio = 2 z i .

(5.2)

nq, qo = p ,

nsi, sjo = ijp ,

the fermionic chiral superelds dened by

i = 

1
2

dvi ,

i =

1
2

dvi

are transformed under (5.1) as

i =(cid:16)1  dd(cid:17) i + ijkj d k,  i =(cid:16)1 + d d(cid:17) i + ijkjdk,  = i i  ii. (5.3)

so they are goldstone superelds corresponding to the linear realization of six spontaneously
broken supersymmetries with the parameters i, i. the bosonic superelds vi, vi are the gold-
stone ones associated with the spontaneously broken central charges transformations.

an interesting feature of this realization is the strange charges of the goldstone superelds
with respect to the u(1) automorphism group of the manifest supersymmetry algebra. indeed,
from (5.3) one nds the relation between the charges of i and 

q =

1
3

q .

(5.4)

correspondingly, for the charge of vi we have

qv = 

2
3

q .

one should ascribe similar fractional charges, of course, to the spontaneously broken super-
symmetry and central charge generators in (5.2).

once again, the supereld , in accord with its transformation properties, can be chosen
as the lagrangian density describing this pbgs pattern. the straightforward application of
the method [24, 25] for expressing  in terms of the goldstone superelds i, i yields a rather
complicated system of equations. it can be rather easily solved in the limit of vanishing fermions,
yielding the static gauge action for a massive particle in a seven-dimensional space-time as the
bosonic part of the full supereld action

sbos

v =

1

2z dt(cid:18)1 q1 + tvitvi(cid:19) .

(5.5)

we have found the full action in terms of n = 2 superelds as well. it does not look very
illuminating, so we do not give it here.

surprisingly, the target space gs formulation for this case is very similar to the case of
n = 4  n = 1 pbgs. the full action for the physical worldline multiplet can be immediately
extracted from this formulation.
as a rst step, we dene the standard realization of n=8 superalgebra (5.2) in the superspace

with seven bosonic x 0, y i, y i and eight fermionic , , i, i coordinates:

 =  ,
x 0 = 

1

i = i ,

y i = 2i ,
2(cid:16)  +  + i i + ii(cid:17) .

15

  =  ,

 i = i ,

 y i = 2i  ,

(5.6)

using the supersymmetric invariants

0 = tx 0 +

i = ty i + 2it ,

1

2(cid:16)t  + t + it i + iti(cid:17) ,
i  (i) = t y i + 2 it  .

we can construct the unique action

sgs = z dtq00  i i +z dt(cid:16) t  it i(cid:17) ,

with two -supersymmetries:

1

x 0 = 
i =

2(cid:16)  +   + ii + i i(cid:17) , y i = 2i ,  y i = 2 i  ,
0 + 00  i i

0 + 00  i i

,  i =

i 

i

.

(5.7)

(5.8)

(5.9)

the hamiltonian analysis, which repeats the basic steps of the analysis in the n = 4  n = 1
case, shows that there are no further gauge fermionic symmetries in the action (5.8).

in the static gauge, x 0 = t,  = 0, the action (5.8) takes the very simple form

sgs = z dts(cid:18)1 +

1
2

it i +

1
2

ti i(cid:19)2

+ ty it y i + it i .

(5.10)

we are still not aware of the equivalency transformation from this action to the pbgs action.
we expect such a transformation to exist like in the other known pbgs cases, though its precise
form can be rather complicated in view of complexity of the full pbgs action.

5.2 case ii

the second realization of n = 8, d = 1 supersymmetry with six spontaneously broken super-
symmetries can be constructed in terms of general bosonic n = 2 supereld  and six chiral

and anti-chiral goldstone fermions n, , , o ,  = 1, 2

d = d = 0 ,

d  = d  = 0 ,

(5.11)

which form two doublets and two singlets with respect to so(2) automorphism group. the
appropriate closed set of the broken supersymmetry transformations reads

 =(cid:16)1 + dd(cid:17)  +   d  ,
 = (cid:16) d  +  d (cid:17) +(cid:16)1  dd(cid:17)  ,
  =  (d + d) +(cid:16)1 + d d(cid:17)  ,
 =       +   .

  =(cid:16)1  d d(cid:17)  + d ,

(5.12)

16

to reveal the underlying central-charges extended supersymmetry algebra and to gain phys-
ical bosonic elds, we need to pass as before to bosonic superelds. the minimal realization
amounts to expressing  through two real scalar superelds u:

 = 

1
2

du ,

 =

1
2

du .

(5.13)

to learn what kind of prepotential one should introduce for the remaining goldstone super-
eld , let us examine the relation between u(1) charges of spinor superelds which follows
from (5.12)

q = 2q  qd .

(5.14)
here qd is the u(1) charge of the covariant derivative d (qd = 1 if one ascribes the charge
+1 to ). from this relation and (5.13) it follows that the u(1) charges of  and  are equal
to qd and qd, respectively. recall, however, that  and  have same chiralities (see (5.11)).
bearing this in mind, the only way to introduce the bosonic supereld v for  is to choose it
complex and having the u(1) charge equal to 2qd
dv ,

dv = dv = 0 .

(5.15)

dv ,

 = 

1
2

 =

2

in terms of the newly introduced bosonic superelds the supersymmetry transformations

take the form:

v = 2(cid:16) + d(cid:17)  +  du ,
u = (cid:16)du +  du + dv +  dv(cid:17) + 2(cid:16) + d(cid:17)   2(cid:16)  d(cid:17)  ,
 = 

v = 2(cid:16)  d(cid:17)  +  du ,

2(cid:16)dv +  dv   du  du(cid:17) .

1

(5.16)

denoting the generators of the broken supersymmetry by s, s and s, s, and the generators
of the manifest n = 2 supersymmetry by q, q, one can write the full supersymmetry algebra
pertinent to this case as

nq, qo =ns, so = p , ns, so = ,p , nq, so = 2 z , n q, so = 2z ,
nq, so = 2z , n q, so = 2z , ns, so = 2z , n s, so = 2z .

(5.17)

once again, we can take the supereld  as the lagrangian density and the main problem is
to covariantly express  in terms of the goldstone fermions or goldstone bosons. the method
we used in the previous cases works here as well, but it gives rather complicated equations
which we for the time being were unable to solve explicitly. nevertheless, we can try to nd
the bosonic part of the action. to this end, we should keep in the superelds with tilde (which
are obtained by the nite broken supersymmetry transformations of our basic superelds) only
a few terms, namely, the terms linear in the fermionic superelds and quadratic terms in :

2(cid:16)    +    (cid:17) = 0 ,

(5.19)

where x = dd.

now, substituting (, , , ) from (5.18) in (5.19), hitting both sides of (5.19) by dd
and omitting the terms with fermions we get the following equation for the bosonic part of the
action which we denote by x:

or, equivalently,

here,

(x 2  x + a)(x 2 + a  1) + 2d d  = 0 ,

(x 2  2x + 1 + a)(x 2 + x + a)  2 dd  = 0 .

a = d d  + dd  .

(5.20)

(5.21)

the general solution of these equations exists (we are interested in that one which goes to zero
when all elds are put equal to zero), but it looks too complicated to explicitly present it here.
in the two limits,  = 0 or  = 0, it takes the familiar form of the static gauge actions of
massive particles moving on some three-dimensional target manifolds

sbos

v =

1

2z dt(cid:18)1 q1 + tvtv(cid:19) ,

sbos

u =

1

2z dt(cid:18)1 q1 + tutu(cid:19) .

(5.22)

in the generic case there is a non-trivial cross-interaction between the bosonic elds appearing
in (5.22). it can hopefully be interpreted in the geometric language of intersection of the trajec-
tories of two dierent superparticles, with the physical worldline scalar multiplets represented
by the superelds u and v, v, respectively.

the fact that the bosonic part of the action cannot be written in the standard form strongly
obscures the construction of the gs formulation for this case. up to now we have not succeeded
to nd a manageable form even for the bosonic part of the hypothetical target superspace gs
action in the case at hand (though the wz term seems to be a direct generalization of those
for the previously studied cases). we believe that the better understanding of this case would
be helpful for studying the 1/4 pbgs systems with higher-dimensional worldvolumes. such
systems hopefully correspond to the new types of superbranes.

6 conclusions

in this paper we presented, for the rst time, the manifestly worldline supersymmetric super-
particle actions exhibiting hidden spontaneously broken supersymmetries the number of which
is four times the number of the linearly realized manifest ones. we treated in detail the case
of n = 4  n = 1 partial breaking and discussed some basic features of the more com-
plicated n = 8  n = 2 case. we proposed a general systematic method of constructing
actions for these and other pbgs systems. for the rst case and for one of the two versions
of the second case we found the appropriate gs-type target superspace actions with one and
two -symmetries. the common unusual feature of the superparticle systems considered is
that their space-time interpretation is possible only within the superspaces corresponding to

18

higher-dimensional supersymmetries with tensorial central charge generators. the target space
coordinates associated with some combinations of these generators and extra components of
the translation operator parametrize the transverse spatial bosonic directions in these models.
it would be of interest to understand whether this is the general property of systems with frac-
tional pbgs. another interesting problem is to see whether the 1/4 pbgs patterns studied
here can be related to the existence of the appropriate bps solutions of higher-dimensional
supergravities along the line of refs. [16, 17, 20].

appendix: n=4, d=1 from n=1, d=4

here we demonstrate how n = 4, d = 1 supersymmetry algebra (3.5) can be recovered from
the n = 1, d = 4 algebra extended by tensorial central charges.

this extended superalgebra is dened by the following anticommutation relations [27, 19, 20]

{q, q } = 2 () p = 2  p0 + 2 (m) pm ,
{q, q} = 2 t() ,

{ q , q } = 2 t (  )

(a.1)

(a.2)

let us deviate from this standard manifestly sl(2, c) covariant notation by keeping manifest
only su(2)  sl(2, c). in such a notation the dotted indices are simply upper case doublet
su(2) indices. e.g., the relation (a.1) is rewritten as

{q, q} = 2 

p0 + 2 (m)

pm .

next, we combine q and q into doublets of some extra su(2) and pass to the quartet notation

qi = (q, q),

qi = ikqk ,

(12 = 12 = 1) .

in terms of these generators the original algebra (a.1) is rewritten as

{qi, qk} = 2 f()(ik) + 2 ikp0 ,

where

f()(11) = t() , f()(22) = t () , f()(12) = (m)()pm .

(a.3)

(a.4)

(a.5)

note that this form of the algebra (a.1), (a.2) reveals that the full automorphism group of the
latter is the 16-parametric non-compact general linear group gl(4, r). it contains, in parallel

19

with the so(4)  su(2)  su(2) subgroup which is manifest in the notation (a.4), also the
original lorentz group, of course. the generators belonging to the coset of the latter over the
left manifest su(2) are constructed as direct products of the generators of this su(2) by i(3)k
i
and so act also on the index i of qi.

in order to reproduce the algebra (3.5), we need two more steps.
first, we should pass to the notation in which only the diagonal su(2) in the product
su(2)  su(2) realized on qi is manifest. then we split qi into a singlet and triplet with
respect to this diagonal su(2)

qi = iq + i(n)(i)sn ,

q = q , sn = (sn) .

(a.6)

similarly, the tensorial generator f()(ik) in (a.4) is split into a real totally symmetric 4-index
tensor f(ik) (5 independent components), a pseudo-real triplet

f(i) =

1
2 {kf()(ik) + (  i)}  2i(m)(i)z m ,

z m = z m ,

(a.7)

and a real singlet

f =

1
2

ikf()(ik) .

(a.8)

the algebra (a.4) in this new basis can be rewritten as follows

{q, q} = p0 + f ,

{q, sn} = 2 z n ,

{sm, sn} = 2 z (mn) + mn (p0 

1

f ) ,

(a.9)

where

z (mn) = 

1
4

(m)(i)(n)(k)f(ik) ,

tr z = 0 .

we observe that (a.9) coincide with (3.5) (up to the rescaling p = 1/2 p0) provided that

z (mn) = 0 ,

f = 0 .

(a.10)

these constraints are covariant under the manifest diagonal su(2)  so(3) which is thus
identied with the so(3) automorphisms of (3.5). eqs. (a.10) can be shown to fully break
the rest of the automorphism group gl(4, r) of the algebra (a.1), (a.4), which explains the
absence of any extra automorphisms in (3.5).

eqs. (a.10) amount to the following constraints on the original bosonic generators

t12 = p1  ip2 , t 12 = (p1 + ip2) , t 11 + t22 = 0 , t11 = t 22 = 0 , p3 = 0 , (a.11)
leaving us just with four independent generators (together with p ). taking account of these
relations, the central charges z i can be identied with the following combinations

z 1 = p2 ,

z 2 = p1 ,

z 3 =

i
4

(t 11  t22) .

(a.12)

note that the superalgebra of charges obtained via nothers prescription from the pbgs action
(3.11) diers from (3.5) by the presence of non-zero constant generator f . it ensures the relative

20

shift of the translation generators in the qq and ss anticommutators in accord with the general
reasoning of ref. [1, 2].

for the underlying algebras of other 1/4 pbgs examples considered in this paper one can
also obtain a similar identication proceeding from the most general extension of n = 2, d = 4
superalgebra by the appropriate tensorial central charges (such extensions for the generic n
are presented, e.g., in [27, 20]).
