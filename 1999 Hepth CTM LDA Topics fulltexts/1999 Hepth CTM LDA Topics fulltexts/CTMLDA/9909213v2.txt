1. introduction

denition of m-theory [1][2] using its ten dimensional compactication requires the

knowledge of the behaviour of the kaluza-klein modes of the graviton. these are realized

as the bound states [3] of d0-branes of type iia string theory, originally discovered as

the black holes in the supergravity [4]. the aim of this paper is to get a good grip on the

wavefunction n of the boundstate of n d0-branes, for any n .

of course, the quantum mechanics of n d0-branes contains sectors with n free par-

ticles, with several clumps of d0-branes bound to each other. in other words, for each

partition ~n:

there is a state whose wavefunction looks like:

n = 1  n1 + 2  n2 + . . . + k  nk

~n 

kyl=1

l(xl,1)l(xl,2) . . . l(xl,nl )eipl,1xl,1+...ipl,nl

xl,nl

our approximation contains all such states, which allows to compute the decay rates

and overlaps between multiparticle states and single-particle states.

we are not going to review the arguments in favor of the existence of the bound state

(see, e.g. [5][6][7][8][9][10][11]). we proceed with the variational approach to the problem

of nding of the ground state. to do this we perturb the quantum mechanical problem:
h0  hm. the new problem with the hamiltonian hm has only four supercharges instead
of the sixteen which were the symmetries of h0. but the advantage is the better control on
the spectrum of hm. we then take the approximate ground state of the perturbed model
as the trial wavefunction for the original problem and minimize the bosonic contribution

to the energy with respect to the parameter m of the perturbation. of course the standard

approach would be to minimize the full energy. but our trial wavefunctions are the ground

states of the perturbed hamitlonian so that we need to nd another optimizing criterium.

we suggest to look at the bosonic potential which is for large n parametrically equivalent
to looking at the spread htrx 2i of the ground state. in this way we get for the optimal
value of the parameter |m|  n  2
3 .

as a general remark we would like to stress that our approach cannot be viewed as a

completely satisfactory one, but nevertheless we consider it useful as it allows to study the

large n case and serves as a nice complement to the asymptotic result of [11] for n = 2

and subsequent work [12] (see [13] for the further apology for our point of view). also

1

it seems very simple to generalise our approach for the other gauge groups, rather then

su (n ) thus extending the work [14].

as one of the most interesting applications we suggest to compute the overlap between

two-particle wavefunction with particles of mass n1, n2 and the single state with n =

n1 + n2. we hope to return to this problem in the near future.

2. quantum mechanics

consider the quantum mechanics of d0-branes in type iia theory in the at minkovski

space. as it is well-known [3] in the sector with n particles they are described by the di-
mensional reduction of the u (n ) n = 4 super-yang-mills theory down to 0 + 1 dimensions
(the gauge quantum mechanics with sixteen supersymmetries was introduced a long time

ago [15], and for less number of supercharges in [16]). upon excluding the center-of-mass

motion it becomes su (n )/zn gauge quantum mechanics.

hamiltonian and symmetries. the hamiltonian of the model operates on the spinor

wavefunctions. it is given by [15]:

trpm pm

tr[x m , x n ]2

2

trm [x m , ]

(2.1)

where all elds are traceless hermitian matrices, the indices m, n run from 1 to 9, repeated

indices are summed over, in addition,  are the majorana-weyl fermions of so(9), m

are the dirac matrices of so(9).

the canonical commutation relations are:

[pm,a, x n

b ] = n

m ab,

{,a, ,b} = ab

(2.2)

where a, b are the su (n ) indices.

the supersymmetry of this model is generated by the sixteen supercharges [15]:

q = m

trpm  

i
4

[m , n ]tr[x m , x n ]

(2.3)

it is sometimes convenient to think of this supersymmetric model as of the reduction

of the four dimensional n = 4 super yang-mills theory.
in this formulation only the
s0(3)e  so(6)r part of the global symmetry group so(9) (or more presicely the cover of
the that) is manifest. in our approach we break this symmetry. namely we want to work
in the n = 1 four dimensional terms. the choice of n = 1 subalgebra breaks so(6)r
down to su (3)r.

in the n = 1 four dimensional terms the eld content of the problem is that of a

vector multiplet (a, ) and a triple of chiral multiplets(cid:0)qi, i

(cid:1), with the superpotential

w0 =

ijktrqi[qj, qk]

i
6

the indices  run from 0 to 3, i = 1, 2, 3 is the index in the 3 of su (3)r,  = 1, 2 is the

index in the 2 of the spin cover of so(3)e. the classical vacua are the minima of the

associated potential

deformation. we are going to study the deformed quantum mechanical model, where

the superpotential is replaced by:

wm = w0 +

1
2

mtrqiqi

(2.7)

this deformation breaks the so(9) global symmetry down to so(3)e  so(3)r, where
so(3)r is imbedded into su (3)r as a subgroup of unitary transformations preserving the

metrics ij. the parameter of the deformation is the complex number m.

the deformation (2.7) was succesfully used in four dimensions in the analysis of the
topologically twisted n = 4 theory [17], in the problem of evaluating the index of the
quantum mechanical problem [10], in the arguments in favor of the existence of the bound

state [6] (for prime n ).

3

the critical points of the deformed superpotential are the solutions to:

[qj, qk] = imijkqi

(2.8)

1

i.e.

m qk must form a representation of the sl2 lie algebra. all nite-dimensional repre-
sentations of sl2 are unitary and decompose into sums of the irreducible representations:

n = 1  v1  2  v2 . . .  k  vk,

(2.9)

vl are the multiplicities. the minima of the potential (2.5) must in addition obey

[am, qi] = 0, m = 1, 2, 3,

[am, an] = 0

(2.10)

which implies that am must belong to the lie algebra of

h = s (u (v1)  . . . u (vk)) .

(2.11)

although for generic choice of vis the only massless modes are those of gauge elds taking

values in h, for the special choices of vi one gets extra matter.

let v be the original complex n -dimensional space (the space of chan-paton indices),

vk = cvk the multiplicity space, rk  ck the standard spin k1
then (2.9) can be rewritten as equality of two reprsentations of sl2:

representation of sl2.

v =mk

vk  rk

(2.12)

due to pseudo-reality of the representations of su (2) we have v  v , although this
isomorphism goes through the non-trivial transformation li  l
i . now all the elds
of our quantum mechanical system can be written according to their sl2 transformation

properties.

the gauge eld am  v  v  r1  r3
the fermions i
  v  v  r3  c2
the fermions   v  v  r1  c2
the scalars qi  v  v  r1

the importance of this representation is justied by the following statement:

quadratic approximation the hamiltonian of the model is equal to:

h2 = xelds

c2, c2 =xi

lili

in the

(2.13)

the tensor product v  v always contains at least one component of spin zero. this is
the trace part of the matrices which must be projected out for we deal with su (n ) rather

then u (n ) elds. of course, if more then one vk is dierent from zero then the spin zero
components in the product v  v survive. in the problem of the computation of the index
such choices of ~v contribute zero (see [10] for the principal contribution and [7] for the

boundary terms).

it is perhaps worthwhile mentioning here that the set of massless modes coincide with the
eld content of the theory obtained by orbifolding of the n = 4 super-yang-mills theory
by the so(3) subgroup of su (3) in the spirit of [18][19]1

the next section is devoted to the justication of the claim about the quadratic

casimir. let li be the generators of su (2) in the representation v ,

[li, lj] = iijklk

bosonic potential. write:

qi = m (li + i) ,

q

i(cid:17) ,
i = m(cid:16)li + 

i = i + ii, am = |m|m

(2.14)

(2.15)

with m, i, i being hermitian matrices. a little computation shows that the eective

bosonic potential looks like:

1

1

2xm

trmcm+

|m|4 v =
trijklk ([j, i] + [j, i]) +tr d2

tr (j(c + 2)j + j(c + 2)j)

(2.16)

d =xj
ck = xj

[lj, j]

[lj, [lj, k]]

bosonic eigenmodes. the bosonic potential (2.16) gives masses to nine bosonic traceless

hermitian matrices, provided that the gauge xing is done appropriately. the point is that

the critical points of the superpotential wm form a continious family, due to the invariance

1 the idea to orbifold by the innite subgroups of so(6) arose in the discussion with c. vafa
and was dismissed by both of us as the crazy one. it still looks like the one but may prove to be

useful.

of (2.8) under the complexied gauge transformations from sln (c). the non-compact

part is broken by the presence of the square of the moment map term trpi(cid:16)[qi, q
i ](cid:17)2

the compact part is not. the choice of the representatives li breaks the su (n ) invariance
but by the well-known goldstone eect the gauge group reveals itself in the presence of

but

the massless modes, of the form:

j = i[lj, ],  = 

(2.17)

these massless modes are eventually killed by the gauss law, so we might as well work in

the gauge:

d = 0

(2.18)

to see whether (2.18) is a good gauge choice let us make an innitesimal gauge transfor-
mation `a la (2.17). we see that d changes by ic. if the traceless part of v  v does
not contain spin zero pieces then c is invertible and (2.18) is a good gauge choice. this is

equivalent to the condition vk = k,n , which is the case of our utmost interest.
fermionic potential. the fermionic part of the hamiltonian can be written in the
following way (the indices ,  are raised and lowered with the help of  =  symbol,
the indices i, j, k are raised with the help of ij, we also have a ii pairing):

(2.20)

in the quadratic approximation it reduces to:

, k,]ijk + i

completely higgsed phase. the case of our immediate interest is vk = k,n , i.e. when
the representation is irreducible.
in this case the solution to (2.10) is am = 0 i.e. all
uctuations of ams are massive. in addition, since the irreps of su (2) have no moduli
the uctuations of qi which are orthogonal to the gauge orbit are massive as well. let li
denote the standard generators of su (2) in the n -dimensional representaion:

l3 =diag (j, . . . , j)
l =l1  il2

[l]m1,m =p(j + 1  m)(j  m)

then at the minimum of the potential qi = mli, q

i = mli, am = 0.

3. the size of the bound state

the zero energy eigen-function of the deformed hamiltonian can be approximated

by the gaussian wavefunction, which is annihilated by the quadratic hamiltonian (2.13)

and is localised near the minimum of the potential given by the formulae (2.21). let us

estimate the bosonic spread of this wavefunction.

let us now adjust m so as to minimize . we expect to have small corrections both to the

we want to diagonalize the eective mass operator:

in the basis where the generators of sl2 are represented as (2.21) the eigen-value problem

for the operator (a.1) cm = e is written explicitly as:

reduction to the representation theory problem. let v denote the n -dimensional
representation of su(2), so   hom(v, v ). in solving the eigen-value problem (a.2) we
are allowed to perform the transformations   gh1 where g, h are the group elements

of su (2) acting in v . by applying such transformations we can map the operator cm to

the operator m acting in the space v  v :

m =

3xi=1(cid:0)l2

i  1 + 1  l2

let li = li  1 + 1  li be the generator li acting in v  v . then

m =xi

i.e. it is simply the quadratic casimir acting in the tensor product. clearly, m is diago-
nalized by decomposing v  v into irreducibles:

v  v =

n 1ml=0

rl, m = n 1

l=0 l(l + 1)12l+1

(a.5)

where rl is the spin l irrep of su (2).

the zero mode corresponding to l = 0 is the center-of-mass degree of freedom, 0  1n

and is projected out by the condition that tr = 0.

polynomial representation i. let us form the generating function:

(x, y) = xm,m

mm xj+myj+m

p(j + m)!(j  m)!(j  m)!(j + m)!

(a.6)

(a.7)

then the operator cm is represented by the rst order bi-dierential operator:
cm = 2j(2j + 1)  (xy + 1)2xy + 2j(1 + xy) (xx + yy  2j)

it is natural to pass to the coordinates y,  = xy. then the solution to the eigen-value

problem can be found in the separated form:

(x, y) = yaa()

(a.8)

where for positive a the function a() is a polynomial of degree 2j  a, while for negative
a = b < 0 the function a has to be of the form a() = b b() where b() is a

8

polynomial of degree 2j  b. the function a is an eigen-function of the second-order
dierential operator:

2j  ( + 1)2(cid:0) 2

 + (a + 1) (cid:1) + 2j ( + 1) (2 + a)  4j 2

(a.9)

let t = 1 + . for a  0 introduce generators of sl2 (following the general method of [22]):

+ =  t2t + (2j  a)t
0 = tt  j +

then the operator (a.9) can be written as:

(cid:16)+ + 0  j 

a

(a.11)

which is an upper-triangular matrix in the basis 1, t, . . . , t2ja of the monomials, which

form an invariant subspace for the operator (a.9) in the space of all polynomials (such

operators are called quasi-exactly-solvable [22]) . its diagonal entries are the eigen-values,

hence the spectrum of cm is given by:

en,a = (n  n)(n  n  1), n = 0, . . . , n  1  a,

a = 0, . . . , n  1

(a.12)

for a < 0 the spectrum is identical.

polynomial representation ii. let us form another generating function:

(x, y) = xm,m

mm (x)j+myjm

p(j + m)!(j  m)!(j  m)!(j + m)!

then the operator cm is represented by the rst order bi-dierential operator:

cm = 2j(2j + 1)  (x  y)2xy  2j(x  y) (x  y)

(a.13)

(a.14)

it is natural to pass to the coordinates t = xy
