it is argued that a low energy string may be an aristotelian top, i.e. a rigid body
which however cannot be rotationally excited, but in an external electromagnetic eld
exhibits a sort of precession with a larmor type angular velocity. on the basis of
this observation a proposal is made for a new two steps derivation of the electroweak
standard model from the string dynamics. in the rst step a theory of aristotelian top
is formulated and studied in more detail and in the second step an attempt is made to
derive the electroweak standard model from the top dynamics. before the symmetry
breaking fermions are represented by straight frozen strings - rotators, whose symmetry
under the rotation around their axes is interpreted as the group u (1)y . the emergence
of su (2)l group is somewhat less transparent and is supposed to be connected with
the new degree of freedom of relativistic rotators, which leads to the up and down type
fermions. the symmetry breaking is associated with the bending of the rotators under
the inuence of higgs eld and with their subsequent transformation into the curved
frozen strings - tops. in this new picture of electroweak interaction the chirality of the
theory has a simple and natural explanation, the weak isospin and hypercharge are
inherent properties of relativistic rotators/tops and the superselection rule associated
with electric charge is a consequence of the accepted distinction between up and down
type fermions.

1. introduction

string theory is regarded as the most promising candidate for the unied eld theory,
including gravity, free of innities and capable of solving the problem of phenomeno-
logical constants of the standard model [1]. so far this program has been realized in a
modest extent in the form of string-derived models such as calabi-yau compactication
[2] or orbifold models [3]. one can include here also string-motivated models as for in-
stance ipped su (5)  u (1) [4], or string no-scale supergravity [5]. the main problem
on the way to a theory of everything is the selection of true vacuum from among many
possibilities and the determination of the corresponding expectation values of general-
ized higgs elds. it is clear that in such a situation it is necessary in modelbuilding to
combine deductive methods with inductive and intuitive ones.

in the present paper a proposal is made for a new two steps derivation of the elec-
troweak standard model (ewsm) from the string dynamics (the prospect for derivation
of qcd will be shortly discussed in conclusions). in the rst step (see fig.1) it is argued
that a low energy string with frozen vibrational and rotational degrees of freedom is a
top which however cannot be rotationally excited and consequently has a lowest value
of spin, in case of fermions equal 1/2.

aristotelian top  standard model

fig.1

in an external e.g.
electromagnetic eld the top exhibits a sort of precession with
larmor type angular velocity since a precession is not connected with spin excitation.
a top which can rotate in external eld only is an exotic object and will be called the
aristotelian top (at) in what follows, in view of the obvious reference to aristotelian
dynamics.

despite the nonconventional nature of at its dynamics can be formulated in a con-
sistent way, as it has been shown in a series of papers [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], where a
model of spinning particle realized through at was elaborated for the purpose of path
integrals.
it was shown there that the theory of at is much more simple than the
theory of conventional top [11]. for instance the quantization of at leads to dirac
equation in a straightforward manner, in contrast to the quantization procedure in case
of conventional relativistic top, where one is confronted with serious problems.

in the second step the nal derivation of ewsm is investigated by a transition
from at to ewsm under the assumption that nothing substantial has been lost in the
transition. for instance a tacit assumption has been made that at has retained those

2

properties of string which are substantial for the derivation of ewsm. this assumption
seems to be satised. actually, as it is well known, the canonical quantization of strings
gives only the spectrum of various excitations of a free string. to get a more rigorous
and complete quantization one has to apply path integrals, which automatically lead to
a perturbative theory, including hopefully the standard model.

this state of aairs fully corresponds to the situation of quantization of at. here
also the canonical quantization leads to the spectrum of free ats and does not represent
the complete and consistent quantum theory. due to the peculiar properties of at the
canonical equations of motion for the rotation of a free at are reducible and decouple
into separate equations for canonically conjugated variables qi and pi (for the denitions
of canonically conjugated variables for top see sec. 2). as a result there is no quantum
mechanical correlations between qi and pi, the principle of complementarity does not
work for free ats. in order to generate the quantum dispersions  pi,  qi it is necessary
to couple at to quantized elds and to choose the values of coupling constants in such
a way as to reach the saturation of the indeterminacy relations  pi  qi  . the free
at becomes then quantized due to the interaction with the quantum uctuations of the
gauge elds. in other words a consistent quantization of at also requires perturbative
quantum eld theory in order to generate quantum mechanical dispersions through the
radiation corrections.

in the present paper we restrict ourselves to the fermionic ats, i.e. fermionic strings.
the gauge as well as higgs elds will be treated here as genuine elds necessary for
quantization, but their stringy nature will be ignored.

an important topic which must be discussed here concerns spin of at/string. al-
ready the nonrelativistic quantum theory of conventional tops [12] revealed the inter-
esting fact that tops can have both integral and half-integral spins, provided they are
elementary objects, i.e. they have no composite structure. this condition is essential,
since in opposite case the rotation of the top could be reduced to orbital motion of its
constituents (as in the case of molecules) and the orbital motion cannot lead to half-
integral spins. thus the condition of elementarity radically restricts candidates among
subatomic objects for a top with half integral spin. in fact the only objects which fulll
the condition of elementarity and at the same time are spatially extended are strings
themselves. we thus consider the tops with spin 1/2 as fully legitimate representatives
of spin 1/2 particles.

as a result the conventional low energy superstrings do not fall into the category
of ats considered here, since they involve grassmannian variables in their description.
neither the original bosonic strings do, because they possess only integral angular mo-
menta. we have come to a surprising conclusion that the upper vertex of the triangle
in fig. 1 seems to be vacant, there is no string known that would t the spin 1/2 at
in the low energy limit. however this conclusion in fact only shows that our top-down
strategy we have followed so far has failed. the reversed bottom-up strategy dictates
that we have to start with at (if it really leads to ewsm) and nd the corresponding
string. in the appendix b some arguments will be given that such string does exist.
these arguments are based on a well known theorem from the dierential geometry
stating that a curve in 3d space given by parametric equation x = x() can be equiv-

3

alently characterized by a set of equations for three orthogonal unit vectors t = t(),
n = n(), b = b(), the tangent, normal and binormal vectors and a vector x = x(0)
which denes the boundary point on the string. the vectors t, n, b for any  can
be interpreted as unit vectors dening the body coordinate system of a top. we can
then pass to euler angles determining the conguration of the top in space:  = (),
 = (),  = (). thus we can choose either original kinematics for the description
of the string, x = x(), in which the string is sequence of points, or a new kinematics,
in which a string is a sequence of tops. clearly one can expect that in the second case
the string would have both integral and half-integral angular momenta. in the present
paper we will not try to derive the string equations of motion in the new kinematics
since the more urgent task is to ascertain whether qcd follows from at, too. also
the issue of the coupling constants calculation can be treated in the framework of at
without the explicit reference to strings.

the paper consists of three parts. in the rst, introductory, part (sec. 2 and 3)
a nonrelativistic theory of at is considered.
it shows how to introduce canonically
conjugate variables for a top (since lagrangian theory of at does not exist) and also it
shows the origin of u (1)y symmetry. the second part (sec. 4, 5, 6) is devoted to the
relativistic theory of free massless and massive tops. it is shown that a very suitable
framework for this theory represents the dynamical group so(3, 3). namely this group
contains as a subgroup the group of right-handed and left-handed rotations of the top
so(3)  so(3), as well as the lorentz group so(3, 1). note that since the top involves
for its description euler angles the lorentz transformations of euler angles follow from
the mathematical formalism developed here. the third part (sec. 7, 8, 9,10) contains
an attempt to derive ewsm from at. first, the relativistic version of sec. 3 is given.
then it is shown that there are two kinds of rotators/tops, which dier in the lorentz
transformation properties of euler angles. it is assumed that they correspond to up
and down type fermions. the assumption is based on the existence of a superselection
rule associated with these two sorts of rotators/tops. in sec. 10 the origin of the group
su (2)l  u (1)y is discussed from the point of view of dirac equation. finally it is
argued that the simplest mechanism for breaking the gauge symmetry in our approach
is the aristotelian deformation of rotator (i.e. bending without vibration). however no
denite model for the description of this process can be oered so far.

2. rotators with integral spins

in this and the next section a nonrelativistic model of at will be developed in order
to show its relationship to ewsm, in particular to the generation of gauge symmetries,
which will be described here by u (1)a  u (1)z group. the most important property of
this model is that it points to the possible origin of u (1)z (that is u (1)y ) symmetry,
which will be associated with the symmetry of straight string - rotator - under the rota-
tions around its axis. this conjecture is supported by two arguments. first, it will be
shown that this rotational symmetry has a gauge nature and, second, the corresponding
interaction with the gauge eld violates parity.

4

the main problem in the interpretation of fermions as rotators before symmetry
breaking is the integral spin of the latter. clearly it is necessary to modify the dynamics
of rotators in such a way that half-integral spins are not forbidden. this necessity is
underlined by the fact that the rotator is a particular case of a top. how is it possible
that tops can possess both integral and half-integral spins, while rotators only integral
ones ? to answer this question we start with lagrangian of the free nonrelativistic
symmetric top

l =

i1
2

( 2 sin2  + 2) +

(  cos  + )2

(2.1)

i3
2

where i1, i3 are moments of inertia. putting i3 = 0 we obtain lagrangian for the rotator

l =

i
2

( 2 sin2  + 2)

with i1 = i. this implies the primary constraint

p =

l
 

= 0

the canonical hamiltonian is

hc = p  + p  + p   l =

=

1
2i

(p2

 +

1

sin 

p2
)

(2.2)

(2.3)

(2.4)

there are two alternatives how to proceed further: either one suppresses the variables
, p completely and restricts to angles ,  only, or one retains formally the original
3-dimensional conguration space, in which however  plays now the role of a gauge
variable. we shall follow the second route, since we want to maintain the contact with
the top dynamics as close as possible. in that case the constraint (2.3) is taken in the
weak sense, i.e. as an initial condition.

instead of canonical hamiltonian hc one introduces in this case the extended hamil-

tonian

h = hc + a(t)p

(2.5)

where a(t) is an arbitrary function, reecting the fact that we have to do with a gauge
system. the generating function of an innitesimal gauge transformation is

the transformed hamiltonian reads

f = p(t)

h  = h +

f
t

= hc + a(t)p

where a(t) = a(t) +  (t). note also that

 =  + {f, } =  + (t)

5

in quantum theory the constraint (2.3) implies




(, , ) = 0

(2.6)

when taken as an initial condition (2.6) holds in fact for any t, because the operator

 commutes with the operator form of the hamiltonian (2.5). the wave function  of
the top can be expressed by means of the functions ds
mk(, , ), the matrix elements
of an irreducible representation of the so(3) group. the constraint (2.6) can be fullled
for k = 0 only, which implies an integral spin s. we conclude that the integral spin of
rotators is a consequence of (2.3), which follows from the particular form of lagrangian
(2.2).

the classical model of spinning particle elaborated in [6] involves non-standard ap-
proach in that this model cannot be described by a lagrangian. due to the absence
of the rotational kinetic energy in the hamiltonian the spinning particle is a non-
lagrangian object, but can be described in the framework of the standard canonical
formalism. the canonical hamiltonian, including orbital degrees of freedom, is

hc =

1
2m

(p 

e
c

a)2 + ea0  .b

(2.7)

where  = e

mc s is the magnetic moment and the components of spin s are

s1 = 23  32 + 

s2 = 31  13 +

1 + 2

where i, i are canonically conjugated variables and i are dened by means of euler

s3 = 12  21

(2.8)

1 = e sin  sin 

2 = e sin  cos 

3 = e cos 

 =q2

i = e

(2.9)

since the hamiltonian (2.7) does not involve rotational kinetic energy it does not contain
moments of inertia. therefore conventional transition to rotator (i3 = 0) is no longer
possible.

despite this fact one can realize the rotator mode of the top by introducing the

gauge symmetry as in (2.5)

h = hc + a(t)s

(2 .10)

where s

and the new hamiltonian

3 = 3isi = ii is the projection of spin to the symmetry axis parallel to the unit
 . the generating function for the gauge symmetry is again f = (t)s

3

h  = h + {h, f } +

f
t

= h +  (t)s
3

has the same form as the old one due to the vanishing poisson brackets

{si, s

3} = 0

the arbitrary function a(t), which transforms according to equation

a(t) = a(t) +  (t)

(2.11)

(2.12)

has formally the status of a physical variable. as a result the action s must be varied
with respect to this variable and one obtains

h
a

= s

3 = 0

(2.13)

i.e. the same constraint as in the case of the conventional rotator and with the same
conclusion concerning the integral spins.

in the next section we shall show that in order to get half-integral spin it is necessary,
in addition to the choice of non-conventional hamiltonian (2.10), to change also the
interpretation of a(t) and (t).

3. rotators with integral and half-integral spins

in order to reformulate the gauge transformations for the nonrelativistic rotator it

is useful to start with the corresponding action integral

s =z t2

t1

(i i  r)dt  2i2i

where r is the routh function [6]

r = 

1
2

mv2 + ea0  e

v
c

.a  .b + as
3

(3.1)

(3.2)

this function plays the role of a hamiltonian with respect to rotational coordinates i, i
and the role of a lagrangian (with the opposite sign) with respect to orbital coordinates.

7

as mentioned before, our top is a non-lagrangian object and cannot be characterized
by a pure lagrangian.

in the new approach to gauge transformations we shall assume that the particle
interacts with some vector eld z in addition to the electromagnetic eld a and that

a(t) = 

g


(z 0 

v
c

.z)

(3.3)

where z is taken in the point x = x(t), the position of the particle. furthermore we
put

(t) = (x(t), t)

where (x) is an arbitrary function of x. the gauge transformation (2.12) leads now to
the conventional vector potential transformation

z

= z +

c
g


x

(3.4)

note that the original meaning of a(t) and (t) as arbitrary functions of t remains
preserved: arbitrariness of a(t) is for instance associated with the arbitrariness proper
to any gauge eld characterized by a vector potential.

the decisive moment of the new interpretation of gauge transformation is connected

with the introduction of a new term in the action integral, namely the term

where

sf ield = 

1

4z g g dv dt

g = z   z

(3.5)

this term is an obvious consequence of the new interpretation of a(t) as given by (3.3).
the formal status of a(t) as a physical variable is now transferred to z(x). variation
of s with respect to this function would lead without (3.5) to inconsistencies. after
inclusion of sf ield this variation leads to the eld equations for z. the coulomb law
following from these equations

g.ds =

zs

g


s
3

(3.6)

is now the correct replacement of (2.13) as a gauge constraint. the new constraint (3.6),
unlike (2.13), can be fullled in quantum theory both for integral and half-integral spins,
since it is a condition on the eld g and not on s
3.

so we come to the conclusion that half-integral spin of rotators is possible under two
conditions:
i. rotators do not have rotational kinetic energy, ii. the function a(t) in
(3.2) must be interpreted as (3.3), i.e. an interaction with a new vector eld must be
introduced.

note that a nite gauge transformation reads

i = ei

the action integral (3.1) with

i = ei


r =

mv2 + ea0  e

v

3(z 0

where g/ is a coupling constant, is invariant with respect to (3.7), since

i i  i i  s
3(


t

+


x

.v)

(3.7)

(3.8)

(3.9)

and the last term on the right hand side of (3.9) cancels with the term coming from r.
note that the last term in (3.8) violates parity, since s,
3 is a pseudoscalar - a projection
of spin s on the symmetry axis, s

3 = 3.s.

summarizing the results of the last two sections we can say that the fermionic
nature of rotators requires that the rotational symmetry be realized through the gauge
symmetry u (1)z, assuming that rotator interacts with some vector eld z. taking
into account the standard interaction with electromagnetic eld a we see that the total
gauge symmetry is u (1)a  u (1)z.

4. classical theory of massless tops

in [6] the classical theory of point-like massive tops was elaborated. here we shall
show that this theory can be easily extended to massless tops. the starting point is
the group so(3, 3), which reects the fact that the most general motion of a top can
be regarded as right-handed and left-handed rotations. the generators of this group
sab, a, b = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 obey the poisson brackets relations

{sab, scd} = gbdsac + gacsbd  gbcsad  gadsbc

(4.1)

where diag gab = 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1. the expressions for sab are given in appendix a.
the standard approach to spinning particles is based on the representation of poincare
group. on the classical level the generators of this group are p and m  = xp 
x p + s . the casimir invariants are p2 and w2, where w is pauli-lubanski vector

w =

1
2

ps

(4.2)

in our case the spinning particle is realized through top, so that besides p2 and w2

other invariants exist, namely

u = s45,

v = ps4,

w = ps5

(4.3)

for which it holds

{m , u } = 0,

{m , v } = 0,

{m , w } = 0

(4.4)

9

one can also show that

{w, u } = 0,

{w, v } = 0,

{w, w } = 0

(4.5)

when p2 = m2 6= 0, the quantities u, v /m, w/m form the lie algebra of left-handed
rotations of the top. in case p2 = 0 one can derive the relations

{v, w } = 0,

{v, u } = w,

{w, u } = v

(4.6)

from (4.6) it follows that the group of left-handed motions of the massless top is e(2),
the group of motions in the euclidean plane. the group of right-handed motions is given
by the little lorentz group, which is conventionally dened for standard momentum
p = p(1, 0, 0, 1). from the denition of w we have

w0 = p.s,

w = p0s  p  n

where

and one obtains

s = (s23, s31, s12)

n = (s01, s02, s03)

w0 = ps3

w1 = p(s1 + n2)

w2 = p(s2  n1)

w3 = ps3

(4.7)

the lie algebra of right-handed motions corresponds also to e(2)

{w1, w2} = 0,

{w1, s3} = w2,

{w2, s3} = w1

(4.8)

casimir invariants of both algebras are v 2 + w 2 and w2
show that

1 + w2

2, respectively. we shall

v 2 + w 2 = w2

1 + w2

2

(4.9)

for this purpose we rst introduce complex vector

u  = s4 + is5

from the denitions of sab given in appendix a one can derive for u  and complex
conjugate vector u  the following relations

u u  + u u  = 2ss 


denoting p = pu  one gets from (4.10)

v 2 + w 2 = p p  = pp ss 


10

(4.10)

(4.11)

from the denition of w it follows

w2 =

1
2

ss p2 + ppss 


using the expressions for s given in appendix a one becomes

if p2 = m2 6= 0, then eq. (4.11) - (4.13) imply

s s = 2u 2



w2
m2 = u 2 +

v 2
m2 +

w 2
m2

(4.12)

(4.13)

(4.14)

the last relation reects the fact that the laboratory and the body components of spin
lead to the same absolute value of spin.

in case of massless particle one gets instead of (4.14) the equation

w2 = v 2 + w 2

(4.15)

if one takes into account that for p = p(1, 0, 0, 1) one has w0 = w3, then from (4.15)
one obtains (4.9).

5. quantum theory of massless tops

we summarize rst the quantum theory of massive tops given in [7]. quantum
mechanical generators of so(3, 3) group are dened in appendix a. they can be ob-
tained from their classical expressions by the conventional replacement i  
up
i
to the ordering ambiguity (for simplicity the factor i is omitted) and they obey the
commutation relations

[sabscd] = gbdsac + gacsbd  gbcsad  gadsbc

(5.1)

the ordering problem was solved in [7] by means of the requirement that the rep-
resentation of so(3, 3) be nite dimensional (in order to get the conventional nite
dimensional representations of lorentz group). this leads to tops with some spin s
(integral or half-integral). taking s = 1/2 one gets tops, which can assume unique spin
value characteristic for conventional fermionic particles (leptons and quarks).

the generators of poincare group are

p = i,

m  = i(x  x)  is

components of pauli-lubanski vector of a massless particle for standard momentum
p = p(1, 0, 0, 1) have the form similar to (4.7)

w0 = pi3

11

w1 = p(i1 + n2)

w2 = p(i2  n1)

w3 = pi3

(5.2)

where ii can be obtained from the classical expressions (2.8) by means of the replacement
i  
i

and n is dened as follows

n = 3  i + s3

(5.3)

here the term s3 comes from the ordering ambiguity and we assume that s = 1/2.

as in the classical case lie algebra of e(2) group can be derived

[w1, w2] = 0,

[w1, i3] = w2,

[w2, i3] = w2

(5.4)

the quantum analogues of (4.3) are

u = 3.i,

v = 

1
2

(p + pc),

w =

1
2i

(p  pc)

(5.5)

where p = pu , pc = pu 

c and

u 0 = .i

u 0

c =  .i

u = i  i + is

uc = i   i  is 

with  dened in appendix a. in analogy with (4.4) and (4.5) it holds

[m , u ] = 0,

[m , v ] = 0,

[m , w ] = 0

[w, u ] = 0,

[w, v ] = 0,

[w, w ] = 0

the left-handed motions of the massless top are given also by the e(2) group

[v, w ] = 0,

[v, u ] = w,

[w, u ] = v

(5.6)

(5.7)

(5.8)

(5.9)

the quantum analogues of eq. (4.10) can be derived from the denitions (5.6) and the
results reads

u 

c u  + u u 

c = 2ss 

 + 4s  2s(s + 2)g

(5.10)

this implies

pcp + p pc = 2pp ss 

  2s(s + 2)p2

in virtue of eq. (4.12), which can be extended to quantum theory without any change
and also due to equation

ss = 2u 2  2s(s + 2)

12

(5.11)

we obtain

v 2 + w 2 + u 2p2 = w2

(5.12)

for p2 = m2 6= 0 this relation is the quantum counterpart of eq. (4.14). for m2 = 0 we
get in analogy with (4.9)

v 2 + w 2 = w2

1 + w2

2

(5.13)

thus the generators w1, w2, i3, v, w, u form the lie algebra of e(2)  e(2) group for
which however the constraint (5.13) holds.

we have come to the conclusion that the notion of at has a well dened physical and
mathematical meaning. the object under study is a top/rotator, since it is described
by the group so(3)  so(3) of right - handed and left - handed rotations characteristic
for massive tops and similar group e(2)  e(2) for massless tops/rotators.
it is an
aristotelian top/rotator since there is no term in the routh function corresponding to
the rotational kinetic energy (see (3.8) and (7.2)) and so there is no rotational excitation
of the top/rotator.
in quantum theory the operator ordering can be always chosen
so that the top has the only spin value s = 1/2, in accordance with no excitation
assumption.

6. quantum mechanical states

in the beginning of sec. 5 it was mentioned that by xing the operator ordering in
the expressions for n, u and uc, which is controlled by a parameter s, one can select
spin 1/2 particle as the only allowed state of the massive top. on the rst sight this
conclusion may seem controversial since intuitively one expects from a wave function
of three variables like (i) the existence of innite many states. therefore it will be
instructive to repeat similar arguments and as we shall see, with similar results for the
massless top.

the wave function (x, i) of a free massless top must obey the equations

p2 = 0

(v 2 + w 2) = 

(6.1)

(6.2)

(the minus sign in (6.2) reects the fact that the true quantum mechanical operators
are iv and iw ). the solutions of (6.1) and (6.2) should be sought in the space,
in which the unitary representations of the group e(2)  e(2) are dened. since e(2)
is non-compact these representations are either innite-dimensional or one-dimensional.
the former should be excluded according to conventional wisdom [13], since otherwise
they would lead to innite degeneracy of states with a given momentum p. such de-
generacy would cause e.g. inconsistencies in the description of statistical properties of
systems consisting of such particles. therefore one should restrict to one-dimensional
representations, which correspond to  = 0.
13

from the point of view of so(3, 3) group this restriction corresponds to integral or
half-integral s. the value s = 1/2 denes an operator ordering which selects spin 1/2
as the only allowed spin value of the particle.

for a given value of  the wave function  is specied also by eigenvalues of the

operator iv or iw . since  = 0 one obtains instead of (6.2) two equations

v  = 0

w  = 0

in [7] matrix representations of v and w for s = 1/2 were found

where

v  = +vmatr

w  = wmatr

and  is dirac wave function in the spinor representation. eq. (6.3) then imply

(6.3)

(6.5)

(6.5)

(6.6)

(6.7)

the conclusion, which can be drawn from these considerations is quite remarkable:
under the accepted operator ordering the only quantum mechanical states of the massless
top are those, which satisfy eq. (6.7). this is to be compared with classical states, which
are restricted by the condition p2 = 0 only, leaving i, i arbitrary.

the explanation of this paradox will be discussed in conclusions, where it will be
indicated that the restriction to nite dimensional representations of lorentz group has
no real ground. in fact it is sucient to choose a weaker condition, namely that the
spin should be 1/2, but the representation of lorentz group may be both nite and
innite dimensional. in this case 2 is arbitrary and the quantum counterpart of the
classical at is in general described by a wave function (x, i) with the transformation

properties, which correspond to the innite (2 6= 0) and nite (2 = 0) dimensional
representation of lorentz group.

7. classical relativistic aristotelian rotator

in this section we will give the relativistic version of the theory considered in sec. 3.

again we start with the action

sr =z 2

1

(i i  r)d  2i2i

(7.1)

the evolution parameter  is associated with the worldline x = x( ) of the rotator
and the routh function r is assumed to have the form

r =

+ (ea + ez z + e

(ef + ez f z

 = z  z and u = dx

where f z
d . the action (7.1) is reparametrization invariant,
which is guaranteed by auxiliary variable  transforming under the reparametrization
in the following way

  = f ( ),

 =

df ( )

d



this variable is determined by xing the evolution parameter. the proper time inter-
pretation of  corresponds to  = m, where m is the mass of the rotator.

there is no rotational kinetic energy term in (7.2), rotator cannot be rotationally
excited, it is of aristotelian type. moreover the action (7.1) is invariant under gauge
transformations

i = ei
 
i = ei


z 

 = z 

1
e
z


x

(7.3)

which guarantees that the particle under consideration is really a rotator. the action
(7.1) is of course invariant also with respect to the ordinary gauge transformations of
electromagnetic potentials a. note that we have included in r terms proportional to
the coupling constant ez in order to obtain the most general coupling to z. from the
quantum theory of the rotator based on the dirac equation (see sec. 9) it follows that

e
z =

cludes also the eld contributions sa, sz

the classical hamiltonian which corresponds to a routh function r is dened as

where p = r

variation of the action (7.1) with respect to  leads to the condition

from (7.6) it then follows

or taking into account (7.6)

(7.6)

(7.7)

(7.8)

as for the internal (rotational) variables the equations of motion can be most simply
written in the poisson bracket form

dsab

d

= {h, sab}

(7.9)

the explicit form of this equation can be obtained using the poisson bracket relation
(4.1).

8. two kinds of rotators and tops

in this section we will show that there are two kinds of rotators and tops and the
dierence between them is manifested by the dierent behaviour under lorentz trans-
formations.

to this aim let us rst introduce slightly generalized canonically conjugated 4-
component variables  = (0, i),  = (0, i), which are however subjected to con-
straints

2
0  2
2
0  2

i = 0
i = 0

due to these constraints poisson brackets should be replaced by dirac brackets

{, } = g 




{, } = {, } = 0

((8.1))

(8.2)

where  = 00  ii and g is the usual space-time metric tensor. one can easily
verify that constraints (8.1) are consistent with dirac bracket relations (8.2) . note that
despite the vectorial form of eq. (8.1) and (8.2)  and  are not fourvectors!

the relation between i and  is

i = i 

0

i

the inverse one reads

i = i

i;

0 =

as for  the relation is simple

 = (, i)

(8.3)

(8.4)

(8.5)

one can show that from the dirac bracket relations (8.2) and the eq. (8.3) the standard
poisson brackets relations follow

{i, k} = ik
{i, k} = {i, k} = 0

(8.6)

as expected.

note that

0 0  i i = i i

and 00  ii = ii
17

so that action integral (7.1) can be easily expressed by means of variables , . also
the generators of the so(3, 3) group can be expressed in new variables. first of all one
gets from (2.8)

s1 = 23  32 

s2 = 31  13 

s3 = 12  21

01
2
1 + 2

02

(8.7)

here we have used relations (8.3) and the variables  =p2

i in (2.8) was interpreted as
0 in order that s1, s2 be single-valued functions of . this requirement is necessary
to obtain unique extension of si from the region 0 > 0 to the region 0 < 0. the
expression (8.7) for si are then linear functions of  and rational functions of . in
i   to the value 0 = .

this way one can pass smoothly from the value 0 = p2

when one returns back to the variables i in (8.7) one obtains

s1 = 23  32 +

s2 = 31  13 +

s3 = 12  21

note that si dened by ( 8.8 ) full the standard poisson brackets relations

{si, sj} = ijksk

(8.8)

(8.9)

for both values of 0 = . the same is true for all other generators of so(3, 3) group.
to show that let us rst generalize the unit vectors 3 and  , originally dened for
0 =  in the appendix a. the generalized expressions read

i
1 + 2

actually, one can easily show that 3 and  obey the relations

 2 = 1

.  = 2

 2 = 0

3. = 0

(8.11)

3   = i

    = 2i3

18

irrespective of sgn 0. furthermore it holds

{si, 3j} = ijk3k
{si, j} = ijkk

also for both signs of 0.

taking into account the denitions of the remaining so(3, 3) generators

n = s  3

u 0 = s.,
u 0 = s. ,

u = is  
u = is   

u = s.3

(8.12)

(8.13)

and eq. (8.11), (8.12), one sees that the poisson brackets of any two generators lead to
the same result , regardless of the sign of 0 and so the relations (4.1) hold for 0 = .
since the action of so(3, 3) does not shift any point from the region 0 =  to 0 = 
and vice versa, 0/ behaves with respect to sab like a constant and one can express
this fact formally as follows

{sab,

0


} = 0

(8.14)

in conclusion one can say that there are two actions (7.1) associated with two dif-
ferent routh functions, denoted as ru,d. in ru the generators sab correspond conven-
tionally to 0 = , while in rd they correspond to 0 = +. besides this the coupling
constants: e, ez, e
z are in general dierent in ru and rd. in the next section we shall
argue that these two routh functions correspond to two fermions with dierent electric
charges. the main argument will be based on the quantum version of eq. (8.14) indicat-
ing that there is an observable (0/) whose operator commutes with the operators of
all other observables, associated with the system under consideration. such an operator
generates the superselection rule connected with the electric charge.

here we shall restrict ourselves to another, more formal, distinction between the tops
( rotators ) corresponding to 0 =  as manifested by the transformation properties
under lorentz group. an innitesimal lorentz transformation is characterized by the
generating function f = n  v  s   and the corresponding transformation of i
reads

i  i + {f, i} = i +

(8.15)

f
i

since n, s have dierent form for 0 =  the variables i transform dierently in these
 transforms under rotations like an
two cases.

law:

in particular the unit vector 3i = i

in either cases the quadratic form 2

3i is invariant, so that also the equation

19

is lorentz invariant. in the special case of rotator the vector 3 determines its symmetry
axis and the eq.
(8.16) gives two dierent transformation rules for this axis under
lorentz boosts.

9. in the search of a rational reconstruction of ewsm

in this and the next section we will summarize and analyze the logical steps necessary
for a nal reconstruction of ewsm from the string dynamics via the aristotelian top.
in the rst step we must realize that the string dynamics at low energies is greatly
inuenced by the large energy value of the rst excitation level o(ep l). consequently
for energies e  ep l, which cover the region of validity of ewsm the vibrational and
rotational degrees of freedom cannot be excited, they are frozen. this however does
not mean that there cannot be any rotational motion at all. we assume that (besides
the orbital motion of the string as a whole) a rotation in the external eld is possible,
leading to the process of spin precession. such an assumption was tested in [6] and it was
shown there that it leads to consistent theory of spinning particle. we also anticipate
that in the higgs eld string can change its shape, causing in this manner the gauge
symmetry breaking, without generating the vibrational excitations. we thus come to
the conclusion that an aristotelian regime sets up when we approach the low energy
limit. in this regime the motion of string (rotation and shape deformation) is possible
only if the string is subjected to some external cause - an external (gauge or/and higgs)
eld.

as for the equation of motion for the aristotelian string one can extend the theory
elaborated in (6) for motion in an electromagnetic eld to any gauge eld. this was
done in previous sections. however we have no clear idea how to get the interaction
with higgs eld from the rst principles. in such situation one can borrow the whole
higgs sector from ewsm and assume that string is straight line - a rotator - in the false
higgs vacuum. the bending of string is associated with the transition of higgs eld to
the true vacuum. however one does not see how the curvature of string is controlled by
the higgs eld in such transition. from this point of view a more appealing approach is
oered by the theory of elasticity, where the phenomenon of elastic instability, similar
to that generated by higgs eld, is known for long time. it consists in bending of beam,
whose one end is xed and the other is loaded by a force acting parallel to the beam.
it is known that when the force exceeds some critical value the initially straight beam
bends and the axial rotational symmetry is violated. note that this process is given in
[14] as an example of spontaneous symmetry breaking in connection with ewsm!

in the present paper we will not develop these speculative ideas further and in what
follows in constructing the aristotelian equations of motion we will restrict ourselves to
gauge elds and to the rotational degrees of freedom, only. the interaction with the
higgs eld will be taken over from ewsm.

in the second step we will take into account the consequences resulting from the fact
that there is no term in the hamiltonian (7.6) corresponding to the kinetic energy of

20

the rotational motion. due to this there is no relation between the angular velocity i
and the canonical momenta i, and in virtue of this there is no quantum mechanical
correlation between i and i. in the conventional quantum theory of point particles the
relation pi = mxi guarantees the expansion of wave packet and equivalence of canonical
and path integral quantization. when the rotational kinetic energy is missing in the
hamiltonian the path integration does not lead to any expansion of spin wave packet
and the equivalence between the two procedures of quantization is lost.

on the rst sight this may signal an internal inconsistency of at, but a closer look
reveals that it is not so. in sec. 2 and 3 we have seen that the rotator mode of the
top can be realized only through the interaction with some gauge vector eld which
is responsible for the rotator u (1) symmetry. thus, there cannot be free rotator/top,
it must interact with the gauge eld. at least it must be thought as interacting with
the vacuum uctuations of the gauge elds. this interaction generates the quantum
mechanical dispersions of the euler angles, or equivalently i. in other words it leads
to the expansion of the i-part of the wave function. to see that let us consider a
propagation of at from the point x1 to x2 and let us assume that the variables i have
in x1 sharp values i = 1i. the path connecting x1 and the x2 goes through the gauge
eld, so that i is changed depending on the path. in x2 the wave function will then be
in general dierent from zero for all possible values of i. in [7] the propagator of at
in an external electromagnetic eld was derived by means of path integrals and it was
shown there that the spin wave functions +,  + given by (6.6) are reproduced in the
propagation of at. as a result any spin state can be expressed as linear combination
of the components of +,  +. but these functions were in sec. 6 introduced as the
result of canonical quntization, so that there is a strong evidence that canonical and
path intergral quantization can be reconciled if one takes at as whole, i.e.
including
its gauge elds.

if so, one can perform in the third step canonical quantization by formal replacement
i  
, as shown in sec. 5. by means of a suitable ordering of operators in the
i
expressions for sab one can achieve that s = 1
2 is the only allowed value of spin of
the top, in accordance with its aristotelian nature. the representation space of the
generators sab is spanned on the basis d1/2
2 , denoted here
as +,  + (see (6.6)). a massless top is described by the group e(2)  e(2) (sec. 5).
its wave function  fulls the equation (6.3)

km (, , ), k =  1

2 , m =  1

v  = 0,

w  = 0

(9.1)

where v and w are two commuting generators of the group e(2). the solution of (9.1)
can be expressed as  = +(i)(x) where + = (+,  +) and  is the solution of
dirac equation (see sec. 6).

10. an attempt to derive su (2)l  u (1)y gauge symmetry

in the forth step on the basis of sec. 8 we take rst into account two kinds of

21

parametrized by the coordinates i, 0 = p2

rotators (tops). this allows us to distinguish between up type and down type fermions
and to introduce the weak isospin. the conguration space consists of two subspaces
i . the representation space is spanned
on the basis (0)+(i), 0(0)+(i), where +(i) is dened by (6.6) and + =
(+,  +) forms the spinorials basis for 0 = . to nd this basis we rst observe
that the transition from 0 =  to 0 =  in the generators sab is equivalent to the
transformation i  i, i  i (see eq. (8.8)). in case of generators u , u 
c , in
addition, one has to change the sign: u   u , u 
c  u 
c , too (see the expressions
(8.10) for i). however by a redenition of u , u 
c one can omit this change of sign,
so that the transition to region 0   is then the same for all sab and is realized
through the replacement i  i. note that this redenition is consistent with the
commutation relations for sab (5.1).

the basis for 0   is then dened as follows

 + =  +(i) = 

i

2 (ie

i

2  sin

, e i

2  cos


2


2

)

+ = +(i) =  i

2 (ie

i

2 var cos

, ie i

2  sin


2


2

)

the extended generators have the form

sab
ext = (0)sab(i) + (0)sab(i)

and the corresponding wave functions are

(10.1)

(10.2)

ext(x, ) = +(i)e(x)(0) + +(i)(x)(0)

(10.3)

where e(x) and (x) are the wave functions of charged and neutral leptons respectively.

as indicated in sec. 8, a superselection rule holds in the representation space of the

operators sab

ext . the operator 0

 commutes with all sab

[sab
ext ,

0


] = 0

(10.4)

and the relative phases of functions +(i)e(x)(0) and +(i)v(x)(0) are arbi-
trary, since their product is always zero due to (0)(0) = 0. as a result the rep-
resentation space can be decomposed into the direct sum of two incoherent subspaces
labeled by two discrete values of 0
 . the only interpretation of this superselection rule
that can be considered in the present context is associated with the electric charge and
this is the reason why the states belonging to dierent 0
 have been interpreted as up
and down type fermions. with respect to this duplication of fermionic states the wave
equations (9.1) must be replaced by

vextext = 0,

wextext = 0

(10.5)

where vext and wext are dened by means of sab
ext .

22

the equations (10.5) as they stand hold for genuine tops. to extend their validity

to rotators one must implement the axial symmetry of rotators.

this leads to next - the fth - step, the introduction of the gauge symmetry of rotator.
so far we have considered only symmetry u (1)a  u (1)z, because in sec. 3 and 7 we
have dealt with classical rotators, for which the transitions between the conguration
subspaces with 0
 = 1 cannot occur. in quantum theory such transitions are allowed
(by emission and absorption of w  bosons) and the denition of the rotator gauge
symmetry must be generalized correspondingly. to this aim we rst introduce the
generators of the weak isospin

t1 =

1
2

i,

t2 =

i
2

0


i,

t3 = 

1
2

0


(10.6)

where i is an inversion operator dened in the space of functions (10.3) as follows

i(0) = (0),

i+(i) = +(i)

one can easily show that

titk + tkti =

1
2

ik

(10.7)

to make the derivation of su (2)lu (1)y gauge symmetry more transparent, especially
to show that it has its roots in the axial symmetry of rotator, we start with the simplest
situation:

i) two neutral gauge elds a, z and one kind of rotator. in the classical case
we have seen in sec. 3 and 7 that the symmetry is u (1)a  u (1)z with the generators
1 and u + u0, where u = 3.s is the projection of spin to symmetry axis and u0 is
in quantum theory the second generator becomes iu + u0, where
some constant.
=  

 (see eq. (5.5))). since the projection of spin can assume only
u = 3.i = i
i
two values s,

3 = 1/2 it is useful to introduce new gauge symmetry generators

which are the projection operators to states with left-handed and right-handed chirality

pl,r =

1
2

 iu

(10.8)

where

pl+ =

1
2

+(1 + 5) = +l

+(1  5) = +r

5 =(cid:18) 1

0

0

1(cid:19)

the gauge elds belonging to generators pl and pr will be denoted as w3 and b,
respectively. the equations (6.3) in the explicit transcription read

s4p = 0,
23

s5p

(10.9)

the interaction corresponding to rotator mode is introduced by the replacement

p = i  i +

g
2

plw3 +

g,
2

prb

(10.10)

where g and g, are the coupling constants. the gauge symmetry is then u (1)l  u (1)r.
the relations to the original elds are given by the conventional rotation

w3 = cos w z + sin w a

b =  sin w z + cos w a

where cos w = g

g , sin w = g 

g , g =pg2 + g2. from (10.10) one obtains

i  i  ea +

(u0  iu )z

(10.11)

g
2

where e =  gg 

2g is the electric charge and u0 = 1

2 cos 2w .

ii) two neutral gauge elds and both kinds of rotators. if we for a while assume
that the two kinds of rotators have the opposite electric charge the generators of gauge
transformation have slightly dierent form: 0
 pr. instead of (10.10) we will have

 pl, 0

i  i +

g
2

0


plw3 +

g
2

0


prb

(10.12)

g and q =  0

and this replacement should be done in eq. (10.5). the electric charge is then eq, where
e = gg 
2 . in fact the charges of up type and down type fermions do not
dier in sign only. rather the charge of the whole doublet is shifted by amount q0, but
this can be without problems incorporated in our gauge symmetry pattern, since each
u (1) symmetry generator is xed up to an additive constant. taking into account that
0
1
 = t3 we see that the gauge symmetry contained in (10.12) is u (1)t3l  u (1)t3r.
2
this leads us to the nal situation with
iii) two neutral and two charged gauge elds as well as two kinds of rotators. from the
comparison with ewsm we conclude that the nal xation of gauge generators must
be the following

t3pl  tipl

0


pr(  0

 0

 pr + 1 = y, for leptons
 pr  1
3 = y, for quarks

(10.13)

(10.14)

the replacement (10.13) can be interpreted in our opinion as the generalization of the
rotator axial symmetry to the interaction with charged gauge elds, besides the neutral
ones. in fact the gauge symmetry has the group character and the only generalization
of u (1)t3 is su (2).

as for replacement (10.14) the problem is how to explain the values of additive
constants in y . but the same problem was encountered in ewsm, where it was solved

24

using the condition following from cancellation of triangular chiral gauge anomalies. in
particular one gets for y the condition

xleptons

y + xquarks

y = 0

(10.15)

sincep 0

 = 0 it follows from (10.14) that condition (10.15) is satised (4.13.4. 1

3 = 0).
taking the replacements (10.13) and (10.14) as at least intuitively justied we obtain

from (10.12)

i  i  gtiplwi 

g
2

y b

inserting this in (10.5) we get

s4
ext(i  gtiplwi 

s5
ext(i  gtiplwi 

g

g
2

y b)ext = 0

y b)ext = 0

(10.16)

(10.17)

to pass from dierential operators to dirac matrices we use the relations found in [7]

sab(i)+(i) = +(i)sab
matr

(10.18)

where

s
matr = 

(  )

the relations (10.18) naturally hold also for i  i, so that sab
ext can be expressed by
means of -matrices, too. note that -matrices do not provide room for the distinction
between up and down type fermions, while the dierential operators sab
ext such a room
do provide. from the expressions for s4
matr it follows that the equations
(10.16) and (10.17) are not independent, so we restrict ourselves to (10.17) only.

11. conclusions

the notion of at introduced in this paper plays a useful mediatory role in estab-
lishing the link between strings and the spin 1/2 particles. on one hand this notion
represents a suitable model of dirac particles in the sense that it allows only minimal
value of spin s = 1/2 for the particle. on the other hand at can be interpreted as a
string at low energies, when vibrational and rotational degrees of freedom are frozen.
at oers also some sort of reconciliation of two opposite interpretations of spin: one
as coming from the rotation of a rigid body and the other as a mere quantum eect.
according to the novel interpretation, spin is associated with the rigid body, but this
body is of aristotelian nature, so that a free particle does not rotate, although it has
spin.

the mediatory role of at has been exploited in the present paper for a derivation
of ewsm from the at dynamics. the starting point was a peculiar property of at
consisting in the fact that the rotator mode of at can be realized only through the gauge

26

interaction with a vectorial eld with the gauge group u (1). this group represents
the axial symmetry of the rotator, i.e. the symmetry under the rotations around the
rotator axis. the second fact relevant for the derivation of ewsm was the observation
that there are two kinds of rotators/tops. arguments based on the superselection rule
indicate that they can be interpreted as up - type and down - type fermions. in view of
two types of rotators intuitive arguments lead to the conclusion that in general the axial
symmetry of the rotator can be realized through the group su (2)  u (1) and for the
group su (2) one selects either singlet or doublet representation (the former for right -
handed, the latter for left - handed elds).

note some analogy with kaluza - klein interpretation of electromagnetic u (1) gauge
symmetry in 5d classical eld theory. the extra space dimension is compacited on a
circle, which possesses u (1) isometry and due to the general covariance this isometry is
converted into u (1) electromagnetic gauge symmetry. here the isometry of the circle
is replaced by the rotator axial symmetry and the locality of gauge transformation is a
consequence of spin 1/2 of the rotator (sec. 4).

if our representation of electroweak gauge symmetry is correct, then the spontaneous
violation of the symmetry must be associated with the bending of rotator under the
inuence of higgs eld and subsequent transformation of rotator to top. we have not
studied in more details the models for such a transformation, because it is a problem
per se, obviously related with the complicated issue of lepton and quark masses.

instead, the problem which must be studied next is the su (3) color gauge interaction
of quarks. if our basic philosophy is correct, at must include not only leptons, but
also quarks. consequently in mathematical description of at there must be a room,
which allows to introduce quarks as a new particular sort of at, in a similar way as
it has been done in case of two categories of fermions, the up - type and down - type
ones. preliminary search in this direction revealed an interesting possibility, namely the
innite dimensional representations of lorentz and so(3, 3) group. as stressed several
times before the spin of at must be 1/2 and following the conventional wisdom this
requirement alone leads to dirac equation and thus to nite dimensional representation
of lorentz group. but this conclusion is incorrect. actually, spin is associated with the
dimensionality of the representation of the rotational group so(3) in the rest system of
the particle. fixing the s = 1/2 option we have still the liberty to select either nite or
innite dimensional representation for the lorentz boost. choosing the latter possibility
we obtain a particle with properties in some respects dierent from those, which share
dirac particles. in progress is a study with the aim to nd out whether these properties
t quarks or not.

appendix a

for the sake of completeness we summarize here some kinematical denitions as
well as the denitions of so(3,3) group generators sab. we also present some useful
relations for sab. the body coordinate system of the rotator/top is dened by means

of unit vectors

1 = (cos  cos   sin  sin  cos , cos  sin  + sin  cos  cos , sin  sin )

2 = ( sin  cos   cos  sin  cos ,  sin  sin  + cos  cos  cos , cos  sin )

3 = (sin  sin ,  sin  cos , cos )

where , ,  are euler angles. a state of rotator/top is characterized by the canonically
conjugated variables i, i, where i are related to euler angles

and i to spin components

the generators sab = sba are dened as follows

(s23, s31, s12) = (s1, s2, s3)

(s01, s02, s03) = (n1, n2, n3)

the so(3, 3) lie algebra is given by the poisson brackets relations

where

g00 = g44 = g55 = 1,

g11 = g22 = g33 = 1,

gab = 0 for a 6= b.

the following relations are direct consequences of the corresponding denitions

appendix b

conventional conguration space of strings is a set of 3d curves given by the para-
metric equation x = x(), where  is the length along the string. by means of frenets
equations

(b1)

one can obtain two other conguration spaces. here t, n, b are tangent, normal and
binormal unit vectors, respectively, k(), () are the curvature and the torsion of the
string. thus a curve can be equivalently characterized by (k(), (), t(0), n(0), b(0),
x), where x is the position vector of one of the two end - points of the string. solving
the eq. (b1) one obtains another description of the curve: (t(), n(), b(), x). if one
identies t = 3, n = 1, b = 2, then a straight line given by k() = 0, () = 0
corresponds to a rotator. it is well known that in this case the unit vectors n, b can
be chosen arbitrarily in a plane orthogonal to t. this freedom corresponds just to the
axial symmetry group u (1) of the rotator.

in quantum theory we expect that the state of a string (at least in a simplied

nonrelativistic version) is characterized by the wave functions

s = s[1(), 2(), 3(), x]
s = s[k(), (), 1(0), 2(0), 3(0), x]

or

in case of a frozen string k(), () do not depend on time and ceased to be real degrees
of freedom. then the wave function reduces to

s = s[1(0), 2(0), 3(0), x] = (i, x) ,

which is the wave function considered in this paper. we have seen that (i, x) can
describe spin 1/2 particle, so we expect that also in general situation corresponding to
s, half - integral spin is allowed.
