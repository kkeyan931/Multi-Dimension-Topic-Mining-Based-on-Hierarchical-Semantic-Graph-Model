abstract

we obtain local parametrizations of classical non-compact lie groups where ad-
joint invariants under maximal compact subgroups are manifest. extension to non
compact subgroups is straightforward. as a by-product parametrizations of the
same type are obtained for compact groups. they are of physical interest in any
theory gauge invariant under the adjoint action, typical examples being the two
dimensional gauged wess-zumino-witten-novikov models where these coordinati-
zations become of extreme usefulness to get the background elds representing the
vacuum expectation values of the massless modes of the associated (super) string
theory.

1 introduction

it is none to say what group theory meant (and means) for theoretical physics during this
century, in particular the theory of continuous groups or lie groups ( see e.g. [1], [2] and
references therein). the properties of their lie algebras, easier to hand than the groups
themselves, dene them locally and in fact most part of the textbooks are dedicated to
them [3]. however depending on the problem at hand, explicit parametrizations of the
group manifold become necessary. many of them are widely known, example of them the
su(2) or more generally the euler angles of orthogonal groups. of course that we can
always write locally a group element as a product of one-generator exponentials, or simply
as the exponential of an arbitrary lie algebra element. but in most cases theses obvious

parametrizations are of few usefulness because they obscure the global properties of the
group and generally lead to un-tractable computations.

an interesting parametrization is suggested by the mackey theorem, the well-known

coset decomposition: let g be a group and h a subgroup of it. then for any g  g,

g = k h, k  g/h , h  h

(1.1)

in a unique way. this leads to the theory of homogeneous spaces (or (left or right) coset
spaces) g/h, good references on the subject being [4], [5]. among others physical appli-
cations (1.1) is fundamental in the treatment of eective eld theories with spontaneously
broken symmetries [6].

but let us assume instead that we have a eld theory including maps from space-
time on a group manifold g among its degrees of freedom, and gauge invariant under
the adjoint action of a subgroup h of g

g  hg = h g h1 , h  h

(1.2)

this means that eectively the theory depends on the invariants of the group under the
adjoint action of the subgroup. that is, if we were able to write uniquely any element of
g as

g  h1 g h , h  h

(1.3)

then clearly making a gauge transformation (1.2) identifying the hs the theory will depend
only on g that encloses the invariants mentioned above. we would like to remark that at
dierence of (1.1) there no exists any general theorem assuring the decomposition (1.3);
in fact it is not dicult to nd examples where it is not possible to write it.

it is the aim of this paper to get the class of local parametrizations of the type (1.3)
in a whole set of cases of physical interest. specic examples where they must be used
(and were used in the lower dimensionality cases where parametrizations were available)
are the two dimensional gauged wess-zumino-witten-novikov models [7], [8]. it is worth
to say however that the results, being explicit parametrizations of classical groups, are
valuable on their own right independently of the applications.

2 the orthogonal groups

we consider in this section the pseudo-orthogonal groups, g  so(p, q). its maximal
compact subgroup is h  so(p)  so(q). in order to get its decomposition (1.3) we
need as a rst step to get the

2.1 reduction of so(p + 1) under so(p).

we start by writing [5]

pp+1(~up, pp) = kp(~up) h(pp, 1)

(2.1)

2

where ~up is a p-dimensional real vector, pp  so(p) and generically we will mean

h(p, q) =   p 0
0 q !

(2.2)

in what follows the dimensionalities of matrices should be understood from the context
when not stated explicitly. the right coset element in so(p + 1)/so(p)  s p is given by

kp+1(~up) = (cid:18) 1  (1 + up+1)1 ~up~up

t

1 = ~up

~up
t~up + (up+1)2

t

~up

up+1(cid:19)

under an adjoint transformation

hpp+1 = h(h, 1) pp+1 h(ht, 1) , h  so(p)

the parameters of pp+1 get transformed as:

h~up = h ~up
hpp = h pp ht

(2.3)

(2.4)

(2.5)

the procedure will be constructive. les us pick an arbitrary matrix vp  so(p)
decomposed this time as a left coset w.r.t. so(p  1)

and rewrite (2.1) for any such a vp with the help of (2.5) as

vp = h(vp1, 1) kp(~vp1)

t, 1) pp+1 h(vp, 1)
pp+1 = h(vp
pp+1 = kp+1(vp~up) h(vpppvp

t, 1)

(2.6)

(2.7)

the general idea to apply here and in the subsequent cases is to x the whole matrix vp
( ~vp1, vp1 ) in terms of variables of pp+1 ( ~up, pp), leaving aside only precisely the
invariants together with the matrix vp as parameters of pp+1. evidently this procedure
is equivalent to make a change of variables from the non-invariant parameters in pp+1 to
vp.

equation (2.7) suggests to put ~up

in some standard form by a specic choice of (a

part of) vp. in fact it is easy to show that the choice 2

denes the rotation

  ~vp1
vp ! = 

~up
|~up|

kp(~vp1) ~up = |~up| ep

(2.8)

(2.9)

2 as usual we will use the notation (ei)j = ij , (eij)kl = ikjl, aij  eij  eji, sij  eij + eji.

3

note that we have changed the (p1) parameters from ~up indicating its direction in terms
of the (p  1) parameters in ~vp1. with such a choice of ~vp1 (vp1 not xed yet) we can
write

pp+1 = kp+1(|~up| ep) h(h(vp1, 1) pp h(vp1, 1)t, 1)

(2.10)

where we have redened pp  kp(~vp1)t pp kp(~vp1). but according to (2.7) we can
rewrite it as

pp+1 = kp+1(|~up| ep) h( pp, 1)

(2.11)

inspection of this formula indicates an iterative process, the next step being to write the
analogous expression for pp and so on; after p steps we get

pp+1 =

p
yl=1

h (kl+1(|~ul|el), 1pl)

it is convenient to introduce the angular variables

and write the so(p + 1) element in the nal form

|~ul| = sin l

, 0  l  

(2.12)

(2.13)

pp+1 = h(vp, 1)t pp+1 h(vp, 1)

pp+1 =

exp (l al,l+1)

(2.14)

p
yl=1

which displays explicitly the p invariants {l, l = 1,    , p} under the adjoint action of
so(p). note that the number of parameters trivially matches: p
2 (p + 1),
as should; this is the rst of our results, to be used in the following.

2(p  1) + p = p

2.2 reduction of so(p, q) under so(p)  so(q).

our starting point is again the right coset parametrization [5] 3

p,q(s, pp, qq) = kp,q(s) h(pp, qq)

(2.15)

where pp(qq)  (so(p)(so(q)) and the coset element is given by

kp,q(s) = exp  0 n

with hp(hq)  so(p)(so(q)), the parameters of p,q transforms as

t

hs = hp s hq
hpp = hp pp ht
p
hqq = hq qq ht
q

(2.18)

by following the strategy pursued in the past subsection we introduce two matrices vp, vq
belonging to so(p), so(q) respectively and rewrite (2.15)

p,q = h(vp, vq)t p,q h(vp, vq)
p,q = exp

as in (2.6) we consider left coset parametrizations

vp = h(vp1, 1) kp(~vp1)
vq = h(vq1, 1) kq(~vq1)

(2.20)

and try to totally x ~vp1 and ~vq1 to put n in a standard form. it turns out that it
is possible to choose these vectors in such a way that

vp n vq

t  h(vp1, 1)kp(~vp1) nkq(~vq1)t h(vq1

t, 1) =   nr 0
0 n !

where nr  (p1)(q1) and n   . in fact if we write

n =   n 

r
~nq1

t

~np1

n !

(2.21)

(2.22)

then is straightforward to verify that the gauge xing condition ~np1 = ~nq1 = ~0, i.e.

holds if we choose

kp(~vp1) nkq(~vq1)t =   nr 0
n !

with ~tp1,~tq1 satisfying 4

~tp1 = (~nq1

4 this set of equations can be reduced to a system of two (quadratic) equations with two unknowns;

t~tq1  n)1 (cid:16)~np1  n 

r

~tq1(cid:17)

the important thing for us is that solutions exist and dene the change of variables

~tq1 = (~np1

t~tp1  n)1(cid:16)~nq1  n 

r

t~tp1(cid:17)

(2.25)

t nr vq1

leads to (2.21). finally (after reparametrizing
a nal redenition nr  vp1
pp  kp(~vp1)t pp kp(~vp1) , qq  kq(~vq1)t qq kq(~vq1) ) we use (2.14) to x vp1
and vq1; the result can be recast in the form
p,q = h(vp, vq)t p,q h(vp, vq)
p,q = exp


nij si,p+j + nsp,p+q


exp(kap+k,p+k+1)

exp(kak,k+1)


p  1


q  1

again we verify the matching in the number of parameters vp, vq, nij, n, k, k ,

(p + q)(p + q  1) (2.27)

it is worth to say that the rst term in (2.26) can be computed as in (2.16) with n as in
the r.h.s. of (2.21); however this is a formal expression for which, to our knowledge, only
the minkowskian cases p = 1 or q = 1 admit an explicit form.

3 the unitary groups

the treatment of these groups parallels that made in the case of the orthogonal ones,
with some additional complications due to the complex character of them. as before we
start considering

3.1 reduction of su (p + 1) under u (p).

an element of su(p + 1) can be written as

pp+1(~up, up) = kp+1(~up) h(up, u

p) = kp+1(~up) h(pp, 1) exp (i ptp)

(3.1)

where up  det up = exp(ipp) , ~up  cp , up  u(p), pp  su(p) , and we have
l=1(ell  ek+1,k+1), k = 1,    , p} in the cartan
subalgebra of su(p + 1). the right coset element in (3.1) belonging to su(p + 1)/u(p) 
cp p is given by [5]

introduced a convenient basis {tk = pk

kp+1(~up) =   1  (1 + u2p+1)1 ~up~up





~up

u2p+1 !

~up
~up + (u2p+1)2

1 = ~up

the adjoint action under hp  u(p) is ( hp  det hp)

hpp+1 = h(hp, h

p) pp+1 h(hp, h

p)  


6

(3.2)

(3.3)

v ~up = hp hp ~up
hpp = hp pp h 
p
hp = p

as before we pick an arbitrary vp  u(p) left coset parametrized

vp = h(vp1, v

p1) kp(~vp1) exp(ip)

, vp1  u(p  1)

(3.4)

and write (3.1) with the help of (3.3) as

p) pp+1 h(vp, vp
pp+1 = h(vp, v
pp+1 = kp+1(vpvp~up) h(vpppvp

)
, 1) exp(i ptp)

by choosing ~vp1 and p (vp1 free) as

  ~vp1
v2p1 ! = 
exp(ip) =   (~u

(~u

|(~up)p|
p)p

|(~up)p|!

~up
|~up|

1

p+1

we have

vp vp ~up = |~up| ep

(3.5)

(3.6)

(3.7)

and identifying vp1 as the su(p  1) matrix corresponding to the pp decomposition in
(3.5) ( previous redenition pp  kp (~vp1)pp kp(~vp1) ) we get

pp+1 = kp+1(|~up|ep) h( pp, 1) exp(i ptp)

by repeating the analysis for pp and after p steps we arrive to the nal result

(3.8)

(3.9)

pp+1 = h(vp, v

pp+1 =

l=1 ltl) at right in pp+1.
cartan element cp+1() = exp(ipp

exp (l al,l+1) cp+1()

it diers from (2.14) from the unitary character of vp and the comparison of the arbitrary

3.2 reduction of su (p, q) under s(u (p)  u (q)).

in order not to be repetitive we will skip some steps in what follows. an arbitrary element
in su(p, q) can be left coset decomposed under s(u(p)  u(q)) as

p,q(s, up, uq) = kp,q(s) h(up, uq)

kp,q(s) =   (1 + ss)

the adjoint action under h(hp, hq)  s(u(p)  u(q)) is

h p,q = h(hp, hq) p,qh(hp, hq)

hs = hp s hq
h up = hp up h

h uq = hq uq hq

(3.11)

two matrices vp, vq belonging to u(p), u(q) respectively with vpvq = 1 are introduced
and following similar steps as in subsection 2.2 we nd that it is possible to x n in the
way

n =   nr 0
0 n !

(3.12)

where now nr  c(p1)(q1) and n  . then by using the results of the past subsection
we get the nal result for the parametrization

p,q = h(vp, vq) p,q h(vp, vq)
p,q = exp  0 n

where h(vp, vq)  s(u(p)  u(q)) and we denote by c() an arbitrary element in the
cartan subalgebra of the lie algebra of s(u(p)  u(q)).

3.3 decomposition under the maximal torus

some times is useful to have the adjoint decomposition of unitary groups under the cartan
subalgebra. we will work out for deniteness the case of su(n + 1); the non compact
versions dier as usual by signs in the coset elements and wick rotations of some compact
generators.

to this end we begin by searching for the coset decomposition of su(n + 1) under

c(su(n + 1)); from (3.1)

pn+1(~un, un) = kn+1(~un) h(un, u
n)
rn

kn+1(~un) = exp n  0

rn = 1 , n  [0, ]

(3.14)

by introducing

un = pn   1n1

0

0

un ! , pn  su(n)

un  det un = exp(in)

(3.15)

we can rewrite (3.14) as

pn+1(~un, un) = kn+1(~un) h(pn, 1) exp(i nhn)

(3.16)

where this time is convenient to introduce the basis {hk = ekk  ek+1,k+1, k = 1,    , n}
in the cartan subalgebra of su(n + 1). by repeating with pn and iterating we get

pn+1 =

n

yl=1   kl+1(~ul)

0

8

0

1nl ! exp(i ~  ~h)

(3.17)

now let us pick an element cn+1(~)  exp(ihi)  c(su(n + 1)) and write as usual

pn+1 = cn+1(~)

n

yl=1 cn+1(~)   kl+1(~ul)

0

0

1nl ! cn+1(~)! cn+1(~) cn+1(~)

(3.18)

we see that the (l) variables are invariant; we must choose the is to kill parameters in
the productory. it is easy to show that the versors rl get transformed as

rl = exp(il+1) exp(i

l

xi=1

ieii) rn

,

l = 1,    , n

(3.19)

where

1
k1 + k
n

if k = 1
if k = 2, . . . , n
if k = n + 1

(3.20)

k = 


then we can put the phases of the (rl)l components, l = 1,    , n, to zero by choosing
the s such that 5

21  2 = phase(r1)1
1 + 22  3 = phase(r2)2

...

...

in other words, from (3.18) we get the nal result

n1 + 2n = phase(rn)n

(3.21)

pn+1 = cn+1(~) pn+1 cn+1(~)

pn+1 =

with the constraints implied by (3.21): (rl)l   , l = 1, . . . , n.

4 the decomposition of sl(n) under su (n).

this is one of the two irreducible riemannian cases 6 in the sense that the coset element is

not of the form exp  0

0 ! for some matrix n (o-diagonal cosets). we start from

the well-known coset decomposition under so(n) of any unimodular real n  n matrix

gn = sn pn , sn

t = sn

, pn  so(n)

(4.1)

5equations (3.21) can be formally solved by i = k 1i

j phase(rj)j where k is the killing-cartan
matrix of the an algebra; it is probable that this fact does not be an accident but occurs in other cases
g/c(g).

6 the other one is su (2n)/u sp(2n) and will not be considered here.

9

also sn is positive denite and det sn = 1. but we know from elementary linear algebra
that any such a matrix is diagonalizable by an orthogonal one qn completely determined

sn = qn

where cn  c(su(n, c)) and the vectors ~ul are constrained by (rl)l   as in section
3.3.

5 conclusions

we have obtained in this paper adjoint parametrizations dened by (1.3) w.r.t. maximally
compact subgroups for a large set of non-compact groups, the classically riemannian
cosets. the constructive procedure used allows to extend them straightforwardly to non
riemannian decompositions, for example so(p+n, q) under so(n, q) . few words about
symplectic groups: these groups can be treated in the same way as made here; the fact

that usp(2p, 2q)  u(2p, 2q; c)t sp(2p+2q; c) seems to suggest that the corresponding

decomposition under usp(2p)  usp(2q) could follow from replacing in (3.13) e by z
generators 7 and respective cartan subalgebras, but we have not checked this.

we remark the locality of the parametrizations obtained; the changes of variables
needed to carry out the job are singular in some points of the group manifold as can be
seen by direct inspection of (2.8) , (3.6) for example.

possible applications in physical problems of these parametrizations are in the context
of gwzw models as models of strings moving on background elds. equation (2.26)
can be used to treat systematically all the models in [9] where the lowest dimensional
cases were considered. also the measure on the group can be computed straightforwardly
through the maurer-cartan forms without introducing fadeed-popov ghost due to con-
straints because they were solved once for all. for p+q = 2 (a1 algebras) parametrization
(3.13) is widely known; for p = 2, q = 1 was introduced in [10]; it allows to extend the
study of coset models in the search of physically relevant string backgrounds represented
by exact conformal eld theories.
