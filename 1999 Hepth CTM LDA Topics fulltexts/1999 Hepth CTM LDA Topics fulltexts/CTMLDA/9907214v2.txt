abstract

we consider the n = 2 supersymmetric born-infeld action and compute one-
loop divergences quantizing the theory in n = 1 superspace. we nd that in
the presence of non constant curvature the theory is not renormalizable. the
structure of the ()4 counterterm, proportional to derivatives of the curvature,
is consistent with eective action calculations from superstring theory.

a nonlinear generalization of maxwell theory is given by the born-infeld action [1]

sbi =

1

2 z d4x(cid:26)1 qdet( +  f)(cid:27)

(1)

where we have dened   2 and have chosen a at euclidean metric g = . the
action in (1) describes the self-interaction of electromagnetic elds of arbitrary degree
in the curvature tensor f.
it has the remarkable property of reproducing the eec-
tive action from open bosonic strings in a background abelian gauge eld with constant
curvature [2, 3].

given the fact that the born-infeld action contains terms of arbitrary order in the eld-
strength, a question that naturally arises is related to its renormalizability properties: is
the theory nite, renormalizable or at least renormalizable for constant curvature? in the
following we address these issues for the supersymmetric version of the theory, computing
in superspace at the one-loop level.

the n = 1 supersymmetrization of the action in (1) has been obtained in ref.

[4],
while the extension to the n = 2 supersymmetric case has been presented in [5]. we
focus on the n = 2 version of the theory:
it can be obtained by a partial breaking of
n = 4 supersymmetry and therefore it is consistent with the eective d3-brane action
[6] in the type iib superstring theory.

we introduce the n = 2 supereld-strength w satisfying the constraints

d iw = 0

d4w = w

with i = 1, 2. the n = 2 superspace invariant action can be written as [5]

ssbi =

1

2 z d4xd4 w 2 +

1

8 z d4xd4d4 y(k, k) 2 w 2w 2

(2)

(3)

where d4  d21d22. the function y(k, k) dened in terms of k = d4w 2 is given
explicitly by

y(k, k) =

1  2

4 (k + k)]2  4

= 1 +

(k + k) + o(4)

(4)

since we are interested in performing quantum calculations we rewrite the action in
(3) in n = 1 superspace: there one can use the standard quantization procedure for

1

n = 1 superelds. to this end we decompose the n = 2 supereld-strength w in terms
of its n = 1 supereld components

w =  +

dv is the n = 1 chiral eld-strength with v the unconstrained vector
where w = id
supereld, and  is the n = 1 matter supereld. in this manner the kinetic part of the
action in (3) becomes (we dene 1 = , 1  =   )

skin =

the next contribution is given by the quartic interaction term w 2w

to the action are

the other interactions from the expansion of y(k, k) can be worked out straightfor-
wardly, but the terms in (8) are sucient for the determination of the one-loop countert-
erm. the gauge-xing for the vector supereld action is standard (see for example [7]).
we work in feynman gauge and use the following propagators

< v (x, )v (x, ) >=

1


(4)(x  x)(4)(  )

< (x, ) (x, ) >= 

1


(4)(x  x)(4)(  )

(9)

the vertices are obtained from (8) with extra d
(antichiral ) line leaving a vertex.

2 (d2) factors acting on each chiral 

we are interested in the computation of o(4) on-shell one-loop divergent contri-
butions to the eective action and in particular we look for terms with external vector
eld-strengths. once we have determined the structure of these counterterms, n = 2
supersymmetry will allow us to reconstruct the complete answer. setting the external
background on-shell means that we can freely use the equations of motion

dw = 0



d

w  = 0

which imply

d2w = ddw = 0

w  = 0

(10)

(11)

from the interaction terms in (8) we see that the relevant one-loop supergraphs are
the ones with four external eld-strengths and quantum propagators given by matter
chiral superelds and by vector superelds. using standard d-algebra techniques one
shows that all the graphs which contain chiral superelds lead to tadpole-type momentum
integrals. their contribution is set to zero in dimensional regularization scheme. various
dierent diagrams can be drawn with vector internal lines: most of them are immediately
discarded either because they trivially vanish after completion of the d-algebra or they
again reduce to tadpole-type integrals or else are zero by momentum integration. the
only non vanishing contributions correspond to the supergraphs shown in g. 1 and 2
which we call g1 and g2 respectively in the following.

first we analyze the contribution to the eective action from g1. after d-algebra we

obtain

in order to streamline the notation we write w 2(1, 2)  1

w,1  w(p1) etc. sometimes, whenever clear from the context, we simply drop the
momentum suxes.

it is useful to rewrite the result in (14) taking advantage of various on-shell identities.

we list the ones that we repeatedly use

now we turn to the corresponding calculation for the supergraph in g. 2.

after completion of the d-algebra the g2 diagram in g. 2 gives rise to the following

to a divergence which in dimensional regularization is given by

now we impose the on-shell equations (10,11,15) on the external background. in addition
we use the following relations

w ,3) = (p1 + p3) (dw,1)(d



w ,3) = 0

also for two spinors ,  we can write

(42)

it is interesting to note that terms like the one in eq. (42) have been obtained in the
past from the study of scattering amplitudes of vector elds in type iib string theory on
the d3-brane [8] and in type i open string theory [9, 10, 11]. indeed the result obtained
from string theory is of the form (cfr. [8])

(s)(t)

(1 + s + t)

k((i), p(j))

(43)

where (i) are the four polarization vectors and p(j) are the four external momenta. k

is a kinematic factor corresponding to the term hf 4  1

factor is completely symmetric in the external momenta. expanding the -functions in
eq. (43) and symmetrizing with respect to the momenta we obtain a term proportional
to

4(f 2)2i. as mentioned above this

(s2 + t2 + u2)(cid:20)f 4 

1
4

(f 2)2(cid:21) ,

(44)

i.e. of the same form as in (42).

the result in (42) gives the o(4) counterterm of the bosonic born-infeld action.
on dimensional grounds it is easy to determine the general structure of the allowed

10

counterterms at any order. taking into account the mass dimensions of the various
factors

d4x  m4

  m2

  m

f  m2

(45)

and keeping in mind that divergences correspond to local expressions, we have that the
structure of the counterterms at l-loop order can be written symbolically as

1

2 z d4x (24)l(f )2n

n > 1

(46)

it is clear that in the presence of constant curvature f no divergent correction arises. on
the contrary, whenever f is not negligible divergences might appear at any loops and
to all orders in the elds. the number of derivatives is xed 4l at l loops, while any
number of elds can be produced since f is of mass dimensions zero.

in the same way one can repeat this analysis for the supersymmetric theory. it would
be quite interesting to perform higher order computations explicitly and determine the
counterterms exactly.

in a recent paper [12] similar issues have been addressed and one-loop corrections have

been computed for the d3 brane action.
