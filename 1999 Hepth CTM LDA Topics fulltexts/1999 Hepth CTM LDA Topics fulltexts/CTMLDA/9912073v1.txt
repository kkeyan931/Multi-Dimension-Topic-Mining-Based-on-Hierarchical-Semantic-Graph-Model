abstract

we calculate the classical cross-section for absorption of a minimally coupled
scalar in the double-centered d3-brane geometry. the dual eld theory has gauge
symmetry broken to s(u (n1)  u (n2)) and is on the coulomb branch of n = 4
super yang-mills theory. our analysis is valid at energy scales much smaller than
the w particles mass, giving logarithmic corrections to the cross section calculated
at the ir conformal xed points. these corrections are associated with deformations
of the n = 4 super yang-mills theory by irrelevant operators that break conformal
invariance and correspond to processes where a virtual pair of gauge particles or a
virtual pair of w bosons interact with the incident wave to create a pair of gauge
particles.

1 introduction

the famous ads/cft duality [1, 2, 3] has been investigated intensively over the past two
years (see [4] for a review and an exhaustive list of references). the most studied case is the
conjectured equivalence between type iib string theory on ads5  s5 and the low energy
theory on n d3-branes given by n = 4 super yang-mills (sym) theory with su(n) gauge
group. unfortunately, due to our limited knowledge of ramond-ramond backgrounds in
string theory, we are bound to consider type iib supergravity on ads5  s5, which is dual
to large n sym theory at strong coupling.

the moduli space of su(n) n = 4 sym theory is r6(n1)/sn , parameterizing the
relative position of n identical d3-branes in the transverse space e6. at the origin of the
moduli space the theory is superconformally invariant. this fact is related to symmetry
enhancement at the d3-brane near-horizon geometry [5] and it guarantees that both the-
ories are invariant under the p su(2, 2|4) supergroup. however, many interesting theories
like qcd are not conformally invariant. the main purpose of this paper is to study the
ads/cft duality when conformal invariance is broken by separating the d3-branes. in
particular, we consider the case of two parallel stacks of d3-branes. in the dual eld the-
ory, moving away from the origin of the moduli space means that the scalar elds have
non-zero expectation values. this is also known as the coulomb branch of the theory.
the dual gravitational conguration is related to the double-centered type iib d3-brane
background. previous work on the coulomb branch of the correspondence can be found
in [6  17]. other studies of the duality with broken conformal invariance are [18  27].
consider n = n1 + n2 d3-branes described at low energies by the su(n) n = 4
sym theory. next, higgs the system by giving an expectation value to the scalar elds
according to

(1.1)

where ii is the ni  ni unit matrix. the n1 and n2 d3-branes are separated by a distance
2 and the gauge symmetry is broken to s(u(n1)  u(n2)). furthermore, the theory is
no longer conformally invariant and there is a scale naturally set by the w boson mass
that arises from the symmetry breaking process:

mw =




.

(1.2)

the theory is still maximally supersymmetric, i.e. it has 16 conserved supercharges (but it
is not invariant under the extra 16 superconformal charges). hence, we shall be interested
in maximally supersymmetric rg ows [24]. in the uv, for energies   mw , we recover

2

the conformal invariant su(n) theory, while for   mw the theory ows to the ir
conformal xed points with su(ni) gauge symmetry. in particular, the gauge coupling
beta function vanishes along such ows and the theory can be described starting from a
ir xed point by a deformation given by a non-renormalizable, irrelevant operator with
scaling dimension 8, as was conjectured in [18, 19, 24].

we shall be able to test the above conjecture by studying the low energy scattering
of the dilaton eld (or more generally of a minimally coupled scalar) in the dual double-
centered d3-brane geometry. to be more precise, we nd logarithmic corrections to the
cross-section calculated at the ir conformal xed points. these corrections are associated
with processes where a pair of gauge particles is created via the interaction of the incident
dilaton wave with a virtual pair of gauge particles or a virtual pair of w bosons. hence,
even at energies   mw , well below the threshold for w boson pair production, the dual
gravity theory knows about the w particles. this result provides further evidence for the
duality to hold even when conformal invariance is broken, as is the case in the coulomb
branch of the eld theory away from the origin of the moduli space of vacua.

the paper is organized as follows: in section 2 we introduce the prolate spherical co-
ordinates, which are very useful to solve scattering problems in a double-centered black
hole background [28]. then, we analyze the double-centered d3-brane geometry in the
decoupling limit.
in section 3 we calculate the classical cross-section for absorption of
a minimally coupled scalar in the double-centered d3-brane background by using an im-
proved matching technique developed in [18]. these results are interpreted from the dual
eld theory point of view in section 4. finally, we give some concluding remarks in section
5.

2 prolate spherical coordinates and decoupling limit

in this section we analyze the double-centered d3-brane geometry and the correspond-
ing decoupling limit using prolate spherical coordinates [28]. the d3-brane geometry is
described by the metric

ds2 = h1/2ds2(m4) + h 1/2ds2(e6) .

in the double-centered case the harmonic function h is given by

h = 1 +

r 4

|~y  ~|4

r 4

|~y + ~|4

,

(2.1)

(2.2)

where ~y are the coordinates in the space orthogonal to the branes e6 and

r 4

i = 42gsni .

(2.3)

this solution is associated with a system of n1 d3-branes placed at ~ and n2 d3-branes
at ~.

next, we place the branes along the y6 axis and change to prolate spherical coordinates

y6 = r cos 1   cosh  cos  ,
 = r sin 1   sinh  sin  ,

(2.4)

where (r, 1, 2, ..., 5) are the usual spherical coordinates and (, , 2, ..., 5) are the prolate
spherical coordinates. of course, the system has so(5) invariance and the transformation
(r, 1)  (, ) is given by

r2  2(cid:16)cosh2  cos2  + sinh2  sin2 (cid:17) ,

tan 1  tanh  tan  .

it is convenient to dene the (, ) coordinates by

 = cosh  ,  = cos  ,

(2.5)

(2.6)

with  ]1, +[ and   [1, 1]. for   1, we have   r and   1, i.e. the spherical
coordinates are recovered. the coordinate system is singular at  = 1 (and  arbitrary).
in prolate spherical coordinates the harmonic function h becomes

h = 1 +

(2.7)

(2.8)

in the limit   1 we have the asymptotics of the n = n1 + n2 charged d3-brane solution.
we proceed by analyzing the geometry down the throats. consider the limit   1 and
  1 (or 1). this corresponds to the geometry near the horizon of the rst (second)
stack of n1 (n2) branes. it is convenient to perform the following change of coordinates

 = 1 + a ,  = 1  b .

(2.9)

next, dene the radial coordinate from the center of the i-th throat i and the angle with
the  = 1 direction i by

.

(2.10)

i = a + b ,

cos i =

to leading order in a and b (i.e. i) the spacetime metric reads

(2.11)

(2.12)

note that here and henceforth we have i 6= j. of course, for i  1 far down the throat
the constant terms in the harmonic function h become irrelevant. then, the geometry
becomes the well known ads5  s5 space with radius ri.

to analyze the geometry in the decoupling limit, rst consider the double-centered d3-
brane solution. this is an asymptotically at space with total charge n = n1 + n2 and
with two throats centered at ~ (see gure 1(a)). in the previous paragraph we saw that
the throat geometries are spherically symmetric and that far down the throats we obtain
the ads5  s5 single-centered black hole near-horizon geometry. the decoupling limit is
dened by sending   0 such that

~u

(2.13)

are kept xed, as well as the dimensionless parameters gs and ni (we require gs  1 and
gsni  1 for the supergravity approximation to hold). the spacetime metric becomes

ds2(e6) ,

(2.14)

where ds2(e6) is given by (2.8) with 2 replaced by d2. as we take the decoupling limit
the throats separation goes to zero and we have ri   (see gure 1(b)). in the limit
we obtain the tree-like geometry sketched in gure 1(c) [29]. this geometry is dual to
the coulomb branch of n = 4 sym theory as described in the introduction. in the limit
  1, the geometry approaches ads5  s5 near its boundary with radius r = r1 + r2.
this corresponds to the conformal uv limit of the su(n) eld theory. in the other limits
  1,   1 we obtain the ads5  s5 geometry with radius ri. in the eld theory
side these correspond to the su(ni) ir conformal xed points. at low energies   mw ,
we can start from the ir theory and consider some deformation of the eld theory. this
means that the geometry (2.14) is described by the throat metric (2.11) with the harmonic
function h given by

xed, while the case (a)(d)(e) to keeping  nite.

the constant term is due to the other throat and will be interpreted in the eld theory
side as a result of integrating out the massive w bosons.

a dierent possibility is to take the decoupling limit (2.13) with  nite and non-zero.
this means that ri   and that in the limit we have /  . in this case, as we take
the decoupling limit both throats are kept apart (gure 1(d)) and in the limit we obtain
two disconnected ads5  s5 spaces (gure 1(e)). in the low energy limit   mw , we shall
study the eects in the eld theory dual that correspond to connecting the two throats to
asymptotically at space as described by gure 1(d).

3 scattering of minimally coupled scalar

in this section we shall consider the problem of scattering a minimally coupled scalar in
the double-centered d3-brane background. we assume that the incident wave is isotropic
with frequency , i.e.

(3.1)

(3.3)

to solve this equation we use the by now well known matching technique. start by splitting
spacetime in the following four regions: near-horizon regions ii for   1 and   1;
intermediate region ii for  = 0; far region iii for   1. the dierent regions are shown
in gure 2. the dierential equation (3.2) becomes in each region

(3.6)

notice that the dierential equation (3.2) separates in the four regions.
in region iii
we assumed that the dilaton wave is constant along s5 because we consider a spherically
symmetric incident wave. also, in the throat regions ii we assume spherical symmetry,

7

i.e. there is no i dependence. the reason is that the higher harmonic dependence in i
is related to higher partial waves absorption by each hole whose cross-section is smaller
by a factor of (ri)4 in comparison to the leading order term here calculated. the use of
the  = 0 equation in region ii means that we are scattering the black holes at very low
energy. in particular, it means that   1, i.e. the wave length of the incident wave is
much larger than the holes separation distance.

first consider the throat regions ii. dening the coordinate zi = r 2

and setting

ii(zi) = z 4

i  (ri)4 (1 + (rj/2)4) this can be solved in terms of bessel functions of order

for z 2
2. the result is

ii(zi) = z 2

i (cid:16)aij2 (zi) + ibin2(zi)(cid:17) ,

(3.8)

where ai and bi are undetermined constants. in the uxes method for the absorption cross-
section calculation we require purely infalling ux at the horizons. setting ai = bi = 1
the ingoing ux at the horizons is fin(hi) = (r 2
i )4/. notice that the validity of the
i  (ri)4 (1 + (rj/2)4). it is not
approximation in regions ii requires i  1 and z 2
dicult to see that these conditions are compatible. to match this solution to the region
ii we require zi  1 and use the small argument expansion for the bessel functions.
consistency with the above conditions requires

(ri)4 1 +(cid:18) rj
2(cid:19)

4!  1 and

r 2

(3.9)

as usual we have (ri)  1 and the condition rirj/  1 holds for /mw  1. 2 in
the limit zi  1, (3.8) becomes

(3.10)

ii

.

in region ii, the solution to the dierential equation (3.5) can be written in terms of

the gegenbauer polynomials g2

l as

ii(, ) =

cl g2

l () g2

l () .

(3.11)

2to be more precise, the condition rirj/  1 is equivalent to   mg, where mg = mw /gn is the
gravity mass gap. hence, the domain of validity of this calculation is restricted to energies   mg  mw .
we shall comment on a possible eld theory interpretation of this fact later.

however, to match to the asymptotic behavior (3.10), only the constant term survives

ii = c = 

4i


.

(3.12)

finally, consider the asymptotic at region iii. dening the coordinate  =  the

corresponding dierential equation becomes

# iii() = 0 .

(3.13)

for 2  (ri)4 the last term is negligible and again this equation can be solved in terms
of bessel functions of order 2. the result is

iii() =

1

2 (cid:16)dj2 () + ien2()(cid:17) ,

(3.14)

where d and e are undetermined constants. the validity of the approximation in region
iii requires   1 and 2  (ri)4. these conditions are compatible because we are
assuming that (r 2
i /)  1. as usual, in the limit (ri)  1 we can set   1 and use
the small argument expansion of the bessel functions to match the solution to region ii.
notice that the condition   1 is compatible with  =   1 because  is small. in
the limit   1, (3.14) becomes

d

,

= 

(3.15)

where we matched the solution to ii. then, the incoming ux at innity is seen to be
fin() = (16)2/(34).

the probability for absorption by the i-th hole can be calculated as the ratio of the

incoming ux at the i-th horizon to the incoming ux at innity:

pi = fin(hi)
fin()

=

2
(16)2 (ri)8 ,

(3.16)

which is the same result as rst obtained by klebanov in the single-centered case [30]. the
absorption cross-section is related to this probability by abs = (322/5)p.

3.1 logarithmic corrections to absorption cross-section

the above calculation provides the leading term in an expansion of the cross-section in
powers of (ri) and (rirj/).
in this subsection we shall be more careful with the
matching conditions across the dierent regions and determine the rst corrections to the

9

absorption probability (3.16) using the improved matching technique developed in [18]. at
this point, those concerned with the dual eld theory interpretation of our results may
wish to skip directly to the nal answer (3.44).

first consider the near horizon regions ii. instead of dropping the last term in equation

(3.7) we solve this equation by expanding ii(zi) in powers of (ri)4 (1 + (rj/2)4):

1 (zi) +    .
writing equation (3.7) order by order in the expansion parameter we have

and iii appropriately. furthermore, we can take the homogeneous parts of ii

consider the limits   1,   1 and the limit   1 in region ii and solve there for
the inhomogeneous parts of ii

4 field theory analysis

we are interested in maximally supersymmetric rg ows for n = 4 sym theory that arise
from breaking the conformal invariance. in the infrared it has been conjectured that these
ows can be viewed as a deformation of the n = 4 superconformal xed points by some
irrelevant operators [18, 19, 24]. in particular, the gauge coupling beta function vanishes
and the dimension of operators in short supersymmetry representations are constant along
such ows.

first consider the d3-brane background with so(6) = su(4) invariant harmonic func-

tion

4

h = h +(cid:18)r
r (cid:19)

.

(4.1)

interpreting r as the rg energy scale the dual eld theory ows in the ir (r  0) to the
n = 4 superconformal xed point. the corresponding deformation, which is controlled
by the parameter h, can be seen to arise from the irrelevant dirac-born-infeld (dbi) cor-
rections to the sym theory [18]. alternatively, on the basis of p su(2, 2|4) representation
theory the lagrangian of the dual eld theory was conjectured to be [19, 24]

l = l0

where

l0 =

the corresponding dual eld theory is still given by (4.2) but the su(n) gauge symmetry
is broken to s(u(n1)  u(n2)) by the non-zero expectation values for the scalar elds as
described in the introduction. for example, this means that there will be a mass term in
the lagrangian l0 for the w particles.

our main goal is to identify the origin and corresponding physical processes associated
with the logarithmic corrections to the cross-section calculated in the previous section. for
worldvolume on-shell processes involving the coupling of the dilaton eld to the brane, the
important terms in the lagrangian (4.2) that arise from the dbi action are

o4 = tr(cid:16)ff (cid:17) ,
o8 = tr(cid:18)ff ff   1

4 (cid:16)ff (cid:17)2(cid:19) .

also, the coupling of the dilaton eld to the brane world-volume is seen to be

sint = z d4x  o = z d4x 

1

4 (cid:20)o4 +

t3o8 +   (cid:21) ,

(4.5)

(4.6)

where o4 and o8 are dened in (4.5). notice that a more careful analysis would require
the use of the symmetrized trace as proposed by tseytlin [31].

to calculated the cross-section one starts by calculating the two-point function of the

chiral primary operator o

where the subscript h reminds us that we are working with the deformed lagrangian (4.2).
then, the absorption cross-section is given by [32]

(x) = do(x)o(0)eh

,

(4.7)

 =

22
2i

disc (s)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) p0=

~p=0

,

(4.8)

where s = p2 and (s) is the fourier transform of (x). the momentum space two-point
function (s) is analytic in the complex s-plane except possibly for poles or cuts on the
real axis. the discontinuity across the cuts is given by disc (s) = (s + i)  (s  i).
since the operator o is a chiral primary operator its two-point function is protected.

15

this means that we can use perturbative eld theory methods to calculate the two-point
function and compare the result with the strongly coupled gravity calculation.

now that we have reviewed the connection between the classical cross-section and the
dual eld theory, we interpret the logarithmic corrections to the cross-section found earlier
from the eld theory point of view. we shall consider the two cases ri   and ri  
discussed in section 2 separately.

4.1 small brane separation (ri  )
first, consider the case where / is kept xed in the   0 decoupling limit. the grav-
itational dual geometry is sketched in gure 1(c) of section 2. in this case the absorption
probability becomes

(4.9)

the tree-like throat geometry is dual to the n = 4 sym theory away from the origin of
the moduli space of vacua, i.e. there is a vev for the higgs eld that breaks conformal
invariance and the gauge symmetry to s(u(n1)  u(n2)). the corresponding harmonic
function in the gravity solution is given by (4.4) with h = 0. the theory ows from the
uv conformal point with gauge group su(n1 + n2) to the ir conformal xed points with
gauge group su(ni).

in the gravity calculation we assumed   mw , which means that we are studying
deformations of the ir xed points. in the case of the i-th throat, we are studying the rg
ow near the su(ni) ir xed point with conformal invariance broken due to a deformation
by an irrelevant operator of dimension 8. in fact, down the throat the harmonic function
becomes eectively [24]

4

+(cid:18)ri
r (cid:19)

,

(4.10)

where r  i is the radial coordinate centered at the i-th stack of branes. we conclude
that in this limit the theory is described by the lagrangian (4.2) with h = (rj/2)4. the
deformation in this lagrangian is the result of integrating out the massive w particles,
dening an eective lagrangian near the ir xed point. this is analogous to the situation
where a brane is placed in the near-horizon geometry of a large number of branes. there,
the correct action describing the probe dynamics is the dbi action, which eectively de-
scribes the eect of integrating out all the massive strings stretching between the probe
and the branes [33  36].

to make the idea of the previous paragraph more precise consider the su(n1 + n2)
sym theory with bosonic lagrangian given by (4.3). the vev for the scalars h~i =
2 diag(i1,i2) breaks conformal invariance and the gauge symmetry to s(u(n1) 
u(n2)). for energies   mw , we can integrate out the w particles and obtain an eective
action for the su(ni) light degrees of freedom. this is similar to the case n1 = n and
n2 = 1 that has been extensively studied in the literature [33 36]. we refer the reader to
these references for the details. since we are interested in the large n limit only the planar
diagrams contribute to the eective potential. the rst non-vanishing one-loop diagram
involves 4 su(ni) coloured external legs. in our conventions, the resulting contribution to
the lagrangian is [35]

l1 =

y m

(2/)4 njtr(cid:18)fabf bcfcdf da 

1

4 (cid:16)fabf ab(cid:17)2(cid:19) ,

(4.11)

where g2
y m = 2gs and the factor nj is because we have a su(nj) colour index around the
loop to sum over. notice that the elds in this expression take values in the su(ni) lie
algebra. we see that for h = (rj/2)4 = (22g2
y m nj)/(2)4 the one-loop result (4.11)
gives exactly the same answer as (4.2) if we take the irrelevant operator o8 to arise from the
dbi corrections. furthermore, the f 4 terms are exact because they are not renormalized
by higher loop diagrams [37]. to summarize, we start with pure sym theory and break
conformal invariance by going to the coulomb branch of the theory. by integrating out
the massive w particles we derived an eective lagrangian near the ir xed points that
has the form conjectured in [18, 19, 24].

following the analysis of [18] the two-point function for the operator o dual to the

dilaton eld is

(4.12)

where we are just keeping the terms that will give the log corrections calculated in the
gravity approach. now the analysis is entirely similar to the one presented in [18]. we
refer the reader to that paper for the details. the rst term in the last equality gives the
leading term in the scattering cross-section, while the second term gives the logarithmic
correction. the latter is associated with a process where a virtual pair of gauge particles

17

interacts with the incident wave to create a pair of gauge particles. the strength of such
interaction is determined by the eective action that arised from integrating out the w
particles. to match the logarithmic term in the eld theory calculation we should set the
ultraviolet cut o to  = /r 2
i . this is related to the natural scale in the eld theory

side mw by   mw /gni. a better understanding of the ultraviolet cut o requires

extending the cross-section calculation to the next order [18]. notice, however, that the
scale  = /r 2
is the gravity mass gap and may be related to the existence of colour
i
singlet condensates of w particles at strong coupling [15, 25].

4.2 large brane separation (ri  )

as explained in section 2 the two throats can be separated in the decoupling limit as long
as /   (recall gures 1(c) and 1(d)). here we consider the eects of connecting
both throats using the full d3-brane geometry with harmonic function given by (4.4) with
h = 1. in this case the absorption probability becomes

pi =

(4.13)

in the dual eld theory we start with the action (4.2) with gauge group su(n1 + n2)
and h = 1. additionally, the vev for the higgs eld breaks the gauge symmetry to
s(u(n1)  u(n2)). this is very similar to the single-centered case studied in [18] where
conformal invariance was broken by setting h = 1. intriligator argued that in the uv this
theory is dual to the asymptotically at space. in the ir we end up with the su(ni) ir
conformal xed points corresponding to each throat.

it is convenient to write the operators o4 and o8 in (4.5) using the following notation

where the indices a, b, ... run over the su(n1) gauge group and the indices a, b, ... over the
su(n2) gauge group. in the expression for o8 we wrote just the terms that are important
for the absorption by the rst hole. also, we dropped a four point vertex with one su(n1)
gauge particle, one su(n2) gauge particle and two w bosons ( f abf bcf cdf da) because

it gives a negligible correction for large n. similarly to the previous section, the two-point

figure 3: feynman diagrams for the absorption cross-section by the rst black hole. after
summing over the ym indices we see that the leading order term arising from the diagram (a)
is proportional to (n1)2 and that the logarithmic corrections that arise from the closed loops in
the top diagrams of (b) and (c) are proportional to (n1)3 and (n1)2n2, respectively. this is in
agreement with the gravity calculation.

where we are just keeping the leading terms. first consider the terms inside the squared
brackets in the last equality. the rst term is the two-point function for the su(ni)
theory at the infrared conformal xed point and it gives rise to the leading term in the
absorption probability (4.13). this term is associated with a process where the incident
wave interacts with the brane to create a pair of gauge particles (see gure 3(a)) [30]. the
rst logarithmic correction in the absorption probability (4.13) arises from the second term
in the squared brackets. this correction was analyzed in [18] and it is associated with a
process where a virtual pair of gauge particles interacts with the incident dilaton wave to

19

create a pair of gauge particles (see gure 3(b)). finally, the other logarithmic correction
in the cross-section arises from the third term in the squared brackets. this corresponds
to a process where a virtual pair of w bosons interacts with the incident dilaton wave to
create a pair of gauge particles (see gure 3(c)). as observed in the previous subsection, an
appropriate understanding of the uv cut o predicted by the gravity result (4.13) would
require extending the analysis to the next order.

8

the cross-section for all the above processes is calculated from the discontinuity of the
momentum space two-point function across the positive real axis in the s-plane. in fact,
the correction r d4zhow
4 (0)ih=0 is also associated to the creation of a pair of
w bosons via a virtual pair of gauge particles. however, in this case the momentum space
two-point function has an extra discontinuity in the s-plane over the real axis for s  mw .
since we work at energies   mw , well below the threshold where a new channel for
w boson pair production opens, this process is not seen in the gravity calculation here
employed. similarly, the fourier transform of the terms outside the squared brackets in
(4.15) will have a cut for s  mw and are associated with the creation of w boson pairs.

5 concluding remarks

the main goal of this work was to investigate the coulomb branch of n = 4 sym theory
using the ads/cft correspondence. this was done by studying the scattering of a mini-
mally coupled scalar eld by two parallel stacks of d3-branes. technical reasons forced us
to consider processes at energy scales much smaller than the threshold for w boson pair
production. despite this fact we were still able to nd new phenomena in this phase of
the theory. firstly, for small brane separation, we considered the eld theory dual to the
tree-like throat geometry. this is a point on the coulomb branch of n = 4 sym theory.
near the ir xed points the theory can be described by integrating out the massive w par-
ticles. as a result, the eective lagrangian leads to a correction to the cross-section that
is associated with the creation of gauge particles through the production of virtual pairs
of gauge particles. this result is perfectly consistent with the classical gravity calculation.
secondly, for large brane separation, we considered the theory that results from connecting
both throats with asymptotic at space. this is associated with the dbi corrections to
the sym theory. in this case we found corrections to the cross-section that are associated
with the creation of gauge particle pairs through the production of virtual pairs of gauge
particles and of w bosons. for both small or large brane separation the w particles that
arise from the su(n)  s(u(n1)  su(n2)) symmetry breaking process are seen to play

20

an important role in the ads/cft correspondence.

it would be very interesting to extend our results to higher energies. in particular, one
would like to see the channel for w bosons pair production to open up in the gravitational
side of the correspondence. however, the scale in the gravity side is given by the mass
gap energy mg = mw /gn. as noticed earlier, this fact is expected to be related to the
existence of colour singlets of bps stretched strings with large binding energy. hence, by
studying the classical absorption for energies   mg we could obtain some information
about these bound states. maybe our best hope would be to study numerically the solutions
of laplace equation in the double-centered d3-brane geometry. as far as the w particles
are concerned, it looks that in the gravity limit these particles are not seen directly and
that we may need the full string theory on ads5  s5 to recover them.

an obvious extension of this work is to consider the scalar absorption by the double
centered m-brane geometries. unfortunately, in this case we do not have the input from
d-brane and sym physics to fully understand the dual eld theory picture. another
interesting venue of research would be to study the four- and ve-dimensional black hole
cases. these are related to the ads3/cf t2 and ads2/cf t1 dualities, respectively.
