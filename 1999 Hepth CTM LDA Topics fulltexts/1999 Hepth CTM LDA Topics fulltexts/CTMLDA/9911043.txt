actually, case n = 4, suppression contributions arising higher curvature interactions even stronger schematic analysis indicates. consider interactions involving ricci tensor scalar, i.e., rr r2, since contributions vanish leading order equations motion. hence eective action (4.1), curvature squared interaction equivalent four-dimensional euler density would include additional ricci squared terms. however, since later topological term four dimensions, aect equations motion n = 4.8 cgnm/rn1 appearing hence detailed analysis {$9906064$} would show correction 2 schematic analysis comes coecient precisely zero n = 4. hence produce nonvanishing result four dimensions, one would consider curvature c(g4m )2/r6. cubed interaction would give rise correction h event, greatly suppressed compared g4m/r2 correction appears randall-sundrum scenario. 4 might comment experimental tests already probed 1/r2 corrections newtonian gravitational potential see e.g., {$9604090$}. observations good agreement einstein gravity, predicts post-newtonian corrections form (g4m )2/r2 nonlinearities gravitational eld equations. course, context solar system tests astrophysical context, expect einstein corrections swamp brane-world corrections since g4m . section 3.3, one expect thermodynamic properties (n+1)- dimensional black holes bound planck brane closely approximate black holes arising n-dimensional einstein gravity, least large black holes. latter case, black hole geometry brane closely resemble einstein solution n-dimensions, surface gravity hawking temperature close expected value. corrections suppressed (gnm )1/(n3). one striking results section four-dimensional thermodynamic mass agreed precisely standard asymptotic mass calculated brane. would interesting see 8 precisely cancellation renders pure einstein gravity four dimensions nite one-loop {$9604090$}. 19 result extends higher dimensions. section 3.3, found naive three-dimensional entropy c/4g3 matched quite well = a/4g4 large black holes surprising since three-dimensional theory gravity black holes. fact, remarkable agreement expected hold arbitrary dimensions. point area higher dimensional event horizon comes region near planck brane. consider approximating area large (n+1)-dimensional black hole cylinder extends brane z = zmax xed radius r, closes disk xed z = zmax. first, note circumference horizon measured brane c = rn2n2 (4.2) n2 area unit (n2)-sphere. now, contribution (n+1)- dimensional area cylinder ac = 2rn2n2 z zmax z(cid:19)n1 (cid:18) dz 2 n 2 contribution disk = rn2n2h1 (/zmax)n2i ad = 2 n 2 rn1n2 (/zmax)n1 . (4.3) (4.4) hence horizon extends bulk /zmax 1, one leading order using relation (2.8) newtons constants brane bulk, one = 4gn+1 = c 4gn . (4.6) hence see ads geometry conspires reproduce precisely black hole entropy n-dimensional einstein gravity. course, one expect correspondence (4.6) bulk brane entropies continue hold small black holes. indicated eqs. (4.3) (4.4), corrections relation (4.5), suppressed /zmax, revealing higher dimensional nature black hole. course, crude model give 20 = 2 n 2c . (4.5) detailed form corrections. passing, note black strings constructed letting g eq. (2.1) n-dimensional black hole, {$9604090$}, corrections vanish since zmax . hence correspondence (4.6) black hole entropy calculated bulk planck brane would exact. quite general grounds one expects surface gravity constant event horizon {$9604090$}, hawking temperature brane bulk spacetime. however, appears large black holes prefer radiate brane. large number species particles brane compared gravity bulk. one crudely estimate decay rate dm/dt d, horizon area relavent spacetime dimension. hence, example, large schwarzschild black hole radius r0 three-brane, = 4 1/r0, usual result dm/dt 1/r2 0. ve-dimensional standpoint, = 5 area approximately r2 0 above. thus gravitational hawking radiation bulk would contribute dm/dt /r3 0, much smaller. small black holes behave dierently. g4m < , black hole behaves like ve-dimensional schwarzschild solution. radius event horizon r0, one still 1/r0. hence four-dimensional radiation still yields dm/dt 1/r2 0. ve-dimensional area approximately r3 0, bulk radiation also contributes dm/dt 1/r2 0. however case, latter contribution smaller black hole radiates bulk single species, i.e., ve-dimensional graviton, brane radiation involves species brane-matter elds. still, small black holes, one expect relation r0 2g4m modied, evolution small black holes would principle distinguishable pure einstein gravity. may implications primordial black holes {$9604090$}. section 3.2, found geometry large black holes resembled attened pancake. note purely dimensional grounds, one expect large gnm zmax (cid:0)gnm/n3(cid:1) (4.7) constant . observation (independent value ), one nds robust result proper distance black holes extend planck brane lz log(cid:0)gnm/n3(cid:1) . 21 (4.8) hence one expect quite generally large black holes, lz larger ads scale , still much smaller extent horizon brane r (gnm )1/(n3). hence large black holes always pancake geometry. authors {$9604090$} presented interesting idea physical extent black holes planck brane related gregory-laamme instability {$9604090$}. suppose start black string described (2.1) g metric black hole mass . since proper distances surfaces constant z shrinking r = r/z due ads geometry, eective mass scale nite z (gnm ) = (/z)n3gnm . (4.9) idea {$9604090$} horizon extend far past limit (gnm ) n3, otherwise becomes long narrow, gregory-laamme instability would arise due long-wavelength metric uctuations. cut-o arises conning nature ads geometry allows wavelengths shorter . assume instability sets right (gnm ) n3, nd zmax = (cid:0)gnm/n3(cid:1)1/(n3) lz (4.10) (4.11) n 3 log(cid:0)gnm/n3(cid:1) . hence suggestion {$9604090$} yields result consistent (4.8), predicts pancake-like geometry large black holes planck brane (see also {$9604090$}). construct exact solution describing black hole bound three-brane, one would need start ve-dimensional analog c-metric. unfortunately, metric yet known. however, following qualitative features must present. accelerate black hole, one needs analog cosmic string. four spatial dimensions, one compresses string matter make thinner thinner, eventually form horizon become black string. thus expect vacuum solution describing accelerating ve-dimensional black hole actually contain black string. string thin, would break individual black holes {$9604090$}. thickness black string must least comparable ads scale. similar picture arrived {$9604090$}. one accelerating black string solution, one able cut asymptotic region introduce three-brane lower dimensions. 22 acknowledgements gth rcm would like thank participants itp program super- symmetric gauge dynamics string theory stimulating discussions, especially steve giddings, lisa randall raman sundrum. work partially supported upv grant 063.310-eb187/98. gth supported part nsf grant phy95-07065. rcm supported part nserc canada fonds du quebec. itp, rcm supported phy94-07194. paper report numbers: ehu-ft/9914, nsf-itp-99-134, mcgill/99-35. 23
