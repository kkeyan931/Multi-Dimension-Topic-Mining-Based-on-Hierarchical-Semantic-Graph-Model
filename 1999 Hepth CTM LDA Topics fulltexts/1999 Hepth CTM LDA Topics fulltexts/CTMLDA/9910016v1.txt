abstract

we show that extremal correlators of chiral primary operators in n =4 super-
symmetric yangmills theory with su (n ) gauge group are neither renormalised
at rst (g2) order in perturbation theory nor receive contribution from any in-
stanton sector at leading order in the semiclassical expansion. this lends support
to the strongest version of a new prediction recently put forward on the basis of
the ads/scft correspondence.

1 introduction

a new prediction of the correspondence between type iib superstring on ads5  s5
and n =4 supersymmetric yangmills (sym) theory with su(n) gauge group [1, 2]
is that a certain class of n-point correlation functions, represented by extremal corre-
lators of chiral primary operators1, satisfy some non-renormalisation theorem. in [5],
dhoker, freedman, mathur, matusis and rastelli have argued that type iib supergrav-
ity requires the above n-point functions to decompose into products of n  1 free-eld
two-point functions. moreover the overall coecient was argued not to be renormalised
with respect to its free eld value. something similar is known to happen for two- and
three-point functions of cpos [6, 7, 8] as well as for the chiral anomaly2 [10].

1we adhere to the common practice of calling n =4 chiral primary operators or simply cpos
the scalar composite operators of protected dimension  =  belonging to the representation with
dynkin labels [0, , 0] of the su (4) r-symmetry group. they are lowest components of short su (2, 2|4)
supermultiplets. other shortening conditions are possible [3, 4].
2the 1/n 2 corrections to the chiral anomaly are reproducible in terms of one-loop corrections to
the lowest order supergravity approximation due to the absence in the bulk of the would-be singleton
elds [9].

1

it is the purpose of this letter to show that extremal correlators of cpos are neither
renormalised at rst order in perturbation theory3 nor receive contribution from any
instanton sector at leading order in the semiclassical expansion.

the non-renormalisation properties displayed by extremal correlators of cpos at
rst order in perturbation theory suggest that the strong version of the argument pro-
posed in [5] on the basis of the ads/scft correspondence should be valid. one might
then expect that any extremal correlators, either involving single-trace operators or
multi-trace operators, should be independent of the coupling constant g, hence tree-
level exact, for any nite n.
if this were the case no higher derivative term in the
type iib superstring eective action should be capable of giving a non-vanishing am-
plitude of this kind. sl(2, z) invariance of type iib superstring requires that string
loop corrections to higher derivative terms be accompanied by non-perturbative d-
instanton corrections. it is by now widely appreciated that the counterpart of type iib
d-instantons in the ads/scft correspondence are sym instantons [11, 12, 13]. these
are responsible for interesting u(1)b violating processes such as a 16-dilatino amplitude,
that has been used for a quantitative test of the ads/scft correspondence [12, 13], as
well as for some u(1)b preserving processes such as the higher derivative corrections to
the four stress-tensor/graviton amplitude. motivated by these considerations we have
extended our analysis to the non-perturbative level.

the plan of the letter is as follows. after briey reviewing the description of n =4
supersymmetric yangmills theory in terms of n =1 superelds, we demonstrate the
vanishing of the lowest perturbative correction to the extremal correlators. we then
pass to describe the fermion zero-mode counting in instanton backgrounds and show
that non-perturbative corrections are absent as well. finally we comment on the bearing
and extension of our results in view of the ads/scft correspondence.

we would like to stress that the results we are going to show are valid both for
single- and for multi-trace operators in the relevant su(4) representation and for any
number of colours n, suggesting the validity of the non-renormalisation theorem well
beyond the reach of the lowest supergravity approximation, valid at large n and large
t hooft coupling. we suspect, but we do not explicitly show, that the result should
hold for extremal correlators in n =4 sym theories with other gauge groups.
2 n =4 sym theory in the n =1 formulation
the eld content of n =4 sym [14] is realised combining one n =1 vector supereld,
v , with three n =1 chiral superelds, i (i=1,2,3), all in the adjoint representation of
the gauge group. the six real scalars, i (i=1,2,. . . ,6), of the theory are assembled into
three complex elds, namely

i =

1

2 (cid:16)i + ii+3(cid:17) ,


i =

1

2 (cid:16)i  ii+3(cid:17) ,

(1)

that are scalar components of the superelds i . three of the weyl fermions are
the spinors of the chiral multiplets, denoted by i, and the fourth spinor,  = 0,
3dan freedman has informed us that a similar result has been independently obtained by witold

skiba.

together with the vector, a, form the vector multiplet.
in this formulation only a
su(3)  u(1) subgroup of the original su(4) r-symmetry group is manifest, with i
and 
i transforming in the representations 3 and 3 of su(3) respectively, while v is a
singlet.

to the adjoint representation, viz.

i (x, , )ta .

in equation (2) the standard dependence on the coupling constant g is recovered by
substituting v  2gv , i  gi and

contains the ghosts that are not displayed here since they do not contribute to the
green functions that we will consider at the order at which we compute them.

3 perturbative non-renormalisation

we consider correlation functions of the form

gext(x, x1, . . . , xn) = hq()(x)q(1)(x1) . . .q(n)(xn)i ,

with  = 1 + 2 + . . . + n. the operators q() in (11) are cpos, i.e. scalar composite
operators of protected dimension  =  that are lowest components of short su(2, 2|4)
supermultiplets. for single-trace cpos one has

qi1i2...i(x) = xperms 

trh(i1)(i2) . . . (i)  avour contractionsi .

(12)

for multi-trace cpos one has an obvious generalisation of (12). the correlator (11)
is extremal in that there is only one su(4) invariant contraction of the (implicit)

4

avour indices, i.e. there is only one su(4) singlet in the product of the representa-
tions with dynkin labels [0, , 0], [0, 1, 0], . . . , [0, n, 0]. up to an overall non-vanishing
clebschgordan coecient, computing (11) is equivalent to computing

g(x, x1, . . . , xn) = htrh(1)(x)itrh(

1)1(x1)i . . . trh(

1)n(xn)ii .

(13)

the tree-level contribution to these functions corresponds to a diagram with  lines
exiting from the point x, which form n dierent rainbows connecting x to the points
xi, the ith rainbow containing i lines

xj

the free scalar propagator is

a(x)

bj (y)i(0) =

ab

(2)2

i
j

(x  y)2 ,

(14)

hence at tree-level the green function (13) reads

g(0)(x, x1, . . . , xn) =

(x  x1)21 . . . (x  xn)2n xperms (cid:20)tr (t a(1)t a(2) . . . t a())

 tr (t a1 . . . t a1 ) tr (t a1+1 . . . t a1+2 ) . . . tr (t a1+...+n1+1 . . . t a)(cid:21) .
using the n =1 description introduced in the previous section, we will momentarily
show that the rst order perturbative correction to (13) and hence to (11) is zero. let
us preliminarily notice that if one keeps all the component elds in the vector super-
multiplets, i.e. if one does not employ the wz gauge, and works in the fermi-feynman
gauge  = 1 there is no rst order correction to the propagators of the elementary elds.
the o-shell self-energy corrections due to vector exchange, including a very peculiar
c  d exchange, cancel the contributions due to the three chiral multiplets [16]. in this
approach, we do not need bother with uv and ir problematic corrections to two-point
functions of elementary elds.

(15)

it is easier to rst analyse the possible corrections to the relevant diagrams in su-
pereld language, in which (13) is obtained as the  = 0 component of a correlator of

5

(anti)chiral superelds. the choice of avour indices made in (13) is crucial in all subse-
quent computations. in particular, one can easily check that it prevents the insertion of
(anti)chiral trilinear vertices at order g2. the only relevant diagrams are thus obtained
by the insertion of vector supereld lines into the tree diagram. it is very convenient
to regularise the diagrams by point-splitting. according to the form of the action in
components, see equations (9) and (10), vector exchange between a pair of chiral lines





v





corresponds to three dierent diagrams for the lowest scalar components

+

cd













(16)

in the following we will refer to the sum of these three terms as vector exchange unless
otherwise stated. in (16) the internal propagators are respectively [16]

ab

(x)ab

(y)i(0) =

haa
(2)2(x  y)2 ,
hc a(x)db(y)i(0) = 
(2)2(x  y)2 ,
hda(x)db(y)i(0) = ab(x  y) .

the resulting rst order corrections to the correlator (13) are of the form

g(1)(x, x1, . . . , xn) = g2 c(n, n) g(x, x1, x2, . . . , xn) ,

(17)

(18)

(19)

(20)

where the coecient c(n, n) comes from colour contractions and the spatial dependence
is encoded in the function g(x, x1, x2, . . . , xn). in order to proceed, it is convenient to
distinguish two types of corrections, those in which there is a vector exchange within
a single rainbow and those in which the vector lines are inserted between two dierent
rainbows. contributions of the rst kind will be denoted by g(a)
and the others by
g(b)

.
corrections of the rst kind are exactly those that appear in the two-point functions
of cpos and have been argued to vanish for a variety of reasons [7, 8, 17]. nevertheless
we feel worth showing their vanishing by an explicit computation. each of the diagrams

in g(a)
is zero due to the vanishing of the corresponding contribution to the function
g(x, x1, x2, . . . , xn). more precisely, for a diagram with the insertion of the vector in
the rainbow connecting x and xi

in the limit u  x [8, 18], so that (23) and thus (21) go to zero due to the prefactor
(x  u)2. in conclusion
(26)

(x, x1, . . . , xn) = 0 .

in this case the limit u  x (removal of point-splitting) is nite but non-vanishing,
however the group-theory coecient c(b)(n, n) turns out to be zero. this can be proven
as follows. for compactness of notation and without loss of generality we consider the

in conclusion extremal correlators of the form (13) have zero rst order perturbative

corrections

g(1)(x, x1, . . . , xn) = 0 .

(31)

notice that the same analysis can be repeated step by step in the case of extremal
correlators involving multi-trace operators in short multiplets [3, 4, 18, 19]. the van-
ishing of the corrections of the rst kind, previously denoted by g(a), is still valid in
this case since it does not dependent on the colour structure. for what concerns the
second type of contributions, g(b), the argument described above still applies since it
only relies on the symmetry of the sum over permutations, that is a consequence of
wick contractions.

4 non-perturbative non-renormalisation

the power of supersymmetric instanton calculus [20], that has allowed non-perturbative
tests of the ads/scft correspondence [12, 13] will enable us to show that extremal
correlators receive no instanton contribution from any topological sector (labelled by
k) and for any number of colours (labelled by n) at leading semiclassical order. the
following argument heavily relies on the systematic of the gaugino zero-modes in the
multi-instanton background. an index theorem for fermions in the adjoint of su(n)
tells us that the number of gaugino zero-modes is 2n kn, where the factor of n takes
into account the number of supersymmetries. in the n =4 case under consideration,
however, only 16 of these gaugino zero-modes are exact zero-modes [11, 12, 13], i.e. those
corresponding to the 8 supersymmetry and 8 superconformal transformations broken
in the ym instanton background. the remaining 8kn  16 are lifted by the yukawa
interactions and appear in quadrilinear terms in the classical action, i.e. in the action
obtained after expanding the elds around the instanton conguration.

the gaugino zero-modes may be written as

where  a
only involve the lifted zero-modes (8kn16 of them) whose explicit expression will not
concern us here. a can be written in terms of the adhm data and their superpartners
that satisfy some complicated non-linear constraints, collectively denoted by super
adhm = 0
in the following. the only crucial point is that the true zero-modes neither enter the
non-linear super-adhm constraints super
adhm nor the fermion-quadrilinear term in the
classical action.

(34)

where d denotes the covariant derivative in the instanton background and the trilinear

the scalar-eld solutions induced by the presence of the fermionic zero-modes in

1 =  2f 3 + 

1 ,

(36)

where 
1 is a bilinear in the lifted gaugino zero-modes of avour 2 and 3 only. substi-
tuting the instanton-induced expressions for the scalar elds in the extremal correlators
(13) yields

where, except for an obvious d16 = d8d8  factor, the measure of integration d(k)
and the explicit form of the super-adhm constraints super

and play no role in the following. since only the rst operator could possibly absorb
the zero-modes of type 0 and 1, the integrand necessarily contains a factor of the form

n

10

( 0f  1)4( 1)4. then, using the fact that ()3 = 0 for any two-component grassmann
variable,

ginst(x, x1, . . . , xn) = 0

(38)

immediately follows for any extremal correlator. in fact in the case of three- and higher-
point functions extremality requires   4. for two-point functions of cpos, that are
always extremal, the values  = 2, 3 are allowed. the corresponding correlators have
vanishing instanton correction at lowest order because the 16 geometric zero-modes
cannot be saturated in these cases.

this proves the non-perturbative non-renormalisation of extremal correlators of
cpos with any number n of insertion points and for all n and k to leading order
in the semiclassical expansion around the instanton background. we will not dwell
into the study of perturbative corrections to the above instanton result, but we expect
them to vanish as much as perturbative corrections around the trivial vacuum cong-
uration vanish. the extension to any gauge group, though technically involved, should
be straightforward.

5 discussion

the results presented in this letter lend rm support to a new prediction of the
ads/scft correspondence [5], well beyond the regime of validity of the supergrav-
ity approximation.

it would be extremely useful to fully characterise the class of correlators that are
(expected to be) tree-level exact in n =4 sym theory. from a preliminary analysis of
cpos correlators, it seems that this interesting class could be restricted to those corre-
lators that involve only one su(4) singlet. in addition to the extremal correlators that
we have considered above, two- and three-point functions of cpos belong to this class.
as observed above, all two-point functions and some three-point functions are extremal
too. tests of the predictions arising for these cases from the ads/scft correspondence
[6] have been performed from the sym perspective both at one-loop [7, 18, 19, 21] and
at the non-perturbative level [18]. a judicious usage of the bonus u(1)b symmetry
[17] in the context of n =4 analytic superspace [8] gives a demonstration of the non-
renormalisation of two- and three-point functions of cpos [22]. the identication of
u(1)b-violating nilpotent super-invariants that began at ve points and above [22] and
were not listed in [23] prevents one from generically extending the same argument to
higher-point functions. proving the absence of the relevant nilpotent super-invariants
should allow one to prove the absence of quantum corrections to the extremal correla-
tors of cpos by simple algebraic means. a related issue is whether the knowledge of
correlators of cpos completely determines those of their super-descendants or there
are other nilpotent super-invariants that can spoil this naive expectation.

it would be interesting to see whether the n =4 analytic superspace analysis could
also shed some light onto the non-renormalisation properties of protected multi-trace
operators that satisfy more general shortening conditions [3, 4].
in particular, the
vanishing of their anomalous dimensions is supported by explicit perturbative and non-
perturbative computations (e.g. for a dimension four double-trace operator in the 84

11

representation of the su(4) r-symmetry) at weak coupling [18], but it is still waiting
for an ads conrmation.

acknowledgements

we would like to acknowledge dan freedman for early collaboration on the project,
stimulating discussions and a careful reading of the manuscript. we have also benetted
from discussions with ya.s. stanev, e. sokatchev, p. west and g.c. rossi. preliminary
results were presented by one of us (m.b.) at the 3rd annual tmr conference held
at sissa, trieste, italy, september 20 - 24 1999. m.b. would like to thank the aspen
center for physics, where this work was initiated, for the kind hospitality.
