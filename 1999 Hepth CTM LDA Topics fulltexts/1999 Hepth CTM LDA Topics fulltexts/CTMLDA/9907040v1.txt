abstract

in two-dimensional lattice fermion model a determinant representation for the two-
point correlation function of the twist eld in the disorder phase is obtained. this eld
is dened by twisted boundary conditions for lattice fermion eld. the large distance
asymptotics of the correlation function is calculated at the critical point and in the scal-
ing region. the result is compared with the vacuum expectation values of exponential
elds in the sine-gordon model conjectured by s.lukyanov and a.zamolodchikov.

1. introduction

during the last time the progress has been made in calculation of the long distance
asymptotics of a correlation functions of local elds in some integrable two-dimensional
quantum eld theories [1, 2]. usually in these theories two-point correlation functions of
local elds can be represented as an innite series of the form-factor contributions, which are
calculated using a method of the form-factor bootstrap [3] or the angular quantization [4, 5].
in [6, 7] a summation method of the form-factor decomposition of the correlation function
was developed. this method allows to obtain a closed expression for the correlation function
through fredholm determinant of the integral operator and to do analysis of asymptotic
behaviour of one.

in this paper we analyse a large distance behaviour of the two-point correlation function
of the twist eld (r) in the disorder phase of two-dimensional lattice fermion model. at
 = 1
2 this eld coincides with the disorder eld (r) and the correlation function of these
elds satises the following relation [8, 9]:

1e-mail: abugrij@bitp.kiev.ua
2e-mail: shadura@bitp.kiev.ua

h(0)(r)i = hi(0)i(r)i2,

(1.1)

where i(r) is a disorder eld in the ising model.

using the functional integral method in two-dimensional lattice fermion model, we obtain
a determinant representation of the correlation function. calculating the asymptotics of the
correlation function at r  , we nd the vacuum expectation values h(r)i. here index
 (0 <  < 1) denotes twisted boundary conditions for lattice fermion eld along the
correlation line. in scaling limit (massive fermion quantum eld theory) this eld is massive
analog of the twist eld in two dimensional conformal eld theory with central charge c = 1
[10].

in the free fermion point of the sine-gordon model the vacuum expectation value

< (r) > is connected by simple relation with the vacuum expectation value of the ex-
ponential eld exp(i) at  = 1
2. the sine-gordon model is described by the euclidean
action

s =

1

4 z dxd(cid:16)kk +  cos( )(cid:17) .

the free fermion point occurs at  = 1.

in this point the exponential eld can be dened by the braiding relations with the free

fermion eld [11]:

ei(,x)(, y) = (, y)ei(,x),

if y < x,

ei(,x)(, y) = e2i(, y)ei(,x),

if y > x.

(1.2)

as it was shown in [8, 9, 12] the correlation functions of the disorder elds satisfy the
following relations

h(0)(r)i = hcos 1

2(0) cos 1

2(r)i.

from here one gets

h(0)(r)i >=

1
2hei 1

2 (0) ei 1

2 (r)i +

1
2hei 1

2 (0) ei 1

2 (r)i.

(1.3)

(1.4)

using this equation, we can obtain a relation between the vacuum expectation values of the
disorder and exponential elds.

note that for calculation of the left and right hand sides of (1.4) it is nessesary to
regularize explicit expressions for the correlation functions that it leads to appearence of
the corresponding wave renormalization constants. to be rid of them at calculation of the
expactation values it is convenient to normalize the correlation functions on behaviour at
r  0. in this limit one gets from (1.4)

h(0)(r)i =

1
2hei 1

2 (0) ei 1

2 (r)i,

(1.5)

where we have used the following asymptotics for the correlation function of the exponential
elds at r  0 [13]

(1.6)

hei(0) ei (r)i = hei(+ )ir2 
.
then for a ratio of (1.4) in the limit r   and (1.5) one gets

hi2

h(0)(r)i|r0

=

2hei 1
2 (0) ei 1

2 i >2
2 (r)i|r0

hei 1

.

(1.7)

of (1.7) coincides. in this case we obtain from (1.7) hi = 2hexp(i 1

as it will shown below one can choose such normalization of the disorder elds that asymp-
totic behaviour of the correlation functions in denominators of the left and right hand sides
2)i. in the paper [13]
(also see [14]) it was conjectured the following expression for the vacuum expectation values
of the exponential elds

2(cid:19) 2
heii =(cid:18)m

exp"z 

0

dt

t   sh2 t

2
sh2 t

2  2et!# .

(1.8)

this expression it is easy to obtain by means of results of the paper [21]. here the asymptotic
behaviour of the correlation function of the exponential elds at r  0 was calculated.
comparing our result and (1.8), it is not hard to obtain for || < 1

hi = 4 2

hexp(i)i.

(1.9)

emphasize that this relation is correct for such normalization of the elds that the correlation
functions of the twist and exponential elds have the same asymptotics at r  0

h(0) (r)i =

r0

< ei(0) ei(r) > =
r0

r 2 2 .

in section 2 the determinant representation of the two-point correlation function of the
twist eld is derived.
in section 3 asymptotic behaviour of the correlation function are
considered and new determinant representation through the matrix of the toeplitz type
are obtained in the limit r  . in section 4, using this representation, asymptotics of
the correlation function is calculated. in appendices some relations used in this paper are
derived.

2. functional integral representation

of the correlation function

it is known [15, 16], that the correlation function hi(0)i(r)i in the two dimensional
ising model can be represented in the form of the functional integral for the lattice majorana
fermion theory with antiperiodic boundary conditions for the fermion eld with the exception
of the line [0, r  1], where the fermion eld has periodic boundary conditions.
lattice dirac fermion theory through a ratio of the following functional integrals

the same way let us dene the two-point correlation function of the eld (r) in the

with the action

h(0)(r)i = r d[ ]esr[]
r d[ ]es[] ,

sr[] = (  d) =x,

()d,(),

(2.1)

(2.2)

where () is a complex two component grassmann eld; the coodinates of the lattice sites
 = (x, y) run through the values x = 1, ..., nx, y = 1, ..., ny; d is the lattice dirac operator

d =  u

vt ut ! = 

v

1  tx

(1  ty) 1  tx ! .

1  ty

(2.3)

here x, y denote the shift operators along the x and y axes:
x() = ( + x), y() = ( + y),

where x, y are unit vectors. index r denotes that in action sr[] operator y has twisted
boundary conditions along the line [0, r  1] (r  1 = (r  1, 0)):

y(x, ny) = e2i(x, 0),

x = 0, 1, . . . , r  1.

in denominator (2.1) the action s[] coincides with sr[] by the form, but y satises
antiperiodic boundary conditions along all boundary.
it is not hard to check that the operator d satises the relation d1 = dt  k, where k

is the lattice klein-gordon operator

k = det d = uut + vvt = 2(1  t)2  t[(x  2 + x) + (y  2 + y)].

in the naive continuum limit (the lattice constant a  0) k = a2t(m2  ii), where
i = (i  1)/a and ma/2 = t 1
2 . from here the critical point of the model is
tc = 1, and the scaling region is determined by relation |tc  t| = ma/2. in momentum

representation the operator k is diagonal and the function

2  t

1

k(p) = 2(1  t)2 + 4t(cid:18)sin2 px

2

2(cid:19)
+ sin2 py

has unique minimum at px = py = 0 in the brillouin zone and unlike the usual lattice dirac
operator we have not problem with the fermion dubling.

in order to integrate over the fermion elds in the numerator (2.1), in the action sr[] it
is convenient to go to operator y with antiperiodic boundary conditions along all boundary.
after that we get additional term sr[] in the action sr[], which contains a lattice defect:

sr[] = s[] + sr[],

where

when

sr[] = t

here the projective operator p selects lattice sites on the line [0, r  1]
l = 0, 1, . . . , r  1;

pl,x = l,xny,y  1

0

0 y ! ,

r1xx=0
[ 1(x, ny)2(x, 0) +  2(x, 0)1(x, ny)] = (  p t  p ).
h(0)(r)i = hesr []i = r d[ ]es[]+sr[]
r d[ ]es[]

.

and

where  = 1  e2i and i (r) is a unit matrix of the size r  r.
through the integral over a auxiliary eld

 i (r)

0

for calculation of the functional integrals in (2.4) it is convenient to represent esr []

esr[] = ||z d[ ] exp[( 1) + (  p ) + (  p t )].

(2.5)

using(2.5) and integrating over () in (2.4), one gets

h(0)(r)i = ||z d[ ] exp[( 1) + (  p d1 p t )] =

= ||  |1 + p d1 p t| = | g|,

(2.6)
where | g| denotes the determinat of a block matrix of the dimension (2  2) with blocks of
the dimension (r  r). the matrix g has the form
g12

x,x cos 

(2.7)

g11
x,x sin 
x,x sin  + ii (r)
g12

x,x cos 

x,x sin  + ii (r)

g =

u(px) = 1  teipx,

g12
x,x =

(2)2

d2p
k(p)

eipx(xx)2t(u(px) + u(px)).

let us show that the correlation function (2.6) at  = 1
2 is equal to square of the correlation
function of the disorder eld in the ising model. for this it is necessary to do a similarity
transformation of the matrix g in (2.6) by means of the unitarity matrix q

q = ei5



2 ,

5 =  0 i
0 ! ,

ctg = t,

as result we obtain

g(r) = h(0)(r)i  | q  g  q1| = | cos2  + sin2  v  v t|,

(1  z)(1  z1)
(1  z1)(1  z)

,

(2.10)

.

(2.11)

here the matrix vx,x exactly coincides with classical expression for the toeplitz matrix [17],
the determinant of which determines the correlation function hi(0)i(r)i in the paramag-
netic phase of the ising model. it is obvious that (1.1) follows from (2.9) at  = 1
2. in further
we include coecient (2i)1 in the integration measure of contour integrals.

note that the transformation q is connected with particular version of the lattice dirac

operator (2.3). in the naive continuum limit we obtain for the action (2.2)

where



s[] =z d2 ()(mei5
x =  1

0 ! .

y =  0 i

i

(2.12)

at the critical point tc = 1 the angle  in (2.8) is equal to /4 and the transformation q is
the 5-rotation of the grassmann eld:  = exp(i5/8), after that the dirac action takes
the usual form

s[] =z d2 ()(m  ii)().

(2.13)

3. toeplitz determinant representation

of the correlation function

in this section we show that in the scaling limit (ma  0) at r   a evaluation of the

correlation function (2.9) can be reduced to a calculation of the toeplitz determinant:

where

g(r) = | cos2  + sin2  v  v t| =
x,x = i|z|=1

r|v ()  v ()t
| = |v ()|2,
(1  z1)(1  z)#
v ()(z) ="(1  z)(1  z1)

z(xx)v ()(z),

dz
z

v ()

(3.1)

(3.2)

is a toeplitz matrix. at  = 1

2 the kernel v ()(z) coincides with the kernel v (z) (2.10).

in appendix a it is shown that the correlation function (2.9) can be represented in the

following form

where

g(r) =

r|1  sin2  a|2,

(3.3)

ax,x = i|z1z2|<1

dz1dz2(z1)x(z2)x

(1  z1z2)

v 1(z1)v 1(z2).

here the integration contour passes between the cuts depicted on fig. 1.

using (3.3), we get

dzl qk
q2k
l=1[(1  zlzl+1)v (zl)]

,

z2l+1 = z1.

(3.5)

at r   the terms in the right-hand side of (3.5), which contain the product (zlzl+1)r, are
exponentially small, so that
ak = 2ki

(1  zl)(zl  )# 1
2kyl=1"(  zl)(1  zl)

l=1(1  zlzl+1)

at ma = 0 ( = 1) the integral in (3.6) has logarithmic divergence on the upper limit
(in a neighborhood of the upper right cone of the 2k-dimensional hypercube with the
coordinates zl = 1). let us isolate and evaluate this divergence:

ak

2kyl=1

1  zl(cid:19) 1
2kyl=1(cid:18)   zl

/maz1
2kyl=1

dzl

zl + zl+1

.

(3.7)

for derivation of this estimate we did the following substitutions of the integration variables:
zl = z
l = zl + 1. isolating the logarithmic singularity in the last integral,

l = (ma)z

l , z

l, z

we obtain

ak =

/maz1
2kyl=1

dzl

zl + zl+1

= kbk ln(ma) + const.

(3.8)

dierentiating over ma the left- and right-hand sides of (3.8), the coecients bk can be
expressed through the multiple integrals

bk = 2

1z0

2k1yl=1

dzl (cid:20)(1 + z1)(1 + z2k1)

(zl + zl+1)(cid:21)1

2k2yl=1

.

(3.9)

using (3.8) and (3.4), we get the asymptotic evaluation of the correlation function at r  ,
ma  0

+ const.

(3.10)

2 ln g() = ln(ma)

bk(cid:18)sin 
 (cid:19)2k

xk=1

the integrals in the rst three coecients in (3.9) can be reduced to the table ones

b1 = 1,

b2 = 2(2),

b3 = 4 2(2) + 6(4),

(3.11)

where (k) is the rieman -function

(k + 1) =

(1)k
k!

1z0

dx lnk x

.

decomposing in (3.10) the functions (sin /)2k over powers of  and using the values (3.11)
for the coecients bk, it is not dicult to get

b1

sin2 

2 = 2 + o(4),

6 = 2 + o(8),

(3.12)

i.e. every following term in the series (3.11) annihilates more high powers of 2k.

although the integrals (3.9) is hardly calculated for multiplicity higher ve, one can

assume that in more high orders relations of the type (3.12) also take place. then

 (cid:19)2k
bk(cid:18)sin 

xk=1

= 2.

it means that the generation function for the coecients bk has the form

1

2 arcsin2(z) =

bkzk.

xk=1

(3.13)

(3.14)

then for the determinant (3.1) we obtain

note that (3.14) allows to nd values of the integrals (3.9) of arbitrary multiplicity.

g() =

(ma)0

const  (ma)2 2

.

(3.15)

let us prove the asymptotics (3.15). the following observation is key for the proof (it
follows from the calculations in (3.7)): the asymptotic evaluation (ma  0) of the integrals
in (3.6) is insensitive to the exponent in the expression for kernel of the matrix vx,x. it
allows to introduce the new matrix v ()
x,x with the kernel (3.2). let us dene the correlation
function

(3.16)
where the matrix v () is determinated in (3.2). using the results of appendix a, (3.16) can
be represented as

g()(r) = | v ()  v () t|,

g()(r) =

r|1  a()|2,

(3.17)

where the matrix a() has the form

a()

x,x =i dz1dz2(z1)x(z2)x
(1  z1z2)

1

v ()(z1)v ()(z2)

.

(3.18)

the trace of the k-th power of the matrix a() is expressed through the 2k-multiple integral

sp[( a())k] =(cid:18)sin 

 (cid:19)2k z

2kyl=1

dzl

(1  zlzl+1)

2kyl=1"(  zl)(1  zl)

(1  zl)(zl  )# kyl=1

[1  (zlzl+1)r]. (3.19)

here, unlike (3.4), the factor (sin )2k appeares on account of the exponent  at contraction
of the integration contour. taking into account (3.19) at r  , we get the expression for
g()(r) which is similar to (3.4)

where

(3.20)

[1  (zlzl+1)r].

(3.21)

at r   the terms in (3.21) containing the power of (zlzl+1)r disappear. although the
rest integrals in (3.21) diverge on the upper limit the dierence between (3.6) and (3.21)

hence a ratio of the determinants (2.9) and (3.16) is also nite and it is not equal zero

| v ()  v () t|

(3.23)

therefore the singular over (ma) factor in g() coincides with one in the determinant
(3.16). since the matrix v () is a toeplitz matrix we can calculate (2.9) in limit r  ,
(ma)  0.
note that we have considered the ratio (3.23) in limit r = , (ma)  0. in the paper [13]
the correlation function of the exponential eld was normalized on the correlation function
in the massless fermion eld theory. therefore for comparison of our results with [13] it is
necessary to evaluate the ratio (3.23) in limit (ma) = 0, r  : in other words we must
verify that the value of  does not depend on a sequence of the limits.
it can show that at (ma) = 0 the dierence of the coecients (3.5) and (3.21) diers

from (3.22) on some term decreasing with increase of r

ak  a()

k = ak +

k(r)

for k(r) we have the following asymptotic evaluation

as a result we get at ma = 0 and r  

g(r)
g()(r)

=  exp(cid:20) 1

k(r)(cid:21).

xk=1

(3.24)

(3.25)

using (3.24), it is not hard to sum the series in the exponent of the right-hand side of (3.25)
and to obtain the following estimate

g(r)
g()(r)

=  + o(1/r).

(3.26)

4. asymptotics of the correlation function

in this section we calculate the large distance behaviour of the correlation function g(r).
we use the determinant representation (3.1) for it in this case. since in (3.1) the matrix v ()
x,x
is a matrix of the toeplitz type it can apply the mccoy and wu techniques [17], which they
used for the asymptotic evaluation of the correlation function in the ising model ( = 1
2 ).
this techniques requires some generalization for 0 <  < 1. in appendix b we obtained the

following asymptotic expression for the determinant of the matrix bv () (the formula b.24):

ln q(z1).

(4.1)

ln|bv ()| =

r

(r + 1)i dz

z

ln v () i dz ln p (z)


z

substituting here the explicit expressions for v ()(z), p (z) and q(z):

v ()(z) = p (z)q(z1), p (z) =  1  z
1  z!
ln p (z) i dz

ln v () =  i dz

(4.2)

one gets

thus

|bv ()| =

.

(4.3)

note that this expresion is derived at nite values of (ma) and r. the derivation of
(4.1) is also correct in the scaling region: (ma)  0, r  , r(ma) = const. however
at (ma) = 0, r = const the integrals in the right-hand side of (4.1) are divergent and the
calculation of | v ()| at (ma) = 0 and r   requires the special consideration.

note that the following ratio of determinants

| v ()()|

(4.4)

is nite both in the scaling regime and at the critical point. here we explicitly indicated a
dependent of the matrix v () on the parameter  (the matrix v ()(0) is determined by the
kernel (3.2) at  = 0).

the relation (4.4) it is not hard to obtain by means of (4.1). really, for the ratio of the

determinants in the left-hand side of (4.4) we get

ln | v ()()|
| v ()(0)|! = i dz ln p (z)

ln q(z1) +

where the lower index at the matrix (4.6) indicates its dimension. multiplying the matrix
(4.6) from the left by the triangular matrix lr and the right by the triangular matrix rr,

(4.10)

this allows to get from (4.8) and (4.10) the simple recursion relation for the determinants

which has the solution

(4.13)

taking into account (3.1), (4.3), (4.4), (4.7) and (4.13), g(r) one nds the following asymp-
totic evaluations for the correlation function

using these asymptotics one can assume that in the scaling limit (r  , ma  0, mar =
s = const) the correlation function g(r) has the scaling form

f (s, ) = lim r2 2

g(r) = 23 2

s2 2

f (s, ),

where the function f (s, ) has the asymptotics

f (s, ) =(

22 2

at s  ,

e2()s2 2

at s  0.

(4.16)

(4.17)

this scaling behaviour follows from the arquments:

1) the two-point scaling function f (s, ) have to interpolate between the behavior at
large distance at the critical temperature and the behavior at large distance at the critical
point, that is the asymptotics (4.17) have to result in asymptotics (4.14) (4.15).

2) at  = 1

2 the scaling function (4.16) and the asymptotics (4.17) have to coincide with
square of the scaling function and the asymptotics for the two-point correlation function of
the disorder eld in the ising model [18, 19, 20].

it is convenient to dene the ratio h(rm), which does not depend on a normalization

and the lattice cuto a,

h(rm) =

g(r)|r
g(r)|r0

=

f (s, )|s
f (s, )|s0

where r = (ra) denotes a dimensional distance.

to compare this asymptotics with the result of the paper [13] in the free fermion point

we use the following normalization for the correlation function at r  0 [13]

g(r) = r2 2

.

(4.19)

using this normalization, from the ratio (4.18) we obtain

(4.20)

in this work a determinant representation for the two-point correlation function of the
twist eld is obtained in the lattice fermion eld model. the large distance behaviour of
this correlation function is calculated and the vacuum expectation values of the twist elds
is found. this value diers from the vacuum expectation value of the exponential eld by
the constant.

for explanation of this fact one can bring the following arguments.

it is known that
the quantum elds dened by the commutation relations (1.2) realize the operator solution
of the isomodronomic deformation problem for the dirac equation [11]. the correlation
function of the twist elds (2.1) one can interpret as the functional integral in the dirac
fermion theory with given monodromy properties for fermion elds. then this correlation
function can be connected with other solution of the isomodronomic deformation problem
for the dirac equation. in order to check this asssumption it is necessary to calculate the
determinant (2.9) and to obtain a dierential equation for the correlation function of the
twist elds.

note that with our point of view in appendix b of the paper [13] instead of the vacuum
expectation values of the exponential elds the vacuum expectation values of the twist elds
was calculated but since the normalization on behaviour of the correlation function of expo-
nential eld at r  0 was used the right result (1.8) for the vacuum expectation values of
the exponential elds was obtained.

this work was perfomed with nancial support from ukrainian found fundamental

in this appendix we obtain the following representation for the determinant in (3.1) at

where for convenience we introduced the matrix

g(r) = | cos2  + sin2  c  c t| =

r|1  sin2  a|2

z(xy)c(z), c(z) =" (1  z)(1  z1)
it has dimension (r + 1)  (r + 1) (x, y = 0, 1, . . . , r) and 0 <  < 1. at  = 1

coincides with the matrix vx,y in the determinant representation of the correlation function

ax,y = i|z1z2|<1

dz1dz2(z1)x(z2)y

(1  z1z2)

c 1(z1)c 1(z2).

let us represent the product c  c t in the following form

in (a.3) we summed a geometric progression over x and used c(z1) = c 1(z). substituting
(a.3) in (a.1), we get

g(r) = |1  sin2 ( a + b)| = |(1  s2 a)  (1  s2 b)  s4 a  b|,

(a.4)

where s = sin .

note that matrix elements of the matrices a and b have the following asymptotic be-

haviour

and therefore the product a  b is a exponential small matrix. really,

g(r) =

r|(1  s2 a)|  |(1  s2 b)|.

(a.5)

(a.6)

let us show that |(1  s2 a)| = |(1  s2 b)| at r  . for this we write the matrix b in the
form

b = j  d  j,

where

using this representation, it is not hard to show that
|(1  s2 a)| = |(1  s2 d)|

the determinants in (a.8) it is convenient to decompose in the series

ln|1  s2 d| = sp ln(cid:16)1  s2 d(cid:17) =

so that

for k > 1 it is not hard to get the recurent relation

d2k = a2k + d2k2  a2k2.

(a.11)

(a.12)

for this in the integral representation (a.9) it is necessary to do the replacement zl 
(zl)1. after that we obtain new integration contours with |zlzl+1| > 1. contracting sequen-
tially these contours over the variables zl so that |zlzl+1| < 1 and calculating residues in the
poles zl = (zl+1)1, we get (a.12).
taking into account the initial condition (a.11), it is easy to check that a solution of
the recurent relation (a.12) is a2k = d2k. from here we obtain (a.8). then (a.8) and (a.6)
lead to (a.1).

note that putting  = 1

2 in (a.2), we get (3.3) from (a.1), and putting  = h in (a.1)

and  =  in (a.2), we get (3.17) from (a.1).

in this appendix we obtain the asymptotic evaluation of | v ()| at r

it is convenient to introduce the following notations

let us dene

(b.4)

f () = ln| b()|,

f (0) = 0, f (1) = ln| b|, bxy(1) = bxy, bxy(0) = (x  y),

for calculation of | b| we use the formula
f (),

ln| b| = f (1) =z 1

0

f () = sp b()  b1().

(b.5)

let us nd the inverse matrix b1(). note that the matrix b() at 0    1 has the
same analytic behaviour as the matrix b, therefore, for simplicity we only derive the inverse
matrix b1.

show that matrix d

is inverse to b up to an exponentially small term

(b.9)

in (b.9) the integration over z2 yields a contribution which is propotional to r+1 and
therefore, the last term in the right-hand side of (b.9) is exponentially small for any x, y.
the second term in the right-hand side of (b.9) gives the following contribution at the
contraction of the contour over z3

i|z3|<|z1|

d(z1z3)(z1)x(z3)y

z1(z1  z3)

q(z1

3 )  (x  y) = (x  y),
q(z1

(b.10)

where we took into account that the rst term in the left-hand side of (b.10) reduces to zero
at the extention of the contour over z3 to one of innite radius.

similarly for the rst term in the right-hand side of (b.9) one gets

i|z3|<|z1|

d(z1z3)(z1)x(z3)y

z1(z3  z1)

b(z1)
b(z3)

+ (x  y).

(b.11)

taking into account (b.10) and (b.11), we obtain

i<|zi|<1

from here it follows that b  e coincides up to o(r) with the second term in the right-hand
side of (b.8) of the product b  l.

now let us consider the product b  j et j

b  j et j = j (cid:16) j  b  j  et(cid:17)  j = 0 j (cid:16) bt  et(cid:17)  j,

(b.13)

where we used j  b  j = bt .
a transition from b, e to bt , et means the following transformations in contour inte-
grals (b.2) and (b.7): b(z)  b(z1), p (z)  q(z) and therefore, no calculating, we have
instead of (b.12)

(b.14)

(b.15)

collecting together (b.8), (b.12) and (b.15), one proves that d = b1 + o(r). thus for
f () in (b.5) we obtain

f () = sp b() h l()  e()  j  et ()  ji .

(b.16)

note that

sp b  j  et  j = sp j  b  j  et = sp(cid:16) b(cid:17)t

from here one gets

 et = sp(cid:16) b(cid:17)t
f () = sp b()(cid:16) l()  2 e()(cid:17) .

 et = sp b()t  e().

let us denote by

u1 = sp(cid:16) b() l()(cid:17) , u2 = sp(cid:16) b() e()(cid:17) ,

the dierence of the integrals over z2 in the second term of the right-hand side of (b.22) is
a integral over z2 around the point z1, that is

i(z1)

dz2

1

(z1  z2)2

b(z2)

=



z   1

b(z)!z=z1

.

then the second term in the right-hand side of (b.22) has the form

i dz ln b(z)


z

ln b(z) =



2 z dz



z (cid:16)ln2 b(z)(cid:17) = 0,

since the integral over a closed contour from a total derivative is equal to the zero.

thus

f () = (r + 1)i dz

z

ln b(z)  2i dz ln p (z)


z

ln q(z1).

(b.23)

integrating this expression over  in the limits [0, 1], we obtain

f (1) = ln| b| = (r + 1)i dz

z

ln b(z) i dz ln p (z)


z

ln q(z1).

(b.24)

substituting here the explicit expressions for b(z), p (z) and q(z) from (b.2) and (b.3) we
have

ln p (z1)! =  (p (0)  p (0)) = 0,

z

i dz
i dz ln p (z)

ln b(z) =  i dz

ln p (z) i dz
ln q(z1) = 2i dz ln p (z)  1

thus
