we investigate several models of coupled scalar elds that present discrete z2, z2  z2, z3 and other
symmetries. these models support topological domain wall solutions of the bps and non-bps
type. the bps solutions are stable, but the stability of the non-bps solutions may depend on the
parameters that specify the models. the bps and non-bps states give rise to bags, and also to
three-junctions that may allow the presence of networks of topological defects. in particular, we
show that the non-bps defects of a specic model that engenders the z3 symmetry give rise to a
stable regular hexagonal network of domain walls.

i. introduction

bogomolnyi, and prasad and sommereld [1], have
presented a way to nd topological solutions that sat-
urate the lower bound in energy. these solutions are
known as bps states, and they are supposed to play some
role in the development of modern particle physics, be-
cause there are supersymmetric models where they are
shorter multiplets, stable, and no continuum variation of
parameters can modify these bps states. in refs. [24]
one has investigated some models of coupled real scalar
elds in bidimensional space-time. these models present
peculiar features, such as the presence of the bogomolnyi
bound, with the corresponding appearance of rst-order
dierential equations that solve the equations of motion
in the case of static congurations. these refs. [24]
have found topological solitons in specic models by tak-
ing advantage of the trial-orbit method rst introduced
by rajaraman in ref. [5]. these investigations provide
a concrete way of nding bps states and suggest several
other studies, in particular on the subject of defects in-
side defects, as presented for instance in refs. [68] and
more recently in [915]. the investigations of defects in-
side defects presented in ref. [11,12,14,15] are natural
extensions of the former papers [24].

in supersymmetric models with chiral superelds the
presence of discrete symmetry may produce bps and
non-bps walls. the non-bps walls are solutions of the
equations of motion, and they do not necessarily saturate
the lower bound in energy. but the bps walls saturate
the lower bound in energy, and lie in shorter multiplets,
in a way such that they preserve the supersymmetry only
partially [1618]. there are bps states that preserve 1/2
and 1/4 of the supersymmetry [1623], and in the present
work we investigate several explicit examples. we start
by rst oering general considerations in sec. ii. we ex-
amine specic models in sec. iii, where we nd several
solutions, of the bps and non-bps type. see also the
more recent work [25,26], where one can nd other inves-

1

tigations concerning the bps domain wall junctions in
supersymmetric models.

our work continues in sec. iv, where we investigate
stability of several bps and non-bps solutions. this is
done not only to show stability, but also to see how the
bosonic matter behaves in the background of bps and
non-bps defects. the behavior of the fermionic matter
in the extended supersymmetric models can be investi-
gated by following the lines of refs. [14,27,28]. in sec. v
we investigate two other issues. the rst in sec. v a,
where we consider the entrapment of the other eld, as
in bag models [2931]. this possibility may be imple-
mented in the rst, second and third models, and the
bag may be of the bps or non-bps type, depending of
the particular model under consideration. we examine
the second issue in sec. v b, where we investigate fusion
of defects. here we briey review ref. [20], which in-
troduces investigations valid within the supersymmetric
context, and after we oer another possibility of showing
fusion of defects and stability of junctions, valid beyond
the context of supersymmetry.

in sec. vi we show how one can generate planar net-
works of bps and non-bps defects. there we show that
the three-junction that appears in supersymmetric mod-
els may be stable, but cannot generate a bps network
of defects. however, when we give up supersymmetry we
nd a model where domain wall junctions are stable, the
three-junction strictly obey the triangle inequality and
generate a stable network of defects. we summarize the
main results in sec. vii, where we end the present work.
the subject of this work may nd direct applications in
diverse branches of physics. besides the recent interest,
put forward in refs. [2123], we recall for instance that
the z3 group is the center of su (3), and this may guide us
toward applications involving strong interactions. some
examples can be found in ref. [32,33]. another possi-
bility is related to the z2  z3 symmetry, in an eort
to entrap the z3-symmetric portion of the model inside
the topological defect generated by the z2 symmetry.

other applications include issues related to cosmology
[34] and magnetic materials [35], and to pattern forma-
tion in systems of condensed matter [36]. the investi-
gations that we present are done in at space-time, in
the (d, 1) dimensional case. we use natural units, taking
h = c = 1, and the metric tensor presents signature in
the form (+,, ...,). in the present work we are mainly
concerned with the cases d = 1, 2, and 3. we specify the
spatial dimension along with the interest of the subject
under investigation.

ii. general considerations

e =

wij = w (i, i)  w (j, j)

(9)

here (i, i) is the i-th vacuum state of the model under
consideration. the reason for this is simple: the energy
of static congurations is

it can be rewritten in the form

e =

we recall that

dw

= w

d
dx

+ w

(12)

to see that the energy gets to the bound eb when the
eld congurations obey the rst-order equations (7) and
(8). this is the bogomolnyi bound, and the correspond-
ing solutions are bps solutions. the bps solutions are
linearly or classically stable  see sec. iv.

the energy of bps solutions can be also written as

eb =z 
=z 





dx (cid:18) d
dx(cid:19)2
dx(cid:0)w 2

 + w 2

dx(cid:19)2!
+(cid:18) d
(cid:1)

(13)

(14)

the above result shows that the gradient (g) and poten-
tial (p) portions of the energy



g =z 
p =z 



dx g(x) =z 
dx p(x) =z

contribute evenly to the total energy of the solution. al-
though this is shared by all the bps states, it is not
peculiar to bps states, since there are non-bps states
that also have energy evenly distributed in its potential
and gradient portions  see below.

in the case of two scalar elds, there are other possible
arrangements to the energy (10). we can, for instance,
consider the possibility

this expression is also minimized to obey eqs. (13) and
(14) when one sets

let us start with two real scalar elds  and . we

consider models dened via the lagrangian density

l =

this is valid in (d, 1) space-time dimensions. v = v (, )
is the potential. it has the general form

v (, ) =

w 2

 +

w 2


(2)

w = w (, ) is some smooth function of the elds 
and , and w = (w/) etc. this is the form of
the (real bosonic portions of the) models we deal with in
the present work. these models admit a supersymmetric
extension, and in the supersymmetric theory the function
w is the superpotential.

models dened via w (, ) present several interesting

properties [24]. the equations of motion are

for static eld congurations living in the (1, 1) space-
time, that is, for elds  = (x) and  = (x) they
reduce to

d2
dx2 = ww + ww
d2
dx2 = ww + ww

(5)

(6)

these equations are solved by rst-order dierential
equations

d

the energy of solutions that solve the rst-order equa-
tions are bounded to the value eij

b = |wij|, where

(18)

(19)

we can show that solutions to these equations (18) and
(19) only solve the equations of motion when we impose
on w (, ) the extra condition

w = w

(20)

unfortunately, however, this condition (20) factorizes
w (, ) into the sum w+(+) + w() when one ro-
tates the (, ) plane to (+, ), with

w = w + ifw

terms of two functions, w andfw . we use this to intro-

duce the complex superpotential

(28)

the superpotential w = w() now depends on the com-
plex eld  =  + i , and the harmonicity of both w

and fw appears via the cauchy condition on w. this is

the way we get from the investigations [24] to the recent
work in refs. [2123].

we guide ourselves toward the topological solutions by
introducing a topological current. this is the standard
procedure, and we can introduce for instance the topo-
logical current

 =

1
2

(  )

(21)

j 
bp s = w(, )

(29)

as rstly shown in ref. [15]. the condition (20) turns
the system into two decoupled systems.

we can consider another possibility to rewrite the en-

ergy (10). we set

e =

dx

dx"(cid:18) d
dx(cid:18)w

+ w(cid:19)2

d
dx  w

dx  w(cid:19)2#
+(cid:18) d
dx(cid:19)

d

(22)

this expression is also minimized to obey (13) and (14)
when we write

d
dx
d
dx

= w
= w

(23)

(24)

these equations (23) and (24) solve the equations of mo-
tion when one imposes on w (, ) the extra condition

w + w = 0

(25)

this result is interesting. it shows that for w (, ) har-
monic, we can solve the two (second-order dierential)
equations of motion (5) and (6) with two sets of two
rst-order dierential equations, the set of bogomolnyi
equations (7) and (8), and another one, given by eqs. (23)
and (24).

we make good use of this result by imposing that the
second set of rst-order equations (23) and (24) are still
bogomolnyi equations, that appear via the presence of

another functionfw . this new function is dened by

(26)

(27)

fw = w
fw = w

since w and fw are smooth functions, they are neces-

sarily harmonic. we then get the result that potentials
dened by harmonic functions can always be written in

it is dened in terms of w(, ), and the topological
charge is directly identifyed with the energy of the topo-
logical solution that satises the pair of rst-order equa-
tions (7) and (8). this denition identies the topological
charge with the energy of the bps solution. it expresses
the fact that the mass of a bps state is completely deter-
mined by its topological charge. this denition provides
a single way to infer stability of the bps states. this is a
nice way of dening the topological current, but it is not
complete, because it cannot see sectors of the non-bps
type. it is only eective for bps sectors, and that is the
reason for the label bps assigned to it. however, since
we need to identify every topological sector, we should
use another topological current. we can consider, for
instance

j  = (cid:18)
(cid:19)

(30)

it obeys j  = 0, and it is also a vector in the (, )
plane. the topological current (30) is the current that we
shall use in this work. we use this denition to obtain,
for static congurations

j t
 j  = t  = 2 g(x)

(31)

where g(x) is the gradient energy density of the solution.
this property can be used to infer stability of junctions,
for congurations that present energy density evenly dis-
tributed in their gradient and potential energy densities.
this is so because in this case t = 2g(x) = g(x) + p(x)
gives the full energy density, and may be used to show
that the junction process occurs exothermically. this
result was already introduced in ref. [24], and oers a
way of showing how the process of junctions of defects
may occur exothermically in models dened outside the
context of supersymmetry  see sec. v b.

up to here the calculations were done in (1, 1) space-
time dimensions. however, we can easily immerse the
system into (2, 1) or into (3, 1) space-time dimensions.
in the rst case, in d = 2 the solutions can be seen as
domain ribbons, and the energy is now multiplied by the

3

length of the ribbons. in the second case, in d = 3 we get
domain walls, and the energy is to be multiplied by the
area of the wall. the planar case is necessary for intro-
ducing junctions of domain ribbons [or of domain walls
if one immerses the system in the (3, 1) space-time] and
their corresponding planar networks. there are several
distinct possibilities, and in the sequel we specify some
cases. we recall that we single out topological sectors
using pairs of vacuum states. for bps sectors the en-
ergy is obtained via the superpotential, and we shall also
use the notation tij = |w (i, i)  w (j , j)|, identi-
fying the bps sectors with tensions or energies of the
topological defects.

iii. some specific models

our aim here is to introduce models of coupled scalar
elds, to illustrate how one can nd topological solu-
tions of the bps and non-bps type. we investigate sev-
eral models of coupled scalar elds, dened with smooth
functions w (, ). we organize the subject in the four
subsections that follow, where we examine four dierent
models.

of minima of the potential. for / > 0 the system sup-
ports several topological sectors. their energies or ten-
sions are given by, for solutions that connect the minima
(1, 0) and (1, 0)

t1
bp s =

4
3 ||

(37)

for solutions that connect the minima (1, 0) and

(0,p/) we get

t 1
bp s =

2
3 ||

(38)

for the non-bps solution that connects the minima

(0,p/) and (0,p/) we obtain
3 ||s 

t 1
nbp s =



4

(39)

there are bps solutions in the rst sector, which con-

nects the two minima (1, 0). they are

(x) =  tanh( x)
(x) = 0

(x) =  tanh(2  x)

(x) = s 

  2 sech(2  x)

(40)
(41)

(42)

(43)

the rst pair is of the one-component type, and is im-
portant for investigating the presence of defects inside
defects  see for instance refs. [11,12,14,15]. the second
pair is of the two-component type, and may play a role
in applications to condensed matter, as for instance in
the case investigated in refs. [4,37].

the one-component and the two-component type of
solutions also appear in magnetic materials [35]. there
they are known as ising and bloch walls, respectively.
the two-component bloch wall has a peculiar behavior,
that can be used to understand specic features of inter-
faces between magnetic domains. the issue here is that
if one looks at these solutions as vectors in the (, )
plane, for x spanning the interval (,) they describe
a straight line and an elliptical arc connection between
the two minima (1, 0), respectively, behaving very much
like linearly and elliptically polarized light. for this rea-
son, the block walls can be seen as chiral interfaces be-
tween domains with dierent magnetization, and this can
be used to describe the wall motion in magnetic materi-
als [38]. furthermore, these walls can be charged and we
may introduce charge by making the  eld complex, or
by coupling fermions to the system.

for / < 0 we have only two vacuum states. they are
(1, 0) and now we have a single topological sector, with
the same energy and topological charge obtained before,

4

a. the rst model

and

we consider the superpotential

w (1)(, ) =  +

1
3

3 + 2

(32)

where  and  are real parameters. this model was rst
investigated in ref. [2], but here we bring new results.
the equations of motion for static eld congurations
are given by

d2
dx2 = 22(2  1) + 22(2 +
d2
dx2 = 2(2  1) + 422 + 223

)2




(33)

(34)

these equations are solved by congurations that also
solve the pair of rst-order dierential equations

d
dx
d
dx

= (2  1) +  2
= 2   

(35)

(36)

solutions that solve these rst-order equations are bps
solutions.

this model has four absolute minima when / > 0,
and two minima when / < 0. for / > 0 the min-

ima are (1, 0) and (0,p/). topological solutions

are solutions that connect adjacent minima. thus, the
asymptotic behavior of the elds is governed by the set

for the corresponding sector. we notice that the rst pair
of solutions (40) and (41) solves the rst-order equations
even for / < 0. this one-component solution is still of
the bps type for / < 0, but now no topological defect
can be nested inside it. the reason is that for / < 0
the model presents no spontaneous symmetry breaking
in the independent  direction, and so it cannot support
topological defect in this  direction anymore.

for / > 0, there are non-bps solutions connecting

(0,p/) and (0,p/) by a straight line. to see this

explicitly we consider  = 0 in the specic system to get
the equation of motion for the static eld  = (x)

(x) =s 



tanh(p x)

(50)

the pair  = 0 and  in (50) is the pair of non-bps
solutions that we have already found. here, however,
we found the non-bps solution as an explicit solution
of the new rst-order dierential equations in systems of
coupled real scalar elds. although this is a non-bps
solution, we have already shown in sec. ii that its energy
is composed of equal portions of gradient (g) and po-
tential (p) contributions. in terms of densities we have,
explicitly

the solutions are



(cid:19) 

d2

dx2 = 22(cid:18)2 
(x) = s 



tanh(p x)

already presented in eq. (39).

the corresponding non-bps energy is (4/3)||p/, as

this model decouples for  = , as we have already
shown in ref. [12]. in this case the symmetry z2  z2
changes to the z4 one, but here a rotation by /4 changes
the model into two single-eld models. we also note
that for  = 2, the model decouples into two single-
eld systems, showing that the limit   /2 is also
uninteresting, at least from the point of view of models
of coupled scalar eld.

we expose other features of the model using w (1). we

write

w (1)

 = 2, w (1)

 = 2, w (1)

 = 2

and

(46)

we see that w (1) is harmonic when   . this means
that the model admits another pair of rst-order equa-
tions. this pair follows from (23) and (24)

(44)

g1(x) = p1(x) =

1
2

2sech4(cid:16)p x(cid:17)

(51)

we can now understand this feature by realizing that
although this pair of solutions is non-bps, in the reduced
system where   0, the  eld solution is indeed a bps
solution.

(45)

b. the second model

we consider another model, dened by the superpo-

tential

w (2)(, ) = (2  1)

(52)

this model was also considered in ref. [28]. the equa-
tions of motion are

2
t2 

2
x2 + 22(2  1) + 422 = 0

2
t2 

2
x2 + 422 = 0

(53)

(54)

for static elds the energy is minimized for congura-
tions that obey the rst-order equations

d
dx
d
dx

= 2

=   2  2

(47)

(48)

d
dx
d
dx

= 2

= (2  1)

(55)

(56)

these equations also furnish solutions to the equations of
motion, for   . as we have already seen, for  
 the model presents a single topological sector, already
investigated. but we notice that w (1) is also harmonic
in the limit   0, independently of the parameters 
and . we use this into the above eqs. (47) and (48) to
get  = 0 and

d
dx

= (cid:18)2 



(cid:19)

(49)

the model presents two vacuum states, given by
(1, 0). in contraposition with the former model, how-
ever, this new model presents no bps sector, because the
function (52) obeys w (2)(2 = 1, ) = 0, and then gives
|w (2)| = 0. this means that the rst-order equations
(55) and (56) present no topological solutions connecting
the two vacuum states. on the other hand, the vacuum
states (1, 0) can be connected by topological but non-
bps solutions. the explicit form of the solutions is given
by

we consider  > 0. in this case the above equation is
easily solved to give

(x) =  tanh( x)
(x) = 0

(57)
(58)

5

the energy or tension of the solution is

t2
nbp s = (4/3)||

(59)

this result reproduces the value presented by the similar
one-component bps solution (40) and (41) of the rst
model.

we compare this model with the rst one to see that
it provides a nice way to understand how the bps and
non-bps solutions behave. we notice that

w (2)

 = 2, w (2)

 = 0, w (2)

 = 2

(60)

there is only one way to make w (2) harmonic, which
implies setting   0. the new rst-order equations
correspond to the equations (23) and (24) for w (2), in
the limit   0. they give

d
dx

= (2  1)

this is solved by

(x) =  tanh(x)

(61)

(62)

the pair of solutions formed by  = 0 and  as in eq. (62)
is the pair of non-bps solutions that we have already
found for this model. this is another example where one
gets non-bps solutions as solutions to rst-order dier-
ential equations. this is perhaps the most natural way
of understanding why this non-bps solution has energy
evenly distributed into its gradient and potential por-
tions. in terms of energy densities we have

g2(x) = p2(x) =

1
2

2sech4( x)

(63)

c. the third model

let us now consider another model, dened by the su-

perpotential

w (3)(, ) =  +

1
3

3  2

this model has the rst-order equations

d
dx
d
dx

=  + 2  2
= 2

(64)

(65)

(66)

the model has only two minima, and for / > 0 they

are (p/, 0). they give

w (3)(p/, 0) = 

s 



2
3

(67)

6

and dene a bps sector. the explicit bps solution is
given by

(x) = s 



tanh(cid:16)p x(cid:17) ,

(68)

together with  = 0. we deal with the rst-order equa-
tions to get

(cid:18)2 


 

1
3

2(cid:19) = 0

(69)

this restriction constrains the orbits in the (, ) plane
in such a way that no nite orbit can connect the two
minima, unless in the case  = 0, in which one repro-
duces the topological solution just obtained. this model
has a single topological sector, and presents no family of
topological solutions, like the family (42) and (43) ob-
tained in the rst model.
we use w (3) to obtain

w (3)

 = 2, w (3)

 = 2, w (3)

 = 2

(70)

we see that w (3) is harmonic. this means that we have
another pair of rst-order equations that come from (23)
and (24). it is

d
dx
d
dx

= 2

=   2 + 2

(71)

(72)

we think of this pair as appearing from another function,

(73)

3 + 2

the former sector was explicitly constructed.

fw (3) =  

fw (3), as dened in the eqs. (26) and (27). we get
we notice thatfw (3) vanishes along the line  = 0 where
we can use fw (3) to write fw (3)
andfw (3)
 = 2, showing thatfw (3) is also harmonic, as
complex superpotential w (3) = w (3) + ifw (3) and the

 = 2,fw (3)

complex eld  =  + i. we change notation and write

expected. as we have suggested in sec. ii, we use the

 = 2,

w2() =  

1
3

3

(74)

as the superpotential of the third model. the new no-
tation uses the subscript n in wn to identify the com-
plex superpotential that presents the zn symmetry  see
sec. v b for further details. we use w2 to get, in the vac-
uum states k, k = 1, 2

w2( 1) =

we use this result to obtain the tensions

iv. stability

(108)

(109)

in this sec. iv we deal with issues concerning stability
of the topological solutions in (1, 1) dimensions. we fol-
low ref. [15], recalling that the linear stability also shows
how the bosonic elds behave in the background of the
classical solutions. we examine linear stability for two
coupled real scalar elds using (x, t) = (x) + (x, t)
and (x, t) = (x) + (x, t). here

these operators allow writing h1 = ss, where h1 is
the hamiltonian corresponding to the rst model

h1 = 1

(119)

this factorization h1 = ss shows that h1 is positive
semi-denite, and so can have no negative eigenvalue. we
then conclude that the bps solutions are stable, since
they solve the rst-order equations we need to get the
rst-order operators (117) and (118).

in this rst model, the one-component solutions can
be solved explicitly. for the bps pair (40) and (41) we
get the following set of discrete eigenvalues: in the rst
direction, the  direction

(x, t) =xn
(x, t) =xn

let us now consider the second model. for the pair
of non-bps solutions given by eqs. (57) and (58) we get
the following set of eigenvalues for the bound states, in
the rst direction

w(2,1)

in the second direction we have

w(2,2)

w(2,2)

=q[(317  5)/2]2

let us now consider the third model. we use the pair
obtained with (68) and  = 0 to obtain for the bound
states the set of eigenvalues, in the rst direction

w(3,1)

0

= 0,

w(3,1)

1

and, in the second direction

=p3

this pair of solutions represents a straight line orbit in

the (, ) plane, connecting the two vacua (1,p1/3).
we consider stability of the above solutions. here the
uctuations decouple and we obtain
u11 = 92[4  6 sech2(3x)]
u22 = 92(cid:18) 8

9(cid:19)(cid:20)1 + tanh(3x)

the rst potential u11 is the modied posch-teller po-
tential. it presents two bound states, with energies

w0 = 0,

w1 = 332

(134)

the second potential u22 is not reectionless. it supports
no bound state, and the continuum starts at zero energy.

v. further considerations

the models investigated above present similar bps
and non-bps solutions. they provide concrete ways of
investigating how the scalar elds behave in the back-
ground of bps and non-bps solutions. we explore some
possibilities in the next sec. v a. in sec. v b we investi-
gate intersection of defects.

a. entrapment of the other eld

in the rst model, we can further understand the im-
portance of the topological solutions by investigating the
potential v1(, ). it is given by

v1(, ) =

1
2

2(2  1)2 + (2  1)2
1
24 + 2222
+
2

(135)

this model presents the one-component bps solution
(40) and (41). we have 2 = 1 outside the bps de-
fect, and  = 0 at x = 0, at the center of the defect. we
then use v1(, ) to get

2(cid:18)2 
v1(  0, ) =
v1(2  1, ) = 222 +

we cannot present explicit investigations concerning
stability of solutions of the fourth model, because we do
not know any explicit solution in this case. however,
we consider stability of the solutions of another model,
introduced in ref. [24]. this model is dened by the
superpotential

w (, ) = r 4

3!2
   +r 1

27  +r 1
3!3
3!2
+  +r 1

(129)

the system presents the three minima (0,p4/3) and
(1,p1/3). they give three bps sectors, having ener-
to the sector connecting the minima (1,p1/3). this

gies ||, 3 ||, and 4 ||. the highest energy is associated
is the only sector where we can nd explicit solutions.
they are given by

(x) =  tanh(3 x)

(x) = p1/3

(130)

(131)

9

for / > 0 the potential (136) shows the presence of
spontaneous symmetry breaking in the independent 
direction in the (, ) plane.
in this case the  eld
presents squared masses given by

m2
(in) = 4
(out) = 42
m2

(138)

(139)

where in and out identify the region inside and outside
the defect. we see that the ratio of masses is

m2
m2

(in)
(out)

=




(140)

here we have

v2( = 0, ) =

1
2

2

v2(2 = 1, ) = 222

(143)

(144)

this ratio identies the region 0 < / < 1 in the space
of parameters where the eld  entraps the other eld.
for a given , we see that the parameter  controls the
ratio of squared masses. thus, the eciency of the en-
trapment depends on .

this model can be used as a bag model [29], similar
to the models in refs. [30,31]. here we can further en-
large the model by changing dimensions from (1, 1) to
(3, 1) and making the  eld complex, going from the
z2  z2 symmetry to the z2  u (1). however, since in-
side the defect formed by (x), the  eld still engenders
spontaneous symmetry breaking for  > 0, we can only
circumvent the presence of goldstone bosons when one
gauge the related u (1) symmetry, making it local. the
model that emerges presents the symmetry z2  ul(1).
since we started in (3, 1) dimensions, inside the wall the
theory is eectively (2, 1) dimensional. this is an al-
ternate mechanism for dimensional reduction, and inside
the wall the eective theory may very naturally develop
the callan-harvey eect [40], if one appropriately cou-
ples fermions to the second eld, . this scenario seems
to appear interesting, and we shall further explore this
possibility in a separate report.

the rst model is simpler for  < 0.

in this case,
spontaneous symmetry breaking no longer appear inside
the wall formed by the  eld. however, the wall is still
of the bps type. the potential v1(, ) changes in a way
such that the ratio (140) becomes

m2
m2

(in)
(out)


2

= 

(141)

this result shows that the topological defect generated
by  can still entrap  mesons for 0 > / > 2, acting
like a bag for the elementary excitations of the eld . if
we change the symmetry z2  z2 to z2  u (1) by mak-
ing the  eld complex, in this case we do not need to
make the u (1) symmetry local, and we can still explore
the presence of a global symmetry within the wall. work
in this direction was already presented in ref. [41], in
a model inspired in the work of ref. [6], with a poten-
tial that diers from the one here proposed. we believe
that our model may give further insight into the issues
that arise in this scenario. further applications can be
done, as for instance in ref. [42], where one explores the
presence of diuse domain walls at intersecting at di-
rections within the cosmological scenario. also, we can
follow ref. [43] to investigate issues concerning hybrid in-
ation, envolving features that requires at least two real
scalar elds, the inaton eld and another one, which is
in general used to break the symmetry.

the second model is dened with the superpotential

(52). it gives the potential

v2(, ) =

1
2

2(2  1)2 + 2222

(142)

thus the squared masses associated to the  eld are

m2
(in) = 0
(out) = 42
m2

(145)

(146)

in this case the non-bps defect always entraps the eld
, acting like a bag for the elementary  excitations.
here, however, the  meson is massless inside the bag.
this shows that the entrapment is more ecient in this
model, although the basic solution, the bag, is of the
non-bps type.

we can investigate the third model similarly. it is de-

ned by the superpotential (64) and we have

v3(, ) =

1
2

2(cid:18)2 



(cid:19)2

 2(cid:18)2 



(cid:19) 2

+

24 + 2222

(147)

2

we can write, for / > 0,



1
2

v3(0, ) =

2(cid:18)2 +

(cid:19)2
v3(p/, ) = 22 +

(148)

(149)

1
2

24

no spontaneous symmetry breaking appears inside the
-defect anymore, and so the model cannot support de-
fect inside defect. however, the squared masses of the
elementary  mesons are

m2
m2

(in) = 2
(out) = 4

we get the ratio

m2
m2

(in)

(out)

=

1
2

(150)

(151)

(152)

this ratio does not depend on the parameters  and ,
but the topological defect may also entrap  mesons.
this is another model, in which the topological state may
simulate a bag to entrap the elementary excitations of the
other eld. in this case, however, the eciency of the en-
trapment can no longer be controlled by the parameters
that denes the model.

the second and third models may also be immersed
in the (3, 1) dimensional space-time. this immersion
provide alternative ways to investigate the behavior of
the current generated by making the second eld com-
plex, as commented above. they give similar scenarios

10

for charged walls, and may present distinct physical con-
tents.

other applications include the diverse issues recently
investigated in refs. [1215,27,44]. we can, for instance,
enlarge the models in order to break the symmetry
and/or the supersymmetry. this possibility may give rise
to fermi balls [27], fermi disks [14], and other charged
objects [44], which depend on the particular space-time
dimension one starts with, and on the parameters that
dene the terms added to allow the symmetry breaking.
we can also follow refs. [12,13,15] to extend the scenario
of nested defects to the case of nested network of defects.
this picture follows as a direct generalization of the re-
sult of ref. [15], which shows explicitly that defects may
nest defects if the model engenders the z2z2 symmetry
in systems of two real scalar elds. as we are going to
see below, to have intersection of defects we must neces-
sarily enlarge the z2 symmetry to at least the z3 one.
for this reason, we can think of a model that presents
the z2  z3 symmetry, composed of three real scalar
elds, one presenting the z2 symmetry, and the other
two controlling the z3 symmetry. in (3, 1) space-time di-
mensions the rst eld engenders the z2 symmetry, and
we can certainly get to the case where it may give rise
to a domain wall, which may nest the two other elds
in its interior. within this scenario, if the z3 symmetry
related to the second and third elds is still eective we
may nest a planar network of defects inside domain walls.
we take advantage of the model investigated in ref. [24]
to present a model that seems to work correctly. this
model is dened by

v (, , ) =

2(cid:18)2 
2
 22 (2 + 2)
3
+2(2 + 2)2  2(2  32)

(153)

it behaves standardly in (3, 1) space-time dimensions and
is such that v () = v (, 0, 0) obeys

v () =

2
3

2(cid:18)2 

9

4(cid:19)2

(154)

we consider that the eld  = (x) depends only on x.
thus, it supports bps defects with the explicit form

3
2

tanh(cid:16)3  x(cid:17)

(x) = 

(155)
the corresponding energy density is 33 2. we also
notice that the potentials vin(, ) = v (0, , ) and
vout(, ) = v (3/2, , ) are such that

vin(, ) =

27
8

2 + 2(2 + 2)2  2(2  32)

and

(156)

11

vout(, ) = 2(2 + 2)2  2(2  32)

2(2 + 2)

(157)

4



we see that the z3 symmetry of the pair of elds (, ) is
preserved both inside and outside the domain wall gener-
ated by the rst eld, . in the region inside the domain
wall, vin(, ) has minima at the points

(cid:18) 3

, 0(cid:19) , (cid:18)

,

(158)

in this case the squared masses are m2

an ecient mechanism for the entrapment of the pair of
elds (, ) in this model. we shall further explore this
and other related issues in another work.

(out) = m2

b. intersection of defects

the process of intersection of defects was already ex-
plored in ref. [20], in the case of supersymmetric eld
theories. there, the basic idea was to show that the
intersection of two extended objects is energetically ad-
missible when it can be seen as a reaction that occurs
exothermically. this may be translated into the expres-
sion tik < tij + tjk, where tik, tij , and tjk are the ener-
gies or tensions associated to the fusion of the two de-
fects, and to the individuals defects, respectively. the
crucial point here is that in supersymmetric theories the
topological charge t of the defect appears as a central
charge, and for bps states one gets t = |t |. if one uses
tij = |tij|, tjk = |tjk|, and tik = |tij + tjk| the triangle
inequality tik  tij + tjk follows naturally. this triangle
inequality is strictly valid in supersymmetric systems de-
scribed by complex superpotentials, whose values at the
vacuum states dene points in the complex plane, not
aligned into a straight-line segment.

the fourth model is the supersymmetric model that
opens the possibility for the presence of stable intersec-
tion of extended objects, giving rise to a triple junction
of bps states, as recently shown in ref. [21]  see also
refs. [22,23]. this model was considered in sec iii d, and

the basic model is given by   (1/4) 4. here, however,
we consider the case

wn =   

1

n + 1

 (n +1)

(162)

with  and  real parameters. this model presents the
zn symmetry. the vacuum states are singular points of
the superpotential. they obey n = /, and the n
solutions are, using  = an  with a real and positive,

k = a e2i[(k1)/n ], k = 1, 2, ..., n.

(163)

the topological sectors connect pairs of adjacent vacua,
and in general the number of bps sectors is n (n  1)/2.
their energies or tensions are given in terms of the values
of the superpotential in the singular points, that is

t(n )
ij = |wn ( i)  wn ( j )|

(164)

the tensions can be classied according to the integer n,
n = 1, 2, ..., [n/2], where [n/2] stands for the greatest
integer not greater than n/2 itself. these tensions have
the explicit values

t(n )
n =

n a(n +1)

n + 1 ||r2h1  cos(cid:16)2

n

n(cid:17)i

(165)

the integer n identies topological sectors described via
the connection between a given vacuum, and its n  th
neighbor: n = 1 for connections between rst neighbors,
n = 2 for second neighbors, and so forth. we can check
that these tensions are ordered in the form t(n )
k < t(n )
k+1,
for k = 1, ..., < [n/2], and n  4. this order also shows
that the direct connection between two vacuum states is
always less energetic than any other possible connection.
for instance, t(n )

t(n )

it presents the z3 symmetry, but it is described by a
potential that cannot be written in terms of some super-
potential. in this case the key issue relies on nding a
way out of supersymmetry to show that the fusion of de-
fects still occurs exothermically. in the supersymmetric
case one can use interesting properties to make the rea-
soning naturally simple. in the non-supersymmetric case,
however, we have found non-bps solutions that presents
the interesting property of having gradient and poten-
tial portions of the energy evenly distributed to compose
the total energy of the defect. as we have shown, such
a property is also shared by all the bps solutions, and
so we can use it to present a new reasoning, that works

within and beyond the context of supersymmetry. the
reasoning follows from the topological current presented
in eq. (30). here we have

(x) =(cid:18)(x)

thus t = 2g(x), and for static solutions that presents
equal gradient and potential portions we get t = g(x)+
p(x) = (x), or better

tij =z

(168)

we consider fusion of two defects in the model investi-
gated in ref. [24]. the topological defects there obtained
obey g(x) = p(x). thus, we can use

(ij + jk)t(ij + jk) = t

jkjk

ij ij + t

(169)

also, we take advantage of the symmetry of the model to
see that if the pair (, ) represents a solution in a given
sector, all the other solutions can be obtained by rotating
the solution according to the z3 symmetry. this means
that we can write

ij(x)

(cid:18)
ij (x)(cid:19) =(cid:18) cos( ij )

 sin( ij )



sin( ij )

cos( ij )(cid:19)(cid:18)(x)

(x)(cid:19) (170)

here  ij is the angle between the given solution (, )
and the solution (ij , ij). in the z3 model under con-
sideration ij can only be 2/3 and 4/3. we now use
(168), (169), and (170) to obtain tik < tij + tjk. this
result shows that the three-junction in the model under
consideration occurs exothermically.

vi. networks of defects

the recent refs. [2123] have introduced investigations
concerning defect junctions and networks in supersym-
metric systems, and now we turn our attention to this
possibility. we consider junctions in the plane, which
may give rise to planar networks of defects. to imple-
ment this possibility we work in the (2, 1) space-time, in
the plane (x, y). we identify the axes (x, y) with the axes
(, ) of the space of congurations. we illustrate this
situation by considering the model dened by the poten-
tial in eq. (166). the topological solutions in the planar
case are [24]

they may be used to represent the three-junction in the
thin wall approximation.

let us consider the rst model, in the case / > 0.

of the bps and non-bps sectors are t1

the minima are at v1 = (1, 0), v2 = (0,p/), v3 =
(1, 0), and v4 = (0,p/). the energies or tensions

bp s =
nbp s = (4/3)||. for a given , the value of
 allows obtaining three distinct situations. the rst
concerns the case  > . in this case the minima give
rise to an array of defects of the form shown in fig. 1,
in the thin wall approximation.

fig. 1. a possible array of defects, as suggested by the
rst model of sec. iii a in the case of / < 1. the vacuum
states are represented by v1 = 1, v2 = 2, v3 = 3, and v4 = 4,
and the thinner and thicker lines stand for bps and non-bps
defects, respectively.

the second case concerns  = , and the third one
 < . in the thin wall approximation they are shown
in fig. 2, and in fig. 3, respectively. the second case
seems to give an intersection of four half-defects, but this
is not true since for  =  the two elds decouple. thus,
the apparent intersection of four half-defects represents
in fact the uninteresting case of two non-intersecting de-
fects.

the rst and third cases seem to be dual to each other,
since they are linked by the interchange   . this
duality is very much like the s  t duality that the dia-
grams depicted in fig. 1 and in fig. 3 remember. this
scenario excludes the self-dual case, where  = .

the basic diagrams of fig. 1 and fig. 3 can be used to
generate planar networks of defects. we can generate a

13

network in the two following ways. the s-network, which
appears for / < 1, and the t-network, for / > 1.
they are depicted in fig. 4 and in fig. 5, in the case of
regular hexagonal networks in the thin wall approxima-
tion. in the rst case we impose that the triangle with
vertices v1, v2, v4 is equilateral. this gives / = 1/3.
in the second case we impose that the triangle with ver-
tices v1, v2, v3 is equilateral. it gives / = 3, the result
we should expect from duality. we notice that the rst
(second) imposition subdivides the distance between the
horizontal (vertical) vacua into three equal pieces, which
is the condition for the formation of a network of regular
hexagons.

for  = 3, we have two sides of the hexagon formed
bp s. the
other four sides are formed by bps states, with tension
(1/2)t1
bp s. for  = (1/3), two sides of the hexagon are
formed by bps states, with tension t1
bp s, and the other
four sides are also formed by bps states, with tension
(1/2) t1

bp s.

we think of a planar network of defects. we notice
that a t-network means / > 1, and this allows hexag-
onal networks with two distinct bps states, having two
dierent tensions, t1
bp s, show-
ing that each three-junction of this t-network is at the
threshold of stability. for / < 1, in the case of s-
networks, however, the situation is dierent since now

bp s = (1/2)t1

bp s and t 1

we must have two non-bps states to build the hexago-
nal cell. since the ratio / < 1 controls the energy of
the non-bps state, every three-junction may obey the
inequality tij < tjk + tki.

nbp s = t 1

we can consider the case where t1

bp s. this
gives  = 4  and the tensions degenerate to the single
value (2/3)||. the hexagonal cell is no longer regular.
the angle between the two bps states changes from  =
120 to  = 2 , where  is slightly lesser than 63.5 degrees.
we notice that we cannot make the tensions and angles
degenerate simultaneously, and this indicates instability
of the suggested networks.

eects that contribute to stabilize the network may
appear when we go beyond the classical level and intro-
duce the quantum corrections, since the quantum con-
tributions may modify the classical scenario. for in-
stance, in the case / > 1, in a t-network all the defects
are bps defects, and their energies or tensions are pro-
tected against receiving quantum corrections. on the

other hand, for / < 1, in the case of a s-network there
are non-bps states whose tensions are not protected and
may receive quantum corrections, changing the classical
value t1

nbp s, contributing to stabilize the network.

the rst model does not allow the appearence of a net-
work of planar squares, although squares can also ll the
plane. in our model this would require the z4 symmetry,
which is not eective in that model.

the fourth model leads to the model considered in
refs. [21,22]. in this case the three-junction is formed by
bps defects, and we can form an hexagonal array. here,
the three-junction is stable, because each leg carries the
same tension. but it does not generate a bps network,
since any two adjacent three-junctions must have dier-
ent winding to accomodate the three vacuum states in
the network, and this would imply that each side of the
hexagonal cell must be seen as bps and anti-bps, simul-
taneously, frustrating and destabilizing the network  see
refs. [2123].

fig. 6. the regular hexagonal network of non-bps defects
given by the z3 model dened by the potential of eq. (166).

we consider another model, investigated in ref. [24].
this model is dened by no superpotential, and the argu-
ment above is no longer valid. the z3 symmetry seems
to allow the presence of a network of defects, also in the
form of regular hexagonal array. in the thin wall approx-
imation, the hexagonal network that appears in this case
is interesting because the solutions are explicitly known,
form straight-line segments joining the vacuum states,

and have the same energy or tension, (9/4)p27/8||.

the z3 symmetry that appears in the vacuum sectors
is also eective in the sectors of the topological defects.
the inequality tik  tij + tjk is strictly valid in this case,
ensuring stability of the hexagonal network, as depicted
in fig. 6 in the thin wall approximation.

vii. comments and conclusions

in the present work we have examined several mod-
els of coupled scalar elds. we have found some explicit

14

solutions, of the bps and non-bps type. we have also
investigated linear stability, checking the behavior of the
bosonic matter on the background of the bps and non-
bps defects. the bps states are solutions that obey
rst-order dierential equations, and the non-bps states
are not. the bps states engender the property of having
energy evenly distributed in the gradient and potential
portions. however, in the systems of two coupled elds
that we have introduced, the non-bps states also engen-
der the same feature, as we have explicitly shown in this
work. the point here is that the non-bps states of the
systems of coupled elds are bps states of simpler sys-
tems, which are projections of systems of coupled elds
onto a single, specic eld direction.

the rst model is the model investigated in sec. iii a.
it presents several properties. in particular, it has a rich
bps sector, the sector that connect the minima (1, 0)
and (-1,0) by one-component and two-component bps
states. the two-component state describe a family of so-
lutions, parametrized by the ratio between the coupling
constants that specify the system. these one-component
and two-component states allow diverse applications, like
the applications as bag models in refs. [27], as defects in-
side defects in refs. [11,12,14,15], and in applications to
condensed matter, to polimeric chains having two rel-
evant degrees of freedom to represent the chain  see
refs. [4,37].

in applications in the form of bag models, in addi-
tion to the models already introduced in refs. [30,31] we
have other possibilities, given by the rst, second and
third models introduced in sec. iii. these models dif-
fer from the model considered in ref. [41], and we be-
lieve that this new direction may shed further light on
the issues explored in that work. in particular, it seems
that our suggestions are easier to examine, and may oer
an analytical understanding of the issues put forward in
ref. [41] under numerical investigations. we recall that
the model investigated in [41] is dened by a potential
that cannot be reduced to none of the models considered
in the present work.

in application to defect inside defect, much work was
already done in refs. [1115]. the natural extension is
now related to issues where one allows the presence of lo-
cal symmetries, as in the work on superconducting strings
[6]. in the rst model of sec iii the z2  z2 symmetry
can be enlarged by enlarging each one of the two inde-
pendent symmetries. as we have already commented on
in sec. iii, we can for instance make the  eld complex,
in this case changing the z2z2 symmetry to z2ul(1),
if one also includes the abelian gauge eld. this opens
new possibilities, providing for instance a natural sce-
nario to the callan-harvey eect [40]. another possibil-
ity includes models that presents the z2  z3 symmetry,
which may provide scenarios for domain walls that nest
planar networks of topological defects. these issues are
presently under consideration, and we hope to report on
them in the near future.

we have also commented on junctions of defects, and

the subsequent formation of networks of defects. in this
case we need to enlarge the spatial dimension from d = 1
to at least the d = 2 case. in the planar case, we have
exemplifyed how to get planar solutions from the unidi-
mensional kinks of the model. here we have considered
three models, the rst and the fourth model of sec. iii,
and another one, rstly considered in ref. [24]. these
systems are all dierent: the rst model admits a super-
symmetric extension of the type n = 1, and seems to
admit no stable network of defects, at least classically;
the fourth model presents junctions that break 1/4 su-
persymmetry, but it also seems to admit no stable net-
work of bps defects. the other model does not present
a supersymmetric extension, but the defect solutions get
even contributions from the gradient and potential por-
tions of the energy, and so they behave very much like
bps states. this is crucial for showing that the fusion of
defects is a reaction that occurs exothermically, and so
the three-junction generates a stable network of defects.
