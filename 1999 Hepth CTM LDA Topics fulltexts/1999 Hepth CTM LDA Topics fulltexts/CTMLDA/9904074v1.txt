(april 1999)

the quantum stress tensor in the unruh state for a conformal scalar propagating in a 4d
schwarzschild black hole spacetime is reconstructed in its leading behaviour at innity and near
the horizon by means of an eective action derived by functionally integrating the trace anomaly.

in the mid-seventies hawking [1] showed that black
holes are quantum mechanically unstable: they decay by
the emission of thermal radiation at a temperature in-
versely proportional to their mass, i.e. th = (8m )1
in units where h = c = g = kb = 1. this is one of
the most astonishing discoveries of theoretical physics in
the second half of the century. nowadays black hole ra-
diation and its thermodynamical implications, most no-
tably bekenstein-hawking area-entropy formula [2], are
among the consistency tests any candidate of quantum
gravity theory has to successfully pass in order to be se-
riously considered. notwithstanding decades of intensive
studies, the evolution and fate of an evaporating black
hole (ebh) are still unknown. in the opinion of many
people the nal answer to this issue has to wait until a
complete and self consistent quantum gravity theory has
been found. string theory appears as the most promis-
ing candidate to achieve this goal and many eorts have
been devoted to show their compatibility with black hole
radiation. however, one is still far away to understand,
within string theory, how do black holes evaporate.
a more traditional eld theoretical approach to the evo-
lution of black holes driven by the quantum uctua-
tions of the matter elds relies on the eective action
sef f (g). this is the so called backreaction, which in
mathematical terms is governed by the semiclassical ein-
stein equations

g(g) = 8ht (g)i ,

(1)

where g is the einstein tensor for the metric g and

ht(g)i =

2

g

sef f (g)

g

(2)

is the renormalized expectation value of the stress energy
tensor operator for the matter elds propagating on g.
a quantum state and boundary conditions appropriate
to black hole evaporation have to be supplied to eq. (1).

the framework is quantum eld theory in curved space-
time [3], a semiclassical approach in which only the
matter elds are quantized, whereas gravity is still de-
scribed classically according to einsteins general rel-
ativity. one expects this approximation to be consis-
tent until the size of the ebh becomes comparable to
the planck length (1033cm). at this point one has to
move to a genuine quantum gravity theory which unfor-
tunately is still lacking. even within semiclassical grav-
ity, however, the evolution of an ebh is hard to follow
simply because the relevant eective action sef f (g) is
not explicitly known. the only informations available for
black hole evaporation come from analytical estimates
of hti for matter elds propagating in a xed static
schwarzschild black hole geometry of a given mass m .
selecting a mode basis suitable for black hole evapora-
tion (unruh modes [4] ) the matter elds are expanded
in that basis, canonically quantized and then hti is di-
rectly calculated by modes sum and point splitting reg-
ularization of the divergences.
note that the schwarzschild spacetime

ds2 = f dt2 + f 1dr2 + r2(d2 + sin2 d2),

(3)
where f = 1  2m/r, does not satisfy the semiclassical
einstein equations (1) being the l.h.s.
identically van-
ishing unlike the r.h.s. . however one can still regard a
schwarzschild black hole as a sort of zero order (in the
hole luminosity) approximation to a real ebh.
the mode basis relevant for quantization are chosen in
the following way:
i) in modes are positive frequency with respect to
minkowsky time t;
ii) out modes are positive frequency with respect to
kruskal u = 4m eu/4m , the ane parameter along
the past horizon.
the quantum state so dened is called the unruh state.
by condition i) this state reduces to the usual minkowski
in vacuum asymptotically in the past (i.e. no incoming

1

radiation). the condition ii) mimics the modes coming
out from a collapsing star as its surface approaches the
event horizon, as shown in hawkings original analysis
[1].
hti in the unruh state has the following leading be-
haviour at innity [5] (only the nonzero components are
shown)

r2-term does not show up. finally, the numerical co-
ecients a, b, c depend on the matter species considered
[3]. the anomaly induced eective action is related to
the trace anomaly by functional integration of

l = 2.197 104

describing an inux down the hole of negative energy ra-
diation which compensates the ux escaping at innity.
from these results one expects black holes to evaporate
at a rate of order m 2. the evolution is then modelled
as a sequence of schwarzschild black holes with the mass
parameter m decreasing along the sequence at the above
rate. this should hold at least to zero order.
to go beyond this naive scheme one should directly at-
tack the semiclassical einstein equations: nd ht (g)i
for a suciently general (i.e. time dependent) ebh ge-
ometry g and solve eqs. (1) for the geometry. this
for the moment remains a dream since, as said before,
sef f (g) and hence ht (g)i are not known.
signicant simplications occur when the matter elds
one is considering are conformal invariant, since then at
least part of sef f (g) can be reconstructed from the
trace anomaly [3]. we shall call this part anomaly in-
duced eective action, i.e. sef f
an .
at the classical level conformal invariance of the matter
elds action implies vanishing trace of the correspond-
ing energy momentum tensor. at the quantum level, on
the other hand, the renormalization procedure induces a
nonvanishing expectation value of the trace which does
not depend on the quantum state in which the expec-
tation value is taken. this trace anomaly is expressed
completely in terms of geometrical objects [3]

an to be determined up to a weyl

this operation allows sef f
invariant functional.
the basic question we would like to address in this paper
is whether sef f
an by itself is suciently accurate to repro-
duce the basic properties of black hole evaporation and
can therefore be used in the semiclassical einstein equa-
tions (1) to get some insight in the backreaction problem.
to answer this question we shall explicitly test sef f
an in
a specic example where results can be obtained in an
independent way, namely a massless scalar eld in the
unruh state propagating on a schwarzschild black hole
geometry. for this system we already know from our pre-
vious discussion the expected leading behaviour of hti
at innity and near the horizon (see eqs. (4), (5) ).
we shall now proceed to show that, with appropriate
boundary conditions, sef f
an does indeed lead to a ux of
radiation at innity emitted by the schwarzschild black
hole in agreement with eqs. (4), (5).
we shall work with the following local form of sef f

we remark that the origin of the trace anomaly is the
renormalization of the action of vacuum in a theory of
conformal invariant matter elds, that is why in (6) the

and l1 is an arbitrary parameter not determined by the
theory. after elimination of the auxiliary elds  and 
this expression reduces to the well known nonlocal form
given by reigert [8] only if l1 = a
. for other values

of l1 this no longer happens. the dierence, however, is
a conformal invariant functional which, as said, cannot
be determined from the trace anomaly alone.
from eq. (8) the equations of motion for the auxiliary

where z  (k1 + k2) + l1 and the dots indicate terms
containing either the ricci tensor r or the ricci scalar
r. since for our subsequent analysis these terms vanish
identically, they are not written in detail.
the procedure we shall adopt is to solve the equations of
motion (10) and (11) for the auxiliary elds in the back-
ground schwarzschild geometry, insert then these solu-
tions for  and  in hti of eq. (13) and compare the
results with the expected expressions eqs. (4), (5).
the problem we immediately have to face in trying to
follow the above scheme is how to dene in our frame-
work the unruh state, since the trace anomaly and hence
sef f
an do not make any reference to a particular quantum
state. note, however, that the solution of the auxiliary
eld equation (10) (and similarly for eq.
(11) ) is de-
termined up to a solution of the homogeneous equation
4 = 0. it is through this solution that the state de-
pendence will be encoded.
the boundary conditions that characterize the unruh
vacuum which follow from its denition (see i) and ii))
are:
a) no incoming radiation from innity;
b) hti should be regular on the future event horizon
(in a free falling frame) .
furthemore in the unruh state thti = 0.
the homogeneous solutions of the auxiliary elds equa-
tion of motion have to implement these boundary condi-
tions in our system if we want to correctly describe black
hole evaporation.
the solution for  can be given in the following general
form (r, t) = dt + w(r), where

48m 2(cid:19) r3  (2m )3
3r(r  2m )(cid:21)

and we have dened   48(k1+k2). a, b, c, d are con-
stants that specify the homogeneous solution. the choice
of a linear t dependence appearing in eq. (14) is the fol-
lowing. in the unruh state htrti 6= 0 and this requires our
eld  to have a time dependence otherwise htrti would
vanish identically. however any time dependence dier-
ent from the linear one would imply an explicit time de-
pendence of hti , which contradicts thti = 0. any
,  dependence is forbidden by spherical symmetry.
one can express the solution for the other auxiliary
eld  in a similar form with the obvious replacements
    48l1, (a, b, c, d)  (a, b, c, d). substitut-
ing the solutions for the auxiliary elds  and  in eq.
(13) one obtains the stress tensor hti. we symbolically
write

hti = ht()i + ht()i

(15)

dividing the contribution of each individual auxiliary eld
to the stress tensor. the boundary conditions a) and b)
will be imposed on ht()i and ht ()i separately and
the physical reason for this will become clear at the end
of our analysis.
being the calculation of hti rather lengthy and boring
we shall report, here, only the basic results. a detailed
analysis and discussion will be reported in a forthcoming
publication [9].
the (r, t) component is the most simple to write and
reads

ht r

t ()i =

r2 ,

(16)

as expected from the conservation equations ht 
 i =
0 in the schwarzschild spacetime under the hypothesis
thti = 0 [10].

not on the future).

it is remarkable that these expressions are exactly the
required form of eqs. (4), (5) if we set l
before proceeding to a numerical comparison, it is rather
illuminating to examine the analytic structure of the aux-
iliary elds once the arbitrary constants (a, b, c, d) and
(a, b, c, d) are xed according to our unruh state con-
ditions a) and b). as r  2m we nd that the condition
e = 2dm makes  linear in v, i.e.   dv + const.
which is regular on the future horizon, but singular on
the past horizon. on the other hand b = 0 and d = a/2
yields   u at innity describing outgoing radiation.
the same can be said for . note that this behaviour
emerges only as a consequence of imposing a) and b) sep-
arately on ht ()i and ht()i. now, these auxiliary
elds are related to the inverse of the fourth order op-
erator 4 appearing in the nonlocal form of the action
(8). by our choice of constants we have therefore found
the boundary conditions appropriate to the description
of black hole evaporation.
we come now to the numerology. as said before, l1
is an arbitrary parameter of our model.
if it is cho-
sen such that sef f
(8) reduces to the reigert
action [8] , i.e.
, inserting the appropriate
values for one scalar eld (a = 1/120 , b = 1/360 ) we
nd l =  1
(24m)2 which is negative. this is physically
meaningless. this result is analogous to the one found
for minimally coupled scalar elds classically reduced to
2d under spherical symmetry [11]. on the other hand if
l1 = 0 which means, by our choice of constants,  = 0
(i.e. the conformally invariant part of sef f
an is completely
720m 2 which diers by a factor
removed) one gets l =
of 6 from the result [6]. the matching of this latter would

require   5.8 101
summarizing, we have shown that the characteristic be-
haviour at innity and near the horizon of hti in the
unruh state for a schwarzschild black hole on which our
understanding of black hole evaporation so far is based
can be reproduced by the anomaly induced eective ac-
tion once appropriate boundary conditions are imposed
on the auxiliary elds  and . however, one should
damp enthusiasm: sef f
an as it stands is not able to cor-
rectly reproduce subleading terms in hti. for example
one expects [10] that leading terms in ht 
 i as r  
to start o as r4 whereas our analysis predicts the exis-
tence of a r3 term. this failure is not surprising given
the incompleteness of sef f
in particular, it is known
an .
that the reigert action [8] does not give the correct cor-
relation functions of the theory [12]. it would be inter-
esting to consider some more complicated versions of the
nonlocal eective action, which are based on the green
functions of the second order conformal operators rather
than on the fourth order 4 .
we end our work by mentioning that a similar construc-
tion can be given also for the hartle-hawking state (black
hole in thermal equilibrium) and for the boulware state.
we will report on this elsewhere [9].
