abstract

we generalize the background gauge in the matrix model to propose a new
gauge which is useful for discussing the conformal symmetry. in this gauge, the
special conformal transformation (sct) as the isometry of the near-horizon geom-
etry of the d-particle solution is directly reproduced with the correct coecient as
the quantum correction to the sct in the matrix model. we also present a general
argument for the relation between the gauge choice and the eld redenition in
the matrix model.

1 introduction

it has been established that at low energies d-branes are described eectively by the born-
infeld action, whose lowest order with respect to the number of derivatives is the super-yang-
mills theory (sym) [1]. when m-theory is compactied in the innite momentum frame, only
the degrees of freedom of d-particles remain. it was therefore conjectured that the system
is fundamentally described by d = 1 sym, i.e., the matrix model [2, 3]. the conjecture
of the matrix model has been intensively investigated in many systems and compared to
supergravity. especially, d-particle scatterings with multi-bodies have been checked up to
two loops [4, 5, 6], though disagreement for higher loops in a more complicated system is
suspected [7]. therefore, we have to show the full agreement between the matrix model and
supergravity to conrm the validity of the matrix model as a non-perturbative denition of
m-theory. a possible way to show the full agreement is to rely on symmetries. for example,
the supersymmetries put restrictions on the form of the matrix model eective action in the
rst few orders of the derivative expansion [8, 9, 10].

conformal symmetry imposes another restriction on the eective action of the sym, and
in particular, the matrix model. in fact, it is shown in [11] that the born-infeld action with
the background of the near-horizon geometry of the d3-brane solution (that is, the anti-de-
sitter or ads space) can be determined exactly by the isometry of the ads space. the special
conformal transformation (sct) of the isometry of the ads space diers from the canonical
one in sym by an extra term which vanishes on the boundary. however, interestingly, this
extra term can be derived from sym as a quantum correction [12]. in this way, the problem
of showing the full agreement between the born-infeld action with the ads background and
the eective action of sym is reduced to showing that the quantum modied symmetry of
sym reproduces exactly the isometry of the ads space.

although the maximally sym in d 6= 4 is not a conformal eld theory and the near-horizon
geometry of the dp-brane with p 6= 3 is not of the ads type, one can generalize the above
arguments to dp-branes by varying also the coupling constant under the dilatation and the
sct in both the sym and the dp-brane geometry [13]. this time, though the isometry of
the near-horizon geometry determines the born-infeld action, the sct derived from the sym
appears to dier from that of the isometry by a numerical factor. the sct ward-takahashi
identity still holds only when one keeps the terms proportional to the derivative of the coupling
constant in the eective action, because they are also relevant after the transformation [14, 15].
it is also shown that the two scts (i.e., the isometry and the quantum modied one in sym)
are related by a eld redenition. though consistent, the notorious numerical factor prevents
us from determining the born-infeld action directly. hence, it would be dicult to show the
full agreement between the matrix model and the born-infeld theory from the symmetry.

besides, it is unclear why the eld redenition is necessary in spite of the fact that in other
works [4, 5, 6] studying the relationship between the matrix model and the supergravity they
always agree without any eld redenitions.

in this paper, we present a new gauge in sym, which is a natural extension of the back-
ground gauge adopted in all the previous works [13, 14, 15]. this new gauge has a marvelous
property that the sct as the isometry of the near-horizon geometry of the dp-brane solu-
tion is correctly reproduced without eld redenitions as the quantum modied sct of sym,
unlike in the case of the conventional background gauge.

then, the result in our new gauge raises a question: what is the meaning of the gauge
choice in the matrix model? therefore, we give a general argument to identify the change of
gauge-xing in the matrix model as the redenition of the d-brane coordinates. as a concrete
example of this argument, we carry out the calculation in the r gauge. we nd among other
things that the agreement between the matrix model and the supergravity without any eld
redenitions [4, 5, 6] is merely a special nature of the background gauge.

the organization of the rest of this paper is as follows. in section 2, we summarize the
quantum conformal symmetry in sym. we derive the quantum modied sct and explain
the disagreement of the numerical factor with that in the isometry. in section 3, we present
our new gauge and analyze the quantum sct in this gauge. in section 4, we give a general
argument on the relation of changing the gauge in sym to the eld redenition in the eective
action, and in section 5 we analyze the r gauge as an example of the general formalism given
in section 4. in the nal section, we summarize the paper and discuss further directions. in
the appendices, we present some technical details used in the text.

2 quantum conformal symmetry in sym

first, let us summarize the quantum conformal symmetry in sym [13, 12, 14, 15] in detail,
because the methods needed afterwards are essentially the same. it is well known that the
action of d = 4 n = 4 sym has conformal symmetry. this is also the case for the sym with
sixteen supersymmetries in other dimensions if we assign the coupling constant a conformal
dimension and vary it under the transformation. we will here consider sym in the euclidean
formulation:

ssym =z dp+1x

(1)

the action (1) is invariant under both the dilatation and sct. in particular, the transforma-
tion law of the bosonic variables under sct reads

c
sctx = 2xx  x2,

c
scta = 2xa  2(xa  ax),

where the superscript c in c

sct is for distinguishing the present classical transformation from

in order to quantize the system, we have to add the gauge-xing and the corresponding

ghost terms to the original action (1):

sgf+gh =z dp+1x ibrst tr( cg).

in the original work of [14], they adopted the famous background gauge

g = a + i[bm, ym] +

1

g2
ymb,

(3)

(4)

where ym is the uctuation of the scalars xm from the diagonal background bm; xm =
bm + ym, and b is the auxiliary eld for the o-shell closure of the brst algebra. the brst
transformation of the elds are

brsta = dc  c  i[a, c],
brstc = ic 2,

brst c = ib,

brstb = 0.

brstxm = i[xm, c],

(5)

we assign the sct of the unphysical elds so that c
are commutative, [c

sct, brst] = 0:

sct and the brst transformation brst

c
sctc = 0,

c

c = 2(p  1)x c,

c
sctb = 2(p  1)x b.

(6)

while sgf+gh (3) with g of (4) is dilatation invariant, it is not invariant under sct (2):

sctsgf+gh = ibrst[a, c],
c

(7)

(8)

where [a, c] is given by

 =

p  1
2

(4)z dp+1x tr(cid:16) c(x)a(x)(cid:17) .

in general, if a symmetry of the classical action is violated by the gauge-xing and the ghost
terms sgf+gh and the violation is given as the brst-exact form ibrst, the symmetry can be
restored by adding to the original transformation for a generic eld  the brst transformation
ibrst with this (eld dependent) transformation parameter .
in fact, the change of
the path-integral measure under the added brst transformation just cancels the violation
ibrst. therefore, in the present case, the eective action [b, g2
ym] of the system satises
the following sct ward-takahashi identity,

z dp+1x c

sctbm,i for bm = diag (bm,i) is

q

sctbm,i(x) = 2(p  1)d[c(x), xm(x)]iiz dp+1y tr( c(y)a(y))e.

(10)

note that the total sct for bm is now given as a sum of the classical part c
2  xbm,i and the quantum correction q

sctbm,i.

now let us explicitly calculate q

sctbm,i (10). at the 1-loop order it is given by

sctbm,i =

q

sctbm,i(x) = 2(p  1)z dp+1y(cid:16)hcij(x) cji(y)ihym,ji(x)a,ij(y)i  (i  j)(cid:17) ,

where the free propagators are

hcij(x) cji(y)i = ihx| ij |yi ,

hym,ji(x)a,ij(y)i = 2ig2

keeping only the lowest order terms in the derivatives, eq. (11) is reduced to

restricting ourselves to the source-probe conguration with n dp-branes as the source at the
origin and the probe at bm; bm = diag(0,   , 0, bm), we obtain the nal form of the quantum

sctum of sct has an extra numerical factor (p1)/2 compared to the
isometry of the near-horizon geometry of the dp-brane solution [14]. since it is the isometry
of the near-horizon geometry that determines the born-infeld action with the background,
one may wonder if the sct derived in sym is consistent with the ward-takahashi identity.
however, it was pointed out in [14] that, since the derivative of the coupling constant  
g2

ym transforms under sct as

ym/g2

(15)

sct = 2(p  3) + o(),

4

(16)

we have to keep terms linear in  in the calculation of the 1-loop eective action to conrm
the validity of the ward-takahashi identity.1 let us check it for the d-particle case. for this
purpose, we need the quadratic parts of the action:

(17)

with vm,ij  bm,ij  1
situation from (17) as

2bm,ij. we can read o the 1-loop eective action for the source-probe

1-loop = n trn10 ln(cid:16)2 +  + b2(cid:17) + ln(cid:16)1  4vmvm(cid:17)
ln(cid:16)2 + b2  b(cid:17)o,

2 ln(cid:16)2 + b2(cid:17)  4x

(18)

where tr denotes the trace over the functional space of  , and  is dened by   (2 +
 + b2)1 =    + o(2) with   (2 + b2)1. in (18), the rst term is the
contribution of ly y and laa, the second term is due to the mixing between ym and a, the
third term is the ghost loop and the last term is from l. keeping only terms independent
of and linear in , we have

1-loop = n trn8 ln(cid:16)2 + b2(cid:17) + ln(cid:16)1  4 bm bm(cid:17)  4x

ln(cid:16)2 + b2  b(cid:17)

+10 + 4(cid:16)bm bm + 2 bm bm(cid:17)(cid:16)1  4 b b(cid:17)1o.

(19)

note that the sct of the terms of the formr d ( ) (total derivative terms) in the eec-
tive action vanish if we put  = 0 after the transformation. then, since we have h| o |i =
(1/2)h| o |i for o =  and  bm bm(1  4 b b)1 due to h1| |2i = h2| |1i,
the terms proportional to  and relevant for sct are
trn4(cid:16)bm bm(cid:17)(cid:16)1  4 b b(cid:17)1o = trn4bm bm + 16bm bm b bo, (20)

where we have kept only the terms with the number of derivatives less than or equal to four.
note that we cannot adopt the eikonal approximation and drop the acceleration terms here
[15], because by integration by parts, they can be converted to terms without the accelerations.
a method to evaluate it was given in our previous work [15]: we took polynomial forms for
the background bm( ), calculated the 1-loop eective action, and identied the result as a

1 we consider the lowest non-trivial order in  and hence put  = 0 after the sct.

functional of bm( ). an equivalent, but more rened method was presented in [10]: all the
terms are rearranged into the forms of f ( )mn, which are calculated using the proper-
time representation. here we adopt the more convenient method of [10]. using the formulas
presented in the appendix, the terms linear in  in 1-loop are calculated to give

the problem of the extra factor (p  1)/2 in q
sctum (14) is now resolved by taking into
account the sct of the term (15/8) b2 bb/b7 in (22). moreover, this -dependent term in
(22) can be eliminated by making the eld redenition bm  ebm with
in tree = r d b2
without the extra factor (p  1)/2.

3 a new gauge

instead of the usual background gauge (4), here we propose a bit dierent gauge function
useful for discussing the conformal symmetry in the sym. in fact, we shall nd that the
notorious numerical factor (p  1)/2 does not appear this time. the gauge function of our
new gauge is

g = a + a + i[bm, ym] +

1
2

g2
ymb,

(24)

which has the additional term a compared to the old one (4). as in the previous case, the
sct symmetry broken by sgf+gh can be restored by adding to the classical sct the brst
transformation with a eld dependent parameter . in our new gauge, [ c, a] is

 = 4z dp+1x tr(cid:16) c(x)a(x)(cid:17).

(25)

note that in the usual background gauge (4) the factor (p 1)/2 in q
sctum (14) originates in
(8). however, it is missing in (25). this implies that we can derive the sct of the isometry
with the correct factor in our new gauge, namely, q

sctum in the new gauge is given by
krp
u 2  um,

(26)

sctum = 2x um 

6

instead of that in (14).

since now the isometry that determines the born-infeld action has been reproduced with
the correct coecient, we can expect that the -dependent terms such as (15/8) b2 bb/b7 in
(22) are missing from the one-loop eective action for the d-particle. let us explicitly check
it in the rest of this section. the quadratic parts of the d-particle action in the new gauge
are

(27)

and l is the same as (17) in the old gauge. the one-loop eective action for the source-probe
conguration is given by

1-loop = n trn9 ln(cid:16)2 +  + b2(cid:17) + ln(cid:16)2   + b2(cid:17)
ln(cid:16)2 + b2  b(cid:17)o,

+ ln(cid:16)1  4 bm(2 +  + b2)1 bm(2   + b2)1(cid:17)
2 ln(cid:16)2 +  + b2(cid:17)  4x

(28)

where the origin of the respective terms are the same as before (18). the -independent term
in 1-loop is the same as in (22), while the term linear in  is seen to be expressed as

trnoo =z d ( )

1
2

h| o |i ,

(29)

in terms of a symmetric o satisfying h1|o |2i = h2|o |1i. eq. (29) is sct invariant by
putting  = 0 after the transformation.

let us summerize our ndings in this section. in the usually adopted background gauge
(4), the quantum sct has an extra numerical factor (p 1)/2. however, if we adopt the new
gauge (24), this extra factor disappears and we can derive directly the conformal symmetry
that determines the full born-infeld action. accordingly, the -dependent terms in 1-loop is
also missing up to total derivative terms in our new gauge.

the calculation in this section shows that the form of quantum sct depends crucially on
the choice of gauge. therefore one may question what the role of the gauge function is. we
can nd a clue in [14], where it is shown that the sct with the extra factor (p  1)/2 can be
related to the sct without it by the eld redenition (23). therefore it seems that the role
of the gauge function is to choose the denition of the elds in the born-infeld action side.
in the following sections, we shall study the relationship between the gauge choice and the
redenition of the elds.

7

4 gauge shifts and eld redenitions

here we give some general arguments on the relations between the change of the gauge function
and the eld redenition. the following is essentially the reproduction of the old arguments
about the independence of the physical s-matrices in the yang-mills theory on the choice of
gauge [16].

let us consider the partition function,

zg[j] =z d es+j ,

(30)

where  denotes collectively all the elds in the system and j is the corresponding source.
the action s consists of the gauge-xing and the ghost terms as well as the gauge invariant
one; s = ssym + ibrst( cg). the dots in j and cg denote both the integration over the
coordinates and the trace over the group indices.

under an innitesimal change of the gauge function, g  g + g, we have

zg+g[j]  zg[j] = z d brst(i cg)es+j 

= z d (i cg)(jbrst)es+j ,

(31)

where in the last equality we have used the brst ward-takahashi identity. therefore, the
partition function with the gauge function g + g is expressed as

zg+g[j] = z d(cid:16)1 + (i cg)(jbrst)(cid:17)es+j 
= z d expns + j(cid:16) + ibrst ( cg)(cid:17)o .

(32)

this is nothing but the partition function for the eld  + ibrst ( c g) in the original
gauge g.

our next task is to restate the property (32) in terms of the eective action g[] which is
related to ln zg[j] by the legendre transformation. in appendix b, we show that (32) implies
the following relation between g+g and g:

g+g[] = g[ + hibrst ( cg)i],

(33)

where hoi denotes the generating functional of the 1pi greens function with an insertion of
the operator o in the original gauge.

let us apply the general arguments given above to the relation between our new gauge
(24) and the old one (4) and reproduce the eld redenition (23) in the d-particle case. using

8

(33) with  = bm and g = a, and (12), we nd that

ebm( ) = bm( ) +d[xm, c]n +1,n +1( )z d0 tr ca(0)e

= bm z d0 (0)(cid:16)dcn +1,i( ) ci,n +1(0)edym,i,n +1( )an +1,i(0)e  (i  n + 1)(cid:17)
= bm  4g2

ymn h|  bm|i = bm  g2

b5 ,

ymn

(34)

where we have kept only those terms with the number of derivatives less than or equal to two.
note that g = a can be regarded as innitesimal since we are interested only in the lowest
non-trivial order in . the result (34) agrees exactly with (23) proposed by [14].

5 matrix model in the r gauge

in this section, we shall consider the matrix model in another gauge. this will give a sup-
port for the validity of the general arguments of the previous section through a non-trivial
calculation. it will also give a lesson about the structures of the eld redenitions and the
non-renormalization theorem. the gauge we take here is the r gauge with |1  |  1:

g = a + i [bm, ym] +

1
2

g2

ymb,

(35)

which has the properties that for  = 1 it reduces to the original background gauge, and that
the y -a mixing is given by ly a of (17) independently of the value of . for an innitesimal
  1  , the dierence from the original background gauge is

g = (cid:16)i[bm, ym]

2

g2

ymb(cid:17) =



2(cid:16)a + i[bm, ym](cid:17).

(36)

from the general formula (33) of the previous section, we can obtain the eld redenition
relating the r gauge and the original background gauge ( = 1). the calculation is carried
out by using the free propagators for  = 1,
hcij(1) cji(2)i = ih1| ij |2i ,

to conrm the eld redenition (37), let us next consider the 1-loop eective action in the

r gauge:

1-loop = n tr(cid:26)ln(cid:16)(2 +  + b2)mn  (1  )bmbn(cid:17) + ln(cid:16)2 +  + b2(cid:17)

2 ln(cid:16)2 + b2(cid:17)  4x

ln(cid:16)2 + b2  b(cid:17)(cid:27),

(38)

where tr for the rst term implies also the trace operation with respect to (m, n). keeping only
those terms proportional to  and at most linear in , and further with number of derivatives
less than or equal to four, we get after tedious but straightforward calculations the following
result for the shift of the eective action in the r gauge from that in the  = 1 gauge:

in obtaining (39), we used the cyclicity of the trace to put all the terms coming from the ex-
pansion of (38) into the standard forms of bm   f ( ) or    f ( ), and applied
the formulas in appendix a.
then, our next task is to determine the redenition bm  ebm in such a way that the
of the new eld ebm. the condition for the identication is apparently overdetermined. for
example, the four-derivative terms independent of  in (39) must correspond to the shift of
bm by some two-derivative terms. there are 5 kinds of such terms in the shift of bm; bm/b5,
bm b b/b7,   , bm( b b)2/b9. on the other hand, there are 11 kinds of four-derivative
...
b b/b5,   , ( bb)4/b11.
terms independent of  in the 1-loop eective action;
besides, there are 5 kinds of total derivative terms as the ambiguity of the eective action;
...
bb/b5], d/d [ b b/b5],   , d/d [( bb)3/b9]. therefore, we have 11 equations with
d/d [
only 5+5 unknowns. however, there is a solution and it coincides with (37) obtained from the
general formula (33).

we can also calculate the quantum sct in the r gauge to check the consistency of the
eld redenition (37). note the expression for the quantum sct in the r gauge is not
changed form (10), and we obtain

one can easily see that the two quantum scts, (40) and (13) with p = 0, are consistently
related by the redenition (37).

finally in this section we shall give some comments. first, although it might seem strange
that there appear two-derivative terms (the rst two terms) in (39), it does not contradict the
non-renormalization theorem of [8]. the statement of [8] is that if we remove the ( bb)2/b5
term by a suitable coordinate transformations, the other term b2/b3 will automatically dis-
appear. actually, the bm/b3 term in (37) removes the two terms in (39) simultaneously.

our second comment is on the meaning of the eld redenitions. the redenition (23)
is simply a eld dependent shift of the world-volume coordinate  and hence is interpretable
as a change of reparametrization gauge in the born-infeld action. however, the redenition
(37) contains, besides the terms interpretable as the target space coordinate transformation
(the bm/b3 term) and the world-volume reparametrization (terms containing bm), all kinds
of terms with a given dimension.

6 conclusions and further directions

in this paper, we proposed a new gauge which is useful for discussing the conformal symmetry
in the matrix model. the form of the quantum modied sct depends crucially on the choice
of gauge in sym, and our new gauge reproduced exactly the sct of the isometry. we also
gave a general argument on the relation between the change of gauge and the eld redenition
in the eective action. then, we examined the r gauge as an example and reconrmed the
special nature of the background gauge and our new gauge. namely, the diagonal elements of
the higgs elds in sym correspond directly to the target space coordinates in the born-infeld
action in the static gauge only when we take the background gauge or our new gauge in sym.

we shall discuss some further directions of our work. first, the higher loop analysis of the
matrix model in our new gauge is an interesting subject. as the isometry of the near-horizon
geometry of the d-brane solution determines the born-infeld action and we can derive the
isometry directly from the 1-loop calculation in sym in our new gauge, we expect that the
quantum modied sct in sym is essentially 1-loop exact. the analysis of the quantum
modied sct in higher loops rather than that of the eective action would be a cleverer
way to show the full agreement between the matrix model and supergravity. our new gauge
would also be useful for analyzing more general multi-d-particle systems than the simple
source-probe conguration of this paper.

the new gauge we proposed in this paper may be important even conceptually. the fact
that the signs of the  in the kinetic terms (27) are opposite between ym (the coordinates
perpendicular to the branes) and a (the coordinates parallel to the branes) reminds us of the

11

spacetime uncertainty principle proposed by [17]. this would be a clue for the understanding
of the deep meaning of our new gauge.

b derivation of eq. (33)

in this appendix we present the derivation of eq. (33) for the eective action from eq. (32) for
the partition function zg[j]. for this purpose, let us introduce the generating functional of

13

the connected greens function w [j, k] in the gauge g with sources for   ibrst ( cg)
as well as for :

then, wg+g[ej]  ln zg+g[ej] is expressed in terms of w [j, k] as

ew [j,k] =z d es+j +k .

wg+g[ej] = w [ej, ej].

hence, g+g[], which is the legendre transformation of wg+g[ej], is expressed using (55)
and the taylor expansion w [j, k] = w [j, 0] + k  (w [j, k]/k)k=0, as

(54)

(55)

g+g[] = ej  w [ej, ej ] = ej  w [ej, 0]  ej

where the relation between  and ej is given by
ej

 =



w [ej, ej ].


k

w [ej, k](cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)k=0

,

(56)

(57)

on the other hand, let us dene [, k] which is the legendre transformation of w [j, k]

with respect only to j:

where  and j are related by

[, k] = j  w [j, k],

(58)

(59)
the precise meaning of hibrst ( c  g)i = hi in (33) is in fact ([, k]/k)k=0.
therefore, the right hand side of (33) is taylor expanded as

w [j, k].

 


j

g[ + hi] = g[] +




[, 0]


k

where we have used g[] = [, 0].

[, k](cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)k=0

.

(60)

for a given , let j be dened by (59) with k = 0, and hence j = [, 0]/. in view of

the denition (57) for ej, the dierence between ej and j is innitesimal of order g. plugging
ej = j + j into (56) and taylor expanding with respect to innitesimal j, we get
w [j, 0](cid:19).

g+g[] = j  w [j, 0]  j

+ j(cid:18) 


k


j

(61)

this agrees with (60) since we have w [j, k]/k = [, k]/k obtained from the deriva-
tive of (58). note that the explicit expression of j is unnecessary here.

w [j, k](cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)k=0
