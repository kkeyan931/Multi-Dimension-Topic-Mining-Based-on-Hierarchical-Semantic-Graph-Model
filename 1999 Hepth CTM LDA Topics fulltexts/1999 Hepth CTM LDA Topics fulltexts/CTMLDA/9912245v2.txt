abstract

this brief report presents analytical solutions to the equations of motion of a
null string. the background spacetime is a magnetically charged kaluza-klein
black hole. the string coordinates are expanded with the world-sheet velocity
of light as an expansion parameter. it is shown that the zeroth order solutions
can be expressed in terms of elementary functions in an appropriate large
distance approximation. in addition, a class of exact solutions corresponding
to the pollard-gross-perry-sorkin monopole case is also obtained.

string propagation in curved spacetime has been a subject of study in a large number of
papers (for a review, see [1]). to study string interaction with the background spacetime,
the string equations of motion are obtained from the world-sheet action and are solved by
simplifying them with suitable ansatze. it has been suggested by de vega and nicolaidis [2]
that the world-sheet velocity of light c, the velocity of wave propagation along the string, can
be an expansion parameter for the string coordinates. the limit of small c corresponds to
the strong gravity limit [24], the length of the string being much larger than the curvature
radius.

the formalism developed in the literature [14] is applicable to both cosmic strings
and fundamental strings. however, in the latter case the theory is formulated in higher
dimensions. thus we expect a nontrivial contribution to the string dynamics from the extra
compact dimensions. in other words, it is of interest to study in what way the propagation
of a string probe is aected by these extra dimensions. an attempt in this direction was
made in [5]. the propagation of a null string in a kaluza-klein black hole background was
studied. it was shown that, even at the classical level, the unfolding of an extra dimension
can be seen by the string probe. the kaluza-klein radius, i.e., the radius around which
the extra dimension winds, decreases for a magnetically charged black hole, as viewed by a
null string approaching it. for an electrically charged background, the kaluza-klein radius
behaves in the opposite sense.

in this brief report we extend the work done already in ref. [5] and obtain analytical
counterparts of the solutions presented there for the magnetically charged black hole case, for
small values of the scalar charge. in addition, we show that the problem is solvable exactly for
the case of the pollard-gross-perry-sorkin (pgps) monopole, which has been shown recently
to arise as a solution of a suitable dimensionally reduced string theory [6]. this report is
more or less technical in content. we believe our results may be of some signicance since
analytical solutions are presented for physically interesting higher dimensional backgrounds.

we start with the string world-sheet action [7] given by

s = t0z d dqdetgab

(1)

where gab = g(x)ax bx  is the two-dimensional world-sheet metric;  and  are the
world sheet coordinates and t0 is the string tension.

the classical equations of motion in the conformal gauge [2] are given by

where dot and prime denote dierentiation w.r.t.  and  respectively. these equations
describe the motion of a null string [2]. the second equation constrains the motion to be
perpendicular to the string.

we study string propagation in a background given by the metric [8]

where k2 = 4g; x5 is the extra dimension and winds around a circle,  and a represent
the scalar eld and the gauge eld respectively. here g is the four-dimensional metric.

here we restrict ourselves to the exterior region r > m and the equatorial plane, i.e.  = /2.
these equations can be reduced to quadratures involving constants of integration which

and can be solved to obtain t, r,  and x5 as functions of  [5]. in (12) we have taken the
case of a string falling in head-on.

the integrals (12) have been evaluated numerically [5] and inverted to obtain the coor-
dinates as functions of  in the limit r >> . however, the quadratures can be reduced
to combinations of elliptical integrals, depending on the relative values of constants 1 and
m (see [10]). rather than tabulate these, we concentrate on the region r >> , where the
solutions reduce to elementary functions. we take for instance the case c1 = c3 = 1. up to
the rst order in 1/r, the solutions (modulo integration constants which depend on ) are

horizon but not asymptotically far from the black hole. the negative sign comes because
we consider an in-falling string. the solutions match with the numerical solutions reported
in [5] for the corresponding values of c1 and c3 (see figure 1).

equations (11) can be solved exactly, i.e., without resorting to the limit r >> , for
the special case p = 2m and q = 0 (the pollard-gross-perry-sorkin monopole [11]). the
constraint equation (8) implies that 1 = m or 1 = 2m. in the former case, the metric
reduces to the form reported in ref. [11]. here the time coordinate t is the same as the
proper time  of the string. the solutions are

where  = 1+3c2
. we choose c1 = 1; the condition of reality of the solutions then forces

c3 < 1 and consequently  > 1. figure 2 shows a plot of r versus  for c3 = 0.6. a
comparison of gures 1 and 2 shows that the approach to the horizon is dierent in the
two cases.
in the pgps case, the string decelerates as it approaches the horizon. this
is not surprising as the repulsive or anti-gravity eect of extremal black holes has been
commented on in the literature (see for example, [12] and [13]).

in addition to the above cases, there is another solution (which has not been mentioned
hitherto in the literature) corresponding to 1 = 2m. the integrals can be solved in terms
of elliptical functions, the solutions being

we have found out analytical solutions to the equations of motion to zeroth order in
the expansion in powers of c. the solutions obtained in the case when r is large compared
to the scalar charge match with those obtained numerically in [5], for corresponding values
of the integration constants c1 and c3. although the results presented for the large r case
are technically the same as the ones obtained in [5], the analytical solutions reveal two new
cases where the problem is solved exactly. these include the well known pgps extremal
black hole.

the equations of motion for the electrically charged black hole case do not reduce to
quadratures (see [5]). however, the analytical results obtained in the magnetically charged
case give hope that some qualitative predictions can be made in that case as well. the
optimism comes from the fact that the electrically charged black hole solutions are related
to the magnetically charged ones by the duality transformation p  q, q  p and   
[8,9]. these analytical zeroth order results also form the basis for higher order calculations,
work on which is in progress.
