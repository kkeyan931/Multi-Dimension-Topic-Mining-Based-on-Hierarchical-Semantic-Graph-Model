the world-volume theory on a d-brane in a constant b-eld background can be

described by either commutative or noncommutative yang-mills theories. these two de-

scriptions correspond to two dierent gauge xing of the dieomorphism on the brane.

comparing the boundary states in the two gauges, we derive a map between commutative

and noncommutative gauge elds in a path integral form, when the gauge group is u (1).

1. introduction

noncommutativity of coordinates appears in the study of d-branes in two apparently

dierent situations. one such situation occurs when n d-branes coincide. then their

transverse coordinates are promoted to n  n matrices. another situation is the one in
which the boundary coordinates x i( ) of an open string become noncommutative in the
presence of a constant ns-ns b-eld [1,2,3,4]. the commutation relations of x i( )s are

written as

[x i( ), x j( )] = iij.

(1.1)

these relations lead to the noncommutativity of the world-volume coordinates of d-branes,

which was rst appeared in the compactication of matrix theory in a three-form eld

background [59].

as was pointed out in [10], in a sense these two noncommutativity are dual to each

other. a d-brane in a constant b-eld background can be described as a collection of in-

nitely many lower dimensional d-branes [10,11,12,13]. in this description, the transverse

coordinates of lower dimensional d-branes should satisfy the same relation as (1.1).

in [14], seiberg and witten argued that the theory on d-branes in a b-eld back-

ground can be described by either commutative or noncommutative yang-mills theories

and these descriptions correspond to pauli-villars and point splitting regularizations of

the world-sheet theory, respectively. they derived the relation between the commutative

gauge eld a and the noncommutative gauge eld ba by requiring the equivalence of the
gauge transformation of a and ba.

in the d-brane world-volume perspective, these two descriptions correspond to two

dierent gauge xing of the world-volume dieomorphism [15,16]. one is the static gauge

and the other is the constant eld strength gauge (in the following, we will call the

latter gauge f =  gauge). in the static gauge, the coordinates parallel to the brane

are xed and the ordinary gauge eld remains as a dynamical eld.

in f =  gauge,

the uctuation of ordinary gauge eld is set to zero. in this gauge, the dynamical degree

of freedom are carried by the scalar elds corresponding to the parallel coordinates of

the brane. the noncommutative gauge eld appears as the uctuation of this scalar eld

around the static gauge conguration. the two dierent descriptions are mapped to each

other by the world-volume dieomorphism.

in [15,16], the relation between a and ba is derived from the dieomorphism invariance

of d-branes, but only in a semiclassical sense, i.e. the moyal bracket is replaced with the

1

poisson bracket. in this paper, we will derive the map a 7 ba by comparing the boundary

states in the two dierent gauges, when the gauge group is u (1). the main claim of this

paper is that the map is given by

z d() exp(cid:18)iz d
=z d() exp(cid:18)iz d

2

ijij + ai(y + )(yi + i)(cid:19)
ijij + bai(y + )yi(cid:19)

(1.2)

where ij = (1)ij and yi() is an arbitrary function. we will show that this relation

satises the requirement for the mapping between a and ba, namely the equivalence of the
gauge transformations for a and ba.

this paper is organized as follows: in section 2, we review the symmetries of boundary

states and the derivation of the map in the semiclassical form. in section 3, we derive the

relation (1.2) by comparing the boundary states in the two dierent gauges and show that

it gives the correct relation between a and ba. section 4 is devoted to discussions.

2. symmetries of d-brane boundary states

in this section, we consider boundary states in a constant background b-eld and

their symmetries.

in the following, we will gauge away the b-eld in the bulk of the

world-sheet and treat it as a gauge eld background with constant eld strength. to

construct boundary states, it is convenient to introduce the coherent state |xi dened by
x i()|xi = xi()|xi. |xi can be written as

|xi = exp(cid:18)iz dpi()xi()(cid:19) |di

(2.1)

where |di is the dirichlet boundary state dened by x i()|di = 0 and pi is the momentum
conjugate to x i. when we consider a dp-brane, i runs from 0 to p. using |xi, the boundary

state coupled to a u (1) gauge eld a is given by [17]

|bi =z dxeir a(x)|xi.

in the case of the constant eld strength fij = ij, (2.2) is reduced to

|bi =z dx exp(cid:18)iz d

1
2

ijxixj  pixi(cid:19) |di.

2

(2.2)

(2.3)

in the following, we assume that p is odd and ij is invertible.

now we consider the uctuation of the dp-brane around the above conguration. the

most general form of the boundary state is

|a, i =z d(x) exp(cid:18)iz d(cid:0)ai(x)xi  pii(x)(cid:1)(cid:19) |di,

(2.4)

where ai is the gauge eld on the dp-brane and i is the scalar eld corresponding to the
coordinate parallel to the dp-brane. we suppress the transverse coordinates of the brane

for simplicity. the uctuation around the conguration (2.3) is parametrized as

ai =

1
2

jixj + ai, i = xi + ijaj.

(2.5)

following [15,16], we review the argument that ai and ai become the ordinary and

noncommutative gauge elds, respectively, after the gauge xing of the dieomorphism on

the d-brane. so as to make |a, i dieomorphism invariant, we choose the measure d(x)

in (2.4) as

d(x) =y

dx() det(cid:18) i

xj(cid:19)(cid:0)x()(cid:1).

(2.6)

under the dieomorphism on the dp-brane, a and i transform as a 1-form and a scalar,

respectively, i.e.

dia = lva = (div + ivd)a,

di i = lvi = vkki.

|a, i is also invariant under the gauge transformation

gaugea = d, gauge = 0,

and the canonical transformation

cana = 0, can = lham,

where ham is a hamiltonian vector eld dened by

(2.7)

(2.8)

(2.9)

ihamf = d.

(2.10)

we can see that the canonical transformation is equivalent to the eld dependent gauge

transformation up to the dieomorphism:

can() = gauge( + ihama) + di (ham).

(2.11)

3

by xing the dieomorphism invariance, we can obtain two dierent pictures for the

same state. the rst is the static gauge which is dened by i = xi. in this gauge,

|a, i is reduced to

|ai =z dxeir apixi

|di.

(2.12)

the second is the f =  gauge. in this gauge, the uctuation of a is set to be zero,

and |a, i becomes

|i =z d(x)eir 1

2 ij xidxj pii

|di.

(2.13)

for |ai, the residual dieomorphism invariance is the canonical transformation with re-

spect to the symplectic form f which coincides with the usual gauge symmetry for a, or

for a. on the other hand, |i has no gauge eld but it has a residual dieomorphism

symmetry which preserves the symplectic form . its action on  is given by

 = {, } = klkl.

in terms of ai, this symmetry is written as ijaj = {i, }, or

ai = i + klkail.

(2.14)

(2.15)

since the two states |ai and |i correspond to two dierent gauge choice for the same

state, they should be equivalent under the dieomorphism. under the change of variable

x = (y)

(2.16)

in the path integral (2.12), the equivalence of the two states (2.12) and (2.13) requires

a =

1
2

ij yidyj + d().

(2.17)

this relation gives a nontrivial mapping between ai and ai [15,16].

although one can show that ai is equal to the noncommutative gauge eld ba up to the
second order in -expansion, ai is obviously not equal to ba since the gauge transformation

for ai (2.15) is given in terms of the poisson bracket instead of the moyal bracket.

4

3. the map between commutative and noncommutative gauge fields

in this section, we propose the resolution of the discrepancy between ai and bai and
give a simple rule for the map between ai and bai. as we will see below, in order to realize
the noncommutative gauge symmetry for ba, we should change the integration measure in

|i from d(x) to the at measure dx. we write the state with the measure dx as

|inc =z dx exp(cid:18)iz d

1
2

ijxixj  pii(x)(cid:19) |di.

with this measure, the uctuation of i can be identied with ba:

i(x) = xi + ijbaj(x).

to show that |inc is invariant under the noncommutative gauge transformation for

ba, it is convenient to use the t-dual picture. in terms of the coherent state f|yi for the

t-dual coordinate, |di is written as

|di =z dyf|yi.

(3.1)

(3.2)

(3.3)

(3.4)

(3.5)

on f|yi, pi acts as yi. therefore, the original and the t-dual coherent state are related

[18] by

|xi =z dy exp(cid:18)iz dyixi(cid:19)f|yi.

using these relations, |inc can be written as

|inc =z dxdy exp(cid:18)iz d
=z dxdy exp(cid:18)iz d
=z ddy exp(cid:18)iz d

(3.6)

where the expectation value is dened by

(3.7)

using cw (ba), eq.(3.5) is written as

in the same way, |ai becomes

|inc =z dycw (ba) exp(cid:18)iz d

|ai =z dy w (a) exp(cid:18)iz d

ba is

w (a) =cw (ba).

in the rest of this section, we will show that eq.(3.11) gives the correct mapping between

what we have to show are:

the ordinary gauge eld a and the noncommutative gauge eld ba.
(1) w (a) andcw (ba) are invariant under the ordinary and noncommutative gauge trans-
(2) eq.(3.11) has a nontrivial solution ba(a).

if these two conditions are satised, the map obtained from (3.11) agrees with the one

formations, respectively.

dened in [14].

first let us consider the condition (1). the noncommutative gauge transformation for

where the star product is dened by

bai = i + i  bai  ibai  ,
n!(cid:18) i

the two-point function

(cid:10)i()j()(cid:11) =(cid:2)(i)1(cid:3)ij

=

i
2

ij(  ),

(3.14)

cw (ba) can be rewritten as
xn=1

cw (ba) = 1 +

in

n!z d1    dnt(cid:0)bai1      bain(cid:1)1 yi1    n yin ,

where t denotes the time ordering. for example,

tnf(cid:0)y(1)(cid:1)  g(cid:0)y(2)(cid:1)o = (1  2)f  g + (2  1)g  f.

(3.15)

(3.16)

note that (3.15) is the simplest example of the path integral representation of the star

product studied in [19,20]. in (3.15), we generalized the notion of the star product to the

product of functions at dierent points:

f (x)  g(y) =

1

n!(cid:18) i
2(cid:19)n

xn=0

k1l1    knln k1    kn f (x)l1    ln g(y).

(3.17)

from the expression (3.15), we can easily see that cw (ba) is invariant under the noncom-

mutative gauge transformation (3.12).

naively, the invariance of w (a) under ai = i is obvious from the denition of

w (a). but we should take care of the divergence coming from the contraction of i

and i with the same argument, since hi(1)2j(2)i is proportional to the delta

function (1  2). we subtract these divergent terms from w (a) to make it nite. this

prescription does not break the gauge invariance of w (a), since the divergent and nite

parts of w (a) are independently gauge invariant.

next we consider the condition (2). for eq.(3.11) to have a solution, w (a) has to

have the same form as cw (ba), namely the time ordered exponential. to explain that this

7

is true, we write the rst few terms of w (a):

(cid:28)iz dai(y + )(yi + i)(cid:29)
* 1
2!(cid:18)iz dai(y + )(yi + i)(cid:19)2+

3!(cid:18)iz dai(y + )(yi + i)(cid:19)3+

z d(  )(cid:10)f(cid:0)y() + ()(cid:1)g(cid:0)y() + ()(cid:1)(cid:11) = {f(cid:0)y()(cid:1)  g(cid:0)y()(cid:1)}s,

(3.23)

we can calculate the right hand side of (3.23) to any order in  by the simple rule of the

wick contraction. it might be possible to write down the explicit form of the map to all

order in  in the same way as [19,20], but we do not discuss it here.

4. discussions

in this paper, we derived the map between a and ba in a path integral form by com-

paring the boundary states in two dierent gauges of the world-volume dieomorphism. to

realize the noncommutative gauge symmetry, we chose the at measure dx in |inc. this
measure does not respect the canonical transformation symmetry of |i. this dierence

between |i and |inc may be related to the gauge equivalence of the star product [19].
this viewpoint deserves further study.

we comment on the generalization of our result to u (n ) gauge elds. one natural

way to generalize (1.2) is to replace the exponential with the trace of path ordered expo-

nential. but the relation obtained by this prescription is not enough to determine the map
completely, since the gauge eld has n 2 components. to construct the complete map, we

may have to use the additional symmetry of the boundary state, such as the non-abelian

generalization of dieomorphism considered in [15].
