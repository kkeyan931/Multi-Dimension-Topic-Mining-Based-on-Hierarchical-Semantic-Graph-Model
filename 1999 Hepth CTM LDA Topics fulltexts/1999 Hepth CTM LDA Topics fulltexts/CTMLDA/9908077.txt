(4) denotes schematically appropriate gauge transformation : a1 i1 gauge elds, 1 gauginoes, similarly scalars. consistency, gauge transformations must satisfy cocycle condition (l, l) = 1(l)(0, l) = 1(l)2(0)(0, 0) = 2(l)(l, 0) = 2(l)1(0)(0, 0). (5) therefore, 1(l)2(0) 2(l)1(0) must equal element center zn , 1(l)2(0) = exp ( 2in12 n )2(l)1(0).

(28) dominant contribution sensitive magnetic ux eq.(24) obtained minimum area surface 12 extremizes nambu-goto action. eq.(1) see surface arises string world sheet located horizon radial direction spans x1 x2 plane denite value x3. area minimal surface units fundamental string tension is, ah/(2) = 1 2 hl2 r2 r2 . (29) including eects anti-string (or equivalently string oppositely wound x1 x2 plane) gives: z(sugra+1string) = e(c2n 2t 3l3) 2cf eah /(2) cos( 2m3 n ). (30) coecient cf arises string path integral uctuations around minimal area surface. includes contribution, lt , due zero mode associated location surface x3 direction, contribution due non-zero modes well. also need include uctuation fermionic modes. particular, need worry fermionic zero modes might make contribution vanish consequence spacetime supersymmetry. expect however zero modes spacetime green schwarz fermions lifted thermal boundary condition breaks supersymmetry completely. using eq.(3), eq.(29), minimum area re-expressed as: eah /(2) = e3/2gsn 2l2 .

(32) subleading contributions eq.(32) arise string-worldsheets either wrap multiply wrap one two-cycle simultaneously. however, contributions exponentially suppressed compared included eq.(32) long qngs 2 l2 1, qn/gs 2 l2 1. (33) small gs rst condition restrictive. physically, eq.(33) means torus size much bigger electric magnetic string tensions. true contributions partition function multi-string sectors also suppressed. addition, subleading contributions (p, q) string worldsheets discuss shortly eq.(34). eq.(32) thus gives leading dependence partition function discrete uxes. main result section. comments order. first, worth noting minimum area surface gave dominant contribution eq.(32) simple interpretation gauge theory well. corresponds electric magnetic ux tube, small rst grows time span full 2-cycle. second, neglected terms gs expansions here. thus result pertains gauge theory large n strong hooft coupling. third, result apply zero temperature case. limit condition, eq.(33), longer met contributions multiply-wound multi-string states cannot neglected. finally, understand sl(2, z) transformation properties eq.(32) one needs include eects general (p, q) strings well. gives partition function: z( ) = xi,j xp,q cp,q( ) exp (atp,q( )) cos.
