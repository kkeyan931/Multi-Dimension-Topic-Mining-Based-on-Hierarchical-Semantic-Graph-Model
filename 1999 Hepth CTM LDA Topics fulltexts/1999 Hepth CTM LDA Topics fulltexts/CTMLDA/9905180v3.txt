abstract

the embedding of a taub-nut space in the directions transverse to the world
volume of branes describes branes at (spherical) orbifold singularities. similarly,
the embedding of a pp-wave in the brane world volume yields an ads orbifold. in
case of the d1-d5brane system, the ads3 orbifolds yields a btz black hole; as
we will show, the same holds for d3branes corresponding to ads5. in addition
we will show that the ads orbifolds and the spherical orbifolds are u-dual to each
other. however in contrast to spherical orbifolds the ads orbifolds lead to a running
coupling, which is in the ir inverse to the coupling of the spherical orbifold. a
discussion of the general pp-wave solution in ads space is added.

introduction

besides at spacetime, the near horizon geometry of regular branes, given by a direct
product of an anti de sitter (ads) space and a sphere, is maximal supersymmetric. by
projecting out a discrete subgroup of the isometry group the supersymmetry will be par-
tially broken. due to the direct product of spacetime, there are two distinct possibilities

the rst class of orbifolds, called spherical orbifolds, are well-known from string com-
pactication and have been discussed in the context of ads/cft correspondence [1, 2, 3]
in [4, 5, 6]. on the other hand a well-known example for an ads orbifold is the btz-
black hole which corresponds to ads3/zk [7], see also [8]. while spherical orbifolds
are related to an embedding of a taub-nut (tn) space in the transversal space, we
will show that ads orbifolds are obtained by (non-standard) pp-wave embeddings in
the brane world volume directions. since the anti-de sitter space is dened as a hyper-
boloid in a space with two time-like coordinates, one can embed up to two waves, i.e. one
can consider up to two independent orbifolds, which is also true for spherical orbifolds.
these double orbifolds correspond to an embedding of intersections of supergravity solu-
tions, e.g. ads5  s5/(zk  zk) is obtained in the decoupling limit from the intersection:
d3  t n  t n (see e.g. [9, 10]) and as we will argue ads5/(zk  zk)  s5 corresponds
to the intersection: d3  d(1)  wave. notice, from the f-theory perspective the
d(-1)-brane (d-instanton) is an internal wave in the two hidden dimensions [11].
obviously, from the supergravity point of view one can dualize the wave into a taub-
nut space and vice versa. so, both orbifolds should be equivalent. in fact we will show
that the ads orbifolds and the spherical orbifolds are u-dual to each other. but, we
have to keep in mind, that both orbifolds acts very dierently: the spherical orbifold
breaks the r-symmetry, whereas for the ads-orbifolds the lorentz symmetry is broken
(see discussion). the gauge theories, which correspond to the spherical orbifolds, have
reduced number of supersymmetries (compared to n = 4 in four dimensions), but are still
conformal eld theories with vanishing -function. on the other hand, the ads-orbifolds
yield a running coupling from the ultraviolett (uv) to the infrared (ir). this issue will
be discussed for ads3 in the next section and for ads5 in section 3. various aspects of
supergravity solutions with broken supersymmetries and possibly running couplings in
the corresponding gauge theories, but with unbroken lorentz symmetry, were recently
discussed in [12]-[24].

2 three-dimensional orbifolds

the 3-dimensional orbifolds are the simplest cases and the natural framework for their
discussion is the d1-d5brane system (or also of the f1-ns5), with the metric given by

ds2 =

1

h1h5(cid:16)  dt2 + dy2(cid:17) +qh1h5(cid:16)dr2 + r2d3(cid:17) + ds2

int .

(2)

for our purpose here, we can identify the two harmonics h1 = h5 = h = 1+q/r2 and get
a self-dual string in 6 dimensions. in the decoupling limit (equivalent to the near-horizon
limit with large charges) the internal 4-d metric ds2
int becomes a at euclidean space and
the remaining 6-d space becomes ads3  s3
l2(cid:16)  dt2 + dy2(cid:17) + l2 dr2

l2 = q1q5 = q  n

r2 # + l2 d3

ds2 = "r2

(3)

,

where l is the s3 radius which scales with the number of self-dual strings n.
we start with the discussion of the s3-orbifold (s3/zk) and in order to x our notation
and for later convenience let us repeat some known facts, see e.g. [25], [26]. an s3 with
a radius l is dened by

l2 = (x 0)2 + (x 1)2 + (x 2)2 + (x 3)2 = z1 z1 + z2z2

where we introduced the complex coordinates

z1 = l ei

z2 = l ei

inserting these coordinates, the s3 metric becomes

ds2 = dz1dz1 + dz2dz2 =

r + d2

l + 2 cos  drdl(cid:17) = l2d3

where   (0, ); r  (0, 2); l  (0, 4). as next step we consider the orbifold given
by the lens space s3/zk

making this replacement in (2) and taking for the harmonic functions h1 = h5 = 1+ q

z = p l we get in the decoupling limit (or near-horizon limit) exactly the same s3 metric
as before, but the consistency of a taub-nut space requires the periodic identication
(8).
what is the analogous orbifold for the ads3 space? as for the sphere, also ads3 is dened
as an hyperboloid, but now with two time-like directions

like the s3/zk orbifold is obtained by an embedding of a taub-nut space in the spherical
part of the solution, also the ads3/zk orbifold corresponds to an embedding of a super-
gravity solution, but now it is a pp-wave in the worldvolume part. in fact, as it has been
widely discussed in matrix theory [27, 28], (extremal) waves yields a discretization of a
lightcone direction corresponding to a quantized momentum number. a wave embedding
corresponds to the replacement

dt2 + dy2  dt2 + dy2 + (h  1)(dy  dt)2

= 2

s++s

(dy + s+dt)(dy  sdt)

(15)

with the harmonic function h = 1 + (r0/r)2 and s = (h 1 + 1)  h 1 (r0  k). after
this replacement and a shift in the radial coordinate (r2  r2  r2
0) the ads3 part in (3)
becomes
l(cid:17)2(cid:16)dy 

ds2 = (cid:16) r2  r2

dr2 +(cid:16)r

this is the (extreme) 3-d btz black hole which in fact represents an ads3 orbifold [7]. it
is locally equivalent to (12) and globally it is well dened as long as the lightcone direction
y  t = l in (15) is periodically identied.
therefore, one has the dictionary

(19)

notice, although both orbifolds are duality equivalent, they act very dierently. from
the worldvolume point of view, the spherical orbifold operates in the internal space
and leaves the external spacetime invariant. on the other hand the ads orbifold involves
the time or a lightcone direction and corresponds in the decoupling limit to an innite
momentum frame, as discussed in matrix theory. in addition, the periodicity introduced
by the orbifold corresponds to a compact direction with a non-constant radius r = r(r),
where r is the radial coordinate of the ads space. eectively this means, that in contrast
to a spherical orbifold, an ads orbifolds yields a running couplings.
let us discuss this point in more detail. orbifolds change only the global structure
(identications along a compact direction), locally the spaces are unchanged i.e. they
are still s3 or ads3. especially the scalars like the dilaton are not aected by this
procedure, at least not from the supergravity point of view. however, since the non-trivial
global structure corresponds to a compact coordinate the situation at hand is physically
equivalent to the case where we t -dualize this compact direction. by this t-duality the
dilaton will get a dependence on the radius of the compact direction, i.e. the non-trivial
global structure becomes visible. and since the radius of the compact coordinate is
not constant, the dilaton will run from the uv related to r(r = ) towards the ir
corresponding to r(r = r0), where the ir point r = r0 is dened as the maximal possible
extension while keeping the coordinate system3 at r = . therefore, the ir appears
either as further boundary of spacetime or as a horizon, see also [30]. to be conrete, let
us t -dualize the compact y direction. we obtain from (16)

with h = 1 + (r0/r)2, and we shifted the horizon from r = r0 in (16) to r = 0 by
r2  r2 + r2

ds2 = dt2 + dy2 + l2d2

3changing the coordinate system corresponds in the eld theory to an operator reparameterization,

which would imply a dierent rg behavior [29].

or if we express the dilaton by dimensionless (integer-valued) quantities, we nd in the
ir region

e2ir 

n
k

(23)

where k was the momentum number related to the orbifold and n is the number of
self-dual strings.
let us also compare this result with the s3 orbifold, where we have to embed the taub-
nut space in the transversal part. because the nut direction represents an isometry
direction, the d1-d5-brane system is localized only in 3 transversal coordinates and there-
fore we have to replace the harmonic functions by h1 = h5 = 1 + q/r. hence, making
the replacement (9) in (2) we nd in the decoupling limit where q  n is large

if in addition p is large the rst line becomes the ads3 space and the second line represents
the s3 orbifold. as for the ads3 orbifold we can read o an eective coupling from the
compact z direction, e.g. by employing t -duality. but this time we do not see a ow
behavior for the dilaton. the orbifold itself describes the eld theory in the ir region
and the constant dilaton reads

e2ir =

p
q 

k
n

(25)

where k is the integer parameterizing the nut charge p, which is related to the zk orbifold
(p  k). comparing this expression with (23), we see that the coupling constant has been
inverted. the strong-weak coupling duality between both orbifolds reects the fact that
upon compactication the wave and taub-nut spaces are s-dual to each other.

3 orbifolds of ads5

we will start with the discussion of a single orbifold ads5/zk and later we will comment
on the double orbifold ads5/(zk  zk). in comparison to ads3, the ads5 space has two
additional euclidean coordinates, i.e. it is dened by a hyperboloid in a 6-d space with
two timelike directions

l2 = (x 0)2 + (x 1)2 + (x 2)2  (x 3)2 + (x 4)2 + (x 5)2

the orbifold action on the ads5 space is dened as before, i.e. via the embedded ads3
space, see eq.(13). obviously at  = 0 we get back the ads3 space as given in (10) with
1/2 = rl

this solution is one example of topological ads black holes [31] (see also [32]), which are
locally equivalent to the ads space, but globally dierent. in fact, for  = 0 it becomes
the btz black hole with the two horizons at r = r.
it is not only a solution of 5-d
einstein  anti de sitter theory, but it solves also 5-d chern-simons with so(4, 2) gauge
group; which includes the gauss-bonnet term.
in the extreme limit both horizons coincides and to make the limit regular, one has also
to rescale  in a way that

but due to the  dependence of h it is not the standard wave.
to understand this solution better let us discsuss the general wave solution in an ads
space, see also [33]. the standard wave ansatz in an adsp+2 space reads (z = l2
r )

ds2 =

l2

z2h  dvdu + h(u, xi, z) du2 + dx2

where ~x = (x1, x2, . . .) and, as typical for pp-waves, one can allow for a general u depen-
dence; for a recent discussion of this u dependence in the ads/cft correspondence see
e.g. [34]. let us give some special cases:
(i) if h = h(z): the solution is h = h + czp+1, which corresponds to the expected har-
monic function with respect to the 9  p transversal brane directions (note z  1/r).
(ii) if h = h(~x): one gets an harmonic function with respect to the worldvolume coordi-
nates, e.g. a logarithm for the 3-brane.
(iii) if h = f (~x)g(z):
2 where
k(|p|z) is the modied bessel functions. at the asymptotic boundary (z = 0, uv
region) zk  constant and h parameterize a plane wave whereas in the ir (z  )
h vanishes.
(iv) nally if h = h(|~x|2 + z2): the solution reads

the solution becomes h  ei~p~x zk(|p|z),  = 1+p

h = h + c(|~x|2 + z2) .

(35)

for ads5 this last solution coincides exactly with solution obtained in (32) if |~x| = ;
0/l4. notice, that this regular solution is the same exact wave solution
z = l2/r and c = r2
which is also known from the at space case. moreover, this wave breaks explicitly the
world volume isometries; only the lightcone direction u, v represents still isometries.
by a simple shift in v we can absorb h and in order to avoid a conical singularity at
 = z = 0 we have to do a periodical identication along the lightcone direction u,
which corresponds exactly to our orbifold. this was also the case for ads3: for the non-
extreme case the identication is along a spatial direction whereas in the extreme case a
lightcone direction is periodically identied. moreover, this compact direction breaks the
scale invariance and since its radius is not constant, it corresponds to a running coupling.
again reading o the dilaton from this compact direction we nd e2 = guu = r2

e2 =

(36)

notice, that the -dependence drops out!
we can also compare this result with the s5 orbifold, related to a taub-nut embedding
into the s5. reading o the dilaton coupling from the radius of the nut direction, we
nd

e2ir 

k
n

(37)

where the radius of s5 scales with n and k corresponds to the nut charge which corre-
sponds to the orbifold. recall for this spherical orbifold we do not get a running coupling,
but only the eective value in the infrared (the compact nut direction introduces a
scale), which is again opposite to the value from the ads orbifold.
finally, let us also comment on the double orbifolds ads5/(zk  zk). because both
orbifolds appear in a democratic way, also the second zk factor corresponds to an em-
bedding of a pp-wave. because ads5 was dened as a hyperboloid in the a 6-d space

8

with two time-like direction, this space can accommodate exactly two independent waves
(a wave requires always a time-like direction). this agrees nicely with the spherical orb-
ifolds, which also allow for at most two independent orbifold actions. but reducing the
6-d space to the ads5 we loose one time and thus the second wave cannot show up as a
second wave in ads5. on the other hand from the f-theory approach to type iib string
theory, we know that the d-instanton corresponds exactly to a wave with respect to the
hidden time [11]. hence, the corresponding supergravity solution has to include a wave
as well as a d-instanton and it is straightforward to construct this solution. first note,
that the 3-brane metric (33) is the same in the einstein and string frame and therefore
we can interprete it as the einstein metric. in the einstein frame the iib dilaton e and
rr scalar l (s = l  e) solve the equations of motion if (see e.g. [35])

s+ = const., s =

1
h

,

(38)

where h is also a solution of the laplace equation (34). thus in the string frame we
obtain the metric

ds2 =  h

l2

z2h  dvdu + h(u, xi, z) du2 + dx2

1 + dx2

2 + dz2i .

(39)

the harmonic function h could be any the cases discussed after (34). for further discus-
sions of d-instantons in the ads/cft correspondence we refer to [36, 37]

4 discussion

in the near-horizon limit, regular branes factorize into an anti de sitter space and a
sphere yielding two distinct possibilities for orbifolds: ads  s/ or ads/  s. in this
paper we focused on ads-orbifolds and compared them with spherical orbifolds. both
cases correspond to an embedding of a supergravity solution: a taub-nut space for
spherical orbifolds and pp-waves for the ads-orbifolds. both the supergravity solutions
acts quite dierently, the taub-nut space breaks the r-symmetry related to rotations in
the transverse space and the wave breaks the worldvolume rotational symmetry. from the
eld theory point of view the r-symmetry is internal, whereas the worldvolume rotations
broken by pp-waves are part of the lorentz group. notice, pp-waves are interpreted as
gravitons with a given momentum and in the decoupling limit this momentum should be
large.
in projecting out the discrete subgroup, one has to truncate the spectrum onto an invariant
subsector. for both orbifolds one has to project out one chirality: for spherical orbifolds
it is one chirality with respect to the nut direction, as discussed in [25] for the 3-d
case; and for the ads-orbifold it is one chirality with respect to the momentum modes
corresponding to the wave. for the ads3 case the corresponding states are the chiral
primaries corresponding to momentum modes travelling only in one direction along the
(extremal) string, see [38].

9

finally, let us stress that the pp-wave yielding an ads-orbifold is in general not the
standard pp-wave that corresponds to a harmonic function. instead, it is the exact wave
solution that quadratically increases in the transversal space, see (35), and the periodic
identication, which avoids a conical singularity, represents the orbifold. so, this solution
breaks the translational invariance along the brane worldvolume (localized wave). only
the wave direction represents still an isometry direction and by t-dualizing this direction
one can construct brane intersection which are localized and supersymmetric.
