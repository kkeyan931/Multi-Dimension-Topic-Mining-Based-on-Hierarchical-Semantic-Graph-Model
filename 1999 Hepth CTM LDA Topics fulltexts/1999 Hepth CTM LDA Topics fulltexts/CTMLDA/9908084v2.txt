abstract

the partial breaking of supersymmetry in anti-de sitter (ads) space can be accom-
plished using two of four dual representations for the massive osp(1, 4) spin-3/2
multiplet. the representations can be unhiggsed, which gives rise to a set of dual
n = 2 supergravities and supersymmetry algebras.

1 introduction

most supersymmetry phenomenology is based on the minimal supersymmetric standard
model, which is assumed to be the low energy limit of a more fundamental theory in which
an n = 8 supersymmetry is spontaneously broken to n = 1. the goldstone fermions
from the seven broken supersymmetries are eliminated by the superhiggs eect: they
become the longitudinal components of seven massive gravitinos.

the physics that underlies this superhiggs eect is most easily illustrated by the
simpler case of n = 2 supersymmetry, spontaneously broken to n = 1. indeed, in ref. [1]
a set of theories were constructed that realized this partial supersymmetry breaking in
at minkowski space. these theories circumvent a naive argument that forbids partial
breaking by abandoning one of its assumptions, namely that of a positive denite hilbert
space. in covariantly-quantized supergravity theories, the gravitino m is a gauge eld
with negative-norm components, so the hilbert space is not positive denite.

the minkowski-space theories were based on n = 2 super-poincare algebras with
certain central extensions. in anti-de sitter (ads) space, however, the n = 2 supersym-
metry algebra is dierent. the algebra is known as osp(2, 4); the relevant parts are (see
appendix a),

ht ij, qki = i(jkqi  ikqj) .
in this expression, the qi
 (i  {1, 2}) denote the two supercharges, while mab and ra are
the generators of so(3, 2). the antisymmetric matrix t ij is the single hermitian generator
of an additional so(2). as the cosmological constant   0, the algebra contracts to the
usual n = 2 poincare supersymmetry algebra with at most one real central charge. (the
generator ra contracts to the momentum generator pa, while t ij contracts to zero or to
a single real central charge, depending on the rescaling of the operators.)

t ij

in minkowski space, partial supersymmetry breaking was found to require super-
poincare algebras with two central extensions [1]. the osp(2, 4) algebra contracts to
a super-poincare algebra with at most one central charge. this suggests that if partial
breaking is to occur, the ads algebra must be modied.

in this paper we will study this question using the same approach as in [1]. we will
see that partial breaking in ads space occurs for two of four dual representations of the
osp(1, 4) massive spin-3/2 multiplet. we will nd that the two dual representations give
rise to new ads supergravities with appropriately modied osp(2, 4) supersymmetry
algebras1. as the cosmological constant   0, the new algebras contract to the n = 2
poincare algebras with the required set of central extensions.

1a theory exhibiting partial supersymmetry breaking in ads space was derived in [2]. however, this

construction contains more elds because it has complete n = 2 multiplets.

2.1 dual versions of massive osp(1, 4) spin-3/2 multiplets

the starting point for our investigation is the massive osp(1, 4) spin-3/2 multiplet. this
multiplet contains six bosonic and six fermionic degrees of freedom, arranged in states of
the following spins,

it contains the following ads representations (see e.g. [3] and references therein),

d(e + 1

2, 3

2)  d(e, 1)  d(e + 1, 1)  d(e + 1

2 , 1
2 )

where d(e, s) is labeled by the eigenvalues of the diagonal operators of the maximal com-
pact subgroup so(2)  su(2)  so(3, 2) and unitarity requires e  2. (the eigenvalue
e is the ads generalization of a representations rest-frame energy. as e  2, the rst
two representations in (3) become massless, with eigenvalues (s + 1, s). the massless
representations are short representations of osp(1, 4).)

as in minkowski space, a massive spin-1 eld can be represented by a vector or by an
antisymmetric tensor. for the case at hand, there are four possibilities. the lagrangian
with two vectors is given by

where   0 and m is the ads covariant derivative. here m is a spin-3/2 rarita-
schwinger eld,  a spin-1/2 fermion, and amn and bmn are the eld strengths of the
real vectors am and bm. this lagrangian is invariant under the following supersymmetry
transformations,2

where h a
m = (e  1). this denition is consistent with the ads representations in (3). the fact
that e  2 implies that 0    1.
in minkowki space, other eld representations of the massive spin-3/2 multiplet can
be derived [1] using a poincare duality which relates massive vector elds to massive anti-
symmetric tensor elds of rank two. the same duality also holds in ads space where, for
example, the vector bm can be replaced by an antisymmetric tensor bmn. the lagrangian
for the dual theory is then:

two more representations can be found by dualizing the vector am. the derivations
are straightforward, so we will not write the lagrangians and transformations here. each
of the four dual lagrangians describe the dynamics of free massive spin-3/2 and 1/2
fermions, together with their supersymmetric partners, massive spin-one vector and tensor
elds.

in what follows we shall see that the rst two representations are special because
they can be regarded as unitary gauge descriptions of theories with a set of additional
symmetries: a fermionic gauge symmetry for the massive spin-3/2 fermion, as well as
additional gauge symmetries associated with the massive gauge elds.

2.2 unhiggsing massive osp(1, 4) spin-3/2 multiplets

to exhibit the superhiggs eect, we will unhiggs these lagrangians by rst coupling them
to n = 1 supergravity and including a goldstone fermion and its superpartners, and then
gauging the full n = 2 supersymmetry. in this way we will construct theories with a local
n = 2 supersymmetry nonlinearly realized, but with n = 1 represented linearly on the
elds. the resulting lagrangians describe the physics of partial supersymmetry breaking
well below the scale v where the second supersymmetry is broken.

in at space, a massive representation can be unhiggsed by passing to its massless
limit, where the goldstone elds become physical degrees of freedom. in ads space, the
massless limit corresponds to e  2. in this limit the massive spin-3/2 multiplet splits
into a massless spin-3/2 multiplet, plus a massive vector/tensor multiplet of spin one (see
also appendix b):

figure 1: the degrees of freedom of the unhiggsed osp(1, 4) massive spin-3/2 multiplet
coupled to gravity. the massive spin-1 eld can be represented by either a vector or an
antisymmetric tensor.

the spin-one multiplet with e = 5/2 (the normalization of e diers for dierent
multiplets; see appendix b and ref. [3].) cannot itself be unhiggsed because that would
require e  1. for the case at hand, this would spoil the unitarity of the spin-3/2 eld.
in figure 1 the physical elds of the massive spin-3/2 multiplet coupled to gravity are
arranged in terms of n = 1 multiplets. the elds of lowest spin form a massive n = 1
vector/tensor multiplet. they may be thought of as n = 1 matter. the remaining
elds are the gauge elds of n = 2 supergravity. in unitary gauge, the massless vector
eats the scalar, while the rarita-schwinger eld eats one linear combination of the spin-
1/2 fermions. this leaves the massive n = 1 spin-3/2 multiplet coupled to n = 1
supergravity. in contrast to the superhiggs eect in a at background, where an n = 2
multiplet emerges in the massless limit of the unhiggsed theory [1], the e  2 limit in
ads space gives rise to n = 1 multiplets only.
to nd the lagrangian, let us introduce a set of goldstone elds by the following
stuckelberg redenitions. for the case with two vectors, we include goldstone elds by
replacing

this result holds to leading order, that is, up to and including terms in the transfor-
mations that are linear in the elds. note that this representation is irreducible in the
sense that there are no subsets of elds that transform only into themselves under the su-
persymmetry transformations. the lagrangian (10) describes the spontaneous breaking
of n = 2 supersymmetry in ads space. it has n = 2 supersymmetry and a local u(1)
gauge symmetry. in unitary gauge, it reduces to the massive n = 1 lagrangian of eq. (4).
let us now consider the dual case with one massive tensor. the degree of freedom
counting is as in figure 1. note that the massive n = 1 vector multiplet now contains
a massive antisymmetric tensor.

the lagrangian and supersymmetry transformations for this system can be worked
out following the procedures described above. they can also be derived by dualizing rst
the scalar b and then the vector bm using the method described in [4]. the lagrangian

these elds form an irreducible representation of the n = 2 algebra.

each of the two lagrangians has a full n = 2 supersymmetry (up to the appropriate
order). the rst supersymmetry is realized linearly4. the second is realized nonlinearly:
it is spontaneously broken. in each case, the transformations imply that

does. therefore  is the goldstone fermion for n = 2 supersymmetry, spontaneously
broken to n = 1.

we do not know how to unhiggs the other two representations of the massive spin-3/2
multiplet. if we use stuckelberg redenitions as in (8, 9), the supersymmetry transforma-
tions are singular as   1. if we try to dualize the above representations, the procedure
is thwarted by the bare a elds in the lagrangians and transformation laws.

3 the supersymmetry algebras

to nd the supersymmetry algebras, let us compute the closure of the rst and second
supersymmetry transformations to zeroth order in the elds. this will allow us to identify
the goldstone elds associated with any spontaneously broken bosonic symmetries.

in the case with two scalars (13), the algebra is as follows,

[2, 1] a = 2

m


1  2(12 + 1 2)

4in ads supergravity, the gravitinos undergo a shift even for linearly realized supersymmetry [5]; see

(13,17) and (29) in appendix a.

1  2(12  1 2)
m(12  1 2)

2


(20)

from these expressions we see that a and b are goldstone bosons associated with
nonlinearly realized u(1) symmetries that are gauged by the vectors am and bm.

in the case with one scalar and one antisymmetric tensor, (17), the last two lines in

(20) are replaced by

[ 2, 1] bm =

2


[ 2, 1] bmn = 

1  m(12 + 1 2) + 2i

1  (1m 2  2m 1)

(21)

in this case a and bm are the goldstone bosons of nonlinearly realized u(1)s gauged
by am and bmn.

to nd the symmetry algebra, let us consider these algebras in the limit   0, with
xed v2 6= 0,  6= 0. this limit corresponds to a xed ads background, in which central
charges can be identied. for the case with two scalars, we nd

[ 2, 1 ] a = 2v2(12 + 1 2)
[ 2, 1 ] am = 0
[ 2, 1 ] b = 2iv2(12  1 2)
[ 2, 1 ] bm = 

2iv2 m


(12  1 2) .

(22)

(23)

for the case with one scalar and one antisymmetric tensor, the last two lines are replaced
by

[ 2, 1] bm = 2iv2(1m 2  2m 1)
[ 2, 1] bmn = 

v2
 [m(2n] 1  1n] 2)

2i

(24)

equation (22) implies that the real scalar a is the goldstone boson associated with
the u(1) generator of the ads algebra. (it is this generator which contracts to a real
central charge in at space.) equation (23) ((24)) indicates that the scalar b (vector
bm) is the goldstone boson associated with a spontaneously-broken u(1) symmetry, one
which is gauged by the vector eld bm (tensor eld bmn).

these results imply that when v 6= 0 and  6= 0, the full current algebra is actually
osp(2, 4)s u(1), nonlinearly realized. the symbol s is a semi-direct product; it is ap-
propriate because the supersymmetry generators close into the local u(1) symmetry. this
construction evades the ads generalization of the coleman-mandula/haag- lopuszanski-
sohnius theorem because the broken supercharges do not exist. the osp(2, 4) s u(1)
symmetry only exists at the level of the current algebra; the u(1) symmetry is always
spontaneously broken.

figure 2: the manifold of partially broken n = 2 supergravity theories as a function of
newtons constant  and the cosmological constant .

the supergravity theories that we have found depend on three dimensionful parame-
ters: , , and v2. since we are interested in partial supersymmetry breaking, we shall
keep v2 6= 0. we then consider the lagrangians (10,14) as a function of  and  only. the
dimensionless variable  = /2 + 2v4 is a particularly useful parameter, because the
limit   0 corresponds to the case of partially broken n = 2 supergravity in minkowski
space, while   1 approaches the massless limit of partially broken supersymmetry
in a xed ads background. the full manifold of n = 2 supergravities, described by
the parameter , is plotted in figure 2. the center region corresponds to the new ads
supergravities described above.

a prominent feature in figure 2 is the vertical line at ( = 0,  = 0). this line
connects theories in a minkowski background ( = 0,  = 0) with the massless limit of
theories in a xed ads background ( = 0,  = 1). the line suggests that there should be
a family of globally supersymmetric theories in minkowski space, only one representative
of which ( = 0) can be deformed to a partially broken supergravity theory in a minkowski
background. in contrast, a continuum of theories (0 <  < 1) can be deformed to partially
broken supergravity theories in an ads background.

indeed, let us consider the limit   0,   0 such that  remains remains nite. if
we write  = sin(2), we nd the following n = 1 transformations for the case with two
scalars (13)

(the case with one scalar and one antisymmetric tensor can be obtained by dualization
of b and bm; it is not presented here.)

the angle  can be interpreted in terms of models with a full n = 2 multiplet structure
[6, 7].
in these models, a necessary ingredient for partial supersymmetry seems to be
presence of at least one vector- and one hyper-multiplet, as well as the non-existence of
a prepotential for the special kahler manifold [7] parametrized by the complex scalars zi
of the i vector multiplets. it was shown in [8] that such models can always be obtained
by a symplectic transformation from a model with a prepotential.

in [7] the symplectic vector  for the special kahler manifold su(1, 1)/u(1) with one

complex scalar z1 = z takes the form

2

 1
i
2
iz
z

 = 





.

(26)

if we assume that the scalar z acquires a vacuum expectation value hzi  1, and we
expand the supersymmetry transformations [9] around this vacuum expectation value, we
nd that the angle  parametrizes the symplectic transformation that maps this model
with no prepotential continuously to the case of the so-called minimal coupling models
[10]:

of course, this identication of the angle  only holds to linear order in the elds; at
higher order, the model in [7] cannot be consistently truncated to our eld content.

4 conclusion

in this paper we have examined the partial breaking of supersymmetry in anti-de sitter
space. we have seen that partial breaking in ads space can be accomplished using two of
four dual representations of the massive n = 1 spin-3/2 multiplet. during the course of
this work, we found new n = 2 supergravities and new n = 2 supersymmetry algebras
based on the semi-direct product osp(2, 4)s u(1), where the u(1) is always nonlinearly
realized for nite .

a geometry of ads space

anti-de sitter space is the space of constant curvature r < 0. it has the topology s1 r3
and can be represented as the hyperboloid

xaxbab = 

1
2

with ab = diag(1 1 1 1  1)

in at ve-dimensional space. it contains closed time-like curves; therefore its universal
covering space is taken as the physical space.

in the spirit of nonlinear realizations, the coset spaces of anti-de sitter space and

osp(1, 4) are parametrized by the coset elements [11]

g(z) = o(3, 2)/o(3, 1) = eizmrm

g(z, , ) = o(3, 2)/o(3, 1)  osp(1, 4)/o(3, 2) = g(z)ei(1 1
with m  {0, ..., 3}. subsequent expressions are facilitated by a transformation to new
bosonic co-ordinates xm

3 (+ ))(qo(3,2)+ qo(3,2))

xm = zm tanh( 1

2z)

em

a = a(x)m

a with a(x) =

1
1  2
4 x2

with the above choice of the fermionic co-ordinate system, the co-ordinates  trans-
form like a lorentz-spinor and not like an o(3, 2) spinor. therefore, the components of
osp(1, 4) superelds do not transform like o(3, 2) elds.

the generators qo(3,2), however, are o(3, 2) spinors. they can be transformed into

o(3, 1) spinors q by shifting the factor5 (x) to the transformation parameter :

eiqo(3,2)

= eiq

hence the supersymmetry transformation parameter  becomes x-dependent [11, 12]:

m(x) = i


2

m (x)

(28)

the supersymmetry transformations of the gravitinos (see eqs. (13, 17)) is also mod-

ied by the transition from o(3, 2) to o(3, 1) spinors:

o(3,2)

m

= ms(x)

((x)m) = m((x)(x))

m = m(x) + 1(x)(m(x))(x)

m (x)

(29)

= m(x) + i


2

5here, (x) is the group-theoretical factor that maps o(3,1)-spinors to o(3,2)-spinors [11]; it is not

the cosmological constant.
