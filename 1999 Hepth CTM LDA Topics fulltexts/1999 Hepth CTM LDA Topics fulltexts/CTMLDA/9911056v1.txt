abstract

this is one of the new talents seminars at erice international school of subnuclear physics
1999 and looks at numerical studies of (2+1)d topological skyrme-like solitons; the baby skyrmions.
we explain the concept of integrable and topological solitons. then we introduce the non-linear 
model in 2d in order to discuss the 3d nuclear skyrme model. we explain that the baby skyrme
models can be viewed as a (2+1)d version of the skyrme model. we describe the numerical meth-
ods needed to study the baby skyrmions. finally, we present some results on skyrmion scattering
and our work on skyrmions with higher topological charge.

1 introduction to solitons

the concept of solitons goes back to j. scott russells discovery of great waves of translations
on the edinburgh-glasgow canal in 1834. he observed that a boat which suddenly stops creates a
single, localised water wave; now named a solitary wave. solitons are those solitary waves which
keep their identity after interactions. later work by boussinesq (1871), by lord rayleigh (1876)
and by korteweg and de vries (1895) shows that this solitary wave can be described by the kdv
equation:

ut + ux + uux + uxxx = 0.

(1)

the stability of the kdv solitary wave is due to the ne dynamical balance between the non-linear
and the dispersive term in the dierential equation. in 1968, muira, gardner and kruskal showed
that the kdv equation conserves an innite number of quantities of motion. the kdv system is an
integrable system. techniques like lax pair, inverse scattering and backlund transformations are
available and they enable us to nd explicit solutions. this makes integrable solitonic systems good
toy models to probe physical ideas; albeit not very realistic ones. the main weak points are: nding
integrable systems in other than (1+1)d, imposing lorentz invariance, adding a small perturbative
term without breaking integrability and ensuring the presence of annihilation processes for solitons.
(see [3] for an introduction to solitons)

the simplest example of a topological soliton is the sine-gordon model whose eld is described

by

l =  + (1  cos ).

(2)
the lagrangian is invariant under   + 2n, nz.  is an angle in eld space, the circle s 1. let
us re-emphasise our denition of a soliton: it is a localised nite-energy eld conguration which
keeps localised after interactions. the eld has to go to the vacuum suciently fast for the soliton
to be localised and of nite energy. therefore, we can identify the spatial innity in each direction
with one single point and compactify the one-dimensional space r1 to s 1. the eld theory of the
sine-gordon model can be described by the map

m(t) : s 1  s 1

(3)

at a given time t. this non-trivial mapping gives us the possibility to partition the space of all
possible eld congurations into equivalence classes having the same topological charge or winding
number. we can visualise this concept with a belt. we can trivially close it or we can twist one
side by 180 degrees and close it or we can anti-twist it by 180 degrees i.e. twist it by -180 degrees
and close it. we introduce a twist into the belt which cannot be un-done unless you open the belt.
topological solitons are very much twisted eld congurations xed by boundary conditions. in a
formal language, we get a non-trivial homotopy group 1(s 1) = z from the map of the sine-gordon
eld which allows us to add or subtract eld congurations. for example, if we twist the belt twice
and anti-twist it twice, we get back to an untwisted belt: very much like an annihilation process
in particle physics. the twist i.e. the topological charge is xed by boundary conditions and
conserved. further, we can easily impose lorentz invariance by only using covariant lagrangian
terms and work in any dimension by construction. the weak points of topological solitons are:
generally they are non-integrable systems, few techniques are available (only ansatze, topological
bounds, etc.) and a computational approach is required. the sine-gordon model is a very good
toy model, because it is topological and integrable at the same time: it is close to real physics and
exactly solvable. further, we can compare our numerical methods with exact results. (see [12,
section 2.5] for more details)

2 non-linear  model in 2d

the non-linear  model is described by

(4)
where ~ is a three-dimensional eld vector on the sphere s 2 i.e. ~  ~ = 1. we could also use a
complex eld w which represents the stereographic projection of the sphere. again, we have a map

l = 

~   ~

m(t) : s 2  s 2

(5)

which leads to the second homotopy group 2(s 2) = z. the existence of the topological charge
i.e. the twisted eld conguration representing a soliton is ensured by topology. however, we also
need to make sure that the soliton is dynamically stable i.e. that it has a stable scale. derricks
theorem provides a necessary but not sucient condition for stability:

de[ (x)]

d

d2e[ (x)]

d2

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)=1
(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)=1

2

= 0

 0.

(6)

the lagrangian is scale invariant and does not satisfy the second condition. a change of scale
does not change the energy. numerical simulations are unstable, because numerical errors change
the scale of the soliton without loss of energy. another important feature is the existence of a
topological bound, the bogomolnyi bound

if we were to extend the model to (3+1)d, the  model term would expand the soliton: another
term needs to be added to ensure stability. (see [12, section 3.2 and 3.3] for further details)

3 the nuclear skyrme model in 3d

in the early 60s, skyrme came up with a theory to describe the hadronic spectrum i.e. a theory of
mesons and baryons [13]. its lagrangian

l = 

~   ~  s h(

~  ~)2  (

~  

~)( ~   ~)i

(8)

is a straightforward extension of the non-linear  model plus the addition of a fourth-order term
called the skyrme term. we need to include this extra term to ensure stability according to derricks
theorem. the mapping becomes

m(t) : s 3  s 3.

(9)

in eect, the most commonly used notation is in terms of a coordinate set on the su (2) group
manifold. skyrme had the ingenious idea to construct an eective eld theory of mesons where
the baryons are the topological solitons of the theory. baryon conservation is equivalent to the
conservation of the topological charge. his ideas were put aside by the success of qcd in the
description of hadrons in terms of quarks. a crucial step forward in the understanding of qcd is
the emergence of the idea of connement. in qed, the running coupling constant decreases with
distance of interaction and a perturbation expansion is very eective. in qcd, the inverse is true:
only at small distance ergo high energy does the coupling become small and the quarks are free
particles. at low energies, people believe that the quarks form colourless colour-singlet states: the
hadrons. this must be true as there is no experimental evidence to the contrary. so far, no-one
has come up with a decent way of showing connement in qcd. the lack of a small parameter
to do a perturbation expansion is evident. in the mid 70s, thooft [14] generalised qcd to be
invariant under a su (nc ) gauge group. he realised that the quantum treatment of qcd simplied
considerably and it is possible to derive some qualitative statements in the large nc and low energy
limit. this comes from the fact that non-planar diagrams and internal quark loops are suppressed
by a factor of n 2
c . for large nc , qcd is a weakly interacting theory of mesons
with the meson-meson interaction of order n 1
c . for nc  , qcd is therefore a theory of
mesons which are free and non-interacting. witten [17] realised that weakly coupled theories may
exhibit non-perturbative states like solitons or monopoles. he showed that baryons behave as if
they are solitons in a large-nc meson theory. the derivation of eective actions from the qcd
lagrangian is an unsolved problem. the skyrme model is the simplest of a candidate theory for
the low-energy eective lagrangian of qcd. of course, one may add some higher order correction
terms. see [7, chapter 9] for a simple review on the relation between qcd and the skyrme model.
there are diculties surrounding the quantization of the (3+1)-dimensional skyrme model.
first of all, the quantisation is ambiguous, because the theory is not renormalisable. one can do
a renormalisation to a given order, but it will depend on the scheme. therefore, it is essential to
compare the scheme-dependent results with experimental data. in 1981, adkins, nappi and witten
[1] partially overcame these problems by using a spinning-top approximation; the 1-skyrmion i.e.

c respectively n 1

3

skyrmion of charge one is radially symmetric and rotating without deformation. eectively, they
only include the rotational zero mode of the 1-skyrmion. this procedure allows to quantise the
1-skyrmion as a proton and gives reasonable agreement with experiments. the numerical work
by braaten et al. and battye and sutclie [2] on the structure of classical multi-skyrmions, i.e.
skyrmions of charge two and more, supports further the idea that an appropriate quantization
around these minimal-energy solutions for a given topological sector could lead to an eective
description of atomic nuclei. however, the calculation of quantum properties of the multi-skyrmions
is very dicult, because these minimal-energy solutions are not radially symmetric, for example.
this is rather frustrating, for the claim that the skyrme model descending from a large n-qcd
approximation models mesons, baryons and higher nuclei is a very compelling one. there have
been various attempts to extract quantum properties, notably by walet [15] and leese et al. [6].
a recent zero mode quantization of multi-skyrmions from charge four to nine has been undertaken
by irvine [5]. reliable quantitative results were not to be expected, but even the correct quantum
number for the ground states of some nuclei, skyrmions with odd charge 5, 7 and 9, could not be
obtained. all these attempts rely on theoretical approximations like moduli-space or rational map
ansatz and mostly include only zero modes.

4 the baby skyrme models

the nuclear skyrme model has two big problems: quantization is ambiguous and very hard and
numerical simulations are computationally very intense even on supercomputers. it makes sense to
look for a (2+1) version. the baby skyrme model is a modied version of the s 2 sigma model and
the lagrangian is

l = 

~  ~  s h(

~   ~)2  (

~  

~)( ~   ~)i  v v (~)

(10)

the addition of a potential and a skyrme term to the lagrangian ensures stable solitonic solutions.
the skyrme term has its origin from the nuclear skyrme model and the baby skyrme model can
therefore be viewed as its (2+1)d analogue. it plays the role of a toy model to explore skyrme-
like properties. however, in recent years people have also tried to use the baby skyrme model
to model aspects of the quantum hall eect. further, in (2+1)d, a potential term is necessary
in the baby skyrme models to ensure stability of skyrmions; this term is optional in the (3+1)d
nuclear skyrme model. we nd the minimal-energy solution for topological charge one by using
the hedgehog ansatz;

~ = 


sin[f (r)] sin(n  )
sin[f (r)] cos(n  )

cos[f (r)]


 .

(11)

note that n is a non-zero integer (it is the topological charge),  the polar angle,  a phase shift and
f (r) the prole function satisfying certain boundary conditions. we end up with a one-dimensional
energy functional

the corresponding euler-lagrange equation with respect to the invariant eld f (r) leads to a

which we re-write in terms of the second derivative of the prole function:



f

= f (f, f



, r).

(14)

the prole function f (r) is a static solution of the baby skyrme model. these static solutions are
certainly critical points, but not necessarily global minima. however, it is reasonable to assume
that the hedgehog solution for topological charge one is the minimal-energy solution.

taking into account the s 2 constraint, the equation of motion is

a  (~  )a  2s[(
( ~   ~) a  (  ~   ~)a + (

(17)

we nd that the inverse matrix of k exists in an explicit, but rather messy form. the equation of
motion is a second order pde.

one drawback of the model is that the potential term is free for us to choose. the most common
choices are: v = (1+3)4 (the holomorphic model chosen so that the 1-skyrmion solution is w = z
(discussed in [9])), v = (1 + 3) (a 1-vacuum potential (studied in [8])) ,v = (1  3)(1 + 3) (a
2-vaccua potential (studied in [16])). except for the rst potential, no minimal-energy solutions
are known explicitly. the baby skyrme model is a non-integrable system and explicit solutions to
its resulting dierential equations are nearly impossible to nd. numerical methods are the only
way forward.

5 numerical techniques

we are interested in two kinds of studies: the minimal-energy solution in a given topological sector
and the time-evolution of congurations. we have used numerical techniques based on solving
the corresponding euler-lagrange equation. a randomisation technique e.g. simulated annealing
might be more eective in nding the global minimal energy solution: an initial eld is randomly
perturbed and changes are selected via the metropolis algorithm which accepts changes to lower
energy and allows changes to higher energies according to a certain probability. (see paper by hale,
schwindt and weidig [4])

we need (16) for the time-evolution and relaxation of an initial conguration and use (14) to nd
static hedgehog solutions. these des are re-written as sets of two rst order des. we discretise
des by restricting our function to values at lattice points and by reducing the derivatives to nite
dierences.1(as explained in [10], see also [11]). we take the time step to be half the lattice spacing:
t = 1
2 x. we use xed boundary conditions i.e. we set the derivatives to zero at the boundary.
we check our numerical results via quantities conserved in the continuum limit and by changing
lattice spacing and number of points. moreover, we compare them with theoretical predictions.

minimal energy solutions of the hedgehog ansatz the static hedgehog solutions
of (14) are found by the shooting method using the 4th order runge-kutta integration and the
boundary conditions imposed by the nite energy condition. alternatively, one can use a relaxation
technique like the gauss-seidel over-relaxation ([11]) applied to an initial conguration with the
same boundary conditions.

n . using the dipole picture developed by piette et al.

time-evolution and non radially symmetric minimal energy solutions the
time-evolution of an initial conguration is determined by the equation of motion (16). we are
using the 4th order runge-kutta method to evolve the initial set-up and correction techniques to
keep the errors small. we relax i.e. take out kinetic energy by using a damping (or friction) term.
we construct n-skyrmions by relaxing an initial set-up of n 1-skyrmions with relative phase shift
of 
[8], two baby 1-skyrmions attract each
other for a non-zero value of the relative phase; phase shift of 
2 for maximal attraction. a circular
set-up is crucial as they maximally attract each other and 1-skyrmions do not form several states
that repel each other. we have run simulations for non-circular set-ups, but either the 1-skyrmions
take longer to fuse together or they fuse into many bound-states and repel each other. we run
our simulations on grids with 2002 or 3002 lattice points and the lattice was x = 0.1 or 0.05.
however, for large topological charge, we need larger grids and the relaxation takes a long time.
the corresponding hedgehog solution as an initial set-up usually works well and is faster, but biased
due to its large symmetry group.

initial set-up: the initial eld conguration is a linear superposition of static solutions with
or without initial velocity; typically we use a circular set-up of n 1-skyrmions with a 
n phase-shift
between each other (for maximal attraction). the superposition is justied, because the prole
function decays exponentially. the superposition is done in the complex eld formalism i.e. where
w is the stereographic projection of the ~ eld of s 2 (see [9]). we use the prole function of a
static solution (typically of topological charge one) to obtain

w = tan(cid:18) f (r)

2 (cid:19) ein.

(18)

this equation holds in the rest frame of a static skyrmion solution centred around its origin and
dw
dt = 0. we may introduce moving solutions by switching to a dierent frame of reference. this
can be done by performing a lorentz boost on the rest frame of a given w , because w is a lorentz
scalar. it is important that the dierent skyrmions are not too close to each other. finally, the
dierent w elds are added together and the complex eld is re-written in terms of the eld ~ and
its derivative.

correction techniques on s 2: the integration method introduces small errors which even-
tually add up. in terms of the s 2 constraint, this corresponds to the eld leaving the two-sphere.
hence, we need to project the eld back onto the sphere. the simplest and sucient projections are
a  a~~
a. of course, the space derivatives may also be corrected.

where  is the damping coecient. we set  to 0.1, but most values will do as long as they are
not too large. another approach would be to absorb the outwards traveling kinetic energy waves
in the boundary region.

6 numerical studies

we present three numerical studies of the baby skyrme models.

 check for stability

it is important to check whether a solution of the hedgehog ansatz is a global minimum or not.
we have taken the exact solution of the rst potential and perturbed it by a scale transforma-
tion. the initial conguration has twice the size of the static solution. the skyrmion shakes
o its extra energy and radiates out kinetic energy waves. the stable skyrmion remains; the
stability of the 1-skyrmion is ne and it probably is the minimum energy solution.

 scattering of baby skyrmions

first, the holomorphic baby skyrmions repel each other and only scatter if you collide them
above a critical speed. skyrmions of the 1-vacuum and 2-vacua potential have attractive
channel and scatter in the same way. figure 1 shows how the two 1-skyrmions attract each
other, form a bound-state, scatter away at 90 degrees, get slowed down by their mutual
attraction, attract each other again and so on. this oscillating but stable bound-state is
an excited state of the 2-skyrmion solution. taking out the kinetic energy, the bound-state
relaxes to the 2-skyrmion; a ring.

 multi-skyrmion solutions

the holomorphic model does not have any stable n-skyrmions where n is greater than one.
the common 1-vacuum potential possesses rather beautiful, non-radially symmetric multi-

7

figure 2: energy density of a 7-skyrmion

y

x

skyrmions. they look like crystal with 2-skyrmions as building blocks. (for example, see a
7-skyrmion in gure 2.) the 2-vacua potential gives rise to a remarkably dierent structure
for multi-skyrmions. in fact, we show that the energy density of all n-skyrmions turns out
to be radially symmetric congurations, namely rings of larger and larger radii. figure 3
shows the relaxation to a vibrating string conguration (further relaxation leads to a perfect
ring). clearly, the choice of the potential term has a major impact on the formation of multi-
skyrmions and their shape. however, it is not clear what controls the structure. (see our
paper [16])

7 conclusion

we have studied classical aspects of the non-integrable baby skyrme models. no exact solutions
are known in general and we could only achieve our study by using numerical methods. we have
shown that the choice of potential term dictates the structure of the multi-skyrmions. however, it
is not clear to us what properties of the potential controls the structure. our numerical approach
is symptomatic for the increased use of computers in extracting valuable information from theories
untrackable by mathematical tools. numerical experiments are becoming a well established area
between real experiments and pure theory. further, the author is in no doubt that solitons will
play an increasingly important role in fundamental physics. monopoles, instantons and d-branes
are other examples of solitonic objects. physicists have two ways of thinking about physical systems;
in terms of waves or particles. solitons combine both fundamental concepts and are waves with
particle behaviour. this new concept is exciting and very appealing to theorists in all domains  a
new tool to use with the help of computers.

first of all, i want to express my gratitude to the directors of the school professors thooft,
veneziano and zichichi and prof. gourdin for organising an excellent and inspiring summer school.
i also congratulate prof. thooft on his well deserved award of the nobel price in physics 1999.
