we construct a class of solutions to the einsteins equations for dimensions greater than or equal
to six. these solutions are characterized by a non-trivial warp factor and possess a non-compact
extra dimension. we study in detail a simple model in six dimensions containing two four branes.
one of each branes four spatial directions is compactied. the hierarchy problem is resolved by the
enormous dierence between the warp factors at the positions of the two branes, with the standard
model elds living on the brane with small warp factor. both branes have positive tensions. their
positions, and the size of the compact dimension are xed by the dynamics of general relativity
and the contribution to the stress tensor from the zero point energy of quantum elds living on the
branes. one overall ne tuning of the parameters of the theory is required that for the cosmological
constant.

i. introduction

the work of arkani-hamed, dimopoulos and dvali (add) [1] and of randall and sundrum (rs) [2] has stimulated
interest in explaining the observed weakness of gravity (the hierarchy problem) using extra dimensions. the add
solution requires the new dimensions to have nite but quite large volume, which introduces a new hierarchy between
the volume of the compact dimension and the fundamental scale of the theory1. rs proposed instead ve dimensional
spacetime with curvature comparable to the fundamental scale, and showed that a massless graviton can be localized
to a 3+1 dimensional hypersurface known as the planck brane. in their setup the extra dimension may be taken
innitely large, and four dimensional general relativity still agrees to high precision with long distance experimental
measurement. the weakness of observed gravity is explained provided the standard model elds are localized to a 3+1
dimensional tev brane, where the graviton wave function is small. due to the exponential fall-o of the graviton
wave function away from the planck brane, the distance between the tev brane and the planck brane does not need
to be large in units of the fundamental scale. randall and lykken (rl) [5] have shown that an innite fth dimension
is experimentally quite consistent with such a resolution of the hierarchy problem.

in such a picture, it is necessary to introduce dynamics which determines the location of the tev brane relative to
the planck brane. if this interbrane distance is not xed, it becomes a massless modulus which leads to unnacceptable
cosmology [6] and experimental consequences. goldberger and wise showed that adding a scalar eld which propagates
in the bulk and has a source on the branes is sucient to x this distance [7]. several other suggestions have been
made for bulk dynamics to x the extra dimensional conguration [8].

in this paper we rst construct a class of solutions to the einsteins equations for dimensions greater than or equal
to six. these solutions are characterized by a non-trivial warp factor and possess a non-compact extra dimension.
we then study in detail a simple model in six dimensions containing two four branes that employs a metric of this
form to address the hierarchy problem. one of each branes four spatial directions is compactied on a circle of small
radius. the hierarchy problem is resolved as in the rs and rl models by the enormous dierence in the warp factors
at the positions of the two branes, with the standard model elds living on the brane with small warp factor.

in this model the positions of the branes, and hence the magnitude of the hierarchy, are determined by the dynamics
of general relativity itself without the need for additional bulk dynamics. the reason is that the theory contains a
compact dimension, in addition to the noncompact dimension r. the size of the compact dimension is in general a
r dependent function, which is determined from the einsteins equations. we argue that in general the component
of the brane tension in the compact dimension will depend on its size, due to the quantum eects of elds localized
to the brane. then a consistent solution to einsteins equations will x each brane location at a particular value of

r. this mechanism for xing the positions of the branes should be applicable to a general theory containing branes
having four or more spatial dimensions.

the spacing between the branes in our model can be large enough to explain the hierarchy without ne tuning.
both branes have positive tensions and the solution is free of singularities where general relativity might break down.
one overall ne tuning of the parameters in the theory is required to adjust the cosmological constant to zero.

ii. the ansatz, equations of motion and solutions

we begin by looking for solutions to the einstein equations in d dimensions, where d is greater than or equal to six,
in the presence of a constant background cosmological constant. we assume all sources other than the cosmological
constant are restricted to subspaces of lower dimension. hence our approach will be to rst solve the equations of
motion in the bulk to obtain solutions with a number of constants of integration that can then be adjusted to nd
solutions for several choices and geometries of sources.

the action in the bulk is

s =z ddx

g(2m d2

 r  b)

(1)

we label a general coordinate by xm where m runs from 0 to (d-1). we restrict our search to metrics of the simple

form

ds2 = f (z)dxdx + s(z)dy2 + dz2

(2)

where  and  run from 0 to d-3. the remaining two coordinates are labelled by y and z. here the warp factors f

and s are assumed to be functions only of z.

the einsteins equations in the bulk take the form

this has the form of a rst order dierential equation for f 

f . this dierential equation is straightforward to solve,
and we can then obtain f itself by performing a simple integration. we then use the result obtained for f in eqn. 6
and the problem of determining s also then reduces to performing a simple integral. the results are

f = f0ez[1  ce

here f0, s0 and c are constants to be determined by boundary conditions. in the limits of vanishing c and innite
c we recover the usual anti desitter metric. it is easy to see that in fact for any values of these constants the warp
factors f and s change very rapidly as function of z. in particular there are always values of z where they are changing
exponentially quickly. this suggests that these metrics are good candidates for a solution to the hierarchy problem.
it is possible to use the class of metrics above to nd solutions to the einstein equations for various source cong-
urations and geometries. in the next section we exhibit a potential solution to the hierarchy problem based on these
metrics.

iii. the model

a. the metric

in this section we limit our interest to a solution where the fth dimension y is compact and corresponds to an angle
in the higher dimensional space. we relabel y by  in this section and hereafter to emphasize its angular character.
the angle  runs from zero to 2. we allow the coordinate z to be non-compact and run from zero to innity.
it
corresponds to a radius in the higher dimensional space. we relabel it by r to emphasize its radial character.

the geometry of our model consists of two four branes localized in the higher dimensional space at dierent values
of r. their positions are specied by the equations r = a and r = b where a < b. they can therefore be thought of
as being similar to the surfaces of two innitely long concentric cylinders in the higher dimensional space, with the
regular four dimensions parallel to the common axis of the cylinders, the fth dimension going around the surface but
perpendicular to the axis, and the sixth dimension being the radius. (this intuitive picture does not account for the
fact that the space is curved.) the standard model elds are localized to the brane at r = a. the hierarchy problem
will be resolved by the enormous dierence between the values of the warp factor at r = a and r = b.

because the co-ordinate  is compact the four brane appears as a three brane at suciently long length scales.
the branes divide the space into three distinct sections; 0 < r < a , a < r > b, and r > b. in general there is
no reason for the cosmological constants in these three sections to be the same since the branes may be separating
dierent phases of the theory. in what follows we will assume that they are dierent and will associate the three
regions with three dierent values of ; 1, 2 and 3 respectively.

the solutions of the einstein equations in the three regions will be of the form of equations 9 and 10 but with
dierent values of the constants f0, s0 and c. we will give these constants an additional subscript i, where i runs from
1 to 3, in order to dierentiate them in the three dierent regions.

now the constant c1 is xed to be -1 by the requirement that the solution be non-singular at the origin. this
requirement also xes the value of s01 to be (216/5/(252)). to see that this choice does indeed smooth out the
singularity at the origin we rst examine the behavior of the the functions f (r) and s(r) as r tends to 0,

we then go to the cartesian coordinate system which is smooth at the origin.

f (r) = const + o(r2)
s(r) = r2 + o(r4)

x = r cos 
y  = r sin 

(11)
(12)

(13)
(14)

it is straightforward to verify that in this coordinate system the components of the metric and their rst and second

derivatives (which go into the ricci tensor) are smooth at the origin, showing that there is no singularity there.

the requirement that the metric be bounded at innity determines that the space outside r = b be anti de sitter.
this corresponds to setting c3 to innity while keeping the products c3f03 and c3s03 nite. we relabel these products
by f3 and s3 respectively.

we are now in a position to write down the forms of the solutions in the three regions. for r < a,

f = f01e1r[1 + e 5

2 1r]

4
5

s = s01e1r[1 + e 5

2 1r]

3

6

5 [1  e 5

2 1r]2

(15)

(16)

for b > r > a,

for r > b,

f = f02e2r[1  c2e 5

2 2r]

4
5

s = s02e2r[1  c2e 5

2 2r]

6

5 [1 + c2e 5

2 2r]2

f = f3e3r

s = s3e3r

(17)

(18)

(19)

(20)

the constant f01 is determined by normalizing the warp factor f to 1 at the position of the visible brane. the
constant s01 was determined earlier. all the other constants above as well as the positions of the branes a and b must
be determined by matching across the branes.

we now write down the action for the branes.

sb =z dxmp g((r  a)[lm1  1] + (r  b))[lm2  2])

here g is the determinant of the metric tensor in the ve dimensional subspace, 1 and 2 are the cosmological

constants on the two branes, and lm1 and lm2 are the lagrangians of matter elds localized to the branes.

the stress tensor for each brane has the form

tab = t 

ab+ < t m

ab >

(22)

where t  is the contribution from the cosmological constant and < t m > the expectation value of the stress tensor
of the matter elds living on the brane. we will be working in the semi-classical limit, treating gravity completely
classically but accounting for the quantum eects of matter localized to the branes.

assuming the matter on the brane is in its ground state, tab is constrained by four dimensional lorentz invariance

to be of the form

where 2 and 2 are constants associated with each brane that we require to be positive. the form of t  is more
constrained since it is proportional to gab, which would imply that 2 = 2 if the only contribution to t came from
the cosmological constant on the brane. thus the deviation of t from the gab form is due entirely to the contribution
from the matter lagrangian. in a subsequent section we will show that the contribution to the stress tensor from the
zero point energies of elds living on the brane lead to  6= ,. in general  and  will depend on the geometrical
factors a, b and c2 due to the quantum contribution to the stress tensor from matter localized on the brane.
now the einstein equations for the upper 5 by 5 block of the ricci tensor get modied in the presence of the branes

(24)

since we already have the solution in the bulk we can get the complete solution by matching across the branes.
the metric tensor is continuous across the branes but its derivatives are not. the above equation xes the jump
discontinuity in the derivatives across the boundary.

looking at the above equations we have three parameters c2, a and b which have to satisfy four independent
equations. hence a ne tuning is necessary. this is the ne tuning necessary to set the cosmological constant to zero.
once this ne tuning has been made it is straightforward to nd solutions to the above equations without singularities
where all parameters are of order one in terms of the fundamental scale m. however since we want to generate a
hierarchy we want 2b = o(40)  1. from now on we will assume that b is the only large parameter in the problem
and that it is therefore responsible for generating the hierarchy. subtracting eqn. 31 from eqn. 32 we see that

now in order to generate the hierarchy the terms on the left of this equation must be of many orders of magnitude
smaller than the fundamental scale. while this looks ne tuned it is in fact natural. note that from the denition
of  it is clear that if  = , then  = . but the dierence between  and  arises from the vacuum energy of
quantum elds localized to the brane (the casimir eect) , which vanishes in the limit large proper radius for the
compact dimension. if the spectrum on the hidden brane contains massless elds then this eect is the correct order
of magnitude to avoid ne tuning, as we discuss in section iiic.

equating the various components of the metric across the boundary xes the values of the coecients f02, s02,
f3, and s3. once again there are four equations but there are now four unknowns so there is no further ne tuning
required.

fig 1. plot of warp factor of compact dimension (circumference of circles) versus r (vertical axis), illustrating why we
call this the space needle metric. the apparent singularity at the top, where r = 0, is a coordinate singularity only.

this completes the determination of the metric. the warp factor for the fth dimension is plotted in gure 1. the
warp factor for the usual 3+1 dimensions is qualitatively similar, except near r = 0 where it goes to a constant. we
call the the space needle metric for reasons which are obvious from the picture. the next subsections are devoted
to analyzing the consequences of this solution.

to determine the eective four dimensional planck scale we concentrate on the higher dimensional einstein action.

when the two extra dimensions are integrated out this will contain the usual four dimensional einstein action.

sg = 2m 4

and consequently

(34)

(35)

(36)

rather than do this integral exactly we will be satised with an estimate. the dominant contribution to the integral
comes from the region close to the outer brane where the integrand is very large and the forms of f and s are very
nearly simple exponentials. for the purposes of the estimate we set 3 = 2 = a1 = m = .

this large exponent is responsible for the hierarchy between the planck scale and the weak scale.
next we analyze the spectrum of linearized tensor uctuations to see if it is consistent with the results of gravitational

experiments.
expanding

and substituting this into the lagrangian we get the following equation for the uctuation h in the bulk.

where m2 = pp and we are restricting our attention to modes that have no momentum in the compact
direction. these are expected to be separated by a mass gap from the heavier modes with nonzero momentum in the
fth direction.

the boundary conditions that h has to satisfy are h(0) = 0 at the origin and

(40)

clearly h = f is a solution of this equation with m = 0 by comparison with eqns. (5) and (6). this is the massless
graviton. there is a continuum of other solutions for all positive m2, as can be seen from the asymptotic behavior of
the equation. however to extract these solutions is not easy, because of the complicated forms of f and s. however
since we are only interested in order of magnitude estimates we can simplify the problem by considering instead a
simpler problem that retains the physics we are interested in. consider the metric

this corresponds to a solution for the case with no cosmological constant for r < a but the same cosmological
constant everywhere outside. this metric is at in the neighborhood of the origin, anti desitter outside a. it clearly
has a form very similar to the metric we are interested in for r  a, although unlike our case, the positions of the
branes are not xed and one has negative tension. in what follows we will assume the main features of the excitations
we are interested in are common to both metrics and proceed.

with this approximation the equation in the region r < a where  is zero becomes

we get an equation for g as a function of q which has the form of an eigenvalue equation for m2 with unit density

proportional so we can conveniently choose the constant so that g = h in this region. also q and q3 as dened dier
at most by an additive constant. hence for the continuum modes we merely have to normalize the solution for h for
r > b with respect to q3.

from this it is clear that deviations from newtonian gravity are highly suppressed at long distances.

we now explain why we expect this model to have the same physical implications as the model we started out with.
essentially for r >> a the general solution of both models will have similar form. the only dierence will be in the
magnitudes of the coecients a2 and b2. although these coecients are determined by matching in the interior their
order of magnitude follows from simple dimensional considerations. this then implies that a3 and b3 and hence the
normalization of the modes can be xed by dimensional considerations. hence the two theories will give the same
order of magnitude estimate for the the corrections to newtonian gravity.

because of the isometry of the compact dimension this theory contains a massless gravi-photona kaluza-klein
u (1) gauge boson. however no light or massless elds will carry non-trivial u(1) charge since they have no momentum
in the compact dimension. we expect that other than the modes we have already discussed, the remaining spectrum
of gravitational excitations will be massive.

a more careful study of the phenomenological implications of this model is left for future work.

c. stress energy tensor for a field localized to a brane

in this section we consider the form of the stress energy tensor for a eld localized to a brane having the metric
gab = diag(1, 1, 1, 1, 1) but in which the fth dimension is compact and has proper size a. we show that in the
ground state the stress tensor does indeed have the form given in eqn. 23. for simplicity we limit ourselves to the
case of a free scalar eld.

the lagrangian has the form

we are interested in the expectation value of the stress tensor in the ground state.

since the usual three space dimensions are innite the sums over momenta in these three directions can be replaced
by integrals. however since the fth dimension  is compact the momenta in this direction remain discrete, k5 = n/a

these integrals are innite and must be regulated in order to yield sensible physical results. we will use a pauli-
villars regulator, adding massive elds with appropriate statistics until all the divergences have been removed. (we
could get similar results in a theory with spontaneously broken supersymmetry.) we simplify to the special case where
the boson eld is massless. then all the divergences can be removed by adding three elds with opposite statistics
having masses m ,m and 2m and two elds with the same statistics which both have mass 3m . here m is assumed
to be some kind of cut o for the theory.

performing the integrals and adding the contributions from the various elds we get the nite but regulator depen-

when m  (1/a) we can approximate t n

the relative dierence between t 5

 must be nite when the cuto m is taken to innity and must vanish
as the size of the fth dimension becomes innite. we now estimate this dierence as a function of a and m when
the dimensionless quantity am is large.

to do this we attempt to replace the sum we are interested in by a sum of integrals. we begin by observing that

the integral below can be broken up into a sum of integrals over equal subdomains.

5 the rst term on the right has the form we are interested in. also notice that the other
terms on the right then involve fewer powers of k5 in the numerator and hence for the seventh term and beyond the
sums for individual elds are nite and straightforward to estimate.

now if p t is t n
p t can also be chosen to be derivatives to arbitrary order of t n

not well dened at k5 = 0. we account for this by separating this point from the sum and approximating the rest of
the sum by integrals from (1/a) to innity and (1/a) to negative innity.
to obtain a reasonable estimate we must expand in eq. 80 to at least seventh order in order to account for all
possible divergences as powers or logarithms of m . the calculation is straightforward but lengthy and the details will
not be presented here. the result is that the dierence between t n

this result for the dierence could have been anticipated. since the only counterterm allowed by general covariance
is the cosmological constant which contributes equally to both t n
5 the dierence between these two must be
nite and regulator independent in the limit that the cuto m is taken to innity. since for a massless eld a is the
only available dimensionful parameter the result follows. it could also have anticipated by analogy with considerations
of the casimir force in four dimensions.

iv. conclusions

we have constructed a set of solutions to einsteins equations in six or more dimensions, and exhibited a six
dimensional set up with one compact dimension and two concentric four branes. gravity is mostly localized to the
outer brane which has a large warp factor while we assume the standard model lives on the inner 4-brane, explaining
the apparent weakness of gravity in our world. the locations of the branes are xed and there are no unwanted
moduli associated with either the size of the compact dimension or the brane locations.

we do not address the important issue of how to obtain chiral fermions on the standard model brane. ordinary
dimensional reduction by compactifying the fth dimension on a circle always results in a non-chiral theory. one
simple alternate possibility is to have the have the standard model live on a 3-brane at r = 0. then it is only
necessary to have one 4-branethe planck brane. the metric is simply the a  0 limit of the space needle metric.
alternatively, it may be possible to generalize our mechanism to additional dimensions with some compactication
which does allow a chiral eective theory on the tev brane.
