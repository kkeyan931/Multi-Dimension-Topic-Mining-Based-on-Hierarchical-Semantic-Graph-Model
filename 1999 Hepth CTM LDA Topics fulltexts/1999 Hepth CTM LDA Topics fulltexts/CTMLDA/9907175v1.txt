1 introduction

string theory [1, 2, 3] is dened by the two dimensional non linear sigma-model

s =

1

4 z d2 (cid:26)(cid:2)ggijg + ijb(cid:3) ix jx  + r(2)(cid:27),

provided the following space-time interpretations (g. 1):

(1)

1. x are the space-time coordinates where the string is embed.

2. g, , b are the external background elds called the metric, the dilaton

and the torsion, respectively.

3. g is the world sheet metric.

4.  are the world sheet coordinates.

the governing principles of string theory is the world sheet weyl invariance
of (1), understood as a two dimensional eld theory. interpreting g, b and 
as coupling constraints the requirement of weyl invariance becomes equivalent
to the following equations:

where the s in (2) are the dierent beta functions for the lagrangian of (1)
and r,h are the strength elds of g,b.

one of the most interesting aspects of string theory can be already obtained
by direct inspection of the rst equation of (2) which present a strong similarity
with general relativity einsteins equations. more precisely we can dene as-
sociated with the string theory (1) an eective lagrangian on the background
elds l(g, b, ) such that the corresponding equations of motions

l

= 0 , i = g, b, ,

(3)

coincide precisely with the beta function equation (2). this eective lagrangian
is given by:

ge2hr + 4

h 2i

(4)

i =

1

22 z dx26

note that the this lagrangian is not dened in the canonical form of einstein
general relativity. to make contact with the more familiar einstein formalism
we perform a rescaling on the metric absorbing the dilaton into the new metric.
the resulting metric is known as the einstein metric or the canonical metric,
while the original metric is called string metric. the precise transformation is
given by:

ge

 = e/2gs

 .

(5)

the previous discussion correspond to the close bosonic string. the phys-
ical spectrum of this string contains a tachyonic mode with mass square 2
 ,
a massless state of spin two containing the graviton, antisymmetric tensor and
the trace part that is identify with the dilaton. on the top of this, a tower of
massive states with masses proportional to 1

 (g.2).

figure 3: world-sheet parametrisation

graviton and tachyon scattering amplitudes for this string theory are dened

in terms of vertex operators:

vtachyon = eikx,
vgraviton =  x x eikx,

(6)

at tree level these amplitudes are consistently dened for d  26, for d the
space-time dimension. at one loop level the requirement of unitarity implies
that d should be equal to the critical dimension d = 26.

a slightly dierent type of strings are the open string. in this case the regge
trajectory contains a massless spin one state that we can try to identify with
some sort of gauge boson. the denition of open strings requires to specify
precise boundary conditions at the end points of the string. if we want to pre-
served target space-time lorenz invariance we should choose newman boundary
conditions.

x = 0 |end points

(7)

with the parameterization of the world sheet as indicated on (g.3).

in addition the above type of strings allow us to decorate the ends of the
strings with additional information, the so called chan-paton factors, that we
can heuristically imagine as pairs of quark-antiquark transforming in the fun-
damental representation of some gauge group g. this makes for g = u (n ) that
the open string states will transform in the adjoin representation as it should
be for a gauge boson. in case we consider orthogonal groups g = so(n ) the
requirement for the gauge boson to transform in the adjoint representation im-
plies to introduce an orientation to the open string. gauge boson associated
with exceptional algebras can not be included on this way. this was one of
the main motivations for the discovery of the heterotic string, that surprisely

4

(a)

figure 4: one loop amplitudes

enough are close strings that contains in its spectrum massless gauge bosons for
the group e8  e8. gauge boson amplitudes for the open bosonic string can be
easily computed using the following vertex operators:

v = xeikx.

(8)

as in the case of the closed bosonic string, the open strings contains a tower on
massive states, with masses of order 1/, and a tachyon with negative square
mass. in gure (4) we have depicted some open string one loop amplitudes.
examples like (a) are planar, i.e. they can be draw in a plane, while examples
as (b) can not, and are called non-planar.

one of the deepest aspects of open string theory can be already discussed
from direct inspection of diagram (b). namely, from the standard scattering
theory point of view, what we are seeing is a scattering of open string with
closed string states contributing to the internal channel. in other words closed
strings appears naturally as interaction products of open strings. this simple
and basic fact of string theory should immediately ring a bell of any quantum
eld theorist. in fact we can always work out string theory in the innite tension
limit (  0) where we decouple all the tower of massive states. from the open
string point of view the result should be a pure gauge theory, while from the
close string point of view should land in pure gravity. we may wonder then,
if there is any residual eect of the string open-close relation that survives at
the limit   0?. this is a basic question that will allow us to enter into the
very recent important developments connecting yang mill theories and gravity
but before that we need to discuss another aspect of the open-closed interplay
namely the d-branes and t-duality.

2 d-branes and t-duality

let us star considering a closed string in space time of the type d  s1
r, with
r the radius of the s1. the extended nature of the closed string allowed us
to dene a new quantum number, namely the winding number of the closed

5

string around the circle. let us call it m. now let us consider the mass formula
for the closed string states after compactication on the circle s1 (i.e.
in our
example masses from the point of view of the observers in d):

m 2 = pp =

2
 (25

0 )2 +

4
 (n  1)

and

25

0 =(cid:18) n

r

+

mr

 (cid:19)r 

2

,

(9)

(10)

where  runs only over the non-compact dimensions, n is the total level of the
left-moving excitations.

this mass formula posses a very interesting and amazing symmetry dened

by:

n  m , r 
this symmetry is known as t-duality [4].


r

,

(11)

as it should be clear from the eective lagrangian (4) if we require not
only invariance of the spectrum but also invariance for the amplitude we should
change the dilaton eld as

 =   ln(

r
1/2 ).

(12)

the above example of t-duality can be generalized to generic backgrounds with
a killing vector. the t-duality transformation with respect to this isometry is
given by the so called buscher transformations [13]:

gkk =

gk =

1

gkk
bk
gkk

,

,

bk =

gk
gkk

,

g = g 
b = b 

gkgk  bkbk

gkk

gkbk  gk bk

gkk

,

,

(13)

where the letter k stands for the direction of the isometry. obviously the above
transformations are generalisable to more than one isometry. coming back to
our initial example, we note that for the bosonic string r  0 and r   are
in all aspects equivalents provided we interchange the winding by the momenta.
in practice what happen is that for instance in the limit r = 0 an eective
extra dimension appears due to the generation of massless winding modes.

for a while nobody ask, concerning this strange t-duality symmetry for
closed strings, the most natural question, namely what is the interplay between
t-duality and the already mentioned closed-open string relation?.

figure 5: d-brane interaction

intuitively the problem we face is quite clear. in fact for the open string
there is no winding number, so once we go to the limit r  0 we most expect
to end up with a d-dimensional theory (as usual in a quantum eld theory),
however open strings in interactions will produce closed strings and as we have
seen in this case we get a new eective dimension, on the above limit. so what
is really happening?

the rst answer to this puzzle is d-branes [5]. as we will see in a moment
open strings live in a d + 1-dimensional space time, but with the end points
attached to a d-dimensional region that we identify with the d-brane, more over
the closed string in the d + 1-dimensional space time will induce a gravitational
life for the d-branes that will appears as a real source of gravity. let us see
all this in more detail. as we mentioned before open strings are characterized
by the boundary conditions at the ends points of the string. the t-duality
transformation of (11) is geometrically understand as mirror symmetry on one
sector of the string mode expansion, this can be better seen by inspectioning
the close string expansion that solve the eld equation,

x  = x  ir

(14)

where z = e i and z = e +i. this expansion can be rewritten in terms of

7

1/t

figure 6: modular parameter

homomorphic ad anti-homomorphic functions as,

x  = x (z) + x (z),

(15)

then the t-duality transformation translates into a parity transformation for
the anti-holomorphic function on the above expansion,
x 25(z, z) = x 25(z)  x 25(z).

(16)

for the open string solution we have,

x  = x  ip ln z z + ir 

2 xm6=0


m

(zm + zm).

(17)

therefore using the same transformation as in the closed string sector we get
the expansion,

x 25 = x25  ip25 ln

z
z

+ ir 

2 xm6=0

25
m
m

(zm  zm).

(18)

therefore the boundary condition x 25 = 0 is transformed into  x 25 = 0,
that means dirichlet conditions at the ends of the open string. we can see
that t-duality exchange newman boundary conditions into dirichlet boundary
conditions. this implied that the ends of the open string are constraint to move
on a given hypersurface, that we called d(irichlet)-branes.

at this point we can come back to our previous discussion concerning the
led theory limit   0. in fact if in this limit closed strings are still surviving
them we should expect that t-duality in the eld theory limit   0 of an
open string will present somehow the phenomena of quantum generation of
extra dimension. we will come back to this issue in chapter (8).

figure 7: conformal mapping

as a warming up exercise in d-brane dynamics let us consider the d-brane

amplitude represented in (g.5).

up to numerical actors that will not be relevant for us at this point the

amplitude is given by:

a(y) = ()d/2z dt

t

td/2(it)(2d)ey2t/

,

(19)

where r is the dedekind function, y the space-time distance between the dp-
brane, d = p + 1 and t the modular parameter of the cylinder (see g.6).

we can adopt two dierent points of view to interpret the amplitude in
(g.5). from the open string point of view we have the open string stretched
between the dp-brane and a time evolution along the loop with the value of
the time equal to t. from the closed string point of view we have the emission-
absorption of closed string states with the time of the process given by 1/t.
both pictures are related by the conformal mapping described in (g.7). we
will be rst interested in computing (19) in the limit t  0 that is the regime
(see g.6) dominated by the contribution of light closed string states.

using the transformation properties o the dedeking function:

1
it

(

) = td/2(it)

and the expansion of  or 1/it   we get:

a(y) =(cid:20)()d/2z dt

t

td/2t(2d)/2ey2t/(cid:21) (d  2),

(20)

(21)

where d is the dimension of the target space time and where we have avoided
the tachyon contribution in the expansion of the expansion of r-function 1

in critical dimension d = 26 we get from the well known expression

1recalled that:

a(y)  (cid:18) 23  p

(is)|is = (e1/24(1 + e25 + ...

with the factor 1 representing the tachyon contribution.

figure 8: feynman diagrams

we can compare equation (23) with the eective lagrangian computation.
in fact (23) is a long distance contribution where we have keep only massless
dilatons and gravitons, therefore we should compare (23) with the tree level
feynman diagrams for the eective lagrangian in the einstein frame and a d-
brane coupled i.e. the feynman diagram in (g.8). the coupling in the vertices
in (g.8) will depend on the gravitational constant  and on the dp-brane
tension p that we want to discover by identifying the amplitude in (g.8) and the
amplitude in (g.4). in order to do this we need the lagrangian describing the
gravitational interaction of a dp-brane with the target space-time metric, the
simplest ansatz is the p-dimensional generalization of the nambu-goto action

s = pz dp+1

detge.

(24)

using this amplitude and identifying the string amplitude (g.4) with the
gravitational eld theory amplitude (g.8) we get the dp-brane tension formulae

p =

(4)11p

2562

.

(25)

in principle nothing prevent us from doing the computation of the amplitude
in th limit t  0. using again the amplitude for the dedekind function what
we get in this case is

a(y)  ()d/2(d  2)z dt

t

td/2ey2t/

.

after performing the integration we get,

a(y)  (d  2)

1
()d  (d/2)|y|d.

(26)

(27)

we should notice a few things concerning (27). first of all the only dependence
on the target space-time dimension d is in the irrelevant front factor (d  2).
this indicates that (27) reects only the dynamics on the world volume of the
dp-brane. secondly contrary to the case (23) the amplitude (27) is singular.

10

figure 9: rr vertex operator on strigs

concerning the amplitude (27) we can take the near d-brane eld theory

limit

y  0 ,   0 , u

(28)

in this case we get:

a(u)  (d  2) (d/2)|u|d.

(29)
the limit   0 of (23) can be nicely taken for the special case p = 11 that
correspond to the half dimensional brane in 26-dimensions. moreover or p = 11
it is easy to see that the dilaton exchange in the (g.8) vanishes.

3 r.r charged d-branes

perhaps the most interesting dynamics of the dp-branes appears in the case of
superstrings (for a good review of superstrings see [1]).

the hilbert space of superstring contains dierent sectors depending on the
world sheet fermion boundary conditions. for periodic boundary conditions,
both in the left and right components we have the so called r  r-sector. for
antiperiodic boundary conditions we have the n s n s-sector. the two sectors
correspond to space-time bosons. in the n s  n s sector we have the standard
gravity multiplet containing the dilaton graviton and antisymmetric tensor. in
the r  r sector we have also space-time bosons but this time corresponding
to the factors appearing in the decomposition of the product of two ramond-
vacua,

type a 8x8 = [0] + [2] + [4],
type a 8x8 =, [1] + [3] + [5]

(30)

with 8 and 8 representing the dierent chiralities. space-time fermions and
gravitons are in the n s  r and r  n s sectors.

11

r-r

figure 10: rr vertex operator on strigs

one loop modular invariance determines the dierent gso projections. at
this point we get four dierent types of superstring theories. for type (a) we
get type ii with two gravities and no tachyons, also type 0 where we have no
gravitons and closed string tachyons. the same for the type b strings.

what is the string meaning of the r r forms appearing in (30)?. this is a
dicult question from the world sheet point of view. the reason for that comes
from the fact that strings are not sources of the rr elds. the simplest way to
see this is to consider a string diagram as the one represented in (g.9), where we
have a r r vertex operator inserted in a string amplitude at zero momentum.
from the form of the vertex operator we easily see that the amplitude contains
a factor of the form

~kf1...n ,

(31)
for f the r r stress tension and k the momentum, hence vanishing for k = 0.
if strings are not sources of r r elds is not clear what can be the stringy
meaning of dening backgrounds with non vanishing vacuum expectation values
for r  r tensors, moreover it is not clear at all what can act as a source of
those elds in string theory. the answer to this puzzle comes again from the dp-
branes. in fact dp-branes are natural sources of r  r charges, the amplitude
in (g.11) where we represent the amplitude for the dp-brane emission of a
r  r quanta is now non vanishing mainly due to the fact that the world sheet
entering into the game in a disc, due to the dirichlet boundary condition on
the dp-brane world volume. in order to prove that the amplitude in (g.11) is
now non vanishing we need to invoke a picture changing manipulation [6] to
cancel the k in (31).

once we know that dp-branes are -or superstrings- sources of r  r elds
we can compute the type of interaction between parallel dp-branes mediated
by the interchange of r  r quanta. this amplitude will be exactly the type
of amplitude depicted in (g.4), but this time we will consider the contribution
to the cylinder of r  r states in the spectrum. if we choose a gso projection
implying space-time supersymmetry we will get exactly the same amplitude
with the reverse sing and with d = 10, the critical dimension for superstrings,

a(y)  ()3p(cid:18) 7  p

2 (cid:19)|y|p7.

(32)

now we would like to compare this amplitude with the corresponding feynman

12

vrr(k=0)

figure 11: rr vertex operator and d-branes

diagram in (g.10). in order to do that we need again to dened a quantum
eld theory coupling between the dp-brane and the r  r (p + 1)-form

pz dp+1a.

(33)

with the kinetic term for the r  r stress tension f = da given by

z d10xf .
by comparing the amplitude in (g.11) with space-time (32) we get the value
of the r  r charge density p for a dp-brane:

(34)

p = ep , p =

(4)3p

2

(35)

probing the bps nature of the dp-brane. the above forms for the interaction
of the brane with the r  r eld can be deduce from the equation of motion
that the open string on the d-brane background must satisfy [7]. the resulting
action is given by,

s = tpz dp+1 e q det(g + b + 2f),

(36)

where g, b and  are the pull backs of the 10d metric, antisymmetric tensor
and dilaton to the d-brane world volume, while f is the eld strength of the
world volume u (1) gauge eld a and tp =  e<>.

13

for the supersymmetric string theory we must extend the action to a su-
persymmetric born ineld type action, that includes chern-simons type terms
that couple the dp-brane to the r  r elds. of course this last part of the
action, in the leading term correspond to the coupling of equation (33).
to simplify the above action we can consider the background space-time
to be at, the dp-brane almost at and in the static gauge, hence giving the
expansion

g   + x ax a + o(cid:0)(x)4(cid:1) .

on the top of this we can consider vanishing antisymmetric eld b and that
2f and x a are small and of the same order. the resulting low energy
action is:

(37)

s = pz dp+1qdet g +
ym z dp+1(cid:18)f f  +

where the yang-mills coupling is given by,

(38)

(39)

the second term correspond to the dimensional reduction of the ten dimen-
sion sym action. once the fermions are include, the resulting action is the
dimensional reduction of supersymmetric n = 1, u (1) yang-mills theory in ten
dimension.

4 microscopic dp-brane string amplitudes and

metrics

before going into the supergravity eective lagrangian associated with super-
string, let us motivate from the previous discussion on amplitudes the form of
the metric generated by a dp-brane in the limit t  0 i.e.
2 (cid:19)|y|p7.

a(y)  ()3p(cid:18) 7  p

(41)

in the post-newtonian approximation we can think of (41) as a gravitational
correction to the at metric. moreover we can invoke the t-duality relation
between dierent dp-branes to look for an ansatz for the metric of the type

ds2 = 1

in the next section we will see that (42) is at rst order in the string coupling

constant g a solution to the supergravity equations.

5 supergravity as an eective theory

in this section we are going to talk about the supergravity description of dp-
branes. this kind of description involves the eective theory describing the low
energy massless states of the type ii superstring theories, where these massless
states are the graviton, the dilaton the ns two-form and the corresponding
r  r forms. an important point to consider about this eective theories, is
that their specic form is completely determined by requiring supersymmetry
on the massless spectrum just mentioned. therefore if the superstring theory
has a given symmetry, the eective theory should also be invariant under this
symmetry (supersymmetry acts as a protecting shield to quantum corrections).
actually the action itself doesnt have to be invariant under this symmetry, is
good enough to have invariant eld equations. recall that what we really obtain
from the beta function in the non-linear supersymmetric -model is the eld
equation for some of the massless modes. the other important point that we
should keep in mind is that because the dp-brane are bps states, some of their
characteristics are also protected from quantum eects, for example the mass,
charge and even the degeneracy of their spectrum, as we move on the moduli
space of the full superstring theory. therefore the low energy description of
dp-branes and bps objects in general is very important. in fact these solutions
are one of the most powerful ways to study the new dualities within the dierent
string theories.

the eective theories (for a good review see [9]) obtained from the type
ii superstrings are the type iia and type iib supergravity. type iia has for
spectrum the graviyton g, dilaton , the ns two-form b, and in the ramod
sector the one-form potential a[1] and the three-form potential a[3]. the action
in the string frame is given by

siia

= 1

g(cid:2) 1

22 r d10x(cid:26)g e2(cid:2)r + 4|d|2  1
4|f[2]|2 + 1

48|f[4]|2(cid:3)(cid:27) + 1

42 r f[4]  f[4]  b ,

12|h|2(cid:3)

where f[4] = da[3] + 12b  f[2] is the non-linear version of the 4-form eld
strength.
the type iib spectrum is given by the graviton g, dilaton , the ns two-
form b and in the ramond sector we get a pseudoscalar potential a[0], a two-
form potential a[2] and a four-form potential a[4] whose eld strength is self-
dual. the action in the string frame is given by

(43)

(44)

siib = 1

22 r d10xg(cid:26)e2(cid:2)r + 4|d|2  1
 1
3|f[3]  h|2  1

60|f[5]|2(cid:27)  1

12|h|2(cid:3)  2|d|2
42 r a[4]  h  f[3],

where we have ignore the self-duality condition of f[5] to write this action2.
the full non-linear bianchi identity satised by f[5] is now df[5] = h  f[3].
2 the self-duality condition for the f[5] makes very dicult to write an action for type iib

15

by combining this modied bianchi identity with the self-duality condition on
f[5] we deduce that d  f[5] = h  f[3], which is just the a[4] eld equation.
thus, the modication of the bianchi identity is needed for consistency with
the self-duality condition.

to study the dp-brane solutions of the above actions it is convenient to
consider truncations on the lagrangian that simplify and clarify the task of
nding out the right ansatz. basically we can always set to zero all but one
of the eld strength, living us we the following type of action (written in the
einstein frame for simplication)

i =z dx10

ghr  1

2|d|2  1

2(d+1)! ea|f|2

[d+1]i.

(45)

where a2 = (d  4/2)2.
with this lagrangian we are ready to look for solutions that are sensible
to be interpreted as dp-branes. the ansatz we have to consider in the most
simplied case is:

 asymptotic at space time.
 broken lorentz invariance from so(1, 9) to so(1, p)  so(9  p).
 a bosonic supersymmetric solution.

this conditions can be understand as follows: the rst item allows us to dene
the meaningful quantities that characterize a bps state like the mass, charge,
and supersimetric killing spinors. the second item assumes we are considering
the so called static gauge on the coordinates used i.e. the world-volume coordi-
nates of the corresponding dp-brane are exactly the same as the rst d = p + 1
space-time coordinates x. also implies that none of the conguration depends
on the above coordinates and that, in the simplest assumption all the possible
non-trivial dependence of the involved elds goes in term of a radial coordinate
dened on the perpendicular space to the brane, with coordinates ym. the
resulting form of the ansatz is given by

ds2 = e2a(r)dxdx  + e2b(r)dymdynmn ,

(46)
where r = ymym. for the dilaton we have only radial dependence  = (r)
and for the rr eld we have two possibilities, one related to the electric solution
and the other to the magnetic solution, the form of the ansatz for the electric
case is

fd+1 = dad ; a1.......d = 1.......dec(r).

(47)

for the magnetic ansatz we can only give an expression in terms a o the strength
led, as there is no global denition for the associated potential,

supergravity. in any case we can always introduce this condition as a constraint at the level
of eld equations

16

by now the only condition we havent used is the supersymmetry character
of the solutions. in forthcoming sections we will be dealing more carefully with
the supersymmetric equations, but for our actual proposes, it is sucient to
know that the constraints imposed by supersymmetry restrict the number of
independent functions from four (a, b, , c) to one, let say c. therefore using
the eld equations obtained varying the action (45), we get the electrically
charged dp-brane solution (in the einstein frame),

note that the constant integration kd, ko, co and the parameter g d are not
xed by this ansatz. also we have introduce a new constant d, which satises the
equation d + d = 8, being the worldvolume dimension of the magnetic solution
associated to a strength eld f[d+1]. to get the solitonic solutions, one replaces
d by d and set a( d) = a(d). this will give a d-brane magnetically charged.

where we expand the metric g as g =  + h. when we solve the mass, and
charges for the above metrics we nd that this solutions have the characteristic
relation between the mass and charge. also the electrically charge solution and
the magnetically charge solution satisfy the dirac quantization condition

edg d = 2n,

(51)

with n an integer.

a very peculiar fact about the electrically charge dp-branes is that they solve
the supergravity eld equations with sources at the origin, where the source
is the action of the elementary dp-brane (24) plus the coupling with the rr
potential. this fact allow us to dene the value of k,ed, g d in terms of the string
coupling constant and the string length , giving kd = 26d(10d)/2(6 
d/2)gld4
. four future discussions it is important to rewrite the dp-brane
metrics in the string frame, here we show the result:

for the elementary case, we have

e = h 1d/4

where  = 0, ... d  1, m = d, ..., 9.
the lagrangian of equation (45), as we just showed above, contains the class
of solutions to its eld equations, relevant for the dp-brane studies. this type of
lagrangian is not restricted to the ten dimensional bosonic sector of a truncated
type ii supergravity, in fact we found the same structure in the bosonic sector
of eleventh dimensional n = 1 supergravity theory. where the bosonic part of
the lagrangian is given by

s =

22 z d11xq g[r 

1
48| f|2] +

1

122 z f  f  a.

(54)

this time the eld potential is a three-form a[3], and we put hats on each
eld to dierenciate from ten dimensional variables. therefore the associated
p-branes solutions are the electrically charged m3-brane and the magnetic m5-
brane. their names comes from the idea that d = 11, n = 1 supergravity is
the low energy eective theory of the famous m-theory. in fact d = 11, n = 1
supergravity compactied on a small circle gives type iia supergravity in ten
dimensions, plus the relevant rr eld strength, coming as kalusa klein modes
on the dimensional reduction. this is part of the conjectured relation of type
iia superstring theory and m-theory. in any case the m-branes solutions of
d = 11, n = 1 supergravity are given below. for the electric m3-brane we
have,

r6 (cid:19)2/3

ds2 =(cid:18)1 +

as in the case of the dp-branes the constant of integration can be related
p and

to the relevant structure constant of m-theory, obtaining that k6 = l3
k3 = 222l6
p.

before nishing the discussion of dp-branes as solutions of the eective low
energy theories of superstrings theories, we should recall that there is a very
simple generalization to the above solutions which will be used extensible on
future discussions. basically we can consider what is called a multiple centre
branes solution i.e. a solutions representing a given number of branes, say n in
a parallel conguration. because the branes are all oriented in the same way,
the supersymmetry conserved is the same as in the previous cases. if we prepare
the solution such that each brane is located at ~ya (see g. 12) then the only
dierence in the brane solution comes in the form of the harmonic function h

h = 1 +

the following change,

|~y  ~ya| d

(58)

this solutions are relevant when we consider dp-brane congurations with open
string sectors including chan-paton factors. in principle this factors produces
a family of dp-branes, rather than a single brane. in particular strings stretch-
ing between dierent branes correspond to massive states of the gauge theory
dened on the world volume of the dp-branes.
if we start with n dierent
dp-branes all at the same place, we have a su (n ) (u (n )) gauge theory living
on the world volume of the brane. by pulling out one of these branes, we break
the group su (n ) to su (n )  u (1), and the mass of the associated w-vector
boson is given in terms of the distance between the bunch of n  1 dp-branes
and the pulled out dp-brane, r and the squared string length

|mass| =

r
 .

(59)

therefore we have a very nice geometrical picture of symmetry breaking on
gauge theories.

as a last remark we introduce the notion of t-duality for the rr-elds.
from the point of view of the string theory the t-duality transformation is (as
we said on section 2) a hybrid parity operation, this parity restricted to the
anti-holomorphic worlsheet sector is realized in the spinor space as the operator
i911 (where x9 is the compact direction). as the rr-elds are bispinors
dened by the corresponding vertex operator, its transformation is deded as,

therefore we get the nal relation in terms of the index of f as,

f = if 911.

f1...n = f91...n
f91...n = f1...n

(60)

(61)

the general form of the transformation in the case of non trivial background
metric nsns-antisimmetric eld and dilaton can be found on [10].

6 near horizon geometry

given a dp-brane metric

ds2 = h 1/2dxdx + h 1/2dymdym

with

h = 1 +

(4)(5p)/2()(7p)/2gn ((7  p)/2)

r7p

(62)

(63)

20

where r = ymym, the near horizon geometry is dened by the double limit
[12]

,

  0
r
 = u

r  0

(64)

with u arbitrary. using (64) we can rewrite the harmonic funtion h as

h = 1 +

(4/pi)(5p)/2gn ((7  p)/2)

u 7p()(7p)/2



(4/pi)(5p)/2gn ((7  p)/2)

u 7p()(7p)/2

(65)

geometrically we can think of (63) as a function dened on the (, r) plane. in
these conditions (64) denes a blow up of the point (0, 0) generating a divisor
with coordinate u . using (65) we get for the d3-brane the following near horizon
geometry,

ds2

3 = (cid:20)

e = g.

u 2

(gn 4)1/2 dx2

|| +

(gn 4)1/2

u 2

du 2 + (gn 4)1/2d5)(cid:21)

(66)

which is the metric of ads5  s5.
for a generic dp-brane we can write the metric in a similar form provided we
use instead of g -the string coupling constant- the yang mills coupling constant
on the dp-brane which is given by (39).

g2
y m =

1

422p

=

g


(2)p2.

(67)

note that the yang-mills coupling constant is also dened as the result of a
limiting procedure where g is sent to innite or zero, depending on the value of
p. using the above equation, the near horizon form of the harmonic function h
becomes

h =

y m n

dpg2
u 7p()2

(68)

where dp = 272p(93p)/2((7  p)/2). therefore we get the following near
horizon metric,
ds2 = (cid:20) u (7p)/2
du 2 + gy m (n dp)1/2u p3d5)(cid:21)
gy m (n dp)1/2 dx2
y m(cid:18) g2
y m n dp

u 7p (cid:19)(3p)/4

e = 22pg2

gy m (n dp)1/2

.

(69)

how should we interpret there near horizon geometries? (to nd a more
complete list of reference and a deeper introduction see [8]). since we are per-
forming the   0 limit we can think of these geometries as related somehow
to the pure yang-mills theory living on the dp-brane. we can try to establish
this relation from 3 dierent points of view.

21

1. gauge singlets: the main idea underlying this approach will consist in
looking for an isomorphism between gauge singlets of the gauge theory on
the dp-brane and the spectrum of supergravity dened on the near horizon
geometry. since supergravity is not a complete theory we should look for
its string ancestor on the near horizon geometry background. supergravity
approximation will be good if the curvature of the near horizon geometry
is large in string units, which in general will implies to take a large n
number of branes.

notice that the standard open-closed relation in string theory always al-
lows to think of the closed gravitational sector in terms of gauge singlets
of the open string theory. the problem is to nd a limit where the closed
string spectrum precisely describes the physics of the gauge singlets (glue-
balls) of the eld theory limit   0 of the open string sector.

2. renormalization group: in this approach we start by identifying the
blow up variable u with the renormalization group scale of the gauge
theory. the direct connection between string theory on the near horizon
geometry and the pure yang-mills theory on the dp-brane in the   0
limit, will be identifying the renormalization group equation of the eld
theory with the dilaton behaviour dictated by the dp-brane near horizon
geometry through the string beta function equations.

3. matching of symmetries: a more concrete procedure to nd a relation
between the near horizon geometry and the pure yang-mills theory is by
matching the symmetries of the yang-mills theory with the isometries of
the near horizon geometry. the relevant data for the yang-mills theory are
their supersymmetries and global r-symmetries. from the supergravity
point of view we should consider the corresponding superalgabra.

let us consider the sinplest case of the d3-brane. the corresponding super-
yang-mills theory is d = 4, n = 4. this is a theory with 16 supersymmetries
and conformal invariance that is described by the superconformal n = 4 super-
algebra. as we will see in the next section, the matching with the near horizon
symmetries comes from the fact that in ads5  s5 we get an enhancement of
supersymmetry.
from the point of view of the renormalization group the matching is in this
case trivial since on one side we have  = 0 and on the other a constant dilaton.
the most dicult aspect is of course the correspondence between gauge sin-
glest and supergravity elds. here the geometry of ads space time is specially
important. in fact we will look for a correspondence between supergravity elds
i and gauge singlets observable i of super-yang-mills theory is d = 4, n = 4
in such a way that i at the boundary of ads5 can act as a source for the
operators i through an interaction term of the type,

z dx4 i(x)i(x)

(70)

with i(x, u ) the boundary value of i(x, u ).

22

the operator i can be characterized by their conformal weight i hence we
need i to have dimensions of the type [lenght]i4. this condition xes the
mass of the eld i to be determined by the following relation,

i = 2 +p1 + r2m2

(71)

for r the ads5 radius. once we have this correspondence between ads5 elds
i and the observable i of super-yang-mills theory is d = 4, n = 4 the recipe
for computation of the amplitudes is given by,

her dx4 i(x) i(x)issy m = essugra(i(x,u))

(72)
with i(x, u ) |u=0= i. relation (72) is of course valid as long as the ads5
it is conjectured that string corrections to the r.h.s.
radius is large enough.
of equation (72) still reproduce ssym dynamics, but for the time being this
conjecture has not been proved.

in summary the correspondence between ads5 s5 supergravity and super-
yang-mills theory is d = 4, n = 4 is based on two facts: i) the isomorphism
of superalgebras for n = 4 ssym and n = 8 ads5 supergravity, isomorphism
that actually depends on the enhancement of supersymmetry in ads5 and ii)
the special structure of the conformal innity of ads5, which is isomorphic to
four dimensional minkowski space time. how to extend this picture to non-
conformal cases is an interesting open problem. most likely the starting point
in trying to solve this problem will consist in a systematic string reinterpretation
of quantum eld theory renormalization group equations.

7 supersymmetry

m-branes and dp-branes are known to be bps states. that is to say that
saturate a bogoumoly inequality relating their mass and charge. in turns this
imply that the supersymmetry preserved by this objects is a fraction of the
maximal supersymmetry appearing on the theory. in this case we have only 16
real supercharges or 1/2 of the maximal number of real supercharges that is 32
for d = 11 , n = 1 supergravity and d = 10 , n = 2 supergravity. a nice way
to see why we have this relation between bps states and fractional number of
the maximal supersymmetry conserved, is to look on the superalgebra of the
above theories at innity (where we can dened mass and charge, associated
with the poincare group). the general form of this superalgebra is, in the
presence of branes given skematically by

{q, q} = m pm + m0...mpzm0...mp,

(73)

where p is the momentum and z is form dening the charge carried by the
brane. the bps status of the brane tell us that the mass and the charge are
equal, therefore in static congurations we get

{q, q} = m(1  0...p),

(74)

23

clearly the eigenspinors of {q, q} satisfy
0...p

0 = 
0 .

(75)

the operator 0...p squares to the identity and is trassless. therefore the number
of independent eigenvalues is one half of the maximum possible, in other words
16.

we can see the above mechanism in the supergravity solutions of the branes
in the type ii supergravity case the supersymmetry

that we study before.

where we have used the split m = (, r, ) where (r, ) are perpendicular coordi-
nates to the brane, also  is a 32-component spinor, and  is the spin connection
[16]. note that we have on propose leave the dilaton unspecied in terms of h.
the rst thing to note about this system of equation as is that for the d3-
brane case the dilatino equation is satised independently of the type of spinor
consider, therefore we are left with only the gravitino constraints 3. this is a
consequence of the fact that in this case the dilaton is constant. for the other
dp-branes the dilaton equation is present and the solutions are dilatonic.

the dilatino equation is is up to multiplicative factors the projector operator
appearing on equation (74), therefore its presence implies the breaking of 1/2
of supersymmetry. also note that the gravitino equation on the worldvolume
coordinates is proportional to the same projector up to a additive factor of
the form . the last equation referring to the gravitino components on the
perpendicular space doesntt correspond to to the full projector but just the

3this case is similar to the m2-brane and the m5-branes, where the supersymmetry equa-

tions are written in terms of the gravitino constraints only (in d = 11 there is no dilatino)

part showed on equation (75) plus a partial derivative on the perpendicular
direction. the solution of this equations is obtained by assuming no dependence
on the worldvolume coordinates plus using the eigenspinors dened on equation
(75), giving the result

 = h 1/80.

(80)

where 0 satised that 0 = 0...p
supercharges.



. hence we get only the expected 16 real

lets next consider the case for the near horizon geometries obtained from
the dp-branes solutions. at rst this question could be consider a bit trivial,
after all we are talking about dp-brane solutions in certain regions, and we
already know the bps structure of this type of solutions. nevertheless note
that the near horizon limit change the asymptotic structure of the metrics. in
those cases we lost the minkowski structure and the relation with the poincare
invariants like the mass. the argument showed at the beginning of this section
simply doesnt applied to this situation.

to study the supersymmetry properties of these near horizon geometries we
start with the equation (79. our goal is to dene the near horizon limit of this
set of equations. for the gravitino equations, the limiting recepee is quite simple
due to the fact that the gravitino supersymmetry variations are components of
a one-form, therefore we have an geometrical object where to dene the near
horizon limit, basically

   limn h () = limn h(cid:0)dxm m(cid:1) = limn h(cid:0)dxm(cid:1) limn h (m ) ,

(81)

hence we get

8h 3

u[ + 0...p



],

u = u (cid:18) uh

8h (cid:19) 0...p



,

(82)

where h = g2
y m /u 7p. on the other hand the dilatino equation is a bit more
subtle, as it is a scalar from the point of view of ten dimensional supergravity.
we can dene its near horizon limit by consider the dilatino variation as part
of the relevant gravitino in a higher dimensional theory like eleventh or twelve
dimensional dimensional supergravity. once this is done the resulting near
horizon limit is,

 = 1/6(cid:20) (3  p)(uh)u

4h

5
4

[ + 0...p



](cid:21) .

(83)

in this case the dilatino equation goes to zero in the near horizon limit,
giving no constraints. nevertheless the consistency conditions corresponding to
the gravitino equation, contains the dilatino equation among others. after the

25

usual decomposition of the killing spinors, dened by the canonical projector
on this ansatz, we nd that one half of the supersymmetry is always preserved
if the dilatino constraint is satised , but the other half is conserved only if the
function h, behaves as

1
u 4 ,

h 

(84)

therefore we found the possibility of enhancement for p = 3 only. the killing
spinors equation found in this case corresponds to the ads equation

(85)

(86)

the m-theoretical cases go along the same line of reasoning as before, here
we show in detail the m2-brane only. the supersymmetry transformation for
the gravitino in eleventh dimensions give,

 m = m

where m, n, o refers to einstein index and a, b, c refers to lorenz index, e is
the elfvien and ab
m is the spin connection. also we have hatted the variables to
avoid confusion with ten dimensional variables. after solving for the m2-brane
ansatz we get,

the solution for this system of equations is again of the form,

(88)

(89)

where 0 is a constant spinor with only the expected 16 real degrees of freedom.
to study the the supersymmetries in the near horizon limit for the eleventh

on the killing spinor equation

8 t-duality and near horizon geometries

one of the questions that naturally arise, once we have a duality between qft
and string theory on given backgrounds, is the meaning of pure stringy sym-
metries from the point of view of the qft. for example in the celebrated
ads/cft correspondence the sl(2, z) s-duality of the type iib-string can
be interpreted as the string version of the well known monton olive sl(2, z)
duality of n = 4 sym [11]. the quantum eld theory meaning of t-duality
is however a bit less clear since t-duality interpolates dierent d-branes and
therefore tends to dene maps between yang mills theories in dierent dimen-
sions. moreover t-duality transformation generally produce explicit breaking
of supersymmetry.

the simplest possible way to address this questions on t-duality in a purely
quantum eld theoretical framework is of course by dening the quantum eld
theory using the near horizon limit of d-branes metrics and working out in this
limit t-duality transformations.

to begin with, let us start considering a d3-brane living in a ten dimensional
space time with one of the orthogonal coordinates compactied on a circle s1
of radius r. the corresponding metric is given by

ds2
3 = h(r, r)1/2(dx2
e = g,

||) + h(r, r)1/2(d(r)2 + dr2 + r2d4)

(91)

with x|| standing for world volume coordinates and the harmonic function h
given by

h(r, r) = 1 + gl4
s

n

xn=1xni (cid:18)

[(y9  yn9 + n9r)2+ | r  rn |2]4/2(cid:19) ,

qn

(92)

where g is the string coupling constant, ls is the string length, qn is the charge
of the d3-brane, r is the radius of the circle s1 and r is the radius on spherical
coordinates for the 5 space time. from now on we will ignore any constant
and will work with meaningful variables on the discussion, and always at large
n.

at distances much longer than r, we can poisson resume the expression (92)

obtaining

h(r, r) = 1 +

l4
sg
rr3 .

(93)

this is a good solution as far as r is small enough.

i we are interested in the near horizon limit [12] of this metric we would be

forced to dened this limit by performing a double blow up, namely

(cid:18)  0 , u 

r
 = constant

,

v 

r

 = constant(cid:19) .

(94)

notice that the new variable v correspond properly speaking to a blow up of
the point r = 0 in the moduli of the target space time metric (91) with the

27

harmonic function of (93). after performing the blow up (94) we get the metric

space time (95) is that o a bration of a circle s1 and a sphere s4 on the space
dened on the coordinates (x, u ) with the corresponding radius

rs1 = (

rs4 = (

gv3
u 3 )1/4,
gu
)1/4,
v

(96)

which depend on the moduli v. it is easy to see that this space time admits only
16 real supercharges, the simples way to understand this is observing that 1
2 of
the killing spinors for the near horizon geometry of the d3-brane are projected
out once we compactify a transverse direction (we will come back to this point
later on).

from the qft point of view we should expect the metric (95) to be related
to a sym in 3 + 1 with 16 real supercharges and with a peculiar r-symmetry
given by the isometries of s4  s1. the type of strings living on the space time
(95) is type iib.
consider next the candidate for a t-dual geometry, namely the d4-brane
compactied on a s1 of radius r, on its world volume. this solutions is given
by

e = gh 1/4,

with x|| expanding the non-compact four dimensional part of the world volume
of the d4-brane, and the corresponding harmonic function

note that this time the dilaton is not constant. the number of supersymmetries
in this brane is again 16 real supercharges, however the qft interpretation is a
bit dierent, in this case we have a d = 5 sym theory living on 4  s1. the
corresponding radius of the four-sphere and the circle are

before proceeding any further, let us clarify the picture we have (see g. 13).
in the d3-brane case we obtained the near horizon geometry as the result of
a limit where it was left one of the moduli g constant but we allowed r to
varied such that, at r = 0 we create a divisor v. this two variables dene our
moduli (v, g). the resulting geometry is that of a base space expanded by the
coordinates (x, u ) and bers s4 and s1 with the radius of equation (96). in the
d4-brane, we obtained the near horizon geometry as the result a another limit
where one of the moduli r is maintained constant while the other g varies such
that at innite point we create a new divisor g5. this two variables dene the
new moduli (r, g5). again the geometry obtained is that of a base manifold
expanded by the coordinates (x, u ) and bers s4 and s1 with the radius of
equation (101). in order to identify both metrics (94,100) by t-duality we most
require the following relation between the dierent moduli,

g =

g2
5
r

,

29

v =

1
r

.

(102)

provided that this relation holds, we can perform the t-duality transformation
following the normal buscher rules [13]. in principle we could run into diculties
if there appears to many singular point on the bration, so that t-duality could
loose its natural meaning. this t-dual map is well dened all over the base
manifold, actually we only have singularities at u = 0 and u =  but both
points are related rather to wrong coordinate patches than real singularities.
therefore this t-dual map is a very trivial example of ber-wise t-duality [14].
the map described above is dened by t-duality, and eectively acts between
the two moduli.

by now we have a neat relation between the bare coupling constants of both
gauge theories in the two near horizon metrics. on the other hand it is usually
associated to the dilaton behavior, the value of the corresponding running cou-
pling constant i.e. the eective gauge coupling constant. therefore to obtain
the eective coupling of the compactied gauge theory on the world volume
of the d4-brane, we considered the ratio of the eective coupling constant of
the ve dimensional gauge theory g5 squared, with the eective radius of com-
pactication namely the radius of the s1 given on equation (101), hence we
get

g2
4ef f 

g2
5ef f
ref f

.

then after solving for the moduli variables (v, g) we obtain

g2
4ef f = g.

(103)

(104)

therefore the eective coupling constant of the gauge theory we are studying
from the point of view of the near horizon d4-brane has the same running as
the the gauge theory on the near horizon d3-brane, as it should be expected
invoking its duality relation. note that the equation (103) was obtained by
plausibly physical relations, however this equation is nothing more than the
changing rule for the dilaton under t-duality!.

on the other hand the super yang mills theory on the d4 brane is not
renormalizable, we can trust it only at low energies. this aspect of the gauge
theory can be seen from the gravitational point of view. note that for this
geometry (100) the dilaton grows for large u . actually, we can trust on this
solution as long as u  1/g2
5, after this point we should think in terms of
m-theory.

the other possibility we have is to consider the d3-brane wrapped on a circle

s1 of radius r. this time the near horizon geometry is dened by the limit

(cid:16)  0 , u 

 = constant(cid:17) ,

r

(105)

where (g, r) are kept constant on the process. note that this time we dont
have the double blow up of the above cases. the resulting metric is given by

(106)

again the dilaton is constant, and the topology is that of a bration of a circle
s1 and the sphere s5, on the space dened by the coordinates (x, u ), with the
corresponding radius

rs1 =

u r
g1/4 ,
rs5 = g1/4.

(107)

this conguration also only admits 16 real supercharges. the situation on the
eld theory should be that of a d = 4 sym theory living on 3  s1 with 16
real supercharges and r-symmetry contained on so(6).
the t-dual near horizon background is the result of rst, a poisson resume
of the d2-brane solution with a transverse direction compactied on a small
circle s1 of radius r, second its near horizon limit dened by the triple blow
up, here showed

(109)

this time we have space time with 16 real supercharges, the metric denes
a bration on a circle s1 and the sphere s5 on the base space expanded by
the coordinates (x, u ) and the eld theory point of view should be that of a
sym theory on 2 + 1 dimensions, with 16 real supercharges, and r-symmetry
contained in s0(6)  u (1). the corresponding radius of the bers are

similar remarks about the validity of t-duality of the d3-brane and the d4-
brane are applicable to this case.

in general, we can consider the above type of compactication of the d3-
brane on a t 3s, which take us to the near horizon d(s)-brane on a t 3s
in the perpendicular coordinates. the metric of these geometries looks like
adss+2  s5  t 3s. when the holography map between the gauge theories
and the bulk geometries is dened 4, the radius of the torus is very small. also
we found that when r   we recover on these d(s)-branes, the full range of
running for u (0,), while for small r we are forced to stay at big values of
the holographic variable u .
it is well known that t-duality breaks supersymmetry in some cases [15],
our previous metrics are not exceptions to this phenomenon. note that we
are relating theories with 16 real supercharges, but we alredy showed that the
near horizon d3-brane shows enhancement of supersymmetry. the matching
condition for the number of supersymmetries is given by the fact that the com-
pact direction on the d3-brane (on both cases) eliminates the possibility of that
enhancement, while the other dp-branes dont show the enhancement at all.

it is important to notice that the supersymmetries which are broken by t-
duality correspond to those which get enhanced in the particular case of the
d3-brane, i.e. the bilinears associated with the broken killing spinors, are the
conformal killing vectors.

in our previous analysis we have consider the two dual pairs (d3/d4) and
(d2/d3). both star with the d3-brane with the only dierence that the com-
pactied dimension is or not on the transversal direction. let us study a bit
more carefully both pairs. in the (d3/d4) case the d4-metric is characterized by
two dierent moduli (g5, r). after the work in matrix theory [17], it is natural
to interpret g5 as related to the eleventh dimension of m-theory and therefore
to consider this metrics as coming from a compactication of m-theory on a
t 2, with sizes determined by the two moduli g5 and r. also it is well known
[18] that in the limit where the volume of the two torus goes to zero, we should
recover type iib theory. this mechanism implies the dynamical generation of
a quantum dimension with the corresponding kaluza-klein modes associated
with the menbrane wrapped on the two torus. when we apply this mechanism
to our case it is natural to expect to get in the limit of zero volume for the two
torus (v ol(t 2)  0) the type iib d3-brane metric of equation (95). using the
relations (96) and (102) we observe that the limit v ol(t 2)  0 corresponds to
a ten dimensional type iib theory, where the extra quantum dimension is the
s1 circle in the limit v  , with the radius given by (96). the up lifted of
the d4-brane to m-theory give us a m5-brane wrapped on a circle determined
by the value of g5. in addition to this, in our case we wrap the m5-brane on
another circle dening the two torus characterized by the two moduli (g5, r).
in the limit v ol(t 2)  0 what we get is the m5-brane wrapped on a two torus
of zero volume, that produce a d3-brane with the extra dimension dening the

transversional circle in the metric (95).

hence the theory on the d4-brane gets embedded in the six dimensional
(2, 0) theory on the m5-brane. as it is well known for the m5-brane we get
enhancement of supersymmetry and therefore we can say that the d4-brane
theory will ow to a conformal point in strong coupling. in other words what
we observed is that once we break the superconformal generators by t-duality
the resulting theory naturally ows to recover the supersymmetry by up lifting
to m-theory.

let us now consider the t-dual pair (d2/d3). this is very similar to the
previous case. in the d2-brane metric the moduli is characterized by (g3, v),
which again should by interpreted as m-theory compactied on a two torus of
size g3 and v. in the limit when the volume of the two torus goes to zero, we
should recover the type iib-picture by exactly the same mechanism described
above. the d2-brane is now up lifted to a m2-brane but contrary to what
happens in the (d3/d4) case, the extra quantum dimension becomes now
part of the world volume dimension of the t-dual d3-brane. more precisely
what we observed is that the compact world volume dimension in the metric
(106) is the extra quantum dimension in the type iib that we get when we
compactify m-theory on the two torus characterized by (g3, v). in other words
what we observed, is that the t-dual description in (106) of the uplifted d2-brane
is a three dimensional theory becoming four dimensional for strong coupling
v  0 in equation (111).
as before with the (d3/d4) pair we also observe here that the theories
ow to reach superconformal invariance. notice that this two dual saturate the
known examples of superconformal theories namely the d3-brane, m2-brane
and m5-brane. the (d3/d4) pair is related to the m5-brane and the (d2/d3)
pair to the m2-brane. the previous conjecture is in contrast to the mechanism
suggested in [19] for solving the cosmological constant problem.
in that we
can start with a three-dimensional theory that is expected to ow in strong
coupling to a four-dimensional theory. massive particles in three dimensions
are associated with conical geometries, when some amount of supersymmetry
is broken. the suggested solution to the cosmological constant problem, is
based on the assumption that these supersymmetries are not restore in the
strong coupling four-dimensional limit.
in our case, we have simply studied
supersymmetry generators associated with conformal transformations that are
the ones naturally broken by the action of t-duality, and we nd they are
restored in the up lifted m-theory limit.

the general picture emerging from the previous discussion is that once we
start with a superconformal theory, t-duality generally breaks the supersymme-
tries associated with the superconformal transformations, however the t-dual
theory tends to ow to recover these supersymmetries broken by t-duality up
lifting to m-theory.

to be more precise, starting with a d3-brane with the world volume com-
pactied on a circle of radius r, we break for nite radius the supersymmetries
associated with those killing spinors depending on world volume coordinates.
those are associated with the enhanced supersymmetry. in order to decide if

t-duality breaks or not supersymmetry, we perform a t-duality to a d2-brane.
once we have done that, we send the radius r to innite.
in this limit we
recover for the d3-brane the whole superconformal algebra, then if t-duality is
not braking supersymmetry we should nd that the t-dual of the r   limit
possesses enhanced superconformal invariance. in fact this is what happened.

supersymmetry induced by t-duality.
