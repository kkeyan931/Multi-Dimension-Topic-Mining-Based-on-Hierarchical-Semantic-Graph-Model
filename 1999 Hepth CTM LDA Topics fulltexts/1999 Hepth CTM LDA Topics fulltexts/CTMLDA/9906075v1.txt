abstract

in this thesis i present applications of the born-infeld action to the description of d-

branes, mostly in the context of type iib string theory. i briey review the relevant

aspects of the general formalism, including the eorts toward generalization of this

action to the non-abelian case. in the second chapter i present the construction of

a fundamental string attached to a threebrane, whereby the string is made out of the

wrapped brane. this interpretation withstands a rather detailed scrutiny, including the

magnitude of the static tension and of the b-i charge; and polchinskis mixed dirich-

let/neumann boundary conditions for small perturbations of the string. the latter

arise dynamically from the full non-linear equations of motion. also, the born-infeld

charge is shown to produce the correct form of dipole radiation under the inuence of

harmonic oscillations of the string.

the third chapter arises out of two papers on the application of these ideas to

the ads/cft correspondence. using the essentially non-perturbative nature of the

b-i action we were able to construct in the near-horizon geometry of n d3-branes the

color-singlet baryon vertex of the su(n) gauge theory as a vebrane wrapped on the

s5 sphere, with b-i strings playing the role of the quarks. also, in the asymptotically

at background we obtain a smooth classical description of the hanany-witten phe-

nomenon, whereby one drags a at vebrane across the stack of threebranes, and b-i

strings stretching between the two appear and disappear without any discontinuity.

in the case of non-extremal background we construct baryons of the three-dimensional

non-supersymmetric theory, the low energy dynamics of which was conjectured to be

equivalent to ordinary qcd. our approach allows to exhibit conning properties of

color ux tubes, i.e. the dependence of the tension of the ux tube on its color con-

tent. we do this by building an extended baryon, where a fraction  of the total of n

quarks is removed to a nite distance.

introduction and history

research into various aspects of d-branes in the past few years has become synony-

mous with the new string theory. beginning with the rst work by dai, leigh and

polchinski in 1989 [3], and the key discovery by polchinski [5] of the fact that d-

branes carry rr charges led to an incredible amount of activity surrounding branes.

d-branes, in particular the d2-brane and the ns5-brane are presently thought to be

the fundamental objects of m-theory, which is conjectured to incorporate all the known

species of string theory, plus the 11-dimensional supergravity. an important milestone

was the construction of the corresponding supergravity solutions by g. horowitz and

a. strominger [39]. this work itself built on the previous construction of the sugra

solution for an innite fundamental string by dabholkar and harvey [22].

the born-infeld action, sometimes also referred to as dirac-born-infeld action is the

eective action for low-energy degrees of freedom of the d-brane [4]. the consistency

of the -model for the world-sheet of the string is shown there to require that the

brane be described by bi action, just like in the general curved background requiring

consistency of string theory leads to the einstein-hilbert action. it should come as

no surprise then, that bi is also invariant under general coordinate transformations,

in fact it can be thougth as a theory with a more general metric, where the anti-

symmetric part of the metric tensor is identied with the electromagnetic eld. this

1

was the thinking of born and infeld [1] when they presented the nal version of their

modied electrodynamics. the original motivation was to get a better behaved theory,

one that would not have the coulomb self-energy divergence, etc... also one might

hope that the corresponding quantum eld theory might be better behaved too, but

progress is of course hindered by the fact that the action contains an innite number

of unrenormalisable interactions.

as explained above, the key dierence with previously known p-branes and super-

membranes [18, 20, 19] is the inclusion of a worldvolume electromagnetic eld. this

eld corresponds on the string theory side to virtual states of an open string, where

both ends are xed to move in the worldvolume of the brane.

the starting point for this thesis is the paper by callan and maldacena [6], hereafter

referred to as cm. they, noting that most treatments of d-branes were done using the

linearized theory, undertook to fully account for the specic non-linearities of the born-

infeld super-electrodynamics. the static features of intersecting branes are determined

by susy and bps arguments, however dynamical issues have to be explored using

the full born-infeld action. they construct, rst and foremost, the solution for a

fundamental string ending on a d-brane, in which the junction-point of the string

manifests itself as a point coulomb charge in the world-volume of the brane. they

also nd a non-bps solution corresponding to a brane and an anti-brane joined by e.g.

a fundamental string.

this thesis is based on a series of papers that arose directly out of the approach

callan and maldacena took in their paper. for the sake of convenience i list these

papers in the order in which they are presented in this thesis:

 neumann boundary conditions from born-infeld dynamics,

 brane death via born-infeld string, by k. savvidy, hep-th/9810163

 baryons and string creation from the fivebrane worldvolume action,

 baryons and flux tubes in conning gauge theories from brane actions,

by c.g. callan, a. guijosa, k. g. savvidy, o. tafjord, hep-th/9902197

i have used the texts of these papers to large extent verbatim, especially in the case of

the latter two papers, in this thesis.

in chapter 1 i review some general facts about the born-infeld action. in particular,

section 1.1 deals with the two possible representations of the action, the manifestly

generally covariant one, and the dimensionally reduced version which is necessarily in

the static gauge. section 1.2 discusses briey the subject that hasnt received full

development as yet, that of non-abelian generalization of the b-i action.

in chapter 2 i present some applications of ideas from cm to threebrane physics.

specically, sections 2.2 and 2.3 show how polchinskis open string boundary condi-

tions arise dynamically from the b-i treatment of the f-string attached to a d3-brane.

in cm it was shown that excitations which are normal to both the string and the 3-

brane behave as if they had dirichlet boundary conditions at the point of attachement.

we show that certain excitations of the f-string/d3-brane system can be shown to

obey neumann boundary conditions by considering the born-infeld dynamics of the

f-string (viewed as a 3-brane cylindrically wrapped on an s2). in cm it was shown

that excitations which are normal to both the string and the 3-brane behave as if they

had dirichlet boundary conditions at the point of attachment. in [8] we show that exci-

tations which are coming down the string with a polarization along a direction parallel

to the brane are almost completely reected just as in the case of all-normal excita-

tions, but the end of the string moves freely on the 3-brane, thus realizing polchinskis

open string neumann boundary condition dynamically. in the low energy limit   0,
for wavelengths much larger than the string scale only a small fraction  4 of
i.e.

3

the energy escapes in the form of dipole radiation. the physical interpretation is that

a string attached to the 3-brane manifests itself as an electric charge, and waves on

the string cause the end point of the string to freely oscillate and therefore produce

electromagnetic dipole radiation in the asymptotic outer region.

section 2.4 contains the calculation of the brane-anti-brane potential, which can be

used to capture some new features of the quasi-classical tunneling of the brane-anti-

brane pair joined by an f-string. this is of relevance to a subject that has since at-

tracted certain attention, the brane-anti-brane annihilation: see e.g. a. sen, tachyon

condensation.. and e. witten d-branes and k-theory. our calculation shows that

for a distance between the branes that is larger than some critical distance, deter-

mined by the string coupling, the stretched string is indeed quasi-stable, while for

shorter distances it is tachyonic.

the attraction between the branes causes them to approach and at some point to

tunnel, because the action of the bounce solution goes to zero. the energy of the
solution at the top of the barrier, the sphaleron, goes like  d3 for large separations
d, while the energy of the string is proportional to its length d.

chapter 3 has a slightly dierent avor. there, the b-i action is used to describe a

vebrane placed in the supergravity background of n coincident d3-branes. in the near-

horizon limit, according to witten, the background ve-form rr eld induces n units of

electric charge on the vebrane, which should be interpreted as n fundamental strings

attached to it. these strings play the role of quarks in the ads/cft correspondence,

and the conguration as a whole is interpreted as a color neutral baryon of su(n)

super-ym theory.

in essence, b-i is known to incorporate corrections to string theory to all orders in

, and thus allows us to construct an essentially non-perturbative object on the gauge

theory side: the baryon. in addition, this approach is self consistent, since b-i action

is only valid for slowly varying elds (the action does not contain derivative-dependent

4

corrections to the eective string action). our solutions have elds that are everywhere

smooth thus ensuring the consistency of our description.

the extension of these to the full d3 metric results in a nice classical description

of the hanany-witten phenomenon, whereby strings are created when a at d5-brane

is pulled through the threebrane stack. a surprising byproduct is the conguration

where n/2 strings are stretched to the threebranes on either side, and change their

orientation when one crosses the threebrane. thus the total change in the number

of strings is n, as expected. this conguration1, is characterized by zero force on

the 5-brane, as the attraction due to the tension of the string is exactly balanced by

electrostatic repulsion. these considerations seem to suggest the actual existence of

the 1/2 string state, the proper interpretation of which is at present not clear.

in the section 3.3 we use near-horizon geometry of non-extremal d3-branes to nd

embeddings of a d5-brane which describe baryonic states in three-dimensional qcd.

in particular, we construct solutions corresponding to a baryon made of n quarks,

and study what happens when some fraction  of the total number of quarks are

bodily moved to a large spatial separation from the others. the individual clumps of

quarks are represented by born-infeld string tubes obtained from a d5-brane whose
spatial section has topology r  s4. they are connected by a conning color ux
tube, described by a portion of the vebrane that runs very close and parallel to the

horizon. we nd that this ux tube has a tension with a nontrivial -dependence (not

previously obtained by other methods). we also discuss related questions including

binding energies, string creation, and the appearance of new energy scales.

1.1 general covariance of the born-infeld action

this section closely follows [33] by m. aganagic, c. popescu and j.h. schwarz and [7]

by g.w. gibbons in the treatment of general covariance of the born-infeld action. born

1it was found for the case of 0-brane in [50].

5

and infeld [1] realized the nal version of their non-linear electrodynamics through a

manifestly covariant action. in modern language this can be expressed by saying that

the world-volume theory of the brane is described by the action

s(p) = 

1

(2)pgs z dp+1qdet(g + f)

(1.1)

where f is the world-volume electromagnetic eld strength, measured in units in which

2 = 1. g is the induced metric on the brane

g = mnx mx n.

(1.2)

the action is invariant under arbitrary dieomorphysms of the world-volume. one

way of xing this freedom is to adopt the so-called static gauge for which the world-

volume coordinates are equated with the rst p + 1 space-time coordinates:

x   ,  = 0, 1, .., p .

(1.3)

this static gauge description is most convenient if the brane is indeed positioned

along those directions.

the rest of the coordinates become world-volume elds

x m  m, m = p + 1, .., 9 .

the b-i action becomes

s(p) = 

1

(2)pgs z dp+1q det( + ii + f) .

(1.4)

(1.5)

note that this is in some sense a modication of pure b-i: it has extra scalar elds .

another way of obtaining the same is to dimensionally reduce from 10d at-space

b-i by assuming that elds depend only on the rst p + 1 coordinates , where p is

the number of space dimensions of the brane. in this picture the extra components

of the gauge eld , ap+1...a9 come to represent the massless transverse excitations

6

p+1...9. in fact, they are the goldstone bosons associated with spontaneously broken
translational symmetries. in this way one gets to compute a 1010 determinant instead
of a 4  4 determinant. the general coordinate invariance is not apparent in this
approach, and in fact it is hard or impossible to use if a more general parametrization

of the brane is desired, or the brane is immersed into an already curved background.

a simple illustration of the equivalence of this two forms of the action is to consider an

elecrostatic case, with only one scalar eld excited. the corresponding determinants

it is easy to see that the two are equivalent by simple row and column subtractions.

the discussion so far, and in most applications, concerns the bosonic action.

however it is important to remember that it is a susy theory that we are dealing

with. some non-trivial issues are presented in the paper [33] by aganagic, popescu and

schwarz. in the rst, manifestly general-covariant representation, the supersymmetric

theory consists of x m , the at 10-dimensional space coordinates; the u(1) gauge eld

a on the world-volume; and a pair of majorana-weyl spinors 1 and 2. these spinors

are of the same or opposite chirality depending on whether we consider type iia or

iib theory (even/odd p). the resulting theory possesses a high degree of symmetry:

 global super-poincare group in 10d

 local general coordinate invariance

 local fermionic kappa symmetry
2we specialize to the case of three-brane here.

7

 local u(1) gauge invariance
in the gauge-xed version the action is quite simple, and versions for dierent ps

can be obtained from a single 10d action by dimensional reduction:

z d10rdet (cid:16) + f  2 +   (cid:17).

(1.7)

here  is the one surviving majorana-weyl spinor, with the second one having been

set to zero. the number of physical degrees of freedom is 8 for the gauge eld, and for

the fermions the 32 original components are reduced in half by local kappa symmetry

and again in half by the equations of motion.

among the symmetries of the gauge-invariant action are the global translations

x m = am. decomposing these into translations a tangent to the brane and ai normal

to the brane, we have

x  = a + x  = a +  = 0 ,
i = ai + i
= ai  ai .

(1.8)

in these equations a compensating general coordinate transformation is used, with a
parameter  = a, in order to preserve the x  =  gauge. one can also infer the
induced transformation of the gauge eld a :

a = af = aa + aa

(1.9)

this broke down into two pieces: rst, the translation proper; second, a gauge trans-

formation with parameter , such that  = aa.

in order to clarify the meaning of these formulas it is useful to specialize to the cases

of completely normal and completely tangent translations. for small translations ai,

 = 0 and thus:

x  = 0 , i = ai , and a = 0 .

(1.10)

this is just a trivial shift, but nonetheless a signicant symmetry of the theory: it corre-

sponds to spontaneously broken (by the presence of the brane) translational symmetry

normal to the brane, and i are the associated goldstone bosons.

8

the second case, in this context, is the unbroken tangent translations a. the

formulas read:

x  = 0 ,

thus  = a .

the dynamical elds transform as

i = ai ,
a = aa + aa .

(1.11)

(1.12)

we will use an ansatz inspired by these formulas to describe tangent uctuations of the

f-string/d-brane conguration in section 2.3. in that case the translation parameter

a is no longer constant, but is position dependent. in fact, it should be clear from the

form of the previous expressions that a is presumed small. nevertheless the idea of a

compensating general coordinate transformation remains useful to make sure that the

elds, i.e.  and a represent the desired bending of the surface of the brane.

for completeness we also quote the susy transformations of the supersymmetric

version of b-i theory

 = 1 + 2 (p) + 



i = (1  2 (p))i + i
a = (2 (p)  1)( + ii)

+(

1
3

1  2 (p))mm + a  a ,

(1.13)

where , as explained above, is the parameter of a compensating general coordinate
transformation that restores the static gauge, i.e.  2 = 0 and x  = 0 under these

transformations. from these requirements it follows that

 = (2 (p)  1).

(1.14)

here and above  (p) represents a matrix, exact form of which can be found in [33],

suce it to say that key property of it is  (p)  (p) =  (p) (p) = 1.

9

1.2 non-abelian generalizations of b-i

the eorts to nd a generalisation of b-i action to the non-abelian case are motivated

by the need to eectively describe n coincident branes, where the u(1)n symmtery is

enhanced to u(n) = su(n)u(1). this can be understood as the eect of the massive
vector bosons (open strings connecting the dierent branes) becoming light/massless

as the branes are moved closer.

the earliest proposals entail formally expanding the ordinary b-i lagrangian in

powers of f , then taking a simple [23], an anti-symmetrized [24], or a symmetrized

[25] trace over the group indices. this is necessary because if the determinant is

understood to be taken over the lorentz indices, then the only way to deal with the

color index is to expand the expression under the square root, and only then deal with

the color index. below we present a recent proposal [36] to compute the determinant

with respect to combined lorentz and color indices.

the matters are further complicated by the diculty to disentangle the derivative

terms f which arise in the perturbative expansion from the commutator terms, as

can be seen from the following identity for a commutator of covariant derivatives:

[dm, dn]fkl = [fmn, fkl] .

(1.15)

tseytlin proposed to resolve this by treating all terms that can be written as a com-

mutator to be part of the derivative dependent part of the eective action. in this

way the f 3 terms in the open bosonic string eective action can be dropped, and the

f 4 terms dier with the superstring case by only a commutator term also. in fact,

these terms can be written as

tr(cid:18)4

3

ifmn[fml, fnl](cid:19) + 22tr(cid:16)f mnf rl[fmn, frl](cid:17)

(1.16)

and thus belong according to his denition to the covariant derivative part of lef f .

tseytlin then proceeds to give a general argument for taking the symmetrized trace in

10

the formal expansion of the abelian b-i action. he gets, to quadratic order

ln bi = strqdet(mn + fmn) = str(cid:20)f 2

in the paper by w. taylor iv and a. hashimoto [37] this functional was checked

against e.g. the excitation spectrum of open strings on branes intersecting at an angle.

they show that this action can be used to resolve some but not all of the discrepancies.

a more recent proposal by j. park [36] is in some sense very natural, similar ideas

were circulating in early 97 , i.e. to combine the spacetime and the group indices into

one and then compute a single determinant. this is in fact typical of ym eective

actions: see for example the original computation of the pure ym eective action by

g. savvidy [27]. there too it is computed by exponentiating the matrix in order to

trade the determinant for a trace (see below). f and g become matrices with a double

index as follows:

and

f,   f a

t a


g  g,   g .

(1.17)

(1.18)

after dening a convenient subsidiary matrix f  g1f , park proposes the fol-

lowing non-abelian generalization of the born-infeld lagrangian

l = 2n2(cid:16)(det(g + f ))
= 2n2q|g|(cid:16)exp(cid:16)pn=1

where  = 2 is a coupling constant. the 2n-th order root is inserted in order to

insure that for large f the action is bounded from above by a xed power of f , equal
to p + 1 and independent of n. the second, related reason is that det|g| = |g|n.

further in the same paper an instanton solution is constructed through a combi-

nation of the usual ansatz with some numerical integration. the total action of this

solution seems to have the correct value 82.

in conclusion we would like to mention that despite certain progress, the issues

surrounding the nonabelian generalisation of the b-i action are still unclear, and in

any case actual applications to brane physics are lacking. however we will be able to

sidestep the ambiguities pointed out above when we consider in chapter 3 a vebrane

in the essentially non-abelian background of n d3-branes. there the dynamics of the

vebrane is captured by the usual abelian worldvolume gauge eld, which it might be

possible to interpret as the a  la thooft abelian projection of the su(n) elds.

chapter 2

applications of b-i action to the
3-brane

2.1 electrostatics on the threebrane

the starting point for this thesis is the paper by callan and maldacena [6], hereafter

referred to as cm. they, noting that most treatments of d-branes were done using the

linearized theory, undertook to fully account for the specic non-linearities of the born-

infeld super-electrodynamics. the static features of intersecting branes are determined

by susy and bps arguments, however dynamical issues have to be explored using

the full born-infeld action. they construct, rst and foremost, the solution for a

fundamental string ending on a d-brane, in which the end-point of a string manifests

itself as a point coulomb charge in the world-volume of the brane. they also nd a non-

bps solution correspoding to a brane and an anti-brane joined by e.g. a fundamental

string.

we repeat their arguments for the construction. starting from a 10-dimensional b-i

action and dimensionally reducing to 3+1 dimensions we need to compute the action

s = 

1

gp z d4xq det(g + f)

, with gp = (2)3gs

this expression was computed by myself in june 1997, and a slightly less general

version can be found in the review by gibbons [7]. in cm supersymmetry analysis is

used to nd the required solution. this is possible because for supersymmetric bps

congurations the value of the b-i action coincides with the linear theory. thus one can

nd the required solution by constructing one for the linear theory and then checking

that it satisfy the equations of motion of the full non-linear theory.

this is done in more detail in section 2.4 for the more general, non-bps static

conguration that corresponds to a threebrane and anti-brane joined by a fundamental

string. the limit of a single brane with an innite string attached is simply the limit of

innite separation between the branes, or a  b whereby a and b are the integration
constants for the electric and scalar elds respectively.

in order to use bps arguments to nd solutions of the three-brane worldvolume

gauge theory which have the interpretation of string ending on a three-brane, we, after

cm, consider the supersymmetry variation of the gaugino

 = mnfmn

(2.3)

where mn are ten-dimensional indices. this is the dimensional reduction decription,

so that the coordinate and electromagnetic massless excitations are both part of the

same ten-dimensional electromagnetic eld strength fmn as is the case in the above

matrix (2.2).

14

we would like to nd a solution to (2.3) for which  = 0 for some . this is not

possible for a point charge coulomb gauge eld alone. however we can also excite one

of the transverse scalar elds such that  = a0 = c

r . this is clearly a solution of the

linearized (laplace) equation. taking into account that f0r = f09, the supersymmetry

variation (2.3) reduces to

(0r + 9r) = 0  (0 + 9) = 0  (1 + 09) = 0 .

(2.4)

therefore a susy spinor, polarized along the directions of the worldsheet (09) preserves

half the supersymmetry. this is the same spinor as in dabholkar and harvey, even

though here the situation is complicated by the simultaneous presence of the threebrane

and the fact that the string is half-innite. in section 3.1.2 we present a more complete

explanation of the conditions imposed on susy variations in the presence of various

branes.

in the context of type iib sugra there is a further condition due to the

presence of the threebrane, which can be written as

0123 = i .

(2.5)

one can nd the charge quantization condition in cm, and determine the value of c

in the solution as c = g. thus the solution nally is

 =

c
r

,

a0 =

c

~e =

r2 ~er .

(2.6)

further, cm show that this innite spike should be interpreted as an innite funda-

mental string. first, one can derive the hamiltonian for the static congurations that

we have been so far considering

h =

1

gpq(1 + (gp~)2)(1 + (~x)2)  (gp~  ~x)2 .

(2.7)

using this expression, one can conrm that the energy per unit length of the string-

like object is indeed equal to that of a fundamental string de = 1

2 d or t = 1
2 .

15

in the next two sections it is shown that this picture survives a more detailed

scrutiny, by considering the dynamical behavior of this conguration under small per-

turbations. polchinskis open string boundary conditions (dirichlet or neumann) arise

from the full born-infeld theory dynamically.

2.2 dynamics: dirichlet boundary conditions

having presented the static b-i charge conguration, we go on to show that small

excitations which propagate along the string, in the low-energy limit completely reect

with

 dirichlet boundary conditions for excitations completely orthogonal to both the

brane and the string, (this section)1

 neumann boundary conditions for normal excitations of the string that are po-

larized along one of the directions of the brane. (next section 2.3)

in order to consider the rst case we need to add another scalar eld into considera-

tion. the convenient form of b-i is the dimensional reduction from 10d. the relevant

determinant is

computing this and substituting the background values of the elds gives the following

action for the dynamics of the  eld:

worldsheet action in the supergravity background of the threebrane.

(2.10)

(2.11)

in order to fully verify the correspondence with polchinkis picture of d-brane

dynamics via open fundamental strings, we have to look into the eective boundary

condition for small uctuations on the string (the r  0 region) imposed by the
presence of the three-brane (the r   region). in other words, we want the s-matrix
connecting the two asymptotic regions.

we would like to look for solutions of denite energy (frequency). with the conve-

nient redenition of radius and coupling, the equation becomes

 1 +

2

x4!  + x2 d

dx  x2 d

dx

! = 0

with x = r , and  = c2 .

(2.12)

at this point the problem gets a unied dependence on energy and coupling through
the parameter  = c2 = gs2. the equation has the interesting symmetry r  /r
with     r. this seems to imply that the interior asymptotic region, i.e. the string,
is completely equivalent, or dual, to the outer region, i.e. the brane. notice also the

1 + 1

r4 factor, familiar from the sugra solution for the 3-brane. see also [34] for rst

hints of distance/radius duality in ads. in order to treat the two asymptotic regions

on an equal footing and to elucidate the fact that excitations slow down as r  0
it turns out to be convenient to introduce a new radial coordinate which measures the

distance along the surface of the spike

(2.14)

the coordinate behaves as   r in the outer region (r  ) and   /r on the
string (r  0). the exact symmetry of the equation r  /r goes over to   .
the equation, when written in this coordinate becomes just the free wave equation,

these formulae give us the asymptotic wave function in the regions   , while
around  = 0 (x = ) there is a symmetric repulsive potential which drops very fast
 1/6 on either side of the origin. the scattering is described by a single dimensionless
parameter  = c2, and in the limit of small frequency  and/or coupling c = gs the

potential becomes narrow and high, and can be replaced by a -function with an

equivalent area under the curve:

(2.16)

(2.17)

therefore the scattering matrix becomes almost independent of the exact form of the

potential. we are interested in the behavior of the one-dimensional reection and

transmission amplitudes r and t . the result is that most of the amplitude is reected

back with a phase shift close to , thus dynamically realizing the dirichlet boundary

condition in the low energy limit:

  0
r  1  2i/.77
t  2i/.77

  
r  0
|t|  1

(2.18)

we also learn from this that there is a smooth crossover from perfectly reecting to

perfectly transparent behavior as a function of the energy. moreover wkb arguments

show that the phase shift of the transmitted wave does not tend to zero, but to a

constant of order unity.

however a more detailed analysis shows that -function approximation is not ex-

actly correct, even in the limit of small . a better approximation is that of a square

potential, which can be adjusted with two parameters to match both the integral of

the potential and the integral of the square root of the potential, a quantity familiar

from wkb underbarrier tunneling. the integral of the square root of the potential is

note that this coincides with (2.18) for s  0. it also incorporates the correct ex-
ponential fallo in the wavefunction. as calculated above, our specic potential has

19

s  1.75. thus the scaling of the amplitudes with  is not essentially modied in this
more detailed calculation, but only the exact coecient is aected:

r  1  i0.92
t   i0.92

(2.21)

with this we conclude the analysis of completely transverse excitations of the string/brane

system, and proceed in the next section to the considerably more complicated longitu-

dinal excitations. as we will argue in that case, there are reasons to believe that the

coecient computed above should in fact be exactly equal to one.

2.3 dynamics: neumann boundary conditions

we would like to show that certain excitations of the f-string/d3-brane system obey

neumann (free) boundary conditions by considering the born-infeld dynamics of the

f-string (viewed as a 3-brane cylindrically wrapped on an s2). in the paper by callan

and maldacena it was shown that excitations which are normal to both the string

and the 3-brane behave as if they had dirichlet boundary conditions at the point of

attachment. here we show that excitations which are coming down the string with

a polarization along a direction parallel to the brane are almost completely reected

just as in the case of all-normal excitations, but the end of the string moves freely

on the 3-brane, thus realizing polchinskis open string neumann boundary condition

dynamically. in the low energy limit   0, i.e.
for wavelengths much larger than
the string scale only a small fraction  4 of the energy escapes in the form of dipole
radiation. the physical interpretation is that a string attached to the 3-brane manifests

itself as an electric charge, and waves on the string cause the end point of the string

to freely oscillate and therefore produce e.m. dipole radiation in the asymptotic outer

region.

20

dai, leigh and polchinski [3] introduced d-branes as objects on which strings can

end, and required that the string have dirichlet (xed) boundary conditions for coor-

dinates normal to the brane, and neumann (free) boundary conditions for coordinate

directions parallel to the brane [5, 3, 4]. it was shown in [6] (see previous section 2.2)

that small uctuations which are normal to both the string and the brane are mostly

reected back with a phase shif t   which indeed corresponds to dirichlet boundary
condition. see also [34] and [28] for a treatment of this problem, that relies on nambu-

goto (or covariant) action for the worldsheet of the string placed in the supergravity

background of the threebrane.

in this section we will show that p-wave excitations which are coming down the

string with a polarization along a direction parallel to the brane are almost completely

reected just as in the case of all-normal excitations, but the end of the string moves

freely on the 3-brane, thus realizing polchinskis open string neumann boundary con-

dition dynamically. as we will see a superposition of excitations of the scalar x9 and

of the e.m. eld reproduces the required behaviour, e.g. reection of the geometrical
uctuation with a phase shif t  0 (neumann boundary condition)2.

in addition we observe e.m. dipole radiation which escapes to innity from the

place where the string is attached to the 3-brane. we shall see that in the low energy

limit   0, i.e.
for wavelengths much larger than the string scale a small fraction
 4 of the energy escapes to innity in the form of e.m. dipole radiation. the physical
interpretation is that a string attached to the 3-brane manifests itself as an electric

charge, and waves on the string cause the end point of the string to freely oscillate and

therefore produce e.m. dipole radiation in the asymptotic outer region of the 3-brane.

thus not only in the static case, but also in a more general dynamical situation the

2this problem was also considered in [28] where the e.m. eld is integrated out to produce an
eective lagrangian for the scalar eld only. the other essential dierence with us is that we consider
p -wave modes of the scalar eld which describe physical transverse uctuations of the f-string and
not the s-wave modes which do not correspond to physical excitations of the string.

21

above interpretation remains valid. this result provides additional support to the idea

that the electron may be understood as the end of a fundamental string ending on a

d-brane.

2.3.1 the lagrangian and the equations

let us write out the full lagrangian (see section which contains both electric and

magnetic elds, plus the scalar x9  

l = z d4xdet ,
where det = 1 + ~b2  ~e2 (cid:16) ~e  ~b(cid:17)2

+(cid:16) ~b  ~(cid:17)2

(cid:16) ~e  ~(cid:17)2

 (0)2(1 + ~b2) + (~)2
+ 20(cid:16) ~b  [~  ~e](cid:17)

(2.22)

we will proceed by adding a uctuation to the background values (2.6) :

~e = ~e0 +  ~e, ~b =  ~b,  = 0 +  .

then keeping only terms in the det which are linear and quadratic in the uctuation

we will get

+(cid:16) ~b~(cid:17)2

(cid:16) ~e0  ~(cid:17)2

det =  ~b2   ~e2  ( ~e0 ~b)2  (0)2 + (~)2
 2(cid:16) ~e0  ~(cid:17)(cid:16) ~e  ~(cid:17)
2(cid:16) ~e0 ~e(cid:17) + 2(cid:16)~~(cid:17)

(cid:16) ~e  ~(cid:17)2

(2.23)

note that one should keep the last two linear terms because they produce additional

quadratic terms after taking the square root. these terms involve the longitudinal

polarization of the e.m. eld and cancel out at quadratic order. the resulting quadratic

lagrangian is

2lq =  ~e2(cid:16)1 + (~)2(cid:17)   ~b2 + (0)2  (~)2(cid:18)1  ~e0

2(cid:19) + ~e0

2(cid:16)~   ~e(cid:17) .

(2.24)

22

let us introduce the gauge potential for the uctuation part of the e.m. eld as (a0, ~a)

and substitute the values of the background elds from (2.6)

2lq = (cid:16)0 ~a  ~a0(cid:17)2(cid:18)1 +

1

r4(cid:19)(cid:16) ~  ~a(cid:17)2

r4(cid:19)+

1

r4 (cid:16)0 ~a  ~a0(cid:17)~ .

(2.25)

the equations that follow from this lagrangian contain dynamical equations for the

vector potential and for the scalar eld, and a separate equation which represents a
constraint. these equations in the lorenz gauge ~ ~a = 0a0 are

(2.26)

(2.27)

(2.28)

equation (2.27) is a constraint: the time derivative of the lhs is zero, as can be shown

using the equation of motion (2.26).

let us choose a0 = . this condition can be viewed as (an attempt to) preserve
the bps relation which holds for the background: ~e = ~. another point of view is

that this xes the general coordinate invariance which is inherent in the born-infeld

lagrangian in such a way as to make the given perturbation to be normal to the surface.

of course transversality is insured automatically but this choice makes it explicit. the

general treatment of this subject can be found in [33]. see also section 1.1 for a quick

review of the issues involved.

with this condition the equations (2.27) and (2.28) become the same, and the rst

equation is also simplied:

1

0

~a(cid:18)1 +
2
0  +  + ~
2

r4(cid:19) +  ~a = 0 ,
1
r4 0 ~a = 0 .

(2.29)

(2.30)

this should be understood to imply that once we obtain a solution, a0 is determined

23

from , but in addition we are now obliged to respect the gauge condition which goes
over to ~ ~a = 0.
2.3.2 neumann boundary conditions and dipole radiation

we will seek a solution with denite energy (frequency w) in the following form: ~a

should have only one component az, and  be an l = 1 spherical p -wave

az = (r) eit

,

 =

z
r

(r) eit

the geometrical meaning of such a choice for  is explained in fig 2.1, and the particular

choice of z dependence corresponds to the polarization of the oscillations along the z

direction of the brane. with this ansatz the equations become

(cid:18)1 +

(2.31)

(2.32)

with the gauge condition becoming r = i. it can be seen again, that the second

equation follows from the rst by dierentiation. this is because the former coincides

with the constraint in our ansatz.

therefore the problem is reduced to nding the solution of a single scalar equation,

and determining the other elds through subsidiary conditions. the equation 2.31

itself surprisingly turned out to be the one familiar from cm [6] for the transverse

uctuations. we refer the reader to section 2.2 for a detailed discussion of asymptotic

wavefunctions and scattering amplitudes.

the asymptotic wave functions can be constructed as plane waves in the coordinate

, as introduced in section 2.2,

or in the various limits:

these formulae give us the asymptotic wave function in the regions   , while
around  = 0 (r = 1) there is a symmetric repulsive potential which drops very fast
 1/6 on either side of the origin. the scattering is described by a single dimensionless
parameter c, and in the limit of small  and/or coupling c = gs the potential
becomes narrow and high, and can be replaced by a -function with an equivalent area
 1
gs under the curve. therefore the scattering matrix becomes almost independent
of the exact form of the potential. the end result is that most of the amplitude is

reected back with a phase shift close to , thus dynamically realizing the dirichlet

boundary condition in the low energy limit.

in order to obtain  (and ) we need to dierentiate  with respect to r:

i = 1

(1 + r4)5/4 ei(r)

(1 + r4)1/4 (cid:18)1 +

(2.33)

again it is easy to obtain the simplied limiting form:

i  (cid:18)r3 
r  0
r   i  (cid:18)1
r2 

i

r2(cid:19) ei(r)
r (cid:19) ei(r)

i

this brings about several consequences for . firstly, it causes  to grow as  1/r2 as
r  0. this is the correct behaviour because when converted to displacement in the z
direction, it means constant amplitude:

 =

z
r

 = 1
r

=

z
r

1
r2 z  z  const .

(2.34)

secondly, the i that enters causes the superposition of the incoming and reected waves

to become a cosine from a sine, as is the case for  waves. this corresponds to a 0

phase shift and implies neumann boundary condition for the  wave (figure 2.2).

because of the  factor in the gauge condition we need to be careful about nor-

malizations, thus we shall choose to x the amplitude of the z (or ) wave to be

26

independent of . then the magnitude of the e.m. eld in the inner region becomes
independent of  as well. combined with the transmission factor, proportional to c,
this gives the following form of the dipole radiation eld at innity3

gs

r

az 

0eit =

eit =

(2.35)

in order to make a comparison with thomson formula i = 4

34e2a2 for the total power
emitted by an oscillating dipole, we note that the agreement is guaranteed if the exact

coecient in (2.35) is equal to one. as shown at the end of the previous section, our

approximate computation of the transmission amplitude gives this coecient as  .92.
thus it is plausible that the magnitude of emitted power is in fact exactly equal to the

elementary expectation from ordinary electrodynamics.

in conclusion, we need to analyze the outgoing scalar wave. this wave has both

real and imaginary parts, the former is from dierentiating the phase, while the latter
is from the prefactor. the imaginary part is  1/r2 which drops faster than radiation.
the real part does contribute to the radiation at spatial innity, as can be shown

from the integral of the energy density r (r)2d3r  r 4/r2  4r2dr  4. this is

not altogether surprising, as we are dealing with a supersymmetric theory where the

dierent elds are tied together. thus the observer at spatial innity will see both an

electromagnetic dipole radiation eld and a scalar wave. interestingly, the direction

dependences of the two conspire to produce a spherically symmetric distribution of the

energy radiated.

the problem of longitudinal uctuations was treated in [28], though not in a com-

pletely satisfactory way. there the scalar eld was taken to be an s-wave, which as

should be apparent from fig 2.1b, does not correspond to the string oscillating as a

whole. in addition the electromagnetic eld was eectively integrated out, thus one

cannot obtain the dipole radiation at spatial innity.

3the unit of electric charge in our notation is gs = e2. this is because of the scaling of the elds

needed to get the u(1) action with 1/e2 in front of it.

2.4 brane-anti-brane annihilation

we revisit the solution of born-infeld theory which corresponds to a d3-brane and

anti-brane joined by a (fundamental) string. the global instability of this congura-

tion makes possible the semiclassical tunneling into a wide, short tube which keeps

expanding out, thus annihilating the brane. this tunneling is suppressed exponen-
tially as exp{ scl
g }, where scl would be the action of the euclidean bounce solution,
the construct that describes under-barrier tunneling in the wkb approximation. the

attraction between the branes causes them to approach and annihilate at a nite dis-

tance dmin, where the potential barrier disappears. for large separations d, the energy
of the solution at the top of the barrier, the sphaleron, goes like  d3 , while the energy
of the string is proportional to its length d.

callan and maldacena [6] considered among other congurations the d3-brane and

anti-brane joined by a (fundamental) string in the framework of born-infeld theory.

the string is made of a d3-brane, wrapped aroung s2 sphere. when looked from some

distance, such an object does not appear to carry rr charge as a whole,but is rather

like a rr dipole, and has energy per unit length proper to the fundamental string.

such a conguration is only quasi-stable, since globally it is possible to lose energy

by making the throat very wide: if it had radius r, the change in energy is mostly due
to tension4 and goes like  r2  d  r3 and is arbitrarily negative. however, there is
a potential energy barrier and one needs to construct the bouncing euclidean solution

in order to address the problem in a complete way. in cm [6] it was attempted to

approach the problem by dropping the contributions due to the electric eld, in that

case the lagrangian is lorentz invariant with respect to r,t and it is possible to construct

some approximation to the bouncing solution.

4the second term has the same origin as in [31]. the two branes act as a sort of capacitor to create
a uniform bulk 3-form rr eld to which the cylindrically wrapped brane couples. the only dierence
is dimensionality: in case of the 2-brane the potential goes as r2, and for the 3-brane its  r3.

29

in this section we will compute exactly the energy of the string and sphaleron

solution (the unstable static solution at the top of the potential barrier). this will

allow to conclude that the tunneling rate in fact goes to innity when the branes

approach each other but still are at a nite distance  lsgs.
2.4.1 the two static congurations

we will review the construction of the relevant solution from cm [6]. similar solutions

were also considered by gibbons in [7].

consider the case when the worldbrane gauge eld is purely electric and only one

transverse coordinate x is excited. the worldbrane action reduces to

one can view this solution as a way to minimally break supersymmetry, instead of

in units of g. we will be interested in b > a, in this case the resulting conguration

will be the 3-brane and anti-brane joined by a smooth throat. to see this, one needs

to explicitly exploit the geometry by nding x:

here r4

0 = b2  a2. we have set x() = 0, e.g. far away the brane is at and is at
zero coordinate in the transverse direction. x(r0) is nite, but x(r0) is innite: the

throat becomes vertical at that radius. this can be continued back out through r0 to

give the two branes. branes possess orientation and continuing it through the throat

we see that the new brane is of the opposite orientation: an antibrane.

also show, by using the functional properties of the gamma function, that 3u = v.

also, constant c from (2.42) is also related, in fact c = v. the energies of the string

and the sphaleron become, respectively

estring = u(3 + 3)

esph = u(3 + 31) .

note, that we have now taken the larger of the two roots to be , the other root being

1/. one can even write a relation between the energies of the string and sphaleron

solutions estring(1/) = esph(). even though this relation is formal, (each function is

dened only for arguments larger than one) it might be of signicance in the future.

the energy of a long string after fully substituting the dimensionful units becomes

this reproduces the correct tension of the fundamental string. the slope of the energy

function is zero at the minimum possible value of  = 1 (fig 2.3).

one further interesting elaboration is possible. the energy surface in the parameter

space of r0 and d (or , ) apparently has a kink well known from catastrophe theory.

33

the point at which the kink rst appears corresponds to 2 = 2 and  = 1. for

2 < 2 the energy is monotonous in , and there is no static solutions, otherwise it

has one minimum and one maximum, corresponding to the string and the sphaleron

respectively.

2.4.2 annihilation by tunneling.

let us recall that two branes, a 3-brane and an anti-brane, are going to gravitationally

attract, even though weakly, causing them to move closer and to eventually annihilate.

the tunneling through the potential barrier, the sphaleron being the unstable solution

at the top, will be exponentially weak [6], but as the branes move closer  and 

become smaller. this makes the tunneling easier in a twofold way: by making the

barrier both narrower (distance between  and 1/ becomes smaller), and shallower,

with the energy at the top decreasing to become equal to the energy of the string. as

  1, the rate of tunneling rate increases indenitely, and at  = 1 the metastable
string state ceases to exist. this is an interesting example of physical continuity: before

the state disappeared as we change the parameter (d or ), its physical width due to

tunneling had to become innite.

unfortunately, even though these conclusions are self consistent, they may still be

physically incomplete due to the fact that as branes approach to planckian distance

new nonperturbative phenomena of annihilation may kick in. one possible way out of

this diculty is to crank up the string coupling, this leads into unknown territory too

but our quasi-classical tunneling may indeed be the dominant mode of annihilation in

that regime.

born-infeld action and ads/cft
correspondence

in this chapter we will construct solutions of the born-infeld action for a d5-brane

in the background of a stack of n d3-branes. the original paper [30] is by c.g.

callan, a.guijosa and myself, and i have freely used the text of that paper here. by

building on some recent work of imamura [54], we can nd bps-saturated solutions

which presumably correspond to exact solutions of string theory. using the general

approach of [6, 7], these solutions use d5-branes wrapped in various ways to describe

branes and strings attached to each other. the primary object we construct this way is

a d5-brane joined to n d3-branes by a bundle of fundamental strings. our solutions

give a detailed description of the creation of these strings as the vebrane is dragged

across the threebranes.

as has been pointed out by various people [44, 45], in the context of the anti-

de sitter/conformal eld theory (ads/cft) correspondence there are general reasons

to expect n fundamental strings to join together on a d5-brane wrapped on a ve-

sphere in the throat region of the threebrane geometry (i.e. the ads geometry). this is

the string theory counterpart to the gauge theory su(n) baryon vertex, representing

a bound state of n external quarks. the baryon vertex has been studied in [46], where

the strings and the vebrane are described in terms of separate nambu-goto actions.

35

that approach ignores the worldvolume gauge eld on the vebrane.

its inclusion

leads to the born-infeld action, which allows a unied description of the vebrane

and the strings. when restricted to the ads background, our solutions provide an

explicit string theory representation of the baryon vertex. the born-infeld action for

the worldbrane dynamics of the vebrane in a threebrane background is an accessible

and instructive way to go after the energetics of this problem.

in the second part of this chapter we study baryon congurations in large n non-

supersymmetric su(n) gauge theories, applying the ads/cft correspondence. this

part is based on a paper [13] by c.g. callan, a. guijosa, o. tafjord and myself. using

the d5-brane worldvolume theory in the near-horizon geometry of non-extremal d3-

branes, we nd embeddings which describe baryonic states in three-dimensional qcd.

in particular, we construct solutions corresponding to a baryon made of n quarks,

and study what happens when some fraction  of the total number of quarks are

bodily moved to a large spatial separation from the others. the individual clumps of

quarks are represented by born-infeld string tubes obtained from a d5-brane whose
spatial section has topology r  s4. they are connected by a conning color ux
tube, described by a portion of the vebrane that runs very close and parallel to the

horizon. we nd that this ux tube has a tension with a nontrivial -dependence (not

previously obtained by other methods).

3.1 baryons in ads

in this chapter we will construct solutions of the born-infeld action for a d5-brane

in the background of a stack of n d3-branes. by building on some recent work of

imamura [54], we can nd bps-saturated solutions which presumably correspond to

exact solutions of string theory. using the general approach of [6, 7], these solutions

use d5-branes wrapped in various ways to describe branes and strings attached to each

36

other. the primary object we construct this way is a d5-brane joined to n d3-branes

by a bundle of fundamental strings. our solutions give a detailed description of the

creation of these strings as the vebrane is dragged across the threebranes.

as has been pointed out by various people [44, 45], in the context of the anti-

de sitter/conformal eld theory (ads/cft) correspondence there are general reasons

to expect n fundamental strings to join together on a d5-brane wrapped on a ve-

sphere in the throat region of the threebrane geometry (i.e. in the ads geometry). this

is the string theory counterpart to the gauge theory su(n) baryon vertex, representing

a bound state of n external quarks. the baryon vertex has been studied in [46], where

the strings and the vebrane are described in terms of separate nambu-goto actions.

that approach ignores the worldvolume gauge eld on the vebrane.

its inclusion

leads to the born-infeld action, which allows a unied description of the vebrane

and the strings. when restricted to the ads background, our solutions provide an

explicit string theory representation of the baryon vertex. the born-infeld action for

the worldbrane dynamics of the vebrane in a threebrane background is an accessible

and instructive way to go after the energetics of this problem.

3.1.1 the setup

we set up the equations for the born-infeld d5-brane in the background geometry of

a stack of n d3-branes. the metric in a standard coordinate system is

ds2 = h(r)1/2(dt2 + dx2
||

) + h(r)1/2(dr2 + r2d2

5),

h(r) = a + r4/r4 .

we have chosen to express h(r) in terms of an auxiliary constant a, in order to treat the
asymptotically at d3-brane (a = 1) and the ads5  s5 (a = 0) geometries in parallel.
the worldvolume action is the born-infeld action calculated using the induced metric

(including the worldvolume gauge eld)

gind
 = gm n x m x n + f,

37

plus the wzw term induced by the ve-form eld strength; the latter is basically a

source term for the worldvolume gauge eld. the explicit action we will use is

s = t5z d6qdet(gind) + t5z d6ax m1  . . . x m5gm1...m5 ,

where t5 is the d5-brane tension and the second term is the explicit wzw coupling of

the worldvolume gauge eld a to the background ve-form eld strength g. we use

the target space time and s5 spherical coordinates as worldvolume coordinates for the

vebrane,  = (t, ).

we pick a ve-sphere surrounding a point on the threebrane stack and look for

static solutions of the form r() and a0() (with all other elds set to zero), where

 is the polar angle in spherical coordinates. non-static solutions are of interest too,

but we will not deal with them in this paper. on substituting explicit forms for the

threebrane metric and the ve-form eld strength, the action (for static congurations)

simplies to

s = t54z dtd sin4 {r4h(r)qr2 + (r)2  f 2

0 + 4a0r4},

(3.1)

where 4 = 82/3 denotes the volume of the unit four-sphere.

the gauge eld equation of motion following from this action reads

(sin )4" sin4 

(ar4 + r4)e

r2 + r2  e2# = 4r4 ,

where we have set e = f0 and the right-hand side is the source term coming from

the wzw action. it is helpful to repackage this in terms of the displacement d (the

variation of the action with respect to e):

d =

sin4 (ar4 + r4)e

r2 + r2  e2  d() = 4r4 sin4 .

(3.2)

obviously, we can integrate the equation for d to nd it as an explicit function of

. the result is

d() = r4(cid:20) 3

2

(  ) +

3
2

38

sin  cos  + sin3  cos (cid:21) ,

(3.3)

where the integration constant has been written in terms of a parameter 0    1,
whose meaning will be elucidated below. notice that the sign of the wzw term in

(3.1) reects the choice of a particular vebrane orientation. choosing the opposite

orientation therefore reverses the sign of the source term in (3.2), and consequently the

sign of d.

since d, unlike e, is completely unaected by the form of the function r(), it

makes sense to express the action in terms of d and regard the result as a functional

for r().

it is best to do this by a legendre transformation, rewriting the original

lagrangian as

u = t54z d{d  e + sin4 (ar4 + r4)qr2 + (r)2  e2} .

integrating the de term by parts using e = a0, one reproduces (with a sign
switch) the original lagrangian. using (3.2) we can eliminate e in favor of d to get

the desired functional of r() alone:

u = t54z dqr2 + (r)2qd2 + (ar4 + r4)2 sin8 .

(3.4)

this functional is reasonably simple, but complicated by the fact that there is

explicit dependence on . hence there is no simple energy-conservation rst integral

that we can use to solve the equations (or at least analyse possible solutions). for

future reference, we record the euler-lagrange equations that follow from (3.26):

r

d

d(cid:16)

r2 + r2qd2 + (ar4 + r4)2 sin8 (cid:17) =

r
r2 + r2qd2 + (ar4 + r4)2 sin8 
r2 + r2

4ar4(ar4 + r4) sin8 

+

r

qd2 + (ar4 + r4)2 sin8 

. (3.5)

supersymmetry considerations will allow us to go rather far in analysing the solutions

of this formidable-looking equation.

when we discuss solutions in more detail, we will see that it will not be possible

to wrap the vebrane smoothly around a sphere. even if r()  r0 for most , we

39

will nd that for    (or 0), r shoots o to innity in a way that simulates a
bundle of fundamental strings in the manner described in [6, 7]. using (3.26) we can

already verify that the energy of such a spike is consistent with its interpretation as

a bundle of strings. suppose that the spike sticks out at  = ; then d will take on

some nite value d() at  = . as we go into the spike, r will dominate r and the

d term will dominate sin8 . it is clear then that the spike has a tension (i.e. an

energy per unit radial coordinate distance) t54|d()|. using the known facts that
d() = 3(  1)r4/2 and t54r4 = 2ntf /3, it follows that the tension of the
spike is that of n fundamental strings, ntf , where n = (1  )n. this gives meaning
to the parameter .

3.1.2 supersymmetry issues

we are interested in placing a d5-brane in a d3-brane background and nding a

structure that looks like fundamental strings attached to the d3-branes. insight into

what is possible is often obtained by looking for brane orientations such that the

various brane supersymmetry conditions are mutually compatible for some number of

supersymmetries.

in type iib supergravity in ten-dimensional at space, there are

32 supersymmetries generated by two 16-component constant majorana-weyl spinors

l, r of like parity (11l,r = l,r).

in the presence of branes of various kinds,

the number of supersymmetries is reduced by the imposition of further conditions.

explicitly,

09r = +r,

09l = l,

f  string :
d3  brane : 0123l = +r, 0123r = l,
d5  brane : 045678l = +r, 045678r = +l,

(3.6)

where the particular gamma matrix products are determined by the embedding of the

relevant branes into ten-dimensional space. for instance, the d3-brane condition refers

40

to a brane that spans the 123 coordinate directions. conditions can be multiplied by an

overall sign by changing brane orientation.1 the existence of a bps state containing

more than one type of brane depends on the existence of simultaneous solutions of

more than one of the above equations. the relevant point for our discussion is that the

conditions precisely as written above, corresponding to mutually perpendicular d3-

branes, d5-branes and f-strings, are compatible with eight supersymmetries (n = 2
in usual parlance). the supersymmetry argument suggests that mutually orthogonal

branes spanning a total of eight dimensions joined by a fundamental string running

along the one remaining dimension (perpendicular to both branes) should in fact be

a stable bps state. an interesting aspect of our born-infeld worldvolume approach

is that we will explicitly see how the fundamental strings are created and destroyed

as the d-branes are moved past each other in the ninth direction (the hanany-witten

eect [48, 49, 50]).

the above analysis has been carried out in at space. to make contact with the

ads/cft correspondence, one would want to consider n superposed d3-branes with

n large, in which case the background geometry is not at and the supersymmetry

analysis given above is at least incomplete. imamura [54] has analysed the supersym-

metry conditions associated with a d5-brane stretched over some surface in the throat
of the d3-brane (where the geometry is ads5  s5 and there is a ux of the rr ve-
form eld strength through the s5). there are several new features here: rst, the

unbroken supersymmetries of type iib supergravity in this particular background are

32 position-dependent spinors (as opposed to constant spinors in at space); second,

because of the rr ve-form eld strength, there is a worldbrane gauge eld induced

on the worldvolume of the d5-brane; third, the condition that a particular element of

the d5-brane worldvolume preserve some supersymmetry involves the local orientation

1notice, however, that to maintain a supersymmetric conguration one must simultaneously reverse

the orientation of two of the three objects.

41

of the brane, the value of the induced worldvolume gauge eld and the local value

of the supergravity supersymmetry spinors. since the d5-brane is embedded in some

nontrivial way in the geometry, the supersymmetry condition is in principle dierent

at each point on the worldvolume and it is far from obvious that it can be satised

everywhere.

however, imamura [54] was able to show that these conditions boil down, at least

in the ads5 (a = 0) background, to a rst-order equation for the embedding of the

d5-brane into the space transverse to the d3-brane stack. in our language, his bps

condition can be written

r
r

=

r4 sin5  + d() cos 

r4 sin4  cos   d() sin 

,

(3.7)

where r = r() is the d5-brane embedding in the transverse space and d() is the dis-

placement eld describing how the worldvolume gauge eld varies from point to point.

it is easy to show that any function r() that satises this condition automatically sat-

ises the euler-lagrange equation (3.5) with a = 0; in that sense it is a rst integral

of the usual second-order equations. note that, as mentioned above, the structure of

the action is such that there is no trivial energy rst integral. the bps condition (3.7)

can be integrated analytically to obtain a two-parameter family of curves that describe
bps embeddings of a d5-brane into the ads5  s5 geometry. these solutions will be
discussed in the next section.

we are also interested in exploring the analogous solutions in the full asymptot-

ically at d3-brane background (a = 1). in this background the interpretation and

energetics of solutions should be quite straightforward. what is less obvious is how to

nd bps solutions. to follow imamuras approach, one would rst nd the supersym-

metry spinors in the d3-brane background, use them to construct local supersymmetry

conditions for an embedded d5-brane and from this nd the condition on the embed-

ding for there to be a global worldvolume supersymmetry. this is no doubt perfectly

42

feasible but we have not had the patience to try it. instead, we have simply guessed a
generalization of the ads5  s5 bps condition that automatically provides a solution
of the euler-lagrange equations in the full d3-brane background. the generalized
bps condition is obtained by making the (very plausible) replacement r4  r4 + r4
in (3.7),

r
r

=

(r4 + r4) sin5  + d() cos 

(r4 + r4) sin4  cos   d() sin 

.

(3.8)

it is easy to verify, using only (3.2), that this equation implies the full euler-lagrange

equation (3.5) with a = 1, so it is certainly a rst integral. given its origin, it is

almost certainly the bps condition as well. it is rather surprising that things work so

smoothly, and we take this as another evidence of the special nature of the d3-brane

background. the rst-order equation (3.8) must be integrated numerically (as far as

we know) and yields a two-parameter family of solutions whose structure is quite non-

trivial. exploration of these and the ads solutions will be the subject of the rest of

the paper.

before closing this section we note that in either background one can obtain an

alternative bps condition by reversing the signs in front of d in equations (3.7) or

(3.8). the resulting condition would guarantee the preservation of a dierent set of

supersymmetries, albeit just as many.

in order to still have a rst integral of the

euler-lagrange equation (3.5), d must satisfy (3.2) with the opposite sign for the

source term. such oppositely oriented vebrane congurations will actually have the

same embedding r().

3.1.3 ads background: born-infeld baryons

we start with a discussion of the solutions of the ads bps equation (3.7) for the
supersymmetric embedding of a vebrane in the ads5  s5 geometry, with topology

43

s4  r. fortunately, the bps equation has the following simple analytic solution:2

r() =

a

sin  "

()

(1  )#1/3

,

() =     sin  cos ,

(3.9)

where the scale factor a is arbitrary, and  is the integration constant in (3.25). the

freedom of changing a is a direct consequence of the scale invariance of the ads

background: if r() is a solution of (3.7), then so is r() for any . note that  > 0

(so that the solution makes sense) only for cr <  < , where cr is dened by

 = cr  sin cr cos cr.

(3.10)

this critical angle increases monotonically from zero to  as  increases from zero to

one. furthermore, when cr > 0, r(cr) = 0, a fact whose consequences will be explored

below.

the fact that (if  6= 1) the solution diverges as r  a/(  ) when    means
that a polar plot of r() has, asymptotically, the shape of a tube of radius a. (this

way of describing the surface is a bit misleading as to the intrinsic geometry, but helps in

visualization.) this tube is to be interpreted as a bundle of fundamental strings running

o to innity in the space transverse to the d3-branes. as explained in subsection 3.1.1,

the asymptotic tension of the tube equals that of (1  )n fundamental strings. for
the classical solutions  is a continuous parameter, but at the quantum level  should

obey the quantization rule  = n/n.

in figure. 3.1 we have plotted (3.9) for some representative values of . consider

rst the special case  = 0, which yields a tube with the maximal asymptotic tension

ntf and corresponds to the classic baryon vertex. in this case the solution starts at a

nite radius r(0) = (2/3)1/3a, with r(0) = 0, and then r() increases monotonically

with . the initial radius r(0) represents another way of setting the overall scale of

this scale-invariant solution. the fact that the vebrane surface stays away from the

figure 3.1: polar plots of r() for ads tube solutions corresponding to (1  )n
strings (with  =  at the top of the plots). a cross-section of each tube is an s4.

horizon at r = 0 suggests that it is well-decoupled from degrees of freedom living on

the the threebranes. as far as the bps equation is concerned, it seems to make sense

to consider the  > 0 solutions as well. they have instructive features, although we

will eventually conclude that they are on a less sound footing than their  = 0 cousins.

for large r, the solution asymptotes to the familiar tube with a tension corresponding

to (1  )n < n strings:
gauge theory. as mentioned above, for  > 0, the surface intersects r = 0 at an angle

it corresponds to a general multi-quark state of a u(n)

cr > 0 dened by (3.31), leading to the cusp-like congurations displayed in fig. 3.1.
note that, because the r  0 cusp has a nite opening angle, the vebrane does not
capture all of the ve-form ux: this is closely related to the fact that the asymptotic

tension is (1  )n and not n.

as   0, the opening angle cr  0. the approach to the  = 0 solution, which
does not contact r = 0, is achieved, as shown in fig. 3.1, via a tensionless string

connecting the minimum radius of the  = 0 solution to r = 0 (indicated as a dotted

line in the gure). at the other extreme,   1, one has cr  , and the solution
collapses to a similar phantom string, this time running from r = 0 to innity.

one can compare the total energy of these congurations to that of (1  )n
fundamental strings (this was done in [54] for the case of  = 0). using the solution

45

(3.9) in expression (3.26), the energy of the vebrane up to an angular cuto max can

be put in the form

u(max) = ntf

(3.11)

the fundamental string energy, on the other hand, for strings extending from the origin

to a radial cuto rmax = r(max), is simply estr(max) = (1 )ntf r(max). it is easy
to check numerically that estr(max)  u(max)  0 as max   (rmax  ). the
born-infeld vebrane tubes can be therefore regarded as threshold bound states of

(1  )n fundamental strings. we emphasize that this holds for any value of the
scale parameter a: as max  , the energy u(max) becomes independent of a. the
parameter a is therefore a modulus in the space of equal-energy solutions.

a complication for the interpretation of these solutions is that, in general (speci-

cally, when  6= 0, 1/2, 1), the total ve-form ux captured by the vebrane diers from
the number of fundamental strings, (1  )n, indicated by the asymptotic tension or
total energy. the fundamental string charge is the source of the displacement eld d,

and we can rearrange (3.2) to show that a vebrane that runs from  = cr to  = 

intercepts a total ve-form ux

qf lux = 

2n
3r4 [d()  d(cr)] = (1  )n +

2n
3

sin3 cr cos cr .

from the value of the tension, we would have expected a total charge qtot = (1  )n
on the d5-brane. the dierence,3

qmissing = 

2n
3r4 sin3 cr cos cr ,

(3.12)

is nonzero for  6= 0, 1/2, 1 and presumably must be accounted for by a point charge
at r = 0. since r = 0 is where the vebrane makes contact with the threebranes,

this reminds us that, in order to be fully consistent, we should take into account

3it should be clear that qf lux, qtot, and qmissing all change sign if we reverse the vebrane

orientation.

46

the possibility of exciting the threebrane worldvolume u(n) gauge elds when we

attach fundamental strings to the d3-branes (as in [6, 7]). the case of n strings

( = 0) is special since they can be in a u(n) singlet which will decouple from the

d3-brane worldvolume gauge theory. when  6= 0, we are talking about a collection
of strings that cannot be u(n) neutral and must excite the d3 gauge elds, which

will in turn react back on the metric. since we have not allowed for this possibility in

our construction, the detailed features of our solutions with qmissing 6= 0 have to be
taken with a certain grain of salt. the case  = 1/2 is peculiar: it corresponds to n/2

strings and so cannot form a u(n) singlet, yet has qmissing = 0. we are not sure that

it really has the same status as the true singlet  = 0 solution.

in light of the ads/cft correspondence [41, 42, 43], the above results are expected

to have a gauge theory interpretation. as discussed by several people [44, 45], a baryon

(a bound state of n external quarks) in the su(n) n = 4 supersymmetric yang-mills
(sym) theory corresponds, in the dual ads description, to n fundamental strings

which join together on a d5-brane wrapped on an s5 at some radius. the born-

infeld  = 0 vebrane conguration described above provides a detailed representation

of such a baryon.

in particular, the absence of binding energy is as expected for a

bps threshold bound state in the n = 4 theory. our other solutions with  = n/n
(0 < n < n) are also bps and correspond to threshold bound states of n  n quarks.
the existence of color non-neutral states with nite (renormalized) energy is perfectly

reasonable in a non-conning theory. to start learning something interesting about

these states, we would have to go beyond mere energetics and ask some dynamical

questions. to be absolutely clear, we emphasize that in every case discussed here the

quarks in the gauge theory are all at the same spatial location.

the solutions that we have discussed so far are naturally restricted to the range

of angles cr     where () > 0. we will call them upper tubes. a simple
modication of (3.9) is valid for the complementary angular range 0    cr where

47

() < 0:

r() =

a

sin  "()

 #1/3

.

(3.13)

this expression is singular at  = 0 (where r()  a/) and meets the origin at
 = cr. it represents a downward-pointing tube of radius a whose shape and tension
are the same as for an upward-pointing tube with parameter 1  . in other words,
r(; ) = r(  ; 1  ). this lower tube solution intercepts a total ux qf lux =
n + 2n sin3 cr cos cr/3. from the tension of this conguration, we would have
expected a total charge qtot = n, so there is a charge qmissing localized at the
origin which is again given by (3.12). if the upper tube solution corresponds to some

number of quarks, the lower tube solution corresponds to some number of antiquarks.

finally we want to speculate about constructing new solutions by combining the

 6= 0 solutions we have been discussing. specically, we are interested in obtaining
congurations for which the peculiar charge at the origin cancels. inspection of (3.12)

shows that this can be achieved by merging two tubes whose opening angles are com-

plementary. using equation (3.31) this means that if one of the tubes has parameter ,

the other one must have parameter 1  . taking into account the possibility of using
upper or lower solutions, one is thus led to two types of congurations, illustrated

in fig. 3.2.

the combination of two upper tubes with parameters  and 1   yields a baryon-
like conguration corresponding to a total of n quarks. this system diers from the

 = 0 baryon of fig. 3.1 in that the strings have been separated into two distinct

coaxial tubes. it is interesting to note that this combined structure can be obtained

as a single solution of (3.7), with a unique value of , by formally continuing r() in

(3.9) beyond  = cr (where r = 0) to negative values of r. the continued solution,

depicted in fig. 3.2, can be interpreted as a single surface which intersects itself at the

origin. in this interpretation the parameter  is an additional modulus of the baryon,

controlling how many strings (out of the total of n) lie in each tube.

if instead one puts together an upper  and a lower 1   solution, the result

quarks and the same number of antiquarks. (this is still bps, because the quarks

and antiquarks have opposite su(4) quantum numbers.) the total charge of the state

vanishes.

judging from the cancellation of the charge at the origin, these combined solutions

would appear to have the same status as the baryon. on the other hand, it is unclear

to what extent these superposed tubes can be regarded as a single object, given that

they are connected only at the innitely distant point r = 0. it would be interesting

to see whether uctuations propagating inward along one tube can tunnel through

the point at r = 0 to propagate outward along the second tube.

49

3.2 hanany-witten eect in the full d3-brane met-

ric background

so far, we have looked at the static solutions of d5-branes in the ads5  s5 geometry
of the throat region of the exterior geometry of a large number of d3-branes. as we

now know, this limit gives us a supergravity description of n = 4 sym theory. we
can also shed light on some old string theory questions by studying the same types of

congurations in the full asymptotically at geometry of multiple d3-branes.

to examine the character of the solutions in the asymptotically at d3-brane back-

ground, it is convenient to parametrize the solution by z = z(), where  = r sin , and

z = r cos . in these variables, adapted to at space, the bps condition (3.8) reads

z() = d(arctan(/z))
(2+z2)2(cid:17)

4(cid:16)1 + r4

.

(3.14)

solutions to this equation describe d5-brane congurations which asymptote to a at

plane as    (equivalently,   /2). the leading asymptotic behavior following
from (3.14) is

z() = zmax +

d(/2)

33 + o r4
4 ! ,

(3.15)

where zmax denotes the transverse position of the at brane. we will be interested in

studying how the solution changes as we vary zmax.

figures 3.3 and 3.4 show the congurations obtained by integrating (3.14) numeri-

cally for  = 0 and  = 1/2 and for a few representative values of zmax. the stack of

n d3-branes is at the origin, and extends along directions perpendicular to the gure.

for any value of zmax, the d5-brane captures the same fraction of the total ve-form

ux, which (in conjunction with a possible point charge at the origin, as discussed in

the previous subsection) eectively endows the d5-brane with a total of (1/2  )n
units of charge. note the shift of n/2 units of charge, compared with the analogous

situation in ads space: this happens because the asymptotic region of the brane is

50

now at  = /2 rather than  = . this will have interesting consequences.

figure 3.3: solutions describing the creation of n fundamental strings as a d5-brane
is dragged upward, across a stack of d3-branes. the number of strings connecting the
two types of branes changes from 0 to n.

consider rst the situation for  = 0, described graphically in figure 3.3. as

zmax  , the charge density vanishes, and the d5-brane of course becomes at. as
one approaches the stack of threebranes from below (zmax  0), the charge becomes
more and more localized near the center of the vebrane, and the conguration becomes

slightly deformed, bending away from the origin. as zmax increases, the d5-brane
remains hung-up on the d3-brane stack at r = 0 and a tube of topology s4  r gets
drawn out. the total charge of the tube itself approaches n as it gets longer and longer

and it becomes indistinguishable from a bundle of n fundamental strings. curiously,

when the bundle eventually connects to the at d5-brane, a region of negative ve-

form ux is encountered and the total charge intercepted by the vebrane drops to

n/2 (for any zmax). altogether, then, this family of solutions provides a very concrete

picture of the creation of fundamental strings as a vebrane is dragged over a stack of

threebranes, the hanany-witten eect [48, 49, 50].

for  > 0 the story is modied in exactly the same way as in the previous subsection.

figure 3.4: solutions describing the creation of n fundamental strings as a d5-brane
is dragged across a stack of d3-branes. the number of strings connecting the two
types of branes changes from n/2 to +n/2 (the signs indicate whether the strings
originate or terminate on the vebrane).

for either sign of zmax, the vebrane now reaches the origin, r = 0, at an angle  = min
given in terms of  by equation (3.31). as zmax   the solution describes now
a vebrane connected by n strings to the stack of threebranes. for deniteness,

assume the choice of sign for d (i.e., the orientation of the vebrane) is such that the

strings emanate from the d5-brane and terminate on the d3-branes. upon moving

past zmax = 0, n strings directed towards the vebrane are created, and as zmax  
(1  )n strings directed away from the threebranes extend between the two types of
branes. the case  = 1/2 is portrayed in figure 3.4.

it is instructive to compare the solution described above to the description of fun-

damental strings attached to a vebrane as a coulomb solution of the vebrane born-

infeld theory [6, 7]. in the latter case the parent brane is embedded in at space and

the worldvolume gauge eld is simply that of a point charge. for n units of charge,

the spike conguration that protrudes from the brane at the location of the charge is

52

of the form

z() = zmax 

nc5
3 ,

(3.16)

where c5 = 22gs()2 is the quantum of charge. writing this in terms of the threebrane

throat radius r = (4ngs()2)1/4, one can readily verify that the asymptotic form
(3.15) agrees with the solution (3.16) for n = (1/2  )n strings. this is precisely as
one would expect from the above discussion, for the entire vebrane captures precisely

a fraction (1/2  ) of the total ve-form ux. by the same token, it is clear that the
present solution is of a more complex nature than that of [6, 7]. the conguration

discussed here corresponds roughly to a solution which is locally of the type (3.16),

but where the charge n varies as one changes position on the vebrane.

one of the more confusing features of the hanany-witten eect is its energetics:

does the created string exert a force and, if so, how is that consistent with the bps prop-

erty? we can shed some light on this by computing the energy of our congurations.

in terms of the z() parametrization, and using the fact that t54r4 = 2ntf /3,

equation (3.26) becomes

u = ntf

2

3 z dq1 + (z)2vuutd2 + 8"1 +

r4

.

(3.17)

we can use the bps condition (3.14) to express the energy integrand for our solutions

solely as a function of z and ,

u = ntf

.

(3.18)

now, the energy of the innite d5-brane is evidently divergent, so (3.18) must

be regularized.

if we do so by placing a cuto c on , the leading and subleading

contributions to (3.18) are clearly quintic and linear in c, respectively. the oending

terms, however, are independent of zmax, so we choose to simply drop them (thereby

removing an innite constant from u). altogether, then, we subtract 4 + r4 from the

53

integrand of (3.18) to obtain the expression

u(zmax, c) = ntf

(3.19)

which is nite as the cuto is removed. using the numerical solutions, one nds that
in fact u  (1/2  )ntf zmax for all zmax as c  .

since the dierence between u and u is a constant, it readily follows that there is

a net constant force on the vebrane, independent of zmax:



zmax

u(zmax, c)  (cid:18)1

2  (cid:19) ntf

as c  .

(3.20)

the total force equals the tension of (1/2 )n fundamental strings as a consequence
of the fact that the full conguration carries a total of (1/2  )n units of charge. it
might seem surprising at rst that there is a force on the vebrane even for  = 0 and

zmax < 0 (i.e., before the d5-brane crosses the d3-brane stack and a tube of strings

is created), but one must keep in mind that even then there is a charge on the brane,

and consequently a position-dependent energy. after the vebrane is moved past the

threebranes, to zmax > 0, a bundle of fundamental strings is created, and this bundle
pulls down on the vebrane with a force which tends to ntf as zmax  . the net
force on the brane is still (1/2  )ntf , however, because the outer portion of the
brane now carries negative charge, as a consequence of which there is an additional,

upward force on the brane. our approach thus makes it absolutely clear that, contrary

to the naive expectation, there is no discontinuity in the force as the branes cross.

one is able to nd static solutions despite the presence of a constant force because the

d5-brane is innitely massive, and therefore will not move. if desired, this constant

force can be cancelled by placing (1  2)n additional d3-branes at z = .

an alternative way to reach the same conclusions is to compute the force by cutting

o (3.17) at c and dierentiating with respect to zmax under the integral (regarding

z = z(; zmax)). after an integration by parts and an application of the euler-lagrange

54

equation, one is left only with a boundary term, which yields the analytic expression

(3.21)

using (3.21) and (3.15) one can again conclude that the force on the vebrane ap-

proaches (1/2  )ntf as c   at a xed zmax. furthermore, using the numerical
solution in conjunction with (3.21), one can compute the force on the  < c portion of

the brane, for any value of c. for any xed c, it is easy to see that the force tends to
(1  )ntf (ntf ) as zmax   (zmax  ). taking the limit this way picks out
the stress on the string tube part of the conguration and yields the expected tension

of (1 )n (n) fundamental strings. nonetheless, the total asymptotic stress on the
d5-brane is smaller by n/2 fundamental string units, due to the extra ve-form ux

intercepted by the at part of the d5-brane.

notice that for  = 1/2 the net force on the d5-brane vanishes. this is because in

that case the total charge on the brane is zero. as a result, the 3 term in (3.15) has

a vanishing coecient. this conguration has z( = 0) = z( = 0) = 0, min = /2,

and d(min) = 0. it is only for this and the  = 0 and  = 1 cases that the point

charge at the origin vanishes. this solution (depicted in fig. 3.4) describes a bundle

of n/2 strings which ip their orientation as the vebrane to which they are attached

is moved above or below the threebrane stack. the number of attached strings still

changes by n, from n/2 to +n/2, as the d5-brane is pulled through the stack.
this conguration is thus a realization of the half-string ground-state of the system

described in [50]. for reasons explained in that paper, and conrmed by our energy

analysis, this is the only solution which is in a state of neutral equilibrium.

just as in the previous subsection, one could imagine combining solutions to ob-

tain congurations in which the charge at the origin vanishes. we will focus attention

here on the possibility of superposing two solutions with parameters , zmax > 0 and

55

figure 3.5: solution describing a system of two parallel d5-branes connected by (1 
)n fundamental strings which run through the d3-branes at r = 0. a point w-boson
charge lies at the origin.

1  ,zmax, respectively. the complete structure obtained this way is illustrated in
figure d5d5strings, and corresponds to a conguration in which two innite parallel

d5-branes with the same orientation, located at zmax, are connected by (1  )n
fundamental strings running through the n d3-branes at the origin. something inter-

esting has happened here: we have constructed an excitation of a system of two paral-

lel vebranes, something which should more properly be described by the non-abelian

su(2) born-infeld action. we have achieved this eect (perhaps illegitimately!) by

gluing together two u(1) solutions at the singularity provided by the d3-branes. the

logic of this construction is similar in spirit to a previous attempt to construct prasad-

sommereld monopole congurations from born-infeld dynamics [55]. following that

interpretation, the point charges of the component solutions at the origin should be

understood not to cancel, but to combine instead into a point w-boson charge which

interpolates, at no cost in energy, between the two u(1)s of the overall broken u(2)

symmetry.

56

the threebrane background geometry evidently plays a role in facilitating the con-

struction described above. nevertheless, since the strings in the solution are inter-

preted as merely passing through the d3-branes, it is natural to conjecture that there

exist neighboring static vebrane congurations in which the strings miss the origin.

deforming the system in this manner it would be possible to move the connecting

strings arbitrarily far away from the threebranes, thereby producing the analogous at

space conguration. it would be very interesting to pursue this issue further.

3.3 the baryon in three dimensions

the born-infeld action plus an appropriate wess-zumino term denes a worldvolume

theory for d-branes which has proved to be a powerful way to describe these objects and

their excitations. in the context of maldacenas correspondence between supergravity

in anti-de sitter (ads) space and certain gauge theories [41, 42, 43], there are gauge

theory questions which can be answered by the study of branes extended in curved

space.

in particular, it was shown in a general way that the large-nc dynamics of

baryons can be related to the behavior of d5-branes extended in ads space [44, 45].

concrete realizations of this possiblity in the context of the non-conning n = 4
supersymmetric gauge theory have been worked out in [12, 29] using the born-infeld

approach for constructing strings out of d-branes [6, 7]. in this paper, we will look at

how these constructions work in the more complicated spacetimes that correspond to

various conning gauge theories. we will examine conning forces by looking at what

happens to baryons when they are pulled apart into their quark constituents. this will

be compared to (and yields somewhat more information than) the study of conning

forces via simple strings that hang into the ads geometry from a boundary wilson

loop [28, 32, 47, 45].

in this section, we extend our previous work [12] on d5-branes in extremal back-

57

ground in three ways. first, we will study non-extremal supergravity backgrounds,

corresponding to gauge theories dimensionally reduced in a way that breaks supersym-

metry. second, we allow the brane congurations to have extension in the spacetime

coordinates of the gauge-theory instead of being localized at a point. this will allow

us to describe a baryon which is being pulled apart into quark constituents.

we start out in section 3.3 by analysing baryons in a (2+1)-dimensional su(n)

yang-mills theory which is obtained from (3+1)-dimensions by compactifying on a

supersymmetry breaking circle. as proposed in [53], this gauge theory is dual to a

certain non-extremal d3-brane geometry4 and, following [12], we study solutions of

the d5-brane worldvolume equations of motion in that geometry. we nd a class

of solutions that are localized in the gauge theory spatial coordinates and appear

to describe the baryon. unlike the baryons constructed in the extremal background

[12, 29], these solutions have no moduli since the quarks are truly bound in the baryon.

we then study a new class of solutions in which the n quarks are separated into two

groups, containing n and (1)n quarks respectively, separated by a spatial distance
l in the gauge theory. the l-dependence of the energy of these solutions is consistent

with connement and the implied color ux tube tension has a non-trivial dependence

on the color charge .

3.3.1 worldvolume action and equations of motion

we derive the equations for a d5-brane embedded in the near-horizon geometry of n

nonextremal d3-branes. the euclidean background metric is

r(cid:19)2
ds2 = (cid:18) r
f (r) = 1  r4

f (r)1dr2 + r2d2

non-supersymmetric yang-mills theories.

58

where {, x||} = {, x, y, z} denote the directions parallel to the threebranes. the
coordinate  is periodic, with period 1/t , where t is the hawking temperature. the

relation between the horizon radius rh and t ensures smoothness of the geometry at

r = rh.

under the ads/cft correspondence [41, 42, 43], type iib string theory on a back-

ground with the above metric, a constant dilaton, and n units of veform ux through

the ve-sphere, is dual to n = 4, d = 3 + 1 su(n) sym theory at temperature t ,
with coupling g2
y m4 = 2gs. the gauge theory coordinates are {x, y, z, }. for large
t the  circle becomes small and one eectively obtains a description of a strongly-

coupled (coupling g2

y m3 = g2

y m4t ) three-dimensional euclidean gauge theory at zero

temperature. the thermal boundary conditions on the circle break supersymmetry

and the fermions and scalars acquire masses of order t and g2

y m4t , respectively. the

eective three-dimensional theory is expected to display behavior similar to that of

non-supersymmetric pure yang-mills theory, qcd3 [53].

a baryon (a bound state of n external quarks) in the three-dimensional theory has

as its string theory counterpart a vebrane wrapped on an s5 on which n fundamental

strings terminate [44, 45]. the vebrane worldvolume action is

s = t5z d6qdet(g + f ) + t5z a(1)  g(5) ,

where t5 = 1/(cid:16)gs(2)5ls

6(cid:17) is the brane tension. the born-infeld term involves the

induced metric g and the u(1) worldvolume eld strength f(2) = da(1). the second

term is the wess-zumino coupling of the worldvolume gauge eld a(1) to (the pullback

of) the background ve-form eld strength g(5), which eectively endows the vebrane

with a u(1) charge proportional to the s5 solid angle that it spans.

for a static baryon we need a conguration invariant under translations in the

gauge theory time direction, which we take to be y. we parametrize the world volume

of the vebrane by six parameters , 1, 2, 3, 4 and s. the embedding of this

59

vebrane into 10-dimensional target space is dened by

1 = 1,
x = x(s),
2 = 2,
y = ,
z = const = 0, 3 = 3,
4 = 4,
t = const = 0,
r = r(s),
5 = (s),

(3.23)

where only x, 5 and r are functions of the parameter s. this restricts our attention

to so(5) symmetric congurations, i.e. the ones invariant under rotations about the

principal polar axis with respect to which 5 is measured. the action then simplies

to

s = t54r4z d ds sin4 {qr22 + r2/f (r) + (r/r)4x2  f 2

y + 4ay},

(3.24)

where 4 = 82/3 is the volume of the unit four-sphere.

the gauge eld equation of motion following from this action reads

d() = 4 sin4 ,

where the dimensionless displacement d is the variation of the action with respect to

e = fy. note, that fy originally was a magnetic eld in the 4-dimensional theory,

but became the electric eld in the three-dimensional theory, since y plays now the

role of time.

the solution to this equation is

d() = (cid:20)3

2

(  ) +

3
2

sin  cos  + sin3  cos (cid:21) .

(3.25)

as will be explained below, the integration constant 0    1 controls the number
of born-infeld strings emerging from each pole of the s5. next, it is convenient to

eliminate the gauge eld in favor of d and legendre transform the original lagrangian

to obtain an energy functional of the embedding coordinate r() only:

u = t54r4z dsqr22 + r2/f (r) + (r/r)4x2qd()2 + sin8  .

(3.26)

60

this action has the interesting scaling property that if {r(s), (s), x(s)} is a solution
for horizon radius rh, then {r(s), (s), 1x(s)} is a solution for horizon radius rh.
the scaling x  r2/r is precisely as expected from the holographic uv/ir relation
[51, 52]. we will have more to say about scaling behavior of solutions later on.

the vebrane embeddings of interest to us will have singularities: places on the
ve-sphere (typically    or 0) where r   and x  0. as in [12, 6, 7], these
spikes must be interpreted as bundles of fundamental strings attached to the wrapped

vebrane and localized at some denite value of x. it can be seen from (3.26) that a

spike sticking out at  =  has a tension (energy per unit radial coordinate distance)
t54r4|d()|f (r)1/2 = (1)ntf f (r)1/2, which is precisely the tension of (1)n
fundamental strings in this geometry. a spike at  = 0 has the same tension as n

strings so that, taken together, the two singularities represent a total of n fundamental

strings, as expected. surfaces with more singularities and less symmetry are perfectly

possible, but a lot harder to analyze. to keep things manageable, we have built so(5)

symmetry into the ansatz.

in the extremal case (rh = 0) discussed in [12], the bps condition provided a

rst integral which greatly simplied the analysis. in the nonextremal case we are now

discussing, there is no such rst integral and we have to deal with the unpleasant second

order euler-lagrange equation that follows from (3.26). this is most conveniently done

in a parametric hamiltonian formalism5. let us introduce the momenta conjugate to

r,  and x

p = r2 ,

px = (r/r)4 x,  =

d2 + sin8 

.

qr2 2 + r2/f + (r/r)4 x2

(3.27)

the hamiltonian that follows from the action (3.26) vanishes identically due to

reparametrization invariance in s. furthermore, the momentum expressions are non-

together with initial conditions, these equations completely dene the solutions for the

vebrane. the initial conditions should be chosen such that h = 0.

to gain some insight into the solutions to these equations, notice that the basic

problem to solve is a motion in the two-dimensional r   plane: the motion in x is
then determined by the choice of a conserved value for px. note that for px = 0, the

surface sits at a xed value of x and therefore has no spatial extension in the gauge

theory coordinates: we will call this a point solution. when r is large compared to
rh and rpx, the (r) motion is simply that of a particle of unit mass moving in two
dimensions under the inuence of the potential v () = hd()2 + sin8 i. by the

constraint, the energy of this ctitious particle vanishes. for generic , the potential

has three extrema (see figure 3.6): two minima at  = 0 and  = , and a maximum

at  = c such that  = c  sin c cos c. for large r the particle will thus roll down
towards one of the two minima. whether it reaches  = 0,  at a nite value of r

depends on the initial boundary conditions.

3.3.2 the point baryon

in this section we study solutions which correspond to a baryon localized at a particular

gauge theory position. to localize the surface in x, we just set px = 0. with the

symmetry that we have built in, the equations of motion typically allow the surface to

run o to r =  at  =  or 0. at least asymptotically, such spikes are equivalent
to bundles of fundamental strings and will be identied with the quark constituents

of the state represented by the wrapped vebrane. to get a baryon whose component

quarks have identical su(4) (avor) quantum numbers, we want a spike representing

n quarks to emerge from one pole of the s5 (say  = ) with a smooth surface at the

other pole. to meet the rst condition, it suces to set the integration constant  = 0

and to meet the second, we impose smooth boundary conditions (r = 0 and r = r0)

at  = 0.6

numerical integration with these boundary conditions yields a one-parameter family

of solutions (parametrized by r0). due to the scaling mentioned before, the solutions
really only depend on rh through the ratio  = r0/rh  1. figure 3.7 shows polar plots7
of the solutions for a few representative values of . when  < crit  9 the solution
tilts toward and eventually crosses the symmetry axis, thus reaching  =  at a nite

6this is equivalent to requiring pr = 0 at  = 0, in which case p must also vanish to satisfy the

constraint (3.28).

7although these plots provide a conveniently simple representation of the solutions, the reader
should bear in mind that they are a bit misleading as to the intrinsic geometry, since the radius of
the s5 is r, independent of r.

63

figure 3.7: family of solutions illustrating the progressive deformation of the vebrane
by the bundle of n fundamental strings. the dotted circle represents the horizon. the
stable conguration is a tube with r0  .

value of r. as   1 (i.e. as the starting radius gets closer and closer to the horizon),
the brane becomes more and more spherical (notice that r() = rh is a solution to the

equations of motion). for  > crit, on the other hand, the solution tilts away from the
symmetry axis, reaching  =  only at r = . as  increases the solution looks more
and more like a tube. this is simply a consequence of the fact that, for large , the

solution is always very far from the horizon, and is well-approximated by an extremal

embedding (discussed in [12]). when    the conguration becomes a bps tube
[12] with innite radius.

the cusp in the  < crit solutions indicates the presence of a delta-function source

in the equations of motion. since the compactly wrapped brane intercepts n units of

ve-form ux, it has n units of worldbrane u(1) charge and must have n fundamental

strings attached to it [44]. this is most simply achieved by taking the cusp as the

point of attachment of n fundamental strings, running along the ray  = .

in

accordance with the born-infeld string philosophy [6, 7], these strings are equivalent

to a d5-brane wrapped on an s4 of vanishing volume which carries the u(1) ux out

to innity. a simple modication of the at space argument [10, 6, 7] shows that

such a collapsed vebrane is a solution to the equations of motion and has tension

ntf f (r)1/2 (exactly the tension exerted by a fundamental string of intrinsic tension

tf in this curved space).

64

the entire vebrane-string (or collapsed brane) system will be stable only if there

is tension balance between its two components. to obtain the stability condition, let rc

denote the location of the cusp (which is a function of r0), and parametrize the family
of vebrane embeddings as r = r(; rc). under the variation rc  rc + rc, it can be
seen from (3.26), after an integration by parts and application of the euler-lagrange

equation, that the energy of the brane changes only by a surface term,

where rc = r|=, and we have used the fact that r(; rc) = rc. the numerator
in the last expression of (3.30) is the tension at r = rc of n fundamental strings,

so it is clear that the brane has a lower tension for any rc > rh. the energy is

lowered by expanding the vebrane and shortening the explicit fundamental string. a

similar variational calculation applied to the  > crit congurations (cut o at a large

r = rmax) shows that the bps tube at innity is the lowest energy solution. this

is consistent with the results of [46], where the baryon was examined using the pure

nambu-goto action for the vebrane wrapped on a sphere. we emphasize that the

above variational calculation used solutions of the full born-infeld (plus wess-zumino)

action.

altogether, then, the solutions depicted in fig. 3.7 provide a physically satisfying

picture of the process through which the n fundamental strings deform the initially

spherical vebrane, pulling it out to innity. the nal conguration has the shape of

a tube, just like the bps embeddings found in [29, 12]. in the supersymmetric case,

r0 was a modulus and the energy of the baryon was independent of the overall scale of

the solution. in the nonextremal case examined here, however, there appears to be a

potential for that modulus which drives the stable solution out to r0  .

the dependence of the vebrane embedding on the s5 coordinates encodes the

avor structure (i.e., the su(4) quantum numbers) of the gauge theory state under

65

consideration. as a result of the uv/ir relation, the ads radial coordinate r is

associated with an energy scale in the gauge theory, e = r/r2 [51, 52]. the embedding

r() consequently associates a particular value of  to each dierent distance scale,

yielding some sort of su(4) wavefunction for the baryon. the so(5) symmetry of

the embedding translates into the statement that the baryon is a singlet under the

corresponding su(4) subgroup. finally, the fact that a given surface spans the range

r  r0 implies that the dual gauge theory conguration has structure on all length
scales from zero up to a characteristic size r2/r0. since the energetically preferred
conguration has r0  , it is in this sense truly pointlike.

3.3.3 the split baryon: color dependence of the string ten-

sion

we now turn our attention to solutions with px 6= 0 (i.e. x
6= 0). they describe
collections of quarks at nite separation in the gauge theory position space and are of

interest for exploring connement issues. it turns out to be rather easy to construct a

surface describing an su(n) baryon split into two distinct groups, containing n and

(1  )n quarks respectively and separated by a distance l in the x direction. in a
conning su(n) gauge theory, two such quark bundles should be connected by a color

ux tube and we will study the born-infeld representation of this phenomenon. each

group of quarks corresponds as before to a bundle of born-infeld strings, realized in
our approach as a singular spike or vebrane tube with topology r  s4. remember
that we have assumed an so(5)-symmetric conguration, which means that the two

singularities representing the quarks must be located at opposite poles of the s5 (we

will put them at  = 0 and  = ) with corresponding implications about the su(4)

avor structure of the states we are constructing. more general avor structures are

possible, but we will not try to study these more complicated surfaces. for large spatial

separation l = |x()x()|, the portion of the vebrane that interpolates between

66

the two string bundles runs close to the horizon and it is this part of the surface that

encodes the conning ux tube of the gauge theory. the surface equations

(3.29)

imply that the part of the surface that has large spatial extent must sit at a constant

 = c where p = 0. more precisely, it has to sit at the solution of

 = c  sin c cos c .

(3.31)

corresponding to the unstable maximum of the potential v () discussed at the end

of section 3.3.1. the critical angle is a monotonic function of , such that c(0) = 0
and c() =   c(1  ). the energetics of the part of the vebrane that encodes
the conning ux tube will depend on c, and therefore , in a way that we will now

examine in some detail.

unfortunately, we must resort to numerical analysis to construct specic surfaces

of this kind. it is convenient to take the point of closest approach to the horizon as

the starting point for the numerical integration. we start the integration o with the

initial conditions

r(0) = rh +  , pr(0) = 0 ,
(0) = c ,
p(0) =  ,
x(0) = 0 ,

px(0) = (r(0)/r)2qsin6 c  (/r(0))2 .

(3.32)

the distance from the horizon at the point of closest approach is controlled by . for

a given , we have to shoot in  until we get satisfactory behavior of the quark-like

singularities at   0 and    (see section 3.3.2 for details). indeed, it is natural
to require asymptotically bps behavior in the region of space where supersymmetry is

recovered locally (i.e., far from the horizon). once that is done,  controls the spatial

separation of the two separated quark bundles. figs. 3.8 and 3.9 depict a typical

vebrane embedding obtained by numerical integration, for the case  = 0.9 . it can

be seen in fig. 3.8 that the brane extends in the x direction mostly in its ux tube

portion, at  = c and r  rh. the born-infeld string tubes corresponding to the two
groups of quarks lie essentially at a constant value of x.

figure 3.8: the three-dimensional projection of the d5-brane. every point on the curve
is an s4. one can clearly see how the brane drops down towards the horizon, extends
horizontally along it, and nally leaves at the other end. from the point of view of
the three-dimensional su(n) gauge theory, which lives in the {x, y, z} directions, this
conguration represents a baryon split into two groups of n and (1)n quarks (the
vertical segments  see fig. 3.9), connected by a ux tube extending a nite distance
along the x direction.

it is seen from the equation for r in (3.29) that, for the portion of the brane running

close to the horizon, r(s)  rh grows as an exponential in the parameter s, with an
exponent proportional to pr. the latter reaches a value close to (r/rh)px (see the

equation for pr). the equation for x then shows that the separation l between the

quarks increases only logarithmically with , the minimal distance to the horizon. in

fact, there exists a limiting solution which consists of n quarks with a ux tube that

extends to innity, and the brane approaches the horizon exponentially with distance.

from the above discussion it is clear that for large quark separation l the (renor-

malized) energy will receive its main contribution from the ux tube, and will conse-

quently depend linearly on l, a clear indication of connement. it is easy to compute

the tension (energy per unit distance in x) of the color ux tube. note that when the

infeld string tubes pointing up and down represent two groups of n and (1  )n
quarks, respectively (with  = 0.9 here). the brane extends in the x-direction mostly
at the inection point (the cusp), while x is essentially constant along the tubes.

where the last expression is given solely in terms of parameters of the gauge theory in

notice that, in addition, equation (3.33) gives the dependence of the ux tube

from the factor sin3 c, is plotted in fig. 3.10:

figure 3.10: the tension of the ux tube (normalized to unity at its peak) as a function
of , the fraction of quarks pulled apart. in the full theory  should be quantized in
units of 1/n. see text for discussion.

let us discuss the features of the ux tube tension seen in fig. 3.10. as one

might expect, the tension increases linearly for small . this means that for each

additional quark removed the work done is approximately constant. also as expected,

in expression (3.33) there is a complete symmetry between  and 1  , (i.e., it makes
no dierence whether n or n  n quarks are pulled out). thus, the tension has a
in gauge theory
maximum at  = 1/2 and comes back down to zero near  = 1.

language, the at part of the curve means that it does not cost any energy to move

the quark from one bundle with  n/2 quarks to the other.

notice from equation (3.31) that sin3 c  3/2 for small . this implies that
3( = 1/n) becomes independent of n in the t hooft limit n   with 3 xed.
this result has a natural gauge theory interpretation. when one quark is pulled out

70

from the su(n) baryon (a color-singlet), the remaining n  1 must be in the anti-
fundamental representation of the gauge group. the ux tube extending between this

bundle and the solitary quark should then have the same properties as the standard

qcd string which connects a quark and an antiquark. in particular, its tension should

depend on n only through the t hooft coupling, as we have found. as a matter of

fact, for  = 1/n  1 equation (3.33) precisely agrees with the quark-antiquark string
tension which follows from a nambu-goto string calculation [47]. more generally, for

 = n/n, with n xed as n  , expression (3.33) reduces to the tension of n
quark-antiquark strings.

it is important to note that, as has been pointed out by various authors, the gauge

theory under study here is not strictly three-dimensional [47, 45]. the energy scale

associated with the qcd string tension, for instance, is proportional to 1/4

4 t , where

4 = g2

y m4n. this is much larger than the compactication scale t in the large 4

regime where the supergravity approximation is appropriate.

71

conclusion

in conclusion i would like to sum up what has been done in this thesis, and point

out some interesting possible extensions of our work.

in the second chapter i conclusively show the broad applicability of the born-infeld

action to static and dynamical questions in string theory.

in the third chapter i present the work done in collaboration with c. callan, a.

guijosa, and . tafjord on application of the b-i vebrane worldvolume action to the

ads/cft correspondence. we construct a non-perturbative object of gauge theory,

namely the baryon vertex.

our description of the hanany-witten phenomenon raises a very interesting ques-

tion which i would like to explore in the future, whether the half-string state that can

be conveniently described by our b-i wrapped brane has in fact reality to it, i.e. what

are the dynamical consequences of such an object, and its place in perturbative string

theory.

in the second part of the chapter i present our work on the supergravity/gauge

theory correspondence in the case of non-extremal background. here we were able

to measure the tension of the color ux tubes, and its dependence on the number of

quarks removed from the baryon to a nite distance.

the possible extension of these eorts to get a handle at weakly coupled non-

supersymmetric theory would be to the new ideas coming from type 0a and 0b theories

[56, 57, 58]. in these theories spacetime fermions are absent from the very beginning

and there is no need to invent ways to decouple them. moreover there are solutions to

the gravity equations which have a running dilaton, and on the gauge theory side the

running coupling matches exactly the expectation from ordinary qcd.

it is at present too early to comment on the validity of this approach, for example

because of the problems associated with the presence of the tachyon in the low energy

spectrum.
