abstract

we consider non perturbative eects in m-theory compactications on a seven-manifold

of g2 holonomy arising from membranes wrapped on supersymmetric three-cycles. when
membranes are wrapped on associative submanifolds they induce a superpotential that

can be calculated using calibrated geometry. this superpotential is also derived from

compactication on a seven-manifold, to four dimensional anti-de sitter spacetime, of

eleven dimensional supergravity with non vanishing expectation value of the four-form

eld strength.

1 introduction

the theory of minimal surfaces has been for a long time an area of active research in

mathematics. a deep novelty on it was the theory of calibrations, introduced by harvey

and lawson [1] in 1982. a calibration is a closed k-form  on a riemannian manifold

m such that its restriction to each tangent plane of m is less or equal to the volume

of the plane. submanifolds for which equality holds are said to be calibrated by , and

they have least volume in their homology class. with this dening property, minimal

p-surfaces, or calibrated submanifolds, can be naturally employed to construct supersym-

metric congurations of dirichlet pbranes in string theory, as in references [2]-[17], an

approach which is also probably able to shed some light [18, 19] on the study of the

moduli space of calibrated submanifolds [20, 21], whose global structure seems dicult to

understand [22, 23].

motivated by reference [15], where bps solitons in the eective eld theory arising

from compactication of type iia string theory, with non vanishing ramond-ramond

uxes, on a calabi-yau fourfold, were identied by gukov with d-branes wrapped over

calibrated submanifolds in the internal calabi-yau space to provide a simple and geomet-

rical derivation of the superpotential in the two dimensional eld theory [24, 25], in this

paper we will consider compactication of m-theory on a seven-manifold of g2 holonomy,
which leads to a four dimensional eld theory with n = 1 supersymmetry, and apply

ideas, as in [15], of the theory of calibrations to understand the superpotential.

superpotentials induced by membrane instantons in m-theory on a seven-manifold

have been previously considered from the point of view of geometric engineering of eld

theories by acharya in [26], where fractional membrane instantons, arising from com-

pactication on joyce orbifolds, are argued to generate a superpotential and, more re-

cently, by harvey and moore in [14], where membranes wrapped on rigid supersymmetric

three-cycles are shown to induce non zero corrections to the superpotential, that can be

expressed in terms of topological invariants of the three-cycle. in this paper we will ar-

gue how the allowed calibrations in g2 holonomy seven-manifolds imply that the only
contributions to the superpotential in the four dimensional eld theory will come from

membranes whose worldvolume has been wrapped on supersymmetric three-cycles of the

internal manifold, and exclude posible corrections from eleven dimensional vebranes, in

the same way as in [15] various d-branes in type iia string theory are shown to contribute

1

to the superpotential in the two dimensional n = (2, 2) eld theory, when wrapping cali-

brated submanifolds in the calabi-yau fourfold. however, we will not consider compact-

ications to four dimensional minkowski spacetime, as in [14], but to four dimensional

anti-de sitter space, to avoid the constraint that the fourth rank tensor eld strength

must be vanishing [27]. this will allow a nice geometrical picture for the superpotential.

relevant notions on calibrated geometries, and its realizations in supersymmetric com-

pactications, are described in section 2. section 3 is devoted to the construction of the

superpotential induced by membrane instantons, identifying instantons in the four di-

mensional eld theory with membranes whose worldvolume is wrapped over associative

submanifolds in the g2 holonomy seven-manifold. the expression for the superpotential
is justied in section 4 by compactication of eleven dimensional supergravity, with non

trivial fourth rank tensor eld strength, on a manifold with g2 holonomy to a four di-
mensional anti-de sitter spacetime. in section 5 we present some concluding remarks and

possible implications of the work presented here.

2 supersymmetry and the calibration bound

in this section we will review some generalities about calibrated geometry1, and its relation
to supersymmetric compactications, and introduce some results and denitions relevant

to the rest of the paper.

given a riemannian manifold m, with metric g, an oriented tangent k-plane v on m

is a vector subspace v of the tangent space tpm to m, with dim (v ) = k, equipped with
an orientation. the restriction g|v is the euclidean metric on v , and allows to dene,
together with the orientation on v , a natural volume form volv on the tangent space v .
a closed k-form  is said to be a calibration on m if for every oriented k-plane v on

m it is satised

where, by |v , we mean

|v  volv

|v =  . volv

(2.1)

reference [1], or [28] for a collection of results.

for some   r, so that condition (2.1) holds only if   1.

now let n be an oriented submanifold of m, with dimension k, so that each tangent
space tpn, for p  n, is an oriented tangent k-plane. the submanifold n is called a
calibrated submanifold with respect to the calibration  if

|tpn = voltpn

(2.3)

for all p  n. it is easy to show that calibrated manifolds have minimal area in their
homology class [1]; to see this, let us denote by [] the de rham cohomology class,
[]  h k(m; r), and by [n] the homology class, [n]  hk(m; r). then,

(2.4)

(2.5)

[] . [n] = zpn

|tpn .

but condition (2.1) implies

zpn

|tpn  zpn

voltpn = vol(n),

so that vol(n)  [] . [n]. equality holds for calibrated submanifolds [1].

in this paper we will be interested in calibrated geometries in seven-dimensional joyce

manifolds with g2 holonomy so that m, in what follows, will be a compact seven-manifold,
m = x7, with a torsion free structure, that we will denote by (3) (the holonomy group
of the metric associated to (3) is g2 if and only if 1(x7) is nite [29]).

the covariantly constant three-form (3) constitutes the associative calibration, with
respect to the set of all associative three-planes, which are the canonically oriented imagi-
nary part of any quaternion subalgebra of o. calibrated submanifolds with respect to (3)
will, in what follows, be denoted by s, and referred to as associative submanifolds. the
hodge dual to the associative calibration is a four-form (4), known as the coassociative
calibration, responsible for coassociative submanifolds.

the existence of associative submanifolds, volume minimizing, can be directly un-

derstood from the point of view of compactications of m-theory on manifolds with g2
holonomy [3]. let us see how this comes about. the low energy limit of m-theory is ex-

pected to be eleven dimensional supergravity, which is a theory that contains membrane
solutions, described by the action [30, 31] 2

where x m (i) represents the membrane conguration,  is an eleven dimensional dirac
spinor and h is the induced metric on the worldvolume of the membrane (upper case
latin indices are dened in eleven dimensions, while greek indices , ,  label coordinates

on the worldvolume).

on the membrane elds, global fermionic symmetries act as

 = ,

x m = im ,

(2.7)

where  is an eleven dimensional constant anticonmuting spinor. but the theory is also

invariant under local fermionic transformations,

x m = 2im p+(),

(2.8)

with  some eleven dimensional spinor, and p+ a projection operator [32]; the operators
p are dened as

p =

(2.9)

and can be easily shown to satisfy p 2

 = p, p+p = 0 and p+ + p = 1.

as bosonic membrane congurations break all the global supersymmetries generated

by , unbroken supersymmetry remains only if there is a spinor () such that

or, equivalently,

 +  = 2p+() +  = 0

p[2p+() + ] = p = 0.

(2.10)

(2.11)

if the eleven dimensional theory is compactied on a seven-manifold of g2 holonomy,
nding a covariantly constant spinor  satisfying condition (2.11) is equivalent to the

existence of a supersymmetric three-cycle in the seven-manifold, which is precisely the

4

associative submanifold [3]. to prove this, we will formally write the covariantly constant

three-form (the associative calibration) as

(3) =

1
3 !

mnpdx m  dx n  dx p,

(2.12)

and decompose the eleven dimensional spinor  in terms of a four dimensional spinor, ,

and the covariantly constant spinor  on the manifold with g2 holonomy (this spinor is
unique up to scale),

now, if we chose a normalization such that the action of the seven dimensional gamma

matrices on the covariantly constant spinor of the internal manifold is

 =   .

(2.13)

mnp  = mnp ,

the condition (2.11) for unbroken supersymmetry becomes

[x mx n]x pmnp = ,

(2.14)

(2.15)

(2.16)

so that the pull back of the three-form is proportional to the volume element 3.

condition (2.16) implies that the membrane worldvolume, wrapped on the three-cycle

calibrated by (3), has been minimized, as can be easily seen from the inequality

z d3h(p)(p)  0,

(2.17)

as in [2]. using the projector (2.9), and the fact that p 

p = p, (2.17) becomes

3 associative calibrations and superpotential for m-

theory compactications

m-theory compactication on a seven-manifold with g2 holonomy produces a four dimen-
sional eld theory with n = 1 supersymmetry. at low energy, trusting eleven dimensional

supergravity as an aproximation to m-theory, the eective four dimensional supergravity

theory describing the massless modes is n = 1 supergravity coupled to b2 vector multi-
plets, and b3 chiral multiplets, where b2 and b3 are betti numbers of x7 [33]. however,
in this paper we will not be interested in this relatively poor, from the point of view of

physics, spectrum, or posible increases of interest when singularities are allowed in the

seven-manifold, as in [26]. what we will wonder about is the generation of a non pertur-

bative superpotential, arising in the eective four dimensional eld theory from m-theory

eects, applying the ideas in [15].

in reference [15], the generation of a superpotential in the two dimensional theories ob-

tained when compactifying type iia string theory on calabi-yau fourfold with background

ramond-ramond uxes was considered, identifying bps solitons in the eld theory with

d-branes wrapped over calibrated submanifolds in the internal manifold. in this section,

following the same reasoning, we will wrap the m-theory membrane worldvolume over
some associative submanifold in the seven-manifold x7, s  h3(x7, z), which is a su-
persymmetric three-cycle, dened through condition (2.16). this state, from the point

of view of the four dimensional eld theory, is an instanton. the ux of the fourth-rank

antisymmetric eld strength, f = dc, associated to the membrane, over the comple-
ment (s) in x7, which will be some four dimensional manifold, y4, jumps by one when
crossing the membrane. to understand this, two points p and q can be chosen to ly at

each side of the three-cycle s, with the membrane worldvolume wrapped on it. if t is
a path joining these two points, and it is chosen to intersect the membrane at a single
point, the ve-manifold y4  t will also intersect the membrane at a single point. now,
as df

2 is a delta function for the membrane,

(3.2)

hence, the eld theory vacua connected by the instanton solution will correspond to dif-
ferent four-form uxes, f1 and f2; the variation f
2 is then poincare dual to the homology
class of the supersymmetric three-cycle, [s]. but the amplitude for the conguration of
the membrane is proportional to the volume of the associative submanifold, s,

zs

(3),

(3.3)

the constant of proportionality being simply the membrane tension.

if we denote the

superpotential in the eld theory by w , the amplitude of the instanton connecting two

vacua will be given by the absolute value of w ; then, when (3.2) is taken into account,

(3.3) becomes

w = zs

(3) =

1

2 zx7=sy4

(3)  f (4),

so that we expect a superpotential

w =

1

2 zx7

(3)  f (4),

(3.4)

(3.5)

for compactication of m-theory on a seven-manifold of g2 holonomy. expression (3.5)
is the analogous of the untwisted and twisted chiral superpotentials obtained in [15] for

compactication of type iia string theory in a calabi-yau fourfold with non-vanishing

ramond-ramond uxes.

we could now also wonder about the possible contribution of m-theory vebranes to

the superpotential. in fact, the result that 1(x7) is nite if and only if the holonomy is
in g2 [29], implies that h6(x7; z) is also nite, so that we might expect instanton eects
coming from the vebrane. however, there is no six dimensional calibrated submanifold
in x7, because the only calibrations are (3) and (4), so that there will be no bps
vebrane instanton contribution to the superpotential.

4 eleven dimensional supergravity

on seven-manifolds

in this section we will present evidence for the superpotential (3.5) from supersymmet-
ric compactication of m-theory on ads4  x7. compactication of eleven dimensional
supergravity on a seven-manifold is very restrictive, because the four dimensional non

compact spacetime is a supersymmetric minkowski space only if all components of the

fourth rank antisymmetric eld strength vanish, f = 0, and the internal manifold is ricci-

at [27]. however, if some of these conditions are relaxed, more general compactications

can be performed.

in [34, 35], compactication of eleven dimensional supergravity to

four dimensional anti-de sitter spacetime was shown to allow a four-form eld strength

proportional to the cosmological constant of the external space, and which therefore van-

ishes for compactications to minkowski spacetime. the requirements on the four-form

f , assuming that supersymmetry remains unbroken, with zero cosmological constant, for

compactication of m-theory with a warp factor on a calabi-yau fourfold have been ob-

tained in [36], and extended to a three dimensional anti-de sitter external space in [25].

the analysis of this section, where compactication of m-theory to a four dimensional

spacetime, with non vanishing cosmological constant, on an internal manifold with g2
holonomy will be considered, will hence follow closely those in references [36, 25, 15].

zero background uxes are allowed, and/or strings or membranes are introduced lling, respectively, two
or three dimensional spacetime, for compactication of string theory or m-theory. these strings, or
membranes, are represented by maximally symmetric tensor elds. however, for seven-manifolds there
is no such interpretation for the ansatz of the rst equation in (4.8).

now, if we decompose the eleven dimensional spinor  as   , with  chosen to be
the covariantly constant spinor on the seven-manifold of g2 holonomy, and we use the
fact that the associative calibration (3) satises relation (2.14), pqr = pqr, then the
components of (4.14) reproduce, when integrated over the volume of x7, the form of the
superpotential proposed in (3.5), with a coecient related to the warp factor, depending

hence on the internal dimensions, as a consequence of the ansatz (4.8), and with the

cosmological constant  identied with the vacuum value of the superpotential, w , in

the same way as the mass, and the twisted mass, are identied in [15] with the vacuum
values of w and w . note however the appearance of the chirality operator in expression
(4.14).

5 conclusions

in this paper we have investigated the generation of a non perturbative superpotential in

the four dimensional eld theories obtained from compactication of m-theory on a seven-

manifold with g2 holonomy. the allowed calibrations in these manifolds imply that the
only bps instantons are those obtained wrapping the worldvolume of the m-theory mem-

brane over associative submanifolds, which are the analogous of special lagrangian cycles

in calabi-yau manifolds, while instantons coming from vebranes wrapping six-cycles in

the seven-manifold are not bps states. an analysis relying on calibrated submanifolds

can also be used to study compactication of m-theory on a calabi-yau fourfold, where

vebranes wrapped over (complex) codimension one divisors d are however known to

contribute to the superpotential in the three dimensional eld theory arising upon com-

pactication of m-theory on the fourfold if the divisor satises the topological requirement
that (od, d) = 1 [43]. this precise condition can probably be related to the fact that
fourfolds with su(4) holonomy admit, besides from cayley calibrations, what are known

as kahler calibrations, which are obtained when considering powers of the complexied

kahler form,

 =

1
p !kp,

(5.1)

because the fact that k is covariantly constant ensures that , as dened in (4.13), is
also covariantly constant. submanifolds calibrated by  are complex submanifolds, of

11

dimension p, so that vebranes will become bps instantons once they are wrapped over
some (complex) three dimensional manifold, calibrated by 1

in reference [23], singularities of special lagrangian three-cycles, and their compactness

properties, were studied in detail, and a topological invariant, counting special lagrangian

homology three-spheres, was proposed. if an equivalent analysis can be repeated on seven-

manifolds with g2 holonomy, then an analogous topological invariant can probably be
constructed, counting associative submanifolds or, which is more interesting physically,

counting the number of membranes, or instantons, in the homology class [s], an idea
closely related to the gromov-witten invariants, counting pseudo-holomorphic curves in

symplectic manifolds. we hope to address this study in a subsequent paper.
