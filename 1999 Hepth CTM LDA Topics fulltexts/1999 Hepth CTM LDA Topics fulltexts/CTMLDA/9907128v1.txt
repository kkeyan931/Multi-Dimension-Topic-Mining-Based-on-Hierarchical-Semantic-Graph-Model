abstract

we study a conguration in matrix theory carying longitudinal vebrane charge,
i.e. a d0-d4 bound state. we calculate the one-loop eective potential between
a d0-d4 bound state and a d0anti-d4 bound state and compare our results
to a supergravity calculation. next, we identify the tachyonic uctuations in
the d0-d4 and d0anti-d4 system. we analyse classically the action for these
tachyons and nd solutions to the equations of motion corresponding to tachyon
condensation.

1. introduction

matrix theory [1] [2] [3] is the m-theory interpretation of u(n) supersymmetric
quantum mechanics which has passed many stringent tests. the brane content of
matrix theory was determined in [4]. amongst other branes, the longitudinal ve-
brane was identied 3. two types of representation for the longitudinal vebrane
were proposed. one in terms of an instanton gauge eld, which was used in [8] to
calculate one loop eective potentials between the d0-d4 bound state and other ob-
jects in matrix theory. another representation was proposed in terms of two pairs
of canonical conjugate variables. we use this representation to calculate one-loop
eective potentials (see e.g. [6] [7] [8] [9]) between this object and a graviton, another
d0-d4 bound, and a d0anti-d4 system. naturally, we nd agreement with [8] for
the cases studied there and with an extra supergravity calculation for the d0-d4 and
d0-anti-d4 system.

in [10] a rst step towards the understanding of sens tachyon condensation mech-
anism [11] in matrix theory was taken, by analyzing the tachyon in the d0-d2 and
d0anti-d2 system. we concentrate on the d0-d4 and d0anti-d4 system. we iden-
tify the tachyonic uctuations in the d0-d4 and d0anti-d4 background and analyse
the classical action for these uctuations in the spirit of [10]. we nd solutions to the
action representing condensation to a vacuum lled with d0-branes and gravitons.

the rst section concentrates on a discussion of the classical solution of matrix
theory corresponding to a d0-d4 bound state system. in the second section some
eective potentials are calculated in detail to get acquainted with the representation of
the longitudinal vebrane in terms of canonical conjugate variables. we add a remark
about the spectrum of the uctuations around one longitudinal vebrane. the next
section deals with an analysis of the tachyonic uctuations. then we analyse possible
solutions to the action for the tachyonic uctuations. finally, we add remarks on the
results and open problems.

2. preliminary discussion of the classical solution

the lagrangian of matrix theory is given by u(n) supersymmetric quantum me-
chanics, namely the dimensional reduction of tendimensional n = 1 u(n) super
yang-mills theory to 0 + 1 dimensions. it reads [1]:

t0
2

l =

t r(cid:18)(d0xi)2 +

1
[xi , xj ]2 + 2t d0  2t i [, xi](cid:19)
2
2
where we take 2 = 1 and t0 =
g . furthermore we have d0 = t  i [a0, .] and
i = 1, 2, . . . , 9. all elds are in the adjoint of u(n). the fermions are majorana-
weyl. the equations of motion for static congurations with trivial a0 and vanishing
fermions are:

(2.1)

we study especially a background conguration (xi = bi) corresponding to a d0-d4
bound state, or longitudinal vebrane, satisfying the following commutation rules [4]:

[xi , [xi , xj ]] = 0.

(2.2)

3the transverse vebrane remained a puzzle [5].

[b1, b2] = ic 3  i n

2  n

2

2

[b3, b4] = ic 3  i n

2  n

2

,

(2.3)

and the other matrices and commutators zero. here 3 is the third pauli matrix and c
is a constant. we take the innite background matrices to be blockdiagonal such that
this conguration solves the equations of motion. we will use two representations for
this solution. the rst one is in terms of two canonical conjugate pairs:

[p1, q1] = ic
[p2, q2] = ic
b1 =   p1
b2 =   q1
b3 =   p2
b4 =   q2

0

0

0 p1 !
0 q1 !
0 p2 !
0 q2 !

0

0

(2.4)

this representation makes it easy to interpret the brane content of the congu-
ration. clearly, this solution as a whole carries no membrane charge since q2 =
 i
2 t r [bi , bj ] = 0. it carries longitudinal vebrane charge in the 1, 2, 3, 4 directions
though:

q5 = 

1
82

ijklt r [bi bj bk bl] = n

c2
42

(2.5)

we refer to [14] for a clear and detailed analysis of the charges of the conguration,
which yields the fact that the conguration you build in this way represents at least
two d0-d4 bound states. that can be understood from the following reasoning.
when we focus on the left upper block, it clearly has membrane charge in directions
1, 2 and 3, 4, as well as longitudinal vebrane charge. it represents a d0-d4-d2-d2
bound state. zooming in on the right lower block we see a d0-d4-anti-d2-anti-d2
bound state.
if we formally superimpose the two parts we nd two d0-d4 bound
states, the 2-brane charge cancelling out.

thinking naively, one might be worried that this superposition is unstable, in
particular, one might expect a tachyonic o-diagonal mode in the background cong-
uration, representing a string stretching between a d2-brane and an anti-d2-brane.
we will come back to this point and show that there is no such tachyonic mode. more-
over, the conguration was shown in [4] to preserve 1/4 supersymmetry, as expected
from d0-d4 bound states.

an alternative representation of the background conguration in terms of gauge

elds, discussed in detail in [14] will come in handy later on. it is given by:

b1 = c  ix1
b2 = c  ix2 + x1

0

0

c

0

ix1 !

0

c !
ix2  x1

3

b3 = c  ix3
b4 = c  ix4 + x3

0

0

c

0

ix3 !

0

c !
ix4  x3

(2.6)

note that we introduce the same four coordinates on the two d0-d4 bound states.
this indicates our intention of treating them as a single object. indeed, we will only
analyse interaction potentials and uctuations where the two d0-d4 bound states
move as one. we dene the left-upper and the right-lower part to be made up of n0
2
d0-branes and denote the d0-brane charge density as 0 = n0
, where a4 represents
2a4
the (possibly innite) area of the coinciding d4-d0 bound states. then we can derive
the following relation [14] :

c2 =

a4n4
(2)2n0

(2.7)

where n4 is the number of fourbranes and n0 the total number of d0-branes in the
bound state.

3. calculating eective potentials in matrix theory at one loop 4

in the literature (e.g.

in this section we calculate some interaction potentials between the d0-d4 bound
state 5 and other objects explicitly.
[6] [7] [8] [9]), some of
these potentials have already been calculated using the representation in terms of an
instanton background gauge eld [8]. but in the next section we will need a more
detailed analysis of the uctuations, when we identify the tachyonic ones. moreover
there are a few new technicalities in calculating the spectrum of the uctuations when
a single object is represented by two-by-two matrices, which have not been discussed
in the literature yet. therefore we nd it useful to rst redo some of the calculations
in the literature in our representation, next to treat the new case of the d0-d4 and
d0anti-d4 interaction in detail.

because one object is sometimes represented by two-by-two matrices, we need
some new conventions and nomenclature, which we will take to be as follows. in this
section, the rst object will have extent n0, the second object n0. when one object
is represented by a two-by-two matrix, the submatrices will have half the extent
of the object, e.g. n0
2 . moreover, suppose we have two objects in the background
represented by blockdiagonal two-by-two matrices. then we will take the following
nomenclature for the dierent parts of the coordinate matrices:

xi = 


block (1)

0

sector 13 sector 14
sector 23 sector 24

0

sector 13
sector 14

block (2)
sector 23 block (3)
sector 24

0

0

block (4)




(3.1)

4 readers only interested in the tachyonic uctuations can skip this section without much di-

culty.

5we will stop mentioning that it actually consist of two d0-d4 bound states from now on.

4

the o-diagonal modes have been divided up into four dierent sectors. other cases
to be discussed are simpler and the nomenclature will be analogous in an obvious
way.

the technique to calculate the one-loop eective potential between two objects in
matrix theory is standard by now [6] [7]. to calculate the potential, we determine
the spectrum of the o-diagonal uctuations corresponding to strings stretching from
one object to the other. their mass matrix is easily determined by expanding the ac-
tion of matrix theory around the relevant background. this is slightly more involved
when objects are represented by two-by-two matrices, but the general formulae in
for instance [8] [12] can easily be adapted to our case, essentially because the back-
ground matrices are block diagonal. we do not give the details of the calculation,
but summarize for each case the result.

in the following three subsections, we will discuss three dierent cases. for the
rst object we always take the d0-d4 bound state. for the second object we take
respectively a graviton, a d0-d4 bound state, or a d0anti-d4 bound state. the
second object will always be taken to be at a distance b of the rst object in some
transverse direction (8) and it will be moving with a velocity v relative to the rst
object in another transverse direction (9). this is incorporated by choosing the
background matrices corresponding to these transverse coordinates to be:

b8 =   0n0n0
b9 =   0n0n0

0

0

0

b in0n0 !
vt in0n0 !

0

(3.2)

finally, to make the interaction energies nite, we wrap the fourbranes on a four-
torus. this hardly inuences the calculation. it is moreover convenient to take the
four-torus to have self-dual radii ri = . it is straightforward to again add in the
dependence on the compactication radii in the nal formulae. see for instance [8].

3.1. interaction potential between a d0-d4 bound state system and a graviton

for the rst case, namely the d0-d4 bound state interacting with a moving gravi-
ton, the non-trivial background matrices are (recall also the separation matrices b8
and b9 given in (3.2)):

(3.3)

for the quantum uctuations we nd identical spectra 6 in the two sectors of extent
n0
2  n0. we dene the hamiltonian:
1 + q2

2 + b2 + v2t2,

h = p 2

2 + q2

1 + p 2

(3.4)

corresponding to two non-interacting harmonic oscillators with frequency c and a
trivial extra part. after diagonalization, we nd for the mass operators of the real
bosons 4 : h  2iv; 8 : h  2c; 4 : h and for the fermions 8 : h  iv; 8 : h  2c  iv,
where we always state the number of elds rst, and then the mass operator that
corresponds to them. for instance 4 : h  2c corresponds to 2 elds with mass
operator h + 2c and 2 elds with mass operator h  2c. the spectrum of these mass
operators is easily determined. following [6] [7] it is then straightforward to calculate
the phase shift due to the interactions, and to approximate the phase shift at large
distances b2  c and small velocities v  b2:

we denoted the degeneracy of the energy levels by n which in this case is given by:
(3.7)

n0

n = c2 n0

2

c2 =

n0

(3.8)

and we have used formula (2.7) at self-dual radii (a4 = (2)2). determining the
degeneracy of the spectrum has been done for the equivalent problem in the landau
model  a charged particle in a magnetic eld. the degeneracy for the landau levels
was determined in [13]. translating the formula for the degeneracy to our problem
and carefully keeping track of normalization factors, we nd the following heuristic
for the degeneracy in general:

n = dimension uctuation-matrix 

product of frequencies of the harmonic oscillators in h.

(3.9)
(3.10)

this rule is applied in (3.7), n0n0
2 being the dimension of the uctuations and c2 being
the product of the harmonic oscillator frequencies in h (3.4). the end result for the
phase shift matches with the supergravity calculation in the relevant regime (a.1),

6some boson contributions to the one loop eective potential are cancelled by ghost contributions.

we dont include them in the following.

and with the result obtained in a dierent manner in [8]. the phase shift starts at
order v because the background conguration preserves 1

4 supersymmetry.

3.2. d0-d4 and d0-d4 interaction

in the second case the background matrices are:

[p1, q1] = ic1
[p2, q2] = ic1

(3.11)

here we nd four sectors of extent n0
(13) = (24) and sector (23) = (14). we dene the two relevant hamiltonians

2 , two by two identical, namely sector

h (13) = (p1 + p3)2 + (q1  q3)2 + (p2 + p4)2 + (q2  q4)2 + b2 + v2t2
h (23) = (p1 + p3)2 + (q1 + q3)2 + (p2 + p4)2 + (q2 + q4)2 + b2 + v2t2.

each describes a system of two decoupled harmonic oscillators. the diagonalized
mass operators are: in sector (13) for the bosons 4 : h  2iv; 8 : h  2(c1  c3); 2 : h
and for the fermions 8 : h  iv; 8 : h  iv  2(c1  c3). in sector (23) they read for
the bosons 4 : h  2iv; 8 : h  2(c1 + c3); 4 : h and for the fermions 8 : h  iv;
8 : h  iv  2(c1 + c3). the spectrum is again easily determined, and the phase shift
now gets two dierent contributions:

the fact that the phase shift starts at order v is due to the fact that the background
conguration preserves 1/4 supersymmetry. the endresult matches with the super-
gravity calculation (a.2) [8].

note the partial sign change in the rst background matrix, turning the second object
into a d0anti-d4 bound state. we nd four sectors of extent n0
2 , all with
identical spectra, when we ignore the origin in terms of the dierent coordinates 7.
the relevant hamiltonian is:

2  n0

h (13) = (p1  p3)2 + (q1  q3)2 + (p2 + p4)2 + (q2  q4)2 + b2 + v2t2,

corresponding to a system of two harmonic oscillators. we will always suppose that
c1  c3 is positive, the other case being fully equivalent. the mass operators are for
each sector for the bosons 4 : h  2iv; 4 : h  2(c1 + c3); 4 : h  2(c1  c3); 4 : h
and for the fermions 16 : h  iv  (c1 + c3)  (c1  c3). the potential is then :

(3.23)

compared to the previous case (3.16), there is an extra interaction between the d4-
brane and the anti-d4-brane. the interaction potential is non-trivial at zero velocity
and the background fully breaks supersymmetry. the end result is reproduced by our
supergravity calculation (a.3) in the appendix. clearly, the formula for the potential
breaks down at small distances b2  2c3. then there is a tachyon in the spectrum of
the bosons since the lowest energy mode has mass: e = (c1  c3) + (c1 + c3) + b2 
2(c1 + c3) = b2  2c3. we will treat the system at short distances in section 5.

3.4. summary

the conclusions we draw from these calculations are the following. at the level
we are probing the system, the representation of the d0-d4 system that we use is
equivalent to the instanton gauge eld representation used in [8]. we found full
agreement when we compared the long range one loop potentials with supergravity
results, also for the case of the d0-d4 and the d0anti-d4 system, as expected.
moreover, we showed that it makes perfect sense to divide the o-diagonal modes
into dierent sectors and treat them separately, which will be important in the second
part of our paper.

4. remark on the uctuations around one longitudinal vebrane

we refer to [14] for an analysis of the eective action for the uctuations around the
d0-d4 bound state system, but we add a remark that ts well into the context of our

7we can do so for calculating the eective potential, but in section 5 we need the precise origin

of the tachyonic modes in terms of the coordinate matrices. we return there to this point.

9

paper. as we mentioned in section 2, you might expect a tachyonic o-diagonal mode
in the coordinate matrices spanning the vebranes (2.4), since they could correspond
to strings stretching from a d2-brane to an anti-d2-brane. that this does not happen
is shown by a small calculation. the relevant mass matrix for these modes is, for
instance for the uctuations in the coordinates x1 and x2:

m12 =   h 2ic
2ic h !

where

h = p 2

1 + q2

1 + p 2

2 + q2
2.

(4.1)

(4.2)

diagonalizing the mass matrix and determing the spectrum yields two kinds of uc-
tuations with the following energies:

e = c(2n + 1) + c(2m + 1) + 2c
e = c(2n + 1) + c(2m + 1)  2c

(4.3)
(4.4)

note that for the last kind of uctuation, we nd a massless mode, and not a tachyonic
one. this is due to the quantummechanical zero point energies coming from the object
spanning in the 1,2 as well as the 3,4 direction. for a membraneanti-membrane
system this mode would be tachyonic [6] [10].

5. the action for the tachyonic uctuations

5.1. the tachyonic uctuations

from now on, we will consider the d0-d4 system and the d0anti-d4 system
to lie on top of each other, so we put the background matrices b8 and b9 (3.2) to
zero. then, when we compute the mass matrix for the uctuations in the coordinate
matrices x1 and x2, we nd the following matrix for sector 13:

m (13)

12

=   h (13)

2i(c1 + c3)

2i(c1 + c3)

h (13)

!

(5.1)

where

h (13) = (p1  p3)2 + (q1  q3)2 + (p2 + p4)2 + (q2  q4)2.

(5.2)

we diagonalize the mass matrix and determine the spectrum for the diagonal uctu-
ations 8:

e = (c1 + c3)(2n + 1) + (c1  c3)(2m + 1) + 2(c1 + c3)
e = (c1 + c3)(2n + 1) + (c1  c3)(2m + 1)  2(c1 + c3)

8recall that we chose c1  c3.

(5.3)
(5.4)

10

from the second line, we nd a tachyonic mode, as expected, with mass 2c3. note
that for c1 < 2c3 you nd several tachyonic modes. when you follow the simple
diagonalization procedure in detail, you nd that the tachyonic uctuation 9 is:

 =

y(13)
2  iy(13)
12

(5.5)

where y(mn)
uctuation

i

denotes the uctuation in sector (mn) and coordinate matrix xi. the

 =

2 + iy(13)
y(13)
12

(5.6)

corresponds to (5.3) and is never tachyonic. in the other sectors the computation goes
analogously for a total of four tachyonic elds that correspond to strings stretching
between the two d4 branes and the two anti-d4 branes (in the presence of the d0-
branes). they are given by:

 =

 =

 =

 =

y(13)
2  iy(13)
12
y(24)
2 + iy(24)
12
y(14)
4  iy(14)
32
y(23)
4 + iy(23)
32

(5.7)

5.2. the action

next we turn to the analysis of the action for the tachyonic uctuations in the
spirit of [10]. we expand the classical action around the d0-d4 and d0anti-d4
background, only keeping track of the tachyonic uctuations and the gauge elds of
the unbroken gauge group u(1)4 under which the tachyons are charged. all elds we
believe to be irrelevant, we put to zero, for instance (5.6). for simplicity, we take
the number of d0-d4 bound states and d0-anti-d4 bound states to be equal, i.e.
c1 = c3 = c. now the second representation introduced in section 2 comes in handy.
under the preceding assumptions, the coordinate matrices are given by:

x 1 = c

and the rest zero. each tachyonic mode is charged under two of the abelian gauge
symmetries, with opposite charges, as can easily be seen by looking at the transfor-
mation properties of the full coordinate matrix.

to represent the action in terms of an integral over the worldvolume of the branes,
we use the rules of [4], improved in [14] and elaborated upon in [10]. we rally some
of the technical details to appendix b. the following denitions come in handy in
writing down the endresult. the non-center-of-mass coordinates are:

ui =

where all elds only depend on the non-center-of-mass coordinates. note that it is
the lagrangian you expect, with the usual kinetic terms for the gauge elds, the
appropriate covariant derivatives hitting the tachyons and a higgs potential for the
tachyons. there are some interactions between the tachyons and the gauge elds [10],
and an interaction potential between the dierent tachyons.

5.3. boundary conditions

taking the background gauge elds to live on a four-torus with radii rui, they satisfy
t hoofts twisted boundary conditions [17]. they read in direction u1 :

aui(ru1, u2, u3, u4) = iu1 ui1

u1 + u1aui(0, u2, u3, u4)1

u1

(5.14)

and analogous for the other directions, where ui are the transition functions. the
transition functions can be choosen to be:

u1 = exp [iu2

(5.15)

these boundary conditions are due to the presence of the background eld, i.e. due
to the magnetic eld made up of the d0-branes, representing the background objects.
for the full background matrix this implies:

bi(ru1, u2, u3, u4) = u1bi(0, u2, u3, u4)1
u1

(5.16)

and analogously for the other directions.

the boundary conditions for the tachyons that are trivial with respect to the

background can be read of from (5.16):

(u1 = r1) = (u1 = 0)e2iu2r1/c
(u1 = r1) = (u1 = 0)e2iu2r1/c
(u3 = r3) = (u3 = 0)e2iu4r3/c
(u3 = r3) = (u3 = 0)e2iu4r3/c

(5.17)

and the other background boundary conditions are trivial.

6. a solution to the equations of motion

14

first we look for a solution to the equations of motion where the total lagrangian
(5.11) vanishes and the background boundary conditions are satised. we make the
following ansatz:

 = (u1, u2)
 = (u3, u4).

(6.1)

then we nd we can take:

a(1)
u1,2 = a(2)
a(1)
u3,4 = a(2)
the remaining non-trivial equations are:

u1,2 = a(3)
u3,4 = a(3)

u1,2 = a(4)
u1,2
u3,4 = a(4)

(6.2)

(6.3)

under the assumption (6.1), we get two copies of the bogomolny equations. these
have been studied in the context of chern-simons theory in detail [18] [19] and we
only summarize some main features. we can nd magnetic soliton solutions to these
equations with the background boundary conditions (5.17). since the spatial world-
volume of the d4-brane is fourdimensional, and the tachyons have non-trivial winding
number around a circle at innity, the magnetic solitons are twodimensional. the
boundary conditions are treated in detail in [10]. using the solutions, we calculate
the d0-brane charge from the worldvolume action of the d4-branes:

n =

=

=

1

82 z d4u(cid:16)f (1)f (1) + f (2)f (2)  f (3)f (3)  f (4)f (4)(cid:17)
42 z d4uf (1,3)

f (1,4)

u3u4

u1u2

1

a4
c22

,

(6.4)

(6.5)

which is the original d0-brane charge. the d0 charge is concentrated at the intersec-
tions of the orthogonal twodimensional solitons. moreover, from (6.2) we nd that
the d2-brane charge cancels. this is consistent with the fact that we nd, from the
commutators (b.3) and (b.4), and the supersymmetry variations

 =

1

2 (cid:18)d0x i i +

1

2 hx i , x ji ij(cid:19)  + 

(6.6)

that the tachyon condensation restores all dynamical supersymmetry. we conclude
that the end products after tachyon condensation are the original d0-branes, and
extra gravitons as argued in [10].

15

7. remarks and conclusion

in the previous section, we considered tachyon condensation where the tachyons
had trivial boundary conditions relative to the background. we can consider more
general possibilities, where the tachyons satisfy dierent boundary conditions. in the
case of a membraneanti-membrane conguration, this amounts to the following. by
choosing the topological sector of the tachyon on the d2-brane anti-d2-brane to be
non-trivial, one can add or subtract d0-brane charge. after condensation, this gives
an arbitrary number of d0-branes. technically, this is a trivial extension of [10].
in particular, the approximate solution to the equations of motion in [10] remains
practically unchanged.
in the case of the d0-d4 and d0-anti-d4, we have more
possibilities. for instance, by changing the topological sectors of the four tachyons
simultaneously, we can modify the amount of d0-brane charge in the end product
in a fairly obvious manner (keeping the condition (6.1)). it is clear that for a more
general choice of topological sectors, the end product will have d2-brane charge. it
would be interesting to study such condensation in detail.

in this paper we have studied the interactions between a d0-d4 bound state
and a d0-anti-d4 bound state in matrix theory. first, we calculated the interaction
potential at large distances and succesfully compared the result to an equivalent
supergravity calculation. next, we looked at a coinciding d0-d4 and d0anti-d4
bound state system and identied the tachyonic uctuations. we derived the classical
action for these tachyonic uctuations and found solutions to the equations of motion
corresponding to tachyon condensation to d0-branes.

appendix

a. the probe-background calculation

the standard technique for calculating the interaction potential (or correspond-
ing phase shift) between two objects from the born-infeld action and supergravity
approach is the following. you treat one object as the background and take the cor-
responding solution of the supergravity equations of motion. next, you consider the
worldvolume action of the other object in this background and calculate the potential
it feels due to the background. this has been done for many situations in the litera-
ture (see for instance [8] [9]). we state the results of these calculations for comparison
with the results obtained for matrix theory in the body of the paper. we take the
conventions of [8] (2 = 1) and we work at self-dual radius (ri = ) for the
compactied directions. we moreover approximate the potential at large distances
and small relative velocities between the two objects. for the interaction between a
d0-brane bound state and a d0-d4 bound state we nd the following phase shift 
[8]:

 

1
2b2

n0(cid:20)n4v +

1
4

(n0 + 2n4)v3(cid:21) + o(

1
b5

, v5).

for the interaction between two d0-d4 bound states, we nd [8]:

 

1

2b2 (cid:20)(n0n4 + n0n4)v +

1
4

(n0n0 + n4n4 + 2n0n4 + 2n4n0)v3(cid:21)

+o(

, v5).

1
b5

(a.1)

(a.2)

for the interaction between a d0-d4 bound state and a d0-anti-d4 bound state we
generalize the calculation in [8], to nd the potential:

v 

1

4b3 (cid:20)4n4n4 + (n0n4 + n0n4)v2 +

+o(

, v6).

1
b6

1
4

(n0n0 + n4n4 + 2n0n4 + 2n0n4)v4(cid:21)

(a.3)

the results agree with the matrix theory calculation at large n0 and n0. note that

the results for potentials (or corresponding phase shifts ( = r dtv(qb2 + (vt)2)) in

matrix theory can also be compared directly to string theory calculations [7] [15] .

b. technical details

some of the technical details for determining the action (5.11) are assembled here.
we refer to [14] and [10] for the rules to convert matrices into functions and traces into
integrals. we only keep the relevant terms and consider static congurations only.
first we dene the non-center-of-mass coordinates  the center of mass coordinates
just describe overall movements of the system in which we are not interested :

ui =

xi + yi

2

.

17

(b.1)

using the denitions given in the body of the text (5.10), we can write down the
commutators of the coordinate elds relevant to the problem in a reasonably compact
form10:

 c

((1,3)

u2

+ i(1,3)

u1

x1x2  ic + i||2





ic2f (1)

ic2f (1)

hx 1, x 2i =


hx 3, x 4i =


hx 1, x 3i = 






the other relevant commutators are all analogous to the following one:

u1u3  1
ic2f (1)




2 (  )  c2(1,3)

 c2(2,3)

u1
ic2f (3)

u1u3



u3

u1

c2(1,4)

c2(2,4)

2 (  )
ic2f (4)
u1u3

u3

(b.4)

the commutators are antihermitian. we then simplify the action by concentrating
on the non-center-of-mass uctuations of the tachyon (compare [10]):

(xi, yi) = (ui)q(x1  y1)(x2  y2)(x3  y3)(x4  y4)
(xi, yi) = (ui)q(x1  y1)(x2  y2)(x3  y3)(x4  y4)

(b.5)

(b.6)

then the action reduces to (5.11), the integration running over four variables only.

10we leave out the factors of the zero brane density 0 to avoid cluttering the formulas even more.

they can easily be added in [14] [10]
