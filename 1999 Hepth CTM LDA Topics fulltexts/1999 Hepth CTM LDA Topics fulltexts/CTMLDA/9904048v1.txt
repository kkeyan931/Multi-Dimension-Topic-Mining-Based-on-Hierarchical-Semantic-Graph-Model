the abelian higgs model and the georgi-glashow model in 2 and 3 euclidean dimensions re-
spectively, support both nite size instantons and sphalerons. the instantons are the familiar
nielsenoleson vortices and the t hooftpolyakov monopole solutions respectively. we have
constructed the sphaleron solutions and calculated the chern-simons charges ncs for sphalerons
of both models and have constructed two types of noncontractible loops between topologically
distinct vacuua. in the 3 dimensional model, the sphaleron and the vacuua have zero magnetic
and electric ux while the congurations on the loops have non vanishing magnetic ux.

introduction

in the semiclassical treatment of quantum eld theories, instantons [1, 2, 3] play the impor-
tant role of providing the tunneling between topologically inequivalent vacuua in an essentially
nonperturbative framework. instantons are classical solutions to the euler-lagrange equations
with euclidean time, whence comes the tunneling interpretation. another, closely related mech-
anism for vacuum to vacuum transitions but now at nonzero temperature, is provided by the
(euclidean) static solutions of the eld equations called sphalerons [4]. in contrast to instan-
tons, sphalerons are unstable solutions and provide a classical rather than quantum (tunneling)
transition over the energy barrier separating the two vaccua. in this context it is very useful
to consider another class of classical solutions, which are periodic in (euclidean) time, with the
period being identied with the inverse of the temperature. these are the periodic instantons
as dened in ref. [6]. thus at zero temperature the period of the periodic instanton becomes
innite, rendering it non-periodic, which can be identied as the instanton itself.

now a given eld theoretic model supporting sphalerons [4, 5] and hence also periodic instan-
tons [6], may or may not support (zerotemperature or innite period) instanton. in the case
where a nitesize instanton exists, it can be arrived at as the period of the periodic instanton
tends to innity. in the case however where no nite size instanton exists, the situation is more
complicated and the socalled constrained instantons [7] must be employed. the consequences
of a theory being of one type or the other are thought to be potentially important.

there has been some exploratory work done in this direction, in the context of the 1 + 1
dimensional scalebreaking o(3) sigma model [8] which does not support nite size instantons,
and its skyrmed version [9] which does so. the study of the periodic instantons in these two
models from this viewpoint was carried out in refs. [10, 11] respectively.

in view of the above, it is interesting to construct and study models that can support both
instantons and sphalerons, as a rst step before studying the periodic instantons interpolating
them. our aim in this paper is to do just this, for a class of d-dimensional so(d) higgs models
in which the higgs eld is a d-component vector of the so(d), for the two cases of d = 2 and
d = 3. what distinguishes such models is that their instantons result in curvature eld strengths
that exhibit inverse square behaviour. this property contrasts with the pure-gauge behaviour
of the arbitraryscale yang-mills (ym) instantons [1] and can result in far reaching (physical)
consequences. in the d = 3 case, it leads to a dilute coulomb gas of instantons, as shown by
polyakov [3] long ago, while the corresponding instantons in d = 4 share this property [12] and
can possibly also enable the construction of a dilute coulomb gas [13]. this is our physical
justication for making a systematic study of these higgs models, and we concentrate on the
d = 2, 3 cases here. thus both models under consideration here are the familiar ones, namely
the abelian higgs model in d = 2 and the georgiglashow model in d = 3.

the instantons in these two, 1 + 1 and 2 + 1 dimensional models, are the well known topolog-
ically stable nielsen-olesen vortices [14] and the t hooftpolyakov monopoles [15], respectively.
it is therefore the sphaleron solutions to these models that are the remaining entities to be stud-
ied. in this connection, it is true that the sphalerons of the abelian higgs model were studied
extensively long ago [16, 17], but we repeat it here for the sake of completeness so that both cases
d = 2 and d = 3 be treated similarly, and, because the presentation of the results in the literature
can be rened.
in particular we clarify the situation with respect to the question of periodic
boundary conditions in the spacelike coordinate used in the literature [16, 17]. the sphaleron in
the d = 3 case has been studied recently [18]. we have carried out the analysis of the sphaleron
solutions in both models employing both the non-contractible loop (ncl) used by manton [4] for
the weinberg-salam model, to which we refer in this paper as the geometric loop construction,

as well as the the nite energy path method of akiba et al [25], to which we refer as boundary
loop construction.

in the study of the sphaleron solutions, a central role is played by the chernsimons num-
ber, which in the weinbergsalam model is calculated from the second chernpontryagin (cp)
density. in d dimensional higgs models we consider, the natural candidate for the latter is the
dimensionally reduced cp density of the ym eld on ird  s4pd, where 4p > d [19]. the d
dimensional model is decided by p such that the action density is bounded from below by di-
mensionally reduced the cp density in question. the simplest such model corresponds to the
case where 4p is the smallest number greater than d. both the abelian higgs model and the
georgiglashow models considered in this work are the simplest models whose cp densities are
arrived at by the corresponding dimensional descent of the second cp density of the su(2) ym
eld.

the analysis of the abelian higgs system in 2 dimensions is presented in section 2.

in
subsection 2.1 and 2.3 respectively, the geometric and boundary loop constructions are presented,
while in subsection 2.2 a discussion of our constructions is contrasted with what is usually given
in the literature, and the dierences are commented on.

the analysis of the georgi-glashow model in 3 dimensions is presented in section 3.

in
subsection 3.1 the boundary loop construction is presented. the geometric loop construction
is presented in subsection 3.2 . since the sphaleron solution of this model turns out to be
eectively the solution of an abelian higgs model, a family of arbitrary vorticity n sphalerons
are contructed in subsection 3.2 . subsection 3.3 is devoted to a brief discussion of the magnetic
and electric properties of this sphaleron and the congurations on the geometric loop. in section
4, we give a summary of our results.

d = 2: sphalerons in the abelian higgs model

our objective in this section is to construct noncontractible loops (ncl) between two topolog-
ically neighbouring vacua which feature the sphaleron at the top of the energy barrier. our
constructions run exactly parallel to those of manton [4] and akiba et.al [25] respectively. this
diers from the analysis of bochkarev and shaposhnikov [16] in that the latter employ periodicity
in the space variable to construct the ncl.

the so(2) abelian higgs model in d = 2 spacetime dimensions is given by the euclidean

lagrange density

with  = 1 + i2, d =  + ia, i.e. we used the identity so(2) = u(1) to write the higgs
dublett i as one complex eld.

adding the inequalities

the cross terms of the squares yield a lower bound for the euclidean action, l   which becomes
a topological lower bound, i.e.  can be written as total divergence

if 0 = 1.  is the chernsimons form of this model. it consists of a gauge dependent and a
gauge independent part which is a typical feature of higgs theories in even spacetime dimensions
[19].

the topological lower bound (which can be generalised to 0 6= 1) ensures the stability of
the instantons of the model, the abelian higgs vortex, which can be found using the radially
symmetric ansatz

(5)

the corresponding instanton solutions are selfdual provided 0 = 1, then they saturate the
inequality l   and hence are characterised by integer chernsimons number (also called
chernpontryagin charge in the context of instanton physics)

(6)

this can be arrived at by subjecting the second chern-pontryagin class of the su(2) ym eld
on ir2  s2 to dimensional descent [19].
ecting the topological properties of the mapping

the chernsimons number depends only on the behaviour of the instanton at innity, re-


inst : s1

spacetime  s1

higgs.

(7)

in contrast to the instanton, the sphaleron is a static object, i.e. it does not depend on the
euclidean time. nontheless, it is an euclidean spacetime object closely related to the instan-
ton as it is the extremum of the energy functional of a set of static congurations connecting
distinct vacua in a topologically nontrivial way, i.e. a noncontractible loop (ncl). the ncl,
parametrised in terms of euclidean time, is an instantonlike object and the loop as a whole hav-
ing integer topological number. the chern-simons number ncs is also parametrized in terms of
the euclidean time,

(8)
hence the loop can be parametrizes in terms of ncs, the latter taking on all values between 0
and 1.
to construct and study the sphaleron, we start from the static energy which in the temporal

choosing the particular ansatz  =   ir, a = 0, this reduces to the wellknown real 4 energy
functional

the 4 kink on its own is a stable soliton, but it becomes instable as soon as it is embedded in
complex isospace which can be shown explicitly by investigating the uctuation spectrum [20].

2.1 the geometrical loop construction

to show that (, a)sph = (, 0) are sphaleron congurations of the abelian higgs model, we
construct the corresponding ncl of nite energy congurations connecting two vacua through
the sphaleron in a topologically nontrivial way.

vacua are static congurations with zero energy, i.e. they are given by  = g, a = ig1xg
with g  u(1). we use the remaining gauge freedom of the theory to x the vacuum to (, a)vac =
(1, 0) and comment on the choice of gauge later on.
following the geometrical loop construction of manton [4], we consider rst the topological
properties of the higgs eld at innity. one dimensional space at innity shrinks to the discrete
set (ir) = s0
space = {1}. hence one has to distinguish two mappings +,  instead of
one mapping  which depends on continous angular coordinates in higher space dimensions.
to construct a geometrical ncl [4], we introduce a single loop parameter   s1
loop as additional
degree of freedom such that

+ : s1

loop  s1

higgs

is a topologically nontrivial mapping which we choose to be

+ :  7 e2i ,

(12)

(13)

whereas   1 is chosen to be topologically trivial. the nite energy condition then also xes
the gauge eld at innity as the covariant space derivative in (9) has to vanish, hence

a := a(r  ) = i()1x = 0.

(14)

the general manton loop ansatz constructed using the topological ingredients +, a is

now given by

 = (1  h(x)) + h(x)+, a = f a = 0

(15)

where  has to be chosen such that the loop starts and ends in the vacuum and reaches the
sphaleron for  = 
= h. in the so(2) model,
(16)

2 , hence | =0 = | = = 1, | = 

 = cos2  + i sin  cos 

= h+| = 

2

2

is a convenient choice. moreover, (x  ) =  requires h(x  ) = 1. the loop is
then given by
(17)

a  0.
inserting the ansatz (17) into the static energy functional (9) yields

(, x) = ei [cos  + ih(x) sin  ],

which for  = 

(h)2 +

1
e[ , a] = e [h] = sin2  z (cid:20) 1
sin2  (1  h2)2(cid:21) dx
2
32
2 reduces to the 4 model, e = 
= esphal = 1
3.
for any xed value of   [0, ], e [h] is minimised by
x  x0
4 (cid:19) .

h = tanh(cid:18)sin 

2

the energy along the resulting minimal energy loop is

e( ) =

1
3

sin3 

(18)

(19)

(20)

which has a maximum for 
2 . this minimax procedure therefore shows that (, a)sph = (, 0)
is a sphaleron of the abelian higgs model. to construct the ncl for the kinktype sphaleron
(, a)sph = (+, 0), one simply has to use

 :  7 e2i

(21)

as the topologically nontrivial mapping.

to calculate the increase of the chernsimons number along the ncl, one has to treat
the loop parameter as a (euclidean) time dependent quantity  =  (t) with  (t = ) = 0,
 (t = ) = . inserting the loop ansatz (17) into (8), one can split the double integral into a
space volume and a surface integral, resulting in

2

ncs(t0) =

 (cid:26)z 
as expected, one nds ncs = 1
has ncs = 1.

2.2 gauging and nonperiodic boundary conditions

the vacuum convention chosen above can be changed by gauging the geometrical loop,

   = g ,

a = 0  a = igxg.

one could, e.g., require  = g   1 for x   and x  +, choosing the gauge [20]

g = ei (x),

(x) =

2


arctan(cid:18) x

(cid:19) + 1

(23)

(24)





in both cases, one nds for the gauge transformed chernsimons form 0  0 + 1

( 6= 0 arbitrary) which yields a(x) = 2
2+x2 . concerning its  dependence, g can be considered
either as a set of static transformations parametrised by  and applied to each corresponding
static conguration along the loop separately, or as one time dependent gauge transformation
applied to the  (t) time dependent loop as a whole.
in the latter case, the temporal gauge
condition is violated, a0  0   .
4  ,
1  1  1
4  . inserting this into eq. (22), we nd explicitly that the chernsimons number is
gauge invariant, i.e. also the gauged manton loop ( , a) starts at a vacuum with ncs( = 0) = 0,
reaches the sphaleron at ncs(cid:16) = 
2 and ends a vacuum with ncs( = ) = 1. this is not
surprising, as  =  is a gauge invariant quantity.
the main new feature of the gauged geometrical loop is the representation of the vacuum
states between which the loop interpolates. generalizing the gauged geometrical loop ( , a) to
a larger range of the loop parameter   ir, the loop reaches a vacuum state for any  = n,
n  zz, now given by

2(cid:17) = 1

(n) = (cid:18)

 + ix(cid:19)n
  ix

a(n) =

n

2 + x2

(25)

these vacua can be labeled by a topological charge dened as

q :=

2

 z 0dx  q|( (n), a(n)) =

1

2 z a(n)dx = n.

(26)

in the literature [16, 17] this is usually the only topological number discussed in the context
of the so(2) abelian higgs sphaleron. it should be stressed that it is dierent from the chern
simons number which is the proper quantity to be ivestigated in the context of the sphaleron ncl

and its relation to the instanton. the topological charge used above to label the vacua makes use
of the gaugevariant part of the chernsimons form. only in even dimensions does the chern
simons form exhibit a gaugevariant part [19]. in these dimensions one can distinguish between
small and large gauge transformations, depending on whether they leave the topological
charge (dened as space volume integral of the zero component of the chernsimons form)
invariant or not.

another confusion about the so(2) abelian higgs found in the literature [16, 17] concerns the
use of periodic boundary conditions in the space coordinates for the gauge elds, i.e. putting the
elds on the circle instead of using the nonperiodic vacuum structure (25) [20]. the sphaleron,
however, is denitely never a periodic object in space, but always the 4 kink, a contradiction
which cannot be solved by simpy taking the limit of innite period.

the periodic solutions of 4 theory [21] and goldstone theory [22] in one dimension can be
more gainfully interpreted as the periodic instantons in euclidean quantum mechanics. these
periodic solutions describe tunneling from thermally excited states, the temperature being given
by the inverse period. at some value of the period, the periodic instantons reduce to the (time
independent) sphaleron which in the case of euclidean quantum mechanics is just a constant
solution. this eect describes the phase transition between classical and quantum behaviour
which is presently under intense investigation [23]. since periodic instantons (periodic in the
euclidean time, not in the spatial coordinate) are also known to exist in the abelian higgs model
[24], one should be even more careful about the notion of periodicity in this model.

2.3 aky boundary loop construction

a dierent technique for the construction of a ncl for the abelian higgs sphaleron is motivated
by the static minimal energy path construction by akiba, kikuchi and yanagida (aky) [25]
in the weinbergsalam theory. this ncl is constructed by minimizing a general spherically
symmetric static ansatz with parameter-dependent boundary conditions, i.e. not the loop ansatz
containing the loop parameter, but the boundary conditions. we shall refer to this type of
construction as boundary loop.

the spherically symmetric aky ansatz in one space dimension (in temporal gauge) is simple

and only puts some restriction on the symmetry properties of the parameter functions,

(x) = h(|x|) + ixk(|x|),

a(x) = f (x)

(27)

with x = sgn(x), i.e. h(x) = h(|x|) is an even, h(x) = xh(|x|) an odd function of x  ir.
under a gauge transformation g = ei(x), h and k are rotated,

h  h cos   k sin ,

k  k cos  + h sin ,

while f  f  , i.e. one can gauge f = 0 without loss of generality in the ansatz (27).

inserting the ansatz into the static energy functional yields

e[ , a] = e[h, k] = z (cid:20) 1

2

(h  + k )2 +

1
32

(1  h 2  k 2)2(cid:21) dx,

i.e. nite energy requires

(28)

(29)

h(x  ) = cos q,

k(x  ) = sin q.

(30)
extrema of e[h, k] with these boundary conditions (and h even, k odd) are found only for
q = 0 or q = , yielding the vacua h = 1, k = 0, and for q = 
2 with h = 0, k(x) = +(x) =
tanh(cid:16) x

4(cid:17) which is the sphaleron conguration.

the idea now is to construct a loop by increasing the boundary condition parameter q(t) as
a timedependent quantity from q(t = ) = 0 to q(t = ) = .
inserting the ansatz in
the chernsimons functional (22) and taking care of the boundary conditions for h, k when
evaluating 1|x=+

x= yields

1

ncs =
i.e. the sphaleron has ncs = 1
2 . one can minimise the static energy functional (29) for xed
chernsimons number by adding the chernsimons functional with a lagrange multiplier  to
the static energy functional, leading to the eulerlagrange equations

2 z (kh   hk )dx +

(31)

,

q


h  + k  +

1
8

h(1  h 2  k 2) = 0,

k   h  +

1
8

h(1  h 2  k 2) = 0

(32)

which are solved with the above boundary conditions by

h(x) = cos q,

k(x) = sin q tanh(cid:18)sin q

4

x(cid:19) ,

 = 8 cos q.

(33)

the energy along this loop is found to be

e(q) =

1
3

sin3 q,

and the chernsimons number along the aky loop for the abelian higgs model is

ncs(q) =

q


+

1
2

sin 2q.

(34)

(35)

therefore, the energy along the loop, e( ncs) agrees with the result (20,22) for the geometrical
ncl. hence there is no advantage of lower energy along the boundary loop compared to the
geometrical loop, both provide equivalent static minimal energy paths [25].

3.1 sphaleron and boundary loop construction

(40)

motivated by the aky technique in the weinbergsalam model [25], we try the general static
spherically symmetric ansatz for the higgs eld to nd the sphaleron and a corresponding ncl
simultanously,

 = i

[h(r)3 + k(r)xii] ,

the so(2) gauge transformation   g1g with

ij xij(r)(cid:27)

rotates the parameter functions,

h  h cos   k sin ,

k  k cos  + h sin .

this motivates the choice of a spatial spherically symmetric ansatz

in particular,

(45)

the requirement of regularity at the origin implies

fa(0) = 1,

fb(0) = 0,

fc(0) = 0, h(0) = const, k(0) = 0,

(46)

also the gauge transformation has to be regular at the origin, (0) = 0.

note that the ansatz (41,44) being radially symmetric, eqs. (4852) are guaranteed consistent
with the equations which are obtained by varying the original hamiltonian (40) and inserting the
ansatz (41,44) afterwards. this is in contrast with the situation in the weinbergsalam model
where the corresponding ansatz is not spherically symmetric and hence the consistency of the
ansatz there must be checked.

as the fth equation (52) is rstorder, it is obviously not a dynamical equation, but a
constraint on the system which is related to a gauge transformation in the space of the pa-
rameter functions (h, k, fa, fb, fc) [26]. this shows that this set of parameter functions has
one redundant degree of freedom which is already clear from the fact that we kept the gauge
freedom (42,43,45) in deriving the reduced hamiltonian (47). indeed, the gauge transformation
generated by eq. (52) is equivalent to the transformations (43,45) derived from the so(3) gauge
transformation g of the original elds (, ai) in (42).

the gauge transformation (43,45) can now be used to x fc  0 without loss of generality
in this gauge, the

in the ansatz (41). this choice corresponds to radial gauge xiai = 0.

for fb  0 and h  0 this reduces to the radial subsystem euclidean lagrangian of
the abelian higgs model in two spacetime dimensions (5) supporting the (topologically sta-
ble) abelian higgs vortex. the embedding of this two dimensional so(2)higgs vortex into

the so(3)higgs theory as a static object in three spactime dimensions, (, ai)sph yields the
sphaleron of the three dimensional model.

it is interesting to remark that the so(3) gauge eld of this sphaleron tends to one half times

a pure gauge at spatial innity, r  :

a property which the so(3) higgs sphalerons shares with the instanton of the same model [3].
this is not surprising if we consider that sphalerons and instantons are related objects.

requiring nite energy

e = z hd2x = z h0dr < 

(55)

xes the behaviour of the remaining parameter functions (h, k, fa, fb) at spatial innity to

h(r  ) = cos q
k(r  ) = sin q

fa(r  ) = (q) cos q
fb(r  ) = (q) sin q

(56)

with q  [0, ].
the relation between q and  = (q) can be determined from a more careful analysis of
the asymptotic behaviour of the parameter functions (h, k, fa, fb), using the eulerlagrange
equations of h0 which are

(kfa  hfb)  2rk(1  h 2  k 2)

(57)

(58)

(59)

(60)

of course, these equations agree with (4851), setting fc = 0. the fth equation (52) reduces to

which turns out to be an integration constant of the other four equations (5760).

the asymptotic analysis then xes (q) = cos q, and one obtains the following asymptotic

behaviour in the region mw r  1:

h(r)  + cos q  dh cos q  (mw r) 1
k(r)  + sin q  dh sin q  (mw r) 1

(62)

(63)

(64)

(65)

where dw , dh, dw are constants which can be determined numerically by solving eqs. (5760).
it is easy to check that mw r =:  is the convenient dimensionless radial variable in this model
which is also used in all numerical calculations.

solving eqs. (5760) in the mw r  1 region yields
ch(c2

with ca, cb, ck constants which again have to be determined from the numerical integration of
the equations of motion, and ch = 3 cb
ck

solutions of eqs. (5760) can only be found for three particular values of q, q  [0, ]. first,
q = 0 and q =  allow the vacuum congurations h  1, k  0, fa  1, fb  0 with zero
energy, resulting in the vacuum elds

.

3, 0!

(70)

second for q = 
2 the behaviour of the parameter functions at innity (6265) and at the origin
(6669) allow to set fb  0 and h  0 such that the so(2) symmetric abelian higgs vortex
conguration is an element of the subspace of so(3) higgs congurations given by the ansatz
(41,44) and the boundary conditions (46,56) in the radial fc  0 gauge. this is the sphaleron
solution.
to construct a loop from the subspace of so(3) higgs congurations discussed above, we
have to specify a one parameter subset ( , ai)q parametrised by the boundary constant q. three
points of the loop are already xed: the initial and nal vacua ( , ai)q=0, = (, ai) and the
sphaleron ( , ai)q= 
= (, ai)sph given by the parameter functions (fa, k)sph. we now have to
x the parameter functions (h, k, fa, fb) for all remaining values of q such that q becomes the
loop parameter.

2

instead of q, it is convenient to choose the chernsimons number as parameter along the
loop. therefore, we next calculate the chern-simons functional for the set of congurations
(41,44) with boundary behaviour (6265) at innity and (6669) at the origin, treating q = q(t)
as time dependent parameter such that a loop parametrised by q starts at an initial vacuum
with q(t = ) = 0 and ends at a nal vacuum with q(t = +) = , whereas the sphaleron is
reached at some time tsph, q(tsph) = 
2 .

inserting the ansatz (in radial gauge fc  0) into the chern-simons number functional

ncs(t0) =

1

2 (zir2

0|t=t0

t=d2x +z t0



dt lim

(71)

(72)

we obtain

ncs(q) = 

1

2 z (hf 

a + kf 

b) dr +

1
2

(1  cos q),

with q = q(t0). this yields ncs(q = 0) = 0 and ncs(q = ) = 1, hence the chernsimons
number increases by unity between the initial and the nal vacuum. for the sphaleron, the
surface integral in (71) yields ncs(cid:16)q = 
chernsimons number ncs. this is done by adding the integrand in (72),

to complete the loop construction, we minimise the static energy (55) for xed value of the

the vacua and the sphaleron, (0) = 1, () = 1, (cid:16) 
be determined from the behaviour of the functions fa, fb at r  .
we rst consider the sphaleron and its boundary loop for  = 1 which happens to be a
particularly simple case in the sense that the energy along the loop can be calculated analytically.

it is easy to check that eqs. (86) and (87) are rst integrals of eqs. (85) and (88), hence a
consistent solution of the system (8588) can be found by solving the rstorder system (86,87).

the resulting hamiltonian (91) is exactly of the same form as the one dimensional reduced
lagrangian (5) of the abelian higgs model, which becomes obvious by replacing the functions
(a, h) by (fa, k) formally, and by replacing 1 by 1 2
44 in the potential. solutions to this system
(which saturate the bounds (90) are known numerically.

exploiting the boundary behaviour (89) of these solutions, one can nd their energy depending

on the lagrange multiplier  from the saturated lower bound (92),

e = z h0|=1,fb 0,h 

22

dr = 2 1

(93)

also the integral in the chernsimons number (72) depends only on the boundary values for this
particular loop, and we obtain

ncs =

1

2  1 



22! ,

resulting in an analytic expression for the energy along the boundary loop,

e(ncs) = 42ncs (1  ncs) .

as a result the slopes of e(ncs) at the beginning and the end of the loop are
= 42.

for coupling constants  > 1, the full set of equations (7578) has to be be solved numerically,
using  = 2r as rescaled dimensionless radial variable and eliminating q from the boudary

conditions at innity. in practice we replaced the boundary conditions (56) which also involve
the unknown function (q) by

h 2 + k 2

and solved eqs. (7578) for given value of , identifying q and (q) from the asymptotic behaviour
of the numerical solutions afterwards.

the energy e and chernsimons number ncs can be computed for these solutions. this
nally yields a static minimal energy loop connecting two topologically neighbouring vacua
through the sphaleron conguration which corresponds to the vortex of the abelianhiggs model.
the energy along the loop which can be parametrised by the chernsimons number, e(ncs),
is shown in fig. 1, for several values of the ratio m2
=  > 1. in this parameter region, the
h
m2

lagrange multipier is restricted to || < c = 22. e(ncs) approaches the vacua e = 0 for
  22 with slopes

independently of , because the slope of the energy curve approaching the vacua is given by
2c [25].
under the transformation

the symmetry e(ncs) = e(1ncs) is related to the invariance of h0 and f0 in eqs. (53.74)

which requires

h 7 h
k 7 k

fa 7 fa
fb 7 fb

q 7   q,

(  q) = (q).

it is easy to check that this transfrmation yields

ncs 7 1  ncs

(99)

(100)

(101)

while the energy is invariant, yielding the symmetry of the energy along the boundary loop
mentioned above.

the boundary loop of the so(3)higgs model we constructed is dierent from the original
aky construction in the weinbergsalam model [25]. the weinbergsalam sphaleron has a
pure gauge connection at innity. this allowed a boundary loop construction [25] where all
gauge elds along the loop tend to a pure gauge, in particular, gauge and higgs elds at innity
could be constructed as gauge transformation of the initial vacuum conguration, using the
gauge transformation which rotates the parameter elds and allows to gauge fc  0. this gauge
transformation g (42) also exists in the so(3)higgs boundary loop construction, but it can not
be used to construct the loop congurations at innity from the initial vacuum. in fact, applying
g=q to the initial vacuum ( , ai)q=0 = (, ai)+ yields the correct behaviour of the higgs eld,
but not of the gauge eld along the loop at spatial innity,

( , ai)q=0 =  i

thi is due to the fact that the sphaleron, which has to be a loop conguration, is one half times
a pure gauge at innity in accordance with the corresponding behaviour of the instanton.

we expect that this is a general feature of models which support both instanton and sphaleron,
i.e. the sphaleron behaves like the instanton at spatial innity, a fact which must be reected in
the boundary loop construction.

3.2 general vorticity sphalerons and geometrical loop construction
in general, the abelian higgs vortex has vorticity or winding number n  in. so far, we
considered only n = 1 for the so(3) sphaleron, but the generalisation to sphalerons of arbitrary
integer vorticity can easily be achieved. we use this generalisation in our presentation of the
second, geometrical loop construction.

the starting point of the geometrical loop construction is the sphaleron ansatz which we
generalise to vorticity n, replacing the spatial unit vector x by n = (cos n , sin n ) in the
ansatz,

 = i

3(cid:19) ,

(104)

where we use h(r) and f (r) as parameter functions [4]. inserting the ansatz into the hamiltonian
(40) yields the radial subsystem hamiltonian

hsph = 2( 1

finite energy and regularity at the origin require

f (r  ) = 1,

h(r  ) = 1,

f (0) = 0,

h(0) = 0.

(106)

and the solutions are equivalent to the vorticity n abelian higgs vortices as expected.

the geometrical loop construction starts from requiring nite energy, hence the potential term
in the hamiltonian (40) forces || =     s2
space, described
by the angular coordinate . therefore we consider the higgs eld for r   and add a single
loop parameter   s1

higgs at spatial innity (ir2) = s1

loop to construct a nontrivial mapping,
loop  s2
the simplest choice for this mapping with vorticity n is

space  s1

22 [, i].

(109)

according to the results of section 3.1, the gauge eld at innity along the loop is not a pure
gauge, in particular, it tends to half a pure gauge for r   for the sphaleron,  = 
2 .
we choose to be

in contrast to the choice of the vacua in section 3.1. this yields the geometrical ncl ansatz

(112)

(113)

one can also check that 2 is a radial function of r only which is necessary for the consistency
of the ansatz.

inserting the loop ansatz (111) into the static hamiltonian (40) yields

h = 2 sin3  ( 1

for  = 
h = 

(114)
2 , this geometrical loop ansatz reduces to the sphaleron ansatz (104), and of course
= hsph, whereas h =0 = 0 = h = for the vacua at the beginning and the end of the loop.
h can be minimized numerically for any value   [0, ], yielding again a static minimal
energy path connecting two neighbouring vacua through the sphaleron, the energy along the

2

loop being e( ) = r h dr.
one can also calculate the chernsimons number along the ncl, treating  =  (t) as time
dependent with  () = 0,  () = . for the manton loop ansatz (111), both the volume and
the surface integrals in eq. (71) contribute, resulting in

n
2

cos  sin2  z f (1  h)dr +

ncs( ) =
(1  cos  ).
2 , only the surface integral contributes to ncs = n

n
2

for the sphaleron  = 
2 , whereas the loop as a
whole has ncs = n. the vorticity n sphaleron therefore is the saddle point of a loop connecting
to vacua with chernsimons number dierence n.
the static minimal energy path of the so(3) gauge higgs sphaleron in the geometrical con-
struction, e(ncs), is shown in fig. (2) with vorticity n = 1 and several values of . comparing
the  = 1 geometrical loop with the corresponding boundary loop, we nd that the energy along
the geometrical loop is lower than that along the boundary loop except at the sphaleron and the
vacua where they are equal. this result holds also for  > 1.

3.3 magnetic and electric properties of georgiglashow sphalerons

since the eective equations governing the sphaleron solution of the 3 dimensional georgi
glashow model are those of the abelian higgs vortex with vorticity n (hence also magnetic
charge), we might expect that the sphaleron itself may carry magnetic charge.

the electromagnetic eld strength of the 3 dimensional georgiglashow model is the well-

known t hooft electromagnetic tensor [15, 18]

f := 

tr[f ]

qtr[2]

=

~  ~f
|~|

.

(116)

inserting the sphaleron conguration (104) into (116) yields f  0, therefore the sphaleron
itself carries neither magnetic nor electric charge. the situation is dierent if we consider the
complete ncl as the conguration dependent on the time parameter. for example, along the
boundary loop presented in section 3.1 with q = q(t) we have nonvanishing electric and magnetic
elds,

b = f12 = 

1
r

ei = f0i = ij

b

hf 
a + kf 
h 2 + k 2
xj
r

h fa + k fb
h 2 + k 2

.

it follows, by symmetry, that the electric charge of the ncl,

qe := lim

rzs(r)

~e  d ~s,

is always zero, whereas the ncl congurations may acquire magnetic charge

qm := z bd2x

(117)

(118)

(119)

(120)

at some values of the time parameter. clearly, the magnetic charge of the sphaleron and the
initial and nal vacua vanish according to the values that the functions fa, fb, k and h take for
these congurations. the same conclusion is arrived at also by inspecting the magnetic ux of
the vorticity n conguration calculated in terms of the geometric loop parameter 

qm = sin2  cos  n z 

0

(1  h)f dr ,

(121)

which vanishes at the sphaleron,  = 

2 and the vacuua  = 0 and  = .

one might think at this point that there is no reason why there should be no nonvanishing
electric ux if the temporal gauge condition a0 = 0 were relaxed in the spirit of the julia-zee
dyon [27]. in the a0 6= 0 one can solve the full euler-lagrange equations in minkowski space, of

to nd solutions that lead to nonvanishing electric ux qe, the solution must have the following
asymptotic behaviour

g(r)  dg + 2qe ln r,

mw r  1 ,

(124)

where dg is a constant. the asymptotic analysis of the equations, not exibited here, indeed
conrms the behaviour (124). these equations have been integrated in [18] numerically.

however, this static electrically charged solution can not be called a sphaleron since the
logarithmic behaviour of g(r) (which is a consequence of ln r being the fundamental solution of
the laplace operator in two dimensions) destroys the integrability of the static hamiltonian, i.e.
this electrically charged classical conguration does not have nite energy, rendering it useless as
a pseudoparticle in quantum eld theory. technically, this is related to the wellknown fact that
the energy integral of point charges in two dimensional electrodynamics is divergent.

4 summary and discussion

we have analysed the rst two in the hierarchy of so(d) gauged d dimensional higgs models
where the higgs elds are in the d-dimensional vector representation of so(d). in d = 2 and
3 these are the familiar abelian higgs model and the georgi-glashow model respectively. the
reason for having chosen these models is that they both support topologically stable nite action
solutions which we interpret as the instantons, and, they are expected to support sphaleron
solutions in the static limit, which we nd indeed to be the case. thus we have analysed the
rst two higgs models in this hierarchy, which support both instantons and sphalerons. this is
the main criterion of the work, and our motivations for it are explained in the introduction. our
analysis points the way to tackling the d = 4 case [12] which is of some denite physical relevance
inasfar as it promises a coulomb instanton gas [13], but which is considerably more complex.

since the instantons of these two models are well known solutions, namely the nielsenoleson
vortices [14] and the t hooftpolyakov monopole [15], the analysis of this paper is restriced to
the study of the sphalerons of these models.

indeed, the sphalerons of the abelian higgs model have been studied extensively in the
literature [16, 17, 20], but we give our own version here. the reason for this is rstly so that the
construction of the sphalerons of both models should proceed in the same lines, especially since
one of criteria is to map the way to carry this analysis to the d = 4 case. secondly, our construction
of the sphaleron of the abelian higgs model follows exactly the same procedure as those used
in the corresponding work for the weinberg-salam model, namely that of constructing a ncl
carried out by manton [4], and also that of constructing the path of nite energy congurations
carried out by akiba et.al. [25]. this contrasts with the presentation in the literature [16, 17, 20]
where the procedure is quite dierent from the case of the weinberg-salam model [4, 5, 25], in
particular imposing periodic boundary conditions [16] unnecessarily. this part of our work is
presented in section 2, where we have given both construction of the sphaleron, namely that of
manton and klinkhamer [4, 5] and that of akiba et.al. [25]. in addition, we have made a contrast
of our procedures with those existing in the literature. our procedure here making it possible
to formulate this problem in complete parallel to the weinberg-salam case is made possible
by our use of the systematically derived [19] chern-pontryagin density used in calculating the
chern-simons number.

in the larger part of this work we have presented the construction of the sphaleron in the three
dimensional georgi-glashow model. this is the work in section 3. again we have presented the
construction of the sphaleron in both the manton and klinkhamer [4, 5] procedure and the akiba
et.al. [25] one. it is very interesting that in the former case [4, 5], we nd that the sphaleron

is a solution to the eective abelian higgs model in the two spatial dimensions, embedded in
the so(3) model. in that case we have constructed a family of sphalerons characterised by a
vortex number n, availing of the fact that radially symmetric elds in two dimensions have
integer vorticity. we have also inquired whether this sphaleron has magnetic ux related to its
vorticity n and have found that the sphaleron itself, as well as the vacuua it falls between, have
zero magnetic ux, but that intermediate eld congurations do have nonvanishing magnetic
ux. we have also veried that by relaxing the temporal gauge, one can nd solutions to the
static eld equations leading to a nonvanishing electric ux [18], but in that case the energy
diverges logarithmically and hence there is no sphaleron solution that can be gainfully employed
in semiclassical eld theory. in addition to this, we have pursued the construction in the procedure
of akiba et.al. [25] and have constructed the nite energy path interpolating between the two
vacuua with the sphaleron at the top of this path with chernsimons number equal to 1
2. an
interesting circumstance here is that when the coupling constant of the higgs self-interaction
potential in the georgi-glashow model takes the critical value for which the (static) embedded
abelian higgs model can saturate the corresponding bogomolnyi bound, the nite energy path
can be constructed analytically without recourse to numerical computations.

our analysis of these two models has claried the similarities and dierences between the
sphalerons of the weinberg-salam model and those of the models in our hierarchy of so(d)
higgs models. in this respect, the d = 3 case is the most enlightening. we have learnt that the
structure of the geometric loop [4, 5] behaves very much like that of the weinberg-salam model,
and that the boundary loop [25] also behaves similarly inspite of the fact that the actual boundary
conditions are quite dierent in the two cases. in the process, we have given a unied treatment
for the construction of energy loops interpolating between vacuua for all models, bringing the
treatment of the abelian higgs case into line with the others. this we have done employing
both types of energy loops, geometrical [4] and boundary [25], whence we have learnt that the
geometric loop is lower than the boundary loop everywhere except at the sphaleron and the
vacuua where they are equal. presumably this is the case also for the weinberg-salam model.

as a nal remark we emphasise the similarity between the boundary loop construction for
the winberg-salam and the georgi-glashow models  in both of them the functions fb and h
are excited on the boundary loop. in addition both theories tend to sigma models in the limit of
the higgs masses becoming innit. with these two similarities in place, it seems that there may
well be bisphalerons [28, 29] in the static 3 dimensional georgi-glashow model.
