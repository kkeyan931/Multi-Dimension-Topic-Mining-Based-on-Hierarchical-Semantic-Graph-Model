abstract

we suggest that the boundary cosmological constant  in c < 1 unitary string theory

be regarded as the one-dimensional complex coordinate of the target space on which the

boundaries of world-sheets can live. from this viewpoint we point out that soliton-like

solutions appearing in string equations can be interpreted as analogues of d-instantons.

it turns out that our operator formalism developed in the preceding articles naturally

includes polchinskis combinatorics of boundaries.

recent progress has revealed the vital role of d-branes [1] in the nonperturbative as-

pects of string theory. however, there have been only a few work where the boundaries of

world-sheets as well as the d-branes are second-quantized systematically. among them,

polchinski made an interesting observation sometime ago [2] that the stringy nonpertur-

bative eects of the form ec /g [3] (g is the coupling constant of closed strings) could be

explained in terms of the combinatorics of boundaries in a target space with d-instanton

background.

in fact, when summing up connected diagrams in such target space, one

should take into account not only connected world-sheets, but also congurations where

disconnected world-sheets are attached together at d-instantons. then in the weak cou-
pling limit, the dominant contribution comes from the disk amplitude c/g for each
world-sheet, which will be accumulated to the form ec /g.

in order to investigate such many-boundary systems, however, it should be more

natural and convenient to use quantum string elds which can create and annihilate the

boundaries of world-sheets. furthermore, if we can introduce the quantum elds that

create loop boundaries of dirichlet type, then the interactions and combinatorics of d-

branes can be dealt with in a second-quantized way. though for critical strings it seems

dicult at present to fully carry out this program in string-eld language,1 there might
be a chance to do it for c  1 unitary case, because almost all the dynamical variables can
be gauged away with 2d dieomorphism, leaving the external lines only zero-modes (the

positions). this implies that the string eld theory could reduce to a local eld theory
in this case. we will show that actually the string eld theory for c = 1  6/p(p + 1)
(p = 2, 3, ...) reduces to a chiral 2d conformal eld theory by identifying the target-space

coordinate with the so-called boundary cosmological constant . in particular, the solitons

dab constructed by the present authors [5, 6] (to be described below) are interpreted as

analogues of d-instantons and shown to satisfy combinatorics similar to that of polchinski.

we start our discussion with recalling that noncritical c = 1 string theory is a d = 2
critical string theory with linear dilaton background [7]: g(x) =  = diag(1, +1),
b(x) = 0 and (x) = (q/2)x 1, where x  ( = 0, 1) is a coordinate of target space,

and g(x), b(x) and (x) are, respectively, the background metric, antisymmetric

2-tensor and dilaton. upon requiring the nl model with this background to be in-

1 an attempt in critical string eld theory can be found in [4], where the interaction between a d-brane

and a closed string eld are investigated by coupling the string eld to the boundary state.

variant under the weyl transformation as well as the 2d dieomorphism, the value of q

is uniquely determined up to sign (which can be absorbed into a redenition of x 1) as

q = q2(26  d)/3 = 4/, and this solution has no higher  corrections since the

system is essentially gaussian (hereafter we take the cft unit,  = 2). this nl-model

action with the linear dilaton term has exactly the same form with that of liouville grav-

ity coupled to c = 1 conformal matter if a spatial coordinate is regarded as liouville eld,

 = x 1:

s[x ] = z d2qg( 1

qx) ,

(1)

with q = (0, q). (here we have dropped the boundary term, or taken the world-sheet

metric such that its geodesic curvature vanishes.) in fact, this is obtained [8, 9] if we

impose only the 2d dieomorphism on a nl model with a scalar eld x 0 (with negative
metric) and express the world-sheet metric as gab = egab which uctuates around a xed

metric gab. furthermore, the c < 1 case can be realized from c = 1 (d = 2) by making a
lorentz boost on (x 0, x 1)  (x 0 cosh   x 1 sinh , x 0 sinh  + x 1 cosh ) as well as
on q with hyperbolic angle e = (1  c + 25  c)/26 [10], and the corresponding

nl-model action with vanishing cosmological constant would be (after the wick rotation

x = ix 0):

s[, x] = z d2qg( 1

0 and now q = q(25  c)/3. note that after the wick rotation it has
where c = 1  122
an invariance under the shift x  x + 2/0 (including the case when boundaries exist).
in 2d gravity we can introduce the macroscopic-loop operator (l) [11] that is dened

eectively as creating a loop boundary of length l on the random surface. its laplace
0 dl el (l),

transform is dened with the boundary cosmological constant  as ()  r 
and when c = 1  6/p(p + 1) it is expanded around  =  (equivalently l = 0) as

() =

1

p xn on n/p1,

where ons are scaling operators and have the following form [8, 9]:

on = z d2qg en() einx(),

3

(3)

(4)

with n = 0(n  2p  1) and n = 0(n  1) [9]. note that these operators are
also invariant under the shift x  x + 2/0. this implies that the external on-shell
states eectively live on a target space with the x-direction compactied with radius

1/0, while the bulk of world-sheet lives whole in the 2d target space. this is a specialty

of the discrete unitary series.

now we are going to argue that this  could be regarded as a coordinate of target

space. one justication comes from the 2d-gravity side. in fact, in the matrix-model reg-

ularization of this system, the () is obtained as the continuum limit of the resolvent of
a random matrix m, f (p ) = tr (p  m)1, by setting p = pc ea with pc the convergence
radius of h f (p )i around p =  and a the lattice spacing. on the other hand, according
to our experience in any matrix models which generate random surfaces in c-dimensional

target space (see [12] for example), the argument of the resolvent is always identied with

an extra coordinate of target space (thus totally d = c + 1-dimensions). this motivates

us to identify  with a coordinate of target space.

this idea can be elaborated more if we stand on the string-theory side.

in fact,

substituting eq. (4) into (3), we have

()  z d2qg xn

 z d2qg

en0() ein0x()  n/p

1

 1/p  e0(()+ix()) .

(5)

here we have used en0(()+ix()) em0(()+ix())  e(n+m)0(()+ix()), since the sin-
gularities from contact interaction both for  and x cancel each other. we also neglected

possible coecients on the right hand side of (4) which would not give essential changes

to the singularity behavior in (5). noticing that the whole expression includes only  (not
),2 and also that the integrand is a delta function in a complex plane, we thus see that

the role of () is substantially to create a loop boundary in one-dimensional complex

target space with the (exponentiated) coordinate . furthermore, due to the form  1/p,
any observables should be invariant under the rotation   e2ip which corresponds to
the shift x  x  2/0. although the above arguments could be rened more, we may
conclude that the on-shell boundaries live on a complex one-dimensional target space with
2 this is also a specialty of c < 1. for c = 1 there will appear both  and  as well as extra discrete

states. the relationship between c = 1 and c < 1 is reminiscent of the one between ads3 and ads2 in

the ads/cft correspondence [13].

a chiral coordinate  with periodicity   e2ip, and the role of the operator () is to
pin the world-sheet at the point  1/p = e0(()+ix()).

an operator formalism of c < 1 string eld theory is developed in [5, 6]. there

the string eld () is expressed as the rst derivative of a scalar eld 0(), and has
the following mode expansion under the zp-twisted vacuum |  i: ()  0() =
(1/p)pnz n n/p1 with [n, m] = n n+m,0 and n |  i = 0 (n  0). it thus raises a
monodromy among p scalar elds a() (a = 0, 1, ..., p  1) as a(e2i) = [a+1]()
with [a]  a (mod p). the correlation functions (generally disconnected) are then given
by

h (1)    (n)i  z 
dl1    dln el11lnn d (l1)    (ln)e
g (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

and the connected correlation functions are obtained as their cumulants. here the normal

characterizes the theory and corresponds schematically to the nl-model action s =

the generators of the w1+ algebra [18] are given by the mode expansion

here ca() and ca() (a = 0, 1, ..., p  1) are the fermions constructed from scalars by
bosonization:

ca() = ka : ea() :,

ca() = ka : ea() :,

(9)

where ka is a cocycle factor that ensures the correct anticommutation relations between
dierent indices a 6= b, and all the operators are again normal-ordered with respect to
sl(2, c) invariant vacuum. in addition to the w1+ constraints, we further require that
| i is a decomposable state.3
3 a state | i is called decomposable if it is written as | i = eh |  i, where h is a bilinear form of the
fermions. this is equivalent to the statement that  (x) = h  | exp{p
n=1 xnn} | i is a  function of the
kp hierarchy [19]. it is proved in [17] that this set of conditions (w1+ constraints and decomposability)

is equivalent to the douglas equation [20], [p, q] = 1.

a d-instanton is here.

figure 1: geometrical meaning of the d-instanton operator. all the points on the bound-

ary are mapped to .

now we try to construct the d-instanton operator in this operator formalism. by

denition it should be expressed as an operator that species a point  at which bound-

aries of world-sheets are glued together (see fig. 1). since there exists a redundancy

reecting the invariance under one-dimensional dieomorphism along each boundary, this

should be gauge-xed if one would like to count only independent congurations. this
can be simply done by creating strings at  not with 0() but with 0(), since
for the latter the redundancy that is proportional to loop length is automatically di-
0 dlel (1/l) (l). taking also into account the monodromy of
vided out: 0()  r 
scalar elds, we should treat all the a()s as the gauge-xed string elds on an equal
footing. thus, after summing over the number of the boundaries glued at , we have
a /n!) (a())n = exp {qaa()}, where 1/n! is a statistical factor and we assume
pn(qn
that a boundary of a connected world-sheet is accompanied with the weights qa for each
a(). furthermore, we need to make an integration over the position  in order to
restore the translational invariance of x with period 2/0, which corresponds to the
contour integration surrounding  =  p times. this indicates that this integration over
 can be interpreted as the one over a collective coordinate of a d-instanton. on these

6

grounds, we can identify the d-instanton with an object which locally couples to the scalar

elds a() at the position  with charges qa. this leads us to the following partition

function with n d-instantons:

zn = i p

d1   i p

dn (cid:28) epn

i=1 ~q~(i)(cid:29) ,

(10)

where ~q  ~(i) = pp1

a=0 qaa(i) and i represents the collective coordinate of the i-th d-
instanton. note that this equation actually realizes polchinskis combinatorics of bound-

aries [2]. after summing over n, we obtain

z =

n
n!

zn



xn =0

= (cid:28) exp(cid:26)i p

d e~q~()(cid:27)(cid:29) ,

(11)

where 1/n! is a statistical factor and log  is a chemical potential.

in order for this

expression to give a correct background, the state expnh p d e~q~()o| i must satisfy
the w1+ constraints when | i does. this is equivalent to the condition that the operator
h p d e~q~() should commute with any generators of the w1+ algebra, and it is shown
in [5] that, for this condition to hold, only two charges among qa can take nonvanishing
values with 1. therefore, the operator dab constructed in [5, 6] turns up again:4

dab = i p d

2i

ca()cb()  i p d

2i

ea()b()

(a 6= b).

(12)

furthermore, since there are various ways to choose the set a and b, we can introduce the

set of chemical potentials ab correspondingly, and nally have the following form instead

of (11):

z = * ya6=b

exp {abdab}+ = * ya6=b

exp(cid:26)abi p

d ea()b()(cid:27)+ .

(13)

thus, we conclude that the dab is the operator that creates a d-instanton and the

qa6=b eabdab the creation operator of multi d-instantons. notice that in [6] the form
of the multi d-instanton operator was originally determined by requiring that the decom-
posability be preserved when acting on | i.

in this short letter, we demonstrate that the conformal eld theory that used to be

a technical tool to compactly describe macroscopic-loop amplitudes, is actually the eld

4 it is also shown there that the leading eects of the expectation values of dabs have the form ec /g,

whose exponents all agree with those that were obtained through the analysis of string equations [21, 22].

theory that describes the target space where the boundaries of world-sheets live. we

also give a discussion that the solitonic solutions appearing in string equations can be

interpreted as the contributions from the analogues of d-instantons, which closely follow

polchinskis combinatorics of boundaries.

it is surprising that our operator formalism

naturally included this combinatorics. finally we point out the similarities between non-

critical strings and the sine-gordon theory (or more generally ane su(p) toda eld

theories) since for both the fundamental degrees of freedom are described by scalar elds
a corresponding to fundamental weights (one can show that pp1
a=0 a  0 by the w1+
constraints) while the solitons are expressed by their exponentials associated with simple
roots, a  b.
