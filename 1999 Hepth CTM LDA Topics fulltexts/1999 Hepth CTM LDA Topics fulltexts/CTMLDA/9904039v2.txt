abstract

the prescription of the ads/cft correspondence is rened by using a regulariza-
tion procedure, which makes it possible to calculate the divergent local terms in the
cft two-point function. we present the procedure for the example of the scalar eld.

it has been stated in most papers on this subject that the correspondence between a elds
theory on anti-de sitter space (ads) and a conformal eld theory (cft) on its boundary is
formally described by the formula [1, 2]

eiads [] =(cid:28)expz ddx 0(x)o(x)(cid:29) ,

(1)

where the action iads is calculated on-shell for a eld conguration  satisfying a dirichlet
condition on the ads boundary and the boundary value 0 couples as a current to the
conformal eld o living on the ads boundary. thus, the formula (1) enables one to calculate
correlation functions of the eld o in the boundary conformal eld theory. there are two
subtle points, which this formal description does not address. first, a dirichlet boundary
value problem in general is not well dened for anti-de sitter space, since a generic eld does
not propagate to the boundary. this point has been addressed by formulating the theory with
a boundary lying inside the anti-de sitter space. using this approach the two-, three- and
four-point functions of various elds have been calculated (see [3] for a recent comprehensive
list of references). secondly, although the -prescription yields the non-contact contributions
to the correlators in agreement with conformal eld theory, the singular contributions for
coincidence points have so far escaped a direct calculation. previous work has focused on
obtaining a nite action by interpreting the correlators as distributions [4] and regularizing
the action by adding boundary counter terms [5, 6]. two loop corrections to super yang mills
correlators have been calculated in [7] and contribute only to the contact terms. however,
we think that a regularization scheme must include a prescription on how to calculate the
divergent contact contributions before any counterterms are added.

the aim of this letter is to provide a rened prescription of the ads/cft correspondence,
with which non-local and local terms of the cft two-point function can be calculated. we
would like to emphasize that it is not our aim to obtain regularized cft correlation functions.
we shall use the conventional representation of anti-de sitter space by the space xi  r,

(i = 1, . . . d), x0 > 0 with the metric

let us consider the example of a scalar eld [8], which satises the equation of motion

ds2 = (x0)2dxdx.

a solution of equation (3) can be written in the form

(2  m2)(x) =(cid:2)x2

0  x0(d  1)0  m2(cid:3) (x) = 0.

where (y) is some boundary eld and the bulk-boundary kernel is given by

(x) =z ddyk(x, y)(y),

here, k is a modied bessel function (mac donald function) and  is related to the mass
parameter by

in addition, we have introduced the regulating factor ek2 in order to make the integral
well dened for all values of x0 and x  y. in the limit   0 equation (4) reduces to the
standard dirichlet kernel. it will turn out that the limits   0 and   0 should be taken
simultaneously with  being of order 2.
the cft two-point function is determined by the boundary normal derivative of the

kernel (4), which is given by

consider rst the case of non-coincident points x and y. as without regularization, we use
the expansion

where we used the notation (a)j = (a + j)/(a). proceeding to expand the logarithm in
equation (5) one obtains

where the rst set of dots indicates analytic terms of order z2n (n > 1) and the second set
higher order non-analytic terms. substituting equation (7) into equation (5) we recognize
integrals of the type

here, (a, c, z) is the degenerate hypergeometric function. for x 6= 0 we can take the   0
limit and replace  with the leading term of its asymptotic expansion [9], which yields

we notice that for the analytic terms,  = 2n, the gamma function in the denominator
diverges, so the integral becomes zero. the same holds for the subleading terms of the
asymptotic expansion. hence, the analytic terms do not contribute to the nite distance
two-point function. on the other hand, for the leading non-analytic term,  = 2, we
obtain (still for x 6= y)

0k(x, y)|

where  = d/2 +  and c = ()/(d/2()). the higher order non-analytic terms in
equation (7) contribute with higher powers of  and can be neglected in the   0 limit.
hence, we nd agreement with previous results [8]. a nice and simple check of this procedure
is provided by the conformally coupled scalar eld,  = 1/2, where the calculation can be
done exactly.

let us now turn to the local terms in the two-point function. in this case, it is more
useful not to carry out the expansion (7), since all its terms would contribute because of
(a, c, 0) = 1. consider instead the expression (5) directly with x = y. using the identity

and changing the integration variable to s = k we nd

moreover, if 2 < d, i.e. for d2 < 4m2 < 0, one could determine a such that  = 0. for
example, in the conformally coupled case,  = 1/2, one nds

the contribution (12) to the two-point function can be compensated by adding a local

to the ads action of a scalar eld. however, one must notice that this only eliminates the
contact term, but does not regularize the two-point function.

in conclusion, we have presented in this letter a rened prescription of the ads/cft
correspondence, which invokes a regularization scheme in order to calculate the contact
contributions to the cft correlators. our calculation shows that in general there is such
a contribution to the two-point function, but it can be compensated by adding a covariant
local surface term to the ads action. alternatively, it might serve as a regulator for the
cft two-point function and thus eliminate the need to add counterterms. we think that
this is an interesting topic for further study.
