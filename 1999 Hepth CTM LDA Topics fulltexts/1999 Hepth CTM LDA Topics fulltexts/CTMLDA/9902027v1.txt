the mechanism of connement of gluons and quarks is very important
to understand. a suggestion of thooft1 and mandelstam2 is that magnetic
monopoles must play a crucial role in connement. the high energy limit
of qcd has been studied by perturbation theory due to the small coupling
strength of the qcd running coupling constant and experimental results
conrm the use of perturbation theory in this region3. here the gluons are
massless and the color symmetry is an exact symmetry. at low energies, the
coupling is strong and non-perturbative methods are to be invoked. this
region is not completely understood. color connement is possibly due to a
dual meissner eect2,4,5 and this suggests that in the infrared region, some
other variables, other than aa
, may be more relevant. the idea of thooft1
is to make an abelian projection and kondo6 has examined this for su(2)
gauge theory by integrating the non-abelian degrees of freedom to obtain
an abelian projected eective eld theory. here, the relation between the
non-abelian gauge elds and the monopole conguration is not clear. re-
cently, faddeev and niemi7 have proposed a set of variables for describing
the infra-red limit of 4-dimensional su(2) and su(n) gauge theory. this is
a continuation of the earlier works of corrigan et.al.,8 and cho9. in ref.9,
a complex scalar eld  for the monopole has been introduced and conne-
ment is suggested by dynamically breaking (coleman-weinberg mechanism)
the magnetic symmetry. on the other hand, faddeev and niemi7 propose a
non-linear sigma model action as relevant in the infra-red limit of yang-mills
theory, motivated by wilsonian renormalization group arguments.

in this letter, a gauge eld conguration for the infra-red limit of qcd
is proposed in which the magnetic connement of gluons and quarks will be
realized. by considering the dual version, the electric connement will as
well be realized.

the proposed su(3) gauge eld congurations aa

 , for the infrared region

of qcd, is taken to satisfy

 b = a + gf acbac
where a  su(3) and are chosen such that

b = 0,

(1)

aa = 1

dabcbc =

a,

(2)

with dabc as the symmetric gell-mann su(3) tensor. now, in the infra-red
region, the gauge group manifold is not the complete su(3) group manifold
spanned by arbitrary as but a submanifold spanned by those as satisfying
(2) and the relevant gauge eld congurations aa
 are determined by (1).
classically, the wu and wu10 ansatz for the su(3) gauge eld, satisfying the
euler-lagrange equations of pure su(3) gauge theory and the construction
a = dabcf b
 satisfy (1) and (2)11. instead, here we will choose to solve
(1) for aa
. the second relation in (2) is very special to su(3) and will be
crucial in what follows.

 f c

a solution to (1)12 is

aa
 = c a 

4
3g

f abc b c,

(3)

where c is arbitrary. in obtaining (3), we have derived a useful relation for
as in (2),

f abcf edcbed = a,

(4)

which will be used subsequently. the gauge eld conguration (3) and the
submanifold determined by (2) are proposed to describe the infra-red region
of qcd. relations (1), (2) and (3) are self-consistent. it is to be noted here
that a aa
 = c 6= 0, in contrast to the classical conguration described
in ref.11.

aa

there are two important consequences that follow from (1). usually a
mass term for the gauge elds, m2aa
 cannot be present in the lagrangian
density due to its gauge non-invariance. since under a gauge transformation,
the eld changes as aa
 b, in view of (1), if we consider gauge
transformations within the submanifold, then such a mass term is allowed in
it. this is similar to dening the state vector in the heisenberg picture in
quantum mechanics13. h = exp(i ht
h )s(t), i.e., as s(t) evolves in time,
3

 = dab

it is brought back to h = s(0) at every instant. second, if we choose
a lorentz covariant gauge aa
s in (3), then there will be
no gribov ambiguity14 in xing the gauge in view of (1), as long as we are
within the submanifold.

the eld strength f a

 in (3) is
calculated, using the relations (2), (4) and the relations among the f and d
tensors15, as

   aa

f a

 is su(3) orthogonal to a 16, i.e.,

f abcbc.

it is found that f a

(5)

(6)

consistent with (1). unlike the case of su(2) 8,9, this does not mean that
 is along a. although the rst term in (5) is along a, the second term
f a
is not. if a tensor eld strength g is constructed as g = af a
, then
g = f  4

where x = f abcabc. this action coincides with the structure of
the eective action for abelian projected qcd of kondo6. instead of this
procedure, we will consider the usual action for pure qcd.

this action has u(1) symmetry, c  c + . it will be convenient to
3 a and then in the strong coupling limit (the last term
rescale the as as g

in (7) is omitted hereafter in the strong coupling limit. it can be included at
the end and this will not change the conclusions), the above action becomes

(8)

showing the abelian dominance for the infra-red limit of qcd. here the eld
strength f is coupled to x = f abcab c. first of all it is seen that
x = f abca(b c) 6= 0 and the dual strength x = 1
2 x
violates the bianchi identity,

 x =

this along with

3 is

f abcabcdx  dx = 

xdx  dx = 4m,(10)

a topological invariant, imply that magnetic monopoles are present in (8) and
coupled to f. second, as in the infra-red region, we proposed the gauge
eld conguration (3) in the submanifold determined by (2), a mass term
m2aa

 can be introduced. from (3) it follows that

aa

  cc. thus a mass term for aa

after rescaling a by g
3 as used in (8) and taking the strong coupling limit,
aa
 induces a mass term for c.
this breaks the u(1) invariance. a mass term for c can also be induced by
coleman-weinberg mechanism by introducing complex scalars  minimally
coupled to c as in the works of mandelstam2, thooft1 and cho9. then the
action (8) becomes

i = 

1

4 z {f 2

 

8
3

f x + m2cc}d4x.

the partition function for the above is

z = z [dc]exp(s),

5

(12)

(13)

and by integrating over the c eld (we suppress the gauge xing and ghost
terms here as we have only abelian elds), we nd

z = det

m2
2

) exp(z 8

x(2

1x d4x).

(14)

the eective lagrangian from this is, apart from the constant divergent
factor,

lef f

(15)

and as x is non-vanishing, this form is identical to the london case
of magnetic connement. this provides a magnetic connement of gluons
in the submanifold providing a scenario suggested by nambu5 that color
connement could occur similar to the magnetic connement in an ordinary
superconductor due to the meissner eect.

it is possible to provide electric connement by rewriting the action (8)

in its dual form. the generating functional for (8) is

z = z [dc]exp(

1

4 z {f 2

 

8
3

f x}d4x.

(16)

introducing the dual eld strength g dual to f, we can rewrite the above
z as

z = z [dc][dg]exp(cid:18)

fx(cid:19)d4x,

(17)

as the functional integration over g brings (15). from (16), variation with
respect to c-eld (f = c  c) gives {g  4
3 x} = 0, which
is solved for g as

g =  a +

4
3

x.

(18)

the eld a serves as dual to c. use of (17) in (16) eliminates c-eld and
we obtain

z = z [d a]exp[

(19)

this action possess dual u(1) invariance and coincides with the abelian
projected eective eld theory for qcd based on su(3) in its dual form.
denoting x = 1

2  x, we have

z = z [d a]exp[

1

4 z {( a   a)2

16

x a +

16
9

x x + m 2 a a}d4x],

(20)

where a mass term for a is introduced which can be thought of arising from
coleman-weinberg mechanism by invoking complex scalars for example. by
functionally integrating the dual eld a, the eective lagrangian density,
apart from constant (divergent) factors not involving elds, is found to be

lef f =

 x(2

1 x

x x,

(21)

which gives the electric (dual) connement of gluons in the submanifold.

the reason for realizing both magnetic and electric connement is the
property of x = f abcab c that both x and  x are non-
vanishing. these elds x and x couple to f and its dual. while the
non-vanishing of  x violating the bianchi identity is attributed to the
monopole topological conguration (in (9) and (10)), that of x is due to
the construction itself.

now we consider the qcd action with quarks. the standard action is

i =

(22)

the rst term has been expressed in terms of c and a. the dirac current

 minimally. using the expression (3) for aa

we nd the action becomes

apart from the kinetic energy term for quarks. this is identical to the london
case of magnetic connement including the quarks. in addition the monopole
current interacts with the dirac current through (2  m2
1. a similar
procedure can be eected for the dual version by coupling quarks to dual
eld a.

2 )

thus, by considering a submanifold for the group su(3) dened by both
the relations in (2) and proposing the gauge eld aa
 conguration (3) satis-
fying (1), we obtain a f a
 su(3) orthogonal to a. the action for qcd (7)
leads to magnetic connement of gluons as in the london theory of meiss-
ner eect. the dual version exists and produces the electric connement.
the mechanism has been extended to include quarks. here, the magnetic
and electric connement of quarks is obtained in addition to an interaction
between the monopole current and the dirac current.
