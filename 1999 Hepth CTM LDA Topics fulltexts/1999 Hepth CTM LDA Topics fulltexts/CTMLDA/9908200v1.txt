abstract

recently daviau showed the equivalence of ordinary matrix based dirac theory
formulated within a spinor bundle sx  c4
x, to a cliord algebraic formulation
within space cliord algebra c(r3, )  m2(c)  p  pauli algebra (matrices)
 h  h  biquaternions. we will show, that daviaus map  : c4 7 m2(c) is
an isomorphism. furthermore it is shown that hestenes and parras formulations
are equivalent to daviaus space cliord algebra formulation, which however uses
outer automorphisms. the connection between such dierent formulations is quite
remarkable, since it connects the left and right action on the pauli algebra itself
viewed as a bi-module with the left (resp. right) action of the enveloping algebra
p e  p  p t on p. the isomorphism established in this article and given by
daviaus map does clearly show that right and left actions are of similar type. this
should be compared with attempts of hestenes, daviau and others to interprete
the right action as the iso-spin freedom.

introduction

there is a long quest on a geometric intuitive description of dirac spinor elds. only
a few month after the publication of diracs rst paper [dirac 1928] charles gal-
ton darwin tried to re-express the strange new objects called half vectors by pauli
[pauli 1933] and spinors due to paul ehrenfest according to b.l. van der waerden, see
[budinich et al. 1988] with help of tensors [darwin 1928]. he did not fully succeed in
obtaining an equivalence by writing down complex tensor equations which yield diracs
theory twice over with a doubling of degrees of freedom from complexication; see
parra [parra] for a detailed review on this topic. madelung, trying the same tran-
scription essentially reproduced darwins results, most likely without knowing them
[madelung 1929]. also in the thirties fock and ivanenko [fock 1929] did very important
work on the geometric relations behind the algebra introduced by dirac. de broglie
and his school developed a very valuable and complete picture of the dirac uid a ten-
sor description of the dirac eld and its hydrodynamics [yvon 1940, takabayasi 1957].

1

this reasoning has a revival in recent times because of the improved tool of cliord
algebra now available [rylov 1995].

but the historical development abandoned the attempt of trying to nd a geometric
and thereby tensorial description of the dirac eld. firstly there seemed to be a
tendency to concrete calculations which on the one hand were extremely successful and
on the other hand could be performed without an elaborated interpretation by applying
simply the rules of algebra, see discussion in [isham 1995]. furthermore, quantum
theory had (has?) to be interpreted within a statistical picture. it was simply out of the
imagination of that time to search for such an explanation or even to connect geometry
with spinor variables.

one has to wonder, but neither the physicists pauli and dirac nor the mathemati-
cians weyl, jordan, von neumann and others cited or seemed to have known substan-
tially the work of grassmann, cliord, klein, cayley, hamilton and other algebraists of
the 19th century. if some of their formulas and results were acknowledged the quater-
nions e.g. were well known to be isomorphic to pauli matrices this was done in a
technical sense. the geometric origin of hypercomplex number systems was unknown
or ignored and thus lost for a further development of the theory. one result of this
missed opportunity in the sense of dyson [dyson 1972] was the thereby obtained in-
terpretation of spinors, which became articial objects in an abstract spin space or an
inner spin space and had thusly no physical counterpart in the real world. however,
from a technical point of view, dropping the interpretation, there was an extraordinary
and fruitful development of spinor methods in physics.

the situation changes with the appearance of the writings of david hestenes [hestenes 1966],

see references in [hestenes 1995]. he recovered again the geometric origin of spinor ob-
jects and the formerly well known connection of (metric) space and certain algebras.
the rst time he gave a geometrical motivated treatment of real dirac theory in his
book space time algebra [hestenes 1966]. the reformulation of diracs theory in
real(!) space time algebra c(r4, ),  = diag(1,1,1,1) is the starting point of a
host of new insights into the interplay between geometry, algebra and physics. hestenes
reformulation was also the very rst starting point of daviaus consideration which lead
to a space algebraic ( c(r3, )),  = diag(1, 1, 1) formulation of dirac theory.
but even up to now, there is a discussion on the proper interpretation of spino-
rial objects in either geometrical or statistical settings. this lead to a large number
of slightly dierent notations of spinors; e.g. spinor modules sx  c2n
x , operator or
hestenes spinors  c+
p,q, ideal spinors  cf , f an primitive idempotent element, al-
gebraic spinors and the spin cliord bundle isomorphism classes of ideal spinors to
geometrically equivalent idempotents etc. if cliord algebra provides us the univer-
sal language for mathematics and physics [hestenes 1985] we have to give exact and
unambiguous notations of physical objects and of their exact mathematical design.

non-geometrical i = 1 into the right action of 21 recall (21)2 = 2
12

hestenes in succeeding to write down a real dirac theory within c1,3 translated the
2 = 1.
but right actions mix dierent left ideals related to dierent idempotents, while left
action remains in the same left ideal. rodrigues et al.
introduced therefore the spin
cliord bundle and algebraic spinors, in which spinors or even better algebraic spinors
are dened to be equivalence classes of ideals which belong to geometrically equivalent
idempotents [rodrigues et al. 1996]. such idempotents are conjugated to one another
within the cliordlipschitz group  by e = ueu, u  , the reversion map, and are
therefore members of the same group orbit. to obtain a mathematical clear picture
one should then translate the dirachestenes spinors into the quotient space dh 
c1,3/ (as linear space) to be not troubled with the probably ill chosen representants.
this consideration should, however, be compared with the approach of parra to dirac
hestenes spinors and his illuminating explanation of the equivalence classes and their
relations to the wigner denition of a particle as an irreducible representation of the
poincare group [parra].

2

in this paper, we want to study the map from ordinary dirac matrix theory onto
space cliord algebra used by daviau. this will be done in several steps. starting
with the denition of the daviau map, we analyse afterwards the hestenes formula-
tion of dirac theory. then it is shown, that a special option of parras formulation
corresponds directly to hestenes formulation, showing the well known correspondence
between them. finally the equivalence of hestenes, sic. parras, formulation to the
space cliord algebraic formulation of daviau is demonstrated. the correct identica-
tion to parras options is given.

we can however not appreciate every work concerned with space cliord algebraic
formulations of dirac theory for lack of space, one importand paper may be added here
for those [baylis 1997].

our analysis unmasks a close connection between the ordinary spinor modul sx  c4
which is equivalent to a formulation by ideal spinors in c4,1, since c4,1 = m4(c) which
is actually used by physicists. daviaus map furthermore shows up a correspondence
of left actions on c4
x spinors to homomorphisms of p, which can be written as uxv,
u, v, x  p. if one denes the enveloping algebra p e as in hahn [hahn 1994], p e =
p  p t , where p t denotes the right module or transposed module, it is easily seen,
that the p e left action is equivalent to the p-bi-module structure by writing p e  p 7
p, x  yt  z = xyz. we have therefore to consider left and right actions on p,
as daviau did. this makes p a p-bi-module. this bi-module structure is crucial
for further investigations of the enveloping algebra p e of cliord algebras, which will
be given elsewhere, and for a thoughtful interpretation of left and right actions in
cliord algebras. there is a widespread thinking about the meaning of right actions,
see [hestenes 1967, daviau 1998b, fauser et al. 1999c].

2 the daviau map  : c4 7 c3,0

2.1 denition of the daviau map

daviau changed his notation and got rid of his cyclic permuted -matrices in a new
work [daviau 1998a], however, we stay with his old notations to be coherent.

we start according to daviau with the dirac equation in its standard matrix repre-

sentation due to bjorken & drell [bjorken et al. 1964]

i + qa + m = 0.

we have m, q real constants, i = 1 the usual complex unit,  := /x the partial

derivatives with respect to a local holonom coordinate system, a real components of an
external vector potential,  is the dirac spinor of c4 valued functions of the (tangent)
minkowski space and nally  the dirac matrices in dirac representation

it is an easy task, to translate the dirac equation into a set of eight real coupled
dierential equations, see also [parra 1989]. from a mathematical point of view, this
two sets of equations are identical. but in setting

(3)

with a, . . . , h : (m, ) 7 r real valued functions, one does no longer insist on the
spinorial character of the object in favour for playing with components and forgetting
about transformation properties  compare the analysis of parra [parra, parra 1989].

on the other hand, one has to consider the pauli algebra or space cliord algebra
c3,0  p. this algebra is isomorphic to the full matrix algebra m2(c) and thus eight
dimensional over the reals. a purely dimensional comparison yields dimr  = 8 =
dimp = dimr m2(c).
x  co-ordinates
 m2(c) which is also a morphism of the algebraic structure. one could call such a
map a dirac-morphism.

the aim of the daviau map is to give an isomorphism from c4

now, by letting

u := a + ih,
1 := u + w,

v := f + ib,
2 := t + v,

w := c + ig,
3 := t  v,

t := d + ie
4 := u  w

d = (cid:18) 1 3

2 4 (cid:19)  m2(c)  p  c3,0,

we obtain a map  : c4 7 m2(c). introducing then (note our indexing)

a := a0 + ~a,

~ := 21 + 32 + 13
~a := a12 + a23 + a31

 := (cid:18) 4  2

i := 123,

[i, x] = 0 x  p,

(4)

(5)

we obtain the space cliord or pauli algebraic form of diracs equation due to daviau:

i1 = m + qa.

(6)

daviau showed, that all transformation properties and requirements are fullled within
this picture, making his map nally a dirac-morphism preserving the algebraic structure
of dirac theory. a lagrangian formulation is also possible. using the above given
representation of pauli matrices (2) one can reconstruct an algebraic expression of the
m2(c) matrix d. from (4) we nd

d = (cid:18) u + w t  v
u  w (cid:19)

t + v

= (cid:18) a + c + i(h + g) d  f + i(e  b)
d + f + i(e + b) a  c + i(h  g) (cid:19)
= a1l + d1 + b2 + c3 + ei1  f i2 + gi3 + hi.

(7)

this form of the daviau spinor will be used below to show the equivalence to other
formulations.

2.2 hestenes equation

we may further notice, that since dim c1,3 = 16 and dim c+
1,3 may also be
used as a target for a map h : c4 7 c+
1,3. this algebra c+, called even subalgebra,
consist of dirachestenes operator spinors and has in a natural manner a bimodul
structure under the action of even elements. with the above choice of names for the
real spinor components (3) we obtain the correspondence using ij := ij, i := i0,
i := 123 = 0123:

1,3 = 8, c+

h = a + b10 + c20 + d30 + e21 + f 23 + g13 + h0123.

= a + b1 + c2 + d3  f i1 + gi2 + ei3 + hi

(8)

4

where we have used the identities

i1 = i10 = 23,

i2 = i20 = 13,

i3 = i30 = 21

(9)

and anticipated the names of the variables in an appropriate manner to t into the
daviau scheme. the translated dirac equation reads (m = m0c/, q = e/c,  =
, a = a)

h 21 = mh0 + qah ,

(10)

which is the famous dirachestenes equation and representation free. the elements
on the right hand side of h describe the spin bivector s := 21 and the particles
(local) velocity v := 0 a time-like vector measuring proper-time and do not x a
representation. for a discussion of the relation between quantum logic, measurement
and the choice of a time-like direction in dirac theory see [haft 1996, saller 1996].

now, we may left multiply (10) by 0 which turns the equation (beside the mass

term) into the space part of the algebra. using (9) and

we remain with

0 = 0 = 
0a = 0a = a

hi3 = m0h 0 + qah
h i3 = m
h + qah ,

(11)

(12)

which is written now within the space sector only. the transformation 
h = 0h 0
represents the hermitian adjoint, which is not an inner automorphism of the pauli
algebra isomorphic to c+

1,3, as indicated by the odd element 0.

this form of the dirac-hestenes formulation will be needed in the proof of the

isomorphy to daviaus formulation below.

2.3 parras analysis of dirac theory

parra analyzed the dirac equation also in terms of a real set of eight dierential equa-
tions [parra 1989]. like darwin and madelung he afterwards tried to reinterpret this
set of equations in terms of vector analysis, spinors versus multi-vectors [parra]. the
novelty of parras approach is, that he succeeded in formulating tensorial equations
without any complexication and thereby no doubling of degrees of freedom. this is
achieved by a simple inspection of the resulting eight real equations. under the assump-
tion, that the real part (1) of 1 rst component of the c4
x dirac spinor transforms
as a scalar quantity, the full set of eight equations admits a vectorial character. the
result is at rst not satisfactory since some terms remain to be only third components of
vectors. by introducing the spin vector ~n = (0, 0, ) (= is), one obtains a full so(3)
rotationally invariant set of vector equations. denoting the two scalar quantities as , 
and the two vectorial quantities as ~e = (e1, e2, e3), ~b = (b1, b2, b3) one arrives at
the parra type {0} spinor

{0} = 


 + ib3
b2 + ib1
e3 + i
e1 + ie2

.




(13)

now, it is purely a matter of choice which type of vector component scalar, rst, second
or third vector component one asserts for (1). the other three possibilities yield by

5

the same procedure, also introducing the spin-vector ~n, equally well suited spinortensor
translations. a suitable choice of names for the involved scalars and vectors yields:

{0} = 




{1} =

 + ib3
b2 + ib1
e3 + i
e1 + ie2
e1  ie2
e3 + i
b2 + ib1
  ib2






{2} = 




{3} =

b2 + ib1
  ib3
e1  ie2
e3 + i
e3 + i
e1 + ie2
 + ib3
b2 + ib1






.

(14)

if we now introduce a basis {ei} with cliord algebraic relations eiej + ejej = 2ij and
the above notations for m and q, one obtains four dierent equations:

{2}
{2}e21 + qa{2} + m{2}e0 = 0
{0} {0}e21 + qa{0} + m{0}e0 = 0
{3}
{3}e21  qa{3} + m{3}e0 = 0
{1} {1}e21  qa{1} + m{1}e0 = 0

e+

e+

e

e
 .

(15)

in the second column we give the identication due to parra with particles as-
sociated with the corresponding equations.  indicates electron or positron where 
indicates spin up or down this is a choice, one might exchange the meanings. the sec-
ond of these equations parra option {2} happens to be the dirac-hestenes equation
(10) if we identify the {ei} and {} bases, which thereby includes the spin explicitly.
the other three equations are new. even if they are similar in structure one is not able
to remove the relative changes in sign if two or more of these equations are considered
at the same time. once more, we see the right action of the spin-bivector e21 and of
the velocity vector e0. one should note, that proceeding from dirac theory to quan-
tum electrodynamics (qed), it became necessary to introduce particle and antiparticle
creation and annihilation operators for each spin polarisation. while in qed the for-
malism takes care of the dierent types of spinors, a simple complex linear combination
as quite common in dirac matrix theory! intermingles the dierent parra options
without any chance to re-obtain them as dierent equations.

the parra spinors can easily be put within a quaternion basis. let 1, ik := iek be
r + iq2
r where  means
1,3  c1,3  m2(h),

a quaternion basis, then the spinors of r-option become r = q1
quaternion conjugation. since hestenes spinors are elements of c+
this can be extended to matrix spinors

{r} = (cid:18) q1

r q2
r
q1
q2
r

r (cid:19) .

(16)

the 2  2 matrix structure is a matrix representation of the complex structure (1, i).
since the hestenes equation is formulated within abstract algebra and not within a
representation it is trivially representation independent. but a change of bases has to
be not only an algebra isomorphism but moreover a cliord algebra isomorphism. only
elements of the cliord-lipschitz group 1,3 induce such transformations. denoting
the group of even such elements as +
1,3 to be
exactly the discrete group of transformations which connect the parra options. such
transformations are beside the identity space inversion, charge conjugation and time
reversal.

1,3, we expect the quotient d = 1,3/+

we would thus submit, that the spin cliord bundle dened by rodrigues et al.
[rodrigues et al. 1996] is a slightly to large structure, since it does not properly distin-
guish the dierent particle types of parra. the spin-particle cliord bundle should
consist of equivalence classes of idempotents with respect to an even geometrical equiv-
alence relation. the commutator relation and thus the cliord structure can be seen

6

to be invariant under discrete or more generally odd transformation of the cliord-
lipschitz group [crumeyrolle 1990].

since we have thus established the equivalence of parras equations and the spin
cliord bundle in essence to the hestenes formulation, we concentrate now on the
connection of hestenes and daviaus space cliord algebraic formulations. the daviau
space cliord algebra form of diracs equation will correspond directly to parra option
{1} as will be shown below.

2.4 equivalence of space cliord and hestenes formulation

we will calculate the action of the outer automorphism within the even algebra. there-
fore we compare the 0 action with the action of  introduced in (5) on the daviau
spinor (4). observe the relation:

d = 2 d2


= (cid:18) a  c + i(g  h) d  f + i(e + b)
f  d + i(b  e) a + c + i(h  g) (cid:19)
= a1l  d1  b2  c3 + ei1  f i2 + gi3  hi.

(17)

now, let us use the injection i 7 i  1l, which gives a 4 4 representation of the space
cliord algebra, we are able to introduce a 0 in this representation, thereby identifying
 and  elements. however, this is no longer an element of the space cliord algebra.
we can calculate

0

d0 = a1l + d1 + b2 + c3 + ei1  f i2 + gi3 + hi

= d,

by comparing with (4). this might be rewritten as


d = 0d0

(18)

(19)

and used in the rewriting of the dirac-hestenes equation (12) which then yields the
pauli or space cliord algebraic equation

h i3 = m

h + qah .

(20)

to obtain the full equivalence between this formulation of the dirac-hestenes theory to
the space cliord algebraic version of daviau, we have to perform two further steps.

the rst is to explain the additionally minus sign in front of the mass term. re-
dening the sign of charge and angular momentum measurement, i.e. e 7 e,  7 ,
results in the appropriate change. of course, from a particle point of view this two
particles are not identical. they have a relation as a spin up electron to a spin down
positron and do correspond to dierent types of parra options in rewriting hestenes
theory [parra 1989]. since no weak interactions are involved here, one can physically
not distinguish these options and there is no harm in this settings. however, one should
note that daviau got four dierent equations within his calculations, and there may be
the chance that one of them t exactly to hestenes theory without changing the sign of
the mass term.

the second step is a relabelling of base elements in a cyclic way. this can be done

by dening

z

:  7 
z(1l) = 1l
z(i) = i1

7

cyclic.

(21)

the map z can be extended as an outer-morphism, that is a grade preserving extension
[hestens et al. 1984], to the whole algebra by setting z(ij ) = z(i)z(j ) etc. since
z is a cyclic permutation, we have z3 = 1 and z1 = z2. it is crucial to note, that
even if in the denition of the  morphism in (5) via complex conjugation followed
by a transformation with 2,  is not inner, it commutes with z. that is we have
z() = z().
we obtain the following isomorphism noticing from (7) and (8) that z1(h) = d

holds:

hi3 = m

h + qah

acting by m 7 m and z1 results in

(00 + 21 + 32 + 13)di1 =

m

d + q(0a0 + 2a1 + 3a2 + 1a3)d

which results with (5) in

di1 = m

d + qad.

(22)

(23)

(24)

this proves the equivalence of daviaus space cliord algebraic and hestenes formula-
tion of diracs theory.

3 related work

there seems to be a notorious revival of the transition between spinor and tensor de-
scriptions of dirac theory. as we mentioned darwin and madelung, there are far more
also recent such approaches of which we will mention only two more. based on ideas of
sallhofer [sallhofer 1991], simulik et al. [simulik et al. 1998] used extensively a spinor
tensor transition, called there maxwelldirac isomorphism, in applications and some
theoretical investigations. since their formalism is a restriction of the approach devel-
oped by parra, however not so detailed and pedagogical, we have nothing more to prove
there. our preference is however not intended to provide any priority claims.

a detailed thoughtful description of geometric electron theory with many citations

and critical remarks can be found in keller [keller 1993].

a further genuine and important approach to the spinor-tensor transition was devel-
oped starting probably with crawford by p. lounesto, [lounesto 1997] and references
there. he investigated the question, how a spinor eld can be reconstructed from known
tensor densities. the major characterization is derived, using fierz-konk identities,
from elements called boomerangs because they are able to come back to the spinorial
picture. lounestos result is a characterization of spinors based on multi-vector relations
which unveils a new unknown type of spinor.

however, we want to submit, that even the notion of a multi-vector is quite question-
able in dirac theory [fauser 1998] and in general [fauser 1999d]. the zn-grading used
to dene multi-vectors is not a feature of cliord algebra. one expects very dierent
spinor structures if dierent zn-gradings are properly implemented [fauser et al. 1999b,
fauser 1997].

4 conclusion

in this paper we discussed the isomorphism between spinor and multi-vector formula-
tion of dirac theory. we proved the equivalence of daviaus space cliord algebraic
and hestenes operator spinor formulations of dirac theory as their equivalence to dif-
ferent special options of parras treatment. the important observation is, that in usual

8

formulations the spinor representations are made up from left actions, while daviaus
formulation requires the bi-module structure of left and right actions. a detailed math-
ematical analysis of this fact will be given elsewhere [fauser 1999a]. regarding iso-spin,
which was sometimes introduced as right action, our analysis shows that one should be
very careful in doing so.

a further remarkable fact is that the daviau spinor is of the most general form 
most general element in the algebra and utilizes the full pauli algebra as representation
space. this should be compared with the hestenes even operator spinors and ideal or
column spinors which span the representation space but not the algebra itself.
it is
peculiar at this point carefully to distinguish representations and abstract algebra. in
this sense, daviaus formulation is the most compact formulation which can be found.
however, we gave some references which critically discussed the concept of multi-
vectors or zn-gradings in cliord algebras. one knows that dierent zn-gradings can
produce quite dierent spinor modules. this fact renders the unquestioned multi-vector
structure as a peculiar one. a careful study of the representation theory and their
dependence on gradings in such cases is required.
