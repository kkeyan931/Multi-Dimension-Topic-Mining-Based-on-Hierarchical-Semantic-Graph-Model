(3) (4) (5) (6) (7) results write lagrangian density dkp free eld dened l = 2 m, = 0. (8) (9) moreover, choose 0 hermitian anti-hermitian equation also easily obtained applying hermitian conjugation equation (1). multiplying dkp equation left nd  = contracting result (cid:3) + m2 = 0 (10) (11) component satises kg equation, expected relativistic eld equation. summing equation (10) = 0 dkp equation multiplied left i0 get schrodinger like hamiltonian form wave equation 5 = h lorentz transformation x = x h = i(cid:2)i, 0(cid:3) + m0. = u () , u1u = , (12) (13) (14) (15) innitesimal transformations = + ( = ) obtain  u = 1 + 1 2 s, =  . (16) spin 0 spin 1 sectors theory selected general representation matrices set operators, shown reference . spin 0 sector operators p = (cid:0)0(cid:1)2(cid:0)1(cid:1)2(cid:0)2(cid:1)2(cid:0)3(cid:1)2 , satises p 2 = p , p = p . shown p = p , p = 0, (17) (18) (19) and, consequence, innitesimal lorentz transformations (16) p u = p , (20) p transforms (pseudo)scalar. similarly p u = p + p , showing p transforms like (pseudo)vector. applying operators dkp equation (1) (p ) = p , p = (p ) , combined provide 6 (21) (22) (23) (p ) + m2 (p ) = (cid:3) (p ) + m2 (p ) = 0. (24) results show elements column matrix p scalar elds mass obeying kg equation elements p times derivative respect x corresponding elements p . then, acting p upon selects spin 0 sector dkp theory, making explicitly clear describes scalar particle. now, spin 1 sector operators r = (1)2 (2)2 (3)2 0; 6= 0 (1)2 (2)2 (3)2(cid:16)1 (0)2(cid:17) ; = 0 ; written compactly r = (cid:0)1(cid:1)2(cid:0)2(cid:1)2(cid:0)3(cid:1)2(cid:2)0 0(cid:3) ; r = r. (25) (26) (27) denitions following properties r = r, r = r r, rs = r r, rs = r r r + r. 7 (28) (29) (30) (31) results allow us show innitesimal lorentz transforma- tions ru = r + r, (32) see r transforms like (pseudo)vector r transforms like (pseudo)tensor since ru = r + r + r. application operators dkp equation results (r) = r, r = u , u = r r (33) (34) (35) (36) strength tensor massive vector eld r. combined, results provide (cid:18) u (cid:19) = r u + m2r = 0, (37) (38) 8 (39) equivalently (cid:0)(cid:3) + m2(cid:1) r = 0; r = 0. so, elements column matrix r components vector elds mass obeying proca equation; elements r equal times eld strength tensor vector eld corresponding elements r components. so, similarly spin 0 case, procedure selects spin 1 content dkp theory, making explicitly clear describes massive vectorial particle. moreover, spin 0 case, choose 5 degree irreducible represen- tation matrices way p = p ; p = representation 0 = ; 1 = 0 1 2 3 4 = 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ( = 0, ..., 3) .

(42) 2 = ; 3 = 0 0 0 0 use specic representation. so, equation (23) (40) result (for = 0, 1, 2, 3) 9 make = (4) . 4 = m, scalar eld, obtaining consequently = = im p = 041 , p = 041 , (cid:3) + m2 = 0. (43) (44) (45) (46) (47) call expression (46) physical form dkp eld. use representation matrices, together physical form , dkp lagrangian (8) get l = 1 2 ((cid:3) + (cid:3)) m2, (48) integrated parts giving result, except four-divergence term, usual kg lagrangian l = m2. (49) similarly, case spin 1 particles, 10 degree irreducible representation matrices found rst four components eld 10 components four vector b, selected r. 6 components 6 independent components strength tensor b. components selected r apply operators equation (38) becomes proca equation eld b. anyway, make use specic representation mention possibility sake completness without working complete calculations. 3 local gauge invariance interaction la- grangian one interacts dkp eld electromagnetic eld, close attention must taken interpreting physical content theory. performing minimal coupling dkp lagrangian obtain interaction term li = ea, (50) that, regain interaction term kg theory, one may tempted use expression (46) interaction term above, getting result li = iea ( () ) , (51) is, linear term dierent quadratic term obtained kg la- grangian. result gave rise interpretation dkp kg theories equivalent free eld case. intention show dierence arises incorrect use physical form dkp eld (46) situation longer valid, since obtained free elds, case anymore. first all, easily see expression (46) physical form incompatible gauge invariance. comes fact that, local gauge transformations, must = eie(x); = eie(x), 11 (52) dkp kg elds, respectively. using transformation property expression (46) physical form results = im = im (cid:0)ieeie(x) (x) + eie(x)(cid:1) eie(x)m 6= eie(x), (53) becomes obvious expression obtained free eld case longer valid. solution problem would simply change physical form given equation (46) = imd , (54) = iea, obviously transforms necessary keep compatibility transformations equation (52). this, easily show change expression physical form arises naturally analyse dkp lagrangian minimal coupling, showing explicitly direct application equation (46) case mistake. indeed, starting dkp lagrangian (8) perform minimal coupling obtaining result l = 2 (cid:0)d d(cid:0)(cid:1) (cid:1) m, l = 2 + ea, (55) (56) obtain minimally coupled dkp equation applying operators p p obtain (id m) = 0. (p ) = p p = (p ) , dd (p ) + m2 (p ) = 0. 12 (57) (58) (59) (60) shows elements column matrix p scalar elds mass obeying kg equation minimal coupling, elements p times covariant derivatives corresponding elements p . following exactly steps using representation matrices used obtain expression (46) free eld case, see correct physical form electromagnetic interaction given equation (54). besides that, p = 041 , p = 041 , dd + m2 = 0. (61) furthermore, regain kg interaction lagrangian enough use expression (54) dkp interaction term (50), must consider whole dkp lagrangian since covariant derivatives components and, consequently, spread interaction terms throughout whole dkp lagrangian. so, must substitute expression (54) complete minimally coupled dkp lagrangian given expression (55) (56). results l = 1 2 (cid:0)d + d(cid:1)+ie 1 2 ( )+e2aam2, (62) 13 l = 1 2 (cid:0)d + d(cid:1) + ie 1 2 ( ) + e2aa m2, (63) l = + iea ( ) + e2aa m2, (64) integration parts performed rst term equation (62). exactly usual kg lagrangian minimal coupling obtain correct interaction term li = iea ( ) + e2aa. (65) thus see that, using correct physical form dkp eld minimal coupling case, recover kg lagrangian correct min- imal coupling interaction term. consequently, equivalence theories kept electromagnetic interaction comes play. apparent dierence reported literature comes use physical form dkp eld, obtained free case, longer valid presence electro- magnetic eld incompatible requirement local gauge invariance. 4 physical components anomalous terms analyse presence apparently anomalous term lacking phys- ical interpretation hamiltonian second order forms minimally coupled dkp theory. forms obtained starting dkp equation minimal coupling, equation (57), contracting left d, results idd md = 0. (66) 14 algebraic calculation expression reduces = + e 2m f ( + ) , (67) relation  = ief used. making = 0 last expression d0 (cid:0)0(cid:1)2 d0 i0di e 2m f(cid:0)0 + 0(cid:1) = 0, multiplying equation (57) left i0 results (cid:0)0(cid:1)2 d0 + 0idi + im0 = 0. (68) (69) then, summing equations get hamiltonian (schrodinger like) form dkp wave equation = h, h = i(cid:2)i, 0(cid:3) di + e 2m f(cid:0)0 + 0(cid:1) ea0 + m0. (70) (71) finally, contracting equation (67) get result second order wave equation dd + m2 2 efs e 2m ( + ) (f) = 0. (72) anomalous term one proportional e/2m equations (67) (72) hamiltonian (71). denomination due fact, already noticed kemmer original work , apparent physical interpretation, contrary others terms equations, physi- cal interpretations analogous similar terms obtained working dirac equation. 15 recently nowakowski  settled question showing mentioned term physical meaning simply disapears one works physical components dkp eld. done use specic choice 10 10 5 5 representations dkp algebra. intention show result easily obtained representation algebra (it even necessary irreducible one) use operators, dened section 2, select spin 0 spin 1 sectors theory choice matrices satisfying dkp algebra. first, case spin 0 sector theory, apply operator p dened equation (17) second order equation (72) obtaining dd (p ) + m2 (p ) 2 efp e 2m p ( + ) (f) = 0 dd (p ) + m2 (p ) e 2m (p + p ) (f) = 0 dd (p ) + m2 (p ) = 0, (73) (74) (75) used equations (18) (19). see select spin 0 sector p anomalous term vanishes. this, spin-eld interaction term  fs also vanishes, scalar eld. applying p equation get result covariant derivative kg equation (75), must remember relations p p given equations (58) (59) equations (22) (23) obtained free eld case. analogously, using p p equations (67) (70) obtain trivial equalities regain kg equation (75). moreover, shows solutions second order equation (72) always solutions rst order dkp equation. so, good analog diracs second order equation. also shows (72) one among class second order equations obtained dkp equation. now, order analyse spin 1 sector, must derive relation r r presence minimal coupling, way done previous section operators p p . so, apply operators dkp equation minimal coupling, equation (57), obtaining 16 (r) = (r) , (r) = u i, u = dr dr, (76) (77) (78) covariant stress tensor massive vector eld r interacting minimally electromagnetic eld. tensor written explicitly u = u ie (ar ar) . (79) interesting mention combining results minimally coupled proca equation d(cid:0)u i(cid:1) + m2 (r) = 0. now, apply operator r equation (72) get ddr + m2r efrs 2 e 2m (cid:0)r + r(cid:1) (f) = 0, (80) (81) shown reduce, algebraic manipulation, min- imally coupled proca equation (80). apply operator r second order equation (72) simply regain u denition, equation (79). 17 similar results follow others equations: regain denitions get trivial identities. example, applying r equation (67) result dr = ie 2m2 fu i, (82) f usual stress tensor electromagnetic eld a. result obtained directly covariant derivative proca equation (80). important result select physical components dkp eld anomalous term eliminated, physical meaning. and, mentioned before, result dependent upon specic choice matrices degree representation, quite general. 5 conclusions comments work discussed two points relative minimal electromagnetic coupling dkp theory usually understood literature correctly. first showed reported dierence interaction term scalar bosons spin 0 dkp theory kg theory exist. apparent dierence showed caused incorrect use expression physical form dkp eld valid free eld case, minimally coupled case. correct physical form presence electromagnetic interaction used, nd dierence interaction terms theories. also shown gauge invariance principle shows clearly origin problem since free eld physical form incompatible gauge invariance: changing expression physical form necessary keep gauge invariance. moreover, correct expression easily obtained using dkp lagrangian minimal coupling, minimally coupled dkp equation, projectors physical components convenient choice 18 matrices (the used free eld case). addition showed apparently anomalous term second order hamiltonian forms dkp equation disappears select physical components dkp eld, term physical meaning. con- clusion exactly presented nowakowski  but, seems us, obtained clear becoming way. furthermore, use operators select spin 0 1 sectors theory demand choice specic representation matrices. finally, also interest- ing notice that, project physical components dkp eld, second order equation (72) reduced well known second order equations scalar vector elds, i.e. klein-gordon proca equations. 6 acknowlegdments j.t.l. b.m.p. would like thank capess picdt program cnpq, respectively, partial support. r.g.t. j.s.v. thank capes fapesp (grant 98/00268-1), respectively, full support.
