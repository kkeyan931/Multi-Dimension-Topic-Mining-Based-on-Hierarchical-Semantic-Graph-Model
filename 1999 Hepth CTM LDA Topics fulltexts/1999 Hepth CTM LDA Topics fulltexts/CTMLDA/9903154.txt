(5) work conformal gauge h00 = 1 h11 = 1, canonical transformation becomes equivalent following nonlocal map : = b0x + ( g00 + g0x). (6) 3 3 -model kaluza-klein metric (pole solution) 3.1 model section consider -model metric target manifold kaluza-klein metric u(1) isometry. hence metric : ds2 = gabdx adx b = gdxdx + r2(dy + ka r dx)2. (7) xa = {y, x}, = 0, 1, 2, 3, 5 , = 0, 1, 2, 3. metric given (7) also written as: (8) gab = g + k2aa kra kra ! . r2 considered abelian kaluza-klein theory electromagnetic gauge eld, x g coordinates metric four dimensional space-time respec- tively. constant k introduced order ka becomes dimensionless. also taken extra fth dimension circle radius r angular variable coor- dinate. denition kaluza-klein metric given (7) terms dimensional world-line dimensionally consistent. notice gauge eld metric g independent y, hence fth coordinate isometry one. indeed kaluza-klein metric (7) metric u(1) principal bundle. actually, section taken target manifold -model u(1) principal bundle. according formula (1), action model conformal gauge vanishing torsion written as: variation leads following euler-lagrange equation: = 1 4 z d2gabx ax b. (gabx b) 1 2 agbcx bx c = 0. gab independent fth coordinate y, therefore = 5 case leads to: = 0, = g5bx b. (9) (10) (11) conservation law due isometry, use explicit form kaluza-klein metric (8), relation interpreted continuity relation. see below, obtained via noether theorem. using explicit form kaluza-klein metric (8), equation motion (10) = components written as: (gx) 1 2 gxx = k r afx, (12) f = electromagnetic eld intensity. equation two dimensional -model presence electromagnetic eld. let us consider following solitonic solution equation (10): = + , x = x( ), (13) 4 coordinate = ( 0, 1) world sheet = (,), 0 2; appears dimensional consistency (we working natural system units); arbitrary integer constant. ansatz also proposed reference , important points deserve much attention. going deal -model, hence h intrinsic metric diers drastically metric induced via embedding two dimensional world sheet target manifold m. therefore, contrary reference , contradiction choice h conformal metric. now, using ansatz (13) equations (12) (11), get: = kra x + r2 = const, (g x) 1 2 g x x = k r f x. = mr2 (14) (15) geodesic equation charged point particle curved space- time metric g, within presence electromagnetic eld a. now, assume gauge eld monopole located origin (consistent fact monopole solitonic solution dimensional einstein equation ), equation (15) interpreted equation motion point charged particle given curved space-time within presense magnetic monopole. order make subject clear, investigate hamiltonian system. hence write action (9) terms space-time metric gauge eld as: = 1 4 z d2. using ansatz (13), get following form momentum density: = 1 2 , 5 = 2 . (16) (17) also, substituting ansatz (13) action (16) get following action point particle integrating 1: = 1 2 z . hence, x = g(p kar a), p momentum soliton. finally, hamiltonian system get: 2 h = g(p qea)(p qea) + ( m2r2 2 + q2 2k2 e qer k ), qe, charge soliton, dened as: qe = kar . 5 (18) (19) (20) (21) clear formula (20) hamiltonian system depends integer m. also, equations (15) (20) see mass soliton = 1 . hand, hamiltonain bounded |qe|, one characters solitonic solution. moreover, expected kaluza-klein theory, fth momentum p5 proportional charge soliton: p5 = z 2 0 5d = , k r p5. qe = (22) therefore, charge quantization follows quantization fth momentum com- pactness fth coordinate: p5 = n r , k r2 n, qe = (23) n integer number. proceeding investigation dual model derive topological noether currents model itself. order obtain topological charge consider following topological current: hence, topological charge dened as: j top = r2 k y. qtop = z 2 0 j 0 topd 1 = 2mr2 k . (24) (25) similar magnetic charge monopole. see this, consider chern number u(1) principal bundle: g = zc da st r2 k z dy = qtop. (26) note using stokes theorem assumed approaches exact form boundary region surface integration. now, using relations (23) (25), obtain well-known diracs quantization: qe.qtop = 2mn. (27) order obtain noether current investigate symmetry action (16). already seen action isometry symmetry, invariant trans- formation + adapted coordinate. therefore, according noether theorem obtain following conserved current: j = 0, j = k r  (28) relation (11). obtain charge qe integrating j 0. 6 3.2 dual model using transformation (4) obtain dual model. writing transformation relations one careful. example, metric gab torsion potential bab chosen dimensionless section two, terms action (16) dimension length. hence, must take account coecient 1 sake dimensional consistency. also, note relation (16) isometry fth dimension, hence relation (2) index 0 plays role 5 relation (16). taking account facts, coecients gab bab dual model written as: g55 = r2 , b5 = k r a, g5 = 0, g = g/, b = 0. (29) using data get following action dual model: = 1 4 z d2.

(33) (34) (35) (36) comparing relations (34) (36) see buschers dual transformation in- terchanges electric magnetic charges. hence solitonic solutions kind (13) (31), t-duality transformation interchanges noether charge following equation motion topological charge associated bianchi identity; acts electric-magnetic transformation. also, note equations (34) (36) get: qn . qtop = qe.qtop (37) 4 -model kaluza-klein metric torsion term (dyonic solution) 4.1 model section consider -model kaluza-klein metric extra anti- symmetric term form: = 1 4 z d2. result, electromagnetic intensity eld dual written terms potentials: + 2kr ayx], f = a, f = a, 8 (39) f = 1 2f . already shown reference  non-locality potentials a, aects neither equation motion f dual f. action (38), metric g potentials a, assumed independent y. course, assumption compatible non-locality potentials. similar previous section, coordinate isometry. general, variation action (1) leads following equations motion:  1 2 a(gbc + bbc)x bx c = 0. (40) again, since gab bab action (38) independent coordinate y, get following equation = 5: = 0, = r2y + krax + kr ax, (41) whereas = component equation (40) takes form: (gx) 1 2 gxx = + k r k2 2 dfx + kr fyx (a f + 2 af)xx. now, similar previous section, consider following solitonic ansatz: = m, x = x( ). case, equation motion reduces to: = kra x = const, (g x) 1 2 g x x = ( kd r f + mkr f) x, (42) (43) (44) interpreted equation motion dyon space-time metric g presence electromagnetic eld f. similar previous section, see solitonic solution appear dyon, consider hamiltonian system: 2 h = a) + electric magnetic charges dyon dened as: a)(p qea qm g(p qea qm 2k2 (qe 2 + qm 2), (45) qe = kdr , qm = krm . (46) clear equation motion (44) dyon mass = 1 . also obvious hamiltonian (45) solitonic solution saturates bogomolnyi limit: dene fth momentum using relation (38) analogous previous section, obtain relation fth momentum electric charge dyon. proceed investigate solitonic solution dual model give physical interpretation. 2 + qm 2. (47) e qqe 9 4.2 dual model order obtain dual model use buschers transformation (4); coecients metric torsion terms chosen dimensionally consistent. hence, have: g55 = r2 , g5 = k r a, g = (g + k2 a)/, b = therefore, action dual model written as: b5 = k ra, k2 (a a). (48) (49) = 1 4 z d2. equation motion (40) provided replace isometry coordinate y, metric gab torsion bab dual isometry coordinate , dual metric gab dual torsion bab, respectively. thus, following solitonic solution similar (43): = m, x = x( ), (50) integer, equations motion become: = k r x = const, (g x) 1 2 g x x = (kr f + mk r f) x. (51) equations indicate even solitonic solution dual model dyonic behaviour. nd exact value electric magnetic charge, order investigate behaviour solitons, consider hamiltonian system: 2 h = a) + electric charge qe magnetic charge qm dyon as: a)(p qea qm g(p qea qm 2k2 ( q2 e + q2 ), qe = k r , qm = kr . (52) (53) again, dual hamiltonian (52), clear solitonic solution (50) saturates bogomolnyi limit: e q q2 e + q2 . 10 (54) order get relation model dual, compare equations (44) (45) duals (51) (52). see duality transformation (48) equivalent following one: a, r r consequently: m, qe qm , qm qe . (55) (56) now, using relation (6) solitonic solutions (50) (43), get following relations charges: qm = qm , qe = qe . (57) hence, duality transformation qe qm , electric-magnetic duality transformation. 5 conclusion saw torsionless -model kaluza-klein metric special solitonic ansatz reduced system described motion charged particle given curved back- ground manifold, strong coupling (t = 1 . also, investigating dual model shown usual abelian dual transformation interchanges noether charge obtained equation motion topological charge associated bianchi identity. also obtained results -model torsion term using non-local gauge potential. shown solitonic ansatz model reduced system describing motion dyon given curved background manifold, similary mass dyon = 1 . finally, saw abelian duality leads interchange electric magnetic charge dyon. words, special ansatz, t-duality interpreted electric-magnetic duality. 2 ) mass soliton = 1 acknowledgment wish thank dr. s.k.a. seyed yagoobi carefully reading article constructive comments.
