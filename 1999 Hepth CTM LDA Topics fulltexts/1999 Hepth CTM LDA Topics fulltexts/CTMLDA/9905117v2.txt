abstract

we perform the gaugexing of the theory of a chiral twoform bo-
son in six dimensions starting from the action given by pasti, sorokin
and tonin. we use the batalinvilkovisky formalism, introducing anti-
elds and writing down an extended action satisfying the classical master
equation. then we gaugex the three local symmetries of the extended
action in two dierent ways.

1 introduction

chiral bosons are antisymmetric tensors of rank 2n in 4n + 2 dimensions with
(anti)selfdual eld strengths. their description in terms of a manifestly lorentz-
covariant action has been a longstanding problem. the core of this problem is the
rst order selfduality condition. the absence of a lorentz covariant action makes
an analysis of quantum properties of these theories more cumbersome. in 6 dimen-
sions, the chiral boson is a (anti)selfdual twotensor. it appears in the worldvolume
action of the m5brane [1] or in 6dimensional chiral supergravity [2].

some proposals for lorentz invariant lagrangians involved squaring the second
class selfduality constraint [3] or introducing an innite tower of auxiliary elds
[4]. their quantum properties were studied in [4, 5]. the problem with the innite
tower of auxiliary elds of [4] is to nd a consistent truncation. this approach was
generalised to higher order forms in [6].

by giving up explicit lorentz invariance, it became possible to construct a new
class of actions [7, 8]. in [8], 6dimensional actions were constructed with manifest
5-dimensional lorentz symmetry. the proof of 6dimensional lorentz invariance
needed a non-trivial check.

by introducing one auxiliary scalar eld, lorentz covariant actions for chiral
pforms were constructed in [9, 10, 11, 12]. this auxiliary scalar eld appears
non-polynomially in the action and does not propagate. the action is invariant
under two new gauge symmetries that depend on this scalar. one of the gauge
symmetries makes it possible to gauge away this new auxiliary eld. the relation to
the approach with an innite number of lagrange multipliers [6] and the formulation
with manifest 5dimensional lorentz invariance [8] is explained in [9]. later, also -
symmetric, lorentz invariant worldvolume actions were constructed for the 5brane
of mtheory [10, 11, 13].

in this paper, we study the free selfdual twotensor in 6 dimensions in the
batalinvilkovisky (bv) formalism. this free action is superconformally invariant
and it is the gaugexed action of the symmetric m5brane worldvolume ac-
tion, restricted to quadratic terms, as proven in [13]. up to now, a description for
interacting tensor multiplets is lacking, although some attempts have been made
[14].

the bvformalism [15] is suited to study systems with dierent types of gauge
symmetry structures, e.g. reducible gauge algebras. the classical bvformalism
leads to a gaugexed action. the quantum bvformalism enables the calculation
of anomalies. here, we restrict ourselves to the classical analysis of the action of the
chiral 2form in 6 dimensions.

we start from the pasti-sorokin-tonin (pst) action [9]. we build an extended

1

action for the chiral tensor that satises the classical master equation. for this,
we have to introduce ghosts for the gauge symmetries and ghosts for ghosts for the
reducible symmetries.

using dierent canonical transformations, we nd gaugexed actions corre-
sponding to two gauge choices. the rst action is a new, fully covariant one, while
another gauge choice gives rise to the gaugexing of [8].

the paper is organised as follows. in section 2, a short review of the classical
part of the bvformalism is given.
in section 3, the extended action is built for
the selfdual 2tensor using the bvformalism. two possible gaugexings of this
extended action are given in section 4.

2 review of the batalinvilkovisky formalism

in this section we give a brief account of the classical bvprocedure. more elaborate
reviews can be found in [15]. we will emphasize the case where the gauge symmetries
of the classical action have zero modes, so that a second generation of ghosts will
have to be introduced. a ghost number g is assigned to the gth generation of
ghosts, where the classical elds have g = 0. for every eld, including the ghosts,
an antield with opposite statistics is introduced. we denote the physical and ghost
elds by a and their antield counterparts by 
a. the antields are assigned a
ghost number such that

(1)
we also dene an antield number, which is zero for elds and equal to g for
antields. for functionals f (, ), g(, ), we introduce the antibracket

a) = 1 .

g(a) + g(

(f, g) = f





a





a

g  f







a


a g,

(2)

where summation over a is understood. sometimes we will add to the antibracket
an index between brackets: (f, g)(n) means that in (2), only the terms with antield
number n are to be included.

the minimal extended action is dened by adding to the classical action a part
containing the antields, multiplied by the brst-transformations. the parameters
of the gauge transformations have been replaced by ghosts:

smin = scl + s1
= scl + 

ara

b cb,

(3)

where a = ra
b. the extra term has antield number 1.

b(c) b is the innitesimal gauge transformation with parameter

2

if the gauge transformations of scl have zero modes, extra terms have to be
introduced which have an analogous form: an antield which will be the antighost
of the relevant gauge transformation, multiplied by the zero mode transformation,
where the parameter has been replaced by a ghost for ghost. this yields a term of
antield number 2. an additional term of the same antield number is introduced
for the commutators of the gauge symmetries, of the form

z dx 1

2()bc

a t a

bc cbcc,

(4)

where the t a
bc are the structure functions associated to the commutators of the
gauge symmetries and ()b is the fermion number of ghost cb. other terms may
have to be added to the action until it satises the properness condition. this
essentially states that for every gauge symmetry a ghost has been introduced, and
for every zero mode a ghost for ghost. this can be checked by counting the number
of zero modes of the hessian

sa

b =




a s





b

(5)

at the stationary surface. this is the surface where the classical elds satisfy the
eld equations and the ghosts and antields are set to zero. the result should be
half the number of elds and antields.

more terms of higher antield number, s3, . . . , sn, are added until the resulting
action, called the extended action, satises the classical master equation, which is

(sext, sext) = 0.

(6)

the truncation of the extended action to the antieldindependent part should be
the classical action.

canonical transformations from the basis {a, 

a} are
dened to leave the antibrackets invariant. often they can be determined by a
fermionic generating function of ghost number 1, f (, ), such that

a} to another set { a, 

a =

f (, )

 
a

,



a =

f (, )

a

.

the generating function is of the form

f (, ) = a 

a + ().

(7)

(8)

the function , also a fermion of ghost number 1, is called the gauge fermion.

3

gaugexing is performed by canonical transformations on the set of elds and
antields, such that the antieldindependent part of the extended action has a
hessian that is invertible on the stationary surface. in that case, welldened prop-
agators can be calculated. to do the gaugexing, it will be necessary to introduce
auxiliary elds and their antields b and b. they should not have any inuence on
the master equation, and the physical content of the action should not be changed.
for example, one gives the eld b a ghost number 1, so that its antield has ghost
number zero, and one adds to the action the term snm = (b)2. fields with negative
ghost number are called nonminimal.

for each gauge invariance one introduces such a nonminimal eld bi, and gauge
cl are the classical elds. the gauge fermion is

xing functions fi(cl), where the a
then taken to be

 = bifi(cl).

(9)

one also has to take care of the zero modes of the gauge transformations. therefore,
one has to introduce new auxiliary elds, but since they will have to be fermionic,
it will be impossible to add a term (b)2 to the extended action. we will deal with
this problem as it arises.

this concludes our summary of the bvformalism. for justication of the state-
ments made here, and for further details, one should consult one of the references
[15].

3 the extended action for a chiral 2form

in this section, we rst give the notations of the sixdimensional pstaction, and
then build the extended action for the chiral 2form introducing ghosts and ghosts
for ghosts associated to the gauge symmetries and their zero modes. since we are
interested in studying the gauge symmetries of the chiral tensor, we will restrict the
action to the terms with the chiral twotensor and not consider the full supersym-
metric model.

3.1 the classical action and its symmetries

the supersymmetric classical action for the selfdual tensor multiplet in 6 at di-
mensions in the pstformalism [9, 13] is

scl = z d6x  1

2 (cid:16)x a(cid:17)2

the index a labels the 5 scalars x a.  denotes a doublet of chiral spinors. fur-
thermore a tensor bab and an auxiliary eld a are contained in the action. we will

(10)

conne ourselves to the study of the gauge symmetries in the rst term of (10). the
following notations are used:

u2 = uaua ,
habc = 3[abbc] ,

habc ,

h

where h 

abc =

h = db ,

where h

2(habc  h

this action has the following three gauge symmetries:

iibab = 2h 
ab

ibab = 2[ab] ,

u2
iiibab = u[ab] ,

,

ia = 0 ,

iia =  ,

iiia = 0 .

(11)

(12)

the rst symmetry is the usual gauge symmetry for a pform. the second and the
third symmetry are new symmetries, enabled by the introduction of the scalar eld
a. the rst and the third symmetries are reducible. they have 3 zero modes:

(a)
(b)
(c)

a = a ,
a = ua ,
a = ua , a = 2a .

(13)

3.2 the extended action of the chiral 2form

using the existence of the gauge symmetries and their reducibility conditions, we
will build the extended action of the chiral 2form. the rst step to achieve an
extended action is to introduce antields b 
ab and a for the classical elds, and
ghosts ca, c and c
b associated respectively to symmetries i, ii and iii. the ghost
number and statistics of the dierent elds and antields can be found in table 1.

the gauge symmetries yield the following contribution to the extended action at

antield number 1 as given by (3):

s1 = z d6x b ab(2acb + 2h

a contribution at antield number 2 comes from the ghosts for ghosts d1, d2 and
d3, associated to the 3 zero modes of the gauge symmetries (13). this gives

s2

1 = z d6x (c

a(ad1 + uad3) + c

a (uad2 + 2a)d3) ,

(15)

a and c

a are the antields associated to the ghosts ca and c

a. in s2, we also
where c
have to include a term related to the commutators of the symmetries as indicated
in (4). these commutators are

it is straightforward to check that the action

s = scl + s1 + s2,

with s2 = s2

1 + s2

2, satises the properness condition, i.e. that the hessian

(18)

(19)

(20)

at the stationary surface has a number of zero modes that is exactly half its dimen-
sion. to check it, it is convenient to choose a point on the surface where h 
abc = 0.
the number of zero modes of the hessian cannot vary along the stationary surface.

as far as antibrackets are concerned, one has

(scl, s1) = 0 .

6

(21)

this is simply a consequence of the gauge invariance of the classical action. how-
ever, the classical master equation is not yet satised; in particular, one has the
antibracket

since this is not 0, we have to add terms at antield number 3. the choice that

then

2(s2, s3)(2)  2(s1, s2)(2) + (s2, s2)(2) = 0
2(s1, s3)(3) + 2(s2, s3)(3) + (s3, s3)(3) = 0 .

(23)

(24)

we conclude that the sum of (10), (14), (15), (18) and (23) is a good extended
action. this action satises the classical master equation, the properness condition,
and the classical limit (deleting all terms with non-zero ghost number in the action)
gives the classical action (10). so, all the conditions to have a good extended action
are fullled.

4 gaugexings of the extended action

in this section, we present three dierent gaugexings. first, there is the gauge
xing that gives rise to the explicit selfduality condition of the 2form [9]. then a
covariant gaugexing of the extended action is given. by allowing the gradient of
the auxiliary scalar to point in an arbitrary direction, a noncovariant gaugexing,
as used in [8, 16], is found.

7

4.1 the selfduality of the twoform

the eld equation of the twoform bab is

lmnpqrn(

1
u2 uph 

qrsus) = 0 .

the most general solution of (25) is [9]

h 

lmnun = u2[lm] + un(n[l)um] + u[l(m]n)un,

(25)

(26)

lm = 0 is equivalent to h 

this is a gauge transformation iii of h 
lm. by using a schouten identity, it can be
proven that h 
lmn = 0. this means that it is possible to nd
the selfduality of bab by picking a gauge choice for the third gauge transformation.
so, the formulation with an auxiliary eld gives rise to the explicit selfduality
equation.

4.2 a covariant gaugexing

in this section we will present a covariant gaugexing of the extended action using
gauge fermions in the bvformalism. we start by gaugexing the three gauge
symmetries (12) of the classical action. we will use the gauges

abab = 0 ;
u2 = 1 ;
uabab = 0 .

(27)
(28)
(29)

(28) is a lorentz invariant gaugexing for symmetry ii. the gauge (29) xes sym-
metry iii and is the analogue of the lorentz gauge; using a transformation iii, one
can remove the component of bab that is parallel to the vector ua.

to facilitate the gaugexing of symmetry i, we rst rewrite the classical action

as

scl = z d6x( 1

24 h abchabc + 1

2h abh 

ab) .

(30)

for each of these gaugexings, one introduces a new nonminimal set of fermionic
elds and their antields and adds to the action a term quadratic in the antields.
in table 2, they are denoted by ba.

the gaugexing is done by introducing a gauge fermion for each symmetry:

1 = babbab
aubbab
2 = b
3 = b(u2  1) ,

and adding to the action the nonminimal terms

aba  1
snm1 =  1

a ba + b2 .

(34)

the gauge symmetries of the classical action also had three zero modes. their
gaugexing is done in general by introducing two extra sets of bosonic elds and
their antields for each zero mode. in the table 2 they are denoted by ba1 and ba1.
the arrow between them is used to indicate that one adds a nonminimal term to
the action which is a product of their antields.

for the gaugexing of the three reducible gauge symmetries, one introduces the

bosons k, m, p and l, n, q. the following gauge fermions can be used:

4 = kbcb + laba
5 = muaca + nuaba
6 = p(uaca  2aca) + q(uaba  2aba) .

to the action the following nonminimal terms are added:

snm2 = kl + 1

2mn + pq .

the antieldindependent part of the action becomes

(41)

this is a covariant gaugexed action for the selfdual 2form in 6 dimensions. in
principle this can be used to derive gravitational anomalies as in [16, 17], but the
presence of the auxiliary scalar in the propagators makes an analysis of anomalies
using this action very hard. the non-covariant gaugexing of the next section can
be used for this.

4.3 a noncovariant gaugexing

the noncovariant gaugexing of the second symmetry in this section corresponds
to a = x5 in [8]. in [16], the second gauge symmetry was xed by imposing a = naxa
where na is a unit vector such that u2 = 1. using the faddeevpopov approach, it
was proven that this gaugexing gives rise to the propagators postulated and used
in [17] to calculate the gravitational anomalies of a chiral 2form in 6 dimensions.

the second gauge symmetry can be xed by a canonical transformation that

cannot be generated by a gauge fermion:

a  b + naxa
a  b .

uc  cb + nc
u2  1  2naab + (b)2 .

this means that

using the gauge fermions

1 = babbab
anbbab
3 = b
4 = kbcb + lbbb
5 = mnaca + nnaba
6 = p (naca + 2aca) + q (naba + 2aba) ,

5 conclusions

in this article, we were able to nd the full extended action of the chiral twoform
in six dimensions using an auxiliary eld a. for this, we had to introduce ghosts
for the three gauge symmetries of the classical action and ghosts for ghosts for the
three zero modes and add corresponding terms to the classical action. we showed
that the expansion in antield number of the action satisfying the classical master
equation terminates at antield number 3. since this action satises the properness
condition and gives the classical action in the classical limit, it is a good extended
action.

we treated two dierent gaugexings, a non-covariant one as well as a covariant
one. we note in passing that the non-covariant gauge xing allows for an easy
counting of the onshell degrees of freedom: starting with 16 (15 for the tensor and
1 for the auxiliary scalar), one ends up with 3 degrees of freedom after successive
gaugexings of the three gauge symmetries.

the two gaugexing schemes were implemented within the bvformalism. the
rst one resulted in a fully lorentz covariant gaugexed action. these gaugexed
actions lead to dierent propagators that can be used in calculations of gravitational
anomalies. from the form of the actions we derived, it is clear that our second gauge
xing, also used in [16], is easiest because of the absence of the auxiliary eld a in
the propagators. however, in the bvformalism, a cohomology can be dened [15],
such that anomalies derived for dierent gaugexings (like the covariant one) are
in the same cohomology class.
