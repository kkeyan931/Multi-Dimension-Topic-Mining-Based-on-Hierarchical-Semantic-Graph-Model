abstract

the density of mass levels (m) and the critical temperature for strings in de sitter space-time
are found. qft and string theory in de sitter space are compared. a dual- transform is
introduced which relates classical to quantum string lengths, and more generally, qft and
string domains. interestingly, the string temperature in de sitter space turns out to be the
-dual transform of the qft-hawking-gibbons temperature.

the back reaction problem for strings in de sitter space is addressed selfconsistently in the
framework of the string analogue model (or thermodynamical approach), which is well suited
to combine qft and string study. we nd de sitter space-time is a self-consistent solution of
the semiclassical einstein equations in this framework. two branches for the scalar curvature
r() show up: a classical, low curvature solution (), and a quantum high curvature solution
(+), enterely sustained by the strings. there is a maximal value for the curvature rmax due to
the string back reaction.
interestingly, our dual relation manifests itself in the back reaction solutions: the () branch
is a classical phase for the geometry with intrinsic temperature given by the qft-hawking-
gibbons temperature. the (+) is a stringy phase for the geometry with temperature given by
the intrinsic string de sitter temperature. 2 + 1 dimensions are considered, but conclusions hold
generically in d dimensions.

1 introduction and results

in the context of quantum field theory in curved spacetime, de sitter spacetime has a hawking-
gibbons temperature given by

tds =

h

2kb

h =

hc

1

2kb

lds

(see ref.

[1] for its appropriated interpretation), h being the hubble constant, lds = ch1

being the classical horizon size.

in the context of string theory in curved spacetime, strings in de sitter spacetime have a maximal

or critical temperature given by

ts =

c3

kbh

string length scale.

(see section 3 in this paper for its appropriated derivation), ls  (cid:16) h

we introduce here a r- or dual -transformation over a length:

1

2 being a characteristic

ie, if l  lds, then:

l = rl = l2
r

l1

lds =

h
c2

h

lds is precisely the compton length of a particle whose mass is given by

mmax = (cid:18) c

h(cid:19)

this is the maximal mass for the spectrum of particle (oscillating or stable) string states in de

sitter spacetime ref. [2], [3] and [4].

the r -transfromation links classical lengths to quantum string lengths. (in de sitter spacetime,
it links the classical horizon size lds to the quantum string size in this spacetime. we are refering
here to the oscillatory or stable strings (those from which the quantum particle states derive)).

under the r -transformation (see section 3):

2

ts = 2 tds

the string temperature in de sitter spacetime turns out 2 times the dual (r -transformated)
of the hawking temperature (and conversely). that is, the intrinsic qft and string temperatures
in fact, this has a more general validity: the
in de sitter space are r -dual one of each other.
r -transform can maps qft and string domains (or regimes) and applies to other spacetimes as
well. in particular, it plays a key role when applied to black holes ref. [5].

in the context of qft, de sitter (as well as ads) spacetime, is an exact solution of the semiclas-
sical einstein equations with back reaction included ref. [6] and [7]. semiclassical in this context
means that quantum matter elds (including the graviton) are coupled to c-number gravity and the
vacuum expectation value of matter energy momentum tensor acts in turn as a source of gravity
(quantum back reaction eect).

in this paper we investigate the quantum back reaction eect of strings in de sitter spacetime.
in principle, this question should be properly addressed in the context of string field theory. on
the lack of a tractable framework for it, we work here in the framework of the string analogue model
(or thermodynamical approach): the string as a collection of elds n coupled to the classical back-
ground, and whose masses mn are given by the degenerate string mass spectrum in the curved space
considered. (the elds n are without self-interaction but are coupled to the classical geometry).
the elds n are repeated (m) times, the degeneracy of states being given by (m), the density
of mass levels of the string.

in at spacetime, the higher masses string spectrum is given by

( m)  maeb m , m  s c

h

m

(a and b being constants, depending on the model, and on the number of space dimensions).

in de sitter spacetime, we nd (m) is given by [eq. (33.b)]:

when h = 0, it yields the at spacetime asymptotic behaviour.

here we deal with 2 + 1 dimensions, but the results are the same for d dimensions, only the

numerical values of the constants will change.

for (iii), no real spacetime geometries, nor temperatures are possible.

two branches, (+) and (), for the curvature show up. the leading term is r in the () branch,
while is rmax in the (+) branch. in an expansion in r
, classical de sitter space is recovered in the
rmax
() branch. r() is a low curvature, classically allowed solution, while r(+) is a quantum branch
(it does not exists classically) and its curvature is very high. the quantum string back reaction
generates this branch.

our dual relation between classical-qft and the string domains manifests here again in the back
reaction solutions: the branch () is a classical phase for the geometry which temperature is given
by the qft hawking-gibbons temperature t () = tds = hc

the branch (+) is a stringy phase for the geometry which temperature is the intrinsic string de

moreover, our dual relation and the two phases: a classical-qft phase (with the hawking
temperature) and a quantum-string phase (with the string temperature), appear to be a generic
feature and are very enlighting for black holes. our study of the string black hole temperature and
quantum string back reaction for black holes is reported elsewhere ref. [5].

this paper is organized as folows: in section 2 we summarize de sitter spacetime and the qft
hawking-gibbons temperature. in section 3, we derive the string temperature in de sitter spacetime
and its dual-relation to the hawking-gibbons temperature. in section 4 we nd the quantum string
back reaction and its solution. in section 5 we present the concluding remarks.

2 de sitter space-time

de sitter space-time is a cosmological space with constant scalar curvature (r), and vanishing

spatial curvature index (k). its d-dimensional metric is given by

ds2 = c2dt2 + a2(t)(dr2 + r2d2
a(t) = eht

d2)

(1)

t being the cosmic time and h = d ln a(t)

dt

being the hubble constant.

de sitter space-time can be generated by a cosmological constant (). the curvature r, r, h

and  are related by

3 quantum strings in de sitter space-time

string theory in de sitter space-time is exactly integrable in any dimension ref. [10]. however,
explicit expressions for the string solutions are not easy to write due to the complexity of the equa-
tions, and even of the solutions. two main quantum frameworks have been studied and solved : (i)
canonical quantization of generic strings in any dimension ref. [2] and [3]; (ii) semiclassical quanti-
zation of exact circular strings congurations in 2 + 1 space-times ref. [4].

in this section we will consider the case (i) (canonical quantization). we remind now the reader

of some of the main issues [eq. (2)] and [eq. (3)].
in canonical quantization, one treats the de sitter classical background exactly, and considers the
string oscillations around its center of mass as perturbations. the string center of mass is an exact
solution of the geodesic equation. the perturbations (dimensionless) parameter is here

in this framework, the mass spectrum formula in de sitter space for an n  th level state is given

(11)

one of the consequences of the spectrum is that the number of string oscillating states, although

being very large, is nite. this maximum number is given by

nmax  int"0  15(cid:18) lds
ls (cid:19)

2# = int"0  15  c3

furthermore, there is a maximum mass (mmax) for the corresponding real mass solutions

ie

the fact that there is a maximum mass implies the existence of a maximum or critical tempera-
ture for the strings in de sitter space-time. the temperature ts corresponding to mmax [eq. (13)],
is given by

ts =

(14)

(15)

if we compare this maximal or critical temperature for strings in de sitter space-time (ts) with
the quantum eld theory hawking-gibbons temperature for de sitter space-time (tds) [eq. (6.a)],
we have

ts =   c3h

let us dene now the following transformation r over a length l

if lr = ls [eq. (10)], and we apply this transformation to l  lds [eq. (5)], we obtain

but lds is precisely the (reduced) compton wave length ( = h
mc ) of a particle whose mass is equal
ie lds is the minimal quantum length of a string in de sitter space.
to mmax given by [eq. (13)].
therefore, this transformation links the classical de sitter length scale lds to the quantum string-
de sitter one, lds.

the string temperature ts [eq. (15)] in de sitter space time can be rewritten in terms of lds

[eq. (18)] as

ts =

hc
kb

lds

(19)

we see now from [eq. (8)] and [eq. (19)] that the following relations hold under the r transfor-

mation

tds =

ts

ts = 2 tds

(20)

(21)

from the above equations we can read as well

ts tds = ts tds

that is, the maximal string temperature in de sitter spacetime is the dual (in the sense of the

r- transformation [eq. (17)]) of the hawking (qft) temperature.

4 quantum string back reaction in de sitter space-time

when quantum matter (particle elds, strings) is present in de sitter space-time, the relation be-
tween the scalar curvature and the cosmological constant  will be modied through the semiclassical
einstein equations. semiclassical in this context means that matter, which is a q-number, is coupled
to c-number gravity through the equations

r 

1
2

r g + g =

8g

c4

h(q, g)i

(22)

the space-time background metric g generates a non-zero vacuum expectation value of the energy
momentum tensor hi, which in turn acts as a source of curvature (for instance, in 4-dimensional
quantum field theory, matter elds  include the graviton and dt (cid:16) , g(cid:17)e is calculated up to
one loop order, where hti stands for its renormalized value ref. [11] and [7]).

for maximally symmetric (constant curvature) spaces (such as de sitter and anti de sitter), these

equations read

(cid:18)2  d

r + (cid:19) g =

(24.a)

(24.b)

(24.c)

which shows clearly quantum matter as a source of curvature and of temperature [eq. (7.b)].

as hi is proportional to g, de sitter (ds) (as well as anti de sitter (ads) backgrounds are

exact self consistent solutions to [eq. (22)] with back reaction included.

in de sitter space, there is one real parameter  family of de sitter group invariant vacua | >.
here hi is the expectation value in the bunch-davies ref. [8] and [9] (euclidean or ination-
ary) vacuum obtained for  = 0.

in order to study the back reaction problem for string theory in de sitter space-time, we will
work in the framework of the string analogue model, and in a 2 + 1 space-time, where we will use
the results coming from semiclassical quantization of exact circular strings congurations ref.
[4].
however, one should have in mind that the 2 + 1 string dynamics could be embedded in a higher
dimensional space-time and our results generalized to higher dimensions as well.

in the spirit of the analogue model, we consider here the string as a collection of elds n coupled
to the classical background, and whose masses mn are given by the degenerate mass spectrum of the
string. the elds n are free (without self interactions) but interact here with the classical geometry.
the (higher) mass spectrum is described by the density of mass levels (m). as it is known, in at
space-time (m) is given by

( m)  ma exp b m
where we have introduced the adimensional mass variable

m  s c

h

m

(25)

(26)

(which will prove useful later on.) the constants a and b depend on the string model and on the
dimensions of the space-time.

11

in de sitter space-time, (m) has a dierent behavior from the one of [eq. (25)], as it follows

from the string mass spectrum in de sitter space [eq. (11)].

it must be noticed that [eq. (30)] will provide a maximum string temperature similar to the one

of [eq. (14)].

[eq. (33.b)] generalizes to de sitter spacetime the standard at space time behaviour [eq. (25)].

we should have hn(m)i(m) where hn(m)i  r 0 kd2dk , but this divergent contribution cancels out

(as it appears as a multiplicative factor for both numerator and denominator).

since in de sitter space-time the number of particle oscillating states is nite, the sum goes up
to mmax [eq. (30)], (instead of up to innity as for minkowski space-time); m0 is the lower mass

14

from which the asymptotic expression of the density of mass levels [eq. (33)] is valid. therefore,
we are studying the back reaction eect in de sitter space-time due to the higher excited string modes.

here (m) [eq. (33)] depends only on the mass as usual, therefore ht 

 is will be chosen for our
study to be the expectation value of the stress tensor for a massive scalar eld (in the de sitter
invariant or bunch-davies vacuum).

for any odd dimensional de sitter space-time ref. [14]. in addition, for these spaces, ht

and no renormalisation procedure is needed, in contrast to the d = 4 case ref. [15].

at this point, let us analyse the mass scales in the corresponding quantum field theory (q.f.t.)
and string theory in de sitter space-time. from [eq. (32)] and [eq. (35)], one can read the following

now we express the above inequalities in terms of lds [eq. (5)] and lds , being the later the

( lr = (cid:16)5h
2c (cid:17)
2 , that appears here and in lds as well, is just
due to the slightly smaller mmax one obtains in semiclassical quantization, [eq. (30.a)], as compared
with the canonical quantization, [eq. (13)]. obviously, the action of the r transformation is equal
for both cases).

we can summarize the action of the r transformation, on the masses and on their domains, in

the following equations [eq. (37.a)], [eq. (37.b)], [eq. (40.a)] and [eq. (40.b)]

now we are able to write the v.e.v. of the stress tensor ht 

 is that appears in the r.h.s. of [eq.

domain study, it is clear that ht 

 is is precisely the r transformed object of ht

(42)

applying the r transformation [eq. (41.a)] and [eq. (41.c)] to ht

0 . in our case, the adimensional variable x runs in the interval [x1, 3

where x1 = m2
4) . about the
upper limit x2 , a word on f (x) is now in order. f (x) is a non-singular (monotonically) decreasing
function in the interval [0, 1], and f (x) > 0 for x in [0, 3
4) . but this later interval is in fact the safe
range for the physical validity of ht 
 iqft (the mass of the test particle m is much smaller than the
mass scale mh of de sitter universe), and hence for

ht 
 i .

on the other hand, if we consider the integral in in the numerator of [eq. (48)], the exponential of
(x) [eq. (45)] plays a leading role in the interval [x1, 3
4 ) from the physical point of view since 1  1
. therefore, the monotonically decreasing behavior of the function f (x) can be approximated by the
straight line y =  8

r is a small curvature solution. on the contrary, r+ does not represent a classical allowed congu-
ration and its curvature is very high. the two branches of solutions are generically of dierent kind.
we call the r branch classical as it represents solutions which are classically allowed, while the
r+ branch will be the quantum one as the congurations do not occur classically.

5 conclusions

combined study of qft and string theory in curved backgrounds allowed us to go further in the
understanding of quantum gravity eects.

the string analogue model (or thermodynamical approach) is a suitable framework in cosmology and
black holes to combine both qft and string study, and address the problem of quantum string back
reaction.

the dual relationship shown here between the two domains: classical-qft and quantum string,
applies also to other space-times and plays a key role in the black hole case ref. [5].

string black hole temperature and quantum string back reaction for black holes is reported in another
paper ref. [5]. the two phases correspond to the evaporation from a classical black hole geometry

22

with intrinsic temperature given by the qft hawking temperature to a string phase for the geome-
try (sustained by the quantum string back reaction) which temperature becomes the intrinsic string
temperature.

these studies and our dual relation between classical-qft and string phases appear irrespective of
conformal invariance.

similar study for anti de sitter space time is under investigation by these authors.

qft in anti de sitter space time does not possess an intrinsic or hawking temperature. strings
in ads space-time do not possess a maximal or critical temperature neither ref.
[3] and [4]. the
partition function for a gas of strings in ads space-time is dened at any positive temperature ref.
[3].

such results for strings in ads space-time were also conrmed in the presence of a full conformal
invariant ads string background wzwn model sl(2, r) (ads with torsion) ref.
[16]. as shown
in ref. [16] conformal invariance simplies the mathematics of the problem but the physics remain
mainly unchanged. for low and high masses, the string mass spectra in conformal and non conformal
backgrounds are the same.

the purpose of this paper was to go further in the understanding of string theory in de sitter
space-time. motivate (and at priory justify) the choice of de sitter space time: (i) the cosmological
(inationary) relevance of de sitter space-time, (ii) the present knowlodge of string dynamics in
conformal and non conformal invariant backgrounds, in particular in the conformal and non conformal
invariant ads backgrounds above mentioned, (iii) the lack, at the present time, of a full string
conformal invariant treatement involving de sitter space-time.
