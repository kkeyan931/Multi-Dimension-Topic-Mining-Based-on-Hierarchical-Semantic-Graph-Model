abstract

by means of the heterotic/type iib duality, we study properties of junctions
on backgrounds with a positively charged orientifold seven-plane and d-branes,
which are expected to give seven dimensional sp(r) gauge theories. we give a
modied bps condition for the junctions and show that it reproduces the adjoint
representation of the sp(r) group.

1 introduction

recent years the string theories have been bringing us a lot of information on non-perturbative

properties of various gauge theories. in the context of the string theories, gauge theories are
described as theories on branes. among several ways to realize four dimensional eld theories
by brane congurations, in this paper, we shall focus on the construction with d3-brane

probes on 7-brane backgrounds. particles in a eld theory on the d3-branes are represented
by string junctions connecting some of the 7-branes and the probe d3-branes. because the

avor symmetry of the eld theory is also regarded as the gauge symmetry on the 7-branes,
it is very important to study how to construct gauge theories on 7-branes with various gauge

symmetries.

it is already known that we can construct theories with arbitrary simply-laced gauge groups
and analyze their spectra by introducing [p, q] 7-branes[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]. the bps condition

for states in the eld theories is represented with the self-intersection numbers of corresponding
junctions. using this condition, we can determine the spectra of eld theories with ade

avor symmetries even in the strong coupling region. however, the junction description of
four dimensional eld theories with non-simply-laced avor symmetries in the strong coupling

region has not been established. especially, the bps condition has not yet been obtained.

on the other hand, in the weak coupling limit, we can easily construct sp(r) gauge theories
as gauge theories on a stack of parallel r d-branes and an orientifold seven-plane with positive
r-r charge (o+). the purpose of this paper is to study junctions on this background by
means of the heterotic/type iib duality.

one might expect that one can construct so(2r + 1) gauge theory by using an orientifold
seven-plane with negative r-r charge (o), r d7-branes and a fractional d7-brane, which is a
d7-brane identied with its mirror. however, because this set of 7-branes has the non-integral

monodromy

mso(2r+1) =  1 7/2  r

1

! ,

(1)

this conguration is not allowed as a classical solution of supergravity. from the viewpoint of
a eld theory on n probe d3-branes, this fact implies that n = 2 sp(n) gauge theory with
r+1/2 hypermultiplets in the fundamental representation has an anomaly. (classically, we can
consider half-hypermultiplets. they are hypermultiplets whose scalars and fermions belong to
(2, 2n) and (1, 2n) representations of su(2)r  sp(n)gauge respectively.) it is nothing but the
wittens topological anomaly[9]. therefore we will not consider so(2r + 1) gauge theories on
7-branes. furthermore, although 7-brane constructions of other non-simply-laced groups (f2

1

and g2) are also interesting problems, we will not argue them and we will concentrate our
attention to the sp(r) group.

to obtain sp(r) gauge theories on 7-branes, we should lay an o+ and r d7-branes in

parallel. this conguration has the following monodromy.

msp(r) =  1 4  r
1 ! .

(2)

because this monodromy is identical to that of a set of 8 + r d7-branes and an o, one might
expect the bps condition for junctions on these two backgrounds to be identical. however, in
the latter, an open string going around o+ with its both endpoints on one d7-brane cannot
be bps state, and it is undesirable because the string corresponds to the cartan part of the
sp(r) gauge group. this implies that we should modify the bps condition.

in this paper, we analyze the bps condition by means of the hetero/iib duality. in [10],
the correspondence between quantum numbers of heterotic strings on t2 and ones of junctions
on t2/z2 is obtained. because all the orientifold seven planes of the t2/z2 used in [10] are
o, we cannot use the result for our present purpose. in the case in of t2/z2 containing an
o+, the dual is heterotic string theory compactied on t2 with twisted gauge bundle[11]. in
section 2, we review this duality, and we explain how the bps condition for heterotic strings
should be modied in section 3. in section 4, we give the one to one correspondence between

quantum numbers of heterotic strings and ones of junctions and suggest the modied bps
condition for junctions. the last section is devoted to conclusions and discussions.

2 heterotic/type iib duality

in this section we will explain the duality between so(32)1 heterotic string theory compactied
on t2 with non-trivial gauge bundle structure structure and type iib theory on t2/z2 with
three o and one o+ [11]. let us start from the heterotic string theory whose x 7 and x 8
directions are compactied on t2 with radii r7 and r8, respectively. for simplicity, we assume
that the t2 is rectangular and that the ns-ns 2-form eld b78 vanishes. let us consider the
maximal subgroup o(2)  o(16) of so(32). in order to realize the nontrivial structure of the
gauge bundle on the torus, we should introduce wilson lines for both the o(2) and the o(16)
as follows:

x 7 direction : z  exp(2iaa

7ha), x 8 direction : x  exp(2iaa

8ha).

(3)

1precisely, the gauge group is not so(32) but spin(32)/z2. in this paper, we will not care such a point

about the discrete subgroups.

2

the factors z and x are o(2) wilson lines, which are nothing but pauli matrices for 2
representation. these are essential for the non-trivial structure of the gauge bundle. (in what
follows, we represent this torus by t2
, while t2 means a torus with trivial structure of the
bundle.) due to these wilson lines, the gauge group so(32) is broken to o(16). ha and aa

(a = 1, . . . , 8,  = 7, 8) are the cartan generators and wilson lines of this o(16) respectively.

first, we should carry out the s-duality transformation to obtain type i theory on the t2
.
then, we should perform t-duality transformation along the x 7 direction to have type iia
theory. because the x 7 direction is compactied on s1 with radius r7 on the type i side, the

type iia theory is compactied on s1/z2 with length er7 = /r7. the wilson line z  o(2)

along the x 7 direction breaks the gauge group so(32) to its subgroup o(16)  o(16) (here,
we assume aa
 = 0.) and each o(16) factor lives on the eight d8-branes on top of one of two
orientifold eight-planes (o8). the x 8 direction is compactied on s1 with radius r8 as it was
in the type i theory. because of the existence of the non-trivial structure of gauge bundle on
the t2
, the compactication manifold of type iia theory is not just a direct product of the
s1/z2 and the s1. non-commutativity between the wilson lines along the x 7 and the x 8
direction,

xzx = z,

(4)

implies that when we go around the s1 along the x 8 direction, we should swap the two o8.
as a result, we have a mobius strip as a compactication manifold of type iia theory.

in order to perform further t-duality transformation along the x 8 direction to arrive at
the nal type iib conguration, it is convenient to rearrange the mobius strip to a cylinder.

boundary is o8 and another is capped with a cross cap ((b) in fig.1). after this rearrangement,
it becomes clear that the x 8 direction is compactied on s1 with radius 2r8 (not r8). by

namely, as is shown in fig.1, the mobius strip with width er7 and circumference 2r8
((a) in fig.1) is equivalent to a cylinder with length er7/2 and circumference 4r8 whose one
performing t-duality transformation along this s1, we obtain t2/z2 with radii er7/2 and
er8/2 = 1/(2r8). (radii of t2/z2 mean radii of two cycles of the t2.) by this t-duality

transformation, the cross cap is transformed into an o and an o+, and the o8 on the
boundary is transformed into two o. we will refer this compactication manifold by t2/z
2,
while orientifold with four o by t2/z2.

using this series of dualities, we can obtain some properties of o+. for example, let us
consider a type i d-string winding once around the x 7 direction, which is s-dual of a heterotic
string winding around the same direction. by the rst t-duality along the x 7 direction, this
d-string is transformed into a fractional d-particle on o8, whose mirror image is itself, and

figure 1: a mobius strip (a) can be rearranged to a cylinder with one end capped with a cross
cap (b). the thick lines represent orientifold eight-planes.

by the second t-duality along the x 8 direction it is transformed into a type iib d-string
with winding number 1/2. the winding number 1/2 implies that the d-string is stretched
between two orientifold planes along the x 8 direction.
in the cylindrical representation of
the mobius strip ((b) in fig.1), the o8, on which the fractional d-particle exists, is only on
one side. therefore, the type iib d-string is also on the same side of the t2/z
2. this fact
suggests that a d-string cannot be attached to o+. we can obtain the same conclusion by
starting from a type i d-string wrapped around the x 8 direction as follows: because the gauge
group on the d-string is o(1) = z2, the wilson line on it takes two values 1. through the
t-duality along the x 7 direction the d-string is transformed into a d2-brane wrapped over
the mobius strip which inherits the wilson line of the d-string. if we rearrange the mobius
strip to the cylindrical representation, the length of the cycle along the x 8 direction become
twice. as a result, the wilson line is squared and always becomes +1 regardless of the original
value. therefore, the possible x 8 coordinate of the dual type iib d-string is unique. this is
consistent with the fact that a d-string cannot be attached to o+. of cause, although one
d-string cannot be attached to o+, even number of d-strings can be simultaneously attached
because they can be regarded as d-strings going around o+ and turning back. furthermore,
the number of fundamental strings attached to an orientifold plane is, regardless of its charge,
always even integer. as a result, we conclude that both f-string charges and d-string charges
of strings attached to o+ should always be even integers.

in the case of junctions on t2/z2 (with four o), we can always remove strings attached to
one of four o by adding null junctions [10], which can be shrinked to a point by a continuous

4

deformation. however, in that case, we should admit improper junctions, which contain strings

with fractional charge, in order to remove a string with odd integral charge attached on the
o. on the other hand, because the f-string charge and d-string charge of a string attached
on o+ are always even integers as we have explained, for any junction on t2/z
2, we can
remove a strings attached on o+ without introducing such improper junctions. therefore, we
can deform any junction on t2/z
2 into a standard conguration, in which strings starting
from three o planes and eight d-branes on o+ meet together at a point as is expressed in
fig.2. (if it is necessary, we should move the d7-branes.) in this conguration, arbitrary

junctions are specied by f-string charges m1, m2, m3 and d-string charges n1, n2, n3 of
strings going outward from three o and the number of strings qa attached on a-th d7-brane.
by means of the charge conservation, the following relations hold:

m0 + m1 + m2 + m3 = 0, n1 + n2 + n3 = 0,

(5)

where m0 is the sum of q1, . . . , q8. therefore, we have 12 independent charges.

due to the monodromies of 7-branes, we should introduce branch cuts and we cannot dene
the string charges until we x the branch cuts. our convention is as follows: the t2/z
2 is
made of two rectangles, i.e., a rectangle on the front side and that on the back side. we

assume that all the branch cuts run on the back side and that all strings run on the front side.
using this denition, we can dene the string charges up to transformation    + 1.

3 the bps condition

l and eight fermionic elds i as the left movers and 24 bosonic elds x i

on the worldsheet of heterotic strings, in the light cone formalism, there are eight bosonic
elds x i
r as the right
movers. (we assume the left mover is supersymmetric.) among the right movers, 16 bosonic
coordinates are compactied on the self-dual even lattice and are equivalent to 32 fermionic
elds through the fermionization. let us use 1, . . . , 32 to represent these 32 fermions. the
so(32) symmetry among these real fermions gives the spacetime gauge symmetry.

at rst, let us consider the heterotic string theory compactied on t2 (with four o) along
the x 7 and the x 8 directions. for the argument below, it is convenient to combine these real
fermions into complex fermions as follows:

a+ = 2a1 + i2a,

a = 2a1  i2a,

a = 1, . . . , 16.

(6)

the a carry a charge 1 with respect to a-th u(1) factor of cartan subgroup u(1)16 
so(32). let a(16)
 ) ( = 7, 8) denote the wilson lines for the u(1)16. because
the fermions couple to them, the boundary condition of the fermions on a string with winding
number n depends on the wilson line.

q(16)  q(16)  1,

(14)

where fnosc represents the contribution from excitations which do not change the fermion
number q(16). because n should vanish for bps states and fnosc is always non-negative, we
obtain the following bps condition from the level matching condition el0 = l0.

(15)

using integral indices m, n and k(16), we have

2m7n7 + 2m8n8 + k(16)  k(16)  2.

(16)

this is the bps condition for heterotic strings on t2. because these heterotic strings are
related to the junctions on t2/z2, we can interpret the condition (16) as that for junctions.

when we establish the relations between quantum numbers of heterotic strings and invari-
ant charges of the dual type iib junctions, we should carefully take account of the depencende

of the fundamental string winding numbers upon the position of d-branes as is mentioned in
[12] for type i case. if there exists a fundamental string attached on a winding d-string, the
winding number of the fundamental string depends on the position of the d-string. to avoid

this matter, as is done in [10], let us use the at background on which the r-r charge is locally
cancelled. on the background, the fundamental string winding numbers are independent of
the positions of d-strings and the normalized kaluza-klein momenta m
 and winding num-
bers n are identied with the f-string winding numbers f and d-string winding numbers
d in the type iib picture by the following simple relations:

f7 = m

7, f8 = m

8, d7 =

2

, d8 =

n7
2

,

(17)

7



and each component of q(16) is identied with the number of strings attached to each d7-
brane. after obtaining these relations one should deform the background if one want to
shift to the standard conguration. because k(16), m and n are independent of the wilson
lines a(16)
, once we have established the relations on the at background, we can obtain the
relations between quantum numbers in heterotic string theory with vanishing wilson lines and
invariant charges of junctions in standard conguration. the a(16)
dependence (10) of q(16)
corresponds to the hanany-witten eect[13, 12] and the invariant charges for d-branes qa in
the standard conguration is identied with the components of vector k(16). furthermore we
can represent the string charges mi and ni as follows[10].



m0 = k1 +    + k16,

(18)

m1 = 2m8 +2n8 n9 m0, m2 = 2m8 +2m9 n8 n9 +m0, m3 = 2m9 n8 +2n9 m0,
(19)

n1 = n9, n2 = n8  n9, n3 = n8.

(20)

by using these relations, we can show that (16) is equivalent with the bps condition for

junctions given in [7, 8].

next, let us discuss the compactication of heterotic string theory on t2

 and observe how
the condition (16) is modied. as we have explained in section 2, the nontrivial structure of

the gauge bundle is realized by the wilson line (3). however, for our purpose, it is convenient
to use another subgroup sp(1)  sp(8) and the following wilson lines:

x 7 direction : iz  exp(2iaa

7ha), x 8 direction : ix  exp(2iaa

8ha),

(21)

in this formulation, the gauge symmetry sp(8) appears when a(8)

where iz and ix are elements of the sp(1) and ha (a = 1, . . . , 8) are the cartan generators
in
of the sp(8).
order to obtain the modied bps condition, we have to quantize the worldsheet fermions
taking account of the wilson lines (21). when both the winding numbers n8 and n9 are
even, the boundary condition of fermions is same as that of strings on t2 with wilson line
a(16)
 are wilson lines of the sp(8) subgroup appearing in (21) and
we can use the result for strings on t2. the eight components of a(8)
 represent the positions
of eight d7-branes on t2/z
2, and the invariant charges representing the numbers of strings
attached to these d7-branes are charges coupling to the a(8)
 . the charge vector and normal
ordered one are given by

 ) where a(8)

 = (a(8)

 , a(8)

 = 0.

q(8) = q(1) + q(2), k(8) = k(1) + k(2),

(22)

8

where q(i) and k(i) are former and latter half of the charge vectors dened by (9).

q(16) = (q(1), q(2)), k(16) = (k(1), k(2)).

(23)

because k(16) is on the self-dual even lattice, k(8) takes values on the sp(8) root lattice gener-
ated by

 2e1,

e1  e2,

e2  e3,

. . .

,

e7  e8.

(24)

a state of a string on the torus t2
 is specied by giving winding numbers n, kaluza-klein
indices m and u(1) charges q(8). in the case of t2 compactication, kaluza-klein indices m
are integral numbers. however, now, we should take account of the eect of sp(1) wilson lines
iz and ix. because the eigen values for these operators on gso even states are 1, their
eect is expressed by allowing m to be half integers. let us dene integral labels m = 2m.
2 is half of the t2/z2[11], in order to normalize the coordinate
because the size of the t2/z
on the t2/z
 . from
(10), the following relation between q(8) and k(8) is obtained.

2 in the same way as the t2/z2, we introduce the vector a(8)

 = 2a(8)

q(8) = q(1) + q(2) = k(1) + k(2)  2a(8)

 n = k(8)  a(8)

 n.

using these variables, the quantization of kaluza-klein momenta (13) is rewritten as

m

 =

1

2(cid:18)m + k(8)  a(8)

 

1
2

a(8)

  a(8)

 n(cid:19) ,

(25)

(26)

where the inner products are dened with the metric 18. by substituting these equation into
(15), we obtain the bps condition for heterotic strings on the t2

 as

2m7n7 + 2m8n8 + k(8)  k(8) + (k(1)  k(2))2  4.

let us dene a function f (k(8)) as follows.

f (k(8)) = min
k(8)xed

(4  (k(1)  k(2))2).

(27)

(28)

because the vector k(16) = (k(1), k(2)) is on the self-dual even lattice, we can represent f (k(8))
in the following way.

f (k(8)) = |4  #(odd components of k(8))|.

(29)

because the sum of all the components of k(8) is even, f (k(8)) is always 0, 2 or 4. using this
function, (27) is rewritten as

2m7n7 + 2m8n8 + k(8)  k(8)  f (k(8)).

(30)

9

this is the modied bps condition for heterotic strings on t2
. until now, in the deduction of
(30), we have supposed n  2z. however, we can show that the same inequality is obtained
for any winding number as follows: in the sector with (n7, n8) = (1, 0) mod 2, the boundary
condition of worldsheet fermions is identical to that for heterotic strings on t2 with wilson
lines a(16)
8  s(8)/2) with s(8) a eight-dimensional vector with all the
components 1/2. because the bps condition is independent of the wilson lines, we have
the same result for this sector. furthermore, because other two sectors (n8, n9) = (0, 1) and
(1, 1) mod 2 can be obtained from the (1, 0) sector by the modular transformation of the torus,
the condition for these sectors should also be the same.

8 + s(8)/2, a(8)

8 = (a(8)

for heterotic strings on t2, if a set of the quantum numbers {m, n, k(16)} is specied,
there exists at least one state having the given quantum numbers, and if the set of quantum
numbers satises the bps condition, at least one bps state exists. however, for heterotic
strings on t2
, it is not the case. for example, let us consider states with n7 = n8 = 0
and k(8)  k(8) = 4. for these states to be bps states, all the components of k(8) should
be even or odd, and k(8) should have one nonzero component 2. there are 16 such states
a
1/2a+8
1/2 |0i. these are what become massless when sp(8) gauge group is enhanced on the
o+ and correspond to the long roots of sp(8) lie algebra. (generally, sp(k) has 2k long
roots with norm 4.) because the eigenvalues of ix, iz  sp(1) for these states are +1, the
quantum numbers m should be even integers. in other words, although the set of quantum
numbers {m, n, k(8)} with n = 0, k(8)  k(8) = 4 and m8m9 / 4z satises the bps condition
(30), there are no bps states with the quantum numbers. (as a result, we have sp(8) gauge
group only on one orientifold plane.)

4 relation between quantum numbers

in this section, we will explain how we can obtain the one to one correspondence between
quantum numbers of heterotic strings on t2
2. it
is an variation of the relation between het/t2 and iib/(t2/z2) given in [10].

 and invariant charges of junctions on t2/z

via the duality explained in section 2, the d-string winding numbers d and the f-string
2 is related to the quantum numbers of heterotic strings

winding numbers f on the at t2/z
on t2

 as follows:

f7 = 2m

7, f8 = 2m

8, d7 = 

1
2

n8, d8 =

1
2

n7.

(31)

comparing to (17),the reason for the existence of extra 2 factors for f is that, because the size
of the t2/z
2 is half of that of t2/z2, in order to give the same energy the winding numbers

10

should be twice as (17). these extra 2 factors are compensated by the extra 1/2 factor in
(26). therefore, it is expected that we obtain the exactly same relations between {m, n, k(8)}
and {d, f} as that for the het/t2 - iib/(t2/z2) duality given in [10]. however, there is
one problem. to use the relation (31), we should use the at background. because, unlike
the orientifold with four o, the positive r-r charge of the o+ cannot be canceled by the
d7-brane charge, there is no bps at background.

this obstruction can be overcome by using a non-bps at background as follows: if we
allow non-bps congurations, we can make a at background by setting four anti-d7-branes
on top of the o+. this brane conguration gives the gauge group so(8)4 with rank 16. this

(8)
implies that vectors k(8), q(8) and a
should be extended to 16-dimensional vectors. this

can be done in the following way. let us consider the situation in which d d7-branes and
d anti-d7-branes are created at a certain point on the t2/z
2. then 8 dimensional vectors
should be extended to 8+2d dimensional vectors. let us dene a(8+d,d)
as vectors representing
the positions of branes and anti-branes. we assume the former 8 + d components of a(8+d,d)
represent the positions of 8 + d d-branes and latter d components represent the positions of
the d anti-d-branes. if the d d-branes and the d anti-d-branes are stacked at a point, and



junction does not attached on them, the quantization (26) should not change. this is achieved
by introducing the metric gab = diag(18+d, 1d). furthermore, if we demand that when a d-
brane and an anti-d-brane are on top of each other, an open string connecting them should
not contribute to the string winding number obtained by (26), we should dene q(8+d,d) as a

11

vector whose former 8 + d components represent the number of strings going out from each

d-brane while latter d components represents the number of strings going into each anti-d7-
(8+d,d)
dependence of q(8+d,d) representing the hanany-witten
brane. under this denition, a


eect can be given in the same equation as (25):

(8+d,d)
q(8+d,d) = k(8+d,d)  a


n.

(32)

in this way, we can extend the vectors to 16-dimensional vectors (d = 4) and we can

realize the at background, on which the relations (31) are available. once we have obtained
the relations (31), in the same way as we explained in section 3 in the case of het/t2 and
iib/(t2/z2), we can obtain the following relation for the string charges of junctions on the
background with 12 d7-branes and 4 anti-d7-branes near the o+.

m0 =

ka 

12xa=1

ka.

16xa=13

(33)

m1 = 2m8 +2n8 n9 m0, m2 = 2m8 +2m9 n8 n9 +m0, m3 = 2m9 n8 +2n9 m0,
(34)

n1 = n9, n2 = n8  n9, n3 = n8.

(35)

(we use ka to represent the components of the k(8+d,d), while the components of k(8) are ka.)

to obtain the standard conguration with eight d7-branes, four pairs of d7-branes and
anti-d7-branes should be annihilated. in this process, the gauge group u(12)  u(4) is broken
to u(8) by means of the tachyon condensation[14]. after the condensation, we have eight
charges ka instead of ka. unless we specify the pattern of the tachyon condensation, we cannot
represent ka by ka. however, because the u(1) is not broken by the tachyon condensation, the
total charge coupled with the diagonal u(1) is unchanged and the equation (33) is replaced
by

m0 =

ka.

(36)

8xa=1

because the relations (36), (34) and (35) are identical to the relation appearing in het/t2-
iib/(t2/z2) duality, the left hand side of (30) must be rewritten to the identical expression
to what is given in [10]. as a result, we obtain the following bps condition for junctions:

(j, j)  f (k(8)),

(37)

where the left hand side is the self intersection number of junction j obtained by means of
the formula given in [2] and f (k(8)) is the function dened by (29). however, as we mentioned

12

above, we should note that even this equation hold, the existence of the corresponding bps

junction is not guaranteed.

let us consider the decompactication limit in the type iib theory and look at the vicinity
of o+. we suppose r of eight d7-branes are left near the o+ and other 8  r d7-branes are
decoupled. in this limit, only the states with m = n = kr+1 = kr+2 =    = k8 = 0 are left.
the bps condition is given by

(j, j) = k  k  f (k),

(38)

where k is r-dimensional charge vector on the sp(r) root lattice representing the numbers of

the strings attached to the r d7-branes. although the function f (k) was originally dened for
the eight dimensional vector, we can use the same denition for the vector of dimension r < 8
because the denition (29) is unaected by extra zero components. although we cannot use

the heterotic / type iib duality for r > 8, let us assume the same bps condition holds. then
we nd that the adjoint representation of sp(r) gauge group are reproduced as follows: let
nodd denote the number of odd components of a vector k. the norm k  k is always equal with
or lager than nodd and the following inequality should hold for bps states.

nodd  k  k  |4  nodd|.

(39)

due to this equation, only two values 0 and 2 is allowed for nodd. when nodd = 0, the vector
k should satisfy k  k  4. therefore, all the components are zero or only one component is
2 and others are zero. they give the cartan generators and the long roots of sp(r) gauge
group. when nodd = 2, two components of k are 1 and they correspond to the short roots of
sp(r). collecting these states altogether, we obtain the adjoint representation of the sp(r).

5 conclusions and discussions

we investigated the duality between heterotic strings on torus with nontrivial gauge bundle
 and junctions on background containing an o+. first, we gave the bps condition
structure t2
for heterotic strings on t2
, using the correspondence between quantum numbers of heterotic
strings and junctions established on a non-bps at background, we obtained the modied
bps conditions for junctions on t2/z
2. by means of this condition, we could reproduce the
adjoint representation of sp(r) gauge group on the o+.

as we mentioned in introduction, string junctions are very useful tools for analyzing non-
perturbative spectra of supersymmetric yang-mills theories on the probe d3-branes. the

13

gauge theory on n d3-branes on a background with an o+ and k d7-branes is n = 2 super-
symmetric so(2n) gauge theory with k hypermultiplets. for complete analysis of this theory,
we need the bps conditions for junctions attached on the probe d3-branes on a background
with an o+. if we had obtained it, we would be able to know the complete spectrum of bps
particles of the theory. however, unfortunately, our argument with the perturbative heterotic
strings is not sucient for the purpose because dual of d3-branes are solitonic ve-branes and
our argument here did not contain them.
