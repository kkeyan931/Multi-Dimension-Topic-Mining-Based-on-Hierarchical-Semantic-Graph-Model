abstract: we study the asymptotic limits of the heterotic string theories compactied
on tori. we nd a bilinear form uniquely determined by dualities which becomes
lorentzian in the case of one spacetime dimension. for the case of the so(32) theory,
the limiting descriptions include so(32) heterotic strings, type i, type ia and other
t-duals, m-theory on k3, type iia theory on k3 and type iib theory on k3 and
possibly new limits not understood yet.

1. introduction

in a recent collaboration with w. fischler [1], we showed that the space of asymptotic
directions in the moduli space of toroidally compactied m-theory had a hyperbolic
metric, related to the hyperbolic structure of the e10 duality group. we pointed out
that this could have been anticipated from the hyperbolic nature of metric on moduli
space in low energy sugra, which ultimately derives from the negative kinetic term
for the conformal factor.

an important consequence of this claim is that there are asymptotic regions of the
moduli space which cannot be mapped onto either 11d sugra (on a large smooth
manifold) or weakly coupled type ii string theory. these regions represent true sin-
gularities of m-theory at which no known description of the theory is applicable. in-
terestingly, the classical solutions of the theory all follow trajectories which interpolate
between the mysterious singular region and the regions which are amenable to a semi-
classical description. this introduces a natural arrow of time into the theory. we

1

suggested that moduli were the natural semiclassical variables that dene cosmological
time in m-theory and that the universe began in the mysterious singular region.

we note that many of the singularities of the classical solutions can be removed by
duality transformations. this makes the special nature of the singular region all the
more striking1.

in view of the connection to the properties of the low energy sugra lagrangian,
we conjectured in [1] that the same sort of hyperbolic structure would characterize
moduli spaces of m-theory with less susy than the toroidal background.
in this
paper, we verify this conjecture for 11d sugra backgrounds of the form k3  t 6,
which is the same as the moduli space of heterotic strings compactied on t 9. a notable
dierence is the absence of a completely satisfactory description of the safe domains
of asymptotic moduli space. this is not surprising. the moduli space is known to
have an f-theory limit in which there is no complete semiclassical description of the
physics. rather, there are dierent semiclassical limits valid in dierent regions of a
large spacetime.

another dierence is the appearance of asymptotic domains with dierent internal
symmetry groups. 11d sugra on k3  t 3 exhibits a u(1)28 gauge group in four
noncompact dimensions. at certain singularities, this is enhanced to a nonabelian
group, but these singularities have nite codimension in the moduli space. nonetheless,
there are asymptotic limits in the full moduli space (i.e. generic asymptotic directions)
in which the full heterotic symmetry group is restored. from the heterotic point of
view, the singularity removing, symmetry breaking, parameters are wilson lines on t 9.
in the innite (heterotic torus) volume limit, these become irrelevant. in this paper we
will only describe the subspace of asymptotic moduli space with full so(32) symmetry.
we will call this the ho moduli space from now on. the points of the moduli space will
be parametrized by the dimensionless heterotic string coupling constant ghet = exp p0
and the radii ri = lhet exp pi where i = 1, . . . 10  d with d being the number of large
spacetime dimensions and lhet denoting the heterotic string length. throughout the
paper we will neglect factors of order one.

apart from these, more or less expected, dierences, our results are quite similar
to those of [1]. the modular group of the completely compactied theory preserves a
lorentzian bilinear form with one timelike direction. the (more or less) well understood
regimes correspond to the future light cone of this bilinear form, while all classical solu-

1for reference, we note that there are actually two dierent types of singular region: neither the
exterior of the light cone in the space of asymptotic directions, nor the past light cone, can be mapped
into the safe domain. classical solutions do not visit the exterior of the light cone.

tions interpolate between the past and future light cones. we interpret this as evidence
for a new hyperbolic algebra o, whose innite momentum frame galilean subalgebra
is precisely the ane algebra o(8, 24) of [3]-[4]. this would precisely mirror the relation
between e10 and e9. recently, ganor [5] has suggested the de18 dynkin diagram as
the denition of the basic algebra of toroidally compactied heterotic strings. this is
indeed a hyperbolic algebra in the sense that it preserves a nondegenerate bilinear form
with precisely one negative eigenvalue2.

1.1 the bilinear form
we adopt the result of [1] with a few changes in notation. first we will use d = 11  k
instead of k because now we start in ten dimensions instead of eleven. the parameter
that makes the parallel between toroidal m-theory and heterotic compactications most
obvious is the number of large spacetime dimensions d. in [1], the bilinear form was

k

i = (

xi=1

pi)2 + (d  2)

(p 2

i ).

k

xi=1

(1.1)

where pi (denoted pi in [1]) are the logarithms of the radii in 11-dimensional planck
units.

now let us employ the last logarithm pk as the m-theoretical circle of a type
iia description. for the he theory, which can be understood as m-theory on a line
interval, we expect the same bilinear form where pk is the logarithm of the length of
the horava-witten line interval. now we convert (1.1) to the heterotic units according
to the formulae (k  1 = 10  d)

pk =

p0,

pi = pi 

1
3

p0,

i = 1, . . . 10  d

(1.2)

where p0 = ln ghet and pi = ln(ri/lhet) for i = 1, . . . 10  d. to simplify things, we
use natural logarithms instead of the logarithms with a large base t like in [1]. this
corresponds to a simple rescaling of ps but the directions are nally the only thing that
planckg2/3
we study. in obtaining (1.2) we have used the well-known formulae r11 = leleven
and leleven

het lhet. substituing (1.2) into (1.1) we obtain

planck = g1/3

xi=1

pi)2 + (d  2)

10d

(p2

i ).

xi=1

(1.3)

2kac denition of a hyperbolic algebra requires it to turn into an ane or nite dimensional
algebra when one root of the dynkin diagram is cut. we believe that this is too restrictive and that
the name hyperbolic should be based solely on the signature of the cartan metric. we thank o. ganor
for discussions of this point.

this bilinear form encodes the kinetic terms for the moduli in the e8  e8 heterotic
theory (he) in the einstein frame for the large coordinates.

we can see very easily that (1.3) is conserved by t-dualities. a simple t-duality
(without wilson lines) takes he theory to he theory with r1 inverted and acts on the
parameters like

(p0, p1, p2, . . .)  (p0  p1,p1, p2, . . .).

(1.4)

the change of the coupling constant keeps the eective 9-dimensional gravitational
constant g2
het/r1 = g 2
1 (in units of lhet) xed. in any number of dimensions (1.4)
conserves the quantity

het/r

10d

p10 = 2p0 +

xi=1

pi

(1.5)

and therefore also the rst term in (1.3). the second term in (1.3) is xed trivially
since only the sign of p1 was changed. sometimes we will use p10 instead of p0 as the
extra parameter apart from p1, . . . p10d.

in fact those two terms in (1.3) are the only terms conserved by t-dualities and
only the relative ratio between them is undetermined. however it is determined by
s-dualities, which exist for d  4. for the moment, we ask the reader to take this
claim on faith. since the he and ho moduli spaces are the same on a torus, the same
bilinear form can be viewed in the so(32) language. it takes the form (1.3) in so(32)
variables as well.

let us note also another interesting invariance of (1.3), which is useful for the
so(32) case. let us express the parameters in the terms of the natural parameters of
the s-dual type i theory

p0 = q0 =  ln(gtype i),

pi = qi 

1
2

q0,

i = 1, . . . 10  d

(1.6)

where qi = ln(ri/ltype i). we used gtype i = 1/ghet and lhet = g1/2
type iltype i, the latter ex-
presses that the tension of the d1-brane and the heterotic strings are equal. substituing
this into (1.3) we get the same formula with qs.

i = (2q0 +

10d

xi=1

qi)2 + (d  2)

10d

(q2
i )

xi=1

(1.7)

1.2 moduli spaces and heterotic s-duality

let us recall a few well-known facts about the moduli space of heterotic strings toroidally
compactied to d dimensions. for d > 4 the moduli space is

md = r+  (so(26d, 10d, z)\so(26d, 10d, r)/so(26d, r)so(10d, r)).
(1.8)

4

the factor r+ determines the coupling constant lhet. for d = 8 the second factor can
be understood as the moduli space of elliptically bered k3s (with unit ber volume),
giving the duality with the f-theory. for d = 7 the second factor also corresponds to
the einstein metrics on a k3 manifold with unit volume which expresses the duality
with m-theory on k3. in this context, the factor r+ can be understood as the volume
of the k3. similarly for d = 5, 6, 7 the second factor describes conformal eld theory of
type ii string theories on k3, the factor r+ is related to the type iia coupling constant.
for d = 4, i.e. compactication on t 6, there is a new surprise. the eld strength
h of the b-eld can be hodge-dualized to a 1-form which is the exterior derivative
of a dual 0-form potential, the axion eld. the dilaton and axion are combined in
the s-eld which means that in four noncompact dimensions, toroidally compactied
heterotic strings exhibit the sl(2, z) s-duality.

m4 = sl(2, z)\sl(2, r)/so(2, r)  (so(22, 6, z)\so(22, 6, r)/so(22)  so(6)).
(1.9)
let us nd how our parameters pi transform under s-duality. the s-duality is a
kind of electromagnetic duality. therefore an electrically charged state must be mapped
to a magnetically charged state. the u(1) symmetry expressing rotations of one of the
six toroidal coordinate is just one of the 22 u(1)s in the cartan subalgebra of the
full gauge group. it means that the electrically charged states, the momentum modes
in the given direction of the six torus, must be mapped to the magnetically charged
objects which are the kk-monopoles.

the strings wrapped on the t 6 must be therefore mapped to the only remaining
point-like3 bps objects available, i.e. to wrapped ns5-branes. we know that ns5-
branes are magnetically charged with respect to the b-eld so this action of the elec-
tromagnetic duality should not surprise us. we nd it convenient to combine this
s-duality with t-dualities on all six coordinates of the torus. the combined symmetry
st 6 exchanges the point-like bps objects in the following way:

momentum modes  wrapped ns5-branes

wrapped strings  kk-monopoles

(1.10)

of course, the distinguished direction inside the t 6 on both sides is the same. the
tension of the ns5-brane is equal to 1/(g2
het). now consider the tension of the kk-
monopole. in 11 dimensions, a kk-monopole is reinterpreted as the d6-brane so its

hetl6

3macroscopic strings (and higher-dimensional objects) in d = 4 have at least logarithmic ir diver-

gence of the dilaton and other elds and therefore their tension becomes innite.

the kk-monopole must always be a (d  5)-brane where d is the dimension of the
spacetime. since it is a gravitational object and the dimensions along its worldvolume
play no role, the tension must be always of order (r1)2 in appropriate planck units
where r1 is the radius of the circle under whose u(1) the monopole is magnetically
charged. namely in the case of the heterotic string in d = 4, the kk-monopole must
be another vebrane whose tension is equal to

knowing this, we can nd the transformation laws for ps with respect to the st 6

the tensions in (1.10) we get

(1.13)

(1.14)

it means that the radii of the six-torus are xed in string units i.e. p1, . . . , p6 are
xed. now it is straightforward to see that the eective four-dimensional so(32)
coupling constant g2
het/v6 is inverted and the four-dimensional newtons constant
must remain unchanged. the induced transformation on the ps is

hetl6

(p0, p1, . . . p6, p7, p8 . . .)  (p0 + m, p1, . . . p6, p7 + m, p8 + m . . .)

(1.15)

where m = (p1 + p2 + p3 + p4 + p5 + p6  2p0) and the form (1.3) can be checked to be
constant. it is also easy to see that such an invariance uniquely determines the form
up to an overall normalization i.e. it determines the relative magnitude of two terms in
(1.3).

for d = 4 this st 6 symmetry can be expressed as p10  p10 with p1, . . . p6 xed
which gives the z2 subgroup of the sl(2, z). for d = 3 the transformation (1.15) acts

6

as p7  p10 so p10 becomes one of eight parameters that can be permuted with each
other. it is a trivial consequence of the more general fact that in three dimensions, the
dilaton-axion eld unies with the other moduli and the total space becomes [2]

m3 = sl(24, 8, z) \ sl(24, 8, r) / so(24, r)  so(8, r).

(1.16)

we have thus repaid our debt to the indulgent reader, and veried that the bilinear
form (1.3) is indeed invariant under the dualities of the heterotic moduli space for d  3.
for d = 2 the bilinear form is degenerate and is the cartan form of the ane algebra
o(8, 24) studied by [3]. for d = 1 it is the cartan form of de18 [5]. the consequences
of this for the structure of the extremes of moduli space are nearly identical to those
of [1]. the major dierence is our relative lack of understanding of the safe domain.
we believe that this is a consequence of the existence of regimes like f-theory or 11d
sugra on a large smooth k3 with isolated singularities, where much of the physics
is accessible but there is no systematic expansion of all scattering amplitudes. in the
next section we make some remarks about dierent extreme regions of the restricted
moduli space that preserves the full so(32) symmetry.

2. covering the so(32) moduli space

2.1 heterotic strings, type i, type ia and d  9
one new feature of heterotic moduli spaces is the apparent possibility of having asymp-
totic domains with enhanced gauge symmetry. for example, if we consider the descrip-
tion of heterotic string theory on a torus from the usual weak coupling point of view,
there are domains with asymptotically large heterotic radii and weak coupling, where
the the full nonabelian rank 16 lie groups are restored. all other parameters are held
xed at what appears from the weak coupling point of view to be genericvalues. this
includes wilson lines. in the large volume limit, local physics is not sensitive to the
wilson line symmetry breaking.

now, consider the limit described by weakly coupled type ia string theory on a
large orbifold. in this limit, the theory consists of d-branes and orientifolds, placed
along a line interval. there is no way to restore the e8  e8 symmetry in this regime.
thus, even the safe domain of asymptotic moduli space appears to be divided into
regimes in which dierent nonabelian symmetries are restored. apart from sets of
measure zero (e.g. partial decompactications) we either have one of the full rank 16
nonabelian groups, or no nonabelian symmetry at all. the example of f-theory tells us
that the abelian portion of asymptotic moduli space has regions without a systematic
semiclassical expansion.

7

in a similar manner, consider the moduli space of the e8  e8 heterotic strings
on rectilinear tori. we have only two semiclassical descriptions with manifest e8  e8
symmetry, namely he strings and the horava-witten (hw) domain walls. already
for d = 9 (and any d < 9) we would nd limits that are described neither by he nor
by hw. for example, consider a limit of m-theory on a cylinder with very large ghet
but the radius of the circle, r, in the domain lp  r  l2
planck, and unbroken
e8  e8. we do not know how to describe this limit with any known semiclassical
expansion. we will nd that we can get a more systematic description of asymptotic
domains in the ho case, and will restrict attention to that regime for the rest of this
paper.

for d = 10 there are only two lim-
its. p0 < 0 gives the heterotic strings
and p0 > 0 is the type i theory. however
already for d = 9 we have a more inter-
esting picture analogous to the gure 1
in [1]. let us make a counterclockwise
trip around the gure. we start at a ho
point with p1 = 0 which is a weakly cou-
pled heterotic string theory with radii of
order lhet (therefore it is adjacent to its
t-dual region). when we go around the circle, the radius and also the coupling in-
creases and we reach the line p0  (p1  p10)/2 = 0 where we must switch to the type i
description. then the radius decreases again so that we must perform a t-duality and
switch to the type ia description. this happens for p1  (p0/2) = (3p1 + p10)/4 = 0; we
had to convert r1 to the units of ltype i = g1/2
het lhet. then we go on and the coupling
gia and/or the size of the line interval increases. the most interesting is the nal
boundary given by p1 = 0 which guarantees that each of the point of the p-space is
covered precisely by one limit.

figure 1: the limits in d = 9.

we can show that p1 > 0 is precisely the condition that the dilaton in the type ia
theory is not divergent. roughly speaking, in units of ltype i = lia the gravitational
potential is linear in x1 and proportional to g2
ia comes from the grav-
itational constant and 1/gia comes from the tension of the d8-branes. therefore we
require not only gia < 1 but also gia < ltype i/rline interval. performing the t-duality
ltype i/rline interval = rcircle/ltype i and converting to lhet the condition becomes pre-
cisely rcircle > lhet.

ia/gia. here g2

in all the text we adopt (and slightly modify) the standard denition [1] for an
asymptotic description to be viable: dimensionless coupling constants should be smaller

8

than one, but in cases without translational invariance, the dilaton should not diverge
anywhere, and the sizes of the eective geometry should be greater than the appropriate
typical scale (the string length for string theories or the planck length for m-theory).
it is important to realize that in the asymptotic regions we can distinguish between e.g.
type i and type ia because their physics is dierent. we cannot distinguish between
them in case the t-dualized circle is of order ltype i but such vacua are of measure zero
in our investigation and form various boundaries in the parameter space. this is the
analog of the distinction we made between the iia and iib asymptotic toroidal moduli
spaces in [1]

2.2 type ia2 and d = 8

in d = 8 we will have to use a new desciption to cover the parameter space, namely
the double t-dual of type i which we call type ia2. generally, type iak contains 16
d-(9  k)-branes, their images and 2k orientifold (9  k)-planes. we nd it also useful
to perform heterotic t-dualities to make pi positive for i = 1, . . . , 10  d and sort ps
so that our interest is (without a loss of generality) only in congurations with

0  p1  p2  . . .  p10d

(2.1)

we need positive ps for the heterotic description to be valid but such a transformation
can only improve the situation also for type i and its t-dual descriptions since when we
turn ps from negative to positive values, ghet increases and therefore gtype i decreases.
for type i we also need large radii. for its t-duals we need a very small string coupling
and if we make a t-duality to convert r > ltype i into r < ltype i, the coupling gia
still decreases; therefore it is good to have as large radii in the type i limit as possible.

in d = 8 our parameters are p0, p1, p2 or p10, p1, p2 where p10 = 2p0 + p1 + p2
and we will assume 0 < p1 < p2 as we have explained (sets of measure zero such as
the boundaries between regions will be neglected). if p0 < 0, the ho description is
good. otherwise p0 > 0. if furthermore 2p1  p0 > 0 (and therefore also 2p2  p0 > 0),
the radii are large in the type i units and we can use the (weakly coupled) type i
description. otherwise 2p1  p0 < 0. if furthermore 2p2  p0 > 0, we can use type ia
strings. otherwise 2p2  p0 < 0 and the type ia2 description is valid. therefore we
cover all the parameter space. note that the f-theory on k3 did not appear here. in
asymptotic moduli space, the f-theory regime generically has no enhanced nonabelian
symmetries.

in describing the boundaries of the moduli space, we used the relations lhet =
g1/2
type iltype i, ghet = 1/gtype i. the condition for the dilaton not to diverge is still p1 > 0

9

for any type iak description. the longest direction of the t k/z2 of this theory is still
the most dangerous for the dilaton divergence and is not aected by the t-dualities
on the shorter directions of the t k/z2 orientifold. for d = 9 (and fortunately also for
d = 8) the niteness of the dilaton eld automatically implied that giak < 1. however
this is not true for general d. after a short chase through a sequence of s and t-dualities
we nd that the condition giak < 1 can be written as

(k  2)p0  2

pi < 0.

k

xi=1

(2.2)

we used the trivial requirement that the t-dualities must be performed on the shortest
radii (if rj < ltype i, also rj1 < ltype i and therefore it must be also t-dualized). note
that for k = 1 the relation is p0 2p1 < 0 which is a trivial consequence of p1 > 0 and
p0 > 0. also for k = 2 we get a trivial condition 2(p1 + p2) < 0. however for k > 2
this condition starts to be nontrivial. this is neccessary for consistency: otherwise iak
theories would be sucient to cover the whole asymptotic moduli space, and because
of s-dualities we would cover the space several times. it would be also surprising not
to encounter regimes described by large k3 geometries.

2.3 type ia3, m-theory on k3 and d = 7

this happens already for d = 7 where the type ia3 description must be added. the
reasoning starts in the same way: for p0 < 0 ho, for 2p1p0 > 0 type i, for 2p2p0 > 0
type ia, for 2p3  p0 > 0 type ia2.

however, when we have 2p3  p0 < 0 we cannot deduce that the conditions for

type ia3 are obeyed because also (2.2) must be imposed:

p0  2(p1 + p2 + p3) < 0

(2.3)

it is easy to see that this condition is the weakest one i.e. that it is implied by any of
the conditions p0 < 0, 2p1  p0 > 0, 2p2  p0 > 0 or 2p3  p0 > 0. therefore the region
that we have not covered yet is given by the opposite equation

2p0  4(p1 + p2 + p3) = p10  3(p1 + p2 + p3) > 0

(2.4)

the natural hypothesis is that this part of the asymptotic parameter space is the limit
where we can use the description of m-theory on a k3 manifold. however things are
not so easy: the condition that vk 3 > (leleven
planck)4 gives just p10 < 0 which is a weaker
requirement than (2.4).

the k3 manifold has a d16 singularity but this is not the real source of the troubles.
a more serious issue is that the various typical sizes of such a k3 are very dierent

10

and we should require that each of them is greater than leleven
planck (which means that
the shortest one is). in an analogous situation with t 4 instead of k3 the condition
vt 4 > leleven
would be also insucient: all the radii of the four-torus must be greater
planck
than leleven
planck.

4

now we would like to argue that the region dened by (2.4) with our gauge 0 <
p1 < p2 < p3 can indeed be described by the 11d sugra on k3, except near the d16
singularity. therefore, all of the asymptotic moduli space is covered by regions which
have a reasonable semiclassical description.

while the fourth root of the volume of k3 equals

= exp (p0/3  (p1 + p2 + p3)/6) = exp(p10/6),

(2.5)

the minimal typical distance in k3 must be corrected to agree with (2.4). we must
correct it only by a factor depending on the three radii in heterotic units (because only
those are the parameters in the moduli space of metric on the k3) so the distance
equals (conrming (2.4))

lmin.k 3
leleven
planck

= exp (p10/6  (p1 + p2 + p3)/2) .

(2.6)

evidence that (2.6) is really correct and thus that we understand the limits for d = 7
is the following. we must rst realize that 16 independent two-cycles are shrunk to
zero size because of the d16 singularity present in the k3 manifold. this singularity
implies a lack of understanding of the physics in a vicinity of this point but it does
not prevent us from describing the physics in the rest of k3 by 11d sugra. so we
allow the 16 two-cycles to shrink. the remaining 6 two-cycles generate a space of
signature 3+3 in the cohomology lattice: the intersection numbers are identical to the
second cohomology of t 4. we can compute the areas of those 6 two-cycles because the
m2-brane wrapped on the 6-cycles are dual to the wrapped heterotic strings and their
momentum modes. now let us imagine that the geometry of the two-cycles of k3 can
be replaced by the 6 two-cycles of a t 4 which have the same intersection number.

it means that the areas can be written as a1a2, a1a3, a1a4, a2a3, a2a4, a3a4 where
a1, a2, a3, a4 are the radii of the four-torus and correspond to some typical distances of
the k3. if we order the as so that a1 < a2 < a3 < a4, we see that the smallest of the six
areas is a1a2 (the largest two-cycle is the dual a3a4) and similarly the second smallest
area is a1a3 (the second largest two-cycle is the dual a2a4). on the heterotic side we
have radii lhet < r1 < r2 < r3 (thus also l2
het/r1 < lhet) and
therefore the correspondence between the membranes and the wrapping and momentum

het/r3 < l2

het/r2 < l2

(2.9)

which can be seen to coincide with (2.6). there is a subtlety that we should mention.
it is not completely clear whether a1a4 < a2a3 as we assumed in (2.8). the opposite
possibility is obtained by exchanging a1a4 and a2a3 in (2.8) and leads to a1 greater than
(2.9) which would imply an overlap with the other regions. therefore we believe that
the calculation in (2.8) and (2.9) is the correct way to nd the condition for the k3
manifold to be large enough for the 11-dimensional supergravity (as a limit of m-theory)
to be a good description.

2.4 type ia4,5, type iia/b on k3 and d = 6, 5

before we will study new phenomena in lower dimensions, it is useful to note that in
any dimension we add new descriptions of the physics. the last added limit always
corresponds to the true s-dual of the original heterotic string theory  dened by
keeping the radii xed in the heterotic string units (i.e. also keeping the shape of the k3
geometry) and sending the coupling to innity  because this last limit always contains
the direction with p0 large and positive (or p10 large and negative) and other pis much
smaller.

 in 10 dimensions, the true s-dual of heterotic strings is the type i theory.
 in 9 dimensions it is type ia.
 in 8 dimensions type ia2.
 in 7 dimensions we get m-theory on k3.
 in 6 dimensions type iia strings on k3.

12

 in 5 dimensions type iib strings on k3s 1 where the circle decompacties as the

coupling goes to innity. the limit is therefore a six-dimensional theory.

 in 4 dimensions we observe a mirror copy of the region p10 < 0 to arise for p10 > 0.

the strong coupling limit is the heterotic string itself.

 in 3 dimensions the dilaton-axion is already unied with the other moduli so it
becomes clear that we studied an overly specialized direction in the examples
above. nevertheless the same claim as in d = 4 can be made.

 in 2 dimensions only positive values of p10 are possible therefore the strong cou-

pling limit does not exist in the safe domain of moduli space.

 in 1 dimension the lorentzian structure of the parameter space emerges. only
the future light cone corresponds to semiclassical physics which is reasonably
well understood. the strong coupling limit dened above would lie inside the
unphysical past light cone.

now let us return to the discussion of how to separate the parameter space into
regions where dierent semiclassical descriptions are valid. we may repeat the same
inequalities as in d = 7 to dene the limits ho, i, ia, ia2, ia3. but for m-theory on k3
we must add one more condition to the constraint (2.4): a new circle has been added
and its size should be also greater than leleven
planck. for the new limit of the type iia strings
on k3 we encounter similar problems as in the case of the m-theory on k3. furthermore
if we use the denition (2.6) and postulate this shortest distance to be greater than the
type iia string length, we do not seem to get a consistent picture covering the whole
moduli space. similarly for d = 5, there appear two new asymptotic descriptions,
namely type ia5 theory and type iib strings on k3 s 1. it is clear that the condition
gia5 < 1 means part of the parameter space is not understood and another description,
most probably type iib strings on k3  s 1, must be used. unfortunately at this
moment we are not able to show that the condition for the iib theory on k3 to be
valid is complementary to the condition gia5 < 1. a straightforward application of
(2.9) already for the type iia theory on a k3 gives us a dierent inequality. our lack
of understanding of the limits for d < 7 might be solved by employing a correct t-
duality of the type iia on k3 but we do not have a complete and consistent picture at
this time.

2.5 type ia6 and s-duality in d = 4

let us turn to the questions that we understand better. as we have already said, in
d = 4 we see the z2 subgroup of the sl(2, z) s-duality which acts as p10  p10

13

and p1, . . . , p6 xed in our formalism. this reection divides the p-space to subregions
p10 > 0 and p10 < 0 which will be exchanged by the s-duality. this implies that a
new description should require p10 > 0. fortunately this is precisely what happens: in
d = 4 we have one new limit, namely the type ia6 strings and the condition (2.2) for
gia6 < 1 gives

or p10 > 0.

4p0  2

6

xi=1

pi = 2p10 < 0

(2.10)

gauge

in the case of d = 3 we nd also a fundamental domain that is copied several times
by s-dualities. this fundamental region is again bounded by the condition gef f.4dim
<
1 which is the same like gia6 < 1 and the internal structure has been partly described:
the fundamental region is divided into several subregions ho, type i, type iak, m/k3,
iia/k3, iib/k3. as we have said, we do not understand the limits with a k3 geometry
well enough to separate the fundamental region into the subregions enumerated above.
we are not even sure whether those limits are sucient to cover the whole parameter
space. in the case of e8  e8 theory, we are pretty sure that there are some limits that
we do not understand already for d = 9 and similar claim can be true in the case of the
so(32) vacua for d < 7. we understand much better how the entire parameter space
can be divided into the copies of the fundamental region and we want to concentrate
on this question.

gauge

the inequality gef f.4dim

< 1 should hold independently of which of the six radii
are chosen to be the radii of the six-torus. in other words, it must hold for the smallest
radii and the condition is again (2.10) which can be for d = 3 reexpressed as p7 < p10.
so the last limit at the boundary of the fundamental region is again type ia6
and not type ia7, for instance. it is easy to show that the condition gia6 < 1 is implied
by any of the conditions for the other limits so this condition is the weakest of all: all
the regions are inside gia6 < 1.

this should not be surprising, since gef f.4dim

ia6 ; the heterotic
s-duality in this type ia6 limit can be identied with the s-duality of the eective
low-energy description of the d3-branes of the type ia6 theory. as we have already
said, this inequality reads for d = 3

= (gia6)1/2 = gopen

gauge

2p0 

6

xi=1

pi = p10 + p7 < 0

(2.11)

or p10 > p7. we know that precisely in d = 3 the s-duality (more precisely the st 6
transformation) acts as the permutation of p7 and p10. therefore it is not hard to
see what to do if we want to reach the fundamental domain: we change all signs to

14

pluses by t-dualities and sort all eight numbers p1, . . . p7; p10 in the ascending order.
the inequality (2.11) will be then satised. the condition gef f.4dim
< 1 or (2.10) will
dene the fundamental region also for the case of one or two dimensions.

gauge

2.6 the innite groups in d  2
in the dimensions d > 2 the bilinear form is positive denite and the group of dualities
conserves the lattice z11d in the p-space. therefore the groups are nite. however for
d = 2 (and a fortiori for d = 1 because the d = 2 group is isomorphic to a subgroup
of the d = 1 group) the group becomes innite. in this dimension p10 is unchanged by
t-dualities and s-dualities. the regions with p10  0 again correspond to mysterious
regions where the holographic principle appears to be violated, as in [1]. thus we may
assume that p10 = 1; the overall normalization does not matter.

start for instance with p10 = 1 and

(p1, p2, . . . p8) = (0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0)

(2.12)

and perform the s-duality (st 6 from the formula (1.15)) with p7 and p8 understood
as the large dimensions (and p1 . . . p6 as the 6-torus). this transformation maps p7 7
p10  p8 and p8 7 p10  p7. so if we repeat st 6 on p7, p8, t-duality of p7, p8, st 6, t 2
and so on, p1 . . . p6 will be still zero and the values of p7, p8 are

(p7, p8) = (1, 1)  (1,1)  (2, 2)  (2,2)  (3, 3)  . . .

(2.13)

and thus grow linearly to innity, proving the innite order of the group. the equation
for gia6 < 1 now gives

2p0 

6

xi=1

pi = p10 + p7 + p8 < 0

(2.14)

or p10 > p7 +p8. now it is clear how to get to such a fundamental region with (2.14) and
0 < p1 < . . . p8. we repeat the st 6 transformation with the two largest radii (p7, p8)
as the large coordinates. after each step we turn the signs to + by t-dualities and
order p1 < . . . < p8 by permutations of radii. a bilinear quantity decreases assuming
p10 > 0 and p10 < p7 + p8 much like in [1], the case k = 9 (d = 2):

cd=2 =

8

xi=1

(pi)2 

8

xi=1

(pi)2 + 2p10(p10  (p7 + p8))

(2.15)

in the same way as in [1], starting with a rational approximation of a vector ~p, the
quantity cd=2 cannot decrease indenitely and therefore nally we must get to a point
with p10 > p7 + p8.

15

in the case d = 1 the bilinear form has a minkowski signature. the fundamental

region is now limited by

2p0 

6

xi=1

pi = p10 + p7 + p8 + p9 < 0

(2.16)

and it is easy to see that under the st 6 transformation on radii p1 . . . p6, p10 transforms
as

p10  2p10  (p7 + p8 + p9).

(2.17)

since the st 6 transformation is a reection of a spatial coordinate in all cases, it keeps
us inside the future light cone if we start there. furthermore, after each step we make
such t-dualities and permutations to ensure 0 < p1 < . . . p9.

if the initial p10 is greater than [(p1)2 + . . . + (p9)2]1/2 (and therefore positive), it
remains positive and assuming p10 < p7 + p8 + p9, it decreases according to (2.17). but
it cannot decrease indenitely (if we approximate ps by rational numbers or integers
after a scale transformation). so at some point the assumption p10 < p7 + p8 + p9 must
break down and we reach the conclusion that fundamental domain is characterized by
p10 > p7 + p8 + p9.

2.7 the lattices

in the maximally supersymmetric case [1], we encountered exceptional algebras and
their corresponding lattices. we were able to see some properties of the weyl group of
the exceptional algebra e10 and dene its fundamental domain in the cartan subalge-
bra. in the present case with 16 supersymmetries, the structure of lattices for d > 2 is
not as rich. the dualities always map integer vectors pi onto integer vectors.

for d > 4, there are no s-dualities and our t-dualities know about the group
o(26 d, 10 d, z). for d = 4 our group contains an extra z2 factor from the single s-
duality. for d = 3 they unify to a larger group o(8, 24, z). we have seen the semidirect
product of (z2)8 and s8 related to its weyl group in our formalism. for d = 2 the
equations of motion exhibit a larger ane o(8, 24) algebra whose discrete duality group
has been studied in [3].

in d = 1 our bilinear form has minkowski signature. the s-duality can be inter-

preted as a reection with respect to the vector

(p1, p2, . . . , p9, p10) = (0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,1,1,1, +1).

(2.18)

this is a spatial vector with length-squared equal to minus two (the form (1.3) has
a time-like signature). as we have seen, such reections generate together with t-
dualities an innite group which is an evidence for an underlying hyperbolic algebra

16

analogous to e10. indeed, ganor [5] has argued that the de18 hyperbolic algebra
underlies the nonperturbative duality group of maximally compactied heterotic string
theory. the cartan algebra of this dynkin diagram unies the asymptotic directions
which we have studied with compact internal symmetry directions. its cartan metric
has one negative signature direction.

3. conclusions

the parallel structure of the moduli spaces with 32 and 16 susys gives us reassur-
ance that the features uncovered in [1] are general properties of m-theory. it would
be interesting to extend these arguments to moduli spaces with less susy. unfortu-
nately, we know of no algebraic characterization of the moduli space of m-theory on
a calabi yau threefold. furthermore, this moduli space is no longer an orbifold. it
is stratied, with moduli spaces of dierent dimensions connecting to each other via
extremal transitions. furthermore, in general the metric on moduli space is no longer
protected by nonrenormalization theorems, and we are far from a characterization of
all the extreme regions. for the case of four susys the situation is even worse, for
most of what we usually think of as the moduli space actually has a superpotential on
it, which generically is of order the fundamental scale of the theory. 4

there are thus many hurdles to be jumped before we can claim that the concepts

discussed here and in [1] have a practical application to realistic cosmologies.
