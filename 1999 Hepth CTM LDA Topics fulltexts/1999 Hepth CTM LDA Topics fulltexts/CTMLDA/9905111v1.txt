abstract

we review the holographic correspondence between eld theories and string/m theory,
focusing on the relation between compactications of string/m theory on anti-de sitter
spaces and conformal eld theories. we review the background for this correspondence
and discuss its motivations and the evidence for its correctness. we describe the main
results that have been derived from the correspondence in the regime that the eld
theory is approximated by classical or semiclassical gravity. we focus on the case of
the n = 4 supersymmetric gauge theory in four dimensions, but we discuss also eld
theories in other dimensions, conformal and non-conformal, with or without supersym-
metry, and in particular the relation to qcd. we also discuss some implications for
black hole physics.

introduction

1.1 general introduction and overview

the microscopic description of nature as presently understood and veried by experi-
ment involves quantum eld theories. all particles are excitations of some eld. these
particles are pointlike and they interact locally with other particles. even though
quantum eld theories describe nature at the distance scales we observe, there are
strong indications that new elements will be involved at very short distances (or very
high energies), distances of the order of the planck scale. the reason is that at those
distances (or energies) quantum gravity eects become important.
it has not been
possible to quantize gravity following the usual perturbative methods. nevertheless,
one can incorporate quantum gravity in a consistent quantum theory by giving up the
notion that particles are pointlike and assuming that the fundamental objects in the
theory are strings, namely one-dimensional extended objects [1, 2]. these strings can
oscillate, and there is a spectrum of energies, or masses, for these oscillating strings.
the oscillating strings look like localized, particle-like excitations to a low energy ob-
server. so, a single oscillating string can eectively give rise to many types of particles,
depending on its state of oscillation. all string theories include a particle with zero
mass and spin two. strings can interact by splitting and joining interactions. the only
consistent interaction for massless spin two particles is that of gravity. therefore, any
string theory will contain gravity. the structure of string theory is highly constrained.
string theories do not make sense in an arbitrary number of dimensions or on any
arbitrary geometry. flat space string theory exists (at least in perturbation theory)
only in ten dimensions. actually, 10-dimensional string theory is described by a string
which also has fermionic excitations and gives rise to a supersymmetric theory.1 string
theory is then a candidate for a quantum theory of gravity. one can get down to four

1one could consider a string with no fermionic excitations, the so called bosonic string. it lives

in 26 dimensions and contains tachyons, signaling an instability of the theory.

4

dimensions by considering string theory on r4  m6 where m6 is some six dimensional
compact manifold. then, low energy interactions are determined by the geometry of
m6.

even though this is the motivation usually given for string theory nowadays, it is
not how string theory was originally discovered. string theory was discovered in an
attempt to describe the large number of mesons and hadrons that were experimentally
discovered in the 1960s. the idea was to view all these particles as dierent oscillation
modes of a string. the string idea described well some features of the hadron spectrum.
for example, the mass of the lightest hadron with a given spin obeys a relation like
m2  t j 2 + const. this is explained simply by assuming that the mass and angular
momentum come from a rotating, relativistic string of tension t . it was later discovered
that hadrons and mesons are actually made of quarks and that they are described by
qcd.

qcd is a gauge theory based on the group su(3). this is sometimes stated by saying
that quarks have three colors. qcd is asymptotically free, meaning that the eective
coupling constant decreases as the energy increases. at low energies qcd becomes
strongly coupled and it is not easy to perform calculations. one possible approach
is to use numerical simulations on the lattice. this is at present the best available
tool to do calculations in qcd at low energies. it was suggested by t hooft that the
theory might simplify when the number of colors n is large [3]. the hope was that one
could solve exactly the theory with n = , and then one could do an expansion in
1/n = 1/3. furthermore, as explained in the next section, the diagrammatic expansion
of the eld theory suggests that the large n theory is a free string theory and that
the string coupling constant is 1/n.
if the case with n = 3 is similar to the case
with n =  then this explains why the string model gave the correct relation between
the mass and the angular momentum. in this way the large n limit connects gauge
theories with string theories. the t hooft argument, reviewed below, is very general,
so it suggests that dierent kinds of gauge theories will correspond to dierent string
theories. in this review we will study this correspondence between string theories and
the large n limit of eld theories. we will see that the strings arising in the large n
limit of eld theories are the same as the strings describing quantum gravity. namely,
string theory in some backgrounds, including quantum gravity, is equivalent (dual) to
a eld theory.

we said above that strings are not consistent in four at dimensions. indeed, if one
wants to quantize a four dimensional string theory an anomaly appears that forces the
introduction of an extra eld, sometimes called the liouville eld [4]. this eld on
the string worldsheet may be interpreted as an extra dimension, so that the strings
eectively move in ve dimensions. one might qualitatively think of this new eld as
the thickness of the string. if this is the case, why do we say that the string moves

5

in ve dimensions ? the reason is that like any string theory, this theory will contain
gravity, and the gravitational theory will live in as many dimensions as the number of
elds we have on the string. it is crucial then that the ve dimensional geometry is
curved, so that it can correspond to a four dimensional eld theory, as described in
detail below.

the argument that gauge theories are related to string theories in the large n limit
in particular we could
is very general and is valid for basically any gauge theory.
consider a gauge theory where the coupling does not run (as a function of the energy
scale). then, the theory is conformally invariant. it is quite hard to nd quantum eld
theories that are conformally invariant.
in supersymmetric theories it is sometimes
possible to prove exact conformal invariance. a simple example, which will be the
main example in this review, is the supersymmetric su(n) (or u(n)) gauge theory in
four dimensions with four spinor supercharges (n = 4). four is the maximal possible
number of supercharges for a eld theory in four dimensions. besides the gauge elds
(gluons) this theory contains also four fermions and six scalar elds in the adjoint
representation of the gauge group. the lagrangian of such theories is completely
determined by supersymmetry. there is a global su(4) r-symmetry that rotates the
six scalar elds and the four fermions. the conformal group in four dimensions is
so(4, 2), including the usual poincare transformations as well as scale transformations
and special conformal transformations (which include the inversion symmetry x 
x/x2). these symmetries of the eld theory should be reected in the dual string
theory. the simplest way for this to happen is if the ve dimensional geometry has these
symmetries. locally there is only one space with so(4, 2) isometries: ve dimensional
anti-de-sitter space, or ads5. anti-de sitter space is the maximally symmetric solution
of einsteins equations with a negative cosmological constant. in this supersymmetric
case we expect the strings to also be supersymmetric. we said that superstrings move
in ten dimensions. now that we have added one more dimension it is not surprising any
more to add ve more to get to a ten dimensional space. since the gauge theory has
an su(4)  so(6) global symmetry it is rather natural that the extra ve dimensional
space should be a ve sphere, s5. so, we conclude that n = 4 u(n) yang-mills theory
could be the same as ten dimensional superstring theory on ads5  s5 [5]. here we
have presented a very heuristic argument for this equivalence, later we will be more
precise and give more evidence for this correspondence.

the relationship we described between gauge theories and string theory on anti-de-
sitter spaces was motivated by studies of d-branes and black holes in strings theory.
d-branes are solitons in string theory [6]. they come in various dimensionalities. if
they have zero spatial dimensions they are like ordinary localized, particle-type soliton
solutions, analogous to the t hooft-polyakov [7, 8] monopole in gauge theories. these
are called d-zero-branes. if they have one extended dimension they are called d-one-

6

branes or d-strings. they are much heavier than ordinary fundamental strings when
the string coupling is small. in fact, the tension of all d-branes is proportional to 1/gs,
where gs is the string coupling constant. d-branes are dened in string perturbation
theory in a very simple way: they are surfaces where open strings can end. these
open strings have some massless modes, which describe the oscillations of the branes,
a gauge eld living on the brane, and their fermionic partners. if we have n coincident
branes the open strings can start and end on dierent branes, so they carry two indices
that run from one to n. this in turn implies that the low energy dynamics is described
by a u(n) gauge theory. d-p-branes are charged under p + 1-form gauge potentials,
in the same way that a 0-brane (particle) can be charged under a one-form gauge
potential (as in electromagnetism). these p + 1-form gauge potentials have p + 2-form
eld strengths, and they are part of the massless closed string modes, which belong to
the supergravity (sugra) multiplet containing the massless elds in at space string
theory (before we put in any d-branes). if we now add d-branes they generate a ux of
the corresponding eld strength, and this ux in turn contributes to the stress energy
tensor so the geometry becomes curved. indeed it is possible to nd solutions of the
supergravity equations carrying these uxes. supergravity is the low-energy limit of
string theory, and it is believed that these solutions may be extended to solutions of
the full string theory. these solutions are very similar to extremal charged black hole
solutions in general relativity, except that in this case they are black branes with p
extended spatial dimensions. like black holes they contain event horizons.

if we consider a set of n coincident d-3-branes the near horizon geometry turns out
to be ads5  s5. on the other hand, the low energy dynamics on their worldvolume is
governed by a u(n) gauge theory with n = 4 supersymmetry. these two pictures of
d-branes are perturbatively valid for dierent regimes in the space of possible coupling
constants. perturbative eld theory is valid when gsn is small, while the low-energy
gravitational description is perturbatively valid when the radius of curvature is much
larger than the string scale, which turns out to imply that gsn should be very large. as
an object is brought closer and closer to the black brane horizon its energy measured
by an outside observer is redshifted, due to the large gravitational potential, and the
energy seems to be very small. on the other hand low energy excitations on the
branes are governed by the yang-mills theory. so, it becomes natural to conjecture
that yang-mills theory at strong coupling is describing the near horizon region of
the black brane, whose geometry is ads5  s5. the rst indications that this is the
case came from calculations of low energy graviton absorption cross sections [9, 10,
11]. it was noticed there that the calculation done using gravity and the calculation
done using super yang-mills theory agreed. these calculations, in turn, were inspired
by similar calculations for coincident d1-d5 branes.
in this case the near horizon
geometry involves ads3  s3 and the low energy eld theory living on the d-branes

7

is a 1+1 dimensional conformal eld theory. in this d1-d5 case there were numerous
calculations that agreed between the eld theory and gravity. first black hole entropy
for extremal black holes was calculated in terms of the eld theory in [12], and then
agreement was shown for near extremal black holes [13, 14] and for absorption cross
sections [15, 16, 17]. more generally, we will see that correlation functions in the gauge
theory can be calculated using the string theory (or gravity for large gsn) description,
by considering the propagation of particles between dierent points in the boundary
of ads, the points where operators are inserted [18, 19].

supergravities on ads spaces were studied very extensively, see [20, 21] for reviews.
one of the main points of this review will be that the strings coming from gauge
theories are very much like the ordinary superstrings that have been studied during the
last 20 years. the only particular feature is that they are moving on a curved geometry
(anti-de sitter space) which has a boundary at spatial innity. the boundary is at an
innite spatial distance, but a light ray can go to the boundary and come back in nite
time. massive particles can never get to the boundary. the radius of curvature of
anti-de sitter space depends on n so that large n corresponds to a large radius of
curvature. thus, by taking n to be large we can make the curvature as small as we
want. the theory in ads includes gravity, since any string theory includes gravity. so
in the end we claim that there is an equivalence between a gravitational theory and a
eld theory. however, the mapping between the gravitational and eld theory degrees
of freedom is quite non-trivial since the eld theory lives in a lower dimension. in some
sense the eld theory (or at least the set of local observables in the eld theory) lives
on the boundary of spacetime. one could argue that in general any quantum gravity
theory in ads denes a conformal eld theory (cft) on the boundary. in some
sense the situation is similar to the correspondence between three dimensional chern-
simons theory and a wzw model on the boundary [22]. this is a topological theory in
three dimensions that induces a normal (non-topological) eld theory on the boundary.
a theory which includes gravity is in some sense topological since one is integrating
over all metrics and therefore the theory does not depend on the metric. similarly,
in a quantum gravity theory we do not have any local observables. notice that when
we say that the theory includes gravity on ads we are considering any nite energy
excitation, even black holes in ads. so this is really a sum over all spacetimes that are
asymptotic to ads at the boundary. this is analogous to the usual at space discussion
of quantum gravity, where asymptotic atness is required, but the spacetime could have
any topology as long as it is asymptotically at. the asymptotically ads case as well
as the asymptotically at cases are special in the sense that one can choose a natural
time and an associated hamiltonian to dene the quantum theory. since black holes
might be present this time coordinate is not necessarily globally well-dened, but it is
certainly well-dened at innity. if we assume that the conjecture we made above is

8

valid, then the u(n) yang-mills theory gives a non-perturbative denition of string
theory on ads. and, by taking the limit n  , we can extract the (ten dimensional
string theory) at space physics, a procedure which is in principle (but not in detail)
similar to the one used in matrix theory [23].

the fact that the eld theory lives in a lower dimensional space blends in perfectly
with some previous speculations about quantum gravity.
it was suggested [24, 25]
that quantum gravity theories should be holographic, in the sense that physics in some
region can be described by a theory at the boundary with no more than one degree of
freedom per planck area. this holographic principle comes from thinking about the
bekenstein bound which states that the maximum amount of entropy in some region
is given by the area of the region in planck units [26]. the reason for this bound is
that otherwise black hole formation could violate the second law of thermodynamics.
we will see that the correspondence between eld theories and string theory on ads
space (including gravity) is a concrete realization of this holographic principle.

the review is organized as follows.
in the rest of the introductory chapter, we present background material. in section
1.2, we present the t hooft large n limit and its indication that gauge theories may
be dual to string theories. in section 1.3, we review the p-brane supergravity solutions.
we discuss d-branes, their worldvolume theory and their relation to the p-branes. we
discuss greybody factors and their calculation for black holes built out of d-branes.

in chapter 2, we review conformal eld theories and ads spaces. in section 2.1, we
give a brief description of conformal eld theories. in section 2.2, we summarize the
geometry of ads spaces and gauged supergravities.

in chapter 3, we derive the correspondence between supersymmetric yang mills
theory and string theory on ads5  s5 from the physics of d3-branes in string the-
ory. we dene, in section 3.1, the correspondence between elds in the string theory
and operators of the conformal eld theory and the prescription for the computation
of correlation functions. we also point out that the correspondence gives an explicit
holographic description of gravity. in section 3.2, we review the direct tests of the dual-
ity, including matching the spectrum of chiral primary operators and some correlation
functions and anomalies. computation of correlation functions is reviewed in section
3.3. the isomorphism of the hilbert spaces of string theory on ads spaces and of
cfts is decribed in section 3.4. we describe how to introduce wilson loop operators
in section 3.5. in section 3.6, we analyze nite temperature theories and the thermal
phase transtion.

in chapter 4, we review other topics involving ads5.

in section 4.1, we consider
some other gauge theories that arise from d-branes at orbifolds, orientifolds, or conifold
points. in section 4.2, we review how baryons and instantons arise in the string theory

1.2 large n gauge theories as string theories

the relation between gauge theories and string theories has been an interesting topic
of research for over three decades. string theory was originally developed as a theory
for the strong interactions, due to various string-like aspects of the strong interactions,
such as connement and regge behavior. it was later realized that there is another
description of the strong interactions, in terms of an su(3) gauge theory (qcd), which
is consistent with all experimental data to date. however, while the gauge theory de-
scription is very useful for studying the high-energy behavior of the strong interactions,
it is very dicult to use it to study low-energy issues such as connement and chiral
symmetry breaking (the only current method for addressing these issues in the full
non-abelian gauge theory is by numerical simulations).
in the last few years many
examples of the phenomenon generally known as duality have been discovered, in
which a single theory has (at least) two dierent descriptions, such that when one
description is weakly coupled the other is strongly coupled and vice versa (examples of
this phenomenon in two dimensional eld theories have been known for many years).
one could hope that a similar phenomenon would apply in the theory of the strong
interactions, and that a dual description of qcd exists which would be more ap-
propriate for studying the low-energy regime where the gauge theory description is
strongly coupled.

there are several indications that this dual description could be a string the-
ory. qcd has in it string-like objects which are the ux tubes or wilson lines.
if
we try to separate a quark from an anti-quark, a ux tube forms between them (if

10

0 adx)(x) is gauge-invariant).

(0)p exp(ir x

 is a quark eld, the operator (0)(x) is not gauge-invariant but the operator
in many ways these ux tubes be-
have like strings, and there have been many attempts to write down a string theory
describing the strong interactions in which the ux tubes are the basic objects.
it
is clear that such a stringy description would have many desirable phenomenological
attributes since, after all, this is how string theory was originally discovered. the most
direct indication from the gauge theory that it could be described in terms of a string
theory comes from the t hooft large n limit [3], which we will now describe in detail.
yang-mills (ym) theories in four dimensions have no dimensionless parameters, since
the gauge coupling is dimensionally transmuted into the qcd scale qcd (which is the
only mass scale in these theories). thus, there is no obvious perturbation expansion
that can be performed to learn about the physics near the scale qcd. however, an
additional parameter of su(n) gauge theories is the integer number n, and one may
hope that the gauge theories may simplify at large n (despite the larger number of
degrees of freedom), and have a perturbation expansion in terms of the parameter 1/n.
this turns out to be true, as shown by t hooft based on the following analysis (reviews
of large n qcd may be found in [31, 32]).

first, we need to understand how to scale the coupling gy m as we take n  .
in an asymptotically free theory, like pure ym theory, it is natural to scale gy m so
that qcd remains constant in the large n limit. the beta function equation for pure
su(n) ym theory is



dgy m
d

11
3

n

= 

g3
y m
162 + o(g5

y m ),

(1.1)

so the leading terms are of the same order for large n if we take n   while keeping
  g2
y m n xed (one can show that the higher order terms are also of the same order
in this limit). this is known as the t hooft limit. the same behavior is valid if we
include also matter elds (fermions or scalars) in the adjoint representation, as long as
the theory is still asymptotically free. if the theory is conformal, such as the n = 4
sym theory which we will discuss in detail below, it is not obvious that the limit of
constant  is the only one that makes sense, and indeed we will see that other limits, in
which   , are also possible. however, the limit of constant  is still a particularly
interesting limit and we will focus on it in the remainder of this chapter.

instead of focusing just on the ym theory, let us describe a general theory which
has some elds a
i , where a is an index in the adjoint representation of su(n), and i
is some label of the eld (a spin index, a avor index, etc.). some of these elds can
be ghost elds (as will be the case in gauge theory). we will assume that as in the
ym theory (and in the n = 4 sym theory), the 3-point vertices of all these elds are
proportional to gy m , and the 4-point functions to g2
y m , so the lagrangian is of the

11

schematic form

l  tr(didi) + gy m cijktr(ijk) + g2

y m dijkltr(ijkl),

(1.2)

for some constants cijk and dijkl (where we have assumed that the interactions are
su(n)-invariant; mass terms can also be added and do not change the analysis).
rescaling the elds by i  gy m i, the lagrangian becomes

l 

1
g2

y m htr(d id i) + cijktr( i j k) + dijkltr( i j k l)i ,

(1.3)

with a coecient of 1/g2

y m = n/ in front of the whole lagrangian.

now, we can ask what happens to correlation functions in the limit of large n
with constant . naively, this is a classical limit since the coecient in front of the
lagrangian diverges, but in fact this is not true since the number of components in
the elds also goes to innity in this limit. we can write the feynman diagrams of
the theory (1.3) in a double line notation, in which an adjoint eld a is represented
as a direct product of a fundamental and an anti-fundamental eld, i
j, as in gure
1.1. the interaction vertices we wrote are all consistent with this sort of notation. the
propagators are also consistent with it in a u(n) theory, in an su(n) theory there is
a small mixing term

which makes the expansion slightly more complicated, but this involves only subleading
terms in the large n limit so we will neglect this dierence here. ignoring the second
term the propagator for the adjoint eld is (in terms of the index structure) like that of a
fundamental-anti-fundamental pair. thus, any feynman diagram of adjoint elds may
be viewed as a network of double lines. let us begin by analyzing vacuum diagrams
(the generalization to adding external elds is simple and will be discussed below). in
such a diagram we can view these double lines as forming the edges in a simplicial
decomposition (for example, it could be a triangulation) of a surface, if we view each
single-line loop as the perimeter of a face of the simplicial decomposition. the resulting
surface will be oriented since the lines have an orientation (in one direction for a
fundamental index and in the opposite direction for an anti-fundamental index). when
we compactify space by adding a point at innity, each diagram thus corresponds to a
compact, closed, oriented surface.

what is the power of n and  associated with such a diagram ? from the form
of (1.3) it is clear that each vertex carries a coecient proportional to n/, while
propagators are proportional to /n. additional powers of n come from the sum over
the indices in the loops, which gives a factor of n for each loop in the diagram (since
each index has n possible values). thus, we nd that a diagram with v vertices, e

figure 1.1: some diagrams in a eld theory with adjoint elds in the standard repre-
sentation (on the left) and in the double line representation (on the right). the dashed
lines are propagators for the adjoint elds, the small circles represent interaction ver-
tices, and solid lines carry indices in the fundamental representation.

propagators (= edges in the simplicial decomposition) and f loops (= faces in the
simplicial decomposition) comes with a coecient proportional to

n v e+f ev = n ev ,

(1.5)

where   v e +f is the euler character of the surface corresponding to the diagram.
for closed oriented surfaces,  = 2  2g where g is the genus (the number of handles)
of the surface2. thus, the perturbative expansion of any diagram in the eld theory
may be written as a double expansion of the form

xg=0

n 22g xi=0

cg,ii =

xg=0

n 22gfg(),

(1.6)

where fg is some polynomial in  (in an asymptotically free theory the -dependence
will turn into some qcd-dependence but the general form is similar; infrared diver-
gences could also lead to the appearance of terms which are not integer powers of ).
in the large n limit we see that any computation will be dominated by the surfaces
of maximal  or minimal genus, which are surfaces with the topology of a sphere (or

2we are discussing here only connected diagrams, for disconnected diagrams we have similar con-

tributions from each connected component.

13

equivalently a plane). all these planar diagrams will give a contribution of order n 2,
while all other diagrams will be suppressed by powers of 1/n 2. for example, the rst
diagram in gure 1.1 is planar and proportional to n 23+3 = n 2, while the second one
is not and is proportional to n 46+2 = n 0. we presented our analysis for a general
theory, but in particular it is true for any gauge theory coupled to adjoint matter elds,
like the n = 4 sym theory. the rest of our discussion will be limited mostly to gauge
theories, where only gauge-invariant (su(n)-invariant) objects are usually of interest.
the form of the expansion (1.6) is the same as one nds in a perturbative theory
with closed oriented strings, if we identify 1/n as the string coupling constant3. of
course, we do not really see any strings in the expansion, but just diagrams with holes
in them; however, one can hope that in a full non-perturbative description of the eld
theory the holes will close and the surfaces of the feynman diagrams will become
actual closed surfaces. the analogy of (1.6) with perturbative string theory is one
of the strongest motivations for believing that eld theories and string theories are
related, and it suggests that this relation would be more visible in the large n limit
where the dual string theory may be weakly coupled. however, since the analysis
was based on perturbation theory which generally does not converge, it is far from a
rigorous derivation of such a relation, but rather an indication that it might apply,
at least for some eld theories (there are certainly also eects like instantons which
are non-perturbative in the 1/n expansion, and an exact matching with string theory
would require a matching of such eects with non-perturbative eects in string theory).
the fact that 1/n behaves as a coupling constant in the large n limit can also be
seen directly in the eld theory analysis of the t hooft limit. while we have derived the
behavior (1.6) only for vacuum diagrams, it actually holds for any correlation function

a product of two gauge-invariant elds (for instance, gj can be of the form 1

of a product of gauge-invariant eldsdqn
j=1 gje such that each gj cannot be written as
n tr(qi i)).
we can study such a correlation function by adding to the action s  s + np gjgj,

and then, if w is the sum of connected vacuum diagrams we discussed above (but now
computed with the new action),

* nyj=1

gj+ = (in)n" nw
j=1 gj#gj=0
qn

.

(1.7)

our analysis of the vacuum diagrams above holds also for these diagrams, since we
put in additional vertices with a factor of n, and, in the double line representation,
each of the operators we inserted becomes a vertex of the simplicial decomposition
of the surface (this would not be true for operators which are themselves products,

3in the conformal case, where  is a free parameter, there is actually a freedom of choosing the
string coupling constant to be 1/n times any function of  without changing the form of the expansion,
and this will be used below.

14

and which would correspond to more than one vertex). thus, the leading contribution

j=1 gje will come from planar diagrams with n additional operator insertions,

to dqn

leading to

* nyj=1

gj+  n 2n

(1.8)

in the t hooft limit. we see that (in terms of powers of n) the 2-point functions of the
gjs come out to be canonically normalized, while 3-point functions are proportional
to 1/n, so indeed 1/n is the coupling constant in this limit (higher genus diagrams
do not aect this conclusion since they just add higher order terms in 1/n). in the
string theory analogy the operators gj would become vertex operators inserted on the
string world-sheet. for asymptotically free conning theories (like qcd) one can show
that in the large n limit they have an innite spectrum of stable particles with rising
masses (as expected in a free string theory). many additional properties of the large
n limit are discussed in [33, 31] and other references.

the analysis we did of the t hooft limit for su(n) theories with adjoint elds
can easily be generalized to other cases. matter in the fundamental representation
appears as single-line propagators in the diagrams, which correspond to boundaries of
the corresponding surfaces. thus, if we have such matter we need to sum also over
surfaces with boundaries, as in open string theories. for so(n) or usp(n) gauge
theories we can represent the adjoint representation as a product of two fundamental
representations (instead of a fundamental and an anti-fundamental representation),
and the fundamental representation is real, so no arrows appear on the propagators in
the diagram, and the resulting surfaces may be non-orientable. thus, these theories
seem to be related to non-orientable string theories [34]. we will not discuss these cases
in detail here, some of the relevant aspects will be discussed in section 4.1.2 below.

our analysis thus far indicates that gauge theories may be dual to string theories
with a coupling proportional to 1/n in the t hooft limit, but it gives no indication as to
precisely which string theory is dual to a particular gauge theory. for two dimensional
gauge theories much progress has been made in formulating the appropriate string
theories [35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42], but for four dimensional gauge theories there was
no concrete construction of a corresponding string theory before the results reported
below, since the planar diagram expansion (which corresponds to the free string theory)
is very complicated. various direct approaches towards constructing the relevant string
theory were attempted, many of which were based on the loop equations [43] for the
wilson loop observables in the eld theory, which are directly connected to a string-
type description.

attempts to directly construct a string theory equivalent to a four dimensional gauge
theory are plagued with the well-known problems of string theory in four dimensions
(or generally below the critical dimension).
in particular, additional elds must be

15

added on the worldsheet beyond the four embedding coordinates of the string to ensure
consistency of the theory.
in the standard quantization of four dimensional string
theory an additional eld called the liouville eld arises [4], which may be interpreted
as a fth space-time dimension. polyakov has suggested [44, 45] that such a ve
dimensional string theory could be related to four dimensional gauge theories if the
couplings of the liouville eld to the other elds take some specic forms. as we will
see, the ads/cft correspondence realizes this idea, but with ve additional dimensions
(in addition to the radial coordinate on ads which can be thought of as a generalization
of the liouville eld), leading to a standard (critical) ten dimensional string theory.

1.3 black p-branes

the recent insight into the connection between large n eld theories and string theory
has emerged from the study of p-branes in string theory. the p-branes were originally
found as classical solutions to supergravity, which is the low energy limit of string
theory. later it was pointed out by polchinski that d-branes give their full string
theoretical description. various comparisons of the two descriptions have lead to the
discovery of the ads/cft correspondence.

1.3.1 classical solutions

string theory has a variety of classical solutions corresponding to extended black holes
[46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56]. complete descriptions of all possible black
hole solutions would be beyond the scope of this review, and we will discuss here only
illustrative examples corresponding to parallel dp branes. for a more extensive review
of extended objects in string theory, see [57, 58].

let us consider type ii string theory in ten dimensions, and look for a black hole
solution carrying electric charge with respect to the ramond-ramond (r-r) (p + 1)-
form ap+1 [47, 52, 55]. in type iia (iib) theory, p is even (odd). the theory contains
also magnetically charged (6 p)-branes, which are electrically charged under the dual
da7p = dap+1 potential. therefore, r-r charges have to be quantized according to
the dirac quantization condition. to nd the solution, we start with the low energy
eective action in the string frame,

s =

(1.9)

where ls is the string length, related to the string tension (2)1 as  = l2
s, and fp+2
is the eld strength of the (p + 1)-form potential, fp+2 = dap+1. in the self-dual case
of p = 3 we work directly with the equations of motion. we then look for a solution

16

corresponding to a p-dimensional electric source of charge n for ap+1, by requiring the
euclidean symmetry iso(p) in p-dimensions:

ds2 = ds2

10p + e

dxidxi.

pxi=1

(1.10)

here ds2
10p is a lorentzian-signature metric in (10  p)-dimensions. we also assume
that the metric is spherically symmetric in (10 p) dimensions with the r-r source at
the origin,

fp+2 = n,

(1.11)

zs 8p

where s8p is the (8  p)-sphere surrounding the source. by using the euclidean
symmetry iso(p), we can reduce the problem to the one of nding a spherically
symmetric charged black hole solution in (10p) dimensions [47, 52, 55]. the resulting
metric, in the string frame, is given by

the metric in the einstein frame, (ge), is dened by multiplying the string frame

p z d10xge (re

(1.17)

the einstein frame metric has a horizon at  = r+. for p  6, there is also a curvature
singularity at  = r. when r+ > r, the singularity is covered by the horizon and

17

the solution can be regarded as a black hole. when r+ < r, there is a timelike naked
singularity and the cauchy problem is not well-posed.

the situation is subtle in the critical case r+ = r.

if p 6= 3, the horizon and
the singularity coincide and there is a null singularity. moreover, the dilaton either
diverges or vanishes at  = r+. this singularity, however, is milder than in the case of
r+ < r, and the supergravity description is still valid up to a certain distance from
the singularity. the situation is much better for p = 3. in this case, the dilaton is
constant. moreover, the  = r+ surface is regular even when r+ = r, allowing a
smooth analytic extension beyond  = r+ [59].

according to (1.15), for a xed value of n, the mass m is an increasing function of
r+. the condition r+  r for the absence of the timelike naked singularity therefore
translates into an inequality between the mass m and the r-r charge n, of the form

m 

n

(2)pgslp+1

s

.

(1.18)

the solution whose mass m is at the lower bound of this inequality is called an extremal
p-brane. on the other hand, when m is strictly greater than that, we have a non-
extremal black p-brane. it is called black since there is an event horizon for r+ > r.
the area of the black hole horizon goes to zero in the extremal limit r+ = r. since
the extremal solution with p 6= 3 has a singularity, the supergravity description breaks
down near  = r+ and we need to use the full string theory. the d-brane construction
discussed below will give exactly such a description. the inequality (1.18) is also
the bps bound with respect to the 10-dimensional supersymmetry, and the extremal
solution r+ = r preserves one half of the supersymmetry in the regime where we can
trust the supergravity description. this suggests that the extremal p-brane is a ground
state of the black p-brane for a given charge n.

the extremal limit r+ = r of the solution (1.12) is given by

ds2 =qf+() dt2 +

pxi=1

dxidxi! + f+() 3

2 5p

7p d2 + 2f+()

2 5p

7p d2

8p.

(1.19)

in this limit, the symmetry of the metric is enhanced from the euclidean group iso(p)
to the poincare group iso(p, 1). this ts well with the interpretation that the extremal
solution corresponds to the ground state of the black p-brane. to describe the geometry
of the extremal solution outside of the horizon, it is often useful to dene a new
coordinate r by

and introduce the isotropic coordinates, ra = ra (a = 1, ..., 9  p; pa(a)2 = 1). the

in general, (1.21) and (1.22) give a solution to the supergravity equations of motion
for any function h(~r) which is a harmonic function in the (9  p) dimensions which
are transverse to the p-brane. for example, we may consider a more general solution,

this is called a multi-centered solution and represents parallel extremal p-branes lo-
cated at k dierent locations, ~r = ~ri (i = 1,   , k), each of which carries ni units of
the r-r charge.

so far we have discussed the black p-brane using the classical supergravity. this
description is appropriate when the curvature of the p-brane geometry is small com-
pared to the string scale, so that stringy corrections are negligible. since the strength
of the curvature is characterized by r+, this requires r+  ls. to suppress string loop
corrections, the eective string coupling e also needs to be kept small. when p = 3,
the dilaton is constant and we can make it small everywhere in the 3-brane geome-
try by setting gs < 1, namely lp < ls. if gs > 1 we might need to do an s-duality,
gs  1/gs, rst. moreover, in this case it is known that the metric (1.21) can be
analytically extended beyond the horizon r = 0, and that the maximally extended
metric is geodesically complete and without a singularity [59]. the strength of the cur-
vature is then uniformly bounded by r2
+ . to summarize, for p = 3, the supergravity
approximation is valid when

since r+ is related to the r-r charge n as

lp < ls  r+.

only in a limited region of the spacetime.

1.3.2 d-branes

alternatively, the extremal p-brane can be described as a d-brane. for a review of d-
branes, see [60]. the dp-brane is a (p + 1)-dimensional hyperplane in spacetime where
an open string can end. by the worldsheet duality, this means that the d-brane is also
a source of closed strings (see fig. 1.2). in particular, it can carry the r-r charges.
it was shown in [6] that, if we put n dp-branes on top of each other, the resulting
(p + 1)-dimensional hyperplane carries exactly n units of the (p + 1)-form charge. on
the worldsheet of a type ii string, the left-moving degrees of freedom and the right-
moving degrees of freedom carry separate spacetime supercharges. since the open
string boundary condition identies the left and right movers, the d-brane breaks at
least one half of the spacetime supercharges. in type iia (iib) string theory, precisely
one half of the supersymmetry is preserved if p is even (odd). this is consistent with
the types of r-r charges that appear in the theory. thus, the dp-brane is a bps object
in string theory which carries exactly the same charge as the black p-brane solution in
supergravity.

figure 1.2: (a) the d-brane is where open strings can end. (b) the d-brane is a source
of closed strings.

it is believed that the extremal p-brane in supergravity and the dp-brane are two
dierent descriptions of the same object. the d-brane uses the string worldsheet and,
therefore, is a good description in string perturbation theory. when there are n d-
branes on top of each other, the eective loop expansion parameter for the open strings
is gsn rather than gs, since each open string boundary loop ending on the d-branes
comes with the chan-paton factor n as well as the string coupling gs. thus, the d-
brane description is good when gsn  1. this is complementary to the regime (1.27)
where the supergravity description is appropriate.

the low energy eective theory of open strings on the dp-brane is the u(n) gauge

20

theory in (p + 1) dimensions with 16 supercharges [61]. the theory has (9  p) scalar
elds ~ in the adjoint representation of u(n). if the vacuum expectation value h~i has
k distinct eigenvalues4, with n1 identical eigenvalues ~1, n2 identical eigenvalues ~2
and so on, the gauge group u(n) is broken to u(n1)     u(nk). this corresponds
to the situation when n1 d-branes are at ~r1 = ~1l2
s, n2 dp-branes are at ~r2 = ~2l2
s,
and so on.
in this case, there are massive w -bosons for the broken gauge groups.
the w -boson in the bi-fundamental representation of u(ni)  u(nj) comes from the
open string stretching between the d-branes at ~ri and ~rj, and the mass of the w-
boson is proportional to the euclidean distance |~ri  ~rj| between the d-branes. it is
important to note that the same result is obtained if we use the supergravity solution
for the multi-centered p-brane (1.24) and compute the mass of the string going from
4 from the metric in the ~r-space (1.21) is cancelled by
~ri to ~rj, since the factor h(~r)
the redshift factor h(~r) 1
4 when converting the string tension into energy. both the
d-brane description and the supergravity solution give the same value of the w-boson
mass, since it is determined by the bps condition.

1.3.3 greybody factors and black holes

an important precursor to the ads/cft correspondence was the calculation of grey-
body factors for black holes built out of d-branes. it was noted in [13] that hawking
radiation could be mimicked by processes where two open strings collide on a d-brane
and form a closed string which propagates into the bulk. the classic computation of
hawking (see, for example, [62] for details) shows in a semi-classical approximation
that the dierential rate of spontaneous emission of particles of energy  from a black
hole is

where v is the velocity of the emitted particle in the transverse directions, and the sign
in the denominator is minus for bosons and plus for fermions. we use n to denote the
number of spatial dimensions around the black hole (or if we are dealing with a black
brane, it is the number of spatial dimensions perpendicular to the world-volume of the
brane). th is the hawking temperature, and absorb is the cross-section for a particle
coming in from innity to be absorbed by the black hole. in the dierential emission
rate, the emitted particle is required to have a momentum in a small region dnk, and
 is a function of k. to obtain a total emission rate we would integrate (1.28) over all
k.

if absorb were a constant, then (1.28) tells us that the emission spectrum is the same

4there is a potential pi,j tr[i , j ]2 for the scalar elds, so expectation values of the matrices
i (i = 1, , 9  p) minimizing the potential are simultaneously diagonalizable.

as that of a blackbody. typically, absorb is not constant, but varies appreciably over
the range of nite /th. the consequent deviations from the pure blackbody spectrum
have earned absorb the name greybody factor. a successful microscopic account of
black hole thermodynamics should be able to predict these greybody factors. in [15]
and its many successors, it was shown that the d-branes provided an account of black
hole microstates which was successful in this respect.

our rst goal will be to see how greybody factors are computed in the context of
quantum elds in curved spacetime. the literature on this subject is immense. we
refer the reader to [63] for an overview of the general relativity literature, and to
[17, 10, 58] and references therein for a rst look at the string theory additions.

in studying scattering of particles o of a black hole (or any xed target), it is con-
venient to make a partial wave expansion. for simplicity, let us restrict the discussion
to scalar elds. assuming that the black hole is spherically symmetric, one can write
the asymptotic behavior at innity of the time-independent scattering solution as

(~r)  eikx + f ()

x=0

p(cos )

(ikr)n/2

,

(1.29)

where x = r cos . the term eikx represents the incident wave, and the second term
in the rst line represents the scattered wave. the p(cos ) are generalizations of
legendre polynomials. the absorption probability for a given partial wave is given by
p = 1  |s|2. an application of the optical theorem leads to the absorption cross
section [64]

(1.30)

sometimes the absorption probability p is called the greybody factor.

the strategy of absorption calculations in supergravity is to solve a linearized wave
equation, most often the klein-gordon equation  = 0, using separation of variables,
 = eitp(cos )r(r). typically the radial function cannot be expressed in terms of
known functions, so some approximation scheme is used, as we will explain in more
detail below. boundary conditions are imposed at the black hole horizon corresponding
to infalling matter. once the solution is obtained, one can either use the asymptotics
(1.29) to obtain s and from it p and 
abs, or compute the particle ux at innity
and at the horizon and note that particle number conservation implies that p is their
ratio.

one of the few known universal results is that for /th  1, abs for an s-wave
massless scalar approaches the horizon area of the black hole [65]. this result holds

22

for any spherically symmetric black hole in any dimension. for  much larger than
any characteristic curvature scale of the geometry, one can use the geometric optics
approximation to nd abs.

we will be interested in the particular black hole geometries for which string theory
provides a candidate description of the microstates. let us start with n coincident
d3-branes, where the low-energy world-volume theory is d = 4 n = 4 u(n) gauge
is the laplacian for
theory. the equation of motion for the dilaton is
the metric

 = 0 where

r4!1/2(cid:16)dr2 + r2d2

5(cid:17) . (1.31)

it is convenient to change radial variables: r = rez,  = e2z. the radial equation
for the th partial wave is

z + 22r2 cosh 2z  ( + 2)2i (z) = 0 ,
h2

(1.32)

which is precisely schrodingers equation with a potential v (z) = 22r2 cosh 2z. the
absorption probability is precisely the tunneling probability for the barrier v (z): the
transmitted wave at large positive z represents particles falling into the d3-branes. at
leading order in small r, the absorption probability for the th partial wave is

p =

42

( + 1)!4( + 2)2(cid:18)r

2 (cid:19)8+4

.

(1.33)

this result, together with a recursive algorithm for computing all corrections as a series
in r, was obtained in [66] from properties of associated mathieu functions, which
are the solutions of (1.32). an exact solution of a radial equation in terms of known
special functions is rare. we will therefore present a standard approximation technique
(developed in [67] and applied to the problem at hand in [9]) which is sucient to obtain
the leading term of (1.33). besides, for comparison with string theory predictions we
are generally interested only in this leading term.

the idea is to nd limiting forms of the radial equation which can be solved exactly,
and then to match the limiting solutions together to approximate the full solution.
usually a uniformly good approximation can be found in the limit of small energy. the
reason, intuitively speaking, is that on a compact range of radii excluding asymptotic
innity and the horizon, the zero energy solution is nearly equal to solutions with very
small energy; and outside this region the wave equation usually has a simple limiting
form. so one solves the equation in various regions and then matches together a global
solution.

23

it is elementary to show that this can be done for (1.32) using two regions:

far region: z  log r

near region: z   log r

(z) = h (1)

z + 2r2e2z  ( + 2)2i  = 0
h2
z + 2r2e2z  ( + 2)2i  = 0
h2

+2(rez)

(z) = aj+2(rez)

(1.34)

it is amusing to note the z2 symmetry, z  z, which exchanges the far region,
where the rst equation in (1.34) is just free particle propagation in at space, and
the near region, where the second equation in (1.34) describes a free particle in ads5.
this peculiar symmetry was rst pointed out in [9]. it follows from the fact that the
full d3-brane metric comes back to itself, up to a conformal rescaling, if one sends
r  r2/r. a similar duality exists between six-dimensional at space and ads3  s3
in the d1-d5-brane solution, where the laplace equation again can be solved in terms
of mathieu functions [68, 69]. to our knowledge there is no deep understanding of this
inversion duality.

for low energies r  1, the near and far regions overlap in a large domain,
log r  z   log r, and by comparing the solutions in this overlap region one can
x a and reproduce the leading term in (1.33). it is possible but tedious to obtain the
leading correction by treating the small terms which were dropped from the potential
to obtain the limiting forms in (1.34) as perturbations. this strategy was pursued
in [70, 71] before the exact solution was known, and in cases where there is no exact
solution. the validity of the matching technique is discussed in [63], but we know of
no rigorous proof that it holds in all the circumstances in which it has been applied.

the successful comparison of the s-wave dilaton cross-section in [9] with a perturba-
tive calculation on the d3-brane world-volume was the rst hint that greens functions
of n = 4 super-yang-mills theory could be computed from supergravity. in summa-
rizing the calculation, we will follow more closely the conventions of [10], and give an
indication of the rst application of non-renormalization arguments [11] to understand
why the agreement between supergravity and perturbative gauge theory existed despite
their applicability in opposite limits of the t hooft coupling.

setting normalization conventions so that the pole in the propagator of the gauge
bosons has residue one at tree level, we have the following action for the dilaton plus
the elds on the brane:

s =

1

22 z d10xg hr  1

2()2 + . . .i +z d4x h 1

4 etrf 2

 + . . .i ,

(1.35)

where we have omitted other supergravity elds, their interactions with one another,
and also terms with the lower spin elds in the gauge theory action. a plane wave

24

of dilatons with energy  and momentum perpendicular to the brane is kinematically
equivalent on the world-volume to a massive particle which can decay into two gauge
bosons through the coupling 1
. in fact, the absorption cross-section is given
precisely by the usual expression for the decay rate into k particles:

.

(1.36)

in the feynman rules for m, a factor of 22 attaches to an external dilaton line on

account of the non-standard normalization of its kinetic term in (1.35). this factor
gives abs the correct dimensions: it is a length to the fth power, as appropriate for six
transverse spatial dimensions. in (1.36), |m|
indicates summation over distinguishable
processes: in the case of the s-wave dilaton there are n 2 such processes because of the
= n 224. sf is a symmetry
number of gauge bosons. one easily veries that |m|
factor for identical particles in the nal state: in the case of the s-wave dilaton, sf = 2
because the outgoing gauge bosons are identical.

carrying out the  = 0 calculation explicitly, one nds

abs =

n 223

32

,

(1.37)

which, using (1.30) and the relation between r and n, can be shown to be in precise
agreement with the leading term of p0 in (1.33). this is now understood to be due to
a non-renormalization theorem for the two-point function of the operator o4 = 1
4 trf 2.
to understand the connection with two-point functions, note that an absorption
calculation is insensitive to the nal state on the d-brane world-volume. the absorption
cross-section is therefore related to the discontinuity in the cut of the two-point function
of the operator to which the external eld couples. to state a result of some generality,
let us suppose that a scalar eld  in ten dimensions couples to a gauge theory operator
through the action

sint =z d4x yi1    yi

(x, yi)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)yi=0oi1...i(x) ,

(1.38)

where we use x to denote the four coordinates parallel to the world-volume and yi to
denote the other six. an example where this would be the right sort of coupling is the
th partial wave of the dilaton [10]. the th partial wave absorption cross-section for
a particle with initial momentum p = (t + y1) is obtained by summing over all nal

in the second equality we have applied the optical theorem (see gure 1.3). the
factor of 22 is the square of the external leg factor for the incoming closed string
state, which was included in the invariant amplitude m. the factor of  arises from
acting with the  derivatives in (1.38) on the incoming plane wave state. the symbol
disc indicates that one is looking at the unitarity cut in the two-point function in the
s plane, where s = p2. the two-point function can be reconstructed uniquely from
this cut, together with some weak conditions on regularity for large momenta. results
analogous to (1.39) can be stated for incoming particles with spin, only it becomes
more complicated because a polarization must be specied, and the two-point function
in momentum space includes a polynomial in p which depends on the polarization.

expressing absorption cross-sections in terms of two-point functions helps illustrate
why there is ever agreement between the tree-level calculation indicated in (1.36) and
the supergravity result, which one would a priori expect to pick up all sorts of ra-
diative corrections.
indeed, it was observed in [11] that the s-wave graviton cross-
section agreed between supergravity and tree-level gauge theory because the correlator
htti enjoys a non-renormalization theorem. one way to see that there must be
such a non-renormalization theorem is to note that conformal ward identities relate
this two-point function to ht 
 tti (see for example [72] for the details), and su-
persymmetry in turn relates this anomalous three-point function to the anomalous
vevs of the divergence of r-currents in the presence of external sources for them.
the adler-bardeen theorem [73] protects these anomalies, hence the conclusion.



another case which has been studied extensively is a system consisting of several
d1 and d5 branes. the d1-branes are delocalized on the four extra dimensions of
the d5-brane, which are taken to be small, so that the total system is eectively 1+1-

5there is one restriction on the nal states: for a process to be regarded as an th partial wave
absorption cross-section,  units of angular momentum must be picked up by the brane. thus oi1...i
must transform in the irreducible representation which is the th traceless symmetric power of the 6
of so(6).

dimensional. we will discuss the physics of this system more extensively in chapter 5,
and the reader can also nd background material in [58]. for now our purpose is
to show how supergravity absorption calculations relate to nite-temperature greens
functions in the 1+1-dimensional theory.

introducing momentum along the spatial world-volume (carried by open strings at-

tached to the branes), one obtains the following ten-dimensional metric and dilaton:

0 sinh2  are related to the number of d1-branes, the
the quantities r2
number of d5-branes, and the net number of units of momentum in the x5 direction,
respectively. the horizon radius, r0, is related to the non-extremality. for details, see
for example [17]. if r0 = 0 then there are only left-moving open strings on the world-
volume; if r0 6= 0 then there are both left-movers and right-movers. the hawking
temperature can be expressed as 2

(1.41)

tl and tr have the interpretation of temperatures of the left-moving and right-moving
sectors of the 1+1-dimensional world-volume theory. there is a detailed and remark-
ably successful account of the bekenstein-hawking entropy using statistical mechanics
in the world-volume theory. it was initiated in [12], developed in a number of subse-
quent papers, and has been reviewed in [58].

the region of parameter space which we will be interested in is

r0, rk  r1, r5

(1.42)

this is known as the dilute gas regime. the total energy of the open strings on the
branes is much less than the constituent mass of either the d1-branes or the d5-branes.
we are also interested in low energies r1, r5  1, but /tl,r can be arbitrary thanks
to (1.42), (1.41). the d1-d5-brane system is not stable because left-moving open
strings can run into right-moving open string and form a closed string:
indeed, this
is exactly the process we aim to quantify. since we have collisions of left and right

27

moving excitations we expect that the answer will contain the left and right moving
occupation factors, so that the emission rate is

where gef f is independent of the temperature and measures the coupling of the open
strings to the closed strings. the functional form of (1.43) seems, at rst sight, to be
dierent from (1.28). but in order to compare them we should calculate the absorption
cross section appearing in (1.28).

o-diagonal gravitons hy1y2 (with y1,2 in the compact directions) reduce to scalars
in six dimensions which obey the massless klein gordon equation. these so-called
minimal scalars have been the subject of the most detailed study. we will consider
only the s-wave and we take the momentum along the string to be zero. separation of
variables leads to the radial equation

figure 1.4: low energy dynamics of extremal or near-extremal black branes. r5 denotes
the typical gravitational size of the system, namely the position where the metric
signicantly deviates from minkowski space. the compton wavelength of the particles
we scatter is much larger than the gravitational size,   r5.
in this situation we
replace the whole black hole geometry (a) by a point-like system in the transverse
coordinates with localized excitations (b). these excitations are the ones described by
the eld theory living on the brane.

it is possible to be more precise and calculate the coecient in (1.43) and actually
check that the matching is precise [15]. we leave this to chapter 5.

both in the d3-brane analysis and in the d1-d5-brane analysis, one can see that all
the interesting physics is resulting from the near-horizon region: the far region wave-
function describes free particle propagation. for quanta whose compton wavelength is
much larger than the size of the black hole, the eect of the far region is merely to set
the boundary conditions in the near region. see gure 1.4. this provides a motivation
for the prescription for computing greens functions, to be described in section 3.3: as
the calculations of this section demonstrate, cutting out the near-horizon region of the
supergravity geometry and replacing it with the d-branes leads to an identical response
to low-energy external probes.

generalizations of poincare invariance in the hope that they may play some role in
physics; in [74] it was argued that for theories with a non-trivial s-matrix there are
no such bosonic generalizations. an interesting generalization of poincare invariance
is the addition of a scale invariance symmetry linking physics at dierent scales (this
is inconsistent with the existence of an s-matrix since it does not allow the standard
denition of asymptotic states). many interesting eld theories, like yang-mills theory
in four dimensions, are scale-invariant; generally this scale invariance does not extend
to the quantum theory (whose denition requires a cuto which explicitly breaks scale
invariance) but in some special cases (such as the d = 4,n = 4 supersymmetric yang-
mills theory) it does, and even when it does not (like in qcd) it can still be a useful
tool, leading to relations like the callan-symanzik equation. it was realized in the past
30 years that eld theories generally exhibit a renormalization group ow from some
scale-invariant (often free) uv xed point to some scale-invariant (sometimes trivial)
ir xed point, and statistical mechanics systems also often have non-trivial ir scale-
invariant xed points. thus, studying scale-invariant theories is interesting for various
physical applications.

it is widely believed that unitary interacting scale-invariant theories are always in-
variant under the full conformal group, which is a simple group including scale invari-
ance and poincare invariance. this has only been proven in complete generality for
two dimensional eld theories [75, 76], but there are no known counter-examples. in
this section we will review the conformal group and its implications for eld theories,

30

focusing on implications which will be useful in the context of the ads/cft corre-
spondence. general reviews on conformal eld theories may be found in [77, 78, 79]
and references therein.

2.1.1 the conformal group and algebra

the conformal group is the group of transformations which preserve the form of the
metric up to an arbitrary scale factor, g(x)  2(x)g(x) (in this section greek
letters will correspond to the space-time coordinates, ,  = 0,   , d  1). it is the
minimal group that includes the poincare group as well as the inversion symmetry
x  x/x2.

the conformal group of minkowski space1 is generated by the poincare transforma-

tions, the scale transformation

and the special conformal transformations

x  x,

x 

x + ax2

1 + 2xa + a2x2 .

(2.1)

(2.2)

we will denote the generators of these transformations by m for the lorentz trans-
formations, p for translations, d for the scaling transformation (2.1) and k for the
special conformal transformations (2.2). the vacuum of a conformal theory is annihi-
lated by all of these generators. they obey the conformal algebra

[m, p] = i(p  p);
[m, m] = im  permutations;
[d, p] = ip;

[m, k] = i(k  k);
[m, d] = 0;
[d, k] = ik;
[p, k] = 2im  2id,

(2.3)

with all other commutators vanishing. this algebra is isomorphic to the algebra of
so(d, 2), and can be put in the standard form of the so(d, 2) algebra (with signature
, +, +,   , +,) with generators jab (a, b = 0,   , d + 1) by dening
j = m;

j(d+1)d = d. (2.4)

jd =

j(d+1) =

(k + p);

(k  p);

for some applications it is useful to study the conformal theory in euclidean space; in
this case the conformal group is so(d + 1, 1), and since rd is conformally equivalent
to sd the eld theory on rd (with appropriate boundary conditions at innity) is
isomorphic to the theory on sd. much of what we say below will apply also to the
euclidean theory.

1more precisely, some of these transformations can take nite points in minkowski space to innity,
so they should be dened on a compactication of minkowski space which includes points at innity.

31

in the special case of d = 2 the conformal group is larger, and in fact it is innite
dimensional. the special aspects of this case will be discussed in chapter 5 where they
will be needed.

2.1.2 primary fields, correlation functions, and operator

product expansions

the interesting representations (for physical applications) of the conformal group in-
volve operators (or elds) which are eigenfunctions of the scaling operator d with
eigenvalue i ( is called the scaling dimension of the eld). this means that under
the scaling transformation (2.1) they transform as (x)  (x) = (x). the com-
mutation relations (2.3) imply that the operator p raises the dimension of the eld,
while the operator k lowers it. in unitary eld theories there is a lower bound on the
dimension of elds (for scalar elds it is   (d 2)/2 which is the dimension of a free
scalar eld), and, therefore, each representation of the conformal group which appears
must have some operator of lowest dimension, which must then be annihilated by k
(at x = 0). such operators are called primary operators. the action of the conformal
group on such operators is given by [80]

[p, (x)] = i(x),
[m, (x)] = [i(x  x) + ](x),

[d, (x)] = i( + x)(x),
[k, (x)] = [i(x2  2xx + 2x)  2x](x),

(2.5)

where  are the matrices of a nite dimensional representation of the lorentz group,
acting on the indices of the  eld. the representations of the conformal group cor-
responding to primary operators are classied by the lorentz representation and the
scaling dimension  (these determine the casimirs of the conformal group). these
representations include the primary eld and all the elds which are obtained by act-
ing on it with the generators of the conformal group (specically with p). since the
operators in these representations are eigenfunctions of d, they cannot in general be
eigenfunctions of the hamiltonian p0 or of the mass operator m 2 = p p (which is a
casimir operator of the poincare group but not of the conformal group); in fact, they
have a continuous spectrum of m 2 ranging from 0 to  (there are also representations
corresponding to free massless elds which have m 2 = 0).

another possible classication of the representations of the conformal group is in
terms of its maximal compact subgroup, which is so(d)  so(2). the generator of
so(2) is j0(d+1) = 1
2(k0 + p0), and the representations of the conformal group de-
scribed above may be decomposed into representations of this subgroup. this is useful
in particular for the oscillator constructions of the representations of superconformal

32

algebras [81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87], which we will not describe in detail here (see
[88] for a recent review). this subgroup is also useful in the radial quantization of
the conformal eld theory on sd1  r, which will be related to ads space in global
coordinates.

since the conformal group is much larger than the poincare group, it severely restricts
the correlation functions of primary elds, which must be invariant under conformal
transformations.
it has been shown by luscher and mack [89] that the euclidean
greens functions of a cft may be analytically continued to minkowski space, and
that the resulting hilbert space carries a unitary representation of the lorentzian
conformal group. the formulas we will write here for correlation functions apply both
in minkowski and in euclidean space. it is easy to show using the conformal algebra
that the 2-point functions of elds of dierent dimension vanish, while for a single
scalar eld of scaling dimension  we have

h(0)(x)i 

1

|x|2 

1

(x2) .

(2.6)

3-point functions are also determined (up to a constant) by the conformal group to be
of the form

cijk

. (2.7)

|x1  x2|1+23|x1  x3|1+32|x2  x3|2+31

hi(x1)j(x2)k(x3)i =
similar expressions (possibly depending on additional constants) arise for non-scalar
elds. with 4 independent xi one can construct two combinations of the xi (known as
harmonic ratios) which are conformally invariant, so the correlation function can be any
function of these combinations; for higher n-point functions there are more and more
independent functions which can appear in the correlation functions. many other prop-
erties of conformal eld theories are also easily determined using the conformal invari-
ance; for instance, their equation of state is necessarily of the form s = cv (e/v )(d1)/d
for some constant c.

the eld algebra of any conformal eld theory includes the energy-momentum tensor
t which is an operator of dimension  = d; the ward identities of the conformal al-
gebra relate correlation functions with t to correlation functions without t . similarly,
whenever there are global symmetries, their (conserved) currents j are necessarily
operators of dimension  = d  1. the scaling dimensions of other operators are not
determined by the conformal group, and generally they receive quantum corrections.
for any type of eld there is, however, a lower bound on its dimension which follows
from unitarity; as mentioned above, for scalar elds the bound is   (d 2)/2, where
equality can occur only for free scalar elds.

a general property of local eld theories is the existence of an operator product
expansion (ope). as we bring two operators o1(x) and o2(y) to the same point, their

33

product creates a general local disturbance at that point, which may be expressed as
a sum of local operators acting at that point; in general all operators with the same
global quantum numbers as o1o2 may appear. the general expression for the ope
is o1(x)o2(y) pn c n
12(x  y)on(y), where this expression should be understood as
appearing inside correlation functions, and the coecient functions c n
12 do not depend
on the other operators in the correlation function (the expression is useful when the
distance to all other operators is much larger than |x  y|). in a conformal theory, the
functional form of the ope coecients is determined by conformal invariance to be
c n
12(x  y) = cn
12 are related to the 3-point
functions described above. the leading terms in the ope of the energy-momentum
tensor with primary elds are determined by the conformal algebra. for instance, for
a scalar primary eld  of dimension  in four dimensions,

12/|x  y|1+2n, where the constants cn

t(x)(0)  (0)(

1
x2 ) +    .

(2.8)

one of the basic properties of conformal eld theories is the one-to-one correspon-
dence between local operators o and states |oi in the radial quantization of the theory.
in radial quantization the time coordinate is chosen to be the radial direction in rd,
with the origin corresponding to past innity, so that the eld theory lives on rsd1.
the hamiltonian in this quantization is the operator j0(d+1) mentioned above. an op-
erator o can then be mapped to the state |oi = limx0 o(x)|0i. equivalently, the
state may be viewed as a functional of eld values on some ball around the origin, and
then the state corresponding to o is dened by a functional integral on a ball around
the origin with the insertion of the operator o at the origin. the inverse mapping of
states to operators proceeds by taking a state which is a functional of eld values on
some ball around the origin and using conformal invariance to shrink the ball to zero
size, in which case the insertion of the state is necessarily equivalent to the insertion
of some local operator.

2.1.3 superconformal algebras and field theories

another interesting generalization of the poincare algebra is the supersymmetry alge-
bra, which includes additional fermionic operators q which anti-commute to the trans-
lation operators p. it is interesting to ask whether supersymmetry and the conformal
group can be joined together to form the largest possible simple algebra including the
poincare group; it turns out that in some dimensions and for some numbers of su-
persymmetry charges this is indeed possible. the full classication of superconformal
algebras was given by nahm [90]; it turns out that superconformal algebras exist only
for d  6. in addition to the generators of the conformal group and the supersymme-
try, superconformal algebras include two other types of generators. there are fermionic

34

generators s (one for each supersymmetry generator) which arise in the commutator
of k with q, and there are (sometimes) r-symmetry generators forming some lie
algebra, which appear in the anti-commutator of q and s (the generators q and s are
in the fundamental representation of this lie algebra). schematically (suppressing all
indices), the commutation relations of the superconformal algebra include, in addition
to (2.3), the relations

i
[d, q] = 
2
{q, q}  p ;

q;

[d, s] =
{s, s}  k;

i
2

s;

[k, q]  s;

[p, s]  q;

(2.9)

{q, s}  m + d + r.

the exact form of the commutation relations is dierent for dierent dimensions (since
the spinorial representations of the conformal group behave dierently) and for dierent
r-symmetry groups, and we will not write them explicitly here.

for free eld theories without gravity, which do not include elds whose spin is
bigger than one, the maximal possible number of supercharges is 16 (a review of eld
theories with this number of supercharges appears in [91]); it is believed that this is the
maximal possible number of supercharges also in interacting eld theories. therefore,
the maximal possible number of fermionic generators in a eld theory superconformal
algebra is 32. superconformal eld theories with this number of supercharges exist
only for d = 3, 4, 6 (d = 1 may also be possible but there are no known examples). for
d = 3 the r-symmetry group is spin(8) and the fermionic generators are in the (4, 8)
of so(3, 2)  spin(8); for d = 4 the r-symmetry group is su(4) and2 the fermionic
generators are in the (4, 4) + (4, 4) of so(4, 2) su(4); and for d = 6 the r-symmetry
group is sp(2)  so(5) and the fermionic generators are in the (8, 4) representation
of so(6, 2)  sp(2).

since the conformal algebra is a subalgebra of the superconformal algebra, represen-
tations of the superconformal algebra split into several representations of the conformal
algebra. generally a primary eld of the superconformal algebra, which is (by deni-
tion) annihilated (at x = 0) by the generators k and s, will include several primaries
of the conformal algebra, which arise by acting with the supercharges q on the su-
perconformal primary eld. the superconformal algebras have special representations
corresponding to chiral primary operators, which are primary operators which are an-
nihilated by some combination of the supercharges. these representations are smaller
than the generic representations, containing less conformal-primary elds. a special
property of chiral primary operators is that their dimension is uniquely determined by
their r-symmetry representations and cannot receive any quantum corrections. this
follows by using the fact that all the s generators and some of the q generators anni-
hilate the eld, and using the {q, s} commutation relation to compute the eigenvalue
2note that this is dierent from the other n -extended superconformal algebras in four dimensions

which have a u (n ) r-symmetry.

35

of d in terms of the lorentz and r-symmetry representations [92, 93, 94, 91, 95]. the
dimensions of non-chiral primary elds of the same representation are always strictly
larger than those of the chiral primary elds. a simple example is the d = 4,n = 1
superconformal algebra (which has a u(1) r-symmetry group); in this case a chiral
multiplet (annihilated by q) which is a primary is also a chiral primary, and the algebra
can be used to prove that the dimension of the scalar component of such multiplets
is  = 3
2 r where r is the u(1) r-charge. a detailed description of the structure of
chiral primaries in the d = 4,n = 4 algebra will appear in section 3.2.

when the r-symmetry group is abelian, we nd a bound of the form   a|r|
for some constant a, ensuring that there is no singularity in the ope of two chiral
( = ar) or anti-chiral ( = a|r| = ar) operators. on the other hand, when
the r-symmetry group is non-abelian, singularities can occur in the opes of chiral
operators, and are avoided only when the product lies in particular representations.

2.2 anti-de sitter space

2.2.1 geometry of anti-de sitter space

in this section, we will review some geometric facts about anti-de sitter space. one
of the important facts is the relation between the conformal compactications of ads
and of at space.
in the case of the euclidean signature metric, it is well-known
that the at space rn can be compactied to the n-sphere sn by adding a point at
innity, and a conformal eld theory is naturally dened on sn. on the other hand,
the (n + 1)-dimensional hyperbolic space, which is the euclidean version of ads space,
can be conformally mapped into the (n + 1)-dimensional disk dn+1. therefore the
boundary of the compactied hyperbolic space is the compactied euclid space. a
similar correspondence holds in the case with the lorentzian signature metric, as we
will see below.

conformal structure of flat space

one of the basic features of the ads/cft correspondence is the identication of the
isometry group of adsp+2 with the conformal symmetry of at minkowski space r1,p.
therefore, it would be appropriate to start our discussion by reviewing the conformal
structure of at space.

 r1,1

we begin with two-dimensional minkowski space r1,1:

ds2 = dt2 + dx2,

( < t, x < +).

(2.10)

36

this metric can be rewritten by the following coordinate transformations

ds2 = du+du ,
1

(u = t  x)
(d 2 + d2) ,

=

4 cos2 u+ cos2 u

(u = tan u; u = (  )/2).(2.11)
in this way, the minkowski space is conformally mapped into the interior of the com-
pact region, |u| < /2, as shown in gure 2.1. since light ray trajectories are invariant
under a conformal rescaling of the metric, this provides a convenient way to express
the causal structure of r1,1. the new coordinates (, ) are well dened at the asymp-
totical regions of the at space. therefore, the conformal compactication is used to
give a rigorous denition of asymptotic atness of spacetime  a spacetime is called
asymptotically at if it has the same boundary structure as that of the at space after
conformal compactication.

figure 2.1: two-dimensional minkowski space is conformally mapped into the interior
of the rectangle.

the two corners of the rectangle at (, ) = (0,) correspond to the spatial innities
x =  in the original coordinates. by identifying these two points, we can embed
the rectangular image of r1,1 in a cylinder r s1 as shown in gure 2.2. it was proven
by luscher and mack [89] that correlation functions of a conformal eld theory (cft)
on r1,1 can be analytically continued to the entire cylinder.

as we saw in section 2.1, the global conformal symmetry of r1,1 is so(2, 2), which

to j03 and j12, and generate the maximally compact subgroup so(2)  so(2) of
so(2, 2).

 r1,p with p  2

it is straightforward to extend the above analysis to higher dimensional minkowski

space:

(2.13)
where dp1 is the line element on the unit sphere sp1. a series of coordinate changes
transforms this as

ds2 = dt2 + dr2 + r2d2

into a triangular region in the (, ) plane. the conformally scaled metric

to the north and south poles of sp. this is a natural generalization of the conformal
embedding of r1,1 into r  s1 that we saw in the p = 1 case.

on r1,p dened in section 2.1. the generator h = j0,p+2 corresponds to the so(2)

the subgroup so(2) so(p + 1) (or to be precise its universal cover) of the conformal
group so(2, p + 1) can be identied with the isometry of the einstein static universe
r  sp. the existence of the generator h also guarantees that a correlation function
of a cft on r1,p can be analytically extended to the entire einstein static universe
r  sp.

figure 2.4: adsp+2 is realized as a hyperboloid in r2,p+1. the hyperboloid has closed
timelike curves along the  direction. to obtain a causal space, we need to unwrap the
circle to obtain a simply connected space.

anti-de sitter space

the (p + 2)-dimensional anti-de sitter space (adsp+2) can be represented as the hy-
perboloid

(2.20)

(2.21)

by construction, the space has the isometry so(2, p + 1), and it is homogeneous and
isotropic.

equation (2.20) can be solved by setting

x0 = r cosh  cos ,
xi = r sinh  i

xp+2 = r cosh  sin ,
i = 1).

(i = 1,   , p + 1;xi

substituting this into (2.21), we obtain the metric on adsp+2 as
ds2 = r2( cosh2  d 2 + d2 + sinh2  d2).

(2.22)

(2.23)

by taking 0   and 0   < 2 the solution (2.22) covers the entire hyperboloid once.
therefore, (, , i) are called the global coordinates of ads. since the metric behaves
near  = 0 as ds2  r2(d 2 + d2 + 2 d2), the hyperboloid has the topology of
s1  rp+1, with s1 representing closed timelike curves in the  direction. to obtain a

40

causal spacetime, we can simply unwrap the circle s1 (i.e. take  <  <  with
no identications) and obtain the universal covering of the hyperboloid without closed
timelike curves. in this paper, when we refer to adsp+2, we only consider this universal
covering space.

the isometry group so(2, p + 1) of adsp+2 has the maximal compact subgroup
so(2)  so(p + 1). from the above construction, it is clear that the so(2) part
represents the constant translation in the  direction, and the so(p+1) gives rotations
of sp.

to study the causal structure of adsp+2, it is convenient to introduce a coordinate
 related to  by tan  = sinh  (0   < /2). the metric (2.23) then takes the form

ds2 =

r2

cos2 

(d 2 + d2 + sin2  d2).

(2.24)

the causal structure of the spacetime does not change by a conformal rescaling on the
metric. multiplying the metric by r2 cos2 , it becomes

ds2 = d 2 + d2 + sin2  d2.

(2.25)

this is the metric of the einstein static universe, which also appeared, with the dimen-
sion lower by one, in the conformal compactication of r1,p (2.15). this time, however,
the coordinate  takes values in 0   < /2, rather than 0   <  in (2.15). namely,
adsp+2 can be conformally mapped into one half of the einstein static universe; the

41

spacelike hypersurface of constant  is a (p + 1)-dimensional hemisphere. the equator
at  = /2 is a boundary of the space with the topology of sp, as shown in gure 2.5
in the case of p = 1. (in the case of ads2, the coordinate  ranges /2    /2
since s0 consists of two points.) as in the case of the at space discussed earlier, the
conformal compactication is a convenient way to describe the asymptotic regions of
ads. in general, if a spacetime can be conformally compactied into a region which has
the same boundary structure as one half of the einstein static universe, the spacetime
is called asymptotically ads.

since the boundary extends in the timelike direction labeled by  , we need to specify
a boundary condition on the r  sp at  = /2 in order to make the cauchy problem
well-posed on ads [96]. it turns out that the boundary of adsp+2, or to be precise the
boundary of the conformally compactied adsp+2, is identical to the conformal com-
pactication of the (p + 1)-dimensional minkowski space. this fact plays an essential
role in the adsp+2/cftp+1 correspondence.

figure 2.6: ads2 can be conformally mapped into r  [/2, /2]. the (u, t) coordi-
nates cover the triangular region.

in addition to the global parametrization (2.22) of ads, there is another set of

coordinates (u, t, ~x) (0 < u, ~x  rp) which will be useful later. it is dened by

x0 =

these coordinates cover one half of the hyperboloid (2.20), as shown in gure 2.6 in
the case of p = 0. substituting this into (2.21), we obtain another form of the adsp+2
metric

ds2 = r2  du2

u2 + u2(dt2 + d~x 2)! .

(2.27)

the coordinates (u, t, ~x) are called the poincare coordinates. in this form of the metric,
the subgroup iso(1, p)  so(1, 1) of the so(2, p + 1) isometry is manifest, where
iso(1, p) is the poincare transformation on (t, ~x) and so(1, 1) is

(t, ~x, u)  (ct, c~x, c1u),

c > 0.

figure 2.7: the timelike killing vector t is depicted in the ads2 case. the vector t
becomes a null vector at u = 0.

it is useful to compare the two expressions, (2.23) and (2.27), for the metric of
adsp+2. in (2.23), the norm of the timelike killing vector  is everywhere non-zero.
in particular, it has a constant norm in the conformally rescaled metric (2.24). for this
reason,  is called the global time coordinate of ads. on the other hand, the timelike
killing vector t in (2.27) becomes null at u = 0 (killing horizon), as depicted in gure
2.7 in the ads2 case.

euclidean rotation

since adsp+2 has the global time coordinate  and the metric (2.23) is static with
respect to  , quantum eld theory on adsp+2 (with an appropriate boundary condition
at spatial innity) allows the wick rotation in  , ei h  ee h. from (2.22), one
nds that the wick rotation   e = i is expressed in the original coordinates
(x0, ~x, xp+2) on the hyperboloid as xp+2  xe = ixp+2, and the space becomes

0  x 2
x 2
ds2
e = dx 2

e  ~x 2 = r2,
0 + dx 2

e + d ~x 2.

(2.29)

we should point out that the same space is obtained by rotating the time coordinate
t of the poincare coordinates (2.26) as t  te = it, even though the poincare
coordinates cover only a part of the entire ads (half of the hyperboloid). this is
analogous to the well-known fact in at minkowski space that the euclidean rotation of
the time coordinate t in the rindler space ds2 = r2dt2 + dr2 gives the at euclidean
plane r2, even though the rindler coordinates (t, r) cover only a 1/4 of the entire
minkowski space r1,1.

in the coordinates (, e, ~p) and (u, te, ~x), the euclidean metric is expressed as

ds2

e = r2(cid:16)cosh2  d 2
= r2  du2
u2 + u2(dt2

e + d2 + sinh2  d2

e + d~x2)! .

p(cid:17)

(2.30)

in the following, we also use another, trivially equivalent, form of the metric, obtained
from the above by setting u = 1/y in (2.30), giving

ds2 = r2 dy2 + dx2

1 +    dx2

(2.31)

the euclidean adsp+2 is useful for various practical computations in eld theory.
for theories on at space, it is well-known that correlation functions h1    ni of elds
on the euclidean space are related, by the wick rotation, to the t -ordered correlation
functions h0|t (1    n)|0i in the minkowski space. the same is true in the anti-de
sitter space if the theory has a positive denite hamiltonian with respect to the global
time coordinate  . green functions of free elds on adsp+2 have been computed in
[97, 98] using this method.

the euclidean adsp+2 can be mapped into a (p + 2)-dimensional disk. in the coordi-
nates (u, te, ~x), u =  is the sphere sp+1 at the boundary with one point removed. the
full boundary sphere is recovered by adding a point corresponding to u = 0 (or equiv-
alently ~x = ). this is shown in gure 2.8 in the case of ads2, for which z = te + i/u

figure 2.8: the euclidean ads2 is the upper half plane with the poincare metric. it
can be mapped into a disk, where the innity of the upper half plane is mapped to a
point on the boundary of the disk.

gives a complex coordinate on the upper-half plane. by adding a point at innity, the
upper-half plane is compactied into a disk. in the lorentzian case, u = 0 represented
the killing horizon giving the boundary of the (u, t, ~x) coordinates. since the u = 0
plane is null in the lorentzian case, it shrinks to a point in the euclidean case.

2.2.2 particles and fields in anti-de sitter space

massive particles, moving along geodesics, can never get to the boundary of ads. on
the other hand, since the penrose diagram of ads is a cylinder, light rays can go to the
boundary and back in nite time, as observed by an observer moving along a geodesic
in ads. more precisely, the light ray will reect if suitable boundary conditions are set
for the elds propagating in ads.

let us rst consider the case of a scalar eld propagating in adsp+2. the eld

equation

has stationary wave solutions

(cid:16)  m2(cid:17)  = 0

 = ei g()yl(p),

(2.32)

(2.33)

where yl(p) is a spherical harmonic, which is an eigenstate of the laplacian on sp
with an eigenvalue l(l + p  1), and g() is given by the hypergeometric function

g() = (sin )l(cos )

(2.37)

is conserved for any constant value of . the value of  is determined by the coupling
of the scalar curvature to 2, which on ads has the same eect as the mass term in
the wave equation (2.32). the choice of  for each scalar eld depends on the theory
we are considering. the total energy e of the scalar eld uctuation,

e =z dp+1xgt 0

0 ,

(2.38)

is conserved only if the energy-momentum ux through the boundary at  = /2
vanishes,

this requirement reduces to the boundary condition

(tan )p [(1  2) + 2 tan ] 2  0 (  /2).

going back to the stationary wave solution (2.34), this is satised if and only if either
a or b in (2.34) is an integer. if we require the energy  to be real, we nd

||r =  + l + 2n,

(n = 0, 1, 2,  ).

(2.41)

this is possible only when  dened by (2.36) is real. consequently, the mass is
bounded from below as

1
4



(p + 1)2  m2r2.

(2.42)

this is known as the breitenlohner-freedman bound [99, 100]. note that a negative
(mass)2 is allowed to a certain extent. the compton wavelength for these possible
tachyons is comparable to the curvature radius of ads. if m2 > p(p + 2)/4r2 we
should choose + in (2.41), since this solution is normalizable while the solution with 

46

is not. if m2  p(p + 2)/4r2 more care is necessary to choose the physical solutions
[100, 101, 102], since both solutions are normalizable, but still only one solution is
physical for each eld on ads. in general, all solutions to the wave equation form a
single so(2, p+1) highest weight representation. the highest weight state is the lowest
energy solution [103]. since so(2, p + 1) acts on ads as isometries, the action of its
generators on the solutions is given by rst order dierential operators.

2.2.3 supersymmetry in anti-de sitter space

the so(2, p + 1) isometry group of adsp+2 has a supersymmetric generalization called
an ads supergroup. to understand the supersymmetry on ads, it would be useful to
start with the simple supergravity with a cosmological constant . in four dimensions,
for example, the action of the n = 1 theory is [104]

s =z d4x(cid:18)g(r  2) +

where

d = d +

i

1
2

 5 d(cid:19) ,
2s 



3

(2.43)

(2.44)

(2.46)

and d is the standard covariant derivative. the local supersymmetry transformation
rules for the vierbein va and the gravitino  are

va = i(x)a,
 = d(x).

(2.45)

a global supersymmetry of a given supergravity background is determined by re-
quiring that the gravitino variation is annihilated,  = 0. the resulting condition
on (x),

d =d +

i

2s 

3

  = 0,

is known as the killing spinor equation. the integrability of this equation requires

[ d, d] =

1
2

(r 

2
3

) = 0,

where

 =

1
2

[,].

since ads is maximally symmetric, the curvature obeys

r =

1
r2 (gg  gg) ,

47

(2.47)

(2.48)

(2.49)

where r is the size of the hyperboloid dened by (2.20). thus, if we choose the
curvature of ads to be  = 3/r2 (this is necessary for ads to be a classical solution of
(2.43)), the integrability condition (2.47) is obeyed for any spinor . since the killing
spinor equation (2.46) is a rst order equation, this means that there are as many
solutions to the equation as the number of independent components of the spinor.
namely, ads preserves as many supersymmetries as at space.

the existence of supersymmetry implies that, with an appropriate set of boundary
conditions, the supergravity theory on ads is stable with its energy bounded from
below. the supergravity theories on ads typically contains scalar elds with negative
(mass)2. however they all satisfy the bound (2.42) [102, 105]. the issue of the boundary
condition and supersymmetry in ads was further studied in [101]. a non-perturbative
proof of the stability of ads is given in [106], based on a generalization of wittens
proof [107] of the positive energy theorem in at space [108].

2.2.4 gauged supergravities and kaluza-klein compactica-

tions

extended supersymmetries in adsp+2 with p = 2, 3, 4, 5 are classied by nahm [90]
(see also [109]) as

ads4
ads5
ads6
ads7

: osp(n|4), n = 1, 2,  
:

su(2, 2|n /2), n = 2, 4, 6, 8
f (4)

:
: osp(6, 2|n ), n = 2, 4.

(2.50)

for adsp+2 with p > 5, there is no simple ads supergroup. these extended super-
symmetries are realized as global symmetries of gauged supergravity on adsp+2. the
ads/cft correspondence identies them with the superconformal algebras discussed
in section 2.1.3. gauged supergravities are supergravity theories with non-abelian
gauge elds in the supermultiplet of the graviton. typically the cosmological constant
is negative and adsp+2 is a natural background geometry. many of them are related
to kaluza-klein compactication of the supergravities in 10 and 11 dimensions. a
complete catalogue of gauged supergravities in dimensions  11 is found in [20]. here
we list some of them.

 ads7

the gauged supergravity in 7 dimensions has global supersymmetry osp(6, 2|n ).
the maximally supersymmetric case of n = 4 constructed in [110] contains a yang-
mills eld with a gauge group sp(2)  so(5). the eld content of this theory can be

48

derived from a truncation of the spectrum of the kaluza-klein compactication of the
11-dimensional supergravity to 7 dimensions,

r11  ads7  s4.
the 11-dimensional supergravity has the lagrangian

ff (cid:19) +

72

a  f  f + fermions,

(2.52)

where a is a 3-form gauge eld and f = da. it was pointed out by freund and rubin
[111] that there is a natural way to compactify the theory to 4 or 7 dimensions. we
have put the word compactify in quotes since we will see that typically the size of
the compact dimensions is comparable to the radius of curvature of the non-compact
dimensions. to compactify the theory to 7 dimensions, the ansatz of freund and
rubin sets the 4-form eld strength f to be proportional to the volume element on a
4-dimensional subspace m4. the einstein equation, which includes the contribution of
f to the energy-momentum tensor, implies a positive curvature on m4 and a constant
negative curvature on the non-compact dimensions, i.e. they are ads7.

the maximally symmetric case is obtained by considering m4 = s4. since there is
no cosmological constant in 11 dimensions, the radius r of s4 is proportional to the
curvature radius of ads7. by the kaluza-klein mechanism, the so(5) isometry of s4
becomes the gauge symmetry in 7 dimensions. the spherical harmonics on s4 give
an innite tower of kaluza-klein particles on ads7. a truncation of this spectrum
to include only the graviton supermultiplet gives the spectrum of the n = 4 so(5)
gauged supergravity on ads7. it has been believed that this is a consistent truncation
of the full theory, and very recently it was shown in [112] that this is indeed the case.
in general, there are subtleties in the consistent truncation procedure, which will be
discussed in more detail in the next subsection. there are also other n = 4 theories
with non-compact gauge groups so(p, q) with p + q = 5 [113].

the seven dimensional n = 2 gauged supergravity with gauge group sp(1)  su(2)
was constructed in [114]. in this case, one can have also a matter theory with possibly
another gauge group g.
it is not known whether a matter theory of arbitrary g
with arbitrary coupling constant can be coupled to gauged supergravity. the kaluza-
klein compactication of 10-dimensional n = 1 supergravity, coupled to n = 1 super
yang-mills, on s3 gives a particular example. in this case, ten dimensional anomaly
cancellation requires particular choices of g.

 ads6

the 6-dimensional anti-de sitter supergroup f (4) is realized by the n = 4 gauged
supergravity with gauge group su(2). it was predicted to exist in [115] and constructed
in [116].
it was conjectured in [117] to be related to a compactication of the ten

49

dimensional massive type iia supergravity theory. the relevant compactication of
the massive type iia supergravity is constructed as a bration of ads6 over s4 [118].
the form of the ten dimensional space is called a warped product [119] and it is the
most general one that has the ads isometry group [120]. the su(2) gauge group of
the 6-dimensional n = 4 gauged supergravity is associated with an su(2) subgroup
of the so(4) isometry group of the compact part of the ten dimensional space.

 ads5

in 5 dimensions, there are n = 2, 4, 6 and 8 gauged supergravities with supersym-
metry su(2, 2|n /2). the gauged n = 8 supergravity was constructed in [121, 122]. it
has the gauge group su(4)  so(6) and the global symmetry e6. this theory can be
derived by a truncation of the compactication of 10-dimensional type iib supergravity
on s5 using the freund-rubin ansatz, i.e. setting the self-dual 5-form eld strength
f (5) to be proportional to the volume form of s5 [123, 83, 124]. by the einstein equa-
tion, the strength of f (5) determines the radius of s5 and the cosmological constant
r2 of ads5.

this case is of particular interest; as we will see below, the ads/cft correspondence
claims that it is dual to the large n (and large g2
y m n) limit of n = 4 supersymmetric
su(n) gauge theory in four dimensions. the complete kaluza-klein mass spectrum
of the iib supergravity theory on ads5  s5 was obtained in [83, 124]. one of the
interesting features of the kaluza-klein spectrum (in this case as well as in the other
cases discussed in this section) is that the frequency  of stationary wave solutions is
quantized. for example, the masses of the scalar elds in the kaluza-klein tower are
all of the form (mr)2 = l(l+4), where l is an integer bounded from below. substituting
this into (2.36) with p = 3, we obtain

 = 2  |l + 2|.

(2.53)

therefore, the frequency  given by (2.41) takes values in integer multiples of 1/r:

||r = 2  |l + 2| + l + 2n,

(n = 0, 1, 2,  ).

(2.54)

this means that all the scalar elds in the supergravity multiplet are periodic in 
with the period 2, i.e. the scalar elds are single-valued on the original hyperboloid
(2.20) before taking the universal covering. this applies to all other elds in the
supermultiplet as well, with the fermions obeying the ramond boundary condition
around the timelike circle.

the fact that the frequency  is quantized has its origin in supersymmetry. the
supergravity particles in 10 dimensions are bps objects and preserve one half of the
supersymmetry. this property is preserved under the kaluza-klein compactication
on s5. the notion of the bps particles in the case of ads supergravity is claried in

50

[125] and it is shown, in the context of theories in 4 dimensions, that it leads to the
quantization of . in the ads/cft correspondence, this is dual to the fact that chiral
primary operators do not have anomalous dimensions.

on the other hand, energy levels of other states, such as stringy states or black holes,
are not expected to be quantized as the supergravity modes are. thus, the full string
theory does not make sense on the hyperboloid but only on its universal cover without
the closed timelike curve.

the n = 4 gauged supergravity with gauge group su(2)  u(1) was constructed in

[126]. various n = 2 theories were constructed in [127, 128, 129, 130].
 ads4

in four dimensions, some of the possible ads supergroups are osp(n|4) with n =
1, 2, 4 and 8. n = 8 is the maximal supergroup that corresponds to a supergravity
theory. the n = 8 gauged supergravity with so(8) gauge group was constructed in
[131, 132]. this theory (like the other theories discussed in this section) has a highly
non-trivial potential for scalar elds, whose extrema were analyzed in [133, 134]. it
was shown in [135] that the extremum with n = 8 supersymmetry corresponds to
a truncation of the compactication of 11-dimensional supergravity on ads4  s7.
some of the other extrema can also be identied with truncations of compactications
of the 11-dimensional theory. for a review of the 4-dimensional compactications of
11-dimensional supergravity, see [21].

 ads3

nahms classication does not include this case since the isometry group so(2, 2) of
ads3 is not a simple group but rather the direct product of two sl(2, r) factors. the
supergravity theories associated with the ads3 supergroups osp(p|2) osp(q|2) were
constructed in [136] and studied more recently in [137]. they can be regarded as the
chern-simons gauge theories of gauge group osp(p|2)  osp(q|2). therefore, they
are topological eld theories without local degrees of freedom. the case of p = q = 3
is obtained, for example, by a truncation of the kaluza-klein compactication of the
6-dimensional n = (2, 0) supergravity on s3. in addition to osp(p|2), several other
supersymmetric extensions of sl(2, r) are known, such as:

su(n|1, 1), g(3), f (4), d(2, 1, ).

(2.55)

their representations are studied extensively in the context of two-dimensional super-
conformal eld theories.

51

2.2.5 consistent truncation of kaluza-klein compactications

despite the fact that the equations of motion for type iib supergravity in ten dimen-
sions are known, it turns out to be dicult to extract any simple form for the equations
of motion of uctuations around its ve-dimensional kaluza-klein compactication on
s5. the spectrum of this compactication is known from the work of [124, 83]. it is
a general feature of compactications involving anti-de sitter space that the positively
curved compact part has a radius of curvature on the same order as the negatively
curved anti-de sitter part. as a result, the positive (mass)2 of kaluza-klein modes is
of the same order as the negative (mass)2 of tachyonic modes. thus there is no low-
energy limit in which one can argue that all but nitely many kaluza-klein harmonics
decouple. this was a traditional worry for all compactications of eleven-dimensional
supergravity on squashed seven-spheres.

however, fairly compelling evidence exists ([138] and references therein) that the
reduction of eleven-dimensional supergravity on s7 can be consistently truncated to
four-dimensional n = 8 gauged supergravity. this is an exact statement about the
equations of motion, and does not rely in any way on taking a low-energy limit. put
simply, it means that any solution of the truncated theory can be lifted to a solution of
the untruncated theory. charged black hole metrics in anti-de sitter space provide a
non-trivial example of solutions that can be lifted to the higher-dimensional theory [139,
140, 141]. there is a belief but no proof that a similar truncation may be made from ten-
dimensional type iib supergravity on s5 to ve-dimensional n = 8 supergravity. to
illustrate how radical a truncation this is, we indicate in gure 2.9 the ve-dimensional
scalars that are kept (this is a part of one of the gures in [124]). note that not
all of them are so(6) singlets.
indeed, the elds which are kept are precisely the
superpartners of the massless graviton under the supergroup su(2, 2|4), which includes
so(6) as its r-symmetry group.

the historical route to gauged supergravities was as an elaboration of the ungauged
theories, and only after the fact were they argued to be related to the kaluza-klein
reduction of higher dimensional theories on positively curved manifolds. in ungauged
d = 5 n = 8 supergravity, the scalars parametrize the coset e6(6)/usp(8) (following
[142] we use here usp(8) to denote the unitary version of the symplectic group with a
four-dimensional cartan subalgebra). the spectrum of gauged supergravity is almost
the same: the only dierence is that twelve of the vector elds are dualized into anti-

lower-case roman indices are the eight-valued indices of the fundamental of usp(8).
multiple usp(8) indices in (2.56) are antisymmetrized and the symplectic trace parts
removed. the upper-case roman indices i, j are the six-valued indices of the vector
representation of so(6), while the index  indicates a doublet of the sl(2, r) which
descends directly from the sl(2, r) global symmetry of type iib supergravity. these
groups are embedded into e6(6) via the chain

e6(6)  sl(6, r)  sl(2, r)  so(6)  sl(2, r) .

(2.57)

the key step in formulating gauged supergravities is to introduce minimal gauge
couplings into the lagrangian for all elds which are charged under the subgroup of
the global symmetry group that is to be gauged. for instance, if xi is a scalar eld in
the vector representation of so(6), one makes the replacement

xi  dxi = xi  ga ij x j

(2.58)

everywhere in the ungauged action. the gauge coupling g has dimensions of energy
in ve dimensions, and one can eventually show that g = 2/r where r is the radius

53

of the s5 in the ads5  s5 geometry. the replacement (2.58) spoils supersymmetry,
but it was shown in [122, 121] that a supersymmetric lagrangian can be recovered
by adding terms at o(g) and o(g2). the full lagrangian and the supersymmetry
transformations can be found in these references. it is a highly non-trivial claim that
this action, with its beautiful non-polynomial structure in the scalar elds, represents
a consistent truncation of the reduction of type iib supergravity on s5. this is not
entirely implausible, in view of the fact that the so(6) isometry of the s5 becomes
the local gauge symmetry of the truncated theory. trivial examples of consistent
truncation include situations where one restricts to elds which are invariant under
some subgroup of the gauge group. for instance, the part of n = 8 ve-dimensional
supergravity invariant under a particular su(2)  so(6) is n = 4 gauged supergravity
coupled to two tensor multiplets [143].

the o(g2) term in the lagrangian is particularly interesting:

it is a potential v
for the scalars. v is an so(6)  sl(2, r) invariant function on the coset manifold
e6(6)/usp(8). it involves all the 42 scalars except the dilaton and the axion. roughly
speaking, one can think of the 40 remaining scalars as parametrizing a restricted class
of deformations of the metric and 3-form elds on the s5, and of v as measuring the
response of type iib supergravity to these deformations. if the scalars are frozen to an
extremum of v , then the value of the potential sets the cosmological constant in ve
dimensions. the associated conformal eld theories were discussed in [144, 145, 146].
the known extrema can be classied by the subset of the so(6) global r-symmetry
group that is preserved.

ads/cft correspondence

3.1 the correspondence

in this section we will present an argument connecting type iib string theory compact-
ied on ads5  s5 to n = 4 super-yang-mills theory [5]. let us start with type iib
string theory in at, ten dimensional minkowski space. consider n parallel d3 branes
that are sitting together or very close to each other (the precise meaning of very close
will be dened below). the d3 branes are extended along a (3 + 1) dimensional plane
in (9 + 1) dimensional spacetime. string theory on this background contains two kinds
of perturbative excitations, closed strings and open strings. the closed strings are the
excitations of empty space and the open strings end on the d-branes and describe exci-
tations of the d-branes. if we consider the system at low energies, energies lower than
the string scale 1/ls, then only the massless string states can be excited, and we can
write an eective lagrangian describing their interactions. the closed string massless
states give a gravity supermultiplet in ten dimensions, and their low-energy eective
lagrangian is that of type iib supergravity. the open string massless states give an
n = 4 vector supermultiplet in (3 + 1) dimensions, and their low-energy eective
lagrangian is that of n = 4 u(n) super-yang-mills theory [61, 2].

the complete eective action of the massless modes will have the form

s = sbulk + sbrane + sint.

(3.1)

sbulk is the action of ten dimensional supergravity, plus some higher derivative cor-
rections. note that the lagrangian (3.1) involves only the massless elds but it takes
into account the eects of integrating out the massive elds. it is not renormalizable
(even for the elds on the brane), and it should only be understood as an eective
description in the wilsonian sense, i.e. we integrate out all massive degrees of freedom
but we do not integrate out the massless ones. the brane action sbrane is dened on
the (3 + 1) dimensional brane worldvolume, and it contains the n = 4 super-yang-

55

sbulk

22 z gr z (h)2 + (h)2h +    ,

(3.2)

mills lagrangian plus some higher derivative corrections, for example terms of the
form 2tr(f 4). finally, sint describes the interactions between the brane modes and
the bulk modes. the leading terms in this interaction lagrangian can be obtained by
covariantizing the brane action, introducing the background metric for the brane [147].
we can expand the bulk action as a free quadratic part describing the propagation
of free massless modes (including the graviton), plus some interactions which are pro-
portional to positive powers of the square root of the newton constant. schematically
we have

where we have written the metric as g =  + h. we indicate explicitly the dependence
on the graviton, but the other terms in the lagrangian, involving other elds, can be
expanded in a similar way. similarly, the interaction lagrangian sint is proportional to
positive powers of . if we take the low energy limit, all interaction terms proportional
to  drop out. this is the well known fact that gravity becomes free at long distances
(low energies).

in order to see more clearly what happens in this low energy limit it is convenient
to keep the energy xed and send ls  0 (  0) keeping all the dimensionless
in this limit the
parameters xed, including the string coupling constant and n.
coupling   gs2  0, so that the interaction lagrangian relating the bulk and the
brane vanishes. in addition all the higher derivative terms in the brane action vanish,
leaving just the pure n = 4 u(n) gauge theory in 3 + 1 dimensions, which is known
to be a conformal eld theory. and, the supergravity theory in the bulk becomes free.
so, in this low energy limit we have two decoupled systems. on the one hand we have
free gravity in the bulk and on the other hand we have the four dimensional gauge
theory.

next, we consider the same system from a dierent point of view. d-branes are
massive charged objects which act as a source for the various supergravity elds. as
shown in section 1.3 we can nd a d3 brane solution [55] of supergravity, of the form

2 + dx2

3) + f 1/2(dr2 + r2d2

5) ,

ds2 = f1/2(dt2 + dx2
1 + dx2
f5 = (1 + )dtdx1dx2dx3df1 ,
f = 1 +

r4
r4 ,

r4  4gs2n .

(3.3)

note that since gtt is non-constant, the energy ep of an object as measured by an
observer at a constant position r and the energy e measured by an observer at innity
are related by the redshift factor

e = f1/4ep .

(3.4)

56

this means that the same object brought closer and closer to r = 0 would appear to
have lower and lower energy for the observer at innity. now we take the low energy
limit in the background described by equation (3.3). there are two kinds of low energy
excitations (from the point of view of an observer at innity). we can have massless
particles propagating in the bulk region with wavelengths that becomes very large, or
we can have any kind of excitation that we bring closer and closer to r = 0. in the
low energy limit these two types of excitations decouple from each other. the bulk
massless particles decouple from the near horizon region (around r = 0) because the
low energy absorption cross section goes like   3r8 [9, 10], where  is the energy.
this can be understood from the fact that in this limit the wavelength of the particle
becomes much bigger than the typical gravitational size of the brane (which is of order
r). similarly, the excitations that live very close to r = 0 nd it harder and harder to
climb the gravitational potential and escape to the asymptotic region. in conclusion,
the low energy theory consists of two decoupled pieces, one is free bulk supergravity
and the second is the near horizon region of the geometry. in the near horizon region,
r  r, we can approximate f  r4/r4, and the geometry becomes
r2 + r2d2
5,

3) + r2 dr2

1 + dx2

2 + dx2

(3.5)

ds2 =

r2
r2 (dt2 + dx2
which is the geometry of ads5  s5.

we see that both from the point of view of a eld theory of open strings living
on the brane, and from the point of view of the supergravity description, we have
two decoupled theories in the low-energy limit.
in both cases one of the decoupled
systems is supergravity in at space. so, it is natural to identify the second system
which appears in both descriptions. thus, we are led to the conjecture that n = 4
u(n) super-yang-mills theory in 3 + 1 dimensions is the same as (or dual to) type iib
superstring theory on ads5  s5 [5].

we could be a bit more precise about the near horizon limit and how it is being
taken. suppose that we take   0, as we did when we discussed the eld theory
living on the brane. we want to keep xed the energies of the objects in the throat
(the near-horizon region) in string units, so that we can consider arbitrary excited

string states there. this implies that ep  xed. for small  (3.4) reduces to
e  epr/. since we want to keep xed the energy measured from innity, which
is the way energies are measured in the eld theory, we need to take r  0 keeping
r/ xed. it is then convenient to dene a new variable u  r/, so that the metric
becomes
ds2 = "

(dt2 + dx2

4gsn

(3.6)

1 + dx2

2 + dx2

u 2

du 2

this can also be seen by considering a d3 brane sitting at ~r. as discussed in section

57

1.3 this corresponds to giving a vacuum expectation value to one of the scalars in the
yang-mills theory. when we take the   0 limit we want to keep the mass of the
w -boson xed. this mass, which is the mass of the string stretching between the
branes sitting at ~r = 0 and the one at ~r, is proportional to u = r/, so this quantity
should remain xed in the decoupling limit.

a u(n) gauge theory is essentially equivalent to a free u(1) vector multiplet times
an su(n) gauge theory, up to some zn identications (which aect only global issues).
in the dual string theory all modes interact with gravity, so there are no decoupled
modes. therefore, the bulk ads theory is describing the su(n) part of the gauge
theory. in fact we were not precise when we said that there were two sets of excitations
at low energies, the excitations in the asymptotic at space and the excitations in
the near horizon region. there are also some zero modes which live in the region
connecting the throat (the near horizon region) with the bulk, which correspond to
the u(1) degrees of freedom mentioned above. the u(1) vector supermultiplet includes
six scalars which are related to the center of mass motion of all the branes [148]. from
the ads point of view these zero modes live at the boundary, and it looks like we might
or might not decide to include them in the ads theory. depending on this choice we
could have a correspondence to an su(n) or a u(n) theory. the u(1) center of mass
degree of freedom is related to the topological theory of b-elds on ads [149]; if one
imposes local boundary conditions for these b-elds at the boundary of ads one nds
a u(1) gauge eld living at the boundary [150], as is familiar in chern-simons theories
[22, 151]. these modes living at the boundary are sometimes called singletons (or
doubletons) [152, 125, 153, 85, 86, 154, 155, 156, 157].

as we saw in section 2.2, anti-de-sitter space has a large group of isometries, which
is so(4, 2) for the case at hand. this is the same group as the conformal group in 3 + 1
dimensions. thus, the fact that the low-energy eld theory on the brane is conformal
is reected in the fact that the near horizon geometry is anti-de-sitter space. we also
have some supersymmetries. the number of supersymmetries is twice that of the full
solution (3.3) containing the asymptotic region [148]. this doubling of supersymmetries
is viewed in the eld theory as a consequence of superconformal invariance (section
2.2.3), since the superconformal algebra has twice as many fermionic generators as the
corresponding poincare superalgebra. we also have an so(6) symmetry which rotates
the s5. this can be identied with the su(4)r r-symmetry group of the eld theory.
in fact, the whole supergroup is the same for the n = 4 eld theory and the ads5 s5
geometry, so both sides of the conjecture have the same spacetime symmetries. we
will discuss in more detail the matching between the two sides of the correspondence
in section 3.2.

in the above derivation the eld theory is naturally dened on r3,1, but we saw
in section 2.2.1 that we could also think of the conformal eld theory as dened on

58

s3  r by redening the hamiltonian. since the isometries of ads are in one to
one correspondence with the generators of the conformal group of the eld theory, we
can conclude that this new hamiltonian 1
2 (p0 + k0) can be associated on ads to the
generator of translations in global time. this formulation of the conjecture is more
useful since in the global coordinates there is no horizon. when we put the eld theory
on s3 the coulomb branch is lifted and there is a unique ground state. this is due
to the fact that the scalars i in the eld theory are conformally coupled, so there is

a term of the form r d4xtr(2)r in the lagrangian, where r is the curvature of the

four-dimensional space on which the theory is dened. due to the positive curvature
of s3 this leads to a mass term for the scalars [19], lifting the moduli space.

the parameter n appears on the string theory side as the ux of the ve-form

ramond-ramond eld strength on the s5,

zs 5

f5 = n.

(3.7)

from the physics of d-branes we know that the yang-mills coupling is related to the
string coupling through [6, 158]

where we have also included the relationship of the  angle to the expectation value
of the rr scalar . we have written the couplings in this fashion because both the
gauge theory and the string theory have an sl(2, z) self-duality symmetry under which
  (a + b)/(c + d) (where a, b, c, d are integers with ad  bc = 1). in fact, sl(2, z)
is a conjectured strong-weak coupling duality symmetry of type iib string theory in
at space [159], and it should also be a symmetry in the present context since all the
elds that are being turned on in the ads5  s5 background (the metric and the ve
form eld strength) are invariant under this symmetry. the connection between the
sl(2, z) duality symmetries of type iib string theory and n = 4 sym was noted in
[160, 161, 162]. the string theory seems to have a parameter that does not appear
in the gauge theory, namely , which sets the string tension and all other scales in
the string theory. however, this is not really a parameter in the theory if we do not
compare it to other scales in the theory, since only relative scales are meaningful. in
fact, only the ratio of the radius of curvature to  is a parameter, but not  and
the radius of curvature independently. thus,  will disappear from any nal physical
quantity we compute in this theory. it is sometimes convenient, especially when one is
doing gravity calculations, to set the radius of curvature to one. this can be achieved
by writing the metric as ds2 = r2ds2, and rewriting everything in terms of g. with

these conventions gn  1/n 2 and   1/gsn . this implies that any quantity

calculated purely in terms of the gravity solution, without including stringy eects,

59

will be independent of gsn and will depend only on n.  corrections to the gravity
results give corrections which are proportional to powers of 1/gsn .

now, let us address the question of the validity of various approximations. the
analysis of loop diagrams in the eld theory shows that we can trust the perturbative
analysis in the yang-mills theory when

g2
y m n  gsn 

r4
s  1.
l4
y m n to be small and not just g2

(3.9)

note that we need g2
y m . on the other hand, the
classical gravity description becomes reliable when the radius of curvature r of ads
and of s5 becomes large compared to the string length,

r4
s  gsn  g2
l4

y m n  1.

(3.10)

we see that the gravity regime (3.10) and the perturbative eld theory regime (3.9)
are perfectly incompatible.
in this fashion we avoid any obvious contradiction due
to the fact that the two theories look very dierent. this is the reason that this
correspondence is called a duality. the two theories are conjectured to be exactly
the same, but when one side is weakly coupled the other is strongly coupled and vice
versa. this makes the correspondence both hard to prove and useful, as we can solve
a strongly coupled gauge theory via classical supergravity. notice that in (3.9)(3.10)
we implicitly assumed that gs < 1.
if gs > 1 we can perform an sl(2, z) duality
transformation and get conditions similar to (3.9)(3.10) but with gs  1/gs. so,
we cannot get into the gravity regime (3.10) by taking n small (n = 1, 2, ..) and
gs very large, since in that case the d-string becomes light and renders the gravity
approximation invalid. another way to see this is to note that the radius of curvature
in planck units is r4/l4
p  n. so, it is always necessary, but not sucient, to have
large n in order to have a weakly coupled supergravity description.

one might wonder why the above argument was not a proof rather than a conjecture.
it is not a proof because we did not treat the string theory non-perturbatively (not
even non-perturbatively in ). we could also consider dierent forms of the conjecture.
in its weakest form the gravity description would be valid for large gsn, but the full
string theory on ads might not agree with the eld theory. a not so weak form would
say that the conjecture is valid even for nite gsn, but only in the n   limit
(so that the  corrections would agree with the eld theory, but the gs corrections
may not). the strong form of the conjecture, which is the most interesting one and
which we will assume here, is that the two theories are exactly the same for all values
in this conjecture the spacetime is only required to be asymptotic to
of gs and n.
ads5  s5 as we approach the boundary.
in the interior we can have all kinds of
60

processes; gravitons, highly excited fundamental string states, d-branes, black holes,
etc. even the topology of spacetime can change in the interior. the yang-mills theory
is supposed to eectively sum over all spacetimes which are asymptotic to ads5  s5.
this is completely analogous to the usual conditions of asymptotic atness. we can
have black holes and all kinds of topology changing processes, as long as spacetime is
asymptotically at. in this case asymptotic atness is replaced by the asymptotic ads
behavior.

3.1.1 brane probes and multicenter solutions
the moduli space of vacua of the n = 4 u(n) gauge theory is (r6)n /sn , parametriz-
ing the positions of the n branes in the six dimensional transverse space.
in the
supergravity solution one can replace

f 

n
r4 

nxi=1

1

|~r  ~ri|4 ,

(3.11)

and still have a solution to the supergravity equations. we see that if |~r|  |~ri| then
the two solutions are basically the same, while when we go to r  ri the solution starts
looking like the solution of a single brane. of course, we cannot trust the supergravity
solution for a single brane (since the curvature in planck units is proportional to a
negative power of n). what we can do is separate the n branes into groups of ni
branes with gsni  1 for all i. then we can trust the gravity solution everywhere.

another possibility is to separate just one brane (or a small number of branes)
from a group of n branes. then we can view this brane as a d3-brane in the ads5
background which is generated by the other branes (as described above). a string
stretching between the brane probe and the n branes appears in the gravity description
as a string stretching between the d3-brane and the horizon of ads. this seems a bit
surprising at rst since the proper distance to the horizon is innite. however, we get
a nite result for the energy of this state once we remember to include the redshift
factor. the d3-branes in ads (like any d3-branes in string theory) are described at
low energies by the born-infeld action, which is the yang-mills action plus some higher
derivative corrections. this seems to contradict, at rst sight, the fact that the dual
eld theory (coming from the original branes) is just the pure yang-mills theory. in
order to understand this point more precisely let us write explicitly the bosonic part

61

(3.12)
where i are angular coordinates on the 5-sphere. we can easily check that if we dene
a new coordinate u = r/, then all the  dependence drops out of this action. since
u (which has dimensions of energy) corresponds to the mass of the w bosons in this
conguration, it is the natural way to express the higgs expectation value that breaks
u(n + 1) to u(n)u(1). in fact, the action (3.12) is precisely the low-energy eective
action in the eld theory for the massless u(1) degrees of freedom, that we obtain after
integrating out the massive degrees of freedom (w bosons). we can expand (3.12)
in powers of u and we see that the quadratic term does not have any correction,
which is consistent with the non-renormalization theorem for n = 4 super-yang-mills
[163]. the (u)4 term has only a one-loop correction, and this is also consistent with
another non-renormalization theorem [164]. this one-loop correction can be evaluated
explicitly in the gauge theory and the result agrees with the supergravity result [165].
it is possible to argue, using broken conformal invariance, that all terms in (3.12) are
determined by the (u)4 term [5]. since the massive degrees of freedom that we are
integrating out have a mass proportional to u, the action (3.12) makes sense as long
as the energies involved are much smaller than u. in particular, we need u/u  u.
since (3.12) has the form l(gsn(u)2/u 4), the higher order terms in (3.12) could
become important in the supergravity regime, when gsn  1. the born infeld action
(3.12), as always, makes sense only when the curvature of the brane is small, but the
deviations from a straight at brane could be large. in this regime we can keep the
non-linear terms in (3.12) while we still neglect the massive string modes and similar
eects. further gauge theory calculations for eective actions of d-brane probes include
[166, 167, 168].

3.1.2 the field  operator correspondence

a conformal eld theory does not have asymptotic states or an s-matrix, so the natural
objects to consider are operators. for example, in n = 4 super-yang-mills we have a
deformation by a marginal operator which changes the value of the coupling constant.
changing the coupling constant in the eld theory is related by (3.8) to changing the
coupling constant in the string theory, which is then related to the expectation value of

62

the dilaton. the expectation value of the dilaton is set by the boundary condition for
the dilaton at innity. so, changing the gauge theory coupling constant corresponds
to changing the boundary value of the dilaton. more precisely, let us denote by o
the corresponding operator. we can consider adding the term r d4x0(~x)o(~x) to the
lagrangian (for simplicity we assume that such a term was not present in the original
lagrangian, otherwise we consider 0(~x) to be the total coecient of o(~x) in the
lagrangian). according to the discussion above, it is natural to assume that this
will change the boundary condition of the dilaton at the boundary of ads to (in the
coordinate system (2.31)) (~x, z)|z=0 = 0(~x). more precisely, as argued in [18, 19], it
is natural to propose that

her d4x0(~x)o(~x)icf t = zstring"(~x, z)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)z=0

= 0(~x)#,

(3.13)

where the left hand side is the generating function of correlation functions in the eld
theory, i.e. 0 is an arbitrary function and we can calculate correlation functions of o
by taking functional derivatives with respect to 0 and then setting 0 = 0. the right
hand side is the full partition function of string theory with the boundary condition
that the eld  has the value 0 on the boundary of ads. notice that 0 is a function
of the four variables parametrizing the boundary of ads5.

a formula like (3.13) is valid in general, for any eld . therefore, each eld prop-
agating on ads space is in a one to one correspondence with an operator in the eld
theory. there is a relation between the mass of the eld  and the scaling dimension
of the operator in the conformal eld theory. let us describe this more generally in
adsd+1. the wave equation in euclidean space for a eld of mass m has two indepen-
dent solutions, which behave like zd and z for small z (close to the boundary of
ads), where

 =

d
2

+s d2

4

+ r2m2.

(3.14)

therefore, in order to get consistent behavior for a massive eld, the boundary condi-
tion on the eld in the right hand side of (3.13) should in general be changed to

(~x, ) = d0(~x),

(3.15)

and eventually we would take the limit where   0. since  is dimensionless, we
see that 0 has dimensions of [length]d which implies, through the left hand side
of (3.13), that the associated operator o has dimension  (3.14). a more detailed
derivation of this relation will be given in section 3.3, where we will verify that the
two-point correlation function of the operator o behaves as that of an operator of
dimension  [18, 19]. a similar relation between elds on ads and operators in the

63

eld theory exists also for non-scalar elds, including fermions and tensors on ads
space.

correlation functions in the gauge theory can be computed from (3.13) by dierenti-
ating with respect to 0. each dierentiation brings down an insertion o, which sends
a  particle (a closed string state) into the bulk. feynman diagrams can be used to
compute the interactions of particles in the bulk. in the limit where classical super-
gravity is applicable, the only diagrams that contribute are the tree-level diagrams of
the gravity theory (see for instance gure 3.1).

figure 3.1: correlation functions can be calculated (in the large gsn limit) in terms of
supergravity feynman diagrams. here we see the leading contribution coming from a
disconnected diagram plus connected pieces involving interactions of the supergravity
elds in the bulk of ads. at tree level, these diagrams and those related to them by
crossing are the only ones that contribute to the four-point function.

this method of dening the correlation functions of a eld theory which is dual to
a gravity theory in the bulk of ads space is quite general, and it applies in principle
to any theory of gravity [19]. any local eld theory contains the stress tensor as an
operator. since the correspondence described above matches the stress-energy tensor
with the graviton, this implies that the ads theory includes gravity.
it should be
a well dened quantum theory of gravity since we should be able to compute loop
diagrams. string theory provides such a theory. but if a new way of dening quantum
gravity theories comes along we could consider those gravity theories in ads, and they
should correspond to some conformal eld theory on the boundary. in particular,
we could consider backgrounds of string theory of the form ads5  m 5 where m 5 is
any einstein manifold [169, 170, 171]. depending on the choice of m 5 we get dierent
dual conformal eld theories, as discussed in section 4.1. similarly, this discussion
can be extended to any adsd+1 space, corresponding to a conformal eld theory in d
spacetime dimensions (for d > 1). we will discuss examples of this in section 6.1.

3.1.3 holography

in this section we will describe how the ads/cft correspondence gives a holographic
description of physics in ads spaces.

let us start by explaining the bekenstein bound, which states that the maximum
entropy in a region of space is smax = area/4gn [26], where the area is that of the
boundary of the region. suppose that we had a state with more entropy than smax,
then we show that we could violate the second law of thermodynamics. we can throw
in some extra matter such that we form a black hole. the entropy should not decrease.
but if a black hole forms inside the region its entropy is just the area of its horizon,
which is smaller than the area of the boundary of the region (which by our assumption
is smaller than the initial entropy). so, the second law has been violated.

note that this bound implies that the number of degrees of freedom inside some
region grows as the area of the boundary of a region and not like the volume of the
region. in standard quantum eld theories this is certainly not possible. attempting
to understand this behavior leads to the holographic principle, which states that in
a quantum gravity theory all physics within some volume can be described in terms of
some theory on the boundary which has less than one degree of freedom per planck
area [24, 25] (so that its entropy satises the bekenstein bound).

in the ads/cft correspondence we are describing physics in the bulk of ads space
by a eld theory of one less dimension (which can be thought of as living on the
boundary), so it looks like holography. however, it is hard to check what the number
of degrees of freedom per planck area is, since the theory, being conformal, has an
innite number of degrees of freedom, and the area of the boundary of ads space is
also innite. thus, in order to compare things properly we should introduce a cuto
on the number of degrees of freedom in the eld theory and see what it corresponds to
in the gravity theory. for this purpose let us write the metric of ads as

ds2 = r2  1 + r2
1  r2!2

dt2 +

4

(1  r2)2 (dr2 + r2d2) .

(3.16)

in these coordinates the boundary of ads is at r = 1. we saw above that when we
calculate correlation functions we have to specify boundary conditions at r = 1  and
then take the limit of   0. it is clear by studying the action of the conformal group
on poincare coordinates that the radial position plays the role of some energy scale,
since we approach the boundary when we do a conformal transformation that localizes
objects in the cft. so, the limit   0 corresponds to going to the uv of the eld
theory. when we are close to the boundary we could also use the poincare coordinates

ds2 = r2dt2 + d~x2 + dz2

z2

,

65

(3.17)

in which the boundary is at z = 0.
if we consider a particle or wave propagating
in (3.17) or (3.16) we see that its motion is independent of r in the supergravity
approximation. furthermore, if we are in euclidean space and we have a wave that
has some spatial extent  in the ~x directions, it will also have an extent  in the z
direction. this can be seen from (3.17) by eliminating  through the change of variables
x  x, z  z. this implies that a cuto at
z  

(3.18)

corresponds to a uv cuto in the eld theory at distances , with no factors of r (
here is dimensionless, in the eld theory it is measured in terms of the radius of the s4
or s3 that the theory lives on). equation (3.18) is called the uv-ir relation [172].

consider the case of n = 4 sym on a three-sphere of radius one. we can estimate

the number of degrees of freedom in the eld theory with a uv cuto . we get

s  n 23,

(3.19)

since the number of cells into which we divide the three-sphere is of order 1/3. in the
gravity solution (3.16) the area in planck units of the surface at r = 1  , for   1,
is

(3.20)

area
4gn

=

vs 5r33

4gn  n 23.

thus, we see that the ads/cft correspondence saturates the holographic bound [172].
one could be a little suspicious of the statement that gravity in ads is holographic,
since it does not seem to be saying much because in ads space the volume and the
boundary area of a given region scale in the same fashion as we increase the size of
the region. in fact, any eld theory in ads would be holographic in the sense that
the number of degrees of freedom within some (large enough) volume is proportional
to the area (and also to the volume). what makes this case dierent is that we
have the additional parameter r, and then we can take ads spaces of dierent radii
(corresponding to dierent values of n in the sym theory), and then we can ask
whether the number of degrees of freedom goes like the volume or the area, since these
have a dierent dependence on r.

one might get confused by the fact that the surface r = 1   is really nine dimen-
sional as opposed to four dimensional. from the form of the full metric on ads5  s5
we see that as we take   0 the physical size of four of the dimensions of this nine
dimensional space grow, while the other ve, the s5, remain constant. so, we see
that the theory on this nine dimensional surface becomes eectively four dimensional,
since we need to multiply the metric by a factor that goes to zero as we approach the
boundary in order to dene a nite metric for the four dimensional gauge theory.

66

note that even though it is often said that the eld theory is dened on the boundary
of ads, it actually describes all the physics that is going on inside ads. when we are
thinking in the ads picture it is incorrect to consider at the same time an additional
eld theory living at the boundary1. dierent regions of ads space, which are at
dierent radial positions, correspond to physics at dierent energy scales in the eld
it is interesting that depending on what boundary we take, r3+1 (in the
theory.
poincare coordinates) or s3  r (in the global coordinates), we can either have a
horizon or not have one. the presence of a horizon in the r3+1 case is related to the
fact that the theory has no mass gap and we can have excitations at arbitrarily low
energies. this will always happen when we have a horizon, since by bringing a particle
close to a horizon its energy becomes arbitrarily small. we are talking about the energy
measured with respect to the time associated to the killing vector that vanishes at the
horizon. in the s3 case there is no horizon, and correspondingly the theory has a gap.
in this case the eld theory has a discrete spectrum since it is in nite volume.

figure 3.2: derivation of the ir/uv relation by considering a spatial geodesic ending
at two points on the boundary.

now let us consider the uv/ir correspondence in spaces that are not ads, like the
ones which correspond to the eld theories living on d-p-branes with p 6= 3 (see section
6.1.3). a simple derivation involves considering a classical spatial geodesic that ends
on the boundary at two points separated by a distance l in eld theory units (see
gure 3.2). this geodesic goes into the bulk, and it has a point at which the distance
to the boundary is maximal. let us call this point rmax(l). then, one formulation of
the uv/ir relation is

a similar criterion arises if we consider the wave equation instead of classical geodesics

1except possibly for a small number of singleton elds.

[173]; of course both are the same since a classical geodesic arises as a limit of the wave
equation for very massive particles.

since the radial direction arises holographically, it is not obvious at rst sight that
the theory will be causal in the bulk. issues of causality in the holographic description
of the spacetime physics were discussed in [174, 175, 176, 177].

this holographic description has implications for the physics of black holes. this
description should therefore explain how the singularity inside black holes should be
treated (see [178]). holography also implies that black hole evolution is unitary since
the boundary theory is unitary. it is not totally clear, from the gravity point of view,
how the information comes back out or where it is stored (see [179] for a discussion).
some speculations about holography and a new uncertainty principles were discussed
in [180].

3.2 tests of the ads/cft correspondence

in this section we review the direct tests of the ads/cft correspondence. in section
3.1 we saw how string theory on ads denes a partition function which can be used
to dene a eld theory. here we will review the evidence showing that this eld theory
is indeed the same as the conjectured dual eld theory. we will focus here only on
tests of the correspondence between the n = 4 su(n) sym theory and the type
iib string theory compactied on ads5  s5; most of the tests described here can be
generalized also to cases in other dimensions and/or with less supersymmetry, which
will be described below.

as described in section 3.1, the ads/cft correspondence is a strong/weak coupling
duality. in the t hooft large n limit, it relates the region of weak eld theory coupling
 = g2
y m n in the sym theory to the region of high curvature (in string units) in the
string theory, and vice versa. thus, a direct comparison of correlation functions is
generally not possible, since (with our current knowledge) we can only compute most
of them perturbatively in  on the eld theory side and perturbatively in 1/ on the
string theory side. for example, as described below, we can compute the equation of
state of the sym theory and also the quark-anti-quark potential both for small  and
for large , and we obtain dierent answers, which we do not know how to compare
since we can only compute them perturbatively on both sides. a similar situation
arises also in many eld theory dualities that were analyzed in the last few years (such
as the electric/magnetic sl(2, z) duality of the n = 4 sym theory itself), and it was
realized that there are several properties of these theories which do not depend on the
coupling, so they can be compared to test the duality. these are :

 the global symmetries of the theory, which cannot change as we change the

68

coupling (except for extreme values of the coupling). as discussed in section
3.1, in the case of the ads/cft correspondence we have the same supergroup
su(2, 2|4) (whose bosonic subgroup is so(4, 2) su(4)) as the global symmetry
of both theories. also, both theories are believed to have a non-perturbative
sl(2, z) duality symmetry acting on their coupling constant  . these are the
only symmetries of the theory on r4. additional zn symmetries arise when the
theories are compactied on non-simply-connected manifolds, and these were also
successfully matched in [181, 149]2.

 some correlation functions, which are usually related to anomalies, are protected
from any quantum corrections and do not depend on . the matching of these
correlation functions will be described in section 3.2.2 below.

 the spectrum of chiral operators does not change as the coupling varies, and it

will be compared in section 3.2.1 below.

 the moduli space of the theory also does not depend on the coupling. in the
su(n) eld theory the moduli space is r6(n1)/sn , parametrized by the eigen-
values of six commuting traceless n  n matrices. on the ads side it is not
clear exactly how to dene the moduli space. as described in section 3.1.1, there
is a background of string theory corresponding to any point in the eld theory
moduli space, but it is not clear how to see that this is the exact moduli space
on the string theory side (especially since high curvatures arise for generic points
in the moduli space).

 the qualitative behavior of the theory upon deformations by relevant or marginal
operators also does not depend on the coupling (at least for chiral operators
whose dimension does not depend on the coupling, and in the absence of phase
transitions). this will be discussed in section 4.3.

there are many more qualitative tests of the correspondence, such as the exis-
tence of connement for the nite temperature theory [182], which we will not
discuss in this section. we will also not discuss here tests involving the behavior
of the theory on its moduli space [166, 183, 167].

2unlike most of the other tests described here, this test actually tests the nite n duality and not

just the large n limit.

3.2.1 the spectrum of chiral primary operators

the field theory spectrum

the n = 4 supersymmetry algebra in d = 4 has four generators qa
 (and their complex
conjugates q a), where  is a weyl-spinor index (in the 2 of the so(3, 1) lorentz
group) and a is an index in the 4 of the su(4)r r-symmetry group (lower indices a
will be taken to transform in the 4 representation). they obey the algebra

(3.22)

where i (i = 1, 2, 3) are the pauli matrices and (0)  =   (we use the conventions
of wess and bagger [184]).

n = 4 supersymmetry in four dimensions has a unique multiplet which does not
include spins greater than one, which is the vector multiplet. it includes a vector eld
a ( is a vector index of the so(3, 1) lorentz group), four complex weyl fermions a
(in the 4 of su(4)r), and six real scalars i (where i is an index in the 6 of su(4)r).
the classical action of the supersymmetry generators on these elds is schematically
given (for on-shell elds) by

(3.23)

with similar expressions for the action of the qs, where  are the generators of
the lorentz group in the spinor representation, d is the covariant derivative, the
eld strength f  [d,d], and we have suppressed the su(4) clebsch-gordan
coecients corresponding to the products 4  6  4, 4  4  1 + 15 and 4  4  6
in the rst three lines of (3.23).

an n = 4 supersymmetric eld theory is uniquely determined by specifying the
gauge group, and its eld content is a vector multiplet in the adjoint of the gauge
group. such a eld theory is equivalent to an n = 2 theory with one hypermultiplet
in the adjoint representation, or to an n = 1 theory with three chiral multiplets i in
the adjoint representation (in the 32/3 of the su(3)  u(1)r  su(4)r which is left
unbroken by the choice of a single n = 1 susy generator) and a superpotential of the
form w  ijktr(ijk). the interactions of the theory include a scalar potential
proportional topi,j tr([i, j ]2), such that the moduli space of the theory is the space
of commuting matrices i (i = 1,   , 6).

70

the spectrum of operators in this theory includes all the gauge invariant quantities
that can be formed from the elds described above.
in this section we will focus
on local operators which involve elds taken at the same point in space-time. for
the su(n) theory described above, properties of the adjoint representation of su(n)
determine that such operators necessarily involve a product of traces of products of
elds (or the sum of such products). it is natural to divide the operators into single-
trace operators and multiple-trace operators. in the t hooft large n limit correlation
functions involving multiple-trace operators are suppressed by powers of n compared
to those of single-trace operators involving the same elds. we will discuss here in
detail only the single-trace operators; the multiple-trace operators appear in operator
product expansions of products of single-trace operators.

as discussed in section 2.1, it is natural to classify the operators in a conformal
theory into primary operators and their descendants. in a superconformal theory it
is also natural to distinguish between chiral primary operators, which are in short
representations of the superconformal algebra and are annihilated by some of the su-
percharges, and non-chiral primary operators. representations of the superconformal
algebra are formed by starting with some state of lowest dimension, which is anni-
hilated by the operators s and k, and acting on it with the operators q and p.
the n = 4 supersymmetry algebra involves 16 real supercharges. a generic primary
representation of the superconformal algebra will thus include 216 primaries of the
conformal algebra, generated by acting on the lowest state with products of dierent
supercharges; acting with additional supercharges always leads to descendants of the
conformal algebra (i.e. derivatives). since the supercharges have helicities 1/2, the
primary elds in such representations will have a range of helicities between   4 (if
the lowest dimension operator  has helicity ) and  + 4 (acting with more than 8
supercharges of the same helicity either annihilates the state or leads to a conformal
descendant). in non-generic representations of the superconformal algebra a product
of less than 16 dierent qs annihilates the lowest dimension operator, and the range
of helicities appearing is smaller.
in particular, in the small representations of the
n = 4 superconformal algebra only up to 4 qs of the same helicity acting on the
lowest dimension operator give a non-zero result, and the range of helicities is between
  2 and  + 2. for the n = 4 supersymmetry algebra (not including the conformal
algebra) it is known that medium representations, whose range of helicities is 6, can
also exist (they arise, for instance, on the moduli space of the su(n) n = 4 sym
theory [185, 186, 187, 188, 189, 190, 191, 192]); it is not clear if such medium repre-
sentations of the superconformal algebra [193] can appear in physical theories or not
(there are no known examples). more details on the structure of representations of the
n = 4 superconformal algebra may be found in [83, 194, 195, 196, 197, 198, 193] and
references therein.

71

in the u(1) n = 4 sym theory (which is a free theory), the only gauge-invariant
single trace operators are the elds of the vector multiplet itself (which are i, a, a
and f = [a]). these operators form an ultra-short representation of the n = 4
algebra whose range of helicities is from (1) to 1 (acting with more than two su-
percharges of the same helicity on any of these states gives either zero or derivatives,
which are descendants of the conformal algebra). all other local gauge invariant op-
erators in the theory involve derivatives or products of these operators. this rep-
resentation is usually called the doubleton representation, and it does not appear
in the su(n) sym theory (though the representations which do appear can all be
formed by tensor products of the doubleton representation).
in the context of ads
space one can think of this multiplet as living purely on the boundary of the space
[199, 200, 201, 202, 203, 85, 84, 204, 205, 206, 207], as expected for the u(1) part of
the original u(n) gauge group of the d3-branes (see the discussion in section 3.1).

there is no known simple systematic way to compute the full spectrum of chiral
primary operators of the n = 4 su(n) sym theory, so we will settle for presenting the
known chiral primary operators. the lowest component of a superconformal-primary
multiplet is characterized by the fact that it cannot be written as a supercharge q
acting on any other operator. looking at the action of the supersymmetry charges
(3.23) suggests that generally operators built from the fermions and the gauge elds
will be descendants (given by q acting on some other elds), so one would expect
the lowest components of the chiral primary representations to be built only from the
scalar elds, and this turns out to be correct.

let us analyze the behavior of operators of the form oi1i2in  tr(i1i2    in).
first we can ask if this operator can be written as {q, } for any eld .
in the
susy algebra (3.23) only commutators of is appear on the right hand side, so we see
that if some of the indices are antisymmetric the eld will be a descendant. thus, only
symmetric combinations of the indices will be lowest components of primary multiplets.
next, we should ask if the multiplet built on such an operator is a (short) chiral
primary multiplet or not. there are several dierent ways to answer this question.
one possibility is to use the relation between the dimension of chiral primary operators
and their r-symmetry representation [92, 93, 94, 91, 95], and to check if this relation
is obeyed in the free eld theory, where [oi1i2in] = n. in this way we nd that the
representation is chiral primary if and only if the indices form a symmetric traceless
product of n 6s (traceless representations are dened as those who give zero when
any two indices are contracted). this is a representation of weight (0, n, 0) of su(4)r;
in this section we will refer to su(4)r representations either by their dimensions in
boldface or by their weights.

another way to check this is to see if by acting with qs on these operators we get the
most general possible states or not, namely if the representation contains null vectors

72

or not (it turns out that in all the relevant cases null vectors appear already at the
rst level by acting with a single q, though in principle there could be representations
where null vectors appear only at higher levels). using the susy algebra (3.23)
it is easy to see that for symmetric traceless representations we get null vectors
while for other representations we do not. for instance, let us analyze in detail the
case n = 2. the symmetric product of two 6s is given by 6  6  1 + 20. the
eld in the 1 representation is tr(ii), for which [qa
 , tr(ii)]  c ajbtr(bj )
where c aib is a clebsch-gordan coecient for 4  6  4. the right-hand side is
in the 4 representation, which is the most general representation that can appear in
the product 4  1, so we nd no null vectors at this level. on the other hand, if we
look at the symmetric traceless product tr({ij})  tr(ij) 1
6ij tr(kk) in the
 , tr({ij})}  tr(bk) with the right-hand
20 representation, we nd that {qa
side being in the 20 representation (appearing in 4  6  4 + 20), while the left-hand
side could in principle be in the 4  20  20 + 60. since the 60 does not appear on
the right-hand side (it is a null vector) we identify that the representation built on
the 20 is a short representation of the susy algebra. by similar manipulations (see
[19, 208, 194, 197] for more details) one can verify that chiral primary representations
correspond exactly to symmetric traceless products of 6s.

it is possible to analyze the chiral primary spectrum also by using n = 1 subalgebras
of the n = 4 algebra. if we use an n = 1 subalgebra of the n = 4 algebra, as described
above, the operators on include the chiral operators of the form tr(i1i2    in) (in
a representation of su(3) which is a symmetric product of 3s), but for a particular
choice of the n = 1 subalgebra not all the operators on appear to be chiral (a short
multiplet of the n = 4 algebra includes both short and long multiplets of the n = 1
subalgebra).

the last issue we should discuss is what is the range of values of n. the product
of more than n commuting3 n  n matrices can always be written as a sum of
products of traces of less than n of the matrices, so it does not form an independent
operator. this means that for n > n we can express the operator oi1i2in in terms
of other operators, up to operators including commutators which (as explained above)
are descendants of the susy algebra. thus, we nd that the short chiral primary
representations are built on the operators on = o{i1i2in} with n = 2, 3,   , n, for
which the indices are in the symmetric traceless product of n 6s (in a u(n) theory
we would nd the same spectrum with the additional representation corresponding to
n = 1). the superconformal algebra determines the dimension of these elds to be
[on] = n, which is the same as their value in the free eld theory. we argued above
3we can limit the discussion to commuting matrices since, as discussed above, commutators always
lead to descendants, and we can write any product of matrices as a product of commuting matrices
plus terms with commutators.

73

that these are the only short chiral primary representations in the su(n) gauge theory,
but we will not attempt to rigorously prove this here.

the full chiral primary representations are obtained by acting on the elds on by
the generators q and p of the supersymmetry algebra. the representation built on
on contains a total of 256  1
12n2(n2  1) primary states, of which half are bosonic
and half are fermionic. since these multiplets are built on a eld of helicity zero, they
will contain primary elds of helicities between (2) and 2. the highest dimension
primary eld in the multiplet is (generically) of the form q4 q4on, and its dimension
is n + 4. there is an elegant way to write these multiplets as traces of products of
twisted chiral n = 4 superelds [208, 194], but we will not present it here.

2). if we act with two supercharges qa

it is easy to nd the form of all the elds in such a multiplet by using the algebra
(3.23). for example, let us analyze here in detail the bosonic primary elds of dimension
n + 1 in the multiplet. to get a eld of dimension n + 1 we need to act on on with two
supercharges (recall that [q] = 1
 of the same
chirality, their lorentz indices can be either antisymmetrized or symmetrized. in the
rst case we get a lorentz scalar eld in the (2, n  2, 0) representation of su(4)r,
which is of the schematic form
{q, [q,on]}  tr(abj1    jn2) + tr([k1, k2]l1    ln1). (3.24)
using an n = 1 subalgebra some of these operators may be written as the lowest
components of the chiral superelds tr(w 2
j1    jn2). in the second case we get
an anti-symmetric 2-form of the lorentz group, in the (0, n  1, 0) representation of
su(4)r, of the form

{q{, [q},on]}  tr(()fj1    jn1) + tr(abk1    kn2).

(3.25)

both of these elds are complex, with the complex conjugate elds given by the action
of two qs. acting with one q and one q on the state on gives a (real) lorentz-vector
eld in the (1, n  2, 1) representation of su(4)r, of the form

{q, [ q ,on]}  tr(ab

the spectrum of primary elds at dimension n+3 is similar to that of dimension n+1
(the same elds appear but in smaller su(4)r representations), and at dimension n + 4
there is a single primary eld, which is a real scalar in the (0, n  4, 0) representation,
given by q4 q4on, of the form tr(f 4
i1    in4) +   . note that elds with more
than four fs or more than eight s are always descendants or non-chiral primaries.
for n = 2, 3 the short multiplets are even shorter since some of the representations
appearing above vanish. in particular, for n = 2 the highest-dimension primaries in the
chiral primary multiplet have dimension n + 2 = 4. the n = 2 representation includes
the currents of the superconformal algebra. it includes a vector of dimension 3 in the
15 representation which is the su(4)r r-symmetry current, and a symmetric tensor
eld of dimension 4 which is the energy-momentum tensor (the other currents of the
superconformal algebra are descendants of these). the n = 2 multiplet also includes
a complex scalar eld which is an su(4)r-singlet, whose real part is the lagrangian

density coupling to
lagrangian density coupling to  (of the form tr(f  f )). for later use we note that
the chiral primary multiplets which contain scalars of dimension   4 are the n = 2
multiplet (which has a scalar in the 20 of dimension 2, a complex scalar in the 10 of
dimension 3, and a complex scalar in the 1 of dimension 4), the n = 3 multiplet (which
contains a scalar in the 50 of dimension 3 and a complex scalar in the 45 of dimension
4), and the n = 4 multiplet which contains a scalar in the 105 of dimension 4.

the string theory spectrum and the matching

as discussed in section 3.1.2, elds on ads5 are in a one-to-one correspondence with
operators in the dual conformal eld theory. thus, the spectrum of operators described
in section 3.2.1 should agree with the spectrum of elds of type iib string theory on
ads5  s5. fields on ads naturally lie in the same multiplets of the conformal group
as primary operators; the second casimir of these representations is c2 = ( 4) for
a primary scalar eld of dimension  in the eld theory, and c2 = m2r2 for a eld of
mass m on an ads5 space with a radius of curvature r. single-trace operators in the
eld theory may be identied with single-particle states in ads5, while multiple-trace
operators correspond to multi-particle states.

unfortunately, it is not known how to compute the full spectrum of type iib string
theory on ads5 s5. in fact, the only known states are the states which arise from the

75

dimensional reduction of the ten-dimensional type iib supergravity multiplet. these
elds all have helicities between (2) and 2, so it is clear that they all lie in small mul-
tiplets of the superconformal algebra, and we will describe below how they match with
the small multiplets of the eld theory described above. string theory on ads5  s5 is
expected to have many additional states, with masses of the order of the string scale 1/ls
or of the planck scale 1/lp. such states would correspond (using the mass/dimension
relation described above) to operators in the eld theory with dimensions of order
  (gsn)1/4 or   n 1/4 for large n, gsn. presumably none of these states are in
small multiplets of the superconformal algebra (at least, this would be the prediction
of the ads/cft correspondence).

the spectrum of type iib supergravity compactied on ads5  s5 was computed in
[124]. the computation involves expanding the ten dimensional elds in appropriate
spherical harmonics on s5, plugging them into the supergravity equations of motion,
linearized around the ads5  s5 background, and diagonalizing the equations to give
equations of motion for free (massless or massive) elds4. for example, the ten dimen-
sional dilaton eld  may be expanded as  (x, y) =pk=0  k(x)y k(y) where x is a coor-
dinate on ads5, y is a coordinate on s5, and the y k are the scalar spherical harmonics
on s5. these spherical harmonics are in representations corresponding to symmetric
traceless products of 6s of su(4)r; they may be written as y k(y)  yi1yi2    yik
where the yi, for i = 1, 2,   , 6 and with p6
i=1(yi)2 = 1, are coordinates on s5. thus,
we nd a eld  k(x) on ads5 in each such (0, k, 0) representation of su(4)r, and the
equations of motion determine the mass of this eld to be m2
k = k(k + 4)/r2. a similar
expansion may be performed for all other elds.

if we organize the results of [124] into representations of the superconformal algebra
[83], we nd representations of the form described in the previous section, which are
built on a lowest dimension eld which is a scalar in the (0, n, 0) representation of
su(4)r for n = 2, 3,   ,. the lowest dimension scalar eld in each representation
turns out to arise from a linear combination of spherical harmonic modes of the s5
components of the graviton ha
a (expanded around the ads5  s5 vacuum) and the
4-form eld dabcd, where a, b, c, d are indices on s5. the scalar elds of dimension
n + 1 correspond to 2-form elds bab with indices in the s5. the symmetric tensor
elds arise from the expansion of the ads5-components of the graviton. the dilaton
elds described above are the complex scalar elds arising with dimension n + 2 in the
multiplet (as described in the previous subsection).

in particular, the n = 2 representation is called the supergraviton representation, and
it includes the eld content of d = 5,n = 8 gauged supergravity. the eld/operator
correspondence matches this representation to the representation including the super-

4the elds arising from dierent spherical harmonics are related by a spectrum generating alge-

bra, see [209].

76

conformal currents in the eld theory. it includes a massless graviton eld, which (as
expected) corresponds to the energy-momentum tensor in the eld theory, and massless
su(4)r gauge elds which correspond to (or couple to) the global su(4)r currents in
the eld theory.

in the naive dimensional reduction of the type iib supergravity elds, the n = 1
doubleton representation, corresponding to a free u(1) vector multiplet in the dual
theory, also appears. however, the modes of this multiplet are all pure gauge modes in
the bulk of ads5, and they may be set to zero there. this is one of the reasons why it
seems more natural to view the corresponding gauge theory as an su(n) gauge theory
and not a u(n) theory.
it may be possible (and perhaps even natural) to add the
doubleton representation to the theory (even though it does not include modes which
propagate in the bulk of ads5, but instead it is equivalent to a topological theory in
the bulk) to obtain a theory which is dual to the u(n) gauge theory, but this will not
aect most of our discussion in this review so we will ignore this possibility here.

comparing the results described above with the results of section 3.2.1, we see that
we nd the same spectrum of chiral primary operators for n = 2, 3,   , n. the super-
gravity results cannot be trusted for masses above the order of the string scale (which
corresponds to n  (gsn)1/4) or the planck scale (which corresponds to n  n 1/4), so
the results agree within their range of validity. the eld theory results suggest that the
exact spectrum of chiral representations in type iib string theory on ads5s5 actually
matches the naive supergravity spectrum up to a mass scale m2  n 2/r2  n 3/2m 2
p
which is much higher than the string scale and the planck scale, and that there are no
chiral elds above this scale. it is not known how to check this prediction; tree-level
string theory is certainly not enough for this since when gs = 0 we must take n =  to
obtain a nite value of gsn. thus, with our current knowledge the matching of chiral
primaries of the n = 4 sym theory with those of string theory on ads5  s5 tests
the duality only in the large n limit. in some generalizations of the ads/cft corre-
spondence the string coupling goes to zero at the boundary even for nite n, and then
classical string theory should lead to exactly the same spectrum of chiral operators as
the eld theory. this happens in particular for the near-horizon limit of ns5-branes, in
which case the exact spectrum was successfully compared in [210]. in other instances
of the ads/cft correspondence (such as the ones discussed in [211, 212, 213]) there
exist also additional chiral primary multiplets with n of order n, and these have been
successfully matched with wrapped branes on the string theory side.

the fact that there seem to be no non-chiral elds on ads5 with a mass below the
string scale suggests that for large n and large gsn, the dimension of all non-chiral
y m n)1/4.
operators in the eld theory, such as tr(ii), grows at least as (gsn)1/4  (g2
the reason for this behavior on the eld theory side is not clear; it is a prediction of
the ads/cft correspondence.

3.2.2 matching of correlation functions and anomalies

the classical n = 4 theory has a scale invariance symmetry and an su(4)r r-
symmetry, and (unlike many other theories) these symmetries are exact also in the
full quantum theory. however, when the theory is coupled to external gravitational or
su(4)r gauge elds, these symmetries are broken by quantum eects. in eld theory
this breaking comes from one-loop diagrams and does not receive any further correc-
tions; thus it can be computed also in the strong coupling regime and compared with
the results from string theory on ads space.

we will begin by discussing the anomaly associated with the su(4)r global currents.
these currents are chiral since the fermions a are in the 4 representation while the
fermions of the opposite chirality a
 are in the 4 representation. thus, if we gauge the
su(4)r global symmetry, we will nd an adler-bell-jackiw anomaly from the triangle
diagram of three su(4)r currents, which is proportional to the number of charged
fermions. in the su(n) gauge theory this number is n 2  1. the anomaly can be
expressed either in terms of the 3-point function of the su(4)r global currents,

where dabc = 2tr(t a{t b, t c}) and we take only the negative parity component of the
correlator, or in terms of the non-conservation of the su(4)r current when the theory
is coupled to external su(4)r gauge elds f a

how can we see this eect in string theory on ads5  s5 ? one way to see it
is, of course, to use the general prescription of section 3.3 to compute the 3-point
function (3.27), and indeed one nds [214, 215] the correct answer to leading order
in the large n limit (namely, one recovers the term proportional to n 2). it is more
illuminating, however, to consider directly the meaning of the anomaly (3.28) from the
point of view of the ads theory [19]. in the ads theory we have gauge elds aa
 which
couple, as explained above, to the su(4)r global currents j a
 of the gauge theory, but
the anomaly means that when we turn on non-zero eld strengths for these elds the
theory should no longer be gauge invariant. this eect is precisely reproduced by a
chern-simons term which exists in the low-energy supergravity theory arising from the
compactication of type iib supergravity on ads5  s5, which is of the form

from this we can read o the anomaly in (dj) since, when we have a coupling of

, the change in the action under a gauge transformation is given by
r d4x(d)aj a
), and we nd exact agreement with (3.28) for large
the other anomaly in the n = 4 sym theory is the conformal (or weyl) anomaly
(see [216, 217] and references therein), indicating the breakdown of conformal invariance
when the theory is coupled to a curved external metric (there is a similar breakdown of
conformal invariance when the theory is coupled to external su(4)r gauge elds, which
we will not discuss here). the conformal anomaly is related to the 2-point and 3-point
functions of the energy-momentum tensor [218, 219, 72, 220]. in four dimensions, the
general form of the conformal anomaly is

 is the riemann tensor, and r  r

where r is the curvature tensor, r  r
 is
the scalar curvature. a free eld computation in the su(n) n = 4 sym theory leads
to a = c = (n 2  1)/4. in supersymmetric theories the supersymmetry algebra relates
gt to derivatives of the r-symmetry current, so it is protected from any quantum
corrections. thus, the same result should be obtained in type iib string theory on
ads5  s5, and to leading order in the large n limit it should be obtained from type
iib supergravity on ads5s5. this was indeed found to be true in [221, 222, 223, 224],
where the conformal anomaly was shown to arise from subtleties in the regularization
of the (divergent) supergravity action on ads space. the result of [221, 222, 223, 224]
implies that a computation using gravity on ads5 always gives rise to theories with
a = c, so generalizations of the ads/cft correspondence which have (for large n) a
supergravity approximation are limited to conformal theories which have a = c in the
large n limit. of course, if we do not require the string theory to have a supergravity
approximation then there is no such restriction.

for both of the anomalies we described the eld theory and string theory computa-
tions agree for the leading terms, which are of order n 2. thus, they are successful tests

79

of the duality in the large n limit. for other instances of the ads/cft correspondence
there are corrections to anomalies at order 1/n  gs(/r2)2; such corrections were
discussed in [225] and successfully compared in [226, 227, 228]5. it would be interesting
to compare other corrections to the large n result.

computations of other correlation functions [229, 230, 231], such as 3-point func-
tions of chiral primary operators and correlation functions which have only instanton
contributions (we will discuss these in section 4.2), have suggested that they are also
the same at small  and at large , even though they are not related to anomalies in
any known way. perhaps there is some non-renormalization theorem also for these cor-
relation functions, in which case their agreement would also be a test of the ads/cft
correspondence. as discussed in [232, 233] the non-renormalization theorem for 3-point
functions of chiral primary operators would follow from a conjectured u(1)y symmetry
of the 3-point functions of n = 4 scfts involving at least two operators which are
descendants of chiral primaries6. this symmetry is a property of type iib supergravity
on ads5  s5 but not of the full type iib string theory.

3.3 correlation functions

a useful statement of the ads/cft correspondence is that the partition function of
string theory on ads5 s5 should coincide with the partition function of n = 4 super-
yang-mills theory on the boundary of ads5 [18, 19]. the basic idea was explained
in section 3.1.2, but before summarizing the actual calculations of greens functions, it
seems worthwhile to motivate the methodology from a somewhat dierent perspective.
throughout this section, we approximate the string theory partition function by
eisu gra, where isu gra is the supergravity action evaluated on ads5 s5 (or on small
deformations of this space). this approximation amounts to ignoring all the stringy 
corrections that cure the divergences of supergravity, and also all the loop corrections,
which are controlled essentially by the gravitational coupling   gst2. on the gauge
theory side, as explained in section 3.1.2, this approximation amounts to taking both
n and g2

y m n large, and the basic relation becomes

eisu gra  zstring = zgauge = ew ,

(3.33)

where w = f is the free energy of the gauge theory divided by the temperature.
when we apply this relation to a schwarzschild black hole in ads5, which is thought

5computing such corrections tests the conjecture that the correspondence holds order by order in
1/n ; however, this is weaker than the statement that the correspondence holds for nite n , since the
1/n expansion is not expected to converge.

6a proof of this, using the analytic harmonic superspace formalism which is conjectured to be valid

in the n = 4 theory, was recently given in [234].

80

to be reected in the gauge theory by a thermal state at the hawking temperature of
the black hole, we arrive at the relation isu gra  f . calculating the free energy
of a black hole from the euclidean supergravity action has a long tradition in the
supergravity literature [235], so the main claim that is being made here is that the dual
gauge theory provides a description of the state of the black hole which is physically
equivalent to the one in string theory. we will discuss the nite temperature case
further in section 3.6, and devote the rest of this section to the partition function of
the eld theory on r4.

the main technical idea behind the bulk-boundary correspondence is that the bound-
ary values of string theory elds (in particular, supergravity elds) act as sources for
gauge-invariant operators in the eld theory. from a d-brane perspective, we think of
closed string states in the bulk as sourcing gauge singlet operators on the brane which
originate as composite operators built from open strings. we will write the bulk elds
generically as (~x, z) (in the coordinate system (3.17)), with value 0(~x) for z = .
the true boundary of anti-de sitter space is z = 0, and  6= 0 serves as a cuto which
will eventually be removed. in the supergravity approximation, we think of choosing
the values 0 arbitrarily and then extremizing the action isu gra[] in the region z > 
subject to these boundary conditions. in short, we solve the equations of motion in
the bulk subject to dirichlet boundary conditions on the boundary, and evaluate the
action on the solution. if there is more than one solution, then we have more than
one saddle point contributing to the string theory partition function, and we must
determine which is more important. in this section, multiple saddle points will not be
a problem. so, we can write

wgauge[0] =  logder d4x 0(x)o(x)ecf t  extremum
|z==0

isu gra[] .

(3.34)

that is, the generator of connected greens functions in the gauge theory, in the large
n, g2

y m n limit, is the on-shell supergravity action.

note that in (3.34) we have not attempted to be prescient about inserting factors
of . instead our strategy will be to use (3.34) without modication to compute two-
point functions of o, and then perform a wave-function renormalization on either o
or  so that the nal answer is independent of the cuto. this approach should be
workable even in a space (with boundary) which is not asymptotically anti-de sitter,
corresponding to a eld theory which does not have a conformal xed point in the
ultraviolet.

a remark is in order regarding the relation of (3.34) to the old approach of extracting
greens functions from an absorption cross-section [11]. in absorption calculations one
is keeping the whole d3-brane geometry, not just the near-horizon ads5  s5 throat.
the usual treatment is to split the space into a near region (the throat) and a far
region. the incoming wave from asymptotically at innity can be regarded as xing

81

the value of a supergravity eld at the outer boundary of the near region. as usual,
the supergravity description is valid at large n and large t hooft coupling. at small
t hooft coupling, there is a dierent description of the process: a cluster of d3-branes
sits at some location in at ten-dimensional space, and the incoming wave impinges
upon it. in the low-energy limit, the value of the supergravity eld which the d3-branes
feel is the same as the value in the curved space description at the boundary of the
near horizon region. equation (3.34) is just a mathematical expression of the fact that
the throat geometry should respond identically to the perturbed supergravity elds as
the low-energy theory on the d3-branes.

following [18, 19], a number of papersnotably [236, 237, 214, 238, 215, 239, 240,
229, 241, 230, 242, 243, 244, 245, 246, 247]have undertaken the program of extracting
explicit n-point correlation functions of gauge singlet operators by developing both sides
of (3.34) in a power series in 0. because the right hand side is the extremization of
a classical action, the power series has a graphical representation in terms of tree-level
feynman graphs for elds in the supergravity. there is one dierence:
in ordinary
feynman graphs one assigns the wavefunctions of asymptotic states to the external
legs of the graph, but in the present case the external leg factors reect the boundary
values 0. they are special limits of the usual gravity propagators in the bulk, and
are called bulk-to-boundary propagators. we will encounter their explicit form in the
next two sections.

3.3.1 two-point functions

for two-point functions, only the part of the action which is quadratic in the relevant
eld perturbation is needed. for massive scalar elds in ads5, this has the generic
form

s = z d5xgh 1

2 ()2 + 1

2m22i ,

where  is some normalization which in principle follows from the ten-dimensional
origin of the action. the bulk-to-boundary propagator is a particular solution of the
equation of motion, ( m2) = 0, which has special asymptotic properties. we will
start by considering the momentum space propagator, which is useful for computing
the two-point function and also in situations where the bulk geometry loses conformal
invariance; then, we will discuss the position space propagator, which has proven more
convenient for the study of higher point correlators in the conformal case. we will
always work in euclidean space7. a coordinate system in the bulk of ads5 such that

provides manifest euclidean symmetry on the directions parametrized by ~x. to avoid
divergences associated with the small z region of integration in (3.35), we will employ
an explicit cuto, z  .

a complete set of solutions for the linearized equation of motion, ( m2) = 0, is

given by  = ei~p~xz(pz), where the function z(u) satises the radial equation

(3.38)

the second solution is selected by the requirement of regularity in the interior: i2(u)
increases exponentially as u   and does not lead to a nite action conguration8.

several explanatory remarks are in order:

 to obtain the second line in (3.40) we have used (3.39), substituted in (3.35),
performed the integral and expanded in . the leading analytic terms give rise
to contact terms in position space, and the higher order terms are unimportant
in the limit where we remove the cuto. only the leading nonanalytic term is
essential. we have given the expression for generic real values of . expanding
around integer   2 one obtains nite expressions involving log p.

8note that this solution, when continued to lorentzian ads space, generally involves the non-

normalizable mode of the eld, with  in (2.34).

83

 the fourier transforms used to obtain the last line are singular, but they can be
dened for generic complex  by analytic continuation and for positive integer
 by expanding around a pole and dropping divergent terms, in the spirit of
dierential regularization [248]. the result is a pure power law dependence on
the separation |~x  ~y|, as required by conformal invariance.
 we have assumed a coupling r d4x (~x, z = )o(~x) to compute the greens func-
tions. the explicit powers of the cuto in the nal position space answer can
be eliminated by absorbing a factor of 4 into the denition of o. from here
on we will take that convention, which amounts to inserting a factor of 4 on
the right hand side of (3.39).
in fact, precise matchings between the normal-
izations in eld theory and in string theory for all the chiral primary operators
have not been worked out. in part this is due to the diculty of determining
the coupling of bulk elds to eld theory operators (or in stringy terms, the cou-
pling of closed string states to composite open string operators on the brane).
see [10] for an early approach to this problem. for the dilaton, the graviton,
and their superpartners (including gauge elds in ads5), the couplings can be
worked out explicitly. in some of these cases all normalizations have been worked
out unambiguously and checked against eld theory predictions (see for example
[18, 214, 230]).

 the mass-dimension relation (3.38) holds even for string states that are not in-
cluded in the kaluza-klein supergravity reduction: the mass and the dimension
are just dierent expressions of the second casimir of so(4, 2). for instance,

excited string states, with m  1/, are expected to correspond to operators
y m n)1/4. the remarkable fact is that all the string the-
with dimension   (g2
ory modes with m  1/r (which is to say, all closed string states which arise
from massless ten dimensional elds) fall in short multiplets of the supergroup
su(2, 2|4). all other states have a much larger mass. the operators in short
multiplets have algebraically protected dimensions. the obvious conclusion is
that all operators whose dimensions are not algebraically protected have large
dimension in the strong t hooft coupling, large n limit to which supergravity
applies. this is no longer true for theories of reduced supersymmetry: the su-
pergroup gets smaller, but the kaluza-klein states are roughly as numerous as
before, and some of them escape the short multiplets and live in long multiplets
of the smaller supergroups. they still have a mass on the order of 1/r, and
typically correspond to dimensions which are nite (in the large g2
y m n limit)
but irrational.

correlation functions of non-scalar operators have been widely studied following
[19]; the literature includes [249, 250, 251, 252, 253, 254, 255, 256, 257, 258, 259]. for

84

n = 4 super-yang-mills theory, all correlation functions of elds in chiral multiplets
should follow by application of supersymmetries once those of the chiral primary elds
are known, so in this case it should be enough to study the scalars. it is worthwhile
to note however that the mass-dimension formula changes for particles with spin. in
fact the denition of mass has some convention-dependence. conventions seem fairly
uniform in the literature, and a table of mass-dimension relations in adsd+1 with unit
radius was made in [143] from the various sources cited above (see also [208]):

2(d  d2 + 4m2),
 scalars:  = 1
 spinors:  = 1
2(d + 2|m|),
2(d q(d  2)2 + 4m2),
 vectors:  = 1
2(d q(d  2p)2 + 4m2),
 p-forms:  = 1
 rst-order (d/2)-forms (d even):  = 1
 spin-3/2:  = 1
 massless spin-2:  = d.

2(d + 2|m|),

2(d + 2|m|),

in the case of elds with second order lagrangians, we have not attempted to pick
which of  is the physical dimension. usually the choice  = + is clear from the
unitarity bound, but in some cases (notably m2 = 15/4 in ads5) there is a genuine
ambiguity. in practice this ambiguity is usually resolved by appealing to some special
algebraic property of the relevant elds, such as transformation under supersymmetry
or a global bosonic symmetry. see section 2.2.2 for further discussion. the scalar case
above is precisely equation (2.36) in that section.

for brevity we will omit a further discussion of higher spins, and instead refer the

reader to the (extensive) literature.

3.3.2 three-point functions

working with bulk-to-boundary propagators in the momentum representation is conve-
nient for two-point functions, but for higher point functions position space is preferred
because the full conformal invariance is more obvious. (however, for non-conformal ex-
amples of the bulk-boundary correspondence, the momentum representation seems uni-
formly more convenient). the boundary behavior of position space bulk-to-boundary
propagators is specied in a slightly more subtle way: following [214] we require

k(~x, z; ~y)  z44(~x  ~y)

as

z  0 .

(3.41)

85

here ~y is the point on the boundary where we insert the operator, and (~x, z) is a point
in the bulk. the unique regular k solving the equation of motion and satisfying
(3.41) is

k(~x, z; ~y) =

.

(3.42)

()

2(  2) 

z

z2 + (~x  ~y)2!

at a xed cuto, z = , the bulk-to-boundary propagator k(~x, ; ~y) is a continuous
function which approximates 44(~x  ~y) better and better as   0. thus at
any nite , the fourier transform of (3.42) only approximately coincides with (3.39)
(modied by the factor of 4 as explained after (3.40)). this apparently innocuous
subtlety turned out to be important for two-point functions, as discovered in [214].
a correct prescription is to specify boundary conditions at nite z = , cut o all
bulk integrals at that boundary, and only afterwards take   0. that is what we
have done in (3.40). calculating two-point functions directly using the position-space
propagators (3.41), but cutting the bulk integrals o again at , and nally taking the
same   0 answer, one arrives at a dierent answer. this is not surprising since the
z =  boundary conditions were not used consistently. the authors of [214] checked
that using the cuto consistently (i.e. with the momentum space propagators) gave
two-point functions ho(~x1)o(~x2)i a normalization such that ward identities involving
the three-point function ho(~x1)o(~x2)j(~x3)i, where j is a conserved current, were
obeyed. two-point functions are uniquely dicult because of the poor convergence
properties of the integrals over z. the integrals involved in three-point functions are
suciently benign that one can ignore the issue of how to impose the cuto.

if one has a euclidean bulk action for three scalar elds 1, 2, and 3, of the form

i + 123# ,

(3.43)

and if the i couple to operators in the eld theory by interaction terms r d4x ioi,
then the calculation of ho1o2o3i reduces, via (3.34), to the evaluation of the graph
shown in gure 3.3. that is,

ho1(~x1)o2(~x2)o3(~x3)i = z d5xgk1(x; ~x1)k2(x; ~x2)k3(x; ~x3)

for some constant a1. the dependence on the ~xi is dictated by the conformal invariance,
but the only way to compute a1 is by performing the integral over x. the result [214]
is

gravity. the legs correspond to factors of ki, and the cubic vertex to a factor of .
the position of the vertex is integrated over ads5.

in principle one could also have couplings of the form 123. this leads only to a
modication of the constant a1.

the main technical diculty with three-point functions is that one must gure out
the cubic couplings of supergravity elds. because of the diculties in writing down
a covariant action for type iib supergravity in ten dimensions (see however [260, 261,
262]), it is most straightforward to read o these cubic couplings from quadratic
terms in the equations of motion. in at ten-dimensional space these terms can be read
o directly from the original type iib supergravity papers [123, 263]. for ads5  s5,
one must instead expand in uctuations around the background metric and ve-form
eld strength. the old literature [124] only dealt with the linearized equations of
motion; for 3-point functions it is necessary to go to one higher order of perturbation
theory. this was done for a restricted set of elds in [229]. the elds considered
were those dual to operators of the form tr(j1j2 . . . j) in eld theory, where the
parentheses indicate a symmetrized traceless product. these operators are the chiral
primaries of the gauge theory: all other single trace operators of protected dimension
descend from these by commuting with supersymmetry generators. only the metric
and the ve-form are involved in the dual supergravity elds, and we are interested
only in modes which are scalars in ads5. the result of [229] is that the equations of
motion for the scalar modes si dual to

derivative couplings of the form sss are expected a priori to enter into (3.47),
but an appropriate eld redenition eliminates them. the notation in (3.46) and
(3.47) requires some explanation. i is an index which runs over the weight vectors
of all possible representations constructed as symmetric traceless products of the 6 of
su(4)r. these are the representations whose young diagrams are ,
j1...jcj j1...j = ij . as commented in

the previous section, there is generally a normalization ambiguity on how supergravity
elds couple to operators in the gauge theory. we have taken the coupling to be

r d4x sioi, and the normalization ambiguity is represented by the leg factors wi.
it is the combination si = wi si rather than si itself which has a denite relation
to supergravity elds. we refer the reader to [229] for explicit expressions for ai
and the symmetric tensor gi1i2i3. to get rid of factors of wi, we introduce operators
oi = wioi. one can choose wi so that a two-point function computation along the
lines of section 3.3.1 leads to

remarkably, (3.49) is the same result one obtains from free eld theory by wick con-
tracting all the j elds in the three operators. this suggests that there is a non-
renormalization theorem for this correlation function, but such a theorem has not yet
been proven. it is worth emphasizing that the normalization ambiguity in the bulk-
boundary coupling is circumvented essentially by considering invariant ratios of three-
point functions and two-point functions, into which the leg factors wi do not enter.
this is the same strategy as was pursued in comparing matrix models of quantum
gravity to liouville theory.

88

3.3.3 four-point functions

the calculation of four-point functions is dicult because there are several graphs
which contribute, and some of them inevitably involve bulk-to-bulk propagators of
elds with spin. the computation of four-point functions of the operators o and
oc dual to the dilaton and the axion was completed in [264]. see also [237, 241,
242, 243, 265, 266, 246, 244, 267] for earlier contributions. one of the main technical
results, further developed in [268], is that diagrams involving an internal propagator
can be reduced by integration over one of the bulk vertices to a sum of quartic graphs
expressible in terms of the functions

d1234(~x1, ~x2, ~x3, ~x4) =z d5xg

the integration is over the bulk point (~x, z). there are two independent conformally

an interesting limit of (3.53) is to take two pairs of points close together. following
[264], let us take the pairs (~x1, ~x3) and (~x2, ~x4) close together while holding ~x1 and ~x2
a xed distance apart. then the existence of an ope expansion implies that

for ~x13 and ~x24. the operators on are the ones that appear in the ope of o1 with o3,
and the operators om are the ones that appear in the ope of o2 with o4. o and oc
are descendants of chiral primaries, and so have protected dimensions. the product
of descendants of chiral elds is not itself necessarily the descendent of a chiral eld:
an appropriately normal ordered product : oo : is expected to have an unprotected

dimension of the form 8 + o(1/n 2). this is the natural result from the eld theory
point of view because there are o(n 2) degrees of freedom contributing to each factor,
and the commutation relations between them are non-trivial only a fraction 1/n 2 of
the time. from the supergravity point of view, a composite operator like : oo :
corresponds to a two-particle bulk state, and the o(1/n 2) = o(2/r8) correction to
the mass is interpreted as the correction to the mass of the two-particle state from
gravitational binding energy. roughly one is thinking of graviton exchange between
the legs of gure 3.4 that are nearly coincident.

if (3.54) is expanded in inverse powers of n, then the o(1/n 2) correction to n
and m shows up to leading order as a term proportional to a logarithm of some
combination of the separations ~xij. logarithms also appear in the expansion of (3.53)
in the |~x13|,|~x24|  |~x12| limit in which (3.54) applies: the leading log in this limit is
(~x12)16 log(cid:16) ~x13~x24
12 (cid:17). this is the correct form to be interpreted in terms of the propagation

of a two-particle state dual to an operator whose dimension is slightly dierent from 8.

3.4 isomorphism of hilbert spaces

the ads/cft correspondence is a statement about the equivalence of two quantum
theories: string theory (or m theory) on adsp+2  (compact space) and cftp+1. the
two quantum theories are equivalent if there is an isomorphism between their hilbert
spaces, and moreover if the operator algebras on the hilbert spaces are equivalent. in
this section, we discuss the isomorphism of the hilbert spaces, following [269, 182, 270,
271]. related issues have been discussed in [272, 273, 274, 275, 276, 277, 278, 279, 280].
states in the hilbert space of cftp+1 fall into representations of the global conformal
group so(2, p + 1) on rp,1. at the same time, the isometry group of ads is also
so(2, p + 1), and we can use it to classify states in the string theory. thus, it is

90

useful to compare states in the two theories by organizing them into representations
of so(2, p + 1). the conformal group so(2, p + 1) has 1
2(p + 2)(p + 3) generators,
jab = jba (a, b = 0, 1,   , p + 2), obeying the commutation relation

[jab, jcd] = i(gacjbd  permutations)

(3.55)
with the metric gab = diag(1, +1, +1,   , +1,1). in cftp+1, they are identied
with the poincare generators p and m, the dilatation d and the special conformal
generators k (,  = 0,   , p), by the formulas
(k + p), j,p+1 =

jp+2,p+1 = d, j,p+2 =

1
2

1
2

(k  p), j = m.

(3.56)

since the eld theory on rp,1 has no scale, the spectrum of the hamiltonian p0 is
continuous and there is no normalizable ground state with respect to p0. this is also
the case for the string theory on adsp+2. the killing vector t corresponding to p0
has the norm

(3.57)
and it vanishes as u  0. consequently, a stationary wave solution of the linearized
supergravity on ads has a continuous frequency spectrum with respect to the timelike
coordinate t. it is not easy to compare the spectrum of p0 of the two theories.

||t|| = ru,

it is more useful to compare the two hilbert spaces using the maximum compact
subgroup so(2)  so(p + 1) of the conformal group [269]. the minkowski space rp,1
is conformally embedded in the einstein universe r  sp, and so(2)  so(p + 1) is
its isometry group. in particular, the generator j0,p+2 = 1
2(p0 + k0) of so(2) is the
hamiltonian for the cft on r  sp. now we have a scale in the problem, which is
the radius of sp, and the hamiltonian 1
2(p0 + k0) has a mass gap. in string theory on
adsp+2, the generator 1
2(p0 + k0) corresponds to the global time translation along the
coordinate  . this is a globally well-dened coordinate on ads and the killing vector
 is everywhere non-vanishing:

|||| =

r

cos 

.

(3.58)

therefore, a stationary wave solution with respect to  is normalizable and has a
discrete frequency spectrum.
in fact, as we saw in section 2.2.4, the frequency is
quantized in such a way that bosonic elds in the supergravity multiplet are periodic
and their superpartners are anti-periodic (i.e. obeying the supersymmetry preserving
ramond boundary condition) in the  -direction with the period 2r.

3.4.1 hilbert space of string theory

with the techniques that are currently available, we can make reliable statements about
the hilbert space structure of string theory on ads only when the curvature radius r

91

of ads is much larger than the string length ls. in this section we will study some of
the properties of the hilbert space that we can see in the ads description. we will
concentrate on the ads5  s5 case, but it is easy to generalize this to other cases.

we rst consider the case that corresponds to the t hooft limit gs  0, gsn xed

and large, so that we can trust the gravity approximation.

(1) e  ms; gas of free gravitons

the hilbert space for low energies is well approximated by the fock space of gravitons
and their superpartners on ads5 s5. since  is a globally dened timelike coordinate
on ads, we can consider stationary wave solutions in the linearized supergravity, which
are the normalizable states discussed in section 2.2.2. the frequency  of a stationary
mode is quantized in the unit set by the curvature radius r (2.41), so one may eectively
view the supergravity particles in ads as conned in a box of size r.

the operator h = 1

2r (p0 + k0) corresponds9 to the killing vector  on ads. thus,
a single particle state of frequency  gives an eigenstate of h. since the supergraviton
is a bps particle, its energy eigenvalue  is exact, free from corrections either by
rst quantized string eects ( ls/r) or by quantum gravity eects ( lp /r). the
energy of multiparticle states may receive corrections, but they become important only
when the energy e becomes comparable to the gravitational potential e2/(m8
p r7), i.e.
e  m8

p r7. for the energies we are considering this eect is negligible.

therefore, the hilbert space for e  ms is identied with the fock space of free
supergravity particles. for e  r1, the entropy s(e) (= log n(e) where n(e) is
the density of states) behaves as

s(e)  (er)

9

10 ,

(3.59)

since we eectively have a gas in ten dimensions (we will ignore multiplicative numerical
factors in the entropy in this section).
(2) ms < e  ms/g2

s; gas of free strings

when the energy e becomes comparable to the string scale ms, we have to take
into account excitations on the string worldsheet. although we do not know the exact
rst quantized spectrum of string theory on ads, we can estimate the eects of the
worldsheet excitations when ls  r. the mass m of a rst quantized string state is a
function of ls and r. when ls  r, the worldsheet dynamics is perturbative and we
can expand m in powers of ls/r, with the leading term given by the string spectrum
on at space (r = ). therefore, for a string state corresponding to the n-th excited
1
2r in the relation between h and (p0 + k0) is xed by the commutation relations

9the factor

(3.55).

level of the string on at space, the (mass)2 is given by

m2 = l2

s (cid:16)n + o(l2

s/r2)(cid:17) .

(3.60)

unlike the single particle supergravity states discussed in the previous paragraph, string
excitations need not carry integral eigenvalues of h (in units of r1). as they are not
bps particles, they are generically unstable in string perturbation theory.

the free string spectrum in 10 dimensions gives the hagedorn density of states

thus, the entropy of supergravity particles (3.59) becomes comparable to that of ex-
cited strings (3.61) when

radius r+ becomes larger than the string length ls. furthermore, if the horizon size
r+ is smaller than r, the geometry near the black hole can be approximated by the

the above analysis assumes that the size of the black hole, characterized by the
horizon radius r+, is small compared to the radii r of ads5 and s5. as we increase
the energy, the radius r+ grows and eventually becomes comparable to r. beyond this
point, we can no longer use the 10-dimensional schwarzschild solution to estimate the
number of states. according to (3.64), the horizon size becomes comparable to r when
the energy of the black hole reaches the scale e  m8
p r7. beyond this energy scale,
we have to use a solution which is asymptotically ads5 [281],

the behavior of the entropy is depicted in gure 3.5.

in the small black hole regime (3), the system has a negative specic heat. this
corresponds to the well-known instability of the at space at nite temperature [283].
on the other hand, the ads schwarzschild solution has a positive specic heat and it
is thermodynamically stable. this means that, if we consider a canonical ensemble,
the free string regime (2) and the small black hole regime (3) will be missed. when
set in contact with a heat bath of temperature t  ms, the system will continue to
absorb heat until its energy reaches e  m8
p r7, the threshold of the large black hole
regime (4). in fact the jump from (1) to (4) takes place at much lower temperature
p r7 derived from (3.76) in the regime (4)
since the temperature equivalent of e  m8
is t  r1. therefore, once the temperature is raised to t  r1 a black hole forms.
the behavior of the canonical ensemble will be discussed in more detail in section 3.6.
finally let us notice that in the case that gs  1 we do not have the hagedorn phase,

and we go directly from the gas of gravitons to the small black hole phase.

3.4.2 hilbert space of conformal field theory

next, let us turn to a discussion of the hilbert space of the cftp+1. the generator
j0,p+2 = 1
2 (p0 + k0) is the hamiltonian of the cft on sp with the unit radius. in
the euclidean cft, the conformal group so(2, p + 1) turns into so(1, p + 2) by the
wick rotation, and the hamiltonian 1
2 (p0 + k0) and the dilatation operator d can
be rotated into each other by an internal isomorphism of the group. therefore, if
there is a conformal eld h(x) of dimension h with respect to the dilatation d, then
there is a corresponding eigenstate |hi of 1
2(p0 + k0) on sp with the same eigenvalue
h. in two-dimensional conformal eld theory, this phenomenon is well-known as the
state-operator correspondence, but in fact it holds for any cftp+1 :

h(x)  |hi = h(x = 0)|0i.

(3.77)

as discussed in section 3.2.1, in maximally supersymmetric cases there is a one-to-
one correspondence between chiral primary operators of cftp+1 and the supergravity
particles on the dual adsp+2  (compact space). this makes it possible to identify a
state in the fock space of the supergravity particles on ads with a state in the cft
hibert space generated by the chiral primary elds.

96

to be specic, let us consider the n = 4 su(n) super yang-mills theory in four
dimensions and its dual, type iib string theory on ads5  s5. the string scale ms and
the 10-dimensional planck scale mp are related to the gauge theory parameters, gy m

the four energy regimes of string theory on ads5  s5 are translated into the gauge
theory energy scales (measured in the units of the inverse s3 radius) in the t hooft
limit as follows:
(1) e  (g2

the hilbert space consists of the chiral primary states, their superconformal descen-
dants and their products. because of the large-n factorization, a product of gauge
invariant operators receives corrections only at subleading orders in the 1/n expan-
sion. this ts well with the supergravity description of multi-graviton states, where we
estimated that their energy e becomes comparable to the gravitational potential when
e  m8
p r7, which in the gauge theory scale corresponds to e  n 2. the entropy for

dimensions, although the precise numerical coecient in s diers from the one that
is obtained from the number of particles in the n = 4 yang-mills multiplet by a
numerical factor [284].

3.5 wilson loops

in this section we consider wilson loop operators in the gauge theory. the wilson loop
operator

w (c) = tr(cid:20)p exp(cid:18)iic

a(cid:19)(cid:21)

(3.83)

depends on a loop c embedded in four dimensional space, and it involves the path-
ordered integral of the gauge connection along the contour. the trace is taken over
some representation of the gauge group; we will discuss here only the case of the
fundamental representation (see [285] for a discussion of other representations). from
the expectation value of the wilson loop operator hw (c)i we can calculate the quark-
antiquark potential. for this purpose we consider a rectangular loop with sides of
length t and l in euclidean space. then, viewing t as the time direction, it is clear
that for large t the expectation value will behave as et e where e is the lowest possible
energy of the quark-anti-quark conguration. thus, we have

hwi  et v (l) ,

(3.84)

where v (l) is the quark anti-quark potential. for large n and large g2
y m n, the
ads/cft correspondence maps the computation of hwi in the cft into a problem
of nding a minimum surface in ads [286, 287].

3.5.1 wilson loops and minimum surfaces

in qcd, we expect the wilson loop to be related to the string running from the quark to
the antiquark. we expect this string to be analogous to the string in our conguration,
which is a superstring which lives in ten dimensions, and which can stretch between
two points on the boundary of ads.
in order to motivate this prescription let us
consider the following situation. we start with the gauge group u(n + 1), and we
break it to u(n)  u(1) by giving an expectation value to one of the scalars. this
corresponds, as discussed in section 3.1, to having a d3 brane sitting at some radial
position u in ads, and at a point on s5. the o-diagonal states, transforming in the
n of u(n), get a mass proportional to u, m = u/2. so, from the point of view of

98

the u(n) gauge theory, we can view these states as massive quarks, which act as a
source for the various u(n) elds. since they are charged they will act as a source for
the vector elds. in order to get a non-dynamical source (an external quark with no
uctuations of its own, which will correspond precisely to the wilson loop operator)
we need to take m  , which means u should also go to innity. thus, the string
should end on the boundary of ads space.

these stretched strings will also act as a source for the scalar elds. the coupling to
the scalar elds can be seen qualitatively by viewing the quarks as strings stretching
between the n branes and the single separated brane. these strings will pull the n
branes and will cause a deformation of the branes, which is described by the scalar
elds. a more formal argument for this coupling is that these states are bps, and
the coupling to the scalar (higgs) elds is determined by supersymmetry. finally, one
can see this coupling explicitly by writing the full u(n + 1) lagrangian, putting in
the higgs expectation value and calculating the equation of motion for the massive
elds [286]. the precise denition of the wilson loop operator corresponding to the
superstring will actually include also the eld theory fermions, which will imply some
particular boundary conditions for the worldsheet fermions at the boundary of ads.
however, this will not aect the leading order computations we describe here.
so, the nal conclusion is that the stretched strings couple to the operator

w (c) = tr(cid:20)p exp(cid:18)i (ia x + ii x2)d(cid:19)(cid:21) ,

(3.85)

where x( ) is any parametrization of the loop and i (i = 1,   , 6) is a unit vector in
r6 (the point on s5 where the string is sitting). this is the expression when the signa-
ture of r4 is euclidean. in the minkowski signature case, the phase factor associated
to the trajectory of the quark has an extra factor i in front of i 10.

generalizing the prescription of section 3.3 for computing correlation functions, the
discussion above implies that in order to compute the expectation value of the operator
(3.85) in n = 4 sym we should consider the string theory partition function on
ads5  s5, with the condition that we have a string worldsheet ending on the loop c,
as in gure 3.6 [287, 286]. in the supergravity regime, when gsn is large, the leading
contribution to this partition function will come from the area of the string worldsheet.
this area is measured with the ads metric, and it is generally not the same as the
area enclosed by the loop c in four dimensions.

the area as dened above is divergent. the divergence arises from the fact that
if we evaluate
the string worldsheet is going all the way to the boundary of ads.
the area up to some radial distance u = r, we see that for large r it diverges as

10the dierence in the factor of i between the euclidean and the minkowski cases can be traced to
the analytic continuation of  x2. a detailed derivation of (3.85) can be found in [288].

figure 3.6: the wilson loop operator creates a string worldsheet ending on the corre-
sponding loop on the boundary of ads.

r|c|, where |c| is the length of the loop in the eld theory [286, 287]. on the other
hand, the perturbative computation in the eld theory shows that hwi, for w given
by (3.85), is nite, as it should be since a divergence in the wilson loop would have
implied a mass renormalization of the bps particle. the apparent discrepancy between
the divergence of the area of the minimum surface in ads and the niteness of the
eld theory computation can be reconciled by noting that the appropriate action for
the string worldsheet is not the area itself but its legendre transform with respect to
the string coordinates corresponding to i and the radial coordinate u [288]. this is
because these string coordinates obey the neumann boundary conditions rather than
the dirichlet conditions. when the loop is smooth, the legendre transformation simply
subtracts the divergent term r|c|, leaving the resulting action nite.

as an example let us consider a circular wilson loop. take c to be a circle of radius
a on the boundary, and let us work in the poincare coordinates (dened in section
2.2). we could nd the surface that minimizes the area by solving the euler-lagrange
equations. however, in this case it is easier to use conformal invariance. note that
there is a conformal transformation in the eld theory that maps a line to a circle. in
the case of the line, the minimum area surface is clearly a plane that intersects the
boundary and goes all the way to the horizon (which is just a point on the boundary
in the euclidean case). using the conformal transformation to map the line to a circle
we obtain the minimal surface we want. it is, using the coordinates (3.17) for ads5,

~x = a2  z2(~e1 cos  + ~e2 sin ),

(3.86)

where ~e1, ~e2 are two orthonormal vectors in four dimensions (which dene the orien-
tation of the circle) and 0  z  a. we can calculate the area of this surface in ads,
and we get a contribution to the action

where we have regularized the area by putting a an ir cuto at z =  in ads, which
is equivalent to a uv cuto in the eld theory [172]. subtracting the divergent term
we get

hwi  es  er2/

4gsn .

= e

(3.88)

this is independent of a as required by conformal invariance.

we could similarly consider a magnetic wilson loop, which is also called a t hooft
loop [289]. this case is related by electric-magnetic duality to the previous case. since
we identify the electric-magnetic duality with the sl(2, z) duality of type iib string
theory, we should consider in this case a d-string worldsheet instead of a fundamental
string worldsheet. we get the same result as in (3.88) but with gs  1/gs.

using (3.84) it is possible to compute the quark-antiquark potential in the supergrav-
ity approximation [287, 286]. in this case we consider a conguration which is invariant
under (euclidean) time translations. we take both particles to have the same scalar
charge, which means that the two ends of the string are at the same point in s5 (one
could consider also the more general case with a string ending at dierent points on s5
[286]). we put the quark at x = l/2 and the anti-quark at x = l/2. here quark
means an innitely massive w-boson connecting the n branes with one brane which
is (innitely) far away. the classical action for a string worldsheet is

s =

1

2z d dqdet(gm n x m x n ),

(3.89)

where gm n is the euclidean ads5  s5 metric. note that the factors of  cancel
out in (3.89), as they should. since we are interested in a static conguration we take
 = t,  = x, and then the action becomes

dxq(xz)2 + 1

we need to solve the euler-lagrange equations for this action. since the action does
not depend on x explicitly the solution satises

1

z2q(xz)2 + 1

= constant.

(3.91)

dening z0 to be the maximum value of z(x), which by symmetry occurs at x = 0, we
nd that the solution is11

quickly approaches x = l/2 for small z (close to the boundary),

z  0 .

(3.94)

now we compute the total energy of the conguration. we just plug in the solution
(3.92) in (3.90), subtract the innity as explained above (which can be interpreted as
the energy of two separated massive quarks, as in gure 3.7(a)), and we nd

e = v (l) = 

42(2g2
( 1

y m n)1/2
4)4l

.

(3.95)

we see that the energy goes as 1/l, a fact which is determined by conformal invariance.
note that the energy is proportional to (g2
y m n which is the
perturbative result. this indicates some screening of the charges at strong coupling.
the above calculation makes sense for all distances l when gsn is large, independently
of the value of gs. some subleading corrections coming from quantum uctuations of
the worldsheet were calculated in [290, 291, 292].

y m n)1/2, as opposed to g2

in a similar fashion we could compute the potential between two magnetic monopoles
in terms of a d-string worldsheet, and the result will be the same as (3.95) but with
gy m  4/gy m . one can also calculate the interaction between a magnetic monopole
and a quark. in this case the fundamental string (ending on the quark) will attach to
the d-string (ending on the monopole), and they will connect to form a (1, 1) string
which will go into the horizon. the resulting potential is a complicated function of
gy m [293], but in the limit that gy m is small (but still with g2
y m n large) we get
that the monopole-quark potential is just 1/4 of the quark-quark potential. this can
be understood from the fact that when g is small the d-string is very rigid and the
fundamental string will end almost perpendicularly on the d-string. therefore, the
solution for the fundamental string will be half of the solution we had above, leading
to a factor of 1/4 in the potential. calculations of wilson loops in the higgs phase
were done in [294].

another interesting case one can study analytically is a surface near a cusp on r4.
in this case, the perturbative computation in the gauge theory shows a logarithmic
divergence with a coecient depending on the angle at the cusp. the area of the
minimum surface also contains a logarithmic divergence depending on the angle [288].
other aspects of the gravity calculation of wilson loops were discussed in [295, 296,
297, 298].

quark-antiquark energy is given by the dierence of the total length of the strings in
(a) and (b).

3.5.2 other branes ending on the boundary

we could also consider other branes that are ending at the boundary [299]. the
simplest example would be a zero-brane (i.e. a particle) of mass m.
in euclidean
space a zero-brane describes a one dimensional trajectory in anti-de-sitter space which
ends at two points on the boundary. therefore, it is associated with the insertion of
two local operators at the two points where the trajectory ends. in the supergravity
approximation the zero-brane follows a geodesic. geodesics in the hyperbolic plane
(euclidean ads) are semicircles. if we compute the action we get

s = mz ds = 2mrz a



,

(3.96)

adz

za2  z2

where we took the distance between the two points at the boundary to be l = 2a and
regulated the result. we nd a logarithmic divergence when   0, proportional to
log(/a). if we subtract the logarithmic divergence we get a residual dependence on a.
naively we might have thought that (as in the previous subsection) the answer had to
be independent of a due to conformal invariance. in fact, the dependence on a is very
important, since it leads to a result of the form

which is precisely the result we expect for the two-point function of an operator of
dimension  = mr. this is precisely the large mr limit of the formula (3.14), so
we reproduce in the supergravity limit the 2-point function described in section 3.3.
in general, this sort of logarithmic divergence arises when the brane worldvolume is
odd dimensional [299], and it implies that the expectation value of the corresponding
operator depends on the overall scale. in particular one could consider the wilson
surfaces that arise in the six dimensional n = (2, 0) theory which will be discussed in
section 6.1.1. in that case one has to consider a two-brane, with a three dimensional
worldvolume, ending on a two dimensional surface on the boundary of ads7. again,
one gets a logarithmic term, which is proportional to the rigid string action of the two
dimensional surface living on the string in the n = (2, 0) eld theory [300, 299].

one can also compute correlation functions involving more than one wilson loop.
to leading order in n this will be just the product of the expectation values of each
wilson loop. on general grounds one expects that the subleading corrections are given
by surfaces that end on more than one loop. one limiting case is when the surfaces look
similar to the zeroth order surfaces but with additional thin tubes connecting them.
these thin tubes are nothing else than massless particles being exchanged between the
two string worldsheets [285, 300]. we will discuss this further in section 6.2.

3.6 theories at finite temperature

as discussed in section 3.2, the quantities that can be most successfully compared
between gauge theory and string theory are those with some protection from super-
symmetry and/or conformal invariance  for instance, dimensions of chiral primary
operators. finite temperature breaks both supersymmetry and conformal invariance,
and the insights we gain from examining the t > 0 physics will be of a more qualita-
tive nature. they are no less interesting for that: we shall see in section 3.6.1 how the
entropy of near-extremal d3-branes comes out identical to the free eld theory pre-
diction up to a factor of a power of 4/3; then in section 3.6.2 we explain how a phase
transition studied by hawking and page in the context of quantum gravity is mapped
into a connement-deconnement transition in the gauge theory, driven by nite-size
eects; and in section 6.2 we will summarize the attempts to use holographic duals of
nite-temperature eld theories to learn about pure gauge theory at zero temperature
but in one lower dimension.

3.6.1 construction

the gravity solution describing the gauge theory at nite temperature can be obtained
by starting from the general black three-brane solution (1.12) and taking the decoupling

104

it will often be useful to wick rotate by setting te = it, and use the relation between
the nite temperature theory and the euclidean theory with a compact time direction.
the rst computation which indicated that nite-temperature u(n) yang-mills the-
ory might be a good description of the microstates of n coincident d3-branes was the
calculation of the entropy [284, 301]. on the supergravity side, the entropy of near-
extremal d3-branes is just the usual bekenstein-hawking result, s = a/4gn , and it
is expected to be a reliable guide to the entropy of the gauge theory at large n and
large g2
y m n. there is no problem on the gauge theory side in working at large n,
but large g2
y m n at nite temperature is dicult indeed. the analysis of [284] was
limited to a free eld computation in the eld theory, but nevertheless the two results
for the entropy agreed up to a factor of a power of 4/3. in the canonical ensemble,
where temperature and volume are the independent variables, one identies the eld
theory volume with the world-volume of the d3-branes, and one sets the eld theory
temperature equal to the hawking temperature in supergravity. the result is

(3.99)

fsu gra =

fsy m =

fsu gra .

the supergravity result is at leading order in ls/r, and it would acquire corrections
suppressed by powers of t r if we had considered the full d3-brane metric rather than
the near-horizon limit, (3.98). these corrections do not have an interpretation in the
context of cft because they involve r as an intrinsic scale. two equivalent methods
to evaluate fsu gra are a) to use f = e  t s together with standard expressions for
the bekenstein-hawking entropy, the hawking temperature, and the adm mass; and
b) to consider the gravitational action of the euclidean solution, with a periodicity in
the euclidean time direction (related to the temperature) which eliminates a conical
decit angle at the horizon.12

the 4/3 factor is a long-standing puzzle into which we still have only qualitative in-
sight. the gauge theory computation was performed at zero t hooft coupling, whereas

12the result of [284], ssy m = (4/3)1/4ssugra, diers supercially from (3.99), but it is only
because the authors worked in the microcanonical ensemble: rather than identifying the hawking
temperature with the eld theory temperature, the adm mass above extremality was identied with
the eld theory energy.

105

the supergravity is supposed to be valid at strong t hooft coupling, and unlike in the
1+1-dimensional case where the entropy is essentially xed by the central charge, there
is no non-renormalization theorem for the coecient of t 4 in the free energy. indeed,
it was suggested in [282] that the leading term in the 1/n expansion of f has the form

f = f (g2

y m n)

2
6

n 2v t 4,

(3.100)

where f (g2
y m n) is a function which smoothly interpolates between a weak coupling
limit of 1 and a strong coupling limit of 3/4. it was pointed out early [302] that the
quartic potential g2
y m tr[i, j]2 in the n = 4 yang-mills action might be expected
to freeze out more and more degrees of freedom as the coupling was increased, which
would suggest that f (g2
y m n) is monotone decreasing. an argument has been given
[303], based on the non-renormalization of the two-point function of the stress tensor,
that f (g2

y m n) should remain nite at strong coupling.

the leading corrections to the limiting value of f (g2

y m n) at strong and weak coupling

were computed in [282] and [304], respectively. the results are

f (g2

(3.101)

the weak coupling result is a straightforward although somewhat tedious application
of the diagrammatic methods of perturbative nite-temperature eld theory. the
constant term is from one loop, and the leading correction is from two loops. the strong
coupling result follows from considering the leading  corrections to the supergravity
action. the relevant one involves a particular contraction of four powers of the weyl
tensor.
it is important now to work with the euclidean solution, and one restricts
attention further to the near-horizon limit. the weyl curvature comes from the non-
compact part of the metric, which is no longer ads5 but rather the ads-schwarzschild
solution which we will discuss in more detail in section 3.6.2. the action including
the  corrections no longer has the einstein-hilbert form, and correspondingly the
bekenstein-hawking prescription no longer agrees with the free energy computed as i
where i is the euclidean action. in keeping with the basic prescription for computing
greens functions, where a free energy in eld theory is equated (in the appropriate
limit) with a supergravity action, the relation i = f is regarded as the correct
one. (see [305].) it has been conjectured that the interpolating function f (g2
y m n)
is not smooth, but exhibits some phase transition at a nite value of the t hooft
coupling. we regard this as an unsettled question. the arguments in [306, 307] seem
as yet incomplete. in particular, they rely on analyticity properties of the perturbation
expansion which do not seem to be proven for nite temperature eld theories.

106

3.6.2 thermal phase transition

the holographic prescription of [18, 19], applied at large n and g2
y m n where loop and
stringy corrections are negligible, involves extremizing the supergravity action subject
to particular asymptotic boundary conditions. we can think of this as the saddle point
approximation to the path integral over supergravity elds. that path integral is ill-
dened because of the non-renormalizable nature of supergravity. string amplitudes
(when we can calculate them) render on-shell quantities well-dened. despite the con-
ceptual diculties we can use some simple intuition about path integrals to illustrate
an important point about the ads/cft correspondence: namely, there can be more
than one saddle point in the range of integration, and when there is we should sum
eisu gra over the classical congurations to obtain the saddle-point approximation to
the gauge theory partition function. multiple classical congurations are possible be-
cause of the general feature of boundary value problems in dierential equations: there
can be multiple solutions to the classical equations satisfying the same asymptotic
boundary conditions. the solution which globally minimizes isu gra is the one that
dominates the path integral.

when there are two or more solutions competing to minimize isu gra, there can
be a phase transition between them. an example of this was studied in [281] long
before the ads/cft correspondence, and subsequently resurrected, generalized, and
reinterpreted in [19, 182] as a connement-deconnement transition in the gauge theory.
since the qualitative features are independent of the dimension, we will restrict our
attention to ads5. it is worth noting however that if the ads5 geometry is part of a
string compactication, it doesnt matter what the internal manifold is except insofar
as it xes the cosmological constant, or equivalently the radius r of anti-de sitter
space.

there is an embedding of the schwarzschild black hole solution into anti-de sitter

space which extremizes the action

the radial variable r is restricted to r  r+, where r+ is the largest root of f = 0. the

(3.104)

topologically, this space is s3  b2, and the boundary is s3  s1 (which is the relevant
space for the eld theory on s3 with nite temperature). we will call this space x2.
another space with the same boundary which is also a local extremum of (3.102) is
given by the metric in (3.103) with  = 0 and again with periodic time. this space,
which we will call x1, is not only metrically distinct from the rst (being locally con-
formally at), but also topologically b4  s1 rather than s3  b2. because the s1
factor is not simply connected, there are two possible spin structures on x1, corre-
sponding to thermal (anti-periodic) or supersymmetric (periodic) boundary conditions
on fermions.
in contrast, x2 is simply connected and hence admits a unique spin
structure, corresponding to thermal boundary conditions. for the purpose of comput-
ing the twisted partition function, tr(1)f eh, in a saddle-point approximation, only
x1 contributes. but, x1 and x2 make separate saddle-point contributions to the usual
thermal partition function, treh , and the more important one is the one with the
smaller euclidean action.

actually, both i(x1) and i(x2) are innite, so to compute i(x2)i(x1) a regulation
scheme must be adopted. the one used in [182, 282] is to cut o both x1 and x2 at a
denite coordinate radius r = r0. for x2, the elimination of the conical decit angle
at the horizon xes the period of euclidean time; but for x1, the period is arbitrary.
in order to make the comparison of i(x1) and i(x2) meaningful, we x the period of
euclidean time on x1 so that the proper circumference of the s1 at r = r0 is the same
as the proper length on x2 of an orbit of the killing vector /t, also at r = r0. in
the limit r0  , one nds

where again r+ is the largest root of f = 0. the fact that (3.105) (or more precisely
its ads4 analog) can change its sign was interpreted in [281] as indicating a phase
transition between a black hole in ads and a thermal gas of particles in ads (which
is the natural interpretation of the space x1). the black hole is the thermodynam-
ically favored state when the horizon radius r+ exceeds the radius of curvature r of
ads. in the gauge theory we interpret this transition as a connement-deconnement
transition. since the theory is conformally invariant, the transition temperature must
be proportional to the inverse radius of the space s3 which the eld theory lives on.
similar transitions, and also local thermodynamic instability due to negative specic
heats, have been studied in the context of spinning branes and charged black holes

108

in [308, 309, 310, 140, 139, 311, 312]. most of these works are best understood on
the cft side as explorations of exotic thermal phenomena in nite-temperature gauge
theories. connections with higgsed states in gauge theory are clearer in [313, 314].
the relevance to connement is explored in [311]. see also [315, 316, 317, 277] for
other interesting contributions to the nite temperature literature.

deconnement at high temperature can be characterized by a spontaneous breaking
of the center of the gauge group. in our case the gauge group is su(n) and its center
is zn . the order parameter for the breaking of the center is the expectation value of
the polyakov (temporal) loop hw (c)i. the boundary of the spaces x1, x2 is s3  s1,
and the path c wraps around the circle. an element of the center g  zn acts on the
polyakov loop by hw (c)i  ghw (c)i. the expectation value of the polyakov loop
measures the change of the free energy of the system fq(t ) induced by the presence
of the external charge q, hw (c)i  exp (fq(t )/t ). in a conning phase fq(t ) is
innite and therefore hw (c)i = 0. in the deconned phase fq(t ) is nite and therefore
hw (c)i 6= 0.

as discussed in section 3.5, in order to compute hw (c)i we have to evaluate the
partition function of strings with a worldsheet d that is bounded by the loop c. the
details of a similar computation will be discussed in the next section. they will not be
needed in this section. consider rst the low temperature phase. the relevant space
is x1 which, as discussed above, has the topology b4  s1. the contour c wraps the
circle and is not homotopic to zero in x1. therefore c is not a boundary of any d,
which immediately implies that hw (c)i = 0. this is the expected behavior at low
temperatures (compared to the inverse radius of the s3), where the center of the gauge
group is not broken.

for the high temperature phase the relevant space is x2, which has the topology
s3  b2. the contour c is now a boundary of a string worldsheet d = b2 (times a
point in s3). this seems to be in agreement with the fact that in the high temperature
phase hw (c)i 6= 0 and the center of the gauge group is broken. it was pointed out
in [182] that there is a subtlety with this argument, since the center should not be
broken in nite volume (s3), but only in the innite volume limit (r3). indeed, the
solution x2 is not unique and we can add to it an expectation value for the integral
of the ns-ns 2-form eld b on b2, with vanishing eld strength. this is an angular
parameter  with period 2, which contributes i to the string worldsheet action. the
string theory partition function includes now an integral over all values of , making
hw (c)i = 0 on s3. in contrast, on r4 one integrates over the local uctuations of
 but not over its vacuum expectation value. now hw (c)i 6= 0 and depends on the
value of   u(1), which may be understood as the dependence on the center zn in
the large n limit.

in [182] the euclidean black hole solution (3.103) was suggested to be holographically

109

dual to a theory related to pure qcd in three dimensions. in the large volume limit
the solution corresponds to the n = 4 gauge theory on r3 s1 with thermal boundary
conditions, and when the s1 is made small (corresponding to high temperature t ) the
theory at distances larger than 1/t eectively reduces to pure yang-mills on r3. some
of the non-trivial successes of this approach to qcd will be discussed in section 6.2.

more on the correspondence

4.1 other ads5 backgrounds

up to now we have limited our discussion to the ads5  s5 background of type iib
string theory; in section 4.3 we will describe backgrounds which are related to it by
deformations. however, it is clear from the description of the correspondence in sections
3.1 and 3.3 that a similar correspondence may be dened for any theory of quantum
gravity whose metric includes an ads5 factor; the generalization of equation (3.13)
relates such a theory to a four dimensional conformal eld theory. the background
does not necessarily have to be of the form ads5  x; it is enough that it has an
so(4, 2) isometry symmetry, and more general possibilities in which the curvature of
ads5 depends on the position in x are also possible [119]. it is necessary, however,
for the ads theory to be a theory of quantum gravity, since any conformal theory
has an energy-momentum tensor operator that is mapped by the correspondence to
1. thus, we would like to discuss compactications of string
the graviton on ads5
theory or m theory, which are believed to be consistent theories of quantum gravity,
on backgrounds involving ads5. for simplicity we will only discuss here backgrounds
which are direct products of the form ads5  x.

given such a background of string/m theory, it is not apriori clear what is the
conformal eld theory to which it corresponds. a special class of backgrounds are
those which arise as near-horizon limits of branes, like the ads5  s5 background.
in this case one can sometimes analyze the low-energy eld theory on the branes by
standard methods before taking the near-horizon limit, and after the limit this becomes
the dual conformal eld theory. the most well-studied case is the case of d3-branes
in type iib string theory. when the d3-branes are at a generic point in space-time

1if we have a topological eld theory on the boundary the bulk theory does not have to be gravi-

tational, as in [318].

111

the near-horizon limit gives the ads5  s5 background discussed extensively above.
however, if the transverse space to the d3-branes is singular, the near-horizon limit
and the corresponding eld theory can be dierent. the simplest case is the case of a
d3-brane on an orbifold [319] or orientifold [211] singularity, which can be analyzed by
perturbative string theory methods. these cases will be discussed in sections 4.1.1 and
4.1.2. another interesting case is the conifold singularity [212] and its generalizations,
which will be discussed in section 4.1.3. in this case a direct analysis of the eld theory
is not possible, but various indirect arguments can be used to determine what it is in
many cases.

not much is known about more general cases of near-horizon limits of d3-branes,
which on the string theory side were analyzed in [320, 321, 322, 323, 324], and even
less is known about backgrounds which are not describable as near-horizon limits of
branes (several ads5 backgrounds were discussed in [325]). an example of the latter
is the ads5  cp3 background of m theory [326], which involves a 4-form ux on the
4-cycle in cp3. using the methods described in the previous sections we can compute
various properties of such compactications in the large n limit, such as the mass
spectrum and the central charge of the corresponding eld theories (for the ads5cp3
compactication one nds a central charge proportional to n 3, where n is the 4-form
ux). however, it is not known how to construct an alternative description of the
conformal eld theory in most of these cases, except for the cases which are related by
deformations to the better-understood orbifold and conifold compactications.

some of the ads5  x backgrounds of string/m theory preserve some number of
supersymmetries, but most of them (such as the ads5  cp3 background) do not.
in supersymmetric cases, supersymmetry guarantees the stability of the corresponding
solutions. in the non-supersymmetric cases various instabilities may arise for nite n
(see, for instance, [327, 328]) which may destroy the conformal (so(4, 2)) invariance,
but the correspondence is still conjectured to be valid when all quantum corrections
are taken into account (or in the innite n limit for which the supergravity approxima-
tion is valid). one type of instability occurs when the spectrum includes a tachyonic
eld whose mass is below the breitenlohner-freedman stability bound. such a eld is
expected to condense just like a tachyon in at space, and generally it is not known
what this condensation leads to. if the classical supergravity spectrum includes a eld
which saturates the stability bound, an analysis of the quantum corrections is neces-
sary to determine whether they raise the mass squared of the eld (leading to a stable
solution) or lower it (leading to an unstable solution). apriori one would not expect
to have a eld which exactly saturates the bound (corresponding to an operator in
the eld theory whose dimension is exactly  = 2) in a non-supersymmetric theory,
but this often happens in orbifold theories for reasons that will be discussed below.
another possible instability arises when there is a massless eld in the background,

112

corresponding to a marginal operator in the eld theory. such a eld (the dilaton)
exists in all classical type iib compactications, and naively corresponds to an exactly
marginal deformation of the theory even in the non-supersymmetric cases. however,
for nite n one would expect quantum corrections to generate a potential for such a
eld (if it is neutral under the gauge symmetries), which could drive its expectation
value away from the range of values where the supergravity approximation is valid.
again, an analysis of the quantum corrections is necessary in such a case to determine
if the theory has a stable vacuum (which may or may not be describable in supergrav-
ity), corresponding to a xed point of the corresponding eld theory, or if the potential
leads to a runaway behavior with no stable vacuum. another possible source of insta-
bilities is related to the possibility of forming brane-anti-brane pairs in the vacuum (or,
equivalently, the emission of branes which destabilize the vacuum) [329, 330, 331, 332];
one would expect such an instability to arise, for example, in cases where we look at
the near-horizon limit of n 3-branes which have a repulsive force between them. for
all these reasons, the study of non-supersymmetric backgrounds usually requires an
understanding of the quantum corrections, which are not yet well-understood neither
in m theory nor in type iib compactications with rr backgrounds. thus, we will fo-
cus here on supersymmetric backgrounds, for which the supergravity approximation is
generally valid. in the non-supersymmetric cases the correspondence is still expected to
be valid, and in the extreme large n limit it can also be studied using supergravity, but
getting nite n information usually requires going beyond the sugra approximation.
it would be very interesting to understand better the quantum corrections in order to
study non-supersymmetric theories at nite n using the ads/cft correspondence.

4.1.1 orbifolds of ads5  s5

the low-energy eld theory corresponding to d3-branes at orbifold singularities may be
derived by string theory methods [333, 334]. generally the gauge group is of the form

qi u(ain), and there are various bifundamental (and sometimes also adjoint) matter
elds2. we are interested in the near-horizon limit of d3-branes sitting at the origin of
r4 r6/ for some nite group  which is a discrete subgroup of the so(6)  su(4)r
rotation symmetry [319]. if   su(3)  su(4)r the theory on the d3-branes has
n = 1 supersymmetry, and if   su(2)  su(4)r it has n = 2 supersymmetry. the
near-horizon limit of such a conguration is of the form ads5s5/ (since the orbifold
commutes with taking the near-horizon limit), and corresponds (at least for large n)

2in general one can choose to have the orbifold group act on the chan-paton indices in various
ways. we will discuss here only the case where the group acts as n copies of the regular representation
of the orbifold group , which is the only case which leads to conformal theories. other representations
involve also 5-branes wrapped around 2-cycles, so they do not arise in the naive near-horizon limit of
d3-branes. the ads5 description of this was given in [213].

113

to a conformal theory with the appropriate amount of supersymmetry. note that on
neither side of the correspondence is the orbifolding just a projection on the -invariant
states of the original theory  on the string theory side we need to add also twisted
sectors, while on the eld theory side the gauge group is generally much larger (though
the eld theory can be viewed as a projection of the gauge theory corresponding to
dim()  n d-branes).

we will start with a general analysis of the orbifold, and then discuss specic ex-
amples with dierent amounts of supersymmetry3. the action of  on the s5 is the
same as its action on the angular coordinates of r6. if the original action of  had
only the origin as its xed point, the space s5/ is smooth. on the other hand, if the
original action had a space of xed points, some xed points remain, and the space
s5/ includes orbifold singularities. in this case the space is not geometrically smooth,
and the supergravity approximation is not valid (though of course in string theory it is
a standard orbifold compactication which is generically not singular). the spectrum
of string theory on ads5  s5/ includes states from untwisted and twisted sectors of
the orbifold. the untwisted states are just the -projection of the original states of
ads5  s5, and they include in particular the -invariant supergravity states. these
states have (in the classical supergravity limit) the same masses as in the original
ads5  s5 background [336], corresponding to integer dimensions in the eld theory,
which is why we often nd in orbifolds operators of dimension 2 or 4 which can desta-
bilize non-supersymmetric backgrounds. if the orbifold group has xed points on the
s5, there are also light twisted sector states that are localized near these xed points,
which need to be added to the supergravity elds for a proper description of the low-
energy dynamics. on the other hand, if the orbifold has no xed points, all twisted
sector states are heavy4, since they involve strings stretching between identied points
on the s5. in this case the twisted sector states decouple from the low-energy theory
in space-time (for large gsn). there is a global  symmetry in the corresponding eld
theory, under which the untwisted sector states are neutral while the twisted sector
states are charged.

in the t hooft limit of n   with gsn nite, all the solutions of the form
ads5  s5/ have a xed line corresponding to the dilaton, indicating that the beta
function of the corresponding eld theories vanishes in this limit [319]. in fact, one
can prove [337, 338, 339] (see also [340, 341]) that in this limit, which corresponds to
keeping only the planar diagrams in the eld theory, all the correlation functions of the
untwisted sector operators in the orbifold theories are the same (up to multiplication

states localized at the origin.

by some power of dim()) as in the n = 4 sym theory corresponding to ads5  s5 5.
this is the analog of the usual string theory statement that at tree-level the interactions
of untwisted sector states are exactly inherited from those of the original theory before
the orbifolding. for example, the central charge of the eld theory (appearing in the
2-point function of the energy-momentum tensor) is (in this limit) just dim() times
the central charge of the corresponding n = 4 theory. this may easily be seen also
on the string theory side, where the central charge may be shown [170] to be inversely
proportional to the volume of the compact space (and vol(s5/) = vol(s5)/dim()).
the vanishing of the beta function in the t hooft limit follows from this general
result (as predicted by the ads/cft correspondence). this applies both to orbifolds
which preserve supersymmetry and to those which do not, and leads to many examples
of supersymmetric and non-supersymmetric theories which have xed lines in the large
n limit. at subleading orders in 1/n, the correlation functions dier between the
orbifold theory and the n = 4 theory, and in principle a non-zero beta function
in supersymmetric orbifolds supersymmetry prevents this6, but in non-
may arise.
supersymmetric theories generically there will no longer be a xed line for nite n.
the dilaton potential is then related to the appearance of a non-zero beta function in
the eld theory, and the minima of this potential are related to the zeros of the eld
theory beta function for nite n.

as a rst example we can analyze the case [319] of d3-branes on an r4/zk orb-
ifold singularity, which preserves n = 2 supersymmetry. before taking the near-
horizon limit, the low-energy eld theory (at the free orbifold point in the string the-
ory moduli space) is a u(n)k gauge theory with bifundamental hypermultiplets in the
(n, n, 1,   , 1) + (1, n, n, 1,   , 1) +    + (1,   , 1, n, n) + ( n, 1,   , 1, n) repre-
sentation. the bare gauge couplings i of all the u(n) theories are equal to the string
coupling iib at this point in the moduli space. in the near-horizon (low-energy) limit
this eld theory becomes the su(n)k eld theory with the same matter content, since
the o-diagonal u(1) factors are ir-free7 (and the diagonal u(1) factor is decoupled
here and in all other examples in this section so we will ignore it). this theory is dual
to type iib string theory on ads5  s5/zk, where the zk action leaves xed an s1
inside the s5.

this eld theory is known (see, for instance, [342]) to be a nite eld theory for any
value of the k gauge couplings i, corresponding to a k-complex-dimensional surface
of conformal eld theories. thus, we should see k complex parameters in the string

5there is no similar relation for the twisted sector operators.
6at least, it prevents a potential for the dilaton, so there is still some xed line in the eld theory,

though it can be shifted from the n = 4 xed line when 1/n corrections are taken into account.
7this does not contradict our previous statements about the beta functions since the u (1) factors
are subleading in the 1/n expansion, and the operators corresponding to the o-diagonal u (1)s come
from twisted sectors.

theory background which we can change without destroying the ads5 component of
this background. one such parameter is obviously the dilaton, and the other (k  1)
may be identied [319] with the values of the ns-ns and r-r 2-form b-elds on the
(k  1) 2-cycles which vanish at the zk orbifold singularity (these are part of the blow-
up modes for the singularities; the other blow-up modes turn on elds which change the
ads5 background, and correspond to non-marginal deformations of the eld theory).
the low-energy spectrum has contributions both from the untwisted and from the
twisted sectors. the untwisted sector states are just the zk projection of the original
ads5  s5 states. the twisted sector states are the same (for large n and at low
energies) as those which appear in at space at an r4/zk singularity, except that here
they live on the xed locus of the zk action which is of the form ads5  s1. at the
orbifold point the massless twisted sector states are (k  1) tensor multiplets (these
tensor multiplets include scalars corresponding to the 2-form b-elds described above).
upon dimensional reduction on the s1 these give rise to (k  1) u(1) gauge elds on
ads5, which correspond to the u(1) global symmetries of the eld theory (which were
the o-diagonal gauge u(1)s before taking the near-horizon limit, and become global
symmetries after this limit); see, e.g. [343]. the orbifold point corresponds to having
all the b-elds maximally turned on [344]. the spectrum of elds on ads5 in this
background was successfully compared [345] to the spectrum of chiral operators in the
eld theory. if we move in the string theory moduli space to a point where the b-
elds on some 2-cycles are turned o, the d3-branes wrapped around these 2-cycles
become tensionless, and the low-energy theory becomes a non-trivial n = (2, 0) six
dimensional scft (see [91] and references therein). the low-energy spectrum on
ads5 then includes the dimensional reduction of this conformal theory on a circle. in
particular, when all the b-elds are turned o, we get the ak1 (2, 0) theory, which gives
rise to su(k) gauge elds at low-energies upon compactication on a circle. thus, the
ads/cft correspondence predicts an enhanced global su(k) symmetry at a particular
point in the parameter space of the corresponding eld theory. presumably, this point

is in a very strongly coupled regime (the string coupling iib  pi i may be chosen

to be weak, but individual is can still be strongly coupled) which cannot be accessed
directly in the eld theory. the eld theory in this case has a large group of duality
symmetries [342], which includes (but is not limited to) the sl(2, z) subgroup which
acts on the couplings as   (a + b)/(c + d) at the point where they are all equal.
in the type iib background the sl(2, z) subgroup of this duality group is manifest,
but it is not clear how to see the rest of this group.

our second example corresponds to d3-branes at an r6/z3 orbifold point, where, if
we write r6 as c3 with complex coordinates zj (j = 1, 2, 3), the z3 acts as zj  e2i/3zj.
in this case the only xed point of the z3 action is the origin, so in the near-horizon
limit we get [319] ads5  s5/z3 where the compact space is smooth. thus, the low-

116

energy spectrum in this case (for large gsn) includes only the z3 projection of the
original supergravity spectrum, and all twisted sector states are heavy in this limit.

the corresponding eld theory may be derived by the methods of [333, 334]. it is
an su(n)3 gauge theory, with chiral multiplets uj (j = 1, 2, 3) in the (n, n, 1) repre-
sentation, vj (j = 1, 2, 3) in the (1, n, n) representation, and wj (j = 1, 2, 3) in the
( n, 1, n) representation, and a classical superpotential of the form w = gijkuivjwk.
in the classical theory all three gauge couplings and the superpotential coupling g are
equal (and equal to the string coupling). in the quantum theory one can prove that
in the space of these four parameters there is a one dimensional line of superconfor-
mal xed points. the parameter which parameterizes this xed line (which passes
through weak coupling in the gauge theory) may be identied with the dilaton in the
ads5  s5/z3 background. unlike the previous case, here there are no indications of
additional marginal deformations, and no massless twisted sector states on ads5 which
they could correspond to.

as in the previous case, one can try to compare the spectrum of elds on ads5
with the spectrum of chiral operators in the eld theory. in this case, as in all cases
with less than n = 4 supersymmetry, not all the supergravity elds on ads5 are in
chiral multiplets, since the n = 4 chiral multiplets split into chiral, anti-chiral and
non-chiral multiplets when decomposed into n = 2 (or n = 1) representations8 (in
general there can also be various sizes of chiral multiplets). however, one can still
compare those of the elds which are in chiral multiplets (and have the appropriate
relations between their ads mass / eld theory dimension and their r-charges). the
untwisted states may easily be matched since they are a projection of the original
states both in space-time and in the eld theory (if we think of the eld theory as a
projection of the n = 4 su(3n) gauge theory). looking at the twisted sectors we
seem to encounter a paradox [322]. on the string theory side all the twisted sector
states are heavy (they correspond to strings stretched across the s5, so they would
correspond to operators with   mr  r2/l2
s  (gsn)1/2). on the eld theory side
we can identify the twisted sector elds with operators which are charged under the
global z3 symmetry which rotates the three gauge groups, and naively there exist chiral
operators which are charged under this symmetry and remain of nite dimension in the
large n, g2
y m n limit. however, a careful analysis shows that all of these operators are
in fact descendants, so their dimensions are not protected. for example, the operator
is the eld strength multiplet of the jth su(n)
group, seems to be a chiral supereld charged under the z3 symmetry. however, using
linear combinations of the konishi anomaly equations [346, 347] for the three gauge
groups, one can show that this operator (and all other twisted sector operators) is in
8note that this means that unlike the ads5  s5 case, in cases with less susy there are always

j=1 e2ij/3tr((w (j)

 )2), where w (j)


p3

non-chiral operators which have a nite dimension in the large n, g2

y m n limit.

117

fact a descendant, so there is no paradox. the ads/cft correspondence predicts that
in the large n, g2
y m n limit the dimension of all these z3-charged operators scales as
(g2
y m n)1/4 for the non-chiral operators
y m n)1/2, which is larger than the scaling   (g2
in the n = 4 sym theory in the same limit. it would be interesting to verify this
behavior in the eld theory. baryon-like operators also exist in these theories [348],
which are similar to those which will be discussed in section 4.1.3.

there are various other supersymmetric orbifold backgrounds which behave simi-
larly to the examples we have described in detail here. there are also many non-
supersymmetric examples [349, 350] but, as described above, their fate for nite n is
not clear, and we will not discuss them in detail here.

4.1.2 orientifolds of ads5  s5

the discussion of the near-horizon limits of d3-branes on orientifolds is mostly similar
to the discussion of orbifolds, except for the absence of twisted sector states (which do
not exist for orientifolds). we will focus here on two examples which illustrate some
of the general properties of these backgrounds. additional examples were discussed in
[351, 352, 353, 354, 355, 356, 357, 358].

our rst example is the near-horizon limit of d3-branes on an orientifold 3-plane.
the orientifold breaks the same supersymmetries as the 3-branes do, so in the near
horizon limit we have the full 32 supercharges corresponding to a d = 4,n = 4 scft.
in at space there are (see [359] and references therein) two types of orientifold planes
which lead to dierent projections on d-brane states. one type of orientifold plane
leads to a low-energy so(2n) n = 4 gauge theory for n d-branes on the orientifold,
while the other leads to a usp(2n) n = 4 gauge theory. in the rst case we can also
have an additional half d3-brane stuck on the orientifold, leading to an so(2n + 1)
n = 4 gauge theory. in the near-horizon limits of branes on the orientifold we should
be able to nd string theory backgrounds which are dual to all of these gauge theories.
the near-horizon limit of these brane congurations is type iib string theory on
ads5  s5/z2  ads5  rp5, where the z2 acts by identifying opposite points on
the s5, so there are no xed points and the space rp5 is smooth. the manifestation
of the orientifolding in the near-horizon limit is that when a string goes around a
non-contractible cycle in rp5 (connecting opposite points of the s5) its orientation
is reversed. in all the cases discussed above the string theory perturbation expansion
had only closed orientable surfaces, so it was a power series in g2
s (or in 1/n 2 in the
t hooft limit); but in this background we can also have non-orientable closed surfaces
which include crosscaps, and the perturbation expansion includes also odd powers of
gs (or of 1/n in the t hooft limit). in fact, it has long been known [34] that in the
t hooft limit the so(n) and usp(n) gauge theories give rise to feynman diagrams

118

that involve also non-orientable surfaces (as opposed to the su(n) case which gives
only orientable surfaces), so it is not surprising that such diagrams arise in the string
theory which is dual to these theories. while in the cases described above the leading
correction in string perturbation theory was of order g2
s (or 1/n 2 in the t hooft limit),
in the ads5  rp5 background (and in general in orientifold backgrounds) the leading
correction comes from rp2 worldsheets and is of order gs (or 1/n in the t hooft limit).
such a correction appears, for instance, in the computation of the central charge (the 2-
point function of the energy-momentum tensor) of these theories, which is proportional
to the dimension of the corresponding gauge group.

our discussion so far has not distinguished between the dierent congurations cor-
responding to so(2n), so(2n + 1) and usp(2n) groups (the only obvious parameter
in the orientifold background is the 5-form ux n). in the feynman diagram expansion
it is well-known [360, 361] that the so(2n) and usp(2n) theories are related by a
transformation taking n to (n), which inverts the sign of all diagrams with an odd
number of crosscaps in the t hooft limit. thus, we should look for a similar eect in
string theory on ads5rp5. it turns out [211] that this is implemented by a discrete
torsion on rp5, corresponding to turning on a bn sn s 2-form in the non-trivial co-
homology class of h 3(rp5, z) = z2. the eect of turning on this discrete torsion is
exactly to invert the sign of all string diagrams with an odd number of crosscaps. it is
also possible to turn on a similar discrete torsion for the rr 2-form b-eld, so there
is a total of four dierent possible string theories on ads5  rp5. it turns out that
the theory with no b-elds is equivalent to the so(2n) n = 4 gauge theory, which
is self-dual under the s-duality group sl(2, z). the theory with only a non-zero brr
eld is equivalent to the so(2n + 1) gauge theory, while the theories with non-zero
bn sn s elds are equivalent to the usp(2n) gauge theory [211], and this is consistent
with the action of s-duality on these groups and on the 2-form b-elds (which are a
doublet of sl(2, z)).

an interesting test of this correspondence is the matching of chiral primary elds.
in the supergravity limit the elds on ads5  rp5 are just the z2 projection of the
elds on ads5  s5, including the multiplets with n = 2, 4, 6,   (in the notation of
section 3.2). this matches with almost all the chiral superelds in the corresponding
gauge theories, which are described as traces of products of the fundamental elds as
in section 3.2, but with the trace of a product of an odd number of elds vanishing in
these theories from symmetry arguments. however, in the so(2n) gauge theories (and
not in any of the others) there is an additional gauge invariant chiral supereld, called
the pfaan, whose lowest component is of the form a1a2a2n i1
a2n 1a2n ,
where ai are so(2n) indices and the ij are (symmetric traceless) indices in the 6 of
su(4)r. the supersymmetry algebra guarantees that the dimension of this operator
is  = n, and it is independent of the other gauge-invariant chiral superelds. this

a3a4    in

a1a2i2

119

operator may be identied with the eld on ads5 corresponding to a d3-brane wrapped
around a 3-cycle in rp5, corresponding to the homology class h3(rp5, z) = z2. this
wrapping is only possible when no b-elds are turned on [211], consistent with such
an operator existing for so(2n) but not for so(2n + 1) or usp(2n). while it is
not known how to compute the mass of this state directly, the superconformal algebra
guarantees that it has the right mass to correspond to an operator with  = n; the
naive approximation to the mass, since the volume of the 3-cycle in rp5 is 2r3, is
p  n (since in the orientifold case r4  4(2n)l4
mr  r  2r3/(2)3gsl4
p
instead of equation (3.3)), which leads to the correct dimension for large n. the
existence of this operator (which decouples in the large n limit) is an important test
of the nite n correspondence. anomaly matching in this background was discussed
in [227].

s = r4/8l4

another interesting background is the near-horizon limit of d3-branes on an orien-
tifold 7-plane, with 4 d7-branes coincident on the orientifold plane to ensure [362, 363]
that the dilaton is constant and the low-energy theory is conformal (this is the same
as d3-branes in f-theory [364] at a d4-type singularity). the eld theory we get in
the near-horizon limit in this case is [365, 366] an n = 2 sqcd theory with usp(2n)
gauge group, a hypermultiplet in the anti-symmetric representation and four hyper-
multiplets in the fundamental representation. in this case the orientifold action has
xed points on the s5, so the near-horizon limit is [367, 368] type iib string theory
on ads5  s5/z2 where the z2 action has xed points on an s3 inside the s5. thus,
this background includes an orientifold plane with the topology of s3  ads5, and the
d7-branes stretched along the orientifold plane also remain as part of the background,
so that the low-energy theory includes both the supergravity modes in the bulk and the
so(8) gauge theory on the d7-branes (which corresponds to an so(8) global symme-
try in the corresponding eld theories)9. the string perturbation expansion in this case
has two sources of corrections of order gs, the crosscap diagram and the open string
disc diagram with strings ending on the d7-brane, leading to two types of corrections
of order 1/n in the t hooft limit. again, the spectrum of operators in the eld theory
may be matched [368] with the spectrum of elds coming from the dimensional reduc-
tion of the supergravity theory in the bulk and of the 7-brane theory wrapped on the
s3. the anomalies may also be matched to the eld theory, including 1/n corrections
to the leading large n result [226] which arise from disc and crosscap diagrams.

by studying other backgrounds of d3-branes with 7-branes (with or without ori-
entifolds) one can obtain non-conformal theories which exhibit a logarithmic running
of the coupling constant [368, 369]. for instance, by separating the d7-branes away
from the orientifold plane, corresponding to giving a mass to the hypermultiplets in
the fundamental representation, one nds string theory solutions in which the dilaton

9similar backgrounds were discussed in [169].

120

varies in a similar way to the variation of the coupling constant in the eld theory,
and this behavior persists also in the near-horizon limit (which is quite complicated in
this case, and becomes singular close to the branes, corresponding to the low-energy
limit of the eld theories which is in this case a free abelian coulomb phase). this
agreement with the perturbative expectation, even though we are (necessarily) in a
regime of large  = g2
y m n, is due to special properties of n = 2 gauge theories, which
prevent many quantities from being renormalized beyond one-loop.

4.1.3 conifold theories

in the correspondence between string theory on ads5  s5 and d = 4 n = 4 sym
theories, some of the most direct checks, such as protected operator dimensions and the
functional form of two- and three-point functions, are determined by properties of the
supergroup su(2, 2|4). many of the normalizations of two- and three-point functions
which have been computed explicitly are protected by non-renormalization theorems.
and yet, we are inclined to believe that the correspondence is a fundamental dynam-
ical principle, valid independent of group theory and the special non-renormalization
properties of n = 4 supersymmetry.

to test this belief we want to consider theories with reduced supersymmetry. orb-
ifold theories [319] provide interesting examples; however, as discussed in the previous
sections, it has been shown [338, 339] that at large n these theories are a projection
of n = 4 super-yang-mills theory; in particular many of their greens functions are
dictated by the greens functions of the n = 4 theory. the projection involved is
onto states invariant under the group action that denes the orbifold. intuitively, this
similarity with the n = 4 theory arises because the compact part of the geometry is
still (almost everywhere) locally s5, just with some global identications. therefore,
to make a more non-trivial test of models with reduced supersymmetry, we are more
interested in geometries of the form ads5  m5 where the compact manifold m5 is not
even locally s5.

in fact, such compactications have a long history in the supergravity literature: the
direct product geometry ads5  m5 is known as the freund-rubin ansatz [111]. the
curvature of the anti-de sitter part of the geometry is supported by the ve-form of
type iib supergravity. because this ve-form is self-dual, m5 must also be an einstein
manifold, but with positive cosmological constant: rescaling m5 if necessary, we can
write r = 4g. for simplicity, we are assuming that only the ve-form and the
metric are involved in the solution.

a trivial but useful observation is that ve-dimensional einstein manifolds with
r = 4g are in one-to-one correspondence with ricci-at manifolds c6 whose metric

121

has the conical form

it can be shown that, given any metric of the form (4.1), the ten-dimensional metric

ve-form ux through the manifold m5, where

.

(4.3)

furthermore, it was shown in [169] that the number of supersymmetries preserved by
the geometry (4.2) is half the number that are preserved by its ricci-at r  0 limit.
preservation of supersymmetry therefore amounts to the existence of a killing spinor
on ds2
c6, which would imply that it is a calabi-yau metric. finally, the r  r limit of
(4.2) is precisely ads5m5, and in that limit the number of preserved supersymmetries
doubles.

these facts suggest a useful means of searching for non-trivial freund-rubin geome-
tries: starting with a string vacuum of the form r3,1  c6, where c6 is ricci-at, we
locate a singularity of c6 where the metric locally has the form (4.1), and place a large
number of d3-branes at that point. the resulting near-horizon freund-rubin geome-
try has the same number of supersymmetries as the original braneless string geometry.
the program of searching for and classifying such singularities on manifolds preserving
some supersymmetry was enunciated most completely in [322].

we will focus our attention on the simplest non-trivial example, which was worked
out in [212]10. c6 is taken to be the standard conifold, which as a complex 3-fold is
determined by the equation

z2
1 + z2

2 + z2

3 + z2

4 = 0 .

(4.4)

the calabi-yau metric on this manifold has su(3) holonomy, so one quarter of super-
symmetry is preserved. we will always count our supersymmetries in four-dimensional
superconformal eld theory terms, so one quarter of maximal supersymmetry (that is,
eight real supercharges) is in our terminology n = 1 supersymmetry (superconformal
symmetry). the supergravity literature often refers to this amount of supersymmetry
in ve dimensions as n = 2, because in a at space supergravity theory with this
10additional aspects and examples of conifold theories were discussed in [370, 371, 372, 373, 374,

375].

p
2 3, with p and q relatively prime, were studied in [171]. the topology of each of
these manifolds is s2  s3. they all admit unique einstein metrics. only t 11 leads to
a six-manifold c6 which admits killing spinors. in fact, besides s5 = so(6)/so(5),
t 11 is the unique ve-dimensional coset space which preserves supersymmetry. the
einstein metrics can be obtained via a rescaling of the killing metric on su(2)su(2)
by a process explained in [171]. the metric on t 11 satisfying r = 4g can be written

is to rst consider the s5/z2 orbifold gauge theory, where the z2 is chosen to ip the
signs of four of the six real coordinates in r6, and thus has a xed s1 on the unit s5
in this at space. this z2 breaks so(6) down to so(4)  so(2), which is the same
isometry group as for t 11. in fact, it can also be shown that an appropriate blowup of
the singularities along the xed s1 leads to a manifold of topology s2  s3. since t 11
is a smooth deformation of the blown-up orbifold, one might suspect that its dual eld
theory is some deformation of the orbifolds dual eld theory. the latter eld theory
is well known [319], as described in section 4.1.1. it has n = 2 supersymmetry. the
eld content in n = 1 language is

the adjoint chiral elds  and , together with the n = 1 gauge multiplets, ll out
n = 2 gauge multiplets. the chiral multiplets a1, b1 combine to form an n = 2
hypermultiplet, and so do a2, b2. the superpotential is dictated by n = 2 supersym-
metry:

w = gtr(a1b1 + a2b2) + gtr (b1a1 + b2a2) ,

(4.9)

where g is the gauge coupling of both su(n) gauge groups. a relevant deformation
which preserves the global su(2)  su(2)  u(1) symmetry, and also n = 1 super-
symmetry, is

there is a nontrivial renormalization group ow induced by these mass terms. the
existence of a non-trivial infrared xed point can be demonstrated using the methods
of [376]: having integrated out the heavy elds  and , the superpotential is quartic
in the remaining elds, which should, therefore, all have dimension 3/4 at the infrared
xed point (assuming that we do not break the symmetry between the two gauge
groups). the anomalous dimension  = 1/2 for the quadratic operators trab is
precisely what is needed to make the exact beta functions vanish.

the ir xed point of the renormalization group described in the previous paragraph
is the candidate for the eld theory dual to type iib string theory on ads5  t 11, or in
weak coupling terms the low-energy eld theory of coincident d3-branes on a conifold
singularity. there are several non-trivial checks that this is the right theory. the
simplest is to note that the moduli space of the n = 1 version of the theory is simply
the conifold. for n = 1 the scalar elds ai and bj (in the chiral multiplets ai and bj)
are just complex-valued. the moduli space can be parametrized by the combinations
aibj, and if we write

(cid:18) z1 + iz4
iz2  z3

iz2 + z3

z1  iz4(cid:19) =(cid:18) a1b1 a1b2
a2b1 a2b2(cid:19) ,

(4.11)

then we recover the conifold equation (4.4) by taking the determinant of both sides.
in the n > 1 theories, a slight generalization of this line of argument leads to the
conclusion that the fully higgsed phase of the theory, where all the d3-branes are
separated from one another, has for its moduli space the n th symmetric power of the
conifold.

the most notable prediction of the renormalization group analysis of the gauge
theory is that the operators traibj should have dimension 3/2. this is something we
should be able to see from the dual description. as a warmup, consider rst the n = 4
example. there, as described in section 3.2, the lowest dimension operators have the
form tr(ij), and their dimension is two. their description in supergravity is a weyl
deformation of the s5 part of the geometry with ha
a is the trace
of the metric on s5 and y 2(y) is a d-wave spherical harmonic on s5. the four-form

a  y 2(y), where ha

124

potential dabcd is also involved in the deformation, and there are two mass eigenstates
in ads5 which are combinations of these two elds. a simple way to compute y 2 is to
start with the function xixj on r6 and restrict it to the unit s5. this suggests quite
a general way to nd eigenfunctions of the laplacian on an einstein manifold m5: we
start by looking for harmonic functions on the associated conical geometry (4.1). the
laplacian is

restricted to r = 1 have m5 f(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)r=1
a  f(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)r=1

the operator r2
c6 commutes with rr, so we can restrict our search to functions f
on c6 with c6 f = 0 and rrf = f for some constant . such harmonic functions
. following through the analysis
of [124] one learns that the mass of the lighter of the two scalars in ads5 corresponding
to ha
is m2r2 = ( 4). so, the dimension of the corresponding operator is
. in view of (4.11), all we need to do to verify in the supergravity approximation the
renormalization group prediction  = 3/2 for traibj is to show that rrzi = 3
2zi. this
follows from scaling considerations as follows. the dilation symmetry on the cone is
r  r. under this dilation, ds2
c6. the kahler form should have this same
scaling, and that will follow if also the kahler potential k  2k. as mentioned
above, the calabi-yau metric follows from k =(cid:16)p4
, which has the desired
scaling if zi  3/2zi. thus, indeed rrzi = 3

i=1 |zi|2(cid:17)2/3

it is straightforward to generalize the above line of argument to operators of the
form tra(i1b(j1 . . . ai)bj). various aspects of the matching of operators in the con-
formal eld theory to kaluza-klein modes in supergravity have been studied in [212,
170, 377]. but there is another interesting type of color singlet operators, which are
called dibaryons because the color indices of each gauge group are combined using an
antisymmetric tensor. the dibaryon operator is

where we have suppressed su(2) indices. let us use the notation su(2)a for the global
symmetry group under which ai form a doublet, and su(2)b for the group under which
bj form a doublet. clearly, (4.13) is a singlet under su(2)b. this provides the clue
to its string theory dual, which must also be su(2)b-symmetric:
it is a d3-brane
wrapped on t 11 along an orbit of su(2)b [213]. using the explicit metric (4.7), it
is straightforward to verify that mr  3
4n in the test brane approximation. up to
corrections of order 1/n, the mass-dimension relation is   mr, so we see that
again the eld theory prediction for the anomalous dimension of a is born out. the 3-
cycle which the d3-brane is wrapped on may be shown to be the unique homologically
non-trivial 3-cycle of t 11. there is also an anti-dibaryon, schematically bn , which
is a d3-brane wrapped on an orbit of su(2)a. the two wrappings are opposite in

125

homology, so the dibaryon and anti-dibaryon can annihilate to produce mesons. this
interesting process has never been studied in any detail, no doubt because the dynamics
is complicated and non-supersymmetric. it is possible to construct dibaryon operators
also in a variety of orbifold theories [213, 348].

the gauge theory dual to t 11 descends via renormalization group ow from the
gauge theory dual to s5/z2, as described after (4.10). the conformal anomaly has
been studied extensively for such ows (see for example [220]), and the coecient a in
(3.31) is smaller in the ir than in the uv for every known ow that connects uv and
ir xed points. to describe the attempts to prove a c-theorem, stating that this must
always be the case in four dimensions, would take us too far aeld, so instead we refer
the reader to [378] and references therein.

in the presence of n = 1 superconformal invariance, one can compute the anomaly
coecients a and c in (3.31) if one knows hrig ,b, where r is the r-current
which participates in the superconformal algebra, and the expectation value is taken
in the presence of an arbitrary metric g and an external gauge eld source b for
the r-current. the reason a and c can be extracted from this anomalous one-point
function is that r and t 
 are superpartners in the n = 1 multiplet of anomalies.
it was shown in [220] via a supergroup argument that

h(r)tti = (a  c)[ ]
h(r)rri = (5a  3c)[ ] ,

(4.14)

where now the correlators are computed in at space. the omitted expressions between
the square brackets are tensors depending on the positions or momenta of the operators
in the correlator. their form is not of interest to us here because it is the same for any
theory: we are interested instead in the coecients. these can be computed perturba-
tively via the triangle diagrams in gure 4.1. the adler-bardeen theorem guarantees
that the one loop result is exact, provided r is non-anomalous in the absence of
external sources (that is, it suers from no internal anomalies). the constants of pro-
portionality in the relations shown in gure 4.1 can be tracked down by comparing the
complete feynman diagram amplitude with the explicit tensor forms which we have
omitted from (4.14). we are mainly interested in ratios of central charges between ir
and uv xed points, so we do not need to go through this exercise.

the eld theory dual to s5/z2, expressed in n = 1 language, has the eld con-
tent described in (4.8). the r-current of the chosen n = 1 superconformal algebra
descends from a u(1) in the so(6) r-symmetry group of the n = 4 algebra, and it
assigns a u(1)r charge r() = 1 to the 2n 2 gauginos (fermionic components of the
vector supereld) and r() = 1/3 to the 6n 2 quarks (fermionic components of the
chiral superelds)11. we have p r() = 0, which means that the r-current has no

gravitational anomalies [379].

for the eld theory dual to t 11, the r-current described in the previous paragraph is
no longer non-anomalous because we have added a mass to the adjoint chiral superelds.
there is, however, a non-anomalous combination s of this current, r, with the
konishi currents, k i
, which by denition assign charge 1 to the fermionic elds in the
ith chiral multiplet and charge 0 to the fermionic elds in the vector multiplets:

s = r + 2

(4.15)

ir = b

here i is the anomalous dimension of the ith chiral supereld. at the strongly in-
teracting n = 1 infrared xed point, s is the current which participates in the
superconformal algebra. however, to compute correlators h(s) . . .i it is more con-
venient to go to the ultraviolet, where i = 0 and the perturbative analysis in terms
of fermions running around a loop can be applied straightforwardly. using the fact
that a
ir = 1/2, we nd that suv() = 1 for the gaugi-
nos, suv() = 1/2 for the quarks which stay light (i.e., the bifundamental quarks),
and suv() = 0 for the quarks which are made heavy (that is, the adjoint quarks).
note that it is immaterial whether we include these heavy quarks in the triangle dia-
gram, which is as it should be since we can integrate them out explicitly. as before,

ir = 1/4 and 

p suv() = 0, so there are no gravitational anomalies and air = cir. combining the

information in the past two paragraphs, we have a eld theory prediction for the ow

in agreement with (4.16). it is essential that the volumes in (4.19) be computed for
manifolds with the same cosmological constant. our convention has been to have
r = 4g.

it is possible to do better and pin down the exact normalization of the central
charges.
in fact, literally the rst normalization check performed in the ads/cft
correspondence was the verication [18] that in the compactication dual to n = 4
su(n) yang-mills theory, the coecient c had the value n 2/4 (to leading order in
large n). thus, in general

a = c =

3n 2

4 vol m5

(4.20)

(again to leading order in large n) for the cft dual to a freund-rubin geometry
ads5  m5 supported by n units of ve-form ux through the m5. this is in a

128

normalization convention where the cft comprised of a single free real scalar eld
has c = 1/120. see, for example, [170] for a table of standard anomaly coecients per
degree of freedom. even more generally, we can consider any compactication of string
theory or m-theory (or any other, as-yet-unknown theory of quantum gravity) whose
non-compact portion is ads5. this would include in particular type iib supergravity
geometries which involve the bn s,rr
elds, or the complex coupling  . say the ads5
geometry has r = g. if we rescale the metric by a factor of 4/, we obtain the
5 with r = 4g. in dening a conformal eld theory
dimensionless ads5 metric cds
through its duality to the ads5 compactication under consideration, the part of the
action relevant to the computation of central charges is still the einstein-hilbert term
plus the cosmological term:

2

(4.21)

where 2
5 = 8g5 is the ve-dimensional gravitational coupling. comparing straight-
forwardly with the special case analyzed in (4.20), we nd that the conformal anomaly
coecients, as always to leading order in 1/n, must be given by

a = c =

1

g53/2 .

(4.22)

4.2 d-branes in ads, baryons and instantons

a conservative form of the ads/cft correspondence would be to say that classical
supergravity captures the large n asymptotics of some quantities in eld theory which
are algebraically protected against dependence on the t hooft coupling. the stronger
form which is usually advocated, and which we believe is true, is that the eld theory
is literally equivalent to the string theory, and the only issue is understanding the
mapping from one to the other. to put this belief to the test, it is natural to ask
what in eld theory corresponds to non-perturbative objects, such as d-branes, in
string theory. the answer was found in [211] for several types of wrapped branes
(see also [285] for an independent analysis of some cases), and subsequent papers
[380, 381, 382, 181, 383, 384, 322, 385, 348, 386, 387] have extended and elaborated
on the story. see also [388, 389] for actions for d-branes in anti-de sitter space, and
[390, 391] for other related topics. the connection between d-instantons and gauge
theory instantons has also been extensively studied, and we summarize the results at
the end of this section.

let us start with wrapped branes which have no spatial extent in ads5, namely
they are particles propagating in this space. the eld theory interpretation must be
in terms of some vertex or operator, as for any other particle in ads (as described

129

above in the case of supergravity particles). if the compact manifold is s5, then the
only topologically stable possibility is a wrapped 5-brane. the key observation here is
that charge conservation requires that n strings must run into or out of the 5-brane.
in the case of a d5-brane, these n strings are fundamental strings (one could also
consider sl(2, z) images of this conguration). the argument is a slight variant of
the ones used in the discussion of anomalous brane creation [392, 393, 394]. there are
n units of ve-form (f5) ux on the s5, and the coupling 1
2 a  f5 in the d5-brane
world-volume translates this ux into n units of charge under the u(1) gauge eld a
on the d5-brane. since the d5-brane spatial world-volume is closed, the total charge
must be zero. a string running out of the d5-brane counts as (1) unit of u(1) charge,
hence the conclusion. reversing the orientation of the d5-brane changes the sign of
the charge induced by f5, and correspondingly the n strings should run into the brane
rather than out.

in the absence of other d-branes, the strings cannot end anywhere in ads5, so they
must run out to the boundary. a string ending on the boundary is interpreted (see sec-
tion 3.5) as an electric charge in the fundamental representation of the su(n) gauge
group: an external (non-dynamical) quark. this interpretation comes from viewing
the strings as running from the d5-brane to a d3-brane at innity. it was shown in
[393] that such stretched strings have a unique ground state which is fermionic, and
the conclusion is that the d5-brane baryon is precisely an antisymmetric combina-
tion of n fermionic fundamental string quarks. the gauge theory interpretation is
clear: because the gauge group is su(n) rather than u(n), there is a gauge-invariant
baryonic vertex for n external fundamental quarks. we will return to a discussion of
baryonic objects in section 6.2.2.

to obtain other types of wrapped brane objects with no spatial extent in ads5, we
must turn to compact manifolds with more nontrivial homology cycles. apart from the
intrinsic interest of studying such objects and the gauge theories in which they occur,
the idea is to verify the claim that every object we can exhibit in gauge theory has a
stringy counterpart, and vice versa.

following [211] and the discussion in section 4.1.2, we now examine wrapped branes
in the ads5  rp5 geometry, which is the near-horizon geometry of d3-branes placed
on top of a z2 orientifold three-plane (the z2 acts as xi  xi for the six coordinates
perpendicular to the d3-branes). h3(rp5, z) = z2, and the generator of the homology
group is a projective space rp3  rp5. this seems to oer the possibility of wrapping
a d3-brane on a 3-cycle to get a particle in ads5. however, there is a caveat: as argued
in [211] the wrapping is permitted only if there is no discrete torsion for the ns and
rr b-elds. in gauge theory terms, that amounts to saying that the corresponding
operator is permitted if and only if the gauge group is so(n) with n even. direct
calculation leads to a mass m  n/r for the wrapped brane, so the corresponding

130

gauge theory operator has dimension n (at least to leading order in large n). a
beautiful fact is that a candidate gauge theory operator exists precisely when the
gauge group is so(n) with n even: it is the pfaan operator,

1

(n/2)!

a1a2...an a1a2 . . . an 1an .

(4.23)

here the elds ab are the adjoint scalar bosons which are the n = 4 superpartners
of the gauge bosons. we have suppressed their global avor index. a similar wrapped
3-brane was discussed in section 4.1.3, where the 3-brane was wrapped around the
3-cycle of t 11 (which is topologically s2  s3).

it is also interesting to consider branes with spatial extent in ads5. strings in ads5
were discussed in section 3.5. a three-brane in ads5 (by which we mean any wrapped
brane with three dimensions of spatial extent in ads5) aligned with one direction
perpendicular to the boundary must correspond to some sort of domain wall in the
in ads5  s5, if the three-brane is a d3-
eld theory. some examples are obvious:
brane, then crossing the domain wall shifts the 5-form ux and changes the gauge group
from su(n) to su(n + 1) or su(n  1). a less obvious example was considered in
[211]: crossing a d5-brane or ns5-brane wrapped on some rp2  rp5 changes the
discrete torsion of the rr or ns b-eld, and so one can switch between so(n) and
sp(n/2) gauge groups. d5-branes on homology 2-cycles of the base of conifolds and
orbifolds, have also been studied [213, 372, 348, 395], and the conclusion is that they
correspond to domain walls across which the rank of some factor in the product gauge
group is incremented.

another brane wrapping possibility is branes with two dimensions of spatial extent
in ads5. these become strings in the gauge theory when they are oriented with one
dimension along the radial direction. in a particular model (an su(n)3 gauge theory
whose string theory image is ads5 s5/z3) the authors of [348] elucidated their mean-
ing: they are strings which give rise to a monodromy for the wave-functions of particles
transported around them. the monodromy belongs to a discrete symmetry group of
the gauge theory. the familiar example of such a phenomenon is the aharonov-bohm
eect, where the electrons wave-function picks up a u(1) phase when it is transported
around a tube of magnetic ux. the analysis of [348] extends beyond their specic
model, and applies in particular to strings in so(n) gauge theories, with n even,
obtained from wrapping a d3-brane on a generator of h1(rp5, z), where the rp5 has
no discrete torsion.

finally, we turn to one of the most familiar examples of a non-perturbative object
in gauge theory: the instanton. the obvious candidate in string theory to describe an
instanton is the d-instanton, also known as the d(-1)-brane. the correspondence in
this case has been treated extensively in the literature [396, 397, 398, 399, 400, 401,
402, 403]. the presentation in [403] is particularly comprehensive, and the reader who

131

is interested in a more thorough review of the subject can nd it there. note that the
analysis of instantons in large n gauge theories is problematic since their contribution
is (at least naively) highly suppressed; the k instanton contribution comes with a factor
y m = e82kn/ which goes like en in the t hooft limit. therefore, we can
of e82k/g2
only discuss instanton contributions to quantities that get no other contributions to
any order in the 1/n expansion. luckily, such quantities exist in the n = 4 sym
theory, like the one discussed below.

the einstein metric on ads5  s5 is unaected by the presence of a d-instanton.
the massless elds in ve dimensions which acquire vevs in the presence of a d-
instanton are the axion and the dilaton: in a coordinate system for the poincare patch
of ads5 where

we have [397, 398, 399, 401]

for a d-instanton whose location in anti-de sitter space is (x, z). it can be shown using

instanton, 82/g2
y m = 4gs. the result (4.26) is insensitive
to whether the d-instanton is localized on the s5, since the eld under consideration
is an so(6) singlet. it is a satisfying verication of the interpretation of the variable
z as inverse energy scale that the position z of the d-instanton translates into the size
of the gauge theory instanton. in other words, we understand the ads5 factor (which
appears in the moduli space of an su(2) instanton) as merely specifying the position
of the d-instanton in the ve-dimensional bulk theory.

in fact, at large n, a yang-mills instanton is parametrized not only by a point in
ads5, but also by a point in s5. the s5 emerges from keeping track of the fermionic
instanton zero modes properly [403]. the approach is to form a bilinear ab in the zero
modes. ab is antisymmetric in the four-valued su(4) indices a and b, and satises
a hermiticity condition that makes it transform in the real 6 of so(6). dual variables
ab can be introduced into the path integral which have the same antisymmetry and

132

hermiticity properties: the possible values of ab correspond to points in r6. when the
fermions are integrated out, the resulting determinant acts as a potential for the ab
elds, with a minimum corresponding to an s5 whose radius goes into the determination
of the overall normalization of correlation functions.

building on the work of [396] on  corrections to the four-point function of stress-
tensors, the authors of [399] have computed contributions to correlators coming from
instanton sectors of the gauge theory and successfully matched them with d-instanton
calculations in string theory.
it is not entirely clear why the agreement is so good,
since the gauge theory computations rely on small t hooft coupling (while the string
theory computations are for xed g2
y m in the large n limit) and non-renormalization
theorems are not known for the relevant correlators. the simplest example turns out
to be the sixteen-point function of superconformal currents a
a),
where f  is the self-dual part of the eld-strength, a is an index in the fundamental
of su(4),  and  are lorentz spinor indices, and  and  are the usual lorentz vector
indices. one needs sixteen insertions of  to obtain a non-zero result from the sixteen
grassmannian integrations over the fermionic zero modes of an instanton. the gauge
theory result for gauge group su(2) turns out to be

to an overall factor. the overall factor can only be tracked down by redoing the gauge
theory calculation with gauge group su(n), with proper attention paid to the saddle
point integration over fermionic zero modes, as alluded to in the previous paragraph.

133

the computation of greens functions such as (4.27) has been extended in [403] to the
case of multiple instantons. here one starts with a puzzle. the d-instantons eectively
form a bound state because integrations over their relative positions converge. thus
the string theory result has the same form as (4.27), with only a single integration
in view of the emergence of an s5 from the fermionic
over a point (x, z) in ads5.
zero modes at large n, the expectation on the gauge theory side is that the moduli
space for k instantons should be k copies of ads5  s5. but through an analysis of
small uctuations around saddle points of the path integral it was shown that most of
the moduli are lifted quantum mechanically, and what is left is indeed a single copy
of ads5  s5 as the moduli space, with a prefactor on the saddle point integration
corresponding to the partition function of the zero-dimensional su(k) gauge theory
which lives on k coincident d-instantons. it is assumed that k  n. although the
k instantons clump in moduli space, their eld congurations involve k commuting
su(2) subgroups of the su(n) gauge group. the correlation functions computed in
gauge theory have essentially the same form as (4.27). in comparing with the string
theory analysis, one picks out the k-instanton contribution in the taylor expansion
of the modular form in (4.28). there is perfect agreement at large n for every nite
k, which presumably means that there is some unknown non-renormalization theorem
protecting these terms.

4.3 deformations of the conformal field theory

in this section we discuss deformations of the conformal eld theory, and what they
correspond to in its dual description involving string theory on ads space. we will
focus on the case of the n = 4 eld theory, though the general ideas hold also for
all other examples of the ads/cft correspondence. we start in section 4.3.1 with a
general discussion of deformations in eld theory and in the dual description. then
in section 4.3.2 we use the ads/cft correspondence to prove a restricted c-theorem.
in section 4.3.3 we discuss the interesting relevant and marginal deformations of the
n = 4 sym eld theory; and in section 4.3.4 we review what is known about these
deformations from the point of view of type iib string theory on ads5  s5. the
results we present will be based on [406, 145, 144, 146, 407, 143].

4.3.1 deformations in the ads/cft correspondence

conformal eld theories have many applications in their own right, but since our main
interest (at least in the context of four dimensional eld theories) is in studying non-
conformal eld theories like qcd, it is interesting to ask how we can learn about non-
conformal eld theories from conformal eld theories. one way to break conformal

134

invariance, described in section 3.6, is to examine the theory at nite temperature.
however, it is also possible to break conformal invariance while preserving lorentz
invariance, by deforming the action by local operators,

s  s + hz d4xo(x),

(4.30)

for some lorentz scalar operator o and some coecient h.

the analysis of such a deformation depends on the scaling dimension  of the op-
erator o 12. if  < 4, the eect of the deformation is strong in the ir and weak in
the uv, and the deformation is called relevant. if  > 4, the deformation is called
irrelevant, and its eect becomes stronger as the energy increases. since we generally
describe eld theories by starting with some uv xed point and owing to the ir, it
does not really make sense to start with a cft and perform an irrelevant deformation,
since this would really require a new uv description of the theory. thus, we will not
discuss irrelevant deformations here. the last case is  = 4, which is called a marginal
deformation, and which does not break conformal invariance to leading order in the
deformation. generally, even if the dimension of an operator equals 4 in some cft,
this will no longer be true after deforming by the operator, and conformal invariance
will be broken. such deformations can be either marginally relevant or marginally ir-
relevant, depending on the dimension of the operator o for nite small values of h. in
special cases the dimension of the operator will remain  = 4 for any value of h, and
conformal invariance will be present for any value of h. in such a case the deformation
is called exactly marginal, and the conformal eld theories for all values of h are called
a xed line (generalizing the concept of a conformal eld theory as a xed point of the
renormalization group ow). when a deformation is relevant conformal invariance will
be broken, and there are various possibilities for the ir behavior of the eld theory. it
can either ow to some new conformal eld theory, which can be free or interacting, or
it can ow to a trivial eld theory (this happens when the theory connes and there
are no degrees of freedom below some energy scale ). we will encounter examples of
all of these possibilities in section 4.3.3.

the analysis of deformations in the dual string theory on ads space follows from
our description of the matching of the partition functions in sections 3.1 and 3.3.
the eld theory with the deformation (4.30) is described by examining string theory
backgrounds in which the eld  on ads space, which corresponds to the operator o,
behaves near the boundary of ads space like (x, u) u hu 4, where [o] =  and
we use the coordinate system (2.27) (with u instead of u). in principle, we should sum
over all backgrounds with this boundary condition. note that, as mentioned in section

12if the operator does not have a xed scaling dimension we can write it as a sum of operators which
are eigenfunctions of the scaling operator, and treat the deformation as a sum of the appropriate
deformations.

135

3.3, in minkowski space this involves turning on the non-normalizable solution to the
eld equations for (x, u); turning on the normalizable mode (as done for instance
in [408, 409, 410, 411, 412, 413]) cannot be understood as a deformation of the eld
theory, but instead corresponds to a dierent state in the same eld theory [414]. as
in the eld theory, we see a big dierence between the cases of  > 4 and  < 4.
when  > 4, the deformation grows as we approach the boundary, so the solution
near the boundary will no longer look like ads space; this is analogous to the fact that
we need a new uv description of the eld theory in this case. on the other hand, when
 < 4, the solution goes to zero at the boundary, so asymptotically the solution just
goes over to the ads solution, and the only changes will be in the interior. for  = 4
the solution naively goes to a constant at the boundary, but one needs to analyze the
behavior of the string theory solutions beyond the leading order in the deformation
to see if the exact solution actually grows as we approach the boundary (a marginally
irrelevant deformation), decreases there (a marginally relevant deformation) or goes to
a constant (an exactly marginal deformation).

an exactly marginal deformation will correspond to a space of solutions of string
theory, whose metric will always include an ads5 factor13, but the other elds can
vary as a function of the deformation parameters. a relevant (or marginally relevant)
deformation will change the behavior in the interior, and the metric will no longer be
that of ads space. if we start in the regime of large gsn where there is a supergrav-
ity approximation to the space, the deformation may be describable in supergravity
terms, or it may lead to large elds and curvatures in the interior which will cause the
supergravity approximation to break down. the ir behavior of the corresponding eld
theory will be reected in the behavior of the string theory solution for small values
of u (away from the boundary). if the solution asymptotes to an ads solution also at
small u, the eld theory will ow in the ir to a non-trivial xed point14. note that
the variables describing this ads space may be dierent from the variables describing
the original (uv) ads space, for instance the form of the so(4, 2) isometries may be
dierent [144]. if the solution is described in terms of a space which has a non-zero
minimal value of u (similar to the space which appears in the ads-schwarzschild black
hole solution described in section 3.6, but in this case with the full iso(3, 1) isom-
etry group unbroken) the eld theory will conne and be trivial in the ir. in other
cases the geometrical description of the space could break down for small values of u;
presumably this is what happens when the eld theory ows to a free theory in the ir.
13the full space does not necessarily have to be a direct product ads5  x, but could also be a
14four dimensional eld theories are believed [415] to have a c-theorem analogous to the 2-
dimensional c-theorem [75] which states that the central charge of the ir xed point will be smaller
than that of the uv xed point. we will discuss some evidence for this in the ads context, based on
the analysis of the low-energy gravity theory, in the next subsection.

4.3.2 a c-theorem

without a detailed analysis of matter elds involved in non-anti-de sitter geometries,
there are few generalities one can make about the description of renormalization group
ows in the ads/cft correspondence15. however, there is one general result in gravity
[143] (see also [145]) which translates into a c-theorem via the correspondence. let us
consider d-dimensional metrics of the form

ds2 = e2a(r)(dt2 + d~x2) + dr2 .

(4.31)

any metric with poincare invariance in the t, ~x directions can be brought into this form
by an appropriate choice of the radial variable r. straightforward calculations yield

(d  2)a = rt

t  rr

r = gt

t  gr

r = 2

d(t t

t  t r

r )  0 .

(4.32)

in the second to last step we have used einsteins equation, and in the last step we
have assumed that the weak energy condition holds in the form

t    0

(4.33)

for any null vector  . this form of the weak energy condition is also known as the
null energy condition, and it is obeyed by all elds which arise in kaluza-klein com-
pactications of supergravity theories to d dimensions. thus, we can take it as a fairly
general fact that a  0 for d > 2. furthermore, the inequality is saturated precisely
for anti-de sitter space, where the only contribution to t is from the cosmological
constant. thus in particular, any deformation of adsd arising from turning on scalar
elds will cause a to be concave as a function of r. if we are interested in relevant
deformations of the conformal eld theory, then we should recover linear behavior in a
near the boundary, which corresponds to the (conformal) ultraviolet limit in the eld
theory. without loss of generality, then, we assume a(r)  r/ as r  .

the inequality a  0 implies that the function

c(r) 

1

ad2

(4.34)

decreases monotonically as r decreases. now, suppose there is a region where a is nearly
linear over a range of r corresponding to many orders of magnitude of ea(r). this is
the bulk analog of a scaling region in the boundary eld theory. the asymptotically
linear behavior of a(r) as r   indicates an ultraviolet scaling region which extends
arbitrarily high in energy. if a(r) recovers linear behavior as r  , there is an
15see [416, 417, 418, 419, 420] for general discussions of the renormalization group ow in the context

of the ads/cft correspondence.

137

infrared scaling region; and there could also be large though nite scaling regions in
between. assuming odd bulk dimension d, the perfect adsd spacetime which any
such scaling region approximates leads to an anomalous vev

ad2

,

(4.35)

where the numerator is a combination of curvature invariants which can be read o
from the analysis of [221] (see section 3.2.2). the point is that in limits where conformal
invariance is recovered, the expression (4.34) coincides with the anomaly coecients of
the boundary eld theory, up to factors of order unity which are universal for all cfts
in a given dimension. thus, c(r) is a c-function, and the innocuous inequality a  0
amounts to a c-theorem provided that einstein gravity is a reliable approximation to
the bulk physics.

in geometries such as the interpolating kinks of [145, 144, 143] (discussed in more
detail in section 4.3.4), the outer anti-de sitter region is distinguishable from the inner
one in that it has a boundary. there can only be one boundary (in einstein frame)
because a gets large and positive only once. in fact, the inner anti-de sitter region has
nite proper volume if the coordinates t and ~x in (4.31) are made periodic. supergravity
is capable of describing irreversible renormalization group ows despite the reversibility
of the equations, simply because the basic prescription for associating the partition
functions of string theory and eld theory makes use of the unique boundary.

4.3.3 deformations of the n = 4 su (n ) sym theory

the most natural deformations to examine from the eld theory point of view are mass
deformations, that would give a mass to the scalar and/or fermion elds in the n = 4
vector multiplet. one is tempted to give a mass to all the scalars and fermions in the
theory, in order to get a theory that will ow to the pure yang-mills (ym) theory
in the ir. such a deformation would involve operators of the form tr(ii) for the
scalar masses, and [tr(ab) + c.c.] for the fermion masses. in the weak coupling
regime of small  = g2
y m n, such deformations indeed make sense and would lead to
a pure yang-mills theory in the ir. however, the analysis of this region requires an
understanding of the string theory in the high-curvature region which corresponds to
small , which is not yet available. with our present knowledge of string theory we
are limited to analyzing the strong coupling regime of large , where supergravity is
a good approximation to the full string theory. in this regime there are two problems
with the mass deformation described above :

 the operator tr(ii) is a non-chiral operator, so the analysis of section 3.2.1
suggests that for large  it acquires a dimension which is at least as large as

138

1/4, and in particular for large enough values of  it is an irrelevant operator.
thus, we cannot deform the theory by this operator for large .
in any case
this operator is not dual to a supergravity eld, so analyzing the corresponding
deformation requires going beyond the supergravity approximation.

 the pure ym theory is a conning theory which dynamically generates a mass
scale y m , which is the characteristic mass scale for the particles (glueballs) of
the theory. when we deform the n = 4 theory by a mass deformation with
a mass scale m, a one-loop analysis suggests that the mass scale y m will be
given by y m  mec/g2
y m (m)n , where c is a constant which does not depend on
n (arising from the one-loop analysis) and g2
y m (m) is the coupling constant at
the scale m. thus, we nd that while for small  we have y m  m and there
is a separation of scales between the dynamics of the massive modes and the
dynamics of the ym theory we want to study, for large  we have y m  m and
there is no such separation of scales (for non-supersymmetric mass deformations
the one-loop analysis we made is not exact, but an exact analysis is not expected
to change the qualitative behavior we describe). thus, we cannot really study
the pure ym theory, or any other conning theory (which does not involve all
the elds of the original n = 4 theory) as long as we are in the strong coupling
regime where supergravity is a good approximation.

we will see below that, while we can nd ways to get around the rst problem and
give masses to the scalar elds, there are no known ways to solve the second problem
and study interesting conning eld theories using the supergravity approximation. of
course, in the full string theory there is no such problem, and the mass deformation
described above, for small , gives an implicit string theory construction of the non-
supersymmetric pure ym theory.

in the rest of this section we will focus on the deformations that can arise in the
strong coupling regime, and which may be analyzed in the supergravity approximation.
as described in section 3.2.1, the only operators whose dimension remains small for
large n and large  are the chiral primary operators, so we are limited to deforma-
tions by these operators. let us start by analyzing the symmetries that are preserved
by such deformations. most of the chiral operators are in non-trivial su(4)r rep-
resentations, so they break the su(4)r group to some subgroup which depends on
the representation of the operator we are deforming by. generic deformations will
also completely break the supersymmetry. one analyzes how much supersymmetry a
particular deformation breaks by checking how many supercharges annihilate it. for
example, deformations which preserve n = 1 supersymmetry are annihilated by the
supercharges q and q  of some n = 1 subalgebra of the n = 4 algebra. given
the structure of the chiral representations described in section 3.2.1 it is easy to see

139

if a deformation by such an operator preserves any supersymmetry or not. exam-
ples of deformations which preserve some supersymmetry are superpotentials of the
form w = htr(i1i2    in), which to leading order in h add to the lagrangian a
term of the form [htr(a1a2i1    in2) + c.c.]. these operators are part of
the scalar operators described in section 3.2.1 arising at dimension n + 1 in the chiral
multiplet. in order to preserve supersymmetry one must also add to the lagrangian
various terms of order h2, so we see that the question of whether a deformation breaks
supersymmetry or not depends not only on the leading order operator we deform by
but also on additional operators which we may or may not add at higher orders in the
deformation parameter (note that the form of the chiral operators also changes when
we deform, so an exact analysis of the deformations beyond the leading order in the
deformation is highly non-trivial). another example of a supersymmetry-preserving
deformation is a superpotential of the form w = htr(w 2
i1    in2), which deforms
the theory by some of the scalar operators arising at dimension n + 2 in the chiral
multiplet (e.g. the dilaton deformation for n = 2, which actually preserves the full
n = 4 supersymmetry).

the list of chiral operators which correspond to marginal or relevant deformations
was given in section 3.2.1. there is a total of 6 such operators, three of which are
the lowest components of the chiral multiplets with n = 2, 3, 416. these operators
are traceless symmetric products of scalars on = tr({i1i2    in}), which viewed
as deformations of the theory correspond to non-positive-denite potentials for the
scalar elds. thus, at least if we are thinking of the theory on r4 where the scalars
have at directions before adding the potential, these deformations do not make sense
since they would cause the theory to run away along the at directions. in particular,
the deformation in the 20 which naively gives a mass to the scalars really creates a
negative mass squared for at least some of the scalars, so it cannot be treated as a
small deformation of the uv conformal theory at the origin of moduli space. we will
focus here only on deformations by the other 3 operators, which all seem to make sense
in the eld theory.

one marginal operator of dimension 4 is the operator which couples to the dilaton,
which is a 1 of su(4)r, of the form [tr(f 2
) + itr(f  f ) +   ]. deforming by
this operator corresponds to changing the coupling constant y m of the eld theory,
and is known to be an exactly marginal deformation which does not break any of the
symmetries of the theory.

the other two relevant or marginal deformations are the scalars of dimension n + 1
in the n = 2 and n = 3 multiplets. let us start by describing the relevant deformation,

16in a u (n ) theory there is an additional scalar operator which is the lowest component of the

n = 1 multiplet.

140

which is a dimension 3 operator in the 10 of su(4)r, of the form

htr(ab) + tr([i, j]k)i ,

(4.36)

where the indices are contracted to be in the 10 of su(4)r (which is in the symmetric
product of two 4s and in the self-dual antisymmetric product of three 6s). this
operator is complex; obviously when we add it to the lagrangian we need to add it
together with its complex conjugate. the coecient parametrizing the deformation
is a complex number ma in the 10 of su(4)r. deforming by this operator obviously
gives a mass to some or all of the fermion elds , depending on the exact values of
ma. for generic values of ma, all the fermions will acquire a mass and supersymmetry
will be completely broken. the scalars will then obtain a mass from loop diagrams in
the eld theory, so that the low-energy theory below a scale of order ma will be the
pure non-supersymmetric yang-mills theory. unfortunately, as described above, for
large  = g2
y m n this is not really a good description since this theory will conne at a
scale y m of order m. however, for small  this deformation does enable us to obtain
the pure ym theory as a deformation of the n = 4 theory.

it is interesting to ask what happens if we give a mass only to some of the fermions.
in this case we may or may not preserve some amount of supersymmetry (obviously,
preserving n = 1 supersymmetry requires leaving at least one adjoint fermion mass-
less). the deformations which preserve at least n = 1 supersymmetry correspond to
superpotentials of the form w = mijtr(ij). choosing an n = 1 subgroup breaks
su(4)r to su(3)  u(1)r, and (if we choose the u(1) normalization so that the su-
percharges decompose as 4 = 31 + 13) the 10 decomposes as 10 = 62 + 32 + 16.
the susy preserving deformation mij is then in the 62 representation, and it further
breaks both the su(3) and the u(1). in a supersymmetric deformation we obviously
need to also add masses of order m2 to some of the scalars; naively this leads to a con-
tradiction because, as described above, there are no reasonable scalar masses to add
which are in chiral operators. however, at order m2 we have to take into account also
the mixings between operators which occur at order m in the deformation17; the form
of the chiral operators changes after we deform, and they mix with other operators
(in particular, the form of the operator which is an eigenvalue of the scaling operator
changes when we turn on m). in the case of the supersymmetric mass deformation, at
order m the chiral operator (4.36) described above mixes with the non-chiral tr(ii)
operator giving the scalars a mass, so there is no contradiction. the simplest way
to see this operator mixing in the susy-preserving case is to note that the n = 1
susy transformations in the presence of a general superpotential include terms of the
d i , which lead to corrections of order m to [q2,o2] which is the
form {q, i}  
operator that we are deforming by.

d w

17similar mixings were recently discussed in [233].

141

there are two interesting ways to give a mass to only one of the fermions. one of
them is a particular case of the susy-preserving deformation described above, of the
form w = mtr(11), which is an element of the 62 of su(3)  u(1), and breaks
su(4)r  su(2)  u(1) while preserving n = 1 susy (but breaking the conformal
invariance). the other possibility is to use the deformation in the 16, which breaks
susy completely but preserves an su(3) subgroup of su(4)r. to leading order in
the deformation both possibilities give a mass to one fermion, but at order m2 they
dier in a way which causes one of them to break susy while the other further breaks
su(3)  su(2)u(1). at weak coupling we can analyze the order m2 terms in detail.
in the susy-preserving deformation at order m2 we turn on a scalar mass term of the
form |m|2tr[(1)2 + (2)2], which may be written in the form

|m|2

tr[2(1)2 + 2(2)2  (3)2  (4)2  (5)2  (6)2] + |m|2

where the rst term is one of the  = 2 chiral operators in the 20, and the second term
is a non-chiral operator which arises from the operator mixing as described above (the
appearance of the second term allows us to add the chiral operator in the rst term
without destroying the positivity of the scalar potential). in the non-susy deformation
the chiral term is not turned on at any order in the deformation (the 20 representation
contains no singlets of su(3)), and all the scalars get equal masses from the non-chiral
term.

which theory do we ow to in the ir after turning on such a single-fermion mass
term ? in the susy-preserving case one can show that we actually ow to an n = 1
scft (and, in fact, to a xed line of n = 1 scfts). naively, one chiral multiplet
gets a mass, and we remain with the n = 1 su(n) sqcd theory with two adjoint
chiral multiplets, which is expected (based on the amount of matter in the theory)
to ow to an interacting ir xed point. in fact, one can prove [407] that there is an
exactly marginal operator at that xed point, which (generally) has a non-zero value in
the ir theory we get after the ow described above. the full superpotential with the
deformation is of the form w = htr(1[2, 3]) + mtr(11) (where h is proportional
to gy m ), and to describe the low-energy theory we can integrate out the massive eld
1 to remain with a superpotential w =  h2
4m tr([2, 3]2) for the remaining massless
elds. naively this superpotential is irrelevant (its dimension at the uv xed point
at weak coupling is 5), but in fact one can show (for instance, using the methods of
[376]) that it is exactly marginal in the ir theory, so there is a xed line of scfts
parametrized by the coecient h of the superpotential w = htr([2, 3]2). upon
starting from a particular value of gy m in the uv and performing the supersymmetric
mass deformation, we will land in the ir at some particular point on the ir xed line
(i.e. some value of h). the unbroken global u(1) symmetry of the theory becomes the
u(1)r in the n = 1 superconformal algebra in the ir.

142

it is more dicult to analyze the mass deformation which does not preserve susy
(but preserves su(3)), since we cannot use the powerful constraints of supersymmetry.
naively one would expect this deformation to lead to masses (from loop diagrams) for
all of the scalars, but not for the fermions, since the su(3) symmetry prevents them
from acquiring a mass. then, the ir theory seems to be su(n) yang-mills coupled
to three adjoint fermions, which presumably ows to an ir xed point (this is what
happens for supersymmetric theories with one-loop beta functions of the same order,
but it is conceivable also that the theory may conne and generate a mass scale). there
is no reason for such a xed point to have any exactly marginal deformations (in fact,
there are no known examples in four dimensions of non-supersymmetric theories with
exactly marginal deformations), so presumably the ow starting from any value of gy m
always ends up at the same ir xed point.

if we give a mass to two of the fermions, it is possible to do this with a superpotential
of the form w = mtr(12) which in fact preserves n = 2 supersymmetry (it gives
the n = 2 sqcd theory with one massive adjoint hypermultiplet, which was discussed
in [421]). this theory is known to dynamically generate a mass scale, at which the
su(n) symmetry is broken (at a generic point in the moduli space) to u(1)n1, and
the low-energy theory is the theory of (n1) free u(1) vector multiplets. the behavior
of this theory for large n was discussed in [422]. at special points in the moduli space
there are massless charged particles, and at even more special points in the moduli
space [423, 424, 425] there are massless electrically and magnetically charged particles
and the theory is a non-trivial n = 2 scft. it is not completely clear which point in
the moduli space one would ow to upon adding the mass deformation to the n = 4
theory. presumably, without any additional ne-tuning one would end up at a generic
point in the moduli space which corresponds to a free ir theory.

if we give a mass to two fermions while breaking supersymmetry (as above, this
depends on the order m2 terms that we add), we presumably end up in the ir with
yang-mills theory coupled to two massless adjoint fermions. this theory is expected
to conne at some scale y m (which for large g2
y m n would be of the order of the scale
m), and lead to a trivial theory in the ir. a similar conning behavior presumably
occurs if we give a mass to three or four of the fermions (for three fermions we can
give a mass while preserving susy, and we presumably ow in the ir to the conning
n = 1 pure sym theory).

the only remaining deformation is the deformation by the  = 4 operator in the 45
representation, which is in the n = 3 multiplet. a general analysis of this deformation
is rather dicult, so we will focus here on the susy preserving case where the defor-
mation is a superpotential of the form w = hijktr(ijk), with the coecients hijk
in the 100 representation in the decomposition 45 = 154 + 100 + 80 + 64 + 34 + 38.
it turns out that one can prove (see [376] and references therein) that two of these ten

143

deformations correspond to exactly marginal operators, that preserve n = 1 supercon-
formal invariance. this can be done by looking at a general n = 1 theory with three
adjoint chiral multiplets, a gauge coupling g, and a superpotential of the form

w = h1tr(123 +132)+h2tr((1)3 +(2)3 +(3)3)+h3ijktr(ijk). (4.38)

this particular superpotential is chosen to preserve a z3  z3 global symmetry, where
one of the z3 factors acts by 1  2, 2  3, 3  1 and the other acts by
1  1, 2  2, 3  23 where  is a third root of unity. the second z3
symmetry prevents any mixing between the chiral operators i, and the rst z3 can
then be used to show that they all have the same anomalous dimension (g, h1, h2, h3).
the beta function may be shown (using supersymmetry) to be exactly proportional to
this gamma function (with a coecient which is a function of g), so that the requirement
of conformal invariance degenerates into one equation ( = 0) in the four variables
g, h1, h2 and h3, which generically has a 3-dimensional space of solutions. this space
of solutions corresponds to a 3-dimensional space of n = 1 scfts. the general
arguments we used so far do not tell us the form of the 3-dimensional space, but we
can now use our analysis of the n = 4 theory to learn more about it. first, we know
that the n = 4 line g = h3, h1 = h2 = 0 is a subspace of this 3-dimensional space. we
also know that at leading order in the deformation away from this subspace, (h3 + g),
h1 and h2 correspond to marginal operators (as described above they couple to chiral
operators of dimension 4), while (h3  g) couples to a non-chiral operator (in the 15
of su(4)r) whose dimension is corrected away from g = 0 (and seems to be large for
large g2
y m n). thus, we see that to leading order in the deformation around the n = 4
xed line, the exactly marginal deformations are given by h1 and h2 (which are two
particular elements of the 100 representation). it is not known if the other deformations
in the 45 are marginally relevant, marginally irrelevant or exactly marginal.

4.3.4 deformations of string theory on ads5  s5

as described in section 4.3.1, to analyze the deformations of section 4.3.3 in the ads
context requires nding solutions of string theory with appropriate boundary condi-
tions. for the exactly marginal deformation in the 1, which corresponds to the dilaton,
we already know the solutions, which are just the ads5  s5 solution with any value of
the string coupling iib. the other operators discussed above are identied in string
theory with particular modes of the 2-form eld bab with indices in the s5 direc-
tions (we view b as a complex 2-form eld which contains both the ns-ns and r-r
2-form elds). thus, the dimension 3 mass deformation would be related to string the-
ory backgrounds in which bab(x, u, y) u my (1)
ab (y)/u for some spherical harmonics
y (1)
ab (y) on s5, and the dimension 4 deformations would be related to backgrounds with

144

bab(x, u, y) u hy (2)
ab (y). it is clear from the identication of the superconformal al-
gebra in the eld theory and in the string theory that these deformations break the
same supersymmetries in both cases; this can also be checked explicitly (say, to leading
order in the deformation [406, 145]) by analyzing the susy variations of the type iib
supergravity elds. the existence of an exactly marginal deformation breaking the
n = 4 superconformal symmetry to n = 1 superconformal symmetry suggests that
the theorem of [426], that forbids at space compactications with dierent amounts
of supersymmetry from being at a nite distance from each other in the string theory
moduli space, is not valid in ads compactications [406, 145].

since we know little about string theory in backgrounds with rr elds, our analysis
of such solutions is eectively limited to the supergravity approximation. this already
limits our discussion to large  = gsn, and it limits it further to cases where the
solution does not develop large curvatures in the interior. in the supergravity limit one
would want to nd solutions of type iib supergravity with the boundary conditions
described above (with the rest of the elds having the same boundary conditions as in
the ads5  s5 case). unfortunately, no such solutions are known, and they seem to
be rather dicult to construct. there are 3 possible approaches to circumventing this
problem of nding exact solutions to type iib supergravity :

 one can try to construct solutions perturbatively in the deformation parameter,
which should be easier than constructing the full exact solution. unfortunately,
this approach does not make sense for the relevant deformations, since already
at leading order in the deformation (corresponding to the linearized equations of
motion around the ads5  s5 solution) we nd that the solution (bab  1/u)
grows to be very large in the interior, so the perturbative expansion does not make
sense. at best one may hope to have a perturbative expansion in a parameter
like m/u (if m is the coecient of a relevant operator of dimension  = 3),
but this only makes sense near the boundary. on the other hand, for marginal
deformations, and especially for deformations that are supposed to be exactly
marginal, this approach makes sense. exactly marginal deformations correspond
to solutions which do not depend on the ads coordinates at all, so a perturbation
expansion in the parameters of the deformation seems to be well-dened.
in
practice such a perturbation expansion is quite complicated, and can only be
done in the rst few orders in the deformation. in the case of the deformation by
h1, h2 which was described in eld theory above, one can verify that it is an exactly
marginal deformation to second order in the deformation, even though additional
sugra elds need to be turned on at this order (including components of the
metric with s5 indices). this is in fact true for any deformation in the 45. at
third order one probably gets non-trivial constraints on which elements of the 45
one can be turned on in an exactly marginal deformation, but the equations of

145

motion of type iib sugra have not yet been expanded to this order. verifying
that the deformations that are exactly marginal in the eld theory correspond
to exactly marginal deformations also in string theory on ads5  s5 would be a
non-trivial test of the ads/cft correspondence.

 there are no known non-trivial solutions of type iib supergravity which are
asymptotically of the form described above for the relevant or marginal deforma-
tions. however, there are several known solutions [171, 119] of type iib super-
gravity (in addition to the ads5  s5 solution) which involve ads5 spaces and
have so(4, 2) isometries (these solutions need not necessarily be direct products
ads5  x), and one can try to guess that they would be the end-points of ows
arising from relevant deformations. as long as we are in the supergravity ap-
proximation, only solutions which are topologically equivalent to ads5  s5 can
be related by ows to the ads5  s5 solution, so we will not discuss here other
types of ads5 solutions.
one such solution was found in [171], which is of the form ads5  x, where x is
an s1 ber over cp 2 (a stretched ve-sphere), and there is also a 3-form eld
turned on in the compact directions (this is called a pope-warner type solution
[427]). this solution has an su(3) isometry symmetry (corresponding to an
su(3) global symmetry in the corresponding eld theory), and it breaks all the
supersymmetries. thus, it is natural to try to identify it with the deformation
by the non-supersymmetric single-fermion mass operator described in section
4.3.3, which has the same symmetries. additional evidence for this identication
will be presented below. this classical supergravity solution, like all type iib
supergravity solutions, has the dilaton as an arbitrary parameter, corresponding
to a xed line in the corresponding eld theory. however, for nite n one would
expect quantum corrections in this non-supersymmetric background to generate a
potential for the dilaton (as well as for any other massless scalar elds if they exist
in this compactication), which should have a unique vacuum to correspond with
the eld theory expectations described above. for innite n this correspondence
would predict a xed line in the corresponding eld theory, but it is not clear
how to analyze this directly in the eld theory (perturbation theory is not valid
since the eld theory, which is the ir limit of qcd with three adjoint fermions,
is always strongly coupled, so if there is a xed line it does not pass through weak
coupling). we will discuss this solution further below.

an additional solution, found in [119], exhibits an so(5) global symmetry. how-
ever, as discussed below, this solution appears to be unstable.

 the most successful way (to date) of analyzing the appropriate solutions of type
iib supergravity has been to restrict attention to the ve dimensional n = 8

146

supergravity [122] sector of the theory, which includes only the n = 2 super-
graviton multiplet from the spectrum described in section 3.2.1. unlike the sit-
uation in at-space compactications, the ve dimensional supergravity cannot
be viewed as a low-energy limit of the ten dimensional supergravity compacti-
cation in any sense. for instance, the supergraviton multiplet contains elds of
m2 = 4/r2, while other multiplets (in the n = 3, 4 multiplets) which are not
included in the truncation to the ve dimensional supergravity theory involve
massless elds on ads5. however, it is conjectured that there does exist a con-
sistent truncation of the type iib supergravity theory on ads5  s5 to the ve
dimensional n = 8 supergravity, in the sense that every solution of the latter can
be mapped into a solution of the full type iib theory (with the other elds in type
iib supergravity being some functions of the ve dimensional sugra elds). a
similar truncation is believed to exist ([138, 112] and references therein) for the
relation between 11 dimensional supergravity compactied on ads4 s7 and the
four dimensional n = 8 gauged supergravity, and for the relation between 11
dimensional supergravity compactied on ads7  s4 and the seven dimensional
gauged supergravity, and the similarities between the two cases suggest that it
may exist also in the ads5  s5 case (though this has not yet been proven18).
in the rest of this section we will assume that such a truncation exists and see
what we can learn from it. obviously, we can only learn from such a truncation
about deformations of the theory by elds in the n = 2 multiplet, so we cannot
analyze the marginal deformations in the 45 in this way.
the rst thing one can try to do with the ve dimensional n = 8 supergravity
is to nd solutions to the equations of motion with an so(4, 2) isometry. these
correspond to critical points of the scalar potential of d = 5,n = 8 supergravity,
which is a complicated function of the 42 (=20 + 10c + 1c) scalar elds in the
n = 2 multiplet. a full analysis of the critical points of this potential has not
yet been performed, but there are 4 known vacua in addition to the vacuum
corresponding to ads5  s5 :
(i) there is a non-supersymmetric vacuum with an unbroken su(3) gauge group.
this vacuum is conjectured to correspond to the su(3)-invariant vacuum of the
full type iib supergravity theory described above, which, as mentioned above,
could correspond to a mass deformation of the n = 4 eld theory. additional
evidence for this correspondence was presented in [145, 144], which constructed
a solution of the ve dimensional n = 8 supergravity which interpolates be-
tween the ads5  s5 solution and the su(3)-invariant solution, with the leading
deformation from the ads5  s5 solution corresponding exactly to the mass

18partial evidence for this was given in [141].

147

operator in the 16 in the decomposition 10 = 62 + 32 + 16, which breaks
su(4)r  su(3).
if indeed there is a consistent truncation of the type iib
supergravity to 5d n = 8 sugra then this is convincing evidence that the
su(3) invariant solution indeed corresponds (in the large n limit) to the xed
point arising from the single-fermion-mass deformation of the n = 4 eld theory.
since this solution is non-supersymmetric, one must verify that the classical solu-
tion is stable, namely that it does not contain tachyons whose mass is below the
breitenlohner-freedman stability bound (in supersymmetric vacua this is guar-
anteed; using equation (3.14), such tachyons would correspond to operators of
complex dimension in the eld theory which would contradict its unitarity). in
[144] it was veried that this is true for the elds of the ve dimensional super-
gravity multiplet; it would be interesting to verify this for the full spectrum of
the type iib supergravity theory, to conrm that the solution indeed describes a
consistent supergravity compactication. the central charge of the correspond-
ing eld theory was computed in [146] and found to be smaller than that of the
uv n = 4 xed point, consistent with the conjectured c-theorem. as discussed
above, the supergravity solution contains a massless scalar (the dilaton) which
is expected to obtain a non-trivial potential when the quantum corrections are
included. it is not clear how to analyze these corrections and to check whether
after their inclusion there is still a consistent vacuum of string theory on the cor-
responding manifold or not. presumably, if such a consistent vacuum exists, it
would not be a weakly coupled string theory (since it is unlikely that the dilaton
can be stabilized at weak coupling). however, it could still have small curvatures
(in the large n limit), so that a supergravity analysis of this theory may be use-
ful. if the dilaton does not stabilize in the small curvature region one would need
to go beyond the supergravity approximation to learn anything about the the-
ory, and in particular to learn whether there is any stable ads-type background
(corresponding to an ir xed point in the eld theory) or not (corresponding to
connement in the eld theory).

(ii) there is a non-supersymmetric vacuum with unbroken so(5) gauge symme-
try, which is conjectured to be related to the so(5)-invariant compactication
of type iib supergravity which we mentioned above. the mass spectrum in this
vacuum was computed in [144], where it was found that it has a tachyonic particle
whose mass is below the stability bound. thus, even classically this is not really
a vacuum of the supergravity theory (presumably the tachyon would condense
and the theory would ow to some dierent vacuum). it was found in [145, 144]
that this vacuum is related to the ads5  s5 vacuum by a deformation involv-
ing turning on one of the operators in the 20 representation; presumably the
instability of the supergravity solution is related to the instability of the eld

148

theory after performing this deformation.
(iii) there is [146, 407, 143] a vacuum with su(2)  u(1) unbroken symmetry
and 8 unbroken supercharges, corresponding to an n = 1 scft in the eld
theory. there is no known corresponding solution of the full type iib theory,
but assuming that 5d sugra is a consistent truncation, such a solution must
exist (though it is not guaranteed that all its curvature invariants will be small,
as required for the consistency of the supergravity approximation). it is natural
to identify this vacuum with the ir xed point arising from the supersymmetric
single-chiral-supereld mass deformation described in section 4.3.3. this is con-
sistent with the form of the 5d sugra elds that are turned on in this solution,
with the global symmetries of the solution, and with the fact that on both sides
of the correspondence we have a xed line of n = 1 scfts (the parameter h of
the xed line corresponds to the dilaton on the string theory side; supersymmetry
prohibits the generation of a potential for this eld). recently this identication
was supported by the construction of the full solution interpolating between the
n = 4 xed point and the n = 1 xed point in the 5d sugra theory [143].
since we have some supersymmetry left in this case, one can also quantitatively
test this correspondence by matching the global anomalies of the eld theory
described in section 4.3.3 (the su(n) n = 1 sqcd theory with two adjoint
chiral multiplets and a superpotential w  tr([2, 3]2)) with those of the cor-
responding sugra background, as described in section 3.2.2. the conformal
anomalies were successfully compared in [407, 143] in the large n limit, giving
some evidence for this correspondence (in particular, the conformal anomalies of
this theory satisfy a = c, as required for a consistent supergravity approxima-
tion). the fact that the central charge corresponding to this solution is smaller
than that of the ads5  s5 solution with the same rr 5-form ux (note that
the rr ux is quantized and does not change when we deform) means that this
interpretation is consistent with the conjectured four dimensional c-theorem.
(iv) there is an additional background found in [146] with su(2)  u(1)  u(1)
unbroken gauge symmetry and no supersymmetry. the mass spectrum of this
background has not yet been computed, so it is not clear if it is stable or not.
the sugra solution involves giving vevs to elds both in the 20 and in the
10, but it is not clear exactly what deformation of the original ads5  s5 theory
(if any) this background corresponds to.

in principle, one could also use the truncated ve dimensional theory to analyze
other relevant deformations in the 10, which are not expected to give rise to
conformal eld theories in the ir. presumably most of them would lead to high
curvatures in the interior, but perhaps some of them do not and can then be
analyzed purely in supergravity.

149

to summarize, the analysis of deformations in string theory on ads5  s5 is rather
dicult, but the results that are known so far seem to be consistent with the ads/cft
correspondence. the only known results correspond to deformations which lead to con-
formal theories in the ir; as discussed in section 4.3.3, these are also the only deforma-
tions which we would expect to be able to usefully study in general in the supergravity
approximation. the most concretely analyzed deformation is the single-chiral-fermion
mass deformation, which seems to lead to another ads-type background of type iib
supergravity (though only the truncation of this background to the ve dimensional
supergravity is known so far). in non-supersymmetric cases the analysis of deforma-
tions is complicated (see, for instance, [327]) by the fact that quantum corrections are
presumably important in lifting at directions, so a classical supergravity analysis is
not really enough and the full string theory seems to be needed.

chapter 5

ads3

in this chapter we will study the relation between gravity theories (string theories)
on ads3 and two dimensional conformal eld theories. first we are going to describe
some generalities which are valid for any ads3 quantum gravity theory, and then we
will discuss in more detail iib string theory compactied on ads3  s3  m 4 with
m 4 = k3 or t 4.

ads3 quantum gravity is conjectured to be dual to a two dimensional conformal eld
theory which can be thought of as living on the boundary of ads3. the boundary of
ads3 (in global coordinates) is a cylinder, so the conformal eld theory is dened on
this cylinder. we choose the cylinder to have radius one, which is the usual convention
for conformal eld theories. of course, all circles are equivalent since this is a conformal
eld theory, but we have to rescale energies accordingly. if the spacetime theory or
the conformal eld theory contain fermions then they have anti-periodic boundary
conditions on the circle. the reason is that the circle is contractible in ads3, and close
to the center of ads3 a translation by 2 on the circle looks like a rotation by 2,
and fermions get a minus sign. so, the dual conformal eld theory is in the ns-ns
sector. note that we will not sum over sectors as we do in string theory, since in this
case the conformal eld theory describes string theory on the given spacetime and all
its nite energy excitations, and we do not have to second-quantize it.

5.1 the virasoro algebra

the isometry group of ads3 is sl(2, r) sl(2, r), or so(2, 2). the conformal group
in two dimensions is innite. this seems to be, at rst sight, a contradiction, since in
our previous discussion we identied the conformal group with the isometry group of
ads. however, out of the innite set of generators only an sl(2, r)  sl(2, r) sub-
group leaves the vacuum invariant. the vacuum corresponds to empty ads3, and this

151

subgroup corresponds to the group of isometries of ads3. the other generators map
the vacuum into some excited states. so, we expect to nd that the other generators of
the conformal group map empty ads3 into ads3 with (for instance) a graviton inside.
these other generators are associated to reparametrizations that leave the asymptotic
form of ads3 invariant at innity. this problem was analyzed in detail in [428] and
we will just sketch the argument here. the metric on ads3 can be written as

ds2 = r2( cosh2 d 2 + sinh2 d2 + d2).

(5.1)

when  is large (close to the boundary) this is approximately

ds2  r2he2d +d + d2i ,

(5.2)
where     . an innitesimal reparametrization generated by a general vector
eld (, , ) changes the metric by g  g + +. if we want to preserve
the asymptotic form of the metric (5.2), we require that [428]

where f ( +) and g() are arbitrary functions. expanding the functions f =p lnen +,
g = p lnen 
, we recognize the virasoro generators ln, ln. for the cases n = 0,1
one can nd some isometries that reduce to (5.3) at innity, are globally dened, and
leave the metric invariant. these are the so(2, 2) isometries discussed above. for the
other generators it is possible to nd a globally dened vector eld , but it does not
leave the metric invariant.

it is possible to calculate the classical poisson brackets among these generators, and

one nds that this classical algebra has a central charge which is equal to [428]

c =

(5.4)

where g(3)
n is the three dimensional newton constant. so, this should also be the
central charge of the dual conformal eld theory, since (5.3) implies that these virasoro
generators are acting on the boundary as the virasoro generators of a 1+1 dimensional
conformal eld theory.

a simple calculation of the central charge term (5.4) was given in [223]. under a

so, comparing (5.7) with (5.6) we can calculate the central charge (5.4).

it is also possible to show that if we have boundary conditions on the metric at
innity that in the dual conformal eld theory correspond to considering the theory
on a curved geometry, then we get the right conformal anomaly [221] (generalizing the
discussion in section 3.2.2).

5.2 the btz black hole

three dimensional gravity has no propagating degrees of freedom. but, if we have a
negative cosmological constant, we can have black hole solutions. they are given by

where we are measuring the mass relative to the ads3 space, which we dene to have
m = 0 (the scale of the mass is set by the radius of the circle in the dual cft). this
is not the usual convention, but it is much more natural in this context since we are

153

hole is always at least

the black hole with this minimum mass (sometimes called the zero mass black hole)
has a singularity at r = r+ = r = 0. all these black holes are locally the same as ads3
but they dier by some global identications [429, 430], i.e. they are quotients of ads3.
in theories that have supersymmetry it can be checked that the zero mass black hole
preserves some supersymmetries provided that we make the fermions periodic as we go
around the circle [431], which is something we have the freedom to do once the circle
is not contractible in the gravity geometry. these supersymmetries commute with the
hamiltonian conjugate to t. furthermore, we will see below that if we consider the near
horizon geometry of branes wrapped on a circle with periodic boundary conditions for
the spinors, we naturally obtain the btz black hole with mass mmin. this leads us
to identify the m = mmin btz black hole with the rr vacuum of the conformal eld
theory [431]. the energy mmin (5.11) is precisely the energy dierence between the ns-
ns vacuum and the rr vacuum. of course, we could still have the m = mmin btz
black hole with anti-periodic boundary conditions as an excited state in the ns-ns
sector.

next, let us calculate the black hole entropy. the bekenstein-hawking entropy

formula gives

s =

4g(3)
n

=

2r+
4g(3)
n

=

2c

(t+ + t),

(5.12)

where we used (5.4). we can also calculate this in the conformal eld theory. all we
need is the central charge of the conformal eld theory, which we argued had to be
(5.4). then, we can use the general formula [432] for the growth of states in a unitary
conformal eld theory [433, 270], which gives

2c
3

s 

(t+ + t).

(5.13)

thus, we see that the two results agree. this result if valid for a general conformal
eld theory as long as we are in the asymptotic high energy regime (where energies
are measured in units of the radius of the circle), so in particular we need that t  1.
when is the result (5.12) valid? in principle we would say that it is valid as long as
the area of the horizon is much bigger than the planck length, r+  g(3)
n . this gives
t  1/c, which is a much weaker bound on the temperature for large c. so, we see
that the corresponding conformal eld theory has to be quite special, since the number
of states should grow as determined by the asymptotics (5.13) for energies that are
much smaller than one would expect for a generic conformal eld theory.

figure 5.1: calculation of the partition function at nite temperature through the
euclidean conformal eld theory. since the two directions are equivalent we can choose
the time direction as we wish. the partition function is dual under   42/.
(a) at low temperatures  is large and only the vacuum propagates in the  direction.
(b) at high temperatures, small , only the crossed channel vacuum propagates in the
 direction. (c) when  = 2 we have a sharp transition according to supergravity.

a related manifestation of this curious feature of the boundary conformal eld
theory is the following. we could consider the canonical ensemble by going to euclidean
space and making the euclidean time coordinate periodic,  =  + . we consider the
case  = 0, the general case is considered in [270]. the conformal eld theory is then
dened on a rectangular two-torus, and the free energy will be the partition function
of the theory on this two-torus. due to the thermal boundary condition in the ns
sector, the two-torus ends up having ns-ns boundary conditions on both circles. in
order to calculate the partition function in the dual gravitational theory we should nd
a three-manifold that has the two-torus as its boundary (the correspondence tells us
to sum over all such manifolds). one possibility is to have the original ads3 space
but with time identied,  =  + . the value of the free energy is then given, to
leading order, by the ground state energy of ads3. this is the expected result for
large , where the torus is very elongated and only the vacuum propagates in the 
channel, see gure 5.1(a). for high temperatures, only the vacuum propagates in the
crossed channel (g. 5.1(b)), and this corresponds to the btz black hole in ads3.
note that the euclidean btz geometry is the same as ads3 but on its side, with
  , so now the  circle is contractible. the transition between the two regimes
occurs at  = 2, which corresponds to a square torus (g. 5.1(c)). this is a sharp
transition when the gravity approximation is correct, i.e. when r/g(3)
n  c  1. this
sharp transition will not be present in the partition function of a generic conformal
eld theory, for example it is not present if we consider c free bosons. when we discuss

155

in more detail the conformal eld theories that correspond to string theory on ads3,
we will see that they have a feature that makes it possible to explain this transition.
this sharp transition is the two dimensional version of the large n phase transition
discussed in section 3.6.2 [182] (in this case c plays the role of n).

5.3 type iib string theory on ads3  s3  m 4
in this section we study iib string theory on ads3  s3  m 4 [270, 434]. throughout
this section m 4 = k3 or t 4. in this case we can get some insight on the dual confor-
mal eld theory by deriving this duality from d-branes, as we did for the ads5  s5
case. we start with type iib string theory on m 4. we consider a set of q1 d1
branes along a non-compact direction, and q5 d5 branes wrapping m 4 and sharing
the non-compact direction with the d1 branes. all the branes are coincident in the
transverse non-compact directions. the unbroken lorentz symmetry of this congura-
tion is so(1, 1)  so(4). so(1, 1) corresponds to boosts along the string, and so(4)
is the group of rotations in the four non-compact directions transverse to both branes.
this conguration also preserves eight supersymmetries, actually n = (4, 4) super-
symmetry once we decompose them into left and right moving spinors of so(1, 1)1.
it is possible to nd the supergravity solution for this conguration (see [435] for a
review) and then take the near horizon limit as we did in section 3.1 [5], and we get
the metric (in string frame)

ads = r2

this is ads3  s3 with radius r2 = r2
s, where g6 is the
six dimensional string coupling. the full ten dimensional geometry also includes an
m 4 factor.
in this case the volume of the m 4 factor in the near-horizon geometry
is proportional to q1/q5, and it is independent of the volume of the original m 4
over which we wrapped the branes. in the full d1-d5 geometry, which includes the
asymptotically at region, the volume of m 4 varies, and it is equal to the above xed
value in the near horizon region [436, 437, 438, 439].

5.3.1 the conformal field theory

the dual conformal eld theory is the low energy eld theory living on the d1-d5
system [440]. one of the properties of this conformal eld theory that we will need

1if m 4 = k3 we need that the sign of the d1 brane charge and the sign of the d5 brane charge
are the same, otherwise we break supersymmetry (except for the single conguration with charges
(q5, q1) = (1,1)).

156

is its central charge, so that we will be able to compare it with supergravity. we can
calculate this central charge in a way that is not too dependent on the precise structure
of the conformal eld theory. the conformal eld theory that we are interested in is
the ir xed point of the eld theory living on d1-d5 branes. the eld theory living
on d1-d5 branes, before we go to the ir xed point, is some 1 + 1 dimensional eld
theory with n = (4, 4) supersymmetry. this amount of supersymmetry is equivalent to
n = 2 in four dimensions, so we can classify the multiplets in a similar fashion. there
is a vector multiplet and a hypermultiplet. in two dimensions both multiplets have the
same propagating degrees of freedom, four scalars and four fermions, but they have
dierent properties under the su(2)l  su(2)r global r-symmetry. under this group
the scalars in the hypermultiplets are in the trivial representation, while the scalars
in the vector multiplet are in the (2, 2). on the fermions these global symmetries
act chirally. the left moving vector multiplet fermions are in the (1, 2), and the left
moving hypermultiplet fermions are in the (2, 1). the right moving fermions have
similar properties with su(2)l  su(2)r. the theory can have a coulomb branch
where the scalars in the vector multiplets have expectation values, and a higgs branch
where the scalars in the hypermultiplets have expectation values.

from the spacetime origin of the supercharges it is clear that the su(2)l  su(2)r
global r-symmetry is the same as the so(4) symmetry of spatial rotations in the 4-
plane orthogonal to the d1-d5 system [441, 442, 443]. the vector multiplets describe
motion of the branes in the transverse directions, this is consistent with their so(4)
transformation properties. the vector multiplet expectation values should be zero
if we want the branes to be on top of each other. we have put quotation marks since
expectation values do not exist in a 1 + 1 dimensional eld theory. it is possible to
show that if q1 and q5 are coprime then, by turning on some of the m 4 moduli (more
precisely some ns b-elds), one can remove the coulomb branch altogether, forcing
the branes to be at the same point in the transverse directions [444, 332].

since the fermions transform chirally under su(2)l, this theory has a chiral anomaly.
the chiral anomaly for su(2)l is proportional to the number of left moving fermions
minus the number of right moving fermions that transform under this symmetry. the
t hooft anomaly matching conditions imply that this anomaly should be the same at
high and low energies [445]. at high energies (high compared to the ir xed point)
the anomaly is ka = nh  nv , the dierence between the number of vector multiplets
and hypermultiplets. let us now calculate this, starting with the t 4 case. on a
d1-d5 brane worldvolume there are massless excitations coming from (1,1) strings,
(5,5) strings and (1,5) (and (5,1)) strings. the (1,1) or (5,5) strings come from a
vector multiplet of an n = (8, 8) theory, which gives rise to both a vector multiplet
and a hypermultiplet of n = (4, 4) supersymmetry, so they do not contribute to the
anomaly. the massless modes of the (1,5) strings come only in hypermultiplets, and

157

they contribute to the anomaly with ka = q1q5. for the k3 case the analysis is similar.
the d5 branes are now wrapped on k3, so the (5,5) strings give rise only to a vector
multiplet. the dierence from the t 4 case comes from the fact that in the t 4 case
the (5,5) hypermultiplet came from wilson lines on the torus, and on k3 we do not
have one-cycles so we do not have wilson lines. on the vebrane worldvolume there
is (when it is wrapped on k3) an induced one-brane charge equal to qind
1 = q5. the
total d1 brane charge is equal to the sum of the charges carried by explicit d1 branes
and this negative induced charge, q1 = qind
[446]. therefore, the number of
d1 branes is really qd1
1 q5. so,
we conclude that the anomaly is ka = qd1
5 = q1q5, which in the end is the
same result as in the t 4 case. note that in order to calculate this anomaly we only
need to know the massless elds, since all massive elds live in larger representations
which are roughly like a vector multiplet plus a hypermultiplet, and therefore they do
not contribute to the anomaly.

1 = q1 + q5, and the number of (1,5) strings is qd1

1 q5  q2

1 + qd1
1

when we are on the higgs branch all the vectors become massive except for the center
of mass multiplet, which contains elds describing the overall motion of all the branes
in the four transverse directions. this is just a free multiplet, containing four scalar
elds. on the higgs branch, at the ir xed point, the su(2)l symmetry becomes a
current algebra with an anomaly kcf t. the total anomaly should be the same, so that
ka = kcf t1. the last term comes from the center of mass u(1) vector multiplet (which
is not included in kcf t). so, we conclude that kcf t = q1q5 + 1. since the u(1) vector
multiplet is decoupled, we drop it in the rest of the discussion and we talk only about
the conformal eld theory of the hypermultiplets. the n = (4, 4) superconformal
symmetry relates the anomaly in the su(2) current algebra to the central charge,
c = 6kcf t = 6(q1q5 + 1). using the value for the ads3 radius r = (g2
6q1q5)1/4ls and
the three dimensional newton constant g(3)
s/4r3, we can now check that (5.4)
is satised to leading order for large k. this also ensures, as we saw above, that the
black hole entropy comes out right.

n = g2

6l4

now we will try to describe this conformal eld theory a bit more explicitly. we start
with q5 d5 branes, and we view the d1 branes as instantons of the low-energy sym
theory on the ve-branes [158]. these instantons live on m 4 and are translationally
invariant (actually also so(1, 1) invariant) along time and the x5 direction, where x5
is the non compact direction along the d5 branes. see gure 5.2(a). this instanton
conguration, with instanton number q1, has moduli, which are the parameters that
parameterize a continuous family of solutions (classical instanton congurations). all
of these solutions have the same energy. small uctuations of this conguration (at
low energies) are described by uctuations of the instanton moduli. these moduli
can uctuate in time as well as in the x5 direction. see gure 5.2(b). so, the low
energy dynamics is given by a 1 + 1 dimensional sigma model whose target space is the

(b) the instanton moduli can oscillate in time and along x5.

instanton moduli space. let us be slightly more explicit, and choose four coordinates
x6, ..., x9 parameterizing m 4. the instantons are described in the uv sym theory as
su(q5) gauge elds a6,7,8,9(a; x6, ..., x9) with eld strengths which satisfy f = 4f ,
where 4 is the epsilon symbol in m 4 and a are the moduli parameterizing the family of
instantons. the dimension of the instanton moduli space for q1 instantons in su(q5)
is 4k, where

k  q1q5

for t 4,

k  q1q5 + 1

for k3.

(5.15)

the leading behaviour for large q is the same. in the t 4 case we have four additional
moduli coming from the wilson lines of the u(1) factor of u(q5) [447]. it has been
argued in [443, 448] that the instanton moduli space is a deformation of the symmetric
product of k copies of m 4, sym(m 4)k  (m 4)k/sk. the deformation involves blowing
up the xed points of the orbifold, as well as modifying the b-elds that live at the
orbifold point. we will discuss this in more detail later. the parameter that blows
up the singularity can be identied with one of the supergravity moduli of this solu-
tion. for some particular value of these moduli (which are not to be confused with
the moduli of the instanton conguration) the cft will be precisely the symmetric
product, but at that point the gravity approximation will not be valid, since we will
see that the supergravity description predicts fewer states at low conformal weights
than the symmetric product cft. when we deform the symmetric product, some of
the states can get large corrections and have high energies (i.e. they correspond to
operators having high conformal weight). other studies of this d1-d5 system include
[449, 450, 451]

5.3.2 black holes revisited

we remarked above that the btz black hole entropy can be calculated just from the
value of the central charge, and therefore the gravity result agrees with the conformal
eld theory result. note that the calculation of the central charge that we did above
in the cft is valid for any value of the coupling (i.e. the moduli), so the eld theory
calculation of the central charge and the entropy is valid also in the black hole regime
(where the gravity approximation is valid). this should be contrasted to the ads5s5
case, where the eld theory calculation of the entropy was only done at weak coupling
(in two dimensions the entropy is determined by the central charge and cannot change
as we vary moduli). in [452] corrections to the central charge in the gravity picture
were analyzed.

we noticed above that the gravity description predicted a sharp phase transition
when the temperature was t = 1/(2), and we remarked that the eld theory had to
have some special properties to make this happen. we will now explain qualitatively
this phase transition. our discussion will be qualitative because we will work at the
orbifold point, and this is not correct if we are in the supergravity regime. we will
see that the symmetric product has a feature that makes this sharp phase transition
possible.

the orbifold theory can be interpreted in terms of a gas of strings [453, 454]. these
are strings that wind along x5 and move on m 4. the total winding number is k. the
strings can be singly wound or multiply wound. in the r-r sector it does not cost any
energy to multiply wind the strings. if we have ns-ns boundary conditions, which
are the appropriate ones to describe ads3, it will cost some energy to multiply wind
the strings. the energy cost in the orbifold cft is the same as twice the conformal
weight of the corresponding twist operator, which is h = h = w/4 + o(1/w) for a
conguration with winding number w. if the strings are singly wound and we have a
temperature of order one (or 1/2), we will not have many oscillation modes excited
on these strings, and the entropy will be small. note that the fact that we have
many singly wound strings does not help, since we are supposed to symmetrize over
all strings, so most of the strings will be in similar states and they will not contribute
much to the entropy. so, the free energy of such a state is basically f  0. on
the other hand, if we multiply wind all the strings, we raise the energy of the system
but we also increase the entropy [455], since now the energy gap of the system will
be much lower (the multiply wound strings behave eectively like a eld theory on
a circle with a radius which is w times bigger). if we multiply wind w strings, with
w  1, we get an energy e  w/2 + 22wt 2, where the last term comes from thermal
excitations along the string. the entropy is also larger, s = 42wt . so, the free
energy is f = e  t s = w/2 22wt 2. comparing this to the free energy of the state

160

with all strings singly wound, we see that the latter wins when t < 1/(2), and the
multiply wound state wins when t > 1/(2). this explains the presence of the sharp
phase transition at t = 1/(2) when we are at the orbifold point.

note that the mass of the black hole at the transition point is m = mmin + k/2,
which is (for large k) much bigger than the minimum mass for a btz black hole, like
the situation in other adsd>3. we could have black holes which are smaller than this,
but they cannot be in thermal equilibrium with an external bath. of course they could
be in equilibrium inside ads3 if we do not couple ads3 to an external bath to keep the
temperature nite. in this case we are considering the microcanonical ensemble, and
there are more black hole solutions that we could be considering [271, 276, 279].

strings and one doubly wound string. (b) a maximally multiply wound conguration.

if we were considering the conformal eld theory on a circle with rr boundary
conditions, the corresponding supergravity background would be the m = mmin btz
black hole. this follows from the fact that we should have preserved supersymmetries
that commute with the hamiltonian (in ads3 the preserved supersymmetries do not
commute with the hamiltonian generating evolution in global time). in order to have
these supersymmetries we need to have rr boundary conditions on the circle. notice
that the rr vacuum is not an excited state on the ns-ns vacuum, it is just in a
dierent sector of the conformal eld theory, even though the m = mmin btz black
hole appears in both sectors.

in the case with rr boundary conditions a black hole forms as soon as we raise
the temperature (beyond t  1/k). this seems at rst sight paradoxical, since the
temperature could be much smaller than one, which would be the natural energy gap
for a generic conformal eld theory on a circle. the reason that the energy gap is very
small for this conformal eld theory is due to the presence of long, multiply wound
strings. in the rr sector all multiply wound strings have the same energy. but, as we

161

saw before, multiply wound strings lead to higher entropy states so they are preferred.
in fact, one can estimate the energy gap of the system by saying that it will be of
the order of the minimum energy excitation that can exist on a string multiply wound
k-times, which is of the order of 1/k. this estimate of the energy gap agrees with a
semiclassical estimate as follows. we can trust the thermodynamic approximation for
black holes as long as the specic heat is large enough [456]. for any system we need
a large specic heat, ce  e
t , in order to trust the thermodynamic approximation. in
this case e  kt 2, so the condition ce  1 boils down to e  1/k . so, this estimate
of the energy gap agrees with the conformal eld theory estimate. note that in the rr
supergravity vacuum (the m = mmin black hole) we could seemingly have arbitrarily
low energy excitations as waves propagating on this space. the boundary condition on
these waves at the singularity should be such that one gets the above gap, but in the
gravity approximation k =  and this gap is not seen. note also that the m = mmin
black hole does not correspond to a single state (as opposed to the ads3 vacuum), but
to a large number of states, of the order of e22k for t 4 case and e24k for k32.

there are other black holes that preserve some supersymmetries, which are extremal
btz black holes with m  mmin = j [431]. j is the angular momentum in ads3,
identied with the momentum along the s1 in the cft. of course, these black holes
will preserve supersymmetry only if the boundary conditions on s1 are periodic, i.e.
only if we are considering the rr sector of the theory. in the rr sector it becomes more
natural to measure energies so that the rr vacuum has zero energy. the extremal
black holes correspond to states in the cft in the rr sector with no left moving
energy, l0 = 0, and some right moving energy, l0 = j > 0. the entropy of these
states is

s = 2kj.

(5.16)

this is the entropy as long as kl0 is large, even for l0 = 1. the reason for this is again
the presence of multiply wound strings, that ensure that the asymptotic formula for
the number of states in a conformal eld theory is reached at very low values of l0. in
this argument it is important that we are in the rr sector, and since we are counting
bps states we can deform the theory until we are at the symmetric product point, and
then the argument we gave in terms of multiply wound strings is rigorous [12, 447].

it is possible to consider also black holes which carry angular momentum on s3.
they are characterized by the eigenvalues jl, jr, of j 3
r of su(2)l  su(2)r.
these rotating black holes can be found by taking the near horizon limit of rotating
black strings in six dimensions [457, 458]. their metric is locally ads3  s3 but with
some discrete identications [459]. cosmic censorship implies that their mass has a

l and j 3

2an easy way to calculate this number of bps states is to consider this conguration as a system
of d1-d5 branes on s1  m 4 and then do a u-duality transformation, transforming this into a system
of fundamental string momentum and winding.

we can understand this formula in the following way [460, 441]. if we bosonize the
u(1) currents, jl  k
2 , and similarly for jr, we can construct the operator eijl
with conformal weight j 2
l/k. this explains why the minimum mass is (5.17). this also
explains (5.18), since only a portion of the energy equal to l0j 2
l/k
can be distributed freely among the oscillators3.

l/k = (e+j)/2j 2

5.3.3 matching of chiral-chiral primaries

the cft we are discussing here, and also its string theory dual, have moduli (param-
eters of the eld theory). at some point in the moduli space the symmetric product
description is valid, and at that point the gravity description is strongly coupled and
cannot be trusted. as we move away from that point we can get to regions in moduli
space where we can trust the gravity description. the energies of most states will
change when we change the moduli. there are, however, states that are protected,
whose energies are not changed. these are chiral primary states [462]. the supercon-
formal algebra contains terms of the form4

where qr = (q
2. the generators that belong to the global
supergroup (which leaves the vacuum and ads3 invariant) have r, s = 1/2. the rst
superscript indicates the eigenvalues under the global j 3
0 generator of su(2), and the
second superscript corresponds to a global su(2) exterior automorphism of the algebra
which is not associated to a symmetry in the theory. if we take a state |hi which has
l0 = j 3
1/2|hi has zero norm, so in a unitary eld
theory it should be zero. thus, these states are annihilated by q+
1/2. moreover, if
a state is annihilated by q+
0 . these states are called right chiral
primaries, and if l0 = j 3

1/2 then l0 = j 3

3other black holes were studied in [461].
4our normalization for j 3

0 follows the standard su (2) practice and diers by a factor of two from

the u(1) current in [462, 270, 434, 463].

163

primaries are bounded by j 3
0  c/6 = k. this can be seen by computing the norm of
q+
3/2|hi. note that k is the level of the su(2) current algebra. the values of j 3
0 for
generic states are not bounded. the spins of su(2) current algebra primary elds are
bounded by j 3

0  k/2, which is not the same as the bound on chiral primaries.

let us now discuss the structure of the supermultiplets under the su(1, 1|2) subgroup
of the n = 4 algebra [464]. this is the subgroup generated by the supercharges with
r, s = 1/2 in (5.19), plus the global su(2) generators j a
0 and the sl(2, r) subgroup
of the virasoro algebra. the structure of these multiplets is the following. by acting
with q1/2 on a state we lower its energy, which is the l0 eigenvalue. energies are all
positive in a unitary conformal eld theory, since l0 eigenvalues are related to scaling
dimensions of elds which should be positive. so, we conclude that at some point q1/2
will annihilate the state. such a state is also annihilated by l1 (5.19). we call such
a state a primary, or highest weight, state. then, we can generate all other states by
acting with q
1/2. see gure 5.4. this will give in general a set of 1 + 4 + 6 + 4 + 1
states, where we organized the states according to their level. on each of these states
we can then act with arbitrary powers of l1. however, we could also have a short
representation where some of the q1/2 operators annihilate the state. this will happen
when l0 = j 3
0 , i.e. only when we have a chiral primary (or an antichiral primary).
since by su(2) symmetry each chiral primary comes with an antichiral primary, we
concentrate on chiral primaries. these short multiplets are of the form

the multiplet includes four states (which are sl(2, r) primaries), except in the case
that j = 1/2 when the last state is missing. we get a similar structure if we consider
the right-moving part of the supergroup.

0 and l0 = j 3

0 , j 3

1/2 and q

0 . from now on we drop the indices on j 3

we will rst consider states that are left and right moving chiral primaries, with
l0 = j 3
0 , and denote the
chiral primaries by (j, j). by acting with q
1/2 we generate the whole
supermultiplet. we will calculate the spectrum of chiral-chiral primaries both in string
theory (in the gravity approximation) and in the conformal eld theory at the orbifold
point. since these states lie in short representations we might expect that they remain
in short representations also after we deform the theory away from the orbifold point.
actually this argument is not enough, since in principle short multiplets could combine
and become long multiplets. in the k3 case we can give a better argument. we will
see that all chiral primaries that appear are bosonic in nature, while we see from gure
5.4 that we need some bosonic and some fermionic chiral primaries to make a long
multiplet. therefore, all chiral primaries must remain for any value of the moduli.

figure 5.4: structure of su(1, 1|2) multiplets. we show the spectrum of possible js
and conformal weights. we show only the sl(2, r) primaries that appear in each
multiplet and their degeneracies. the minus sign denotes opposite statistics. the full
square is a long multiplet. the encircled states form a short multiplet. four short
multiplets can combine into a long multiplet.

let us start with the conformal eld theory. since these states are protected by
supersymmetry we can go to the orbifold point sym(m 4)k. the chiral primaries in
this case can be understood as follows. in a theory with n = (4, 4) supersymmetry we
can do calculations in the rr sector and then translate them into results about the ns-
ns sector. this process is called spectral ow, and it amounts to an automorphism
of the n = 4 algebra. under spectral ow, the chiral primaries of the ns-ns sector
(that we are interested in) are in one to one correspondence with the ground states
of the rr sector. it is easier to compute the properties of the rr ground states of
the theory. orbifold conformal eld theories, like sym(m 4)k, can be thought of as
describing a gas of strings winding on a circle, the circle where the cft is dened,
with total winding number k and moving on m 4. the ground state energies of a
singly wound string and a multiply wound string are the same if we are in the rr
sector. then, we can calculate a partition function over the rr ground states. it is
more convenient to relax the constraint on the total winding number by introducing
a chemical potential for the winding number, and then we can recover the result with
xed winding number by extracting the appropriate term in the partition function as in
[453]. since our conformal eld theory has xed k we will be implicitly assuming that
we are extracting the appropriate term from the partition function. the rr ground
states for the strings moving on m 4 are the same as the ground states of a quantum
mechanical supersymmetric sigma model on m 4. it was shown by witten [465] that

165

these are in one-to-one correspondence with the harmonic forms on m 4. let us denote
by hrs the number of harmonic forms of holomorphic degree r and antiholomorphic
degree s. states with degree r + s odd are fermionic, and states with r + s even are
bosonic. in the case of k3 h00 = h22 = h20 = h02 = 1 and h11 = 20. in the case of
t 4 h00 = h22 = h20 = h02 = 1, h01 = h10 = h12 = h21 = 2, and h11 = 4. a form with
degrees (r, s) gives rise to a state with angular momenta (j, j) = ((r  1)/2, (s 1)/2).
the partition function in the rr sector becomes [453]
xk0

pkt rsym(m 4)k [(1)2j+2 j yj y j] =

qn1qr,s(1  pny(r1)/2 y(s1)/2)(1)r+shrs

where the trace is over the ground states of the rr sector. spectral ow boils down
to the replacement p  py1/2 y1/2. thus, we get the ns-ns partition function, giving
a prediction for the chiral primaries,

where here the trace is over the chiral-chiral primaries in the ns-ns sector.

now, we should compare this with supergravity. in supergravity we start by cal-
culating the spectrum of single particle chiral-chiral primaries. we then calculate the
full spectrum by considering multiparticle states. each single particle state contributes
with a factor (1 yj yj)d(j,j) to the partition function, were d(j, j) is the total number
of single particle states with these spins. the supergravity spectrum was calculated in
[270, 466, 434]. the number of single particle states is given by

let us discuss some the particles appearing in (5.23) and (5.24) more explicitly. some
of them are special because they carry only left moving quantum numbers or only right
moving quantum numbers. for example, we have the (0, 1) and (1, 0) states that are
related to the su(2)l and su(2)r gauge elds on ads3. these su(2) symmetries
come from the so(4) isometries of the 3-sphere. these gauge elds have a chern-
simons action [467, 136] and they give rise to su(2) current algebras on the boundary
[22, 151]. the chiral primary in the current algebra is the operator j +
1, which has

166

1/2q+

the quantum numbers mentioned above. when we apply q
1/2 to this state
we get the left moving stress tensor. again, this should correspond to part of the
physical modes of gravity on ads3. pure gravity in three dimensions is a theory with
no local degrees of freedom. in fact, it is equivalent to an sl(2, r)  sl(2, r) chern-
simons theory [467, 468, 469, 470]. this gives rise to some physical degrees of freedom
living at the boundary. it was argued that we get a liouville theory at the boundary
[471, 472, 473, 474, 475], which includes a stress tensor operator. in the t 4 case we
also have some other special particles which correspond to fermion zero modes (1/2, 0)
and (0, 1/2). these fermion zero modes are the supersymmetric partners of the u(1)
currents associated to isometries of t 4. the six dimensional theory corresponding to
type iib string theory on t 4 has 16 vector elds transforming in the spinor of so(5, 5).
from the symmetric product we get only 8 currents (4l + 4r). the other eight are
presumably related to an extra copy of t 4 appearing in the cft due to the wilson
lines of the u(1) in u(q5) [447, 476].

besides these purely left-moving or purely right-moving modes, which are not so easy
to see in supergravity, all other states arise as local bulk excitations of supergravity
elds on ads3 and are clearly present. higher values of j typically correspond to
higher kaluza-klein modes of lower j elds. more precisely, we have n (1/2, 1/2)
states where n = h11 + 1 [270, 466, 434]. by applying qs, each of these states gives
rise to four su(2)-neutral scalar elds, which have conformal weights h = h = 1.
therefore, they correspond to massless elds in spacetime by (3.14). these are the 4n
moduli of the supergravity compactication, which are identied with the moduli of
the conformal eld theory. in the conformal eld theory 4h11 of them correspond to
deformations of each copy of m 4 in the symmetric product, while the extra four are
associated to a blowup mode, the blowup mode of the z2 singularity that arises when
we exchange two copies of m 4. next, we have n + 1 elds with quantum numbers
(1, 1), n of these are higher order kaluza klein modes of the n elds we had before,
and the new one corresponds to deformations of the s3. each of these states gives rise
to su(2)-neutral elds with positive mass, since we have to apply qs twice and we get
h = h = 2. these are the n xed scalars of the supergravity background plus one more
eld related to changing the size of the s3. the elds with j, js above these values
are just higher kaluza klein modes of the elds we have already mentioned explicitly.
see [270, 466, 434] for a more systematic treatment and derivation of these results.

now, we want to compare the supergravity result with the gauge theory results.
in (5.22) there is an exclusion principle since the total power of p has to be pk,
thus limiting the total number of particles. in supergravity (5.24) we do not have any
indication of this exclusion principle. even if we did not know about the conformal
eld theory, from the fact that there is an n = 4 superconformal spacetime symmetry
we get a bound on the angular momentum of the chiral primaries j  k. however, this

167

bound is less restrictive than implied by (5.22). there are multi-particle states with
j < k that are excluded from (5.22). the bounds from (5.22) appear for very large
angular momenta and, therefore, very large energies, where we would not necessarily
trust the gravity approximation.
in fact, the gravity result and the conformal eld
theory result match precisely, as long as the conformal weight or spin of the chiral
primaries is j, j  k/2. one can show that the gravity description exactly matches
the k   limit of (5.22) [434]. this limit is extracted from (5.22) by noticing that
there is a factor of (1 p) in the denominator, which is related to the identity operator.
so, we can extract the k   limit by multiplying (5.22) by (1  p) and setting
p  1.
in principle, we could get precise agreement between the conformal eld
theory calculation and the supergravity calculation if we incorporate the exclusion
principle by assigning a degree to each supergravity eld, as explained in [463],
and then considering only multiparticle states with degree smaller than k. one can
further wonder whether there is something special that happens at j = k/2, when the
exclusion principle starts making a dierence. since we are considering states with
high conformal weight and angular momentum it is natural to wonder whether there
are any black hole states that could appear. there are black holes which carry angular
momentum on s3. these black holes are characterized by the two angular momenta
jl, jr, of su(2)lsu(2)r. the minimum black hole mass for given angular momenta
was given in (5.17), mmin(jl, jr) = k/2 + j 2
r/k, where we used c = 6k and
(5.4). we see that these masses are always bigger than the mass of the chiral primary
states with angular momenta (jl, jr), except when jl = jr = k/2. so we see that
something special is happening at j = k/2, since at this point a black hole appears
as a chiral primary state. connections between this exclusion principle and quantum
groups and non-commutative geometry were studied in [477, 478].

l/k + j 2

5.3.4 calculation of the elliptic genus in supergravity

we could now consider states which are left moving chiral primaries and anything on
the right moving side. these states are also in small representations, and one might
be tempted to compute the spectrum of chiral primaries at the orbifold point and then
try to match it to supergravity. however, this is not the correct thing to do, and in
fact the spectrum does not match [479]. it is not correct because some chiral primary
states could pair up and become very massive non-chiral primaries.
in the case of
chiral-anything states, a useful tool to count the number of states, which gives a result
that is independent of the deformations of the theory, is the elliptic genus, which is
the partition function

zk = t rrr[(1)2j+2jql0 q l0yj].

(5.25)

168

this receives contributions only from the left moving ground states, l0 = 0. these
states map into (chiral, anything) under spectral ow, i.e. states that are chiral pri-
maries on the left moving side but are unrestricted on the right moving side.

the number of states contributing to the elliptic genus goes like e2nk for large
powers qn. this raised some doubts that (5.25) would agree with supergravity. the
elliptic genus diverges when we take the limit k  . the origin of this divergence is
the contribution of the (2, 0) form, which is a chiral primary on the left but it carries
zero conformal weight on the right. so, we get a contribution of order k from the fact
that this state could be occupied k times without changing the powers of q or y. the
function that has a smooth limit in the k   limit is then z n s
k /k. in the k3 case
this function is

z n s

qm1(1  qm/2ym/2)24(1  qm/2ym/2)24

we can now compare this expression to the supergravity result. in the supergravity
result we explicitly exclude the contribution of the (2, 0) form, since it is directly related
to the factor of k that we extracted, but we keep the contribution of the (0, 2) form and
the rest of the elds. the supergravity result then agrees precisely with (5.26) [463].
both in the supergravity calculation and in the conformal eld theory calculation at
the orbifold point there are many elds of the form (chiral,anything), but most of
them cancel out to give (5.26). for example, we can see that the only supergravity
single particle states that contribute for large powers of y>1/2 are the (chiral, chiral)
and (chiral, antichiral) states. one can further incorporate the exclusion principle in
supergravity by assigning degrees to the various elds, and then one nds that the
elliptic genus agrees up to powers of qh with h  (k + 1)/4 [463]. here again this is
the point where a black hole starts contributing to the elliptic genus. it is an extremal
rotating black hole with angular momentum jl = k/2 and jr = 0, which has l0 = k/4
and l0 = k/2.

5.4 other ads3 compactications

we start by discussing the compactications discussed in the last section more broadly,
and then we will discuss other ads3 compactications.
in the previous section we
started out with type iib string theory compactied on m 4 to six dimensions. the
theory has many charges carried by string like objects, which come from branes wrap-
ping on various cycles of m 4. these charges transform as vectors under the duality
group of the theory so(5, n), where n = 21, 5 for the k3 and t 4 cases respectively.
these 5 + n strings correspond to the fundamental and d strings, the ns and d ve-
branes wrapped on m 4, and to d3 branes wrapped on the n + 1 two-cycles of m 4. a

169

general charge conguration is given by a vector qi transforming under so(5, n). the
radius of curvature of the gravity solution is proportional to q2, r4  q2, where we use
the so(5, n) metric. in the k3 case q2 > 0 for supersymmetric congurations. the six
dimensional space-time theory has 5n massless scalar elds, which parameterize the
coset manifold so(5, n)/so(5)  so(n) [480]. when we choose a particular charge
vector, with q2 > 0, we break the duality group to so(4, n), and out of the original 5n
massless scalars n becomes massive and have values determined by the charges (and
the other scalars) [481]. the remaining 4n scalars are massless and represent moduli
of the supergravity compactication and, therefore, moduli of the dual conformal eld
theory. note that the conformal eld theory involves the instanton moduli space, but
here the word moduli refers to the parameters of the cft, such as the shape of t 4,
etc.

if we start moving in this moduli space we sometimes nd that the gravity solution
is best described by doing duality transformations [444, 332]. one interesting region
in moduli space is when the system is best described in terms of a system of ns
vebranes and fundamental strings. this is the s-dual version of the d1-d5 system
that we were considering above. in this ns background the radius of the s3 and of ads3
is r2 = q5, and it is independent of q1. actually, q1 only enters through the six
dimensional string coupling, which in this case is a xed scalar g2
6 = q5/q1. the volume
of m 4 is a free scalar in this case. the advantage of this background is that one can solve
string theory on it to all orders in , since it is a wzw model, actually an sl(2, r)
su(2) wzw model. string propagation in sl(2, r) wzw models were studied in
[482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488, 489, 490, 491, 492, 493, 494, 495, 496, 497, 498, 499,
500, 501]. thus, in this case we can also consider states corresponding to massive string
modes, etc. we can also dene the spacetime virasoro generators in the full string
theory, and check that they act on string states as they should [495, 496, 497]5. in
the string theory description the virasoro symmetry appears directly in the formalism
as a spacetime symmetry. one can also study d-branes in these ads3 backgrounds
[504]. conditions for spacetime supersymmetry for string theory on sl(2, r) wzw
backgrounds were studied in [505, 506]. in the d1-d5 conguration it is much harder
to solve string theory, since rr backgrounds are involved. classical actions for strings
on these backgrounds were written in [507, 508, 509]. however, a formulation of string
theory on these backgrounds was proposed in [510] (see also [511, 506, 512]). for
some values of the moduli the cft is singular. what this means is that we will have
a continuum of states in the cylinder picture.
in the picture with ns charges this
happens, for example, when all rr b-elds on m 4 are zero. this continuum of states
comes from fundamental strings stretching close to the boundary of ads3. these states

5congurations with ns uxes that lead to ads2d+1 spaces where studied in [502]. it has also

been suggested [503] that (2,1) strings can describe ads3 spaces.

170

have nite energy, even though they are long, due to the interaction with the constant
three form eld strength, h = dbn s, on ads3 [331, 332].

a simple variation of the previous theme is to quotient (orbifold) the three-sphere by
a zn  su(2)l. this preserves n = (4, 0) supersymmetry. this quotient changes the
central charge of the theory by a factor of n through (5.4) (since the volume of the s3
is smaller by a factor of n). it is also possible to obtain this geometry by considering
the near horizon behavior of a d1-d5 + kk monopole system, or equivalently a d1-d5
system near an an singularity. it is possible to analyze the eld theory by using the
methods in [333], and using the above anomaly argument one can calculate the right
moving central charge. the left moving central charge should be calculated by a more
detailed argument. when we have ns 5 branes and fundamental strings on an an
singularity, the worldsheet theory is solvable, and one can calculate the spectrum of
massive string states, etc.
[513]. one can also consider also both rr and ns uxes
simultaneously [514]. other papers analyzing aspects of these quotients or orbifolds
are [515, 515, 516, 517, 518].

a related conguration arises if we consider m-theory on m 6, where m 6 = t 6, t 2 
k3 or cy3, and we wrap m5 branes on a four-cycle in m 6 with non-vanishing triple
self-intersection number. then, we get a string in ve dimensions, and the near horizon
f , where the subscript on m 6
geometry of the supergravity solution is ads3  s2  m 6
f
indicates that the vector moduli of m 6 are xed scalars.
in this case we get again
an n = (0, 4) theory, and the su(2)r symmetry is associated to rotations of the
sphere. it is possible to calculate the central charge by counting the number of moduli
of the brane conguration. some of the moduli correspond to geometric deformations
and some of them correspond to b-elds on the vebrane worldvolume [519, 520]. a
supergravity analysis of this compactication was done in [434, 521].

another interesting case is string theory compactied on ads3 s3 s3 s1, which
has a large n = 4 symmetry [522, 523, 524]. this algebra is sometimes called a. it
includes an su(2)k  su(2)k  u(1) current algebra. the relative sizes of the levels
of the two su(2) factors are related to the relative sizes of the radii of the spheres.
this case seems to be conceptually simpler than the case with an m 4, since all the
spacetime dimensions are associated to a symmetry of the system6. in [522] a geometry
like this was obtained from branes, except that the s1 was replaced by r, and it is not
clear which brane conguration gives the geometry with the s1. this makes it more
dicult to guess the dual conformal eld theory. in [523] a cft dual was proposed
for this system in the case that k = k. one starts with a theory with a free boson and
four free fermions, which has large n = 4 symmetry. let us call this theory cf t3.
then, we can consider the theory based on the symmetric product sym(cf t3)k. the
6in the case of t 4 one can show that the u (1)4 symmetries of the torus can be viewed as the

k   limit of the large n = 4 algebra [525].

171

space-time theory has two moduli, which are the radius of the circle and the value of
the rr scalar. these translate into the radius of the compact u(1)-boson in cf t3
and a blow up mode of the orbifold. in [524] a dual cft was proposed for the general
case (k 6= k).

another interesting example is the d1-d5 brane system in type i string theory
[526, 527, 528]. the n = (0, 4) theory on the d1 brane worldvolume theory encodes
in the yukawa couplings the adhm data for the construction of the moduli space of
instantons [529, 530]. what distinguishes the type i system from the type iib case is
the so(32) gauge group in the open string sector. when the d5 branes wrap a compact
space m 4 with m 4 = t 4, k3, the near horizon geometry of the type i supergravity
solution is ads3s3m 4 [528]. as in the previous examples, one is lead to conjecture
a duality between type i string theory on ads3  s3  m 4 and the two-dimensional
(0, 4) scft in the ir limit of the d1 brane worldvolume theory. the supergroup of
the type i compactication is su(1, 1|2)  sl(2, r)  su(2), and the kaluza-klein
spectrum in the supergravity can be analyzed as in [434]. the correspondence to the
two-dimensional scft has not been much explored yet.

the relation between ads3 compactications and matrix theory [23] was addressed

in [531].

5.5 pure gravity

one might suspect that the simplest theory we could have on ads3 is pure einstein
gravity. in higher dimensions this is not possible since pure gravity is not renormal-
izable, so the only known sensible quantum gravity theory is string theory, but in
three dimensions gravity can be rewritten as a chern-simons theory [469, 470], and
this theory is renormalizable. gravity in three dimensions has no dynamical degrees
of freedom. we have seen, nevertheless, that it has black hole solutions when we
consider gravity with a negative cosmological constant [429] (5.8). so, it should at
least describe the dynamics of these black holes, black hole collisions, etc. it has been
argued that this chern-simons theory reduces to a liouville theory at the boundary
[471, 473, 474, 532], with the right central charge (5.4). naively, using the cardy for-
mula, this liouville theory does not seem to give the same entropy as the black holes,
but the cardy formula does not hold in this case (liouville theory does not satisfy the
assumptions that go into the cardy formula). hopefully, these problems will be solved
once it is understood how to properly quantize liouville theory. since we have the
right central charge it seems that we should be able to calculate the btz black hole
entropy [433], but liouville theory is very peculiar and the entropy seems smaller [533].
other papers studying ads pure gravity or btz black holes in pure gravity include
[534, 278, 535, 536, 537, 538, 539, 540, 541, 542, 543, 544, 545, 546, 547, 548, 549, 550,

172

551, 552, 553].

the chern-simons approach to gravity has also led to a proposal for a black hole
entropy counting in this pure gravity theory. in that approach the black hole entropy
is supposed to come from degrees of freedom in the chern-simons theory that become
dynamical when a horizon is present [554].

one interesting question in three dimensional gravity is whether we should consider
the chern-simons theory on a xed topology or whether we should sum over topologies.
naively it is the second possibility, however it could be that the sum over topologies is
already included in the chern-simons path integral over a xed topology.

in any case, three dimensional pure gravity is part of the full string theory compact-

ications, and it would be interesting to understand it better.

the situation is similar if one studies pure ads3 supergravities [136, 472, 555].

5.6 greybody factors

in this section we consider an extremal or near extremal black string in six dimensions.
we take the direction along the string to be compact, with radius r5  ls. we need to
take it to be compact since classically an innite black string is unstable [556, 557]. here
we assume that the temperature is small enough so that the conguration is classically
stable7. we take a conguration with d1 brane charge q1 and d5 brane charge q5.
the general solution with these charges, and arbitrary energy and momentum along
the string, has the following six dimensional einstein metric8 [458, 558] :

we consider the case that the internal space m 4 = t 4. in general we will also have
some scalars that are non-constant. these become xed scalars in the near-horizon
ads3 limit. in this case there are ve xed scalars, which are three self-dual ns b-
elds, a combination of the rr scalar and the four-form on t 4, and nally the volume
of t 4. if we take the rst four to zero at innity they stay zero throughout the solution.

7a general supergravity analysis of the various regimes in the d1-d5 system was given in [280].
8throughout this section we use the six dimensional einstein metric, related to the six dimensional

string metric by ge = e6gstr, where 6 is the six dimensional dilaton.

the near extremal black string corresponds to the case that r5 is large and the total
mass is just above the rest energy of the branes. by rest energy of the branes we
mean the mass given by the bps bound,

e = m  q5r5v 

q1r5v

.

(5.33)

note that this includes the mass due to the excitations carrying momentum along the
circle. in the limit that   0 with e, r5 and n xed we automatically go into the

174

regime described by the conformal eld theory living on the d1-d5 system which is
decoupled. instead, we are going to take here  small but nonzero, so that we keep
some coupling of the cft to the rest of the degrees of freedom. the geometry is ads3
(locally) close to the horizon, but far away it is just the at six dimensional space
r1,4  s1. in this limit we can approximate the six dimensional geometry by

let us consider a minimally coupled scalar eld, , i.e. a scalar eld that is not a
xed scalar. let us send a quantum of that eld to the black string, and calculate the
absorption cross section for low energies. the low energy condition is

w  1/r5, 1/r1.

(5.36)

we will consider here just an s-wave conguration. we also set the momentum in the
direction of the string of the incoming particle to zero, the general case can be found
in [17, 559]. separation of variables,  = eit(r), leads to the radial equation

eld theory [560] :

where we summed over nal states in the cft and we averaged over initial states.
we will calculate the numerical coecients later. the average over initial states is
essentially an average over a thermal ensemble, since the number of states is very large
so the microcanonical ensemble is the same as a thermal ensemble. so, the nal result
is that we have to compute the two point function of the corresponding operator over a
thermal ensemble. this essentially translates into computing the correlation function
on the euclidean cylinder, and the result is proportional to (5.40) [15, 561, 560]. this
argument reproduces the functional dependence on  of (5.40). for other elds (non-
minimally coupled) the functional dependence on  is determined just in terms of the
conformal weight of the associated operator.

let us emphasize that the matching procedure (5.38) is valid only in the low energy
regime (5.36). in this regime the typical gravitational size of the conguration, which
is of order r5, is much smaller than the compton wavelength of the particle. see gure
1.4. in fact, note that in the connecting region r  r5 the function  does not vary very
much. let us see this more explicitly. we see from (5.37) that we can approximate the
equation by something like 2r2
5 +  = 0. from (5.36) we see that the variation of 
is very small over this connecting region. furthermore, since absorption will turn out
to be small, we can approximate the value of  at the origin by the value it has in at
space. so, we can directly match the values of  at the origin for a wave propagating
in at space with the value of  near the boundary of ads3.

176

in order to match the numerical coecient we need to determine the numerical
coecient in the two-point function of the operator o. this can be done for minimally
coupled scalars using a non-renormalization theorem, as it was done for the case of
absorption of gravitons on a d3 brane. the argument is the following. we rst notice
that the moduli space of minimally coupled scalars in supergravity is so(4, 5)/so(4)
so(5). this is a homogeneous space with some metric, so the gravity lagrangian in
spacetime will include

s =

1
22

6 z d6xgab()ab.

(5.43)

(5.44)

the elds a couple to operators oa, and we are interested in computing

hoa(x)ob(0)i =

gab
x4 .

the operators oa are a basis of marginal deformations of the cft, and gab is the
metric on the moduli space of the cft. since the conformal eld theory has n = (4, 4)
supersymmetry, this metric is highly constrained. in fact, it was shown in [562] that it
is the homogeneous metric on so(4, 5)/so(4)  so(5) (up to global identications).
since the cft moduli space is the same as the supergravity moduli space, the two
metrics could dier only by an overall numerical factor gab = dgab, where d is a
number. in order to compute this number we can go to a point in moduli space where
the cft is just the orbifold sym(t 4)k. this point corresponds to having a single d5
brane and k = q5q1 d1 branes. we can also choose the string coupling to be arbitrarily
small. for example, we can choose the scalar  to be an o-diagonal component of the
metric on t 4. the absorption cross section calculation then reduces to the one done in
[15], which we now review. we take the metric on the four-torus to be gij = ij + hij,
where h is a small perturbation, and choose  = h12. the bulk action for  then
reduces to

()2.

the coupling of h to the elds on the d1 branes can be derived by expanding the

to extract the cross-section we take r5 = , but the volume of the transverse space

(5.47)
since we have put the four transverse dimensions into a box of volume v , the ux
of the hij gravitons on the brane is f = 1/v . to nd the cross-section we divide the
net decay rate by the ux. the unusual factors of 26 and 1/2gs come from
the coecients of the kinetic terms for h12 and x i (5.45)(5.46). the leading factor
of 2 in the equation for (k0) in (5.47) is there because there are two distinguishable
nal states that can come out of a given h12 initial state: an x 1 boson moving left
and an x 2 boson moving right, or x 1 moving right and x 2 moving left. the factor of
q1q5 comes from the fact that we have q1q5 d1 branes. note that the delta function
constraints plus the on shell conditions imply that p0 = q0 = p5 = q5 = /2 and
p  q = 2/2.

the nal answer in (5.47) agrees with the zero temperature limit of (5.40). as we
remarked before, the thermal-looking factors in (5.40) can be derived just by doing a
calculation of the two point function on the cylinder [560]. finally, we should remark
that this calculation implies that the metric on the moduli space of the cft has
an overall factor of k = q1q5 as compared with the metric that appears in the six
dimensional gravity action (5.43). this blends in perfectly with the expectations from
ads3/cft, since in the ads3 region, by the time we go down to three dimensions, we
get factors of the volume of the s3 and the radius of ads3 which produce the correct
factor of k in the gravity answer for the metric on the moduli space.

of course, this absorption cross section calculation is also related to the time reversed
process of hawking emission. indeed, the hawking radiation rates calculated in gravity
and in the conformal eld theory coincide.

many other greybody factors were calculated and compared with the eld theory
predictions [16, 559, 563, 564, 565, 560, 566, 64, 567, 568, 569, 570, 571, 572, 71, 573,
574, 575, 576]. in some of these references the eective string model is mentioned.
this eective string model is essentially the conformal eld theory at the orbifold

178

point sym(t 4)k. some of the gravity calculations did not agree with the eective
string calculation. typically that was because either the energies considered were not
low enough, or because one needed to take into account the eect of the deformation
in the cft away from the symmetric product point in the moduli space.

5.7 black holes in five dimensions

if we kaluza-klein reduce, using [577, 578], the metric (5.27) on the circle along the
string, we get a ve dimensional charged black hole solution :

(5.49)

this is just the ve-dimensional schwarzschild metric, with the time and space com-
ponents rescaled by dierent powers of . the solution is manifestly invariant under
permutations of the three boost parameters, as required by u-duality. the event hori-
zon is clearly at r = r0. the coordinates we have used present the solution in a simple
and symmetric form, but they do not always cover the entire spacetime. when all three
charges are nonzero, the surface r = 0 is a smooth inner horizon. this is analogous to
the situation in four dimensions with four charges [579, 580].

the mass, entropy and temperature of this solution are the same as those calculated
above for the black string (5.30)(5.31)(5.32). it is interesting to take the extremal limit
r0  0 with r0e, r0e, r0e nite and nonzero. this is an extremal black hole solution
in ve dimensions with a non-singular horizon which has non-zero horizon area. the
entropy becomes

s = 2qq1q5n,

(5.50)

which is independent of all the continuous parameters in the theory, and depends only
on the charges (5.29). we can calculate this entropy as follows [12]. these black
hole states saturate the bps bound, so they are bps states. thus, we should nd
an index, which is a quantity that is invariant under deformations and counts the
number of bps states. such an index was computed in [12] for the case where the
internal space was m 4 = k3 and in [447] for m 4 = t 4. these indices are also called
helicity supertrace formulas [581]. once we know that they do not receive contributions
from non-bps quantities, we can change the parameters of the theory and go to a point
where we can do the calculation, for example, we can take r5 to be large and then go
to the point where we have the sym(m 4)k description.

179

it is interesting that we can also consider near extremal black holes, in the approx-
imation that the contribution to the mass of two of the charges is much bigger than
the third and much bigger than the mass above extremality. this region in parameter
space is sometimes called the dilute gas regime. in the ve dimensional context it
is natural to take r5  ls, and at rst sight we would not expect the cft description
to be valid. nevertheless, it is experimentally observed that the absorption cross
section is still (5.40), since the calculation is exactly the same as the one we did above.
this suggests that the cft description is also valid in this case. a qualitative expla-
nation of this fact was given in [455], where it was observed that the the strings could
be multiply wound leading to a very low energy gap, much lower than 1/r5, and of
the right order of magnitude as expected for a 5d black hole.

almost all that we said in this subsection can be extended to four dimensional black

holes.

other ads spaces and
non-conformal theories

6.1 other branes

6.1.1 m5 branes

there exist six dimensional n = (2, 0) scfts, which have sixteen supercharges, and
are expected to be non-trivial isolated xed points of the renormalization group in
six dimensions (see [91] and references therein). as a consequence, they have neither
dimensionful nor dimensionless parameters. these theories have an sp(2)  so(5)
r-symmetry group.

the an1 (2, 0) theory is realized as the low-energy theory on the worldvolume of
n coincident m5 branes (ve branes of m theory). the n = (2, 0) supersymmetry
algebra includes four real spinors of the same chirality, in the 4 of so(5). its only
irreducible massless matter representation consists of a 2-form b with a self-dual
eld strength, ve real scalars and fermions.
it is called a tensor multiplet. for a
single 5-brane the ve real scalars in the tensor multiplet dene the embedding of the
m5 brane in eleven dimensions. the r-symmetry group is the rotation group in the
ve dimensions transverse to the m5 worldvolume, and it rotates the ve scalars. the
low-energy theory on the moduli space of at directions includes r tensor multiplets
(where for the an1 theories r = n  1). the moduli space is parametrized by the
scalars in the tensor multiplets. it has orbifold singularities (for the an1 theory it
is r5(n1)/sn ) and the theory at the singularities is superconformal. the self-dual
2-form b couples to self-dual strings. at generic points on the moduli space these
strings are bps saturated, and at the superconformal point their tension goes to zero.
the an1 (2, 0) superconformal theory has a matrix-like dlcq description as quan-
tum mechanics on the moduli space of an1 instantons [582]. in this description the

181

chiral primary operators are identied with the cohomology with compact support of
the resolved moduli space of instantons, which is localized at the origin [583]. their
lowest components are scalars in the symmetric traceless representations of the so(5)
r-symmetry group.

(6.1)

and there is a 4-form ux of n units on the s4.

the near horizon geometry of (6.1) is of the form ads7  s4 with the radii of
curvature rads = 2rs 4 = 2lp(n)1/3. note that since rads 6= rs 4 this background
is not conformally at, unlike the ads5  s5 background discussed above. following
similar arguments to those of section 3.1 leads to the conjecture that the an1 (2, 0)
scft is dual to m theory on ads7  s4 with n units of 4-form ux on s4 [5].

the eleven dimensional supergravity description is applicable for large n, since then
the curvature is small in planck units. corrections to supergravity will go like positive
powers of lp/rads  n1/3; the supergravity action itself is of order m 9
p  n 3 (instead
of n 2 in the ads5  s5 case). the known corrections in m theory are all positive
powers of l3
p  1/n, suggesting that the (2, 0) theories have a 1/n expansion at large
n. the bosonic symmetry of the supergravity compactication is so(6, 2)  so(5).
the so(6, 2) part is the conformal group of the scft, and the so(5) part is its
r-symmetry.

the kaluza-klein excitations of supergravity contain particles with spin less than
two, so they fall into small representations of supersymmetry. therefore, their masses
are protected from quantum (m theory) corrections. as in the other examples of the
duality, these excitations correspond to chiral primary operators of the an1 (2, 0)
scft, whose scaling dimensions are protected from quantum corrections. the spec-
trum of kaluza-klein harmonics of supergravity on ads7  s4 was computed in [584].
the lowest components of the susy multiplets are scalar elds with

m2r2

ads = 4k(k  3),

k = 2, 3,   .

(6.2)

they fall into the k-th order symmetric traceless representation of so(5) with unit
multiplicity. the k = 1 excitation is the singleton that can be gauged away except on
the boundary of ads. it decouples from the other operators and can be identied with
the free center of mass tensor multiplet on the eld theory side.

1our conventions are such that the tension of the m2 brane is t2 = 1/(2)2l3
p.

182

using the relation between the dimensions of the operators  and the masses m of
the kaluza-klein excitations m2r2
ads = (6), the dimensions of the corresponding
operators in the scft are  = 2k, k = 2, 3,   [585, 586, 587, 588]. these are the
dimensions of the chiral primary operators of the an1 (2, 0) theory as found from the
dlcq description2. the expectation values of these operators parametrize the space
of at directions of the theory, (r5)n1/sn . the dimensions of these operators are the
same as the naive dimension of the product of k free tensor multiplets, though there is
no good reason for this to be true (unlike the d = 4 n = 4 theory, where the dimension
had to be similar to the free eld dimension for small , and then for the chiral operators
it could not change as we vary ). for large n, the k = 2 scalar eld with  = 4 is
the only relevant deformation of the scft and it breaks the supersymmetry. all the
non-chiral elds appear to have large masses in the large n limit, implying that the
corresponding operators have large dimensions in the eld theory.

the spectrum includes also a family of spin one kaluza-klein excitations that couple
to 1-form operators of the scft. the massless vectors in this family couple to the
dimension ve r-symmetry currents of the scft. the massless graviton couples to
the stress-energy tensor of the scft. as in the d = 4 n = 4 case, the chiral elds
corresponding to the dierent towers of kaluza-klein harmonics are related to the
scalar operators associated with the kaluza-klein tower (6.2) by the supersymmetry
algebra. for each value of (large enough) k, the susy multiplets include one eld
in each tower of kaluza-klein states. its so(5) representation is determined by the
representation of the scalar eld. for instance, the r-symmetry currents and the
energy-momentum tensor are in the same supersymmetry multiplet as the scalar eld
corresponding to k = 2 in equation (6.2).

as we did for the d3 branes in section 4.1, we can place the m5 branes at singularities
and obtain other dual models. if we place the m5 branes at the origin of r6  r5/
where  is a discrete subgroup of the so(5) r-symmetry group, we get ads7  s4/
as the near horizon geometry. with   su(2)  so(5) which is an ade group we
obtain theories with (1, 0) supersymmetry. the analysis of these models parallels that
of section 4.1.1. in particular, the matching of the -invariant supergravity kaluza-
klein modes and the eld theory operators has been discussed in [589].

another example is the dn (2, 0) scft. it is realized as the low-energy theory on
the worldvolume of n m5 branes at an r5/z2 orientifold singularity. the z2 reects
the ve coordinates transverse to the m5 branes and changes the sign of the 3-form
eld c of eleven dimensional supergravity. the near horizon geometry is the smooth
space ads7  rp4 [585]. in the supergravity solution we identify the elds at points
on the sphere with the elds at antipodal points, with a change of the sign of the c

cluded also the k = 1 operator.

eld. this identication projects out half of the kaluza-klein spectrum and only the
even k harmonics remain. an additional chiral eld arises from a m2 brane wrapped
on the 2-cycle in rp4, which is non-trivial due to the orientifolding; this is analogous
to the pfaan of the so(2n) d = 4 n = 4 sym theories which is identied with a
wrapped 3-brane [211] (as discussed in section 4.1.2). the dimension of this operator
is  = 2n. to leading order in 1/n the correlation functions of the other chiral
operators are similar to those of the an1 scft. the dn theories also have a dlcq
matrix description as quantum mechanics on the moduli space of dn instantons [582].
this moduli space is singular. one would expect to associate the spectrum of chiral
primary operators with the cohomology with compact support of some resolution of
this space, but such a resolution has not been constructed yet.

a dierent example is the (1, 0) six dimensional scft with e8 global symmetry,
which is realized on the worldvolume of m5 branes placed on top of the nine brane in
the horava-witten [590] compactication of m theory on r10s1/z2. the conjectured
dual description is in terms of m theory on ads7  s4/z2 [591]. the z2 action has a
xed locus ads7s3 on which a ten dimensional n = 1 e8 vector multiplet propagates.
the chiral operators fall into short representations of the supergroup osp(6, 2|2). in
[592] e8 neutral and charged operators of the (1, 0) theory were matched with kaluza-
klein modes of bulk elds and elds living on the singular locus, respectively.

correlation functions of chiral primary operators of the large n (2, 0) theory can
be computed by solving classical dierential equations for the supergravity elds that
correspond to the eld theory operators. two and three point functions of the chiral
primary operators have been computed in [593].

the (2, 0) scft has wilson surface observables [594], which are generalizations

of the operator given by w () = exp(ir bd) in the theory of a free tensor

multiplet, where  is a two dimensional surface. a prescription for computing the
wilson surface in the dual m theory picture has been given in [286].
it amounts,
in the supergravity approximation, to the computation of the minimal volume of a
membrane bounded at the boundary of ads7 by . the reasoning is analogous to that
discussed in section 3.5, but here instead of the strings stretched between d-branes,
m2 branes are stretched between m5 branes. such an m2 brane behaves as a string on
the m5 branes worldvolume, with a tension proportional to the distance between the
m5 branes. by separating one m5 brane from n m5 branes this string can be used
as a probe of the scft on the worldvolume of the n m5 branes, analogous to the
external quarks discussed in section 3.5. if we consider two such parallel strings with
length l and distance l and of opposite orientation, the resulting potential per unit
length is [286]

v
l

= c

n
l2 ,

184

(6.3)

where c is a positive numerical constant. the dependence on l is as expected from
conformal invariance. the procedure for wilson surface computations has been applied
also to the computation of the operator product expansion of wilson surfaces, and the
extraction of the ope coecients of the chiral primary operators [593].

the six dimensional an1 theory can be wrapped on various two dimensional mani-
folds. at energies lower than the inverse size of the manifolds, the low-energy eective
description is in terms of four dimensional su(n) gauge theories. the two dimensional
manifold and its embedding in eleven dimensions determine the amount of supersym-
metry of the gauge theory. the simplest case is a wrapping on t 2 which preserves all the
supersymmetry. this results in the n = 4 su(n) scft, with the complex gauge cou-
pling being the complex structure  of the torus. in general, when the two dimensional
manifold is a holomorphic curve (riemann surface), called a supersymmetric cycle, the
four dimensional theory is supersymmetric. for n = 2 supersymmetric gauge theo-
ries the riemann surface is the seiberg-witten curve and its period matrix gives the
low energy holomorphic gauge couplings ij (i, j = 1,   , n  1) [595, 596, 597, 342].
for n = 1 supersymmetric gauge theories the riemann surface has genus zero and it
encodes holomorphic properties of the supersymmetric gauge theory, namely the struc-
ture of its moduli space of vacua [598]. for a generic real two dimensional manifold
the four dimensional theory is not supersymmetric. some qualitative properties of the
qcd string [599] and the  vacua follow from the wrapping procedure. of course,
in the non-supersymmetric cases the subtle issue of stability has to be addressed as
discussed in section 4.1. in general it is not known how to compute the near-horizon
limit of 5-branes wrapped on a general manifold. at any rate, it seems that the theory
on m5 branes is very relevant to the study of four dimensional gauge theories. the
m5 branes theory will be one starting point for an approach to studying pure qcd in
section 6.2.

other works on m5 branes in the context of the ads/cft correspondence are [600,

601, 602, 603, 604, 605, 606, 607, 608, 609, 610, 611].

6.1.2 m2 branes

n = 8 supersymmetric gauge theories in three dimensions can be obtained by a di-
mensional reduction of the four dimensional n = 4 gauge theory. the automorphism
group of the n = 8 supersymmetry algebra is so(8). the fermionic generators of the
n = 8 supersymmetry algebra transform in the real two dimensional representation of
the so(2, 1) lorentz group, and in the 8s representation of the so(8) automorphism
algebra. the massless matter representation of the algebra consists of eight bosons in
the 8v and eight fermions in the 8c of so(8). viewed as a dimensional reduction of
the vector multiplet of the four dimensional n = 4 theory which has six real scalars,

185

one extra scalar is the component of the gauge eld in the reduced dimension and the
second extra scalar is the dual to the vector in three dimensions.

an n = 8 supersymmetric yang-mills lagrangian does not posses the full so(8)
symmetry. it is only invariant under an so(7) subgroup. at long distances it is ex-
pected to ow to a superconformal theory that exhibits the so(8) r-symmetry (see
[91] and references therein). the ow will be discussed in the next section. this ir
conformal theory is realized as the low-energy theory on the worldvolume of n overlap-
ping m2 branes. for a single m2 brane, the eight real scalars dene its embedding in
eleven dimensions. the r-symmetry group is the rotation group in the eight transverse
dimensions to the m2 worldvolume, which rotates the eight scalars.

the eleven dimensional supergravity metric describing n m2 branes is given by

ds2 = f2/3(dt2 + dx2
f = 1 +

322nl6
p

,

r6

1 + dx2

2) + f 1/3(dr2 + r2d2

7) ,

(6.4)

and there are n units of ux of the dual to the 4-form eld on s7.

the near horizon geometry of (6.4) is of the form ads4  s7 with the radii of
curvature 2rads = rs 4 = lp(322n)1/6. one conjectures that the three dimensional
n = 8 scft on the worldvolume of n m2 branes is dual to m theory on ads4  s7
with n units of ux of the dual to the 4-form eld on s7 [5].

the supergravity description is applicable for large n. corrections to supergravity
will be proportional to positive powers of lp/rads  n1/6; the known corrections are
p  n1/2. the supergravity action itself is in this case
all proportional to powers of l3
proportional to m 9
p  n 3/2, so this will be the leading behavior of all correlation func-
tions in the large n limit. the bosonic symmetry of the supergravity compactication
is so(3, 2)  so(8). as is standard by now, the so(3, 2) part is identied with the
conformal group of the three dimensional scft, and the so(8) part is its r-symmetry.
the fermionic symmetries may also be identied. we can relate the chiral elds of the
scft with the kaluza-klein excitations of supergravity whose spectrum was analyzed
in [612, 613].

the lowest component of the supersymmetry multiplets is a family of scalar excita-

tions with

m2r2

ads =

1
4

k(k  6),

k = 2, 3,   .

(6.5)

they fall into the k-th order symmetric traceless representation of so(8) with unit
multiplicity. the dimensions of the corresponding operators in the n = 8 scft are
 = k/2, k = 2, 3,   [585, 586, 588]. their expectation values parametrize the space
of at directions of the theory, (r8)n1/sn . when viewed as the ir limit of the three
dimensional n = 8 yang-mills theory, some of these operators can be identied as

186

tr(i1...ik) where i are the seven scalars of the vector multiplet. as noted above,
the eighth scalar arises upon dualizing the vector eld, which we can perform explicitly
only in the abelian case. the other chiral elds are all obtained by the action of the
supersymmetry generators on the elds of (6.5).

unlike the (2, 0) scfts, the d = 3 n = 8 theories do not have a simple dlcq
description (see [614]), and the spectrum of their chiral operators is not known. the
above spectrum is the prediction of the conjectured duality, for large n.

we can place the m2 branes at singularities and obtain other dual models, as in sec-
tion 4.1. if we place the m2 branes at the origin of r3r8/ with  a discrete subgroup
of the so(8) r-symmetry group, we get ads4s7/ as the near horizon geometry. one
class of models is when   su(2)su(2) is a cyclic group. it is generated by multiply-
ing the complex coordinates z1,2,3,4 of c4  r8 by diag(e2i/k, e2i/k, e2ia/k, e2ia/k)
for relatively prime integers a, k. when a = 1, k = 2 the near horizon geometry is
ads4  rp7 with a dual n = 8 theory, which is the ir limit of the so(2n) gauge
theory [585]. as in section 4.1.2, one can add a discrete theta angle to get additional
theories [615, 616]. when a = 1, k > 2 one gets n = 6 supersymmetry, while for
a 6= 1 the supersymmetry is reduced to n = 4. other models are obtained by non
cyclic . as for the d3 branes [336] and the m5 branes [589], the -invariant super-
gravity kaluza-klein modes and the eld theory operators of some of these models
have been analyzed in [617].

another class of models is obtained by putting the m2 branes at hypersurface sin-

gularities dened by the complex equation

x2 + y2 + z2 + v3 + w6k1 = 0 ,

(6.6)

where k is an integer. the near horizon geometry is of the form ads4  h, where h
is topologically equivalent to s7 but in general not dieomorphic to it. some of these
examples, k = 1,   , 28, correspond to the known exotic seven-spheres. the expected
supersymmetry is at least n = 2 and may be n = 3, depending on whether the r-
symmetry group corresponding to the isometry group of the metric on the exotic seven
spheres is so(2) or so(3). an example with n = 1 supersymmetry is when h is the
squashed seven sphere which is the homogeneous space (sp(2)sp(1))/(sp(1)sp(1)).
in this case the r-symmetry group is trivial (so(1)).

a general classication of possible near horizon geometries of the form ads4  h
and related scfts in three dimensions is given in [322, 321]. most of these scfts
have not been explored yet.

other works on m2 branes in the context of the ads/cft correspondence are [618,

619, 620, 621, 389, 622, 623, 624, 625, 626, 328, 627].

187

6.1.3 dp branes

next, we discuss the near-horizon limits of other dp-branes. they give spaces which
are dierent from ads, corresponding to the fact that the low-energy eld theories on
the dp-branes are not conformal.

s

the dp branes of the type ii string are charged under the ramond-ramond p + 1-
form potential. their tension is given by tp  1/gslp+1
and is equal to their ramond-
ramond charge. they are bps saturated objects preserving half of the 32 supercharges
of type ii string theories. the low energy worldvolume theory of n at coinciding dp
branes is thus invariant under sixteen supercharges. it is the maximally supersymmetric
p + 1 dimensional yang-mills theory with u(n) gauge group. its symmetry group is
iso(1, p)  so(9  p), where the rst factor is the p + 1 dimensional poincare group
and the second factor is the r-symmetry group. the theory can be obtained as a
dimensional reduction of n = 1 sym in ten dimensions to p + 1 dimensions.
its
bosonic elds are the gauge elds and 9 p scalars in the adjoint representation of the
gauge group. the scalars parametrize the embedding of the dp branes in the 9  p
transverse dimensions. the so(9p) r-symmetry group is the rotation group in these
dimensions, and the scalars transform in its vector representation. in the following we
will discuss the decoupling limit of the brane worldvolume theory from the bulk and
the regions of validity of dierent descriptions.

the yang-mills gauge coupling in the dp-brane theory is given by

g2
y m = 2(2)p2gslp3

s

.

(6.7)

the decoupling from the bulk (eld theory) limit is the limit ls  0 where we keep the
yang-mills coupling constant and the energies xed. for p  3 this implies that the
theory decouples from the bulk and that the higher gs and  corrections to the dp
brane action are suppressed. for p > 3, as seen from (6.7), the string coupling goes to
innity and we need to use a dual description to analyze this issue.

let u  r/ be a xed expectation value of a scalar. at an energy scale u, the

dimensionless eective coupling constant of the yang-mills theory is

(6.14)

in the form of the metric (6.12) it is easy to see that the uv/ir correspondence, as
described in section 3.1.3, leads to the relationship   z between wavelengths in the
dual eld theories and distances in the gravity solution. through (6.11) we can then
relate energies in the eld theory to distances in the u variable.

in the limit of innite u the eective string coupling (6.13) vanishes for p < 3. this
corresponds to the uv freedom of the yang-mills theory. for p > 3 the coupling
increases and we have to use a dual description. this corresponds to the fact that
the yang-mills theory is non renormalizable and new degrees of freedom are required
at short distances to dene the theory. the isometry group of the metric (6.12) is
iso(1, p)  so(9  p). the rst factor corresponds to the poincare symmetry group
of the yang-mills theory and the second factor corresponds to its r-symmetry group.
for each dp brane we can plot a phase diagram as a function of the two dimensionless
parameters gef f and n [628]. dierent regions in the phase diagram have a good
description in terms of dierent variables. as an example consider the d2 branes
in type iia string theory. the dimensionless eective gauge coupling (6.8) is now
g2
ef f  g2
y m n/u. the perturbative yang-mills description is valid for gef f  1. when
gef f  1 we have a transition from the perturbative yang-mills description to the
type iia supergravity description. the type iia supergravity description is valid

189

when both the curvature is string units (6.14) and the eective string coupling (6.13)
are small. this implies that n must be large.

when gef f > n 2/5 the eective string coupling becomes large.

in this region we
grow the eleventh dimension x11 and the good description is in terms of an eleven
dimensional theory. we can uplift the d2 brane solution (6.12) and (6.13) to an
eleven dimensional background that reduces to the ten dimensional background upon
kaluza-klein reduction on x11. this can be done using the relation between the ten
dimensional type iia string metric ds2

10 and the eleven dimensional metric ds2

ds2

 and a are the type iia dilaton and rr gauge eld. the 4-form eld strength is

when the curvature (6.16) is small we can use the eleven dimensional supergravity
description.

the metric (6.15) corresponds to the m2 branes solution smeared over the transverse
direction x11. the near-horizon limit of the supergravity solution describing m2 branes
localized in the compact dimension x11 has the form (6.4), but with a harmonic function
f of the form

f =

where r is the radial distance in the seven non-compact transverse directions and
x11  x11 + 2r11. x0
11 corresponds to the expectation value of the scalar dual to the
vector in the three dimensional gauge theory. the expression for the harmonic function
(6.17) can be poisson resummed at distances much larger than r11 = g2

the dierence between the localized m2 branes solution and the smeared one is the
exponential corrections in (6.18). they can be neglected at distances u  g2
y m , or
in terms of the dimensionless parameters when gef f  n 1/2. according to (6.11) this
corresponds to distance scales in the eld theory of order n /g2
y m . in this region we
can still use the up lifted d2 brane solution since it is the same as the one coming from
(6.17) up to exponentially small corrections. when gef f  n 1/2, which corresponds to
very low energies u  g2
y m , the sum in (6.17) is dominated by the n = 0 contribution.

this background is of the form (6.4) (with f = 322nl6
p/r6), namely the near-horizon
limit of m2 branes in eleven non-compact dimensions. this is the superconformal
theory which we discussed in the previous section. in gure 6.1 we plot the transition
between the dierent descriptions as a function of the energy scale u. we see the ow
from the high energy n = 8 super yang-mills theory realized on the worldvolume of
d2 branes to the low energy n = 8 scft realized on the worldvolume on m2 branes.

scale u. we see the ow from the high energy n = 8 super yang-mills theory to the
low energy n = 8 scft.

a similar analysis can be done for the other dp branes of the type ii string theories.
in the d0 branes case one starts at high energies with a perturbative super quantum
mechanics description. at intermediate energies the good description is in terms of the
type iia d0 brane solution. at low energies the theory is expected to describe matrix
black holes [630]. in the d1 branes case one starts in the uv with a perturbative super
yang-mills theory in two dimensions. in the intermediate region the good description is
in terms of the type iib d1 brane solution. the ir limit is described by the symn (r8)
orbifold scft. the d3 branes correspond to the n = 4 scft discussed extensively
above.

in the d4 branes case, the uv denition of the theory is obtained by starting with
the six dimensional (2, 0) scft discussed in section 6.1.1, and compactifying it on
a circle. at high energies, higher than the inverse size of the circle, we have a good
description in terms of the (2, 0) scft (or the ads7  s4 background of m theory).
the intermediate description is via the background of the type iia d4 brane. finally
at low energies we have a description in terms of perturbative super yang-mills theory
in ve dimensions. in the d5 branes case we have a good description in the ir region
in terms of super yang-mills theory. at intermediate energies the system is described
by the near-horizon background of the type iib d5 brane, and in the uv in terms of
the solution of the type iib ns 5-branes. we will discuss the ns 5-brane theories in
the next section.

consider now the system of n d6 branes of type iia string theory. as before, we can
attempt at a decoupling of the seven dimensional theory on the d6 branes worldvolume
from the bulk by taking the string scale to zero and keeping the energies and the seven

191

dimensional yang-mills coupling xed. the eective yang-mills coupling (6.8) is small
y m n)1/3 and super yang-mills is a good description in this
at low energies u  (g2
regime. the curvature in string units (6.14) is small when u  (g2
y m n)1/3 while the
eective string coupling (6.13) is small when u  n/g2/3
y m . in between these limits we
can use the type iia supergravity solution.

when u  n/g2/3

y m the eective string coupling is large and we should use the
description of d6-branes in terms of eleven dimensional supergravity compactied on
a circle with n kaluza-klein monopoles. equivalently, the description is in terms of
eleven dimensional supergravity on an ale space with an an1 singularity. when
u  n/g2/3
y m the curvature of the eleven dimensional space vanishes and, unlike the
lower dimensional branes, there does not not exist a seven dimensional eld theory
that describes the uv. in fact, the d6 brane worldvolume theory does not decouple
from the bulk.

p = gsl3

y m  gsl3

a simple way to see that the d6 brane worldvolume theory does not decouple from
the bulk is to note that now in the decoupling limit we keep g2
s xed. when
we lift the d6 branes solution to m theory, this means that the eleven dimensional
planck length l3
s remains xed, and therefore gravity does not decouple. an-
other way to see that gravity does not decouple is to consider the system of d6 branes at
nite temperature in the decoupling limit. for large energy densities above extremal-
ity, e/v  n/l7
p, we need the eleven dimensional description. this is given by an
uncharged schwarzschild black hole at the ale singularity. the associated hawking
temperature is th  1/qnl9
pe/v and there is hawking radiation to the asymptotic re-
gion of the bulk eleven dimensional supergravity. generally, the worldvolume theories
of dp-branes with p > 5 do not decouple from the bulk.

the supergravity computation of the wilson loop, discussed in section 3.5, can be
carried out for the dp brane theories. for instance for the n d2 branes theory one
gets for the quark antiquark potential, using the type iia sugra d2-brane solution
[286],

v = c

(6.19)

where c is a positive numerical constant. in view of the discussion above, this result
should be trusted only for loops with sizes 1/g2
y m . for smaller
loops the computation fails because we go into the perturbative regime, where the
potential becomes logarithmic. for larger loops we get into the ads4  s7 region.

other works on dp branes in the context of the ads/cft correspondence are [631,

629, 632, 633, 634, 635, 636, 637, 638].

6.1.4 ns5 branes

the ns5 branes of type ii string theories couple magnetically to the ns-ns b
eld, and they are magnetically dual to the fundamental string. their tension is given
sl6
by tn s  1/g2
s. like the dp branes, they are bps objects that preserve half of
the supersymmetry of type ii theories. a fundamental string propagating in the
background of n parallel ns5 branes is described far from the branes by a conformal
eld theory with non trivial metric, b eld and dilaton, constructed in [639]. the
string coupling grows as the string approaches the ns5-branes. at low energies the six
dimensional theory on the worldvolume of n type iib ns5 branes is a u(n) n = (1, 1)
super yang-mills theory, which is free in the ir. however, it is an interacting theory
at intermediate energies. at low energies the theory on the worldvolume of n type
iia ns5 branes is the an1 (2, 0) scft discussed above.

the six dimensional theories on the worldvolume of ns5 branes of type ii string

theories were argued [640] to decouple from the bulk in the limit

gs  0,

ls = f ixed .

(6.20)

this is because the eective coupling on the ns5 branes (e.g. the low-energy yang-mills
coupling in the type iib case) is 1/ls, while the coupling to the bulk modes goes like
gs. however, the computation of [641] showed that in this limit there is still hawking
radiation to the tube region of the ns 5-brane solution, suggesting a non decoupling
of the worldvolume theory from the bulk. in the spirit of the other correspondences
discussed previously, one can reconcile the two by conjecturing [210] that string or m
theory in the ns5 brane background in the limit (6.20), which includes the tube region,
is dual to the decoupled ns5 brane worldvolume theory (little string theory).
in
particular, the elds in the tube which are excited in the hawking radiation correspond
to objects in the decoupled ns5 brane theory. in the following we will mainly discuss
the type iia ns5 brane theory3.

the type iia ns5 brane may be considered as the m5 brane localized on the eleven
dimensional circle. therefore its metric is that of an m5 brane at a point on a transverse
circle. in such a conguration the near horizon metric of n ns5 branes can be written
as [628, 210]

at distances larger than lsn the ns5 brane theory is described by the an1 (2, 0)
scft. indeed, in the extreme low energy limit ls  0 the sum in (6.21) is dominated
by the n = 0 term and the background is of the form ads7  s4. this reduces to the
conjectured duality between m theory on ads7  s4 and the (2, 0) scft, discussed
previously. however, the ns5 brane theory is not a local quantum eld theory at all
energy scales since at short distances it is not described by a uv xed point. to see
this one can take ls to innity (or u to innity) in (6.21) and get a type iia background
s () = e2/lsn ,
with a linear dilaton. it has the topology of r1,5  r  s3 with g2
where  is the r coordinate. this is in accord with the fact that the ns5 brane
theory exhibits a t-duality property upon compactication on tori (note that in this
background a nite radius in eld theory units corresponds to a nite radius in string
theory units on the string theory side of the correspondence, unlike the previous cases
we discussed).

the ns5 brane theories have an a-d-e classication. this can be seen by viewing
them as type ii string theory on k3 with a-d-e singularities in the decoupling limit
(6.20). the ns5 brane theories have an so(4) r-symmetry which we identify with
the so(4) isometry of s3. the iia ns5-brane theories have a moduli space of vacua
of the form (r4  s1)r/w where r is the rank of the a-d-e gauge group and w
it is parametrized by the w-invariant products
is the corresponding weyl group.
of the 5r scalars in the r tensor multiplets. they fall into short representations of
the supersymmetry algebra. we can match these chiral operators with the string
excitations in the linear dilaton geometry describing the large u region of (6.21). the
string excitations, in short representations of the supersymmetry algebra, in the linear
dilaton geometry were analyzed in [210]. indeed, they match the spectrum of the chiral
operators in short representations of the ns5 brane theories. actually, due to the fact
that the string coupling goes to zero at the boundary of the linear dilaton solution, one
can compute here the precise spectrum of chiral elds in the string theory, and nd an
agreement with the eld theory even for nite n (stronger than the large n agreement
that we described in section 3.2).

as in the dualities with local quantum eld theories, also here one can compute
correlation functions by solving dierential equations on the ns5 branes background
(6.21). since in this case the boundary is innitely far away, it is more natural to
compute correlation functions in momentum space, which correspond to the s-matrix
in the background (6.21). the computation of two point functions of a scalar eld
was sketched in [210] and described more rigorously in [643]. the ns 5-brane theories
are non-local, and this causes some dierences in the matching between m theory and
the non-gravitational ns5-brane theory in this case. one dierence from the previous
cases we discussed is that in the linear dilaton backgrounds if we put a cuto at some
value of the radial coordinate (generalizing the discussion of [172] which we reviewed in

194

section 3.1.3), the volume enclosed by the cuto is not proportional to the area of the
boundary (which it is in ads space). thus, if holography is valid in these backgrounds
(in the sense of having a number of degrees of freedom proportional to the boundary
area) it is more remarkable than holography in ads space.

6.2 qcd

the proposed extension of the duality conjecture between eld theories and superstring
theories to eld theories at nite temperature, as described in section 3.6, opens up
the exciting possibility of studying the physically relevant non supersymmetric gauge
theories. of particular interest are non supersymmetric gauge theories that exhibit
asymptotic freedom and connement. in this section, we will discuss an approach to
studying pure (without matter elds) qcdp in p dimensions using a dual superstring
description. we will be discussing mainly the cases p = 3, 4.

the approach proposed by witten [182] was to start with a maximally supersym-
metric gauge theory on the p + 1 dimensional worldvolume of n dp branes. one then
compacties the supersymmetric theory on a circle of radius r0 and imposes anti-
periodic boundary conditions for the fermions around the circle. since the fermions do
not have zero frequency modes around the circle they acquire a mass mf  1/r0. the
scalars then acquire a mass from loop diagrams, and at energies much below 1/r0 they
decouple from the system. the expected eective theory at large distances compared
to the radius of the circle is pure qcd in p dimensions. note that a similar approach
was discussed in the treatment of gauge theories at nite temperature t in section
3.6, where the radius of the circle is proportional to 1/t . the high temperature limit
of the supersymmetric gauge theory in p + 1 dimensions is thus described by a non
supersymmetric gauge theory in p dimensions.

the main obstacle to the analysis is clear from the discussions of the duality between
string theory and quantum eld theories in the previous sections. the string approach
to weakly coupled gauge theories is not yet developed. most of the available tools
are applicable in the supergravity limit that describes the gauge theory with a large
number of colors and large t hooft parameter. in this regime we cannot really learn
directly about qcd, since the typical scale of candidate qcd states (glueballs) is
of the same order of magnitude (for qcd4, or a larger scale for qcd3) as the scale
1/r0 of the mass of the extra scalars and fermions. a related issue is that at
short distances asymptotically free gauge theories are weakly coupled and the dual
supergravity description is not valid. therefore, we will be limited to a discussion in
the strong coupling region of the gauge theories and in particular we will not be able
to exhibit asymptotic freedom.

195

one may hope that a full solution of the classical (gs = 0) string theory will provide
a description of large n gauge theories for all couplings (in the t hooft limit). to
study the gauge theories with a nite number of colors requires the quantum string
theory. however, there is also a possibility that the gauge description is valid for weak
coupling and the string theory description is valid for strong coupling with no smooth
crossover between the two descriptions. in such a scenario there is a phase transition
at  = c [306, 307]. this will prevent us from using the string description to study
qcd, and will prevent classical string theory from being the master eld for large n
qcd.

in the last part of this section we will briey discuss another approach, based on a
suggestion by polyakov [45], to study non supersymmetric gauge theories via a non su-
persymmetric string description. in this approach one can exhibit asymptotic freedom
qualitatively already in the gravity description. in the ir there are gravity solutions
that exhibit connement at large distances as well as strongly coupled xed points.

6.2.1 qcd3

the starting point for studying qcd3 is the n = 4 superconformal su(n) gauge the-
ory in four dimensions which is realized as the low energy eective theory of n coincid-
ing parallel d3 branes. as outlined above, the three-dimensional non-supersymmetric
theory is constructed by compactifying this theory on r3s1 with anti-periodic bound-
ary conditions for the fermions around the circle. the boundary conditions break su-
persymmetry explicitly and as the radius r0 of the circle becomes small, the fermions
decouple from the system since there are no zero frequency modes. the scalar elds
in the four dimensional theory will acquire masses at one-loop, since supersymmetry is
broken, and these masses become innite as r0  0. therefore in the infrared we are
left with only the gauge eld degrees of freedom and the theory should be eectively
the same as pure qcd3.

we will now carry out the same procedure in the dual superstring (supergravity)
picture. as has been extensively discussed in the previous sections, the n = 4 theory
on r4 is conjectured to be dual to type iib superstring theory on ads5  s5 with the
metric (3.5) or (3.6).

recall that the dimensionless gauge coupling constant g4 of the n = 4 theory is
related to the string coupling constant gs as g2
4  gs. in the t hooft limit, n  
with g2
4n  gsn xed, the string coupling constant vanishes, gs  0. therefore, we
could study the n = 4 theory using the tree level string theory in the ads space
(3.6). if also gsn  1, the curvature of the ads space is small and the string theory
is approximated by classical supergravity.

upon compactication on s1 with supersymmetry breaking boundary conditions,

196

(3.6) is replaced by the euclidean black hole geometry [178, 182] 4

.

(6.24)

the supergravity approximation is applicable for n   and gsn  1, so that all
the curvature invariants are small. the metric (6.22) describes the euclidean theory,
the lorentzian theory is obtained by changing p3
2. notice
that this is not the same as the wick rotation that leads to the near extremal black
hole solution (3.98).

i  dt2 + dx2

i=1 dx2

from the point of view of qcd3, the radius r0 of the compactifying circle provides
the ultraviolet cuto scale. to obtain large n qcd3 itself (with innite cuto), one
has to take g2
4n  0 as r0  0 so that the three dimensional eective coupling
g2
3n = g2
3 is the classical
dimensionful coupling of qcd3. the eective dimensionless gauge coupling of qcd3
at the distance scale r0 is therefore gsn.

4n/(2r0) remains at the intrinsic energy scale of qcd3. g2

the proposal is that type iib string theory on the ads black hole background (6.22)
provides a dual description to qcd3 (with the uv cuto described above). the limit
in which the classical supergravity description is valid, gsn  1, is the limit where
the typical mass scale of qcd3, g2
3n, is much larger than the cuto scale 1/r0. it is
the opposite of the limit that is required in order to see the ultraviolet freedom of the
theory. therefore, with the currently available techniques, we can only study large n
qcd3 with a xed ultraviolet cuto r1
in the strong coupling regime. it should be
0
emphasized that by strong coupling we mean here that the coupling is large compared
to the cuto scale, so we really have many more degrees of freedom than just those of
qcd3. qcd3 is the theory which we would get in the limit of vanishing bare coupling,
which is the opposite limit to the one we are taking.

this is analogous to, but not the same as, the lattice strong coupling expansion with
a xed cuto given by the lattice spacing a (which is analogous to r0 here). there,

4the stability issue of this background is discussed in [644].

197

qcd3 is obtained in the limit g2
3a  0 while strong coupling lattice qcd3 is the
theory at large g2
3a. an important dierence in the approach that we take, compared
to the lattice description, is that we have full lorentz invariance in the three gauge
theory coordinates. the regularization of the gauge theory in the dual string theory
description is provided by a one higher dimensional theory, the theory on d3 branes.
in the limit r0  0 the geometry (6.22) is singular. as discussed above, in this
limit the supergravity description is not valid and we have to use the string theory
description.

connement

as we noted before, the gauge coupling of qcd3 g2
3 has dimensions of mass, and it
provides a scale already for the classical theory. the eective dimensionless expansion
parameter at a length scale l, g2
3, goes to zero as l  0. therefore, like qcd4,
the theory is free at short distances. similarly, at a large length scale l the eective
coupling becomes strong. therefore, the interesting ir physics is non-perturbative.

3(l)  lg2

in three dimensions the coulomb potential is already conning. this is a logarithmic
connement v (r)  ln(r). lattice simulations provide evidence that in qcd3 at large
distances there is connement with a linear potential v (r)  r.

to see connement in the dual description we will consider the spatial wilson loop.
in a conning theory the vacuum expectation value of the wilson loop operator exhibits
an area law behavior [645]

hw (c)i  exp(a(c)) ,

(6.25)

where a(c) is the area enclosed by the loop c. the constant  is called the string
tension. the area law (6.25) is equivalent to the quark-antiquark conning linear
potential v (l)  l. this can be simply seen by considering a rectangular loop c
with sides of length t and l in euclidean space as in gure 6.2. for large t we have,
when v (l)  l and interpreting t as the time direction,

hw (c)i  exp(t v (l))  exp(a(c)) .

(6.26)

the prescription to evaluate the vacuum expectation value of the wilson loop oper-
ator in the dual string description has been introduced in section 3.5. it amounts to
computing

hw (c)i =z exp((d)) ,

(6.27)

where (d) is the regularized area of the worldsheet of a string d bounded at innity
by c.

l

figure 6.2: a conning quark-antiquark linear potential v (l)  l can be extracted
from the wilson loop obeying an area law hw (c)i  exp(t l).

we will work in the supergravity approximation in which (6.27) is approximated by

hw (c)i = exp((d)) ,

(6.28)

where (d) is the minimal area of a string worldsheet d bounded at innity by c.

this prescription has been applied in section 3.5 to the calculation of the wilson
loop in the n = 4 theory which is not a conning theory. indeed, it has been found
there that it exhibits a coulomb like behavior. the basic reason was that when we
scaled up the loop c by xi  xi with a positive number , we could use conformal
invariance to scale up d without changing its (regularized) area. therefore d was not
proportional to a(c). when scaling up the loop the surface d bends in the interior of
the ads space. in the case when such a bending is limited by the range of the radial
coordinate one gets an area law. this is the case in the models at hand, in which the
coordinate u in (6.22) is bounded from below by u0 as in gure 6.3.

the evaluation of the classical action of the string worldsheet bounded by the loop c
at innite u is straightforward, as done in section 3.5 [646, 647]. the string minimizes
its length by going to the region with the smallest possible metric component gii (where
i labels the r3 directions), from which it gets the contribution to the string tension.
the smallest value of gii in the metric (6.22) is at the horizon. thus, we nd that
the wilson loop exhibits an area law (6.25), where the string tension is given by the
gii component of the metric (6.22) evaluated at the horizon u = u0 times a numerical
factor 1

figure 6.3: the worldsheet of the string d is bounded at innite u by the loop c.
the string tends to minimize its length by going to the region with smallest metric
component gii, which in this case is near the horizon u = u0. the energy between the
quark and the antiquark is proportional to the distance l between them and to the
string tension which is  = 1

2 gii(u0).

the way supergravity exhibits connement has an analog in the lattice strong cou-
pling expansion, as rst demonstrated by wilson [645]. the leading contribution in
the lattice strong coupling expansion to the string tension is the minimal tiling by pla-
quettes of the wilson loop c as we show in gure 6.4. this is analogous to the minimal
area of the string worldsheet d ending on the loop c in gure 6.3. one important
dierence is that in the supergravity description the space is curved. of course, a
computation analogous to the wilson loop computations we described in section 3.5
which would be done in at space would also exhibit connement, since the minimal
area of the string worldsheet d ending on the loop c is simply the area enclosed by
the loop itself.

the quark-antiquark linear potential v = l can have corrections arising from the
uctuations of the thin tube (string) connecting the quark and antiquark. luscher
studied a leading correction to the quark-antiquark potential at large separation l.
within a class of bosonic eective theories in at space that describe the vibrations of
the thin ux tubes he found a universal term, c/l, called a luscher term [648] :

v = l  c/l .

(6.30)

for a ux tube in d space-time dimensions c = (d  2)/24. lattice qcd calculations
of the heavy quark potential have not provided yet a denite conrmation of this
subleading term. this term can also not been seen order by order in the lattice strong

coupling expansion. subleading terms is this expansion are of the non minimal tiling
type, as in gure 6.5, and correct only the string tension but not the linear behavior
of the potential.

analog of the uctuations of the string worldsheet.

the computation of the vacuum expectation value of the wilson loop (6.28) based
on the minimal area of the string worldsheet d does not exhibit the luscher term
[649]. this is not surprising. even if the the luscher term exists in qcd3, it should
originate from the uctuations of the string worldsheet (6.27) that have not been taken
into account in (6.28). some analysis of these uctuations has been done in [292], but
the full computation has not been carried out yet.

other works on connement as seen by a dual supergravity description are [650, 651,

652, 291].

mass spectrum

if the dual supergravity description is in the same universality class as qcd3 it should
exhibit a mass gap. in the following we will demonstrate this property. we will also
compute the spectrum of lowest glueball masses in the dual supergravity description.
they will resemble qualitatively the strong coupling lattice picture. we will also discuss
a possible comparison to lattice results in the continuum limit.

the mass spectrum in pure qcd can be obtained by computing the correlation
functions of gauge invariant local operators (glueball operators) or wilson loops, and
looking for the particle poles. as we discussed extensively before, correlation functions
of local operators are related (in some limit) to tree level amplitudes in the dual su-
pergravity description. we will consider the two point functions of glueball operators
o (for instance, we could take o = tr(f 2)). for large |x  y| it has an expansion of
the form
(6.31)

ho(x)o(y)i x ciexp(mi|x  y|) ,

where mi are called the glueball masses.

we will classify the spectrum of glueballs by j p c where j is the glueball spin, p its
parity and c its charge conjugation eigenvalue. the action of c on the gluon elds is
[653]

(6.32)

c : aa

t a

ij  aa

t a

ij ,

where the t as are the hermitian generators of the gauge group.
in string theory,
charge conjugation corresponds to the worldsheet parity transformation changing the
orientation of the open strings attached to the d-branes.

consider rst the lowest mass glueball state.

it carries 0++ quantum numbers.
one has to identify a corresponding glueball operator, namely a local gauge invariant
operator with these quantum numbers. the lowest dimension operator with these
properties is tr(f 2), and we have to compute its two point function. to do that we
need to identify rst the corresponding supergravity eld that couples to it as a source
at innite u. this is the type iib dilaton eld .

the correspondence between the gauge theory and the dual string theory picture
asserts that in the sugra limit the computation of the correlation function amounts
to solving the eld equation for  in the ads black hole background (6.22),

(gg) = 0 .

(6.33)

in order to nd the lowest mass modes we consider solutions of  which are inde-
pendent of the angular coordinate  and take the form  = f (u)eikx. plugging this in
(6.33) we obtain the dierential equation

u[u(u4  u4

0)uf (u)] + m 2uf (u) = 0, m 2 = k2 .

(6.34)

202

the eigenvalues m 2 of this equation are the glueball masses squared.

at large u equation (6.34) has two independent solutions, whose asymptotic behavior
is f  constant and f  1/u4. we consider normalizable solutions and choose the
second one. regularity requires the vanishing of the derivative of f (u) at the horizon.
the eigenvalues m 2 can be determined numerically [654, 655, 656], or approximately
via wkb techniques [654, 657].

one nds that:

(i) there are no solutions with eigenvalues m 2  0.
(ii) there is a discrete set of eigenvalues m 2 > 0.

this exhibits the mass gap property of the supergravity picture. in fact, even without
an explicit solution of the eigenvalues m 2 of equation (6.34), the properties (i) and (ii)
can be deduced from the structure of the equation and the requirement for normalizable
and regular solutions [182].

the 0++ mass spectrum in the wkb approximation closely agrees with the more

accurate numerical solution. it takes the form

m 2

0++ 

1.44n(n + 1)

r2
0

,

n = 1, 2, 3,   .

(6.35)

the mass spectrum (6.35), that corresponds to a massless mode of the string in ten
dimensions, is proportional to the cuto 1/r0 and not to 1/2, which is bigger by a
power of gsn (6.29). this is qualitatively similar to what happens in strong coupling
lattice qcd with lattice spacing a. as we will discuss in the next section, in the strong
coupling lattice qcd description the lowest masses of glueballs are proportional to 1/a.
note that in a stringy description of qcd we would expect the glueballs to correspond
to string excitations, which are expected to have masses of order 1/2. therefore in the
supergravity limit, gsn  1, the glueballs that correspond to the string excitations
are much heavier than the supergravity glueballs which we analyzed.
the natural scale for the glueball masses of continuum qcd3 is g2

3n. therefore
to get to the continuum qcd3 region we have to require g2
3n  1/r0 which implies
gsn  1. as discussed above, our computation is performed in the opposite limit
gsn  1. in particular, we do not have control over possible mixing between glueball
states and the other scalars and fermionic degrees of freedom which are at the same
mass scale 1/r0 in the eld theory.

we can attempt a numerical comparison of the supergravity computations with the
continuum limit of lattice qcd, obtained by taking the bare coupling to zero. since
these are computations at two dierent limits of the coupling value (of the original
n = 4 theory) there is apriori no reason for any agreement. curiously, it turns out
that ratios of the glueball excited state masses with n > 1 in (6.35) and the lowest mass
n = 1 state are in reasonably good agreement with the lattice computations (within

203

the systematic and statistical error bars) [654, 658].

as a second example consider the spectrum of 0 glueball masses. it can be com-
puted via the eld equations of the ns-ns 2-form eld. the details of the computation
can be found in [654] and, as in the 0++ case, the ratios of the glueball masses are found
to be in good agreement with the lattice computations.

in closing the numerical comparison we note another curious agreement between the
supergravity computation and the weak coupling lattice computations. this is for the
ratio of the lowest mass 0++ and 0 glueball states,

m0++(cid:17)supergravity
(cid:16) m0
m0++(cid:17)lattice
(cid:16) m0

= 1.50,

= 1.45  0.08 .

(6.36)

as stressed above, the regime where we would have liked to compute the mass
spectrum is in the limit of small gsn (or large ultraviolet cuto 1/r0). in this limit
the background is singular and we have to use the string theory description, which
we lack. we can compute the subleading correction in the strong coupling expansion
to the masses. this requires the inclusion of the 3 corrections to the supergravity
action. the typical form of the masses is

m 2 =

c0 + c13/r6

r2
0

,

(6.37)

with c0 as in (6.35). the background metric is modied by the inclusion of the 3r4
string correction to the supergravity action. the modied metric has been derived in
[282, 659]. based on this metric the corrections to the masses c1 have been computed in
[654]. while these corrections signicantly change the glueball masses, the corrections
to the mass ratios turn out to be relatively small.

lattice computations may exhibit lattice artifacts due to the nite lattice spacing.
removing them amounts to taking a suciently small lattice spacing such that eec-
tively the right physics of the continuum is captured. getting close to the continuum
means, in particular, that deviations from lorentz invariance are minimized.

analogous artifacts are seen in the dual supergravity description. they correspond
to kaluza-klein modes that are of the same mass scale as the glueball mass scale. there
are kaluza-klein modes from the circle coordinate  in (6.22) that provides the cuto
to the three dimensional theory. they have a typical mass scale of order 1/r0. there
are also so(6) non-singlet kaluza-klein modes from the ve-sphere in (6.22). in the
eld theory they correspond to operators involving the so(6) non-singlet scalar and
fermion elds of the high-energy theory. they have a mass scale of order 1/r0 too.

the inclusion of the subleading 3 correction does not make the kaluza-klein modes
suciently heavy to decouple from the spectrum [660, 654]. this means that the dual

204

supergravity description is also capturing physics of the higher dimensions, or of the
massive scalar and fermion elds from the point of view of qcd3. one hopes that upon
inclusion of all the  corrections, and taking the appropriate limit of small gsn (or
large cuto 1/r0), these kaluza-klein modes will decouple from the system and leave
only the gauge theory degrees of freedom. currently, we do not have control over the
 corrections, which requires an understanding of a two dimensional sigma model with
a rr background. in section 6.2.3 we will use an analogy with lattice eld theory to
improve on our supergravity description and remove some of the kaluza-klein modes.

6.2.2 qcd4

one starting point for obtaining qcd4 is the (2, 0) superconformal theory in six dimen-
sions realized on n parallel coinciding m5-branes, which was discussed in section 6.1.
the compactication of this theory on a circle of radius r1 gives a ve-dimensional the-
ory whose low-energy eective theory is the maximally supersymmetric su(n) gauge
theory, with a gauge coupling constant g2
5 = 2r1. to obtain qcd4, one compacties
this theory further on another s1 of radius r0. the dimensionless gauge coupling con-
stant g4 in four dimensions is given by g2
5/(2r0) = r1/r0. as in the previous
case, to break supersymmetry one imposes the anti-periodic boundary condition on the
fermions around the second s1. and, as in the previous case, to really get qcd4 we
need to require that the typical mass scale of qcd states, qcd, will be much smaller
than the other mass scales in our construction (1/r1 and 1/r0), and this will require
going beyond the supergravity approximation. however, one can hope that the theory
obtained from the supergravity limit will be in the same universality class as qcd4,
and we will give some evidence for this.

4 = g2

as discussed in section 6.1, the large n limit of the six-dimensional theory is m
theory on ads7  s4. upon compactication on the two circles and imposing anti-
periodic boundary conditions for the fermions on the second s1, we get m theory on
a black hole background [182]. taking the large n limit while keeping the t hooft
parameter 2 = g2
4n nite requires r1  r0. we can now use the duality between
m theory on a circle and type iia string theory, and the m5 brane wrapping on the
s1 of radius r1 becomes a d4 brane. the large n limit of qcd4 then becomes type
iia string theory on the black hole geometry given by the metric

the horizon is at u = u0, which is related to the radius r0 of the compactifying circle
as

u0 =

.

(6.40)

equivalently, we could have started with the ve dimensional theory on the world-
volume of n d4 branes and heated it up to a nite temperature t = 1/2r0. indeed,
the geometry (6.38) with the dilaton background (6.39) is the near horizon geometry
of the non-extremal d4 brane background. but again, when we wick rotate (6.38)
back to lorentzian signature we take one of the coordinates xi as time. notice that
the string coupling (6.39) goes as 1/n.

connement

qcd4 at large distances is expected to conne with a linear potential v (r)  r
between non-singlet states. therefore, the vacuum expectation value of the wilson
loop operator is expected to exhibit an area law behavior. in order to see this in the
dual description we follow the same procedure as in qcd3.

the string tension  is given by the coecient of the term p4

(6.38), evaluated at the horizon u = u0, times a 1

(6.41)

in qcd4 it is believed that connement is a consequence of the condensation of
magnetic monopoles via a dual meissner eect. such a mechanism has been shown to
occur in supersymmetric gauge theories in four dimensions [661]. this has also been
demonstrated to some extent on the lattice via the implementation of the t hooft
abelian projection [662]. we will now see that this appears to be the mechanism also
in the dual string theory description [285].

consider the ve dimensional theory on the world volume of the d4 branes. a
magnetic monopole is realized as a d2 brane ending on the d4 brane [162].
it is
a string in ve dimensions. upon compactication on a circle, the four dimensional
monopole is obtained by wrapping the string on the circle. we can now compute
the potential between a monopole and anti-monopole. this amounts to computing the
action of a d2-brane interpolating between the monopole and the anti-monopole, which
mediates the force between them as in gure 6.6(a). this is the electric-magnetic dual
of the computation of the quark-anti-quark potential described above.

if the pair is separated by a distance l in the x1 direction, and stretches along the
x2 direction (which we can interpret as the euclidean time), the d2 brane coordinates

206

are , x1, x2. the action per unit length in the x2 direction is given by

(6.42)

where g is the induced metric on the d2 brane worldvolume. we have to nd a
conguration of the d2-brane that minimizes (6.42). for l > lc where (up to a
numerical constant) lc  r0, there is no minimal volume d2 brane conguration
that connects the monopole and the anti-monopole and the energetically favorable
conguration is as in gure 6.6(b). therefore there is no force between the monopole
and the anti-monopole, which means that the magnetic charge is screened. at length
scales l  r0 we expect pure qcd4 as the eective description. we see that in this
region connement is accompanied by monopole condensation, as we expect.

the action of a d2-brane which mediates the force between them as in gure (a). for
l > lc there is no minimal volume d2 brane conguration that connects the monopole
and the anti-monopole and the energetically favorable conguration is as in gure (b),

 vacua

in addition to the gauge coupling, four dimensional gauge theories have an additional
parameter  which is the coecient of the tr(f  f ) term in the lagrangian. the 
angle dependence of asymptotically free gauge theories captures non trivial dynamical
information about the theory. unlike in spontaneously broken gauge theories, it cannot
be analyzed by an instanton expansion. what is required is an appropriate eective
description of the theories at long wavelengths. such an eective description is provided
by the lattice. however, since the lorentz invariance is lost by the discretization of
space time, it is very dicult to study questions such as the behavior of the system
under    + 2. also, the construction of instantons which are the relevant objects
in the analysis of the  dependence is a rather non trivial task and involves delicate
cooling techniques.

another eective description may be provided by the description of the four dimen-
sional gauge theories by the m5 brane wrapping a non supersymmetric cycle. indeed,
in this formalism, one sees that the vacuum energy exhibits the correct  angle behavior
in softly broken supersymmetric gauge theories [663].

in this subsection we use the dual string theory description to analyze the  angle
dependence in large n su(n) gauge theory [664]. since the amplitude for an instanton
is weighted by a factor exp(82n/) where  is the t hooft parameter (which we
keep xed), it naively seems that the instanton eects vanish as n  . however,
unlike the n = 4 gauge theory for instance, here one expects this not to be the case
due to ir divergences in the theory.

let us rst review what we expect the behavior of the  dependence to be from the

eld theory viewpoint. the yang-mills action is

iy m =z d4xtr(

n
4

f 2 +


162 f f ) .

(6.43)

at large n we expect the energy of the vacuum to behave like e() = n 2c(/n). the
n 2 factor is due to the fact that this is the order of the number of degrees of freedom
(this also follows from the standard scaling of the leading diagrams in the t hooft
limit). the dependence on /n follows from (6.43) as is implied by the large n limit.
 is chosen to be periodic with period 2. since the physics should not change under
   + 2 we require that e( + 2) = e().

these conditions cannot be satised by a smooth function of /n. they can be
satised by a multibranched function with the interpretation that there are n inequiv-
alent vacua, and all of them are stable in the large n limit. the vacuum energy is
then given by a minimization of the energy of the kth vacuum ek with respect to k

e() = min

ek() = n 2 min

figure 6.7: the energy of the vacuum is expected to be a multibranched function.

the function e() is periodic in  and jumps at some values of  between dierent
branches. the cp transformation acts by    and is a symmetry only for  = 0, .
therefore, c() = c(). one expects an absolute minimum at  = 0 and a non
vanishing of the second derivative of e() with respect to , which corresponds to the
topological susceptibility t of the system as we will discuss later. taking all these
facts into account one conjectures in the leading order in 1/n that [665]

e() = t min

( + 2k)2 + o(1/n) ,

k

(6.45)

where t is positive and independent of n. at  =  the function exhibits the jump
between the vacua at k = 0 and k = 1 and the spontaneous breaking of cp invariance.
in order to analyze the  dependence in the dual string theory description with the
background (6.38) we have to identify the  parameter. this is done by recalling that
the eective lagrangian of n d4 branes in type iia string theory has the coupling

1

162z d5xatr(ff) ,

(6.46)

where a is the type iia rr 1-form and f is the u(n) gauge eld strength on the
ve dimensional brane worldvolume. upon compactication of the d4 brane theory on
a circle we see that the four dimensional  parameter is related to the integral of the
rr 1-form on the circle. since it is a ten dimensional eld it is a parameter from the
worldvolume point of view.

in the dual description we dene the parameters at innite u. the  parameter is

dened as the integral of the rr 1-form component on the circle at innite u

 =z da = 2a

,

(6.47)

which is dened modulo 2k, k  z.

the required solution a (u) to (6.49), regular at u = u0 and with vanishing eld

strength at innite u (in order to have nite energy), takes the form

a (u) = a (1 

u6
0
u6 ) .

(6.50)

evaluating the type iia action for the rr 1-form (6.48) with the solution (6.50) and
recalling the 2z ambiguity we get the vacuum energy (6.45) where t is independent
of n [664].

in order to check that the vacua labeled by k are all stable in the limit n   we
need a way to estimate their lifetime. the domain wall separating two adjacent vacua
is constructed by wrapping a d6 brane of type iia string theory on the s4 part of the
metric [664]. since the energy density of the brane at weak coupling is of order 1/gs
where gs is the type iia string coupling, as n   (with xed gsn) it is of order n.
if we assume a mechanism for the decay of a k-th vacuum via a d6 brane bubble, its
decay rate is of the order of en . thus, there is an innite number of stable vacua in
the innite n limit.

one can repeat the discussion of connement in the previous subsection for  6= 0.
when  = 2p/q with co-prime integers p, q the connement is associated with a
condensation of (p, q) dyons and realizes the mechanism of oblique connement.

mass spectrum

the analysis of the mass spectrum of qcd4 as seen by the dual description in the
supergravity limit is similar to the one we carried out for qcd3. it is illuminating to
consider an analogous picture of strong coupling lattice qcd [285].

in strong coupling lattice qcd the masses of the lightest glueballs are of order 1/a
where a is the lattice spacing. the reasoning is that in strong coupling lattice qcd
the leading contribution to the correlator of two wilson loops separated by distance l
is from a tube with the size of one plaquette, as in gure 6.8, that connects the loops.
with the wilson lattice action the 0++ glueball mass is given by [666]

m0++ = 4 log(g2

4n)a1 .

figure 6.8: the leading contribution in strong coupling lattice qcd to the correlator
of two wilson loops, separated by distance l, is from a tube with the size of one
plaquette that connects the loops. this leads to the lowest mass glueballs having a
mass of the order of 1/a, where a is the lattice spacing.

to make the connection with continuum qcd4 we would like to sum the lattice
4n)a1, and take the limit a  0 and g4  0

(6.52)

where g4 is the four dimensional coupling and b is the rst coecient of the -function.
we hope that in the limit (6.52) we will get a nite glueball mass measured in qcd
units.

in the dual string theory description the analog of a is r0. the strong coupling
expansion is analogous to the  expansion of string theory. supergravity is the leading
contribution in this expansion. the lowest glueball masses mg correspond to the zero
modes of the string, and their mass is proportional to 1/r0. another way to see that
this limit resembles the strong coupling lattice qcd picture is to consider the wilson
loop correlation function hw (c1)w (c2)i as in gure 6.9(a).

for l > lc, where l is the distance between the loops and lc is determined by the
size of the loops, there is no stable string worldsheet conguration connecting the two
loops, as in gure 6.9(b). the string worldsheet that connects the loops as in gure
6.10(a) collapses and the two disks are now connected by a tube of string scale size as
in gure 6.10(b), resembling the strong coupling lattice qcd picture. the correlation
function is then mediated by a supergraviton exchange between the disks. thus, the
supergravitons are identied with the glueball states and the lowest glueball masses

211

turn out to be proportional to 1/r0 [285].

as in strong coupling lattice qcd, to make the connection with the actual qcd4

(6.53)

again, we hope that in the limit (6.53) we will get a nite glueball mass proportional
to qcd.

in the limit (6.53) the background (6.38) is singular. thus, to work at large n in
this limit we need the full tree level string theory description and not just the sugra
limit. the supergravity description will provide us with information analogous to
that of strong coupling lattice qcd with a nite cuto. however, since as discussed
before the regularization here is done via a higher dimensional theory, we will have the
advantage of a full lorentz invariant description in four dimensions. what we should
be worried about is whether we capture the physics of the higher dimensions as well
(which from the point of view of qcd4 correspond to additional charged elds).

in order to compute the mass gap we consider the scalar glueball 0++. the 0++
glueball mass spectrum is obtained by solving the supergravity equation for any mode

the two disks are now connected by a tube of a string scale as in gure (b). the
correlation function is mediated by a supergraviton exchange between the disks and
the supergravitons are identied with the glueball states.

f that couples to 0++ glueball operators; we expect (and this is veried by the calcu-
lation) that the lightest glueball will come from a mode that couples to the operator
tr(f 2). there are several steps to be taken in order to identify this mode and its
supergravity equation. first, we consider small uctuations of the supergravity elds
on the background (6.38), (6.39). the subtlety that arises is the need to disentangle
the mixing between the dilaton eld and the volume factor which has been done in
[667]. one then plugs the appropriate diagonal combinations of these elds into the
supergravity equations of motion. the eld/operator identication can then be done
by considering the born-infeld action of the d4 brane in the gravitational background.
to compute the lowest mass modes we consider solutions of the form f = f (u)eikx

which satisfy the equation

1
u3 u[u(u6  u6

0)uf (u)] + m 2f (u) = 0 .

(6.54)

the eigenvalues m 2 are the glueball masses. the required solutions are normalizable
and regular at the horizon. the eigenvalues m 2 can be determined numerically [667]
or approximately via wkb techniques [657].

as in qcd3 one nds that:

(i) there are no solutions with eigenvalues m 2  0.
(ii) there is a discrete set of eigenvalues m 2 > 0.

this exhibits the mass gap property of the supergravity picture.

213

the 0++ mass spectrum in the wkb approximation closely agrees with the more

accurate numerical solution. it takes the form

m 2 

0.74n(n + 2)

r2
0

,

n = 1, 2, 3,   .

(6.55)

as in qcd3, the ratios of the glueball excited state masses with n > 1 in (6.55) and the
lowest mass n = 1 state are in good agreement with the available lattice computations
[667, 654].

as another example consider the 0+ glueballs. the lowest dimension operator with
these quantum numbers is tr(f f ). as we discussed previously, on the d4 brane
worldvolume it couples to the rr 1-form a (6.46). its equation of motion is given by
(6.49). we look for solutions of the form a = f (u)eikx. plugging this into (6.49) we
get

1
u5 (u6  u6

0)u[u7uf (u)] + u4m 2f (u) = 0 .

(6.56)

as for the 0++ glueball states, the ratios of the 0+ glueball masses are found to be in
good agreement with the lattice computations [667].

finally, we note that the ratio of the lowest masses 0++ and 0+ glueball states [667]

(cid:18)m0+
m0++(cid:19)supergravity
(cid:18)m0+
m0++(cid:19)lattice

= 1.36  0.32 ,

(6.57)

agrees with the lattice results too. similar types of agreements in mass spectrum
computations were claimed in strong coupling lattice qcd [668]. however, note that
(as discussed above for qcd3) other ratios, such as the ratio of the glueball masses to
the square root of the string tension, are very dierent in the sugra limit from the
results in qcd.

the computation of the mass gap in the dual supergravity picture is in the opposite
limit to qcd. as in the supergravity description of qcd3, also here the kaluza-klein
modes do not decouple. in this approach, in order to perform the computation in the
qcd regime we need to use string theory. the surprising agreement of certain mass
ratios with the lattice results may be a coincidence. optimistically, it may have an
underlying dynamical reason.

connement-deconnement transition

we will now put the above four dimensional qcd-like theory at a nite temperature
t (which should not be confused with 1
). we will see that there is a deconnement
transition. in order to consider the theory at nite temperature we go to euclidean

2r0

214

space and we compactify the time direction te on a circle of radius  with antiperiodic
fermion boundary conditions. since we already had one circle (labeled by  in (6.38)),
we now have two circles with antiperiodic boundary conditions. so, we can have
several possible gravity solutions. one is the original extremal d4 brane, another
is the solution (6.38) and a third one is the same solution (6.38) but with  and
te interchanged. these last two solutions are possible only when the fermions have
antiperiodic boundary conditions on the corresponding circles. one of the last two
solutions always has lower free energy than the rst, so we concentrate on these last
two.

it turns out that the initial solution (6.38) has the lowest free energy for low tem-
peratures, when  = 1/t > 2r0, while the one with   te has the lowest free
energy for  = 1/t < 2r0 (high temperatures). the entropy of these two solutions
is very dierent, and therefore there is a rst order phase transition, in complete anal-
ogy with the discussion in section 3.6. we do not know of a proof that there are no
other solutions, but these two solutions have dierent topological properties, so there
cannot be a smoothly interpolating solution. in any case, for very low and very high
temperatures they are expected to be the dominant congurations (see [644])5. the
entropy of the the high temperature phase is of order n 2, while the entropy of the low
temperature phase is essentially zero since the number of states in the gravity picture
is independent of the newton constant.

if we compute the potential between a quark and an antiquark then in the low
temperature phase it grows linearly, so that we have connement, while in the high
temperature phase the strings coming from the external quarks can end on the horizon,
so that the potential vanishes beyond a certain separation. thus, this is a connement-
deconnement transition. it might seem a bit surprising at rst sight that essentially
the same solution can be interpreted as a conned and a deconned phase at the same
time. the point it that quark worldlines are timelike, therefore they select one of
the two circles, and the physical properties depend crucially on whether this circle is
contractible or not in the full ten-dimensional geometry.

other dynamical aspects

in this subsection we comment on various aspects of qcd4 as seen by the string
description. we rst show how the baryons appear in the dual string theory (m theory)
picture. we will then compute other properties of the qcd vacuum, the topological
susceptibility and the gluon condensate, as seen in the dual description.

baryons

5there are other singular solutions [601], but the general philosophy is that we do not allow singular

solutions unless we can give a physical interpretation for the singularity.

215

the baryon is an su(n) singlet bound state of n quarks. since we do not have
quarks in our theory, we need to put in external quarks as described in section 3.5,
and then there is a baryon operator coupling n external quarks. as in the conformal
case, also here it can be constructed as n open strings that end on a d4 brane that is
wrapped on s4 [285, 211], as in gure 6.11. if we view this geometry as arising from
m-theory, then the strings are m2 branes wrapping the circle with periodic fermion
boundary conditions and the d4 brane is an m5 vebrane also wrapping this circle.
then, n m2 branes can end on this m5 brane as in [211]. there is a very similar
picture of a baryon in strong coupling lattice qcd as is depicted in gure 6.12, where
quarks are connected by ux links to a vertex.

figure 6.11: the baryon is an su(n) singlet bound state of n quarks. it is constructed
as n open strings that join together at a point in the bulk ads black hole geometry.

several aspects of baryon physics can be seen from the string picture of gure 6.11
[211, 285]. the baryon energy is proportional to the string tension (6.41) and (in the
limit of large distances between the quarks) to the sum of the distances between the n
quark locations and the location of the baryon vertex in the four dimensional x-space
[285, 380, 381]. (there is some subtlety in evaluating the baryon energy, and it was
claried in [382] in the case of n = 4 gauge theory. see also [383, 387].) we may
consider the baryon vertex as a xed (non-dynamical) point in the born oppenheimer
approximation. in such an approximation, the n quarks move independently in the
potential due to the string stretched between them and the vertex. the baryon mass
spectrum can be computed by solving the one body problem of the quark in this
potential. corrections to this spectrum can be computed by taking into account the
potential between the quarks and the dynamics of the vertex. a similar analysis has
been carried out in the ux tube model [669] based on the hamiltonian strong coupling

216

figure 6.12: a baryon state in strong coupling lattice qcd. the quarks located at
lattice sites are connected by ux links to a vertex. a similar picture is obtained by
projecting the baryon vertex in gure 6.11 on x space.

lattice formulation [670].

in a conning theory we do not expect to see a baryonic conguration made from
k < n quarks. this follows for the above description. if we want to separate a quark
we will be left with a string running to innity, which has innite energy.

topological susceptibility
the topological susceptibility t measures the uctuations of the topological charge

of the qcd vacuum. it is dened by

t =

1

(162)2 z d4xhtr(f f (x))tr(f f (0))i .

(6.58)

at large n the witten-veneziano formula [671, 672] relates the mass m in su(n)
yang-mills gauge theory with nf quarks to the topological susceptibility of su(n)
yang-mills theory without quarks:

  n. in this limit m goes to zero

nevertheless, plugging the phenomenological values nf = 3, n = 3, m  1 gev, f 
0.1 gev in (6.59) leads to a prediction t  (180 mev )4, which is in surprising agree-
ment with the lattice simulation for a nite number of colors [673].

evaluating the 2-point function from the type iia sugra action for the rr 1-form

217

(6.48) with the solution (6.50), we get the topological susceptibility

t =

.

(6.60)

the supergravity result (6.60) depends on two parameters,  and r0. this is the
leading asymptotic behavior in 1/ of the full string theory expression t  (f ()/r0)4.
we would have liked to compute f (), take the limit (6.53) and compare to the lattice
qcd result. however, this goes beyond the currently available calculational tools.

it may be instructive, though, to consider the following comparison. let us assume
that there is a cross-over between the supergravity description and the continuum
qcd description. we can estimate the cross-over point. in perturbative qcd we nd
f ()  e12/11, therefore the cross-over point (to the f  3/4 behavior of (6.60))
can be estimated to be at   12/11. also, since the mass scale in the qcd regime is
qcd, at the cross-over point t = 1/2r0  qcd  200 mev . of course, we should
bear in mind that at the cross-over point both the supergravity and perturbative qcd
are not applicable descriptions. if we compare the topological susceptibility (6.60) at
the correspondence point with the lattice result we get

it may be an encouraging sign that the number we get is of order one, though its level
of agreement is not as good as the mass ratios of the glueball spectrum.

gluon condensation
the gluon condensate h 1

4g2

tr(f 2(0))i is related by the trace anomaly to the energy
density t of the qcd vacuum. in the supergravity picture the one point function of
an operator corresponds to the rst variation of the supergravity action. this quantity
is expected to vanish by the equations of motion. however, the rst variation is only
required to vanish up to a total derivative term. since asymptotically anti-de sitter
space has a time-like boundary at innity, there is a possible boundary contribution.
indeed, unlike the n = 4 case, the one point function of the tr(f 2) operator in the
dual string theory description of qcd does not vanish.

it can be computed either directly or by using the relation between the thermal
partition function and the free energy z(t ) = exp(f /t ). this relates the free
energy associated with the string theory (supergravity) background to the expectation
value of the operator tr(f 2). one gets [667]

the relation (6.62) between the gluon condensate and the string tension is rather
general and applies for other regular backgrounds that are possible candidates for a
dual description [674].

if we attempt again a numerical comparison with the lattice computation [675, 676]

we nd at the cross-over point

(gluon condensate)lattice !1/4

(6.63)

we should note that in eld theory the gluon condensate is divergent, and there are
subtleties (which are not completely settled) as to the relation between the lattice
regularized result and the actual property of the qcd vacuum.

finally, for completeness of the numerical status, we note that if we compare the

string tension (6.41) at the cross-over point and the lattice result we get

 (qcd string tension)sugra
(qcd string tension)lattice !1/2

6.2.3 other directions

in this subsection we briey review other possible ways of describing non supersym-
metric asymptotically free gauge theories via a dual string description. additional
possibilities are described in section 4.3.

dierent background metrics

the string models dual to qcdp that we studied exhibit the required qualitative prop-
erties, such as connement, a mass gap and the  dependence of the vacuum energy,
already in the supergravity approximation. we noted that besides the glueball mass
spectrum there exists a spectrum of kaluza-klein modes at the same mass scale. this
indicates that the physics of the higher dimensions is not decoupling from the four
dimensional physics6. the kaluza-klein states did not decouple upon the inclusion
of the 3 correction, but one hopes that they do decouple in the full string theory
framework. in the following we discuss an approach to removing some of them already
at the supergravity level. it should be stressed, however, that this does not solve the
issue of a possible mixing between the glueball states and states that correspond to
the scalar and fermion elds, which for large  are at the same mass scale in the eld
theory.

6from the eld theory point of view it indicates that su (4)-charged elds and kk modes of ve

dimensional elds contribute in addition to the four dimensional gluons.

219

again, the analogy with lattice gauge theory is useful. it is well known in the lattice
framework that the action one starts with has a signicant eect on the speed at which
one gets to the continuum limit. one can add to the lattice action deformations which
are irrelevant in the continuum limit and arrive at an appropriate eective description
of the continuum theory while having a larger lattice spacing. such actions are called
improved actions.

a similar strategy in the dual supergravity description amounts to a modication of
the background metric. the requirement is that the modication will better capture the
eective description of the gauge theory while still having a nite cuto (corresponding
to nite  in our case). on the lattice a criterion for improvement is lorentz invariance.
here, since the cuto is provided by a higher dimensional theory we have the full
lorentz invariance in any case. the improvement will be measured by the removal
of the kaluza-klein modes. note that we are attempting at an improvement in the
strong coupling regime. such ideas have only now begun to be explored on the lattice
[677]. till now, the eort of lattice computations was directed at the computation of
the strong coupling expansion series.

models that generalize the above background by the realization of the gauge theories
on non-extremal rotating branes have been studied in [678, 674, 311]. the deformation
of the background is parametrized by the angular momentum parameter. kaluza-
klein modes associated with the circle have the form  = f (u)eikxein , n > 0. it has
been shown that as one varies the angular momentum one decouples these kaluza-klein
modes, while maintaining the stability of the glueball mass spectrum. this deformation
is not sucient to decouple also the kaluza-klein modes associated with the sphere
part of the metrics (6.22) and (6.38), so we are still quite far from qcd.

the number of non-singular backgrounds is limited by the no hair theorem. one
may consider more angular momenta, for instance. however, this does not seem to
be sucient to decouple all the kaluza-klein states [679, 680].
it is possible that
we will need to appeal to non regular backgrounds in order to fully decouple the
higher dimensional physics. some non supersymmetric singular backgrounds of type
ii supergravity that exhibit connement were constructed and discussed in [408, 409,
410, 413].

type 0 string theory

the type 0 string theories have worldsheet supersymmetry but no space-time super-
symmetry as a consequence of a non-chiral gso projection [681, 682]. consider two
types of such string theories, type 0a and type 0b. they do not have space-time
fermions in their spectra. nevertheless, they have a modular invariant partition func-
tion. the bosonic elds of these theories are like those of the supersymmetric type

220

iia and type iib string theories, with a doubled set of ramond-ramond elds. type
0 string theories can be formally viewed as the high temperature limit of the type ii
string theories. they contain a tachyon eld t .

type 0 theories have d-branes. as in the type ii case, we can consider the gauge
theories on the worldvolume of n such branes. these theories do not contain an open
string tachyon. moreover, the usual condensation of the tachyon could be avoided in
the near horizon region as we explain below.

one particular example studied in [683] is the theory on n at d3 branes in type
0b theory. since there is a doubled set of rr 4-form elds in type 0b string theory,
the d3 branes can carry two charges, electric and magnetic. the worldvolume theory
theory of n at electric d3 branes is a u(n) gauge theory with six scalars in the
adjoint representation of the gauge group. there are no fermionic elds. the classical
action is derived by a dimensional reduction of the pure su(n) gauge theory action
in ten dimensions. the six scalars are the components of the gauge elds in the re-
duced dimensions. the classical theory has an so(6) global symmetry that rotates
the six scalars. this allows several possible parameters (from the point of view of
renormalizable eld theory) : a gauge coupling gy m , a mass parameter for the scalars
m and various scalar quartic potential couplings gi, one of which appears in the clas-
sical lagrangian. in the classical worldvolume action, the mass parameter is zero and
the gi are xed in terms of gy m , it is just the dimensional reduction of the ten dimen-
sional bosonic yang-mills theory. quantum mechanically, the parameters are corrected
dierently and can take independent values. the theory has a phase diagram depend-
ing on these parameters. generically we expect to see in the diagram coulomb-like
(higgs) phases, connement phases and maybe non trivial rg xed points arising from
particular tunings of the parameters.

as in the case of d branes in type ii theories, one can conjecture here that the
low-energy theory on the electric d3 branes has a dual non supersymmetric string
description. at rst sight this should involve a solution of ads5  s5 type. the closed
string tachyon might be allowed in ads if the curvature is of the order of the string
scale, since in that case the tachyon would obey the breitenlohner-freedman bound
(2.42). the fact that the curvatures are of the order of the string scale renders the
gravity analysis invalid. in principle we should solve the worldsheet string theory. since
we do not know how to do that at present we can just do a gravity analysis and hope
that the full string theory analysis will give similar results. it was observed in [683]
that the tachyon potential includes the terms

(6.65)

m2e2t 2 + |f|2 1 + t + t 2

2 ! ,

1
2

where f is the electric rr ve form eld strength (the magnetic one couples in a similar
way but with t  t ). the fact that the rr elds contribute positively to the mass

221

allows curvatures which, numerically, are a bit less than the string scale. furthermore,
it has been noticed in [684] that the rst string correction to this background seems
to vanish. these conditions on the curvature translate into the condition gsn < o(1)
which is precisely what we expect to get in qcd.

an interesting feature is that, due to the potential (6.65) the tachyon would have
a nonzero expectation value and that induces a variation of the dilaton eld  in the
radial coordinate via the equation [657, 684]

2 =

1
8

m2e/2t 2,

m2 = 

2


.

(6.66)

since the radial coordinate is associated with the energy scale of the gauge theory,
this variation may be interpreted as the ow of the coupling. in the uv (large radial
coordinate) the tachyon is constant and one nds a metric of the form ads5 s5. this
indicates a uv xed point. the coupling vanishes at the uv xed point, and this
makes the curvature of the gravity solution innite in the uv, but that is precisely
what is expected since the eld theory is uv free. the running of the coupling is
logarithmic, though it goes like 1/(log e)2. however, the quark-antiquark potential
goes as 1/ log e due to the square root in (3.95).

in the ir (small radial coordinate) the tachyon vanishes and one nds again a solution
of the form ads5  s5. in the ir the coupling is innite. therefore this solution seems
to exhibit a strong coupling ir xed point. however, since the dilaton is large, classical
string theory is not sucient to study the xed point theory. the gravity solution at
all energy scales u has not been constructed yet.

generically one expects the gauge theory to have dierent phases parametrized by
the possible couplings. the ir xed point should occur as a particular tuning of the
couplings. indeed, other solutions at small radial coordinate were constructed in [685]
that exhibit connement and a mass gap. moreover they were argued to be more
generic than the ir xed point solution.

it was pointed out in [686] that the theories on the d3 branes of type 0b string
theory are particular examples of the orbifold models of n = 4 theory that we studied
in section 4.1.1. the r-symmetry of n = 4 theory is su(4), the spin cover of so(6).
it has a center z4 and one can orbifold with respect to it or its subgroups . the
theory on n at electric d3 branes arises when the action of  on the chan-paton
(color) indices is in a trivial representation. this orbifold is not in the class of regular
representations which we discussed in section 4.1.1; in particular, in this case the beta
function does not vanish in the planar diagram limit. if we study instead the theory
arising on n self-dual d3-branes of type 0 (which may be viewed as bound states of
electric and magnetic d3-branes) we nd a theory which is in the class of regular
representation orbifolds [687], and behaves similarly to type ii d3-branes in the large
n limit. we will not discuss this theory here.

222

as with the d branes in type ii string theory, we can construct a large number of non
supersymmetric models in type 0 theories by placing the d branes at singularities. one
example is the theory of d3 branes of type 0b string theory at a conifold singularity.
as discussed in section 4.1.3, when placing n d3 branes of type iib string theory
at a conifold the resulting low-energy worldvolume theory is n = 1 supersymmetric
su(n)  su(n) gauge theory with chiral superelds ak, k = 1, 2 transforming in the
(n, n) representation and bl, l = 1, 2 transforming in the ( n, n) representation, and
with some superpotential.

on the worldvolume of n electric d3 branes of type 0b string theory at a conifold
there is a truncation of the fermions and one gets an su(n)  su(n) gauge theory
with complex scalar elds ak, k = 1, 2 transforming in the (n, n) representation and
bl, l = 1, 2 transforming in the ( n, n) representation. this theory (at least if we set to
zero the coecient of the scalar potential which existed in the supersymmetric case) is
asymptotically free. the gravity description of this model has been analyzed in [688].
in the uv one nds a solution of the form ads5  t 1,1 which indicates a uv xed
point. the eective string coupling vanishes in accord with the uv freedom of the
gauge theory. in the ir one nds again a solution of the form ads5 t 1,1 with innite
coupling that points to a strong coupling ir xed point. of course, one expects the
gauge theory to have dierent phases parametrized by the possible couplings. indeed,
there are other more generic solutions that exhibit connement and a mass gap [688].
other works on dual descriptions of gauge theories via the type 0 d branes are

[689, 690, 691, 692, 693, 694, 695].

chapter 7

summary and discussion

we conclude by summarizing some of the successes and remaining open problems of
the ads/cft correspondence.

from the eld theory point of view we have learned and understood better many
properties of the large n limit. since t hoofts work [3] we knew that the large n limit
of gauge theories should be described by strings, if the parameter g2
y m n is kept xed.
through the correspondence we have learned that not only does this picture really
work (beyond perturbation theory where it was rst derived), but that the yang-mills
strings (made from gluons) are the same as the fundamental strings. moreover, these
strings move in higher dimensions, as was argued in [44]. these extra dimensions
arise dynamically in the gauge theory. for some eld theories the curvatures in the
higher dimensional space could be small. the prototypical example is n = 4 super-
yang-mills with large n, g2
y m n. from this example we can obtain others by taking
quotients, placing branes at various singularities, etc. (section 4.1). in all cases for
which we can nd a low-curvature gravity description we can do numerous calculations
in the large n limit. we can calculate the spectrum of operators and states (sections
3.2, 3.4). we can calculate correlation functions of operators and of wilson loops
(sections 3.3, 3.5). we can calculate thermal properties, like the equation of state
(section 3.6), and so on.

if the eld theory is conformal the gravity solution will include an ads factor. it is
possible, in principle, to deform the theory by any relevant operators. in some cases
fairly explicit solutions have been found for ows between dierent conformal eld
theories (section 4.3). a c-theorem for eld theories in more than two dimensions
was proven within the gravity approximation. it would be very interesting to generalize
this beyond this approximation.
it would also be interesting to understand better
exactly what it is the class of eld theories which have a gravity approximation. one
constraint on such four dimensional conformal eld theories, described in section 3.2.2,
is that they must have a = c.

224

it is possible to give a eld theory interpretation to various branes that one can have
in the ads description (section 4.2). some correspond to baryons in the eld theory,
others to various defects like domain walls, etc. in the ads5 case d-instantons in the
string theory correspond to gauge theory instantons in the eld theory.

in general, the large n limit of a gauge theory should have a string theory descrip-
tion. whether it also has a gravity description depends on how large the curvatures
in this string theory are.
if the curvatures are small, we can have an approximate
classical gravity description. otherwise, we should consider all string modes on the
same footing. this involves solving the worldsheet theories for strings in ramond-
ramond backgrounds. this is a problem that only now is beginning to be elucidated
[510, 696, 697, 698, 699, 700, 701, 702, 703]. for non-supersymmetric qcd, or other
theories which are weakly coupled (as qcd is at high energies), we expect to have
curvatures at least of the order of the string scale, so that a proper understanding of
strings on highly curved spaces seems crucial.

it is also possible to deform the n = 4 eld theory, breaking supersymmetry and
conformal invariance, by giving a mass to the fermions or by compactifying the theory
on a circle with supersymmetry breaking boundary conditions. then, we have a theory
that should describe pure yang-mills theory at low energies (sections 4.3, 3.6, 6.2). in
the case of eld theories compactied on a circle with supersymmetry breaking bound-
ary conditions and large g2
y m n at the compactication scale, one can show that the
theory is conning, has a mass gap, has -vacua with the right qualitative properties
and has a connement-deconnement transition at nite temperature. however, in the
regime where the analysis can be done (small curvature) this theory includes many
additional degrees of freedom beyond those in the standard bosonic yang-mills the-
ory. in order to do quantitative calculations in bosonic yang-mills one would have to
do calculations when the curvatures are large, which goes beyond the gravity approx-
imation and requires understanding the propagation of strings in ramond-ramond
backgrounds. unfortunately, this is proving to be very dicult, and so far we have not
obtained new results in qcd from the correspondence. as discussed in section 6.2,
the gravity approximation resembles the strong coupling lattice qcd description [645],
where the  expansion of string theory corresponds to the strong coupling expansion.
the gravity description has an advantage over the strong coupling lattice qcd de-
scription by being fully lorentz invariant. this allows, for instance, the analysis of
topological properties of the vacuum which is a dicult task in the lattice description.
the ads/cft correspondence does provide direct evidence that qcd is describable
as some sort of string theory (to the extent that we can use the name string theory for
strings propagating on spaces whose radius of curvature is of the order of the string
scale or smaller).

one of the surprising things we learned about eld theory is that there are various

225

new large n limits which had not been considered before. for instance, we can take
n   keeping gy m xed, and the ads/cft correspondence implies that many
properties of the eld theory (like correlation functions of chiral primary operators)
have a reasonable limiting behavior in this limit, though there is no good eld theory
argument for this. similarly, we nd that there exist large n limits for theories which
are not gauge theories, like the d = 3,n = 8 and d = 6,n = (2, 0) superconformal
eld theories, and for various theories with less supersymmetry. the existence of these
limits cannot be derived directly in eld theory.

the correspondence has also been used to learn about the properties of eld theories
which were previously only poorly understood. for instance, it has been used [332] to
understand properties of two dimensional eld theories with singular target spaces, and
to learn properties of little string theories, like the fact that they have a hagedorn
behavior at high energies. the correspondence has also been used to construct many
new conformal eld theories, both in the large n limit and at nite n.

another interesting case is topological chern simons theory in three dimensions,
which is related to a topological string theory in six dimensions [318]. in this case one
can solve exactly both sides of the correspondence and see explicitly that it works.

the correspondence is also useful for studying non-conformal gauge theories, as we
discussed in section 6.1.3. a particularly interesting case is the maximally supersym-
metric quantum mechanical su(n) gauge theory, which is related to matrix theory
[23, 704, 705, 628, 706, 707, 708, 709, 710, 711, 712].

from the quantum gravity point of view we have now an explicit holographic de-
scription for gravity in many backgrounds involving an asymptotically ads space. the
eld theory eectively sums over all geometries which are asymptotic to ads. this
denes the theory non-perturbatively. this also implies that gravity in these spaces is
unitary, giving the rst explicit non-perturbative construction of a unitary theory of
quantum gravity1, albeit in a curved space background. black holes are some mixed
states in the eld theory hilbert space. explicit microscopic calculations of black hole
entropy and greybody factors can be done in the ads3 case (chapter 5).

basic properties of quantum gravity, such as approximate causality and locality at
low energies, are far from clear in this description [178, 271, 168, 176, 174, 713, 179],
and it would be interesting to understand them better. we are also still far from having
a precise mapping between general congurations in the gravitational theory and in
the eld theory (see [714, 175] for some attempts to go in this direction).

in principle one can extract the physics of quantum gravity in at space by taking
the large radius limit of physics in ads space. since we have not discussed this yet

1in the context of matrix theory [23] we need to take a large n limit which is not well understood

in order to describe a theory of gravity in a space with no closed light-like curves.

226

in the review, let us expand on this here, following [715, 716, 177, 717] (see also [175,
718, 719, 720]). we would like to be able to describe processes in at space which
occur, for instance, at some xed string coupling, with the energies and the size of the
interaction region kept xed in string (or planck) units. computations on ads space
are necessarily done with some nite radius of curvature; however, we can view this
radius of curvature as a regulator, and take it to innity at the end of any calculation,
in such a way that the local physics remains the same. let us discuss what this means
for the ads5  s5 case (the discussion is similar for other cases). we need to keep the
string coupling xed, and take n   since the radius of curvature in planck units is
proportional to n 1/4. note that this is dierent from the t hooft limit, and involves
taking   . in order to describe a scattering process in space-time which has nite
energies in this limit, it turns out that the energies in the eld theory must scale as
n 1/4 (measured in units of the scale of the s3 which the eld theory is compactied
on; we need to work in global ads coordinates to describe at-space scattering). in
this limit the eld theory is very strongly coupled and the energies are also very high,
and there are no known ways to do any computations on the eld theory side.
it
would be interesting to compute anything explicitly in this limit. for example, it
would be interesting to compute the entropy of a small schwarzschild black hole, much
smaller than the radius of ads, to see at-space hawking radiation, and so on. if we
start with ads5  s5 this limit gives us the physics in at ten dimensional space, and
similarly starting with ads4  s7 or ads7  s4 we can get the physics in at eleven
dimensional space. it would be interesting to understand how the correspondence can
be used to learn about theories with lower dimension, where some of the dimensions
are compactied. a limit of string theory on ads3  s3  m 4 may be used to give
string theory on r5,1  m 4, but it is not clear how to get four dimensional physics out
of the correspondence.
one could, in principle, get four dimensional at space by starting from ads2  s2
compactications. however, the correspondence in the case of ads2 spaces is not
well understood. ads2 spaces arise as the near horizon geometry of extremal charged
reissner-nordstrom black holes. even though elds propagating in ads2 behave sim-
ilarly to the higher dimensional cases [721], the problem is that any nite energy
excitation seems to destroy the ads2 boundary conditions [331]. this is related to
the fact that black holes (as opposed to black p-branes, p > 0) have an energy gap
(see section 5.7), so that in the extreme low energy limit we seem to have no exci-
tations. one possibility is that the correspondence works only for the ground states.
even then, there are instantons that can lead to a fragmentation of the spacetime into
several pieces [722]. some conformal quantum mechanics systems that are, or could
be, related to ads2 were studied in [723, 724, 725, 711]. aspects of hawking radiation
in ads2 were studied in [726].

227

in all the known cases of the correspondence the gravity solution has a timelike
boundary2. it would be interesting to understand how the correspondence works when
the boundary is light-like, as in minkowski space. it seems that holography must work
quite dierently in these cases (see [727, 728] for discussions of some of the issues in-
volved). in the cases we understand, the asymptotic space close to the boundary has
a well dened notion of time, which is the one that is associated to the gauge the-
ory. it would be interesting to understand how holography works in other spacetimes,
where we do not have this notion of time. interesting examples are spatially closed
universes, expanding universes, de-sitter spacetimes, etc. see [729, 730, 731, 732] for
some attempts in this direction. the precise meaning of holography in the cosmological
context is still not clear [733, 734, 735, 736, 737, 738, 739].

to summarize, the past 18 months have seen much progress in our understanding of
string/m theory compactications on ads and related spaces, and in our understand-
ing of large n eld theories. however, the correspondence is still far from realizing the
hopes that it initially raised, and much work still remains to be done. the correspon-
dence gives us implicit ways to describe qcd and related interesting eld theories in
a dual stringy description, but so far we are unable to do any explicit computations
in the eld theories that we are really interested in. the main hope for progress in
this direction lies in a better understanding of string theory in rr backgrounds. the
correspondence also gives us an explicit example of a unitary and holographic theory
of quantum gravity. we hope this example can be used to better understand quan-
tum gravity in at space, where the issues of unitarity (the information problem)
and holography are still quite obscure. even better, one could hope that the corre-
spondence would hint at a way to formulate string/m theory independently of the
background. these questions will apparently have to wait until the next millennium.
