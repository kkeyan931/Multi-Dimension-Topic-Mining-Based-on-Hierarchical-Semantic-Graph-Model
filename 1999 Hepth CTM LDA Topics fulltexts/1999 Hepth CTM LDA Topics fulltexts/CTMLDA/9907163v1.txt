abstract

the thermodynamic properties of schwarzschild-anti-de sitter black holes conned
within nite isothermal cavities are examined. in contrast to the schwarzschild case, the
innite cavity limit may be taken which, if suitably stated, remains double valued. this
allows the correspondence between non-existence of negative modes for classical solutions
and local thermodynamic stability of the equilibrium conguration of such solutions to
be shown in a well dened manner. this is not possible in the asymptotically at case.
furthermore, the non-existence of negative modes for the larger black hole solution in
schwarzschild-anti-de sitter provides strong evidence in favour of the recent positive energy
conjecture by horowitz and myers.

1 introduction

it is well known that if the free energy of a system has an imaginary component, then that
system is meta-stable and may decay via some mechanism in a rst-order phase transition.
this eect is well illustrated in, for example, the treatment of hot at space in four dimensions
given by gross, perry, and yae [1]. in their analysis, the authors demonstrate that at space
at zero temperature is stable both classically and quantum-mechanically since the at space
metric , which is a true minimum of the action, is the unique classical solution about which
any saddle-point expansion may be made. in the case of at space at some non-zero temperature
t however, this is no longer true, since there exist other classical solutions with period  = 1/t ,
such as the euclidean section of the schwarzschild solution, which is not a true minimum of the
action.

the n = 4 dimensions euclidean schwarzschild solution is seen to possess a smooth  i.e.
monotonically decreasing in r  spherically symmetric metric perturbation which decreases the
euclidean action. the existence of this unique nonconformal negative mode demonstrates
that the schwarzschild solution is a saddle-point of the action rather than a true minimum,
and may be interpreted as a quantum-mechanical instability of hot at space since nearby
geometries contribute an imaginary component to the free energy f = 1/ log z of the
system. this permits, at any non-zero temperature, the spontaneous excitation of hot at
space over an eective potential barrier and the subsequent nucleation of black holes with a rate
proportional to the imaginary component. this process may be viewed as a phase transition
through topologies with euler characteristic  = 0 to  = 2, and is purely quantum in nature
with no classical analogue.

the authors conclude, therefore, that asymptotically at space at any non-zero tempera-
ture t is quantum mechanically unstable due to the spontaneous nucleation of black holes with
mass m = 1/8t . this conclusion is essentially in agreement with the idea that the canonical
ensemble in hot at space is pathological when gravitational eects are taken into considera-
tion, although in the form given by gross et al. the nucleation process is understood to be
thermodynamically inconsistent.

the above results pertain to black hole nucleation in hot at space conned to a large
ideal isothermal cavity  essentially in the limit of innite volume. however, a far deeper
understanding of black hole thermodynamics and the nucleation process is aorded by instead
considering cavities with nite volume [2, 3]. in this approach, due to york [4], the canonical
ensemble is constructed from elements which are ideal isothermal boxes of invariant surface
area ab = 4r2
b and wall temperature tb. the euclidean einstein equations with canonical
boundary conditions then admit either zero black hole solutions if the product rbtb < 27/8,
or else two distinct black hole solutions which are degenerate at equality. the larger of the
black hole solutions is locally thermodynamically stable  i.e. has positive heat capacity, and
may also have negative free energy, but it does not have mass 1/8tb. the mass of the smaller
black hole does approach 1/8tb in the limit of large rb, but it is thermodynamically unstable
and has positive free energy.

these observations allowed york to give a consistent interpretation of the black hole nucle-
ation process in a nite cavity. in a spontaneous process such as that proposed the relevant
thermodynamic potential  the free energy in the canonical ensemble  cannot increase, and
so it is the larger thermodynamically stable black hole which may form by nucleation. the
positive free energy of the smaller hole acts as the eective potential barrier.

a further advantage of this approach to black hole thermodynamics is that it demonstrates a
clear equivalence between the requirements for local thermodynamic stability of an equilibrium
conguration in the canonical ensemble and the requirements for local dynamic stability of the
classical solutions. this correspondence may be demonstrated using the reduced action i

1

derived by whiting and york [5]. whiting [6] shows explicitly that, at equilibrium, the second
derivative of the reduced action with respect to the horizon radius is positive  and so the action
is a local minimum rather than a saddle point  only in the region where the heat capacity is
positive. this is when the cavity radius satises the constraint r+ < rb < 3r+/2 where r+ is
the horizon radius.

analysis of the euclidean schwarzschild nonconformal negative mode is extended to isother-
mal cavities of nite volume by allen [7], who nds that the mode persists until the cavity radius
rb falls below some critical radius rcrit  2.89 r+/2. the non-existence of a negative mode for a
classical solution is a clear indication of local dynamic stability with respect to small perturba-
tions of the background, and provides the same criterion on the action as the second derivative
of i with respect to the horizon radius. it should likewise correspond to the sign of the heat
capacity, but there is clearly some small amount of disagreement here. this is at least partly
due to allens choice of boundary conditions: invariant cavity radius rb rather than invariant
surface area ab, but as york has pointed out [4], this implies that the eigenvalue spectrum of the
negative mode is not calculated at an extremum of the action. in fact, the boundary conditions
for calculating this spectrum depend explicitly on the magnitude of the metric perturbation in
the interior region. it would appear, therefore, that in a nite isothermal cavity there can be no
well dened way of relating the local dynamics of a classical solution in terms of the eigenvalue
spectrum with the local thermodynamics of the equilibrium conguration. of course, the orig-
inal calculation of the negative mode eigenvalue in the innite volume case is properly dened:
there is no choice in the boundary conditions. however this demonstrates only that a dynamic
instability exists when the heat capacity is negative, not that the instability vanishes when the
solution becomes thermodynamically stable. in the limit rb   the radius above which this
occurs becomes innite, and the solution with positive heat capacity does not exist.
the characteristics of the canonical ensemble in hot at space conned to a nite cavity may
be contrasted with those in the presence of a negative cosmological constant. for this purpose,
yorks thermodynamic analysis is extended to the case of asymptotically anti-de sitter black
holes by brown, creighton and mann [8], who study their properties in both two and three
spatial dimensions. in the case of three spatial dimensions the results are qualitatively similar
to at space:
for a given invariant surface area ab there will exist either zero or two black
hole solutions to the euclidean einstein equations with canonical boundary conditions. if the
constant boundary temperature tb is chosen such that two distinct solutions exist, then the
larger black hole will be thermodynamically stable and the smaller black hole will be unstable.
a key dierence between the two cases, however, lies in the behaviour of the heat capacity. in
schwarzschild-anti-de sitter this is positive when the radius of the cavity satises the constraint

r+ < rb < f (r+), where f (r+)   as r+  b/3 from below, with f (r+) =  for r+ > b/3.

this means that in the limit of the cavity becoming innite, and with an appropriate rescaling
of the temperature on the boundary wall, there will still exist two well-dened black hole
solutions to the euclidean einstein equations: one locally thermodynamically stable and the
other unstable. in fact, if suitably stated, all of the physical characteristics of the solutions are
retained in this limit, and the situation recovered is formally identical to that which is analysed
by hawking and page [9].

in their approach, these authors identify the temperature xed at innity with the inverse
of the periodicity  in the imaginary-time direction. the temperature then has a minimum
value t0, below which there are no black hole solutions and above which there are two. they
conjecture that, like schwarzschild, the schwarzschild-anti-de sitter solution should have a single
nonconformal negative mode, but only when r+ < r0 where r0 = b/3  the horizon radius of
the unique black hole solution with temperature t0. they further conjecture that the negative
mode should pass through zero at r+ = r0, and that for solutions with horizon radius greater
than this, no nonconformal negative modes should exist. this strongly suggests that the action

2

of the larger solution, should it be negative, is in fact a global minimum of the action functional
for asymptotically anti-de sitter metrics periodically identied in imaginary time.

the objective of this work is to conrm these conjectures by explicitly calculating the eigen-
value spectrum for the nonconformal negative mode in schwarzschild-anti-de sitter. since the
boundary of the cavity is at innity this calculation is inherently independent of the magnitude
of the metric perturbation. it will therefore provide a well dened demonstration of the corre-
spondence between the local dynamic stability of a classical solution in terms of the existence of
a negative mode and the local thermodynamic stability of the equilibrium conguration in the
canonical ensemble. it would seem that this is only possible when the cosmological constant is
non-zero.

the paper proceeds as follows: the next section is devoted to a review of the thermo-
dynamic properties of both asymptotically at and asymptotically anti-de sitter black holes
conned within a nite ideal isothermal cavity. for simplicity the analysis is quite graphical,
and attention is restricted to the case of three spatial dimensions only. section three briey
discusses the theory behind one-loop contributions to the partition function in the path-integral
approach to quantum gravity, and denes the physical gauge independent operator g acting
on transverse and trace-free metric perturbations. the eigenvalue equation for this operator
acting on spherically symmetric modes reduces to a second order o.d.e. in the radial coor-
dinate. in section four this equation is obtained in a general form suitable for asymptotically
at and asymptotically anti-de sitter solutions in any dimension n  4. section ve discusses
the numerical solution of this equation for schwarzschild-anti-de sitter in n = 4 dimensions
and demonstrates the stated correspondence with the heat capacity. this is then extended to
higher dimensions in section six. the nal section discusses the relevance of these observations
to more recent work involving anti-de sitter spaces, and in particular to the positive energy
conjecture for periodically identied anti-de sitter suggested by horowitz and myers [10]. the
non-existence of a negative mode for the thermodynamically stable schwarzschild-anti-de sitter
black hole provides strong evidence in favour of this proposal.

2 thermodynamic properties of black holes in finite

isothermal cavities

in three spatial dimensions, the euclidean schwarzschild solution takes the well known form

ds2 = v (r) d 2 +

1

v (r)

dr2 + r2 d2

(2.1)

where the metric function v (r) = 1  r+/r, with r+ = 2m. clearly this solution is positive-
denite only for values of r greater than r+, and a coordinate singularity occurs in the (, r)
plane at r = r+. the s2 at this point may be included in the euclidean section if, in the
conventional manner, the coordinate  is identied periodically with a period of

 =

= 4r+.

(2.2)

since the killing vector / is naturally normalised to 1 in the limit of large r, the temperature
measured at innity may be formally identied with the inverse of this period. the tolman law
then states that for any static self-gravitating system in thermal equilibrium, a local observer
at rest will measure a local temperature t which scales as g1/2
. in the present context, then,
the constant of proportionality is t = 1/.

a schwarzschild black hole conned within an ideal isothermal cavity. also shown are the
lines r+ = rb and 2rb/3, between which the heat capacity ca is positive. the broken line is
r+ = 8rb/9, above which the free energy is negative.

with this in mind, york [4] denes the elements of the canonical ensemble for hot at space
to be ideal isothermal cavities of invariant surface area ab = 4r2
b and wall temperature tb.
one topologically regular solution to the einstein equations with these boundary conditions is
hot at space with a uniform temperature of tb throughout the cavity. another solution is the
schwarzschild metric. if a black hole of horizon radius r+ < rb does exist within the cavity
then clearly, from the tolman law, the wall temperature must satisfy

tb

def= t (rb) = (4r+)1 (1  r+/rb)1/2.

(2.3)

this equation may be solved for r+ in terms of the constants rb and tb.
if the product
rbtb < 27/8 then there are no real positive solutions for r+. in this part of the (tb, rb)
plane no black holes exist. if this inequality is not satised then in general two distinct solutions
exist, which join smoothly at equality where r+ = 2rb/3. figure 1 shows this curve as a constant
temperature slice through the (tb, rb, r+) surface.

the diagram is to be interpreted as follows: for some given wall temperature tb the solution
curve will appear as shown. if the scale of rb along the horizontal axis is kept xed, then for
higher wall temperatures the solution curve shifts to the left, and for lower wall temperatures
it shifts to the right. the turning point of the curve, where rbtb = 27/8, remains on the
line r+ = 2rb/3. it is clear therefore that for any cavity radius to the right of this point there
will be two distinct schwarzschild black hole solutions  one above this line and one below it.
for any values of rb and tb, the entropy of the black hole solutions to (2.3) is s = r2
+.
the heat capacity at constant surface area  the analogue in this context of cv  may therefore

(2.4)

hence, if r+ < rb < 3r+/2 the heat capacity is positive and the equilibrium conguration is
locally thermodynamically stable. as gure 1 shows, this is always the case for the larger black
hole solution.

a far deeper understanding of the thermodynamics of black holes in nite cavities, and the
associated roles of both classical and non-classical geometries within the canonical ensemble, is
aorded by considering the reduced action i proposed by whiting and york [5, 6, 11, 12].
this is the function obtained from the euclidean einstein action by considering only static
and spherically symmetric geometries which: i) are smooth and have  = 2 topology; ii) have
appropriate boundary data for the canonical ensemble; and iii) obey the constraints of the
einstein equations on a family of space-like hyper-surfaces which foliate the manifold.

with these requirements the reduced action becomes

i = b e  s

(2.5)

where b is the inverse wall temperature, s is the classical black hole entropy r2
+, and the
energy is chosen to be e = rb  rb (1  r+/rb)1/2. with this denition, then, both the energy
and the action of hot at space are zero.
it should be noted that the reduced action has the same form as the action evaluated for
a classical schwarzschild solution, except that the variables b, rb, and r+ are in this case all
independent rather than being related through (2.3). with this function, therefore, it is possible
to derive both the thermodynamic properties of the ensemble and the dynamic properties of
the classical solutions within the ensemble by varying with respect to the single remaining
degree of freedom r+. thus, for example, the stationary points satisfying i/r+ = 0 yield
b = (4r+)(1r+/rb)1/2, in agreement with the necessary classical requirement. furthermore,
at the stationary points,

(2.7)

the condition for local dynamic stability of the classical solution is therefore wholly equivalent
to the condition for local thermodynamic stability of the equilibrium conguration, where the
latter is shown to occur only within the range r+ < rb < 3r+/2. should the partition function
in fact be dominated by a classical solution, i.e.
should the action for this solution  and
therefore the free energy  be negative, then the equilibrium conguration will be globally
thermodynamically stable. however, this occurs only within the sub-range r+ < rb < 9r+/8.

following whiting [6], the preceding analysis may be written in a gauge invariant form by
instead varying the reduced action with respect to a generalised function (r+). this function
is chosen such that s/e |rb = , where the form of e is left undened. stationary points of
i then occur at  = b, and the second variation with respect to  at the stationary points
indicates local dynamic stability as before.

with the introduction of a negative cosmological constant , the characteristics of euclidean
solutions to the einstein equations are changed in a number of ways. the line element for these
solutions still takes the form (2.1), but the metric function becomes v (r) = 1  2m/r + r2/b2
where b2 = 3/. this is positive-denite only for values of r greater than the horizon radius

again, there is a coordinate singularity in the (, r) plane at r = r+, and the s2 at this point
may be included in the euclidean section if the period of  is now xed to be

.

(2.9)

in this case, however, the temperature measured at innity may no longer be identied with
the inverse of the periodicity as it can in asymptotically at spaces. there is no natural nor-
malisation of the killing vector / in the limit of large r due to the r2 term in the metric
function, and the locally measured temperature of any thermal state decreases to zero at inn-
ity. nonetheless, it is still consistent to regard 1/ as the constant of proportionality in the
tolman equation.

so, the elements of the canonical ensemble for hot anti-de sitter space may again be dened
b and wall temperature tb, but

as ideal isothermal cavities of invariant surface area ab = 4r2
should there be a black hole within the cavity, this quantity must satisfy

(2.10)

actually, it is convenient when considering anti-de sitter to transform to a dimensionless radial
coordinate , where

(2.11)

 def= 3 r/b.

6

remaining factors of the constant b may then be absorbed into the denition of each quantity,
although for clarity these are explicitly written. the wall temperature then becomes

btb =

(2.12)

which may be solved for + in terms of the constants b and btb. like the asymptotically
at case there will again exist either zero or two distinct black hole solutions, governed by the
relative values of b and btb, although the relation in this case is not so clear. the two solutions
are degenerate along the locus + = c0(b), dened implicitly through the real positive root of

accordingly, for a given cavity radius, the temperature at and above which solutions occur may
be written as

(btb)2 =

(2.14)

this behaviour is illustrated in gure 2, which is to be interpreted in the same way as the
previous diagram for the asymptotically at case. it should be noted that the diagrams are
identical in the limit b  1  i.e. close to the origin, since the cosmological constant can have
very little eect on the physics within cavities of radius rb  b. for larger cavities, however,
the dierences are manifest.

the heat capacity at constant surface area is

(2.15)

which is negative below the line + = c0(b) and positive above it. as before, then, the
equilibrium conguration of the larger black hole solution is always locally thermodynamically
stable, while that for the smaller solution is always unstable. if the limit is taken in which the
cavity radius becomes large while the horizon radii of the black hole solutions remain xed [8],
then btb  0 and

b2ca

(2.16)

clearly changing sign at + = 1.

the reduced action approach to black hole thermodynamics may easily be generalised to
the  6= 0 case. choosing, for example, a denition in which both the action and energy of hot
anti-de sitter space vanish, the energy function becomes

b1e =

b n(3

(2.17)

variation of the corresponding reduced action with respect to + yields stationary points if the
relation (2.12) is satised, and the second variation at these points again demonstrates local
dynamic stability of the classical solution if and only if ca > 0. the free energy is negative
only between + = b and + = f0(b), where f0 is dened implicitly as the solution curve
for + and b along which the free energy vanishes. within this range the partition function
will be dominated by the classical solution, and so the equilibrium conguration will be globally
thermodynamically stable. of course, whitings gauge invariant proof of the correspondence
between local dynamic and thermodynamic stability is immediately applicable since it relies
only on the general form of i, and not on the specic forms of e, b and (+) individually.

figure 3: the black hole solution curve in the (+, ) plane, in the limit of innite isothermal

cavity radius. the turning point max = 1/t0 occurs at + = 1  r+ = b/3.

as the limit (2.16) makes clear, an important dierence between this case and the previous
one lies in the asymptotic behaviour of the functions c0 and f0. as the cavity size increases,
these tend to 1 and 3 respectively, in contrast to their analogues in asymptotically at space
which both become innite. it is clear, therefore, that for an arbitrarily large cavity radius a
suciently low wall temperature may always be chosen such that both black hole solutions are
of nite size. when the cosmological constant is zero this is no longer the case since the turning
point of the solution curve, which lies along the line r+ = 2rb/3, occurs at an innite radius.
in the asymptotically at case, then, the large black hole solution is ill-dened as rb 
, and only the smaller solution remains. the at space canonical ensemble simply cannot
survive this limiting process. in the present case, however, with a suitable rescaling of the wall
temperature, a well-dened limit may be taken in which the elements of the canonical ensemble
are both isothermal and innite in extent, ostensibly because the functions c0 and f0 remain
nite. furthermore, all of the physical and thermodynamic characteristics of the solutions in
nite cavities are retained. this latter observation is essential in the forthcoming analysis.

since / possesses no natural normalisation at innity, a rescaling of the locally measured
temperature merely amounts to a rescaling of this killing vector. the temperature is, after all,
only a lagrange multiplier. with this in mind, if tb   tb where the factor  is dened as
(2.18)

v (r)1/2

 def= lim
r

then, in the b   limit, the xed temperature at innity may be identied with 1/.
the solution recovered through this process is formally identical to that which is analysed by
hawking and page [9].

in the transformed coordinate , the inverse temperature takes the form

b1  =

4
3

+/(2

+ + 1).

(2.19)

the features retained from the nite cavity case are immediately apparent: in contrast to the
innite asymptotically at case, a minimum temperature still remains below which there are no

8

black hole solutions. this temperature occurs in the case of the unique solution with horizon
size + = 1, where b1 max = 2/3. for temperatures greater than t0 = 1/max two distinct
black hole solutions exist, with horizon size larger and smaller than 1 respectively. as is manifest
from the limit (2.16), the heat capacity for the solutions with + > 1 is positive, while for those
with + < 1 it is negative.

again this may be related to the local dynamic stability using the reduced action which,

since e = m, takes the form

i =

the sign of the second variation is then clearly the same as the sign of the heat capacity for the

page [9].

3 nonconformal negative modes

it is evident from the previous section, then, that the correspondence between local thermo-
dynamic stability of an equilibrium conguration in the canonical ensemble and local dynamic
stability of the classical solutions is well established. this correspondence may be shown in a
gauge invariant way through variations of the reduced action for the ensemble with respect to a
generalised horizon radius, and is true for both asymptotically at and asymptotically anti-de
sitter space conned within a nite ideal isothermal cavity. in the latter case, however, both
the canonical ensemble and the above correspondence remain well dened, if suitably stated,
even in the limit of innite cavity radius.

nonetheless, it is desirable to have a more direct and intuitive indication of the dynamic
stability of the classical solutions in terms of a perturbation in the background geometry rather
than in a variation of the reduced action. the measure of stability in this approach is the
eigenvalue spectrum of the nonconformal perturbative modes for the solution. should there be
a mode with a negative eigenvalue, then the action for this solution is a saddle-point in its phase
space rather than a true minimum. consequently, there ought to be a correspondence between
the presence of such a negative mode and the local thermodynamic stability as governed by the
heat capacity. as will become clear in the forthcoming sections, it is the existence of a formal

9

limit in the anti-de sitter case that permits a well dened prescription for this problem, which
seems impossible in the asymptotically at case.

negative modes arise from the analysis of geometric uctuations about classical euclidean
solutions of the einstein eld equations. however, the analysis to conrm their existence must
be performed with care, since the gauge freedom of the euclidean action will in general introduce
a large number of non-physical negative modes associated with conformal deformations of the
metric. for pure gravity, the contributions from the conformal and the nonconformal modes
decouple if a suitable gauge is chosen. this procedure is now well understood.

in the path integral approach [13], the partition function z is generally dened as a functional
integral over all metrics with some xed asymptotic behaviour on some n-dimensional manifold
m,

this integral is formally dened by an analytic continuation to a euclidean section of m to
become

where the integral is performed over all positive denite metrics g. in the case of pure gravity,
the euclidean action i is

i = kzm

where k is a coupling constant and k is the second fundamental form on the boundary m.

the expansions are performed by writing the perturbed metric g as

with  treated as a quantum eld on the classical xed background g which vanishes on the
boundary m. proceeding in this fashion yields

i[g] = i[g] + i2[] +   

(3.6)

where the linear term i1 vanishes precisely because g is a classical solution, i2 is quadratic in
the eld , and    represents terms of higher than quadratic order. ignoring these additional
terms, and inserting the remainder into (3.2), gives the well-known expansion

log z =  i[g] + logzm

d[] e i2[].

(3.7)

the second term on the right is generally called the one-loop contribution to log z.

the quadratic contribution to the action is straightforward to evaluate, and may be written

for arbitrary  in the form

i2[] =

naively, then, the one-loop term may be written as 1
2 log det(2a) where  is a regularisation
mass, and the determinant is formally dened as the product of the eigenvalues of a. however,
due to the dieomorphism gauge freedom of the action, a will in general have a large number
of zero eigenvalues, and so this procedure as stated is ill-dened. the remedy is to add a gauge
xing term b  such that the operator a + b has no zero eigenvalues  and an associated ghost
contribution c, to obtain

log z =  i[g] 

1
2

log det(2{a + b}) + log det(2c).

(3.10)

such terms may be dealt with by means of generalised zeta functions, as considered by
gibbons, hawking, and perry [14], and extended to include a  term by hawking [13]. in order
that this be possible, the terms must be expressed as sums of operators, each with only a nite
number of negative eigenvalues. this may be achieved by writing a + b as f + g, where f
is a scalar operator acting on the trace of . the ghost term c is a spin-1 operator acting on
divergence-free vectors, and g is a physical gauge invariant spin-2 operator which acts on the
transverse and trace-free part of . for any dimension n  4, g takes the simple form

gabcd = gacgbdee  2racbd.

(3.11)

an observation of primary signicance is that, for   0, a gauge may be chosen in which
the operators f and c have no negative eigenvalues. if the background metric g is at then,
in addition, g will be positive-denite, but for a non-at background this is not the case. in
general, g will have some nite number  generally zero or one  of negative eigenvalues, which
correspond to the nonconformal negative modes of the solution. the eigenvalues of g are
determined by all solutions to the elliptic equation

gab

(n) = (n)  ab
(n)

(3.12)

where the eigenfunctions  are real, regular, symmetric, transverse, trace-free, and normalisable
tensors. clearly, should one of the eigenvalues of g be negative, then the product of all of
the eigenvalues would also be negative. the contribution to log z from uctuations about the
classical solution would then contain an imaginary component, leading to an instability in the
ensemble similar to the type proposed by gross, perry and yae [1].

4 general spherically symmetric solutions

following the treatment given in [1], and subsequently in [7], for the schwarzschild case, it is
clear that only spherically symmetric and  -independent solutions of (3.12) need be considered
as candidate nonconformal negative modes. in static and spherically symmetric backgrounds,
modes of higher multipole moment will necessarily have greater eigenvalues. with this assump-
tion, it is then straightforward to write down a construction for such solutions to g valid in any

11

n-dimensional euclidean black hole background of the form (2.1) for a general metric function
v (r). in the following expressions, a prime denotes d/dr.

since g acts only on symmetric transverse and trace-free tensors, then clearly the constructed
solutions must exhibit all of these properties. if the mode ab is written in the manifestly trace-
free and symmetric form

then the nal property, aab = 0, is guaranteed if it is further assumed that (r) and (r) are
related through the rst order equation

(r) =

rv   2v

(r) +

rv  + 2(n  1)v

rv   2v

(r).

(4.3)

with the ansatz (4.1) and (4.3), the eigenvalue equation (3.12) reduces to a linear second

order ordinary dierential equation for the component (r) which, for general v (r), is

v (r) +(cid:20)2r2[v v   v 2]  r(n  2)v v  + 2nv 2

r(rv   2v )

(cid:21) (r)

+(cid:20) r2v v  + r[2(n  1)v v   (n + 2)v 2] + 4v v 

r(rv   2v )

(cid:21) (r) = (r).

(4.4)

the problem of nding the eigenfunctions of g is therefore reduced, in the cases of interest, to
the problem of nding real and normalisable solutions to this equation that satisfy appropriate
boundary conditions.

for the backgrounds of interest, (4.4) may have as many as ve singular points, only three
of which are relevant. these are at the horizon radius r = r+, at r = rs  the real solution
to rv   2v = 0, and at r = . it is clear from (4.3) that at the rst of these, where v (r)
vanishes, the components (r) and (r) are equal and so the metric perturbation does not
alter the periodicity of  . furthermore, in order that ab be regular everywhere, the product
(rv   2v ) (r) must vanish at the second singular point, and hence

(rs)/(rs) = 

1

2rv hrv  + 2(n  1)vi(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)r=rs

the normalisation of the eigenfunctions may be dened as

.

(4.5)

n 2 = zm

dnx g ab ab,

(4.6)

so that acceptable solutions must be square-integrable functions in the sense that n 2 be nite,
although the extent of m will depend on the situation under consideration. (henceforth, any
reference to the solution will imply the normalised function n 1ab, unless n is explicitly
written.) in the innite cavity limit this requirement, and the condition of regularity at the
interior singular points, provide the necessary boundary conditions to solve for viable solutions.
for black holes conned within nite cavities however, this is no longer the case, since all
regular solutions to (4.4) will be normalisable. in such cases the canonical boundary conditions

12

for the ensemble must be imposed at the cavity wall, and it is this requirement which presents
diculties.

the perturbed metric gab + ab induces a line element

ds2 = v (r)h1 + (r)i d 2 +

1

v (r)h1 + (r)i dr2 + r2h1 + k(r)i d2,

(4.7)

and so the proper length around the s1 in the  direction at radius rb, which may be identied
with 1/tb, becomes

1/tb =  v (rb)1/2h1 + (rb)i1/2

.

(4.8)

for an isothermal cavity wall at r = rb the temperature must remain constant and so the
boundary condition, as used by allen [7], is

(r) |r=rb = 0.

(4.9)

however, this condition is insucient, since the elements of the canonical ensemble are dened
by both an invariant wall temperature and an invariant wall area ab. in the perturbed metric
the surface area of a space-like spherical shell at radius rb is no longer 4r2

b, but becomes

ab = 4r2

b h1 + k(rb)i.

(4.10)

as york points out [4], evaluating the eigenvalue spectrum with the boundary condition (4.9)
is not physically meaningful for the classical solutions since the wall area at constant radius is
not invariant. this explains the discrepancy between the cavity radius rb = 3r+/2 at which
the heat capacity of a schwarzschild black hole changes sign, and the critical radius at which
the negative mode vanishes in this case, calculated by allen to be rcrit  2.89 r+/2.
such that ab = ab, and then the condition

so, to apply the correct boundary condition, a modied cavity radius rb must be chosen

1 + (rb) = v (rb)/v (rb)

(4.11)

must be imposed. however, it is clear from (4.10) that, other than in the degenerate case
k(r) = (r) = (r)  0, this procedure is not particularly well dened since the parameter  is
freely variable. the areas ab and ab may therefore be matched at any nearby radius simply
by adjusting  appropriately. then for a given choice of  the modied cavity radius will be
uniquely dened, and the eigenvalue spectrum of (4.4) may be evaluated, but this spectrum will
in general be slightly dierent for each value of .

this problem disappears when the cavity is innite. if the solution ab is normalisable in
the sense discussed above, then the radial functions (r), (r) and k(r) must tend to zero at
some appropriate rate governed by the asymptotic form of (4.4). consequently, the isothermal
boundary condition at innity is automatically satised.

the original calculation of the negative mode eigenvalue for schwarzschild in n = 4 dimen-
sions, which is manifestly invariant of the magnitude of , nds m 2 neg  0.192.
in the
case of schwarzschild-anti-de sitter, a similar calculation will achieve two goals. it will conrm
the conjecture made by hawking and page regarding the existence of a nonconformal negative
mode and its vanishing point at the critical radius + = 1. it will also provide a well dened
demonstration of the correspondence between the local dynamic stability of a solution in terms
of its eigenvalue spectrum and the local thermodynamic stability of the equilibrium congura-
tion. this is only possible since, in contrast to the at case, the innite cavity solution in the
asymptotically anti-de sitter case retains all of the physical and thermodynamic characteristics
of the nite cavity solutions.

where a prime now denotes d/d, and  = b2.

the three real singular points of this equation are at  = +, 2, and . the remaining
two imaginary singular points are irrelevant in this analysis. around  = +, a trial solution

a similar expansion with coecients bn around  = 2 gives k = 0 and 3, both of which produce
regular solutions. however, only the k = 0 case contributes terms of order less than (  2)3,

using these coecients a numerical solution to (5.3) may be generated which is constrained to
within o(3) for   1 at the interior singular points. any simple algorithm is limited to this
accuracy by the existence of the k = 3 series about  = 2.
for a given choice of horizon size +, the aim of such a numerical method is to nd the
spectrum of eigenvalues (n), and in particular the minimum eigenvalue neg, for which regular
and normalisable solutions () exist. having xed +, then, a value for  is guessed, and
an appropriate numerical integrating routine [15] is used to integrate away from the horizon
using the coecients an as initial data. the solution is calculated to within a small step  of
2, and then analytically continued through the singular point to 2 +  using the bn. from
here, the solution is then calculated up to some large radius, at which point the criterion of

normalisability is assessed. for most choices of  the solution will fail, but for some choices 
specically the eigenvalues  it will not.

the conditions upon which normalisability is assessed may be obtained from the specic
form in this case of n 2 and the asymptotic behaviour of (5.3). with the benet of relations
(4.1) and (4.3), the relation (4.6) may be translated into an integral condition in one dimension
on (), so that

n 2 = 4 z 

+

d () 2().

(5.8)

the function () is well dened and nite at the interior singular points, and has asymptotic
behaviour  6 as   . this behaviour is, of course, the same as that for the weight function
derived from the self-adjoint form of (5.3). the solution ab will therefore be normalisable if
()  (7/2+x) for any positive x.
in the limit u  0 this equation becomes

the asymptotic form of (5.3) is readily obtained with the standard substitution   1/u.

u2 (u)  6u (u) + [10 + ] (u) = 0

(5.9)

where an over-dot denotes d/du  the solutions to which describe the asymptotic behaviour of
(). it should be noted that, in contrast with the asymptotically at case, the singular point
at  =  is now regular. in this limit,

()  a() 7/2+9/4 + b() 7/29/4.

(5.10)

two points are immediately apparent from the form of this solution. firstly, in accordance
with the naive expectation that the eigenfunction corresponding to the lowest eigenvalue is

15

the smoothest, the value of neg ought to be strictly less than 9/4. for eigenvalues greater
than this the exponent term acquires an imaginary component, and the solutions oscillate in
log. secondly, the criterion of normalisability is clearly equivalent to the single requirement
a()  0.
a simple numerical algorithm for nding neg is therefore to proceed as described above and,
for some xed + and a guessed , integrate () out to the second interior singular point at
2. then, transform the solution to a new function () = 7/2 () and integrate this out to
some large radius. as  increases the new function approaches

()  a() 9/4

(5.11)

since the second term must be very small. for some choice of , then, this remaining term will
be negative while for another it will be positive  the two choices bracketing the true value at
which a() vanishes. by subsequently rening the range over which  is guessed the minimum
eigenvalue can be found to reasonable accuracy. this algorithm is inelegant but nonetheless
quite eective. results for + in the range 0.1  4.0 are drawn in gure 4.
the graph clearly shows a single negative mode for n = 4 dimensions schwarzschild-anti-
de sitter vanishing at + = 1. this conrms the conjecture of hawking and page [9], and
demonstrates in a well dened manner the correspondence between this eigenvalue spectrum and
the local thermodynamic stability of the equilibrium conguration in the canonical ensemble.
as an aside, it should be noted that

urally in the limit where r+  b.

6 extending the spectrum to higher dimensions

the various quantities employed in the evaluation of the eigenvalue spectrum in n = 4 dimen-
sions schwarzschild-anti-de sitter are readily generalised to any higher dimension. the form of
the master equation (4.4) then makes it simple to verify that a nonconformal negative mode
will exist for a classical solution in any dimension n  4 only when the heat capacity of the
equilibrium conguration is negative.

in n dimensions, the metric function v (r) for schwarzschild-anti-de sitter becomes

v (r) = 1  2m/rn3 + r2/b2

(6.1)

where b2 = (n  1)(n  2)/2 and so, if the horizon is at r+ such that v (r+) = 0, the mass
may be expressed as

the periodicity then generalises to

mensions schwarzschild-anti-de sitter. the spectrum for n = 7 gives the upper curve (tending
to 5), and for n = 5 the lower curve (tending to 3).

the form of the heat capacity suggests the denition of a dimensionless radial coordinate  such
that

 def= (n  1)1/2 (n  3)1/2 r/b

(6.5)

which clearly reduces to (2.11) when n = 4. in any dimension then, there is an innite discon-
tinuity in ca at + = 1, with ca negative for + < 1 and positive for + > 1.

inserting into (4.4) any n, and with it the appropriate form of v (r) obtained from above,
yields a second order equation for () analogous to (5.3). two of the three relevant singular
points of this equation remain xed  at + and , while the third is dimension-specic. all
three remain regular, however, regardless of the dimension.
the weight function obtained from the self-adjoint form has asymptotic behaviour  n+2,

(6.6)

where

2 +  = (n  1)2/4.

(6.7)
the criterion of normalisability clearly remains the same  i.e. a()  0, and neg < (n 1)2/4.
the numerical results for neg obtained for the cases n = 5 and 7 for + in the range 0.1  4.0
are shown together in gure 5. the conjecture of hawking and page, and the correspondence
between this eigenvalue spectrum and local thermodynamic stability, may clearly be extended
to dimensions greater than four.

7 discussion and further applications

the discovery of a unique nonconformal negative mode for the n = 4 dimensions euclidean
schwarzschild solution led gross, perry and yae to propose the instability of at space at nite
temperature due to the barrier-tunnelling nucleation of black holes. the tunnelling process is
permitted because, in the semi-classical approach, an integration over quadratic uctuations of
the schwarzschild solution produces an imaginary component in the free energy of the system.
the existence of a negative mode is therefore a powerful indication of instability.

the subsequent observation that the euclidean schwarzschild solution becomes double-
valued when conned within a box, and that hot at space may therefore be stabilised against
black hole nucleation, enabled york to give a thermodynamically consistent interpretation of
the tunnelling process within a nite isothermal cavity. manifest within this approach is a
correspondence between local dynamic stability of the classical black hole solutions and local
thermodynamic stability of the equilibrium congurations in the canonical ensemble. this be-
comes a global thermodynamic stability if the action, and so the free energy, is negative. it
should also be the case, therefore, that this correspondence applies to negative modes: a noncon-
formal negative mode should exist only in those classical solutions for which the heat capacity
of the equilibrium conguration is negative. however, there appears to be no well dened way
of demonstrating this explicitly in nite isothermal cavities.

this problem may be overcome by instead considering hot anti-de sitter space. conned
again to a nite isothermal cavity, the euclidean schwarzschild anti-de sitter solution is also
double-valued, but in this case it remains so, if suitably stated, even in the innite cavity
limit. the result so obtained is formally identical to that analysed by hawking and page,
and retains all of the physical and thermodynamic characteristics of the nite cavity solutions.
this observation not only implies that the canonical ensemble in anti-de sitter is well dened,
but also presents an ideal opportunity in which to demonstrate the expected correspondence
between negative modes and heat capacity.

restricting the master equation (4.4) derived above to the case of n = 4 dimensions
schwarzschild-anti-de sitter, and solving for the eigenvalue neg of the smoothest normalis-
able eigenfunction, results in an eigenvalue spectrum for a range of classical solutions which
indeed has the same sign as the heat capacity function. this demonstrates the stated corre-
spondence in a manner invariant of the magnitude of the metric perturbation, and conrms the
conjecture of hawking and page that the negative mode passes through zero at the solution
with critical horizon radius r+ = b/3. for solutions with horizon radius greater than this, no
nonconformal negative mode exists. furthermore, the correspondence may be extended to any
spacetime dimension n > 4. this latter observation is of particular relevance to more recent
ideas involving anti-de sitter spaces.

analogous to that found by gross et al., a single nonconformal negative mode exists in
the n = 5 dimensions schwarzschild solution, which is described by witten [16] as leading
to semi-classical instability of the ground state m4  s1 in the original kaluza-klein theory
without fermions. in this case the periodically identied coordinate is not the imaginary time
but the compact fth spatial direction. in fact the tunnelling instability phenomenon, and the
associated negative mode, seems to be a quite general characteristic of any metric with periodic
identications  called a tachyonic solution [17]. the lorentzian continuation of the metric
may be interpreted as the result of the tunnelling instability, or alternatively as providing the
cauchy development of the time-symmetric initial data set on some plane of symmetry regarded
as t = 0.

with this in mind, the continuous one-parameter family of initial data discussed by horowitz

18

and myers [10], represented by the line element

ds2 = h1  m/r2 + r2/b2i d 2 +h1  m/r2 + r2/b2i1

dr2 + r2 d2,

(7.1)

may be considered as the restriction to the equatorial plane of the three-spheres in the n = 5
dimensional schwarzschild-anti-de sitter metric periodically identied in  . this metric satises
the constraint equation 4r = 12/b2, and the hyper-plane on which it is dened may be regarded
as t = 0. the radial coordinate is of course restricted to r > r+ where this is the real positive
root of the metric function as usual.
the euclidean section of the full n = 5 dimensions metric is obtained by setting t = iz,
and is now known to possess a single nonconformal negative mode if r+ < b/2. this mode
will pass through zero at equality, and hence solutions with r+ > b/2 will have no negative
modes. furthermore, if r+ is great enough, the action and hence the energy will be negative.
by analogy with the earlier argument for global thermodynamic stability, this strongly suggests
that, should the action be negative, then indeed it will be a global minimum for metrics with
these boundary conditions.

the idea, then, is that the larger schwarzschild-anti-de sitter black hole solution for a given
periodicity , should its action be negative, is in fact the global minimum of the action for
periodically identied metrics satisfying the scalar curvature constraint r = 2n/(n2). this is
clearly very similar to the proposal in [10] and it is believed that the above work provides strong
evidence in favour of this conjecture, albeit without recourse to the ads/cft correspondence.
it is a pleasure to acknowledge stephen hawking for suggesting this avenue of research, and
to thank malcolm perry and gary gibbons for their help and advice during the preparation of
this work.
