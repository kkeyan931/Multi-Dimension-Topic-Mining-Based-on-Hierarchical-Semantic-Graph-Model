(2.5) (2.6) diagram, spaces maps dened follows: a1 = i0a0; b1 = h(d0, b0), d0 = j0 k0 ( d2 0 = 0 k0 j0 = 0); a1 = i0a0, i1a1 = i1(i0a0) = i2 0a0; j1a1 =  (this map well dened: j0a0 cocycle, k0 j0 = 0, furthermore map depend representative choosen a0, i0a0 = 0, a0 = k0b0 b0 j1a1 =  = 0); k1 = k0b0 (k0b0 = i0a0 b0 d0b0 = j0(k0b0) = 0 implies k0b0 = i0a0, furthermore k0d0c0 = 0 k0 j0 = 0). let us also check explicitly exactness diagram: ker j1 given elements a1 = i0a0  = 0, i.e., j0a0 = 0c0. i1a1 given 0c0. follows ker j1 i1a1, j0k0b0 a0 k0b0 = i0c0, implying a1 = i2 elements a1 = i1c1 = i2 inverse inclusion follows j0 i0 = 0. ker k1 given elements  k0b0 = i0a0 = 0, i.e., b0 = j0c0, c0, im j1 given elements   = , i.e b0 = j0(e0 + k0f0). follows ker k1 = im j1. ker i1 given elements a1 = i0a0 i0(i0a0) = 0, i.e., i0a0 = k0b0 (which implies particular d0b0 = 0). im k1 given elements a1 = i0a0 = k0b0 b0 d0b0 = 0, spaces indeed same. 5 clearly, construction iterated taking starting exact couple derived couple. thus get sequence exact couples ir ar ar kr jr br.
