course, overwhelming property domain walls another reason interested nding new decay modes get rid them. turn short discussion gravitational eects domain walls, outlining new work may decay formation closed string loop boundary components. throughout paper use units h = c = g = 1. ii. vis domain walls: brief introduction solutions gravitational eld domain wall found vilenkin  (for open wall) ipser sikivie  (for closed walls). global structure vilenkin-ipser-sikivie (or vis) domain walls extensively discussed recently ( {$9602126$}, ) present brief sketch here. begin, look solution einstein equations source term energy momentum tensor describing distributional source located z = 0: = (x)diag(1, 1, 1, 0) (2.1) impossible nd static solution einstein equations source term; indeed, vis solution time-dependent solution describing uniformly accelerating domain wall. order understand global causal structure vis domain wall, useful use coordinates (t, x, y, z) metric takes form ds2 = e2k|z|(cid:16)dt2 dz2(cid:17) e2k(t|z|)(dy2 + dx2), (2.2) here, k = 2, wall located z = 0. gravitational eld solution amusing properties. example, take newtonian limit einstein equations (2.2) obtain equation newtonian gravitational potential energy density wall. equation clear wall positive surface energy density 2 = 2 3 repulsive gravitational eld, whereas wall negative energy density attractive gravitational eld. even simpler way see (positive ) vis wall repulsive notice z part metric rindler metric. isometric 2 + 1 dimensional de sitter space: information recovered noticing z= constant hypersurfaces ds2 = dt2 e2kt(dy2 + dx2). (2.3) given 2 + 1 de sitter topology s2 r follows domain wall world sheet topology. words, instant time domain wall topologically two-dimensional sphere. indeed, original ipser-sikivie paper coor- dinate transformation found takes (t, x, y, z) coordinates new coordinates (t, x, y, z) new coordinates metric becomes (on side domain wall): ds2 = dt 2 dx 2 dy 2 dz 2. (2.4) furthermore domain wall, old coordinates plane located z = 0, new coordinates hyperboloid x 2 + 2 + z 2 = 1 k2 + 2. (2.5) course, metric induced hyperboloid embedded minkowski spacetime de sitter metric, consistent already noted. metric provides us useful way constructing maximal extension domain wall spacetime: first, take two copies minkowski space, copy consider interior hyperboloid determined equation (2.5), match solid hyperboloids across respective boundaries; ridge curvature (much like edge lens) along matching surface, domain wall located. thus, inertial observer one side wall see domain wall sphere accelerates towards observer < 0, stops = 0 radius k1, accelerates away > 0. illustrate construction below, include acceleration horizons emphasize causal structure. 4 figures acceleration horizons (the future past cones). wall stops minimum distance 1/k. domain wall world- sheet surface two hyperboloids joined together. identify. worldline inertial observer (dark line) perceives domain wall uniformly accelerating spherical bubble. fig. 1. now, repulsive eect vacuum domain wall similar inationary eect positive cosmological constant seen de sitter space. indeed, often nd useful think vis spacetime inating universe vacuum energy concentrated sheet domain wall. iii. popping vis domain wall: instanton action a. euclidean section ingoing state construct instantons popping domain walls, useful rst recall basic facts euclidean section action ordinary vis domain wall. simplest scenarios, vis domain wall form breaking discrete symmetry. usually, one thinks symmetry breaking terms higgs eld . m0 denotes vacuum manifold (i.e., submanifold higgs eld conguration space higgs acquires vacuum expectation value minimize potential energy v ()), necessary condition domain wall exist 0(m0) 6= 0. words, vacuum domain walls arise whenever vacuum manifold connected. given assumptions, one usually writes lagrangian density matter eld 5 lm = 1 2 g v (). (3.1) exact form v () important. require order domain walls present v () discrete set degenerate minima, potential vanishes. given matter content, full (lorentzian) einstein-matter action reads: = z d4xg h r 16 + lmi + 1 8z d3xhk. (3.2) here, denotes four-volume system, denotes boundary region. one obtains euclidean action, i, euclidean section conguration analytically continuing metric elds reversing overall sign. simplied form euclidean action thin wall limit derived number recent papers ( {$9602126$}, ) reproduce full argument here. basically, one rst assumes cosmological constant vanishes (r = 0) one uses fact elds appearing matter eld lagrangian depend coordinate z normal wall, one integrates z-dependence obtain expression = n xi=1 2 z di d3xqhi. (3.3) here, di denotes i-th domain wall, energy density domain wall di, hi determinant three-dimensional metric hab (i) induced domain wall di n total number domain walls. hard prove variation relative hab (i) domain wall yield israel matching conditions. now, seen lorentzian section single vis domain wall two portions minkowski space glued together. therefore natural propose euclidean section obtained gluing two euclidean four-balls together along common s3 boundary component. way one obtains lens instanton, describes (in context no-boundary proposal) creation single vis domain wall nothing. lens instanton euclidean section incoming state - vis domain wall decay process (puncture) taken place. order calculate rate process, need construct instanton perforated domain wall. b. euclidean section outgoing state saw above, vis domain wall moving imaginary time sweeps s3 ridge curvature along equator lens instanton. similar way, expect virtual loop string moving imaginary time sweep two-sphere, s2. purposes, want string loop correspond puncture appears euclidean portion domain wall, expands maximum size, collapses again. words, euclidean section punctured domain wall obtained taking lens instanton, 6 truncating four-ball hole swept string made manifest. illustrated below: z x,y two-dimensional spheres correspond trajectory swept virtual loop string. boundaries hole, appears surface wall disappears again. (the string trajectory dark line.) identify. two identical flat four-balls, identify along respective boundaries. boundary ball three- sphere swept domain wall. four-ball radius 1/k. virtual string worldsheet located z = constant (c) < 1/k. put another way, instanton lens instanton subject constraint z = c < 1/k. fig. 2. explicitly, write metric space usual form ds2 = dt 2 + dx 2 + dy 2 + dz 2 = denotes imaginary time, domain wall (on lens instanton) located boundary ball radius r = 1/k. order obtain instanton punctured wall, truncate range variable z: c constant. words, shave portion lens instanton virtual string worldsheet located surface z = c. z c < r c. calculation action amplitude position calculate action decay rate process. since topology change situation, easy construct interpolating instanton nding slices initial instanton match smoothly slices nal instanton. may therefore use no-boundary ansatz without relying sophicticated arguments, 7 patching proposal put forward . described introduction, want calculate action dierence, s, euclidean action nal conguration (sf ) euclidean action initial conguration (si). since nal instanton obtained initial instanton simply removing cap boundary four-ball performing identications, follows action dierence come contribution. non-gravitating case described introduction, removed region contribute bulk term (corresponding hole domain wall) surface term (the boundary hole). volume removed cap calculated 22r3(cid:16)1 2 (c 2r q1 c 2/r2 + cos1(c/r) 2 )(cid:17) likewise, surface swept string two-sphere radius (r2 c 2)1/2. weighting bulk term domain wall energy density , surface term string tension therefore obtain = sf si = 4(r2 c 2) 2r3(cid:16)1 ignoring prefactor term, decay probability given (c 2r q1 c 2/r2 + 2 cos1(c/r) 2 )(cid:17) (3.4) p = es (3.5) (actually, prefactor term may contain interesting information situation, simple reason domain wall pops, overall symmetry spacetime broken spherical symmetry cylindrical symmetry; presumably, uctuations instanton would respect symmetry breaking. say evolution quantum elds punctured domain wall spacetime later paper). now, popping light domain walls , use thin wall approximation derive (3.4) justied scale symmetry breaking strings much larger scale symmetry breaking domain walls. follows that, generically, >> 1, hence p << 1. d. decay domain walls multiple punctures also possible several holes spontaneously form surface domain wall. simplest situation, string loop boundary components nucleate initial radius ((r2 c 2)1/2), string tension total action st ot = ns given (3.4), n total number holes. course, one might also imagine exotic scenarios holes nucleate dierent initial radii ri = 2)1/2, string tension i, total action decay would given (r2 ci 8 st ot = n xi=1 si si = 4(r2 ci 2)i 2r3(cid:16)1 2 (ci 2r q1 ci 2/r2 + cos1(ci/r) 2 )(cid:17) either situation, creation multiple holes heavily suppressed relative nucle- ation single hole. course, interest know whether domain wall ever completely annihilated processes discussing here. fact, hard prove domain wall completely destroyed decay process whenever least four string loop boundary components nucleated. order understand this, recall worldvolume domain wall isometric 2 + 1-dimensional de sitter spacetime (embedded 3 + 1-dimensional minkowski), trajectory given string loop boundary component may obtained taking intersection hyperboloid surface constant z (relative coordinates (2.4) minkowski space), simply copy 2+1 dimensional minkowski spacetime. view hyperboloid, see domain wall two- sphere expands uniformly outwards, string loop boundary components intersections two-sphere timelike hypersurfaces. least four (non-parallel) hypersurfaces, spacelike surface hypersurfaces bound tetradedron xed size. three dimensions, tetrahedron may bound two-sphere, initially least domain wall may still lie (partially) within tetrahedron. however, sphere continues expand always eventually envelop tetrahedron, hence domain wall annihilated (i.e., string boundary components collide precisely corners tetrahedron). three (or fewer) timelike hypersurfaces, could never completely bound two-sphere way. intersection sphere given timelike hypersurface would continue unbounded direction (because would never encounter another timelike hypersurface). thus, least portion domain wall would survive eternally. words, need nucleate least four punture wounds domain wall order completely annihilate domain wall. iv. lorentzian evolution punctured domain walls last section, showed vis domain wall may decay via formation closed string loop boundary components worldvolume wall. found instantons, calculated corresponding actions rates, processes. turn attention lorentzian, real time, picture process. first, recall representation (fig. 1) vis domain wall two solid hyperboloids minkowski space, identied along respective boundaries. constraint coordinated z, z c < r, imposed euclidean section, extends lorentzian section well. thus, lorentzian coordinates (t, x, y, z), equation motion loop string may written 9 x 2 + 2 = (r2 c 2) + 2 (4.1) thus, initial radius loop string (at = 0) seen r2 c 2 > 0, expect given lorentzian section must match smoothly euclidean section. late times, hole expanding speed light. course, hole never completely devours wall simple reason spherical wall also expands exponentially. global structure spacetime illustrated below: string boundary components (dark lines) bound hole domain wall. hole expands exponentially, devouring wall rate wall expands. nucleation surface, puncture first appears. identify. global structure punctured domain wall (the shaded portion wall removed). figure 3 fig. 3. interesting consider gross properties particles propagating background wall spontaneously decays way. example, suppose consider scalar eld couples higgs eld (of domain wall) interaction lint = 2 22 (here, thinking higgs eld standard 4, double-well potential).  shown reection coecient scattering particles domain wall zero limit domain wall zero thickness. words, makes sense think (innitely thin) vis domain walls considering paper spherical, accelerating, moving mirrors. put another way, side domain wall spherical cavity, dirichlet boundary conditions elds boundary cavity. 10  shown mirror moving uniform acceleration generate (relative inertial particle detector) thermal bath radiation temperature = 2kb kb boltzmanns constant. course, could predicted vis spacetime would entropy temperature form, simply repulsive energy wall generates cosmological horizon leads loss information. inertial observers vis spacetime never recover information happening side domain wall, represent ignorance tracing states associated horizon. domain wall decays formation closed string loop boundary component worldvolume wall, isotropic thermal nature initial (vis) spacetime lost. initial spherical symmetry broken cylindrical symmetry hole forms. hole sense window two spherical cavities, information propagate. would interesting explicit calculation scattering -particles background vis domain wall single puncture. shown, four (or more) punctures spontaneously nucleate wall, string boundary components must eventually collide annihilate wall, energy density initially stored wall thermalized. nal annihilation domain wall process rather analagous endpoint ination, sense source driving exponential expansion suddenly switched o. however, domain wall several punctures presumably generate highly non-isotropic radiation background, contrast inationary scenario. v. conclusions: potential brane-world instability? shown describe decay vacuum domain walls formation closed string boundary components, eects gravity included. found new instantons, well corresponding lorentzian solutions, describe formation evolution multiple closed string loop boundary components given vis domain wall background. would nice complete picture quantum elds evolve background one punctured walls. general domain walls arise (d-2)-dimensional defects (or extended objects) d- dimensional spacetimes. fact, domain walls common feature menagerie objects appear low-energy limit string theory, discussed detail {$9608173$} {$9604090$}. course, recently enormous amount interest possibility universe might domain wall moving ve-dimensional bulk spacetime. particular, randall sundrum {$9711099$} recently put forward model universe z2-symmetric positive tension domain wall bounding two bulk regions anti- de sitter (ads) spacetime. original scenario, bulk cosmological constant ne- tuned relative domain wall energy density eective cosmological constant brane precisely zero. however, period ination brane-world 11 eective cosmological constant would positive, domain wall would simply four-dimensional de sitter hyperboloid embedded ve-dimensional ads (for recent interesting discussion various semiclassical instabilities associated de sitter brane-worlds see {$9912118$}). thus, causal structure de sitter brane-worlds identical vis domain wall 1. now, one certainly imagine domain wall randall-sundrum model arises symmetry breaking pattern allows universe end two-brane (all required associated exact sequence form (1.1)). scenario, brane-world would unstable formation holes - two-dimensional surfaces universe would end. holes would accelerate out, devouring universe converting brane-world elds bulk degrees freedom. since fundamental polytope four dimensions faces, follows would nucleate least holes completely annihilate de sitter universe fashion. one could even go imagine scenarios brane-world boundary puncture wound four-brane (in way could one large extra dimension). general, would expect many (self-gravitating) p-branes supergravity mod- els unstable sort decay processes described paper. point view, process studied another example sort brane damage
