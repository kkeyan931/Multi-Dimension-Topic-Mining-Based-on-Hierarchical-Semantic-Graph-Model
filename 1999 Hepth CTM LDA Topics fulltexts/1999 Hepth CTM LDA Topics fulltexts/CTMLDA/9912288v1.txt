i. introduction

recently noncommutative geometry has attracted much interest in studying on string

and m-theory in the b-eld [17]. for simplicity, we consider supergravity solutions which

are related to d3-branes with ns b eld. according to the ads/cft correspondence [8],

the near horizon geometry of d=7 black hole solution can describe the large n limit of

noncommutative super yang-mills theory (ncsym). we take a decoupling limit to isolate

the near horizon geometry from the remaining one. it turns out that the noncommutativ-

ity aects the ultra violet(uv) regime, leaving the infra red(ir) regime of the yang-mills

dynamics unchanged. the ncsym is thus not useful for studying the theory at short dis-

tances. it is well known that an ncsym with the noncommutativity scale  on a torus

of size  is equivalent to an ordinary supersymmetric yang-mills theory (osym) with a

magnetic ux provided that  = 2/2 is a rational number [9]. the equivalence between

the ncsym and the osym can be understood from the t-duality of the corresponding

string theory. hence the osym with b-eld is the proper description in the uv region,

while the ncsym takes over in the ir region. actually, the noncommutativity comes from

the b   limit of the ordinary theories [5,6,10].

we remind the reader that, aside the entropy, there exists an important dynamical quan-

tity, the greybody factor(absorption cross section) for the quantum black hole [1215]. on

the string side, there was a calculation for the absorption of scalars into the noncommutative

d3-branes [16]. however, the authors have not considered the rr sectors in ref. [16].

myung, kang, and lee [17]have studied the quantum aspect of the d3-brane black

hole in b-eld background using a minimally coupled scalar. such minimally coupled eld

might describe uctuations of the o-diagonal gravitons polarized parallel to the brane

(hab, a, b = 0, 1, 2, 3). they derived the exact form of the absorption cross section(l) in

b-eld on the supergravity side. it is well known that the cross section can be extracted

from the solution to the linearized equation after the diagonalization. hence it does not

need to take the decoupling limit. it turns out that b6=0

l

> b=0

l

. this implies that the

2

presence of the b-eld suppresses the curvature eect surrounding the d=7 black hole.

recently, kaya [18] has calculated the absorption cross section for the rr scalar in the

d3-brane with b-eld [18]. he claims that the greybody factor does not change even if

the b-eld is large. however, we point out that such a calculation is incomplete as will

be shown below. he missed the important case of b  , and considered the rr scalar
eld equation only so that the constraint imposed by other eld equations was neglected.

furthermore, his analysis was done without the waves propagating along the world volume

directions.

in this paper we study the propagations of the rr scalar() and the dilaton() by d3-

branes with b-eld. here we use all information contained in the equations of motion, the

bianchi identities, and the gauge condition for graviton.

in the absence of b-eld, such

elds as well as gravitons polarized parallel to the d3-brane belong to minimally coupled

scalars as well known. however, in the presence of b-eld, these scalars are coupled to the

background nonminimally.

in this sense, we may regard such elds as the xed scalars.

actually, in the case of b  , the dilaton(rr scalar) turns out to be (non)propagating
modes. it is very important to test whether or not there is a change in the absorption cross

sections of the dilaton between the commutative and the noncommutative cases.

the organization of this paper is as follows. in sec.ii, we briey review the eld equations

relevant for our study. sec.iii is devoted to analyzing the perturbations. the propagation

of the rr scalar is investigated in sec.iv. this induces an instability of the near-horizon

geometry in the black d-string background. sec.v deals with the propagation of the dilaton

with the dilaton gauge. in sec.vi, we study the propagation of the dilaton with the harmonic

gauge and obtain its absorption cross section. finally, we discuss our results in sec.vii.

ii. formalism

we start with the low energy limit of type iib superstring action in the einstein

frame(gm n = e/2gm n ) [12]

with the self-duality constraint f5 = f5 at the level of the equations of motion. the relevant

equations of motion lead to [19]

from now on we work in the string frame and thus neglect the subscript s. here the

asymptotic value of b-eld is b23 = tan  and the parameter r is dened by cos r4

0(= 4gn2). n is the number of the d3-branes and g = g is the string coupling
constant.
it is obvious that for  = 0(h = 1) one recovers the ordinary d3-brane black
hole with the standard ads5s5 geometry in the near horizon.
background( ) is constant. for  = /2(h = f ), however, one nds the d3-brane black

in this case the dilaton

hole in the very large b-eld and thus the eect of noncommutativity appears. here one
nds a deviation from ads5s5 in the near horizon. this actually corresponds to the black
d-string background given only by  and f3.

iii. perturbations

now let us introduce the perturbations to derive the greybody factor as [20]

gm n = gm n + hm n

 = 0 + ,

 =  + ,

f01r = f01r + f01r = f01r(1 + f3),

hr23 = hr23 + hr23 = hr23(1 + h3),

f0123r = f0123r + f0123r = f0123r(1 + f5)

(15)

(18)

with all other perturbations to be zero. for the perturbations above, we keep the background

symmetry up to the linearized level. general uctuations give a complicated system of

dierential equations:

gp q(m hn q +n hm qqhm n ). here we have a relation of gm n p

m n =

t . furthermore we nd from three bianchi

f3, f5  propagating modes,

h3  nonpropagating mode.

this means that the ns b-eld gives us just the noncommutative eect but it does not

belong to the physically propagating eld. for the graviton modes, we may use either the

dilaton gauge [21]

or the harmonic gauge [22]

m hm p = hm n p

m n

m hm p = 0.

(26)

(27)

although such choice of gauge condition does not eliminate all of the gauge freedom, it

simplies the perturbation equations. we note here that, although the equation (21) is a

6

decoupled one for the rr scalar(), eqs. (23) and (24) contain information for . kaya

considered eq.(21) only [18]. as can be seen the dilaton equation takes a very complicate

form coupled with various other elds. to decouple  from the remaining elds, we have

to do some further work. hence we separate the rr scalar from the dilaton. let us rst

investigate the rr scalar.

iv. rr scalar propagation

now let us consider the spacetime dependence

(t, x1, x2, x3, r, i) = eitei(k1x1+k2x2+k3x3)yl(1, 2,   , 5)l(r)

(28)

with 2
iyl(i) = l(l + 4)yl(i). yl(i) denotes spherical harmonics on s5 with unit radius.
here l(r) is the radial part of the l-partial wave of energy . to get the noncommutative

eect, it is very important to assume the coordinate dependence along the world volume

directions. then eq. (21) takes the form

if  = 0(b-eld is turned o) and l = 0, one nds that eq.(29) reduces to the s-wave

minimally coupled scalar() equation in the d=7 black hole background [12]

from (31) simply by substituting r0 with r [17]

potential well(dashed line) and for  = 0, one nds a potential barrier(solid line). the horizon is

located at r = 0.

for an arbitrary (b), it is very dicult to solve eq.(34). thus, let us discuss two interesting
cases. if   
4 , h  1. in this case, the last term of eq.(34) can be neglected, compared
with other terms. then the rr scalar cross section takes the same form as that of the
minimally coupled scalar in eq. (33). for   
an important role in the near-horizon. in the near horizon, one nds that v n h

4 , h  f . in this case, the last term plays
=0 = 15/4r2
= 1/4r2 for  = /2. the latter case induces an instability of the
near-horizon geometry in the black d-string background because the potential well allows

for  = 0 and v n h

us the scattering state( =real) as well as the bound state( = i). as shown in fig.1, the

9

singular behaviors of v=0, 

2 seem to appear as r  0. however, this is a coordinate artifact.
using the coordinate z in sec.vi instead of r, one cannot nd such singular behaviors in the

near horizon.

v. dilaton propagation with the dilaton gauge

in this section, we wish to study the propagation of the dilaton with the dilaton gauge in

(26). under this gauge the dilaton equation takes a rather simpler form than the harmonic

gauge [21]. assuming

(t, x1, x2, x3, r, i) = eitei(k1x1+k2x2+k3x3)yl(1, 2,   , 5)l(r),

(39)

the dilaton equation (22) leads to

our strategy is to disentangle the last three terms. for this purpose we have to use the

dilaton gauge condition (26) and the linearized equations for h3, f3, f5 in eqs. (23)-(25).

because this is a nontrivial task, we only consider a simpler and physically interesting
case of   
string background.

in this case we nd hm n p = fm n p qr = 0, which implies also that

h3 = f5 = 0. furthermore, eq.(23) with this gives us a constraint

(m )e  f m p q = 0.

(41)

since e  f m p q 6= 0, eq.(41) implies  = constant. this implies that  is a non-propagating
mode in the black d-string background. hence the instability problem of the rr scalar with

if the last term is absent, eq.(46) reduces to the rr scalar equation (34) with  = 

2 . it is

easily proved that, considering (16) and (17) only, one nds that the dilaton equation (22)

leads to eq.(34). hence the presence of the last term is important to distinguish the dilaton

from the rr scalar. without b-eld, the xed scalar  is given by [14]

polarized parallel in the world volume plays a role of the xed scalar. with b-eld, we may

assume a relation between the dilaton and ha

equation with the dilaton gauge, one cannot determine the relation between  and h2

this is so beacuse we have no further information for h2

the last term in (53) with the dilaton gauge gives rise to a dicult relation for hm n to solve

eq. (50). hence wed better use the harmonic gauge condition.

the two equations (56) and (57) should be the same one. here we assume h2

3 = a.

then one nds a relation

4  12a = 4a,

which gives us a = 1/2. hence one obtains the correct dilaton equation as

for the leading-order calculation. finally, it remains to nd an approximate solution to

eq.(60) for low energies (  0) and derive the absorption cross section. we devide the
space into three regions(i, ii, iii) and then match solutions in them together. in the near

horizon region(i) the equation takes the form

which is nothing but the standard bessel equation for

i(z) = h6(z). the above equation
can be interpreted as the schrodinger-like equation with the energy e = 1 which is valid for

large z(in the near horizon of r  0). the solution is given by

i(z) = z2h6(z).

in the intermediate zone(ii), the -term can be ignored. thus one nds the solution

vii. discussions

r = hi

1  h2

i = 0, the dilaton , f3, and h2

2 = /2 are physically propagating modes whereas the rr scalar , h3, and f5,

first we discuss the propagations of elds in the black d-string background of b  
3 =

limit. we have shown that, assuming h = hr
h1
are non-propagating modes. interestingly, it turns out that the absorption cross section of
the dilaton in the b   limit is the simple replacement of r0  r 
2 and 8  8.9 in the

0|b=0 in (31) up to overal numerical constant as can be seen in (70). the rr scalar with
 = 
2 has a negative potential as shown in fig.1. kaya missed this case [18]. this induces

2 + h3

an instability of the near horizon in the black d-string background. fortunately, however,

h3-equation (23) requires that this mode should not be a propagating one.

for a general analysis, let us consider the following equation with the parameter s upon

the diagonalization:

s = 0.

hence we nd that the new scalars appeared in the b   limit may take a value of
4  s  32. especially, the rr scalar with s = 4 is not allowed for matching procedure
and thus it cannot be a propagating mode. and the dilaton has s = 2 and its absorption

cross section is given by (70). for s = 0 case(minimally coupled scalar), one can recover

(33) with  = 

2 from (72).

in conclusion, in the b   limit, the noncommutative eect is turned on. in this case,
we nd that the rr scalar is not a propagating mode, but the dilaton plays a role of the

xed scalar. its absorption cross section takes a dierent form from that of the minimally

coupled scalar. analysis for an arbitrary (b) remains unexplored.
