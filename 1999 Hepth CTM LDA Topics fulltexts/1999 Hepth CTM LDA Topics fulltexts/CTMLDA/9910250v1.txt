abstract

four-dimensional n = 1 supersymmetric gauge theories with two adjoints
and a quartic superpotential are believed, from ads/cft duality, to have
sl(2, z) invariance.
in this note we review an old, unpublished argument
for this property, based solely on eld theory. the technique involves a com-
plexied avor rotation which deforms an n = 2 supersymmetric gauge the-
ory with matter to an n = 1 theory, leaving all holomorphic invariants un-
changed. we apply this to the n = 1 gauge theory with two massless adjoints
and show that it has the same auxiliary torus as that of n = 4 gauge theory,
from which sl(2, z) invariance follows. in an appendix, we check that our
arguments are consistent with earlier work on the su (2) case. our technique
is general and applies to many other n = 1 theories.

recently, the theory of four-dimensional n = 1 supersymmetric gauge theory with
two chiral superelds in the adjoint representation has received considerable attention. in
particular, its sl(2, z) electromagnetic self-duality and its ads5 dual representation have
been discussed in numerous papers [1]. for large gauge groups, sl(2, z) invariance for this
theory has been strongly suggested using its conjectured duality with type iib supergravity,
which has a semiclassical symmetry of this type. since iib string theory has sl(2, z) as
well, then, if one accepts the ads duality for arbitrary gauge and t hooft couplings, the
sl(2, z) duality of the eld theory should extend to any gauge group.

the sl(2, z) duality has never been established in the literature from purely eld theo-
retic considerations. however, there is an unpublished argument in favor of this symmetry,
and in view of recent interest in this theory, it seems appropriate to make it more widely
known. specically, we want to consider, for any gauge group g, the n = 1 supersym-
metric gauge theory with two chiral superelds 1, 2 in the adjoint representation and a
superpotential

w = h tr[1, 2][1, 2] .

(1)

the theory is non-renormalizable and must be dened with a cuto. however we are in-
terested in its infrared behavior, where it ows to a conformal eld theory. the coupling
h, although canonically of inverse mass dimension, becomes dimensionless in the infrared.
dene h to be its value in the infrared, in some suitable scheme. in [2] it was shown that
there is a continuous set of conformal eld theories near h = 0. in other words, the quartic
superpotential above is an exactly marginal perturbation of the interacting conformal eld
theory with zero superpotential. the marginal coupling h is inherited from the marginal
gauge coupling  of n = 4 supersymmetric yang-mills theory, and in [2] it was conjectured
that the sl(2, z) self-duality that acts on  is also inherited by the theory with two adjoints.
in this paper we claim the following. first, we verify that there exists a space of conformal
eld theories which we label by the parameter , or equivalently q = e2i, of which h is
a nontrivial and presumably scheme-dependent function. second, we claim that the set
of theories parameterized by q, or equivalently h(), has sl(2, z) duality; the conformal
theory with parameter , and the theories with parameter (a+b)/(c+d), a, b, c, d integers,
ad  bc = 1, are actually dierent descriptions of the same theory. in particular, as seen
in the case of su(2) studied in [3], the theory with h = 0 is equivalent to a theory with a
particular non-zero value of h.

to prove this we employ a complexied avor symmetry transformation, under which
all holomorphic quantities are invariant even though the theory as a whole is altered. one
subtlety, not resolved here, is how precisely to match the dimensionless coupling  of the
n = 4 theory on to the coupling h() of the two-adjoint theory. this issue need not be
settled for the sl(2, z) invariance to be established.
let us begin by reviewing the arguments of [2] concerning the theory with two adjoints.
consider an n = 1 supersymmetric eld theory in four dimensions, with a gauge group
g and nf chiral multiplets i, i = 1, . . . , nf in the adjoint of g. if nf = 0 the theory is
n = 1 yang-mills and shows connement and chiral symmetry breaking. if nf = 1 and the
superpotential is zero, the theory is n = 2 supersymmetric and has a coulomb branch with
special points where magnetically charged bps states become massless [4]. if nf = 3 and
the superpotential vanishes then the theory is infrared free. however, with a renormalizable

2

superpotential

ytr[1, 2]3

the theory will ow to a non-trivial xed point, becoming n = 4 supersymmetric in the far
infrared. if y = 2, then the theory is strictly n = 4 supersymmetric and is conformal at
all scales. there is a one-complex-dimensional space of such theories, indexed by the gauge
coupling and theta angle through the exactly marginal parameter  = /2 + 4i/g2.

for nf = 2, a simple argument shows that with the non-renormalizable superpotential

w = htr[1, 2][1, 2]

the theory is expected to ow to a point on a one-complex-dimensional space of conformal
xed points. specically, the requirement that the beta functions for h and for the gauge
coupling g both vanish reduces to a single condition on the two couplings [2]. to see this,
note that the anomalous mass dimensions of 1 and 2 are equal by symmetry, so the beta
functions take the form

g = f (g)[c2(g) + 2c2(g)] ; h = h[1 + 2] ,

(2)

where these formulas are exact as a consequence of n = 1 non-renormalization theorems.
(here c2(g) is the second casimir of the adjoint representation.) only one condition, namely
(g, h) = 1/2, is required for the two beta functions to vanish; therefore, if there are any
solutions to this condition, they will typically form one-complex-dimensional subspaces in
the two-complex-dimensional space of couplings.1

unfortunately, the condition (g, h) = 1/2 can only be satised well outside the realm
of perturbation theory, and it cannot be proven without a shadow of a doubt that solutions
exist. however, there are strong reasons to believe that they are present. (recent large-n
results [1] support this point of view, of course.) we will assume for the remainder of this
paper that there is a unique and connected space of solutions to this equation, and that this
space contains a single point with h = 0 and g equal to some special value g.

we will now focus our attention on the space of conformal theories with (g, h) = 1/2.
this one-complex-dimensional space has a single marginal coupling as its parameter. these
theories are particularly interesting as they can be reached through a simple deformation
of n = 4 yang-mills. in particular, consider n = 4 yang-mills, with gauge coupling  ,
deformed by a mass term.

1if g has a three-index symmetric invariant, we may consider for nf = 3 the superpotential
ytr[1, 2]3 + ys
ijktr{i, j}k. if ys 6= 0, the theory may still be conformal [5] but has only n = 1
supersymmetry; the space of conformal theories is three-complex-dimensional (including the n = 4
subspace.) similarly one may add h2tr{1, 2}{1, 2}+h3[tr{1, 1}{1, 1}+tr{2, 2}{2, 2}]
to the superpotential of the theory with nf = 2. since the new  functions h2 = h2[1+2]; h3 =
h3[1 + 2] are proportional to the other two, the vanishing of all four beta functions gives only one
condition on four couplings, (g, h, h2, h3) = 1/2, so again we nd a three-complex-dimensional
space of xed points. more details are found in [2].

(in the following we will be careful to distinguish  , the coupling of the high-energy n = 4
theory, from both the running gauge coupling g and the exactly marginal parameter of the
low-energy conformal theories, which we will call .) at scales below m3 (more precisely,
below some physical scale related nontrivially to the holomorphic parameter m3) we may
integrate out 3. the theory becomes

w = 

1
m3

tr[1, 2][1, 2] .

at the cross-over scale m3 the theory is usefully parameterized by the gauge coupling g =

1/im  and h  1/m3. at low energy it ows to a xed point with couplings g( ) and
h( ); the initial gauge coupling of the n = 4 theory species which n = 1 conformal eld
theory will be reached in the infrared. note that for   i, h  0 but g is nite.
there is a subtlety involved in matching the theory above the scale m3 with that below
m3. the symmetries of the theory permit non-perturbative corrections to the superpotential,
making it of the form

w = hef f tr[1, 2][1, 2] ,

(3)

where

hef f = f (q)/m3, f (q) = 1 + o(q) .

the behavior of f (q) for small q (large im  ), the weak coupling region, is determined by
perturbation theory. the only direct constraint on f is that it be single-valued under shifts of
the theta angle by 2, that is q  e2iq. higher order corrections to f (q) are associated with
instantons, and have not been determined beyond low orders. a similar ambiguity arises if
we attempt to exchange the two parameters (, m3) for (hef f , ), where  is the holomorphic
dynamical scale of the low-energy asymptotically-free gauge theory. by symmetry,

c2(g)  mc2(g)

3

g(q), g(q) = q + o(q2) .

(4)

again, only the leading behavior of g(q) at weak coupling is determined, and consequently
we will not use  in most of our discussion. these ambiguities will not aect our general
arguments.

the n = 4 theory has a duality symmetry, namely an sl(2, z) symmetry generated
by the semiclassical symmetry    + 1 and the strong-weak coupling transformation
  1/ . this means the space of n = 4 theories is smaller than it appears due to
discrete identications. since it seems that there is a one-to-one map between the space of
n = 4 theories and the infrared two-adjoint conformal eld theories, it is natural to guess
[2] that the space of two-adjoint conformal theories is also reduced by the same discrete
identications, taking the form of sl(2, z) transformations on the low-energy marginal
coupling constant . we will call this the inherited duality conjecture.

we now prove this conjecture, using the following trick. first, consider the n = 4 theory

with two mass deformations.

if m2 = m3 = m the theory is n = 2 supersymmetric; it is the theory of n = 2 yang-
mills with a massive adjoint hypermultiplet, rst studied in [6,7]. the moduli space is a

4

coulomb branch with an auxiliary seiberg-witten torus and seiberg-witten form, as in
[4]; the torus can be used to specify the low-energy gauge couplings, and together with the
form gives the low-energy kahler potential (the eective lagrangian up to second order in
momentum.) the torus is a function of the holomorphic quantities m2 = m2m3 and q, and
of the holomorphic coordinates on the moduli space; the low-energy gauge coupling is also
a holomorphic function of these quantities. for m = 0 the theory is n = 4 supersymmetric
and the auxiliary torus is invariant under sl(2, z), as expected; for m 6= 0 the torus is
sl(2, z) covariant, although it can be written in an sl(2, z) invariant form with a suitable
choice of coordinates on the moduli space [6,7].

now consider the global symmetries of this model. for m = 0 there is an so(6) r-
symmetry containing an su(3) avor symmetry under which i are triplets. let us consider
its su(2) subgroup which acts on 2, 3 only. mass terms mijij, i, j = 2, 3 break the
symmetry; mij transforms in the 3 of su(2). the n = 2 case just discussed requires
mij = m(3)ij, where a are the pauli matrices. a transformation

2  ei2 , 3  ei3 ,

where  is real, is an su(2) avor-symmetry transformation which changes the phases of
m2, m3 but leaves the theory invariant.

the observation which permits a proof of the inheritance conjecture involves the fact
that holomorphic quantities, such as the low-energy gauge coupling, can only depend on the
holomorphic product det m = m2m3. nothing holomorphic depends on m2/m3. consider
the behavior of the theory under the transformation

2  e2 , 3  e3 ,

(5)

where again  is real. this imaginary su(2) transformation is not a symmetry. n = 2
supersymmetry is broken to n = 1, and the kahler potential, which no longer need depend
only on holomorphic quantities, is altered. however, although the theory as a whole is not
invariant under this transformation, all holomorphic quantities are unchanged. in particular,
det m is invariant under this transformation, and so the torus, and the low-energy gauge
couplings, are unaected. it follows, therefore, that for det m non-zero the low-energy theory

inherits the torus of the n = 2 theory with m2 = m3 =  det m.
to obtain the theory with two massless adjoints and a quartic superpotential, we take
m3 6= 0 but m2m3 = 0. the torus of this theory is the same as for m2 = m3 = 0, the n = 4
case; it is invariant under sl(2, z). at all points on the moduli space where the low-energy
gauge group is abelian, all infrared gauge couplings l are equal to the ultraviolet coupling
 . at the origin of moduli space, the torus has no massive parameters, indicating a set of
conformal theories indexed by  , with discrete identications under sl(2, z). this indicates
a one-to-one map between the marginal parameter  and the ultraviolet coupling  , so we
may take  =  . thus, the set of conformal eld theories with group g and two adjoint
chiral multiplets inherits sl(2, z) duality from its n = 4 parent.
3 does not
change the low-energy torus and its attendant gauge couplings. however, there is a simple
physical explanation, most easily presented in the case of g = su(2). the n = 2 theory
with a massive adjoint hypermultiplet, with superpotential

it may seem strange at rst that the deformation by a mass term 1

has a moduli space with coordinate u = 1
1). for given hui, the low-energy gauge cou-
pling l is the modular parameter of a holomorphic torus [6], reproduced in eq. (10), which
is a function of m2, u, and  . now perform an imaginary global symmetry transformation
as in eq. (5), giving

where m2m3 = det m =  m2. the operator u may still have a vacuum expectation value, in
which case the low-energy physics is again a u(1) gauge theory, whose gauge coupling is the
modular parameter of a holomorphic curve [8]. since the complexied avor rotation eq. (5)
leaves det m, u and  invariant, this curve is the same as that of the n = 2 theory eq. (6),
with m2 replaced with m2m3 in eq. (10). thus, the gauge kinetic function remains the
same as it was in the n = 2 theory.
mathematically, as discussed earlier, this is a consequence of the absence of a holomorphic
invariant which measures m2/m3. but how can it make physical sense that the low-energy
u(1) coupling l should not depend in any way on m2/m3? this is quite easy to see in the
weak-coupling limit. let us take the expectation value of u to be large compared with m2
and m3, so that perturbation theory is valid. the su(2) group is broken to u(1) at the
scale u; the elds 2, 3 are massive charged elds, with mass matrix

2u

2u m3 # .
" m2

(8)

referring to their masses as 2 and 3, we note 23 = 4u + m2m3. consider the case where

|3| > |2u| > |2|. (all other cases lead to the same result, though the description of the
physics will be dierent.) above both masses, the coupling does not run. between 3 and
2u, the su(2) theory has only two adjoints and runs toward strong coupling, generating
a logarithm of 3/2u with beta-function coecient 2. at the scale 2u the gauge group
is broken to u(1) and the remaining charged elds cause the coupling to run toward weak
coupling, generating a logarithm of 2u/2 with beta-function coecient +2. below the
scale 2 the coupling ceases to run, and the low-energy coupling constant is

l =  +

1
i

4u (cid:21) ,
log(cid:20) 23

(9)

which depends only on u and on m2m3. evidently, the eects of raising m3 and lowering
m2 are being arranged to cancel. remarkably, this perturbative cancellation generalizes to
the full non-perturbative behavior of the holomorphic properties of the theory.

so far we have learned that varying some massive parameters in the theory of su(2) with
three adjoints can change the theory at non-zero momenta (inuencing the kahler potential
and massive states) while leaving the holomorphic part of the far-infrared physics the same.
in particular, sl(2, z) invariance is preserved. but now we may consider the limit where
|m3|  |u|,|m2|. below m3 we have the theory with superpotential eq. (1), along with a
mass for 2. for small q and |qm2
3|, the gauge coupling is weak everywhere

3|  |u|  |m2

6

and the analysis involving eqs. (8) and (9) still applies. in the limit m2  u/m3, we have
3  m3, 2  4u/m3, with 23 = 4u; the coupling runs with a beta function of 2
between m3 and 2u, then with beta function +2 between 2u and 2u/m3. thus, in the
m2  0 limit, all running eects above and below 2q|u| cancel precisely in eq. (9), and
we nd that the gauge coupling l of the low-energy u(1) theory is the same as that of the
high-energy theory,  , just as in the unbroken n = 4 gauge theory. this reects the fact
that the torus depends in this limit only on q and u, and not on m3. (another example of
this type appears in [9].)

as in the n = 4 theory, the limit u  0 leaves the torus a scale-invariant sl(2, z)-
invariant function of the parameter q = e2i . we take this as evidence that at u = m2 = 0
the theory eq. (1) ows to a non-trivial conformally invariant theory in the infrared. indeed
there is a set of conformal eld theories indexed by q, in agreement with [2] and eq. (2).

the full picture for the su(2) case is now the following. the n = 4 conformal theories
are parameterized by  , or equivalently q = e2i living on the disk |q|  1. these theories
are identied under sl(2, z) transformations. in the n = 1 conformal theories with two
adjoints and superpotential eq. (1), there is also a marginal parameter , which we may
choose to be numerically equal to  , such that q = e2i has the same properties as q in the
n = 4 theory. the limit q = 0 corresponds to h = 0, but the general relation between h
and q is nontrivial and presumably scheme-dependent. the transformations    1
 and
   + 1 correspond to electric-magnetic and magnetic-dyonic dualities. in the appendix
we show, using the integrating-in techniques of [10], that these claims agree with those
described in [3].

there are many other interesting n = 1 theories which will also have large discrete
invariance groups. the simplest can be generated by taking the theory of n = 2 su(2)
with four hypermultiplets. this theory was shown by seiberg and witten to have sl(2, z)
invariance as well [6]. the avor symmetry of the doublets is su(8), which is broken by
the n = 2 superpotential term to so(8). by giving masses to some of the quarks and
performing complexied so(8) transformations, we can again nd many theories with non-
renormalizable operators which are exactly marginal in the infrared, and whose couplings
transform under sl(2, z). examples of such theories appear in [11,12].

another related theory is n = 2 supersymmetric su(n)  su(n) with two hyper-
multiplets in the (n, n) representation. this has a duality group given by the symme-
try group of a torus with two identical marked points [13]. the superpotential w =
1(q1 q1 + q2 q2) + 2( q1q1 + q2q2) has a u(2) avor symmetry, broken by masses
mijqi qj, under which m is a triplet plus a singlet. if equal and opposite masses for the
hypermultiplets are added, a complexied avor rotation can leave the theory with mass
terms mq1 q2 + mq2 q1. with m nite and m = 0 we obtain a set of conformal theories,
with a quartic superpotential involving 1, 2, q1, q2, that inherits the duality group of its
parent.

our technique is a simple and powerful tool for showing that large duality groups are
widespread in n = 1 supersymmetry. it would be interesting to understand more deeply
the mathematical underpinning of these results, and to nd a brane-based realization of our
method.

appendix

in this appendix we show that the application of our techniques to the su(2) theory

with two adjoints reproduces the results of [3] for so(3) with two triplets.

consider su(2) n = 4 yang-mills with gauge coupling  deformed by n = 1preserving

masses, giving the superpotential

w = 2tr1[2, 3] + mijuij

2tr(ij). denote the three eigenvalues of mij by mi, and dene

where classically uij = 1
u  u11.
our complexied avor rotation trick implies that for m1 = 0, the low-energy eective
coupling l on the coulomb branch of this theory is equal to that of the su(2) n = 2
theory with a fundamental hypermultiplet of mass m2 = m2m3. in [6], l is given as the
modular parameter of the auxiliary torus

for xed m2m3 and u the torus is sl(2, z) invariant. this follows from the modular
properties of the ei, which are interchanged with one another under sl(2, z). in particular,
e1  e2 under   1/ , while e2  e3 under    + 1. note that with the denition of
u given in eq. (11), the coulomb branch coordinate hui transforms under sl(2, z).

8

there is, however, an ambiguity involved in the denitions of u and the masses. the

symmetries of the theory permit non-perturbative redenitions of the form

u  k1(q)u + q k2(q)m2m3,

ki(q) = 1 + o(q).

and

mi  i(q)mi,

i(q) = 1 + o(q).

(13)

(14)

the reason is that u and the bare masses are only dened in the weak coupling (q  0)
limit, which the above redenitions preserve. (more generally, uij  1
2tr(ij) and mij can
suer such redenitions, with uij mixing at order q with the subdeterminants of mij.)
it is convenient to use the above freedom to redene the masses by

m2m3  9e2(q)e3(q)m2m3,

(15)

which can be checked to be of the form of eq. (14) using eq. (12). the virtue of this
redenition is that, when used in eq. (11), hui is sl(2, z) invariant. this is convenient for
keeping manifest sl(2, z) invariance in our calculations when we integrate u out, as we will
do shortly.

we can now recover the results of [3] for the so(3) theory with two triplets and no

superpotential. this is the limit of our theory in which m3  , q  0 keeping   m3q

in [3] three descriptions of the theory were found, in terms of electric, magnetic,

and dyonic states. the electric description has no superpotential; the magnetic (dyonic)

matching to the electric, magnetic, and dyonic superpotentials of eq. (16), respectively.
in this way we see explicity how the sl(2, z) duality transformations    1
 and  
 + 1 correspond to electric-magnetic duality and magnetic-dyonic duality. a 2 subgroup
of sl(2, z) leaves the descriptions invariant, while sl(2, z)/2 = s3 permutes the three
descriptions. these facts were already understood in [3] from the connection of the theory
with the duality of n = 4 su(2) gauge theory; here we understand it as following from the
sl(2, z) duality of the n = 1 theory itself. furthermore, it is easy to check that redening
the elds and parameters by putting in arbitrary g(q), ki(q), and i(q) [see eqs. (4), (13),
and (14)] has no eect on the above calculation.

one could also attempt to start from the low energy superpotentials in eq. (17) and
integrate back in all three j; we then expect to recover the n = 4 theory with coupling q.
however, this is more dicult than in the above two-avor case because we must introduce
not only tr(ij) but also the the gauge invariant non-quadratic operator det(). (here 
is a 3  3 matrix in avor and color.) so we instead consider going in the other direction,
attempting to recover eq. (16) in the theory with two adjoints by integrating massive 3
out of the n = 4 theory.
consider the theory with three adjoints, superpotential w = 2 det , and coupling q.
for  = 1 the theory is conformal. for  6= 1 the theory has only n = 1 supersymmetry,
but ows until it reaches the ir attractive n = 4 xed point where the physical (nonholo-
morphic) coupling  = 1. as discussed in [3], the quantity t  4q is invariant under this
rg ow (more generally, 2c2(g)q is invariant), and the low-energy n = 4 conformal theory
has coupling t. the theory is nowhere weakly coupled unless t  1.
2m3u33 to the superpotential and integrating out 3, we nd that symmetries
ensure that the low-energy superpotential is

where s(t) is an unknown function.
(the symmetries ensure that in this case uij and
1
2tr(ij) are proportional, diering by another function of t.) for  xed and q  0,
the theory is weakly coupled and we may integrate out 3 classically, which reveals that
s(t = 0) = 1. at nite t, s(t) is undetermined. however, we know the  = 1, q  0 theory
is sl(2, z)dual to  = 1, q  1 and  = 1, q  e2i, which are the magnetic and dyonic
descriptions. in these descriptions, where t  1, the classical analysis is not valid, and s(t)
may dier from 1. we now determine s(1) in the scheme used in [3].
taking  = 1, q  0, m3  , with  = m3q1/2 held xed, eq. (18) obviously yields the
expected electric low-energy superpotential, eq. (16) with  = 0. a magnetic description

of the same theory should be obtained by studying the theory with  = 1 and q  1,
but it is convenient instead to study a theory with the same infrared physics, namely one
with  = q1/4 and q  0; both theories have t = 1. the latter theory can be dened by
holding the strong coupling scale   m3q1/2 xed, as in [3]. from eq. (18) this limit has
superpotential

which agrees with eq. (16) for  = 1 provided s(1) = 1/8. the dyonic description is given
by taking q  e2i, which changes the sign of the superpotential in agreement with eq. (16).
