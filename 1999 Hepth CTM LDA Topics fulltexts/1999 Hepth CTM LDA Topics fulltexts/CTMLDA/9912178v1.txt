abstract

a gauge transformation in quantum electrodynamics involves the product of eld
operators at the same space-time point and hence does not have a well-dened
meaning. one way to avoid this diculty is to generalize the gauge transformation
by using dierent space-time points in the spirit of diracs point splitting. such a
generalization indeed exists and the resulting generalized innitesimal gauge trans-
formation takes the form of an innite series in the coupling constant. in this text
i will present two examples of generalized gauge transformations.

1 introduction

it is well known that, in local quantum eld theory, one encounters divergences which arise
from taking products of eld operators at the same space-time point. as a result, these
products do not have a well-dened meaning. quite some time ago, dirac [1] suggested
point splitting as a remedy for this diculty: instead of taking all the eld operators at
the space-time point x, a xed four-vector  is introduced so that only eld operators
with dierent arguments (x, x  , . . .) appear in their products. as long as  is taken to
be dierent from 0, the products of eld operators are well dened and the theory can be
expected to be free of divergences, i.e., to be regularized. at the end of the calculation,
the limit   0 is taken, in order to recover the original theory.

a prioiri, there are many ways in which such a point splitting procedure can be
implemented. for gauge theories, however, one must ensure that the introduction of this
new parameter  preserves the invariance under gauge transformations. it thus appears
reasonable that one rst attempts to construct gauge transformations involving products
of eld operators taken at dierent space-time points, which we shall call generalized
gauge transformations. once such generalized gauge transformations are found, one can
then attempt to construct an action, which is invariant under these generalized gauge
transformations.

in this paper, i shall show how these ideas can be put to work for the u(1) gauge
symmetry, although several aspects can be carried over to the general yang-mills case [2,
3].

2 framework

the standard innitesimal gauge transformations, , for the photon eld a(x) and the
dirac eld (x) in the abelian u(1) case take the form

 a(x) =  (x) ,
 (x) =  e (x) (x) ,
 (x) =  e (x) (x) ,

(1)

where (x) is the gauge parameter. the gauge transformations of the elds satisfy the
u(1) group property: the commutator of two subsequent gauge transformations vanishes.
in what follows, i shall require that the generalized gauge transformations preserve
this abelian character, i.e., two such generalized transformations should commute. this
requirement imposes strong restrictions on the form such transformations can take. nev-
ertheless, it was found that such innitesimal transformations can be constructed and
that, for gauge transformations on the fermion elds, they take the form of an innite
series in powers of the coupling constant e:

 (x) =



xn=1

en (n)

 (x) .

(2)

this is to be contrasted with the standard u(1) case without point splitting, where the
nite gauge transformations on the fermion eld are of innite order in the coupling
constant, the innitesimal ones in eqs. (1) being only of rst order in e.

1

the action a, invariant under these innitesimal generalized gauge transformations,

is also an innite series in the coupling constant e:

a = z d4x l(x) =



xn=0

en z d4x l(n)(x) ,

(3)

where l(x) is the lagrangian density and l(n)(x) its expansion in powers of e. the action
being an innite series in e leads to new peculiar feynman rules. besides the one-photon
vertex, there are in this generalized theory also two-, three-, four-, . . . photon vertices.

in sections 3 and 4, i shall present two explicit examples of generalized gauge trans-

formations.

3 first example

perhaps the simplest ansatz one can imagine for generalized gauge transformations is

 a(x) =  (x) ,
(1)
 (x) =  (x + ) (x + 2) ,

(4)

where  is the point splitting four-vector as discussed in the introduction. to satisfy the
abelian group property, one can take, e.g.,

(2)
 (x) = 

1
2

[(x + ) + (x + 3)] (x + 4)z x+3

x+

dy a(y),

(5)

and so on for the higher order terms.

when   0, then (1)

 (x)  0. the general proof that the higher order terms (n)

 (x) reduces to the standard gauge transformation [eqs. (1)],
 (x) indeed exist,

and (2)
can be found in ref. [4].

the expansion of the corresponding invariant action then yields the following lowest

order results for the lagrangian density:

1
l(0) = (x) (    m) (x) 
4
l(1) = (x  )  (x + ) a(x) ,

f(x) f (x) ,

l(2) =

(x  2)  (x + 2)

1
2

(cid:20)[a(x  ) + a(x + )]z x+
+[z x

dy a(y) +z x+

x

x

x

dya(y)

dy a(y)] z x+

x

dy f(y)(cid:21) .

(6)

(7)

(8)

it is now obvious that through the incorporation of point splitting in the gauge transfor-
mation, one obtains a nonlocal lagrangian density. it is also non-hermitian. if   0 then
l(1) reduces to the standard qed interaction lagrangian density, and l(n)  0 for n  2.

the appearance of innite line integrals is an unattractive feature of this approach,

which will be remedied in section 4.

2

4 second example

in this example, the separation between the dierent space-time points is still character-
ized by a xed four-vector , but for the construction of the innitesimal generalized gauge
transformations, one takes an average over the separation in  using a weight function
(). the generalized gauge transformations of the fermion elds are again innite series,
the rst order term being

(1)

 (x) = z +



() dz +



() dz +



 (x + ( + )) (x + ( + )) .

() d

(9)

to avoid innite line integrals, the weight function () is taken to be real and even. it
is also normalized

d () = 1 ,

(10)

z +



which guarantees that (1)
it must obey the convolution property

 (x) reduces to the expression in eqs. (1) when   0. finally,

z +



d () (  ) = () .

an example of a function satisfying these four conditions is

() =

1


sin()



.

in momentum space, the generalized gauge transformations [eq. (9)] become :

(1)

 (k) = z d4k1z d4k2 (4)(k  k1  k2) (k1) (k2) (k1  )

 (k2  ) ((k1 + k2)  ) ,

(11)

(12)

(13)

with () the fourier transform of (), (k) and (k) being the fourier transforms of
(x) and (x) respectively. the properties of () translate into the following properties
of (): (i) () is real and even; (ii) (0) = 1; (iii) 2() = (), implying that () = 0
or 1. for the example in eq. (12), one has that

() = ( 1,

0,

if || < 1
if ||  1 .

(14)

to satisfy the abelian group property of section 2, one can take, e.g.,

(2)

 (k) = z d4k1z d4k2z d4k3 (4)(k  k1  k2  k3)



a(k1)  

k1  

(k2) (k3) [1  ((k2 + k3)  )]

 (k1  ) (k2  ) (k3  ) ((k1 + k2 + k3)  ) .

(15)

and so on for the higher order terms [5].
denominator in eq. (15), the expression for (2)

in spite of the appearance of k1   in the
 (k) is free of singularities for k1    0.

3

to see this, it suces to observe that, for k1    0, ((k1 + k2 + k3)  )  ((k2 + k3)  )
and that [1  ()] () = 0 for all .

through this example, the relation between point splitting and the mitigation of
if the function () is taken as in eq. (14),
ultraviolet divergences becomes apparent.
then, in eq. (13) for (1)
 (k), the functions (k1  ), (k2  ) and ((k1 + k2)  ) cut
o the high momentum components in the direction of  of (k1), (k2) and (1)
 (k)
respectively. a similar property holds for the second order term in eq. (15), and it is also
valid for the higher order terms.

these generalized gauge transformations reduce to the standard gauge transformations

in the limit   0. indeed, the rst order term (1)

 (k) [eq. (13)] reduces to

(1)

 (k) = z d4k1z d4k2 (4)(k  k1  k2) (k1) (k2) ,

(16)

because (0) = 1. eq. (16) is exactly the fourier transform of the standard innitesi-
mal gauge transformation of eq. (1). furhermore, when   0, the second order term
(2)
 (k)  0 in eq. (15), and similarly for the higher order terms (n)
 (k) for n > 2.
again, one can construct a generalized action, invariant under these generalized gauge
transformations, the details of which are given in ref. [5].

the advantage of the approach in this second example is that it can also be generalized
to the case of yang-mills theories [2, 3]. in those cases, one nds that it is absolutely
necessary to average in the generalized gauge transformations over the dierent arguments
for the eld operators.

one is still faced with a shortcoming in this approach: the momentum cut o of the
functions only occures in the direction of the four-vector , and, as a result, one cannot
expect that all ultraviolet divergences are regulated.

5 conclusions

we have shown that it is possible to construct generalized gauge transformations for
which the elds and the gauge parameters are taken at dierent space-time points. the
separation between the dierent space-time points is characterized by a xed four-vector
. two examples of generalized gauge transformations and invariant actions are presented
here. it appears that the generalized innitesimal gauge transformations of the fermion
elds and the invariant actions are innite series in the coupling constant e. in the limit
  0, they reduce to the standard expressions one encounters in qed. in the second
example, the conditions which the weight function has to satisfy lead to the introduction
of a cut o for the large momentum components of the elds in the direction of . we
are thus led to consider generalized gauge transformations which only act on the small
momentum components of the elds.
