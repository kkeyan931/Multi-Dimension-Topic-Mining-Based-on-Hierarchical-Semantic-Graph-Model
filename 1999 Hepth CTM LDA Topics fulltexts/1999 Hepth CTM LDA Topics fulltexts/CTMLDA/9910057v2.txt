it is pointed out that it is very unlikely that we can nd analytical solutions built up from elementary
functions for the domain wall junctions problem in wess-zumino models possessing a trivial kahler
potential.

recently bps saturated intersecting domain walls
(bps junctions from now on) have attracted attention
of many authors [13]. in particular, it has been argued
[1,2] that in n = 1 supersymmetric theories bps junc-
tions preserves 1/4 of the original supersymmetry, i.e.
only one super charge (out of four) acts trivially on the
junctions.

this fact makes particularly interesting the question
of whether or not such junctions (if they exist at all) can
be constructed explicitly.

in [2] this problem was studied in detail; in sec. vi
of this paper an explicit solution was suggested in the
case of a generalized wess-zumino model possessing a
z4 symmetry. since the ansatz proposed there for the
superpotential prole w(z, z) seems the only reasonable
one we can write in terms of elementary function, we
can address the issue of its validity in the case of trivial
kahler potential (in [2] it was shown that this is a so-
lution of the bps equations for some non-trivial kahler
potential).

to be specic, we consider a wess-zumino model de-
scribing a single chiral supereld with the superpotential

w =  

1

n + 1

n +1.

(1)

this model exhibits a zn symmetry, with n chirally

asymmetric vacuum states at

k = k,

n (cid:19) ,
k = 0, 1, . . . , n  1,  = exp(cid:18) 2i

(2)

where  represents the lowest component of the supereld
.

we are interested in the bps junctions interpolating
amongst these vacua, and which satisfy the creek equa-
tion [1,4]

z =

1

2(cid:0)1  n(cid:1) ,

(3)

where the usual phase appearing in the r.h.s. of (3) has
been absorbed via a suitable redenition of the complex
coordinate z = x + iy.

note, in fact, that unlike the case of the domain walls
one has to promote z to be a complex variable; moreover
no holomorphic dependence for the eld  on z is allowed
(in such a case we can basically patch together domain

wall solution in each sector, via a conformal mapping

to call a junction).

such as z ezn : this is anyway not what we would like

it is useful then to introduce the parameterization  =

exp( + i) and z = r exp(i), so that

2z = exp(i)(cid:18)r 

i
r

(cid:19) .

equation (3) then reduces to the following system of
coupled non linear partial dierential equations:

r +

r

 = exp() cos(  )

r

r

 exp[(n  1)] cos(  ) cos(n )
 exp[(n  1)] sin(  ) sin(n ),

 = exp() sin(  )

+ exp[(n  1)] cos(  ) sin(n )
 exp[(n  1)] sin(  ) cos(n ).

(6)

trying to nd analytical solutions of this system is out
of question. however, we can look at its asymptotics, by
studying the behavior of the eld prole  in the sector
0 <  < 2/n when r  . in this sector at r   one
has ,   0, so that, linearizing the previous equations,
we nd

r +

 = n  sin  + n  cos 
r

(8)

despite of its cute form (it actually says to us that the
dierential operator appearing in the l.h.s. of (7) and (8)
acts on the solution (,) as a rotation) we were unable
to nd the general solution of this system.
let us consider the case n = 4. in this case the fol-
lowing ansatz for the superpotential prole has been pro-
posed in [2]

w(z, z) =(cid:18) 2  2i
=(cid:18) 2  2i

5 (cid:19){tanh(z + z)  i tanh[i(z  z)]}
5 (cid:19) [tanh(2r cos ) + i tanh(2r sin )] ,

(9)

(our w is their w , and we set for convenience  = 1).
despite the fact that eq. (9) represents the superpo-
tential prole rather then the junction prole, we can
extract from it important information, as the asymptotic
behavior of the junction.

recall in fact that we are considering the sector 0 <
 < /2 and r  , where the eld must approach the
vacuum value 0 = 1 (and w(0) = 1). first of all note
that in this region we have

tanh(2r cos )  1  ,  = 2 exp[4r cos ] > 0,
 = 2 exp[4r sin ] > 0,
tanh(2r sin )  1  ,
so that

w(r, )

i(  ).

on the other hand, since

 = exp( + i)  1 +  + i,

we also get

w =

(14)

in this way, we get the following system of equations

for  and

(16)

which has the solutions

(18)

(17)

10 = q( + ) +p2(2 + 2),
10 = q( + ) +p2(2 + 2),
now, both  and  are of order     exp(2r);

(due to the fact that ,  > 0 and that  and  are real,
two solutions of the quartic equation coming from the
system above can be discarded).

thus we must check that at this order they satisfy the
linearized equation of motion. let us look at the + solu-
tion (similar results will hold true for the  solution); in
this case, supposing  6= , we get the following relation
for eq. (7) (recall that n = 4)

now each square bracket must be equal to zero, and it

is easy to see that this is not the case.

in the case  = , i.e. on the line of constant phase
 = /4, eq. (19) gets simplied (in particular note that
in this case  = 0) but the same result holds: it is not
satised.

thus the superpotential prole (9), despite the fact
that it has the correct asymptotic behavior (reproducing
correctly all the values of the superpotential in the vacua
of the theory) and satises the integral of motion xw2 =
yw1 (where we have switched to the parameterization
w = w1 + iw2 and z = x + iy), does not go trough the
bps equations, in the case of trivial kahler potential.
following these lines of reasoning we also tried to see
if it was possible to generalize this ansatz, for example
by choosing as arguments of the tanhs in (9) two arbi-
trary functions f and g with appropriate dependence on z
and z and suitable boundary conditions in each dierent
sector of the n = 4 junction. unfortunately this gener-
alized ansatz for the superpotential prole w(z, z) fails
too: nding f and g is of the same diculty of nding the
solution of our original creek equation. moreover, such
an ansatz for the junction prole (z, z) fails as well: it
simply does not go through the linearized equations of
motion.

concluding, given the complexity of the creek equation
(3), and the fact that one is able to write down an ansatz
for the prole functions only in the case n = 4 (as rst
done in [2]), it seems to us very unlikely that we will nd
analytical solutions describing bps junctions (or even
only their asymptotic behavior) in wess-zumino models
with trivial kahler potential; numerical investigation is
the only way to shed light on this issue.
