abstract

the superspace atness conditions which are equivalent to the
eld equations of supersymmetric yang-mills theory in ten dimen-
sions have not been useful so far to derive non trivial classical solu-
tions. recently, modied atness conditions were proposed, which are
explicitly integrable [10], and are based on the breaking of symmetry
so(9, 1)  so(2, 1)  so(7).
in this article, we investigate their
physical content. to this end, group-algebraic methods are developed
which allow to derive the set of physical elds and their equations of
motion from the supereld expansion of the supercurl, systematically.
a set of integrable superspace constraints is identied which dras-
tically reduces the eld content of the unconstrained supereld but
leaves the spectrum including the original yang-mills vector eld com-
pletely o-shell. a weaker set of constraints gives rise to additional
elds obeying rst order dierential equations. geometrically, the
so(7) covariant superspace constraints descend from a truncation of
wittens original linear system to particular one-parameter families of
light-like rays.

1 introduction.

recently, progress was made in applying exact integration methods to su-
persymmetric yang-mills theory in ten dimensions starting from the atness
conditions in superspace which have been known for some time to be equiv-
alent to the eld equations [14, 19]. it was shown in [10], that there exists
an on-shell light cone gauge, where the superelds may be entirely expressed
in terms of a scalar supereld satisfying two sets of equations. the rst is
linear and the general solution was derived; the second is similar to yangs
equations and has been handled by methods similar to earlier studies of self-
dual yang-mills in four dimensions. a general class of exact solutions3 has
been obtained [10] and a backlund transformation put forward [7].

so far, however,

it has not been possible to simultaneously solve the
two sets of equations. only a particular class of solutions of the yang type
equations has been found, which is not general enough to solve the other
(linear) set. returning to a general gauge, one may see that deriving the
scalar supereld satisfying the linear subset of equations is equivalent [7]
to solving a particular symmetrized form of the atness conditions. this
symmetrized form was shown to be explicitly integrable directly, since it
arises [8, 9] as compatibility condition of a lax representation, similar to the
one of belavin and zakharov [2], which may be handled by the same powerful
techniques as in the case of self-dual yang-mills in four dimensions.

the goal of this article is a systematic study of these integrable modica-
tions of the original atness conditions in superspace. we shall refer to them
as the integrable superspace constraint  as opposed to the strong superspace
constraint which describes vanishing of the full super eld strength and is
equivalent to the yang-mills system. since the proof of this equivalence is
recursive and rather tedious [14, 19, 12, 1], a priori it is not clear which mod-
ication of the eld content and dynamics is implied by a modication of the
strong superspace constraint.

an important property of the integrable superspace constraint is that it
explicitly breaks the original so(9, 1) lorentz symmetry down to so(2, 1) 
so(7). for weyl-majorana spinors and in particular the grassmann coor-
dinates in superspace, this leads to the separation 16  8 + 8, (where the

not essential.

r.h.s. denotes a pair of so(7) spinor representations which form a doublet
under so(2, 1)). this is instrumental in dening the involution which is the
key to applying methods modeled over the bosonic self-duality requirement
in four dimensions; here, the analogous construction involves the exchange
of the two spinor representations.

in the rest of the paper we concentrate upon deriving the eld content and
dynamical equations induced by the integrable superspace constraint. since
this constraint is weaker than the original (strong) superspace constraint,
we eectively go partially o-shell. there are more physical elds in the
supereld components and the dynamics is modied. at this point, it is
worth recalling that, in the standard treatment [12, 1], the method used to
eliminate the unphysical components of the superelds makes an essential
use of the equations of motion. it is thus not applicable to our case. one of
the aims of the present work is to devise a more direct and general method,
which is also applicable to our modied equations.

after reviewing superspace notations, in section 2 we introduce the origi-
nal (strong) and the modied (integrable) superspace constraints. we explain
the geometrical origin of the integrable superspace constraint as particular
truncation of the lax representation in superspace [19]. this original lax
representation, associated with the strong superspace constraint, is formu-
lated for light-like rays in ten dimensions, which play the role of spectral
parameters. restricting the connection to certain one-parameter families of
light rays (spanning a three-manifold) makes the system accessible to the
techniques developed in [2] for four-dimensional self-dual yang-mills theory.
with a particular choice of three-manifold, this gives back the integrable
superspace constraint. for the subsequent analysis it is helpful to further
introduce a slightly stronger version of this constraint corresponding to an
eective reduction of the lax representation to seven dimensions and referred
to as the reduced integrable constraint. due to the fact that this reduced con-
straint commutes with the action of the symmetric group on spinor indices,
it eventually turns out to be completely soluble, which essentially simplies
the analysis of the integrable constraint.

the rest of the paper is devoted to studying eld content and dynamics
induced by the integrable and the reduced integrable superspace constraints.
section 3 presents a systematic general study of the expansion of the super-
eld equations in powers of the odd variables . we derive recursion relations
with an interesting structure. the elimination of unphysical components of

3

superelds is done recursively and involves two operators noted s and t .
the rst satises a simple quadratic equation while the second is nilpotent.
thus our equations bear some analogy with the descent equations [20]. the
eld equations are enforced by further applying a projector k, and we thus
study the interplay between s, t , and k on general ground.

applying this method to the integrable superspace constraints, in sec-
tion 4, we explicitly identify the induced physical eld content. as a result,
we nd a spectrum which is essentially larger than the original yang-mills
system. for the reduced integrable constraint it consists of 384+384 elds
which correspond to three copies of the ten-dimensional o-shell multiplet
[3]; the integrable constraint then gives rise to additional 31+16 elds. sec-
tion 5 is devoted to deriving explicit recurrent relations which determine the
higher order supereld components in terms of these elds.

finally, in section 6 we derive the eld equations which are induced by
the superspace constraints. the spectrum associated with the reduced inte-
grable constraint remains completely o-shell, whereas the additional elds
appearing with the integrable constraint satisfy a set of rst order dierential
equations. a discussion of this dynamics and some concluding remarks are
given at the end.

2 superspace constraints and lax represen-

tation.

2.1 supereld conventions

the notations are essentially the same as in the previous references. the
physical elds are noted as follows: xa(x) is the vector potential, (x) is the
majorana-weyl spinor. both are matrices in the adjoint representation of the
gauge group g. latin indices a = 0, . . . , 9 describe minkowski components,
greek indices  = 1, . . . , 16 denote spinor components. we use the dirac
matrices

a =

01616

(cid:16)(a)(cid:17)

we will use the superspace formulation with 16 odd coordinates . the
general supereld expansions of a supereld  (x, ) may be written as

(x, ) =

[p](x, ) 

16xp=0

the grading is given by the operator

r =  ,

superderivatives are dened by

[p]

d =    (a) a ,

such that

[d , d ]+ = 2 (a) a .

(2.4)

the odd super vector potential, valued in the adjoint representation of the
gauge group, is denoted by a (x, ). we dene its supercurl m as

m  da + da + [a, a]+  f  2 (a) aa ,

(2.5)

(2.6)

this gives the decomposition of the supercurl into the super eld strength f
and the even vector potential aa (x, ) as functions of a.4 the supereld
formalism is invariant under gauge transformations

a 7 g1a g + g1dg ,
f
aa

7 g1f g ,
7 g1aa g + g1ag ,

(2.7)

with an even supereld g (x, ) as gauge parameter. imposing the so-called
recursion gauge condition

a = 0

(2.8)

restricts the freedom (2.7) to ordinary gauge freedom, i.e. to gauge parame-
ters g with [r, g] = 0.

4in the terminology of [15], we have hence resolved the conventional constraint

(a)f = 0.

5

2.2 superspace constraints

it is known that the equations of motion of super yang mills theory in ten
dimensions may equivalently be expressed as vanishing of the super curvature

f = 0 .

(2.9)

more precisely, it has been shown in [14, 19, 12, 1] that the recursion gauge
condition (2.8) together with the atness conditions (2.9) implies the yang-
mills equations of motion

afab + [ aa , fab ] =

(a) (cid:0)a +(cid:2) aa , (cid:3)(cid:1) = 0 ,

(2.10)

for the superelds aa and , the latter being dened as   (a) fa
with the curvature

fa  (daa  aa + [ a , aa ] ) .

(2.11)

moreover, (2.8) and (2.9) yield a unique recurrent prescription of the higher
order supereld components in aa,  and a as functions of the zero order
contributions

xa  a[0]
a ,

   [0] ,

(2.12)

these zero order components in particular satisfy the usual supersymmetric
yang-mills equations of motion.

for the purpose of this paper we rewrite the vanishing super curvature
condition (2.9) in terms of the supercurl m. it is convenient to introduce
the general space of superelds symmetric in two additional spinor indices
(), which we denote by m. this space carries the grading (2.2):

m =

m[p] 

16mp=0

16mp=0(cid:8)v(),[1...p] 1 . . . p(cid:9) .

the superspace constraint (2.9) corresponds to setting ba1...a5 = 0 and may
be written as a projection condition kym on the supercurl

this paper is devoted to a study of other (weaker) supereld constraints
which replace (2.15) and have appeared as completely integrable supereld
equations in [8, 9]. obviously, (2.15) is the only so(9, 1) covariant constraint
that can be imposed on the supercurl. we hence break the original so(9, 1)
lorentz invariance of the system down to so(2, 1)  so(7); the reason for
this particular choice will become clear the following.
it is in this setting
that the modied constraints have appeared in [10, 8, 9].

for weyl-majorana spinors, this symmetry breaking leads to the separa-

tion

16  (2, 8) :

 7 (, ) , ,  = 1, . . . , 8 ,

(2.16)

where the r.h.s. denotes a pair of so(7) spinor representations which form a
doublet under so(2, 1) such that    denotes the so(7) invariant invo-
lution. in appendix a we have collected the conventions about decomposing
the so(9, 1) -matrices into so(8) -matrices.

the supercurl m correspondingly decomposes into

m = 10+126 7 (3, 1) + (1, 7) + (1, 21) + (3, 35)

(2.17)

the superspace constraints which we are going to study in this paper are

the following projections

kym : m  (3, 1) + (1, 7)

ki : m  (3, 1) + (1, 7) + (1, 21)

kir : m  (1, 7) + (1, 21)

(2.18)

(2.19)

(2.20)

the rst constraint is the original vanishing super curvature condition (2.15)
which corresponds to the yang-mills system. the latter two constraints have
appeared in [8, 9] as compatibility equations of completely integrable lax
representations. we will refer to them as to the integrable and the reduced

7

integrable constraint, respectively. note, that the truncation (2.20) is gauge
covariant only after dimensional reduction of the system to seven dimensions.
before analyzing the eld content and dynamics implied by these super-
eld constraints we rst recall how they may be obtained as compatibility
equations of lax representations in superspace.

2.3 lax representations

in this section we recall the original linear system [19] associated with the
vanishing curvature condition (2.18), and show how the integrable constraints
(2.19), (2.20) may be obtained as certain truncations thereof.

the atness conditions (2.9), (2.18) possess a lax type representation in
superspace [19]. they imply the existence of a g-valued supereld [] for
any light-like ten-dimensional vector , which is dened by the linear system

a (a) {d + a} [] = 0 ,

(2.21)

a {a  aa} [] = 0 .

in turn, the compatibility conditions of (2.21) imply (2.9). clearly, these
equations are invariant under multiplication by an overall constant, so that
 only depends upon the light-like ray considered.

equations (2.21) may be considered as a lax representation of the eld
equations (2.10) where the light-like vector  plays the role of the spectral
parameter. as they stand, however, they have not been very useful in prac-
tice, i.e. with regard to the powerful solution generating methods applicable
in lower dimensional systems. the constraints (2.19) and (2.20), in con-
trast, are derivable from a lax representation where the spectral parameter
is a complex number  instead of a light ray, such that methods inspired
from ref. [2] become applicable [9, 7]. starting from equations (2.21), the
integrable constraints geometrically correspond to keeping only the atness
conditions associated with a particular one parameter subset () of light-like
rays.

breaking the original so(9, 1) invariance we introduce the following

parametrization for light-like rays  = (, ~v):

 = i

,

i = vi ,

for

i = 1, . . . , 8 ,

  0  9 ,

(2.22)

with a complex number  and an eight-dimensional unit vector vi. the vector
vi provides a mapping between the two spinor representations of so(8) via
~v
 = ~v  ~ (cf. appendix a).

the linear system (2.21) then takes the form

~v

(2.24)

we are now going to show, that the superspace constraints (2.18), (2.19),
and (2.20) arise as compatibility equations of certain truncations of (2.23):

kym :

impose (2.23) for all vectors ~v

(2.25)

kir :

impose (2.23) for a xed vector ~v

impose (2.23) for a xed vector ~v
and reduce the linear system to seven dimensions

commutator of the lax connection (2.23) with itself, thereby implying

  f + i(12) (~v

for all values of  and ~v and hence vanishing of the supercurvature (2.9).

for a xed choice of the vector ~v on the other hand, these conditions

imply

this precisely corresponds to the projection (2.19). if furthermore we assume
independence of the solution  of the lax pair (2.23) of the three coordinates

 = 0 = ~v ~  ,

the second equation of (2.23) shows that

(2.27)

(2.28)

a =  1(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)=1
~v ~a =  (~v ~ + i9)1(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)=0

 ia9 = 0 .

together with (2.26), this implies the following stronger truncation on the
supercurl

m = 0 ,

m = 0 ,

(2.29)

(~v

m + ~v

 m) = 0 ,

corresponding to the projection (2.20). this nishes the proof of (2.25). we
have hence shown, that the superspace constraints (2.19) and (2.20) arise as
integrability conditions of the lax pair (2.23) upon truncating the spectral
parameter to a particular one parameter family of light-like rays.

the advantage of the reduced lax connection comes from the fact that
for xed choice of ~v, the linear system (2.23) is similar to the one proposed
by belavin and zakharov for four-dimensional self-dual yang-mills theory [2]
and similar techniques may successfully be applied. the role of the invo-
lution which in that case describes self-duality is played by exchanging the
two so(8) spinor representations by means of ~v  ~, here. this explains
the particular choice of breaking the original lorentz symmetry down to
so(9, 1)  so(2, 1)  so(7). upon this reduction, the system (2.23) may
be solved starting from an ansatz which is meromorphic in . this leads to
purely algebraic equations  coming from the fact that the bracket in equa-
tion (2.23) is linear in   which may be solved in essentially the same way
as was done for the self-dual yang-mills theory. in this sense, the constraints
(2.19) and (2.20) arise as completely integrable supereld equations.

in contrast, it seems impossible to carry out the next step and solve
the system for all ~v, which would really give a solution of the full yang-mills

10

equations in ten dimensions. indeed, equation (2.24) implies that the bracket
in (2.23) should be linear in ~v.~, a very strong requirement, which to satisfy
there seems to exists no systematic method.

the situation further simplies upon dropping the coordinate dependence
according to (2.27). it should be noted that this is a natural but stronger
requirement than solely restricting the coordinate dependence of the super-
eld components of m (cf. [4] for a discussion of the reduction to four
dimensions). with the original linear system (2.21) for example, dimension-
ally reduced physical congurations generically induce functions  which
still depend on the compactied coordinates. restricting to dimensionally
reduced functions  corresponds to imposing further supereld constraints
(2.29).

relaxing the original superspace constraints however corresponds to going
partially o-shell and gives rise to additional elds appearing in the higher
order supereld components. our goal in the following is to extract the eld
and the dynamical content associated with the integrable subset of super-
space constraints.

3 systematics of the supercurl expansion.

in the following, we study the purely algebraic problem to determine the
eld and dynamical content, induced by imposing the constraints (2.18)
(2.20) on the superelds. to this end, we rst review the level structure
of the superelds and show how to systematically extract eld content and
equations.

for the original set of constraints (2.26) this has been discussed in detail
in [12, 1] (and likewise in [11] for the reduction to n = 3 supersymmetric
yang-mills theory in four dimensions). however, this discussion makes an
essential use of the yang-mills eld equations, and thus does not apply to
our case. the purpose of this paper is to present an alternative method. as
central object we consider the supercurl m.

11

3.1 algebraic structure of the recursion gauge condi-

tion

if we do not impose any constraint on the superelds, we simply have to
take into account the fact that the gauge freedom (2.7) has been xed by
the recursion gauge condition (2.8) to gauge parameters which do not have
higher order supereld components. for the components of the super vector
potential this implies

a = 0



a[p]

[,1...p] = 0 ,

(3.1)

which is still invariant under ordinary gauge transformations.

this shows that the independent components in the supereld a are
given by the following sum of young diagrams5 for the spinor representation
16 of so(9, 1)

recurrence relations
since later on we are going to study the eld equa-
tions implied by further constraining the supercurl m, we rst identify the
remaining independent eld components in m after imposing the recursion
gauge condition. equation (3.1) yields

(1 + r) a = m

(3.3)

5here, and in the following,

the notion of young diagrams always refers to
(anti)symmetrizing the factors of a tensor product v n of a given representation v ,
i.e. always to the young diagrams of the corresponding permutation group sn .

using (3.3) we may then re-express this relation entirely in terms of m. it
is convenient to write it in the form

moreover, the non linear term c is given by

note, that the operator s commutes with r whereas t raises the level
by 2. thus, (3.4) indeed builds a recursive system, relating the higher levels
of m to the image of the lower ones under t .

algebraic properties of s and t by explicit computation one veries
that the operator s satises the equation

(s  2) (s + r) = 0

(3.8)

thus, at a given level r = p, the operator s has only two dierent eigenval-
ues. we may hence decompose m into the eigenspaces of s:

m = m+ + m ,

(s + r) m+ = 0 ,

(s  2) m = 0 .

moreover, one may verify the algebraic relations

t 2 = 0 ,

(s  2) t = 0 = t (s + r) ;

(3.11)

(3.12)

i.e. the level raising operator t is nilpotent and acts nontrivially only between
m+ and m:

t : m+ [p]  m [p+2] .

(3.13)

the non linear terms of the eld equations (3.4) are lumped into c. in the
weak eld approximation the right hand side of this equation is negligible.
since t is nilpotent, there is then an interesting analogy between equation
(3.4) and the descent equations [20]. however, these involve in general two
nilpotent operators, whereas in our case s satises equation (3.8) instead of
being nilpotent.

general solution let us separate the two eigenvalues of s in equation
(3.4) according to (3.9). it is easy to verify that c+ = 0. thus one gets

t m  = 0,

rm  + t m + = c.

the rst relation is automatically satised because of (3.12). in conclusion,
m + is arbitrary, and

m  = r1(cid:0)c  t m +(cid:1)

(3.14)

thus, m + contains the independent components in m left over by the
gauge xing (3.1). comparing the young diagrams (3.10) to (3.2) we hence

14

recover the independent components identied in the vector potential a
after imposing the recursion gauge. the total and the independent number
of components of m [p] are respectively given by

p(cid:19),
dim m[p] = 136(cid:18)16

p + 2(cid:19).
dim m+ [p] = (p + 1)(cid:18) 17

(3.15)

we give a computation of these numbers in appendix b. altogether, m
contains 983041 independent components. since the gauge xing (3.1) is
dened by covariant constraints on the supereld, these components are nec-
essarily expressible in terms of representations of the supersymmetry algebra
(2.4). of course, supersymmetry is not realized level by level. decomposing
m + into so(9) multiplets, we nd the following structure

xp

dim m+[p] = 983041

(3.16)

= 1 + (44 + 84 + 128)  (9 + 16 + 36 + 126 + 128 + 231 +

+ 432 + 576 + 594 + 768 + 924) .

the 256 = (44 + 84 + 128) corresponds precisely to the smallest irreducible
o-shell multiplet of the 10d supersymmetry algebra (2.4) [3]. consistently,
m + forms a multiple of this multiplet. the additional singlet in (3.16) cor-
responds to the fact that we have not xed the ordinary gauge invariance.

dual space for future use, let us recall that we can introduce the dual
space mdual of superelds by means of the bilinear form

hf |gi =z d x ef  (x, ) g (x, )

|gi  m ,

hf |  mdual ,

where

(3.17)

breaking the o(9, 1) invariance, one may identify m and mdual by means of
0
, for example. with respect to the decomposition so(9, 1)  so(2, 1) 
so(7), the bilinear form (3.17) then yields an so(7) invariant scalar product.

15

on m, on which the so(2, 1) generators act as we are going to use this scalar
product in the subsequent analysis of the supereld constraints (2.25). note
nally, that with respect to this scalar product the operator s from (3.5) is
self-adjoint

sad = s .

(3.18)

3.2 extracting dynamics from the superspace con-

straints

so far in this section, we have restricted the supercurl m only by the recur-
sion gauge condition (3.1), thereby restricting the gauge freedom (2.7). fur-
ther restrictions and in particular dynamical equations arise from imposing
further constraints (2.18), (2.19), and (2.20), respectively, on the supercurl.
these constraints have been casted into the form of projections under an
operator k, k 2 = k, k  i  k, such that m is subject to


 m = 0 .

k

(3.19)

this denes a decomposition of the superelds in m into

m = km + km  mk + m .

(3.20)

the role of k is twofold. first, it further restricts the eld content in the su-
pereld m by certain algebraic relations; secondly, it implies eld equations
for the remaining independent supereld components.

the explicit projectors for the dynamical constraints (2.18), (2.19), and

(2.20) are given by

cf. appendix a). these projectors are self-adjoint w.r.t. to the scalar product
(3.17), i.e. kym = k ad

ym, etc.

note, that ki is the weakest of these constraints in the sense that

kymm  kim ,

(3.24)

in the following, we are going to analyze the content of these sets of
superspace constraints. to this end, we rst give the general recipe how
to obtain eld content and eld equations implied by a constraint of the
type (3.19) and subsequently apply this formalism to the constraints (3.21),
(3.22), and (3.23).

field content to identify the physical eld content among the components
of the supercurl m, we collect the constraints that have been imposed on
m. these are given by the recursion gauge expressed by (3.4) and the
constraint (3.19):

(s + r) m = 

r + 2

r

k m = 0 .

t m + c ,

(3.25)

this obviously leaves

m+

k  mk  m+ = ker k  ker (s + r) ,

(3.26)

undetermined. the independent (or physical) supereld components in m
are hence given by m+
k , the space of eigenvectors of the operator ksk with
eigenvalue p. the remaining part of m is consequently determined by
the system (3.25) in terms of derivatives and nonlinear combinations of the
physical elds. the fact that this part is in fact overdetermined by (3.25)
then in turn implies the eld equations as we shall discuss now.

field equations the dynamical equations arise from combining the two
equations of (3.25) into

k = hz| (s + r) k m [p] = 0 ,

vectors hz| are hence simultaneous eigenvectors of k ad with zero eigenvalue
and of sad with eigenvalue 2

hz| (s + r) k = 0 ,

we denote them as hz
with eigenvalue
2. (as discussed above, for the superspace constraint we nd that s, ki, and
kir are self-adjoint w.r.t. the scalar product induced by (3.17).) for any
such eigenvector hz

where the numbers on the l.h.s. can simply be extracted from the represen-

levels, these tables are collected in appendix c.

4 the physical eld content.

in this chapter, we will determine the eld content which is induced by the
dierent dynamical constraints kym, ki, and kir. the result for the latter
is summarized in the tables (4.13) and (4.17). we recall, that with the
strong superspace constraint (2.15), the arbitrariness in the supercurl m is

18

restricted to the levels p = 0 and p = 1, i.e. all higher levels are determined.
by analyzing the bianchi identities for the supercurvature one veries that
in this case the following supereld relation holds [1]

r(r+1) m = 1

2 (a) (a

bc)12 12 fbc ,

(4.1)

where

fab = aab  bab + [aa, ab] ,

is now the curvature of the supereld aa. together with (3.3), one hence
obtains recurrence relations which completely determine m in terms of its
lowest components  the physical elds xa and . the eld content associ-
ated with kym hence precisely coincides with the ten-dimensional yang-mills
multiplet.

with the integrable (2.19) and the reduced integrable constraint (2.20)
the situation becomes essentially more complex. in particular, there will be
more supereld components left undetermined by the recurrent relations, i.e.
the spectrum of states turns out to be considerably larger. in this section we
analyze the physical eld content associated with these integrable supereld
constraints kir and ki.

according to the general discussion above, the independent components
k , i.e. by the intersection of

in the supercurl m are given by the space m+
the kernels of (s +r) and k. we start from (3.29)

dim m+

k = dim m+  dim m + dim m
 ,

(4.2)

and will in the following determine the r.h.s. of this equation for kir and ki.
to this end we rst describe the decomposition of superelds into irreducible
representations of so(2, 1).

4.1 decomposition into so(2, 1) representations

the integrable constraints (3.22), (3.23) are still invariant under the action of
so(2, 1) corresponding to the second factor in so(9, 1)  so(2, 1) so(7).
this provides a convenient way to organize the spectrum. explicitly, this
group acts on the supercurl as given in (a.3). the generators are pairwise
adjoint with respect to the scalar product dened in (3.17)

ad
0 = 0 ,

ad
1 = 1 .

19

the supercurl m may hence be decomposed according to the spin of
so(2, 1). we label the total so(2, 1) spin by  and its z-component (i.e. the
eigenvalue of 0 which is raised resp. lowered by ) by 0. according to the
action of 0, the value of 0 is given by the dierence of barred and unbarred
indices in a supereld m,1...p. specically, m[p]

0 is spanned by vectors

m,1...k1,1...l+1
m,1...k,1...l
m,1...k+1,1...l1

,

with p = k + l ,

0 = 1

2 (l  k) , (4.3)

and the spin  states are generated by highest weight states at 0 =  obtained
from (4.3) by modding out the action of +, i.e. satisfying

m =


m,1...k2[1,2...l+2] = 0
km,1...k1[1,2...l+1] = m,1...k1,1...l+1

(4.4)

(k+1) m,1...k[1,2...l] = m,1...k,1...l + m,1...k,1...l

furthermore, the space m[p] may be decomposed according to the action
of the symmetric group on the p+2 spinor indices. this is most conveniently
described in terms of young diagrams, where we use the standard notation
[a1, . . . , an] to describe the young diagram with n rows of length a1, . . . , an.
by [a1, . . . , an] we denote the conjugated young diagram consisting of n
columns of length a1, . . . , an. each box of the young diagrams now represents
a 8 of so(7). the relations (4.3), (4.4) then imply

m[p]

6=0 = [2] (cid:16)[l1, k+1] + [l, k] + [l+1, k1](cid:17) + [1, 1]  [l, k] ,

m[p]

=0 = [2]  [k+1, k1] + [1, 1]  [k, k] .

(4.5)

since the decomposition (3.9) of m[p] has been dened purely in terms of
permuting the spinor indices, it commutes with the action of the symmetric
group. the young diagram decomposition of the eigenspaces m+ and m
may be obtained from (3.10) by analyzing the decomposition of the young
diagrams under 16 7 8+8. specically, we nd

m+

6=0 = [l+1, k+1] + [l, k+2] + [l, k+1, 1] + [l+2, k] + [l+1, k, 1] ,

m+

=0 = [k+2, k] + [k+1, k, 1] .

(4.6)

20

in particular, this gives the dimension

dim m+ [p]

=0 = (cid:18) 8

k(cid:19)
k+1(cid:19)(cid:18) 9

17k + 7

(k + 1)(k + 2)

.

4.2 the reduced integrable constraint

here, we analyze the eld content associated with the reduced integrable con-
straint kir, given by (3.23). this constraint may be equivalently rewritten
as

kirm = 0 = kirm , kirm =

(4.7)

1

2(cid:16)m  m(cid:17) ,

and hence commutes with the action of the symmetric group on the 8 spinor
indices (in contrast to kym and ki). this fact allows to completely resolve
this case without any explicit reference to the decomposition of the supereld
into irreducible representations of so(7) or so(9, 1), respectively.

according to (4.2) we have to determine the spaces m and m

. we
start with m = k irm. according to (4.7) and (4.4), the spin  sector of
m is given by the vectors satisfying



m,1...k2[1,2...l+2] = 0
km,1...k1[1,2...l+1] = m,1...k1,1...l+1

(k+1) m,1...k[1,2...l] = 2m,1...k,1...l

(4.8)

in other words, each vector is given by its part m, satisfying the constraint

m,1...k2[123,4...l+2] = 0 ,

the other parts of m are determined from this by (4.8). this gives the young
diagram decomposition of k ir m:

k ir m6=0 = 2  [l+1, k, 1] + 2  [l, k+1, 1] + [l+2, k] + [l, k+2]

(4.9)

+ [l1, k+1, 1, 1] + [l+1, k1, 1, 1] + [l+2, k1, 1]

+ [l1, k+2, 1] + [l+1, k+1] + [l, k, 1, 1] ,

k ir m=0 = [k+1, k, 1] + [k+2, k] + [k+1, k1, 1, 1] + [k+2, k1, 2] .

21

it remains to determine m

, the space of common eigenvectors of s and
k ir. for this, we consider the operator sir  k irsk ir whose action on
m is found from (3.5) and (4.8) to be:

(sir m [p]),1...k+1,1...l1 = 2(l1) m [p]

1,1...k+1,2...l1

(4.10)

 (k+1) m [p]

1,2...k+1,1...l1

+ (k+1)(l1) m [p]

1,12...k+1,2...l1

.

the operator sir obviously does not commute with its ancestor s and cor-
respondingly has eigenvalues which do not necessarily coincide with those of
s. however, since k ir is an orthogonal projector, it follows that the eigen-
values of sir lie in the interval [p, 2]. moreover, eigenvectors of sir with
eigenvalues p and 2, respectively, are necessarily also eigenvectors of s. di-
agonalizing the action (4.10), sir nally may be decomposed into projectors
p[...] onto the young diagrams from (4.9), respectively:

sir = 2(cid:16)p[l1,k+1,1,1] + p[l+1,k1,1,1] + p[l,k,1,1] + p[l+2,k1,1](cid:17)
+ 2(cid:16)p[l1,k+2,1] + p[l+1,k,1] + p[l,k+1,1](cid:17) + (2k) p[l+2,k]

+ (1l) p[l,k+2]  k+2l

2 p[l,k+1,1] + 2kl

2 p[l+1,k+1]  2k+l1

2 p[l+1,k,1] ,

(4.11)

for l > k ,

sir = 2(cid:16)p[k+1,k1,1,1] + p[k+2,k1,1](cid:17) + (2k) p[k+2,k] + 13k

for l = k .

2 p[k+1,k,1] ,

the eigenspaces with eigenvalue 2 in this decomposition span the space m
.
putting (4.6), (4.9), and (4.11) together, we nd from (4.2)

dimm+

k = 

dim([l+2]) =(cid:0) 8
l+2(cid:1)

0

for k = 0

otherwise

.

(4.12)

the exceptional role of k = 0 stems from the fact that for this value the
eigenvalue of the corresponding young diagram [l+2, k] in (4.11) takes the
extremal values 2 such that at k = 0 this eigenspace becomes part of m
.

22

with (4.2) we hence have obtained the entire physical eld content in the
supereld m induced by the reduced integrable superspace constraint kir.
we collect the result in the following table, organized by level p and so(2, 1)
spin :



p = 0
p = 1
p = 2

the total number of states is 769 = 384+384+1, where 384+384 corresponds
to 3 copies of the irreducible o-shell multiplet (128 + 128) of [3] and the
singlet captures the remaining bosonic gauge freedom. this counting is the
rst hint, that the eld content of the reduced integrable constraint remains
completely o-shell, a fact that we shall show in the next chapters.

4.3 the integrable constraint

here, we analyze the eld content associated with the integrable constraint
ki, given by (3.22). comparing to the result (4.13) for the stronger constraint
kir, even more elds must appear in this case. note that in this section mk
and m refer to the decomposition (3.20) with respect to ki. nevertheless,
it is k i m = k ir m. to make use of the result of the previous section, we
rewrite (4.2) as
dim m+

k = dim m+  dim m + dim m

(4.14)



= (cid:16)dim m+  dim (k irm)+(cid:17) + dim (k irm)+

k .

where the term in the brackets on the r.h.s. has been determined in (4.12)
above and (k irm)+

k is dened to be the intersection of
(k irm)+  (sir2) k irm ,

and (k irm)k  k irkim .

23

this space hence contains the elds that enlarge the spectrum with respect
to (4.13). its dimension remains to be computed.

we rst consider the case l = k, i.e. the so(2, 1) singlets. the space
k then is generated by vectors v = v1 + v2 such that v1 and v2 are
2 (13k), respectively  cf.

(k irm)+
eigenvectors of sir with eigenvalues (2k) and 1
(4.11) , which in particular satisfy

kisir v = kisirki v = 1

4 (k2) v .

(4.15)

the second equality is obtained from contracting (4.10) over . since ki is
an orthogonal projector, comparing (4.15) to the eigenvalues of sir shows,
that it can be satised only if

for p = 4 one may show by a similar but slightly more complicated analysis
of the operator (kisir kisir ki), that (k irm)+

we leave details to the reader. at p = 2, in contrast, it is k irm = (k irm)+
and hence dim (k irm)+

k = dim (k irkim) = 7+21.

the total number of elds in this case is 816 = 416 + 400.

5 recurrent relations.

having determined the eld content, we will derive the recurrent relations
which explicitly determine the higher level supereld components in terms

24

of the lower level components. for simplicity, we restrict for the rest of the
paper to purely bosonic congurations, e.g. we set all fermionic elds to zero.
this is just for the sake of clarity, the techniques may likewise be applied
to determine the structure of the fermionic elds and eld equations.
in
particular, supersymmetry is unbroken up to this point.

for the strong supereld constraint, the supereld m is entirely de-
termined by its zero level components which are the physical yang-mills
elds. the recurrent relations which determine the higher supereld levels
have been given in (4.1). with the integrable constraints (2.19), (2.20) the
picture becomes more complicated. in view of the eld content (4.13) and
(4.17), a huge amount of additional elds has to be introduced to eventually
obtain closed recurrence relations which replace (4.1).

to keep things tractable, we will most of the time restrict the analysis
to those elds which transform as singlets under the so(2, 1) symmetry
underlying (2.23). despite this technical restriction, the method described
in the following allows straight-forward although more tedious generalization
to the higher spin elds.

5.1 the reduced integrable constraint

in the spin zero sector the eld content associated with kir according to
(4.13) contains an antisymmetric tensor eld in addition to the seven dimen-
sional yang-mills vector eld. we have shown that in principle all higher
levels p > 0 of m are uniquely determined in terms of these elds.

to make this dependence explicit, we start from the system (3.25)

(s + p) m [p] =  p+2

p t m [p2] + c[p] .

(5.1)

contracting this equation with kir, we obtain

(kirskir + pkir) m [p] =  p+2

p kirt m [p2] + kirc[p] .

(5.2)

recall, that the space m=0 decomposes into

k ir m = [k+1, k, 1] + [k+2, k] + [k+1, k1, 1, 1] + [k+2, k1, 2]

kir m = [k+1, k, 1] + [k+2, k] + [k, k, 2]

together with the eigenvalue decomposition (4.6) of s this gives the eigenval-
ues of the operator (kirskir) at each level p, which are 2,  p
4(6  p).

2 , and 1

25

this allows to eectively invert the system (5.2) to obtain

m [p] = [p] t m [p2]  p

p+2 [p] c[p] ,

(5.3)

with [p] = n 8

3p2(p+2) (kirskir)2 + 2(p+14)

3p2(p+2) (kirskir)  3p2+10p+24

3p2(p+2) kiro .

thus, we have completely resolved this sector with an explicit recurrent de-
nition of all higher level components of the supereld m. in a similar way,
one may obtain the dening relations for the higher so(2, 1) spin sectors.

as an illustration, we evaluate the lowest two bosonic levels of the super-
curl m. they are determined by the level zero elds: the seven dimensional
yang-mills vector eld xi and an antisymmetric tensor eld bij:

5.2 the integrable constraint

for the reduced integrable kir constraint, we have given the complete recur-
rent solution (5.3). since the integrable constraint ki is weaker in the sense

26

of (3.24), its eld content is larger and the recurrent relations will involve
more elds. from (4.17) we know already that the spectrum associated with
ki in its spin 0 sector contains another copy of the vector and tensor elds.

the system (5.1) in this case gives rise to the recurrent relations

p+2 [p]s + io kik irn [p] , (5.7)

n =  n
n =  n
n =  n

(5.8)

where [p] has been dened in (5.3) above, and n is a supereld which
satises:

m [p] = [p](cid:16)t m [p2]  p
p+2 c[p](cid:17) +n p
n = kik ir n = n =

with a scalar supereld n, further constrained by (4.4). taking dierent
projections of (5.1) one may obtain the remaining recurrent relations which
determine the higher levels of these scalar superelds in terms of the lower
levels in m and n. these however becomes more tedious due to the fact
that the integrable constraint can no longer be expressed entirely in terms of
permuting spinor indices.

here, we restrict to giving the rst two levels of n which have the partic-

ularly simple form

n[0] = 0

(5.9)

n[2] = i

summarizing, we have shown that in the sector of so(2, 1) singlets, the
supercurl m in recursion gauge and with the integrable superspace con-
straint (3.22) imposed, is determined in all orders by the set of physical
elds

xi , bij , zi , cij ,

(5.11)

which enter as components at the levels p = 0 and p = 2 of the supereld
expansion of m as given in (5.10). in the following, we will study what
kind of dynamical relations we may in addition extract for these elds.

since ki is the weakest of the three constraints we are studying, the other
two cases may be embedded as particular truncations of (5.10). it is easy to
see that they correspond to

kym : cij = yij , zi = 0 , bij = 0 ,

(5.12)

kir : cij = 0 , zi = 0 .

6 field equations.

in this section we will determine the eld equations implied by the integrable
constraints ki, kir for the physical elds. as in the previous chapter we

28

restrict to the dimensionally reduced situation where all elds depend only
on the coordinates xi, i = 1, . . . , 7, thereby consistently truncating the system
to singlets under so(2, 1).

the eld content in this sector is given by (5.11) for ki, kir implies
the further truncation (5.12). following the general discussion of section
3, the dynamical content arises from projecting the image of the operator
t according to (3.28) onto the space m
. applying this to the integrable
constraints, we nd that kir in fact does not imply any eld equation on
the elds xi, bij, such that the corresponding spectrum remains completely
o-shell. the weaker constraint ki which has a larger spectrum, will give
rise to rst order dynamical equations for the additional elds zi and cij,
coupled to the o-shell elds xi and bij.

let us rst recapitulate the case of the strong constraint. at level p = 2
the supercurl is uniquely determined by the yang-mills elds according to
the lowest order component of equation (4.1)

m [2]

 = (a) (a

bc)12 12 ybc .

since there are no new elds arising on this level, relation (3.29) yields

m+

k =  = dim m

 = dim m  dim m+ ,

(6.1)

(6.2)

where the numbers on the r.h.s. may be extracted from the representation ta-
bles collected in appendix c. in particular, this shows that no eld equations
arise on this level.

at level p = 4, equation (6.2) with table (c.4) shows that m

 is nonempty
but contains e.g. the vector representation 10 of so(9, 1). according to
(3.28) the dynamical equation is given by the scalar product

dm



[4]

10(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) (cid:16)t m [2]

k  2

3c[4](cid:17) ,

with t m [2]

k  b yab

(6.3)

since this is the nondegenerate scalar product on a space of multiplicity
k given by (6.1)) to indeed

one, it suces to show that t m [2]
k
obtain the bosonic part of the yang-mills eld equations

6= 0 (with m [2]

db yab = 0 .

(6.4)

one might expect to nd further relations in the so(9, 1) representations
120 and 126, respectively, in which according to (c.4) the space m
 also

29

has nonvanishing contributions. however, the rst one contains precisely the
bianchi identities of yab which are automatically satised, whereas there is
no nontrivial image of t into the 126 as one may easily verify. thus, in
agreement with [1], there arise no further restrictions than the yang-mills
equations of motion (6.4), here.

in the following, we repeat this analysis for the integrable constraints ki

and kir.

6.1 the reduced integrable constraint

for the reduced integrable constraint kir, the entire constraint is encoded in
the system (5.1) of which we have already solved the projection (5.2) by im-
posing the recurrent relations (5.3). it remains to study the complementary
projection:

k ir (s + p) m [p] =  p+2

p k ir t m [p2] + k ir c[p] .

(6.5)

plugging in the explicit solution (5.3), one obtains after some calculation

k ir (2s + (p4)) k ir (4s + (3p2)) k ir (cid:16)t m [p2]  p

(6.6)
this encodes the entire dynamics of this constraint. comparing (6.6)
with (4.11), one recognizes (3.28); the operator on the l.h.s. of this equation
is precisely the projector onto m
.

p+2 c[p](cid:17) = 0 .

however, it turns out (as we have explicitly checked for p  6 and are
condent that it holds on all levels) that equation (6.6) becomes an identity
when m [p2] is expressed by the recurrent relation (5.3). hence, we conclude
that for the reduced integrable constraint, the system (5.1) is solved by (5.3)
without imposing any further relations on the physical elds. the system
remains completely o-shell.

6.2 the integrable constraint

let us turn to the integrable constraint ki. recall, that this is a weaker
constraint than kir and hence gives rise to a larger spectrum. likewise,
the dynamical equations implied by this constraint must be compatible with
the truncation (5.12) since the system associated with kir was completely
o-shell.
in other words, setting zi = 0 = cij must solve all dynamical
equations without imposing further dynamics on xi, bij.

30

as we have shown above, at the level p = 2 of the supercurl m we
nd new elds arising, the explicit formulae have been given in (5.10). from
table (c.3) we nd that m 
 is empty at this level, i.e. there are no eld
equations arising at p = 2, the projection (3.28) turns out to be satised
without imposing any restrictions on the level zero elds.

at level p = 4, we expect some dynamical equations to appear in analogy
with (6.3) for the strong constraint. we discuss the dierent irreducible
representations of so(7), starting with the singlet 1. according to (c.5), this
appears in a particularly simple way, namely with multiplicity one. moreover,
the table shows that

mult m


[4]
1 = 1 ,

i.e. according to (3.28), a dynamical equation arises from the scalar product

dm



[4]

1 (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) (cid:0)t m [2]  2

3 c[4](cid:1) ,

similarly to (6.3), this scalar product is particularly simple to compute be-
cause it lives on a space m[4]
1 of multiplicity one. with the explicit expression
from (5.10) we arrive at the rst eld equation for the enlarged system

with m [2] given by (5.10) .

dizi = 4

3 (cid:2)cij, bij(cid:3) .

(6.7)

note, that this equation has no analogue in the original yang-mills system
since in that system there is no combination of elds and derivatives trans-
forming as singlet of so(9, 1) at this order.

let us continue with the vector part 7 which should contain the analogue
of the yang-mills equations of motion. for illustration, we will describe this
sector in some detail. according to the general proceeding outlined above,
we rst determine the subspace m
 which by projection gives rise to the
dynamical equations of the system.
it follows from (c.5) and (6.2) that
[4]
m
7 is nonempty with multiplicity one. to determine this space explicitly,

[4]
it suces to diagonalize the operator s from (3.5) on the space m
7 . a
basis of the latter is e.g. given by

(w1)i

the dynamical equations are nally obtained according to (3.28) by project-
ing the image of m [2]

explicit computation gives the following result

(6.10)

this gives the analogue of the yang-mills equations for the enlarged system
associated to the integrable dynamical constraint. for the strong constraint
kym this equation according to (5.12) consistently reproduces the yang-mills
equations of motion. moreover, it is compatible with the absence of dynamics
in the truncation to the reduced integrable constraint kir.

similarly, one may continue with all the other so(7) subrepresentations
contained in m. as is clear from the above proceeding, the existence of
a dynamical equation rst requires the corresponding subspace m
 to be
nonempty and in addition a nontrivial projection (3.28) of the image of t .
whereas validity of the rst criterion may simply be extracted from the
tables collected in appendix c, the second condition requires a more careful
calculation and has been done on the computer using mathematica.

we give the result for this level in linearized order, where the complete

set of dynamical equations is given by

mzm = 0 ,

mcmi = 0 ,

[i cjk] = 0 .

(6.11)

the full nonlinear extensions of the rst two equations have been given in
(6.7), (6.10) above; likewise, the third equation acquires nonlinear contribu-
tions, such that the eld cij does not satisfy the pure bianchi identities of

32

a covariant eld strength. the linearized equations however are sucient to
extract the propagating degrees of freedom contained in zi and cij. e.g. one
of the main results of (6.11) is the absence of an equation in the antisymmet-
ric 21 for [izj] (although the space m
 21 is nonempty, the projection (3.28)
has trivial image). whereas cij hence carries the dynamics of a propagating
vector eld, the role of zi remains somewhat unclear.

we close this section with a remark on the dynamical equations for the
higher so(2, 1) spin elds at this level. since the elds appearing in the
spectrum of kir (4.13) remain o-shell, the only dynamical equations of
higher spin can appear for the (3, 1) elds of level p = 0 from (4.17). these
elds are part of the original yang-mills vector eld, as such their dynamical
equation is expected in the (3, 1) at level p = 4. however, according to (6.2)
[4]
and (c.5) the space m 
(3,1) is empty, such that there is no analogue of this

part of the original yang-mills equations of motion. the equations (6.11)
hence contain the complete dynamical content at this level.

the task of studying the higher supereld levels which might induce
higher order equations for the elds zi and cij is left for future work. a
strong consistency check for the arising equations is provided by their com-
patibility with the dierent truncations (5.12) to the yang-mills and the
o-shell system, respectively.

7 summary

in this paper we have analyzed the eld content and the dynamical equa-
tions induced by certain modications of the constraint of vanishing super
curvature which is equivalent to ten dimensional supersymmetric yang-mills
theory. the geometric origin of the modied constraints is a truncation of
the ten-dimensional linear system, breaking the original lorentz symmetry
so(9, 1) down to so(2, 1)  so(7). the lax representation thereby re-
duces to a system with scalar spectral parameter (2.23) which bears strong
similarity with the lax connection for selfdual four-dimensional yang-mills
theory.

applying the general formalism of section 3, two dierent scenarios have
been revealed for the integrable and the reduced integrable constraint ki and
kir, respectively. the latter induces a spectrum of (384 + 384) elds (4.13)
thereby drastically reducing the eld content (3.16) of the unconstrained
supercurl but still remaining completely o-shell.

33

the integrable constraint ki gives rise to additional (31 + 16) elds which
are strongly restricted by rst order dierential equations which in linearized
form have been given in (6.11). the complete spectrum of so(2, 1) singlets
thus involves two pairs of elds (xi, zi and bij, cij) with the same tensorial
structure, but with dierent dimensions, since xi, bij, and zi, cij have di-
mensions one and two, respectively. the elds xi and bij do not obey any
equations of motion whereas cij and zi appear with dynamical equations
coupled to the o-shell elds. according to (6.11), cij contains the degrees
of freedom of a propagating vector eld xi, whereas zi apparently is asso-
ciated with an o-shell two-form bij. hence, we nd an intriguing duality
with the original elds xi, bij which remains to be explored in more detail.
if we reduce to four dimensions, there is a striking analogy with the case
of electromagnetism in the presence of magnetic charge (see e.g. ref.[21]),
where the eld strength is build from two pieces, a homogeneous one such
that the bianchi identity gives zero, and another piece for which the bianchi
identity gives the magnetic current. thus, we conclude that our dynamics in
general involves magnetic charges. on the other hand, the eld bij has the
features of a two-form vector potential. an intriguing question is the role of
the corresponding gauge transformations bij  bij + d[ij] + . . .. however,
the form of possible interactions with higher form gauge potentials appears
to be highly restricted on general grounds (see [13] for a recent discussion).
we leave all these questions to future studies.

another point we have omitted so far, is the dynamics of the fermionic
elds of the theory which may be analyzed with exactly the same methods
that have been presented here for the bosonic sector. in particular, the (pos-
sibly broken) supersymmetry should help to better understand the nature of
the underlying physical system.

in view of the geometric origin of the integrable constraints, a natu-
ral problem is the generalization of the present approach by studying more
general reductions of the original linear system (2.21). here, we have ana-
lyzed the dynamical systems associated with the particular truncation (2.22)
to a one-parameter set of light-like rays whose spatial part spans a two-
dimensional plane. truncation to more general subvarieties may rene the
dynamics. allowing for a more general dependence of the linear system on
the vector vi bears some striking similarities with the harmonic superspace
approach to four-dimensional n = 2 supersymmetric yang-mills theory [6].

34

we nally mention the possibility to recover in this framework and upon
dimensional reduction some of the classical higher spin gauge theories, which
have been constructed by vasiliev (see e.g. [18] for a review) and recently
[16] been brought into the context of a possible m-theoretic origin.

appendix

a reduction of -matrices.

in this appendix we collect our conventions of so(9, 1) -matrices and their
decomposition into so(8)  matrices. we use the following particular real-
ization:

088

188 (cid:19) ,
(cid:16)(cid:0)9(cid:1)(cid:17) = (cid:16)(cid:0)9(cid:1)(cid:17) = (cid:18) 188 088
088 188 (cid:19) ,
(cid:16)(cid:0)0(cid:1)(cid:17) = (cid:16)(cid:0)0(cid:1)(cid:17) =(cid:18) 188 088
(cid:16)(cid:0)i(cid:1)(cid:17) = (cid:16)(cid:0)i(cid:1)(cid:17) =(cid:18)

i = 1, . . . 8 ,

ij t + ji t = 2ij,

i, j = 1, . . . , 8.

(a.2)

our index convention here is as follows: greek letters from the beginning
of the alphabet run from 1 to 16, letters from the middle of the alphabet
from 1 to 8, denoting the two spinor representations of so(8). choosing

35

a particular eight-dimensional vector vi breaks so(8) down to so(7) and
provides a mapping between the two spinor representations by ~v
.
for notational convenience we put vi = i
 = , such that   
denotes an so(7) covariant involution. it then follows from the dirac algebra
(a.2) that the matrices i, i = 1, . . . , 7 are antisymmetric.
in the main
text, unless otherwise stated, roman indices i, j, . . . from the middle of the
alphabet exclusively denote the coordinates 1, . . . , 7.

to make the so(2, 1) covariance of the decomposition (a.1) manifest, we
dene the action of the generators k, k = 1, 0, 1 on the supercurl m as:

b the o(9, 1) characters.

in this appendix, we compute the characters of the reducible representations
which appear in section 3. the path followed is similar to the calculation of
string characters of ref.[5], and we shall refer to that paper for details. in

general, the o(9, 1) characters are dened as (~v) = tr (cid:0)epi vihi(cid:1), where

vi are arbitrary parameters, where the trace is taken in the representation
considered, and hi, i = 1, . . . , 5 are a set of ve commuting elements of the
lie algebra. using a parametrization analogous to the one used in ref.[5]
for o(8) spinors, one easily sees for instance that the character of the 16
representation7 is given by

16(~v) = x1 ,,5=1

introduce in general characters of the type (~v|q) = tr (cid:0)qrep i vihi(cid:1). then

concerning the  part, one works in an occupation number basis where
n =  is simultaneously diagonal for  = 1,    , 16. since the lie
group generators commute with the grading operator r, it is convenient to

the calculations becomes identical to a part of the string calculation, where
the role of r is played by the virasoro generator l0. altogether, one nds

dim m+ = 16(cid:0)217  1(cid:1)  17(cid:0)216  1(cid:1) = 983041

it would be interesting to derive the characters +
 which determine
the physical eld content, and the set of eld equations. this is much harder,
since ki and kir break o(9, 1) invariance. it is left for further studies.

(8  8)s  (8  8  . . .  8)a  (8  8  . . .  8)a ,

etc. ;

to obtain the multiplicities of m one needs in addition the decomposition
of the young diagrams (3.10). this has been done with the help of lie [17].

at level p = 4 we nd with the strong constraint (2.15) the following

multiplicities of the lowest dimensional so(9, 1) representations
