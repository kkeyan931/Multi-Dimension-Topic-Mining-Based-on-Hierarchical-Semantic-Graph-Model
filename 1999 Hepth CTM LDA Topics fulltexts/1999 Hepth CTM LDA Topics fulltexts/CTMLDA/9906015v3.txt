abstract

in a nonrelativistic contact four-fermion model we show that simple regularisation pre-
scriptions together with a denite ne-tuning of the cut-o-parameter dependence of bare
quantities give the exact solutions for the two-particle sector and goldstone modes. their
correspondence with the self-adjoint extension into pontryagin space is established leading
to self-adjoint semi-bounded hamiltonians in three-particle sectors as well. renormalized
faddeev equations for the bound states with fredholm properties are obtained and anal-
ysed.

introduction

models with four-fermion interactions arise in a wide range of problems both in quantum eld
theory and condensed matter physics [1]. four-fermion contact interaction models also shed light
on the low-energy hadronization regime of qcd where the perturbative approach fails. they
are used as qualitative and quantitative descriptions of various phenomenological data in hadron
physics. the non-perturbative nature of the bound states in both hadron and condensed matter
physics challenges numerous eorts to develop non-perturbative methods, which particularly
aim at an explicit non-perturbative solution of the corresponding theoretical model [2].

the success of four-fermion models originates, rstly, from the fact that these models embody
chiral symmetry and its spontaneous breaking [3]. it is well known, however, that such models are
nonrenormalizable within conventional perturbation theory. calculations around four-fermion
models face ultraviolet divergencies. these divergences are treated, as a rule, by introducing
an ultraviolet cut-o  indicating the range of validity of the model. the mathematical reason
of the divergences partially become apparent in the framework of extension theory. the very
singular interactions in such models cannot be considered as a correct quantum-mechanical
potential. therefore, every n particle fock state has to be studied within the prescriptions of
extension theory.
the nonrelativistic contact four-fermion models are particularly interesting, because in these
frameworks they possess a family of the exact analytical three-dimensional solutions in the one-

and two-particle sectors. these solutions, for example, can be considered as a basis to study the
mechanism of bosonization and condensation in hartree-fock approximation.

it should be stressed that a vector current-current contact term leads to a generalized point
two-particle interaction which, in the modern extension theory, appears simultaneously as a local
and separable nite-rank perturbation containing a nite set of arbitrary extension parameters
with clear physical meaning. thus, in contrast to some popular belief, the contact eld interac-
tion promises to become physically even richer and more predictive than the usual (non-local)
separable one.

the nonrelativistic limit of the contact four-fermion model was developed in our previous
articles [4], [5]. there it was demonstrated that such contact quantum eld models possess
exact two-particle solutions. we claried the mathematical origin of the model divergences
and gave a simple prescription how to treat them nonperturbatively. to this end a functional
dependence of all bare quantities on a cut-o  was assumed. next, this functional dependence
was determined by means of the limiting procedure relating the nite observables and innite
bare quantities at    in one-particle and two-particle fock states. in the present paper
the investigation of our model is continued in order to include the three-particle sector as well.
it will be elucidated, how the vacuum, one-particle, and two-particle renormalized fock states
completely dene the three-particle ones, demonstrating self-consistency of our renormalization
prescription, whose mathematical basis is provided by the extension theory.

the paper is organized as follows. in section 2 the operator diagonalization of the initial
hamiltonian is described. in section 3 and in appendix a the underlying singular two-particle
problem is reviewed. sections 4, 5, and 6 contain our main analysis of three-particle equations
with some details placed in appendix b. one can trace the long history of the development of
singular two- and three-particle problems in the recent articles [6] (and references therein). we
would like to notice here that our consideration follows the idea of refs. [7], [8], and especially
[9], but we use another possibility to regularize the instantaneous (anti) commutation relations
with the same regularization as for the interaction.

let us consider the following four-fermion hamiltonian

here e(k) is arbitrary bare one-particle spectrum, v  has the meaning of an excitation volume
and can be expressed through the usual momentum cut-o parameter . the hamiltonian is

denitions are conditional. for example, one can nd the interaction structure (1) with the usual
j -spin, as a direct nonrelativistic limit of the relativistic four-fermion combination (aa)2 +
(a a)2, neglecting the magnetization current  (cid:16)a

j(x), i.e. eliminating usual spin-orbit and spin-spin interactions. this elimination is coordinated
with our subsequent consideration.

in contrast to variational solutions with uava 6= 0, usually exploring in the theory of supercon-
ductivity. the dierent realizations correspond to dierent systems when v1,2 independently
take the values 0,1. for convenience we call them a,b,c systems.
for the b-system: v1 = v2 = 0, b(k) = d1
b (k).
one can see that the respective vacuum state | 0ib is a singlet for both the suj (2) and sut (2)
groups and the one-particle excitations of b and eb form the corresponding fundamental repre-
sentations.
for the c-system: v1 = v2 = 1,  c(k) = d1
symmetry of this system is similar to the symmetry of the b-system.
for the a-system: v1 = 0, v2 = 1 (or v1 = 1, v2 = 0); it will be considered in detail below. let
(k), and let f ab be an arbitrary constant sut (2) matrix, then
a(k) = d1

a (k) the corresponding heisenberg elds (5) read (hereafter we
write | 0i | 0ia):

it is easy to show that for this a system the symmetries sut (2) and u (1) turn out to be

the quantities jn() and dp () are dened in appendix a by eqs. (81) and (88). the galilei
invariance of this solution is restored only due to the limit    in the same manner as for the
goldstone states above. we notice from eqs. (7), (30), an (33) that there is no direct relation
between the character of the point interaction and the sign of the quartic contact self-interaction
in eq. (1). one can always choose for a given g() the -dependence of the bare parameters
m() and e0() to leave the m() and e0() nite for   . on the contrary g() is
determined by the two-particle eigenvalue problem. so, the last equality in eq. (37) reects
condition for the existence of the bound state dened by eqs. (88) and (89), which serves here as
a dimension transmutation condition [7], [8] transforming the bare coupling constants 0 and
0 of eq. (24) and the cut-o  into unknown binding and scattering dimensional parameters
b and  [5]. in this way, these real quantities become arbitrary parameters of the self-adjoint
extension and some of them are expressed through the coecients of the formal -series (35)
of bare quantities (33) by the ne-tuning relations (37). within these relations the nite
one-particle spectra for qq-channels take the following forms (the index columns in the l.h.s.
being in direct correspondence with the terms on the r.h.s.)

as 1{}  0, a non zero solution, similar to eqs. (26), (27), (29), and (30) (without the
restriction (32)), appears only if one discriminates the terms of subsequent order of formally
the same divergences <<k2>> in eq. (7) and <<[k2]>> in eq. (81). these divergences originate
from regularizations of the anticommutator (4) in the one-particle spectrum and the two-particle
interaction kernel (15), respectively. their dierence reecting their dierent physical nature
may be easily treated as a xed shift of the cut-o   +/3, manifesting itself in <<[k2]>> 
<<k2>> +  and in eq. (37). however, such a shift makes the above goldstone solution (22) to
break down at any nite  even for p = 0. thus, the existence of the bound (and scattering)
states in the aea-channel and in the aa- or eaea-channel, as well as the goldstone mode imply the
mutually exclusive conditions of ne tuning (36), (37), (38), and (39). that is why in appendix
a we trace the further fate of the goldstone states and the derivation of the solution (30) in the
framework of extension theory by means of the procedure which, in a certain sense, is equivalent
to the divergence manipulations of such kind.

really, a simple normalization test for the scattering solutions (29) and (30) shows the
necessity of at least one additional discrete q-depended component for the wave function, with
a positive or negative metric contribution according to the sign of . so, strictly speaking,
we deal with a self-adjoint extension of the initial free hamiltonian, which is restricted on the
appropriate subspace of l2, onto the extended hilbert (or pontryagin) space l2  c 1 [11], [12].
however, this additional discrete component of the eigenfunctions only corrects their scalar
product. it is completely dened by the same parameters of the self-adjoint extension but does
not aect the physical meaning of the obtained solution in ordinary space [10]-[14]. besides,
it would be inappropriate to associate this additional components with the additional set of
creation-annihilation operators [11] (see appendix a).

another extension appears for the choice of nite bare mass that is true only for the b-
system and for (a)-case of the a-system. thus g0,1 = 0,1 = 0, and eqs. (33) and (34), together
with the condition (89), lead to the solution coinciding with the well-known extension in l2 [7]
of the singular operator from eq. (25) with 0  0, for which:

the kernel (45) obviously reproduces all permutation symmetries and guarantees for momentum
conservation. therefore, it seems convenient to simplify the separation of the spin-symmetry
structure from the coordinate wave function for p 6= 0 by using formal functions of three
dependent variables, like d(p,j,m)
(q1q2q3) of eq. (43), introducing suitable form factors
(further on e(k) = eq(k)  e{+}(k)):

for nite  one easily recognizes the interiors of the square brackets in the kernels of these
equations as the exact o-shell extensions (85) of the corresponding half-o-shell two-particle
t-matrices from the l.h.s. of eqs. (30) and (31). however, the renormalized versions of these
o-shell t-matrices also coincide with the respective on-shell ones, given by the r.h.s of eqs.
(30) and (31) (see appendix a). so, one observes, when   , the restoration of the galilei
invariance, as in the two-particle case [5], and comes to further simplications cx,y,z = bx,y =
0. they lead to one and the same renormalized equation for the only function of only one

here we replaced in the denitions (88) and (60) the inverse propagator from eq. (61) by the
one from eq. (65) omitting the term (p  q, s)/m vanished with   , what results in the
substitution for 2(q) of eq. (61):

2(p)  e2(p) = fm0(cid:16)eeea0 + 2eea0  fm3(p)(cid:17).

keeping in mind the conditions (89), (37) and (39), one nds the same limit (64) for the
renormalized s-wave kernel of the rst of the eqs. (73) and (74) at   . however, for the
rst of eq.(72), as well as for all p-wave kernels above and here, the limit is zero under these
conditions. so, c1,2,3(q) = q1(q; p) = 0, and eqs. (73) and (74) degenerate into a system for
the functions of only one variable q2,3(q; 2r)) = a2,3(q). that means a3(q) = a2(q)  a(q),
returning us virtually to the previous eq. (63) for a(q)  a(q) with  = 1. this equation
coincides with the shondins equation for three-bosonic case up to a multiplicative constant /2
[11]. as shown in refs. [11] and [6], the asymptotic behavior of our separable o-shell t-matrix
(64) provides that we deal with a self-adjoint three-particle hamiltonian semi-bounded from
below in both cases. however, the hamiltonians related to more slowly vanishing t-matrices
for other two-particle extensions (41) are unbounded, manifesting the collapse in the three-
particle system under consideration.

the absence of any vector parameters for p = 0 implies that a(q)  a(q) for zero total

angular momentum [15] and eq. (63) is reduced as follows:

q a(q) = t ((q))

6 conclusions

let us summarize the main points of our considerations. we picked out from the various eld
operator realizations of the singular hamiltonian (1) with rich internal symmetry the only real-
ization with spontaneous symmetry breaking. then, we revealed the denite -dependence of
the bare mass and the coupling constant keeping the galilei invariance of the corresponding
exact simple goldstone solutions. this dependence, in turn, together with a natural subtrac-
tion procedure, xed the self-adjoint extensions of the hamiltonian in the one- and two-particle
sectors; the latter determined the well-dened three-particle hamiltonian.

so, in ref. [5] and here we have formulated an unambiguous renormalization procedure ex-
tracting renormalized dynamics from a nonrenormalizable contact four-fermion interaction.
this procedure is self-consistent in every n -particle sector. it is closely connected with the con-
struction of the self-adjoint extension of the corresponding quantum-mechanical hamiltonians
and with the restoration of galilei invariance.

m0, e()

it has been shown that the simple -cut-o and the natural subtraction prescriptions with
the denite  dependences of bare quantities xed by ne-tuning relations reduce the eld
hamiltonian (1) into a family of self-adjoint semi-bounded hamiltonians in one-, two-, and
three-particle sectors. the above exact solutions, correctly dened for scattering and bound
states, as well as for the goldstone mode, contain a nite set of arbitrary extension parameters
a0 , b,  with clear physical meaning for all two-particle channels of the a,b,c-systems.
thus, the developed renormalization procedure may be considered as a direct generalization
to strongly singular point interactions of the berezin-faddeev procedure [7], [16]. from the
point of view of quantum eld theory it gives an example of a nonperturbative renormalization
for the four-fermion interaction. it is interesting to note that the initial two-particle operator
(25) is the same as the one of diejen and tip [14]. at the same time, shondins [11] and
fewsters [12] hamiltonians may be considered as the various possible renormalized versions of
our renormalized operator dened by eqs. (110) and (111).

the renormalization procedure with the -cut-o prescription and ne-tuning relations on
the one hand, and extension theory on the other hand, maintain the same s-wave two-particle
solutions (30) and (64) from the various points thus supplementing each other. nevertheless, the
additional physical conditions are necessary to make a choice among the various mathematical
possibilities. e.g., to have a nite spectra for both particles and antiparticles together with three-

particle bound state it is necessary to consider the eaaa-channel with a two-particle bound state
in the eaa-channel only, i.e. the case 0 = 3/5.
it is worth to note that, identifying a (ea) as a constituent light u and d quark (anti-
quark) with the constituent mass mn /3  m/2  m0 = 385 mev, one nds from eq. (22)
for the goldstone mass mg = (2/5)m0 = 154 mev, which is close to the pion mass m = 140
mev. at the same time, the spinless  and  mesons with the mass m are the nearest
two-particle bound states with the appropriate quantum numbers l = 0 and j=1,0 [19], what
implies   b  0. so, the parameter  is sucient to reproduce the nucleon mass mn for
the solutions (76) and (119) with k = 1, whereas the solutions with k > 1 describe qualitatively
the nucleon p11resonances [20].

here it is shown how the extension theory maintains the solution (30). according to the general
[14], self-adjoint extensions of any
shondin construction [13] developed for our case in ref.
operator of type (25) are generated as extensions of the laplace operator h0 = 2
x from the
subspace of h0 = l2 hj|i = 0 xed by functionals hk|ji = j(k)  hj, 1(k) = 1, 2(k) =
k2 into pontryagin space of type h0  c 1  c 1 with a restriction onto a positively dened
subspace. the resolvents of all such self-adjoint extensions are contained in the closure (in the
pontryagin space) of kreins formula for the resolvent associated with our rank-2 perturbation

(37), and (39). the generalized solution (22),pv (2)3 hx|1i = v  3(x), is still the exact
wave function of the goldstone states (19) for p = 0 at nite m and  as well. however, its
contribution (90) into the resolvent disappears as    for arbitrary . thus, for  6= 0, the
described procedure gives in fact the limit of bt(z) of eq. (86) only, like the procedure in ref.
[11].
kreins formula for a resolvent of an extended operator is essentially the second identity
(79), where, by denition, the arbitrary nite constant hermitian matrix k1 has nothing to
do with the bare matrix k1
in eq. (80). to make it meaningful, as a rst step, the pre-
pontryagin space is constructed by adding to the h0-subspace the generalized defect elements:
|i = |1i + c0|(0)
1 i + c1|(1)
i = (r0())jn |ji  hn,
j  1  n  0, j = 1, 2, where . . .  h1  h0  h1  . . . is a subscale [14] of the usual sobolev
scale [16] and  = 2 < 0 is an arbitrary subtraction point. in a next step, the prescription for
their scalar products is introduced, which for divergent cases m + n > 0 are equated to elements
of an arbitrary hermitian matrix. our denition of them incorporates also berezins recipe [9]
with arbitrary (m+n)

for the scattering eigenstate which follows from eqs. (83) and (84) in pre-pontrygin space the
generalized defect elements are combined into the vector |1i = |(1)
1 i, regenerating
by this way the goldstone degree of freedom. thus, the function hx|1i = (2)3/23(x) is
playing a dual role: as a generalized goldstone state eigenfunction in the -cut-o approach or
as a total defect component of scattering (and bound) eigenstates in the extended space of
the extension theory. for the nal pontryagin space 1
1 one can associate again the goldstone
degree of freedom with the additional eigenvector |1
i of eq. (111), identifying its eigevalue
from eq. (90) for  = 0, with the use of eq. (40) for nonrelativistic p:
2 7 b2
and in that case it is incorporated into the physical hilbert space.

 p 2 > 0. note that this state is positively dened only for  < 0
the point is that the goldstone state, considered as a bound state with zero binding energy
and zero angular momentum, is forbidden as a usual square-integrable solution of the quantum-
mechanical schrodinger equation with a short-range potential. that is why the purely quantum-
eld degree of freedom disguises as an additional discrete dimension of the extended space.

2 cosh(  )  1(cid:19) ;

cosh  t ( cosh  ) .

(113)

here, w (cosh  ) is an even function of  and  is a suitable positive constant introduced for
convenience. note that the last kernel has additional eigenfunctions with opposite (even) parity.
according to general restrictions from the two- and three-particle scattering problems [18],
a presence of two-particle bound state  = b implies that  > b  0. therefore, if  + 2b > 0,
the function t ((q)) from eq. (64) is nite and tends to zero fast enough to make the following

19

( ) = ( ) =

this is obviously true for arbitrary t ((q)) with the above properties and transforms eq. (113)

therefore, operator bo has only positive nonzero eigenvalues and the nite trace trhboi = 2 ln 3.

at last, the simple explicit expressions follow for both  () and ( ) from eq. (114) at

b = 0, ( > 0), for  = coth ,  = / cosh :

e () =

e( ) =

and similarly for () and (). this allows a direct application of faddeevs consideration [18]
to eq. (115) when   0,   . thus, cosh(  )  cosh(  ), and the seeking of the

(119)

a numerical solution of eq. (115) shows that this asymptotic behaviour in fact starts from the
ground state k = 1 for the interesting odd solutions f2k(), corresponding to integer k > 0. more
exactly, for k = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 one has eq. (119) with k  (k + )/0 and   0.06006 (fig.1).
the last value gives also the upper bound of remaining fourier-coecients |bn6=k| (fig.2) of the
