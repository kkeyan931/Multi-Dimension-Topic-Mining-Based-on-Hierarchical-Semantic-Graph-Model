abstract

we study the action of picture-changing and spectral ow operators on a ground ring of ghost
number zero operators in the chiral brst cohomology of the closed n =2 string and describe an
innite set of symmetry charges acting on physical states. the transformations of physical string
states are compared with symmetries of self-dual gravity which is the eective eld theory of the
closed n =2 string. we derive all innitesimal symmetries of the self-dual gravity equations in
2+2 dimensional spacetime and introduce an innite hierarchy of commuting ows on the moduli
space of self-dual metrics. the dependence on moduli parameters can be recovered by solving the
equations of the sdg hierarchy associated with an innite set of abelian symmetries generated
recursively from translations. these non-local abelian symmetries are shown to coincide with the
hidden abelian string symmetries responsible for the vanishing of most scattering amplitudes.
therefore, n =2 string theory predicts not only self-dual gravity but also the sdg hierarchy.

introduction

the pioneering work of ooguri and vafa [1] revealed an intimate connection between self-dual
eld theories and (classical) n =2 string theories, formulated in four spacetime dimensions.
in
particular, four-dimensional manifolds with a metric g of ultrahyperbolic signature (+ + ) and
a self-dual riemann tensor arise as exact (to all orders in ) classical background congurations
for the closed n =2 string.
indeed, the only physical string degree of freedom in this case is a
massless scalar eld whose (tree-level) dynamics takes the form of plebanskis rst [1] or second [2]
equation, which both describe self-dual gravity (sdg) [3], albeit in dierent gauges. although the
absence of an innite tower of massive excitations indicates a sort of caricature of a string, this
quality makes it amenable to exact solutions, a fact quite rare in string theory. yet n =2 strings
may not only serve as a testing ground for certain issues in string theory in general but, being
consistent quantum theories, they can also serve as a guide in the quantization of self-dual gravity.

the self-duality equations for the riemann tensor can be considered on complex four-manifolds
m c with holomorphic metric gc, and in most papers on sdg just the complex case was considered.
in order to investigate the symmetries of the sdg equations, one usually xes some special form of
a tetrad, which corresponds to the choice of a gauge. this choice breaks the invariance of the sdg
equations under the gauge group sdi(m c) of volume-preserving dieomorphisms of a manifold
m c. using dierent gauges, various symmetries of the sdg equations were uncovered (see e.g. [4, 5,
6] and references therein). it is fair to say, however, that the connections between these symmetries
have not yet been claried. also missing is a discussion of the symmetry subalgebras compatible
with a real structure on m c, i.e.
symmetry algebras of the sdg equations on riemannian or
kleinian four-dimensional manifolds with signature (4, 0) or (2, 2), respectively. again, the rst
steps in this direction have been made by ooguri and vafa [1].

we notice that the description of self-duality depends on the orientation of the manifold m , and
self-duality can be replaced by anti-self-duality upon changing the orientation of m . this paper
will be concerned with the sdg equations. we shall describe the sdg equations on kleinian four-
dimensional manifolds m of signature (2,2) and discuss their integrability, hidden symmetries, and
hierarchies. no complete treatment of these problems yet exists. we shall also discuss a connection
between the group-theoretic and the geometric twistor approaches to the symmetries of the sdg
equations, describe a general solution of the linearized sdg equations, and therefore present all
innitesimal symmetries of these equations.

if n =2 string theory predicts self-dual gravity, its wealth of symmetries should be obtainable
from the stringy description. more precisely, we expect the sdg hierarchy related to the abelian
symmetries of the sdg equations to be visible in n =2 closed string quantum mechanics. indeed, in
an earlier paper with junemann [7], the authors have recently identied part of these hidden string
symmetries and have demonstrated that they are the cause of the vanishing of almost all scattering
amplitudes. quite surprisingly, the stringy root of such symmetries is technically the somewhat
obscure picture phenomenon [8] which is present whenever covariant quantization meets worldsheet
supersymmetry. global symmetries unbroken by the string background under consideration may
be classied with the help of brst cohomology, and the latter unexpectedly displays a picture
dependence [9] (see also [10]). this connection hints at a geometrical interpretation of the picture
phenomenon of the closed n =2 string in terms of ows in the moduli space of self-dual metrics.

2 review of the closed n=2 string

from the worldsheet point of view, critical closed n =2 strings in at kleinian space r2,2 are a
theory of n =(2, 2) supergravity (h, , a) in 1+1 dimensions coupled to two chiral n =(2, 2) massless
matter multiplets (y, ). the latters components are complex scalars (the four string coordinates)
and so(1, 1) dirac spinors (their four nsr partners). the n =2 string lagrangian, as rst written
down by brink and schwarz [11], reads

l = hn 1

2 hmnm y

anya + i

2

 am



dm +a + am  am+a

+ (m y

a +  a+

m) 

n mn+a +  anm+

n (mya + 

m+a)o  aa

(2.1)

where hmn and am, with m=0, 1, are the (real) worldsheet metric and u (1) gauge connection,
respectively. the worldsheet gravitino m as well as the matter elds ya and a are complex
valued, so that the spacetime index a, a = 1, 2 runs over two values only. complex conjugation
reads

a
(ya) = y

(2.2)
and  aa = diag(+) is the at metric in c1,1. as usual, {m} are a set of so(1, 1) worldsheet
gamma matrices,  = 0, and dm denotes the worldsheet gravitationally covariant derivative.

m ,

but

(+a) =  a and (+

m) = 

this formulation entails the choice of a complex structure on kleinian space. a given complex

structure breaks the global lorentz invariance of r2,2,

spin(2, 2) = su (1, 1)  su (1, 1)  u (1)  su (1, 1)  u (1, 1)

.

(2.3)

the moduli space of complex structures is the two-sheeted hyperboloid h 2 = h 2
 with
h 2
  su (1, 1)/u (1). it can be completed to cp 1 by sewing the two sheets together along a circle,
(2.4)

cp 1 = h 2

+  h 2

+  s1  h 2

 .

instead of using complex coordinates adapted to su (1, 1), one may alternatively choose a basis

appropriate for sl(2, r) and employ a real notation for the string coordinates,

y1 = x1 + ix2

,

y2 = x3 + ix4

,

(2.5)

by expressing the real coordinates x, , , . . . = 1, 2, 3, 4, in sl(2, r)  sl(2, r) spinor notation,

x . =  .

 x = (cid:18) x4+x2 x1x3

x1+x3 x4x2 (cid:19) ,

  {+,} ,

.

.

.  {

+,

} ,

(2.6)

with the help of chiral gamma matrices  appropriate for the spacetime metric  = diag(++).
in the real formulation, the tangent space at any point of r2,2 can be split to r2  r2 which
denes a real polarization or cotangent structure. such a polarization is characterized by a pair of
null planes r2, and the latter are determined by a real null two-form modulo scale or, equivalently,
by a real sl(2, r) spinor v modulo scale. indeed, each null vector (u .) factorizes into two real
0(cid:1), it becomes clear that a given

null plane is stable under the action of

v(cid:1) = (cid:0)t
spinors, u . = vw .. choosing coordinates such that (cid:0)v+
0 a1(cid:19) (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)
with b+ := n(cid:18) a b

b+  sl(2, r)

a  r, b  ro ,

(2.7)

,

2

where b+ acts on v and sl(2, r) on w. the moduli space of cotangent structures thus becomes

spin(2, 2)/[b+  sl(2, r)]  sl(2, r)/b+  s1

(2.8)

which in fact is just the s1 in (2.4). however, it turns out [12] that the real spinor v also encodes
the two string couplings,

v(cid:19) = 1/4(cid:18)cos 
(cid:18)v+
2(cid:19)

2
sin 

(2.9)

with   r+ being the gravitational coupling and   s1 the instanton angle. since v (including
scale) is inert only under the parabolic subgroup of b+ obtained by putting a=1, the space of string
couplings is that of nonzero real sl(2, r) spinors,

r+  s1  r2  {0}  c  {0}  1/4 ei/2

.

(2.10)

consequently, xing the values of the string couplings amounts to breaking the global lorentz
invariance of r2,2 in a way dierent from (2.3),

spin(2, 2) = sl(2, r)  sl(2, r)  r  sl(2, r)

,

(2.11)

where r  b+(a=1) from eq.(2.7).

the n =2 supergravity multiplet denes a gravitini and a maxwell bundle over the worldsheet
riemann surface. the topology of the total space is labeled by the euler number  of the punctured
riemann surface and the rst chern number (instanton number) m of the maxwell bundle. it is
notationally convenient to replace the euler number by the spin

j := 2 = 2n  4 + 4(#handles)  2z .

(2.12)

the lagrangian is to be integrated over the string worldsheet of a given topology. the rst-
quantized string path integral for the n-point function a(n) includes a sum over worldsheet topolo-
gies (j, m ), weighted with appropriate powers in the string couplings (, ei):

a(n) =



xj=2n4

j/2 a(n)

j =



+j

xj=2n4

xm =j

j/2 eim  a(n)
j,m

(2.13)

where the instanton sum has a nite range because bundles with |m|>j do not contribute. the
presence of maxwell instantons breaks the explicit u (1) factor in (2.3) but the su (1, 1) factor (and
thus the whole spin(2, 2)) is fully restored if we let 1/4(ei/2, ei/2) transform as an su (1, 1)
spinor. the partial amplitudes a(n)
j,m are integrals over the metric, gravitini, and maxwell moduli
spaces. the integrands may be obtained as correlation functions of vertex operators in the n =(2, 2)
superconformal eld theory on the worldsheet surface of xed shape (moduli) and topology.

the vertex operators generate from the (rst-quantized) vacuum state the asymptotic string
states in the scattering amplitude under consideration. they uniquely correspond to the physical
states of the n =2 closed string and carry their quantum numbers. the physical subspace of the
n =2 string fock space in a covariant quantization scheme turns out to be surprisingly small [13]:
only the ground state |ki remains, a scalar on the massless level, i.e. for center-of-mass momen-
k aka = 0. the dynamics of this string excitation is described by a
tum ka with k  k :=  aa
massless scalar eld,

(y) = z d4k ei(ky+ky) (k)

amplitudes,

interestingly, it has been shown [1, 14] that all tree-level n-point functions vanish on-shell, except
for the two- and three-point amplitudes,

since we argue that the string couplings (, ei) can be changed at will by global lorentz
transformations, it is admissible to make a convenient choice of lorentz frame. first, we may scale
  1 (i.e. put the constant dilaton to zero). second, the instanton angle  is at our disposal. in
the real notation, renaming   , one sees that taking =0 reduces the amplitude to its m =+j
contribution [2],

and is called plebanskis rst equation. it also describes 2+2 self-dual gravity but in a dierent
parametrization. in particular, the metric of a self-dual spacetime is ricci-at and kahler, with a
kahler potential

(y, y) = a a ya y

a + (y, y)

,

(2.25)

where  must satisfy the second-order equation (2.24).

the lagrangian may be generalized to curved kleinian space [15] by introducing a kahlerian
metric background (plus a constant dilaton and axion). the one-loop beta function equations then
demand the kahler metric to be ricci-at, implying again a self-dual riemann tensor [16]. the
deviation from at r2,2 may therefore be parametrized either by a nontrivial weyl tensor expressed
in  or by the perturbation  of the at kahler potential, in accordance with the string dynamics.
we learn that the arbitrariness of the lorentz frame for the n =2 string implies the equivalence
of dierent descriptions of self-dual gravity, in particular the equivalence of plebanskis rst and
second equations as a matter of gauge choice. for the remainder of this paper, we will mainly use
plebanskis rst equation, corresponding to complex string variables, adapted to su (1, 1) notation.
we conclude that, at tree-level, the n =2 closed string is indeed identical to self-dual gravity.

3 self-dual gravity

3.1 self-dual gravity equations

let m be an oriented four-manifold of class c with a nondegenerate metric g of signature
(+ + ) and a volume element . having the metric g, one can introduce the levi-civita
connection , the riemann tensor r and the ricci tensor ric. if u is an open subset of m and
x : u  r4 are (local) coordinates on u , , , ... = 1, ..., 4, then these objects have components
g = (g ),  = (
 ), and the volume element  has the form

 ), ric = (r ) = (r

), r = (r

 =

1

4!pdet g 1...4dx1  ...  dx4 ,

where 1...4 is a skew-symmetric symbol with 1234 = 1.

let us consider the following equations on a metric g = (g ):

22
11r

22 = r

 r = r

(3.1)
2
11 := det g g2g211. a metric g satisfying
where  is the hodge star operator and 22
eqs.(3.1) is called a self-dual (sd) or left-at metric [17, 18, 19, 20, 21]. it is easy to see that sd
metrics are ricci-at, i.e. they satisfy einsteins vacuum eld equations. notice that the denition
of self-duality will be replaced by the denition of anti-self-duality if we change the orientation of
the manifold m , e.g. from local coordinates (x1, x2, x3, x4) on u we go over to (x1, x2, x3,x4).

11,

5

equations (3.1) can be rewritten in a simpler form of equations on divergence-free vector elds.
namely, let  be a volume form on an oriented 4-manifold m . then for a vector eld  on m a
divergence of  is dened by

l = (div),

where l is the lie derivative along . thus, divergence-free is a synonym for volume-
preserving, and we shall consider the algebra sdi (m ) of volume-preserving vector elds on m .
now, let us take four pointwise linearly independent vector elds t  sdi (m ) and suppose they
satisfy the self-duality equations

(3.2)

where 22

11
(lorentz) indices. let f be a scalar function dened by f 2 = 4!(t1, t2, t3, t4), where {t} is a
solution of eqs.(3.2). then one may dene a tetrad e and a (contravariant) metric g1 by formulae

e := f 1t  e

 = f 1t 
 ,

g1 := f 2tt  g = f 2t 

 t 
 ,

(3.3)

(3.4)

and the metric (3.4) will be sd. conversely, every sd metric arises in this way, and eqs.(3.2) are
equivalent to eqs.(3.1). for detailed proofs and references see e.g. [22].

we call eqs.(3.2) the self-dual gravity (sdg) equations. they are invariant under the transfor-

mations

(3.5)
where  is any divergence-free vector eld on m , i.e.   sdi (m ). for discussion of lorentz
transformations see [6]. equations (3.2) may be interpreted as the self-dual yang-mills equations
for yang-mills elds with the gauge group sdi(m ) of volume-preserving transformations of (m, )
(see [22] and references therein).

(t3  it4), w1 :=

2

(t1 + it2), w2 :=

2

(t3 + it4),

(3.6)

i.e. w1, w2, w1, w2  sdic(m ) = sdi(m )  c. then eqs.(3.2) may be rewritten in the form

[w1, w2] = 0,

[w1, w1]  [w2, w2] = 0,

[w1, w2] = 0.

(3.7)

(3.8)

(3.9)

we see that eqs.(3.7) and (3.9) have the form of zero commutator conditions. notice that
{wa, w a} are null vector elds since

11 := (w1, w1) = 1, 22 := (w2, w2) = 1,

(wa, wb) = (w a, w b) = (w1, w2) = (w2, w1) = 0,

6

where a, b, ... = 1, 2, a, b, ... = 1, 2.

we have dened complex vector elds (3.6) so that w a = wa. notice that eqs.(3.7) and (3.9)
are invariant w.r.t. transformations from the complexication sdic(m ) of the group sdi(m ).
we shall consider transformations from sdic(m ) such that after their action we shall have w a 6=
wa but the metric will be real. these complex transformations may be used for the partial xing of
a coordinate system. namely, one can always introduce complex coordinates ya, y a := (ya) = y a
on u  m so that w1 and w2 become coordinate derivatives (frobenius theorem), i.e.

w a =  a :=


y a

,

and eq.(3.7) is identically satised. then one can solve eq.(3.8) by choosing a gauge

w1 = 122  221 , w2 = 112  211 ,

(3.10)

(3.11)

where (ya, y a) is a real-valued scalar function, a := /ya. substituting (3.11) into eq.(3.9),
we obtain the rst plebanski equation

1221  1122 = 1.

(3.12)

thus, the sdg equations (3.7)-(3.9) can be reduced to one equation (3.12) on a scalar function 
which coincides with eq.(2.24) with =1 after shifting  by formula (2.25).

we introduce the antisymmetric -symbols,

12 = 21 = 
1 = 1
by using (3.13), eqs. (3.10)  (3.12) can be rewritten in the form

12 = 21 = 12 = 21 = 1,

(3.13)

(3.14)

(3.15)

the vector elds (3.14) are divergence-free with respect to the volume form  = dy1  dy2 

dy1  dy2 and coincide with a tetrad because f = 1. dual basis of {wa, w a} has the form

1 = 1adya, 2 = 2adya, 

a = dy

a.

the above choice of coordinates, a tetrad and a dual tetrad is convenient because the metric g in
this gauge takes the kahler form

g = a ba

b = 2a bdyady

b

(3.16)

with the kahler potential .

3.3 linear systems for the sdg equations

in sect.3.2 it has been shown that the rst plebanski equation (3.12) can be obtained from
the asdg equations (3.7)-(3.9) by xing a gauge. that is why we shall consider lax pairs for

7

equations (3.7)-(3.9), and lax pairs for eq.(3.12) will be obtained by substituting the tetrad (3.14).
for the sake of simplicity we shall consider real analytic solutions of eqs.(3.7)-(3.9) and (3.12).

equations (3.7)-(3.9) can be obtained as the compatibility conditions of the following linear

system of equations:

+ := a
where  is the complex spectral parameter, and a
and holomorphic in  for || < 1, a, b, ... = 1, 2, 3 . indeed, the compatibility conditions

+ := (w1  w2)a
+ := (w2  w1)a

(3.17)

l+
2 a

+ = 0,

+ = 0,

[l+

a ,l+

b ] = 0

(3.18)

of eqs.(3.17) are identical to the sdg equations (3.7)-(3.9).

for the same equations (3.7)-(3.9) one can write another linear system

l
1 a
l
2 a

 := (1w1  w2)a
 := (1w2  w1)a
l
3 a

where || > 0 and functions a
the compatibility conditions

(3.19)
(x, ) are smooth in x  u , ||  1 and holomorphic in  for || > 1.
(3.20)

[l

a ,l

b ] = 0

of eqs.(3.19) are identical to the sdg equations (3.7)-(3.9).

the auxiliary spectral parameter  in the linear systems (3.17) and (3.19) is connected with
the group su (1, 1). this group acts on the sphere s2  cp 1, and the riemann sphere decomposes
into the disjoint union
(3.21)

s2 = h 2

+  s1  h 2



of orbits of su (1, 1), where

h 2 := h 2

+  h 2



is the two-sheeted hyperboloid, h 2
+  su (1, 1)/u (1) is the upper half of the hyperboloid and
h 2
  su (1, 1)/u (1) is the lower half of the hyperboloid. using the stereographic projection, one

3.4 twistors, complex structures and the sdg equations

let us consider a bundle z  m of complex structures over a 4-manifold m . following ref. [18],
we shall call z a twistor space of m . since we are interested in local geometry of the manifold m ,
we shall consider the restriction of the twistor bundle z  m to an open subset u  m and put
p := z|u .

recall that on any oriented sd manifold m there exists a family of complex structures covari-
antly constant w.r.t. the levi-civita connection, and they are parametrized by the two-sheeted
hyperboloid h 2 described in sect.3.3, where

h 2
+  so(2, 2)/u (1, 1)  su (1, 1)/u (1)  sl(2, r)/so(2),
h 2
  so(2, 2)/u (1, 1)  su (1, 1)/u (1)  sl(2, r)/so(2)

are two orbits of the group so(2, 2) acting on complex structures j  so(2, 2). therefore, in our
case the twistor space p of u coincides, as a smooth manifold, with the direct product

i.e. p is the disjoin union of p+ = u  h 2

p  u  h 2 = (u  h 2

+)  (u  h 2
) = p+  p,
+ and p = u  h 2
.

the vector elds l+

a from the linear system (3.17) span the (0,1) tangent space of p+, and the
vector elds l
a from (3.19) span the (0,1) tangent space of p. the compatibility conditions of
these linear systems are the integrability conditions of an almost complex structure on the twistor
space p. from the other hand, these conditions are equivalent to the condition of self-duality of
the metric g on u  m , which is the reformulation to the ultrahyperbolic case of the well-known
twistor correspondence between sd geometry of u and complex geometry of p [17, 18]. notice
that if an almost complex structure on p is integrable, then a
 may be taken as complex analytic
coordinates on p  p. moreover, from (3.17) and (3.19) it is clear that one may always take
+(x, ) = , 3
3

(x, ) = 1.

the space

is the s1 bundle over u of real anti-self-dual null bivectors l0

2, modulo scale, where

p0 = u  s1

l0
1 = w1  w2, l0
  s1. put another way, p0 is a set of pairs (x,l0

1  l0
2 = 1w2  w1,
1(x)  l0

2(x)), where x  u , and

(3.23)

1  l0
l0

2 = 1w1  w2 + (w1  w1  w2  w2)  w1  w2

is an anti-self-dual null bivector at this point, parametrized by   s1. if we introduce the spaces

p+ := u  h 2
+,

p := u  h 2
,

then p0 = p+  p and our linear systems (3.17), (3.19) are dened on the subsets p+, p of the
space

p := p+  p0  p  u  s2.

the space p0 = p+  p is the common domain of the coordinates a

+ and a

. therefore there

exist smooth functions f a

(3.24)

+ such that on p0 we have
+(b

a
+ = f a

).

9

on the space p one can introduce a map  : p  p called a real structure. it is an antiholomorphic
involution, dened by the formula

 (1(x, ), 2(x, ), 3(x, )) = (1(x, 1), 2(x, 1), 3(x, 1)),

(3.25)

where a(x, ) are local coordinates on p, x = x. this involution takes the complex structure on
p to its conjugate. we may choose the coordinates a
 =  (1

 on p in such a way that
+), 3

1
 =  (2

 =  (3

+), 2

(3.26)

+).

considering these conditions on p0 and substituting them into (3.24), we obtain the reality condi-
tions on functions a
.

there are xed points of the action of  on p, and they form a three-dimensional real manifold
called a real twistor space t (u ) of u . in the at case this manifold coincides with the projective
space rp 3 [23, 15]. the space p0 is bred over t (u ) by real 2-manifolds called -surfaces, and the
vector elds (3.23) span their tangent spaces. coordinates on the real twistor space t (u ) may be
introduced in the following way. consider three functions a
0(x, ) on p0 which are real analytic for
x  u ,  = exp(i)  s1. so they extend holomorphically in  to a neighbourhood u0 of u  s1
in p = u  s2. then consider linear dierential equations
1a
l0
0 = (w1  w2)a
l0
2a
0 = (1w2  w1)a

(3.28)
where l0
a are vector elds on p0 dened by formulae (3.23). the compatibility conditions of the
linear system (3.27), (3.28) are identical to the sdg equations. therefore eqs.(3.27), (3.28) always
have solutions if {wa, w a} satisfy eqs.(3.7)-(3.9). moreover, one may always take 3
0 =  and
impose on 1

0 the reality condition such that

0 = 0,

0 = 0,

(3.27)

0, 2

0(x, ) = 2

0(x, ).

such functions (1

of u  s1 are holomorphic coordinates on u0 satisfying the reality conditions

0, exp(i)) may be considered as coordinates on real twistor
0 to a neighbourhood u0

0) = (1

0, 3

0, 1

0(x, 1) = 2
1

0(x, ),

which are reduced to the condition (3.29) on p0.

to sum up, by virtue of the twistor correspondence all the information about a sd metric on
u is encoded in a complex structure of the twistor space p of u , which is dened by the linear
systems (3.17), (3.19) and complex coordinates a
. from the other hand, according to the kodaira-
spencer deformation theory, all the information about the complex structure of p can be extracted
from the transition functions f a
+ on p0. but for preserving readability we shall not develop this
correspondence further.

3.5 the second plebanski equation

to describe the second plebanski equation, it is necessary to go to a real null tetrad {xa, x a}

on u  m, a, b, ... = 1, 2, a, b, ... = 1, 2. for this we set

 =

i  
i + 

(3.30)

in eqs.(3.17) and (3.19). the transformation (3.30) is a linear-fractional transformation of the
complex plane that carries the unit disk || < 1 to the upper half-plane im > 0, the domain
|| > 1 to the lower half-plane im < 0 and the circle || = 1 to the real axis im = 0. the metric
on h 2 in the coordinates ,  takes the form

ds2 = 

4dd
(  )2

.

(3.31)

this is a metric of kleins model of lobachevskii geometry. it is invariant under the action of the
group sl(2, r) and singular when im = 0 (real axis).

it is easy to show that after the above transformation  7 , eqs.(3.17) may be rewritten as

1

(i + )

(x1  x2)a

+ = 0,

1

(i + )

(x2  x1)a

+ = 0, a

+ = 0,

(3.32)

are null vector elds since

(x1, x1) = (x2, x2) = 1, (xa, xb) = (x a, x b) = (x1, x2) = (x2, x1) = 0.

(3.33)

analogously, eqs.(3.19) may be rewritten in the form

1

(i  )

(x1  x2)a

 = 0,

1

(i  )

(x2  x1)a

(3.34)

+ = 3

(1

+(x, ), 2

+(x, ), 3

+(x, )) = (2

(x, ), 1

(x, ), 3

(x, )).

the compatibility conditions of each of the linear systems (3.32) and (3.34) are reduced to the

equations

[x1, x2] = 0,

[x1, x1]  [x2, x2] = 0,

(3.35)

(3.36)

(3.37)
which are the sdg equations (3.2) rewritten in terms of real divergence-free vector elds {xa, x a}.
again, as in the case of complex divergence-free vector elds, two equations from eqs.(3.35)-(3.37)

[x1, x2] = 0,

11

has the form of zero commutator conditions and one can choose real coordinates such that {xa}
or {x a} coincide with coordinate derivatives. then for two remaining vector elds one can choose
a parametrization such that eq.(3.36) will be identically satised, and the sdg equations will be
reduced to one equation on a scalar function.

let us choose real coordinates (za, z a) so that

xa = a :=


za ,

and take vector elds {x a} in the form

x1 = 212  221, x2 = 112  121,

(3.38)

(3.39)

where  = (za, z a) is a real-valued scalar function and  a := /z a. then eq.(3.36) is identically
satised, and eq.(3.37) is reduced to the rst plebanski equation

in the real null coordinates (za, z a).

1221  1122 = 1

using the same coordinates (za, z a), instead of (3.38), (3.39) one can choose the following

tetrad:

xa = a, x1 = 1 + 122  2

21, x2 = 2 + 2

1 2  121 .

(3.40)

then eqs.(3.35), (3.36) are identically satised, and eq.(3.37) is reduced to the second plebanski
equation

11  22 + 1212  2

1 2

2 = 0

(3.41)

on a real-valued scalar function (za, z a). this equation coincides with eq.(2.20) after introducing
the coupling constant  by changing   .

the vector elds (3.38), (3.39), (3.40) are divergence-free with respect to the volume form

 = dz1  dz2  dz1  dz2 and dual basis of the tetrad (3.40) has the form

1 = dz1 + 12dz2 + 2

remark. the plebanski equations are special cases of the sdg equations appeared after the
gauge xing and solving two equations from eqs.(3.2). the rst plebanski equation is an analogue
of the sd yang-mills equations in the so-called yang gauge, and the second plebanski equation is
an analogue of the sd yang-mills equations in the so-called leznov gauge.

4 symmetries of self-dual gravity

4.1 symmetries of the sdg equations from the twistor viewpoint

we consider the sdg equations (3.7)-(3.9). the linearization of these equations has the form

[w1, w2] + [w1, w2] = 0,

[w1, w2] + [w1, w2] = 0,

[w1, w1] + [w1, w1]  [w2, w2]  [w2, w2] = 0.

choose a gauge in which 0

transformations (4.9) of the vector elds l

and (4.8).

it is not dicult to verify that if vector elds  and  on p0 satisfy eqs.(4.10), then the vector
eld [, ] will also satisfy eqs.(4.10) by virtue of the jacobi identities. therefore, the space of
vector elds satisfying eqs.(4.10) forms an algebra with the standard commutator of vector elds.
these vector elds can be considered as representatives of free vector elds on the real twistor
space t (u ) of u . notice that to impose reality conditions on symmetries of equations (3.7)-(3.9)
and (4.2), (4.3) it is necessary to know reality conditions for vectors from a tetrad {wa, w a}. for
example, if w a = wa, then on vector elds  from formulae (4.11)-(4.13) one can impose the
following reality conditions:

+(x, ) = (x, 1)  n

+ = n
,

where n = 0, 1, ... . then we shall have w a = wa.

suppose that not only the vector eld , but also the vector elds  from (4.11)-(4.13) satisfy

eqs.(4.10), i.e.

[,l+

a] = 0.

(4.15)

then from formulae (4.6), (4.7) and (4.9) we see that for such  the symmetry transformations
are trivial, wa = w a = 0. vector elds + and  satisfying eqs.(4.15) are in a one-to-one
correspondence with holomorphic vector elds on p+ and p, respectively. indeed, l+
a are vector
elds of type (0,1) on p+ (see sect.3.4) and therefore have the form

remark. the quotient space of the space of solutions  to eqs.(4.10) by the subspace of
solutions  to eqs.(4.15) can be described in terms of sheaf cohomology groups and kodaira-
spencer deformation theory. for discussion in euclidean signature and references see [24].

4.2 transformations of tetrads on self-dual manifolds

the explicit form of the transformations of a (conformal) sd tetrad {wa, w a} on u  m can
easily be obtained from formulae (4.4)-(4.13). namely, let us choose any solution  of eqs.(4.10)

15

 = (x)  sdi(m ) to p. they have the form  =  + (x, ), where (x, ) are
quadratic in . for the vector elds  we have (x) := 0
 and from formula (4.18)-(4.21)
we obtain

+ = 0

wa = [, wa],

w a = [, w a].

(4.22)

the transformations (4.22) coincide with the transformations (3.5) generated by the group sdi(m )
of volume-preserving dieomorphisms of (m, ).

to see a connection with the previous recursion descriptions of symmetries of the sdg equa-

tions on complex 4-manifolds we consider a vector eld   sdic(m ) such that

0
w a := [, w a] = 0,

0
wa := [, wa] 6= 0.

then we choose a solution  of eqs.(4.10) on p0 such that

where 0

[w2, n+1

n
 wa := [wa, n

(4.25)

(4.26)

then eqs.(4.25) and formulae (4.26) exactly reproduce the symmetries of the sdg equations known
before (see [6] and references therein).

the transformations (4.26) can be obtained from formulae (4.18)-(4.21). namely, notice that if

 satises eqs.(4.10), then for any n  z the vector eld

n

(4.27)

also satises eqs.(4.10). then split the vector eld (4.27) according to formulae (4.11)-(4.13),

and using (4.14) choose the gauge (n)0

n = (n)+  (n),

n = (n)+  (n) = (n+1

then we have

(n)0

 ,

(4.28)

(4.29)

(4.30)

and formulae (4.18)-(4.21) are reduced to formulae (4.26). thus the known symmetries (4.26) of
the sdg equations are generated by the vector elds (4.27) on the space p0  u  s1 by formulae
(4.18)-(4.21). we shall return to a correspondence between the twistor and recursion relations
approaches to the description of symmetries when considering the plebanski equations.

16

4.3 symmetries of the plebanski equations

symmetries of the rst plebanski equation (3.12) can be obtained by substituting the explicit
form (3.10), (3.11) of a tetrad {wa, w a} parametrized by a real function  into formulae (4.10),
(4.11)-(4.13), (4.18)-(4.21) or (4.25), (4.26), (4.27)-(4.30). if we want to preserve the gauge w a =
 a, then we should impose the conditions w a = 0. from the formulae of sect.4.2 it follows that
for this it is sucient to choose always 0
+ = 0 in the splitting (4.11)-(4.13). in particular, let us
consider divergence-free vector elds  = aa satisfying the equations [ a, ] = 0 and generating
the algebra that we denote by sdi c
 = , then by formulae (4.24)-
(4.30) we obtain the well-known lie algebra of symmetries sdi c

2 . then if we put ()0

 = 0

2  c[, 1] (cf. [6]).

notice that symmetries wa are connected by formulae (4.18)-(4.21) with lie derivatives
along local vector elds  on p. having the explicit form of dieomorphism-type transformations
 : wa  wa, one can set up a problem of nding functional transformations  :  7  of
the kahler potential  of a sd metric inducing the same change of wa from (3.14) as under the
action by  on wa. in other words, we want to nd such  that the equations

b
acbb b()c = wa = [0


, wa] = [0

b
acbb bc]
, 

(4.31)

are satised. here we used formulae (3.14) and (4.18)-(4.21).
in general, if we use only the
metric (3.16) and do not use a tetrad {wa, w a}, then we can consider functional transformations
 :  7  by themselves without considering the transformations of a tetrad.

consider the transformation  :  7  and substitute  +  into the plebanski equation
(3.12). leaving terms with  of the power not higher than one (linearization), we see that 
satisfy the ultrahyperbolic wave equation

where we used formulae (3.14) and (3.16). thus, nding all innitesimal symmetries of the rst
plebanski equation is reduced to nding all solutions to the wave equation in a self-dual background.
the general solution of the wave equation on riemannian manifolds with sd conformal structures
was described by hitchin [25] in twistor terms and used by park [5] in discussion of symmetries to
the rst plebanski equation on complex 4-manifolds. in the case of ultrahyperbolic signature (2,2),
the general solution of eq.(4.32) can also be described in twistor terms.

consider real analytic functions 1

0(x, ) =  = exp(i) satisfying
eqs. (3.27), (3.28) on p0 = u  s1. let us act on eqs.(3.27) by the vector eld w1, on eqs.(3.28)
by the vector eld w2 and sum them. taking into account that the vector elds {wa, w a}
have the form (3.10), (3.11) and the function  satises the plebanski equation (3.12), we obtain
that functions a

arbitrary complex-valued smooth function f (1
0 also satises eq.(4.32). as a function
of a

sect.3.4.

where s1 = {  c : || = 1}. substituting the expansion (4.33) into the equations l0
follow from eqs.(3.27), (3.28) we have the recursion relations

af = 0 which

w1f n+1 = w2f n, w2f n+1 = w1f n,

(4.35)

where n  z. using eqs.(4.35), one can nd f n for any n by choosing f 0 as a seed solution.

we call the map

r : f n 7 f n+1

(4.36)

the recursion operator. this operator is not unique because of the ambiguity in the inversion of w1
and w2. moreover, in the absence of boundary conditions, f n is determined only up to the addition
of a function f (ya) + g(y a), where f and g are arbitrary functions of ya and y a, respectively. in
terms of the recursion operator r we have

f n+1 = rf n

(4.37)

and by iterating we obtain f n = rnf 0.

to see a correspondence with the symmetries known before and described e.g.

in [7], let us
consider a complex divergence-free vector eld  = aa satisfying the equations [ a, ] = 0.
substitute 0

 :=  a a as a starting point of the recursion procedure (4.35)-(4.37), we introduce f n

(4.41)

these symmetries form the algebra sdi c

to introduce transformations preserving the reality of the kahler potential, let us consider
0, ) that is real analytic and therefore extendable to a holomorphic function

a function f (1
f (1

0, ) on a neighbourhood u0 of t (u ) in p, where it satises

0(x, 1), 1) = f (1

0(x, 1), 2

f (1

0(x, ), ).

(4.42)

on p0 such a function is real, i.e.

f (1

0, 2

0, ) = f (1

0, 2

0, ),

and by formula (4.34) it gives the general real analytic solution f  of eq.(4.32) since f 0 = f 0.
indeed, in terms of components f n of the expansion of the function f in , the reality conditions
(4.42) have the form

f n = f n.

hence f 0 = f 0 and formula (4.34) gives a real solution of eq.(4.32).

having in mind all the above, let us take as  in formulae (4.40) a vector eld complex conjugate
 =  a a

to the vector eld  from formulae (4.38), (4.39), i.e. choose  = . then starting with f 0
and using eqs.(4.35)-(4.37), one can introduce a function f conjugate to f in a sense that

after this we can introduce symmetries

(4.45)

where we use the metric inverse to the metric (3.42). using further the linear system (3.32) or
(3.34), we can introduce real analytic functions 1
0(x, ) =  on p0,   r  .
from formula (3.30) for  = exp(i) we obtain

0(x, ), 3

0(x, ), 2

by introducing a smooth function f (1

for discussion of this formula in the case of the at space r2,2 see e.g. [23, 15]. one can introduce
symmetries generated by vector elds on u by formulae analogous to (4.38),(4.39), (4.40), (4.41)
and (4.43), (4.44), that we shall not do.

4.4 relationships between sdg symmetries

we shall show here that all symmetries of the sdg equations described in sections 4.1-4.3 are

connected with each other.

in sect.3.4 we mentioned that all information about a sd metric g on u is encoded in transition
+ on the space p0, a = 1, 2, 3. accordingly, innitesimal variations of the sd metric
+ are nothing but

+ of these transition functions. in its turn, f a

functions f a
are encoded in variations f a
components a in the expansion

 = a 
a
+

+ a

in the basis {/a

+, /a

+} of a vector eld  satisfying eqs.(4.10), i.e.

f a

+ = a.

analogously, the holomorphic components a
innitesimal variations

 of vector elds  from formulae (4.11)-(4.13) dene

a

 = a


of the coordinates a

 on p.

+ = , 3

recall that 3
 = 3

 = 1 and in sections 4.1-4.3 we considered transformations such that
 = 0  3 = 0,  = 0. the imposing of these restrictions is connected with the fact

3
that under deformations of the space p the holomorphic projection

must be preserved. the choice of the gauge 3
possible, which is proved in the twistor approach (see e.g. [17, 19]).

 :

p  cp 1
 = 3 =  = 0 satises this condition and is always

(4.46)

notice that on bres of the bundle (4.46) one can dene a closed 2-form , holomorphic on the
space p [17, 19]. in fact, the equations d = 0 are equivalent to the sdg equations [26]. in the
local coordinates a

 on p this 2-form is
| p+ = d1

+  d2

+ | p = d1

  d2
.

on p0 we have

d1

+  d2

+ = d1

0  d2

0 = 2d1

  d2
,

which means the quadratic dependence of | p+ on . in other words,  is a 2-form on p with
values in sections of the holomorphic line bundle o(2)  p (see e.g. [21]). by deforming p one
should preserve  (cf. [17, 19, 21]) and therefore vector elds  satisfying (4.10) have to preserve
not only a volume 4-form  on m , but also the 2-form  on p. consider a neighbourhood u0 of
p0, a basis {/a
0 , where it is taken into
account that 3 = 3 = 0. then we obtain

0} on u0 and expand  = a/a

this means that the vector eld  acts on functions g(a
0 , ) as a hamiltonian vector eld dened
on bres of the bundle (4.46). in (4.47) the hamiltonian f (a
0, ) is a real analytic
function on p0 that represents a free function on the real twistor space t (u ) of u . thus, formula
(4.47) denes the connection between vector elds  from (4.10), (4.11)-(4.13) and functions f
from (4.33), (4.34).

5 self-dual gravity hierarchy

5.1 the solution space of the sdg equations

in what follows we will briey discuss symmetries from the viewpoint of geometry of innite-
dimensional solution spaces. from now on, eqs.(3.7)-(3.9) will be called the sdg equations if
a tetrad {w a, wa} is chosen in the form (3.10), (3.11). these equations are equivalent to the
rst plebanski equation. so, the self-dual tetrads (3.10), (3.11) and self-dual metrics (3.16) are
parametrized by a function  satisfying eqs.(3.12). consider the space of all solutions to the sdg
equations and denote it by n . then formula (3.16) denes the projection

p : n  m

(5.1)

of the space n on the space m of the self-dual metrics describing physical degrees of freedom of
the sdg gravity.

let us consider transformations of the space n into itself dened by the formula

 7  =  + f (ya) + g(y

a),

(5.2)

where f and g are arbitrary functions of ya and y a, respectively. it is easy to see that  and 
determine the same tetrad (3.10), (3.11) and metric (3.16) since functions f (ya) + g(y a) belong
to the kernel of the projection (5.1). it should be stressed that we consider the space n of local
solutions to the sdg equations.

in sections 4.1-4.4 we have described solutions  of the linearized (around ) sdg equations.
from the geometric point of view, solutions of the linearized sdg equations are vector elds on
the solution space n , i.e. sections of the tangent bundle tn . therefore innitesimal symmetries
of the sdg equations form the algebra vect (n ) of vector elds on n . as it has been shown above,
this algebra is isomorphic to the algebra of vector elds on the real twistor space t (u ).

notice that describing symmetry algebras of the sdg equations generated by algebras of vector
elds on u  m is equivalent to dening homomorphisms of these algebras into the algebra
vect (n ). for instance, in sections 4.2 and 4.3 we have actually described the homomorphism of
the algebra sdi c
2  c[, 1] into the algebra vect c(n ). in other words, by considering some

21

given group g (e.g. the loop group lsdi c
2 )) as a candidate for the symmetry
group of the sdg equations, one should say about dening its action on the solution space n .
accordingly, one can consider the innitesimal action of the group g on n and a homomorphism
of its lie algebra into the algebra vect (n ) of vector elds on n .

2 = c(s1, sdi c

5.2 abelian symmetries and ows on the solution space

we consider eqs.(3.7)-(3.9) with a tetrad of the form (3.10), (3.11), parametrized by a function
. in sections 4.2-4.4 we discussed symmetries of these equations generated by vector elds  =
aa  sdi c
2  sdi c(m ) such that [ a, ] = 0 and aa = 0. consider the obtained symmetry
algebra sdi c
2  c[, 1] and the abelian subalgebra c2  c[] in it, generated by the translations
along a  /ya, a = 1, 2. in other words, let us choose a as  and substitute it in (4.23),

where  = 12  21,  =  (y1y1  y2y2). then with the help of recurrence formulae (4.25)
we shall nd all n

a with n > 0 and substitute them into formulae (4.26),

assuming that n

a = 0 for n < 0. accordingly, in formula (4.38) we set

with n > 0 using the recurrence relations (4.35)-(4.37) (see sections 4.2 and 4.3). formulae (5.3),
(5.4) and (5.5), (5.6) dene the action of the algebra c2  c[] on {w b, wb} and .

in sect.5.1 we discussed innitesimal symmetries of the sdg equations as vector elds on
the solution space n .
in particular, an innite number of commuting symmetries (5.5), (5.6)
corresponds to an innite number of commuting vector elds n
a =
n
a at the point   n , n = 0, 1, ... . to these vector elds we can correspond the system of

solutions of the linearized sdg equations are vector elds tangent to the ows and eqs.(5.7), (5.8)
are mutually consistent because the ows commute. we denote by + the group corresponding
to the algebra c2  c[] with the generators {n
a}. the parameters ta
n can be considered as
coordinates on a subspace t of the solution space n . notice that the space n of local solutions
to the sdg equations can be described as an orbit of the loop group lsdi c
2 , and the coordinates
1 , ...) parametrize an orbit t of the abelian subgroup + of the group lsdi c
t = (ta
2 .
the action of this group on a seed solution (t = 0) embeds it in a family of new solutions (t),
labelled by the parameters t = (ta

the vector elds n

put m = n = 1 in eqs.(5.21)-(5.23) and use (5.14)-(5.16) and (5.17), (5.18). then eqs.(5.21)-

so eqs.(5.35) of the sdg hierarchy generated by  a are complex conjugation of eqs.(5.27) and

hierarchy.

and therefore give rather trivial new solutions. but the higher ows generated by n

give less trivial new solutions. we have shown above that the sdg equations are embedded in an
innite system of partial dierential equations, and every solution of the sdg equations can be
extended to a solution of the innite system of equations (5.27) of the sdg hierarchy.

to understand the geometric meaning of these equations, let us truncate the sdg hierarchy,

i.e. suppose that

n
a = 0 for n > r,

(5.37)
where r  0 is an integer. then we have a nite number of 2(r + 1) linear equations (5.20) with

1  n  r  1 on complex functions a
m, n = 1, 0, ..., r  1 on a function  of 2(r + 2) variables t = (ta

of equations on  we shall call the sdg hierarchy up to level r, and denote it by sdg(r).
in
particular, sdg(0) equations coincide with the rst plebanski equation, and the sdg hierarchy
equations are obtained when r   and will be denoted by sdg().

n with n = 1, 0, ..., r are local coordinates on some complex manifold of

4-manifold described locally by the plebanski equations. manifolds mr and their geometry have
been described by alekseevsky and graev [31] in the dierential geometry setting. we shall briey
describe their approach and compare it with our approach based on ideas of symmetry, integrability
etc.

recall that any holomorphic line bundle over the projective line cp 1 is isomorphic to the
holomorphic line bundle o(r + 1)  cp 1 of chern class (r + 1) for some integer r. for r  1
the space of holomorphic sections of o(r + 1) is h 0(cp 1,o(r + 1))  sr+1c2 = cr+2. the space
cr+2 is the space of irreducible representation of type ( 1
2 (r + 1), 0) of the group sl(2, c) having
noncompact real forms su (1, 1)  sl(2, r)  sp(2, r). a holomorphic vector bundle n of rank
l over the riemann sphere cp 1 is called (r + 1)-isotonic if it is decomposed into a direct sum of
l copies of the line bundle o(r + 1) : n  lo(r + 1) = o(r + 1)  ...  o(r + 1) [31]. we shall
the bundle n = o(r + 1)  o(r + 1). the space of holomorphic
consider the case l = 2, i.e.
sections h 0(cp 1, n ) of this bundle n carries a tensor product structure (grassmann structure),
since

h 0(cp 1, n ) = h 0(cp 1, n  o(r  1))  h 0(cp 1,o(r + 1))  c2  cr+2.

(5.38)

on the space c2 we always dene the antisymmetric bilinear form with components ab (a volume
form). therefore the automorphism group of the bundle n = o(r + 1)  o(r + 1) is the group
sl(2, c)  sl(2, c), where the left group sl(2, c) acts irreducibly on c2 and the right group
sl(2, c) acts irreducibly on cr+2.

consider a complex 3-dimensional manifold z. let  : z  cp 1 be a holomorphic bration
over the riemann sphere cp 1. a rational curve p in z is called (r + 1)-isotonic if its normal bundle
np = tz/t p is isomorphic to the bundle o(r + 1)o(r + 1) over cp 1  z [31]. for such curves
the space h 0(p, np ) of holomorphic sections of np is isomorphic to the space ep hp  c2cr+2.
a section  : cp 1  z is called (r + 1)-isotonic if the curve (cp 1) is (r + 1)-isotonic [31]. at

(i) z is a holomorphic bre bundle  : z  cp 1 over cp 1,
(ii) the bundle admits a (r+1)-isotonic section  of ,
(iii) there exists a holomorphic relative symplectic 2-form  of weight 2(r + 1) on z.

then there exists a family of (r + 1)-isotonic sections containing  and the parameter space of
holomorphic sections is a 2(r + 2)-dimensional complex manifold mr with a natural sl(2, c)1r+2-
structure.

for proof see [31]. notice only that the proof is based on a theorem of kodaira [32] which asserts
that if the sheaf cohomology group h 1((cp 1), n) vanishes then a suciently small deformation
of the (r + 1)-isotonic section  remains a (r + 1)-isotonic section and may be integrated to a
deformation of the projective line (cp 1), which makes the parameter space of all holomorphic
sections of z a complex manifold mr with the tangent space tmr at the point   mr isomorphic
to
(5.39)
therefore the tangent bundle t mr is isomorphic to the tensor product e  h of a holomorphic
vector bundle e  mr of rank 2 with bres e  c2 at   mr and the trivial vector bundle
h = mr  cr+2. the holonomy group sl(2, c)  sl(2, c)  1r+2 of the manifold mr is very
small, which impose severe restrictions on geometry of mr.
in particular, a metric on mr is
parametrized by the function (ta
r ), and any metric connection always has a torsion
except the case r = 0, when one can introduce the standard levi-civita connection. notice that
(r + 1)-isotonic sections, that are real (i.e. preserved by  ), are parametrized by a real 2(r + 2)-
dimensional submanifold of mr.

how are the results by alekseevsky and graev connected with ours? what is the geometric
meaning of linear equations (5.20) and the sdg(r) equations? answers are the following. as a
manifold z we considered the 3-dimensional complex manifold p = p+p0p that is dieomor-
phic to the manifold u  s2 as a real manifold (see sect.3.4). this manifold p is a holomorphic
bre bundle
(5.40)

equations (5.20) with n = 1, 0, ..., r1 dene (r + 1)-isotonic sections ( h+) = (, a

tb
r , )) of the bundle (5.40). these sections exists if the compatibility conditions (5.21)-(5.23) are
satised. equations (5.21)-(5.23) are equivalent to eqs.(5.27) with 1  m, n  r  1 (sdg(r)
equations). notice that if a
 dene a (r + 1)-isotonic section of the bundle (5.40), the relative
symplectic form  takes values in the bundle o(2r + 2) and therefore on p0 = p+  p we have
(5.42)

+(tb

.

this means that | p+ may be written as a polynomial of degree 2(r + 1) in   h+.

in the at limit, when  = 0 and the sdg(r) equations are satised identically, solutions of

equations (5.20) and (5.29) have the form

(5.43)

this means that in the at limit the space p is biholomorphic to the bundle o(r + 1)o(r + 1) 
cp 1, and the functions (5.43) dene global sections of this bundle. to clarify the connection with
representations of the groups sl(2, c) and su (1, 1), we introduce on cp 1 homogeneous coordinates
(a) = (1, 2) so that  = 2/1. we can then write the coordinates ta

the sdg(r) equations always have a family of solutions containing the trivial solution  = 0
since due to the kodaira theorem [32] there exist a family of (r + 1)-isotonic sections of the bundle
(5.40) containing the sections (5.43), (5.44). in particular, eqs.(3.17) dene 1-isotonic sections of
the bundle (5.40), and such sections exist if  satises the rst plebanski equation. the existence
of solutions  of eqs.(5.27) of the sdg hierarchy is equivalent to the existence of (r + 1)-isotonic
sections of the bundle (5.40) for any integer r  0.

6 brst quantization of the closed n=2 string

6.1 constraints, ghosts, and pictures

in sections 4 and 5 we have described hidden symmetries of the self-dual gravity equations and
the sdg hierarchy generated by the abelian symmetries. we now come back to the n =2 string to
present hidden string symmetries, which will be seen to originate from so-called picture-changing
and spectral ow operators naturally occurring in the brst approach. later on, we will compare
those string symmetries with sdg symmetries and nd agreement.

the brst procedure is most convenient for a manifestly su (1, 1) covariant quantization of the
n =2 string [33]. in the n =2 superconformal gauge, the n =2 supergravity multiplet is reduced to
its moduli plus the super virasoro constraints

and their right-moving copy ( t , g, j). we have switched to worldsheet light-cone coordinates
(z, z), so that z and  is one-component weyl. the dot product denotes the su (1, 1) invariant
scalar product.

a corresponding set of ghost/antighost pairs is introduced,

the canonical commutation resp. anticommutation relations for the matter and ghost elds
are realized on a free eld fock space, which factorizes into a left- and a right-moving part. the

its turns out, however, that the computation of string amplitudes requires a z2-fold copy of our
(left-moving ns) fock space, labelled by so-called pictures charges (+, ). a second set (+, )
of picture charges occurs for the right-moving fock space. the vacuum |+, i of the left-moving
(+, ) fock space diers from the above |0i  |1,1i by the relations
for

(6.5)

,


r |+, i = 0 for

r  1

2


r |+, i = 0

r  1

2 + .

due to the commuting nature of the (, ) ghosts, dierent vacua |+, i (and the fock spaces
built over them) are formally connected only through the action of distributions like (
r ) in
ghost/antighost modes or by extending the fock space via bosonization [8, 34]. hence, dierent
pictures are isomorphic but not identical. unless stated otherwise, normal ordering is understood
with respect to |0i = |1,1i. it will turn out that the picture degeneracy is redundant for the
enumeration of physical string states but crucial for the understanding of the global symmetry
structure.

it is useful to introduce picture operators  which measure the picture charges,

+|+, i = +|+, i

,

|+, i = |+, i

,

(6.6)

and commute with q. another important quantum number is the ghost number g = gl+gr. we
dene the left-moving (chiral) ghost number gl as the eigenvalue of

gl = i hbc + bc + + + +i  +  

(6.7)

so that gl|+, i = 0, and likewise for gr. as usual, q carries g=1, and gl, gr commute with
.

an additional feature of n =2 strings is the presence of spectral ow, which may be interpreted
as an isometry of the maxwell moduli space. its eect on an asymptotic string state is a continuous
shift in the monodromies (around the closed string) of all worldsheet spinors according to their
maxwell charge, thereby interpolating between ns and r sectors. spectral ow acts independently
on left- and right-movers. as it leaves the sum   + +  invariant but continuously changes
the dierence   +  , it is not compact but (for =2) relates dierent (ns) pictures,

s :

|+, i  |++1, 1i

.

(6.8)

29

actually, this action corresponds to a singular gauge transformation creating a maxwell instanton
at the puncture and may be used to relate string amplitude contributions from dierent instanton
sectors [35, 36]. for a given worldsheet topology (j, m ), however, the spectral ow isometry does
not alter the amplitude a(n)
j,m since in the sum over all external string legs the picture shifts and
the instanton charges must cancel out, according to the selection rule

n

xi=1

()i =

n

xi=1

()i = 1

2 (j  m )  n = 2(#handles)  2  1

2 m .

(6.9)

hence, it suces to restrict oneself to ns sectors (i.e. integral pictures) only, as we do in this paper.

6.2 cohomology for physical states

it is well known that physical states in gauge theories can be identied as brst cohomology
classes of a certain ghost number. for the closed n =2 string, the relevant cohomology is subject
to the subsidiary conditions

(b0  b0)|i = 0

and

0|i = 0 = b
b

0|i

(6.10)

and may be termed b-semirelative and b-relative. the brst cohomology is graded by

 ghost number g  z
 picture numbers (+, )  z2
 spacetime momentum (ka, k a) or k .  r2,2

so that one may restrict the analysis to fock states of a given ghost number, built on picture vacua
|+, ; ki dressed with momentum. it is important to distinguish the exceptional case of k = 0
from the generic case (k 6= 0) which contains the propagating modes.

it has been shown [9] that the generic brst cohomology is non-empty only for

 g = 2 and g = 3
 any value for (+, )
 any lightlike momentum, k  k = 0

and is one-dimensional in each such case. since the g=3 class is merely conjugate to the g=2 class
under the fock space scalar product, it does not represent a second physical state. alternatively,
we may eliminate it by passing to the b-relative cohomology, which imposes

(b0 + b0)|i = 0

(6.11)

on top of the conditions (6.10). since the relative fock space factorizes into left- and right-movers,
the kunneth theorem tells us that the (b- and b-)relative brst cohomology also factorizes in the
same way. for this reason, it suces to analyze the relative chiral brst cohomology which is
graded by (gch, +, , k) and (for lightlike k6=0) nonzero only at gch=1.2
in fact, the physical
states (at g=2) are just products of left-moving and right-moving parts, with chiral ghost numbers
gl=gr=1.

2 here, gch denotes gl or gr, as usual.

30

moreover, for k 6= 0 one may construct picture-raising and picture-lowering operators which
commute with q and do not carry ghost number or momentum [10]. together with spectral ow,
these operators may therefore be used to dene an equivalence relation among all pictures. this
projection of the brst cohomology leaves us with a single, massless, physical mode, in accordance
with the result of ooguri and vafa [1]. it is the string excitation corresponding to the self-dual
deformation  of the metric background or to the prepotential  for a self-dual riemann tensor.
yet, the discussion of the global symmetries will provide a justication for distinguishing dierent
pictures, since dierent picture-representatives of the physical mode will be connected with shifts 
resp. . for a related interpretation of the picture phenomenon, see [37, 38].

6.3 cohomology for global symmetries

it is perhaps less well known that the exceptional (zero-momentum) brst cohomology at ghost
number one harbors all unbroken global symmetry charges of the theory. the argument goes as
follows [39]:

a current with components jz and jz in a two dimensional theory (complex coordinates z and

z) is conserved, i.e. satises jz + jz = 0, when the one-form

is closed. the corresponding charge

(1) = jzdz  jzdz

a = ic

(1)

(6.12)

(6.13)

is conserved if it has the same value for contours c and c that are homologous, i.e. are the
boundaries of some surface ,  = cc. current conservation implies charge conservation by
stokes theorem.
in brst quantization these relations are required to hold only up to brst
commutators. current conservation then reads

d(1) = [q, (2)}

(6.14)

for some two form (2) = (2)
z z dz  dz. brst invariance of the charge requires [q, (1)} = d(0).
applying q to this relation implies that [q, (0)} is a constant. furthermore, this constant must
vanish, since otherwise the unit operator were brst trivial. summarizing, we have the descent
equations

[q, (0)} = 0 ,
[q, (1)} = d(0)
[q, (2)} = d(1)

,

.

moreover, the whole formalism is unaected by the replacements

(0)  (0) + [q, }
(1)  (1) + d ,

,

(6.15)

(6.16)

where  is some form of degree zero. the equations for (0) are precisely the dening relations
for the brst cohomology (on operators instead of fock states). taking as (0) some cohomology
class of ghost number g one can then construct the forms (1) and (2) of ghost numbers g  1 and

31

g  2. it is most natural to choose (0) to have ghost number one. this results in a charge of ghost
number zero that can map physical states to physical states.

as a simple example let us consider target space translations in bosonic string theory. the
only ghost number zero chiral cohomology class is the unit operator, which we may take as the
right-moving piece of the closed string cohomology. as left-moving piece we must take a ghost
number one state that also has vanishing momentum  the only candidate is cx. the forms (i)
take the form (suppressing the right-moving unit operator)

(0) = c x

,

(1) = xdz

,

(2) = 0 .

(6.17)

the charge is just the center-of-mass momentum operator p = h dz

2 x.

to ensure that the charges a generate symmetries on physical states, one must demand not only
that they commute with q but also that their action is compatible with our subsidiary conditions,
i.e.

[a, b0} = 0 = [a, b
0}

and

[a, b0} = 0 = [a, b

0} .

(6.18)

since the (b- and b-)relative cohomology factorizes into chiral parts, we need only compute the
exceptional relative chiral cohomology h ch

rel. poincare duality identies the cohomologies at

(gch, )  (2gch,4  )

,

(6.19)

and spectral ow equates cohomologies diering only in the value of . thus, we may restrict
ourselves to   2 and ignore  and display the current knowledge in the following table [9]:3

since the multiplication of cohomology classes preserves the ghost number and picture gradings, the
ghost-number zero chiral cohomology by itself forms a ring, the so-called ground ring h ch
rel(g=0) [40].
this ground ring is rather important since in some sense it generalizes the unit operator, and it
reveals much about the global symmetries. it is therefore quite remarkable that the ground ring of
the n =2 string contains an increasing number of elements in higher pictures.

for convenience we change the picture labels from (+, ) to spin labels (j, m) via

+ = j + m
++1 = j + m

and

and

 = j  m
+1 = j  m

on operators

on states

(6.20)

and likewise for the right movers. the picture oset of the canonical ground state |  1,1i is
responsible for the distinction. the brst cohomology possesses a natural multiplication rule [40]
which we denote by a dot. the (left-moving) ground ring is spanned by the basis elements

we have introduced the picture-raising operators [41] 4

inverted, x do not have inverses [41]. this fact limits the range of n because each factor of h
(h 1) must be matched by a factor of x+ (x) to make sense.

let us dene yet another combination of picture-raising and spectral ow operators, namely

y = x+  s1 = x  h 1

momentum eigenstates it may be replaced by its eigenvalue, a function h(k). we also like to point
out that the picture-raisers x do not carry any spacetime quantum numbers whereas the spectral

for the complete story, one must combine left- and right-movers. as stated above, symmetry
charges carry total ghost number one. consulting our table, the only way to build a g=1 rep-
resentative is to combine a gr=0 class with a gl=1 class, or vice versa. only counting the rst
possibility, we arrive at least at 4(+1)( + 1) cohomology classes for non-negative values of  and

7 symmetry transformations of physical states

for the discussion of string symmetries, it is revealing not to identify the physical state representa-
tives in the various picture sectors but to distinguish the (boosted) picture-vacua |+, ; +, ; ki
as dierent states. clearly, those states are obtained by applying the ground ring operators o
and o
to the canonical representative, |  1,1;1,1; ki. focusing on the left-moving part,

j, m

j,m

one obtains

o
j,m|  1,1; ki = h(k)(jm)+ |j+m1, jm1; ki
where the phase [42, 43]

h(k) = k1/k

2 = k2/k

1 = (h(k)1)

is just the eigenvalue of our formal operator h. hence, there is an equivalence

|j+m1, jm1; ki  xj+m yjm

(7.1)

(7.2)

(7.3)

modulo powers of h(k).

by virtue of this equivalence, the operators
d+,
j,m = h(jm)+ xj+m+1 yjm x

and

d,
j,m = h(jm)+ xj+m yjm+1 y

(7.4)

have a natural action on states as well: they not only shift the quantum numbers (+, ) of a
state but also pull out an additional factor of +1 from it, since we have added unity to  to
account for the picture oset of the j=0 ground state. thus, we may alternatively use d,
j,m (and
their right-moving images) to generate all physical states from |0,1; ki and | 1, 0; ki (times their
right-moving partners).

in order to nd the transformation laws of the full physical states, we have to apply aa;;

j,m;j, m

and similarly for a  a or b  b. these transformations constitute an innity of global sym-
metries which are unbroken in the at kleinian background. their ward identities constrain the
tree-level scattering amplitudes so severely [7] that all but the three-point function must vanish,
consistent with the direct computations alluded to earlier.

to make contact with the abelian symmetries of self-dual gravity (see sect.5), it suces to
, i.e. putting =0=. it has the important
consider the sub-algebra of symmetry charges a
property that only non-positive powers of the phase h(k) appear when acting by these charges on
physical states. moreover, since the factor h(j+jm m) in (7.5) feels neither of the dierences jj
and m m, one can introduce states

a;0;0

||j, m; kii := xj1,j2

(7.7)

which are symmetric tensor products of left- and right-moving states. these states form a (2j+1)plet
for a xed value of j since m = j,j+1, . . . , j. we also introduce combinations of charges,

corresponding to the symmetric tensor product states (7.7). the action of these charges on the
ground state

has the form

note that for j=0 we nd the translations 0

as was argued in [7], only the linear part of the symmetries (7.13) can be seen in rst-quantized

moreover, in [7] it was shown that the transformations (7.13) can be rewritten in the form

jm

(k) = ka h(k)(jm) (k) + o( 2)

(7.14)
these are just the non-local transformations derived recursively from the global translations ya

ground state ||0, 0; kii corresponding to the eld (k) precisely reproduce the linear part of the
symmetries (7.13) of self-dual gravity.

8 conclusion

this work deepens the identity of closed n =2 strings (at tree-level) with self-dual gravity (sdg)
on 4d manifolds of signature (+ + ), by the following results. after outlining how the sdg
equations emerge in dierent gauges (plebanski i and ii) from the string dynamics, we have analyzed
in detail the non-local hidden symmetries of the sdg equations and introduced an innite hierarchy
of equations (the sdg hierarchy) associated with an innite number of abelian symmetries. we
have then demonstrated how exactly the same symmetries (in linearized form) emerge in rst-
quantized n =2 closed string theory.

interestingly, the stringy source of those symmetries is a non-trivial ground ring of ghost number
zero operators in the chiral brst cohomology. such a phenomenon is familiar from the non-critial
2d string, where the ground ring was exploited to investigate the global symmetries of the theory,
with the result that there are more discrete states and associated symmetries in 2d string theory
than had been recognized previously [40, 39]. the authors of ref. [39] have wondered if their ndings
could be relevant in a realistic string theory with a macroscopic four-dimensional target space.
the outcome of this paper answers their question in the armative by providing the rst four-
dimensional if not yet realistic string theory with a rich symmetry structure based on an innite
ground ring.

more concretely, the symmetry charges are constructed from zero momentum operators of
picture-raising x, picture charge , spectral ow s, and momentum operators pa, p a. the
abelian subalgebra generated by x, s, and a a p a was found to coincide with the abelian sym-
metries of the sdg equations produced by the operators a and the recursion operator r.

our results ascertain that the non-trivial picture structure of the brst cohomology is not just
an irrelevant technical detail of the brst approach but indispensible for a deeper understanding
of the theory. it is, of course, not a simple task to discover the full symmetry group of a string
model. doing so would roughly correspond to having found a useful non-perturbative denition
of the theory.
in this paper we have worked in the standard rst-quantized formalism which is
background-dependent and limits our access to unbroken linear global symmetries.

symmetries generated by the operators b,;

there remain a number of interesting unresolved issues which should be addressed. prominent
among them is the detection of the non-abelian symmetries of the sdg equations in the n =2 string
context. such symmetries constitute an anization of the w algebra of volume-preserving 2d
vector elds. in view of our ndings here, it is tempting to relate them to the non-abelian string
introduced in sect.6.3. another task is
the transfer of our results to the open n =2 string pertaining to the self-dual yang-mills equations,
in leznov or in yang gauge. finally, it would be interesting to nd further examples in which
the picture structure yields non-trivial information about a theory, like it happens for the relative
zero-momentum cohomology of the ramond sector of the n =1 string in at 9+1 dimensional
spacetime [10]. we hope to return to these problems soon.
