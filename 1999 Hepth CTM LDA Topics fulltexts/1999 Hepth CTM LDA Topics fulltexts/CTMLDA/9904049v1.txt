abstract. we show that the reeh-schlieder property w.r.t. the kms-vector is a direct consequence of local-
ity, additivity and the relativistic kms-condition. the latter characterises the thermal equilibrium states of a

relativistic quantum eld theory. the statement remains vaild even if the given equilibrium state breaks spatial

translation invariance.

1. introduction

in this article we will discuss how a strictly local operation can eect a physical system in
thermal equilibrium. let o denote an open and bounded space-time region in minkowski
space ir4 where a local operation a takes place. the rst guess might be that the oper-
ation a gives rise to an excitation of the equilibrium state which is localized in o; i.e.,
with respect to measurements in the causal complement of o the excited state can not be
distinguished from the original equilibrium state.

due to the cluster theorem for (extremal) kms-states this is quantitatively true if a
is picked at random in o and measurements at suciently large space-like distance are
considered. however, we will show that qualitatively the situation is quite dierent: for
any  > 0 and for any normal state , one can nd an operator a strictly localized in o
which, when applied to the kms-vector, produces a vector state  such that k  k < .
to achieve this the operator a must exploit the small but non-vanishing long range cor-
relations which exist in an equilibrium state as a consequence of its analyticity properties;
the latter simply reect the basic stability and passivity properties of an equilibrium state.

1.1. the net of local observables

in the algebraic formulation [h] a qft is casted into an inclusion preserving map

(1)
which assigns to any open bounded region o in minkowski space ir4 a unital c -al-
gebra a(o). the hermitian elements of the abstract c -algebra a(o) are interpreted as

o  a(o)



by simply combining the kms-condition, which characterizes equilibrium states, with the locality assump-

tion we were able to show that there is a tight relation between the infra-red properties of the generator of time

translations and the decay of spatial correlations in any extremal kms-state, in complete analogy to the well

understood case of the vacuum state [ja].

the observables which can be measured at times and locations in o. the net o  a(o)
is isotonous, i.e., there exists a unital embedding

a(o1)  a(o2)

if o1  o2.

for mathematical convenience we embed the local algebras in their c -inductive limit

a = [oir4

the space-time symmetry of minkowski space manifests itself in the existence of a repre-
sentation

(5)

einstein causality is implemented by locality: observables localized in space-like separated
space-time regions commute, i.e.,

a(o1)  ac(o2)

for o1  o

(6)

here o denotes the space-like complement of o and ac(o) denotes the set of operators
in a which commute with all operators in a(o).

remark. let h  l1(ir4, d4x) such that the fourier-transform h of h has compact support.
strong continuity of the group of automorphisms x 7 x implies that the bochner integral

ah = z d4x h(x)x(a),

(7)

exists in a and denes an entire analytic element for the translations. recall that b  a
is called an analytic element for the group of automorphisms x 7 x, if there exists a
complex neighborhood n  ic4 and a function g: n  a such that

g(x) = x(b);

ii)

z 7 (cid:0)g(z)(cid:1) is analytic for all positive linear funtionals  over a.

the algebra of analytic elements a is norm dense in a.



if the map x7x fails to be strongly continuous, then we may proceed by simply restricting the given net

oa(o) to the subnet consisting of those elements of a which comply with the continuity condition (see e.g.

[s, prop. 1.18]).

1.2. thermal equilibrium states

the physical states are described by positive, linear and normalized functionals.
it is
an advantage of the abstract setting that the thermal equilibrium states can be distin-
guished among the set of all physical states by rst principles such as time invarance,
stability against small perturbations or passivity properties (see [hkt-p][pw]). the kms-
condition (see [hhw]) is generally accepted as the appropriate mathematical criterion for
equilibrium. but only recently, buchholz and junglas have shown that the characterization
of equilibrium states by the kms-condition in fact applies to a large class of relativistic
models [bju].

lorentz invariance is always broken by a kms-state [n][o]. a kms-state might also
break spatial translation or rotation invariance, but the maximal propagation velocity of
signals will not be aected by such a lack of symmetry. it was rst recognized by bros
and buchholz that a nite maximal propagation velocity of signals already implies that
the kms-states of a relativistic qft have stronger analyticity properties in conguration
space than those imposed by the traditional kms-condition [bb]:

denition. a state  satises the relativistic kms-condition at inverse temperature
 > 0 if and only if there exists some positive time-like vector e  v+, e2 = 1, such that
for every pair of local elements a, b of a there exists a function fa,b which is analytic in
the domain

te/2  te/2,

(8)

where te/2 = {z  ic : z  v+  (e/2 + v)} is a tube, and continuous at the boundary

the relativistic kms-condition can be understood as a remnant of the relativistic
spectrum condition in the vacuum sector. it has been rigorously established [bb] for the
kms-states constructed by buchholz and junglas [bju]. in this letter we will show that
together with the condition of additivity (see (13) below) it implies that the kms-vector
has the reeh-schlieder property.

1.3. thermal representations

once a (relativistic) kms-state  for some inverse temperatur  is xed, the well known
gns-construction provides a hilbert space h and a thermal representation  of a
such that

(a) = (cid:0) , (a)(cid:1)

a  a.

(10)

4

christian d. j akel

the representation  assigns to any o  ir4 a von neumann algebra

the weak closure respects the local structure, i.e.,

r(o) = (cid:0)a(o)(cid:1)

.

r(o1)  r(o2)

for o1  o
2.

(11)

(12)

note that r(o) denotes the commutant of r(o) in b(h), an algebra that includes
both r

 and r(o) as subalgebras. the net o  r(o) is called additive, if

ioi = o  ir(oi) = r(o).

(13)

if  is locally normal w.r.t. the vacuum representation, then additivity in the vacuum
sector and additivity in the thermal sector are equivalent. as is well known, additivity
in the vacuum sector can be proven, if the net of local algebras is constructed from a
wightman eld theory.

proposition 1.1. let  be a state which satises the relativistic kms-condition at
inverse temperature  > 0 and let v be an open neighborhood of 0 in ir4.

it follows that for each complex-valued testfunction f with support in v

zir4ir4

d4y1d4y2 fa,a(ie + y1, ie + y2)f (y1) f (y2)  0

(14)

for all 0 <  < /2. here e denotes the time-like vector distinguished by the relativistic
kms-condition.

proof. let a  a. it follows that

f := zv

d4y1 f (y1)y1(cid:0)ie(a)(cid:1)  h.

(15)

thus

zir4ir4

d4y1d4y2 fa,a(ie + y1, ie + y2)f (y1)f (y2) = kf k2  0.

in the last inequality we have used kank = ka
that {fn}nin is a cauchy sequence uniformly on u , where

u := {(ie + y1, ie + y2) : y1, y2  ir4, 0 <  < /2}.

(21)

the limit function f is therefore continuous and bounded on u and analytic in u. more-
over,

f(y1, y2) = fa,a(y1, y2)

for

y1, y2  ir4.

(22)

thus, due to their analyticity properties, the functions f and fa,a must coincide on
te/2  te/2. it follows that

2. the reeh-schlieder property

due to the kms-condition the vector  is not only cyclic for r := (a) but also
separating. thus any state, which is normal w.r.t. , is a vector state [br, 2.5.31].
the problem of nding  for a given state   a local operation a in a(o) such that
k  k < , where  is the vector state induced by  := (a), therefore reduces to
proving that  is suciently close to  in the hilbert space topology.

in fact, we will show that for every vector   h there exists an operator in

(cid:0)a(o)(cid:1), which, when applied to , generates a vector which is arbitrarily close to .

the proof will proceed in several steps. we start with the following adapted and simplied
version of glasers theorem 1 ([g a], see also [g b][bem]):

theorem 2.1. let a  a. the following properties are equivalent:

i.) there exists an open neighborhood v of 0 in ir4 and a point z1  te/2 such
that z1 + v  te/2 and such that for each complex-valued testfunction f with
support in v

zir4ir4

d4y1d4y2 fa,a(z1 + y1, z1 + y2)f (y1)f (y2)  0.

(24)

ii.) there exists a sequence (cid:8)f (n)

a (cid:9)nin of functions holomorphic in te/2 such that

fa,a(z1, z2) = xnin

f (n)
a (z1)f (n)

a (z2)

(25)

holds in the sense of uniform convergence on every compact subset of te/2 
te/2.

the crucial step is summarized in the following

proposition 2.2. for each a  a the vector valued function a: ir4  h,

can be analytically continued from the real axis into the domain te/2 such that it is weakly
continuous for z  0.

x 7 (cid:0)x(a)(cid:1)

(26)

remark. as emphasized in the introduction, we do not require that there exists a unitary
operator in b(h) which implements space-like translations. thus the relativistic kms-
condition only applies to elements of a and in general it will not extend to (a).

the reeh-schlieder property ...

proof. let a, b  a with kak = 1. because of

(a) = h

7

(27)

the set of vectors {(b) : b  a} is dense in h. now consider, for z  te/2 and a  a
xed, the map

(b) 7 xnin

f (n)
a (z) f (n)

b

(0).

using kak  1,

2

= fa,a(z, z),

and the schwarz inequality, we nd

xnin(cid:12)(cid:12)f (n)
a (z)(cid:12)(cid:12)
(0)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

2

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)xnin

f (n)
a (z) f (n)

b

 fa,a(z, z)  k(b)k2.

(28)

(29)

(30)

(34)

(35)

(36)

by the hahn-banach theorem the map (28) extends to a bounded continuous linear func-
tional a,z on h. the riesz lemma ensures that there exists a vector a(z)  h such
that

the map

a,z() = (cid:0) , a(z)(cid:1)

  h.

z 7 a(z)

(31)

(32)

is analytic for z  te/2. (this can be shown by an approximation argument similar to
the one given in the proof of proposition 1.1.) as can be seen more easily, it is also weakly
continuous at the boundary set z = 0, where

a(x) = (cid:0)x(a)(cid:1)

x  ir4.

(33)



corollary 2.3. let a, b  a and let a, b denote the associated vector valued functions.
it follows that

for all z1, z2  te/2.

fa,b(z1, z2) = (cid:0)a(z1) , b(z2)(cid:1)

proof. the l.h.s. as well as the r.h.s. denes a holomorphic function on

moreover, for z1  0 and z2  0 we nd

te/2  te/2  ic4  ic4.

(cid:0)a(x1) , b(x2)(cid:1) = (cid:0)(x1(a)) , (x2(b))(cid:1)

= (cid:0)x1 (a)x2(b)(cid:1) = fa,b(x1, x2)

for all x1, x2  ir4. thus the l.h.s. and the r.h.s. describe the same analytic function. 

8

christian d. j akel

what remains to be proven is fairly standard. borchers and buchholz [bob] recently
gave a nice and transparent formulation of this nal part of the argument and therefore
we will simply reproduce their formulation here, up to minor notational dierences.

denition. let o be any open region. the -algebra b(o) is dened as the set of
operators b  a(o) for which there exists some neighborhood n  ir4 of the origin such
that

x(b)  a(o)

x  n ,

where the neighborhood n may depend on b.

b(o) is a -algebra and

a(o)  b(o)

for any region o whose closure lies in the interior of o.

lemma 2.4. let   h be a vector with the property that

it follows that the functions

vanish for all b  b(o).

(cid:0) , (b)(cid:1) = 0

b  b(o).

ir4  x 7 (cid:0) , (cid:0)x(b)(cid:1)(cid:1)

(37)

(38)

(39)

(40)

proof. let b  b(o) and let n as in (37). it follows from the denition of b(o) and the
strong continuity of the translations that there exists some  > 0, which may depend on b,
such that

on the other hand the function

x(b)  b(o)

for

|x| < .

ir4  x 7 (cid:0)x(b)(cid:1)

(41)

(42)

extends analytically to some vector-valued function in the domain te/2 by proposition 2.1.
combining these two informations it follows that

for all x  ir4 and b  b(o).

(cid:0) , (cid:0)x(b)(cid:1)(cid:1) = 0

(43)



the reeh-schlieder property ...

lemma 2.5. assume additivity (13) holds. it follows that

_xir4

(cid:16)x(cid:0)b(o)(cid:1)(cid:17)

= r.

9

(44)

proof. let o be an open subset of o such that its closure o is contained in the interior
of o. it follows that

_xir4

(cid:16)x(cid:0)b(o)(cid:1)(cid:17)

 _xir4

(cid:16)x(cid:0)a(o)(cid:1)(cid:17)

= r.

corollary 2.6. let   h be a vector with the property that

it follows that  = 0.

(cid:0) , (b)(cid:1) = 0

b  b(o).

(45)



(46)

proof. first, we apply lemma 2.3. then we recall that the orthogonal complement

of (cid:0)x(cid:0)b(o)(cid:1)(cid:1) is closed, therefore it coincides with the orthogonal complement of
(cid:0)x(cid:0)b(o)(cid:1)(cid:1)

. finally, lemma 2.4 implies

thus  = 0.

r = h.

(47)



theorem 2.7. consider a qft as specied in section 1.1 and let  be a state, which
satises the relativistic kms-condition. if additivity (13) holds, then

h = (cid:0)a(o)(cid:1),

(48)

for any open space-time region o  ir4. moreover, if the space-like complement of o is
not empty, then  is separating for r(o).

10

christian d. j akel

proof. we have to show that the orthogonal complement of (cid:0)a(o)(cid:1) vanishes. assume

that

obviously, this implies

(cid:0)a(o)(cid:1).
(cid:0)b(o)(cid:1).

(49)

(50)



now corollary 2.5. states that  = 0; i.e., the orthogonal complement of (cid:0)a(o)(cid:1) is
empty. furthermore, if the space-like complement o of o is not empty, then  is cyclic
for r(o)  (cid:0)a(o)(cid:1). since r(o)  r(o), this implies that  is separating

for r(o).

as in the vacuum sector,  shares the reeh-schlieder property with a large class of

vectors:

theorem 2.8. there exists a dense set d  h, such that for all   d

where o  ir4 is again an arbitrary open space-time region.

h = (cid:0)a(o)(cid:1),

(51)

proof. a set d  r of suitable analytic vectors in h may be specied by putting

d is dense in h:

d = n(cid:16) l1 

(a)

2 kak(cid:17) : a  ao.

d = (a) = (a) = h.

the essential step is to show that for arbitrary b  a the function

ir4  x 7 (cid:0)x(b)(cid:1)

(52)

(53)

(54)

extends analytically to some vector-valued function in the domain te/2. the reader is
invited to check that the proofs of proposition 1.1 and 2.1 remain valid if we replace 

by some vector   d. finally, we note that (cid:0) l1  a/2 kak(cid:1) is invertible in a, thus

(a)(cid:16) l1 

(a)

2 kak(cid:17) = (a).

(55)

it follows that (a) = h, which ensures that the arguments given in the proof of

corollary 2.5 apply also in this slightly more general case.

the reeh-schlieder property ...

11

remark. the reeh-schlieder theorem for the kms-vector was rst proven by junglas [ju].
he assumed that the kms-state is locally normal w.r.t. the vacuum and his proof relied
on a result of borchers concerning time-like cylinders in the vacuum representation. only
time translations were used and therefore the standard kms-condition was sucient.
