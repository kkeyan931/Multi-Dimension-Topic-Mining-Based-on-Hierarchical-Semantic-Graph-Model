abstract

the problem of renormalisability of the su(n) theory with massive gauge bosons is rein-

verstigated in the present work, in view of the insucient grounds of argument leading to

the negative answer in the literature. we expound that the quantization under the lorentz

condition caused by the mass term of the gauge elds leads to a ghost action which is the

same as that of the usual su(n) theory in the lorentz gauge. we also show that when the 

functions appearing in the path integral of the green functions and representing the lorentz

condition are rewritten as fourier integrals, the brst invariance is kept in the total eective

action consisting of the lagrange multipliers, ghost elds and the original elds. further-

more, we clarify that the mass term of the gauge elds cause no additional complexity to the

slavnov-taylor identity of the generating functional for the regular vertex functions and does

not change the equations satised by the divergent part of this generating functional. finally,

with succinct grounds of argument we prove the renormalisability of the theory and reveal

that the renormalisability of the theory with the mass term of the gauge elds is ensured by

that of the usual su(n) theory.

i. introduction

as is well known, a negative answer to the problem of whether a su(n) theory with massive

gauge bosons is renormalisable was commonly accepted even before knowing the faddeev-popov-

de witt method [13] to quantized the usual non-abelian gauge theories. however, owing to

the unsatisfying treatment on quantization and/or to the lack of experimental evidence for the

higgs bosons of the sul(2)uy (1) electroweak theory, this subject was repeatedly studied (see for

example refs. [47]). in the present work we will aim at to give a positive proof of renormalisability

and avoid to get entangled in the controversies over diering opinions.

since the classical equations of motion make the action invariant under an arbitrary innites-

imal transformation of the eld functions, they certainly make the mass term of the gauge elds

invariant under an arbitrary innitesimal gauge transformation. consequently, such a mass term

which is not gauge invariant will force the classical equations of motion to produce the lorentz

condition. we will expound that the quantization under the lorentz condition leads to a ghost

action which is the same as that of the usual su(n) theory in the lorentz gauge. we will also show

that when the  functions appearing in the path integral of the green functions and representing

the lorentz condition are rewritten as fourier integrals, the brst invariance is kept in the total

eective action consisting of the lagrange multipliers a, ghost elds and the original elds.

we will use two kinds of path integral of the generating functional for the green functions.

one of them consists of the sources associate to all the variables including a. another one is

the generating functional for the green functions in the so-called  gauge, which does not involve

a.

it will be shown that the mass term of the gauge elds cause no extra complexity to the

slavnov-taylor identity of the generating functional  for the regular vertex functions and does

not change the equations satised by the divergent part of . consequently, we will be able to

determine the general form of the counterterms order by order based on the renormalisability of

the usual su(n) gauge theory and prove that the mass term of the gauge elds is hurmless to the

renormalisability of the theory. in this way we will also reveal that the renormalisability of the

theory with the mass term of the gauge elds is ensured by that of the usual su(n) theory.

the method of quantization will be explained in section 2. setion 3 and section 4 are devoted

to prove the renormalisability of the theory. concluding remarks will be given in the nal section.

ii. quantization and brst invariance

with aa, m standing for the su(n) gauge elds and their mass parameter the lagrangian

including the mass term lam of the gauge elds has the form

l = l(n ) + lam ,

(2.1)

where

lam =

1
2

m 2aaa
a ,

l(n ) is the lagrangian of a usual su(n) gauge theory and, in the conventional notations, can be

written as

l(n ) = 

1
4

fa f 

a + l + la ,

fa = aa  aa  gfabcabac .

under the innitesimal gauge transformation, one has

z d4xl(x) = z d4xm 2aaa

a = 

m 2z d4xaaa

1
g

=

1
g

m 2z d4x(cid:0)aa(cid:1)a ,

where a

a stands for the innitesimal gauge transformation of the gauge elds

a

a = 

1
g

a(x)  fabcb(x)a

c (x) .

(2.2)

since the classical equations of motion make the action invariant under an arbitrary innitesimal

transformation of the eld functions, they certainly make the mass term of the gauge elds invariant

under an arbitrary innitesimal gauge transformation. this means that when m is not equal to

zero, the classical equations of motion leads to the following lorentz condition

aa = 0 .

(2.3)

it should be noticed with emphasis that the lorentz condition makes the mass term invariant

with respect to the innitesimal gauge trasformation. consequently, the combination of the action

and the lorentz condition is invariant with respect to the innitesimal gauge trasformation that

satises the following equations

(cid:0)aa(cid:1) = 0 .

3

(2.4)

since such a residual invariance is not broken by the mass term of the gauge elds it is natural

to imagine that the ghost action should be the same as that of the usual su(n) theory in the

lorentz gauge (see for example, ref. [8]). however, this was often disregarded in the literature.

for intance, in the discussion in ref. [9], concerning the massive gauge elds theory without matter

elds, the original form of the generating functional for the green functions was taken to be

z d[a]exp{i(cid:2)i + j 

a (x)aa,(x)(cid:3)} ,

where j 

a (x)aa,(x) is the source term and i is the action dened by l(x). in this way, the lorentz

condition (2.3) was ignored.

taking the lorentz condition into account one should write the path integral of the green

functions inolving only the original elds as

1

n0 z d[a, , ][a] ya,x

 (aa(x)) aa(x)ab (y)ac(z)    exp{ii} ,

(2.5)

where

n0 =z d[a, , ][a] ya,x

(cid:0)aa(x)(cid:1) exp{ii} .

the weight factor [a] is to be determnined. since only the eld functions which satisfy the

lorentz condition can play roles in the integral (2.5), the value of the lagrangian can be changed

for the eld functions which do not satisfy this condition. in view of the fact that the lorentz

condition makes the mass term invariant with respect to the innitesimal gauge trasformation, we

now imagine to replace the mass term lam with a gauge invariant mass term elam which is equal

to lam when the lorentz condition is satised. thus, analogous to the case in the fadeevpopov

method [1-3,8-6], [a] should be gauge invariant and make the following equation valid for an

arbitrary gauge invariant quantity o(a, , )

(cid:0)aa(x)(cid:1) o(a, , )exp{iei} z d[a, , ]o(a, , )exp{iei} ,
z d[a, , ][a] ya,x
where ei is a gauge invariant action obtained by replacing lam with elam . this means that [a]

can be determined according to the fadeevpopov equation in the usual su(n) theory and is

identical to the assumed factor in ref.

[4]. therefore when the theory is generalized to include

the fp ghost elds ca(x) and ca(x), the ghost lagrangian or action has the same form as that

of the usual su(n) theory in the lorentz gauge. namely

l(c)(x) =(cid:0)  ca(x)(cid:1)d

abcb(x) ,

i (c) =z d4xl(c)(x) ,

(2.6)

4

where

d

ab(x) = ab + gfabca

c (x) .

(2.7)

as usual one can further generalized the theory by regarding as new variables the lagrange

multipliers a(x) associated with the lorentz condition. thus the total eective lagrangian and

action are

lef f (x) = l + l(c)(x) + a(x)aa(x) ,

ief f =z d4xlef f (x) .

correspondingly, the path integral of the generating functional for the green functions is

z[, , , , j, j] =

1

n z d[a, , , c, c, ]expni(cid:0)ie + is(cid:1)o ,

(2.8)

(2.9)

(2.10)

where n is a constant to make z[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] equal to 1, is is the source term in the action.

they are dened by

n =z d[a, , , c, c, ]expniieo ,
is =z d4x(cid:2)j 

a (x)aa(x) + ja(x)a(x) + a(x)ca(x)

+ca(x)a(x) + a(x)a(x) + a(x)a(x)(cid:3) ,

where j 

a (x), ja(x), a(x), a(x) and ,  are the sources associate to various elds. it is understood

as usual that in a direct calculation of the path integral, the eective lagrangian lef f contains

some additional i terms.

we now check the brst invariance of the eective action ief f dened by (2.8) and (2.9).

with the gauge elds, the matter elds and the ghost elds transforming as usual, one has

ba

a = d

abcb(x) ,

bca(x) = a(x) ,

g
2

bca(x) = 

fabccb(x)cc(x) ,

bief f = z d4xn(cid:0)ba(x)  m 2ca(x)(cid:1)aao ,

where  is an innitesimal fermionic parameter independent of x. obviously, the eective action

is invariant when the transformation of a(x) are dened as

ba(x) = m 2ca(x) .

5

it is also clear that the transformation is no longer nilpotent.

we are also interested in the  gauge green functions that are dened by replacing the

functions in the numerator and denominator of (2.5) with the gauge-xing term



1
2

(aa)2 ,

where  is a pararmter. the total eective lagrangian and action including the gauge-xing term

and the ghost term become (in the same notations as used above)

lef f (x) = l + l(c)(x) 

ie =z d4xle (x) .

1
2

(aa)2 ,

therefore the generating functional for such green functions is

z[, , , , j] =

1

n z d[a, , , c, c]aa(x)ab (y)ab(z)    expniieo ,

(2.11)

(2.12)

(2.13)

where n is a constant to make z[0, 0, 0, 0, 0] equal to 1, is is the source term

is =z d4x(cid:2)j 

a (x)aa(x) + a(x)ca(x) + c a(x)a(x) + a(x)a(x) + a(x)a(x)(cid:3) .

it shuld be noticed that the lorentz condition will take no eect in the generating functional for

the  guage green functions unless  tends to zero.

iii. renormalisability

as stated earlier, for a long period of time a su(n) theory with massive gauge bosons was

considered to be in general nonrenormalisable (see for example and the grounds were actually

insucient for drawing this conclusion. based on the quantization method explained in last section

we will prove the renormalisability of the theory. in this section we will start with the the generating

functional for the  gauge green functions. the method of reasoning for the theory formalism with

the variables a is similar and will be briey described in section 4.

assume that aa(x), ca(x) and c a(x) stand for the renormalized feild founctions, g, m are

renormalized parameters, and  is an auxiliary parameter. the matter feilds ,  do not aect

the discussion in this section and will be omitted. as usual we dene the composite eld functions

a

a (x) and ca(x) by

ba

a (x) = a

a (x) ,

bca(x) = ca(x) ,

(3.1)

6

where a

a (x) is just d

abcb(x) and ca(x) is 1

2 gfabccb(x)cc(x). introducing new soruces k a

(x)

and la(x) and adding a soruce term of these composite elds into the eective lagranian without

counterterm, one gets

l[0]

e (x) = 

1
4

fa (x)f 

a (x) +

1
2

m 2aa(x)a

a (x)

2(cid:16)aa(x)(cid:17)2

+ (cid:0)  ca(x)(cid:1)d

abcb(x)

+ k a

(x)a

a (x) + la(x)ca(x) .

the complete eective lagranian is the sum of l[0]

e and the counterterm lcount:

le = l[0]

e + lcount .

in terms of the action i [0]

ef f formed by the eective lagranian l[0]

ef f , we dene the generating

functional for green functions

z [0][j, , , k, l] =

1

n z d[a, c, c]expni(cid:0)i [0]

e + is(cid:1)o ,

(3.4)

where n is a constant to make z [0][0, 0, 0, 0, 0] equal to 1, the source term is is given by

is =z d4x(cid:2)j 

a (x)aa(x) + a(x)ca(x) + c a(x)a(x)(cid:3) .

correspondingly, the generating functionals w [0], [0] for connected green functions and regular

vertex functions are

(3.2)

(3.3)

(3.5)

(3.6)

z [0][j, , , k, l] = expniw [0][j, , , k, l]o ,
[0][ea,ec, ec, k, l] = w [0][j, , , k, l]

z d4xhj 

a (x)eaa(x) + a(x)eca(x) + ec a(x)a(x)i ,

where eaa(x), eca(x) and ec a(x) are the so-called classical elds dened by
eca(x) = 

w [0]
a(x)

w [0]
j 
a (x)

eaa(x) =

eca(x) =

,

,

w [0]
a(x)

.

(3.7)

one therefore has

j 
a (x) = 

,

[0]

eaa(x)

a(x) =

,

[0]

eca(x)

a(x) = 

.

[0]

and

[0]

k a

(x)

,

w [0]
la(x)

=

[0]
la(x)

,

7

(3.8)

(3.9)

in order to nd the slavnovtaylor identity satised by the generating functional for the

regular vertex functions, we change the variables in the path integral of z [0] as follows

a

a (x)  a

a (x) + a

a (x) ,

ca(x)  ca(x) + ca(x) ,

ca(x)  ca(x) + 

1


a

a (x) .

the volume element of the path integral does not change and the changes of the source term and

the mass term of the gauge elds lead to

(3.10)

next, by using the invariance of the path integral of z [0] with respect to the translation of the

integration variables ca(x), one can get a set of auxiliary identities

[0]

eca(x)

(3.11)

in the following we will denote by [0][a, c, c, k, l] the functional that is obtained from

[0][ea,ec, ec, k, l] by replacing the classical eld functions with the usual eld functions. dened

since each of these satises equations (3.21),(3.22) a new term appearing when m 6= 0, if any,

should includ m 2 as a factor and also satises (3.21), (3.22). now the equations can not have such

chosen as

count[a, c, c, k, l, g, m ] =

(3.24)

thus the sum of

where n+1, n+1 and n+1 are constants of order (h)n+1. therefore, in order to cancel the n + 1

loop divergence the counterterm of order hn+1 should be chosen as

i [n+1]

count[a, c, c, k, l, g, m ] = 

[n]
n+1,div[a, c, c, k, l, g, m ] .

(3.39)

after including this counterterm and the gauge xing term as well as the mass term of the gauge

feilds i [n+1]

e

, to order hn+1, can be expressed as

i [n+1]

[a, c, c, k, l, g, m, ] = i [0]

therefore, the generating functional

with this, one can verify that 

[n+1]

satises (3.34),(3.35) and is nite to order hn+1. since the

theory can be renormalized to one loop the renormalisability has been proved by the inductive

method.

iv. renormalisability of the theory with variables a

similar to section 3, let aa(x), ca(x) and ca(x) stand for the renormalized feild founctions, g,

m be renormalized parameters. the matter elds  are also omitted. now the eective lagrangian

without counterterm is

l[0]

e (x) = 

1
4

fa (x)f 

a (x) +

1
2

m 2aa(x)a

a (x) + a(x) aa (x)

+ (cid:0)  ca(x)(cid:1)d

abcb(x)

+ k a

(x)a

a (x) + la(x)ca(x) .

the generating functional for green functions is

z [0][j, j, , , k, l] =

1

n z d[a, c, c, ]expni(cid:0)i [0]

e + is(cid:1)o ,

(4.1)

(4.2)

where n is a constant to make z [0][0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] equal to 1, the source term is is given by

is =z d4x(cid:2)j 

a (x)aa(x) + ja(x)a(x) + a(x)ca(x) + ca(x)a(x)(cid:3) .

correspondingly, the generating functionals w [0], [0] for connected green functions and regular

vertex functions are

z [0][j, j, , , k, l] = expniw [0][j, j, , , k, l]o ,
[0][ea,ec, ec,e, k, l] = w [0][j, j, , , k, l]

z d4xhj 

a (x)eaa(x) + ja(x)ea(x) + a(x)eca(x) + eca(x)a(x)i ,

where the classical elds are dened by

w [0]
j 
a (x)

,

eaa(x) =

w [0]
ja(x)

,

ea(x) =

w [0]
a(x)

,

eca(x) =

eca(x) = 

w [0]
a(x)

.

(4.3)

(4.4)

(4.5)

therefore one has

j 
a (x) = 

[0]

eaa(x)

,

ja(x) = 

,

a(x) =

[0]

ea(x)

[0]

eca(x)

13

,

a(x) =

(4.6)

[0]

eca(x)

and

w [0]
k a
(x)

=

[0]

k a

(x)

,

w [0]
la(x)

=

[0]
la(x)

.

(4.7)

in order to nd the slavnovtaylor identity satised by the generating functional for the

proper functions, we change the variables in the path integral of z [0] as follows

a

a (x)  a

a (x) + a

a (x) ,

ca(x)  ca(x) + ca(x) ,

ca(x)  ca(x)  a(x) ,

a(x)  a(x) .

the volume element of the path integral does not change and the changes of the source term and

the mass term of the gauge elds lead to

k a

z d4xn [0]
ea(x)

(x)

a(x)

[0]

ea

[0]

+

[0]
la(x)

[0]

eca(x)

[0]

k a

(x)o = 0 .

 m 2eaa(x)

next, by using the invariance of the path integral of z [0] with respect to the translation of the

integration variables ca(x) and a(x), one can get a set of auxiliary identities

(4.8)

(4.9)

(4.10)

(4.14)



[0]

k a

[0]

eca(x)

[0]

ea(x)

 eaa(x) = 0 .

let [0][a, c, c, , k, l] be the functional that is obtained from [0][ea,ec, ec,e, k, l] by re-

placing the classical eld functions with the usual eld functions. dened 

as

[0]

[0]



= [0] z d4xna(x)aa(x)o z d4xn 1

2

m 2a

a (x)aa(x)o .

thus from (4.8)(4.10) we have

[0]

z d4xn 

k a

(x)

[0]

a (x)

+

[0]


la(x)

[0]



ca(x)o = 0 ,

k a

a(x)

= 0 .

it is now obvious that the method used in last section can be followed to prove the renormalisability

of the theory.

v. concluding remarks

we have expounded that the quantization under the lorentz condition caused by the mass

term of the gauge elds leads to a ghost action which is the same as that of the usual su(n) theory

in the lorentz gauge. we have also shown that when the theory is generalized by regarding as

new variables the lagrange multipliers a(x) associated with the lorentz condition, the brst

invariance is kept in the total eective action consisting of a, ghost elds and the original elds.

as a result of the mass term of the gauge elds, such a kind of brst transformation is not nilpotent

and can change the volume element of the path integral.

furthermore, we have claried that the mass term of the gauge elds cause no extra complex-

ity to the slavnov-taylor identity of the generating functional for the regular vertex functions. in

particular, the equations satised by the divergent part of this generating functional are indepen-

dent of m . consequently, we have been able to determine the general form of the counterterms

order by order based on the renormalisability of the usual su(n) gauge theory and prove that the

mass term of the gauge elds is hurmless to the renormalisability of the theory. in this way we

have also revealed that the renormalisability of the theory with the mass term of the gauge elds

is ensured by that of the usual su(n) theory.
