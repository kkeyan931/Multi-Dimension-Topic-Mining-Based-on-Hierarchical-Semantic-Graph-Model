abstract

we show that the moduli space of supersymmetric black holes that arise in the

ve-dimensional n = 2 supergravity theory with any number of vector multiplets is

a weak hkt manifold. the moduli metric is expressed in terms of a hkt potential

which is determined by the associated very special geometry of the supergravity

theory. as an example, we give explicitly the black hole moduli metric for the stu

model.

1. introduction

in the last few years, there has been much interest in supersymmetric black

holes in ve dimensions. this is because of the strominger and vafa [1] microscopic

derivation of the bekenstein-hawking entropy for a class of such black holes. the

low energy description of m-theory compactications on six-dimensional calabi-
yau manifolds [2, 3] and heterotic string theory compactications on k3  s1 [4]
is given by n = 2 supersymmetric ve-dimensional supergravity theories (eight

supercharges) coupled to vector and scalar multiplets [5]. a novel property of

the n = 2 supergravity theories, as shown by b. de wit and a. van proeyen in

[6], is that the couplings of the vector multiplets can be determined in terms of

geometric data on very special manifolds. these theories admit electrically charged

supersymmetric black hole solutions which preserve 1/2 of supersymmetry. sabra

and chamseddine in [7] have shown that these black holes can be described in

terms of the underlying very special geometry.

viewing the supersymmetric black holes as the bps soliton solutions of su-

pergravity theories, their low energy dynamics can be approximated by geodesic

motion in a moduli space. some black hole properties like low energy scattering

and the presence of bound states can be investigated by studying the geometric

structure of the moduli spaces. in turn these may have applications in the under-

standing of m-theory and its compactications and perhaps provide another way

of deriving the bekenstein-hawking entropy formula. recently it has been realized

that the black hole moduli spaces exhibit geometric structures that are related to

those that appear on the target spaces of one-dimensional supersymmetric sigma

models [8]. this is because the low energy eective theory of black holes, which

is an one-dimensional sigma model, has as many supersymmetries as thosed pre-

served by the associated solutions [9, 10]. an example of such geometry is that of

hyper-kahler with torsion (hkt) [11] which arises in a class of one-dimensional

sigma models with four supersymmetries based on the n = 4b multiplet; for appli-

cations in mathematics see grantcharov and poon [12]. in particular, it has been

1

shown in [10] that the moduli space of ve-dimensional black holes that preserve

1/4 of the maximal supersymmetry is a strong hkt manifold. michelson and

strominger in [13] extended this to ve-dimensional black holes which preserve 1/8

of supersymmetry and are electrically charged with respect to the gauge vector

potential of the supergravity multiplet.

in particular, they established that the

moduli space of these black holes admits a weak hkt structure.

in this paper, we investigate the moduli space of electically charged black holes

of ve-dimensional n = 2 supergravity with any number of vector multiplets. we

show that the moduli space is a weak hkt manifold. this is in agreement with the

counting of the number of unbroken supersymmetries of the black hole solutions

and the expected n = 4b multiplet structure of the eective theory. the hkt

metric can be expressed in terms of a hkt potential

 = z d4x e6u

(1.1)

where u is determined by the very special geometry of the supergravity theory.

in this way, we establish a relation between the very special geometry that arises

in n = 2 supergravity theory and the weak hkt geometry that arises in one-

dimensional supersymmetric sigma models. we give as an explicit example the

moduli space metric of the black holes that arise in stu model associated with
the k3  s1 compactication of the heterotic string.

this paper is organised as follows: in section two, we describe the supersym-

metric electrically charged black hole solutions of n = 2 ve-dimensional super-

gravity theory and establish our notation.

in section three, we give the black

hole moduli metric and show that it is weak hkt. in section four, we present an

example associated with the stu model and in section ve we give our conclusions.

2. the black holes of five-dimensional supergravity

in this section we shall review some facts about very special geometries and

their applications to ve-dimensional supergravity. the bosonic part action of

ve-dimensional n = 2 supergravity with k vector multiplets is associated to a
hypersurface n of rk dened by the equation

v (x) 

1
6

cijk x ix j x k = 1

(2.1)

where {x i; i = 1, . . . , k} are standard coordinates on rk and cijk are constants.
in the case of a model arising from a calabi-yau compactication of m-theory, the

constants cijk are the topological intersection numbers of the compact manifold.

3. the moduli metric

the moduli space of the black holes (2.8) reviewed in the previous section

is expected to be a weak hkt manifold. this is because that although these

solutions (2.8) include those that have been used in [13] as a special case, in both

cases the killing spinor equations impose to the same conditions on the killing

spinors. consequently, in both cases the sigma models that prescribe the low

energy dynamics have the same type of multiplet. the relevant multiplet in this

case is the n = 4b which is associated with the weak hkt geometry [8, 10].

in many moduli problems, much of the geometric structure on the moduli space

is induced from the geometric structure of the underlying space(time). for the
black holes (2.8), the spatial transverse space is r4 and so it admits a (constant)

hypercomplex structure. the hypercomplex structure of the hkt moduli space is
induced from that of r4.

to compute the metric on the black hole moduli space, we follow [14, 15, 16]

and allow the positions yia to depend on time, i.e.

yia  yia(t) .

in addition, we perturb the metric and the gauge potentials as

ds2  ds2 + 2e4u pmdtdxm
ai
0dt  ai

0dt + (di

m  e2u x ipm)dxm

(3.1)

(3.2)

where we take pm and di
m to be rst order in the velocities and we have set
x = (t, xm), m, n = 1, . . . , 4. the scalar elds are not perturbed linear in the
velocities. the pm and di

m will be determined by solving the supergravity eld

equations.

next we solve the supergravity equations taking into account the source terms

to rst order in the velocities. the relevant equations are those of the gauge vector

5

potential and those of the metric. the eld equation of the scalars vanishes to the

rst order in the velocities. for convenience, we dene

fmn = mpn  npm

(3.3)

substituting the ansatz (3.2) into the eld equations and collecting the terms linear

in the velocities, we nd

where indices are raised and lowered with respect to the euclidean metric on r4.

to derive the above equations, we remark that from the eld equations of the

respectively. we have also used the identities

0n(e2u ) =

x i0nhi + e2u nxi0x i .

(3.6)

it remains to calculate the moduli metric. for this, we must substitute the

terms s(2) and s(2)
the second order term in the source free action is

source which are quadratic in the velocities up to surface terms.

from this we can easily read the moduli metric which turns out to be weak hkt.

(no sum over i and j). for a generic choice of very special geometry and a generic

choice of a black hole solution, the torsion of the hkt geometry is not a closed

form. so the moduli space of the n = 2 supergravity black holes is a weak hkt
manifold with metric (3.18) and hypercomplex structure {is}. we remark that
the moduli metric (3.18) has a term symmetric and a term anti-symmetric in the

spatial spacetime indices. the anti-symmetric piece can be written in a basis of
anti-self-dual two-forms in r4. such hkt geometries have been considered in the

past [18].

4. examples

one possibility is to consider black holes that are coupled to a single one-form

gauge potential. for this we choose

c111 = 1 .

(4.1)

the corresponding action (2.4) is that of a pure ve-dimensional supergravity mul-

tiplet which has bosonic elds a graviton and an one-form gauge potential [19]. we

remark that our metric in this case is in agreement with that of [13].

9

alternatively, we can consider the moduli space of black holes that are coupled

to dierent one-form gauge potentials. to give an example, we shall describe in

detail the metric on the moduli space of black holes of the st u model. this model
arises in the context of compactications of the heterotic string on k3  s1 and
the associated very special geometry has been presented in [20]. in this case, we

take i, j, k = 1, 2, 3 and the non-vanishing component of c is

c123 = 1 .

(4.2)

then, x i and e2u are expressed in terms of the harmonic functions as

e2u = (h1h2h3)

and similarly for the rest. observe that the moduli metric has the general structure

of hkt metrics considered in [18].

the moduli metric indicates that there are up to three body interactions. one

possible explanation for this is that these black holes are in the same universality

class as the black holes that are made from three intersecting branes in the case

of toroidal compactications of m-theory to ve dimensions.

in both cases the

black holes preserve the same fraction of maximal supersymmetry. so the three

11

body interactions reect the fact that the black holes are made from three dierent

objects.

now consider the case of three black holes each coupled to a dierent one-form

gauge potential. one might have expected that the moduli metric simplies in this

case in analogy with a similar situation in the context of bps solitons but this does

not seem to be the case here. this might be due to the fact that the two scalars

involved in the model have non-trivial interactions in the action.

5. concluding remarks

we have computed the moduli metric of ve-dimensional black holes of n = 2

supergravity coupled to any number of vector multiplets. we have found that the

moduli space is a weak hkt manifold. one can investigate the near horizon limit

of our moduli metric as in [13]. in particular, we examined the near horizon limit

of the stu model moduli metric that we have presented in the previous section.

we found though that the moduli metric appears to be singular in this limit.

to investigate black hole scattering and black hole bound states a new way to

construct these metrics may be required. although the moduli space of n black

holes can be identied with the conguration space of n particles, the computation

of the metric is local. a dierent construction may provide the tools to nd closed

geodesics in the black hole moduli spaces and so investigate the presence of black

hole bound states.
