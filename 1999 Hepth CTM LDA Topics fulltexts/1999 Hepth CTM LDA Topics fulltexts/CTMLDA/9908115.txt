(12) classical limit h = 0 moyal bracket yields poisson bracket represented single bracket symbol. hence, h = 0 limit action space time independent eld congurations becomes : 4k g2 z d2kq d2kp 2. (13) one equates phase space coordinates, q1, p1, .....q2k, p2k coordinates 4k-dimensional world volume p-brane p + 1 = 4k : 1 = q1, 2 = p1, ....4k1 = q2k, 4k = p2k establishes spacetime independent gauge elds/ coordinate correspondence : a() 1 x() , lp planck length appropriate dimension, see action (13) nothing dirac-nambu- goto (dng) action p-brane moving target spacetime backgrounds dimension 4k, values p + 1 = 4k orthonormal gauge. let us take without loss generality case k = 1 associated p = 3-brane whose world volume four dimensional. h 0 limit yields (13) : l2 p 4 g2l8 p z d4 2 = 4 g2l8 p z d4 i1j1 i2j2 i1 x 1j1 x 2i2 x1 j2 x2 .

(16) previously said, moyal quantization requires phase space seems incompatible action (15) arbitrary world volume metrics, h. solved two step process. firstly, noticing action (15) on-shell equivalent dirac-nambu-goto actions (dng) upon elimination metric h plugging value back action (15) retrieve action : sdn g = z d4 pdet g. g = x x. (17) g induced world volume metric result og embedding p = 3-brane target spacetime background. verify result authors  shown algebraic elimination h yields one physical solution given : (18) , expected, action (15) density solutions h becomes proportional g. second solution  disregarded physical grounds. seen on-shell world volume metric h conformal class embedding metric g. w1g = h. h = w2g. second step one xes 4-dimensional ( euclidean) world volume reparametrization invariance dng action ( obtained elimination auxiliary metric) choosing analog orthonormal gauge dirac-nambu-goto string ( euclidean world sheets) : (x )( x) = . , = 1, 2, 3, 4. (19) one could included scalar factor front (19) one wishes without changing nal results below. hence, one arrives conclusion on-shell solutions auxiliary world volume metric, orthonormal gauge, given conformally (euclidean) metrics : h12 = e12 12 (euclidean) four dimensional world volume metric. action (15) becomes nally : z d4 11 22 x 2x2 = z d4 x 2]2 z d4 (20) lagrangian density (20) becomes sum squares, orthonormal gauge (19) turns constant, should, since orthonormal gauge (19) measure density dng action (17) becomes equal 1. indeed compatible choosing phase space equating world volume p = 3-brane. similar arguments follow eqs-(14a, 14b), making identication : 1 = q1, 2 = p1, 3 = q2, 4 = p2, lagrangian density (14b) also becomes sum squares, since orthonormal gauge (19) cross terms cancel, yields nally constant like occurred (20). fact one gauge lagrangian density constant related fact p-brane moving background = p + 1 = 4k dimensions local transverse degrees freedom : p 1 = 0. sense theory topological. continuing, must emphasize action (14) schild action latter action string, two-dim world sheet, whereas action (14) truly four-dim one. schild action area-preserving dieomorphisms invariant fully reparametrization invariant like dolan-tchrakian p-brane actions. target spacetime dimension saturated, = p + 1 = 4k, dng action becomes trivial : sdn g = z d4 (x 1, x 2, x 3, x 4) (1, 2, 3, 4) . (21) measure integration simply jacobian change variables x i. trivial solution orthonormal gauge conditions (19) given : 4 x 1 = 1. x 2 = 2. x 3 = 3. x 4 = 4. (22) renders jacobian equal unity compatible atness phase space. curved phase space description requires fedosov deformation quantization stated earlier. therefore, sum up, action (14) obtained moyal deformation quantization so(4) yang mills theory r4, h 0 limit, spacetime independent eld congurations, equivalent dng actions ( obtained dolan-tchrakian action (15) elimination auxiliary world volume metric h) , orthonormal gauge, if, if, one equates p = 3-brane tension ( numerical factor) : t3 4 . 4 four dimensional spacetime volume r4 so(4) yang mills theory dened. regularize quantities like volume could select compact spacetime. similar conclusions follow one introduced scalar factor front orthonormal gauge chosen. g2l8 p important emphasize x 6= x. base manifold coordinates one denes so(4k) gym must confused target spacetime embedding coordinates p-brane (p + 1 = 4k). gauge elds a, moyal quantization h = 0 limit, ones behave like p-brane coordinates. general, p-brane tension, p + 1 = 4k, k-dependent numerical constant, : tp 4k . moyal deformation quantization so(4k) generalized yang mills theory (gym), spacetime independent eld congurations, h 0 limit, : g2l8k p 4k g2l8k p z d4k 2. (23) similar arguments k = 1 case allow us show action given (23) equivalent dng actions ( elimination world volume metrics dolan tchrakian p-brane action) , p + 1 = 4k, moving target spacetime backgrounds = 4k, orthonormal gauge (19), world volume spacetime indices run 4k values : z d4k h h11 h22........h2k 2k x 2k x2k . (24) another less restrictive alternative one presented involving elimination auxiliary metric choosing orthonormal gauge write action (24) geometric terms  precisely form gym theory : z d4kx f1......2k f1.....2k z d4k (ei1ei2.....ei2k ) (ej1ej2....ej2k )i1j1 i2j2 .....i2k j2k . tr z dq2kdp2k (25) one written dolan-tchrakian action purely geometric terms given pullback orthonormal one-forms, ei, background 4k spacetime onto 4k-dim world volume . hodge dual star operation given terms world volume metric h. precisely star operation metric encoded. hodge star dual operation gym action dened w.r.t r4k metric usual. since every symplectic manifold equipped almost complex structure, j, metric tensor dened : g(x, ) = (jx, ) vector elds, x, , riemannian metric symplectic manifold. one use gauge elds/coordinates symplectic form/metric correspondence : ask : conditions action l.h.s (25) arbitrary ij, equivalent r.h.s (25) using one-to-one gauge eld/coordinates correspondence (26); i.e. conditions, adx edx. ij h.
