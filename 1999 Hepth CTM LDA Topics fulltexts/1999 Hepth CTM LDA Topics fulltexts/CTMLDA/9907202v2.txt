abstract

we derive a component-eld expansion of the green-schwarz action for the type iia

string, in an arbitrary background of massless ns-ns and r-r bosonic elds, up to quadratic

order in the fermionic coordinates . using this action, we extend the usual derivation of

buscher t-duality rules to include not only ns-ns, but also r-r elds. our implementation

of the t-duality transformation rules makes use of adapted background-eld parametriza-

tions, which provide a more geometrically natural and elegant description for the duality

maps than the ones previously presented. these t-duality rules allow us to derive the

green-schwarz action for the type iib string in an arbitrary background of massless ns-ns
and r-r bosonic elds, up to o(2). implemention of another t-duality transformation on

this type iib action then allows us also to derive the green-schwarz action for the massive

iia string. by further considering t-duality transformations for backgrounds with the two

u (1) isometries of a 2-torus, we give a string-theoretic derivation of the direct t-duality

relation between the massless and massive type iia strings. in addition, we give an ex-
plicit construction of the d = 8 sl(3, ir)  sl(2, ir) invariant supergravity with two mass
parameters that form a doublet under the sl(2, ir) factor.

introduction

t-duality is the most securely founded of the duality symmetries of string theory, being

grounded in worldsheet eld manipulations that do not change the corresponding conformal

eld theory (see reviews [1, 2]). it has been discussed mainly in the neveu-schwarz-ramond

formalism, where couplings to the ramond-ramond sector of superstring theory do not

appear in the classical string action. however, when one is concerned with the eects of

t-duality on nontrivial r-r backgrounds, it is more appropriate to use the green-schwarz

formulation.

in this paper we develop procedures for deriving t-duality in the green-

schwarz formalism. we rst apply the method to a derivation of the standard type iia/iib

string t-duality, including r-r backgrounds. next, we extend the discussion to allow for

backgrounds associated with the massive type iia theory. since this extension of the theory

inherently involves r-r backgrounds, the green-schwarz formalism is ideally suited to

describing the extended t-duality symmetries that relate the massive iia string to the type

iib string. finally, we apply our discussion of t-duality in the green-schwarz formalism

to the case of type iia strings propagating in backgrounds with two abelian isometries. by

this means we are able to exhibit explicitly the t-duality relation between the massless and

massive iia theories.

we begin by obtaining a component-eld expansion of the supereld form of the green-

schwarz action for the type iia superstring in an arbitrary background of bosonic ns-
ns and r-r elds, working to order o(2) in the fermionic coordinates. we do this by

making a double dimensional reduction [3] starting from the superspace form of the d = 11

supermembrane action [4], and using previous results for the component expansions of the

d = 11 superelds [5, 6, 7]. thus we obtain the component-eld expansion of the type
iia green-schwarz string action given in (2.8), to o(2) in the fermionic coordinates, in

arbitrary massless bosonic ns-ns and r-r elds.

performing next the t-duality transformation for a single u (1) isometry, we show how an

appropriate set of background-eld denitions signicantly simplies the t-duality derived

transformations of these elds. we do this by adopting variable choices for the background

elds that are geometrically adapted to the background with its assumed abelian isometry,

which is necessary for implementation of the t-duality map. this leads to a simple set

of expressions for the background-eld transformations that precisely matches the known

forms of nonlinear symmetry transformations in the corresponding eective supergravity

theory. since, in our discussion, we are using a formalism where all the massless bosonic

elds are non-vanishing, this allows us to derive t-duality transformation rules for the

2

r-r as well as the ns-ns backgrounds, in a manner directly comparable with previous

eld-theoretic derivations, but now instead within the framework of the string action.

string-theory t-duality transformations have an advantage over those derived in the

eective eld theory, in that they are carried out without suppressing string excitations

along the directions of the assumed isometries of the background elds. thus, whereas

in supergravity eld theories the assumption of isometries means that one has eectively

made a kaluza-klein reduction to a lower-dimensional theory, this is not the case in string

theory. accordingly, in string theory, one may access the larger groups of nonlinear sym-

metry transformations that appear in supergravity theories upon dimensional reduction,

but without actually sacricing the higher-dimensional modes of the string itself. thus in

our approach we obtain the type iia/iib t-duality in the more general string-theoretic

framework, including r-r background elds, while at the same time employing the more

geometrically adapted description commonly used in eld-theoretic discussions.

the component-eld expansion of the usual type iia green-schwarz string that we

obtain includes non-vanishing backgrounds for the 2-form and 4-form r-r eld strengths

f(2) and f(4). by performing a t-duality transformation with a single u (1) isometry, we

show how the action can again be interpreted as a covariant ten-dimensional action, but

now describing the type iib string. by this means we derive for the rst time a component-
eld expansion of the type iib green-schwarz string action, again to o(2) in the fermionic

coordinates, in arbitrary massless bosonic backgrounds, including the 1-form, 3-form and

from the type iib green-schwarz action we then perform a further t-duality transfor-

5-form r-r eld strengths ef(1) = d, ef(3) and ef(5). the action is given by (3.28).
mation, for a single u (1) isometry along a coordinate y, in which the eld strength ef(1)
is allowed to have a non-vanishing component in the direction of the isometry, ef(1) 
ef(1) + m dy. from a eld-theoretic standpoint this corresponds to performing a scherk-

schwarz generalised reduction, where the axion  is allowed a linear dependence on the

compactication coordinate y. as is well known, this leads to a massive supergravity in

d = 9 which is identical, after a eld transformation, to the ordinary dimensional reduction

of massive [9] type iia supergravity [10] (see also [11, 12]). in our discussion of t-duality at

the level of the superstring action, we are able to derive the additional 0-form contribution

of the mass term m to the background of the iia theory, thereby providing an explicit

expression for the green-schwarz action for the massive iia string, given by (4.4).

since the type iib and the massive type iia theories are related by an appropriately-

generalised t-duality on a circle, and on the other hand the massless iia theory is related

3

to the iib theory by a standard t-duality on a circle, one can expect that it should be

possible to derive a direct t-duality relation between the massless and massive iia theories

themselves, in which the background elds are assumed to have the two u (1) isometries of

a 2-torus. indeed, in [13] a massive supergravity was obtained in d = 8, by performing

a generalised scherk-schwarz reduction of massless type iia supergravity. although not

manifestly the same as the theory that one obtains by reducing massive type iia supergrav-

ity on the 2-torus, it is in fact equivalent up to eld redenitions in d = 8. this formed

an ingredient in the discussion in [14], where the notion of massless/massive iia duality

was developed. the arguments presented there involved the comparison of d8-brane and

d6-brane solutions of the supergravities in d = 8. in the present paper, we are able to

present a direct and explicit formulation of massless/massive iia duality, at the level of

the green-schwarz string action, showing precisely how the t-duality mapping between the

two theories is implemented.

2 type iia superstring action from the supermembrane

we start from the worldvolume action for the supermembrane in d = 11. this is given by

[4]

i3 =z d3(cid:16) qh  1

ijk iz m jz n kz p ap n m(cid:17) ,

m jz n e n

where hij = iz m e m
n  mn is the world-volume metric, z m = (x , ) denotes the
eleven bosonic and 32 fermionic spacetime coordinates, and ap n m is the 3-form supereld.
the supervielbein ea
m and 3-form a were obtained to leading order in  in [5, 6], and more
recently they were completely calculated to o(2) [7]. to this order, setting the spinor

background elds to zero, they are given by:

a = ()( ( )) ,

mnpq f mnpq(cid:17) ,

(2.2)

the notation here is as follows. hatted indices  are used for eleven-dimensional bosonic

coordinates and hatted indices m are used for the eleven-dimensional bosonic tangent-space.

4

fermionic coordinate and tangent-space indices are denoted by  and a respectively. the
quantity t

  is given by

t

  = 1

288 (

   8[



]) .

(2.3)

whenever coordinate indices appear on the dirac matrices, we place hats on the matrices
to indicate that the eleven-dimensional bosonic vielbein e m
m a

 has been used. the quantity
 appearing in (2.2) is of order 2, but does not contribute to any results at this order.1
we now perform a double-dimensional reduction from d = 11, in order to obtain the
superspace action for the type iia string in d = 10, expanded to order 2, in the presence
of bosonic background elds. the bosonic coordinates x  are split as x  = (x , y), and
the eleventh spacetime coordinate y is set equal to the third world-volume coordinate 3;
y = 3. otherwise, all spacetime coordinates are taken to be independent of 3, and the

background elds are taken to be independent of y. the reduction ansatze for these bosonic

background elds are the usual ones, namely

3  ds2

11 = g dx  dx  and ds2

10 = g dx  dx  , with the metrics given by g =

 mn respectively. note that the ten-dimensional metric is in
the string frame here. we also choose to make a rescaling of the fermionic coordinates, in
the process of reducing from d = 11 to d = 10, namely,   e 1
6  . this ensures that
in d = 10, the supercoordinate transformations x  = i    and  =  will take their

 en

canonical forms.

in order to derive the ten-dimensional type iia superstring action from the eleven-

dimensional supermembrane action (2.1) using this reduction scheme, one can follow either

of two procedures. one may rst obtain the ten-dimensional supervielbein components by

dimensional reduction in superspace, and then substitute them into the superspace version

of the d = 10 type iia superstring action,

i2 =z d2(cid:16) 



h  1

2 ij iz m jz n an m(cid:17) ,

(2.6)

or alternatively one may start directly from the d = 11 action (2.1) and work out the

reduction directly in the action at the component-eld level. in the rst procedure, one has

the more familiar one where  =  t. see the addendum section 7 for a more detailed discussion.

it is also convenient to perform additional ten-dimensional local lorentz transformations to

simplify the result. for the vielbein components needed in the type iia string action, we

then obtain after some algebra the following

(2.7)

the type iia superstring action may then be obtained by inserting these expressions, to-

gether with the corresponding reduction of the 3-form eld a, into the d = 10 superspace

form (2.6) of the string action. alternatively, one may apply the reduction scheme directly

in the eleven-dimensional action (2.1). in either way we nd, after some lengthy algebra,

that the ten-dimensional type iia string action, for arbitrary bosonic background elds and

expanded to o(2), is given by i2 =r d2 l2, where2

f(3) = da(2) ,

f(2) = da(1) .

(2.10)

for later convenience, the gamma matrix 11 in (2.7, 2.8) is taken to be the negative of

the matrix  m that corresponds to setting m equal to its eleventh value. 11 is then the
chirality operator in d = 10.3

2a 11 factor was accidentally omitted in the f terms in the earlier and published versions of this

paper. see the addendum section 7 for a detailed discussion of corrections and changes of convention and

notation.

3our conventions are as follows. the dirac matrices satisfy { m, n} = 2 mn, with  = diag (1, +1, . . .+
1). for a majorana spinor , the expressions  m1 mp  vanish for p = (1, 2, 5, 6, 9, 10) and are non-vanishing
for p = (0, 3, 4, 7, 8, 11).

6

a number of remarks on this result are now in order. if we consider a background in

which only the metric and 2-form potential a are excited, the top two lines in (2.8) are
precisely of the standard form, up to o(2). the third line describes an additional o(2)

coupling of the ns-ns eld strength f(3), over and above the standard bosonic coupling
to the worldsheet. the nal line in (2.8) describes the couplings4 of the r-r background
elds f(2) and f(4). the factor of e that multiplies the r-r terms in (2.8) implies that

 loop diagrams involving two insertions of the r-r vertices will give rise to the expected
additional e2 factor in the couplings of the kinetic terms of the r-r elds in the low-energy

eective action.

one further remark that is appropriate at this stage is to note that there is no h r(2) 

coupling of the dilaton to the worldsheet. this is what one should expect; such a term would

explicitly break the conformal invariance of the classical world-sheet action (2.8), which

would contradict the manifest conformal invariance of the classical reduction procedure (see

[15]). moreover, a h r(2)  term would also break the manifest spacetime supersymmetry

of the green-schwarz formalism. whether such a term is actually needed in this formalism

remains an open question. in order to calculate conformal anomalies in the green-schwarz

formalism, one must carefully x the -symmetry gauge and handle its innitely recursive

ghost sector.

in the explicit -function calculations that have been performed, for the

green-schwarz heterotic string at the one and two-loop levels [16], no need has been found

for a h r(2)  term. it may be that such a term only appears out of the quantum measure

upon making the variable changes needed for a transition from the neveu-schwarz-ramond

to the green-schwarz formalism.

3 t-duality and the type iib superstring action

3.1 t-duality in the green-schwarz action

t-duality in the ns-ns sector has been extensively studied at the level of the string sigma

model, starting with [18]. for the type i string, the resulting buscher rules correspond

in d = 9 to a discrete z2 symmetry. for type iia and iib strings, whose ns-ns sectors

coincide but whose r-r sectors dier, it corresponds to a transformation that maps back

and forth between the two theories. in an nsr type of sigma model, one does not see the

couplings of the r-r background elds to the worldsheet, and so the methods used in [18]

4the odd-parity r-r terms proportional to ij were presented in [17]; they are in broad structural

agreement with ours.

7

are not directly applicable to the complete type ii theories. in fact until now, the analogues

of the buscher rules for the r-r elds have been derived only at the level of the eective

low-energy eld theory, by performing standard kaluza-klein reductions of the type iia

and iib supergravities and making the necessary identications of elds that relate the two

theories in d = 9, as in [8, 10]. in this section, we shall derive the generalisation of the

buscher rules for the green-schwarz superstring actions. since, as we have presented in the

previous section, these actions include the couplings of the r-r elds, this will allow us to

obtain a worldsheet derivation of the buscher rules for the r-r elds.

to begin, we write down a generic worldsheet lagrangian with the general structure of

(2.8):


h hij ix  jx  g + 1
l =  1
+
h hij ix  gj + ij ix  bj .

2

2 ij ix  j x  b

(3.1)

note that by comparing this general form with (2.8), the quantities g and b will contain
not only the usual -independent terms g and a, but also certain 2 terms as well. in

fact, it will prove useful to write these as

g = g + q ,

b = a + p ,

(3.2)

where q = q() and p = p[] represent the symmetric and antisymmetric o(2)
terms coupling to ix  jx . the quantities gj and bj, which couple to the single ix 
pullback, will correspond to the  i parts of the fermionic kinetic terms in (2.8).

we now follow the analogue of the standard procedure developed for the bosonic string in

[18]. thus we suppose that there is an abelian isometry of the ten-dimensional background

elds, such that in an adapted coordinate system the elds are all independent of the tenth
of the coordinates x . we shall accordingly decompose the coordinates as x  = (x , y ).

the next step is to replace iy in the lagrangian (3.1) by a worldsheet vector vi, at the

same time introducing a lagrange multiplier z (a worldsheet scalar) and adding the term
ij iz vj. the equation of motion for z enforces the irrotationality of vi. by instead

varying the action with respect to vi, and substituting its algebraic solution back into the

action, we obtain

2


h hij ix  jx  g + 1
l =  1
+
h hij ix  gj + ij ix  bj

h hij g1
 1

00 (ui uj  vi vj) + ij g1

2

2 ij ix  j x  b

00 ui vj ,

(3.3)

8

where

ui  iz + ix  b0  bi0 ,

vi  ix  g0 + gi0 .

(3.4)

note that, following the conventional notation, we associate the index 0 with the y

coordinate.

the lagrangian (3.3) can be seen to be of the same general form as (3.1), with z rather

than y now viewed as the tenth coordinate. recasting (3.3) in the form (3.1) implies that

there will now be a transformed set of background elds, which we shall denote by eg ,
eb , egj and ebj. recalling that g and b include terms both of order 0 and 2,

as indicated in (3.2), we may then read o the full set of transformed background elds,
correct to order 2. at zeroth order in  we nd the usual buscher rules,

00 (a0 a0  g0 g0) ,

g00 = g1
00 ,

(3.5)

00 (g0 a0  g0 a0) ,

g = g + g1
g0 = g1

00 a0 ,

ea = a + g1
ea0 = g1

00 g0 .

00 (p(|0| a)0  q(|0| g)0) + g2
00 q00 ,
00 a0 q00 ,
00 (p[|0| g]0  q[|0| a]0) + 2g2

eq00 = g2

00 q00 a[|0| g]0 ,

00 (g0 g0  a0 a0) q00 ,

(3.6)

at o(2), we obtain the following rules:

eq = q + 2g1
00 p0  g2
eq0 = g1
ep = p  2g1
00 q0  g2
ep0 = g1
egi = gi + g1
ebi = bi + g1

00 g0 q00 ,

00 (bi0 a0  gi0 g0) ,
00 (gi0 a0  bi0 g0) ,

00 bi0 ,
00 gi0 ,

egi0 = g1
ebi0 = g1

in these formulae we have followed tradition [18], in denoting the components of the

metric (the -independent terms in g, g0 and g00) simply as g, g0 and g00.
there is, however, a much more natural way to parametrize the ten-dimensional metric in

terms of nine-dimensional elds, namely by using the standard kaluza-klein decomposition

from d = 10 to d = 9. thus the natural metric to consider in d = 9 is not g, but
rather, g = g + g1
00 g0 g0. (for the mixed and the internal components, there is
no need to make a distinction between g and g.) this can be seen easily from the form of

the string-frame kaluza-klein reduction ansatz, which is

ds2 = ds2 + e2 (dz + a(1))2 ,

(3.7)

9

where ds2 = g dx  dx  , and a(1) = a dx  is the kaluza-klein vector. in the type
7
iia theory, we have  = 1
4 . in terms of the metric decomposition (3.7), it is easy
to see that the standard bosonic buscher rules (3.5) can be rewritten in the more elegant

4  +

form

g = g ,

ea(2) = a(2) + a(1)  a(1) ,

ea(1) = a(1) ,

 =  ,
ea(1) = a(1) ,

(3.8)

where the 2-form potential in d = 10 is reduced to d = 9 according to the standard kaluza-
klein prescription a(2)  a(2) + a(1)  dz. note that the expressions in (3.8) are identical
to those that one nds at the eld-theory level, when mapping the dimensionally-reduced

type iia and iib supergravities into one another in d = 9. (see, for example, [12].)

for the o(2) terms (3.6), we can also obtain a more elegant form by using the technique,

familiar in kaluza-klein reductions, of using tangent-space rather than coordinate indices.

upon doing so, we nd that (3.6) can be re-expressed in the considerably simpler form

eqmn = qmn ,
epmn = pmn ,
egim = gim ,
ebim = bim ,

eqm0 = pm0 ,
epm0 = qm0 ,
egi0 = bi0 ,
ebi0 = gi0 ,

eq00 = q00 ,

(3.9)

where here, m and 0 now denote tangent-space indices. henceforth, we shall always use

tangent-space indices on qmn and pmn. note that all the type iia and iib eld strengths

that appear in our results, including all their non-linear corrections, will now be precisely

the same as one nds in the corresponding supergravity theories. in the conventions that

we are using in this paper, their precise expressions may all be found in [19].

in order to discuss t-duality in the o(2) sector, we must make a nine-dimensional

decomposition of the spinor coordinates. the spinor  in d = 10 has 32 components,

split into 16 chiral and 16 antichiral components.

in d = 9, we therefore obtain two

16-component spinors. we shall decompose the ten-dimensional dirac matrices as follows:

m =  0

m

m

0 ! ,

i

0 =  0

i 0! ,

11 =  1l

0

0 1l! ,

(3.10)

where m is a tangent-space index running over the nine-dimensional range, with corre-
sponding 16  16 dirac matrices m. it should be emphasised that 0 here refers to the
dirac matrix of the tenth direction (and not the time direction!). the 32-component spinor

10

 of the type iia theory (2.8) then takes the form  = 1 + 2, where

0 ! ,
1 =  1
thus we have 111 = 1 and 112 = 2.

2 =  0

2! .

(3.11)

in the type iib theory, which we shall obtain by performing a t-duality transformation,

there are two majorana spinors of positive chirality in d = 10, which we shall denote by
a, with a = 1, 2. these will be related to the spinors a of the type iia theory by5

1 = 1 ,

2 = 0 2 .

(3.12)

3.2 type iia/iib t-duality

with these preliminaries, we are now ready to implement the t-duality transformation on

the type iia action (2.8). the new part of our construction, which goes beyond previous
results, involves the consideration of the o(2) terms, and, in particular, the r-r eld
couplings. firstly, we read o from (2.8) the various o(2) terms in (3.1).

in nucl. phys. b573 (2000) 149, and in v1. of hep-th/9907202, where we dened 2 = i 0 2. while
there was nothing wrong with taking that denition, it did mean that the two chiral spinors 1 and 2 in the

type iib theory were majorana and anti-majorana respectively. see the addendum section 7 for a detailed

discussion of our convention changes in this current version.

where the superscripts on the qmn and pmn indicate the degrees of the r-r eld strengths

involved. the complete expressions for qmn and pmn are obtained by summing the various

ns-ns and r-r contributions listed in (3.13) and (3.14) above.

we now implement the t-duality transformations for the o(2) backgrounds, as given in

(3.9). specically, this means that we should take the expressions given by (3.13) and (3.14),

apply the transformations (3.9), and then seek to re-interpret the resulting tilded quantities

as the 9 + 1 decompositions of fully ten-dimensional covariant tilded backgrounds epmn and
eqmn. it is helpful to study the r-r terms, given in (3.14), rst. it is straightforward to

see that the last step, of re-interpreting the transformed nine-dimensional backgrounds as

the reductions of covariant ten-dimensional ones, is impossible if one tries still to use the

original two a fermionic coordinates of the type iia action (2.8). however, if one uses
instead the a fermionic coordinates, then the transformed nine-dimensional backgrounds
can indeed be expressed as the reductions of covariant ten-dimensional ones.6 to see how

this works, let us consider a sample calculation in detail.

the dimensional reduction of q(4)

mn gives rise to a number of terms, including the con-
tribution to qm0 of the 3-form fmnp that comes from fmnpq. from (3.14), we see that
this contribution will be

where the changed dilaton prefactor results from the conversion of the d = 10 tangent-space

m0 is

related to the (m0) components of an antisymmetric term epmn in the t-duality transformed

theory. one can easily see that it arises from the reduction of the ten-dimensional quantity

a complete chain of analogous t-duality transformations.) in fact if we look at the com-

6it is worth emphasising that this requirement of reinterpreting the t-duality transformed type iia string

action as a covariant ten-dimensional action allows one to deduce the existence of the type iib string with

its chiral fermions and self-dual 5-form.

form to the original untilded  in the kaluza-klein metric decomposition (3.7) for the type

iia theory. the relations (3.18) and (3.19) which we have derived here are precisely the

transformations that relate the dilatonic scalars in the nine-dimensional reductions of the

type iia and type iib supergravities (see, for example, [12]).

it is interesting to note that our derivation of the relations (3.18) and (3.19) in the

present green-schwarz formalism was a purely classical one. by contrast, in a standard nsr

sigma model formulation of t-duality, the derivation of the dilaton transformations requires

a detailed consideration of how conformal invariance can be preserved under quantisation

[1, 2]. the essential dierence in the green-schwarz formalism that has allowed us to obtain

the dilaton transformations from purely algebraic classical considerations is the presence of

r-r background eld strengths in the string action.

after carrying out the entire chain of t-duality transformations (3.9), involving repeated

steps paralleling those that we have illustrated above, we nd that the r-r couplings in

d = 10 become

(3.20)

note that the chirality of the a fermions implies that the 5-form ef(5) is self-dual. note also
that ef(1) = d, where  is the axionic scalar of the type iib theory.

we nd that the type iib 1-form, 3-form and 5-form eld strengths appearing in (3.20)

are related to the 2-form and 4-form eld strengths of the type iia action (2.8) as follows.

reducing the d = 10 type iia elds as

f(4)  f(4) + f(3)  (dy + a(1)) ,

f(2)  f(2) + f(1)  (dy + a(1)) ,

(3.21)

and the d = 10 type iib elds as

ef(3)  ef(3) + ef(2)  (dz + ea(1)) ,
ef(5)  ef(5) + ef(4)  (dz + ea(1)) ,

ef(1)  ef(1) ,

(3.22)

where ef(5) and ef(4) in d = 9 are related by hodge duality, we nd that the nine-dimensional

r-r elds must be identied as follows:

ef(4) = f(4) ,

ef(3) = f(3) ,

ef(2) = f(2) ,

ef(1) = f(1) .

(3.23)

this particular pattern of identications, including the alternating signs, is precisely in

agreement with the results for r-r t-duality that one nds at the eld-theory level. (see,

for example, [12].)

the discussion of the t-duality relations for the ns-ns contributions at o(2) proceeds

in an analogous fashion. following a similar strategy to that described above, we nd that

the various background elds can be rewritten, after applying the t-duality transformations

(3.8), in the d = 10 covariant forms

a number of comments are now in order. firstly, we may observe by comparing (3.13)
and (3.24) that the ns-ns terms at o(2) are identical in form in the type iia and type

iib green-schwarz actions. this is in accordance with what one would expect; it was
already seen, of course, at o(0). a particular consequence of this is that the i a terms
and the 1
mn, p ns
mn,
gim and bim during the implementation of the t-duality transformation, have re-assembled
themselves to make the spacetime lorentz-covariant derivative di a again.

mn mn a terms, which were separated into contributions in qns

4 ix  

a second observation is that in the r-r sector, the expressions for qmn and pmn in the

type iia theory in (3.14) and in the type iib theory (3.20) all have the same structural

form. in all cases, the general structure for the coupling to a p-form is

(3.26)

(in the case of the 5-form eld strength in the type iib theory, the proper handling of the
self-duality constraint implies, as usual, that this term should enter with 1

2 of the canonical

coecient for a p-form.)

to close this section, we may summarise our results for the ten-dimensional type iib

green-schwarz action, which takes the form7

4 green-schwarz action for the massive type iia theory

it has been shown at the level of the low-energy eective supergravities that the massive

type iia theory and the standard type iib theory are related via a t-duality transformation

that diers from the usual one only in that a generalised scherk-schwarz reduction ansatz

is now introduced for the axion  of the iib theory [10]. in other words, one makes the

7we have corrected one typographical sign error that arose in the version of this paper in nucl. phys.
b573 (2000) 149 and v1. of hep-th/9907202, in the ij term on the second line. we have also implemented
the modied denition where 2 is majorana, as discussed in the addendum section 7.

more general kaluza-klein ansatz

(x, z)  (x) + m z

(4.1)

when reducing from d = 10 to d = 9, while keeping all other ansatze unchanged. despite

the linear dependence on z in (4.1), the usual requirement of z-independence of the higher-

dimensional action and eld strengths is still satised, in view of the global shift symmetry
under    + constant.

it is straightforward to implement the analogue of this generalised reduction in the t-

duality transformation of the previous section. thus we now replace the reduction procedure

for ef(1) given in (3.22) by
(as a consequence, ef(1) in d = 9 is now given by ef(1) = d  m ea(1).) we can now use

ef(1)  ef(1) + m (dz + ea(1)) .

the t-duality rules (3.9) in the direction opposite to that which we followed previously,

(4.2)

to deduce the form of the new terms q(0)

mn that we shall acquire in the type iia
string action. as usual, we nd that after applying the t-duality transformation, the nine-

mn and p (0)

dimensional expressions can indeed be lifted to covariant ten-dimensional ones. by this

means, we obtain the following new terms in the ten-dimensional type iia green-schwarz

action:

q(0)

mn = i

2 m e (1 (m n) 1 + 2 (m n) 2) ,

2 m e (1 mn 1  2 mn 2) .
(4.3)
mn we could, of course, replace (m n) by mn.) thus up to (o(2),

mn = i
p (0)

(in the expression for q(0)

we nd that the green-schwarz action for the massive type iia string is given by

lmassive

2

= l2  i

4 m ix  jx  e  (

h hij  ij 11)    ,

where l2 is given in (2.8), but with the eld strengths now given by

f(4) = da(3) + a(1)  da(2) + 1

f(3) = da(2) ,

2 m a(2)  a(2) .

(4.4)

(4.5)

it is often more appropriate to use a formalism where the mass term of the iia theory,

which can be thought of as a 0-form eld strength, is replaced by its dual 10-form eld

strength. in this case the action will be given instead by

5 massless/massive type iia t-duality

in the previous section, we derived the t-duality transformation between the type iia and

type iib green-schwarz actions. in particular, if the 0-form m vanishes, this relates the

massless type iia and type iib theories. when m is non-vanishing, the t-duality maps

from type iib to the massive type iia string theory. this t-duality has been discussed

in refs [10, 13, 11, 12] at the level of the low-energy eective action, by considering the

scherk-schwarz reduction of type iib supergravity. this leads to the expectation that there

should be a t-duality that directly relates the massless and massive type iia string theories.

this issue was explored in [14], by considering the t-duality between the d8-brane and the

d6-brane in eight dimensions. since the d6-brane in d = 8 has, from an eleven-dimensional

point of view, the internal structure of either a circle bundle over a 2-torus [20] or a 2-torus

bundle over a circle [14], this would provide a geometrical relation between m-theory and

the massive type iia string.

here, we shall consider the t-duality relations between the massive and massless type

iia strings in detail, making use of the results of the previous sections. in particular, we
have seen that the results of t-duality transformations on the string variables (x , ) are

implemented on the background elds by means of standard nonlinear supergravity global

symmetry transformations. this would then also imply that a t-duality map between

an original massless string theory (with an appropriate non-trivial r-r background) and

the corresponding image massive theory will similarly be implemented by a background-

eld transformation that can be read o from previous work on eective eld theories. in

particular, for the purposes of the present discussion we shall consider string theories on

backgrounds with two isometries, which are related to previous work on d = 8 eective

supergravities.

accordingly, let us consider massless type iia string theory on a background with two

u (1) isometries, namely where all spacetime elds are independent of two spacetime coor-
dinates y a, a = 1, 2. dening v a

i = iy a, we introduce the lagrange multiplier term

l = l0 + ijizav a
j .

(5.1)

next, we integrate out the two v a

i . two possible cases arise, according to whether or not the
2-form eld strength f(2) with indices projected into the compactied directions vanishes.

these two cases correspond to massless or massive string backgrounds respectively.

consider rst the massless case. after performing a t-duality transformation by inte-

grating out the two v a

i , the lagrangian can once again be put into the form of the type iia

17

massless string action, but with background elds now subjected to a transformation which

can be identied as one of the perturbative symmetries of the d = 8 eective supergravity

theory. after a nal relabelling of the lagrange multipliers (z1 = ey 2, z2 = ey 1), this
double t-duality transformation corresponds to an inversion and interchange of the two
toroidal radii; r1  1/r2 and r2  1/r1. unlike the situation where one performs
a t-duality inversion on just a single circle, which maps the type iia theory into the iib
theory,8 this double t-duality inversion maps the type iia theory back into itself. in other

words, the transformed theory can still be lifted up to the type iia massless string action

in d = 10, so this constitutes a genuine element of the symmetry group of the type iia

string.

as with the single-inversion t-duality discussed in section 3, the eect of the double-

inversion t-duality on the background elds is identical to a standard transformation of the

corresponding lower-dimensional eective eld theory. in the single-inversion case, this was

the well-known redenition (not a symmetry) that relates the elds of the type iia and type

iib forms of nine-dimensional supergravity. in the double-inversion case, the corresponding

eld-theory transformation is a symmetry of the eight-dimensional supergravity, which is
contained in the perturbative t-duality so(2, 2) subgroup of the sl(3, ir)  sl(2, ir)
cremmer-julia symmetry of maximal eight-dimensional supergravity.9

before we identify which d = 8 supergravity symmetry transformation the t-duality

transformation produces, let us recall the structure of the t-duality symmetry group. the

perturbative t-duality group that arises for spacetimes with the isometries of a d-torus is

so(d, d). this is a subgroup of the cremmer-julia supergravity symmetry group for the

eective eld theory obtained by dimensionally reducing from d = 10 on such a torus; in
the case of d = 8 maximal supergravity, the cremmer-julia symmetry group is sl(3, ir)
sl(2, ir). the corresponding so(2, 2) perturbative symmetry is isomorphic to sl(2, ir)1
sl(2, ir)2, where the sl(2, ir)2 factor is the second factor in the cremmer-julia group and

the sl(2, ir)1 factor is a subgroup of the cremmer-julia sl(3, ir). sl(2, ir)1 has its

origin in general coordinate transformations of the 2-torus. in fact, the full residuum of

8note that in the case of bosonic or type i strings, this single-inversion transformation is a symmetry,

and it enlarges the total t-duality group from so(2, 2) to o(2, 2). see [21] for a recent discussion, at the

level of supergravity action, of how r-r potentials transform under the so(d, d) group.

9since we shall be discussing symmetry groups both in their continuous forms at the level of the eective

eld theories, and in their discretised forms in the string theories, we shall tend to refer to them always in

their continuous forms, with their discretisations to integer coecients in the string-theory context being

understood.

18

the internal general coordinate transformations is gl(2, ir)  ir  sl(2, ir), but the
ir factor becomes part of sl(2, ir)2. the remaining two sl(2, ir)2 generators arise from

an o(2) transformation independent of the general-coordinate gl(2, ir) and from constant

shifts of the axion  = a(0) that comes from the internal components of the ns-ns 2-form

in d = 10. (see, for example, [22] for a discussion of o(d, d) t-duality for string actions on

nontrivial nsr backgrounds.)

now we shall identify which so(2, 2) transformation has been generated by the double-

inversion t-duality. specically, we shall show that it is the element of the sl(2, ir)2 factor

represented by the matrix

 =  0
1

1

0! .

(5.2)

to see how this works, let us consider the double-inversion t-duality transformation

in detail. we already saw in section 3 that the usual presentation of the single-inversion

t-duality transformation leads to rather opaque transformation rules of the form (3.5),

which assume the more elegant form (3.8) when the ten-dimensional elds are decomposed

in terms of nine-dimensional elds in a geometrically-natural way. specically, it is the

standard kaluza-klein ansatz that provides this natural framework for this decomposition.

this advantage becomes all the more persuasive in the present context, where we wish to

implement the double-inversion t-duality transformation corresponding to integrating out
both of the auxiliary elds v a
i

in (5.1). thus we begin by writing the ten-dimensional string

metric in the kaluza-klein decomposition appropriate to the assumed form where there are

two u (1) isometries on a 2-torus:

ds2

10 = ds2

8 + ef + (dy 1 + a1

(1) + a1

(0)2 dy 2)2 + ef (dy 2 + a2

(1))2 ,

(5.3)

where all elds are independent of the two toroidal coordinates (y 1, y 2), and we have

dened

f   1

2   3
27

1 q 3

7 2 ,

  27

1 q 3

7 2 .

(5.4)

here, 1 and 2 are the usual dilatonic scalars coming from the reduction steps to d = 9

and d = 8 respectively. as we shall see, the combination f will be the canonically-

normalised dilaton in the sl(2, ir)/o(2) scalar coset describing the sl(2, ir)2 global sym-

metry. the combination , also canonically normalised, is orthogonal to f and lives in the

sl(3, ir)/o(3) part of the total scalar manifold. we also make a standard kaluza-klein

decomposition for the 2-form potential a:

a(2) = a(2) + a(1)a  dy a +  dy 1  dy 2 .

(5.5)

19

in fact  will turn out to be the axion in the sl(2, ir)2/o(2) scalar coset.

we are now ready to implement the double-inversion t-duality transformation. thus

we begin with the sigma-model lagrangian



l0 =  1

2

h hij ix  jx  g + 1

2 ij ix  jx  a ,

(5.6)

and make the assumption that all elds are independent of y a = (y 1, y 2), where we
decompose the coordinates as x  = (x , y a). then replacing iy a by v a
lagrange multiplier term as in (5.1), and integrating out the two v a

i , adding the
i , we arrive at a t-duality
transformed lagrangian which again has the same general form as (5.6), with (z1, z2) now

playing the roles of the two toroidal coordinates. in fact, it is natural to relabel these in

terms of two tilded coordinates ey a, according to the rule z1 = ey 2, z2 = ey 1. as we

indicated above, at the intermediate stages of the calculation the results are cumbersome.

however, they become rather simple when expressed in terms of the elds appearing in the

kaluza-klein decomposition, and we shall present only these nal results here. to do so, it

is useful rst to make the following redenitions:

(1)  a1

(1) = a1

a1
a(1)2 = a(1)2  a1

(0)2 a2
(1) ,
 ,

(1)

a(1)1 = a(1)1 + a2
(1) ,
  a2
(1) .

a(2) = a(2)  a1

(1)

(5.7)

after the double-inverse t-duality transformation, we nd that the sigma-model la-

grangian can be recast in the form (5.6), using tilded elds which are related to the original

untilded ones as follows. first of all, in the scalar sector we nd

e f =

ef



(0)2 .

e2f + 2 ,

e =

this shows that the dilaton f and the axion  have transformed under precisely the sl(2, ir)

matrix  given in (5.2), where  =   a b

 = (a + b)/(c + d) on    + i ef . on the other hand the other dilatonic scalar
combination , and the axion a1
(0)2 associated with sl(2, ir)1, are inert. we nd that the
remaining elds are transformed in the following way:

the transformations (5.8) and (5.9) describe a symmetry of the truncation of the eight-

dimensional supergravity to its ns-ns sector. in fact, when appropriately augmented by

transformations for the r-r elds, it is a symmetry of the full theory (see the appendix for

a complete discussion); as we discussed above, it is the z2 subgroup of the sl(2, ir)2 factor

of the t-duality symmetry given in (5.2).

so far, we have demonstrated the massless/massive type iia t-duality at the level of

the ns-ns background elds, in what is a rather natural generalisation of the standard

discussion for iia/iib duality. since we are working in the green-schwarz formalism, this

string-theoretic derivation of massless/massive iia t-duality can be extended to the r-r

sector too, as we did for iia/iib t-duality in section 3. to do this, we again start from a
generic lagrangian of the form (3.1), with g and b containing o(2) terms q and
p as in (3.2), together also with the terms gj and bj containing the j at o(2).
following the lessons learned in section 3.1, where we saw that the relations between the
lower-dimensional components of the original and the t-duality transformed o(2) tensors

are much simpler if written in terms of tangent-space indices, we follow the same strategy

here. after algebra of considerable complexity, we arrive at the following expressions for
the tilded o(2) backgrounds in terms of the original ones:

egim = gim ,

ebim = bim ,

(5.10)

f eq = p12 +  ef q ,

2 ( f +f )(cid:16)ab gib +  ef bia(cid:17) ,

ebia = e 1

epmn = pmn ,

eqmn = qmn ,
eqma = e 1
epma = e 1
eq12 = q12 ,
eq +e e
egia = e 1

2 ( f +f )(cid:16)  ab pmb +  ef qma(cid:17) ,
2 ( f +f )(cid:16)  ab qmb +  ef pma(cid:17) ,
eq11  eq22 = q11  q22 ,
f ep12 = q   ef p12 ,
ep12  e e
2 ( f +f )(cid:16)ab bib +  ef gia(cid:17) ,

our notation here is that m denotes a tangent-space index restricted to the eight-dimensional

subspace, and a and b denote tangent-space indices ranging over the two values correspond-

ing to the directions of the two u (1) isometries. the explicit numerical indices 1 and

2 similarly denote these two tangent-space index values. the quantity q is dened by
q  1

2 (q11 + q22), and likewise eq  1

2 (eq11 + eq22).

in the appendix, we derive the complete sl(2, ir) transformations of the ns-ns and

r-r elds of the eight-dimensional supergravity.

in the ns-ns sector, the z2 subgroup

21

corresponding to (5.2) coincides precisely with the t-duality relations that we derived in

(5.8) and (5.9) by string-theoretic methods. we have veried that this is also true in the

r-r sector, namely that z2 transformations of the r-r elds agree with the transforma-
tions that follow from the o(2) relations (5.10). to demonstrate this, one has to follow

steps analogous to those that we presented for the case of type iia/iib t-duality in sec-

tion 3.2. note that the fermionic coordinates  also undergo a transformation under the
1
double t-duality, with  = e 1
2 f . this corresponds to
a compensating transformation in the o(2) denominator subgroup of the sl(2, ir)2/o(2)

coset.

now let us consider the case where f(0)12 = m is allowed to be a non-vanishing part of the

background for the massless type iia theory. (this corresponds, at the level of the eective

eld theory, to a scherk-schwarz reduction of the axion a(0)1 in d = 9 that comes from the
r-r 1-form a(1) in d = 10.) after integrating over the two v a

i auxiliary elds in (5.1), the
resulting lagrangian no longer allows a direct interpretation as a dimensional reduction of

the massless ten-dimensional type iia string. by this we mean that, unlike in the f(0)12 = 0

discussion above, the tilded backgrounds of the t-duality transformed theory cannot be

ansatz. for example, the tilded 1-forms eaa

arising after integrating over the two v a

directly interpreted as the elds appearing in the given kaluza-klein dimensional-reduction
~ ,
i , which in the f(0)12 = 0 case could respectively be
interpreted as the kaluza-klein vectors, winding vectors and dilatons in the kaluza-klein
reduction ansatz for the type iia theory, cannot be so interpreted once f(0)12 = m 6= 0.

(1) and ea(1)a, and the tilded dilatonic scalars

the reason why this has happened is that the sl(2, ir)2 symmetry is broken by the
cosmological potential that arises in the scherk-schwarz reduction with f(0)12 = m 6= 0 [13].
the full lagrangian is given in the appendix; here, we shall just consider the relevant terms

in order to illustrate the point. the cosmological term, together with the kinetic terms for

the scalars of the sl(2, ir)2/o(2) coset, is given by

l =  1

(5.11)

(5.12)

is the third linear combination of the three dilatonic scalars; it is canonically normalised

and is orthogonal to f and to  dened in (5.4). we can think of the cosmological term

as being the kinetic term for the 0-form eld strength f(0)12 = m. the key point that

distinguishes this from the case when m = 0 is that whereas all the other eld strengths are

22

either invariant under sl(2, ir)2 or else they occur in doublet pairs, here we have a single

term which is not invariant under sl(2, ir)2, thus breaking the symmetry. nonetheless, we

can still view sl(2, ir)2 as dening a set of eld redenitions, albeit ones that now change

the form of the lagrangian. in particular, it is easy to see that for a general sl(2, ir)2

transformation of the backgrounds, for which

the lagrangian (5.11) transforms into

it is clear that this is dierent from the original form of the lagrangian (5.11), showing

that the mass term breaks not only the general sl(2, ir)2 symmetry but also the specic

z2 subgroup corresponding to the double-inversion t-duality (5.2). however, the t-duality

transformed backgrounds do still allow themselves to be directly lifted to a covariant theory

in d = 10, but now it is to the massive iia theory, rather than to the massless theory. in

other words we can directly interpret eaa

vectors, and ~ as the dilatons coming from the reduction ansatz for the massive iia theory.
in particular, we can see this from the form of the cosmological term in (5.16). from the

(1) as the kaluza-klein vectors, ea(1)a as the winding

denitions of f and , we see that the cosmological term is

(5.17)

which is precisely what one obtains by performing a kaluza-klein reduction of the cos-

(5.16) can also be understood from this viewpoint, since it is nothing but the kaluza-klein

reduction of the mass term for the 2-form a(2) in the ten-dimensional massive iia theory.

6 conclusions

in this paper we studied the t-duality maps involving the type iia and type iib string

theories at the level of the green-schwarz sigma-model string actions. this approach pro-

vides a string-theoretical derivation of t-dualities, and sheds light on the subsequent web

of dualities between the massless and massive type iia and type iib string theories.

as a prerequisite for these analyses, we needed explicit (component) forms of the green-

schwarz actions, in backgrounds including r-r as well as ns-ns massless elds. while the

supereld form of the type iia action in curved backgrounds has been given in [23], the

component form, needed for the application of t-duality transformations, was unknown.

the component form of the analogous type iib green-schwarz action was also previously

unknown. in our derivation of the type iia green-schwarz action, we employed a double

dimensional reduction of the eleven-dimensional supermembrane action, and making use of

explicit results for the supervielbein and 3-form superpotential, derived up to order 2 in

the fermionic elds [7]. this enabled us to nd an explicit and complete form of the type

iia green-schwarz action with massless ns-ns and r-r background elds, exact up to
order 2.

this action provided our starting point for studying t-duality transformations at the

level of the green-schwarz action. we generalised buschers t-duality procedure (imple-

mented in [18] in an nsr formalism with only ns-ns background elds) to the green-

schwarz action, now involving spinor coordinates  as well as r-r background elds. fur-

thermore, we formulated the t-duality transformation rules in terms of adapted background-

eld parametrizations, thus obtaining more compact and elegant expressions for the t-

duality maps which have a natural geometrical interpretation.

these generalised t-duality transformations enabled us in turn to derive the green-

schwarz action for the type iib string, giving it for the rst time with ns-ns and r-r

background elds, exact up to o(2).

next, we constructed the string-theoretical t-duality map between the type iib and

massive type iia strings. starting with the type iib green-schwarz action, in a background

with a u (1) isometry in which the 1-form eld strength f(1) = d is allowed to take a non-

vanishing constant value in the direction of the isometry, and applying the generalised

t-duality transformation, we derived the green-schwarz action for the massive iia string,
in arbitrary r-r and ns-ns maslles backgrounds, again to order 2. this provides a string

theoretical derivation of the t-duality transformation which, at the level of the eective

supergravities, corresponds to the equivalence of the scherk-schwarz reduced type iib and

24

massive type iia theories.

in view of the fact that the type iib string is itself related by t-duality to the massless

type iia string, one can obtain a direct t-duality relation between the massless and mas-

sive type iia strings, by considering them on backgrounds with the two u (1) isometries

of a 2-torus. this was discussed by considering d8-branes and d6-branes in the eective

eld theories in [14]; here, we were able to give a string-theoretic description at the level of

t-duality in the green-schwarz actions. in addition, we gave a construction of the eight-
dimensional sl(3, ir)  sl(2, ir) invariant supergravity eective action that includes the
two mass parameters m1,2, forming a doublet under the sl(2, ir) factor. this can be inter-

preted as a scherk-schwarz reduction of the type iib string on two circles of radii r1 and

r2 (introducing mass parameters m1 and m2 respectively). the t-duality transformation

in turn relates this to the massive type iia string with one radius compactied on a regular

circle and another one scherk-schwarz reduced.

finally, we remark that our discussion of the t-duality mapping between the massless

and massive type iia strings extends straightforwardly, in a manner analogous to that

discussed in [14], to a unied picture in which the massive type iia string emerges in an

appropriate limit from the eleven-dimensional supermembrane propagating in a background
with the three u (1) isometries of a 3-torus, which can be viewed either as an s1 bundle
over t 2 [24] or as a t 2 bundle over s1 [14].

7 addendum

since writing this paper, and its publication in nucl. phys. b573 (2002) 149 and as v1.

of hep-th/9907202, we have discovered a small number of minor typographical errors. we

have also found that there were various infelicitous choices of convention and notation which,

although in no way incorrect, did not contribute positively to the elegance of the results.

we are therefore taking the opportunity, while correcting the minor typographical errors,

of improving some notation and conventions. we shall set out below what these changes

are. for clarity, we shall refer to the versions of this paper published in nucl. phys. b573

(2002) 149 and in v1. of hep-th/9907202 as the old versions, and this current version will

be called the new version.

there were two typographical errors in the old versions that aected our nal expressions

for the type iia and type iib lagrangians respectively. in the type iia lagrangian (2.8), a

11 matrix was accidentally omitted from the f terms. in the type iib lagrangian (3.28),

25

the term involving i ij (


2

1

 dj 1

2



 dj 2) was accidentally written as ij (

1

 dj 1 +

 dj 2). both errors are corrected in this new version.
turning now to the question of conventions, we found that there were two convention

choices in the old versions of this paper that were not helpful to the interpretation of our

results.

firstly, our starting point of the supermembrane action in [7] is written using a conven-

tion in which the conjugation of spinors involves the introduction of a factor of i; i.e. the
conjugate of a spinor  is written as  = i  t, where t denotes the dirac matrix in the
time direction. this has the consequence that, for example, the hermitean dirac action is
written as   d  rather than the more familiar i   d . to readjust to conventions
that are more familiar, we have therefore implemented the replacement of every occurrence

of a conjugate spinor by i times the conjugate spinor in all formula in the old versions of

this paper. thus we have replaced

old version  i new version ,

(7.1)

et cetera.

a second inconvenience in our conventions was that when dening the two chiral spinors
(1, 2) of the type iib theory in terms of the spinor  of type iia that has chiral and
antichiral projections (1, 2), we dened 2 as i 0 2, rather than as 0 2 as we are
now doing in the this new version of the paper, in equation (3.12). (recall that 0 is the

dirac matrix in the circle reduction direcion, not the time direction.) again, there was

nothing incorrect about the denition used in the old versions of the paper, but it had

the consequence that the two chiral spinors of type iib were majorana and anti-majorana

respectively. this led to expressions, such as the old versions of the type iib lagrangian

context.

(3.28), which although perfectly correct, were somewhat misleading if not set in proper
in this new version, where we dene 2 = 0 2, the two chiral spinors of the
type iib theory are both majorana. this change of convention amounts to making the
replacement of 2 in the old versions of the paper by i 2, and of
the expressions we are using in this new version.

appendix

a massless/massive iia t-duality from d = 8 massive su-

pergravity

in this appendix, we discuss the massless/massive iia t-duality at the level of supergravity.

in order to make explicit the t-duality transformation that directly maps between the

massless and massive type iia theories, we shall consider a scherk-schwarz dimensional

reduction of the massive type iia supergravity, in which the 2-form eld strength f(2) in

d = 10 is allowed to be non-vanishing in the internal directions of the 2-torus. thus

in addition to the mass parameter m1 of the original massive iia theory, we shall also

introduce a second mass parameter m2 via the scherk-schwarz reduction to d = 8. when

m2 = 0, the d = 8 theory is the standard two-torus reduction of massive type iia, whilst

when m1 = 0, the resuting theory is the scherk-schwarz reduction of massless type iia or

m-theory to d = 8.

our goal is to show that the m1 = 0 or m2 = 0 cases are in fact the same theory,

by giving the explicit transformations of the elds that map one theory to the other. to

do so, we shall explicitly exhibit the symmetry of the resulting eight-dimensional theory
under the sl(2, ir) factor of the sl(3, ir)  sl(2, ir) cremmer-julia group, under which
(we can really think of m1 and m2 as being elds,
(m1, m2) transform as a doublet.

rather than just parameters; see, for example, [12].) in particular, this sl(2, ir) symmetry

has a z2 subgroup that maps from the case where m1 = 0 with m2 non-vanishing to the

case where m2 = 0 with m1 non-vanishing. this subgroup, which is the one we found

by performing the double-inversion t-duality transformation (5.2) in section 5, is thus a

symmetry that manifestly relates the scherk-schwarz reduction of the massless type iia

theory to the ordinary reduction of the massive type iia theory, in eight dimensions. this

then completes the demonstration of the massless/massive type iia t-duality.

in d = 10, the massive type iia theory [9] is given by

f(3) = d a(2) ,
2 m1 a(2)  a(2) .

(a.2)

we now reduce on t 2 the standard way, using the conventions and notation of [19], adapted

to the case where the rst reduction step is from d = 10 to d = 9, and where the generalised

scherk-schwarz reduction is included. to be explicit, we have

a(1) = a(1) + a(0) dz  m2 z2 dz1 ,
a(2) = a(2) + a(1)  dz + a(0)12 dz1  dz2 ,
a(4) = a(3) + a(2)  dz + a(1)12  dz1  dz2 + a1  a(2) .

(a.3)

note that the last term in a(4), which amounts to a eld redenition, is needed in order
that the coordinate z2 does not appear undierentiated in the lagrangian. the ansatz for
the einstein-frame metric is e/2 ds2

(a.7)

in the scalar sector, the sl(2, ir) symmetry is generated by the axion   a(0)12, and
the dilaton combination f , given by (5.4), which arises in the exponential prefactor for the

axions kinetic term in d = 8. to make the sl(2, ir) manifest, it is useful to perform a

number of redenitions of the dimensionally-reduced potentials. these are given below, in

equation (a.17). expressed in terms of the now-redened potentials, we obtain the following

expressions for the various eld strengths in d = 8. firstly, we have

(a.13)

each pair is a doublet under the sl(2, ir).

finally, we have the 4-form. this turns out to be

(a.14)

this, together with its hodge dual, forms a doublet under the sl(2, ir). the symmetry

involving f(4) is therefore seen only at the level of the eld equations.

it is useful at this stage to consider the various doublet symmetries under the sl(2, ir)

generated by f and  in more detail. first of all, we note from (a.4) that, as one would

expect, f does not couple to the kinetic terms for any of the sl(2, ir)-singlet elds. all the
doublet pairs of 2-form elds strengths (f+, f), with potentials (a+, a) = (a(1), a(1)12),
(a2
(1), a(1)1) and (a1
(1), a(1)2), which we exhibited above, have kinetic terms which couple
to f in the form  1
2 ef f 2
2 ef (f +  f+)2. under sl(2, ir) transformations acting
on  =  + i ef via the fractional linear mapping   (a  + b)/(c  + d), the potentials
(a+, a) transform as

(a.15)

the two mass parameters (m1, m2) transform in the same way as (a+, a). finally, to
discuss the sl(2, ir) symmetry for f(4), we note that the pair f(4) and (ef f(4) +  f(4))
transform like the upper and lower components of a doublet, as in (a.15). since this involves

the 4-form and its dual, the sl(2, ir) symmetry is realised here at the level of the equations

of motion rather than the lagrangian. the the bianchi identity and the equation of motion

for the 4-form are given by

df(4) = x ,

d(ef f(4) +  f(4)) = d1 ,

(a.16)

where x can be easily read o from (a.14). it is straightforward to verify that these two

equations form a doublet under the sl(2, ir).

for completeness, we list the eld redenitions that we made for the potentials. making

the following substitutions in the expressions for the eld strengths directly following from

30

the dimensional reduction, we obtain the eld strengths given above:

(a.17)

to summarise the appendix, we have constructed a manifestly sl(3, ir)  sl(2, ir)
invariant massive supergravity in d = 8, with two mass parameters m1 and m2 which

form a doublet under the sl(2, ir) factor. when m2 = 0 with m1 non-vanishing, the

theory is the standard kaluza-klein 2-torus reduction of the massive type iia theory in

d = 10. on the other hand when m1 = 0 with m2 non-vanishing, the theory comes from the

the scherk-schwarz reduction of massless type iia (or m-theory). the manifest sl(2, ir)

symmetry implies in particular that these two eight-dimensional cases are equivalent. in

particular, as we observed in section 5, the discrete transformation that maps (m1, 0) to
(0, m2), associated with the massive/massless type iia theories, interchanges r1  1/r2.
it is quite dierent from the r1  1/r1 zz2
this zz2 is a subgroup of the sl(2, ir);
transformation that relates the type iia and type iib theories, which is intrinsically discrete

and is not part of any connected group.

as was observed in [24], the u-duality group can be decomposed as general coordinate

transformations of the internal spaces of either the type iia or the type iib theories,

together with the t-duality transformation that maps between the two theories. from the

type iib point of view, the sl(2, ir) symmetry under which (m1, m2) form a doublet is

nothing but a residual general coordinate transformation symmetry of the internal 2-torus.

this is because in the type iib case, the axion  in d = 10 can be scherk-schwarz reduced

on each of the two circles reductions, giving rise to two mass parameters that naturally form

a doublet under the sl(2, ir) residuum of the 2-torus general coordinate transformations.

note added

after this work was completed, a paper appeared which also considers certain aspects of

type iia/iib t-duality for r-r elds [25].
