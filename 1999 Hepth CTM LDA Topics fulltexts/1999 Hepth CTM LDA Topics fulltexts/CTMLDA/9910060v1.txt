abstract

we describe the construction of quantum gravity, i.e. of a theory of self-interacting mass-

less spin-2 quantum gauge elds, the gravitons, on at space-time, in the framework of

the perturbative causal renormalization scheme. this approach leads to very satisfactory

results in pure quantum gravity calculations up to second order perturbation theory. the

extensions to scalar and vector matter eld couplings are also achieved and uv-nite and

cuto-free results are obtained at the one-loop level. the explicit construction of the fock

space for the graviton eld is carried out and a simple formula which characterizes the

physical subspace is given. this characterization of the physical subspace is necessary in

order to prove the unitarity of the theory. the quantization of the ghost vector elds,

necessary for having a gauge invariant theory, is also discussed.

introduction

the central aspect of this work is the construction of the s-matrix for gravity by means of

causality in the quantum eld theoretical (qft) framework. this idea goes back to stuckelberg,

bogoliubov and shirkov and the program was carried out successfully by epstein and glaser [1]

for scalar eld theories and subsequently applied to qed by scharf [2] and to non-abelian

gauge theories by dutsch et al. [3, 4, 5]. we now apply this scheme to quantum gravity

(qg), by which we mean a qft of self-interacting massless spin-2 quantum gauge elds on

at space-time. for this non-geometrical approach, see [6, 7, 8]. for our purpose, namely the

implementation of qg as a poincare covariant local quantum eld theory with a considerable

gauge arbitrariness, two main tools will be used: the epstein-glaser inductive construction of

the perturbation series for the s-matrix with the related causal renormalization scheme [1, 2]

and perturbative quantum gauge invariance [5, 9]. the rst method provides an elegant way

of dealing with the uv problem of qg and the second one ensures gauge invariance at the

quantum level, formulated by means of the gauge charge q, in each order of perturbation

theory. a detailed exposition of what follows will be the subject of the forthcoming ph. d.

thesis by the author. a short presentation can be found in [12].

1 causal perturbation theory

in this section we give a concise review of the causal approach to qft. we consider the

s-matrix, being a formal power series in the coupling constant, as a sum of smeared operator-

valued distributions of the following form [1, 2]:

s(g) = 1 +



xn=1

1

n!z d4x1 . . . d4xn tn(x1, . . . , xn) g(x1)  . . .  g(xn) ,

(1)

where g is a schwartz test function (g  s(r4)) which plays the role of adiabatic switching of the
interaction and provides a natural infrared cut o in the long-range part of the interaction. the

n-point operator-valued distributions tn are well-dened renormalized time-ordered products
and can be expressed in terms of wick monomials of free elds. they are constructed inductively

from the rst order t1(x), which plays the role of the usual interaction lagrangian in terms of
free elds, by means of poincare covariance and causality; the latter, if correctly incorporated,

2

leads directly to the renormalized perturbation series for the s-matrix which is uv-nite in

every order. the construction of tn requires some care: if it were simply given by the usual
time-ordering

tn(x1, . . . , xn) = t{t1(x1) . . . t1(xn)} = xn

(x0

(1)  x0

(2)) . . . (x0

(n1)  x0

(n)) 

(2)

 t1(x(1)) . . . t1(x(n)) ,

1 > x0

2 > . . . > x0

then uv-divergences would appear. if the arguments x1, . . . , xn are all time-ordered, i.e. if we
have x0
n, then tn is rigorously given by tn(x1, . . . , xn) = t1(x1) . . . t1(xn); since
tn has to be totally symmetric in x1, . . . , xn, we so obtain tn everywhere except for the complete
diagonal n = {x1 = x2 = . . . = xn}, i.e. except for the coincident points in conguration
space. the correct treatment of these points constitutes the key to control the uv-behaviour of

the n-point distributions. indeed, products of feynman propagators with coincident arguments

are the origin of the uv-divergences in loop graphs, because time-ordering cannot be done

simply by multiplying (singular) distributions by discontinuous -distributions, a procedure

which is usually ill-dened. the distributions must be carefully split into a retarded and an

advanced part for the tn to be well-dened and nite. let us illustrate how the inductive
construction of tn works by means of an example in which t2(x1, x2) for a massive scalar eld
(x) is constructed: we dene a qft by giving the equation of motion of the free quantum

eld, the covariant commutator rule and the interaction lagrangian t1 with coupling strength
g:

(cid:0) + m2(cid:1) (x) = 0 ,

where dm is the massive jordan-pauli distribution:

[(x1), (x2)] = idm(x1  x2) ,

t1(x) = ig : (x)3 : ,

(3)

dm(x) =

i

(2)3z d4p (p2  m2) sgn(p0) eipx .

in the next step we dene:

and carry out all the possible contractions using wicks lemma:

d2(x1, x2) :=(cid:2)t1(x1), t1(x2)(cid:3) ,
xk=1

: ok(x1, x2) : d[k]

2 (x1  x2) ,

d2 =

(4)

(5)

(6)

where : ok(x1, x2) : represents normally ordered products of free eld operators and d[k]
2 (x1x2)
are numerical distributions. expanding the result we can identify tree, loop and vacuum graph

contributions:

d2(x1, x2) =: (x1)(x1)(x2)(x2) : d[1]

2 (x1  x2)+ : (x1)(x2) : d[2]

2 (x1  x2) + d[3]

2 (x1  x2) ,

where the numerical distributions are given by

d[2]

d[3]

d[1]

2 (x1  x2) = 9ig2(cid:2)d(+)
2 (x1  x2) = 18g2(cid:2)d(+)
2 (x1  x2) = 6ig2(cid:2)d(+)

m (x1  x2)(cid:3) = 9ig2dm(x1  x2) ,
m (x1  x2)2(cid:3) ,

m (x1  x2) + d()
m (x1  x2)2  d()
m (x1  x2)3 + d()
2 (x))  v +(x)  v (x), with
the most important property of d2 is causality, i.e.
x := x1  x2. in order to obtain t2(x1, x2) we have to split the d2-distribution into a retarded
part, r2, and an advanced part, a2, with respect to the coincident point x = 0, so that
supp(r2(x))  v +(x) and supp(a2(x))  v (x). this splitting of the numerical distribution
d[k]
2 (x) must be accomplished according to the correct singular order (d[k]
2 ), which agrees here
with the usual power-counting degree of feyman diagrams, and describes the behaviour of
2 (x) near x = 0, or of d[k]
d[k]
2 (p) in the p   limit. if  < 0, then the splitting is trivial and
agrees with the standard time-ordering and we recover the feynman rules. if   0, then the
splitting is non-trivial and non-unique:

supp(d[j]

d[k]
2 (x)  r[k]

2 (x) +



x|a|=0

ca da (4)(x) ,

(7)

and the retarded part r[k]

2 (x) is best obtained in momentum space by means of dispersion-like

integrals (thus recovering the relation between causality and dispersion relation):

r[k]
2 (p) =

(t  i0)+1 (1  t + i0)

, p  v + .

(8)

eq. (7) contains a local normalization ambiguity: the cas are undetermined nite normalization
constants, which multiply terms with local support  (4)(x). this normalization freedom has
to be restricted by further physical conditions, e.g. gauge invariance in the case of gauge

4

theories or gravity. finally, t2 is given by

t2(x1, x2) = r2(x1, x2) + t1(x2)t1(x1) =

(10)

applying the described scheme to our example, we nd for the operator-valued distribution

t2(x1, x2), eq. (9), the expression:

t2(x1, x2) = + : (x1)(x1)(x1)(x2)(x2)(x2) : (g2)

+ : (x1)(x1)(x2)(x2) : t[1]

2 (x1  x2)tot

+ : (x1)(x2) : t[2]

2 (x1  x2)tot + t[2]

3 (x1  x2)tot .

the rst term represents the disconnected contribution coming from t1(x2)t1(x1) in eq. (9) by
using wicks lemma, the distribution in the second term t[1]
m(x1x2) is the
feynman propagator for the tree graph contribution, whereas the loop distribution t[2]
2 (x1x2)tot

2 (x1x2)tot = +9ig2df

is easily obtained in momentum space by means of eq. (8) and reads:

t[2]

.

the result of the evaluation of the above integral can be found in sec. 8. since (d[2]

2 ) = 0,
the splitting is not unique and we must take the local normalization term c0 into account. we
do not give here the expression for the vacuum graph contribution, the treatment of the latter

can be found in sec. 4 and in sec. 8. this inductive construction can be repeated for every

order of perturbation theory, although the complexity increases. the most delicate step is the

distribution splitting, which corresponds to a natural and mathematical well dened ultraviolet

regularization in the usual terminology. the advantages of the causal scheme are that it leads

directly to a renormalized perturbative expansion for the s-matrix without using a cuto,

it makes possible, to a given order in the coupling constant, to compute nite amplitudes for

various processes and it does not rely on the lagrangian approach.

5

2 quantization of gravity

for the causal construction we need the equation of motion of the free graviton after xing

the gauge, the commutation relation between free eld operators at dierent space-time points
and the rst-order graviton self-coupling t h
1 (x). since we are interested in a quantum theory
of einsteins general relativity, we therefore start from the hilbert-einstein lagrangian density

lhe written in terms of the goldberg variable g = gg and we expand it into a power

series in the coupling constant  = 32g, by introducing the graviton eld h dened through
h = g  , where  = diag(1,1,1,1) is the at space-time metric tensor:

lhe = 2

2

gr =



xj=0

jl(j)
he ;

(11)

he represents an interaction involving j + 2 gravitons. from this formulation of general

and l(j)
relativity we extract the ingredients for the perturbative construction of causal qg. we stress

however the fact that we consider the classical lagrangian density eq. (11) only as a source

of information about the elds, the couplings and the gauge which we work with: causal

perturbation theory does not rely on a quantum lagrangian with interacting elds. in a new

approach, which has been proposed in [9], one tries to construct the rst-order interaction

essentially by the requirement of perturbative quantum gauge invariance (see sec. 3 and sec. 10).
by considering the euler-lagrange variation of l(0)
, = 0
we obtain the equation of motion for the free graviton eld h(x) = 0, and we quantize it

he from eq. (11) in the hilbert-gauge h

covariantly by imposing the commutation rule

i

(cid:2)h(x), h(y)(cid:3) = 

2(cid:0) +   (cid:1) d0(x  y) =: i b d0(x  y) ,

where d0(x) is the massless jordan-pauli causal distribution. the rst order coupling among
gravitons, being linear in the coupling constant , can be derived from eq. (11) by taking the
normally ordered product of l(1)
he :
t h
1 (x) = i : l(1)

he(x) :

(12)



= i

2(cid:8) : h(x)h(x),h(x), : 
+ : h(x)h(x),h(x), : 2 : h(x)h(x),h(x), :(cid:9) .

for convenience of notation, h := h

 and all lorentz indices are written as superscripts whereas
the derivatives are written as subscripts. all indices occurring twice are contracted by the
minkowski metric  = diag(1,1,1,1). since the perturbative expansion for the s-
matrix is in powers of the coupling constant , we are allowed to take for the rst order cubic
interaction between gravitons only the contribution coming from l(1)
together with the inductive causal construction will automatically imply the introduction of the

he. then gauge invariance

quartic interaction between gravitons in second order at a purely quantum level [10], see sec.4.2;

if we were able to repeat this step in each order of perturbation theory, we would perhaps recover

the full einstein gravity in quantum form. at this point the somewhat articial decomposition

of the metric tensor into a at background and a dynamical variable would acquire a merely

book-keeping purpose beside the fact that we consider an asymptotically at situation.

3 perturbative quantum gauge invariance

the classical gauge transformations h  h + u, + u, u
,, which corresponds to the
linearized general covariance of g(x), can be implemented on a quantum level in the following

way by means of the gauge charge q:

(x) = eiqh(x)e+iq ,
h

q := zx0=const

d3x h(x),


x
0 u(x) .

q generates the innitesimal gauge variation of the asymptotic free graviton eld

where u are c-number elds satisfying u(x) = 0. formally, s-matrix gauge invariance:

dqh(x) :=(cid:2)q, h(x)(cid:3) = ibu(x), .

(14)

g1(cid:0)s(g)  s(g)(cid:1) = lim

(i [q, s(g)] + higher commutators) = 0

is reached, if we can show that the perturbative quantum gauge invariance  condition [3, 10,

5, 9]

t 
n/j(x1, . . . , xj, . . . , xn)

(17)

= sum of divergences ,

holds true for all n  1. already for n = 1, eq. (17) is non-trivial, because dqt h
1 (x) 6= div; this
requires the quantization of ghost and anti-ghost elds, u and u; these couple to the graviton

eld through the ghost coupling

[10, 11]:

t u

1 = i(cid:0)+ : u(x),h(x),u(x) :  : u(x),h(x)u(x), :
 : u(x),h(x)u(x), : + : u(x),h(x)u(x), :(cid:1) ,

which was derived in [13, 14]. the ghost elds (see sec.6) must be quantized as free fermionic

vector elds

(18)

(19)

(20)

(cid:8)u(x), u(y)(cid:9) = id0(x  y) ,

with innitesimal gauge variations dqu(x) = 0 and dq u(x) = ih(x),, so that we obtain

1 (x) + t u

 t 

1/1(x) = sum of divergences .

dq(cid:0)t h

1 (x)(cid:1) =: x

the fermionic quantization of the ghost elds is also necessary to have q nilpotent: q2 = 0.

the ghost elds, usually called faddeev-popov ghosts, are introduced in the causal construction

as a consequence of perturbative gauge invariance for n = 1 eq. (17).

in the path-integral

framework, the ghost elds appear as a consequence of the quantization after gauge xing [15],

but it was already noticed by feynman [6] that without ghost elds a unitarity breakdown

occurs in second order at the loop level.

4 pure quantum gravity in second order

before undertaking the examination of the various contributions in second order of perturbation

theory (tree, self-energy and vacuum graphs), we give the formula for the singular order of a

8

given graph which corresponds to the power-counting degree for feyman diagrams. the singular

order of the numerical distribution belonging to the graph g in the n-th order of perturbation

theory is:

(g)  4  b  gu  gu  d + n ,

(21)

where d is the number of derivatives on the external eld; b, gu, gu represent respectively the
number of graviton, ghost and anti-ghost external elds. the  means that in certain cases
the singular order is lowered by peculiar conditions, e.g. by the equations of motions of the free

elds. in the usual qft formulation, eq. (21) implies the non-renormalizability of qg, since

(g) increases without bound for higher and higher orders in the perturbative expansion. this

means that there is a proliferation of divergences and of counterterms (one still has to hope

that the needed counterterms can be tted into the original lagrangian) to kill them. the hope

that qg was uv-nite to all orders failed after the two-loop calculation in [16, 17, 18], although

the one-loop order is uv-nite [19]. the situation is dierent in causal perturbation theory:

we are facing in this case a non-normalizable theory, i.e. each of its contributing diagrams

is nite due to the causal splitting method, but the number of the free, undetermined but

nite normalization constants increases with n. the problem is then to nd enough physical

conditions or requirements to x this increasing normalization freedom. as we will see in this

section, in second order the majority of the normalization terms can be chosen unambiguously.

4.1 graviton self-energy loop

we investigate the graviton self-energy contribution (graviton and ghost loops) in second order.

as in sec. 1, the inductive construction of t2(x1, x2) can be accomplished in two steps: in the
rst place we construct the following causal distribution from eq. (13) and (18) by applying

wick expansion with the contractions given by eq. (12)

dse

2 (x1, x2) =ht h+u

1

(x1), t h+u

1

(x2)i(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)se

=: h(x1)h(x2) : dse

2 (x1  x2) ,

(22)

because of translation invariance the c-number distribution dse
coordinate x = x1  x2. in momentum space we obtain for the self-energy tensor

2 depends only on the relative

dse
2 (p) = p (4)(p) (p2) sgn(p0)

(23)

9

where p (4)(p) is a covariant polynomial of degree 4:

p (4)(p) =

2

960(2)4(cid:20)  656 pppp  208 p2(cid:0)pp + pp(cid:1)
+ 162 p2(cid:0)pp + pp + pp + pp(cid:1)
 162 p4(cid:0) + (cid:1) + 118 p4(cid:21) .

(24)

then, in order to obtain t se

2 ) = 4,
obtained from eq. (21)or from direct inspection of eq. (24). thus, admitting free normalization
polynomial terms n 

(p), which correspond to local terms in x-space, we obtain

2 (x), according to the singular order (dse

2 (x1, x2), we split dse

2a

2 (x1, x2) =:h(x1)h(x2): i(x1  x2) ,

m 2

2a

apart from the tensorial structure, the scalar distribution t(p) = i
2 log ((p2 + i0)/m 2) is
calculated [4] from the massless causal scalar distribution d(p) = r(p)  a(p) = (p2) sgn(p0)
in eq. (23), by splitting it into d(p) = r(p)  a(p) and subtracting r(p) from r(p). to get a
condition for the undetermined normalization terms, we consider the sum of the proper self-

energy diagrams with an increasing number of self-energy insertions. by requiring that the mass

of the graviton (which is zero) and the coupling constant  remain unchanged after the sum of

these diagrams, we nd that all normalization terms must vanish, except for the term of degree
4 which can be absorbed in the new parameter m 2. we emphasize the fact that, in virtue of

the causal splitting prescription, all expressions are uv-nite and eq. (26) agrees exactly with

the nite part obtained using ad-hoc regularization schemes [21, 22]. as a consequence it is

not necessary to add counterterms [19] to the original lagrangian in order to renormalize the

theory. besides, the graviton self-energy eq. (26) satises the slavnov-ward identity for the

2-point connected green function [21, 22]

pp(cid:8)b(cid:2) se,grav.(p) + se,ghost(p)(cid:3)b(cid:9) = 0 ,

(27)

only if ghost and graviton loops are taken into account, as well as perturbative gauge invariance,
2 (x1, x2) = sum of divergences. the result of eq. (26) can also be used to nd
eq. (17): dqt se
the long range, low energy quantum correction to the newtonian potential between to bodies

10

of mass m1 and m2 at a distance r in the non-relativistic static limit (see sec. 8 for the coupling
between matter and gravity). following [23, 24, 25], but without resorting to any eective

eld theoretical calculation, we nd that the logarithm depending term in eq. (26) gives the
r3-correction

v (r) = gm1m2

r

(cid:18)1 +

206

g 

c3  r2(cid:19) ,

(28)

where only graviton and ghost loops are taken into account. in sec. 8 and 9 , when we consider

also scalar massless matter and photons, we will nd supplementary corrections coming from

these massless particle loops.

4.2 tree graph sector

for the tree graphs we quote briey the result of schorn [10, 11]: perturbative gauge invariance

in second order, eq. (17), generates the 4-graviton coupling. since

dqt tree

2

(x1, x2) 6= divergence ,

(29)

because of the appearing of local anomalies [3, 5] which cannot be recast into a divergence, we
take advantage of the normalization freedom of tree diagrams with singular order   0 by
choosing local normalization terms n tree

(x1, x2), so that

2

dqt tree

2

(x1, x2) + dqn tree

2

(x1, x2) = divergence .

(30)

the nice result is that n2(x1, x2) agrees exactly with the next term in the expansion of the
hilbert-einstein lagrangian eq. (11): n2(x1, x2) = i2 : l(2)
he(x1) : (x1  x2). such a property
was already observed in yang-mills theories [3]: starting with an interaction between three

gauge elds, perturbative gauge invariance generates automatically the 4-gauge elds coupling.

since qg is constructed starting from a non-polynomial lagrangian, it is not clear if this scheme

would also work in higher orders: does perturbative gauge invariance in n-th order require the

introduction of local terms which turn out to agree with the n+1 term in the expansion of the

einstein-hilbert lagrangian ?

11

4.3 vacuum graphs

we discuss also the vacuum graphs in second order:

in the causal perturbation theory they

cannot be divided away as in the gell-mann and low series for connected green functions,

but this is not a problem because they are nite as a consequence of the causal scheme. the

corresponding t2 distribution has singular order  = 6 and reads

(2)8  37

p6 log(cid:18)(p2 + i0)

it is possible to prove the free vacuum stability in qg [26]:

limg1(cid:0), s(g)(cid:1) = 1, where 
is the fock vacuum of free asymptotic elds, perturbatively this means limg1(cid:0), sn(g)(cid:1) =

g0  s(r4) with g0(0) = 1. for n = 2 we get:

as a consequence of the bad uv behaviour of qg ( t v g
(p)  p6). at the same time, free
vacuum stability forces the free normalization constants ci to vanish. this allows the graviton
to show up as an asymptotic particle.

5 the physical subspace fphys

an interesting feature of this approach to qg is the possible construction of the physical hilbert

space for the asymptotic graviton eld. in order to decouple the ghosts and the unphysical

degrees of freedom of the graviton from the truly physical degrees of freedom in the theory, we

could apply the gupta-bleuler [27] formalism with indenite metric, but we prefer to realize
the free eld representations on a fock space f with positive denite metric [28]. lorentz
covariance requires then the introduction of the krein structure [29, 30] in f and we can dene
the physical subspace fphys as in [28, 30] by:

fphys := ker(cid:8)q, q(cid:9) .

(33)

in order to verify this formula, we need an explicit representation of the free elds appearing

in the theory. since a symmetric tensor eld with arbitrary trace transforms under the proper

12

lorentz group l
decompose h(x) according to the irreducible reduction of the representations

+ according to the tensor product of two spinor representations d(1/2,1/2), we

into

d(1/2,1/2)  d(1/2,1/2)|sym = d(1,1)  d(0,0) ,

h(x) = h (x) +

1
4

(x)

(34)

(35)

where h (x) represents a traceless symmetric tensor eld dened as h (x) := h(x) 
h(x)/4 with h 
 = . from

 = 0 (9 degrees of freedom) and (x) a scalar eld with h

eq. (12) we obtain the following commutation relations:

(cid:2)h (x), h (y)(cid:3) = 

2(cid:0) +  

i

1
2

(cid:1) d0(x  y) =: i t d0(x  y) ,

(cid:2)(x), (y)(cid:3) = 4 i d0(x  y) ,

(cid:2)h (x), (y)(cid:3) = 0 .

we construct the fock space as the direct sum f = fh  f. for the quantization of h (x)
and (x) we choose the following free eld representations:

h (x) = (2)3/2z d3k
(x) = (2)3/2z d3k

2(cid:16)a(k)eikx + a(k)ke+ikx(cid:17) ,
2(cid:16)a(k)eikx + a(k)ke+ikx(cid:17) ,

(36)

where the krein adjunction k is dened by the krein operators h and  on fh and f
respectively:

(a)k = ha 

h ,

h =

3

oi=1

(1)n0i , n0i = 2z d3k a0i(k)a0i(k) ;

(a)k = a ,

 = (1)n , n =

1

4z d3k a(k)a(k) .

the elds are then k-selfadjoint and not -selfadjoint, but the eld components which spoil
the selfadjointness turn out to be the unphysical ones and therefore these will be absent in the

physical subspace fphys, so that on fphys one has h  k = h  . the absorption and creation

13

operators a = a , a  and a, a satisfy the canonical commutation relations

(cid:2)a(k), a(p)(cid:3) =

2(cid:0) +  

1

the t -tensor has the following values:

1
2

(cid:1) (3)(k  p) =: t (3)(k  p) ,

(37)

(38)

(cid:2)a(k), a(p)(cid:3) = 4 (3)(k  p) .

with i, j = 1, 2, 3; i 6= j. from this table we see that the t-tensor is neither diagonal nor
positive denite, although it is positive for the diagonal terms. in order to remedy these defects,

we dene new absorption operators:

a00 =

a11 =

a22 =

a33 =

(+a11 + a22 + a33) ,

(a11 + a22 + a33) ,
(+a11  a22 + a33) ,
(+a11 + a22  a33) ;

and analogously for the creation operators. then we obtain the commutation relations

(39)

(40)

(cid:2)aii(k), ajj(p)(cid:3) = ij (3)(k  k) .

note that the operators a00 and a00 do not appear here because this operator pair is superuous
due to the trace condition h 

 = 0: from the above denitions we get

ajj = a00 .

xj=1

now we want to specify the physical subspace with the help of the gauge charge q, eq. (15),

which now reads:

where b, c are absorption operators for the ghost elds (see sec. 6), and a

k represent the

absorption operator for the -longitudinal mode. eq. (43) tells us that (cid:8)q, q(cid:9) counts 8

degrees of freedom of the graviton: the a00-, 3 a0j-, 3 aj
k- and the scalar component a, as well
as the whole ghost sector, namely the 8 degrees of freedom for the 2 ghost vector elds. to
see this more clearly, let us choose a reference frame in which k = (, 0, 0, ), because these
unphysical components depend on k, substitute the as by the as, eq. (39), and consider

only the graviton sector. in this case the integrand on the right side of eq. (43) can be written

as

+ a01a01 + a02a02 + 2a03a03 + a13a13 + a23a23 +

22(cid:16)aa
where j := (a11  a22)/2, with (cid:2)j, j 

 and a12, in close analogy to the classical
only physical components are created from  by j 
reduction of the degrees of freedom in a plane gravitational wave. we nd therefore that

(cid:3) = 1 and (cid:2)j, j 

(cid:3) = 0. this means that the

a33a33

+j+(cid:17),

(44)

eq. (33) correctly denes the physical subspace. we can also study the hamilton operators
that generate the time evolutions for the free elds h (x) and (x):

i h (x) = [hh, h (x)] , i (x) = [h, (x)] ;

(45)

the hamilton operators can be readily obtained using eq. (38) and eq. (45):

if we restrict these operators to the physical subspace fphys and, in addition, we choose the

(46)

(cid:3) = 0. the four operators
a, a
 absorb or create physical states with helicities  2; these can also be described by
introducing polarization tensors. a dierent formulation of the graviton quantization can be

(cid:3) = 1 and (cid:2)a, a

found in [31].

6 the algebra of the ghost fields

in this section we present briey the quantization of ghost and anti-ghost vector elds. we

follow in our discussion the analysis of the scalar ghost elds carried out in [29]. here we are

dealing with vector ghost elds and we choose the following free eld representations:

u(x) = (2)3/2z d3p
u(x) = (2)3/2z d3p

2(cid:16) + b(p)eipx  c(p)eipx(cid:17) ,
2(cid:16)  c(p)eipx  b(p)eipx(cid:17) ;

(47)

which satisfy the covariant commutation rule eq. (19), whereas the absorption and creation

operators satisfy the commutation relations

(cid:8)c(p), c(k)(cid:9) =  (3)(p  k) ,
(cid:8)b(p), b(k)(cid:9) =  (3)(p  k) .

extending the conjugation  to the k-conjugation we obtain the most symmetric form

2(cid:16) + b(p)eipx + b(p)keipx(cid:17) ,
2(cid:16)  c(p)eipx + c(p)keipx(cid:17) ;
that implies (cid:0)u(cid:1)k
= u, or equivalently: (bi)k = ci, (ci)k = bi, (b0)k =
c0 and (c0)k = b0. the construction of the krein operator g on the ghost fock space

u(x) = (2)3/2z d3p
u(x) = (2)3/2z d3p
= u and (cid:0)u(cid:1)k

(48)

16

fg which generates the above transformations requires more work. let us dene the following
conserved currents

j
n (x) := i : u(x)

j
u (x) := i : u(x)



x u(x) :  ,


x u(x) :  ,

j
g (x) := i : u(x)

j
u (x) := i : u(x)



x u(x) :  ,


x u(x) :  ;

from these we can compute the ghost charges using the free eld representations eq. (47):

7 unitarity

the property of unitarity in qg, as in non-abelian gauge theories, is very important (and
usually very dicult to prove), because the fock space f contains a lot of unphysical states
(see sec. 5). nevertheless, there exists a physical subspace fphys, such that the s-matrix
restricted to fphys is unitary. unitarity does not hold on the whole fock space f because of
the unphysical degrees of freedom involved in the theory: since (cid:0)u(cid:1)k = u, (cid:0)u(cid:1)k = u,

h  k = h  and k = , the 1-point distribution is skew-k-conjugate:

1

(cid:0)t h+u

(x)(cid:1)k

= t h+u

1

(x) = t h+u

1

(x) ,

(50)

17

and this holds for all the n-point distributions tn by induction [30, 2] if the normalization
constants in the distribution splitting eq. (7) are chosen appropriately:

(51)
where x := {x1, . . . , xn} and tn(x) is the n-point distribution belonging to the perturbative
expansion of the inverse s-matrix. according to eq. (51), we get the pseudo-unitarity

tn(x)k = tn(x) ,

s(g)k = s(g)1 .

(52)

we cannot expect unitarity on the whole f because the scalar graviton , the 0i-components
of h  and the ghosts are not hermitian (with respect to ), but only skew-hermitian. with
unitarity on the physical subspace we mean the heuristic equation

pphyss(g)pphyss(g)pphys = pphys ,

lim
g1

(53)

where pphys stands for the projection operator from f onto fphys. we are able to prove the
perturbative version of eq. (53), namely:

t p
n (x) = pphystn(x)pphys + divergences ,

(54)

where t p
n (x) is the n-point distribution of the s-matrix inverted on pphys. the sum of diver-
gences appearing on the right side of eq. (54) does not harm, because the divergences can be
integrated out in the adiabatic limit g  1. we have
(cid:16)pphyss(g)pphys(cid:17)1

pphystn1(x1)pphys . . . pphystnr(xr)pphys

(55)

= pphys tn(x)pphys + div
= pphystn(x)kpphys + div
= pphystn(x)pphys + div .

in the rst step we have used the gauge invariance condition dqtn = div explicitly (see [28]
for the details of the proof), in the second step the denition of the perturbative expansion of
s(g)1, in the third step eq. (51), namely perturbative pseudo-unitarity and in the last step
the fact that the k-conjugation agrees with the -conjugation on fphys.

8 scalar matter coupled to quantum gravity

in this section we investigate qg coupled to matter eld. this will be modelled as a neu-
tral massive scalar eld (x) (also the massless limit will be investigated). expanding lm =

divergence, because the local anomaly of eq. (60) does not appear. this agrees with the fact
that for massless matter l(j)

(68)

the above calculation shows that, in our approach, qg coupled to scalar matter does not require

the introduction of a non-renormalizable counterterm [19, 20], i.e. of a counterterm that cannot

be absorbed in the redenitions of bare parameters appearing in the original lagrangian of the

theory. by means of the epstein and glaser construction we nd always nite and cuto-free

results. further gauge invariance as well as the slavnov-ward identity are satised:

the free graviton propagator h|t{h(x)h(y)}|i = i b df
due to vacuum polarization insertions.

0 (x  y) acquires corrections
if we require that the mass of the graviton and the

coupling constant remain unchanged, we nd for the graviton vacuum polarization tensor

to nd another condition for c2 one should consider the vertex correction as in qed [2]. in

9 abelian gauge fields coupled to quantum gravity

we discuss very briey the coupling between gravitons and u(1)-abelian gauge elds (pho-

tons). we expand the lagrangian lem = gffgg/4 in powers of the coupling

constant  and isolate the rst order coupling

in both cases, we nd uv-nite and cuto-free results for our one-loop calculations. therefore

the introduction of counterterms (that cannot be renormalized away, see [33, 34, 20]) is not

necessary.

10 general matter coupling and perturbative quantum

gauge invariance

in this section we adopt a new strategy [5, 9] in order to construct a gauge invariant theory

of quantum gravity coupled to matter eld. this purely quantum approach relies merely on

the inductive causal construction of tn (see sec. 1) and on the perturbative quantum gauge
invariance condition (see sec. 3).it does not appeal to any classical lagrangian and uses only

free quantum elds. in [9] this idea was implemented in pure qg: one considers the most general

coupling between three gravitons and the most general ghost coupling, then one requires that

the perturbative gauge invariance condition holds to rst order. this restricts the number

of the possible theories. the analysis of gauge invariance in second order should reduce this
number further on. the theory characterized by the t h+g
from lhe lies among them.

(x), eq. (13) and eq. (18), derived

1

10.1 massive case

we adopt the same strategy by choosing the following ansatz for the most general massive

matter coupling (disregarding non-relevant divergence couplings) between one graviton and

two matter elds:

t m
1 (x) = i



2(cid:0) + x : h,, : +y : h, : +z : h, : +w m2 : h :(cid:1) ,

(85)

where x, y, z, w  r are undetermined coecients. the quantized graviton and matter elds
satisfy the commutation rules eq. (12) and eq. (57), respectively. the condition of perturbative

gauge invariance in rst order, dqt m
the graviton vacuum polarization contribution t v p
equivalent to the slavnov-ward identity, implies w =  x
becomes

1 = div., implies y = z

in second order, for
2 = div., which is
2 so that the general matter coupling

2(cid:0) + x : h,, : +

z
2

: h, : +z : h, :

m2 : h :(cid:1) ,

(86)

with only two undetermined coecients instead of four. the analysis of perturbative gauge

invariance in second order in the tree sector gives two possible solutions:

dqt tree

2 + dqn tree

2 = div.  x = z

or x = z + 1 .

(87)

25

both of the conditions on the right side are in agreement with the natural assumption that the

rst order coupling can be written as

t m
1 (x) = i


2

: h(x)b

m (x) :

(88)

for an improved energy-momentum tensor with 
m (x), = 0. the b -tensor appears here
because we are using the expansion of the goldberg variable. thus, we have seen that if we start
1 , eq. (85), with four undetermined parameters, then perturbative
gauge invariance up to the second order is able to reduce this number to one. analysis of the

with the general ansatz for t m

third order should then x unambiguously this last parametric freedom.

10.2 massless case

as in the previous section, we investigate if the condition of perturbative quantum gauge

invariance is strong enough to select by itself, among all the possible couplings between massless

matter elds and gravitons, the right coupling, namely to select only one coupling which,

in addition, should agree with the expansion of the classical lagrangian. let us write the

most general ansatz for the massless matter coupling (disregarding unimportant divergence

couplings):

t m
1 (x) = i

= i

2(cid:0) + x : h,, : +y : h, : +z : h, :(cid:1)

: h(x)b 

m (x) : ,

(89)

where x, y, z  r are undetermined coecients and 
with 
the classical theory, we expand the non-minimally matter coupled lagrangian

m (x), = 0. to establish a connection between our undetermined coecients x, y, z and

m an improved energy-momentum tensor

lm =

g(cid:0)g;; + r2(cid:1)

(90)

in terms of the graviton eld and compare the coecients. we obtain the relations: x =
1  2, y = , z = 2. if  = 1/6 we obtain the callan-jackiw improved energy-momentum
tensor [35]. on the other side we can also consider in eq. (89) the most general conserved and

traceless energy-momentum tensor:

m =  ,, 



4

,, 


2

, ,   r ,

(91)

26

which gives the relations: x = , y = /4, z = /2. first order gauge invariance, dqt m
1 =
div. is always satised. second order gauge invariance for the graviton vacuum polarization,
2 = div., requires that y = z/2. since the particle circulating in the loop is massless, we
dqt v p
expect the vacuum polarization tensor to be traceless, too; this implies y = x/4, z = x/2.
with these relations among the parameters we can undertake the investigation of perturbative

gauge invariance in second order in the tree sector. we nd again

dqt tree

2 + dqn tree

2 = div.  x = z

or x = z + 1 .

(92)

obviously the rst relation x = z cannot be satised by our coecients in both cases, eq. (90)
and eq. (91), therefore should be rejected. the second relation x = z + 1 is satised   r
in the case of non-minimal matter coupling r2. the reason is that this term has zero gauge
variation so that its addition to the term : h,, :, which is already gauge invariant in rst
and second order, does not change the theory from the point of view of the gauge structure.

on the other side, if we examine the relation x = z + 1 in view of eq. (91), we nd that it has

only one solution, namely  = 2/3. therefore, according to our strategy, perturbative quantum

gauge invariance to rst and second order, together with some assumption on the structure of

the massless matter energy-momentum tensor eq. (91), leads to the coupling

t m
1 (x) = i

(93)

this result is equivalent to the choice of  = 1/6 in eq. (90) and, equivalently, to the use of

the callan-jackiw improved energy-momentum tensor.
