abstract

the quantum mechanical transition between a free particle la-
grangian and the klein gordon eld description of a free particle (par-
ticle wave duality) is conjectured to extend to an analogous construc-
tion of relativistically invariant wave equations associated with strings
and branes, which we propose to call brane-wave duality. electromag-
netic interactions in the two systems are discussed. it is emphasised
that all integrable free eld theories, including those of dirac-born-
infeld type, are associated with lagrangians equivalent to divergences
on the space of solutions of the equations of motion.

(for a massless eld) this may be cited as an example of particle-wave duality.
is there a similar alternative description of strings and branes? one goal
of this article is to suggest that there is a natural extension. the idea is
that corresponding to each direction in the world-volume there should be
associated a eld. for example the strings described by the nambu-goto
string lagrangian

logue of particle-wave duality we might facetiously describe as brane-wave
duality. the physical content of both theories is expected to be the same.

this lagrangian has been studied in the literature in the special case of a
4-dimensional target space by hosotani [1]. this amounts to a change of
variables in this case. his generalisation to higher dimensional target spaces
appears to be dierent [2].

the two properties found for the schild lagrangian (l3)2, namely that
l3 transforms under reparametisation of the independent variables with a
factor which is the jacobian of the transformation and that l3 vanishes or
is constant on the space of solutions of the equations of motion [3][4], have
recently been shown to persist for lagrangians of the dirac-born-infeld type
[5][6][7] ,

even in the presence of electromagnetic elds [8]. analogues of both these
properties may be deduced for the wave eld lagrangians introduced in this
paper (5). we see the rst of these as being common to all theories describing
free objects, and devote the next section to a catalogue of examples. some
supersymmetric examples are given in the following section.

we then demonstrate how the dieomorphism invariance of the brane
lagrangians translates into covariance of solutions for the wave elds with
square root lagrangians. some special cases of these are shown to be com-
pletely integrable in implicit form and nally we make some speculative re-
marks concerning the coupling of gauge theories to the wave elds.

lagrangians for free elds

in fact we may note that a generic property of free elds is that their la-
grangians vanish, or are divergences on the space of solutions of the equations
of motion which vanish, with vanishing rst derivatives on the boundary.
this is trivial for l2, the klein gordon lagrangian, which may be rewritten
after partial integration as

l2 = 

1

2 x

(8)

and the right hand side is a divergence. this principle extends to the wave
lagrangians of born-infeld type in a straightforward manner. here, under
eld redenitions   (, ),   (, ) the lagrangian l4 scales with
a conformal factor which is the jacobian of the transformation. also the
quantity





x 


l4
 
x




considered as a lagrangian, reproduces the same equation of motion as does
l4 and is zero on the space of solutions. it thus diers from l4 by a diver-
gence. in a similar fashion





x 


l4

(10)

is itself a divergence. similar remarks, mutatis mutandis, can be made about
the same constructions with   . these statements are easy to prove and
simply depend upon the determinantal nature of l4. the key result, which
obtains also in general dimension for (5) is that

the rst term on the right hand side is a divergence, the second is simply
2l4, as a consequence of the determinantal properties of l4. thus the
left hand side of (12) serves as an equivalent lagrangian, giving the same
equations of motion as the original one. in the case of (10) the corresponding
term left over after extracting the divergence is zero, again as a consequence
of determinantal properties. obviously this argument extends to dual brane

lagrangians of any dimension. this property suggests that these lagrangians
have a pseudo-topological aspect.
if they were equivalent to divergences
without any further constraint, they would be fully topological; but here the
equivalence works only for solutions of the equations of motion.

3 supersymmetric lagrangians

in this section the previous results for free elds are extended to supersym-
metric lagrangians. the lagrangians for a free chiral supereld and a free
vector supereld are both total derivatives when the equations of motion are
satised. this is true for both the massive and massless cases.

3.1 chiral superelds
a general chiral supereld in superspace (x, , ) has the form

 = a(x)+im ma(x)+

1
4

  a(x)+2(x)im(x)m +f (x).

(13)

consider the lagrangian involving only chiral superelds as below.

l = 

i i|   +

1
2

mij(ij| + 

i 

j|  )

(14)

where mij is symmetric with respect to indices i and j. the equations of
motion for this lagrangian are as follows:

f 
fi + mija

i + mijaj = 0,
j = 0,

a
ai + mijf 

i + mijfj = 0,
j = 0,

im im  mijj = 0
immi + mij j = 0.

(15)

it is possible to write the lagrangian in terms of these equations of motion
plus total derivatives. the lagrangian is therefore a total derivative when
the equations of motion are satised.

l =

1
i(m im  mijj)i

i (ai + mijf 

a

+

1
2

i(immi + mij j)

j ) +

ai(a

1
i + mijfj)
2
+ total derivatives

(16)

5

a more general supersymmetric lagrangian for chiral elds would in-
volve the addition of the terms 1
3 gijkijk and ii and their hermitian
conjugates but if these are added then the lagrangian is no longer a total
derivative when the equations of motion are satised.

3.2 vector superelds

a general vector supereld takes the form

v = c(x) + i(x)  i (x) +

i
2

[m(x) + in(x)]

 [m(x)  in(x)] + i [(x) +

i
2

(17)

i
2


 i [(x) +

i
2

mm (x)] +

1
2

  [d(x) +

1
2

c(x)].

for a free vector eld the lagrangian can be written as

1
4

l =

(w w| + w  w |  ) + m2v 2

where

w = 

1
4

d ddv,

w  = 

1
4

dd d v.

(18)

(19)

for the massless case we can use the wess-zumino gauge in which the com-
ponent elds c, , m and n are all zero. the lagrangian is then just

where

l =

1
2

d2 

1
4

vmnvmn  imm

vmn = mvn  nvm

(20)

(21)

and in this case it is easy to show that the lagrangian is a total derivative
when the equations of motion are satised. for the massive case we cannot
use the wess-zumino gauge. however the action can be rewritten as [9]

s[v ] =

1

8 z d4xd4 v d d2dv + m2z d4xd4 v 2

(22)

6

and the equations of motion are

d d2dv + m2v = 0

1
8

(23)

so from this it can be see that the lagrangian is a total derivative when the
equations of motion are satised. this does not work for other lagrangians
which involve interaction terms.

4 covariance

this chapter deals with special properties of lagrangian densities of the
previous form, but where the square root has been taken, as in the stan-
dard born-infeld. here the feature of general covariance plays an important
role. this works for arbitrary dimension; under the transformation of the

lagrangian l under the eld redenition

i  i(1, 2, . . . , n),

(24)

l acquires a factor which is the jacobian of the transformation and the

equations of motion are unaected on account of (11) since they are given
by

(25)

as the rst two terms cancel on account of (11). thus the square root of the
determinantal form is a generally covariant lagrangian, which means that
any function of a solution remains a solution of the equations of motion.
in fact the equations of motion arising from these lagrangians, in the case
where the number of co-ordinates x exceeds that of the number n of wave

elds by one are a generalisation of the bateman equation1 and are expected
to be completely integrable, since this is the case for n = 1 and n = 2, as we
shall demonstrate in the next section.

4.1

integrability in special cases

consider the lagrangian

ltwo = vuutx  
x!2

(26)

in the case of 2 dimensions ( = 1, 2). this action is fully integrable as the
equation of motion is just the well known bateman equation [10]

this equation has the general solution;

f ()x1 + g()x2 = c = constant

(28)

where f, g are two arbitrary functions.
it is clearly covariant; if  is a
solution so is any function of . it is equivalent to a monge nonlinear wave

this equation is equivalent to (29). the remarkable feature of this la-
grangian is that any dierentiable function f (u) instead of 1 + u2 will give
the same equations of motion [10]! this generalises; in the second case

lthree = (x2x3  x3x2)q(1 + u2 + v2)

and the two independent equations of motion are

q(1 + u2 + v2) may be replaced by any arbitrary dierentiable function of

these equations admit an implicit solution for (u, v) given by solving the
equations

u = f (x3 + ux1, x2 + vx1),

v = g(x3 + ux1, x2 + vx1)

(38)

where f, g are two arbitrary functions of two variables. the general so-
lution to the equations of motion is given by setting u = u(, ) and
v = v (, ) where u, v are two further arbitrary functions, and solving
(37) for , . this demonstrates the integrability of the equations of motion.
the generalisation to n elds in n + 1 dimensions will be straightforward.
it is anticipated that there will be an integrable generalisation to n elds
in d dimensions along the lines of the universal field equation [10][11], but
that would take us too far aeld and away from the spirit of the present
investigation.

5 electromagnetic interactions

the subject of electromagnetic interactions in the study of these new la-
grangians is at this stage somewhat speculative. in the original theory, elec-
tromagnetic interactions are implemented by the rather ad-hoc procedure of
adding an antisymmetric piece to the induced metric; gij  gij + fij this
is consistent with the picture of having gauge elds living on the brane, and
presumably conned to it by some meissner type eect. however the natural
way to couple electromagnetic elds to the dual theory is through a coupling
to the conserved currents in the theory. this will ensure gauge invariance.
it is easy to construct such conserved quantities, eg

j ij
 =

l
 i
x

j,

i 6= j

(39)

and in the case i = j, the currents j ii  j jj are also conserved. there is
however an embarasse de richesse here as these currents carry two indices.
thus the natural coupling is to a two index gauge eld aij
 transforming
under so(n), i.e. the contribution

aij

 j ij



lcurrent = xi,j

10

(40)

represents the part of the lagrangian coupling a non abelian gauge eld to
the elds i. this suggestion, though appealing, is rather unorthodox. it is
however gauge invariant up to a divergence, as in the gauge transformation

aij
  oikakl

 olj + oik 
x

okj

(41)

the rotation matrices may be removed by a linear transformation of the elds
i and the inhomogeneous term converted to an innoccuous divergence. if
one wants instead to mimic the dirac-born-infeld incorporation of electro-
magnetism, the simplest assumption would be to suppose that a depends
upon the co-ordinates x only through their dependence upon j with direc-
tion in a linear combination of the gradients of j. then we may set

a = xj

j
xaj(i).

(42)

then a new lagrangian which adds a term to the matrix components anti-
symmetric in (i, j), the antisymmetry being related to that of f takes the
form with lij = i
x

l = det(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

.

this manifestly gauge invariant suggestion is in the same spirit as the original
born-infeld lagrangian especially if the square root form is taken.

an alternative suggestion to compare the kalb-ramond string interaction

seems less satisfactory, because on the dual brane side this would give

and this interaction, though gauge invariant is more like a pauli term than
one coming from minimal coupling.

6 conclusion

while our answer might require some modication, we believe that we have
posed an interesting and important question; to nd lagrangians for elds
which bear a similar relation to string and brane lagrangians as does the
klein gordon to that of the classical point particle. a common characteristic
of these lagrangians, as indeed of all free theories, is that they are pseudo-
topological, i.e. the lagrangian is equivalent to a divergence on the space
of solutions of the equations of motion.
if the square root form is taken
then the new lagrangians are covariant, and the equations of motion are
integrable and coincide in the case that the dimensions of space-time exceeds
the that of the elds by one, with the universal field equations proposed
earlier [10][11]. some ideas for the introduction of gauge elds have been
discussed.
