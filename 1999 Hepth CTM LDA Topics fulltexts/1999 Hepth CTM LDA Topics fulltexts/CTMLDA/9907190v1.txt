we study the divergence of large-order perturbation theory in the worldline expression
for the two-loop euler-heisenberg qed eective lagrangian in a constant magnetic eld.
the leading rate of divergence is identical, up to an overall factor, to that of the one-loop
case. from this we deduce, using borel summation techniques, that the leading behaviour
of the imaginary part of the two-loop eective lagrangian for a constant e eld, giving the
pair-production rate, is proportional to the one-loop result. this also serves as a test of the
mass renormalization, and conrms the earlier analysis by ritus.

i. introduction

euler and heisenberg [1], and many others since [2,3,4,5,6], computed the exact renormalized one-loop
qed eective action for electrons in a uniform electromagnetic eld background. when the background is
purely that of a static magnetic eld, the eective action is minus the eective energy of the electrons in
that background. when the background is purely that of a uniform electric eld, the eective action has an
imaginary part which determines the pair-production rate of electron-positron pairs from vacuum [1,2,3,4,5,6].
in this paper we consider the two-loop euler-heisenberg eective action, and we show how the divergence
of the perturbative expression for the eective action with a uniform magnetic background is related to the
non-perturbative imaginary part of the eective action with a uniform electric background. the two-loop
euler-heisenberg eective lagrangian, describing the eect of a single photon exchange in the electron loop,
was rst calculated by ritus [7], and later recalculated by dittrich and reuter [8] for the magnetic eld
case. in both cases the proper-time method and the exact dirac propagator in the uniform eld were used.
more recently the magnetic eld computation was repeated in [9] using the more convenient worldline
formalism [10,11]. this calculation revealed that the previous results by ritus and dittrich/reuter were
actually incompatible, and diered precisely by a nite electron mass renormalization. this prompted yet
another recalculation of this quantity in the worldline formalism [12], now using dimensional regularisation
instead of a proper-time cuto as had been used in the previous calculations. that calculation conrmed
the correctness of rituss result, and conversely showed that the nal result given by [8] was not expressed
in terms of the physical electron mass. as part of our analysis here, we show how this nite dierence in
the mass renormalization aects the large-order behaviour of perturbation theory, and how this aects the
leading contribution to the imaginary part of the eective action in the electric eld case.

for a uniform magnetic background, of strength b, the one-loop eective lagrangian has a simple proper-

time integral representation [1,2,3,4,5,6]:

s term is a subtraction of the zero eld (b = 0) eective action, while the s

the 1
3 subtraction corresponds to
a logarithmically divergent charge renormalization. for a given strength b, this integral can be evaluated
numerically [8]. alternatively, we can make contact with a perturbative evaluation of the one-loop eective
action by making an asymptotic expansion of the integral in the weak eld limit  i.e., for small values of
the dimensionless parameter eb

here the b2n are bernoulli numbers [13]. each term in this expansion of l(1) is associated with a one-fermion-
loop feynman diagram. note that only even powers of eb appear, as expected due to charge conjugation
invariance (furrys theorem). the divergent o(e2) self-energy term is not included as it contributes to the
bare lagrangian by charge renormalization.

the expansion (2) is the prototypical eective eld theory eective lagrangian [14], where the low

energy eective lagrangian, for energies well below the fermion mass scale m, is expanded as

l = m4 xn

an

o(n)
mn

(3)

with o(n) being an operator of dimension n. for qed in a uniform background, the higher dimensional
operators o(n) are formed from powers of lorentz invariant combinations of the uniform eld strength f .
for a uniform magnetic background this simply means even powers of b, as in (2). note that the low
energy condition here means that the cyclotron energy eb
m is well below the fermion mass scale m; in other
words, eb

the euler-heisenberg lagrangian encodes the information on the low-energy limit of the one-loop n -
photon amplitudes in a way which is highly convenient for the derivation of various nonlinear qed eects
such as vacuum birefringence (see, e. g., [15] and refs. therein) or photon splitting [16,17]. the experimental
observation of vacuum birefringence is presently attempted by laser experiments [18,19]. there is also recent
experimental evidence for vacuum eects in pair production with strong laser electric elds [20].

the one-loop euler-heisenberg perturbative eective action (2) is not a convergent series. the one-loop
expansion coecients in (2) alternate in sign [since sign(b2n) = (1)n+1], but grow factorially in magnitude
(see also table 1):

so the perturbative expansion (2) is a divergent series. this divergent behaviour is not a bad thing; it is
completely analogous to generic behaviour that is well known in perturbation theory in both quantum eld
theory and quantum mechanics [21]. for example, dyson [22] argued physically that qed perturbation
theory is non-analytic, and therefore presumably divergent, as an expansion in the ne structure constant
, because the theory is unstable when  is negative. as is well known, the divergence of high orders of
perturbation theory can be used to extract information about non-perturbative decay and tunneling rates,
thereby providing a bridge between perturbative and non-perturbative physics [21]. it has been argued [23],
based on the behaviour of the one-loop euler-heisenberg eective lagrangian (2), that the eective eld
theory expansion (3) is generically divergent. here we consider this question at the two-loop level.

we stress that for energies well below the scale set by the fermion mass m, the divergent nature of the
eective lagrangian is not important, as the rst few terms in the series (2) provide an accurate approxima-
tion. however, the divergence properties do become important when the external energy scale approaches
the fermion mass scale m. the divergence is also the key to understanding how non-perturbative imaginary
contributions to the eective action arise from real perturbation theory.

ii. borel analysis of the one-loop euler-heisenberg effective lagrangian

to begin, we review very briey some basics of borel summation [24,25,26,27]. consider an asymptotic

series expansion of some function f (g)

2

f (g) 

an gn



xn=0

(5)

where g  0+ is a small dimensionless perturbation expansion parameter. in an extremely broad range of
physics applications [21] one nds that perturbation theory leads not to a convergent series but to a divergent
series in which the expansion coecients an have leading large-order behaviour

an  (1)nn( n + )

(n  )

(6)

for some real constants ,  > 0, and . when  > 0, the perturbative expansion coecients an alternate
in sign and their magnitude grows factorially, just as in the euler-heisenberg case (4). borel summation is
a useful approach to this case of a divergent, but alternating series. non-alternating series must be treated
somewhat dierently.

to motivate the borel approach, consider the classic example : an = (1)nnn!, and  > 0. the series

(5) is clearly divergent for any value of the expansion parameter g. write



f (g) 



ds sn es

(1)n(g)n z 
xn=0
g z 
ds (cid:18) 1

1

0

0

1 + s(cid:19) exp(cid:20)

s

g(cid:21)

(7)

where we have formally interchanged the order of summation and integration. the nal integral, which is
convergent for all g > 0, is dened to be the sum of the divergent series. to be more precise [24,25], the formula
(7) should be read backwards: for g  0+, we can use laplaces method to make an asymptotic expansion
of the integral, and we obtain the asymptotic series in (5) with expansion coecients an = (1)nnn!.
for a non-alternating series, such as an = nn!, we need f (g). the borel integral (7) is [24,25] an
analytic function of g in the cut g plane:
|arg(g)| < . so a dispersion relation (using the discontinuity
across the cut along the negative g axis) can be used to dene the imaginary part of f (g) for negative values
of the expansion parameter:

imf (g) 


g

exp[

1
g

]

(8)

the imaginary contribution (8) is non-perturbative (it clearly does not have an expansion in positive powers
of g) and has important physical consequences. note that (8) is consistent with a principal parts prescription
for the pole that appears on the s > 0 axis if we make the formal manipulations as in (7):



xn=0

nn! gn 

1

g z 

0

ds (cid:18) 1

1  s(cid:19) exp(cid:20)

s

g(cid:21)

(9)

similar formal arguments can be applied to the case when the expansion coecients have leading behaviour

(6). then the leading borel approximation is

f (g)

0

ds

s (cid:18) 1

1 + s(cid:19)(cid:18) s

g(cid:19)/

exp"(cid:18) s

g(cid:19)1/#

for the corresponding non-alternating case, when g is negative, the leading imaginary contribution is

imf (g) 



(cid:18) 1

g(cid:19)/

exp"(cid:18) 1

g(cid:19)1/#

(10)

(11)

note the separate meanings of the parameters ,  and  that appear in the formula (6) for the leading large-
order growth of the expansion coecients. the constant  clearly combines with g as an eective expansion

3

parameter. the power of the exponent in (11) is determined by , while the power of the prefactor in (11)
is determined by the ratio 
 .

it must be stressed that these formulas (10) and (11) are formal, being based on assumed analyticity
properties of the function f (g). the borel dispersion relations could be complicated by the appearance of
additional poles and/or cuts in the complex g plane, signalling new physics [27]. in certain special cases these
analyticity assumptions can be tested rigorously, but we have in mind the situation in which one is confronted
with the expansion coecients an of a perturbative expansion, without corresponding information about the
function that this series is supposed to represent. this is a common circumstance in physical applications of
perturbation theory. for example, borel techniques have recently been used to study the divergence of the
derivative expansion for qed eective actions in inhomogeneous backgrounds [28].

n have leading large-order behaviour of the form (6), with  = 1

returning to the euler-heisenberg eective lagrangian, the question of whether the perturbative expan-
sion is alternating or non-alternating is directly relevant. for a uniform magnetic background, the one-loop
euler-heisenberg series (2) is precisely of the form (5) with g = ( eb
m2 )2. moreover, from (4) the expansion
coecients a(1)
2 , and  =  = 2. in fact,
taking into account the sub-leading corrections indicated in (4), the proper-time integral representation (1)
is precisely the borel sum, using (10), of the divergent series (2) [28]. for a uniform electric background, the
only dierence perturbatively is that b2 is replaced by e2; that is, g = ( eb
m2 )2.
so the perturbative one-loop euler-heisenberg series (2) becomes non-alternating. then from (11), with
 = 1
2 and  =  = 2, we immediately deduce the leading behaviour of the imaginary part of the one-loop
euler-heisenberg eective lagrangian:

m2 )2 is replaced by g = ( ee

iml(1) 

m4

m2(cid:19)2
83 (cid:18) ee

exp(cid:20)

m2

ee (cid:21)

(12)

this imaginary part has direct physical signicance - it gives half the electron-positron pair production rate
in the uniform electric eld e [3,4,6]. actually, since we also know the sub-leading corrections (4) to the
leading large-order behaviour of the expansion coecients a(1)
n , we can apply (11) successively to go beyond
the leading behaviour in (12):

iml(1)

83 (cid:18) ee

m2(cid:19)2 
xk=1

k2 exp(cid:20)

m2k

ee (cid:21)

(13)

this is schwingers classic result [3] for the imaginary part of the one-loop eective lagrangian in a uniform
electric eld e. to elucidate the physical meaning of the individual terms of this series it is useful to employ
the following alternative representation due to nikishov [4],

2
h

iml(1)v t = xr z d3pv

(2h)3 ln(1  np),
m2 + p2
ee (cid:17)



np = exp(cid:16)

(14)

here np is the mean number of pairs produced by the eld in the state with given momentum p and spin
projection r. an expansion of the logarithm in np and term-by-term integration leads back to schwingers
formula (13). thus the leading term in this formula can be interpreted as the mean number np of pairs in
the unit 4-volume v t , while the higher (k  2) terms describe the coherent creation of k pairs.
pair creation can occur for any value of the electric eld strength, though due to the exponential suppression
factors one is presently still far away from being able to observe spontaneous pair creation by macroscopic
elds in the laboratory. however, it can be arranged for electrons traversing the focus of a terawatt laser
to see a critical eld in their rest frame. this has recently led to the rst observation of pair creation in a
process involving only real photons [20].

for the one-loop euler-heisenberg qed eective lagrangian, this large-order perturbation theory analysis
n . this

is greatly simplied by the fact that we know the exact formula (4) for the expansion coecients a(1)

4

will not be the case below, when we discuss the two-loop euler-heisenberg eective lagrangian. so, for the
sake of numerical comparison, we compare the exact one-loop coecients a(1)
n with their leading large-order
behaviour. the coecients are listed in table 1 up to n = 15. since the growth is fast, it is convenient to
compare the logarithms, as is done in figure 1. with 16 terms it is straightforward to t the the values

of ,  and  appearing in (6); moreover, there is sucient accuracy to t the overall coecient
figure 1 we plot a(1)
n = log[(2n + 2)/(82n+4)]. the agreement is spectacular, already
for n = 0. indeed, on this scale the two plots are indistinguishable. to go beyond the leading large-order
behaviour, we plot the dierence a(1)
22n+4 ,
with remarkable accuracy for n  2, as illustrated in figure 2.

iii. the two-loop euler-heisenberg effective lagrangian

we now turn to the two-loop euler-heisenberg eective lagrangian, describing the eect of a single
photon exchange in the electron loop. this quantity was rst studied by ritus [7]. using the exact electron
propagator in a constant eld found by fock [29] and schwinger [3], and a proper-time cuto as the uv
regulator, he obtained the on-shell renormalized l(2) in terms of a certain two-parameter integral. from this
integral the imaginary part of the lagrangian was then extracted by a painstaking analysis of its analyticity
properties, yielding a representation analogous to schwingers one-loop formula (13) [30]. adding up the
one-loop and the two-loop contributions to the imaginary part the result reads

iml(1) + iml(2)

(16)

according to [7] the physical interpretation of the individual terms in the series in terms of coherent multipair
creation can be carried over to the two-loop level. this requires one to absorb the term linear in  into the
exponential factor, rewriting

h 1
k2 + kk(cid:0)

m2(cid:1)i exp(cid:20)

ee (cid:21)

ee (cid:21)

(17)

the individual terms in the expansion (15) of kk() are then to be absorbed into the mass shift m  m.
for the lowest order terms in this expansion, those given in (15), the physical meaning of the corresponding
mass shifts in terms of the coherent pair production picture is discussed in [7]. for example, the leading
1 in the expansion of k1() after exponentiation yields a mass shift that can be identied as the classical
change in mass caused for one particle in a created pair by the acceleration due to its partner.

assuming this exponentiation to work one can, of course, obtain some partial information on the higher-
loop corrections to the imaginary part. more remarkably, since the above physical interpretation requires the
mass appearing in the exponent to be the physical one, it allows one to determine the physical renormalized
mass from an inspection of the renormalized lagrange function alone, rather than by a calculation of the
(lower order) electron self energy.

following the pioneering work by ritus and his collaborators, a rst recalculation of the euler-heisenberg
lagrangian was done by dittrich and reuter [8] for the magnetic eld case. the more recent recalculation
in [9] showed that the two previous results were actually incompatible, and diered precisely by a nite
electron mass renormalisation. all three calculations had been done using a proper-time cuto rather than
dimensional regularisation. this cuto leads to relatively simple integrals, but due to its non-universality
makes it, at the two-loop level, already non-trivial to determine the physical renormalized electron mass. a
fourth calculation of this quantity [12], now using dimensional regularisation, yielded complete agreement
with rituss result after a perturbative expansion of both results in powers of the b eld had been performed.
in the following we will push the same calculation to o(b34), and analyze the rate of growth of the expansion
coecients.

iv. borel analysis of the two-loop euler-heisenberg effective

the second term in the two-loop expression (18) is generated by the one-loop electron mass renormalisation,
which at the two-loop level becomes necessary in addition to the photon wave function renormalisation. for
this mass renormalization term we have found the following exact expansion:

(20)

here b2n are the bernoulli numbers, and (x) = (x)

(x) is the digamma function [13]. we have not succeeded
in nding a closed-form expression for the expansion coecients arising from the expansion of the double
integral in (18), although we suspect that one may exist. instead, we have made an algebraic expansion of
this integral, using mathematica and maple. when combined with the exact expansion (20) of the
mass renormalization term we obtain an expansion of the form:

l(2) = 

m4

(4)3 (cid:18) eb

m2(cid:19)4 
xn=0

a(2)

n (cid:18) eb

m2(cid:19)2n

(21)

the expansion coecients a(2)
are listed in table 1, up to n = 15. note that those coecients are in
n
some sense less universal than their one-loop counterparts, since they depend on the one-loop normalization
condition imposed on the renormalized electron mass.

several comments are in order. first, the two-loop expansion coecients a(2)
in the one-loop magnetic background case (4). second, the magnitude |a(2)

n alternate in sign, just as
n | is clearly growing factorially
fast with n. thus, the two-loop euler-heisenberg series (21) is a divergent series, as is the one-loop euler-
heisenberg series (2). note also that for each series the smallest magnitude coecient is reached already for
n = 1, after which the coecients begin to increase rapidly in magnitude.

to extract the leading large-n growth of |a(2)
n to the form in (6). once again, it is convenient
to work with the logarithm dn = log(|an|) since the growth is so rapid. it is relatively straightforward to
nd that  =  = 2 and  = 1
2 . it is more dicult to t the overall coecient, but if we assume this is a
simple power of  then our best t for the leading large-order growth of the two-loop expansion coecients
in (21) is:

n | we t a(2)

(2n + 2)

(22)

this leading t is displayed in figure 3, in terms of a(2)
t shown in figure 1, but it is still very good.

note the remarkable similarity of the leading large-order growth (22) of the two-loop expansion coecients
to the leading large-order growth of the one-loop expansion coecients in (4). the only dierence is the
overall coecient. the parameters ,  and  in the general form (6) are identical. using the borel technique
to relate this leading growth rate to the leading non-perturbative imaginary part of the eective lagrangian
in a uniform electric eld e, we deduce that the two-loop leading imaginary part is proportional to the
one-loop leading imaginary part (12). in fact, from (11) and (22), we nd the leading contribution

this has exactly the same dependence on the electric eld e as the one-loop case. so to two-loop order

the leading non-perturbative behaviour of the imaginary part of the eective lagrangian is:

n = log[16(2n + 2)/2n+2], up to n = 15. the dashed line represents the t in (25).

to go beyond this leading term we need to look at corrections to the leading behaviour in (23). in figure
4 we plot the dierence of the logarithms, and we see that the n dependence is much more gentle than the
rapid fall-o found in the one-loop case, which was plotted in figure 2. in fact, from the terms up to n = 15,
we obtain the t

this is a considerably weaker n dependence than is found for the rst correction in the one-loop case (4).
this means that in the two-loop case the dominant corrections are to the prefactor in the leading behaviour
(23). this is in contrast to the one-loop case (13) where the rst correction to the leading behaviour is
exponentially suppressed. indeed, applying the borel relations, the correction term (25) leads to

we emphasize that the t in (25) is based on a simple t to the rst 16 two-loop coecients. nevertheless,
the structure of (26) conforms already to the form of rituss expansion in eq.(15). it would be interesting
to probe this correction term in more detail by a further study of the analyticity properties of the integral
representations [7,9,12] of the two-loop euler-heisenberg eective lagrangian, or by looking at still higher
orders in perturbation theory.

v. concluding remarks

our analysis also permits us to study the dependence of (23), the leading non-perturbative imaginary
contribution to the eective lagrangian, on the electron mass renormalisation. in the world-line expression
(18) for the two-loop euler-heisenberg eective lagrangian, a nite change of the renormalised electron mass
would amount to an arbitrary change of the constant 3
2   appearing in the second bracket of the second
term. for example, in [9] it had been shown that the renormalised lagrangian obtained by [8] diers from
(18) precisely by a replacement of 3
6 . a separate study of the contributions of the rst and second
term in (18) shows that, due to cancellations between both terms, the leading large-n growth of their sum
is smaller than for each term separately. however this property holds true only if the renormalised electron
mass is the physical one.

n = log[16(2n + 2)/2n+2], of the logarithm of

n extracted from the result of [8]. one can clearly see the divergence between these two

for deniteness, in figure 5 we compare the correct leading growth (22) of the two-loop coecients with
the coecients obtained by expanding out the two-loop result of [8]. the dierence in the leading large-n
growths is obvious. thus, in agreement with the analysis of [7], we nd that if and only if expressed in terms
of the true electron mass will the imaginary part of the renormalised two-loop lagrangian show the same
exponential suppression factor exp[m2/(ee)] as for the one-loop lagrangian.
to summarize, we have constructed the imaginary part of the two-loop qed euler-heisenberg lagrangian
in a constant electric eld by a computer based calculation of its weak eld expansion together with borel
summation techniques. the knowledge of the rst 16 coecients has turned out to be sucient to verify
the structure of the leading (k = 1) term in rituss eq.(15), and to obtain a numerical value for the rst

o(pee/m2) correction contained in that formula. the method used here is signicantly simpler than the

one in [7,30], where the imaginary part was obtained by an analysis of the analyticity properties of the
two-loop parameter integrals.

in particular, we have seen that the large order behaviour of the two-loop coecients is the same (up to an
overall constant factor) as the one-loop case. this means that the leading contribution to the imaginary part
of the two-loop eective lagrangian has the same form as in the one-loop case. this gives a new perspective
to rituss arguments [7] that the true renormalized electron mass m is such that the leading exponential
factor in the pair production rate is exp[m2/(ee)]. since those arguments pertain to arbitrary loop orders,

10

and the leading exponential factor is directly related to the leading growth rate in the weak eld expansion,
they also lead one to expect that the euler-heisenberg lagrangian may be amenable to this type of borel
analysis at any xed loop order in perturbation theory.
