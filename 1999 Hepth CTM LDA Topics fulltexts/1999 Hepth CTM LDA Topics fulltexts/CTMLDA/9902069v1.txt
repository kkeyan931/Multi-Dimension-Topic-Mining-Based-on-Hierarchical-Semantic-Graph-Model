abstract

we propose a mechanism to break the translational invariance of compactied space
spontaneously. as a simple model, we study a real 4 model compactied on m d1  s1
in detail, where we impose a nontrivial boundary condition on  for the s1-direction. it
is shown that the translational invariance for the s1-direction is spontaneously broken
when the radius r of s1 becomes larger than a critical radius r and also that the model
behaves like a 4 model on a single kink background for r  . it is pointed out that
spontaneous breakdown of translational invariance is accompanied by that of some global
symmetries, in general, in our mechanism.

spacetime translational invariance can be broken spontaneously if any local opera-

tors acquire spacetime-dependent vacuum expectation values. this situation, however,

seems implausible because a conguration which minimizes a potential is, in general, in-

dependent of spacetime coordinates and further because the spacetime-dependent vacuum

conguration would produce nonzero kinetic energy, so that energetically such the con-

guration would be unfavorable. one might expect that even if some of space dimensions

are compactied, the translational invariance of the compactied space (if exists) could

not be broken spontaneously.

the purpose of this paper is to propose a mechanism to break the translational invari-

ance of compactied spaces spontaneously. to illustrate our mechanism, let us consider
a real 4 model in d dimensions

s = z ddx(cid:26)

1
2

m m   v ()(cid:27) ,

where the index m runs from 0 to d  1 and

v () =



8  2  2

2

 !2

.

we should note that the action has a z2 symmetry

  .

(1)

(2)

(3)

it turns out that the existence of global symmetries is crucial to our mechanism and that

the above z2 symmetry plays an important role in this model. one may conclude that
, at which the scalar potential v () takes
the minimum value and the z2 symmetry is broken. this is, however, a hasty conclusion,

the ground state would be given by  = q 2

as we will see below.

let us suppose that one of the space coordinates, say, y  xd1 is compactied on
a circle s1 whose radius is r. since s1 is multiply-connected and the action has the z2

symmetry, we can impose the following nontrivial boundary condition associated with the

z2 symmetry for the eld :

(x, y + 2r) = (x, y),

(4)

where x denote the coordinates of the uncompactied spacetime. thanks to the z2

symmetry, the action (1) is still single-valued even with the boundary condition (4). an

1

important consequence of the nontrivial boundary condition (4) is that any vacuum ex-
pectation value of (x, y) cannot be a (y-independent) nonzero constant, which is incon-

sistent with the boundary condition (4). in other words, any nonzero vacuum expectation
value of (x, y) should have the y dependence in order to satisfy the boundary condition

(4), i.e.

h(x, y)i 6= 0 


yh(x, y)i 6= 0.

(5)

it immediately follows that if the vacuum is translationally invariant the vacuum expec-
tation value of (x, y) has to vanish, or conversely that if (x, y) acquires a nonzero
vacuum expectation value, which implies the y dependence of h(x, y)i, then the trans-
lational invariance for the s1-direction is spontaneously broken.

in order to nd a vacuum conguration, one might try to minimize the potential v ().

this is, however, wrong in the present model. to nd a vacuum conguration, we should

take account of kinetic terms in addition to potential terms since the translational invari-

ance could be broken and then the vacuum conguration might be coordinate-dependent.
since the translational invariance of the (uncompactied) (d 1)-dimensional minkowski
spacetime is expected to be unbroken, nding a vacuum conguration of the model may
be equivalent to solving a minimization problem of the following functional :

e[, r]  z 2r

0

dy(cid:26)1

2

(y)2 + v ()(cid:27) .

(6)

in this paper, our analysis will be restricted to the tree level.

in the following, we shall ignore the x dependence in  since we are interested in a
vacuum conguration, for which the translational invariance of the (d  1)-dimensional
it should be emphasized that (y)
minkowski spacetime is assumed to be unbroken.

cannot be an arbitrary function but has to obey the (antiperiodic) boundary condition

(y + 2r) = (y).

(7)

if the translational invariance for the s1-direction is unbroken, the vacuum expectation
value of  has to vanish and then the functional e[, r] becomes

e[ = 0, r] =

r4



.

(8)

the e[] may be regarded as a potential from a viewpoint of the (d  1)-dimensional minkowski

spacetime.

2

if there exists any conguration of (y) such that

e[, r] < e[ = 0, r] =

r4



,

(9)

then the conguration  = 0 is no longer a vacuum conguration and hence the trans-
lational invariance for the s1-direction has to be broken, as discussed previously. before
minimizing the functional e[, r], we would like to make a comment about solutions to
the eld equation for (y)

0 =

e[, r]
(y)
d2(y)
dy2 +

= 


2

(y) ((y))2  2

2

 ! .

(10)

we rst note that  = 0 is a trivial solution to eq.(10), while another trivial (would-be)

solutions  = q 2

above eld equation to eliminate the term 1

 have to be excluded due to the boundary condition (7). using the

r4

2(y(y))2 in eq.(6), we nd
 z 2r
 e[ = 0, r].

((y))4

=

dy

0

e[, r](cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) e

 =0

(11)

since the equality on the last line holds only when  = 0, we have thus arrived at an

important conclusion that if there appear nontrivial solutions  to the eld equation (10),
then e[, r] is lower than e[0, r] so that the translational invariance for the s1-direction
is broken spontaneously with the z2 symmetry breaking.

let us now proceed to nd a vacuum conguration, which minimizes the functional
e[, r]. to this end, we shall rst construct whole solutions to the eld equation (10)
with the boundary condition (7), which are candidates of a vacuum conguration. we
shall then determine which conguration gives the lowest value of e[, r] (if there exist
several solutions). the eld equation (10) has been studied before in a quite dierent

context [1, 2], though the boundary condition has been imposed to be periodic but not

antiperiodic. it turns out that most of the results given in ref.[1, 2] are useful for our

purposes and that the nontrivial solutions to our problem will be given by

where

(y) =

2k


sn((y  y0), k),

 



1 + k2

.

3

(12)

(13)

here, sn(u, k) is the jacobi elliptic function whose period is 4k(k), where k(k) denotes

the complete elliptic function of the rst kind. since the integration constant y0 in eq.(12),

which in fact reects the translational invariance of the equation of motion, is irrelevant,

we shall set y0 to be equal to zero in the following analysis. the antiperiodic boundary
condition (7) requires that the parameter k (0  k < 1) and the radius r should be
related mutually through

r = (2n  1)

k(k)


(14)

for some positive integer n. (for the periodic boundary condition, 2n1 in eq.(14) should
be replaced by 2n [1, 2].) we may denote a solution specied by eq.(14) with an integer n

by n(y). we note that as k runs from zero to one the right hand side of eq.(14) increases
monotonically from rn  (n  1
2 )/ to innity. thus, n(y) is a solution only when
r  rn.

for 0 < r  r1, there exists only one solution to the eld equation (10), i.e. the
trivial solution  = 0. thus, the vacuum conguration is given by the trivial solution,
and hence the translational invariance is unbroken for 0 < r  r1. for r1 < r 
r2, there exist two solutions to eq.(10), i.e. the trivial one and 1(y). it follows from
eq.(11) that the trivial solution  = 0 is no longer the vacuum conguration. since 1(y)
depends on y, the translational invariance for the s1-direction is spontaneously broken.
for rn < r  rn+1, there exist n + 1 solutions to eq.(10), i.e. the trivial one and m(y)
for m = 1, 2,   , n. since e[m, r] < e[0, r] for every m, the trivial solution is no longer
the vacuum conguration, and hence the translational invariance for the s1-direction is
spontaneously broken for rn < r  rn+1. therefore, we have found that for 0 < r  r1
the translational invariance for the s1-direction is unbroken, while for r > r1 it is broken
spontaneously with the z2 symmetry breaking.

let us next discuss a problem which solution n(y) is the true vacuum conguration,
i.e. which solution minimizes the functional e[, r]. for r > rn, n(y) becomes a
solution for which we obtain a rather complicated expression

e[n, r] =

(2n  1)3
3(1 + k2)3/2 n(1  k2)(5 + 3k2)k(k) + 8(1 + k2)e(k)o ,

(15)

where e(k) is the complete elliptic function of the second kind. although we could
directly compare e[n, r] for n = 1, 2, 3,   , we shall here take another approach to solve

4

the problem. it is not dicult to show

de[n, r]

dr

=

4

1 + k2!2
   1  k2

 0,

(16)

which implies that e[n, r] is a monotonically increasing function of r. at r = rn
(k = 0) and  (k = 1), e[n, r] takes the values

e[n, rn] = (2n  1)
e[n,] = (2n  1)
respectively. it follows from eqs.(16) and (17) that

(2n  1)

2  e[n, r] < (2n  1)

and especially

e[1, r] <

.

the above observations will be enough to show that for r  rn (n  2)

e[1, r] < e[n, r] < e[0, r].

therefore, we have found the vacuum expectation value of  to be

h(x, y)i = ( 0

1(y)

for r  r1
for r > r1.

(17)

(18)

(19)

(20)

(21)

it may be instructive to reanalyze the model from a viewpoint of the fourier expansion.

it follows from the boundary condition (7) that (y) may be expanded in the fourier-series
for the s1-direction as

(y) =

1
r



xl=1(cid:26)a(2l1) cos(cid:18)(2l  1)

y

2r(cid:19) + b(2l1) sin(cid:18)(2l  1)

y

2r(cid:19)(cid:27) ,

or equivalently,

(y) =

1

2r xlz

(2l1)ei(2l1) y

2r

(22)

with (2l1) = 12(a(2l1)  ib(2l1)) = (2l+1). a key observation is that a constant
zero mode is excluded in the above expansion due to the nontrivial boundary condition.
inserting eq.(22) into eq.(6), we have, up to the quadratic terms with respect to (2l1),

e0[, r] =



xl=1

m2
(2l1)|(2l1)|2,

5

(23)

where

m2

2r !2
(2l1)  2 +  2l  1

.

(24)

the second term in eq.(24) is the kaluza-klein mass, which comes from the kinetic
2 (y(y))2, and which gives a positive contribution to the squared mass term. we
term 1
can easily see that for r  r1 all the squared masses m2
(2l1) are positive semi-denite
2r (cid:17)2
because of the induced kaluza-klein masses (cid:16) 2l1
. on the other hand, for r > r1 it
seems that negative squared masses appear. this is a signal of a phase transition and is

consistent with the results obtained before.

it may be interesting to point out that the translational invariance for the s1-direction

can be reinterpreted as a global u(1) symmetry, which is in fact possessed by the theory
after the compactication. to see this, we note that an innitesimal translation y  y + a
in eq.(22) can equivalently be realized, in terms of the fourier modes, by the following

transformation:

(2l1)  ei( 2l1
from which we may assign a u(1) charge 2l1
2r to (2l1). thus, spontaneous breakdown
of the translational invariance for the s1-direction may be interpreted as that of the

2r )a(2l1),

(25)

u(1) symmetry. one might then ask about a nambu-goldstone mode associated with

spontaneous breakdown of the translational invariance or the u(1) symmetry. it turns

out that, to answer the question, the following mode expansion is more suitable than the
fourier mode expansion for r > r1 [1, 2]:

(y) =



xl=1na(2l1)ec2l1(y, k) + b(2l1)es2l1(y, k)o ,

(26)

where ec2l1(u, k) and es2l1(u, k) are eigenfunctions of the so-called lame equation with

n = 2 [3]

"

d2

du2 + n(n + 1)k2sn2(u, k)# (u, k) = (k)(u, k),

with the boundary condition

(u + 2k(k), k) = (u, k).

(27)

(28)

the ec2l1(u, k) and es2l1(u, k) may further be supplemented by the following conditions
:

the eigenfunctions ec and es are dierently dened from those in ref.[3].

ec2l1(u, k) = +ec2l1(u, k),

6

es2l1(u, k) = es2l1(u, k),

and

ec2l1(u, k)

as k  0.

(29)

(30)

in the expansion (26), a(2l1) and b(2l1) correspond to normal modes around the back-
ground  = 1(y). if we set (k) = (1 + k2)(1 + m2
2 ), m2 may correspond to a squared
mass in (d  1)-dimensional minkowski spacetime. the lowest ve eigenvalues and
eigenfunctions for the lame equation with n = 2 are exactly known, and the eigen-

functions are given by so-called lame polynomials [3]. only two of them satisfy the
desired boundary condition (28), and are given by ec1(u, k)  cn(u, k)dn(u, k) and
es1(u, k)  sn(u, k)dn(u, k) with m2 = 0 and (cid:16) 3k2
1+k2(cid:17) 2, respectively. noting that
ec1(y, k)  d1(y)
mode associated with spontaneous breakdown of the translational invariance or the u(1)

, we know that the mode a(1) is really the massless nambu-goldstone

dy

symmetry.

we have shown that the translational invariance for the s1-direction is spontaneously

broken in the model (1) with the boundary condition (7) when the radius r becomes
larger than a critical radius r1. our mechanism to break the translational invariance is
not specic to this model at all. let us briey discuss a general strategy to construct

models in which the translational invariance of compactied spaces can be broken spon-

taneously. suppose that some of space dimensions are compactied on a manifold with

the translational invariance. let v (i) be a scalar potential. our mechanism may require

v (i) to satisfy the following two conditions:

(i) the origin j = 0 is not the minimum of the potential v (i).

(ii) let j be a conguration which minimizes v (i). then, some of j with j 6= 0

have to be non-singlets for some global symmetries of the theory.

a key ingredient of our mechanism is to impose nontrivial boundary conditions on
non-singlet elds j with j 6= 0, which have to be consistent with global symmetries of
the theory. we would have a variety of models since we have a wide choice of potentials,

compactied spaces and boundary conditions. a general feature of our models will be

7

that the translational invariance of compactied spaces is expected to be unbroken when

scales of the compactied spaces are suciently small and to be broken spontaneously

with some global symmetries when the scales become large enough.

finally, we would like to make some comments on vacuum structures of our models
and on an application to supersymmetric eld theories. in the limit of r  (k  1),
(y) in eq.(12) will reduce to q 2
 tanh(cid:16) 2(y  y0)(cid:17). this is nothing but a (static) single
kink solution in d = 2 dimensions [4]. so, the model considered here may be regarded as
a real 4 model on a single kink background sitting on a line in the limit of r  . this
observation suggests that models based on our breaking mechanism might be regarded as

quantum eld theories on (topologically) nontrivial backgrounds in a broken phase of the

translational invariance. the second comment is that vacuum structures of our models are

expected to be quite nontrivial, in general. to see this, let us consider a simple extension

of the model (1) by replacing the real eld  by a complex one  with a u(1) symmetry
and also the boundary condition (7) by (y + 2r) = ei2(y). one might expect that
the vacuum structure is similar to the original real 4 model. this is not, however, the

case. in fact, as studied in ref.[5], this model admits a rich set of solutions to the eld

equation for (y), and the vacuum conguration is quite dierent from that of the real
4 model k. the nal comment is that it would be worth applying our mechanism to

supersymmetric eld theories. in ref.[6], it has been shown that our mechanism can be

used to break supersymmetry spontaneously and that this susy breaking mechanism is

new, that is, it is dierent from the oraifeartaigh [7] and fayet-iliopoulos [8] mechanisms.

it would be of great importance to use this new susy breaking mechanism to construct

phenomenologically interesting supersymmetric models.
