abstract: we study the moduli space m of n = (4, 4) superconformal eld
theories with central charge c = 6. after a slight emendation of its global de-
scription we nd the locations of various known models in the component of m
associated to k3 surfaces. among them are the z2 and z4 orbifold theories ob-
tained from the torus component of m. here, so(4, 4) triality is found to play
a dominant role. we obtain the b-eld values in direction of the exceptional
divisors which arise from orbifolding. we prove t-duality for the z2 orbifolds
and use it to derive the form of m purely within conformal eld theory. for
the gepner model (2)4 and some of its orbifolds we nd the locations in m
and prove isomorphisms to nonlinear  models. in particular we prove that the
gepner model (2)4 has a geometric interpretation with fermat quartic target
space.

this paper aims to make a contribution to a better understanding of the n =
(4, 4) superconformal eld theories with left and right central charge c = 6. ulti-
mately, one would like to know their moduli space m as an algebraic space, their
partition functions as functions on m and modular functions on the upper half
plane, and an algorithm for the calculation of all operator product coecients,
depending again on m. this would constitute a good basis for the understanding
of quantum supergravity in six dimensions, and presumably for an investigation
of the more complicated physics in four dimensions.
the moduli space m has been identied with a high degree of plausibility, though
a number of details remain to be claried. it has two components, mtori and
mk3, one 16dimensional associated to the fourtorus and one 80dimensional
associated to k3. the superconformal eld theories in mtori are well under-
stood. one also understands some varieties of theories which belong to mk3,
including about 30 isolated gepner type models and varieties which contain orb-
ifolds of theories in mtori. in the literature one can nd statements concerning
intersections of these subvarieties, but not all of them are correct. indeed, their

2

w. nahm, k. wendland

precise positions in m had not been studied up to now. one diculty is due to
the fact that the standard description of mtori is based on the odd cohomology
of the torus, which does not survive the orbifolding.
as varieties of superconformal theories mtori and mk3 cannot intersect for
trivial reasons. as ordinary conformal theories without z2 grading intersections
are possible and will be shown to occur.

the plan of our paper is as follows. in section 1 we will review known results fol-
lowing [a-m,as2]. we correct some of the details and add proofs for wellknown
conjectural features. in section 1.1 we explain the connection between our de-
scription of mtori in terms of the even cohomology and the one given by narain
much earlier by odd cohomology [c-e-n-t,na]. both are eightdimensional,
and they are related by so(4, 4) triality. section 2 deals with z2 and z4 orb-
ifold conformal eld theories. we arrive at a description for the subvarieties of
these theories within mk3. in particular, we present a proof for the wellknown
conjecture that orbifold conformal eld theories tend to give the value b = 1
2
[as2, 4] to the b-eld in direction of the exceptional divisors gained from the
orbifold procedure and determine the correct b-eld values for z4 orbifolds. our
results are in agreement with those of [do,b-i], that were obtained in a dierent
context. we calculate the conjugate of torus t-duality under the z2 orbifolding
map to mk3 and nd that it is a kind of squareroot of the fouriermukai t-
duality on k3. this yields a proof of the latter and allows us to determine the
form of mk3 purely within conformal eld theory, without having recourse to
landau-ginzburg arguments. we disprove the conjecture that z2 and z4 orb-
ifold moduli spaces meet in the gepner model (2)4 [e-o-t-y]. we show that
the z4 orbifold of the nonlinear  model on the torus with lattice  = z4 has a
geometric interpretation on the fermat quartic hypersurface.

section 3 is devoted to the study of special points with higher discrete symmetry
groups in the moduli space, namely gepner models (actually (2)4 and some of its
orbifolds by phase symmetries). we stress that our approach is dierent from the
one advocated in [f-k-s-s,f-k-s] where massless spectra and symmetries of all
gepner models and their orbifolds were matched to those of algebraic manifolds
corresponding to these models. the correspondence there was understood in
terms of landau-ginzburg models, a limit which we do not make use of at all.
we instead explicitly prove equivalence of the gepner models under investigation
to nonlinear  models. this also enables us to give the precise location of the
respective models within the moduli space mk3. we prove that the gepner
model (2)4 is isomorphic to the z4 orbifold and therefore to the fermat quartic
model studied in the previous section. we moreover nd two meeting points of
mk3 and mtori generalizing earlier results for bosonic theories [k-s] to the
corresponding n = (4, 4) supersymmetric models. we nd a meeting point of
the moduli spaces of z2 and z4 orbifold conformal eld theories dierent from
the one conjectured in [e-o-t-y]. in section 4 we conclude by gathering the
results and joining them to a panoramic view of part of the moduli space (gure
4.1).
in the context of  models we must x our  conventions. for ease of notation
we use the rather unusual  = 1, so t-duality for a bosonic string compactied
r . we hoped to save us a lot of factors of 2
on a circle of radius r reads r 7 1
this way.

often, the leftright transformed analogue of some statement will not be men-
tioned explicitly, in order to avoid tedious repetitions. fourier components of
holomorphic elds are labelled by the energy, not by its negative.

we consider unitary two dimensional superconformal quantum eld theories.
they can be described as minkowskian theories on the circle or equivalently as
euclidean theories on tori with parameter  in the upper complex halfplane. the
worldsheet coordinates are called 0, 1.
the space of states h of a quantum eld theory has a real structure given by
cpt. for any n = (4, 4) superconformal theory h contains fourdimensional
vector spaces ql and qr of real left and right supercharges. since we consider
left and right central charge c = 6, we use the extension of the n = (2, 2)
superconformal algebra by an su(2) su(2) current algebra of level 1 [a-b-d+].
the (3+3)-dimensional lie group generated by the corresponding charges will
be denoted by su (2)susy
 su (2)susy
and its {(1 , 1 ), (1 ,1 )} quotient by
so(4)susy. the commutant of su (2)susy
in so(ql) will be called su (2)l. here
and in the following we use the notation so(w ) for the special orthogonal group
of a real vector space w with given scalar product.
one can identify su (2)susy
with su (2)l by selecting one vector in ql. the
subgroup of so(ql) which xes this vector is an so(3) group with surjective
projections to the two su (2) groups modulo their centers and allows an iden-
tication of the images. such an identication seems to be implicit in many
discussions in the literature, but will not be used in this section.
we will consider canonical subspaces of h spanned by the states with specied
conformal dimensions (h; h) which belong to some irreducible representation
of su (2)susy
. the latter are labelled by the charges (q; q) with
respect to a cartan torus of su (2)susy
. since any two cartan tori
are related by a conjugation, the spectrum does not depend on the choice of this
torus. charges are normalized to integral values, as has become conventional in
the context of extended supersymmetry.
we assume the existence of a quartet of spectral ow elds with (h, q; h, q) =
4 , 1; 1
( 1
4 , 2), i  {1}. operator products with each of them yield a combined
left+right spectral ow. instead of using n = (4, 4) supersymmetry it suces
to start with n = (2, 2) and this quartet. indeed, the operator product of a pair
of quartet elds yields lefthanded ow operators with (h, q; h, q) = (1,2; 0, 0),
and analogously on the righthanded side for another pair. these enhance the
u(1)susy
 u(1)susy
subalgebra of the n = (2, 2) superconformal algebra to an
a(1)
1  a(1)
1 kac-moody algebra. thus the n = (2, 2) superconformal algebra is
enhanced to n = (4, 4) [e-o-t-y].
our assumptions are natural in the context of superstring compactication.
there, unbroken extended spacetime supersymmetry is obtained from n = (2, 2)
worldsheet supersymmetry with spectral ow operators [se1,se2]. thus our su-
perconformal theories may be used as a background for n = 4 supergravity in
six dimensions. here, however, we concentrate on the internal conformal eld
theory. external degrees of freedom are not taken into account.

let us give a brief summary on what is known about the moduli space m so
far. the spaces of states of the conformal theories form a bundle with local
grading by nite dimensional subbundles over m. they can be decomposed
into irreducible representations of the left and right n = 4 supersymmetries.
the irreducible representations are determined by their lowest weight values
of (h, q). these representations can be deformed continuously with respect to
the value of h, except for the representations of non-zero witten index, also
called massless representations [e-t1,e-t2,ta]. apart from the vacuum rep-
resentation with (h, q) = (0, 0), the lowest weight states of massless represen-
tations are labelled by (h, q) = ( 1
2 ,1) in the neveu-schwarz sector and by
(h, q) = ( 1
4 , 0) in the ramond sector. let us enumerate
the representations which are massless with respect to both the left and the
right handed side. apart from the vacuum we already mentioned the spectral
ow operators with (h, q; h, q) = ( 1
4 , 2), i  {1}. they form a vector
multiplet under so(4)susy. since the vacuum is unique, there is exactly one
multiplet of such elds. on the other hand, the dimension of the vector space
of real ( 1
4 , 0) elds is not xed a priori. we shall denote it by 4 + . with a
slight abuse of notation, the orthogonal group of this vector space will be called
o(4+). these are all the possibilities of massless representations in the ramond
sector. the corresponding ground state elds describe the entire cohomology of
landau-ginzburg or  model descriptions of our theories [l-v-w].
if in a given model there is a eld with (h, q; h, q) = ( 1
2 ,1; 0, 0), application of
su(2)l and supersymmetry operators yields four lefthanded majorana fermions
and the corresponding abelian currents. as we shall see below, this suces to
show that the model has an interpretation as nonlinear  model on a torus, with
the currents as generators of translation and the fermions as parallel sections of
a at spin bundle. such models have  = 0 and constitute the component mtori
of m.
the vector space f1/2 spanned by the elds with (h, q; h, q) = ( 1
2 , 2), i 
{1} is obtained from the ( 1
4 , 0) ramond elds by spectral ow. thus it
gives an irreducible 4(4+)dimensional representation of su(2)susy
l su(2)susy
r 
o(4 + ). it determines the supersymmetric deformations of the theory, as will
be considered below.
the massless representations cannot be deformed, so  is constant over the
generic points of a connected component of m and can only increase over non-
generic ones. tensor products of a massive lefthanded representation with a
righthanded massless representation cannot be deformed either, since h h must
remain intergral. the span of such tensor products in the space of states yields
a string theoretic generalization e of the elliptic genus [s-w1,s-w2], which is
constant for all theories within a connected component of m. since for c = 6 and
theories with merely integer charges e is a theta function of level 2 and char-
acteristic q1, by its properties under modular transformations one can show
that e is a multiple of the elliptic genus ek3 of a k3 surface. according to their
charges, the numbers of ( 1

where by the above nl  {0, 2} also yields the number of left handed dirac
fermions. the uniqueness of the left and right elliptic genera shows nl = nr
and  = 16  8nl. moreover, left and righthanded elliptic genera have the same
power series expression. they vanish over mtori. in particular, as was anticipated
above, the existence of one eld with (h, q; h, q) = ( 1
2 ,1; 0, 0) suces to show
that the theory is toroidal. the elliptic genus on m is interpreted as index of
a supercharge acting on the loop space of k3 [wi1,wi2]. we call one of our
conformal eld theories associated to torus or k3, depending on the elliptic
genus. for the theories associated to k3 one has  = 16.
to understand the local structure of the moduli space m we must determine the
tangent space h1 in a given point of m, i.e. describe the deformation moduli
of a given theory. this space consists of real elds of dimensions h = h = 1 in
the space of states h over the chosen point. the zamolodchikov metric [za] on
the space of such elds establishes on m the structure of a riemannian mani-
fold, with holonomy group contained in o(h1). to preserve the supersymmetry
algebra, h1 must consist of so(4)susy invariant elds in the image of f1/2 un-
der (ql)1/2  (qr)1/2, where the latter subscripts denote fourier components.
accordingly, f1/2h1 yields a wellknown representation of the osp(2, 2) super-
algebra spanned by (ql)1/2, su(2)susy
and the virasoro operator l0. in partic-
ular, h1 should be 4(4 + )dimensional and form an irreducible representation
of su(2)l  su(2)r  o(4 + ). we shall assume that all elements of h1 really give
integrable deformations, as has been shown to all orders in perturbation theory
[di]. note, however, that there is no complete proof yet.
the holonomy group of m projects to an o(4 + ) action on the uncharged
massless ramond representations and to an so(4) action on ql  qr. thus
its lie algebra is contained in su(2)l  su(2)r  o(4 + ). the two lie algebras
are equal for mtori and one expects the same for  = 16. below we shall nd
an isometry from mtori to a subvariety of mk3, such that the holonomy lie
algebra of the latter space is at least su(2)l  su(2)r  so(4). moreover, this
isometry shows that mk3 is not compact. since one has the inclusion

su(2)  su(2)  o(4 + ) = sp(1)  sp(1)  o(4 + )  sp(1)  sp(4 + ),

the moduli space of n = (4, 4) superconformal eld theories with c = 6 associ-
ated to torus or k3 is a quaternionic kahler manifold of real dimension 4(4 + ).
to determine its local structure, recall that we are looking for a noncompact
space. by bergers classication of quaternionic kahler manifolds [be] it can
only be reducible or quaternionic symmetric [si, th. 9]. because nonricci at
quaternionic kahler manifolds are (even locally) de rham irreducible [wo], this
means that it can only be ricci at or quaternionic symmetric. the former is
excluded because geodesic submanifolds on which all holomorphic sectional cur-
vatures are negative and bounded away from zero have been found [p-s,c-f-g,
ce1]. hence the moduli space must locally be the wolf space

i.e. one component of the grassmannian of oriented spacelike fourplanes x 
r4,4+ [ce2], reproducing narains and seibergs previous results [c-e-n-t,na,
sei]. here so+(w ) denotes the identity component of the special orthogonal

6

w. nahm, k. wendland

group so(w ) of a vector space w with given scalar product. the space of max-
imal positive denite subspaces of w has two components, and o+(w ) denotes
the subgroup of elements of o(w ) which do not interchange these components.
note that for positive denite w we have so(w ) = o+(w ). the zamolod-
chikov metric on t 4,4+ is the group invariant one.
from the preceeding discussion, x can be interpreted as the so(4)susy invariant
part of the tensor product of ql qr with the four-dimensional space of charged
ramond ground states. note that the action of so(4) = su(2)l su(2)r discussed
above generates orthogonal transformations of the fourplane x  t 4,4+ corre-
sponding to the theory under inspection, whereas o(4 + ) acts on its orthogonal
complement.
we repeatedly used the splitting so(4) = su(2)l  su(2)r. consider the anti-
symmetric product 2x of the above fourplane x. we choose the orientation
of x such that su(2)l xes the antiselfdual part (2x) of 2x with respect
to the group invariant metric on o+(4, 4 + ; r). when the theory has a parity
operation which interchanges ql and qr, this induces a change of orientation
of x. the choice of an n = (2, 2) subalgebra within the n = (4, 4) supercon-
formal algebra corresponds to the selection of a cartan torus u(1)l  u(1)r of
su(2)l  su(2)r. this induces the choice of an oriented twoplane in x. the ro-
tations of x in this twoplane are generated by u(1)l+r, those perpendicular to
the plane by u(1)lr. thus the moduli space of n = (2, 2) superconformal eld
theories with central charge c = 6 is given by a grassmann bundle over m, with
bre so(4)/(so(2)l+r  so(2)lr) = s2  s2.
generic examples for our conformal theories are the nonlinear  models with
the oriented fourtorus or the k3 surface as target space x. in the k3 case,
the existence of these quantum eld theories has not been proven yet, but their
conformal dimensions and operator product coecients have a well dened per-
turbation theory in terms of inverse powers of the volume. we tacitly make the
assumption that a rigorous treatment is possible and warn the reader that many
of our statements depend on this assumption.
a nonlinear  model on x assigns an action to any twocycle on x. this action
is the sum of the area of the cycle for a given ricci at metric plus the image
of the cycle under a cohomology element b  h 2(x, r). since integer shifts of
the action are irrelevant, the physically relevant b-eld is the projection of b to
h 2(x, r)/h 2(x, z). thus the parameter space of nonlinear  models has the
form {ricci at metrics}{b  elds}. the corresponding teichmuller space is
(1.2)

t 3,3+  r+  h 2(x, r).

its elements will be denoted by (, v, b). the rst factor of the product is the
teichmuller space of ricci at metrics of volume 1 on x, the second parametrizes
the volume, and the last one represents the b-eld. the zamolodchikov metric
gives a warped product structure to this space. worldsheet parity transforma-
tions (0, 1) 7 (0, 1) change the sign of the cycles, or equivalently the sign
of b, which yields an automorphism of the parameter space.
target space parity for b = 0 yields a specic worldsheet parity transformation
and thus an identication of su(2)l with su(2)r. the corresponding diagonal lie
algebra su(2)l+r generates an so(3) subgroup of so(4). under the action of this
subgroup x decomposes into a line and its orthogonal threeplane   x. the
s2  s2 bundle over m now has a diagonal s2 subbundle. each point in the bre

a hikers guide to k3

7

corresponds to the choice of an so(2) subgroup of so(3) or a subalgebra u(1)l+r
of su(2)l+r. geometrically this yields a complex structure in the target space.
thus the s2 bundle over the b = 0 subspace of m is the bundle of complex
structures over the moduli space of ricci at metrics on the target space.
recall some basic facts about the teichmuller space t 3,3+ of einstein metrics on
an oriented fourtorus or k3 surface x. we consider the vector space h 2(x, r)
together with its intersection product, such that h 2(x, r) = r3,3+. in other
words, positive denite subspaces have at most dimension three, negative denite
ones at most dimension 3 + . on k3 this choice of sign determines a canonical
orientation. when one wants to study mtori by itself, the choice of a torus
orientation is superuous. our main interest, however, is the study of torus
orbifolds. for a canonical blowup of the resulting singularities one needs an
orientation. the eect of a change of orientation on the torus will be considered
below.
metric and orientation on x dene a hodge star operator, which on h 2(x, r)
has eigenvalues +1 and -1. the corresponding eigenspaces of dimensions three
and 3 +  are positive and negative denite, respectively. let   h 2(x, r)
be the positive denite threeplane obtained in this way. the orientation on x
induces an orientation on . one can show that ricci at metrics are locally
uniquely specied by , apart from a scale factor given by the volume. since the
hodge star operator in the middle dimension does not change under a rescaling of
the metric, the volume v must be specied separately. it follows that t 3,3+r+
is the teichmuller space of einstein metrics on x. explicitly, we have

t 3,3+ = o+(h 2(x, r))(cid:14)so(3)  o(3 + ).

(1.3)

could have been written as so+(h 2(x, r))(cid:14)so(3)  so(3 + ). we choose the

the so(3) group in the denominator is to be interpreted as so(0) for some
positive denite reference threeplane in h 2(x, r), while o(3 + ) is the cor-
responding group for the orthogonal complement of 0. equivalently, t 3,3+
description (1.3) for later convenience in the construction of the entire moduli
space.
for higher dimensional calabi-yau spaces the  model description works only
for large volume due to instanton corrections. in our case, however, the metric on
the moduli space does not receive corrections [n-s]. therefore the teichmuller
space (1.2) of  models on x should be a covering of a component of m, thus
isomorphic to the teichmuller space t 4,4+ obtained in (1.1). indeed, for  = 16
a natural isomorphism

t 4,4+ = t 3,3+  r+  h 2(x, r)

(1.4)

was given in [a-m,as2], with a correction and clarication by [r-w,di]. the
same construction actually works for  = 0, too. it uses the identication

t 4,4+ = o+(h even(x, r))(cid:14)so(4)  o(4 + ),

where so(4) is to be interpreted as so(x0) for some positive denite refer-
ence fourplane in h even(x, r), while o(4 + ) is the corresponding group
for the orthogonal complement of x0. in other words, the elements of t 4,4+
are interpreted as positive denite oriented fourplanes x  h even(x, r) by
h even(x, r) = r4,4+. note that all the cohomology of k3 is even, whereas
h odd(x, r) = r4,4 when x is a fourtorus.

8

w. nahm, k. wendland

to explicitly realize the isomorphism (1.4) one also needs the positive generators
 of h 4(x, z) and 0 of h 0(x, z), which are poincare dual to points and to the
whole oriented cycle x, respectively. they are nullvectors in h even(x, r) and
satisfy h, 0i = 1. thus over z they span an even, unimodular lattice isomorphic
to the standard hyperbolic lattice u with bilinear form

(cid:18) 0 1
1 0(cid:19) .

now consider a triple (, v, b) in the right hand side of (1.4). dene

 :   h even(x, r),
x := spanr(cid:16) () , 4 := 0 + b +(cid:16)v  kbk2

() :=   hb, i,

2 (cid:17) (cid:17) .

(1.5)

then e = () is a positive denite oriented threeplane in h even(x, r), and
the vector 4 is orthogonal to e. since k4k2 = 2v , it has positive square.
together, e and 4 span an oriented fourplane x  h even(x, r). obviously,

the map (, v, b) 7 x is invertible, once  and 0 are given.
to describe the projection from teichmuller space to m we need to consider
the lattices h 2(x, z) and h even(x, z). they are even, unimodular, and have
signature (p, p+ ) with p = 3 and p = 4, respectively. such lattices are isometric
to  p,p+ = u p  (e8(1))/8. here each summand is a free z module, e8 has
as bilinear form the cartan matrix of e8, and for any lattice  we denote by
 (n) the same z module  with quadratic form scaled by n.
we now consider the projection from teichmuller space to m. first we have to
identify all points in t 3,3+ which yield the same ricci at metric. this means
that we have to quotient the teichmuller space (1.3) by the socalled classical
symmetries. the projection is given by

o+(h 2(x, z))(cid:15)t 3,3+

(1.6)

[k-t]. here we use the notation o+( ) for the intersection of o+(w ) with the
automorphism group of a lattice   w . the interpretation of the quotient space
(1.6) as moduli space of einstein metrics of volume 1 on x is straightforward in
the torus case, but for x = k3 one has to include orbifold limits (see section 2).
the corresponding  models are not expected to exist for all values of b [wi3].
to simplify the discussion we include such conifold points in m. on t 4,4+ the
group of classical symmetries lifts by (1.5) to the subgroup of o+(h even(x, z))
which xes both lattice vectors  and 0.
next we consider the shifts of b by elements   h 2(x, z), which neither
change the physical content. one easily calculates that this also yields a left
action on t 4,4+ by a lattice automorphism in o+(h even(x, z)), generated by
w 7 whw, i for hw, i = 0 and 0 7 0 +  kk2
2 . these transformations
x  and shift 0 to arbitrary nullvectors dual to . thus the choice of 0 is
physically irrelevant.
we shall argue that the projection from teichmuller space to m is given by

t 4,4+  o+(h even(x, z))(cid:15)t 4,4+.

the group o+(h even(x, z)) acts transitively on pairs of primitive lattice vec-
tors of equal length [l-p,ni3]. thus (1.7) would imply that dierent choices of
, 0 are equivalent. anticipating this result in general, we call the choice of an
arbitrary primitive nullvector   h even(x, z) a geometric interpretation of a
positive oriented fourplane x  h even(x, z). such a choice yields a family of 
models with physically equivalent data (, v, b). a conformal eld theory has
various dierent geometric interpretations, and the choice of  is comparable to
a choice of a chart of m.
aspinwall and morrison also identify theories which are related by the world-
sheet parity transformation [a-m]. we regard the latter as a symmetry of m. it
is given by change of orientation of the fourplane x or equivalently by a conjuga-
tion of o+(h even(x, r)) with an element of o(h even(x, r))o+(h even(x, r))
which transforms the lattice h even(x, z) and the reference fourplane x0 into
themselves. to stay in the classical context, one may choose an element which
xes  and 0. more canonically, parity corresponds to (, 0) 7 (,0).
the latter induces 4 7 4 and (, v, b) 7 (, v,b).
let us consider the general pattern of identications. when two points in teich-
muller space are identied the same is true for their tangent spaces. higher
derivatives can be treated by perturbation theory in terms of tensor products of
the tangent spaces h1. assuming the convergence of the perturbation expansion
in conformal eld theory, any such isomorphism can be transported to all points
of t 4,4+. therefore  model isomorphisms are given by the action of a group
g() on this space. in the previous considerations we have found a subgroup of
g().
below we shall prove that the interchange of  and 0, which is the fourier-
mukai transform [r-w], also belongs to g(). when b = 0, this yields the map
(, v, 0) 7 (, v 1, 0). in the torus case, it is known as t-duality and it seems
natural to extend this name to x = k3. we will not use the name mirror
symmetry for this transformation.
it is obvious that classical symmetries, integral b-eld shifts, and t-duality
generate all of o+(h even(x, z)). thus g() contains all of this group. as argued
in [a-m,as2], it cannot be larger, since otherwise the quotient of t 4,4+ by
g() plus the parity automorphism would not be hausdor [al]. for a proof of
the hausdor property of m one will need some features of the superconformal
eld theories, which should be easy to verify once they are somewhat better
understood. first, one has to check that all elds are generated by the iterated
operator products of a nite dimensional subspace of basic elds. next one has to
show that the operator product coecients are determined in terms of a nite
number of basic coecients, and that the latter are constrained by algebraic
equations only. this would show that m is an algebraic space. in particular,
every point has a neighborhood which contains no isomorphic point. all of these
features are true in the known examples of conformal eld theories with nite
eective central charge, in particular for the unitary theories. they certainly
should be true in our case.
in the context of  models it often is useful to choose a complex structure
on x. when such a structure is given, the real and imaginary parts of any
generator of h 2,0(x, c) span an oriented two-plane   . conversely, any
such subspace  denes a complex structure. this means that the choice of
an einstein metric is nothing but the choice of an s2 of complex structures on

10

x, in other words a hyperkahler structure. in terms of cohomology,  species
h 2,0(x, c)  h 0,2(x, c). the orthogonal complement of  in h 2(x, r) yields
h 1,1(x, r). any vector   h 1,1(x, r) of positive norm yields a kahler class
compatible with the complex structure and the hyperkahler structure  spanned
by  and .
since h 2(x, z) is torsionfree for tori and k3 surfaces, the neron-severi group
n s(x) can be identied with p ic(x) := h 2(x, z)  h 1,1(x, r), the picard
lattice of x. by a result of kodairas, x is algebraic, if n s(x) contains an
element  of positive length squared [ko]. given a hyperkahler structure  we
can always nd    such that x becomes an algebraic surface. it suces to
choose  as the projection of  on  and  as the corresponding orthogonal
complement. the projection is non-vanishing, since the orthogonal complement
of  in h 2(x, r) is negative denite. varying  one obtains a countable innity
of algebraic structures on x. thus the occasionally encountered interpretation of
moduli of conformal eld theories as corresponding to nonalgebraic deformations
of k3 surfaces does not make sense (this was already pointed out in [ce2] by
dierent arguments).

as discussed above this selects a (2, 2) subalgebra of the (4, 4) superalgebra.
we will refer to the choice of such a twoplane as xing a complex structure.

the choice of    lifts to a corresponding choice of a two-plane e  x.
more precisely, the twoplane e species a complex structure in every geometric

interpretation of the conformal eld theory.

1.1. moduli space of theories associated to tori. originally, narain determined
the moduli space mtori of superconformal eld theories associated to tori by
explicit construction of nonlinear  models [c-e-n-t,na]. with the above for-
malism we can reproduce his description as follows.
let us consider tori of arbitrary dimension d. we change the notation by trans-
posing the group elements, which exchanges left and right group actions. this
yields

mn arain = o(d)  o(d)(cid:15)o(d, d)/o( d,d).

this moduli space has a symmetry given by worldsheet parity. we shall see that
its action on o(d, d) exchanges the two o(d) factors. for later convenience we

are going to use the cover so(d)  so(d)(cid:15)so+(d, d)/so+( d,d) of mn arain.

for even d this is a fourfold cover, for odd d a twofold one. the rspan of  d,d
is naturally isomorphic to rd  (rd), where rd is considered as an isotropic
subspace and w  denotes the dual of a vector space w , and analogously for
lattices. thus o(d, d) can be considered as the orthogonal group of a vector
space with elements (, ), ,   rd and scalar product
(, )  (, ) =    +   .

there is a canonical maximal positive denite d-plane given by  =  in rd 
(rd) = rd,d. the group so(d)  so(d) is supposed to describe rotations in
this d-plane and in its orthogonal complement. in this description, the parity
transformation consists of interchanging these two orthogonal d-planes, plus a
sign change of the bilinear form on rd,d.

a hikers guide to k3

now we use the isometry

v : so(d)(cid:15)gl+(d)  skew(d  d, r)  so(d)  so(d)(cid:15)so+(d, d) = t d,d

(1.8)

given by

v (, b) =(cid:18) (t )1 0

0 1 (cid:19) .
(cid:19)(cid:18) 1 b

0

(1.9)

(1.10)

we identify   gl+(d) with the image of zd under . finally we change
coordinates by pl := ( + )/2, pr := ( )/2, such that the scalar product
becomes

(pl; pr)  (pl; pr) := plpl  prpr.

this means that the positive denite d-plane is given by pr = 0 and its orthogonal

now described by the lattice

complement by pl = 0. altogether, with eb := (t )1b1 a point in mtori is
 (, b) =n (pl(, ); pr(, ))

:= 12 (cid:16)  eb + ;   eb  (cid:17)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) (, )    o .

(1.11)

the corresponding  model has the real torus t = rd/ as target space and
b  h 2(t, r) = skew(d  d, r) as b-eld. introducing d majorana fermions
1, . . . , d as superpartners of the abelian currents j1, . . . , jd on the torus one
constructs an n = (2, 2) superconformal eld theory with central charge c =
3d/2 which will be denoted by t (, b). from equation (1.9) it is clear that
integral shifts of b and lattice automorphisms yield isomorphic theories.
the theory is specied by its charge lattice  (, b). namely, to any pair (, ) 
   there corresponds a vertex operator v, with charge (pl(, ); pr(, ))
with respect to (j1, . . . , jd; 1, . . . , d) and with dimensions (h; h) = ( 1
2 p2
r).
thus h and h are the squares of the projections of (pl; pr) to the positive denite
d-plane and its orthogonal complement, respectively. in this description, the
parity operation is represented by the interchange of the latter two planes plus a
sign change in the quadratic form on rd,d. the transformations which exchange
the sheets of our covering of narains moduli space mn arain are given by target
space orientation change and tduality, as can be read o from equation (1.11).
the partition function of this theory is

are the classical theta functions and ( ) is the dedekind eta function. for ease
of notation we will write  = ( ), j (z) = j (, z), and j = j(, 0) in the
following.
by considering h1 one easily checks that all theories in mtori are described
by some even unimodular lattice  . we want to show that every such lattice

12

w. nahm, k. wendland

has a  model interpretation  =  (, b) (see also [as2]). choose a maximal
nullplane y  rd,d = rd  (rd) such that y     is a primitive sublattice.
apply an so(d)  o(d) transformation such that the equation of this plane
becomes  = 0. put y   = (, 0). next choose a dual nullplane y 0 such
that y  y 0 = rd,d and y 0     is a primitive lattice, too. existence of
y 0 can be shown by a gram type algorithm. then y 0 = {(b, ) |   rd}
for some skew matrix b, and  =  (, b). note that dierent choices of y 0
merely correspond to translations of b by integral matrices. so the geometric
interpretation is actually xed by the choice of y alone as soon as b is viewed
as an element of skew(d)/skew(d  d; z).
in this interpretation, rd is identied with the cohomology group h 1(rd/zd, r)
of the reference torus t = rd/zd. in addition to its dening representation,
the double cover of the group so+(d, d) also has half-spinor representations,
namely its images in so+(h odd(t, r)) and in so+(h even(t, r)). for d = 4 one
has the obvious isomorphism so+(4, 4) = so+(h odd(t, r)), which together
with so+(4, 4) = so+(h even(t, r)) yields the celebrated d4 triality [l-m,
i.8]. it is the latter automorphism which we will need in this paper, since the
odd cohomology of x does not survive orbifold maps.
note that for spin(4, 4) representations on r4,4 there is the same triality relation
as for spin(8) representations on r8, i.e. an s3 permuting the vector representa-
tion, the chiral and the antichiral weyl spinor representation. the role of triality
is already visible upon comparison of the geometric interpretations, where the
analogy between choices of nullplanes y, y 0 as described above and nullvectors
, 0 in (1.5) is apparent. indeed, part of the triality manifests itself in a one
to one correspondence between maximal isotropic subspaces y  r4,4 and null
weyl spinors  such that y = {y  rd,d | c(y)() = 0} where c denotes cliord
multiplication on the spinor bundle [b-t]. one can regard this as further justi-
cation for the interpretation of  as volume form which generates h 4(t, z) in
our geometric interpretation. recall also that in both cases dierent choices of
y 0, 0 correspond to b-eld shifts by integral forms.
we now explicitly describe the isomorphism (1.8) to show that it is a triality
automorphism. first compare (1.8) to (1.4) and notice that skew(4) = r3,3
which will simply be written skew(4)  b 7 b  r3,3 in the following. more-
over, because |det | is the volume of the torus t = rd/, we can decompose
so(4)\gl+(4) = so(4)\sl(4)  r+. now let t0 = r4/0 where 0 is a lat-
tice of determinant 1 and is viewed as element of sl(4). consider the induced
representation  of sl(4) on the exterior product 2(r4) which denes an iso-
morphism 2(0) = h2(t0 , z) for every 0  sl(4). because  commutes
with the action of the hodge star operator  and 2 = 1 on twoforms, sl(4) is
actually represented by so+(3, 3). in terms of coordinates as in (1.9) and with
 = v 1/40 = (1, . . . , 4), v = |det |, we can write
 (0) = v 1/2 (1  2 , 1  3 , 1  4 , 3  4 , 4  2 , 2  3)
 so+ (h2(t, r)) = so+(3, 3).

(1.13)

because so+(3, 3) = sl(4)/z2 and so(3)  so(3)/z2 = so(4) we nd
so(4)(cid:15)sl(4) = t 3,3 and all in all have
t 4,4

= so(4)(cid:15)gl+(4)  skew(4) = t 3,3  r+  r3,3

by (1.14) the geometric interpretation of a superconformal eld theory is trans-
lated from a description in terms of the lattice of the underlying torus, i.e.
in terms of  = h1(t, z), to a description in terms of h2(t, z) = 2().
this translation is essential for understanding the relation between the moduli
spaces mtori and mk3. to actually arrive at the description (1.4) in terms of
hyperkahler structures, i.e. in terms of h 2(t, z), we have to apply poincare du-
ality or use the dual lattice  instead of . this distinction will no longer be
relevant after theories related by tduality have been identied.
we insert the coordinate expressions in (1.9) and (1.5) into (1.14), write  =
v 1/40, v = |det | as before and arrive at

observe that (1.15) is a homomorphism t 4,4  t 4,4 and thus gives a natural
explanation for the quadratic dependence on b in (1.5). moreover, (1.15) reveals
the structure of the warped product (1.4) alluded to before. but above all on lie
algebra level one can now easily read o that (1.15) is the triality automorphism
exchanging the two half spinor representations v and s. namely, let h1, . . . , h4
denote generators of the cartan subalgebra of so(4, 4). here hi generates dila-
tions of the radius ri of our torus in direction i. since exp(hi) scales v 1/2
by e/2 and with (1.13) one then nds that (1.15) indeed is induced by the
triality automorphism which acts on the cartan subalgebra by

note that triality interchanges the outer automorphisms of so+(4, 4) related to
worldsheet parity and target space orientation.
triality considerations have a long history in superstring and supergravity theo-
ries, see for example [sha,cu,g-o]. concerning recent work, as communicated to
us by n. obers, so(4, 4) is crucial in the conjectured duality between heterotic
strings on the fourtorus and type iia on k3 [o-p1,k-o-p]. in connection with
the calculation of g(z) invariant string theory amplitudes one can use triality
to write down new identities for eisenstein series [o-p1,o-p2].
we now come to a concept which is of major importance in the context of calabi-
yau compactication and nonlinear  models, namely the idea of large volume
limit. a precise notion is necessary of how to associate a unique geometric inter-
pretation to a theory described by an even self dual lattice  when parameters
of volume go to innity. intuitively, because of the uniqueness condition, this
should describe the limit where all the radii of the torus in this particular geo-
metric interpretation are large. because in the charge lattice (1.11)    and
   are interpreted as winding and momentum modes, the corresponding

14

w. nahm, k. wendland

nullplane y should have the property

(1.16)

y   = spanzn 12

(; )  (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)kk2  1o

 spanzn (pl; pr)  (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)kplk2  1,kprk2  1o =: e .

because kplk2kprk2  z, for (pl; pr)  e we have kplk2 = kprk2. this shows y 
 = e because any (pl; pr) 6 y  = y must have large components. moreover, if

a maximal isotropic plane y as in (1.16) exists, then it is uniquely dened, thus
yielding a sensible notion of large volume limit. large volume and small volume
limits are exchanged by tduality.
for our embedding of torus orbifold theories into the k3 moduli space mk3 we
have to keep target space orientation. we also want to keep the leftright distinc-
tion in the conformal eld theory. torus tduality just yields a reparametriza-
tion of the theory and should be divided out of the moduli space. thus for us
the relevant moduli space of torus theories is given by

mtori = so(d)  o(d)(cid:15)o+(d, d)/o+( d,d).

notice that this is a double cover of mn arain.

(1.17)

1.2. moduli space of theories associated to k3 surfaces. we now give some more
details about the moduli space of conformal eld theories associated to k3 which
we will concentrate on for the rest of the paper, namely

mk3 = o+(h even(x, z))(cid:15)t 4,20

r

1/4, where h(4)

 su(2)susy

by (1.7). for other presentations see [a-m,r-w,di].
in the decomposition (1.4) we determine the product metric such that it be-
comes an isometry. in particular, it faithfully relates moduli of the conformal
eld theory to deformations of geometric objects. recall that the structure of
the tangent space h1 of mk3 in a given superconformal eld theory is best
understood by examining the ( 1
2 )-elds in f1/2. in our case we have re-
lated it to the su(2)susy
invariant subspace of the tensor product
1/4 denotes the charged and h(0)
ql qr h(4)
1/4 the uncharged
ramond ground states. the invariant subspace of ql  qr  h(4)
1/4 yields a four
plane with an orthogonal group generated by su(2)l  su(2)r. when a frame
in ql  qr is chosen, the latter tensor product factor can be omitted. the de-
scription of m implies that h(4)
1/4 has a natural non-degenerate indenite
metric and remains invariant under deformations, but it has not been understood
how this comes about. in terms of the fourplane x  t 4,20 giving the location
of our theory in moduli space, specic vectors in the tangent space txt 4,20 are
described by innitesimal deformations of one generator   x in direction x
that leaves   x invariant.
to formulate this in terms of a geometric interpretation (, v, b) specied by
(1.5), pick a basis 1, . . . , 19 of   h 2(x, r) = r3,19. then x is spanned
by {i hi, bi ; i = 1, . . . , 19} and 20 := 0 + b  (kbk2
2 + v ). in each of the
so(4) bres of h1 over i  hi, bi , i = 1, . . . , 19 we nd a threedimensional

1/4 h(0)

a hikers guide to k3

15

subspace deforming generators of  by i, as well as the deformation of b in
direction of i. the bre over 20 contains b-eld deformations in direction of
 and the deformation of volume. all in all, a 3  19 = 57 dimensional subspace
of h1 = txmk3 is mapped onto deformations of  by (1, 1)-forms    
h 2(x, r)  h 1,1(x, r), no matter what complex structure we pick in . the
23 dimensional complement of this subspace is given by 19 + 3 deformations of
the b-eld by forms   h 2(x, r) and the volume deformation.
one of the most valuable tools for understanding the structure of the moduli
space is the study of symmetries. so the next question to be answered is how
to translate symmetries of our superconformal eld theory to its geometric in-
terpretations. those symmetries which commute with the su(2)l  su(2)r action
leave the fourplane x invariant and are called algebraic symmetries. when the
n = (4, 4) supersymmetric theories are constructed in terms of (2, 2) supersym-
metric theories one has a natural framing. in this context, algebraic symmetries
are those which leave the entire vector space ql  qr of supercharges invari-
ant. more generally, any abelian symmetry group of our theory projects to a
u(1)l  u(1)r subgroup of su(2)l  su(2)r and xes the corresponding n = (2, 2)
subalgebra. when corresponding supercharges are xed, the abelian symmetry
group acts diagonally on the charge generators j, j of su(2)susy
 su(2)susy
.
the algebraic subgroup of this symmetry group is the one which xes these
charges.
if the primitive nullvector  specifying our geometric interpretation (, v, b) is
invariant upon the induced action of an algebraic symmetry we call the latter a
classical symmetry of the geometric interpretation (, v, b). because a classical
symmetry  xes x by denition we get an induced automorphism of h 2(x, r)
which leaves   h 2(x, r) and b  h 2(x, r)/h 2(x, z) invariant. moreover,
because 4 in (1.5) is invariant as well, 20 = 0 + b (kbk2
2 + v ) is xed. thus
 acts trivially on moduli of volume and b-eld deformation in direction of .
because  acts as automorphism on h 1,1(x, r) = h 2(x, r) for any choice
of complex structure    on x leaving the onedimensional h 1,1(x, r)  
invariant, all in all, x 7 (, v, b) maps the action of  to an automorphism of
2 , 1
h 2(x, r) which on h 1,1(x, r) has exactly the same spectrum as  on ( 1
2 )-
elds with charge, say, q = q = 1.
if the integral action of  on h 2(x, c) is induced by an automorphism  
aut(x) of nite order of the k3 surface x, then by denition, because  acts
trivially on h 2,0(x, c),  is an algebraic automorphism [ni2]. this notion of
course only makes sense after a choice of complex structure, or in conformal
eld theory language an n = (2, 2) subalgebra of the n = (4, 4) superconformal

r

l

algebra xing generators j, j, j, j of su(2)l su(2)r. still, because we always
assume the metric to be invariant under  as well, i.e.   h 2(x, r) , this is
no further restriction. on the other hand, given an algebraic automorphism  of
x which induces an automorphism of h 2(x, r) that leaves the b-eld invariant,
 induces a symmetry of our conformal eld theory which leaves j, j, j, j
invariant. this gives a precise notion of how to continue such an algebraic auto-
morphism to the conformal eld theory level.
we are thus naturally led to a discussion of algebraic automorphisms of k3 sur-
faces, which are mathematically well understood thanks to the work of nikulin
[ni2] for the abelian and mukai [mu] for the general case. the rst to explicitly

take advantage of their special properties in the context of conformal eld the-
ory was p.s. aspinwall [as1]. from [ni2, th. 4.3,4.7,4.15] one can deduce the
following consequence of the global torelli theorem:

theorem 1.1
let g denote an automorphism of h 2(x, c) of nite order which maps forms
corresponding to eective divisors of self intersection number 2 in p ic(x) to
forms corresponding to eective divisors. then g is induced by an algebraic

automorphism of x i(cid:0)h 2(x, z)g(cid:1)  h 2(x, z)  p ic(x) is negative denite

with respect to the intersection form and does not contain elements of length
squared 2.
if for a geometric interpretation (, v, b) of x  o+(h even(x, z))\t 4,20 we
have classical symmetries which act eectively on what we read o as h 2(x, c)
but are not induced by an algebraic automorphism of the k3 surface x by
theorem 1.1, then our interpretation of x as giving a superconformal eld theory
breaks down. such points should be conifold points of the moduli space mk3,
characterized by too high an amount of symmetry. one can regard nikulins
theorem 1.1 as harbinger of wittens result that in points of enhanced symmetry
on the moduli space of type iia string theories compactied on k3 the conformal
eld theory description breaks down [wi3].
by abuse of notation we will often renounce to distinguish between an algebraic
automorphism on k3 and its induced action on cohomology.
from mukais work [mu, th. 1.4] one may learn that the induced action of any
algebraic automorphism group g on the total rational cohomology h(x, q) is
a mathieu representation of g over q, i.e. a representation with character

(g) = (ord(g)), where for n  n : (n) :=

24
(1 + 1
p )

n qp prime,

p|n

.

(1.19)

it follows that

dimq h(x, q)g = (g) :=

1

|g|xgg

(ord(g))

(1.20)

[mu, prop. 3.4]. we remark that because g acts algebraically, we have
dimq h(x, q)g = dimr h(x, r)g = dimc h(x, c)g. by denition of al-
gebraic automorphisms h(x, c)g  h 0(x, c)  h 2,0(x, c)  h 0,2(x, c) 
h 2,2(x, c), so
(1.21)

(g)  4 = dimr h 1,1(x, r)g.

moreover, from theorem 1.1 we know that(cid:0)h 2(x, r)g(cid:1)  h 1,1(x, r) is nega-

tive denite, and because h 1,1(x, r) has signature (1, 19), we may conclude that
it contains an invariant element with positive length squared. thus (g)  5 for
every algebraic automorphism group g [mu, th. 1.4]. moreover [mu, cor. 3.5,
prop. 3.6],

finally let us consider the special case of an algebraic automorphism  of order
4, which will be useful in due course. by nk we denote the multiplicity of the

g 6= {1 } = (g)  16.

(1.22)

eigenvalue ik of the induced action  on h 1,1(x, c). because by (1.19) and
(1.20) (z4) = 10 and (z2) = 16, using (1.21) we nd n0 = 10  4 = 6, n2 =
16  4  n0 = 6. the automorphism  acts on the lattice h 2(x, z), so it must
have integer trace. on the other hand 20 = dimc h 1,1(x, c) = n0 + n1 + n2 + n3,
hence

n0 = n2 = 6, n1 = n3 = 4.

2. special subspaces of the moduli space: orbifold theories

this section is devoted to the study of theories which have a geometrical inter-
pretation on an orbifold limit of k3. we begin by giving a short account on the
relevant features of the orbifold construction, for details the reader is referred to
the vast literature, e.g. [d-h-v-w,di].
on the geometric side, the zl orbifold construction of k3 can be described as

follows [wa]: consider a fourtorus t , where t = t 2et 2 with two zl symmetric
twotori t 2 = c/l, et 2 = c/el which need not be orthogonal. let   zl act
algebraically on (z1, z2)  t 2  et 2 by (z1, z2) 7 (z1, 1z2). mod out this

symmetry and blow up the resulting singularities; that is, replace each singular
point by a chain of exceptional divisors, which in the case of zl-xed points have
as intersection matrix the cartan matrix of al1. in particular, the exceptional
divisors themselves are rational curves, i.e. holomorphically embedded spheres
with self intersection number 2. in terms of the homology of the resulting sur-
face x these rational curves are elements of h2(x, z) h1,1(x, c). to translate
to cohomology we work with their poincare duals, which now are elements of
p ic(x) with length squared 2. one may check that for l  {2, 3, 4, 6} this
procedure changes the hodge diamond by

and indeed produces a k3 surface x, because the automorphism we modded
out was algebraic. we also obtain a rational map  : t  x of degree l by this
procedure. to x a hyperkahler structure we additionally need to pick the class
of a kahler metric on x. we will consider orbifold limits of k3 surfaces, that
is use the orbifold singular metric on x which is induced from the at metric
on t and assigns volume zero to all the exceptional divisors. the corresponding
einstein metric is constructed by excising a sphere around each singular point
of t /zl and gluing in an eguchi hanson sphere e2 instead for l = 2, or a
generalized version el with boundary el = s3/zl at innity and nonvanishing
betti numbers b0(el) = 1, b2(el) = b2 (el) = l  1, i.e. (el) = l. the orbifold
limit is the limit these eguchi hanson type spheres have shrunk to zero size
in. the description (1.6) of the moduli space of einstein metrics of volume 1
on k3 includes orbifold limits [k-t], and as was shown by anderson [an] one
can dene an extrinsic l2-metric on the space e of regular einstein metrics of
volume 1 on k3 such that the completion of e is contained in the set of regular
and orbifold singular einstein metrics.

on the conformal eld theory side the orbifold construction is in total analogy
to the geometric one described above. assume we know the action of zl on the
space of states h of a conformal eld theory with geometric interpretation on
the torus t we had above. to construct the orbifold conformal eld theory, keep
all the invariant states in h and then  for the sake of modular invariance, if we
argue on the level of partition functions  add twisted sectors. for   zl, the
-twisted sector consists of states corresponding to elds  which are only well
dened up to -action on the world sheet of the original theory, that is  : z 
t, (0 + 1, 1) = (0, 1). z denotes the conguration space as mentioned in
the introduction and coordinates (0, 1), 0  0 +1, (0, 1)  (0 +0, 1 +1)
are chosen such that (0, 0) is a xed point. in other words, the constant mode
in the fourier expansion of  is a xed point p of . the other modes are of
non integral level, so the ground state energy in the twisted sector is shifted
away from zero. more precisely, the ground state |,pi of the -twisted sector
h,p belongs to the ramond sector and has dimensions h = h = c
4 . the
corresponding eld ,p introduces a cut in z from (0, 0) to (0, 1)  (0, 0) to
establish the transformation property (0 + 1, 1) = (0, 1) for |i  h,p ,
often referred to as boundary condition. the eld ,p is called a twist eld. for
explicit formulae of partition functions for zl orbifold conformal eld theories
see [e-o-t-y], for the special cases l = 2 and l = 4 we are studying here see
(2.3) and (2.14).
to summarize, we stress the analogy between orbifolds in the geometric and the
conformal eld theory sense once again; in particular, the introduction of a twist
eld for each xed point and boundary condition corresponds to the introduction
of an exceptional divisor in the course of blowing up the quotient singularity, if
we use the metric which assigns volume zero to all the exceptional divisors.
by construction orbifold conformal eld theories have a preferred geometric in-
terpretation in the sense of section 1.2. we will now investigate this geometric
interpretation for z2 and z4 orbifolds, particularly taking advantage of their
specic algebraic automorphisms. a program for nding a stratication of the
moduli space could even be formulated as follows: find all subspaces of theories
having a geometric interpretation (, v, b) with given algebraic automorphism
group g. relations between such subspaces may be described by the modding out
of algebraic automorphisms. any innitesimal deformation of  by an element of
h 1,1(x, r)g will preserve the symmetries in g, as well as volume deformations
and b-eld deformations by elements in h 2(x, r)g. the subspace of theories
with given classical symmetry group g in a geometric interpretation therefore
can maximally have real dimension 3((g)  5) + 1 + (g)  2 = 4((g)  4)
in accord with (1.21). in particular, for the minimal value (g) = 5, the only
deformations preserving the entire symmetry are deformations of volume and
those of the b-eld by elements of .
of course, the above program is far from utterly realizable, even in the pure
geometric context, but it might serve as a useful line of thought. z2 orbifolds
actually yield the rst item of this program: we can map the entire torus moduli
space into the k3 moduli space by modding out the symmetry z 7 z. the
description is straightforward if we make use of the geometric interpretation of
torus theories given by the triality automorphism (1.14), because the geometric
data then turn out to translate in a simple way into the corresponding data on
k3.

2.1. z2 orbifolds in the moduli space. some comments on z2 orbifold conformal
eld theories as described at the beginning of the section are due, before we
can show where they are located within the moduli space mk3. we denote the
z2 orbifold obtained from the nonlinear  model t (, bt ) by k(, bt ). if the
theory on the torus has an enhanced symmetry g we frequently simply write
g/z2, e.g. su (2) 4
in the nonlinear  model on the torus t = r4/ as described in section 1.1 the
current jk generates translations in direction of coordinate xk. this induces a
natural correspondence between tangent vectors of t and elds of the nonlinear
 model which is compatible with the so(4) action on the tangent spaces of t
and the moduli space, respectively. after selection of an appropriate framing
of ql  qr to identify su(2)susy
l,r with su(2)l,r as described in section 1 the
k are the superpartners of the jk. hence the choice of complex coordinates

this orbifold model has an n = (16, 16) supersymmetry. we are interested
in deformations which conserve n = (4, 4) subalgebras. as explained in sec-
tion 1, the latter are given by chiral and antichiral ( 1
2 )elds. generically,
2 , 1
the neveu-schwarz sector contains 144 elds with dimensions (h, h) = ( 1
2 ).
their quantum numbers under (j, a; j , a) are (1, 2; 3, 4), i  {1} (16
elds), (1, 0; 3, 0) (64 elds), and (0, 2; 0, 4) (64 elds). the 80 elds which are
charged under (j; j) yield the n = (4, 4) supersymmetric deformations which
conserve the superalgebra that contains the j currents. the 80 elds which
are charged under (a; a) yield deformations conserving a dierent n = (4, 4)
superalgebra. the latter corresponds to the opposite torus orientation.
let us now focus on the description of the resulting geometric objects, namely
kummer surfaces denoted by k() if obtained by the z2 orbifold procedure from
the fourtorus t = r4/. generators of the lattice  are denoted by 1, . . . , 4.
from (1.14) we obtain an associated threeplane t  h 2(t, r), i.e. an einstein
metric on t , and we must describe how the teichmuller space t 3,3 of einstein
metrics of volume 1 on the torus is mapped into the corresponding space t 3,19
for k3. this is best understood in terms of the lattices h 2(t, z) =  3,3 and
h 2(x, z) =  3,19, x = k(). in our notation h 2(t, z) is generated by j 
k, j, k  {1, . . . , 4} if (1, . . . , 4) is the basis dual to (1, . . . , 4). t is dened
by its relative position to a reference lattice  3,3 = h 2(t, z)  h 2(t, r). note
that in order to simplify the following argumentation we rather regard t 
h 2(t, z) as giving the position of the lattice h 2(t, z) = spanz(j  k) relative
to a xed threeplane spanr(e1  e2 + e3  e4, e1  e3 + e4  e2, e1  e4 + e2  e3)
with respect to the standard basis (e1, . . . , e4) of r4.
to make contact with the theory of kummer surfaces we pick a complex structure
2p4
t  t . the z2 action on t has 16 xed points 1
k=1 kk,   f4
2. we can
therefore choose indices in f4
2 to label the xed points1. note that this is not only
a labelling but the torus geometry indeed induces a natural ane f4
2-structure
on the set i of xed points [ni1, cor. 5]. the twoforms corresponding to the 16
exceptional divisors obtained from blowing up the xed points are denoted by
{ei | i  i}. they are elements of p ic(x) no matter what complex structure
we choose, because we are working in the orbifold limit, i.e. ei    i  i. let
  p ic(x) denote the primitive sublattice of the picard lattice that contains
{ei | i  i}. it is called kummer lattice and by [ni1, th. 3]:
theorem 2.1
the kummer lattice  is spanned by the exceptional divisors {ei | i  i} and
2pih ei | h  i is a hyperplane}. on the other hand, a k3 surface x is a
{ 1
kummer surface i p ic(x) contains a primitive sublattice isomorphic to .

let  : t  x be the degree two map from the torus to the orbifold singular
kummer surface. using poincare duality, one gets maps  from the homology
and cohomology groups of t to those of x, and  in the other direction. in
particular, this gives the natural embedding  : h 2(t, z)(2)  h 2(x, z) (here
 (2) denotes  with quadratic form scaled by 2). the image lattice will be called
k. we prefer to work with metric isomorphisms and therefore denote the image

in k of an element a  h 2(t, z) by 2a. in particular, we write 2jk, j, k =

contained in the dual lattice k  . the threeplane   h 2(x, r) which
describes the location of the singular kummer surface within the moduli space
(1.6) of einstein metrics of volume 1 on k3 is given by  = t .

morphism (2.5) provides a natural primitive embedding k    h 2(x, z),

hence  3,3(2) = h 2(t, z)(2)  h 2(x, z) =  3,19 is naturally embedded, and
in particular   h 2(x, r) = h 2(x, z)  r is obtained directly by regarding
t  h 2(t, r) = h 2(t, z)  r  h 2(x, z)  r as threeplane in h 2(x, r).
to describe where the image k(, bt ) of a superconformal eld theory t (, bt )
under z2 orbifold is located in mk3 we now generalize the above construction
to the quantum level. we have to lift  to an embeddingb : h even(t, z)(2) 
h even(x, z). the image will be denoted by bk. apart from j  k the lattice
h even(t, z) has generators , 0 as dened in (1.5). note that bk cannot be
embedded as primitive sublattice in  4,20 such that bk   because bk/bk =
(z2)8 6= (z2)6 = /. this means that the b-eld of the orbifold theory must
have components in the picard lattice.
the torus model is given by a fourplane xt  h even(t, r), the corresponding
orbifold model by its image x =bxt in h even(x, z)r. to arrive at a complete
description, we must nd the embedding of h even(x, z) in bk  r + h 2(x, r).
since scalar products with elements of bk must be integral and 20  bk, every
a   must have a lift 12
 +a or 0+a in h even(x, z). those elements for which
the lift has the form 0 + a must form an o+(h even(t, z)) invariant sublattice
of . one may easily check that this sublattice cannot contain the exceptional
divisors ei, i  i. moreover, as unimodular lattice h even(x, z) must contain an
element of the form 12
0 + a with a  . one nds that h even(x, z) must
contain the set of elements

 h even(x, z) =  4,20. as in the case of embedding the teichmuller spaces
t 3,3  t 3,19 this enables us to directly locate the image under z2 orbifold of a
conformal eld theory corresponding to a fourplane x  h even(t, r) =  4,4r

comparison with (1.5) directly gives the assertion of the theorem.


theorem 2.3 makes precise how the statement that orbifold conformal eld the-
ories tend to give value b = 1
2 to the b-eld in direction of exceptional divisors
[as2, 4] is to be understood. note that x   4,20 does not contain vectors
of length squared 2, namely ei  x,keik2 = 2 but ei 6 h even(x, z). in
the context of compactifactions of the type iia string on k3 this proves that
z2 orbifold conformal eld theories do not have enhanced gauge symmetry. a
similar statement was made in [as1] and widely spread in the literature, but we
were unable to follow the argument up to our result of theorem 2.3.

2.2. tduality and fouriermukai transform. by theorem 2.3 any automor-
phism on the teichmuller space t 4,4 of mtori is conjugate to an automorphism
on the teichmuller space t 4,20 of mk3. in particular, nonlinear  models on tori
related by tduality must give isomorphic theories on k3 under z2 orbifolding.
to show this explicitly and discuss the duality transformation on mk3 obtained
this way is the object of this subsection.
for simplicity rst assume that our  model on the torus t = r4/ has van-
ishing b-eld, where we have chosen a geometric interpretation (t , vt , 0).
then tduality acts by (t , vt , 0) 7 (t , 1/vt , 0). by theorem 2.3 the corre-
sponding z2 orbifold theories have geometric interpretations (, vt /2, b) and
(, 1/2vt , b), respectively, where  is obtained as image of the embedding
t  h 2(t, r)  h 2(x, r) and b = 1
struct an automorphism  of the lattice h even(x, z) which xes the fourplane
x corresponding to the model with geometric interpretation (, vt /2, b) and
acts by vt /2 7 1/2vt . in other words, we will explicitly construct the duality
transformation induced by torus tduality on mk3. our transformation  be-
low was already given in [r-w] but not with complete proof. within the context
of boundary conformal eld theories, in [b-e-r] it was shown that  induces
an isomorphism on the corresponding conformal eld theories. the relation to
the fouriermukai transform which we will show in theorem 2.4 has not been
claried up to now.

invariant, too, i.e. invariant under the transformation vt 7 1/vt . hence

by (1.5), the fourplane x  h even(x, z) is spanned by e = () and the
vector 4 =b0 + b + ( vt
2 + 1)b (notations as in theorem 2.3). because by the
above  xes x and e pointwise, the unit vector 4/vt    x must be
+pvt(cid:17)e

for any value of vt . we sete := (b),e0 := (b0) etc. and deduce
e0 + eb +e = 1
2b,
the rst equation together with heb,ei = heb,e0i = 0,kebk2 = 2 implies
heb,bi = 4 and justies the ansatz
icei + ab = xii

the only solutions satisfyingpii icei  h even(x, z), which must be true by
(2.9), are i0  {0, 2} for some i0  i and i = 1 for i 6= i0, correspondingly
a  { 7
2}. we conclude that if the automorphism  exists, then it is already
uniquely determined up to the choice of a and of one point i0  i. the two
possible choices of a turn out to be related by the b-eld shift eb 7 eb2eb = eb
and yield equivalent results. in the following we pick a =  7

one easily checks that eu := spanz(e,e0) = u . by e we denote the orthogonal
complement of eu in spanz(b,b0)   = u  , where  is the kummer lattice

of x as introduced in theorem 2.1. note that in i there are 15 hyperplanes
hi, i  i0 = i  {i0} which do not contain i0. the label i  i0 is understood as
the vector dual to the hyperplane hi. since the choice of i0 can be seen as the
choice of an origin in the ane space f4

space, and we have a unique natural isomorphism (f4

chosen such that eb = 1
since hfei,feji = 2ij, one has e = . hence (cei) =fei is a continuation of
(2.10) to an automorphism of lattices u   = eu  e, and we nd 2 = 1 .

note that the action of  can be viewed as a duality transformation exchanging
vectors i  i with hyperplanes hi, i  i. twoplanes p  i are exchanged
with their duals p  which shows that  can be continued to a map on the entire
lattice h(x, z) consistently with (2.5). the induced action on k = h 2(t, z)
leaves  invariant. we also see that the above procedure is easily generalized to
arbitrary nonlinear  models t (, bt ).

(2.11) one has s = tf m , where tf m is the fourier-mukai transformation

let s denote the classical symmetry which changes the sign of ce i0 and leaves
the other lattice generators cei, i 6= i0, b, b0, j  k invariant. by (2.10) and
which exchangesb with b0. since tf m = s, all in all we have

theorem 2.4
torus tduality induces a duality transformation  as given by (2.10) and (2.11)
on the subspace of mk3 of theories associated to kummer surfaces in the orb-
ifold limit (see also [r-w]). the fouriermukai transform tf m which exchanges

map on theories associated to the torus.

b withb0 is conjugate to a classical symmetry s by the image  of the t-duality

note that by theorem 2.4 we can prove aspinwalls and morrisons descrip-
tion (1.7) of the moduli space mk3 purely within conformal eld theory with-
out recourse to landauginzburg arguments. namely, as explained in section
1, the group g(16) needed to project from the teichmuller space (1.1) to the

a hikers guide to k3

25

component mk3 of the moduli space contains the group o+(h 2(x, z)) of clas-

sical symmetries which x the vectors b,b0 determining our geometric inter-
pretation. moreover, for any primitive nullvector e0 with hb,e0i = 1 there
exists an element eg  g(16) such that egb = b and egb0 = e0. by theorem
2.4 the symmetry tf m  o+(h even(x, z)) which exchanges b and b0 and

leaves x invariant also is an element of g(16), thus o+(h even(x, z))  g(16)
and o+(h even(x, z)) = g(16) under the assumption that mk3 is hausdor, as
argued in section 1.

2.3. algebraic automorphisms of kummer surfaces. to describe strata of the
moduli space mk3 we will study subspaces of the kummer stratum found above
which consist of theories with enhanced classical symmetry groups in the geo-
metric interpretation given there. concentrating on the geometric objects rst,
in this subsection we investigate algebraic automorphisms of kummer surfaces
which x the orbifold singular metric. such an automorphism induces an au-
tomorphism of the kummer lattice  because by k = h 2(t, z)(2) and (2.5)
all the lattice vectors of length squared 2 in  belong to , and   r by
theorem 2.1 is spanned by the lattice vectors ei, i  i of length squared 2.
vice versa,

lemma 2.5
the action of an algebraic automorphism  which xes the orbifold singular
metric on a kummer surface x is uniquely determined by its action on the set
{ei | i  i} of forms corresponding to exceptional divisors, i.e. by an ane
transformation a  a(i).
proof:
let  denote the induced automorphism on the kummer lattice . by theorem
2.1 and (2.5) the intersection form on  is negative denite and the ei, i  i
are the only lattice vectors of length squared 2. therefore,  is uniquely
determined by (ei) = i()ea(i) for i  i, where i()  {1} and a 
a(i). actually, i() = i(a), because a(i) = 1 = i() = 1 for otherwise
ei  (h 2(x, z) ) with length squared 2 contradicting theorem 1.1. assume
a = a for another algebraic automorphism  xing the metric. then g :=
(1  ) acts trivially on , and because  is xed by g as well, for the group
g generated by 1   we nd (g)  2 + 3 + 16 = 21. now (1.22) shows that
g is trivial, proving  = .

by abuse of language in the following we will frequently use the induced action
of an algebraic automorphism on  or in a(i) as a shorthand for the entire
action.

theorem 2.6
for every kummer surface x the group of algebraic automorphisms xing the
orbifold singular metric contains f4
2  a(i), which acts by translations on i.

proof:
any translation ti  a(i) by i  i acts trivially on /. thus ti can be
continued trivially to h 2(x, z) by (2.5). one now easily checks that the resulting
automorphism of h 2(x, c) satises the criteria of theorem 1.1.

one may now easily check that the automorphisms (2.13), viewed as automor-
phisms on h 2(x, c), satisfy the criteria of theorem 1.1 and thus indeed are
induced by algebraic automorphisms of x.
to see that g+
kummer does not contain any further elements, by lemma 2.5 it will
suce to show that no other element of aut() can be continued to h 2(x, z)
consistently such that it satises the criteria of theorem 1.1. because all the
translations of i are already contained in g+
kummer we can restrict our investiga-
tion to those elements a  gl(f4
2)  a(i) which can be continued to h 2(x, z)
preserving the symplectic forms on f4
2 that correspond to (2.12). after some cal-
culation one nds that a must commute with all the transformations listed in
(2.13). this means that a acts on i by akl(i) = akl(i) + |i|(1, 1, 1, 1),|i| =
kummer, where
a(i) = i + |i|(1, 1, 1, 1). a leaves invariant a sublattice of  of rank 12. but

2.4. z4 orbifolds in the moduli space. this subsection is devoted to the study
of z4 orbifolds in the moduli space mk3. we rst turn to some features of the
z4 orbifold construction on the conformal eld theory side which need further
discussion. from what was said at the beginning of the section, in terms of
complex coordinates (2.1) on t = r4/ the z4 action on the nonlinear  model
is given by ((1)
 ). from (2.2) we readily read o that
there always is a surviving su(2)1u(1) subalgebra of the holomorphic w-algebra
generated by j, j, a. to have a z4 symmetry on the entire space of states of the
torus theory, the charge lattice (1.11) must obey this symmetry. so in addition
to picking a z4 symmetric torus, i.e. a lattice  generated by i = riz2, ri 
r, i = 1, 2, we must have an appropriate b-eld bt in the nonlinear  model
on t which preserves this symmetry. in terms of cohomology we need bt 
h 2(t, r)z4 = spanr (1  2, 3  4, 1  3 + 4  2, 1  4 + 2  3). as
in section 2.1 (1, . . . , 4) denotes a basis dual to (1, . . . , 4), i being generators
of  and t  h 2(t, r) is regarded as giving the position of h 2(t, z) relative
to a xed threeplane spanr(e1  e2 + e3  e4, e1  e3 + e4  e2, e1  e4 + e2  e3).
to determine the partition function, a lengthy but straightforward calculation
using [e-o-t-y, (5.2)-(5.5)] shows

where for z,bt ( ) one has to insert the expression for the specic torus t
as obtained from (1.12). comparing to (2.3) the partition function (2.14) co-
incides with that of the z2 orbifold of a theory whose ns-partition function
is the expression in curly brackets in (2.14). indeed, the partition function of
su (2) 4
1 /z4, i.e. of the z4 orbifold of t = r4/z4 with bt = 0, agrees with
that of the z2 orbifold k(d4, 0) [e-o-t-y]. in section 2.1 we showed that every
z2 orbifold conformal eld theory has an su(2) 2
1 subalgebra of the holomorphic
w-algebra. on the other hand, as demonstrated above, the z4 orbifold gener-
ically only possesses an su(2)1  u(1) current algebra. for su (2) 4
1 /z4 this is
enhanced to su(2)1  u(1)3 which still does not agree with the one for kummer
surfaces. hence although the theories have the same partition function, they are
not isomorphic.
similarly, the partition function of the z4 orbifold of the torus model with so(8)1
symmetry agrees with that of k(z4, 0) as can be seen from (3.7). in this case
the theories indeed are the same as will be shown in theorem 3.9.
to have a better understanding of their location within the moduli space and
their geometric properties we now construct z4 orbifolds by applying another
orbifold procedure to theories with enhanced symmetries which have already
been located in moduli space.

theorem 2.8

kummer, blowing up the singularities and using

let e denote a lattice generated by i = riz2, ri  r, i = 1, 2. consider the
k3 surface x obtained from the kummer surface k(e) by modding out the
algebraic automorphism r12  eg+
the induced orbifold singular metric. then x is the z4 orbifold of t = r4/e.

proof:
by construction (2.13), r12 is induced by the automorphism (x1, x2, x3, x4) 7
(x2, x1, x4,x3) with respect to standard coordinates on t . in terms of com-
plex coordinates as in (2.1) this is just the action  : (z1, z2) 7 (iz1,iz2), and
because k() = ]t /2, the assertion is clear.

remark:
study gure 2.1 to see how the structure a6

1  a4

3 of the exceptional divisors in

the z4 orbifold comes about: twelve of the xed points in k(e) are identied

pairwise to yield six z2 xed points in the z4 orbifold, that is a6
1. the four points
labelled i  {(0, 0, 0, 0), (1, 1, 0, 0), (0, 0, 1, 1), (1, 1, 1, 1)} are true z4 xed points.
the induced action of r12 on the corresponding exceptional divisor cp1 = s2 is
just a 180 rotation about the north-south axis, and north and south poles are
xed points. blow up the resulting singularities in k()/r12 to see how an a3
arises from the a1 over each true z4 xed point.
for a z4 orbifold x there is an analog
of the kummer lattice  described
in theorem 2.1, the primitive sublattice of p ic(x) containing all the twoforms
which correspond to exceptional divisors by poincare duality. we will give an
as for  in lemma 2.9 below. the embedding of
analogous description of
the moduli space of z4 orbifolds in mk3 then works analogously to that of z2
orbifold conformal eld theories as described in subsection 2.1.
let us x some notations. let  : t  x denote the rational map of degree
four. then k := h 2(t, z)z4 = spanz (21  2, 23  4, 1  3 + 4  2,
1  4 + 2  3). for the twoforms corresponding to the exceptional divisors

of the z4 orbifold we adopt the labelling of xed points by i = f4
2 as used in
the z2 orbifold case. here, we have six z2 xed points labelled by i  i (2) :=
{(j1, j2, 1, 0), (1, 0, j3, j4) | jk  f2}. the four true z4 xed points are labelled
by i  i (4) := {(i, i, j, j) | i, j  f2}. the corresponding twoforms are denoted
by ei for i  i (2), and for each z4 xed point i  i (4) we have three exceptional
divisors poincare dual to e()
i = 0.
for ease of notation we also use the combination ei := 3e(+)
if
i  i (4).
as a rst step we determine the analogs of (2.5) and (2.6) in order to describe
 h 2(x, z). by (2.5) images   k of
the primitive embedding k 
forms corresponding to torus cycles do not necessarily correspond to cycles in
h2(x, z). namely, the poincare dual of a representative  of   k/k built
from combinations of 1
2 j k can be interpreted as the  image of a torus cycle
which contains z4 xed points. it is not a cycle on x, since it has boundaries
where the exceptional divisors were glued in instead of the xed points by the
blow up procedure. since the discriminant forms of k/k and
agree
in the image of 
up to a sign, there is a representative  of  
whose poincare dual has the same boundary as  but orientation reversed. we
can glue a part  of a rational sphere into the boundary of  to obtain a cycle
 +   h 2(x, z), where up to a sign  has the same intersection number as 
with every exceptional divisor.
we again adopt the notation pjk = spanf2 (fj, fk) used in subsection 2.1. re-
member to count z2 xed points only once, e.g. p12 = {(0, 0, 0, 0), (1, 0, 0, 0),
(1, 1, 0, 0)}. we then have

have to lift the above picture to the quantum level. as before, h even(t, z) =  4,4

x  h even(x, z) does not contain vectors of length squared 2.
note that from (2.16) it is easy to read o the ow of the b-eld obtained from
the orbifold procedure through an a3 divisor over one of the true z4 xed points
of x: on integration over any of the divisors that correspond to a zm xed point,
we get beld ux 1
m . this is also true for the other zm orbifold conformal eld
theories and conrms earlier results [do,b-i] obtained in the context of brane
physics.
theorem 2.11 proves that z4 orbifold conformal eld theories do not correspond
to string compactications of the type iia string on k3 with enhanced gauge
symmetry. concerning the algebraic automorphism group of z4 orbifolds we can
prove
theorem 2.12

let x denote the z4 orbifold of t = r4/. then the group g of algebraic
automorphisms xing the orbifold singular metric of x consists of all the residual
symmetries induced by algebraic automorphisms of k() which commute with
r12. thus, generically g = f2
2 is generated by the induced actions of t1100 and
t0011. if   z4, g = d4 is generated by the induced actions of t1100 and r13.
if we want invariance of the conformal eld theory under the entire group g = d4
of algebraic automorphisms found in theorem 2.12 we must restrict bt to values
such that bt  h 2(t, r)z4  h 2(x, r)d4 =  where we regard h 2(t, r)z4 
h 2(x, r) as described in lemma 2.9. if bt is viewed as element of skew(4) acting
on r4 this condition is equivalent to bt commuting with the automorphisms
listed in (2.13).

transcendental lattice p ic(x)  h 2(x, z). in other words there is a one to one
correspondence between singular k3 surfaces and even quadratic positive de-
nite forms modulo sl(2, z) equivalence [shi]2. because (q)

lattice vectors, one now easily checks that x equipped with the complex struc-

3. special points in moduli space: gepner and gepner type models

finally we discuss the probably best understood models of superconformal eld
theories associated to k3 surfaces, namely gepner models [ge1,ge2]. the lat-
ter are rational conformal eld theories and thus exactly solvable. for a short
account on the gepner construction and its most important features in the con-
text of our investigations see appendix a. in this section, we explicitly locate
the gepner model (2)4 and some of its orbifolds within the moduli space mk3.
this is achieved by giving  model descriptions of these models in terms of z2
and z4 orbifolds which we know how to locate in moduli space by the results of
section 2.

3.1. discrete symmetries of gepner models and algebraic automorphisms of k3
surfaces. as argued before, a basic tool to characterize a given conformal eld
theory is the study of its discrete symmetry group. we will rst discuss the

central charge c = 6 and r even [ge1]. recall that this theory is obtained from
the fermionic tensor product of the n = 2 superconformal minimal models
(kj), j = 1, . . . , r, by modding out a cyclic group z = zn, n = lcm{2; ki + 2, i =
1, . . . , r}. the model therefore inherits a zkj +2 symmetry from the parafermionic
subtheories of each minimal model factor (kj) whose generator in the bosonic
sector acts by

assume we can locate our gepner model within mk3, that is we explicitly know
the corresponding fourplane x  h even(x, r) as described in section 1. fur-
thermore assume that by picking a primitive nullvector   h even(x, z) we have
chosen a specic geometric interpretation (, v, b). by construction, a gepner
model comes with a specic choice of the n = (2, 2) subalgebra corresponding to
a specic twoplane   . we stress that this is true for any geometric interpre-
structure a priori, it xes a choice of complex structure in every geometric inter-
pretation of our model, as was explained in section 1. still, we now assume our
k3 surface x to be equipped with complex structure and kahler metric. by our
discussion in section 1.2 we know that any symmetry of the gepner model which
currents j, j, j, j and the vector  invariant
leaves the su(2)susy
and

tation ofqj(kj): the choice of the n = (2, 2) subalgebra does not x a complex

may act as an algebraic automorphism on x. because j =(cid:0)0
j = (cid:0)0
(see appendix a) we conclude from (3.2) that elements of
galg
ab can act as algebraic automorphisms on x xing the b-eld b  h 2(x, r),
and vice versa. more explicitly by what was said in section 1.2, the action of such
2(cid:1)-elds with charges, say, q = q = 1 should
a gepner-symmetry on the (cid:0) 1
be identied with the induced action of an algebraic automorphism of x on
h 1,1(x, r). with reference to its possible geometric interpretation we call galg
the abelian algebraic symmetry group of the gepner model.
in the following subsections we will investigate where in the moduli space of
superconformal eld theories associated to k3 surfaces to locate the gepner
ab = (z4)2. from the
model (2)4 and some of its orbifolds by elements of galg

the geometric interpretation of its orbifold models is obtained by modding out
the corresponding algebraic automorphisms.
apart from symmetries in z2  gab our gepner model will possess permutation
symmetries involving identical factor theories. their discussion is a bit more
subtle, because as noted in [f-k-s] permuting fermionic elds will involve ad-
, meaning
that odd permutations can only act algebraically when accompanied by a phase

we will discuss this phenomenon in detail for the example of prime interest to
ab = (z4)2, and the entire algebraic
us, namely the gepner model (2)4. here galg
symmetry group is generally believed to be galg = (z4)2  s4 [as1]. more-
over, based on landau-ginzburg computations and comparison of symmetries
[g-v-w,g-p,f-k-s-s,as1] it is generally believed that (2)4 has a geometric in-
terpretation (q, vq, bq) given by the fermat quartic (2.17) in cp3. indeed,
q is a k3 surface with algebraic automorphism group (z4)2  s4 [mu], and
arguments in favour of the viewpoint that it yields a geometric interpretation of
(2)4 will arise from the following discussion. it is proved in corollary 3.6.

note rst that by (1.20) we have (z4  z4) = 6, in accordance with (1.21) and
2 = 6 4 invariant elds in the above table. one moreover easily checks that the
spectrum of every element g  galg
ab of order four agrees with the one computed
in (1.23) for algebraic automorphisms of order four on k3 surfaces. this is a
strong and highly non-trivial evidence for the fact that one possible geometric
interpretation of (2)4 is given by a k3 surface whose algebraic automorphism
group contains (z4)2.

action of s4, i.e. its spectrum on the (cid:0) 1

2 , 1

2(cid:1)-elds coincides with the spectrum

as stated above, further discussion is due concerning the action of s4 because
transpositions of fermionic modes introduce sign ips (a.9). in particular, odd
elements of s4 do not leave j invariant. to have an algebraic action of the
entire group s4 we must therefore accompany   s4 by a phase symmetry
a = [a1(), a2(), a3(), a4()]  gab which for odd  satises (3.3). thus a
transposition (, )  s4 must be represented by ((, )) = (, )  a(,) =
a(,)  (, ) in order to have ((, ))2 = 1 . with any such choice of  on
generators (j , j) of s4 one may then check explicitly that  denes an algebraic
of the algebraic automorphism group s4. namely, any element of order two (or
three, four) in s4 leaves (z2)  4 = 12 (or (z3)  4 = 8, (z4)  4 = 6) states
invariant, and elements of order four have the spectrum given in (1.23). note in
particular that by (3.3) with any consistent choice of  7 a the group s4 acts
by  7 sign() on y (1, 1, 1, 1) and trivially on x. this leaves x = (1
1,0;3,2)4
as the unique invariant state upon the action of (z4)2  s4 in accordance with
((z4)2  s4) = 5 and (1.21).
summarizing, we have shown that the action of the entire algebraic symmetry
group galg = (z4)2  s4 of (2)4 as described above exhibits a spectrum consis-
tent with its interpretation as group of algebraic automorphisms of a k3 surface,
e.g. the fermat quartic with geometric interpretation (q, vq, bq). remember
that (cid:0)galg(cid:1) = 5 is the minimal possible value of  by the discussion in sec-

3d/2 (d = 2 or d = 4) and spaces of states h1,h2, to prove their equivalence we
show the following:

i. the partition functions of the two theories agree sector by sector in the sense

of (2.4).

ii. the elds of dimensions (h, h) = (1, 0) in the two theories generate the same
algebra a = af ab, where af = u(1) for d = 2, af = su(2) 2
1 for d = 4, and
u(1)d  ab. in particular, u(1)c  a. af contains the u (1)-current j (1) = j
of the n = 2 superconformal algebra, and a second u (1)-generator j (2) if
d = 4. furthermore, the elds of dimensions (h, h) = (0, 1) in both theories
generate algebras isomorphic to a as well, such that each of the left moving
u (1)-currents j has a right moving partner .

and denote the u (1)-currents in u(1)d  ab by j1, . . . , jd. we normalize them
to

let jd+k  j (k), k  {1, d

malized to (3.6), too, and set j := (j1, . . . , jd; 1, . . . , d). the charge lattices

b and h2

of h1
b with respect to j are isomorphic to the same self dual lattice
b  rd;d; because the states in hi
b are pairwise local, in order to prove this
it suces to show agreement of the j -action on a set of states whose charge
vectors generate a self dual lattice b.

theorem 3.1

if i.-iii. are true then theories c1 and c2 are isomorphic (the converse generically
is wrong, of course).

b = h2

proof:
using i.-iii. we rst show h1
b =: hb. denote by v i[] the primary eld
corresponding to a state in hi
b with charge  = (l; r)  b. notice that in
both theories every charge   b must appear with multiplicity one, because
k []] = [1 i
k []] [v i
otherwise by fusing [v i
b with
vanishing charges under a total u(1)c  a in contradiction to uniqueness of the
vacuum. now for any  = (l; r),  = (l; r)  b we have

so it remains to be shown that we can arrange c1
, = c2
, for all ,   b
by normalizing the primary elds appropriately. in other words, we must nd
constants d  r for any   b such that  ,   b : c2

possible, because having xed d, d, d, d  r such that

etc. we automatically have c2
,. if more than two
of the six twopoint functions vanish, then by similar arguments the normalization
of one of the primaries is independent of the three others and a consistent choice
b = hb is
of d, d, d, d  r is therefore possible, too. the proof of h1
now complete.
because b is self dual, for any state |i  hi carrying charge  with respect to
j we have   b and thus nd vertex operators v i[]  hi
b. by ii. and iii.
t := 1
k=1(jk)2 acts as virasoro eld t i on each of the theories (check that

af contains the u (1)-current j of the total n = 2 superconformal algebra, the
partition functions of our theories agree by i., and we already know hi = hi

their superpartners are free majorana fermions 1, 2 with coupled boundary
conditions. by e1, e2 we denote the generators of the lattice  =  = z2
which denes our torus. then the (1, 0)-elds in the nonlinear  model are
given by the three abelian currents j = i21 (the u (1) current of the n =
2 superconformal algebra), q = j1 + j2, r = j1  j2, and the four vertex
operators vei,ei , i = 1, 2.

thus the (1, 0)-elds in the two theories generate the same algebra a =

iii. the space h1

( + ,   )(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)   d4,   d4o .

thus b is the charge lattice of the bosonic part of the  model c3 = t (d4, 0).
theory c1 was obtained by taking the ordinary z2 orbifold of the torus model
on tsu(2) 4
, but as pointed out in [k-s], for the bosonic part of the theory this is
equivalent to taking the z2 orbifold associated to a shift  = 1
(0; 0), 0 =
22
. under this shift orbifold, the lattices

b =n 12

pi ei   on the charge lattice of tsu(2) 4

 7  +(cid:0) + 1

2 0(cid:1) = d4,  7 {   |h0, i  0 (2)} = d4,

so the bosonic part of the resulting theory indeed is that of c3. the entire bosonic
sector of c1 = c2 agrees with that of c3, because the shift acts trivially on
fermions, and the ordinary z2 orbifold just interchanges twisted and untwisted
boundary conditions of the fermions in time direction. the dierence between
the theories merely amounts in opposite assignments of ramond and neveu-
schwarz sector on the twisted states resulting in dierent elliptic genera for the
k3-model c1 = c2 and the torus model c3. the fact that the partition functions
actually do not agree before projection onto even fermion numbers is not relevant
here because locality is violated before the projection is carried out. so, on the
level of conformal eld theory:

remark 3.4

the gepner type model c1 = (b2)4 viewed as nonlinear  model c2 on the

kummer surface k(z4, 0) is located at a meeting point of the moduli spaces
of theories associated to k3 surfaces and tori, respectively. namely, its bosonic
sector is identical with that of the nonlinear  model c3 = t (d4, 0).
this property does not translate to the stringy interpretation of our conformal
eld theories, though. when we take external degrees of freedom into account,
spin statistics theorem dictates in which representations of so(4) the external
free elds may couple to internal neveu-schwarz or ramond elds, respectively.
the theories c1 = c2 and c3 therefore correspond to dierent compactications
of the type iia string.

3.4. gepners description for su (2) 4

theorem 3.5

the gepner model ci = (2)4 admits a nonlinear  model description cii on
1 -lattice  = z4 and vanishing
the z4 orbifold of the torus tsu(2) 4
b-eld.

with su (2) 4

proof:

it is clear that ci = (2)4 can be obtained from c1 = (b2)4, for which we al-

ready have a  model description by theorem 3.3, by the z2 orbifold procedure
which revokes the orbifold used to construct c1. the corresponding action is
multiplication by 1 on h[2, 2, 0, 0]i-twisted states, i.e.

[2, 2, 0, 0] :

hence we have a surviving su(2)1  u(1)3 subalgebra of our holomorphic w-
algebra. in appendix b we give a list of all ( 1
with their description in the  model c2 on the z2 orbifold k(z4, 0). a similar
list can be obtained for the (2, 0)-elds as discussed in the proof of theorem 3.3.
from these lists and (3.13) one readily reads o that the states invariant under
(3.12) coincide with those invariant under the automorphism r12 on k(z4, 0) (see
theorem 2.7) which is induced by the z4 action (j1, j2, j3, j4) 7 (j2, j1, j4,j3),
i.e. ((1)
. the apper-
taining permutation of exceptional divisors in the z2 xed points is depicted in
gure 2.1. the action of r12 and that induced by (3.12) agree on the algebra a
of (1, 0)-elds and a set of states generating the entire space of states, thus they
are the same. because of c1 = c2 (theorem 3.3) and the fact that ci = (2)4 is
obtained from c1 by modding out (3.12), it is clear that modding out k(z4, 0)

by the algebraic automorphism r12 will lead to a  model description of (2)4. as
shown in theorem 2.8 the result is the z4 orbifold cii of tsu(2) 4

theorem 3.5 has been conjectured in [e-o-t-y] because of agreement of the
partition functions of ci and cii . this of course is only part of the proof as can
be seen from our argumentation in section 2.4. there we showed that su (2) 4
1 /z4
does not admit a  model description on a kummer surface although its partition
function by [e-o-t-y] agrees with that of k(d4, 0), too.
from theorem 2.13 and theorem 3.5 we conclude:

corollary 3.6
the gepner model (2)4 admits a geometric interpretation on the fermat quartic

corresponding (1, 1)-superpartners. in terms of gepner elds this means

indeed, v , are uncharged under j and a as they should, because both u (1)-
currents must survive deformations within the moduli space of z4 orbifold con-
formal eld theories. on the other hand by our discussion in section 3.1 the
(1, 1)-superpartners of (1
1,0;1,0)4, which carry (a; a)-charges
(1; 1), give the moduli of volume and corresponding b-eld deformation if we
choose the quartic hypersurface (2.17) as geometric interpretation of gepners
model (2)4. hence along the quartic line we generically only have an su(2)1-
algebra of (1, 0)-elds. this agrees with the analogous picture for c = 9 and the
gepner model (3)5 where all additional u (1)-currents vanish upon deformation
along the quintic line [d-g].

(1.21). we temporarilly leave the symmetry [1, 3, 0, 0] out of discussion, because

d4 = h(12), (13)(24)i  s4 is the commutant of [2, 2, 0, 0].
let us compare to the  model description k(z4, 0) of (b2)4: in theorem 2.7 the
group of algebraic automorphisms of k(z4, 0) which leave the orbifold singular
metric invariant was determined to g+
2. although it is iso-
morphic to the algebraic symmetry group (z2  z4)  d4 of (b2)4 found so far,
kummer must act dierently on (b2)4. namely, from the proof of theorem 3.5 we
g+
know that the  model equivalent of [2, 2, 0, 0] is r12  g+
kummer. thus only the
commutant h  g+
kummer of r12 can comprise residual symmetries descending
from the z4 orbifold description on (2)4. this is no contradiction, because by
the discussion in section 1.2 dierent subgroups of the entire algebraic symmetry
group of (b2)4 may leave the respective nullvector  invariant which denes the
symmetries of a given geometric interpretation. the gepner type model (b2)4 is
of theorem 3.3 (see appendix b) to determine the corresponding elements of bgalg

an example where the existence of such symmetries can be checked explicitly.
by the results of section 2.3 we nd h = z2  d4 = hr12, r13, t1100i (see also
theorem 2.12). we now use our state by state identication obtained in the proof

geometric interpretation. by what was said in section 1 it is actually no surprise
to nd symmetries of conformal eld theories which do not descend to classical

and nd

amplitudes of twist elds any n-point function containing an odd number of

the full group bgalg = (z2

consists of all the residual symmetries of (2)4 surviving both deformations along
the quartic and the z4 orbifold line and acting classically in both geometric

that the z2  z2 orbifold (e2)4 of (2)4 is invariant under mirror symmetry. this
(e2)4 = ec1.
the gepner type model ec1 = (e2)4, or equivalently the nonlinear  model ec2 =
k( 12
d4, b), b given by (3.16), is located at a meeting point of the moduli
spaces of theories associated to k3 surfaces and tori, respectively. namely, its
bosonic sector is identical with that of the nonlinear  model ec3 on the su (2) 4

lattice denoted by o(n)o(n) there in the case n = 4 is isomorphic to eb as
c2 = c3 and (e2)4 = ec1 = ec2 = ec3 of the moduli spaces found so far is best
understood by observing that ec1 = (e2)4 can be constructed from c1 = (b2)4 by
modding out z2 = h[2, 0, 2, 0]i  gab
terms of the charge lattice b of c1 = (b2)4 as described in [g-p], this amounts to
a shift orbifold by the vector  = 1
2 (1, 1, 0, 0; 1,1, 0, 0) on b. indeed, this shift
simply reverts the shift we used to explain remark 3.4 and brings us back onto
. but as for c1 = c2 and c3, ec1 = ec2 and ec3 will correspond
the torus tsu(2) 4
to dierent compactications of the type iia string.
from (3.15) we are able to determine the geometric counterpart of [2, 0, 2, 0]
on k(z4, 0): it is the unique nontrivial central element t1111 of the algebraic
automorphism group g+
kummer depicted in gure 3.1. hence the commutant of

dened in (3.19). the relation between the two meeting points (2)4 = c1 =

kummer, but it is not clear so far how to continue the residual

els (b2)4 and (e2)4. thus we identify j =(cid:0)0

t1111 is the entire g+
kummer/z2 algebraically to the twisted sectors in (e2)4 with respect to the t1111
g+
orbifold.
we remark that conformal eld theory also helps us to draw conclusions on the
geometry of the kummer surfaces under inspection: k( 12
d4, b) is obtained
from k(z4, 0) by modding out the classical symmetry t1111, so in terms of the
decomposition (1.4) we stay in the same chart of mk3, i.e. choose the same
nullvector  for both theories. this means that we can explicitly relate the
respective geometric data. for both kummer surfaces we choose the complex
structures induced by the n = (2, 2) algebra in the corresponding gepner mod-
in both theories with
the twoforms (dz1dz2), (dz1dz2) dening the complex structure of k().
here  : t  k() is the rational map of degree two,  = z4 or  = 12
d4, re-
spectively. then both k() are singular k3 surfaces (see section 2.5). given the
lattices of the underlying tori one can compute the intersection form for real and
imaginary part of the above twoforms dening the complex structure. one nds
that they span sublattices of the transcendental lattices with forms diag(4, 4)
for k(z4) and diag(8, 8) for k( 12
d4), respectively. the factor of two dierence
was to be expected, because t1111 has degree two. nevertheless, one may check
that the transcendental lattices themselves for both surfaces have quadratic form
diag(4, 4). note that for a given algebraic automorphism in general it is hard to
decide how the transcendental lattices transform under modding out [in, cor.
1.3.3]. in our case, we could read it o thanks to the gepner type descriptions
of our conformal eld theories.

proof:
the proof works analogously to that of theorem 3.5. from theorem 2.8 it follows
that the z4 orbifold of t ( 12

ec2 = k( 12
d4, b) by modding out the automorphism r12 as depicted in gure
2.1. thus we should work with the models ec1 = (e2)4 and ec2 = k( 12
d4, b)
which are isomorphic by theorem 3.7. we use the notations introduced there.
then r12 is induced by e1 7 e2, e2 7 e1, e3 7 e4, e4 7 e3. of the su(2) 6
current algebra of ec2 we nd a surviving su(2) 2
1 u(1)4 current algebra on the z4
orbifold generated by j, j, a; p, p , q, r, s (see equations (2.2) and (3.18)).
the action on the generators ej , f j ; j  {p, q, r, s} is already diagonalized.
all the ej are invariant as well as f p . on the fermionic part of the space of
states of ec2 the identications (3.11) hold. the elds w j
1,1 , i 
{1} are those invariant under the z4 action. our eld by eld identications
of theorem 3.7 now allow us to read o the induced action on the gepner type
model ec1 = (e2)4. one checks that it agrees with the symmetry [2, 2, 0, 0] dened
in (3.12) which revokes the orbifold by the z2 action of [2, 2, 0, 0]. because ec1 =
(e2)4 was constructed from the gepner model (2)4 by modding out z2  z2 =
h[2, 2, 0, 0], [2, 0, 2, 0]i  galg

agrees with the gepner type model obtained from (2)4 by modding out z2 =
h[2, 0, 2, 0]i. this clearly is isomorphic to (b2)4 by a permutation of the minimal

ab , it follows that the z4 orbifold of t ( 12

1,2 and w a

model factors.



4. conclusions: a panoramic picture of the moduli space

we conclude by joining the information we gathered so far to a panoramic picture
of those strata of the moduli space we have fully under control now (gure 4.1).

fig. 4.1. strata of the moduli space.

the rest of this section is devoted to a summary of what we have learned about
the various components depicted in gure 4.1. all the strata are dened as

a hikers guide to k3

quaternionic submanifolds of the moduli space mk3 consisting of theories which
admit certain restricted geometric interpretations. in other words, a suitable
choice of  as described in section 1 yields (, v, b) such that , b have the
respective properties. in the following we will always tacitly assume that an
appropriate choice of  has been performed already.
figure 4.1 contains two strata of real dimension 16, depicted as a horizontal plane
and a mexican hat like object, respectively. the horizontal plane is the kummer
stratum, the subspace of the moduli space consisting of all theories which admit
a geometric interpretation on a kummer surface x in the orbifold limit. in other
words, it is the 16 dimensional moduli space of all theories k(, bt ) obtained
from a nonlinear  model on a torus t = r4/ by applying the ordinary z2
orbifold procedure; the b-eld takes values b = 12
z , where bt 
h 2(t, r)  h 2(x, r) (see the explanation after theorem 2.1), and b(2)
z 
h even(x, z) as described in theorem 2.3. we have an embedding mtori  mk3
as quaternionic submanifold, and we know how to locate this stratum within
mk3. kummer surfaces in the orbifold limit have a generic group f4
2 of algebraic
automorphisms which leave the metric invariant. any conformal eld theory
associated to such a kummer surface possesses an su(2) 2
1 subalgebra (2.2) of
the holomorphic w-algebra.
the mexican hat like object in gure 4.1 depicts the moduli space (1.17) of
theories associated to tori. two meeting points with the kummer stratum have

bt + 1

2 b(2)

been determined so far, namely (b2)4 and (e2)4 (see remarks 3.4 and 3.8). we
found (b2)4 = k(z4, 0) = t (d4, 0) and (e2)4 = k( 12

d4, b) = t (z4, 0), where
b was dened in (3.16).
the vertical plane in gure 4.1 depicts a stratum of real dimension 8, namely
the moduli space of theories admitting a geometric interpretation as z4 orbifold
of a nonlinear  model on t = r4/. in order for the orbifold procedure to be
well dened we assume  to be generated by i = riz2, ri  r, i = 1, 2 (1
is not necessarily orthogonal to 2) and bt  h 2(t, r)z4  h 2(x, r) (see
lemma 2.9). the b-eld then takes values b = 1
as described in
theorem 2.11, where the embedding of this stratum in mk3 is also explained.
the generic group of algebraic automorphisms for z4 orbifolds is z2  f4
2. by
theorem 3.9 there is a meeting point with the kummer stratum in the z4 orbifold
of t ( 12
the four lines in gure 4.1 are strata of real dimension 4 which are dened by
restriction to theories admitting a geometric interpretation (, v, b) with xed
 and allowed b-eld values b  . thus the volume is the only geometric
parameter along the lines and we can associate a xed hyperkahler structure
on k3 to each of them. for all four lines it turns out that one can choose a
complex structure such that the respective k3 surface is singular. hence  can
be described by giving the quadratic form on the transcendental lattice and the
kahler class for this choice of complex structure. specically we have:

d4, b), where b is given by (3.16), which agrees with k(z4, 0) = (b2)4.

 quartic line: though well established in the context of landau-ginzburg
theories, this stratum has been somewhat conjectural up to now. we de-
scribe it as the moduli space of theories admitting a geometric interpretation
(q, vq, bq) on the fermat quartic (2.17) equipped with a kahler metric in
the class of the fubini-study metric, in order for q to be invariant under
the algebraic automorphism group g = z2

values bq  q, because (g) = 5 and therefore h 2(x, r)g = q.

in gure 4.1 we have two dierent shortdashed arrows indicating relations be-
tween lines. consider the kummer surface k(z4) associated to the z4-line. as
demonstrated in theorem 2.8, the group g+
kummer of algebraic automorphisms
of k(z4) which leave the metric invariant contains the automorphism r12 of
order two (see gure 2.1) which upon modding out produces the z4 orbifold-
line. the entire moduli space of z4 orbifold conformal eld theories is ob-
tained this way from z2 orbifold theories k(, bt ), where  is generated by
i = riz2, ri  r, i = 1, 2 and bt  h 2(t, r)z4.
modding out t1111  g+
kummer (see gure 3.1) on the z4-line produces the d4-
line, as argued at the end of section 3.5. note that the k3 surfaces associated
to z4- and d4-lines have the same quadratic form on their transcendental lat-
tices and hence are identical as algebraic varieties. still, the corresponding lines
in moduli space are dierent because dierent kahler classes are xed. in our
terminology this is expressed by the change of lattices of the underlying tori
on transition from one line to the other. the d4-line can also be viewed as the
image of the z4-line upon shift orbifold on the underlying torus.
finally, we list the zero dimensional strata shown in gure 4.1.
to construct k(d4, 0) on the d4-line, we may as well apply the ordinary z2

orbifold procedure to the d4-torus theory in the meeting point (b2)4 (the arrow

4 the quadratic form for the transcendental lattice of quartic and the z4 orbifold of t =

r4/z4 can be found in [in, shi].

with label  in gure 4.1). we stress that in contrast to what was conjectured
in [e-o-t-y] this is not a meeting point with the z4 orbifold-plane.
as demonstrated in theorem 3.5 and also conjectured in [e-o-t-y], gepners
model (2)4 is the point of enhanced symmetry  = z4, bt = 0 on the z4
orbifold-line. in section 3.1 we have studied the algebraic symmetry group of
(2)4 and in corollary 3.6 proved that it admits a geometric interpretation with
fermat quartic target space, too. in terms of the gepner model, the moduli of
innitesimal defomation along the z4 orbifold and the quartic line are real and
imaginary parts of v ,(,   {1}) as in (3.14) and of the (1, 1)-superpartners
of (1
the gepner type models (b2)4 and (e2)4 which are meeting points of torus and

k3 moduli spaces have been mentioned above. for all the longdash arrowed
correspondences (2)4

know the symmetries to be modded out from the gepner (type) model as well
as the corresponding algebraic automorphisms on the geometric interpretations.

a. minimal models and gepner models

the n = 2 minimal superconformal models form the discrete series (k), k  n
of unitary representations of the n = 2 superconformal algebra with central
charges c = 3k/(k + 2). for constructing the model (k) we may start from a zk
parafermion theory and add a free bosonic eld. more precisely, (k) is the coset
model

su (2)k  u (1)2
u (1)k+2,diag

.

(a.1)

the primary elds are denoted by l
m,s;m,s(z, z), where l  {0, . . . , k} is twice
the spin of the corresponding eld in the ane su (2)k and we have tacitly
specialized to the diagonal invariant by imposing l = l. the remaining quantum
numbers m, m  z2(k+2) and s, s  z4 label the representations of u (1)k+2,diag
and u (1)2 in the decomposition (a.1), respectively, and must obey l  m + s 
m + s (2). here, the elds with even (odd) s create states in the lefthanded
neveu-schwarz (ramond) sector, and analogously for s and the righthanded
sectors. moreover the identication

in the case k = 2 which we employ in this paper, the parafermion algebra is
nothing but the algebra satised by the majorana fermion  of the ising model.
by inspection of the charge lattice one may conrm that the minimal model (2)
can readily be constructed by tensoring the ising model with the one dimensional
free theory which describes a bosonic eld  compactied on a circle of radius
r = 2. the primary elds decompose as

by dividing by the dedekind eta function.
to construct a gepner model with central charge c = 3d/2, d  {2, 4, 6}, one rst
takes the (fermionic) tensor product of r minimal models r
i=1(ki) such that
i=1 3ki/(ki + 2) = 3d/2. the bosonic modes
acting on dierent theories commute and the fermionic modes anticommute.

the diagonal sums t, j, g of the elds which generate the n = 2 algebras of
the factor theories (ki) then comprise a total n = 2 superconformal algebra of
central charge c = 3d/2. denote by z the cyclic group generated by e2ij0 , then

the (n s +gn s)-sector, onto integer or half integer left and right charges in the
(r + er)-sector according to c being even or odd, and adding twisted sectors for

the sake of modular invariance. in particular, the so constructed model describes
an n = (2, 2) superconformal eld theory with central charge c = 3d/2 and (half)
integer charges. for d = 4 the gepner model is thus associated to a k3 surface
or a torus, as discussed in the introduction. we again decompose the partition
function as in (2.4) and nd

belonging to the operators of twofold
lefthanded spectral ow are nothing but the su (2)-currents j which extend
the n = 2 superconformal algebra to an n = 4 superconformal algebra, and
analogously for the righthanded algebra. moreover, to calculate zn s(, z;  , z)
instead of using the closed formula (a.10) one may proceed as follows: start
by multiplying the ns-parts of the partition functions of the minimal models
(ki), i = 1, . . . , r. keep only the z-invariant i.e. integrally charged part of this
function; let us denote the result by f (, z;  , z). add the bth twisted sectors,
b = 1, . . . , n, by performing a 2b-fold righthanded spectral ow, i.e. by adding

qdb2/4ydb/2f (, z;  , z + b ). this way calculations get extremely simple as soon
as the characters of the minimal models are written out in terms of classical
theta functions.

we further note that to accomplish gepners actual construction of a consistent
theory of superstrings in 10  d dimensions we would rstly have to take into
account 8  d additional free superelds representing at (10-d)-dimensional
minkowski space in light-cone gauge, secondly perform the gso projection onto
odd integer left and right charges and thirdly convert the resulting theory into
a heterotic one. however, at the stage described above we have constructed a
consistent conformal eld theory with central charge c = 3d/2 which for d = 4 is
associated to a k3 surface or a torus, so we may and will omit these last three
steps of gepners construction.
