abstract

counterterm actions are constructed along the adm formalism. it is shown

that the counterterm action can be intrinsically written in terms of intrinsic

boundary geometry. using the expression of counterterm action, we obtain a

general form of the counterterm action available for any d-dimensional spherical

boundary. in the description, we also derive arbitrary dimensional holographic

conformal anomaly. it is also shown that counterterm actions for af spaces
can be obtained from the ads description just as taking the limit of   .
an asymptotically at spacetime with non-spherical boundary is speculated.

in the example, additional counterterms to eliminate (leading) divergent terms

due to deviation of boundary from round sphere are imagined by observing

(4-dimensional) holographic anomaly proportional to 2r. argument of the

deceptive-like anomaly is given by comparing with the holographic description

of 5-dimensional kerr-ads spacetime.

1 introduction

there has been a typical problem to dene a gravitational action suering from

divergence in a non-compact space.

in spite that several prescriptions within the

concept of reference space have been suggested so far [1][2][3], those are awed by

the fact although the divergences could be eliminated by choosing an appropriate

reference space, it is impossible to embed a boundary with an arbitrary geometry.

another drawback of the reference space method is that dierent reference spaces are

needed for dierent boundary geometries, so that one cannot dene relative energies

in a consistent manner.

recently, a prominent prescription has been suggested [4] in the context of ads/cft

correspondence [5][6][7], which could be understood as a realization of the holographic

principle [8][9]. according to the correspondence, uv divergences of quantum eld

theory living on a boundary of ads space are derived from ir divergences of the

bulk theory (uv-ir connection [10]). so, the bulk action could be regularized by

adding local counterterms [6][11]. on asymptotic ads spaces, this approach gives an

elegant expression of counterterm action in the form of the expansion for ads radius

 [4][12][13][14]

in case of even dimensional boundary, however, one encounters a logarithmic di-

vergent term in evaluating the bulk action functional.

in order to obtain a nite

action if we take the counterterm action involving this log term, it would cause prob-

lematic results in calculating a boundary stress energy tensor [13]. even though the

logarithmic divergence embarrasses to obtain a nite regularized action, it provides a

remarkable consistency check of the ads/cft correspondence [6][11]. in other words,

because a conformal anomaly for d-dimensional conformal eld theory in coupling to

background gravity comes from logarithmic uv divergences [15], evaluation of the

conformal anomaly in this scheme becomes a nontrivial check of the ads/cft cor-

respondence. (for holographic conformal anomaly for the dilaton coupled conformal

eld theory, see ref.[16]).

the counterterm action of eq.(1) has been also constructed from the gauss-

codazzi equations through an iterative process [14].

in the ref.[14], counterterm

actions for asymptotically at (af) spaces have been also investigated. however, the

procedure adapted for ads spaces could not be simply generalized on af descrip-

tions because of mathematical diculty due to non-linearity of the gauss-codazzi

equations. taking an alternative approach, they obtained a counterterm action for
af spaces with sdn  rn boundary geometries

very recently, a dierent prescription to construct the counterterm action has been

suggested in ref.[17]. in the prescription, a length dimensional parameter analogue

to the radius of ads space was dened, so that the counterterm actions for asymptot-

ically at and ads spaces are consistently constructed in the expansion for the new

length parameter.

in this paper, we introduce another method to construct the counterterm actions

in (1) and (2). in this construction, we take the adm formalism and show that the

counterterm action can be intrinsically written by the terms of intrinsic boundary

geometry. using our new expression for counterterm action, we obtain a general form

of the counterterm action available for any d-dimensional spherical boundary. in the

description, we also derive arbitrary dimensional holographic conformal anomaly. it

is also shown that the counterterm action for af spaces can be obtained from the
ads description just as taking the limit of   .

on the other hand, a counterterm action for af space with nontrivial bound-

ary geometry is examined. our counter example is the d-dimensional generalization

of the kerr metric [18] setting the mass parameter to zero. it is the metric of an

af space in spheroidal coordinates. this example has been considered in ref.[14].

the authors have shown that for d > 6 the counterterm action in (2) based on round

sphere boundary does not eliminate all divergent terms. in ref.[17], it has been shown

that leading order of divergent terms due to deviation from round sphere could be

canceled by introducing an additional counterterm action whose a form is similar

with the counterterms of squared boundary curvature in eq.(1). here, we shall show

that the additional counterterms can be conjectured in somewhat interesting scheme

3

as well: our derivation of the counterterm action does not use the full einstein equa-

tions. instead only normal-normal projection equation, which is obtained by project-

ing the einstein equations on the boundary in normal directions, is used.

in case

of simple boundary geometry (round sphere), other equations, tangential-tangential

and tangential-normal projections, are not crucial, because they become trivial or

dummy on the procedure. however, in case of nontrivial boundary geometry, the full

einsteins equations must be used. our observation is that taking only the normal-

normal projection equation, we obtain additional divergent terms in boundary action

value (bav), which are logarithmic. thus, the conformal invariance of regularized

action (ra) would be broken by a conformal anomaly. however, we shall show that

for an example of d = 4 the anomaly is proportional to 2r. that is, additional

counterterms proportional to the squared boundary curvature can be added on the

counterterm action in (2) and the conformal invariance would be recovered. we also

briey discuss about these aspects comparing with ads descriptions.

our paper is organized as follows; in sect.2, counterterm action is constructed in

the adm formulation. examples for asymptotic ads spaces are considered in sect.3;

a counterterm action for asymptotic ads space with sd boundary is constructed.

in this example, arbitrary dimensional conformal anomaly is obtained.

in sect.4,

relationship between counterterm actions for asymptotic ads and at spaces is dis-

cussed. for an af space in spheroidal coordinates, the divergent terms are evaluated.

additional counterterms to eliminate divergent terms due to deviation form round

sphere are conjectured in observation of logarithmic divergence. we also give a brief

discussion about similarities of these aspects and ads descriptions in a holographic

sense. discussions and summary are contained in sect.5.

where gab is boundary metric and  is the trace of extrinsic curvature of d-dimensional
timelike boundary x dened by ab = g
anb.  denotes the covariant derivative
on (d + 1)-dimensional manifold x and n is an outward unit normal to the boundary

x. the boundary term in eq.(3), so called gibbons-hawking term, is required for

well dened variational principle.

our purpose is to add another proper surface integral to the action in (3), so

that the action becomes nite in the limit that the boundary is taken to innity.

according to the counterterm subtraction approach, the additional surface integral

must be written in terms of intrinsic boundary geometry. for the procedure, we take

the adm formulation as a guide line for construction of the counterterm action. as

it will be seen in the following, the adm formulation guarantees for the counterterm

action to be written in terms of intrinsic boundary geometry.

to rewrite the action (3) in a canonical form, we rst take a metric given by

gdxdx = n 2d2 + gabdxadxb,

(4)

where n 2 = n 2() and g = g(, xa). in this coordinate system, unit normal to the
boundary is given by n = n

. then, following the standard adm procedure,

canonical form of the action (3) becomes

s =zx
ab is the momentum density conjugate to gab and  denotes the

where ab = l/g

(6)

where r is d-dimensional scalar curvature of the boundary. the equation h = 0
generates reparametrization of space coordinate . in fact, this equation one of the

gauss-codazzi equations that is dened by projecting the einstein equations on the

boundary in normal directions.

using the constraint equation h = 0, the bav evaluated from the action (3) on

the boundary  = 0 is given by a simple form as

so, according to the counterterm subtraction approach, regularized action, sra, is

dened by

where the counterterm action s is given by

sra  s  s,

s = zx

ddxdiv (a(xa; 0))  zx

ddxg0 adiv(xa; 0),

(8)

(9)

where div means to pick divergent terms after -integration and g0 is the induced

metric on the boundary.

what a counterterm action is a coordinate invariant functional of intrinsic bound-

ary geometry is an important requirement in the counterterm subtraction method.

this is because it is the only way to eliminate divergence of a gravitational action with-

out disturbing the equations of motion or the symmetries [14]. in eq.(9), the coun-
terterm action (functional a(xa; 0)) is explicitly given in terms of intrinsic boundary

geometry. (the lapse function n can be absorbed in the space coordinate  by a

coordinate redenition.) in fact, the divergent terms in bav is originated from the

gibbons-hawking term, which is the surface integral of the extrinsic curvature, as

well as from the bulk part. in the procedure, the extrinsic curvature term is canceled

by a term extracted from the bulk part, and the divergent structure of the bav in

(7) is determined by the terms originated from bulk part that are expressed in terms

of the intrinsic boundary geometry.

on the other hand, it must be also noted that in the above procedure, we have

not used the full einsteins equations in obtaining the counterterm action, but only
the constraint equation, h = 0, has been used. in the following, we shall show that
in the case of simple boundary geometry (round sphere), others in gauss-codazzi

equations become trivial. moreover, in the case of nontrivial boundary geometry,

this scheme leads us to somewhat interesting observation.

it will be presented in

section 4.

3 ads space and holographic anomaly

the counterterm action for asymptotic ads spaces in (1) is useful for various bound-

ary geometries. however, evaluation of counterterm actions for higher dimensional

6

boundaries is not manageable for its mathematical diculty.

in the expression of

counterterm action given in (9), we consider a simple but important example, eu-

clidean ads space with sd boundary and obtain a general form of the counterterm

action available for any d-dimensional boundary.

the euclidean ads space with sd boundary is described by the line element

the functional a in eq.(7) for the metric (10) becomes

in odd d case. using a relation rabrab = r2/d, it can be shown that the counterterm

action in (14) is equivalent to the eq.(1). that is, the counterterm action in (1) can

be written by a polynomial in the boundary scalar curvature r terminated by the

terms given in (15) or (16) for ads spaces with sd boundary.

on the other hand, the counterterm action for even dimensional boundary in

(14) fails on eliminating all divergent terms appearing in the bav. instead, the ra

contains a logarithmic divergent term

(17)

it has been already understood in the context of the ads/cft correspondence [6][11];

the regularization of bav by introducing local counterterms may break conformal

invariance and ra is left with a logarithmic divergent term. according to this pre-

scription, considering a scale transformation r = r for an innitesimal constant
parameter , the holographic conformal anomaly, a, for which dual cft is coupled
to the background gravity with sd boundary is given by

a =

(18)

the conformal anomaly in arbitrary dimensions has been given in geometric descrip-

tion [19]. restricting the cft in background sd geometry, eq.(18) is an alternative

expression of the conformal anomaly in arbitrary dimensions.

for s2 boundary, the eq.(18) recovers well known result

ad=2 = 



16g

(19)

comparing the (1 + 1)-dimensional anomaly on a surface of radius , 1/(8g) =
c/(122), the central charge c becomes 3/(2g). from the eq.(18) for d = 4, we
nd that the conformal anomaly agrees with that of ref.[11]

(20)

the conformal anomaly for n = 4 super yang-mill theory on s4 is 3n 2/(824).
comparing with the anomaly on this boundary from the eq.(20), 3/(16g), we

obtain the expected result

n 2 =

3
2g

,

(21)

where n is the rank of the gauge group of the dual n = 4 supersymmetric d = 4
su(n) ym theory. at last, it can be seen that for six dimensional boundary, the

anomaly in (18) is equivalent to that given in [11]

(22)

in fact, since we are concerned about s6 boundary, the terms in third line including

derivatives vanish. on the other hand, eq.(22) can be veried by considering the

central charge of n coincident m5-branes in the large n limit. it has been shown

that the central charge is proportional to n 3 [20]. so, the anomaly on s6 boundary

with radius , 15/(64g), is proportional to n 3/(46). thus, we nd [5]

(23)

before ending of this section, it is useful on the next section to consider another

euclidean ads space with dierent boundary geometry, sd1  s1,

ds2 =(cid:18)1 +

r2

2(cid:19) d 2 +(cid:18)1 +

r2

2(cid:19)1

dr2 + r2d2

d1 .

(24)

for the sd1  s1 boundary, the functional a in (7) becomes

2r

(d  1)(d  2)(cid:19) .

(25)

since all terms in expanding of eq.(25) are divergent for d > 2, the counterterm

action is just the negative of scl in (7) [14]

s =

8gzx

ddxg0(cid:18)d  1

 (cid:19)(cid:18)1 +

2r

(d  1)(d  2)(cid:19)1/2

.

(26)

it can be shown that using rabrab = r2/(d 1) and expanding for , the counterterm
action in (26) is equivalent to eq.(1). however, it must be noted that while the

counterterm action for sd boundary is given by a nite sum of the series in (1), for
sd1  s1 boundary it is given by an innite sum. as mentioned in ref.[14], in the
process the divergent factors 1/(d 4), 1/(d 6),    in (1) are canceled. thus, while
conformal invariance of the ra for sd boundary is broken by the anomaly in (18),
for the sd1  s1 boundary it is still conformal invariant.

4 af space and holographic anomaly

now, consider counterterm actions for asymptotic at spaces. in ref.[14], it has been

shown that the counterterm action for af spaces is not be able to obtain on taking a
limit of    in the procedure adapted for ads spaces, an iteration process using
the gauss-codazzi equations, because of mathematical diculty. however, in our
procedure, those are simply obtained by taking the    limit on the functional
as

in (25). in eqs.(27) and (28), the counterterm actions were written in the lorentzian

signature. given in ref.[14], the counterterm actions in (27) and (28) can be written

by

s =

(29)

in fact, the expression of counterterm action for af spaces in (29) is more general
than those in (27) and (28). because it is available for the af spaces with sdn  rn

up to now, we have considered counterterm actions for manifolds with simple

boundary geometry (round sphere). now, we speculate divergences of bav due to

deviation of boundary from the round sphere. in ref.[14], an af space in spheroidal

coordinates given by

where 2 = r2 + a2 cos2 ,  = r2  2mgr4d + a2, and m and a are the black hole
mass and the angular momentum per unit mass, respectively. it is important that

the metric in (33) does not describe the asymptotic spacetime of the kerr black hole

in (34). because, in the process, one is to meet a naked singularity. it is just the at

spacetime metric of n = 1 in eq.(30) written in spheroidal coordinates.

the functional a(xa; r0) for the metric (33) becomes

(38)

the appearance of logarithmic divergence in eq.(36) looks like strange. but, this

is an articial eect due to the fact that we have not used yet the remaining einsteins

equations that are normal-tangential and tangential-tangential projections. in fact,

rewriting the terms in the bracket of eq.(35) as

(d  1) +(cid:18)d  2  cos2  +
+(cid:18)(cos4   cos2 ) +

comparing with the calculation of ref.[14], some additional terms appear, r2

substituting the remaining equations into the action, those additional terms and the

logarithmic divergence would vanish.

however, this logarithmic divergence seems to tell us something more. follow-

ing the procedure taken in the ads descriptions, the logarithmic divergence breaks

conformal invariance of the ra within a conformal anomaly

as well known in the dual eld theory on curved boundary, the 4-dimensional anomaly

has an ambiguity that 2r term can be added to the anomaly with an undetermined

coecient. this corresponds to the choice of dierent schemes for regularizing the

eld theory. in our case, this comes under dierent choices for the counterterm action.

so, we can add additional counterterms given by

 s  r3

0zx

d4xg0(cid:0)ae + bcabcdc abcd + cr2(cid:1) ,

where e is the euler invariant e = rabcdrabcd  4rabrab + r2 and c abcd is the weyl
tensor. taking the coecients as b = a, c = 0, then the additional counterterms
become

d4xg0(cid:18)rabrab

r2(cid:19) .

the additional counterterm action in (44) is just that observed by solodukhin in

ref.[17]; those counterterms cancel the divergent terms which are caused by devia-

tion of boundary from round sphere. it should be also noted that in spite that the

counterterm actions in eqs.(28) and (29) based on round sphere boundary exactly

cancel divergent terms of the gravitational action for d < 6, the additional countert-

erm action in (44) is not proportional to the cubed boundary curvature r3

0rx r3
0rx r2. this is because the rst correction (i.e., small deviation from round

but r3
sphere) identically vanishes [17], i.e., leading terms of rabrab and r2 are canceled

each other in the brace of eq.(44).

5 summary and discussions

the counterterm subtracting method to dene a nite gravitational action on non-

compact spacetime has been speculated.

it has been shown that using the adm

13

formalism, the counterterm action could be explicitly written in terms of the intrinsic

boundary geometry. on the other hand, using the form of counterterm action, we

have obtained an expression of counterterm action available for arbitrary dimensional

ads spaces with sd boundary geometry. moreover, from this expression the arbitrary

dimensional conformal anomaly has been driven. our additional observation is that
the counterterm action for af spaces can be obtained as taking the limit of   
in the procedure adapted for ads spaces.

another interesting observation in the description for counterterm action devel-

oped in this paper has been given in the example of af space with nontrivial boundary

geometry. it has been shown that the additional counterterms to eliminate (leading)

divergent terms due to deviation of boundary from round sphere, which was suggested

by solodukhin [17], can be imagined from appearance of logarithmic divergence in

bav and perspective of the corresponding anomaly proportional to 2r.

it seems

that it is due to a deceptive procedure as skipping over tangential-tangential and

tangential-normal projections of einsteins equations in calculation of bav. in fact,

simply using the full einsteins equations, then we would obtain a bav without

the logarithmic divergent term. however, it appears that there is something in the

holographic sense. for the 5-dimensional kerr-ads spacetime with the boundary of

4-dimensional rotating einstein universe, the trace of stress tensor does not vanish,

but the evaluated bav does not contain a corresponding logarithmic divergence [21].

as mentioned in the ref.[21], the corresponding logarithmic divergence of the bav

should not be present for a spacetime which can be written locally as a product. it

has been also observed that the conformal anomaly, which corresponds to the cft

anomaly, is also proportional to the 2r term.
in addition, it can be shown [22]
that taking the limit of    on the kerr-ads description, the conformal anomaly
becomes the eq.(42). these holographic similarities of the kerr spacetime with the

kerr-ads description will be studied in detail in ref.[22]. it is also expected that

this study will be of help to prescribe the problem of construction of the at-space

s-matrix which has been studied on the large radius limit in the ads/cft corre-

spondence and suered from non-local holographic mapping [23][24].
