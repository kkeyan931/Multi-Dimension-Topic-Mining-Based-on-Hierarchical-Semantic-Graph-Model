regularization of quantum eld theories introduces a mass scale which breaks axial rotational and
scaling invariances. we demonstrate from rst principles that axial torsion and torsion trace modes
have non-transverse vacuum polarization tensors, and become massive as a result. the underlying
reasons are similar to those responsible for the adler-bell-jackiw (abj) and scaling anomalies. since
these are the only torsion components that can couple minimally to spin 1
2 particles, the anomalous
generation of masses for these modes, naturally of the order of the regulator scale, may help to
explain why torsion and its associated eects, including cpt violation in chiral gravity, have so far
escaped detection. as a simpler manifestation of the reasons underpinning the abj anomaly than
triangle diagrams, the vacuum polarization demonstration is also pedagogically useful.

i. introduction and overview

torsion arises naturally in riemann-cartan spacetimes when the vierbein, ea, and spin connection, aab, are
assumed to be independent.1 there is no compelling physical reason which forces torsion to vanish identically.
however not all components of torsion interact naturally with matter. in minimal coupling schemes only spinors
couple to torsion, and even then only the axial and trace modes of torsion couple to spin 1
2 particles. actually, in a
hermitian theory, only the axial torsion mode, a, interacts minimally with spin 1
2 matter.

investigations have nevertheless uncovered that torsion can have quite interesting quantum eld theoretic eects.
recent works have revealed that even the well-studied adler-bell-jackiw (abj) anomaly [1] receives further contri-
butions from torsional invariants [24]. moreover, because of the axial vector coupling, vacuum polarization diagrams
with two external axial torsion vertices are not transverse, with the divergence being controlled by the nieh-yan term
[5]. this breakdown in transversality occurs in addition to that manifested by the abj triangle diagrams that give
rise to a term quadratic in the curvatures.

a striking consequence of non-transversality in the polarization tensor is the generation of mass. we may think of the
axial torsion mode as an axial torsion photon [4], coupled to a current whose conservation has been compromised
because of anomaly considerations. the associated gauge invariance, the 5 rotational symmetry, is therefore
broken, and a mass results. in this paper, we describe explicitly how this phenomenon takes place.

it should be noted that the breakdown in current conservation poses no consistency problems. the reason is that the
axial torsion modes are not gauge eld modes, and are not responsible for any local symmetries. as shown in appendix
a, the axial torsion eld is itself a combination of vierbein and spin connections and transforms covariantly under
lorentz and dieomorphism transformations. the presence of a mass term therefore does not jeopardize consistency
of the quantum eld theory. the computations to be described below are carried out using a regularization that
preserves local lorentz and dieomorphism symmetries, and the internal symmetries of the standard model, so all
these invariances and their associated green functions satisfy the usual ward identities.

this paper will also examine one characteristic aspect of the standard model and its implications in gravity. the
standard model incorporates maximal parity and charge conjugation non-conservation by assigning left- and right-
handed fermions to dierent representations of the internal gauge group. in 4d, it is always possible to re-write a

1in appendix a, notations and denitions are claried, and a few relevant identities are briey introduced.

right-handed fermion as a left-handed eld with conjugate properties. in this respect, therefore, the standard model
can be dened using only fermion elds of one chirality.

in the presence of gravity, elds of one chirality are coupled to one set of spin connections, and those of the opposite
chirality are coupled to their conjugates. in appendix a, we show that the result in using only left-handed fermion
elds is a minimal coupling to the axial torsion and torsion trace elds via the combination j c  j (ib + a).
here j is the total singlet current over all left-handed fermion elds, a = 4ea, the axial torsion eld, while b
is the trace of the torsion eld. the rst term in c is anti-hermitian relative to the second, and hermitizing the
action would eliminate it completely. but doing so requires bringing in right-handed conjugate weyl elds, which in
turn are coupled to the self-dual or right-handed spin connection elds. these elds are distinct components of the
spin connection, and it has already been shown in ref. [6] that general relativity eld equations can be reproduced
without reference to them. they are therefore irrelevant in determining the equations of motion. the system can be
dened by an action that is dependent upon only elds of one chirality, thereby extending this characteristic feature
of the standard model to cover gravity interactions as well [7,8]. in this scheme of things, the appearance of ib is
entirely natural.

such an action preserves holomorphy in the chiral elds. in the regularization scheme adopted in this paper [9],
this property is maintained, and both torsional modes must therefore have the same mass. the generation of mass for
the b eld is not self-evident, since it has a vector coupling to the fermion elds rather than an axial vector coupling.
based upon our experience with qed, we might have argued that the associated quanta remain massless. the
dierence arises because of the anti-hermitian coupling. the operator appearing in the regularized integrals involves
the positive denite form in euclidean space id/ (id/ ). now (id/ ) diers from id/ , because of the anti-hermitian
nature of the coupling. for conventional internal gauge elds, the two forms of the covariant derivatives are the same,
and lead to hermitian dirac operators. we detail in section ii how this dierence causes the vacuum polarization
tensor for b to be dierent from the usual result for gauge theories and how b acquires an anomalously generated
mass. the coecient is equal to a similar piece involving the axial torsion eld.

we begin our discussion by showing explicitly below how the axial torsion eld can acquire a mass as a result of the
considerations outlined above, utilizing two methods of computation. next, in section ii, we generalize the discussion
to cover the completely chiral action in a general curved spacetime manifold with torsion. we show how both the axial
and trace torsion components must acquire masses at the same time through the covariant combination c = ib+a.
we end in section iii with further remarks on the distinction between gauged and ungauged symmetries, lorentz
invariance and abelian couplings, and also cpt violation in chiral gravity. appendix a contains a summary of the
notations used in the paper. appendix b contains details on the computation of the polarization tensor for internal
gauge elds within the completely chiral context employed in the paper. the results are not new [10,11]; without
spontaneous symmetry breaking, the tensors are all purely transverse. we have included the details for a number of
reasons. first, this invariant regularization diers from conventional schemes in utilizing an innite tower of massive
pauli-villars regulators. this is necessary for weyl fermions when the gauge coupling representation t a is complex,
as it is in the standard model. second, the doubling in the regulators typical of this method is done in internal
t a gauge space rather than by including both left- and right- handed chiral fermions. this dierence is not really
signicant for the vacuum polarization of internal gauge elds in at spacetime, but for gravitational elds doubling
in the internal space allows us to avoid the introduction of right-handed fermions and right-handed spin connections
and thereby preserve the chirality of the gravitational interaction even at the level of regularization. thus even in
teleparallel spacetimes with at vierbein, the chirality of the torsion coupling of weyl fermions to c = ib + a will
be ensured at the quantum eld theoretic level. appendix b also supplies the check that computations with doubling
in internal gauge space can be carried out consistently. finally, and more importantly, the explicit intermediate steps
allow us to compare and contrast with the results of the polarization of the torsion modes in section ii.

had this expression been well dened, it would have been no more than

(1.3)

(1.4)

(1.5)

since the two 5s cancel out in the trace, and we would have obtained the usual vacuum polarization amplitude for
which we do not expect a longitudinal component. but it is not, for the integration over fermion loop momentum
diverges. we will need a regularization scheme, pauli-villars for instance, to tame this divergence before performing
any dirac algebra. any gauge-invariant scheme however will compromise symmetry generated by the axial current;
this is the essence of the abj anomaly. for example, in the scheme to be used in this paper, the regulator elds carry
masses {mn}. summing over the propagators for all the elds, including the massive regulators, results in

 (k)  xn

cnz d4p tr{5

1

(p/ + k/ ) + imn

1

p/ + imn},

(1.6)

with cn = 1, depending on whether the regulators are anticommuting or commuting. (for the original fermion
multiplet, c0 = 1 and m0 = 0. we assume analytic continuation to euclidean green functions.) by moving the
second 5 to the left to cancel out the rst, and bearing in mind that 5 anticommutes with the dirac matrices, we
observe that mn changes its relative sign with respect to (p/ + k/ ) in the denominator. consequently,

 (k)  xn

cnz d4p tr{

(p/ + k/ )  imn



1

p/ + imn}.

(1.7)

the integrals over the loop momentum will be well dened for a suitable set {cn, mn} which satises the pauli-villars
conditions. in section ii an explicit set of {cn, mn} shall be presented for the weyl theory. it is also applicable to the
bispinor theory here, consistently yielding a polarization magnitude which is twice that of the single weyl fermion.
the important point is that if we had started with a vector (instead of the axial vector) coupling, the result for eq.
(1.7) would have been

 (k)  xn

cnz d4p tr{

1

(p/ + k/ ) + imn



1

p/ + imn}

(1.8)

instead. this integral would have produced a transverse polarization tensor. as it is, by rewriting one of the
propagators in eq. (1.7) as

1

(p/ + k/ )  imn

=

1

(p/ + k/ ) + imn 

2imn

(p + k)2 + m2
n

.

(1.9)

we obtain two terms, the rst of which is identical to the integral in eq. (1.8). however, there is now an additional
anomalous term which is given by

cnz d4p tr{

.

(1.10)

this non-transverse part of the vacuum polarization tensor, above and beyond the usual transverse (kk 
gk2)(k2) term from eq. (1.8), is clearly generated anomalously through massive regulators which break the
5 symmetry of the classical action. both the axial vector coupling and the presence of nontrvial mns from the
regularization are required for the argument to go through. from

3

and the divergence of eq. (1.3), we deduce that

 = (kk  g k2) + g

k  k

and hj 5ireg   a 6= 0

(1.11)

(1.12)

at the level of vacuum polarization diagrams. the anomalous g contribution in the vacuum polarization tensor
also implies that besides the usual f f  piece required for the transverse polarization, a mass counter term of the
form aa is also needed for the non-zero longitudinal component in the eective action. a becomes massive as a
result.

in vector qed, curbing divergences by naive momentum truncation also results in a non-transverse photon polariza-
tion tensor [12]. but this apparent breakdown of gauge invariance is an artifact of symmetry breaking regularization
which can be removed altogether by proper gauge-invariant regularization schemes. one may therefore suspect that,
in the axial-vector coupling of torsion to fermions, the non-transverse polarization exhibited here is likewise the con-
sequence of a fake anomaly resulting from improper regularization which breaks the symmetry of axial rotations.
that this is not the case is guaranteed by the abj anomaly. the anomaly assures us that there are no regulariza-
tion schemes that preserve singlet axial rotations, and at the same time respect all of the local symmetries, such as
lorentz and other gauge symmetries, which are present. the non-transverse polarization for axial torsion can thus
be regarded as another manifestation of this phenomenon. as discussed in appendix a, a transforms covariantly
under dieomorphisms, and is lorentz invariant. the counter term necessary to compensate for a non-transverse
polarization tensor, aa, is therefore completely consistent with local lorentz and dieomorphism invariance. a
similar term in qed would have violated local gauge invariance.

before leaving this topic, it is instructive to exhibit and conrm the same eect using an alternative regularization

method. for bispinors, we may write the eective action in curved space as

e. = itr ln[e

i/ = (i +

2 i/ e 1

2 ],

i

abab + a5).

(1.13)

with heat kernel regularization and the schwinger-dewitt expansion [13], the abj anomaly with euclidean signature
has been demonstrated to take the form [2]

(1.14)

furthermore, it is known that the traces of the coecients a0, a1 and a2 contribute to the divergent part of the eective
action. for instance, a0 = i leads to the renormalization of the cosmological constant. we focus on the relevant
coecient a1 which, in our notation, is a1 =  1
12 r  2aa  5e1(ea). clearly tr(ea1) (and thus the eective
action) contains both the familiar einstein-hilbert term, er, as well as the eaa axial torsion contribution which
we also found to be required by the vacuum polarization computations above. moreover, it follows from eq.(1.13)
that the abj anomaly is

hj 5ireg = 

2i

(4)2t

 a +

2i
(4)2 tr(e5a2).

(1.15)

tr(e5a2) is the more familiar regulator scale independent part of the abj anomaly. but there is also the t-dependent
rst term (t has the physical dimension of inverse regulator mass squared). this is precisely the nieh-yan contribution
to the abj anomaly. the linear dependence on a shows that the vacuum polarization is indeed the correct feynman
diagram process to consider for this purpose [4]. therefore the non-transversality of the polarization tensor is not
only genuine, but is in fact necessary to understand the origin of the nieh-yan contribution to the abj anomaly in
perturbation theory.

ii. weyl fermions and vacuum polarization tensor of torsion fields

the classical weyl action for a left-handed fermion multiplet in a general curved spacetime is

4

sl = z d4x elid/ l,

(2.1)

2 aabab + wat a).

with id/ = (i + i
it is known that if the representation of the internal gauge eld t a
is perturbatively anomaly-free (tr(t a) = tr(t a{t b, t c}) = 0), then all fermionic loops in background gauge and
gravitational elds of the theory can be regularized in an explicitly gauge, lorentz and dieomorphism invariant
manner through an innite tower of pauli-villars regulators which are doubled in the internal space (see ref. [9] for
further details.) this generalizes the invariant scheme rst introduced by frolov and slavnov [14]. specically, to
form general invariant masses, the internal space is doubled from t a to

t a = (cid:18) (t a)
and the original fermion multiplet is projected as l = 1
3 = (cid:18) 1d

0

0

t a(cid:19) ;

2 (1  3)l, where
0 1d(cid:19) ,

and d is the number of weyl fermions in the l multiplet. written in full, the regularized action is

slreg = z d4xe[pr=0,2,...{lr id/ lr +

(2.2)

(2.3)

(2.4)

the sums are over all even natural numbers for the anticommuting and over all odd natural numbers for the commuting
elds. with the exception of the original undoubled and massless (m0 = 0) multiplet (written as l0  l), all
other anticommuting lr and commuting ls multiplets are generalized pauli-villars regulator elds, doubled in
internal space, and endowed with majorana masses, which we take for deniteness to satisfy mn = n. c4 is
the charge conjugation matrix in four dimensions, and in the covariant derivative all elds are now coupled to
wat a. we emphasize that because all the multiplets are left-handed, there are no couplings to the right-handed
spin connection which neither needs nor should be introduced for a truly weyl theory. the regularization therefore
preserves the chirality of the theory with respect to the gravitational interaction. it can be shown [9] the net eect
of the regularization is to replace the 1

to concentrate on the vacuum polarization of the torsion elds, we specialize to wa = 0, and at vierbein

ea = a but retain nontrivial torsion couplings. to wit, the weyl action reduces to

sl = z d4x[elil + clel],

again c is the only torsion combination that appears in the nal result. in the above expansion of the current it
is crucial to note the two displayed terms within square brackets has the same sign. this is to be contrasted with
the result for internal gauge current in eq. (b4) of appendix b in which a sign dierence occurs. thus this origin of
non-transverse torsion polarization for weyl theory is essentially the same as that for the bispinor theory of section
ia. by comparing the intermediate steps of eqs.(2.8)-(2.14) with those in appendix b, these dierences in the signs
with eq. (b4) can be traced precisely to the 5 which comes with a and the non-hermitian ib interaction in id/ .
the relevant feynman diagram processes for vacuum polarization can also be read o from the above expression of
the current. the rst term arises from nontrivial ll and ll propagators due to regulator majorana masses,
while the second term is associated with ll propagators. proceeding as in appendix b, we arrive at

the longitudinal part of the polarization therefore diverges as the square of the regulator mass scale.

in the eective propagator with vacuum polarization insertions, it is known that a non-trivial longitudinal polar-
ization causes a shift to a physically massive pole, even if the bare propagator is massless in the beginning (see, for
instance, ref. [12]). since  is the fourier transform of

familiar curvature squared counter term gg(c  c)(c  c) required by the logarithmic divergence
of the transverse part a

note that b comes with an i in the complex combination c because, unlike 5 rotations, the group parametrized by

tries, and the current j 
l coupled to c is not conserved. as shown, k  k at the vacuum polarization level. the

full weyl theory exhibits no inconsistencies because these invariances are really not gauged as local symmetries. the
theory is on the other hand dieomorphism, and local internal gauge and lorentz invariant, with internal symmetries
gauged by wa and local lorentz invariance by the full spin connection aab. in fact, c transforms covariantly
under general coordinate transformations, and is invariant under lorentz and gauge transformations. under global 5
transformations, ea and aab are inert; while ea  exp()ea but aab remains unchanged under global scaling.
hence c is invariant under both. these global transformations are however symmetries of the bare weyl action. as
a result j

level, but these equations are nevertheless anomalous at the quantum level. for the weyl theory, there is actually an

connecting the abj and conformal anomalies [8].

the upshot is that the coupling of c to an anomalous current poses no consistency problems in the quantum
theory. in particular, the presence of the mass term cc  is compatible with all local invariances in the action. its
green functions can and does satisfy modied ward identities with additional terms that imply non-transversality.
with regard to the abelian part of gauged internal symmetries, we still require tr(t a) to vanish for the regularization
to work in curved space [9].

the appearance of a mass term for c does have one important consequence. the combination c is complex, and
the counterterms of the lorentzian signature lagrangian required by the vacuum polarization diagrams are of the
form

egg(c  c)(c  c) = egg[(b  b)(b  b)
+2i(b  b)(a  a)

+(a   a)(a  a)],

and

egcc = eg(bb + 2iba + aa).

therefore the anti-hermitian cross terms are lorentz invariant, but cpt-odd. in a related work [8] it was pointed out
that a truly weyl theory which preserves the chirality of the gravitational interaction should violate cpt through
b eects because of the non-hermitian coupling; and that these signatures of chiral gravity [6] will already be
manifest at the level of quantum eld theory in curved spaces in weyl fermion loops processes with external chiral
gravitational elds. an example is precisely the vacuum polarization diagram with two complex left-handed spin
connection vertices. the at vierbein limit with nontrivial c evaluated here indeed conrms the presence of these
cpt-violating terms in the eective action.

in general, we may decompose the torsion as t = 2

3 a a + qa, where qa is
constrained by eaqa = aqa = 0. since qa does not couple to fermions, the spin connection in the
fermion coupling can be restricted to

as a result, the samuel-jacobson-smolin action [6] (which is the (anti)-self-dual part of the einstein-hilbert-palatini
3 cc ). modulo the total diver-
action),
gence term which is not reproduced by perturbation theory, the cc  counter term required by vacuum polarization
computations is of the same form as the samuel-jacobson-smolin action in the teleparallel limit.

phenomenological consequences of massive axial torsion modes have been discussed before [15].

in our present
context, we wish to pursue the extent to which chirality can be used as a dening characteristic of particle interactions,
including gravity. that context required us to use weyl spinors, and also the ashtekar formulation of gravity. a net
consequence is that both axial torsion as well as vector torsion trace are needed, but with a relative phase which ruins
cpt invariance because of the chiral nature of the elds. massive modes appear as consequences of the anomalous
non-conservation of the current to which these torsion modes are coupled. our results to some degree extend those of
ref. [15] to cover the case of torsion trace as well. at low energies compared to the torsion mass, the fermion-torsion
interaction produces a four-fermion coupling. present high energy experimental data on four-fermion vertices sets the
lower bound for torsion mass at above roughly 200gev [15].

the question of mass generation via anomalies has had a storied past. in the schwinger model in 2d, the physical
degree of freedom of the photon is equivalent to a free massive boson [16,17] since the interaction term can be
transformed away by an axial rotation. the mass of the boson stems from the abj anomaly, which gives rise to an
infra-red pole in the polarization tensor. the value of the mass is uniquely determined when the vacuum polarization
tensor is regularized to satisfy vector gauge invariance at the expense of axial vector current conservation. on the
other hand, the chiral schwinger model in 2d is anomalous albeit exactly solvable. the resultant photon mass, while
still nite, carries an ambiguity as the previous condition of gauge invariance is now absent.
it can be made to
vanish, while preserving the (v-a) form for the coupling, but we then lose unitarity [18]. this paper discusses the
corresponding chiral situation in 4d, but without loss of any local gauge invariance. by retaining explicitly all local
gauge symmetries and the holomorphic dependence on the left-handed spin connection in the regularization, we end
up with a vacuum polarization tensor that is non-transverse, and gives a mass to c = ib + a. these torsion modes
are massive because of abj and scaling anomalies, with generated masses naturally of the order of the regulator scale.
since these are the only modes that can couple to spin 1
2 fermions, large regulator masses, or high cut-o scales in the
context of eective eld theories, naturally explain why torsion and its associated eects, including cpt violations
from b couplings, have so far escaped detection.

for pure internal gauge elds in at spacetime we set a = b = 0 in the dirac operator to yield

id/ = (id/ ) = i/ + w/ at a.

the positive-denite operator which appears in the regulator function is

where 2 = . thus the current has the expansion

id/ (id/ ) = 2 + i/ w/ at a + w/ at ai/ + w/ at aw/ bt b

after integration over z. this agrees with result obtained previously in refs. [10] and [11] using the generalized pauli-
villars scheme with doubling in external left-right fermionic space (rather than the method here of doubling in the
internal t a space).

the vacuum polarization tensor for internal gauge elds is therefore still transverse, and internal gauge elds remain
massless. this is expected since the regularization explicitly respects the local internal symmetries gauged by wa.
