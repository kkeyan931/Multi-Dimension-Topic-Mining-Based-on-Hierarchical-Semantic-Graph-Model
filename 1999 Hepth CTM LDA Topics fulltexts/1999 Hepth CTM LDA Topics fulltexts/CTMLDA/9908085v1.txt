abstract

we give a self-contained discussion of recent progress in computing the non-
perturbative eects of small non-holomorphic soft supersymmetry breaking,
including a simple new derivation of these results based on an anomaly-
free gauged u(1)r background. we apply these results to n = 1 theories
with deformed moduli spaces and conformal xed points.
in an su(2)
theory with a deformed moduli space, we completely determine the vacuum
expectation values and induced soft masses. we then consider the most
general soft breaking of supersymmetry in n = 2 su(2) super-yangmills
theory. an n = 2 supereld spurion analysis is used to give an elementary
derivation of the relation between the modulus and the prepotential in
the eective theory. this analysis also allows us to determine the non-
perturbative eects of all soft terms except a non-holomorphic scalar mass,
away from the monopole points. we then use an n = 1 spurion analysis to
determine the eects of the most general soft breaking, and also analyze the
monopole points. we show that nave dimensional analysis works perfectly.
also, a soft mass for the scalar in this theory forces the theory into a free
coulomb phase.

1 introduction

in the last several years there has been signicant progress in understanding the low-
energy dynamics of strongly-coupled supersymmetric gauge theories [1, 2, 3]. most
of this progress has been limited to holomorphic quantities, which give a great deal
of interesting information if supersymmetry (susy) is exact.
in many cases, the
moduli space of vacua and the phase structure and massless excitations of the theory
can be exactly determined. a natural question to ask is whether these results can
be extended to the case of explicit breaking of susy. as a rst step, one can study
the case where susy is broken softly by mass parameters that are small compared
to the scale of strong dynamics in the gauge theory. in cases where the low-energy
eective eld theory is known in the susy limit, one can carry out an analog of chiral
perturbation theory for susy breaking.

the most general soft susy breaking can be parameterized by turning on higher
-dependent terms in the coupling constants viewed as supereld spurions [4]. for
example, if we write

l = z d4 zqev q +(cid:18)z d2 s tr(w w) + h.c.(cid:19) +   

with

s =

1

2g2 + 2 m
g2 ,

z = zh1  2 2m2i .

(1.1)

(1.2)

then m is a gaugino mass and m2 is a scalar mass. the eects of soft susy breaking
that can be parameterized by chiral superelds can be studied using holomorphy and
susy non-renormalization theorems [5, 6, 7]. however, when studying the non-
perturbative eects of soft susy breaking, non-holomorphic scalar masses cannot be
neglected compared to holomorphic soft terms such as gaugino masses. (for example,
in an asymptotically free theory, if scalar masses are smaller than gaugino masses at
a renormalization scale where the theory is weakly coupled, then the renormalization
group will generate a scalar mass comparable to the gaugino mass at the scale where
the theory becomes strongly coupled.) in supereld language, the problem is therefore
to determine how the supereld z in the fundamental theory couples to elds in the
low-energy theory. ref. [8] pointed out that one obtains nontrivial information by
viewing z as a gauge supereld. the point is that z contains a vector eld

z =    +  a +   

(1.3)

that couples to the noether current associated with a u(1) q number symmetry. as
is well-known, this means that the dependence on a at low energies are controlled

1

simply by charge conservation. susy relates this to the dependence on the soft mass,
and one obtains non-perturbative information about non-holomorphic susy breaking
at low energies.

to make this idea precise, one must deal with several technical complications.
first, one must understand the renormalization properties of the supereld couplings
[11, 12, 13]. second, u(1) gauge symmetries such as the one discussed above are
generally anomalous. this does not give rise to any inconsistency (the relevant gauge
elds are non-dynamical sources), but it does mean that the u(1) symmetry is bro-
ken explicitly, and this must be properly taken into account. these problems were
addressed in ref. [8] in a wilsonian language, and used to obtain results in several
theories of interest.

in the present paper, we extend the results of ref. [8] in several ways. first,
we give a self-contained review of the method of ref. [8] in terms of renormalized
couplings and supereld rg invariants. we also give a new derivation based on a
non-anomalous gauged u(1)r symmetry in a supergravity background. we apply
these results to several classes of n = 1 theories that were not treated in ref. [8],
namely those with deformed moduli spaces and conformal xed points. in the su(2)
theory with a deformed moduli space, we are able to determine the vacuum uniquely
for vanishing gaugino masses, and compute the soft masses of the composite elds for
arbitrary perturbations at the maximally symmetric point. in the conformal window
of susy qcd, we give a very simple derivation of the fact that soft masses scale to
zero as one approaches the xed point. this result was previously obtained in ref. [9]
by explicit calculation.

we then turn to n = 2 su(2) super yangmills theory. this was studied in
ref. [7] for a special subset of the possible soft susy breaking terms. we generalize
these results to include the non-perturbative eects of the most general possible soft
susy breaking. we rst perform a spurion analysis in terms of n = 2 superelds
that includes all soft breaking terms except a non-holomorphic scalar mass. this
analysis also leads to an elementary derivation of the relation between the modulus
and the eective prepotential that had previously been obtained using properties of
the seibergwitten solution. we then analyze the theory using the n = 1 techniques
discussed above. in this way, we are able to determine the exact potential on the
full moduli space for general soft susy breaking, including the potential near the
monopole points. the agreement between the two calculations serves as a nontrivial
check on our methods.

we nd a rich structure of phase transitions in this theory as a function of the
soft masses. for example, when fermion masses dominate, the vacuum is near the

2

monopole/dyon points and exhibits connement via monopole/dyon condensation;
when the scalar mass dominates, the vacuum is at the origin and the theory is in a
coulomb phase. we also show that nave dimensional analysis works perfectly for
all the quantities we compute, giving strong support for these methods in strongly
coupled susy theories.

2 non-perturbative non-holomporphic n = 1 soft susy breaking

in this section, we review the results of ref. [8] on the non-perturbative eects of
soft n = 1 susy breaking, including non-holomorphic scalar masses. our discussion
here uses renormalized couplings rather than the wilsonian language of ref. [8], but
all results are completely equivalent. we then apply this formalism to the case of
deformed moduli spaces. this case has not been considered before, so the results are
interesting in their own right. this case also has some important similarities with the
n = 2 super yangmills theory we will study in the following section.

2.1 rg invariant supereld spurions

consider a supersymmetric gauge theory dened in the ultraviolet by a renormalized
lagrangian at a scale  where the theory is weakly coupled. we consider here only
the case where the gauge group is simple and there are no superpotential terms. the
renormalized lagrangian in superspace is

l() = z d4 xr zr()

rev (r)

r +(cid:18)z d2 s() tr(w w) + h.c.(cid:19) .

(2.1)

the renormalized couplings zr() and s() can be promoted to superelds to all
orders in perturbation theory [13], and susy breaking can be included by non-zero
2 and 2 dependence in the couplings:

zr() = zr()h1  2br()  2b
162 + 2 ms()

1
s() 
2g2

s() =

i

.

g2
s()

r()  2 2(cid:16)m2

r()  |br()|2(cid:17)i ,

(2.2)

(2.3)

the quantity zr is a real supereld. its components are dened so that zr is the
usual wavefunction factor, br is a b-term. an elementary but important point is
that the 2 terms aect the equation of motion for the auxiliary elds, with the result
that the physical soft mass depends on the logarithm of the supereld zr:

m2
r = [ln zr]2 2.

(2.4)

3

the quantity s is chiral and runs only at one loop [14]. its components are dened
so that  is the vacuum angle, and at 1-loop level, gs is the gauge coupling and ms
is the gaugino mass. however, gs and ms dier from the conventionally-dened
renormalized gauge coupling g and gaugino mass m at two loops and beyond [14].
one manifestation of this is the fact that under the transformation

r 7 ear r,
zr() 7 e(ar+a

r)zr(),

(2.5)

where ar is a constant chiral supereld, the coupling s has an anomalous transfor-
mation

s() 7 s() xr

tr
82 ar.

(2.6)

here, tr denotes the index of the representation r.1 for ar pure imaginary, eq. (2.5)
is a u(1)      u(1) transformation with charges
qr(s) = +rs,

(2.7)

and eq. (2.6) is a manifestation of the chiral anomaly. for ar pure real, eq. (2.5) is a
rescaling of the elds under which physical quantities are invariant, and eq. (2.6) is a
manifestation of the konishi (eld rescaling) anomaly [15]. note that zr transforms
as a u(1) gauge supereld. the non-perturbative validity of these anomalous u(1)
symmetries is the crucial new ingredient introduced in ref. [8] to analyze the non-
perturbative eects of soft masses in the theory.

the couplings g and m are the lowest components of a real supereld

r() =

1

g2()

+ 2 m()

= s() + s() +

g2()
tg

+ h.c.! +   
82 ln r() xr

tr
82 lnzr() + o(r1).

(2.8)

r is invariant under the transformation eq. (2.5). one can choose a special nsvz
scheme in which all of the o(r1) and higher corrections vanish, but this will not be
important for our results. for a discussion of the supereld r (and in particular the
role of its 2 2 component) see ref. [13].

if this theory is asymptotically free, the strong dynamics occurs at a scale   
where the gauge coupling becomes large. the scale  must clearly be rg invariant.

1the index tr is normalized to 1

2 for fundamentals.

with the ingredients above, we see that we can form two rg-invariant scales:

s   exp(

162s()

b

) ,

r   exp(z r() dr

(r)) ,

where

b = 3tg xr

tr,

(r)  

dr
d

.

(2.9)

(2.10)

the rg invariant scale s is a chiral supereld, and transforms under eq. (2.5) as

s 7  yr

e2tr ar/b! s.

in other words, s is charged under the anomalous u(1):

qr(s) =

2tr
b

.

(2.11)

(2.12)

because s is chiral, it is the scale that appears in non-perturbatively generated
eective superpotentials. the transformation property eq. (2.11) is exactly what is
required to make the eective superpotential invariant under the anomalous u(1).
for example, in a theory with a simple gauge group and vanishing superpotential,
the anomaly-free symmetries constrain the dynamically-generated superpotential to
have the form [16]

we 

1

b/(ttg)

s

yr

2tr/(ttg)

r

,

(2.13)

where t = pr tr is the total matter index, and the factors of s have been inserted

by dimensional analysis. one can now check that the power of s is precisely what
is required in order for we to be invariant under the transformation eq. (2.5).

the rg-invariant scale r in eq. (2.9) is a real supereld dened by analytically
continuation into superspace. specically, for real r() eq. (2.9) denes a function
of r() (up to a multiplicative constant), and the continuation into superspace is
dened by evaluating this function for r() replaced by a real supereld. r is
invariant under the transformation eq. (2.5).

another important rg invariant is the quantity

zr  zr() exp(z r()

dr

r(r)

(r)) ,

(2.14)

5

where

r(r)  

d lnzr
d

.

(2.15)

zr can be thought of as the wavefunction factor for the eld r renormalized at the
rg-invariant supereld scale r. like r, the quantity zr is dened as a supereld
by analytic continuation. although zr is rg invariant, it is not physical by itself
because it transforms under eld rescalings like a gauge supereld (like zr()):

(2.16)
however, zr can appear in the eective lagrangian: its transformation property is just
what is required to write kinetic terms invariant under the transformation eq. (2.5).

zr 7 e(ar+a

r) zr.

following ref. [8], we can also dene the rg-invariant

i  

s yr

z 2tr /b

r

! s,

which is also invariant under the anomalous u(1)s. it is easily shown that

i = constant  2
r,

(2.17)

(2.18)

so this does not give an independent invariant.

when the theory includes explicit susy breaking, the rg invariants above have

the ellipses denote terms that are suppressed at weak coupling; they can be computed
exactly in the nsvz scheme, but this is not important for our results.

the quantities in eqs. (2.19)(2.22) are rg invariants by construction, and can
therefore be evaluated at any value of the renormalization scale . in an asymptoti-
cally free theory, they simplify if they are evaluated in the limit   :

(2.28)

we can make a eld redenition to set br0 = 0; since we are considering the case where
there is no superpotential, this has no further eect. we see that the susy breaking
components of the rg-invariant supereld spurions are simple combinations of the
bare coupling constants. this interpretation emerges very directly in the wilsonian
approach of ref. [8]. it is interesting and somewhat counterintuitive that the bare
scalar soft mass can be thought of as given by the wavefunction evaluated at the scale
 = r (appropriately continued into superspace).

a remark on anomaly-free generators is now in order. the wavefunctions zr in
eq. (2.1) can be thought of as gauge elds for the maximal abelian subgroup [u(1)]k
of the full avor group of the model. we can choose a basis of generators so that
only one of the u(1)s has an anomaly and the rest are anomaly-free. for a soft mass
proportional to an anomaly-free generator, the rg evolution of the soft masses is
simply determined by charge conservation. this implies that the mapping between
the uv and ir soft masses is obtained simply by matching quantum numbers of the
composite. for example, in susy qcd a soft term associated with baryon number
has the uv form m2
0. in the s-conning case nf = nc + 1, the low-
energy masses for baryons and mesons are simply m2
m = 0.
we now consider briey the extension of these results to theories with superpoten-
tials in the uv theory. in this case, the anomalous u(1) symmetries considered above
do not suce to determine the exact dependence on the soft masses because there
are additional invariants that can be formed using the superpotential couplings. for

q = m2
q

b = m2

0 and m2

= ncm2

7

example, suppose that the uv theory contains a yukawa coupling . in that case,
we can dene an additional rg invariant  corresponding to the running yukawa
coupling renormalized at the scale r. the quantity ||2 is neutral under all sym-
metries (including u(1)r), and therefore symmetries do not suce to determine how
this quantity appears in the eective kahler potential. we can of course use holomor-
phy and symmtries to determine the exact dependence of the eective superpotential
on the yukawa coupling. this can give nontrivial information in the case where the
running yukawa coupling is perturbative both at the scale r and at a uv scale 0
where the gauge coupling is also perturbative. (we cannot in general take 0  
because theories with yukawa couplings are strongly coupled in the ultraviolet.) in
that case, we can expand the rg invariants in powers of |(0)|2/(162), and nave
dimensional analysis [27, 28] tells us that the eective kahler potential is an expan-
sion in ||2/(162).2 if (0),   4, these eects are smaller than the tree-level
dependence on the yukawa coupling in the eective superpotential.

similar remarks apply to the case where the theory has a product gauge group,
with some matter elds charged under multiple group factors. if one of the gauge
couplings becomes strong at a scale where all the other gauge couplings are weak,
we can compute the eects of soft masses up to perturbative corrections using ideas
similar to those discussed above for yukawa couplings. we cannot treat the case
where several factors of the gauge group become strong at the same scale.3

there are special choices of soft masses for which the rg-invariant yukawa cou-
plings i or ratios of strong scales ra/rb have no  dependence. in this case the
ow of soft terms can be controlled as in our simple sqcd examples. the physical
interpretation of these special rg trajectories is is claried below using a gauged
u(1)r background.

2.2 deformed moduli space

in ref. [8], this formalism was applied to theories with conning and infrared free
dual descriptions. we now apply these results to soft breaking in theories with
deformed moduli spaces. we begin with su(2) susy qcd with 4 fundamentals qj,
j = 1, . . . , 4 (2 avors). in the susy limit, the moduli space can be parameterized

2since  diers from (0) by an rg factor of order 3(0) ln(0/r)/(162), there are large

logarithms in the expansion when expressed in terms of (0).

3it may be possible to make progress in theories with discrete symmetries that interchange the

gauge group factors.

by the holomorphic gauge-invariants (mesons)

m jk =

2
s

qjqk = m kj.

(2.29)

classically, these satisfy the constraint pf(m) = 0, but this is modied by quantum
eects to [2] (see also ref. [17])

pf(m) = 1.

(2.30)

the anomaly-free u(1)r charge of q vanishes and the anomalous u(1) charge of q
and  are the same, so the quantum constraint is consistent with all symmetries.
to simplify the analysis, we use the (lie algebra) isomorphism between su(4) and
so(6). in so(6) language, we write the mesons as ma, a = 1, . . . , 6 with constraint

mama = 1.

(2.31)

if the soft breaking masses are small compared to the dynamical scale  of the
theory, they will make a small perturbation on the susy moduli space. we therefore
write the most general so(6) invariant eective lagrangian written in terms of elds
m satisfying the constraint eq. (2.31). the only so(6) invariant combinations of m
are m 

ama and mama = 1 (by the quantum constraint), so we have

le = z d2d2  2

r k(m m) + derivative terms,

(2.32)

where m satises eq. (2.31). note that m m is completely neutral: it is invariant
under so(6), u(1)r, and the anomalous u(1), and is also dimensionless. to calculate
with this eective lagrangian, we must choose independent elds to parameterize m
so that the constraint eq. (2.31) is satised. expanding in these elds gives the terms
in the eective lagrangian in terms of derivatives of the function k. the function k
is completely unknown, except that it must give positive denite kinetic terms when
expanded about any point.

up to so(6) rotations the most general vev can be written as

hmi =

(2.33)

(1 + v2)1/2

iv
0
...
0









where  < v < + parameterizes the set of inequivalent vacua in the susy limit.
for v 6= 0, so(6) is broken to so(4), while at v = 0 the unbroken symmetry is
enhanced to so(5). we then write

m = hmi(1 + ) + ,

hmaia = 0.

note that hm mi = 1 + 2v2.

the vacuum energy as a function of v can be determined from the terms in the

the auxiliary components of , we obtain

(2.38)

where hki = k(1 + 2v2), etc. we do not know the function k explicitly, but we know
that k must be nonzero everywhere on the moduli space in order for the kinetic terms
to be positive in the susy limit. this is sucient to conclude that the enhanced
symmetry point v = 0 is a local minimum for any positive soft scalar mass ([2
r]2 2 <
0) and for any gaugino mass ([r]2

2).

in the absence of a gaugino mass only the rst term in eq. (2.38) survives, so that
the positivity of k is sucient to conclude that the global minimum is at v = 0. in
this case, the eective lagrangian is

le = z d2d2  2

r k(1)h

aa  1

2(aa + h.c.)i + o(4).

(2.39)

note that at this order the only dependence on the eective kahler potential is
through an overall factor, which cancels when we compute masses. the masses are

m2

re() = 0,

m2

im() = +2m2
0,

(2.40)

10

where m2
0 is a common bare soft mass term of the fundamental q elds. the elds
re() are massless because they are the nambugoldstone bosons of the global
symmetry breaking so(6)  so(5). (local so(6) excitations of the vev eq. (2.33)
correspond to the real components of .) the mass of the im() elds is a simple
multiple of the bare mass, and is positive if the bare mass is positive.

these techniques can be applied to other models with deformed moduli spaces,
but we cannot generally determine the scalar masses. consider for example the case
of su(n) gauge theory (n  3) with n avors of quarks qj, qk, j, k = 1, . . . , n.
in the susy limit, the moduli space is parameterized by the gauge invariants

the quantum constraint is

detm  b b = 1.

(2.41)

(2.42)

the most general eective lagrangian invariant under the u(n)  u(n) avor sym-
metry (which includes the anomalous u(1)) and the anomaly-free u(1)r symmetry
is

le = z d2d2  2

r k(b, b, b, b, m, m ) + derivative terms,

(2.43)

where m, b, and b satisfy the quantum constraint eq. (2.42). (the content of the
above equation is that r appears only as a multiplicative factor.)

suppose we are interested in the maximally symmetric point hbi = h bi = 0,

hmi = 1. we write

and the constraint tells us that

m = hmi + ,

tr() = b b  1

2 tr(2) + quadratic terms,

(2.44)

(2.45)

where  =   (tr )/n is the trace-free part of . no symmetry can forbid a term
in the eective kahler potential of the form

k  b b + h.c.

(2.46)

(a quick way to see this is that the combination b b appears in the quantum con-
straint.) the quantum constraint is solved by eq. (2.45), and so this term is quadratic
in terms of the independent elds. therefore, in the presence of soft masses, a term

11

of the form eq. (2.46) this term gives a b type mass for the baryon elds, and we
cannot determine the masses for these elds.

although it is of limited interest, we can determine the mass-squared for the
mesons in the maximally symmetric vacuum. the unbroken u(n) diagonal symme-
try means that the kahler potential has the form

k = k0ntr() + chtr(2) + h.c.i +   o .

(2.47)

the fact that there must be n 2  1 nambugoldstone bosons from the spontaneous
symmetry breaking of the global symmetry means that c =  1
2, and the soft masses
for the meson elds are determined. as in the su(2) case, we nd that the mass-
squared for the n 2  1 massive mesons is + 1

2m2

0.

3 anomaly-free gauged u(1)r

in this section we give a new derivation of the results of ref. [8] reviewed in the previ-
ous section that makes use of anomaly-free gauge symmetries. this gives additional
insight into why we are able to obtain exact results for non-holomorphic quantities.
we use these results to obtain a very simple derivation of the behavior of soft masses
in a theory with a conformal xed point.

the ideas are easiest to explain in the context of a n = 1 supergravity (sugra)
background with a gauged u(1)r. this can be formulated simply using the super-
conformal approach to sugra [19]. in the at limit, the tree-level lagrangian for a
gauge theory coupled to a sugra background can be written in superspace as [20]

l = z d4 (e 2

+z d2 s tr(w w) + h.c.

the chiral eld  is the conformal compensator, whose role in the full formalism is
to break the superconformal symmetry down to super-poincare symmetry. the 
dependence is completely determined by dilatation invariance and u(1)r invariance,
under which  has respectively weight +1 and charge 2/3. all other elds have van-
ishing weight and u(1)r charge.4 in this approach to sugra, the u(1)r symmetry
is part of the superconformal group, and is gauged (the gauge eld is the sugra
vector auxiliary eld). the eld vr is a gauge supereld for an ordinary u(1) gauge

4in fact, it is worth noting that we do not need sugra to determine the dependence of .

however, sugra makes the dependence of vr more clear.

group whose charge matrix we call r. the superconformal compensator is charged
under this u(1) with r =  2
3 . the vev of the conformal compensator  = 1 +   
therefore breaks u(1)  u(1)r down to the diagonal u(1) subgroup. this unbroken
group is an r symmetry, and the matter elds have charge r. (this is the justica-
tion for the somewhat abusive notation used above, where the charge of the ordinary
u(1) is denoted by r.) it is this u(1) symmetry that must be anomaly-free in order
for the dependence on vr to be xed simply by considerations of charge conservation.
as shown in ref. [18], the condition that a u(1)r symmetry with charges r must
be anomaly-free in order to dene a consistent deformation of the theory can also be
derived without referring to sugra.

we now consider the susy-breaking background

vr = 2 2dr,

 = 1 + 2f.

(3.2)

the eld dr gives rise to soft masses at tree level, but the dependence on f is more
subtle. note that if the lagrangian contains no dimensionful terms, then w (q)  q3
and the  dependence can be completely eliminated from the tree-level lagrangian by
a eld redenition q = q. however, regulating the theory necessarily introduces
mass parameters and therefore brings in additional  dependence at loop level [21, 22].
the coupling of  is completely determined by dilatation symmetry, so the loop eects
are correctly included by the replacement

where d is the dual gaugino and gd the dual gauge coupling. comparing to eqs. (3.8)
and (3.9), we obtain the relation between the uv and ir soft masses obtained in
ref. [8]. (the equations above are valid also in the s-conning case nf = nc + 1,
where the dual quarks are identied with the baryons.) of course, the physical
masses should be evaluated at a renormalization scale  equal to the physical mass.
d()/162, where gd() is
however, this will give corrections to the masses of order g2
the running coupling in the dual description. these corrections are small if the dual
description is weak.

the gauged non-anomalous u(1)r is also interesting for theories with yukawa
couplings or multiple gauge factors. here it can be used to dene some non-trivial, but
nonetheless integrable, soft term rg ow. indeed the duals of pure gauge theories
often involve yukawa couplings. the underlying u(1)r symmetry then makes it
more clear why in ref. [8] the soft term ow of the dual theory could also be followed
exactly.

we now consider susy qcd in the conformal window 3

2nc  nf  3nc. this
was considered in ref. [9], where the explicit rg equations of ref. [23] were used
to show that all soft masses scale to zero. in this approach, the origin of this result

14

is clouded in the computations; we believe that the supergravity approach gives a
signicant clarication.

first, it is obvious that when the theory approaches a scale invariant point the
dependence on the scale compensator  must drop out from the eective action. this
is manifest in eq. 3.5, since the contribution of f is proportional to (g2), which
vanishes at the xed point. second, if we choose r to be the same for all quark elds,
the contribution of dr is proportional to

which is the quantity that controls the vanishing of the nsvz beta function:

this result holds because the r charge chosen is identical with the u(1)r charge in
the superconformal algebra at the xed point, which satises do = 3

operator o with scaling dimension do. for example, the o 2-point function can be

in which the dependence on vr drops out.

(3.15)

these results give the scaling of the soft masses for  larger than the soft masses
themselves; below this scale, the soft masses are relevant perturbations and the physics
is no longer controlled by the xed point. the approach to the xed point g = g is
given by

g2() = g2

in a strongly-coupled theory, nave dimensional analysis tells us that   1. by
eqs. (3.4) and (3.5) we nd that the scaling of soft terms is mq()  f(/)/2
and m()  f(/). we see that, for   , mq  m, so the scalar masses

where we have assumed that the gaugino masses essentially freeze upon exiting the
xed point. for  > 2, this solution is not applicable. in that case, the scalar mass
is scaling to zero faster than  itself, and the physical soft masses vanish. this is
a logical possibility in strongly-coupled theories, but unfortunately we are unable to
compute  and so we cannot determine whether this occurs.5

we close this section with some remarks on the possible phenomenological ap-
plications of conformal theories. the fact that soft masses decrease as a non-trivial
power law in the infrared in stronlgly-coupled conformal theories raises the possibil-
ity that this could play a role in understanding the smallness of susy breaking in
our world. however, there are some very generic diculties with this idea. first,
as pointed out above, the gaugino masses are always smaller than the scalar masses
in such a scenario. second, the reduction of the scalar mass discussed above ap-
plies only to the component proportional to the anomaly-free u(1)r generator. all
avor breaking scalar masses associated to the anomaly-free generators of the a-
vor group (su(nf )  su(nf ) for sqcd) will not undergo the suppression discussed
above. since realistic supersymmetric theories require the squark masses to be ap-
proximatively avor-preserving, this will make the susy avor problem more severe.
however, strongly-coupled theories near their conformal xed points may play a role
in nature for other reasons, and it is important to know how the soft masses scale in
such theories.

4 n = 2 super yangmills

we now turn our attention to su(2) n = 2 super yangmills theory.

4.1 n = 2 spurion analysis

we rst consider the theory formulated in n = 2 superspace and perform a spurion
analysis by generalizing the couplings to n = 2 superelds. this analysis generalizes
the results of ref. [7] because we use more general n = 2 spurions. this is sucient
to parameterize all soft susy breaking except for a non-holomorphic soft mass for
the scalar eld. we work out the eects of this breaking on the low-energy potential
using n = 2 techniques and compare our results to those of ref. [7]. we also give an
elementary derivation of the relation between the modulus and the prepotential.

5the anomalous dimension  can be calculated in weakly coupled theories, such as the 1/nc
expansion around the banks-zaks xed point at 3nc  nf = nc in sqcd. there one nds  
2  1 [9]. the question seems to be open whether  > 2 in the middle of the conformal window.

the gauge multiplet can be described in n = 2 superspace (x, , ,

) by

a supereld a satisfying [25]

didja = di dj a,

2 = ).6 notice that by su(2)r covariance
where i, j are su(2)r indices (
di = ij(dj), where ij is the antisymmetric tensor. eq. (4.1) states that a is a
n = 2 chiral multiplet, while eq. (4.2) is a reality condition that denes an n = 2
vector multiplet. in this notation, the lagrangian is

a =  + i2w + 2h 1

4

where  and w are n = 1 chiral superelds that are functions of  and

y = x + i( +  ).

we now consider extending the gauge coupling to a n = 2 supereld:

l = z d2d2   tr(a2) + h.c.
this is n = 2 supersymmetric provided that  is chiral:

dj

 = 0.

ref. [7] also performed a n = 2 spurion analysis, but they imposed the additional
condition that  is a n = 2 vector multiplet.

the low-energy eective theory arising from the strong dynamics depends on 

through the rg-invariant scale

(4.8)

where we have used the beta function appropriate for su(2). (recall that n = 2
susy implies that the gauge coupling runs only at one loop.) note that this is an

n = 2 superspace. for a precise denition of a, see ref. [25].

written in terms of a u(1) gauge supereld a:

f (a, ) = 2g(a/).

these considerations lead directly to an elementary proof of the relation between
the modulus u  tr 2 and the prepotential. suppose we turn on a 2 2 component
of  as a source:

 =

1
2g2 + 2 2 d.

from the fundamental lagrangian, we see that

(4.11)

(4.12)

1pi

 d (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) d=0

= hui.

in the eective theory, we can evaluate the term linear in d in 1pi/ d by expanding
out the - and -dependent terms in :

dhui =

8i h2g(a/)i2 2

where ad  f /a. this immediately gives

(4.13)

(4.14)

previous derivations [10] of this result have relied on specic properties of the seiberg
witten solution. here we see that it follows from elementary spurion considerations.

we can also use this formalism to work out the eects of soft susy breaking in

the low-energy theory. if we write

 =

1

g2 h 1

2 + 2m + 2m + 2i md  2 2m2

(4.15)

then this gives rise to susy breaking terms in the fundamental lagrangian:

and where  and  are the fermion components of a. (because the kinetic terms are
multiplied by a factor of 1/g2, the mass parameters as dened here are the running
masses. in n = 2 there is no running beyond 1-loop, or, equivalently, the holomorphic
and 1pi coupling can be take to coincide, r = s + s. as a reection of that the
matrix m/g2 is rg invariant, and coincides with the bare parameter at  = 
dened in section 2.) we can now work out the eects of this soft susy breaking
in the low-energy theory directly from the seiberg-witten solution for g in (4.10) by
expanding out the - and -dependent terms in .

specically, the terms relevant for the potential for the eective theory are

a =  + 2f + 2f  + i d,

(4.18)

where  is the complex propagating scalar, and f , d are auxiliary elds. the reality
condition on a implies that d is real, relates the coecients of the 2 and 2 terms, and
implies the absence of a 2 2 component. the eective lagrangian including soft susy
breaking is then simply given by eq. (4.9), where we expand the - and  dependence
of both a and . after some straighforward algebra (and use of eq. (4.14)), we obtain

(4.19)

note that su(2)r is manifest. the results above are valid away from the monopole
points; we will postpone the discussion of the physics of this result to the next section,
where we consider the most general soft breaking terms.

before we leave the subject of n = 2 spurions, we comment on the relation
between our results and those of ref. [7]. in that paper the dilaton s = i is taken
b = 0, and m = m
to be a vector supereld. this corresponds to setting m2
with md pure imaginary, which gives t = 2. su(2)r invariance means that
the perturbation is to just one independent soft parameter t . from eq. (4.16) it is
manifest that for this choice of parameters the half-line tr 2 = tr() > 0 remains



19

at to all orders in perturbation theory. non-perturbative eects remove this atness
and the vacuum is picked out along this half-line at the monopole point u = 1 [7].
notice that if we had taken  rather that i to be vectorlike, the at direction would
have been along tr 2 =  tr() < 0, and the vacuum would be stabilized at the
dyon point u = 1. this explains the apparent asymmetry between the monopole
and dyon points in ref. [7].7

4.2 general spurion analysis

we now consider the most general soft breaking down to n = 0. in n = 1 superspace,
the action including the most general soft breaking terms can be written

l = z d2d2  z tr(ev ev ) +(cid:18)z d2 s tr(w w) + h.c.(cid:19)

+(cid:18)z d2 m tr(2) + h.c.(cid:19) ,

(4.20)

where z, s, and m are now regarded as superelds with -dependent components
parameterizing the susy breaking. because  transforms as an adjoint under the
gauge group, there is an additional allowed soft term of the form

z d2  tr(w) + h.c.,

(4.21)

which gives rise to a mixing mass between the gaugino and  fermion.8 however, the
theory has a su(2)r symmetry that is not manifest in the n = 1 formulation under
which the gaugino and  fermion form a doublet. we therefore choose the n = 1
direction to diagonalize the fermion mass matrix and eliminate the term eq. (4.21).
under su(2)r, the fermions  and  form a doublet

j =   

! ,

and the fermion masses form a triplet

(m0)jk =   m0

0 m0! .

0

(4.22)

(4.23)

the su(2)r invariance of our results will be a non-trival check of our formalism.

7in fact, under the z8 r-symmetry of the theory, we have u 7 u, (, ) 7 (ei/4, ei/4).
therefore the symmetry that exchanges monopole and dyon poins is m  im, (t, ) 7 (t,).
8this term also gives a term in the scalar potential proportional to tr([, ])+h.c. that vanishes

identically.

20

in the n = 2 susy limit, we have z  s + s, and therefore r  s + s,
r  |s|2. we now add the most general soft susy breaking terms: a scalar mass
2
m2
 for the scalar component of ; a b-type mass term b tr 2 + h.c.; and fermion
masses m and m, where  is the gaugino and  is the fermion component of . as
discussed above, these terms can be viewed as -dependent terms in the supereld
coupling constants. as might be expected, this technique is especially powerful in
theories with n = 2 susy. for example, using the gauged u(1)r or the results of
section 2, one nds

z() = zr() = z(cid:18)s() + s() 

1

42 ln z(cid:19)

(4.24)

where z is the rg invariant wave function of eq. (2.14). in the u(1)r approach one
has e2vr/3 = z. this gives a simple exact closed-form expression for the running
soft parameters.

the bare parameters m2

0 and m0 are dened as in section 2. moreover we dene

in the same spirit

m =

(4.25)

in a eld basis where [lnz]2 = 0.

as long as the soft susy breaking parameters are small in units of , they can
be treated as a perturbation on the strong dynamics. these lift the at directions
and give a potential on the moduli space of susy vacua that we will determine. the
moduli space can be parameterized by the chiral gauge-invariant operator

u 

1
2
s

tr(2).

(4.26)

note that s and  transform in the same way under the anomalous u(1), so u is
completely neutral: it is dimensionless, and uncharged under the anomaly-free u(1)r
symmetry

() 7 (ei),

v () 7 v (ei), m() 7 e2im(ei),

(4.27)

as well as the anomalous u(1) symmetry

 7 ea,

v 7 v, s 7 eas, m 7 e2am.

(4.28)

neutral variables similar to u are also present in the n = 1 theories with deformed
moduli spaces discussed in section 2.2. this is no accident, since the moduli space
is in a sense deformed in the seibergwitten solution, allowing the holomorphic
prepotential to be a nontrivial meromorphic function of u.

21

4.3 away from the monopole points

we begin by describing the theory away from the monopole/dyon points hui = 1.
as long as |hui(1)| > 1, the only light (compared to ) states in the theory are the
u(1) gauge multiplet and the modulus eld u. the most general eective lagrangian
compatible with n = 1 supersymmetry, holomorphy, and anomalous u(1) invariance
is

le = z d2d2  2
+(cid:18)z d2 2

2s(u)ww + h.c.(cid:19)

rk(u, u) +(cid:18)z d2 1
smu + h.c.(cid:19) + derivative terms,

(4.29)

where w is the u(1) gauge eld strength. note that all susy breaking is contained
in the spurions r and s, as follows purely from n = 1 reasoning.

the kahler function k cannot be determined from n = 1 considerations, but it is
completely xed by the seibergwitten solution in the n = 2 susy limit. it is crucial
for our results that the seibergwitten solution also determines the purely chiral (or
antichiral) part of the kahler potential. (recall that our inability to x such terms was
responsible for our inability to determine the vacuum in n = 1 theories with deformed
moduli space discussed previously.) these terms vanish in the susy limit, but they
contribute to the potential when susy is broken explicitly. in the susy limit, these
terms can be probed by promoting the n = 2 gauge coupling supereld to a dilaton
source, as done in ref. [7]. they are then xed by the modular invariance of the
seibergwitten solution in the presence of the dilaton, which ensures that if we travel
around a closed path in the moduli space we return to the same theory up to a duality
transformation. adding a chiral plus antichiral term to the eective superpotential
corresponds to modifying the n = 2 prepotential by f (a)  f (a) + const  a, but
this clearly breaks modular invariance.
(more direct physical arguments that the
linear terms in the prepotential are xed are also given in ref. [3].)

combining this with the expressions for the higher components of r given in
eqs. (2.24) and (2.26), we can compute the potential for the scalar component of u.

is the holomorphic scale in the n = 2 limit. one can check that the dependence
on the vacuum angle  and the fermion masses is the correct one dictated by the
chiral anomaly. the result above does not have manifest su(2)r symmetry because
the coecients of |m0|2 and |m0|2 are dierent. (note that m0m0 = det(m0) is
su(2)r invariant.) the potential is su(2)r invariant if and only if

this relation is in fact satised, as can be seen by dierentiating the relation eq. (4.14).

arguments.9 we have factored out powers of 42 = 162/b according to the expecta-
tions of nave dimensional analysis [27]. the overall factor of 1/(42) arises because
the potential is a 1-loop eect, while the factors of 42 in the denitions of m2
soft,j
are chosen so that these quantities are equal to soft parameters renormalized at the
scale  where the theory becomes strong: g2()  42. if nave dimensional analysis
is reliable, then the functions fj should all be order 1.

the functions f1, . . . , f4 are plotted in figs. 14. there are several interesting
points to note about the results. first, note that the functions f1, . . . , f4 are all of
order 1, as predicted by nave dimensional analysis. this is striking evidence for the
correctness of these ideas in the context of supersymmetric theories.

although the results we have derived are not justied near the monopole/dyon
points, the behavior near these points is interesting. note that m2
0 and im(0)
apparently drive the theory away from the monopole/dyon points, while t0 drives the
theory toward the monopole/dyon points. re(0) apparently gives a local minimum
at either the monopole or dyon points, depending on the sign. when we will consider
the theory near the monopole points, we will nd that these conclusions are in fact
correct.

finally, note that the results above predict a rich phase structure as the various
soft breaking terms are varied. to give only one example, it can be seen that there is
a rst-order phase transition between a coulomb and a conned phase as we increase
the ratio m2

0/t0.

we now consider the question of how close we can get to the monopole points
u = 1 before the results above break down. the reason that the eective theory
breaks down near the monopole points is that there are extra monopoles (or dyons)
with mass

mm  [hui  (1)].

(4.36)

the seibergwitten solution away from the monopole points gives the exact eec-
tive lagrangian (up to higher derivative terms) with the monopole integrated out.10
therefore, as long as mm  msoft, it is a good approximation to integrate out the

the n = 1 mass perturbation studied in ref. [3] simply corresponds to m2
terms vanishing.

10higher derivative terms aect the scalar potential at o(m3

soft), while the leading eects we

compute are order m2

soft. therefore, higher derivative terms are negligible for small msoft.

(4.37)

the corrections are suppressed by powers of msoft/mm for |hui  (1)| < 1, and are
of order msoft/ for |hui (1)| > 1. for msoft   this means that we can trust the
above results up to a small region |u  1| < msoft/. inside this region the monopole

vevs can be turned on and decrease the energy. however we will later show that
this eect is parametrically small and it does not signicantly alter the picture of
where the vacuum resides. we can therefore conclude that m2
b0 push the
vacuum away from the monopole points, while fermion masses m0 and m0 tend to
stabilize the monopole points.

4.4 near the monopole points

we now describe the eective theory near the monopole point hui = +1.11 as argued
in ref. [3], near hui = +1 the weakly-coupled light degrees of freedom are the modulus
eld u, the dual photon eld vd, and the monopole elds m, m . the eective
lagrangian is therefore

a term of the form [13]

z d2 w

(4.38)

(4.39)

is absent by charge conjugation. (a careful discussion of charge conjugation is given
below.) the monopole elds form a su(2)r doublet

mj =   m

i m ! .

(4.40)

note that m is in a doublet with m  (rather than m ) because the doublet must have
well-dened u(1) gauge charge. the factor of i is required by su(2)r: the coecient

11the point hui = 1 is related to this point by charge conjugation.

of the term  m adm is real, while the coecient of the terms  m m and  m m
are both imaginary.

the seibergwitten prepotential gives the exact eective kahler potential and
gauge coupling with the monopoles integrated out. since the eective theory eq. (4.38)
includes the monopole elds, we must integrate in the monopoles, i.e.
invert the
process of integrating out the monopoles. in a general theory this is not unique, but
in the present case we need the eective kahler potential and gauge coupling only in
the n = 2 limit, where the result of integrating out the monopoles is exhausted by a
1-loop calculation. we therefore have

sd() = s(sw)

(4.41)

where sw denotes the seibergwitten solution with the monopoles integrated out,
and c is a scheme-dependent constant. (the analytic corrections to sd and k are
related by n = 2 susy.) we will set c = 0 from now on. here  is a renormal-
ization scale that is required because the eective theory containing the monopoles
has marginal interactions, and hence logarithmic renormalization eects. as a consis-
tency check, we note that sd and the kahler metric (kd)uu derived from eq. (4.41)
are non-singular as u  1 (ad  0).

in order to determine zm in eq. (4.38), we must discuss the transformation of
the monopole elds under the anomalous u(1) transformation eq. (4.28). note that
the anomalous u(1) is broken both explicitly (by anomalies) and spontaneously (by
hui 6= 0). furthermore, the monopole elds are not in any sense simple functions of
uv elds, so we must proceed carefully. the most general transformation law allowed
by holomorphy, u(1) gauge invariance, and dimensional analysis is

m 7 f (a, u, mm/2

s)  m,

m 7 f (a, u, mm/2

s)  m ,

(4.42)

where a is the anomalous u(1) transformation parameter. the explicit (anomalous)
breaking of u(1)a is contained entirely in the fact that s is not invariant. the
monopole term in the superpotential is therefore u(1)a invariant, which gives

ff = ea.

(4.43)

(recall that ad  s, so ad has charge +1.) finally, charge conjugation (dened
below) exchanges m and m , and therefore implies f  f . we conclude that the

30

monopole and antimonopole transform linearly under the anomalous u(1) with the
same charge  1
[the details of the charge conjugation argument are as follows.
2.
dene c in the ultraviolet theory as

c : v 7 v t ,  7 +t .

(4.44)

this is a symmetry of the uv lagrangian, and the positive sign for  is chosen so
that hi 6= 0 does not break c. (in a manifestly n = 2 symmetric description, c
is therefore an r symmetry.) the coupling spurions z and s are clearly invariant
under c. when the su(2) gauge group breaks to u(1), the elds in the eective
theory transform as

c : v 7 v,

u 7 u,

(4.45)

where v is the u(1) gauge supereld. this is obvious far from the origin where the
theory is weakly coupled, and cannot change in the strong-coupling region because of
continuity. because the monopole elds have opposite charge under the dual u(1)
gauge group, they must transform as

(4.46)
under c, implying f  f . the negative sign is ruled out by the fact that f = +1
for the identity transformation a = 0.]

c : m   m

now that we know how the monopole elds transform under the anomalous u(1)
transformation eq. (4.28), we can x zm in eq. (4.38) as a function of the uv
couplings. zm does not run by n = 2 susy, so it must be an rg-invariant function
of z and . it cannot depend on  by dimensional analysis, and the anomalous
u(1) tells us

zm = c z 1/2



,

where c is a constant that is xed by the n = 2 limit:

zm|==0 = 1.

(4.47)

(4.48)

this result can also be obtained using the gauged non-anomalous u(1)r described
in section 3. one has r = 0 so that z = e2vr/3. on the other hand, by charge
symmetry and r-invariance of the low-energy theory, the monopole r charges are
rm = r m = 1. therefore zm = evr/3 consistent with eq. (4.47).

a simple but remarkable consequence of these results is that the monopole soft
mass does not run to all orders in perturbation theory in the low-energy theory. this

31

is a priori surprising because the theory has no unbroken susy and has marginal
interactions. the reason is simply that the wavefunction parameter of the monopoles
does not run in the n = 2 limit. the running of the soft masses is obtained by
analytically continuing the running in the susy limit into superspace [13], and is
therefore controlled by the susy limit.

is the potential with the monopole elds set to zero. the above form of the potential
allows us to easily understand the origin of the cusp singularities in figs. 2 and
3. these arise if we set m = m = 0 and evaluate the running coupling g2
d() at

32

a renormalization scale equal to the supersymmetric monopole mass of order |ad|.
since g2
d()  1/ ln  for   , this gives a logarithmic singularity as ad  0. this
singularity is smoothed out when we minimize the full potential because the monopole
masses do not go to zero as ad  0 in the presence of soft susy breaking. (the
quantum corrections to the eective potential are well approximated by evaluating
the running coupling g2

d at a renormalization scale of order the monopole vev.)

we now turn to the monopole vevs. assuming that m0  m

0 is nonzero and
all soft masses are of the same order, the monopole vevs are essentially determined
by minimizing the rst two terms as long as |u|2  |m0  m

0|/. this gives

note that this justies dropping the o(m 4) terms in the eective lagrangian eq. (4.38),
since they contribute to the vacuum energy at most m2

turbation m

close to the conning phase found in ref. [3].

softhmi4  m4

the monopole vevs induce a positive mass-squared for u of order |m

0  m0|.
this is larger than the o(m2
soft) contributions neglected in eq. (4.51), so this stabilizes
the modulus at u  msoft. therefore the modulus is near the monopole points, and
the approximations made above are consistent.

we now consider the eect of the monopole vevs on the vacuum energy. this
is important for determining whether there are rst order phase transitions between
the monopole points and other local minima on the moduli space. by the above
qualitative discussion, it is easy to conclude that the value of the potential at the
minimum near the monopole points is vnaive(u = 1) + o(m3
soft). to obtain this
result, note that the terms in the rst line of eq. (4.51) respect n = 1 susy, and
therefore almost cancel at the minimum. their contribution is therefore only o(m3
soft)
instead of o(m2

this result shows that the vacuum energy near the monopole points is well approx-
imated by the value at the cusp singularities in the nave potential given in figs. 14
that neglects the monopoles. therefore, we can use figs. 14 to decide if the vacuum
is in the monopole (or dyon) region.13 at these points there are always at least local

are short n = 2 multiplets. however, it is interesting to note that we do not need the power of
n = 2 susy to justify dropping these terms.

5 conclusions

we have considered the most general soft susy breaking of n = 1 and n = 2
theories, including non-holomorphic perturbations. using the method of ref. [8] we
are able to obtain exact results when the soft masses are small compared to the scale
of non-perturbative physics (msoft  ) because susy relates soft mass terms to
background gauge elds. we gave a new formulation of this correspondence in terms
of a non-anomalous gauged u(1)r symmetry in a supergravity background. we also
applied this formalism to several cases of interest: n = 1 theories deformed moduli
spaces and conformal xed points, and n = 2 super-yangmills.

our results show that in many cases, the theory for msoft   is in a dierent phase
than the msoft   limit. for example, in the n = 2 su(2) super-yangmills theory,
adding a small soft scalar mass drives the theory to a free coulomb phase, while we
believe that the msoft   theory is in a conning phase. this means that there
are necessarily phase transitions as a function of the soft masses at msoft  . for
example, this is important for non-perturbative studies of these models on the lattice,
where supersymmetry presumably has to be imposed by tuning lattice parameters.
clearly, the road to understanding the relationship between supersymmetric and non-
supersymmetric gauge theories remains a long one, but we hope that the steps taken
in this paper will prove useful.
