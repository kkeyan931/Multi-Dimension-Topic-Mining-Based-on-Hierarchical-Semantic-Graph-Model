lectures given at the spring workshop on superstring and related matters,

trieste, italy (march 1999).

abstract

in the rst part of these lectures we will review the main aspects of large
n qcd and the explicit results obtained from it. then, after a review of
the properties of n = 4 super yang-mills, type iib string theory and of ads
space, we briey discuss the maldacena conjecture. finally in the last part
of these lectures we will discuss the nite temperature case and we show how
hadronic quantities as the string tension, the mass gap and the topological
susceptibility can be computed in this approach.

1 introduction

gravity is described by the einsteins theory of general relativity, while the other
interactions are described by gauge eld theories. actually also the theory of gen-
eral relativity is a gauge theory corresponding to the gauging of the space-time
poincare group, while those that are usually called gauge theories correspond to
the gauging of an internal symmetry. but apart from the fact that they are both
gauge theories does it exist any deeper relation between them? do they imply each
other in a consistent quantum theory of gravity? in the framework of eld theory
there is no connection; they can both exist independently from each other, but any
eld theory involving gravity suers from the problem of non-renormalizability. in
the framework of string theory, instead, where quantum gravity makes sense, we
see not only that they naturally occur together in the same theory, but also that
any attempt for constructing a string theory without gravity has been until now

1

unsuccessful. this seems to suggest that the presence of both gravitational and
gauge interactions is perhaps unavoidable in a consistent string theory.

string theories originated from the attempt of describing the properties of strong
interactions through the construction of the dual resonance model. it became soon
clear, however, that this model in its consistent form, that later on was recognized to
correspond to the quantization of a relativistic string, contained all sort of massless
particles as gluons, gravitons and others except a massless pseudoscalar particle
corresponding to the pion that in the chiral limit is the only massless particle that
we expect in strong interactions.

actually a model describing  scattering in a rather satisfactory way was pro-
posed by lovelace and shapiro [1]. according to this model the three isospin
amplitudes for pion-pion scattering are given by:

a0 =

3
2

[a(s, t) + a(s, u)] 

1
2

a(t, u)

a1 = a(s, t)  a(s, u)

a2 = a(t, u)

;

s = 0 + s

(1.1)

(1.2)

where

a(s, t) = 

(1  s)(1  t)

(1  t  s)

s = (k1 + k2)2, t = (k1  k3)2 and u = (k1  k4)2 are the three mandelstam
variables that satisfy the relation: s + t + u = pi k2
. the amplitudes
in eq.(1.1) provide a model for  scattering with linearly rising regge trajectories
containing three parameters: the intercept of the  regge trajectory 0, the regge
slope  and . the rst two can be determined by imposing the adlers self-
consistency condition, that requires the vanishing of the amplitude when s = t =
u = m2
 and one of the pions is massless, and the fact that the regge trajectory
must give the spin of the  meson that is equal to 1 when s is equal to the mass
of the  meson m. these two conditions determine the regge trajectory to be:

i = 4m2

s =

1

2 "1 +



s  m2
  m2# = 0.48 + 0.885s
m2

(1.3)

having xed the parameters of the regge trajectory the model predicts the masses
and the couplings of the resonances that decay in  in terms of a unique parameter
. the values obtained are in reasonable agreement with the experiments. moreover
one can compute the  scattering lenghts:

a0 = 0.395

a2 = 0.103

(1.4)

and one nds that their ratio is within 10% of the current algebra ratio given by
a0/a2 = 7/2. the amplitude in eq.(1.2) has exactly the same form as the four
tachyon amplitude of the neveu-schwarz model with the only apparently minor
dierence that 0 = 1/2 (for m = 0) instead of 1 as in the neveu-schwarz model.

2

this dierence, however, implies that the critical dimension of this model is d = 4 
and not d = 10 as in the ns model. in conclusion this model seems to be a perfectly
reasonable model for describing low-energy  scattering. the problem is, however,
that nobody has been able to generalize it to the multipion scattering and to get a
string interpretation as instead one has done in the case of the known string models.
because of this and also because of the presence of some features in the string
model that are not shared by strong interactions as for instance the exponential
instead of the power decay of the hadronic cross-section at large transverse momen-
tum, it became clear in the middle of the seventies that string theories could not
provide a theory for strong interactions, that in the meantime were successfully de-
scribed in the framework of qcd, but could instead be used as a consistent way of
unifying all interactions in a theory containing also quantum gravity [2]. it turned
out in fact that all ve consistent string theories in ten dimensions all unify in a
way or another gravity with gauge theories. let us remind shortly how this comes
about.

the type i theory is a theory of open and closed string. open strings have
chan-paton gauge degrees of freedom located at the end points and, because of
them, an open string theory contains the usual gauge theories. on the other hand
a pure theory of open strings is not consistent by itself; non-planar loop corrections
generate closed strings and a closed string theory contains gravity. therefore in
the type i theory open strings require for consistency closed strings. this implies
that gravity, that is obtained in the zero slope limit (cl  0) of closed strings, is a
necessary consequence of gauge theories, that are obtained in the zero slope limit of
the open string theory (  0). remember that the two slopes are related through
the relation cl = /2.
the heterotic strings is instead a theory of only closed strings that contains,
however, both supergravity and gauge theories. but in this case gravity is the fun-
damental theory and gauge theories are obtained from it through a stringy kaluza-
klein mechanism. the remaining consistent theories in ten dimensions are the two
type ii theories that at the perturbative level contain only closed strings and no
gauge degrees of freedom. however, they also contain non-perturbative objects, the
d-branes that are characterized by the fact that open strings can end on them.
therefore through the d-branes open strings also appear in type ii theories and
with them we get also gauge theories.

in conclusion all string theories contain both gravity and gauge theories and
therefore those two kinds of interactions are intrinsically unied in string theories.
but, since all string theories contain gravity, it seems impossible to use a string
theory to describe strong interactions. in fact they are described by qcd that does
not contain gravity!!

on the other hand it is known since the middle of the seventies that, if we
consider a non-abelian gauge theory with gauge group su(n) and we take the t

this can be checked by computing the coupling of the spinless particle at the level s = 2

and seeing that it vanishes for d = 4.

hooft limit where the number of colours n  , while the product g2
y m n  
is kept xed [3], the gauge theory simplies because only planar diagrams survive
in this limit. in the large n limit the gauge invariant observables are determined
by a master eld [4] that satises a classical equation of motion. it has also been
conjectured that in this limit qcd is described by a string theory; the mesons are
string excitations that are free when n  . this idea is also supported by the
experimental fact that hadrons lie on linearly rising regge trajectories as required by
a string model. the fact that the large n expansion may be a good approximation
also for low values of n as n = 3 is suggested by the consistency of its predictions
with some phenomenological observations as for instance the validity of the zweigs
rule and the successful explanation of the u(1)-problem in the framework of the
large n expansion. this is also conrmed by recent lattice simulations [5]. the
concrete way in which the large n expansion explicitly solves the u(1)-problem is
reviewed in sect. 4. the fact, however, that any consistent string theories includes
necessarily gravity has led to call the string theory coming out from qcd, the qcd
string because, as qcd, it should not contain gravity. although many attempts
have been made to construct a qcd string none can be considered suciently
satisfactory. this problem has been with us for the last thirty years. in sect. 2
we will review the large n expansion in gauge theories and the various arguments
that brought people to think that, for large n, a string theory ought to emerge
from qcd. unfortunately, although the large-n expansion drastically simplies the
structure of qcd keeping only the planar diagrams, it has not yet been possible to
carry it out explicitly in the case of four-dimensional gauge theories. in order to
show some example in which the large n expansion can be explicitly performed in
sect. 3 we discuss it in the cp n1 model, where it has allowed us to study several
important aspects that these models share with qcd as for instance connement
and the u(1) problem, and in two-dimensional qcd, where a master eld picture
emerges and the spectrum of mesons can be explicitly computed.

recent studies of d branes have allowed to establish another deep connection
between gravity and gauge theories. in fact, on the one hand, a system of n d
p-branes is a classical solution of the low-energy string eective action, containing
gravity, dilaton and an antisymmetric r-r (p + 1)-form potential. the metric
corresponding to a d p-brane in d = 10 is given by:

(ds)2 = h1/2(y)dxdx + h 1/2(y)ijdyidyj

while the dilaton and rr potential are equal to:

e(0) = [h(y)](p3)/4

;

a01...p = [h(y)]1

where

h(y) = 1 +

with r2  yiyi and q = 2(q+1)/2/[(q + 1)/2]. the indices  and  run along the
world volume of the brane, while the indices i and j run along the directions that
are transverse to the brane.

on the other hand the low-energy dynamics of a system of n d p-branes is
described by the non abelian version of the born-infeld action that is a functional
of the transverse coordinates of the brane xi and of a gauge eld a living on the
brane. its complete form is not yet known, but for our considerations we can take
it of the form suggested in ref. [6]:

sbi =  (0)

p z dp+1 est r q det [g + b + 2f]

the brane tension is given by:

 (0)
p
gs

(2)1p

2gs

gs  e0

(1.8)

(1.9)

where the string coupling constant gs is identied with the value at innity of the
dilaton eld. g and b are the pullbacks of the metric g and of the two-form
ns-ns potential b, while f is a gauge eld living on the brane. st r stands
for a symmetrized trace over the group matrices. in addition to the term given in
eq.(1.8) the eective action for a d p-brane contains also a wess-zumino term that
we do not need to consider here. by expanding the born-infeld action in powers of
 we nd at the second order the kinetic term for a non abelian gauge eld (the
u(n) matrices are normalized as t r(titj) = 1

2ij):

sbi =

y m = 2gs(2)p2()(p3)/2

(1.10)

an interesting property of the d-brane solution in eqs.(1.5) and (1.6) is that for
large values of r the metric becomes at. therefore, being the curvature small, the
classical supergravity description provides a good approximation of the d brane.

based on the previous deep connection between gauge theories and type iib
supergravity or more in general type iib superstring and on the fact that the metric
of a d3-brane in the near-horizon limit becomes that of ads5  s5 maldacena [7]
made the conjecture that actually the low-energy eective action of a d3-brane,
that is given by n = 4 super yang-mills theory in four dimensions, is equivalent
to type iib string theory compactied on ads5  s5. a detailed discussion of the
maldacena conjecture is presented in sect. 7, while sect. 5 is devoted to general
properties of anti de sitter space and sect. 6 to the symmetry properties of both
n = 4 super yang-mills and type iib string theory.
the maldacena conjecture provides for the rst time a strong evidence that a
string theory comes out from a gauge theory. but n = 4 super yang-mills is in the
coulomb phase and therefore the emergence of a string has nothing to do with the
conning properties of the theory. in order to get a conning theory we have to get

5

rid of the conformal invariance of the theory. the simplest way of doing so is by
considering n = 4 super yang-mills at nite temperature, i.e. by considering its
euclidean version with compactied time. since bosons have periodic and fermions
anti-periodic boundary conditions, in going to nite temperature, we also break
supersymmetry. in order to deal with n = 4 super yang-mills at nite temperature
it is necessary to consider a nite temperature version of ads space [8]. this is
what we present in sect. 8, where, following witten [9], we actually see that we can
identify two manifolds both having as boundary the compactied minkowski four-
dimensional space. it turns out that one of them is dominant at low temperature
where the theory is still in the coulomb phase, while the other one is dominant
at high temperature where instead the theory is conning [9]. in the latter case
the wilson loop gives a contribution proportional to the area and from it one can
extract a nite string tension.
in this case the theory has a new phase at high
temperature characterized by connement and by the emergence of a mass gap [9].
from the point of view of type iib supergravity this is seen as the emergence of
another solution of the supergravity equations, namely the ads black hole, that
becomes dominant at high temperature, while empty ads space is still dominant
at low temperature. this is presented in sect. 8 where we also compute the wilson
loop, from which we can extract the string tension, the mass gap and more in
general the discrete spectrum of glue balls.

in the nal section 9 we discuss a recent proposal by witten [9] for studying four-
dimensional yang-mills theory starting from the m-theory 5-brane solution and we
compute in this approach the topological susceptibility and the string tension.

recent and some of them very detailed reviews on the ads/cft conjecture can

be found in refs. [10, 11, 12, 13, 14].

2 large n qcd

in this section we discuss some diagrammatical properties of large n qcd , we
show that, unlike the perturbative expansion, the large n expansion is an expansion
according to the topology of the diagrams and not in powers of the coupling constant
and we see that a picture in terms of an underlying string theory seems to naturally
emerge from it. at the end of this section we discuss the emergence of the master
eld.

qcd is a gauge eld theory based on the colour group su(3). it is an asymp-

totically free theory whose coupling constant in perturbation theory is given by:

s(q) =

4
3nf ) log q2
( 11
3 n  2

2

s 

g2
y m
4

(2.1)

where n = 3 and   250 mev is the fundamental scale of qcd. at high energy
(q2 >> 2) the coupling constant is small and therefore qcd is well described

for a recent review of the large n expansion in qcd see ref. [15].

6

by perturbation theory, but in order to study its low-energy properties as con-
nement, chiral symmetry breaking and the emergence of a mass gap we need
non-perturbative methods. one of them consists in putting qcd on a lattice and
use numerical simulations. in this way, however, we get only a numerical but not
a concrete understanding of connement based on a denite approximation. ac-
tually, when we formulate gauge theories on a lattice, it is rather easy to compute
various physical quantities in the strong coupling approximation and it is even not
so dicult to compute several terms of the strong coupling expansion. for instance
it is almost immediate to show that the vacuum expectation value of the wilson
loop has a leading term proportional to the area of the loop:

w (i, j) = eij log(n g2

y m )  eija2

(2.2)

where we have considered a rectangular wilson loop with sides of lenghts ia and ja
(a is the lattice spacing). according to the wilson connement criterium consisting
in the fact that the wilson loop is proportional to the area of the loop the behaviour
found in eq.(2.2) implies that the strong coupling limit of gauge theories connes
and that in this limit the string tension is given by:

 =

1
a2 log(ng2

y m )

(2.3)

in the same paper [16] in which wilson found that the wilson loop is proportional to
the area in strong coupling lattice gauge theory, it was also realized that the strong
coupling expansion of the wilson loop can be written as a sum over all surfaces as
in the relativistic string model. thus a string picture emerges from lattice gauge
theory for strong coupling. however the behaviour of lattice gauge theory for strong
coupling has in general nothing to do with the continuum limit of the theory, that
is the one we are interested in and that is obtained instead when the lattice spacing
a goes to zero corresponding, because of asymptotic freedom, to a weak coupling
limit:

a22

0 = e162/(0g2

y m (a))

0 =

nf

(2.4)

11
3

n 

2
3

where 0 is the qcd scale in some normalization scheme. according to the renor-
malization group a physical quantity as the string tension should show the same
behaviour in terms of the coupling constant as in eq.(2.4):

a2 = (cid:16)/2

0(cid:17) e162/(0g2

y m (a))

(2.5)

monte carlo numerical simulations have shown [17] that connement is indeed also
a property of the weak coupling limit in which the continuum theory is supposedly
recovered as one can see from the monte carlo data that show the exponential
behaviour with the coupling constant as in eq.(2.5).

however this limit cannot be performed analytically in some approximation. up

to now it has only been possible to reach it by numerical simulations.

7

since its original formulation [3] the large n expansion has been the most con-
crete possibility for reaching an analytical understanding of the non-perturbative
aspects of qcd including its connement properties. one generates a new expan-
sion parameter by introducing n instead of 3 colours. this means that we consider
an su(n) instead of an su(3) gauge theory.

in order to describe the large n expansion it is convenient to draw qcd feyn-
man diagrams in an apparently complicated notation [3]: a gluon propagator is
drawn as a pair of colour lines (each carrying a label going from 1 to n) and a
quark propagator as one colour and one avour-carrying line. when propagators
are joined through vertices (also written, of course, in double-line notation) one can
count, for each feynman diagram, its dependence upon the gauge coupling gy m ,
and the numbers of colour n and of avours nf . in t hoofts original expansion
one keeps the number of avours nf , as well as the combination g2
y m n, xed as n
goes to innity. the latter requirement follows from the need to keep qcd xed
(see eq.(2.1)), ensuring that meson masses approach a nite limit. the requirement
of keeping nf xed is less obvious (in nature, after all, n < nf ) but is crucial in
order to have vanishing mesonic widths (they behave like nf /n) and to establish
therefore a connection with tree-level string theory. therefore in the following we
will keep nf xed when n  .
following general properties:

by looking at specic examples it is easy to get convinced of the validity of the

1. if one considers a correlation function of gauge invariant operators and if one
looks at its dependence upon n and g2
y m n   one can see that the depen-
dence on  clearly varies with the order of the diagram, while the dependence
on n is only sensitive to its topological properties. thus the large n expan-
sion selects the topology of feynman diagrams rather than their order and
can pick up, at lowest order, important non-perturbative eects.

2. non-planar diagrams are down by a factor 1/n 2 with respect to the planar

ones.

3. diagrams with quark loops are down by a factor 1/n with respect to those

without quark loops.

because of this the diagrams that dominate in the large n limit are the planar

ones with the minimum number of quark loops.

let us consider a matrix element with two gauge invariant operators j(x) involv-
ing bilinears of quark elds as for instance  or . the dominant connected
diagrams contributing to a correlator containing two or more js are the planar
ones with only one quark loop lled in all possible ways by the gluon exchanges. it
is easy to see that the two and actually also the multipoint correlators are of order
n for large n

< j(k)j(k) > 0(n)

(2.6)

8

because the quark loop gives a factor n while all the gluon exchanges give something
that is constant if  is kept xed. since the diagram is planar it is easy to convince
oneself that, if one cuts it, the intermediate states consist of an ordered set of
partons starting from a quark and after many gluons ending on an antiquark and
that each parton shares colour indices with his nearest neighbours in the chain.
as a consequence the intermediate states are singlets of the gauge group and it is
natural to associate them with mesons. intermediate states with two mesons are
negligible at large n. one can then factorize the two-point correlators in terms of
a sum over meson contributions:

< j(k)j(k) >= xn

k2  m2

a2
n

n  0(n)

(2.7)

in the perturbative regime we can use perturbation theory where we can see that
the previous correlator behaves as a logarithm of k2. in order to reproduce this
logarithmic behaviour, we need an innite number of mesons. in addition, since the
meson masses, being proportional to , are smooth when n  , i.e. mn  0(1),
then the meson coupling, corresponding to the probability amplitude for a current
to create a meson, an =< 0|j|n > 0(n ) grows up as n.
it is natural to

associate intermediate states of this kind with string-like states of the form

|m(cxy) > m(cxy)|0 > (x)p e

ircxy

adx(y)|0 >

(2.8)

in which the path cxy can be seen as a string with quarks at its ends (p denotes a
path-ordered exponential and the trace is performed in group space).
similarly, for gauge invariant correlation functions of purely gluonic sources,

intermediate states at large nc have the same colour structure as :

|w(c) > w(c)|0 > t rp exp(cid:20)ic

dxa(x)(cid:21)|0 >

(2.9)

and are thus naturally associated with a closed string described by the path c.
let us consider now a correlator involving 3 currents j. it will be a function
of the three momenta p, r, s of the three operators.
it can contain three poles
respectively in the variables p2, r2 and s2 corresponding to the masses of the three
mesons or only two poles. the terms with three poles contains three couplings

an and a 3-meson vertex. since each an  0(n ) and the total expression is
0(n) then the 3-meson vertex is 0(1/n). this means that, for n   the

mesons are an innite number of stable particles. the large n expansion has the
nice property of separating the problem of the formation of hadrons connected to
quark connement and the generation of a mass gap from the problem of their
residual interaction. actually there are also some reasons to believe that mesons
are excitations of a string. already the representation of a meson given in eq.(2.8)
is strongly reminiscent of a string. in addition, the perturbative expansion in string
theory in terms of the string coupling constant gs and the large n expansion of gauge

9

s

theories in powers of 1/n are both topological expansions in the sense that they
are expansions according to the topology of respectively the string and the gauge
theory diagrams. in particular the planar diagrams, that are the dominant ones in
gauge theories, are pretty much reminiscent of the tree diagrams of string theory.
a tree diagram for the scattering of m mesons in string theory is of the order gm2
,
while the same amplitude for n   in gauge theory is of the order n1m/2.
a characteristic feature of the planar approximation, that we have already seen
above, is that the intermediate states are irreducible colour singlet, in the sense
that they cannot be split into two singlets. this is why the corresponding mesons
should have exactly zero width in the large n limit precisely as it is the case in
tree-level string theory. additional evidence for having a string theory coming out
from qcd comes from hadron phenomenology. in fact, if mesons are excitations
of strings they will lie on linearly rising regge trajectories as experiments seem
to indicate. there are also other aspects of hadron phenomenology that are well
explained (also numerically) by the large-n expansion as for instance the fact that
even the heavy hadrons have a small width relative to their mass. other ones are
the validity of the zweigs rule according to which for instance the meson  decays
in kk rather than in 3 pions as favoured by the phase space and the numerical
explanation of the u(1) problem.

if t hoofts considerations can be easily extended from mesons made by a quark-
antiquark pair to glueballs, predicting in particular their existence and narrowness,
the generalization to baryons is much more subtle. this is certainly related to the
fact that a baryon is, by denition, a completely antisymmetric object that one can
make out of n quarks. thus, unlike the mesonic case, the baryons wave-function
changes in an essential way with n and one cannot expect the large n limit to be
smooth. arguments can be given for the baryon mass to scale indeed like n and
therefore like 1/(1/n). if we identify 1/n with a coupling constant, such a behaviour
is reminiscent of the monopole mass, and indeed, witten (see refs. [18, 19]) has
taken up this analogy quite far. yet, the actual relevance of large n baryons for
the physical nucleon remains to be proven.

in conclusion we have seen that the large n expansion provides a very natural

framework for discussing this qcd reinterpretation of the old dual-string.

in the last part of this section we will briey discuss the idea of the master
eld. we have seen above that, if we restrict ourselves to connected diagrams, the
leading term of a correlator involving composites of the type  is 0(n), while that
of a correlator involving composites of the gluon is 0(n 2). it is, however, easy to
see that disconnected diagrams are in general dominating. therefore if we consider
the greens function of a collection of wilson-loop operators as the ones given in
eqs.(2.8) and (2.9):

< 0|m1   mnw1   wm|0 >

(2.10)

it is rather simple to prove that the leading large n diagrams cannot have any
propagator joining together two dierent operators. as a consequence the vev in

10

eq. (2.10) becomes the product of the vevs:

< 0|m1   mnw1   wm|0 >=

=< 0|m1|0 >    < 0|mn|0 >< 0|w1|0 >    < 0|wm|0 >

(2.11)

this almost trivial observation actually leads to a very deep result: the functional
integral dening our correlation functions must be dominated by a single eld,
the so-called master eld [4]. this result follows immediately from studying the
expectation value of the square of an operator which can be equal to the square of
the expectation value if and only if the quantum average is completely dominated
by one path (as in the classical theory).

this powerful result gave great hope that the large n limit of qcd could be
solved in closed form. there is a large literature discussing the many amazing
properties and equations satised by the master eld. we do not have time to
discuss it further here.

unfortunately, none of these approaches has lead so far to an explicit expression
for the large n limit of four dimensional qcd: nonetheless, the idea that some kind
of string must come out from qcd is still very popular. we know, however, that
any string model associated with qcd cannot coincide with the usual bosonic (or
super) string since these contain gravity (or supergravity), i.e.
interactions which
are not contained in qcd.

these problems have also brought several people to think that the qcd string
is not innitely thin but has a nite cross section. may be the relevant model is
some kind of bag model with stringlike congurations.

although no string model has yet been derived in a rigorous way from qcd, we

have presented a number of indications supporting such a connection.

in conclusion, the large n expansion is a very promising approach to understand
non-perturbative properties of qcd as connement, chiral symmetry breaking and
the generation of a mass gap, but, although it drastically simplies the structure
of qcd keeping only the planar diagrams, it has not been possible to perform
it explicitly and arrive to an explicit computation there are also a number of
indications supporting the idea that a string model is coming out from qcd. this
has been, however, clashing with the fact that all consistent string models contain
gravity, while qcd does not.

3 the large n expansion in cp n1 model

we have concluded the previous section by seeing that it has not been possible to
explicitly perform the large n expansion in a matrix theory as qcd. we call it
matrix theory because the gluon eld is a matrix of su(n). in the rst part of this
section we study the properties of a very interesting two-dimensional vector model,
called the cp n1 model with fermions, because, on the one hand, it has many
properties in common with qcd as classical conformal invariance, existence of a

topological charge, instanton solutions, connement and u(1) anomaly and, on the
other hand, it can be explicitly solved in the large n limit. this model has been very
useful in the past as a toy model for qcd. although, unlike other two-dimensional
models, connement is in this model a quantum eect, the study of connement in
this model has not helped very much to understand connement in qcd because
connement in two dimension is substantially dierent from connement in four
dimensions.
it has instead been very useful for understanding how to solve the
u(1) problem in qcd.

the action of the cp n1 model with fermions is given by :

s = z d2x(cid:26)dzdz +  (6d  mb)  

g

2nf h( i)2 + ( i5)2i(cid:27)

(3.1)

the scalar eld z has a colour index that transforms according to the fundamental
representation of su(n), while the fermion eld has a colour index that takes
values from 1 to nf together with a avour index that transforms according to the
fundamental of su(nf ). d is the covariant derivative of a u(1) gauge eld a
and the scalar eld z satises a constraint:

|z|2 =

n
2f

d =  +

2ief
n

a

(3.2)

e is taken to be equal to 1 in the covariant derivative for z.

in order to study the quantum theory of the model one must compute the

generating functional for the euclidean greens functions given by:

z(j, j, , ) = z dzdzdd (|z|2 
exp(cid:26)s +z d2xh j  z + z  j +    +   i(cid:27)

)

n
2f

one can eliminate the quartic terms for the  eld by the introduction of auxiliary
elds and one can use the integral form of the  function. in this way the action
in the previous equation will contain only terms that are at most quadratic in the
elds z and . therefore the functional integral over those elds can be explicitly
performed and one gets:

although the eective lagrangian is more complicated than the original microscopic
lagrangian, it has, however, the advantage of containing directly the meson elds
 and 5, while the quark  and the gluon z elds have been integrated out.
the integral over the remaining composite els cannot be performed exactly and
we must develop the action for large n and nf keeping the number of avours nf
xed. in addition we must also make this expansion around a minimum and such
a minimum occurs for a non zero vacuum expectation value for the elds  and .
actually in the rst eq. in (3.5) the term m2 corresponding to the v.e.v. of  has
been already explicitly extracted. in the case in which the quark mass matrix is
diagonal we can take the vacuum expectation values as follows:

< 0 >= msqnf nf

< i >=< 0

5 >=< i

5 >= 0

,

i 6= 0

(3.7)

the index zero corresponds to the singlet eld. expanding then the eective action
around such a minimum we get that the leading term for large n is equal to:

where the tilde indicates the fourier transform

m = mb + ms

(3.8)

(3.9)

the integrals appearing in eq.(3.8) are ultraviolet divergent. they can be regular-
ized by the introduction of a pauli-villars cut-o . then the saddle point condition
s(1) = 0 requires the bare coupling constants f and g to vary with  according to
the equations:

f ()

(3.10)

which are typical of an asymptotic free theory. in addition, as also in qcd, there
is a dimensional transmutation because in the quantum theory the dimensionless
coupling constants f and g are traded with the two masses m and m.

having eliminated the term s(1) we can consider the quadratic part of sef f that

is independent of n and nf and that is given by:

in conclusion the leading term in 1/n describes a free theory of mesons that are
composite elds of the fundamental quark and gluon elds. higher order terms
in the large n expansion will describe the meson interaction.

let us now discuss the physical properties of this model. because of asymptotic
freedom its short distance properties are completely analogous to those of qcd.
unlike qcd we are able in this case to analytically study for large n and nf also
its low energy properties. in particular by using the low-energy expansion:

a(p; m2) 

1

4m2 "1 

2
3

p2

4m2 + . . .#

(3.17)

we can extract from eq.(3.11) the low energy eective lagrangian that in the sim-
plied case where nf = e = 1 is given by:

and

(3.18)

(3.19)

(3.20)

an important property of this model is the generation of a kinetic term for the
vector eld a that was not present in the classical theory. in two dimension this

14

implies the generation of a conning linear potential with string tension equal to
 = (12m2)/n. the factor 1/n comes from the coupling between coloured
states and a. another important property that is pretty much related to the
previous one is the appearence of a dependence on the  vacuum parameter in the
large n expansion. in fact if we introduce the topological charge density

q(x) =

1

2n

f (x)

(3.21)

where f is the eld dened in eq.(3.19), we neglect all terms in eq.(3.18) that
include mesonic elds and we add a term with the vacuum  parameter we are led
to consider the following eective lagrangian:

lef f =

1
2

n
3m2 q2 + iq + qj

(3.22)

where j is an external source. the algebraic equation of motion for q that one gets
from the previous lagrangian is

q = 

3m2
n

(j + i)

inserting it in eq.(3.22) we get the following generating functional:

z(j, )  ew (j,) = e

3m2

2n r d2x(j+i)2

from it putting j = 0 we can extract the vacuum energy

e()  w (, 0) =

3m2
2n

the one-point function for the topological charge density

< q(x) >= i

3m2
n



and the two-point function for q

< q(x)q(y) >=

3m2
n

(x  y)

notice that the vacuum energy has the form

(3.23)

(3.24)

(3.25)

(3.26)

(3.27)

e() = nf (/n)

f (x) = x2

(3.28)

where the factor n in front counts just the number of degrees of freedom. from
eq.(3.27) we can compute the topological susceptibility:

< q(x)z d2yq(y) >=

d2e()
d2 =

3m2
n

(3.29)

15

another important property of this model is the presence in the eective low-energy
lagrangian in eq.(3.18) of a mixed term with the singlet axial eld and the vector
eld that is fundamental for the resolution of the u(1) problem. we do not discuss
further this here since in the next section we will be discussing its resolution in
qcd.

in the second part of this section we consider qcd in two dimensions (qcd2)
and we show that in the light cone gauge it is possible to reformulate it completely
in terms of a bilocal mesonic eld [21, 22]. we then show that the master eld,
corresponding to the vacuum expectation value of the bilocal mesonic eld, is xed
in the limit of a large number of colours by a saddle point equation whose solution
is equal to the fermion propagator constructed in the original paper by t hooft [23].
considering then the quadratic term containing the uctuation around the saddle
point it is possible to show that the equation of motion constructed from it gives
exactly the integral equation found in ref. [23] for the mesonic spectrum.

we consider the action

s = z d2x (

where f = a a+i[a, a], i 6dab = (i 1labaa
are the indices of the adjoint representation of the colour group, a, b = 1...n run
over the fermionic representation of the colour su(n).
if we choose the gauge

let us now consider the mass spectrum of the theory, i.e. the uctuations around
the master eld. to this purpose we write u = u0 + 1n
u, and we consider the
terms in the eective action that are o(1) in n. they are given by the quadratic

in conclusion in this section we have considered two two-dimensional models,
the cp n1 model and qcd2, in which the large-n expansion can be explicitly
done, and we have studied their properties for n  . in particular in the case
of qcd2 we have constructed the master eld and the spectrum of mesons in the
large-n limit.

4 u (1) problem

in this section we discuss the resolution of the u(1) problem in the framework of
the large n expansion of qcd. in addition to colour gauge symmetry qcd has
also a avour symmetry. if the quark mass matrix is zero qcd is invariant under
the transformations corresponding to independent u(nf ) rotations of the right and
left parts of the quark eld:

l 

1  5

2

  ull

r 

1 + 5

2

  urr

(4.1)

where both ur and ul are u(nf ) matrices. this ul(nf )  ur(nf ) symmetry of
the qcd action is called chiral symmetry.
in the quantum theory qcd has an
anomaly given by :

j 

5 = 2nf q(x)

q(x) =

g2
642 f a

f a


(4.2)

where q(x) is the topological charge density of qcd. as a consequence, qcd with
massless quarks has only a sul(nf )  sur(nf )  uv (1) where uv (1) corresponds
to the baryonic number conservation. in the real world chiral symmetry can only
be an approximate symmetry because quarks have a non zero mass. however,
if we restrict ourselves to the three light avours, it is an approximate symmetry
because their masses are small with respect to the qcd scale qcd. since, however,
this symmetry is not seen in the spectrum (there is no scalar particle that has
approximately the same mass of the pion!), it is assumed (and this assumption is
conrmed by lattice numerical simulations) that in qcd it is spontaneously broken.
the vectorial su(nf ) symmetry, that is left unbroken, is instead an approximate
classication symmetry for the hadrons. as a consequence of the spontaneous
breaking of chiral symmetry we get that the pseudoscalar mesons are the quasi
goldstone bosons corresponding to the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry
and their low energy interaction can be exactly computed.
in particular at low
energy we can neglect all hadrons except those that are massless in the chiral limit.
the eective lagrangian describing the quasi goldstone bosons is that of the non
linear -model:

l =

1
2

t r(cid:16)uu1(cid:17) +

f
22

t r(cid:16)mu + mu(cid:17)

(4.3)

where u is a 3  3 or nf  nf matrix containing the elds of the pseudoscalar
mesons:

the fact that the resolution of the u (1) problem is intimately connected to the existence of

u =

ei2/f

f2

the axial anomaly was suggested in ref. [24].

22

 = ii + 1ls/qnf

t r(cid:16)ij(cid:17) = ij

(4.4)

while the mass matrix m can be taken to be diagonal:

mij = 2

i ij

(4.5)

in the chiral limit (m = 0) the lagrangian in eq.(4.3) is invariant under chiral
transformations that transform u  uluur and therefore cannot be the eective
lagrangian for low-energy qcd because it does not contain the u(1) anomaly in
eq.(4.2). in order to have the anomaly equation satised we must add to the pre-
vious lagrangian terms that also include the eld corresponding to the topological
charge q(x) appearing in the r.h.s. of the anomaly equation. on general ground we
can write the following lagrangian:

l =



xi=0

li(u)[q(x)]i

(4.6)

where the rst term with i = 0 is equal to the kinetic term in eq.(4.3). neglecting
derivative terms, that are irrelevant at low energy, requiring parity conservation
and imposing that the axial anomaly is reproduced (this implies that, under an
axial u(1) transformation with angle , the previous lagrangian transforms as
l  l 2nf q(x)) we get that all terms of the sum with even indices are invariant
under the complete u(nf )  u(nf ) symmetry, all the terms with odd indices are
vanishing except the rst one that is given by

l1 =

i
2

q(x)t rhlog u  log u1i

(4.7)

(4.8)

this term precisely reproduces in the eective theory the anomaly equation.
in
order to have additional restrictions we need to use the large n expansion. using
the arguments developed in sect. 2 it is easy to check the following behaviour with
n:

f  0(n)

l2k  0(n 22k)

this means that, for large n, we can neglect all even terms except the lowest one.
keeping only the leading terms in the large n expansion we arrive at the following
lagrangian:

l = l0(u) +

i
2

q(x)t rhlog u  log u1i +

af 2


q2 +

f
22

t r(cid:16)mu + mu(cid:17)  q

(4.9)
where a is an arbitrary parameter that is 0(1/n) for large n and we have also
allowed for an arbitrary  parameter.

it is now convenient to use the algebraic equation of motion for q(x) to bring

eq.(4.9) in the following form :

l = l0(u) +

f

t r(cid:16)mu + mu(cid:17) 

af 2

t r(cid:16)log u  log u1(cid:17)(cid:21)2

the resolution of the u (1) problem in the framework of the large n expansion was given in
ref. [25, 26]. see also ref. [27]. the eective lagrangian in eq.(4.10) was derived in refs. [28, 29,
30].

(4.10)

23

since uu is proportional to the unit matrix and the mass matrix is diagonal we
can take the vacuum expectation value of u to be of the following form:

< uij >= eiiij

f2

(4.11)

where the angles i are determined imposing that < uij > minimizes the energy
corresponding to the lagrangian in eq.(4.10) that is given by:

e =

(4.12)

after having used eq.(4.11). hence they must satisfy the following equations:

2

(4.13)

it is convenient to work with a eld v whose vacuum expectation value is propor-
tional to the unit matrix. in terms of u it is given by:

vij = uik < ukj >1 f2

and the lagrangian in eq.(4.10) becomes:

since we are interested only in those results that follow from current algebra we can

where the term implied by the axial anomaly has generated a mass term for the

the mass spectrum of the pseudoscalar mesons can just be obtained from the

(4.19)

(4.20)

where the matrices 
ij are the nf (nf 1) generators of su(nf ) that do not belong
to the cartan subalgebra and we insert it in eq.(4.19) we get the following two-point
functions:

< (x) (y) >f.t = i

(4.22)

is the inverse of the fol-

aij(p2) = (p2  2

(4.23)

and b is a matrix having all elements equal to 1. the masses of the physical
states can be obtained diagonalizing the mass matrix and are given by the following
identity:

in the chiral limit (i  0) one gets n 2

(4.25)

since a  1/n we see that the mass of the singlet is governed in the large-n limit by
the same factor nf /n as the coecient of the axial anomaly in eq.(4.2). therefore
we see that the resolution of the u(1) problem is intimately related to the existence
of a non vanishing axial anomaly.

a numerical comparison of the spectrum predicted by the mass formula given
in eq.(4.24) with the experimental values of the pseudoscalar masses has been done
in ref. [26] in the case of three avours. in the limit where 1, 2 << 3 one gets
the following masses for the  and :

m 2


= m2

k +

dened by the relation

| >= cos |8 > + sin |1 >

(4.27)

(4.28)

from eq.(4.26) we can use the masses of  and  to determine the parameter a.
we get a  0.24(gev )2. using this value for a and neglecting the square term in
the square root in eq.(4.26) one gets:

a = 0.95(gev )2

(4.29)

(4.30)

that are very close to the experimental values given respectively by 0.30(gev )2 and
0.92(gev )2. one gets also  = 14o that is very close to the experimental value
 = 11o. the phenomenological lagrangian that we have used give values for the
masses that are in good agreement with the experimental ones. the resolution of
the u(1) problem implies that the parameter a must be dierent from zero. it can
be computed in pure yang-mills theory by computing the following correlator:

t  iz d4y < q(x)q(y) >y.m.=

2

af 2


(4.31)

that in the literature is known as the topological susceptibility. from the value of a
obtained from the spectrum of pseudoscalar mesons we get the following value for
the topological susceptibility:

t = (180mev )4

(4.32)

lattice calculation have conrmed this result [31].

at the end of this section we want to discuss the  dependence that follows from
the eective lagrangian in eq.(4.18). we start noticing that, if we consider the
lagrangian in eq.(4.9), we neglect the terms that come from the fermions and that
therefore depend on u and we add a source term (ijq), we have a lagrangian
that has precisely the same structure as the corresponding one for the cp n1 model
given in eq.(3.22). this means that also in this case we get

z(j, )  eiw (j,) = eiaf 2

 (+ij)2/4

from it we can compute the vacuum energy:

e() = w (0, ) =

af 2

4

2

26

(4.33)

(4.34)

and of course the topological susceptibility given in eq.(4.31). using eq.(4.25) we
can recast eq.(4.34) in the form:

m 2

s =

2nf
f 2


d2e()

d2

|=0

(4.35)

that is the famous wittens relation [25].

the dependence on the  parameter for the various physical quantities is ob-
tained by solving eqs.(4.13) that minimize the vacuum energy in eq.(4.12). they
cannot be solved in general analytically. they imply that physics is periodic in 
with period equal to 2. in fact, if i = (0)
i (, i, a) is a solution of eq.(4.13), then,
for    + 2, the solution can be taken for instance to be of the following form:
(4.36)

1( + 2) = i + 2

i( + 2) = i

i 6= 1

with no eect on the physics because the physical quantities depend on eii. this
means in particular that the vacuum energy must be a periodic function of 

e( + 2) = e()

(4.37)

however this does not necessarily mean a 2 periodicity of each solution of eq.(4.13).
in general one needs to shift from a solution to another at some particular value of
 (typically at  = ) in order to keep the minimum energy. this can be seen very
clearly for instance in the case of two avours with 1 = 2   for a >>  where
from eq.(4.13) one nds  = 2. inserting it in the vacuum energy in eq.(4.12) one
gets

e() = f 2

 2s 1 + cos 

2

(4.38)

this shows that at  =  we shift from a solution to another solution in order to
minimize the energy. because of this the vacuum energy is periodic with period 2
and not 4!!

let us consider now the case of one avour and assume instead that the quantity
x  a/2 is very small. in this limit eq.(4.13) can be solved as a power expansion
in x and we get [25]:

 = 2k + x(  2k) + 0(2kx)2

(4.39)

where k is an integer such that (2kx)2 is small. but since a  1/n for large n
more and more values of k are allowed. for very large n the number of allowed
values of k is proportional to n. for each value of  only one value of k is the true
vacuum, the others correspond to metastable states. if we insert the solution given
in eq.(4.39) in eq.(4.12) we get for small x:

e() =

af 2

4

mink(  2k)2

27

(4.40)

for  <  < , k = 0 corresponds to the true vacuum, but for  >  then the
value k = 1 corresponds to the true vacuum and so on. extracting a n 2 factor
required by large n counting we can rewrite eq.(4.40) as follows:

e() = n 2 af 2
4



n !2
mink    2k

(4.41)

in conclusion we have found that the vacuum energy must be a periodic function
of  (see eq.(4.37)) and at the same time must be of the form:

e() = n 2cf ((  2k)/n)

f (x) = x2

(4.42)

this is only possible if we get a multibranched solution of eq.(4.13).

5 anti de sitter space

in this section we give some detail about anti de sitter space in d  n + 1 dimen-
sions. de sitter or anti de sitter spaces correspond to solutions of the pure gravity
equations in presence of a cosmological term. the action of pure gravity with a
cosmological term is given by

s = s

1

16gd z ddxq|g|(r + )

(5.1)

the factor s in front of the action is s = 1 if we work with a minkowski metric with
mostly minus or with a euclidean metric, while s = 1 in the case of a minkowski
metric with mostly plus. from the previous action we can immediately derive the
following eq. of motion:

r 

1
2

gr =

g

1
2

(5.2)

(5.3)

that implies that the scalar curvature is a constant:

r =

d
2  d



r =



2  d

g

de sitter space corresponds to the case  < 0, while anti de sitter space corresponds
to the opposite case ( > 0).

adsn+1 can be easily represented by embedding it in a at (n + 2)-dimensional
space. let me call ya  (y0, y1, . . . yn, yn+1) the coordinates of the embedding space
with diagonal metric equal to ab = (+1,1, . . .  1, +1). then adsn+1 can be
shown to be the locus characterized by the following equation:

y2 = y2

0 + y2

n+1 

i = b2
y2

n

xi=1

(5.4)

28

where b is a constant anti de sitter radius. it can be shown that the previous eq.
implies the two eqs. in eq.(5.3) provided that we make the following identication:

 =

n(n  1)

b2

(5.5)

another way of representing adsn+1 is through the stereographic projection:

y0 = 

1 + x2
1  x2

y = 

2x
1  x2

 = 1, . . . n + 1

(5.6)

where x2 = (x1)2 + . . . + (xn)2  (xn+1)2. according to the previous transformation
we can use the variables  and x instead of y0 and y to represent the embedding
space. starting from the at metric in the embedding space:

ds2 = (dy0)2 + (dyn+1)2  d(~y)2

one can rewrite it by using the relations in eq.(5.6) and one gets

ds2 = d2 

42

(1  x2)2 (dx)2

for xed  = b we get the metric of adsn+1:

g =

4b2

(1  x2)2 

(5.7)

(5.8)

(5.9)

where the metric  is with mostly plus.

another parametrization of adsn+1 is the one that appears in the near horizon
limit of a d 3-brane. if we work in minkowski space we can introduce the variables

u = y0 + iyn+1

v = y0  iyn+1

(5.10)

while in euclidean space, corresponding to changing the sign in front of the term
(yn+1)2, we can introduce the alternative variables:

u = y0 + yn+1

v = y0  yn+1

in both cases one can rewrite eq.(5.4) as follows:

y2 = uv  ~y2 = b2

(5.11)

(5.12)

introducing the new variables b  = y/u for  = 1, . . . , n and inserting it in
eq.(5.12) we can extract v as a function of  and u:

v = b2(cid:18)~2u +

1

u(cid:19)

29

(5.13)

then from the at embedding metric in eq.(5.7) written in terms of the variables
u and v we get:

(ds)2 = b2  du2

u2 + u2d~2!

(5.14)

after having used the following equations:

dv = 2b2~  d~u + b2~2udu 

b2
u2 du

d~y = bud~ + b~du

(5.15)

anti de sitter space has a boundary that is obtained by rescaling the variables:

y  ry

u  ru

v  rv

(5.16)

with r > 0 and by taking r  . in this way we get that the boundary is the
manifold satisfying the eq.

2

uv  ~y

= 0

(5.17)

but since tr is as good as r the boundary will be described by the two equations:

uv  ~y2 = 0

(u, v, ~y)  (tu, tv, t~y)

(5.18)

with t > 0. we can drop the second condition by just choosing t in such a way that

~y2 = 1 = uv = y2

0 + y2

n+1

(5.19)

this means that the boundary has the topology of s1  sn1, that is the same
topology of compactied minkowski space with euclidean compactied time. the
usual minkowski space is recovered when we uncompactify the two spheres.

in the last part of this section we introduce additional parametrizations of ads
space. the rst one is obtained by introducing the coordinates (z, ~x) = (1/u, ~). in
these coordinates the ads metric in eq.(5.14) becomes

ds2 = b2 dz2 + d~x2

z2

(5.20)

the second one corresponds to the cylinder coordinates dened by the following
eqs.:

yn+1 = b cosh  cos 

;

y0 = b cosh  sin 

where ei stands for a unit vector in n dimensions. in terms of the previous variables
one gets the following metric for adsn+1:

yi = b sinh ei

(5.21)

ds2 =  cosh2 d 2 + d2 + sinh2 d2

n1

in minkowski space and

ds2 = d2 + sinh2 d2
n

30

(5.22)

(5.23)

in euclidean space where instead the variables used in the previous equation are
dened by

y0 = b cosh 

,

yi = b sinh ei

i = 1, . . . n + 1

(5.24)

in terms of the embedding space coordinates. the cavity coordinates r and  are
instead obtained from the ones in eq.(5.20) through the following relations:

where

z =  cos 

;

xi =  sin ei

 = e

;

cos  =

1  r2
1 + r2

in terms of those coordinates the metric of adsn+1 becomes:

1  r2!2
ds2 = b2  1 + r2

d 2 +

4b2

(1  r2)2 hdr2 + r2d2

n1i

(5.25)

(5.26)

(5.27)

an interesting property of ads space is that a light ray can reach its boundary in
nite time. in fact from the metric in eq.(5.27) a light ray is characterized by the
eq.

integrating the previous equation from the points (r = 0,  = 0) and (r = 1, t )
corresponding respectively to the center of ads space at  = 0 and its boundary
at  = t we get:

this means that a light ray starting from the center of ads space reaches its
boundary and comes back to the center in a time interval equal to .

6 n = 4 super yang-mills and type iib string
in this section we review the main properties of both n = 4 super yang-mills
theory and the type iib string.
in order to derive the lagrangian of n = 4 super yang-mills it is convenient
to start from n = 1 super yang-mills in ten dimensions and then dimensionally
reduce it to four dimensions. if we do this we obtain the following lagrangian for
n = 4 super yang-mills:

n = 4 super yang-mills is invariant under an internal su(4) symmetry group

to introduce the eld:

lagrangian in eq.(6.1) can also be written in the n = 1 supereld formalism.

n = 4 super yang-mills has no trace anomaly in the sense that the trace of the
energy-momentum tensor is zero also in the full quantum theory.
it is a nite
quantum eld theory. as we have seen above it is also invariant under a su(4)
r-invariance. this symmetry is not manifest in the formulation with n = 1 super-
elds. only a su(3)  u(1) symmetry is manifest in this formulation. the su(3)
corresponds to a su(3) rotation of the three superelds i, while the u(1) acts on
the four superelds as:

i()  ei2/3i(ei)

w()  eiw(ei)

(6.13)

according to the previous eqs. the fermions of the three superelds i have chiral
weight equal to 1/3, while the fermion of the supereld w has chiral weight equal
to 1. this means that the sum of their chiral weights is vanishing implying that
n = 4 super yang-mills has no u(1) axial anomaly. finally the action in eq.(6.1)
is also invariant under conformal supersymmetry transformations. they can be
obtained by dimensionally reducing the n = 1 supersymmetry transformations
in ten dimensions. since the spinor in ten dimensions is a weyl-majorana spinor
the ten-dimensional theory is invariant under 16 supersymmetries. on the other
hand the four-dimensional quantum theory is conformal invariant and therefore it
is also invariant under the same supersymmetry transformations as before, but with
a supersymmetry parameter  = x that is space-time dependent, while  is
space-time independent. they correspond to additional 16 supersymmetries and
therefore we conclude that n = 4 super yang-mills in four dimensions is invariant
under 32 supersymmetries.
finally there is a very strong evidence that n = 4 super yang-mills is invariant
under sl(2, z) transformations that act on the complex coupling constant  dened
in terms of the gauge coupling constant and the -parameter as:

under sl(2, z) is a precise way of stating that this theory satises the montonen-
olive [32] duality in the sense that it can be equivalently formulated as a theory
of fundamental w -mesons having magnetic monopoles as solitons or as a theory
of fundamental magnetic monopoles with the w -mesons appearing as solitons, the
two formulations having essentially the same lagrangian.

type iib string is a theory of closed superstrings involving both right and left
movers. the right and left spinors in the r sector have the same chirality. there-
fore it is a chiral theory with no gauge and gravitational anomalies. it is a n = 2
supersymmetric theory in ten dimensions; this means that it contains 32 super-
symmetry charges. these supersymmetries are kept also when one compacties it
on the background ads5  s5. in the massless bosonic sector the ten dimensional
theory contains a graviton g, a dilaton , an axion eld , two 2-form potentials
b(1)
 and b(2)
 and a 4-form potential a with self-dual eld strenght, while the
massless fermionic sector consists of two gravitinos and two dilatinos having both
the same chirality.
if we forget for a moment the r-r self-dual 5-form eld the
low-energy eective lagrangian for type iib theory has the following form:

siib =

t r(mm1)

h tmh(cid:21)

(6.15)

where we have combined the eld strenghts h (1), corresponding to the ns-ns po-
tential, and h (2), corresponding to the r-r potential, in a two-component vector
h = db and the two scalar elds in the symmetric sl(2, r) matrix:

with

m = e  ||2

(6.16)

(6.17)

this action is manifestly invariant under the global sl(2, r) transformation:

m  mt

h  (t )1h

 =   a b
c d !

(6.18)

the metric in the einstein frame and the 4-form potential are left invariant by the
sl(2, r) transformation. in terms of the matrix  previously dened we get that

 

a + b
c + d

h (1)  dh (1)  ch (2)

h (2)  bh (1) + ah (2)

(6.19)

in particular the transformation on the matrix m given in eq.(6.18) implies that
the quantity  dened in eq.(6.17) transforms exactly as  in eq.(6.14). although
the low-energy lagrangian is invariant under a sl(2, r) symmetry it can be seen
that it reduces to an sl(2, z) symmetry in the quantum theory in order to have
the dirac quantization condition satised.

in conclusion we have seen that both n = 4 super yang-mills and type iib

string theory compactied on ads5  s5 have the same symmetries.

7 the maldacena conjecture

in the introduction we have seen how a system of n d 3-branes is, on the one
hand, a classical solution of the supergravity equations of motion containing the
metric, the dilaton and the self-dual 5-form eld strenght and, on the other hand,
is described by the born-infeld action that at low energy reduces to the yang-
mills action in eq.(1.10) with gauge group u(n) or more precisely to its n = 4
supersymmetric extension. but is it possible to nd a more precise connection or
even an equivalence between the world volume n = 4 supersymmetric yang-mills
theory and supergravity or better superstring that is a consistent quantum theory?
the key to answer this question came from comparing [33, 34] the low energy
absorption cross sections of massless bulk elds as graviton and dilaton computed
either by using the supergravity classical solution or the born-infeld action. to great
surprise it was found that the two calculations exactly agree [33, 34]. moreover, if
one studies the range of validity of the two previous calculations, it clearly appears
that the one based on supergravity is expected to give an exact information on
n = 4 super yang-mills theory for large t hooft coupling (  ) [33].
these properties of a system of n d 3-branes together with the observation [7]
that it is the region around the throat of metric of the d 3-branes that is the
fundamental one to connect the supergravity solution with n = 4 super yang-
mills, brought maldacena [7] to conjecture that n = 4 super yang-mills should be
somehow equivalent to type iib string theory compactied on ads5  s5 that is in
fact the metric in the throat region. in the following we will briey sketch the main
lines of his argumentation.

let us consider the low-energy limit of the born-infeld action for a system of n
d 3-branes and of the bulk supergravity action. since it amounts to take the limit
  0 with both gs and n xed, in this limit we obtain the action of n = 4 super
yang-mills, that we have discussed in sect. 6 and that is the low-energy limit of the
born-infeld action together with free gravitons. this is a consequence of the fact
that both the interaction between bulk elds as for instance the graviton and that
between bulk elds and those living on the brane as the yang-mills elds, being
proportional to the newtons constant   ()2, go to zero when   0.
on the other hand if we look at the classical solution in eqs.(1.5), (1.6) and (1.7)
we see that it interpolates between at ten-dimensional minkowski metric obtained
for r   and a metric with a long throat obtained in the limit r  0. in particular
for p = 3 the metric is non singular when r  0 and in this limit becomes that of
ads5  s5. more precisely this can be seen by taking the near-horizon limit of a
system of n d 3-branes dened by

r  0

  0

u 

r


= f ixed

(7.1)

where the regge slope is taken to zero, while u is kept xed. in this limit we can

35

neglect the factor 1 in the function h in eq.(1.7) and the metric in eq.(1.5) becomes:

(ds)2
 

u 2

4ngs

(dx3+1)2 +

4ngs

u 2

du 2 +q4ngsd2

5

(7.2)

this is the metric of the manifold ads5  s5 where the two radii of ads5 and s5
are equal and given by:

r2

ads5 = r2

s5  b2 = q4ngs

(7.3)

that, using the relation g2

y m = 4gs following from eq.(1.10) for p = 3, implies:

b2


= qng2

y m

(7.4)

if we have suciently soft gravitons (i.e. gravitons with wave lenght much bigger
than the radius of the throat b) outside the throat they cannot interact with the
excitations far down in the throat as it is conrmed by the fact that their absorption
cross-section is vanishing at low energy. on the other hand a string excitation far
down inside the the throat, although its proper energy (the energy measured in the
reference frame instantaneously at rest at r) diverges at low energy (  0), being
proportional to ep  1/, is not negligible because its energy measured in the
frame of reference where the time is the one appearing in the rst term of the r.h.s.
of eq.(7.2) is given by:

= u

(7.5)

et 

ep

that is kept xed in the limit   0. therefore from the point of view of the
classical solution we are left with free gravitons and all the string excitations living
far down inside the throat that are described by type iib string theory compactied
on ads5 s5. by comparing this result with the one obtained from the born-infeld
action maldacena has formulated the conjecture that n = 4 super yang-mills is
equivalent to type iib string theory compactied on ads5s5. the precise relation
between the parameters of the gauge and string theory is given in eq.(7.3), where n
is equal to the number of colours in the gauge theory and to the ux of the 5-form
eld strenght in the supergravity solution. since the classical solution in eq.(7.2) is
a good approximation when the radii of ads5 and s5 are very big

b2


>> 1 = ng2

y m   >> 1 ,

(7.6)

in the strong coupling limit of the gauge theory we can restrict ourselves to the
type iib supergravity compactied on ads5  s5.
in conclusion, according to the maldacena conjecture, classical supergravity is a
good approximation if  >> 1, while in the t hooft limit in which  is kept xed for
n   classical string theory is a good approximation for n = 4 super yang-mills.

36

in the t hooft limit in fact string loop corrections are negligible (gs << 1) as it
follows from the equation:  = 4gsn for  xed and n  . finally yang-mills
perturbation theory is a good approximation when  << 1.
the strongest evidence for the validity of the maldacena conjecture comes from
the fact that both n = 4 super yang-mills and type iib string compactied on
ads5  s5 have the same symmetries. they are, in fact, both invariant under 32
supersymmetries, under the conformal group o(4, 2), corresponding to the isome-
tries of ads5, under the r-symmetry group su(4), corresponding to the isometries
of s5 and under the montonen-olive duality [32] based on the group sl(2, z).

if the maldacena conjecture is true, as as it seems to be implied by the many
positive checks of its validity, then this is the rst time that a string theory is
recognized to come out from a gauge theory. in particular it is important to stress
that this does not contradict the fact mentioned earlier that a string theory contains
gravity while the gauge theory does not, because in this case the two theories live in
dierent spaces: iib string theory lives on ads5s5, while n = 4 super yang-mills
lives on the boundary of ads5 that is our four-dimensional minkowski space. the
equivalence between the two previous theories realizes the holographic idea [35, 36]
that a quantum theory of gravity is supposed to satisfy. a new puzzle, however,
arises in this case because we usually connect a string theory with a conning gauge
theory, while instead n = 4 super yang-mills is a conformal invariant theory and
therefore is in the coulomb and not in the conning phase. the fact that n = 4
super yang-mills is in a coulomb phase is conrmed by the calculation of the wilson
loop where a coulomb potential between two test charges is found [37].

if two theories, as the type iib string theory compactied on ads5  s5 and
n = 4 super yang-mills theory, are equivalent then it must be possible to specify for
each eld q(x) of the boundary minkowski theory the corresponding eld (y) of
the bulk string theory and to show that, when we compute corresponding correlators
in the two theories, we get the same result. in particular, in the boundary theory
one can easily compute the generating functional for correlators involving q(x)

z(0) =< er d4x0(x)q(x) >

(7.7)

by taking derivatives with respect to the arbitrary source 0(x) one can compute
any correlator involving the boundary eld q(x). in refs. [39, 40] the recipy for
computing z(0) in the bulk theory has been given. first of all one must identify
0(x) with the boundary value of the eld (y), which lives in the bulk theory
and that corresponds to the composite q(x) of the boundary theory. then the
generating functional given in eq.(7.7) can just be obtained by performing in the
bulk theory the functional integral over  with the restriction that its boundary
value be 0:

z(0) = z0

d es[]

(7.8)

in computing the previous functional integral we can use classical supergravity in
the regime where  >> 1. otherwise for an arbitrary value of xed  for n  

37

we need to compute the tree diagrams of type iib string theory compactied on
ads5  s5.
a number of bulk elds has been identied to correspond to the various gauge
invariant composite elds of n = 4 super yang-mills. we do not discuss this cor-
respondence in detail here. in the following we will just describe in some detail the
correspondence between the dilaton eld of type iib supergravity and the compos-
f a showing that the two-point
ite given by the yang-mills lagrangian f 2  f a
functions that one obtains from both eqs.(7.7) and (7.8) are coincident [39, 40].

since n = 4 super yang-mills theory with gauge group su(n) is a conformal
invariant quantum theory and the composite eld f 2 has dimension 4 the two-point
function involving two f 2 elds must have the following form:

< f 2(x)f 2(z) >

n 2

(~x  ~z)8

(7.9)

apart from an overall constant that we do not care to compute. the previous
correlator can also be obtained by using the lowest order perturbation theory in
n = 4 super yang-mills. ~x denotes here a minkowski four-vector.
in the bulk theory we only need the dilaton kinetic term in type iib supergravity
in d = 10 compactied on ads5 s5. taking into account that the volume of s5 is
equal to 3b5, where b is given in eq.(7.3), we need to consider the following action:

s =

(7.10)

where g = b2
given in eq.(5.20).
approximation, we just need to solve the dilaton eq. of motion given by:

z2  is the metric of ads5 in the so-called poincare coordinates
in the limit  >> 1, where classical supergravity is a good

 [gg] = 0

(7.11)

the solution of the previous equation, that is equal to 0 on the boundary (corre-
sponding to the limit z  0), can be given in terms of the greens function:

(z, ~x) = z d4~x k(z, ~x; ~y) 0(~z)

; k(z, ~x; ~y) 

z4

[z2 + (~x  ~y)2]4

(7.12)

inserting the solution found in eq.(7.12) in the classical action we get that the
contribution to the classical action is entirely due to the boundary term

s =

(7.13)

where we have introduced a cut o  at the lower limit of integration, that, however,
cancels out after having inserted eq.(7.12) in eq.(7.13). in conclusion in the classical
approximation ( >> 1) we get

z(0) = exp" 3b8

taking into account eq.(7.3) and that 22

tion we can get immediately the two-point function:

s()4, from the previous equa-

< f 2(x)f 2(z) >=

2z(0)

0(~x)0(~z) 

n 2

(~x  ~z)8

(7.15)

that agrees with the expression given in eq.(7.9). notice, however, that the super-
gravity approximation is in general only valid for large values of  (see eq.(7.6)),
while the previous example shows that it seems to be valid for any value of . this
is, of course, a consequence of the conformal invariance of n = 4 super yang-mills
that requires the vanishing of the contribution to the two-point function of all string
corrections to the supergravity action. the same result is also true if one computes
the three point function involving f 2 or the two and three-point functions involv-
ing the energy-momentum tensor. actually, using the value of 10 given just after
eq.(7.14) together with eq.(7.3), it is easy to see that the factor in front of the
einstein action or of the dilaton kinetic term is proportional to n 2 and does not
depend on the gauge coupling constant gy m . this means that the pure supergrav-
ity approximation will never give a dependence of the correlators of gauge theory
on the gauge coupling constant. in order to obtain the dependence on the gauge
coupling constant we need to add string corrections. let us restrict ourselves to
the pure gravity part of type iib supergravity. the action with the rst string
correction containing only the metric is given by:

(7.17)

the prime indicates that the term (n, m) = (0, 0) is excluded from the sum, 2 
im and  and  are respectively the dilaton and the r-r scalar of type iib
string. the function [41] f that is invariant under the sl(2, z) transformation
  (a + b)/(c + d), can be expanded for small values of e = gs getting

zm m 1/2he2im  + e2im i (1 + /m)

(7.18)

the rst term in the r.h.s. of the previous equation comes from the tree string
diagrams, the second from one-loop string corrections, while the rest is the contri-
bution of d instantons. if one now uses the action in eq.(7.16) to compute the two
and three-point function for the energy-momentum tensor of n = 4 super yang-
mills one nds that the extra term gives no contribution, because it identically

39

vanishes [42] when we compute it in the background ads5  s5. but instead it
gives a non trivial contribution to the four-point amplitude.
in particular, since
the four-point amplitude will include the function f , and since in the ads/cf t
correspondence the yang-mills coupling constant is related to the string coupling
constant through the relation: g2
y m = 4gs we immediately see from eq.(7.18) that
the d instanton contribution becomes the usual instanton contribution in yang-
mills theory [42]. this result is conrmed by explicit calculations in n = 4 super
yang-mills [43]. a quick way of xing the dependence on n and on the gauge cou-
pling constant of the two terms present in the action in eq.(7.16) is by remembering
that under a rescaling of the metric by b2 we get the following relations:

;

;

g  b10g

r4  b8r4

(7.19)

(7.20)

g  b2g

and

r  b2r

by the previous rescalings (where we have also taken into account that the inte-
gration over the sphere s5 gives an extra factor b5) we get that the coecient of
the einstein term in eq.(7.16) is proportional to n 2 as previously found, while the
coecient of the rst string correction in eq.(7.16) is proportional to n 2(ng2
y m )3/2
that depends explicitly on the gauge coupling constant.

we have seen that in the equivalence between n = 4 super yang-mills and type
iib string theory compactied on ads5  s5 the yang-mills action f 2 that has
conformal dimension equal to 4 corresponds to the massless dilaton. in ref. [40] it
has been shown that a massive scalar eld with mass equal to m corresponds in the
conformal eld theory to a composite operator with dimension  equal to

 = 2 + 4 + b2m2

(7.21)

here we will not derive this result whose derivation can be found in ref. [40], but
we will only derive eq.(7.21) in the limit of very large b m. let us consider a scalar
eld  of the bulk theory with mass m that corresponds to a composite eld f (x)
of the boundary theory with conformal dimension . the two-point function in
the boundary theory is xed apart from an overall normalization by the conformal
invariance of the theory. this means that:

< f (~x)f (~y) > [|~x  ~y|]2

(7.22)

where we have made the composite f (x) dimensionless by multiplying it with a
factor  ( is a parameter with dimension of a mass). on the other hand the
previous two-point function of the boundary theory is also equal to the two-point
function of the bulk theory involving the corresponding eld :

< f (~x)f (~y) >  < (~x)(~y) >

(7.23)

if the two points ~x and ~y are on the boundary of ads space, i.e. in minkowski four-
dimensional space. but the propagator of a free particle with mass m in the bulk

40

theory for m very large is given by the particle action computed along a geodesic
that connects the two points ~x and ~y. the action describing a particle moving in
ads space is given by:

s = mz qgdxdx

(7.24)

choosing for the ads metric the one given in eq.(5.20) and the two points of the
boundary to be at x = a we get:

s = mbz a

z vuut1 +  dz

the geodesic satises the equation:

dx!2
  dz

z (cid:19)2
= (cid:18)z0

(7.25)

(7.26)

where z0 is the minimum value taken by z. it is easy to see that the previous eq.
denes a circle with center on the boundary at x = 0 and with radius z0 = a, that
connects the two points on the boundary at x = a. when we insert the geodesic
solution in the original action we get:

s = 2mbz z0

(7.27)

where we have introduced an infrared cuto  in the bulk theory. by performing
the integral in the limit of small  we get:

< (a)(a) > es  e2mb log a/ = (cid:18)a

(cid:19)2mb

from eqs.(7.22), (7.23) and (7.28) we get for large values of the mass m:

  mb

(7.28)

(7.29)

that agrees with eq.(7.21) for b m >> 1. in addition by comparing eqs.(7.22) and
(7.28) we can see that the infrared cuto  of the bulk theory corresponds to an
ultraviolet cuto  = 1/ of the boundary theory [44].

8 finite temperature n = 4 super yang-mills

in the previous section we have briey seen how the maldacena conjecture provides
for the rst time a very strong evidence for the appearence of a string theory in a
non-perturbative gauge theory precisely realizing the ideas reviewed in sect. 2 on
the large n expansion in qcd and without running into the problem that a string

41

theory contains gravity while the gauge theory does not. on the other hand we
are immediately confronted with a new puzzle because n = 4 super yang-mills
is in the coulomb phase and therefore the emergence of a string has nothing to
do with the conning properties of the theory. in order to get a conning theory
we have to get rid of the conformal invariance of the theory. the simplest way for
doing so is by considering n = 4 super yang-mills at nite temperature. but, since
bosons have periodic and fermions anti-periodic boundary conditions, in going to
nite temperature, we also break supersymmetry. therefore at high temperature we
expect to reduce ourselves to a non-supersymmetric gauge theory that is presumably
in the same universality class as pure yang-mills theory in three dimensions and
that is conning.

in the previous section we have seen that n = 4 super yang-mills at zero
temperature is related to ads5 and it is therefore natural to expect that n = 4 super
yang-mills at nite temperature is related to the nite temperature version of ads5
discussed in ref. [8]. we will see that at nite temperature we need to consider, at
least for very large t hooft coupling where supergravity is a good approximation,
two classical solutions of the supergravity equations: the rst one is ads5 that we
had also at zero temperature and that is dominating at low temperature, while the
second one is the ads5 black hole that is instead dominating at high temperature.
the high temperature case is the most interesting one because in this case we get
connement and a mass gap.

in section 5 we have seen that anti de sitter space in euclidean uncompactied
space is described by eq.(5.12). we now want to compactify the coordinate v. let
us restrict ourselves to ads+
n+1 where both u, v > 0. the manifold in eq.(5.12) is
invariant under the action of a group that we call z and that acts on the coordinates
as follows:

u  1u

v  v

y  y

(8.1)

we can construct a compactied version of ads+
the group z. in this way one gets the manifold x1  ads+
domain for the action of z on v is the interval 1  v
a circle with natural coordinate

n+1 by modding out the action of
n+1/z. the fundamental
b  . therefore v parametrizes

v

0    2

(8.2)

the independent variables describing this compactied version of anti de sitter
space can be taken to be v and ~y, while u is given in terms of them through
eq.(5.12). the manifold x1 spanned by (v, ~y) is then topologically equivalent to
s1  rn. the boundary of x1 is instead topologically equivalent to s1  sn1. it
is convenient to perform the change of variables:

its boundary has the topology of s1  sn1.

x2 is topologically equivalent to r2  sn1 where r2 corresponds to the variables
(r, t).
in conclusion we have two
solutions of the classical eq.(5.2): the manifold x1 corresponding to adsn+1 with
a compactied coordinate having the topology of s1  rn and the manifold x2
corresponding to the anti de sitter black hole having the topology of r2  sn1.
their boundary has in both cases the topology of s1sn1 that is also the topology
of minkowski space with compactied time and space.

(8.10)

(8.11)

the metric in eq.(8.9) becomes a two-dimensional at metric in polar coordinates:

(ds2)x2 = dz2 + z2d2

(8.12)

there is no singularity if the variable  is periodic with period equal to 2. then
eq.(8.11) implies that t must also be a periodic variable with period equal to 0
given in eq.(8.8). if we plot 0 as a function of r+ we see that 0 is vanishing for

both r+ = 0 and  and has a maximum value equal to (4b)/(qn(n  2)) for
r+ = bq(n  2)/n. this means that 0 cannot be arbitrarily large and therefore

the temperature cannot be arbitrarily small. we will in fact see that this solution
is relevant for high temperature, while the other solution x1 is relevant at low
temperature. in order to see which one of the two solutions dominates we have to
compute their classical euclidean action. in both cases it is equal to:

iclass =

nvn+1
8gn b2

(8.13)

where vn+1 is a divergent volume. therefore the classical action is innite in both
cases. we compute their dierence by regularizing each of the contributions with a
radius r and by taking the two temperatures connected by the condition:

s1 +

r2

b2 0(x1) = s1 +

r2
b2 

wnm

(8.14)

that relates the two periods in a coordinate invariant way. therefore we have to
compute:

the previous integrals can be easily computed and in the limit of the cuto r  
we get a nite result:

is equal to the parameter m that corresponds to the mass of the black hole and
that the entropy

4gn

(8.18)

is in complete agreement with the beckenstein-hawking expression for the entropy
of a black hole given by the area of the horizon in (n  1) dimensions divided by

44

4gn . in particular, if we consider the case n = 3 and we take the anti de sitter
radius b   we get the metric of the schwarzschild black hole given by:

(ds2)s = (1

)dt2 +

dr2
(1  rg

(8.19)

where rg = w3m = 2gn m is the schwarzschild radius.

for both x1 and x2 the radii of the boundary (r  ) with the topology of

s1  sn1 are given by:
 =

r0
2b

 = r




=

0
2b

(8.20)

therefore in the decompactication limit in which the topology of s1sn1 becomes
that of s1rn1, i.e. the topology of minkowski space with periodic euclidean time,
we must take the high temperature limit 0  0. this limit can be obtained for
both r+  0 and r+  . we will see later on that actually the high temperature
phase corresponds to the case r+   because this branch is dominant with respect
to the other. in this limit corresponding also to the limit m  , as one can see
from eq.(8.17), we get:

r+ = (wnmb2)1/n

0 =

4b2
nr+

when r+   (m  ) it is convenient to introduce the new variables:

1/n

r = (cid:18)wnm
bn2 (cid:19)



t = (cid:18) wnm

bn2 (cid:19)1/n

(8.22)

(8.23)

notice that, when m  , the radius of sn1 becomes very large and the period
of the variable  becomes equal to (4b)/n.
both solutions x1 and x2 contribute to the partition function and correlators of
the gauge theory that in our case is n = 4 super yang-mills at nite temperature.
in general we have to sum over both of them:

ei  ei1 + ei2 = ei1h1 + eii = ei2h1 + eii

(8.24)

from eq.(8.16) we see that, when r+ is small, then i > 0 and therefore x1
dominates. this is the limit that describes the low temperature phase. when
instead r+   from the same eq. we see that i < 0 and therefore the solution
x2 is dominant at high temperature. one sees also that the branch at r+  

45

is dominant with respect to the one r+  0 because at r+  0 i2 = i1, while at
r+   i2 < i1.
following the maldacena conjecture we expect that n = 4 super yang-mills at
high temperature and for large t hooft coupling (  ) is described by the ads5
black hole. in order to check this let us compare the entropy of n = 4 super yang-
mills with that of ads5 black hole [45]. the entropy of the ads5 black hole can
be obtained from eq.(8.18) for n = 4. by rewriting it in terms of the temperature
related to r+ through eq.(8.21) (0 = 1/t ) and introducing v3 = 3b3 we get:

sbh =

2
2

v3t 3n 2

(8.25)

where we have used eq.(7.3) and the fact that the ve-dimensional newton constant
is equal to 16g(5)
s /(b55) with 5 = 3. the factor b55 is the
volume of s5.

n = (2)7()4g2

the entropy of n = 4 super yang-mills can be easily computed at weak coupling
where it can just be obtained by counting the bosonic and fermionic degrees of
freedom. in fact by taking into account that n = 4 super yang-mills theory has 8
bosonic and 8 fermionic massless degrees of freedom and that the entropy of each
bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom is given respectively by:

sbos =

n 2v3t 3

;

sf er =

we get the following entropy at weak coupling

n 2v3t 3

(8.26)

sy m =

3

n 2v3t 3

(8.27)

it is equal to the entropy of the black hole in eq.(8.25) apart from a numerical factor
(4/3). the mismatch between the two results can be easily explained from the fact
that one is valid for strong coupling while the other one is valid in perturbation
theory [46]. in general we expect the following behaviour of the entropy with the
yang-mills coupling constant [46]:

s(ng2

y m ) =

22
3

n 2v3t 3f (ng2

y m )

(8.28)

where f (x) is a smooth function that is equal to f (0) = 1 at weak coupling corre-
sponding to x = 0 and to f () = 3/4 at strong coupling. the inclusion of the rst
string correction [46] gives:

f (ng2

y m ) =

3
4

+

45
32

(3)(2g2

y m n)3/2

(8.29)

while a recent two-loop calculation [47] shows that its perturbative expansion is:

f (ng2

y m ) = 1 

3
22 g2

y m n

46

(8.30)

these results show that the function f is not a constant and are consistent with
f being a monotonic function interpolating between 1 at ng2
y m = 0 and 3/4 at
ng2

y m = .
in the second part of this section we consider n = 4 super yang-mills at high
temperature and we compute various physical quantities in this theory using its
correspondence with iib supergravity compactied on ads5  s5. as we have
explained in sect. 7 supergravity is a good approximation to n = 4 super yang-
mills in the strong coupling limit ng2
y m >> 1. in particular in the following we
will show that, by computing the wilson loop and nding that it is proportional
to the area, this theory connes. we will then look at the glue ball mass spectrum
and we will show that in the high temperature phase a mass gap is generated.

for computing the wilson loop it is convenient to use the following form of the

black hole metric:

where the variables used here are related to those used in eq.(8.23) for n = 4 by the
equations:

(8.32)

in eq.(8.31) we have also added the part of the metric corresponding to the sphere
s5. the variable u is the same as the one dened in eq.(7.1). in these new variables
the period of the periodic variable t is equal to:

 =

1
t

=

b2
ut

(8.33)

following refs. [37, 38] the rectangular wilson loop in the gauge theory can be
approximated in the strong coupling limit by the value of the minimal nambu-
goto string action. the string has the world sheet in anti de sitter space ending
on the rectangular wilson loop. the string action in anti de sitter space is given
by:

s =

1

2 z dz dqdet(gm n xm xn )

(8.34)

where gm n is the metric in eq.(8.31). the wilson loop is along the variables x1
and x2 and we choose the static gauge, where x2 =  and x1 = . the
nite temperature calculation has been carried out in refs. [48, 49]. for the sake of
simplicity we consider the case in which the world sheet of the string depends only
on the variable u where in particular u depends only on one of the world sheet
variables x1. in this case for the action in eq.(8.34) we get the following expression:

s =

where x  x1, x2 is the lenght of the temporal side of the rectangular wilson loop
and r is the distance between the test quarks. since the previous lagrangian
does not explicitly depend on x the corresponding hamiltonian is a constant of
motion:

 h =

(8.37)

introducing the minimum value of u, that we call u0, corresponding, because of
the symmetry of the problem, to x = 0, and that is the value for which eq.(8.37)
vanishes, we can determine the constant c in terms of u0:

integrating the dierential equation in (8.37) we get

since the two test quarks in the wilson loop are at a distance r in minkowski
space, that is the boundary of ads5 obtained by taking the limit u  , the value
x = r/2 in the l.h.s. of eq.(8.39) corresponds to u  . introducing the variable
w = u/u0 and taking this limit in the previous eq. we get:

and subtracting to it the self-energy of the two test quarks (umax  ut )/ corre-
sponding to the energy of two strings stretching up to the boundary of ads5. the
energy is now convergent and we can take the limit umax   obtaining

where we have used eq.(8.33). using eq.(7.4) we get nally:

(8.44)

(8.45)

in conclusion we have shown that the high temperature phase of n = 4 super
yang-mills is a conning one with string tension given in eq.(8.45).
in the following we discuss in some detail the fact that at nite temperature a
mass gap appears. the appearence of a mass gap is usually seen by studying the
two-point function involving for instance the composite f 2 and showing that its
large distance behaviour decays exponentially with the distance:

< f 2(x)f 2(0) > em|x|

(8.46)

from this behaviour one can just read the mass m of the lowest lying state that
has the same quantum numbers as f 2. this provides the mass gap of the theory.
we could just compute the mass gap from the correlator in eq.(8.46), but there is
a simpler way that we are going to discuss now following ref. [9]. if the maldacena
conjecture is right and therefore n = 4 super yang-mills is equivalent for large
values of  to type iib supergravity compactied on ads5  s5, then the hilbert
spaces of these two theories must be the same. we have seen in sect. 7 that the
composite and gauge invariant eld f 2 corresponds in supergravity to the dilaton
eld . in order to construct the hilbert space in the supergravity approximation,
that is relevant for constructing the two-point function involving for instance two
elds f 2 we have to consider the classical equation of motion of the dilaton, that
is the eld corresponding to f 2, in the ads5  s5 background and search for its
solutions satisfying certain boundary conditions. since the dilaton is massless in
ten dimensions, the  = 0 mode on s5 is also massless in ve dimensions. this
mode does not depend on the coordinates of s5 and satises the classical equation:

 [gg] = 0

(8.47)

where g is the metric of ads5 that is given in eq.(8.23) for n = 4. we wish to
look at solutions of the previous equation that are square integrable in the previous

49

metric and that correspond to plane waves in the boundary gauge theory, i.e. we
take the dilaton in eq.(8.47) to be of the following form:

(, x) = f () eikx

(8.48)

following the procedure discussed in great detail in ref. [12] it is convenient to
rescale  by  = b2 . the period of  is equal to /b and after a rescaling of the
variables xi the metric becomes:

ds2
b2 = (2 

b4
2 )d 2 +

d2
2  b4

2

+ 2

3

xi=1

(dxi)2 + d2
5

(8.49)

inserting the previous metric in the dilaton equation with a dilaton eld given in
eq.(8.48) we get:

1


h(cid:16)4  b4(cid:17) fi = k2f

introducing the quantity x = 2 and rescaling x by x  b2x we get the following
equation:

d2f
dx2 + (3x2  1)

df
dx

x(x2  1)

(8.51)
rescaling k  b2k in order to have a quantity with the dimension of a mass we
get that in terms of the rescaled variable the coecient of the non-derivative term
in eq.(8.51) becomes k2b2/4. as a boundary condition we need to impose that the
solution be square integrable. this means that it must satisfy the condition:

=

k2
4b2 f

(8.50)

(8.52)

z dg|f ()|2 < 

since gd = 3d = 1
near the horizon the metric in eq.(8.49) behaves after a rescaling of  as:

2xdx the previous condition implies that f  xa with a > 1.

ds2  (cid:18)x 

1

x(cid:19) (d )2 +

dx2

4(x2  1)

we introduce the variable z related to x through the relation:

dz =

dx

2x2  1

(8.53)

(8.54)

that implies x = cosh(2z). the coordinate singularity appearing in the metric in
eq.(8.53) at x = 1 corresponds in the new variable to z = 0. then since near the
horizon

1
x

x 

=

sinh2 2z
cosh 2z  4z2

(8.55)

the metric in eq.(8.53), in the near horizon limit, becomes the two-dimensional at
metric in polar coordinates

ds2 = dz2 + 4z2d 2

(8.56)

50

since the function f () is only a function of the radial variable z and not of the
angular variable  a proper boundary condition for f is that it is smooth at the
origin, i.e. df

dz = 0 at z = 0. but, since

df
dz

=

dx
dz

df
dx

= 2 sinh 2z

df
dx  4z

df

(8.57)

one gets that the function f must be regular at the horizon x = 1. in conclusion
we must look for square integrable solutions of the dilaton classical equation in
eq.(8.51) that are regular at the horizon. we can rewrite the dierential equation
in (8.51) as follows:

y +(cid:20) 1

x

+

1

x + 1

+

1

x  1(cid:21) y =

x(x2  1)

y

(8.58)

where f = y. the eigenvalues of eq.(8.58) has been determined numerically in
refs. [50, 51, 52]. in the following we describe the method proposed in ref. [52] in
order to show that the spectrum of the eigenvalues of the dierential equation in
(8.58) is discrete and in particular that there is a mass gap. the general solution of
the previous eq. can always be written as a linear combination of two independent
solutions that in general have singularities at x = 0, 1 and . therefore in general
a solution cannot be represented as a convergent series expansion throughout the
entire physical region 1  x  . it is possible, however, to consider expansions
that are convergent in either of the two intervals i()  {xc|1 < x < } and
i(1)  {xc|0 < x < 2}. they overlap in the interval 1 < x < 2.
in the rst
interval i() following ref. [52] the most general solution can be witten in terms
of the two convergent expansions:

and

(8.59)

(8.60)

while in the interval i(1) can be written in terms of the following two other conver-
gent series:

y(1)
1 = 1 +

a(1)
n (x  1)n



xn=1

(8.61)

(8.62)

and

y(1)
2 = log(x  1)y(1)

1 +



xn=1

b(1)
n (x  1)n

the expansion coecients can be determined for any value of p by recursion from the
dierential eq.(8.58). in general, however, the previous solutions or any combination
of them will not satisfy both boundary conditions that we have discussed above. for

51

certain values of p it turns out that there exists a solution that is simultaneously
proportional to y()
1 . the condition for this to happen is that their
wronskian vanishes:

and to y(1)

w (p, x)  


y(1)

dy(1)

dx

y()

(8.63)

for 1 < x < 2 both series are convergent and the wronskian can be computed and
can be seen to have the following form:

w (p, x) =

r(p)

x(x  1)(x + 1)

(8.64)

the function r(p) can also be computed to any desired accuracy. the spectrum
of p is determined by the zeroes of r(p). it can be seen that there is no positive
or zero eigenvalue of the dierential equation in eq.(8.58). therefore a mass gap is
generated together with a discrete spectrum. in particular the eigenvalue spectrum
can be approximately computed using the wkb approximation and one gets [50,
53]:

m 2 = k2 = 8 [(3/4)]4 t 2n(n + 1)

(8.65)

where n is an arbitrary positive integer.

in this section we have studied the behaviour of n = 4 super yang-mills at high
temperature. remembering that nite temperature means that one direction (the
euclidean time one) is compactied along a circle of radius equal to 1/(2t ), then
the radius becomes very small at high temperature. this means that at high tem-
perature the theory becomes eectively three-dimensional and therefore studying
the original four-dimensional theory at high temperature corresponds essentially to
study a three-dimensional theory in which supersymmetry is broken and in which
we expect that both the fermions and scalars get a mass of the order of the tem-
perature. because of this it is then natural to think that this theory reduces to a
theory of pure yang-mills in three dimensions. the relation between the four and
the three-dimensional coupling constants can be found by expanding the d 3-brane
eective born-infeld action and keeping only the kinetic term for the gauge eld
as we have done in eq.(1.10). in this way for p = 3 one gets the yang-mills action
in four dimensions with g2
y m 4 = 4gs. then remembering that the time direction
is compactied with radius equal to 1/(2t ) we get the yang-mills action in three
dimensions with coupling constant equal to:

g2
y m 3 = g2

y m 4t

(8.66)

we have seen that the use of the supergravity approximation is allowed only in the
strong coupling limit where ng2
y m 4   >> 1, while the three-dimensional yang-
mills scale ng2
y m 4  0. in
order to study this limit we have to go away from the supergravity approximation
and take into account the tree diagrams of string theory. but this is unfortunately
beyond our reach at present.

y m 3 is obtained in the limit in which t   and ng2

9 d = 4 yang-mills from the m-theory 5-brane

in the previous section we have seen how, starting from the ten-dimensional non
extremal d 3-brane, one can describe strongly coupled n = 4 super yang-mills
at high temperature or alternatively a theory that is presumably in the same uni-
versality class of three-dimensional yang-mills theory. in this section we discuss
a suggestion, made by witten [9], on how to extend the previous procedure from
three to four-dimensional yang-mills theory. the starting point in this case is not
the d 3-brane of the ten-dimensional type iib string theory, but the 5-brane of the
eleven-dimensional m-theory. this solution has in the near horizon limit a metric
corresponding to the manifold ads7  s4 with the two radii given by:
= p(n)1/3

(9.1)

rads7  b = 2p(n)1/3

rs4  l =

where the 11-dimensional planck lenght p is related to the 11-dimensional grav-
itational constant by 22
p. following the notation of ref. [54] the 11-

by:

(9.4)

if we compactify one the 11 dimensions belonging to the world volume of the m5-
brane we obtain a 10-dimensional theory in which the original m 5-brane becomes
the d 4-brane of type iia string theory. the dilaton and the 10-dimensional metric
of the d 4-brane can be obtained using the formula:

(ds11)2 = e4/3(cid:16)dx5 + adx(cid:17)2

+ e2/3(ds10)2

(9.5)

where what is usually called the 11th dimension is here the 5th direction.

comparing eq.(9.5) with the 11-th dimensional metric in eq.(9.2) we get that

the dilaton is given by:

e = gs(cid:18) y

l(cid:19)3/2

notice that the dependence on the string coupling constant in the second term of
the previous equation disappears in the third term because we use variables that
are 10-dimensional. both l and y0 in eq.(9.7) are now expressed in 10-dimensional
units. remembering that a lenght l(10) in 10-dimensional units is related to a
lenght l(11) in 11-dimensional ones through the formula : l(10) = g1/3
s l(11) we get
that the quantity l in eq.(9.7) is given by:

remember also that 22
s. we keep in the born-infeld
action only the gauge eld and the zero component of the 1-form potential. then
using the formulas given in eq.(9.11) and compactifying the time (temperature)

2(cid:17) =

(9.13)

keeping only the time component of the r-r eld a and expanding the born-infeld

using the equation:

and introducing a parameter  through the equation:

from eq.(9.17) we can read the value of the yang-mills coupling constant and
connect it with the radius r(10)

get:

(9.18)

(9.19)

to summarize we started with the m-theory 5-brane having a six-dimensional world
volume. we have then compactied two of the six directions on two radii. the rst
one, that we called r1, corresponds in going from the 11-dimensional m-theory
to the 10-dimensional type iia string theory and because of this compactication
the m-theory 5-brane becomes the 10-dimensional d 4-brane of type iia theory.
the second radius r2 that from the point of view of the 5-dimensional theory,
corresponding to the world volume of the d 4-brane, is related to the temperature
which is also the temperature of the non-extremal black hole solution, has been
introduced in order to reduce ourselves to a 4-dimensional theory gauge theory
that we are interested to study. in particular in the temperature direction we are
free to choose antiperiodic boundary conditions for the fermions of the theory and
correspondently they will have masses equal to (2n + 1)/r2 (n is an integer) that
become very big in the high temperature limit (r2  0). also the scalars of the

55

theory will get a mass of the order g2
y m /r2 and they will also become very massive
in the high temperature limit. therefore in this limit we will be left with only the
gauge eld and it looks plausible that such a theory is in the same universality class
as pure yang-mills theory.

in the second part of this section we will show how to compute various observ-
ables as for instance the wilson loop [49] and the topological susceptibility [54] in
the previously dened four-dimensional theory. let us start computing the topo-
logical susceptibility.
in eq.(9.17) we see that the yang-mills topological charge
density is coupled to the time component gsa0  h of the r-r eld a:

h  o4 =

n
2 

1
8

t r (ff)

(9.20)

where , ,  and  are all four-dimensional indices. therefore in order to compute
correlators involving the topological charge density as for instance the topological
susceptibility, that is related to the two-point function with two operators o4, we
must look at the classical eq. of motion for a0 that follows from the type iia
supergravity lagrangian. the relevant term of the type iia supergravity is the
kinetic term for a, namely

2((0)

10 )2 z d10xg

gg00a0a0

(9.21)

the function h  gsa0 is determined by solving the classical eq. that follows from
the previous action:
(9.22)

hgg00ghi = 0

we can assume that h is only a function of y. in fact, since we will see that the
contribution to the various correlators comes from a boundary term, the dependence
on the other variables will be irrelevant because they will never contribute to a
total divergence. remembering that the background metric following from eq.(9.7)
is given by:

y!3
g00 =   l

1

y0(cid:17)6
1 (cid:16) y

gyy =

we get the following eq. of motion:

y

4l 
1   y

y0!6


l(cid:19)9
g = 2(cid:18) y

(9.23)

y"(cid:18) y
l(cid:19)7

yh# = 0

(9.24)

integrating it with the two boundary conditions:

h(y) = h

lim
y

h(y0) = 0

(9.25)

56

we obtain the following solution [55, 54]:

h(y) = h

y !6
1   y0


(9.26)

when we insert it in the action in eq.(9.21) we are left with only a surface term
that cannot be neglected and is equal to:

sclass. =

1
22

10 z d10xy"g
10 z d4l4z d4xz dt g

2

gyyg00hyh# =
g00gyy! hyh|

2

=

22

using eqs.(9.23) and (9.26) we get:

hyh| = 6(h)2 y6

y7

1
2

ggyyg00| =

1

l(cid:19)7
4 (cid:18) y

(9.27)

(9.28)

inserting them in eq.(9.27) we see that the dependence on y cancels out and we get

sclass. =

using the following expressions

(h)2 3y6

2l7 z d4l4z d4xz dt

z d4 =

z d4x  v4

z dt =

eq.(9.29) becomes

sclass. = v4

(h)2

(9.29)

(9.30)

(9.31)

the correlator involving two operators o4 is obtained by dierentiating twice esclass.
with respect to h and eliminating the volume factor. we get:

z d4x < o4(x) o4(0) >=

(9.32)

where we have used eqs.(9.4) and the relation 2
eq.(9.16). finally the topological susceptibility is given by [54]:

10 = 2

11nt / that follows from

t  z d4x  

2n!2 1

< o4(x) o4(0) >=

36

(9.33)

we can use the previous results to determine the behaviour of the vacuum energy of
a gauge theory in terms of the vacuum  parameter. in particular in the supergravity

57

approximation one can show [55] that the vacuum energy behaves precisely as given
in eq.(4.41) according to the large n considerations discussed in sect. 4. we have
seen above that the born-infeld action gives a term of the following form (see
eq.(9.14)):

zv

a  t r (f  f )

(9.34)

where v = s1  r4. the previous equation implies that we can introduce a 
parameter in the four-dimensional gauge theory by requiring that the integral of
the abelian vector eld a along the compactied direction be nonzero and equal to

a =  + 2k

zs1

(9.35)

where a is the value of the abelian vector eld in minkowski space corresponding
to the limit y   and we have taken care of the fact that  is an angular variable
by extracting from it the factor 2k. the vacuum energy of the four-dimensional
gauge theory can then be computed by proceeding exactly as in the calculation of
the topological susceptibility and obtaining:

e() =

t
2

mink( + 2k)2

(9.36)

in perfect agreement with eq.(4.40) obtained in the framework of the large n ex-
pansion after having used eq.(4.31).

we now turn our attention to the wilson loop, we show that it is proportional
to the area and from it we extract the string tension. the calculation is very
similar to the one we have done in sect. 8 for n = 4 super yang-mills at nite
temperature. one starts with the string action in eq.(8.34) in the metric given in
eq.(9.7). choosing the static gauge where x1  x = , x2 =  , assuming

that only the anti de sitter variable y is a function of x and remembering that (see
eq.(9.7) ):

l(cid:19)3
gxx = gx2x2 = (cid:18) y

gyy =

4l

we get the following expression for the string action:

s =

(9.40)

where u0 is the minimum value of u corresponding to c 2 = (u0)3/l6. since for
symmetry reason u = u0 corresponds to x = 0 by integrating the previous equation
we get:

x =

u0

l  l2

u0!3/2

z u/u0

(cid:20)(w3  1)(cid:18)w3 (cid:16) y2

u0(cid:17)3(cid:19)(cid:21)1/2

(9.41)

where we have introduced the variable w = u/u0.
corresponding to sending u   and correspondently x  r/2 we get:

if we go to the boundary,

r

u0(cid:17)3(cid:19)(cid:21)1/2

(9.42)

analogously we can compute the energy corresponding to the minimal surface that
is given by:

e

=

l z 

1

dw

w3

r(w3  1)(w4 (cid:16) y2
u0(cid:17)3

(9.43)

)

also in this case the energy is divergent. it can be regularized by cutting o the
integral at umax/u0 and subtracting the quantity (umax  ut )/(l) where ut 
y2
0. with the previous subtraction the integral in eq.(9.43) becomes convergent and
one can integrate up to innity getting:

e =

u0

l z

w3

r(w3  1)(w3 (cid:16) y2
u0(cid:17)3

ut  u0

(9.44)

in conclusion we arrive at the two equations:

r =

r(w3  1)(w3 (cid:16) y2

and

e =

l z

dw


)

ut  u0
l

(9.45)

(9.46)

59

from eq.(9.45) we see that when r   then u0  ut . on the other hand
eq.(9.46) can be rewritten in the form:

e =

u0

l z

then for large r we get a conning potential with string tension given by:

e
r   =

(9.48)

using the rst eq. in (9.4), eq.(9.8), the rst eq. in (9.18) and eq.(9.16) we arrive
at:

in this section we have described wittens proposal for studying yang-mills the-
ory starting from the m-theory 5-brane. in particular we have computed several
observables in the strong coupling limit of the gauge theory where the supergrav-
ity approximation can be applied. in order to understand large n gauge theories
one would like, however, to continue the previous results from strong to weak cou-
pling and to show that there is no other singularity except the one obtained when
ng2
y m  0, where we expect to recover the asymptotic freedom behaviour of gauge
theories for the various observables. this is, however, at the moment a dicult
problem to solve and some new idea seems to be needed.
