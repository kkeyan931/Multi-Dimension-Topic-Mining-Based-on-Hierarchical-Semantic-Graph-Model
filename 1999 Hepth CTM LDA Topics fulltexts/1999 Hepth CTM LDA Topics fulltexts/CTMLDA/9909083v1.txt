i review a recent progress towards solution of the almost mathieu equation (a.g. abanov, j.c.
talstra, p.b. wiegmann, nucl. phys. b 525, 571 ,1998), known also as harpers equation or azbel-
hofstadter problem. the spectrum of this equation is known to be a pure singular continuum with
a rich hierarchical structure. few years ago it has been found that the almost mathieu operator is
integrable. an asymptotic solution of this operator became possible due analysis the bethe ansatz
equations.

introduction in this lecture i review a recent
progress [1] towards decoding of one of the most puzzling
strange set generated by a quasiperiodic schrodinger op-
erator :

n+1 + n1 + 2 cos( + 2n)n = en

(1)

the history of this equation as well as its applications in
dierent branches of physics and mathematics are rich.
this equation, known as harpers equation, describes
the electronic spectrum of one-dimensional quasicrystal
(a particle in a quasiperiodic potential) and often used
to study localization-delocalization transition (see e.g.
[2,3]).
it also describes a bloch particle in a uniform
magnetic eld and also known as azbel-hofstadter prob-
lem [4,5]. it is a standard example of the operator, also
known as almost mathieu operator with a singular con-
tinuum spectrum [6,7]. this list may be continued.

the spectrum of this equation is complex. in the com-

mensurate case, when  is a rational number

 = p/q,

one may impose the bloch condition:

n = eik

n+q

then, the spectrum consists of q bands, separated by
q  1 gaps. in the incommensurate limit, when  is an
irrational number (p  , q  ) the spectrum be-
comes an innite cantor set [4,6] with total bandwidth
(lebesgue measure of the spectrum) 4|  1| [2,8,9].

the most interesting critical case appears at || = 1.
then the spectrum becomes a purely singular continuum

although some properties of the spectrum depend on the
type of irrational number , here we consider typically dio-
phantine numbers. these numbers have a full lebesgue mea-
sure and thus sucient for almost all physical applications.
closed, nowhere dense set with no isolated points

[7]. in this case wave functions lost their extended char-
acter and not yet localized but exhibit a power law scal-
ing. moreover, there is numerical evidence and almost
a consensus, that in this case ( = 1) the spectrum and
wave functions are multifractal [10].

multifractal sets exhibit a sort of conformal invariance
and are expected to be described by methods of confor-
mal eld theory. this theory, however, is yet to be devel-
oped and scaling properties of sets generated by dynam-
ical systems and by closely related quasiperiodic systems
are far from being understood.

since the empirical observations of hofstadter [5], the
evidence has been mounting that the spectrum of (1)
(hofstadter buttery) as well as other quasiperiodic equa-
tions with a dierential potentials are regular and univer-
sal rather than erratic or chaotic. few years ago it has
been shown [1114] that despite the complexity of the
spectrum, the harper-azbel-hofstadter-almost mathieu
operator (1) equation at any rational  = p/q is in-
tegrable and can be solved by employing methods of
integrable systems ansatz (ba). this had opened the
possibility of describing the complex behavior of an in-
commensurate system as a limit of a sequence of inte-
grable models. i hope that this solution will help to apply
conformal eld theory to dynamical systems.

the symmetries of the problem which eventually lead
to its integrability are the most transparent it its mag-
netic interpretation. consider a particle on a two di-
mensional square lattice in a magnetic eld with a ux
 = 2 per plaquette. its hamiltonian is:

h = tx + t 1

x + (ty + t 1

y

),

where operators tx and ty describe translations of the
particle in x and y direction by a lattice site. in magnetic
eld translations form a weyl pair:

txty = q2tytx,

(2)

where

q2 = ei.

the harpers equation, then appears as a result of rep-
resentation of translation operators as a shift and multi-
plication:

txn = n+1,
tyn = q2eikn

(3)

2. hierarchical tree.

i begin by describing the scal-
ing hypothesis for the spectrum of an incommensurate
(quasiperiodic) operator with a purely singular contin-
uum spectrum. to do so, we need a notion of the hierar-
chical tree.

let us consider a sequence of rational approximants
(j) = pj/qj with increasing qj to an irrational ux 
so that: |(j)  | < c(qj)2, where c is a j-independent
constant. a harper equation taken for each (j) is gen-
erations of the hierarchy. let us consider a graph (with
no loop), which connects the k-th band of the genera-
tion j (the daughter generation) to a certain band k of
some previous (parent) generation (j1). we call it a hi-
erarchical tree if energies ej(j ) belonging to any branch
j of the tree form a sequence converging to the point
e(j ) of the spectrum in such a way that the sequence
q2j |ej (j )  e(j )| is bounded but does not converge
to zero.

the set of numbers j are anomalous exponents. in a
multifractal spectrum, anomalous dimensions depend on
the branch. they and the tree characterize ultrametric
properties of the spectrum.

let us stress that the very existence of the hierarchical
tree is a hypothesis and the tree constructed below is the
conjecture. we call it scaling hypothesis.

to construct the hierarchical tree it is necessary to nd
the sequence of generations and a rule to determine the
parent generation and a parent band out of a given band
of a given generation. in other words, the hierarchical
tree is determined by a sequence of rational approximants
(j)   and by a mapping

(k, p, q)  (k, p , q).

(4)

where k and k are labels of a daughters band and the
parents band of generations p/q and p /q respectively.
to describe the hierarchical tree we will need a notion of
a discrete spectral ow and its rate hall conductance.

a heuristic denition of the spectral ow is as follows.
let us consider a spectrum of the problem with a given 
and choose some (big) gap. we label it by k. now let us
change  by a small , such that newly appeared gaps
in the vicinity of the edge of the big gap, will be smaller
than the big gap k. then we can look on new levels

this sequence always exists and can be constructed e.g.
from the farey series [15]

appeared within the big gap, close to the bottom of the
gap. the number of these levels, i.e., the number of levels
nk, crossing an energy e, lying inside the gap, close to
its lower edge, is a spectral ow. one can also treat the
spectral ow as a number of levels appeared within a
big band adjacent to the gap from below. the rate of
the spectral ow is

k =

nk


.

(5)

is known to be the hall conductance of the gap [16]
(stredas formula) of two dimensional particles in mag-
netic eld. this number is an integer and depends on
the gap. the dierence between the hall conductances
of nearest gaps, i.e., the spectral ow into the k-th band

(k) = k  k+1

(6)

is the hall conductance of the band.

the index theorem identies the hall conductance of
the band with the number of zeros of the wave function
n(k, k) within the brillouin zone: 0 < k < 2, 0 < k <
2/q, i.e., with the chern class of a band:

(k) =

1

2 ib

~ ln n(k, k)d~k,

where the integral goes over the boundary of the mag-
netic brillouin zone of the k th band.

the hall conductivity of the k-th gap varies the range
q/2 < k  q/2 and obeys the diophantine equation
[17,18]

p k = k (mod q).

(7)

in it turns the hall conductance of a band (k) is allowed
to have only two values. they can be found explicitly.
let us consider a continued fraction expansion of

(j) =

n1 +

1

1

n2+ 1

n3+...

 [n1, n2, n3, . . . , nj]

(8)

then the hall conductance of the gap k is

k =

qj
2

 qj(cid:26)(1)j qj1

qj

k +

1

2(cid:27) ,

(9)

while the two values of the hall conductance of the band
k may be

(k) = (1)j1qj1,

or

(1)j(qj  qj1)

(10)

here {x} is fractional part of x.

now let us turn to the hierarchical tree. we conjecture
that the hierarchical tree is the spectral hierarchy - an in-
tegral version of the spectral ow. let us consider two
close rational p/q and p /q with q < q. the number

2

of states per lattice site in a band is 1/q and 1/q re-
spectively. if there is a band k of the problem with a ux
p/q, such that its hall conductance is a ratio between
the dierence of the number of states and the uxes

1
q



1
q

= (k)(

p
q



p 
q

)

(11)

then we say that the band k of the generation p/q has
a parent band in the generation p /q. the absolute
value of the hall conductance is the dierence between
number of states in the parent and a daughter band:

q  q = |(k)|

(12)

this formula may be viewed as an integrated streda
it determines the ux p /q and and by
formula (5).
virtue of an iterative procedure, generates a sequence
of rational approximants (generations of the hierarchical
tree), (j) to .

the integrated streda formula is not enough to deter-
mine the tree. we complete it by the adiabatic prin-
ciple, which states that the levels do not cross each
other along a tree. this proposition may be put in
symbols. let us enumerate all states from the bottom
of the spectrum and characterize them by a fraction
 = (number of the state)/q. all states in the k-th band
have the fraction (k  1)/q <  < k/q. the adiabatic
principal assumes that a state in the middle of the band
k with a fraction (k  1/2)/q has a parent somewhere in
the parent band k, i.e.

(k  1)/q < (k  1/2)/q < k/q.

(13)

this together with integrated streda formula (11) and
formulas for the hall conductance (6,7,10) determines the
mapping (6) and thus the hierarchical tree. for quadratic
irrationals this algorithm allows to nd the tree analyti-
cally. i do not concentrate here on this matter, but would
like to make two comments:

intermediate fractions. rational approximants (gener-
ations of the tree), generated by this procedure, appeared
to be dier from truncated continues fraction of . they
are:

(j1) =(cid:26) [n1, n2, . . . , nj  1] ,
[n1, n2, . . . , nj1] ,

if (k) = (1)j1qj1
if (k) = (1)j(qj  qj1)

(14)

thus the parent generation is obtained by either sub-
tracting 1 from the last quotient nj of the continued
fraction or by truncating the fraction. the sequence of
generations produced by these iterations is known as in-
termediate fractions. the golden mean  =
is the
only number which rational approximants are truncated
continues fraction.

these numbers (denominators of intermediate frac-
tions) are known in integrable models related to uq(sl2)
as takahashi-suzuki numbers [19]. they are allowed
lengths of string solutions of bethe-ansatz equations.
these numbers are also a set of possible dimensions of ir-
reducible highest weight representations of uq(sl2) with
denite parity [20].

each path of the tree may also be characterized by a
fraction (j)
k = k/qj lying on the path and converged
to a given irrational fraction . according to eq.(13)
the parent fraction is determined by the daughter one
as (j1) = 1
qj  |(k)|. the sequence (j) converges to the irrational
 faster than q1
. in terms of the
fractions one may reformulate the scaling hypothesis as
|ej  e| < c|(j)  |(j ), dening the scaling exponent
(j ).

the hierarchical tree, we just described, has been sug-
gested by the bethe ansatz equations for the harpers
equation. however, it seems plausible that the construc-
tion is universal and valid for a general quasiperiodic
equation, regardless, whether it is integrable or not. a
set of hall conductances is the only input of the algo-
rithm.

3.

integrability. the harpers equation (1) is inte-
grable as soon as  is a rational. here i adopt a restricted
denition of the integrability of a linear eqaution: there
is an isospectral transformation which turns all bloch so-
lutions of the harpers equation to discrete polynomials
of degree q. in symbols

n = eikn

xm=0

cnmm,

(16)

where cnm is a unitary q  q matrix and (z) is a poly-
nomial of the degree q  1. in other words, there is a
gauge (a choice of the gage potential), or a representa-
tion of the algebra of translations in a magnetic eld (2),
where all wave functions are polynomials.

in this sence the harpers equation appears to be in-
tegrable for any point of the brillouin zone 0  k <
2/q, 0  k < 2 [12], although the bethe ansatz
equations look especially simple at the so called ratio-
nal points of the brillouin zone. the latter correspond
to the centers and edges of bands. the study of these
points is sucient for our purposes. in this case

takahashi-suzuki numbers. the entire set of hall con-
ductances generated by the ux p/q are numbers less
than q of the form

where aj do not depend on n and  is a constant.

it appears to be convenient to parameterized polyno-

mials by its roots:

(24)

below we sketch the results of the bethe-ansatz solu-
tion and skip all aspects of integrability related to cyclic
representations of uq(sl2) [21].

rational points form a zoo. to characterize them we
introduce parameters , ,  = 1. the choice  = 1
yields levels at the center of bands, while  = 1 corre-
sponds to edges of bands. the chambers relation

(k, k)  deth = 2 cos qk + 2 cos qk

(18)

implies that the energy depends on k and k via (k, k).
therefore the edges of the energy bands are given by ex-
trema of  which assumes a minimum/maximum given
by  = (2 + 2). the middle of bands corresponds to
 = 0. if p is even (q is odd) the rational points are la-
beled by additional discrete parameters ,  = 1. the
middle points of bands at  = 1 are given by the equa-

where one suppose to set z = qn. however, there is a
certain advantage to consider the dierence equation for
(z) in a complex plane z.

the integrability now reads: all bloch solutions of the

dierence equation (20) are polynomials.

i try to unmasked this transformation by a comment
bellow, however it becomes meaningful in the uq(sl2)
setup.

let us represent translation operators (3) by another

weyl pair

and setting

u v = qv u,

(21)

equation (20) appears, by choosing a standard represen-
tation of u and v :

(u )n = 1qnn, (v )n = i n+1.

4. the bethe ansatz. being sure that solutions of the
eq.(20) are polynomials, we may evaluate it at one of the
roots of the polynomial zi. this gives the bethe-ansatz
(ba) equations:

the harper equation at bands edges and centers. their

the latter is obtained by evaluating the leading terms at
z   at eq.(20).

at rst glance, the ba equations (25) look even more
complicated than the original harper equation. this is
true as long as q is not large. however, the ba equations
(25) provide a better description of the problem in the
most interesting, incommensurate, limit p, q  ,  
irrational number.

at p odd the ba equations admit an exact zero mode
solution at for e = 0 [22]. for a quasiclassical analysis
of the ba equations at   0, see [23].

below, we consider the most interesting case  = 1.
3. string hypothesis. here we formulate the string
hypothesis which allows us to obtain the solutions of the
ba equations (at  = 1) with an accuracy o(q2). the
hypothesis is based on the analysis of singularities of the
ba, and is supported by extensive numerics [1]. here
we just formulate the string hypothesis and present some
immediate consequences. to proceed, we need the notion
of strings.

a string of spin l, parity v=  1 and center xl is a set

of 2l + 1 complex numbers:

z(l)
m = vlxlqm

l , m = l, l + 1. . . . , l.

(27)

which have a common modulus xl > 0 (a center of the
string), a parity vl = 1 and dier by multiples of ql.

now we are ready to formulate the string hypothesis

 a central concept of this analysis:

 at large q each solution of the ba consists of

strings.

total number of roots pk

 each solution can be labeled by spins {lj, lj1, . . .}
and parities {vj, vj1, . . .} of strings, such that the
i=1(2li + 1) = q  1. we
refer to the set of lengths and parities of strings
constituting the solution for a given energy level as
to a string content of this level. not more than
two strings with a given length and parity may be
found in a string content of the solution.

 the length of the longest string in a string content
of a given energy level is the hall conductance of the
corresponding band: 2l + 1 = |(k)|. the period of
this string ql = eil is uniquely determined by the
requirement that l = pl
2l+1 is the best approximant
for the period , so that q2l+1

= 1.

l

 the parity of the longest string is vl = iql+1/2

 =
(1)[l]. the center of the longest string is xl =
1 + o(1/l).

l

 the remaining roots of the state is a solution of
the ba equation for the parent state of the parent
generation.

the string hypothesis states that

daugther(z) 

l

ym=l

(z  xlvlqm

l )parent(z).

(28)

and that 2l + 1 = |(k)| is the absolute value of the hall
conductance of the daughter band.

this simple hypothesis allows one to construct a com-
plete set of wave functions by virtue of the iterative pro-
cedure:

starting from an irrational , we rst generate a hier-
archical tree. let us choose a branch of the tree j. find
the hall conductance of the bands belong to the branch
down to the origin. this determines the lengths, periods
and parities of the string content and therefore zeros of
the wave function of the chosen branch.

the only unknowns are the centers of strings. they,
however approach 1 with accuracy o(1/l). the accuracy
of the recursive eq.(28) is o(l2). the string content of a
state (i.e., lengths and parities of strings) is a topological
characteristics, while the centers of strings are not.

the strings hierarchy has been obtained by analysis of
singularities of ba (see [1]). as it was expected a set of
possible lengths of strings is a set of takahashi-suzuki
numbers, known in the bethe- ansatz literature. eq.(7)
provides a relation between them and hall conductances.
to illustrate the iterative procedure let us consider the
bottom edges of the lowest band of the spectrum and
to be the golden mean. the sequence
choose  =
of rational approximants is given by ratios of subsequent

51

2

fibonacci numbers i = fi1
, where the fi are fibonacci
fi
numbers (fi = fi2 + fi1 and f0 = f1 = 1). the
set of hall conductances = takahashi-suzuki numbers =
allowed lengths of strings are again fibonacci numbers:
qk1 = fk1. the considered branch of hierarchical tree
connects edges ( = 1,  = 1,  = 1) of the lowest bands
of generations 3k = f3k1/f3k. their string content
consists of pairs of strings with length 2ln + 1 = f3n+1,
n = 0, 1, . . . , k  1, parities +1 and inverted centers xk
and x1
k . according to the string hypothesis the wave
function of this state is

(z|3k) 

k1

yn=0

ln

yj=ln

(z  xln qj

)(z  x1

).

(29)

centers of the strings xln are close to 1 but can not be
obtained from the string hypothesis alone.

5. gaps. a direct application of the string hypothesis,
suggested by j. bellissard, is the calculation of the gap
distribution (d), i.e., the number of gaps with magni-
tude between d and d+dd. the result is (d)  d3/2,
which essentially means that the width of the smallest
gaps scales as dmin  1/q2. this result conrms nu-
merical analysis of ref. [24].

i.e.,

6. scaling hypothesis and nite size corrections: stat-
ing the problem. the string hypothesis solves the bethe
ansatz equations with an accuracy o(q2),
is
asymptotically exact in the incommensurate limit q 
. it alone gives the explicit asymptotically exact form
of wave functions and provides the hierarchical tree and
topology of the cantor set spectrum. however, the most
interesting quantitative characteristics of the spectrum
are hidden in the nite size corrections of the order of
q2 to the bare value of strings. among them are the
anomalous dimensions of the spectrum j . they depend
on the branch and on arithmetics of  (according to ref.
[25] exponents j vary between 0.171 and 0.374 for the
). can anomalous dimensions be
golden mean  =
found analytically, by nding nite size corrections to the
string solutions? this is a technically involved but a fas-
cinating and important problem. its solution would pro-
vide an ultimate information of the spectrum and most
interesting physical properties of the system. it also may
suggest the conformal bootstrap and operator algebra ap-
proach, which has been proven to be eective for nding
the nite size corrections of integrable systems, without
the actual solving the bethe ansatz.
