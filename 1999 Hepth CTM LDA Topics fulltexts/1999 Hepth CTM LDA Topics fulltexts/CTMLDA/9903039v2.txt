abstract

we study the microcanonical description of string gases in the presence of d-branes.
we obtain exact expressions for the single string density of states and draw the regions
in phase space where asymptotic approximations are valid. we are able to describe the
whole range of energies including the sym phase of the d-branes and we remark the
importance of the infrared cut-o used in the high energy approximations. with the
complete expression we can obtain the density of states of the multiple string gas and
study its thermal properties, showing that the hagedorn temperature is maximum for
every system and there is never a phase transition whenever there is thermal contact
among the strings attached to dierent d-branes.

1 introduction

finite temperature frameworks are in general very interesting laboratories in which to
study the fundamental degrees of freedom of a theory. in the case of string theory the
interest increases because of the exponential growth of the number of states with the
mass. this behavior, known as the hagedorn spectrum [1], is relevant because of the
fact that it generates a critical thermodynamics that in principle could correspond to a
phase transition [2, 3, 4, 5]. the analysis of this possibility was rstly attempted from
the canonical ensemble [2, 3, 4, 5], but it seems that a more fundamental description of
the degrees of the system is needed.

the description that, in principle, would clarify the open questions on the hagedorn
thermodynamics is that of the microcanonical ensemble [7, 6, 8, 9]. the density of states
of the string gas was studied in the early works [7, 6] on the subject by taking an am-
biguous high energy approximation. in fact the thermodynamics for the closed strings
that was derived there do not have any information about the low energy behavior of the
system. this prevents any trustable study on the way the system reaches the hagedorn
temperature.

on the other hand in [7, 6] there was a disregarding of the volume dependence on the
density of states that led to the surprising conclusion that there is a dierence between
a system with an already open universe and one in which we take to innity the radii of
the initial torus [6].

in [8, 9] another point of view was claimed. the density of states of the single closed
string valid for all energies was obtained. the multiple string one was formally dened
from the convolution theorem [8], and it was shown that for an already open universe the
systems reaches the hagedorn temperature for a nite energy per string. at this point
a phase transition occurs in such a way that the temperature is kept constant and the
specic heat diverges. by this analysis it was possible to know how the systems evolve
from low energy to the high energy limit.

the compactied case was studied in [9]. in this background the system has a unique
phase with nite and positive specic case. the hagedorn temperature works as the
limiting one. an interesting point was that in the decompactication limit the system
coincided with that of [8].

a common feature appearing in both cases is that at high energies equipartition breaks
at a given energy per string. from this point the system is composed of a dominant highly
energetic long string in thermal contact with a sea of a large number of low energetic
strings that works as a thermal bath. this relevant part of the system was not taken
into account previously in [7, 6] because it emerges from the ir part of the single string
density of states. the existence of the string sea is relevant in order to prevent the negative
specic heat phases.

from an completely dierent perspective the same picture has been recently obtained
[16]. the authors of [16], considered the possibility of a high energetic radiating string.
they discovered that this string would behave as a black body at a temperature th and
if one included a thermal bath composed by low energetic strings the system would reach
equilibrium only if both temperatures, those of the black body and those of the bath,
coincide at the hagedorn value. this strongly supports the idea presented in [8, 9], that

2

a long energetic string would be in thermal equilibrium only in the presence of a thermal
bath at th .

to put it in short: working with approximate expressions without a neatly dened
it is dicult to discern in which situations low energy
range of validity is dangerous.
eects can qualitatively change the conclusion of the physical analysis. this is specially
true in systems composed of many objects, let alone those where a thermodynamical limit
is to be taken and even more near a phase transition, because local and small uctuations
compared to the total energy can always make individual objects visit the regions of phase
space that have been thrown away. in our work we will render an exact calculation of
the single string density of states and a comparison with the dierent approximation that
come from it will be done.

these considerations hold for perturbative string physics.

it has been sometimes
argued that non-perturbative objects would have some role to play in relation to the
hagedorn problem. there have been some works in which this topic has been dealt
with, either trying to include d-branes [15] in the canonical ensemble [10, 11, 12], or
d-instantons [13] eects in the microcanonical ensemble. a laconic nothing happens has
been the usual conclusion. in the former case the problem of approaching the hagedorn
problem from the canonical ensemble is exactly the same that for closed strings. that is
the canonical description breaks and nothing else could be said since this point. in the
latter the main argument is that the energy scales at which the non-perturbative eects
become important are completely dominated by the perturbative hagedorn physics, so it
seems natural to conclude that a subsequent eect cannot regularize an already existing
at low energies one.

d-brane dynamics is governed by the dirichlet open strings attached to it [15], so in
order to study d-brane thermodynamics we need to study the nite temperature version
of these open string theories [10, 11, 12]. on the other hand if we want to study the
complete thermal behavior of type ii string theories we need to account for the closed
string sector and for the corresponding d-branes allowed for each theory. finally if we
want a fundamental understanding of the hagedorn phase of the theory we need to study
it in the microcanonical ensemble. this idea has been recently developed in [18].

in this work the microcanonical density of states has been computed for a variety of
brane congurations by using the methods of [6, 7], and high energy thermodynamics has
been described. a related work was also made in [14].

in the present paper we approach the microcanonical description of thermodynamics
with d-branes as background applying the methods of [8, 9]. the plan of the work is
the following. we begin the analysis by computing the density of states from the mass
spectrum. the next step consists of a computation of the single string density of states by
the method of the inverse laplace transform. we separate the analysis for high energies,
analogous to the analysis of [18], from those valid for the whole energy range. using the
previous results we go to the thermodynamical description of the system .

2 the density of states from the mass spectrum

there are two ways to compute the density of states of the single string system. the
rst one consists of the application of the inverse laplace transform. the method begins

3

with the computation of the helmholtz free energy and then using it as the single string
partition function in such way that we obtain the density of state from the bromwich
integral

(1)(e) =

dz1()ee

(1)

1

2i zc

where z1() = v f (). the n-string term is characterized by the partition function

zn() =

1
n!

z1()n.

(2)

the other way to calculate the microcanonical density of states of a system is to
count the degeneracy in the phase space geometrically. it is specially useful in the case of
compact target backgrounds. in this section we shall implement this idea in our case of a
gas of open superstrings moving in the presence of d-branes. we start with the following
hamiltonian, that corresponds to the mass formula of the theory which. we take it as a
dispersion relation

e2 = ~p2 + ~2 + 2n

(3)

where ~p is the momentum, that is discrete in this case. the dimension of this vector is
the number of neumann directions. ~ is the winding number. it is always perpendicular
to the momentum vector because open strings cannot wind around a direction and have
a momentum at the same time. the dimension of this vector is, thus, the number of
dirichlet directions. n is the total oscillation number. it is the sum

n = x nnn.

(4)

this means that there are several states with the same total oscillator number. they

are counted by the following coecients:

ak =

1

2i i

dq

qk+1  2(q)

3(q)!4 

4(q)!
2   3(q)


2

(5)

where the integrand is the internal partition function of the theory 2.

let us begin to calculate the degeneracy associated to a value of the energy xing

rstly n to a constant. in that case:

on the other hand

~p2 + ~2 = e2  2n = c

~p2 + ~2 = xin n

(7)

2 the dependence of the internal partition function of the theory on the number of mixed, n d and
dn , direction comes from the dierent normal ordering constant of these sectors. we are very grateful
to j.l.f. barbon for focusing our attention on this point.

4

where nn marks the directions with neumann boundary conditions and dd the dirichlet
ones, there are also mixed directions, dn + nd = , that do not contribute to the kine-
matical energy but through their oscillator masses only. this contribution is accounted
by the coecients an . to make things more homogeneous, we can use the variables

ri =

if i is dirichlet

so that

(9)

this is the equation of an ellipsoid in the discrete phase space. we are interested in
counting the number of states for which that relation approximately holds, that is, letting
the energy be in [e  e, e + e]. if the energies are very low, it is important to remind
that e has a lower bound which is the maximum gap between two energy levels. the
number of states is proportional to the volume of the ellipsoidal shell dened by equation
(9). the total volume is

the volume of a thin shell is

v (c) =  d yi

ri! c d/2.

where  d is the angular part. its dependence on the dimension is

 d =

2 d/2

d( d/2)

in our case d = dd + nn  9  , is the number of testable directions.
to get the total degeneracy it is necessary to multiply by the one associated to n (an )
and by the size of the super-multiplet: 24. after the sum over all possible values of n is
performed, the result is
cl(v, e) = 24 2 d/2

(13)
this is not valid for d = 0 because the derivative in (11) is not correct. in that case
there is no continuous contribution from either the momenta or the windings and do the
density of states is just a sum of delta functions centered on the mass levels. we shall
talk further in section 5.

for a value of e, the sum over n is nite because the oscillator number is limited by
the available energy. this is expressed by the heaviside function. the calculation will
be complete when we take into account the quantum statistics. before doing that, let us
add some terms that are important if the proportion between some radii is very dierent
from one. in that case, there is a range of energies where the rst non-zero modes of some
directions lie far beyond the ellipsoid in the phase space and the geometric count is no
longer valid because the single zero mode is not counted as one but as a small fractional
number of states. to simplify, we shall consider all the neumann radii equal and the
same with the dirichlet ones. the only parameters are then rdd and rn n . this can be
generalized to consider all the possibilities but there are too many and all the interesting
physical consequences can be extracted studying this simpler case. the density of states
that this yields is

this result is completely analogous to that of [9]. we will see in next sections how we
can recover the same density of states for the single string system from the study of the
free energy of the theory in the canonical ensemble.

3 high energy density of states

in this section we are going to compute the helmholtz free energy of the dirichlet open
string theory for a variety of d-brane backgrounds from the canonical ensemble, and we
will nally study the dierent limits of the density of states derived from it. we will do
it for the asymptotic high energy range. the approximation is based on the idea that
the existence of the hagedorn critical temperature is an uv phenomenon so it should be
enough to look at the very excited string states to obtain the relevant information, this is
the perspective assumed in [6, 7], and more recently, for the d-brane backgrounds, in [18].
the other option is to try to compute the complete density of states without projecting
out any string states, and will be detailed in the section 5.

we will begin by noticing that the degrees of freedom lost in this high-energy limit,
are, in fact, projected out in the canonical description by a ir cut-o that cannot be
forgotten. if we introduce it explicitly, we would easily see how the massless open strings
are neglected. this projection prevents the possibility of accounting for the low energetic
sea.

let us rstly x our background. suppose we have a conguration with a dp-
brane and a dq-brane. we can dene four dierent types of directions, the dirichlet-
dirichlet(dd),neumann-neumann (nn), nd and dn. the last two do not contribute to
the mass of the strings, apart from the oscillation terms (that means that we can neither
have momentum nor winding in these directions). we will include in this classication of
the directions the spatial ones only. they are related by

dd + nn + dn + nd = 9.

(18)

the euclidean time is supposed to be compactied on a circle of length . another
interesting parameter we will deal with is the sum of the mixed directions,  = nd +dn.
the interest of it comes from the fact that the when  = 0, 4, 8 the string gas is evolving
in a completely supersymmetric background. we will focus our study on this type of
brane conguration, however some comments on more general ones will be made.

in brief, the strings quantum numbers are: the momentum mode in the nn directions;
the winding mode in the dd ones and the matsubara frequency in the euclidean time,
the dn and nd direction do not contribute to the mass of the strings.

we can now compute the helmholtz free energy as the vacuum energy of the theory

described above. it formally reads

 f () = t rh(1)f z

the high energy behavior of the open string gas may be studied in the canonical
ensemble and that is the easiest way of visualizing the hagedorn critical behavior. let us
begin our study by looking at this region. when the energy is large the string modes that
dominate the dynamics will be the massive ones. these are enclosed in the uv region of
the previous expression, that is accounted by the large t limit. we can introduce an ir
cut-o 2 in (21), and in this way we will forget about low energetic strings, we have

n n

 f () = z 2
in order to study the uv limit (t  0) it is convenient to take advantage of modular
properties of the theta functions in the free energy going to the closed-string channel by
making t = 22s1, obtaining

(27)

in that way the winding and momentum modes are included into the mass m. in what
follows we will collect the numerical factors into a multiplicative constant c. when
(m, n, ) = 0 we arrive at a critical temperature analogous to the hagedorn one. in
fact we can see that at those temperatures a string state becomes massless. when the
temperatures are passed through this states get a negative squared mass, that is, it
becomes tachyonic. we can solve the equation for the critical temperatures obtaining

c =

with 0 < n  z.

(28)

with n = 1 and m = 0 we have the lowest critical temperature that corresponds to
the hagedorn one. the following critical points are obtained for bigger temperatures,
in fact we can in principle have negative unphysical solutions for c. this possibility is
avoided by assuming that the compactication radii are bigger than the selfdual ones.

at this moment we can write the helmholtz free energy as a sum over functions which
are analytical in the whole complex- plane except in the neighborhood of c. the sum
reads

 f () = c

finally we can integrate the previous expression in order to obtain a closed expression
for the free energy in the high energy limit. using the integral representation of the

the problem of obtaining the single string density of states from the free energy below
is reduced to an inverse laplace transformation. it is known that the result of this kind
of computation is closely related with the analytical properties of the function to be
transformed. we can look at (30) as a sum of independent terms seeing that each one is
characterized by its behavior in the neighborhood of its thermal critical point c. we see
that the analytical properties are enclosed in the simple pole and in the more complicate
properties of the incomplete gamma function. the computation of the density of states
here would consist of a straightforward adaptation of those in [8].

before showing the results of the computation let us comment some words about the
cut-o 2. we can try to extend the validity of the approximation taking the value of 2
to innity. it will give us the complete version of the gamma function. the analytical
properties of the free energy are enclosed inside the single pole appearing at each critical
if we complete the ir part of the free energy by simply taking 2 to
temperature.
innity we will obtain an ir regular series for the density of states of the single string.
the thermodynamics derived from it would have a positive and nite specic heat phase
only, in which the asymptotic maximum temperature is the hagedorn one. we think that
this corresponds to a misconception. the ir behavior that one could obtain from the
previous procedure is at least not complete. it is due to the fact that if we took a large
2 limit we could not truncate the string theory partition function as we did in (25), but
we should have included all the string modes.

we think that the correct way of using the previous free energies consist of keeping
2 nite, and making inverse laplace transformation of the laurent series around the
critical points. doing it we will see that we obtain an asymptotic series that does not
work for the ir regime.

following the previous prescriptions we can make the same computation of the high

energy single string density of states as in [8], it gives

where a(c, n, m, p) is a constant independent of e but dependent, through c, of the
r parameters, and h(x) is the heaviside function. the sum in m comes from a taylor
expansion of the incomplete gamma function.
the behavior is in general governed by a leading term that corresponds to the hagedorn
singularity. we will come back to the details later but let us sketch the general dynamics.
we nd a positive, but innite, specic heat phase. the leading term does not give
any negative powers of the energy taking us to theory with a constant temperature and
innite specic heat behavior. the subleading terms give corrections for small energies.
the string gas takes a nite and positive specic heat phase.

we think that these corrections are meaningless because the density of states is only
valid for a very high energy, and in order to know the low energetic phase we need an
ir-complete density of states. we will come back on these features later when studying
the thermodynamical behavior of the gas.

it seems interesting to study the high energy density of states when we open some of
the dd directions. this case physically means that there would be a reduced number
of testable directions for the single string and has shown its interest in previous studies
[7, 18, 17]. the result is analogous to (31).
it is implemented by taking some of the
dd, (let it be a number 0  a  dd of them), innite. we will also suppose that the
momenta on the nn directions are continuous so

including it into (24), and then also in(28), we arrive at the following uv canonical free

where d is dened as a eective number of testable dimensions. it is given by

d = (dd  a) + nn  9  .

the meaning of this number of dimensions and the existence of testable energy scales
will be discussed later.

in this case the ananlytical properties are more complicate. in general we can see that
we have a branch point located at each critical temperature, concretely it will happens
for an odd number of untestable dd directions, while for even ones we would have high
order pole singularities. the ir continuation, by taking 2 to innity, is not well dened
here. the density of states that results from inverse laplace transform (33) is

this result describes a purely neumann open string theory in nn target dimensions.
the energy dependence of the thermodynamics in the microcanonical ensemble exactly
matches with a certain brane conguration described by (35), but without any volume
dependence of the dd side.

in (31) and following, we can see that the density of states for the single string system
obtained with this procedure is useless in the ir regime because of the use of the ir cut-
o. this property prevents the use of this magnitude for the computation of the multiple
string system by the convolution procedure [8].

4 high energies thermodynamics

in this part of our work we will go on the thermal properties of the single string system by
using the density of states in (35). we will begin with the analysis of the ranges of validity
and we nally try to extract from it some results on the multiple string thermodynamics.
in this section we will be interested in comparing our results with those of [18] and we
will nd where their asymptotic approach breaks down making the convolution approach
of [8, 9] indispensable.

let us begin by simply computing the microcanonical temperature. at rst order it

singularity. the properties that we can derive from it hold only at high energies. we will
detail the analysis of the validity range in detail later.

the temperature that results from (37) are drawn in the fig.(1), where we have plotted
the temperature versus the energy of the string. we can see that the systems have negative
specic heat phase in all cases except for d +  = 9 in which the entropy is proportional,
at leading order, to the energy. in this case the system has an innite specic heat phase
only, that corresponds to a constant temperature. this is the only case in which the
hagedorn temperature plays the role of limiting temperature for the single string. the
extrapolation for the multiple string system must be done carefully3. we have introduced
the eective dimension d that correspond to the number of dimensions the system can

probe. in fact we have the nn dimensions, that will be supposed to give a continuous
momentum spectrum, and dd  a dirichlet dimensions the string can wrap around. to
eliminate possible winding excitations around a dirichlet directions we have already taken
the corresponding radii to innity. however we could wonder that the system has not
enough energy to reach a winding state even when the radii are nite. physically this
situation can be clearly explained for the single string system but it comes to us more
subtle for the multiple string gas. in fact in order to prevent the winding excitations one
has to take the energy lower than r2
a. if we impose it for the multiple string gas it would
reduce the system to evolve in a very low energetic phase.

let us see it explicitly. if we introduce the parameters n , that corresponds to the
energy per string, and the number of strings per unit of nn volume n, we conclude that

n <

ra
nv n n = .

(39)

then if we want to take a thermodynamic limit (v n n  , and all the densities nite),
we need to take the a radii to innity too.
in summary, if we want to make a dimension untestable for the multiple string system
we should to take its radius to innity, if we did not do it we might be able to talk
about reduced eective dimension at very low energy densities n . in order to make our
work complete we will make the analysis for string gases with large, but nite, ra radius
specially focusing our attention on the its limitation.

firstly we need to nd the energy ranges in which the term corresponding to the
hagedorn critical point in (35) dominates the thermal properties. it will correspond to
those energies at which the subleading terms are negligible, that is

e(h c)e  o(0)  (h  c)e  1.

on the other hand we need to remember that the hagedorn term in (35) is null for

e <

2
h2 = ec

(40)

(41)

where this condition comes from the heaviside function. the combination of the previous
expression gives the range of energies at which the system has a simply hagedorn behavior.
in order to specify it we need to know how is the dependence of (40) on c.

we know that the critical points are given by (28). because of the assumption that
momenta should be continuous we only deal with critical points coming from winding
modes and high-mass levels of the string. for the latter we conclude that the second
critical point 2 = 2 could be neglected at energies

(42)

so we must worry about critical temperatures lower than 1

the thermal behavior is suppressed at energies

(43)

finally we will also consider the energies at which the winding states become to appear
and consequently the density of states that neglects it becomes to fail. it occurs when
e > rdd/ = e. along all these consideration we have assumed the radii of all the
dirichlet directions to have the same value rdd.

we are now able to consider the phase space dened by rdd and e and to study
the dierent regions that emerge from the previous conditions. these regions will be
separated by the equality relationship between e, eh and the energy of the system e.
the resulting phase space is sketched in fig.(2).

at radius rdd, while the purely neumann and a dirichlet ones are already open.

suppose the system we are interested has dd  a dirichlet dimensions compactied
if eh  e  e the winding states are excited when the hagedorn term of the
density of states clearly dominates the dynamics of the system. as a consequence the
winding inuence could be neglected.
in this case the thermal behavior of the single
string is accounted by the rst term of (35) with d = nn + dd  a. this is in fact the
situation in which the radius of the dd direction is small and could be better treated by
tacking advantage of t -duality converting the dd directions into nn ones. in the gure
this regime correspond the region i.

13

in the case in which eh  e  e, the region ii of the picture, we have a system
that eectively lives in a space without the dd directions and whose thermodynamics is
governed by the hagedorn term. the density of states in this case is the leading term of
(36). however the existence of this region is closely related to the value of the cut-o 2,
and appears at energies e  ec, so we think that it must be studied by the ir regular
density of states.
we can go now to the region iii in which e  eh  e. this region behaves
exactly in the same way as the region ii, but the dierence comes from the fact that it
appears for every value of the cut-o 2. on the other hand it must be described by the
high energy density of states in an a-dimensional background.

finally we must look to the region iv . it corresponds to e  e  eh. in this
case all the terms of (35) are relevant. we think that it would be better accounted
with a complete density of states, overall when going to the multiple string system. the
advantage of the asymptotic expression over the exact one, that is simplicity, is lost and
it is better to use the complete series.

we would like to make two nal comments on the thermodynamics at high energies.
it is interesting to note that if we pass from the region iii to the i of the phase space,
by increasing the energy of the system, it could test large extra dimensions. then by this
mechanism we can change the dimensionality if the background in which the system is
evolving.

on the other hand it seem remarkable to us that there are some target background
in which by this transition, we pass from a system which has a negative specic heat to
another one with a positive and nite specic heat and which asymptotically ends at the
hagedorn temperatures. in terms the nomenclature of [18] we go from a non-limiting case
to a limiting one.

finally we would like to mention how these densities of states could apply for the
multiple string gas. using the convolution description of [8] we know that the multiple
string gas density of states is obtained as

(e) =



xn =0

1
n!

(1)(e)      (1)(e)

(44)

where the stars stand for convolution integrals. one of the possible approximations at
high energy that we can do for the density of states of the n-string gas is to consider it
as behaving as a single long string. if we use this picture we arrive at

1
n!

(1)(e)      (1)(e) 

1

n!  a

v n n

v dd!n

(1)(e)

(45)

where a is a factor that must be computed for each case. the simplest one are those in
which the single string is hagedorn dominated, and we nally obtain an ultra-high energy
density of states as

(e) 

eh e+a v n n
e(9 d)/2 h (e  ec) .

v dd

(46)

it corresponds to the leading order in the computation of [7, 18] and the corrections come
from the series of (1)(e). the thermal behavior of the multiple string system exactly

14

matches with the single string one with the previous assumption, as for 1(e) it does
not work in the ir region. we nally conclude that only a complete computation of the
single string density of states can be trusted for the multiple object gas.

5 the complete density of states

in what follows we will obtain the complete density of state for the single string and use
it to describe the string gas thermodynamics. the idea here is to try to inverse laplace
transform the whole free energy of the open string gas. the method that we will follow
was presented in [8]. we write the free energy of the open string theory as

 f () = (2)(n n +dd+1)/2 v n n

v dd

f (t).

(47)

where the internal partition function is taken as in (22). the parameter m 2 is the mass
of the closed string boundary states propagating between the branes with the euclidean
time compactied on a circle of length . it is given by

(48)

at this moment we need to express the internal partition function as a sum over open
string states. more concretely we want to explicitly write

f (t) =

ak =

(49)

including the previous taylor expansion and the parameter  in (47), we can nally write

(50)

by using the integral representation of the bessel functions k(z) we can express the

(51)

where the constant in front of the integral (47) have been ignored.

at this moment we would like to obtain the single string density of states by the inverse
laplace transformation of the free energy in (51) as it was done in [8]. the complicate
dependence of the argument of the bessel function on the compactication parameters,
the radii r, and on the inverse temperature , makes this computation hard. we will
attempt it by a simple trick, that however seems useful to study some interesting and
simpler limit before.

15

let us begin with the study of the decompactication limit that corresponds to tak-
ing all the radii to innity.
in this background the relevant degrees of freedom would
correspond to the momenta in the nn directions. as we discussed in section 3 this is
the only way to completely avoid the winding contribution. it is due to the fact that we
can forget about the winding states for the single string by taking its energy smaller than
the squared dirichlet radius rdd, but in order to do the same for the multiple string gas
we must prevent the statistical uctuations that could allow a winding nucleation. the
density of energy is nally constrained to be in a low range of values by (39). in summary,
the correct way to study the system in absence of winding states consists of taking the
radius of the dd direction to innity and not to assume string energies lower than the
winding masses.

we take the desired limit in (21), by assuming the nn momenta to have a continuous

spectrum and taking only into account the winding zero mode we arrive at

the density of states corresponding to this free energy can be obtained by using exactly
the same method of [8], getting the following result

we can compare the high energy density of states for the single string system in the
open universe case, that corresponds to the result expressed in (36). the crucial dierence
comes from the ir behavior. the expression in (54) is regular at low energies because we
did not exclude out any mass levels of the string, as we did for the rst case, by using 2.
the critical hagedorn phenomenon here is hidden in the growth of the coecient ak, and
appears as the energy is big enough to open massive string thresholds.

we can compute the density of states for the string gas living in a universe with
compact dimensions. the way of computing it is the same we have used above. in this
case the free energy is represented by the k1/2(z) bessel function. the trick that we will
use here to use the result of [8] and obtain the density of states consists of writing the
free energy in (47) as

the case in which all the dimensions are compact and their radii are small enough to
force us to consider the spectrum of momentum and winding strongly discretized, is very
subtle. we will then begin with the case in which we assume that the nn direction are
open and the dd ones are compactied before. the density of states in this case is

(1)(e) =

2v n n (4)

where the string masses now are related to the winding number only

with this density of state is very easy to study the case in which the single string cannot
probe some dd direction. it is simply accounted by taking some of the winding radii
to innity, another important feature is that the ir validity of it allows us to study the
multiple string gas and then we would be able to analyze the possibility of dening some
eective dimensions and the existence of energy density scales that probe extra large
compactied directions.

finally we are able to obtain the density of states, for the a null number of non-compact

nn dimensions. it corresponds to

(1)(e) =

2
( 0

2) xn=odd

(59)

the rst noticeable feature of this result is that we do not have any continuous depen-
dence on the energy. the density of states above strictly corresponds to the degeneracy
of each mass level without any kinematical contribution. on the other hand we know
that by t -dualizing the nn directions we can describe the system of wrapped d-branes
as a system of d-particles on a torus. it is interesting to note that if we take the radii of
the dd direction to innity we arrive at a system of d0-branes in an already open target
space. in this case the density of states is reduced to a sum of the mass degeneracy times
the dirac-delta function located at each mass level.

two relevant limits of this result should be analyzed. if we take the energy to be large
one we should arrive at a result related to the exponential growth of the degeneracy of
string mass levels. doing it in (59) we in fact arrive at

(1)(e = m)  eh m m9/2h m 

2

h2! ,

(60)

that corresponds to the leading term of (36) and to the critical behavior studied in the
early works on the subject [1, 2]. as we mention before, because of the absence of
any kinematical degrees of freedom, the energy here is exactly the mass of the strings.
what is remarkable is that once again the cut-o establish the range of validity of the
approximation.

17

on the other hand it is interesting to relate the previous result to the sym description
of the d-brane thermodynamics [10, 11, 12] and more concretely to the nite temperature
behavior of matrix model of m-theory [19, 20]. taking the massless limit of the open
string theory on the brane we arrive to the sym description of the system. on the
microcanonical side this is implemented by simply taking into account the rst term of
the density of states above. it nally gives a constant density of states that equals the
polarization of the massless string modes times a delta at zero energy. we can obtain the
same result by rstly starting by the canonical free energy of the sym0+1 theory. it reads

f ()  1



xn=odd

n1.

(61)

if we make the inverse laplace transformation of z 1() = f (), we easily see that the
single-object density of states (1)
sy m (e) exactly matches the massless limit of our result
in (59).

one nal comment. the density of states in (59) has the divergent ( 0

2) in the pref-
actor. the value of this function makes the density of states vanish and this needs some
interpretation. what is happening is that, because of the compactness of the background
universe, the spectrum of the string mass is discrete. this means that in a given energy
range there could be isolated accessible states only, in such a way that we cannot dene
a density of states. in our computation we have supposed the spectrum to be continuous
and we recover a vanishing (1) for the single string. in principle thermodynamics is not
aected because, in the microcanonical ensemble, the physical magnitudes come from the
derivatives of the entropy, which is proportional to the logarithm of the density of states,
so we can anyway neglect any multiplicative constant.

6 the number of strings and the entropy.

in [8, 9, 6, 7, 14] a picture was studied for the phase transition occurring at the hage-
dorn temperature. the transition signal was the appearance of a fat string that breaks
equipartition and absorbs enough energy to excite high mass levels while all the others
remain massless and form a kind of background, that we called the sea [8, 9]. we would
like now to see how the number of strings evolves and how the sea and the fat string share
the energy as the volume varies. to study that, we approximate the high-energy density
of states by

high(e, esea, v ) = v (e  esea) a

(62)

(63)

where a is a constant integer that depends on the model and the d-brane background,
d is the number of open dimensions (testable and continuous at low energies), n is the
number of strings and esea is the mean energy of the sea. we can use concepts like average
energy in spite of working with the microcanonical ensemble because we have separated

18

our microcanonical system into two parts. each possesses a thermodynamical (physically
innite) number of degrees of freedom so that they act as an energy reservoir for the
other. that is, the sea of massless strings can be thought of as a gas in the canonical
ensemble. throughout the following calculation we shall ignore the thermal uctuations,
so that we shall suppose that the energy or the volume are large enough.

firstly, we calculate how the energy is shared between both subsystems. the most

probable distribution is given by the following equation:

the solution to it is

dhigh

(65)

each light string having an average energy d/h, which is the energy at which the massless
elds reach the hagedorn temperature in d spatial dimensions. this result was already
obtained in [8] using a model of kinetic theory.

this is part of the equation of state and it allows us to write

high(e, esea, v ) = high(e, n, v ).

(66)

this form of the density of states permits to calculate the most probable average
number of strings for given values of the total energy and the volume and therefore, how
the energy is shared between the two subsystems. the equation is:

(67)

for certain values of v and n the energy of the fat string becomes small or even
negative, that is, it ceases to exist. this gives a critical value for f (v ) that separates two
phases with and without the fat string. the phase without fat string is easy to analyze
because the main contribution comes from the massless string gas. its density of states is

(e, v ) =

the subsequent analysis of this expressions depends on the particular form of f (v ).
in the case of closed strings it is v + 1/v , that tends to v away from the selfdual volume.
besides, d equals 9 and a equals 1/2. as a result, equation (67) gives a critical value
of crit  159 strings per 9/2.
if we now take the thermodynamical limit (v and e
 ) n dynamically diverges maintaining the densities nite. as both densities,  and
, grow together, any of them can be taken as the only parameter dening the system.
the physical picture is as follows: if the density is lower than the critical one, the system
behaves like a massless gas in ten dimensions and the temperature grows linearly with
. when the density reaches the critical value a phase transition occurs and, as the
correlation length tends to innity, the system tends to concentrate the energy on one
fat string with innite mass. beyond the transition point, the energy of the fat string
becomes nite and decreasing with the density. the niteness of ef at drive us to formally
say that its energy density is zero. we use the inverted commas because one can hardly
talk about a density for a single object but this is quite a peculiar one because it has
inuence over global properties. its role is to regulate the temperature so that the bath
always remains at th. the system prefers to create more and more light strings rather
than exciting higher massive modes of the already existing ones.

the evolution of the temperature is singular. at low energies, the temperature grows
with increasing specic heat. at the critical point, the temperature is th and remains so
thereafter with innite specic heat. this is a conrmation of the image depicted in [8].
fig.(5) shows the qualitative behavior.

the case of open strings attached to d-branes is quite dierent because

the transition depends on how we take to innite both volumes. if

f (v ) =

vn n
vdd

.

vn n
vdd  

the analysis is identical to that of closed strings, but dening a new density

 =

vn n

(71)

(72)

(73)

it is the density of strings one would dene in the t-dual theory where all the directions
have neumann boundary conditions. other possible limit is the opposite one

vn n
vdd  0

(74)

which is equivalent to taking  to innite. the energy of the fat string tends to zero but
is still acts as a regulator so that there is an equilibrium between an unstable fat string
and the sea that lls the space at th.

there is one exceptional case when a = 0, that is, for open strings in a completely
testable universe. in that case, the breaking of equipartition is quite peculiar. compare
gs. (3) and (4). there is never a sharp peak in the density of states of several strings

energy

signaling the most probable appearance of a fat one that absorbs much more energy than
the others. rather, there is a spread in the probability that means that the uctuations
in the energy of a single component are comparable to the total energy. this invalidates
the physical image of the single string dominance of thermodynamics and even prevents
the correction of it due to what we have called the sea. the correct physical image is a
gas where equipartition more or less holds but with very large uctuations in the energy
of particular strings. this makes the need for the exact calculation stronger because the
probability of nding a string in virtually any point of the phase space is large. the only
prediction that can be obtained with the asymptotic expressions is that the asymptotic
temperature is hagedorn and that the specic heat is always positive.

this is the only case in which there is not a phase transition if we take the appearance
of the fat string as the order parameter. however, at energy densities beyond the planck
scale, the system acquires a rather anomalous behavior. for the moment, we cannot
precise if it corresponds to a higher order phase transition or simply a soft change of
behavior.

the dierence between the usual microcanonical point of view and this one is the
fact that here we are letting the number of strings dynamically vary, that is, we are
working in the (e, v , )-ensemble instead of the pure microcanonical. the former is
more adapted to the string gases because they naturally have a xed and null chemical
potential. somehow, it is a way to gather the dierent descriptions in terms of nite-
n gases together. as explained in sections 4 and 5, one can make convolutions of the
single string density of states and obtain the behavior of dierent subsystems with a xed
number of constituents. the (e, v , )-ensemble shows us how the transition between
them happen.

the inclusion of the sea as an important contribution to thermodynamics has conse-
quences on the estimation of the entropy. one has to add the logarithm of (62), that is,
in the large-n limit

s(v, e, n) = log(v, e, n) = 10n + nlog

cv e9

(75)

where c is a constant. substituting the value of n that solves the equation of state (69),
it is

s(v, e) = 10n =

this is the leading contribution except when a = 0.

let us now write about the pressure. the density of states that we have obtained in

the previous section has the functional form:

where

(v, e) = f (e)  g(v )

g(v ) =

vn n
vdd

(77)

(78)

this means that the dependence of the pressure on the temperature is the same as
that of the free energy. however, its dependence on the volume is not trivial at all. let
us recall that, in traditional theories

.

(79)

p = 

f

v (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)t

however, we know that t-duality is an exact symmetry in type ii string theory. this
means [9] that every physical (measurable) magnitude must be invariant under t-duality.
this, of course, includes the pressure. the usual denition, that we have written just
above, is not t-selfdual and therefore it must be corrected and substituted with another.
we shall use the proposal in [9].

similar up to a multiplicative constant term. in fact one can see that what really coincides

one remarkable characteristic of the pressure we have calculated is that, in certain
cases, it vanishes. this happens whenever the number of directions with neumann and
dirichlet boundary conditions coincide. this is only possible if an odd number of dimen-
sions is untestable.

7 conclusions

in this paper we have studied the thermal behavior of string systems in d-brane back-
grounds in the microcanonical ensemble. the goal of this kind of analysis is to delucidate
what is the role of the hagedorn temperature in the thermodynamics of dirichlet open
string theories. as in the closed string cases the necessity of the microcanonical descrip-
tion comes from the breaking of the canonical ensemble at hagedorn temperatures.

our strategy has been as follows, and is along the lines of [8, 9]. we have begun by a
computation of the asymptotic density of states of the single string. these computation
are analogous to those of [6, 7] for the closed-string gas and have been recently used for
the d-brane cases in [18]. we have shown that this procedure corresponds to including an
ir cut-o 2 that eliminates the contribution of the massless string modes. consequently
the densities of states obtained are not valid for the low energetic regime. we have studied
the range of validity of this approximation in terms of the energy of the system, the radii
of the compact dimensions and the value of 2. the result is a kind of phase space where
dierent parts are best described by particular approximations. only two of these parts
are well described by the asymptotic density of states, approximated by the hagedorn
term only. passing from one of them to the other the number of eective dimensions of
the target space the string gas lives on changes. we claimed that in order to completely
know the thermal behavior it is necessary to use a complete, ir regular density of states.
on the other hand the thermodynamics of the string gas is not exactly described
by the single string system, so we need to study the multiple string density of states.
we should follow the convolution prescription of [8]. however it is not possible to do it

23

using the high energy densities of states of the single string because of their irregular ir
behavior. finally one is lead to look for a complete density of states.

before computing the desired density of states we have analyzed the thermal properties
of the single string. we have shown that there is a negative specic heat phase in all cases
except for the d +  = 9 one. in the latter we have an ir denite phase but we think that
at these energies the density of states does not include all the information. it is in fact
obvious that the corrections to the leading behavior are strongly dependent of 2,and
that way nothing warrants that we are including all the ir degrees of freedom of the
theory. the only extractable conclusion is that after including all the ir information we
will still have a positive specic heat phase, and hagedorn will be a asymptotic maximum
temperature of the system.

we have calculated an exact expression for the single string density of states in section
5. it is got in the form of a series with a nite number of terms for nite values of the
energy. the results are analogous of those in [8, 9]. with those instruments, we are
able to study the thermodynamics of the systems and also to match our results with
those obtained using the symp+1 description of the d-branes dynamics. we have used
the d +  = 9 cases as some special examples. in one of them, dd = 9, we are able
to connect with the matrix model microcanonical description, in the born-oppenheimer
approximation.

in particular, we study the distribution of energy among the constituents. this gives
us physical images that help us test models that had been proposed in earlier works
[8, 9, 6]. when a fat string with more energy than the rest appears and, therefore,
equipartition is broken, a phase transition occurs. we have been able to distinguish the
cases in which this happens and in which it does not. we have seen how this aects the
temperature and the specic heat value, the case in which the phase transition occurs has
been plotted in fig.(5). when several of this systems are put in thermal contact, that
is, when open strings attached to dierent d-branes and free closed strings thermally
interact, the behavior of the global system is dominated by the most degenerate phase.
this is the one that gives lower temperature and smaller specic heat for a value of the
energy: open strings with d +  = 9. a similar picture has already been obtained in [18];
the dierence between our picture and theirs is that in ours all subsystems have th as the
maximum temperature. there is not any non-limiting system with temperatures higher
that th. our result is that systems can be classied between those with phase transition
and those without it. the systems without phase transition are the closed strings in a
completely compactied space [9] and open strings with d +  = 9. whenever there is
at least one open direction, the only system that does not suer phase transition is that
of open strings with d +  = 9. when one considers the whole system made up with
closed strings and open strings of various types (various values of ,dd and nn), the
most degenerate system dominates the thermodynamics.
it is always the one without
transition. this means that the existence of one d-brane prevents any phase transition,
except when some dd are open.

along all these considerations we have considered all the untestable dd direction to
be already open. if we had not done it we would have found some of the previous systems
in thermal contact having the phase transition. it corresponds to systems that stand in
region iii of g.(2). this systems have the energy per string (n ) constraint by (39).

temperature through the long string nucleation

on the other hand we know that the phase transition occurs at e/n  d th = h .
two possibilities come. if h <  the systems suers a phase transition. else we need
to include all winding states and nally we pass to the region i where we do not nd
any phase trasition. we think that in the thermodynamic limit, where  goes to zero, a
phase transition is prevented.

regarding the pressure, we calculate it in several cases and see the peculiarities of

string systems using the string-theory denition of it proposed in [9].

finally, we use the fat string-sea model to make a calculation in a genuinely ther-
modynamic limit, and see the evolution of the temperature as a function of string and
energy densities instead of absolute magnitudes.
