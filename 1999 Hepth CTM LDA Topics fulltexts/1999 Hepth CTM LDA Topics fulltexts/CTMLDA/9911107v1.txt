abstract

a proof of renormalizability of the theory of the dynamical non-abelian

two-form is given using the zinn-justin equation. two previously unknown

symmetries of the quantum action, dierent from the brst symmetry, are

needed for the proof. one of these is a gauge fermion dependent nilpotent

symmetry, while the other mixes dierent elds with the same transformation

properties. the brst symmetry itself is extended to include a shift transfor-

mation by use of an anticommuting constant. these three symmetries restrict

the form of the quantum action up to arbitrary order in perturbation theory.

the results show that it is possible to have a renormalizable theory of massive

vector bosons in four dimensions without a residual higgs boson.

i. introduction

each and every aspect of the standard model has been tested in recent years, with re-

markable agreement with theory, except in one sector. the standard model predicts the

existence of the higgs boson, responsible for making gauge bosons and fermions massive, as

well as breaking the su(2)u(1) symmetry of the theory down to the u(1) of electromag-

netism. but no elementary scalar has yet been observed in any particle interaction, nor has

any experiment so far detected the higgs boson, either elementary or composite. on the

other hand, various theoretical constraints put the upper bound of the higgs boson mass

only a little out of reach of present day experiments. it is therefore useful to consider the

scenario in which the higgs boson remains unobserved as the theoretical bounds are reached.

apart from the higgs boson and a possible neutrino mass, the standard model agrees

quite closely with experiment, so it is a good idea to leave most of the theory untouched.

the role of the higgs boson may be distributed among possibly dierent mechanisms for

generating vector and fermion masses, and symmetry breaking. the higgs mechanism does

all this in a renormalizable and unitary way [1], and any alternative must not aect these

good quantum properties of the theory. a possible alternative for generating vector boson

masses is to use a dynamical two-form. when an antisymmetric tensor potential b is coupled

to the eld strength f of a u(1) gauge eld via a topological b  f coupling and a kinetic

term for b is included, the gauge eld develops an eective mass [25]. the mass is equal

to the dimensionful coupling constant m of the interaction term, and there is no residual

scalar (higgs) degree of freedom. if a non-abelian version of this theory can be consistently

quantized, it may be applied to particle interactions.

no-go theorems [6,7] based on the consistency of quantum symmetries rule out most,

but not all, alternative higgs free mechanisms of vector boson mass generation. one useful

exception is the topological mass generation mechanism [8] which has seen renewed interest

in recent years [911]. this mechanism uses an auxiliary vector eld to close the symmetry

algebra and thus avoid the no-go theorems. the price one has to pay is to have non-

2

propagating bosonic and ghost elds in the theory, which disappear in the abelian limit. the

no-go theorem of [7] says only that the non-abelian model cannot be constructed from the

abelian model, which is known to be quantizable [4]. it does not rule out the quantizability

of the non-abelian model itself. however that is not in itself a proof that the model is

quantizable, and a proof has not been constructed as yet. the rst step in such a proof

is the construction of a brst-invariant tree-level action, which was done from a geometric

point of view in [9] and ab initio in [10].

in this paper i construct the quantum action up to arbitrary order in perturbation theory

starting from the brst-invariant tree-level action. i follow an algebraic procedure along

the lines of what is done for yang-mills theories [12,13]. the construction itself is rather

involved  there are dierent elds with the same transformation properties. this suggests

that the usual brst symmetry is not sucient to restrict the operators in the quantum

action. fortunately there are other useful symmetries of the tree-level action and they,

together with the brst symmetry, are sucient for the purpose. in sec. ii i list the brst

transformation rules of the theory and construct another brst-like nilpotent symmetry,

obtained by exchanging the roles of antighosts and their corresponding auxiliary elds. in

sec. iii i construct the quantum symmetries corresponding to these and other symmetries,

and in sec. iv i nd all the dimension four operators allowed by all the symmetries. finally,

sec. v carries a small discussion of possible extensions and applications of the results.

ii. conventions and symmetries

in this section i shall x my conventions. i shall work with an su(n) gauge group, with

generators ta satisfying

[ta, tb] = if abc tc,

(2.1)

with the structure constants f abc totally antisymmetric in its indices. the gauge index will

be made explicit in general for easier tracking of numerical coecients.

the classical action for the dynamical non-abelian two-form [8] is

here f is the curvature of a gauge connection a with gauge coupling g,

f a

 .

(2.2)

(2.3)

the compensated eld strength h is dened with the help of an auxiliary eld c by

the relation

h a

 = (d[b])a + ighf[, c]ia

= [ba

] + gf abcab

[bc

]  gf abcf b

[c c
].

(2.4)

all the three elds a, b and c belong to the adjoint representation of some gauge group

g, and therefore the action (2.2) remains invariant under gauge transformations given by

a  uau 1 

i
g

uu 1,

b  ub u 1,

c  ucu 1,

u  g .

(2.5)

in addition, the action s0 is invariant under vector gauge transformations given by

a  a,

b  b + d[],

c  c +  ,

(2.6)

where  is some arbitrary vector eld in the adjoint representation of the gauge group

which vanishes at innity.

quantization of this theory requires gauge-xing and therefore the introduction of ghosts.

the gauge xed action, together with the ghost terms, is brst invariant. the vector

gauge symmetry requires ghosts of ghosts, and o-shell nilpotence of the brst charge

requires auxiliary elds. let me write the gauge-xing functions as f a, f a and f a for

gauge transformations, vector gauge transformations and gauge transformations of ghosts,

respectively. i shall choose the gauge functions to be of the usual lorenz gauge type,

f a = aa,

f a = ba ,

f a = a ,

(2.7)

4

but most of the results in this paper will hold for arbitrary linear gauge functions. some

discussion about this is presented in the appendix.

the tree level quantum action can be written as [9,10]

s = s0 +z d4x(cid:20)haf a + aa +

1
2

+a

a +

ha

haha+ ha

 (f a + na)

1
2

ha   aa + af a + aa +  aai .

(2.8)

here a, a and a are the brst variations, as dened below, of f a, f a and f a,

respectively. the appearance of na in the gauge-xing condition is usual for two-form

gauge-elds. the gauge-xing condition f a = 0 holds upon using the equation of motion

of na [14]. this action is no longer invariant under gauge or vector gauge transformations.

but it is invariant under the brst transformations,

saa

sa = ha ,

sha

sna = a ,

sa = 0

sa = gf abcbc

s a = a ,

s a = 0

sa = gf abcbc  a .

(2.9)

these transformations are nilpotent, s2 = 0 on all elds, if s has a left action, i.e., the

change in any eld a is given by a = sa, where  is an anticommuting innitesimal

parameter. the tree-level quantum action of eqn.(2.8) is invariant under s, with a = sf a,

a = sf a and a = sf a. it is also possible to write this action as the sum of the classical

action s0 plus a total super-divergence,

s = s0 + s ,

with

 aha(cid:19) (cid:18)a

 (f a + na) +

2

 a

ha(cid:19) +(cid:16) af a +  aa(cid:17) .

(2.10)

in addition to the brst transformations, there is another brst-type nilpotent trans-

formation which leaves the action invariant. such a symmetry exists for all gauge theories,

not just the two-form theories, as can be seen from the following argument. the terms in

the extended ghost sector of the tree-level quantum action of a gauge theory are typically

of the form

sc
ext = haf a +

1
2

haha + aa ,

(2.11)

where (a, ha) are the trivial pairs. here the index a stands for the collection of various

indices as well as the space-time point where the elds are evaluated, f a = 0 is the corre-

sponding gauge-xing condition with gauge parameter , and a = sf a. the sum over a

includes the integration over space-time. this form of the extended ghost sector is valid for

commuting ha, f a and anticommuting a. for example, all but the last three terms of the

tree-level quantum action (2.8) can be written in this form, where the index a includes the

gauge index a or the pair (a, ) depending on the gauge eld (a or b). this part of the

action remains invariant under brst transformations

sa = ha ,

sha = 0 .

(2.12)

on the other hand, i can rearrange sc

ext as

sc

ext =

f af a + aa

f af a + aa

= haf a +

haha + aa ,

(2.13)

where i have dened ha = ha 

2


f a. so far, i have not actually done anything. the

only thing that comes out of this exercise is the fact that sc

ext is invariant under a new set

of brst transformations:

6

sa = ha  sa = ha +

f a ,

2

sf a ,

sha = 0  sha = 

2

sf a = a  sf a .

(2.14)

therefore, if the action of s on a and ha is as above, and s = s on all other elds, the last

equation is identically satised, and it also follows that s is nilpotent on all elds, s2 = 0 if

a does not contain any auxiliary eld, which is usually the case.

when the extended sector corresponds to an anticommuting gauge eld, as in the case of

gauge-xing of ghost elds, the construction is slightly more complicated, since the auxiliary

elds have odd ghost number. typically, for anticommuting auxiliary elds a, a, the

extended ghost sector can be written as

ext = af a + f aa +  aa + aa .
sa

(2.15)

in this, f a is the anticommuting gauge-xing function, a = sf a, and a is the corre-

sponding commuting antighost. the term f aa is just a rearrangement of the appropriate

terms in aa which appear for the usual gauge symmetries. a term such as f aa must

appear, since a is the ghost for some eld and therefore appears in some a. for example,

in the tree-level quantum action of eqn.(2.8) f aa corresponds to aa, which in turn

is required to cancel the brst variation of ha

na. just as in the case with commuting

auxiliary elds, the terms in sa

ext can be rearranged,

sa

ext =  a +
=   a +
=  a +

f a! a +
f a! 
f a! a +

f a! 
f a!  a +

f af a + aa

f af a + aa

=  aa + af a + f aa + aa .

(2.16)

where i have now dened a =   a +

f a! and a =  a +

2


f a!. as before, in

2


these coordinates sa

ext is invariant under its own set of brst transformations,

7

s a = a =  a +

f a!

2

2

2


s f a

sf a

sa = 0  sa = 

sa = 0  sa = 

sf a = a  sf a .

(2.17)

two more things are required for the nilpotence of s  a was the result of brst variation

of some eld (a = sna in eqn(2.9))  now a has to be the variation under s of the same

eld, and s f a must be calculated according to the rules of eqn.(2.14) for s acting on the

anticommuting ghosts in f a. in addition, the action of s must be the same as that of s for

the elds contained in f a. then s2 = 0 on all elds.

i can now gather the results of eqn.(2.14) and eqn.(2.17) and apply them to the tree-level

quantum action of eqn(2.8) to construct this symmetry,

sa = ha +

s = s on all other elds.

(2.18)

since the gauge-xing functions do not contain antighosts or auxiliary elds, and since

brst variations of the remaining elds also do not contain antighosts or auxiliary elds, a

straightforward calculation shows that s is nilpotent on all elds,

8

s2 = 0 .

(2.19)

in addition, since the classical action s0 is invariant under brst transformations, and since

s = s on the fundamental elds,

ss0 = 0 .

(2.20)

the remainder of the tree-level quantum action can be written as a sum of sc

ext and sa

ext as

dened above, and either by the method described above or by an explicit calculation it can

be shown quite easily that this part is also invariant under s. so in fact

ss = 0 .

(2.21)

it should be made clear that s is not special to the dynamical two-form, nor even to re-

ducible gauge systems. usual gauge theories exhibit invariance under a symmetry analogous

to s. but in those cases, this gauge-fermion dependent invariance is not needed for restrict-

ing the form of the quantum action  invariance under the familiar brst transformation s

is sucient for that purpose [12,13]. however, s becomes extremely useful when the theory

contains many dierent elds in the same representation, as in the case of the dynamical

two-form. i shall make extensive use of s to construct the quantum eective action for the

dynamical two-form. in order to do that, i need to look at the quantum symmetries corre-

sponding to s, s and some other classical symmetries of the theory. this is done in the next

section.

iii. symmetries of the effective action

on the way to a proof of perturbative renormalizability of the dynamical non-abelian

two-form, the rst thing to note is that there is no kinetic term for c a

 in the tree-level

action. consequently, c a

 is taken to be dimensionless. the auxiliary ghost eld  is taken

to be dimensionless for the same reason, and the theory is power-counting renormalizable.

the theory will be perturbatively renormalizable if and only if the quantum eective action,

9

invariant under the quantum symmetries, contains only those operators which appear in the

tree-level action of eqn. (2.8) up to arbitrary numerical coecients. the quantum action

can be constructed by use of the zinn-justin equation in the following manner.

the partition function z[j, k] in the presence of external c-number sources j a(x), k a(x)

is

z[j, k] =z hdbi exp(cid:18)is + iz d4xaj a + iz d4xf ak a(cid:19) ,

(3.1)

where f a(x) = sa(x). i shall also refer to k a as the antisource corresponding to the

eld a. this partition function leads to the eective action

[, k] = z d4xaj a

,k  i ln z[j,k, k] ,

(3.2)

where j a

,k is the value of the current for which hb(x)ij,k = b(x), the expectation value

being calculated in the presence of k a.

the eective action satises the zinn-justin equation [12,13],

(, ) = 0 ,

where the antibracket (f, g) is dened for any two functionals f and g as

(f, g) =z d4x

rf [, k]

a(x)

lg[, k]
k a(x)

z d4x

rf [, k]
k a(x)

lg[, k]

a(x)

.

(3.3)

(3.4)

in order to get a proof of perturbative renormalizability of a theory, the total action

functional s[, k] = s[] + r d4xf ak a is written as a sum of the renormalized action

sr[, k] plus a term s[, k] containing counterterms intended to cancel loop innities.

both sr and s must have the same symmetries as s[, k], so the innite contributions to

 can be cancelled by the counterterms in s if they also have those symmetries.

expanding  in a power series in the loop expansion parameter h,

[, k] =

xn =0

hn 1n [, k] ,

(3.5)

where 0[, k] = sr[, k], the zinn-justin equation can be written order-by order for each

n as

10

nxn =0

(n , n n ) = 0 .

(3.6)

this expansion automatically includes counterterms corresponding to sub-divergences at

any given loop order n. if for some n all innities appearing at m-loop order have been

cancelled by counterterms in s for all m  n 1, the only remaining innities in eqn.(3.6)

are in n . so the innite part n, of this quantity must satisfy

(sr, n,) = 0 .

(3.7)

for a theory which is renormalizable in the power-counting sense, this leads to a simple

mechanical procedure. for such a theory, the innite part n,[, k] must be a sum of

operators of mass dimension four or less.

in addition, all the linear symmetries of the

tree-level action are symmetries of [, k] and therefore of n,[, k].

let me assume for the moment that n,[, k] is at most linear in the antisources k a

for all a,

n,[, k] = n,[, 0] +z d4xfa

n [, x]k a(x) .

if i now dene the quantities

()
n [] = sr[, 0] + n,[, 0] ,

(3.8)

(3.9)

with  innitesimal, the terms independent of k a in eqn.(3.7) imply [13] that ()

n [] is

invariant under the transformation

where

sra(x) = f ()a

n (x) ,

f ()a
n (x) = f a(x) + fa

n (x) .

(3.10)

(3.11)

the terms of rst order in k a in eqn.(3.7) imply that this transformation is nilpotent,

r = 0. since n, contains only operators of mass dimension four or less, f ()a
s2

n (x) cannot

11

be of higher mass dimension than f a(x). in addition, f ()a

n (x) may not aect the linear

symmetries of the action. therefore, f ()a

n (x) must have the same lorentz properties, ghost

number and global gauge transformation properties as f a(x).

in fact f ()a

n (x) must be

the same as f a(x) if it corresponds to a eld which transforms linearly under s. all that

remains to be done is to construct the most general nilpotent transformation of the elds

under these restrictions, and then to construct the most general functional ()

n [] invariant

under this transformation. if that agrees, up to arbitrary constant numerical coecients,

with the original action s, the theory is perturbatively renormalizable.

this entire argument rests on the assumption that n,[, k] is at most linear in all of the

antisources k a. when is this a correct assumption? if a eld a has mass dimension da, the

corresponding k a must have mass dimension 3da so as to maker d4xf ak a dimensionless.

, na, a, a all have mass dimension 2. the

the antisources k a for aa

, a, a, ba

, a

, a

antisources for c a

 and a each have mass dimension 3. also, the theory does not have any

external antisource k a for the elds ha, ha

, a, a because their brst variations vanish.

therefore n, can be at most quadratic in k a.

if a eld a has ghost number a, the corresponding k a will have ghost number a 1.

it follows that the ghost number of the antisource for any of aa

, ba

, c a

, na is 1. the ghost

numbers of k a corresponding to a, a

 and a is 2, and those of k a corresponding to a
and a are 3 and +1, respectively. the remaining antisources correspond to a and a
,

they carry ghost number 0. the dimensions and ghost numbers of all the elds and their

antisources are given in table i at the end of this paper.

some of the quadratic terms can be eliminated straightaway. the brst variations of

the elds a, a

, na and a are linear, so the eective action cannot be quadratic in their

antisources. for example,

sa = ha,

so the quantum transformations are the same,

hsaij,k ,k = ha .

12

(3.12)

(3.13)

it follows from eqn.(3.2)that

r[, k]

k a[]

= ha ,

(3.14)

for the corresponding antisource k a[]. since this independent of k a, it follows that [, k]

is linear in the antisource for a. a similar argument holds for a

, na and a. let me

now look at the antisources for the remaining elds in the theory. the quantum eective

action [, k] must be linear in the antisources of a and c a

, since these objects have mass

dimension 3 and all other antisources have mass dimension 2. so [, k] is at most quadratic

in the antisources of only the other elds. with this in mind, i can write n,[, k] quite

generally as

n,[, k] = n,[, 0] +z d4x fa

n [, x]k a(x) +z d4x fab

n [, x]k a(x)k b(x) .

(3.15)

in this there is no k a corresponding to ha, ha

not run over the antisources for a, c a

, a, a

, a and a, and the quadratic sum also does
, na and a for reasons described above. the

relation (sr, n,) = 0, when applied to this expression, gives at zeroth order in k a

z d4x fa

(3.16)

(3.17)

here i have used the fact that fba

n = (1)ab fab

n where a, b are the grassmann parities

of k a and k b, 0 for bosonic k a and 1 for fermionic k a. the terms of second order in the

antisources lead to the equation

(3.18)

the coecient fab

n [, x] has mass dimension da+db2, and ghost number a+b+2, where

da and a are respectively the mass dimension and ghost number of the eld a. since a has

13

ghost number +1 and mass dimension zero, it is possible to construct functions of arbitrary

positive ghost number and mass dimension zero by taking products of a. therefore, fab
n

can depend only on a and c a

 for all a, b. and a must be present in fab

n to take care

of its ghost number, which is always positive since the quadratic sum runs only over the

antisources for the elds aa

, ba

, a, a

, a. so the rst term of eqn. (3.18), f c lfab

n /c,

must contain for all a, b,

(sa)

lfab
n
a = (gf abcbc  a)

lfab
n
a

.

(3.19)

the rst term on the right hand side will always appear in fac lf b/c because fac

contains a for all a, b, but the second will appear only if f a contains a. (the index n is

suppressed from now on.)

in the sum fac lf b/c, the only terms that contribute a a are for c corresponding

to aa

 when b is a

, and c corresponding to a when b is a. this implies, rst of all,

that at least one of the indices a, b in fab must correspond to either a

 or a. in other

words, when neither a, b corresponds to a

 or a, the sum fac lf b/c does not

contain a even after (anti-)symmetrization over a, b, while the sum f c lfab/c must

contain a. therefore fab = 0 for all such pairs a, b.

now, the only fac which contribute a a to the sum fac lf b/c are those for

which one index corresponds to one of (a

, a), and the other index to aa

 or a and all

these fac contain only products of a and c a

. looking at fab of this type, i nd that

each term which can contribute a a to the sum has a factor fac of the type that vanishes

by the previous argument. for example, if (a, b) correspond to (a, a), the only term in

the sum that could contribute a factor of a is fac(, ) lf b()/c, which vanishes since

fac(, ) = 0. explicitly, for this case eqn.(3.18) reads

z fac(, )

lf b()

c +z fac(, )

lf b()

c +z fac(, )

lf b()

c

+z f c()

lfab(, )

c

= 0 .

(3.20)

the rst term vanishes because fac(, ) = 0 by the previous argument, the second and

14

the third terms cannot contain a a, while the fourth term must contain only one factor of

a. since this is impossible, fab(, ) must also vanish. it follows by a similar argument

that fab = 0 when both indices correspond to a

 or a.

so the sum fac lf b/c vanishes for all (a, b), and therefore fab = 0 for all pairs

(a, b). it follows then that the eective action is at most linear in the antisources k a, and

the arguments following eqn.(3.7) hold. but the number of possible terms in the eective

action allowed by the (renormalized) brst symmetry sr is still enormous, and it is necessary

to invoke other symmetries to simplify calculations.

let me now consider the eect of the gauge-dependent symmetry s on the eective

action.

i take the same partition function z[j, k] and the same eective action [, k]

as in eqs.(3.1) and (3.2), with the same sources j a

,k and the same antisources k a. (this

[, k] was shown to be linear in these k a above.) let me also denote the minimal elds

by a and non-minimal elds by a. then sa = sa = f a, and consequently sf a[] = 0.

the application of s on the partition function gives (since the tree-level action s is invariant

under s),

z d4x"hf aij,k ,k

l[, k]

a

+ hsaij,k ,k

l[, k]

a

+ hssaij,k ,kk a[]# = 0 .

(3.21)

now, if the gauge-xing functions are linear in the elds, sa as dened in eqn.(2.18) is

either linear in the elds or equals the brst variation of some linear function of the elds.

therefore, hsaij,k ,k is known in principle from solving the zinn-justin equations. in ad-

dition, the eective action does not contain the antisources corresponding to (ha, ha

, a, a)
, na, a). then i can read o from eqn.(3.21)

and only sr contains the antisources for (a, a

that ()

n [] as dened in eqn(3.9) is invariant under sr, which is just s as calculated in terms

of sr. in other words, ()

n is invariant under sr where

(3.22)

sr = sr on all other elds.

note that i did not fully utilize the nilpotence of s itself. in principle, i could have treated

but that creates a host of other problems. in particular, the eective action is not linear in

s just like s, dening new antisources fk a and deriving an analogue of zinn-justin equation.
these new antisources fk a.

these two renormalized symmetries, sr and sr are sucient to uniquely x the form

of the eective action, as will be shown in the next section. there is a further symmetry

which helps to pin down the form of sr. this symmetry mixes the ghost elds with the

same global properties and quantum numbers.

the action s is invariant under

 a =  a ,

a

 =  (cid:16)a + gf abcab

c(cid:17) ,

a =  a ,

a = 

1
2

gf abcbc ,

(all others) = 0 ,

(3.23)

where  is a commuting c-number innitesimal. it is straightforward to calculate that

tsa =

1
2

gf abcbc,

ts(all others) = 0 ,

(3.24)

where t is the transformation /. note that i have taken  to be commuting only for

convenience. if  is taken to be anticommuting, the action will still be symmetric under

16

t = l/ provided l a/ = + a, other transformation rules remaining the same. it is

easy to see that the action s is symmetric under t for a large class f a.

by applying t on the partition function (3.1), i get the ward identities

z d4x htai

l
 a + hta
i

l
a


+ htai

l
a + htai

l

a  htsai k a[]! = 0 ,

(3.25)

where the quantum averages h i are calculated in the presence of the currents and antisources

j,k, k as before, and k a[] is the antisource for a. since ta = a, ta = a are linear

in the elds, their quantum averages are the same. as for the other two, ta

 = saa

 and

ta = sa, so the quantum averages of the quantities on the left hand side are known. i

can then write this equation as

(3.26)

(3.28)

where ()[] and f ()[] are as dened in eqs.(3.9) and (3.11) with the indices n and x

(3.30)

upon using tsa = 1

the interpretation of these equations is obvious. eqn.(3.28) says that ()

n [] is invariant

under tr, where

tr a = a ,

tra

 = sraa
 ,

tra = a ,

tra = sra ,

tr(all others) = 0 ,

(3.31)

the rst equation following that, eqn.(3.29), shows that trsr = 0 on all elds except a,

and eqn.(3.30) shows that trsra = sra. there are no surprises, except perhaps the

fact that these conditions are actually useful in restricting the form of sr to what is shown

in the appendix.

iv. the most general effective action

in this section i shall use brute force methods to show that the eective action contains

the same terms, up to arbitrary multiplicative renormalizations, as the tree-level action of

eqn.(2.8). the proof requires construction of the most general nilpotent transformation of

the elds, sr, as discussed in the previous section. the actual construction of sr is a rather

involved digression, so i have separated it into appendix a. the result of sr on the various

elds is given in eqn.(a32).

now i need to construct the most general functional ()

n symmetric under sr as well

as under the linear symmetries of s. these are (i) lorentz invariance, (ii) global su(n)

invariance, and (iii) ghost number conservation. however, it is obvious that even with

the restrictions imposed by sr and these three symmetries, there is an enormous number

18

of possible terms. since c a

 has mass dimension zero as well as ghost number zero, it is

possible to multiply any other term by a scalar polynomial of the form

(c a

c a), and still

npk=1

maintain the three abovementioned symmetries. of course, such terms are not sr-invariant

by themselves, but one can imagine that their variations cancel against those of something

else, and ruling out each such term requires a long and tedious calculation. and even without

this unwanted complexity, there are of the order of one hundred terms satisfying the three

linear symmetries. applying sr to a sum of so many terms, multiplied by unknown scalar

polynomials of c a

, and then nding the combination which remains invariant, would require

unlimited time and perseverance. fortunately, there is a way out of this quagmire, provided

by s.

as before, let me denote the minimal elds by a and non-minimal elds by a. let me

also dene s

r  1

2(sr  sr). then from eqn.(3.21),

ra = 0 , s
s

ra 6= 0 .

(4.1)

the non-minimal elds a are (a, a, a

, a, ha, a, ha

, na). let me also choose the gauge

xing functions to be specically those in eqn. (2.7). because of my choice of gauge-xing

functions, the action exhibits invariance under constant shifts of a, a, a

 and na. since

these are linear symmetries, i can impose them on the eective action. in other words, these

elds must appear in the quantum eective action only as derivatives, i.e., as  a etc.

then on dimensional grounds, the eective action will be at most quadratic in the a. i

can then write the eective action in the generic form

 =xa

ax a +xa,b

abx ab ,

(4.2)

where x a and x ab do not contain any of the a, and have appropriate transformation

properties, dimension and ghost number. in particular, x a and x ab are assumed to include

derivative operators as necessary for the constant shift symmetries mentioned above, and

the sum over indices will be taken to include an integral over space-time unless specied

otherwise. since both sr and sr are symmetries of the eective action, i have

19

and from eqn(4.1), i have

s
r = 0 ,

rx a = s
s

rx ab = 0 .

(4.3)

(4.4)

therefore using eqn.(4.2) i can write

xa

(s

ra)x a +xa,b

(s

ra)bx ab +xa,b

(1)aa(s

rb)x ab = 0 .

(4.5)

here a (not to be confused with the a of eqn.s(3.17) and (3.18)) is the grassmann parity

of the eld a. since x a and x ab do not contain any of the a by denition, i can now

look at the coecients of the various a in the expansion of eqn.(4.5) and set them to

zero in order to get an expression for the eective action . i will consider a in the order

(a, a, a

, a, ha, a, ha

, na). the eect of s

(4.6)

for each a i will rst consider coecients of terms containing ab in the expansion

of eqn(4.5). there can be no term of third or higher order in a in the eective action

because of the constant shift symmetries, and therefore the left hand side of eqn(4.5) can

be at most quadratic in the a. setting those coecients to zero will eliminate some of the

terms from the eective action and produce relations among some others. next i will follow

the same procedure for the terms linear in a. the terms not eliminated by all this will be

considered at the end.

terms containing products of the form ab in the expansion of s

r come from the

s
r-variation of

20

a bx ab

  + a bx ab

  + a bx ab

  + a b

x ab

  + ahb

x ab

h + anbx ab
n ,

(4.7)

where the subscripts   etc. indicate the quadratic combination which couples to a given x,

and an asterisk indicates the presence of a lorentz index on the subscript. in the rst term,

x ab

  has to be antisymmetric in [a, b]. therefore, the coecient of ahb in the expansion of

r gives x ab
s

  = 0. the coecients of a b, ahb

 and anb give

x ab

  = x ab

  = x ab

  = 0 ,

(4.8)

while the coecient of ab gives x ab

h = x ab

n . terms linear in a (and containing no

other a) come from

abx ab

 + ahbx ab

h + ( ahb

 + anb)x ab
n

the coecient of a in s

r is therefore



1


b

rx ab

 

1


b

rx ab

h +  1



f b  b

r! x ab

n = 0.

(4.9)

(4.10)

each of the xs in this equation must contain at least one derivative operator to allow for

the constant shift symmetry of a. therefore, the xs must be constructed only out of

elds of mass dimension zero. since the factors multiplying the xs are all dierent, and

have elds of non-vanishing mass dimension, the only choice for which this equation can be

satised is

x ab

 = x ab

h = x ab

n = x ab

h = 0 .

(4.11)

thus, all terms containing ab are excluded from the eective action.

terms containing ab arise from the terms

a bx ab

  + a b

x ab

  + a bx ab

  + ahb

x ab
h

+ anbx ab
n

(4.12)

as before, i set the coecients of the quadratic terms in the expansion to zero. the coe-

cients of a b, ahb

 and anb give

21

x ab

  = x ab

  = x ab

  = 0 ,

while the coecient of a b gives x ab
h

= x ab
n .

terms linear in a appear from the s

r-variation of

ahbx ab

h + abx ab

 (cid:16) ahb

 + anb(cid:17) x ab

the coecient of a in the variation of this is

1


b

rx ab

f b  b

r! x ab

n = 0 .

(4.13)

(4.14)

(4.15)

again each of the xs in this equation has mass dimension zero after excluding the derivative

operator they must contain to allow a constant shift in a. it is easy to see that the only

solution is

x ab

h = x ab

 = x ab

n = x ab
h

= 0 .

(4.16)

this, together with the previous result rules out all terms containing ab.

next are the terms containing a

b, which come from the variation of

 b
a

x ab

  + a

 bx ab

  + a

hb

x ab

h + a

(4.17)

as before, looking at the s

terms linear in a

(4.18)

(4.19)

the coecient of a

of this gives the relation

this equation contains x a

 which has non-vanishing mass dimension, so it an contain elds

other than a and c a

therefore, the xs appearing here must remain undetermined for the moment.

terms containing products of the form ab appear in the s

this equation is again insucient to determine the xs in it and will have to be reexamined

later.

h + ahbx ab

h + hahb

(4.25)

the other possibilities being known to vanish from the above analysis. the coecients of

x ab

h = x ab

x ab

hh = x ab
hn .

terms linear in ha come from

ax a

hh + habx ab

h + ha(cid:16)hb

 + nb(cid:17) x ab

(4.26)

(4.27)

of these, x ab

h has vanishing mass dimension and ghost number 1. since it is not possible

to construct such a function with the elds in the theory, it follows that x ab

h = 0. the

coecient of ha, in the terms linear in ha, in the variation of the rest satises the equation

(4.28)

these terms will also be left for later scrutiny, as this equation is insucient to determine

(4.29)

where i have excluded terms that have already been shown to vanish, and set

x ab

h = x ab

h = x ab

n = x ab

(4.30)

because these xs have negative ghost number and vanishing mass dimension, so cannot be

constructed out of elds present in the theory. the terms containing products of the form

where i have used the fact that both x ab

from

a

 .

(4.32)

of these, x a

 has ghost number 1, and must satisfy s

which cannot happen unless x a

lead to the equation

there is one more equation that can be obtained from s

(4.43)

i can now write the eective lagrangian for the ghost sector of the theory, after setting

to zero all the xs that were found to vanish in the analysis so far,

lg = ax a

hn + nanbx ab

(4.44)

just as the symmetry s

r = 0 produced relations among several of these xs, the quantum

brst symmetry itself, sr = 0, should produce some more relations independent of the

previous ones. the expression for the sr-variation is

sr =xa h(sra)x a + (1)aa(srx a)i

+xabh(sra)bx ab + (1)aa(srb)x ab + (1)a+bab(srx ab)i = 0. (4.45)

since srx a and srx ab cannot contain any of the a, i can consider the coecients of a

or of ab in the above expression and set them to zero.

the coecient of nab and hab give

x ab

nn = x ab

hn = 0 ,

while the coecients of ab, hahb, ha

hb

 and ha

nb give

srx ab

 = srx ab

hh = srx ab

hh = srx ab

hn = 0 .

26

(4.46)

(4.47)

now, each of the xs in this equation has zero mass dimension, zero ghost number and is

sr-invariant, so each must be a (possibly dierent) constant. let me dene four constants

k1, k2, k3 and k4 as

x ab

 = k1ab ,

x ab

hh = k2ab ,

x ab

hh = k3gab ,

x ab

hn = k 

4 ab .

the coecients of ha, a, ha

, a, a, a, a

 and na give the equations

 x a

 + srx a

h = 0 ,

x a

  srx a

 = 0 ,

x a

 + srx a

h = 0 ,

x a

n = 0 ,

srx a

 = srx a

 = srx a

 = srx a

n = 0 .

(4.48)

(4.49)

the last equation in this list is redundant as it can be obtained by applying sr to the

previous equations and remembering that s2

r = 0.the coecient of a

b gives srx ab

 = 0,

but x ab

 must contain a derivative operator to allow for the constant shift symmetry of a
.

so as with the functions in eqn.(4.47), x ab

 must be a constant times a derivative operator.

the coecient of ha

b in srlg shows that this constant is k 

4 , so i can write the ghost

sector lagrangian as

lg = ax a

 + ax a

 + a

x a

 + ax a

 + hax a

h + ha

x a

h

 k 

4  a

a + k1 aa + k2haha + k3ha

now i can use the unused equations from s
r

lg = 0. eqn.(4.24) now reads

x a

 

k1


a

r = 0 .

in keeping with standard notation, let me rewrite

k1 = z



x a

eqn.(4.28) now becomes

(4.50)

(4.51)

(4.52)

 x a

k2a

r = 0 .

as in the above, let me redene the constant,

k2 =

z



x a

r .

eqn.(4.20) becomes

1


x a

 

1


which gives upon using eqn.(4.52) that

k 

4 a

r = 0 ,

k 

4 = z g .

using this and eqn.(4.52) i can rewrite eqn.(4.36) as

(4.53)

(4.54)

(4.55)

(4.56)

z haa  z haa 

2


k3 haa + z haa = 0 ,

(4.57)

from which it follows that

k3 =

z .

(4.58)

this automatically satises eqn.(4.31). with these redenitions i get from eqn.(4.33) that

x a

h = zf a .

(4.59)

the right hand side vanishes upon using f a = ba . also, eqn.(4.38) can be written as

then eqn.(4.59) implies, because x a

h is a function of the elds and not an arbitrarily chosen

28

x a

h = 0 , and hence x a

 = 0 .

(4.62)

putting these into eqn.(4.43), i get x a

h = 0. therefore, i can now write down the general

form of the ghost sector of the theory as

i nd that the zinn-justin equation just says that the ghost-free sector is invariant under

these gauge transformations. the factor n6/n4 can be absorbed either in c a

 itself or in

the renormalization of a duciary coupling constant gc which always appears in front of c a
.

the procedure described so far can be used to construct eective actions for dierent

theories involving the non-abelian two-form. for example, it may be interesting to apply it

to the recently proposed rst-order formulation of yang-mills theory [15]. however, since i

have a specic theory in mind, i will need to invoke another symmetry in order to eliminate

unwanted terms from the non-ghost sector.

this symmetry was an invariance of the classical equations of motion under

29

ba

  ba

 + f a



(4.66)

with  a constant. it was suggested in [8] that this symmetry could play a role in preventing

terms of the form (b  dc)2 or (b  dc)  (b  dc) from appearing in the action. of

course, since the classical action is not invariant but changes by a total derivative, it is

nontrivial to elevate this to a quantum symmetry. classically this symmetry leads to a

conserved current

j 
t = h af a

 + m(aa

f a

 

2
3

f abcaa

) .

(4.67)

but there is no corresponding conserved current for the brst-invariant action s of

eqn.(2.8), which was the starting point of quantization. this part of the problem can

be circumvented quite easily by incorporating the shift into the brst transformation for

ba

, which now reads (cf. eqn.(2.9))

sba

 = gf abcbb

c + [a

] + gf abcab

[c

] + gf abcf b

c + f a
.

(4.68)

here  is an anticommuting constant with ghost number +1, and s = 0. it is trivial to

see that the brst transformation s is still nilpotent, s2 = 0. however, the action is still

not invariant, but is shifted by m

f a

. so it seems that i have not gained

anything, but only recovered a symmetry of the equations of motion. on the other hand,

4 r d4xf a

since i am now dealing with the quantum theory rather than the classical action principle,

i can also generate this term through quantum eects.

in particular, this term could be generated as a chiral anomaly if chiral fermions are cou-

pled to the gauge eld. under a chiral transformation with a parameter 42m, the eective

action changes by  m

f a

, which cancels the eect of the shift transformation

of eqn. (4.66). the action then becomes invariant under the combination of the shift and

4 r d4xf a

global chiral transformations. on the other hand, symmetry under the shift transformation

rules out terms involving products of (b d[c]). i can then write down the most general

quantum eective action consistent with the quantum symmetries,

30

e =z d4x(cid:16)za f a



f a + zb h a



h a + zbf mba

f a

 + lg(cid:17) .

(4.69)

this is the same as the tree-level action up to arbitrary multiplicative constants, which

means that the theory is perturbatively renormalizable.

v. discussion of results

it is time to gather the results. i have given an algebraic proof of perturbative renorma-

lizability of the dynamical non-abelian two-form gauge theory, also known as the topological

mass generation mechanism. it follows that just as in two and three dimensions, it is possible

in four dimensions to have a renormalizable theory of massive non-abelian vector bosons

without a residual higgs particle. chiral fermions were found to naturally arise in this model

as a way of restoring a classical shift symmetry in the quantum theory.

the calculations were done in a specic set of linear gauges, so that antighosts appeared

only as derivatives.

in other linear gauges, the calculations would be more involved, in

particular there would be terms cubic and quartic in the antighosts, but even in such cases

the methods of sec. iv should go through. two other symmetries appeared as a result of

using linear gauges  these are s, dened in eqn. (2.18), and t, dened in eqn. (3.23). these

two symmetries were greatly useful for constructing the quantum brst symmetry and for

reducing the number of possible terms in the quantum eective action. these symmetries

would be present in other linear gauges as well, but not in a general nonlinear gauge. the

calculations are extremely tedious for nonlinear gauges, and it is not clear if the quantum

brst symmetry alone is sucient to restrict the terms in the quantum eective action to

the same form as those in the tree-level action in such gauges.

the use of the anticommuting constant  can potentially create problems because it

has vanishing mass dimension, but ghost number +1, by eqn. (4.68). the fact that there

is an anticommuting constant in the theory is not in itself a problem. one place where

problems can arise is the argument in sec. iii that the quantum eective action is at most

linear in the antisources k a. the argument relied on the fact that the coecients of these

31

quadratic terms terms had vanishing mass dimension but non-vanishing ghost number, so

they must contain a. now a can be replaced by the constant . but there is no reason to

worry, because the relevant objects have ghost number +2 or more, so at least one a will be

needed to construct any of them, and the rest of the argument remains unchanged. another

possible place for a problem is in the calculation of the general nilpotent transformation

sr, given in the appendix. some of the elds a could have a term like a in their

transformation rules in principle. other similarly constructed terms are also possible. an

explicit calculation using the t symmetry shows that such terms do not arise.

i have not said much about adding fermions to the theory. it is an interesting feature of

the model that chiral fermions appear naturally and couple to the gauge eld to generate an

anomaly which cancels the eect of the shift symmetry. this line of argument breaks down

if all fermions are massive dirac fermions and there is no anomaly. there are other aspects

of adding fermions in the theory which will be discussed elsewhere.

the original motivation for the theory was to nd a possible alternative for the higgs

sector of the salam-weinberg model of electroweak interactions. what i have shown in

this paper is that it is possible to have massive vector bosons without spontaneous symme-

try breaking. but the problem with applying this mechanism to electroweak interactions

is precisely that there is no symmetry breaking, whereas the observed world has broken

su(2)u(1) symmetry. if i write the lagrangian for the salam-weinberg model without

the higgs eld, and add an su(2) two-form with an action as in eqn.(2.2), all the su(2)

gauge bosons get the same mass, contrary to experiment. all other observed events would

remain uncontradicted.

it has been suggested [11] that by also adding a u(1) two-form,

which would make the photon massive, it may be possible to get the correct mass ratio of

z and w particles. however, agreement with experiment requires an innite parameter in

the classical lagrangian, corresponding to an innite bare mass for the photon. another

way is to add an explicit symmetry breaking term to the lagrangian, so that the mass term

reads

32

m
4

(cid:16)ba

f a

  tan w b3

f(cid:17) ,

(5.1)

where f is the eld strength of the u(1) gauge eld, and w is the weinberg angle. then

by dening the z and photon elds as usual, i can write the quadratic part of this mass

term as



4

(cid:16)mb1

[a1

] + mb2

[a2

] + m sec w b3

(5.2)

[z](cid:17) .

it follows that the z is heavier than the w by a factor of sec w . however, because of the

explicit symmetry breaking term, the proof of renormalizability given here is not applicable.

so the question of applicability of this model to electroweak interactions remains open.

appendix a: renormalized brst transformation

i need to construct a generalized brst transformation of the elds. this is a nilpotent

transformation which aects the lorentz properties, ghost numbers and global gauge trans-

formation properties of the elds in exactly the same way as s of eqn(2.9) and is identical

with the latter where it is linear. let me calculate the generalized nilpotent transformation

sr for one eld at a time. for the elds which transform linearly under brst, this is the

same as the original s,

sr a = ha ,

srha = 0 ,

sr a

 = ha

srha

 = 0 ,

srna = a ,

sra = 0 ,

all other coecients in the expression of srba

 vanish identically as a result.

note that it is possible to consider other terms in sr which obey the zinn-justin equation

at rst order in the antisources. i have ignored such terms because they vanish upon using

the symmetry t. let me consider one example, that of a. the zinn-justin equation says

that

sfa[]  gf abcfb[]c = 0 .

on the other hand, from eqn.(3.29) for a, i have

tfa[] = 0 .

the only allowed possibility for fa[] is then

(a27)

(a28)

fa[] = 

1
2

g(dabc

2  f abc)bc + eabc( + d)b( + d)c ,

(a29)

where dabc

2

and eabc are now arbitrary. eqn.(3.30) gives

tfa[] + 2fa[] = 0 ,

(a30)

which immediately shows that eabc = 0, and i can write eqn. (a2) for the transformation

of a.

another byproduct of this equation is the somewhat unexpected relation

38

z n2 = 1 .

(a31)

similarly, i can use eqn.(3.29) to relate some of the constants previously found. from

trsra

 = 0, i nd n1 = n3, and from trsrc a

 = 0, i nd n5 = z n1n4. no other new

relation can be found this way.

the transformation rules can now be collected,
