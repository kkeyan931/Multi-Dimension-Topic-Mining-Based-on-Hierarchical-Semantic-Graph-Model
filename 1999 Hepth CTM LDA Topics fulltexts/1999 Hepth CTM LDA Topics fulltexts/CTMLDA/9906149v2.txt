abstract

we study conserved currents of any integer or half integer spin built from mass-
less scalar and spinor elds in ads3. 2-forms dual to the conserved currents in
ads3 are shown to be exact in the class of innite expansions in higher derivatives
of the matter elds with the coecients containing inverse powers of the cosmolog-
ical constant. this property has no analog in the at space and may be related to
the holography of the ads spaces.

1 introduction

the role of anti-de sitter (ads) geometry in the high energy physics increased greatly due
to the maldacena conjecture [1] on the duality between the theory of gravity in the ads
space and conformal theory on the boundary of the ads space [2, 3]. the holography
hypothesis suggests that the two types of theories are equivalent. the same time, ads
geometry plays very important role in the theory of higher spin (hs) gauge elds (for a
brief review see [4]) because interactions of hs gauge elds contain negative powers of
the cosmological constant [5]. the theory of hs gauge elds may be considered [4] as a
candidate for a most symmetric phase of string theory.

the group manifold case of ads3 is special and interesting in many respects. hs
gauge elds are not propagating in analogy with the usual chern-simons gravitational
and yang-mills elds, although the hs gauge symmetries remain nontrivial. the hs

currents can be constructed from the matter elds of spin 0 and spin 1/2. their couplings
to hs gauge potentials describe interactions of the matter via hs gauge elds.

schematically, the equations of motion in the gauge eld sector have a form r =
j(c; w ), where r = dw  w  w denotes all spin s  1 curvatures built from the
hs potential w , while c denotes the matter elds (precise denitions are given in the
sect. 2). to analyze the problem perturbatively, one xes a vacuum solution w0 that
solves r0 = 0, assuming that w = w0 + w1, while c starts from the rst-order part.
when gravity is included, as is the case in the hs gauge theories, w0 is dierent from
zero and describes background geometry. in the lowest nontrivial order one gets

r1  d0w1 = j2(c 2) ,

(1.1)

where d0 is built from w0 and the 2-form j2(c 2) dual to the 3d conserved current vector
eld obeys the conservation law

d0j2(c 2) = 0

(1.2)

on the free equations of motion of the matter elds.

a nonlinear system of equations of motion describing hs gauge interactions for the
spin 0 and spin 1/2 matter elds in ads3 in all orders in interactions has been formu-
lated both for massless [6] and massive [7] matter elds. an interesting property of the
proposed equations discovered in [7] is that there exists a mapping of the full nonlinear
system to the free one. this mapping is a nonlinear eld redenition having a form of
innite power series in higher derivatives of the matter elds and is therefore generically
nonlocal. the coecients of such expansions contain inverse powers of the cosmologi-
cal constant and therefore do not admit a at limit. we call such expansions in higher
derivatives pseudolocal. comparison of the results of [7] with (1.1) implies that such a
eld redenition exists in a nontrivial model if

j2(c 2) = d0u(c 2) ,

(1.3)

where u is some pseudolocal functional of the matter elds. the cohomological interpre-
tation with d0 as de rahm dierential is straightforward because d2
0 = r0 = 0. indeed,
from (1.2) it follows that the current j2(c 2) should be closed on the free equations for
matter elds, while (1.3) implies that it is exact in the class of pseudolocal functionals.
this fact has been already demonstrated for the spin 2 current in [7], where we have
found a pseudolocal u for the stress tensor constructed from a massless scalar eld. in
this paper, we generalize this result to the currents of an arbitrary integer or half integer
spin.

exact currents with local u containing at most a nite number of derivatives of the
matter elds reproduce improvements, i.e., modications of the currents which are
trivially conserved. the new result about ads space established in this paper is that the
true currents can also be treated as improvements in the class of pseudolocal expansions.
this sounds very suggestive in the context of the holography hypothesis.

the paper is designed as follows. in sect. 2 we collect some facts about the equations
of motion of the chern-simons hs gauge elds and the unfolded formulation of the
equations of motion for the massless spin 0 and 1/2 matter elds in ads3.
in sect. 3
we propose a formalism of generating functions to describe dierential forms bilinear in

2

derivatives of the matter elds. then, in sect. 4 we formulate using this method the ads
on-mass-shell complex and study currents of an arbitrary spin.

2 higher spin and matter fields in ads3

the 3d hs gauge elds are described [8, 6] by a spacetime 1-form w = dxw(y, |x)
depending on the spacetime coordinates x ( = 0, 1, 2), auxiliary commuting spinor
variables y (indices  ,  ,  = 1, 2 are lowered and raised by the symplectic form  =
, 12 = 12 = 1, a = a, a = a), and the central involutive element ,

w(y, |x) =



xn=0

1

2in! h, (n)(x) +  h, (n)(x)i y1 . . . yn .

(2.1)

a constant parameter  is to be identied with the inverse radius of ads3.

the hs gauge algebra is a lie superalgebra built via (anti)commutators from the
associative algebra spanned by the elements a(y, ) with the product law  dened via
the generating relations y  y  y  y = 2i, y   =   y,    = 1. (the
boson-fermion parity  is dened in a usual way as a(y, ) = ()(a) a(y, ).) the
eld strength is [9, 8] r(y, |x) = dw (y, |x)  w (y, |x)  w (y, |x). the role of
the element  is to make the 3d hs superalgebra semisimple (hs(2)  hs(2), where, in
notation of [9], hs(2) is a superalgebra spanned by the -independent elements a(y)), with
simple components singled out by the projectors p = 1
2(1  ). this is similar to the
ads3 isometry algebra o(2, 2)  sp(2)  sp(2). the latter is identied with a subalgebra
of hs(2)  hs(2) spanned by l = 1
2i yy. we therefore identify the
o(2, 2) components of w (y, |x) (2.1) with the gravitational lorentz connection 1-form
(x) = dx,
(x). since ads3 algebra
o(2, 2) is a proper subalgebra of the d3 hs algebra it is a consistent ansatz to require the
vacuum value of w (y, |x) to be non-zero only in the spin 2 sector. then the equation
r0 = 0 is equivalent to the o(2, 2) zero-curvature conditions

(x) and the dreibein 1-form h(x) = dxh,

the inverse dreibein h

equation in (2.2) reduces to the zero-torsion condition which expresses lorentz connection
, where r

is the riemann tensor 2-form. therefore, the equations (2.2) describe ads3 with radius
1.

the unfolded formulation [10] of the equations (2.3) in the form of some covariant
constancy conditions is most convenient for the analysis of cohomology of currents. to
this end one introduces an innite set of symmetric multispinors c1...n for all n  0.
(we will assume total symmetrization of indices denoted by the same letter and will use
the notation c(n) = c1...n when only a number of indices is important.) as shown in
[10], the innite chain of equations

dlc(n) =

i

2 hhc(n)  2n(n  1) hc(n2)i ,

(2.4)

where dl is the background lorentz covariant dierential, dlc(n) = dc(n)+n 
is equivalent to the equations (2.3) for the lowest rank components c and c along with
some constraints expressing highest multispinors via highest spacetime derivatives of c
and c. for example, for bosons

c(n1),

c(2n)(x) = (2i)n h1

, h2

,  . . . hn

,  12 . . . n c(x) ,

(2.5)

where  is a full background derivative (for multispinors c(n) = dl

 c(n)).

following [10], let us introduce the generating function

c(y, |x) =

(1)[ n

2 (c) c( 1

(2.6)

where [n + a] = n, n  z and 0  a < 1, and the boson-fermion parity (c) = 0(1) for
even (odd) functions c(y). the equations (2.4) can be rewritten in the form [10],

dlc(y, ) =

y  yy# c(y, ) ,

dl = d  y


y .

(2.7)

the elds c1...n are identied with all on-mass-shell nontrivial derivatives of the matter
elds according to (2.5). the condition that the system is onmassshell is encoded in
the fact that the multispinors c1...n are totally symmetric. this allows us to work with
c1...n instead of explicit derivatives of the matter elds. consider a function f [c(n)(x)]
of all components of c1...n(x) at some xed point x. f is not supposed to contain any
derivatives with respect to the spacetime coordinates x and therefore looks like a local
function of matter elds. one has to be careful however because, when the equations
(2.4) hold, (2.5) is true. we will therefore call a function f [c(n)] pseudolocal if it is an
innite expansion in the eld variables c(n)(x) and local if f is a polynomial. in terms
of the generating functions c(y, |x) this can be reformulated as follows. let f (c|x) be
some functional of the generating function c(y, |x) at some xed point of spacetime x.
according to (2.5) its spacetime locality is equivalent onmassshell to the locality in the
y space. indeed, from (2.7) it follows that the derivatives in the spinor variables form in
a certain sense a square root of the spacetime derivatives.

the equation (1.1) for the d3 hs system reads (in the rest of the paper we use the

symbol d instead of d0)

dw1(y, |x) = j(c 2)(y, |x)

(2.8)

with the background ads covariant dierential

d = dl   h y


y = d  ( +  h) y


y .

(2.9)

that (x) and h(x) obey the equations (2.2) guarantees d2 = 0. thus, our problem
is to study the cohomology of d (2.9). clearly, d commutes with the euler operator
n = y 
y . its eigenvalues are identied with spin s via n = 2(s  1). the problem
therefore is to be analyzed for dierent spins independently.

conserved currents of an arbitrary integer spin in d4 minkowski spacetime were con-

sidered in [11]. for d = 2, hs conserved currents were constructed in [12].

in the case of ads3, conserved currents of any integer spin s  1 built from two

massless scalar elds c, c  have a form

j (s)
, (2s2)(c, c ) =

(2.10)

analogously, one can write down the currents of any integer spin s  1 built from two
massless spinors, and the supercurrents of any half integer spin s  3/2 built from one
scalar and one spinor [13]. the lowest spin conserved currents read

j (1)
 (c, c ) = h,

) = h,

(2.11)

(2.12)

(2.13)

these currents are all local, containing a nite number of terms (i.e., higher derivatives
(2.5)). the same expressions remain valid in the at limit with    in (2.5).

3 generating functions

to analyze the cohomology problem for currents of an arbitrary spin we rst elaborate a
technique operating with the generating functions (2.6) rather than with the individual
multispinors. a generic lorentz covariant spacetime 1-form of spin s = n/2 + 1 bilinear
in two dierent matter elds c and c  and their onmassshell nontrivial derivatives is

where aklm, bklm
1,2,3 are arbitrary constants and h is the dreibein 1-form. in-
troducing (y, |x) = 1...n(|x) y1 . . . yn, one can equivalently rewrite this formula
as

(y, |x) = h

(3.2)

here r, s, and  are complex variables, u and v ( = 1, 2) are spinor variables. the
quantities fi(r, s,  ), i = 1, . . . , 6 are polynomials in r1 and s1 and formal series in  1,



fi(r, s,  ) = x0<k, l<p,

inserting (2.6) into (3.2) and completing elementary integrations one arrives at (3.1)

with the coecients aklm, bklm

1,2 , and eklm

1,2,3 expressed via fi(k, l, m). for example,

aklm =

()k+mim

k! l! m!

(1)[ k+m

2

]+[ l+m

2 ] f1(k + 1, l + 1, m + 1) .

(3.4)

therefore (3.2) indeed describes a general lorentz covariant 1-form bilinear in the mat-
ter elds. note that the formula (3.2) produces a spacetime local expression if all the
coecients fi contain a nite number of terms in (3.3) and pseudolocal if some of the
expansions in negative powers of  are innite.

in practice, the following representations of rank n = 0, 1, 2, 3 dierential forms n(x)

(using the same notations for their eigenvalues). the quantities r1,2(z, z,  ), w1,2(z, z,  ),
w1,2(z, z,  ), y1,2(z, z,  ), y1,2(z, z,  ), v1,2(z, z,  ), and e0,3(z, z,  ) give a non-zero contri-
bution to (3.5) and (3.6) when n, n, and n satisfy the following restrictions:

beyond these regions, the coecients do not contribute and therefore their values can
be xed arbitrarily. as a result, the quantities r1,2, w1,2, w1,2, ... are dened modulo

arbitrary polynomials p ( ) = pk0

k=0 pk k.

for the two-component spinors, antisymmetrization over any three two-component
spinor indices gives zero. this is expressed by the identity a(bc)+b(ca)+c(ab) =
0 valid for any three commuting two-component spinors a, b, and c. as a result, the
forms discussed so far are not all independent. the ambiguity in adding any terms which
vanish as a consequence of this identity can be expressed in a form of some equivalence
(gauge) transformations of the coecients in (3.2) and (3.6). we call these equivalence
transformations fierz transformations. using the partial integrations w.r.t.  , z, and z,
one can check that the transformations

r1,2 =  1,2 ,
v1,2 = i(n1,2  n1,2) ,

y1,2 = i(n  1)1,2 ,

 y1,2 = i(n  1) 1,2

w1,2 =  1,2 + 2in1,2 ,

 w1,2 =  1,2  2in1,2 ,

with arbitrary parameters 1,2(z, z,  ), 1,2(z, z,  ), and 1,2(z, z,  ) describe all possible
fierz transformations of the 1- and 2-forms (3.6).

4 on-mass-shell current complex

in this section we study the onmass-shell action of the operator d (2.9) on the dierential
forms dened in sect. 3. the advantage of the formulation of the dynamical equations
in the unfolded form (2.7) is that it expresses the spacetime derivative of c via some
operators acting in the auxiliary spinor space. as a result, onmassshell action of d
reduces to some mapping d acting on the coecients in the formulae (3.5)-(3.6).

let us consider the example of a 0-form. using the leibnitz rule for dl and taking into
account the equations of motion (2.7) and the zero torsion condition dlh = 0 (2.2), one
arrives at the 1-form 1 = d0 with the coecients rd

respectively with the replacements i  i, n  n, w1  w1, and y1  y1 on r.h.s.-

reformulation of the problem in terms of (t, d) eectively accounts the fact that the
elds are onmassshell. we identify the cohomology of currents with the cohomology of
d.

the remarkable property of the mapping d is that it contains z, z, 

 z only via n
and n (3.7), thus implying the separation of variables: the dierential d leaves invariant
eigensubspaces of n and n.
in fact, this is the main reason for using the particular
represenation (3.5)-(3.6).

following [11] we study the currents containing the minimal possible number of space-
time derivatives for a given spin s. from (2.5) it is clear that this is the case if the number
of the contracted indices  in (3.1) is zero. since the number of contractions is (n + 1)
(see sect. 3) we consider 2-forms n,n

2 with n = 1. thus we set in (3.6)

r2 = r(n, n) zn z n 1 , w2 = w (n, n) zn z n 1 ,
y2 = y (n, n) zn z n 1 ,

y2 =  y (n, n) zn z n 1 ,

w2 =  w (n, n) zn z n 1 ,

v2 = v (n, n) zn z n 1

is closed as a consequence of (3.8).

our problem is to investigate whether there exist coecients r1, w1, ... such that
2 , ... have a form (4.7). to this end one has to solve the system (4.2)-(4.5) in

 y1 = i(n  1) 1 .

w1 =  1 + 2in1  2(1  i ) ,

v1 = 2(1 +  2)  i(n1  n 1) ,

(4.9)

we consider separately two cases: (i) with n = 1, n = 1  2s or n = 1, n = 1  2s and
(ii) with n < 1 and n < 1. as shown below, the case (i) corresponds to the nontrivial
physical conserved currents, whereas the case (ii) describes all possible improvements.
let us start with the case (i) setting for deniteness n = 1. according to (3.8), y2 is
the only coecient giving a non-zero contribution to n,1
2 (y). obviously, a 2-form with
n = 1 is invariant under the transformations (3.9). the only non-trivial equation is (4.5).
with y d

(4.7) it takes the form

(4.10)

modulo terms polynomial in  . it is not hard to see that a generic solution of (4.10) is

y1(z, z,  ) =

+  z12s z (1  i )(1 + i )2s1 ln  1 + i 1

1  i 1! + q( ) ,

(4.11)

where  is an arbitrary constant and q( ) is some inessential polynomial. the logarithms
are treated as power series in  1.

at any , the solution (4.11) is an innite series in  1, thus corresponding to some
2(y|x) constructed with the polynomials y2 at

pseudolocal 1-form. thus, the 2-forms s

9

1(y|x). we therefore argue that the 2-form s

n = 1 and with y2 at n = 1 are d-closed and cannot be represented as ds
1(y|x) with a
spacetime local s
2(y) describes a physical
conserved current of spin s. the currents (2.10) as well as the currents containing fermions
are reproduced via y2 (4.7) with y (1  2s, 1) = 22s1 ()[s]. the formula (4.11) solves
the problem of reformulation of the physical currents as pseudolocally exact 2-forms.
note that the currents generated by y2(n = 1  2s, n = 1) and y2(n = 1, n = 1  2s) are
equivalent by the interchange c  c .

note that the solution (4.11) is not unique, containing an arbitrary parameter . since
the transformations (4.9) are trivial for y1 at n = 1, this one-parametric ambiguity cannot
be compensated this way. this means that we have found a pseudolocal 1-form that is
d-closed but not d-exact, i.e., the cohomology group h 1(t, d) is nontrivial. this fact is
in agreement with the one-parametric ambiguity found in [7] for the spin 2 case.

let us now consider the case of n < 1, n < 1. substituting (4.7) into the system
(4.2)-(4.5) one can see that, if the conditions (4.8) guaranteeing that 2 is d-closed are
satised, then it admits the following solution,

w1(z, z,  ) =

zn z n 1 ,

v1 = y1 = y1 = 0 .(4.13)

we observe that the 1-form n,n
1 (y) leads to a spacetime local expression since r1, w1,
and w1 (4.12), (4.13) are linear in  1. therefore, n,n
1 (y|x) with some
local n,n
1 (y|x). thus, it is an improvement of the physical current 2-form j(c 2) on the
r.h.s. of (2.8), which can be compensated by a local eld redenition of the (hs) gauge
elds.

2 (y|x) = dn,n

to investigate what happens in the at limit   0 one should use the generating
function c(y) (2.6) instead of c(y). a simple analysis show that in terms of c(y) the
solution (4.11) contain an inverse power of  together with each power of  1. hence,
a representation of physical current 2-forms s
1(y) becomes
meaningless in the at limit.

2(y) as some dierentials ds

conclusion

it is shown that local conserved currents of an arbitrary spin in ads3 can be treated as
improvements within the class of innite power expansions in higher derivatives, i.e.,
2-forms j dual to the physical conserved currents are shown to be exact in this class,
j = du. the 1-forms u are constructed explicitly what allows us to write down nonlocal
eld redenitions compensating matter sources in the equations of motion for the chern-
simons gauge elds of all spins. the coecients in the expansion of u in derivatives of the
matter elds contain negative powers of the cosmological constant (i.e. positive powers
of the ads radius) and therefore do not admit a at limit. the existence of u may be
related to the holography in the ads/cft correspondence since it indicates that local
current interactions in ads3 are in a certain sense trivial and can, up to some surface
terms, be compensated by a eld redenition. we expect similar phenomenon to take
place for adsd with any d.
