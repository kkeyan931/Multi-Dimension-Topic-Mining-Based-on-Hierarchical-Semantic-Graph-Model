abstract

for the description of space-time fermions, dirac-kahler elds (inho-

mogeneous dierential forms) provide an interesting alternative to the

dirac spinor elds. in this paper we develop a similar concept within

the symplectic geometry of phase-spaces. rather than on space-time,

symplectic dirac-kahler elds can be dened on the classical phase-

space of any hamiltonian system. they are equivalent to an innite

family of metaplectic spinor elds, i.e. spinors of sp(2n ), in the same

way an ordinary dirac-kahler eld is equivalent to a (nite) mulitplet

of dirac spinors. the results are interpreted in the framework of the

gauge theory formulation of quantum mechanics which was proposed

recently. an intriguing analogy is found between the lattice fermion

problem (species doubling) and the problem of quantization in general.

1 introduction

in a classic paper [1] e. kahler proposed a description of fermions in terms of

inhomogeneous dierential forms. rather than by spinor elds, the fermions

are represented by a set of antisymmetric tensors in this approach. the role of

the dirac equation is taken over by the so-called dirac-kahler equation which

involves only tensor manipulations. it imitates the  - matrix algebra with the

help of the cliord product for forms.

at rst sight it seems puzzling how a family of tensor elds carrying integer

spin can describe a particle of half-integer spin. this paradox is resolved if one

notes that (in 4 space-time dimensions) a single dirac-kahler eld actually

corresponds to a multiplet of 4 ordinary dirac spinors which mix under lorentz

transformations in a nontrivial way (avor mixing).

the dirac-kahler fermions have attracted a lot of attention both from the

physics [2] - [9] and the mathematics [10, 11] point of view. in particular they

made their appearance in lattice eld theory [12]. it is a well known problem

that a straightforward lattice discretization of the ordinary dirac action does

not describe one but rather 16 fermions in the continuum limit. the reason for

this replication of fermionic states (usually refered to as the species doubling

problem) is that the lattice propagator in momentum space has poles at all

16 corners of the brillouin zone. the kogut-susskind [13] or staggered lattice

fermions were proposed as an attempt to solve this problem. they are based on

a more sophisticated lattice action which reduces the number of fermion species

from 16 to 4. later on it turned out [2, 3] that the kogut-susskind fermions

are nothing but dirac-kahler elds discretized on a hypercubic lattice. as it

deals with dierential forms only, dirac-kahler theory on the lattice can take

advantage of all the mathematical tools provided by the algebraic topology

of cell complexes.

in particular, by a standard procedure, the dierential

forms of the continuum formulation can be replaced by appropriate cochains

2

on the lattice. these cochains are functions dened on the lattice points, links,

plaquettes, cubes and hypercubes of the underlying lattice. in this manner it

becomes obvious that the extra fermion species implied by the kogut-susskind

lattice action and the fact that a dirac-kahler eld contains 4 ordinary dirac

fermions have a common origin.

we only mention that the species doublers on the lattice can be avoided

completely by using wilson fermions or the nonlocal slac derivative [12],

for instance. alternatively one can regard the 4 dirac fermions contained in

one kogut-susskind eld as 4 dierent physical avors. as we are interested

in dirac-kahler fermions here we shall adopt this latter point of view in the

following.

dirac-kahler (dk) elds can be dened on any riemannian1 manifold

(mn, g), i.e. on any smooth n-dimensional manifold equipped with a met-

ric g. from the physics point of view this manifold represents space-time.

the main purpose of the present paper is to propose an analog of the

dk-elds which live on symplectic rather than riemannian manifolds. this

means that we are going to study dk-elds not over space-time but rather

over a phase-space.

which is endowed with a closed, nondegenerate 2-form  = 1

a symplectic manifold (m2n , ) is a smooth 2n-dimensional manifold
2a bda  db.
(the a, a = 1, ..., 2n , are local coordinates on m2 n .) this manifold should

be thought of as the phase-space of a hamiltonian system with n degrees of

freedom. the corresponding poisson bracket is given by {a, b} = a b where

the matrix (a b) is the inverse of (a b). using local darboux coordinates a 

(pi, qi), i = 1, ..., n, this matrix is independent of a, qp = pq = i, and the

only nonvanishing brackets are {qi, pj} = i j. if a andea are local coordinates

belonging to two overlapping charts of an atlas covering m2n then, by the

1the pseudo-riemannian case (lorentzian space-times) can be dealt with in a completely

analogous fashion.

is symplectic, i.e.

very denition of a symplectic manifold, the coordinate transformation   e
the jacobian matrix (ea/b) is an element of sp(2n)

at every point of the overlap region. sp(2n), the group of linear canonical

transformations, plays the same role for phase-space which the lorentz group

plays for space-time. in particular, it is the structure group of the frame bundle

over m2 n .

as for introducing dk-elds on symplectic manifolds the rst question

which we must answer is what kind of spinor eld should be used in place of

the ordinary dirac spinors of relativistic eld theory. the only natural choice

here is to employ the so-called metaplectic spinors [14], i.e.

the spinors of

the metaplectic group mp(2n). basically mp(2n) is related to sp(2n) in

the same way spin(n) is related to so(n). in particular, there exists a two-

to-one homomorphism between the two groups, i.e. mp(2n) covers sp(2n)

twice. the construction of metaplectic spin bundles and spinor elds over a

symplectic manifold proceeds almost literally along the same lines as in the

case of space-time spinors, the main dierence being that it is mp(2n) now

which serves as the structure group. for a detailed exposition we must refer

to the literature [14, 15].

metaplectic spinors have been used in many dierent contexts including

geometric quantization [15], semi-classical approximations [16], parisi-sourlas

super-symmetry [17], string theory [18, 19], and anyon super-conductivity [20].

most recently they played an important role in an approach to quantization

[21] which is based upon a yang-mills theory on phase-space with metaplectic

matter elds. this new formulation of quantum mechanics is one of the

main motivations for the present work. we shall come back to it later on.

let us briey describe how one can construct representations of mp(2n)

[22]. one has to associate an operator m(s) to every matrix s  (sa

b) 

sp(2n) in such a way that m(s1)m(s2) = m(s1s2). these operators can

be built up from a kind of -matrices which constitute a symplectic cliord

4

algebra:

ab  ba = 2 i a b

(1.1)

we require m(s) to satisfy the usual compatibility condition between the

vector and the spinor representation:

m(s)1am(s) = sa

bb

(1.2)

every innitesimal sp(2n)-transformation is of the form sa

b+accb with
symmetric coecients ab. inserting this together with the ansatz m(s) =

b = a

meta into the compatibility condition it is easy to show that the latter

1  i

2 abab
is solved by

ab

meta =

1
4

(ab + ba)

(1.3)

and that these generators satisfy the sp(2n) commutator relations [22]. thus

every representation of the symplectic cliord algebra gives rise to a represen-

tation of mp(2n).

the most obvious dierence between the metaplectic and the space-time

spinors is that the symplectic cliord algebra involves a commutator rather

than an anticommutator. as an immediate consequence, this algebra has no

nite dimensional matrix representations, and metaplectic spinors are neces-

sarily innite component objects. what is meant by a metaplectic represen-

tation is a representation in which a is a hermitian operator on an innite

dimensional hilbert space v. hence the operators m obtained by exponenti-

ating the generators (1.3) give rise to a unitary representation. (see [22, 23],

for further details.)

the symplectic cliord algebra (1.1) admits a rather intriguing reinter-

pretation which is also at the heart of the new approach to quantization [21]

mentioned above. assume we are given a quantum mechanical system with

a hilbert space v along with n position and momentum operatorsbxi andbi

5

acting on it. they satisfy the canonical commutator relations [bxi,bj] = i  ij.
by virtue of the identication i = bi,
n +i = bxi for i = 1, ..., n and with
the constant   p2/ it is obvious that the symplectic cliord algebra
(1.1) is actually nothing but the canonical commutation relations for thebx-b-

auxiliary quantum system. we call it an auxiliary system because it should

not be confused with the actual physical system under consideration, the one

whose (curved) phase-space is m2n . (the classical phase-space pertaining to

the auxiliary system is simply r2n equipped with the standard symplectic

structure.)

the metaplectic spin bundles are bundles over m2n with the typical ber

v and the structure group mp(2n) [14]. at each point  of m2n a local copy

of v, denoted v, is attached. metaplectic spinor elds are sections through

these bundles. locally they are simply functions which assume values in v:

 : m2n  v,

 7 |i  v

(1.4)

the notation |i means that the spinor |i  v, lives in the local hilbert

space at . upon introducing a basis {|i} in v we write ()  h|i for its

components. here  is an innite dimensional generalization of a spinor index.

if we take {|i} to be the bx-eigenbasis, for instance, then   (1, ..., n ) 

rn . (see [22, 23] for details.)

in the present paper we shall focus on the local aspects of the bundles

involved. we only mention that on certain manifolds there are topological

obstructions which prevent them from carrying globally well dened metaplec-

tic spinor elds [14].

in ref.

[23] we characterized these obstructions using

methods from quantum eld theory.

let us come back to the main question which we are trying to answer in

this paper: do there exist symplectic dirac-kahler elds which are related

to the metaplectic spinors in the same way the ordinary dirac-kahler elds

are related to dirac spinors?

6

apart from being interesting in its own right, this question is of obvious

physical relevance. the fascinating property of metaplectic spinor elds is

that, on a purely group theoretical basis, they introduce aspects of quantum

mechanics into the geometry of classical phase-spaces. by pure representation

theory one is led to the auxiliary quantum system in the local hilbert spaces

v. in ref. [21] we explained in detail how these auxiliary systems relate to the

actual physical quantum system with the classical phase-space m2n . using

this as our starting point, we showed that it is possible to replace conventional

canonical quantization by two new rules with a more transparent physical and

geometrical meaning.

classical mechanics and classical statistical mechanics are geometric theo-

ries which are conveniently described in the language of symplectic geometry.

only tensor elds are needed to formulate them. quantum mechanics, on the

other hand, has a natural interpretation in terms of spinor elds on phase-

space. thus, in a sense, the very process of quantization is tantamount to

a transition from tensors to spinors. but this is precisely what dirac-kahler

theory is about: its basic elds are tensors which, however, are equivalent to

a multiplet of spinors.

before embarking on the detailed constructions let us briey outline the

strategy for nding the symplectic dk-elds which we shall follow in this

paper.

our main tools are two types of auxiliary quantum systems with hilbert

need a similar fermionic system with a (nite-dimensional) hilbert space v f

on v whose canonical operators realize the metaplectic -matrices a. we also

spaces v and v f, respectively. we mentioned already the (bosonic)bx-b-system
and a set of operatorsb,  = 1, ..., n, satisfying the canonical anticommutator
relations bb +bb = . the so(n)-dirac matrices  are treated as a

special realization of this algebra.

an important technical ingredient is the weyl symbol calculus [24]-[28]. let

7

l(v) and l(v f) be the spaces of linear operators on v and v f, respectively.

it is possible to uniquely characterize every operatorbb  l(v) and bf  l(v f )

in terms of classical phase-functions (symbols) b(y) and f (). here y and  are

coordinates on the (at) classical phase-spaces which belong to the auxiliary

systems.

in the bosonic case, y  (ya)  r2n is a vector with commuting

entries, while   () is a set of n anti-commuting grassmann numbers.

the space of all bosonic (fermionic) symbol functions, equipped with certain

algebraic structures, is referred to as the bosonic (fermionic) weyl algebra

w(w f).

given a space-time manifold mn, we consider elds on this manifold which

assume values in v f, l(v f) and w f, respectively. in an obvious notation, we

denote them (x),bf (x), and f (x, ).
similarly, given a phase-space manifold m2n , we dene elds (),bb(),

and b(, y) which assume values in v, l(v) and w, respectively.

in the rst part of this paper we shall reformulate standard dirac-kahler

theory in terms of the fermionic weyl symbol calculus. we shall see that (x)

is an ordinary dirac spinor and that f (x, ) can be identied with a dk-eld.

the grassmann variables  will play the role of the basis dierentials dx.

this rst part of the investigation is quite interesting in its own right.

for instance, we shall discover that the cliord product which is at the heart

of dk-theory is basically the same thing as the star product of the fermionic

weyl symbol calculus. as a consequence, w f turns out to be an atiyah-kahler

algebra [10, 11].

in the second part of this paper we investigate in detail what happens to

the standard dk-theory, reformulated in terms of fermionic weyl symbols,

when we replace fermionic symbols by bosonic ones everywhere. this means

that we switch from the b- to the bx-b-system. then () is a metaplectic

spinor eld, and by analogy with the fermionic setting we shall argue that

b(, y) is the symplectic dk eld which we are looking for. schematically

8

our approach can be summarized as follows:

dk  elds  fermionic symbols



symplectic dk  elds  bosonic symbols

(1.5)

the rest of this paper is organized as follows: in the second half of this

introduction we discuss some aspects of standard dk-theory which will be

important later on. then, in section 2, we reformulate this theory in terms

of fermionic weyl symbols. particular attention is paid to the decomposition

of dk-elds as a set of dirac spinors. the construction of the symplectic

dk-elds is performed in section 3. we investigate in detail which properties

of so(n) dk-elds can be translated to the sp(2n)-case and which cannot.

section 4 contains a summary and various remarks on the quantization problem

in the light of the present work. some material needed as a background for

section 2 is relegated to the appendix.

as for its mathematical rigor, the style of this paper is informal. occasion-

ally the language of ber bundles is used as a convenient tool but we are mostly

interested in the local properties of the bundles involved and no pretense is

made as for a rigoros and complete discussion of the global aspects.



dk elds on space-time 

let us start with an arbitrary (curved) n-dimensional riemannian manifold

(mn, g). upon introducing local coordinates x, the tangent space txmn and

the cotangent space t 

x mn at the point x of mn are spanned by the basis vec-
tors   /x and dx,  = 1,    , n, respectively. these spaces constitute

the bers of the (co-)tangent bundle over mn. replacing t mn by its p-fold

tensor power we obtain the bundle of (covariant) tensors of rank p. restrict-

ing ourselves to completely antisymmetric tensors we are led to the exterior

1p(x)dx1      dxp

(1.6)

where f (p)

1p are completely antisymmetric coecients. the corresponding

algebra multiplication is the wedge product .

since we have a metric g = g(x)dx  dx at our disposal which gives

rise to an analogous bilinear form g = g(x)   for the cotangent bundle

we can promote the bers v(t 

atiyah-kahler algebra ak(t 

x mn, g) [1, 10, 11].

x mn) of the exterior algebra bundle to an

quite generally, the atiyah-kahler algebra ak(v, q) corresponding to an

arbitrary vector space v equipped with a quadratic form q consists of the

elements of the exterior algebra over v , v(v ) = lpvp(v ), for which the

following three products are dened:

 the exterior product 

 the inner product (, ) induced by q

 the cliord product 

the three products are required to be distributive with respect to the addition

and to satisfy the relation

a  b = a  b + (a, b)

(1.7)

the basic rule (1.7) is sucient in order to work out the -product of two

for all a, b v1(v ). the cliord product is associative by denition. hence
arbitrary elements in v(v ). below we shall give a closed formula for this

product.

10

the atiyah-kahler algebra combines the notions of an exterior algebra,

a grassmann algebra and a cliord algebra in an consistent manner. if we

omit the cliord product it reduces to the grassmann algebrav(v, q), while
omitting both  and (, ) yields the exterior algebra v(v ). without the
in the case at hand, v =v(t 

x mn) and q = g. this means that for two
basis 1-forms the inner product is given by (dx, dx) = g(dx, dx) = g and

structure of the -product it becomes a cliord algebra because (1.7) entails

a  b + b  a = 2(a, b) [11].

similarly for higher forms; for instance, (dxdx, dxdx) = gg gg.

a bundle over mn with typical ber ak(t 

x mn, g) is called an atiyah-

kahler bundle and sections through such bundles are referred to as dirac-

kahler elds. locally they are described by a collection of antisymmetric
tensor elds {f (p)

1p, p = 0,    n}. the three products dened in the ber give

rise to analogous products on the space of sections, for instance (1  2)(x) 

1(x)  2(x). of course, also all the other operations of the conventional

exterior calculus can be applied to dirac-kahler elds: the exterior derivative

d, the coderivative d, or the contraction with a vector eld v, i(v), to mention

just a few.

in our case the relations dening the cliord product assume the following

form when expressed in terms of the generating elements:

1  1 = 1,

1  dx = dx  1 = dx

dx  dx = dx  dx + g

(1.8)

by virtue of the postulated associativity of the -product, these relations are

sucient in order to determine the cliord product of two arbitrary dierential

forms. one nds [1, 3]

1  2 =

(1)p(p1)/2

p!

nxp=0

(ap e1    ep1)  (e1    ep2)

(1.9)

with e  i(),

e  gi() where i() denotes the contraction with

11

the basis vector . it is an anti-derivation with the properties

i()1 = 0,

i()dx = 


i()(1  2) = (i()1)  2 + (a1)  i()2

in writing down eqs. (1.9) and (1.10) we used the main automorphism a, a

linear map whose action on the dk-eld (1.6) is dened as

a =

nxp=0

(1)p (p)

(1.10)

later on we shall also need the main antiautomorphism b which acts ac-

cording to

b =

(1)p(p1)/2 (p)

nxp=0

(1.11)

obviously, a2 = b2 = 1, ab = ba, and also

a(1  2) = (a1)  (a2)

b(1  2) = (b2)  (b1)

(1.12)

for any pair of dk-elds.

as an important special case of (1.9) we note for later use that

dx   = dx   + e

(1.13)

let us look at the physical interpretation of the dk-elds now. from now

on we shall specialize the discussion to a at space-time mn = rn with the

metric g = . the generalization of a curved manifold and/or a manifold

with lorentzian signature would be straightforward, but we shall avoid these

technical complications here since they are not important for the point we

would like to make.

the interpretation of a dk-eld as a multiplet of dirac spinors is based

upon the following two logically independent observations.

12

(i) from (1.8) we obtain for the antisymmetrized cliord product of two

basis dierentials

dx  dx + dx  dx = 2

(1.14)

this relation should be compared to the one satised by the euclidean

dirac matrices :

 +  = 2

(1.15)

we conclude that the cliord left multiplication with dx denes a repre-

sentation of the algebra of -matrices in the space of (complex) inhomo-

geneous dierential forms: b= dx. this representation is reducible

though. assuming n even from now on, a dirac spinor has 2n/2 complex

components, and an irreducible representation of the algebra (1.15) is in

terms of 2n/2  2n/2 matrices. on the other hand, the dimension of the

exterior algebra is 2n, i.e. a dk-eld  has 2n independent complex com-

ponent elds. we shall see in a moment that the space k of all dk-elds

 can be decomposed into 2n/2 subspaces k() which are invariant under

cliord left multiplication, k = k

=1k(), k  2n/2. on k(), dx gives

rise to an irreducible representation of the algebra (1.15).

(ii) from the exterior derivative d and its adjoint, the coderivative d, we can

form the socalled dirac-kahler operator d  d which has the property

that it squares to the laplacian:

(d  d)2 = (dd + dd) = 

(1.16)

it shares this property with the dirac operator  and hence some

relationship among the two might be expected.

in fact, it turns out

that the dirac-kahler operator can be expressed in terms of a cliord

multiplication from the left:

(d  d)(x) = dx  (x)

(1.17)

13

since we know already that dx corresponds to a -matrix and leaves

the spaces k() invariant, we see that the dirac-kahler equation

(d  d + m) = 0

(1.18)

decomposes to a set of equations (dd+m)() = 0, ()  k(), each

of which is equivalent to an ordinary dirac equation ( + m) = 0.

following becher and joos [3] we can construct the invariant subspaces k()

as follows. we introduce a new basis {z} in k whose elements are labeled

by a pair of indices ,  = 1,    , 2n/2 and which are required to satisfy2

dx  z =

2n/2x=1

(t ) z

(1.19)

where the euclidean dirac matrices  are in the irreducible 2n/2-dimensional

representation. they satisfy (1.15) and are assumed to be hermitian,  = 
.

frequently we shall regard z  (z) as a matrix or, more precisely, as an

inhomogeneous dierential form which assumes values in the space of spinor

matrices. then (1.19) reads

dx  z = t z

(1.20)

this equation is satised by

z =

1
p!

nxp=0

t
1    t

p dx1      dxp

(1.21)

every dk-eld  can be expanded in the basis {z}:

(x) =x,

()

 (x) z

(1.22)

2we use the notation , ,    = 1,    , n for lorentz indices and , , ,    = 1,    , 2n/2

for spinor indices.

14

hence it follows immediately from (1.19) that the invariant subspaces k() are

spanned by

in fact, one has

()
 z  k(),

() x
dx  () =x  x

 xed.

(1.23)

()


 ! z

(1.24)

which shows that on k() cliord left-multiplication with dx is equivalent to
acting with the dirac matrix  on the spinor ()  {()

 ;  = 1,    , 2n/2}.

for every xed value of , () is an ordinary 2n/2-component dirac eld. by

virtue of the orthogonal decomposition  =p (), a dk-eld describes a

multiplet of 2n/2 dirac elds.

it is convenient to combine the expansion coecients ()


into a spinor

matrix b,

so that (1.22) reads

,



(b)  ()
(x) = trhb(x)z ti

b[dx  ] =  b[]

(1.25)

(1.26)

(1.27)

writing b[] for the matrix related to a given dk-eld , eq.(1.24) amounts

to

replacing dx   everywhere:

occasionally one nds a slightly dierent approach in the literature [2].

one assumes that the inhomogeneous form (1.6) is given and one uses its
coecient functions f (p)

1p in order to construct a spinor matrix bf by simply
bf  bf [] 

f (p)
1p 1    p

nxp=0

(1.28)

1
p!

15

then one veries that the map  7 bf [] satises
bf [dx  ] = bf [],

a property it has in common with b. hence we might expect that these two

matrix-valued elds are related. indeed, it turns out that they coincide up to

a constant factor. to see this, one inserts the expansions (1.6) and (1.21) into
(1.26) and obtains the following formula for the coecients of , f (p)

1p, as a

function of b:

f (p)

1p(x) = (1)p(p1)/2 trhb(x)[1    p]i

because of the orthogonality and completeness relations enjoyed by the dirac

f (p)

matrices, eq.(1.30) has a unique solution for b as a function of the coecients
1p which dene . one nds that b and bf are essentially the same thing:

f (p)
1p(x) 1    p

(1.29)

(1.30)

(1.31)

(1.32)

1
p!

b(x) = 2n/2

nxp=0
= 2n/2 bf (x)

this formula together with (1.25) gives us a practical tool to compute the

projection of  on the invariant subspaces k().

in standard discussions of dirac-kahler theory, because of the simple pro-

portionality of b and bf , there is no need for a conceptual distinction between

the two matrices. in order to establish their equivalence only familiar identities

involving -matrices such as

tr(cid:2)[1    p]([1    q])(cid:3) = 2n/2p! pq 1

[1    p

q]

(1.33)

are needed. in the symplectic case, the situation will be more complicated and

we have to distinguish more carefully b which arises from the construction
of left-invariant subspaces and bf which obtains by replacing dx   in

. a priori it is not clear that the two objects can easily be related to each

16

other since the metaplectic -matrices are innite dimensional. hence the

question whether there are trace identities analogous to (1.33) is a nontrivial

issue.

2 dirac-kahler elds and fermionic weyl

symbols

in this section we describe the relation between the conventional dirac-kahler

fermions and the weyl symbol calculus. in subsection 2.1 we summarize vari-

ous properties of the fermionic weyl symbol calculus and discuss a number of

special aspects and applications which will be relevant. in section 2.2 we show

that the fermionic weyl algebra w f is an atiyah-kahler algebra, and in sec-

tion 2.3 we introduce w f-valued elds over space-time. in 2.4 we demonstrate

that they can be identied with dirac-kahler elds. they carry a reducible

representation of the cliord algebra. the decomposition of w f into invariant

subspaces which carry an irreducible representation is performed in subsection

2.5.

2.1 the fermionic weyl algebra

we consider a set of operators b,  = 1,    , n, which satisfy the canonical

anticommutation relations

bb +bb =  

(2.1)

a relativistic particle, for instance [17, 26]. the most general operator we can

we could think of the bs as world line fermions which represent the spin of
construct by forming linear combinations of products of bs has the structure

with arbitrary (complex-valued) constants f (p)

1p.

we would like to establish a linear one-to-one correspondence between the

operators (2.2) and functions f depending on grassmann numbers 1, 2,    , n

with  +  = 0. the function f () which characterizes the operator bf
is called the symbol of bf: f = symb(bf ). there are many symbol maps

which relate operators to classical functions. here we are interested in the

weyl symbol which is dened as follows. given the operator (2.2) we dene

f () = [symb(bf )]() =

1
p!

nxp=0

f (p)
1p 12    p

(2.3)

which, for a given ordering, is a well dened map from operators to functions.

in fact, f () can be regarded as a classical phase function of a mechanical

a given f () amounts to picking a particular operator ordering prescription.

the inverse mapping is not well dened yet, because in (2.3) we can add to
f (p)
1p arbitrary tensors which are symmetric in at least one index pair. this

in particular, symb(b) =  and symb(i) = 1 where i is the unit operator.
does not change f (), but it does change bf. specifying a unique operator bf for
system with grassmann-odd phase-space coordinates , and the bs are the
rule which means that bf follows from f () by substituting  b in (2.3) and
form. for instance, the product  yields the operator [bb]weyl = 1
2(bb 
bb) b[b]. for an arbitrary monomial,

corresponding quantum operators. we shall employ the weyl correspondence

writing all operator products in weyl ordered, i.e. completely antisymmetrized

symb1(1    p) =b[1   bp]

(2.4)

where the square brackets indicate complete antisymmetrization.

in the following we shall require the constants f (p)

1p appearing in the series

expansion of the symbol f () to be completely antisymmetric tensors. then

the operator bf associated to the series (2.3) is obtained by simply replacing
 b in this series, and this leads us back to the operator (2.2).

18

if n is odd, the inverse symbol map is still not uniquely dened, because in

this case the operator b1b2   bn commutes with all operators and is propor-
tional to the identity therefore. by multiplying any operator by b1b2   bn

if necessary one can represent all operators by even symbols. this prescrip-

tion makes the correspondence between operators and symbols bijective. (see

[26, 27] for further details.)

if a string of operators is not contracted with an antisymmetric tensor we

must reorder it before we can use

symb(b[1   bp]) = 1    p

in order to read o its symbol. for instance,

(2.5)

(2.6)

(2.8)

symb(bb) = symb(cid:20)b[b] +



(cid:21) =  +

the symbols f () are functions of the same type as those considered in

appendix a, to which the reader might turn at this point. among other

things, various linear operations on such functions are discussed there which

are particularly useful in the context of the symbol calculus. this includes

the main automorphism a, the main antiautomorphism b, the hodge

operator  and the modied hodge operator .
while we allow for complex coecients f (p)

1p, we assume that the oper-

ators b are hermitian, b = (b), and that  is real,  = . hence it

follows that

where the overbar means complex conjugation.

symb(bf ) = symb(bf )

(2.7)

there is a simple integral formula for the operator bf associated to a given

weyl symbol f ():

bf =z b()ef() dn

19

here ef() is the fourier transform of f () as dened in eq.(a.22) of the ap-

pendix, and

b()  exp (ib)

(2.9)

is the fermionic analogue of the weyl operators which implement translations

on phase-space. using the identities of appendix a one can verify that eqs.

(2.4) and (2.8) are indeed equivalent.

an important concept is the star product3 or twisted product which

mimics the multiplication of operators at the level of symbols. it satises

(2.10)

symb(bfbg) = symb(bf )  symb(bg)

for all operators bf and bg. as a consequence, the -product is associative,

distributive with respect to +, but not commutative. it is a deformation of

the pointwise product of functions to which it reduces in the limit   0.

from

and eq.(2.6) it follows that

symb(i) = 1, symb(b) = 

1  1 = 1,

1   =   1 = 

   =  +



2



(2.11)

(2.12)

by virtue of its postulated distributivity and associativity, the relations (2.12)

characterize the -product uniquely. they are sucient to work out the prod-

uct f  g of arbitrary functions f and g.

3both in the fermionic and the bosonic case we keep using the traditional name star

product even though we write  instead of the usual symbol . following refs. [29, 30, 21]

this notation indicates that we are dealing with a berwise twisted product which should

not be confused with the   m-product which would refer to the base of the weyl algebra

bundles we are going to construct in section 2.2. it is the m- product rather than the

-product which is needed for the deformation quantization [24] of physical systems on the

phase-space m. in the present paper, the m-product plays no role, however. (note also

that  stands for the hodge operator in our case.)

20

eq.(2.7) implies that complex conjugation changes the order of the factors

in a star product:

f1  f2 = f2  f1

(2.13)

the space of functions f () equipped with the -product will be referred

to as the fermionic weyl algebra w f.

in the literature [26, 27] one nds the following integral representation for

the -product of two arbitrary functions:

(f1  f2)() =

2i(cid:19)nz exp(cid:20)

where4 1

various alternative representations of the star product are needed. they are

derived in appendix b. the rst one reads

the result (2.17) looks surprisingly simple and is completely analogous to its

bosonic counterpart. all the complicated sign factors which appeared during

the calculation, either explicitly or hidden in the a-automorphism, conspired

to disappear from the nal result.

depending on the problem at hand one or another of the above representa-

tions is the most convenient one. eq.(2.15) we shall relate to kahlers formula

for the cliord product shortly. from eq.(2.16) one immediately reads o the

important special cases

  f () = f () +

(2.18)

(2.19)

in order to calculate the product of two -functions, which we shall need later

on, eq.(2.14) is most suitable:

2(cid:19)n
(  )() = (1)n(n1)/2(cid:18) 

(2.20)

up to now we regarded the bs as abstract operators. let us look at

concrete representations on some nite dimensional vector space v f. if  is

a set of hermitian matrices which satisfy the cliord algebra relations

satises the canonical anticommutation relations (2.1). here  denotes the

dirac matrices in an arbitrary, possibly reducible representation. the notation

 is reserved for the (essentially unique) irreducible representation on v f =

ck, k  2n/2, if n is even. the operators bf : w f  w f of eq.(2.2) are k  k

matrices then. the space of these operators will be denoted by l(w f).

22

the identication (2.22) must be interpreted with some care. in setting up

the symbol calculus one adopts the rule that the operators b anticommute

with numbers of odd grassmann parity. on the other hand, the entries of the

matrices  are ordinary complex numbers, so  commutes with all elements

of the grassmann algebra.

these operators are reminiscent of the (bosonic) weyl operators. however, as

they stand, they are not unitary but rather hermitian, () = (). this is

next we list a few properties of the operatorsb which we shall need shortly.
due to the fact thatb anticommutes with the grassmann-odd s . actually
it is the operators b(i/) = exp(b/) which play the role of the weyl
operators on a fermionic phase-space. they are unitary,b(i/) =b(i/)1,
and they shift b by  times the unit operator:
b(i/)bb(i/) =b +

b(1)b(2) = exp(
 b() = b()(cid:20)ib +
(cid:21)
(cid:21) b()
= (cid:20)ib 

the derivative of b() can be written in either of the two forms

this leads to a projective representation of the translation group since

when we replace in b the operators b by the dirac matrices via (2.22)

(2.29)

(2.30)

(2.31)

we shall need these relations when we decompose the reducible dirac-kahler

representation.

an interesting example where one can see the symbol calculus at work is

the generalization of the chirality matrix 5 in 4 dimensions. we assume that

n is even in the remainder of this subsection and employ the dirac matrices 

in the 2n/2-dimensional representation. from (1.15) and () =  it follows

that the matrix

n+1  in(n1)/2 12    n

satises n+1 = n+1,

2
n+1 = 1

and


n+1 = n+1

in all even dimensions. the sign of (2.32) is chosen such that for n = 4

we identify

(2.32)

(2.33)

(2.34)

(2.35)

(2.36)

and interpret n+1 as the matrix representation of the abstract operator

(2.37)

(2.38)

bgn+1 = in(n1)/2 nb1b2   bn

its symbol symb(bgn+1)  gn+1 follows directly from (2.5) if we note that
b1   bn = 1nb[1   bn]/(n!):

gn+1() = in(n1)/2 n 12    n

= (i)n(n1)/2 n nn1    1

hence, up to a constant, n+1 is represented by the -function:

gn+1() = (i)n(n1)/2 n ()

(2.39)

as a consequence of eqs. (2.20) and (a.21), this function satises

gn+1  gn+1 = 1

and gn+1 = gn+1

(2.40)

which reects the properties (2.33) of n+1. by virtue of (a.26) the fourier

transform of gn+1 is the constant function

egn+1() = (i)n(n1)/2 n

(2.41)

in appendix a we dened the modied hodge operator  for a general

grassmann algebra and we showed that it is related to the fourier transfor-

mation via eq.(a.41). using the latter equation together with the integral

representation (2.14) for the star product it its not dicult to see that the ap-

plication of  to some f  w f is essentially equivalent to a star-multiplication

with gn+1 from the right. for a homogeneous function of degree p,

f (p)() = (i)n(n1)/22pn (f (p)  gn+1)()

(2.42)

if we rescale  we can write down a similar equation for inhomogeneous func-

tions even:

f (/) = (i)n(n1)/2 (f  gn+1)(/)

(2.43)

25

finally we remark that the chirality operator bgn+1 can be expressed as an

integral over the weyl operators:

bgn+1 = (i)n(n1)/2nz dnb()

(2.44)

this is a remarkable relation because contrary to the original denition of

n+1 as the product of all dirac matrices it carries over to the symplectic case

almost literally.

2.2 w f as an atiyah-kahler algebra

let us come back to the abstract atiyah-kahler algebra ak(v, q) discussed in

the introduction. it is important to observe that the weyl algebra w f which

we reviewed in the previous section contains all the ingredients which make up

an atiyah-kahler algebra:

(i) the vector space v is spanned by the basis elements 1,    , n and the

exterior algebra over this space,v(v ) = n
p=0vp(v ), consists of mono-
mials 1    p  vp(v ). the exterior product  on v(v ) is the
pointwise product of (inhomogeneous) functions f () v(v ).
tacitly decided for an inner product (|) onv(v ). the quadratic form
q is induced by g  , regarded as an inner product of v . onv1(v )

(ii) by starting from the canonical anticommutation relations (2.1) we have

we have

(|) = 2 

(2.45)

and similarly for p > 1 (see below).

(iii) the star product on w f provides a concrete realization of the abstract

cliord product. the cliord product is associative and distributive

over +, and so is the star product. moreover, ,  and (, ) have to

26

satisfy the consistency condition (1.7). from eq.(2.12) it follows that

this relation is indeed satised by the star multiplication together with

the pointwise multiplication and the inner product (|):

   =  + (|)

(2.46)

in particular, upon symmetrization,    +    = 2(|).

thus we may conclude that the fermionic weyl algebra w f is a concrete

realization of an atiyah-kahler algebra.

let us be more explicit about the inner product on v(v ). within the

symbol calculus, the standard inner product of dk-theory [11] admits a very

natural representation in terms of the star product:

(f1|f2) = [ f1  f2]( = 0)

(2.47)

here f1 and f2 are two arbitrary inhomogeneous functions. we allow their
expansion coecients f (p)

1p to become complex. note, however, that the

complex conjugation in (2.47) is necessary even if the coecients are taken to

be real, see eq.(a.10). using the integral representation

(f1|f2) = (i 2)nnz f1(1) exp(2

and expanding f1 and f2 according to

1 2) f2(2) dn1dn2

f () =

1
p!

p f (p)

1p 1    p

(2.48)

(2.49)

nxp=0

nxp=0

with appropriate powers of  separated o from the expansion coecients, it

is easy to derive that

(f1|f2) =

1
p!

1 1p f (p) 1p
f (p)

2

(2.50)

the inner products among the basis elements ofvp(v ) (homogeneous func-

tions of degree p) can be written down similarly. for p = 1 one recovers (2.45),

and for p = 2 one has, for instance

(|) = 4(  )

(2.51)

27

we note that (|) has the important property of making the star multipli-

cation with  a self-adjoint operator. if we dene

c  : w f  w f,

(c f )() =   f ()

(2.52)

then eq.(2.18) tells us that c  is given by the rst order dierential operator

c  =  +

1





(2.53)

if one writes the inner product as in (2.47), the self-adjointness of c  is obvious:

(c f1|f2) = [(  f1)  f2](0)

= [(f1  )  f2](0)

= [f1  (  f2)](0)

= (f1|c f2)

(2.54)

here we exploited (2.13) and the associativity of the star product.

2.3 symbol-valued elds on space-time

the most familiar application of the above symbol calculus is the deformation

theory approach [24, 26] to the quantization of fermionic systems. in this con-

text, the variables  are coordinates on the phase-space of the physical system

under consideration. if there are additional bosonic degrees of freedom (such

as the position of a spinning particle, say) this fermionic phase-space is em-

bedded in a larger graded phase-space, a supermanifold with both commuting

and anticommuting coordinates [17].

in the present paper we are investigating a dierent setting. rather than

phase-space, the physical arena here is space-time, an ordinary riemannian

manifold (mn, g), not a supermanifold. the fermionic weyl algebra w f enters

the construction as the ber of certain bundles over space-time which we shall

refer to as weyl algebra bundles [30].

28

by denition, the base of a weyl algebra bundle is (mn, g) and the typical

ber is w f, i.e., at each space-time point x we attach a local copy w f

x of

w f. the quadratic form q on w f

x is provided by the metric g evaluated

at the point x. local coordinates on the total space are pairs (x, f ) where

x  (x) are coordinates referring to some chart of mn, and f is a function

of the grassmann variables 1,    , n. the transition functions are dened in

close analogy with the exterior algebra bundle. a coordinate transformation

x  ex(x) on mn is accompanied by f  ef with ef such that ef (e) = f ()
where e  (ex/x), i.e. ,  transforms in the same manner as dx.

sections through a weyl algebra bundle are locally represented by functions

where

x 7 f (x, )  w f
x

f (x, ) :  7 f (x, )

(2.55)

(2.56)

is a function of n commuting and n anticommuting variables. we dene a

berwise star product of two such sections by

(f1  f2)(x, ) =(cid:16)f1(x, )  f2(x, )(cid:17)()

(2.57)

for each point x.

we can apply the inverse symbol map to f (x, ) and thus obtain a family

of operators labelled by the space-time points x:

if we x a concrete matrix representation of the fermionic operators on some

bf (x)  symb1f (x, )

(2.58)

x of v f, i.e., bf (x) 

representation space v f, then bf (x) acts on a local copy v f

x ). we are particularly interested in the case where v f carries the irre-
ducible 2n/2-dimensional representation of the cliord algebra (for n even).

l(v f

then v f

x is a ber of the usual spin bundle over mn whose sections are the

familiar dirac spinor elds.

29

in the present paper we shall not be concerned with the global properties

of weyl algebra bundles. our main interest is in the metaplectic analog of

the dirac-kahler construction, and for this purpose it is sucient to compare

to the topologically trivial bundles over the at space-time mn = rn. an

analogous discussion could be given for arbitrary curved space-times as well,

but we shall avoid the necessary technical complications here. thus, in our

case, sections can be represented globally by functions f (x, ). we remark

that there exists a natural inner product on the space of these functions:

hf1|f2i =z dnx (f1(x, )|f2(x, ))

(2.59)

2.4 dirac-kahler elds and symbol calculus

let us assume we are given an arbitrary dk eld  on at euclidean space-time

rn. it possesses an expansion

(x) =

1
p!

nxp=0

1p(x) dx1      dxp
f (p)

(2.60)

the (complex) coecient functions are taken to be completely antisymmetric

in all p indices so that there is a bijective correspondence between forms 
and sets {f (p)

1p} of antisymmetric tensors. given these tensors, we form the

following matrix-valued eld:

1
p!

nxp=0

1p(x) 12    p
f (p)

(2.61)

bf (x) =

from now on we assume that n is even and that the dirac matrices are in

x of the
representation space v f = ck, k = 2n/2. by virtue of (2.35) we may regard

their irreducible representation. hence bf (x) acts on a local copy v f
bf (x) as a matrix realization of the abstract operator
1p(x)b1b2   bp

bf (x) =

(2.62)

p
p!

nxp=0

f (p)

30

for every point x, the symbol of this operator is f (x, ) = [symb bf (x)](), or

1p(x) 12    p
f (p)

f (x, ) =

(2.63)

p
p!

nxp=0

thus we have set up a linear one-to-one correspondence between dierential

forms (x) and symbol functions f (x, ). schematically,

(x) ^(t 

x mn)  bf (x)  l(v f

x )  f (x, )  w f
x

(2.64)

the rst one of the two bijections in (2.64) is the usual dirac-kahler corre-

spondence dx   which we mentioned already in the introduction, while

the second one is the weyl symbol map. taken in conjunction, these maps

relate dk-elds to symbols. in particular,

dx  

(2.65)

we shall use the notation  : f 7 [f ] for the linear map which yields the

dierential form belonging to a given symbol. for instance,

[] = dx

(2.66)

what makes the above construction particularly useful is that under the

map  many of the familiar linear and bilinear operations involving dieren-

tial forms naturally pass over to the symbol functions and vice versa. this

is immediately obvious for the automorphism a, the antiautomorphism b,

the hodge operator  and the modied hodge operator . comparing their

denition for symbols in appendix a to their standard denition in terms of

dierential forms one sees that

a[f ] = [af ] ,

b[f ] = [bf ]

[f ] = [f ] ,

[f ] = [f ]

(2.67)

the exterior derivative d = dx translates into ,

d[f ] = [f ]

(2.68)

31

while the contraction i(v) with a vector eld v = v becomes a derivative

with respect to :

in particular,

i(v)[f ] = [1v 

 f ]

e[f ] = [1 

 f ]

the natural inner product on the space of dk-elds is5

h1, 2i =z 1  2

its counterpart at the symbol level is (2.59) with (2.47):

(2.69)

(2.70)

(2.71)

h[f1], [f2]i = hf1|f2i

(2.72)

the coderivative d is the formal adjoint of d with respect to h, i. on at

space one has

whence

d = e

d[f ] = [1




f ]

(2.73)

(2.74)

the wedge product of dierential forms is mapped onto the pointwise prod-

uct of symbol functions:

[f1]  [f2] = [f1f2]

(2.75)

the most important aspect of the form/symbol correspondence is that the

image of the cliord product is precisely the berwise star product (2.57):

[f1]  [f2] = [f1  f2]

(2.76)

5all terms which are not of degree n are supposed to be discarded from the integrand in

(2.71).

32

this can be seen for instance by mapping kahlers formula (1.9) for the cliord

product on our representation (2.15) of the fermionic weyl star product:

[f1]  [f2] =

(1)p(p1)/2

(2.77)

here we used (2.67), (2.70) and (2.75).

one also could prove eq.(2.76) inductively. if we replace dx by  and

 by the star product in the relations (1.8) which dene the cliord product

we obtain exactly eqs.(2.12) for the star product. therefore eq.(2.76) is correct

for zero-and one-forms. its generalization for arbitrary p-forms makes essential

use of the associativity of both the cliord and the star product.

by virtue of our rules for the form/symbol correspondence also the equa-

tions (1.13) and (2.18) are now seen to be completely equivalent.

in the dk-equation we need the cliord product of dx with an arbitrary

form :

dx  [f ] = []  [f ]

= [  f ]

= [c f ]

(2.78)

here c  is the rst order dierential operator (2.53). in the introduction we

discussed already that dx, regarded as an operator on the space of dk-elds,

gives rise to the cliord algebra (1.14). for consistency the same should be

true for the star multiplication with  and for c  on the space of symbols.

33

in fact, it is easy to see that

()() + ()() = 2

and

c c  + c c  = 2

the dk-operator acting on forms reads

(d  d) = dx   + e

= dx  

(2.79)

(2.80)

(2.81)

where the second equality follows from (1.13). therefore dd becomes 

or c  at the symbol level:

(d  d)[f ] = [  f ]

= [c f ]

this converts the dk-equation to

(cid:20)(cid:18) 1






+ (cid:19)  + m(cid:21) f (x, ) = 0

in closing we return to the chirality operator n+1. under the map , the

image of the delta-function is essentially the volume form vol  dx1  dx2 

    dxn:

[n()] = (1)n(n1)/2 vol

for the chirality operator this means that

[gn+1  f ] = in(n1)/2 vol  [f ]

which, at the operator level, corresponds to

(2.82)

(2.83)

(2.84)

(2.85)

(2.86)

\gn+1  f = n+1bf

thus we see that (up to unimportant constants) the fermionic -function, the

volume form, and the chirality matrix n+1 are simply dierent variants of the

same object. furthermore, by eq.(2.43), star multiplication of f by gn+1 from

the right amounts to applying the modied hodge operator .

invariant subspaces of w f

the dierential operators c  or the star left-multiplication by  dene a rep-

resentation of the cliord algebra (2.21) in the space of symbols f (). as f ()

has 2n independent (complex) components, this representation is reducible. it

can be decomposed into 2n/2 representations each of which is isomorphic to

the 2n/2-dimensional irreducible representation provided by the matrices .

(we assume n even in this section.) as a consequence, a symbol-valued eld

f (x, ) describes 2n/2 ordinary dirac spinor elds.

in the light of the form/symbol correspondence which we developed in the

previous section it is clear that the representation carried by w f could be de-

composed simply by invoking the standard discussion at the level of dierential

forms. however, as our main motivation for studying the symbol formulation

of dk-elds is to get some understanding of their symplectic analogs we shall

reformulate the method of becher and joos [3] in symbol language and use

this as a guide in the symplectic case. as a by-product we shall nd a very el-

egant derivation of their matrix-valued form z which puts it in a more general

perspective.

we have to decompose the weyl algebra in orthogonal subspaces,

w f =

km=1

w f
()

,

k  2n/2

(2.87)

such that w f

() is invariant under star left-multiplication by . following a
strategy similar to the one described in the introduction we look for a k  k-

matrix valued function z() with the property

  z() =

kx=1

(t ) z()

(2.88)

the function z is readily found in our formalism. since the star product with

 involves rst derivatives at most, eq.(2.88) is reminiscent of the formulas

for the derivative of the weyl operatorsb and  which we displayed in section

35

2.1. in fact, using those formulas together with (2.18) it is easy to show that

there exists a rescaling of the arguments of b and  in such a way that the
star multiplication by  corresponds to an operator multiplication by b or

:

 b(i2) = b(i2)b
 b(2) =  ibb(2)

  (i2) =   (i2)

(2.89)

(2.90)

(2.91)

for the problem at hand, eq.(2.91) is precisely what we need. if  constitutes

(2.92)

(2.93)

clearly (2.93) is precisely the symbol corresponding to the form (1.21) which

was found by becher and joos [3] using dierent techniques. in the context of

the present investigation it is important to keep in mind that z is nothing but

a rescaled fermionic weyl operator since the latter has a well-known bosonic

analog.

because of the completeness properties of the -matrices, {z;

,  = 1,    , k} is a basis for w f and we may expand any symbol as

f (x, ) =

=

kx=1
kx=1

()

 (x) z()

kx=1

f ()(x, )

(2.94)

(here we use already the notation appropriate for the role of w f as a ber

at the point x.) the rest of the argument parallels our discussion in the

36

introduction. we obtain k  2n/2 invariant subspaces w f

() (left ideals) which

are spanned by

f ()(x, ) =

kx=1

()
 (x)z()  w f

x()

(2.95)

for every xed value of , the expansion coecients ()  {()

 ;  = 1,    , k}

can be interpreted as an ordinary dirac spinor. eq.(2.88) shows that acting

with  on f () is equivalent to applying  on ():

  f () = x  x

(2.96)

let us arrange the expansion coecients ()

()

 . then,

 as a k  k-matrix: (b) 

(2.97)

f (x, ) = trhb(x)z()ti

denoting the b-matrix which belongs to a given section f by b[f ] we obtain

from (2.96)

which mirrors (1.27) at the symbol level.

b[  f ] =  b[f ]

(2.98)

given a symbol-valued eld f (x, ) we can immediately construct the as-

in its series expansion (2.63).

sociated spinor matrix-valued eld bf (x) of (2.61) by replacing   1
representation carried by f we discovered a second spinor-matrix, b, which is

related to f in a canonical way, too. by essentially the same argument as in

in the process of decomposing the reducible

the introduction it follows that the two matrices are equal up to a constant:

if we insert the expansions (2.63) and (2.93) for f (x, ) and z(), respectively,
into eq.(2.97), we obtain eq.(1.30) for the set {f (p)

1p} expressed in terms of

(2.99)

b[f ](x) = 2n/2 bf (x)

37

and using the trace identity (1.33), one nds that the expansion coecients of

b. making an ansatz for b in terms of antisymmetrized products of -matrices
b and bf dier by an overall constant only.

while this last step was straightforward for the so(n)-spinors, it will be

much less trivial for metaplectic spinors where the representation space is

innite-dimensional and trace-identities such as (1.33) are not likely to exist.

it will be interesting to see how (2.99) is modied then.

3 symplectic dirac-kahler elds

in the previous section we reformulated the theory of standard dk-fermions

over space-time in terms of elds f which assume values in the fermionic weyl

algebra w f. now we are going to ask what happens if we replace w f by its

(actually much more familiar) bosonic counterpart, the bosonic weyl algebra

w. rather than space-time it is now a phase-space (m2n , ) which plays

the role of the base manifold. as we shall argue, replacing the riemannian

structure by a symplectic one, the structure group so(n) by sp(2n), and,

most importantly, fermionic weyl symbols by bosonic ones, we are led to the

notion of a symplectic dk-eld in a very natural way.

in subsection 3.1 we begin by working out some special properties of

bosonic weyl symbols which will become important in our construction. in

this context, we are basically discussing the conventional quantum mechanics

auxiliary phase-space will be identied with the tangent space to the true

results from quantizing the at auxiliary phase-space r2n . (later on the

of the auxiliary quantum system with canonical operators bxi and bi which
(physical) phase-space m2n .) the operators bxi and bi take over the role
previously played by b.

we propose a symplectic analog of the chirality matrix 5 there. the actual

subsection 3.2 is devoted to the metaplectic -matrices.

in particular,

38

construction of the symplectic dk-elds is performed in section 3.3, and in

section 3.4 it is shown how they relate to the metaplectic spinor elds.

3.1 bosonic weyl symbols

we consider a hamiltonian system with n degrees of freedom whose classical

phase-space is the symplectic plane (r2n , ). the associated quantum me-

chanical hilbert space is v and l(v) denotes the space of linear operators on

v. the hilbert space v carries a representation of the canonical commutation

relations

[ba,bb] = i  ab;

a, b = 1,    , 2n

(3.1)

in a canonical operator basis we split ba  (bi,bxi), i = 1,    , n, so that the
only nonvanishing commutator is between the momenta bi and the positions
bxi : [bi,bxj] = iij. the matrix (ab) is the inverse of the constant matrix

(ab) formed from the coecients of the symplectic 2-form : abbc = c

a. on

(r2n , ) we use canonical coordinates ya  (yi

p, yi

q) such that

(ab) =

0 +i

here {|i} is the basis which diagonalizes the position operators:

sometimes it will be more suggestive to use a tensor notation instead of

  (n )(  ) for the identity

elements of some arbitrarybb  l(v) or 
analog of a spinor index. in thebx-eigenbasis, the weyl operators are given by

from the completeness relation (3.7) it follows that every operatorbb can

with the complex-valued functioneb given by
eb(y) = trhbt (y)bbi
the function eb (referred to as the alternative weyl symbol [16]) is closely
related to the weyl symbol ofeb. in fact, b(y)  [symb(bb)](y) is the fourier
transform ofeb:

i.e., the symplectic fourier transformation is an exact involution,eeb(y) = b(y)

(and not only an involution up to a reection of the argument).

eqs.

(3.10)-(3.12) dene the (bosonic) weyl symbol map symb from

l(v) to the space of (generalized) functions over the symplectic plane, as well

as its inverse. the classical phase-function b(y) uniquely represents an operator

bb which is weyl ordered. in particular, the monomial ya1ya2    yap stands for
the completely symmetrized operator product b(a1ba2   bap). conversely,

(3.14)

[symb{b(a1   bap)}](y) = ya1ya2    yap

the symmetrization in (3.14) is crucial, otherwise commutator terms would

occur. for instance,

[symb{babb}](y) = yayb + i

expansion

b(y) =

xp=0

(3.16)

(3.17)

by the symbol map, they are bijectively related to the operators

provided the tensors b(p)

a1ap are completely symmetric. if b is a power series,

the alternative weyl symboleb is a sum of derivatives of -functions:

as in every symbol calculus, the pertinent star product is required to satisfy

symb(bb1bb2) = b1  b2 where b1 and b2 are the symbols ofbb1 andbb2, respectively.

at least for power series, the bosonic weyl star product is uniquely determined

by its associativity, the distributivity over +, and the basic relations

on the space of symbols with an appropriate fall-o behavior we would

like to introduce a sesquilinear inner product (|) with respect to which c a is

selfadjoint,

(c ab1|b2) = (b1|c ab2)

it is clear from our earlier discussion that the choice

(b1|b2) = [b1  b2](y = 0)

(3.24)

(3.25)

meets this requirement. since b1  b2 = b2  b1 also here, the proof is the same

as in (2.54). if b1 and b2 are power series of the type (3.16), eq.(3.25) boils

down to

(3.26)

it is instructive to look at various alternative ways of representing this inner

product. there exists the integral representation

(b1|b2) = (2)2nz d2n y1 d2n y2 b1(y1/) ei(y1,y2) b2(y2/)

which can be reexpressed in terms of a symplectic fourier transform:

(3.27)

(3.28)

(3.29)

furthermore, if (3.18) can be applied,

(b1|b2) = (2)nz d2n y b1(

(b1|b2) = b2(cid:18)i2ac 

y)eb2(y)
yc(cid:19) b1(y)|y=0

the above formulae should be compared to their counterparts in the fermionic

symbol calculus. bosonic symbols admitting a power series expansion are
characterized by sets {b(p)

a1ap, p = 0, 1, 2,   } consisting of innitely many

symmetric tensors. fermionic symbol functions are equivalent to a nite set
{f (p)

1p, p = 0, 1,    , n} of antisymmetric tensors instead.

we saw that the (modied) hodge operator is essentially the same oper-

ation as the grassmannian fourier transformation. omitting all sign factors

(which anyhow have no bosonic analog) we have, schematically,

 f ()  f ()  ef ()  f (




)()

(3.30)

thus one is tempted to dene a bosonic version of the hodge operator simply

by setting (b)(y) =eb(y) so that  = 1 on any b. if b is a power series, eq.(3.18)

is indeed formally analogous to (a.24) for the fermionic fourier transformation.

however, the dierence is that the derivative of the fermionic delta-function,

f (/)(), again is a powers series in the s, while this is of course not

true for the derivatives of the bosonic delta-function, (2n )(y). in the former

case, the monomials 1    pare mapped onto monomials of the same type.
therefore one set of antisymmetric tensors {f (p)

a1ap} is mapped onto another

43

set of such tensors. in the latter case, the space of symmetric tensors b(p)

a1ap

is not mapped onto itself. the image of ya1ya2    yap is a singular symbol

mation as the bosonic (symmetric tensor) analog of the hodge operator. for

instance, by (2.48) with (a.22) and (a.40) the fermionic inner product has the

same general structure as (3.28):

(f1|f2)  z f1()ef2() dn
 z f1() (f2)() dn

(3.31)

in the language of dierential forms this is nothing but the familiar inner
product ( 1  2) in disguise. the product (b1|b2) introduced above is

analogous to it, but refers to symmetric rather than antisymmetric tensors.

the space of symbols b(y) equipped with the pointwise product of functions,

the star product, and the inner product constitutes the bosonic weyl algebra

w. it is the counterpart of the algebra w f which, endowed with analogous

structures, had turned out to be an atiyah-kahler algebra. because(cid:0)ya|yb(cid:1) =

iab/2 we see that the three product structures on w satisfy the consistency

condition

ya  yb = yayb +(cid:0)ya|yb(cid:1)

(3.32)

this relation is completely analogous to eq.(2.46) which had been identied

with the dening property of an atiyah-kahler algebra, eq.(1.7). this supports

our point of view that the bosonic weyl algebra is the natural analog of an

atiyah-kahler algebra if one works in a symplectic rather than a riemannian

setting.

3.2

-matrices for mp(2n ) and the analog of 5

the generators of mp(2n) in the spinor representation are obtained as sym-

metrized bilinears ab

meta = (ab + ba)/4 built from 2n -matrices satis-

fying

upon identifying

ab  ba = 2i ab

(3.33)

(3.34)

it is clear that the relations (3.33) coincide precisely with (3.1). hence, what in

a = ba

the language of group theory is called a symplectic cliord algebra is nothing

but the canonical commutation relations of a bosonic quantum system with the

canonical operators ba = (bj,bxj). for n nite, all irreducible representations

of the canonical commutation relations are unitarily equivalent, so the same is

true for the symplectic cliord algebra. all these representations are innite

dimensional.

we consider representations where a is a hermitian operator on the hilbert

space v. frequently v is taken to be the fock space of n independent har-

monic oscillators [17, 31]. then the as are linear combinations of the corre-

sponding creation and annihilation operators. here we shall employ another

representation which is particularly natural in the gauge theory approach to

quantum mechanics [21]. we pick thebx-eigenbasis (3.8) with respect to which
h|bxj|i = j(n )(  ) and h|bj|i = ij(n )(  ). therefore, in a

symbolic matrix notation with h|a|i  (a)
,

(j)

 = (2i/) j(n )(  )

(n +j)

 = j(n )(  )

;

j = 1,    , n

(3.35)

the hilbert space v is the space of square integrable functions ()  h|i 

 with its usual inner product. the generators ab

meta act on v as second order

45

dierential operators (schrodinger hamiltonians with a quadratic potential;

see refs. [22, 23] for further details).

any attempt at putting metaplectic spinors on a similar footing as the

so(n)-spinors faces the problem that v is innite dimensional and that a

metaplectic spinor formally is an object   () with innitely many com-

ponents. as an immediate consequence, trace identities such as (1.33) have

no direct counterpart for the metaplectic -matrices. in thebx-basis, for in-
stance, the trace of an operatorbb  l(v) reads tr(bb) =r dn h|bb|i, and it

is clear that monomials such as a1    ap do not possess a trace. remarkably

enough, it turns out that there exist identities similar to (1.33) even in the

innite dimensional case which, however, involve the sp(2n)-analog of n+1.

we are familiar with the fact that when we are dealing with spinors on an

even-dimensional space-time there exists a chirality matrix n+1, a generaliza-

tion of 5 in 4 dimension, which anticommutes with any . its eigenvalues are

1 and +1, and the corresponding eigenspaces are the left- and right-handed

weyl spinors, respectively.

it is quite interesting that we can introduce an

analogous concept for metaplectic spinors and that the pertinent chirality

operator has a very natural interpretation even. let us try to nd an opera-

tor p  l(v) which anticommutes with all as,

and satises

p a + ap = 0


p = 1

p = p

(3.36)

(3.37)

thus p has the same algebraic properties as 5, its eigenvalues are 1 and,

provided it actually exists, we can use it to form the chiral projections

 = ,

 

1
2

(1  p )

(3.38)

of any   v. since ab

meta commutes with p , the mp(2n)-transformations

46

leave the subspaces with p = +1 and p = 1 invariant, so that the repre-

sentation of mp(2n) implied by the -matrices (3.35) decomposes accordingly.

looking at the metaplectic 5-matrix from the point of view of the aux-

we may identify p with the standard parity operator p in this context. by

iliary quantum mechanics with the b-degrees of freedom it becomes clear that
denition, p changes the sign of both the positions bxi and the momenta
bi : pbxip = bxi, pbip = bi. hence p ap = a for a = (bi,bxi),
bx-representation

which is exactly (3.36) with p  p . the operator p acts on the wave func-

tions   v as (p )()  (p )() = (). this means that in the

p |i = |  i

(3.39)

so that the matrix elements of p are given by

(p )

  h|p |i = (n )( + )

(3.40)

thus, metaplectic chirality is nothing but berwise parity, and the pro-

jections v are simply the subspaces of even and odd wave functions, respec-

tively.

the operator p can be written in a manifestly basis independent way6:

p = (4)nz d2n ybt (y)

(3.41)

the general properties of the weyl operators imply that (3.41) has the desired

properties (3.36), (3.37) and using the matrix elements (3.9) one nds that

(3.41) coincides with (3.40). eq.(3.41) is strikingly similar to eq.(2.44) for bgn+1

which conrms our interpretation that the berwise parity transformation is

the analog of 5.

the operator p has a well dened nite trace:

6eq.(3.41) shows that p belongs to the family of parity-type operators discussed by

tr[p ] = 2n

(3.42)

grossmann [32] and royer [33].

47

this follows from (3.41) with (3.6) or simply by noting that

tr[p ] =z dn  (p )

 =z dn  (n )(2) = 2n

(3.43)

while the very existence of this trace is remarkable, we see the rst major

dierence between the bosonic and the fermionic case here. both 5 and p

have eigenvalues 1, but the pairing of positive and negative eigenvalues which

leads to tr(5) = 0 does not happen for p .

finite products of a-matrices and in particular the unit operator do not

possess a well dened trace. on the other hand, traces with a p -insertion,

trhbb pi =z dn  h|bb|  i

(3.44)

are much better behaved because the reection  7  removes possible

short distance singularities (reminiscent of ultraviolet divergences in eld

theory) which would plague h|bb|i.

this situation is quite similar to what one encounters in quantum eld

theory in the computation of chiral anomalies or, from a mathematical point

of view, of the analytical index of the dirac operator [34, 35]. there one

considers tr(i) and tr(5) where the trace is over the innite dimensional

hilbert space of dirac spinor elds. while tr(i) does not exist, tr(5) can be

interpreted as the index of the dirac operator.

an important trace of the type (3.44) is

tr[(a1    ap) p (b1    bq)] = ip 2n p! pq a1

(b1a2

b2    ap

bp)

(3.45)

with the convenient abbreviation a  abb, abb = a. eq.(3.45) is similar

to (1.33) for the so(n) -matrices, but contains an additional factor of p

without which the trace would not exist. eq.(3.45) follows from the properties

for the bt -operators. first one uses (3.41) with (3.6) to show that

tr[bt (y)p ] = 2n

48

(3.46)

is independent of y. next one writes

tr[bt (y1)pbt (y2)] = tr[bt (y1)bt (y2)p ]

2 ya

= 2n exp[

2 (y1, y2)] tr[bt (y1  y2)p ]

2]

(3.47)

if one now expands the rst and the last expression of (3.47) in powers of y1

and y2 and equates equal powers, the result is precisely eq.(3.45).

some important special cases of (3.45) include

tr[ap ] = 0

tr[(a1    ap)p ] = 0

tr[abp ] = 2n i ab

(3.48)

the reader is invited to check some of these relations by using the matrix ele-

ments of a in the |i-basis. it is instructive to see that these calculations in-

volve only well dened manipulations of distributions and that no additional ad

hoc regularization is needed. this is dierent from the derivation of the closely

related dimension-counting formulas for the spinors of osp(n|2n) which ap-

pear in certain approaches to the covariant quantization of superstrings [18],

for instance.

3.3 the dirac-kahler construction on phase-space

let (m2n , ) denote an arbitrary 2n-dimensional symplectic manifold which

serves as the phase-space of some hamiltonian system. let us consider the

weyl algebra bundle [30, 31] over m2n . its typical ber is the bosonic weyl

algebra w, i.e. the space of symbols b() equipped with the pointwise product

of functions, the star product, and the inner product (|). at each point 

of m2n we attach a local copy w of w. the matrix (ab) which enters

the denition of the weyl algebra w are the coecients of the symplectic

49

2-form  evaluated at the point . by virtue of darbouxs theorem, there

exist local coordinates (a) such that those coecients assume their canonical

form on the entire (a)-chart. local coordinates on the total space are pairs

(, b) with b a function b : r2n  c, y 7 b(y). the transition functions of

the bundle are dened in such a way the variables (y1,    , y2n ) on which b

depends are the components of a vector y  tm2n , i.e. ya = da(y). a

symplectic change of coordinates a  ea() (canonical transformation) is to
be combined with a transformation in the ber, b eb, such thateb(ey) = b(y)
witheya = (ea/b)yb.

along with the weyl algebra bundle we also consider the metaplectic spinor

bundle over (m2n , ) which we described in the introduction.

its ber at

, v, is a copy of the hilbert space v on which we already constructed a

representation of the metaplectic cliord algebra and, as a consequence, of

the structure group mp(2n).

let us look at sections through the weyl algebra bundle. locally they are

specied by functions  7 b(, )  w where b(, ) : r2n  c, y 7

b(, y) is a weyl symbol living in the ber at .

in this context, the

at auxiliary phase-space r2n is identied with the tangent space tm2n .

hence the function b(, ) is a map from (a part of ) the total space of the

tangent bundle into c.

many of the concepts which we developed in section 3.1 for symbols b 

w naturally pass over to the sections b. at every point  of m2n we can

apply the inverse symbol map to b(, )  w and obtain a unique operator

the points of phase-space. its matrix elements with respect to a given basis

bb() = symb1b(, ) which acts on the local copy v of the hilbert space v.
thus a section b gives rise to a family of operators bb()  l(v) labeled by
  h|bb()|i. globally speaking, bb is a section
in v will be denoted bb()

through the bundle of (1,1)-multispinors [22, 21].

50

the berwise star product of two sections is dened by

(b1  b2) (, y) = b1(, y) expi

2



ya ab




yb b2(, y)

(3.49)

this star product has to be carefully distinguished from the m-product whose

associated moyal bracket {f, g}m = (f m g  g m f )/i replaces the classical

poisson bracket in the deformation quantization approach [24, 36], and which

involves derivatives with respect to a rather than ya.

in general, the m-

product is much more complicated than the -product. it can be constructed

iteratively by fedosovs method [29, 37, 38, 39, 40], but we shall not need it

in the present context.

the berwise inner product of two sections is given by (b1|b2)() = ( b1 

b2)(, 0). the natural sesquilinear form on the space of sections is hb1|b2i =

r dl(b1|b2) where dl is the liouville measure.

after these preparations we are now able to construct an analog of the

dirac-kahler elds on phase-spaces.

let np

sym(t m2n ) denote the p-fold symmetrized tensor power of the
cotangent bundle. a section (p) through this bundle is a symmetric tensor

eld of rank p. we shall also consider the direct sum

osym
its sections  = p

(t m2n ) =

mp=0o p

sym(t m2n )

(3.50)

p=0 (p) are analogous to the inhomogeneous dierential
forms, but with symmetric rather than antisymmetric tensor elds. in local

(darboux) coordinates a,  can be expanded as

() =

1
p!

xp=0

b(p)

a1ap() da1 sym da2 sym    sym dap

(3.51)

with sym denoting the symmetric counterpart of the wedge product; for in-

stance, da sym db = da  db + db  da. the complex-valued coecients

51

b(p)

a1ap are taken to be completely symmetric in all p indices. we shall refer

to  as an inhomogeneous symmetric tensor (ist).

guided by the corresponding construction in the fermionic case we shall

now associate an operator bb()  l(v) to () by replacing in eq.(3.51) the

dierentials da with the gamma-matrices a:

bb() =

=

1
p!

p
p!

xp=0
xp=0

b(p)

a1ap() a1a2    ap

b(p)

a1ap()ba1ba2   bap

(3.52)

(as discussed earlier, we interpret the -matrices as  times the canonical

to a unique ist. the operator can be expanded in the symmetrized monomials

weyl ordered operator on v which admits a power series expansion gives rise

operators ba of the auxiliary quantum system in the ber). conversely, every
b(a1   bap) with coecients which are symmetric tensors and dene an ist
now we form the symbol of bb : b(, y) = [symbbb()](y), i.e.

therefore.

(3.53)

b(, y) =

b(p)

a1ap() ya1ya2    yap

p
p!

xp=0

taking both steps together we arrive at a one-to-one correspondence be-

tween ists and symbols with a power series expansion in y:

() osym

(t 

m2n )  bb()  el(v)  b(, )  fw

(3.54)

this chain of bijections is similar to (2.64). however, the dierence is that

in the fermionic setting every symbol or every weyl ordered operator gives

rise to an inhomogeneous tensor eld. this is not true in the bosonic case.

we have to explicitly restrict the symbols and operators to those which allow

for a power series expansion in ya or ba, respectively. (this is indicated by
the notation el(v) and fw.) nevertheless we shall continue to consider also

52

symbols b which are not analytic in y because they will play a central role in

the reduction of symplectic dk-elds.

now let us look at the rules of the symbol/tensor-correspondence in the

bosonic case. clearly the dierentials da correspond to ya : da  ya.

hence, if we write the (linear, invertible ) map from the symbols to the ists

as b 7 [b], we have [ya] = da or more generally

[pya1    yap] = da1 sym    sym dap

(3.55)

up to this point the situation is the same as in section 2.4 with the commuting

ys replacing the anticommuting s. this converts the wedge product to the

symmetric tensor product. dierences become manifest when we look at the

list of natural operations for ists and their realization at the symbol level.

the automorphism a and the antiautomorphism b, while important for

dealing with the ubiquitous sign factors in exterior algebra computations, are

unnecessary for symmetric tensors. as we argued already, the hodge opera-

tor has a natural bosonic translation, the symplectic fourier transformation.

however it does not leave the space fw invariant and, as a consequence, does

not induce a map of one ist onto another. furthermore, the exterior deriva-

tive is a derivation on the exterior algebra which does not require a connection

for its denition. also this concept has no analog on the bosonic side.

however, every vector eld v = va()a on m2n gives rise to a contraction

operator i(v). by denition, it is a linear operator on the space of ists,

depending linearly on v, and satisfying i(a)1 = 0, i(a)db = b

a as well as

i(v)[1 sym 2] = [i(v)1] sym 2 + 1 sym [i(v)2]

(3.56)

its realization on fw reads

i(v) [b] = [1va 

ya b]

we also dene the operators

ea  i(a),

ea  ab i(b)

53

(3.57)

(3.58)

with the basis vectors a  /a referring to a system of darboux local

coordinates.

the most important properties of the fermionic weyl algebra w f were

the three dierent product structures with which it is endowed and which

make it an atiyah-kahler algebra. the bosonic weyl algebra w is equipped

with three analogous products (pointwise multiplication, star product, inner

product) which satisfy the basic consistency condition (3.32). at the end of

section 3.1 this led us to the conclusion that w is the symplectic counterpart

of an atiyah-kahler algebra. in the same sense the ists  are analogous to

the dirac-kahler elds .

the product structures on w give rise to related products on the space

of symmetric tensor elds. one easily veries that the pointwise product of

bosonic symbols is tantamount to the symmetric tensor product:

[b1] sym [b2] = [b1b2]

(3.59)

furthermore, guided by our experience with the fermionic case, we now

dene the cliord product for symmetric tensor eld as the image of the

bosonic star product under the symbol/tensor correspondence (3.54):

[b1]  [b2] = [b1  b2]

(3.60)

by construction, the symplectic cliord product, also denoted , is asso-

ciative and distributive (but not commutative). from eqs. (3.49), (3.57) and

(3.58) one obtains the following explicit representation for the product of two

ists:

1  2 =

xp=0

ip

p!(cid:2)ea1ea2    eap1(cid:3) sym [ea1ea2    eap2]

(3.61)

this equation is strikingly similar to kahlers formula (1.9) for the ordinary

cliord product. we emphasize that while eq.(3.61) might look complicated

54

it is uniquely determined by the fundamental relations

1  1 = 1

,

1  da = da  1 = da

da  db = da sym db + iab

(3.62)

if associativity and distributivity are imposed.

turning to the last product structure on w, there is an obvious choice for

a berwise inner product (, ) of symmetric tensor elds: (1, 2) = (b1|b2)

where 1,2 is related to b1,2 via (3.54). thus it is clear that the ists may be

regarded as sections through a symplectic atiyah-kahler bundle.

the left-multiplication by the basis element da reads explicitly

da   = da sym  + i ea 

(3.63)

it denes a representation of the symplectic cliord algebra in the space of

inhomogeneous symmetric tensor elds:

da  db  db  da = 2i ab

(3.64)

comparing (3.64) to (3.33), da takes the place of the metaplectic dirac-

matrix a. since da = [ya], da applied to tensors is the same as ya

applied to symbols:

da  [b] = [ya  b]

= [c ab]

(3.65)

the dierential operators c a were introduced in eq.(3.23). they are formally

self-adjoint with respect to the inner product (|). they constitute a repre-

sentation of the symplectic cliord algebra in space of bosonic weyl symbols:

c a c b  c b c a = 2i ab

(3.66)

since ya is the symbol of ba = a, the operator associated to c ab is abb
with bb = symb1(b). in summary, we have the chain of correspondences

(3.67)

da    abb  c ab

55

thus we managed to implement the essence of the dirac-kahler idea in a

symplectic rather than a riemannian setting. we constructed a representation

of the corresponding cliord algebra on the space of symmetric tensor elds

over a phase-space manifold rather than on the exterior algebra over space-

time.

up to this point our considerations focused on the kinematic aspects of the

theory. we have not yet found an analog of the dk-equation. since d and

d do not exist for symmetric tensors, the dk-operator d  d has no direct

counterpart. still it is possible to write down a symplectic dk-equation

with the necessary covariance properties:

[da  a + m] = 0

(3.68)

(here  is a symplectic connection.) this equation could be rewritten as a set

of metaplectic dirac equations in the same way as the ordinary dk-equation

can be decomposed into a set of ordinary dirac equations. metaplectic dirac

operators have been investigated in the mathematical literature recently [41]

but no physical application has emerged so far. in section 4 we shall see that

from a kinematical and representation theory point of view the symplectic

dk-elds indeed do play an important role in the gauge theory approach to

quantization. the interpretation of eld equations such as eq.(3.68), if any,

will remain an open problem though.

we close this section with a few comments on the metaplectic 5-matrix

in relation to the dk-elds. in the so(n)-case we saw that n+1, the volume

form, and the -function are dierent guises of the same object. some proper-

ties of n+1 are similar in the symplectic case, others are quite dierent. the

symbol of p , too, is proportional to a -function,

gp  symb(p ),

gp (y) = ()n (2n )(y)

(3.69)

this symbol is completely unrelated to the volume form, however.

in the

56

so(n)-case we know that the cliord right multiplication by gn+1 is equiva-

lent to the modied hodge operator (f  f  gn+1  f  (n)). this property

has a partial analog since by virtue of (3.21) the symplectic fourier transfor-

mation which corresponds to  is essentially the same operation as the star

multiplication by gp from the right:

eb(y) = 2n (b  gp )(y/2)

however, this statement on the space of symbol functions (including distri-

butions) does not imply a corresponding relation for symmetric tensors. the

symbol gp has no ist associated to it.

the matrix p makes its appearance also in the natural inner product on

l(v). by virtue of the identity

(b1|b2) = 2n trhbb

1 bb2 pi

the inner product on w induces a corresponding product for the operators.

the latter diers form the familiar hilbert-schmidt inner product by the addi-

tional p -matrix which tends to improve the regularity properties of the trace.

eq.(3.71) is most easily proven as follows:

(3.70)

(3.71)

(3.72)

(b1|b2) = ( b1  b2)(y = 0)

= ()nz d2n y ( b1  b2)(y) gp (y)
= ()nz d2n y ( b1  b2  gp )(y)
= ()nz d2n y [symb{bb
1bb2p }](y)
= 2n tr[bb

1bb2p ]

here (3.69) was used along with the standard results [24]r d2n yb1(y)b2(y) =
r d2n y(b1  b2)(y) and tr(bb) = (2)nr d2n y b(y).

57

3.4 decomposition of the symplectic

dk-representation

we have seen that da and ya induce a representation of the symplectic

cliord algebra on the space of symmetric tensors and their symbols, respec-

tively. we also saw that the corresponding representations in the so(n)-case

are reducible, so it is natural to ask if the same is true in the symplectic

setting. we shall demonstrate that at the level of the symbols the represen-

tation is indeed reducible. however, in contradistinction to the so(n)-case,

the decomposition of w does not induce a concomitant decomposition of the

(symmetric) tensor algebra.

we shall see that the representation of the symplectic cliord algebra car-

ried by the symbol-valued elds b(, y) can be decomposed into innitely many

irreducible representations each of which is equivalent to the one dened by

the metaplectic -matrices (3.35). (we recall that this is the representation of

the heisenberg algebra used in conventional canonical quantization.) as a con-

sequence, every eld b(, y) amounts to a collection of innitely many meta-

plectic spinor elds (). now we discuss the question of the (ir)reducibility

for the symbols b, the operators bb and the tensors  separately.

(a) symbols

we are going to show that the bosonic weyl algebra w admits an orthogonal

decomposition

w = mrn

w()

(3.73)

such that the subspaces w() are invariant under star-left multiplication by

ya, i.e. ya  b  w() if b  w(). to this end we use an innite dimensional

generalization of the becher-joos method [3]. we look for a 2n-parameter

58

family of operators bz(y), y  r2n , with the property

ya  bz(y) = bz(y)ba

one should think of bz() as an operator-valued symbol, i.e. the ya in (3.74)
is given by 1c a as if bz was an ordinary symbol. with our experience from
the fermionic case we suspect that bz should be closely related to the weyl

operators. it turns out that this is indeed the case. the derivative of the weyl

operators reads



ya bt (y) =

=

i

1
2

i

yb]bt (y)
ab[bb 
abbt (y) [bb +

1
2

yb]

that left multiplication with ya is equivalent to the operator multiplication by

this equation entails that the argument of bt can be rescaled in such a way
ba, either from the left or from the right:

(3.74)

(3.75)

(3.76)

(3.77)

 =

(3.78)

hence

ya  bt (2iy) =  ibabt (2iy)
ya  bt (2y) = bt (2y)ba
bz(y) = bt (2y) = exp(i yaabb)

is a solution to our problem. in thebx-eigenbasis the matrix elements bz(y)
h|bz|i are given by
bz(y)

i
 yp( + )] (n )(   + 2yq)

they can be used in order to verify that

 = exp[

h|yq  bz(y)|i =  h|bz(y)|i
h|yp  bz(y)|i = i 
h|bz(y)|i



59

(3.79)

which is (3.74) in the position representation.

we shall need the star product of two dierent bz matrix elements. after

some algebra one nds the remarkably simple result

 = 2n (p )

bz(y)

  bz(y) 



 bz(y) 

when combined with the identity bz  = pbzp the above equation at y = 0

gives rise to the inner product

(3.80)

) = 2n (p )   

(3.81)

|,   rn } is a basis
in the space of symbol functions b(). every b  w has an expansion of the

the orthogonality and completeness relations (3.6), (3.7) for bt (y) imply
similar relations for bz(y). as a consequence, {bz()
form b(y) = r dn dn  

 where the coecients 

functions rn  rn  c.

() are actually

()bz(y)

we continue the discussion directly for the case when w is the ber w

and the symbols b() are the w-valued elds b(, ) evaluated at a given point

. eqs. (3.6) and (3.7) imply that b can be expanded as

(bz 
|bz 

and that the expansion coecients are given by

b(, y) =z dn z dn  
()()bz(y)
()() = (/2)nz d2n y b(, y)bz (y)







(3.82)

(3.83)

(3.84)

in a sense which we shall make precise later on, ()  {

();   rn } are the
components of innitely many metaplectic spinors labeled by the index .

if we dene

b()(, y) z dn  

()()bz(y)



so that b(, y) = r dn  b()(, y) then eq.(3.74) implies that the invariant

subspace w() is spanned by precisely the symbols of the type (3.84):

ya  b() = z dn z dn  
() bz 

60



 (ba) 

= z dn  (ba())  bz 





(3.85)

here (ba())  r dn  (ba) 
to the spinor () by (3.84) then ya  b() and ba() are related in the same

way. likewise ya corresponds to a multiplication by a.

(). we see that if the symbol b() is related

given an arbitrary symbol in w we can project it on any of the subspaces

w(). we introduce projection operators p() by b() = p()b. if we combine

eqs. (3.83) and (3.84) it follows that

b()(, y) =z d2n y p()(y, y) b(, y)

where the integral kernel of the projector is given by

p()(y, y) = (/2)n h|bz(y)bz (y)|i

upon using (3.77), (3.5) and (3.9) we obtain explicitly

(3.86)

(3.87)

p()(y, y) = ()n exp[

2i
 ( + yq)(yp  y

p)] (n )(yq  y
q)

(3.88)

the projectors {p();   rn } are orthogonal and complete in the sense that

z d2n y p()(y, y) p( )(y, y) = (n )(  ) p()(y, y)

z dn  p()(y, y) = (2n )(y  y)

(3.89)

furthermore, as a consequence of eq.(3.80), the inner product of two dierent

projections reads

(b(1)|b(2)) = 2n (n )(1  2)z dn  

(1)

(2)

(3.90)

note the sign ip on the lhs of this equation. obviously b() is the natural

dual of b() (similar to a spinor adjoint).

to summarize: every symbol-valued eld b(, y) gives rise to innitely

many projections b()(, y) each of which is equivalent to a metaplectic spinor

eld ()() with components 

()() given by (3.83). this is to mean that the

61

elds () carry an irreducible representation of the cliord algebra: ya  b()

corresponds to the spinor multiplied by a -matrix, a().

up to this point the situation is similar to the so(n)-case, but dierences

will show up shortly.

(b) operators

as in the fermionic case, it proves advantageous to combine the expansion

coecients 

() as a matrix b :
b

  

()  h|b|i

(3.91)

(3.92)

(3.93)

(we suppress the argument  for the time being.) we shall need some prop-

duced earlier. remarkably enough, this symbol plays a dual role: the same

erties of the linear, invertible map b 7 b[b] which relates the symbols to the
new operator b.
by denition, b(y) is the ordinary weyl symbol of the operator bb intro-
tive weyl symbol of the new operator b. this is most easily seen if one uses
bz (y) = bt (2y) in

function but with its argument rescaled, b( 1

2 y), turns out to be the alterna-

b = (/2)nz d2n y b(y)bz (y)
b(y) = tr[bz(y)b]

which follows from the equations in subsection (a), and then compares (3.92),

(3.93) to eqs.(3.10), (3.11). thus,

[symb{bb}](y) = b(y)  [alt-symb{b}](y) = b(

this dual role played by b is another hint at the very natural relationship

1
2

y)

(3.94)

between the dirac-kahler idea and the weyl symbol calculus.

regarding b as a functional of b it is not dicult to establish that

b[1] = 2n p

62

(3.95)

b[ya] = 2n ap
b[ya  b] = ab[b]
b[b1  b2] = 2n b[b1] p b[b2]
b[pya1  ya2      yap] = 2n a1a2    app
b[2yayb] = 2n abp  2n iabp

(3.96)

(3.97)

(3.98)

(3.99)

(3.100)

eq.(3.95) follows directly from the denition of p and eq.(3.97) is our earlier

result (3.85), eq.(3.96) being a special case. the most important relation

is (3.98). it can be proven by using (3.80) and (3.93) in order to show that

implies (3.98).

above we had introduced the projectors p() which project any symbol on

b1b2 = 2n tr{bzb[b1]pb[b2]}. when compared to eq.(3.93), this equation
the invariant subspaces w(). the map b 7 b[b] given by (3.92) induces
a corresponding projection on the space of operators b. in the language of

our auxiliary quantum mechanical system this projection has a very natural

interpretation: it is simply the projection on the position eigenstate |i. from

eq.(3.84) we can read o that b() has the structure of an expectation value

in the state |i

b()(y) = h|bz(y)b[b]|i
= trhbz(y)b[b]bp()i

(3.101)

follows from (3.101) that symbols b  w() are associated to operators of the

here bp()  |ih| is the corresponding projector on the hilbert space.
form bp():

it

(3.102)

b[p()b] = b[b]bp()

finally we have to address the important question of how the operator

b is related to the operator bb which was the central building block in the
dirac-kahler construction. imitating the so(n)-case, we had obtained bb in

63

eq.(3.52) by replacing da  a in the tensor eld . in section 2 we have

seen that for ordinary dk-elds b and bf coincide up to a constant factor. it

is quite remarkable that, with a minor modication, the same identication is

possible in the symplectic situation where v is innite dimensional. it turns

out that

b[b] = 2n bb p

or

bb = 2n b[b] p

this relationship can be proven in a variety of ways. for instance, we can

take advantage of the following very compact representation of operatorsbb in

terms of their symbols b [32]:

(3.103)

(3.104)

bb = 2n (2)nz d2n y b(

1
2

y)bt (y) p

the advantage of (3.104) as compared to the old representation (3.10) is that

no fourier transformation is involved any longer. eq.(3.104) is easily estab-

lished by inserting the integral representation for p on its rhs and then

combining the two weyl operators with the help of (3.5). from eq.(3.104) we

2y) is the alternative
2y) is the alterna-

it is instructive to give a dierent proof when b(y) is a power series. this

is the case for instance when the symbol originates from an ist via the dk-

construction. for bb or b(y) given, the task is to solve b(y) = tr[bz(y)b] for
the unknown operator b. using the expansion (3.53) for b and the (expanded)
exponential (3.77) for bz, this equation turns into
a1ap = ip tr[(a1    ap)b]
in the corresponding calculation for the so(n)-case we made an ansatz for b

as a power series in  and used the -trace identities in order to project on

(3.105)

b(p)

its coecients. because of the additional matrix p in the analogous identities

(3.45) for the metaplectic -matrices the appropriate ansatz for the symplectic

a1ap = 2n b(p)

which proves (3.103). in this manner we see that the factor of p connecting

we discussed already that in the innite dimensional situation the p under

p . with this ansatz in (3.105), the trace identities imply (p)

b is a power series in a (with coecients (p)
b to bb is simply a reection of the corresponding factor in the trace identities.
the p -matrix in (3.103) has the consequence that b does not admit a
power series expansion even if bb does so . this has important implications for

the dirac-kahler program. as we are going to discuss next it means that the

the traces is crucial in order to make them well dened.

decomposition of w into subspaces w() which are invariant under star left

multiplication does not translate into a corresponding decomposition of the

symmetric tensor algebra into subspaces invariant under (symplectic) cliord

left multiplication. in this respect the so(n) and the sp(2n)-cases are quite

dierent.

let us rst look at how the space of operators bb decomposes under w =
l w(). eqs. (3.102) and (3.103) imply that
\p()b = bb p bp() p
= bb bp()

hence, at the level of the bb-operators, the projection p() amounts to a right
multiplication by bp().
symbol on both sides of this equation and abbreviate p()  symbhbp()i then

from eq.(3.106) we can obtain a very useful by-product. if we take the

the result is the following compact formula for the projection b():

(3.106)

p() b  b() = b  p()

(3.107)

more explicitly, because p()(y) = (n )(yq  ), this means that

b()(y) = b(y)  (n )(yq + )

(3.108)

65

by virtue of (3.21) the latter equation can be brought to the following form

which is the most convenient one for practical calculations:

b()(yp, yq) = b(cid:18)yp 

i
2


 yq

, yq(cid:19) (n )(yq + ) |yq=yq

(3.109)

as usual, y  (yp, yq) consists of n-component momentum- and position-type

variables yp and yq.

the structure of b() is particularly transparent if b(y)  b(yq) does not

depend on the momenta. then its projection on w() reads

b()(y) = b(yq) (n )(yq + ),

(3.110)

i.e., it is sharply localized at yq = .

if b depends also on yp there are

additional terms involving derivatives of (n )(yq + ). nevertheless, as long as

b depends on y polynomially, the projected symbol b() has support only on

the hyperplane yq = . this localization of the symbols makes it very easy

to visualize the -subspace of w. in fact, this intuitive interpretation of w()

is the reason why we are using thebx-eigenbasis on v rather than the harmonic

oscillator (fock space) basis which yields the traditional representation of the

a-matrices.

(c) inhomogeneous symmetric tensors

we know that every symbol-valued eld b(, y) gives rise to innitely many

projections b()  w() each of which is equivalent to a spinor (). on

w(),

ya  b() corresponds to a() and it represents the cliord alge-

bra irreducibly. on the other hand, in section 3.3 we dened the symplectic

cliord product as the image of the star product under the symbol/tensor-

correspondence (3.54). it is a natural question therefore whether the represen-

tation of the cliord algebra provided by da on the space of symmetric

tensors is reducible as well.

at this point we have to recall that the symbol/tensor-correspondence

66

(3.54) is a bijection between tensors () and symbols b(, y) which are an-

alytic in y. only if b allows for a power series expansion in y the substitution

ya  da yields a tensor eld. as for the question of the reducibility, the

crucial observation is that even if b(, y) is analytic in y, the projections

b()(, y) are not in general. this is obvious from eq.(3.109) which shows

that b() is typically a distribution with a sharp localization (in the auxiliary

phase-space) on the plane yq = .

therefore we must conclude that the decomposition of the bosonic weyl

algebra w = l w() does not imply a corresponding decomposition of the

space of ists. this was dierent in the fermionic case where the analyticity

of f (x, ) comes for free and where symbol-valued elds and inhomogeneous

dierential forms are two completely equivalent concepts.

from these observations we can learn what the correct notion of a sym-

plectic dirac-kahler eld actually is. traditionally, in the so(n)-case, a

dk-eld meant a set of (antisymmetric) tensor elds. this is a historic acci-

dent, however, and one could have talked equally well about w f-valued elds

over space-time. when we go from space-time to phase-space and from so(n)

to sp(2n) we see that the notion which generalizes is not that of a collection

(of now symmetric) tensor elds but rather the idea of weyl symbol-valued

elds. on phase-space the elds b(, y), with a not necessarily analytic de-

pendence on y, play a role which is completely analogous to that of f (x, ) on

space-time. the former is equivalent to a set of mp(2n)-spinors in very much

the same way as the latter gives rise to a multiplet of spin(n)-spinors.

4 summary and discussion

in the rst part of this paper we have shown that the theory of space-time

dk-fermions allows for a remarkably simple and natural reinterpretation in

the framework of the symbol calculus. more precisely, it is the fermionic weyl

67

symbol which is to be used here. this symbol was employed in the context

of rst quantized particle and string theory occasionally, but so far it has

not reached the popularity of the wick symbol which is commonly chosen for

fermionic systems.

we have set up a one-to-one correspondence between dk-elds (x) and

symbol-valued elds f (x, ) by associating a family of auxiliary quantum sys-

tems, with canonical operatorsb and anticommuting phase-space coordinates
, to each point x of space-time. the fermionic operators b and grassmann

variables  replace the dirac matrices  and the dierentials dx, respec-

tively. the nontrivial aspect of this correspondence is that it maps all the

natural operations which we know for dierential forms onto equally natu-

ral and well known operations for symbols. for instance, the star product

which is at the heart of every symbol calculus turned out to be related to the

cliord product, a pivotal concept in standard dk-theory, in precisely this

manner. more generally, we were able to identify all the dening structures of

an atiyah-kahler algebra on the space of fermionic weyl symbols.

our approach provides some new computational tools for calculations in-

volving dk-elds, an integral representation of the cliord product, for exam-

ple. more importantly, it sheds new light on the geometrical meaning of various

constructions in the standard approach. for instance, the matrix-valued form

z has turned out to be nothing but a fermionic weyl operator.

in the second part of this paper we developed a symplectic analog of dk-

theory. we replaced space-time by phase-space, the lorentz group so(n) by

sp(2n), dirac elds by metaplectic spinors, and we then asked if there exists

a corresponding notion of a dk-eld. the answer turned out to be in the ar-

mative, but with some qualications. the crucial step in our construction was

switching from the fermionic auxiliary quantum system to a bosonic one whose

basic operators ba satisfy canonical commutation relations and thus realize the

68

symplectic cliord algebra. using the riemannian situation as a guide line

we formulated the auxiliary quantum theory in terms of (now bosonic) weyl

symbols. we argued that it is the symbol-valued elds b(, y) which deserve

the name of a symplectic dirac-kahler eld. the elds with an analytic

dependence on y are equivalent to a set of symmetric tensor elds, the sym-

plectic counterpart of an inhomogeneous dierential form. we described in

detail which properties of the standard dk-elds pass over to the symplectic

case and which dont. we discovered for example that all the dening struc-

tures of an atiyah-kahler algebra have analogs in the symplectic setting. in

particular, the bosonic weyl star product gives rise to a cliord product.

it is an interesting feature of this method that both the ordinary and the

symplectic cliord product arise as a quantum deformation (in the sense of

[24]) of the corresponding tensor product (wedge product and sym), the de-

formation parameter being  or 2.7

the most important dierences between the riemannian and the symplec-

tic case occur when it comes to decomposing the representation of the cliord

algebra carried by the symbol-valued elds. while the decomposition of the

bosonic weyl algebra into left invariant subspaces can be carried out along

the same lines as for the fermionic algebra, it does not induce a corresponding

decomposition of the space of inhomogeneous symmetric tensor elds. the

reason is that the projection on the invariant subspaces does not respect the

analyticity of b(, y) which is necessary for a tensor interpretation. we take

this as a hint that it is actually the concept of a weyl-algebra-valued eld

which is at the heart of dk-theory, both on space-time and on phase-space,

rather than the idea of inhomogeneous (anti)symmetric tensors. the elds

b(, y) are equivalent to a multiplet of metaplectic spinors in the same way

an ordinary dk-eld is equivalent to a multiplet of dirac spinors.

7in order to make this explicit at the tensor level one should refrain from the convenient

rescaling of the tensor components by factors of .

69

let us close with a few additional comments.

we begin with a remark on what it precisely means that a dk-eld is

equivalent to a set of spinor elds. this remark applies to so(n) and

sp(2n) dk-elds alike. strictly speaking, a metaplectic spinor is dened by

its transformation properties under local sp(2n)-transformations, the phase-

space analog of the local lorentz-transformations8. let us x some point  of

m2n and let us change the basis in its tangent space tm2n by means of a

symplectic matrix s()  [s()a

b]. this induces a corresponding unitary trans-

of a vector and a spinor transform as ya  (s1)a

formation m(s)  mp(2n) in the local hilbert space v. the components
,
respectively. it is important to observe that the spinors contained in a dk-

byb and   m(s)

eld b(, y) do not individually transform in this manner. in fact, as a direct

consequence of (1.2) the bz-operator transforms according to

m(s) bz(y) m(s) = bz(s1y)

therefore eq.(3.93) reads in the rotated basis

b(, s1y) = trhbz(y) m(s)b() m(s)i

()) does not transform as a set of independent spinors

this means that b  (

labeled by the index . the index , too, is acted upon by a spin matrix:

(4.1)

(4.2)

(4.4)


()  m(s)



 

() m (s)

(4.3)

for space-time dk-elds this is a well known phenomenon which is referred

to as avor mixing [3]. among other things it implies that dk-fermions have

a nonstandard coupling to gravity [2, 42, 6]. the curved-space dirac equation

for a massless dk-eld reads

8see ref.[21] for a detailed discussion of those transformation properties and of the vielbein

formalism for phase-spaces.

 [ij ,b](cid:17) = 0

70

if b was a set of independent spinors the spin connection ij
b from the left only. the avor mixing caused by the commutator is weak

in the newtonian limit of gravity and most probably cannot be excluded on

 ij multiplied

experimental grounds [42].

finally let us comment on the relation of the symplectic dk-elds to the

gauge theory formulation of quantum mechanics [21] which was proposed re-

cently. its basic ingredient is a family of local hilbert spaces9 v attached to

the points of phase-space. this theory resulted from an attempt at under-

standing the principles of canonical quantization at a perhaps deeper or at

least physically and geometrically more natural level.

the theory is a yang-mills-type gauge theory on phase-space. its matter

elds are metaplectic spinors (). canonical quantization is replaced by

two new rules. the rst one is that in order to go from classical mechanics to

semiclassical quantum mechanics we must switch from the vector representa-

tion of sp(2n) to its spinor representation. the second rule is a consistency

condition which tells us how to sew together local semiclassical expansions so as

to recover exact quantum mechanics. it is formulated as symmetry principle:

the yang-mills theory must be invariant under a new type of background-

quantum split symmetry. as it turns out, this implies that the gauge eld is

a universal, nondynamical abelian connectione.10

the upshot of this construction is the following two-step procedure for the

quantization of physical systems on arbitrary curved phase-spaces m2n :

(1) find an abelian spin connectione on m2n . it is guaranteed to exist on

any symplectic manifold and can be constructed iteratively by fedosovs

9 for dierent formulations of quantum (eld) theory using local hilbert spaces see refs.

[43, 31, 44]

10the gauge group is the group of all unitary transformations on v and the connection

components ea are hermitian operators. being abelian means that the curvature of e is

proportional to the unit operator on v.

71

method [29, 30, 38].

(2) construct (multi) spinor elds which are covariantly constant (possibly

up to a phase) with respect to the connectione. they are local general-

izations of states and observables.

in particular, states are represented by a covariantly constant spinor eld

(). if the value of this eld is known at a xed reference point 0 it is known

everywhere in phase-space (up to a physically irrelevant phase). the wave

function  of conventional quantum mechanics is identied with (0) 

(). for further details we refer to [21].

this approach reveals that, in a sense, classical mechanics is related to

quantum mechanics in the same way tensor elds (integer spin) relate to spinor

elds (half-integer spin) or space-time bosons relate to fermions. what is at

the heart of the quantization process is changing the representation of sp(2n),

the lorentz group of phase-space.

according to the proposal of ref. [21] this change of representation, while

very natural from a particle physics point of view, still has to be done by

hand in the same sense as in the standard approach the canonical commu-

tation relations are imposed by hand. one might wonder if there is more

natural way of describing this change of representation, and it is here that

dirac-kahler theory comes into play. dk-theory certainly cannot explain why

nature has decided to pick the spinor representation of sp(2n) but it can put

this question into a novel and perhaps somewhat unexpected perspective.

the symplectic dk-elds give a precise meaning to the idea that classical

mechanics contains the basic building blocks of quantum mechanics, namely

the metaplectic spinor elds. on the one hand, the dk-elds b(, y) belong to

the realm of classical mechanics in the sense that they are c-number functions

on the classical tangent bundle. on the other hand, b(, y) is equivalent

to a family of spinor elds () = (

()) whose members are labelled by the

72

avor index . quantum mechanics is a theory whose basic ingredient is

a single metaplectic spinor eld. this leads us to conclude that the process

of quantization can be understood as the elimination of all but one avor of

metaplectic spinors, i.e. as a projection on a xed -subspace11.

in the same sense as above, this projection has to be done by hand12.

however, with this interpretation, there is an almost perfect analogy between

the following two problems which are usually thought of as belonging to rather

dierent branches of physics: the construction of a lattice theory which de-

scribes a single species of fermions, and the quantization of physical systems

in general. on the riemannian (or space-time) side, the question is how to

avoid the fermion replication which results from the kogut-susskind action,

and the corresponding symplectic (or phase-space) problem is how to obtain a

quantum theory from classical structures. at a heuristic level, the solution to

both problems is exactly the same: one must project out a single spinor from

a dirac-kahler eld. whether this is merely a formal similarity or whether

space-time fermions can teach us something about the general structure of

quantum mechanics remains to be seen.

11note, however, that covariantly constant dk-elds do not amount to covariantly con-

stant projected spinor elds. the reason is the avor mixing: the condition (e)b = 0
involves a commutator ofe with b, while (e) = 0 contains only a left-multiplication by
e.

12we mention that also the approach of ref.

[45] constructs quantum mechanics from

functions on the classical tangent bundle by imposing certain constraints. this approach

does not involve metaplectic spinors, however, and the dk-construction seems not to answer

the questions raised there.

the (modied) hodge operator is closely related to the grassmann fourier

tions

this is an interesting representation of the hodge operator, because in con-

trast to (a.33), eq.(a.44) continues to be meaningful if we regard  as a

the metaplectic dk-elds.

appendix b

in this appendix we derive several important representations of the fermionic

star product, eqs. (2.15), (2.16) and (2.17), from the integral representation

(2.14).

we start by shifting 1 and 2 in eq.(2.14):

(f1  f2)() = n(cid:18) 

2i(cid:19)nz exp(cid:18) 2

 12(cid:19) f1(1 + )f2(2 + ) dn1dn2 (b.1)

next we taylor-expand f1 and f2 with respect to 1 and 2. because the

exponential produces only terms with equal numbers of 1s and 2s, only

those terms in the product of the two taylor series survive the integration

which contain equal numbers as well:

(f1  f2)() = n(cid:18) 

2i(cid:19)n nxp=0(cid:18) 1

p!(cid:19)2z exp(cid:18) 2

 . because

here e  

(12    p)(12    p) = (1)p(12    p)(12    p)

(b.3)

for two arbitrary sets of mutually anticommuting grassmann-odd objects, we

may use eqs. (a.7) and (a.14) to write

1    p

where sp is the symmetric group of p objects. the constants (n, p) are most
easily determined by choosing the special index combination j 12p

12p for which

only the identical permutation contributes in (b.9). furthermore, the summa-

tion over  in (b.8) is restricted to  > p then:

(b.10)

(n, p) =

commuting the s next to the corresponding ds produces various sign factors

so that nally

(n, p) = (1)n(1)n(n1)/2(1)p(p1)/2 p!(n  p)!

(b.11)

if we note that nin(1)n(n1)/2 = 1 both for n even and n odd, we see that

inserting (b.12) into (b.5) we obtain precisely the nal result given in eq.(2.15)

of the main text.

the representation (2.16) follows from (2.15) by using (a.12) in order to

convert the left derivatives which act on f1 to right derivatives. one also needs

(a.8) to switch from the index sequence (1, 2,    , p) to (p, p1,    , 1).

the last representation, eq.(2.17), follows from (2.16) by commuting left

and right derivatives with the same index next to each other. no sign factor

is picked up during this reshuing.
