abstract

we calculate the conformal anomaly from 5d weyl gravity (with broken
conformal symmetry) which is conjectured to be supergravity dual to n = 2
superconformal eld theory via ads/cft correspondence. its comparison
with n = 2 scft conformal anomaly (uv calculation) suggests that such
duality may exist subject to presence of sub-leading 1/n corrections to cos-
mological and gravitational constants.

(1)

for years, weyl gravity attracts the attention as an alternative theory
of gravity. there have been suggested mechanisms how to get usual general
relativity (low energy behavior) from it, for example, via breaking of weyl
(or conformal) invariance.

even if weyl gravity itself is not realistic theory it can be important as
an essential element of other models. an example of that sort is provided by
string theory. according to refs.[1] there exists a scheme where the string-
frame metric and dilaton dependent terms in low energy string action are
given by

here c1  3 and w (r)  c 4
. this is caused by the eld redenition
ambiguity [2] which allows to change the coecients of terms with ricci
tensor. in ref.[3] above action has been used to calculate strong coupling limit
free energy for n = 4 super yang-mills theory via ads/cft correspondence
(for an introduction, see [4]).
the usual form of weyl gravity is given by the square of the weyl tensor

cc 

in ve dimensions,

s = cz d5xgcc  .

cc  =

r2 

4
3

rr + rr .

(2)

(3)

since weyl tensor is, of course, invariant under the weyl transformation:

g  e2g ,

(4)

the action (2) is weyl invariant. the invariance is broken if we include the
einstein and cosmological terms:

s = z d5xg(cid:26) 1

2 r   + ccc (cid:27) .

(5)

the string theory dual to n = 2 superconformal eld theory is presum-
ably iib string on ads5  x5 [5] where x5 = s5/z2. (the n = 2 sp(n)
theory arises as the low-energy theory on the world volume on n d3-branes
sitting inside 8 d7-branes at an o7-brane).

(6)

the riemann curvature squared term in the above bulk action may be de-
duced from heterotic string via heterotic-type i duality [6]. using eld re-
denition ambiguity [2] one can suppose that there exists the scheme where
r2
 may be modied to c 2
 in the same way as in ref.[1]. then, the
action (5) is presumably the bulk action dual to n = 2 scft.
our purpose here will be to check this conjecture, comparing the confor-
mal anomaly in sp(n) n = 2 scft (uv calculation) and the conformal
anomaly derived from the action (5) via ads/cft correspondence (sg side)
[7].

within ads/cft correspondence, the weyl anomaly in 4 dimensions
has been calculated from the 5 dimensional higher derivative action in [8].
in the conjecture of ads/cft correspondence, the partition function in d-
dimensional conformal eld theory is given in terms of the classical action in
d + 1-dimensional gravity theory:

zd(0) = esads(classical(0)) .

(7)

here 0 is the value of the eld  on the boundary and classical(0) is a eld
on bulk background, which is ads, given by solving the equations of motion

with the boundary value 0 on m d.sads(cid:16)classical(0)(cid:17) is the classical gravity

action on ads. when we substitute the classical solution into the action,
the action, in general, contains infrared divergences coming from the innite
volume of ads. then we need to regularize the infrared divergence.
it is
known that as a result of the regularization and the renormalization there
often appear anomalies. as uctuations around the anti de sitter space, we
assume the metric has the following form:

ds2  gdxdx =
gij = 1gij .

l2

2dd +

d

xi=1

gijdxidxj

(8)

we should note that there is a redundancy in the expression of (8). in fact,
if we reparametrize the metric :

 =  , gij = gij .

(9)

3

by a constant parameter , the expression (8) is invariant. the transfor-
mation (9) is nothing but the scale transformation on md. we expand the
metric gij as a power series with respect to ,

gij = g(0)ij + g(1)ij + 2g(2)ij +    .

(10)

we regard g(0)ij in (10) as independent eld on md. we can solve g(l)ij
(l = 1, 2,  ) with respect to g(0)ij using equations of motion. when sub-
stituting the expression (10) into the classical action, the action diverges in
general since the action contains the innite volume integration on md+1.
we regularize the infrared divergence by introducing a cuto parameter :

z dd+1x  z ddxz

d , zmd

then the action can be expanded as power serie of :

ddx(cid:16)  (cid:17)  z ddx (cid:16)  (cid:17)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)=

.

(11)

s = s0(g(0)ij) d

2 + s1(g(0)ij, g(1)ij) d

2

1

+   + sln ln  + s d

2

+ o(

1

2 ) .

(12)

the term sln proportional to ln  appears when d =even. in (12), the terms
proportional to the inverse power of  in the regularized action are invariant
under the scale transformation

g(0) = 2g(0) ,  = 2 .

(13)

the invariance comes from the redanduncy (9). the subtraction of these
terms proportional to the inverse power of  does not break the invariance.
when d is even, however, there appears the term sln proportional to ln .
the subtraction of the term sln breaks the invariance under the transforma-
tion(13). the reason is that the variation of the ln  term under the scale
transformation (13) is nite when   0 since ln   ln  + ln(2). there-
fore the variation should be canceled by the variation of the nite term s d
(which does not depend on )

2

s d

=  ln(2)sln

(14)

since the original total action (16) is invariant under the scale transforma-
tion. since the action s d
can be regarded as the action renormalized by the

2

subtraction of the terms which diverge when   0, the ln  term sln gives
the conformal anomaly t of the renormalized theory on the boundary md:

sln =

the sign in front of the root in the above equation may be chosen to be
positive which corresponds to the einstein gravity (a = b = c = 0). we also
used the gauss-bonnet invariant g and the square of the 4d weyl tensor f ,
which are given by

for the n = 2 theory with the gauge group sp(n), the usual uv weyl

comparing (20) and (22), we nd that the anomaly in (20) can be reproduced
if

2 and/or  would be necessary.

the second equation in (23) is, however, not compatible with (6), where
l3
2 = n 2
42 since l = 1 from (21). this might suggest that some sub-leading
corrections to 1
in other words, the bulk
action (5) may be dual to n = 2 sp(n) theory subject that some sub-leading
corrections are induced to 1
2 (in minimal case) and to c. (one example of
such sort is given by eqs.(23) with l = 1 and cosmological constant equal
to 12 of inverse gravitational constant.) the mechanism to produce such
corrections is not yet clear. one possibility is that they come from eld
redenitions.

in [9], the free energy of the corresponding n = 2 theory has been calcu-

lated from the weyl gravity side (corresponding ads black hole)

f = v3(cid:18)

by substituting (23) into (24) and xing l to be unity, we obtain

(24)

(25)

on the other hand, from the eld theoretical viewpoint (uv calculation of
free energy in corresponding quantum eld theory), we obtain

f =

the coecient 17
8 of next-to-leading term in (25) is approximately 2 in the
corresponding one in (26) besides the usual overall factor 4
3. such close
correspondence indicates again that weyl gravity action under discussion is
indeed supergravity dual of super ym theory with two supersymmetries.

in case of n = 4 theory, the term proportional to (g + f ) does not
appear in the weyl anomaly. this requires c = 0. therefore the anomaly in
n = 4 theory cannot be reproduced only by the squared weyl tensor term.
more generally we can consider the n = 2 sp(n) theory with nv = 2n 2+
n vectormultiplets and n sets of (nh = (2n 2 + 7n  1)n hypermultiplets

(28)

we again come to the same conclusion: bulk action (5) may be dual to
n = 2 scft subject to existance of sub-leading corrections to 1
2 and/or
. another alternative could be the presence of some extra terms (elds) in
action (5). that requires very careful investigation of string eective action.
