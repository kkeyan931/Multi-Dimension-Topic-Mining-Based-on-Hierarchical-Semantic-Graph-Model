abstract

a unied and fully relativistic treatment of the interaction of the elec-

tric and magnetic dipole moments of a particle with the electromagnetic

eld is given. new forces on the particle due to the combined eect of

electric and magnetic dipoles are obtained. four new experiments are

proposed, three of which would observe topological phase shifts.

a beautiful aspect of electromagnetism, which is becoming increasingly fun-

damental, is the duality between electric and magnetic elds.

it is therefore

natural to extend the many interesting facets of the inuence of the electro-

magnetic eld on the magnetic dipole [1-7] to the dual situations [8, 9]. in this

letter, i shall give a model independent and fully relativistic derivation of the

low energy lagrangian for the electromagnetic interaction of the electric and

magnetic dipoles [10]. new forces on the dipole will be obtained using the non

abelian nature of the interaction [4, 5, 6]. i shall then propose new feasible ex-

periments to test this interaction, three of which would have topological aspects

analogous to the aharonov-bohm (ab) eect [11].

the simplest classical lorentz invariant action for a particle of mass m in-

teracting with the electromagnetic eld strength f is

i = z mcds 

1

2c z f d ds

(1)

where s is the proper time along the particles world- line. for simplicity the

total electric and magnetic charges of the particle have been assumed to be

zero. d may be taken to be anti-symmetric without loss of generality, and

will be called the dipole moment tensor. more generally, i = r lds, where

l is a lorentz scalar that is an analytic function of f . in the power series

expansion of l in f , the sum of the rst and higher order terms corresponds

to the last term in (1). in the corresponding power series for d, the term that

is independent of f is called the intrinsic dipole moment and the remainder

is called the induced dipole moment.

in any frame, d0i and dij , that couple, respectively, to the electric eld

components f0i and the magnetic eld components fij, are called the compo-

nents of the electric and magnetic dipoles. in the rest frame of the particle, d0i

and dij represent the intrinsic electric and magnetic dipole moments, much

like the energy in the rest frame representing the mass of the particle. these

may be covariantly represented, respectively, by the electric and magnetic dipole

which reects that only three components of each dipole moment vector are

independent, because in the rest frame (v = (1, 0, 0, 0)) each vector has only

three (spatial) components.

the electric and magnetic elds in the rest frame may also be covariantly dened

by

then ev = 0 = bv. in the rest frame, e = (0, e) and b = (0, b), where

e and b are the electric and magnetic (spatial) vectors, in the usual notation.

then (4) reads

f d = de + mb

on dening the 1-form elds,

d = df , m = mf 

(4) may also be rewritten as

f d = dv + mv = av

clearly then, the duality between the interactions of the electric and magnetic

dipoles is complete to all orders of v/c indepenently whether or not there are

magnetic monopoles. each of the last two terms in (9)is analogous to the elec-

tromagnetic interaction term ea

dx
dt

in the lagrangian for a charged particle,

where the 1form a is the electromagnetic potential. this immediately sug-

gests topological eects analogous to the ab eect [11], which will be considered

later.

when the lagrangian is quantized, the phase shift that the particle experi-

ences due to the the electromagnetic eld, using the action (1), and (8), is given

by the phase factor

p exp(

i

2ch z

f dds) = p exp(

i

hc z

adx)

(10)

where p represents path ordering because d , d, m and therefore a are now

operators which need not commute. for a topological phase, the eect of (10) on

the wave function should not change when  is deformed in a suitable region.

such a deformation may be obtained by innitesimal deformations. to see

the eect of an innitesimal deformation, consider (10) around an innitesimal

closed curve spanning a surface element d :

(12)

an external eld modies the motion of a wave function, via huyghens

principle, by the phase shift that it causes in the interference of secondary

wavelets. this gives a relativistic correspondence principle that enables the

classical equation of motion to be determined from the phase shift around an

innitesimal closed curve [13]. let (t) = (t, < (t)|xi|(t) >) represent the

world-line of a wave- packet |(t) > of the particle. then for a suitably localized

wave packet,

to a good approximation, where s now is the proper time along the above world-

line. eq. (13) has been obtained in the low energy limit, to o(1/c), by writing

d < xi > /dt and d2 < xi > /dt2 in terms of the commutators of the hamiltonian

[5]. then lorentz covariance implies that it is valid to all orders in 1/c. a purely

classical derivation of (13), with the expectation values replaced by classical

quantities, may be obtained by replacing the above quantum commutators by

appropriate poisson brackets of the relativistic classical hamiltonian. (13) is

also analogous to the force on a yang-mills particle obtained in the classical

limit of the diracs equation by wong [14].

(11) and (13) show that g determines both whether the phase shift is

topological (i.e. whether (10) is unchanged when  is varied) and non local (the

force on the interfering beams is zero). if

g = 0

(14)

everywhere in a non simply connected region to which the interfering beams are

conned, then the phase shift will be called strongly topological or non local.

the phase shift will be called weakly topological or non local if

< |g | >= 0

(15)

it is interesting that the last term in (1), which previously was regarded as

a non gauge interaction, may be regarded as a gauge interaction in the fully

relativistic theory because of the identity (8). hence, the topological and geo-

metrical phases implied by the lagrangian (9) are also valid to all orders in 1/c,

unlike in earlier treatments. i shall now make a low energy approximation by

neglecting terms of o(1/c2). from (7), the parts of d and m that contribute

to l in this approximation are

d = (d  e, d  b), m = (  b,   e), a = m + d

(16)

the lagrangian is then obtained in this approximation from (9), after subtract-

5

ing the rest mass energy, to be [15]

l =

(19)

the force is

(20)

this gives the force to be the same as the spatial components of (13), in the

present limit.

suppose now that the dipole is made of two particles with charges q, q,

masses m1, m2 and coordinates x1, x2 . it can be shown that the oribital angular

momentum of the system

x1  p1 + x2  p2 = x  (p1 + p2) + r  p

(21)

where x = (m1 + m2)1(m1x1 + m2x2) is the center of mass, r = x1  x2 the
relative coordinates, and p = (m1 + m2)1(m2p1  m1p2). then p satises

[pi, rj] = ihij and [pi, xj ] = 0. the last term in (21), l  r  p, is the

total orbital angular momentum about the center of mass, and is invariant

under galilei boosts.

it satises [li, lj] = ihijklk, [li, rj ] = ihijkrk, and

[li, xj ] = 0.

in general, the magnetic moment

 = ll + ss

(22)

where s is the total spin. the electric dipole moment d = qr. it follows that

[i, j] = ihijk(l

in the rest frame of the dipole, i.e. a frame in which (19) is zero, from (13),

f 0 = 0 and f i =< |gi

(24) may also be obtained from (20). , d. s and l in (24), quantum mechan-

ically, are expectation values of the corresponding operators. the force in an

arbitrary inertial frame may be obtained by lorentz transforming the above f 

to this frame. of the terms in (24) that are non linear in the electromagnetic

eld, 2

s(s  b)  e was previously obtained by the author [5, 6] and may

be experimentally detectable [16]. the remaining three non linear terms are

new. of particular interest are the last two terms in (24), which are due to the

combined eect of the electric and magnetic dipole moments.

an experiment that would detect a topological eect due to d0, which is

analogous to the scalar ab eect [11], is the following. split a beam of iden-

tical neutral particles with electric dipole moment d, but no magnetic dipole

moment, into two, and send one beam between a pair of capacitor plates that

are both initially neutral. the beam is so weak that at most one particle is

inside the capacitor at any given time. the beam is also polarized so that d is

parallel to the electric eld in the capacitor. when each particle is inside the

capacitor turn on the homogeneous electric eld of the capacitor and turn it

o before the particle leaves the capacitor plate. then the phase shift due to

d0 is [18] (1/h)r t

0 d  bdt = (bt d/h). this is analogous to
the experiment to detect the topological phase shift due to m0 proposed from

0 d0dt = (1/h)r t

dierent points of view by zeilinger [17] and the author [6], which has been

observed [19, 20].

in the above two experiments, as in the interference of magnetic moment

around a line charge considered by aharonov and casher [2], it is the expectation

value of the quantum force operator, or the classical force, that vanishes, whereas

7

the quantum force, m(d2 xi/dt2), is non zero [21]. for example, in the second

of the above three experiments [17, 6], the linear terms in the quantum force

equation. but the non linear term 2

vanish because of the homogeneity of the magnetic eld, on using a maxwells
s(s  b)  e does not vanish. it is the
expectation value of the latter term, or the corresponding classical force term,

that vanishes. all three experiments are weakly topological because, along the

interfering beams, (15) holds whereas (14) does not hold. this is analogous to

the stern-gerlach experiment with the spin perpendicular to the inhomogeneity

of the magnetic eld for which also (15) holds whereas (14) does not hold. in

the latter experiment the existence of the quantum force is obvious because

it splits the beam into two, even though the classical force is zero. on the

other hand, the ab eect [11] is strongly topological, as dened above, because

g = ef = 0.

however, in the following proposed experiments (14) holds, and hence the

quantum force is zero and the phase shifts are strongly topological and non

local. subject the entire interferometer to a homogeneous electric or magnetic

eld. along each beam the magnetic or electric dipole moment is rotated by

1800 and is rotated back again by 1800 by suitable oscillating elds after the

beams have traveled distances l1 and l2, respectively. the contributions to

the phase shift, which depends on l1  l2, due to the dipole ips on one beam

is canceled by the ones in the other beam by doing them identically.

the most sensitive method for detecting the electric dipole interaction is

by the electric resonance method described by ramsey [22]. here a polarized

molecular beam is deected and refocused by two inhomogeneous electric elds.

in between, a homogeneous and oscillatory electric elds are applied. the elds

are chosen so that an allowed electric dipole transition occurs due to the latter

elds which makes the intensity of the refocused beam maximum. a magnetic

eld b is then introduced in the intermediate region so that v  b is in the

direction of the homogeneous electric eld. this shifts the intensity from the

8

maximum which can easily be detected.
