we give a path integral prescription for the pair correlation function
of wilson loop observables on the worldvolume of a dbrane in the
bosonic string theory in at spacetime. we determine the coecient
of the 1/r term in the static heavy quark potential from the static pair
correlation function of wilson lines at small spatial separation in the
critical string theory. we verify that the pair correlation function of
short loops at xed time and large spatial separation has the expected
coulombic form for the d-instanton potential.

1 introduction

it is an old idea due to wilson [1] that the expectation value of the loop
observable in qcd has an eective description at low energies as a sum over
random surfaces with xed boundary, c, of an appropriate two-dimensional
eld theory:

< w (c) >  < tr p exp(igy m ic

dx a) >  zstring[c]

,

(1)

where c is the world-line of a heavy quark-antiquark pair, <    > denotes
the averaging over gauge eld congurations, and the quarks are treated as
semi-classical objects [1, 2]. zstring[c] denotes the sum over world-sheets ter-
minating on a xed curve c in spacetime of some string theory: an o-shell
string amplitude with a macroscopic hole in the world-sheet. in the gauge
theory, < w (c) >ese.[c], is characterized by an area law for large loops
widely separated, quark-antiquark world-lines, with crossover to a perimeter
law for long, closely separated, world-lines [1]. this behavior is characteristic
of a large class of classical string theories [1, 3, 4]. dbranes [5] in at space-
time provide a concrete framework within which the ansatz can be tested
at the quantum level directly in string/m theory. the gauge theory loops
are taken to lie in the p+1 dimensional worldvolume of a dpbranea hyper-
surface in a higher dimensional spacetime, on which open string endpoints
terminate.
in the nonabelian case, each loop lives in an n index chan-
paton state of an open and closed string theory, where the index labels the
worldvolumes of n coincident dpbranes.

in this paper, we will give a path integral prescription for the pair corre-
lation function of macroscopic loop observables, m(ci), m(cf ), in bosonic
string theory, following [6, 7, 8, 9]:

a dieomorphism invariant sum over world-sheets of cylindrical topology ter-
minating on xed boundary curves, ci, cf , which are taken to lie in the
worldvolume of a dbrane in at spacetime. s[x, gab] is the polyakov ac-
tion, with appropriate bulk and boundary terms as necessary to preserve
dieomorphism invariance. we will compute this amplitude at the lowest
order in bosonic string perturbation theory, neglecting o(gopen) corrections
from splitting, and o(g2

in the critical spacetime dimension, and for boundary conditions that pre-
serve weyl invariance, the path integral gives a covariant prescription for the
o-shell propagator in the critical closed string theory [9]. explicit results
were obtained for pointlike boundary states in [9], but an implementation of
boundary reparameterization for nite sized loops has been lacking thus far.
we will give an ansatz for the sum over boundary reparameterizations in eq.
(2), deriving an expression for the pair correlation function of loops, ci, cf ,
of perimeter length, li, lf , and with constant separation, r. later, we will
specialize to the case when li, lf >> r, extracting the static limit of an
eective loop potential at small separations in critical string theory.

we begin in section 2 with a discussion of our prescription for boundary
reparameterization invariance. a boundary state is specied by an embed-
ding and an einbein. for xed embedding, we give a boundary dieomor-
phism invariant prescription for the measure in the path integral, summing
over reparameterizations of the boundary. the gauge xed path integral is
derived in detail in sections 2.1-2.3. we treat the measure in the path inte-
gral, and the quantization of liouville theory, following [8, 10]. the extension
to the pair correlation function for slow-moving loops in relative motion is
given in section 2.4. in section 3, we test our ansatz by verifying that we can
recover from our expression for the pair correlation function in the critical
string theory, some known and robust properties of the static heavy quark
potential for wilson lines [2, 12, 15]. we specialize to the case, lilft ,
t >>r, and consider nonrelativistic straight line trajectories, r2=r2+v2 2,
v<<1, as in [17, 24], where  is the zero mode of the euclideanized time
coordinate, x 0. thus, we dene the minkowskian potential:

< m(ci)m(cf ) >= iz 



d ve.(r)

,

(3)

and take the long string limit, t
r. we nd that the pair potential of long
strings in critical string theory has a nonvanishing static remnant at small
separations that takes the scale invariant form:

ve.(r) = 

1
r

(de.  2)

2

,

(4)

where de.=cm+c. the potential is attractive, and can be compared with
the result of [12]. the numerical coecient does not match. notice that
the coecient of the 1/r potential has been extracted directly from a one-
loop string amplitude and is free from any renormalization or regularization

2

scheme dependence. we suppress the leading divergence from the open string
tachyon, and compute directly the potential due to the exchange of massless
open string modes. this is in contrast to the usual calculation of a luscher
term in string theories [14, 29], where the corrections to the tree-level mass
of the lowest lying tachyonic state of the nonsupersymmetric string theory
are obtained by inclusion of quadratic uctuations in the massless modes as
computed in an eective eld theory. the universal behavior in all of these
eld theories is that of de.2 gaussian models [12].
reproducing qualitatively the known behavior of the static heavy quark
potential from critical string theory is an important rst test of wilsons
ansatz. the polyakov model diers in an essential way from the nambu-
goto and eguchi-schild models, in that the world-sheet metric, and its gauge
remnantthe liouville mode, , is treated as an independent dynamical vari-
able on the world-sheet [6, 21, 22, 13, 7]. note that while the loops live in a
p+1 dimensional gauge theory, the worldsheets of cylindrical topology span-
ning the xed boundary curves uctuate in all cm+c eective dimensions of
the string theory. in the critical string theory, there are 24 transversely polar-
ized gluon modes living in the worldvolume of the space-lling d25brane. for
a dpbrane with p<25, p1 of the massless modes are gluonic. the remaining
25p modes contributing to the short distance potential are massless scalars
living in the space orthogonal to the worldvolume of the dpbrane.
our result diers from previous analyses of the static potential in the
polyakov string [7, 13, 16].
it should be noted that the integration over
boundary dieomorphisms in eq. (2) was an essential step in obtaining the
inverse power law behavior in eq. (4). the 1/r term we have found in
the pair potential appears robust for a large class of conformally invariant
string theories based on the polyakov action, including those with world-sheet
fermionic degrees of freedom. in particular, in a fermionic string theory which
is tachyon free, but non-supersymmetric, the 1/r term will be nonvanishing.
this needs further investigation.

2 macroscopic loop correlation function

we now present the derivation of the closed string amplitude linking xed
curves, ci, cf , of length li, lf , in an embedding spacetime with metric
ab=ax bx, and spatial separation r. we begin with the discussion in
[7] of the appropriate boundary conditions on the world-sheet elds. we then

3

adapt this treatment to the conformally invariant framework of the critical
bosonic string as in [8]. for completeness, unlike the treatment in [9, 20],
we include the dynamics of the liouville mode although we will specialize to
the case cm=25, c=1: eectively, 26 free scalars with possible renormalized
bulk, and boundary, cosmological constant terms but vanishing background
charge for the liouville mode. thus, the theory we are considering lies at the
upper edge of the problematic regime 1< cm<25 [10]. for special choices of
the embedding metric on the xed spacetime curves, the liouville dynamics
may entirely decouple and the critical dimension reverts to cm=26.

2.1 boundary reparameterization invariance

the tree correlation function of macroscopic loops is expressed as a path
integral over embeddings and metrics for world-sheets of cylindrical topol-
ogy, terminating on xed spacetime curves ci, cf , in the worldvolume of n
coincident dbranes of length, li, lf :

where the bare action on the right-hand-side is the polyakov term plus any
local, renormalizable, terms necessary to ensure dieomorphism invariance

where  is the string coupling, e=gclosed=g2
open. the factor in square brackets
is the euler characteristic, , a topological invariant whose coecient, the
string coupling, is unrenormalized by world-sheet uctuations. for conve-
nience, we have written the general expression for the surface with b bound-
aries. we will restrict ourselves in this paper to non-intersecting curves
with the following characteristics: each ci
is piecewise smooth with k
straight line intervals, s(i)
 , of equal length, and k turning points, or cor-
ners, (i)
 , =1,   , k. any curvature on the boundaries, if present, is
permitted only at corners. then the euler characteristic takes the form,
 /2, as can be seen from the gauss-bonnet
theorem. the angle terms arise from divergences in the geodesic curvature
at the corners. we will require of the boundary conditions that the bulk

=2  2h  b  pb

i=1pk

=1 (i)

4

curvature rg on the world-sheet is everywhere smooth, which implies that
the world-sheet approaches any corner tangential to the plane of the loop
containing that angle. this requirement is justied further below.

for rectangular, or right-angled, loops, the turning angle, (i)

 =/2,
for every i, . the simplest closed loop with net turning angle 2 is a
rectangular loop with four edges, k=4. the example shown in figure 1
is a pair of coplanar nested rectangular loops, with i=2, k=4. the net
turning angle for both loops vanishes, and there is no contribution to the
euler characteristic of the world-sheet from the corners. thus, =0 in eq.
(5), for ci, cf , coplanar nested rectangular loops with four edges. it should
be noted that, in general, the presence of corners is a violation of boundary
weyl invariance, giving a correction to the liouville action [18]. any pair
of coplanar nested loops with arbitrary numbers of edges having net turning
angle zero gives a weyl invariant loop conguration in the critical spacetime
dimension. in what follows, we will for the most part restrict the discussion
to such congurations. an example is shown in figure 2.

eq. (5) diers from the unconstrained sum over surfaces, familiar from the
prescription for on-shell amplitudes in perturbative string theory, in the for-
mulation of the laplace boundary value problem on the world-sheet. recall
that setting the variation of the classical action to zero gives the boundary
term:

(x m )naaxm|m = 0, m = 0,   , cm .

(7)

we will require boundary reparameterization invariance of the amplitude:
each point on the physical boundary, c, is identied with a point on the
piecewise continuous world-sheet boundary m, but only up to a boundary
reparameterization. this implies the modied dirichlet boundary condition
on embedding functions: x |mtaax |m , =0,   , p, and zero dirichlet
boundary conditions, x m|m =0, m=p + 1,   , cm in directions orthogonal
to the brane volume. we will replace eq. (7) with the equivalent condition:

natbax bx|m = 0,  = 0,   , p .

(8)

the intrinsic world-sheet metric, gab, now satises the same classical equa-
tion of motion as the embedding metric, ab. thus, the physical length, li ,
of the ith spacetime curve, ci, is identied with the parameter length, li,
of the corresponding world-sheet boundary. there is one further condition
arising at the corners, which we stated during our discussion of the euler
characteristic. the world-sheet must always approach a corner tangential to

5

the plane dened by the angle. the reason we derive our boundary condi-
tions from a variational principle is that we are integrating over quantum
uctuations around a classical background lying at an extremum of the ac-
tion. our requirement that the world-sheet approaches corners tangentially
can be justied by noting the behavior of the classical solution. for the
case considered here of two coplanar nested loops, the classical background
is simply a world-sheet lying in the same plane, between the two loops, and
the corner condition is satised. for more complicated situations one must
check the proper corner behavior of the classical background. it appears to
be generally true that such minimal surfaces have the correct smoothness
properties, similar to the properties of soap bubbles coming from wire loops
[19]. in what follows below, we implement dieomorphism invariant bound-
ary conditions satisfying this smoothness condition as constraints on the path
integral quantization of the bosonic string.

we perform the sum over world sheet metrics using an idea taken from
[9]. we begin with the integration over all embeddings, (x m, x ), with xed
ducial bulk metric, and xed ducial einbeins on the parameter boundary.
we choose a ducial metric on the worldsheet, ds2=gabdadb, with e=g.
next we sum over world sheet metric deformations that leave xed the pa-
rameterization of the boundary. finally, we perform an integral over the
boundary data, {e(; l(i)
 )}, summing i=1,    b, =1,   , k, for all bk
intervals, restoring boundary reparameterization invariance. this last sum
is dened as follows (see also the related ideas in [13, 18, 16]).

a boundary state is specied by an einbein and an embedding function,
(e, x). in the application to string amplitudes with nite sized loops, the
embedding function is specied, but we wish to leave its parameterization
unxed. the sum over einbeins implements reparameterization invariance on
the boundary, and we must divide by the volume of the group of boundary
dieomorphisms, di m . thus, we need a reparameterization invariant mea-
sure for the path integration over einbeins. the unique choice is polyakovs
quadratic form for metric deformations [6], restricted to any given boundary
interval. let  be the circle variable parameterizing any boundary circle of
the worldsheet, =t(i)
bein, with g the ducial world-sheet metric. schematically then, a boundary
reparameterization di m acts as:

a a|c i , for any i, and e(i)=g|c i be the ducial ein-

 [x|s(i)

where the  are points in the range 0   < 1, and  varies continuously

 ()] 1   < ,  = 1,   , k,

] = x(i)

 [f (i)



6

with 0=0 identied with k=1. thus, x(i)
 () is the ducial map of the th
interval on the circle into the th interval of the spacetime curve ci, and
f (i)
 () is a dieomorphism of  on the th interval of the circle. schemati-
cally, the path integral has been decomposed:

z [dx][dg]

v ol[di]  z [dei(, e)]

v ol[dim ] z[e]

[dg]

v ol[dim ] z[g;ei ]

[dx]

,

(10)

where v ol[di m ] denotes the volume of the group of dieomorphisms van-
ishing on the boundary, and v ol[di m ] that of the group of boundary dif-
feomorphisms.
in what follows, we will make this gauge xing procedure
explicit.

2.2 gauge fixing the path integral

the gauge xing of world-sheet metrics and the path integration of metrics
and embeddings proceeds as in [8, 10], except that all harmonic functions on
the world-sheet, scalars and vectors, (x, a), are orthogonally decomposed
=+ . the  vanish on the boundary, and the  are harmonic functions
taking values |m =  on the boundary, where the  are specied functions
on the embedded curves ci, cf . consequently, we will allow for uctua-
tions of the world-sheet elds on m, subject only to the constraint that
they preserve the normal direction to the brane, the xed embedding of the
spacetime curves, and the smoothness condition at any corners of the bound-
ary, if present. we will assume the reader is familiar with references [8, 10]
and simply assemble the dierent contributions to the path integral.

begin with the integration over embedding functions with xed ducial
world sheet metric. we choose nested coplanar rectangular loops of spacetime
perimeter length, li, lf , and xed spacetime separation, r, as shown in fig.
1. for each of cm scalar degrees of freedom, normalizing the path integration
over harmonic functions vanishing on the boundary as in [8, 20] gives the
result:

er2l/2

(det0)cm/2 = er2l/2

[(il)]cm ,

(11)

where the determinant of the laplacian on scalars is computed with the
zero dirichlet boundary condition, and l is the cylinder modulus dened by
the ducial metric, ds2=l2(d1)2+(d2)2, 011, 0 2  1. with this
choice, the area of the world-sheet is normalized to l. there is no integration

7

over embedding functions on the boundary since we consider the amplitude
between xed spacetime curves.

next consider the integration over metric deformations vanishing on the
boundary. as in [6, 7, 8, 20], we isolate the dependence on symmetric trace-
less variations of the metric and divide out by the volume of the gauge group
[dim ]0, dieomorphisms of the world-sheet continuously connected to the
identity and vanishing on the boundary. normalize the path integrations on
the cylinder as in [8, 20]:

1  z [dg]e|g|2/2 = jm (, g)z [d]egz [d]

gz 

0

dle|g|2/2

,

(12)

where |g|2 is the polyakov quadratic form for metric deformations, and
jm (, g) is the jacobian from the change of variables to deformations of,
respectively, the liouville mode, , dieomorphisms, a, vanishing on the
boundary, and the cylinder modulus, l, computed in [8]. taking into account
the contributions of the conformal killing vector and zero modes of the lapla-
cian on vectors, 1, the innity from the integration over dieomorphisms
[d]
g vanishing on the boundary is cancelled against the volume of the gauge
group [di m ]0. the result is an integral over the cylinder modulus times the
quantum functional integral for liouville eld theory:

jm (, g)z [d]eg esl[,g]+sboundary[,e]

,

(13)

where sboundary includes any boundary contributions to the action, including
possible corners. sl[, g] is the unrenormalized liouville action [6]:

(14)

with integration norm given by:

||2 = z d2qge()2

.

(15)

we will treat the quantization of the liouville eld following [10]. note that
the quantum functional integral in eq. (13) denotes all possible bulk and
boundary deformations of the liouville eld. in particular, it receives cor-
rections from the measure for dieomorphisms on the boundary as is shown
below.

8

we now perform the sum over metric deformations nonvanishing on the
boundary, orthogonal to the modes summed in eq. (12). the metric on the
world-sheet is gabe, and the ducial einbein induced on the boundary is
e=g. note that a rescaling of the einbein can be absorbed in a shift in the
liouville eld. consider the ith boundary circle with parameter =t(i)
a a,
in the cylinder metric dened above, the length of either
and length, li.
0 de, equals l. a variation of the einbein on the th interval is
 (), and a possible shift, , in the

boundary, r 1
the result of a dieomorphism, f (i)
liouville eld. thus,

where l(i)
is the length of the th interval of the ith boundary circle, and

 is a rescaling of the einbein which can always be absorbed in a shift of
the liouville eld on the boundary. the restriction of the quadratic form for
metric deformations to the boundary, m, gives a measure on the tangent
space to the space of einbeins on any given interval (i,  labels are suppressed
for clarity):

|e|2 = z d(e(; l))1(e(; l))2 = z d[e()(f )

where the jacobian jm is obtained as before, from a change of variables
to deformations of, respectively, boundary dieomorphisms, f , and einbein
rescalings, . since a rescaling of the einbein is absorbed by a shift of the

2note that the conformal class of the metric determines the length of any boundary
circle, a modulus of the surface. thus, rescalings of the ducial einbein must be absorbed
in a shift of the liouville eld on the boundary in order that the conformal class of the
metric is left unchanged.

liouville eld we can, with no loss of generality, set =0. consequently, the
integration over [d] can be consistently dropped from the path integral.
the innity from the integration over dieomorphisms will be cancelled by
the volume of the gauge group of dieomorphisms on the boundary, dim ,
which has no disconnected part (no modulus). combining this analysis of
boundary deformations with the bulk deformations in eq. ( 12), we can write:

(a/2)nm/2(detabab)1/2(det1)1/2

(19)
the factor in square brackets is the jacobian, jm , derived in [8]. a is the
world-sheet area, and the term in the denominator arises from conformal
killing vectors, if present. on the cylinder, nm=1, the world-sheet area,
a=l, in the metric dened above, and we have a single conformal killing
vector. thus,

jm =

(l/2)1/2  l1(il)

(l/2)1/2

[det((taa)2 + 1)]1/2

.

(20)

the  dependence is absorbed in the liouville action.

let us explain the second term in eq. (19), the boundary jacobian, jm ,
in more detail. for any loop, i=1,   , b, jm arises from the product of indi-
vidual determinants for each interval, si
, =1,   , k. in the nite-sized loop
amplitude application, dieomorphisms act on the circle as a whole, identi-
cally on each of k intervals. however, dieomorphisms on any one boundary
are independent of the others and, consequently, the result is a product of b
independent determinants. here, b=2, and the worldsheet boundaries have
a common parameter length, l. thus on the cylinder,

jm = det[

1
l2

d2
d2 ] = l

.

(21)

a similar path integration arises in the problem of obtaining the o-shell
propagator for a relativistic point particle, a discussion of which appears in
reference [9]. see, also, the ansatz for a scalar quark loop given in [13].

assembling eqs. (11), (13), (14), and (19), our result for the pair cor-
relation function of piecewise smooth macroscopic loops, ci, cf , at xed
separation, r, is:

< m(ci)m(cf ) >= z 

0

dler2l/2

[(il)]1cm/2z [d]ge es[;g],

(22)

10

where s[; g]=sl[; g]+sboundary is the action for the liouville eld with
boundary contributions. in writing eq. (22), we have suppressed the classi-
cal contribution from the embedding of the loops, ssaddle[li, lf ], which deter-
mines the saddle point of the path integral. for coplanar nested rectangular
loops, this is simply the area, lr, for lilf =l>>r.

2.3 quantizing the liouville eld

we now treat the quantization of the liouville eld following [10]. we re-
quire that the loop amplitude preserve quantum conformal invariance. we
begin by suppressing quantum uctuations and restrict to the zero mode,
0, noting that the classical equation of motion is that of a free scalar eld
in the regime 0: the exponential potential is suppressed. we will
preserve this asymptotic property in dening the quantum theory: the wave-
functions/operators of liouville conformal eld theory are required to match
smoothly to free eld states in the 0 regime, characterized by mo-
mentum and occupation number alone.
quantum liouville conformal eld theory can be dened by a functional
integral over a renormalized liouville eld, r, with conformally invariant
free eld norm:

|r|2 = z d2qg(r)2

.

(23)

the ansatz of [10] is that the eects of renormalization can be lumped in the
potential, leaving a kinetic term for r with the canonical normalization of
a free scalar eld theory. thus, we write:

z [d]eg esl[,g]+sboundary[,e] = z [d]

gz 



d0 es[r,g]

,

(24)

where, s[r], includes all possible renormalizable terms in the bulk, and on
the boundary, that preserve both dieomorphism and weyl invariance. note
that a corner anomaly is a spontaneous breaking of weyl invariance on the
boundary, contributing an additional term not included in s[r, g]. as an
aside, we note that at weak string coupling a corner anomaly only impacts
the dynamics of the zero mode, 0.
it would be interesting to clarify the
role of the corner contribution in the dynamics of the liouville mode more
generally. see the related analysis in the semi-classical quantizations of the
liouville eld discussed in [13, 18, 16].

11

in a weyl invariant theory, the renormalized action s[r, g] takes the

general form:

s[r, g] =

1

8 zm
d2qg[ 1
r zci
(i)
xi=1


b

2 gabarbr + q rr]  rzm
dee(i)r

,

d2qger

(25)

where q, , and (i), are constants determined by the requirement [10] that
every term in eq. (25) be a dimension one primary eld, in a conformal eld
theory of vanishing total central charge: cm+c=0. the renormalized bulk
and boundary cosmological constants, r, (i)
r are arbitrary marginal cou-
plings in the conformal eld theory. with no loss of generality, we could set
the boundary cosmological constant term on the cylinder to zero, retaining
r.

the only mode of r that survives on the boundary is 0, and the modes
r satisfy dirichlet boundary conditions as in [7, 8, 9, 20]. then, conformal


invariance requires:

q = s cm  25

3

,  = (cm  1  cm  25)/23

,

(26)

the upper sign matching the dimension of the cosmological constant opera-
tor as computed in a semi-classical cm saddle point evaluation of the
path integral for the liouville eld  [13, 10]. for the at space string am-
plitude application, we can choose cm=25, cr=1, such that the background
charge, q, vanishes. choosing =2, the hilbert space is found to have
renormalizable operators of the form, eqr, for re(q)0. the bulk theory
on the world-sheet is that of 26 free scalar elds, with r, r, undetermined
marginal couplings.

thus, for weyl invariant coplanar right-angled loop congurations, the
liouville mode entirely decouples in the critical spacetime dimension. note
that the expression in eq. (22) holds for arbitrary loop lengths, li, lf , and
loop separation, r.
it is interesting to compare with the propagator for
punctual, or point-like, boundary states computed in [9]. there the world
sheet boundaries were mapped to spacetime points and strictly speaking
there is no longer a well-dened saddle point action for the path integral. in
the next section, we will consider the opposite limit, li, lf >> r, extracting
the wilson line potential for small loop separations [7, 11].

2.4 macroscopic loops in relative motion

following [17, 23], it is an easy extension to compute the pair correlation
function for loops in relative motion. consider a pair of coplanar nested
rectangular loops with the plane of the loops aligned parallel to the (x 0, x p)
plane. let us rotate one of the loops relative to the other through an angle 
in the (x 0,x 25) plane. the loops are equivalently interpreted as the world-
lines of scalar quarks with large, but nite, euclidean propagation time, li
 lf  t , at xed spatial separation r, and with relative slow velocity v
in a direction, x p1, orthogonal to the plane of the loop. the parameter
v=tanh(i).

the necessary changes to the static pair correlation function computed
above are obtained as follows.
it is convenient to complexify the pair of
coordinates (x 0, x p1), which satisfy boundary conditions, x p1|ci=0, and
x 0|citaax 0, and the condition, x p1|cf =vx 0, at the other endpoint.
parameterize the world sheet with open string endpoints 2=0,1 at bound-
aries, ci, cf , respectively, and an open string loop parameterized, 011.
1 is identical with the ducial circle variable  dened above. a complete
set of eigenfunctions of the scalar laplacian is composed from the basis:

(n1,n2) = e2n1i1
()

sin([n2 + ]2)

,

(27)

where  takes value: iu/, or 1+iu/. the velocity has been parameter-
ized as v=tanhu. the remaining 22 embedding coordinates satisfy the zero
dirichlet boundary condition as above. the functional determinant of 0
takes the form:

det()

0 = yn1,n2

42[n2

1 + l2(n2 + )2]

,

(28)

where l is the inverse cylinder modulus dened above, and n1,
n20. this is computed using zeta function regularization as in [8]:

ln det =  lim

s0

d

ds xn1,n2

[42(n2

1 + l2(n2 + )2)]s

,

(29)

strictly speaking, since we will extract the u0 limit from the result, we
should introduce a regulator mass, m, for the n1=n2=0 zero mode, as in
[8, 20]. this is left implicit in eq. (29). the innite sum over n1 is expressed

13

as a contour integral by a sommerfeld-watson transform. the contour c
runs counterclockwise from +i to +i. the result is:

(42)sic

dz

2i xn20

[z2 + l2(n2 + )2]scot(z)

.

(30)

the integrand has poles along the real axis. writing the cotangent as
icot(z)=2/(1  e2iz)  1, we can extract the contribution from the
integral that is nite in the limit s0:

2 xn20

ln|1  e2l(n2+)|

,

(31)

plus terms of order ln|4m|+o(m 2) when =0. the term singular in the
limit s0 can be identied as the vacuum energy:

2e0

combining eqs. (31), (32), gives:

which can be written as the ratio of jacobi theta functions. setting u=0 and
suppressing the n2 = 0 term in the result recovers the cylinder determinant
for a pair of scalars with dirichlet boundary condition: [(il)]2.

substituting in eq. (22), we obtain an analogous result for the pair cor-

3 eective theory of long strings

consider eq. (34) in the limit of large loop perimeter length, lilft ,
and small loop separation, r. more precisely, we consider maps from the
parameter boundary, m, to spacetime curves that are parallel straight lines
of length t , with constant separation, r, taking the limit t >>r. then the
saddle point in eq. (22) gives the perimeter of the loop rather than the area.
we will verify that we obtain a 1/r term in the potential for long straight
strings in this regime.

begin by reviewing some expectations from gauge theory. consider a rect-
angular wilson loop rt , with edges of length r, t . consider the limit
t 
r, with r held xed. the long legs of the rectangle are interpreted as
the proper time world-lines of a quark and antiquark. then the loop expec-
tation value takes the form a(t )ev (r)t , and v (r) is interpreted as the
static quark-antiquark potential at xed spatial separation r. a(t ) is some
function with slower fall-o than an exponential. generic considerations of
a nonabelian gauge theory that connes, lead us to expect a crossover in the
functional form of the heavy quark potential, v (r), from coulomb behavior
in the high-energy short distance regime:

to a linear plus inverse power law behavior in the low-energy conning regime:

v (r) = c/r

,

(35)

v (r) = r +  + /r + o(1/(r)2)

.

(36)

 and  are known to be nonuniversal constants. of greater interest is the
universal constant, , rst estimated analytically by luscher et al in [4]:
=(d  2)/24 in a d dimensional eld theory model for the quantum dy-
namics. an intuitive derivation of the universal constant is as follows [12]:
d is the number of degrees of freedom in a gaussian eective eld theory
that describes the lowest energy uctuations of the ux tube linking quark
and antiquark. in d  1 spatial dimensions there are d  2 collective coor-
dinates, x 
i , i=1, 2, describing the transverse uctuations of the ux tube.
quantization gives the gaussian model in d 2 dimensions: the 1/24 is the
contribution to the casimir energy from an innite sum of harmonic oscilla-
tors in their ground state, with an independent sum for each bosonic degree
of freedom. irrelevant couplings to higher dimensional operators can induce
interactions and also determine the nonuniversal constants, , , but the

15

eective eld theory for the lowest energy uctuations is universal. it should
be noted that, in a scale invariant theory, v (r) would take the form a/r,
with a a constant, independent of the spacetime dimensionality of the gauge
theory [11]. evidence that conformally invariant critical string theory can
describe the eective theory of a nielsen-olesen vortex was previously given
in [15]. we now return to the calculation of the eective potential in the
polyakov string theory.

3.1 eective potential for long straight strings

let us begin with the eective loop potential at small separations. suppress-
ing the bosonic string tachyon, at small r, the integral over l is dominated
by the exchange of massless states in the open string spectrum, equivalently,
long, and massive, closed string states. as in [17], we consider nonrelativistic
trajectories, r( )2=r2+v2 2, where  is the zero mode of x 0, and express the
amplitude as an integral over proper time  =itm , where tm is minkowskian
time. dening the potential:

<    >= iz t /2

t /2

d ve.(r)

,

(37)

and taking the limit t, as in [17, 24], we obtain:
ve.(r, v) = 2(82)1/2z 

dler2l/2

l1/2(il)21 tanh(u)eu2l/
 , il)

11( ul

0

.

(38)

consider the amplitude at small loop separations. expanding in powers of
e2l, as in the calculation of the eective potential for moving dbranes
[17, 24], gives:

ve.(r, v) =

dler2l/2

l1/2 tanh(u)eu2l/

(82)1/2z 

0

sin(ul)
[e2l + (22 + 2cos(2ul)) + o(e2l)]

.

(39)

we now assume nonrelativistic velocities, tanh(u)u, sin(ul)ul. suppress-
ing the leading tachyon divergence, we nd that the subleading term due
to exchange of massless modes in the open string spectrum gives a remnant
static potential at u=0:

ve.(r) = 24  (82)1/2  [

1
r

(2)1/2(

1
2

)]

,

(40)

16

where the factor in square brackets is the result of the integration over the
cylinder modulus l. setting 24=de.2, our result for the static potential is:
(41)

,

ve.(r) = 

(de.  2) 

1
r

1
2

with de.=cm+cr. note that terms comparable to the nonuniversal terms
,  present in luschers eective eld theory analysis will be contributed
by the saddle point action of the critical string path integral.

3.2 point-like loops and d-instantons

let us begin by verifying the coulomb potential for point-like loops at large
spatial separation. formally, the cylinder boundaries are mapped to points
in space with xed spatial separation r. these have been called punctual
boundary states in [9]. strictly speaking, the path integral does not have
a well-dened saddle about which to compute quantum uctuations in this
limit. the integral over boundary reparameterizations is also superuous
and can be dropped as in [9]. for large separations, r, the integrand
can be expanded in powers of e2/l. the result is an expression of the form:

vpoint(r, v) =

dl
l

0

(82)1/2z 

tanh(u)
2isin(iu)
[e2l + (22 + 2cosh(2u)) + o(e2/l)]

er2l/2

l23/2

,

(42)

from which we surmise the static potential:

vpoint(r) = (82)1/2  24  [

1
r23 (2)23/2(

23
2

)]

.

(43)

this has the characteristic 1/r23 fall-o due to graviton-dilaton exchange
in d=26 dimensions [24].
it is natural to interpret the r limit of the pair correlation func-
tion of point-like loops computed in [9] as the potential for a pair of d-
instantons [24]: spatially separated events in spacetime at constant  =0.
the d-instanton potential is dened by simply eliminating the now redun-
dant integral over  in eq. (37). for simplicity, consider the case n=1. this
gives the minkowskian potential:

vdinst.(r)  z 

0

dl
l

er2l/2

(il)24

.

(44)

17

substituting (il)=l1/2(i/l), expand the integrand for large separations in
powers of e2/l and extract the potential due to the exchange of massless
closed string modes. this gives:

vdinst.(r) = 24[

1
r24 (2)12(

24
2

)]

,

(45)

with the expected 1/r24 fall-o for d-instantons in d=26.

4 conclusions

the crossover from a coulombic potential for point-like loops at large sep-
arations to an attractive 1/r potential for nite-sized loops at small sepa-
rations, described by massless open string exchange, occurs at distances of

order, rcrito(v). this crossover behavior is generic both in the bosonic

and fermionic string theories [17, 24, 26]. it is also indicative of the univer-
sal occurrence of a 1/r term in the long string potential at short distances,
in any critical string theory without spacetime supersymmetry. recall the
result from [9], where the cylinder was shown to factorize on intermediate
states with poles in the propagator corresponding to both on-shell closed
string physical states, plus additional poles attributed to steuckelberg elds
necessary to maintain o-shell reparameterization invariance (see the related
analysis in [25]). it would be interesting to understand the decoupling of un-
physical ghostly states associated with boundary reparameterization invari-
ance from the viewpoint of the modern interpretation of the pair correlation
function of point-like loops as the d-instanton potential.

it would be unfortunate if the results described above worked exclusively
for the example of coplanar nested rectangular loops in at spacetime ex-
plored in this paper. we will now argue that this is not the case, and that
the 1/r term is universally obtained from the pair correlation function of
loops in a generic curved spacetime background of string/m theory. from
eq. (40), it is clear that the coecient of the 1/r potential is determined
by the number of eective dimensions of the string theory. the nonuniver-
sal information contained in the detailed form of the saddle point action is
determined by the geometry of the embedding and is therefore background
dependent. however the saddle point action must reduce to a perimeter law
in the long string limit. it is interesting to understand the minimal surfaces
that describe saddle congurations for the string path integral, for arbitrary

18

loops, and in general curved spacetime backgrounds: this subject has been
the focus of the recent spate of work on wilson loops in supersymmetric
string theories in ads spacetimes [27, 28, 29].

the world-sheet embedding corresponding to the saddle point, for a given
conguration of loops, and in a specic background geometry, must obey the
rg is required to vary smoothly
boundary conditions listed in section 2.
on the worldsheet with ducial metric, ds2=gabdadb. the ducial metric
species a gauge slice in the space of metrics. this choice is determined by
the saddle point conguration that dominates the string path integral. thus,

gab|m = ab|m ,

ab = g(x)ax bx 

,

(46)

where ab is the embedding metric in the worldvolume of the dbrane. a
constant curvature ducial metric is a convenient choice in at spacetime.
in the generic curved spacetime geometry, the ducial metric on the world-
sheet is required to agree with the embedding metric on the boundary of
the loops. the saddle point conguration is also subject to the smoothness
condition at corners, if present: the inward pointing normal to the boundary
on the worldsheet is required to lie in the plane of the angle at a right-
angled corner. a full quantum treatment of the pair correlation function for
wilson loops requires that we are able to solve the dirichlet boundary value
problem for scalar and vector laplacians on this ducial surface. a normal
coordinate expansion of the polyakov action for the sigma model may allow a
solution of this problem in an o() expansion. our claim is that the leading
contribution from such a calculation will universally give a 1/r term for a
large class of sigma models that are solutions to the beta function equations
of string theory. this would be interesting to investigate further.
