abstract

a manifestly lorentz invariant eective action for yang-mills theory de-
pending only on commuting elds is constructed. this action posesses a bosonic
symmetry, which plays a role analogous to the brst symmetry in the standard
formalism.

1 introduction

a peculiar feathure of non-abelian gauge theories is the appearance of anticommu-
ting scalar elds (faddeev-popov ghosts) in a lorentz covariant local eective action [1].
it is
beleived to be an unavoidable price to be paid for the construction of a manifestly lorentz invariant
local eective action.

locality of the eective action is the essential ingredient of the proof of unitarity in the lorentz
covariant quantization scheme for nonabelian gauge elds (brst quantization) [2]. however in
this approach there is one problem which, to my knowleadge, has never been seriously discussed. it
is known that fermi-dirac quantization of scalar elds contradicts local commutativity. therefore
it is by no means evident that a theory including anticommuting scalar elds respects a causality
condition. of course it is not a serious problem for the yang-mills theory, as in this case one can
prove the equivalence of the formulation based on the lorentz invariant action and the coulomb
gauge formulation, in which causality and unitarity is manifest. however, if one applies brst
quantization to more complicated models, where a true hamiltonian formulation is not at hand,
this problem deserves special investigation. for this reason it would be desirable to have a lorentz
covariant formulation which does not involve anticommuting scalar elds.

in this paper we shall show that using a bosonization procedure proposed by us earlier [3],
[4] one can construct an alternative eective action which includes only commuting elds. this
action describes a ve dimensional constrained system, which in the physical sector is equivalent to
the usual yang-mills theory. our bosonic eective action posesses a symmetry which plays a role
similar to the brst symmetry [5] in the usual approach.in particular this symmetry generates the
relations between the green functions which are equivalent to generalized ward identities [6], [7].

the gauge elds a(x) and the lagrange multiplier  depend on four dimensional coordinates x,
whereas the scalar elds c(x, t),
c(x, t) depend also on extra variable t, which acquires values in
the interval l  t  l. the elds a and  are hermitean, whereas c and c are conjugate to
each other. all the elds are commuting.
we claim that in the limit l   the yang-mills eld green functions generated by the
eective action (1) coincide with the corresponding green functions in the standard faddeev-
popov formalism. more precisely

where det m is the usual faddeev-popov determinant. the integration in the eq.(4) goes over the
elds c(x, t),

c(x, t) satisfying the following boundary conditions

c(x, l) = b(x),

c(x, l) = b+(x)

(5)

it may depend
where b(x) is an arbitrary, but xed function, bounded in the limit l  .
on other elds, but the simplest choice is b = 0. the boundary conditions in fourdimensional
coordinates x are the usual ones (see [8])

to prove the equation (4) we calculate the integral over c, c explicitely. first of all we note that

the operator m +m is hermitean and we can introduce a complete system of its eigenfunctions

in this basis the integral over c, c may be written in the form

m +m  = m

the integral over c, c is saturated by the stationary values of c, c, dened by the classical equations:

the solution of these equations is

c =

substituting these solutions into the integral (9) and integrating over t one gets

where we used the fact that det m = det m +. it completes the proof of the eq. (4).

3 symmetry of the classical action

in the previous section we proved that in the limit l   the green functions generated by the
eective action (1) coincide with the usual yang-mills green func-
tions in covariant -gauges. therefore they satisfy generalized ward identities [6], [8]. so one
expects that our eective action posesses some symmetry which plays a role of brst symmetry
in the usual formalism. below we shall show that such a symmetry indeed exists. it is interesting
to note that although our construction reproduces the usual yang-mills theory only in the limit
l  , the symmetry exists even for a nite l. in the limit l   the symmetry transformations
simplify considerably.
the symmetry of the action (1) can be found by trial and error method. firstly one notes
that transformation of the gauge eld a must leave invariant the yang-mills lagrangian. so it is
natural to start with the special gauge transformation of the elds a, c, c:

 = (d)a
aa
1ca = tabdcbd
1ca = tabdcbd

(14)

here  is a constant innitesimal parameter. we note that although transformations (14) are
special gauge transformations, they of course represent a global symmetry.

the transformations (14) change the gauge xing term and quadratic form for the elds c, c

1s = z d4xa(x)z l
 (x)) z d4xaz l

l

l

= z d4x(af a

dtf a

(x, t) =

dtf(x, t)

(15)

here the rst term at the r.h.s. is a total divergency and the second term may be compensated by
the approptiate variation of elds c, c:

2ca = 2ca =

the explicit form of the function f is

l

dtf(x, t)

f a
 = 1(d( a)a +
+tabd[(dc)b(d c)a + h.c.]

(16)

(17)

the transformation (16) compensates the variation 1s, but changes the quadratic form for the
elds c, c:

2s =

l

dt

ca

(18)

in this equation the rst term is a total derivative over t and the second term is proportional to

z l

l

dt(ca(x, t) + ca(x, t))

(19)

and vanishes at the constraint surface. to provide a manifest invariance of the action one can
eliminate the variation (18) by the following change of lagrange multiplier :

a = 

i
2

m m +2ca + h.c

(20)

combining the equations (14, 16, 20) we get the complete symmetry transformation of the bosonic
eective action (1). these transformations change the eective lagrangian by a total derivative
and via neuther theorem lead to the existence of a ve-dimensional conserved current

however for physical applications we are interested in the existence of a conserved charge

tjt + j = 0

q = z l

l

dtz d3xj0

(21)

(22)

integrating the conservation law ( 21) over dt and d3x we see that the integral of iji vanishes by
the usual reasonings due to fast decreasing of elds at spatial innity. the integral of tjt gives

where

dttjt = jt(l)  jt(l)

jt =

(23)

(24)

the conservation law (21) is fullled due to the classical equations of motion. these equations
look as follows

i

+ m +m c +  = 0

+ m +m c +  = 0

c

c(l) = b,

c(l) = b+

(25)

it is easy to see that solutions of these equations satisfy the relation

due to this property the r.h.s. of eq.(23) is zero and

c(l) = c(l)

0z l

l

dtz d3xj0(x, t) = 0

(26)

(27)

for a nite l the symmetry transformations are rather complicated. in particular they are
nonlocal in extra variable t. however for physical applications we are interested in the limiting
case l  . one can show that in this limit all nonlocal terms give vanishing contributions to
relevant quantities and one can use the asymptotic symmetry transformations

(28)

the asymptotic symmetry (28) do not leave the action invariant, but transforms it to another
action sl  sl, which in the limit l   leads to the same physical conclusions. in the next
section we shall show how using he asymptotic symmetry (28) one can derive generalized ward
identities.

4 generalized ward identities.

to derive generalized ward identities we consider the following generating functional

z(j, ) = lim

lz exp{is +z d4x[j a

(x)aa

(x) + a(x)a(x)]}dadcdcd

(29)

let us make in this integral the change of variables, which is the asymptotic symmetry transfor-
mation (28). as the change of variables does not change the integral, we can put

which is, as we shall see, the equation, generating generalized ward identities. taking into account
that the jacobian of this transformation is trivial, we get in this way

dz
d

= 0

(30)

lz exp{is +z d4x[j a

lim

 (x)aa

(x) + a(x)a(x)]}{z d4x[j a

 (x)(d(x))a +
+(2al)1a(x)(m m +m )a)a(x)] + o}dcdcdda = 0

(31)

the term o = o(1/l) arises from noninvariance of the quadratic form of the elds c, c under
asymptotic symmetry transformations (28). using the eq.(16) one can see that the variation of
the action is quadratic in c, c and proportional to l1. these terms have to be compared with the
quadratic form in the action (1) which is of order o(1). it is easy to verify that these new terms
produce the corrections vanishing in the limit l  .

performing the integration over c, c in the eq.(31), we get

lz exp{iz d4x[1/4f a

lim

aa

f a

  1/(2)(a)2 + j a

+(2l)1a(y)[(m m +m )a]a(y)}dad = 0

ab b]}z d4y{j a

a2l(m m +)1

(32)

dierentiating this equation with respect to  and putting  = 0 we arrive to the identity

lz exp{i[sy m +z d4x(j a

lim

(y)(d(y))ab(z) + (2l)1(cid:2)(m m +m )(a)(cid:3)b

ab b)]} 
(z)(cid:21) dad = 0

(33)

finally, performing integration over  and applying the operator (m m +m )1 we get the standard
generalized ward identity in the form [6], [8].

5 discussion

we showed above that a purely bosonic lorentz covariant formulation of non-abelian gauge theo-
ries is possible provided one introduces the depenence of auxilliary elds on extra variable. due to
locality of the eective action and abcense of anticommuting integer spin elds, no problem with
causality arises in this approach. of course a complete formulation must also include the discussion
of regularization and renormalization procedure. it can be done but will not be discussed here.
an interesting feathure of our construction is the existence of the symmetry, which replaces in our
approach brst symmetry. it is important to note that this symmetry exists even for nite values
of l and therefore may be used for the construction of a lorentz covariant quantization procedure
alternative to brst quantization. there are several interesting problems which remain open in
this approach. at present it is not clear what is a geometrical meaning of the new symmetry. it
would be interesting to try to generalize this construction to supersymmetric theories.
