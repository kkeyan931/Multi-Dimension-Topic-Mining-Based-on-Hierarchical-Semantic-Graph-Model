abstract

the computation of mode sums of the types encountered in basic quantum

eld theoretic applications is addressed with an emphasis on their expansions

into functions of distance that can be interpreted as potentials. we show

how to regularize and calculate the casimir energy for the continuum nambu-

goto string with massive ends as well as for the discrete non-relativistic string

with massive ends. as an additional example, we examine the eect on the

interquark potential of the kalb-ramond eld interacting with a qcd string.

i. introduction

the determination of the casimir energy or zero-point energy for a quantum system
through the evaluation of the mode sum is a problem of quite practical importance. these
sums are almost always divergent and need regularization in order to be interpreted sensibly.
the interpretation of the result as a background energy or potential is made most evident
if the sum can be expressed in terms of simple functions of distance, that can be put into
one to one correspondence with simple potential terms such as coulombic or centripetal
potential components. the purpose of this paper is to illustrate how this can be done for
several classes of mode sums encountered recently in the literature.

ii. continuum qcd string with massive ends

we begin by examining the computation of the casimir energy for a static string with

massive ends that is allowed to vibrate transversely.

the eigenfrequencies for a vibrating nambu-goto string of length r and tension a, ter-
minated by two massive quarks of mass m that are allowed to move only transversely has
been given by lambiase and nesterenko [1] as the roots of the transcendental equation

f () = (m 22  a2) sin r  2ma cos r = 0.

(1)

the casimir energy, which is half the sum of these eigenfrequencies, can be calculated with
aid of the watson-sommerfeld transform

ecasimir =

n =

4i ic

 d

d
d

ln f () ,

(2)

where the contour c encloses the roots of f (), all of which lie on the positive real axis
for physically meaningful frequencies. the energy computed in eq. (2) is the energy per
transverse degree of freedom. in d dimensions, there would be an extra factor of d 2. the
sum in eq. (2) is formally innite and must be regularized and renormalized. we deform
the contour to include the entire left half-plane and keep only the regular portion

as an excellent approximation for s small. using the results of section iii below, we nd

i(s) = 

2
12

+ 22s + (4 + 2 ln 8)s + 2s ln s +    ,

(15)

which agrees extremely well with numerical evaluations of the integral for small s, as can
be seen in fig. 1. if more accuracy is needed for larger values of s, higher terms in s in the
exponent of eq. (10) can be retained and those contributions to the exponent expanded in
a power series.

if the quark mass m is large, we can use the approximation eq. (15), to calculate the
m to the casimir energy. from the denition eq. (9), we nd

lowest order corrections in 1

using zeta functions quickly becomes problematic due to the fact that no matter how small
x is, for suciently large n values, n x   and small x expansions of k1(x) cannot be
used. however, we can use another integral representation of the bessel function,

iv. qcd string interacting with monopole current

the physics of charged particles moving in a plane under the inuence of a constant
magnetic eld is a very beautiful and enlightening subject containing such surprises as the
quantum hall eect. the string analog of a charge moving in a constant magnetic eld is
the motion of a string in a constant kalb-ramond [2] eld strength

h0ij(x) = 0 ,
hijk(x) = hijk .

(30)

this system is a model of a qcd string interacting with a constant monopole density and,
like the landau problem, is also exactly solvable [3]. (the monopole current is proportional
to the dual of h: j 
monopole  h.) the kalb-ramond potential b corresponding
to the eld strength (30) is

b0i(x) = 0 ,
h
3

bij(x) =

ijkxk.

(31)

in vortex mechanics, the kalb-ramond eld describes the magnus forces on a vortex line
moving in a uid.

the rst-quantized action for a bosonic string moving in a background kalb-ramond

eld is

s = 

a

2 z d d (cid:16)h habax bx  + b(x)abax bx (cid:17) .

(32)

if we substitute the eld bij above into the string action, and we choose orthonormal

coordinates on the worldsheet, we nd the action becomes

s = 

a

2 z d d  abax bx  +

h
3

ijkabx iax jbx k! ,

and implies the equations of motion

x 0  x 0 = 0 ,
x  x = h x  x .

4

(33)

(34)
(35)

here we have used reparametrization invariance of the action to set coordinate time equal
to laboratory time  = x0 and to set the spatial parameter of the string equal to the distance
in real space along the string,  = z. we wish to nd the casimir energy of a long straight
string acting under the inuence of this external kalb-ramond eld. we assume the string
lies along the z direction and has length r. thus we nd that x = z, and the linearized
equations of motion for the small vibrations on the string become

x  x = h y ,
y  y  = h x .

(36)

we dene the right and left circularly polarized modes x  x  iy , and nd that in terms
of them the small amplitude vibration equations above reduce to

x  x = ih x.

(37)

since our string has xed length, we know that the wavelength with either xed dirichlet
or neumann boundary conditions (innitely massive or completely massless quarks at the
end) lead to

r (cid:19)2
x  ih x = x = (cid:18)n

x , n = 1, 2, 3, . . . .

or, if we assume that x = eitx0,

2

r (cid:19)2
  h = (cid:18)n

= k2
n.

the frequencies of small vibrations are then

n  =

(38)

(42)

appear in a large variety of problems (see the references following eq. (5.33) in [1]). we
now show the simple steps with which this sum can be expressed in a form very similar to
eq. (14).
first we must subtract out the divergence from the sum in order to regularize it

v. discrete isgur-paton string

in this section we consider the interquark potential of a static quark-antiquark pair bound
by a ux tube, considered by isgur and paton [4] and merlin and paton [5] to be a discrete
string consisting of n masses m a distance d apart. this string, when terminated by particles
of mass m, has equations of motion [4,5,6] with the secular equation

. the innite mass m limit results
in

p = 1, 2, . . . , n.

assuming nite m corrections of the form

this expression agrees very well with the actual sum, plotted as a function of n. this is
illustrated in fig. 2.

for large quark masses m, we can again calculate the lowest order 1

m corrections to the
casimir energy, this time for the discrete string before the limit of link spacing going to zero
(d  0) is taken. to make contact with isgur and paton [4], we take  = 1
d2 and then use
n = ( r
d)  1 to arrive at the casimir energy contribution per transverse degree of freedom

ecasimir =

2r

24r

2m

+ o(

m 2 ) .

(75)

we note that although the universal luscher term  
m corrections are completely dierent.

24r is present in both (16) and (75),
in the former case, the correction is o( 1m
),

the 1

9

while in the latter it is o( 1
m ). of course, there is no reason to expect that the form of the
casimir energies will be the same for the nambu-goto string and the discrete string of isgur
and paton. the former is relativistic while the later is not. in addition, it is not likely that
the casimir energy of a discrete string will go the the continuum result as the number of
mass points is taken to innity. sums and limits generally depend upon the order in which
they are done, especially when the sums are divergent and must be regularized.

vi. conclusions

we have shown how to regularize and perform the zero-point energy mode sums for
the discrete non-relativistic string studied by isgur and paton and the relativistic continuum
nambu-goto string. computation of these divergent sums is necessary in order to obtain the
casimir energy of the system to be interpreted as part of the static potential for quarks bound
by a qcd string. we have shown that the lowest order corrections to the casimir energies
in the reciprocal of the mass of the terminating quark is dierent for the two cases. we
have also shown how the addition of a background kalb-ramond eld with a corresponding
constant eld strength aects the static potential. we hope to extend these results to the
case of a string interacting with itself through a kalb-ramond eld.
