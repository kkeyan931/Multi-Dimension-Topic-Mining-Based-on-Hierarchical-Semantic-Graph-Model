abstract

in this work we study how the infrared sector of the interaction
hamiltonian can aect the construction of the s matrix operator of
qed in (2+1) dimensions.

1

introduction

the issue of infrared divergences in quantum electrodynamics has been bet-
ter understood since the discussion by block and nordsieck[1]. they pointed
out the fact that the number of soft photons has no clear meaning and is
not an observable. in fact, in any scattering process involving charged parti-
cles an innite number of soft photons is emited collectively. lately, yennie,
frautsch and suura[2] showed that nite cross sections from divergent s ma-
trix elements are obtained if all radiative corrections are taken into account.
an alternative approach to the problem using coherent states to represent
the asymptotic states with nite s matrix elements was proposed by chung
[3]. he showed that all the s matrix elements can be made nite if a suit-
able representation of photon states composed by coherent states is chosen,
rather than the usual fock representation. kulish and faddeev [4] proposed
to modify not only the space of asymptotic states but also to redene the
scattering operator where the exact contribution of soft photons is taken into
account[5, 6].

interest in developing quantum electrodynamics in three dimensional
space-time is still growing. although some lower dimensional models have
less physical content than those in four dimensions, they may provide new
insights, by avoiding many problems encountered in four dimensions, serving
as a theoretical laboratory. for instance, it is known that einstein grav-
ity in four dimensional spacetime suers from serious problems such as its
non-renormalizability ; however, the topological massive planar gravity is
unitary and renormalizable. in the same way, the treatment of infrared di-
vergencies in three dimensional gauge vector models can be performed by
adding a topological gauge invariant mass term in the lagrangean, which
provides an infrared cuto to the theory[7, 8]. furthermore, planar gauge
theories have physical applications such as high-temperature limits of four
dimensional eld theories and the quantum hall eect.

here we are concerned with the investigation of the infrared behaviour
of qed3, instead of calculating cross-sections explicitly. so we follow the
pioneering work of murota[9], which sheds light into the asymptotic limit
of the theory. however, in contrast to the most of lower dimensional prob-

1

lems which provide a simple setting where basic physical phenomena can be
worked out, these divergencies are more drastic in three dimensions than in
four and the interpretation of the results in the rst case is not so obvious.
the basic idea is to consider the exact contribution of the soft photons in
the construction of the asymptotic time evolution operator in the s operator
denition.

in the next section we shall see that the soft photon contribution to the
s matrix may be isolated in a single time evolution operator, by making an
arbitrary separation of the interaction hamiltonian. section 3 is devoted to
an examination of the physical content of this operator. the conclusions are
summarized in section 4.

2 preliminaries

the starting point of the approach is to perform an arbitrary splitting of
the interaction hamiltonian in hs , which contains soft photons, and hh the
remaining one, i.e.,

h(t) = hs(t) + hh(t).

thus, the s matrix is given by



s = t exp(cid:20)iz +
= u (, t0) shu (t0,) ,
u (t, t0) = t exp(cid:20)iz t
sh = t exp(cid:20)iz +



dt (hs (t) + hh (t))(cid:21)

t0

d hs ( )(cid:21)
dthh (t)(cid:21) .

(2.1)

(2.2)

(2.3)

where

and

note that the soft part of the hamiltonian is all contained in the operator
in
u (t, t0), so that its analysis will be the main purpose of this paper.
addition, equation (2.1) is of fundamental importance because one stablishes
the relation between the infrared (ir) behaviour and asymptotic dynamics.

2

in order to prove this relation we use the fact that hs(t) and hh(t) commute.
therefore,

s = t(cid:26)exp(cid:20)iz +



dths (t)(cid:21)(cid:20)1  iz dt1hh (t1) +

+

(i)2
2!

z .dt1z dt2u (+, t1) hh (t1) u (t1, t2) hh (t2) u (t2,) + ...) .

(2.4)

in this way, the nth order term of s matrix in the perturbation series with
respect to hh(t) is given by

s(n) = (i)nz dt1...dtn (t1  t2)  (t2  t3) ... (tn1  tn)

(2.5)
u (+, t1) hh (t1) u (t1, t2) hh (t2) ...u (tn1, tn) hh (tn) u (tn, +) .

inserting complete sets before and after hh(ti), we see that the dependence
of hh(ti) is given by the dierence between energies of states before and after
ti

hh (ti)  eiet.

on the other hand, we shall see that the ti dependence in the operators
u (tni, ti) and u (ti, tn+i) is as follows

u (tni, ti) , u (ti, tn+i) x eip pk

e ti.

(2.6)

but, taking into account that the energy of soft photons is very small that
the hard ones, namely,

we may use the approximation

ei (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)
|ei| (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)x p  k

,

(2.7)

u (tni, ti) hh (ti) u (ti, tn+i)  u (tni, t0) hh (ti) u (t0, tn+i) .

(2.8)

since u (ti, t0)  1, (2.5) can be approximated by

s(n) = u (, t0)

(i)n
n!

z dt1...dtnt [hh (t1) ...hh (tn)] u (t0,) .

the above result holds for all n, and hence (2.1) is proved.

3 construction of the infrared operator in

qed3

we now shall construct u (t, t0) which contains the infrared behaviour of the
theory.

in the interaction picture, the qed hamiltonian of the system of charged

particles and photons is

we now turn to investigate the infrared behaviour of the interaction

hamiltonian, by making use of the following asymptotic approximations

rs,

it is easy to see that the time dependence of hs(t) split into two groups,
p0 t. thus, after time inte-

one is proportional to e2ipot and the other to e
gration, the former is smaller than the latter due the fact that

so that all those terms of the rst group can be neglected.

it is important to notice that the vertex approximation (3.14) is spin
independent; therefore, it is usually called eikonal in a sense that charged
particles act as pointlike sources.

replacing these approximations into (3.9) one nally obtains the interac-
tion hamiltonian, which describes the interaction between charged particles
and soft photons:

hs (t) =

substituting (3.15) in (2.2) we obtain u (t, t0) in form of a t-ordered
product. this expression can be transformated in to an ordinary product by
noting that hs (t) possesses the following property

[hs (t1) , hs (t2)] = c  number,  t1 6= t2,

(3.17)

which commutes with hs (t) for all t, t1, t2. by making use of this commuta-
tion relation, one readily obtain a more suitable form for the time evolution
operator

the s matrix is dened in (2.1) in the limit t, s  . in order to
simplify the calculations we shall take t0 = 0, since the time t0 is a nite
parameter chosen between  < t0 < + .

then, the construction of the asymptotic part of the s matrix is made

by replacing these limits in the operators u (t, t0), namely,

u (, 0) = exp [r (, 0)] exp [i (, 0)] ,

4 discussion

from the above result, we see that the i.r. structure of the theory is made
explicit. furthermore, it is instructive to compare the i.r. behaviour of
the phase operator (3.24) in 3d and that one in 4d. in the latter case, the
divergent coulomb phase as a function of the photon frequency does have

7

the same logarithm behaviour as that one when the same infrared analysis is
made in terms of the asymptotic times[9, 10], while it is not true in 3d[11].
moreover, the operators r (, 0) are not well dened in the fock space
for photons and charged particles.
in fact, when applied on states which
belong to the fock space, they yield coherent states. in other words, they
force us to introduce a new space of asymptotic states, the space of coherent
states, which contains a innite number of soft quanta and, therefore, be-
comes necessary to sum over nal and initial states and not only over nal
states as claimed by the block-nordsieck theory.
