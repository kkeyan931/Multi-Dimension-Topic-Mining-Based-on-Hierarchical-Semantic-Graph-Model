abstract

the so(2, 10) covariant extension of m-theory superalgebra is
considered, with the aim to construct a correspondingly generalized
m -theory, or 11d supergravity. for the orbit, corresponding to the
11d supergravity multiplet, the simplest unitary representations of
the bosonic part of this algebra, with sixth-rank tensor excluded, are
constructed on a language of eld theory in 66d space-time. the main
peculiarities are the presence of more than one equation of motion and
corresponding lagrangians for a given eld and that the gauge and
susy invariances of the theory mean that the sum of variations of
these lagrangians (with dierent variations of the same eld) is equal
to zero.

1 introduction

recent progress in the investigation of theories with maximal supersymmetry
leads to the notions of m and f theories[1], unifying many previously dis-
connected ones, such as 11d supergravity, superstrings, branes, etc. one of
the lessons of this progress is that all features of the supersymmetry algebra
appear to be important and contain interesting information on the physics
behind them. here we make an attempt to develop a systematic approach,
aimed at using the well known property of maximally extended 11d super-
symmetry algebra, namely its invariance with respect to so(2, 10) rotations
[2]. this feature has been discussed in a number of papers [3] - [11], where,
in particular, twelve-dimensional theories were constructed, the particles and
branes models, etc. what is the motivation for an so(2, 10) approach to the
m- theory superalgebra?

the 11-dimensional supersymmetry algebra with maximal number of
central charges [12] (which are not central but rather are tensors with
respect to the space-time rotations) has the following anticommutator of su-
percharges

n q, qo = ipi + ijzij + ijklmzijklm,

i, j, ... = 0, 1, 2, ..10

(1)

here the qs are 11d majorana spinors, pi are the usual momenta, and ten-
sors zij, zijklm the abovementioned central charges. the interesting feature
of this relation is its so(2, 10) invariance, which means that it is invari-
ant with respect to the so(2, 10) group of rotations of space-time with two
times and 10 space coordinates. thus 11 dimensional majorana spinors
q can be identied as 12d majorana-weyl spinors, and generators on the
r.h.s. combine into a 12d tensor p and a selfdual sixth-rank tensor z +
.
instead of (1) we have now in 12d notation

n q, qo = p + z +

, ... = 0, 0, 1, ...10



(2)

reducing the right hand side from 12d to 11d notation we obtain again
relation (1). the important dierence between these two relations is the
absence in the second one of the vector object, momentum pi. we ignore rst

2

supercharges q , and consider the pure poincare algebra, implied by (2),
which now consists of the usual generators of so(2, 10) rotations and tensors
p with evident commutation relations: components of p are mutually
commutative, and transform as second rank tensors under rotations. we
shall obtain features, which dier considerably from the usual ones. the
main dierence originats from the presence of many invariants (casimirs
operators), constructed from p:

t rp 2 = pp ,
t rp 4 = pp pp ,

...

t rp 12 = p1p 12...p 11.

(3)

instead of the single one in 11d : p 2 = pip i. of course, in 11d, one can
also obtain a lot of invariants if one considers those constructed from pi
and tensors zij, zijklm. but it is not necessary, and the minimal theory
(i.e. 11d supergravity) can be constructed starting from pi only. from the
so(2, 10) point of view we are forced to switch on tensorial charges from
the beginning. here we shall consider the problem of construction of eld
theories with tensor p instead of the usual momenta pi. the nal goal is
the construction of a theory with so(2, 10) invariance, which has to reduce
to 11d theories under some conditions. in particular, although the algebra (2)
has many dierent bps representations [3], there is one, which corresponds
to the usual bps representation of 11d supergravity - massless superparticle
multiplet. this is the multiplet, corresponding to the orbit of a particular
tensor

p = (p0i, pij = 0),
p 2 = p0ip 0i = 0,
p 0i = (1, 1, 0, ..., 0)

(4)
(5)
(6)

from the so(2, 10) point of view, the (compact) little group of this orbit is
so(9), exactly as in 11d superalgebra, and the representations are the same,
in particular the smallest representation of the corresponding superalgebra
includes one spin-vector (128 degrees of freedom), a traceless second-rank
tensor (44), and an antisymmetric third rank tensor (84). one should note
also that the natural space on which the algebra with so(2, 10) and p

3

generators is realized is not 12d space-time, but 66d space-time with co-
ordinates x  - antisymmetric tensor of second rank. the orbit referred to
has the property, that all polynomial invariants (3) are equal to zero. the
entire little group of this orbit can be found from its lie algebra: consider
all elements of so(2, 10) algebra, which leave the tensor (4) unchanged. ac-
tually (4) itself, with raised second index (we use mostly plus signature),
is an element of so(2, 10), so we are seeking its stabilizer in this algebra. it is
easy to show, that the following matrices of so(2, 10) are exactly all matrices,
commuting with (4):

the algebra of matrixes (7) is a direct sum of the so(1, 1) algebra of
matrices (7) with only non-zero entry a, and an algebra, which is a semidirect
sum of so(9) (represented by matrixes (7) with a = b = c = ... = d = 0)
and an abelian algebra of matrices (7) with non-zero elements b, c, ..., d only.
the unitary nite-dimensional representations of this little group algebra are
those of so(9) subalgebra, with other generators represented by zero, which
is possible due to the structure of the algebra.

the main feature of theories of this kind (i.e. those having p instead
of pi in the algebra of symmetries) is the appearance of many lagrangians -
even in the case of one scalar eld - which are simultaneously necessary for
the description of the theory. or, equivalently, many equations of motion for
the same eld are necessary, which is immediately connected with the exis-
tence of many invariants of p.their role is to bring the general function of
the momenta p to a function on the orbit of so(2, 10). the notion of a
symmetry generalizes in this case, as we shall see below, to the single equa-
tion, which implies that a sum of variations of these actions, with dierent
innitesimal variation of the same eld in dierent actions, is equal to zero.
in the following we shall discuss mainly the theories without supersym-
metry generators. supersymmetry will appear in section 6. also, an algebra

4

of symmetry will be generalized to the semidirect product of so(2, q) and that
of p which are tensors under so(2, q) lorenz rotation, and components of
p commute with themselves. we are mainly interested in q = 10, but some
examples will be considered for q = 2. in sections 3, 4, 5 scalar, spinor and
vector elds, respectively, are considered. section 2 contains the discussion
of orbits in the case of q=2. the conclusion is devoted to the discussion of
results and prospects.

2 classication of orbits: example of q=2

the method of induced representations requires the classication of all orbits
of the group so(2, 10) on the space of tensors p. this classication can be
presented in a form of a list of representatives, one for each orbit, socalled
standard forms of p. it is also convenient to have an identication of orbits
with values of invariants, constructed from p, i.e. (3). this correspondence
can be easily obtained if standard forms are known. the classication for
the (2 + 10)d case is not known to us. it is known in a simpler case, e.g.
for maxwell eld strength in (1 + 3)d (see, e.g. [14]). here we shall present
this for the case of so(2, 2). in this case the space of tensors p can be
invariantly divided into two subspaces of self-dual and antiself-dual tensors,
which have, correspondingly, the forms (with second index raised)

p +

(9)

and

the triplets (a, b, c) and (k, l, n) transform under algebra so(2, 2) as vectors
with respect to the two so(1, 2) subalgebras of so(2, 2) = so(1, 2) + so(1, 2).
correspondingly (neglecting some subtleties concerning factorization over
discrete subgroups) these vectors can be brought to the dierent forms de-
pending on the values of their squares, namely to the forms (m, 0, 0), (0, 0, m)

5

and(1, 0, 1). substitution of these forms into (8), (9) gives the standard forms
of p 
. the invariants, which dene to which orbit a given p belongs are
traces of squares of self-dual and antiself-dual parts of p:

 p +
p +

 = 4(a2 + b2 + c2)

(10)

p 
 p 

 = 4(k2 + l2 + n2)

the cases of negative, positive, and zero values of these invariants correspond
to the three abovementioned forms of tensors (8) and (9). in particular, it is
easy to see, that the case of both invariants equal to zero gives the matrix of
the form (4), (5) and (6).

3 scalar eld

according to the little group method of construction of the unitary represen-
tations of semidirect product groups, we have to choose a particular value
of p, take a particular unitary representation of the corresponding little
group, which is, by denition, the subgroup of so(2, q), which leaves that
particular p unchanged, and induce this representation on the whole group.
in eld theories with the usual poincare symmetry it is known that the same
representations can be described also in the language of elds and their equa-
tions of motion. in the simplest case of scalar (trivial) representation of the
little group it is necessary to use the space of the usual functions on the
orbit, which can be described in this case as the space of functions (p),
satisfying the equations of motion

(t rp 2  2m2
(t rp 4  2m4

(t rp 12  2m12

1)(p) = 0,
2)(p) = 0,
...
6 )(p) = 0

(11)

the rst is the equation of the usual klein-gordon type, the others are on the
same footing as the rst one, and altogether they dene functional (p)
on the orbit, which is characterized by the numbers m1, m2, ..., m6. it is easy
to check that on the orbit (4) this set of equations of motion reduces to the

6

usual klein-gordon equation in 11d:

(p0ip 0i  m2

1)(p0i) = 0

m2 = m3 = m4 = m5 = m6 = m1

(12)

actions, giving (11), are, in a coordinate representations,

1

2 z [dx ]((x)(

si =

i = 1, 2, ...6.



x 12

...



x 2i1 2i

 m2i

i )(x))

(13)

the question, whether it is possible to replace this set of lagrangians by a
single one, giving all necessary equations (11), is open, even in the simplest
case of the scalar eld. for the other hand, eld theory can be considered as
a second-quantized version of the theory of particles. this particle hamilto-
nian, giving the same equations (11) as an equation for the wave function of
the quantized particle, can be represented in a standard form:

h = 1(t rp 2  2m2

1) + ... + 6(t rp 12  2m12
6 )

(14)

where i are arbitrary gauge functions (consequently, functions, multiplying
them, are constraints to be imposed on a wave function, cf. eqs. (11)). we
can dene the lagrangian after exclusion of momenta in the usual relation:

l = p x   h

(15)

it may be worth mentioning, that a very similar problem was discussed many
years ago by fiertz and pauli [13]1 they considered, particularly, the prob-
lem of construction of the lagrangian for higher spin massive theories. these
theories are described by a few equations of the same eld, as in the present
situation, and fierz and pauli developed the method of introduction of auxil-
iary elds, leading to a single lagrangian, with an equivalent set of equations
of motion.

1we are indebted to m. vasiliev for bringing this article to our attention.

4 dirac equation(s)

we now consider the spinor  as a function of tensorial momenta p with
the following set of equations of motion:

12p12(p) = 0
1234p12p34(p) = 0
123456p12p34p56(p) = 0
12...8p12p34p56p78(p) = 0
12...10p12p34...p910(p) = 0
12...12p12 ......p1112(p) = 0

(16)
(17)
(18)
(19)
(20)
(21)

and actions:

si =

i = 1, 2, ...6,

 = t 00

1

2 z [dx ]( (x)(12...2i12i



x 12

...



x 2i1 2i

)(x)) (22)

again we can check that on the orbit(4) this set is equivalent to the 11d
dirac equation:

then one can check that on-shell scalar invariants are zero (3) :

0ip0i(p0i) = 0

t rp 2(p) = 0,
t rp 4(p) = 0,

...

t rp 12(p) = 0.

(23)

(24)
(25)

(26)

to prove this, one has to multiply equations (16) to (21) on dierent matrices
like:

p , p p, ....

and make some -algebra calculations. for example, squaring (16), we have:

12p1234p34(p) =

(cid:16)1234 p12 p34 + 2t rp 2(cid:17) (p) = 0

(27)

8

i.e. eq.. (24). multiplying (16) on 12p 3

12 we obtain

12p 3

1234p34(p) =

(cid:16)1234 p 3

12 p34 + 2t rp 4(cid:17) (p) = 0

squaring (17) and using (24) and higher equations from (16) to (21), we
obtain

(28)

(29)

(1234p12p34)2 (p) =

(cid:16)321234p 3

12p34 + 16t rp 4(cid:17) (p) = 0

from (28), (29) and (24) follows (25) and so on. equivalently, it is possible
to use instead of (16) to (21) equations (16) and

gi(p )(p) = 0,

i = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6

(30)
(31)

here gi are combinations of invariants dened below in (44). equations (30)
express higher invariants through t rp 2 and (16) gives the on-shell condition
t rp 2 = 0 and xes the spinor structure of .

5 vector eld and gauge invariance

we consider the abelian vector eld satisfying the usual maxwell equation:

pjf ji = (cid:16)p 2ij + p ip j(cid:17) aj = 0

this equation has a u(1) gauge invariance:

ai = pi(pi)

(32)

(33)

which allows one to impose a gauge xing condition o-shell and remove the
longitudinal component:

assuming p 2 6= 0 we can rewrite the maxwell equation (32) as:

p iai = 0

p jpjatr

i = p 2 j

i 

pip j

p 2 ! aj = 0

9

(34)

(35)

this equation means that atr
i = 0 which implies the absence of physical
degrees of freedom. therefore on-shell we have to put p 2 = 0 and p iai = 0
which means in an appropriate frame: pi = (1, 1, 0, 0, ...) and a0 = a1.
these relations are equivalent to well-known result that an on-shell vector
eld has d  2 physical components with the massless condition p 2 = 0.

we now turn to the construction of the vector eld theory in an so(2, 10)

invariant way. using the vector a(p) and the eld strength

f = pa + pa + pa

we can dene the following set of equations of motion:

p f = 0
(p 3) f = 0
...
(p 11) f = 0

an equivalent set of equations is:

p f = 2(cid:18)p 2

 

1
2

gi(p )a = 0

i = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6

t rp 2

(cid:19) a = 0

(36)

(37)
(38)
(39)
(40)

(41)

(42)
(43)

here gi with g1 =  1
2 t rp 2 are combinations of invariants (3) coinciding
with the coecients in the expansion of the characteristic polynomial for
matrix p 

:



f (x) = det(p  x)

(44)

= x12 + x10g1 + x8g2 + ... + g6

again this set is equivalent to the ordinary maxwell system under the con-
dition pij = 0 and therefore reproduces the masslessness condition p 2 = 0.
we can now dene the set of actions corresponding to equations (41) to

(42) in coordinate space:

1
6

s1 = z [dx ](cid:18)
si = z [dx ](cid:18)1

2

f f(cid:19) ,
agi(x  )a(cid:19) ,

i = 2, 3, ..6.

10

(45)

(46)

actions, corresponding to the other form of equations of motion (37) to (40)
are:

k1 = z [dx ](cid:18)
ki = z [dx ](cid:18)1

2

i = 1, 2, ...6.

1
6

f f(cid:19) ,
a( t r(p 2i2)  2(p 2i2))a(cid:19) ,

another possible set of actions is

n1 = z [dx ](cid:18)
ni = z [dx ](cid:18)

i = 1, 2, ...6.

1
6
1
6

f f(cid:19) ,

f (p 2i2)

f(cid:19) ,

(47)

(48)

(49)

(50)

(51)

(52)

what about gauge invariance? we can dene the following set of variations
corresponding to each equation of the set

1a(p) = p 10
2a(p) = p 8

 (p)
(p)

(53)

.

.

6a(p) = (p)

then it is easy to see that the following equation is satised:

1s1 + 2s2 + .... + 6s6 = 0

(54)

due to the well-known hamilton-cayley identity for characteristic polynomi-
als:

where

f (p ) = 0

f (x) = det(p  x)

(55)

(56)

the equation similar to (54) is valid for other sets of actions, with dierent

variations ia. under the condition pij = 0 the remaining symmetry is:

a0(p0i) = p 10
ai(p0i) = p 10

0(p0i) = 
i (p0i) = pi0

(57)
(58)

11

the rst of these can be used for gauging away the additional twelfth compo-
nent a0, the second gives the usual gauge transformation for the remaining
11d abelian gauge eld. the subtlety is that:
if we consider the on-shell
condition p 2 = 0 from the beginning, it is not possible to gauge away a0, as
is seen from (57). it is not clear, whether this subtlety spoils the equivalence
of the space of solutions of (37) (or (41), (42)) with the corresponding unitary
representation of the group considered.

6 supersymmetry

in this section we will consider (2 + 2)d supersymmetric theories realizing the
following algebra of supersymmetry:

n q, qo =  p

, ... = 0, 0, 1, 2.

(59)

we rst dene actions and the supersymmetry transformation for the super-
symmetry multiplets in the (2 + 2)d theory, containing majorana spinor and
scalar and spinor and vector elds. for the scalar (wess-zumino) multiplet
we can dene the actions :

s1 =

s2 =

2 z [dx ] g2 + 1234

x 34

and variations of elds:

1 = ,

1 =

1
2

12



x 12



2 = ,

2 = 0

(60)

(61)

(62)

(63)

the commutator of transformation (62) is  p, according to algebra (59),
the commutator of (63) is zero.

it is easy to check the following supersymmetry relation:

1s1 + 2s2 = 0

(64)

12

again, as in the case of gauge invariance, the statement of supersymmetry is
of the kind of (54): the sum of variations of actions of dierent dimensionality
is equal to zero.

similar equations for the vector multiplet are:

it is possible to nd additional symmetries in the above actions which, how-
ever, may not be important since all these theories are free.

7 conclusion

in the above we considered the construction of eld theories, the space-time
algebra of symmetries of which is a semidirect sum of so(2, q) and the abelian
algebra of second-rank tensors p. the reason is that the bosonic part of
the m-theory algebra has this form, with q = 10, modulo a sixth-rank cen-
tral charge, and the aim of the present investigation is the development of
an so(2, 10)-invariant approach to m-theory. this algebra diers from the
usual poincare one in two respects: the momentum pi is replaced by p, and
second time-like direction appears in the metric. the free theories of scalar,
spinor, vector elds are constructed, as well as the supersymmetric free the-
ory for q = 2. one of the main features, which is dierent in the present
situation from the usual ones, is the necessity of having simultaneously many
lagrangians for the same eld. this follows from the existence of many in-
variants, constructed from p, which all have to be xed for a given unitary

13

representation of algebra of symmetry. for a scalar eld, e.g., these equa-
tions are klein-gordon ones and their higher derivative analogs. another
peculiarity is the form of the gauge and susy invariance. the lagrangians
mentioned are not separately invariant with respect to these transformations,
but only the sum of their variations - with dierent variations of the same
eld in dierent lagrangians - is equal to zero. it is well-known, that free
theories can possess very dierent kinds of algebras of symmetries, and only
interaction selects the very few, such as susy algebra. so, it is important to
have an example of an interacting theory. this can be constructed for q = 2.
the similar example for q = 10 would be an explicitly so(2, 10)-invariant
formalism for 11d supergravity, unknown so far. it is possible to construct
that on a linearized level, which will be discussed separately.

the interesting question is the construction of extended objects with ex-
plicit so(2, 10) invariance, appropriate for this hypothetical form of 11d
supergravity. we refer to [11],[8] and [9],[10] for some suggestions.
