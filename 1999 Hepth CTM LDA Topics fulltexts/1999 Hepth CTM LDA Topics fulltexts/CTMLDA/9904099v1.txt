introduction

in modern day theoretical physics one often deals with additional dimensions
besides the ordinary four space-time ones. these extra dimensions manifest
themselves in dierent forms. in gauge theory they appear as the dimension
of the gauge group, in m-theory and string theory, they are required for self-
consistency. in kaluzaklein theory, the gauge theory is obtained by compact-
ication over an internal manifold with an isometry group which equals the
gauge group. the almost product structure concept makes possible a geomet-
rical formulation which completely describe these theories, without performing
the dimensional reduction. this leads to new insights in their geometrical prop-
erties which is unobtainable in the dimensionally reduced theories themselves.
for instance in ref.
[1] it was shown that the nijenhuis tensor of a certain
almost product structure measures the eldstrength which in the geometrical
language is a measure of the non-integrability of the base manifold of the prin-
cipal bundle. in almost product manifolds, three dierent connections appear
naturally. as is known the gausscodazzi relations connect curvature compo-
nents of these connections. in this paper a classication of the relations of all
curvature components is given which yields a number of new identities. as a
result it becomes manifest that the vidal connection in a principal bundle, or
kaluzaklein theory, reduces to the gauge-covariant derivative. since a lot of
recent work [2, 3] has been made concerning rotating branes which are solu-
tions to various supergravity theories, it will here be stressed that the almost
product manifold vievpoint would be the most geometrical approach to these
problems. direct relations for the ricci tensors in terms of the characteristic
deformation tensors of an almost product structure will be given. these will
then be the most natural starting point when making ansatze for new solutions
in the supergravity theories.

in the generic case, the vidal connection will not be metric neither torsion
free, and in section 2 we give a review of the theory of general connections.
we refer to [4] for a more detailed treatise in this respect.
in section 2 the
properties of an arbitrary connection under conformal transformations are also
reviewed. section 3 gives a quick introduction to the basic connections and
tensors involved with almost product manifolds. the naturally occuring con-
nections, besides the levicivita one, is the vidal and adapted connections.
all tensors formed from these connections are investigated in section 4. in that
section several new identities are derived, some of which follows directly from
the work in ref. [5], and the conformal properties are studied. in section 5 this
is brought to full fruition when the vidal connection is shown to be identical to
the gauge-covariant derivative in gauge or kaluzaklein theory. possible further
developments in this area is discussed in section 6.

2 a review on general connections

this section consists of two parts, the rst of which treats a general non-metric
connection and its curvature relations together with the bianchi identities. the
second part deals with the induced transformation of an arbitrary connection
under conformal transformations.

1

2.1 non-metric connections

the most frequently used non-levi-civita connections are the ones in which the
torsion content is non-zero. in the case of a vidal connection, the connection
will not in general be metric nor symmetric. also in the case of embeddings
one might encounter non-metric connections while studying cases with an aux-
illiary metric on the world-volume. in this subsection a thorough description of
connections in the most general case is given. see also ref. [4]. to this end, the
following two important tensor are dened as,

denition 2.1
let  be a connection in a manifold m with non-degenerate metric g. now
dene the torsion tensor, t , and the non-metricity tensor, q, respectively with
characteristics,

t : 1  1 7 1
q : 1  1  1 7 r

by the following equations

t (x, y ) := x y  y x  [x, y ]

q(x, y, z) := (x g)(y, z)

where x, y, z  1 are vectorelds on m .

a general connection on a manifold with non-degenerate metric can be decom-
posed into the levi-civita connection and an arbitrary (2, 1)-tensor. the di-
mension of this tensor is therefore m3 where m is the dimension of the manifold
m . below it is shown that it can be decomposed into one part containing only
the torsion tensor, t , and one part containing only the non-metricity tensor, q.
these two tensors have the dimensions 1
2 m2(m+1) respectively
which together give m3. the torsion do not appear directly in the connection
but as the contorsion and that is also the case with the non-metricity tensor.
the following notation will be used in what follows,

2 m2(m1) and 1

t (x, y, z) := g(t (x, y ), z)

in the next proposition the contorsion and con-metricity tensors are dened.

denition 2.2
let  be a connection in a manifold m with non-degenerate metric g. dene
the contorsion tensor, s, and the con-metricity tensor, p , respectively, with
same characteristics,

s, p : 1  1  1 7 r

by following equations

s(x, y, z) :=

p (x, y, z) :=

1
2
1
2

(t (x, y, z)  t (y, z, x) + t (z, x, y ))

(q(x, y, z)  q(y, z, x) + q(z, x, y ))

where x, y, z  1 are vectorelds on m and s(x, y ) = g1(s(x, y, )), p (x, y ) =
g1(p (x, y, )).

2

now, any connection can be expressed in terms of the levi civita connection
with respect to a non-degenerate metric, denoted by g, plus the contorsion and
the con-metricity tensors dened above, i.e,

proposition 2.3
let  be an arbitrary connection on a manifold m , let further g be a non-
degenerate metric on m and g corresponding levi-civita connection. let
s, p be the tensors dened in 2.2 .then

x y = gx y + s(x, y ) + p (x, y )

the curvature tensor of an arbitrary connection, is dened by,

r(x, y )z := [x , y ]z  [x,y ]z,

(1)

will no longer take values in the lie algebra o(m) as does the curvature tensor of
the levi-civita connection, but (will in the generic case take values) in gl(m).
the identities of the curvature tensor will therefor be altered, and its irreducible
parts look in the generic case like





=









.

proposition 2.4
the four identities of the riemann curvature tensor of an arbitrary connection
are

3
2
+ rab(cd)  rbc(da)  rcd(ab) + rda(bc) + rac(db)  rdb(ac)

by the skew-tableaux (the two tableaux on the right in equation (2) above) it
is stressed that these two irreducible parts will vanish when the connection is
metric, i.e, the right hand side of identity 3 vanishes. in the generic case there
are two possible contractions that can be made.

denition 2.5
let  be an arbitrary connection on a manifold m with curvature tensor, r.
from the curvature it is possible to construct two types of (2, 0) tensors by
contraction, namely,

c,
rab := racb
c.
vab := rabc

3

the rst one is the generalized ricci tensor and the second one will here be
refered to as the schouten two-form.

the identities of the ricci and schouten tensors can be read o directly from
the original curvature identities.

proposition 2.6
let rab be the ricci tensor and vab the schouten tensor of an arbitrary con-
nection, , then the second and third curvature identities implythe relations,

2r[ab] = vab  ctab

vab = ([aq)b]

the only integrability conditions to the curvature identities are the bianchi
identities.

proposition 2.7
let  be an arbitrary connection with curvature tensor r, and torsion tensor
t . then the bianchi identity reads

[arbc]d

e = t[ab

from which the identities involving the ricci tensor rab, and the schouten two-
form v , are derived,

2.2 conformal transformations

below, conformal transformations in the case of an arbitrary connection are
studied. there will be some changes compared to the ordinary levi civita case
when the connection involves torsion and non-metricity.

denition 2.8
let m be a manifold with metric g, let further  be an arbitrary connec-
tion on m . let cg := e2g denote a conformal transformation then dene the
conformal tensor, denoted by c , with characteristics

by

c :

1  1 7 1,

c (x, y ) := cx y  x y

where x, y  1 are vectorelds on m .

by a straight forward calculation one ends up with the transformations of the
characteristic tensors of a connection under conformal transformation.

4

proposition 2.9
let m be a manifold with metric g and  be an arbitrary connection on m .
let r, t, q denote the riemann, torsion and non-metricity tensors respectively.
then their transformations under a conformal transformation can be expressed
in terms of the conformal tensor, c , as

cr(x, y )z  r(x, y )z =(x c )(y, z)  (y c )(x, z) +

ct (x, y )  t (x, y ) =c (x, y )  c (y, x),

+ c (x, c (y, z))  c (y, c (x, z)) + c (t (x, y ), z),

cq(x, y, z)  e2q(x, y, z) =e2[2x[]g(y, z)  g(c (x, y ), z)  g(y, c (x, z))]

in the case of the levi-civita connection the conformal tensor is most easily
extracted from the above proposition.

proposition 2.10
let g be the levi-civita connection on a manifold with non-degenerate metric
g, then its conformal tensor, denoted by gc , reads

gc (x, y ) = x[]y + y []x  g(x, y )d

from these two propositions the conformal tensor in the generic case can be
derived.

proposition 2.11
let  be an arbitrary connection on a manifold m with non-degenerate metric
g, let further s, p denote the contorsion and the con-metricity tensor respec-
tively. then the conformal tensor of  reads

c (x, y ) = gc (x, y ) + cs(x, y )  s(x, y ) + cp (x, y )  p (x, y )

3 the connections associated with an almost prod-

uct structure

here a quick review on the concepts of almost product structures will be given,
for a more thorough treatise see refs. [1, 6].

notation 3.1
we will denote the objects on our space with an underline, i.e.,

m

t m

g

tangent bundle of m
cotangent bundle of m

metric on m

exterior derivative

to list the primarily used objects. we will use this underlining principle for all
objects on m whenever there may be risk of confusion.

denition 3.2
let i be an almost product structure on a manifold m with riemannian metric
g and let x, y  t m be vector elds. then the triplet (m , g, i) is called
an riemannian almost product structure or simply an almost product
manifold if

g(ix, iy ) = g(x, y )

or in other words, i is a automorphism of g in the sense that the following
diagram commutes:

t m

g

i

/ t m

g

t m

/ t m

i t

i t  g  i = g

i.e.,

proposition 3.3
let the triplet (m , g, i) dene a riemannian almost product structure on m
with dim m = m, then

(i). i 2 = 1

(ii). all eigenvalues are 1.

(iii). tri = 2k  m, where k is the number of positive eigenvalues.

(iv). i  gr(k, m)  o(m)/(o(k)  o(m  k)).

(v). there is a preferred base called the oriented base in which i is diagonal

and ordered, i.e., it takes the form

the almost product structure will serve as a rigging of the tangentbundle by
looking at the spaces of eigenvectors to the almost product structure.

denition 3.4
let i be an almost product structure on m , then i denes two natural distri-
butions of t m , denoted d and d respectively, in the following way. let

then

seen as an endomorphism of the tangent bundle two projection operators can
be formed from the almost product structure as it squares to one. these will
now be projective mappings from the tangent bundle to these two sub-bundles
dened above.

denition 3.5
from an almost product structure i on a manifold m we can dene two pro-
jection operators through

p :=

:=

(1 + i)

(1  i).

these will be mappings in the sense p : t m  d and p  : t m  d respec-
tively.

the riemann metric in the triplet of a almost product manifold will now split
into two parts which will be the induced metrics on these two sub-bundles of
the tangent bundle.

denition 3.6
let m be a riemannian or pseudo-riemannian manifold with metric, g, i a
reective structure with p and p  the corresponding projectors, then dene the
two associated metrics with respect to the reective structure by

g(x, y ) := g(px, py ),

g(x, y ) := g(p x, p y )

which implies that g splits into these two parts, i.e.,

g = g + g.

3.1 tensors associated with an almost product structure

there is one main tensor in the context of almost product manifolds and that
is the deformation tensor. this tensor is most suitably decomposed into two
irreducible parts namely the nijenhuis tensor and the jordan tensor.

7

denition 3.7
let the triplet (m , g, i) dene a riemannian almost product structure and dene
the nijenhuis tensor as the measure of how much di fails to be a coboundary
operator. the nijenhuis tensor is thus a (2,1) tensor. let x, y  1 be vector
elds on m , then the characteristics of the nijenhuis tensor are

ni (x, y ) : 1  1 7 1

and we dene it through the quadratic action of di on functions f  c(m ),

< ni(x, y ), df >:= di di f (x, y ).

it follows that the nijenhuis tensor measures the failure in closure of the oper-
ator di and can thus be considered as a kind of torsion. alternatively, as the
equivalent denition below shows, it measures the curvature of the endomor-
phism, i.e.,

ni [x, y ] := i([x, y ]i )  [i(x), i(y )]

alternatively the nijenhuis tensor can be seen as measuring how far this endo-
morphism is from being a lie algebra homomorphism of the innite-dimensional
lie algebra of vector elds on m .

denition 3.8
let the triplet (m , g, i) dene a riemannian almost product structure, and let
{, } be the jordan bracket. the jordan tensor associated to i, denoted mi,
with the following characteristics:

is dened by,

mi : 1  1 7 1

mi (x, y ) := i{x, y }i  {ix, iy }

where x, y  1 are vector elds on m . the analogy to the nijenhuis tensor
is obvious .

both the nijenhuis and the jordan tenor can be expressed entirely in terms of
the covariant derivative of the almost product structure.

denition 3.9
let the triplet (m , g, i) dene a riemannian almost product structure. let 
be the levicivita connection on m and dene the deformation tensor asso-
ciated with the endomorphism i, denoted hi , with the following characteristics:

hi is dened by the expression

hi : 1  1 7 1

hi (x, y ) := (ix i  ix i)(y ),

where x, y  1 are two vector elds on m . an equivalent denition is given
by,

hi (x, y ) := ni (x, y ) + mi (x, y ).

8

looking at the characteristic tensors of a distribution the deformation tensor
of an almost product structure can now be decomposed into the deformation
tensors of the two complementary distributions dened by the almost product
structure.

denition 3.10
let d be a k-distribution with projection p on a riemannian manifold m with
non-degenerate metric g. let  be the levicivita connection with respect
to this metric and let p  := 1  p be the coprojection of d. now dene the
following tensors with characteristics

h, l, k : 1

d

and

 :

d  1
1

d 7 1
d 7 r

(i) h(x, y ) := p px py

deformation tensor,

(ii) l(x, y ) :=

(iii) k(x, y ) :=

1
2
1
2

(h(x, y )  h(y, x))

twisting tensor,

(h(x, y ) + h(y, x)) extrinsic curvature tensor,

(iv)

 := trh

mean curvature tensor,

(v) w (x, y ) := k(x, y ) 

1
k

g(x, y )

conformation tensor.

this gives us the decomposition of the deformation tensor in its anti-symmetric,
symmetric-traceless and trace parts accordingly,

h = l + w +

1
k

g.

the extrinsic curvature tensor and the twisting tensor can be written in a more
elegant fashion.

proposition 3.11
let d be a distribution on a manifold m with metric g, let further g(x, y ) =
g(px, py ) be the induced metric on the distribution, then the symmetric part
of the deformation tensor can be written like

1
k(x, y )() = 
2

l g(x, y ), or

1
k(x, y, z) = 
2

lz g(x, y ),

where the prime denotes projection along the normal directions by p . the
relation for the anti-symmetric part on the other hand is

l(x, y ) =

1
2

p [px, py ]

the conformal properties of the irreducible parts of the deformation tensor can
be found in next proposition.

9

proposition 3.12
let m be a riemannian manifold with metric g, let i be an almost product
structure on m which split the metric in g = g + g and let  = e2 be a
conformal transformation on g, i.e., cg = g then the symmetric parts of the
deformation tensor will transform like

1[]g = k()  []g

k1x [] = (x)  kx []

1
2
1
2

ck() = k() 

c(x) = (x) 

cw = w
cl = l

now denoting the deformation tensor of the complementary distribution d by
h  and its irreducible parts by l, k , , w  respectively we can express the
nijenhuis tensor and the jordan tensor in terms of these characteristic tensors.

3.2 three relevant connections

in a almost product manifold there are three dierent connections of importance,
which will be dened in this subsection. the rst is of course the levicivita
connection, from which the other two will be dened by simply adding a tensor
to it. these will be refered to as the adapted and the vidal connection. their
basic feature is that they commute with the almost product structure which
means that they respect the rigging of the tangent space dened by the almost
product structure. the additional feature of the adapted connection is that it
is metric which together with the above feature implies that it respects the in-
duced metrics on the two characteristic distributions associated with the almost
product structure. the vidal connection which is metric i the characteristic
distributions are geodesic will play an important role when looking at gauge
theories and ber bundles since they need no metric in the total space and are
of the type (gf, gd). by adding the group metric to the ber we can construct
an almost product manifold in which the vidal connection will reduce to the
gauge covariant derivative. this will be explicitly done in section 5. the curva-
ture components of the vidal connections lying entirely in the tensor algebra of
the characteristic distributions, also called the semi-basic parts, will in a more
natural way measure the curvature in the respective distributions. this is due
to the fact that it does not depend on the connections in its co-parts. what
this means explicitly will become clear when the relations are derived.

denition 3.17
let m be a riemannian or pseudo-riemannian manifold with non-degenerate
metric g and corresponding levicivita connection . let i dene distribu-
tions as in denition 3.4. then the following two denitions of the adapted
connection are equivalent

(i). x y := x y + a(x, y ), a(x, y ) := 1

2 ix i(y )

(ii). x y := px py + p x p y

denition 3.18
let m be a riemannian or pseudo-riemannian manifold with non-degenerate
metric g and corresponding levicivita connection , let i dene a foliation.
then the vidal connection is dened by

x y := x y + b(x, y ), b(x, y ) :=

1
4

(iy i + iy i)(x).

11

proposition 3.19
let x, y be vectorelds on an almost product manifold (m , g, i), let x =
px, x  = p x and similar for y . then the vidal connection can be written

x y = (cid:18) px y

p[x , y ] p x y  (cid:19)

p [x, y ]

the two recently introduced tensors, a and b, are in fact related.

proposition 3.20
let b be the tensor dened in 3.18 and a the tensor dened in 3.17, then it is
possible express the tensor b in terms of a and the almost product structure i
as

b(x, y ) =

1
2

(a(y, x)  a(iy, ix)) .

the most important property of the two connections dened above, is that they
both commute with the almost product structure.

proposition 3.21
let  denote the adapted connection dened in 3.17 and  the vidal connection
dened in 3.18, then their principal feature is that they both commute with the
almost product structure i, i.e.,

x i = x i = 0

only one of them though will, in the generic case, be metric and that is the
adapted connection.

proposition 3.22
let the triplet (m , g, i) be a riemannian almost product structure on m and
 the adapted connection dened in 3.17, then this connection is metric with
respect to the splitting of g according to 3.6, i.e.,

g = 0
g = 0

the connection components takes a most pleasant form in the oriented basis.
the notation,

e a = (e a, ea )

will be used, where unprimed(primed) index denotes the basis of the character-
istic unprimed(primed) distribution.

12

proposition 3.23
let the triplet (m , g, i) dene a riemannian almost product structure, let ,
 and  denote the connection one-forms of the levicivita connection, the
adapted connection and the vidal connection respectively. let furthermore
h, h  denote the deformation tensors with respect to i and c, c be coecients
of anholonomy then

4 the curvature components and their relations

as ber bundles and brations are examples of almost product manifolds with
the additional property of the existense of a surjective submersion of the total
space down to a base space, it would be interesting to see what parts of the vidal
and adapted connections, which are dened on the total space, that survive
under this submersion. in the total space two new dierential operators were
dened in [1].

denition 4.1
let i be an almost product structure on a manifold m with exterior derivative
d. let furthermore di denote the exterior derivative associated with i and dene
two new dierential operators by

d :=

d

:=

1
2
1
2

(d + di )

(d  di )

an equivalent denition is by the two projection operators dened by the en-
domorphism i, p := 1
2 (1  i), then the operators are simply
d  dp and d  dp .

2 (1 + i) and p  := 1

these dierential operators become coboundary operators if and only if the ni-
jenhuis tensor vanishes, which is the same as to say that both the characteristic
distributions of the almost product structure are integrable. in a bration for
instance this is not normally true, except for the trivial case of a product mani-
fold, so we will keep track of all components surviving the submersion and those

14

who will not. when it comes to these dierential operators it is therefor clear
that d dened above will in general dier from the exterior derivative dened
on the base space. by projecting out the semi-basic parts of all quantities we
can keep track of the parts that survives the submersion.

denition 4.2
let the triplet (m , g, i) denote a riemannian almost product structure and d,
d be the associated distributions then dene the brackets associated with these
distributions with following characteristics

[  ,  ]d : 1
[  ,  ]d
: 1

d  1
d  1

d 7 1
d,
d 7 1

d,

by

[x, y ]d := p[px, py ],
[x, y ]d
:= p [p x, p y ],

where x, y  1 are vectorelds on m .

here it is clear that the twisting tensor that measures the amount of non-
commutativity is non-semi-basic. the two brackets dened above will therefor
not satisfy the jacobi identity in the total space, but will dier with some terms
involving the twisting tensors. the same procedure can be made to dene the
semi-basic torsions and curvature tensor of a distribution.

denition 4.3
let the triplet (m , g, i) denote a riemannian almost product structure and
d, d be the associated distributions. let further t p
q (t m ) denote the set of
q (d)) denote the set of tensors lying entirely
(p, q)-tensors on m and t p
in d (d). now dene the associated levicivita connections with following
characteristics

q (d) (t p

x : t p
d
d
x : t p

q (t m ) 7 t p
q (t m ) 7 t p

q (d),
q (d),

through

d
x y :=ppx py,
d
x :=p p x p y,

where x, y  1 are vectorelds on m . further dene the torsion and curvature
of the corresponding connections by

t d(x, y ) := d
(x, y ) := d
t d

x y  d
x y  d

y x  [x, y ]d,
y x  [x, y ]d

,

and

rd(x, y )z := d
(x, y )z := d

x d
x d

y z  d
y z  d

y d
y d

rd

x z  d

[x,y ]dz,

x z  d

[x,y ]d z.

15

in this case it is clear that the curvature dened above, will not in general be
tensorial in the latter indices. as before these non-tensorial parts will vanish
under the submersion. the torsion will still be tensorial though.

4.1 the vidal connection

in this subsection, all tensors associated with the vidal connection will be de-
rived, that is the torsion tensor, the non-metricity tensor, the riemann tensor
and its traces. the curvature identities are used to express all components but
the two totally semi-basic ones only in terms of the dierent irreducible parts
of the deformation tensor and its derivatives. from these curvature identities
there also arise a couple of new relations involving only parts of the deforma-
tion tensor. two of these will evidently become the bianchi identity of the two
twisting tensors but two others will appear in a more unfamiliar fashion.

from the denition it is clear that the vidal connection is neither torsion-
free, nor metric in the generic case of an almost product manifold. it is therefor
interesting to see what the torsion and non-metricity tensor look like in this
case. in ref. [1] the following proposition was derived.

proposition 4.4
let the triplet (m , g, i) dene an almost product manifold, let ni denote the
nijenhuis tensor of i and  denote the vidal connection dened in 3.18, then,

ni (x, y ) = t (x, y ).

1
4

together with proposition 3.14 the torsion tensor can be written in component
form.

proposition 4.5
let t be the torsion tensor of the vidal connection, , then in component form
it reads

c =0,

c =0,

c

=0,

t ab
t ab
t ab
t ab
t ab
t ab

c

=  2lab

c

,

c =  2l

ab

c,

c

=0.

and

t a =0,
t a =0.

16

as was seen in [1] the torsion tensor measures the non-integrability of the two
complementary distributions dened by an almost product structure. the non-
metricity of the vidal connection is put in the next proposition.

proposition 4.6
let the triple (m , g, i) denote a riemannian almost product structure with
associated metrical decomposition g = g + g. let further  denote the vidal-
connection then the following relations hold

( zg)(x, y ) = 0
( z  g)(x, y ) = 2kz (x, y ) = (lz g)(x, y )
( z g)(x , y ) = 2k 
( z  g)(x , y ) = 0

z(x , y ) = (lz g)(x , y )

in component form the non-metricity tensor can be read o from the next
proposition.

proposition 4.7
let q be the non-metricity tensor of the vidal connection, , then in component
form it reads

abc

=  2kbca

bca

=0

abc
abc =0

q

q
a =0

q
a =0
q

q
a := q

a = 2a

the basic curvature relations are found from denitions 1 and 4.3, they are
given in the proposition below,

17

proposition 4.8
let  be the vidal connection and r denote the curvature tensor theorof then
the dierent parts reads

r(x, y )z = rd(x, y )z  2p[l(x, y ), z]
r(x, y )z  = 2( z  l)(x, y )
r(x, y )z = px p[y , z]  p[y , px z]  pp[x,y ]z  p[p [x, y ], z]

in order to deal with the curvature identities it is convenient to put these rela-
tions in component form.

proposition 4.9
let r be the riemann-tensor with respect to the vidal-connection, then r has
the following components,

d =rd

this is the raw expressions for the curvature components of the vidal con-
nection, but after using the identities of the riemann tensor seen in section 2.4
these will simplify remarkably. there will also appear a couple of identities in-
volving only parts of the deformation tensor. starting with the second identity
it can be seen, using the tic-tac-toe notation introduced in appendix a, that
the second identity can be split according to the rigging into 8 irreducible parts,

18

corresponding to the following young tableaux.

here will be listed only the rst half of the identities as they of course are

so in conclusion the rst identity is structurally inherited by the totally semi-
basic part of the vidal curvature, the second leads to a bianchi identity for
the twisting tensor, the third relating the anti-symmetric part of rc[ab]
d in
terms of the twisting tensors and the fourth a faster way of deriving the rabc
d
component. thus, the following proposition is proved:

proposition 4.10
let  be the vidal connection associated with a almost product structure and
l, l be the respective twisting tensors of the associated distributions then the
following bianchi identities hold,

[albc]
[a l

bc]

d

=0

d =0

the third identity which is decomposed as,



o

=(cid:18) o
(cid:18) o
(cid:18) x

 o o (cid:19) (cid:18) o

 x x (cid:19) (cid:18) x

x

x

 o x (cid:19) 
 o o (cid:19) 
 x x (cid:19)

in this case there are 9 irreducible parts of which ve will be listed and the

19

other follows due to symmetry.

rab(cd) = ( bk)cda

rab(cd) = 2( [ak )cd|b]

the rst identity here gives no new information, the second gives yet another
part of the rabcd component, the third and the fth contain nothing while the
fourth together with the original expression for the rabcd component gives a
new non-trivial identity which proves the next proposition.

proposition 4.11
let  be the vidal-connection, k, l, k , l be the second fundamental tensors
of a almost product structure then we have the following identities

[zk 
[z  kw ](x, y ) + (x l

w ](x , y ) + (x ly )(z, w ) = 0
y )(z , w ) = 0

in component form the same expressions read

( [ak )cd|b] + ( (cl)ab|d) =0
( [a k)cd|b] + ( (cl)ab|d) =0

contracted the identities read

( [a)b] + ( c l)ab
( [a )b] + ( cl)ab

c =0

c

=0

here the notation

lx (y, z) := g(l(y, z), x )

is used. the last identity of the riemann curvature is the most non-trivial of
them all. it can be decomposed through the box symmetry, i.e.

= o o
o o

 o o
o x

 o o
x x

 o x
o x

 x x
x o

 x x
x x

.

the only identity of these which gives new information is the second why it is
the only one listed. this identity though gives the opportunity of writning the
entire rabcd component purely in terms of the dierent parts of the deformation
tensor and its derivatives.

rabcd = ( bk)cda  2( [ck)d]ba + 2lcd

e

l

aeb  4lb[c

(12)

this relation together with the identity in 4.11 prooves the following proposition
which is the nal form of the vidal curvature components.

20

proposition 4.12
let r be the curvature tensor of the vidal connection then its components can
be written

from the nal expressions of the vidal curvature components the schouten two-
form and the ricci tensor can be derived. for the schouten two-form it is easily
seen that it ends up as a total exterior derivative of the two mean curvatures by
looking at the trace of the curvature two-form in the cartan formalism, namely,

v := rc

c = dc

c = d + d.

(13)

now of course  is only a local object, and therefor it is not sure that v can be
written as an exact form globally - this leaves us with the following proposition:

proposition 4.13
let  be the vidal connection then the schouten two-form, v , of the vidal
connection can locally be written

where i =  + . from the integrability condition dv = 0 it is obvious that

v = di

v  h 2(m ),

where h 2(m ) denotes the second cohomology group of the manifold m . in
component form the schouten two-form looks like
v ab =2( [a)b]  2lab
v ab =( a )b  ( b)a ,
v ab =2( [a)b]  2lab

c

now nally the ricci tensor and the curvature scalar of the vidal connection
can easily be derived.

4.2 the adapted connection

in direct analogy to the previous section, several curvature- and torsion relations
are derived with respect to the adapted connection. in contrast to the vidal-
connection the adapted one is metric. in this case the nijenhuis-tensor is related
to the torsion in the way showed by the next proposition. the metricity of the
connection has its price though, as is seen below the torsion tensor is more
complicated in this case. some generalized bianchi identities for the twisting
tensor l is also yielded in this case. all tensors, except the totally semi-basic
ones, derived from the riemann tensor, are expressed in terms of the irreducible
parts of the deformation tensor.

proposition 4.15
let the triplet (m , g, i) dene an riemannian almost product structure, let ni
denote the nijenhuis tensor of i and  the adapted connection dened in 3.17,
then we have the following relation,

ni (x, y ) = t (x, y ) + t (ix, iy )

1

proposition 4.16

the curvature components can further be simplied as shown in the next propo-

from previous proposition the ricci tensor of the adpted connection can simply

the generalized biachi-identities for the twisting tensor l are given in next
proposition. they were derived by using the antisymmetry ((i) of proposition
2.4) and the components expressed in terms of the adapted connection, see
proposition 4.19.

as was seen in previous subsection, where the vidal connection was studied,
new identities between parts of the deformation tensors arose as integrability
conditions on these while imposing the identities of the curvature tensor. these
were derived in proposition 4.19 above and in the same fashion the corresponding
identities for the adapted connection arise.

proposition 4.22
let  be the adapted connection, k, l, k , l be the second fundamental tensors
with respect to a almost product structure, i, then the following identities hold

4.3 the levi-civita connection

in this section all curvature relations for the levi-civita connection is given.

ducible components of the deformation-tensor. starting from cartans structure
equations and writing the curvature two-form as,

these are also known as the gauss-codazzi relations. in the case of the levi
civita connection though, it is clear that its curvature tensor possesses the box
symmetry, i.e.

from the tictactoe notation it follows that the box symmetry reduces to
six irreducible parts under a rigging. from the previous analysis of the vidal
and the adapted curvatures these can again be written entirely in terms of the
semi-basic components and parts of the deformation tensors.

proposition 4.24
let r be the riemann tensor with respect to the levicivita connection then its
components can be written in terms of just the deformation tensor and adapted
covariant derivatives thereof plus the complete longitudal and normal parts of

in ref. [5] these were deduced in terms of the levicivita connection but as it
does not preserve the rigging these are better expressed in terms of the adapted
or the vidal connection. note that the expressions are only decomposed in
terms of the irreducible parts of the deformation tensors, where it is necessary
in order to make manifest the symmetries. in all other cases it is a straight
forward process to do just by insertion.

proposition 4.25
let r be the riemann tensor with respect to the levicivita connection then
its components can be written in terms of just the deformation tensor and vidal
covariant derivatives thereof plus the complete longitudal and normal parts of
the vidal curvature as

4.4 their conformal properties

in an earlier treatment it was found that conformal transformations does aect
a connection including torsion and non-metricity in a non-trivial fashion. here
will be given a complete analysis of the induced transformations of the vidal,
adapted and levicivita connections.

denition 4.28
let the triplet (m , g, i) denote an almost product manifold, let , ,  de-
note the levicivita, adapted and vidal connection respectively then dene
the associated conformal tensors denoted c , c ,

c with characteristics

by

c , c ,

c :

1  1 7 1

c (x, y ) :=cx y  x y
c (x, y ) :=cx y  x y
c (x, y ) :=cx y  x y

where x, y  l1 are vectorelds on m .

the conformal tensor, corresponding to the vidal and the adapted connection,
can most easily be expressed in terms of the conformal tensor of the levicivita
connection.

proposition 4.29
let c , c ,
hold

c be the conformal tensors dened in 4.28 then following relations

c (x, y ) = x[]y + y []x  g(x, y )d
c (x, y ) = p c (x, py ) + p c (x, p y )
c (x, y ) = p c (px, py ) + p c (p x, p y )

where x, y  1 are vectorelds on m .

proof: to be added.

(cid:4)

the dierence between these conformal tensors manifests itself in a clearer way
by studying the expressions in component form. the conformal tensor of the
levicivita connection is read of from the above proposition and is noticeably
symmetric.

proposition 4.30
let c be the conformal tensor of the levicivita connection then in component

the conformal tensor of the adapted connection can now be derived from the
above expressions. it should be stressed though that it is not symmetric.

well known is the fact that when decomposing the riemann curvature tensor of
the levicivita connection into its irreducible parts with respect to its traces,
the appearing weyl tensors measures whether the riemannian manifold is con-
formally at or not. more specically, the vanishing of the weyl tensor is the
condition for local conformal atness in the case when the dimension of the
manifold exceeds three. the tracefree part of the ricci tensor is dened by,

rab := rab

(16)

next the ricci one-form and the tracefree ricci one-form are dened.

from above proposition it is for instance clear that the rabc
the riemann tensor must be conformally invariant. taking a look at its -
nal expression in proposition 4.24 the only non-manifest conformally invariant
terms, are those involving derivatives. these can be proved to be independently
conformally invariant.

or put in component form

(c[cl)ab|d] =e2( [cl)ab|d]

ponents of the adapted connection can be divided into irreducible parts - in
the case of an almost product manifold instead as for just an embedding, some

immediate dierences is noticed. the generalisation of what carter calls the
outer curvature is the rab
component which will be seen not to be con-
formally invariant in the generic case but only if the unprimed distribution is
integrable. the same is of course true for the outer curvature of the comple-
mentary (primed) distribution. from proposition 4.19 it is manifest that the
non-invariant components are

respectively. for the internal curvature which in the language of almost product
manifolds is the total semi-basic components of the adapted curvature, one can
follow the procedure of dividing the tensor components into its irreducible parts
according to the above scheme. in the generic case the semi-basic components
does not have the box symmetry

. because of torsion though, it has the other symmetry parts. it is clear that
when the distribution is integrable its internal curvature will indeed have the
box symmetry. dening the internal weyl tensors the generalization of [8, 9]
can be made.

from this proposition it follows that if the semi-basic part of the conformal
tensor is zero and the distribution is integrable then the distribution possess
local conformal atness if and only if its conformation tensor vanishes. of
course this is only true in the case where k > 3. this generalizes carters result
to the case of almost product manifold.

5 physical applications

there are lots of physical applications involving almost product manifolds. be-
cause principal bundles can be regarded as a almost product manifold with
the (gf, gd) structure ordinary gauge theory can be found in its utmost geo-
metrical form. in kaluzaklein theory the internal space need not be a group
manifold but could instead be a homogenous space with the proper gauge group
as its isometry group. here will be given an example of the recovered kaluza
klein theory from the almost product structure taken rst in the most general
case where no restriction of the ber is made.

example 5.1

36

kaluza-klein theory
here will be seen how, in the case of a (gf, gd) structure, the vidal connection
will reduce to the gauge covariant derivative. the einsteinhilbert action will
reduce to the inner curvatures plus the gauge eld term as in [10]. first note
the spliting of the action in the (gf, gd) case,

z dmxpgr = z dkxdk

ygpg( r + r + l2).

(18)

note that the primed distribution is chosen to be integrable. following [10] the
vielbeins can locally be parametrized as

e a =ea + ai
e a =e a,

aki,

e a = ea

manifold. these satisfy an algebra

where the structure constants fij

k of the isometry group and does not depend
iaj  ak is most easily found [1]
(20)

f (x, y ) = p [x, y ] = 2l(x, y )

where x, y are unprimed vector elds which implies that the l2 term in the

action reads 1
vidal connection of the gauge eld can be written

( x f )(y, z) = (

d

written in component form, the relations look like,

( af )i

bc = (

(22)

which is precisely the gauge covariant derivative. further the identity from

the rab term from proposition 4.27 reduces to

a

motion for the gauge eld, i.e. ( cf )i

which from the einsteins equations point of view reduces to the equations of
c = 0. so it is clear that gauge theory and
kaluza-klein theory is contained in the almost product manifold description.
in the general case however the killing vectors could be exchanged to ordinary
vielbeins, the structure coecients need not be constant and the ber no longer
a group space or homogenous space, the almost product structure procedure
would still be valid. in the case of kaluza-klein theory containing the dilaton
eld it is easy to see that it is contained in the mean curvature, , see [1].

37

another more traditional example is the decomposition of the four dimensional
curvature scalar into three space in hamiltonian formulation of ordinary ein-
stein gravity. from proposition 4.26 the decomposition of the curvature scalar
is immediately found to be r = r  2 + k 2. from a foliation point of view it
is clear that a space with non-degenerate metric of minkowskian signature must
have vanishing euler number which is also the condition for a space to have a
codimension one foliation [11, 12]. this is why the l2 term can be set to zero.

6 conclusions and outlook

the theory of almost product manifolds is seen to overlap with a lot of physical
applications. the main areas is of course geometrical phyics such as gravity,
kaluza-klein theory and ordinary gauge theory. here was seen for instance
that in gauge- or kaluza-klein theory the vidal connection reduces to the ordi-
nary gauge covariant derivative and the second curvature identity of the vidal
curvature gives the bianchi identity of the gauge eld. the relations found
propositions 4.26 and 4.27 could perhaps be used to nd new solutions to the
equations of motions of various supergravity theories. here the the ricci tensors
are given in the most general case why all kind of brane solutions must t in this
scheme. from these relations it should also be clear that a black hole solution in
ordinary space-time carrying a gauge eld charge should correspond to a black
hole solution in the total space with rotational parameters corresponding to the
gauge charges. the reason for this is of course the identication of the twist-
ing tensor as the gauge eldstrength. in super gravity theories the black hole
solutions carry charges from anti-symmetric tensor elds and will be p-brane so-
lutions. these can again have rotational parameters in the transverse directions
which correspond to gauge eld charges of the isometry group of the transverse
space [3, 13] which by analysis in [1] would correspond to a non-integrability of
the brane itself in this context.

another interesting investigation would be to see how the cliord algebra
splits in a almost product manifold. in a appearing paper [14] will be shown
how at super space looks in the almost product structure picture.

a tictactoe notation

the tic-tac-toe notation can most easily be described by working through the
rst non-trivial young tableau, which is the (2,1) one.

above the tic-tac-toe notation was used where the os labels unprimed degrees
of freedom and the xs primed ones. the tic-tac-toe tableaux works exactly

38

as an ordinary young-tableau. since the primed and the unprimed directions
does not talk with each other when it comes to symmetries, the dimension of
a tic-tac-toe tableau equals the product of the dimensions of the pure primed
and unprimed sub-tableaux respectively. their respective dimensions read

m(m2  1)
