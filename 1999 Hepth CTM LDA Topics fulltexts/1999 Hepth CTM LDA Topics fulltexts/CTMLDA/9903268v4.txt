abstract

i describe1our understanding of physics near the planck length, in particular the
great progress of the last four years in string theory. superstring theory, and a recent
extension called m theory, are leading candidates for a quantum theory that unies
gravity with the other forces. as such, they are certainly not ordinary quantum
eld theories. however, recent duality conjectures suggest that a more complete
denition of these theories can be provided by the large n limits of suitably chosen
u (n ) gauge theories associated to the asymptotic boundary of spacetime.

1 introduction

philosophically, one of the main achievement of quantum elds theory is to have
constructed (in the transcendental sense) the third dynamical category of interac-
tion2, weyls gauge principle converting gauge invariances into dynamical principles.
according to quantum eld theories the constitutive principles (relativity, symme-
try) provides lagrangians, which in turn provide feynmans integrals, wich provide
themselves the models.
gauges theories have shown that if we localisze the internal symmetries and if we
impose the invariance of the lagrangians for these supplementary symmetries, we
can reconstruct in a purely mathematical manner the interacions lagrangians. the
mathematical constraints are so strong (renormalizability, elimination of anomalies,

string theory. it is an introductory one.

2 general relativity constructed the second dynamical category of causality i.e. the force. indeed,
in general relativity, the metric is no longer an a priori component but on the contrary a physical
phenomenon which has to be determined. it is for this reason that metric can absorb the forces. so we
have a conversion of the kinematical moment concerning metric into the dynamical moment concerning
forces, a shifts from the metrical and global level to the local and dierentiable one.

higgs mechanism of symmetry breaking for confering a mass to the gauge bosons,
etc.) that it is possible to infer from very few empirical data to the choice of a
symmetry group. in superstring theory this fact is even more evident.

in addition, as we all know, quantum eld theory has been extremely successful
in providing a description of elementary particles and their interactions. however,
it does not work so well for gravity. if we naively try to quantize general relativity
(which is a classical eld theory) using the methods of quantum eld theory, we run
into divergences which cannot be removed by using the conventional renormaliza-
tion techniques of quantum eld theory. string theory is an attempt to solve this
problem[1].

2 a review of perturbative string theory

the basic idea in string theory is quite simple. according to string theory, dierent
elementary particles, instead of being point like objects, are dierent vibrational
modes of a string. fig.1 shows some of the oscillation modes of closed strings and
open strings.

figure 1: some vibrational modes of closed and open strings

the energy per unit length of the string, known as string tension, is parametrized
as (2)1, where  has the dimension of (length)2. this theory automatically
contains gravitational interaction between elmentary particles, but in order to cor-
rectly reproduce the strength of this interaction, we need to choose  to be of
the order of 1033cm. since  is the only length parameter in the theory, the
typical size of a string is of the order of   1033cm  a distance that cannot be

resolved by present day experiments. thus there is no direct way of testing string
theory, and its appeal lies in its theoretical consistency.

2

the basic principle behind constructing a quantum theory of relativistic string
is quite simple. consider propagation of a string from a space-time conguration
a to a space-time conguration b. during this motion the string sweeps out a two
dimensional surface in space-time, known as the string world-sheet (see fig.2). the

a

amplitude for the propagation of the string from the space-time position a to space-
time position b is given by the weighted sum over all world-sheet bounded by the
initial and the nal locations of the string. the weight factor is given by es where
s is the product of the string tension and the area of the world-sheet. let  be a
parametrization of the string. if  is its proper time, the parametrization of its world
leaf is x(,  ) endowed with the metric gab = g ax bx (a, b = or ). this
leads to the introduction of new lagrangians, for instance the polyakov lagrangian:

l = ggabax bx 

(2.1)

with g =| det(gab) |. one has to compute functionnal integrals of the following

type:

z = xtopologies

zmetrics

dx esp(i

)

(2.2)

it turns out that this procedure by itself does not give rise to a fully consistent
string theory. in order to get a fully consistent string theory we need to add some
internal fermionic degrees of freedom to the string and generalize the notion of area
by adding new terms involving these fermionic degrees of freedom. this leads to ve
(apparently) dierent consistent string theories in (9+1) dimensional space-time.

in the rst quantized formalism, the dynamics of a point particle is described by
quantum mechanics. generalizing this we see that the rst quantized description
of a string will involve a (1+1) dimensional quantum eld theory. however unlike a
conventional quantum eld theory where the spatial directions have innite extent,
here the spatial direction, which labels the coordinate on the string, has nite extent.
it represents a compact circle if the string is closed (fig.3(a)) and a nite line interval
if the string is open (fig.3(b)).

this (1+1) dimensional eld theory is known as the world-sheet theory. the
elds in this (1+1) dimensional quantum eld theory and the boundary conditions
on these elds vary in dierent string theories. since the spatial direction of the
world-sheet theory has nite extent, each world-sheet eld can be regarded as a
collection of innite number of harmonic oscillators labelled by the quantized mo-
mentum along this spatial direction. dierent states of the string are obtained by
acting on the fock vacuum by these oscillators. this gives an innite tower of
states. typically each string theory contains a set of massless states and an innite
tower of massive states. the massive string states typically have mass of the order
of (1033cm)1  1019gev and are far beyond the reach of the present day accel-
erators. thus the interesting part of the theory is the one involving the massless
states. we shall now briey describe the interaction in various string theories and
their compactications.

2.1

interactions

to describe the theory we must also describe the interaction between various par-
ticles in the spectrum (in string theories).
in particular, we would like to know
how to compute a scattering amplitude involving various string states. it turns out
that there is a unique way of introducing interaction in string theory. consider for
example a scattering involving four external strings, situated along some specic
curves in space-time. the prescription for computing the scattering amplitude is to
compute the weighted sum over all possible string world-sheet bounded by the four
strings with weight factor es, s being the string tension multiplied by the gener-
alized area of this surface (taking into account the fermionic degrees of freedom of
the world-sheet). one such surface is shown in fig.4.

if we imagine the time axis running from left to right, then this diagram repre-
sents two strings joining into one string and then splitting into two strings,  the
analog of a tree diagram in eld theory. a more complicated surface is shown in

4

figure 4: a string world-sheet bounded by four external strings.

fig.5. this represents two strings joining into one string, which then splits into

figure 5: a more complicated string world-sheet.

two and joins again, and nally splits into two strings. this is the analog of a one
loop diagram in eld theory. the relative normalization between the contributions
from these two diagrams is not determined by any consistency requirement. this
introduces an arbitrary parameter in string theory, known as the string coupling
constant. however, once the relative normalization between these two diagrams is

5

xed, the relative normalization between all other diagrams is xed due to various
consistency requirement. thus besides the dimensionful parameter , string theory
has a single dimensionless coupling constant.

so feynmans interaction graphs are substituted by riemann surfaces (which are
topological congurations of interactions). for doing that, we need riemann sur-
faces theory. for exemple we need teichmuler theory of moduli spaces for knowning
exactly what are the automorphismes of a riemann surface (what are its dieomor-
phismes which are not isotopic to the identity, what are the complex structures
compatible with a given dierentiable structure, etc.). we need also the solution
of the schottky problem. let s be a riemann surface of genus g. it is well known
that it is possible to nd a basis (ai, bi), i = 1, ..., g of the homology of s and a
basis (i), j = 1, ..., g of the space of dierentiable 1formes which are the simplest
possible, that is to say which satisfy:

and

i = ij

j = ij

(2.3)

(2.4)

the matrix  = (ij) of periods being symmetric and of imaginary part positive
denite: im > 0. but if g > 3, the space of the matrices  which are symmetric
and of imaginary part > 0 has a dimension 1
2 g(g + 1) which is greater than the
dimension 3g  3 of the moduli space of s. therefore we must characterize the
 which can be the period matrices of riemann surfaces. this is the schottky
problem. it has been solved only in 1984.

2.2 compactication

the ve dierent string theories mentioned above, all live in ten space-time dimen-
sions. since our world is (3+1) dimensional, these are not realistic string theories.
however one can construct string theories in lower dimensions using the idea of com-
pactication. the idea is to take the (9+1) dimensional space-time as the product
of a (9 d) dimensional compact manifold m with euclidean signature and a (d + 1)
dimensional minkowski space rd,1. then, in the limit when the size of the compact
manifold is suciently small so that the present day experiments cannot resolve
this distance, the world will eectively appear to be (d + 1) dimensional. choosing
d = 3 will give us a (3+1) dimensional theory. of course we cannot choose any ar-
bitrary manifold m for this purpose; it must satisfy the equations of motion of the
eective eld theory that comes out of string theory. one also normally considers
only those manifolds which preserve part of the space-time supersymmetry of the
original ten dimensional theory, since this guarantees vanishing of the cosmological
constant, and hence consistency of the corresponding string theory order by order in
perturbation theory. there are many known examples of manifolds satisfying these

6

restrictions e.g. tori of dierent dimensions, k3, calabi-yau manifolds etc. for
instance -using a kaluza-klein device - we can compactify 16 dimensions (starting
from d = 26) using the lattice of the roots of the lie gauge group e8 e8 and then
compactify again 6 dimensions :m 10  m 4  k 6. physical constraints of preser-
vation of supersymmetry impose for exemple that there exists on k a spinor eld
 which is constant for the covariant derivation (i.e. di = 0).this fact imposes
drastic constraints upon the geometry of k 6: the ricci cruvature must be = 0, the
holonomy group must be = su (3), the rst chern class c1(k) of k must be = 0,
there must be exist a kahler metric on k, etc. ( in fact, according to a celebrated
theorem of calabi and yau, a kahler manifold k 2n with c1(k) = 0 admits neces-
sarily a kahler metric with holonomy group su (n) (and not o(2n))).
instead of going via the eective action, one can also directly describe these com-
pactied theories as string theories. for this one needs to modify the string world-
sheet action in such a way that it describes string propagation in the new manifold
m  rd,1, instead of in at ten dimensional space-time. this modies the world-
sheet theory to an interacting non-linear -model instead of a free eld theory.
consistency of string theory puts restriction on the kind of manifold on which the
string can propagate. at the end both approaches yield identical results.

the eect of this compactication is to periodically identify some of the bosonic
elds in the string world-sheet eld theory  the elds which represent coordinates
tangential to the compact circles. one eect of this is that the momentum carried
by any string state along any of these circles is quantized in units of 1/r where r
is the radius of the circle. but that is another novel eect: we now have new states
that correspond to strings wrapped around a compact circle. for such a states, as
we go once around the string, we also go once around the compact circle. these
states are known as winding states and play a crucial role in the analysis of duality
symmetries.

dimensional if the radius is very small.

it turns out that there are many dierent choices for this six dimensional com-
pact manifold (case d = 3). thus each of the ve string theories in (9+1) dimensions
gives rise to many possible string theories in (3+1) dimensions after compactica-
tion. some of these theories come tantalizingly close to the observed universe. in
particular one can construct models with:

i) gauge group containing the standard model gauge group su (3)  su (2) 

u (1),

ii) chiral fermions representing three generations of quarks and leptons,

iii) n=1 supersymmetry,

iv) gravity.

furthermore unlike conventional quantum eld theories which are ultraviolet di-
vergent but renormalizable, and quantum general relativity which is ultraviolet di-
vergent and not renormalizable, string theories have no ultraviolet divergence at
all!

3 unication

the motivation for supersymmetry comes from the idea of gauge unication. recent
experiments have yielded precise determinations of the strengths of the su (3) 
su (2)  u (1) gauges interacitons - the analogs of the structure constant for these
interactions. in quantum eld theory theses values depend on the energy at which
they are measured in a way that depends on the particle content of the theory.
using the measured values of the coupling constants and the particle content of the
standard model, one can extrapolate to higher energies and datermine the coupling
constants there. the result is that the three coupling constants do not meet at
the same point. however, repeating this extrapolation with the particles belonging
to the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model, the three gauge
coupling constants meet at a point as sketched in g.7.

3.1 supersymmetry

supersymetry is a symmetry that relates bosons to fermions, though every fermion
has a bosonic superpartner and vice versa. for exemple, fermionic quarks are part-
ners of bosonic squarks. by this we mean that quarks and squarks belong to the
same irreductible repesentation of the supersymmetry, if supersymmetry were an
broken symmetry, particles and their superpartners would have exactly the same
masse. so it is inherently quantum mechanical symmetry, since the very concept of
fermions is a quantum mechanical.

3

in quantum led theory boson elds have dimension one and fermion elds have
2 in ordre that the action be dimensioneless (in units  = c = 1). the reason
is that boson elds have two derivatives in their action while fermion elds have

only one.
it is not dicult to see that two supersymmetry transformations will
certainly lead to a gap of one unit of dimension. the only dimensional object
dierent from elds themselves available to ll this gap is the derivative. thus in
any global supersymmetry model we can always nd a derivative appearing in a
double transformation relation, purely on dimensional grounds.
mathematically therefore the global supersymmetry resemble taking the square root
of the transformation operator. so actually it is not an internal symmetry but an
enlargement of the poincare groupe. this amounts to an extension of space-time
to superspace that includes extra spinorial anticommuting coordinates as well as
ordinary coordinates. we do not change the structure of space-time but we add
structure to it. we start with the usual coordinates x  = t, x, y, z and add an odd
dimensions ( = 1, ..., n). these dimensions are fermionic and anticommute

they are quantum dimension that have no classical analog, which makes it dicult
to visualize or to undrstand them intuitively.

more formally, a genral grassmann algebra with n generators gn is dened as

follows:

i) gn is a vector space over the complex numbers
ii) a product is dened over gn, which is associative and bilinear with respect to

addition and multiplication by scalars

iii) gn contains the unit element for this product
iv) gn is generated by n elements a, a = 1, ..., n which obey the relation

ab + ba = 0

(3.6)

9

furthemore, there is no other independent relations among the generators.

it follows from the anticommutaiton of the s that gn is 2n-dimensional as a vector
space. a basis of gn is given by the monomials 1, a, ab(a < b), ...12...n. a
general element g of gn reads

g = g0 + gaa + gabab + ... + ga1a2...ana1...an

(3.7)

where the cocients gab, ..., ga1a2...an can be assumed to be completely antisym-
metric. the coecients g0 is the component of g along unity.
so we can distinguish between even dynamical x  variables (commuting c-numbers)
and odd dynamical variables  (anticommuting c-numbers). where

x (t) = x

0 (t) + x i

(3.9)

a grassman-valued function of the dynamical variables (x , ) is an element
of the grassmann algebra, to which x  and  belong, which depends on x  and
. in termes of components, a function f(x , ) is equivalent to a set of function
f0, fa, fab, ... of the components x

of particular importance are the so-called superfunctions. these depends on the
a, .. only through x  and  and have no ex-

ab, ..., 

0 , x 

individual components x 
plicit dependence on a.

the fact that the odd directions are anticommuting has important consequences.
consider a function of superspace (with  = 4)

f(x, ) = (x) + (x) + ... + 4f (x)

(3.11)

since the square of any  is zero and there are only four dierent s the expansion
in powers of  terminates at the fourth order. therefore, a function of superspace
includes only a nite numbers of functions of x (16 in this case). hence, we can
replace any function of superspace f(x, ) with the component functions (x),
(x).... this include bosons (x) and fermions (x), ...
. this is one way of
understanding the pairing between bosons and fermions.

a supersymmetric theory looks like an ordinary theory with degrees of freedom
and interactions that satisfy certain symmetry requirement. in this sens, supersym-
metry by itself is not a very radical proposal. however, the fact that bosons and
fermions come in pairs in supersymmetric theories had important consequences. in
some loop diagrammes the bosons and fermions cancel each other. this boson-
fermion cancellation is at the heart of most of the applications of supersymmetry.

10

just as for usual symmetries, one can distinguish between two kinds of supersym-
metries: global ones (rigid supersymmetry) and local ones (gauge supersymmetry).
in local theory the translation operator diers from point to point. this is precisely
the notion of a general coordinate transformation and leads us to expect that grav-
indeed, guided by the requirement of local supersymmetry
ity must be present.
invariance and using noethers method, we can actually get massless spin 3
2 eld
gauging supersymmetry, i.e. gravitino and massless spin-2 eld gauging space-time
symmetry, i.e. the graviton. so the local gauge theory of supersymmetry implies a
local gauge theory of gravity. this is the reason for such local supersymmetry being
called supergravity. still that in supergravity and extended supergravity the rela-
tion between supersymmetry and extra internal symmetry is still unclear. so the
relation between external and internal geometries are still vague within the context
of supergravity.

on the other hand in the revitalized kaluza-klein theory, where the number of
extra space dimensions become seven (taking into account the number of symmetry
operations embodied in grand unied theories and extended n=8 supergravity), the
internal symmetries are the manifestations of the geometrical symmetries associated
with the extra compactied space dimensions and that all the kinds of geometries
associated with internal symmetries are genuine space geometries, i.e. geometries
associated with extra space dimensions. so the question concerning the relation
between internal and external geometries, in a deeper sens, remains profound. nev-
ertheless, the modern kaluza-klein theory does open a door for establishing the
correlation between non-gravitational gauge potentials and the geometrical srtuc-
tures in four dimensional space-time via the geometrical structures in extra dimen-
sions. within this theoretical context the unications of gravity and other gauge
interactions, is in principle testable, and cannot be accused of being irrelevant to
the future development of fundamental physics.
in superstring the introduction of extra compactied space dimensions is due to
dierent considerations from just reproducing the gauge symmetry. therefore, the
properties and structures of the compacied dimensions are totally dierent from
those in the kaluza-klein version. for example there is no symmetry in the compact
dimensions from which the gauge symmetries emerge. the gauge interactions are
correlated with the geometrical structure of ten-dimensional space-time as a whole
and not with the extra dimensions. more, in ten-dimensional quantum superstring
theories there are gravitational and yang-mills anomalies, that is the violation of
the conservation of the yang-mills charges and the energy-momentum. requiring
the absence of all anomalies leads to requiring a very intimate relationship between
gravitational and yang-mills interactions.

11

3.2 supersymmetry and strong coupling

supersymmetry gives new information about strong coupling. to see this (we follow
polchinski [30]), let us consider in quantum theory the hamiltonian operator h, the
simplest example is the hamiltonian:

h = waa+a + wbb+b

where we have bosonic and fermionic harmonic operators that obey:

[a, a+] = [b, b+] = 1

the supersymmetric operator q is dened as :

q  b+a + a+b

(3.12)

(3.13)

(3.14)

if a+ | 0i is a one boson state, then qa+ | 0i becomes a one fermion state, and vice
versa q obeys the following identity

[q, h] = (wa  wb)q

(3.15)

if wa = wb = w, then the supersymmetric operator q commutes with the hamilto-
nian and:

{q, q+} =

2
w

h

(3.16)

these identities show that q and q+ form a closed algebra with the hamiltonian if
the fermions and bosons have equal energy.

take in addition the charge operator g3 associated with an ordinary symmetry
like electric charge or baryon number. the fact that g is a symmetry means that
it commutes with the hamiltonian,

as we have said for supersymmetry one has the same,

[h, g] = 0 .

but there is an additional relation

[h, q] = 0 ,

q2 = h + g ,

(3.17)

(3.18)

(3.19)

in which the hamiltonian and ordinary symmetries appear on the right. it is this
equation that gives the extra information. consider now a state |i which is neutral
under supersymmetry:
(3.20)

q|i = 0 .

3there are usually several gs and several qs, so that there should be additional indices and constants

in these equations.

12

we are interested in states that are neutral under at least one q but usually not all
of them. these are known as bps (bogomolnyiprasadsommereld) states. the
expectation value of the relation (3.19) in this state gives us:

h|q2|i = h|h|i + h|g|i .

(3.21)

the left side vanishes by the bps property, while the two terms on the right are
the energy e of the state |i and its charge q under the operator g. thus

e = q ,

(3.22)

and so the energy of the state is determined in terms of its charge.so a dynamical
quantity is determined entirely by symmetry information.

since the calculation of e uses only symmetry information, it does not depend
on any coupling being weak. thus we know something about the spectrum at strong
coupling[30]. the bps states are only a small part of the spectrum, but by using
this and similar types of information from supersymmetry, together with general
properties of quantum systems, one can usually recognize a distinctive pattern in
the strongly coupled theory and so deduce the dual theory.

3.3 vacuum selection

another property of many supersymmetric theories that make them tractable is that
they have a family of inequivalent vacua. to understand this fact we should contrast
it with the situation in ferromagnet, which has a continuum of vacua, labeled by the
common orientation of the spins. these vacua are all equivalent, i.e. the physical
observables in one of these vacua are exactly the same as in any other. the reason is
that these vacua are related by a symmetry. the system must choose one of them,
which lerads to spontaneous symmetry breaking. however , in a supersymmetric
theory the zero-point energy of the fermions exactly cancels that of the bosons this
is the source of the presence of some degeneracy. so we see that a supersymmetric
system has a continuous family of vacua. this family, or manifold, is referred to as
a moduli space of vacua.
the analysis of supersymmetric theories is usually simplied by the presence of
these manifolds of vacua, by using he asymptotic behavior along several directions,
where the analysis of the system is simple and various approximation techniques
are applicable, as well as the constraints from holomorphy4, a unique solution is

4the main point is that the supersymmetric quantum eld theories are very constrained. the de-
pendance of some observables on the parameters of the problem is so constrained that there is only one
solution that satises all the consistency conditions. more technically, because of supersymmetry some
observables vary holomorphically with the coupling constants, which are complex numbers in these the-
ories. due to cauchys theorem, such analytic functions are determined in terms of very little data: the
singularities and the asymptotic bahavior. therefore, if supersymmetry requires an observables to depend
holomorphically on the parameters and we know the singularities and the asymptotic behavior, we can
determine the exact answer

13

obtained. so an approximate calculations, which are valid only in some regime,
gives us the exact answer.

4 dualities

few words have been used with more dierent meanings than the word duality.
even within the restricted framework of string theories, duality originally meant a
symmetry between the s and the t-channels in strong interactions (coming from the
demands in the s-matrix approach of the sixties of regge behavior without xed
poles and analiticity, which were shown to imply the existence of an innite number
of resonances) [73]. somewhat related ideas, also termed duality, appear in the
context of conformal field theory (cft) as simple consequences of locality and
associativity of the operator product expansion (ope) [74].

duality symmetry plays an important role in statistical mechanics (for a review
and references to the literature see for instance [75]), in particular in the analy-
sis of the phase diagram of spin systems. it can also be understood as a way to
show the equivalence between two apparently dierent theories. on a lattice system
described by a hamiltonian h(gi) with coupling constants gi the duality transfor-
mation produces a new hamiltonian h (g
i on the dual
lattice. in this way one can often relate the strong coupling regime of h(g) with the
weak coupling regime of h (g). an important application was the determination
of the exact temperature at which the phase transition of the two-dimensional ising
model takes place [76].

i ) with coupling constants g

more recently, the word duality (space-time duality) has been introduced in yet

another sense.

4.1 string duality, m-theory

existence of duality symmetries in string theory started out as a conjecture and still
remains a conjecture. however so many non-trivial tests of these conjectures have
been performed by now that most people in the eld are convinced of the validity
of these conjectures.

a duality conjecture is a statement of equivalence between two or more appar-
ently dierent string theories. two of the most important features of duality are as
follows:

i) often under the duality map, an elementary particle in one theory gets mapped
to a composite particle in a dual theory and vice versa. thus classication
of particles into elementary and composite loses signicance as it depends on
which particular theory we use to describe the system.

ii) often duality relates a weakly coupled string theory to a strongly coupled
string theory and vice versa. in many simple cases the coupling constants g

and eg in the two theories are related via the simple relation:

(4.23)

g =eg1 .

thus a perturbation expansion in g contains information about non-perturbative
eects in the dual theory. in particular the tree level (classical) results in one
theory can contain contribution from perturbative and non-perturbative terms
in the dual theory. this also clearly shows that duality is a property of the
full quantum string theory, and not of its classical limit.

thus there are two aspects of duality

classical  quantum

i) (9+1) dimensional so(32) heterotic and type i string theories are conjectured

to be dual to each other.[3, 4]

ii) so(32) heterotic string theory compactied on a four dimensional torus (de-
noted as t 4) is conjectured to be dual to type iia string theory compactied
on a dierent four dimensional manifold, denoted by k3.[5]

type iib string theories at two dierent couplings g and eg related by eq.(4.23)

are conjectured to describe the same physical theory.[5]

iv) heterotic string theory compactied on a six dimensional torus, denoted by

t 6, is conjectured to be self-dual in the same sense as above.[6, 7]

so due to the fact that a duality conjecture relates two apparently dierent
theories, we see that it gives a unied picture of all string theories. the situation
is summarized in fig.85.

according to this picture the apparently dierent string theories and their com-
pactications are just dierent limits of the same theory, with a large parameter

5 one should keep in mind that this is only a schematic representation.

space.6 there is no universally accepted name for this central theory,  we call it
u -theory. u can be taken to stand for unknown or unied. some small regions of
the parameter space of u -theory, which can be represented by some weakly coupled
string theory, are reasonably well understood and correspond to the weak coupling
regime of the ve dierent string theories and their compactications. but for most
of the parameter space u -theory does not have a description in terms of weakly
coupled string theory. note that in one corner of the parameter space of u -theory,
there is a theory called m -theory [9, 3, 10, 11, 12] which has not been introduced
before. at present not much is known about m -theory except that its low energy
limit is the eleven dimensional supergravity theory, and that various string theories
and their compactications approach m -theory in certain limits. however, unlike
string theory, m -theory does not have any coupling constant, and no systematic
procedure for doing computations in m -theory beyond the low energy supergravity
limit is known.
the m-theory point in the gure is in fact a point of so(10, 1) symmetry: the space-
time symmetry of string theory is larger than had been suspected. the extra piece
is badly spontaneously broken, at weak coupling, and not visible in the perturbation
theory, but it is a property of the exact theory. it is interesting that so(10, 1) is
known to be the largest spacetime symmetry compatible with supersymmetry.

another way to describe this is that in the m-theory limit the theory lives in
eleven spacetime dimensions: a new dimension has appeared. this is one of the
surprising discoveries of the past few years.

4.2 the canonical approach to t-duality

so in string theory and two-dimensional conformal field theory duality is an
important tool to show the equivalence of dierent geometries and/or topologies and
in determining some of the genuinely stringy implications on the structure of the
low energy quantum field theory limit. t-duality symmetry was rst described
on the context of toroidal compactications [81]. for the simplest case of a single
compactied dimension of radius r, the entire physics of the interacting theory is
left unchanged under the replacement r  
/r provided one also transforms the
dilaton eld     log (r/) [82]. this simple case can be generalized to arbi-
trary toroidal compactications described by constant metric gij and antisymmetric
tensor bij [84]. the generalization of duality to this case becomes (g +b)  (g +b)1
and    1
2 log det(g + b). in fact this transformation is an element of an innite
order discrete symmetry group o(d, d; z) for d-dimensional toroidal compactica-
tions [85, 86]. the symmetry was later extended to the case of non-at conformal
backgrounds in [88]. in buschers construction one starts with a manifold m with
metric gij, i, j = 0, . . . d  1, antisymmetric tensor bij and dilaton eld (xi). one
requires the metric to admit at least one continuous abelian isometry leaving invari-

and are expected to be determined dynamically.

b0 = g0/g00,
b = b  (g0b0  g0b0)/g00,

(4.24)

the nal outcome is that for any continuous isometry of the metric which is a
symmetry of the action one obtains the equivalence of two apparently very dierent
non-linear -models. the transformation (4.24) is referred to in the literature as
abelian t-duality due to the abelian character of the isometry of the original -
model.
if n is the maximal number of commuting isometries, one gets a duality
group of the form o(n, n; z) [90]. t-duality symmetries are useful in determining
important properties of the low-energy eective action, in particular in questions
related to supersymmetry breaking and to the lifting of at directions from the
potential [87]. although the transformation (4.24) was originally obtained using
a method apparently not compatible with general covariance, it is not dicult to
modify the construction to eliminate this drawback [91].

of more recent history is the notion of non-abelian t-duality [94, 95, 96, 97],
which has no analogue in statistical mechanics. the basic idea of [94], inspired in
the treatment of abelian t-duality presented in [89], is to consider a conformal eld
theory with a non-abelian symmetry group g.

in the abelian case it is also possible to work out the mapping between some
operators in the original and dual theories, as well as the global topology of the
dual manifold [91]. thus for g abelian we have a rather thorough understanding of
the detailed local and global properties of t-duality. in the non-abelian case global
information can only be extracted for -models with chiral currents [97].

5 the canonical approach

some suggestions have been made in the literature pointing (at least in the simplied
situation where all backgrounds are constant or dependent only on time) towards
an understanding of t-duality as particular instances of canonical transformations
[86, 116].

following [117] we can show that this idea works well when the background
admits an abelian isometry , laying t-duality on a simpler setting , namely as a
(privileged) subgroup of the whole group of (non-anomalous, that is implementable
in quantum field theory [118]) canonical transformations on the phase space of
the theory.

17

so buschers transformation formulae can be derived by performing a given
canonical transformation on the hamiltonian of the initial theory. this is a mini-
mal approach in the sense that no extraneous structure has to be introduced, and all
standard results in the abelian case are easily recovered using it. in particular it is
possible to perform the t-duality transformation in arbitrary coordinates not only
in the original manifold (which was also possible in rocek and verlindes formula-
tion) but also in the dual one. even more, all the generators of the full t-duality
group o(d, d; z) can be described in terms of canonical transformations. this gives
the impression that the t-duality group should be understood in terms of global
symplectic diemorphisms. it would be useful to formulate it in the context of some
analogue of the group of disconnected dieomorphisms, but for the time being such
a construction is lacking.

concerning non-abelian duality, it seems to fall beyond the scope of the hamil-
tonian point of view. there is one example [119] in which the non-abelian dual
has been constructed out of a canonical transformation but it is still early to say
whether the general case can be treated similarly.

5.1 the abelian case

we start with a bosonic sigma model written in arbitrary coordinates on a manifold
m with lagrangian

l =

(gab + bab)()+ab

(5.1)

where x = (  )/2, a, b = 1, . . . , d = dimm . the corresponding hamiltonian is

 a  da/d. we assume moreover that there is a killing vector eld ka,
where 
lkgab = 0 and ikh = dv for some one-form v, where (ikh)ab  kchcab and
h = db locally. this guarantees the existence of a particular system of coordinates,
adapted coordinates, which we denote by xi  (, x), such that ~k = /. we
denote the jacobian matrix by ei
this denes a point transformation in the original lagrangian (5.1) which acts
on the hamiltonian as a canonical transformation with generating function  =
xi()pi, and yields:

a  xi/a.

pa = ei
xi = xi().

once in adapted coordinates we can write the sigma model lagrangian as

(5.5)

in nding the dual with a canonical transformation we can use the routh function
with respect to , i.e. we only apply the legendre transformation to (, ). the
canonical momentum is given by

p = g  + (j+ + j)

this generating functional does not receive any quantum corrections (as explained
in [118]) since it is linear in  and .
if  was not an adapted coordinate to a
continuous isometry, the canonical transformation would generically lead to a non-
local form of the dual hamiltonian. since the lagrangian and hamiltonian in our
case only depend on the time- and space-derivatives of , there are no problems
with non-locality. the transformation (5.10) in (5.7) gives:

from this expression we can read the dual metric and torsion and check that they

for the dual theory to be conformal invariant the dilaton must transform as

the dual manifold m is automatically expressed in coordinates adapted to the
~k = / . we can now perform another point transformation,
dual killing vector
with the same jacobian as (5.3) to express the dual manifold in coordinates which
are as close as possible to the original ones.

the transformations we perform are then: first a point transformation a 
{, x}, to go to adapted coordinates in the original manifold. then a canonical
transformation {, x}  {, x}, which is the true duality transformation. and
nally another point transformation {, x}  a, with the same jacobian as the
rst point transformation, to express the dual manifold in general coordinates.
it turns out that the composition of these three transformations can be expressed
a and the corresponding

in geometrical terms using only the killing vector ka, a  e0

the canonical approach has been very useful in order to obtain the dual manifold
in an arbitrary coordinate system. with the usual approaches it is expressed in
adapted coordinates to the dual isometry. this happens because the dual variables
appear as lagrange multipliers and after an integration by parts only the derivatives
of them emerge, being then adapted coordinates automatically.

7the minus signs in g0 and b0 can be absorbed in a redenition   .

5.2 gauge theories from branes

the study of branes has been useful in deriving gauge theory results from string
theory.[54, 55, 56, 57] this involves.

a p-brane denotes a static conguration which extends along p spatial direc-
tion (the tangential directions) and is localized in all other spatial directions (the
transverse directions). thus the solution is invariant under translation along the p
directions tangential to the brane, as well as the time direction, and approaches the
vacuum conguration as we go away from the brane in any one of the transverse
direction. thus in this language,

0  brane
1  brane
2  brane





particle

string

membrane

etc. typically the quantum dynamics of a conguration of p-branes is described by
a (p + 1) dimensional gauge eld theory,[58, 59] and the coupling constant of this
quantum eld theory is related to the coupling constant of the string theory of which
the brane conguration is a solution. in this case duality symmetries relating strong
and weak coupling limits of the original string theory can be used to derive duality
relations involving the quantum eld theories describing the dynamics of the brane.
this approach has been used to derive many dierent results in supersymmetric
gauge theories. some example are:

i) derivation of montonen-olive duality [60] in n = 4 supersymmetric gauge

theories.[61]

ii) derivation of seiberg-witten like results [62] in n = 2 supersymmetric gauge

theories.[54, 55, 57]

iii) derivation of a special kind of symmetry, known as the mirror symmetry,[63]

in (2+1) dimensional gauge theories.[56]

iv) derivation of seiberg dualities [64] involving n = 1 supersymmetric gauge

theories in (3+1) dimensions.[65, 66]

a special class of p-branes are called dirichlet p-branes (d-branes)9. the name
derives from the boundary conditions assigned to the ends of open strings. more
general, in type ii theories, one can consider an open string boundary conditions at
the end given by  = 0

x 


= 0  = 0, 1, ..., p

x  = x 

0  = p + 1, ..., 9

existence of branes in string theory has also given rise to the possibility that the
standard model gauge elds arise from branes rather than in the bulk of space-time.
this corresponds to novel compactications in which gravity lives in the bulk of the
ten dimensional space-time, but the other observed elds (quarks, leptons, gauge
particles etc.) live on a brane of lower dimension[67].

5.3 maldacena conjecture

a p-brane, or collection of p-branes, gives rise to a certain space-time geometry and
gauge eld conguration, which can be analyzed using the appropriate supergravity
eld equations.
in a number of cases one nds that the geometry has an event
horizon, giving a higher-dimensional analog of black holes. in some of these cases
the geometry near the horizon is approximated by adsp+2  sdp2. this means
that the ads space has p + 2 dimensions and the remainder of the d dimensions
form a sphere of d  p  2 dimensions. there are three basic examples that have
maximal supersymmetry (32 conserved supercharges). a stack of d3 branes in type
iib superstring theory has near horizon geometry ads5  s 5, a stack of m2-branes
in m theory gives ads4 s 7, and a stack of m5-branes in m theory gives ads7 s 4.
let me briey describe some features of anti de sitter space. adsn+1 is a maximally
symmetric spacetime with a negative cosmological constant. it can be described as
a hypersurface in at space by the equation

u2
1 + u2

2  v2

1  v2

2  . . .  v2

n = r2,

(5.17)

where r is called the ads radius. this spacetime has lorentzian signature and
reduces to minkowski spacetime in n + 1 dimensions in the limit r  . just
as an n + 1-dimensional sphere (sn+1) has so(n + 2) symmetry, the symmetry of
this spacetime is so(2, n), a noncompact version of the rotation group in n + 2
dimensions. this contracts to the poincare group (consisting of the lorentz group
so(1, n) and translations) in the r   limit. an intrinsic description of adsn+1
is given by the metric

ds2 =

r2
z2 (dz2 + dxdx),

z > 0,

where

dxdx = dx2

1 + . . . + dx2

n1  dt2.

(5.18)

(5.19)

note that the z = 0 boundary of adsn+1 is an n-dimensional minkowski spacetime,
aside from a divergent factor. what matters is the conformal structure, which is
not sensitive to this divergent factor.

branes. the description od d-branes as a place where open strings can end leads to a simple picture
of their dynamics. for weak string coupling this enables the use of perturbation theory to study non-
perturbative phenomena. one of the most remarkable of these concerns the study of black holes. d-branes
have a very strange property the description of their positions suggest that the space-time coordinates
must be reinterpreted as noncommuting matrices.

23

the so(2, n) isometries of the (n + 1)-dimensional anti de sitter space induce
the group of conformal transformations on its n-dimensional minkowski boundary.
(strictly speaking, the boundary should be compactied by adding a point at in-
nity.) the conformal group is therefore also so(2, n). let me illustrate how this
works with a couple of examples. the so(1, n  1) subgroup of so(2, n) given by
lorentz transformations of the x corresponds to the lorentz group of the bound-
ary. the important point is that these transformations map z = 0 to z = 0,
so that they are well-dened on the boundary. another example is the isometry
x  x, z  z where  is a positive scale factor. this clearly leaves the ads
metric in eq. (5.18) invariant and preserves the boundary. thus the corresponding
conformal transformations of the boundary are scale transformations x  x.
the basic idea of ads/cft duality is to identify a conformally invariant eld
theory (cft) on the n-dimensional boundary with a suitable quantum gravity the-
ory in the (n + 1)-dimensional ads bulk.
the iib theory contains a four-index eld a for which the d3-brane is a source.
it has a eld strength f, which is self-dual (in ten dimensions). in the ads5s 5
solution of the theory, the eld f has a quantized ux on the sphere. schematically,

zs 5

f = n,

(5.20)

where n is a positive integer. this integer determines the radius r of the ads5 and
of the s 5, which are the same. aside from a constant numerical factor, one nds
that

r = (gsn )1/4s.

(5.21)

thus the curvatures (which are proportional to r2) are small compared to the
string scale for gsn  1 and small compared to the planck scale for n  1.
the rst limit suppresses stringy corrections to supergravity, whereas the latter
suppresses quantum corrections to classical string theory.

maldacenas duality conjecture is that type iib superstring theory on ads5 s 5
with n units of f ux is equivalent to n = 4, d = 3 + 1 u (n ) yangmills theory
with g2
y m = gs. for this conjecture to be plausible, it is a crucial fact the n = 4
super yangmills theory [128] is a cft with vanishing beta function, a fact that
was proved in the early 1980s [129]. as should be clear from our presentation,
this conjecture arose from considering the near-horizon geometry of a stack of n
d3-branes, in the limit n  .

6 conclusion

the underlying conception of space-time advocated by string theories is very in-
teresting. yet the conservative side of its conception is also striking:
it takes the
enlarged space-time coordinates themeselves directly as physical degrees of free-
dom that have to be treated dynamically and quantum mechanically. nevertheless,
superstring theory gives an existence proof that gravity can be treated quantum

24

mechanically in a consistent way. more, it has predicted many new physical degrees
of freedom: strings, classical objects such as smooth solitons and singular black
hole, and new types of topological defects such as d-branes. it sheds much light on
eld theory duality and on the gauge-theoretical structure of the standard model.
in eld theory, we now understand that not just connement but the whole range
of surprise of strongly coupled eld theory should be derived from duality, at least
in the supersymmetric case. for string theory the change in viewpoint is perhaps
even wider and includes the discovery that there is only one theory. to understand
the dualities, or the relations between the dierent string theories, we have had to
learn about this new degrees of freedom in string theory, such as d-branes .
