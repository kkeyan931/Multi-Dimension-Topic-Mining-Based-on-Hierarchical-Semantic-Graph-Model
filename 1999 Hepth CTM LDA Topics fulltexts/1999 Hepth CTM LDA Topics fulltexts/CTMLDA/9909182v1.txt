testing stability of m-theory on an s1/z2-orbifold

abstract

we are analyzing perturbatively whether the two-boundary set-up of the horava-
witten proposal for heterotic m-theory leads to a conguration which is stable
with respect to the interactions between the d=10 boundaries, mediated by the
d=11 supergravity bulk elds. therefore we consider perturbations of the graviton,
gravitino and 3-form around a at background which couple to the boundary e8
gauge-multiplet elds giving rise to exchange amplitudes. in leading order of the
d=11 gravitational coupling constant  we nd an expected trivial vanishing of all
three amplitudes and thereby stability of the set-up if the centre-of-mass energy s
of the interaction is zero. this corresponds to the stable bps ground state. for
s > 0, however, which describes an excited conguration, the amplitudes neither
vanish nor cancel each other thus leading to an instability. finally we extrapolate
the interaction amplitudes to the case of coinciding boundaries and compare them
to the ones resulting from the weakly coupled heterotic e8 e8 string theory at low
energies. it turns out that nonperturbative contributions should become relevant
if the duality between heterotic m-theory and the weakly coupled heterotic string
is true and if we can trust horava-witten supergravity at close distance of its
boundaries.

1 introduction and motivation

with the discovery of m-theory on an s1/z2-orbifold [1] and its concrete low-energy
realization as horava-witten supergravity [2], i.e. d=11 supergravity coupled to two
super yang-mills theories with e8 gauge group, living on two separate boundaries of
space-time, the vexing problem of predicting the correct magnitude for the d=4 newton-
constant gn could be addressed anew. while the heterotic string theory predicts a value
for gn which is generically too large by a factor of 400, m-theory on s1/z2 could account
for the correct value by adjusting an additional parameter, the distance d between the two
boundaries, roughly at the inverse of the gut-scale 1016 gev [3]. similar to the weak-
strong coupling relationship between the type iia-string and m-theory, it was found for
m-theory on s1/z2, that g2/3
s = d/, where gs is the heterotic string coupling constant.
since in the limit d  0 of coinciding boundaries the string coupling turns out to be weak,
it is believed that we should recover the usual heterotic string theory with gauge group
e8  e8. thus m-theory on s1/z2 has also been termed heterotic m-theory. since even
more phenomenological virtues of heterotic m-theory were discovered, e.g. it avoids the
problem of small gaugino masses [4], it is an interesting question to ask for its stability 
in particular if the boundary elds have non-vanishing energy.

since the boundaries of the theory maintain an e8 super yang-mills gauge theory,
respectively, a non-vanishing energy-momentum tensor gets induced on each of them.
because gravity couples to any energy-momentum tensor, an interaction between the
boundaries mediated by gravitons in the bulk is inevitable. this interaction should be
attractive, as can be expected from classical gravity. but furthermore the d=11 super-
gravity bulk theory allows for gravitino and 3-form exchanges, which do couple to the
boundary elds as well, due to the underlying supersymmetry. therefore we have to an-
alyze for heterotic m-theory on the proposed [1, 2] r1,9  s1/z2 space-time, whether all
these contributions cancel each other, leading to a stable conguration or not. since it is
not known how to quantize d=11 supergravity consistently, we will restrict ourselves to a
purely classical analysis of the stability problem. remembering the well-known derivation
of the complete coulomb or newton potential from tree-level photon or graviton exchange
diagrams, this should not amount to a severe restriction. noting that the construction of
horava-witten supergravity has been achieved as an expansion in powers of small 2/3,
where  is the d=11 gravitational coupling constant, we are furthermore allowed to ex-
amine the interactions between the two boundaries in linearized gravity to leading order
in  and discard higher order contributions as subleading corrections.

one may be inclined to argue that the situation should be similar to the analogous
case of an interaction between two d-branes of type ii string theory (see [5] for a review).
there the repulsion of the rr-eld compensates exactly the attraction originating from
graviton and dilaton exchange. however, in order to reach that conclusion we have to
avail ourselves of the duality between the closed-string tree-level cylinder amplitude and
the open-string 1-loop annulus diagram. only through the latter is it possible to see the

1

cancellation by appealing to jacobis aequatio identica satis abstrusa. this is in accord
with the common lore that supersymmetry leads to cancellations between fermionic and
bosonic loop-contributions (most prominently applied to the solution of the weak hierarchy
problem). in contrast to the type ii case, heterotic m-theory has been formulated only
as a classical eld theory, so far. therefore we have to deal with genuine tree diagrams
(without any duality to some possibly vanishing loop counterpart), for which, even in a
supersymmetric theory, there is a priori no reason that they add up to zero.

the interaction amplitudes will depend on the parameter d, representing the distance
between the two boundaries in the eleventh direction.
in case that we can still trust
horava-witten supergravity not only for large values of d but also for small values, then
according to the conjecture, the d  0 limit of the above amplitudes should correspond
to the low-energy limit of heterotic string amplitudes. consequently we will derive the
adequate string expressions describing an exchange of d=10 supergravity multiplet elds
in the low-energy limit s, t, u  1 and compare them with our m-theory amplitudes
evaluated at d = 0. if the comparison shows agreement, this would further corroborate
the conjecture. otherwise either horava-witten supergravity is not trustworthy for small
d or one would have to take into account nonperturbative interaction eects between the
boundaries, e.g. mediated by membranes.

the rest of the paper is organized as follows. in section 2 we will apply the background
eld method to horava-witten supergravity with r1,9  s1 chosen as the background2.
after gauge xing the relevant symmetries, we obtain the bulk propagators and determine
the leading order couplings of the boundary elds to the bulk supergravity elds. section
3 continues with the calculation of the amplitudes for graviton, gravitino and 3-form
exchange between the boundaries and a subsequent analysis of the stability of the theory.
in section 4 we derive the d  0 limits of the amplitudes and compare them with their
analogues from low-energy heterotic string theory. section 5 nally ends with a summary
and a conclusion.

2 expansion of horava-witten supergravity around

r1,9  s1 background

as advocated in [1],[2] we should choose r1,9s1 as our d=11 space-time manifold, where
the eleventh coordinate x11 is curled up to a circle which we parameterize by [d, d] with
d  d to be identied. furthermore we have to impose the constraint, that the elds be
invariant under the reection x11  x11. this so-called upstairs formulation, which
we shall employ here, has the advantage that one can work with a smooth manifold,
whereas in the equivalent alternative downstairs formulation one would have to deal
2we are working in the upstairs formulation [2], regarding the theory as an orbifold on r1,9  s 1

with a z2 symmetry imposed on the elds.

with a bounded manifold r1,9  s1/z2 = r1,9  [0, d] and prescribe suitable boundary
conditions. in the latter approach the boundary is given by the two codimension one xed
points of the reection map, situated at x11 = 0 and d.

the construction of horava-witten supergravity starts with the action of n=1, d=11

use i, j, k, l, m, n/a, b, c, d, e, f to represent d=11/d=10 space-time indices and
i, j, k, l, m, n/ a, b, c, d, e, f for their tangent space analogues. moreover we de-
ne  = c, where the real, antisymmetric charge conjugation matrix c obeys

gravitational anomalies arise on the d=10 xed points. the factorizable (trr2)3, trr2trr4
terms can be cured by a green-schwarz-like mechanism whereas the irreducible trr6 part
of the anomaly necessitates the introduction of 496 d=10 vector-supermultiplets for com-
pensation. due to the z2-symmetry they have to be compartmentalized equally to 248
multiplets on each xed point, which singles out the e8 gauge group for the super yang-
mills theories on each boundary. altogether the d=10 boundary action for the e8 vector
supermultiplet3, comprising the gauge eld aa and the gaugino a, coupled to the bulk
supergravity in a locally supersymmetric fashion, reads [2] (i = 1, 2)

actually on the boundary the 4-form eld strength receives an additional contribution
resulting in gabc11 = 4![acbc11]  12
a). but since the second
term does not yield a coupling to the bulk elds, it is irrelevant for our purposes and
will be neglected in the following. furthermore the gauginos possess positive chirality
10a = a. the gauge coupling constant  has been eliminated from (2) by means of
the relation4 2 = 4(42)2/3.
it results from demanding that on the boundary the
non-vanishing gauge variation of the chern-simons term cgg should be cancelled by
the gauge anomaly for the d=10 majorana-weyl gaugino a. though gauge invariance
cannot be established at the classical level, it should be valid at the quantum level, at
least.

from the eld-theoretic point of view, we have to look for small uctuations of the
bulk elds in order to mediate interactions between the boundary elds. this will be
achieved by using the background eld method [8], according to which we split the bulk
elds e m
m , m , cm n p and the quantum
elds f m

m , m , cm n p into a xed classical background e m
m , m , cm n p , which propagate on this background

m = e m

m + f m

e m
m = m + m
cm n p = cm n p + cm n p .

m  gm n = gm n + hm n

the action is then expanded around the background elds into a power series of the
quantum elds. the further multiplication with the d=11 gravitational coupling constant
 has been chosen to give the uctuations ordinary kinetic terms in the action. hence
the expansion in quantum elds is also one in powers of . in the following every index
will be raised or lowered by means of the background elfbein or metric.

4originally, the relation appeared as 2 = 2(42)2/3 in [2]. we employ a further factor of 2, which
was found in [7]. since  will enter our analysis only through an overall factor, which is the same for all
amplitudes, this ambiguity will not have an inuence on our conclusions.

5for at space the curved space-time indices m, n, ... and the tangent space indices m , n , ... coincide

and need not to be distinguished subsequently.

in order not to break spontaneously the d=10 lorentz symmetry, the background grav-
itino eld m as well as the background 3-form cm n p must vanish

m = cm n p = 0 .

as we will point out in the following it is advantageous (though not necessary) if the
background elds fulll the equations of motion as is the case for our at background.
the expansion of the bulk action then proceeds as

+ [quadratic terms for h, , c] + ...(cid:17) .

for our zero-curvature background the leading term vanishes. since the coecients of
h, , c in the 1-term are precisely the variational derivatives of the action with respect
to the classical elds, they will vanish when the background satises the equations of
motion  as in our case. in order to extract the propagators from the quadratic part, we
have, according to the usual faddeev-popov procedure, to x all the gauge symmetries
of the quantum elds and introduce corresponding ghosts. however, since our analysis
is intended to be classical, i.e. at tree-level, we can neglect the ghost elds. n=1, d=11
supergravity possesses four dierent gauge symmetries, which are xed as follows

since the leading 4/3 contribution does not contain any bulk quantum eld it cannot
contribute to the boundary-boundary interaction and is therefore neglected, subsequently
the omitted higher order o(2/3) terms would introduce couplings quadratic in h, , c.
either these would nally lead to loop diagrams of o(4/3) which have to be neglected,
since we restrict ourselves to a tree-level analysis. or in combination with the couplings
linear in h, , c they would give o(1) tree diagrams which are suppressed by a small factor
of 2/3 against the leading diagrams of order o( 1
2/3 ) and therefore also play no role. the

e=1(feacfebd + feadfebc), where fabc are the
e8 structure constants. the 4-vertices are simply proportional to fabc. since nally in
our amplitudes we will sum over all group indices of the external boundary elds (we sum
over all possible exchange amplitudes between the two boundaries), the 5- and 4-vertices
give no contribution due to the antisymmetry of the structure constants. if, therefore, we
concentrate merely on the 3-vertices, the relevant couplings are

3 derivation of the boundary-boundary interaction

amplitudes

in order to incorporate the z2 xed point constraints and to circumvent ambiguities
arising from feynman diagrams involving majorana fermions (which allow for twice as
many wick-contractions as dirac fermions do), we choose not to work with feynman rules
in momentum space directly but to start with a space-time formulation of the s-matrix
on r1,9  s1. for a tree-level boundary-boundary interaction the s-matrix reads

where li,bound represents one of the four couplings li,bbh,li,h,li,b,li,c given in
(8)-(11). from the eleven dimensional perspective the xed point constraints enter via
delta-function sources which generate at p11-spectra in momentum space. momentum is
conserved only along the ten at directions parallel to the boundaries, whereas there is
no such conservation in the eleventh compactied direction transverse to the boundaries.
this fact is also well-known from studies of radiation o d-branes [11], [10]. therefore the
kinematic variables s, t, u of the scattering process are dened through the ten-dimensional
momenta p1, p2 of the incoming states and p3, p4 of the outgoing states as follows

(12)

s = (p1 + p2)2 ,

t = (p1  p3)2 ,

u = (p1  p4)2 .

as usual d=10 energy-momentum conservation implies for massless states s + t + u = 0.
the four 3-vertices (8)-(11) can be combined into ve dierent tree-diagrams which we
will now consider in detail.

here we sum over all colours a, b, c, d and physical polarizations 1, 2, 3, 4 of the
in- and out-states, since all of them add to the interaction of the two boundaries. for
our conventions concerning annihilation and creation operators see the appendix. when
in the next step we wick-contract creation and annihilation operators ba,2 and ba
1 (for
our conventions concerning annihilation and creation operators see appendix b) with the
boundary eld operators ba
ia, we have to take into account that creation and annihilation
operators from the left-hand side of the diagram can only be contracted with left-hand
sided ba
1a(x1) operators and equally creation and annihilation operators from the right-
hand side of the diagram can only be contracted with right-hand sided ba
2a(x2) operators.
if we would allow for mixed contractions, t- and u-channel diagrams would also be
present. but these have to be excluded as they cannot arise when both hyperplanes do
not coincide. after a further trivial integration over the circle coordinates, we are thus

to utilize the previously derived at-space propagator (3), we have to notice that the
momentum in the compactied eleventh direction p11
m = m/r; m  z is quantized. the
radius r of the circle is related via r = d/ to the distance d between the two hyperplanes.
ensuring that we do not change the dimensions of the propagator as compared to the at
case, we have to take

in the following we are dealing separately with the rst and the second term of this
amplitude in order to boil them down to some more enlightening expressions.

lets start with the rst term and the observation that the dirac equation6 p us(p) =

u(p)6 p = 0 causes the relations paabcus(p) = 2p[bc]us(p) and us(p)abcpa = 2us(p)p[bc].

15

us4(p4)(p3  p4)[bc]us3(p3)us2(p2)(p1  p2)[bc]us1(p1) .

by noticing that in the cms-frame p1p2 = (0, ..., 0, e) and p3p4 = (0, ..., 0, e sin , e cos ),
we eventually reduce this expression to

8

4!e2

xs1,s2,s3,s4=1(cid:0) cos us4(p4)9us3(p3)us2(p2)9us1(p1)

= 4!  64s2 .

concerning the second part of the amplitude, we decompose

abc =(cid:18) a b

c d (cid:19)
c d (cid:19) (cid:18) a b

into a 2  2- and a 16  16-matrix. with the explicit expression for the gaugino-spinor
(45), we nd

us4(p4)abcus3(p3) = ec(cid:0)sin

in particular we have for our chosen representation of so(1, 10) -matrices and the 8 8

c = 1, b = 0
c = 1, b = ab,t c

since after summation over the spin-polarizations an antisymmetric matrix b gives a
vanishing contribution, the only non-vanishing terms for our scattering set-up stem from
089 and ijk; i, j, k = 1, ..., 7. hence we are able to reduce the second term to

the rst term describes an alternating sum, which does not converge and requires some
kind of regularization.
in order to understand this contribution, we will explore in a
moment the d   limit. therefore it proofs useful to express the above obtained
amplitude in terms of the d=10 gravitational coupling constant (10) which is independent
of the compactication radius r or d. compactication of m-theory on an s1 of radius
r and a subsequent comparison of its einstein-hilbert term with the einstein-hilbert
term coming from the eective action of the d = 10 heterotic string (in einstein frame)
leads to the following relationship between the d=11 and the d=10 gravitational coupling
constants

since the rst part of the amplitude, consisting of the alternating sum and some d-
independent prefactors, is independent of d, we can equally well evaluate it at any d, in
particular at d  . secondly, if we consider a large radius, the dierence between two
adjacent values of p11
m becomes innitesimally small and we are allowed to replace the sum
by an integral

3.4 two further graviton exchange diagrams

to complete our discussion of all relevant tree diagrams, which contribute to a boundary-
boundary interaction, we also have to consider two further graviton exchange diagrams,
depicted in g.5. both are, after performing the wick-contractions, proportional to

us2(p2)(cid:0)cab  bac(cid:1) us1(p1) + us1(p1)(cid:0)cab  bac(cid:1) us2(p2) ,

which gives zero, if we do avail ourselves of (46). physically the vanishing of the diagrams
is clear, since interchanging the two gauginos of the nal state gives a minus-sign, which
cannot be compensated for by the coupling to a graviton.
in the previously analysed
case of the coupling between two gauginos and the 3-form potential, the coupling delivers
an extra minus-sign under exchange of the two fermions, so that the amplitude did not
vanish in that case.

3.5 analysis of the amplitudes

in the special case of vanishing cms-energy s = 0, each amplitude vanishes separately.
thus in this situation we have trivially no interaction whatsoever between the two bound-
aries. this situation in which there are no excitations on the boundaries should therefore
correspond to a stable bps ground state of the heterotic m-theory set-up. however, if
there are excitations on the boundary, i.e. if we have s > 0, we see that pure gravity
leads to an attraction in the regime sd < , whereas  similar to the behaviour of the
rr-forms in the analogous d-brane case of typeii string theory  the 3-form exchange
leads to a repulsion. if we choose the same cms-energy for all three contributions, then
the attractive gravity dominates the weaker 3-form repulsion. hence the real part of the
amplitudes indicates an instability which is caused by an attractive force trying to bring
the two boundaries closer together. this behaviour is similar to the case of the decay of
an excited d-brane into a massless closed string state and the non-excited d-brane [11].
such a decay is possible whenever the two massless waves on the d-brane run in dierent
directions and accordingly possess s > 0. if the massless waves, however, run in the
same direction (corresponding in our analysis to the s = 0 case), then one is dealing
with a bps state which does not decay.

curiously the gravitino exchange gives rise to an imaginary part. by inspection of
(17) we nd that the forward scattering amplitude t(s,  = 0) is non-vanishing. via the
optical theorem this would signal the opening of some inelastic channels for a decay of
an excited boundary and therefore an instability in a more drastic sense. perhaps it is
possible for consistency reasons in a purely classical treatment of the problem to neglect
the fermionic exchange contribution completely. then this dramatic instability would be
of no concern. finally we want to comment on the singularities of the amplitudes which
arise at s = m 
m ; m  z. at these energies kaluza-klein states are excited which
leads to these pronounced resonances. since the attractive force between the boundaries
becomes innite at these thresholds one could well speculate about a transition to some
stable bounded state conguration. however, this goes beyond the perturbative treatment
given here.

d = p11

a last remark concerns unitarity. if we would evaluate total cross-sections with the
above amplitudes, then by integrating over the appropriate phase space, we would get at
high energies

  |t (s)|2s2  4s5 .

however, unitarity of the s-matrix would lead for spinless states to the following restriction
on partial wave amplitudes

where pj is some polynomial in j independent of s. neglecting -dependent factors which
arise for states with higher spin, we conclude, that the total cross-section  which is the
sum of all j , should decrease with increasing energy in order to obey unitarity. since

19

our cross-sections increase with energy, they violate unitarity. this is also plausible from
the fact, that horava-witten supergravity is not gauge invariant at the classical level and
therefore no ward-identities guarantee unitarity.

4 comparison of the interaction amplitudes with the

weakly coupled heterotic string amplitudes

according to the conjecture made in [1], we should recover the d=10 weakly coupled
heterotic e8  e8 string theory in the limit of small r or d. since the amplitudes which
we have derived, so far, describe the low-energy regime, we should also compare to the
analogous low-energy string amplitudes. here we have to use the expressions (15),(17),(20)
which contain the full angular information. in order to derive the zero radius limit, we
express all the derived amplitudes via (19) through the radius-independent (10) and then

perform the limit sd  0

so far for the m-theory amplitudes. closed string amplitudes involve a factor m2+2l
,
where m is the number of external particles and l the number of loops. hence with four
external particles it is clear, that a factor 2
(10) corresponds to string tree-amplitudes as
well. those heterotic string tree-amplitudes can be found in [12]10. the terms, which
originate there from taking traces of four e8  e8 group generators ti, must be discarded

from our comparison, since they correspond to processes where super yang-mills elds
are exchanged between the initial and nal states. what we want instead to compare
to are the amplitudes which are generated by the exchange of states of the supergravity
multiplet. since they comprise singlet-representations under the e8  e8 gauge group, we
merely encounter terms with traces over two generators, respectively.

the factor g of [12] also contains terms describing a t- and a u-channel exchange. since
in the heterotic m-theory calculation for nite d, we get only s-channel contributions for
interactions of the boundary elds via bulk elds, our expressions for d  0 should only
be compared to this very s-channel part of the string calculation. for this reason we have
omitted the t- and u-contributions to the g-factor. the generator ti corresponds to the
ith external particle and tr is dened as the trace in the adjoint representation of e8  e8
divided by 30. the various i stand for the polarization of the ith particle.
if it is a
spinor, we have to substitute i = usi(pi), whereas for a gauge boson we have to take its
polarization i = i(pi, i).

if we compare these with (22),(24),(25), we recognize substantial dierences. whereas
(22) and (26) deviate mildly in their functional dependence on s, t, u, the discrepancy
between (25) and (28) is manifest. the string amplitude shows an angular dependence
but the heterotic m-theory amplitude is isotropic. the gravitino exchange amplitudes
agree in their angular dependence. nevertheless the string amplitude is real, whereas its
m-theoretic counterpart is purely imaginary.

5 summary and conclusion

our aim in this paper has been to vet whether heterotic m-theory in its concrete low-
energy formulation is stable. therefore we used the background eld method to derive in-
teraction amplitudes between the elds living on the boundaries. each amplitude vanishes
trivially for non-excited boundaries which corresponds to a bps ground state congura-
tion as in the similar d-brane case. nevertheless for an excited boundary the gravitational
attraction dominates the 3-form repulsion, thereby giving rise to a net attractive force
between both boundaries. if one includes also the contribution from a gravitino exchange,
this will produce an imaginary part for the amplitude. an even more drastic instability,
namely the inelastic decay of the boundary would be the consequence. we indicated that
unitarity seems to be violated by the interaction amplitudes, which is also comprehensible
from the fact, that the horava-witten description is classically not gauge invariant. there
are two possible resolutions to these puzzles. our treatment has been purely perturbative
and it may happen that nonperturbative interactions between the boundaries, e.g. by
exchanging membranes, could restore stability. this requires further exploration. on the
other hand one could think of a consistent quantum description of heterotic m-theory. if
extended objects play a fundamental role, a similar stability argument as in the case of
d-branes in typeii string theory via a tree-level  one-loop-level duality is conceivable.

finally, we extrapolated the m-theory amplitudes to the limit in which both bound-
aries coincide. according to the conjecture, this is the realm where we should recover the
e8  e8 heterotic string. however, a comparison with the low-energy heterotic string am-
plitudes showed no complete agreement. there may be two reasons for this discrepancy.
first of all the precise correspondence of a heterotic string interaction would be with a
heterotic m-theory membrane interaction. it has also been our interest in this paper to
see whether this reduces in the eld theory limit merely to a perturbative interaction me-
diated by the bulk supergravity multiplet. one conclusion would be that it does not, but
that nonperturbative eects play an important role. another possible explanation comes
from the observation that usually supergravity gives a good description on large scales.
maybe for d  0, we have pushed it into a region, where horava-witten supergravity
does not apply any longer.

d=10 weyl-spinor: a d=10 weyl spinor obeys the constraint 10(x) = (x). with

where i(x); i = 1, ..., 4 is an 8-component spinor. the dirac-equation aa(x) = 0 for
a weyl-spinor decomposes into two separate equations which read for a positive chirality
spinor

(0  9) 1(x) + aa2(x) = 0
(0 + 9) 2(x) + a,t a1(x) = 0

and for a spinor of negative chirality

(0 + 9) 3(x)  aa4(x) = 0
(0  9) 4(x)  a,t a3(x) = 0 .

changing to momentum space with a positive chirality spinor (x) = eipxu(p), we get

whereas with (x) = eipxv(p) we conclude for a spinor of negative chirality that

(cid:0)p0 + p9(cid:1) u1(p) = apau2(p)
(cid:0)p0  p9(cid:1) u2(p) = +a,t pau1(p) ,
(cid:0)p0  p9(cid:1) v3(p) = apav4(p)
(cid:0)p0 + p9(cid:1) v4(p) = a,t pav3(p) .

of these two equations, respectively, one is equivalent to the other on-shell as can be
demonstrated by using p2 = (p0)2 +(pa)2 +(p9)2 = 0 and the identity (pa)2 = ab,t papb.
hence a d=10 majorana-weyl spinor (x) is determined by only one 8-spinor, say, u1(p).

we now concentrate on majorana-weyl spinors with positive chirality only, since this
is the only relevant case for the problem under study. taking a special 10-momentum, we
