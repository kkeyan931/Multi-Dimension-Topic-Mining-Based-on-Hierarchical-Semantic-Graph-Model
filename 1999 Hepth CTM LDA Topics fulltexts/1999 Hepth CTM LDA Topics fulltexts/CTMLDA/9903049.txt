(3.11) prior computations imply l1 = 4w1. work case case: k = 12, l3 = 0 l2 2w1 + 2w2. gives casimir term bigger 80 implies homogeneity 20. corresponds two-loop correction. k = 11, 2l2 3w1 + 3w2 + w3 + w4 2l3 w1 + w2 + w3 + w4. therefore casimir term bounded by, (4w1, 3w1 + 3w2 + w3 + w4) + 1 2 (17w1 + 13w2 + 7w3 + 3w4, 3w1 + 3w2 + w3 + w4) + 1 2 (w1 + w2 + w3 + w4, 3w1 + 3w2 + w3 + w4) = 66. 11 implies homogeneity 22 h(11) therefore homogeneity 21 corre- sponding part twelve fermion term f (12). assume, physically reasonable, eective action analytic coupling constant term gener- ated two-loops worst. k = 10, l2 w1 + w2 + w3 l3 w1 + w2 + w3 + w4. casimir term bounded (4w1, 2w1 + 2w2 + 2w3) + (8w1 + 6w2 + 4w3 + w4, 2w1 + 2w2 + 2w3) + 2|w1 + w2 + w3|2 = 50. gives homogeneity 25 h(10) 23 corresponding part f (12). potential three-loop term. k = 9, casimir term bounded 25. implies homogeneity 22 corresponding term f (12). again, worst two-loop assuming analyticity coupling constant. k = 8, additional equations, j ass1 xj 2 h(k) = 0. familiar way, extract following relation: (8r r r1(vkj)(r1 + s)(vkj))h(k) 8,s = 0. case, casimir term bounded (r1 + s)(c) + r1(c) s(c) 2r1(c) + 2(r1, s) = 104. gives homogeneity 9 corresponding term f (12), must come unphysical negative power coupling constant. one problematic case k = 10 could generated three loops. show potential three-loop term cannot occur. obtaining three-loop bound, assumed original twelve fermion term pluri-harmonic. pluri-harmonic, would apply least one laplacian get pluri-harmonic term. case, homogeneity bound raised 2 gives two-loop correction, assuming analyticity coupling. 12 let us consider pluri-harmonic, weyl invariant twelve fermion term f (12) . since restricting n = 3 case, two scalar elds cartan label xj yj. expand f (12) form: spherical harmonics sum terms xiyj |x|72|i||y|72|j|. multi-indices j contracted indices appropriate twelve fermion structure. constraint equations imply existence term f (12) 12i form xlym |x|72|l||y|72|m |, |l| = |i| + 12 2i |m | = |j| 12 + 2i. implies |i| 2i 12. three-loop term homogeneity 23 14 + |i| + |j| = 23, |i| + |j| = 9. equality incompatible previous bound |i| > 10. so, need consider imax = 10, 9 8. eliminate possible terms way also used get lower bounds loop corrections. recall f (12) imax weaker equation, killed operators j ass1 xj 1 . "(16 imax)r1 r1 + kj ts t1 s1xk 1 1# f (12) imax xj = 0.

(4.2), nd constraint choice g(r). top forms written form (4.4) natural generalizations superspace notion d-term. useful notion superspace theories sixteen supercharges, still meaningful ask whether term lagrangian necessarily top form written form (4.4). top forms generalized d-terms sense automatically killed qa. searching supersymmetry constraints, want quotient trivial solutions usual cohomological sense. natural dene set generalized f-terms terms cannot written form (4.4).6 since su (2) top forms order eight derivative expansion clearly d-terms, expect supersymmetry impose simple restrictions terms order. however higher rank, fermions generalized f-terms higher orders derivative expansion general eective action compatible sixteen supersymmetries global spin(9) symmetry. strong indication existence terms agreement certain interactions matrix theory supergravity found {$9808061$}. would hope simple argument showing agreement non-renormalization theorems. important open question. conclude discussion showing possible generalized f-terms supersymmetric completion v8 terms n > 3. argument goes follows: choose basis gamma matrices 9 diagonal rest form, (cid:18) 0 0(cid:19) , 8 8 matrix. pi abb contain fermions, 6 wish thank e. witten suggesting denition. 1, . . . , 8, 15 9. suppressing cartan labels moment focusing spin(9) indices. < 9, see pi abb contain fermions, a, 9, . . . , 16. so, example, 1 occur nine choices a. could consider top form, 1a1 1a16, possible rank group sixteen larger. term, appear part spin(9) invariant top form, clearly cannot written generalized d-term form (4.4). nd analogous examples theories lower rank. let us take rank three: sixteen fermion term following fermion content, (1a11a21a3 2a12a2 2a3 5a1 5a25a3 ) 6a3, cannot part generalized d-term. fourteen qa could possibly contribute 1, . . . , 6 fermions need sixteen fermions. hard construct examples kind. acknowledgements pleasure thank m. dine, y. kiem, d. lowe, s. paban e. witten helpful conversations. work s.s. supported william keck foundation nsf grant phy9513835; m.s. nsf grant dms9870161. 16
