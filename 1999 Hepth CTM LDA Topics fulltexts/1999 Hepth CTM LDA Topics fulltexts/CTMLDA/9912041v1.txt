quantizing yangmills theory: from parisi-wu stochastic quantization
to a global path integral

helmuth huel and gerald kelnhofera

a institut fur theoretische physik, universitat wien, boltzmanngasse 5, a-1090 wien

based on a generalization of the stochastic quantization scheme we recently proposed a generalized, globally
dened faddeev-popov path integral density for the quantization of yang-mills theory.
in this talk rst our
approach on the whole space of gauge potentials is shortly reviewed; in the following we discuss the corresponding
global path integral on the gauge orbit space relating it to the original parisi-wu stochastic quantization scheme.

1. mathematical setting

it is our aim to discuss a globally valid path
integral procedure for the quantization of yang
mills theory based on a recently introduced gener-
alization [14] of the parisiwu stochastic quan-
tization scheme [57]; for dierent globally valid
stochastic interpretations of the faddeevpopov
procedure [8] see [9,10].

let p (m, g) be a principal ber bundle with
compact structure group g over the compact eu-
clidean space time m . let a denote the space of
all irreducible connections on p and let g denote
the gauge group, which is given by all vertical
automorphisms on p reduced by the centre of g.
then g acts freely on a and denes a principal g-
bration a  a/g =: m over the paracompact
[11] space m of all inequivalent gauge potentials
with projection . due to the gribov ambiguity
[12] the principal g-bundle a  m is not glob-
ally trivializable.
from [11] it follows that there exists a locally
nite open cover u = {u} of m together with
a set of background gauge elds {a()
0  a} such

that

2. parisiwu stochastic quanti-

zation

the parisiwu approach for the stochastic
quantization of the yangmills theory is dened
in terms of the langevin equation

s

ds + dw.

da = 
here s denotes the yangmills action without
gauge symmetry breaking terms and without ac-
companying ghost eld terms, s denotes the ex-
tra time coordinate with respect to which the
stochastic process is evolving, dw is the incre-
ment of a wiener process.

instead of analyzing yang-mills theory in the
original eld space a we consider the family of
trivial principal g-bundles   g  , which
are locally isomorphic to the bundle a  m,
where the isomorphisms are provided by the maps
 :   g  1(u),
(b, g) := bg (3)
with b  , g  g and bg denoting the gauge
transformation of b by g.
we transform the parisiwu langevin equa-
tion (3) into the adapted coordinates  =

(cid:18) b
g (cid:19). as this transformation is not globally

2

possible the region of denition of (3) has to be
restricted to 1(u (a()
0 )). making use of the ito
stochastic calculus [13] the above langevin equa-
tion now reads



d =(cid:20)g1

where s = 
s denotes the gauge invari-
ant yang-mills action expressed in terms of the
adapted coordinate b. the explicit form of the
vielbein e corresponding to the change of coor-
dinates a  (b, g), the induced metric g, its
inverse and its determinant can be found in [1];
for completeness we just recall that
det g = 2 (det f)2 (det a()
here  = qdet(r

grg) implies an invariant vol-
ume density on g, where rg is the dierential
of right multiplication transporting any tangent
vector in tgg back to the identity idg on g ;

3. generalized

stochastic

quantization

it is the basic idea of the stochastic quanti-
zation scheme to study in addition to a given
langevin equation the associated fokkerplanck
equation for the probability density  interpret-
ing the equilibrium limit of this density as eu-
clidean path integral measure. it is well known
that such a procedure breaks down in the case of
gauge theories, as due to the gauge invariance no
normalizable equilibrium limit emerges. a gener-
alization of the parisiwu scheme was introduced
in [14] and extended recently in [1] by perform-
ing special, geometrically distinguished modica-
tions of both the drift and diusion terms such
that -most essentially- all expectation values of
gauge invariant observables are left unchanged.
this lead to a well dened fokkerplanck formu-
lation and the equilibrium density was derivable
straightforwardly. the langevin equation (2) ex-
pressed in the adapted coordinates  thus gets

here ee and eg1

 denote a specic viel-
bein and a (inverse) metric, respectively, which
are associated to the above mentioned modi-
cations of the drift and diusion term of (2) or
(4), respectively. the geometric interpretation of
these modications was disucssed in full length
in [1] and [4] and will not be repeated here. stot

g such that esg is integrable with respect to the
invariant volume density , prg is the projector

due to the positivity of eg the uctuation dissi-

pation theorem applies and the equilibrium distri-
bution (for a proper normalization condition see
the next section) is obtained by mere inspection
as

 ,  =pdet g.

although our result implies unconventional
f inite contributions along the gauge group (aris-
ing from the pr
gsg term) it is equivalent to the
usual faddeevpopov prescription [8] for yang
mills theory. this follows from the fact that for
expectation values of gauge invariant observables

these contributions along the gauge group are ex-
actly canceled out due to the normalization of the
path integral. we stress once more that due to
the gribov ambiguity the usual faddeevpopov
approach as well as -presently- our modied ver-
sion are valid only locally in eld space.

4. global path integral

in order to compare expectation values on dif-
ferent patches we consider the dieomorphism
12 in the overlap of the two patches (1 
1(u2 ))  g and (2  1(u1 ))  g which
is given by

12(b, g) := (b2 (b)1

, g).

(11)

here the eld dependent gauge transformation
: 1(u2 )  g is uniquely dened by
2
a2 (a)1
 2. to the density  there is asso-
ciated a corresponding twisted top form on g
which for simplicity we denote by the same sym-
bol. using for convenience a matrix representa-
tion of g [1] we straightforwardly verify that


12 2 = 1 .

(12)

this immediately implies that in overlap regions
the expectation values of gauge invariant observ-
ables f  c(a) are equal when evaluated in
dierent patches. let  be a partition of unity
of m. we propose the denition of the global
expectation value of a gauge invariant observable
f  c(a) by summing over all  such that

 estot

 

(f )

.

(13)

hfi = p rg
p rg

due to (12) it is trivial to prove that the global
expectation value hfi is independent of the spe-
cic choice of the locally nite cover {u}, of the
choice of the background gauge elds {a()
0 } and
of the choice of the partition of unity , respec-
tively.

as already indicated in [1] these structures can
equally be translated into the original eld space
a. with the help of the partition of unity the
locally dened densities  as well as estot
can

be pieced together to give a globally well dened
twisted top form  on a

the second equation follows as a further con-
sequence of (12) and  denotes the at mea-
sure on a. we remark the absence of func-
tional determinants in the path integral measure
and point out the additional unconventional in-
teractions implied by the 1 
gsg terms. the
global expectation value (13) then reads

pr



hfi = ra  f

(15)

which due to the discussion from above is inde-
pendent of all the particular local choices.

5. gauge orbit space formula-

tion

in addition to the global expressions (13) and
(15) for the path integral in the whole space of
connections the generalized stochastic quantiza-
tion scheme also oers the possibility of deriving
the corresponding formulation on the gauge orbit
space m: we consider the projections of either
the original parisiwu langevin equation (4) or
of the modied equation (6) onto the gauge in-
variant subspaces  described by the coordinate
b; in both cases we obtain

notice that in local coordinates (g1

pullback of the restriction on u of the inverse of
a globally dened metric on the gauge orbit space
m induced by the natural metric on a; similarly
e
is dened. since the locally dened equa-

tions (16) are transforming covariantly under the
local dieomorphisms issued by the coordinate
transformations, using [13] it is straightforward

to check that their further projections onto m
are yielding a globally dened stochastic process.
in direct analogy to our derivation of the local
fokkerplanck densities (8) we obtain that the
fokkerplanck equation associated to the pro-
jected langevin equations (16) has an equilibrium
distribution given by just the gauge invariant part
of the densities (8)
detf (det a()
by using (12) we can prove explicitly that their
projections onto m on overlapping sets of u agree
giving rise to a globally well dened top form 
on m. furthermore we can show that the above
expectation values (13) and (15) of gauge invari-
ant observables f can identically be rewritten as
corresponding integrals over the gauge orbit space
m with respect to 
hfi = rm
rm

we note that this last expression shows agree-
ment with the formulation proposed by stora [15]
upon identication of  with the ruelle-sullivan
form. whereas in [15], however, this form of
the expectation values on m appeared as the
starting point for a global formulation of yang-
mills theory in the whole space of gauge poten-
tials it appears in our case as the nal result; we
aimed at its direct derivation within the general-
ized stochastic quantization approach.

we see that the projections onto the local gauge
xing surfaces  of in specic the original parisi
wu stochastic process induce a globally dened
stochastic process on the gauge orbit space yield-
ing the construction of the globally dened path
integral density . we conclude that the globally
dened parisiwu langevin equation (2) on the
whole eld space a is intimately related to the
globally dened path integral density (18) on the
gauge orbit space m.
