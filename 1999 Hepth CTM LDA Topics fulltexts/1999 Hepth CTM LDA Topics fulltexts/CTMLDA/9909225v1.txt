abstract

we construct families of hamiltonians extending the calogero model and

such that a nite number of eigenvectors can be computed algebraically.

1 introduction

the notion of quasi exactly solvable equations has many dierent meanings. initially

[1, 2] it was invented to qualify operators (typically quantum hamiltonian ones)

which, after suitable change of variables and(or) gauge rotation, are equivalent to

an element of the envelopping algebra of some lie algebra, represented by dieren-

tial operators. in the following we refer to the above property as to algebraic qes

property. in opposition some operators can possess a series of values of the coupling

constants for which an explicit eigenvector is available without beeing related to any

representation of a lie algebra. we will qualify this property as weak-qes.

in

the recent few years the calogero model [3] (and several of its extensions [4]) have

received a considerable new impetus of interest. one of the new results was the

construction [5] of a set of variables (the so called  -variables) in which the n-body

calogero model can be written as an element of the enveloping algebra of sl(n). the

1

complete integrability of the model was then directly related to the nite representa-

tions of a lie algebra, following very closely one of the ideas underlying the notion of

quasi exact solvability [1]. some algebraic qes generalisations of the calogero mod-

els were proposed soon after the basic result of [5]. unfortunately these extentions

are all based of an sl(2) algebra. basically, only one of the coordinates, for instance

2, is involved into the additional piece of the potential. the purpose of this note is

to exhibit series of weak-qes hamiltonians, generalizing the calogero hamiltonian,

some of them depending generically of all the  s.

the function (x) is the vandermonde determinant of the matrix mij = (xi)j. more-
over we restrict ourselves to polynomial forms of v (x), p (x), p(x) in x  (x1, x2, . . . , xn ).
the operator acting on p(x) will be denoted h :

hp = ep

they allow to handle respectively the repulsive and the harmonic parts of the potential

in (1).

we have attempted to construct the polynomial potentials v (2, 3,   , n ) such
that the operator (1) is equivalent (after a change of basis and with the variables  )

to an operator preserving one vector space of the form

p(n, n) = span{ n2

2  n3
3

    nn

n | n2 + n3 +    + nn  n}

(13)

our calculations indicate that, for n = 2, 3, 4, 5, the calogero hamiltonian (corre-

sponding to v = 0 in (1)) is the only one to possess such a property. after this

negative result, we investigate alternative possibilities of algebraic solutions by im-

posing weaker requirements. four types of situation have been considered which

presented in the next section.

3 weak-qes hamiltonians

3.1 type 1

we set n = 3; as previously stated v, p, p are then polynomials in 2, 3. use of the
identities of sec. 2 leads to the operator h acting on p(2, 3) :

h = 2

(14)

(15)

we have constructed the solutions of this equation for particular values of the degrees

of p and of p.

p is of degree four

we assume p (x) to be at most quartic in x, i.e.

p =

c
2

 2
2 + b2 + d3

(16)

choosing for p a polynomial of global degree n in 2, 3, a careful power counting in

(6), (14), reveals that polynomial solutions can exist only if vef f is the form

vef f = v12 + v0

(17)

(v0 accounts for the eigenvalue of h, i.e. v0  e). moreover there are generically
+1 parameters (including

1 algebraic equations to be solved and (n+1)(n+2)

(n+2)(n+3)

2

2

the parameters of p and the two dening vef f ). we solved explicitely these equations

for the rst few values of n.

4

let n = 1, then

p = 2 + c13 + c0

(18)

two types of solutions are found after some algebra.

solution (a)

c1 = d = 0

,

v1 = 2c

c0 =

2b + 2 + v0

2c

v0 = b  w 

2  2c  6c + 2b + b2

(19)

this solution does not depend on 3 and is therefore not generic. it depends only on
2 and it has two possible of eigenvalues of the energy (e  v0). it is a particular
case of the qes extension of the calogero model constructed in [6]. the potential

depends on four parameters , , b, c. such solutions can be constructed for any values

of n. the corresponding hamiltonian is an element of the enveloping algebra of sl(2)

realized on the space of polynomials of degree at most n in 2.

solution (b)

c1 = 3c
2d
v1 = 3c

,

,

c0 =

v0 =

3c2

2d2  c  bc
1
c

(2d2  3c  3bc)

which has to be supplemented by one condition on , , b, c, d:

3b2c2 + 6bc2  8bcd2 + 9c3 + 3c3 + 3c22  8cd2 + 4d4 = 0

(20)

(21)

unlike the solution (a), this solution non trivially depends on 2 and 3. the

potential is parametrized by , , b, c, d constrained by (21). one can in principle solve

(21) with respect to one of the constants and obtain a nite number of potentials each

admitting one algebraic eingenvector. this result is similar in spirit to a qes-type

ii equation [1].

repeating the above calculation for n = 2, i.e.

p =  2

2 + c123 + c3 2

3 + c22 + c43 + c5

(22)

as a counterpart of solution (b), we nd the following expressions

v1 = 6c , v0 = 2

2d2  3b c  3c

c1 = 3

c3 =

, c4 =

b c + c   2d2

c d

(23)

(24)

(25)

c5 = (16b2 c2 d2 + 9b c4 + 32b c2 d2   48b c d4 + 9c4

+ 36c3d2  + 15c3 d2 + 16c2 d22  48c d4 + 32d6)/(36c4d2)

(26)

which x the parameters of p and vef f in terms of the coupling constant , , b, c, d.

two supplementary relations, analog to (21), have to be imposed of these coupling

constants

0 = 24b2c2 + 48bc2  64bcd2 + 72c3 + 105c3 + 24c22  64cd2 + 32d4

(27)

0 = 192b3c3d2  108b2c5  576b2c3d2 + 704b2c2d4
 216bc5  576bc4d2  156bc4d2  576bc3d22

 156c4d2 + 576c3 d4 + 216c3 d4  192c3 d23 + 704c2 d42
 768c d6 + 256d8

(28)

so that we end up with a three-parameters family of weak-qes potentials.

p is of degree six

we also considered the case of a polynomial p of degree at most six in x, i.e.

p =

c

 2
2 + b3 + d2 +

c

2 +

(29)

and found that vef f has to be of the form

vef f = v0 + v12 + v23 + v3 2
2

(30)

i.e. at most quartic in the variables xi. solving the equations (6) for n = 3, we

checked that a four-parameter family of weak-qes potentials exists. the form of the

constraints on the parameters rapidly becomes cumbersome when the degree of p

increases.

3.2 type 2

when we demand the functions v, p, p in (1)-(5) to depend on the variable 2 only,
the operator h takes the form

h = 2

2
 2
2

+ (2p  + 22 +

+ (22 +

n  1

(1 + n))p  + 2(p  + (p )2) + v (2)

(31)

where p  = dp
d2

, etc.
the case p =  a

2  b2 corresponds to the qes extension of [6]; the potential
v is then of third degree in 2. however weak-qes potentials of higher degree can

2  2

be constructed. let indeed v be of degree 2 + 1, then a power counting reveals

that p has to be of degree  + 1 and that the algebraic equation (6) can be fullled

with a polynomial p(2) provided a number of  conditions among the 2 + 1 coupling

constants entering in the potential are satised. this results into families of weak-

qes potentials depending of  + 1 parameters.

3.3 type 3

we have reconsidered the qes hamiltonian of [7] and tried to generalize it by fol-

lowing the approach presented in sec.2. the hamiltonian has the form [7]

h =  + v + g

n

(

i,j=1,i6=j

we look for the most general change of function ep and potential v such that

h = ep hep|i

, < qquadi  x2

(33)

is an element of the enveloping algebra of the lie algebra sl(n) in the representation

given by eq.(16) of [5]. after an algebra, we nd a four parameters family of potentials

with

(35)

with g = (  1), g = 2(2  1). this is slightly more general than the potential
given in [7] since the coupling constants g and g are here independent.

3.4 type 4

finally we present a result which directly generalizes to n dimensions the famous

one-dimensional sextic qes potential [1, 2]. in this purpose we consider

h = 

1
2

 + v6(x)

(36)

and assume that the even function v6(x) contain powers of degree at most six in xj.

the most general change of function ep such that the operator

h = ep hep|ti

ti = x2

(37)

is an element of the enveloping algebra of sl(n) (in the representation given by eq.(16)

for n = 2, the 2-body polynomial potential of [2, 8] is then recovered as the special

case q1 = q2 = 0.

summarizing, we have analyzed the rational calogero model from the point of

view of the notion of quasi exact solvability. we found, at least for the small number

of particles, that it is unique in the following sense :

it is exactly solvable but has

no exactly or quasi-exactly solvable translational-invariant extension except those

following from an sl(2) structure. by relaxing the notion of quasi-exact solvability

(weak qes) we were able to nd a number of extensions of the calogero model. they

are characterized by the existence of analytical expressions for some levels without

hidden symmetry behind.
