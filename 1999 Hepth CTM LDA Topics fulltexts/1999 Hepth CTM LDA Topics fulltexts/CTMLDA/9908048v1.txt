abstract

in this note, we review various seemingly dierent ways of obtaining eguchi-hanson
metric with or without a cosmological constant term. interestingly, the conformal
class of metric corresponding to hyperbolic n-monopole solution obtained from
the generalized gibbons-hawking ansatz, reduces to the eguchi-hanson metric
in a particular limit. these results, though known from an algebraic geometry
point of view, are useful while dealing with rotational killing symmetry of self-dual
metrics in general theory of relativity as well as in the context of duality symmetry
in string theory.

gravitational instanton solutions in the context of euclidean gravity and string theory
have become the subject of much interest in recent times. they are dened to be non-
singular, complete, positive denite (riemanninan metric) solutions of vacuum einstein
equations or einstein equations with a cosmological constant term [1, 2]. the existence
of such solutions is important in the study of quantum theory of gravity. these are anal-
ogous to yang-mills instantons [3], which are dened as nonsingular solutions of classical
equations in four dimensional euclidean space. the yang-mills instantons are character-
ized by self-dual eld strengths, whereas the gravitational instantons are characterized by
self-dual or anti self-dual curvature. there are also examples of gravitational instantons
which are not self-dual, those are the euclidean version of schwarzschild and kerr solu-
tions. the four dimensional riemannian manifolds (m, gab) for gravitational instantons
can be asymptotically at (af), asymptotically locally euclidean (ale), asymptotically
locally at (alf) or compact without boundary. multi taub-nut solution of hawking
[4] is an example of alf space. the simplest nontrivial example of ale spaces is the
metric of eguchi-hanson [5]. ale instantons have been found explicitly by gibbons
and hawking [6] and they are known implicitly through the work of hitchin [7] the
complex projective space cp 2 is an example of compact, anti self-dual instanton solving
einsteins equation with a cosmological constant term [8].

there are two topological invariants associated with these solutions, namely the euler
characteristic  and the hirzebruch signature  , which can be expressed as integrals of
the curvature of a four dimensional metric. the topological invariants are also related to
nuts (isolated points) and bolts (two surfaces), which are the xed points of the action of
one parameter isometry groups of gravitational instantons. the eguchi-hanson metric
is given by,

this metric has a single removable bolt singularity provided  lies in the range 0 <
 < 2. asymptotically the topology of the manifold is s 3/z2 which is not globally
euclidean. near r = a, the manifold has the topology r2  s 2. the self dual euclidean
taub-nut solution is given by,
r + m

this metric has a single removable nut singularity. both the above metrics have self-dual
riemann curvature, where the dual of the riemann tensor rijkm is dened as,

the metric has a nut as well as a bolt type of sungularity. all these three metrics can
be derived from a more general three parameter euclidean taub-nut de sitter metric
through some limiting procedure. this limiting procedure to obtain the corresponding
solutions in string theory has been discussed in [9].
the taub-nut de sitter metric is given by,

ds2 =

(10)

in the above. putting  = 0 and then taking the limit l   with r2 = 2  l2 held
xed, one obtains the eguchi- hanson metric. if one does not put  = 0, then it reduces
to the eguchi-hanson de sitter metric given by,

this metric satises einstein equation with a positive cosmological constant. an analo-
gous solution has been derived by pedersen [11] and the solution has been interpreted as
a nonlinear superposition of eguchi-hanson and pseudo fubini-study solution. there is
an apparent singularity where 1  a4
6 = 0 which can be removed by adjusting the
parameter a.

r4  r2

the above solution can also be derived as a generalization of the vacuum einstein solution
obtained through a twistor theoretical method [12]. the vacuum solution was of the form,

ds2 =

1
4r3 [(dr  2mr2z)2 + 4r2(2

x + 2

y + 2

z )]

(12)

this vacuum solution has been obtained by generalizing lebruns work on h-spaces with
cosmological constant [13] to the berger sphere (3-sphere squashed in one direction). the
metric on the berger sphere is given by,

ds2 = d2 + sin2 d2 + cos2 (d + cos d)2

(13)

3

where  is a xed constant. for  = 0, the metric reduces to that of the metric on 3-
sphere s 3. more generally, the metric on berger sphere can be written as 2
y + i32
z ,
where i3 is a constant. the null geodesics of the berger sphere also describe the motion of
a symmetric top where i3 can be recognized as the moment of inertia along the third body
axes. the complex three dimensional twistor space z of unparametrized null geodesics
of the berger sphere is described by a trivial line bundle over plane sections of the
quadric. the line bundle then generates a conformal structure and a u(1) monopole on
s 3 characterized by the higgs eld v and a gauge potential a. the conformal structure
is given by,

x + 2

g = v (d2 + sin2 (d2 + sin2 d2)) + v 1(d + a)2

(14)

here the monopole solution is characterized by (v, a) = ( + m cot , m cos d) and one
takes  = m2 = i 1
3  1. we do not go to the discussion on the construction of the
twistor space of unparametrized null geodesics of the berger sphere. for details on the
construction of the twistor space see [12]. here we are interested in the corresponding
solution of the einstein equation with a cosmological constant which is given by,

g = f ()2[( + m cot )(d2 + sin2 (d2 + sin2 d2))

(15)

+

m2

 + m cot 

(d + cos d)2]

where  and m are two parameters which can be adjusted appropriately. solving the

einsteins equations with a cosmological constant term (pl rlilj = ij), one obtains,

where k =  3
transformation, the metric can be simplied to a desired form,

for k = m2/4,  = m2 and substituting r = 2, one obtains the self-dual metric (which
is conformally equivalent to the metric on the berger sphere) as [12],

(19)

for  = 0 and k = m2/4, the cosmological constant goes to zero and the new metric
reduces to that of eguchi-hanson i (identifying m2 with a4). though the above deriva-
tions assume i3 < 1 and m2 > 0, one can relax this constraint and get a valid solution
for m2 negative. taking m2 = a4 and r = r2, the vacuum solution is of the form,

ds2 = (dr 

ia2
r

z)2 + r2(2

x + 2

y + 2
z )

(20)

a more general solution of einsteins equation with a cosmological constant can be
written as [11]

ds2 = [dr  ig(r)z]2 + r2(2

x + 2

y + 2
z )

(21)

by solving the einstein equation, one can show that the solution is given by g(r) =
(a4/r2 + b2r4)1/2 and it satises the einsteins equation with  = 6b2. when b = 0,
the above metric reduces to the eguchi-hanson solution. this can be seen by dening
a new function dh(r) = 2ia2
r2 )1dr and making a coordinate transformation
 =   h(r). this brings the metric to the standard form,

r (r2  a4

ds2 = (1 

where,

similarly, in the limit a = 0, the metric reduces to,

ds2 = (dr  ibr2z)2 + r2(2

x + 2

y + 2
z )

(22)

(23)
(24)

(25)

again dening a new function dk(r) = 2ib(1  b2r2)1dr and putting  =   k(r),
one obtains the (pseudo) fubini-study metric on cp 2 given by,

ds2 =

dr2 + r22
z
(1  r2

r2(2

,

 > 0

(26)

where we have substituted  = 6b2 and the coordinate r has been dened as r2 =
r2(1 r2
6 )1. for both a and b nonzero, one can again dene a new function and make
a coordinate transformation such as,

dg(r) =

2i
r

(

a4
r4  b2r2)1/2(1 

a4
r4  b2r2)1dr,

 =   g(r)

(27)

and the above metric is then recognized as the eguchi-hanson de sitter metric given by,

ds2 = (1

1 + 2

2) + r2(1

this is precisely the metric one obtains from taub-nut de sitter solution through a
singular limiting procedure as we discussed before.

the above metric has an apparant singularity where  = 0, which can be removed by
adjusting the parameter a. here, for example, the removable bolt singularity occurs at

r = s 2(n  2)



,

n  3

(29)

this metric has the interpretation of the nonlinear superposition of the eguchi-hanson
metric ii and the pseudo fubini-study metric. note that the metric of the form

ds2 = [dr  (

a4
r2 + b2r4)1/2z]2 + r2(2

x + 2

y + 2
z )

(30)

satises einsteins equation with a negative cosmological constant ( = 6b2), which
again reduces to eguchi-hanson for b = 0 and (pseudo) fubini-study solution for a = 0
[11].

next we discuss a very dierent method of obtaining the ale metric as a limit of the
self-dual metrics on the connected sum of ncp 2 (which is related to the hyperbolic n-
monopole solution). gibbons and hawking have given the ansatz for the multi-center
metric in the form

ds2 = v 1(x)(d +   dx)2 + v (x)ijdxi  dxj

(31)

with v = . v satises the three dimensional laplace equation 2v = 0, whose
most general solution is given by,

v (x) =  +

n

xi=1

mi

|x  xi|

(32)

where  and mi are constants. for removable nut singularities, one takes all the mi to
be equal (mi = m) and  sould be periodic with the range 0    8m/n. the
value  = 1 corresponds to alf metrics (the self-dual taub-nut solution corresponds
to n = 1). for  = 0, one obtains the ale metrics (n = 1 corresponds to at space,
n = 2 corresponds to eguchi-hanson and so on). the ale and alf metrics are related
to each other through a sequence of t  s  t duality transformation (more precisely
through ehlers transformation) [14].

there has been attempt to nd all the riemannian metrics with atleast one killing vector
eld [15]. there are two classes of these solutions depending on the type of killing sym-
metry. one class of metrics admits translational killing vectors and is determined by v
satisfying the 3-dimensional laplace equation in euclidean space. the other class of met-
rics admit rotational killing symmetry, where the metric is determined by a scalar eld
satifying a non linear partial dierential equation, namely the continual toda equation.
in the above form of the metric, i are the components of connection 1-form on the three

6

dimesional riemannian manifold. the distinction between the translational and rota-
tonal killing symmetry is made by examining whether the quantity   ijij = 0
(translational) or  > 0 (rotational). here  is a scalar eld consisting of the nut
potential and the v appearing in gibbons-hawking ansatz. in string theory context,
this scalar eld is a combination of the axion and dilaton elds (s = b  e2). choos-
ing one of these conjugate elds s, the constraint is whether s = 0 or s > 0.
this analysis is useful while dealing with the sequence of t  s  t duality transfor-
mations. this sequence of duality transformations take a pure gravitaional background
to another pure gravitational background with a ricci at metric [14]. in the rotational
killing symmetry case, the self duality of the original background gets broken, wheras
the self-duality condition is preserved if one performs the t-duality transformation with
respect to the translational killing symmetry. a supersymmetric explanation for the
violation of self-duality has been provided in [16].

in general theory of relativity, the previously discussed nonlinear dierential equations
are the heavenly eqations which arise in the context of self-dual einstein spaces with
one rotational killing vector. interestingly, these equations also arise in the context of
problems in dierential geometry, namely the construction of half-at metric on the
connected sum of n copies of the complex projective space cp 2. for compact, self-
dual manifolds x with positive scalar curvature, a theorem in riemannian geometry
says that x is isometric to the euclidean 4-sphere or the complex projective plane
cp 2 with the fubini-study metric. there has been lot of work to enlarge this set
of examples of compact, self-dual manifolds (here self-duality means the anti-self-dual
part of the weyl curvature w  vanishes) apart from the conformally at s 4, cp 2 and
k3. for example, using twistor methods, poon has constructed families of self-dual
structures on the connected sum of 2cp 2 (cp 2#cp 2) and 3cp 2 (cp 2#cp 2#cp 2)
[17]. donaldson and friedman have given general conditions under which the connected
sum of two self-dual riemannian 4-manifolds again admit a self-dual structure. they
have also given a twistor technique for constructing self-dual structure on the connected
sums [18].
if x1 and x2 are two self-dual manifolds with twistor spaces z1 and z2
(3-dimensional complex manifolds) respectively, then the idea is to look for metrics in
the connected sum x1#x2 which is close to the original metric outside a small neck
where the connected sum is made. using the gluing procedure, floer has also shown
the existence of conformal structures with self-dual weyl tensor in the connected sum of
n copies of complex projective space cp 2, (n > 0) [19]. the conformal structures can
be represented by metrics of positive scalar curvature. here we should mention that a
conformal structure on a smooth nite dimensional manifold m is an equivalence class
[g] of riemannian metrics g on m, where g1 and g2 are conformally equivalent if there
exists a non vanishing function f such that g2 = f g1.
in four dimensions, the weyl
tensor w can be decomposed in an invariant way to w+ + w. the conformal structure
[g] is self-dual if w = 0 and hence it satises half of the integrability condition. in the
twistor approach, one constructs a certain complex space z using z1 and z2 and looks
for twistor spaces made by small smoothings of z. if such smoothings exist, then they

7

always represent the twistor spaces of self-dual structures on the connected sum.
explicit self-dual metrics on the connected sum of ncp 2 has been constructed by lebrun
[20]. the construction generalizes the gibbons-hawking ansatz for obtaining ricci at
hyperkahler manifolds. basically the three dimensional euclidean space gets replaced
by the hyperbolic 3-space and metrics are conformally kahler with vanishning scalar
curvature. the extra ingredient here is the circle (s 1) isometry. let us elaborate a little
bit on this. the self-dual yang-mills equation on r4 (giving instanton solutions) and
the bogomolnyi equation on r3 (giving monopole solutions) are respectively given by,

 f = f
dv = f

(33)
(34)

where v is the higgs eld and f is the curvature of a connection a, d is the covariant
derivative w.r.t. a and  is the duality operator with respect to the euclidean metric.
one knows that the solutions of self-dual yang-mills equations which are independent
of the coordinate x4 (translationally invariant) reduce to the solution of the bogomolnyi
equation in r3. if instead, we consider rotationally invariant solutions of the self-dual
yang-mills equations in r4, then the euclidean metric can be rewritten as,

ds2 = r2"dx2

1 + dx2
r2

2 + dr2

+ d2#

(35)

where we have used polar coordinates r and  for the rotational invariance relative to
angular rotation in the (x3, x4) plane. the rst factor on r .h.s corresponds to the metric
on the hyperbolic 3-space h 3 (can be represented as the upper-half space z > 0 in x,
y, z coordinates) of constant curvature 1. the above equation implies a conformal
equivalence (with r2 as the conformal factor),

r4  r2  h 3  s 1

(36)

this means that s 1 invariant solutions (solutions independent of ) of the self-dual yang-
mills equations reduce to the magnetic monopole solutions (solutions of bogomolnyi
equation) on the hyperbolic 3-space h 3 [21]. this conformal equivalence is a special
case of more general equivalence rn  rm  h m+1  snm1, m < n.
the generalized gibbons-hawking ansatz is given by [20],

g = euw(dx2 + dy2) + wdz2 + w1f 2

(37)

where g is a scalar at kahler metric. f is the connection 1-form, u and w are two
smooth real valued functions on an open set r3 and they satisfy the partial dierential
equations,

uxx + uyy + (eu)zz = 0
wxx + wyy + (weu)zz = 0

8

(38)
(39)

one can recognize these two equations as the continual toda equations and its linearliza-
tions. note that the generalized ansatz reduces to that of the gibbons-hawking ansatz
if we set u = 0. then the above equations just reduce to the 3-dimensional laplace
equation as discussed before.
in the context of the generalized ansatz, consider the kahler form on c 2  {~0} which is
given by,

 = 

i
2

 (||z||2 + m log ||z||2)

the kahler potential is given by,

 =

1
2

(||z||2 + m log ||z||2)

(40)

(41)

where, (||z||2 = z1 z1 + z2z2) and m is a positive constant. the above kahler form denes
a zero scalar curvature kahler metric. this follows from the theorem of lebrun [22]
that for m = mcp 2, 0  m  3 equipped with a self-dual metric g of positive scalar
curvature, there exists atleast one point p  m such that (m  {p}, g) is conformally
isometric to c 2 with m points blown up equipped with an asymptotically at kahler
metric of zero scalar curvature. the above kahler form on c 2  {0} corresponds to the
case m = 1. computation of the volume form of the above metric gives u = log 2z,
which is invariant under translations in both x and y. using this, the second equation
reduces to,

wxx + wyy + (2zw)zz = 0

(42)

dening a new variable v = 2zw, this equation just reduces to the laplace-beltrami
equation v = 0, where,  is the laplace-beltrami operator of the riemannian metric
in the upper half space. the metric on the upper half space {(x, y, z)  r3|z > 0} is
given by,

in terms of another coordinate q = 2z, the above metric becomes,

h =

+

dz2
4z2

dx2 + dy2

2z

h =

dx2 + dy2 + dq2

q2

(43)

(44)

which is infact the metric on the hyperbolic 3-space h 3. now using h and the new
variable v , the generalized gibbons-hawking ansatz reads,

g = 2z(v h + v 1f 2)

(45)

one can show that in terms of the hyperbolic distance  from the point (x, y, q) =
(0, 0, q0) in the upper half space, v corresponds to a single hyperbolic monopole solution,

v = 2zw = 1 +

(47)

(48)

(51)

(52)

one can show that the metric g = q2[v h + v 1f 2] represents a scalar at, asymptotically
at kahler metric on the blow up of c 2 at n-points [20]. the conformal class of the
above metric represents the self-dual metric on the connected sum of ncp 2, whose scalar
curvature is positive. there exists an interesting limit of this conformal metric. if all the
centres p1, . . . pn coincide to a single point, it denes a self-dual compact orbifold with
an isolated singular point p. interestingly, the space h 3  p with a suitable conformal
factor gives rise to self-dual ale manifold, which we discuss below.
identifying the space h 3  p with r+  s 2, the hyperbolic metric can be written as,

h = d2 + sinh2 gs 2

(53)

where gs 2 is the metric on the 2-sphere and  is the radial coordinate. since all the centres
coincide, v = 1+ n
e21. the circle bundle can be identied with r+(s 3/zn)  r+s 2.
by considering the projection from the lens space s 3/zn to s 2 induced by the hopf map,
the connection 1-form can be suitably chosen to be f = nz [20]. substituting the
expressions for v and h, one nds that the metric corresponding to generalized gibbons-
hawking ansatz is conformally equivalent to (the conformal factor being 4 sinh2 ),

g =

(55)

where, a = n  2 and b = 1  n. one can see that for n = 2, we have a = 0 and
b = 1 and the metric precisely reduces to the eguchi-hanson metric in the standard
form with the integration constant a = 1:

g = (1

r4 )1dr2 + r2(2

2) + r2(1

r4 )2

(56)

this limiting procedure can be understood from the hyperbolic space structure here.
the hyperbolic metric of constant negative curvature automatically arises by considering
rotational killing symmetry. by varying the curvature of the hyperbolic space and letting
it tend to zero, the euclidean space appears naturally as a limit of the hyperbolic 3-space.
we can rewrite the metric on h 3  s 1 as,

ds2 =

r2

r2 "r2(dx2 + dy2 + dr2)

r2

+ r2d2#

(57)

the conformal equivalence in this case becomes r4  r2  h 3(r) s 1(r), where s 1(r)
is the circle of radius r and h 3(r) is the hyperbolic space of curvature r. one then
considers the limiting process where the curvature of the hyperbolic space tends to zero
and the limiting conformal structure near the point p is a gibbons-hawking metric. from
the above, it is clear that an s 1 invariant instanton of weight s on r4 denes a monopole
on h 3(r). because there is a scale change in the circle, the higgs eld tends to r1s at
innity. then taking r = s, the monopoles on h 3 are reinterpreted as a monopole on
h 3(s1) [21]. as s  , the hyperbolic space h 3(s1) tends to the at space r3 and
in this limit, the hyperbolic monopole becomes indeed an ordinary monopole.

in this note, we have discussed various dierent ways of obtaining eguchi-hanson metrics
with or without cosmological constant term through some limiting procedure. we also
discussed the generalized gibbons-hawking ansatz of lebrun in the context of non linear
partial dierential equation namely the continual toda equation and its linearization
arising for rotational killing symmetry. for the example discussed in the text, in the
context of rotational killing symmetry, one obtains the hyperbolic analog of gibbons-
hawking metric and again one reproduces ale metric as a limit of the self-dual metrics
on the connected sum of ncp2. this might be interesting in the context of d-branes on
resoved ale spaces [23].
