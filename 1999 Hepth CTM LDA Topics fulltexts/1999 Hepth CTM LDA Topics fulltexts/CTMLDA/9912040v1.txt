abstract 4. we consider vacuum quantum eects in the early universe, which may lead
to ination. the ination is a direct consequence of the supposition that, at high energies,
all the particles can be described by the weakly interacting, massless, conformally invariant
elds. we discuss, from the eective eld theory point of view, the stability of ination,
transition to the frw solution, and also possibility to study metric and density perturba-
tions.

the aim of the present article is to discuss the importance of the quantum eects of
vacuum for the evolution of the early universe.
in particular, we shall present a strong
arguments that the eective action of vacuum induced by conformal anomaly produces in-
ation in a very natural way. this problem was previously discussed in [1, 2] and studied in
details in [3, 4] (see also [5]), but we hope to shed some more light on it and also draw some
prospects and frameworks for the future studies.

let us start from the description of possible physical situation in the early universe, in
which the trace anomaly plays the leading role. the main supposition is that there is a desert
in the particle spectrum between the planck mass mp  1019gev and the heaviest massive
particle. this assumption has serious backgrounds, because the existing particle theories
indicate that the unication point lies as mx  1014  1016gev . for greater simplicity one
can suppose that the u(1)  su(2)l  su(3) standard model of the particle physics is
valid till mp scale, that makes a desired desert very large. then, all the matter elds below
the mp scale can be described by the eective local quantum eld theory. moreover, if the
desert is long enough, at high energies all the particles can be safely treated as massless.
then we can apply the standard relation p = 1/3  between pressure and energy density for
the massless particles. if we turn to the eld description, this relation indicates that all the
elds possess not only global, but also local conformal invariance [5]. on the other hand,
for very large kinetic energy, the potential energy of the interactions between quantum
elds is disregardable, except the vacuum eects. thus, the most natural model for the
early universe is the curved manifold lled by the free, massless, conformal invariant elds.
suppose, the underlying matter theory has n0 scalars, n1/2 dirac spinors (weyl spinors may
be treated in a similar way), and n1 vectors. the quantum eects of these elds on curved
background will be the object of our present study.

the classical solution for the pure radiation case is usual a  t1/2. however, in the high
energy region below mp the vacuum quantum eects of matter elds must be taken into
account, and the geometry of the background may change. for the situation described above,

the leading quantum eect is the one related to the renormalization of the vacuum action
[6, 7]. this action includes, for the conformal case, three necessary structures (conformal
invariant and surface terms):

svac = z d4xg nl1c 2 + l2e + l32ro ,

(1)

where l1,2,3 are some parameters, c 2 is the square of the weyl tensor and e is the integrand of
the gauss-bonnet topological (in d = 4) invariant. one has to notice that the introduction

of the non-conformal terms like r gr or r gr2 is possible but not necessary for

the renormalization of the free conformal invariant theories. in other words, non-conformal
terms do not renormalize.

the renormalization of the action (1) leads to conformal anomaly [8] and to the anomaly-

induced eective action [9, 10] (see also [7]). this action can be written in the form:

and sc[g] is some unknown conformal-invariant functional. in general, exact calculation of
this functional is impossible. as far as we are interested in the conformally at cosmological
solutions, this functional has no importance. however it becomes relevant for we intend to
study some non-isotropy, and in particular explore metric perturbations. the situation with
the perturbations is quite similar to the one for the black-hole physics. in the last case one
can apply the reigert solution (2) and achieve correct result for the hawking radiation,
but only for the particular choice of sc[g]

[11].

it is important to notice that the solution (2) can be rewritten in the covariant but non-
local form [9]. in turn, this can be transformed again into local expression depending on two
auxiliary scalar elds  and  [9, 11].

indeed this local covariant formulation is more suitable for the study of metric perturbations.
however the isotropic solution can be achieved on the basis of the action (2). for the early
universe the curvature (positive or negative) of the space section of the space-time has no
importance, and thus one can restrict consideration by the conformally at case.

let us derive the equation of motion for the (), put g =  and pass to the new
variables: physical time d = a()  dt and h(t) = a(t)/a(t). the equation for h(t) has the

positive sign corresponds to ination. the solution (6) was rst discovered and studied in
[2, 3, 4] 5. here we shall discuss the behaviour of the a(t) on the basis of the eective
approach to quantum theory. the inationary solution for the local covariant version of the
induced action (4) can be achieved, and the behaviour of the conformal factor is the same as
in (6). at the same time the inationary solution of (4) contains the arbitrariness related to
the boundary conditions for the auxiliary elds , . we remark that in the black-hole case
this arbitrariness allows one to classify the vacuum states [11], and therefore it is natural to
expect that it can be successfully used in the study of the metric perturbations around the
solution (6).

the detailed analysis shows [3, 5] that the special solution is stable with respect to the
variations of a(t), if the parameters of the underlying quantum theory satisfy the condition

c < 0, that leads, according to (3), to the relation6

with this constraint satised, the theory goes to ination independent on the initial condi-
tions, and the ination is eternal  unless the masses of the particles become seen and change
the structure of eective action. we remark that the coecient c in (3) can be modied by

adding nite r gr2-term to the vacuum action. this coecient does not renormalize in

the free theory and has very week running in the interaction theory [13], but it can provide
the stability of ination for any particle content. below we do not consider this term.

let us remind that the basis for the above solution is an eective action induced by
conformal anomaly  that is the quantum eect of the massless conformal invariant elds.
in order to achieve better understanding of the approximation, let us suppose that the elds
possess masses, and call typical mass m. for simplicity, one can imagine that we have just
a massive scalar with  = 1/6, but the consideration is the same for the spinor case. one

5in [3] two other similar solutions for the frw metric with k = 1 were found.
6this constraint is not satised for the minimal standard model (msm), but it is may be easily achieved
in some generalizations including the supersymmetric msm. the constraint imposed in [12] also provides
stability of ination.

can derive the anomaly through the jacobian of the conformal change of variables in the
eective action of vacuum.

ivac = isvac + ln z d exp{i smatter[, g]} .

(8)

then, using the relation h2g

metric, that the eective action of vacuum is given, in the case, by the sum

where the last contribution is proportional to the massive parameter m2. also, in the
matter action, only the massive part does not decouple from the a(t), and therefore all
manifestations of the particle mass is proportional to the m2. indeed, the last term in (9)
is divergent and leads to the renormalization of the einstein-hilbert and cosmological terms,
which should be, in the case, included to the svac. we remark, that the renormalization of
the cosmological constant leads to its running and therefore to the appearance of the nite
cosmological constant due to the mechanism recently described in [14]. however, this nite
cosmological constant is also proportional to m2. in the equation for a(t) one can pass to
the feynman graf description [15], and then, in the momentum space, the time derivatives
will be substituted by the energy . then, in the massive case, the equations which govern
the cosmological evolution, have the symbolic form:

oind(4) + ogr(2  m 2

p ) + omassive(2  m2) = 0 .

(10)

at this point one can apply the eective approach to consider the problem of transition to
the power-like frw universe. consider rst the very early universe, with   mp . one
can, according to our desert hypothesis, suppose that the heaviest particle has a mass
about 100gev . then the rst two terms in (10) are of the same order, while the last one is
suppresses by the factor of 1034. this is the ination region, and in case of (7) satised we
meet universal behaviour (6).

now, let us consider another end of the mass scale, when   1012gev (modern cosmic
scale). then the rst (anomaly induced) term is (10) is suppressed by the factor of 1028
compared to the last massive term, and by the factor of 1062 compared to the einstein
part. indeed, the universe does not see quantum eects, and evolves by the usual power
low. this simple consideration shows that there cannot be any unique equation for the
universe, that could govern its evolution from the start to the end.
instead, one has to
divide the evolution for some periods which have essentially distinct dynamics.

indeed, the most complicated is the intermediate period with  comparable to the masses
of the matter particles. however, in this region the derivation of quantum correction to the
eective action meets serious diculties. first of all, exact calculation of the non-local part
of the eective action of the massive elds is unsolved problem, even within the perturbation
theory. besides, the qcd vacuum eects are essentially non-perturbative, and in particular
may produce the topological solutions that could also contribute to the dynamics. indeed,
one can consider some simplied models (it is natural to regard [1] as the rst attempt of
this kind) to investigate the intermediate stage, and thus describe a smooth transition from
ination to the modern universe.

the model of ination described above (it is usually referred to as the starobinsky model),
has serious advantages as compared to the usual models based on the inaton [16]. the
main advantage is, of course, the naturalness of ination, which appears as unavoidable
consequence of the desert on the mass scale and the constraint on the particle spectrum
(7). on the other hand, in order to compete with the inaton models, the theory must pass
the series of tests, and in particular provide the correct density and metric perturbation
spectrum. on the other hand, as it was already mentioned above, when we study the
perturbation, the conformal invariant functional sc[g] in (2) becomes relevant, and its
proper choice is expected to provide the desirable result [17].
