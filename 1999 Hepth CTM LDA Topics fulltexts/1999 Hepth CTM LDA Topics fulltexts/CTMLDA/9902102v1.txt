abstract

we show that the transformation of d-branes under t-duality on four-
torus is represented by nahm transform of instantons. the argument for
this allows us to generalize nahm transform to the case of orthogonal and
symplectic gauge groups as well as to instantons on z2 orbifold of four-torus.
in addition, we identify the isomorphism of k-theory groups that realizes
the transformation of d-brane charges under t-duality on torus of arbitrary
dimensions. by the isomorphism we are lead to identify the correct k-theory
group that classies d-brane charges in type ii orientifold.

introduction

a dp-brane wrapped on a circle is mapped under t-duality to a d(p 1)-brane where
the u(1) wilson line of the dp-brane corresponds to the position of the d(p  1)-brane
in the dual circle. this was known since the discovery of d-branes [1] and this is actually
how d-branes are discovered. however, the t-duality transformation rule is less obvious
for more general conguration of d-branes in a more general string background.

in superstring theory, d-branes are sources of ramond-ramond (rr) potentials [2].
transformation of rr elds under t-duality was studied in [3, 4]. rr elds of the theory

on t n  m and those of the t-dual theory on bt n  m are related as

debf = zt n

ch(p) ebf.

(1.1)

here, b is the neveu-schwarz b-eld and f =pp fp+2 is the sum of gauge invariant rr
eld strengths where the sum is over p = 0, 2, 4, . . . for type iia and p = 1, 1, 3, . . . for
type iib.1 also, ch(p) = exp(pn
i=1 dbti  dti) in which ti and bti are coordinates of t n and
bt n dual to each other. as the name suggests, ch(p) represents the chern character of
a complex line bundle over bt n  t n  the so called poincare bundle p  which has a
u(1) connection with curvature 2ipi dbti  dti.

the simplicity of the transformation rule (1.1) is intriguing and begs for an explanation
which is independent of the supergravity or worldsheet computation. it is also interesting
to ask whether similar rule exists for more general cases, such as the case with orbifold or
orientifold projection. we note here that (1.1) looks like a formula which appears in the
family index theory [57]; in particular, for a family of dirac operators on t n parametrized

by bt n which is carried by a bundle over t n  bt n determined by p. since d-branes are

rr sources, this suggests that there is a similar index-theoretic transformation rule for
d-branes, which might lead to a simplest explanation for (1.1) and to its generalization.
the purpose of this paper is to nd such a transformation rule for d-brane congurations.

actually, it has been suspected that an index-theoretic transformation realizes t-
duality on four-torus t 4 (and also t n with n = 1, 2, 3) in the case where there are
dp-branes at points on t 4 within wrapped d(p + 4)-branes. in such a case, a d-brane
conguration can be represented as an instanton conguration on t 4, and it was suggested
in [8] that t-duality may possibly be realized as a transform of representing instanton

1we choose the following eld denitions. the gauge transformation for the r-r potential a =

p ap+1 is given by a = ebd for  = p p, and therefore the gauge invariant eld strength is

f = ebd(eba) = da  h  a subject to the bianchi identity df = h  f .

congurations called nahm transform [1012] (or mukais fourier transform [9]). nahm

transform uses a family of dirac operators on t 4 parametrized by bt 4 which is carried
by the poincare bundle p, and the transformation of the topological numbers of the
instantons is given by an index formula which looks like (1.1). in particular, the rank and
the instanton number are interchanged. in terms of d-brane charges, this corresponds to
the interchange of (p+4)-brane and p-brane charges which is exactly what t-duality does.
however, there was no other argument showing why the nahm transform can be identied
with the t-duality on four-torus. in this paper, we provide a simple argument which shows
that one can indeed identify the nahm transform and t-duality. the argument is so simple
that it can be easily generalized to the case with orbifold/orientifold projection, nding
a generalization of the nahm transform to, say, orthogonal/symplectic gauge groups.

of t n  m to another k-theory group of the dual bt n  m.

based on recent analysis of brane-anti-brane systems (e.g.[13]), it was argued by wit-
ten [14] (and subsequently e.g. in [15]) that d-brane charge takes values in an appropriate
k-theory group of the space-time x when x is large compared to the string scale. if this
also holds for any size of x, t-duality should induce an isomorphism of a k-theory group
in fact, brane-anti-brane
systems naturally appear in our argument for nahm transform = t-duality, and an
isomorphism between k-theory groups emegres very naturally. this seems to be actually
not limited to four-torus; as another non-trivial application of our argument, we will
construct the isomorphism of k-theory groups for t-duality on torus of other dimensions.
during the course, we nd the correct identication of the k-theory group for type ii
orientifold: d-brane charges in the presence of an orientifold p-plane are classied by
kr(9p) or kr(5p) for so- or sp-type orientifold respectively (we were informed after
completion of the work that this was also found independently in [16]).

this paper is organized as follows.

in section 2, we give a simple argument which
shows that nahm-transform can indeed be identied as the transform of d-branes under
t-duality on four-torus. we extend the argument to the case where the nahm transform
fails to become a vector bundle and give the interpretation of the resulting object as a
certain bound state of d-branes and anti-d-branes. the basic argument of section 2 is
applied in section 3 to string theory with orientifold or orbifold projections. this leads to
the generalization of nahm transform to instantons of orthogonal and symplectic gauge
groups as well as to instantons on z2 orbifold.
in section 4, as an application of the
picture of brane-anti-brane bound state, we obtain index-theoretic isomorphisms of k-
theory groups that realizes t-duality on four-torus. this is extended in section 5 to nd
isomorphisms of k-theory groups for t-duality on torus of other dimensions. there we
also indentify the correct k-theory group that classies d-branes in type ii orientifold.

2 d-branes on four-torus and t-duality

in this section we study how d-brane congurations are transformed under t-duality

on four-torus in type ii string theory.

let us consider type ii string theory on r6  t 4 with n d(p + 4)-branes wrapped
on t 4. we choose at orthonormal space-time coordinates xm = x0, . . . , x9 and consider
t 4 as r4/ where r4 is spanned by x = x1, x2, x3, x4 and  = {n}  r4 is a lattice of
rank four. the theory contains u(n) super-yang-mills theory on the brane with sixteen
supercharges. the supersymmetry transformation of the gaugino  is given by

 = 

1
4

fm n m n 

(2.1)

2f 

where  is an anticommuting parameter which is a positive chirality spinor in ten dimen-
sions and fm n is the eld strength of the (extended) u(n) gauge eld. if the gauge eld
has a self-dual eld strength on t 4 with non-zero instanton number, the supersymmetry is
broken to half and only those with positive chirality on t 4 are unbroken. this is because
f = 1
 on spinors with chirality  on t 4 where f  = f f . 1 this together
with the fact that an instanton on d(p + 4)-branes carries a unit charge of the rr p-form
potential through the chern-simons coupling [17] suggest that the instantons on t 4 can be
identied with dp-branes at points of t 4. namely, n d(p + 4)-branes with a k-instanton
conguration on t 4 can be considered as a classical bound state of n d(p + 4)-branes
and k dp-branes. this description of dp-branes as instantons on d(p + 4)-branes is of
course valid only when the size of the torus is large compared to the string scale.

now we address the following question: how is t-duality transformation of d-branes
described in terms of gauge elds on t 4? we rst have to note that t-duality inverts the
size of the torus (when b-eld is zero) with respect to the string scale. thus, the question
makes sense only when there is a natural one-to-one correspondence between d-brane
congurations on large and small torus. in the present case, eight supersymmetries and
non-renormalization theorm assures this, since parameters for d-brane conguration and
the size of the torus belongs to dierent supermultiplets.

1in this paper, positive or + (resp. negative or ) chirality in four dimensions means 1234 = 1
(resp. 1) (and likewise, in 1+1 or 5+1 dimensions (spanning 09 or 012349 directions), it means 09 or
012349 = 1 (resp. 1)). this convention in four-dimensions appears to conict with the convention in
mathematical notation where in even dimension (2n) spinor bundles with in122n = 1 is denoted as
s. nevertheless, we shall follow this mathematical convention as far as the notation s is concerned.
thus, in this paper the bundle of positive (or +) chirality spinors (with 1234 = 1) is denoted as s
whereas s + is the bundle of negative (or ) chirality spinors (with 1234 = 1). i hope that this does
not confuse the reader.

3

in what follows we provide an answer to this question. we will work in the case p = 5
since we want to introduce branes of lower dimensions as probes. this means that we
work in (unphysical) type iib string theory with n d9-branes on r6  t 4. tadpole,
anomaly and other sickness of the theory do not aect our argument which we are going
to make. we could also work in the barely physical case of p = 4 in which most of our
argument can be repeated, although it is less convenient compared to p = 5.

2.1 nahm transform as t-duality

probing by a d1-brane

let us rst probe this d9-brane system by a d1-brane which spans the coordinates
x0,9, or x = x0  x9. the analysis of lowlying spectrum of open strings ending on this
probe (in the case where t 4 is large) is the same as the one for a d1-brane in type i
string theory [18] except that we do not impose invariance under worldsheet orientation
reversal. the theory on the probe is a u(1) gauge theory in 1 + 1 dimensions with at
most (0, 8) supersymmetry. it has an (8, 8) u(1) vector multiplet whose scalar components
take values in r4  t 4 and also a positive-chirality fermion  with u(1) charge 1 which
transforms in the fundamental representation of the avor group u(n). the fermion  is
coupled to the u(n) gauge eld adx on the d9-branes via the minimal coupling

(cid:16)  + x a(x)  ia(cid:17) 

(2.2)

where iadx is the u(1) gauge eld and x  are the scalar elds in the u(1) vector
multiplet representing the position of the probe in t 4. if the gauge eld a is at, the
theory preserves the (0, 8) supersymmetry (generated by those  with 01 = 1) but if
it is in an instanton conguration with self-dual curvature, f 
 = 0, the supersymmetry
is broken to (0, 4) (generated by those  with 09 = 1234 = 1). for a nite size
torus, there are actually innitely many additional modes coming from the strings winding
around 1-cycles of t 4, but the eect of them is small when the size of t 4 is large and they
simply decouple in the low energy limit.

probing by a wrapped d5-brane

next, let us probe the d9-brane system by a d5-brane wrapped on t 4 and spanning the
x0,9 or x directions. the analysis of low-lying modes on the d5-brane is almost identical
to that in [19]. the theory of these modes is a u(1) gauge theory in 5 + 1 dimensions
with at most (1, 0) supersymmetry.
it has a (1, 1) u(1) vector multiplet and a (1, 0)

4

hypermultiplet with u(1) charge 1 which transforms in the fundamental representation
of the avor group u(n). the avor group u(n) has a background gauge eld which
is given by the gauge eld adx of the d9-brane. namely, the hypermultiplet elds 
scalars q ( = 1, 2) and a negative chirality spinor   are minimally coupled to a
via

where d =   ia and

k dqk2 +  d/  ,

d =  + a  ia ,

(2.3)

(2.4)

in which iadx +iadx is the u(1) gauge eld of the probe. when the u(n) gauge eld
adx is at, the theory preserves the (1, 0) supersymmetry but if it is in an instanton
conguration on t 4 with self-dual curvature f 
 = 0, the supersymmetry is broken to
half  only those with positive-chirality in t 4 (as well as in r2  t 4) is unbroken. we
shall consider the case where the instanton number is k, namely a is a gauge eld
that denes a connection of a rank n complex vector bundle e over t 4 with the second
chern character ch2(e) = k. then, the wrapped d5-brane is probing a bound state of n
d9-branes wrapped on t 4 and k d5-branes at points in t 4.

when the size of t 4 becomes small, it is natural to consider the theory of the wrapped
d5-brane probe as 1 + 1 dimensional theory with a tower of innite kaluza-klein modes.
the theory is invariant under (0, 4) supersymmetry which is generated by those  with
09 = 1234 = 1. at long distances, massive modes simply decouple and only nitely
many massless modes remain in the theory. from the six-dimensional (1, 1) u(1) vector
multiplet, we obtain (0, 4) multiplets whose bosonic elds are the u(1) gauge eld a
together with the scalar elds taking values in the space of solutions to the equations

x p = 0,
a  a = 0,

(2.5)

(2.6)

where x p (p = 5, 6, 7, 8) are the scalar component of the (1, 1) vector multiplet. the
solution space for the rst equation is r4 since it is solved by x p = constant. the second
equation is the equation for iadx to be a at u(1) connection over t 4. since we have
a u(1) gauge symmetry, what we actually obtain as the target space is the moduli space
of at u(1) connections. a at u(1) gauge eld can have a = constant, and a is gauge
equivalent to a + n where n belongs to the dual lattice 2 of /2 so that the gauge
transformation g(x) = einx is single valued on t 4. the moduli space is therefore the

vector multiplet, we obtain a 1 + 1 dimensional (8, 8) u(1) vector multiplet whose scalar

dual torus bt 4 = {a}/{n} = (r4)/2. thus, from the six-dimensional (1,1) u(1)
components take values in r4  bt 4.

5

massless elds in 1 + 1 dimensions also come from the hypermultiplet in the bifunda-
mental representation and these break the supersymmetry to (0, 4). they correspond to
the elds on t 4 satisfying

dq = 0,

d = 0 ,

(2.7)

where d is given by (2.4). for a generic instanton conguration, there is no covariantly
constant section of the associated bundle in the fundamental representation. therefore,
there is no solution to dq = 0. in this case, there is neither positive-chirality dirac zero
mode since such a thing, if existed, would be covariantly constant in a self-dual instanton
background as one can see from the weizenbock formula d/ d/ = dd f. however,
as the index theorem shows, there are k dirac zero modes with negative chirality (see
section 4). let us choose a family of orthonormal basis 1(a), . . . , k(a) of the space of
zero modes which varies smoothly as a is varied. let us expand the eld  as

(x, x) =

kxi=1

i(a(x))(x)  i(x),

(2.8)

where i are positive chirality spinors in 1 + 1 dimensions (positive because  and i(a)
are negative in 5 + 1 and 4-dimensions respectively). inserting this in the lagrangian (2.3)
and integrating over t 4, we obtain a lagrangian for  = (i)

where

(cid:16)  + a a(a)  ia(cid:17) ,
a(a)j =zt 4

d4x i(a) 
a

j(a).

(2.9)

(2.10)

this a(a) can naturally be considered as a u(k) gauge eld on the parameter space
(r4) = {a} since the choice of orthonormal basis i(a) is arbitrary and can be changed
to other ones. thus, we have obtained from the hypermultiplet a positive chirality fermion
 with a unit u(1) charge which is coupled to the external gauge eld a(a) given by
(2.10). in other words,  takes values in the bundle e of dirac zero modes provided with
the unitary connection a; the bre of e at a  (r4) is the kernel of d/ associated with
d =  + a  ia which is provided with the natural inner product coming from the
integration over t 4. note that the u(1) gauge transformation   einx sends a zero
mode  at a to a zero mode  at a + n dened by (x) = einx(x). thus, e should be
considered as a bundle over (r4)/2 = bt 4 where we identify   . it is clear that

a in (2.10) denes a connection on it.

we see that the 1+1 dimensional theory we obtained is exactly the same as the eective

theory of a d1-brane in type iib string theory on r6  bt 4 which probes d9-branes

supporting the bundle e with connection a.

what is known as the nahm transform [1012]. in particular, the u(k) gauge eld ada

numbers of the bundle e is related to that of e as rank( e) = ch2(e) = k and ch2( e) =

the transform a 7 a of a gauge eld on t 4 to that of its dual bt 4 is nothing but
on bt 4 is actually an instanton with self-dual eld strength bf = bf , as expected from
rank(e) = n. thus, the system of d9-branes wrapped on bt 4 supporting ( e, a) can be
considered as a system of k d9-branes wrapped on bt 4 and n d5-branes at points on bt 4.
fectively the same as the eective theory on a d1-brane moving in r6  bt 4 and probing
dual torus bt 4 given by (2.10) (which represent a system of k d9 and n d5 branes). by
eective theory of the t-dual d1-brane moving in the large bt 4. then, the system of k

d9 and n d5 branes emerged above must be identied as t-dual to the original system
of k d9 and n d5 branes. therefore, what we have seen shows that the the t-duality of
d9-d5 brane system (or other (physical) d(p + 4)-dp brane system with p = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4)

the system of d9-branes which support the gauge eld conguration a(a)da on the

to summarize, we have seen that the theory on the wrapped d5-brane probe is ef-

denition, the eective theory of a d5-brane wrapped on a small t 4 is identied as the

is indeed given by the nahm transform of instantons on t 4 and bt 4.

one important property of t-duality is that if the t-duality is operated twice we get
back in the same string background. it is indeed known as the inversion theorem [11, 12]
a) = (e, a) (see
that the square nahm transform is the identity, (e, a) 7 ( e, a) 7 (
also appendix a for the expression for the isomorphism (

e,

e,

a) = (e, a)).

use of brane probe to study space-time geometry was initiated in [20] and has been an
important method in string theory. the paper [20] considers d9-d5 system in at non-
compact space-time probed by a d1-brane and obtains adhm construction of instantons
on r4 (which is nothing but the s-dual of the heterotic worldsheet theory in [21]). since
nahm-transform is in a sense the adhm construction for four-torus, what we have done
can be considered as a generalization of [20].

2.2 the general case  emergence of brane-anti-brane system

in the above discussion, we have assumed that the dirac operator d/ = (+aia)
has no positive-chirality zero mode at any value of a. in general, however, we encounter
the cases where there are positive-chirality zero modes as well. this includes the simplest
and important example of k = 0 where the connection a is at, a = diag(ia1
, . . . , ian
 ),
in which there are both positive and negative chirality zero modes at a = aj
. in such

a case, the t-dualized system we obtain is not a vector bundle on bt 4 supported by d9-

7

branes, but something else which we now describe.

kaluza-klein modes and interpretation

let us look at the lagrangian for the full kaluza-klein modes from the hypermultiplet
of 5-9 strings. the scalar elds q can be considered as 1+1 dimensional scalar elds q
with values in the innite dimensional vector space (e) of sections of e. likewise, the
fermion  can be considered to consist of 1+1 dimensional spinor elds + and  of
positive and negative chirality respectively which take values in the innite dimensional
vector spaces (s+  e) and (s  e). it is appropriate to consider these vector spaces
of sections of e, s+  e and s  e as innite-dimensional vector bundles e, e + and
e  over bt 4 provided with hermitian metrics and natural connections which we denote by
a, a+ and a respectively: recall that the u(1) gauge symmetry of the probe d5-brane
identies a section (x) at a  (r4) and a section einx(x) at a + n  (r4) of any of the
bundles e, s+e and se. this denes the bundles e, e + and e  over bt 4. since this
and connections of the bundles over bt 4.
note that the components d+ : (s+e)  (se) and d : (se)  (s+
e) of the dirac operator d/ are conjugate to each other and that the weizenbock formula
shows d+d = dd. then, denoting the operator d+ at a as d(a) : e +|a  e |a,
the lagrangian can be written as

identication is unitary and does not involve a explicitly, the hermitian products and
the trivial connections of the trivial bundles over (r4) descends to hermitian products

x=1,2 xu=0,9(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:16)u + uaa(a)  iau(cid:17)q(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

(2.11)

we interpret (2.11) as the lagrangian for a d1-brane probing some bound state of innitely

many d9-brane and anti-d9-branes wrapped on bt 4 of the t-dualized system. this is based

on the following consideration.

if there are n d9-branes and a d1-brane, the 1-9 strings creates a positive-chirality
fermion on the 1+1 dimensional worldvolume of the d1-brane which is charged under the
bifundamental representation of u(n)  u(1). similarly, if there are n anti-d9-brane and
a d1-brane, the 1-9 strings create a negative chirality fermion in the bifundamental of
u(n)  u(1). if there are n d9-brane and n anti-d9-branes, the analysis of open strings
shows that, in addition to the u(n)u(n) gauge elds created by 9-9 and 9-9 strings, there

8

are tachyonic modes created by 9-9 strings which are charged under u(n)  u(n) as the
bifundamentals (n, n) and (n, n). (in this paper, we denote the dual of a representation
v by v .) therefore, the conguration without the tachyon expectation value is unstable
and is expected to roll down toward a minimum of the tachyon potential. since we do
not have a correct decription of some stable bound state of a brane-anti-brane system,
we do not precisely know what happends for the theory on a d1-brane probing such a
system. however, we may expect that the low-lying spectrum is not very much dierent
from the simple superposition of those for the 1-9 system and those for the 1-9 system.
in particular, there will be positive and negative chirality fermions in (n, 1,1) and
(1, n,1) of u(n) u(n) u(1) respectively (and their duals). we may also expect that
the tachyon vev will provide a mass term in the theory of d1-brane which couples the
positive and negative chirality fermions created by the 1-9 and 1-9 strings. if it is the
case, when the tachyon vev is non-zero the coupled fermions are irrelevant in the infra-red.
this is consistent with the expectation that a d-brane and an anti-d-brane will annihilate
via the tachyon condensation.

now, part of the interpretation of (2.11) is clear. the fermion + is interpreted as
the collection of fermions created by the 1-9 strings in the n   limit, whereas  is
interpreted as those created by 1-9 strings in the n   limit. the connections a+ of
e + and a of e  are the connections of the chan-paton bundles supported by the d9
and anti-d9-branes respectively. the operators d : e +  e  and d : e   e + are
interpreted as the tachyon elds.

however, it is not obvious how to interpret the scalar elds q which become massless
at the locus where d(a) has a zero. their charge under the symmetry of the system
suggest that they are created from the 1-9 or 1-9 strings, but the standard analysis shows
that the ns sector of the 1-9 or 1-9 strings has the lowest mass squared = 1
2 and therefore
the corresponding bosons can never become massless. we leave this as an open problem.
in this paper, we consider the existence of q as a consequence of the (0,4) supersymmetry
(required from the supersymmetry of the bound state) which postulates the existence of
the superpartner of the fermions of mass-squared matrix d(a)d(a).

localized degrees of freedom

irrespective of the interpretation as the bound state of d9-branes and anti-d9-branes,
it is clear that the modes with non-zero eigenvalues of the laplace/dirac operators 
d(a)d(a) or d(a)d(a)  are irrelevant in the infra-red limit and can be ignored. when
d(a) has no kernel everywhere on bt 4, we only have to take into account the kernel of d(a),

this multiplet can no longer be ignored at least in a neighborhood of m. in other words

something special happens when d(a) has a non-trivial kernel (and the kernel of
d(a) jumps) at some locus m in bt 4. the mass of some supermultiplet (two complex

and  =  under trivializations s+ = t 4  c2 and s = t 4  c2. there is no kernel
for both d(a) and d(a) everywhere except a = a0. at a = a0, the constant sections of
s+ = t 4  c2 and s = t 4  c2 become the kernels of d(a) and d(a) respectively
and there are nothing else. thus, we only have to look at the spaces e +

constant sections in the vicinity of a = a0. the operator d(a) sends e +
0 and behaves

what these all mean in the 1+1 dimensional theory of the probe is that there are two
complex bosons q
 which are
localized near a = a0. their mass squared behaves as d(a)d(a) = |a  a0|2. note that
0 transforms in the positive spinor representation of so(4) in the x5678 directions while
q

 transforms in the negative and positive spinor representations of so(4) in the
x1234 directions. these are clearly the properties of the 1-5 string in the system of d1-
brane probing the d5-brane located at a = a0. thus, this localized degrees of freedom can

+,  

be identied as the d5-brane at a0  bt 4 of the t-dualized system. this is of course what

is expected from the known relation of the wilson line and the position of the d-branes
under t-duality [1].

the same conclusion can be deduced also in the picture of d9-anti-d9-brane system.
although there are innitely many d9 and anti-d9-branes, we may regularize the system

10

by discarding innite high level modes which are irrelevant in the infra-red limit. one
obvious choice appears to be the one to discard everything but the constant modes.
however, there is a technical diculty. because of the identication of the sections (x)
at a and einx(x) at a+ n, the space of constant sections (dened as e 
0 in a neighborhood
of a0) does not extend as a globally dened nite-dimensional vector bundle over bt 4.
instead of trying to nd a nite-dimensional subbundle of e , we can consider a more
wild but reasonable regularization. since the only relevant information is the behaviour
of the lowest modes in the vicinity of a = a0, we can approximate the innite-dimensional

mukais fourier transform

we have described what we obtain as the t-dualized system in the general case, using
the eective theory on the probe. we have also gave an interpretation as some bound state
of d9-branes and anti-d9-branes. however, we have not described it in a mathematical
language except for the generic case where the kernel of d(a) is constantly zero and

transform called mukais fourier transform [9] which can be considered as a generalization
of the nahm transform.
it is a transform of an object in a category called derived
category of sheaves [22] on an abelian variety x (a complex torus embedded in a projective

space) denoted by d(x) to an object of d(cx) where cx is the dual torus of x (which

is again an abelian variety). the category d(x) includes as its objects holomorphic
vector bundles on x, and for the case where x is four-torus and in a region where
there is a one to one correspondence between holomorphic bundles and (anti-)self-dual
connections, mukais fourier transform agrees with the nahm transform. this suggests
that the correct mathematical language to describe what we have obtained should not be
far from the derived category of sheaves, at least in the case where t 4 has a structure
of an abelian variety. indeed, a general object of d(x) is a complex of sheaves which is
reminiscent of our dirac complex, and also, sheaves can localize on a subvariety of x. it

11

is an interesting problem to nd the precise relation (though we do not attempt to solve
here).

the inverse transform

discussion.

we have started from a connection of a vector bundle on t 4 supported by d9-branes
and obtained, as its t-dual image, an object which is something more general than a
connection of a vector bundle, presumably supported by d9 and anti-d9-branes. then, a
natural question is what happens when t-duality is applied to such an object. to test the
interpretation as the d9-anti-d9 bound state, assuming some property of branes probing
such a system, we consider the t-duality of the object which is obtained as the t-dual
image of our favorite example of k = 0, n = 1 at connection a = ia0
. we must get
back the original at connection. we will work in the nite-dimensional approximation
of d : e +  e  introduced before and will focus our attention to a neigorhood of a = a0,
ignoring the global issue on bt 4 which yields only a subleading modication in the present
thus, our starting point is the two pairs of d9 and anti-d9-branes wrapped on bt 4
supporting the rank-two chan-paton bundles e+ and e and the tachyon eld t : e+ 
e which behaves near a = a0 as (2.14), t (a) = i(a a0). we probe this system by
a d5-brane wrapped on bt 4. as in the case for a d1-brane probing the brane-anti-brane

system, we assume that the low-lying fermionic spectrum on the d5-brane is the same
as the superposition of those for the d5-d9 system and the d5-anti-d9 system. also,
we assume that the tachyon expectation value yields the fermion mass term. thus, the
probe theory has 5+1 dimensional negative and positive chirality fermions with values in
e+ and e which we denote by  and + respectively. the lagrangian for these elds
is

d/  + +d/ ++ + +t  + t +,

(2.15)

where d/  are the 5+1 dimensional dirac operator associated with the covariant deriva-
tives d =   ia and

negative) chirality fermion in 1+1 dimensions.

now let us take a closer look at these equations. we rst recall some facts about
the spinor representations in four-dimensions. let 2 be the spinor representation of
spin(4) = su(2)+  su(2) which are sent to each other by the gamma matrices  :
2+  2 and  : 2  2+. we note that there are isomorphisms  : 2  2
 of
su(2) representations such that  = t+. now, using the metric we identify the
tangent spaces of t 4 and bt 4, and thus we can consider both s and s as the trivial
in particular, the dirac operators on bt 4 can be
bundles with the common bre 2.
respresented as d+ = d and d = d. on the other hand, the bundles e look
like the bundles with bres 2 in the vicinity of a = a0 where the tachyon is given by
t (a) = i(a a0). for convenience, using the isomorphisms , we shall consider e
to have bres 2

 and the tachyon is represented as

t (a) = i t(a  a0).

while the equations on the right have no solution. this is true for any values of x  r4.
note that this solution is single valued as a function of x  t 4 since it obeys the correct

which is dictated by the u(1) gauge symmetry of the probe d5-brane.

thus, we have a single positive-chirality fermion in the eective 1+1 dimensional
theory. this is interpreted as the 1-9 string mode of the d1-brane probing a d9-brane.
since the above solution for (++, ) is single valued and nonwhere vanishing over the
whole space t 4, the chan-paton bundle of the d9-brane is topologically trivial. the
gauge eld on this trivial bundle can be computed as

a(x) =z

when ++ and  are correctly normalized. thus, we have recovered the original at
connection supported by a single d9-brane.

3 orientifold and orbifold

we apply the argument of the previous section to the case where the four-torus is at an
orientifold xed plane or is modded out by z2 orbifold action. we describe the t-duality
in terms of the gauge eld conguration representing the system. this will lead us to
nd a nahm transform for instantons on t 4 with orthogonal/symplectic gauge groups or
on orbifold t 4/z2. here we only consider the generic case where the transformed object
is a vector bundle, and more general case will not be presented since that would be a
repetition of section 2.2. (however, the general case will be included in section 4.)

3.1 d-branes wrapped on z2 orientifold/orbifold of four-torus

as preliminaries, we provide the gauge theory description of d-branes wrapped on z2
orientifold/orbifold of four-torus where z2 acts on the torus via the inversion  the sign
ip of all four at coordinates. (for orientifold, we consider here the case where d-branes
and orientifold-planes are parallel except the four-torus directions.) we apply the method
of [23] to nd the description. similar analysis for orientifold has been done in [24, 25]
and most close one is in [26], while the orbifold case was analyzed in [27, 28].

(i) orientifold of so-type

we rst consider the case of orientifold of so-type. thus, we would like to nd a gauge

theory description of, say, 2k d4-branes in type iia orientifold on r  (bt 4  r5)/z2
which are wrapped on the bt 4 directions. for this, we start with the t-dualized system

14

of 2k d0-branes in type iia orientifold on r  t 4  r5/z2 and perform the fourier
transform as in [23].

if t 4 were r4, the theory on the d0-branes would be the supersymmetric quantum
mechanics with eight supercharges which can be obtained as the dimensional reduction of
four-dimensional n = 2 sp(k) gauge theory with a hypermultiplet in the anti-symmetric
representation. the bosonic elds in such a theory is sp(k) gauge eld a0 (which can
be gauged away), the scalars x p (p = 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) in the adjoint representation, and the
scalars x  ( = 1, 2, 3, 4) in the anti-symmetric representation. the adjoint and anti-
symmetric representation elds, x p and x , can be represented by 2k2k anti-hermitian
and hermitian matrices respectively, both of which obey

jx = xj,

(3.1)

j =

0 1k
1k

0  ,

where x is the complex conjugation of x and 1k is the k  k unit matix.

for t 4 = r4/, we must take into accout the open strings winding around 1-cycles
(and ending on the d0-branes). thus, as in [23], we must replace the sp(k) gauge group
to the symplectic group sp(k||) of innite rank. the bosonic elds in the theory can
be represented by 2k  2k matrices x p
nm parametrized by (n, m)     which
nm, x 
mn = 0, x 
obey x p
nm. there are also
periodicity conditions x p

where x = (x) are coordinates of the dual torus bt 4 = (r4)/2. then, these are

jx p(x) = x p(x)j,
ja(x) = a(x)j.

(3.4)

(3.5)

the sp(k||) gauge transformation is represented as the transformation of the elds
x p(x), a(x) given innitesimally by x p(x) = [x p(x), (x)] and a(x) = [a(x), (x)]+
(x) where (x) is a function on bt 4 which satisfy the same conditions as x p(x). the
supercharges) u(2k) yang-mills theory formulated on r  bt 4. the number of unbroken

lagrangian is the same as the one for the 4+1 dimensional n = 2 supersymmetric (sixteen

supersymmetries are reduced to eight by the constraints (3.4) and (3.5) on the elds.

15

this is the gauge theory description of wrapped d4 branes in the type iia orthogonal-

orientifold on r  (bt 4  r5)/z2. it is obvious how to generalize this to the system of
wrapped d(p + 4)-branes in the type ii orientifold on rp+1  (bt 4  r5p)/z2 with

op-plane of so-type at each of the sixteen xed point.

the conditions (3.4) and (3.5) can be restated in a way which applies also to the case

where the gauge bundle on bt 4 is topologically non-trivial. let e be a u(2k) bundle over bt 4
(a rank 2k complex vector bundle provided with a hermitian bre metric ( , )). the elds
x p(x) and a(x) represent respectively a section x p of the adjoint bundle of e (an anti-
hermitian endomorphism of e) and a unitary connection  of e (a connection preserving
the hermitian metric). now suppose we have a family of anti-liner maps j = (jx) sending
the bre at x to the bre at x:

jx : ex  ex,

such that jxjx = idx

(3.6)

which is isometric in the sense that (jxv, jxw) = (w, v). we shall call such a family j

j can be locally represented by the matrix (jji) in (3.1) as jxei(x) = e

a symplectic structure of e over the inversion x 7 x of bt 4, and such a pair (e, j) a
symplectic orientibundle over the (orthogonal) orientifold bt 4/z2. such anti-linear maps
j(x)jji where
ei is an orthonormal frame of e dened in an open subset of bt 4 and e
j is another one
dened in the inversion image (we shall call such a pair of frames a symplectic frame).
then, the condition (3.4) means that x p commutes with j, jxx p(x) = x p(x)jx, and
the condition (3.5) requires that the connection  preserves the symplectic structure j in
the sense that jxs = (x)js for a (local) section s and a vector eld x on bt 4 where
js is another section dened by jxs(x) = (js)(x) and x is the image of x under the
inversion x 7 x. the gauge transformations are (local) unitary automorphisms of e
which commute with the map j. 1
one can show that a u(2k) bundle on bt 4 with arbitrary instanton number n admits
by |x|   and let bt 4 \ d be the outside region. a u(2k) bundle e of instanton number
n can be constructed by glueing the trivial bundles over d and bt 4 \ d at the boundary
s3 = {|x| = } by a transition function g : s3  u(2k) of winding number n. we dene
the anti-linear map jx : ex  ex over bt 4 \ d as the complex conjugation followed by the

multiplication by the matrix j in (3.1) with respect to the trivialization we started with.
1there is another way to state the conditions: let us dene a bilinear pairing h , i of the bres at x and
x by hvx, wxi = (jvx, wx). then, this is a non-degenerate skew-symmetric form (skew-symmetric
in the sense that hvx, wxi = hwx, vxi). then, the conditions (3.4) and (3.5) means that the gauge
transformations and the connection  should preserve the skew-form h , i.

a symplectic structure over the inversion. let us choose a neighborhood d of x = 0 given

16

at the boundary s3, the matrix to be multiplied is expressed as j(x) = g(x)1jg(x) with
respect to the trivialization that extends over d. we can extend jx to the interior of d if
j(x) can be extended to a function on d satisfying j(x)j(x) = 1 and j(x)j(x) = 1.
let us embed sp(1) in sp(k)  u(2k) via h  sp(1) 7 diag(h, 1, . . . , 1)  sp(k). then,
a map x  s3 = sp(1) 7 xn  sp(1) induces a map g : s3  u(2k) of winding number
n which yields j(x) = (1)n j on s3. thus, jx extends to the interior of d and hence
to all over bt 4, dening a symplectic structure over the inversion.

(ii) orientifold of sp-type

we next consider the case of orientifold of sp-type. we shall nd a gauge theory

description of k d4-branes in type iia orientifold on r(bt 4r5)/z2 which are wrapped
on the bt 4 directions. we start with the t-dualized system of k d0-branes in type iia
orientifold on rt 4r5/z2 and proceed as in the previous case. the dierece is that (in
the case where t 4 is replaced by r4) the gauge group is now o(k) and the hypermultiplet
is in the second rank symmetric tensor representation. the eect is to eliminate the
matrix j in every formula in the previous case.

thus, the theory of d4-branes wrapped on bt 4/z2 orientifold contains bosonic elds
x p(x) (p = 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) and a(x) ( = 1, 2, 3, 4) with values in k  k anti-hermitian
matrices obeying

x p(x) = x p(x),
a(x) = a(x).

(3.7)

(3.8)

the innitesimal gauge transformation parameter (x) obey the same conditions as
x p(x). the lagrangian is the same as the one for 4 + 1 dimensional n = 2 u(k)

super-yang-mills theory on r  bt 4 but the supersymmetries are reduced to eight by

the constarints on the elds.

we restate the conditions (3.7) and (3.8) in a general set up. let e be a u(k) bundle

over bt 4. the elds x p(x) and a(x) represent respectively a section x p of the adjoint
bundle of e and a unitary connection  of e. now suppose we have a family of anti-liner
maps i = (ix) sending the bre at x to the bre at x:

ix : ex  ex,

such that ixix = idx

(3.9)

which is isometric in the sense that (ixv, ixw) = (w, v). we shall call such a family i an

orthogonal structure of e over the inversion x  x of bt 4, and such a pair (e, i) an
orthogonal orientibundle over the (symplectic) orientifold bt 4/z2. such anti-linear maps

17

i can be locally represented as ixei(x) = e

i(x) where ei is an orthonormal frame of e
dened in an open subset of bt 4 and e
j is another one dened in the inversion image (we
shall call such a pair of frames a real frame). then, the condition (3.7) means that x p
commutes with i and the condition (3.8) requires that the connection  preserves the
symplectic structure i (in the similar sense as before). the gauge transformations are
(local) unitary automorphisms of e which commute with the map i. 2

one can show that a u(k) bundle on bt 4 admits an orthogonal structure over the
inversion provided the instanton number is even, say 2n. the construction is as in the
previous case. thus, we only have to show that the function i(x) = g(x)1g(x) on
s3 = {|x| = } extends to a function dened on |x|   obeying i(x)i(x) = 1 and
i(x)i(x) = 1 if g : s3  u(k) is a map of even winding number 2n. let us embed
sp(1) in so(k)  u(k) via h  sp(1) 7 [(h, 1)]  (sp(1)  sp(1))/z2 = so(4) 
so(k). then, a map x  s3 = sp(1) 7 xn  sp(1) induces a map g : s3  u(k) of
winding number 2n. this yields i(x) = (1)n which obviously extends to |x|  . note
that this construction applies only to the case of even instanton numbers (presumably
there is no orthogonal structure over the inversion for odd instanton numbers because of
3(u(k)/o(k)) = z2).

(iii) orbifold

finally, we provide a gauge theory description of d-branes wrapped on the orbifold3
t 4/z2. we consider here 2n d4-branes (the generalization to p > 4 branes is obvious).

we start with type iia string theory on the dual bt 4/z2 with 2n d0-branes at points
of bt 4, and proceed as before following [23]. the bosonic elds in the theory of lowlying
open string modes can be represented by 2n  2n matrices x p
by (n, m)  2  2 which obey the usual conditions x p
x, mn, x p
(n+n)( m+n) = x p
projection amounts to x p

n m, x,n m parametrized
,n m =
n m and x,(n+n)( m+n) = x,n m + (n)n, m12n . the z2 orbifold
n m = x p

n m,  x,n m =  x,n m, where

n m + x p

mn = 0, x 

(3.10)

2a bilinear pairing h , i of the bres at x and x dened by hvx, wxi = (jvx, wx) is a non-degenerate
symmetric form (symmetric in the sense that hvx, wxi = hwx, vxi). then, the conditions (3.7) and
(3.8) means that the gauge transformations and the connection  should preserve the form h , i.

3here, we consider string theory based on the orbifold cft on the worldsheet. when t 4/z2 is
considered as a singular k3-surafce, ns-ns b-eld has period  for each of the sixteen vanishing two-
cycles.

18

here we assumed that the z2 orbifold action on chan-paton factor is in a sum of copies
of the regular representation, but we can relax this condition so that  is an arbitrary
unitary matrix that squares to 1. such matrices are classied by tr  up to similarity
transformation.4 let us put

einxx p

n0,

x p(x) = xn2
a(x) = i xn2

einx x,n0,

(3.11)

(3.12)

where x = (x) are coordinates of the torus t 4. then, these are functions on t 4 with
values in 2n  2n anti-hermitian matrices and satisfy
x p(x) = x p(x),
a(x) = a(x).

(3.13)

(3.14)

the gauge transformation is represented innitesimally by x p(x) = [x p(x), (x)] and
a(x) = [a(x), (x)] + (x) where (x) is a function on t 4 which satisfy the same
conditions as x p(x). the lagrangian is the same as the one for the 4 + 1 dimensional
n = 2 u(2n) super-yang-mills theory on r  t 4, but the number of supersymmetries
are reduced to eight by the constraints on the elds.

we restate the conditions (3.13) and (3.14) in a general set up where the gauge bundle
on t 4 is not necessarily topologically trivial. let e be a u(2k) bundle over t 4. the elds
x p(x) and a(x) represent respectively a section x p of the adjoint bundle and a unitary
connection . now suppose we have a family of linear maps  = (x) sending the bre
at x to the bre at x:

x : ex  ex,

such that xx = idx

(3.15)

which is unitary in the sense that (xv, xw) = (v, w). we shall call such a family  a
lift to e of the inversion x 7 x of t 4, and such a pair (e, ) an orbibundle over the
orbifold t 4/z2.5 then, the condition (3.13) means that x p commutes with  and the
condition (3.14) requires that the connection  preserves  in the usual sense. the gauge
transformations are (local) unitary automorphisms of e which commute with the map
. two lifts of the inversion cannot be equivalent if the traces are dierent at any of the

4if tr  6= 0, there must be a fractional brane stuck at the z2 xed point [8].
5a more standard terminology (after the z2 quotient) is v-bundle over v-manifold. the name orbi-
bundle is due to k. fukaya and k. ono (as far as i know). orientibundle which i introduced in the
previous part of the paper simply follows this terminology.

19

sixteen xed points {xi}. we shall call a lift  traceless if tr xi = 0 at all of the xed
points.

one can show that a u(2n) bundle on t 4 admits a traceless lift of the inversion
provided the instanton number is even, say 2k. as before, we only have to show that the
function (x) = g(x)1g(x) on s3 = {|x| = } extends to |x|   as a function obeying
(x)(x) = 1 and (x)(x) = 1, if g : s3  u(2n) is a map of even winding number
2k. we choose g(x) to be diag(g2(x), 1n 2, g2(x), 1n 2) where g2(x) is a map s3  su(2)
of winding number k such that g2(x) = (1)kg2(x) (it is easy to construct such g2(x):
for example, identify x  s3 as a unit quaternion and put g2(x) = xk  sp(1) = su(2)).
then, (x) is a constant unitary matrix  such that 2 = 12n and tr  = 0, and
therefore extends to |x|  .

3.2 nahm transform as t-duality

we now describe t-duality in terms of the gauge eld conguration representing the
system. we consider t-duality transform of d(p + 4) and dp-branes on t 4 where t 4 is (i)
at the xed plane of orthogonal-orientifold, (ii) at the xed plane of symplectic-orientifold,
and (iii) divided by a z2 orbifold action.

(i) orthogonal bundle  symplectic orientibundle

we rst consider an (unphysical) type i string theory (or equivalently type iib
orientifold of so-type) on r6  t 4 with n d9-branes wrapped on t 4 and 2k d5-branes
at points on t 4.

the d9-branes support an so(n) gauge eld and the d5-branes can be represented
by an so(n) instanton on t 4. an so(n) gauge eld can be considered as a connection of
a u(n) bundle e preserving an orthogonal structure i of e (i.e. anti-linear isometric in-
volutions ix : ex  ex). note that the embedding so(n)  u(n) has index 2, namely,
it maps the generator of 3(so(n)) = z to two times the generator of 3(u(n)) = z.
therefore the 2k d5-branes, which are represented by a 2k-instanton of u(n) group,
correspond to a k-instanton of so(n).

probing by a wrapped d5-brane pair

we probe this system by a pair of d5-branes wrapped on t 4 and spanning the x di-
rections. the theory on the probe is a (1, 0) supersymmetric su(2) gauge theory in 5 + 1

20

dimensions with so(n) avor symmetry where the eight supersymmetries are broken to
half by the instanton conguration of the avor group. the theory has an su(2) vector
multiplet, a singlet hypermultiplet and a half-hypermultiplet in the bifundamental repre-
sentation (n, 2) of so(n)  su(2). the condition of half-hypermultiplet is important
for our purpose and deserves a paragraph of digression as a reminder.

if a hypermultiplet is in a pseudo-real representation of the avorgauge group, one
can impose a half-hypermultiplet condition. let j ab be the skew-form dening the psudo-
reality (so that the representation matrix ga
bj bc in addition to
unitarity), and let  be the invariant tensor of the su(2)r symmetry. then, the half-
hypermultiplet conditions for the hypermultiplet elds (qa, a) are

b satises j abgb

c = ga

qa = j ab q b,
a = j ab(b)c5+1,

(3.16)

(3.17)

where (  )c5+1 is the charge conjugation in 5+1 dimensions. 1 in particular, the fermion
a is a symplectic-majorana-weyl spinor (of negative chirality). indeed, the conditions
(3.16) and (3.17) are invariant under the (1,0) supersymmetry

qa = a,

a = (d/ q)a,

(3.18)

generated by a symplectic-majorana-weyl spinor  =  ( )c5+1 of positive chirality.
in our case, the avorgauge group is so(n)  su(2) and the representation (n, 2)
is indeed pseudo-real; if we denote the su(2)-gauge indices by a, b, . . . and the so(n)-
avor indices by i, j, . . ., the skew-form dening the pseudo-reality is abij. in the present

1in 4n dimensional euclidean or ((4n + 1) + 1) dimensional minkowski space, charge conjugation does
not ip the chirality. the square of charge conjugation is 1 for even n while it is 1 for odd n. the
5 + 1 dimensional spinor representation decomposes to the tensor product of the 4 and 1 + 1 dimensional
spinor representations, and the 5 + 1 dimensional charge conjugation can be represented as the tensor
product of the ones in 4 and 1 + 1 dimensions;

(  )c5+1 = c4  c1+1.

we shall write ( )c for ( )c4 . in the representation where the d = 4 gamma matrices are given by

 = (i~, 1),  = ,

 =  0





0 ! ,

the d = 4 charge conjugation is given by c = c (on both chirality) in which c is a charge conjugation
matrix given by c = i2 and  is the complex conjugation of .

the d = 1 + 1 charge conjugation is simply the complex conjugation c1+1 =  in the representation

where  0 = i2 and  9 = 1 in which  0 9 = diag(1, 1). in this paper, we often denote  by .

21

set-up, the so(n)-avor bundle is topologically non-trivial and the hypermultiplet elds
are sections qa and a of the bundle e and e  s
5+1 is the
5 + 1 dimensional spin bundle of negative chirality. let us dene an antilinear map
i c5+1 : e  s
5+1 as the tensor product of the map i acting on e and the charge
conjugation on s
5+1. then, the conditions of half-hypermultiplet are qa = ab i(q b)
and

5+1 respectively where s

5+1  e  s

a = ab i c5+1(b),

(3.19)

where iq is dened by (iq)(x) = ixq(x) and the denition of i c5+1 is similar.

at long distances, as in the case without orientifold projection, we obtain an eective
1 + 1 dimensional theory with (0, 4) supersymmetry. the su(2) gauge eld on t 4 reduces
to scalar elds taking values in the moduli space of at su(2) connections on t 4. a at
su(2) connection can be represented as a constant gauge eld of the form

asu (2)


= i

a

0

0 a  .

(3.20)

since there are su(2) gauge equivalence relations a  a  a + n (n  2), the
moduli space is (r4)/(2 z2) = bt 4/z2. away from the z2 xed points of bt 4, the
su(2) gauge symmetry is broken to u(1) and we obtain from the su(2) vector multiplet
and the singlet hypermultiplet the 1 + 1 dimensional (0, 4) multiplets whose bosonic
components are u(1) gauge eld ia (embedded in su(2) as asu (2)
= diag(ia,ia))
and scalar elds taking values in r4  bt 4 modulo a z2 action which simultaneously ips
the sign of a and the coordinates of bt 4. at the sixteen z2 xed points, the su(2) gauge

symmetry is restored.



massless elds also come from the half-hypermultiplet in the (n, 2) representation.

they correspond to the elds on t 4 satisfying the equations as (2.7) where now

d =  + aso(n )



 tasu (2)

(3.21)



is the at su(2) gauge eld (3.20) and aso(n )

in which asu (2)
is the so(n) instanton.
namely, they come from the zero modes of the laplace and the dirac operators on t 4
associated with d(a)
 ia. generically, there are nothing else than 2k
negative-chirality zero modes for each of d/ (a) and d/ (a). as in the previous section, we
expand the eld a by the orthonormal basis i(a) (i = 1, . . . , 2k) of the space of zero
modes of d/ (a) as

where a(a)da is the u(2k) gauge eld on bt 4 (dened as in (2.10)) dening a connection

of the bundle e of d/ (a) zero modes. the bundle e has instanton number n and a =
a(a)da has a self-dual curvature.

the half-hypermultiplet condition constrains the fermions a. we rst note that the
operator i c5+1 induces in the t 4 factor a map sending d/ (a) zero modes to d/ (a) zero
modes and vice versa. let i c : e  s  e  s be the tensor product map of i on
e and the charge conjugation on the spinor bundle s on t 4. with respect to a (local)
real-orthonormal frame of e, i c is represented simply as the charge conjugation. since
aso(n )
is represented by real anti-symmetric matrices in such a frame, the eect of i c
on the dirac equation ( + aso(n )
 ia) = 0 is simply to change the sign of a.
namely, if  is a zero mode of d/ (a), then i c (dened as (i c)(x) = i c
x(x)) is a zero
mode of d/ (a). thus, i ci (a) can be spanned by i (a)s
j (a)j j i

then, the half-hypermultiplet condition 2 = i c5+11 requires that

(3.25)

the anti-linear map ja : ea  ea induced by  7 i c denes a symplectic structure

charge conjugation in euclidean four dimension, and it is isometric since (i c1)i c2 =

which support the symplectic orientibundle ( e, j) with the connection a. in fact, the
condition (3.25) is nothing but the orientifold projection on 1-9 open string modes. by
denition, this theory must be identifed as the eective theory of the d1-brane pair

23

which is t-dual to the original d5-brane pair. thus, we conclude that the t-duality
mapping d9 and d5 branes in type i string theory on r6  t 4 to d9 and d5 branes
in type iib orientifold on r6  bt 4/z2 is represented by the transform (e, aso(n ), i) 7
orientibundle on bt 4/z2 of rank 2k.

( e, a, j) of so(n) instantons on t 4 of instanton number k to n-instantons in symplectic

the inverse transform

the transform (e, aso(n ), i) 7 ( e, a, j) may be considered as a generalization of
nahm transform to the case of orthogonal bundles. to fully establish this, we should
provide the inverse transform. thus, we consider d9-branes wrapped on the orthogonal

orientifold bt 4/z2 supporting a rank 2k symplectic orientibundle (e, a, j) of instanton

number n, and probe this by a wrapped d5-brane.

the theory of lowlying modes on the probe d5-brane can be analyzed in the same

way as we have done for wrapped d4-branes in orientifold on r  (bt 4  r5)/z2. it is
a 5 + 1 dimensional (1, 0) supersymmetric u(1) gauge theory on r2  bt 4 with u(2k)

avor symmetry where the eight supersymmetries are broken to half by constraints on
the elds (written below) and by the instanton conguration adx of the avor group.
the theory containes a u(1) vector multiplet, a free hypermultiplet and a hypermultiplet
in the bifundamental representation (2k,1) of u(2k)u(1). the bosonic elds x p from
the free hypermultiplet and the u(1) gauge eld ia (and their superpartners) are subject
to the constraints

x p(x) = x p(x),
a(x) = a(x), a(x) = a(x),

(3.27)

(3.28)

and the u(1) gauge transformations are also constrained as g(x) = g(x)1. the hyper-
multiplet in the bifundamental (2k,1), which consists of sections q and  of e and
e  s

5+1, is subject to the half-hypermultiplet conditions: q =  jq and

 = j c5+1,

(3.29)

where jq and j c5+1 are dened respectively by (jq)(x) = jxq(x) and (j c5+1)(x) =
1234j c5+1
x (x) (multiplication by 1234 represents a lift of the inversion of bt 4 to the spin
bundle). these conditions are invariant under the supersymmetry (3.18) generated by the
symplectic-majorana-weyl spinor  which is of positive-chirality also in four dimensions
1234 = .

24

the kaluza-klein reduction on bt 4 leads to a 1 + 1 dimensional (0, 4) supersymmetric
theory. the gauge symmetry reduces from u(1) to z2 since g = 1 are the only gauge
transformations that are constant along bt 4 satisfying the constraint. the vector and
the free hypermultiplets reduce to z2-singlet (0, 4) multiplets whose bosonic components
are scalar elds taking values in r4  t 4 where t 4 appears here as the moduli space of
(constrained) at u(1) connections ixdx on bt 4. the hypermultiplet in (2k,1) leads
to z2-nonsinglet positive-chirality fermions i with values in the bundle e of zero modes
of the dirac operator associated with the covariant derivative d =  + a  ix. the
bundle e has rank n and instanton number 2k. the fermions i are coupled to the dual
connection a(x)j of e constructed as before, and are constrained as below.

let j c : e  s  e  s be the anti-linear map covering the inversion of bt 4 dened
as the tensor product of the map j : e  e and the charge conjugation followed by
the 1234-multiplication on the spinor bundle s of bt 4 (the latter map is an antilinear
lift of the inversion of bt 4 to s). in a (local) symplectic frame of e, it is represented as
the charge conjugation followed by the multiplication by 1234 and the matrix j given
in (3.1). then, the dirac equation ( + a(x)  ix)(x) = 0 is transformed to
( + ja(x)j 1 + ix)1234jc(x) = 0. in the symplectic frame, the gauge eld a(x)
satises (3.5); ja(x)j 1 = a(x). thus, we see that j c (dened as (j c)(x) =
j c
x(x)) is a d/ zero mode, if  is. if i (i = 1, . . . , n) are orthonormal basis of the
space of d/ zero modes, j ci can be spanned by js

j ci = j i ji
x .

(3.30)

then, the condition (3.29) constrains the fermions i (associated with the base i) as

i = i ij

x j.

(3.31)

the anti-linear map ix : ex  ex induced by  7 j c denes an orthogonal structure
of e. indeed, it is an involution i 2 = 1 because cc =  and jj = 1, and also it is
an isometry, r j c
21. it is easy to see that the dual gauge eld a preserves
this. thus, we have an so(n) bundle ( e, i) with an so(n) connection a.

1j c2 =r 

the eective theory we have obtained is exactly the same as the eective theory
of a d1-brane probing the system of n d9-branes in type i string theory on r6 
t 4 which support the so(n) bundle ( e, i) and the connection a.
indeed, a type i
d1-brane has a z2 gauge symmetry [18] and also, (3.31) is nothing but the orientifold
projection on 1-9 string modes in such a system. thus, we can conclude that the t-

duality mapping the d9-d5 system in type iib orientifold on r6  bt 4/z2 to the d9-d5
system in type i on r6  t 4 is represented by the transform (e, a, j) 7 ( e, a, i) of

25

the gauge eld congurations. since t-duality squares to the identity, the transforms
(e, a, i)  ( e, a, j) and (e, a, j) 7 ( e, a, i) must be inverse of each other. this can
indeed be shown explicitly (see appendix).

summary

we have constructed a nahm transform which is a correspondence of instantons of
orthogonal bundle on t 4 and instantons of symplectic orientibundle on the orthogonal

to the symplectic orientibundle of rank 2k and instanton number n. by construction,

we next consider an (unphysical) type iib string theory with sp-type o9-plane on

r6  t 4 with 2n d9-branes wrapped on t 4 and k d5-branes at points on t 4.

the d9-branes support an sp(n) gauge eld which can be considered as a connection
of a u(2n) bundle e preserving a symplectic structure j of e (i.e. anti-linear isometries
jx : ex  ex such that j 2
x = idx). since the embedding sp(n)  u(2n) has index
one, the k d5-branes correspond to a k-instanton of sp(n) on t 4.

probing by a wrapped d5-brane pair

we probe the system by a pair of wrapped d5-branes as before. the theory on the
probe is a (1, 0) supersymmetric o(2) gauge theory in 5 + 1 dimensions with sp(n) avor
symmetry where the supersymmetries are broken to half by the instanton conguration of
the avor group. the theory has an o(2) vector multiplet, a hypermultiplet in the second
rank symmetric tensor representation, and a half-hypermultiplet in the bifundamental
representation (2n, 2) of sp(n)o(2). the conditions of half-hypermultiplet are qa =
 jq a and a = j c5+1a where a, b = 1, 2 are o(2) gauge indices, qa and a are the
hypermultiplet elds which are sections of the bundle e and e  s
5+1 respectively, and
jq and j c5+1 are dened as before.

at long distances, we obtain an eective 1 + 1 dimensional theory with (0, 4) super-
symmetry. the o(2) gauge eld on t 4 reduces to scalar elds taking values in the moduli
space of at o(2) connections on t 4. a at o(2) connection can be represented with re-

26

in the corresponding dual basis) as a constant eld

since there are o(2) gauge equivalence relations a  a  a + n (n  2), the
moduli space is bt 4/z2. away from the z2 xed point, the gauge symmetry is broken to
and scalar elds taking values in r4  bt 4 (with their
bt 4 (and their superpartners). at the sixteen xed points, the o(2) gauge symmetry is

restored and a new branch r4/z2 develops.

and the coordinates of





massless elds also come from the half-hypermultiplet in the (2n, 2) representation.

 ia. generically there are nothing else than k dirac zero modes
of negative-chirality. we expand  = 1  i2 by the orthonormal basis i(a) (i =
1, . . . , k) of the space of d/ (a) zero modes as  = p i(a)  i where  = (i)

where a(a)da is the u(k) connection of the bundle e over bt 4 of d/ (a) zero modes dened

curvature.

the half-hypermultiplet condition  = j c5+1 constrains . let j c : e  s 
e  s be the tensor product map of j : e  e and the charge conjugation on the spinor
bundle s on t 4. with respect to a (local) symplectic frame of e, j c is represented by
the charge conjugation followed by the multiplication by the 2n  2n matrix j as (3.1)
under which the dirac equation ( + asp(n )
 ia) = 0 is transformed to ( +

(3.35)

(3.36)

the anti-linear map ia : ea  ea induced by  7 j c denes an orthogonal
structure over the inversion of bt 4. indeed, it squares to iaia = 1 because cc =  and
jj = 1, and is isometric since (j c1)j c2 = 
a preserves i. thus, we have an orthogonal orientibundle ( e, i) with a connection a.

21. it is easy to see that the connection

the theory we have obtained is the same as the eective theory on a d1-brane pair

probing the system of k d9-branes in type iib symplectic-orientifold on r6  bt 4/z2

which support the orthogonal orientibundle ( e, i) with the connection a. in fact, the
condition (3.36) is nothing but the orientifold projection on 1-9 string modes. thus, we
conclude that the t-duality mapping the d9-d5 system in type iib symplectic-orientifold

on r6  t 4 to the d9-d5 system in type iib symplectic-orientifold on r6  bt 4/z2 is
represented by the transform (e, asp(n ), j) 7 ( e, a, i) of sp(n) instantons on t 4 of
instanton number k to 2n-instantons in orthogonal orientibundle on bt 4/z2 of rank k.

the inverse transform

to nd the inverse transform, we consider d9-branes wrapped on the symplectic ori-

entifold bt 4/z2 supporting an orthogonal orientibundle (e, a, i) of rank k and instanton

number 2n, and probe it by a wrapped d5-brane pair.

the theory on the probe is a 5+1 dimensional (1, 0) supersymmetric u(2) gauge theory

on r2bt 4 with u(k) avor symmetry where the eight supersymmetries are broken to half
by constraints on the elds (written below) and by the instanton conguration adx of
the avor group. the theory containes a u(2) vector multiplet, an adjoint hypermultiplet
and a hypermultiplet in the bifundamental representation (k, 2) of u(k)  u(2). the
bosonic elds x p from the adjoint hypermultiplet and the u(2) gauge eld au (2) (and
their superpartners) are subject to the constraints

where iq and i c5+1 are dened by (iq)(x) = ixq(x) and i c5+1(x) = 1234i c5+1

these conditions are invariant under the supersymmetry (3.18) generated by the symplectic-
majorana-weyl spinor  which is positive also in four dimensions 1234 = .



theory. the u(2) gauge symmetry reduces to su(2), since gauge transformations and
the gauge eld au (2)
components of the gauge eld reduces to the scalar elds with values in the moduli space

of at u(2) connection on bt 4 subject to the constraint (3.38). such a at connection
can be expressed as a
u (2) = ix12 where x are parameters, and the moduli space is
t 4 because there are gauge equivalence relations x  x + n (n  ). the form
of a
u (2) shows that these scalar elds are su(2) singlets. the adjoint hypermultiplet
subject to (3.37) similarly reduces to su(2) singlet free scalar multiplet with values in r4.
the bifundamental hypermultiplet reduces to su(2)-doublet positive-chirality-fermions
ai with values in the bundle e over t 4 of zero modes of the dirac operator associated
with the covariant derivative d = +aix. the bundle e has rank 2n and instanton
number k. the fermions ai are coupled to the dual connection aj of e constructed as
before, and are constrained as described below.

let i c : e  s  e  s be the anti-linear map over the inversion of bt 4 dened
as the tensor product of the map i : e  e and the charge conjugation followed by
the 1234-multiplication on the spinor bundle s. in a (local) real orthogonal frame of e,
it is simply represented as the charge conjugation followed by the 1234-multiplication.
this transforms the dirac equation ( + a(x)  ix)(x) = 0 to ( + a(x) +
ix)1234c(x) = 0. in the real orthogonal frame, the gauge eld a(x) satises (3.8);
a(x) = a(x). thus, we see that i c (dened as (i c)(x) = i c
x(x)) is a d/ zero
mode, if  is. if i (i = 1, . . . , 2n) are orthonormal frame of the space of d/ zero modes,
i ci can be spanned by js

i ci = j j ji

(3.40)

then, the condition (3.39) constrains the fermions ai (associated with the basis i) as

ai = ab j ij

21. it is easy to see that the dual gauge eld a preserves j. thus, we have an sp(n)

bundle ( e, j) over t 4 with an sp(n) connection a.

the eective theory we have obtained is the same as the eective theory of a d1-
brane probing the system of d9-branes in type ii symplectic orientifold which support
the sp(n) bundle ( e, a, j) on t 4. indeed, (3.41) is nothing but the orientifold projection
on 1-9 string modes. thus, we conclude that the t-duality mapping the d9-d5 system in

orientifold bt 4/z2 to the d9-d5 system in orientifold on t 4 is represented by the transform
(e, a, i) 7 ( e, a, j) of the gauge eld congurations. since t-duality squares to the
identity, the transforms (e, a, j) 7 ( e, a, i) and (e, a, i) 7 ( e, a, j) must be inverse
of each other. this can indeed be shown explicitly (see appendix).

summary

we have constructed a nahm transform which is a correspondence of instantons of
symplectic bundle on t 4 and instantons of orthogonal orientibundle on the symplectic

to the orthogonal orientibundle of rank k and instanton number 2n. by construction,
the t-duality between the d9-d5 system of type iib symplectic orientifold on t 4 and

orientifold bt 4/z2. the symplectic bundle of rank 2n and instanton number k correspond
the d9-d5 system of type iib symplectic orientifold on bt 4/z2 is given by this nahm

transform.

(iii) orbibundle

as the nal example, we consider type iib string theory on orbifold r6  t 4/z2 with
2n d9-branes wrapped on t 4/z2 and k d5-branes at points on t 4/z2. this system is
represented by a rank 2n orbibundle (e, ) on t 4/z2 of instanton number 2k with a
self-dual connection a.

probing by a wrapped d5-brane pair

we probe the system by a pair of d5-branes wrapped on t 4/z2. the theory of
lowlying modes on the probe can be analyzed in the same way as before. it is a 5 + 1
dimensional (1, 0) supersymmetric u(2) gauge theory on r2  t 4 with u(2n) avor
symmetry where the eight supersymmetries are broken to half by constraints on the elds
(written below) and by the instanton conguration adx of the avor group. the theory
containes a u(2) vector multiplet, an adjoint hypermultiplet and a hypermultiplet in the
bifundamental representation (2n, 2) of u(2n)  u(2). the bosonic elds x p from

30

the adjoint hypermultiplet and the u(2) gauge eld au (2) (and their superpartners) are
subject to the constraints

x p(x) = x p(x),
au (2)
(x) = au (2)




(x), au (2)

 (x) = au (2)

 (x),

(3.42)

(3.43)

where  is a 2  2 matrix as  in (3.10). the gauge transformations are also subject
to the constraint g(x) = g(x). the hypermultiplet elds in (2n, 2), the sections
qa and a of e and e  s
5+1 (a = 1, 2 are u(2) gauge indices), are subject to the
half-hypermultiplet conditions: qa = a

bqb and

a = a

bb,

(3.44)

where q and  are dened respectively by (q)(x) = xq(x) and ()(x) =
1234x(x). these conditions are invariant under the supersymmetry (3.18) generated
by the symplectic-majorana-weyl spinor  which is positive also in four dimensions
1234 = .

at long distances, we obtain an eective 1+1 dimensional theory with (0, 4) super-
symmetry. note that the gauge transformations and the  component of the gauge eld
that are constant along bt 4 are in the u(1)  u(1) subgroup dened by the embedding

(3.45)

(eis, eit) 7

2

eis + eit eis + eit
eis + eit

eis + eit  .

thus, the eective theory has u(1)u(1) gauge symmetry with the gauge eld au (1)u (1)
.
the t 4 components of the gauge eld reduces to scalar elds taking values in the moduli
space of at u(2) connections on t 4 subject to the constraint (3.43). such a at u(2)
connection can be expressed as a constant gauge eld of the form



au (2)

 = i

a

0

0 a  .

(3.46)

since there are (constrained) u(2) gauge equivalence relations a  a  a + n
(n  2), the moduli space is bt 4/z2. the adjoint hypermultiplet reduces to scalar
multiplet taking values in the adjoint representation of the u(1)  u(1) subgroup. away
from the z2 xed point of t 4, the gauge group u(1)  u(1) is broken to its diagonal
subgroup u(1), and we obtain (0,4) supersymmetric u(1) gauge theory which has singlet
scalar elds taking values in r4  bt 4/z2. at each of the xed points, u(1)  u(1) is

unbroken and a new branch develops.

31

in any of these branches, massless elds also come from the half-hypermultiplet in
the (2n, 2) representation. they correspond to the elds on t 4 satisfying the equations
as (2.7) where now

d =  + a  tau (2)



,

(3.47)



in which au (2)
is the at u(2) gauge eld (3.46). namely, they come from the zero modes
of the laplace and the dirac operators on t 4 associated with d(a)
=  + a  ia.
generically, there are nothing else than 2k negative-chirality zero modes for each of d/ (a)
and d/ (a). let us expand the fermion a by the orthonormal base i(a) of the space
of d/ (a) zero modes as



1 =xi

i(a)  1i, 2 =xi

i(a)  2i,

(3.48)

where a = (ai) are 1 + 1 dimensional positive-chirality fermions. the lagrangian for a
then becomes

where a(a)da is the u(2k) connection of the bundle e over bt 2 of d/ (a) zero modes

dened as before. the bundle e have instanton number 2n and a = a(a)da has a
self-dual curvature.

the fermions a are constrained due to the half-hypermultiplet condition for a. it
is easy to see that, if  is a zero mode of d/ (a), then  (dened by ()(x) = x(x))
is a zero mode of d/ (a). in particular i(a) can be spanned by j(a):

then, the half-hypermultiplet condition requires

a d1-brane probing the system of 2k d9-branes on orbifold bt 4/z2 which support the

orbibundle ( e, a, ). indeed, (3.51) is nothing but the orientifold projection on 1-9 string
modes. thus, we can conclude that the t-duality mapping the d9-d5 system on orbifold

the eective theory we have obtained is exactly the same as the eective theory of

32

t 4/z2 to the d9-d5 system on the dual orbifold bt 4/z2 is represented by the transform
(e, a, ) 7 ( e, a, ) of the gauge eld congurations. since t-duality squares to the
identity, the square of this transform must be identity. this can indeed be shown explicitly
(see appendix).

4 reduction to topology

recently, it was argued by witten that d-brane charges take values in k-theory groups
of the space-time [14]. since t-duality is an equivalence of string theories which sends
d-branes to d-branes, (if the identication of d-brane charge as k-theory element is
valid for any size of the space-time) it should induce an isomorphism of relevent k-theory
groups. one is then interested in what this isomorphism is in general. in this section, we
determine this for t-duality on four-torus by reducing to topology the nahm transforms
obtained in the previous sections. this serves as a warm-up for the next section where
we will determine the isomorphisms for tori of other dimensions.

4.1 d-branes, k-theory, and index theory

the basic assumption behind the identication of k-groups as d-brane charges [14]
is that a dp-brane and an anti-dp-branes can annihilate by condensation of the tachyon
eld.1 d-branes located at a submanifold w of the space-time support a complex vector
bundle e on w with a connection. likewise anti-d-branes at w support another vector
bundle f with a connection. the tachyon eld is a complex linear t : e  f (and its
conjugate t  : f  e). if t is everywhere at the minimum of the tachyon potential and
hence is an isomorphism, then the system is considered to be equivalent to the vacuum;
i.e.
if e and f are isomorphic, the branes and anti-branes will annihilate. the set of
pairs (e, f ) modulo an equivalence relation (e, f )  (e, f ) when there are h and h 
such that (e  h, f  h)  (e  h , f   h ) forms the k-theory group k(w ).

we have actually experienced in section 2 a phenomenon analogous to brane-anti-brane
annihilation; it is the decoupling of brane-anti-brane pairs in the infra-red limit of the
probe theory. we considered a vector bundle e on t 4 supported by d9-branes and probed

1the tachyon is created by stretched strings and its condensation breaks the o-diagonal u (1) subgroup
of u (1)u (1). there has been a puzzle about the fate of diagonal u (1) which appears to remain unbroken.
however, it can disappear by connement, namely, by condensation of the magnetic tachyon which is
created by stretched (anti-)d(p  2)-branes and is charged under the (p  2)-form potential dual to the
diagonal u (1). see [29] for some of the details. in the present context, these are simply invisible sectors
and will not be mentioned.

33

the system with a d5-brane wrapped on t 4. the eective theory on the d5-brane, which
is a 1+1 dimensional theory with a tower of kaluza-klein modes, can be identied with
the eective theory of a d1-brane probing the t-dualized system. the innite kaluza-
klein modes from the 5-9 hypermultiplet are interpreted as the strings stretched between
the d1-brane and innitely-many d9 or anti-d9-branes of the t-dualized system. the
fermion masses come from the dirac operators on t 4 and are interpreted as the tachyon
vevs of innite d9 anti-d9 pairs. massive modes are irrelevant at long distances and
can be simply ignored. we can interpret this as the pair annihilation of the d9 and
anti-d9-branes via tachyon condensation.

now, as in [14], we can associate to this system of d9 and anti-d9-branes an element
of an appropriate k-theory group which can be considered as the d-brane charge of the
t-dualized system. let e + and e  be the spaces of sections of negative and positive-
chirality spinor bundles on t 4 coupled to e, as in section 2. the dirac operator d/
denes a complex linear map d : e +  e  and its conjugate d : e   e +. the
spaces e + and e  together with the operator d are parametrized by a  bt 4 and are
considered as bundles over bt 4 and a map between them. we have interpreted them as
the bundles supported by the d9 and the anti-d9-branes and the tachyon eld of the
t-dualized system. thus, the desired element of a k-theory group is (e +,e ) which
belongs to k(bt 4).
one may wonder whether the fact that the bundles e + and e  are innite-dimensional
causes some trouble. however, since the massive modes are irrelevant (or since brane-
anti-brane pair can annihilate via tachyon condensation), we can throw away the higher
level modes and reduce the problem to nite dimension. let us decompose e + and e 
as e + = e +
(i = 0, 1),
e +
0 and e 
is an isomorphism. locally such
a decomposition always exists as one can see, say, by taking the spectral decomposition
and dening e +
1 as the modes whose dirac eigenvalues do not vanish. if we could
take such a decomposition globally on bt 4, we would be able to regularize (e +,e ) by
0 ) dening an element of k(bt 4). such a global decomposition does not always
(e +
0 ,e 
exist, but we can glue the local decompositions to obtain an element of k(bt 4) which
restricts locally to (e +
denes [57] as the index of d : e +  e .
2here is the construction: collecting the spaces e 
a nite-dimensional vector bundle v over bt 4 with a map f : v  e  such that d  f : e +  v  e 
is surjective everywhere. the kernel of d  f has a constant rank and denes a vector bundle over bt 4.

the operator d : e +  e  is dened as the dirac operator d+ : (s+)  (s)
coupled to the family of connections a  ia over t 4 parametrized by a  bt 4. its index
actually depends only on the topology of the bundle v on t 4  bt 4 which carries this
family of connections (i.e. the bundle which has a connection which restricts on t 4 {a}
to the connection a  ia). the index can therefore be denoted as ind (d+,v). thus,
we need to nd out what v is.

the poincare bundle

the u(1) connection   ia on t 4 is equivalent to   i(a + n) for n  2
under the gauge transformation einx. also, we recall from section 2 that the u(1) gauge
symmetry of the probe d5-brane implies that the section (x) of s  e at a  (r4)
should be identied as the section einx(x) at a + n  (r4). these motivate us to dene
a complex line bundle p over t 4 bt 4 as the quotient of the trivial bundle t 4  (r4)  c

by the action of the lattice 2 given by

n : (x, a, c) 7 (x, a + n, einxc).

(4.1)

we call this the poincare bundle. the gauge potential iadx on t 4 (r4) is invariant
under the transformation (4.1) and denes a connection  of p that restricts on t 4 {a}
to the at connection   ia of the trivial bundle. when restricted to {x}  bt 4, the
connection  yields a at connection on bt 4 which is equivalent to /a + ix. however,
 is not at over t 4  bt 4 and has a curvature d with a rst chern class

image under the embedding of the integral to the real cohomology of the torus).

where i and bi are basis of h 1(t 4, z) and h 1(bt 4, z) respectively (more precisely, their
the isomorphism k(t 4) = k(bt 4)
the tensor product e p has a connection a 1 + 1  that restricts on t 4{a} to
the connection a  ia. also, e + and e  are vector bundles whose bres at a  bt 4 are
a = (t 4, sep|a). therefore, ep is the
given by e +
desired bundle over t 4  bt 4 that carries the family of connections dening the operator
d : e +  e .

a = (t 4, s+ep|a) and e 

thus, we nd that the t-duality transformation of the d-brane charge is given by
e 7 e  p 7 ind (d+, e  p), which can be considered as the image of (e, 0)  k(t 4)

by abuse of language, we shall denote ind (d+, e  p) by be. since the nahm transform

squares to the identity transform of instantons, the above map, which is the topological
reduction of the nahm transform, must also square to the identity of k(t 4). namely, the
inverse of (4.3) is given by

to compute the index, we use the formula

(4.5)

ch(ind (d+,v)) =zx

ch(v)ba(x)

which holds for the dirac operator d+ : (s+)  (s) on any even-dimensional spin
manifold x coupled to any family of connections carried by a bundle v over x  y where
y is a compact parameter space. here, ba(x) is the a-roof genus of x which belongs to

h (x, q) and ch is the chern character, which is a group homomorphism

ch : k(x)  h even(x, q)

(4.6)

dened for a general topological space x. note that ch0 = rank, ch1 = c1, and ch2 =
c2
1/2  c2 etc.

in the present case, we have (see the next section)

k(t 4) = z8

(4.7)
and the chern character maps this isomorphically to the subgroup h even(t 4, z) = z8
of h even(t 4, q) = q8 where h 0(t 4, z) = z, h 2(t 4, z) = z6 (generated by ij),
h 4(t 4, z) = z (generated by the volume form).
in particular, no information is lost
by looking only at the chern character. since we have v = e  p and ba(t 4) = 1
the character of the index is ch(be) = rt 4 ch(e)ch(p). since p is a line bundle we have
ch(p) = ec1(p). then, (4.2) shows that the chern numbers of e are related to that of the
index be as

4.2 orthogonal/symplectic (orienti)bundles and z2 orbibundles

we next nd the map of d-brane charges under the t-duality on t 4 in the presence
of orientifold/orbifold projection, by considering the topological reduction of the nahm
transforms constructed in section 3.

structures of the poincare bundle

the bundle p and the connection  has two basic properties which are useful for the
present discussion (and which we have actually implicitly used in the construction of the
nahm transform). one is the structure of an orthogonal orientibundle. we note that the
anti-linear involution

i : (x, a, c) 7 (x,a, c)

(4.11)
of the trivial bundle over t 4  (r4) commutes with the action (4.1) of 2, and hence
denes and orthogonal structure on p over (x, a) 7 (x,a). we also note that the
connection  coming from the gauge potential iadx is invariant under this z2 action.
thus, (p, , i) becomes an orthogonal orientibundle with a connection over t 4  bt 4 with
respect to the inversion of the bt 4 factor. the other is the structure of an orbibundle. the

involution

 : (x, a, c) 7 (x,a, c)

(4.12)

obviously commutes with the 2 action and preserves the connection . thus, (p, , )
is an orbibundle with a connection over t 4  bt 4 with respect to the total inversion.

relevant k-theory groups

as we have seen in section 3.3, in theories with orientifold/orbifold projection the
chan-paton bundles on d9-branes have various extra structures. accordingly, the relevant
k-theory groups vary.

the k-theory group for orthogonal bundles over a space x is the ko-theory group
of x denoted by ko(x). that for symplectic bundles is likewise denoted by ksp(x).
now let y be a space with an involution . then, the k-theory group for orthogonal
orientibundles over y with respect to  is what is known as kr-theory group and is
denoted as kr(y ). we can also dene k-theory group for symplectic orientibundles
over y with respect to . we shall denote it by kpr(y ). finally, the k-theory for z2
orbibundles over y with respect to  is given by the z2-equivariant k-theory and the
group is denoted by kz2(y ).

37

note that orthogonal (orienti)bundles and z2-orbibundles are closed under tensor
product. therefore ko(x), kr(y ) and kz2(y ) become rings. however, symplectic (ori-
enti)bundles are not closed and thus ksp(x) and kpr(y ) has no ring structure. instead,
the tensor product of two symplectic (orienti)bundles is an orthogonal (orienti)bundle,
and the tensor product of an orthogonal and a symplectic (orienti)bundles is a symplectic
(orienti)bundle. thus, the sums ko(x)  ksp(x) and kr(y )  kpr(y ) become rings.
(i) ko(t 4) = kpr(bt 4)

we rst consider the so-type orientifold and nd the transformation of d-brane
charges under t-duality on four-torus. as we have seen in section 3, d9-branes in type

i string theory support orthogonal bundles while those in type iib orientifold on bt 4/z2
support symplectic orientibundles over bt 4 with respect to the inversion. thus, we must
nd a map from ko(t 4) to kpr(bt 4) and back. as in the previous subsection, we can

nd this by taking the topological reduction of the nahm transform between orthogonal
bundles and symplectic orientibundles obtained in section 3. we recall that the transform
is based on the nahm transform for the underlying unitary bundles. thus, we basically
follow the maps (4.3) and (4.4).

bundles s on t 4 (or on any four-dimensional spin manifold) has a symplectic structure
coming from the charge conjugation. thus, tensoring an orthogonal orientibundle with

since the poincare bundle p has an orthogonal structure over the inversion of bt 4, the
tensor product of an orthogonal bundle over t 4 (pulled back to t 4  bt 4) and p denes
an orthogonal orientibundle over t 4  bt 4 with respect to the inversion of the bt 4 factor.
thus, p denes a map from ko(t 4) to kr(t 4  bt 4). on the other hand, the spinor
s (pulled back to t 4  bt 4) makes a symplectic orientibundle. then, the index of the
dirac operator on t 4 becomes a symplectic orientibundle over bt 4. thus, ind d+ denes
a map from kr(t 4  bt 4) to kpr(bt 4). by composition, we obtaine a map

ind d+

ko(t 4)

p

 kr(t 4  bt 4)

 kpr(bt 4).

(4.13)

in section 3, we have seen that the symplectic structure over the inversion of bt 4 obtained

this way is exactly the same as the one for the t-dualized system. thus, (4.13) is the
desired map for the t-duality transformation of the d-branes charges.

the inverse map can be obtained in a similar way. we only have to note that the dual

poincare bundle bp also has an orthogonal structure over the inversion of the bt 4 factor and
that the spinor bundles bs on bt 4 has a symplectic structure over the inversion coming

38

from the charge conjugation followed by the multiplication by 1234. the result is

ko(t 4)

indbd+
 kpr(t 4  bt 4)

bp
 kpr(bt 4).

(4.14)

the two maps (4.13) and (4.14) must be the inverse of each other, since the nahm
transforms are. in particular, these must be isomorphisms of groups. indeed these groups
are isomorphic (see the next section)

ko(t 4) = z  z4

2  z6

2  z = kpr(bt 4).

(4.15)

we next consider t-duality on four-torus of the sp-type orientifold. as before, we

(ii) ksp(t 4) = kr(bt 4)
obtain the map of d-brane charges, from ksp(t 4) to kr(bt 4) and back, by topological
reduction of the nahm transform of section 3. we use the orthogonal structure of p (bp)
over the inversion of the bt 4 factor and the symplectic structure of the spinor bundles s
(bs). the result is

ind d+

ksp(t 4)

and the inverse is

ksp(t 4)

the two groups are indeed isomorphic

(iii) kz2(t 4) = kz2(bt 4)
finally we obtain the map from kz2(t 4) to kz2(bt 4) by reducing the nahm transform.
what we use here is the fact that the poincare bundle p has a complex linear lift of the
inversion of t 4  bt 4 and that the spinor bundles s also have a linear lift of the inversion

given by the multiplication by 1234. then, the map is easily obtained. it is

kz2(t 4)

the inverse map is similar.

5 generalizations

in the nal section, we identify the isomorphism of appropriate k-theory groups that

realizes the map of d-brane charges under t-duality on torus of arbitrary dimensions.

5.1 relevant k-theory groups

as argued in [14] and as we have experienced, d-branes that can be represented as
bound states of dp-brane and anti-dp-branes wrapped on a (p + 1)-dimensional subman-
ifold w are classied by an appropriate k-theory group of w . in string thoery, it seems
common that any d-brane can be represented as a bound state of highest dimensional
d-branes (and anti-d-branes) lling the ten-dimensional space-time x. therefore, the en-
tire d-brane charges of a string theory on x can be classied by an appropriate k-theory
group of the full space-time x.

the relevant k-theory group for type iib string theory on x is k(x) while it is
ko(x) for type i string on x [14]. it was also proposed in [14] that d-brane charge in
type iia string theory takes values in k1(x)  the subgroup of k(s1x) consisting of
elements that are trivial on z0 x where z0 is a point in s1. this proposal was supported
by horava in [15]. he rst argued that any type iia (bps) d-brane can possibly be
represented as a certain bound state of the unstable non-supersymmetric d9-branes and
then identied the chan-paton bundle e with the tachyon eld t : e  e of d9-branes
as the pair (e, eit ) which determines an element of k1(x) via another version of the
denition of k1(x).

however, the precise k-theory group has not yet been identied for type ii orientifold.1
here, we consider z2 orientifold group generated by the product of an involution  of the
space-time x and the worldsheet orientation reversal. dp-branes on top of an op-plane
w 2 support orthogonal chan-paton bundle over w if w is of so-type while they support
symplectic bundle over w if w is of sp-type. away from orientifold planes, physics in the
quotient space x/z2 is locally the same as the underlying type ii string theory and in
particular d-branes locally support unitary bundles. thus, the relevant k-theory group
of x must satisfy the two conditions:

1however, it was suggested in [14] that it is kr-group in some unspecied set-up. a concrete proposal
appears in [30] but disagrees with what we will nd (and violates physical requirements (i) and (ii) below).
2as before, an orientifold p-plane w is a (p + 1)-dimensional submanifold of x consisting of xed
it is of

points of the involution  which acts near w as the sign ip of (9  p) normal coordinates.
so-type or sp-type depending on the sign of the surrounding rp2 diagram of fundamental string.

40

(i) the group corresponding to d-branes localized on an orientifold plane w must be
ko(w ) or ksp(w ) if w is of so-type or of sp-type respectively.
(ii) for a region r in x/z2 covered by two separate copies of r in x, the group corre-
sponding to d-branes in r must be k(r) for iib and k1(r) for iia orientifold.

we shall propose k-groups which satisfy these conditions. in order to present it, we

need to introduce some notions and facts in k-theory.

the groups krn(y ) and kprn(y )

let y be a space with an involution . let dp,q be the unit disc in rp+q on which
we let the involution act trivially on the rst p coordinates but by sign-ip on the last
q coordinates. we consider orthogonal orientibundles over dp,q  y with respect to
the involution acting on y by  and on dp,q as dictated above. we dene the group
krp,q(y ) = kr(dp,q  y, dp,q  y ) as the kr-group for bundles over dp,q  y
that vanish on dp,q  y . here bundle over a that vanishes on b  a stands for a
pair (e, f ) where e and f are bundles over a that are isomorphic on b, e|b = f|b.
replacing orthogonal by symplectic we obtain the group kprp,q(y ). we denote
krn(y ) = krn,0(y ) and kprn(y ) = kprn,0(y ). the following relations between
these groups are known as bott periodicity

krp,q = krp1,q1,
krn = krn8,
kprn = krn4.

(5.1)

(5.2)

(5.3)

using these, we dene krn etc for n > 0. we see that any of these groups is equal to
krn for some n. we also dene krn(y, z) for a z2-invariant subspace z  y as the
krn-group for bundles over y that vanish on z. 3

when the involution  acts trivially on y , we have kr(y ) = ko(y ) and kpr(y ) =
ksp(y ), and we dene kon(y ) := krn(y ) and kspn(y ) := kprn(y ). when y
is a disjoint union of two copies of a space r and the involution  is the exchange of the
copies, we have krn(y ) = kn(r) where kn is dened in a similar way and obeys
bott periodicity kn = kn2 so that kn = k for even n and kn = k1 for odd n.

3more precisely, krn(y, z) is the kr-group for bundles over sn  (y /z) that vanish on the base

point, where a  b is the smash product dened by (a  b)/((a  b0)  (a0  b)) (see [31]).

41

the proposal

we now propose the relevant k-theory group: d-brane charges of type ii orientifold

on x/z2 are classied by

kr(9p)(x) if there are op-planes of so-type only,
kpr(9p)(x) if there are op-planes of sp-type only.

(5.4)

(5.5)

let us show that this proposal satisfy the conditions (i) and (ii). we only consider
so-type orientifold and we put n = 9  p. the case of sp-type orientifold is similar and
is left to the reader. condition (ii) is easy to check by using the relation noted above,
krn(r r) = kn(r), and the fact that n is even (p odd) for iib and n is odd (p even)
for iia.

to test (i), let w be an orientifold p-plane. for the moment, we assume that the normal
bundle of w in x is trivial so that a neighborhood of w in x looks like a product space
d0,n w on which  acts on the sign-ip of the disc factor. from our proposal, the group
corresponding to d-branes localized on w can be identied as krn(d0,nw, d0,nw )
which is the krn-group for bundles over d0,n w that vanishes on d0,n w . namely,
the kr-group for bundles over dn,0  d0,n  w that vanishes on dn,0  d0,n  w and
dn,0  d0,n  w , i.e. on (dn,0  d0,n) w . since dn,0  d0,n = dn,n this is identied
with kr(dn,n  w, dn,n  w ) = krn,n(w ). by the bott periodicity (5.1), this is
equal to kr(w ) which is indeed ko(w ) since the involution acts trivially on w . even
when the normal bundle is non-trivial, this is true at least locally. glueing such local
realtions is a generalization of the proof of thom isomorphism theorem, and we expect
that this is also true globally.

the proposed group also has another desirable property that could have been added
to the conditions (i) and (ii). before showing it, we comment on a related fact about the
condition (i) itself. when d(p  4)-branes are wrapped on a submanifold w  of an op-
plane w of so-type, they support symplectic bundle over w . thus, d-branes localized
in w  must be classied by ksp(w ). since a neighborhood of w  in w locally looks like
d4w , the condition (i) shows that the relevant group is ko(d4w , d4w ) which
can be identied with ko4(w ). this is indeed ksp(w ) by bott periodicity (5.3). now
we go back to our proposal. if w  is a z2-invariant submanifold of x of dimension p + 5
including all the op-planes (of so-type), as we have seen in section 3, d(p + 4)-branes
wrapped on w  support symplectic orientibundle over w . thus, d-branes localized in
w  must be classied by kpr(w ). in fact, a neighborhood of w  in x looks locally like
d0,5pw  and the relevant k-group is identied as kr(9p)(d0,5pw , d0,5pw ).

42

as in the test of (i), this is equal to kr(9p),(5p)(w ) which is indeed kr4(w ) =
kpr(w ) by bott periodicity (5.1), (5.3).

we have shown that our proposal does satisfy all three requirements ((i), (ii) and
another) but we have not shown that it is the only possibility. in the next subsection,
we will show that it is the one that naturally appears when applying t-duality to type i
string theory (for so-type orientifold). 4

note that the proposal does not cover the most general cases. for example, there are
orientifolds including so-type and sp-type o-planes at the same time. there could also
be cases where there are o-planes of mixed dimensions. in this paper, we do not attempt
to specify the relevant k-theory group for such exotic (but sometimes interesting) models.

5.2 the t-duality isomorphism

now we identify the isomorphism of k-groups that realizes t-duality on n-torus.

we start with the basic example of n = 1. consider a d-brane conguration in type
iib string theory on t 1  m where m is a nine-dimensional manifold. we represent it
as a bound state of d9 and anti-d9-branes which support chan-paton bundles e with
connections a
m and the tachyon eld t : e+  e. we probe it with a d1-brane
wrapped on t 1. then, kaluza-klein reduction of the probe theory is identied with
the quantum mechanics of a d0-brane probing the t-dualized system on bt 1  m. we
coordinatize t 1 and bt 1 by x and a respectively. mass matrix of the fermions in the

quantum mechanics originating from 1-9 and 1-9 strings are given by the operator

x ia is the dirac operator d on t 1 coupled to the family of connections
here d = x +a
x  ia carried by e  p where p is the poincare bundle over t 1  bt 1 with curvature
a
idadx. this is interpreted as the tachyon eld of type iia ninebranes of the t-dualized
system.

for instance, consider (unphysical) type iib string theory on t 1r9 with a single d9-
brane with wilson line ia0dx where x is the coordinate on t 1 with periodicity x  x + 1.
then the dirac operator on t 1 for the fermion of the probe d1-brane is d(a) = x+ia0ia.
kaluza-klein modes on t 1 consist of functions einx, n  2z, with d(a) eigenvalues
i(a  (a0 + n)). one interpretation of these modes is as the 0-8 strings for a d0-
brane probing a d8-brane at the point a = a0 of the dual torus bt 1 (or equivalently

4chronologically, that is the way i found the proposal.

innite array of d8-branes at a = a0 + n in the covering space). alternatively, these
can also be interpreted as 0-9 strings for a d0-brane probing type iia d9-branes where
d(a) = i(a  (a0 + n)) are interpreted as the tachyon elds of d9-branes as appeared
in [15] which represent the innite array of d8-branes. one can also start with (physical)
type iib string theory with dp-brane (p is odd say 9  2m) wrapped on t 1 with wilson
line ia0dx. the dp-brane can be represented as a d9-anti-d9 bound state with tachyon
eld t = ix   where x = (x1, . . . , x2m) are the coordinates transverse to the dp-
brane and  = (1, . . . , 2m) are the gamma matrices mapping positive chirality spinors
to negative chirality spinors in 2m-dimensions. then, 1-9 and 1-9 fermions reduce to
fermions with mass matrix

d(x, a) = i(a  (a0 + n))

ix  

ix  

i(a  (a0 + n)) 

(5.7)

this can be expressed as d(~x) = i(~x  ~xn)  ~ where ~ are the gamma matrices for
the (2m + 1)-dimensions of ~x = (x, a) and ~xn = (0, a0 + n). this can be interpreted as
the tachyon elds of type iia d9-branes representing innite array of d(8  2m)-branes
located at x = 0, a = a0 + n. thus we have recovered the fact that a dp-brane wrapped
on a circle is t-dual to a d(p  1)-brane in the dual circle where the wilson line on the
dp-brane corresponds to the position of the d(p  1)-brane [1].

as in t 4 case, the interpretation of the operator d as the tachyon eld of ninebranes
in the t-dualized system would lead to an index-theoretic map of k-theory groups that
realizes transformation of d-brane charges under t-duality. note that the operator d
(as well as the dirac operator d on odd-dimensional space) is skew-adjoint and therefore
its family index always vanishes as an element of the k-group of the parameter space.
however, atiyah and singer in [7] 1 studied index theory of such families and found that
the index naturally takes values in k1-group of the parameter space. this is actually

what we wanted because t-duality maps type iib on t 1  m to type iia on bt 1  m
whose d-brane charges are classied by k1(bt 1m) where bt 1m appears in the present
set-up as the parameter space. the construction in [7] is as follows. if d(y) is the family
of skew-adjoint operators parametrized by y  y , we dene a family over [ 
2 ]  y by
(5.8)

2 , 

ed(t, y) =  sin t + d(y) cos t.

this is no longer skew-adjoint and therefore can have distinct kernel and cokernel. since
2 and therefore

2 ]  y ) = k 1(y ).

2 , y) = ed( 

ed( 
the index of ed belongs to k([ 

44

1we thank i.m. singer for explanation of essential points which are relevant in the present discussion.

the element of k1(bt 1m) obtained in this way in our set-up can be identied as the
d-brane charge of the t-dualized system. we show this in the example of d(92m)-brane
considered above where we put a0 = 0 for simplicity and we compactify the transverse
space r2m to s2m. the operator ed(t, ~x) =  sin t+d(~x) cos t has zero for constant modes
point, ed(t, ~x) on the constant modes behaves as

at (t, ~x) = (0,~0), and there are no zero modes everywhere else. in a neightborhood of this

(5.9)

ed(t, ~x) =  sin t  i~x  ~ cos t  (t + i~x  ~).

this has winding number one on the (2m + 1)-sphere surrounding (t, ~x) = (0,~0), and

therefore the index of ed has ch0 =    = ch2m = 0, ch2m+2 = 1 as an element of
k(s1  bt 1  s2m). this is the generator of k1(bt 1  s2m) = z which represents the
charge of the d(8  2m)-brane of the t-dualized system. 2

in the framework where the space-time is compactied, the change of the o-diagonal
part of (5.6) is a small perturbation and does not aect the index. therefore, the index
depends only on the k-theory class of (e+  p, e  p) where e  p gives a negative
contribution because the dirac operator d enters in d with negative sign. in partic-
ular, it can be denoted as ind (d, (e+  p, e  p)). thus, the map that realizes the
transformation of d-brane charges under t-duality can be identied as

k(t 1  m)

p

 k(t 1  bt 1  m)

ind d

 k1(bt 1  m).

in [7] orientibundles were also considered and it was shown that the index of a family
of skew-adjoint operators on a real hilbert space takes values in kr1 of the parameter
space via the same construction. thus, we also have

(5.10)

(5.11)

kr(t 1  m)

p

 kr(t 1  bt 1  m)

 kr1(bt 1  m),

ind d

where the involution acts trivially on t 1 but as the inversion on bt 1.
what if we started from an element of k1(t 1  m)? such an element can be con-
sidered as an element of k(s1  t 1  m) that vanishes on z0  t 1  m. tensoring with
p and taking the index do not aect the triviality at z0  s1. thus, its image under the
2in [15], the element of k1(x) corresponding to the (anti-hermiaitin) tachyon eld t : e  e of
iia ninebrane is identied as (e, et ) in the denition of k1(x) in [32]. it is (eet , eid) in the standard
denition of k1(x) as the subgroup of k(s 1  x), where e for an auatomorphism  : e  e is a
bundle over s 1  x dened as [0, 1]  e modulo the identication (0, v)  (1, v). in our set-up, after
a suitable regularization of t = d, et has winding number one on a disc d2m+1 containing ~x = ~0 (i.e.
it is constant on d2m+1 and the induced map on s 2m+1 = d2m+1/d2m+1 has winding number one).
therefore eet and eid dier in ch2m+2 by one, determining the same element as the index of ed.

45

map (5.10), which a priori belongs to k1(s1 bt 1 m), actually belongs to the subgroup
k2(bt 1  m). such a consideration leads to the following generalizations of (5.10) and

ki(t n  m)  kin(bt n  m),
kri(t n  m)  krin(bt n  m),

assumed to have a suitable involution so that i can be chosen appropriately.

representing t-duality on n-torus where now m is a (10  n)-dimensional manifold. in
the latter case, the involution acts trivially on t n and as the inversion on bt n while m is
as a consistency check, let us consider type i string on t n  m which t-dualizes to
type ii orientifold on bt n/z2  m of so-type. type i d-brane charge takes values in
ko(t n  m) = kr(t n  m). therefore, by (5.15), we see that d-brane charges of type
ii orientifold on bt n/z2  m must be classied by krn(bt n  m), thus reproducing our
proposal (for so-type orientifold). also, when involution acts on m with only rs/z2-
type xed points, according to our proposal, d-brane charges of orientifold on t n m/z2
are classied by kri(t n  m) with i = s or s + 4 for so- or sp-type respectively. then
(5.15) shows that d-branes in orientifold on (bt n  m)/z2 is classied by krj(bt n  m)

with j = s + n or s + n + 4, which is consistent with our proposal since there are only
rn+s/z2 xed points.

since t-duality squares to the identity, the maps we have obtained must be isomor-
phisms. here we do not attempt to compute these isomorphisms. instead, we show that
the groups are indeed isomorphic.

k-theory groups of t n  m

a subspace b of a topological space a is said to be retract of a if there is a continuous
map f : a  b that restricts on b to the identity. in such a case, there is a relation
k(a) = k(a, b)  k(b) which holds also for ki and krp,q. now let us apply this
to z0  m  t 1  m which is obviously a retract. noting that k i(t 1  m, z0  m) =
k i1(m), we have

ki(t 1  m) = ki1(m)  ki(m).

(5.21)

(5.22)

(5.23)

to consider the case with invoultion, as before we let z2 act on t n trivially and on bt n
as the inversion. then, z0  m  t 1  m and z0  m  bt 1  m are both retracts
where z0 is a z2 xed point. noting that krp,q(t 1  m, z0  m) = krp1,q(m) and
krp,q(bt 1  m, z0  m) = krp,q1(m), we have

krp,q(t 1  m) = krp1,q(m)  krp,q(m),
krp,q(bt 1  m) = krp,q1(m)  krp,q(m).

using these relations repeatedly, we obtain the binomial identities

where m is any space (with an involution in the latter two). using bott periodicity
kj2 = kj, krp1,q1 = krp,q, we see from these that

thus, the groups in the left hand side and the right hand side of the t-duality maps
(5.14) and (5.15) are indeed isomorphic.

applying the binomial identities (5.19)-(5.21) to the case where m is a point, let us
compute some k-groups of torus. we rst note that k(pt) = z and k1(pt) = 0. then ,
we immediately obtain from (5.19)

k(t n) = z2n1

, k1(t n) = z2n1

.

(5.24)

these are mapped isomorphically by the chern character maps ch : k(x)  h even(x, q),
k1(x)  h odd(x, q) to the even and odd dimensional integral cohomology groups of
the torus respectively (or more precisely their images in the rational cohomology). note
that 2n1 is the dimension of the (positive or negative) spinor representation of so(2n).
in fact, it is known that the t-duality group o(n, n; z) acts on the rr potentials in the
spinor representation, where iia potentials belong to, say, positive spinor representation
while iib potentials belong to negative spinor representation which are interchanged under
odd number of t-duality on circles [33]. this fact may be explained by showing that our

47

t-duality maps for d-brane charges (together with the mapping class group of t n and
some operation corresponding b-eld shift) generate spinor representation of o(n, n; z).

to compute kri(t n), we need to know kri(pt) = koi(pt). non-zero groups of
them are ko(pt) = z, ko1(pt) = z2, ko2(pt) = z2 and ko4(pt) = z. inserting
these into the identities (5.20) and (5.21) we obtain for example

(5.25)

(5.26)

ko(t 4) = z  z4
2  z6
ksp(t 4) = z  z = kr(bt 4).

2  z = kpr(bt 4),

it is intereting to investigate what the full t-duality group is and in which representation
the d-brane charges (and rr elds) belong to.

appendix

a the inversion theorem

in this appendix we show that square nahm transform is the identity operation for
orthogonal/symplectic (orienti)bundles over t 4 (t 4/z2) or for unitary orbibundles over
orbifold t 4/z2. namely, we prove that there is an isomorphism

(e, a, )

= (e, a, )

(a.1)

where  is either one of

(i) the orthogonal structure dened by anti-linear maps ix : ex  ex
(ii) the symplectic structure dened by anti-linear maps jx : ex  ex
(iii) the z2-orbifold action dened by linear maps x : ex  ex
on the unitary bundle e over t 4, and    and    are the nahm transforms which we
have constructed in sections 3 ( is equal to  for the case (iii)). it is already known that
there is an isomorphism (e, a) = (e, a) [9, 11] (see also[12]) if we ignore the respective
structure . therefore, what we need to do is to show that this isomorphism sends the
structure  to that of the square nahm transform. we present the proof for the case (i)
in some detail, and only indicate the essential points for the cases (ii) and (iii).

we rst recall the denition of the isomorphism u : e  e [11]. let us denote by
ga the inverse of the laplace operator d(a)d(a) associated with the covariant derivative
 =  + a  ia. then for v  ex, u(v) (cid:16) e(cid:17)x
d(a)
is given as the section of the bundle
e  s dened by

u(v) : a 7 1[(a)

i

]  c((ga(a)

i

)(x), v)

(a.2)

i

where {(a)
i } is an orthonormal basis of the kernel of the dirac operator d/ (a) (representing
an orthonormal basis {[(a)
]} of ea), c is the charge conjugation matrix and ( , ) is the
hermitain metric of e which is anti-linear in the left-entry and linear in the right-entry.
(the phase 1 in front is simply for later convenience.) to be precise, (a.2) denes a
section of e  lx  s where lx is a at bundle dened as the quotient of (r4)  c
with the trivial connection by the 2 action (a, c) 7 (a + n, einxc). (this is because
(a)(x)  kerd/ (a) and (a+n)(x) = einx(a)(x)  kerd/ (a+n) are identied as an element of
ea.) however, lx is topologically trivial and is isomorphic as a at bundle to the trivial
bundle bt 4  c with the connection d = d  ixda. by this identication, we consider

49

u(v) as a section of e  s. one can show, as in [11], that u(v) is annihilated by the
dirac operator associated with the covariant derivative /a + a  ix, thus showing
that u(v) belongs to (cid:16) e(cid:17)x
. moreover, it was shown in [11] that u sends the hermitian

metric of e to that of eand the connection a to a.

now let us show that u sends the orthogonal structure i of (e, a) to that i of (e, a).

namely we show that

ixu(v) = u(ixv),

(a.3)

for each v  ex. by denition, we have iu(v)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)a
= 1ja([(a)
= 1[i c(a)
= 1[i c(a)
= 1[i c(a)

(a.4)

where i is considered as an operator acting on the section s(x) of e as (is)(x) := ixs(x).
note that iga = gai which follows from id(a) = d(a)i. then, we see that

c(iga(a))(x) = cgai(a)(x) = gai c(a)(x).

inserting this to (a.4), we have shown (a.3):

iu(v)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)a

= 1[i c(a)
= u(ixv)|a,

i

(a.5)

thus proving (a.1).

the proof for the cases of (ii) and (iii) are similar. the essential points in these cases
are jga = gaj for (ii) and ga = ga for (iii), where j and  are considered as
an operator acting on the section s of e as (js)(x) = jxs(x) and (s)(x) = xs(x)
respectively.
