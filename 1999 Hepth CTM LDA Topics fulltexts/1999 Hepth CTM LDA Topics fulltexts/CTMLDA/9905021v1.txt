on generations

alejandro rivero

february 28, 2008

abstract

the well known operator ordering ambiguity could motivate the exis-
tence of generations. this possibility is explored by exploiting the rela-
tionship between ordering and discretization rules.

proposals to get the structure of quantum elementary objects from the dis-
cretization of space or its regularization are signicant in the literature. but we
are not aware of any suggestion to extract from there the spectrum of elementary
fermions. we advanced that idea last year [5], jointly with other conjectures of
diverse quality (mostly slippery). as a piece of the puzzle, it was suggested that
the existence of three generations of elementary particles is the method nature
uses to parametrize the ambiguity of quantization. here some additional toy
models are proposed to explore this point.

this letter is mainly a progress report, say to keep friends informed, so it is

kept deliberately short, please refer to [4] for context.

it is possible also to try to start sooner, let say from a naive ladder dl(x) 
(x  l), to see it as an innite matrix mechanics, and then duplicate, collect

somewhere in kent, england. email: alejandro.rivero@gecm.com

and reorder vectors to connect with the above scheme. this naive ladder is
easier to link with other formulations, say kauman or costella, to name a pair
of interesting ones.

2 from quantization ambiguity to generations

consider x+ = f (t+)f (t)
quantization ordering rules. for generic ordering take1 x() =  x+ +  x.

and x = f (t)f (t)

. see [2] for their relation to





apply the previous method. you will need to duplicate the vector space,

and presumably to draw a more sophisticated representation af of functions.

for instance, let it be

f (t  ) + f (t)(cid:19) , f =

1

2 (cid:18) f (t + ) + f (t  )

2f (t)(cid:19)

f =

2 (cid:18) f (t + ) + f (t)
m4 m2(cid:19), and set d = (cid:18)

m = (cid:18) m1 m3

thus, putting m1 = m2 = 2/, m3 = m4 = 2/,

m

(cid:19), a = (cid:18) f

so that ambiguity xing at a combination ,  can be related via those toys to
a two generations structure with mass eigenvalues proportional to   . far
away from the order of magnitude of the real thing except if   , which, on
the other hand, is the usual symmetric guess,  =  to get weyl.

we conjecture that if our lagrangian had second order derivatives, we should
need three generations (alternatively, it could be considered to take dierent
ambiguity xing in each derivation). simultaneous tting of rst and second
derivatives is also interesting, because it suggests special mass relationships (for
instance,     1/).

the a matrix in the example shows an aspect more sensate in the basis
of mass eigenvectors, but we have preferred to keep it diagonal. out of the
toy model, more serious derivations must be done, for instance using [d, a] =
g[d, x] = [d, x] g with x coming from the obvious coordinate function f (x) =
x, and then linking the so dened derivatives g, g with the objects of barrow-
majid non-commutative calculus, and so on.

it is wanted a null limit for the odd combination

use  to regularize the lagrangian. our dierential elements are then replaced
by nite dierential slices.

a discrete dierential in a point is an ane covector instead of a free one,
which is the usual limit case. in 0 + 1 it is given by two points, that become two
parallel planes in physical space. the famous[3] wine dance argument from
feynman applies: rotation of one point is topologically equal to exchange.

our pseudo fermions in the previous section would absorb into themselves
this property, for the discrete summation to proceed without topological con-
siderations. ideally, the rule should be applied for each of the four dierentials2
in 3+1 space in order to get four fundamental particle elds. vectorial gauge
elds and anti-particles must be added following recipes in [1], in order to estab-
lish dualities between homology and cohomology, thus guaranteeing the usual
properties of integral calculus.

an additional clue should come from the uses of grassman variables (for in-
stance, in superspace formalism). reminder that such variables were suggested
in the xixth century as a way to formalize innitesimal calculus. a grass-
man variable could be presented as a very small interval such that its square
was orders of magnitude smaller, thus zero in approximative calculations. we
could expect that our fermions had some map into grassman variables when
the continuous limit is taken 3.

4 from there to the limit?

field theory is about nding the extremal of a functional f [f ]. to accomplish
it, we regularize the functional introducing two scales, two units a, a of position
and momentum respectively. then the limit is taken to remove the scale. if
aa  0, it is called classical eld theory. if aa  h, being h a nite constant, it
is called quantum eld theory.

point is, references to continuous and discrete worlds seem to forgot that
the former is built from the latter. the proof of existence of classical objects
involves a regularization jointly with a jump to the limit. it has been so since
archimedes age. but from wilson we know that such proofs are equivalent
to the existence of xed points in the space of regularizations, and that the
argument can be developed by referring anything to an scale h0. just as the
limit of a series an/bn  0/0 is got by referring all its elements to a nite
constant denominator.

the metaphysical justication of our toys would be to come someday to
claim that qft is the correct proof of existence of classical eld theory (well, it

2if you feel uncomfort identifying dierentials and particles, try instead to say low energy
modes of an 1-brane (sorry, the temptation was too strng, at least i have put it on a footnote.
but please remember why they were called p-things, the p-branes). to identify particle elds
with special choosing of coordinate elds seems too far-fetched, but it is appealing to think
of conned elds as angular coordinates, without length units. so we have mixed feeling
about it.

3this is touchy, as those variables in classical mechanics are only a trick to formalize
variational calculus (we simply look for solutions f [f + ] = f [f ]); their role could be dierent
here

should be closer to the proof of existence of a variational calculus). and that,
by some reason, nature does not like to make the jump into this limit.

postlude

i noticed some white space, so let me to ll it other suggestion.

even if you has not liked anyone of the previous, i am sure you will like this:

i was prevented about the script, but the author has made a deep research,
more careful than the usual newspaper comments about the meetings between
bohr and heisenberg. better, the main plot has a lot of deviations you will
enjoy, for instance when bohr remembers his doubts about the spin, or when
he asks for simplicity in the dialogue, because they must be able to explain
everything to margaritha
