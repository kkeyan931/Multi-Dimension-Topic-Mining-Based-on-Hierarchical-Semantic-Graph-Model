perturbative quantum gauge fields

on the noncommutative torus

abstract

using standard eld theoretical techniques, we survey pure yang-mills theory on
the noncommutative torus, including feynman rules and brs symmetry. although
in general free of any infrared singularity, the theory is ultraviolet divergent. because
of an invariant regularization scheme, this theory turns out to be renormalizable
and the detailed computation of the one loop counterterms is given, leading to an
asymptoticaly free theory. besides, it turns out that non planar diagrams are overall
convergent when  is irrational.

1 introduction

it is now well admitted that our current concepts of space and time have to be modied
when dealing with very short scale physics. one possible modication, inspired by quantum
mechanics, is to allow for noncommuting coordinates. since all relevant physical theories, like
yang-mills theory or general relativity, are of geometrical nature, it is necessary to develop
geometrical concepts incorporating noncommutative coordinates.

among all possible ways to develop non commutative geometry, the approach pioneered by
a. connes (see [1] and [2] as well as [3] and [4] for a pedagogical introduction) already proved to
be relevant in describing the standard model of particle physics (see [5] and references therein
for a review.)

another important breakthrough occured when these ideas appeared naturally in the study
of compactication of matrix theory (see [6] and [7]). in this survey, the central tool is yang-
mills theory on a noncommutative torus. roughly speaking, such an object is obtained after
insertion of phase factors between the fourier modes on the standard torus. from the math-
ematical point of view, this is a rather well known object [8] on which yang-mills theory has
been fully developped (see [9] and [10]), even with non trivial topological structure.

here, we will be concerned with the perturbative quantization of this theory. to this
aim, we will rst review in the simplest possible terms the noncommutative torus and the
corresponding yang-mills theory. we stick to the notions which are necessary in what follows
so that this paper requires no previous knowledge of noncommutative geometry. then we turn
to the perturbative quantization, derive feynman rules and study general aspects of the theory,
including renormalizability. this survey is carried out in the simplest possible case, i.e. pure
yang-mills theory without supersymmetry.
in particular, we do not include fermionic elds
and refer to [11] for a theory involving fermions. the next section is devoted to a detailed
computation of the one loop counterterms using  function regularization. finally, we come to
grips with higher order diagrams and show the niteness of non planar diagrams.

2 algebraic preliminaries

we begin this section by gathering the basic denitions of the theory as well as some useful
formulae. first of all, we introduce the algebra of coordinates a on the noncommutative torus
of dimension d as the involutive algebra generated by d unitary elements u1, . . . , ud fullling

uiuj = e2iij ujui,

(1)

where ij  md(r) is an antisymmetric matrix. when all its entries are integral, we get a
commutative algebra and we recover the usual n-dimensional torus if we identify the previous
generators with the standard exponential of the coordinates on the torus.

in complete analogy with the usual torus, a generic element f of the algebra a is power

expanded as

f = x(p1,...,pd)zd

fp1,...,pd(u1)p1    (ud)pd.

(2)

since we want to deal with the analogue of smooth functions, it is necessary to assume that the

1

sequence of complex numbers fp1,...,pd decreases faster that any polynomial when |p1| +    +
|pd|  +.

for later purposes, it is convenient to denote by u p the product (u1)p1    (ud)pd for p =
(p1, . . . , pd)  zd. the latter satisfy the product rule u pu q = e2i(p,q)u p+q, where (p, q) =
pq,  being a matrix obtained from  after deleting all its elements below the diagonal. in
the previous relation, we have used einsteins convention of summation over repeated indices,
as will always be the case for greek indices. moreover, when the indices lie at the same level,
a contraction with the basic euclidean metric is self-understood. to simplify the product rule,
we replace u p by ei(p,p)u p so that we have

u pu q = ei(p,q)u p+q.

(3)

in the mathematical language this denes a projective representation of the abelian group
g = zd. it can be extended to any other abelian group and it will prove to be useful to take
for g the group rn (noncommutative rd) or a product with the nite group zn (u(n) gauge
elds).

we introduce the dierential calculus on the noncommutative torus by means of the deriva-

tions  dened as

u p = ipu p.

(4)

they form the noncommutative counterparts of the derivations with respect to the standard
coordinates on the torus. by denition, they satisfy the leibniz rule (f g) = f g + f g
for any f, g  a. although they form a linear space, it is important to note that in general
the coecients of a linear combination of these derivations should be constant for the leibniz
rule to be satised; which is more restrictive that in the commutative case. these coecients
may be considered as vielbeins, which determine a constant metric on the torus.

in complete analogy with the commutative case, the integral of f = pp fpu p is dened as

z f = v f0,

(5)

where v is a positive number which represents the volume of the torus. although v has to be
chosen in accordance with the choice of the vielbein, we will choose v = 1 for simplicity. this
integral has the property of being a trace on the algebra a, which means that

z f g = z gf

(6)

for any f, g  a.

furthermore, because the integral just picks up the the 0-th component of f , it is clear that

the integral of a derivative vanishes, which allows us to integrate by part

z f g = z f g

(7)

for any f, g  a.

whenever   md(z), it is clear that the algebra a is commutative and may be identied
with the algebra of functions on the standard torus. in the general case, the center of a is the
linear span of the monomials u p such that (p)  2zd, where we noted ((p)) = p.

2

two cases are of particular interest. first of all, if we assume that (p) / 2zd for any
p  zd, then the center turns out to be trivial. in this case, which we call the non degenerate
case, many proofs of general results are much simpler.

when   md(q), the center is isomorphic to the algebra of smooth functions on an ordinary
torus of dimension d. to prove it, we rst introduce a matrix s  sld(z) such that  = sts
is a block diagonal matrix made of 2  2 antisymmetric matrices [12]. because s is invertible in
the ring md(z), the monomials v p = u s(p) also span a and satisfy the simpler product rule
v pv q = ei(p,q)v p+q. thanks to the block diagonal structure of , it is sucient to study the
two dimensional case.

accordingly, let us denote by u and v two unitary elements such that

uv = e2i m

n v u,

(8)

where m and n are relatively prime integers. they generate the algebra of the two-dimensional
non commutative torus in the rational case, whose center is the algebra generated by u n and
v n . we identify u n and v n with the fourier modes e2ix and e2iy on a standard torus. if
p and q are two unitary n  n matrices satisfying p n = qn = 1 and p q = e2i m
n qp , it
n q. unfortunately, the latter are not
is tantamount to identify u and v with e
well dened functions over the torus and form a bundle of matrices over it, whose transition
functions are constant. this bundle, as well as all its higher dimensional generalisations, appear
in the description of the zero action sector of twisted gauge theory on the torus [21].

thanks to the trace properties of the integration, it is obvious that the previous action functional
is gauge invariant.

in this section, we have been deliberately ignoring much of the awe inspiring theory which
is behind this construction. for the present purpose, all what has been written is sucient to
understand what follows, but we urge the reader to consult the references quoted in the intro-
duction, where yang-mills theory has been fully developped in the context of noncommutative
geometry.

3 yang-mills theory

before entering into the computational details of the quantization of the action given by (11), let
us rst clarify what we mean by such a procedure. in its more general acceptance, the expression
eld theory refers to a dynamical system with an innite number of degrees of freedom.
working on r  t n1
, the previous action functional denes such a system whose degrees of
freedom are parametrized by all the functions ap
(t). it also has additional symmetry properties
under space and time translations, which lead to conserved quantities formally analogue to the
usual ones.



moreover, this action exhibits gauge symmetry and leads to a standard hamiltonian theory
with the noncommutative gauss law as a constraint.the equal time poisson brackets are easily
obtained by simply trading the standard lie algebra indices for momenta on t n1
. all this
classical construction only relies on purely algebraic relations and is easily obtained from the
standard theory provided the latter is formulated without any reference to the point structure
of the underlining space.



working on a formal level, the quantization of the system is obtained by replacing the equal
time poisson brackets by commutators of operators suitably represented on a hilbert space, for
instance by multiplication and derivation with respect to ap
i acting on the space of all functions
of these quantities. then, transition to path integral is carried out using standard techniques.
the only technical diculty lies in the fact that it is no longer possible to implement the
integration over the gauge group as the innite product 
x

dg(x) of haar measures.

any element of the group g of unitary elements of a can be expanded as a fourier series

pp gpu p, where the complex numbers gp are subject to the constraints c(p) = 0 with

c(p) = xq

gqpgqei(p,q)  (p),

(14)

and the additional constraints c (p) = 0 arising from gg = 1. inserting all these constraints
in the naive integration form yields a (formal) measure

[dg] = 
p

dgp 
q

c(q) 
r

c (r)

(15)

which is formally invariant under left and right translations and which is identical to the usual
measure in the commutative case. apart from that, one considers functional integrals over all
elds as products of functional integrals over all functions ap
(t). this provides us with a gauge
xed generating functional (in the lorentz gauge)

z[j] = z [da][db][dcdc]esy m [a]+sgf [a,b]+sf p [a,c,c]+r j a,

(16)

4

where b and j  are antihermitian maps form r to a and c and c are ghosts whose nature
will be precised below.

from now on, we assume that time has been compactied and we incoporate the latter as

a noncommutative coordinate, which means that we are back to t d
 .

the eld b is a lagrange multiplier for the lorentz gauge constraint, so that

sgf [a, b] = gz ba.

(17)

c and c are faddeev-popov ghosts that are expanded as c = pp cpu p and c = pq c qu q

where cp and cq generate an innite dimensional grassmann algebra. the faddeev-popov
term is

and the whole action is invariant under the nilpotent brs transformation dened as

the previous generating functional can be computed perturbatively using feynman dia-
grams. to proceed, we expand all quantities in fourier modes and we separate quadratic and
interacting terms. the quadratic terms are absolutely identical to the ones appearing in non
abelian gauge theories, thus yielding the gauge propagator

although the propagators are the same as in standard non-abelian yang-mills theory, the

interactions take a dierent form. to the three gauge bosons interaction

+(gg  gg) sin (p, r) sin (s, q)

(gg  gg) sin (p, s) sin (q, r)) (p + q + r + s).

finally, the interaction of a gauge boson with ghosts

is associated with



2gr sin (p, q)(p + q + r).

all these interactions are non local since they involve non polynomial functions of the momenta.
they are easily obtained from the standard feynman rules after replacing the lie algebra
structure constants fabc by 2 sin (p, q), which appear in the commutation relation

[u p, u q] = 2i sin (p, q)u p+q.

(24)

all this construction is readily extended to u(n) gauge elds on the noncommutative torus by
means of two unitary n  n matrices p1 and p2 fulling p n
n p2p1.

with a  b = a1b2  b2a1. accordingly, the incorporation of the additional u(n) structure is
easily implemented by a shift of the phases by 1

n a  b.

it follows from the inequality | sin (p, q)|  1 that any diagram which is convergent by
powercounting in standard non abelian theory is also convergent here. however, a short glimpse
at the one loop correction to the gauge boson propagator (see next section) shows that it is
divergent, as well as all other one loop diagrams. accordingly, the theory is also plagued by
ultraviolet divergencies and requires regularization and renormalization, as it must be the case
for rational .

nevertheless, it appears that the theory is completely free of any infrared singularity. indeed,
on the torus these singularities arise from the zero mode, which does not appear in the action
(11), since it commutes with all other elds. this is true only in the n = 1 case and is it
not true, for instance, when  = 0 and n > 1. this dierence between u(n) gauge elds
with trivial topology  = 0, n > 1 and the corresponding twisted sector  6= 0, n = 1 is easily
explained by the fact that the infrared sector is modied by the non trivial topology of the
gauge elds.

the occurence of one loop divergence (in dimension four, to which we stick to from now on)
and the new nature of the action, which incorporates non local interactions, raises the question
of its renormalizability. even if the theory is well known for rational , i.e. for a dense subset
of parameters, it is not a priori clear that all its properties extend by continuity to the general
case.

renormalizability of the theory will follow immediately from the existence of an invariant
regularization scheme, since it will enable us to construct recursively the required counterterms.
in our situation, such a scheme is provided by the higher-covariant derivatives and pauli-villars
regularizations [13].

although the orginal method turns out to be inconsistent [14], it is clearly established that
it provides a bona de regularization of yang-mills theory with minor modications [15], [16]
and [17].

the cornerstone of this procedure lies in adding to the previous action a term like



1

4 z f4f,

(26)

where  =  + [a, ] is the covariant derivative and  a cut-o. this term is gauge invariant
and modies the powercounting of all diagrams beyond one loop so that they are overall con-
vergent. since the powercounting is the same on the noncommutative torus and in non abelian
yang-mills theory, this statement still holds in our case.

however, due to the new interactions we have introduced, the one loop diagrams remain
divergent. they are usually regularized by means of additional pauli-villars elds, which carry
over to the noncommutative case provided they are dened in momentum space, like we have
introduced faddeev-popov ghosts. therefore, if such a procedure is consistent in non-abelian
yang-mills theory, it will also regularize yang-mills theory on the noncommutative torus in an
invariant way, thus establishing renormalizability.

unfortunately, the last construction is not consistent even in ordinary gauge theory. one
has to modify the construction as already mentioned. among all these modications, the
simplest one which is readily formulated in noncommutative geometry is the one described in

7

[18]. all this construction, including the higher covariant derivative action and the additional
pauli-villars elds, can be formulated in momentum space. thus, the replacement of all lie
algebraic structure constants by sine functions allows us to write the analogous regularization
on the noncommutative torus, and all argument presented in [18] are still valid in this case.

because it it rather lengthy, we postpone the detailed account of the adaptation of this
method to noncommutative geometry to a more thorough survey of gauge elds on the non-
commutative torus. however, these arguments are strong clues in favour of the renormalizability
of the theory to all orders.

4 1-loop counterterms and -function

in this section we shall compute explicitely the 1-loop counterterms using a  function reg-
ularization. to this aim, we will replace, after introduction of the feynman parameters, all
denominators kn appearing in feynman integrals by ks for (s) large enough and then take
the residue at s = n. of course this schems breaks brs invariance, but as far as we are
concerned with divergent parts of one loop diagrams, this symmetry is preserved.

to proceed, let us introduce

(s) = xk

eik

(k2 + 2pk + m2)s ,

(27)

where the summation runs over all elements of zd but a nite subset.
it also depends on
additional parameters: two vectors p and  of rd, a real number m and an integer n. because
the zero mode does not propagate, we are obliged to exclude from the summation a nite subset
corresponding to vanishing internal momenta.

when (s) is large enough, this function is holomorphic and it is easily seen, using poisson
resummation formula, that it extends to a holomorphic function on the whole complex plane
when  / 2zd.

if   2izd, the poles and their residues can be determined [19] and we get a pole when

s = d/2  n, n  {0, 1, . . . , d/2  1}, whose residue is

d/2 (p2  m2)n

(d/2  n)(n + 1)

.

(28)

writing s = d/2  n + , it is easily seen that these poles are the same as the ones of the
corresponding integral in dimension d2. by derivation with respect to p, we obtain additional
identities involving more complicated tensorial structures.

this relation ensures that we will have the same numerical coecients as in standard di-
mensional regularization. accordingly, most of the calculation follows the standard one and
the only novelty resides in the use of trigonometric identities in place of lie algebraic ones.

accordingly, the determination of the divergent part of the two and three point functions
are straightfoward. we rst linearize the corresponding products of sines and then pick up a
pole whenever the phase factor vanishes. however, it is worth noticing that the phases vanish
when the external momenta satisfy additional relations (p = 0 for the two point functions,
p + q = 0, q + r = 0 and q + r = 0 for the three point functions). fortunately, these divergences

8

play no role since the correponding interactions vanish identically when the external momenta
full the previous relations.

in dimension four, the divergent parts of the gauge boson and ghost propagators are respec-

tively

note that, as usual, the correction to the gauge boson propagator is transverse.

the total contribution to the divergent part of the interaction of gauge bosons and ghost

can be written as

where we have used the relation p + q + r = 0. only the rst term gives a pole and all divergent
contributions that appear in the other term cancel. accordingly the divergent part of this
interaction is

g22



2g(p + q + r) sin (p, q)

(33)

the divergent contribution to the interaction of three gauge bosons is computed in a similar

way and is given (in the  = 1 gauge) by

2g(p + q + r) (g(p  q) + gnu(q  r) + g(r  p)) sin (p, q)

4g22



.

(34)

the four point function of gauge bosons may be derived in an analogous way, but we have to
face two novel diculties. because these have no counterparts in standard non-abelian theory,
we found it interesting to spend a few lines retracing the main aspects of the computation.

all one loop diagrams contributing to this functions involve products of four sines, but one
or two of them may be independent of the internal momenta k. evaluation of these diagrams
is completely similar to the previous ones. when all sines depend on the internal momenta,
their product can always be written as

sin (a, k + x) sin (b, k  y) sin (c, k) sin (d, k),

(35)

where a, b, c, d is a permutation of p.q.r.s and x = c, y = d or x = d, y = c.
degenerate case, this yields a pole term of the type

in the non

8 ((a + b) cos (a, b) cos (c, d)
+(a + c)) cos (a, c) cos (b, d)

+(a + d)) cos (a, d) cos (b, c)) .

the term involving  functions is the rst major deviation from the standard calculation in
non-abelian gauge theory. furthermore, these terms challenge renormalizabilty and but they
disappear after the sum of all diagrams have been taken into account.

after all contributions have been added, the term begining by 4g2 22g2

 gg has a trigono-

metric factor given by

48 cos ((p, q) + (r, s))
48 cos ((p, r) + (s, q))
48 cos ((p, s) + (q, r)) ,

(36)

which is far from the initial yang-mills interaction. however, elementary transformations using
p + q + r + s = 0 yield

(p, r)  (s, q) = (q + s, p)  (q, p + r) =  ((p, s) + (q, r))

(p, q)  (r, s) = (r + s, p)  (s, p + q) =  ((p, r) + (s, q))

(p, q) + (r, s) = (r + s, p) + (p + q, r) =  ((p, s)  (q, r))

,

(37)

so that the trigonometric factor can be rewritten as

 40

48 cos ((p, r)  (s, q)) + 40
48 cos ((p, s)  (q, r))  40

48 cos ((p, s) + (q, r))

.

(38)

additional terms come from products of one and two sines involving the internal momenta and
also from other tensorial structures, so that the divergence of the four point function can be
rewritten as (in the  = 1 gauge)

4g2(p + q + r + s) ((gg  gg) sin (p, q) sin (r, s)

+(gg  gg) sin (p, r) sin (s, q)

3 (cid:17) ,
+(gg  gg) sin (p, s) sin (q, r))(cid:16) 2g22

(39)

which has the same trigonometric structure as the initial interaction. in the previous calcu-
lation, we assumed that  was not degenerate. if this is not the case, the computations are
only slightly more complicated, because we have to replace the  functions by an innite sum
of such functions corresponding to all possible vanishing phases. however, the nal result still
holds.

accordingly, it turns out that the theory is one-loop renormalizable. using standard nota-

tions [20], the required counterterms in the ms scheme are given by

z3 = 1 +

functions are (extending our results to a general gauge)

finally, the renormalization of the interaction between gauge bosons and ghost reads

(41)

(42)

appart from a factor 324 (corresponding to the volume of the torus that we set equal to
1) and the replacement of the casimir c2(g) by 2, we retrieve the usual expression for the
counterterms. therefore, they satisfy the usual relation

z4
z1

that ensures one-loop renormalizability.

from the previous relations, one readily computes the  function which is given by

(g) = 

112

g2.

(43)

(44)

accordingly, the theory is asymptotically free whenever  does not vanish.

at rst sight, this is a rather surprising result, since in the rational case we are working
with standard su(n) gauge theory whose -function depends in a crucial way on n. however,
this is nothing but a simple question of normalization: although our kinetic term is correctly
normalised, the basis of the lie algebra of su(n) we have been using is not correctly normalized.

taking into account the correct normalization, we have to multiply g by a factor of qn/2 which

yields the standard beta function.

the results we have obtained are reminiscent of those appearing in the large n limit of
gauge theory. indeed, as far as the one-loop computations are involved, the divergent parts of
the diagrams are continuous in  so that one can pass to the limit of large n with a large twist

 = lim

n+


n

,

(45)

where  is the twist tensor [21], which is also assumed to go to innity.

within this section, it clearly appeared that one can work with this theory as if it was
a standard gauge theory. appart from minor complications in the computations, no new
phenomena have appeared. however, the alluded relation with the large n limit suggests that
something new may occur when dealing with non planar diagrams, as we will see in the next
section.

5 higher order behavior

when dealing with higher order diagrams the following two questions arise in a natural way:

 what is the phase factor pertaining to such a diagram?

11

 how does this phase factor govern the divergence of the corresponding integral?

the answer of the rst question follows quite immediately from a previous work which we

shall briey review [22].

to begin with, let us introduce multivalent planar vertices whose arrows are ordered up
to cyclic permutation. vertices are related by lines and each of them is given an arbitrary
orientation is equiped with a momentum vector k  rn. we further assume that momen-
tum conservation holds for all vertices and we associate to a vertex with incoming momenta
(k1, . . . , km) the phase factor

exp i

 x1i<jm

(ki, kj)
 ,

(46)

where ki has been replaced by ki if it is outgoing. let us point out that we do not require
these diagrams to be planar so that a crossing of to lines is allowed.

the resulting phase pertaining to an arbitrary connected diagram with external lines p1 . . . , pe

and internal lines k1, . . . , ki is

exp i

 x1i<je

(pi, pj)

 exp i

 x1i,ji

ij(ki, kj)
 ,

(47)

where ij = 1
as follows,

2(iij iji) is the antisymmetrized intersection matrix of the oriented graph dened

iij = +1
iij = 1
iij = 0

if j crosses i from left,
if j crosses i from right,
if j and i do not cross.

(48)

ij = 


the two phase factors appearing in (47) have rather dierent origins: the rst one only depends
on the external momenta of the graph and the second one is due to the non-planarity of the
diagram. let us also point out that the phase can be computed from a reduced diagram
obtained after contraction of an internal line connecting a couple of vertices and closed loops
that do not cross any other internal line.

the relation between the previous statements and the phase factor in yang-mills theory
is obtained by expressing the trigonometric function pertaining to the diagram as a sum of
exponentials. this is translated diagrammaticaly as follows: we rst express the four-valent
interactions as a sum of three products of three-valent graphs (the internal line joining the
two vertices does not contribute to the phase), and then we reduce all-three valent graphs
(associated with a sine) as sums of two planar interactions (associated with an exponential).

this procedure allows to determine the phase factor of a given diagram quite easily. fur-
thermore, it proves that for any non-planar diagram there is still a phase factor depending on
the internal momenta, contrary to a planar one which always yields a function independent of
the internal momenta.

this has also been studied in the context of large n reduced models in [23]. strictly
speaking, the method applies to a matrix model describing the rational case, but it can be
readily extended to the general case. it essentially relies on interprating (p, q) as the ux of
the constant 2-form  through the triangle determined by p and q. then, to a given planar
feynman diagram we associate the dual one and the total phase is nothing but the ux of 

12

through the resulting polygon. by cutting all non planar diagrams, we obtain a residual phase
depending on the internal momenta. note that this method also requires xing the incoming
momenta up to cyclic permutation.

let us now see how these phase factors may be relevant in smoothing the divergences of a
given feynman diagram. to proceed, we rst study a simpler model based on the following
algebra.

let us introduce n coordinates x satisfying the commutation relation

[x, x] = 2i ,

(49)

where  is an antisymmetric n  n matrix of real numbers. we further dene on this algebra
an involution by assuming that these coordinates are hermitian.

for any real vector k  rn, we dene u k = exp ikx that may be rescaled by a phase so

that they fulll

u ku k

= exp i(k, k)u k+k

.

(50)

the latter are unitary generators of an algebra similar to that of the noncommutative torus
and it is not dicult to see that one can built a yang-mills theory out of it which is completely
analogous to the previous one provided one allows the momenta to take all values instead of
only discrete ones and that one replaces the series by integrals over the internal momenta in
feynman diagramms.

by a unitary transformation in momemtum space, one can reduce the matrix  to a
canonical block diagonal form made out of antisymmetric 2  2 matrices. furthermore, because
there is no preferred role assigned to the integral momenta k  zn, there is no analogue of
the rational case and the theory never corresponds to standard yang-mills theory. to avoid
complications, we will assume that the matrix  is invertible.

however, it is interesting to note that this theory is still free of infrared divergences, even
if it is dened on the analogue of an innite volume space. this follows from the fact that any
internal line carrying momenta k is always connected to two vertices sin (k, p) and sin (k, q),
thus implying the niteness of

sin (k, p) sin (k, q)

k2

(51)

when k goes to zero. however, since we will decompose the sines into exponentials this cancela-
tion no longer holds and we must incoporate a small mass term for the gauge elds. when the
sum of all exponentials pertaining to a given feynman diagram are taken into account, their
infrared divergences cancel and we let the mass go to zero.

after application of feynmans parametric formula, the integral over loop momenta k =

(k1, . . . , kl) can always be reduced to the evaluation of integrals of the form

in (, p, q, m) = z ddlk

ei

(k2 + 2pk + m2)n ,

(52)

followed by an integration over the feynman parameters and eventually a derivation with
respect to p to take into account the derivative couplings. for the sake of simplicity, we do not
consider these topics here. we recall that the phase (k) has already been determined and p
and m are functions of the external momenta and of a small mass which is added to the gauge
eld.

13

in general, this integral is divergent whenever dl  2n, so that it generally requires the
introduction of a regulator. within schwingers regularization scheme, the latter is provided
by a positive function  such that lim  = 1, which enables us to make the replacement

1

(k2 + 2pk + m2)n 

1

(n) z 

0

d()n 1e(k2+2pk+m2),

(53)

where  is a cut-o. in order to ensure convergence of the integral, the function  is supposed
to vanish in zero. for convenience, we simply choose () = (/), where  is the step
function.

accordingly, the gaussian integration can be performed and we get

in (, p, q, m) =

b() = 2p + i(q),

(55)

where q is a linear combination of external momenta that does not involve the feynman param-
eters. the remainig integral over  is convergent in the region   + (infrared divergence
in momentum space).

besides, it turns out that even when the regulator is removed, the integral is convergent
indeed, the rst non trivial term in the
when   0 except when  and q both vanish.
characteristic polynomial of    (which is non-zero whenever  6= 0) is sucient to regularize
the integral. if this matrix happens to vanish, the convergence is provided by the factor eq2/
if q 6= 0. when  and q both vanish, we retrieve the standard powercounting analysis.

therefore, as soon as there is a non-trivial phase factor, the feynman integral converges.
this always happens for non-planar diagrams so that we are tempted to conclude that the
corresponding integrals are always convergent. unfortunately, this is not true because of the
following two facts.

first of all, in our analysis we do not take care of the subdivergences. actually the phase
factor only regularizes the overall divergence. indeed, it may happen that for special values
of the feynman parameters the integral is reduced to that of a subdivergent diagram with
vanishing phase, thus yielding a divergence. assuming that the subdivergences can be taken
into account by standard tools like the forest formula, we will not emphasize this point here.

moreover, there are additional divergences for some exceptional values of the incoming
momenta. this happens whenever there is no crossing between internal lines so that the phase
factor is only due to non-vanishing q. since q is the image under  of some linear combination
of the external momenta, it vanishes as soon as the momenta full this relation.

this kind of divergence requires a counterterm containing a delta function appart from
the standard phase factor and thus threatens renormalizability. however, it follows from the
existence of an invariant regularisation scheme that the theory is renormalizable, so that we
expect these divergences to cancel when all diagrams pertaining to a given green function are
taken into account, as we have already shown at one-loop.

14

all these results are readily extended to the case of the noncommutative torus by means of

the poisson resummation formula. for any function f on rd, the latter states that

xnzd

f (n) = xnzdzrd

ddkf (k)e2i(kn).

(56)

applying this idea to the function appearing in a feynamn diagram yields the same gaussian
integral as before but with q shifted by the integer n. the summation over n is always convergent
as well as the remaining integral over  provided the phase does not disappear.

in the non-degenerate case, this is similar the the previous situation because the equation
q = n has no non-trivial solution, thus implying that the external momenta must full some
xed relation (exceptional momenta). in the rational case, this happens for innetely many
congurations of the external momenta because of the periodicity of the exponential. this
way one recovers the usual divergences of feynman diagrams in the twisted su(n) gauge
theory. indeed, after splitting of our momenta into standard momenta and color indices, we
get divergent contributions for all congurations of the standard momenta.

obviously, most of the statements of this last section are of conjectural nature and it is
clear that they deserve a more complete study that we postpone to future work. in particular,
it would be interesting to nd identities ensuring the cancellation of divergences of non-planar
diagrams. we also hope that this could shed some new light on large n theories.

when writing down the nal notes of seminars given in marseille, strasbourg and leipzig,
two other independent preprints dealing with related issues appeared.
in the rst one [24],
similar results are obtained on noncommutative r4 where as the second one [25] is devoted to
the 2+1 dimensional case.
