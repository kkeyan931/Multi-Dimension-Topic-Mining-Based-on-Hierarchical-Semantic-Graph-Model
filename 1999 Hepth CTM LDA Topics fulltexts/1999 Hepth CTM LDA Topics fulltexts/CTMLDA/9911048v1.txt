introduction:

despite,the plausible success of general relativity at the macroscopical level,
and the many attempts and eorts deployed no one has succeeded to solve
the renormalizability and the divergence problems which suers quantum
general relativity. the reason is essentially that the symmetry of the the-
ory was not enough to absorb these unwanted anomalies. as an alterna-
tive solution,a new symmetry called supersymmetry was introduced and the
corresponding theory baptized supergravity was generated as a local gauge
theory. however,the dream was not achieved and the new theory was still
non renormalizable.

during the last few years a generalized version of general relativity based
on the generalization of the space-time metric and called nonsymmetric
gravitation theory (ngt) was proposed [[1]-[8]]. the most remarquable
feature of this new theory is that all its predictions are compatible with the
classical tests of general relativity. although this success which account for
the macroscopical phenomena, a quantum version of this theory is needed.
recently,a quantum nonsymmetric gravitation theory (qngt) based
on the canonical operator formalism was constructed [9]. it turns out that
qngt has a rich symmetry [[9]-[12]] which may absorb the uncontrollable
divergences appearing in the pertirbative higher corrections and thus,solve
the outstanding problem of the renormalizability of the gravitation theory
and have a quantum consistent theory capable to give acceptable predic-
tions for the microscopical phenomena and probably be a good candidate to
account for the unication program with the other interactions.

it is the purpose of this paper to study the equal time tensor like commu-
tation relations and construct the ngt pauli-jordan d function in section
2,we derive the tensor like commutation relations. in section 3,we construct
the pauli-jordan d-function. and in section 4,we extend the tensor like
commutation relations to the case of a general local operator. finally in
section 5,we draw our conclusions.

2 tensor like commutation relation:

the classical nonsymmetric gravity is invariant under general coordinate
transformations. but the quantum version of this theory (qngt) loses this

2

property because of gauge xing. quite remarkably, however it is found that
qngt has a remnant of general covariance purely at the operator level. the
gravitational auxiliary b eld b plays the role of the generator of general
coordinate transformations, just as the electomagnetic b eld does that of
the local gauge transformation.

in ref.[10], we have calculated various equal time commutation relations
is the energy-

and since both ekl and tkl commute with b where tkl
momentum tensor and e dened as:

e = b + . + (  )

(cid:16) and 



are the ngt ghost and anti-ghost respectively(cid:17) . the ngt quan-

tum eld equations implies [[9]-[10]] :

[r (x) , b (x)] = i(cid:0)bg44(cid:1)1(cid:16)0

r + 0

r(cid:17) 3(cid:16)x  x(cid:17)

(2.1)

where rkl (x) is the ngt ricci tensor and the bg44 = gg44 . calcu-

lating the equal-time commutation relations between various matter elds
and b, we arrive at the following rule:let t be a local quantity which is a
tensor (or a tensor density) under general coordinate transformation (at the
classical level) then we have the following equal-time commutation relation.

[t (x) , b (x)] = i (t)4

(cid:0)bg44(cid:1)1

3(cid:16)x  x(cid:17)

(2.2)

we call eq. (2.2) a tensor like commutation relation, because it is con-

sistent with tensorial rules.

since the ngt ane connection w 

 is not a tensor, it does not, of

course satisfy eq. (2.2). explicit calculation yields to

(2.3)
using eq. (2.3), we can show that eq. (2.2) is also consistent with taking
spatial covariant derivative. since eq. (2.2) s an equal time commutation
relation, it is impossible to take the time covariant derivative (d4). but,
if we require the validity of eq. (2.2) for d4t, we nd what expression
ht (x) ,

b (x)i must have:

(2.4)
(where the.means the time derivative). this formula is again tensor-

like in the sense that it is consistent with tensorial rules.

the main question is whether or not eqs.

(2.2) and (2.4) are always
valid. the answer is no. for example, although e is expressible in terms
of classical tensors owing to the quantum eld equations, it does not satisfy

.

(2.5)
note that this non-tensor like term is proportional to the second deriva-
tives of b. if b is replaced by  in eq. (2.4), the resultant expression is

precisely equal to he (x) ,

.

 (x)i.

in general, eq. (2.2) and (2.4) are broken by non-tensor like terms if t
contain higher order derivatives of primary elds. but non-tensor like terms
are proportional to higher order derivatives of b, and if b is replaced
b (x)i

by , the non-tensor like parts of [t (x) , b (x)] and ht (x) ,
became equal to [t (x) ,  (x)] and ht (x) ,
 (x)i respectively.

in order to prove the above proposition, however, we need a more general

formulation of the problem.

3 quantum nonsymmetric gravity d-function:
in the minkowski space-time, the pauli-jordan d function d (x  y) plays
a fundamental role in the four dimensional commutator of massless elds.
it can be dened by the following cauchy problem:

xd (x  y) = 0
d (x  y) |4= 0
xd (x  y) |4= 3 (x  y )
4

(3.1)

here the symbol |4 means to set x4 = y4. of course, we know the explicit
expression for d (x  y), but its important properties are:

4

i)it is real
ii)it is odd in x  y
iii)it is poincar`e-invariant
iv)it vanishes for x  y spacelike.
the pauli-jordan d function can be extended to the case of curved
space-time in the following way. since the dalembertion in a curved space-
time is g1bg , we dene the curved-space-time d function d (x, y) by

the following cauchy problem:

xd (x, y) = 0

xbg 

d (x  y) |4= 0
xd (x  y) |4= (cid:0)bg44(cid:1)1
4

3 (x  y )

(3.2)

(3.3)

since there is no translational invariance, d (x, y) is not a function of x  y
alone.

it is known how to construct the solution to the dierential equation

g1 (x) 

xbg 

xd (x, y) = g14 (x  y)

in a geodesically convex domain , there exist two fundamental solutions,
dr (x, y) and da (x, y) which vanish outside the future and past cone, re-
spectively. then, it can be show that :

d (x, y) = dr (x, y) + da (x, y)

(3.4)
since dr and da are real and since dr (x, y) = da (y, x), d (x, y) is real
and antisymmetric under x  y.
now, we consider the quantum nonsymmetric gravity extension of the
pauli-jordan d function. we dene it by the cauchy problem eqs. (3.2).
although the coecient functions are now operators, we assume that the
cauchy problem is uniquely solvable. now, we investigate various properties
of the qngt d function which is bilocal operator.

first, we discuss the equal time behavior of the derivatives of d (x, y).
x4 + y4

for this purpose, it is connivent to transform x4 and y4 into t =
and  = x4  y4. the equal time x4 = y4 become  = 0, while t is arbitrary.
hence, we can freely dierentiate eqs. (3.2) with respect to t. transforming
back, we obtain:

by using eqs.(3.2) and (3.5) we can calculate (4
for m  p  0. for example , we can deduce that:
yd (x  y) |4= (cid:0)bg44(cid:1)1
3 (x  y )
x)2 d (x  y) |4= a  4(cid:0)bg44(cid:1)1

d (x, y)

next, we prove that

with

where an arrow indicates that the dierentiation acts to the left. because
d (x, y) is an operator depending an x, the order between d (x, y) and
bg (y) can not be interchanged. we postulate the uniqueness of the solution
to the cauchy problem, then, denoting the l h s of eq. (3.7) by f (x, y), we
have only to show that:

xf (x, y) = 0

xbg (x) 

f (x, y) |4= 0
xf (x, y) |4= 0
4

(3.8)

the validity of eq. (3.8) is obvious from eq. (3.2). it is also straight-
forward to prove eq. (3.8) by using eqs. (3.2) , and (3.6). here, we should
remember that no operator ordaining problem exists where we calculate the
equal time values. the l. h. s. of eq. (3.8) can be expressed in terms of 4
x
xd (x, y) (= 0) , (4
yd (x  y) |4 (= 4a)
y)mp d (x  y) |4 for m  2, and then is seen to vanish.
and (4
thus, eq. (3.7) is established.
evidently, eq. (3.6) together with eqs. (3.2) and (3.6) constitutes cauchy
problem with respect to y. since its solution is d+ (y, x), the uniqueness
postulate implies that:

owing to eqs. (3.6) and (3.2) the non local current

zd (x, z)bg (x)d (z, y)  d (x, z)bg 

zd (z, y)

(3.10)

is conceived with respect to z. hence the spatial integral of its  = 0
component is independent of z4. setting z4 = x4 (or z4 = y4), we see that
this integral equals d (x, y). thus we obtain an integral representation for
d (x, y):
d (x, y) = r dz (cid:8)

zd (z, y)(cid:9)(3.11)
 (bg x) = 0 , the same reasoning as above yield the following integral

zd (x, z)bg4 (z) d (z, y)  d (x, z)bg4 (z) 

now, since the supercoordinate x satises the dalembert equation,[12]

representations for x:

x (y) = r dz (cid:8)
zd (z, y)(cid:9)
x (x) = r dz (cid:8)
zx (z)(cid:9)(3.12)
finally, we show that d (x, y) is scalar under the choral symmetry trans-

zx (z) .bg4 (z) d (z, y)  x (z)bg4 (z) 
zd (x, z) .bg4 (z) x (z)  d (x, z)bg4 (z) 

formations, that is, we have:

[ip (x) ,d (x, y)] = (cid:16)x,bx(cid:17) (
[im (x, y ) ,d (x, y)] = (cid:16)x,bx(cid:17){x (x) 

x + 

y) d (x, y)

(3.13)
in fact, let f (x, y) be the dierence between both sides of eq. (3.13),
then the uniqueness of the solution of the cauchy problem implies the va-
lidity of eq. (3.13) if we can show eq. (3.8) .owing to eq. (3.2), we have

xd (x, y) + 

yd (x, y) .x (y)  (x  y )}

substituting:

[im (x, y ) ,bg ] = {(cid:16)y,bx(cid:17)  (bg x)   (y,bx )bgx   (y,bx)bg x

 (y,bx)bg x}  (x  y )

(3.15)

into eq. (3.14) and using eq. (3.2) in the form:



xx (x) 

xbg (x) 

xd (x, y) = 0

(3.16)

we obtain eq. (3.4).it is strightforward to prove eq.(3.4) by using eq.(3.2)
and (3.6), we obtain:

xf (x, y) |4= [im (x, y ) (cid:0)bg44(cid:1)1

(3.17)
from eq. (3.15), we nd that both terms of eq. (3.17) cancel exactly, this
proves eq. (3.15). thus eqs. (3.13) are established. in particular, d (x, y)
is ane scalar.

4 equal-time geometric commutation relation:

we extend the tensor like commutation relations to the case of a general
local operator  (x), which can be constructed from the primary elds
other than b,  and  by making the following operations nite times:

i)to take a linear combination.
ii)to take a product and to take the inverse for such an invertible quan-

tity.

iii)to apply any of dierentiations  (cid:0) = 1, 4(cid:1) .

the key to this extension is to make use of the quantum nonsymmetric
gravity d function. since  (x) has its classical counterpart, its change under
an innitesimal general coordinate transformation is well dened. let:



 (x)   (x)   (x)   ()  (x )

(4.1)

( is the transformation parameter). here () is a dierential operator
having the form:

 ()x =

rpj =0

l1 ....j

 (x , ) 1 ...j

(4.2)

where l1....j
 (x, ) is a local operator determined by  (x) and the
integer r1 does not exceed the highest order p of derivatives of the primary
elds involved in  (x). of course, we show

8

l (x, ) =  (x)
 (x, ) = [ (x)]
l



(4.3)

from the denition (4.1), it is obvious that  is a derivation as an

operator acting on . furthermore, we have

 (  (x )) =   ( (x ))

(4.4)

where, of course,  in the r. h. s acts not only on  ( (x )) but also on
its operand. notice also, that for a tensor ,  is the lie derivative.

as extensions of the tensor like commutation relations. (2.2) and (2.4),

we can prove by mathematical induction with respect to  that :

[ (x) , x (z)] |4= i(cid:16)x,bx(cid:17)  () d (x , z ) |4 +
[ (x) , 4x (z)] |4= i(cid:16)x,bx(cid:17)  () 4

ppj =2
p+1pj =2
zd (x , z ) |4 +

(4.5)
here f 1 ....j . (z, x, ) and . g1 ....j . (z, x, ) are some operators independent
of x, which are dened only at z4 = x4 and have the form:

1 ...j x (z ) f 1 ....j . (z , x , )

1 ...j x (z ) g 1 ....j . (z , x , )

(z) is a local operator

where n is an unspecied integer and 
symmetric in 1...j and in k1...ks.
it is easy to conrm that eqs.

(4.5) reduce to eqs.

(2.2) and (2.4)
respectively, apart from the non-tensor like term , where  = t and x =
b. we call eqs.
(4.5) the equal-time geometric commutation relations,
because  () represents the geometric nature of the classical ngt. of
course, such a geometric property cannot be completely valid in qngt
because the space time structure itself has quantum uctuations. this-
breaking is represented by the second terms, which we call non-geometric

terms (ng). the source of their appearance is [ (x) ,bg (z)] |4, that is,

the operator nature of the space time metric is the origin of non geometric
terms.

now, we extend the equal-time geometric commutation relations eqs.
(4.5) , to the four-dimensional form with the help to the integral represen-
tations (presented in section 3). our aim is to prove the following four-
dimensional geometric commutation relations:

9

[ (x) , x (y)] = i(cid:16)x,bx(cid:17)  ()x d (x , y)+z dz  x (z ) k (z , x , y, )

(4.7)
where k (z, x, y, ) is dened only at z4 = x4 is an unknown non local
operator independent of x. since the rst term vanishes for x 6= b, we
see that b (y)indeed plays the role of the generator of general coordinate
transformations and that the structure of the non-geometric term is common

prove eq. (4.7). owing to eq. (3.12) with z4 = x4 we have

for b,  and  (it vanishes for x (z) = bz, as it should be). now, we
[ (x) , x (y)] = r dz{[ (x) ,  x (z)]bg4 (z) d (z, y)  [ (x) , x (z)] .

zd (z, y)} |z4=x4 +r dz{ x (z) [ (x) ,bg4 (z)d (z, y)]

zd (z, y)]} |z4=x4

.bg4 (z) 
x (z) [ (x) ,bg4 (z) 

the rst integral can be calculated by substituting eqs. (4.5).to get:

(4.8)

i(cid:16)x,bx(cid:17)z dz{ ()x 

zd (x , z )bg 4  (z ) d (z , y) ()x d (x , z )bg 4  (z ) 

zd (z , y)} |z 4 =x 4

(4.9)
apart from the contribution from the non-geometric terms. since z4 is
arbitrary in the integral representation, (3.11) we can freely dierentiate it
with respect to x. hence, eq. (4.9) exactly produces the rst term of the r.
h. s of eq. (4.7). the remainder of the rst integral of eq. (4.8) can easily
be rewritten in the form of the second term of eq. (4.7), reduction to the
second order derivatives of x is achieved by means of the eld equation:

(4)2 x = (cid:0)bg44(cid:1)1

bgklklx  2(cid:0)bg44(cid:1)1

bg4kkkx

and integration by parts. now, straightforward manipulations based on the

notice that we have obtained a four dimensional commutation relations

fact that eq. (4.8) holds for x (y) = 1 and for x (y) = by.
in qngt, though we have almost no information about k .
[ (x) ,bg (x)], we can see in what order of time derivative of a primary

regarding, the non geometric terms and by examining the commutator

eld  a non geometric term arise for the rst term. suppose that :

(cid:2) (x) ,bg (cid:0)x(cid:1)(cid:3) = 0

10

then the condition [9]:

implies that:

bg = 0

(cid:2)4 (x) ,bg4 (x)(cid:3) = (cid:2) (x) , 4bg4 (x)(cid:3)
xh (x) ,bgk (x)i

= k
= 0

(4.10)

thus, the rst appearing non geometric term is always proportional to

klx but non to k4x.

let r be the least integer such (cid:2)(4)r  (x) , 4bg4 (x)(cid:3) 6= 0. then one

can show easily that a non geometric term (n.g) in [(4)n  (x) , x (x)] arise
rst at n = r + 2, that is

n.g. [(4)n  (x) , x (x)] = 0

n.g.h(4)r+2  (x) , x (x)i =

for n  r + 1

h(4)r  (x) ,bgkl (x)i(cid:16)(cid:0)bg44(cid:1)1

klx(cid:17) (x)

(4.11)
stands for the non geometric. for example, since r = 1 for

where n. g.
g , we have

n.g.(cid:2)(4)m g (x) , x(cid:0)x(cid:1)(cid:3) = 0, for n  2

(4.12)

from eq. (4.12), we can immediately infer that the riemann tensor r

satises the tensor like commutation relations (2.1). from eqs. (4.11) and

[x (x) , y (y)] = in(cid:16)y,bx(cid:17) x (x) + (cid:16)x, x(cid:17) y (y)o +  (x, y, x, y )

where k (z, x, y, ) is the quantity appearing in the four-dimensional ge-
ometric commutation relations (4.7). the symbol = means that eq. (4.15)
holds not in the sense of the formal equal time expression genuine four-
dimensional formula but in the sense of the formal equal-time expression,

5 conclusions:

throughout this work, we have derived all the equal-time geometric or ten-
sorial commutation relations and constructed the qngt pauli-jordan d-
function which it transforms as a scalar under choral symmetry (more details
are under investigation)[13].

acknowledgment:

we are very grateful to prof. a. vilenkin for fruitful private

communications.
