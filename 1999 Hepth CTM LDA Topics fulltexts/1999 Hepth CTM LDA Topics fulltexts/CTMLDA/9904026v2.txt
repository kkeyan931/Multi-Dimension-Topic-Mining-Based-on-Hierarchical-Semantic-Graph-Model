abstract

we demonstrate that qcd gluon amplitudes can be used to construct a lagrangian for
gravity. this procedure makes use of perturbative squaring relations between gravity and gauge
theory that follow from string theory. we explicitly carry out the construction for up to ve-point
interactions and discuss a set of eld variables in the einstein-hilbert lagrangian for interpreting
the lagrangian obtained from qcd. a spin-o from our analysis is that it can be used to provide
simpler tree-level gravity feynman rules than for conventional gauges.

introduction

although both gravity and gauge theories contain a local symmetry, they have rather disparate
physical properties. qcd, for example, is a conning theory while gravity is not. similarly, in four
dimensions qcd is renormalizable while eld theories of gravity are non-renormalizable. nonethe-
less, within the context of the perturbative expansions some remarkable squaring relations exist
between the tree-level s-matrix elements of gravity and gauge theories in both string and eld theo-
ries [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. these squaring relations imply that gauge symmetry is more closely related to the
dieomorphism invariance of gravity than one might suspect based on the respective lagrangians.
recently, there has also been a resurgence of interest in perturbative gravity both in anti-de sitter
spaces [6] and in phenomenological applications of large compact dimensions [7], further motivating
an investigation of these relations.

in this letter we will show that one can construct a low energy lagrangian for gravity directly
from qcd s-matrix elements and then discuss how this lagrangian relates to the usual einstein-
hilbert lagrangian. the starting point of our investigation is the kawai, lewellen and tye (klt)
relations expressing closed string tree amplitudes in terms of open string amplitudes [1]. these
relations arise from the property that the integrand of a closed string amplitude is composed of
left- and right-mover open string components (see e.g. ref. [8]). in the low energy limit where string
theory reduces to eld theory, the klt relations express gravity tree amplitudes in terms of a sum
of products of left gauge theory amplitudes and right gauge theory amplitudes.

the klt relations were rst exploited by berends, giele and kuijf to obtain an innite sequence
of maximally helicity violating pure gravity tree amplitudes [2] using known gauge theory results.
by unitarity, tree-level relations necessarily imply that loop amplitudes in the two theories are also
related.
indeed, the method of constructing s-matrix elements via their analytic properties (see
refs. [9]) provides a means for exploiting this to obtain loop-level (super) gravity amplitudes. using
these ideas, the divergence structure of n = 8 supergravity has been investigated with the result
that it appears to be less divergent than previously thought [3]. two innite sequences of maximally
helicity violating one-loop amplitudes in gravity theories have also been constructed [5]. these may
be viewed as results in an eective eld theory of gravity which necessarily must match the low energy
limit of a more fundamental theory, such as string or m theory. the ability to use the squaring
relation between gravity and gauge theory to perform non-trivial gravity computations suggests that
one can develop a deeper understanding of perturbative gravity by exploring this relationship.

from the point of view of the eld theory lagrangians, the klt relations are rather mysterious:
the einstein-hilbert lagrangian does not factorize in any obvious way in terms of the yang-mills
lagrangian. it is not even completely clear what the notion of left and right parts of the theory
mean given that the graviton is a symmetric tensor. another obvious diculty is that the yang-mills
lagrangian has only three- and four-point interactions while the einstein-hilbert lagrangian has an
innite set of interactions.

nevertheless, the gravity s-matrix does have the property that it is composed of products of two
gauge theory amplitudes and that a graviton, very roughly speaking, is composed of left and right
gauge elds, i.e., h  aa. when one has a property of the s-matrix, a natural idea is to organize

1

the underlying formalism so that it reects that property. as a well known example, the general
superiority of feynman diagrams as compared to time ordered perturbation theory follows from
their preservation of manifest lorentz symmetry. here we wish to rearrange the gravity lagrangian
so it captures properties associated with the factorization of the s-matrix into sums of products of
gauge theory amplitudes.

the analysis of this letter will consist of two parts.

in the rst part we will systematically
construct a gravity lagrangian from qcd gluon amplitudes using the klt relations. we explicitly
carry out the procedure through ve graviton interactions; in principle, the procedure can be carried
out to arbitrarily high orders, although as a practical matter the complexity of the computations
increases rapidly with the number of gravitons. nevertheless, the procedure shows that a lagrangian
for gravity can be obtained using qcd amplitudes. the gravity lagrangian obtained in this way has
the properties that (a) by construction it produces the correct tree-level amplitudes and (b) graviton
lorentz indices associated with the left gauge theory do not contract with ones associated with the
right gauge theory. a lagrangian with the property that the associated feynman diagrams factorize
into left and right parts has been presented previously by siegel [10]. a spin-o from our analysis
is that it can be used to provide a simpler set of gravity feynman rules than the conventional [11]
de donder gauge rules. moreover, in our construction, the gravity three vertex is given directly as
sums of squares of gauge theory vertices.

in the second part, we will nd a set of eld variables which allows us to interpret the gravity
lagrangian obtained from qcd in terms of the conventional einstein-hilbert lagrangian. non-
linear eld redenitions and gauge xings have been used previously by van de ven [12] to simplify
the computation of two-loop divergences in gravity. here we wish to consider such eld redenitions
and gauge xings in order to nd a particular set of eld variables which helps clarify the connection
to qcd. this construction indicates that there is a closer correspondence between ordinary gauge
invariance and the dieomorphism invariance of einstein gravity than one might have suspected.

2 review of the klt relations and applications

a basic property of integrands for closed string amplitudes is that they factorize into open string
integrands (except for the momentum zero mode). at tree-level, klt [1] used this property to
nd simple relationships expressing closed string amplitudes in terms of products of open string
amplitudes.
in the innite string tension limit where string theory reduces to an eective eld
theory, for the four- and ve-point amplitudes these relations are,

where, 2 = 32gn , sij = (ki + kj)2, the an are color-ordered gauge theory partial amplitudes [13]
and the mn are gravity amplitudes. color does not appear in these relations because the gauge
theory partial amplitudes are independent of color. the arguments of the amplitudes label the

2

external legs. these relations hold for any particle states appearing in any closed string theory since
they follow from the basic factorization of the string integrands into left and right sectors. in
particular, they hold in pure einstein gravity, gravity coupled to a dilaton, anti-symmetric tensor or
gauge eld, and in supergravity theories. moreover, these klt relations generalize to an arbitrary
number of external legs. (explicit expressions may be found in appendix a of ref. [5].) a basic
property of the klt formulas is that any lorentz indices associated with the left gauge theory
amplitude do not contract with the lorentz indices of the right gauge theory amplitude.

the klt relations give tree-level gravity amplitudes directly from known gauge theory ampli-
tudes, which are generally far easier to compute. this was rst applied by berends, giele and
kuijf [2] to obtain an innite sequence of maximally helicity violating n-point einstein gravity
tree amplitudes using known qcd gluon amplitudes. beyond tree-level, one may exploit the klt
relations using the cutting method developed for performing qcd amplitude calculations of phe-
nomenological interest [9]. with this method one can reconstruct complete loop amplitudes (in a
given dimensional regularization scheme) from their d-dimensional unitarity cuts. the one-loop
amplitudes are specied in terms of tree amplitudes which satisfy the klt relations; one can then
obtain higher loop amplitudes by iterating the procedure. in this way, one can obtain loop-level
(super) gravity s-matrix elements without reference to a lagrangian or feynman rules [3, 4, 5].
the eciency of the computational method follows from the fact that one is recycling previously
performed gauge theory calculations to obtain new results in gravity theories.

figure 1: one can recycle tree amplitudes into loop amplitudes via d-dimensional unitarity cuts.

for example, consider the unitarity cuts of a one-loop four-point amplitude in any gravity theory
coming from the low energy limit of a string theory. as depicted in g. 1, a gravity tree amplitude
appears on each side of the cut. thus, on the cut one must evaluate the product,

summed over all states in the gravity theory that can cross the cut. from the klt relations (1) we

the sum over the gravity theory states necessarily factorize into a sum over the states of two gauge
theories because the underlying string theory has this property. this is a generic property holding
for all cuts. in this way, one can re-express cut gravity amplitudes in terms of gauge theory ones.
this has led to the construction of a number of non-trivial gravity loop amplitudes [3, 4, 5].

3 construction of a gravity lagrangian from qcd

we now discuss a procedure for constructing an o-shell low energy lagrangian for pure gravity
starting from qcd gluon amplitudes. we explicitly carry this out for up to ve graviton interactions.
by construction, the lagrangian that we obtain is equivalent to the einstein-hilbert lagrangian in
that it produces identical tree-level s-matrix elements.

in eld theory one usually takes a given lagrangian and constructs feynman rules that can then
be used to obtain the s-matrix elements. here we wish to reverse this process, since from the klt
relations we have the gravity s-matrix in terms of qcd amplitudes, but wish instead to obtain a
lagrangian that preserves the left-right factorization of lorentz indices.

to obtain the n-graviton term in the lagrangian we start with the tree-level n-graviton ampli-
tudes, given in terms of the qcd amplitudes, and subtract all diagrams containing up to (n  1)-
graviton interaction vertices. by iterating this procedure we can systematically build a gravity
lagrangian. however, to jump-start this process we rst need a propagator and three vertex.

consider the graviton propagator. the standard de donder gauge propagator,

p;(k) = hhhi0 =

1

2h  +  

2

d  2

i

i

k2 + i

,

(4)

is unacceptable since it contracts left and right indices; for example, the last term contracts  with
. moreover, it contains explicit dependence on the dimension d, which must somehow cancel from
the tree-level s-matrix elements since there is no such dependence in the klt relations or in the
gauge theory amplitudes. (we have chosen  to have signature (+,,,).) a better propagator
is [14]

p;(k) =

i
2

  + 

k2 + i

.

(5)

however, even this propagator is unacceptable because of the second term, which contracts a left
index with a right one. to prevent such contractions, we wish to use instead the propagator,

p;(k) =  

i

k2 + i

.

(6)

in a sense, for each graviton h we assign the index  to be a left index and  to be a right
index. of course, since h is symmetric it does not matter which index is assigned to the left and
which to the right, but once the choice is made we demand that left indices never contract with right
ones. at rst sight the gravity propagator (6) might seem rather peculiar since it appears to violate
the fundamental property of the graviton being a symmetric tensor eld. nevertheless, it is not
dicult to show that one may use the propagator (6) instead of (5) with no eect on the n-graviton
s-matrix elements, provided that all vertices satisfy a rigid leftright interchange symmetry. by a
rigid symmetry we mean that each n-point vertex be symmetric under a simultaneous interchange
of all left and right lorentz indices,

v 12n;12n
n

(k1, k2, . . . , kn) = v 12n;12n

n

(k1, k2, . . . , kn) ,

(7)

where the i are the left indices associated with each graviton and the i are the right indices.

4

with this requirement, one can show that there is no need to symmetrize the graviton propagator
in the left and right indices. consider, for example, the diagram in g. 2. the external legs of the
diagrams do not need to be explicitly symmetrized since the external graviton polarization tensors
automatically symmetrize the legs. the interchange of the  and  indices can be undone by
performing a rigid interchange of left and right indices on the left-most vertex. although the rigid
interchange will also ip the indices on the external legs, this can be undone since the indices of each
external leg are contracted with a symmetric tensor polarization. the same type of argument works
for general diagrams. thus, the propagator (6) can be used instead of the propagator (5) since the
symmetrization of indices is automatically taken care of by the rigidly symmetrized vertices and by
the symmetric polarization tensors on the external legs.







figure 2: a sample diagram for showing that we may use propagator (6) instead of (5).

given the propagator (6) we must also choose a three vertex. any three vertex which agrees
on shell with the three-graviton vertex is suitable for our purposes. (kinematic restrictions prevent
a massless particle from decaying into two others, but in terms of formal polarization tensors the
vertex does not vanish; below we shall also obtain the same vertex from the einstein-hilbert action.)
from string theory (see e.g. ref. [8]), the on-shell three-graviton vertex can be expressed in terms of
products of gauge theory vertices. this motivates the choice of the three graviton vertex,

is the color ordered gervais-neveu [15] yang-mills three vertex, from which the color factor has been
stripped. our main reasons for using the vertex (8) is its simplicity and the fact that it makes the
relationship to gauge theory manifest. by construction, this vertex is symmetric under the rigid
interchange of left and right indices.

armed with the propagator (6) and the three vertex (8) we may then use the klt relations to
nd a gravity lagrangian using qcd gluon amplitudes as input. at the rst step of the process one
denes a four-vertex by subtracting from the four-point s-matrix obtained via the klt relations
all diagrams containing a kinematic pole, as shown in g. 3. this four vertex automatically has the
property that left lorentz indices do not contract with right ones, since the gravity s-matrix and
diagrams containing the three-point vertex (8) have this property. moreover, the vertex dened in
this way also has the rigid symmetry under an interchange of left and right indices.

we may then convert this four-vertex to an h4 term in the lagrangian by inverting the usual
procedure of obtaining feynman vertices from lagrangians. of course, there is some ambiguity in
this process since one can always add terms which vanish on shell. as long as these terms do not mix
left and right lorentz indices and satisfy a rigid left-right symmetry, which can always be imposed

figure 3: one can obtain a four vertex with the left-right factorization property by subtracting the diagrams
containing the kinematic poles from the s-matrix.

by hand, they are acceptable terms; dierences in the four-vertex then induce dierences in the
deduced higher-point vertices.

once the four-graviton terms in the lagrangian have been chosen we can then continue the pro-
cess to obtain a ve vertex by subtracting from the ve-graviton amplitude all diagrams containing
three- and four-point vertices. in principle, one can continue in this way to an arbitrary number of
external legs, allowing one to build a lagrangian for gravity order by order in perturbation theory
using qcd gluon amplitudes. by construction this lagrangian has the property that it generates
all tree-level s-matrix elements and that it never contracts left indices with right ones.

starting from qcd gluon tree amplitudes, we have carried out the construction for up to ve

where h, = h . in minkowski space, one of any two contracted indices should be taken to be
a raised index using  , but we have suppressed this. in principle it might have been necessary
to introduce auxiliary elds for locality to hold; indeed, as discussed below, when comparing this
lagrangian to the einstein-hilbert gravity lagrangian it is useful to introduce an auxiliary dilaton.
although the lagrangian (10) is not unique since the terms can be modied by adding or subtract-
ing contributions that vanish on shell and appropriately modifying the higher-point contributions,
it is a relatively simple one. more importantly, as we shall see below, it allows for a relatively
straightforward match to the conventional einstein-hilbert lagrangian. by adjusting the four-point
terms in the lagrangian we have found a solution for l5 that contains only six terms, but then the
connection to the einstein-hilbert lagrangian is a bit more complicated.

for compactness we have removed the rigid symmetrization between left and right indices; how-

6

ever, if one uses the propagator (6), each vertex must be rigidly symmetrized between left and right
indices, e.g.,



l3 

2hh h, h + hh,h, + h h,h,i .

(11)

although we do not explicitly give the generated feynman rules here, it is quite straightforward
to obtain these. the advantages of using feynman rules generated by this lagrangian instead of
the conventional de donder gauge rule are clear: besides the fact that one can use the propagator
(6) instead of the more complicated de donder gauge propagator (4) the three-, four- and ve-
point vertices are quite a bit simpler than the corresponding de donder gauge vertices. once the
interaction terms have been rigidly symmetrized, when deriving the feynman rules we can in a
sense treat h as a tensor eld with no special index symmetry. note that the feynman diagrams
generated by this lagrangian do not contain explicit factors of d. in the conventional de donder
gauge such factors do appear, but somehow cancel from the s-matrix elements.

the relative simplicity of these feynman rules is related to the preservation of the s matrix
property that left and right lorentz indices should not contract with each other. although the klt
relations might appear to suggest that eld variables exist where gravity can be reformulated as a
polynomial theory with no more than four-point interactions as in the gauge theory case, we have
been unsuccessful in nding such a lagrangian.

the lagrangian (10) does contain general coordinate invariance although it is not manifest since
the symmetry has been gauge xed. to make this explicit, we now relate the lagrangian (10) to the
usual einstein-hilbert one. in order to do so we must rst eliminate all terms in the einstein-hilbert
lagrangian which contract left with right graviton indices, i.e,

h ,

h hh ,

 ,

tr[h2m+1] ,

(12)

where tr[hn]  h12 h23  hn1. because of the way that these types of terms are tangled in
the einstein-hilbert lagrangian, it is not obvious how one can accomplish this. nevertheless, the
existence of the lagrangian (10) implies that there must be some rearrangement with the desired
property.

in ref. [14] the dilaton was introduced to allow for a eld redenition which removes the graviton
trace from the quadratic terms in the lagrangian. the appearance of the dilaton as an auxiliary
eld to help rearrange the lagrangian is motivated by string theory which requires the presence
of such a eld. following the discussion of ref. [14], we then consider the lagrangian for gravity
coupled to a dilaton,

leh =

2
2

g r + g  .

(13)

(our conventions are those of weinberg [16], except that we have ipped the signature of the metric,
g  g; this then induces an overall sign ip in the lagrangian.) in de donder gauge, for
example, taking g =  + h , the quadratic part of the lagrangian is

l2 = 

1
2

h 2h +

1
4

h2h  2 .

(14)

the term involving h can be eliminated with the simultaneous eld redenitions [14],

h  h + s 2
d  2

 ,

h +s d  2

2

1
2

 ,

 

so that the lagrangian reduces to

l2  

1
2

h 2h + 2 .

(15)

(16)

(this eld redenition is a bit dierent than the one in ref. [14] because we have chosen to normalize
the dilaton kinetic term dierently so as to slightly simplify the induced interaction terms discussed
below.)

for the case of purely graviton external states the dilaton will not contribute to the tree-level
s-matrix because of the selection rule that  must be created or annihilated in pairs. of course,
if the dilaton, or any matter elds appearing in the theory, are taken as external states they can
propagate in intermediate states. in this case, one would need to specify the precise matter content
of the theory before proceeding with the analysis. nevertheless, the fundamental factorization of the
s-matrix implied by the klt relations would still hold, since it follows from the underlying string
theory.

here we wish to generalize the eld redenitions (15) to all orders in  so as to remove all terms

of the form (12) from the lagrangian. our generalization for the case of no gauge xing is

g = eq 2

d2 

e h  eq 2

d2 (cid:16) + h +

2
2

hh + (cid:17) ,

where h is the graviton eld, followed by the change of variables

  s 2

d  2(cid:16) +

1
2

h(cid:17) .

(17)

(18)

we have veried through o(h6) that this choice eliminates all terms (12) which mix left and right
lorentz indices, even before xing the gauge. as yet we have not performed any gauge xing so the
action is generally coordinate invariant, even if the choice of eld variables obscures this.

one might be concerned that the eld redenition (17) would alter the gravity s-matrix. how-
ever, the s-matrix is guaranteed to be invariant under non-linear eld redenitions or under linear
ones that do not alter the coupling to the external traceless polarization tensors. indeed, our explicit
calculations respect this property, as required.

an important remaining question is how one can choose a gauge xing so that the terms in
the einstein-hilbert lagrangian resemble the terms of the lagrangian (10) deduced from the qcd
amplitudes. we have found a solution, which is to replace the eld redenition (18) with a non-linear
generalization,

then we add a gauge xing term to the lagrangian, (f)2 following the standard procedure, where

(20)
with these choices we then obtain the desired form of the lagrangian through o(h4), which we

for the case of pure graviton external states we may integrate out  from the path integral.

equivalently, we may substitute the equation of motion for ,

(22)

into the lagrangian. for the two- and three-graviton terms in the lagrangian, this gives exactly the
terms in the lagrangian (10). for the four-point we obtain exactly l4 plus a non-local piece that
vanishes for on-shell gravitons,

l4 =

(23)

since the four-point lagrangians dier a bit o-shell, at the ve-point level, terms that are non-zero

in a sense we may take leh as the more fundamental one since it comes directly from the
einstein-hilbert lagrangian, while the lagrangian in eq. (10) provides the guidance needed to
obtain it. this shows the connection of the lagrangian obtained from qcd (10) and the einstein-
hilbert lagrangian for a very particular set of eld variables and and gauge xing. although the
two lagrangians dier somewhat even after integrating out the auxiliary dilaton, we have explicitly
shown that for up to ve gravitons they generate the same on-shell scattering amplitudes.

presumably, similar results can be obtained without introducing the dilaton; nevertheless, we
found it useful for clarifying the required reorganization of the einstein-hilbert lagrangian. other
reorganizations based on introducing other elds such as an anti-symmetric tensor, which is also
motivated by string theory, are also possible [10].

at loop level there are also ghost contributions that can be obtained via the usual methods.
(the jacobian generated by the eld redenition is trivial, at least in perturbation theory, since it

9

is a point transformation.) additionally the auxiliary dilaton would propagate in the loops, which
would then need to be subtracted (see e.g., ref. [14]). at loop level the unitarity method advocated
in refs. [9, 3, 4, 5] is, however, an ecient way to obtain the s-matrix without the need for feynman
rules.

4 sample applications

as one simple application, one may obtain the soft factor for gravity amplitudes directly from the
soft behavior of qcd amplitudes. gravity tree amplitudes have the well known behavior [17],

mtree

n (1, 2, . . . , n+) kn0


2 s gravity(n+)  mtree

n1(1, 2, . . . , n  1) ,

(25)

as the momentum of graviton n, which we have taken to carry positive helicity, becomes soft. using
the three-graviton vertex (8) which is expressed in terms of the qcd three-gluon vertex, the gravity
soft factor can then be expressed in terms of the qcd soft factor:

s gravity(n+) =

n1

xi=1

sni s qcd(ql, n+, i)  s qcd(qr, n+, i) ,

(26)

where s qcd(q, n+, i) = hq ii /hq nihn ii is the eikonal factor for a positive helicity soft gluon in qcd.
the hi ji = hi|j+i are spinor inner products and |ii are massless weyl spinors of momentum ki,
labeled with the sign of the helicity (see e.g., [13]). although not manifest, the soft factor (26)
is independent of the choices of null helicity reference momenta ql and qr. by choosing ql = k1
and qr = kn1 we recover the form of the soft graviton factor for kn  0 used in, for example,
refs. [2, 4, 5].

as a less trivial example, the explicit factorization of the left and right indices of the interaction
vertices would imply that the all-plus helicity graviton current satisfying eqs. (b.10) and (b.11) of
ref. [5] do actually follow from einstein gravity. in ref. [5] the hitch in obtaining these recursion
relations from einstein gravity was the dierent choices of helicity reference momenta on the left
and on the right. (although, not derived directly from einstein gravity these recursion relations
were useful for dening half-soft functions which serve as building blocks for one-loop gravity
amplitudes.) in this case, 
+ 6= 0, which prevented a derivation of the recursion relations from
einstein gravity. with the factorization of left and right lorentz indices, such contractions simply
do not occur.

5 discussion

since the tree-level s-matrix is generated by solving perturbatively the classical equations of motion,
one might suspect that it is possible to relate more general solutions of the classical equations of
motion for gravity to gauge theory solutions. the property that the s-matrix can be expressed in
terms of left and right sectors is generic in string theory. for this reason, it should be possible
to extend the discussion in this letter to theories containing, for example, the anti-symmetric tensor

10

or to supergravity theories. it also seems reasonable that gravity theories in curved spaces can be
reformulated to express tree-level amplitudes in terms of gauge theory ones. moreover, the intimate
connection of perturbative gravity amplitudes with gauge theory ones suggests a closer connection
of dieomorphism invariance with non-abelian gauge symmetry than one might have suspected. we
feel that these issues deserve further attention.
