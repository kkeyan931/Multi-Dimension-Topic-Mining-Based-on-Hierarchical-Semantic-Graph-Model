(2) f abc denotes structure constants gauge group, supposed compact lie group elds belong adjoint representation. aa gauge eld. now, briey review connections action (1) dierent two dimensional theories. (i) first, following , consider action = zm d2x(cid:16) 2 2 aa 1 2 af (cid:17), (3) plays role coupling constant. integrating eld partition function using gaussian integral identity z = z dadaa es, z + dx 1 2 exp( 2 2 x2 ixy) = exp( y2 22 ), (4) (5) one easily see action (3) gives rise partition function 2d yangmills action. moreover, vanishing coupling constant 0 action (3) reduces 2here conventions: denote spacetime metric g , inverse g deter- minant g. scalar density g weight +1, whereas volume element density d2x weight -1, means invariant volume element dv = gd2x vanishing weight, transforms scalar dieomorphisms. 3for levicivita density choose 12 = 1. furthermore, = g1gg, weight +1 weight -1. 3 2 zm af . (6) hence, limit ( 0) 2d yangmills action (6) lead partition function z. (ii) second consider 3d topological chernsimons theory c.s = 1 2 z d3x(aa aa + 1 3 f abcaa ab ac ), (7) indices , 3d spacetime indices. compactify chern simons model (7) circle, get two dimensional theory described exactly action form (1) eld nothing third component 3d gauge eld aa compactied direction.

(31) ( obtain ghost equation, one simply integrate spacetime quantity ca ) use gauge condition (29). end section displaying algebraic structure model. first, consider arbitrary local functional depending elds (aa , a, ca, ca, ba, a, la, a, g, g, 1, 2, 4 ), one derive following nonlinear algebra 3 , s(w ()) + w nw (),w () ()) + w nw (),w nw (),w ss() = 0, ()s() = 0, ()o = w ()s() = w ()o = w ( )o = 0. s(w (), (), (), (32) second, functional obeys slavnov identity well two ward identities dieomorphisms local susylike symmetry, get linear oshell algebra {ss,s} = 0, ()o = 0, nss,w ()o = w nw (),w ()o = w ns,w ()o = w nw (),w ( )o = 0. nw (),w here, used following notation (), (), (),  = + ,  = .

(60) hand, trivial counterterm (59) would depend transformation parameters present (43). requirement (59) must independent two transformation parameters reduces trivial counterterm 13 simpler form d2x (aa + laca aaa ), (61) = sz , constant. so, possible deformation total action (21) general form = c + . (62) constructing counterterm (62) took account constraints (35)(40) except ghost equation (37). fact, expression (62) violates (37) unless constant coecients appearing (62) vanish. therefore action (21) admits defor- mations quantities present classical level remain receive corrections. furthermore, constraints hold quantum level symmetries broken, complete absence deformations would imply absence quantum corrections. case theory said nite. 4 anomaly analysis last point discussed possibility extending analysis orders perturbation theory. fact allowed anomalies absent . three conditions (35), (36) (37) proven renormalizable orders perturbation theory using arguments  . concerning slavnov identity two ward identities dieomorphisms local susylike symmetry, anomaly, generating functional vertex functions = + o(h) must due nilpotency get new cohomology problem = a. = 0, integrated local polynomial form degree 2 ghost number 1. = zm 1 2. (63) (64) (65) now, using strategy explained previous section, get following set descent equations 01 02 2 + d2 1 + d3 03 1 = 0, 0 = 0, 0 = 0. 14 (66) last equation (66) solved 3 0 = xn=0 xm=0 xr=0 n,m,rt r(ncmcrc).
