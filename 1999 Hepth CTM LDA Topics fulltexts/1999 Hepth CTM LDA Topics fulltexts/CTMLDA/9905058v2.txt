abstract

the topological structure of the nieh-yan form in 4-dimensional manifold
is given by making use of the decomposition of spin connection. the case of
the generalized nieh-yan form on 2d-dimensional manifold is discussed with
an example of 8-dimensional case studied in detail. the chiral anomaly with
nonvanishing torsion is studied also. the further contributions from torsional
part to chiral anomaly are found coming from the zeroes of some elds under
pure gauge condition.

i. introduction

torsion might be the most unusual eld in physics. though it has been under investiga-
tion for more than two thirds of a century, there is no general agreement on its mathematical
formulation nor on its physical signicance. vast funds of work on torsion had been done by
many physicists (see [111] for examples) since it was proposed by e. cartan [12] in 1920s.
consider a compact manifold m with metric g. there are two dynamically independent
dx. the curvature and torsion

 dx and vielbein ea = ea

one-forms: the connection ab = ab
2-forms are dened by

rab = dab  ac  cb
t a = dea  ab  eb.

(1)
(2)

in geometry, ab and ea reect the ane and metric properties of m. while in physics,
curvature and torsion may be related to energy momentum tensor and spin current respec-
tively.

nieh and yan [13] rstly gave the 4-dimensional torsional invariant 4-form as

n = t a  t a  rab  ea  eb.

(3)

this is the only nontrivial locally exact 4-from which vanishes in the absence of torsion and
is clearly independent of the pontryagin and euler densities. in any local patch where the
vielbein is well dened, n can be written as

(4)
and therefore is locally exact. the 3-form ea  t a is a chern-simons-like form that can be
used as a lagrangian for the dreibein in three dimension.. the dual of this 3-form in four
dimensions is also known as the totally antisymmetric part of the torsion and is sometimes
also referred to as h-torsion,

n = d(ea  t a)

ea  t at.

(5)

this component of the torsion tensor is the one that couples to the spin 1/2 elds [7].

recently, there have been some discussion on the question of further contributions to the
chiral anomaly in the presence of space-time with torsion [511]. it is shown the nieh-yan
form does contribute to the chiral anomaly for massive eld. this further anomaly term
is associated with vacuum polarization diagrams with two external axial torsion vertices,
rather than with the usual triangle diagrams [11].

in this paper, by making use of the decomposition theory of so(n) spin connection (see
[16] for example) reviewed in section 2, we give the topological structure of nieh-yan form
in 4-dimensional manifold in section 3. the nieh-yan number is found to be the sum of
indices of some eld  at its zeroes. the hopf indices and brouwer degrees of  label the
local properties of the nieh-yan form. we also present the relationship between nieh-yan
number and winding number. in section 4, a general discussion on the cases of generalized
nieh-yan form on 2d-dimensional manifold is given with a elaborate study on 8-dimensional
case as an example. by applying the results obtained to chiral anomaly, it is found under
pure gauge condition, contributions of chiral anomaly come only from the zeroes of some
eld l(r) and  in section 5. at last, we give a short conclusion in section 6.

ii. the decomposition theory of spin connection

in this section, we will give a short review of the decomposition theory of so(n) which
is an useful tool in the discussion of the topological structure of nieh-yan form in the later
sections.

a smooth vector eld a (a = 1, 2,   , n) can be found on the base manifold m (a

section of a vector bundle over m). we dene a unit vector n on m as

na = a/||||

a = 1, 2,   , n

(6)

|||| = aa,

in which the superscript a is the local orthonormal frame index. in fact n is identied as
a section of the sphere bundle over m (or a partial section of the vector bundle over m).
we see that the zeroes of  are just the singular points of n.

let the n-dimensional dirac matrix a (a = 1, 2,   , n) be the basis of the cliord

algebra which satises

an unit vector eld n on m can be expressed as a vector of cliord algebra

ab + ba = 2ab.

n = naa,

(7)

(8)

the spin connection 1-form and curvature 2-form are respectively represented as cliord-
algebra-valued dierential forms

 =

1
2

abiab

f =

1
2

f abiab,

in which iab is the generator of the spin representations of the group so(n)

iab =

1
4

[a, b] =

1
4

(ab  ba).

the covariant derivative 1-form of na can be represented in terms of n and 

and curvature 2-form

dn = dn  [, n],

f = d    .

arbitrary u  spin(n), which satises

uu  = u u = i,

(9)

(10)

(11)

(12)

(13)

is an even-versor [14]. the induced spinorial transformation by u to the basis i of the
cliord algebra give n orthonormal vectors ui [15] via

3

ui := uiu  = ua

i a,

(14)

where ua
ship between u and ua
i. by (14), it is easy to verify that ui satisfy

i is the coecient of ui in the representation of cliord algebra. from the relation-
i , we see that ui has the same singular points with respect to dierent

i, j = 1, 2,   n.
from (11) we know that the covariant derivative 1-form of ui is

uiuj + ujui = 2ij,

there exists the following formula for a cliord algebra r-vector a [14]

dui = dui  [, ui].

uiaui = (1)r(n  2r)a.

(15)

(16)

(17)

for  is a cliord algebra 2-vector and using (17), the spin connection  can be decomposed
by n orthonormal vectors ui as

or

 =

1
4

(duiui  duiui)

ab = dua

i ub

i ub
i  dua
i.

(18)

(19)

it can be proved that the general decomposition formula (18) has global property and is
independent of the choice of the local coordinates [16].

by choosing the gauge condition

we can dene a generalized pseudo-at spin connection as

dui = 0,

0 =

1
4

duiui.

(20)

(21)

suppose there exist l singular points zi (i = 1, 2,   , l.) in the orthonormal vectors uj. one
can easily prove that at the normal points of uj

f (0) = 0

when x 6= zi.

(22)

for the derivative of ui at the singular points zi is undened, the formula (22) is invalid at
zi. hence, the curvature under the gauge condition (20) is a generalized function

f ( = 0
6= 0

when

x 6= zi,
x = zi.

.

(23)

this is why we call 0 the pseudo-at spin connection. in fact, the gauge condition (20) is
the pure gauge condition supported by the fact that one can always nd a frame which is
locally at.

4

iii. topological structure of nieh-yan form in 4-dimensional

manifold

one of the properties of topological invariant is that it is independent of connection.

therefore, we choose the pseudo-at connection

ab = dua

i ub

i

(24)

to make the calculation easier. under this gauge condition, there must exist singularity
points on the manifold if the topology of this manifold is nontrivial. using the pseudo-at
spin connection, we can rewrite torsion as

t a = dea = d(eiua

i ) = deiua

i

and nieh-yan form

where ei are the projection of vielbein onto the basis

n = d(ea  t a) = dei  dei,

ei = eaua
i .

in quaternionic representation, a four vector ~ = (1, 2, 3, 4) is written as

 = 1i + 2j + 3k + 4

 = 1i  2j  3k + 4

and the vielbein projection

e = e0 + e1i + e2j + e3k,

(25)

(26)

(27)

(28)

(29)

where (1, i, j, k) is the basis of quaternion satisfying i2 = 1, ij = k, etc. to give a frame
that is at locally, we can nd some , which make the vielbein expressed in the form

e =

l

||||2 d,

(30)

where the constant l has dimension of length. the choice of local at metric is coincide
with the pseudo-at connection chosen, which makes singular points exist for the non-trivial
topological property of the manifold..

its well known that the quaternionic representation can be expressed in terms of the

cliord algebra as

where

and

 = isi

i = 1, 2, 3, 4,

s = (i~, i),

s = (i~, i)

5

(31)

(32)

the vielbein projection can be rewritten as

e = eisi.

e =

l

||||2 d.

then we get the nieh-yan form as

n = dei  dei =

1
2

t r(de  de).

by making use of the relationship

ijkl =

1
2

t r(sisjsksl),

the nieh-yan form can be expressed in terms of an unit vector ni =

as

i
||||

n =

l2
2

t r(dn  dn  dn  dn)

= l2ijkldni  dnj  dnk  dnl.

the derivative of na can be deduced as

dni =

di

||||  id(

).

substituting it into (37), we have the expression of n on s(m)

n = l2ijkld(

(34)

(35)

(36)

(40)

(41)

(42)

noticing

we get

ijklmjkl = 6im,

n = 3l2

2

ii

(

1

x

)d4x.

the general greens-function formula [17] in  space is

2

ii

(

1

||||2 ) = 42(),

we obtain the new formulation of nieh-yan form in terms of  function ()

n = 122l2()d(/x)d4x.

(43)

(44)

(45)

(46)

suppose (x) has l isolated zeroes on m and let the ith zero be zi, it is well known from

the ordinary theory of the -function [18] that

then one obtains

() =

l

xi=1

i(x  zi)
d(/x)|x=zi

.

()d(


x

) =

l

xi=1

ii(x  zi),

(47)

(48)

where i is the positive integer (the hopf index of the ith zero) and i the brouwer degree
[19,20]

from the above deduction the following topological structure is obtained:

i = sgnd(/x)|x=zi = 1.

nn y = 122l2()d(


x

)d4x = 122l2

l

xi=1

ii(x  zi)d4x,

(49)

(50)

which means that the local structure of n is labeled by the brouwer degrees and hopf
indices, which are topological invariants. therefore the nieh-yan number nn y can be
represented as

nn y = zm

n = 122l2

ii.

l

xi=1

on another hand, we can divide m by

m = xi

mi,

7

(51)

(52)

so that mi includes only the ith singularity point zi of n(x). then we get

nn y = xi zmi
= xi imi

l2ijkldni  dnj  dnk  dnl
l2ijklni  dnj  dnk  dnl,

(53)

where mi is the boundary of mi.the equation (53) is another denition of the winding
number w (, zi) of the surface mi and the mapping (x) [22]

w (, zi) =

1

122 imi

ijklni  dnj  dnk  dnl = ii.

(54)

then the nieh-yan number nn y can further be expressed in terms of winding numbers

nn y = 122l2

w (, zi).

l

xi=1

(55)

the sum of the winding numbers can be interpreted or, indeed, dened as the degree of the
mapping (x) onto m. by (46) and (53), we have

l

xi=1

w (, zi) = zm

()d(


x

)d4x

= deg z(m)

= deg .

()d4

therefore, we get the nieh-yan number at last

nn y = 122l2

l

xi=1

w (, zi) = 122l2 deg .

(56)

(57)

from (6), we know that the zeroes of  are just the singularities of n. here (51) says
that the sum of the indices of the singular points of n, or of the zeroes of , is nieh-yan
number.

iv. higher dimensional case

in 2d-dimensional case, we can get similar results. under the pure gauge condition, the

nonvanishing term of the generalized nieh-yan form is

(dei  dei)2d2

.

(58)

the computation above is also valid in this case. the topological structure of generalized
nieh-yan form is constitute by delta function of some . the hopf indices and brouwer
degree labeled the local structure of nieh-yan form. the nieh-yan number is some constant
number times of the degree or winding numbers of .

x = xi

ii(x  zi)d2d

x.

(59)

in the following, we take only 8-dimensional case as an example.

in 8-dimensional compact manifold, under the gauge condition (20), the generalized

nieh-yan form is expressed simply as

n = d(ei  dei  dej  dej).

(60)

and the vielbein is expressed locally in terms of the octonions under cliord algebra repre-
sentation

where

e = eisi =

l

||||2 d,

 = isi

i = 1, 2, ..., 8.

(61)

in which si is the basis of octonions. substituting (61) into (60), we get the nieh-yan form

of 8-d in terms of unit vector ni =

as

i
||||

n =

l4
5

i1i2...i8dni1  dni2  ...  dni8.

(62)

analogously to 4-dimensional case, using the general greens-function formula [17] in 8-
dimensional  space, the generalized nieh-yan form is expressed as

n = 1008l4a(s7)()d(

)d8x


x
)d8x,

= 3364l4()d(


x

which can be rewritten in terms of hopf indices and brouwer degree as

n = 3364l4xi

ii(x  zi)d8x.

the nieh-yan number in 8-dimensional is

nn y = 3364l4 deg  = 3364l4xi

w (, zi).

similar results can be obtained for higher 2d-dimensional case.

v. chiral anomaly on spaces with torsion

consider a massive dirac spinor on a curved background with torsion. the action is

s = z 1

2

(d4xe  6  + h.c.) + m ,

where the dirac operator is given by

this action is invariant under rigid chiral transformations

6  = eaad.

  ei5,

(66)

(67)

(68)

where  is a real constant parameter. this symmetry leads to the classical conservation law

in which

j 

5 = 0,

5 = eea a5.
j 

the chiral anomaly when torsion is present is given by [5,11,6,8]

 < j 

5 >= a(x),

with

a(x) =

1
82  [rab  rab +

2
l2 (t a  t a  rab  ea  eb)].

(69)

(70)

(71)

(72)

the constant l is called the radius of the universe and is related to the cosmological constant
(|| = l2).

using the results obtained in section 3, we can rewritten the chiral anomaly as

 < j 

5 >=

1
82  [rab  rab] + 3()d(


x

).

from the relationship

so(4) = su(2)l  su(2)r,

(73)

(74)

the pontryagin class of so(4) group can be expressed as the sum of the second chern classes
of the left and right su(2)l(r) subgroup

t r(r  r) = t r(rsu (2)l  rsu (2)l) + t r(rsu (2)r  rsu (2)r).

by making use of the result of duan and fu [21]

1
82 t r(rsu (2)  rsu (2)) = ( )d(


x

)d4x,

10

(75)

(76)

where ` belongs to spin(3) corresponding to the group su(2). in duan and fus paper,
the pure gauge condition is used also to get the topological structure of the second chern
class for su(2) group. now we get the chiral anomaly

 < j 

5 >= ( l)d(

l
x

) + ( r)d(

r
x

) + 3()d(


x

),

(77)

in which l and r are some spin(3)l(r) element corresponding to the subgroups su(2)l(r).
furthermore, by making use of the structure of delta function, the anomaly can be formu-
lated more explicitly

 < j 

(x  zli)lili +xi

5 >= xi
(x  zli)wli +xi

= xi

(x  zri)riri + 3xi
(x  zi)wi.

(x  zri)wri + 3xi

(x  zi)ii

(78)

where l(r)i and l(r)i are the hopf indices and brouwer degrees respectively corresponding
to the zeroes of l(r), and wl(r)i is the winding number of l(r) at its ith zeroes. from
(78), we see, under pure gauge condition, the chiral anomaly comes only from the zeroes of
the elds lr and , and their winding numbers account the quantity of chiral anomaly.

vi. conclusion

in this paper, we discussed the nieh-yan form by making use of the decomposition
theory of spin connection. the nieh-yan form in 4-dimensional manifold is proved the take
the delta function form under local at gauge condition. the local topological structure of
nieh-yan form is labeled by hopf indices and brouwer degrees of eld , which is used to
expressed the vielbein under local at (or pure) gauge condition. the nieh-yan number is
proved to be an constant number times the degree or winding number of .

a general discussion of the generalized nieh-yan form on 2d-dimensional manifold is
presented. from an example of 8-dimensional case, we found the topological structure of
the generalized nieh-yan form is similar to the 4-dimensional case in terms of eld  under
pure gauge condition. it is noticeable that the cliord algebra can make the calculus more
easier in these cases.

the topological anomaly with nonvanishing torsion is formulated explicitly under pure
gauge condition. there are two kinds of contribution in the anomaly that comes from the
topology of the manifold: the pontryagin class of so(4) and the nieh-yan form. we proved
each of them to be a sum of delta function of some elds l(r) and  under pure gauge
condition. it means the contribution comes only from the zeroes of l(r) or . the degrees
or winding numbers of l(r) or  give the quantity of contributions.
