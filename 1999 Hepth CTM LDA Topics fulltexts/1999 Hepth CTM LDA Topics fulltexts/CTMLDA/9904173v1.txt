we investigate and contrast the nonperturbative infra red structure of
n = 1 and n = 2 supersymmetric noncompact u(1) gauge eld theory in
three spacetime dimensions with n matter avours. we study the dyson
schwinger equations in a general gauge using supereld formalism; this en-
sures that supersymmetry is kept manifest, though leads to spurious infra red
divergences which we have to avoid carefully. in the n = 1 case the supereld
formalism allows us to choose a vertex which satises the u(1) ward iden-
tity exactly, and we nd the expected critical behaviour in the wavefunction
renormalization and strong evidence for the existence of a gauge indepen-
dent dynamically generated mass, but with no evidence for a critical avour
number. we study the n = 2 model by dimensional reduction from four
dimensional n = 1 electrodynamics, and we rene the old gauge dependence
argument that there is no dynamical mass generation. we recognize that the
renement only holds after dimensional reduction.

i. introduction.

dynamical mass generation is an interesting strongcoupling phenomenon which requires
nonperturbative methods, and has been studied extensively in navour noncompact
u(1) gauge theory in three dimensions (qed3) [17]. in this nonsupersymmetric model
the dynamics drives the coupling to a nontrivial xed point in the infra red [6,7]: this leads
to dynamical mass generation (and hence chiral symmetry breaking) and critical behaviour
in the normal (chirally symmetric) phase.

the situation for supersymmetric versions of electrodynamics is less clear. in an early
work on three dimensional n = 2 supersymmetric qed, it was argued using component

1

formalism that (at least in landau gauge) a dynamical mass is generated [1]. it was pointed
out that the vanishing of the eective potential in supersymmetric eld theories meant that
the question of energetic favourability could not be answered simply; it was conjectured that
the issue of the selection of the nite solution over the vanishing one might be resolved at
the level of the eective action, and the ward identities arising from the supersymmetry [1].
however, it has been argued on the grounds of gauge dependence that a (nonperturbative)
nonrenormalization theorem in four dimensional n = 1 supersymmetric electrodynamics
forbids the dynamical generation of mass [8]. on dimensional reduction, four dimensional
n = 1 supersymmetry reduces to three dimensional n = 2 extended supersymmetry, and
so the nonrenormalization theorem should also hold for the three dimensional extended
model. recently there has been speculation that the gauge dependence argument for the
four dimensional model is not sound [9, 10]. the analysis of the four dimensional model
employs a simplied form of the u(1) ward identity, and a heavily truncated vertex [8].
this is because in four dimensions supersymmetry and u(1) gauge invariance require, in
addition to the usual three point vertex, npoint vertices for all n > 3 (see section vii).
this problem does not arise in the three dimensional n = 1 model, where supersymmetry
and u(1) gauge invariance require three and fourpoint vertices only. recently there has
been evidence from numerical studies [11] that the n = 2 model does not generate a mass
dynamically, in line with the dimensional reduction of the nonrenormalization theorem,
but in contradistinction to the results of reference [1].

an early work on n = 1 supersymmetric qed in three dimensions demonstrated that
troublesome logarithmic divergences present in the wavefunction renormalization of non
supersymmetric qed3 are absent in the supersymmetric model, and it was argued that
this allowed dynamical mass generation to take place for numbers of avours less than a
critical number [12], which was related to the critical avour number of nonsupersymmetric
qed3 [2]. the analysis was done in component formalism, in landau gauge and with a trivial
threepoint vertex (set to unity) which does not satisfy the u(1) ward identity except in
the limits of zero transferred momentum and trivial (unit) wavefunction renormalization.
it is therefore of interest to look more closely at the infra red structure of both n = 1
and n = 2 supersymmetric u(1) gauge eld theory. the actual dynamically generated mass
is the p  0 limit of the mass function and is the pole of the matter two point correlation
function; as such, it must be a gauge invariant object. only if the p  0 limit leaves a
gauge independent constant can it be said with certainty that a mass has been dynamically
generated. it is therefore crucial to give a careful treatment of gauge dependence, and to
look closely at the full vertex. since supersymmetry cannot be dynamically broken in a
supersymmetric u(1) gauge eld theory [13], we do not have to consider the possibility of
dierent dynamical masses for each component of the multiplet. with these issues in mind,
we choose to work in supereld formalism, which keeps supersymmetry manifest, and we
will, as far as possible, work in a general gauge.
in components computations (see e.g.
reference [14]) it is necessary to use the u(1) ward identity and the ward identities arising
from supersymmetry to constrain the vertices: the advantage of the supereld formalism is
that we only need to examine the u(1) ward identity, for the formalism ensures that the
supersymmetry ward identities are satised. in particular, by using the supereld formalism
we will be able to choose a threepoint vertex which satises the u(1) ward identity exactly
in the n = 1 case. it is known [8, 15] that supereld formalism for gauge theories results in

2

spurious infra red divergences arising from the propagation of a gauge artifact: by careful
choice of approximations and, where necessary, gauge, we can avoid most of the infra red
divergences and they do not spoil our results.

we use the same approach to study the nonperturbative physics of both the n = 1 and
n = 2 models: we construct a nonperturbative ansatz for the matter supereld propagator,
and study the behaviour of the functions appearing therein through the dysonschwinger
equations. in principle there are dysonschwinger equations for the matter superelds, the
gauge supereld, and for the full vertex. the gauge supereld dysonschwinger equation
will be resummed to leading order in 1/n, where n is the number of matter avours; this
is exactly what is done in normal qed3. the vertex will be constrained by the u(1) ward
identity. when the results of the resummation and a choice for the vertex are put into the
dysonschwinger equation for the matter supereld, coupled integral equations for the self
energy and wavefunction renormalization result, which have to be solved. as with normal
qed3, approximations have to be sought in order to look for solutions of the equations.

for the n = 1 model we will present two approaches for studying the dysonschwinger
equations. first, we consider some of the simplest approximations, which are sucient
when applied to normal qed3 to demonstrate the existence of dynamical mass generation
(at least in landau gauge) [3]. the advantages of making these computationally convenient
approximations are twofold: they allow us to work in a general gauge throughout, and admit
conversion of the integral equation to an equivalent dierential equation. the dierential
equation is simple to solve, and has a gauge invariant, constant solution in the p  0
limit. the second method incorporates the full vertex, consistent with the u(1) ward
identity.
ideally we would like to probe the gauge dependence in exactly the same way
again; however, the richer structure of the integral equations arising from this approach only
admit more direct methods. in both approaches we nd the expected critical behaviour in
the wavefunction renormalization [1618]

z(p)  (cid:16) p
(cid:17)

,

  o(1/n),

(1.1)

and exhibit the possibility of a nite dynamically generated mass. in contrast to reference
[12] we nd no evidence for a critical avour number, above which there is no dynamical
mass generation.

for the n = 2 model we again make some simple approximations which allow us to probe
the gauge dependence. again we nd the expected critical behaviour in the wavefunction
renormalization (1.1), but this time we nd that there is no gauge independent dynamically
generated mass. this is based on a renement of the gauge dependence argument of ref-
erence [8]; we note that the renement relies on the existence of the scale arising from the
compactied dimension, so that the nonrenormalization theorem for the four dimensional
model [8] may still be evaded [9, 10].

in section ii we construct the action functional for a n = 1 supersymmetric theory of n
matter avours interacting with a u(1) gauge eld in supereld formalism. we also give the
dressed propagators for the model which result from this action. we construct the u(1) ward
identity in section iii using the brs method, and in section iv we construct the dyson
schwinger equations for the model, which we use to analyse the nonperturbative properties
of the theory. we present and briey discuss our simple computation in section v, in which

3

we are able to probe the gauge dependence of the mass function by making convenient
approximations in the integral equations. our more complete computation follows in section
vi, where we choose a vertex which satises the u(1) ward identity. here we cannot use
the elegant methods of section v, but we are able to demonstrate that the solution obtained
there persists in this more complete computation. to conclude this part of the paper, we also
discuss the question of whether the nite mass solution is preferred to the vanishing mass
solution, in the context of the suggestion [1] that this can be answered by appealing to the
eective action and the supersymmetry ward identities. we nd that no extra information
can be obtained in this way, in contrast to the models of references [1921] which, crucially,
have extra constraints.

we turn to the n = 2 extended model in section vii, where we build an action functional
and dressed propagators for four dimensional n = 1 supersymmetric navour electrody-
namics. we construct the dysonschwinger equations for the model in section viii and then
compactify one dimension to obtain the coupled integral equations for the three dimensional
n = 2 model we wish to analyse. we compute the wavefunction renormalization and rene
the argument of reference [8] for the nonexistence of dynamical mass generation.
we append discussion and concluding remarks in section ix, and briey contrast with
the situation in nonsupersymmetric qed3. in the appendices we collect some useful results
and basic features of n = 1 supersymmetry in three and four dimensions, which are essential
to the analysis of the models we consider.

ii. the n = 1 action.

the n = 1 rigid superspace in three dimensions can be parameterized by the usual
three spacetime coordinates and two grassmannodd coordinates arranged in the majorana
spinor , where   {1, 2} [22], which we denote collectively by the symbol z. we collect
some basic features of this n = 1 superspace and superelds in appendix a. consider
complex scalar matter superelds ,  (mappings from superspace to c) which transform
under local u(1) transformations in the familiar way:

(z)  (z) = e+ieg(z) (z),
(z)  (z)= (z) eieg(z).

(2.1)

here e is the (dimensionful) gauge coupling and g(z) must be a real scalar supereld (a
mapping from superspace to r) to preserve the supereld nature of ; in order to build an
action functional invariant under local u(1) transformations, we must construct covariant
derivatives which transform in the same way as the matter superelds themselves:

  

 = eieg(z)eieg(z).

(2.2)

the covariant derivatives can be written in terms of a real spinor (supereld) connexion

 as follows:

 = d  ie;

4

(2.3)

here d is the normal spinorial derivative, covariant with respect to supersymmetry trans-
formations [22]. the connexion transforms in the usual way under innitesimal local u(1)
transformations:

(z)  

(z) = (z) + dg(z).

(2.4)

we wish to consider a model with n = 1 supersymmetry, local u(1) gauge invariance
and n matter avours. the required action then comprises three parts: the gauge invariant
classical eld strength term for the connexion , a (lorentz) gauge xing term and a locally
u(1) invariant kinetic term for the matter superelds  and :

(2.5)

(2.6)

we have included in the matter part an implicit sum over n avours, which do not interact
with each other but interact with the same gauge eld. the parameter  is the familiar gauge
parameter; supersymmetric feynman and landau gauges are given by  = 1, 0 respectively.
from this action it is easy to derive the renormalized propagators for the matter elds and
connexion:

(p; 12) = i

z(p)d2  (p)

(p; 12) = i

1 + /|p| (cid:2)(1+)p d2  (1)c p2(cid:3) 2(12).

(2.7)

the gauge eld propagator includes the eects of massless matter loops (to leading order in
1/n) in the vacuum polarization factor [1]

(1 + /|p|)1.

both the spinor and scalar components of the matter supereld  contribute to this cor-
rection, and so the vacuum polarization is exactly twice that of nonsupersymmetric u(1)
gauge theory [1, 12], and the eective ultra violet scale  is given by

.

(2.8)

the second rank antisymmetric symbol c appearing in the gauge eld propagator acts
as a metric for spinor indices [22], (see appendix a) and we have written threevectors in
a convenient spinor notation: p is a symmetric second rank spinor. in all the above an
abbreviated superspace notation has been used where, for instance,

2(12)  2(1  2)
the interaction piece of the action is given by:

the feynman rules derived from this action are given at the end of appendix a. finally,
note that we have not used any wesszumino type gauge xing for the connexion supereld;
this is not a gauge invariant truncation (nor one which respects supersymmetry), and we
wish, as far as is possible, to investigate the full gauge dependence of the nonperturbative
correlation functions.

iii. brs invariance and ward identities.

following the brs approach, to compute the ward identities for this model we promote
the gauge xed action (2.5) to an action invariant under an enhanced gauge symmetry. the
gauge xing term in (2.5) transforms under innitesimal gauge transformations as follows:

g

1
4

(cid:0)dd2d(cid:1)  =

1


g ((cid:3)d) .

(3.1)

to make a brs invariant action, we add a ghost term to the action, whose transformation
properties cancel those of the gauge xing term:

sghost = z d3x d2 (u(cid:3)w) ,

(3.2)

where u, w are real grassmannodd scalar ghost superelds. the full action is then invariant
under the extended gauge symmetry

 = ie (w) ,
 = ie (w) ,
 = d (w) ,
u = 
w = 0;

 d,

(3.3)

here  is a real grassmannodd number. note that 2
now be written

 = 0. the generating functional can

z = z id id id idu idw eis+issis,

where

ss = z d3x d2 (j  + j + k  + u +  w) ,
s = z d3x d2 (j  + j + k  + u +  w) .

6

(3.4)

(3.5)

the set {j, j , k , , } are supereld sources; the last three are grassmannodd valued
and k is a spinor. using the fact that 2 = 0, the ward identity immediately follows

0 = z id id id idu idw eis+iss 

(cid:18)z d3x d2 (j  + j + k  + u +  w)(cid:19) .

(3.6)

to interpret this in terms of correlation functions for the model, we construct the quantum
eective action (the index c indicates a classical value):

 [c, 

c, c

, uc, wc] = i lnz [j, j , k , ,  ]
z d3x d2 (j

c + j c + k c

 + uc +  wc) ;

the sources are given by functional derivatives of the eective action

taking functional derivatives with respect to wc, 
conguration space:

c and c we obtain the ward identity in

0 = d2(y)g(x, y, z) + i1(x  z)(x  y)  i1(x  z)(z  y),

which in momentum space reads

d2(p  q)g(p, p  q, q) = i1(p)  i1(q).

(3.11)

(3.12)

the advantage of using a superspace formulation is now apparent, for using the identity

(cid:0)d2(p)(cid:1)2 = p2,

7

(3.13)

the ward identity (3.12) can be inverted.
in fact, as we shall see, the structure of the
dysonschwinger equations is such that it can always be organized so that d2(p  q) acts
to the left of the full vertex, and so the ward identity can be used exactly as it appears in
(3.12). of course, as with the non-supersymmetric u(1) theory, the ward identity does not
constrain the transverse part of the vertex, for which

d2(p  q)g(p, p  q, q) = 0.

(3.14)

since, as discussed above, the integral equations can be arranged so that the full vertex only
appears with an accompanying d2, this will not be a problem for our analysis. moreover,
in not having to invert the ward identity, we will not introduce any extra kinematical
singularities as p  q; this is known to cause problems in the nonsupersymmetric model
[23].
in principle the fourpoint vertex could also be constrained by the u(1) ward identity;
however, the form depends in a complicated way on the threepoint vertex and it is sucient
for us to choose a trivial function for our fourpoint vertex. as we will show, the graph
which includes the fourpoint vertex contributes only to the wavefunction renormalization,
and the contribution vanishes in supersymmetric feynman gauge.

iv. the dysonschwinger equations.

the nonperturbative properties of the model are determined through the dyson
schwinger equations. these equations lead to coupled integral equations for the self energy
and wavefunction renormalization, which can be solved (in principle) to yield the dynami-
cally generated mass:

m

(4.1)

the truncated dysonschwinger equation we will use is shown graphically in gure 1.

inverse propagator and the bare inverse propagator.

and the last graph is given by (p

(2)3 d21 d22 (p, 1) (cid:20)

(4.4)

our use of a symmetric second rank spinor notation for three vectors immediately implies
the following identities

c  p = 0,
q p = 

 p  q.

(4.5)

note that the second of these identities indicates that the c symbol from the fourpoint
vertex in the last graph projects out only the (1) component of the gauge eld propagator,
and indeed the entire graph would vanish in the supersymmetric feynman gauge,  = 1.
upon substitution of the propagators (2.7), the superspace integrations can be performed
using the identities above along with the relations (a1) and (a4) in appendix a. we
will present two computations in what follows: rst, a computation in which the simplest
approximations are made: g3(p, p, q) is set to z(q), and the bifurcation method is used,
in which  is set to vanish in the denominators of all the kernels. these approximations
are drastic but computationally extremely convenient, and are sucient to demonstrate the
existence of a dynamically generated mass in nonsupersymmetric u(1) gauge theory [3].
these approximations will give us enough exibility to probe the gauge dependence of the
solution. second, we present a more complete computation, in which the full threevertex
consistent with the ward identity (3.12) is used.

the treatments in the two cases follow a similar strategy: inserting the propagators (2.7)
into equations (4.4) and (4.3) along with a choice for the threepoint vertex, the superspace
parts of the integrals can be unpacked and reassembled using the identities (4.5), (a1) and
(a4) to appear as functions of {z, , p, q} multiplying the two superspace structures:

z d2 (p, ) d2(p) (p, );
z d2 (p, ) (p, ).

9

(4.6)

comparison with equation (4.2) shows that the function multiplying the rst of these struc-
tures is to be identied with the wavefunction renormalization, and that multiplying the
second with the self energy function. from this point the usual procedure followed with the
nonsupersymmetric model can be adopted to study the coupled integral equations which
multiply the structures above. the angular integrations can be performed, leaving integral
equations now over the variable |q| only, which can in principle be evaluated. in practice, the
kernels have to be approximated with lowmomentum expansions. this is justied, for the
(supersymmetric and nonsupersymmetric) model is super renormalizable, and dynamical
mass generation, if it occurs at all, occurs in the deep infra red. two methods of solution can
be employed for the resulting approximate integral equations: conversion to an equivalent
dierential equation, or direct integration with trial functions. the rst of these will be used
with our simple approximation, and the second for the more complete computation.

v. simple computation: gauge dependence.

in this section we present a computation of the wavefunction renormalization and self
energy functions based on the simplest approximations. in defence of the approximations,
they are sucient to demonstrate the existence of a dynamically generated mass in non
supersymmetric u(1) gauge theory [3]; the threepoint vertex we choose is compatible with
the ward identity only in the limit of vanishing transferred momentum (p), though it is
consistent with a nontrivial wavefunction renormalization. the results of the computation
for our model are clear: the expected critical behaviour [1618] is found for the wavefunction
renormalization, and there is a simple form for a gauge independent dynamically generated
mass. this is shown in a neat way, by converting the integral equation for the mass function
to an equivalent dierential equation, from which it is obvious that a independent constant
solution exists. it is impossible to use this neat method in the more complete computation
to follow in section vi, for the rich structure of the integral equation resulting from the full
vertex prohibits the conversion to a dierential equation.

in the approximation g3 = z(q) the superspace parts of the integrals can be unpacked
as described above, yielding the following integral equations for the wavefunction renormal-
ization and self energy function (k(q)

a. wavefunction renormalization.

the rst of equations (5.5) can be integrated directly, to obtain the wavefunction renor-
malization in the normal phase (where there is no mass generation) and as an approximation
to the wavefunction renormalization when there is mass generation:

this critical behaviour is qualitatively the same as that found in nonsupersymmetric elec-
trodynamics [17,18], so this gives us condence in our approach, and demonstrates that the
rough qualitative behaviour is exhibited even within the drastic approximation scheme used
here. the nontrivial wavefunction renormalization we have found here is to be contrasted
with the early results of reference [12] in which the wavefunction renormalization was taken
to be unity.

b. self energy.

turning now to the self energy function, we wish to construct an equivalent dierential

equation for the mass function

m(p; ) =

(p; )
z(p; )

;

this is achieved by dierentiating the second integral equation (5.5) twice with respect to p
and once with respect to . the reason we take an extra derivative with respect to  is that
this will allow us to probe the gauge dependence of the solution directly, without having to
fully solve the equation, for we are only interested in the gauge dependence of the solution.
first we rescale variables as p 7 p and m(p) 7 m(p) and then the resulting dierential
equation is:

( m) +

n2 m = 0;

(5.8)

the superior point denotes a derivative with respect to  and primes denote derivatives with
respect to p.

demanding that m = 0 for all values of p (in the infra red) yields the solution

m(p) = m0ep2/2

,

(5.9)

which is obviously constant and independent in the p  0 limit. we should be cautious,
however, for the approximation of neglecting the mass function in the denominators might
not be consistent with this limit. when, in the next section, we use the full vertex and
restore the mass in the denominators, we will be able to show that this solution appears
to persist in the limit p  0, conrming our assertion here. it is interesting to note that
there are no solutions to (5.8) which are gauge independent in the limit p  0 but gauge
dependent elsewhere (this can be shown by developing a gauge dependent power series for
m and then constraining the gauge dependence via the indicial equation): this contrasts the
case of nonsupersymmetric qed3, in which such solutions do appear to exist, and seem to
lead to a critical avour number. we will return to a full discussion of this issue in section
ix.

12

c. concluding remarks.

the approximations we have used in this section are rather drastic, but the results
obtained are neat and transparent: the wavefunction renormalization exhibits the expected
critical behaviour [1618]

z(p)  (cid:16) p
(cid:17)

,

1
n

,

 

and we nd a gauge independent solution for the dynamically generated mass

m(p) = m0ep2/2

.

(5.10)

(5.11)

these results are in line with those found in nonsupersymmetric qed3, though we have no
evidence here for a critical avour number above which no mass generation occurs, which is
the case in the nonsupersymmetric model. this contrasts the results of reference [12], in
which a critical avour number was found. we discuss this issue further in section ix after
we have presented our full computation.

had we not used the bifurcation method in this section, the resulting dierential equation
for the mass function would have been nonlinear. what is curious is that the bifurcation
method works so well: as we will show, the solutions derived above are entirely consistent
with the full vertex and the restoration of the mass in the denominators of the kernel.
the inaccuracies arising from regions of integration where the bifurcation method is least
reliable are suppressed in the limits considered for the determination of the dynamical mass
(i.e. vanishing p).

vi. full computation.

in this section we turn to our more complete computation, where we use a threepoint
vertex consistent with the u(1) ward identity (3.12). the trick we use is to rewrite p 2 =
d4(p ) in the gauge eld propagator, and then integrate by parts until the d2(p ) operators
appear acting on the threepoint vertex g3, so that the ward identity (3.12) can be used
as it appears. when this is done, the superspace parts of the integral equations can be
unpacked as described in section iv and reconstructed after some algebra to obtain the
coupled integral equations (in which we have already performed the angular integrations):

again, the seagull graph gives an irrelevant p independent contribution to z, equation (5.2),
and also vanishes in the supersymmetric feynman gauge. since much of our nal analysis will
have to be restricted to this gauge (or at least to approximations equivalent to considering
this gauge), even if we were to make a pdependent ansatz for g4, the contribution would
vanish on account of the c  tensor structure in the vertex projecting out only the (1)
component of the gauge eld propagator.
to derive the integral equations we have used the following taylor expansion for operators

of the form d2(p + r) when acting on (p, ):

d2(p + r) = d2(p) +

r (cid:20)

rr d2(r)(cid:21)r=p

.

(6.3)

note that this is an exact expansion, which terminates at second order. the curious extra
factors of one half which appear in the expansion arise on account of the second of equations
(4.5) which puts a factor of two into the dot product of two threevectors. when acting on
(p, ) we drop terms which involve derivatives with respect to r, for these correspond to
higher derivative terms, which should be irrelevant for our study of the infra red physics.

to study the integral equations it is again necessary to approximate the logarithms with
small momentum expansions, and we obtain approximate integral equations for  and z,
in which we have used the abbreviated notations:

(6.6)

the kernels are infra red singular; this arises from the propagation of a supersymmetric gauge
artifact [15], namely the lowest component of the gauge supereld; this singular behaviour
in the infra red is a general problem for superspace formulations of gauge eld theories, but
is absent in supersymmetric feynman gauge [8]. note that the singular terms as p  q are
regulated on account of the vanishing of the functions q and s in this same limit.
it is also evident from equations (6.5) and (6.6) that it is impossible to derive from them
an equivalent dierential equation (not even within the bifurcation method) on account of
the presence of factors of z(p) and (p) in the kernels. furthermore, it is evident that
even if the factors of z(p) and (p) could be dealt with, the same problem arises from the
(p2  q2)1 terms: the integrals cannot be entirely removed by dierentiation. however,
this last problem is removed in the supersymmetric feynman gauge, in which the problem
of the gauge artifact discussed above is eliminated:
for this reason much of our analysis
will be performed in feynman gauge, or using approximations which are computationally
equivalent to this gauge.

a. wavefunction renormalization.

in the normal phase, where  = 0, the integral equation for z can be integrated directly.
we begin with the approximation z(p) = z(q), which is not quite as drastic as z = 1, but
has the same eect, namely to reduce the kernels to known functions of p and q. performing
the integrations yields the following form for z (compare with equation (5.6)):

z(p) = 1 +

n2 (cid:16) p
(cid:17)2

+ 2

(1+)

n2 ln(cid:16) p
(cid:17)

(6.7)

(6.8)

where we have used the usual renormalization group argument to resum the logarithm, and
as in equation (5.6), a is a constant of order o(1/n) and the function f vanishes at least
as fast as p/ in the limit p/  0. the critical exponent  is found to have the usual
1/n behaviour. note that the evaluation of the exponent  in this more reliable approach
diers by a factor of two from the result obtained in section v; this is of little concern for
the exponent is not a gauge invariant object. the n dependence is the crucial property,
and this is the same in both computations.

we can demonstrate that this solution is stable, by now relaxing the assumption that

z(p) = z(q), and feeding the solution

15

z(q) = (cid:16) q
(cid:17)

back into the integral equation. the parts of the integral equation which vanish in feynman
gauge now give divergent contributions, in the form of hypergeometric functions evaluated
at the limit of their radius of convergence, and divergent logarithms from the remaining
singularities at p = q. these singularities are again a consequence of the propagation
of a supersymmetric gauge artifact; they can be successfully avoided by considering the
supersymmetric feynman gauge,  = 1, in which the iterated solution reads:

z(p) =

n2 (cid:16) p
(cid:17)2

+(cid:16) p
(cid:17)

;

(6.9)

(6.10)

the critical exponent is unaltered, and the coecients of the other terms receive corrections
of order o(1/n) in the denominator. hence, for large n the solution is stable to iteration,
at least in supersymmetric feynman gauge.

b. self energy.

we turn now to the self energy, and the integral equation (6.6). as we discussed previ-
ously, it is impossible to derive an equivalent dierential equation, on account of the presence
of (p) and (p2  q2)1 terms in the kernels. we again study the equation in the feynman
gauge, which removes the diculties of the singular terms. dividing through by z(p), we
obtain the following integral equation for the mass function m(p):

. (6.11)

to study this we cannot use the usual method of setting m(p) = m(q) = m(0) everywhere
and looking for self consistent solutions, for in this limit the kernels reduce to zero. instead,
we recall the solution of the dierential equation in section v, equation (5.9), and adopt the
following ansatz for m inside the kernels:

m(q) = m0ep2/2

.

(6.12)

we adopt also the solution

z(q) = (cid:16) q
(cid:17)

for the wavefunction renormalization factors which appear above. unfortunately the inte-
grations cannot be performed analytically if the exponential factor in (6.12) is present in
the denominators. hence in the denominators we set m to a constant, m, and it is with this

16

in mind that the scale m will be interpreted as an average mass over the range p  [0, ];
we will see that in the limits we wish to consider, dependence on the introduced scale drops
out. we can then perform the integrations analytically with result:

where the dots represent the omission of terms smaller than the nite terms exhibited above.
it is clear then, that to leading order in 1/n, the ansatz (6.12) is stable to iteration, and
we have found that the solution of the dierential equation in section v is consistent with
the full vertex and the restoration of the mass in the denominators of the kernels. we have
therefore demonstrated the possibility of a nite dynamically generated mass for this theory,
though we still nd no evidence for a critical avour number: we return to a discussion of
this issue in section ix.

c. concluding remarks.

in this section we have presented a computation of the wavefunction renormalization
and self energy with a three-point vertex which is consistent with the u(1) ward identity.
while we have not been able to use the elegant methods of section v, we have been able to
perform a direct computation, and within the approximations made we have found that the

17

wavefunction renormalization exhibits the expected critical behaviour [1618] and we have
exhibited a nite solution to the gap equation for the mass function:

z(p)  (cid:16) p
(cid:17)

,

 = 2

(1+)
n2 ;

m(p) = m0ep2/2

.

(6.15)

these results are qualitatively the same as those derived using the simple approximations of
section v, justifying the use of those approximations in determining qualitatively the gauge
dependence in this model.

since we have found that a mass can be dynamically generated in this model without
breaking supersymmetry, it is natural to ask whether it is possible to determine whether the
massive or massless (for m0 could still vanish) solution is favoured. in nonsupersymmetric
theories this question can be addressed by appealing to the eective potential (which upon
using a suitable variational principle leads to the same nonperturbative physics for qed3
as do the dysonschwinger equations [24]), but in supersymmetric models this potential
vanishes. based on experience with supersymmetric nonlinear sigma models [19] it was
conjectured [1] that the question could be settled by appealing to the eective action, and
to the ward identities arising from the supersymmetry. the same approach was taken
in reference [21] for a (2 + 1 dimensional) supersymmetric model with a cp1 constraint.
the simplest ward identity arising from supersymmetry relates the twopoint correlation
functions of the physical degrees of freedom in the matter supereld (in the presence of a
mass m for the multiplet):

h(x)(y)i0 = ( + m c)h(x)(y)i0.

(6.16)

crucially, in the models of references [1921], where there are further similar ward identities
relating correlation functions of elds arising from the implementation of the constraints,
it was found that these ward identities were only satised when the mass for the matter
multiplet was nonvanishing. in the present model, and in the n = 2 model of reference [1],
there are no such constraints, and so the ward identities place no further requirements on
the generated mass; of course, the supereld formalism we have adopted means that the
ward identity (6.16) is satised automatically. this leaves open the question of whether the
vacuum selects the massless or massive solution in supersymmetric u(1) gauge eld theory.

vii. extended supersymmetric action.

the n = 2 extended rigid superspace is constructed in a way slightly dierent to the
n = 1 model: it can be obtained by dimensional reduction from n = 1 supersymmetry in
four dimensions. the compactication is realised by considering all the elds in the model
to be independent of one spatial dimension and then integrating out this variable. the
rigid superspace of four dimensional n = 1 supersymmetry is parameterized by the usual
four spacetime coordinates and four grassmannodd coordinates arranged in two spinors
 and  , where   {1, 2} and   { 1, 2} [25], which we again denote collectively by z.

18

this furnishes the superspace with two spinorial derivatives d and d , covariant under
supersymmetry transformations, which leads to a crucial dierence compared to the three
dimensional model, in that the matter superelds now come in two types: chiral () and
antichiral (), which respectively obey the constraints

d  = 0,

d = 0.

(7.1)

we collect some basic results for four dimensional superspace in appendix b. consider chiral
and antichiral superelds which transform under local u(1) transformations in the following
way:

(z)  

(z)  

(z)= eie(z)(z),
(z)eie (z).
(z)= 

(7.2)

the functions  and  must respectively be chiral and antichiral, to preserve the chiral and
antichiral nature of the matter superelds. note that e is a dimensionless gauge coupling:
the dimensionful parameter which will again lead to a dynamically generated scale will be
the size of the compactied dimension. the gauge eld is now a real scalar supereld, and
transforms under innitesimal u(1) transformations in the following way

v (z) = v (z)  v (z) = v (z) +

i

2 (cid:0)  (cid:1) .

(7.3)

we now wish to consider a model with n = 1 supersymmetry, local u(1) gauge invariance
and n matter avours; again the action functional comprises three parts, a locally u(1)
invariant kinetic term for the matter superelds, a gauge invariant classical eld strength
for the gauge supereld, a (lorentz) gauge xing term; for convenience we will also add a
bare mass term for the matter superelds:

(7.4)

(7.5)

again we have included an implicit sum over n avours in the matter parts. there are a
number of important dierences between this action and the one we considered in the rst
part of this paper. first, there are now twice as many matter superelds: an antichiral
and chiral supereld for each charge under u(1): as we shall see this changes considerably
the structure of the propagators; in particular, note that in the absence of a bare mass
0 the noninteracting correlation function h+i0 vanishes, and the dysonschwinger

19

equations for the self energy and wavefunction renormalization are decoupled to an extent.
furthermore, it is evident that the implementation of the interaction with the gauge eld is
completely dierent: there are now an innite number of vertices with increasing numbers of
gauge superelds. in the wesszumino gauge (which projects out the physical components
of the gauge supereld, but which thereby breaks supersymmetry explicitly) the sequence
of interaction vertices terminates at the four point vertex, giving it the same content as the
model considered in the rst part of this paper. in order to make the model tractable, we
will truncate the dysonschwinger equations at the level of the fourpoint vertex, eectively
setting higherpoint vertices to zero [8]. this situation is certainly not ideal [9], but we
nd that the graph in the dysonschwinger equation arising from the fourpoint vertex
contributes trivially to the wavefunction renormalization, and we therefore believe that this
truncation will not aect the infra red physics. the dressed propagators for the model are
as follows:

+(p; 12) =



(p; 12) =

i(p)

z 2(p) p2 + 2(p)

iz(p)

d2
4
d2 d2

4(12),

z 2(p) p2 + 2(p)

16

4(12),

(7.6)

we have again used an abbreviated superspace notation where, for example
4(12)  4(1  2) = 2(1  2) 2(1  2)  2(12) 2(12).

the undressed gauge supereld propagator reads [25]

v v (p; 12) =

1

2p2 e16p 226p 1 (cid:26) 4

p2 (1  )  (1 + ) 4(12)(cid:27) ;

(7.7)

later we will dress this propagator with a vacuum polarization factor as before.

for simplicity we will restrict our attention to the simple vertex approximation considered
in the approach of section v; this is in fact consistent with the u(1) ward identity for this
model [8], at least in the limit of vanishing transferred momentum p.

viii. the dysonschwinger equations.

we can rewrite the matter superelds in terms of unconstrained scalar superelds, which

makes the evaluation of the superspace parts of the dysonschwinger equations simpler:

(p, , ) = e6p (p, ),
(p, , ) = e6p 
(p, ).


(8.1)

the dysonschwinger equations for the current model are shown schematically in gures
2 and 3. the graphs on the left hand side are a convenient abbreviation for the dierence
between the inverse full propagator and inverse bare propagator.

to study the infra red physics of n = 2 supersymmetric u(1) gauge eld theory in three
dimensions, we will simply consider all the elds above to be independent of one coordinate,
and then integrate it out: this will introduce a natural scale , the size of the compactied
dimension, and we will then be able to compare directly with the model of the rst part of
this paper. we compactify one dimension as follows:

z dq3 =

(8.10)

we can now incorporate the eects of massless matter loops into the gauge eld propagator,
by dressing it with the appropriate vacuum polarization factor:

where the limit   0+ is implied. again, outside the supersymmetric feynman gauge,
there are many infra red divergences which result from the propagation of a gauge artifact
in the gauge supereld. however, ignoring these divergences as spurious, we can see that
the solution above is consistent with the expected critical behaviour, with an exponent of
order o(1/n):

(8.16)

while it is not obvious that this form for the wavefunction renormalization is completely
reliable, what is clear is that there is no evidence for an overall factor of (1 ) in the
wavefunction renormalization, a fact which will be crucial for the discussion of the self
energy which follows.

b. self energy.

it was argued in reference [8] that the overall factor of (1) in the rst of equations (8.13)
and its four dimensional ancestor (8.8) for the self energy means that the self energy vanishes

24

in feynman gauge, and since the full gauge dependence was carried through, this indicates
that the self energy vanishes in all gauges; this was conjectured to be the result of a four
dimensional (nonperturbative) nonrenormalization theorem [8]. this argument has been
criticized [9,10] on the grounds that the self energy function is not a gauge invariant function,
and nor are the functions appearing in the kernel; in particular, the gauge dependence of
the functions appearing in the kernel could in principle conspire to cancel the overall factor
of (1) and leave a gauge independent integral equation, which could have nite solutions.
to answer this question it is convenient to divide the integral equation for  through by
z(p) to obtain

m(p) =



n3 (1)z dq

1

z(p)

m(q)

q2 + m 2(q) (cid:20) 2q2p

p2  q2 (p  q) +

2p2q

q2  p2 (q  p)(cid:21) .

(8.17)

in the limit p  0 the function m(p) is gauge invariant; since we have shown that there
can be no factor of (1) from the wavefunction renormalization factor in (8.17), it seems
that the function m(p), even if the result of integrating the kernel were nite, would retain
the overall factor of (1), and therefore the only self consistent solution would be that the
mass vanished. we have not probed the structure of the vertex g3 coming from the u(1)
ward identity [8], but this will only relate g3 to combinations of  and z: it will not lead
to the gauge dependence required to cancel the overall factor of (1). in order to make
this argument, we depend on the approximate form of the wavefunction renormalization
(8.16), and hence on the scale ; therefore our argument does not extend back to the four
dimensional model where the scale  is absent, and the coupling remains dimensionless.

a related point of interest is that, contrasting the n = 1 case, there is no part of the
integral equation for m(p) which is not troubled by the infra red divergences generated by
the gauge artifact; these divergences are known to disappear in supersymmetric feynman
gauge. the structure of the divergent terms make it impossible to construct an equivalent
dierential equation from the integral equation above.

c. concluding remarks.

in this part of the paper we have attempted to probe carefully the gauge dependence
of the n = 2 model. we have chosen a simplied threevertex and we have truncated
the innite series of higherpoint vertices at four. within these approximations, we have
been able to compute the wavefunction renormalization, and have shown that although the
computation is plagued with (expected) infra red divergences, we nd no evidence for the
overall gauge dependence which would be necessary to cancel the factor of (1) in equation
(8.17) and evade the gauge dependence argument of reference [8]. we have followed this
argument through for the (compactied) three dimensional model, where the scale  is
available;
in particular, the renormalization group resummed form for the wavefunction
renormalization requires the existence of the scale . while the properties of the four
dimensional model are communicated to the three dimensional extended model through the
compactication, it is not clear that the results presented here are applicable also for the
four dimensional model where the scale  is necessarily absent; whence the arguments of
references [9,10] on evading the nonrenormalization theorem in the four dimensional model

25

could still hold. our results here are in agreement with a numerical evaluation of the eective
potential for the three dimensional model in component formalism [11].

ix. discussion and conclusion.

a. the n = 1 model.

the supereld formalism we have adopted has the advantage of keeping supersymmetry
manifest; this has allowed us to concentrate on two aspects of the infra red physics which have
troubled components computations in both the supersymmetric and nonsupersymmetric
versions of this model, namely gauge invariance and the full vertex. in particular, the super-
eld formalism gave us extra power to deal with the u(1) ward identity for the full vertex.
the disadvantages of the supereld approach are apparent in the spurious singular terms
which appear as a result of propagating extra degrees of freedom in the gauge supereld.
this problem can be avoided in supersymmetric feynman gauge, and it is this which means
we have had to give separate treatments to probe the gauge dependence and the issue of the
full vertex.

the rst treatment employed some of the simplest approximations: a near trivial vertex
(which satises the u(1) ward identity only in the limit of vanishing transferred momen-
tum, but which allows for a nontrivial wavefunction renormalization) and neglecting the
mass in the denominators of the kernels. this programme of approximations is drastic,
but computationally extremely convenient: enough to allow us to probe the gauge depen-
dence of the mass function. this vertex choice and the bifurcation method have been used
with some success in the study of nonsupersymmetric qed3, and is sucient to demon-
strate the existence of a dynamically generated mass [3] (at least in landau gauge). in the
model studied here, the method returns the expected critical behaviour in the wavefunction
renormalization, and exhibits a gauge independent solution for the dynamically generated
mass. the critical behaviour we nd contrasts the trivial wavefunction renormalization of
reference [12], and is qualitatively the same as that of nonsupersymmetric qed3, where
mass is also dynamically generated. our second treatment employs the biggest advantage of
the supereld formalism, that of making the u(1) ward identity tractable. unfortunately,
the problem of infra red divergences in the superspace approach restrict us to working in
supersymmetric feynman gauge for this computation. however, we nd again the expected
critical behaviour in the wavefunction renormalization and again exhibit the possibility of a
nite dynamically generated mass; in particular, we nd that the solution obtained in the
rst simplied approach is consistent with the full vertex, and a nonvanishing mass func-
tion in the denominators. it is possible to criticize the approaches taken in both treatments
we have presented, but since they tackle dierent issues with the same result, we argue
that taken together they provide strong evidence for nontrivial infra red physics in n = 1
supersymmetric u(1) gauge theory.
the question of whether or not the nite mass solution is actually selected has been
addressed: contrary to the suggestion in reference [1] and the situations in the constrained
models of references [1921], we nd that no extra information can be obtained by appeal-
ing to the supersymmetry ward identities. unfortunately this leaves us with no way to

26

determine whether the nite mass solution is actually selected by the vacuum of this theory.
we have found no evidence in this model for a critical avour number, above which
no mass generation occurs. this is in contrast to the nonsupersymmetric case [2, 4]. as
has been noted already, the dierential equation (5.8) has nite solutions when the mass
function is gauge invariant for all p (in the range permitted by our approximations: the infra
red), but no solutions which are gauge invariant only in the limit of vanishing p and gauge
dependent elsewhere. this is to be contrasted with the nonsupersymmetric case, where
solutions of the latter type do appear to exist. the integral equation for the mass function
in that case (in general gauge, and with the simplied vertex choice of g3 = z(q)) is as
follows:

m(p) =

8

2n (cid:20)z p

0

dq (cid:18)1

p

+



2p2(cid:19) q2m(q)

q2 + m 2(q)

+z 

p

dq (cid:18)q +



2 (cid:19) m(q)

q2 + m 2(q)(cid:21) .

(9.1)

the conventional method for the nonsupersymmetric case is to consider landau gauge
( = 0) and construct an equivalent dierential equation [4]:



p (cid:18)p2 m

p (cid:19) = 

8

2n

p2 m
p2 + m 2 ;

(9.2)

the solution of this dierential equation takes the form of a hypergeometric function; crucially
this leads to a constraint on n such that above a certain critical avour number, no mass
generation occurs [4]. proceeding as we have done for the supersymmetric model, one has to
make three dierentiations with respect to p to remove the integrations, and the linearized
(neglecting the mass in the denominators) result is as follows (in dimensionless variables
rescaled by ):

p3 m + 6p2 m +(cid:20)6p +

8

n2 (p + )(cid:21) m +

16
n2 m +

8
n2 m = 0.

(9.3)

demanding as before that m = 0 for all p, we nd a constant solution for m; substituting a
gauge dependent power series indicates that there is also the possibility of gauge independent
constant as p  0 but with a gauge dependent function of p away from this limit. this
latter type of solution does not exist in the supersymmetric model. we see then that the
gauge dependence of the two models is rather subtly dierent, and the fact that we nd
no critical avour number may be related to this. in support of this view it is instructive
to attempt to construct a dierential equation similar to equation (9.2) for the n = 1
supersymmetric model, which might then show some evidence for a critical avour number.
to this end we return to the second of integral equations (5.3) for the self energy, and
again perform dierentiations with respect to p, but retaining the mass as a constant in the
denominators [4]:



p (cid:18)p2 m(p)

p (cid:19) =

2(14)
n2

p2 m(p)
p2 + m 2 .

(9.4)

by analogy with the analysis of reference [4] the critical avour number derived from the
equation above would be

27

nc =

8(14)

2

,

which on account of its explicit gauge dependence has no physical meaning.

an interesting comparison can be made with the model of reference [26], where dynam-
ical mass generation in an navour eective theory of fermions in three dimensions is
studied using the renormalization group and the  expansion. the eective theory has for
its degrees of freedom explicitly gauge independent (composite operator) elds, and so the
treatment is necessarily gauge independent; in this approach also there is no critical avour
number. we also found no critical avour number when we included the eects of the full
vertex (and the nontrivial wavefunction renormalization): this is reminiscent of results in
nonsupersymmetric qed3 [27] where it has been argued that the critical avour number of
reference [2] was an artifact of including only a trivial wavefunction renormalization and sim-
plied vertex. in both our simple computation and the full computation, we have included
the eects of nontrivial wavefunction renormalization.

b. the n = 2 model.

in contrast to the n = 1 model, in extended supersymmetric electrodynamics, we nd
strong evidence for the nonexistence of a dynamically generated mass, based on a rene-
ment of the gauge dependence argument of reference [8]. we have used the same trunca-
tion in the dysonschwinger equations (in keeping only three and fourpoint vertices) as
used in the four dimensional model. this truncation is consistent with restriction to the
wesszumino gauge, which respects neither supersymmetry nor gauge invariance. within
this approximation we have chosen a simplied vertex (but one which is consistent with
a nontrivial wavefunction renormalization) and we have then computed the wavefunction
renormalization. we found no evidence for the appearance of an overall factor of (1 )
which, if present, could have evaded [9, 10] the gauge dependence argument of reference [8].
instead we found that the wavefunction seems to have the same sort of critical behaviour as
in the nonsupersymmetric and n = 1 cases, though this is by no means certain on account
of the presence of infra red divergences (again from an artifact in the gauge supereld). our
result here is in line with reference [11], in which a numerical study showed that a mass
is not dynamically generated in the n = 2 model. while we have been able to show that
there is strong evidence against the dynamical generation of mass in the three dimensional
extended supersymmetric model, our results depend crucially on the existence of the scale 
(arising from the size of the compactied dimension). in the four dimensional model, where
this scale is absent, the arguments of [9, 10] could still hold, and the nonrenormalization
theorem of reference [8] be evaded.

the vertex corresponding to a factor of i(2e)n (or i(2e)n for the elds  and 
, which
are negatively charged under u(1)). in wesszumino gauge, the series terminates at n = 2,
and we dress the corresponding vertices with the functions g3 and g4.
