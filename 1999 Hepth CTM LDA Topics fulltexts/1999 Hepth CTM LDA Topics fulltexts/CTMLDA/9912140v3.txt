the thermodynamics of gauge theories on the noncommutative plane is studied in per-

turbation theory. for u (1) noncommutative yang-mills we compute the rst quantum

correction to the ideal gas free energy density and study their behavior in the low and high

temperature regimes. since the noncommutativity scale eectively cuto interactions at

large distances, the theory is regular in the infrared. in the case of u (n ) noncommutative

yang-mills we evaluate the two-loop free energy density and nd that it depends on the

noncommutativity parameter through the contribution of non-planar diagrams.

1. introduction

noncommutative geometry [1] has been a recurrent issue in physics in the last decades.

after several attempts to incorporate the mathematical formalism in string eld theory

[2] and even the standard model [3][4] and the quantum hall eect [5], it has recently

re-emerged in the context of string/m-theory in the presence of constant background elds

[6][7][8]. since the low-energy limit of these congurations is described in terms of a

supersymmetric gauge theory living in a noncommutative space, the study of these type

of nonlocal eld theories has received renewed attention lately. now, however, because of

their stringy connections, new tools are available to study the physics of noncommutative

eld theories. as a matter of example, the extension of the ads/cft correspondence
to backgrounds with constant vacuum values of the (neveu-schwarz)2 tensor eld [9][10]

makes it feasible the study of noncommutative eld theories also in the strong coupling

regime [11][12][13][14][15]. on the perturbative side, several aspects of noncommutative

gauge theories have been recently addressed in [16][17][18].

the physical idea behind the application of noncommutative geometry is that of the

quantization of space-time itself by introducing noncommuting space-time coordinates

[x, x] = 2i ,

,  = 0, . . . , d  1.

(1.1)

roughly speaking, in ordinary quantum theory the canonical commutation relations lead

to a quantization of the phase space that results in a smeared symplectic geometry at

short distances due to the uncertainty principle. following a similar line of reasoning, one

is lead to think that the commutation relations (1.1) will smear the space-time picture at
distances shorter than , imposing thus a natural cuto for the description of nature in
terms of a local quantum eld theory.

in the formalism on noncommutative geometry, the geometrical features of the non-
commutative manifold are reconstructed by considering the deformation of the c-algebra
of continuous complex functions dened on it and vanishing at innity, using the weyl

product

(f  g)(x) = f (x)ei

iij





 j g(x).

(1.2)

consequently, quantum eld theories on noncommutative spaces can be formulated by

writing the ordinary action and replacing the commutative product with the -product

dened by (1.2); because of its non-polynomial character, the resulting eld theories will

1

be non-local.

it is actually this non-locality what is argued to smear physics at short

distances.

the study of systems at nite temperature usually provides good insights into their

physical behavior. in this note we will be concerned with the thermodynamics of yang-
mills theories on noncommutative spaces (ncym) of the type m  rt where m is some
(d1)-dimensional noncommutative space, typically rd1
, characterized by a deformation
matrix ij (i, j = 1, . . . , d 1, d > 2). in this setup, we can compute the thermodynamical
potentials using the imaginary time formalism by compactifying the euclidean time to



length  = t 1. the corresponding feynman rules are thus obtained from the euclidean

feynman rules of zero temperature noncommutative gauge theories by quantizing the

time components of the momenta in units of 2t . one technical payo of restricting

noncommutativity to the spatial sections is that the resulting non-polynomial functions of

the momenta in the feynman integrals do not involve the discrete euclidean momentum.

thus, the matsubara sums that appear in the computation of the free energy are of the

same kind that one encounters in ordinary commutative quantum eld theories.

in the following we will focus our attention on gauge theories on r2

rt.
actually, in the four-dimensional case we can always nd a rigid orthogonal coordinate

rt and r3

transformation x = ax that takes a generic antisymmetric matrix ij to its block o-

diagonal form

23. thus, when expressed in the appropriate system of coordinates,

we see that r3

  rt is actually equivalent to r2

  r  rt.

the present paper is organized as follows: in sec. 2 we study the loop corrections to

the thermodynamics of u (1) pure ncym theories at nite temperature. sec. 3 will be

devoted to the study of the non-abelian u (n ) case (and its supersymmetric extensions),

where we will nd that all the dependence of the two-loop free energy density on  comes

from the contribution of the u (1) part of u (n ) to non-planar diagrams. finally, in sec.

4 we will summarize our conclusions.

2. thermodynamics of u (1) ncym

noncommutative pure u (1) yang-mills theory is specially interesting, since in this

case interaction appears solely as the result of noncommutativity. the action of a u (1)
gauge eld on rd1

  rt can be written as
1

su(1) = 

4 z ddx f  f 

(2.1)

where the star product is dened by (1.2) and the eld strength is given in terms of the
moyal bracket {f, g}mb = f  g  g  f as

f = a  a + ig{a, a}mb.

the feynman rules for this theory are easily written in momentum space, as shown

in references [19][20]. the resulting diagrammatic expansion is qualitatively similar to

ordinary non-abelian yang-mills theories, except for the momentum dependence of the
vertices through the function sin(ijpiqj). as we will see later, this extra dependence on
the momenta with respect to the ordinary non-abelian yang-mills theory has important

consequences on the infrared behavior of the noncommutative theory.

at one-loop level, the free energy density is determined by the quadratic part of the

action and as a consequence it is independent of the noncommutativity of the base space.

thus, the result is identical of that of pure qedd, namely

f (t )1loop = (d  2)

(d/2)

 d

(d)t d.

(2.2)

corrections to the ideal gas contributions can be computed in perturbation theory

using the feynman rules given in ref.

[20] (see also [21]). the rst term correcting eq.

(2.2) comes from two-loop diagrams. in our case, the nal result can be cast in the form

f (t )2loop = g2(d  2)2z

(2.3)

where p = p, (p, q) = ijpiqj and

nb(p) =

3

is the bose-einstein distribution function. ultraviolet divergences in the zero temperature

part of the diagrams are taken care of by inserting the corresponding one-loop couterterms

at t = 0 [20][22].

a rst thing to be noticed is that, in spite of the similarities between the diagrammatic

expansion of the free energy of noncommutative u (1) gauge theory and that of pure ymd,
here the infrared behavior is much softer due to the presence of the factor sin2 (p, q).
which when p  0 will vanish as o(p2). thus, the two-loop correction (2.3) is well dened
for all d  3.

let us rst analyze the three dimensional case (d = 3). here, the antisymmetric

matrix ij can be written as ij = ij and the integration over angular variables in (2.3)

can be easily performed with the result

f (t )2loop =

g2t 2

82 z

duz

dv

1  j0(2t 2uv)
(eu  1)(ev  1)

.

(2.4)

we notice that this integral is both infrared (u, v  0) and ultraviolet (u, v  ) conver-
gent. let us study rst the case when the temperature is much smaller than the energy
associated with noncommutativity eects. if t  1, we can expand the bessel
scale 1
function in power series and integrate term by term. the result is an asymptotic series
valid for small t whose rst term is

f (t )2loop 

(3)2
22 g22t 6 + . . .

the asymptotic character of the series is easily understood by realizing that by expanding

the bessel function in power series and truncating the series we fall short in reproducing

the integrand in the ultraviolet region, but this is precisely the region of the integral that

is eectively cuto at low temperatures.

the evaluation of (2.4) in the opposite region t  1/ is more complicated due

to the peculiar infrared structure of the theory at hand. we know that, asymptotically,

the bessel function oscillates very fast for large values of the argument. if we introduce a
cuto  (that in principle will depend on the value of t) to isolate the infrared sector
of the integral, we have that

since for large values of the argument the rapidly oscillating bessel function will be averaged

to zero. thus, when t  1 we can write

f (t )2loop 

1

3f (t, )su(2)

2loop + f (t, )ir

(2.5)

where f (t, )su(2)
2loop is the two-loop free energy density of ordinary pure ym3 with gauge
group su (2) and infrared momentum cuto t , and f (t, )ir is some contribution

containing the information from the infrared sector of the theory.

we can interpret the decomposition (2.5) in the sense that, in the large-t limit, the
ultraviolet sector of the u (1) noncommutative gauge theory is well described in terms of
an ordinary yang-mills theory with c2(g) = 2 [22][19][20]. the numerical prefactor 1
3 just
reects the fact that the u (1) noncommutative gauge theory only has one propagating

photon while the su (2) yang-mills theory has three propagating gluons. thus, the

contribution to the free energy from the ultraviolet part of the theory is given by the free

energy per vector boson of an su (2) commutative gauge theory. on the other hand, we

see that the theory in the infrared is radically dierent from ordinary yang-mills which is

infrared divergent at two loops in three dimensions. this feature is very much reminiscent

of the morita equivalence [23] between u (1) yang-mills theory on the noncommutative

torus and a u (n ) gauge theory on a commutative one in the presence of a magnetic ux,

where the infrared sector of the theory is regularized by the presence of the background

twisted gauge eld [24][25].

let us focus our attention now on the four-dimensional case. from the discussion in the

introduction, we know that we can choose coordinates x, y, z such that noncommutativity

is restricted to the xy-plane, [x, y] = 2i, [x, z] = [y, z] = 0. since the interacting character

of the theory is entirely due to the noncommutativity of the base space, we nd that

our theory will be free whenever the momenta are orthogonal to the xy-plane. thus, in

order to study the integral (2.4) it is convenient to use cylindrical coordinates where the

z-coordinate coincides with the central direction. again we can integrate over angular

variables to nd

(2.6)

as in three dimensions, when t is small we can expand the bessel function to get an
asymptotic series in powers of t,

45(cid:19)2
f (t )2loop  2g2(cid:18) 2

2t 8 + . . .

when t  1 it is dicult to estimate the value of the integral (2.6). since the function

resulting from integration of the angular variables is the same than in the three-dimensional

case, we can argue along similar lines that, again, the free energy can be decomposed as in

(2.5) into a su (2)-like ordinary yang-mills piece and a contribution that takes care of the

infrared sector of the theory. although ordinary yang-mills in four-dimensions is infrared

nite at two loops and each term in (2.5) is nite in the limit   0 (when t  ),

the infrared part f (t, )ir gives always a non-trivial contribution, even in this limit.
this is due to the fact that in the infrared region the function multiplying j0(2t 2uv)
in the integrand is unbounded and rapidly varying close to u, v = 0. thus, when t is
very large the highly oscillatory bessel function is not able to average it to zero since the

function multiplying it is not approximately constant in a single period.

in principle, one could compute higher order corrections to the thermodynamic poten-

tial (2.6). in ordinary ym4 at nite temperature the self-interaction of gluons introduce
infrared divergences at three loops that do not cancel order by order in perturbation theory

and have to be taken care of by resumming the so-called ring diagrams. the result is a
mild breakdown of the perturbative expansion that now is no longer a series in g2 alone
but also contains terms of order g3 [26], g4 log g2 [27] and g5 [28][29](for similar results in
qed see [30]). the situation is worsened by extra divergences due to the self-interaction
of the transverse gluons that invalidates perturbation theory at o(g6).
we can study what happens with u (1) yang-mills theory on r2

  r  rt for higher
loops contributions to the free energy. a rst problem to be solved would be whether

the noncommutative u (1) theory itself is renormalizable at t = 0 beyond one loop. let

us however assume that the ultraviolet divergences in the zero temperature sector can be

handled by some cuto and concentrate our attention on the (ultraviolet nite) tempera-

ture dependent contributions. at three loops, infrared divergences are associated with the

existence of a non-vanishing thermal mass at one loop. in the case at hand, however, if we

compute the static limit of the one-loop self-energy of the gluon we nd that it vanishes

quadratically with the external spatial momentum,

00(q0 = 0, ~q  0) = 2 

 (q0 = 0, ~q  0) 

162
45

g22t 4q2

where qxy is the modulus of the projection of the external momentum ~q on the xy-plane.
the rst consequence of this fact, is that three-loop diagrams are free of infrared diver-
gences and therefore the next correction to the free energy is of order g4.

the soft behavior of u (1) ncym at low momenta (or large distances) follows from

the fact that in this limit the theory becomes free. in physical terms, this is because the

theory should reduce itself to its commutative version (a free u (1) pure gauge theory) at
length scales much bigger than the typical scale of noncommutative eects, i.e. . in
this sense, this scale plays the role of an infrared cuto for the noncommutativity-induced

interactions, which in the ultraviolet resemble those of a non-abelian gauge theory. thus,
the absence of infrared divergences and non-analytic terms in g2 in the lowest orders in
perturbation theory seems to be a generic feature of the whole perturbative expansion
which would be a series in integer powers of g2.

before closing this section, let us make some remarks about the possible supersym-

metric extensions of u (1) ncym. in the commutative case, we can construct a trivial

supersymmetric theory by adding to the pure ym4 theory the action of a free massless
majorana or weyl spinor. this theory can be deformed into an interacting supersymmetric
theory by switching on the noncommutativity of the base space3

(2.7)

where the covariant derivative is dened by d =   i(a      a). to compute
the two-loop free energy density now we have to add to the result for pure ncym the

contribution coming from the fermion loop with the result

(2.8)
with nf (p) = 1/(ep/t + 1) the fermi-dirac distribution function. the structure of ex-
pression (2.8) is similar to the two-loop free energy of ordinary sym [31]. here again

the theory at low momenta becomes trivial (a free gauge eld plus an adjoint u (1)
fermion), rendering the theory infrared nite, while in the ultraviolet it resembles n = 1
sym4 with c2(g) = 2. the three-dimensional case can be worked out along similar lines,
starting with the action (2.7) in three dimensions (with  a majorana spinor). as in the

non-supersymmetric case, the result is infrared nite.

3 extended supersymmetric theories can be obtained by considering a similar action in dimen-

sion six or ten and performing dimensional reduction to four dimensions.

7

3. non-abelian ncym

let us consider now non-abelian four-dimensional noncommutative gauge theories on
r2
  r rt. the non-abelian generalization of the action (2.1) is easily written as (group
generators are normalized according to tr t at b = 1

2 ab)
2 z d4x tr [f  f  ]

1

s = 

(3.1)

where f = a   a  ig(a  a  a  a). now since our elds are matrix-valued
functions, the -product is dened by tensoring the weyl product (1.2) with the ordinary

product of matrices. a rst consequence of this is that in order for the gauge elds to form

a closed algebra we should restrict the gauge group to u (n ) [8], since we have to demand
the group generators to form a closed algebra under ordinary matrix multiplication4. from

a purely quantum eld theoretical point of view, one can try to construct noncommutative

gauge theories using moyal brackets with gauge groups dierent from u (n ). at this level

the obstruction to consider these other groups arises in the form of inconsistencies of the

resulting non-local quantum eld theory. for su (n ), for example, the gauge variation of
the vector eld a, a =  + i(  a  a  ), gets an extra piece proportional to
the identity matrix

a =

i
2n

(a  aa

  aa

  a)1 + . . .

where the -product on the right hand side corresponds to that of ordinary functions. thus,

ordinary gauge transformations do not keep the vector eld in the adjoint representation of
su (n ). notice, however, that this extra piece scales as o(1/n ) and therefore disappears
when n   where the theory reduces itself to u (n ) in the large-n limit, as well as in
the commutative limit when we recover ordinary su (n ) ym.

in the ideal gas approximation, the free energy is easily computed by adding the

contribution of the dierent degrees of freedom. since the noncommutativity parameter 

4 from the point of view of string theory, one can in principle allow for other groups such as
so(n ) and u sp(2n ) by introducing orientifold planes. naively, the introduction of orientifolds
will project out the (neveu-schwarz)2 antisymmetric tensor eld, and so it looks like one can only

obtain commutative space-times. however, the orientation projection is compatible with having
quantized background values of the (neveu-schwarz)2 eld [32] that will lead to a deformed
product of functions on the manifold. this deformed product, however, is not necessarily non-

commutative. we thank j. de boer for a discussion on this point.

yang-mills theory

f (t )1loop = dim g

t 4

(3.2)

where dim g is the dimension of the gauge group, n 2 for u (n ).

in order to compute loop corrections to the free gas approximation, we need the

feynman rules for the non-abelian noncommutative yang-mills theory. now, in contrast
with the u (1) case, there are interactions surviving the commutative   0 limit, so the
structure of the vertices will be more involved. in order to make the computation more

transparent, instead of using the trigonometric basis for the gauge group generators [33],
we will write feynman rules using the structure constants f abc and gell-mann tensor dabc
of the gauge group, dened in terms of the generators t a by the identities

f abc = 2i tr [t a, t b]t c
dabc = 2 tr{t a, t b}t c

where by {, } we represent the anticommutator of the two generators.

the feynman rules for the noncommutative u (n ) yang-mills can be easily obtained

by writing the action (3.1) in momentum space. it turns out that the only change with

respect to the feynman rules of u (n ) ordinary yang-mills is the replacement on each

vertex of the structure constants according to

f a1a2a3  f a1a2a3 cos (p1, p2) + da1a2a3 sin (p1, p2)

(3.3)

where ai is the color index associated with the particle with (incoming) momentum pi.

with this only change, the rst quantum correction to (3.2) can be computed to give

however, for u (n ) (n > 1) it turns out to be that5

f abcf abc = n (n 2  1),

dabcdabc = n (n 2 + 1)

5 for n = 1 we recover the results of the previous section by setting f aaa = 0 and daaa = 2.

the rst (-independent) part of f (t, )2loop is just the result for the two-loop free energy
of ordinary pure su (n ) yang-mills theories in four dimensions [26]. on the other hand,

the -dependence in the free energy density is subleading in the large-n limit and comes

from the contribution of the u (1) part of u (n ) to the two-loop non-planar diagrams.
incidentally, in the large-t limit the contribution of the u (1) part of u (n ) in the
ultraviolet combines with contribution of the su (n ) part in the same region in such a
way that the nal result is of order o(n 2) for nite n . this is a further evidence of the
planar character of noncommutative yang-mills in the large- regime at xed temperature

(or at large temperatures and xed ) [34][12][15][16].

in evaluating the free energy density at three loops, we are faced with the customary

infrared divergences coming from the commutative su (n ) part, since the u (1) part

decouples at large distances (p  1/) and will not induce infrared divergences. as

usual, these infrared singularities can be handled by resumming su (n ) propagators in

loops. since the infrared structure of the theory is similar to commutative su (n ) yang-
mills, thermal perturbation theory is expected to break down at order o[(g2n )3]. as in
the previous section, for small t we can obtain an asymptotic expansion in powers of
t. in the opposite limit we nd that the u (1) gauge boson eectively interacts like a
non-abelian yang-mills eld in the ultraviolet.

this result extends to supersymmetric theories straightforwardly [35][19]. the la-

grangian of extended ncsym theories can be written using the trick of dimensional re-
duction proposed in [31]. we start with a dmax-dimensional maximal n = 1 theory on
m  rt  (s1)dmax4

described by

r

l = 

1
2

tr f  f  + itr a  da.

as in [31] we take the limit r  0 and retain only the zero modes of the elds in the internal
coordinates, which in loop computations amounts to restrict momenta to four-dimensions

in the feynman integrals. since all the internal coordinates are commutative, the matrix

10

ij is completely oblivious of the fact that we are performing dimensional reduction. thus,
we get n = 1, n = 2 and n = 4 ncsym4 by taking dmax = 4, 6, 10 respectively.

again, feynman rules for u (n ) ncsym are retrieved by the replacement (3.3) on the

rules for ordinary sym. repeating the analysis above, we nd again that all dependence

in  comes from the contribution from u (1) elds in non-planar diagrams, namely

4. conclusions

in the present paper we have studied several aspects of the thermodynamics of per-

turbative gauge theories on noncommutative spaces. the case of u (1) ncym is the most

interesting example from a dynamical point of view. we have computed the quantum cor-

rections to the one loop result and found that, due to the restoration of the free theory at

low momenta, the theory is free of infrared divergences at three loops, due to the fact that

the one loop two-point function of the gauge eld in the static limit vanishes quadratically

with the external momenta. although we did not explicitly compute corrections beyond
order o(g2), the general structure of the theory seems to indicate that there is no onset of
infrared divergences at any order.

for large values of t we have seen that the theory behaves in the ultraviolet as
an ordinary non-abelian yang-mills theory with c2(g) = 2. this is in perfect accordance
with the result of references [19][20][22], in the sense that the ultraviolet divergences of
the theory are obtained by averaging the factors sin2 (p, q) in the amplitudes. on the

other hand, the theory is completely dierent from an ordinary non-abelian gauge theory

in the infrared. this is due to the fact that at large distances noncommutativity eects

are negligible and a free theory is restored.

in the case of u (n ) ncym, we have found that the two-loop free energy density
only depends on  through terms of order o(1) in the large-n limit that correspond to

11

the contribution of the u (1) part of u (n ) in non-planar loop diagrams. since these u (1)

contributions are regular in the infrared, we nd that the infrared structure of the theory

is determined by the su (n ) part and thus it is identical to that of ordinary ym theories.

in particular, we will have infrared singularities at three loops that can be resummed to
give contributions of order o[(g2n )3/2] and o[(g2n )2 log g2n ], as well as o[(g2n )5/2].
thermal perturbation theory will break down at four loops due to the self-interaction of

magnetic su (n ) gluons.

here we have restricted ourselves to gauge theories on the noncommutative plane.

it would be interesting to better understand the case of u (1) yang-mills theories in the

noncommutative torus, specially in the case of rational . the computation of quantum

corrections in this case is straightforward, and essentially amounts to replacing in our
expressions momentum integrals by discrete sums and rescaling ij  ij. by using
morita equivalence, one should be able to relate the free energy of these theories with that

of ordinary gauge theories in the presence of twisted background elds.
