summary.  solutions of classical string theory, correspondent to the world sheets,
mapped in minkowsky space with a fold, are considered. typical processes for them
are creation of strings from vacuum, their recombination and annihilation. these
solutions violate positiveness of square of mass and regge condition. in quantum
string theory these solutions correspond to physical states |ddfi + |spi with non-
zero spurious component.

introduction

in this work we want to draw theoretists attention to the fact that classical mechanics
of nambu-goto string in its covariant hamiltonian formulation contains solutions with
quite exotic properties. particularly, it contains solutions with negative square of mass.
one can easily clarify this in the following example.

example 1. phase space of open string is described by innite set of canonical oscillator
variables an
and virasoro constraints ln =
ank

 = 0. let consider the following set of oscillators:

, restricted by reality condition (an

) = an

a0

 = (0, /2,/2i), others an

 = 0.

here we consider a theory in 3-dimensional minkowsky space, an
parameter.

2 );  is real

lets show, that given set satises virasoro constraints. at |n| > 4 ln = 0, because
in each term of the sump ak
one of oscillator variables vanishes. due to a property
ln = (ln), the check is needed only for conditions ln = 0 at 0  n  4. these
conditions have a form:

their validity can be easily proven by direct substitution of an
.

total momentum of the string is dened by an expression: p = a0

. thus, square

of strings mass p 2 = (1  2) is positive at || < 1 and negative at || > 1.
lets consider a function a() = 1/pn an
ein. in given example a0() = (1 +
2 cos )/, at || > 1/2 this function is not everywhere positive. solutions, for which

a0() has variable sign, will be further called exotic.
in this paper we will consider
the properties of such solutions. in section 1 we describe the geometrical method for
reconstruction of string dynamics and show several examples of exotic dynamics.
in
section 2 we consider the properties of exotic solutions in lagrangian theory. in section 3
the appearance of exotic solutions in quantum string theory is discussed.

1.  exotic solutions in hamiltonian theory

1.1. geometrical reconstruction of exotic solutions.

lets introduce a function, related with strings coordinates and momenta by expres-

sions [1]

(1)

(2)

q() = x() +z 
x() = (q() + q())/2,

d p(),

0

p() = (q() + q())/2

(x, p are even functions of ). in terms of oscillator variables, introduced earlier:

(3)

q() = x + p

  + 1 xn6=0

an
in ein, q() = a().


the curve, dened by the function q() (further called supporting curve) has the fol-
lowing properties:

 () = 0, this property is equivalent to virasoro constraints

1. the curve is light-like: q2
on oscillator variables;
2. the curve is periodical: q( + 2)  q() = const = 2p
of the string);
3. the curve coincides with the world line of one string end: x(0,  ) = q( ); the
world line of another end is the same curve, shifted onto the semi-period: x(,  ) =
q( +  )  p;
4. the whole world sheet is reconstructed by this curve as follows: x(,  ) = (q(1) +
q(2))/2, 1,2 =   , see g.1.
these properties can be easily proven from the denition of q() and known mechanics
in oscillator variables, see appendix 1.

(p is total momentum

further consideration will be restricted to the supporting curves, whose time com-
ponent q0() is non-monotonous function, see g.2. such curves can be explicitly con-
structed, specifying tangent vector in the form q() = a0()(1, ~n()), where ~n()2 = 1,
~n() is 2-periodic function, and a0() is 2-periodic function of variable sign(1). such

(1) substitution ~n() = (cos , sin ) and a0() = (1 + 2 cos )/ corresponds to oscillator
variables from example 1.

supporting curves necessarily have singularities (cusps)(2).

supporting curve, non-

vector p is time-like or light-like: p 2  0, because p = r 2

for the curves with a0() > 0 (correspondent solutions are further called normal)
0 da()/2 is represented
as a sum of light-like vectors, directed into the future. for non-monotonous supporting
curves p 2 might take the both signs. at rst, lets study the case of time-like p. in this
case we can consider the evolution in center-of-mass frame (cmf), where p is directed
along the time axis.

example 2. let each period of supporting curve contains a single non-monotonous inter-
val, whose sizes are small comparing with the period. e.g. q() = a0()(1, cos , sin )
with a0() = 1 + 1.4 cos 2 0.6 sin 3. for this choice p = (, 0, 0) is directed along the
time axis. the graph of function a0() and correspondent supporting curve are shown
on g.3.

simplied model of the world sheet, stretched onto such supporting curve, is shown on
g.4. equal-time slice of the world sheet at t < ta is a single connected curve (permanent
component), consisting of two segments l and a. at t = ta an additional open string
bc appears. at t = tr a process of recombination occurs, the strings exchange by their
segments: (la) + (bc)  (lb) + (ac). short string ac disappears at t = tb. further
evolution (till the end of a period) contains only permanent component lb.
realistic image of the world sheet (g.5) contains more details. particularly, one
can nd here singular lines (f rad and gbre). slices of the world sheet have cusps
along these lines. these two lines are congruent and homotetic to to the supporting
curve (cabh) with the coecient 1/2. they are created by cusp points a, b on the
supporting curve(3). general structure of equal-time slices is the same: creation of new
open string in point a, its recombination with the permanent component in point r,
and annihilation of new string in point b. equal-time slices of this surface are shown on
g.6.

(2) when q0() changes its sign, vector q(), lying on the light cone, passes through the
origin: q() = 0. in this point the supporting curve has a cusp.
(3) cusp on supporting curve in point q() creates a singularity on the world sheet, located
along the line (q() + q())/2, i.e. the supporting curve, contracted twice to the point q().

fig.7 shows equal-time slices x0(1, 2) = t on the plane of parameters (1, 2).
band 1  2  1 + 2 on this plane uniquely represents the world sheet. slice for
the moment t :
ta < t < tr is shown on this gure in bold (two disconnected parts).
in further evolution small part is expanded and recombinates with long part in point r.
after recombination new small part is shrinked in point b, and new long part continues
to move in right-upward direction.

straight lines, passing through points i = a,b + 2n, i = 1, 2, n  z, correspond
to cusp lines on the world sheet. on these lines q0() changes its sign. vertical grey
bands show regions with q0(1) < 0, horizontal grey bands correspond to q0(2) < 0.

example 3. a0() = 1 + 4 cos 2 + 2 cos 3  2 sin 3, see g.8. this supporting curve
contains two non-monotonous intervals in each period. their interference leads to more
complicated processes, particularly, appearance of closed strings in the evolution, see
g.9.

is permanently present in the sys-
tem. the common features of its

string dynamics for example 3. on the rst frame the following 4 disconnected ele-

ments can be found: z-shaped long open string in the center, two shorter open strings in the
corners of supporting curve and closed string b, looking like a buttery. in the process of further
evolution the long string recombinates with shorter strings, adopting the shape of reverted z
(frame 5). on frame 3 the closed string b disappears, and new closed string b appears. on
frame 6 it enters into recombination with the long string and is included in it. there are no
closed strings on frame 7, here the long string in the center is connected. on the frame 8 the
string b is detached from the long string. the frame 9 coincides with the frame 1, and the
evolution is repeated again.

example 4. a0() = cos , see g.10. for this supporting
curve the period is space-like: p = (0, /2, 0), p 2 < 0.
correspondent world sheet is stretched not in time direc-
tion, but in the space one. there is no center-of-mass frame
for this system. in such cases one can use simultaneous ref-
erence frame, where the period has purely space direction
(like in given example). in this frame the world sheet has
nite size in temporal direction, the evolution is restricted
in time, see g.11.
in other reference frames the world
sheet is sloped to time axis, the formation of strings, ap-
pearing in equal-time slice, has nite spatial sizes. it moves
with the mean velocity, equal to the slope | ~p|/p0, which is
greater than 1, the light velocity in our units. however,
we will show in the next section, that all parts of this sys-
tem do not exceed the light velocity. this motion is shown
on g.12. it becomes clear from this gure, that there is
no direct hyper-light transfer of the system, this transfer
occurs through a sequence of creation, annihilation and re-
combination processes. not initial string but its exact copy
approaches the nite point.

1.2. energetic ows on the world sheet.

lets consider a connected component in equal-time slice of the world sheet. total

momentum of this component is given by the formula, derived in appendix 2:

where (1, 2)i,f are respectively initial and nal points of the component on the param-
eters plane. for appearing/disappearing component (e.g. short component, shown in
bold on g.7) we immediately have

p = 1

2 (q(1) + q(2))(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

(,)

(both ends of the string lie on the same edge of the world sheet).

for the permanent component, which starts and ends on dierent edges, we have

thus, total momentum and angular moment for appearing/disappearing components
vanish, and creation/annihilation processes do not violate the conservation laws. for
permanent component total momentum and angular moment are presented as complete
parametric invariants of the supporting curve, independent on the position of ends (, ),
thus, they are conserved in evolution.

vanishing of total energy for non-permanent component implies, that density of en-
ergy is not everywhere positive on the string. in appendix 2 we derive a formula for
linear density of energy dp0/dl, dl = |d~x|  element of length on equal-time slice:

(6)

dp0
dl

= sign(q10q20) s 2q10q20

(q1q2)

.

remark: argument of this square root is not negative, because it can be presented in the
form 2(n1n2)1, where ni = qi/qi0 are light-like vectors, directed into the future.

for monotonous supporting curves (q0 > 0) dp0/dl is always positive. for non-
monotonous supporting curves the density of energy on the string changes its sign in
passage through the cusps (where the sign of (q10q20) is changed). parts of the world
sheet, shown on g.7 in white and double grey, have positive density of energy; parts,
shown in grey, correspond to negative density. signs of density of energy are also shown
on the world sheet g.5. in recombination process, shown on g.6, the density of energy
is positive on the segments l, b, c, e, and negative on the segments a, d.

1.3. gauges. virasoro constraints generate reparametrizations of supporting curve
(see appendix 1). gauges to virasoro constraints select particular parametrization on
this curve. for example, the curve can be parameterized by cone time:   (kq) with
k2 = 0, e.g. k = (1, 1, 0, 0...).
in this parametrization (light cone gauge) virasoro
constraints can be explicitly resolved:

q = (q0  q1)/2,

~q = (q2, ..., qd1), q


~q2
  0.
another possibility is to parameterize the curve by the time in cmf (for p 2 > 0):
  (p q). such gauge was originally considered by rohrlich [2]. in this case q0 =
| ~q| = p 2/ > 0 (q0 is a component of q along p, ~q is a component, orthogonal to
p).

= p/ > 0, q+ = 

2p

the both parametrizations can be introduced only on monotonous supporting curves,
because we require that the component of q along gauge axis (k or p) should be
monotonous in . as a result, exotic solutions are absent in light cone and rohrlichs
gauges. non-monotonous supporting curves can be considered in parametrization of
another type, see appendix 5.

1.4. regge condition.

for normal solutions the spatial components of angular
moment mij in cmf satisfy the following inequality: |mij|  p 2/2. it can be proven by
purely geometrical methods, see appendix 3. alternatively, we can write the constraint
l0 = 0  p 2/2 = pn>0 an an

for exotic solutions the rohrlichs gauge cannot be xed, and negative contribution of

example 5: a() =  cos 2 (1, cos , sin ). in this case p = 0 (supporting curve is

for normal solutions we can introduce the light cone gauge q/p = , in this case
~an coincide with transverse oscillator variables ~an = r 2

parametrically-invariant expression for them). for normal solutions the set of variables
{ ~an} denes the supporting curve uniquely (up to translations and reparametrizations).
for exotic solutions we cannot introduce the light cone gauge, but variables ~an are
still dened, both for time-like and space-like p. in this case the supporting curve is
not uniquely dened by { ~an}, see appendix 4. a deformation of supporting curve is
possible, preserving { ~an}.

remark.

fig.13. the set of ddf variables denes unique sup-
porting curve in sector of normal solutions, and a family
of supporting curves in exotic sector.

in theories with gauge symmetries the actual phase space is formed by a complete
set of gauge-invariant variables. other variables can be ignored, because their varia-
tion transforms the system along gauge equivalent states, indistinguishable physically.
all states of the system, correspondent to the same values of gauge invariants, can be
identied(4).

in string theory variables { ~an} together with total momentum and mean coordinate
can be taken as such complete set only for normal solutions. in this case other dynamical
variables inuence only parametrization of supporting curve and do not inuence physical
observables.

(4) for details of this procedure, known as gaugeless reduction, see [4].

exotic solutions in string theory

11

for exotic solutions it is not so. a family of curves q() exist, dierent by their
shape, which correspond to the same set { ~an}, see g.13. identication of all states with
xed { ~an} will lead to mixing of exotic and normal states, i.e. identication of physically
distinct states. later we will show, that such identication occurs in standard covariant
quantization of string theory.

2.  exotic solutions in lagrangian theory

action of the string is dened as

a =z l d1d2, l =p(1x 2x)2  (1x)2(2x)2,

 = /.

the world sheets, considered in the previous section, have the following properties:

1. they belong to the class open string: innite band, mapped to minkowsky space.
the only dierence from the usually considered world sheets is that now this mapping is
not trivial (has a fold, see gs.4,5).

2. the argument of the square root in l for these surfaces is not negative: (q1q2)2/16 
0. such surfaces are usually called time-like: in each regular point of the surface one of
two tangent vectors q1  q2 is time-like, another one is space-like. this also implies,
that velocity of points on the string does not exceed the light velocity(5).

3. the argument of the square root in l vanishes on the cusp lines (gs.5,7): (q1q2)2/16 =
0. there are two possibilities for a choice of sign of the square root in passage through
the cusp line:

a) non-negative value is chosen for the square root: l = |q1q2|/4. in this case we
can show (see appendix 2), that lagrange-euler equations on each of two patches of the
world sheet, separated by the cusp line, are satised, but the boundary conditions on the
cusp line are not: momentum, owing from one patch, is not equal to the momentum,
entering into another patch.
in this case the considered world sheet is not extremal
surface for action a.

b) the square root changes sign in passage through the cusp line: l = (q1q2)/4,
sign(q1q2) = sign(q10q20) (parts, marked by + and  on g.5, contribute to the action
with opposite signs). the string, whose lagrangian changes sign in passage through
singular points (polarized strings) were initially considered in work [5]. in this case
the lagrange-euler equations and boundary conditions are satised, and the extremum
of action is reached on considered surface.

thus, exotic solutions of covariant hamiltonian theory correspond to solutions of

lagrangian theory of type b. in the case a such solutions should be excluded.

(5) considering equal-time slices of the world sheet in the vicinity of regular point, the action
can be rewritten in the form r p1  v2
dtdl, where dl is element of length on equal-time slice
and ~v is a component of velocity, orthogonal to a string: only this component has physical
(parametrically invariant) sense. for time-like surfaces |~v|  1.

exotic solutions it is not so: in white regions of g.7 x2 < 0,
x0 > 0; in grey
regions x2 > 0,
x2 > 0, but x0 < 0. usually
such solutions are rejected from consideration on early stage of theory construction, by
explicit requirement x2 < 0,
[6]. this requirement, however,
remains unused in further development of the theory. to exclude the exotic solutions
from hamiltonian theory, one should explicitly impose the requirement a0() > 0 . in
the space of oscillator variables {an
0} this requirement denes a region (linearly connected
0 = p0/). boundary of this region is composed of patches,
and compact for each xed a0
whose explicit expression can be found in exclusion of variable z = ei from the system
a0(z) = 0, a0(z) = 0. for nite number of excited oscillators this expression can be
written as polynomial of oscillator variables [7], with the degree, increasing together
with the number of excited oscillators. needless to say, that determination of this region
is a hard problem. until it will not be solved, exotic solutions exist in hamiltonian
theory, and should also be present on a quantum level.

x2 < 0; in double grey regions x2 < 0,

x0 > 0, see e.g.

x2 > 0,

3.  exotic solutions in quantum theory

standard covariant quantization of string theory works in 26-dimensional minkowsky
space. physical space of states is dened as ln|physi = 0, n  0 (only a half of
constraints is imposed). in this theory the property a0() > 0 cannot be directly tested,
because operator a0() does not commute with ln and, consequently, does not take
denite values on the physical vectors. only indirect methods can be used for study of
exotic sector in quantum theory.

square of strings mass is dened by the expression p 2/2 = p an+

level, has absolutely dierent mechanism, than the requirement a0() > 0. actually, this
is not the exclusion of these states, but another denition of their square of mass. this
redenition maps the regions in the phase space, violating positiveness of p 2 and regge
condition, to the regions of spectrum, where these conditions are not violated.

now lets consider ddf states qn<0,i(ani)kni|0i, operators ani are dened by ex-
pression (8) (no special ordering is required). on these states an
|ddfi = 0, n > 0,
classically this corresponds to a() = const, i.e. light cone parametrization. due to the
theorem [8], any physical state can be presented in a form |physi = |ddfi +|spi, where
|ddfi belongs to the space, covered by ddf-states, and |spi is a spurious state, which
has zero norm and is orthogonal to all states in the physical space. first of all, note
that exotic solutions necessarily have non-constant a(). consequently, they cannot
correspond to pure ddf-states, but should have non-zero spurious component. then,
actual space of states is obtained in factorization of the physical space by spurious states:
|ddfi + |spi  |ddfi. this factorization is equivalent to one described in subsection
1.5, which leads to identication of normal and exotic solutions.

remarks.

1. such situation occurs in standard representation of quantum string theory. in work
[9] alternative representation was considered. it was shown, that in pseudo-euclidean
space, containing equal number of spatial and temporal directions (e.g.
in d = 3 + 3),
quantum string theory can be represented in positively dened extended space of states,
where correspondent virasoro algebra has zero central charge. in this theory the square
of strings mass has the expression, analogous to (7), but all occupation number operators
in this theory take positive eigenvalues. as a result, tachionic regions of classical theory
are preserved in quantization.

2. light cone and rohrlichs gauges exclude exotic solutions on the classical level. corre-
spondent quantum theory also does not contain the exotic solutions. it is well known for
standard light cone quantization, applicable in 26 dimensions. in works [10-12] special
subsets in the phase space of 4-dimensional open string theory were considered, for which
the quantization in rohrlichs gauge and in (slightly modied) light cone gauge has no
anomalies. the obtained spectra also do not contain the exotic sector.

quantum string theory in the gauge, described in appendix 5, is anomaly-free as well.

it contains exotic solutions classically and preserves them on the quantum level.

conclusion

we considered a class of solutions in nambu-goto theory of open string, which cor-

respond to the world sheets, mapped in minkowsky space with a fold.

1. such solutions exist in covariant hamiltonian formulation of the theory. typical
processes for these solutions are creation of strings from vacuum, their recombination
and annihilation. these solutions can violate positiveness of square of mass and regge
condition |mij|  p 2/2. such solutions are present, until a special requirement a0() >
0 will be explicitly imposed.
in non-covariant formulations the exotic solutions are absent for commonly used
gauges (rohrlichs and light cone) and present for a gauge of special type, described
here in appendix 5.

14

s.v.klimenko, i.n.nikitin

2. in lagrangian formulation a behavior of the square root in lagrangian near its branch-
ing point plays dening role. if positive sign of the square root is chosen, the exotic so-
lutions are absent (and should be excluded from correspondent hamiltonian theory). if
lagrangian changes its sign in passage through the branching point, the exotic solutions
are present.

3. in covariant quantum theory imposition of the requirement a0() > 0 is a subtle task.
until this requirement is not imposed, the exotic solutions are present.

standard covariant quantization of string theory operates in the space of states with
indenite metric. this leads to redenition of strings square of mass, which maps the
regions of classical theory with p 2 < 0 and |mij| > p 2/2 to the regions of quantum
spectra with p 2 > 0 and |mij| < p 2/2. after that redenition, the exotic solutions
correspond to physical states |ddfi + |spi with non-zero spurious component. factor-
ization of the physical space by spurious states leads to mixing of exotic and normal
solutions.

an example of covariant quantization of string theory in positively dened extended

space of states is known, which contains exotic solutions in spectrum.

in non-covariant quantization the gauges, excluding exotic solutions classically, do
not have them on the quantum level. the gauge, considered in appendix 5, contains the
exotic solutions classically and preserves them on the quantum level.

finally, we want to describe the following problem, which we foresee in further devel-
opment of string theory. one day somebody can nd quantum representation of string
theory in d = 3 + 1, which will be free of anomalies and will operate in positively dened
extended space of states. this theory, however, necessarily should contain exotic states.
their exclusion is possible only in specic gauges, which do not contain exotic solutions
classically. this requirement narrows the class of admissible gauges.

appendix 1. geometrical reconstruction of the world sheets

properties 1,2 of supporting curve follow from its denition. property 3 follows from 4 and 2.
lets prove the property 4:

(9)

x(,  ) = (q(1) + q(2))/2,

1,2 =   .

this formula was obtained in [1] by direct solution of hamiltonian equations in (x, p)-representation.
here we will reproduce the proof of this formula in oscillator representation.

hamiltonian of the system is an arbitrary linear combination of virasoro constraints: h =

p cklk (ck = ck). coecients ck inuence only parametrization of the world sheet. the
choice h = l0 corresponds to conformal parametrization (where (x  x)2 = 0). this hamil-
tonian generates phase rotations an
(0)ein and shifts x( ) = x(0) + (p/) .
using (3), we see that the evolution of function q() is the shift of its argument: q(,  ) =
q( + , 0). then, using (2), we have the following evolution for coordinates and momenta:
p(,  ) = (q( + , 0) + q(  , 0))/2.

x(,  ) = (q( + , 0) + q(  , 0))/2,

( ) = an

introducing isotropic coordinates 1,2 =   , obtain formula (9).

q() =
we have {q(), q2()/4} = (  )q(), and for h = r d f ()q2()/4 :
{q(), h} = f ()q(), linear combinations of constraints generate shifts of points in tangent
direction to the supporting curve, or equivalently  reparametrizations of this curve.
reduced phase space of string, obtained in factorization of the phase space by the action of
gauge group, is actually a set of all possible supporting curves, which are considered as geometric
images, without respect to their parametrization (two dierent parametrizations of the curve
correspond to the same point of the reduced phase space). all physical observables in string
theory are parametric invariants of supporting curve. the world sheet is also reconstructed by
the supporting curve in parametrically invariant way, see g.1.

appendix 2. densities of momentum and angular moment

action of the string is equal to an area of the world sheet

a =z l d1d2, l =p(1x 2x)2  (1x)2(2x)2 =q 1

where 12 = 21 = 1, 11 = 22 = 0. ld1d2 is tensor element of area.

dimensional constant, dening the tension of the string. in our work we choose the system of
units 2 = 1.

16

s.v.klimenko, i.n.nikitin

also the sign minus is usually introduced in the action of the string, by analogy with the
mechanics of point particle, where a = ms, s is interval of the world line. this sign is actually
needed only at the choice of metric with signature ( + +). for this choice it provides
positiveness of energy (time component of covariant vector p = g l/ x), see table below
(~v = d~x/dx0,  = (1  v2)1/2):

for signature (+   ), adopted in our work, positive lagrangian corresponds to positive
energy. analogously, the choice of sign plus in strings action corresponds to positive density of
energy for normal solutions (see below).

2. in the points of the world sheet, where l = 0, p
 has a singularity. such cases are often
rejected from consideration (see e.g. [6]). this rejection has no ground. it is shown in [14], that
points with l = 0 for the theory in 3- and 4-dimensional minkowsky space are topologically
stable. they do not disappear in small deformations of the world sheet. such singular cases
occupy volumes in the phase space (are not rare). for the world sheets, considering in our work,
l = 0 on cusp lines (where 1x or 2x vanishes). thus, such singular cases should be considered
in details.
lets subdivide the world sheet into patches with l 6= 0, separated by lines with l = 0
(isolated points with l = 0 are also rejected from the patches). variation of action in inner
regions of l 6= 0 patches gives equations (10) for these regions. due to these equations, variation
of action is reduced to boundary terms: a =pirbi
d
is a dierential ow of momentum through the element d, see g.15. this expression is well
dened, only if dp has nite limits on the boundary, correspondingly dp +
 and dp  for each
of two patches, adjacent to d.

  dp  ), where dp = p

x(dp +

annulation a = 0 for any x implies, that dp +

 = dp  , limits of dierential ows should
coincide on the boundary. in other words: momentum, owing from one patch, should be equal
to momentum, entering into another patch, so that momentum conservation is satised globally
on the world sheet(8). (for isolated singular point the momentum, owing through a closed
contour around this point should vanish. analogously, boundary condition on a free edge of the
world sheet has a form dp = 0  ow of momentum through the free edge should vanish.)

dp+

d

fig.15. flows of momentum through the line l = 0.

lets substitute the representation of the world sheet x(1, 2) = (q(1)+q(2))/2 into (10):

1,2x = q1,2/2, l = q1[q2]/4,  1

2ll = (q1q2)2/16,

(8) in this work we actually consider only such world sheets, for which the nominator in p

vanishes simultaneously with the denominator, and resolution of this 0/0 ambiguity gives smooth
(c) function p
(1, 2). for such world sheets the limits dp  automatically coincide, and the
equations p

 = 0 have sense everywhere on the world sheet.

exotic solutions in string theory

17

l = (q1q2)/4, p

1,2 = q(2,1)/2,

consequently, the equations (10) are valid: 1p1 = 2p2 = 0. boundary conditions on a free
edge are also satised (e.g.
for the edge 1 = 2 we have p1 = p2, d1 = d2  dp =
p1d2  p2d1 = 0). thus, the world sheets of the form x = (q1 + q2)/2 satisfy lagrange-
euler equations and boundary conditions, also in the case, if the supporting curve q() is not
monotonous.

remark: this result is valid in the case of lagrangian theory of type b, see section 2. for the
theory of type a we obtain l = |q1q2|/4, p
 is
discontinuous on cusp lines g.7. in this case the ows dp  do not coincide on the cusp lines
for 1 = a,b + 2n we have dp +  dp  = q2d2 6= 0). further consideration is
(e.g.
concerned to the theory of type b.

1,2 = q(2,1)/2  sign(q10q20), function p

the momentum, owing through the element (d1, d2), is given by an expression

(11)

dp  = p

d = (q1d1 + q2d2)/2.

calculatingr dp  along the curve, connecting points (1, 2)i and (1, 2)f , obtain formula (4).

density of angular moment:

this formula can be identically rewritten to the form (5).

lets derive a formula (6) for linear density of energy on the string. lets consider equal-time

to nd the sign of d2, lets consider normal element d = (d2,d1), see g.14.
expression (11) actually represents the ow of momentum in the direction of normal element.
in our case the normal element should correspond to the lorentz vector (q1d2  q2d1),
directed into the future. in this case we calculate the ow of momentum through the equal-time
slice from past to the future. this ow is usually identied with total momentum of the string.
thus, q10d2  q20d1 > 0  (q10 + (q20)2/q10)d2 > 0, sign d2 = sign q10. from (12)
we also have sign d1 =  sign q20. these relations dene global orientation for each connective
component in equal time slice, shown by arrows on solid lines on g.7. arrows on dashed lines
dene the direction into the future. these two kinds of arrows are everywhere related by the
rule, depicted on g.14.

finally, from (13) we have (6).

2 sij , sij is oriented area,
restricted by a projection of supporting curve onto a plane (ij). for this area the following
ij /4  l2/4 = p 2/, where lij and l are total lengths of
inequalities are valid:
supporting curve in projection to (ij)-plane and to space component of cmf respectively.

2h qidqj = 1

remarks.

1. here the rst inequality follows from well-known geometrical fact: among all planar curves
the ratio ( area / square of length) reaches maximum on a circle. the last identity is due to

0 d| ~q| = l.

0 da0 =r 2

2p0 =r 2
2. equality |mij| = p 2/2 is reached on the supporting curve, whose projection to space
component of cmf is a circle (lying in (ij)-plane). correspondent string is a straight line,
rotating at constant angular velocity in cmf [10].

3. for exotic solutions this argumentation is not valid. in this case mij = sij /2 as earlier, but
2p0 = l+  l, where l+ is total length of parts of supporting curve with a0() > 0; l is
length of parts with a0() < 0. generally 2p0  l = l+ + l.

appendix 5. tangent angle gauge

lets transfer the mechanics to cmf: introduce orthonormal basis of vectors n 

 (p ) :
 = p/p 2, and decompose the supporting curve by this basis:
 a(), etc. for the components a() we write the follow-

 q(), a() = n 

 n

n 
q() = n 
ing parametrization:

(14)

a() = a0() (1, cos( + ), sin( + )),

nein, n = n.
da() = 2(p 2,~0) we have 0 = p 2/, 1 = 1 = 0.

a0() =xn

substituting this parametrization into general symplectic form, dening the string dynam-

 here z is canonical mean coordinate, conjugated to p (compare with [10]). from these ex-
pressions one can obtain q(0) as a function of z and oscillator variables, and then reconstruct
the supporting curve as q() = q(0) + q().
2h q1dq2 is strings angular moment in cmf (spin). here we consider d = (2 + 1)-
 s = 1
dimensional minkowsky space, where the spin is a scalar variable, which can take both signs.

the obtained symplectic form corresponds to the following poisson brackets:

{z, p} = g,

{s, } = 1,

{n, m} = i1n(n2  1)nm, n, m  2.

its convenient to introduce new oscillator variables:
an = 1/2(n(n2  1))1/2 n,

{an, am} = inm.

substituting (14) into the denition of spin, we obtain a constraint (mass shell condition):

(15)

 =

p 2

2  s xn2

n anan = 0.

this constraint should be used as hamiltonian of the system. one can easily prove, that it
generates the reparametrization of supporting curve q()  q( +  ).

generators of lorentz group are dened by expression, analogous to written in [10]:

(16)

m = x[p] + sn 1

[n 2
].

they generate lorentz transformation of a coordinate frame (n 0
i ), ~e1 = (cos , sin ), ~e2 =
( sin , cos ), by which the supporting curve is decomposed with scalar (-independent) coef-
cients.

remarks.

1. parameter  =  +  is equal to polar angle of vector ~q(), tangent to the supporting curve
on cmf plane, see g.17. (thats why we call this parametrization as tangent angle gauge,
tag). function a0() is equal to the radius of curvature a0 = dq0/d = dl/d = r.

(9) for the details of this technique see [10, 12].

20

s.v.klimenko, i.n.nikitin

2. tag describes only those supporting curves, for which (i) during the passage along the curve
the tangent vector is rotated always in the same direction (supporting curve has no inection
points), and (ii) this vector performs one complete revolution in one complete passage (winding
number of the curve  = 1). according to [14], such supporting curves correspond to a class of
initial data, for which singular points do not appear in the evolution. (generally, the dynamics
of open string in (2 + 1)-dimensional minkowsky space contains stable singularities, which have
a form of cusps, moving along the string at light velocity. number of permanent cusps, which
inections of the supporting curve correspond to
do not appear or disappear, equals   1.
creation/annihilation of cusps. for the supporting curves with  = 1 and without inections
the cusps are absent.) tag also includes the supporting curves, for which the function a0()
is not positive (those, for which p 2 > 0 and polar angle of vector d ~q/dq0 is monotonic in ,
see g.17). thus, tag includes the solutions from normal sector, for which the string has no
cusps, and a denite admixture of solutions from exotic sector.

3. region of variation of variables (p 2/2, s) and typical examples of supporting curves are
shown on g.18a. normal solutions occupy on this plane the sector 0  s  p 2/2. for exotic
solutions s  p 2/2, here s is not bounded from below (see (15)), exotic solutions violate the

quantization of this mechanics is straightforward. canonical operators:

[z, p ] = ig

[s, ] = i,

[an, a+

m] = nm, n, m  2.

(a+

k )nk|0i, with the occupation numbers nk = a+

1nk !

oscillator part of the mechanics can be realized in a positively dened fock space: ak|0i =
0, |{nk}i =qk2
k ak = 0, 1, 2... complete
space of states can be dened as a direct product of this fock space onto the space of functions
(p, ), 2-periodic for , with denition of operators z = i/p, s = i/ (eigenvalues
s  z). physical subspace is selected by the constraint (p 2/2  s p knk)|physi = 0.
p 2/2  s = t, t = pk2 knk = 0, 2, 3.... the multiplicity of states is constant on the
|0i, t = 2 :
trajectory and is equal to multiplicity of eigenstates of operator t , e.g. t = 0 :
|12i, t = 3 : |13i, t = 4 : |22i,|14i (2 states), etc.
remark: in our approach z, p and s are taken as independent canonical variables, for which

correspondent spin-mass spectrum is shown on g.18b. it consists of linear regge trajectories

the commutators are postulated directly from poisson brackets. it was shown in [10], that in
this case the lorentz generators, dened by expression (16), have no anomaly in commutators.
