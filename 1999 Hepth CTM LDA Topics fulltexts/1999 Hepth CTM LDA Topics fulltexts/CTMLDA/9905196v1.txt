we argue that the wess-zumino model with quartic superpotential admits static solutions in which
three domain walls intersect at a junction. we derive an energy bound for such junctions and show
that congurations saturating it preserve 1/4 supersymmetry.

domain walls arise in many areas of physics. they
occur as solutions of scalar eld theories whenever the
potential is such that it has isolated degenerate minima.
there are two circumstances in which this happens natu-
rally. one is when a discrete symmetry is spontaneously
broken; in this case the degeneracy is due to the symme-
try. the other is when the eld theory is supersymmetric;
in this case the potential is derived from a superpoten-
tial, the critical points of which are degenerate minima of
the potential. a simple supersymmetric model illustrat-
ing the latter case is the (3+1 dimensional) wess-zumino
(wz) model with a superpotential w () that is a poly-
nomial function of the complex scalar eld . the static
domain wall solutions of this theory preserve 1/2 the su-
persymmetry and are associated with a two-form central
charge in the supertranslation algebra [1]. they can be
viewed as solitons in a dimensionally reduced 1+1 di-
mensional theory in which the 2-form charge is realized
as a scalar central charge in a 1+1 dimensional (2,2)-
supersymmetry algebra [2].

intersections of domain walls are also of interest and
have been extensively studied [35] in the context of a
theory with a single real scalar eld on e3. static con-
gurations are presumed to satisfy an equation of the
form

2 = v () ,

(1)

where 2 is the laplacian on e3 and v () is a positive
real function of  with two adjacent isolated minima at
which the function v vanishes. let these minima be at
 = 1 and let (x, y, w) be cartesian coordinates for e3.
if one assumes that   1 as x  , uniformly
in y and w, then solutions of (1) are necessarily planar
because all [610] such solutions satisfy the rst order
ordinary dierential equation

= v .

d
dx

(2)

the solutions of this equation are the static domain walls,
which are stable for topological reasons.

now consider the possibility of static intersecting do-
main wall solutions of (1). an existence proof has been
given [3] showing that (1) admits a solution representing
two orthogonal domain walls. the solution has dirichlet
type boundary data :  = 0 on the planes x = 0 and

1

y = 0 and   1 as |x|   within the rst quadrant.
given that the solution exists in the rst quadrant, it
may be obtained in the remaining quadrants by reec-
tion. it seems clear, although we are unaware of formal
proofs, that there should also exist solutions for which
2n domain walls intersect, adjacent walls making an an-
gle /n. however all these intersecting solutions are ex-
pected to be unstable; it is certainly the case that they
cannot be supersymmetric. we shall return to this point
later.

domain walls with two or more scalar elds have been
investigated in [4,5,11]. in [4,5], three-phase boundaries
were shown to minimise the energy and to correspond,
in the thin-wall limit, to a y-intersection (with 120 de-
gree angles). the wz model is a special case of models
of this type. the energetics of domain wall intersections
in the wz model was investigated in [1]. the possibil-
ities depend on the form of the superpotential w . if it
is cubic then there are two possible domains and only
one type of domain wall separating them. intersections
of two such walls cannot be more than marginally sta-
ble. stable intersections can occur only if the superpo-
tential is at least quartic. a quartic superpotential can
therefore model a tri-stable medium with three possible
stable domains and three types of domain wall. the 1+1
dimensional analysis of [1] indicates that triple intersec-
tions of the three walls should be stable for some range of
parameters, but static solutions representing such inter-
sections are intrinsically 2+1 dimensional (given that we
ignore dependence on the coordinate of the string inter-
section), so they cannot be found from the truncation to
1+1 dimensions. however, they should be minimum en-
ergy solutions of the reduction of the wz model to 2+1
dimensions. the energy density of static congurations
in this reduced 2+1 dimensional theory is

h =

1
4    + |w ()|2

(3)

where  = (x, y) with (x, y) being cartesian coordi-
nates for the two-dimensional space.
let z = x + iy. the above expression for the energy

density can then be rewritten as

h = (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

where  is an arbitrary phase, and

where  is the 2-form on 2-space induced by the closed 2-
form d d  on the target space (assumed here to be the
complex plane). since  is closed, q is a real topological
charge. we may assume without loss of generality that
it is non-negative. integration over space then yields the
following expression for the energy

e = z dzdz (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

where

we thereby deduce the bogomolnyi-type bound

e  q + |t| ,

which is saturated by solutions of the bogomolnyi equa-
tion


z

= eiw  .

(10)

before considering what solutions this equation may
have, we shall rst show that generic solutions preserve
1/4 supersymmetry. the elds of the wz model reduced
to 2+1 dimensions comprise a complex scalar  and a
complex sl(2; r) spinor eld ; we use an sl(2; r)
notation in which

we see from (13) that purely bosonic congurations

are supersymmetric provided that the equation

  = 2w 

(15)

admits a solution for some constant complex spinor .
for a time-independent complex eld  this equation is
equivalent to

(1  2) ( ) + (1 + 2) () = 2w  3

(16)
where   /z and   / z. for a eld  satisfying
(10) we deduce that  satises

2 =  ,

3 = ei .

(17)

these constraints preserve just one the four supersymme-
tries. solutions of (10) are therefore 1/4 supersymmetric.
we now return to the bogomolnyi equation (10). if 
is restricted to be a function only of x then this equation
reduces to the one studied in [1], which admits domain
wall solutions parallel to the y-axis. each domain wall
is associated with a complex topological charge of mag-

nitude |r dx xw| and phase . the question of stable

intersections was adressed in [1] by asking whether two
domain walls parallel to the y-axis, at least locally, can
fuse to form a third domain wall of lower energy. it was
found that this is possible only if their phases dier; oth-
erwise, stability is marginal. given that the energetics
allows the formation of an intersection, we would like to
nd the static intersecting domain wall solution to which
the system relaxes. such solutions must depend on both
x and y (equivalently, on both z and z), and hence are
much harder to nd.

to simplify our task, we shall consider the simple quar-

and  = . similarly,  = . the
lagrangian density is

l =

(12)

note that the corresponding bosonic hamiltonian den-
sity is precisely (3). the action is invariant, up a surface
term, under the innitesimal supersymmetry transforma-
tions

 = 2i
 =    2w  ,

(13)

and their complex conjugates (we adopt the convention
that bilinears of real spinors are pure imaginary). the
corresponding noether charge is the complex sl(2; r)
spinor

(18)

this has three critical points, at  = 1, , 2, and a z3
symmetry permuting them. there are therefore three
possible domains and three types of domain wall sepa-
rating them. the bogomolnyi equation corresponding
to this superpotential is


z

= 1  3 .

(19)

we have set the phase  = 1 since it can now be removed
by a redenition of z. this equation is invariant under
the z3 action : (z, )  (z, ), so we are led to seek
a z3 invariant solution such that   1 as one goes to
innity inside the sector  
6 , subject to
the condition that arg  = arg z on the boundary. by
symmetry  must vanish at the origin and so   z for
small z. this is the rst term in an expansion of the form

given that a stable static triple intersection exists, there
should also exist stable networks of domain walls. for
example, one may imagine a static lattice consisting of
hexagonal domains, rather like graphite. the vertices
form triple intersections and one may consistently label
the hexagons of the array with 1, , 2, in such a way that
no two domains which touch along a common edge carry
the same label. the evolution of networks of domain
walls has been studied numerically in [12]. we believe
that it would be fruitful to study the wz model in this
context.

it is well known that topological defects such as strings
and domain walls admit wavelike excitations travelling
along them at the speed of light. the domain wall junc-
tions considered here are no exception. one easily checks
that the (3+1) dimensional wz equations are satised if
(z) solves our bogomolnyi equation (10) but is also al-
lowed to have arbitrary dependence upon either t  w or
t + w, where w is the coordinate on which we reduced
to get the (2+1) dimensional model. however, only one
choice preserves supersymmetry. to see this we note
that the sl(2; c)-invariant condition for preservation of
supersymmetry in the unreduced (3+1) dimensional wz
model is

    + 2w  = 0 .

(21)

given that the (2+1) dimensional bogomolnyi equation
is satised, and that the spinor  satises (17), we then
deduce that

+  = 0

(22)

where + = t  w, the sign depending on the choice
of conventions. thus, we again have 1/4 supersymmetry
if + = 0 but no supersymmetry if  = 0. this
result is not unexpected: it is an illustration of the third-
brane rule: given two intersecting branes preserving 1/4
supersymmetry one can add a third brane for free (in
the sense that no further supersymmetries are broken)
but only with one of the two possible orientations.

note that since an individual domain wall preserves
1/2 supersymmetry its low energy dynamics must be de-
scribed by a (2+1)-dimensional supersymmetric eld the-
ory with two supersymmetries (corresponding to n=1).
the two components of the spinor eld of this eec-
tive theory are the coecients of two nambu-goldstone
fermions associated with the broken supersymmetries.
the domain wall junction preserves only 1/4 supersym-
metry, so there must be a total of three nambu-goldstone
fermions localised on the intersecting domain wall con-
guration as a whole. only two of these are free to prop-
agate within the walls, so the third nambu-goldstone
fermion must be localised on the string junction. this
can also be seen by viewing the junction as a 1/2-
supersymmetric defect on a given wall. the fact that half

of the walls supersymmetry is preserved means that the
junctions low energy dynamics is desribed by a (1,0)-
supersymmetric (1+1) dimensional eld theory. this
theory is chiral with one fermion that is either left-moving
or right-moving; let us declare it to be left-moving. this
fermion is the nambu-goldstone fermion associated with
the fact that the junction also breaks half the walls su-
persymmetry. its bosonic partner under (1,0) supersym-
metry must also be left-moving.
it follows that right-
moving waves are supersymmetric whereas left-moving
ones are not, precisely as we deduced above from other
considerations.

now that we have a good understanding of the pattern
of supersymmetry breaking in the wz model we return to
the simpler model discussed earlier with one real scalar
eld. this model has an n=1 supersymmetrization in
(2+1) dimensions, with v = 4(w )2, obtained by re-
stricting all quantities in the n=2 model discussed above
to be real. taking y = 0 we then nd that solutions
of (2) are supersymmetric, with the real 2-component
spinor  an eigenspinor of 3. this might seem paradox-
ical in view of the fact that the n=1 (2+1)-dimensional
supertranslation algebra admits no central charges, of ei-
ther scalar or vector type, that are algebraically inde-
pendent of the 3-momentum. the resolution is that the
anticommutator of supersymmetry charges s is

{s, s} = h

+ (1) (px + ty) + (3) (py  tx)

(23)

where h is the hamiltonian, p is the eld 2-momentum

and t = r d2xw is a 2-vector topological charge. for

static solutions p vanishes, while yw vanishes for solu-
tions with y = 0. for such solutions we have

{s, s} = h + 3tx .

(24)

it follows that h  |tx|. field congurations that satu-
rate this bound preserve 1/2 the supersymmetry and are
associated with eigenspinors of 3, as claimed.

an intersecting domain wall solution in this n=1
(2+1)-dimensional model cannot satisfy (2) (because its
only static solutions are the planar domain walls) and this
means that it cannot be supersymmetric. in contrast to
the n=2 model, one cannot use supersymmetry to ar-
gue for the stability of domain wall junctions in the n=1
model. indeed, as we argued earlier, there are reasons
to believe that they will be unstable. from the perspec-
tive of supersymmetry the main dierence is that n=2
supersymmetry in (2+1) dimensions allows for 1/4 su-
persymmetric solutions with less symmetry than the 1/2
supersymmetric domain walls, whereas this is impossible
in a theory with n=1 for which the space spanned by the
supercharges has real dimension 2.

as a nal remark, we believe that the lagrangian den-
sity (12) should have a brane interpretation in which it
is the eective eld theory describing low energy uc-
tuations on a 2+1 dimensional intersection of m-branes

3

or type iib superstring branes. if this is the case then
the entire discussion above could be recast in m-theoretic
terms.
