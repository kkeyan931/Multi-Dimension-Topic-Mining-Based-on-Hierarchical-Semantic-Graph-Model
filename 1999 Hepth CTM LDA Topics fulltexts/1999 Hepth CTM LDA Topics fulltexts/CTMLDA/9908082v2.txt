abstract: we develop a graphical representation of polynomial invariants of unitary gauge

groups, and use it to nd the algebraic curve corresponding to a hyperkahler quotient of

a linear space. we apply this method to four dimensional ale spaces, and for the ak,

dk, and e6 cases, derive the explicit relation between the deformations of the curves away
from the orbifold limit and the fayet-iliopoulos parameters in the corresponding quotient

construction. we work out the orbifold limit of e7, e8, and some higher dimensional
examples.

1. introduction

the two dual descriptions of d-branes as gravitational solitons of supergravity theories

and as objects on which open strings can end make it possible to derive interesting new

relations between gauge theories and gravity/string-theory. a celebrated example of this is

the maldacena conjecture [1]. to generalize the maldacena conjecture to cases with more

complicated gauge groups and matter content, as well as to cases with less supersymmetry,

it is useful to study d-branes sitting on various spacetime singularities [2,3,4,5].

this method was pioneered in [6], where d-branes on orbifold singularities of the
type c2/zk were studied. it was shown that the gauge theory realized on the brane is
conveniently summarized by a quiver diagram from which one can read o the gauge

group structure and the matter content. the orbifolds studied in that paper gave rise to

quiver diagrams corresponding to the (extended) ak dynkin diagram; the generalization

to the d and e series, corresponding to non-abelian orbifolds, was given in [7]. in this

picture, the fayet-iliopoulos terms in the gauge theory are related to twisted sector moduli

of the orbifold, so that turning them on corresponds to blowing up the orbifold singularity.

more complicated orbifolds preserving less supersymmetry were studied in, e.g., [8,9].

a complementary picture of the same models can be found using t-duality: the

singularity generically transforms into a web of ns-branes [10] and the d-branes change

their dimension to give congurations of the hanany-witten type [11]. in this dual picture,

many features of the model become geometric. in particular, the fayet-iliopoulos terms

are interpreted as various distances between branes. in many ways this dual picture is

complementary to the original picture in that dierent things become easy to see whereas

others, simple in the original picture, become harder to deal with in the t-dual version of

the model. this t-duality has been studied in detail for the a-series [12] and the d-series

[13,14] but no duals have yet been found for the e-series.

one aim of this paper is to provide guidance to nding such a correspondence by

constructing the map between the fayet-iliopoulos parameters, corresponding to the po-

sitions of various branes, and the deformations of the curve. in this paper, we nd the

algebraic curve corresponding to any manifold that is a hyperkahler quotient [15,16] of a

linear space. such a quotient may be described in terms of a quiver diagram [6]. the

cases when it yields a four-dimensional ale manifold have been analyzed and have an

a-d-e classifcation [17,18]. in particular we include the fayet-iliopoulos parameters in

the calculation of the curve for the ak, dk and e6 cases. remarkably we nd that the

curve in the e6 case is identical to the seiberg-witten curve for certain n = 2 supercon-

formal yang-mills theories with e6 global symmetry and with the fayet-iliopoulos terms

playing the roles of chiral supereld vevs.

it would be interesting if some duality or

mirror symmetry were responsible for this apparent coincidence.

the paper is organized as follows. in section 2 we review the hyperkahler quotient in

n = 1 superspace [15,16]. in section 3, we describe the algebraic curves of these spaces,

and derive them from the n = 1 superspace description of the hyperkahler quotient for

the ak [19], dk [20], and ek cases. in section 4, we discuss a number of issues and consider

some higher dimensional examples outside the a-d-e classication.

2. hyperkahler quotients

the hyperkahler quotient was introduced in [15] and was given a full mathematically

rigorous presentation in [16]. it arises naturally when one gauges isometries of a nonlinear

-model [21] in such a way as to preserve four dimensional n = 2 supersymmetry.

in

components (n = 0), it is the quotient of a constrained submanifold (the zero-set of the

moment map [16]) by some real compact gauge group. in n = 1 superspace, the vector

multiplet relaxes a part of the constraints, leaving only a holomorphic constraint, and

enhances the gauge group to its complexication (subtleties pertaining to quotients by

noncompact groups are discussed in [16], p. 548).

explicitly, we want to consider the hyperkahler quotient construction of 4-dimensional

ale spaces [18]. we start with a quaternionic vector space that we describe as an even

dimensional complex space with n pairs of coordinates (z+, z). in the language of su-

persymmetry, each pair of complex coordinates is called a hypermultiplet, and in n = 1

superspace, these are pairs of chiral superelds. the kahler potential of the metric is the

superspace lagrangian [22]. the holomorphic moment map constraints take the form [15]

z+taz = (ta),

(2.1)

where the ta are generators of the gauge group (taken to be hermitian), and  is an

arbitrary characteri.e., a linear combination of the u (1) factors of the group:

z+taz = 0

= ba

a / any u (1)
a  any u (1).

(2.2)

in superspace, these are called fayet-iliopoulos terms. the kahler potential of the quotient
space is found by solving a set of real equations for the n = 1 vector superelds v a [15]:

z+ev ata ta z+  ztaev ata z = (ta) ,

(2.3)

and substituting the solution into the gauged at space kahler potential of the zs [15]:

z+ev ata z+ + zev ata z  v a (ta) ,

(2.4)

where  is an independent character. the particular choices of gauge groups and repre-

sentations are given in [18]; for a review see [19]. a summary is given in table 1:

table 1

in the table, each hyperkahler quotient by a product gauge group u (n1)  . . .  u (nk) is
represented as an extended dynkin diagram for the a-d-e series of lie groups; the ith

simple root, which has a label ni in the dynkin diagram, corresponds to a factor u (ni)

in the gauge group and each link between two roots i, j corresponds to a hypermultiplet
in the (ni, nj) representation1.

3. algebraic curves

as stated above, four dimensional ale hyperkahler manifolds are classied by the

extended dynkin diagrams corresponding to the a-d-e lie groups [17]. as complex man-
ifolds, they can be described by holomorphic curves in c3 with coordinates x, y, z. the

1 as the chiral superelds z that make up the hypermultiplet are always in conjugate repre-

sentations, the orientation of the links does not matter.

curves have a leading piece corresponding to the orbifold limit of the spaces, and defor-

mation parameters corresponding to the character (fayet-iliopoulos) terms of the quotient

construction. the curves are summarized in table 2:

table 2

the curve corresponding to a given hyperkahler quotient can be constructed by nd-

ing all the (gauge group) invariant holomorphic polynomials modulo the holomorphic con-

straints (2.2); for the a-d-e spaces, we nd exactly three polynomials that satisfy an

algebraic constraint, which, after suitable redenitions is precisely the equation of the cor-

responding algebraic curve. the construction is in the spirit of seibergs construction of

eective superpotentials [23].

we now describe the actual calculations. to nd the correct variables and derive the

curve it is useful to employ the following graphic bug calculus.

as described above, we can represent any hyperkahler quotient by a product gauge
group u (n1)  . . .  u (nk) as a quiver diagram,2 where the ith node, labeled ni, corre-
sponds to a u (ni) gauge group and each link (including orientation) between two nodes i, j
corresponds to a hypermultiplet in the (ni, nj) representation. it is therefore natural to
represent any invariant that can be obtained by multiplying the chiral elds of the model

as a closed oriented loop in the quiver diagram.

the holomorphic constraints (2.2) can be represented in bug calculus. each gauge

group (i.e., node) has its own constraint. for an endpoint the constraint is shown in

figure 1a and for a point in a chain the constraint is shown in figure 1b. for more

complicated junctions one generalizes this keeping in mind that the sign of each term is

2 a quiver diagram is essentially a dynkin diagram with arrows on the links indicating an

orientation; when we construct invariant polynomials, we need to keep track of the orientation.

figure 1: the bug calculus. bi is the fayet-iliopoulos parameter associated to the ith

node, and a vertical bar through the ith node represents a u (ni) kronecker-.

determined by the orientation of the link it sits on. this is shown for two of the junctions

that appear in this paper: the three and four-point vertices in figures 1c and 1d.

a second important ingredient is the so-called schouten identity. this allows us

to untwist various loops showing that complicated variables can be written as products of

simpler ones. they are derived by observing that the totally antisymmetric product of n+1

n-dimensional indices is identically zero. the simplest identity holds for one dimensional

matrices and simply says that one dimensional matrices commute. graphically this means

that on any node representing a u (1) gauge group we are allowed to split the lines and

reconnect them in any way as long as we respect the orientation of the loops.

the schouten identity for two dimensional matrices looks slightly more complicated.

it can be derived from

m [i1

k3 = 0.

k1 n i2

k2 k i3]

(3.1)

if we contract the indices we can derive the following identity appropriate for our purposes

tr({m, n}k) = tr(m n )tr(k) + tr(m k)tr(n ) + tr(n k)tr(m )  tr(m )tr(n )tr(k).
(3.2)

in principle we could also implement this identity graphically. however, in practice it is

easier to use it in algebraic form and then to go on and use the graphic methods on each

term separately.

these are all the tools we need to derive the algebraic curve for any hyperkahler

quotient corresponding to an arbitrary quiver diagram: we draw closed loops of increasing

order in the number of links, and use the bug calculus to nd the independent nonvanishing

invariants. in practice, we rst consider the orbifold limit, as then the relations between the

invariants are simpler; the nal calculations away from this limit then follow precisely the

same route, but yield many more terms. the independent invariants are good coordinates

on the moduli space. when we nd no new independent invariants, we have all the

coordinates of the moduli space. to nd the algebraic curve, we consider the product of

the highest order invariant with its orientation reversed image and use schouten identities

to express it as a product of lower invariants; for the dk and ek but not the ak cases, the

orientation reversed loop is proportional to the original invariant plus algebraic functions

of the lower invariants. for the ak and dk cases, the u (1) schouten identity is all we

need.

we illustrate the method with two examples: a3 and d4, and then describe our results
for the general case. figure 2 describes the full calculation for a3: 2a) shows the quiver
diagram, 2b) denes two of the independent variables, x, y , 2c) denes the variable z

and uses the relation 1b) to express other similar diagrams in terms of it (note that the
1 bi = 0), and nally, using the relation in 2c), 2d) gives

fayet-iliopoulos terms satisfy p4

for arbitrary k, the curve in the form analogous to (3.4) is

though they do not have a graphical representation, si, ti for i > k  3 are dened by the
recursion relations (3.10); we also need bi = 0 for i > k + 1, i = 0 for i < 1, and we take
bk+3i = 0, and not b4, for i = k  1. because of the initial conditions (3.11), si/s1 and
ti/t1 are polynomials in w .

the curve (3.12) can be put into the standard form by redenitions analogous to (3.6):

(3.15)

calculating the rst six examples, we are able to rewrite the curve (3.15) explicitly in

(3.17)

in the orbifold limit, bi = 0 which agrees with the entry for dk in table 2. after completing

our calculation, we realized that the same expression for the deformation in terms of the

fayet-iliopoulos parameters had been deduced by completely dierent methods in [20].

we note that the quantities that enter in both the ak and the dk cases are related to

the weights of the fundamental representation of the lie algebra in question. if we think

of each fayet-iliopoulos parameter as the simple root associated to its node in the dynkin

j=1 bj in the ak case and the bi (3.17) in
the dk case) are the weights of the fundamental representation. more precisely, since the

diagram, then the expressions that occur (pi

fayet-iliopoulos terms are scalars whose value may be freely chosen, the quantities entering
the curve should be associated with v   where  is the particular weight and v is a vector
of the same dimension as the rank of the group. this ensures that we can choose the

fayet-iliopoulos parameters to be zero, corresponding to a zero value for v and when we

turn on the fayet-iliopoulos parameters it corresponds to giving v a non-zero value such

that the quantities above agree. this observation will be used later to write the result for

the e6 curve in a nice form.

we now turn to the e-series. the labeling of the nodes for e6 is given in figure 6a),
and the invariant polynomials u, v and w are dened in figure 6b). the relation between
u and its orientation reversed image u is:

u + u = w 2 + aw w + av v + a0 ,

the fayet-iliopoulos parameters may be found by substituting (3.18), (3.19), (3.21), and

(3.22) into (3.20). direct evaluation leads to a horrible mess, but the polynomials may be

expressed in terms of casimir operators of e6; remarkably, when we do this, we nd the
algebraic curve given in [24]. we now present the details of this description.

the casimirs can be dened as the coecients of the polynomial

det (x  ) ,

(3.24)

where  is a matrix in the fundamental representation of e6. we can always rotate  into
some element in the cartan subalgebra vh where v is an arbitrary six dimensional vector.
an explicit representation for the matrices h can be found in terms of the weights  of

the fundamental representation, since the weight vectors can be thought of as normalized

eigenvectors of the cartan operators with the weights as eigenvalues. the cartan operators

are thus represented as diagonal matrices with the particular weights on the diagonal, and

we have

(3.25)

the terms on the diagonal are just the expressions for the weights in terms of the fayet-

iliopoulos parameters as discussed at the end of the derivation of the curve for the dk

case. thus we have found a way to express the casimirs in terms of the fayet-iliopoulos

parameters. more details as well as the nal result for the curve can be found in the

it is natural to conjecture that the relation between the deformation parameters of

the curve and the fayet-iliopoulos parameters follows the same pattern for the higher

exceptional algebras [25,26]. the fayet-iliopoulos are to be thought of as the simple roots

of the algebra and the casimirs of the fundamental representation of the algebra (expressed

in terms of the simple roots and thus in terms of the fayet-iliopoulos paramters) give the

deformation parameters of the curve.

we note that this explicit expression stands in contrast to the implicit one of [20],

which involves inverting elliptic integrals.

we now turn to the e7 and e8 cases.

figure 7: the e7 invariants and some useful matrices.

for e7 and e8, we consider only the orbifold limit (no fayet-iliopoulos terms). in

figure 7, the quiver diagram (figure 7a) and the basic invariant polynomials (figure 7b)

for e7 are shown. we have veried that all other possible invariants either vanish or are

polynomials in these basic variables. in the e7 case the orientation reversal of the highest
dimension graph x is just x, but when we multiply them together the result does not
immediately factorize into a sum over products of the basic lower dimensional variables. it
therefore turns out to be convenient do dene the traceless 2  2 matrices m, n and k as
in figure 6c. using the bug calculus it is possible to derive the following useful relations

tr (n k) = z2 ,
tr (m k) = y ,
tr (m n ) = z ,

(3.26)

using these matrices we can write the square of the highest dimensional invariant as
x 2 = y tr (m n kn ). to be able to use the schouten identity (3.2) we rewrite the trace
in terms of anticommutators by anticommuting the leftmost matrix all the way to the

tr(cid:0)n 2(cid:1) = 2y .

right. we can now rewrite the trace in terms of products of traces of fewer matrices. the

result, dropping terms that vanish, is

(3.27)

(3.28)

which, using the relations (3.26) gives the curve

tr (m n kn ) = tr (m n ) tr (kn )  1

figure 8: the e8 invariants and some useful matrices.

finally we turn to the e8 ale space; the quotient gauge group and matter content
are described by the quiver diagram in figure 8a), and the basic invariant polynomials

are dened in figure 8b). again, we have veried that all other possible invariants either

vanish or are polynomials in these basic variables. since there is only one u (1) group in this

case it is not possible to simply factorize the square of the highest dimensional invariant

x into a product of lower dimensional ones and we must again use the two dimensional
schouten identity (3.2). therefore it is useful to dene the traceless 2  2 matrices a, b
and c in figure 8c). using the bug calculus we derive the following identities

tr (abc) = x ,

tr (ab) = 0 ,

tr (bc) = z2 ,

(3.29)

tr(cid:0)a2(cid:1) = 2z ,
tr(cid:0)b2(cid:1) = 2y .

squaring the highest dimensional invariant x and using the one dimensional schouten
identity we can write the result as x 2 = tr (abcabc). rewriting the trace in terms of

anticommutators by using the same trick as in the e7 case we get

x 2 = tr (ac) tr(cid:0)ab2c(cid:1)  tr (bc) tr (acab) ,

and using the same trick once again on the traces with four matrices we nd

tr(cid:0)ab2c(cid:1) = 1
tr (acab) =  1

2 tr (ac) tr(cid:0)b2(cid:1) ,
2 tr(cid:0)a2(cid:1) tr (bc) .

finally, using (3.29), we arrive at the following result for the curve

x 2 + y 3 + z5 = 0 .

(3.30)

(3.32)

4. other examples

there is something a bit surprising about our calculations: aside from those few nodes

where we used the schouten identities, our calculations did not in any way refer to the

gauge group associated with each node of the quiver. thus if we change the dynkin indices

of those nodes where we did not use a schouten identity, we get the same invariants and

the same algebraic curve. however, when we consider the hyperkahler quotient, this is

clearly nonsensical: the delicate balance between the dimension of the gauge group and

the number of hypermultiplets is achieved only for the correct dynkin indices: e.g., for

d4, if the central node is changed from u (2) to u (n), the resulting hyperkahler quotient

has zero or negative dimension. the resolution of this paradox becomes clear when we

express the elds of the hypermultiplets in spherical-type coordinates, that is, in terms

of goldstone modes that transform under the gauge group (angles), and the invariants

(radii). when the dimension of the hyperkahler quotient is zero, the hypermultiplet

action depends only on the goldstone modes, and the invariants that live on the algebraic

curve do not enter the dynamics (one could imagine that under some circumstances these

invariants correspond to dynamically generated states of the theory, and then the nontrivial

hyperkahler quotient manifold would arise); if the hyperkahler quotient would give rise to

a negative dimension space, then the hypermultiplet action is not only independent of the

invariants, but even of some of the goldstone modes.

figure 9: some higher dimensional examples.

the graphical methods that we have developed can be used to nd the algebraic curves

for higher dimensional ale spaces. a few typical examples are shown in figure 9. we

have analyzed only the orbifold limits of these examples.

for figure 9a), there are nine linearly independent invariants as dened in figure

10. direct application of our method gives ten polynomial equations that these invariants

satisfy. however, a little calculation shows that these ten equations are generated by ve

equations, leaving a complex four dimensional space as expected from the hyperkahler

to express the casimirs in terms of the fayet-iliopoulos parameters, we write the weights

of the fundamental representation in terms of the simple roots and recall that each bi can
be thought of as the scalar product between the v and its corresponding simple root.5

4 after we completed our calculations, we were informed that such formulas are derived in

great generality in [28].

5 in these formulas, we have eliminated b7 using the relation p3

4 bi + 3b7 = 0. it is
straightforward to use this formula to eliminate one of b1, b2, b3, to get the expressions in terms of
the more standard simple roots. we have also switched the signs of b1, b2, b3 as compared to the
text to agree with the usual conventions for the simple roots, which do not agree with the signs
we read o from the quiver diagrams.

this gives the matrix v  h in terms of the fayet-iliopoulos terms and thus the casimir
operators (a.3). in our normalization, the weights have length squared    = 2
3 , which
corresponds to tr (tatb) = 3ab in the fundamental representation.
