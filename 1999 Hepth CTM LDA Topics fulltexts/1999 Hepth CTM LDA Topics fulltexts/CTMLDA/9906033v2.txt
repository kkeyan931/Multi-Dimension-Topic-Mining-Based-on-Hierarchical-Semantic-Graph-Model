it is shown that ia6 euler-calogero-moser model with certain external potential after the reduc-
tion to the invariant submanifold through the discrete symmetry coincides with the unconstrained
su (2) yang-mills mechanics originated from 4-dimensional su (2) yang-mills theory under the sup-
position of the spatial homogeneity of the gauge elds. based on this connection the equations of
motion of su (2) yang-mills mechanics in the limit of zero coupling constant are presented in a lax
form.

i. introduction

the calogero-sutherland-moser system [13] and its generalizations [46] (for a comprehensive review see [7,8])
arise in very dierent areas of theoretical physics like spin chain systems [9], 2-dimensional yang-mills theory [10],
black hole physics [11] and many others. over the past few years remarkable relation between the calogero-moser
systems and exact solutions of 4-dimensional supersymmetric gauge theories [12] has been found and the essential
progress has been driven in determination of seiberg-witten spectral curves. they were recognized as identical to
the spectral curves for elliptic su (n ) calogero-moser system [13]. furthermore the generalization of these relation
to the n = 2 supersymmetric gauge theories with general lie algebras and an adjoint representation of matter
hypermultiplet have been derived in [14] (for review of the recent results see e.g. [15]). nevertheless of the existence
of such a correspondence established on very general grounds, the pattern of relations between gauge theories and
integrable models is steel far from completion. in the present note we would like to point out simple relation existing
between su (2) yang-mills mechanics [16] of spatially homogeneous gauge elds (see also [17], [18] and references
therein) and the euler-calogero-moser model. to nd this relation we use the results of our previous paper [18]
where the unconstrained hamiltonian system equivalent to the su (2) gauge invariant dirac-yang-mills mechanics
of spatially homogeneous isospinor and gauge elds has been derived. beside this results we explore the method to
construct certain generalizations of the calogero-sutherland-moser models elaborated recently by a.polychronakos
[19]. the proposed method consist in the usage of the appropriate reduction of the original calogero model by a
subset of its discrete symmetries to invariant submanifold of the phase space.

the outline of our derivation the relations between su (2) yang-mills mechanics and euler-calogero-moser system
is as follows. we will start with demonstration that the unconstrained su (2) yang-mills mechanics presents the
euler-calogero-moser system of type id3, i.e. the inverse-square interacting 3-particle system with internal degrees
of freedom and related to the root system of simple lie algebra d3 [7,8] embedded in a fourth order external potential
written in the superpotential form. presenting the euler-calogero-moser system as the model describing the free
motion on the space spanned by symmetric matrices we show that such 6  6 matrix model after projection onto the
invariant submanifold of the phase space using the certain subset of discrete symmetries is equivalent to the derived
unconstrained su (2) yang-mills mechanics. finally we give a lax pair representation for the equations of motion of
su (2) yang-mills mechanics in the limit of zero coupling constant.

ii. hamiltonian reduction of yang-mills mechanics

the dynamics of su (2) yang-mills 1-form connection a in 4-dimensional minkowski space-time m4 is governed by

the conventional local functional

with coupling constant g. after the supposition of the spatial homogeneity of the connection a

a = 0 ,

(2.1)

(2.2)

(2.3)

the action (2.1) reduces to the action for the nite dimensional model, the so-called yang-mills mechanics (ymm)
described by the degenerate matrix lagrangian

ly mm =

1
2

tr(cid:0)(dta)(dta)t(cid:1)  v (a) ,

the entries of 3 3 matrix a are nine spatial components aai := aa
matricies a and dt denotes the covariant derivative

i of connection a := yaadt + aa

i adxi with pauli

due to the spatial homogeneity condition (2.3) all dynamical variables ya and aai are functions of time only. the
part of the lagrangian corresponding to the selnteraction of the gauge elds is gathered in the potential v (a)

(dta)ai = aai + gabcybaci .

(2.5)

to express the yang-mills mechanics in a hamiltonian form let us dene the phase space endowed with the canonical
symplectic structure and spanned by the canonical variables (ya, pya ) and (aai, eai) where

g2

v (a) =

4 (cid:0)tr2(aat )  tr(aat )2(cid:1) .

pya =

after legendre transformation the canonical hamiltonian is given by

hc =

1

tr(eet ) +

g2

4 (cid:0)tr2(aat )  tr(aat )2(cid:1) + gya tr(jaaet ) ,

where the matrix (ja)bc is dened by (ja)bc = abc. according to the denition of the canonical momenta (2.7),
the phase space is restricted by the three primary constraints

and the evolution of the system is governed by the total hamiltonian

ht = hc + ua

y (t) p a
y .

p a

y = 0

the conservation of constraints (2.10) in time entails the further condition on canonical variables

pya = 0  a = g tr(jaaet ) = 0 ,

(2.10)

(2.11)

(2.12)

which reproduces the derivative independent part of conventional non-abelian gauss law constraints and obey the
rst class constraints poisson brackets algebra

in order to project onto the reduced phase space let us single out the part of the gauge potentials aai, which is invariant
under gauge transformations. because under a gauge transformation the gauge potentials transforms homogeneously

{a, b} = abcc .

(2.13)

2

one can achieve the separation of gauge degrees of freedom using the well known polar decomposition for arbitrary
3  3 matrix

aai(, q) = oak()qki

(2.14)

where qij is a positive denite 3  3 symmetric matrix and o(1, 2, 3) = e1j3 e2j1 e3j3 is an orthogonal matrix
o  so(3), which can be viewed as the adjoint representation of the gauge group su (2) with the matrix realization
for the generators (jc)ab = cab obeying the so(3) algebra [ja, jb] = abc jc. assuming the nondegenerate character
of matrix aai we can treat the polar decomposition as uniquely invertible transformation from conguration variables
aai to a new set of six lagrange coordinates qij and three coordinates i. the conventional representation of the
elements of the so(3) group allows to interpret the euler angles (1, 2, 3) as pure gauge degrees of freedom. the
transformation (2.14) induces a point canonical transformation linear in the new canonical momenta and the new
canonical momenta (pi := pi , pik) can be obtained using the generating function

f4(e; , q) =

eaiaai(, q) = tr(cid:0)o()qet(cid:1)

the eld strength eai in terms of these new canonical pairs reads

eai = oak()lki (pa, pij ; , q)

where the symmetric part of 3  3 matrix lij is equal to the new momenta pij

pij =

while its antisymmetric part is

thus the nal expression for the eld strength eai in terms of the new canonical variables is

after the reformulation of the theory in terms of these variables one can easily achieve the abelianization of
secondary gauss law constraints and thus by straightforward projection reduce theory to the physical phase space
without any constraints. using the representations (2.14) and (2.23) one can convince oneself that the variables qij
and pij make no contribution to the secondary constraints (2.12)

(2.30)

(2.31)

(2.33)

after having rewritten the model in this form, the construction of the unconstrained hamiltonian system is as follows.
in all expressions we put pa = 0. in particular, in terms of the physical electric eld strength eai

the physical unconstrained hamiltonian h phys

may be written as

and pab in terms of new variables. we decompose the nondegenerate symmetric matrix q as

in order to achieve our nal goal we perform a canonical transformation expressing the physical coordinates qab

q = rt (1, 2, 3)d r(1, 2, 3)

(2.34)

with the so(3) matrix r parameterized by the three euler angles i := (1, 2, 3) and the diagonal matrix d =
diag (x1, x2, x3) . the corresponding canonical conjugate momenta (pi, pi ) can be found by using the generating
function

as

f [xi, i; p ] = tr (qp ) = tr (cid:0)rt ()d(x)r()p(cid:1)

(a , b) = tr(a , b) = ab ,

(a , b) = tr(a , b) = 2ab ,

(a , b) = tr(a , b) = 0 .

the original physical momenta pik can then be expressed in terms of the new canonical variables as

note that the potential term in (2.46) has a symmetry beyond the cyclic one. this fact allows us to write

v (x1, x2, x3) in the form

v (x1, x2, x3) = aa ,

a = 1, 2, 3

(2.47)

with superpotential  = x1x2x3 and a :=

.

this completes our reduction of the spatially homogeneous constrained yang-mills system to the equivalent un-
constrained system describing the dynamics of the physical dynamical degrees of freedom. we see that the reduced
hamiltonian h phys
y mm is exactly the hamiltonian of euler-calogero-moser system of type id3, i.e. is of inverse-square
interacting 3-particle system with internal degrees of freedom and related to the root system of simple lie algebra d3
[7,8] embedded in a fourth order external potential represented in superpotential form.

iii. euler-calogero-moser system as a free motion on space of symmetric

matrices

in order to establish the relation between yang-mills mechanics and euler-calogero-moser system let us consider
the hamiltonian system with the phase space spanned by n  n symmetric matrices x and p with noncanonical
symplectic form

5

and hamiltonian dened as

{xab, pcd} =

(acbd  adbc) .

h =

(3.1)

(3.2)

(3.3)

this system is the spin generalization of the calogero-moser model and is known as euler-calogero-moser model [6].
particles are described by their coordinates xi and momenta pi together with internal degrees of freedom of angular
momentum type lij = lji. the nonvanishing poisson brackets are

{xi, pj} = ij
1
{lab, lcd} =
2

(aclbd  adlbc + bdlac  bclad) ,

(3.4)

(3.5)

the analogous model has been introduced earlier in [5] where the internal degrees of freedom satisfy the following
poisson brackets relations

{lab, lcd} = bclad  adlcb .

(3.6)

for the general elliptic version of euler-calogero-moser system the action-angle type variables have been constructed
and the equations of motion have been solved in terms of riemannian theta-functions [20]. the canonical symplectic
form of this model are represented in terms of algebra-geometric data [21] using the general construction of krichever
and phong [22].

to nd the specic set of coordinates in which the hamiltonian (3.2) coincides with euler-calogero-moser hamil-

tonian (3.3) let us introduce new variables

x = o1()q(q)o() ,

(3.7)

where the matrix orthogonal matrix o(q) is parameterized by n (n 1)
),
elements, e.g. euler angles (1, ,  n (n 1)
q = diagkq1, , qnk is a diagonal matrix. this point transformations induces the canonical one which we can obtain
using the generating function

using the representation

(ij , kl) = tr(ij kl) = 2ikjl ,
(a, ij) = tr(aij) = 0

one can nd that pa = pa and components pab represent via the o(n ) right invariant vectors elds lab

from this it is clear that the hamiltonian (3.2) coincides with the euler-calogero-moser hamiltonian (3.3).

(3.14)

(3.15)

derived with the help of hamiltonian (3.2) gives the solution of euler-calogero-moser hamiltonian system as follows.
for x-coordinates we need to compute the eigenvalues of matrix x = x(0) + p (0)t while the orthogonal matrix o
which diagonalizes x determines the time evolution of internal variables.

iv. relation between yang-mills mechanics and euler-calogero-moser system

in this section we shall demonstrate how su(2) yang mills mechanics arises from the higher dimensional matrix
model after projection on certain invariant submanifold determined by the discreet symmetries. let us consider the
classical hamiltonian system of n particles on a line with internal degrees of freedom embedded in external eld with
potential v (x1, x2, . . . , xn ) and describing by the hamiltonian

h =

(xi  xj )2 + v (x1, x2, . . . , xn ) .

(4.1)

the particles are described by their coordinates xi and momenta pi together with the internal degrees of freedom of
angular momentum type lij = lji. the nonvanishing poisson brackets are

{xi, pj} = ij
{lab, lcd} = aclbd  adlbc + bdlac  bclad ,

we choose the potential in the following form

v (x1, x2, . . . , xn ) = detxtr(x 2) .

one can see that this potential can be represented as

where the superpotential is

v (x1, x2, . . . , xn ) =

n

xi=1

iw iw ,

w = idetx .

bellow we treat the internal degrees of freedom entering in the hamiltonian (4.1) in the form

lab = yab  yba

(4.2)
(4.3)

(4.4)

(4.5)

(4.6)

(4.7)

where internal variables ya and a combine the canonical pairs with the canonical symplectic form. the hamiltonian
(4.1) has the following discrete symmetries [19]:

 parity p

 permutation symmetry m

(cid:18) xi
pi (cid:19) 7(cid:18) xi

pi (cid:19) ,

(cid:18) yi

m(i) (cid:19)
(cid:18) yi
i (cid:19) 7(cid:18) ym(i)

7

(4.8)

(4.9)

where m is the element of permutation group sn . the submanifold of phase space dened as

xa + xn a+1 = 0 ,
pa + pn a+1 = 0 ,
ya + yn a+1 = 0 ,
a + n a+1 = 0 .

is invariant under the action of the symmetry group z = d(z) where

and m is specied as

d = p  m

m (a) = n  a + 1 .

(4.10)
(4.11)
(4.12)
(4.13)

(4.14)

(4.15)

in order to project to the manifold described by constraints (4.10)-(4.13) we use the dirac method to deal with the
second class constraints. let us introduce the dirac brackets between the arbitrary functions f and g of all variables
(xa, pa, ya, a) as

{f , g}d = {f , g}  {f , za}{za , zb}1{zb , g}
where za denote all second class constraints za := (a, a, a, a), a = 1, , n

a =

a =

(pa + pn a+1) ,

a =

(ya + yn a+1) ,

(a + n a+1) ,

with the canonical algebra

{a, b} = {a, b} = {a, b} = { a, b} = 0 ,
{a, b} = ab ,
{ a, b} = ab .

thus the fundamental dirac brackets are

{xa, pb}d =
{ya, b}d =

(4.16)

(4.17)

(4.18)

(4.19)
(4.20)
(4.21)

(4.22)

(4.23)

after the introduction these new brackets one can treat all constraints in the strong sense. letting the constraints

function (4.10)-(4.13) to vanish the system with hamiltonian (4.1) reduces to the following system

which coincides with the hamiltonian of su (2) yang-mills mechanics for n = 6.
in the derivation we take into
account that due to the restriction of superpotential (4.6) to the constraint shell (4.10)-(4.13) the potential term
reduces to the potential of yang-mills mechanics

v. lax pair representation for yang-mills mechanics in zero coupling limit

the conventional perturbative scheme of non-abelian gauge theories starts with zero approximation of free particle
motion. in this section we state the solution of the corresponding zero coupling limit in yang-mills mechanics in the
form of lax representation. the relation between (4.1) and (4.24) allows to construct the lax pair for the free part
of the hamiltonian (4.24) (g = 0) using the known lax pair for euler-calogero-moser system (4.1) without external
potential term (g = 0).

according to the results work of s.wojciechowski [6] the lax pair for the system with hamiltonian
