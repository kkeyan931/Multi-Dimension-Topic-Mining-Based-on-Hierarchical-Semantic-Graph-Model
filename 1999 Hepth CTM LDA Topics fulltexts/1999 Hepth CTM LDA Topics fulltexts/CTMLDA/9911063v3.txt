abstract

a formula describing nite renormalizations is derived in the epstein-glaser formalism
and an explicit calculation of nite counterterms in 4-theory is performed. the zimmer-
mann identities and the action principle for changes of parameters in the interaction are
presented independent of the adiabatic limit.

1 introduction

renormalization is an old art of removing divergences which occur unavoidably in qft. in
course of time many calculational techniques, more or less mathematical, were developed.
usually the more mathematical formulations of renormalization were too abstract for prac-
tical purposes, like the epstein glaser approach [epgl1] of renormalization. apart from the
work of scharf [scha] and stora [post] [sto] nothing was done in this framework for a long
time. nevertheless a further development of the epstein glaser method is worth wile, be-
cause it turned out that this method is best suited for the construction of theories on curved
space times [brfr] [d ufr]. its advantages are the local character and the formulation in
position space.
another more abstract formulation of renormalization theory is the bphz- renormaliza-
tion. in this framework some fundamental results of the structure of renormalization were
achieved, namely the forest formula and the action principle. the latter describes how
greens functions change by a variation of parameters in a theory. in the derivation of the
action principle lowenstein [low] used the gell-mann-low formula to express greens func-
tions in terms of free elds. in this context the action principle is a consequence of simple
properties of free eld insertions into the s-matrix. in the present work we call these proper-
ties action principle, because they describe the underlying basic structure and can be proved
independently of the adiabatic limit. this is justied by the fact that the gell-mann-low
formula is valid in epstein-glaser renormalization in the adiabatic limit, if this limit can be
performed. therefore in the adiabatic limit our action principle indeed describes via the gell-
mann-low formula the dependence of greens functions on parameters of the theory. d utsch
and fredenhagen [d ufr2] give another derivation of the action principle. in contrast to our
derivation they use insertions into time ordered products (t -products) of interacting elds.
using the fact that interacting elds are up to a factor insertions in the s-matrix one can

1

transform the two formulations into each other. in their comparison with the usual action
principle they only consider variations of the interacting part of the lagrangian with mass
dimension 4. in this case their action principles coincides with the usual one in the adiabatic
limit. breitenlohner and maison [brma] succeeded in formulating the action principle also
in dimensional renormalization.
in this work we will give a formulation of nite renormalizations in the epstein glaser ap-
proach corresponding to the forest formula. furthermore we give a formulation of t -products
and insertions in the epstein glaser formalism so that the derivation of the part of the action
principle concerning changes in the interaction is analogous to that of lowenstein [low]. to
ll the gap between the theoretical formulation and practical calculations we demonstrate
how to renormalize the s-matrix in 4-theory up to the third order.
many calculations concerning renormalization can be found in the book of zavialov [zav].
often they are similar to the results presented here, but they are not formulated in the
sense of distributions. especially the structure of the renormalization presented in [zav]
corresponds to the formulas given in the theorems (6.1) and (6.2).
to make this work selfcontained, we sometimes repeat some results of other articles in a form
tting to our calculations. we hope it is helpful for the reader to get a better understanding
of the method.
this work is divided into ve sections. in the rst one we briey repeat the basics of causal
perturbation theory in the framework of the wightman axioms.
in the next section we present a mathematical description of the time ordered product. the
inductive construction of epstein and glaser [epgl1] is described. the main result of this
section is the description of nite renormalizations by a family of functions n.
section 4 prepares the calculations of section 5 and contains a short summary of [scha]
[epgl1] [fre] [brfr]. after some microlocal analysis we see that renormalization is noth-
ing else than an extension of distributions on an appropriate space of test functions. we
repeat the lorentz invariant form of the extension presented in [brpipr] which is used in the
calculations and discuss some properties of the w -operator.
in section 5 we show how renormalization of the s-matrix of 4-theory works up to the third
order. in the results we only list the terms surviving in the adiabatic limit, but the calculation
can be performed without using the existence of this limit. in contrast to other renormaliza-
tions in momentum space the complexity grows not with the number of loops but of vertices in
a diagram. thus the second order calculation is simple because subdivergences rst appear
in the third order calculation. to come back to the abstract formulation of the epstein glaser
approach we list the normalization conditions for a scalar theory. some of them are an ab-
stract form of the rules used in the calculations. with the gell-mann-low formula we derive
the dyson schwinger equations (dse) from the normalization condition n4 in 4-theory.
in the next section we derive the action principle for variations of parameters in the inter-
action analogously to [low]. the rst subsection is based on the theorem of perturbative
renormalization theory [post]. using the form of nite renormalizations of section 2 we are
able to determine the counterterms in the lagrangian compensating a change of renormal-
ization explicitly. then we dene insertions into t -products and show that they have some
of the properties of the insertions of [low]. relations between insertions of different degrees
are described by the zimmermann identities [zim], that are formulated in the framework of
epstein glaser renormalization. finally we prove the formulation of the part of the action
principle concerning changes in the interaction in terms of insertions in the s-matrix inde-
pendent of the adiabatic limit. the action principle for changes in the parameters of the free
lagrangian turns out to be more complicated, so we postpone it.
these results and the missing part of the action principle allow a derivation of the renor-
malization group equations (rge) as in [low]. the rge and the dse are also valid outside
perturbation theory. they provide for an important tool for nonperturbative constructions
and methods, see for example [zin] and [sti]. the action principle is used in algebraic renor-

2

malization [piso], which leads to a systematic renormalization of the standard model of elec-
troweak interaction to all orders of perturbation theory [kra]. this work is a rst step of a
translation of these methods into the epstein glaser formulation of renormalization.
we always use the manifold r4 with the minkowski metric for spacetime. with the work of
[fre], [brfrko], [brfr], [rad] it should be easy to formulate the arguments on curved space
times, often one only has to replace r4 by an arbitrary lorentz manifold m.

2 causal perturbation theory and epstein glaser

renormalization

a mathematical precise formulation of a qft was given by g arding and wightman [wiga].
they treat a qft as a tupel

(h, u, , d, |0i)

(1)

of a separable hilbert space h, a unitary representation of the restricted poincare group
p 
+, eld operators , a dense subspace d of h and the vacuum vector |0i. the tupel has
to fulll the wightman axioms [stwi]. among others they state that the elds  are local
operatorvalued distributions, welldened on the dense domain d of the hilbert space. d
contains the vacuum. in the construction of the s-matrix it is sufcient to regard the dense
domain d0  d  h, generated by all vectors which can be constructed by applying a nite
set of eld operators to the vacuum:

d0 = {  h|  h(f1) . . . (fn)|0i, n  ni}.

(2)

therefore any formulation of perturbation theory has to take into account the distributional
character of the elds and interaction terms, and it has to make sure that the operators are
well dened on d (or in the case of the s-matrix on d0). causal perturbation theory is in
the sense of these axioms, because it has all those properties. it was founded by the work of
stueckelberg [stu], bogoliubov and shirkov [bosh]. in their formulation every interaction
term is accompanied by a test function

g  s(cid:0)r4(cid:1) ,

g : r4  [0, 1]

(3)

which switches the interaction on and off at different space time points (s is the schwartz
space of testfunctions). g vanishes at innity and therefore provides for a cutoff for long
range interactions. all quantities of the causal construction are formal power series in this
function, especially the s-matrix is constructed with the following ansatz:

s (g) = 1 +

in

n!z d4x1 . . .z d4xn sn (x1, . . . , xn) g (x1) . . . g (xn) .

xn=1

(4)

the coefcients sn are operatorvalued distributions, smeared with the switching function
g(x), such that each term in the sum is a welldened operator on d0.
epstein and glaser [epgl1] have found that the sn can be determined by a few physical
properties of the s-matrix, namely

1. translation covariance

3

2. lorentz covariance

3. unitarity

4. causality

and the renormalization conditions. actually for the inductive construction of the sn proposed
by epstein and glaser only causality is important. to prove that the resulting s(g) is a
welldened operator on d0 they apply wicks theorem and need translation covariance. in
[brfr] it is shown how translation covariance can be substituted by a condition on the wave
front sets of the sn. this makes the method work on curved space times, too. the other
properties are realized by the normalization conditions.
with some calculations, the properties above are transfered to the following properties of the
coefcients sn:

1. translation covariance: sn (x + a) = u (a) sn (x) u 1 (a).

2. lorentz covariance: sn (x) = u (0, ) sn(x)u 1 (0, ).

3. in the following, we will often work with sets of indices. we will denote with j =
{1, . . . , n} the full set of indices and with i any subset of j . for i = {i1, . . . , ik} we use
the notation

sk (xj|j  i) := sk (xi1 , . . . , xik ) .

from the unitarity condition the following equation is obtained:

sk (xi|i  i) s+

nk (xj|j  j \ i) = 0.

xij

|i|=k

4. causality of the s-matrix yields the factorization property:

sn (x1, . . . , xn) = si (x1, . . . , xi) sni (xi+1, . . . , xn)

(5)

(6)

(7)

for {x1, . . . , xi} & {xi+1, . . . , xn}, where x & y means that y does not lie in the forward
light cone of x.

this property implies the locality of the sn:
[sn (x1, . . . , xn) , sm (y1, . . . , ym)] = 0 if all the xi are spacelike to the yj.

the factorization property (7) is used to identify the coefcients sn with timeordered prod-
ucts. if we further demand s1 = lint the higher sn can be constructed inductively [epgl1].
this is described in the next section.
from the s-matrix the interacting elds can be obtained by the following formula of bogoli-
ubov [bosh]:

they are formal power series in the switching function g like the s-matrix. to get rid of
this function at the end of the construction the adiabatic limit g(x)  1 has to be performed.

.

(8)

g(h) =

d
d

s1(g)s(g + h)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)=0

this limit bears some problems, because all infrared divergences appear which were avoided
in the local formulation. by denition the adiabatic limit exists in the weak sense if all
greens functions exist in the sense of tempered distributions for g  1 choosing suitable
normalizations. if it is further shown that for g  1 the s-matrix is a unitary operator one
says that the adiabatic limit exists in the strong sense. the adiabatic limit is constructed
by choosing a sequence of functions gn with limn gn = 1, one has to be careful because
sometimes the result depends on the choice of the gn.
the weak adiabatic limit was proved to exist for massive theories [epgl1], qed and massless
 : 2n : theories [blse]. the existence of the adiabatic limit in the strong sense has only been
proved for massive theories [epgl2].

3 the time ordered product

for a precise mathematical formulation, the t -products introduced in this section are not
dened as usual on wick monomials of quantized elds. this idea was introduced in [boa].
let a be a commutative algebra generated by the so called classical symbolical elds i and
their derivatives. they are called symbols, because there is no relation like the klein-gordon
equation, so that the elds and their derivatives are linearly independent. we regard

d(cid:0)r4, a(cid:1)  f =xi

gi(x)i

(9)

where the sum is a nite sum over elements i of the algebra a. an element f is given by its
coefcients gi  c
the time ordered product (t -product) is a family of maps tn, n  n, called tn-products. they

0 (r4).

into the operators on h with the following properties:

are functions from(cid:0)d(cid:0)r4, a(cid:1)(cid:1)n

1. t0 = 1

 f  d(cid:0)r4, a(cid:1) ,

where the sum is over all generators of a. each local eld is the image of an element

t1 (f ) =pi : i(gi) :
f  d(cid:0)r4, a(cid:1) under t1. we dene the t -products such that tn (g(d)) = tn ((dtg)) is
t1(cid:0)g2 + gm2(cid:1) =: (cid:0)(cid:0)2 + m2(cid:1) g(cid:1) := 0.

fullled for derivatives d up to the second order. t1 is not injective, because the wick
products obey the wave equation. for example, in a free scalar theory we obtain

2. symmetry in the arguments:

tn (f1, . . . , fn) = tn (f1, . . . , fn)

   sn

where sn is the set of all permutations of n elements.

 fi  d(cid:0)r4, a(cid:1) , i = 1, . . . n,

(10)

3. the factorization property:

tn (f1, . . . , fn) = ti (f1, . . . , fi) tni (fi+1, . . . , fn)

(11)

if suppf1  . . .  suppfi & suppfi+1  . . .  suppfn and fi  d(cid:0)r4, a(cid:1)  i.

5

we remark that the tn are multilinear functionals in the arguments fi, for instance
t2(f1 + f2, f3) = t2(f1, f3) + t2(f2, f3). therefore it sufces to know their values for one kind
of interaction term f (polarization identity), and we can omit the indices of the f .
we now want to construct higher tn-products with the help of the factorization identity as
expressions of lower tn-products. this is possible if ij suppfi =  with j = {1, . . . , n}, in
other words, the total diagonal

dn = {(x1, . . . , xn)  r4n|x1 = x2 = . . . xn}

(12)

is not in the support of the tensorproduct of the fi. in the calculations this is achieved by
multiplication of the distribution with a causal partition of unity:

denition 3.1 a causal partition of unity in r4n \ dn is a set of c-functions
p(n)
i

: r4n \ dn  r with the following properties:

1. suppp(n)

i  {(x1, . . . , xn)  r4n \ dn | xi & xj i  i, j  i c}

2. p i(j

i6=

p(n)
i

= 1.

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)r4n\dn

since suppf1  . . .  fn is contained in a compact region, suppf1  . . .  fn  c i is contained
in a compact region, where c i = {(x1, . . . , xn)  r4n| xi & xj i  i, j  i c}.
in this
region the part p(n)
p(n)
property as follows:

of the partition of unity can be written as a nite sum of factorized terms
i,k(xn). then a t -product is constructed according to the factorization

i,k(x1). . . pn

(13)

the last step in this construction of epstein and glaser [epgl1] is the extension of the right
hand side of (13), if the support of the tensor product of the fi contains the total diagonal dn.
we call this shortly the extension of the t -product to the total diagonal. this extension is not
unique, so there are several t -products differing from another by nite renormalizations. in
renormalization theory this corresponds to the free choice of the renormalization constants.
now we can describe the structure of nite renormalizations with the following theorem,
which arose from discussions with k. fredenhagen: (it can be seen as the precise formulation
of a formula given by [bosh])

theorem 3.1 let t, t be two different t -products.

d(cid:0)r4n, an(cid:1)  d(cid:0)r4, a(cid:1) with supp n  dn and
t|p |hooip

tn(cid:16)njj fj(cid:17) = xp p art(j)

then there are functions n

:

|oi|(cid:16)njoi

fj(cid:17)i.

(14)

for the interpretation of the operatorvalued distribution n we go back to equation (13).
the lower t -products on the right hand side of (13) consist themselves of products of lower
t -products which were extended to a subdiagonal of r4n. we call the extension to these
subdiagonals the renormalization of subdivergences and the extension to the total diagonal
in the last step the renormalization of the supercial divergence.

6

fixing the extensions of all tn-products to the diagonals denes us a special t -product. the
distribution n = t 1
(n) is the difference of t and t in the renormalization of the su-
percial degree of divergence of (13), having all subdivergences renormalized according to
t .
proof: we construct the n inductively by the following formula:

1

n

:= tn(cid:16)njj fj(cid:17)  xp p art(j)
= t1(cid:16)n(cid:16)njj fj(cid:17)(cid:17) .

|p |>1

t|p |hooip

|oi|(cid:16)njoi

fj(cid:17)i

(15)

to show that this construction makes sense, we prove by induction over n that the support

of n is contained in dn. since t1 is surjective, there is a n(cid:16)nj fj(cid:17)  d(r4, a) with

t1(n) = n. equation (14) is automatically fullled by this construction. now we show by
induction that supp( n)  dn.
beginning of the induction:

 |n| = 1:

 |n| = 2:

1(f ) = t1(f )
2 (f1, f2) = t2 (f1, f2)  t2 (1(f1)1(f2)) = t2 (f1, f2)  t2 (f1, f2) ,

and we saw in (13) that two t2-products are equal outside the diagonal. so supp 2  d2.

now we assume n

i=1suppfi =  and have to show n (f1 . . . fn) = 0. we obtain with (13):

tn(cid:16)njj fj(cid:17) =xijxk

t|i c|(cid:16)nji c pj

i,kfj(cid:17) t|i|(cid:16)qji pj

i,kfj(cid:17)

(16)

with the induction hypothesis (supp m  dm for all m < n) we also obtain a factorization of
the second term of n

|p |>1

(since the support of the |oi| is contained in a set of points belonging to a partition i  j
with oi  i or oi  i c). therefore we obtain

|j|(cid:16)njj fj(cid:17) =
= xijxk (cid:26) t|i c|(cid:16)nji cpj

4 renormalization as an extension of distributions

4.1 motivation

in this section we show that the extension of numerical distributions corresponds to renor-
malization. we derive some properties of our extension procedure, compare it with the usual
way of renormalization in momentum space and apply it explicitly in the next section to the
renormalization of the second and third order of the s-matrix in 4-theory, namely:

s(2) (g) =

s(3) (g) = 

1

1

4!(cid:19)2
2(cid:18) i
2(cid:18) i
4!(cid:19)2
t2(cid:0)g(x1)4, g(x2)4(cid:1) =
4!(cid:19)3
3!(cid:18) i
t3(cid:0)g(x1)4, g(x2)4, g(x3)4(cid:1) = 

t2(cid:0)(g4)2(cid:1)
3!(cid:18) i
4!(cid:19)3

1

1

(19)

(20)

t3(cid:0)(g4)3(cid:1) .

by means of wicks theorem the tn-products appearing in the expansion of the s-matrix can
be transformed into integrals of linear combinations of products of numerical distributions
with wick products. for instance t2 in s(2) (g) has the form:

t 0

2(cid:0)g(x1)4g(x2)4(cid:1)

=

with

t0(x1, x2)

x16=x2=

k (cid:19)(cid:18) 4

k (cid:19) (4  k)! 

4xk=0(cid:18) 4
z d4x1z d4x2 t0(x1, x2) : k (x1) k (x2) : g(x1)g(x2). (21)

(if (x1  x2))4k .

from theorem 0 of [epgl1] we know that the product of a welldened translation invariant
numerical distribution with a wick product is welldened on d0. therefore we only have to
take care of the numerical distributions, denoted with t0 in the following. in renormaliza-
tion theory, t0 is for noncoincident points a product of feynman propagators, therefore it is
poincare invariant in minkowski space. problems arise from the fact that feynman propaga-
tors are distributions and the product of distributions is not always dened. the domain of
denition depends on the singularities of the individual factors, characterized by methods of
the microlocal analysis.

4.2 some microlocal analysis

the content of this subsection can be found in [brfrko] [hor] [fre]. let m = r4n or m  r4n
be a manifold of dimension 4n and d(m) all c-functions on m with compact support. the
singular support of a distribution u  d(m), sing supp u, is dened as the set of all points in
m without any open neighbourhood to which the restriction of u is a c function.
if a distribution v with compact support has no singularities, its fourier transform v is asymp-
totically bounded for large  by

|v () |  cn (1 + ||)n

 n  n,   r4n,

(22)

where cn are constants for each n . any distribution u  d(m) is regular in y  m, if for
all functions f  c
0 (y ) the fourier transform of f u is asymptotically bounded for large  by

|cf u () |  cn (1 + ||)n

8

 n  n,   r4n,

(23)

where cn are constants for each n . with sing supp u we denote the set of points of m where
u is not regular.
let u be singular at x  x  m, x  sing supp u. x  r4n \ 0 is the set of all  of the
cotangent space t 
0 (x) with f (x) 6= 0
in a conic neighbourhood v of . x is a cone describing the direction of the high frequencies
causing the singularities at x. the pair of x and x is an element of the wave front set:

x (x) such that (23) is not fullled for any function f  c

denition 4.1 if u  d (m), then the closed subset of m (cid:0)r4n \ {0}(cid:1)  t (m), dened by

w f (u) =(cid:8)(x, )  m (cid:0)r4n \ {0}(cid:1) |   x (u)(cid:9)

is called the wave front set of u. the projection on m is sing supp u.

(24)

multiplication with a smooth function a  c and differentiation do not enlarge the wave
front set:

w f (au)  w f (u) ,
w f (du)  w f (u) .

(25)

(26)

for the existence of the pointwise product of two distributions u, v at x it is sufcient to fulll
the condition

(x, 0) / w f (u)  w f (v) = {(x, 1 + 2)|(x, 1)  w f (u) , (x, 2)  w f (v)} .

(27)

thus the product at x exists, if u or v or both are regular in x. if u and v are singular at x,
the product exists, if the second components in the wave front sets of u and v at x cannot be
added to the zerovector. if the product exists, its wave front set will fulll

w f (uv)  w f (u)  w f (v)  (w f (u)  w f (v)) .

we now check if the products of feynman propagators of scalar elds appearing in (21),

(if (x1  x2))n

with n = 2, 3, 4

(28)

(29)

exist for all x1  x2. since if (x1  x2) is for x1 6= x2 a solution of the klein-gordon equation,
its singular support is contained in the characteristic set of the klein-gordon operator, the
forward and backward lightcone.
the wave front set set of the feynman propagator has the following form:

w f (f ) = {(x1, k; x2, k)  t 
x1

r4  t 
x2

{(x1, k; x1, k), k 6= 0}.

r4(cid:12)(cid:12) (x1, k)  (x2, k), k  v +



if x1  j +


(x2)}

(30)

is the closed forward respectively backward light cone and j +


here v +
(x2) are all points in

m in the future respectively past of x2 which can be connected with x2 by a causal curve .
(x1, k)  (x2, m) means that x1 and x2 can be connected by a light cone with cotangent vectors
k and m at x1 and x2.
the sum of the second components of the wave front sets of two propagators can vanish only

at x1 = x2. therefore the products (29) are dened on(cid:0)r4(cid:1)2

\ d2.

9

with (28) we are also able to investigate higher products of feynman propagators occuring
in higher orders of the s-matrix. for instance we discuss the wave front set of the numerical
distribution

t = (if (x1  x2))2

(if (x2  x3))2

(if (x1  x3))

.

(31)

which occurs in our third order calculation of the s-matrix in 4-theory.

the wave front sets in the rst line of (32) yield problems for x3 6= x2 = x1 (in w f (u)) and
for x2 = x3 6= x1 (in w f (v)), the ill-denedness of the product on this subset is treated in the
renormalization of subdivergences. the remaining sums of wave front sets can contain a zero
component for x1 = x2 = x3. this ill-denedness of the numerical distribution is called the
supercial divergence.

4.3 power counting of divergences

in momentum space calculations the ill denedness of products of feynman propagators cor-
responds to uv divergences of loop integrals. divergent terms can be found by counting the
powers of momenta in the loop integrals (power counting). the supercial degree of diver-
gence of a diagram corresponds in position space to the singular order at the total diagonal of
the numerical distribution belonging to this diagram. we rst introduce the denition of the
scaling degree of a distribution:

denition 4.2 the scaling degree of a numerical distribution t  d(r4n) at the origin is
dened by

sd(t) := infn(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)lim

0

the singular order is now given by

t (x1, . . . , xn) = 0 in the sense of distributionso .

(33)

denition 4.3 the singular order of a numerical distribution t  d(rnd) at the origin is
dened by

sing ord t = [sd(t)]  nd

(34)

where d is the space time dimension.

there exist different denitions of the scaling degree in the literature. the denition above
is the steinmann scaling degree [ste]. the singular order of a distribution with respect to
this scaling degree is not larger than the supercial degree of divergence obtained by power
counting in momentum space [brfr]. in [brfr] is also given a denition of a scaling degree
of a distribution with respect to a submanifold, called microlocal scaling degree. with this
microlocal scaling degree we determine all scaling degrees of the numerical distributions in
our calculations, especially we obtain

10

sd(cid:16)(if (x1  x2))4k(cid:17) = 8  2k,

which can be also obtained by using (33).
at x1 = x2 the products of feynman propagators have the singular order

sing ord(cid:16)(if (x1  x2))4k(cid:17) = 4  2k.

for the distribution t in (31) we obtain sd(t) = 10 at x1 = x2 = x3 whereas at x1 = x2 6= x3
and at x2 = x3 6= x1 we have sd(t) = 4 and at x2 6= x1 = x3 it holds sd(t) = 2.
the singular order of the supercial divergence is 2, the singular orders corresponding to the
subdivergences are 0 and -2.

4.4 extension of distributions

in momentum space integrals of diagrams with negative degree of divergence are nite in
euclidean calculations. to give also divergent diagrams a sense one has to renormalize them,
and this procedure is not unique. correspondingly we have the following two theorems in
position space, which are proved in [brfr] on curved space times. the rst one states that
the extension of a distribution of negative singular order exists and is unique. the proof can
be already found in [fre]:

theorem 4.1 if t0 (x1, . . . , xn)  d(cid:0)r4n \ 0(cid:1) has singular order  < 0 at the origin, then a
unique t (x1, . . . , xn)  d(cid:0)r4n(cid:1) exists with the same singular order at 0 and

t0 () = t ()

   d(cid:0)r4n \ 0(cid:1) .

distributions with zero or positive singular order  can be extended, but the extension is not
unique. we rst remark that they are only dened on test functions vanishing sufciently
fast at 0:

 = (1, . . . , n) with ||  } .

t0  d

for all multiindices

theorem 4.2 for all t0 (x1, . . . , xn)  d

numerical distributions t  d(cid:0)r4n(cid:1) with the same singular order  at 0 and

(cid:0)r4n(cid:1) with sing ord t0 = , 0   < , at 0 exist

t0 () = t ()

   d(cid:0)r4n(cid:1) .

in [brfr] this is proved on curved space times.
to construct extensions of distributions with positive singular order, a projection operator on
testfunctions is used.

w (k) is a modied taylor subtraction operator in k variables of the testfunctions. since the
function w has compact support, the result is a function with compact support, and vanishes
up to the order  at 0. therefore the singular distribution t0 (x) with singular order  is
dened on all w (n) (, w, x)  (x) with x = (x1, . . . xn). for k < n the operator w (k) is used in
the renormalization of subdivergences.
the following construction of the (supercial) extension of a numerical distribution t0,
welldened outside the origin, with sing ord t0 =  fullls (40):

< t(x), (x) > = < t0(x), w (n) (, w, x) (x) > +

+ x||

(1)||c

!

< (x), (x) > .

(41)

the free constants c express the ambiguity in the extension of the distribution, which re-
mains after the function w(x) in the w -operator is xed, it holds

< t, wx >= c

for ||  .

(42)

the form of the c can be further restricted by demanding the invariance of the distribution
t under symmetry operations, the lorentz invariance for instance. the most simple choice
of the c would be c = 0. but we will see that this choice is incompatible with lorentz
invariance for || > 1. another choice of the c leads to the form of bphz subtraction at
momentum q in momentum space. the explicit form of these c is given in [scha]. naturally
this choice of the c for q 6= 0 is again incompatible with the lorentz invariance for || > 1.
in the following we will restrict ourselves to the treatment of extensions of the form (41).

4.5 the lorentz invariant extension in scalar theories

it is possible to determine the free constants c of an extension, so that the result is a lorentz
invariant distribution. in [brpipr] the main idea of the calculation is introduced and an
explicit result is obtained for scalar distributions in one variable. a further development of
the techniques yields an inductive formula for a lorentz invariant extension of an arbitrary
distribution [pra]. in our calculations of the second and third order of the s-matrix in 4-
theory we only need the results of [brpipr], which are repeated here. we use the notation

b(1)...(n)

(43)

b(1...n) =

this result is unique up to lorentz invariant terms. choosing the coefcients according to
(46) the remaining freedom in the renormalization procedure is the choice of the function
w and these lorentz-invariant counterterms. in the following we set all counterterms not
depending on w equal to 0, so only the contributions of (46) are nonvanishing. in the calcu-
lations of the next section we need the coefcients c() for || = 0 and || = 2. in the case
|| = 0 all choices of c are lorentz invariant, and we set c = 0. for || = 2 we have

c(12) = 

1

4dt0, x1 x2 xw  x2x(1 2)we .

in 4-theory we want to renormalize diagrams with 2 and 4 external legs. therefore we have
sing ord t  2, and in this case we obtain by partial integration

c(12) = 

1

4d(2 x2x1)t0  x1 x2 xt0, we .

the numerical distributions are products of feynman propagators and depend only on x2:

therefore we have

t0 = 2x(t0)

c12 = (cid:10)x1 x2 t0, w(cid:11) 
= (cid:28)t0, (x1 x2

(49)

(50)

in the following calculations only terms even in the variables contribute. since only the
support of the function w is important, we can assume without loss of generality that the
function is even, too. it follows that the lorentz invariant extension of a distribution of
singular order 2 according to (41) has the form

ht, i = (cid:28)t0, (x)  w(x)(0) 

w(x)

8

x22(0)(cid:29) .

4.6 properties of the w -operator

1. as a projection operator, w (k) has the following properties:

w (k)2 = w (k).
for n  l  m,   , the following relation holds:

w (l) (, w, (x1, . . . , xl)) w (m) (, w, (x1, . . . , xm))  (x1, . . . , xn) =
w (m) (, w, (x1, . . . , xm))  (x1, . . . , xn) .

(52)

2. the renormalization scale

characteristic for every renormalization procedure is the occurence of a mass scale,
the renormalization scale. in the extension of the t -products the w -operation depends
on a function w(x). since the argument of this function should be dimensionless, it
depends implicitly on a mass scale: w = w(mx). the shape of the function w describes
the subtraction procedure, in the region of w = 1 the subtraction is the full taylor
subtraction, whereas nothing is subtracted outside the support of w.

varying the mass scale m with xed w, we change the support region of the function
w and regulate in this way the subtraction procedure. in the limit m  0 we have
w(mx)  1 and the taylor subtraction acts everywhere, whereas in the limit m   the
support of w(mx) shrinks to the origin and we subtract only at this point.

in the following, we continue to write w(x), and only if we need the dependence on the
mass scale, we will write this function as w(mx).

a variation of the mass scale yields

w((m + m)z)  w(mz) = m


m

w(mz) = mzw.

5 renormalization of the s-matrix in 4-theory

5.1 introduction

in this section the second and third order of the s-matrix in 4-theory are renormalized using
the formalism developped in the previous section. already in second order we will see that
the operators n of theorem (3.1) consist only of linear combinations of :  :, : 2 : and
: 4 :. in third order we demonstrate an explicit calculation of a diagram with subdivergences
to make clear how the subtraction works and that the result is indeed independent of the
partition of unity used in the inductive construction. the result of the calculations is given
in the adiabatic limit, otherwise there would be many additional terms.
before starting the calculations it is useful to make some remarks. we will have to work with
expressions of the typical form

z duz dx t0(u) (w (, w, u) a(x, u)g(x, u)) ,

(54)

where t0(u) is the numerical distribution with singular order , g is a testfunction with com-
pact support and a is a wick product of elds at x and u. with u and x we denote a tupel
of coordinates (u1, . . . un) resp. (x1, . . . xn). we always assume that the function w(u) of the
w -operation is even in all components of u
i for all i. in the calculations we use the following
facts:

14

1. if the distributions t0 are even in all u
will vanish due to the integration over u.

i , all odd terms in the taylor subtraction of w

2. to make the extension lorentz invariant, we use the form (46) respectively (51) of the
subtraction. here again the contributions of the coefcients c with || odd vanish, if t0
is even in the u
i .

3. for   1 there appear terms with derivatives of g in the taylor subtraction. these
terms vanish in the adiabatic limit. because the limit exists in massive 4-theory in
the strong sense, we omit them from the beginning.

4. in [d ut] it is shown that the adiabatic limit of vacuum diagrams only exists for a special
choice of the c. this choice is lorentz invariant, and the contributions of the vacuum
diagrams vanish in the adiabatic limit, too.

we denote with ()r the extension of a numerical distribution and with ()e the extension of a
tm-product to the total diagonal dm.

5.2 renormalization of the second order

the second order term in the s-matrix has the form

s(2) (g) =

= 

1

2

t2(cid:0)g(x1)4, g(x2)4(cid:1)
4xk=0(cid:18) 4

k (cid:19)(cid:18) 4

k (cid:19) (4  k)! 

: k (x1) k (x2) : g (x1) g (x2) .

(55)

with the singular orders (36) of the feynman propagators we obtain nontrivial contributions
of the extension from terms with k = 0, 1, 2.

1. k = 0 yields a vacuum diagram. its contribution vanishes in the adiabatic limit.

2. for k = 1 we have

(k=1) (g) =

w(u) : 2(v) : g2(v)

h: 2(u + v)2(v) : g(u + v)g(v)  w(u) : 4(v) : g2(v)i.

(56)

(57)

remark: the individual terms in the square brackets are not dened, only their sum is
convergent and welldened. the result depends on the function w(x). we use this dependence
to read off the form of the nite renormalizations 2: if we choose another lorentz -invariant
t -product with extensions of the form (41) in which all nonvanishing coefcients c depend
on w(x), only the function w(x) will differ. the difference of two w-functions has no support
at 0 and gives a welldened contribution. denoting with t the renormalization at the scale
m + m and with t the renormalization at m we obtain with (53):

2 = (cid:16)s(2)

t (cid:17) =

(58)

(59)

at this stage we are able to see how the theoretically predicted form of the higher n is re-
alized in the calculations. n is the difference in the supercial renormalization of diagrams
with four and two external legs. diagrams with four external legs are supercial logarithmic
divergent and of the form

z duz dv t0(v, u)w (0, w, u) :  (l1(u, v))  (l2(u, v))  (l3(u, v))  (l4(u, v)) :

g (l5(u, v)) . . . g (ln+4(u, v))

(60)

where u = (u1, . . . , un1) are the difference variables and li, i = 1, . . . , n + 4 are linear combi-
nations of v and the ui of the form li(v, u) = v + aiui with ai  r. varying the mass scale in w
we obtain only the following contribution

z dv c(n) : 4(v) : gn(v).

diagrams with two external legs are quadratic divergent and of the form

z duz dv t0(v, u)w (2, w, u) :  (l1(u, v))  (l2(u, v)) : g (l3(u, v)) . . . g (ln+2(u, v)) .

varying the mass scale in the w -operation yields the following contributions:

z dv(cid:16)a(n) : 2(v) : +b

(n) : (v)2(v)(cid:17) gn(v).

by partial integration we obtain the contribution

(61)

(62)

(63)

16

z dv b(n) : (v)(v) : gn(v)

(64)

because the contributions with derivatives of g vanish in the adiabatic limit. finite renormal-
izations to all orders in 4-theory consist only of shifts in the coupling constant, in masslike
terms and kinetic terms of lint, whose coefcients a(n), b(n) and c(n) have to be determined
in the calculations.

5.3 renormalization of the third order

the third order term in the s-matrix has the form

s3(g) =

i3

3!(4!)3 t3(cid:0)g(x1)4, g(x2)4, g(x3)4(cid:1)

and with the structure (13) of the higher t -products we obtain

there are two kinds of w -operations in the calculation, namely taylor subtractions in one
and two variables corresponding to the renormalization of supercial divergences and subdi-
vergences. in the subtraction in one variable u we use the testfunction w(u) as before. the
testfunction of the w -operator in two variables u and v is chosen to be w(u) w(v) w(u + v),
where w is a testfunction in one variable. since u and v are difference variables, the function
is symmetric in all coordinates.
we now list the 14 topological different diagrams occuring in the sum with their values of
i, j1 and j2. furthermore the singular orders of the whole diagram (x1, x2, x3) and of the
subdiagrams, (xi, xj) consisting only of the vertices xi and xj are listed. n is the number of
all different diagrams in the sum with the same topological structure.

the contributions of the diagrams 1 and 7 vanish in the adiabatic limit.
diagrams 2, 3 and 4 are supercial logarithmic divergent, they have four external legs and
contribute to the renormalization of the coupling constant. diagram 5 and 6 have two exter-
nal lines and are therefore supercial quartic divergent. they yield contributions to the mass
and eld strength renormalization. all the other diagrams are supercially convergent, they
do not depend on w and yield no contribution to 3. here we only demonstrate the calculation
of

ables u = x2  x1, v = x1  x3 and apply the operator w (2)(2, w, v, u + v) to the wick-monomial
and the test functions. because of remark 3 (before the calculations) the derivatives in the
subtraction act only on the wick-monomial depending only on one variable u + v. in this case
w (2) has the form of a subtraction operator in one variable given by (51).

the renormalized diagrams 1-5 and 7-11 are given in the appendix a.
now it becomes clear that the independence of the partition of unity proved in [brfr] is a
consequence of the fact that the taylor subtractions of the subdivergences act on the partition
of unity. in the explicit calculation we see that not only the t -products as a whole as shown in
[brfr] but also the contributions to the individual diagrams are independent of the partition
of unity.

5.4 the normalization conditions

we have seen how renormalization works in the epstein glaser formalism in 4-theory. to
come back to a more theoretical formulation we present the normalization conditions for
4-theory. some of them are an abstract formulation of techniques used in the previous cal-
culations. in contrast to the calculations of the previous section the following conditions are
independent of the adiabatic limit. the normalization conditions, introduced in [d ufr] and
extended in [boa], restrict the ambiguities in the renormalization. we repeat these conditions
in the more simple form tting to 4-theory:

 condition n1 demands the lorentz covariance of the t -products, it is described in

[brpipr] and [pra] how to realize it in the extension procedure.

 condition n2 gives the form of the adjoint of t on d and makes sure that the s-matrix

is unitary:

tn(f1, . . . fn)+ = xp p artj

(1)|p |+nypp

tn(cid:0)f +

i , i  p(cid:1) ,

where the sum is over the ordered partitions of j .

 it is shown in [boa] that condition n3 is equivalent to the wick expansion of the time-

ordered products. the wick expansion has the form

tn(cid:0)g1l1 , . . . , gnln(cid:1) = z dx1 . . .z dxn x0k1 ,... ,kn

li!

ki!(li  ki)!

nyi=1

each contribution to the sum in (72) corresponds to a diagram with 1

lines andpi(li  ki) external lines. condition n3 reads

2pi ki internal

for all fi containing only elds and their rst derivatives with

(xk) =z d4y 11(xk  y)g(y)

(74)

where 11(y  xk) is the commutatorfunction i11(y  xk) = [: (y) :, : (xk) :].

the derivative of f is implicitly dened by n3 for n = 1 for all f  d(cid:0)r4, a(cid:1) containing

only linear combinations of elds and their rst derivatives. we obtain




(gn(y)n) = ngn(y)n1,




(g(y)) = 0.

(75)

21

by demanding

tn(cid:0)f1, . . . , fn, g(z)(2 + m2)(cid:1) = tn(cid:0)f1, . . . , fn, ((2z + m2)g(z))(cid:1)

we can extend condition n3 to t -products containing one factor (2 + m2).

 condition n4 has the form

tn+1(cid:0)f1, . . . , fn, (cid:0)2y + m2(cid:1) g(y)(cid:1) = i

tn(cid:18)f1, . . . , g

(76)

(77)

where the fi  d(cid:0)r4, a(cid:1) contain only combinations of elds and their rst derivatives.

we now show that in 4-theory the dyson schwinger equations are a consequence of
n4. with the gell mann low formula the greens functions gi (x1, . . . xn) have the form

d0(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)t (x1) . . . (xi)p

n=0

in

4(y1) . . . 4(yn)g(y1) . . . g(yn)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) 0e

n!r dy1 . . .r dyn(cid:0) 
4!(cid:1)n

so we obtain with n4 and (75)

g(z)

gi+2 (x1, . . . xi1, z, z, z)#

(79)

and these are the dyson schwinger equations [riv]. with gi+2 (x1, . . . xi1, z, z, z) we
mean the vacuum expectation value of the eldproduct (x1)  . . . (xi1)3(z).

6 topics around the action principle

6.1 main theorem of perturbative renormalization theory

the procedure of renormalization depends on the renormalization scale, and we can say that
two t -products t and t are renormalizations at different scales m, although their scale de-
pendence is not obvious in the abstract formulation of section 3. given two renormalization
prescriptions t and t belonging to different scales m one can pass from one to another by a
suitable change of the scale dependent quantities in the lagrangian. this is the content of the
main theorem of perturbative renormalization theory, which is proved in [post] in the frame-
work of causal perturbation theory. popineau and stora give a construction of the changes of
parameters which is, due to the inductive form, not suited for calculations in higher orders.
in this section we derive the explicit form of the changes of parameters in the lagrangian
compensating a change of renormalization t  t , which corresponds to the structure of
renormalization given in [zav]. in the following calculations we use the abbreviations

22

f

:= g(x)4

t ek(f )

:=

xn=k

(i)n

n!

tn(cid:16)fn n(cid:17) .

then the s-matrix reads, for example,

s = t e0(f ) =

xn=0

(i)n

n!

tn(cid:16)fn n(cid:17) ,

and

ek(f ) =

xn=k

(i)n

n!

n(cid:16)fn n(cid:17) .

(80)

the following theorem describes how to absorb a change in the renormalization prescription
t  t in a change f  fr of the physical parameters in the lagrangian:
theorem 6.1 an s-matrix renormalized according to t can be expressed by an s-matrix
renormalized according to t in the following way:

t e0(f ) = t e0(e1(f )) =: t e0(fr).

(81)

remark: because of t e0(f ) = 1 + t (f ) + t e2(f ) and e1(f ) = f + e2(f ) we can derive
from (81) the following recursion relation:

t e2(f ) = t e2(f )  t e2(f + e2(f )).

proof: we prove the theorem in the following calculation:

t e0(f ) =

xn=0

(i)n

n!

t(cid:0)f n(cid:1) (14)

=

xn=0

(i)n

n! xp p art(j)

t ooip

(cid:16)f |oi|(cid:17)! .

(82)

(83)

here we sum over all partitions of the set j = {1, . . . , n}. now we take a xed partition p
and denote with ni the number of elements o of p with |o| = i.

then the relation n =pk

i=1 ini is true with k  n. there are

n!

n1! . . . nk!1!n1 . . . k!nk

(84)

(85)

different partitions p with the same numbers ni. therefore we have

t e0(v) =

xn=0

(i)n

n! xp ini=n

n!

n1! . . . nk!1!n1 . . . k!nk

tn(cid:20)((f ))n1 . . .(cid:16)k(fn k)(cid:17)nk(cid:21)

and obtain

t e0(f ) = lim

nk!k!nk (cid:16)k(fn k(cid:17)nk(cid:21) = t (e0 (e1(f )))

(cid:4) (86)

23

in renormalizable theories, fr = e1(f ) consists only of linear combinations of the eld com-
binations in the original lagrangian. in scalar 4 -theory e1(f ) is a linear combination of
the monomials , 2 and 4. the coefcients depend on the renormalization conditions
and this dependence is described by the callan-symanzik equations and the renormalization
group equations. the most elegant way to derive them uses the action principle [low]. in
the formalism of epstein and glaser the partition of the lagrangian into a free and an in-
teracting part is important. the free part of the lagrangian denes the hilbert space, elds
and their masses of the free theory. it is not clear that a contribution of a massterm to the
interacting lagrangian e1(f ) can be interpreted as a shift in the mass, the result of the
action principle is that concerning the s-matrix it can be interpreted as a massterm.

6.2 insertions

to derive the action principle we need the notion of an insertion.

denition 6.1 an insertion of degree a of an element g  d(cid:0)r4, a(cid:1) into a t -product is dened

by

i (a)(cid:16)g, tn(cid:16)njj fj(cid:17)(cid:17) := tn+1(cid:16)njj fj  g(a)(cid:17) .

(87)

where g(a) means that the vertex belonging to g is treated in the extension procedure dening
tn+1 as a vertex of mass dimension a.

remark: if the degree a of the insertion corresponds to its physical mass dimension m it is
called a soft insertion. in the case a > m all diagrams containing the vertex of the insertion
are oversubtracted and we have a hard insertion. the relation of two insertions of the same
wick monomial with different degrees is given by the zimmermann identities derived in the
next section.
the behaviour of an insertion into the s-matrix under a change of renormalization is given
by the following theorem.

theorem 6.2 an insertion in the s-matrix renormalized according to t can be expressed as
an insertion in the s-matrix renormalized according to t in the following way:

i (a)(cid:16)g, t e0(f )(cid:17) = i (a) ((ge0(f )), t e0(fr))

i (a) (gr(f ), t e0(fr)) .

=:

(88)

remark: analogously to (82) we obtain after some calculation the recursion relation

t (ge1(f )) = i (a)(cid:16)g, t e1(f )(cid:17)  i (a) (g, t e1(fr))  i (a) ((ge1(f )), t e1(fr)) .

proof: we know from theorem (6.1)

t e0(h) = t e0(e1(h)).

(89)

let a be the degree of the insertion g,  a parameter and h = f + g such that the vertex g is
treated in the subtraction procedure of the t -products as a vertex of massdimension a. then
we can interchange in the following calculation differentiation and integration:

24

i (a)(cid:16)g, t e0(f )(cid:17) = i

(89)
= i






t e0(h)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)=0

t ( e0 (e1(f + g))|=0)

= i (a) (g(e0(f )), t e0(e1(f ))) .(cid:4)

(90)

the following properties of insertions are interesting:

 interacting elds have up to a factor s1 the form of an insertion:

z d4xaintl(x) =



h(x)

st (l)1st (l + ha)|h=0

= st (l)1i (a, st (l)) .

(91)

 insertions in the s-matrix of monomials fj occuring in the interaction act as counting
operators of vertices of the kind fj. the proof is analogously to the one given in [low]:
the form of the s-matrix of a theory with interaction vertices f1, . . . fn of mass dimen-
sions a1, . . . an,

st = t e0(cid:16)f (a1)

 zimmermann identities

the zimmermann identities [zim] are relations of insertions of different degrees. com-
paring the two insertions

i (a)(cid:16)g, t(cid:16)njj fj(cid:17)(cid:17) = t(cid:16)njj fj  g(cid:17) ,
i (b)(cid:16)g, t(cid:16)njj fj(cid:17)(cid:17) = t (cid:16)njj fj  g(cid:17)

25

(95)

we obtain the operatorvalued distribution  mediating between the two t -products.
using the properties

 (fi) = fi,
 (g) = g,

 oij

fi! = 0 for |j| > 1

we obtain with (14) the zimmermann identities

t  g oij

fi! = t g oij

fi! + xok j

in the special case of insertions in the s-matrix this formula simplies to

(96)

(97)

i (b) (g, t e0(f ))

(88)
= i (a) ((ge0(f )), t (e0(f ))
= i (a) (g, t e0(f )) + i (a) ((ge1(f )), t e0(f )) .

(98)

 the action principle

the action principle describes the effects of a change of parameters of a theory [sib].
lowenstein [low] has formulated it in terms of insertions into the s-matrix, and we
follow his derivation. in the adiabatic limit it can be transformed with the gell-mann-
low formula into the usual formulation in greens functions.

according to the main theorem (6.1) a change of the renormalization t can be absorbed
by nite counterterms shifting the quantities in the lagrangian. therefore we can
assume without loss of generality that the t -product is xed. a change of a parameter
p  p+p can cause changes in the free lagrangian l0  l0 +l0 and in the interaction
part of the lagrangian:f  f + f . the action principle states that a change of the s-
matrix caused by a variation of a parameter p can be expressed by an insertion in the
s-matrix. we only regard the case where only the interaction part f depends on the
parameter p. in this case the t -product is independent of p and we obtain by a trivial
differentiation the rst part of the action principle:


p

t (e0(f )) = i (4)(cid:18) f

p

, t e0(f )(cid:19) .

(99)

7 summary and outlook

we have derived the structure of nite renormalizations in the epstein glaser formalism.
the form of the s-matrix after a nite renormalization and the zimmermann identities fol-
low from this result. we showed that in 4 theory the dyson schwinger equations are a
consequence of n4.

26

furthermore we have performed the renormalization of the s-matrix in 4-theory up to third
order. the result depends on the testfunction w used in the renormalization, and nite coun-
terterms can be read off. comparing this procedure with other renormalizations in momen-
tum space, we can say that epstein glaser renormalization is better suited for the treatment
of diagrams with few vertices and many loops, whereas momentum space renormalization
has advantages in the renormalization of diagrams with many vertices and few loops.
finally we dened insertions into t -products. the part of the action principle concerning
changes in the interaction is formulated in the epstein glaser formalism independent of the
adiabatic limit.
there are still many open questions: the other part of the action principle has to be derived
and a fully translation of the derivation of the callan symanzik equations as in [low] has to
be worked out. an interpretation of changes of masses has to be found in the epstein glaser
framework. one has to check further if there appear problems in the translation of these
methods on curved space times.
