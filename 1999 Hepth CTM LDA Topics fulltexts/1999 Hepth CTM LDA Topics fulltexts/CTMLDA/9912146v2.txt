abstract

exploiting virasoro constraints on the eective nite-volume partition function, we derive gen-
eralized leutwyler-smilga spectral sum rules of the dirac operator to high order. by introducing
nv fermion species of equal masses, we next use the virasoro constraints to compute two (low-mass
and large-mass) expansions of the partially quenched chiral condensate through the replica method
of letting nv  0. the low-mass expansion can only be pushed to a certain nite order due to de
wit-t hooft poles, but the large-mass expansion can be carried through to arbitrarily high order.
results agree exactly with earlier results obtained through both random matrix theory and the
supersymmetric method.

introduction

the exact spectral sum rules for the dirac operator in nite-volume gauge theories derived by
leutwyler and smilga [1] and later by smilga and verbaarschot [2] have sparked a huge activity
in the eld. it has turned out that there is an exact relation between universality classes in ran-
dom matrix theories and the three main ways in which chiral symmetry can break spontaneously,
depending on the gauge group and the representation of the fermion elds [3, 4, 5]. the random
matrix theory formulation brings a completely dierent set of techniques into play, and much has
been learned from this approach. one of the main eorts recently has nevertheless been to see how all
the results obtained from random matrix theory can be derived directly from the eective partition
function. one of the rst steps in this direction was a set of very compact relations that expressed
microscopic spectral correlators (including the microscopic spectral density itself) directly in terms of
eective partition functions with additional quark species [6]. more recently, many of these results
have been derived directly from the eective eld theory [7]. the idea has been to compute the (par-
tially) quenched chiral condensate and higher chiral susceptibilities through an appropriately extended
eective lagrangian, and from this derive the microscopic spectral correlators. as the technique of
ref. [7] makes use of additional quark species, of which half are bosonic and the others are fermionic,
this extends the avor symmetry to a super lie group at intermediate steps. for this reason it is
commonly known as the supersymmetric method (although it, as applied, has nothing to do with
space-time supersymmetry).

the purpose of this paper is to explore another technique that can be used to derive the partially
quenched chiral condensate. this is based on the so-called replica method1 in which one extends the
theory with nv additional fermionic species, and takes the limit nv  0 at the end of the calculation.
the replica method is known in other contexts to be often problematical [8] (see however also the
recent discussion on this issue [9]), but we shall nd no fundamental diculties with this technique in
the present context.

let us rst outline how the replica method can be used to compute partially quenched averages in
qcd. consider the qcd partition function with nf physical quark elds and nv additional quark
elds of degenerate masses mv. we restrict ourselves to gauge eld sectors of xed topological charge
, which we for simplicity from now on take to be non-negative:

(1.1)

where the determinants are taken over non-zero modes only. this can be considered as an average
over gauge elds (and physical fermions, here already integrated out) of nv identical replicas of the
fermionic partition function

in condensed matter physics this (unnormalized) average is conventionally denoted by a bar:

(nf +nv)


z

(1.4)

the subscript v will throughout denote valence, and the additional quarks are thus valence quarks,
a terminology borrowed from lattice gauge theory. obviously, if we let nv = 0 we simply recover the
original qcd partition function. for nf + nv not too large, the theory is presumed to undergo, in the
chiral limit of massless quarks, spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking according to the usual pattern
su(nf + nv)su(nf + nv)  su(nf + nv). taking the limit nv  0 must therefore incorporate
some kind of analytic continuation in n of the lie group su(n).

for any xed nv we can compute observables in the extended theory by viewing the partition function
as the generating function of the n-point functions of . we shall here focus on just the chiral
condensate itself, and only on the chiral condensate of the additional fermionic copies. as we will take
nv  0, this becomes the partially quenched condensate in the theory with nf physical fermions. we
dene this partially quenched (mass-dependent) chiral condensate by

and similarly v  mvv . treating nv as a parameter that is not restricted to be integer (which is
permitted by the representation of the partition function in eq. (1.1)), we can make a taylor expansion

the partially quenched chiral condensate is a particularly convenient quantity for lattice gauge theory
simulations, and comparisons with theory have already been made both in the topologically trivial
sector [10] and, very recently, in sectors of non-vanishing topological charge  [11]. we note here
that higher-order partially quenched chiral susceptibilities, which are also readily studied by monte
carlo simulations, can be derived in a completely analogous manner. for a chiral k-point function one
simply needs to introduce nv1, . . . , nvk sets of dierent additional species (each of nvith degenerate
masses vi), and take the combined limit of all nvi  0 in the end, after having performed the required
dierentiations.

in this paper we will show how the replica method can be applied to the eective nite-volume partition
function, and in this way we shall derive analytical series expansions for the partially quenched chiral
condensate. as a by-product of the analysis we will get, for free, generalized leutwyler-smilga sum
rules to very high order. the plan of the paper is as follows.
in the next section we review the
technique for deriving high-order expansions of the eective partition function on the basis of an
iterative sequence of partition function constraints. from this expansion we immediately derive a long
list of generalized spectral sum rules of the dirac operator. in section 3 we turn to the replica method,
where we rst exploit the same partition function constraints to derive a small-mass expansion for the

partially quenched chiral condensate. we also show how a dierent set of partition function constraints
can be used to derive a very high order expansion in large masses. in section 4 we point out that the
usual leutwyler-smilga spectral sum rules, which by denition are taken with respect to the massless
theory, have a natural generalization where the spectral sums are taken with respect to the theory with
massive fermions. we derive a series of such massive spectral sum rules, perturbatively expanded in
the physical masses. in section 5 we discuss some generalizations to dierent patterns of spontaneous
chiral symmetry breaking, and point out why the present series expansions cannot be used to derive
the microscopic spectral density of the dirac operator itself.
in section 6 we briey list the main
conclusions.

2 spectral sum rules from virasoro constraints

spectral sum rules of the dirac operator are derived by comparing the full qcd partition function
with the eective low-energy partition function. in the large-volume scaling region v  1/m4
, this
eective partition function is to leading order [1]

where m is the quark mass matrix rescaled by the space-time volume v times the value  of the
chiral condensate in the chiral limit (and at  = 0). we will in fact always take this to be diagonal
of entries i = miv . in this section we shall restrict ourselves to nf (physical) fermions with no
additional quark species, and nv will thus here be taken to be zero from the very beginning. the
integration in eq. (2.1) is over the coset of chiral symmetry breaking, here extended from su(nf ) to
u(nf ) due to the projection on a sector of xed topological charge . the integral is known in closed
form [12],

where the nf  nf matrix a is given by

(2.4)

although the eective partition function is known explicitly, eq. (2.2) is not in a form suitable for the
derivation of spectral sum rules of the dirac operator. to get it into such a form, it is convenient to
start with the case  = 0. in that case the left and right invariance of the haar measure under unitary
transformations shows that the partition function depends only on the combination mm. a crucial
observation of ref.
[13, 14] is that the partition function in fact satises an innite set of constraint
equations that can be used to determine it uniquely. the precise form of these constraints depend on
the chosen variables, and one can use two dierent sets:

(2.6)

which is a suitable set for large-mass expansions (the coecients in front have been inserted for later
convenience). spectral sum rules of the dirac operator are derived by means of a small-mass expansion,
and we shall therefore begin with the description in terms of the variables3 t+

where k({k})  pi ki. the singular parts will play an important role in what follows. originally

noted by de wit and t hooft in the context of strong-coupling expansions in lattice gauge theory [15],
these poles are in fact innocuous as far as the expansion of the partition function itself is concerned
[16]. what happens is that for (integer and non-vanishing!) values of n the poles only occur in
terms that are linearly dependent, and therefore should be combined. after combining them, all poles
cancel. this phenomenon becomes obvious when we consider the explicit expansion below.

the coecients cnf ({k}) have already been computed recursively in ref. [14] to high order, enough
to determine the partition function to 8th order in the masses. the restriction to the  = 0 sector can
easily be lifted due to avor-topology duality, which states that

we have checked that this expansion is correct to the order given by expanding, for xed nf , the closed
expression (2.2) up to that order. (note that it is not at all simple to rearrange the closed expression
(2.2) in terms of an expansion in just powers of traces of the mass matrix; the rearrangements are
dierent for each value of nf ). in this expansion we directly verify the cancellation of de wit-t hooft
poles for any of the nite, integer, values involved.

with this high-order expansion of the eective partition function, we can now easily derive a long
series of spectral sum rules, following the method of leutwyler and smilga [1]. because the method is
described in detail in ref. [1], we shall not give details of how these sum rules are extracted, but only
quote the results. we rescale as usual the eigenvalues i of the dirac operator according to i  iv .
expanding the original partition function (1.1) around the massless theory, and comparing with the
above expansion up to 8th order, we then nd:

of these, the relations (2.14), (2.15) and (2.18) have been derived previously [1] (see also ref. [17]). we
note that the dewitt hooft poles make these sum rules divergent for an increasingly larger number
of integer n -values. this is due to infrared divergences near   0. just as these poles cancel among
dierent terms in the small-mass expansion, one can form analogous combinations of sum rules that
are infrared nite. for example, the de wit-t hooft poles at n = 1 associated with the terms of
order 4 in eq. (2.13) cancel by combining the third and fourth terms in that expansion. this directly
translates into a cancellation between two eigenvalue sum rules from our list:

is nite (this is 6 times the o(1/6) contribution to the partition function). a similar phenomenon
persists to all orders.

the massless spectral sum rules (2.14)-(2.24) can of course be compared with the chiral random
matrix theory result. this is done by averaging the inverse moments according to the universal

3 the partially quenched chiral condensate

let us now extend the eective theory with nv valence quark elds. we are interested in obtaining the
partially quenched chiral condensate, not higher order susceptibilities, and therefore take the valence
quark masses as degenerate and of size v = mvv . as mentioned above, the extended partition
function is also the generating functional for the n-point functions of  (quenched or unquenched);
the partially quenched chiral condensate is obtained through the replica method. since the partition
function for  = 0 only depends on mm and the valence quarks have degenerate masses it is natural
to introduce a mass matrix of the physical quarks m so that

in short, for the denition of the partially quenched chiral condensate we can take

the subscript on  refers to the topological sector, as usual. as we have seen above, it is not
particularly helpful to know the exact analytical expression for the (extended) eective partition
function z
if one wishes to derive spectral sum rules for the dirac operator. there a small-
mass expansion is required by denition. as for nding the partially quenched chiral condensate using
the expression (3.30), no expansion in either large or small masses is required in principle. however,
the closed analytical formula (2.2) is unfortunately not directly suitable from our point of view. this
is because the nv-dependence enters in a quite non-trivial way through the size of the matrix whose
determinant needs to be taken. because there is no simple extension of the analytical expression (2.2)
outside integer values of nv, we restrict ourselves here to series expansions. we shall in fact be able
to carry such expansions through in both the large-mass and small-mass regions.

3.1 the small-mass expansion

we begin with the small-mass expansion, because here we already have the needed expansion at hand
(see eq.
(2.13)). our rst observation is that nv enters in a manner that allows for an analytic
continuation once we make use of eq. (3.29). we can thus proceed with the replica method.

inserting the expansion (2.13) into (3.30) we obtain the partially quenched chiral condensate to 7th
order in the masses (truncating the expansion at this order is a matter of choice; we do it because
it corresponds to consistently expanding both in the valence quark mass v and the physical fermion
masses i to the same order):

where n = nf +  (since the nv  0 limit has already been taken). note that the topological term
/v comes out trivially from the (detm) -factor in front, as it should.
is this expansion correct? there are by now two independent ways to check it: comparing with
random matrix theory, and comparing with the supersymmetric method of partially quenched la-
grangians. before proceeding with such comparisons, let us however rst note an obvious feature of
the above expansion. in contrast to the small-mass expansion of the partition function itself (2.13),
there is clearly not going to be a cancellation of the de wit-t hooft poles in the expansion of the
partially quenched chiral condensate. this may appear surprising, since the chiral condensate is just
determined from the partition function through, for example, a formula like (1.5). if the de wit-t
hooft poles cancel in the partition function, how can they not cancel after taking the v-derivative
and the limit nv  0 as in eq. (1.5)? the answer is simple. to be able to take the quenched limit
of nv  0 we must not cross any singularities that can obstruct the analytical continuation. this
is, however, precisely what happens for those terms in the expansion (3.31) that, for given n , are
singular. to give an example, let us consider the 3
v-term in the expansion (3.31). for simplicity, let
us also consider the case where all physical masses vanish. then there is only one term:

3
v

8n (n 2  1)

.

(3.32)

this term is singular for n = 1 (and, of course, also in the more trivial case of n = 0), and therefore
cannot possibly represent the partially quenched chiral condensate to order 3
v in the n = 1 theory. let
us therefore trace what happens if we set nf +  = 1 from the outset. the only term in the expansion
(2.13) that gives an o(3

v) contribution to (v) in this massless case is (n  nf + nv + )

which precisely in this nf +  = 1 case is not linear in nv. the factor 1/nv in the expression for
the quenched condensate (3.30) will in this case remain uncancelled, and an analytic continuation to
nv = 0 is prohibited by the singularity. the term (3.32) in the expansion (3.31) is therefore incorrect
precisely in the case nf +  = 1 (but it is valid for all nf +  > 1). this holds also for all higher
orders in the expansion. the small-mass expansion for  is thus given to a nite number of terms.
for example, in the massless nf +  = 3 theory we obtain

where the higher-order terms in v cannot be purely power-like. the same phenomenon occurs for
larger integer values of n , where we encounter the singularity at higher orders. we thus conclude that
the small-mass expansion (3.31) is valid up to the rst term where a pole appears. the obstruction
to an all-order expansion of (v,{i}) is from this point of view uncancelled de wit-t hooft poles.
the expansion can of course be pushed to very high orders by considering nf +  suciently large. we
stress again that the expansion is perfectly meaningful up to the order at which the rst uncancelled
de wit-t hooft pole appears, and that it is completely understood why the expansion cannot be
pushed beyond this order. it is not a peculiar and unwanted artifact of the replica method, but a real
feature of the small-mass expansion of the partially quenched chiral condensate.

with this caveat in mind, we can now check the expansion (3.31) against both the supersymmetric
method and results from random matrix theory. for instance, both methods yield a fully quenched
chiral condensate of the form [10, 7]

(v)



= v [i(v)k (v) + i+1(v)k1(v)] +


v

.

(3.35)

where in(x) and kn(x) are modied bessel functions. looking at the small-v expansions of kn(v),
one notices that they are only purely power-like up to order n 2 (after which a logarithmic term must
be included). the small-mass expansion of the closed expression (3.35) therefore cannot possibly match
to all orders the purely power-like expansion that would seem to follow from the small-mass expansion
of the partition function in eq. (2.13). and we nd that the agreement of the two expansions is exact
precisely up to the order at which our small-expansion (3.31) ceases to be valid. the appearance, at
higher orders, of logarithmic terms in the expansion explicitly conrms the statement above: there
is simply no power-law small-mass expansion of the chiral condensate beyond that given order. it is
quite remarkable that the normally cancelling de wit-t hooft poles precisely obstruct the small-mass
expansion at just the right order.

we have also checked that the double-expansions in both v and physical fermion masses i are correct
precisely up to the order at which eq. (3.31) is valid. we have done this by comparing the small-mass
expansions of the partially quenched chiral condensate in the nf = 1 theory with the expansions of
the closed expression

(v, )

which has been derived by the supersymmetric method [7] (and which can also easily been seen to
agree with the random matrix theory result). again we nd perfect agreement with all terms up to
the order at which our expansion (3.31) ceases to be valid, i.e. up to the rst uncancelled de wit-t
hooft pole.

3.2 the large-mass expansion

having succeeded in deriving the low-mass expansion for the partially quenched chiral condensate, we
next turn to the opposite expansion, i.e. for large masses. the advantage of this expansion is that it
can be pushed to arbitrarily high order, for any value of nf .

recall that the eective partition function (2.1) only depends on the combination mm for  = 0.

this combination is hermitian and there are thus only nf degrees of freedom in z

(3.37)

the idea is now to nd suitable partition function constraints that will enable us to solve for the
partition function in an expansion in the variables t
k . this is not completely straightforward, but as
shown rst by gross and newman [13], it is possible to recover a complete set of virasoro constraints
in the variables t
k if one rst extracts a simple prefactor from the partition function. the factorization
is as follows [13] (see also ref. [14] for the generalization to other types of matrix integrals):

(3.38)

the exponential prefactor indicates that an expansion of the partition function entirely in terms of the
t
k s simply is not possible. this is also obvious if we consider the original group integral in a saddle-
point approximation around large m: the leading behaviour is indeed exponentially large. moreover,
one suspects from the form (3.38) which is essentially a saddle-point expansion that the resulting series
expansion we will derive below is at best asymptotic. this is in contrast to the previously considered
small-mass expansion, which we believe is convergent.

one readily veries that these constraints indeed also fulll the commutation relations of classical
virasoro generators (2.9), and thus form a consistent set of constraints. these constraints are also
complete in that they determine the partition function uniquely, given the boundary condition y
=
1 for t
k = 0, i.e. in the limit of innite masses. while these constraint equations were already
established in ref. [13], they have not previously been used to derive a systematic expansion for the
partition function. we do this by copying the procedure of the small-mass expansion. that is, we
expand the unknown function y

we next solve for the coecients ck1,...,kn iteratively. in fact, this is in many ways simpler than in
the small-mass expansion in that we in this case easily can derive closed analytical expressions to all

using this formula, and others similar, it is straightforward to derive very high order expansions for
k }), and therefore also for the partition function itself. for example, to 7th order in the
y
masses we nd a rather formidable-looking expression (that is easily pushed to much higher orders):

in writing (2.6) and (3.37) we have implicitly assumed that mm is invertible. this means that
there must be no zero-eigenvalues in the mass matrix, and we thus by default cannot consider any
number of massless fermions in this large-mass expansion. in particular, the concept of avor-topology
duality, by which a topological charge  is implemented by adding  massless fermions to the  = 0
partition function, cannot be applied in the framework of a large-mass expansion. because the virasoro
constraints (3.39) and (3.40) apply only to the case  = 0 we know of no analogous way to implement
this large-mass expansion outside of the  = 0 sector.

introducing nv mass-degenerate valence quarks into the large-mass expansion of the eective partition
function, and noting that in this case

we again observe that nv can be regarded as a continuous parameter. the replica approach can
therefore again be applied.

4 massive spectral sum rules

the spectral sum rules presented in section 2 concern inverse moments of the dirac eigenvalues aver-
aged with respect to the massless theory. these massless spectral sum rules are, however, only special
cases of massive spectral sum rules obtained by averaging with respect to the massive theory. in fact,
massive spectral sum rules appear quite naturally in lattice simulations. such massive spectral sum
rules are conventionally taken [3, 19] to be of the form

z 

0

d s(;{i})yj

1

( 2 + 2

j )nj

,

for given integer njs. here masses and dirac operator eigenvalues are treated on equal footing in the
denominators. however, we could equally well dene massive spectral sum rules by

*xj >0

1
 2n

j + = z 

0

d

s(;{i})

 2n

,

(4.47)

which are just the usual inverse moments, but evaluated in the massive theory. here and below the
brackets denote the average with respect to the massive and partially quenched theory in a topological
gauge eld sector of charge . in order to derive such massive spectral sum rules we return to the
small-mass expansion of the partially quenched condensate (3.31).

inserting the original partition function (1.1) into the denition (3.30) of the partially quenched chiral
condensate one has

(v,{})

(4.48)

we can now nd a useful general relation between the partially quenched chiral condensate, and
(massive) spectral sum rules. the connection is simple: the sum rules of inverse moments  2n of the
eigenvalues will be convergent up to a given value of n, which we denote by k. let us therefore expand
the denominator of eq. (4.48) in partial fractions up to this maximal value k:

the resulting sum rules are here only given as a perturbative expansion in the physical fermion masses,
in contrast to the massless spectral sum rules which are exact. one notices that trivially the diagonal
massless spectral sum rules (2.14)-(2.17) are reproduced by taking all i = 0. as discussed already in
section 2, the above expansions are valid for n larger than the biggest integer poles. this is completely
understandable from the present point of view, as it corresponds to performing the expansion (4.49)
in partial fractions only up to the point where the spectral sums of all terms still converge. the
non-diagonal massive sum rules can also be calculated within this framework. one simply needs
to break the mass-degeneracy of the valence quarks and consider general partially quenched n-point
correlators of , as discussed in the introduction.

these new massive spectral sum rules can easily be compared with the predictions from random
(nf ,)
(,{i}) in powers
matrix theory. what we need is to expand the microscopic spectral density 
s
of trm 2, and then insert this expansion in

(4.56)

inserting this expansion into (4.55), we nd that the relevant integrals become analytically doable
when  is taken large enough to make the integrals converge. in this way we have explicitly conrmed
a number of terms in the above expansions of the massive spectral sum rules.

5 generalizations and outlook

the small and large mass expansions for the partially quenched chiral condensate can of course in
principle be extended to the two other major universality classes, corresponding to su(2) gauge
group with fermions in the fundamental representation, and su(nc  2) with fermions in the adjoint
representation. the challenge is here to nd a convenient method that permits high-order expansions.
in our present case all simplications arose from the observation that the eective partition function
is annihilated by two sets of virasoro constraints, which in turn is rooted in the fact that this eective
partition function is a  -function of an integrable kp hierarchy. the eective partition functions of
the two other universality classes have not been nearly as well studied, although there are reasons to
believe that they are what is known as pfaan  -functions (see, e.g., ref.
[21]). it may thus be
possible to derive analogous partition function constraints, which will permit high-order expansions
with little labor. in this connection we also make the following observations. the virasoro constraints
(2.8) and (3.41) both follow from the simple dierential equation

(mm) that provide the two conditions.

by changing variables to the pertinent expansion parameters. this dierential equation by itself is
a trivial consequence of the fact that the integration manifold is u(nf + nv), as it just amounts to
inserting the unitarity condition u u = 1 in the integrand of the eective partition function (2.1).
imposing two boundary conditions is thus sucient to determine the partition function uniquely. in
k = 0) = 1, together with the required
the case at hand it is the choice z
property z
except for a change of the proportionality constant, here 1/4, the dierential equation (5.1) also
holds for the eective partition functions of the two other universality classes mentioned above, as
well as for the one of qcd3. it is also instructive to notice that the restriction to a sector of xed
topological charge does not aect the dierential equation. the boundary conditions imposed on the
dierential equation, however, separate the solutions, i.e., the partition functions. for instance, before
the projection onto a xed topological sector the partition function studied here depends on det(m)
and det(m) as well as on mm.
of course we can already at this stage obtain the partially quenched chiral condensates to lowest non-
trivial orders for the two remaining ensembles by simply making use of the same small-mass expansions

15

of the partition function that were used to derive the rst sum rules. this is a trivial exercise: from
ref. [2] we learn that the eective partition function for su(2) gauge group and nf + nv fermions in
the fundamental representation is

z = [pf( m)] 1 +

1

8(2nf + 2nv +   1)

tr m m + . . .! ,

(5.2)

where, now m is an antisymmetric (2nf + 2nv)  (2nf + 2nv) matrix with the usual mass matrices
+m and m placed in the two o-diagonal blocks, and zeros in the two diagonal blocks. using again
eqs. (3.29) and (3.30) we nd the partially quenched chiral condensate to this order:

(v)



=


v

+

v

2(2nf +   1)

+ . . . ,

(5.3)

which one can conrm matches the rst term in the expansion of the result obtained from random
matrix theory (see the rst of ref. [11]). note that this expansion has its rst uncancelled de wit-t
hooft pole at 2nf +  = 1, and the above term in the expansion is thus valid for 2nf +  > 1.

similarly, for the universality class corresponding to nf + nv adjoint fermions and arbitrary gauge
group su(nc) we see from ref. [2] that the partition function expansion is

z = det(m) 1 +

1

2(nf + nv + 2 + 1)

trmm + . . .! ,

(5.4)

where  = nc is an integer. using the present replica method this leads to a partially quenched
chiral condensate of

(v)



=


v

+

v

nf + 2 + 1

+ . . . ,

(5.5)

which one again can check matches the result from random matrix theory [11]. there is no de wit-t
hooft pole in this case, and thus no retriction on the validity of this rst term.

since one can obtain perturbative solutions to the partially quenched chiral condensate in all three
universality classes, a natural question concerns the microscopic spectral density of the dirac operator
s(;{i}). this density is given by the discontinuity of the partially quenched chiral condensate
across the cut on the imaginary axis [7]:

s(;{i}) =

1
2

disc|v =i (v,{i}) =

1
2

lim
0

[(i + ,{i})  (i  ,{i})] .

(5.6)

(this identication holds when one considers (v,{i}) as a function of a real mass v, and then
replaces v  i  ).
it now seems straightforward to insert our small-mass and large-mass se-
ries expansions for (v,{i}), and derive corresponding series expansions for the spectral density
s(;{i}). but this is not possible. let us rst consider the small-mass expansion of eq. (3.31).
as we emphasized in section 3.1, this expansion is valid up to the rst de wit-t hooft pole. except
for the topological term /v which always trivially yields the correct -function contribution to the
microscopic spectral density, this power-series expansion of a nite number of terms has no cut across
the imaginary axis. this may seem surprising, since the microscopic spectral density s(;{i}) does
have a simple and well-dened power-series expansion. the explanation is, however, simple. because
of the de wit-t hooft poles, we can derive the small-mass expansion of (v,{i}) up to (and in-
cluding) order 
. but the perturbatively expanded s(;{i}) (see, e.g. the massless case

2nf +21
v

16

(2.27)) starts only at order  2nf +2+1. the microscopic spectral density is always precisely one step
ahead of the order to which we can push the small-mass expansion of the partially quenched chiral
condensate! in hindsight, a phenomenon like this had to occur, since the pure power series implied by
the small-mass expansion cannot give rise to any discontinuity across the imaginary axis. so the de
wit-t hooft poles in fact precisely save what would otherwise be a paradoxical situation.

the asymptotic large-mass expansion of section 3.2 cannot be used to extract the microscopic spectral
density either. here the reason is very dierent. recall that the asymptotic expansion we have
derived in section 3.2 is suitable v on the positive real axis. for example, for nf = 1 our expansion
simply coincides, up to an irrelevant normalization factor, with the asymptotic expansion of the bessel
function i0():

(5.7)

(nf =1)
0

z

= i0() 

(1)k
(2)k

(k + 1/2)
k!(k + 1/2)

e
2



xk=0

this asymptotic expansion is correct, but it neglects exponentially suppressed terms of order e/
and lower. because of this, the asymptotic expansion (5.7) does not reproduce the asymptotic expan-
sion for j0() after rotation to the imaginary axis (the exponentially suppressed terms then become
of magnitude comparable to those kept in (5.7), and that expansion is therefore no longer correct near
the imaginary axis). we conclude that neither of the two expansions we have considered here are
suitable for deriving the microscopic spectral density.

6 conclusions

using the virasoro constraints on the eective partition function we have obtained small-mass and
large-mass expansions for the qcd partition function valid in the scaling region v  1/m4
. in these
expansions we can treat the number of valence quarks nv as a continuous parameter. this form is
thus suited for a calculation of the partially quenched chiral condensate using the replica method.
two series of spectral sum rules for the qcd dirac operator follow from the small-mass expansion.
one series extends the leutwyler-smilga sum rules in a simple way to very high (here 8th) order, while
the other series is new: it computes the spectral sum rules in the massive theory, and we have given
series expansions in the physical masses for these new sum rules. in all cases we have checked, we
have found complete agreement with earlier results based either on random matrix theory or the
supersymmetric technique. the replica method constitutes a new and independent derivation of these
results.

with the expansions of the partition function at hand we have also derived the small-mass and large-
mass expansions of the partially quenched chiral condensate. in all cases we have checked there is
again complete agreement with earlier analytical predictions based on the two other methods.

we have here restricted ourselves to small-mass and large-mass series solutions only because they
provide the simplest framework in which to employ the replica method. this is not an inherent
restriction, though.
it is thus an open challenge to extend the method beyond these two series
expansions.
