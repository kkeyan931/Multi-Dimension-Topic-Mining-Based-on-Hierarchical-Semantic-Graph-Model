abstract

we investigate the problem of derivation of consistent equations of motion for the massive spin 2
eld interacting with gravity within both eld theory and string theory. in eld theory we derive the
most general classical action with non-minimal couplings in arbitrary spacetime dimension and nd
the most general gravitational background on which this action describes a consistent theory. we
show also that massive spin 2 eld allows in principle consistent description in arbitrary background
if one builds its action in the form of an innite series in the inverse mass square. using sigma-model
 the explicit
description of string theory in background elds we obtain in the lowest order in 
form of eective equations of motion for the massive spin 2 eld interacting with gravity from the
requirement of quantum weyl invariance and demonstrate that they coincide with the general form
of consistent equations derived in eld theory.

string theory contains an innite number of massive elds with various spins interacting with each
other and with a nite number of massless elds and should provide a consistent description of higher
spins interaction. within ordinary eld theory consistent classical actions for the higher spin elds are
known only on specic curved spacetime manifolds. for example, massive integer spins described by
symmetric tensors of corresponding ranks were investigated only in spacetimes of constant curvature
[1][5]2. it means that gravity eld in these descriptions should not be dynamical since it does not feel
the presence of higher spins matter through an energy-momentum tensor. hence a consistent classical
action for gravity and a higher massive eld is not known and there are some indications that it does not
exist at all.

one of these indications comes from considering a kaluza-klein decomposition of einstein gravity
in ddimensional spacetime into gravity plus innite tower of massive second rank tensor elds in
(d  1)dimensional world, masses being proportional to inverse compactication radius. the resulting
four dimensional theory of spin 2 elds interacting with gravity and with each other should be consistent
as we started from the ordinary einstein theory and just consider it on a specic manifold. but as was
shown in [7], it is impossible to reduce this theory consistently to a nite number of spin 2 elds, i.e.
consistency can be achieved only if the innite number of higher massive elds are present in the theory.
from the other hand, there are arguments that in string theory a general coordinate invariant eective
eld action reproducing the correct s-matrix both for massless and massive string states does not exist too
[8]. the full eective action for all string elds is not general coordinate invariant and general covariance
arises only as approximate symmetry in eective action for massless elds once all the massive elds are
integrated out. that eective action for massive elds cannot be covariant follows, for example, from the
fact that terms cubic in massive elds can contain only at metric and there is no terms of higher powers
[8].

though inuence of massive string modes is negligible at low energies it is desirable to understand
how their consistent description in string theory arises. in addition to the general importance of this
problem knowledge of eective equations of motion for massive string modes can be useful in various
applications of string theory, for instance, in pre-big bang cosmology [9].

and indeed, as we show in this paper there exists a possibility to derive from the string theory
covariant equations for massive higher spins elds interacting with background gravity linear in massive
elds. this possibility does not contradict to non-covariance of the full string eld action [8]. terms in
this action cubic in massive elds should really be non-covariant but one can derive in general covariant
form terms quadratic in massive elds. the aim of our paper is to show explicitly how this procedure
works using as an example dynamics of the second rank tensor from the rst massive level of open bosonic
string.

a convenient method of deriving eective eld equations of motion from the string theory is pro-
vided by the model approach [10]. within this approach a string interacting with background elds
is described by a two dimensional eld theory and eective equations of motion arise from the require-
ment of quantum weyl invariance. perturbative derivation of these equations is well suited for massless
string modes because the corresponding two dimensional theory is renormalizable and loop expansion
corresponds to expansion of string eective action in powers of string length .

inclusion of interaction with massive modes [11][13] makes the theory non-renormalizable but this
fact does not represent a problem since in string theory one considers the whole innite set of massive
elds. innite number of counterterms needed for cancellation of divergences generating by a specic
massive eld in classical action leads to renormalization of an innite number of massive elds. the only
property of the theory crucial for possibility of derivation of perturbative information is that number of
massive elds giving contributions to renormalization of the given eld should be nite. as was shown
in [12] string theory does fulll this requirement. to calculate function for any massive eld it is
sucient to nd divergences coming only from a nite number of other massive elds and thus it is
possible to derive perturbatively eective equations of motion for any background elds in any order
in . to nd non-perturbative contribution to the eective equations of motion one should use, for
example, the method of exact renormalization group [14]. but this method has a serious disadvantage
as it requires explicit separation of classical action into free and interaction parts and thus leads to non-
covariant equations for background elds. from the general point of view this fact does not contradict
general properties of string theory but makes it rather dicult to establish relations between string elds
equations and ordinary eld theory.

in this paper we discuss derivation of covariant equations of motion for massive string elds interacting
with gravity by means of ordinary perturbative analysis of quantum weyl invariance condition in the
corresponding model. of course, perturbatively we can obtain equations only linear in massive elds.
it was noted long ago [8] that one can make such a eld redenition in the string eective action that terms
quadratic in massive elds (linear terms in equations of motion) acquire dependence on arbitrary higher
powers of massless elds and so may be covariant. in this paper we receive explicitly these interaction
terms in the lowest in  approximation.

as a model for our calculations we use bosonic open string theory interacting with background elds
of the massless and the rst massive levels. first massive level contains symmetric second rank tensor
which provides the simplest example of massive higher spin eld interacting with gravity. we begin with
analyzing the problem of consistency for this eld interacting with gravity from the point of view of eld
theory. consistency of the theory requires that number of physical propagating degrees of freedom should
be the same as in the at space limit. we obtain the most general form of classical action fullling this
requirement in arbitrary dimension and show that in case of actions quadratic in spacetime derivatives
(i.e. linear in curvature) consistency can be achieved only on gravitational backgrounds with vanishing
traceless part of ricci tensor. if one includes in the action an innite number of terms with all possible
powers of curvature then consistency can be achieved without any restrictions on the background geometry
and this is just the case realized by string theory. in order to obtain equations of motion for the massive
spin 2 eld from the string theory we build eective action for the corresponding two dimensional theory,
perform renormalization of background elds and composite operators and construct the renormalized
operator of energy momentum tensor trace.

this rather standard scheme was rst developed for calculations in closed string theory in massless
background elds [10, 15] and then was generalized for the open string theory [16] and for strings in
massive elds [12].

making perturbative calculations we restrict ourselves to string world sheets with topology of a disk.
the resulting equations of motion for graviton will not contain dependence on massive elds from the

2

open string spectrum because these elds interact only with the boundary of world sheet and can not
inuence the local physics in the bulk. for example, in the case of graviton and massive elds from the
open string spectrum one expects that equations of motion for the graviton would look like ordinary
vacuum einstein equations without matter. one can obtain contributions from open string background
elds to the right hand side of einstein equations for gravity only considering world sheets of higher genus
[17].

the organization of the paper is as follows. first we describe the most general consistent equations of
motion for massive spin 2 eld on curved manifolds from the point of view of ordinary eld theory. then
we describe the string model that we use for derivations of eective equations of motion of string massive
elds. requirement of quantum weyl invariance leads to eective string elds equations of motion and
we show in the lowest order in  that these equations are consistent.

it follows from the analysis of irreducible representations of 4-dimensional poincare group that massive
spin 2 eld in at spacetime can be described by symmetric transverse and traceless tensor of the second
rank h satisfying mass-shell condition:

(cid:16)2  m2(cid:17)h = 0,

h = 0,

h 

 = 0.

(1)

in higher dimensional spacetimes poincare algebras have more than two casimir operators and there are
several dierent spins for d > 4. talking about spin 2 massive eld in arbitrary dimension we will mean,
as usual, that this eld by denition satises the same equations (1) as in d = 4. after dimensional
reduction to d = 4 such a eld will describe massive spin two representation of d = 4 poincare algebra
plus innite tower of kaluza-klein descendants.

it is well known that all the equations (1) can be derived from the fierz-pauli action:

where h =  h .

equations of motion following from the action (2)

e = 2h   2h +  h +  h  h 

 m2h + m2h = 0

  h 



can be used to build d + 1 expressions without second derivatives of h :

e = m2h  m2h = 0
m2
d  2

 e + e = hm4 d  1
d  2

= 0

(2)

(3)

(4)

(5)

these expressions represent constraints on the initial values for the eld h and its rst derivatives.
thus the theory contains the same local dynamical degrees of freedom as the system (1) and describes
traceless and transverse symmetric tensor eld of the second rank.

now if we want to construct a theory of massive spin 2 eld on a curved manifold we should provide
the same number of propagating degrees of freedom as in the at case. it means that one should be able
to build exactly d + 1 constraints from the equations of motion e and in the at spacetime limit these
constraints should reduce to (4,5).

generalizing (2) to curved spacetime we should substitute all derivatives for the covariant ones and
also we can add non-minimal terms containing curvature tensor. as a result, the most general action for
massive spin 2 eld in curved spacetime quadratic in derivatives and consistent with the at limit should
have the form [1]

should contain one vector constraint and one scalar constraint generalizing (4,5) for the case of curved

there are no problems with generalization of the vector constraint (4). it does not contain second

derivatives of h for any gravitational background and for any values of coecients a1, . . . a5:

as for the curved space generalization of the scalar constraint (5), it can have additional terms

proportional to curvature and does contain second derivatives:

where dots stand for the terms without second derivatives of h and we decomposed the curvature
tensor r into weyl tensor c, traceless part of the ricci tensor r = r  1
d g r and scalar
curvature. it is impossible to cancel all second derivatives in (9) by xing the coecients ai since at least
some combination of the last two terms with r will always remain. so in order to achieve consistency
with the at space limit one has to impose restriction on the gravitational background

r =

1
d

g r

(10)

thus cancelling bad terms with second derivatives of h in (9). this restriction is no very strong and
allows one to consider a wide class of curved backgrounds. note, that in all previous works only the
constant curvature d=4 spacetimes were considered. the condition (10) means that only traceless part
of ricci tensor should vanish while scalar curvature and weyl tensor can be arbitrary.

in fact, this condition can be yet more weakened because in order to achieve consistency one should
cancel in (9) only second time derivatives. for example, if we are dealing with a stationary spacetime
possessing a timelike killing vector k, k2 < 0 it is sucient to demand:

which means that only projection of the traceless part of r on orbits of k should vanish.

kkr =

other terms with second derivatives in (9) can be cancelled by choosing appropriate coecients. as
a result, one arrives at one-parameter family of consistent theories for the massive spin-2 elds on the
spacetime fullling (10):

 is the only dimensionless coupling constant responsible for non-minimality of interaction with curved
background. this is the most general form of the action for the massive spin 2 eld in curved spacetime
of arbitrary dimension leading to consistent equations of motion. previous works [1]-[3] treated only cases
with various particular values of  and only for d = 4.

note that consistency of the theory (in the sense that it has correct at limit) cannot be achieved with
minimal coupling to gravity. for any value of  there are non-minimal terms in (11).

the constraints (13,14) have the simplest form when  = 1. the equations of motion in this case

reduce to:

2h + 2r
h 

 = 0,





h  m2h = 0,

h = 0,

(15)

the theory is consistent for any other values of , only explicit form of constraints and dynamical equations
of motion is more complicated than that of (15).

of course, one would like to overcome the restriction (10) on the background gravitational eld and
to construct consistent theory of the massive spin 2 in arbitrary curved spacetime. such a possibility
really exists if one considers a lagrangian which contains an innite number of terms. it is possible only
for massive elds because the mass of the eld h is the only dimensionful parameter which can be used
to construct a lagrangian with terms of arbitrary orders in curvature multiplied by the corresponding
powers of 1/m2:

actions of this kind are expected to arise naturally in string theory where the role of mass parameter
is played by string tension m2 = 1/ and perturbation theory in  gives eective actions of the form

5

(16)3.

possibility of constructing consistent equations for massive higher spin elds as series in curvature was
recently studied in [5] where for spin 2 eld these equations were derived in particular case of symmetrical
einstein spaces in linear in curvature order. in principle, as we argue below consistency can be achieved
without imposing any restrictions on gravitational background, at least in the lowest order in 1/m2.

equations of motion are:

e = 2h  g2h + h + gh  h 

   h 



+ 2a1rh + 2a2g rh + 2a3r





h + a4r

h + a4r

+ a5rh + a5g rh +
+ o(cid:18) 1

m4(cid:19)  m2h + m2hg = 0

1
m2 (rh + rh + rh + rrh)

(17)

now we solve perturbatively the constraints with respect to the trace and longitudinal part of h. of
course, the combinations of equations of motion e forming the constraints can change in higher orders
but this is irrelevant for the lowest order conditions. the vector constraint arise from:

e +

1

m2 (re + re) + o(cid:18) 1

m4(cid:19) = m2h + m2h + o(1) = 0



h  h = o(cid:18) 1

m2(cid:19)



(18)

since the trace enters the equations of motion in the term m2h we will need expansion of the scalar

constraint up to the next to leading terms:

m2
d  2

g e +  e + b1rg e + b2re + o(cid:18) 1
= m4 d  1
+ (d  1)b1 + b2i
d  2

h + m2rhh 2a1 + 2da2 + a5

 b2i + o(1) = 0,

m2(cid:19) =

d  2

(19)

we see that in the lowest orders the expression (19) does not contain second derivatives for any values
of the coecients ai, bi and for arbitrary background. solving it with respect to the trace we get

h =

1
m2 rh

(d  2)b2  2a3  2a4  da5

d  1

+ o(cid:18) 1

m4(cid:19)

(20)

substituting (20) back to the equations of motion we get in the lowest order the system of equations

for h equivalent to the original equations (17):
2h + 2a1rh + (2a3 + 2)r

+ g rh

h + o(cid:18) 1

m2(cid:19) = 0,

(d  2)b2  2a3  2a4  a5
m2(cid:19) = 0.

h + 2(a4  1)r

 m2h + o(cid:18) 1

m2(cid:19) = 0,

(21)

mass shell condition in (21) contains in this order four non-minimal terms with curvature tensor and
coecients at all of them are arbitrary.

this arbitrariness is related to the possibility of making eld redenitions in the action (16). it is well
known [18] that in string theory such possibility allows to change eective action for massless background
elds in higher orders. in case of massive elds action contains the mass term which is of order 1/ and

3in fact, string theory should lead to even more general eective actions than (16) since in the higher  corrections

higher derivatives of the eld h

 should appear.

6

this leads to possibility of changing some coecient in the eective action already in the lowest order.
namely, since (16) contains all higher powers of 1/m2 one can redene the eld h through an innite
series as:

h  h +

1

m2(cid:0)1r



h + 2r



m4(cid:19)
(h) + 3rh + 4g rh(cid:1) + o(cid:18) 1

(22)

using such redenitions one can assign any values to the coecients a1, a3, a4, b2 in (21) and so specic
values of these coecients do not play any role in achieving consistency of the theory (16). requirement
of consistency will restrict parameters of the theory only in higher orders in 1/m2.

we would like to stress once more that the theory (16) admits any gravitational background and so no
inconsistencies arise if one treats gravity as dynamical eld satisfying einstein equations with the energy
- momentum tensor for the eld h . this system is consistent in the sense that it has correct number
of degrees of freedom. one can also study additional requirements the theory should fulll, e.g. causality
[1] or tree level unitarity of graviton - massive spin 2 eld interaction [3]. these requirements can lead
to some additional restrictions on the parameters of the theory.

now we consider sigma-model description of an open string interacting with two background elds
 massless graviton g and second rank symmetric tensor eld h from the rst massive level of the
open string spectrum. we are going to show that eective equations of motion for these elds are of the
form (21) and explicitly calculate all the coecients in these equations in the lowest order in .

here ,  = 0, . . . , d  1; a, b = 0, 1 and we introduced the notation x = dx
edt . the rst term s0 is
an integral over two-dimensional string world sheet m with metric gab and the second si represents
a one-dimensional integral over its boundary with einbein e. we work in euclidian signature and re-
strict ourselves to at world sheets with straight boundaries. it means that both two-dimensional scalar
curvature and extrinsic curvature of the world sheet boundary vanish and we can always choose such
coordinates that gab = ab, e = 1.
theory has two dimensionful parameters.  is fundamental string length squared, d-dimensional
coordinates x have dimension . another parameter  carries dimension of inverse length in two-
dimensional eld theory (23) and plays the role of renormalization scale. it is introduced in (23) to make
the background eld h dimensionless. in fact, power of  is responsible for the number of massive level
to which a background eld belongs because one expects that open string interacts with a eld from n-th
massive level by means of the term

the action (23) is non-renormalizable from the point of view of two-dimensional quantum eld theory.
inclusion of interaction with any massive background produces in each loop an innite number of diver-
gencies and requires an innite number of dierent massive elds in the action. but massive modes from
the nth massive level give vertices proportional to n and so they cannot contribute to renormalization
of elds from lower levels. of course, this argument supposes that we treat the theory perturbatively
dening propagator for x  only by the graviton term in (23).

(26)

with circles denoting bare values of the elds. we would like to stress once more that higher massive
levels do not inuence the renormalization of any given eld from the lower massive levels and so the
result (26) represents the full answer for perturbative one-loop renormalization of g and h .

eld h with the mass m2 = ()1 and d + 1 additional constraints on the values of this elds and its
rst derivatives. in fact, einstein equations should not be vacuum ones but contain dependence on the
eld h through its energy - momentum tensor t h
 . our calculations could not produce this dependence
because it is expected to arise only if one takes into account string world sheets with non-trivial topology
and renormalizes new divergencies arising from string loops contribution [17]. considering this fact we
can write our nal equations arising from the weyl invariance of string theory in the form:





2h + r
h + o() = 0,
r + o() = t h
 

h  r
h  r
h 
 + o() = 0,
1

h 

g t h 



d  2

1
 h + o() = 0,

(33)

this is a system of consistent equations of motion derived in the lowest order but if one wants to determine
whether they can be deduced from an eective lagrangian (and to nd this lagrangian) then one-loop
contributions present in (33) are not sucient. comparing the eective equations of motion (32,33) with
the general form of equations for spin 2 eld discussed above we see that coecients e(i) arising in the
condition of string weyl invariance are not equations directly following from a lagrangian (17) but some
combinations of them analogous to (21). in order to reverse the procedure of passing from (17) to (21)
one would need next to leading contributions in the conditions for h and h 
anyway the specic values of coecients ai in the eective action (16) are not important due to
possibility of eld redenition (22).
in string theory this possibility can be also interpreted as nite
renormalization of the eld h . our result (33) has coecients specic for the minimal subtraction
scheme which we used performing the renormalization of background elds and composite operators.
specic values of these coecients are scheme dependent. in case of arbitrary renormalization scheme
the rst equation in (33) will take the form:

 (33).



h + c2r

2h + c1r
1
 h + o() = 0.





h + c2r

 h + c3rh + c4g rh

(34)

ci are coecients depending on the renormalization scheme and in this order in  all of them can be
made arbitrary by the eld redenition.

let us summarize the obtained results. we investigated the problem of consistency of the equations of
motion for spin-2 massive eld in curved spacetime and found that two dierent description of this eld
are possible. first, for specic gravitational background satisfying (10) one can build an action leading
to consistent equations including the tracelessness and transversality conditions. another possibility
(naturally arising in string theory) consists in building the theory as perturbation series in inverse mass.
in the lowest order no consistency problems arise and equations of motion have the form (21).

then we calculated the equations for the massive spin-2 background eld arising in sigma model
approach to string theory from the condition of quantum weyl invariance in the lowest order in . the
explicit form of the derived equations (33) appears to be a particular case of the general equations in
eld theory (21). general agreement between string theory and eld theory is achieved if one takes
into account a possibility of making eld redenitions in the eective action which in string theory
calculations corresponds to possibility of making nite renormalization of background elds. we expect
that in general in each order in  the situation remains the same and it is possible to construct the
part of string eective action quadratic in massive background eld which should lead to generalized
mass-shell and transversality conditions.

to determine this part of the bosonic string eective action completely one should also consider other
massless background elds including the dilaton. this will require investigation of strings with curved
world sheets and with non-vanishing extrinsic curvature on the boundary which complicates the sigma-
model calculations. from the eld theoretical point of view this will require to generalize the analysis of

consistency for the massive spin 2 eld propagating on background of both gravity and massless scalar
eld. we leave it for a future publication.
