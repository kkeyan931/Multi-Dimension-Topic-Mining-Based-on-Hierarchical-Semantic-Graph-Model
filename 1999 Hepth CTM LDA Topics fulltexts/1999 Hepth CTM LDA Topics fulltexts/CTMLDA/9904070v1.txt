abstract

we consider the one-loop quantum corrections to the thermodynamics of
a black hole in generic 2-dimensional dilaton gravity. the classical action is
the most general dieomorphism invariant action in 1+1 space-time dimen-
sions that contains a metric, dilaton, and abelian gauge eld, and having at
most second derivatives of the elds. quantum corrections are introduced
by considering the eect of conformal matter elds coupled to the geomet-
rical elds (dilaton and metric). back reaction of the matter elds ( via
non-vanishing trace conformal anomaly ) leads to quantum corrections to
the black hole geometry. quantum corrections also leads to modications in
the gravitational action and hence in expressions for thermodynamic quanti-
ties. one-loop corrections to both geometry and thermodynamics ( energy,
entropy ) are calculated for the generic dilaton theory. this formalism is
applied to a charged black hole in spherically symmetric gravity and to a
rotating btz black hole.

1 introduction

there exists a strong analogy between the properties of black holes and
conventional thermodynamical systems [1]. in this analogy the entropy of
the black hole is directly proportional to the surface area of its event horizon
and literature refers to this quantity as the bekenstein-hawking entropy [2].
meanwhile, the temperature of the black hole is proportional to the surface
gravity of its horizon. in spite of this established correspondence, there is
still a lack of understanding of precisely what accounts for black hole entropy
which is a pure geometrical quantity. in a usual statistical mechanical system
the entropy is explained in terms of the degrees of freedom of its microscopic
constituents. however a black hole has a limited number of such degrees of
freedom, as demonstrated by the so called no-hair theorems [3].

in recent literature, varied attempts have been made to derive black hole
entropy on statistical mechanical principles, with varying degrees of success
[4][5][6][7]. for instance, strominger and vafa [4] counted the degeneracy
of soliton bound states for extremal black holes in string theory. in a very
dierent and more geometrical approach, carlip [5] counted horizon edge
states in a gauge theory formulation of 2+1 anti-desitter gravity. another
approach that has been investigated involves sakharovs theory of induced
gravity [8] following a proposal by jacobson [9]. recent work along these
lines to generate black hole entropy has been done by frolov, furasev, and
zelnikov [6].

the success of a number of very diverse approaches seems to suggest that
the correct explanation for black hole entropy may in some sense be universal.
that is, it should depend explicitly on neither the macroscopic gravitational
form nor on a hidden microscopic quantum theory [10]. consequently, it may
prove benecial to study as wide a range of theories as feasible and in doing
so look for model independent features. such observations could potentially
provide valuable insight as to the geometrical origins of black hole entropy.
to this end, we examine the thermodynamic properties of black holes in
generic dilaton gravity coupled to an abelian gauge eld in 1+1 dimensions.
this provides a very extensive class of models which allow for black hole
solutions. even with the 2-dimensional limitation, many such models are
seen to have direct physical signicance. for instance, in the spherically
symmetric reduction of 4-dimensional einstein-maxwell gravity the dilaton

2

scalar eld corresponds to radial distance. also it has been shown that
black hole solutions of constant curvature gravity in 2-dimensions ( jackiw-
teitelboim[27]) are in fact projections of btz black holes described by 2+1
gravity with axial symmetry [11].

in recent work we have studied the classical thermodynamic properties of
generic dilaton gravity via a hamiltonian partiton function method [12][13].
in the present paper we calculate the thermodynamics so as to include one-
loop corrections. the approach we use here is based on yorks euclidean-
action method [14][15] which in turn follows from the gibbons-hawking path
integral formalism [16]. this entails taking the black hole to be in a state of
thermal equilibrium with evaporated radiation and then relating the period-
icity of euclidean time with the inverse thermodynamic temperature. first-
order quantum corrections are introduced into the procedure via a technique
applied by frolov, israel, and soldukin [17] in the study of spherically sym-
metric charged black holes. the basic idea is to add to the classical action
a correction corresponding to the one-loop eective action obtained by inte-
grating out matter elds conformally coupled to the metric and dilaton. this
one loop eective action is a suitable generalization of the polyakov action
obtainede from the 2-d conformal (or trace) anomaly[18]. the eect of these
quantum corrections on the black hole thermodynamics is two-fold. first, it
modies the black hole geometry due to the non-vanishing one-loop eective
stress-energy tensor. secondly, the surface terms which give rise to the black
hole free energy also acquire quantum corrections. as a result the formulae
relevant to calculating thermodynamic quantities ( energy and entropy ) are
modied as well. our results will hopefully provide insight into the nature
of such corrections for generic dilaton gravity as well as provide the template
for closer examination of a myriad of specic theories.

this paper is arranged as follows.

in section 2 we introduce the ac-
tion for generic 2-dimensional dilaton gravity coupled to an abelian gauge
eld. here we present the most general solution to the eld equations and
by way of the euclidean action approach [14] we are able to describe black
hole thermodynamic properties at a classical level.
in section 3 we intro-
duce one-loop quantum corrections due to matter elds propogating on a
curved background. the resulting modications to the black hole geometry
are deduced by applying the formalism of frolov et al.
[17]. in section 4
we calculate the quantum corrections to black hole energy and entropy. in
sections 5 and 6 we apply our results to the specic examples of charged

3

black holes in spherically symmetric gravity and rotating btz black holes
respectively. for simplicity both cases consider minimal coupling of matter
elds with the dilaton however the formalism to be presented is readily ex-
tendable to more general coupling scenarios. section 7 summarizes the paper
and considers future prospects for related work.

2 classical theory

in two spacetime dimensions the einstein tensor vanishes identically. con-
sequently, the construction of a dynamical theory of gravity with no more
than two derivatives of the metric in the action requires the introduction of
a scalar eld, namely the dilaton. recent works have demonstrated that the
dilaton is more than a lagrange multiplier but signicant in determining both
the symmetries and topologies of the solution [19].

here we consider the most general lorentzian action functional depending
on the metric tensor g, dilaton scalar eld  and abelian gauge eld a
in two spacetime dimensions [20][21]:

w [g, , a] =

1

2g z d2xg [d()r(g)

g +

where g is the dimensionless 2-d newton constant, f = a  a ,and
l is a fundamental constant of dimension length. also d(), v (), and y ()
are arbitrary functions of the dilaton eld.

variation of the action with respect to the metric, dilaton eld and gauge

eld respectively leads to the following set of eld equations.

where f is dened implicitly by fr = f  and q is a constant that cor-
responds to abelian charge. next we dene an eective potential v (, q)
such that

v (, q) = v ()  gl2 q2

(6)

the action and remaining eld equations eqs.[2, 3] can be rewritten as fol-
lows:

obtaining the solutions for an action of this form has been well docu-
mented in prior works [12][21] so only a brief account will be presented here.
first the action is reparameterized thereby eliminating the kinetic term (re-
quires d() 6= 0 and dd

d 6= 0 for any admissable value of  ).

2 = exp

g = 2()g

v (, q) = v (, q)/2()

the reparameterized action is then as follows:

l2 v (, q)(cid:21)

and m is a constant of integration identied as the mass observable.

next we choose a local coordinate system in which  and hence  have
spatial dependence only. the nal solutions in these static coordinates are
then obtained by exploiting the form of the killing vector. these are found
to be:

where

ds2 = g(x)dt2 + g1(x)dx2

g(x) = j()  2glm

we can then re-express this solution in terms of the original parameterization
as follows:

the timelike killing vector for the resultant eld equations is easily iden-

tiable. it is found to be:

the necessary condition for a given theory to admit black hole congu-
rations is the existence of apparent horizons. that is, spacetime curves of
the form (x, t) = o (constant) where o satises g(o; m, q) = 0. the
nature of a given black hole solution can be revealed by considering dg/d
evaluated at these event horizons  = o. for a xed value of mass m there
may exist critical values of charge q(m) so that this derivative vanishes. for
such critical values the function g(; m, q) may have either a local extremum
or point of inection at the horizon. if it is an extremum the norm of the

6

killing vector does not change sign when passing through the event horizon.
as q is varied away from its critical value either the horizon will disappear
or two event horizons (inner and outer) will appear. the latter case signies
the presence of an extremal black hole when q is at its critical value. for a
point of inection the norm of the killing vector does change sign but as q is
varied away from its critical value one expects the formation of either one or
three horizons [21].

for the subsequent (thermodynamic) analysis we consider the euclidean
sector such that t  it. hence we re-write the action eq.(7) with respect to
the euclidean metric tensor:

we =

g iouter boundary

dtd()n

(24)

(henceforth the subscript e on the euclidean action will be implied). the
second integral in eq.(24) is the extrinsic curvature boundary term.
it is
included so that when second derivatives of the metric are cancelled o (via
appropriate integration by parts) then the resulting total divergences on the
outer boundary will be cancelled o as well [16]. here we dene n as the
outward unit vector normal to the outer boundary enclosing the black hole
and  as the induced metric appropriate for evaluating the line integral.

we re-write the euclidean static metric in the following form

ds2 = g(x)dt2 + e2(x)g1(x)dx2

where e(x) = 2((x)). for this metric it follows that

g = e(x)

(25)

(26)

r = e(x)(cid:16)e(x)g(x)(cid:17)

(27)
where  indicates dierentiation with respect to x. the coordinates t, x de-
scribe a disc and will be taken to range between the limits x+  x  l
-
and 0  t  2. here x = x+ represents the black hole horizon (ie.
g(x+) = 0), x = l is the outer boundary of the black hole (ie. - box size),
and  is the asymptotic inverse temperature. it can be shown that regularity

7

of the solution requires the absence of a conical singularity which leads to
the following condition:

 =

2e(x+)
g(x+)

(28)

note that application of standard thermodynamics requires using the inverse
temperature of the box  which is red-shifted from the previously dened
quantity such that:

 = g1/2(l)

(29)

for this metric it also follows that the extrinsic curvature (dened by the
boundary term of the action) can be expressed [17]:

n =

1
2

e(l)g(l)

(30)

using these results eqs.[25-30] we can express the euclidean action func-

tional (eq.(24)), with respect to the generic static metric giving:

w = 

g z l

e(x)

(31)

we can use this form of the action to derive thermodynamic properties
of interest. these include the free energy f = (2)1w , energy e =
(2)1w , and entropy s = (  1)w .

f =

(33)

(34)

since the box temperature is taken to be t = 2 from eqs.[32-34] we obtain
the result f = e  t s. at the extremum of free energy (or equivalently
action) f = 0 and hence the second law of thermodynamics immediately
follows.

it is possible and convenient to re-express the action (eq.(31)) in a form
which, except for surface terms, vanishes on shell. dening g to be the
left hand side of eq.(8) and re-writing with respect to the coordinate system
dened by metric eq.(25) yields:

(38)

reconsider the energy e = (2)1w . since thermodynamic quantities are
presumed to be calculated for equilibrium congurations (i.e. on shell) here
we can set g0
0 = 0 giving an energy which reduces to an outer boundary
surface term:

e =

e(l)g

1

2 (l)d(l)

(39)

this expression is typically divergent as l  . (this follows from the
divergence of the euclidean action as the outer boundary goes to innity).
to resolve this dilemma we compare the energy of eq.(39) with that of a
carefully selected background geometry [22]. the background metric will be
taken here to represent the asymptotic geometry of the black hole. hence we
dene g0 = limlg(l) and the subtracted energy is given by:

esub =

(40)

we can justify this choice of background by noting the agreement between
this result with that attained for a hamiltonian partition function approach
in a prior study [12].

3 quantum corrected black hole geometry

in the path integral approach to black hole thermodynamics the matter elds
can be integrated out yielding an eective action which depends only on
elds in the classical action. hence one-loop quantum eects can be taken
into account by adding a quantum counterpart  to the classical gravitational
action wcl (eq.(24)) such that (assuming no matter coupling to the abelian
gauge eld):

w [g, , q] = wcl [g, , q] + h [g, ]

(41)

variation of this complete action yields the quantum corrected eld equations
which may be solved perturbatively. variation of the action with respect to
the metric gives us:

g(g, , q) + ht(g, ) + o(h2) = 0

(42)

is again given by the left hand side of eq.(8) and t =

where g = wcl
g

g .

the general form of the one loop eective action is [23]:

 =

1

12 z d2xg(cid:20)ar

1


r + b()2 1



r + cr(cid:21)

(43)

the rst term is the usual trace anomal that arises for minimally coupled
scalars, while the last two terms arise because of the possibility of non-
minimal coupling to the dilaton. here we will set a=1 and leave b and c as

10

unspecied parameters which will depend on the physical model under study.
note that in the case of spherically symmetric gravity the relative values of a,
b, c are the topic of some recent publications [23][24]. it is important for the
following thermodynamic analysis to put the non-local expression eq.(43) for
 in local form. we do this by introducing a pair of scalar elds  and n,
and writing:

 =

1

12 z d2xgh( + n)r + (n)  ()  b()2 + cri

+

1

6 iouter boundary

dt( + n + c)n

(44)

where an extrinsic curvature surface term has been added in analogy to the
classical case. it is straightforward to show that variation of eq.(44) yields
the following eld equations for the scalars:

and

 =

1


r

n =

1


(r  b()2)

(45)

(46)

substituting these equations back into eq.(44) yields precisely eq.(43). note
that in the 2-dimensional minimally coupled case (b = 0), n reduces to 
and only a single scalar eld need be introduced.

before proceeding we show it is possible to solve explicitly for (x) at
the classical level (as is appropriate for this analysis). this is achieved by
conformally mapping the coordinate space described by the static euclidean
metric eq.(25) to a at disc of radius zo and curvature r = . this disc
may be expressed

ds2 = e(z)(z2d2 + dz2)

(47)
where the disc coordinates  and z are taken to range between 0    2
and 0  z  z0. substituting the euclidean static metric eq.(25) into the
left hand side gives

g(x)dt2 + g1(x)e2(x)dx2 = e(z)(z2d2 + dz2)

(48)

where t =  and x+  x  l. the following relations follow directly from
eq.(48):

g(x)dt2 = ez2d2

=

g1(x)e2dx2 = edz2

to solve for n we repeat the prior analysis except here we map to a at

g(x) "c + bz l

(60)

where n(l) and c are arbitrary constants of integration. the constant n(l)
does not aect the thermodynamic quantities in the subsequent analysis, so
without loss of generality we set n(l) = (l). the remaining constant
must in principle be determined by experiment. however, we adopt the
ansatz that n(x) should reduce to (x) when b = 0, and that the geometry
should uniquely determine both  and n. with these conditions n reduces
to:

dxe(x)((x))2g(x)

if we signify gcl as the classical metric and g = gcl + g as the one-loop
quantum corrected metric it can be shown (by perturbative expansion) that
the following form of the eld equation eq.(42) is valid to rst order:

g(g) + ht(gcl) = 0

(62)

where g is given by the left hand side of eq.(8) and t can be obtained
from the variation of eq.(44). we nd:

t =

an explicit expression for t in terms of the metric is then obtained by
substituting for  and n via eq.(57) and eq.(61) respectively.
it should
be noted that the resulting equation can be equivalently obtained by direct
functional dierentiation of the action in its non-local form (eq.(43)) [25].

we again take the dilaton as representing the spatial coordinate so that
the geometric corrections are manifested in the metric. solving the eld
eq.(62) yields an explicit form of the quantum corrected metric. in analogy
to the formalism presented by frolov et al. [17] we adapt the classical static
metric (eqs.[22-23]) to the quantum corrected case as follows:

ds2 = g(x)e2w(x)dt2 + g1(x)4((x))dx2

g(x) =

2((x)) (cid:20)j(

)  2glm  2glm(x)(cid:21)

(64)

(65)

here m(x) is the rst order quantum correction to the classical mass m and
we have introduced a metric function w(x) which vanishes in the classical
limit (and where functions j and 2 are as dened by eqs.[11,13,17]).

we now solve g = ht by rst nding expressions for quantum
quantities m(x) and w(x) in terms of components of the tensor t . using
eq.(8) for g gives us:

here we have imposed the condition w(l) = 0 and have absorbed the lower
limit of eq.(82) into the constant mcl.

also of importance (particularly for the evaluation of the quantum cor-
rected entropy) is evaluation of the rst order quantum shift in the horizon
and hence in the horizon value of the dilaton eld. to this purpose we de-
ne + = +  +cl where + and +cl are the quantum corrected and
classical horizon values of the dilaton eld respectively. because the norm
of the killing vector (eq.(16)) must vanish at the horizon it follows that the
above elds must satisfy:

j(+)  2mclgl  2m(+)gl = 0

j(+cl)  2mclgl = 0

(84)

4 quantum corrections to black hole ther-

modynamics

here we calculate the thermodynamical quantities e = (2)1w and s =
(  1)w for the action functional eq.(41) which describes the one loop
quantum corrected black hole conguration:

w = wcl [g] + h [g]

= wcl [gcl] + h

wcl

g |gclg + h [gcl] + ohh2i

(88)

recall eq.(38) for the classical action wcl[gcl]. this included a term with
an integrand proportional to g0
0 and an inner and outer surface term. it is
possible and convenient to derive an analogous expression for the quantum
eective action . rewriting eq.(44) for  in terms of the static classical
metric eq.(25), using eq.(30) to evaluate the extrinsic curvature boundary
term and integrating by parts leads to:

where we have used g(x+)e(x+) = 2/ and discarded the irrelevant constant
term which results. when we combine this result for  with the rst order
quantum corrected form for wcl into eq.(88) we obtain an integral with
integrand proportional to g0
0 (gcl) along with boundary terms. since
the integrand vanishes on shell according to the eld equation (eq.(62)) we
are left with only surface contributions to won shell. these are found to be

vanish in the classical ( h  0 ) limit.

5 quantum corrections in spherically sym-

metric reduced gravity theory

next we want to use the preceding formalism to examine a specic theory.
here we consider the form of action obtained from the spherically symmet-
ric reduction of 4-dimensional einstein-maxwell gravity to a 2- dimensional
dilaton model [26]. we will specically examine the minimal case b = c = 0
so that n = . this case in particular was studied by frolov et al. [17] and
we nd our results to be in agreement.

we proceed by considering an eective action of the following form (note
that we neglect writing the extrinsic curvature term for sake of brevity but
its inclusion is implied.):

wcl = 

1

2gl2 z d2xg" r2

2

r(g) + (r)2 +(cid:16)1  q2/r2(cid:17)#

(97)

where gl2 = g(4) is the square of the 3+1 dimensional planck length and
where the eective charge q has dimensions of length. comparison with
the form of the classical action (eq.(14)) leads to the following identications:

2r

d() = d(r) =

r2
2l2

20

(98)

(99)

v (, q) = v (r, q) = 1

the classical solution eqs.[21-23] can then be expressed:

(102)

(103)

(104)

note that the constant of integration in the evaluation of the integral dened

in eq.(11) for 2 is selected to be 2 ln2. this yields a metric function
g(r) which goes to 1 as r  , which is the correct asymptotic behaviour of
the metric in spherically symmetric gravity. for subsequent calculations it
will often be convenient to express the metric function g(r) in the following
form (here we consider solutions only for which two real, distinct horizons
exist, i.e. (l2gm)2 > q2 .)

g(r) =

1
r2 (r  r+)(r  r)

where r represents the outer(+) and inner (-) horizons given by:

r = l2gm q(l2gm)2  q2

(105)

(106)

before proceeding to evaluate the quantum corrected quantities, we con-
sider the classical energy and entropy. the classical energy (eq.(39)) in terms
of r for this theory becomes:

e(r=l)g

(107)

above and for the remainder of this section l is taken to be the value of r
at the outer boundary. clearly this energy is divergent as l  . hence
we apply the standard subtraction procedure as dened by eq.(40) to give:

esub =

taking the asymptotic (l  ) limit yields the expected result liml(esub) =

next we calculate the quantum corrected quantities in spherically sym-
metric theory. recall we consider the minimal case b = c = 0 so that n =  .
to avoid confusion classical-specic quantities will be labelled with the sub-
script cl. re-writing eq.(82) for quantum corrected mass m(x) in terms
of r and substituting eq.(105) for the classical metric gives us:

also consider the case of an uncharged black hole. the classical metric
function becomes gcl = (1  r+cl/r) where r+cl = 2mclgl2 and cl =
2r+cl. an analogous calculation to that presented above then gives for the

(118)

next consider the metric function w(x). re-writing eq.(83) in terms of
r and then substituting eq.(105) for the classical metric, using eq.(111) for
the inverse asymptotic temperature and nally integrating gives the result

where m(r = l) is given by eq.(117). consider the case of large box size l.
clearly the second part of the expression is small relative to the rst. so we

24

consider the rst term only and substitute for the quantum corrected mass
(for large r = l) by way of eq.(116):

(125)

as in the calculation of classical energy we again apply the standard subtrac-
tion procedure of comparing the divergent quantity with that of a background
dened by the metric g0 = liml g(r = l). since g(l) for large l is the
quantity inside the square root sign in eq.(125) it follows that g0 = 1 2hgl2
and since e[g0] =  lg

the approach we use here is to rst x l and expand the square roots

(2 ln(l) + 1)

(127)

note that the rst order quantum correction to the energy can be attributed
to temperature eects since cl represents the asymptotic inverse tempera-
ture.

next consider the quantum corrected value of the horizon radius r+. for
this purpose we dene r+ = r+  r+cl and as previously dened m(r) =
m(r) mcl. the quantum corrected metric must vanish at r = r+ and this
relation can be expressed as follows:

0 = g(r+) = gcl(r+) 

2gl2m(r+)

r+

(128)

25

expanding to rst order about r+ = r+cl and using gcl(r+cl) = 0 and
expressing (dgcl/dr)r=r+cl in terms of cl (eq.(111)) gives:

r+ =

clgl2m(r+cl)

r+cl

(129)

note that m(r+cl) contains a factor of h( see eq.(82)). from this result we
can calculate the quantum correction to the horizon area which is propor-
tional to r2

+ = (r+cl + r+)2 and hence to rst order:

+ = r2
r2

+cl + 2clgl2m(r+cl)

(130)

finally in this section we evaluate the quantum correction to the entropy.

for this theory the entropy (eq.(96)) is:

r2
+
gl2  h
making use of the preceding result for r2

s =

2
3

(r+cl)

+ (eq.(130)) we can write:

s = scl + 2clm(r+cl)  h

(r+cl)

revising eq.(57) for this theory gives us:

(r+cl) =  ln gcl(r+cl) 

2

cl z l

z0 !
gcl(r)  2 ln  cl

(131)

(132)

(133)

using eq.(105) for gcl, eq.(111) for cl, integrating the middle term, and
simplication yields:

(r+cl) =

ln  l  rcl

(134)

the third term in (r+cl) can be interpreted[17] as the contribution
to the entropy of a two-dimensional hot gas in a box size l  r+cl and

26

temperature (2cl)1 = (r+cl rcl)/4r2

6 quantum corrections in jackiw-teitelboim

theory

in this section we examine the achucarro-ortiz black hole [11], which is a
solution to the eld equations for jackiw-teitelboim gravity[27]. this theory
can be obtained by imposing axial symmetry in 2+1 dimensional gravity, so
that the achucarro- ortiz black hole corresponds to the projection of the
btz axially symmetric black hole [28] into 1+1-dimensional spacetime. the

27

jackiw-teitelboim eld equations can be derived from an eective action of
the form [11]

wcl = z d2xg

1

2 "rr(g) + r 

j 2

2r3#

(139)

where  is the cosmological constant (dimension length2) and j is an ef-
fective charge (dimension length) which describes the angular momentum
of the bt z black hole. note that there is no kinetic term in this action so it
is of the form (eq.(14)) without the need for a eld reparametrization. this
leads to the following identication (provided we set 2g = 1 and l =  1
2 ):

 = 

1

2 r

d() = d(r) =

j 2

the classical solution eqs.[1820] can then be expressed:

for the uncharged case we nd using the revised metric function discussed

f (r) reduces to 4/r except at the horizon where the right most term in
eq.(159) becomes a divergent quantity. hence in this limit f (r+)  
and as in the preceding section the factor e2w(r+) is divergent.
next we consider the quantum corrected energy. revising eq.(94) for

in the case of large box size l the second part vanishes relative to the rst.
consequently, for large l the primary contribution to the quantum shift in
energy is a result of the shift in mass as described by eq.(155). so to rst
order in h and to zeroth order in 1

we nd

(163)

where m(r) = m(r) mcl is given by eq.(152). furthermore the rst order
quantum correction to the horizon area can be obtained from:

finally, in this section we determine the quantum correction to entropy.
for jackiw-teitelboim theory the dilaton generic entropy (eq.(96)) becomes:

s = 4

making use of the preceding result r+ (eq.(163)):

s = scl + 2clm(r+cl)  h

(r+cl) =  ln gcl(r+cl)

cl z l

gcl(r)  2 ln  cl

(167)

using eq.(146) for gcl, eq.(151) for cl, integrating the middle term and
simplifying yields:

(168)

so the complete quantum corrected entropy is obtained by substituting eq.(168)
for (r+cl) and m(r+cl) via eq.(152) back into eq.(166). for large l this
result reduces to (subtracting o the constant term):

for an uncharged black hole then the entropy is given by:

note that using eq.(156) the m(r+cl) term reduces to a constant which we

s = scl + 2clm(r+cl)

where m(r+cl) = 2

7 conclusions

we have calculated the one-loop quantum corrections for generic dilaton
gravity coupled to an abelian gauge eld. both corrections to the black
hole geometry and black hole thermodynamics were studied in detail. we
then applied our generic results to the special cases of charged black holes in
spherically symmetric gravity and rotating btz black holes. the former case
enabled us to verify our results by comparison with the tree-level calculations
of braden et al. [15] and the one-loop corrections of frolov et al. [17]. study
of btz black holes is of particular interest due to recent revelations of a
possible connection between string inspired black holes and btz geometry
[29].

although our quantum corrected results can in principle be integrated
exactly, numerical analysis will be required for rigourous study of particular
theories. such an analysis is in progress. our hope is that ultimately such
studies will lead to a better understanding of quantum thermodynamical pro-
cesses associated with black holes and hence insight into the deep mysteries
surrounding quantum gravity.
