abstract

in this work we examine generalized connes-lott models, with
c  c as nite algebra, over the two-sphere. the hilbert space of the
continuum spectral triple is taken as the space of sections of a twisted
spinor bundle, allowing for nontrivial topological structure (magnetic
monopoles). the nitely generated projective module over the full
algebra is also taken as topologically non-trivial, which is possible
over s2. we also construct a real spectral triple enlarging this hilbert
space to include particle and anti-particle elds.

1 introduction

in previous work [14], we studied the connes-lott program with the complex
algebra a1 = c(s2; c) of continuous complex-valued functions on the sphere.
the hilbert space hi, on which this algebra was represented, consisted of
one of the minimal left ideals i of the algebra of sections of the cliord
bundle over s2 with a standard scalar product. on this hilbert space the
dirac operator was taken as di = i(d  ) restricted to each of the ideals
i. the projective modules m over a1 were constructed using the bott
projector p = 1
2(1 + ~n  ~), acting on the free module a1  a1. these
modules are classied by the homotopy classes of the mappings ~n : s2  s2
i.e. by 2(s2) = z. in diracs interpretation, each integer corresponds to
a magnetic monopole at the center of the sphere with magnetic charge g
quantised by eg/4 = (n/2)h.

in the present paper we extend the above analysis of topologically non
trivial aspects in noncommutative geometry, to the product algebra a =
a1  a2, where a2 = c  c. it is clear that a  c(s2  {a, b}; c), where
{a, b} denotes a two-point space, as in the original connes-lott paper [4].
in section 2 we construct the hilbert space on which a1 is represented. this
hilbert space h(s) generalizes hi above, and is made of sections of what we
call a pensov spinor bundle of (integer or semi-integer) weight s, using a tax-
onomy introduced by staruszkiewicz [18]. a generalized dirac operator d(s)
acting on these pensov spinors is dened and, for s = 1/2 we recover the
kahler spinors of [14], while for s = 0 the usual dirac spinors are obtained.
these spinors may actually be identied with sections of twisted spinor bun-
dles or, from a more physical viewpoint, as usual dirac spinors interacting
with a magnetic monopole of charge g given by eg/4h = s.
the projective modules over a, following connes-lott, are constructed in

section 3 as m = p(a  a) where p = (cid:16)pa = 1, pb = 1

connes work [1], the smooth manifold is four-dimensional so that, taking
the four-sphere s4 as an example, we get mappings ~n : s4  s2 clas-
sied by 4(s2) = z2. however, the local unitary transformations act-
ing as pb  upbu are also classied by homotopy classes 4(u(2)) =
4(su(2)) = 4(s3) = z2. it follows that2 all bott projectors dene mod-

ules isomorphic to the module obtained from pb = 1
2(1 + 3), considered
by connes. for the two-sphere s2 this does not happen since 2(s2) = z
and 2(u(2)) = 2(su(2)) = 2(s3) = {1}. in section 4 we construct the
full spectral triple obtained as the product of the dirac-pensov triple for
the algebra a1 with a discrete spectral triple for the algebra a2. following
again connes prescription `a la lettre, we take the discrete hilbert space as
hdis = cna  cnb with chirality dis given as +1 on the a-sector and -1
on the b-sector. the discrete dirac operator ddis is then the most general
hermitian matrix, odd with respect to the grading dened by dis. elimi-
nating the junk in the induced representation of the universal dierential
enveloppe (a), yields bounded operators d(a) in h = h(s)  hdis. the
standard use of the dixmier trace and of connestrace theorem allows then
to dene a scalar product of operators in d(a). this scalar product is used
in section 4.1 to construct the yang-mills-higgs action. the main new fea-
tures in this action, as compared with connes result, are the appearance of
an additional monopole potential of strength eg/4 = (n/2)h, where n is the
integer characterizing the homotopy class of pb, and the fact that the higgs
doublet is not globally dened on s2 but transforms as a pensov eld of
weight n/2. the particle sector is examined in section 4.2 and a covariant
dirac operator d acting on hp = m a h is dened. here, the novelty
is that, whilst the a-doublet continues as a doublet of pensov spinors of
weight s, the b-singlet metamorphoses in a pensov spinor of weight s+n/2.
if one should insist on a comparison with thestandard electroweak model on
s2, this would mean that right-handed electrons see a dierent magnetic
monopole than the left-handed and this is not really welcome.
in section
5 we introduce a real dirac-pensov spectral triple by doubling the hilbert
space as h1 = h(s)  h(s). it is seen that, with the same hdis as before, it
is not possible to dene a real structure. however, a more general discrete
hilbert space h2 = cnaa  cnab  cnba  cnbb, as considered in[10, 17],
allows for the construction of a real structure on hnew = h1  h2. the
covariant dirac operator on m a hnew a m can also be dened and it is
furthermore seen that, with the use of such a non trivial projective module,
the abelian gauge elds are not slain, as they are when m = a[21].

clearly this model building led us far from a toy electroweak model. the
main purpose however is not to reproduce such a model on the two-sphere,
but rather to examine some of the topologically nontrivial structures in model
building with the simplest manifold allowing for such possibilities.

2 the hilbert space of pensov spinors on s2

the standard atlas of the two-sphere s2 = {(x, y, z)  r3 | x2 + y2 + z2 = 1}
consists of two charts, the boreal, hb = {(x, y, z)  s2 | 1 < z  +1}, and
austral chart, ha = {(x, y, z)  s2 | 1  z < +1}, with coordinates :

in the overlap hb  ha, they are related by a b = 1 and the usual
spherical coordinates (, ), given by b = 1/a = tan /2 exp i, are
nonsingular. in each chart, dual coordinate bases of the complexied tangent
and cotangent spaces are :

(2.2)

this means that the complexied cotangent bundle (t s2)c splits, in an
so(2) invariant way, into the direct sum of two line bundles (t s2) and
(t s2) with one-dimensional local bases of sections given by {} and {}.
in the overlap hb  ha, the zweibein in ha and in hb are related by :

a = (cab)1 b , a = cab b ,

(2.3)

whith the transition function cab = b/b = a/a = exp(2i),  being the
azimuthal angle, well dened (modulo 2) in hb  ha.
sections of (t s2) and (t s2) are written as  = (+1)  and  = (1) 
such that, in hb  ha,

(1)

|a = (cab)1(1)

|b .

following staruszkiewicz [18], who refers to pensov, we call such a eld a
pensov scalar of weight (1). the question is now adressed to dene pensov
scalars of weight s on s2. in general this would require a cocycle condition on
transition functions in triple overlaps. however, since the sphere is covered
by only two charts, it is enough that the overlap equation

(s)

|a = (cab)s(s)

|b

be well dened. now, (cab)s = exp(2is) is well dened when 2s takes
integer values3.
the corresponding line bundle4 will be denoted by p (s).

3the integer 2s can be identied with the integer representing an element of the second
cech cohomology group of s2 with integer values, h 2(s2, z) = z, classifying the line
bundles over the sphere s2.

4in the sequel, abusing the notation, we shall denote bundles and their spaces of sections

by the same symbol.

a local basis of its sections in hb is denoted by (s)
they are related in hb  ha by the generalisation of (2.3):

|b, and in ha by (s)

|a.

|b
and a local section is given by : (s) = (s) (s) .
on s2 with metric g = iji  j, the levi-civita connection reads

it is easy to see that lc(s) = s(s) denes a connection in the module
of pensov s-scalars generalising (2.4) above. this connection maps p (s) in
(t (s2))c  p (s). now the space of complex-valued one-forms (t (s2))c is
isomorphic to p (+1)  p (1), so that lc is actually a mapping :

lc : p (s) 7 p (s+1)  p (s1) : (s) 7 lc(s) = (cid:18)d(s)  s(s)(cid:19)  (s) .

projecting lc(s) on each term in the sum p (s+1)  p (s1) we obtain :

lc(s) =

1

2(cid:18)/s(s)(s+1) + /s(s)(s1)(cid:19) ,

where we have introduced the edth operators of newman and penrose [15]
:

= (cid:18)/s+1(s+1),  (s)(cid:19)s

.

(2.7)

in a previous paper [14], the dirac operator on kahler spinors was dened as
the restriction of i(d  ) to the left ideals of the cliord algebra bundle.
now, these ideals are identied with i e
+ = p (0) p (+1), with basis {1+i, },
and i e
in these bases, the local expressions of the dirac operators were given as :

 = p (1)  p (0), with basis {, 1  i}.

this suggests to dene a pensov spinor eld of weight s as a section

5 the real cliord algebra c(p, q) is dened by k + k = 2k, where the at
metric tensor k is diagonal with p times +1 and q times 1. this entails some dierences
with other work using the cliord algebra c(0, n) for riemannian manifolds instead of
c(n, 0) used here.

acting on (s) =   (s1/2)

the transformation law for s-pensov elds6 under a local zweibein rotation
(2.2) is related to the spinc structure of the pensov spinors :

6a pensov spinor of weight s can be interpreted as a usual dirac spinor on s2, inter-
acting with a dirac monopole of strength s. indeed, in the expression of the covariant
derivative, the term isk 12

such that the dirac operator (2.8) is odd

d(s)3 + 3d(s) = 0 .

according to (2.6), the scalar product of two pensov spinors is dened as :

h(s) | (s)i = (cid:18)(s1/2), t (s1/2)(cid:19)s1/2
the adjointness (2.7) of i/s1/2 and i/s+1/2 implies that the dirac operator
is formally self-adjoint with respect to this scalar product. after completion,
p (s1/2)  p (s+1/2) becomes a bona de hilbert space h(s) on which d(s) acts
as a self-adjoint (unbounded) operator. its spectral resolution is completely

there are thus six linearly independent conformal killing vector elds, three
of which are genuinely killing,i.e. with  = 0. they are chosen as7

the other three conformal killing vector elds (with  6= 0) are :

ikz = (cid:18) ~ + ~ (cid:19) .

as is well known, they form the lie algebra sl(2, c) with its lie subalge-
bra su(2) generated by {ilx , ily , ilz }. standard angular momentum
technique tells us that is easier to deal with the complex killing vectors :

l+ = lx + ily =  2~ + ~  ,
l = lx  ily = ~  2~  ,
l0 = lz =  ~  ~  ,

(2.13)

with commutation relations :

[l0, l] =  l , [l+, l] = 2 l0 .

the lie derivatives of  with respect to these vector elds are :

l+ =  , l =  , l0 =  .

7here we use the b coordinates to conform to standard conventions.

10

an innitesimal transformation of the zweibein by killing vectors is a rota-
tion of the form (2.2) :  7  =   i   =  + tlx , and, according to
(2.12), we identify

i  = (cid:18)x +

the transformation of the pensov basis (s) is then obtained as :

the lie derivative of pensov elds along one of the vector elds l, l0 com-

8this is quite expected since the edth operators are constructed from the levi-civita
connection which is metric compatible and the killing vector elds conserve this metric.

12

a lichnerowicz type formula follows immediately :

d(s)

2 = ( ~l(s)

tot)2  (s2  1/4) 1 .

using (2.14), the eigenvalues of the dirac operator are found to be :

through the gelfand-namark construction, the topology of m = s2{a, b}
is encoded in the complex c-algebra of continuous complex-valued functions
on m = s2  {a, b}. however, in order to get a fruitful use of a dieren-
tial structure, we have to restrict this c-algebra to its dense subalgebra
of smooth functions. this proviso made, let {f, g,   } denote elements of
a = c(m) and let the value of f at a point9 p = {x, }  m, be written as
f (p) = f(x). the vectors of the free right a-module of rank two, identied

with a2, are of the form x = p i=1,2 ei f i, where f i  a and {ei ; i = 1, 2}
is a basis of a2. let (a) = pk=0 (k)(a) denote the universal dierential

envelope of a. elements of (k)(a) can be realised, see e.g. [6], as functions
on the cartesian product of (k + 1) copies of m, vanishing on neighbouring
diagonals, i.e. f (p0, p1,    , pk) = 0 if, for some i, pi = pi+1.
the product in (a) is obtained by concatenation, e.g. if f  (1)(a) and
g  (2)(a) then their product f  g  (3)(a) is represented by

(f  g)(p0, p1, p2, p3) = f (p0, p1) g(p1, p2, p3) .

the dierential d acts on f  (0)(a) and on f  (1)(a) as follows :

(df )(p0, p1) = f (p1)  f (p0) ,

(df )(p0, p1, p2) = f (p1, p2)  f (p0, p2) + f (p0, p1) .

the involution10, dened in a by (f)(p) = (cid:16)f (p)(cid:17), extends to (k)(a) as

(f )(p1, p2,   ) = (cid:16)f (   , p2, p1)(cid:17) .

a (universal) connection on a2 is given, in the basis {ei ; i = 1, 2}, by an
(1)(a)-valued 2  2 matrix (())i

k. it acts on x = ei f i as :

f ree(x) = ei a (cid:16)df i + (())i

kf k(cid:17) .

(3.1)

9in this section points of s2 are denoted by x, y,   , while , ,    will assume val-
ues in the two-point space {a, b}. points of m = s2  {a, b} are thus written as
p = {x, }, q = {y, }, etc. and the value of a function f at (p, q,   ) will also be
expressed as f,,(x, y,   ).

10note that d(f ) = (df ) , f  a and, more generally, if f  (k)(a), then d(f ) =

(1)k+1(df ).

14

let x = ei f i and y = ei gi be two vectors of a2, then the standard
hermitian product with values in a is given by :

h(x, y ) = xi,j

(f i) jgj = xi

(f i) gi

it extends as (a)-valued on (cid:16)a2 a (a)(cid:17) (cid:16)a2 a (a)(cid:17) as

h(x  f, y  g) = f h(x, y )g .

the connection is hermitian if d(cid:16)h(x, y )(cid:17) = h(x, f reey )  h(f reex, y ).

for the product above, this yields (())i
the representation of  by functions on m  m is given by :

j = ik(())
k

j.

t(x, y) l(x, y) !
(())    k(x, y) s(x, y)

and the hermiticity condition reads :

k(x, y) = (cid:16)k(y, x)(cid:17) ,
l(x, y) = (cid:16)l(y, x)(cid:17) ,
t(x, y) = (cid:16)s(y, x)(cid:17) .

the action of the connection (3.1) is represented by :

(3.2)

(f reex)i

(x, y) = f i

(y)  f i

(x) + (())i

k,(x, y) f k

 (y) .

a projective module is dened by an endomorphism p of a2 which is idem-
potent, p2 = p, and hermitian, p = p, where the adjoint a of an endo-
morphism a is dened by h(x, ay ) = h(ax, y ). in the basis {ei}, the
projector is given by a 2 2 matrix (p )i
j with entries in a and is represented
by (p )i

j,(x). the projective module m is dened as the image of p :

m = npx | x  a2o = nx  a2 | px = xo .

the hermiticity of the projector guarantees that h, restricted to m, denes
a hermitian product in m.
in the connes-lott model [4], the projectors are of the form

((p ))i

j,a(x) = i

j and ((p ))i

j,b(x) =

2(cid:16)1 + ~n(x).~(cid:17)i

j

,

where ~ are the pauli matrices and ~n(x) is a real unit vector, mapping s2 7
s2 so that the projectors are classied by 2(s2) = z. furthermore, since
2(u(2)) = 2(su(2)) = 2(s3) = {1}, projectors, belonging to dierent
homoptopy classes, cannot be unitarily equivalent.
the target sphere s2 also has two coordinate charts h target
in these charts, the projector ((pb)) can be written as ((p b
respectively ((p a
coordinate of ~n in h target
and bra-notation :

the connection in the free module (3.1) induces a connection in the projective

it is represented by

the 2  2 matrices ((a(x, y))) are given by :

((aaa(x, y))) = ((aa(x, y))) ,
((aab(x, y))) = |ab(x, y)ih(y)| ,
((aba(x, y))) = |(x)i hba(x, y)| ,
((abb(x, y))) = |(x)i b(x, y)h(y)| ,

|ab(x, y)i = ((ab(x, y)))|(y)i ,
hba(x, y)| = h(x)|((ba(x, y) )) ,

and the universal one-form :

b(x, y) = h(x)|((bb(x, y)))|(y)i .

the hermiticity condition (3.2) yields ;

((aa(x, y)))+ = ((aa(y, x))) ,

where

|hab(x, y)i = |ab(x, y)i + |(y)i ,
hhba(x, y)| = hba(x, y)| + h(x)| .

mb(x, y) = h(x)|(y)i  1 .

(3.13)

as seen from (3.10) and (3.12), the o-diagonal connections |hab(x, y)i,
hhba(x, y)| and also b(x, y) transform homogeneously from hb to ha but
mb(x, y) transforms with the expected inhomogeneous term :

or, within the used realisation, by

((r(x, y, z))) =

((p(x)))(cid:16)((a(y, z)))  ((a(x, z))) + ((a(x, y)))(cid:17)((p(z)))

(3.15)

a connection  compatible with the hermitian structure in m implies in a
self-adjoint curvature :

ri

j = i(rk

)+kj .

(3.16)

let the connection  be extended to m a (a) by
(cid:16)x a f(cid:17) = (x)f + x a df ,

then 2 becomes an endomorphism of the right (a)-module m a (a).
the active gauge transformation (3.4) acts on the right on the space of

19

connections as  7 u = u1    u. the action of u on x is
given by a similar expression as in (3.5) with the matrices ((a)) replaced
by ((au)) = ((u))1((a))((u)) + ((p ))((u1))(d((u)))((p )) and (3.11) becomes

it is thus seen that |hab(x, y)i , hhba(x, y)| and the monopole connection
(3.13) mb(x, y) transform homogeneously under an active gauge transforma-
tion, while ((aa(x, y))) and b(x, y) have the expected inhomogeneous terms

4 the spectral triple {a, h, d, }

an (even) spectral triple,{a, h, d, }, as dened by connes [1], is given by
a c  algebra a and a hilbert space h, graded by , with  : a 7 b(h) :

f 7 (f ), a faithful, ker() = 0, and even, h, (f )i = 0, -representation,
(f) = (cid:16)(f ))+, of a acts as bounded operators.
a rst order operator in the sense that h[d, (f )], (g)i = 0 , f, g  a.

furthermore, on h, there is a self-adjoint dirac operator d, which is odd,
d + d = 0, and such that (d  )1 is compact for  6 r. it should be

here the algebra is a = c(s2  {a, b}; c) and as hilbert space we take

h = h(s)  hdis ,

the tensor product of the hilbert space h(s) of pensov spinors with a nite

hilbert space hdis = (cid:16)cna  cnb(cid:17) where na, nb are natural numbers giving

the number of generations in each chirality sector.
hdis is endowed with a grading operator:

dis =   1a

0 1b ! ,

0

(4.1)

where 1 ,  = a, b is the n  n unit matrix. on hdis there a nite dirac
operator ddis represented by a hermitian matrix odd with respect to dis :

ddis =   0 m +

m 0 ! ,

(4.2)

where m is a nb  na matrix describing the phenomenology of the masses.
the total grading in h is given by

 = 3  dis =   3  1a

0

0

3  1b ! ,

the dirac operator in h is obtained from (2.10) and (4.2) as ;

d = d(s)  1a+b + 3  ddis .

(4.3)

(4.4)

it is odd with respect to the total grading . the grading operator 3 has
been introduced in (4.4) so that the square of the total dirac operator reads

d2 = d(s)

2  1a+b + 1  ddis

2 .

21

an element  of h is represented as

  (s),a(x)
(s),b(x) ! ,

(4.5)

where each (s), (x), ( = a, b), is a pensov spinor with n generation
indices12. the scalar product is the obvious extension of (2.11) :

(; ) = zs 2(cid:20)(a)+a + (b)+b(cid:21) .

an element f  a is represented as:

fb(x)1c  1b !   a(x)

b(x) ! ,

(4.6)

(4.7)

where 1c is the 2  2 unit matrix in the cliord algebra. acting on vectors
of the form (4.5), (4.4) becomes

d =   d(s)  1a 3  m +

3  m d(s)  1b ! .

its commutator of with (f ) is :

[d, (f )] =   i c(dfa)  1a

(fa  fb)3  m i c(dfb)  1b ! ,

(fb  fa)3  m +

(4.8)

where the de rham exterior dierential is dfa = (cid:16)~ek(fa)(cid:17)k and where c((k))

denotes the cliord representation of the k-form (k) :

c(i1...ik i1  ...  ik ) = i1...ik i1...ik .

the representation  of (4.7) extends to a -representation of (a) by :

(f0df1    dfk) = (f0)[d, (f1)]    [d, (fk)] .

from (4.7) and (4.8) it follows that the element f dg  (1)(a) is represented
by

(f dg) =   fa  i c(dga)  1a fa(gb  ga)3  m +

fb(ga  gb)3  m fb  i c(dgb)  1b ! ,

the representation  of (a) is a -representation but it is not a dierential
representation of (a) in the sense that g  ker() = j0 does not imply
(dg) = 0. to obtain a graded dierential algebra of operators in h, it

4.1 the yang-mills-higgs action

the universal connection in m, given by the matrices ((a(x, y))) of (3.6), is
represented in (1)
d (a) by an operator of the form (4.10) where the dierential
forms (k)


are matrix-valued.

(cid:16)(cid:16)(1)
(cid:16)(cid:16)(1)
(cid:16)(cid:16)(0)
(cid:16)(cid:16)(0)

a (x)(cid:17)(cid:17) = (cid:16)(cid:16)a(x)(cid:17)(cid:17)  (cid:16)~ek,y((aa(x, y)))(cid:17)|y=x
b (x)(cid:17)(cid:17) = b(x)((pb(x)))  (cid:16)~ek,yb(x, y)(cid:17)|y=x
ab (x)(cid:17)(cid:17) = (cid:16)(cid:16)|ab(x, x)ih(x)|(cid:17)(cid:17) ,
ba (x)(cid:17)(cid:17) = (cid:16)(cid:16)|(x)ihba(x, x)|(cid:17)(cid:17) .
b(x) = (~ek,ymb(x, y))|y=x k

x = h(x)|(cid:16)d|(x)i(cid:17) ,
1 + |(x)|2(cid:16)(x)d(x)  (x)d(x)(cid:17) .

1/2

=

k
x ,

k
x ((pb(x))) ,

(4.22)

the monopole connection (3.13) also implements a dierential one-form :

it is also convenient to introduce the higgs eld doublets :

|ab(x)i = |hab(x, x)i = |ab(x, x)i + |(x)i ,
hba(x)| = hhab(x, x)| = hba(x, x)| + h(x)| .

the hermiticity of the connection (3.9) yields :

(4.23)

(4.24)

(4.25)

(cid:16)(cid:16)a(cid:17)(cid:17)+

= (cid:16)(cid:16)a(cid:17)(cid:17), (b) = b, (b) = b, hba| = |abi+ .

from (3.17) it follows that, under an active gauge transformation, the dier-
ential forms (4.22) and (4.23) behave as :

((u

a )) = ((ua))1((a))((ua)) + ((ua))1d((ua))
b = (ub)1b(ub) + (ub)1dub = b + (ub)1dub
u
b = (ub)1b(ub) = b
u
abi = ((ua))1|abiub , hu
|u

ba| = (ub)1hba|((ua)) .

on the other hand, under a passive gauge transformation hb  ha, accord-
ing to (3.10) and (3.14), they transform as :

a )) , a

b = b
b ,
abi(cab)n/2 , ha

((a
a )) = ((b
|a
abi = |b
a
b = b

ba| = (cab)+n/2hb

ba| ,

b + (cab)+n/2d(cab)n/2 = b

b  (n/2)(cab)1dcab .

28

this means that the higgs elds {|abi ; hba|} are actually pensov scalars
of weight {n/2 ; +n/2} and that the monopole potential cannot be repre-
sented by a globally dened one-form on the sphere, but adquires the inho-
mogeneous term (n/2)(cab)1dcab in hb  ha.
the canonical projection (4.14) induces a (1)

d (a)-valued connection in m :

d : m 7 m a (1)

d (a) : x 7 dx ,

dened by d = (cid:16)1m  d(cid:17)  .

from (3.11) and (4.22) it follows that :

|(dx)aai = i c(cid:18)d|fai + ((a))|fai(cid:19) ,
|(dx)abi = (cid:18)|abifb  |fai(cid:19)3m + ,
|(dx)bai = |i(cid:18)hba|fai  fb(cid:19)3m ,
|(dx)bbi = |i  i c(cid:18)dfb + (b + b)fb(cid:19) .

the curvature (3.15) is represented in (2)
where the dierential forms (k)
the diagonal elements of d(r) are given by :

... s are now 2  2-matrix valued.

d (a) by d(r) of the form (4.20),

aaa(cid:17)(cid:17) = ((fa)) = d((a)) + ((a))  ((a)) ,
(cid:16)(cid:16)(2)
(cid:16)(cid:16)(2)
bbb(cid:17)(cid:17) = fb((pb)) = (db + db)((pb)) ,
(cid:16)(cid:16)(0)
aba(cid:17)(cid:17) = |abihba|  ((id)) ,
(cid:16)(cid:16)(0)
bab(cid:17)(cid:17) = (hba|abi  1) ((pb)) .

the o-diagonal elements are given in terms of the covariant dierentials of
the higgs elds (4.24):

|abi = d |abi + ((a))|abi  |abi(b + b) ,
hba| = d hba|  hba|((a)) + (b + b)hba| .

(4.26)

they read

(cid:16)(cid:16)(1)

ab (cid:17)(cid:17) = |abih| , (cid:16)(cid:16)(1)

ba (cid:17)(cid:17) = |ihba| .

29

the yang-mills-higgs action is constructed as :

sy m h(d) =  trmatrixnhd(r); d(r)i2,do

=  trmatrix(cid:26)trdixnd(r)d(r)|d|2o(cid:27) ,

(4.27)

where  is a coupling constant and trmatrix is the trace of the 2  2 matrices,

product of matrices (cid:16)(cid:16)(k)(cid:17)(cid:17)+

as r  ru = u1ru, the gauge invariance of the action follows from the
obvious extension of the representation (4.16) of the unitaries in h(2)
d . with
the scalar product given by (4.21), the action (4.26) reads :

with (cid:16)(cid:16)(k)(cid:17)(cid:17). since the curvature transforms

(4.28)

4.2 the hilbert space of particle states and the covari-

ant dirac operator

the tensor product over a of the right a-module m with the (left-module)
hilbert space h is itself a hilbert space hp = m a h, with scalar product
induced by the scalar product (4.6) in h and the hermitian structure h in
the module m :

(x a ; y a ) = (; (h(x, y ))) .

a generic element of hp can be written as kpii = ei a i, where i  h
j)j = i. in the model considered here, h = h(s)(cid:16)cna cnb(cid:17)
obeys (p i
and the projective module is m = pa2, with p dened by the homotopy
class [g] in (3.3). a state kpii describing particles, is thus represented by :

30

1. a pair of pensov spinors of h(s), given by :

|a(x)i =   1

2

a(x)

a(x) !, each with na values of the generation index.

2. a single pensov spinor b(x) of h(s+n/2), with a nb-valued generation

index, such that |b(x)i =   1

2

b (x)

b (x) ! = |(x)i b(x) in hb.

the -representation  of (a) in h induces a mapping

1 : m a (a) 7 b(h, hp) : x a f 7 1(x a f ) ,
where b(h, hp) are the bounded linear operators from h to hp.
it is dened by 1(x a f ) = x a (f ) .
furthermore, there is a mapping

(4.29)

2 : homa(m, m a ) 7 b(hp) : t 7 2(t) ,

(4.30)

dened by 2(t)(cid:16)x a (cid:17) = 1(tx).

the covariant dirac operator in hp is dened, using (4.29), as

d(cid:16)x a (cid:17) = x a d + 1(x) .

(4.31)

it is easy to check that d(cid:16)x f a (cid:17) = d(cid:16)x a (f )(cid:17) so that d is

well dened in hp.
a grading in hp is dened by

and the covariant dirac operator is odd with respect to this grading :

p : x a  7 x a 

dp + pd = 0

with kpii as above, d is calculated as follows.
dkpii = ei a (cid:16)dkpii(cid:17)i
= (cid:16)(p i
  (d)aa
(d)ba

where (cid:16)dkpii(cid:17)i

= ((|abih|))  3m + ,

= ((|ihba|))  3m ,

= ((pb))d(s)((pb))  1b  i c(b)((pb)) .

now, h|d(s)|ib = d(s)b  i c(mb)b and with our choice (3.3) of the
representative of the homotopy class [n]  z, we obtain15

((pb))d(s)|ib = |id(s+n/2)b .

(4.35)

substituting (4.35) and (4.34) in (4.31) yields nally:

(cid:16)dkpii(cid:17)a
(cid:16)dkpii(cid:17)b

= (cid:16)d(s)  i c((a))(cid:17)|ai + |abi3m +b ,
= |ih(cid:16)d(s+n/2)  i c(b)(cid:17)b + 3mhba|aii . (4.36)

the matter action functional is then constructed as ;

smat(kpii, d) = (cid:16)kpii; dkpii(cid:17)

= zs 2

+ha|abi3m +b + (b)+3mhba|ai

(cid:26)ha|(cid:16)d(s)  i c((a))(cid:17)|ai
+(b)+(cid:16)d(s+n/2)  i c(b)(cid:17)b(cid:27) .

(4.37)

the hermiticity condition (4.25) guarantees that the action is real.
if an
euclidean chiral theory is aimed for, then pkpii = kpii implies that the
action (4.37) vanishes identically due to the oddness of the dirac operator
(4.33). a proposed way out, as in [22], is just to make an easy switch going
to an indenite minkowski type metric changing the + to a  = +0 so
that the presence of the 0 provides an extra factor minus one and the action
does not vanish. such a usual incantation  [12] appears highly unaesthetic
and rather unsatisfactory. it seems necessary to double the hilbert space in
order to deal with this issue. this can be achieved introducing a hilbert space

15note that with a dierent choice in (3.3), a globally dened dierential one-form would

be added to d(s+n/2) and this can always be absorbed in b.

32

hp of anti-particle states. the need of doubling the fermion elds also
arises in the usual euclidean quantum eld theory, where the fermion elds
are operator valued in fock space, in order to cure inconsistent hermiticity
properties of the propagators [16, 5]. alternative proposals were made by [13]
and more recently by [20]. related comments by [11] in a non-commutative
geometric setting, should also be mentioned.
here, however, we choose to remain with the primary interpretation of kpii
as a state in the hilbert space hp represented by euclidean wave functions.
this means that in this work we endeavour an euclidean one-particle (plus
one would-be anti-particle) eld theory, which, in a path integral formalism,
may hopefully lead to a proper quantum theory.

5 real spectral triples

5.1 the real pensov-dirac spectral triple

the complex conjugation k transforms a pensov eld of weight s, (s), into
a pensov eld (s) of weight s. besides the hilbert space of pensov spinors
(+) of weight s, denoted here as h1(+), we also introduce h1(), with spinors
() of weight s. a real structure will be induced by a pair of anti-linear
mappings j1() : h1() 7 h1(), which are required to preserve the real
cliord-algebra module structure of the spinor spaces :

j1()() = j1()()

j1()(cid:16)k()(cid:17) =  k(cid:16)j1()()(cid:17) ,

where we allow for  to be a sign factor 1.
with

j1()() = a(s) c1, k () ,

where a(s) is an arbitrary complex number, we should have

(5.6)

the phases a(s) are related by a(s) =  1 a(+s) and j1() = 1(cid:16)j1(+)(cid:17)+
.
the antilinear mappings j1() intertwine with the dirac operators d(s) as :
(5.7)

j1()d(s) =  d(s)j1() .

on h1(+), the dirac operator is chosen as d1(+) = d(s), but on h1() we may
choose d(s) up to a sign. let  1 be another arbitrary sign factor, then the
choice16

d1() =   1 d(s) ,

(5.8)

yields a dirac operator d1 =   d1(+)

0

0

d1() ! intertwining with j1 as :

j1 d1 =  1 d1j1 .

(5.9)

the representation of a1 = c(s2; c) in h1 is obtained by taking two copies
of the representation in h(s) :

1(f )   (+)

() ! (x) =   f (x)

0

0

f (x) !  (+)(x)

()(x) ! .

(5.10)

in general, a real structure j1 induces a representation of the opposite algebra
ao

1 by :

1(f ) = j1 (1(f ))+ j+
o
1 ,

so that the hilbert space h1 becomes an a1 bimodule. here a1 is abelian,
and with the representation 1 above, we have o

1(f ) = 1(f ).

with this choice :

j11 =  1 1j1 , with  1 = 1 .

(5.13)

the -sign table of connes [2, 3], corresponding to n = 2, can be satised
if we choose 1 = 1 and  1 = +1, but for the moment we shall leave these
choices open.
the spectral triple t1 = {a1, h1, d1, 1, j1} is actually a 0-sphere real spec-
tral triple as dened in [2]. for our pragmatic purposes, an s0-real spectral
triple may be dened as a real spectral triple with an hermitian involution
0 commuting with (a1), d1, 1 and anticommuting with j1.
it is implemented by the decomposition h1 = h1(+) h1(), which it is given
in, by :

0 =   11(+)

0

0

11() ! .

(5.14)

the doubling of the hilbert space is justied if we interpret the pensov
spinors of h(s) as usual (euclidean!) dirac spinors interacting with a mag-
netic monopole of strenght s.
it seems then natural to consider the (eu-
clidean!) anti-particle elds as dirac spinors seeing a monopole of strenght
s i.e. as pensov spinors of h(s).

5.2 the real discrete spectral triple

proceeding further, as in section 4, we have to compose the above s0-real
dirac-pensov spectral triple t1 with a real discrete spectral triple t2 =
{a2, h2, d2, 2, j2} over the algebra a2 = c  c. the most general nite
hilbert space allowing a a2-bimodule structure17 is given by the direct sum

although a2 is an abelian algebra and, as such, isomorphic to its opposite

18if we should require that  

2 = 1, then naa = nbb = 0 and ab = ba and the

corresponding odd dirac operator would not satisfy the rst order condition.

38

the rst-order condition [[d2, 2()], o
plies that in case 2.a) and 2.b) k must vanish.
if we asssume

2()] = 0, satised in case 2.c), im-

then

j2d2 = 2 d2j2 , with 2 = +1 ,

b = a ; b = a  .

(5.23)

(5.24)

it should be stressed that, in order to have a non trivial dirac operator,
necessarily n 6= 0. this conrms that the discrete hilbert space hdis used
in 4 does not allow for a real structure in the above sense. at last, it can
be shown[10, 17] that noncommutative poincare duality, in the discrete case,
amounts to the non degeneracy of the intersection matrix with elements

t = n. this non degeneracy condition in case 2.a) and 2.b) reads

naanbb + n 2 6= 0 and is always satised.
in case 2.c) it is required that
naanbb  n 2 6= 0 and if all ns should be equal, this would not be satised.
if we insist on equal ns, which is not strictly necessary, we are limited to
the models 2.a) and 2.b) with representations given by (5.16), (5.17), dirac
operators and chirality assignments by :

5.3 the product

the product of t1 with t2 yields the total triple t = {a, h, d, , j} with
algebra a = a1  a2. since t1 is s0-real, the product is also s0-real with
hermitian involution 0 = 0  12. the total hilbert space h = h1  h2 is
decomposed as

h = h(+)  h() ,

(5.27)

39

where h() = h1()  h2. elements of h() are represented by column
matrices of the form

()(x) = 


()aa(x)
()ab(x)
()ba(x)
()bb(x)

,




(5.28)

where each ()(x) is a pensov spinor of h1() with n internal indices
(not explicitely written down).
the total dirac operator is

d = d1  12 + 1  d2 ,

and the chirality is given by

 = 1  2 .

(5.29)

(5.30)

the continuum spectral triple t1 of 5.1 is of dimension two and its real
structure j1 obeys

j1

2 = 1 11 ; j1d1 =  1d1j1 ; j11 =  1 1j1 ,

where  1 = 1 was xed but 1 and  1 were independent free 1 factors.
on the other hand the discrete triple t2 of 5.2 is of zero dimension and j2
obeys

j2

2 = 2 12 ; j2d2 =  2d2j2 ; j22 =  2 2j2 ,

with 2 =  2 =  2 = +1.
the real structure j of the product triple should obey

j2 =  1 ; jd =  dj ; j =  j .

(5.31)

if we require that connes sign table be satised, i.e.

 for t1, n1 = 2 and 1 = 1 ,  1 = +1 ,  1 = 1,

 for t2, n2 = 0 and 2 =  2 =  2 = +1 for n2 = 0,

 for the product t , n = 2 and  = 1 ,   = +1 ,   = 1,

40

it is seen that, with j = j1  j2, the sign table for the product is not obeyed,
since such a j implies the consistency conditions

 = 1 2 ,
  =  1 =  1  2 ,
  =  1  2 ,

(5.32)

and the second condition is not satised. if we keep the same dirac operator
(5.29), it is the denition of j that should be changed19 to

j = j1  (j2 2) ,

(5.33)

and with this j the consistency conditions become

 = 1 2  2 ,
  =  1 =  1  2 ,
  =  1  2 ,

(5.34)

and these are satised. in the rest of this section, we shall assume that these
choices are made. also, in order to simplify the forthcoming formulae, we

take  = 1 so that c1 =   0
+ = j1(+) and d1() = d(s). the change of j2 to j22
that j1() = j1(+)
will not change the representation o
the s0-real structure implies that  and o, d and  are block diagonal in
the decomposition (5.27) of h and we obtain

2 since 2 is even with respect to 2.

(5.56)

the dierence is that here the higgs eld interact with the quadruplet
((()aa)), while in case 2.a) it interacts with the singlet ()bb and it is
this interaction that gives masses to the particles.
the dirac operators, d(n/2)
pensov spinor elds of spin weight s + n/2 or s  n/2, arise from

1() = d(sn/2) and d(+n/2)

1() = d(s+n/2), acting on

(cid:16)d1()(|()abih|)(cid:17)|i = d(n/2)

where ((pb)) = |ih| is the representative, chosen in (3.3), of the homotopy
class [n]  2(s2). the induced contribution of the magnetic monopole is

48

hidden in this modication of the dirac operator.
the higgs doublets of pensov elds of weight  n/2, |abi and hba| were
dened in (4.24).
a suitable action of the matter eld would be

smat(kcovii, d) = (cid:16)kcovii ; dkcovii(cid:17) .

but, if we aim for a theory admitting only chiral matter, i.e.
the hilbert space to those vectors obeying say

(5.57)

if we restrict

kcovii = +kcovii ,

(5.58)

then the above action vanishes identically. another choice for the action
would be

schiral(kcovii, d) = (cid:16)jcovkcovii ; dkcovii(cid:17) .

it is easy to show that this action does not vanish identically if

  = 1 ,

   = +1 .

(5.59)

(5.60)

(5.61)

in two dimensions connes sign table obeys the rst but not the second
condition21.
it should however be stressed that connes sign table, with
its modulo eight periodicity, comes from representation theory of the real
cliord algebras and if we restrict our (generalized) spinors to weyl spinors,
we loose the cliord algebra representation and the sign tables ceases to be
mandatory. we could then go back to 5.3 and

 with j = j1  j2 require (5.32) to hold with  1 = 11 or,

 with j = j1  (j22) require (5.34) to hold with  1 = +1 = 1.

21in four dimensions it is the rst condition that is not satised.

6 conclusions and outlook

the connes-lott model over the two-sphere, with c  c as discrete algebra,
has been generalized such as to allow for a nontrivial topological structure.
the basic hilbert space h(s) was made of pensov spinors which can be inter-
preted as usual spinors inteacting with a dirac monopole inside the sphere.
covariantisation of the hilbert space h(s)  hdis with a nontrivial projective
module m induced a spin change in certain matter elds so that we ob-
tained singlets and doublets of dierent spin content. the higgs elds also
acquired a nontrivial topology since they are no longer ordinary functions on
the sphere, but rather pensov scalars i.e. sections of nontrivial line bundles
over the sphere.
a real spectral triple has also been constructed essentially through the dou-
bling of the pensov spinors so that the hilbert space of the continuum spectral
triple became h1 = h(s)  h(s). the discrete spectral triple had also to be
extended in order that the rst order condition could be met. in contrast
with the standard noncommutative geometry model of the standard model,
in our model the continuum spectral triple has an s0-real structure while
the discrete spectral triple has not. some physical plausability arguments
for this were given in section 5.1.
it was also shown that the covarianti-
sation of the real spectral triple with the nontrivial m allows the abelian
gauge elds to survive, while they are slain if covaraiantisation is done with
a trivial module. finally a possibility of solution to the the problem of a
non vanishing action of chiral matter has been indicated, paying the price of
using a complex action.
if we address the quantisation problem in a path integral formalism, let us
rst recall that we have higgs elds which are pensov scalars of a p (s1) and
matter elds pensov spinors of type h(s2). it is thus tempting to assume that
the higgs elds should be even grassmann variables is s1 is integer valued
and odd grassmann variables if it is half-integer. in the same vein the mat-
ter elds should be odd or even grassmann variables if s2 is integer or half
integer valued. a thorough examination of this issue is however beyond the
scope of this work.

a on modules and connections

let m be a right module over the -algebra a. the set of endomorphisms
b = enda(m) has an obvious algebra structure and he left action of a  b
on x  m commutes with the right action of a  a : (ax)a = a(xa) so
that m acquires canonicall a b  a bimodule structure. the dual module
m = homa(m, a) is a left a-module and a  b acts on the right on
  m by (a, x) = (, ax) so that m is a a  b bimodule.
when m is endowed with a sesquilinear, hermitian and non-degenerate form
h : m  m  a : (x, y )  h(x, y ), there is a canonical bijective mapping

h : m  m : x  h(x)  (cid:16)h(x), y(cid:17) = h(x, y ) .

since h(xa) = ah(x), h is an anti-isomorphism with inverse

(a.1)

(h)1 = h :   h() ,

and h(a) = h()a. the inverse form h1 is dened by :

h1 : m  m  a : (, )  h1(, ) = h(cid:16)h(), h()(cid:17) .

the hermitian conjugate of a  b is dened by h(x, a+y ) = h(ax, y ).

let (a) = lkz (k)(a) be a graded dierential -envelope of a, then h
can be extended to m = m a (a) by :

h(x a f, y a g) = f +h(x, y )g ,

(a.2)

where x, y  m and f, g  (a).
dening m .
by (x a f ) = f + a x, where h( ) is written as ( ).
a connection  in m is an additive map

= (a)am, h can be extended as a mapping m  m

 : m  m a (1)(a) : x  x ,

(a.3)

which is additive and obeys the leibniz rule

(xa) = (x)a + x a da .
it denes an associate dual connection  in m by :

(, x) + (, x) = d (, x) .

(a.4)

51

it obeys (a) = da a  + a().
the extension of  to m by (x a f ) = (x)f + x a df , allows to
dene the curvature as 2 : m  m and it is seen that 2 is in fact an
endomorphism of m considered as a right -module :

2(cid:16)(x a f ) g(cid:17) = (cid:16)2(x a f )(cid:17) g .

similarly,  is extended to m and

(a.5)

(cid:16)2(g a ), x a f(cid:17) = (cid:16)g a , 2(x a f )(cid:17) .

when m has an hermitian structure, the connection is said to be compatible
with this hermitian structure, if22

d (h(x, y )) = h(x, y ) + h(x, y )

(a.6)

or equivalently if

d(cid:16)h1(, )(cid:17) = h1(, )  h1(, ) .

the mapping h relates both connections through

h(x) = h (x) or x =  (x) .

(a.7)

the curvature of a compatible connection is hermitian :

h(2x, y ) = h(x, 2y ) .

(a.8)

the algebras a and b = enda(m) are said to be morita equivalent in the
sense that there exists a b  a bimodule m and a a  b bimodule m such
that m a m  b, with the identication (x a ) y = x (, y ) and
 (x a ) = (, x) , and m b m  a with y ( b x) = y (, x) and
( b x)  = (, x) .

22here we have chosen d(a) = (da).

b real covariant spectral triples

let {a, h, d, , j} be a real spectral triple with a faithful *-representation in
the bounded operators of h,  : a  b(h) : a  (a). the dirac operator
d allows to extend this *-representation to (a) by

 : a  b(h) : a0da1    dak  (a0)[d, (a1)]    [d, (ak)] .

(b.1)

the real structure j denes a right action of a on h or equivalently a
representation of the opposite algebra ao by

o : ao  b(h) : a  o(a) = j ((a))+ j+ .

it is also generalized to (a) by23:

o : ao  b(h) : f  o(f ) = j ((f ))+ j+ .

(b.2)

it is asumed that [(a), o(b)] = 0 so that the hilbert space h is provided
with a a-bimodule structure and the tensor product

hcov = m a h a m

(b.3)

is well dened. the vectors k ii of hcov are generated by elements of the

form24 x a |i a . a scalar product (cid:16)k ii ; k ii(cid:17) in hcov is dened in
terms of the scalar product (cid:16)| i; | i(cid:17) in h, by
(cid:16)xa|ia k ra|ia(cid:17) = (cid:16)|i; (h(x, r))o(h1(, ))|i(cid:17) , (b.4)

where x, r  m, ,   m, and |i, |i  h.
it is well dened and, as usual, completion of hcov denes the covariant
hilbert space also denoted by hcov.
the representation  denes a mapping  from m to the bounded operators
b(h, m a h) by :

(x a f )|i = x a (f )|i .

(b.5)

23this denition reads o(cid:16)a0da1    dak(cid:17) = [o(ak), d ]    [o(a1), d ]o(a0), where

d  = jdj+ =  d.

24 elements of hcov could also be represented by x a |i a y , if we choose to

represent   m as y .

53

it obeys (x a f g) = (x a f )  (g).
in the same way, o denes a mapping o from m to the bounded operators
b(h, h a m) by :

o(g a )|i = o(g)|i a  ,

and o(f g a ) = o(g a )  o(f ).
it is further assumed that d is a rst-order operator, i.e. a, b  a,

h[d, (a)], o(b)i = 0 .

(b.6)

(b.7)

since [(a), o(b)] = 0, it follows also that h[d, o(b)], (a)i = 0 and more

generally that :

[(f ), o(b)] = 0 ; [o(g), (a)] = 0 .

(b.8)

it follows that

(x a f )|i a b = (x a f )(cid:16)o(b)|i(cid:17) a 
(xa) a o(g a )|i = x a o(g  )(cid:16)(a)|i(cid:17) .

(b.9)

the covariant dirac operator in hcov is dened by25 :

d(cid:16)x a |i a (cid:17) = (x)|i a 
+x a d|i a 
 x a o()|i .

(b.10)

as can be checked using (b.8) and (b.9), this operator is well dened on the
tensor product over a dening hcov.
the chirality in hcov is dened as

(cid:16)x a |i a (cid:17) = x a |i a  .

(b.11)

since  commutes with (a) and o(a) and anticommutes with d, it follows
that

(f ) = ((f )) ; o(f ) = o((f )) ,

25the   sign appears due to our denition (b.2).

54

where  is the main automorphism in the graded algebra (a). it is then
easy to show that

(b.12)

(b.13)

the real structure in hcov is dened by :

d + d = 0 .

jh(cid:16)x a |i a (cid:17) = h() a j|i a h(x) .

obviously, if j2 = 1, then also j2
if j =  j, also jh =  jh holds.
using

h = 1 and,

jh(cid:16)x a o()|i(cid:17) = (h())(j|i(cid:17) a h(x) ,
jh(cid:16)(x)|i a (cid:17) = h() a o(h(x))|i ,

it is seen that jd =  dj implies

jhd =  djh .

(b.14)

just as h is a hilbert a-bimodule, hcov is a hilbert b-bimodule with the
action of a, b  b given by :

x a |i a   (ax) a |i a (b) .

the spectral data {a, h, d, , j}, also called (non-commutative) geome-
try in [21],
is said to be morita equivalent to the geometry dened by
{b, hcov, d, , jh}.
not only hcov = m a h a m, but also h = m b hcov b m !
