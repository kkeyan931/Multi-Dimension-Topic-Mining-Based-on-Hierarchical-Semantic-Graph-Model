d-branes in an ads3 background

sonia stanciu

abstract. we study the possible d-brane congurations in an
ads3 s3t 4 background with a ns-ns b eld. we use its wzw
model description and the boundary state formalism to determine
the n =1 supersymmetric boundary states. we compare with the
corresponding classical open string sigma model. some of these
d-brane congurations turn out to preserve half of the spacetime
supersymmetry of the underlying background.

1. introduction

in the framework of the ads/sym correspondence conjectured by
maldacena in [1], important particles and vacuum congurations (in-
cluding interaction vertices) in the gauge theory are described, on the
string theory side, by d-brane congurations (wrapped or not) in the
corresponding type iib background. thus in [2] witten showed how
various d-brane congurations in the ads5  s5 and ads5  rp 5 back-
grounds are associated with the baryon vertex and the pfaan particle,
respectively, in the four-dimensional gauge theory at the boundary of
ads5. later, in [3, 4], such d-brane congurations were obtained as
classical solutions of the born-infeld action.

although the general belief seems to be that the ads/sym connec-
tion only makes sense in the higgs branch of the sym theory, a proposal
was made [5] to identify certain vacuum congurations of the large n
limit of the n=4 su(n) sym corresponding to the coulomb branch
with particular d3-brane congurations in the bulk of the ads5  s5,
whereby the d3-branes have worldvolumes parallel to the ads bound-
ary. this suggestion was further pursued in [6] where, by using a low
energy analysis, more general d3-brane congurations were analysed
in the ads bulk, and the corresponding amount of supersymmetry pre-
served by these d-brane congurations was determined.

in the face of these facts it appears desirable to carry out a micro-
scopic scft analysis of the possible d-brane congurations in various
ads-type backgrounds. such an analysis however would rely essen-
tially on the explicit knowledge of the cft underlying these string
backgrounds. unfortunately, despite the progress made in construct-
ing type iib string theories with rr background elds on ads spaces

we are still lacking a satisfactory worldsheet description for most of
these backgrounds. the only tractable case so far remains to be that
of type iib string theory on ads3 k, where k is a compact manifold,
and we allow only a ns-ns b eld. these backgrounds have received
a great deal of attention recently, in the cases where k is s3  t 4
[13, 14], or s3  s3  s1 [15], and have been studied in detail by using
perturbative methods.

here we will initiate a study of the possible d-branes which can be

formulated consistently in a superstring background dened on

ads3  s3  t 4 .

we will restrict ourselves to the case with a purely ns-ns b eld. this
will allow us to use the known superconformal theory (scft) under-
lying this background, in order to apply the boundary state formalism
[16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23].

the paper is organised as follows. in the next section we will start
with a short summary describing the bosonic background in order to
set the notation and exhibit the conformal structure. in section 3 we
will consider the boundary state formalism adapted to this particular
model; we will state the basic requirements, write down the boundary
conditions and solve for them, thus identifying the bosonic boundary
states. in order to motivate our interpretation of the boundary states in
terms of d-brane congurations we will analyse, in section 4, the clas-
sical boundary conditions produced by the corresponding open string
sigma model. in section 5 we determine the geometry of the d-brane
congurations we have found. in section 6 we extend our analysis to
the n=1 supersymmetric case, and in section 7 we discuss the fraction
of spacetime supersymmetry preserved by these congurations. we
end with a brief discussion, comparing our results with known d-brane
congurations in other ads backgrounds.

2. the bosonic ads3  s3  t 4 background

limit of a system of p fundamental strings on r

the background we are interested in appears as the near-horizon
2 and k ns-vebranes on
2t 4. its metric corresponds to an exact string background consisting
of a at space piece corresponding to t 4, a level k su(2) wzw theory
and a level k sl(2, r) wzw theory. we therefore start with a wzw
model having as the target space a direct product of group manifolds
g = g1  g2, where g1 = sl(2, r), g2 = su(2). the corresponding
wzw action will therefore be a sum of two independent terms

i = isl(2,r)[g1] + isu(2)[g2] ,

where each term is of the form

the full action of the theory includes, of course, a term corresponding
to t 4 and describing four commuting (compact) bosons. each of the
elds gi is a map from a closed orientable riemann surface  to the
lie group gi, i = 1, 2. we denote by g = g1  g2 the corresponding
lie algebra, where g1 = sl(2, r) and g2 = su(2). for these algebras we
choose the following bases of generators: {xa} for g1, and {ya} for g2
satisfying

[x1, x2] = x3 ,

[x2, x3] = x1 ,

[x3, x1] = x2 ,

and

[y1, y2] = y3 ,

[y2, y3] = y1 ,

[y3, y1] = y2 .

we also need to specify an invariant metric on g, which has a diagonal
form

 =(cid:18)1

0 2(cid:19) ,

0

with components (1)ab  hxa, xbi = diag(+, +, ) and (2)ab 
hya, ybi = diag(+, +, +).

we will use the following parametrisation1 for the group manifold

g:

g1 = e2x2e1x1e3x3 ,

g2 = e2y2e1y1e3y3 ,

(2)

where i and i, i = 1, 2, 3, play the role of the spacetime elds. in
terms of them (1) becomes a sigma-model action, with the spacetime
metric and 2-form given by

ds2

1 = d1d1 + d2d2  d3d3 + 2 sinh 1d2d3 ,

db1 =  cosh 1d1d2d3 ,

on sl(2, r), and

ds2

2 = d1d1 + d2d2 + d3d3  2 sin 1d2d3 ,

db2 = cos 1d1d2d3 ,

for su(2). (the torus will have of course at metric and no b eld.)

the exact conformal invariance of this model is based, as is well
known, on its innite-dimensional symmetry group g(z)g(z) charac-

3. boundary states

the boundary state formalism (see, e.g., [24, 25, 26, 27]) has become
in the last years one of the main approaches to the study of d-branes
in type ii string backgrounds [16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21]. using an explicit
knowledge of the cft underlying a given string background, one de-
scribes a d-brane conguration through a boundary state which is to
be thought of as a closed string state where the left and rightmoving
conformal structures are related in a consistent way. the strategy to
determine boundary states therefore consists in nding the consistent
boundary conditions on the elds which preserve the overall conformal
structure.

in the case of a background described by a wzw model the natural
variables, that is, the elds in terms of which the conformal structure
of the model is realised, are the ane currents. hence it is on them
that one imposes the boundary conditions [28]
a jb(z) = 0 ,

ja(z) + rb

(6)

5

where the constant coecients rb
r(za) = zbrb
satisfy the following consistency requirements:

a dene a map r : g  g, with
a, for any za in g. these boundary conditions have to

(i) they preserve conformal invariance. this means that the holo-
morphic and the antiholomorphic sectors are related by an auto-
morphism of the corresponding cft. in the bosonic case, since
the automorphism group of the virasoro algebra is trivial, we im-
pose

t(z) = t(z) ,

at the boundary.

(ii) they preserve the innite-dimensional symmetry of the current

algebra.

the rst thing to notice is that these two requirements are not in-
dependent. indeed, the rst one translates into the condition that r
preserve the metric on the group manifold, that is

rt r =  ,

(7)

whereas the second one gives rise to two conditions, corresponding
to the rst and second order pole in the opes dening the current
algebra: from the second order pole we obtain once again (7), whereas
from the rst order pole we derive

[r(za), r(zb)] = r([za, zb]) ,

(8)

that is, r must be an automorphism of g. hence the second require-
ment contains the rst one.

in the case of ads3  s3 the requirement of conformal invariance im-
plies that r must preserve the metric on sl(2, r)su(2), and therefore
r must belong to o(5, 1).

the second requirement allows us to make use of the fact that, in this
particular case, the lie algebra is a direct sum of two terms2, g1 and g2,
which are two dierent real forms of the same complex algebra sl(2, c).
this implies that the matrix of boundary conditions r, dened by the
map r : g1  g2  g1  g2, must take a block-diagonal form

(9)

r =(cid:18)r1

0 r2(cid:19) ,

0

where r1 : g1  g1 and r2 : g2  g2. then from (7) we deduce that
r1 and r2 must separately preserve the metric on sl(2, r) and su(2)
respectively, and therefore r1 denes an element of o(2, 1), whereas
r2 is an element of o(3).

2notice that we have chosen to ignore the at part of the target spacethat is,
t 4for which the boundary states, and indeed the possible d-branes are known.
we will instead concentrate on the nonabelian part which corresponds to the curved
part of the background.

6

on the other hand, from (8) we conclude both r1 and r2 are lie al-
gebra automorphisms, corresponding to sl(2, r) and su(2), respectively.
explicitly, each of these two automorphism conditions translates into
a condition on the corresponding matrix, that is

det(r1) = det(r2) = 1 ,

which makes r1 belong to so(2, 1), and r2 to so(3).

these results can be summarised as follows. the moduli space of
boundary states on the group manifold sl(2, r)  su(2) which pre-
serve conformal invariance and the innite-dimensional symmetry of
the underlying current algebra is given by so(2, 1)  so(3). this is
nothing but the isometry group of ads3  s3. in what follows we will
analyse in detail this set of boundary states in order to identify the
d-brane congurations it describes.

let us end this section with a remark. it might seem that the two
requirements introduced here are not necessarily equally important.
the rst condition is indeed essential, as conformal invariance is the
basic principle underlying the construction of boundary states. by
contrast, the second condition, although very natural, it is imposed
merely because it is generally thought that the requirement of con-
formal invariance is not restrictive enough to determine the allowed
congurations uniquely. one could even contemplate the possibility of
dropping the second requirement in order to analyse a more general
type of boundary state. in this case, the moduli space of such bound-
ary states would be signicantly larger, being given by o(5, 1). later
we will see that the second requirement plays however an important
role in the geometric interpretation of the boundary states in terms of
d-brane congurations.

4. relation to the sigma model approach

in order to identify the d-brane congurations described by these
boundary states we need to understand the way in which the geometric
information dening the d-brane worldvolume, that is the neumann
and dirichlet boundary conditions, is encoded in the boundary state.
this issue was discussed in some detail in [22]; there it was argued
that the answer to this problem relies on the agreement between the
structure of the boundary conditions obtained via the boundary state
formalism, on the one hand, and from the classical sigma model, on the
other. we therefore pause for a moment to analyse the corresponding
sigma model.

the action of a generic wzw model on a 2-space with a disc topology
with an additional interaction (1-form eld a) at the boundary reads

s =z

hg1g, g1 gi +z

g b +z

g a .

(10)

7

here the worldsheet  is a two-dimensional manifold with boundary
 and b represents a particular choice for the antisymmetric tensor
eld (see [29]). s may be viewed as a special case of an action for
an open string propagating on a group manifold and coupled to a at
in the case of ads3  s3 the action consists of two
the boundary.
independent terms, s1 + s2, such that each of them is of the form (10),
only with dierent target spaces, corresponding to the two groups,
sl(2, r) and su(2), respectively. however for the most part we will
work with the generic form of the action (10), and we will consider the
two components separately only at the very end.

the innitesimal variation of s contains a bulk term (yielding the
same equations of motion as in the closed string case) and a boundary
term which reads

z

d (g1g)a(cid:2)gab(g1g)b  i(bab + fab)(g1 g)b(cid:3)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

notice that we have introduced the coordinates x on the group man-
ifold, and the left- and right-invariant vielbeins dened by g1g =
axa, respectively. also, we have denoted by p
e
the component of the 2-momentum normal to the boundary  which
is given by

axa and gg1 = e

p = g x  i(b + f) x ,

where g = e

b, b = e

b and f = e

b.

thus having neumann boundary conditions in all directions amounts
to imposing p| = 0, for all . in order to compare these conditions
with the boundary conditions (6), we must express them in terms of
the same quantities that is, in terms of the conserved currents. for this
we use the expressions of the currents in terms of the spacetime elds

ja = gabe

bx ,

ja = gabe

b x ,

(11)

in order to rewrite p as follows:
  (b + f ) g]e

p = [

aja  [

 + (b + f )g]e

a ja .

then the neumann boundary conditions take the following compact
form

j + m j = 0 ,

(12)

where the matrix m depends on the background elds, being given by

m  e1 1 + (b + f )g1
1  (b + f )g1

e .

(13)

8

in our case, since all the relevant quantities (that is, the background
elds and the corresponding vielbeins) take a block-diagonal form with
respect to the two group components, the matrix m will do so as well,

m =(cid:18)m1

0 m2(cid:19) .

0

therefore we can compute the two components separately.

4.1. the sl(2, r) component. we can now compute the matrix of
boundary conditions m1 corresponding to the open wzw action s1
with target space sl(2, r). in order to do this we use the parametrisa-
tion of sl(2, r) given by the rst expression in (2). then the invariant
vielbeins e1 and e2 are given by

e1 =

the corresponding background metric will be (g1) = e

alternatively, one can write m1 in a more compact form by using
the adjoint action of the group, in terms of which we have m1 =
ad(e2y2e1y1e3y3). one can therefore see that m1 is indeed an
element of so(2, 1), as we obtained in section 3, where the parameters
are given by the elds themselves.

4.2. the su(2) component. we now turn to s2, whose matrix of
boundary conditions we denote by m2. we use the parametrisation of
su(2) given by the second expression in (2), and compute the corre-
sponding invariant vielbeins e2 and e2 which read

from this we obtain the corresponding background metric, (g2) =

also here we can use the adjoint action of the group to write m2 =
ad(e2x2e1x1e3x3). in this case the matrix describing the boundary
conditions is an element of so(3), as obtained in section 3, and again
the parameters are given by the elds themselves.

by putting m1 and m2 together we obtain the matrix of classical
boundary conditions for the open string sigma model on ads3s3. it is
important to notice that this analysis shows that the classical boundary
conditions are described by a (eld-dependent) automorphism of the
corresponding lie algebra, which concurs with the second requirement
for constructing a boundary state that we discussed in section 3.

5. d-brane solutions and geometry

in order to identify the d-brane congurations described by the
boundary states found in section 3, we must rst of all specify what
we mean by neumann and dirichlet boundary conditions. this step is
particularly important in the case of a wzw model since the bound-
ary conditions are not imposed directly on the elds but rather on the
chiral currents.

we therefore evaluate the conserved currents at the origin (which
turns out to be equivalent to taking the at space limit). for the
sl(2, r) currents we nd that, at i = 0, they read

i|0 = 1x1  2x2  3x3 ,
i|0 = 1x1 + 2x2 + 3x3 .

this shows that a neumann boundary condition is given by ia =  ia,
which in turn corresponds to a +1 eigenvalue of r, whereas the dirich-
let boundary condition corresponds to ia = ia and therefore to a 1
eigenvalue of r. similarly for the su(2) currents, a neumann boundary
condition will correspond to ja =  ja, and hence to a +1 eigenvalue of
r, whereas the dirichlet boundary condition will be given by ja = ja,
and will have 1 eigenvalue in r. therefore in order to identify the
d-brane congurations described by our boundary states, we have to
study the eigenvalues (and eigenvectors) of the linear operator r.

it is easy to see that the neumann directions are indeed tangent
to submanifolds of g; that is, to the d-branes. indeed, if we denote
by g+ the subalgebra generated by the eigenvectors corresponding to

10

the +1 eigenvalues of the matrix r (the neumann directions), then the
frobenius theorem tell us that g+ is the tangent space of a submanifold
of g. as a matter of fact, frobeniuss theorem guarantees that every
point in g is contained in a unique submanifold whose tangent vectors
are the killing vectors in g+; that is, g is foliated by its d-branes.

we consider the boundary states which preserve the ane algebra
of the chiral currents, which are described by matrices r belonging to
so(2, 1)  so(3). we rst analyse the two components, r1 and r2,
separately.

a boundary state in sl(2, r) is given by an element r1 of so(2, 1),
2,1. as

and hence can be thought of as a lorentz transformation in r
such, it can describe:

(i) spatial rotations, in which case r1 has generically one +1 eigen-
value, with the corresponding eigenvector (describing a neumann
direction that is, parallel to the worldvolume of the d-brane) be-
ing time-like;

(ii) boosts, in which case r1 has generically one +1 eigenvalue, but

with the corresponding eigenvector being space-like;

(iii) null rotations, in which case r1 is generically not diagonalisable.
by contrast, a boundary state in su(2) is described an element r2
3. it is generically characterised by a
in so(3) that is, a rotation in r
+1 eigenvalue, whose eigenvector corresponds to the direction which is
left invariant by the rotation.

if we now put the two matrices, r1 and r2, together we obtain the
boundary states for the wzw model on ads3  s3. corresponding to
the three possible types of boundary states on ads3, we will distinguish
three cases:

(i) in the case where r1 takes the form of a spatial rotation, the
matrix r of boundary states in ads3  s3 is typically of the form

r =

for generic values of  and , r describes a d5-brane which lls
the whole ads3  s3. if  = (2k + 1), with k integer, then r
describes a d3-brane wrapped on s3, and whose worldvolume is
given by s3 times a time-like curve in ads3, that is3 s3  r. it
is easy to see that this conguration is topologically stable. if, on
the other hand,  = (2m + 1), where m is an integer, then r
describes a dierent d3-brane which is noncompact, as it lls the

3we consider the innite cover of sl(2, r), such that the time direction is non-

compact.

11

ads3 space, but has one direction wrapped on a circle in s3, such
that its worldvolume is ads3  s1. finally, if  = (2k + 1) and
 = (2m + 1), with k, m integers, then r describes a d-string
wrapped on a s1  s3, and whose worldsheet is s1  r.

(ii) if we consider r1 to be described by a boost (which we take, for
concreteness, to be in the y1 direction), then the corresponding
boundary state on ads3  s3 will be of the form

r =

again, for generic values of the two parameters, this corresponds
to a d5-brane lling the whole target. notice that in this case we
can never achieve a 1 eigenvalue corresponding to a direction in
ads3. if however  = (2m+1), with m integer, then r describes
a noncompact d3-brane whose worldvolume is given by ads3s1.
(iii) finally, if we consider r1 to have the form of a null rotation then

r will take the form

r =

the d-brane congurations described by this solution are some-
what similar to the ones in the previous case, the only dierence
being that previously the +1 eigenvalue corresponded to a space-
like direction, whereas in this case it corresponds to a null (or
light-like) direction.

6. the n=1 supersymmetric extension

let us start by introducing the n=1 supersymmetric extension of

the ane lie algebrabg, which we will denote bybgn =1 =bsl(2, r)n =1

the guiding principle behind constructing a boundary state is con-
formal invariance. consistency means in this context that the holo-
morphic scft is set equal to the antiholomorphic scft, up to an
automorphism of the n=1 sca, that is z2.4 the boundary conditions
on the ane currents read in this case

(22)

a and sb

where rb
a are dened as before by r, s : g  g, with
r(za) = zbrb
a, for any za in g. the consis-
tency requirements that these boundary conditions will have to satisfy
are:

a and s(za) = zbsb

4these boundary conditions have been written down previously in [19], in the

context of kazamasuzuki models.

13

(i) they preserve the superconformal invariance, that is

t(z) = t(z) ,

g(z) = g(z) ,

at the boundary.

(ii) they preserve the innite-dimensional symmetry of the n=1 cur-

rent algebra (14)-(19).

in section 3 we have seen that in the bosonic case these two condi-
tions are not independent, but rather the second requirement implied
the rst one. here we will show that the two requirements translate
into two equivalent sets of conditions. the rst requirement translates
into a number of conditions on the matrices r and s. thus, from the
quadratic terms in the currents we obtain that

rt r =  ,

st r =  ,

which immediately implies that

s = r ,

(23)

as one would expect from supersymmetry. further, from the cubic
terms in the currents we have that

[s(za), s(zb)] = s([za, zb]) ,

which, together with (23), implies that

[r(za), r(zb)] = r([za, zb]) ,

[r(za), s(zb)] = s([za, zb]) . (24)

if we now look at the second requirement we can see that it yields no
additional conditions on the matrices r and s.

moreover since we know from the bosonic case that r takes a block-
diagonal form (9), the condition (23) implies hat s must have a similar
form

(25)

s = (cid:18)r1

0 r2(cid:19) .

this shows that every bosonic boundary state that we determined can
be made into an n=1 supersymmetric boundary state without having
to impose additional conditions. hence all the bosonic d-brane con-
gurations we have found in the previous section can be thought of as
n=1 supersymmetric d-brane congurations.

7. spacetime supersymmetry

one of the most important properties of (most) d-brane congura-
tions is that they preserve some of the spacetime supersymmetry of
the background in which they live, which translates into the fact that
they satisfy the bps condition. in the context of superconformal eld
theories spacetime supersymmetry appears as a by-product of n=2
superconformal invariance, being related, via bosonisation, to the u(1)

q =i dze



2 s(z) ,

(26)

14

current. instead of following this standard approach, here we will anal-
yse the spacetime symmetry preserved by the d-branes we found using
a dierent route, which was described in [13].

we will therefore consider the spacetime supercharges to be con-
structed directly from the n=1 scft, by choosing ve fermion bilin-
ears and bosonising them into ve scalar elds hi, with i = 1, . . . , 5
as follows

h1 =

1
k

(12) ,

h2 =

1
k

(12) ,

h3 =

1
k

(33) ,

h4 = (12) ,

h5 = (12) .

the corresponding spacetime supercharges will then read [30]

where  is the scalar eld which appears in the bosonised superghost
system of the fermionic string, and

s(z) = e

(27)

i

2pi i hi ,

is a linear combination of the spin elds, where the coecients i = 1
label the possible supercharges, subject to a number of requirements
(for a detailed discussion see [13]). thus, due to the requirement of mu-
tual locality between the various supercharges, and of brst invariance
these coecients must satisfy the following conditions:

123 = 1 ,

45 = 1 .

this yields eight supercharges for each of the holomorphic and antiholo-
morphic sectors of the superstring background, which are displayed in
table 1.

phic sector.

unfortunately, due to the nonlocal nature of the dependence of the
spacetime supercharges on the fermionic elds, it is rather dicult
to determine the fraction of spacetime supersymmetry preserved by
the most general boundary states we have identied. for this reason
here we will limit ourselves to analysing the d-brane congurations
characterised by the absence of mixed boundary conditions.

15

given a certain boundary state, we can use the boundary conditions
obeyed by the fermionic elds in order to derive the boundary con-
ditions satisfyed by the supercharges. to illustrate, let us work out
explicitly one example, the d3-brane wrapped on s3. the correspond-
ing boundary conditions satised by the fermions read

1  1 = 0 ,
1 + 1 = 0 ,

2  2 = 0 ,
2 + 2 = 0 ,

3 + 3 = 0 ,
3 + 3 = 0 ,

where we have systematically ignored a  sign coming from (25), which
does not aect the fermion bilinears in the expression of s(z). there-
fore we deduce that i = i, for i = 1, 2, 3. since we are considering
d-branes embedded in ads3 s3, the boundary conditions correspond-
ing to the fermions on the torus are always the same (that is, dirichlet),
and will therefore give i = i, for i = 4, 5. from this it follows that

q = q ,

 = 1, . . . , 8

this means that this particular d-brane conguration preserves half of
the spacetime supersymmetry of the background.

one can similarly analyse all the other d-brane congurations we
specied in section 5. the results are summarised in table 2, where the
coecients a
 are the elements of the matrix a = 14 1. the second
column contains the directions tangent to the d-brane worldvolume,
where 1, 2, 3 refer to sl(2, r), in particular 3 corresponds to the time-
like direction, and 4, 5, 6 correspond to su(2). by looking at the table,
we can nally conclude that all these congurations preserve half of
the spacetime supersymmetry.

8. discussion

in this paper we have studied, using the scft framework and the
boundary state formalism, the possible d-brane congurations which
one can consistently dene in an ads3  s3 background characterised
by a purely ns-ns b eld.

it is perhaps worth noting a certain similarity between one of the
d-brane congurations in this ads3  s3 background and a d-brane
conguration in the ads5  s5 background. indeed, our solution de-
scribing a d3-brane wrapped over the s3, is reminiscent of the cong-
uration discussed in [2, 3, 4] consisting of a d5-brane wrapped on s5
in the ads5  s5 background (and describing a baryon vertex in the
corresponding four-dimensional gauge theory).

it might come as a surprise the fact that we do not obtain a d-
string conguration in the ads space, parallel to the fundamental string
and the ns5-brane which give rise to this geometry. however such a
conguration, although it can preserve conformal invariance, it does not
preserve the structure of the chiral algebra; in particular its tangent
space would not form a lie subalgebra, and hence its worldvolume
could not be understood as a submanifold in the ads space.
