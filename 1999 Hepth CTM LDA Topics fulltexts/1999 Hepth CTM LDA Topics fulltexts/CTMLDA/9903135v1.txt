abstract

a universal lagrangian that denes various four-dimensional massive yang-
mills theories without higgs bosons is presented. each of the theories is charac-
terized by a constant k contained in the lagrangian. for k = 0, the lagrangian
reduces to one dening the topologically massive yang-mills theory, and for k = 1,
the lagrangian reduces to one dening the freedman-townsend model. new mas-
sive yang-mills theories are obtained by choosing k to be real numbers other than
0 and 1.

understanding of mass generation for gauge elds is one of the most important
subjects discussed in the non-abelian gauge theories. the higgs model is widely
accepted at present as a popular model describing mass generation for yang-mills
elds in four dimensions. although the higgs model is attractive because of its
renormalizable structure, the higgs bosons have not been found experimentally
yet. hence, four-dimensional massive yang-mills theories without higgs bosons
may be useful as alternative (or eective) theories of the higgs model.

until recently, several massive yang-mills theories in four dimensions that
involve no higgs bosons have been presented. the oldest theory is the non-
abelian stuckelberg formalism [1] or, equivalently, the gauged nonlinear sigma
model [2]. the non-abelian stuckelberg formalism has actually been applied to
the construction of an electroweak model [3], and to the description of gluon mass
generation in continuum qcd [4].

besides the non-abelian stuckelberg formalism, a model presented by freed-
man and townsend [5] is known as a four-dimensional massive yang-mills theory
without higgs bosons. this model is constructed with a non-abelian rank-2
antisymmetric tensor eld, which is treated in this model as an auxiliary eld.
freedman and townsend showed the classical equivalence of their model to the
non-abelian stuckelberg formalism.

recently, another four-dimensional massive yang-mills theory without higgs
bosons has been presented by lahiri and by barcelos-neto, cabo and silva [6].
this theory is formulated as a non-abelian generalization of the topologically
massive abelian gauge theory (tmagt) discussed in [7], and will be called,
in the present paper, topologically massive yang-mills theory (tmymt). a
non-abelian rank-2 antisymmetric tensor eld introduced in the tmymt has
own kinetic term in the lagrangian, and is not treated as an auxiliary eld. a
electroweak model based on this theory has also been considered by barcelos-neto
and rabello [8].

in the present paper, we would like to propose a universal lagrangian that de-
nes various four-dimensional massive yang-mills theories without higgs bosons.
we demonstrate that the lagrangian for the tmymt and that for the freedman-
townsend model are obtained by choosing a constant contained in the univer-
sal lagrangian to be suitable numbers.
in addition to the tmymt and the
freedman-townsend model, the universal lagrangian denes new massive yang-
mills theories without higgs bosons.

let us begin by considering a four-dimensional non-abelian gauge theory

dened by the lagrangian

l(k) =

f  a   a + iq[a, a] .

(3)

here a is a yang-mills eld, b is a non-abelian antisymmetric tensor eld,
 and u are non-abelian vector elds, m is a constant with dimensions of
mass, and k and q are dimensionless constants. [ the conventions for the metric
signature and the levi-civita symbol are (+, , , ) and 0123 = 1. ] all the
elds take values in the lie algebra of a compact semisimple gauge group g, and
are expanded as x = pdimg
a=1 x ata with respect to the generators ta of g. under

the gauge transformation

a = d ,
b = d  d + iq[b , ] ,

 = m + iq[, ] ,
u = iq[u, ] ,

(4)
(5)
(6)
(7)

with the lie algebra valued parameters  and ,1 the lagrangian l(k) remains
invariant up to total derivative terms. the euler-lagrange equations for b, 
and u are derived from l(k) as follows:

where

(f  2du + 2iqkuu) = 0 ,
[u , f  2kdu] = 0 ,
1
(ch + 3iqk[ bb, u]) ,

u  =

bb  b 
(d  d) ,
ch  d bb + d bb + d bb .

(8)
(9)

(10)

(11)

(12)

we nd from eqs.(4), (5) and (6) that bb and ch transform gauge covariantly
in the same way as u. applying the covariant derivative d on eq.(8) and
summing over  lead to eq.(9); hence, eq.(9) is compatible with eq.(8). the
vector eld  is necessary to treat eq.(9) as an euler-lagrange equation derived
from l(k). applying the covariant derivative d on eq.(9) and summing over 
do not yield further constraints by means of eq.(8).

1the vector eld  obeying the transformation rule (6) has also been introduced in a yang-
mills theory in loop space [9], in which  is treated as a constrained nambu-goldstone eld
on loop space.

before proceeding to discuss the non-abelian theory,

let us consider the

abelian case g = u(1). the lagrangian l(k) then takes the following form:

la = 

+

m
4

f f  +

m2uu  .

1
4
1
2

b(f  2u)

(13)

here it should be noted that the lagrangian la does not contain  and k. in
this case, eq.(8) becomes a simple equation (a  u) = 0, which can
locally be solved as

u = a 

1
m



(14)

with a scalar eld . substituting eq.(14) into eq.(13), we have the lagrangian
dening the abelian stuckelberg formalism:

las = 

1
4

f f  +

1
2

(ma  )(ma  ) .

(15)

on the other hand, eq.(10) becomes

u  =

1
6m

h ,

(16)

where h  b + b + b. substituting eq.(16) into eq.(13) and
removing a total derivative term, we obtain the lagrangian dening the tmagt
in four dimensions [7]:

lta = 

1
4

f f  +

1
12

hh  +

m
4

b f .

(17)

thus, using an equation of motion, la reduces to las or lta; the lagrangians
las and lta are classically equivalent. their equivalence is also established at
the quantum level by using the path-integral method [10]. equations (14) and
(16) give the relation ma   = 1
6 h , which demonstrates the duality
between  and b. the tmagt is therefore dual to the abelian stuckelberg
formalism both at the classical and quantum levels.

we now return to the non-abelian theory. apart from the trace over the
generators ta, the lagrangian la is just the quadratic part of l(k). from this
we see that l(k) describes a massive yang-mills eld with (bare) mass m. let
us rst consider the case k = 0. in this case, the right-hand side of eq.(10) does
not include u , which makes possible to eliminate u from the lagrangian l(0),
given by eq.(1) with k = 0, so as to get a polynomial lagrangian containing no
u . substituting u  = 1

6m ch into l(0) and removing a total derivative

4

term, we obtain

lt = 

+

1
4
m
4

tr(f f ) +

1
12
tr(b f) .

tr(chch )

(18)

the same is also obtained, quantum mechanically, by carrying out the gaussian
integration over u in the vacuum-to-vacuum amplitude based on l(0). hence,
l(0) is equivalent to lt both at the classical and quantum levels. the massive
yang-mills theory dened by the lagrangian lt, which we call topologically mas-
sive yang-mills theory (tmymt), has been presented by lahiri and by barcelos-
neto, cabo and silva [6] as a non-abelian version of the tmagt discussed in
[7]. the quantization of the tmymt has recently been studied by lahiri and
by hwang and lee [11]. a characteristic of lt is that it includes a polynomial
kinetic term for b. we would like to emphasize that unlike in the abelian case,
the vector eld  is essential to the tmymt to maintain the non-abelian gauge
symmetry.

we next consider the case k = 1. the lagrangian l(1), given by eq.(1) with

k = 1, can be written as

lft = 

+

1
4
1
2

tr(f f ) +

m2tr(uu ) ,

m

tr( eb f)

eb  b 

iq

([, u]  [, u]) ,

where

and f is the eld strength of v  a  u :

f  v   v + iq[v, v] .

(19)

(20)

(21)

notice that the second and third terms in l(1) have simply been expressed with
the tensor eld eb; the vector eld  hides in eb, and does not occur in
lft explicitly. the massive yang-mills theory dened by the lagrangian lft
has been presented by freedman and townsend [5], and is called the freedman-
townsend model. the quantization of the freedman-townsend model has been
studied by thierry-mieg and baulieu in a systematic manner [12]. from eqs.(4)

(7), the gauge transformation rules of eb and v are found to be

 eb =    + iq[ eb , ] ,
v =  ,

where

   + iq[v,

] .

5

(22)
(23)

(24)

clearly, lft is gauge-invariant up to a total derivative term. the euler-lagrange
equation for eb is

f = 0 ,

(25)

which agrees with eq.(8) with k = 1. in the case k = 1, eq.(9) reduces to the
commutator of eq.(8) and u with the summation over , and hence is not an
independent equation of motion. for this reason, it is not necessary to take into
account eq.(9) with k = 1; the vector eld  is not essential to the freedman-
townsend model. if u is eliminated from lft by repeatedly using eq.(10) with
k = 1, then lft turns out to be a lagrangian including a nonpolynomial kinetic
term for b. this shows a dierence between the tmymt and the freedman-
townsend model.

the equation (25) can locally be solved as

v =

1
iq

v1v

(26)

in terms of v( g) represented as v = exp(cid:16) iq

m pa ata(cid:17) with scalar elds a.

after substitution of eq.(26) into eq.(19), we have the lagrangian dening the
non-abelian stuckelberg formalism [1,2,17]:

ls = 

1
4

tr(f f ) +

1
2

m2tr(eu eu ) ,

(27)

where eu  a  1

iq v1v. the freedman-townsend model is therefore classi-
cally equivalent to the non-abelian stuckelberg formalism [5]. since the tmymt
is classically dierent from the freedman-townsend model, the tmymt can not
be considered, at least classically, the dual theory of the non-abelian stuckelberg
formalism.
[ in the abelian limit q  0, the tmymt becomes dual to the
stuckelberg formalism both at the classical and quantum levels. ] the classically
dual theory of the non-abelian stuckelberg formalism is described by the non-
polynomial lagrangian that is obtained by eliminating u from lft by repeatedly
using eq.(10) with k = 1 expressed as

u  =

1
2m

 eb .

(28)

the nonpolynomial lagrangian is thus written in terms of a and eb. the
duality between ( ata) and eb is guaranteed from the relation eu  =
2m ( eb +   ) whose right-hand side is a power series that is determined
from eq.(28) by iteration with respect to u.

1

the equivalence and the dierence between the massive yang-mills theories
characterized by lt, lft, and ls have been discussed at the classical level with
aid of the equations of motion.
in general, classical equivalence between two

6

theories does not imply their equivalence at the quantum level [13], and vice
versa [14]. since the lagrangians lt, lft, and ls involve interaction terms,
that is, the terms disappearing in the abelian limit, it is by no means clear
whether the equivalence and the dierence discussed above persist at the quantum
level. further study is needed to understand quantum-mechanical equivalence
and dierence between the massive yang-mills theories.

the lagrangian l(k) can collectively dene various four-dimensional massive
yang-mills theories distinguished by the constant k. among them, the tmymt
and the freedman-townsend model, which correspond to the cases k = 0 and
k = 1 respectively, are considered particular theories. we would like to emphasize
in this paper that besides these known theories, there exist new massive yang-
mills theories obtained by choosing k to be real numbers other than 0 and 1. it
should be noted that the new theories need both the vector elds  and u: 
and u are necessary for l(k) to be gauge invariant up to total derivative terms
and to be polynomial, respectively. since l(k) describes various four-dimensional
massive yang-mills theories without higgs bosons, we may call l(k) a universal
lagrangian for massive yang-mills theories without higgs bosons. in the abelian
limit, l(k) becomes independent of k; that is, all the massive yang-mills theories
dened by l(k) have the same abelian limit. apart from the trace over the gen-
erators ta, this limit can be regarded as the tmagt because of the equivalence
of la and lta.

non-abelian generalizations of the tmagt have also been studied in terms
of the antield-brst method without introducing extra elds such as  and
u [15]. this study concludes that it is not possible to generalize lta so as
to incorporate power-counting renormalizable interaction terms consisting only
of a and b. obviously the non-abelian generalizations dened by l(k) lie
outside the scope of the proof in ref.[15].

needless to say, it is important to investigate the renormalizability and the
unitarity of the massive yang-mills theories dened by l(k). beginning the in-
vestigation, we, however, face a diculty at once: the vector eld  has no
kinetic term in l(k), and, in the abelian limit, disappears from l(k). conse-
quently, the ordinary perturbative procedures can not be used to investigate the
renormalizability of the theories.
in addition, the proof of unitarity based on
the kugo-ojima quartet mechanism [16] can not be applied to the theories. the
point we have to consider rst is therefore how we should treat  within the
framework of the perturbation theory.

as for the freedman-townsend model, the problem of disappearing  can be
avoided by treating eb as a fundamental eld. the unitarity of the freedman-

townsend model is then shown in terms of the kugo-ojima quartet mecha-
nism, while the renormalizability of the model is still an open question; it is
by no means obvious whether the perturbatively nonrenormalizable structure of
the non-abelian stuckelberg formalism in four dimensions [17] persists in the
freedman-townsend model, because their equivalence is not clear at the quan-

7

tum level. thus, the renormalizability of the freedman-townsend model should
also be studied in the future.
