1. introduction

in the previous paper [15], we have obtained bps dp-brane in iia theory from
non-bps d(p+1)-brane via tachyon condensation in form of kink solution. in this
article, we will continue in this approach and we will see, that due to the tachyon
condensation on n non-bps d9-branes in iia theory, we can construct unstable
system consisting d8-branes and d8-antibranes, conrming results in [5]. the lower
dimensional branes can then arise as tachyon kink solution on this system and in this
step by step construction we will be able to construct all d-branes in iia theory.
it is clear, that with action for system brane and antibranes, that will be presented
in this paper, we could construct all d-branes in iib theory as well, following [4].

the starting point in our analysis is action for non-bps dp-brane, proposed
in ref.[1]. sen argued, that non-bps d-brane must contain on its world-volume 32
fermionic degrees of freedom, because this brane completely breaks bulk s persym-
metry of iia theory. the supersymmetric invariant action for bps brane contains 32
fermionic degrees freedom, but half of them is unphysical due to the presence of local
gauge symmetry on world-volume of bps d-brane,  symmetry [12].we can expect,
that non-bps d-brane has the same dbi action as bps brane, simply for the rea-
son, that these branes have common origin and have the same spectrum of massless
bosonic degrees of freedom on their world-volume. dbi term is manifestly invari-
ant under space-time supersymmetry, which should be hold for non-bps d-brane as
well, as a consequence of the fact, that this brane is embedded into supersymmetric
theory. on the other hand, dbi term is not invariant under  symmetry alone, so
we cannot gauge away one half of fermionic degrees of freedom. the same is true
also for bps d-brane, but the action for this brane must contain wz term and this
whole action is invariant under  symmetry, leading to possibility of gauging away
one half of fermionic degrees of freedom, which results into bps d-brane.

sen also showed, how to incorporate eect of tachyon into this action. because
tachyon has mass of order of string scale, there is no systematic way how to obtain
eective action for it, but we can estimate form of this action on some general
grounds. the presence of tachyon was incorporated into original action for non-bps
d-brane with introducing the some f function, that has a basic property, that for
tachyon equal its vacuum value, this function is zero, which leads to the vanishing of
action for non-bps d-brane resulting into appearance of super symmetric vacuum
of iia theory.

in previous paper[15], we have used the action for non-bps d-brane, proposed
by sen in ref. [1], for construction of bps brane from higher dimensional non-bps
d-brane. for better understanding of new results, we review this construction in
following part.

in this paper, we generalize this construction for system of n non-bps d9-
branes, in order to obtain relation of our construction with k-theory construction,

1

proposed in ref.[5]. with using the tachyon kink solution given in [5], we obtain
action, that can be expressed as sum of actions for brane and antibranes. we will
argue, that this approach is not completely correct, because we know, that this
system is unstable, so we could expect presence of tachyon eld. then we generalize
tachyon kink solution and we obtain action, that has not been previously known in
literature, but we will argue, that this action is exactly action for system of brane and
antibrane. the arguments for validity of this conjecture will then be given. firstly,
we will show, that kink solution of tachyon on world-volume of pair brane+antibrane
results, as expect, to the unstable non-bps d-brane in iia theory. as a further
check, we will show, that this action under (1)fl operation presented in [6] leads to
the action of non-bps d-brane with the same dimension as in iia theory and then
with further sodding with (1)fl to the action for supper-symmetric d-brane in iib
theory with completely agreement with [6].

as a last result, we present construction of vortex solution on world-volume of
d8-brane+antibrane pair resulting into stable bps d6-brane in iia theory, with
agreement with topological arguments presented elsewhere [6, 7, 5, 4]. this solution
can be indication of further research in one step construction of lower dimensional
branes from non-bps d9-brane in iia theory, in the same way as in [5].

this is brief outline of present paper.

in conclusion, we return to the issue
with wz terms, that not correctly reproduces this results and we present some
speculations about this problem.

2. action for non-bps d-brane in iia theory

in this section we review construction of lower dimensional bps brane from non-bps
d-brane, as was presented in [15]. the reader, who is familiar with this paper, can
skip into section devoted to the multibranes solutions on n d9-branes in iia theory
1.

we start this section with recapitulating basic facts about non-bps d-branes
in iia theory, following [1]. let ,  = 0, ...p are world-volume co-ordinates on
d-brane. fields, living on this d-brane arise as the lightest states from spectrum of
open string ending on this d-brane. these open strings have two cp sectors [3]: rst,
with unit 22 matrix, which corresponds to the states of open string with usual gso
projection (1)f |i = |i, where f is world-sheet fermion number and |i is state
from hilbert space of open string living on dp-brane. the second cp sector has cp
matrix 1 and contains states having opposite gso projection (1)f |i = |i.
the massless elds living on dp-brane are ten components of x m (), m = 0...9, u(1)
gauge eld a() and 32 component of fermionic eld  transforming as majorana

1we work in units 2l2

s = 1, metric has signature (, +, ..+) and majorana spinors are real and

gamma matrices are pure imaginary.

2

spinor under transverse lorenz group so(9, 1). we can write  as sum of left handed
majorana-weyl spinor and right handed majorana-weyl spinor:

 = l + r, 11l = l, 11r = r

(2.1)

all elds except r come from cp sector with identity matrix, while r comes from
sector with 1 matrix.

as sen [1] argued, action of non bps d-brane should go to the action of bps
d-brane, when we set r = 0 (we have opposite convention that [1]). from this
reason, action of non-bps d-brane in [1] has been constructed as supersymmetric
dbi action, which is manifestly supersymmetric invariant, but has not  symmetry,
so we cannot gauge away one half of fermionic degrees of freedom, so that this action
describes non-bps d-brane. in the following, we will not need the general form of
this action, because we would like to have clear physical interpretation of our result,
so that we will work in static gauge:

s = cz dp+1q det(g + f)
g + f =  + ijij + f
2l( + ii)l  2r( + ii)r +
+(lm l)(lm l + rm r) +
+(rm r)(lm l + rm r)

(2.2)

where f = a  a is a eld strength for gauge eld and c is constant equal
to the dp-brane tension (we work in units ls = 1) .

now if we set r = 0, we obtain action for bps d-brane as in ref. [12].
the next thing is to include the eect of tachyon. in order to get some relation
between tachyon condensation and supersymmetric d-branes, we would like to have
an eective action for massless eld and tachyon living on world-volume of non-bps
d-brane. this eective action should appear after integrating out all massive modes
of open string ending on dp-brane. because tachyon mass is of order of string scale,
there is no systematic way to obtain eective action for this eld, but we can still
study some general properties of this action. following ref.[1], the eective action
for non-bps dp-brane with tachyonic eld on its world-volume should have a form:

s = z dp+1qdet(g + f)f (t, t, dt, ... g

a , g

s ) + iw z

(2.3)

where g
a,s are symbols introduced in [10], that are appropriate quantities for open
string in presence of general background arising in closed string sector. in this note,
we are interested in the simplest case, where metric is at and b eld is zero, so that
this quantities can be taken to be trivial.

3

in the function f the constant c is included , so that for t = 0, f = c and we
obtain action for non-bps d-brane (2.2). this function has a important property
[1], that for tachyon eld t = t0, where t0 is a vacuum value of tachyon eld, this
function is zero 2:

f (t0) = 0

(2.4)

we also have iw z = 0 due to the fact, that wz term has a form for non-bps
dp-brane [11]:

iw z = czp+1

c  dt  ef +b  g

(2.5)

where g is geometrical part of wz term, but in our case we take normal and tangent
bundles to be trivial, so this term is trivial as well. we see, that for t = const., this
terms is zero. when on the whole world-volume the tachyon is equal its vacuum value
t0 (recall, that vacuum value of elds is the value, that minimise potential for this
eld), the action is identical zero and we end with pure supersymmetric vacuum,
which is satisfactory result, because we expect, that after tachyon condensation,
non-bps d-brane disappears and we obtain supersymmetric vacuum.

now we are interested in nontrivial behavior of tachyon on world-volume of non-
bps d-brane. in other words, we would like to construct kink solution for tachyon.
as was explained elsewhere [2, 5], when we have one non-bps d-brane, tachyon eld
must be real and consequently there is no coupling between tachyon and gauge eld
living on world-volume of non-bps d-brane. it can be shown [2, 3], that potential
for tachyon must be even function of t , so that we have two values of t , that
minimise potential for tachyon. in other words, we have two ground(vacuum) states
for tachyon eld : {t0,t0} 3.

in order to construct supersymmetric d-brane as topological solution of elds
living on world-volume of non-bps d-brane, we expect, that these massless eld are
slowly varying, so that we can expand dbi action in standard form, when derivatives
of massless elds are small. as a result, we obtain action for u(1) gauge eld and
massless scalars i, i = p + 1, ...9, describing transverse uctuations of d-brane, as in
ordinary construction of bps d-branes [13, 14]. there are also terms for fermionic
elds r, l, so that action has a form

s = z dp+1(ff  + 2ijij + f.t.)f (t, t...) + iw z

(2.6)

2in fact, sen argued, that in case of constant t , f reduces to the potential for tachyon and as a
consequence of general form of potential for tachyon, this term is zero for t = t0. in this article, we
slightly change behavior of this function, because we only demand, that in point on world-volume,
where tachyon is equal to its vacuum value t0, we should recover supersymmetric vacuum, so that
there are no elds living on non-bps d-brane, so we have (2.4).

3to see, why tachyon is real, we must consider general case of n non-bps d-branes, where
tachyon lives in adjoin representation of u (n ) gauge group. because u(1) has no adjoin represen-
tation, tachyon eld is real eld with charge zero. this has important consequence in construction
f function in (2.3).

4

, where f.t. means term containing both left handed and right handed fermionic
elds r, l. we need not to know direct form of this term, we only must know, that
in case of r = 0 and t = 0, this action goes into sym action with gauge group
u(1) describing bps dp-brane in low energy limit.

now we would like to construct kink solution for the tachyon eld. this means,
that we must solve equation of motion for tachyon, which can be obtained from (2.6).
because tachyon is present only in f function, we can obtain equation of motion for
tachyon from this function. in the next part we must determine on some physical
grounds form of this function. we expect, that interaction terms between tachyon
and other massless elds must be present in this function, because as in ref.[1], when
we set t = 0, we must obtain action for non-bps d-brane.

we write f as

f = c(v (t ) + g(t, r, l))

(2.7)

, where v(t) is potential for tachyon and in g we have included kinetic term for
tachyon and all interaction terms between tachyon and spinor elds and we have used
the fact, that tachyon has charge zero with respect of gauge eld a. for the same
reason there is no interaction term between tachyon and scalar eld i, because we
know, that non-bps dp-brane transform under t duality into non-bps d(p  1)-
brane, which results into transformation of component of gauge eld in direction of
t transformation into scalar eld describing position of t dual d(p-1)-brane in dual
direction, and because tachyon has no charge with respect to gauge eld, we can
conclude, that there is also no interaction between tachyon and scalar eld (we have
at metric and b=0, so that we have no interaction between tachyon and light elds
coming from closed string sector).

now we must discuss possible form of g function. we know from previous
discussion, that l comes from cp sector with identity matrix and r comes from
cp sector with 1. as we know, open string amplitudes comes with factor containing
trace of cp matrix. interaction vertex with two fermionic lines and k tachyon lines
contain following trace (we are interested only in terms with two fermionic elds
without derivatives, because interaction with more fermionic elds and with more
derivatives do not give new information):

tr((1)k11)

(2.8)

where rst matrix corresponds to the tachyon, the second matrix to l and the
third matrix to r. from the identity tr(2n+1
) = 0 it is clear, that k must be odd.
we than propose interaction between tachyon eld and one spinor eld from left
handed sector and one eld from right handed sector:

1

g(t, r, l) = f (t )rl + t t

(2.9)

5

where f (t ) are odd function of t and where we have included only terms with two
derivatives of tachyon into g 4.

now, we are ready to construct kink solution on non-bps d-brane. we suppose,
that tachyon is function only one co-ordinate, say x1. firstly, we should ask what
happen, when t is equal one of vacuum expectation value in one particular point.
we know, that f in (2.6) must be zero in this point, because we should obtain pure
supersymmetric vacuum in this point:

f = c(v (t0) + f (t0)rl) = 0

(2.10)

, because v (t0) is zero and there is no reason why f (t0) should be zero (for example,
in the simplest case f (t ) = t , this function is clearly nonzero in t = t0 ), the only
possibility is to take either r or l to be zero. we choose r = 0 in the point, where
t = t0. we must also mention, that other elds are not restricted in this particular
point.

in kink solution, tachyon approaches in limit x1   one vacuum value (say
t0) and then in limit x1   the vacuum value t = t0. we can take special limit
of this solution, when tachyon is dierent from its vacuum expectation value t0 only
in small region around point x1 = 0 and in extreme case, t has a form:

t (x1) = (t0,

t0 x1 > 0

x1 < 0

(2.11)

of course, this is very special function and there could be some opinions, why we
do not take terms with higher derivatives into g, but we expect, that these terms
make behaviour of our solution more singular, so that in any case, f looks like
f  (x1)(this can be seen from the fact, that potential term in (2.10) is nite
function and singular behaviour comes from derivative term). now from (2.9) we
can obtain the equation of motion for tachyon

(2.12)

dt  (x1) and dt 2

we know, that dv (t )
is singular as well, but because delta function
is even function, this function is odd, we can expect, that these two terms cancel
among themselves, and because we suppose, that f (t ) is polynomial in t , that is
nite in region x1 = 0, we can conclude, that in order to satisfy equation of motion
for tachyon, we must demand, that r is zero in x1 = 0 as well.

dx2

4we can also consider interaction in the form: g(t )(rr + ll), where now g(t) is even

function in t . as will be explained letter, it is natural to consider this term to be zero.

r = 0

(2.13)

6

this result is with agreement with our original assumption, that massless elds
vary slowly on world-volume of non-bps d-brane, because in case of nontrivial de-
pendence of r on x1, its derivative would by proportional to the delta function and
then r certainly does not vary slowly on world-volume of non-bps d-brane.

we know, that in extreme case (2.11), we have

f (x1)  c(x1)

(2.14)

5 and when we insert this term into (2.6), we obtain integral over (p-1) spatial
direction, which can suggest, that we have obtained low energy action for bps d(p-
1)-brane (condition r = 0 in original action leads to the action for bps dp-brane)
6, but there are two puzzles, that must be resolved. firstly, when we insert (2.14)
into (2.6), we also obtain following terms

x1|x1=0

, where  is any massless world-volume eld. but we know, that there is no depen-
dence of any eld in resulting (p-1) dimensional action on x1, so we must demand,
that this term is zero.

x1|x1=0 = 0

(2.15)

the other problem arises with scalars describing transverse uctuation of d-
brane. any dp-brane has (9-p) world-volume scalars describing uctuation of this
d-brane in transverse directions. original non-bps action has (9-p) scalar elds, but
now we would like to have action for d(p-1)-brane, so that there should be (10-p)
scalars. we can obtain this additional scalar from gauge eld. remember, that in
original action we have had a term (now m, n goes from 0...p and ,  = 0...p  1 ):
(2.16)

fm n f m n = 2f1f 1 + ff 

we see, that additional scalar can be rst component of gauge eld a1, that has

kinetic term

2f1f 1 = 2a1a1

(2.17)

, that has the same form as term for scalar elds in (2.6), so that after renaming
a1 = p, we obtain (10-p) scalars, the correct number of scalar elds describing
transverse uctuations for d(p-1)-brane. from previous facts and from (2.13) we
conclude, that kink solution on non-bps dp-brane forms bps d(p-1)-brane, that

5we give more precise numerical factor bellow, after xing vacuum value of tachyon.
6we must remember, that we are working in units 2ls = 1, so that tension of dp is ( c  1/g ),
but when we would work in units, where 2ls is not one , than integral over x1 would be multiplied
with ls , so we would obtain tension for d(p-1)-brane as t  cls  ls
, which is a correct
tension for d(p-1)-brane.

is localised in x1 direction. this can be also conrmed with wz term [11], that in
extreme case has a form (dt (x1) = (x1)dx1)

iw z = zr1,p1

c  ef

(2.18)

which has the same form as wz term for bps d(p-1)-brane.

3. multibrane solutions on n 9-branes in iia theory

in this part we would like to analyse tachyon solution on n 9-branes in iia theory
proposed by horava in ref.[5]. firstly, we must say a few words about potential for
tachyon taking value in adjoin representation of u(n). we can expect this potential
in the form:

v (t ) = m2tr(t 2) + tr(t 4)

(3.1)

this potential leads to the ground state value of tachyon, where all eigenvalues are
equal, possibly up to sign. 7.

as in ref. [5], we take tachyon vacuum value in the form:

t0 = tv  1nk 0
1k!

0

(3.2)

we see, that this vacuum value is invariant under gauge transformations of the form
u(n  k) u(k),because each element, that belongs to this gauge group, has a form

  a 0
0 b!

, where a  u(n  k) and b  u(k). now we take solution of equation of motion,
where tachyon forms kink. this kink solution should lead to the collection of 8-branes
and antibranes [5]. in particular, tachyon can look around point x = 0 as:

t =   x1nk

0 x1k!

0

(3.3)

this kink form state with n  k 8-branes in point x = 0 and k anti 8-branes
in the same point . of course, we can expect, that this conguration is unstable,
which can be seen from supergravity point of view as a result of attractive force
between brane and antibrane, so that k branes anhilate with k antibranes resulting
into stable conguration of n  2k branes (we consider situation, where n  k is
larger than k.). firstly, we will analyse the tachyon solution (3.3) in the same way as

7this potential is not zero for t = t0.to get potential, that is zero for t = t0. we add constant
to the potential, that leads to v (t ) = m2tr(t 2) + tr(t 4) + tr(t0)4. this function is zero for
t = t0. in the following, when we speak about potential for tachyon, we will mean this expression.

8

in case of one non-bps d-brane presented in the previous section and we show, that
this analysis leads to the action describing n  k d8-branes and k anti d8-branes.
however we will see, that tachyon eld in the form (3.3) leads to the solution, where
is not complete clear instability of these conguration. in other words, in resulting
action the terms describing tachyon arising from open string connecting brane and
antibrane are missing. then we show, that simple modication of tachyon solution
in (3.3) leads to the expression, that can be interpreted as correct action for the
conguration of branes and antibranes.

we start our analysis with wz term for non-bps d-brane [11], that has a form:

s = az c  d(cid:16)trt ef(cid:17)

(3.4)

where a is a constant proportional to d-brane charge and where geometrical part
is trivial due to the fact, that there is no normal gauge bundle. we see, that this
term is gauge invariant, because contain trace over matrices in adjoin representation.
but when we make expansion of exterior derivate

trd(t ef ) = trdt  ef + trt d(ef )

we would like to have each term invariant separately. natural generalisation is to
take covariant derivate in place of ordinary exterior derivate, so we obtain the result:

iw z = z cp+1  trd(t ef )

(3.5)

where d = d + [a, ] 8. as a check, we would see, that this new wz term correctly
reproduce charge of d8-branes and d8-antibranes, after using (3.3) 9.

we have conjectured, that tachyon eld t describing conguration of n  k d8-
branes and k d8-antibranes has a form (3.3)(as in [5] we do not consider possible
convergence factor.). we suppose, that near the core of the vortex, tachyon is in
its vacuum value. we have also seen, that this t breaks gauge symmetry into
u(n  k)  u(k). we would like to know, whether (3.2) places some restrictions on
gauge elds. we demand, that this conguration must solve equation of motion for
tachyon, so that exterior derivate dt is zero in the point, where tachyon is equal to
its vacuum value. because except the point x = 0, tachyon is in its vacuum value (we
consider solution in the form (2.11).), we have dt = 0, so that we obtain condition
for gauge eld outside the point x = 0:

[t0, ax] = 0

(3.6)

8arguments for the using of covariant derivate in place of ordinary derivate come from t-duality.
we consider term try t , where y is a eld on d-brane describing transverse uctuation of brane in
this direction. when we apply t-duality in this direction, we obtain term trdt , where scalar eld
was replaced with covariant derivate. we can than expect, that all derivates should be replaced
with covariant derivates.

9there are important objections to this result, that will be presented in conclusion.

9

we write ax as follows:

c d!
ax =   a b

and after inserting into (3.6), we obtain:

"  1nk 0

1k! ,  a b

c d!# =   0

0

2b

2c 0 !

(3.7)

, where we omit constant factor. we than see, that b, c = 0, in other words, gauge
elds divide into two parts corresponding to the gauge group u(n  k) and u(k)
respectively. when we look at (3.3), we see, that tachyon eld breaks gauge symmetry
also in point x = 0, we can than expect, that gauge eld is in two subgroups of gauge
group everywhere as well, because we do not expect singular change in the gauge
group. this result has a direct consequence, because we have

[t (x), ax(x)] = 0

(3.8)

for all x, so that covariant derivate t is the same as ordinary derivate : dt = dt .
we than obtain

trd(t ef ) = trdt ef + trt d(ef ) = trdt ef

(3.9)

where we have used the bianchi identity df = 0. from (2.11), that holds for all
diagonal elements, we obtain:

dt (x) =   (x)1nk

0

0

(x)1k! dx

and using the know result from algebra:

tr(  a 0

0 b!  c 0

0 d! == tr(ab) + tr(cd)

we arrive to the nal result :

i = z c  trdt  ef = z c  dx(x)trnkef z c  dx(x)trkef 

=

= zd8

c  trnkef zd8

c  trkef 

(3.10)

(3.11)

(3.12)

where f  u(nk) is identied with eld strength for nk 8-branes and f   u(k)
is eld strength identied with k anti-8-branes.

this result can be expected in the action for n  k branes and k antibranes,
consequently can serve as a justication of validity of construction branes through
tachyon condensation. but this cannot be nal result, because there is missing term

10

expressing instability of this conguration, as in [16]. we will see, that we do not
obtain correct result even in case of more general tachyonic kink solution. we return
to this important question in conclusion.

as a next step, we start analyse action for non-bps d-brane in the same way
as in previous section. because we do not know exactly the dbi action for system
of n-brazes, we take low energy limits with all derivatives and all eld strength of
massless elds to be small, so that generalised action for n 9-branes looks like:

s = z (1 +

)(trfm n f m n + 2itrlm dm l +

1
4
+2itrrm dm r)f (t, dt, ...) + iw z

(3.13)

where we have introduced a constant term and as in ref.[1] we expect, that for
t = 0 this action comes to the action for n non-bps d-branes, so that we have
f (t = 0) = c. from this reason, the terms in brackets must be separately gauge
invariant and f must be gauge invariant as well. we generalise results from ref.[15]
for the case of n non-bps d-branes, so that we we can expect f in the form:

f (t, dt..) = trdm t dm t + tr(f (t )rl) + v (t )

(3.14)

now we suppose kink solution of the tachyon eld in the form (3.3) (more precisely,
we take kink solution with diagonal term to be equal to (2.11).). we know, that this
solution break gauge symmetry into u(n  k)  u(k). again we demand, that in
some particular point x where t = t0 this system is equivalent to the supersymmetric
vacuum, so we have f (t0) = 0 and this condition place some constrains on massless
elds 10 . firstly, we analyse gauge elds.

in place, where t = t0 , we must have dt = 0, which again leads to the
separating gauge elds into two parts, ax, transforming in adjoin representation of
u(n  k) and ax transforming in u(k). even if the breaking of gauge group appears
only in x-th component, this must hold for the other components as well, because
the braking of gauge group does not depend on component of particular eld. we
see, that there are no other conditions for these elds, except the well know fact,
that must vary slowly. from the previous section we know, that massless elds must
be independent on x direction for tachyon eld forming kink solution. with using
this fact, we obtain from kinetic term for gauge eld following result:

trfm n f m n = trnkff  + trkf f

 + trnkfxf x + trkf xf

x

(3.15)

where: m, n = 0, ...9, ,  = 0, ...8. we see, that the rst two terms correspond to
the eld strengths of gauge elds living on world-volume of 8-branes and 8-antibranes,

10this condition is equivalent to the condition, that tachyon must obey equation of motion
t = 0.

f (t )

11

and the third and the fourth term correspond to the transverse uctuation of 8-branes
and antibranes after renaming ax = x:

trnkfxf x = 2trnk(x + [a, x])2 = 2trnk(dxdx)

(3.16)

and the same form for antibranes.

in the same way we will analyse the fermionic term in point, where t = t0. in

this point, the function f (t ) in (3.14) looks like:

f (t0) =   k(t0)1nk

0

0

k(t0)1k!

(3.17)

where function k follows from the form of f . now we write fermionic terms as

r =   a b

g h!
c d! , l =   e f

(3.18)

where a, e are matrices with (n  k) rows and (n  k) columns, d, h are k  k
matrices and c, g are k(n k) matrices and nally b, f are matrices with (n k)
rows and k columns. with this expansion, the potential term in point t = t0 is

trf (t )rr = trnkk(t0)(ae + bg) + trkl(t0)(cf + dh)

(3.19)

again, this term must vanish. as in case of single non-bps d-brane, we have some
possibilities to obey this condition and we take

a = 0, d = 0

(3.20)

in point t = t0, but due to the same arguments as in one non-bps brane, this
must be extended over the whole axis x. the other choices are either b, c = 0 or
g, h = 0. we take g, h = 0 , in order to obtain nontrivial interaction, when we will
consider generalised tachyon solution in the next section.

g = 0, f = 0

(3.21)

in the same arguments as before, these two matrices must be zero on the whole
x axis. as a next step, we insert this result into kinetic terms for fermions in (3.13).
we start with r. as in previous situation for gauge eld, we demand, that fermionic
elds are independent on x co-ordinates:

xl = 0, xr = 0

so that derivative part in covariant derivate for r has a form:

trrm m r = trnkcc + trkbb

(3.22)

(3.23)

12

and term with gauge eld is:

trlm [am , l] = trnkc(ac  ca) + trkb(ab  ba) +
+trnkc9(xc  cx) + trkb9(xb  bx)

(3.24)

where we now take x direction as 9-th direction and we have renamed a9 as x
and  = 0, ...8. we can see, that the last term expresses nonlocal character of spinor
elds, because relates scalar components living on brane with scalar component living
on antibrane. it seams to be strange and we return to this puzzle in a moment. we
must also argue, that appearance of these terms is natural, again from the reason of
t-duality, where from standard gauge covariant term, that will be written bellow,
we obtain exactly this term.

the gauge covariant terms for c, b are:

trkb(b + (ab  ba))
trnkc(c + (ac  ca))

(3.25)

in the following part, we would like to argue, that this lagrangian correspond
to the fermionic degrees of freedom arising from string theory point of view as a
fermionic states from r sector of open string stretching between n  k 8-branes
and k 8-antibranes, so that from string theory we have transformation law for these
spinors

  gh1, g  u(n  k), h  u(k)

(3.26)

11. we must also note, that these spinors, are complex, where this complex property
is a consequence of the fact, that these fermions come from the oriented string,
so that we have two degrees of freedom for each string starting on i-th brane and
ending on j-th brane (in case of non oriented strings theory, these fermions will be
real, because they are majorana-weyl spinors and can be real in appropriate basis for
dirac matrices.). from the transformation property of spinor modes on n 9-branes
under transformation of the form

u =   g 0

0 h! , g  u(n  k), h  u(k), u  u(n  k)  u(k)

and

  uu1

11this transformation law is the same as for tachyon, that was presented in [4], because we have
ij = gikhjlkl = gik(h)ljkl = (gh1)ij .

from string theory analysis of chen-paton factors: 

13

that holds for both left and right handed spinors, we obtain for

r =   0 b
c 0 !

the transformation property for c and b

b = gbh1, c = hcg1

(3.27)

we see, that these spinors transforms as in (3.26), so we can interpret these spinors as
spinor states coming in string theory point of view from sector of strings connecting
brane and antibrane. as other check, we can show, that (3.25) is invariant under
u(n  k)  u(k) symmetry, where gauge elds transforms as:
a = dgg1 + gag1, a = dhh1 + hgh1

(3.28)

where g, h have the same meaning as before. we introduce covariant derivative
db = db + ab  ba, that transforms as:

db = g dh1

(3.29)

so that rst term in (3.25) is gauge invariant:

b

db = trk(hbg1g dbh1) = trkb db

trk

(3.30)

where we have used( b = gbh  b = b0 = gbh1) and where for simplicity
write d instead d. 12 from the fact, that  = , we obtain c = b, so that
both two terms in (3.25) are the same.

now we would like to analyse form of l. we see, that in (3.18), f and g are

zero. we than have:

lm m l = trnkee + trkhh

(3.31)

where we again use (3.22). the part with gauge elds gives:

lm [am .l] = trnke[a, e] + trkh[a, h] +
+trnke9[x, e] + trke9[x, h]

(3.32)

.(we rewrite e  , h  ).
12we must say a few words about notation. when we write tr = trt 0 =pi,j t

ij 0ij,
where symbol t over  means operation of transposition related to the spinor indexes as in ordinary
qft and indexes i, j can be interpreted as labeling dierent species in internal symmetry.

14

 is eld coming from the string sector living on n  k 8-branes and  is eld
coming from the string sector living on k anti 8-branes. with this notation we obtain
from (3.31,3.32) the well known terms for spinor elds living on branes:

trnk(d + 9[x, ])
trk(d + 9[x, ])

(3.33)

we are now ready to write the complete action after tachyon condensation. with
using (3.12,3.15,3.16, 3.24,3.25,3.33) and with the fact, that as in case of one non-bps
brane, we have f (x) = c(x) 13 , so we obtain

s = sbrane + santibrane

(3.34)

sbrane = czr1,8

trnk(cid:16)ff  + 2dxdx + 2i(d+
+9[x, ])(cid:17) + trk(b db + b9(xb  bx))
c  trnkef

+zr1,8

and for anti-brane

santi = czr1,8

trk(cid:16)f f  + 2dxdx + 2i(d+
+9[x, ])(cid:17) + trk(b db + b9(xb  bx))
c  trkef 

zr1,8

(3.35)

(3.36)

we see, that due to the tachyon condensation into kink solution of the form
(3.3), we obtain action for n  k 8-branes and k 8-branes. we also see, that both
action for branes and antibranes contain the common term, that from the string
theory point of view comes from r-sector of string connecting brane and antibrane.
the form of the whole action, that is expressed as sum the two action for dierent
branes and antibranes suggests, that from the tachyon solution, we obtain brane
and antibrane, that are distinguishable, but there is a dierence from ref.[8]. in that
paper,a covariant derivate for tachyon in the action for brane, that contain only
gauge eld living on brane, is dt = dt + at and on antibrane is dt = dt  at ,
while in case of indistinguishable branes, we have covariant derivate for tachyon
dt = dt + at  at (in our case, tachyon correspond to the spinor eld coming
13again, we do not carry about precise numerical factors, which will be given in the next section.

15

in our approach, we have branes
from string connecting brane and antibrane.).
and antibranes, that seam to be distinguishable, which can be natural property
of them, because branes carry rr charge and antibranes carry opposite charge,
but covariant derivate for spinor eld contain both gauge eld living on brane and
antibrane: db = db + ab ba. it seams to us, that this covariant derivate is more
appropriate for eld, that arise from string sector connecting brane and antibrane,
because this eld, that for example now live on brane, can also eld gauge eld living
on antibrane. in (3.34) is also term, that relates transverse uctuation of brane and
antibrane due to the spinor eld (xb  xb), that again supports idea, that these
eld can have string theory interpretation in terms of string connecting brane and
antibrane.

the other puzzle is with tachyon. we know, that system of brane and antibrane is
unstable, so that there should be tachyon presented in the action reecting instability
of these conguration. in the next section we will show, that simple modication of
tachyon solution in (3.3) leads to correct result.

4. generalised tachyonic solution

firstly we must ask, what form of tachyon eld we would like. we demand, that out-
side the point x9 = 0, where branes and antibranes are sitting, the system should be
equivalent to the supersymmetric vacuum, so that tachyon must be in their vacuum
value

1k!
t0 = tv  1nk 0

0

(4.1)

the question is, how this solution looks like around point x9 = 0. again we would
like to have kink solution on diagonal elements of tachyon elds, that in extreme case
is

t (x9)diag = tv 1nk 0

1k! , x9 < 0, t (x9)diag = tv  1nk

0

0

0 1k! , x9 > 0

(4.2)

but generally, there could be nonzero tachyon eld in non-diagonal form in point
x9 = 0, which must be zero in points outside x9 = 0, so that we take solution in the
form

t (x) =   t0(x)1nk t (y)(x)
t (y)(x) t0(x)1k!

(4.3)

where t0(x) is given in (2.11) and y mens co-ordinates on r1,8. we insert this function
into (3.14) and we will analyse various constraints as in previous case. the analysis
is almost the same as before with dierence in point x = 0, where new phenomena
arise. as in previous part, in point, where t = t0, the system must be equivalent to

16

the supersymmetric vacuum, which again leads to the breaking of gauge eld as in
form (3.6). this leads to following results:

trdxt dxt = trn t 2

v 2(x) + 2(t (y)

d(x)

dx

+ (a9t  t a9)(x))2

where we use of gauge elds in the form

am =   am 0

0 am !

(4.4)

(4.5)

where a9  x. now as in ordinary qft, we can take 2(x)  (x) and in the
same way ( d(x)
dx . then in the second term in (4.4) are expressions, that are
proportional to d(x)
leading after putting into integral to the results:
dx

dx )2  d(x)

z (....)

d(x)

dx

dx = z d(...)

dx

(x) = 

d(...)
dx |x=0

but from the requirement, that derivation of any massless eld in point x = 0 is
zero, we see, that contribution of these terms is zero( in the following, we will write
x instead x9, only in situation, where gamma matrices will be presented, we use x9.).
as a result, we obtain from (4.4):

(ntv + 2trnk(xt  t x)(xt  t x))(x)
where for simplicity t means t (y). in the same way, we obtain:

(4.6)

(4.7)

dt (x, y) = 


0
dt

dt

0 
 (x)

where we have dened dt = dt + at  t a, dt = dt + at  t a. as a result,
we obtain
(4.8)

trdtdt  = 2trnk( dt  dt )(x)

now we comes to the analysis of potential. this potential has form:

v (t ) = m2tr(t 2) + tr(t 4) + tr(t0)4

(4.9)

having property v (t0) = 0. we see, that in points x 6= 0, this potential is zero. for
points around x = 0, we must return to the (2.11), where we now must remember,
that this solution is express as limit of function cx, where c goes to innity. this
means, that in point x = 0, we have t0 = 0.(remember, that this same is true in
function f (t ) in interaction between fermions and tachyon, but we demand contin-
uous functions of massless elds, so when r is zero in all point except x = 0, is zero
in point x = 0 as well). we see, that in point x = 0 the solution in(4.3) is :

0 !
t (x = 0) =   0 t (y)

t (y)

(4.10)

17

(we must remember, that this solution is formally multiplied (0). when we insert
(4.10) into (4.9), we obtain:

v = 2(m2trnk(t t ) + trnk(t t )2)(x)

(4.11)

we have multiplied this potential with delta function, because in all points except
x = 0 this is zero and in point x = 0 there is a delta function coming from non-
diagonal terms in (4.3). from this reason we can neglect constant term in (4.9),
because this is nite.

as a last step we arrive to the terms with fermions in (3.14). as in previous
section, for t = t0 we obtain, that diagonal terms in r are zero: a, d = 0, and in
l the non-diagonal terms are zero: f, g = 0. by requirement of continuously, these
elds are zero in point x = 0 as well. as a result, after inserting (4.10) into (3.14)
we obtain for fermionic terms in the point x = 0:

f (t )

0 !  0 c

f (t )

trf (t )rl =   0

0 g! =
= (cid:16)trnk(f (t )be) + trk(f (t )ch)(cid:17) (x)

b 0 !  e 0

(4.12)

as in case of non-diagonal terms of fermions in previous section, we can show from
transformation law for tachyon on original system of n non-bps branes, that this
remaining tachyon eld transforms under u(n  k)  u(k) as :

t  gt h1, g  u(n  k), h  u(k)

then can be easily prove, that terms in (4.12) are invariant under u(n  k)  u(k)
gauge transformations.(under this transformation, we have: e  geg1, hhh1, c 
hcg1, b  gbh1f (t )  gf (t )h1, g  u(n  k), h  u(k), so that invariance is
evident.)

from string theory point of view, this is interaction term, that we would expect
from interaction between string starting and ending on brane and string starting
on brane and ending on antibrane. first term in (4.12)reproduces this interaction.
t ij corresponds to string starting on i-th brane and ending on j-th antibrane, c jk
corresponds to the string starting on antibrane and ending on brane and eki comes
from string starting and ending on brane. then we make trace over this factor and
we obtain precisely interaction as we can expect from string theory. we than can
say, that rst term correspond to the interaction on brane and the second to the
interaction on antibrane. when we write all terms (4.4, 4.8, 4.11, 4.12) together, we
obtain function f , that contain delta function (x). now when we insert this term
into action for n 9-branes in (2.2), we obtain result:

(4.13)

where we have made exchange e  , h  .

we propose, that this action is correct action for system of n d8-branes and
n  k anti d8-branes. of course, we also expect, that this action is correct action
for lower dimensional system of branes and antibranes. we can see, that this action
leads to the action for distinguishable branes and antibranes as was presented in
literature in case, when we expand bracket (1 + 1
4) and neglect all terms containing
products of terms from rst bracket with terms from the second bracket, which can
be schematically written as:

s = z (1 +

1
4

)(f 2 + ...)( dt 2 + ...)  

1

4 z (f 2 + ...) z ( dt 2...)

v , from this fact we can obtain value of tv. we know, that in unit 2l2

action (4.13) reduces in case k = 0 to the action describing n d8-branes, because
than tachyon eld t is zero and the second bracket in (4.13) reduces to the term
nt 2
s = 1,
tension of non-bps brane is c = 2g 14 and from requirement that resulting action
describes n d8 branes, so that resulting tension is t = n/g, so we obtain condition
for vacuum value of tachyon tv:

2nt 2

v

g

=

v =

2

(4.14)

we can take special case, where action (4.13) describes one brane and one an-
tibrane. then the gauge group on brane+antibrane system is u(1)  u(1). firstly,
we can ask, what happen for case t = t0, where t0 is now minimum of tachyon
potential appearing in (4.13).the vacuum value is |t0|2 = t 2
2 . for constant
tachyon, all derivates are zero and we can deduce from second bracket of (4.13)
function, from which we obtain equation of motion for tachyon:

v = m2

f = 2t 2

v + 2((xt  t x)2 + (at  t a)2 + v (t )) + f (t )(f ermions...)

14we do not include into tension of brane various powers of .

(4.15)

19

where the last term contains fermions, but we do not need its precise form. then
equation of motion for constant t reduce to :

df
dt

= 0  t ((x  x)2 + (a  a)2) +

dv
dt

+

df (t )

dt

(....) = 0

(4.16)

we would like to evaluate this equation in point, where t = t0. then derivation of
potential is zero for this value of tachyon from the fact, that vacuum value of t is
value minimalising potential. because t is nonzero, we obtain solution of equation
of motion in form x = x, a = a. first condition has consequence, that brane and
antibrane in t0 coincide, which we can expect from the fact, that between brane and
antibrane is attractive force. the second condition means, that gauge elds must be
the same, which again means, that there is no charge for lower dimensional brane.
the last thing is case of fermions. because f (t ) is odd function, its derivation is even,
we can expect, that is nonzero for t = t0. then in order to obey equation of motion,
the fermionic term must be zero, so that all spinor elds must be zero in point, where
15. we arrive to the conclusion, that in this point supersymmetric vacuum
t = t0
is recovered. we would like also, that action in this point is zero. we see, that all
terms in f are zero except 2t 2
v + 2v (t ). vanishing of this term leads to the second
condition for vacuum value of tachyon, that has a form:

v (t0) = t 2

v  m4 = 22

(4.17)

in the following examples we will show, that this action correctly reproduces
some properties of system of branes and antibranes, that are expected on general
grounds, and conrm the conclusion, that this action is correct action for system of
branes and antibranes.

4.1 kink solution on pair d8-brane d8-antibrane

now we will construct kink solution for tachyon on pair d8-brane d8-antibrane.
we use action given in (4.13) for special value of n = 2, k = 1. then expression
in second bracket in (4.13) has a form(we will be interested mainly in the second
bracket, because only this part contains tachyon.):

(2t 2

v + 2(xt  t x)2 + 2(dt dt + v (t )) +
+f (t )b + f (t )c)

(4.18)

as was argued in previous part, we expect, that this term is zero in point, where
t = t0 is a vacuum value of tachyon. we return more carefully to the term contain-
ing fermions. because f (t0) is nonzero, we obtain some condition for them. first

15this conclusion is not precisely correct and right form will be given in the next example.

20

possibility is c = b = 0 ,but this it too restrictive and do not leads to the interesting
interaction, as we will see. we expand b = c in the form: c = x + iy, b = c,
because they are complex(this property is reection of oriented string.), while , 
are real (this is due to the fact, that u(1) has not adjoin representation.). then we
get:

f (t0)c0 + f (t0)b0 = 0  f (t0)x0( + ) + if (t0)y (  ) = 0

(4.19)

this equation can be solved with choosing

 = , x = 0

together with conditions x = x, a = a.

we take tachyon eld in the form:

t (x, y) = t (x) +

it (y)(x)

2

(4.20)

(4.21)

where x = x8 and y are remaining co-ordinates. the factor 1/2 has been taken
in order to obtain correct form of kinetic term for tachyon. we choose t (x) in the
form of kink solution as in (2.11), that is also zero in point x = 0, and t (y) is real
function of y. the analysis in point outside is similar as before and leads to the
previous conditions on massless elds. due to the condition a = a, that must hold
everywhere, the covariant derivate in point x = 0 leads to the ordinary derivate.
then we obtain as in previous case (in the following, we take x = x8 and  = 0, ...7
and again terms with derivate of delta function give zero contributions) :

dt dt = (x)t 2

v +

1
2

t (y)t (y)(x)

(4.22)

with using the condition (4.17), we see, that constant term cancels with potential
except the point x = 0, where its contribution is very small with respect to the delta
function. in point x = 0, t (x) = 0, so that potential has a form:

v (t ) =

1
2

(m2t (y)2 +


2

t (y)4)(y)

(4.23)

the last thing is term with fermionic interaction. at point x = 0 this can be written
as:

(if (t (y))iy 0  if (t (y)(iy 0)(x) = 2f (t (y))y 0

(4.24)

where we have used the fact, that f is real function and where we have included factor
 12 into denition of f function. when we remember, that y comes from right
handed sector in original conguration and  comes from left handed sector, than we
can rename these fermions as y  r,   l, then we obtain nal expression:

2f (t (y))(rl)(x)

(4.25)

21

gluing (4.22, 4.23, 4.25) together, we obtain nal result from bracket containing

tachyon eld:

(m2t 2 +

t 4) + f (t )rl) (x)

(4.26)

we can see immediately intriguing similarity with term (2.7, 2.10). which can
suggests, that this construction leads to lower dimensional non-bps d-brane. this
will be seen also from analysis the rst bracket in (4.13).

we know, that eld theory on brane and antibrane has gauge symmetry u(1) 
u(1), so that eld strength is abelian and scalar elds and fermionic elds do not
couple to the gauge elds, because u(1) group has not adjoin representation, which
also leads to the absence all interaction terms between massless elds. first bracket
also contain term bm dm b, (m = 0, ...8), that reduce due to the condition a =
a into bb, where we have used well know fact, that all massless elds are
independent on x. the next steps are straightforward. again, a8 is interpreted
as scalar eld describing uctuation in x8 direction and fm n f m n = ff  +
2x 8x 8. from the fact, that the second bracket in (4.26) contains factor 2, so
that terms for a, x, l, r are doubled, we make redenition:

2a  a, 2x  x, 2l  l,2r  r

(4.27)

so that nal result is

which is a correct action for non-bps d7-brane as proposed in [1]. as a check,
consider tachyon condensation on world-volume of this brane. for simplicity, we
take t to be equal to its vacuum value everywhere. we must determine vacuum
value of tachyon. from denition, this value minimalise potential, so we have:

dv

we see, that this value exactly cancels with constant term t 2

v , using (4.17):

t 2

v (t0) =

(4.29)

(4.30)

so that including term t 2
v /2 into potential leads to the potential with v (t0) = 0,
which is correct value of tachyonic potential for non-bps d-brane. as a further

22

check, we can proceed in the same way as in section devoted to the construction of
single brane from unstable brane. we do not mean to repeat the same calculation,
but we note only one thing. for tachyon in kink solution, the f function reduces to
the form f = t 2
2 t 4
 = 22. when we insert this into (4.28), we
the minimum of the potential: t 2
obtain action for bps d-brane with correct tension from ct 2

, where now we have from potential term : v (t ) = m2t 2 + 

0 = m2

we can also consider modding of theory with operator (1)fl, as in ref.[6]. it
was argued, that non-bps brane is invariant under this projection, so that we can
look for spectrum of low energy states in string theory living on brane. we start
with system of brane+antibrane. as is well know, strings starting and ending on
dierent branes have dierent cp matrix. we can take cp matrices in the form:

p  p =   1 0
p  p =   0 0

0 0! , p  p =   0 1
0 0!
1 0! , p  p =   0 0
0 1!

(4.31)

states, that are invariant in system brane+antibrane, are with cp matrices
i and 1, whereas states with 3 and i2 are projected out 16 we take system
brane+antibrane in iia theory. then combination t  t is projected out, which is
equivalent to the condition:

t  t = 0

when we write t = a + ib, we obtain b=0, so that tachyon is real after projection.
the same argument leads to the condition for spinor b coming from p  o sector,
results into:

leading to the result, that this spinor must be real.

from the fact, that states with 3 are odd, we have condition:

b  b = 0

a  a = 0, x  x = 0,    = 0

, so that these elds must equal. as a result, we obtain in action for system
brane+antibrane doubled number of terms for massless elds, therefore we must
redene these elds:

2a  a,2x  x,2  , t 
1 0(cid:19).
1 0(cid:19) , i2 =(cid:18) 0 1

161 =(cid:18) 0 1

t

23

(we have scaling in tachyon and other elds to obtain kinetic terms with standard
normalisation)as well as b  l, because modding with (1)fl leads to the trans-
formation of iia to iib. as a result, we obtain action for non-bps d-brane in iib
theory:

siib = czr1,7

(4.32)

we can again modding out this theory with (1)fl, that leads in the bulk to the
transformation of iib into iia theory. because non-bps d-brane does not carry rr
charge, it is invariant under this transformation. as was explained elsewhere [6],
that state with cp factor i are even under this projection and state with 1 are
odd. then we must take tachyon in action to be zero: t = 0, as well as: l = 0. as
a result, the last bracket in (4.32) is equal to 12
and we obtain correct tension for
bps brane:

c
2

=

1
g

and the rst term leads to the ordinary action for bps d-brane.

there is a place to explain, why we can suppose, that interaction of type g(t )ll
is zero. firstly, in order to obtain from non-bps brane bps brane by operation
(1)fl, we must pose the condition g(t = 0) = 0, in order to have f = 12 . second,
from the fact, that this analysis leads to this correct results, we should also have
condition g(t0) = 0, because when this would not be obeyed, we would have to take
l =  = r = 0. then we can suppose, that this function is zero.

we have seen, that from tachyon condensation in the form of kink solution on
world-volume of non-bps d9 branes, we have obtained action for d8-branes and
d8-antibranes. we have also seen, that further tachyon condensation on the pair
d8-brane +d8-antibrane leads to non-bps d7-brane, as can be expected on general
grounds [4, 5]. and nally, the last tachyon condensation leads to bps d6-brane. in
this step by step construction we would be able to construct the whole spectrum
bps and non-bps d-branes in iia theory, again with completely agreement with
[5]. but certainly it would be nice to have a contact with one step construction,
proposed in [5].
in the last section, we show rst step in this direction. we will
construct tachyon vortex solution on pair d8-brane+d8-antibrane.

4.2 vortex solution on pair brane+antibrane

now we proceed to the question of construction of vortex solution on system d8-
brane and d8-antibrane. the gauge theory describing this system is u(1)  u(1)

24

and action has a form:

s = czr1,7

+2m xm x + 2m xm x + 2ibm m b + 2im m  + 2im m (cid:17)

v + 2(dm t dt m + v (t ) + (xt  t x)2) + f (t )b + f (t )b0(cid:17)(4.33)

4

now we would like to construct vortex solution, where tachyon eld forms a
vortex in space r2 on world-volume of brane+antibrane pair (we divide world-volume
of this pair as r1,7 = r2  r1,5 and we take cylindrical co-ordinates in the r2 space
r, ), that has a form:

t = tvei

(4.34)

strictly speaking, the tachyon should approach to this solution in spatial innity, but
we would like solution, that is in vacuum value in the whole plane r2 except some
small region around point r = 0. equation of motion for tachyon is:

f
t

= dm dm t +

dv
dt

+

1
2

df
dt

b0 + t (x  x)2 = 0

(4.35)

and the same for t . we will make the same analysis as in previous cases of kink
solution, but there is an important dierence. in kink solution, we have specied
only real part of tachyon, so that imaginary part remained free, so we have generally
obtained non stable congurations after tachyon condensation. in vortex solution,
the tachyon is xed completely, even in point r = 0, so that there is no place for
remaining tachyon modes, so that we should expect, that we obtain stable congu-
ration following previous results [1, 5, 4] we can expect, that resulting conguration
is supersymmetric d6-brane.

as in usually, we start with points in plane r2, where tachyon is in vacuum
value. again, because tachyon vacuum value is nonzero, we obtain condition for
elds describing uctuation in 9-th direction:

x  x = 0

(4.36)

from the requirement of continuity of massless eld, this constraint must be
obeyed on the whole plane, so that brane and antibrane system has only degrees of
freedom corresponding to the transverse uctuation of the system as it would be the
single object.

now we return to the equation df
2dt

b0 (and the analogous equation for t ) in
the point, where t is in vacuum value. because these derivation is nonzero, we obtain
conditions for spinor elds (the situation is the same as in case of kink solution, so
we do not mean to go into details). due to the fact, that f is real function, we can

25

write this derivation as follows:

df
dt

= g  ih,

df
dt

= g + ih

and in the same way: b = x + iy, b = x  iy . then we obtain :

gx0( + ) + ih0(  ) + igy 0(  ) + hy 0( + ) = 0

(4.37)

it is clear, that solution of this equation is

x = 0, y = 0,  = 

(4.38)

the equation dv

implying, that spinor arising from string sector connecting brane and antibrane disap-
pears and two spinors from string sector living only on brane and antibrane combine
to one independent spinor. again, this implies existence of supersymmetric brane.
dt is zero in point |t| = t0 and in point x = 0, where we expect
tachyon eld to be zero, is zero as well, because value of tachyon t = 0 is also
minimum of potential.but in the small region around point x = 0 the behaviour of
this potential will be nontrivial, because tachyon goes from t = t0 to the t = 0,
this function must change very rapidly, so we expect, that innity from this potential
cancel the innity from derivation of tachyon, so that equations of motion are obeyed.
the last term is dm dm t = 0, that leads to the condition dm t = 0. for
 = 0, ...5, we obtain (due to the fact, that tachyon is not function of these co-
ordinates):

(a  a)t = 0  a = a

(4.39)

again we have only one independent gauge elds in this direction. for the directions
in plane r2, the situation is more subtle. because tachyon has nonzero twist, the
requirement dt = 0 leads to the condition

a  a =

1
r

and condition drt = 0 in point outside r = 0 leads to the condition ar  ar = 0.
because tachyon is xed also in point x = 0, this functions are xed in this points
as well, so we have conditions: ar  ar = 0 holding everywhere and a  a is xed
in some nontrivial way. in other word, even if the eld a  a and its derivation
is nonzero in point x = 0, this eld are not free, so that they appear in resulting
action as a constant, that can be taken out, but the nontrivial behaviour of a  a
is important in wz term, as we will see.
 = a + a are free, which leads to
the important consequence. to conclude, in order to obey equations of motion for
tachyon, we have obtained number of constraint on massless elds living on brane
and antibrane and also we have obtained the form of the second bracket in the action:

on the other hand, elds as

r = ar + ar, as

(...) = 2t 2

v (r) = 2t 2

v (x)(y)

(4.40)

26

as was pointed in previous part, the only nontrivial elds coming from gauge elds
with indexes r,  are elds as
x,y, where we again use cartesian co-ordinates in plane
r2. to explain this fact more carefully, we rewrite kinetic terms for gauge elds as
follows (we include factor 2 from (4.40)):

2(fm n f m n + f m n f m n ) = 2ff  + 2f f  +
+4fif i + 4f if i + 4fxyf xy + 4f xyf xy =
xyf axy)

jf aj) + 2(f s

xyf sxy + f a

jf sj + f a

= f s

f s + f a

f a + 2(f s

(4.41)

m = am +am , aa

where for the time being j = 8, 7 and where we have introduced combinations:
as
m = amam . this expression simplies dramaticly, when we use
previous results. firstly, factor f a
 is zero due to the condition (4.39). secondly, term
f a
j is zero as well, because contains elds, that are completely xed with tachyon
condensation and this is independent on  = 0, ..6 co-ordinates. and nally last
bracket is zero as well, because symmetric combination of eld is independent on x, y
co-ordinates as other massless elds and antisymmetric combination is completely
xed with tachyon, so that has not any dynamical eect and consequently can be
put away from the lagrangian. as a result, we obtain following kinetic term (we
rename as
x,y = xx,y and we include kinetic term for scalar uctuation in
9-th direction, which appears only in symmetric combination due to the (4.36)):

 = a, as

ff  + 2x ix jij

(4.42)

where i, j = 7, 8, 9. we can also introduce symmetric and antisymmetric combina-
tions for fermions and with using (4.38) we nd out, that only symmetric combination
survives. finally, with using the fact, that ct 2
g , we obtain action for supersym-
metric d6-brane:

v = 1

s = 

1

g zd6

(1 +

1
4

)(cid:16)ff  + 2i + 2i,jx ix j(cid:17)

(4.43)

as a next thing we must return to the wz term. we will follow ref.

[16],
where wz term for system brane+antibrane was presented. as was explained in this
paper, in case of tachyon condensation into vortex solution, the tachyon eld do not
contribute the rr charge and we obtain following coupling:

iw z = kzr1,7

c8  (ef  ef 

)

(4.44)

where k is unknown constant. when we expand the exponents, we obtain:

k

iw z = kz c7  (f  f ) +

2 z c5  (f  f )  (f + f ) +
6 z c3  (f  f )  (f  f + f  f  + f   f ) +

+

k

27

+

k

24 z c1  (f  f )  (f + f )  (f  f + f   f )

(4.45)

it is well known, that integralr (f  f ) has value 2 for tachyon vortex, so that rst

term express coupling d6-brane to the c7 form and consequently k is proportional
to rr charge of six brane (again, we do not worry about various factors of , which
can be easily found with help of dimensional analysis.).

the other terms are more subtle. the second term gives coupling: k

2 r c5(f s),

which could suggests, that resulting brane carry one half of c5 charge. the other
terms give the same results. we do not know how this solve, maybe we should use
the result in [16], where wz term for system brane and antibrane is expressed in
form of super connection.

to sum up, we have obtained action for d6-brane as a result of tachyon conden-
sation in form of vortex solution on world-volume of system d8-brane+d8-antibrane.
we have seen, that this solution carries correct value of charge for coupling with c7,
but question of charges for lower rr forms remains open.

5. conclusion

in previous parts we have seen, that we are able to construct action for all d-
branes in iia theory via tachyon condensation in the procedure named step by
step construction, which was proposed in [5]. then we have seen, that we can con-
struct lower dimensional brane in form of vertex solution on world-volume of system
brane+antibrane, which certainly could be used to construction all d-branes in iib
theory, following [4].

as a next step in this analysis, is construction more general vortex solutions
directly in world-volume of non-bps d9-branes in iia theory or in world-volume of
system d9-branes and d9-antibranes in iib theory. further it would be interesting
to study more general congurations, where d-branes are in general positions and the
congurations with branes and antibranes, that are not coincided. it would be also
interesting, following [5], to study relation between tachyon condensation and matrix
theory. it seams to us, that tachyon could have some connection with the origin of
the branes, with breaking of supersymmetry, and consequently, through construction
of d0-branes and their using in matrix theory, with m theory and holography.

as the last thing we must say a few words about wz terms. we have seen, that
for tachyon condensation on n non-bps d9-branes, we obtain wz term, correspond-
ing to the dierence of wz terms for d8-branes and d8-antibranes. this is certainly
a good result, but seams to us, that there is still something missing, because insta-
bility of resulting conguration does not appear in this term. as a result, through
further tachyon condensation on this system, we obtain unstable non-bps d7-brane

28

and from our analysis was clear, that this brane does not carry charge of any lower
dimensional rr form. again, in some sense this is correct result, because non-bps
d-brane does not carry rr charge, but we know, that further tachyon condensation
leads to stable bps d-brane, but due to the absence of coupling between tachyon
and rr form, we cannot obtain coupling between bps brane and rr form. in other
words, we do not see relation between wz term proposed in [16] and in [11]. better
understanding of this relation could lead to the explanation, why we do not have
correct value of charges for lower dimensional branes in d6-brane, as we have seen
in the last section. we mean, that resolution of this puzzle is very important for
further analysis.
