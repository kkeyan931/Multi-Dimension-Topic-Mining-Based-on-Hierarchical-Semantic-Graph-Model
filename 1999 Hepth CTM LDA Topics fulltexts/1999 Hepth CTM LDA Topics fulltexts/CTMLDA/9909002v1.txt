abstract: the general properties of the ordinary and generalized parafermionic
algebras are discussed. the generalized parafermionic algebras are proved to
be polynomial algebras. the ordinary parafermionic algebras are shown to
be connected to the arikcoon oscillator algebras.

the study of systems of many spins is of interest in many branches of
physics. this study is in many cases facilitated through boson mapping
procedures (see [1] for a comprehensive review). some well-known examples
are the holsteinprimako mapping of the spinor algebra onto the harmonic
oscillator algebra [2] and the schwinger mapping of lie algebras (or of q-
deformed algebras) onto the usual (or onto the q-deformed) oscillator algebras
[3].

in parallel, in addition to bosons and fermions, parafermions of order p
have been introduced [4, 5] (with p being a positive integer), having the char-
acteristic property that at most p identical particles of this kind can be found
in the same state. ordinary fermions clearly correspond to parafermions with

p = 1, since only one fermion can occupy each state according to the pauli
principle. while fermions obey fermidirac statistics and bosons obey bose
einstein statistics [6], parafermions are assumed to obey an intermediate kind
of statistics, called parastatistics [6, 7, 8].the notion of parafermionic alge-
bras has been recently enlarged by quesne [9], while the relation between
parafermionic algebras and other algebras has been given in [10, 11, 12]. the
properties of parafermions and parabosons, as well as the parastatistics and
eld theories associated with them, have been the subject of many recent
investigations [13, 14]. parafermions and parabosons have also been involved
in mapping studies. a mapping of the spinor algebra onto a parafermionic
algebra has been discussed in [4, 5, 7]. mappings of so(2n), sp(2n,r), and
other lie algebras onto parafermionic and parabosonic algebras have been
studied in [7, 15], while parabosonic mappings of osp(m,n) superalgebras
have been given in [16].

recently [17] the algebras of the operators of a single spinor with xed
spin value j have been mapped onto polynomial algebras, which constitute
a quite recent subject of investigations in physics [9, 12, 18]. in polynomial
algebras the commutator of two generators does not result in a linear combi-
nation of generators, as in the case of the usual lie algebras, but rather into
a combination of polynomials of the generators. the mappings of ref.
[17]
connect the class of spinor algebras to the class of polynomial algebras.

in the present work we show that the polynomial algebras of ref.

[17],
which are connected to the single spinor algebras, are indeed examples of
either parafermionic algebras [4, 5, 7] or generalized parafermionic algebras
[9, 12].

let us start by dening the algebra a[p]

n , corresponding to n parafermions
of order p. this algebra is generated by n parafermionic generators bi, b
i ,
where i = 1, 2, . . . , n, satisfying the trilinear commutation relations:

mi = mb
k,
where mk is an operator dened by:

hmk, b

[mk, bm] = mbk,

mk =

1

2 (cid:16)hb

k, bi + pk(cid:17) .

(1)

(2)

from this denition it is clear that eq.
relation relating three of the operators b

(1) is a trilinear relation, i.e. a
i , bi. finally the denition of the

2

parafermionic algebra is completed by the relation:

[bi, [bj, bk]] = hb

i ,hb

j, b

kii = 0.

(3)

each parafermion separately is characterized by the ladder operators b
i and bi
and the number operator mii. the basic assumption is that the parafermionic
creation and annihilation operators are nilpotent ones:

(b)p+1 = (cid:16)b(cid:17)p+1

= 0.

(4)

in ref. [10] it is proved that the single parafermionic algebra is a generalized
oscillator algebra [19], satisfying the following relations (for simplicity we
omit the parafermion indices):

hm, bi = b,

[m, b] = b,

bb = [m] = m (p + 1  m) ,

bb = [m + 1] = (m + 1) (p  m) ,

m (m  1) (m  2) ... (m  p) = 0.

(5)

(6)

(7)

the denition (2)  or equivalently eq. (6)  implies the commutation rela-
tion:

hb, bi = 2(m  p/2).

(8)

the above relation combined with (5) suggests the use of the parafermions
as spinors of spin p/2

s+  b, s  b, so  (m  p/2).

(9)

the cayley identity is also valid:

p/2

yk=p/2

(so  k) = 0.

it is worth noticing that in the case of parafermions the commutation
relation (8) is some how trivial because it is inherent in the denition of the
number operator (2). this relation switches the trilinear commutation rela-
tions to ordinary commutation relations, where two operators are involved.

3

in contrast, in the case of parabosons this construction is not trivial, be-
cause anticommutation relations are involved in the denition of the number
operator[14].

we start now examining in detail the connection between spinors with

j = p/2 and parafermions of order p.

the p = 1 parafermions coincide with the ordinary fermions, i.e.

the

usual spin 1/2 spinors [20].

for spinors with j = 1 chaichian and demichev [17] use the following

mapping

where

2a,

s+ 

2a,

s 

a3 = a3

aa + a2

= 0,
a2 = 1.

using the above two relations we can dene the number operator n

this number operator satises the linear commutation relations:

n = 1  ha, ai = aa + a2

a2.

(10)

(11)

(12)

(13)

hn, ai = a,

[n, a] = a.

the self-contained commutation relations for the p = 2 parafermions are

given in ref. [7] (eqs (5.13) to (5.20) )
b3 = b3

= 0,
bbb = 2b,
bb2 + b2b = 2b.

(14)
(15)
(16)

the set of relations (14)(16) imply the following denition of the number
operator m:

m =

1

2 (cid:16)hb, bi + 2(cid:17) .

(17)

the set of relations (11)(12) imply relations (14)(16) after taking into

consideration the correspondence:

a =

1
2

b,

a =

1
2

b.

(18)

for example one can easily see the following:

4

a) eq. (14) occurs trivially from eq. (11).

b) eq. (15) is obtained by multiplying eq. (12) by a on the right and

using eq. (11).

c) eq. (16) is obtained by multiplying eq. (12) by a on the left and using

eq. (11) and (12).

in ref.

[10] the parafermionic algebra (14)(17) was shown to be equiv-
alent to the deformed oscillator algebra [19], which is dened by relations
(4)(7), for p = 2. this deformed oscillator algebra satises in addition the
relations (11) to (13). therefore the chaichian - demichev polynomial alge-
bra (11)(13), the p = 2 parafermionic algebra (14)(17) and the deformed
oscillator algebra (4)(7) are equivalent.

relations (12) and (13) indicate that aa and n can be expressed as a
ak. this is the reason the algebra

linear combination of monomials (cid:16)a(cid:17)k

described by eqs (12)(13) is called in [17] a polynomial algebra.

what we have just seen is that the polynomial algebra (11)(13) is in
fact the p = 2 parafermionic algebra (14)(17). the new result which arises
from this discussion is that the parafermionic algebra can be written as a
polynomial algebra through the r.h.s of eq.
it seems that this fact
has been ignored, while the dual relation, giving bb or bb as polynomial
functions of the number operator,

(13).

bb = m(3  m),

bb = (m + 1)(2  m),

is known [9, 10, 11].

for spinors with j = 3/2 chaichian and demichev [17] use the following

mapping

where

s+ 

3a+, s 

3a,

(19)

(20)

(21)

(22)

(23)

aa = 1 +

1
3

a2

a4 = a4
2
a2 
3

ha, ai = 1 

a3,

= 0,
a3

3

n.

5

the last two equations imply the following expansion of the number operator:

n = aa +

a2

a2 + a3

a3.

1
2

(24)

these relations are the analogues of eqs. (11)(13) for the j = 3/2 case.

the complicated self-consistent commutation relations for the p = 3
parafermionic algebra are given in appendix b of ref.
[7]. after long but
straightforward calculations the p = 3 parafermionic relations are deduced
from the above eqs (21)(24) by taking into account the correspondence:

a =

1
3

b,

a =

1
3

b.

(25)

therefore the polynomial algebra (21)(24) is in fact the p = 3 parafermionic
algebra. the new result which again arises from this discussion is that the
parafermionic algebra can be written as a polynomial algebra through eq.
(24), while the dual relation

bb = m(4  m),

bb = (m + 1)(3  m),

is again already known [10].

stimulated by the above results we can show the following proposition:

proposition 1 the j = p/2 spinor algebra {s, so} is mapped onto the p-
parafermionic algebra {b+, b, m} which is a polynomial algebra given by the
relations:

(26)

hm, bi = b,
[m, b] = b,
bp+1 = (cid:16)b(cid:17)p+1

= 0,

bb = m (p + 1  m) = [m] ,

bb = (m + 1) (p  m) = [m + 1] ,

m = 1

2 (cid:16)hb, bi + p(cid:17) ,

where the number operator m is given by the following polynomial relation

m =

p

xk=1

ck
pk bk

bk.

6

(27)

with the factorial [k]! being dened as

[0]! = 1,

[n]! = [n] [n  1]! =

n

y=1

[] =

n!p!
(p  n)!

,

the coecients c1, c2, . . . , cp can be determined from the solution of the sys-
tem of equations:

(1) = 1
(2) = 2
. . .
(p) = p

where

(n) =

n

xk=1

ck
pk

(n + 1)

(n  k + 1)

this is true because we can see that

(28)



(p + k  n + 1)

(p  n + 1)

.

bk

bk =

k1

y=0

[m  ] 

(m + 1)

(m  k + 1)

(p + k  m + 1)

(p  m + 1)

.

the fact that the number operator of a parafermionic algebra can be written
as a combination of monomials, i.e. eq.
(27), was not previously known
in the context of parafermionic algebras. the polynomial expressions as in
eq. (27) are similar to the ones used for the construction of the projection
operators in the case of the su(2) algebra [21, 22]. the projection operator
method has also been used in the case of the suq(2) and suq(1,1) algebras [23]
as a dynamic tool for the calculation of the clebsch-gordan coecients. on
the other hand the parafermionic algebra is a nite dimensional realization
of the su(2) algebra, coinciding with the spinor algebra.

the analytic calculation of the coecients ck can be achieved by expand-

ing the number operator m in a sum over the projection operators

in the following way:

pm |ni = nm |ni

m =

p

xm=1

mpm

7

the projection operator po to the lowest weight eigenvalue is given by the
expression:

dk (cid:16)b+(cid:17)k

bk,

p

po =

xk=0

while

pm =

1

[m]! (cid:16)b+(cid:17)m

pobm =

1

[m]!

pm

xk=0

dk (cid:16)b+(cid:17)k

bk,

where the coecients dn are given by the recurrence formula

d0 = 1,
dn = 
then the general solution is given by:

n1

pk=0

dk
[nk]!.

dn =

n

xi=1

x

0 < k1, k2, . . . , ki  n
k1 + k2 + . . . + ki = n

1

[k1]! [k2]! . . . [ki]!





(29)

we must point out that these formulae are not specic to the chosen
parafermion structure function [x] = x(p + 1 x) and can be applied for any
parafermionic oscillator stucture function.
the number operator m can be expressed using the projection operators:

p

p

xk=1
while the coecients cn can be fould to be

mpm =

xm=1

m =

pk (cid:16)b+(cid:17)k

bk,

cn = pn

n

xk=1

k
[k]!

dnk.

in table 1 the coeents up to p = 5 are explicitly given.

one must notice that the parafermionic algebra (57) has anities with
the arik  coon q-deformed algebra [27], which is dened by the relations:

[n, a] = a,

[n, a] = a,

aa = [n]q,

aa = [n + 1]q

where [x]q = (1  qx)/(1  q). the generators of this oscillator satisfy the
following commutation relation

[a, a] = qn

(31)
by dening q = exp[ ] the commutation relation (31) can be written, for
  0 as
(32)

[a, a] = exp[ n] = 1   n + o( 2)

after comparing the above equation with equation (8), we can see that there
is a approximative mapping of the parafermionic oscillator to the arik 
coon oscillator by putting

arik  coon  para fermi
p a

 p a

=

b
b
m


n
2/p

the meaning of the order p of the parafermionic oscillator is quite clear, p
is a the capacity of the oscillator, i.e. the maximum number of permitted
states, which can be found similtaneously at the same position. therefore,
the parameter q of the arik  coon oscillator is a measure  of the simil-
taneously existed states at the same position.

a nice example is the case of the j = 0 pairing of nucleons in a closed
nuclear shell. the algebra of the fermion pairs coupled to angular momentum
zero are descibed by the algebra [1]:

ha0, a+

0 i = 1  nf /,

(cid:20) nf

2

, a+

0 (cid:21) = a+
0 ,

(cid:20) nf

2

, a0(cid:21) = a0

9

where nf is the number of fermions, 2 = 2j + 1 is the size of the shell, i.e.
the capacity of our space. the simplest piring hamiltonian is given by:

h = ga+

0 a0

for the above algebra there is a natural mapping to parafermions of order
p, each parafermion corresponds to a fermi pair [28] and p = . the ordinary
q-deformed oscillator [3] fails to give an approximation of the pairing model,
while the arik  coon oscillator is quite satisfactory [29].

conclusions the parafermionic algebras can be considered as polynomial
algebras, their diagonal number operator mii being able to be written as
a combination of monomials of the ladder operators. the general problem
of nding an expression of the number operator mij as a combination of
monomials of the ladder operators is still open. a similar problem exists
in quonic algebras [24, 25, 26]. work in this direction is in progress. the
arik  coon deformed oscillator is a fair approximation of the parafermionic
algebra.
