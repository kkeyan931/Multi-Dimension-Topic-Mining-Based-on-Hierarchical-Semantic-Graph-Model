abstract

we compute the one-loop holomorphic eective action of the massless cartan sector of n = 2
sym theory in the coulomb branch, taking into account the contributions both from the charged
hypermultiplets and o-diagonal components of the gauge supereld. we use the manifestly
supersymmetric harmonic superelds diagram techniques adapted to n = 2 supersymmetry
with the central charges induced by cartan generators. the (anti)holomorphic part proves to
be proportional to the central charges and it has the generic form of seibergs action obtained
by integrating u (1)r anomaly. it vanishes for n = 4 sym theory, i.e. the coupled system of
n = 2 gauge supereld and hypermultiplet in the adjoint representation.

introduction

quantum calculations in n = 2 and n = 4 super yang-mills (sym) theories within the n = 2
harmonic superspace (hss) approach [1, 2] were a subject of several recent studies [3]-[12]. the
main advantage of the hss approach is that it oers a unique opportunity to keep manifest o-shell
n = 2 susy at all steps of computation (as distinct, e.g., from the n = 1 supereld techniques).
it also allows to clearly see that the genuine n = 2 susy in the coulomb branch of n = 2
gauge theory (including matter hypermultiplets) [13] is the central charge-extended n = 2 susy,
with the central charges induced by non-zero vacuum values of the diagonal (cartan) components
of the gauge supereld [5, 6]. these vacuum values simultaneously trigger a spontaneous breaking
of gauge symmetry down to its cartan torus, producing bps masses for all superelds with non-
trivial charges with respect to the cartan generators, including o-diagonal components of the gauge
supereld. this modication of n = 2 susy implies that in the course of quantum computations
in n = 2 gauge theories in the coulomb branch one should use the hss techniques (propagators,
etc) pertinent just to the central charge-extended case. they are a proper generalization of the
quantum hss methods worked out in [1, 2] for ordinary n = 2 susy.

in [5] these techniques were applied to compute the leading contributions to the low-energy
wilsonian eective action of hypermultiplets minimally coupled to u (1) gauge supermultiplet.
the hypermultiplets acquire bps masses on account of non-zero vacuum values of the gauge su-
pereld which induce central charges in n = 2 superalgebra. the hss quantum computation with
the central charge-massive hypermultiplet propagator showed that the leading term is uniquely
dened as an integral over the analytic harmonic superspace with the quartic self-coupling of
the hypermultiplet superelds as the lagrangian density. this gives rise to an interesting con-
sequence for the physical bosonic elds of the hypermultiplet: their metric ceases to be at and
is quantum-mechanically deformed into a non-trivial hyper-kahler metric.
it is the taub-nut
metric in the case of one hypermultiplet, or its higher-dimensional generalizations in the case of
few hypermultiplets. simultaneously, a scalar elds potential arises. the same approach was used
in [6] to demonstrate the central-charge origin of the seiberg-type [14] perturbative holomorphic
contributions to the eective action of gauge supereld in the same system of u (1) gauge super-
multiplet interacting with charged hypermultiplets. once again, these contributions were found to
be proportional to the central charges of n = 2 superalgebra, viz. vacuum values of u (1) gauge
superelds1. thus, the same mechanism of non-zero central charges proves to be responsible for
the two types of analytic contributions to the low-energy eective action in the coulomb branch:
the complex-analytic (holomorphic) ones in the gauge elds sector and the harmonic-analytic ones
in the hypermultiplet sector. it is the quantum hss approach that makes manifest the common
origin of these two dierent sorts of the analytic corrections.

in all these studies, only contributions of charged hypermultiplets were taken into account,
i.e. the gauge theory was assumed to be abelian. on the other hand, it is natural to start from
the full non-abelian n = 2 gauge theory and to take account of the contributions of the charged
components of the gauge supereld itself, along with those of hypermultiplets. the appearance
of the holomorphic eective action for the massless cartan gauge superelds in the pure n = 2
sym theory (as well as non-holomorphic corrections to it) in the hss approach was discussed in
[12] using the background elds method [4]. it would be of interest to compute these contributions
directly, by the same methods as in [5, 6], i.e. by treating the central charge-massive o-diagonal
components of the gauge supereld on equal footing with the massive hypermultiplets.

this is what we do in the present paper. in sect. 2, 3 we briey discuss the quantum techniques
of the central charge-extended hss in application to n = 2 sym theory. we give the relevant
lagrangians, propagators and vertices and demonstrate that at one loop only three-linear vertex

1this calculation was rstly made within the standard quantum hss approach, by treating non-zero vacuum value

of the gauge supereld as a perturbation [3].

from the innite sequence of n = 2 sym vertices should actually be taken into account while
computing the holomorphic part of the eective action. then, in sect. 4, choosing for simplicity
su (2) as the gauge group, we calculate the one-loop holomorphic correction to the action of the
neutral component of the gauge supereld. it comes from the box-type diagrams with the neutral
component on the external legs and the massive charged components (together with the charged
components of the faddeev-popov ghosts) running inside. the answer coincides with the seibergs
eective action obtained in [14] by integrating u (1)r anomaly. we compare it with the contribution
of q-hypermultiplet in the adjoint representation and nd both to cancel each other, in agreement
with the absence of holomorphic terms in the eective action of n = 4 sym to which this n = 2
system amounts (actually, this is a modied n = 4 sym theory, with a central-charges extended
n = 4 susy). the calculations can be easily generalized to an arbitrary semi-simple gauge group.
the corresponding holomorphic contribution is given by a sum over positive roots in the spirit of
refs. [15]. in two appendices some technical points are treated. in particular, we check that our
results are independent of the choice of  -gauges in the massive gauge supereld propagators.

we shall concentrate on the rst term in (2.1) which is the pure n = 2 sym action. let c be

the cartan subgroup of the gauge group g. we shall use the decomposition

(c) takes values in the lee algebra of c and v ++

where v ++

here w0, w0 are some constants (moduli) with values in the lee algebra of c. this corresponds to
the coulomb branch of the theory, with the original gauge symmetry being spontaneously broken
down to that with respect to the cartan subgroup. the leading terms of the cartan subalgebra
valued supereld strengths w(c)  w(c)w0 , w(c) are expressed through the potential v ++

full such strengths include, of course, nonlinear terms  ev ++

g/c  v ++. in our computation of the
cartan subgroup sector of the eective action of n = 2 sym we shall be interested only in such
leading terms, assuming that the full strengths are restored by non-abelian gauge invariance.

the non-vanishing background supereld v++ triggers the spontaneous breakdown of g to c
and simultaneously generates constant u (1) central charges in n = 2 superalgebra [5, 17]. they
explicitly break u (1)r automorphism symmetry of the original n = 2 susy. the generators of
the central charges-modied n = 2 superalgebra are

this algebra can be interpreted as the algebra of the full covariant n = 2 sym derivatives in
a covariantly constant gauge background v++ [4, 5]. then, following [1], we can introduce the

in this frame, like in the case of ordinary n = 2 susy, one can dene the manifestly analytic
harmonic superelds which depend only on half of the original grassmann coordinates. at the
same time, the harmonic derivatives (d) necessarily contain the central-charge terms. on the
contrary, in the  -frame the above spinor derivative include the central-charge terms, while the
harmonic derivatives do not.
in this frame the harmonic analyticity is covariant. the relation

the algebra (2.7) does not depend on the choice of frame and/or basis.

the realization of n = 2 susy preserves its old form only on the cartan part of the shifted

supereld ev ++, since the latter is evidently invariant under rigid c transformations. it is modied
on all other superelds having non-trivial charges with respect to c and, hence, non-zero central
charges. all these superelds acquire bps masses by the standard scherk-schwarz mechanism.
g/c  v ++ of v ++. one of the two real g-
this concerns as well the o-diagonal component ev ++
algebra-valued physical scalar elds in it, along with the physical fermions, become massive by the
same mechanism. the remaining physical dimension scalar eld is the g/c goldstone boson and
it produces a mass for the g/c gauge elds via the higgs eect (this scalar eld fully disappears in
the unitary gauge). as a result, only the physical elds contained in v ++
remain massless (for
(c)
the gauge group g of rank r these are r complex scalar elds, r gauge elds and 2r gaugini weyl
spinors).

let us return to the n = 2 sym action (2.2).

the central-charge induced splitting (2.4) of v ++ into the massless and massive pieces ev ++
(c) 
(c) and v ++, due to the shift v++, essentially redenes the kinetic part of the action. in particular,
v ++
a mass term for the charged components v ++ is generated (this phenomenon is analogous to the
central-charge modication of the free q+ action, see ref. [5, 6]). the precise form of the split action
can be found using the fact that the redenition (2.4) and the relations (2.9) are a particular case
of the splitting of v ++ into the quantum and background parts within the n = 2 background elds

method [4], with v++ and ev ++ playing the roles of the background and quantum parts. then,

following [4], we rewrite (2.2) as

(2.11)

first two terms in (2.11) are of no relevance for the further consideration and can be omitted

(actually, the second term is zero as a consequence of the manifest analyticity of ev ++ and the fact

that v++, v are dened on the commutative cartan subalgebra). this resulting form of n = 2 sym
action is the convenient starting point for constructing full quantum version of the central-charge
modied theory.

the faddeev-popov-thooft procedure changes insignicantly for the massive case as compared
to the case of pure massless v ++ worked out in [2]. the main dierence is related to the systematic
use of the algebra of the centrally-extended covariant derivatives (2.7). following the same steps
as in [2], the gauge-xed quadratic part of the split n = 2 sym action, together with the faddeev-
popov ghosts part, can be written as (for the standard -gauges)

valued superelds. the latter has the same form as that of v ++, but with taking the purely at
expressions for the box operator and spinor derivatives (with no terms  w0, w0 producing mass
for v ++). notice the appearance of the index  in the fp action: the ghost superelds f and p

4

are in the adjoint representation like ev ++ and therefore their o-diagonal components acquire non-

trivial central charges and become massive like the charged q+ hypermultiplets. we also note that,
though ( v ++) , f , p are covariantly analytic, the integrands in (2.12) are manifestly analytic:
this is because they are invariant under the global g symmetry and, hence, are the central charge
singlets.

the full microscopic quantum action for the central-charges extended system of n = 2 sym
and hypermultiplet superelds can be obtained as a sum of (2.12), the self-interaction n = 2 sym
part and the hypermultiplet action

it is easy to show that action (2.13) is invariant under the appropriate brst transformations which
replace the gauge ones in the quantum case. these are a straightforward extension of those for the
massless case [2].

in what follows we shall be interested in the leading contributions to that sector of the one-
loop n = 2 sym eective action which contains only the massless sym superelds v ++
(c) . as we
shall show, such contributions can come only from the diagrams containing the three-linear vertices
(c) , only the massive charged v ++
(3.7) (see fig. 2). clearly, when the external legs are massless v ++
superelds with the propagators (3.1) can run inside. thus the sector of n = 2 sym eective
action we are interested in is dened by the expression analogous to that dening the contribution
from the charged q+ hypermultiplets [6], namely, by

[v ++

(c) ] = i tr ln{(4,2)

a + v ++
(c)

g(2,2)} .

(3.9)

here (4,2)(1|2)a is the appropriate analytic delta-function and g(2,2)(1|2) is given by (3.2). notice
that (v ++
(c) and the bridge v (they both

in view of commutativity of v ++

(c) ) = (v ++

(c) ) = v ++

(c)

belong to the cartan subalgebra).

let us argue that the leading holomorphic part of the n = 2 sym eective action in the
considered sector can indeed come only from the diagrams on fig. 2, with the three-linear vertices.

the generic argument is as follows.
for a xed number of the external v ++
(c)

legs any other one-loop diagram apart from those on fig.
2, i.e. a diagram including some number of higher-order n = 2 sym vertices (of the type depicted
on fig. 1), contains not enough spinor derivatives to produce the (anti)holomorphic contributions
in the local limit (after restoring the full grassmann integration measures at the vertices).

this important property can be proved in the general case, but it is instructive to rstly illustrate
it on a simple example. the simplest diagram of the above type includes two v ++ propagators,
one three-linear and one quartic vertices, but its contribution is vanishing by the purely algebraic
reason related to the properties of the gauge group structure constants. so we explain the above
argument on the example of the supergraph depicted on fig. 1.
it could give a non-vanishing
contribution to the quartic term of the eective action.

(3.12)

recalling the denition of the abelian sf strengths (2.5), we see that one needs at least eight
spinor derivatives to form these objects from the four gauge potentials in (3.12), while only four
such derivatives are present in (3.12). thus we conclude that no any local holomorphic (anti-
holomorphic) contribution can be produced by the above supergraph.

in the generic case, every additional external line at some vertex of the given supergraph
demands two extra spinor derivatives for this diagram be capable to produce a holomorphic term

7

in the local limit. such derivatives can be taken o only from the propagators. so, for obtaining
a holomorphic contribution there should be a strict relation between the numbers of external lines
and propagators. a simple analysis shows that these numbers should be equal, which selects the
diagrams on fig. 2 as the only source of holomorphic contribution from the pure n = 2 sym to
the cartan sector of the eective one-loop n = 2 sym action.

4 one-loop holomorphic contribution to the sym eective

action

for simplicity, we rstly choose su (2) as the gauge group, with v ++
3 t3. the
techniques suitable for calculating n-particle holomorphic corrections to the eective action in the
case of n = 2 susy with constant background central charges were worked out in [6]. although
the consideration in [6] was limited to the abelian u (1) theory and to the supergraphs with q+
hypermultiplets inside, it can be easily extended to our case. this is mainly due to the property
that for extracting the holomorphic contributions it is sucient to consider the diagrams depicted
in fig. 2. the only complication compared to the hypermultiplet case is the presence of harmonic
non-localities in the pure n = 2 sym vertices.

(c) being simply v ++

so, in the n = 2 sym sector (with no hypermultiplets) the holomorphic contribution can come

from the diagrams on fig. 2 and those with the faddeev-popov ghosts inside (fig. 3).

the ghost contribution is given by the supergraphs on fig. 3. the sum of holomorphic and

(4.14)

the total low-energy holomorphic eective action is obtained by summing over n and making the
appropriate renormalization in the second-order term. the nal answer is as follows

w(c) = w0 + w(c) ,

322 z d 4xd4 w 2

(c) ln

w 2
(c)
m 2 + c.c. ,

(4.15)

with m being normalization scale. it coincides (up to a dierence in the conventions) with seibergs
action [14] obtained by integrating u (1)r anomaly in the pure n = 2 sym theory. the same
arguments as in ref. [6] show that the holomorphic contribution (4.15) is entirely due to non-zero
central charges and is vanishing in the limit w0 = w0 = 0 (this does not apply to the divergent
second-order correction which exists in the massless case as well [2]). the same holomorphic
contribution was found in [4] using the background elds method. in our case we calculated it using
the computation techniques manifestly covariant under n = 2 susy with the central charges.

the calculation of the hypermultiplet contribution follows the same lines as in the abelian case
[6]. here we present only the nal answer for the hypermultiplet in the adjoint representation. it
amounts to the contribution of two charged massive hypermultiplets (two o-diagonal components
of the adjoint representation of su (2)) and diers only in sign from the total contribution of the
gauge sector:

hp [v ++] = 

1

322 z d 4xd4 w 2

(c) ln

w 2
(c)
m 2 + c.c. .

(4.16)

the cancellation among the n = 2 sym and hypermultiplet contributions agrees with the absence
of holomorphic corrections to the n = 4 sym eective action in the n = 2 supereld notation
and serves a good consistency check of our computation of the n = 2 sym contribution (4.15).

10

note that in the present case we deal with a bit dierent n = 4 sym action: both manifest and
hidden n = 2 susy in it possess central charges proportional to w0, w0. they break the u (4)r
symmetry of n = 4 susy down to so(4) which is the product of the n = 2 susy automorphism
su (2) and the so-called pauli-gursey su (2) realized on the doublet indices a in (2.15).

being armed with the above techniques, we can compute the holomorphic contribution to the
n = 2 sym eective action for the case of arbitrary semi-simple gauge group g of rank r. it is
convenient to choose the standard cartan-weyl basis for its algebra g

g = n+  h  n ,

(4.17)

where h is the cartan subalgebra with the basis {hi}, i = 1 . . . r, and n+, n are the positive and
negative roots subspaces spanned by the generators e(+), e() ( are the positive (negative)
roots). for our purposes we need only the commutation relations involving the cartan generators

[hi, e()] = (i)e() ,
[hi, hk] = 0 ,
tr(hihk) = ik , tr(e(+)e()) =   .

[e(+), e()] = (i)hi ,

(4.18)

(4.19)

next we notice that all the vertices we use in our calculations can be uniformly written as follows

where

and

 tr(cid:16)[m, k]v ++

(c) , m ]k(cid:17) = tr(cid:16)m [k, v ++

(c) ](cid:17) ,

(4.20)

(c) (cid:17) = tr(cid:16)[v ++
(c) = xi

v ++

m = x

m()e(+) ,

v ++
i hi ,

k = x

k(+)e()

stand for the positive (negative) roots parts either of the faddeev-popov ghost superelds, or the hy-
permultiplet in the adjoint representation, or the massive n = 2 sym potentials v ++(1), v ++(2).
dening

and using (4.19), we represent these vertices as

v ++
() e(+)  [v ++

(c) , e(+)]

 x

m() v ++

() k(+) .

(4.21)

(4.22)

then one should take into account that only the propagators < m()(1)|k(+)(2) > appear as
the internal lines in the one-loop diagrams we are interested in, and that these propagators are
diagonal in the indices ,  (because they include only the unity matrix and the diagonal matrices
of the cartan generators). with this in mind, it is easy to nd that the full holomorphic and anti-
holomorphic correction from the sym and ghost superelds is given by the sum over the positive
roots, like in refs. [15]

y m + gh =

1

322 xn+

z d 4xd4 w 2

() ln

w 2
()
m 2 + c.c. ,

w()e(+)  [w(c), e(+)] . (4.23)

as before, the hypermultiplet contribution diers only by sign from (4.23) (once again, we spe-
cialize to the adjoint representation). thus, like in the su (2) case, we have for the n = 4 sym
holomorphic eective action

hol
n =4[v ++] = hol

hp [v ++] + hol

y m [v ++] + hol

gh [v ++] = 0 .

(4.24)

11

finally, let us make two comments.
the rst one concerns the gauge invariance of our approach. our computations are clearly
covariant under the cartan subgroup c of the full gauge group g. what concerns non-abelian
gauge g/c transformations, their sole eect seems to be rotations of the considered sector of the
full n = 2 sym eective action into other sectors, with some numbers of o-diagonal components
of the non-abelian strength as external legs. as for the internal lines, the above diagrams exhaust all
possibilities in the sector we are considering, provided that one is interested only in the holomorphic
contributions and keeps in mind the property discussed in the end of sect. 3. in appendix b we also
argue that our results cannot depend on the choice of the  gauge in the massive v ++ propagator.
our reasoning is based on an explicit calculation. an implicit argument why the full n = 2 sym
contribution should be -independent is the absence of holomorphic corrections to the n = 4 sym
action. indeed, this contribution should be cancelled by that from the q-hypermultiplet sector, but
the latter contains no any -dependence.

secondly, we wish to note that in the one-loop approximation all possible diagrams with massless
gauge superelds outside necessarily contain only massive v ++ lines inside. this follows from the
conservation of the cartan u (1) charges in the diagram and the property that among the elementary
components of v ++: any
n = 2 sym vertices there exist no those containing only cartan v ++
(c)
vertex should have at least two massive v ++. to be convinced of this, it is enough to observe that
the nominator of a generic term in the n = 2 sym self-interaction (2.14) can be rewritten through
the successive commutators as

 tr{[( v ++

1

) , [( v ++

2

) , ...., [(v ++

n2) , (v ++

n1) ]...]](v ++

n

) } .

so, all possible one-loop diagrams with the v ++
lines, and we can apply to them the general argument adduced in the end of sect. 3.

(c) external legs contain inside only the massive v ++

5 conclusions

in this paper we worked out the basic elements of the quantum hss techniques for non-abelian
n = 2 sym theory in the coulomb branch, with n = 2 susy modied by the cartan central
charges which give rise to the splitting of n = 2 sym prepotential v ++ into the massless car-
tan and massive charged g/c projections. using this approach, we calculated the holomorphic
contribution of the massive n = 2 sym superelds (and ghosts) into the eective action of the
massless projection. up to a numerical coecient, it has the same form as the contribution of
one u (1) q+ hypermultiplet computed earlier in [6] with making use of similar techniques. like
the latter, it disappears in the limit of zero central charge, thus conrming the general property
that all holomorphic perturbative one-loop contributions to the u (1) gauge superelds sector of
the quantum eective action of n = 2 sym in the coulomb branch are the entire eect of non-zero
central charge in n = 2 superalgebra (similarly to the analytic corrections to the q+ eective action
[5]). we found the explicit cancellation of the n = 2 sym contribution and that of the matter
hypermultiplet in the adjoint representation of the gauge group, thus having checked the absence of
the one-loop holomorphic corrections to n = 4 sym action. the main novelty of our approach is
the preservation of manifest n = 2 susy with the cartan central charges at all steps of quantum
calculations in non-abelian n = 2 sym theories.

it would be interesting to apply the same straightforward quantum hss techniques to computing
non-holomorphic contributions to the coulomb branch eective actions of n = 2 and n = 4 sym
theories, both in the gauge elds and hypermultiplet sectors.

appendix b

in this appendix we argue that our computations do not depend on the choice of -gauge for the
massive v ++ propagators. to this end, let us start with the full -depended propagator which is
a solution of the equation (3.1).

now we substitute this propagator into n
at the point  = 0 ( = 1)

y m (4.1) and decompose the latter in series in  =  + 1

n
y m () = n

y m + n  + . . . .

(b.3)

the idea is to show that, under the innitesimal shift of , the holomorphic (anti-holomorphic)
part of n
y m () to be
continuous in , we can state that its (anti)holomorphic local part does not depend on  at all.

y m does not change, i.e. n = 0 in the local limit. then, assuming n

we nd

(b.4)

then, following the calculations (4.1)-(4.7), we get the expression which looks very similar to (4.7),
except for the presence of an extra pair of spinor derivatives (d+

l d+

k ) in it:

(b.5)

but (4.7) already contains the critical number of spinor derivatives and the presence of two extra
ones simply means that the holomorphic (anti-holomorphic) contribution from (b.5) vanishes

n

hol = 0

(b.6)

(due to the properties (d+

 (u)v ++

(c) (u) = 0)).

we have also explicitly checked the vanishing of the holomorphic contributons in the second

order in  for the diagrams with two and three external legs.
