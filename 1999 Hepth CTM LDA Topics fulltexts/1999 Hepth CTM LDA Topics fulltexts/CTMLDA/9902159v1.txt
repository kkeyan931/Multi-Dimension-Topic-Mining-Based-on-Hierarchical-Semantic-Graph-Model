abstract

lienard-wiechert potentials of the relativistic spinning particle with anomalous magnetic

moment in pseudoclassical theory are constructed. general expressions for the lienard-

wiechert potentials are used for investigation of some specic cases of the motion of the

spinning particle. in particular the spin dependence of the intensity of the synchrotron radi-

ation of the transversely polarized particle performing uniform circular motion is considered.

when the movement of the particle in external homogeneous magnetic eld the obtained

formulae coincide with those known from quantum theory of radiation. the dependence of

the polarization of the synchrotron radiation on the spin of the particle is investigated.

1.the introduction of grassmann variables into the theory allowed to construct theories

of the point particles, which describe the spin of the particle already at the classical level

[1, 2]. these theories are known as pseudoclassical theories and are classical gauge theories

with constraints. methods for quantization of these theories are presented in [3, 4, 5]. the

possibility of consistent description of the spin in external elds using grassmann variables

already at the classical level allows to investigate spin eects in a number of physical pro-

cesses using classical equations of motion. note that description of the spin in classical

theories without grassmann variables is also possible, however these theories do not give

after quantization the accepted quantum relativistic dirac particle (see the review [6] and

references therein).

in this paper in the pseudoclassical approach the lienard-wiechert potentials for a

charged relativistic spinning particle with anomalous magnetic moment (amm) interact-

 partially supported by the grants intas 96-538, intas 93-1038 and intas-rfbr 95-0829.

ing with the external electromagnetic eld are obtained (a self-contained pseudoclassical

theory of the interaction of the spinning particle with amm with the external electromag-

netic eld was constructed in [7, 8, 9]). using these expressions for the lienardwiechert

potentials certain cases of the charged particle movement are considered. in particular the

general expressions for the spin dependence of the of the intensity and the polarization of

the synchrotron radiation on the polarization of the particle for the transversely polarized

particle performing a uniform circular motion are obtained. investigation were carried out in

quadratic approximation in the grassman variables, or, which is the same, to the rst order

in the spin, which corresponds to the quasiclassical description. in this approximation, in

the case of the movement in the homogeneous magnetic eld, the obtained formulae (when

the dependence of the eective mass of the particle on the strengt of the magnetic eld is

taken into account) coincide with similar formulae obtained in the classical radiation theory

[10], as well as with those in quantum theory [11].

it is important to stress, that within our approach the evaluation of the formulae, de-

scribing the spin dependence of the measurable characteristics of the relativistic particle

radiation is much easier, than in quantum electrodynamics.

note, that these potentials were constructed also for investigation of the problem of

(classical) renormalization of the pseudoclassical theory of the electron. the results of these

investigations will be reported in the separate paper.

this paper is organized as follows. in section 2 we describe the lagrangian of the pseu-

doclassical theory of the spinning particle with amm and the electromagnetic eld. the

equations of motion and xation of the gauges are written down, additional gauge xing con-

ditions are imposed and general expressions for the lienardwiechert potentials are given.

in section 3 the case of the particle at rest with precessing spin is considered. in section 4

the expressions for the synchrotron radiation eld strengths for the relativistic transversely

polarized spinning particle performing a uniform circular motion are deduced and the depen-

dence of the intensity and the polarization of the synchrotron radiation on the polarization

of the particle are obtained. the special case of the movement in the external homogeneous

magnetic eld is considered in details

2. thus, consider the action of the theory, describing the interaction of the relativistic

spinning particle with anomalous magnetic moment (amm) with electromagnetic eld in

the space time dimensions d = 4 [7, 8, 9]):

here x( ) is particle coordinate, , ( ) are grassmann variables, describing spin degrees

of freedom, 5( ),  and e are additional elds (e is an even element, 5 and  are odd elements
of grassmann algebra) , a is the vector-potential of the electromagnetic eld, f = a
a; g is the charge of the particle, (g)- the anomalous magnetic moment, m = 12gm/g
is the total magnetic moment of the particle in bohr magnetons; the overdote denotes the

dierentiation over  along the trajectory; the derivatives over grassmann variables are left.

the theory (1) has three physical gauge symmetries: reparametrization and super-

symmetric [8], and also the u(1) gauge symmetry of electromagnetic interactions. they

correspond to the presence of three primary constraints of the rst class in the hamiltonian

formulation of the theory. the total number of the rst-class primary constraints is equal

to ve. two of them correspond to nonphysical degrees of gauge freedom. fixation of the

latter will be accomplished below by choosing the condition  = 0 and through replacement

of e in the theory using the equation of motion for it.

to obtain the expression for lienard-wiechert potentials well write the equation for the

electromagnetic eld a and also for the elds e and :

s

a(y)

= f (y) + gz d x(x( )  y)  2igz d ( x  x)5(x( )  y) +
+ igm z d e(x( )  y)  2g2z d ef(x( )  y)

from equations (3) and (4) we nd the expressions for the auxiliary elds e and 5:

(5)

(6)

(the choice of the sign of e in the expression (5) is dictated by the positivity of the energy

in nonrelativistic limit).

expressions (5) and (6) are written for  = 0. the expansion of the right hand side

of these expressions in powers of  is carried out with taking into account the fact that

the powers of  higher than four are equal to zero. substituting in (2) e and 5 by the

expressions (5) and (6) we get the following equation for the eld a with  = 0:

(cid:16)a  a(cid:17) (y) +  2g2

further simplication of this equation is achieved by the following. let us x two of the three

physical gauges of the theory. to do this we will choose the gauge condition for the eld a

in the form a = 0, and will identify the parameter  with the proper time of the particle,

which means xation of the u(1) and reparametrization degrees of freedom correspondingly.

then we get x2 = 1. also we will consider only those terms of the equation (7), which

contain powers of  no higher than two. this limitations are equivalent to quasiclassical

approximation since after quantization of the theory the terms containing second orders of

 will be proportional to h (the terms, containing the fourth power of  will give rise to
corrections of the order of h2 [1, 2]). taking into account all this, we can rewrite the equation

(7) in the form:

a = j

4

(9)

where j is given by the expression (8). it is convenient to represent the current vector j

as a sum of two terms:

where

j(y) = gz d x(x( )  y) +



y z d (x( )  y)p( ),

p =

i
m {gm  2gm [ x  x] ( x)} ,

p = p.

(10)

(11)

the rst summand in (10) corresponds to the current of the charged particle without the

dipole moment. the second term corresponds to the contribution to the current of the dipole

moment of the spinning particle.

note that there is one more degree of freedom in the theory. we will x it by imposing

the condition



x  = 0,

(12)

which due to relation (6) is equivalent to 5 = 0. now the electric dipole moment of the

particle q, which is connected with p by the relation q = p


x  (see e.g. [12]), is equal

to zero:

q =

ig
m

(


x ) = 0,

(13)

as it should be for a point particle.

we will show now, that from the pseudoclassical expression (11) for p follows, that, as

expected, the total magnetic moment of the particle is directed along the spin of the particle.

to do this we will use the expression, connecting the magnetic moment of the particle m

with the tensor of the dipole moment p [12]:

m =

1
2




x p.

(14)

taking into account, that in the gauge  = 0 , (

x  = ep  [9] ( p = (e, ~p)
is 4-momentum of the particle ), which using (5) and dropping terms proportional to 4,


x ) = 0 we have



takes the form (for x2 = 1)



x  = p /me, me = m +

igm
2m

f .

(15)

the analog of the relation between the 4-momentum of the particle and its mass in this case
has the form of p 2
e + o()4 = 0, while the sign    in (15) is connected with the
denition of the generalized momentum, conjugated to the coordinate of the particle.

(17)

a/2 is the relativistic generalization of the pseudoclassical spin vector (after canonical quan-

tization the vector a becomes a polarization four vector of the spinning particle). from (16)

follows the proportionality of the magnetic moment of the particle to the polarization vector

with the coecient equal to the total magnetic moment of the particle.

in formulae (20) and (21) the expressions in the square brackets correspond to the con-

tribution to the a and f of the charge of the particle, while those in the parentheses

correspond to the contribution of the dipole moment.

inserting the explicit expression (11) for p in (20)-(24) we obtain the general form of

the retarded lienard-wiechert solution for the electromagnetic eld strengths of the charged

spinning particle in the pseudoclassical theory.

3. do disclose the correspondence between the obtained pseudoclassical expressions for

lienard-wiechert potentials and well known classical formulae for the strengths of the electric

and magnetic elds of the charged particle with a magnetic moment, we will consider the

case of the spinning particle at rest (


x i = 0,


x  = 

0 ) with precessing spin

from formulae (21)-(24) we nd the expression for the eld strengths of the electromag-

1 + r2

2 + r2

p0i = 0, which follows from (19). from formula (19) at ~v = 0 it also follows, that

taking into account, that in the rest frame of the particle we have [15]:

where si is the spin of the particle, we get

hence

let now the spin of the particle be precessing around certain axis with a constant angular

using (28), (31) and also the equality p0i = 0, we nd from (25) the expressions for the

electric and magnetic eld strengths for the charged particle with precessing spin (the electric
ei and magnetic bi elds are dened as ei  (f 01, f 02, f 03), bi  (f 23, f 31, f 12)):

4. here we will obtain the formulae for the electromagnetic eld strengths of synchrotron

radiation from particles in circular orbits. we will consider the case of transverse polarization

of the particle ( when the spin of the particle is perpendicular to the rotation plane). this

problem is interesting from the point of view of measuring the polarization of the particles

by the measurement of the synchrotron radiation.

it is well known, that the radiation eld is given by the terms in the expression (21),

proportional to 1/:

where ~v  (vi) = dxi/dt is the three-velocity of the particle, ~a = d~v/dt, ~b = d~a/dt, dt/d =

substituting (36) into the rst term of expression (35) for f

expression for the electric eld strength ech

ech

i =

with w  by the relation (19), we will make use of the relation between w and spin vector

from (36) with accounting for (42) we get

in the case of the uniform circular movement of the transversely polarized particle apart

sb

ijksjak = h~s,~aii

= sbvi,

(50)

where sb is the projection of the spin vector on the direction of the magnetic eld strength
~b. on account of these relations the expression (48) can be rewritten as,

which is obtained using expressions (42) and (50), we can write the expression for the syn-

chrotron radiation rate of the particle per unit solid angle d:

di

drd

= (cid:18) g

4(cid:19)2

(1  v cos )5 (cid:20)(1  v cos )2  (1  v2) sin2  cos2  + 2

m
m

sb sin2  sin2 (cid:21) ,

(54)

where  and  are the angles dening the orientation of the vector ~n in the cartesian coor-
dinate system dened by three vectors ~v,~a and ~bext(~s) (see g.1).

integrating the expression (54) over the solid angle we get for the radiation rate the

formula:

di
dr

=

g2
4

2a2

3(1  v2)2 (cid:20)1 +

m
m

sb

1  v2(cid:21) .

(55)

to compare this with the formulae obtained in quantum radiation theory, note, that the

eective mass of the particle, dened by the expression (15), in the case of motion in the

homogeneous external magnetic eld takes the form

me = m +

i
2

gm
m

fijij = m +

1
2

fijpij.

(56)

the right-hand side of the formula (56) is written on account of the relation (11) and the

gauge (12). substituting in (56) the expression for pij from (43) we nd for the me (to the

rst order in spin)

me = m + e
m

gm
m

bisi.

using (57) we obtain from (39) to the rst order in spin the relation

2n

(1  v2)n = (cid:18) e
m(cid:19)

(1  2n

m

m (cid:18) e
m(cid:19)

(57)

sb).

(58)

in deducing the last equation in (58) we used the relation gb = m. using now the equality

(58), the formula (55) can be rewritten in the form

di
dr

=

g2
4

2a2

3 (cid:18) e
m(cid:19)

4"1  3

m

sb(cid:18) e
m(cid:19)

2# .

(59)

on account of the relation s = 1

2, where  = 1 is the projection of the polarization vector
on the direction of the magnetic eld, we nd that this formula (59) coincides with that

found in the quantum theory of radiation (to the rst order in spin).

12

to investigate the characteristics of the polarization of synchrotron radiation we resolve
(following [16]) the electric eld strength ~erad into components along the vectors ~e = ~a/a

and [~n, ~e]:

~erad = e1~e + e2 [~n, ~e] ,

(60)

this choice of unit vectors is suitable for description of the radiation of the relativistic

particles using angles dened on fig.2, which are appropriate since the main contribution to
the radiation comes from small ( 1/) angles  and , in accordance with the fact, that
the angle between vectors ~n and ~v is of the order of ( 1/). as it was mentioned in [16],
the vector ~e is not orthogonal to vector ~n, however this deviation is of the order of 1/, so

that the decomposition (60) can be used for calculation of major terms (with accuracy 1/).

from formulae (37) and (52) we get according to decomposition (60) the expressions for e1

and e2:

e1 =

ga

r(2 + 2)3  (2  2) 
r(2 + 2)3   +

2ga

(2 + 2)2 ! =r

,

sb

,

(61)

(62)

where 2 = 2 + 2.

taking into account the equality (58), we rewrite the expression for 2 in the form

e (cid:19)2
2 = 2 +(cid:18)m

+ 2

m

.

(63)

substituting now the expression for 2 into (61) and (62), we get to the rst order in

spin

from obtained formulae one can see, that in the direction  = m/e of the plane (~a~v) ( = 0)
there is a radiation (proportional to the spin), contrary to the case of particle without spin.
