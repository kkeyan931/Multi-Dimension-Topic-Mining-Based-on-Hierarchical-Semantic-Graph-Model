abstract

we review a recently proposed method for constructing super-p-brane world-volume actions.
in
this approach, starting from a democratic choice of world-volume gauge-elds guided by p-brane
intersection rules, the requirements of -symmetry and gauge invariance can be used to determine
the corresponding action. we discuss the application of the method to some cases of interest, notably
the (p, q)-5-branes of type-iib string theory in a manifestly s-duality covariant formulation.

introduction

with the derivation of the -symmetric actions for the dp-branes [15] and the m5-brane [6, 7], the
programme of constructing world-volume actions for all the points on the revisited brane-scan of ref. [8]
was essentially completed by early 19971. however, the case of the ns5-brane of the type-iib theory
was not satisfactorily resolved by these eorts, and, moreover, since then a number of more or less
exotic extended objects have been predicted from a detailed analysis of the relevant supertranslation
algebras [10] and/or u-duality considerations (see ref. [11] and references therein). these facts have
provided motivation for subsequent work on completing and rening the formulations of the world-volume
dynamics for extended objects in string and m theory.

one line of further development has been the construction of manifestly s-duality covariant actions
for the bps multiplets of branes in the type-iib theory, in particular for the dyonic (p, q)-strings [12]
and for the sl(2)-singlet d3-brane [13]. this programme, whose extension to the dyonic (p, q)-5-branes
was given in ref. [14] and will be reviewed below, is based on a particular type of action in which the
brane tension is generated by an auxiliary world-volume gauge eld. more specically (leaving the issue
of sl(2) covariance aside until later), the actions we will consider are of the generic form

s = z dp+1g  [1 + ({fi})  (fp+1)2] ,

(1)

where {fi} and fp+1 denote a set of gauge-invariant abelian world-volume eld strengths, each of the
form f = da  c  {composite terms}; we generically use c to denote (the supereld extension of) a
supergravity gauge potential (here pulled back to the world-volume). moreover, the composite terms are
wedge products of lower-rank f s and cs required for gauge invariance. as indicated, the (p+1)-form
eld strength fp+1 plays a special role: the equation of motion for its non-propagating gauge potential ap
has the solution fp+1 = constant, a constant which can be identied with the tension. in addition to
ap, the action contains a second auxiliary eld, , which serves as a lagrange multiplier for the constraint
 = 1 + ({fi})  (fp+1)2  0.2
in general, the choice of brane is determined by the leading background gauge potential cp+1 appear-
ing in the tension eld strength, while the remaining world-volume gauge elds correspond to other branes
that can end on or intersect the world-volume. as we shall see, it is possible to construct covariant actions
of the type (1) in which world-volume potentials appear together with their poincare duals; the problem
of preserving the correct degree-of-freedom counting can be resolved in a rather elegant and natural way.

1for the m5-brane case, note, however, the caveat discussed in ref. [9].
2as a special case, restricting the world-volume gauge-eld content to the borninfeld eld strength f2 = da1  b2 (in
addition to the tension eld-strength) leads to an alternative formulation of the d-branes [15]. the standard formulation,
in which the action consists of the sum of a dbi and a wz term, can be regained by eliminating ap and .

an original motivation for considering such formulationsbeside their potential usefulness in studies of
target-space brane congurations from a world-volume perspectivestems from the observation [16] that
relating the world-volume actions for branes which transform into each other under s-duality involves per-
forming poincare-duality transformations on the world-volume gauge elds. as a recipe for constructing
new brane actions from known ones, however, the latter approach has its limitations; the basic problem
is that in order to express an action s[f ] in terms of the poincare-dual eld strength f  s[f ]
f , one has
to solve an algebraic equation whose order increases with the world-volume dimension. in practice, this
obstacle has, e.g., prevented the construction of a -symmetric action for the type-iib ns5-brane from
the d5-brane action by means of a combined background z2 s-duality transformation and a world-volume
poincare transformation of the borninfeld eld strength f2.3 by employing a formulation where both
eld strengths appear simultaneously we are able to circumvent these problems, obtaining in the process
a continuous family of actions interpolating between poincare-dual limits.

as it turns out, this method can be systematised to the extent that it becomes an essentially algo-
rithmic procedure for constructing -symmetric world-volume actions. led by the available background
gauge potentials, one constructs a set of gauge-invariant world-volume eld strengths. except for the
tension eld strength, they all come in world-volume dual pairs and each such pair has an associated
interpolation parameter. inserting these eld strengths in an ansatz of the form (1), the requirement of
-symmetry turns out to be sucient to determine the action. before we go on to discuss more compli-
cated applications, we shall rst illustrate the method using a simple and transparent example; relevant
references are the papers [13, 14, 18, 19] where more detailed accounts can be found.

a simple example: the m2/d2-brane

we consider the well-known case of the s-dual pair of the m2- and type-iia d2-branes,4 omitting some
more technical points; for more details see ref. [14]. let us begin by recalling some relevant facts about
type-iia supergravity. among other elds, the bosonic sector of this theory contains the gauge-invariant
eld strengths r2, h3 and r4 (the subscript indicating the form degree) which satisfy the bianchi
identities

dr2 = 0 ,

dh3 = 0 ,

dr4 = h3 r2 .

(2)

the rst two relations imply that r2 = dc1 and h3 = db2, whereas the third one allows for some
freedom in dening r4; more precisely, r4 = dc3 + x b2 r2 (1x) c1 h3 = d(c3 + x c1 b2) c1 h3, the
parameter x thus arising from an ambiguity in the denition of c3 corresponding to the eld redenition
c3  c3 + x c1 b2. although changing the value of x does not change the physics, the eect on the form
of the world-volume theory can be signicant.
as mentioned above, gauge invariance is one of the guiding principles in the construction of the actions.
at the supergravity level, the background eld strengths are invariant under the gauge transformations

c1 = dl0 ,

b2 = dl1 ,

c3 = dl2  x r2 l1  (1x) h3 l0 .

(3)

each of the background gauge potentials couple minimally to a world-volume gauge eld, and the gauge
transformations (3) thus induce transformations on the world-volume.
in order for the world-volume
eld strengths to be gauge invariant, the latter have to be cancelled by transformations of the world-
volume gauge potentials, possibly after the inclusion of sub-leading composite terms. for the case under
consideration, the outcome of this analysis is the following set of world-volume eld strengths:

f1 = da0  c1 ,

f2 = da1  b2 ,

f3 = da2  c3 + x b2 f1  (1x) c1 f2 .

these eld strengths are gauge invariant and satisfy the bianchi identities

(4)

(5)

df1 = r2 ,

df2 = h3 ,

df3 = r4 + x f1 h3  (1x) f2 r2 .

3with motivation coming from t-duality considerations of type-iia kk monopoles, it has been suggested [17] that such

a poincare-duality transformation is not needed in this particular case.

4actually, we will be working exclusively in d = 10, so by the m2-brane we here mean the brane obtained by direct
dimensional reduction on s 1 of the d = 11 supermembrane. in other words, we consider the situation where the s-duality
transformation from the eleven-dimensional background theory down to ten dimensions has already been performed.

2

thus, although essentially trivial at the supergravity level, the eld redenition parameterised by x has
a signicant impact on the formulation of the world-volume theory, as can be seen by the x-dependent
expression for the tension-form eld strength f3. for x = 0, f1 decouples and the sub-leading terms
in f3 can be recognised as the negative of the wz-form in the d2-brane action, while for x = 1 the
tension eld strength is the one appropriate for the description of the dimensionally reduced m2-brane.
for intermediate values, on the other hand, f1 and f2 are present simultaneously, and consequently there
is one bosonic degree of freedom too many. proceeding next to construct an action for the general case,
we shall nd that the resolution of this problem is inherent in the formalism [13]. we use the ansatz5

s = z d3g (cid:2)1 + (f1, f2)  (f3)2(cid:3) .

(6)

the equation of motion for a2 is d[f3] = 0, whereas those for the dynamical gauge potentials a0 and
a1 read


f1

d(cid:2){

+ 2x b2 f3}(cid:3) = 0 ,

d(cid:2){

f2  2(1x) c1 f3}(cid:3) = 0 .



(7)

by using the bianchi identities for f1 and f2 together with the equation of motion d[f3] = 0, the
explicit dependence on the background elds can be eliminated from these equations with the result

d(cid:2){



f1  2x f2 f3}(cid:3) = 0 ,


f2

d(cid:2){

+ 2(1x) f1 f3}(cid:3) = 0 .

(8)

it is thus consistent with the equations of motion and the bianchi identities to impose the duality relations

 2xf3 f2 = k1 :=


f1

,

2(1x)f3 f1 = k2 :=


f2

,

(9)

where  is yet to be determined. the eect of these relations is to reduce the total number of degrees
of freedom contained in a1 and a2 by half, thus compensating for the doubling of gauge elds in the
action. since for the limiting value x = 0 (x = 1), f1 (f2) decouples, the degree-of-freedom counting
works out correctly. it is important to note that the duality relations must not be substituted into the
action; rather, they supplement the equations of motion derived from the latter.

the duality relations (9) also play a crucial role in implementing -symmetrythe other main guid-
ing principle of the procedurebecause they allow us to determine the variation of the action (6) (or,
equivalently, that of the constraint  = 1 +   (f3)2  0) under the -transformations

gij = 2 e(i

f1 = ir2 ,
f3 = ir4 + x f1 ih3  (1x) f2 ir2 ,

(10)

in spite of the fact that we do not know what  is from the outset (the background elds are now the
supereld extensions of their bosonic counterparts). to see how this works [13, 18], note that the scalar
function  is formed out of contractions between the world-volume eld strengths and the metric only,
and so a simple scaling argument shows that the variation of  can be written6

2 k2 f2 + 2

2! k (i

4 f3 f3(cid:3)  .

2 k (if j) + 1

by imposing the duality relations (9), k1 and k2 get replaced by explicit expressions in the world-volume
eld strengths. inserting the transformations (10) with the supergravity on-shell constraints imposed on
the background superelds and demanding that the irreducible components of the resulting variation
vanish, then allows us to deduce the duality relations and subsequently the action. the nal result is

s = z d3 g (cid:2)1 + x f1 f1 + (1x) f2 f2 + x (1x) f1 f1 f2 f2  (f3)2(cid:3) .

5in this note we will suppress the dilaton dependence; this dependence, which can be determined from the dilaton-scaling

of the supergravity constraints, is of importance when determining the -variation of the action.

6the part of this expression proportional to the dilaton variation was derived by temporarily instating the dilaton-

dependence of the action.

(11)

(12)

from this action one derives both the equations of motion (cf. (7)) and the supplementary duality relations
(cf. (9)). another important object determined in the process is the -symmetry projection operator

2 f3 p = f3 1l (cid:2)3  xf1 211 + (1x)f2 111(cid:3) .

(13)

let us at this point summarise the generic features of the procedure which carry over to the more
complicated cases to be discussed next: starting from a world-volume gauge-eld content motivated by
target-space considerations we have, by employing the principles of gauge invariance and supersymmetry
(at this level manifested as -symmetry), found a one-parameter family of actions for the d2-brane
interpolating between two limiting poincare-dual cases. for intermediate parameter values the number
of gauge elds in the action are doubled, the associated doubling of degrees of freedom being resolved
by supplementing the equations of motion with duality relations inherent in the formalism. and the
supplementary duality relations

the type-iib ns5-brane

on shell, the type-iib ns5-branelike its s-dual partner, the d5-branehas (1, 1) supersymmetry in
d = 6 and is described by a vector multiplet [20]. whether the -symmetric action for the ns5-brane
should contain a one-form gauge-potential (like the one for the d5-brane) or should be formulated in
terms of a dual three-form potential (as experience from other s-dual brane pairs would suggest) does
however not follow from this fact. our formulation allows us to by-pass this question by introducing both
potentials together with an associated interpolation parameter. these one- and three-form potentials,
a1 and a3, can also be motivated by the fact (see, e.g., ref. [21]) that d-strings and d3-branes can end
on the ns5-brane world-volume. since the same goes for d5-branes, we also introduce an extra ve-form
gauge potential a5, in addition to the tension potential a5.

using the additional fact that fundamental strings cannot end on the ns5-brane, we require that
the borninfeld eld strength f2 be absent from the world-volume action. this assumption xes the
parameterisation of the background eld strengths, and we are led to rr background and world-volume
eld strengths that can be succinctly summarised in the expressions r = eb dc and ebf = da  c,
respectively. the latter expression is iterative and we have dened f = f0 + f2 + f4 + f6, where
f0 = da1  c0 (da1 formally denoting a constant) is dual to f6 and needed for gauge invariance
(pecceiquinn symmetry). in the same compact notation the world-volume bianchi identities read

furthermore, the gauge-invariant eld strength of the ns-ns six-form gauge potential is chosen as

h7 = db6  (1y) c6 dc0 + y c0 dc6  (1x) c2 dc4 + x c4 dc2 ,

df = r + h3 f .

(14)

(15)

an expression which preserves the bianchi identity dh7 = r7 r1r5 r3 and leads to a lengthy expression
for the tension eld strength f6 (given in ref. [19]) as well as a more compact one for its bianchi identity:
2x) h3 f2 f2 . (16)
d f6 = h7 (1y) r7 f0 + y r1 f6 (1x) r3 f4 + x r5 f2 + (1xy) h3 f0 f4 + ( 1
given the above eld content, the ansatz for the action (written in dierential-form notation) takes the
form

s = z (cid:2)1 + (f0, f2, f4, f6) + f6  f6(cid:3) ,

(17)

from which we can derive the following expressions for the duality relations compatible with the bianchi
identities (14):

2y  f6 f0 = k6 :=
2(1x) f6 f2 = k4 :=


f6

f4

,

,

2(1y) f6 f6 = k0 :=

2x f6 f4 = k2 :=

(18)

using the known on-shell constraints for type-iib supergravity, one can then proceed to determine the
action by imposing -symmetry. the calculations, as well as the general results, are rather lengthy and

4

can be found in ref. [19]. for certain values of the interpolation parameters, however, the expressions
simplify considerably. for instance, when x = 2

2  f6 p =  f6 1l  [6 k + f0 6 j + 2

3 and y = 0, f6 decouples and we have
3  f2 4 i
2 ( f2  f2)} 2 k  1
3 f4f4  1

3 f4 2 j] ,
3 f0 f4  f2  f2 + 1

+ 2

9 ( f2  f4)( f2  f4) + 1

6 (f4 f4) f2  f2 + 1

12 ( f2  f2) f2  f2 .

from the latter expression the equations of motion and the duality relations may readily be derived.
since the action is -symmetric and couples correctly to the ns-ns six-form potential we can conclude
that it describes the type-iib ns5-brane.

manifestly sl(2)-covariant actions

as mentioned in the introduction, world-volume actions of the kind discussed above that are manifestly
covariant under the sl(2,z) s-duality group can be constructed for the type-iib branes [1214]. these
constructions rely on the superspace formulation of type-iib supergravity [22] where the u(1) r-symmetry
has been gauged, allowing the scalars of the theory to transform linearly under sl(2,r). more specically,
the scalars form a 22 matrix

(cid:18) u 1 u 1
u 2 u 2 (cid:19)

on which sl(2,r) acts from the left and u(1) locally from the right, both group actions preserving
2 rsu r u s = 1 (here 12 = 1). the two physical scalars of the theorythe dilaton 
the constraint i
and the axion c0are encoded in (21) as u 1(u 2)1 = c0 + i e. the sl(2) doublet u r links elds
transforming in the fundamental representation of sl(2) and sl(2)-invariant elds charged under the
gauged u(1) r-symmetry, as the world-volume eld strengths for the (p, q) ve-branes illustrate [13, 14]:

2 im(c2 f2) ,
f4 = da3  c4 + 1
f2 = u rda1;r  c2 ,
3x) im(c2 f2)f2 + 1
2 ( 2
f6 = u rda5;r  c6 + xc2 f4  (1x) c4 f2 + 1

3x) im(c2 f2)c2 . (22)
these elds are all both gauge and sl(2) invariant. whereas the four-form eld strength f4 is also u(1)
neutral, the complex two- and six-form eld strengths have u(1) charge +1, a fact which we indicate by
the use of calligraphic letters (complex conjugation, indicated with a bar, reverses the sign of the u(1)
charge). analogously, c2, c4 and c6 are sl(2)-invariant versions of the supergravity gauge potentials,
and h3, h5 and h7 in eq. (23) below the corresponding eld strengths (of which h7 depends on the
interpolation parameter x). the precise expressions for the world-volume eld strengths were determined
in the usual fashion by gauge invariance. they satisfy the bianchi identities (d is the u(1)-covariant
derivative and p is a covariantly constant one-form of u(1) charge +2 [22])

2 ( 1

df2 + i f2 p + h3 = 0 ,
df4 + h5 + 1

2 im( f2 h3) = 0 ,
2 ( 2

3x)f2 im(f2 h3) = 0 .

the ansatz for the action reads

s = z (cid:2)1 + (f2, f2, f4) + f6  f6(cid:3) ,

(23)

(24)

where  is a lagrange multiplier for the constraint  = 1+(f2, f2, f4)f6  f6  0, and  is required
to have u(1) charge zero but is otherwise unconstrained. compatibility between the equations of motion
encoded in (24) and the bianchi identities (23) require the duality relations to take the form [13]

 2x re(f6  f2) = k4 :=


f4

(1x)f6 f4 + i

6 [re(f6 f2)f2] = k2 :=

.

(25)

the complicated structure of these relations, which can be traced back to the fact that the tension eld
strength is complex, makes the -symmetry analysis dicult and necessitates a perturbative approach.

5

for an outline of this analysis and a more extensive discussion, we refer the reader to ref. [14], quoting
here only the nal results for the projection operator and the action valid up to fourth order in the
world-volume eld strengths ( is a free parameter in calculations up to this order):

2 6 p  = 6  (cid:2) 2i

(26)

(27)

a somewhat peculiar feature worth noting, is that the interpolation parameter x gets xed (to the value 2
3 )
in the process.

discussion

to summarise, we have found that using a formulation which involves auxiliary duality relations has some
advantages when constructing world-volume actions for super-p-branes. one point worth mentioning in
this context, is that this formulation allows for symmetries to be handled in a natural way, an important
example being actions with manifest sl(2) covariance in the type-iib theory. another important aspect
is the constructive nature of the approach: even in the cases where the form of the bosonic action is not
known, one can determine the full action in an essentially algorithmic fashion using gauge invariance and
-symmetry. the essential steps of the method are:

 construct gauge-invariant world-volume eld strengths and derive their bianchi identities.
 using the general ansatz for the action, derive the associated duality relations compatible with the

world-volume bianchi identities.

 derive the -variation of the action (or equivalently of the constraint ), eliminating all direct

dependence of the unknown function  in the action ansatz by means of the duality relations.

 make an ansatz for the -symmetry projection operator. (this is the only step which involves
some guesswork; we would like to stress though that in all known cases the projection operator has
a very natural form.)

 insert the background supergravity constraints and expand the variation in its irreducible compo-
nents. this leads to a set of constraints which can be used to deduce the duality relations and
hence also the action. (one can also, at least in principle, use the requirement of -invariance to
learn about the background supergravity constraints.)

moreover, we would like to stress that in our approach all gauge symmetries are made manifest; other
approaches lead to actions which do not have this property. such examples are the dual d3- and d4-brane
actions in ref. [23] as well as the type-iib ns5-brane action in ref. [17] (whereas for the former two cases
one can show that there is agreement with our approach at the level of the equations of motion, this has
not been shown for the case of the ns5-brane).

for higher-dimensional cases the actions in their most general form tend to become complicated. for
the d-branes it is always possible to choose the parameters so that all world-volume elds except f2
decouple. in this limit the auxiliary duality relations become redundant and can be dropped, and the
action becomes the standard one; here our construction is thus a natural generalisation of earlier work.
for other cases (such as the ns5-brane) there is no choice of the parameters for which the auxiliary duality
relations become superuous. this fact seems to reect an inherent obstruction to the construction of
conventional actions with all gauge symmetries manifested (cf. the m5-brane, where no action with a
chiral three-form exists [9], but where, when supplemented with its anti-chiral part (doubled) and an
auxiliary duality relation, a generalised action of the form discussed above can be constructed [18]). thus,
the price one has to pay for having manifest symmetries is the introduction of auxiliary duality relations.
as far as further applications of the method are concerned, one could proceed in various directions.
for instance, it has been argued that there should exist certain exotic extended 1/2-bps objects which

6

do not show up in hulls brane scan [10] (for some recent results and discussion, see ref. [24]). such
objectswhose masses scale with the string coupling in a non-standard fashion as gk
s with k > 2are
required to ll up u-duality multiplets for torus compactications of m theory in the matrix-theory
formulation [11, 25, 26].
in particular, u-duality considerations seem to indicate the existence of an
m8-brane in d = 11, which would give rise to exotic seven- and eight-branes in the d = 10 type-iia
theory [25]. in the type-iib theory, the existence of an ns7-brane whose mass goes as g3
is generally
accepted, and one may ask whether a similar object might exist on the type-iia side. however, it is
readily seen that a -symmetry projection operator (and hence a 1/2-bps brane) can not be constructed
in the standard manner for this case. assuming, nevertheless, that this problem could somehow be
circumvented, a possible candidate for a type-iia seven-brane is suggested by the existence in the doubled
formulation of type-iia supergravity of a eld strength h9 = db8 + , where the potential b8 is dual to
the dilaton. indeed, one can construct a gauge-invariant world-volume eld strength that couples to b8.
although it appears dicult to -symmetrise this construction (if at all possible), let us end by noting
that for every other background supergravity potential it has been possible to construct an associated
gauge-invariant wz term and subsequently a -symmetric world-volume action describing a brane which
couples to the potential.
