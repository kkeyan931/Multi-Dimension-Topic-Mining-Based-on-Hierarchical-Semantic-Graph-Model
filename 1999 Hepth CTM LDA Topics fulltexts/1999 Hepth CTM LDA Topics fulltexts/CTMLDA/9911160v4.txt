abstract

we study su (n )  s(u (n/2)  u (n/2)) symmetry breaking in n = 4
sy m via ads/cft correspondence. two stacks of n
2 parallel d3 branes
are separated by a distance 2d in the transverse directions. this leads to
an interaction between dierent l-wave dilatonic kk modes when expanded
in s5 harmonics. we calculate certain two point correlation functions of the
dual gauge theory in the decoupling limit d
  1 . due to mode mixing,
the diagonal correlation functions have 1
n conformal-like correction as well
as deformation terms. the o-diagonal correlators are also nonvanishing and
their leading order is 1
n . we discuss briey the spectrum of the glueball
exitations.

1 introduction

a recent development in the understanding of the string theory was a conjecture by
maldacena [1] according to which, in some appropriate low energy limit, there is a
duality between n = 4 supersymmetric su(n) gauge theory and type ii strings on
adsd+1m background. this is nothing but a manifestation of the old ideas [6],[7]
involving the deep connection between gauge theories and strings. therefore, from
this point of view it is clear that many problems in large n gauge theories can be
studied via supergravity in ads spaces3. the precise meaning and the explicit rules

for relating ads supergravity and the type iib string theory were given in [2] and [3].
namely, the explicit form of the correspondence between the correlation functions
of the operators in conformal eld theory (cft) living on the asymptotic conformal
boundary of the d + 1 dimensional anti-de sitter space and type ii supergravity
action evaluated on the classical solutions i was proposed to be:

hexpzs d

i

0oiicf t = exp(cid:0)s[i](cid:1)

0 = i

where ois are conformal operators in cft and i
|ads is the boundary value
of the classical solutions which serve as a source for the primary operators in cft.
the proposed correspondence has been examined in a number of calculations of the
correlation functions of operators in cft using the classical solutions of various
elds from the spectrum of ads supergravity. these, even incomplete proofs of the
validity of the holographic principle, supply us with a powerful tool for studying
strongly coupled gauge theories. most of the intensive investigations of ads/cft
correspondence however are for the case of supergravity in pure ads background,
i.e. at the origin of the moduli space where there is an enhanced superconformal
symmetry and many problems can be managed exactly even at strong coupling.

departure from the origin of the moduli space means allowing scalar elds to have
non-zero expectation values and therefore to move to the coulomb branch of the
theory. the vacua in the coulomb branch are maximally supersymmetric but some
of the gauge symmetry is broken by the expectation value of scalar elds. these cases
correspond to certain solutions of the supergravity eld equations in which the bulk
space geometry approaches ads near the boundary, but diers from it in the interior.
from holographic correspondence point of view such geometries are related either to
a relevant deformation of the conformal eld theories, or to existence of states of the
cft with vacuum expectation value which sets the energy scale. in a recent paper
by klebanov and witten [4] a more general investigation of the symmetry breaking
is given and applied to several examples. there are recent papers studying the
coulomb branch of the gauge theories in four dimensions [14, 10, 11, 8, 9, 16] which
are based on continuous spherically symmetric distributions of large number of d3
branes. they, in fact, extend the results of [12, 13] by investigating dierent probes
in the bulk of the ads space and their holographic images on the boundary. since
the eective background is asymptotically ads5  s5 one can expand the elds in
spherical harmonics and solve the supergravity equations of motion for the kaluza-
klein (kk) modes. in this case, due to spherical symmetry of the distribution of
the d3 branes the dierent kk modes decouple, thus enabling one to nd exact

2

solutions of the eld equations using ads/cft correspondence to obtain the two
point correlation functions.

in the present paper we will consider the simplest example of two stacks of equal
number coincident d3 branes separated by a distance 2~d, which corresponds to a
vacuum state of the gauge theory where the gauge su(n) symmetry is broken down
to s(u(n/2)  u(n/2)) by the expectation value of scalar elds.
in section 2 we consider the supergravity solutions in the presence of two center
d3 brane geometry and the reduction of the 10 dimensional dilaton action to ve
dimensional one by integrating over s5. it turns out that the equations of motion
for the dilatonic kk modes are coupled. this coupling modies the two-point
correlation functions, as discussed, in section 3. the diagonal correlation functions
of the operators on in the gauge theory are modied by a 1/n correction term to the
conformal-like part as a consequence of the coupling between the dierent modes.
in contrast to the conformal case and the case of uniformly distributed d3-branes,
the correlation functions hon(~x)on+2(~y)i are nonvanishing and are of order 1/n
in our approximation. in addition, all correlators have a deformation term which,
after a wick rotation, exhibits a pole structure. we interpret the appearance of
double poles as a degenerate spectrum of glueballs. all these questions are subject
of consideration in section 4. we summarize, interpret and comment on our results
in the concluding section.

2 two stacks of d3 branes: equations and solu-

tions

let us consider the case of two center d3 branes .
in this case, a large number
n of d3 branes are separated into two parallel stacks of n/2 branes each. their
separation distance introduces an energy scale in the theory. the su(n) gauge
symmetry is broken down to s(u(n/2)  u(n/2)). from the gauge theory side
this corresponds to higgsing of the gauge theory by scalar elds:

~x = ~d1.i

0

0

~d2.i!

(1)

where i is the (n/2) (n/2) identity matrix and ~di is the position of the i-th stack
in the transverse direction. let us parametrize the moduli space in terms of gauge
invariant elds as in [15, 3]:

oi = c i

i1...ik t r(cid:0)x i1 . . . x ik(cid:1)

3

(2)

i1...ik is a totally symmetric traceless rank k, so(6) tensor and x is are as
where c i
in (1). the higgsing gives expectation values for the chiral operators oi 4 which
can be expressed in terms of order parameters di [4, 15]:

to describe correlation functions on the coulomb branch let us start with the

ten dimensional type ii supergravity in the two-centered d3 brane background:

ds2 = h  1

|~y  ~d2|4!

(3)

(4)

in (4), ~y are the coordinates normal to the branes 5.

let us discuss briey the geometry of this conguration and the decoupling limit.
each of the two stacks develops a throat (geometry of which is ads) but they are
located at dierent points of s5, separated by a distance 2 ~d.
in each throat the
dilaton eld can be expanded in s5 scalar spherical harmonics which will have non
vanishing overlap with the corresponding expansion around the other throat. for
small d (compared to the radius of ads) and large r the two throats meet and in the
limit r   share a at four dimensional boundary. in this case it is natural to make
an appropriate shift in the, ~y-direction, choosing the origin so that ~d1 = ~d2 = ~d
and therefore:

h =

l4

2   1
|~y + ~d|4

+

1

|~y  ~d|4!

(5)

which allows us to consider the problem as eectively single centered. due to inter-
action between the dierent kk modes in the bulk, it is expected that their images
on the boundary result in a mixing between the correlation functions of operators

4we call these operators chiral in the sense of [15]
5it is clear that at large r the space is asymptotically ads5  s 5. since we consider the large

n case we have neglected the one in h. l4 = 4gs 2n .

of dierent conformal dimensions. we would like to point out that starting from
type iib string theory and taking the decoupling limit   0 while keeping d/
xed, we obtain an n = 4, 4-dimensional sy m theory with gauge group su(n)
spontaneously broken down to s(u(n/2)  u(n/2)) by higgs scalar expectation
value in the adjoint representation of su(n). the higgs scalars parametrize the
positions of the stacks. we use the supergravity approximation which is valid for
d << l2.
in general one must distinguish between three dierent regions: the
rst one is near the location of the branes. here the throats are well separated.
the second is where the throats come together, but this region is still far from the
boundary. the last region is near the boundary where the two throats eectively
coincide. since our coordinate system is symmetric with respect to the positions
of the stacks, the expansion over spherical harmonics qualitatively changes on the
boundary r = | ~d|. there we will apply the matching condition technique in order to
ensure well dened smooth solutions in the bulk. therefore, using this choice of the
origin of the coordinate system one can expand the harmonic function h in taylor
series in the form:

h =(cid:18) l

let us now consider the kinetic part of the 10d dilaton action:

where r = |~y|, and to obtain the ve dimensional action in the background metric (3)

we have an innite tower of kk modes i and there are no fundamental physical

we will see that the last term in (12) produces only local terms on the boundary
and therefore is irrelevant for our considerations.

6we will use the notations and normalization of the spherical harmonics as in [15].

where r = (1/r5)r(r5r).
since the metric has dierent forms in the regions of r < d and r > d we will have
two systems of equations - one for each region. taking into account the expression
for h (6) and the orthogonality of the spherical harmonics (with normalization as
in [15]) the equations of motion are given by:

in the above expressions we used the following notation:

a2l,n,mm(r, ~k)

2l,n(r, ~k)

(23)

al,i,j = a(l, i, j)hc lc ic ji

(24)

and a(l, i, j) and < c lc ic j > are as in eq.(16). we see that the equation for the
dierent kk modes of the dilaton eld n are coupled. in general, according to the
ads/cft correspondence, the operators oi are mapped to conformal uctuations in
the metrics of ads5 and s5. in our case this implies that the dilaton action projected
on the boundary will produce correlation functions of the operators oi  tr (f 2x i).
in contrast to the uniformly distributed d3 branes case, there is coupling between
the dierent kk modes, which signals a nontrivial contribution to the corresponding
correlations functions. the mixing between the kk modes means that, due to the
fact that we have a broken conformal symmetry, the sources coming from gravity
solutions will produce in general mixed correlation functions. we will see how it
happens in the next section.

the eld equations in the two regions can be transformed into bessel equations

by the following substitutions:

where primes on f denote dierentiation with respect to its argument. the terms on
the right hand side of the equations above involve coupling to kk modes. for small d
and large n, we can solve these equations perturbatively. one can see that the right

which in the decoupling limit is small. here, mw = d
is the w boson mass,

generated by symmetry breaking. this is precisely the region of validity of our
approximation, i.e.
for energies below the w -boson mass. in the zeroth order we
ignore the coupling of the modes and these solutions are used as inhomogeneous
terms in obtaining the rst order solution.

let us consider the zeroth order approximation. the solutions of the homoge-

neous system for r > d are:

fn( , ~k) =( in+2( )

kn+2( )

n = 0, 1, . . .

(29a)

and therefore the general solution for the dilatonic modes is:

n() = 2hkn+2()(0)

n (~k) + in+2()(0)

n (~k)i

(30)

where (0)

n (~k) and (0)

n (~k) are yet to be determined coecients.

the solutions in r < d region are:

fn(, ~k) =( in+2()

n (~k) + in+2(

n (~k)(cid:21)

(32)

in general, our solution must be regular in the interior of ads space so that the
solutions for r > d must be extended in r < d region to a regular solution. the only
regular solution in this region is:

n(

n (~k)

(33)

in addition, the two solutions (30) and (33) must be matched on the boundary of
the two regions ( = 1):

where qb(~k) is the boundary value of q and  is the spectral parameter in the
equations of motion. applying the above formula to the n-th dilatonic kk mode
and using the behaviour of the bessel functions of small argument, one can see that
the only contribution to the above behaviour comes from kn+2 and therefore:

as for the zeroth order solutions, the coecients (1)
n () are determined by the
boundary data. there is, however, an important dierence - these coecients are
(~k). the solutions for n-th
determined by a linear combination of n
dilatonic kk mode contain two as yet undetermined coecients, but they can be
determined by the matching conditions on the boundary of the two regions. we
will see later that these coecients will play an important role in interpreting the
correlation functions and therefore on the physics of the coulomb branch.

to conclude this section let us summarize the results we have found.
starting from 10d dilaton action in 2 stacks d3 brane background we derived
the coupled equations of motion for the kk harmonics. we have obtained explicit
solutions to rst order in 1
2 . the arbitrary coecients in the solutions were deter-
mined by applying the boundary conditions at r = d as well as from the appropriate
asymptotic properties. the most interesting results are contained in eqns(47) and
(48) which reect the coupling of the n and n + 2, kk modes. this leads to non
conformal correction terms to the correlation functions.

3 correlation functions

as mentioned in the introduction two stacks of parallel, separated d3 branes pre-
serve supersymmetry, since the poincare supersymmetries of the gauge theory are
maintained but superconformal invariance is broken by the higgsing. in the case
under consideration, the su(n) symmetry is broken down to s(u(n/2) u(n/2)).
this will modify the correlation functions which we study in this section.
from the gauge theory side, according to ads/cft correspondence, evaluation
of the action on the classical solutions will produce the correlation functions of the
i1...ikx i1 . . . x ik). as
shown in the introduction, the nontrivial contributions will come from the terms of

operators tr(cid:0)f 2x i(cid:1) (we use the notations of [15]: x i = c i

having completely determined these coecients, we simply have to subsitute the
explicit form of our rst order solutions in the boundary term action and take the
limit   0. to see which terms survive this limit, we must use the expansion of
the bessel functions for small argument. after some lengthy but straightforward
calculations we nd the following expression for the diagonal correlation functions
in momentum space ( we have omitted terms of even integer powers of k since they
produce in the position space -function and its derivatives):

in addition to the conformal-like parts (integer powers of  times ln k) the correlation
functions contain deformations coming from the coecient functions (1)
entering
the solutions. substituting the expressions for (1)
into the boundary action and
keeping the terms that survive   0 limit one can obtain the deformation functions
dn,m. to simplify the nal expressions we introduce the following notations:

in above, we have used l4 = 4gs2n, and the deformation of the conformal
part dn,m( d
it is well known that
on  tr(f 2x n).
in contrast to the case of spherically symmetric, continuously
distributed d3-branes, the mixed correlators are nonvanishing. keeping the rst
order terms in the solutions we have found that the correlation functions contain
1
n corrections. the leading term in the mixed correlators, which comes from the
rst order solutions, is proportional to 1/n. one can see directly from the explicit
form of the correlation functions that in the conformal limit d  0 (or equivalently
< x > 0) the 1
n correction term vanishes (the deformations dn,m also vanish). in
that limit the mixed correlation functions also vanish and the conformal symmetry
will be restored.

let us recapitulate the results found in this section. the physical picture that
emerges in our study of separated two stack d3 brane background is qualitatively
dierent from the case of continuously distributed d3 branes. as expected, due
to the broken conformal symmetry, the correlation functions of the boundary sym
theory in its coulomb phase have terms which vanish only in the conformal limit.
there is a deformation term much like in the case of spherical d3 brane shell and
conformal like correction which is of order 1
n . this correction does not appear
in the case of uniformly distributed d3 branes. futhermore, due to interaction
between kk modes, o diagonal correlators are nonvanishing and are of order 1
n .
all correction terms vanish in the conformal limit.the term proportional to 1
n is
not a string loop correction as we have used the classical supergravity limit.

4 deformation terms and the spectrum

in the previous section it was shown that the correlation functions on coulomb
branch have deformation terms. schematically, they have the following form:

dn,n()  (c1)n,n() + (c2)n()n2,n() + (c3)n()

dn,n+2()  (c4)n,n+2() + (c5)n,n() + (c6)n+2n,n()

where the coecients ci can be read o from the explicit form of dn,m and as before:

n,m() = (1)

n,m() + (2)

n,m()

in the above formulae we have separated n,m into (1)
n,m, the part has in the denom-
inator a product of a bessel function and it derivative, and (2)
n,m which contains in
the denominator the square of a bessel function times its derivative. we note also
that n contains in the denominator in+2i 

n+2.

in order to analyze the structure of dn,m we perform a wick rotation ~k  i~k.

one can use the transformation properties of the modied bessel functions:

i(ik) = ei 

2 j(k)

k(ik) =

i
2

ei 

2 [j(k) + in(k)]

to obtain the relevant expression for the case of minkowski space time. since the
expressions are rather complicated we will analyze only the denominators. from the
above formulae, one can see that there are two kinds of poles. simple poles come
from the zeroes of:

jn+2()j 

n+2() = 0;

or jn+2()j 

n+2jn()j 

n() = 0

(66)

and poles of order two are determined by

[jn+2()j 

n+2()]2 = 0.

we interpret these as describing the spectrum of glueballs with double degener-
acy. it is reasonable to expect that the two stacks might introduce some degeneracy
in the spectrum since they contribute identically to the boundary. the spacing
between the dierent resonant frequences is given in units of l2
d . it is interesting

18

to note that we obtain the same resonant frequencies as in the case of d3 brane
shell. however the resonances are sharp. one possible way to resolve this puzzle,
as proposed in [9] is to consider eect of absorption by the branes which introduces
nite width to these resonances. it would be very interesting to study the stability
of these resonances and their eventual decay into gauge bosons.

we show below that the deformation terms contain logarithmic corrections to the
two point correlators due to the breaking of conformal symmetry. we will consider
only the diagonal term in (64) (because it is leading order in d

l2 ) then we nd,

d0,0()  (

to compare our results with known results we will restrict to energies below the mass
of the w -boson. in this case the integral over k is nite and the logarithmic correc-
tion to the two point correlation function is reproduced. analogous considerations
hold in the case of n 
2. we note one can repeat these steps for the non-diagonal
part of d0,0 which will produce a logarithmic correction to the mixed term. in the
above range of energies, from the gauge theory side, the physics is as follows [18],[18].
since the conformal symmetry is broken by higgs scalar eld, we will have a renor-
malization group ow from the conformal point of su(n) to ir xed point with
su(n/2). if we consider the case of a d3 brane probe, the corresponding picture
on the gravity side is as a string stretched between the d3 brane and the horizon of
ads and can be described by the born-infeld action which is a yang-mills theory
plus higher derivative terms. then d/ will correspond to the mass of a w -boson
and the symmetry will be broken from su(n) to s(u(n 1)u(1)). now, one can
proceed by adding more and more d3 branes to the single one until the resulting
theory becomes s(u(n/2)u(n/2)). all of this have correct gravity approximation
when gsn >> 1, i.e. large n. in the large n limit only planar diagrams contribute.
the logarithmic correction then has an interpretation as due to processes where a
pair of virtual gauge particles is produced. the ultraviolet cut o is related to the
gravity mass gap and in the strong coupling limit it leads to a condensate of gauge
particles. it is shown in the above that our deformation term has poles in the wick
rotated k plane that correspond to bound states of glueballs.

the main feature in our calculation is contained in the second term in (64) as well
as in the non-vanishing values for the mixed correlators, i.e. correlators of conformal
operators of dierent conformal weight. note that these terms are proportional to
if we integrate out all the massive particles in the gauge theory,
we will obtain just the logarithmic correction found in [18] and reproduced in the
above. if, however, we integrate out all the massive states above some characteristic
mass scale (mcharact << d
l2 ), one can expect to have non-zero correlation functions
between conformal operators of dierent conformal weight. this is also the structure
of our mixed terms. moreover, string loop corrections coming from the born-infeld
action will be proportional to the above characteristic mass and will be negligible
compared to the 1

n correction term for the correlators.

5 conclusions

in the present paper, we have studied the coulomb branch of sym theory using
ads/cft correspondence. our considerations are based on the simplest example of

20

two stacks of n/2 parallel d3 branes separated by a distance 2d which break su(n)
symmetry to s(u(n/2)  u(n/2)). inspite of its apparent simplicity, the problem
has turned out to be complicated but interesting. this complication mainly comes
from the coupling between dierent n-wave dilatonic kk modes in the equations of
motion. these equations are solved in the leading (1/n) order. we have shown that
the coupling between kk dilatonic modes causes the appearance of mixed correlation
functions which are of order 1/n. according to ads/cft correspondence principle,
the operators on correspond to tr(f 2x n). it is obvous from the explicit form of
the correlation functions that in the conformal limit (d  0, or higgss vev tends to
zero) the 1
n correction term in the diagonal correlators and the mixed correlation
functions vanish.

all the correlation functions have also deformation terms. the analysis in the
phase space, after a wick rotation, shows that these functions have a resonant
structure - double poles at appropriate resonant frequencies. we interpret these
double poles as the degenerate spectrum of glueballs.

it will be interesting to study the correlation functions beyond this level of ap-
proximation. we expect more conformal-like terms to appear in the correlations
functions. we also have also to learn more about the spectrum of the glueballs and
to look for a mechanism of deriving more realistic masses.

since the right hand side of eq. (67) contain bessel functions times powers of  it is
instructive to consider the function h of the form:

after simple transformations and using the bessel equation for im we nd:

h = aim( )

dnh = a2h2ai 

m +(cid:0)a2 + m2  (n + 2)2(cid:1) imi

if we substitute for i 

m in the above equation:

i 

m = im+1 + mim

we nd:

dnh = a2h2aim+1 +(cid:0)(a + m)2  (n + 2)2(cid:1) imi

let us choose the parameters a and m in the following way:

therefore:

a + m = n + 2

dnh = nm+12(n  m + 2)im+1( )

and therefore:

using the above we have the solution for the second case.

2in+2( ) = 2in( )  2(n + 2)in+1( )

to obtain the solution for the third case instead of eq. (70) one can use the

following property of bessel functions:

then we will have:

dnh = a2h2aim1 +(cid:0)(a  m)2  (n + 2)2(cid:1) imi
