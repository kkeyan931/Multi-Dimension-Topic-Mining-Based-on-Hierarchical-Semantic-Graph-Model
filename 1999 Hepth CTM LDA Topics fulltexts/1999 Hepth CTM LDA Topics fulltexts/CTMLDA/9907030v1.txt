abstract

the conguration of typical highly excited (m  ms  ()1/2) string
states is considered as the string coupling g is adiabatically increased. the size
distribution of very massive single string states is studied and the mass shift,
due to long-range gravitational, dilatonic and axionic attraction, is estimated.
by combining the two eects, in any number of spatial dimensions d, the most

probable size of a string state becomes of order s = 2  when g2m/ms  1.
depending on the dimension d, the transition between a random-walk-size
string state (for low g) and a compact ( s) string state (when g2m/ms  1)
can be very gradual (d = 3), fast but continuous (d = 4), or discontinuous
(d  5). those compact string states look like nuggets of an ultradense state
of string matter, with energy density   g2m d+1
. our results extend and
clarify previous work by susskind, and by horowitz and polchinski, on the
correspondence between self-gravitating string states and black holes.

i. introduction

almost exactly thirty years ago the study of the spectrum of string theory (known at the
time as the dual resonance model) revealed [1] a huge degeneracy of states growing as an
exponential of the mass. this led to the concept of a limiting (hagedorn) temperature thag
in string theory. only slightly more recently bekenstein [2] proposed that the entropy of a
black hole should be proportional to the area of its horizon in planck units, and hawking
[3] xed the constant of proportionality after discovering that black holes, after all, do emit
thermal radiation at a temperature thaw  r1
bh.
when string and black hole entropies are compared one immediately notices a striking
dierence: string entropy1 is proportional to the rst power of mass in any number of spatial
dimensions d, while black hole entropy is proportional to a d-dependent power of the mass,
always larger than 1. in formulae:

given their dierent mass dependence, it is obvious that, for a given set of the funda-
mental constants gn , , g2, ss > sbh at suciently small m, while the opposite is true
at suciently large m. obviously, there has to be a critical value of m, mc, at which
ss = sbh. this observation led bowick et al. [4] to conjecture that large black holes end up
their hawking-evaporation process when m = mc, and then transform into a higher-entropy
string state without ever reaching the singular zero-mass limit. this reasoning is conrmed
[5] by the observation that, in string theory, the fundamental string length s should set
a minimal value for the schwarzschild radius of any black hole (and thus a maximal value
for its hawking temperature). it was also noticed [4], [6], [7] that, precisely at m = mc,
rbh = s and the hawking temperature equals the hagedorn temperature of string theory.
for any d, the value of mc is given by:

order unity.

susskind and collaborators [6], [8] went a step further and proposed that the spectrum of
black holes and the spectrum of single string states be identical, in the sense that there be
a one to one correspondence between (uncharged) fundamental string states and (uncharged)
black hole states. such a correspondence principle has been generalized by horowitz and
polchinski [9] to a wide range of charged black hole states (in any dimension). instead of
keeping xed the fundamental constants and letting m evolve by evaporation, as considered
above, one can (equivalently) describe the physics of this conjectured correspondence by
following a narrow band of states, on both sides of and through, the string  black hole
transition, by keeping xed the entropy3 s = ss = sbh, while adiabatically4 varying the
string coupling g, i.e. the ratio between p and s. the correspondence principle then means
that if one increases g each (quantum) string state should turn into a (quantum) black hole
state at suciently strong coupling, while, conversely, if g is decreased, each black hole state
should decollapse and transform into a string state at suciently weak coupling. for all
the reasons mentioned above, it is very natural to expect that, when starting from a black
hole state, the critical value of g at which a black hole should turn into a string is given, in
clear relation to (1.3), by

and is related to the common value of string and black-hole entropy via

in the case of extremal bps, and nearly extremal, black holes the conjectured correspon-
dence was dramatically conrmed through the work of strominger and vafa [10] and others
[11] leading to a statistical mechanics interpretation of black-hole entropy in terms of the
number of microscopic states sharing the same macroscopic quantum numbers. however,
little is known about whether and how the correspondence works for non-extremal, non bps
black holes, such as the simplest schwarzschild black hole5. by contrast to bps states whose
mass is protected by supersymmetry, we shall consider here the eect of varying g on the
mass and size of non-bps string states.

3one uses here the fact that, during an adiabatic variation of g, the entropy of the black hole sbh 
(area)/gn  rd1
bh /gn stays constant. this result (known to hold in the einstein conformal
frame) applies also in string units because sbh is dimensionless.

4the variation of g can be seen, depending on ones taste, either as a real, adiabatic change of g
due to a varying dilaton background, or as a mathematical way of following energy states.

5for simplicity, we shall consider in this work only schwarzschild black holes, in any number
d  d  1 of non-compact spatial dimensions.

although it is remarkable that black-hole and string entropy coincide when rbh = s,
this is still not quite sucient to claim that, when starting from a string state, a string
becomes a black hole at g = gc. in fact, the process in which one starts from a string state
in at space and increases g poses a serious puzzle [6]. indeed, the radius of a typical excited
string state of mass m is generally thought of being of order

rrw
s  s(m/ms)1/2 ,

(1.6)

as if a highly excited string state were a random walk made of m/ms = m/s segments of
length s [12]. [the number of steps in this random walk is, as is natural, the string entropy
(1.1).] the random walk radius (1.6) is much larger than the schwarzschild radius for all
couplings g  gc, or, equivalently, the ratio of self-gravitational binding energy to mass (in
d spatial dimensions)

(1.7)

remains much smaller than one (when d > 2, to which we restrict ourselves) up to the
transition point. in view of (1.7) it does not seem natural to expect that a string state will
collapse to a black hole when g reaches the value (1.4). one would expect a string state
of mass m to turn into a black hole only when its typical size is of order of rbh(m) (which
is of order s at the expected transition point (1.4)). according to eq. (1.7), this seems to
happen for a value of g much larger than gc.

horowitz and polchinski [13] have addressed this puzzle by means of a thermal scalar
formalism [14]. their results suggest a resolution of the puzzle when d = 3 (four-dimensional
spacetime), but lead to a rather complicated behaviour when d  4. more specically, they
consider the eective eld theory of a complex scalar eld  in d (spacetime) dimensions
(with period  in euclidean time  ), with mass squared m2() = (42 2)1 [g  2  2
h],
where g is the string metric and 1
h the hagedorn temperature. they took into account
the eect of gravitational (and dilatonic) self-interactions in a mean eld approximation.
this leads to an approximate hartree-like equation for (x), which admits a stable bound
state, in some range g0 < g < gc, when d = 3. they interpret the size of the bound state
wave function (x) as the size of the string, and nd that (in d = 3) this size is of order

 

1

g2 m

.

(1.8)

they describe their result by saying that the string contracts from its initial (large)
size, when g  g0  (m/ms)3/4, down to the string scale when g  gc  (m/ms)1/2.
this interpretation of the length scale , characterizing the thermal scalar bound state, as
the size of the string is unclear to us, because of the formal nature of the auxiliary eld
 which has no direct physical meaning in minkowski spacetime. moreover, the analysis of
ref. [13] in higher dimensions is somewhat inconclusive, and suggests that a phenomenon
of hysteresis takes place (when d  5): the critical value of g corresponding to the string
 black hole transition would be g0  (m/ms)(d6)/4 > gc for the direct process (string
black hole), and gc for the reverse one. finally, they suggest that, in the reverse process,
a black hole becomes an excited string in an atypical state.

4

the aim of the present work is to clarify the string  black hole transition by a direct
study, in real spacetime, of the size and mass of a typical excited string, within the micro-
canonical ensemble of self-gravitating strings. our results lead to a rather simple picture of
the transition, in any dimension. we nd no hysteresis phenomenon in higher dimensions.
the critical value for the transition is (1.4), or (1.5) in terms of the entropy s, for both di-
rections of the string  black hole transition. in three spatial dimensions, we nd that the
size (computed in real spacetime) of a typical self-gravitating string is given by the random
walk value (1.6) when g2  g2

conrms the picture proposed by ref. [13] when d = 3, but with the bonus that eq. (1.9)
(which agrees with eq. (1.8)) refers to a radius which is estimated directly in physical space
(see below), and which is the size of a typical member of the microcanonical ensemble of
in all higher dimensions6, we nd that the size of a typical self-
self-gravitating strings.
gravitating string remains xed at the random walk value (1.6) when g  gc. however,
when g gets close to a value of order gc, the ensemble of self-gravitating strings becomes
(smoothly in d = 4, but suddenly in d  5) dominated by very compact strings of size  s
(which are then expected to collapse with a slight further increase of g because the dominant
size is only slightly larger than the schwarzschild radius at gc).

our results conrm and clarify the main idea of a correspondence between string states
and black hole states [6], [8], [9], [13], and suggest that the transition between these states
is rather smooth, with no apparent hysteresis, and with continuity in entropy, mass and
typical size.
it is, however, beyond the technical grasp of our analysis to compute any
precise number at the transition (such as the famous factor 1/4 in the bekenstein-hawking
entropy formula).

ii. size distribution of free string states

the aim of this section is to estimate the distribution function in size of the ensemble of
free string states of mass m, i.e. to count how many massive string states have a given size
r. this estimate will be done while neglecting the gravitational self-interaction. the eect
of the latter will be taken into account in a later section.

let us rst estimate the distribution in size by a rough, heuristic argument based on the
random walk model [12] of a generic excited string state. in string units (s  m 1
s  1), the
geometrical shape (in d-dimensional space) of a generic massive string state can be roughly
identied with a random walk of m steps of unit length. we can constrain this random

walk to stay of size < r by considering a diusion process, starting from a point source at

the origin, in presence of an absorbing sphere sr of radius r, centered on the origin. in the

continuous approximation, the kernel kt(x, 0) giving the conditional probability density of
ending, at time t, at position x, after having started (at time 0) at the origin, without having
ever gone farther from the origin than the distance r, satises: (i) the diusion equation
t kt =  kt, (ii) the initial condition k0(x, 0) = (x), and (iii) the absorbing boundary
condition kt = 0 on the sphere sr. the kernel kt can be decomposed in eigenmodes,

kt(x, 0) =xn

n(x) n(0) een t ,

(2.1)

where n(x) is a normalized (real) l2 basis (r dd x n(x) m(x) = nm;xn

(x  y)) satisfying

n(x) n(y) =

(2.2)

 n = en  ,

in the interior, and vanishing on sr. the total conditional probability of having stayed
dd x kt(x, 0) within the ball br : |x|  r. for
large values of t, kt is dominated by the lowest eigenvalue e0, and the conditional probability
goes like c0 ee0 t, where c0 is a numerical constant of order unity. the eigenvalue problem
(2.2) is easily solved (in any dimension d), and the s-wave ground state can be expressed in

within sr after the time t is the integralrbr
terms of a bessel function: 0(r) = n j(k0 r)/(k0 r) with  = (d  2)/2. here, k0 = e0
is given by the rst zero j of j(z) : k0 = j/r. the important information for us is that
the ground state energy e0 scales with r like e0 = c1/r2, where c1 = o(1) is a numerical
constant. this scaling is evident for the dirichlet problem(2.2), whatever be the shape of
the boundary. finally, remembering that the number of time steps is given by the mass,
t = m, we expect the looked for conditional probability, i.e. the fraction of all string states

at mass level m which are of size < r, to be asymptotically of order

f (r)  ec1 m/r2

.

(2.3)

this estimate is expected to be valid when m/r2  1, i.e. for string states which are much
smaller (in size) than a typical random walk r2
rw  m (but still larger than the string length,
r > 1). in the opposite limit, r2  m, the kernel kt(x, 0) can be approximated by the
free-space value k (0)
t (x, 0) = (4  t)d/2 exp(x2/(4t)), with t = m, so that the fraction of
string states of size > r  rrw will be of order  ec2 r2/m , with c2 = o(1).
as the result (2.3) will be central to the considerations of this paper, we shall now go
beyond the previous heuristic, random walk argument and derive the fraction of small string
states by a direct counting of quantum string states. for simplicity, we shall deal with open

bosonic strings (s  2 , 0    )

one can further specify the choice of worldsheet coordinates by imposing

where n is an arbitrary timelike or null vector (n  n  0) [15]. eq. (2.8) means that
the n-projected oscillators n

obtained by choosing a xed, null vector n. the light-cone gauge introduces a preferred
(longitudinal) direction in space, which is an inconvenience for dening the (rms) size of a
massive string state. as we shall be interested in quasi-classical, very massive string states
(n  1) it should be possible to work in the center of mass gauge, where the vector n
used in eq. (2.8) to dene the  -slices of the world-sheet is taken to be the total momentum
p of the string. this gauge is the most intrinsic way to describe a string in the classical
limit. using this intrinsic gauge, one can covariantly7 dene the proper rms size of a massive

the squared-size operator r, eq. (2.11), contains the logarithmically innite contribution
meaning (see, e.g., [16]), we note here that this contribution is state-independent. we are
interested in this work in the relative sizes of various highly excited, quasi-classical states. a
concept which should reduce to the well-dened, nite rms size of a classical nambu string
in the classical limit. we shall therefore discard this state-independent contribution, i.e.

the problem we would like to solve is to count the number of physical states, in the
fock space of the center-of-mass oscillators i
n, having some xed values of n and r (we
henceforth work only with the normal-ordered operator (2.12) without adorning it with
the : : notation). the virasoro constraints make this problem technically quite dicult.
however, we know from the exact counting of physical states (without size restriction) in
the light-cone gauge that the essential physical eect of the virasoro constraints is simply
to reduce the number of independent oscillators at any level n from d = d  1 (in the
center-of-mass gauge) to d  1 = d  2. if we (formally) consider d as a large parameter8,
this change in the number of eective free oscillators should have only a small fractional
eect on any other coarse-grained, counting problem. we shall assume that this is the case,
and solve the much simpler counting problem where the d oscillators i
n are considered as
independent9. to solve this problem we pass from a microcanonical problem (xed values

problem.

iii. mass shift of string states due to self-gravity

in this section we shall estimate the mass shift of string states (of mass m and size
r) due to the exchange of the various long-range elds which are universally coupled to

11

the string: graviton, dilaton and axion. as we are interested in very massive string states,
m  ms, in extended congurations, r  s, we expect that massless exchange dominates
the (state-dependent contribution to the) mass shift.
the evaluation, in string theory, of (one loop) mass shifts for massive states is technically
quite involved, and can only be tackled for the states which are near the leading regge
trajectory [18].
[indeed, the vertex operators creating these states are the only ones to
admit a manageable explicit oscillator representation.] as we consider states which are very
far from the leading regge trajectory, there is no hope of computing exactly (at one loop)
their mass shifts. we shall resort to a semi-classical approximation, which seems appropriate
because we consider highly excited congurations. as a starting point to derive the mass-
shift in this semi-classical approximation we shall use the classical results of ref. [19] which
derived the eective action of fundamental strings. the one-loop exchange of g,  and
b leads to the eective action

i e = i0 + i1 ,

(3.1)

where i0 is the free (nambu) string action (d2 1  d1 d1, 1 =  det ab (x (1, 1)))

i0 = tz d2 1 1 ,

(3.2)

(3.3)

(3.5)

and i1 the eect of the one-loop interaction (x 

1  x (1, 1), . . .)

i1 = 2z z d21 d22 gf (x1  x2) 1 2 ctot(x1, x2) ,

where gf is feynmans scalar propagator ( gf (x) = d(x)), and ctot(x1, x2) = j(x1)
j(x2) + jg(x1)  jg(x2) + jb(x1)  jb(x2) comes from the couplings of , g and b
to their corresponding world-sheet sources (indices suppressed; spin-structure hidden in the
dot product). the exchange term ctot takes, in null (conformal) coordinates  =   ,
the simple left-right factorized form [19]

1 2 ctot(x1, x2) = 32 gn t 2 (+ x 

1 + x2)( x

interpreted at the quantum level, the classical result (3.8) gives (modulo some ordering
problems, which are, however, fractionally negligible when considering very massive states)
the mass-shift  m 2
n of the string state |ni when replacing w (k, 1, 2), on the right-hand side
of eq. (3.8), by the quantum average hn| w (k, 1, 2)|ni. here, we shall mainly be interested
in the real part of  m 2, obtained by replacing (k2  i)1 by the principal part of (k2)1

rate of emission of massless quanta.] as l0  1 is the hamiltonian that governs the  -
evolution of an open string, the vanishing of (l0  1)|ni for any physical state ensures
that hn| w (k, 1, 2)|ni is  -translation invariant, i.e. that it depends only on the dierence
12  1  2, and not on the average   1
2 (1 + 2). this means that the double world-
sheet integration d21 d22 = d1 d1 d2 d2 = d d12 d1 d2 on the right-hand side of

eq. (3.8) contains a formally innite infra-red volume factorr d  which precisely cancels
the integralr d  on the left-hand side to leave a nite answer for  m 2.

it is also important to note the good ultraviolet behaviour of eq. (3.8). the ultraviolet
limit k   corresponds to the coincidence limit (2, 2)  (1, 1) on the world-sheet.

11for simplicity, we call graviton the exchanged particle, which is a superposition of the graviton,
the dilaton and the axion.

let us dene u  +

v  0. in this limit the vertex insertion factors ( p+)2 ( p)2 tend to zero like u2 v2,
while the greens function blows up like [( x)2](d2)/2  (uv)(d2)/2. the resulting
integral, r du dv (uv)(d6)/2, has its rst ultraviolet pole when the space-time dimension
d = d + 1 = 8. this means probably that in dimensions d  8 the exchange of massive
modes (of closed strings) becomes important. our discussion, which is limited to considering
only the exchange of massless modes, is probably justied only when d < 8.

following the (approximate) approach of section 2 we shall estimate the average mass
shift  m 2(r) for string states of size r by using the grand canonical ensemble with density

space built upon d sequences of string oscillators i
n (formal center-of-mass oscillators).
for any quantity q (built from string oscillators) we denote the grand canonical average as
hqi,  tr (q ). using the  -shift invariance mentioned above, eq. (3.8) yields

we shall estimate the grand canonical average hwi, in a semi-classical approximation
in which we neglect some of the contributions linked to the ordering of the operator w , but
take into account the quantum nature of the d ensity matrix , eq. (3.10). the discreteness
of the fock states built from the(ai
n), and the planckian nature of  will play a crucial role in
the calculation below. [by contrast, a purely classical calculation would be awkward and ill-
dened because of the problem of dening a measure on classical string congurations, and
because of the rayleigh-jeans ultraviolet catastrophe.] to compute hwi, it is convenient
to dene it as a double contraction of the coecient of  1

we shall dene our ordering of w by working with the normal ordered exponentiated op-
erator (3.12) (and picking the term linear in 1

(where, to ease the notation, we drop the extra label ) can be computed by a generalization
of blochs theorem. namely, if a denotes any operator which is linear in the oscillators i

we have the results

also,ref. [15] and the appendix 7.a of ref. [21]). for instance, to prove the second equation
(3.13) it is sucient to consider a single oscillator and to check that (denoting q = e, with

the calculation of the various contractions [ab]  h : ab :i in eqs. (3.16), (3.17) is

we can estimate the values of the right-hand sides of eqs. (3.19) and (3.21) by using
the following statistical approximation.
in the parameter range discussed in section 2

by a large interval,  n  1, around some n0  1, of values of n, so that one can, with
a good approximation, replace the discrete sum over n by a formal continuous integral

show that any oscillatory integral of the type r dn f (n) cos n  = [n1 f (n) sin n ] 
r dn n1 f (n) sin n  is, because of the factors n1, numerically much smaller than the
non-oscillatory oner dn f (n). [here  denotes some combination of 1 and 2, like 21, 22,

1  2.] alternatively, we can say that, for generic values of 1 and 2, one can treat in
eqs. (3.20) or (3.22) cos n 1 and cos n 2 as statistically independent random variables with
zero average. within such an approximation one can estimate (3.19) by replacing xn(1, 2) by
1 (because cos2 n 1 + cos2 n 2 = 1 + 1
2 (cos 2n 1 + cos 2n 2)). similarly, one can estimate
(3.21) by replacing p
n  1. the resulting estimates of (3.19) and (3.21) introduce exactly
the grand canonical averages of the quantities : r : and n:

the result (3.26) was expected in order of magnitude, but we found useful to show how
it approximately comes out of a detailed calculation of the mass shift which incorporates
both relativistic and quantum eects.
it shows clearly that perturbation theory breaks
down, even at arbitrarily small coupling, for suciently heavy and compact strings. let
us also point out that one can give a simple statistical interpretation of the calculation
(3.16) of the normal-ordered vertex operator w (k, 1, 2), with the basic contractions (3.18).
the result of the calculation would have been the same if we had simply assumed that
the oscillators ai
n were classical, complex random variables with a gaussian probability

random walk model of a generic excited string state. the fact that the random walk must be
made of m/ms independent steps is linked to the fact that the planckian distribution of mean

distribution  exp(cid:2) 1
n|2(cid:3). this equivalence underlies the success of the classical
occupation numbers, n n = (exp( n+ /n)1)1 is sharply cut o when n > 1, i.e., from
eq. (2.28), when n > m/ms. more precisely, using the same statistical approximation as
above, one nds that the slope correlator h :  ex i(, 1)  ex j(, 2) :i, decays quite fast
when |2  1| > ms/m.
finally, let us mention that, by using the same tools as above, one can compute the
imaginary part of the mass shift  m =  mreal i /2, i.e. the total decay rate  in massless
quanta. the quantity  is, in fact, easier to dene rigorously in string theory because, using
(k2  i )1 = p p (k2)1 + i (k2) in (3.8), it is given by an integral where the massless
quanta are all on-shell. when  = 0 (a consistent approximation for a result dominated
by n  1) one can use the covariant formalism with d = d + 1 oscillators to nd,after
replacing a discrete sum over n by an integral over ,

d is a numerical constant, and where n = m 2

the total power radiated by the -ensemble of strings is then simply deduced from (3.28) by
adding a factor   in the integrand:

(3.29)

12the sign  m < 0 was classically clear (even when taking into account relativistic eects),
say in d = 3, from the starting formulas (3.3), (3.4) where gsym(x) = (4)1 (x2) > 0 and
4(+ x1  + x2) ( x1   x2) = (+  x)2 (  x)2 > 0 because  x  is purely spacelike in
the center-of-mass frame. the same conclusion would hold in the light-cone gauge.

17

the results (3.28), (3.29) agree with corresponding results (for closed strings) in the
second reference [8] and in [22] (note, however, that the factor m 2 in the equation (3.2) of
[22] should be m and that the constant contains gn and powers of s). the integrals (3.28),
(3.29) are dominated by n  1, i.e.   ms. this gives for the integrated quantities:

  g2 m , p  g2 m ms .

tially, with half-evaporation time

(3.31)

let us anticipate on the next section and note that, at the transition   g2 m/ms  1
between string states and black hole states, not only the mass and the entropy are (in order
of magnitude at least) continuous, but also the various radiative quantities: total luminosity

iv. entropy of self-gravitating strings

in the present section we shall combine the main results of the previous sections,
eqs. (2.32) and (3.26), and heuristically extend them at the limit of their domain of validity.
we consider a narrow band of string states that we follow when increasing adiabatically
the string coupling g, starting from g = 013. let m0, r0 denote the bare values (i.e. for
g  0) of the mass and size of this band of states. under the adiabatic variation of g,
the mass and size, m, r, of this band of states will vary. however, the entropys(m, r)
remains constant under this adiabatic process: s(m, r) = s(m0, r0). we assume, as usual,
that the variation of g is suciently slow to be reversible, but suciently fast to be able to
neglect the decay of the states. we consider states with sizes s  r0  m0 for which the
correction factor,

c (r0)  (1  c1 r2

0 ) (1  c2 r2

0/m 2

0 ) ,

in the entropy

s(m0, r0) = c (r0) a0 m0 ,

(4.1)

(4.2)

13alternatively, we can consider the coupling as an adjustable parameter (it is so in perturbation
theory) and just follow how dierent physical quantities change as g is varied, whithout pretending
that the change takes place in physical time.

18

is near unity. [we use eq. (2.32) in the limit g  0, for which it was derived.] because of
this reduced sensitivity of c (r0) on a possible direct eect of g on r (i.e. r(g) = r0 + g r),
the main eect of self-gravity on the entropy (considered as a function of the actual values
m, r when g 6= 0) will come from replacing m0 as a function of m and r. the mass-shift
result (3.26) gives  m = m  m0 to rst order in g2. to the same accuracy14, (3.26) gives
m0 as a function of m and r:

m0  m + c3 g2 m 2

rd2 = m(cid:18)1 + c3

g2 m

rd2(cid:19) ,

(4.3)

where c3 is a positive numerical constant.

finally, combining eqs. (4.1)(4.3) (and neglecting, as just said, a small eect linked to
g r 6= 0) leads to the following relation between the entropy, the mass and the size (all
considered for self-gravitating states, with g 6= 0)

(4.4)

r2(cid:19)(cid:18)1 

r2

m 2(cid:19)(cid:18)1 +

g2 m

rd2(cid:19) .

for notational simplicity, we henceforth set to unity the coecients c1, c2 and c3. there is no
loss of generality in doing so because we can redene s, r and g to that eect, and use the
corresponding (new) string units. the main point of the present paper is to emphasize that,
for a given value of the total energy m (and for some xed value of g), the entropy s(m, r)
has a non trivial dependence on the radius r of the considered string state. eq. (4.3) exhibits
two eects varying in opposite directions: (i) self-gravity favors small values of r (because
they correspond to larger values of m0, i.e. of the bare entropy), and (ii) the constraint

of being of some xed size r disfavors both small (r  m ) and large (r  m ) values

of r. for given values of m and g, the most numerous (and therefore most probable) string
states will have a sizer(m; g) which maximizes the entropy s(m, r). said dierently, the
total degeneracy of the complete ensemble of self-gravitating string states with total energy
m (and no a priori size restriction) will be given by an integral (where  r is the rms
uctuation of r given by eq. (2.17))

d(m) z dr

 r

es(m,r)  es(m,r)

(4.5)

which will be dominated by the saddle point r which maximizes the exponent.

the value of the most probable size r is a function of m, g and the space dimension
d. to better see the dependence on d, let us rst consider the case (which we generically
assume) where the correction factors in eq. (4.4) (parentheses on the right-hand-side) are
very close to unity so that

s(m, r)  a0 m (1  v (r)) ,

(4.6)

14actually, eq. (4.3) is probably a more accurate version of the mass-shift formula because it
exhibits the real mass m (rather than the bare mass m0) as the source of self-gravity.

19

where

v (r) =

one can think of v (r) as an eective potential for r. the most probable size r must
minimize v (r). this eective potential can be thought of as the superposition of: (i) a
centrifugal barrier near r = 0 (coming from the result (2.30)), (ii) an harmonic potential
(forbidding the large values of r), and (iii) an attractive (gravitational) potential. when
g2 is small the minimum of v (r) will come from the competition between the centrifugal
barrier and the harmonic potential and will be located around the value r2
/m 2, i.e.

r  m = rrw. this random walk value will remain (modulo small corrections) a local
minimum of v (r) (i.e. a local maximum of s(m, r)) as long as g2 m/rd2

note that, when g2  g2
0, the value of v (r) at this local minimum is of order vmin 
  + 2m 1, i.e. that it corresponds to a saddle-point entropy s(m, r)  a0 m(1 
+ 2r2
vmin)  a0 m  o(1) which diers essentially negligibly from the bare entropy a0 m
( 1). to study what happens when g2 further increases let us consider separately the
various dimensions d  3. we shall see that the special value g2
0, eq. (4.8), is signicant (as
marking a pre-transition, before the transition to the black hole state) only ford = 3. for
d  4, the only special value of g2 is the critical value

around which takes place a transition toward a state more compact than the usual random
walk one.

a. d = 3

let us rst consider the (physical) case d = 3, for which g2

c  m 1.
in that case, when g2 becomes larger than g2
0, the (unique) local minimum of v (r) slowly
shifts towards values of r lower than rrw and determined by the competition between the
centrifugal barrier 1/r2 and the gravitational potentialg2 m/r.

note that as g2 increases between m 3/2 and m 1, the most probable size r(d=3)
smoothly interpolates between rrw and a value of order unity, i.e. of order the string
length. note also that vmin  g2 m/(2r)  g4 m 2/4 remains smaller than one when
g2 < m 1 so that the saddle-point entropy s(m, r)  a0 m(1  vmin) never diers much
from the bare value a0 m.
when g2, in its increase, becomes comparable to m 1, the radius becomes of order one
and it is important to take into account the (supposedly) more exact expression (4.4) (in
which the factor (1 r2) plays the crucial role of cutting o any size r  1). if we neglect,
as above, the term r2/m 2 (which is indeed even more negligible in the region r  1) but
maximize the factored expression (4.4), we nd that the most probable size r reads



1 + 1 + 3 2

(4.12)

(4.13)

when   1, the result (4.12) reproduces the simple linearized estimate (4.11). when
 > 1, eq. (4.12) says that the most probable size, when g2 increases, tends to a limiting size
(r = 3) slightly larger than the minimal one (rmin = 1) corresponding to zero entropy.
[note that even for the formal asymptotic value r = 3, the reduction in entropy due
to the factor 1  r2 is only 2/3.] on the other hand, the fractional self-gravity gn m/r
(which measures the gravitational deformation away from at space), or the corresponding
term in eq. (4.4), continues to increase with g2 as


r

=

2

1 + 1 + 3 2

.

(4.14)

the right-hand side of eq. (4.14) becomes unity for  = 5 = 2.236. the picture suggested
by these results is that the string smoothly contracts, as g increases, from its initial random
walk size down to a limiting compact state of size slightly larger than s. for some value
of  of order unity (may be between 1 and 2; indeed, even for  = 1 the size r = 2 and
the self-gravity /r = 0.5 suggest one may still trust a compact string description) the
self-gravity of this compact string state will become so strong that one expects it to collapse
to a black hole state. we recall that, as emphasized in refs.
[4], [6], [7], [8], [9], [13], when
  1, the mass of the string state matches (in order of magnitude) that of a (schwarzschild)
black hole with bekenstein-hawking entropy equal to the string entropy s.

b. d = 4

when d = 4, the argument above eq. (4.9) suggests that the random-walk size remains

the most probable size up to g2 < g2

0  m 1, i.e. up to  < 1. a more accurate approxi-

mation to the most probable size r, when  < 1, is obtained by minimizing exactly v (r),
eq. (4.7). this yields

21

r(d=4)



 m 1/2 (1  )1/4 , when  < 1 .

(4.15)

this shows that the size will decrease, but one cannot trust this estimate when   1. to
study more precisely what happens when   1 we must take into account the more exact
factorized form (4.4). let us now neglect the r2/m 2 term and consider the approximation

s(d=4)(m, r)  a0 m(cid:18)1 

1

r2(cid:19)(cid:18)1 +



r2(cid:19) .

(4.16)

the right-hand side of eq. (4.15) has a maximum only for  > 1, in which case

r(d=4)



  1(cid:19)1/2
(cid:18) 2

when  > 1 .

(4.17)

if we had taken into account the full expression (4.4) the two results (4.15), (4.17), valid
on each side of  = 1, would have blended in a result showing that around15  = 1 the
most probable size continuously interpolates between rrw and a size of order s. note that,
tends to a limiting size (r = 2)
according to eq. (4.17), as  becomes  1, r(d=4)
slightly larger than rmin = 1 (corresponding to zero entropy). when  > 1 the fractional
self-gravity of the compact string states reads




r2


=

.

(4.18)

as in the case d = 3, one expects that for some value of  strictly larger than 1, the self-
gravity of the compact string state will become so strong that it will collapse to a black
hole state. again the mass, size and entropy match (in order of magnitude) those of a black
hole when   1. the only dierence between d = 4 and d = 3 is that the transition to
the compact state, though still continuous, is sharply concentrated around  = 1 instead of
taking place over the extended range m 1/2 <  < 1.

c. d  5

when d  5, the argument around eq. (4.8) shows that the random walk size rrw 
m is a consistent local maximum of the entropy in the whole domain g2  g2
for
  g2 m  m
2 , which allows values   1. however, a second, disconnected maximum
of the entropy, as function ofr, could exist. to investigate this we consider again (4.4),
when neglecting the r2/m 2 term (because we are interested in other possible solutions with
small sizes):

0, i.e.

d4

s(m, r)
a0 m  (1  x) (1 +  x)  s(x) ,

(4.19)

15the transition takes place in the range |  1|  m 2/3 corresponding to r  m 1/3.

22

where we have dened x  r2 and   (d  2)/2. by studying analytically the maxima
and inection points of s(x), one nds that, in the present case where  = (d  2)/2 > 1,
there are two critical values 1 < 2 of the parameter   g2 m. the rst one,
,

, r1 = x1/2

corresponds to the birth (through an inection point) of a maximum and a minimum of the
function s(r). because s1 < 1 is strictly lower than the usual random walk maximum with
s(rrw)  1  2/m  1, the local maximum near r  1 of the entropy, which starts to exist
when  > 1, is, at rst, only metastable with respect to rrw. however, there is a second
critical value of , 2 > 1, dened by

2 = (cid:18) 

  1(cid:19)1

, r2 = x1/2

  1(cid:19) 1

> 1 , s2 = 1 .

(4.21)

when  > 2 the local maximum near r  1 of the entropy has s(r) > 1, i.e. it has become
the global maximum of the entropy, making the usual random walk local maximum only
metastable. therefore,when  > 2 the most probable string state is a very compact state

of size comparable to s. formally, this new global maximum exists for any  > 1 and tends,
when   , toward the limiting location r inf ty = (( + 1)/)1/2 > 1, i.e. slightly (but
nitely) above the minimum size r = 1. however, as in the cases d  4, the self-gravity
of the stable compact string state will become strong when  > 1, so that it is expected to
collapse (for some c > 2) to a black hole state. as in the cases d  4, the mass, size and
entropy of this compact string state match those of a black hole. the big dierence with the
cases d  4 is that the transition between the (stable) random walk typical conguration
and the (stable) compact one is discontinuous. our present model suggests that (when
  (d  2)/2 > 1) a highly excited single string system can exist, when  > 2, in two
dierent stable typical states: (i) a dilute state of typical size rrw  m and typical mean
density   m/rd
rw  m   1, and (ii) a condensed state of typical size r  1 and typical
mean density (using   1):   m  g2  1. we shall comment further below on the
value   g2 of the dense state of string matter.

v. discussion

technically, the main new result of the present work is the (dimension independent)
estimate16 c(r) = 1 c1/r2, with c1  (3/4) 2
s = 3/2, of the factor giving the decrease in
the entropy (2((d  1) /6)1/2 m) of a narrow band of very massive (open17) string states

16in spite of our eorts in section ii, this result remains non rigorous and open to o(1/d) fractional
corrections because of the diculty to dene a good quantum operator representing the mean radius
of a string state.

17for technical simplicity, we have restricted our attention to open bosonic strings. we could
have dealt with closed bosonic strings by doubling the oscillators, but the level matching condition,

23

m  ()1/2, when considering only string states of size r (modulo some fractionally
small grand-canonical-type uctuations). we have also justied (by dealing explicitly with
relativistic and quantum eects in a semi-classical approximation) and rened (by computing
the numerical coecient, eq. (3.27)) the naive estimate, m = cd gn m 2/rd2, of the
mass shift of a massive string state due to the exchange of long range elds (graviton,
dilaton and axion). [the exchange of these elds is expected to be the most important one
both because very excited string states tend to be large, and because the corresponding
interactions are attractive and cumulative with the mass.]

conceptually, the main new result of this paper concerns the most probable state of
a very massive single18 self-gravitating string. by combining our estimates of the entropy
reduction due to the size constraint, and of the mass shift we come up with the expression
(4.4) for the logarithm of the number of self-gravitating string states of size r. our analysis
of the function s(m, r) claries the correspondence [6], [8], [9], [13] between string states
and black holes. in particular, our results conrm many of the results of [13], but make
them (in our opinion) physically clearer by dealing directly with the size distribution, in
real space, of an ensemble of string states. when our results dier from those of [13], they
do so in a way which simplies the physical picture and make even more compelling the
existence of a correspondence between strings and black holes. for instance, [13] suggested
0  m 1/2 for the
that in d = 5 there was a phenomenon of hysteresis, with a critical value g2
string  black hole transition, and a dierent critical value g2
c  m 1  g2
0 for the inverse
transition: black hole  string. also, [13] suggested that in d > 6, most excited string states
would never form black holes. the simple physical picture suggested19 by our results is the
following: in any dimension, if we start with a massive string state and increase the string
coupling g, a typical string state will, eventually, become more compact and will end up,
when c = g2
. note
that the basic reason why small strings, r  1, dominate in any dimension the entropy when
  1 is that they descend from string states with bare mass m0  m(1 + /rd2)  2m
which are exponentially more numerous than less condensed string states corresponding to
smaller bare masses.

c m  1, in a condensed state of size r  1, and mass density   g2

c

the nature of the transition between the initial dilute state and the nal condensed

nl = nr, would have complicated the denition of the grand canonical ensemble we used. we
expect that our results (whichare semi-classical) apply (with some numerical changes) to open or
closed superstrings.

18we consider states of a single string because, for large values of the mass, the single-string
entropy approximates the total entropy up to subleading terms.

19our conclusions are not rigourously established because they rely on assuming the validity of
the result (4.4) beyond the domain (r2  1, g2 m/rd2  1) where it was derived. however,
we nd heuristically convincing to believe in the presence of a reduction factor of the type 1 r2
down to sizes very near the string scale. our heuristic dealing with self-gravity is less compelling
because we do not have a clear signal of when strong gravitational eld eects become essential.

[as explained below eq. (4.4), we
one depends on the value of the space dimension d.
henceforth set to unity, by suitable redenitions of s, r and g, the coecients c1, c2 and
in d = 3, the transition is gradual: when  < m 1/2 the size of a typical state is
c3.]
r(d=3)
 m 1/2(1m 1/2 /8), when  > m 1/2 the typical size is r(d=3)
 (1+(1+3 2)1/2)/.
in d = 4, the transition toward a condensed state is still continuous, but most of the size
evolution takes place very near  = 1: when  < 1, r(d=4)
 m 1/2(1  )1/4, and when
 > 1,r(d=4)
 (2/(  1))1/2, with some smooth blending between the two evolutions
around |  1|  m 2/3. in d  5, the transition is discontinuous (like a rst order phase
transition between, say, gas and liquid states). barring the consideration of metastable
(supercooled) states, on expects that when  = 2  /(  1)1 (with  = (d  2)/2),
the most probable size of a string state will jump from rrw (when  < 2) to a size of order
unity (when  > 2).







let us, for deniteness, write down in more detail what happens in d = 3. after maxi-
mization over r, the entropy of a self-gravitating string is given, when m 3/2  g2  m 1,
by

s(m) = s(m, r(m))  a0 m(cid:20)1 +

1
4

(g2 m)2(cid:21) .

(5.1)

(5.2)

by dierentiating s with respect to m, one nds the temperature of the ensemble of highly
excited single string states of mass m:

t  thag(cid:18)1 

3
4

(g2 m)2(cid:19) ,

with thag  a1
0 . eq. (5.2) explicitly exhibits the modication of the hagedorn tempera-
ture due to self-gravity (in agreement with results of [13] obtained by a completely dierent
approach). note that, both in eqs. (5.1) and (5.2), the self-gravity modications are frac-
tionally of order unity at the transition g2 m  1.
one can think of the condensed state of (single) string matter, reached (in any d)
when   1, as an analog of a neutron star with respect to an ordinary star (or a white
dwarf). it is very compact (because of self gravity) but it is stable (in some range for g)
under gravitational collapse. however, if one further increases g or m (in fact,  = g2 m),
the condensed string state is expected (when  reaches some 3 > 2, 3 = o(1)) to
collapse down to a black hole state (analogously to a neutron star collapsing to a black
hole when its mass exceeds the landau-oppenheimer-volko critical mass). still in analogy
with neutron stars, one notes that general relativistic strong gravitational eld eects are
crucial for determining the onset of gravitational collapse; indeed, under the newtonian
approximation (4.4), the condensed string state could continue to exist for arbitrary large
values of .

it is interesting to note that the value of the mass density at the formation of the
condensed string state is   g2. this is reminiscent of the prediction by atick and witten
[23] of a rst-order phase transition of a self-gravitating thermal gas of strings, near the
hagedorn temperature20, towards a dense state with energy density   g2 (typical of a

20note that, by denition, in our single string system, the formal temperature t = (s/m )1

25

genus-zero contribution to the free energy). ref. [23] suggested that this transition is rst-
order because of the coupling to the dilaton. this suggestion agrees with our nding of a
discontinuous transition to the single string condensed state in dimensions  5 (ref. [23]
work in higher dimensions, d = 25 for the bosonic case). it would be interesting to deepen
these links between self-gravitating single string states and multi-string states.

assuming the existence (conrmed by the present work) of a dense state of self-
gravitating string matter with energy density   g2, it would be fascinating to be able to
explore in detail (with appropriate, strong gravity tools) its gravitational dynamics, both in
the present context of a single, isolated object (collapse problem), and in the cosmological
context (problem of the origin of the expansion of the universe).

let us come back to the consequences of the picture brought by the present work for
the problem of the end point of the evaporation of a schwarzschild black hole and the
interpretation of black hole entropy. in that case one xes the value of g (assumed to be
 1) and considers a black hole which slowly looses its mass via hawking radiation. when
the mass gets as low as a value21 m  g2, for which the radius of the black hole is of
order one (in string units), one expects the black hole to transform (in all dimensions) into
a typical string22 state corresponding to  = g2 m  1, which is a dense state (still of radius
r  1). this string state will further decay and loose mass, predominantly via the emission
of massless quanta, with a quasi thermal spectrum with temperature t  thagedorn = a1
(see eq. (3.29) and refs. [8], [22]) which smoothly matches the previous black hole hawking
temperature. this mass loss will further decrease the product  = g2 m, and this decrease
will, either gradually or suddenly, cause the initially compact string state to inate to much

larger sizes. for instance, if d  4, the string state will quickly inate to a size r  m.
later, with continued mass loss, the string size will slowly shrink again toward r  1 until
a remaining string of mass m  1 nally decays into stable massless quanta. in this picture,
the black hole entropy acquires a somewhat clear statistical signicance (as the degeneracy
of a corresponding typical string state) only when m and g are related by g2 m  1. if
we allow ourselves to vary (in a gedanken experiment) the value of g this gives a potential
statistical signicance to any black hole entropy value sbh (by choosing g2  s1
bh). we
do not claim, however, to have a clear idea of the direct statistical meaning of sbh when
g2 sbh  1. neither do we clearly understand the fate of the very large space (which
could be excited in many ways) which resides inside very large classical black holes of radius
rbh  (g2 sbh)1/(d1)  1. the fact that the interior of a black hole of given mass could be

0

is always near the hagedorn temperature.

21note that the mass at the black hole  string transition is larger than the planck mass mp 
(gn )1/2  g1 by a factor g1  1.
22a check on the single-string dominance of the transition black hole  string is to note that
the single string entropy  m/ms is much larger than the entropy of a ball of radiation srad 
(rm )d/(d+1) with size r  rbh  s at the transition.

26

arbitrarily large23, and therefore arbitrarily complex, suggests that black hole physics is not
exhausted by the idea (conrmed in the present paper) of a reversible transition between
string-length-size black holes and string states.

on the string side, we also do not clearly understand how one could follow in detail (in
the present non bps framework) the transformation of a strongly self-gravitating string
state into a black hole state.

finally, let us note that we expect that self-gravity will lift nearly completely the de-
generacy of string states.
[the degeneracy linked to the rotational symmetry, i.e. 2j + 1
in d = 3, is probably the only one to remain, and it is negligible compared to the string
entropy.] therefore we expect that the separation  e between subsequent (string and black
hole) energy levels will be exponentially small:  e   m exp(s(m)), where  m is
the canonical-ensemble uctuation in m. such a  e is negligibly small compared to the
radiative width   g2 m of the levels. this seems to mean that the discreteness of the
quantum levels of strongly self-gravitating strings and black holes is very much blurred, and
dicult to see observationally.
