abstract

gorsky et al. presented an explicit construction of whitham deformations of the

seiberg-witten curve for the su (n +1) n = 2 susy yang-mills theory. we extend

their result to all classical gauge groups and some other cases such as the spectral
curve of the a(2)

2n ane toda toda system. our construction, too, uses fractional
powers of the superpotential w (x) that characterizes the curve. we also consider

the u-plane integral of topologically twisted theories on four-dimensional manifolds
x with b+

2 (x) = 1 in the language of these explicitly constructed whitham defor-

mations and an integrable hierarchy of the kdv type hidden behind.

1 introduction

the geometry of seiberg and wittens low energy eective theory of the four-dimensional

n = 2 susy yang-mills theories (with and without matters) [1] are based on complex

algebraic curves now generally called the seiberg-witten curves. coordinates of the

moduli space (coulomb branch) u of these curves are given by the casimirs uj (j =

1,    , n = rank(g)) of the scalar eld  of the n = 2 vector multiplet. each curve

carries a special meromorphic dierential (the seiberg-witten dierential) dssw. given

a suitable set of cycles aj, bj (j = 1,    , n), this dierential dssw induces a special

geometry on the moduli space u. the special coordinates are given by the period
integrals aj and ad

j of dssw along these cycles. the prepotential f of the low energy

eective theory is determined by this special geometry.

gorsky et al. [2] and martinec and warner [3] discovered that an integrable system,

typically an ane tida system, is hidden behind this geometric setup. this point of view

soon turned out to be very useful not only for studying various four-dimensional n = 2

susy gauge theories [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13] but also for elucidating a universal

mathematical structure underlying those examples [14, 15]. in fact, all the building blocks

of the seiberg-witten theory t to the language of integrable systems. the seiberg-witten

curve is nothing but the spectral curve of the integrable system. the dierential dssw is

related to its complex symplectic structure. the special coordinates aj are identied with

the action variables; the angle variables live on an abelian subvariety (called the special

or distinguished prym variety) of the jacobi variety of the seiberg-witten curve. the

casimirs uj give an involutive set of hamiltonians. the commuting ows generated by

these hamiltonians sweep out the aforementioned prym variety.

in a more geometric

language, the phase space x has a lagrangian bration x  u by these n-dimensional

complex lieouville tori.

this link with integrable systems implies the existence of another kind of deformations

of the seiberg-witten curves: whitham deformations [2, 3, 4, 9, 10] the dierential

equations that characterize these deformations, are called whitham equations. these

deformations are parametrized by an extra set of variables tn (n = 1, 2,   ). these

variables are referred to as slow variables in the theory of whitham equations; fast

variables tn are the time variables of commuting hamiltonian ows in the integrable

2

system (or an integrable hierarchy).

several interesting physical interpretations of these whitham deformations have been

proposed. deformations by t1 are identied to be the renormalization group ows [16, 17,

6, 18, 13]. in this sense, the other whitham deformations may be thought of as generalized

rg ows. gorsky et al. [19] constructed an explicit solution of the whitham equations for

the the su(n + 1) seiberg-witten curve, and argued its relation to topologically twisted

gauge theories. edelestein et al. [20] interpreted the whitham deformations of gorsky et

al. as soft breaking of n = 2 susy by spurion elds.

in this paper we generalize the construction of gorsky et al.

[19] to other classical

gauge groups. we consider the n = 2 susy yang-mills theories in the vector represen-

tation of classical gauge groups. as martinec and warner pointed out [3], the seiberg-

witten curves for these theories can be written in a unied form, see (2.1), which is

essentially the spectral curves of ane toda systems. this expression contains a po-

tential w (x) (called the superpotential in analogy with topological landau-ginzburg

theories of a-d-e singularities). in the case of the su(n +1) seiberg-witten curve, w (x)

is a polynomial. gorsky et al. use fractional powers of w (x) very ingeniously. actually,

their method work for a general rational superpotential. we demonstrate it in the case of

the seiberg-witten curves for other classical gauge groups and some other toda spectral

curves.

we also address another issue that is raised in our previous paper [21]. as discussed

therein, an interesting interplay of the slow variables tn and the fast variables tn

can be observed in the u-plane integral of the topologically twisted theories on four-
dimensional manifolds x with b+

2 (x) is the self-dual part of the
2nd betti number.) our consideration in the previous paper was limited to the case of

2 (x) = 1 [22, 23, 24]. (b+

su(n + 1). we revisit this issue, now armed with the explicit construction of whitham

deformations for all classical gauge groups.

this paper is organized as follows. section 2 is a collection of basic mathematical

notions concerning seiberb-witten curves. particularly important are the prym varieties

and related dierentials that are crucial in handling the cases other than su(n + 1).

section 3 is a review of the construction of gorsky et al. we present all technical details,

which are used in the subsequent sections. in section 4 we consider the case of the so(2n)

3

seiberg-witten curve in detail. section 5 deals with the case of so(2n + 1) and sp(2n),

along with some other cases that are not directly related to n = 2 susy yang-mills

theories but can be treated similarly. in section 6 we consider the u-plane integral of the

topologically twisted theories. section 7 is devoted to discussions. appendix is added to

show a precise form of the spectral curves of the ane toda systems in the usual lax

formalism.

2 curves, dierentials, and prym varieties

2.1 various complex algebraic curves

the seiberg-witten curves of n = 2 susy yang-mills theories in the vector representa-

tion of classical gauge groups can be written in the following common form [3]:

z +

= w (x).

(2.1)

here  is some power of the renormalization group parameter , and w (x) (the super-

potential) a polynomial or a laurent polynomial of the following form:

for the other gauge groups may be identied with the characteristic polynomial det(xi 

) of the scalar eld  of the n = 2 susy vector multiplet. the coecients uj are

accordingly the expectation value of the casimirs of . in the case of su(n + 1) and

so(2n), w (x) coincides with the superpotential of the topological landau-ginzburg

theories (or d < 1 strings) of singularities of the a and d type [25, 26]. because of this,

w (x) is referred to as the superpotential.

as martinec and warner pointed out [3], these curves coincide with the spectral curves

of the ane toda system of the type g

(1) dual to the the untwisted ane lie algebra

(1) of the gauge group g. in particular, the ane toda systems for the non-simply-laced
g
gauge groups so(2n + 1) and sp(2n) are of the twisted ane type b(1)
c (1)
n = d(2)
have spectral curves of the above form:

all these curves are hyperelliptic. the following is an equivalent expression in the usual

expression y2 = r(x) of hyperelliptic curves. actually, it is in this form (or a quotient

curve discussed later on) that the seiberg-witten curves for classical gauge groups were

rst derived [28, 29, 30, 31].

1. the seiberg-witten curves:

su(n + 1)

: y2 = p (x)2  42, z = (p (x) + y)/2.

so(2n + 1)

: y2 = q(x2)2  42x2, z = (q(x2) + y)/2x.

sp(2n)

: y2 = q(x2)(x2q(x2) + 4), z = (2 + x2q(x2) + xy)/2.

so(2n)

: y2 = q(x2)2  42x4, z = (q(x2) + y)/2.

2. other ane toda spectral curves:

b(1)

n , c (1)
n
a(2)

: y2 = q(x2)2  42, z = (q(x2) + y)/2.

2n : y2 = x2q(x2)2  42, z = (xq(x2) + y)/2.

5

the curves other than the su(n + 1) seiberg-witten curve can be classied into two

groups:

 a: the sp(2n) seiberg-witten curve and the a(2)

2n -toda curve.

 b: the other curves.

we shall show that the curves in the two groups exhibit dierent properties in many

aspects. the rst aspect that we now point out, is their genera:

 case a: the curve has genus 2n.

 case b: the curve has genus 2n  1.

2.2

involutions and prym varieties

the above curves, which we denote by c, have several involutions. common to all are

the hyperelliptic involution

1 :

(x, y) 7 (x, y),

(x, z) 7 (x, 2/z).

all the curves other than the su(n + 1) curves have the second involution

2 :

(x, y) 7 (x, y),

(x, z) 7 (x, z).

(2.5)

(2.6)

the quotient c2 = c/2 by the second involution is also a hyperelliptic curve. it has

dierent properties in accordance with the above classication:

 case a: c2 has genus n, and the covering map c  c2 is unramied.

 case b: c2 has genus n  1, and the covering map c  c2 is ramied.

the double covering c  c2 determines the prym variety prym(c/c2). this is an

n-dimensional abelian variety, which plays the role of the jacobi variety jac(c) for the

su(n + 1) yang-mills theory. (fays book [32] provides us with useful information on

this kind of prym varieties.) following fays book, let us specify the structure of this

prym variety in more detail.

the algebro-geometric denition of this prym variety is based on an automorphism

2 : jac(c)  jac(c) induced by the involution 2. consider the jacobi variety as

6

the set of the linear equivalence classes of divisors d of degree zero. the prym variety

prym(c/c2), by denition, is the image of id  2 (where id is the identity map), namely,

consists of the linear equivalence classses of divisors of the form d  2(d).

an equivalent complex analytic expression is the complex torus

prym(c/c2)  cn /(zn + 2p zn ),

(2.7)

where  is a diagonal matrix  = diag(d1,    , dn ) with positive integers on the diagonal

line, and p is a complex symmetric matrix (pjk) with positive denite imaginary part.

this prym variety is thus a polarized abelian variety with the following polarization

(d1,    , dn ):

 case a: (d1,    , dn ) = (2,    , 2, 2).

 case b: (d1,    , dn ) = (2,    , 2, 1).

in particular, case a is substantially a principally polarized abelian variety with period

matrix p; the above expression is simply for dealing with the two cases in a unied way.

the matrix elements of p are period integrals of holomorphic dierentials dj (j =

1,    , n) that are odd under the action of 2:


2dj = dj.

these dierentials are uniquely determined by the normalization condition

and the matrix elements pjk of p are given by

dk = jk,

iaj

(2.8)

(2.9)

(2.10)

pjk =

dk.

dj

2 ibj

the 2n cycles aj, bj (j = 1,    , n) in these period integrals have to be chosen as follows:

 case a: the 4n cycles aj, 2(aj), bj, 2(bj) (j = 1,    , n) form a symplectic

basis of cycles of c.

 case b: the homology classes [an ] and [bn ] are odd under the action of 2, i.e.,

2([an ]) = [an ] and 2([bn ]) = [bn ]. the 4n2 cycles aj, 2(aj), bj, 2(bj)

(j = 1,    , n  1) and an , bn altogether form a symplectic basis of cycles of c.

in particular, these cycles have the intersection numbers aj  ak = bj  bk = 0 and

aj  bk = jk.

2.3 seiberg-witten dierential

the seiberg-witten dierential is given by

dssw = x

dz
z

=

xw (x)dx

pw (x)2  42

the following list shows a more explicit form of this dierential.

.

(2.11)

su(n + 1)

: dssw = xp (x)

dx
y

so(2n + 1)

so(2n)

2. for the other toda curves:

.

y

: dssw =(cid:16)2q(x2)x2  q(x2)(cid:17)dx
: dssw = x(cid:16)2q(x2)x2 + 2q(x2)(cid:17) dx
: dssw =(cid:16)2q(x2)x2  2q(x2)(cid:17)dx

y

a(2)

2n : dssw = x(cid:16)2q(x2)x2 + q(x2)(cid:17)dx

y

.

here the prime means dierentiating by x, i.e., p (x) = dp (x)/dx, etc.

a fundamental property of this dierential is that it generates holomorphic dierentials

on c as follows. let (/uj)   |z=const. denote dierentiating the quantity inside by uj
while keeping z constant. for the seiberg-witten dierential, this gives


uj

dssw|z=const. =

x

uj(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)z=const.

dz
z

= 

w (x)/uj
w (x)/x

xw (x)dx

pw (x)2  42

.

(2.12)

here we have also used the relation

w (x)

uj

+

w (x)

x

x

uj(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)z=const.

= 0,

(2.13)

which follows from the equation of the curve c. one can verify, for each case presented

above, that all these dierentials for j = 1,    , n are holomorphic dierentials. in the

case of the su(n +1) seiberg-witten curve, these n holomorphic dierentials form a basis

8

of the space of holomorphic dierentials on c. in the other cases, these dierentials are

also linearly independent, but odd under the action of 2, because the seiberg-witten

dierential itself is also odd:


2dssw = dssw.

(2.14)

the uj-derivatives (2.12) give a basis of odd holomorphic dierentials (also called prym

dierentials).

given a set of cycles aj and bj mentioned above, one can dene the special coordinates

aj and their duals ad

j on the moduli space u as follows:

aj =iaj

dssw,

ad

j =ibj

dssw.

(2.15)

the n functions aj (j = 1,    , n), as well as the ad

j s, are functionally independent and
give a local coordinate system on u. dierentiating the seiberg-witten dierential now

by ajs give the normalized holomorphic dierentials dj:

the prepotential f = f (a1,    , an ) is dened by the dierential equations


aj

dssw(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)z=const.

= dj.

f
aj

= ad
j .

(2.16)

(2.17)

the matrix elements pjk of p can be expressed as second derivatives of the prepotential:

pjk =

2f

ajak

.

(2.18)

2.4 quotient curve of genus n

the prym variety prym(c/c2) is isogenous to the jacobi variety jac(c ) of the quotient
curve c  = c/ by the following involution :

 case a:  = 2.

 case b:  = 12.

9

the quotient curve c  is also hyperelliptic and has genus n. the matrix p is actually

the period matrix of the jacobi variety jac(c ):

jac(c )  cn /(zn + p zn ).

(2.19)

the dierentials dssw and dj are even (i.e., invariant) under the action of , so that
they are the pull-back of dierentials on c . on the other hand, the homology classses

[aj] and [bj] are mapped by the projection p : c  c  to an integer multiple of the
homology classes [a

j] of a symplectic basis on c . more precisely,

j] and [b

p([aj]) =

2
dj

[a

j],

p([bj]) =

2
dj

[b

j].

(2.20)

this is the origin of the factor dj/2 in the period integral representation of the matrix

elements of p.

the equation of the quotient curve c  can be written out in terms of the following

two invariants  and  of :

 case a:  = x2,  = y.

 case b:  = x2,  = xy.

the following equations of the quotient curves c  are thus derived.

1. for seiberg-witten curves:

so(2n + 1)

sp(2n)

so(2n)

: 2 = (cid:16)q(2)  42(cid:17).
: 2 = q()(cid:16)q() + 4(cid:17).
: 2 = (cid:16)q()2  422(cid:17).

2. for the other toda curves:

b(1)

n , c (1)
n
a(2)

: 2 = (cid:16)q()2  42(cid:17).

2n : 2 = q()2  42.

note that the curves c and c  exhibit somewhat dierent characteristics. the curve

c, viewed as a double covering of the x-sphere, has two points p and q at innity

10

above x = . these two points correspond to z =  and z = 0, and mapped to each

other by the hyperelliptic involution 1. this is a typical characteristic of the spectral

curves of ane toda systems. the curve c , in contrast, has a single point at innity

above the -shere. in particular, c  is branched over  = . hyperelliptic curves of this

type arise in the kdv hierarchy. as well known, the kdv hierarchy is a special case of

the kp hierarchy with only the odd time variables t2n+1 being left nontrivial.

the su(2) curve is however exceptional: it has the involution 2. by this accidental
symmetry, one can construct the quotient curve c  = c/ with  = 12, which can be

written

2 = (cid:16)(  u2)2  42(cid:17)

(2.21)

in terms of the invariants  = x2 and  = xy. by shifting  7   u2, this turns into the

substantially the same curve

2 = ( + u2)(  2)( + 2)

(2.22)

as seiberg and witten rst derived [1]. as gorsky et al. noted [2], this curve appears in

a classical study on modulations of elliptic solutions of the kdv equation.

3 whitham deformations of su (n + 1) curve

3.1 setup and results of gorsky et al.

the whitham deformations for the su(n + 1) seiberg-witten curve takes the form


aj

ds(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)z=const.

= dj,


tn

ds(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)z=const.

= dn.

(3.1)

the precise setup is as follows:

1. the moduli ~u = (u1,    , un ) are now understood to be functions uj(~a, ~t ) of ~a =
(a1,    , an ) and ~t = (t1, t2,   ). the new parameters tn are the slow variables
in the theory of whitham equations. these deformed moduli uj = uj(~a, ~t ) are
required to reduce to the seiberg-witten moduli uj = uj(~a) (i.e., the inverse of the
period map ~u  ~a from the ~u-space to the ~a-space) at ~t = (1, 0, 0,   ).

11

2. dn are meromorphic dierentials of the second kind with poles at the two points

p and q only, and normalized to have zero aj periods:

dn = 0

(j = 1,    , n).

(3.2)

iaj

3. dj are the normalized holomorphic dierentials on the curve c.

4. the dierential ds is a linear combination of these dierentials of the form

tndn +

ds =xn1

n

xj=1

ajdj,

(3.3)

and required to reduce to the seiberg-witten dierential dssw at the point ~t =
(1, 0, 0,   ).

the solution of gorsky et al.

[19] for the su(n + 1) seiberg-witten curve is con-

structed by the following steps.

1. consider the meromorphic dierentials

d n = rn(x)

dz
z

, rn(x) =(cid:16)p (x)n/(n +1)(cid:17)+

.

(3.4)

here (  )+ denotes the polynomial part of a laurent series of x. the fractional
power of p (x) is understood to be a laurent series of the form xn +    at x = .
since r1(x) = x, d 1 is nothing but the seiberg-witten dierential. as in the case
of the seiberg-witten dierential (2.12), the u-derivatives of these meromorphic

dierentials turn out to be holomorphic dierentials.

2. consider the dierential

and its period integrals

tnd n

ds =xn1

aj =iaj

ds =xn1

tniaj

d n.

(3.5)

(3.6)

these period integrals are functions of the moduli uj and the deformation parame-

ters tn. they determine a family of deformations of the seiberg-witten period map

~u 7 ~a with parametes tn.

12

3. the period map ~u 7 ~a from the ~u-space to the ~a-space is invertible if ~t is close to

(1, 0, 0,   ), because the seiberg-witten period map at this point is invertible. the

inverse map ~a 7 ~u = (cid:16)u1(~a, ~t ),    , un (~a, ~t )(cid:17) give deformations of the seiberg-

witten moduli uj = uj(~a), hence of the curve c, with parameters tn.

4. the dierentials

n

dn = d n 

c(n)
j dj,

c(n)

j =iaj

d n

(3.7)

xj=1

satisfy the required normalization condition.

5. ds is now a linear combination of dn and dj of the required form.

the outcome is the following theorem:

theorem 1 the dierential ds satises the whitham equations (3.1) under the defor-

mations of the curve c thus constructed.

we review the proof of this result in the rest of this section.

3.2 dierentiating d n by moduli

the rst, and most essential step is to derive the following property of d n. note that
ujs and tns are now understood to be independent variables.

lemma 1 (/uj)d n|z=const. are holomorphic dierentials on c.

proof. we rst derive a set of conditions that the polynomial rn(x) should satisfy, and

verify that they are indeed fullled. dierentiating the eqution of the curve c gives the

relation

p (x)

uj

+

p (x)

x

x

uj(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)z=const.

threfore, recalling that dz/z = p (x)dx/y, one can rewrite the uj-derivative of d n as
follows:

= 0.

(3.8)


uj

d n(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)z=const.

uj

= (cid:18)rn(x)
= (cid:18)rn(x)
= (cid:18)rn(x)

(3.9)

for this dierential to be a holomorphic dierential on c, therefore, the polynomial rn(x)

has to satisfy the following condition:

deg(cid:18)rn(x)

uj

p (x) + r

n(x)xn +1j(cid:19)  n  1.

(3.10)

let us conrm that rn(x) = (cid:16)p (x)n/(n +1)(cid:17)+

(  )+, rn(x) can be written

has this property. by the denition of

rn(x) = p (x)n/(n +1) + o(x1).

dierentiating this relation by x and uj, respectively, gives

r

n(x) =

p (x)(nn 1)/(n +1)p (x) + o(x2),

n

n + 1
n

n + 1

rn(x)

uj

= 

p (x)(nn 1)/(n +1)xn +1j + o(x1).

(3.11)

from these relations, one can easily see that the above condition is certainly satised.

q.e.d.

3.3 deriving whitham equations

once d n turns out to have the aforementioned property, deriving the whitham equations
(3.1) is rather straightforward. let us present this calculation following the work of

itoyama and morozov [9].

first, since that dj (j = 1,    , n) give a basis of the space of holomorphic dieren-

tials, the holomorphic dierentials in the above lemma can be written

3.4 prepotential and homogeneity

the prepotential f = f (a, t ) is dened by the equations

f
aj

=ibj

ds,

f
tn

= ip

fn(z)ds iq

gn(z)ds.

(3.17)

p and q are the two points at innity (z =  and z = 0); hp

along a small closed path encircling the indicated point once in the anti-clockwise direc-

and hq

are integrals

tion. fn(z) and gn(z) are laurent polynomials that represent the singular part of dn at

p and q:

dn = dfn(z) + holomorphic

(p  p),

dn = dgn(z) + holomorphic

(p  q).

(3.18)

these laurent polynomials have constant coecients for all n 1. to see this, let us note

that the fractional power of p (x) in rn(x) can be written

p (x)n/(n +1) =(cid:16)z +

2

z (cid:17)n/(n +1)

.

(3.19)

the singular part of laurent expansion of the right hand side at z =  or z = 0

determines the laurent polynomials fn(z) and gn(z). obviously the singular part is a

laurent polynomial with constant coecients, and accordingly fn(z) and gn(z), too, turn

out to have constant coecients. the compatibility of the above dening equations for

1our previous paper [21] contains a wrong comment on this fact.

16

f is ensured by riemanns bilinear relations. second derivatives of the prepotential are

also related to period integrals:

the construction of the whitham deformations also ensures the homogeneity

(3.21)

to see this, rst note that the period integrals aj = aj(~u, ~t ) have the obvious homogeneity

aj(~u,  ~t ) = aj(~u, ~t ).

(3.22)

acoordingly, uj = uj(~a, ~t ) are invariant under the rescaling of aj and tn, i.e., they are
homogeneous functions of degree zero:

uj(~u,  ~t ) = uj(~u, ~t ).

(3.23)

one can see, from these fact, that the period integrals on the right hand side of (3.17)

are homogeneous functions of degree one, so that the prepotential becomes homogeneous

of degree two (upon suitably normalizing the linear part).

4 whitham deformations of so(2n ) curve

4.1 setup and results

as warm-up, let us examine some fundamental properties of the seiberg-witten dieren-

tial dssw. the uj-derivatives of dssw can be written


uj

dssw(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)z=const.

=

=

x2n 2j2dx

px4q(x2)2  42

x2n 2jdx

y

(j = 1,    , n).

(4.1)

as expected, they are holomorphic dierentials on c. furthermore, like dssw itself, they

are invariant under the involution  : (x, y) 7 (x, y), and can be identied with

17

holomorphic dierentials on the quotient curve c  = c/ with coordinates  = x2 and

 = xy:


uj

dssw(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)z=const.

=

n jd

2

(j = 1,    , n).

(4.2)

following the method of gorsky et al., we now seek for a series of meromorphic

dierentials d n of the form

d n = rn(x)

dz
z

, rn(x) = polynomial,

(4.3)

with the same properties. as one can see by careful inspection of the proof in the su(n +

1) seiberg-witten curve, the fractional power construction persists to be meaningful even

if the polynomial p (x) is replaced by a rational (or laurent series) superpotential w (x).

a new feature in the present setup is the parity; for the dierential to be invariant under

, the polynomial rn(x) has to be odd,

rn(x) = rn(x).

(4.4)

the superpotential w (x) is even, and the leading term is x2n 2. we are thus led to the

following:

rn(x) =(cid:16)w (x)(2n1)/(2n 2)(cid:17)+

(n = 1, 2,   ).

(4.5)

note that these polynomials are indeed odd polynomials. furthremore, r1(x) = x, so
that in this case, too, d 1 is equal to the seiberg-witten dierential.

lemma 2 (/uj)d n|z=const. are holomorphic dierentials on c, and invariant under
the involution .

proof. we can proceed in mostly the same way as the case of the su(n +1) seiberg-witten
curve. the uj-derivatives of d n can be written


uj

d n(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)z=const.

=(cid:18)x2 rn(x)

uj

w (x)  x2r

n(x)

w (x)

uj (cid:19) dx

y

.

(4.6)

the proof now boilds down to verifying the following two statements:

1. the factor in front of dx/y is a polynomial.

18

2. the degree of this polynomial does not exceed 2n  2.

let us consider the rst statement. the problem is that w (x)/uj and w (x) respec-
tively have a pole of second and third order at x = 0. rn(x)/uj and r

n(x), however,
have a zero at x = 0, because rn(x) is an odd polynomial and has no constant term.
therefore, along with the factor x2, they cancel the pole of at most third order of the

other two functions. the second statement can be veried by the same reasoning as the

proof for the the su(n + 1) seiberg-witten curve. q.e.d.

4.2 whitham deformations

having obtained the meromorphic dierentials d n with the aforementioned properties,
we can now construct a family of whitham deformations.

the construction is parallel to the case of the su(n + 1) seiberg-witten curve:

1. consider the dierential

and its period integrals

tnd n.

ds =xn1

aj =iaj

ds =xn1

tniaj

d n.

(4.7)

(4.8)

the period integrals aj = aj(~u, ~t ) determine a period map ~u 7 ~a from the ~u-space
to the ~a-space.

2. the period map ~u 7 ~a is invertible if ~t is close to (1, 0, 0,   ). the inverse map

~a 7 ~u =(cid:16)u1(~a, ~t ),    , un (~a, ~t )(cid:17) give deformations of the curve c with parameters

~t .

3. the dierentials

dn = d n 

c(n)
j dj,

n

xj=1

c(n)

j =iaj

d n,

(4.9)

satisfy the normalization condition

dn = 0

(j = 1,    , n).

(4.10)

iaj

19

4. eventually, the dierential ds can be written

tndn +

ds =xn1

n

xj=1

ajdj.

(4.11)

the following can be proven in exactly the same way as the proof for the su(n + 1)

seiberg-witten curve:

theorem 2 the dierential ds satises the whitham equations

ds(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)z=const.

tn

ds(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)z=const.

= dn,

(4.12)

4.3 relation to kdv hierarchy

by construction, the dierentials ds, d n, dn and dj are all invariant under the in-
volution . accordingly, they actually descend to (or, equivalently, are the pull-back

of) dierentials on the quotient curve c  = c/. in particular, the counterpart of dj

are also holomorphic, and, as already mentioned, form a normalized basis of holomorphic

dierentials on c .

the meromorphic dierentials dn possess an even more interesting interpretation.

thy correspond to meromorphic dierentials on c  with a single pole at  =  (which

is the image of p and q). recall that this is a branch point of the covering map of

c  over the -sphere. this is substantially the same setup that emerges in hyperelliptic

solutions of the kdv hierarchy. those hyperelliptic solutions are constructed from a theta

function and a series of meromorphic dierentials dkdv

n

(n = 1, 2,   ) with a single pole

(of order 2n) at a xed branch point (such as the point  = ) of the hyperelliptic curve.

in this respect, we should have numbered the deformation variables as t1, t3, t5,   

rather than t1, t2, t3,   , following the usual numbering of the time variables in the kdv

hierarchy. note that the odd numbers correspond to the degrees 2n  1 of powers of
w (x)1/(2n 2) in the denition of rn(x).

we must, however, also add that our meromorphic dierentials are not exactly the

same as those in the standard formulation of the kdv hierarchy. the meromorphic

20

dierentials dkdv

n

in the standard setup are normalized as

dkdv

n = dn(1/2) + holomorphic

(4.13)

at  = . our meromorphic dierentials dn are not of this form; they are a linear
combination of dkdv

. accordingly, the fast and slow time variables are also a linear

n

combination of the standard ones.

these remarks also apply to the other cases where the essential part of the theory is

described by the quotient curve c  of the kdv type.

5 non-simply-laced gauge groups and some other

cases

5.1 so(2n + 1) and sp(2n )

the case of the non-simply-laced gauge groups so(2n + 1) and sp(2n) can be treated in

almost the same way as the case of so(2n). the curve c has the involution , and the

quotient curve c  = c/ has genus n. the seiberg-witten dierential dssw is invariant

under this involution. our rst task is to construct meromorphic dierentials

d n = rn(x)

dz
z

, rn(x) = odd polynomial,

(5.1)

whose uj-derivatives are holomorphic dierentials on c.

the polynomials rn(x) are again given by the polynomial part of fractional powers of

the superpotential w (x):

so(2n + 1)

sp(2n)

: rn(x) =(cid:16)w (x)(2n1)/(2n 1)(cid:17)+
: rn(x) =(cid:16)w (x)(2n1)/(2n +2)(cid:17)+

.

.

(5.2)

(5.3)

the uj-derivatives can be written as follows:

1. for so(2n + 1),


uj

d n(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)z=const.

= (cid:18)x

rn(x)

uj

w (x)  xr

n(x)

21

w (x)

uj (cid:19) dx

y

.

(5.4)

2. for sp(2n),


uj

d n(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)z=const.

= (cid:18)x1 rn(x)

uj

w (x)  x1r

n(x)

w (x)

uj (cid:19) dx

y

.

(5.5)

the prefactor of dx/y turns out to be a polynomial of degree  2n  2 and  2n  1 for

so(2n + 1) and sp(2n), respectively. therefore the above dierentials are holomorphic

dierentials on c.

the whitham deformations of c are given by the inverse period map ~a 7 ~u of the

period integrals

of the dierential

aj =iaj

ds =xn1

tniaj

d n.

tnd n.

ds =xn1

the normalized meromorphic dierentials dn are given by

dn = d n 

c(n)

c(n)

j =iaj

d n.

now ds can be written

(5.10)

under the deformations of the curve c by the inverse period map ~a 7 ~u.

5.2 some other cases

the same fractional power construction of whitham deformations also applies to the
toda curves for other classical ane lie algebras, namely, b(1)

n , c (1)

n and a(2)

2n . the

22

meromorphic dierentials d n are obtained in the same form as the other cases. the
polynomials rn(x) are given by the following:

b(1)

n , c (1)

a(2)

n

: w (x) =(cid:16)w (x)(2n1)/(2n )(cid:17)+
2n : w (x) =(cid:16)w (x)(2n1)/(2n +1)(cid:17)+

,

.

(5.11)

the case of the a(2)

2n (also called bcn ) toda curve, seems to be particularly interesting
and mysterious. although this does not appear in the list of ordinary n = 2 susy yang-

mills theories, an m-theoretical interpretation [33] might be possible.

actually, the same construction works with no problem for a more general rational

superpotential, e.g.,

m

w (x) = p (x) +

xk=1

vk

x  ck

.

(5.12)

note that the curve c is still hyperelliptic. this is a special case of m5-branes with

semi-innite d4 branes (arising from the poles of w (x)) on both sides of the stack of two

ns 5-branes.

5.3 yang-mills theories with fundamental matters

the seiberg-witten curve does not take the previous form (2.1) if fundamental matters

(hypermultiplets in the fundamental representation) exist. one can, however, rewrite the

curve in this form if w (x) can be an irrational function. let us examine this prescription

in the case of the su(n + 1) yang-mills theory with fundamental matters.

if the theory contains nf (< 2n) fundamental matters, the seiberg-witten curve

takes the form

where r(x) is the polynomial

z +

2r(x)

z

= p (x),

nf

r(x) =

(x + mi).

yi=1

(5.13)

(5.14)

this curve can be formally converted into the form of (2.1) by changing coordinates from

x and z to x and

w = z/pr(x).

23

(5.15)

the converted curve can be written

w +

2
w

= w (x) =

p (x)

pr(x)

,

(5.16)

thus an irrational superpotential arises. the role of z is now played by w. for instance,

the seiberg-witten dierential can be written

dssw = x

dw
w

.

(5.17)

since the superpotential itself is multi-valued, the fractional power construction re-

quires a more careful handling. this multi-valuedness is however relatively harmless,
simply aecting an overall multiplicative constant of the meromorphic dierentials d n.

6 topologically twisted gauge theories

6.1 donaldson-witten function and u-plane integral

correlation functions of topologically twisted gauge theories on a four-dimensional man-

ifold x can be collected into a generating function. this generating function is called

the donaldson-witten function. for instance, consider a 2-cycle observable i(s), s 

h2(x, z), and a 0-cycle observable o(p ), p  h0(x, z), of the form

i(s) = const.zs

g2 tr 2, o(p ) =xk

ck tr k(p ).

(6.1)

g is a transformation that generates a standard solution of the descent equations for

observables [22, 23]. the donaldson-witten function of these observables is the path

integral

zdw =dexp(cid:16)i(s) + o(p )(cid:17)e.

(6.2)

in the case with b+

2 (x) = 1, the donaldson-witten function becomes a sum of two

pieces:

zdw = zsw + zu.

(6.3)

the rst piece zsw is the contributions from the strong-coupling singularities of the

moduli space u (which is called the u-plane by abuse of the terminology for the su(2)

24

and so(3) gauge groups). the second piece zu is called the u-plane integral, which is
absent if b+

2 (x) > 1. this is the contributions from the whole moduli space u

according to moore and witten [22] (for su(2), so(3) gauge groups) and marino and

moore [23] (for other gauge groups), the u-plane integral for the above donaldson-witten

function zdw can be written

zu =zu

dadaab exp(u + s2t ),

(6.4)

where  and  are the euler number and the signature of x; a and b are modular forms

on u; u is a contribution from o(p ) only; t is a contact term which is induced by

the intersection of the 2-cycle s with itself, accordingly multiplied by the self-intersection

number s2;  is a lattice sum collecting the contributions of abelianized gauge leds and

other fermionic degrees of freedom.

6.2 blowup formula and tau function

marino and moore [23] pointed out that the blowup formula of the u-plane integral con-

tains a factor that can be interpreted as a special tau function of the ane toda system

(or, more precisely, an underlying integrable hierarchy). it should however be noted that

this is the interpretation in the case of the su(n + 1) gauge group.

the blowup formula connects the manifold x and its blowup x at a point q. x is
assumed to be a complex algebraic surface (e.g., cp2, cp1  cp1, del pezzo surfaces,
etc.). let b denote the exceptional divisor (i.e., inverse image of q) in x, and consider
the following donaldson-witten function function of x:

zdw =dexp(cid:16)ti(b) + i(s) + o(p )(cid:17)e.

note that this path integral is over the elds on x; the pull-back of i(s) and o(p ) to
x are denoted by the same notations. the new observable i(b) with support on b is

inserted with the coupling constant t. the blowup formula then shows that the integrand
of the u-plane integral for zdw is obtained by replacing

(6.5)

(6.6)

eu  eu

aj(cid:19)1/2

1/8et2t ,(cid:16) t

~v | p(cid:17)

in the u-plane integral for zdw. various terms on the right hand side of this rule have the

following meaning.  and  are some numerical constants;  is the discriminant of the

25

family of the curves c over u; ,(z | p) is the ordinary n-dimensional theta function
with characteristic (, ) and period matrix p; ~v is the gradient vector

aj(cid:19)
~v =(cid:18) v

(6.7)

of the gauge invariant potential v from which the integrand g2v of i(s) and i(b)

are constructed (e.g., v = tr 2 in the aforementioned usual setup of topological gauge

theories). for the su(n + 1) seiberg-witten curve, the matrix p is the period matrix

of jac(c); for the other classical gauge groups, the period matrix of prym(c/c2) (or

jac(c )) appears. the characteristics (, ) is determined by the physical setup; typically,

 = (0,    , 0) and  = (1/2,    , 1/2).

it is the product of the last two terms in (6.6) that marino and moore, in the case of

the su(n + 1) gauge group, identied to be the tau function of the ane toda system:

,(t) = et2t ,(cid:16) t

2

~v | p(cid:17).

(6.8)

thus, the coupling constant t plays the role of a time variable in the a(1)

n toda system.
for the other classical gauge groups, however, the relation to the ane toda systems is

slightly more complicated, as we discuss later on.

6.3 multi-time tau function as blowup factor

our previous paper [21] proposes a multi-time analogue of the single-time tau function

,(t) above.

in the present setup including all classical gauge groups, the multi-time

analogue can be written

,(t1, t2,   ) = exp(cid:16) 1

2 xm,n1

qmntmtn(cid:17),(cid:16)xn1

tn ~v (n) | p(cid:17).

(6.9)

the coecients qmn of the gaussian factor and the components of the directional vectors

~v (n) = (cid:16)v (n)

j (cid:17) are written in terms of period integrals of the meromorphic dierentials

dn that we have considered:

fn(z)dm 

gn(z)dm,

qmn = 

v (n)
j

=

2iip
2iip

fn(z)dj 

26

gn(z)dj.

(6.10)

by riemanns bilinear relation, v (n)

j

can also be written

v (n)
j =

1

2iibj

dn.

(6.11)

our proposal in the previous paper (for the su(n + 1) topological gauge theory) is to

interpret this tau function as the counterpart of marino and moores blowup factor ,(t)

for the donaldson-witten function

zdw =dexp(cid:16)xn1

tnin(b) + i(s) + o(p )(cid:17)e.

(6.12)

with many 2-cycles observables in(b) inserted. the observables in(b) are of the form

g2v (n),

(6.13)

and the directional vector ~v (n) is the gradient of the gauge invariant potential v (n),

in(b) = const.zb

~v (n)

j =(cid:16)v (n)
aj (cid:17).

(6.14)

this leads to the identication of the coecients qmn as the contact terms c(cid:16)v (m), v (n)(cid:17)

of higher casimir observables in the sense of losev et al. [24].

strong evidence supporting our proposal is that the above multi-time tau function has

a good modular property under the symplectic transformations

bj  ajkbk + bjkak,

aj  cjkbk + djkak, 


a b

c d 


 sp(2n, z).

(6.15)

of the cycles aj, bj. this is crucial for ensuring the correct modular property of the

integrand of the u-plane integral. under this symplectic transformation, indeed, the tau

function , transforms as

,(t1, t2,   )   det(cp + d)1/2 ,(t1, t2,   ),

(6.16)

where  (an 8th root of unity),  and  are determined by the sp(2n, z) matrix. this fact

can be conrmed in the same way as the proof in the case of the su(n + 1) topological

gauge theory [21].

it should be also mentioned that this modular property of the tau

function has been known for years [34, 35]. now the point is that the modular property

of , is independent of t1, t2,   . in particular, the modular invariance of the u-plane

integral in marino and moores setup at t1 = t and tn = 0 (n > 1) is retained even if the

higher coupling constants tn are turned on.

27

6.4 kdv again

what is new in the case of so(n) and sp(2n) is that the theta function in the tau

function is not a theta function on jac(c): this is a theta function on the prym variety

prym(c/c2) or, up to an isogeny, the jacobi variety jac(c ) of the quotient curve c .
as remarked in a previous section, the quotient curve c  is a hyperelliptic curve of the

type that arises in the kdv hierarchy. therefore the tau function , for the orthogonal

and symplectic gauge groups should be thought of as a tau function of the kdv hierarchy

rather than of the ane toda system.

this conclusion might cause confusion, but here is no contradiction. it is well known

that the ane toda system can be mapped to linear ows on the prym variety. apart
from the case of a(1)

n , however, this does not imply that its solutions and tau functions
can be written in terms of theta functions on the prym variety. actually, the ows are

rst linearized on the jacobi variety jac(c) of the ane toda spectral curve itself, and

then shown to be conned to a subspace that is parallel (but not identical) to the prym

variety embedded therein. all that one can expect is, accordingly, an expression in terms

of theta functions on jac(c). (surprisingly, however, very few is known about such an
explicit expression of solutions of the ane toda systems other than the a(1)

n .)
thus, our tau function , is something dierent from tau functions of the ane toda

systems, and our interpretation is that it is a special tau function of the kdv type.

6.5 whitham deformations and prepotential

let us now turn on the whitham deformations with slow variables tn. the seiberg-
witten prepotential f is also deformed and becomes a function f (~a, ~t ) of both ~a =
(a1,    , an ) and ~t = (t1, t2,   ). more precisely, f is dened by (3.17) for all cases
considered in the preceding sections. as one can immediately see by comparing these
equations with the denition of qmn, v (n)
fundamental quantities in our interpretation of the blowup formula can be written as

and pjk in the form of period integrals, these

j

second order derivatives of the prepotential:

vjn =

1
2i

2f

ajtn

,

qmn =

1
2i

2f

tmtn

, pjk =

2f

ajak

.

(6.17)

28

in particular, the potential v (n) of the observables in(b) turn out to be rst order deriva-

tives of f :

v (n) =

1
2i

f
tn

.

of course the aj-derivatives give the dual special coordinates aj =hbj

j =

ds:

(6.18)

(6.19)

thus the prepotential f = f (~a, ~t ) in the whitham deformations, too, is a kind of

generating function.

unlike the fast variables tn, the role of the slow variables tn is to deform the

period map ~u 7 ~a that connects the u-space and the a-space. presumably, this will be

a kind of deformations of background geometry in the sense of string theory, but the

precise meaning is still beyond our scope.

7 discussions

we have seen that the construction of whitham deformations by gorsky et al. [19] can

be extended to the seiberg-witten curves of all the classical gauge groups and some

other complex algebraic curves. although the construction is based on the somewhat

special form (2.1) of the curves, the only requirement seems to be that w (x) be a rational

function with a polynomial leading part. actually, we have obtained partial evidence that

an irrational superpotential might be allowed for at least in some special cases.

we have also extended our proposal in the previous paper [21] on the u-plane integral

of the su(n +1) topological gauge theory to all other classical gauge groups. a byproduct

of the construction of whitham deformations is to determine which ows of the underlying

integrable hierarchy (the toda hierarchy for the case of su(n +1) and the kdv hierarchy

for the other classical gauge groups) should be extracted; appropriate ows are those

generated by the meromorphic dierentials dn that arise in the construction of whitham

deformations. this enables us to express the relevant quantities qmn etc. as derivatives

of the prepotential f .

let us conclude this paper with discussions on possible extensions and implications of

these results.

29

non-hyperelliptic curves

the rst nontrivial step beyond rational superpotentials is irrational superpotentials of

the form

w (x) = r1(x) + r2(x)pr3(x),

(7.1)

where ri(x)s are polynomial or rational functions of x. this means that the curve c

is no longer hyperelliptic, but can be written in a special quartic polynomial in z with

rational coecients. well known examples of curves of this form are the seiberg-witten

curves of su(5) (a4) in the 10-dimensional anti-symmetric representation, e6 in the 27-

dimensional minimal representation, and g2 in the 7-dimensional minimal representation

[3, 36].

an obvious diculty is that w (x) itself is multi-valued, so that the fractional pow-

ers of w (x) requires a more careful treatment. this diculty, however, might be easily

overcome, because the same fractional powers are used in the work of eguchi and yang

[37] on the topological landau-ginzburg of the e6 singularity. this work also predicts

an interesting phenomena if the fractional power construction really works for the case

of e6. namely, as they observed in the topological landau-ginzburg theory, the admis-

sible meromorphic dierentials will be limited to those made from the fractional powers

w (x)n/12 with

n  1, 4, 5, 7, 8, 11 mod 12.

(7.2)

the numbers on the right hand sides are the exponents of e6.

for more general cases, however, an entirely new approach will be necessary. for

instance, wittens m5-brane construction [33] yields a non-hyperelliptic curve of the form

zk+1 + g1(x)zk +    + gk(x)z + 1 = 0

(7.3)

for the n = 2 susy yang-mills theory with the product gauge group su(n1)     

su(nk). the seiberg-witten dierential is given by

dssw = x

dz
z

.

(7.4)

a natural ansatz for the meromorphic dierentials dn of whitham deformations is to

seek for them in the form

dn = rn(x, z)

dz
z

, rn(x, z) = polynomial.

(7.5)

30

we do not know how to construct the polynomials rn(x, z). the problem becomes even

harder for the elliptic models of m5-branes.

relation to topological landau-ginzburg theories

the fractional power construction strongly suggests a direct link with topological landan-

ginzburg theories of a-d-e singularities coupled to gravity or, equivalently, d < 1 topolog-

ical strings [25, 26]. the relation between the seiberg-witten theory and d < 1 topological

strings has been studied from several aspects, such as the wdvv equations [38, 39], at

coordinates and gauss-manin systems [40, 41], etc. of course the very notion of prepoten-

tials itself is a bridge connecting the two worlds. in the d < 1 topological strings, the role

of the whitham equations is played by the dispersionless limit of integrable hierarchies

[42, 43, 44]. the fractional powers of the superpotential are fundamental building blocks

of the lax representation therein. nevertheless, the emergence of fractional powers in the

seiberg-witten theory is quite surprising.

an interesting outcome of our whitham deformations is that they have an exotic limit

as   0. in this limit, the seiberg-witten curve reduces to the rational curve

and the seiberg-witten dierential turns into the rational dierential

z = w (x),

dssw = x

w (x)dx

w (x)

.

(7.6)

(7.7)

as we shall show below, the whitham equations, too, have a well dened limit. furthre-

more, these dierential equations are similar, but not identical, to the following counter-

part in d < 1 topological strings [42, 43, 44]:



tn xm1

tmrm(x)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)w (x)=const.

= rn(x).

(7.8)

this dierence stems from the dierence of the two theories as landau-ginzburg

models. namely, whereas the whitham deformations at  = 0 is still related to a curve

dened by (7.6), the landau-ginzburg description of d < 1 topological strings is based

on a 0-dimensional manifold dened by the equation

w (x) = 0.

31

(7.9)

now, let us present the whitham equations at  = 0. for simplicity, we consider

the case of the su(n + 1) curve where w (x) = p (x); the other case can be treated

similarly. suppose, as usual, that the cycles aj are chosen to encircle the cuts between
two neighboring roots e
j of p (x)  42. as   0, the j-th cuts shrink to a point at the
ds then reduce to

j-th root ej of p (x) = qn +1

residue integrals, which can be readily calculated:

j=1 (x  ej). the period integrals aj = haj
aj = 2ixn1

(n = 1,    , n).

tnrn(ej)

(7.10)

this denes a map ~u 7 ~a from the u-space to the a-space with deformation parameters
tn, and this map is invertible if ~t is close to (1, 0, 0,   ). (note that the n + 1-th root
j=1 ej = 0.)
the inverse map determines, as in the case with  6= 0, a family of deformations of

en +1 of p (x) is not independent; the roots of p (x) obeys the constraint pn +1

the rational curve z = p (x). under these deformations, the following equations can be

eventually derived:



tn xm1
aj xm1



tmrm(x)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)p (x)=const.
tmrm(x)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)p (x)=const.

= rn(x) 

= (cid:18) 1

x  ej

n +1

rn(ek)p (x)
(x  ek)p (x)

xk=1
x  en +1(cid:19) p (x)

1



2ip (x)

(7.11)

we omit the proof of these equations, but the following comment would be enough for

understanding: these equations can be derived from the whitham equations (3.1) if dn

and dj are interpreted as follows:

dn = rn(x)

p (x)dx

p (x)



2irn(ej)dj,

n

xj=1

dj = (cid:18) 1

x  ej

x  en +1(cid:19) dx

.

(7.12)

in fact, they give a correct limit, as   0, of the dierentials on the  6= 0 curve.

a spectral curves of ane toda systems

here we present a list of the toda spectral curves

det(cid:16)l(z)  xi(cid:17) = 0

(a.1)

used in the text, along with the l-matrices l(z). the l-matrices are realized in a rep-
resentation of minimal dimensions. the l-matrices for a(1)

n are
borrowed from the work of adler and van moerbeke [45]. the other cases associated with
the twisted ane algebras a(2)

n are derived by the following folding procedure:

n and d(2)

n , b(1)

n , c (1)

n and d(1)

d(1)

2n 7 a(2)

2n 1, d(1)

n +2 7 d(2)

n +1, d(1)

2n +2 7 a(2)
2n .

(a.2)

the l-matrices in the following list have a symmetric form, i.e., l(z)t = l(z1),

as opposed to the l-matrices of martinec and warner [3]. accordingly, the actual form

of the spectral curves becomes

(z + z1) = w (x).

(a.3)

upon removing an overall constant or a non-dynamical factor (the factor x the case of
b(1)

n ). this curve, however, can be readily converted to the form of marninec and warner

by recalling z  z/.

some comments on the notations in the list are in order. aj and bj (j = 1,    , n) are

related to the canonical variables q and p (both in the cartan subalgebra of the classical

part of the ane algebra) of the ane toda system as follows:

aj = gej q,

bj = pj = hj  p.

(a.4)

here j (j = 1,    , n) are the simple roots and 0 is the ane root. (the null root is

ignored.) g is the coupling constant. (the ajs should not be confused with the special

coordinates ajs in the seiberg-witten theory.) ejk denotes the matrix with the only

non-vanishing elements equal to 1 at (j, k):

(ejk)mn = jmkn.
