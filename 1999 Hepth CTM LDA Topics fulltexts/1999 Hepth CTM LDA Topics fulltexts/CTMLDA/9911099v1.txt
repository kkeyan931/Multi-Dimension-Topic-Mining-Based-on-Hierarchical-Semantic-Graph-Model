field theory with instantons can be partially regularized by adding degrees of
freedom at some scale. these extra degrees of freedom lead to the appearence
of the new topological defects. these defects which we call freckles have some
characteristic size depending on the scale at which the extra degrees of freedom
revive.

the examples of two dimensional sigma model, four dimensional gauge theory
are studied. the compactication of the four dimensional supersymmetric gauge
theory down to two dimensions is also considered and the new phenomena are
found.

1 introduction

two dimensional sigma models and four dimensional gauge theories are sim-
ilar in many ways[23]. the interesting aspect of the both theories is the
presence of instantons, i.e. nite action solutions of the theory in the eu-
clidean space-time. also, in both theories the conformal invariance of the
instanton equations leads to the phenomenon of the instanton shrinking. in
this way the instanton moduli space extends into the ultraviolet regions of
the eld space where the degrees of freedom of more fundamental theory may
appear.

these degrees of freedom eectively compactify the instanton moduli
space, by adding the smooth eld congurations which look as singular point-

like objects from the point of view of low-energy observer. their contribu-
tion to the correlation functions is the phenomenon in the intersection theory
known as the contribution of the connected component (sect. 9.1, 10.4 in
[7]). its subtraction is an impact of the rg ow and is more or less contained
in the paradigm of integrating out of the fast degrees of freedom [21, 27].

in this short note we discuss briey the concrete examples of this phe-
nomena with implications to the studies of supersymmetric gauge theories in
four dimensions.

2 two dimensional instantons with freckles

non-linear sigma model. consider the n = 2 supersymmetric sigma model
(nlsm) with the target space v = a//g  the kahler quotient of the kahler
vector (ane) space (a, ) where g acts preserving . it has a moduli space
m of bps eld congurations - instantons, represented by the holomorphic
maps  of the worldsheet  into v . this space m splits as a disjoint union
of the spaces m labelled by  = [()]  h2(v, z). the complex (virtual)
dimension of m is given by:

dimm =z

c1(v ) + dimv (1  g)

(1)

with g being the genus of .
gauged linear sigma model. one can construct a gauged linear sigma model
(glsm), with chiral multiplets  +  + . . . taking values in a, and vector
multiplets a++. . .+ taking values in lieg. the action of glsm contains
the potential term v = h, i where  : a  lieg is a moment map and
h,i is a killing form (d-term).
at low energies the slowly varying eld congurations are localized near
the zeroes of  and therefore describe the maps to v = 1(0)/g.

however, one may be interested in bps eld congurations, and these

obey the following equations [27]:

fa = e2,

a = 0

(2)

with e being the gauge coupling.

topological classication. the moduli space fm of bps elds splits as a
disjoint union of the spaces fm corresponding to the topologically distinct

2

gauge eld congurations. the latter are labelled by   h2(, 1(g)) 
h1(g). in general there is no isomorphism between h1(g) and h2(v, z). as
a consequence, the bps congurations in the glsm and nlsm are labelled
by dierent groups. however, the canonical principal g-bundle over v gives
an element (characteristic class) of the group c  h2(v, h1(g)) and we get a
map2: h2(v, z)  h1(g):

 7  =z

c  h1(g)

(3)

holomorphic data. the second equation in (2) tells us that  is a holomorphic
section of a vector bundle e, whose holomorphic structure is specied by
a. the space of such sections is denoted by h0(e) - it is a vector (ane,
nite-dimensional) space for vector (ane, nite-dimensional) a. one has
riemann-roch formula:

dimh0(e)  dimh1(e) = d + rke(1  g)
2ir trfa,

where d = dege = 1
rk(e) = dima. if there is a bound tri 
r then only for d  2e2r that (2) have solutions (this is the sigma model
analogue of the donaldson jumps in four dimensional gauge theory).
the space a is acted upon the complexication gc of g. the potential
v viewed as a function on a induces a gradient ow with respect to the
kahler metric on a along which the value of the potential decreases. the
set as of points which ow to the zero set of v is distinguished for one has:
v = as/gc. the set of critical points of v may have several connected
components. for a coadjoint orbit  of g denote by c the set of critical
points x of v such that (x)  , and by s the points y which ow to c
under the paths of the steepest descend of v. the set of  for which c is
not empty is denoted by .
the spaces h = h0(e) and h = h1(e) form a pair of vector bun-
dles (actually their dierence is a better dened object as both may change
dimension) over the moduli space m of holomorphic bundles on . ac-
tually, not every holomorphic bundle is good. more precisely, the equation
fa = e2 picks out only stable pairs ( a, ) [5]. the quotient of the space
of stable pairs by the action of the complexied gauge group is the moduli

space of the bps congurations. it is simple to evaluate its dimension as-
suming that h = 0. since the complex dimension of m equals dimg(g 1)
and dimv = dima  dimg then:

dim fm = hi + dimv (1  g)

(4)

diers from the compactication by stable maps [10].

if  =r c for   h2(v, z) then hi =r c1(v ).
from now on put g = 0. in this case m is empty and the holomorphic
bundles have a stabilizer isomorphic to gc. the space h is acted upon by
the group gc. the subset of h which consists of the points whose gc orbit
intersects the space of solutions to the equation fa = e2 is denoted by
hs. the space of bps eld congurations is therefore fm = hs/gc. the
moduli space fm contains a subset m of gauge equivalence classes of sections
whose value at each point of  belongs to as. the s from the complement
fm\m violate this condition at some points z1, . . . , zk  , where they take
values in s1, . . . , sk.
remark. there is an interesting interplay between the g-equivariant coho-
mology of a, cohomology of v , the set , and the stratication of fm [11].
fm as (partial) compactication of m was studied in [6, 9, 18, 27, 28]. it
the points of fm are called freckled instantons, z1, . . . , zk are the freckles

of the types 1, . . . , k respectively. in physics literature they appeared as
vortices [1, 27].
the size of the freckles. as a smooth solution to (2) the freckles of the type
 have a size  
compactness of fm. if  is nite then the number of extra topological defects
from below. one expects fm to be compact in this case (of course assuming
the compactness of v ). however, if  is innite the space fm is non-compact.
correlation functions. in nlsm with the target space v an interesting set of
correlation functions is obtained as follows: for c  v and z   dene the
c (z)  m as follows: m(2)
subsets3 m(2)
c consists of such holomorphic
maps  :   v that () intersects c; m(0)
c (z) consists of holomorphic
maps  such that (z)  c. take the submanifolds c1, . . . , ck  v , let
1, . . . , k be the poincare duals (delta functions supported at) to c1, . . . , ck

in glsm the corresponding correlation functions count the intersection num-

c of the submanifolds m(0)

over the set of instantons with freckles [14].

so, are the freckles a nuisance or can they be helpful? one answer to
this question is suggested in [14] where it is shown that in principle one
could subtract the contribution of the freckles to get the genuine answers
from nlsm. or, in certain correlation functions the freckles are harmless.
for example, if c1(v ) > 0 then freckles do not contribute to the quantum
cohomology ring.

finally, as we shall see in the next section, the presence of freckles can

be necessary in order to build up a higher-dimensional theory.

3 four dimensional theory on a product of

two riemann surfaces

take a genus h riemann surface c, a compact semi-simple lie group h
and consider the moduli space of at h-connections on c. to make things
smooth we assume that h has a center z and consider the at connections in
h/z bundle e with non-trivial c1(e)  h2 (c, 1(h/z)) (t hooft magnetic
ux). this moduli space v is an innite-dimensional symplectic quotient of
the space a of all h-gauge elds (we omit the details concerning z here for
brevity, they can be found in [26]) by the action of the innite-dimensional
group g of h-gauge transformations. the space v has a canonical generator
of h2(v ) - the curvature of the determinant line bundle. we may take as
the kahler form on v the k-th multiple of this generator. the number k is
called the level.
four dimensional gauge theory emerges if we were to study the corresponding
glsm [3]. indeed the matter elds  are the gauge elds on c which also
vary along the worldsheet , the g gauge elds are simply the gauge elds

5

on  which also vary along c so altogether we get an h gauge eld on c.
the rest of the supermultiplets makes up a four dimensional partially twisted
n = 2 vector multiplet.
freckles. having learned the lessons of the previous section we immediately
raise the question of the interpretation of the freckles. the bps congura-
tions in the glsm turn out to be precisely four dimensional instantons on
  c. the two dimensional gauge coupling e2 is inversely proportional to
the area of c, e2  1
, while the four dimensional coupling is related to
kareac
the level k as g2  1
k . the labels  are interesting. they are nothing but the
dominant weights of h and correspond to the higher critical points of the
yang-mills functional on c. the size of the type  freckle is therefore:

compactness of the instanton moduli space. the fact that one can have
the freckles of the arbitrarily small size is related to the four dimensional
phenomenon of the instanton shrinking. one way to cure this problem is
to replace the instantons by the torsion free sheaves, as in [2, 8, 22, 12, 19],
or the non-commutative instantons [20].   c being kahler allows that.
there are new phenomena which one encounters after this compactication
is performed. to be specic we study u(2) case. the classical instanton
moduli space splits as a u(1) moduli space of at connections on   c and
an so(3) moduli space. moreover the parity of the c1 of the u(2) bundle
is correlated with w2 of the so(3) bundle, while u(1) bundle can have an
abritrary c1 allowed by the instanton equations.

what happens when we hit a 4d point-like instanton? if we are to treat
this 4d freckle in the holomorphic way we should replace a (stable) holomor-
phic rank two bundle e over the product of two curves   c by the torsion
free sheaf f which at some point ceases to be locally free. the space of
such sheaves (for xed underlying holomorphic bundle e  and xed position
z  p of the freckle) is isomorphic to a p1 whose role is the following. take
a holomorphic bundle e  of the instanton charge less then that of f by one.
fix a complex line l in the ber e 
zp over a point z  p. the space of such
lines is a copy of p1 which we mentioned. then the sheaf fl is a sheaf of
sections of e  whose value at the point z  p belongs to l. one can show
that the instanton charge of f is a sum: ch2(f ) = ch2(e )  1, (see [14] for
details on the sheaves and freckles).

6

now let us look at what happens from the point of view of the two
dimensional sigma model. we should restrict our sheaf onto each ber wc,
w  . if the restriction fw is stable then the point w is mapped to a point
in the moduli space of stable rank two bundles on c, i.e. for such a point w
we are within the nlsm regime. if for some point w 6= z we get an unstable
bundle fw then we get a two-dimensional freckle  the freckle of the glsm.
the type  of freckle is presicely the type of unstable bundle we got.
finally, if we hit the point w = z then the sheaf we get on z c is a sheaf
of sections of a vector bundle e with smaller c1(e) then the rst chern class
of the bundles over nearby bers!

so the message here is that the four dimensional compactication adds
in addition to the freckles which have to do with the unstable bundles of the
same topology as the generic stable ones the bundles of dierent topology as
well. we hope to return to more detailed investigation of this structure in
future.
quantum cohomology ring. suppose that   s2 and take the limit where
areac  areas2. we said above the quantum cohomology ring is not af-
fected by freckles, so we may compute the quantum cohomology of v using
four dimensional gauge theory. the manifold  s2 has b+
2 = 1 which is the
situation where the donaldson invariants get a contribution of the u-plane
integral [16] in addition to a seiberg-witten contribution. it can be com-
puted using the contact terms from [13] via the jumping techniques [16, 17].
the result is interesting to compare with the results of the computations in
another chamber where c is large and s2 is small in which case one nds [13]
a landau-ginzburg type topological sigma model with the target space being
a certain cover of the seiberg-witten u-plane. in particular the topological
ring is innite-dimensional in this case. to the contrary, the ring collapses
once one passes through all the jumping walls. we present the answer for
the so(3) case with (w2, [c]) 6= 0. the classical cohomology ring of v is
generated by the observables in the two dimensional yang-mills theory [26]:

the fact that the transcedental functions present in the similar expression
valid in the other chamber cancel leading to the nite dimensional quantum
cohomology ring is a serious check of the assertions above. it conrms the
conjecture of [4].
rened donaldson-witten theory?. in [13] it was argued that the four di-
mensional gauge theory has much more interesting observables then those
studied in the donaldson theory. in fact, to each invariant polynomial i()
on the lie algebra of the gauge group one associates a descend sequence
of observables, the highest term being the 4-observable which may be used
for deforming the action. on the other hand, using the fact that the mod-
uli space of at connections is a fano variety one can compute its genus
zero gromov-witten invariants simply from the wdvv equations using the
reconstruction theory of [10]. but, as we have argued above, the four dimen-
sional instantons contain in addition to the two dimensional instantons also
two dimensional freckles of various types. so if we were to compactify the
four dimensional instanton moduli space we would certainly get the space
which looks very much dierent from the moduli space of stable maps into v
above. hence the computation of gromov-witten invariants, although pro-
duces the interesting function of the right number of variables (if the curves
c of all genera are considered) still misses the mark.
higher dimensions. in principle we can construct the six-dimensional theory
[3] at least at the level of its bps eld congurations by taking a two dimen-
sional riemann surface and studying its holomorphic maps into a moduli
space of instantons on a kahler fourfold x. then, upon adding the freck-
les which are connections obeying f 2,0 = 0 and at the same time reducible

4the similar results were obtained independently in [15], although in a less concise form

8

stationary points of the yang-mill functional we get a six dimensional bps
gauge eld. we believe these gauge elds are relevant in the study of d1-d5
systems.
