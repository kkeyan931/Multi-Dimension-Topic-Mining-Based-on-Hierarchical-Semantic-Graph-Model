(2.17) (2.18) (2.19) (2.20) decomposing (2.19) spacetime internal components gives, (cid:26) + ebg bc = 0. e bgab(a)b(cid:27) c = 0. 3 2 last two terms (2.20) look like mass terms perspective three- dimensional observer. second term conventional leads usual harmonicity condition internal components c. however, third term new consequence warp factor. presence non-trivial background g-ux, equation (2.17) uctuation c becomes: set metric uctuations zero (2.21). decompose c product c = g c. (2.21) spacetime internal elds, c = (x)c(3)(y) + a(x)c(2)(y), (2.22) consider spacetime multiplets vector scalar elds, c(n) n-form eight manifold. dispense immediately counting vector elds a(x) since zero-mode c(2) pairs kahler class deformation give vector multiplet. need count number massless modes h 1,1(m) count number vector multiplets. nal source moduli analogues wilson lines c-eld. absence g-ux, element h 2,1(m) gives rise zero-mode c(3) therefore chiral multiplet.1 presence g-ux, conditions c(3) modied. 1 note h 3,0(m) empty simply connected calabi-yau. 7 expand left hand side (2.21) follows, c = c(3) + c(3) + d(e3/2 dc(3)), (2.23) hodge star appearing right hand side respect unwarped spacetime internal metrics. combining (2.23) right hand side (2.21) gives following set equations: g dc(3) = 0, g c(3) = 0, c(3) = 0, c(3) = d(cid:16)e3/2{dc(3) dc(3)}(cid:17) . satisfy third equation (2.24), x gauge demanding that, c = 0. (2.24) (2.25) choice diers usual gauge xing condition (2.18) exact form. consequence (2.25), c(3) = 0. rst equation (2.24) consequence equation two requires that, g c(3) = 0. (2.26) condition analogue primitivity condition (2.10) metric. right hand side nal equation (2.24) must vanish since term gives mass spacetime eld . requiring perturbation dc(3) take us supersymmetric vacuum implies dc(3) must self-dual, turn implies c(3) harmonic. therefore element h 2,1(m) satises (2.26) gives rise chiral multiplet. 2.4. lifting g-ux f theory eight manifold elliptically-bered base b, shrinking volume ber, lift theory compactication four-dimensional type iib compactication ir4 b. since power warp factor dierent spacetime internal metric (2.16), might worry resulting four-dimensional metric breaks lorentz invariance. 8 let us rst show case. theory 2 area maps type iib circle s1 radius proportional 1/a. locally, warp factor rescales metric sending: however, corresponds rescaling iib circle metric e/2a. 1 a2 e 1 a2 , precisely power needed obtain lorentz invariant four-dimensional metric. g-ux lift type iib? let us start ga component. component form dc, c-eld lifts component four-form d+ type iib: c d+ .

(3.9) note choice g-ux preserve full n=4 supersymmetry. varying complex structure k3i rotates i, ji other. resulting g 13 longer supersymmetric. therefore, n=2 supersymmetry survives. contruct another example k3 k3 compactication g-ux following section. leaving case, let us see special choices g-ux appear e8 e8 heterotic dual. illustration, let us take form (3.1) g-ux. theory k31 k32 dual realization terms heterotic string 3 k32. away points enhanced symmetry, heterotic string 3 22 abelian gauge-elds. mentioned before, gauge-elds arise theory reducing c-eld 22 elements h 2(k3, zz). express g reduced k31 terms eld strength f abelian gauge-eld, g 2 = f 1. take f = 2, corresponds heterotic side taking abelian connection instanton number k32. membranes used cancel anomaly correspond heterotic ve-branes wrapping 3. 16 gauge-elds coming cartan e8 e8, supersymmetry requires that, gabfab = 0, f (1, 1) form. clearly constraints satised g-ux form (3.1). 3.2. orbifold examples constant g-ux next class examples construct orbifold singularities. examples constant g-uxes. cases f theory lifts, corresponding h h -uxes also constant. let (z1, z2, z3, z4) coordinatize 8. since consider zz2 quotients, restrict 8 2 2 2 2 2 rectangular. choose 2 periods, zj x dzi = j zj dzi = j, x x one-cycles. since spaces zz2 quotients 8, metric away singular- ities kahler form is, j =xi dzi dzi. 14 (3.10) let us take g form, g 2 =a dz1dz2dz3dz4 + dz1dz2dz3dz4 + b dz1dz2dz3dz4+ b dz1dz2dz3dz4 + c dz1dz2dz3dz4 + c dz1dz2dz3dz4. (3.11) choice (2, 2) form certainly satises j g = 0. construction, g real. also require g/2 (half)-integer quantized. requiring g/2 integral four-cycles 8 gives conditions: 2 {rea reb rec} zz, 2 {ima imb imc} zz.
