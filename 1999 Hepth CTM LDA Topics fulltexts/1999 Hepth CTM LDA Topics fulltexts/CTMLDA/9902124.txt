(3) show time evolution contain purely geometric part, i.e. berry phase. straightforward calculation separate geometric dynamical phases following standard procedure : e = +z 0 he(t)| |e(t)i dt = 21 2 1 + 2 2 1 (1 cos2 + 2 sin2 ) = 2 sin2 . (4) thus see indeed non-zero geometrical phase , related mixing angle , independent neutrino energies 1, 2 masses m1, m2. similar fashion, obtain berry phase muon neutrino state: = +z 0 h(t)| |(t)i dt = 2 cos2 . note e + = 2. thus rewrite (3) |e(t )i = ei2 sin2 eieet |e(0)i , used notation 2 (5) (6) he(t)| |e(t)i = he(t)| h |e(t)i = 1 cos2 + 2 sin2 ee . also use h(t)| |(t)i = h(t)| h |(t)i = 1 sin2 + 2 cos2 , h(t)| |e(t)i = h(t)| h |e(t)i = 1 2 (2 1) sin 2 e , (7) (8) (9) e = e. order better understand meaning (4)-(6), observe that, well known, |ei eigenstate hamiltonian, he(0)|e(t)i = ei1t cos2 + ei2t sin2 . (10) thus, eect time evolution, state |ei rotates shown eq.(10). however, = , he(0)|e(t )i = ei = eieeieet , (11) i.e. |e(t )i diers |e(0)i phase , part geometric tilt (the berry phase) part dynamical origin. general, = + , he(0)|e(t)i = ei he(0)|e( )i also notice h(t)|e(t)i = 0 t. however, = ei2 sin2 eieet (cid:0)ei1 cos2 + ei2 sin2 (cid:1) . (12) h(0)|e(t)i = 1 2 eiei1 sin 2(cid:0)ei(21) 1(cid:1) , f = + , (13) zero = . eq.(13) expresses fact |e(t)i oscillates, getting component muon avor, besides getting berry phase. = , neutrino states dierent avor orthogonal states. generalization ncycles also interesting. eq.(4) (and (5)) rewritten ncycle case (n) e = z nt 0 he(t)| 1 |e(t)i dt = 2 n sin2 , eq.(12) becomes he(0)|e(t)i = ein he(0)|e( )i , f = nt + . (14) (15) similarly eq.(13) gets phase ein instead ei. eq.(14) shows berry phase acts counter neutrino oscillations, adding 2 sin2 phase (electron) neutrino state complete oscillation. eq.(14) interesting especially rewritten (n) e = z nt 0 he(t)| u 1(t) it(cid:16)u(t) |e(t)i(cid:17) dt = z nt 0 h e(t)| it| e(t)i dt = 2 n sin2 , (16) 3 u(t) = eif (t), f (t) = f (0) 1t, | e(t)i u(t)|e(t)i = eif (0)(cid:0)cos |1i + ei(21)t sin |2i (cid:1) . eq.(16) actually provides alternative way dening berry phase , makes use state | e(t)i given eq.(17). contrast state |e(t)i, | e(t)i tilted time evolution: (17) h e(0)| e(t)i = h e(0)| e( )i , f = nt + , (18) compared eq.(15). eq.(17) also see time evolution aects |2i component state | e(t)i, it| e(t)i = (2 1)eif (0)ei(21)t sin |2i = (h 1)eif (0) (cid:0)cos |1i + ei(21)t sin |2i (cid:1) = (h 1)| e(t)i . (19) thus understand eq.(16) directly gives us geometric phase quantity ih e(t)| e(t)i dt overlap | e(t)i parallel transported + dt. another geometric invariant considered = z nt 0 e dt = n sin 2 . (20) since e energy shift level ee caused avor interaction term hamiltonian , easily seen 2 e = e2 he(t)|h 2|e(t)i he(t)|h|e(t)i2 , (21) recognize eq.(20) gives geometric invariant discussed ref. , dened quite generally = r e(t)dt. advantage well dened also systems non-cyclic evolution. consider case three avor mixing. consider electron neutrino state time {$9803157$}: |e(t)i = ei1t(cid:0)cos 12 cos 13 |1i + ei(21)t sin 12 cos 13 |2i + ei(31)tei sin 13 |3i (cid:1) , (22) analogous cp violating phase ckm matrix. let us consider particular case two frequency dierences proportional: 3 1 = q(2 1), q rational number. case state (22) periodic period = 2 use previous denition berry phase: 21 = +z 0 he(t)| h |e(t)i dt = 2(cid:0)sin2 12 cos2 13 + q sin2 13(cid:1) , (23) course reduces result (4) 13 = 0. eq.(23), however, shows completely free dynamical parameters since appearance parameter q. although this, purely geometric, nevertheless interesting = 1, 2, 3 , ratio depend specic frequencies i, dierences only. means (geometric) classes labelled q. plan calculate geometric invariant three avor neutrino state: requires consideration projective hilbert space line ref. . 4 iii. final remarks conclusions geometric phase generally associated parametric dependence time evolution generator. cases, theory exhibits gauge-like structure may become manifest characterizing physical system, e.g. bohm-aharonov eect . natural ask question possible gauge structure case con- sidered paper. let us see how, indeed, covariant derivative may introduced. let us consider evolution mass eigenstates it|i(t)i = h |i(t)i , (24) = 1, 2. equations invariant following (local time) gauge transformation |i(t)i | i(t)i u(t)|i(t)i = eif (t)|i(t)i , provided  = itu(t), i.e. u 1(t)hu(t) = h + u 1(t)itu(t) = h + tf (t) . suggests that, rewriting (24) (it h) |i(t)i = 0 , consider dt + ih covariant derivative: dt = u(t)dtu 1(t) . indeed id t| i(t)i = id tu(t)|i(t)i = iu(t)dt|i(t)i = 0 , (25) (26) (27) (28) (29) fact expresses invariance eq.(24) (25). thus see time dependent canonical transformation hamiltonian eq.(26) eq.(25) play role local (in time) gauge transformation. note state |e(t)i eq.(17) superposition states |i(t)i. role diabatic force arising term u 1(t)itu(t) considered detail elsewhere . summarizing, shown berry phase built neutrino oscilla- tions, explicitly computed cyclic two-avour case particular case three avor mixing. result also applies (similar) cases particle oscillations. noticed measurement berry phase would give direct measurement mixing angle independently values masses. analysis terms tilting state time evolution, parallel trans- port covariant derivative also suggests eld mixing may seen result curvature state space. berry phase appears manifestation curvature. finally, remark recognition geometric phase associated mixed states also suggests us similar geometric phase also occurs entangled quantum states reveal relevant completely dierent contexts particle oscillations, namely quantum computation . 5 iv. acknowledgements thank m.nowak d.brody fruitful discussions. m.b. g.v. acknowledge infn, infm, murst esf support. 6
