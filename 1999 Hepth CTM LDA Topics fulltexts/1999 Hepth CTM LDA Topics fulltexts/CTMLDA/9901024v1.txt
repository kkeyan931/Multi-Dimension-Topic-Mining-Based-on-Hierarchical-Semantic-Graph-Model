abstract

a review is made on some recent studies which support the point of view that the
relativistic eld theory quantized on the light-front (lf), as proposed by dirac, seems
to be more transparent compared to the conventional equal-time quantized one. some
ideas following from these studies may be of some relevance in the context of the
quantization of gravitation theory.

it is argued on general grounds that the lf quantization is equally appropriate as the
conventional equal-time one and that the two should lead, assuming the microcausality
principle, to the same physical content. this is shown to be true by considering several
model eld theories. the description on the lf of the spontaneous symmetry breaking
(ssb), (tree level) higgs mechanism, of the condensate or -vacua in the schwinger
model (sm), of the absence of such vacua in the chiral sm (csm), and of the brs-
bft quantization of the front form csm are among the topics discussed.

the lf phase space is strongly constrained and is dierent from the one in the
conventional theory. the removal of the constraints by following the dirac procedure
results in a substantially reduced number of independent operators. the discussion of
the physical hilbert space and the vacuum becomes more tractable.

some comments on the irrelevance, in the quantized eld theory, of the fact that
the hyperplanes x = 0 constitute characteristic surfaces of the hyperbolic partial
dierential equation are also made. the lf theory quantized on, say, the x+ = const.
hyperplanes seems to contain in it the information on the equal-x commutators as
well.

a theoretical rearmation of the universally accepted notion that the experimental
data is to be confronted with the predictions of a classical theory model only after it
has been upgraded through its quantization seems to emerge. the lf quantization
promises to be a powerful tool, complementary to the functional integral method, for
handling the nonperturbative calculations.

1- introduction

dirac [1], in his paper, in 1949, discussed the unication, in a relativistic theory,
of the principles of the quantization and the special relativity theory. the light-front
(lf) quantization which studies the relativistic quantum dynamics of physical system

proposed there. the instant form or the conventional equal-time theory on the contrary
uses the x0 = const. hyperplanes. the lf coordinates x : (x+, x, x), where x =

on the hyperplanes : x0 + x3  2x+ = const., called the front form theory, was also
(x0x3)/2 = x and x = (x1, x2), are convenient to use in the front form theory.
they are not related by a lorentz transformation to the coordinates (x0  t, x1, x2, x3)
usually employed in the instant form theory and as such the descriptions of the same
physical content of a dynamical theory on the lf may come out to be dierent from
that given in the conventional treatment. the lf quantized eld theory may hence
be of some relevance in the understanding of the unication of the principles of the
quantization with that of the general covariance3.

we will make the convention to regard4 x+   as the lf-time coordinate while
x  x as the longitudinal spatial coordinate. the temporal evolution in x0 or x+ of
the system is generated by hamiltonians which are dierent in the two forms of the
theory. the lf components, with  = +,, 1, 2, of any tensor are dened likewise.
consider [2] the invariant distance between two spacetime points : (x  y)2 =
(x0 y0)2 (~x ~y)2 = 2(x+ y+)(x y) (x y)2. on an equal x0 = y0 = const.
hyperplane the points have spacelike separation except for if they are coincident when
it becomes lightlike one. on the lf with x+ = y+ = const. the distance becomes
independent of (x  y) and the seperation is again spacelike; it becomes lightlike
one when x = y but with the dierence that now the points need not necessarily
be coincident along the longitudinal direction. the lf eld theory hence need not
necessarily be local in x, even if the corresponding instant form theory is formulated
as a local one. for example, the commutator [a(x+, x, x), b(0, 0, 0)]x+=0 of two
scalar observables would vanish on the grounds of microcausality principle if x 6= 0
when x2|x+=0 is spacelike. its value would hence be proportional to 2(x) and a nite
number of its derivatives, implying locality only in x but not necessarily so in x.
similar arguments in the instant form theory lead to the locality in all the three spatial
coordinates. in view of the microcausality both of the commutators [a(x), b(0)]x+=0
and [a(x), b(0)]x0=0 are nonvanishing only on the light-cone.

we remark that in the lf quantization we time order with respect to  rather
than t. the microcausality principle, however, ensures that the retarded commutators
[a(x), b(0)](x0) and [a(x), b(0)](x+), which appear [3] in the s-matrix elements of
relativistic eld theory, do not lead to disagreements in the two formulations. in the
regions x0 > 0, x+ < 0 and x0 < 0, x+ > 0, where the commutators seem dierent the

schwarzshild singularity.

x2 is spacelike and both of them vanish. hence, admitting the microcausality principle
to hold, the lf hyperplane seems equally appropriate as the conventional one of the
instant form theory for the canonical quantization.

the structure of the lf phase space, however, is dierent from that of the one in the
conventional theory. consequently, we may require on the lf a dierent description of
to the same physical content as found in the conventional treatment. for example, the
ssb needs a dierent description [2] or mechanism on the lf when compared with the
conventional one. the broken continuous symmetry is now inferred from the study of
the residual unbroken symmetry of the lf hamiltonian operator while the symmetry of
the lf vacuum remains intact. the expression which counts the number of goldstone
bosons present in the theory, a physical content, comes out to be the same as that
found in the equal-time quantized theory. a new proof of the colemans theorem [4]
on the absence of the goldstone bosons in two dimensional theory also emerges [2]
easily on the lf. the lf vacuum is generally found to be simpler [5, 6] and in many
cases the interacting theory vacuum is seen to coincide5.

an important advantge pointed out by dirac of front form theory is that here
seven out of the ten poincare generators are kinematical, e.g., they leave the plane
x+ = 0 invariant [1]. they are p +, p 1, p 2, m 12 = j3, m + = m 03 = k3, m 1+ =
(k1 + j2)/2 and m +2 = (k2j1)/2. in the conventional theory only six such ones,
viz., ~p and m ij = m ij, leave the hyperplane x0 = 0 invariant. in fact, in the standard
notation ki = m 0i, ji = (1/2)ijkm kl, i, j, k = 1, 2, 3 and the generator k3 is
dynamical one in the instant form theory. it is in contrast kinematical in the front form
theory where it generates the scale transformations of the lf components of x, p  and
m  , with ,  = +,, 1, 2. it is also worth remarking that the + component of the
pauli-lubanski pseudo-vector w  is special in that it contains only the lf kinematical
generators. this suggests us to dene the lf spin operator by j3 = w +/p +. the
other two components of ~j are shown to be ja = (j3p a + w a)/qp p, a = 1, 2,

which, however, do carry6 in them also the lf dynamical generators p , m 1, m 2.

another distinguishing feature of the front form theory is that it gives rise gen-

5in fact, in many cases the interacting theory vacuum may coincide with the perturbation theory
one. this results from the fact that momentum four-vector is now given by (k, k+, k) where

k = (k0k3)/2. here k is the lf energy while k and k+ indicate the transverse and the
longitudinal components of the momentum respectively. for a free massive particle on the mass
shell we have 2kk+ = (k2
+ m2) > 0 so that k are both positive denite when k0 > 0. the
conservation of the total longitudinal momentum does not permit the excitation of massive quanta
by the lf vacuum. we require k+  0 for each particle (and antiparticle) entering the ground state,
which has vanishing total momentum. such congurations constitute a point with zero measure in the
lf phase space and may [5] not be of relevance in many cases. however, it should be noted that when
dealing with the momentum space integrals, say, the loop integrals, a signicant contribution may
arise precisely from such a corresponding conguration in the integrand; the reason being that we have
to deal with the products of several distributions. on the other hand, (k1, k2, k3) may take positive
or negative values and we may construct in the conventional theory eigenstates of zero momentum
with an arbitrary number of particles (and antiparticles) which may mix with the vacuum state, with

no particles, to form the ground state.

erally to a (strongly) constrained dynamical system [7] which leads to an appreciable
reduction in the number of independent operators on the phase space. the vacuum
structure, for example, then becomes more tractable and the computation of physical
quantities simpler. this is veried in the recent study of the lf quantized sm [8] and
the chiral sm (csm) discussed below where we are led directly to the physical hilbert
space, once the constraints are taken into account by following the dirac procedure [7].
we recall that the lf eld theory was rediscovered in 1966 by weinberg [9] in
his feynman rules adapted for innite momentum frame.
it was demonstrated [10]
latter that these rules, in fact, correspond to the front form quantized theory. it was
also employed successfully in the nonabelian bosonization of the eld theory of n
free majorana fermions, where the corresponding lf current algebra was compared
[11] with the one in the bosonized theory described by the wznw action at the
critical point. the interest in lf quantization has been revived [5, 6] also due to
the diculties encountered in the computation, in the conventional framework, of the
nonperturbative eects in the context of qcd and the problem of the relativistic bound
states of light fermions [6, 5] in the presence of the complicated vacuum. studies
show that the application of light-front tamm-danco method may be feasible here.
the technique of the regularization on the lattice has been quite successful for some
problems but it cannot handle, for example, the light ( chiral) fermions and has not
been able yet to demonstrate, for example, the connenment of quarks. the problem
of reconciling the standard constituent quark model and the qcd to describe the
hadrons is also not satisfactorily resolved. in the former we employ few valence quarks
while in the latter the qcd vacuum state itself contains, in the conventional theory,
an innite sea of constituent quarks and gluons ( partons) with the density of low
momentum constituents getting very large in view of the infrared slavery. the front
form dynamics may serve as a complementary tool to study such probelms since we
have a simple vacuum here while the complexity of the problem is now transferred to the
lf hamiltonian. in the case of the scalar eld theory, for example, the corresponding
lf hamiltonian is, in fact, found [2] to be nonlocal due to the appearence of constraint
equations on the lf phase space.

we discuss here only some of the interesting conclusions reached from the detailed
study of some model relativistic theories on the lf and where the standard dirac
procedure for constrained dynamical systems is followed in order to build the self-
consistent hamiltonian formulation. among some of the results obtained we nd that

 the lf hyperplane is equally appropriate as the conventional equal-time one for

the eld theory quantization.

 the hyperplanes x = 0 dene the characteristic surfaces of a hyperbolic partial
dierential equation. from the mathematical theory of classical partial dieren-
tial equations [12] it is known that the cauchy initial value problem would require
us to specify the data on both the hyperplanes. from our studies we conclude
that it is sucient in the front form theory to choose, as proposed by dirac [1],
one of the two lf hyperplanes for canonically quantizing the theory.

- in the quantized theory the equal- commutators of the eld operators, at a

4

xed initial lf-time, form now a part of the initial data instead and we deal with
operator dierential equations.

- the studies show that the information on the commutators on the other char-
acteristic hyperplane are already contained [8] in the quantized theory and need
not thus be specied separately.

 the inherent symmetry with regard to equal-x commtators along with the re-
duced number of independent eld operators which survive after the constraints
are taken care of seem to be responsible for the very transparent discussion on
the lf.

 the physical content following from the front form theory is the same, even
though arrived at through dierent description on the lf, when compared with
the one in the instant form case.

 in the conventional treatment we sometimes are required to introduce external
constraints in the theory based on physical considerations, say, when describing
the spontaneous symmetry breaking. many of the analogous constraints may be
shown to be already icorporated in the quantized theory considered on the lf.

 a theoretical demonstration of the well accepted notion that a classical model
eld theory must be upgraded rst through its quantization before we confront
it with the experimental data, seems to emerge.

 the recently proposed brs-bft [13] quantization procedure is extended straight-
forwardly on the lf as well as is illustrated below in the context of csm (ap-
pendix d).

 topological considerations often employed in the context of the functional integral
techniques, where the euclidean theory action is ususally employed, also seem to
have their counterpart, though now interpreted dierently. this is suggested, for
example, from the studies of the lf quantized sm and csm.

for illustration purposes we discuss in the following sections the description on the
lf of the spontaneous symmetry breaking (ssb) and of the structure of the vacuum
state in the csm while some other topics related to the front form theory are collected
in the appendices.

2- spontaneous symmetry breaking mechanism on the lf

on the canonical quantization of the instant form scalar eld lagrangian theory
we obtain as well known the hamiltonian and the commutation relations among the
eld operators. the description of, say, the tree level ssb emerges when we require
also (e.g., introduce external constraints ), based on physical considerations, that the
classical   corresponds to the minimum of the hamiltonian functional. the front
form of the same theory describes [2] a constrained dynamical system and the canonical
hamiltonian framework, which may be quantized by the correspondence principle,

5

is shown to contain in it a new ingredient in the form of the constraint equations,
in addition to the hamiltonian and commmutators among the eld operators. the
constraint equations may also be derived from the lagrange equations of motion 7.
the new ingredient permits us to describe [2] ssb on the lf without requiring us
to deal with the dicult task of introducing constraints on the lf based on physical
considerations. some of them may be shown to be already incorporated [2] in the
formulation itself due to the requirement of the selfconsistency [7].

the existence of the continuum limit of the discretized light cone quantized
(dlcq) [14] theory, the nonlocal nature of the lf hamiltonian, and the description
of the ssb on the lf were claried [2, 15] only recently.

consider rst the two dimensional case of single real scalar theory with the la-

grangian l = [   v ()]. here   x+ = (x0 + x1)/2, x  x = (x0  x1)/2,
  = , x = , and d2x = d dx. it is the simplest example of a constrained eld
 = (1/2)v ()/, shows that  = const. is a possible
theory. the eq. of motion,
solution. we propose to make the following separation8 (, x) = ( ) + (, x) where
the ( ) is the dynamical variable representing the bosonic condensate and (, x)
describes (quantum) uctuations above it. we set r dx(, x) = 0 so that the uctu-

ation eld carries no zero momentum mode in it. subsequently, we apply the standard
dirac procedure in order to construct a selfconsistent hamiltonian formulation which
may be quantized canonically.

7that the constraint equations can be derived simply by integrating the lagrange equations of
motion over the longitudinal spatial coordinate x was noted also in: p.p. srivastava, on spontaneous
symmetry breaking mechanism on the light-front quantized eld theory, ohio-state preprint 91-0481,
slac database ppf-9148 (see also 92-0012, ppf-9202), november 91; available as scanned copies. in
fact, dirac in his paper does consider some examples where the constraints on the form of the potential
are required if we would like to unify in the dynamical theory the principles of the quantization and
the relativistic invariance.
it is interesting to note that soon after in 1950-52 he formulated also
the systematic method (dirac procedure) for constructing hamiltonian formulation for a constrained

dynamical system.

eliminating  would lead to a nonlinear and nonlocal hamiltonian in the front form
theory even when the scalar theory is written above a local one in the conventional
instant form formulation.

at the tree or classical level  are bounded ordinary functions in x and only the
rst term survives in the constraint equation leading to v () = 0, which is the same
as found in the conventional theory. there it is essentially added to the theory, on
the physical considerations which require the energy functional to attain is minimum
(extremam) value. the stability property, say, of a particular constant solution may be
inferred as usual from the classical partial dierential equation of motion. for example,
 = 0 is shown to be an unstable solution for the potential v considered above while
the other two solutions with  6= 0 give rise to the stable phases9.
the construction of the hamiltonian formulation using the dirac method [7] is
a straightforward exercise. we may use [2] the continuum formulation directly or
proceed from the dlcq [14], and take its innitie volume limit [15] to obtain the
same results. the canonical quantization is performed via the correspondence which
relates the nal dirac brackets with the commutators (or anticommutators). we note
that the dirac procedure when applied to the scalar theory written in the continuum
shows that the variable  is a c-number or a background eld; in the theory described
in nite volume, however, its commutator with  is nonvanishing [2] and as such it
is a q-number operator. we stress that in our discussion the condensate variable is
introduced as a dynamical variable and we let the dirac procedure decide if it comes
out as a c- or q-number.
in the sm it comes out to be an operator rather than a
background eld.

in the quantized theory the constraint equation above shows that the value of 
would be altered from its tree level value due to the quantum corrections arising from
the other terms. it is, in fact, straightforward to renormalize the theory, say, up to
one-loop order by employing the dyson-wick expansion. we do not need to solve the
constraint rst which would give rise to a very complicated lf hamiltonian.
it is
more convenient to derive [2] the renormalized constraint eqn. which together with the
expression of mass renormalization condition give us two eqns. which may be used to
study [2] the phase transition as conjectured by simon and griths [16].

in view of the lf commutator above the scalar eld has the lf momentum space ex-

pansion : (x,  ) = (1/2)r dk (k) [a(k,  ) eikx+a(k,  )eikx]/(2k), were a(k,  )
and a(k,  ) satisfy the canonical equal- commutation relations, [a(k,  ), a(k,  )] =
(k  k) etc.. the vacuum state is dened by a(k,  )|vaci = 0 , k > 0 and the tree
level description of the ssb is given as follows. the values of  = h||ivac obtained
from v () = 0 characterize the dierent vacua in the theory. distinct fock spaces
corresponding to dierent values of  are built as usual by applying the creation op-

erators on the corresponding vacuum state. the  = 0 corresponds to a symmetric
phase since the hamiltonian operator is then symmetric under   . for  6= 0
this symmetry is violated and the system is in a broken or asymmetric phase.
the extension to 3+1 dimensions and to the global continuous symmetry is straight-
forward10. consider real scalar elds a(a = 1, 2, ..n) which form an isovector of global
internal symmetry group o(n). we now write11 a(x, x,  ) = a + a(x, x,  ) and
the lagrangian density is l = [ aa(1/2)(ia)(ia)v ()], where i = 1, 2 indicate
the transverse space directions. the taylor series expansion of the constraint equations

tors thus annihilate the lf vacuum and the ssb is now seen in the broken symmetry
of the quantized theory hamiltonian. the criteria for the counting of the number of
goldstone bosons on the lf is found to be the same as in the conventional theory. in
contrast, the rst term on the right hand side of q(x0) does annihilate the conven-
tional theory vacuum but the second term gives now non-vanishing contributions for
some of the (broken) generators. the symmetry of the conventional theory vacuum
is thereby broken while the quantum hamiltonian remains invariant. the physical
content of ssb in the instant form and the front form, however, is the same though
achieved by dierent descriptions. alternative proof on the lf, in two dimensions, can
be given of the colemans theorem related to the absence of goldstone bosons; we are
unable [2] to implement the second class constraints over the phase space. we remark
that the simplicity of the lf vacuum is in a sense compensated by the involved nonlo-
cal hamiltonian. the latter, however, may be treatable using advance computational
techniques. also in connection with renormalization it may not be necessary12 rst to
solve all the constraint equations.

to summarize, the simple procedure of separating rst the condensate variable 
in the scalar eld before applying the dirac procedure is found to be successful also
in describing [2] the phase transition in two dimensional scalar theory, the ssb of
continuous symmetry, a new proof of the colemans theorem and the tree level higgs
mechanism. it is again found successful in showing [8] the emergence on the lf of the
-vacua along with their continuum normalization in the bosonized sm while explaining
at the same time their absence in the csm. the condensate variable, we remind, is
introduced as a dynamical variable and we let the dirac procedure decide if it comes

out to be a c-number (background eld) or a q-number operator in the quantized eld
theory. it is shown [2] to be c-number in the scalar theory studied in the continuum
while it is an operator in the sm whose eigenvalues characterize the -vacua. in the
next sec. we discuss in some detail the vacuum structure in the csm which illustrates
the remarkable transparency attained in the discussion on the lf.

it is worth remarking that the lf formulation is inherently symmetrical with respect
to x+ and x and it is a matter of convention that we take the plus component as
the lf time while the other as a spatial coordinate. the theory quantized at x+ =
const. hyperplanes seems already to incorporate in it the information on the equal-x
commutation relations. we need to quantize the theory, as suggested by dirac, only
on one of the lf hyperplanes. consider, for example, the free scalar theory for which

(x+, x) =

dk+

2k+ha(k+)ei(k+x+kx+) + a(k+)ei(k+x+kx+)i

with ha(k+), a(l+)i = (k+  l+) etc. and 2k+k = m2. we nd easily

h(x+, x), (y+, x)i =

k+>0

dk+

we may change the integration variable to k by making use of kdk+ + k+dk = 0

and employ the integral representation (x) = (i/)pr 

the equal-x commutator



h(x+, x), (y+, x)i =

(x+  y+)

the above eld expansion on the lf, in contrast to the equal-time case, does not involve
the mass parameter m and the same result follows in the massless case also if we assume
that k+ = l+ implies k = l. dening the right and the left movers by (0, x) 
r(x), and (x+, 0)  l(x+) we obtainhr(x), r(y)i = (i/4)(x  y) while
hl(x+), l(y+)i = (i/4)(x+  y+). the symmetry under discussion is responsible

for an appreciable simplication found in the recent study of the gauge theory sm and
the csm on the lf discussed in the next sec..

the model under study can be solved completely using the technique of bosoniza-
tion. the latter consists in the replacement of a known system of fermions with a
theory of bosons which has a completely equivalent physical content, including, for
example, identical spectra, the same current commutation relations and the energy-
momentum tensor when expressed in terms of the currents. the bosonized version is
convenient to study the vacuum structure and it was shown [17] to be given by

here the explicit mass term for the gauge eld parametrized by the constant parameter

the action may be derived by the functional integral method or by the canonical
quantization.

we make the separation: (, x) = ( ) + (, x) and follow it through the
application of the dirac method as done with the ssb above. on the other hand in
the bosonized sm on the lf we recall [8] that ( ) turned out to be q-number operator
and its eigenvalues were shown [8] to characterize the condensate or -vacua [18], which
were shown also to emerge naturally with a continuum normalization in contrast to
what found in the conventional equal-time treatment. we remind [8] also that the chiral
transformation is dened by:    + const.,   , and a  a. this ensures
that the boundary conditions on the  are kept unaltered under such transformations
and our mathematical framework may be considered well posed, before we proceed to
build the canonical hamiltonian framework.

written explicitly the action takes the following form on the lf

where an overdot (a prime) indicates the partial derivative with respect to  ( x).
in order to suppress the nite volume eects we work in the continuum formulation
and require, based on physical considerations, that the elds satisfy the boundary
conditions needed for the existence of their fourier transforms in the spatial variable
x.

we note now that a+ appears in the action as an auxiliary eld, without a kinetic
term. it is clear that the condensate variable may thus be subtracted out from the
theory using the frequently adopted procedure of eld redenition [20] on it: a+ 
a+  2 /(ae), obtaining thereby
lcsm =  +

with h( ) = r dxa(, x), the zero mode associated with the gauge eld a. we

recall that the condensate or -vacua in sm emerged due to the presence in the theory
of three linearly independent operators: the condensate , its canonically conjugate
h( ) and  with the vanishing commutator with the other two while the h lf contained
in it only the eld . the hilbert space could be described in two fashions. selecting 
abd h as forming the complete set of operators led to the chiral vacua while  together
with  led to the description in terms of the condensate or -vacua.

the lagrange equations in the csm follow to be

+ =  e+a,

++a  +a+ = ae2a+ + 2e+,
a+  +a = ae2a.

and for a 6= 1 they lead to:

"2 +

(a  1)# e(, x) = 0,

(10)

(11)

where e = (+a  a+) and g = (e  ae). both the massive and massless scalar
excitations are present in the theory and the tachyons would be absent in the specrtum
if a > 1; the case considered in this paper. we will conrm in the hamiltonian frame-
work below that the e and g represent, in fact, the two independent eld operators
on the lf phase space.

the dirac procedure [7] as applied to the very simple action of the csm is straight-
forward. the canonical momenta are +  0,   e = a  a+,  =  + 2ea
which result in two primary weak constraints +  0 and 1  (    2ea)  0.
a secondary constraint 2  e + ae2a  0 is shown to emerge when we require
the  independence (persistency) of +  0 employing the preliminary hamiltonian

h = hc

where u+ and u1 are the lagrange multiplier elds and hc
nian

and we assume initially the standard equal- poisson brackets : {e(, x), a(, y)} =

 (x  y), {(, x), (, y)} = (x  y) etc.. the persistency requirement
for 1 results in an equation for determining u1. the procedure is repeated with the
following extended hamiltonian which includes in it also the secondary constraint

no more secondary constraints are seen to arise; we are left with the persistency con-
ditions which determine the multiplier elds u1 and u2 while u+ remains undeter-
mined. we also nd14 (c)ij = {i, j} = dij
(2x(x  y)) where i, j = 1, 2 and
d11 = 1, d22 = ae2, d12 = d21 = e and that + has vanishing brackets with 1,2.
the +  0 is rst class weak constraint while 1 and 2, which does not depend on
a+ or +, are second class ones.
we go over from the poisson bracket to the dirac bracket {,}d constructed in

relation to the pair, 1  0 and 2  0
{f (x), g(y)}d = {f (x), g(y)} z z dudv {f (x), i(u)}(c1(u, v))ij{j(v), g(y)}.
(15)
here c1 is the inverse of c and we nd (c1(x, y))ij = bij k(x, y) with b11 = a/(a
1), b22 = 1/[(a  1)e2], b12 = b21= 1/[(a 1)e], and k(x, y) = (x  y)/4. some of
the dirac brackets are {, }d = b11 k(x, y); {, e}d = eb11 k(x, y); {e, e}d =
ae2b11 k(x, y); {, a}d = b12 (xy)/2; {a, e}d = b11 (xy)/2; {a, a}d =
b12x (x  y)/2 and the only nonvanishing one involving a+ or + is {a+, +}d =
(x  y).
the eqns. of motion employ now the dirac brackets and inside them, in view of
their very construction [7], we may set 1 = 0 and 2 = 0 as strong relations. the
hamiltonian is therefore eectively given by he with the terms involving the multipliers
u1 and u2 dropped. the multiplier u+ is not determined since the constraint +  0
continues to be rst class even when the above dirac bracket is employed. the variables
 and a are then removed from the theory leaving behind , e, a+, and + as
the remaining independent variables. the canonical hamiltonian density reduces to
c = e2/2 + (a+e) while a+ = {a+, h lf
hlf
e }d = u+. the surface term in the
canonical lf hamiltonian may be ignored if, say, e(= f+) vanishes at innity. the
variables + and a+ are then seen to describe a decoupled (from  and e) free theory
and we may hence drop these variables as well. the eective lf hamiltonian thus
takes the simple form

h lf

csm =

1

2z dx e2,

(16)

which is to be contrasted with the one found in the conventional treatment [21, 22].
e and g (or e and ) are now the independent variables on the phase space and
the lagrange equations are veried to be recovered for them, which assures us of the
selfconsistency [7]. we stress that in our discussion we do not employ any gauge-xing.
the same result for the hamiltonian could be alternatively obtained15, however, if we
did introduce the gauge-xing constraint a+  0 and made further modication on
{,}d in order to implement a+  0, +  0 as well. that it is accessible on the phase
space to take care of the remaining rst class constraint, but not in the bosonized

14we make the convention that the rst variable in an equal-  bracket refers to the longitudinal

coordinate x  x while the second one to y  y while  is suppressed.

15a similar discussion is encountered also in the lf quantized chern-simons-higgs system [23].

12

lagrangian, follows from the hamiltons eqns. of motion. we recall [8] that in the sm

, , and  = (e/)r dxa were shown to be the independent operators and that
the canonical quantization is peformed via the correspondence i{f, g}d  [f, g]

the matter eld  appeared instead in the lf hamiltonian.

and we nd the following equal- commutators

[e(x), e(y)] = ik(x, y)a2e2/(a  1),
[g(x), e(y)] = 0,
[g(x), g(y)] = ia2e2k(x, y).

(17)

for a > 1, when the tachyons are absent as seen from (6), these commutators are
also physical and the independent eld operators e and g generate the hilbert space
with a tensor product structure of the fock spaces fe and fg of these elds with the
positive denite metric.

we can make, in view of (12), the following lf momentum space expansions

e(x,  ) =

g(x,  ) =

(18)

where the operators (d, g, d, g) satisfy the canonical commutation relations of two
independent harmonic oscillators; the well known set of schwingers bosonic oscillators,
often employed in the angular momentum theory. the expression for the hamiltonian
becomes

(19)

where we have dropped the innite zero-point energy term and note that [3]

pressions for the independent g-oscillators. we verify that [nd(k,  ), nd(l,  )] = 0,

hd(k,  ), d(l,  )i = (k  l), d(k,  )d(k,  ) = (0)nd(k,  ) etc. with similar ex-
[nd(k,  ), ng(l,  )] = 0, hnd(k,  ), d(k,  )i = d(k,  ) etc..
the fock space can hence be built on a basis of eigenstates of the hermitian number
operators nd and ng. the ground state of csm is degenerate and described by |0 >=
|e = 0)  |g} and it carries vanishing lf energy in agreement with the conventional
theory discusion [21, 22]. for a xed k these states, |e = 0)  (g(k,  )n/n!)|0}, are
labelled by the integers n = 0, 1, 2,  . the -vacua are absent in the csm. however,
we recall [8] that in the sm the degenerate chiral vacua are also labelled by such
integers. we remark also that on the lf we work in the minkowski space and that
in our discussion we do not make use of the euclidean space theory action, where
the (classical) vacuum congurations of the euclidean theory gauge eld, belonging
to the distinct topological sectors, are useful, for example, in the functional integral
quantization of the gauge theory.

13

conclusions

the lf hyperplane is seen to be equally appropriate as the conventional one for
quantizing eld theory. the front form formulation is found to be quite transparent
and the physical contents following from the quantized theory agree with those known
in the conventional instant form treatment. evidently, they should not depend on
whether we employ the conventional or the lf coordinates to span the minkowski
space and study the temporal evolution of the quantum dynamical system in t or 
respectively.

we note that in our context the (lf) hyperplanes x = 0 dene the characteristic
surfaces of hyperbolic partial dierential equation. it is known from their mathematical
theory [12] that a solution exists if we specify the initial data on both of the hyperplanes.
from the present discussion and the earlier works [2, 8] we conclude that it is sucient
in the front form treatment to choose one of the hyperplanes, as proposed by dirac [1],
for canonically quantizing the theory. the equal- commutators of the eld operators,
at a xed initial lf-time, form now a part of the initial data instead and we deal with
operator dierential equations. the information on the commutators on the other
characteristic hyperplane seems to be already contained [8] in the quantized theory
and need not be specied separately. as a side comment, the well accepted notion that
a classical model eld theory must be upgraded rst through quantization, before we
confront it with the experimental data, nds here a theoretical re-armation.

the physical hilbert space is obtained in a direct fashion in the lf quantized csm
and sm gauge theories, once the constraints are eliminated and the appreciably reduced
set of independent operators on the lf phase space identied. csm has in it both the
massive and the massless scalar excitations while only the massive one appears in the
sm. there are no condensate or -vacua in csm but they both have degenerate vacuum
structure. in the conventional treatment [18] an extended phase space is employed and
suitable constraints are required to be imposed in order to dene the physical hilbert
space which would then lead to the description of the physical vacuum state. the
functional integral method together with the lf quantization may be an ecient tool
for handling the nonperturbative calculations.

a discussion parallel to the one given here can also be made in the front form theory
of the gauge invariant formulation [22] of the csm. in an earlier work [24], where the
brst-bfv functional integral quantization was employed, it was demonstrated that
this formulation and the gauge noninvariant one in fact lead to the same eective action.
also the brs-bft quantization method proposed [13] recently can be extended to the
front form theory as illustrated in the appendix d for the csm on the lf and where
dierent equivalent actions are obtained following the method.

appendix a: poincare generators on the lf

the poincare generators in coordinate system (x0, x1, x2, x3), satisfy [m, p] =
i(pgpg) and [m, m] = i(mg + mgmg mg) where the
metric is g = diag (1,1,1,1),  = (0, 1, 2, 3) and we take 0123 = +12 = 1. if
we dene ji = (1/2)iklm kl and ki = m0i, where i, j, k, l = 1, 2, 3, we nd [ji, fj] =

14

iijkfk for fl = jl, pl or kl while [ki, kj] = iijkjk, [ki, pl] = ip0gil, [ki, p0] =
ipi, and [ji, p0] = 0.
the lf generators are p+, p, p1, p2, m12 = j3, m+ = k3, m1 = (k1 +
j2)/2  b1, m2 = (k2  j1)/2  b2, m1+ = (k1  j2)/2  s1 and
m2+ = (k2 + j1)/2  s2. we nd [b1, b2] = 0, [ba, j3] = iabbb, [ba, k3] =
iba, [j3, k3] = 0, [s1, s2] = 0, [sa, j3] = iabsb, [sa, k3] = isa where a, b =
1, 2 and 12 = 21 = 1. also [b1, p1] = [b2, p2] = ip +, [b1, p2] = [b2, p1] = 0,
[ba, p ] = ipa, [ba, p +] = 0, [s1, p1] = [s2, p2] = ip , [s1, p2] = [s2, p1] = 0,
[sa, p +] = ipa, [sa, p ] = 0, [b1, s2] = [b2, s2] = ij3, [b1, s1] = [b2, s2] = ik3.
for p = i, and m  l = i(x  x) we nd ba = (x+p a  xap +),
sa = (xp a  xap ), k3 = (xp +  x+p ) and
j3 = (x1p 2  x2p 1). under the
conventional parity operation p: ( x  x, x1,2  x1,2) and (p  p, p1,2 
p1,2), we nd ~j  ~j, ~k   ~k, ba  sa etc.. the six generators pl, mkl
leave x0 = 0 hyperplane invariant and are called kinematical while the remaining
p0, m0k the dynamical ones. on the lf there are seven kinematical generators :
p +, p 1, p 2, b1, b2, j3 and k3 which leave the lf hyperplane, x0 + x3 = 0, invariant
and the three dynamical ones s1, s2 and p  form a mutually commuting set. the k3
which was dynamical becomes now a kinematical; it generates scale transformations
of the lf components of x, p  and m  . we note that each of the set {b1, b2, j3}
and {s1, s2, j3} generates an e2  so(2) t2 algebra; this will be shown below to be
relevant for dening the spin for massless particle. including k3 in each set we nd
two subalgebras each with four elements. some useful identities are eik3 p  eik3 =
e p , eik3 p  eik3 = p , eiv. b p  eiv. b = p  + v. p + 1
2 v2p +, eiv. b p + eiv. b =
2 u2p , eiu. s p  eiu. s =
p +, eiv. b p  eiv. b = p  + vp +, eiu. s p + eiu. s = p + + u. p + 1
p , eiu. s p  eiu. s = p  + up  where p   p = (p 1, p 2), v  v = (v1, v2) and
(v.p )  (v. p ) = v1p 1 + v2p 2 etc. analogous expressions with p  replaced by x 
can be obtained if we use [p , x]  [i, x] = i
 .
appendix b:

lf spin operator. hadrons in lf fock basis

[w, p] = 0

the casimir generators of the poincare group are : p 2  p p and w 2, where
w = (1/2)m p  denes the pauli-lubanski pseudovector.
it follows from
[w, w] = iw p ,
and w.p = 0 that in a representa-
tion charactarized by particular eigenvalues of the two casimir operators we may
simultaneously diagonalize p  along with just one component of w . we have
w + = [j3p ++b1p 2b2p 1], w  = j3p +s1p 2s2p 1, w 1 = k3p 2+b2p s2p +,
and w 2 = [k3p 1 + b1p   s1p +] and it shows that w + has a special place since it
contains only the kinematical generators [8]. on the lf we dene j3 = w +/p + as
the spin operator. it may be shown to commute with p, b1, b2, j3, and k3. for m 6= 0
we may use the parametrizations p : (p = (m2 + p2)/(2p+), p+ = (m/2)e, p1 =
v1p+, p2 = v2p+) and p : (1, 1, 0, 0)(m/2) in the rest frame. we have p 2(p) = m2i
3 ] = m2s(s + 1)i where s assumes half-integer
and w (p)2 = w (p)2 = m2[j 2
values. starting from the rest state |p; m, s, , ..i with j3 |p; m, s, , ..i =  |p; m, s, , ..i
we may build an arbitrary eigenstate of p +, p ,j3 (and p  ) on the lf by

1 + j 2

2 + j 2

15

|p+, p; m, s, , ..i = ei(v. b)eik3|p; m, s, , ..i

if we make use of the following identity [2]

j3(p) = j3 + v1b2  v2b1 = ei(v. b) j3 ei(v. b)

introducing also the operators

we nd j3 |p+, p; m, s, , ..i =  |p+, p; m, s, , ..i.
ja = (j3p a + w a)/qp p, a = 1, 2, which do, however, contain dynamical genera-
tors, we verify that [ji,jj] = iijkjk.
for m = 0 case when p+ 6= 0 a convenient parametrization is p : (p =
p+v2/2, p+, p1 = v1p+, p2 = v2p+) and p : (0, p+, 0). we have w 2(p) = (s2
1 +
2 )p+2 and [w1, w2](p) = 0, [w +, w1](p) = ip+w2(p), [w +, w2](p) = ip+w1(p)
s2
showing that w1, w2 and w + generate the algebra so(2) t2. the eigenvalues of w 2
are hence not quantized and they vary continuously. this is contrary to the experience
so we impose that the physical states satisfy in addition w1,2| p; m = 0, ..i = 0. hence
w = p and the invariant parameter  is taken to dene as the spin of the massless
particle. from w +(p)/p+ = j3 we conclude that  assumes half-integer values as
well. we note that w w = 2p p = 0 and that on the lf the denition of the
spin operator appears unied for massless and massive particles. a parallel discussion
based on p 6= 0 may also be given.
as an illustration consider the three particle state on the lf with the total eigen-
values p+,  and p.
it may be written
as (|x1p+, k1 ; 1i|x2p+, k2 ; 2i|x3p+, k3 ; 3i ) with p3
i=1 xi = 1, p3
i=1 ki = 0, and
 = p3
i=1 i. aplying ei(p. b)/p+ on it we obtain (|x1p+, k1 + x1p; 1i|x2p+, k2 +
x2p; 2i|x3p+, k3 + x3p; 3i ) now with p 6= 0. the xi and ki
indicate relative
(invariant) parameters and do not depend upon the reference frame. the xi is the
fraction of the total longitudinal momentum carried by the ith particle while ki
its
transverse momentum. the state of a pion with momentum (p+, p), for example,
may be expressed as an expansion over the lf fock states constituted by the dierent
number of partons [5]

in the standard frame with p = 0

where the summation is over all the fock states n and spin projections i, with idxi =

dxid2ki
xi 163|n : xip+, xip + ki, ii n/(x1, k1, 1; x2, ...)

n/(x, k) indicates the probability amplitude for nding inside the pion the partons
in the fock state n carrying the 3-momenta (xip+, xip + ki ). the fock state of the

| : p+, pi =xn,z i
idxi (p xi  1), and id2ki = idki 2(p ki ). the wave function of the parton
pion is also o the energy shell : p ki > p.
the discrete symmetry transformations may also be dened on the lf fock states
[5, 8] for example, under the conventional parity p the spin operator j3 is not left
invariant. we may rectify this by dening lf parity operation by p lf = eij1p.
we nd then b1  b1, b2  b2, p   p , p 1  p 1, p 2  p 2 etc.
such
that p lf|p+, p; m, s, , ..i  |p+,p1, p2; m, s, , ..i. similar considerations apply for

16

charge conjugation and time inversion. for example, it is straightforward to construct

 s(l)s1(l),

the free lf dirac spinor (p) = [2p++ + (m  apa) ] /q2p+m which is also
an eigenstate of j3 with eigenvalues 1/2. here  = 0/2 = /2 = (),
()2 = , and (p)   with 0  = . the conventional (equal-time) spinor can
also be constructed by the procedure analogous to that followed for the lf spinor and it
has the well known form con(p) = (m + .p) /q2m(p0 + m). under the conventional
parity operation p : (p) = c0(p) (since we must require  = l
etc.). we nd (p) = c[2p + (m  apa) +] /q2pm. for p 6= p it is not
proportional to (p) in contrast to the result in the case of the usual spinor where
0con(p0,~p) = con(p) for e > 0 (and 0con(p0,~p) = con(p) for e < 0).
however, applying parity operator twice we do show (p) = c2(p) hence leading
to the usual result c2 = 1. the lf parity operator over spin 1/2 dirac spinor is
p lf = c (2j1) 0 and the corresponding transform of  is shown to be an eigenstate of
j3.

in order to keep the discussion16 simple we would assume  to be a consant back-
ground eld. so that l =   v (). dirac procedure is applied now to construct
hamiltonian eld theory which may be quantized. we may avoid using distribuitions
if we restrict x to a nite interval from r/2 to r/2 . the limit to the contin-
uum (r   ), however, must [25] be taken later to remove the spurious nite
volume eects. expanding  by fourier series we obtain (, x)   + (, x) =

qn( ) eiknx where kn = n(2/r), n = 0,1,2, ...
ipn kn qn qn  r dx v (). the
and the discretized theory lagrangian becomes
momenta conjugate to qn are pn = iknqn and the canonical lf hamiltonian is
found to be r dx v ( + (, x)). the primary constraints are thus p0  0
and
n  pn  iknqn  0 for n 6= 0 . we follow the standard dirac procedure [5] and
nd three weak constraints p0  0,   r dx v ()  0, and n  0 for n 6= 0 on
the phase space and they are shown to be second class. we nd for n 6= 0 and m 6= 0:
{n, p0} = 0, {n, m} = 2iknm+n,0, {n, } = {pn, } = (1/r)r dx [ v () 
v ([ + q0]/r) ] eiknx  n/r, {p0, p0} = {,  } = 0, {p0, } = (1/r)
r dx v ()  /r.
implement rst the pair of constraints p0  0,   0 by
modifying the poisson brackets to the star bracket {} dened by {f, g} = {f, g} 
[{f, p0} {, g}  (p0  )](/r)1. we may then set p0 = 0 and  = 0 as strong
equalities. we nd by inspection that the brackets {} of the remaining variables coin-
cide with the standard poisson brackets except for the ones involving q0 and pn (n 6= 0):
{q0, pn} = {q0, n} = (1n) . for example, if v () = (/4) (2  m2/)2 ,
  0, m 6= 0 we nd {q0, pn} [{ 3 ( + q0/r)2  m2 }r + 6( + q0/r)r dx +
3 r dx 2 ] =  3 [ 2( + q0/r) rqn +r dx 2 eiknx ].

these results follow immediately if we worked directly in the continuum formulation;
we do have to handle generalized functions now. in the lf hamiltonian theory we
have an additional new ingredient in the form of the constraint equation. elimination
of  using it would lead to a nonlocal lf hamiltonian corresponding to the local one
in the equal-time formulation. at the tree or classical level the integrals appearing in
in the constraint eq. are convergent and when r   it leads to v () = 0. in equal-
time theory this is essentially added to it as an external constraint based on physical
considerations. in the renormalized theory [15] the constraint equation describes the
high order quantum corrections to the tree level value of the condensate.

the quantization is performed via the correspondence i{f, g}d  [f, g]. hence

a(k,  ) satisfy the canonical equal- commutation relations,
(k  k) etc.. the vacuum state is dened by a(k,  )|vaci = 0 , k > 0 and the tree

its discussion at the tree level

hamiltonian is then symmetric under   . for  6= 0 this symmetry is violated
and the system is in a broken or asymmetric phase.
the extension to 3 + 1 dimensions and to global continuous symmetry is straight-
forward18. consider real scalar elds a(a = 1, 2, ..n) which form an isovector of global
internal symmetry group o(n). we now write a(x, x,  ) = a + a(x, x,  ) and the
lagrangian density is l = [ aa  (1/2)(ia)(ia)  v ()], where i = 1, 2 indicate
the transverse space directions. the taylor series expansion of the constraint equations
a = 0 gives a set of coupled equations r v a() + v ab()r dxb + v abc()r dxbc/2 +
sults. the lf symmetry generators are found to be g( ) = ir d2xdxc(t)cdd
= r d2k dk (k) ac(k, k)(t)cdad(k, k) where ,  = 1, 2, .., n(n  1)/2 , are the

group indices, t are hermitian and antisymmetric generators of o(n), and ac(k, k)
(ac(k, k)) is creation ( destruction) operator contained in the momentum space ex-
pansion of c. these are to be contrasted with the generators in the equal-time theory,

leads to the conventional theory re-

q(x0) =r d3x j 0 = ir d3x(0a)(t)abb  i(t)ar d3x(da/dx0). all the symme-

try generators thus annihilate the lf vacuum and the ssb is now seen in the broken
symmetry of the quantized theory hamiltonian. the criteria for the counting of the
number of goldstone bosons on the lf is found to be the same as in the conventional
theory. in contrast, the rst term on the right hand side of q(x0) does annihilate the
conventional theory vacuum but the second term gives now non-vanishing contributions
for some of the (broken) generators. the symmetry of the conventional theory vacuum
is thereby broken while the quantum hamiltonian remains invariant. the physical
content of ssb in the instant form and the front form, however, is the same though
achieved by dierent descriptions. alternative proofs on the lf, in two dimensions,
can be given of the colemans theorem related to the absence of goldstone bosons; we
are unable to implement the second class constraints over the phase space.

brs-bft quantization on the lf of the csm19

recently, it was shown [8] that the well known condensate or -vacua in the sm
could be obtained by a straightforward quantization of the theory on the light-front
(lf). the procedure adopted was the one proposed earlier in connection with the front
form description of the ssb as described earlier in these lectures. the scalar eld of
the equivalent bosonized sm is separated, based on physical considerations, into the
dynamical bosonic condensate and the quantum uctuation elds. the dirac procedure
is then followed in order to construct the hamiltonian formulation and the quantized
theory. the -vacua were shown [8] to come out naturally along with their continuum
normalization. it is then rather important to understand as to how and why the vacuum

structure in the lf quantized csm should come out to be quite dierent; as is known
from the rather elaborate studies on csm in the conventional framework. we could
work with the standard dirac method but the recently proposed bft procedure which
is elegant and avoids the computation of dirac brackets. it would thus get tested on
the lf as well and it also allows for constructing (new) eective lagrangian theories.
we convert the two second class constraints of the bosonized csm with a > 1
into rst class constraints according to the bft formalism. we obtain then the rst
class hamiltonian from the canonical hamiltonian and recover the db using poisson
brackets in the extended phase space. the corresponding rst class lagrangian is then
found by performing the momentum integrations in the generating functional.

(a) conversion to first class constrained dynamical system

the bosonized csm model (for a > 1) is described by the action

scsm = z d2x (cid:20)

where a is a regularization ambiguity which enters when we calculate the fermionic
determinant in the fermionic csm. the action in the lf coordinates takes the form

scsm = z d2x (cid:20) 1

2

(+a  a+)2 +  + + 2ea+ + ae2a+a(cid:21) ,

(21)

we now make the separation, in the scalar eld (a generalized function) : (, x) =

( ) + (, x). the lagrangian density then becomes

l =

(+a  a+)2 +  + + ae2[a+ +

(+ + +)]a,

(22)

we note that the dynamical elds are a and  while a+ has no kinetic term. on
making a redenition of the (auxiliary) eld a+ we can recast the action on the lf in
the following form

scsm = z dx (cid:20)  +

( a  a+)2  2e a + ae2a+a(cid:21) ,

the canonical momenta are given by

+ = 0,

a  a+  2e,

(23)

(24)

we follow now the diracs standard procedure in order to build an hamiltonian frame-
work on the lf. the denition of the canonical momenta leads to two primary con-
straints

+  0,
1  (  )  0

20

(25)
(26)

and we derive one secondary constraint

2   + +2e + ae2a  0.

(27)

this one follows when we require the  independence (e.g., the persistency) of the
primary constraint + with respect to the preliminary hamiltonian

where hc is the canonical hamiltonian

hc

l.f. = z dx (cid:20) 1

2

h = hc

l.f. +z dx u++ +z dx u11,
( + 2e)2 + ( + 2e)a+  ae2a+a(cid:21) ,

(28)

(29)

and we employ the standard equal- poisson brackets. the u+ and u1 denote the
lagrange multiplier elds. the persistency requirement for 1 give conditions to de-
termine u1. the hamiltonian is next extended to include also the secondary constraint

he

l.f. = hc

l.f. +z dx u++ +z dx u11 +z dx u22

(30)

and the procedure is now repeated with respect to the extended hamiltonian. for the
case a > 1, no more secondary constraints are seen to arise and we are left only with
the persistency conditions which determine the multipliers u1 and u2 while u+ is left
undetermined. we also nd20 {i, j} = dij
(2x(x  y)) where i, j = 1, 2 and
d11 = 1, d22 = ae2, d12 = d21 = e and + is shown to have vanishing brackets with
1,2. the +  0 constitutes a rst class constraint on the phase space; it generates
local transformations of a+ which leave the he invariant, {+, he} = 2  0. the
1, 2 constitute a set of second class constraints and do not involve a+ or +. it is
very convenient, though not necessary, to add to the set of constraints on the phase
space the (accessible) gauge xing constraint a+  0. it is evident from that such a
gauge freedom is not available at the lagrangian level. we will also implement (e.g.,
turn into strong equalities) the (trivial) pair of weak constraints a+  0, +  0
by dening the dirac brackets with respect to them.
it is easy to see that for the
other remaining dynamical variables the corresponding dirac brackets coincide with the
standard poisson brackets. the variables a+, + are thus removed from the discussion,
leaving behind a constrained dynamical system with the two second class constraints
1, 2 and the light-front hamiltonian

h l.f. =

1

2z dx ( + 2e)2 +z dx u11 +z dx u22

(31)

which will be now handled by the bft procedure.

we introduce the following linear combinations i, i = 1, 2, of the above constraints
20we make the convention that the rst variable in an equal-  bracket refers to the longitudinal

coordinate x  x while the second one to y  y

(32)

where c1 = 1/q2(1  e/m), c2 = 1/q2(1 + e/m), m 2 = ae2, and a > 1. they satisfy

{i,j} = ij(2x(x  y))

(33)

and thus diagonalize the constraint algebra.

we now introduce new auxiliary elds i in order to convert the second class
constraint i into rst class ones in the extended phase space. following bft [13]
we require these elds to satisfy

{a(or ), i} = 0,
{(or ), i} = 0,
{i(x), j(y)} = ij(x, y) = ji(y, x),

(34)

where ij is a constant and antisymmetric matrix. the strongly involutive modied

constraints ei satisfying the abelian algebra
{ei, ej} = 0
as well as the boundary conditions, ei |i=0= i are then postulated to take the form

of the following expansion

(35)

ei(a, , , ; j) = i +

xn=1 e(n)

i

the rst order correction terms in this innite series are written as

e(1)

{i,j} + {e(1)

(36)

(37)

(38)

(39)

the rst class constraint algebra of ei then leads to the following condition:

or

(2x(x  y))ij +z dw dz xik(x, w)kl(w, z)xjl(y, z) = 0.

there is clearly some arbritrariness in the appropriate choice of ij and xij which
corresponds to the canonical transformation in the extended phase space. we can take
without any loss of generality the simple solutions,

ij(x, y) = ij(x  y)
xij(x, y) = ijx(x  y),

ing the the following strong involution condition for ef with the rst class constraints

we make a side remark on the dirac formulation for dealing with the systems with
second class constraints by using the dirac bracket (db), rather than extending the
phase space. in fact, the poisson brackets of the modied (gauge invariant) variables

ef in the bft formalism are related [13] to the db, which implement the constraints
i  0 in the problem under discussion, by the relation {f, g}d = {ef,eg} |i=0. in view

of only the linear rst order correction in csm the computation of the right hand side
is quite simple. we list some of the dirac brackets

fh =

which already commute with the constraints eti. we do also check that {fh,fh} = 0
and we may identify fh with the brs hamiltonian. this completes the operatorial
i into the rst class one with the hamiltonian fh and (abelian) constraints eti.

conversion of the original second class system with the hamiltonian hc and constraints

(54)

(c)- first class lagrangian

we consider now the partition function of the model in order to construct the la-

grangian corresonding to fh in the canonical hamiltonian formulation discussed above.

we start by representing each of the auxiliary eld i by a pair of elds i, i, i =

1, 2 dened by

i =

1
2

i z du (x  u) i(u)

such that i, i satisfy

e.g., the (standard heisenberg type) canonical poisson brackets.

{i, j} = ij(x  y)

etc.,

the phase space partition function is given by the faddeev formulae

z =z dadddd1d1d2d2

2yi,j=1

(ei)(j)det | {ei, j} | eis,

where

s =z d2x(cid:16) a +   + 1 1 + 2 2  fh(cid:17) z d2x l,

with the hamiltonian density fh corresponding to the hamiltonian fh which is now

expressed in terms of (i, i) rather than in terms of i. the gauge-xing conditions
i are chosen such that the determinants occurring in the functional measure are non-
vanishing. moreover, i may be taken to be independent of the momenta so that they
correspond to the faddeev-popov type gauge conditions.

(55)

(56)

(57)

(58)

25

we will now verify in the unitary gauge, dened by the original second class con-
straints: i  i = 0, i=1,2 being employed in the partition function, do in fact lead
to the original lagrangian. we check that the determinants in the functional measure
are non-vanishing and eld independent while the product of delta functionals reduces
to

(  )( + 2e + m 2a)(1  41)(2  42)

(59)

delta functional. the second delta functional is exponentiated as usual and we name
the integration variable as a+ for convenience. the functional integral over 1 and 2

since  is absent from fh we can perform functional integration over it using the rst
are easily performed due to the presence of the delta functionals and it also reduces fh

to ( + 2e)2/2. the functional integrations over the then decoupled variables 1 and
2 give rise to constant factors which are absorbed in the normalization. the partition
function in the unitary gauge thus becomes

z =z daddda+eis,

with

s =z d2x(cid:20) a +   + ( + 2e + m 2a)a+ 

1
2

( + 2e)2(cid:21) ,

(60)

(61)

performing the shift   2e and doing subsequently a gaussian integral over 
we obtain the original bosonized lagrangian with  eliminated by the eld redenition
of a+. it is interesting to recall that while constructing the lf hamiltonian framework
we eliminated the variable a+ making use of the gauge freedom on the lf phase space
and it gave rise to appreciable simplication. however, on going over to the rst
class lagrangian formalism using the partition functional this variable reappears as it
should, since the initial bosonized action is not gauge invariant due to the presence of
the mass term for the gauge eld. making other acceptable choices for gauge-functions
we can arrive at dierent eective lagrangians for the system under consideration. it
is interesting to recall that in the fermionic lagrangian the right-handed component
of the fermionic eld describes a free eld and only the left-handed one is gauged.
eld while only the left component is gauged. it is also clear from our discussion that

fh proposed above is not unique and we could modify it so that it still lead to the

original lagrangian in the unitary gauge. the corresponding rst class lagrangian
would produce still other gauge-xed eective lagrangians. it will be interesting to
study the models on the lf with more avours and accompanying non-abelian gauge
symmetry using the bft-bfv formalism.
