abstract

we study the strong coupling limit of the bethe ansatz solutions in the
massive thirring model. we nd analytical expressions for the energy eigen-
values for the vacuum state as well as nparticle n hole states. this formula
is compared with the numerical results and is found to achieve a very good
agreement.

also, it is found that the 2particle 2 hole and higher particlehole
states describe n free bosons states in this limit. the behaviors of the
strong coupling limit of the boson mass for various model calculations are
examined. we discuss an ambiguity of the coupling constant normalization
due to the current regularization.

1 introduction

recent calculations for the massive thirring model have presented a debate
over the energy spectrum of the bound states [1-4]. several dierent methods
give dierent results on the spectrum of the bound state. for a long time,
people have believed that the semiclassical results by dashen et al.[5] are
exact in spite of the fact that they took into account only the lowest order
quantum uctuations in the path integral method. however, the recent cal-
culation by the light cone procedure shows that there is only one bound state,
and the spectrum of the bound state energy as the function of the coupling
constant is dierent from the semiclassical result [1-3]. further, the recent
calculations based on the bethe ansatz solutions [4] present a numerical proof
that there is only one bound state, and the spectrum seems to be consistent
with the light cone results.

in this paper, we present analytical calculations of the strong coupling
limit of the bethe ansatz solutions for the massive thirring model and show
that the analytical expressions obtained here agree very well with those calcu-
lated by numerically solving the periodic boundary condition (pbc) equa-
tions of the bethe ansatz solutions [6,7]. here, we obtain the energy eigen-
values of the vacuum, 1p1h states (symmetric and asymmetric cases ) and
2p2h and higher particle hole states (symmetric case). the analytical for-
mula shows that the n particlen hole state is just n times 1p1h state
energy (a boson mass). therefore, there is only one boson state in the mas-
sive thirring model. this shows that the n particlen hole states are all
scattering states.
further, we show the behaviors of the strong coupling limit of the bo-
son mass for various model calculations.
it turns out that the analytical
expression of the boson mass at the strong coupling limit with the bethe
ansatz solutions is dierent from the light cone prediction. this may indi-
cate that the normalization ambiguity of the coupling constant due to the
fermion current regularization in the massive thirring model is dierent from
the massless thirring model. for the massless thirring model, klaiber [8]
proves that the coupling constant has a normalization ambiguity which arises
from the fermion current regularization. in the case of the massive thirring
model, it is expected that the same type of the coupling constant ambiguity
may well appear. however, we will see later that the normalization ambiguity
of the coupling constant is more complicated than expected for the massive
thirring model.

in the next section, we briey describe the bethe ansatz method which
is applied to solving the massive thirring model. in section iii, we discuss
analytical expressions for the energy eigenvalues with the strong coupling
expansion. then, section iv treats numerical calculations of the pbc equa-
tions in the strong coupling region and we compare them with the analytical
expressions. in section v, we examine the boson mass at the strong coupling
limit. finally, section vi summarizes what we have understood in this paper.

2 massive thirring model and bethe ansatz

solutions

the massive thirring model is a 1+1 dimensional eld theory with current
current interactions [4,11], and can be solved by the bethe ansatz method
[4,6,7]. in this case, the eigenvalue problem is reduced to solving the following
pbc equations,

(2.1)

where i denotes the rapidity of the particle and nis are integer. m0, l
and gb denote the bare mass, the box length and the coupling constant,
respectively.

2.1 vacuum state

the pbc equations for the vacuum which is lled with negative energy par-
ticles ( i = i  i ) can be written as
tan1(cid:20) 1
(i = 0,1, ..,n0),

(i  j)(cid:21) ,

where l0 is dened as l0 = m0l and n0 = (n  1)/2. in this case, the
vacuum energy ev can be written as

ev =

xi=n0

m0 cosh i.

(2.3)

2.2 1p  1h state
for one particle-one hole (1p  1h) states, we take out one negative energy
particle (i0-th particle) and put it into a positive energy state. in this case,
the pbc equations become

i 6= i0

i = i0

we denote by e(i0)

(2.5)

2.3 2p  2h states
for two particle-two hole (2p  2h) states, we take out the i1th and the
i2th particles and put them into positive energy states. the pbc equations
for the two particle-two hole states become

(2.7)

here, we note that the symmetric case ( i1 = i2 ) always gains the energy
and therefore is lower than other asymmetric cases of 2p  2h states. higher
particle-hole states are constructed just in the same way as above.

3 strong coupling expansion

here, we present the strong coupling expansion of the pbc equations. we
take the limit of gb   and obtain the energy eigenvalues analytically.
this limit of gb   can be taken since there is no coupling constant
renormalization in the massive thirring model [15].

3.1 vacuum state

first, we consider the strong coupling limit for the vacuum [16]. we assume
that gb is much larger than any of the rapidity i, namely,

in this case, eq.(2.2) becomes in terms of bi = gbl0i,

gb  i.

bi = 8xj6=i

1

bi  bj

.

(3.1)

(3.2)

further, the vacuum energy is written as

ev = m0

n0

xi=n0

cosh

bigbl0  m0  2m0

(1 +

b2
i

2gbl0

n0

xi=1

).

(3.3)

since bis have the symmetry of bi = bi, we can rewrite eq.(3.2) as

b2
i = 16

n0

xj=1

b2
i
i  b2
b2

j

+ 12

(i = 1,   , n0).

from this equation, we can easily obtain

n0

xi=1

b2
i = 8n0(n0  1) + 12n0.

(3.4)

(3.5)

therefore, the vacuum energy can be explicitly written up to 1/gb order,

ev = (2n0 + 1)m0 

1

gbl

[8n0(n0  1) + 12n0] .

(3.6)

3.2 1p  1h state ( symmetric )
next, we treat the 1p 1h states [15]. we assign the positive energy particle
by i0. in the strong coupling limit, eqs.(2.10) become

sinh i =

sinh i0 =

(i + i0)

(3.7a)

(i0 + j) 

4

gb(i0 + j)

+ ...# .

(3.7b)

where () denote the step function. these equations have two solutions,
the symmetric and the asymmetric solutions. for the symmetric case, one
easily sees, since i = i

i0 = 0.

(3.8)

also, for other is, the equations can be rewritten using bis,

b2
i = 16

n0

xj=1

b2
i
i  b2
b2

(i = 1,   , n0).

(3.9)

in this case, we can evaluate the energy of 1p  1h symmetric case in the
same way as the vacuum and obtain

e(0)
1p1h = (2n0  1)m0 

1

gbl

[8n0(n0  1) + 4n0] .

(3.10)

therefore, the 1p 1h energy for the i0 = 0 case with respect to the vacuum
becomes

e(0)

1p1h = 2m0 +

8n0
gbl

.

(3.11)

3.3 1p  1h states ( asymmetric )

now, we discuss the asymmetric solutions. in this case, we obtain the fol-
lowing coupled equations up to 1/gb.

(3.20)

3.4 2p  2h and higher particlehole states
now, we consider 2p  2h and higher particlehole states. in this case, the
symmetric solutions always gain the energy. therefore, we only treat the
symmetric solution here. due to the symmetry, we can easily nd

0 = 0.

(3.21)

let us rst consider the 2p2h conguration. we assume that the i0th and
the i0th particles are in the positive energy state. in this case, eqs.(2.12)
reduce to

b2
i = 16

n01

xj=1
bi = 

b2
i
i  b2
b2
4
bi

j

+ 12

(i 6= i0),

(i = i0).

note that this leads to the stringlike congurations since the solution for
bi0 becomes pure imaginary. that is,

(3.22a)

(3.22b)

(3.23)

(3.24)

(3.25)

in terms of i0, this becomes

bi0 = 2i.

i0 = 

2

gbl0

i.

therefore, the rapidity interval  of the string becomes

 =

4

gbl0

i + o


i

3

g

2
b


 ,

where we explicitly write the behavior of the next order of 1/gb expansion.
on the other hand, bergkno and thacker [6] assume that the rapidity

interval of the string behaves for large gb as

bt =

4
gb

i.

8

(3.26)

this behavior as the function of gb does not agree with eq.(3.25) which is a
solution of the pbc equation. therefore, the string congurations taken by
bergkno and thacker are not consistent with the string-like solution that
satises the pbc equations. but this is not at all surprising if one considers
the way of obtaining the string congurations by bergkno and thacker.
they assume that the wave functions of the particles should not diverge at
xi =  as a sucient condition. however, this cannot happen due to the
two reasons. the rst reason is that one constructs the eld theory in the
box of 0  xi  l. therefore, the boundary is always periodic, that is, the
wave functions at xi = l and xi = 0 are the same. the second reason is
more physical. the interactions between particles considered here are always
repulsive. therefore, the wave functions cannot diverge at any points of the
space, since they are in the scattering states as bare particles.

to avoid the confusions, we clarify the string picture. in the nonlinear
schrdinger model, the string corresponds to the bound states of the particles
since they make bound states due to the attractive  type interaction.
however, this is only possible for the bosonic particles. for fermions, there
is neither two particle bound state nor three or higher particle bound state
in the massive
due to the pauli principle with the  type interaction.
thirring model, therefore, we should not consider the string conguration
which simulates the many particle bound states.

now, in the same way as the vacuum case, we obtain the energy for the

2p  2h state
e(0)
2p2h = (2n0  3)m0 

1

gbl

[8n0(n0  1)  4n0] ,

(3.27)

where we have ignored those terms which vanish when l   with n0/l
nite. therefore, the 2p  2h energy with respect to the vacuum becomes

e(0)

2p2h = 4m0 +

16n0
gbl

.

(3.28)

for higher p  h states, we can evaluate the energy just in the same way as
the 2p  2h state case. for n-particle-n-hole states, the energy with respect
to the vacuum can be written as

e(0)

npnh = 2nm0 +

8nn0
gbl

.

(3.29)

it is important to nd that the np  nh state energy is just n times as large
as that of 1p  1h state energy, that is,

e(0)

npnh = ne(0)

1p1h.

(3.30)

this shows that the n-particle-n-hole states are composed of n free bosons in
this limit. this result is consistent with the numerical calculations presented
in ref.[4].

9

4 numerical method

we solve the pbc equations by the newton method. the type of equation
we want to solve can be schematically written as

g(f ) = 0

(4.1)

where f = (f1, f2, .., fn ) are the n variables that should be determined. g
is some function. first, we denote some initial solution by f0. we expand
eq.(4.1) near f0 as

f = f0 + x

g(f0) +

g(f0)

f0

x = 0.

(4.2)

(4.3)

we solve this equation for x and put them into eq.(4.1). this leads to a
new set of f , and we consider f as a new f0 and repeat the same procedure
until we get some convergent results for f .

this method has a great advantage over the iteration method proposed
in ref.[4], namely it gives a good convergence even for the strong coupling
region. however, the matrix diagonalization can be possible only for a few
thousand of matrix dimensions if we have to know all of the eigenvalues. it
is found that the present calculations agree perfectly with those calculated
in ref.[4].

it should also be interesting to check the accuracy of eqs.(3.6), (3.10)
and (3.20).
in table 1, we show the comparison of the vacuum energies,
the 1p  1h (symmetric) and 1p  1h (asymmetric) energies between the
analytical expressions and the numerical calculations with the number of
particles of n = 1601. as can be seen from the table 1, we nd quite
a good agreement between the predictions of the strong coupling expansion
and the exact numerical calculations. this indicates that the strong coupling
expansion is indeed a good approximate scheme.

5 bound states at the strong coupling limit

5.1 bound state

now, we calculate the bound state of the massive thirring model at the
strong coupling limit. in ref.[4], fujita et al. showed that there is one isolated
boson state and all the other states are continuum states. therefore, the 1p-
1h continuum energy should start from the free fermion antifermion mass,
that is twice the physical fermion mass.

1

m =

2 (cid:16)e(1)

1p1h  ev(cid:17) .
thus, the bound state mass m can be dened as

 .


m = 2m lim

the e(1)

1p1h is given for the large

thus, at the large l and  limit, e(1)

finally, from eq.(5.2) and eq.(5.4), we obtain the bound state mass as

this result can be compared with the prediction of fujita and ogura in

(5.6)

where g0 is the schwinger type coupling constant [8,9]. as can be seen, they
are dierent from each other if we assume gb = g0. in ref.[4], it was shown
that the bethe ansatz solutions for several cases of the coupling constant

11

are consistent with those of innite momentum frame calculation by fujita
and ogura [1] with the identication of gb = g0. however, it became also
apparent that the boson mass calculated by the bethe ansatz solution starts
to deviate from the light cone result in the strong coupling region. this
dierence may well be related to the normalization ambiguity of the coupling
constant in the massive thirring model.

5.2 coupling constant ambiguity

as klaiber pointed out long time ago, there is an ambiguity of the coupling
constant in the massless thirring model. he proves that the coupling con-
stant is related to each other depending on the regularization. we briey
review it in the appendix a.

the results of the boson mass at the strong coupling limit for the light
cone and the bethe ansatz method indicate that the coupling constant am-
biguity may well be dierent from eq.(a.8) for the massive thirring model.
from the comparison of the numerical calculations and analytical evaluations
between the light cone and the bethe ansatz solutions, we can anticipate the
following relation between g0 and the bethe ansatz coupling constant gb

gb = g0


22

b(cid:16)1  22

b + g0



 ,

(5.7)

where b is a free parameter. in this case, the boson mass of the bethe ansatz
solutions at the strong coupling becomes identical to the light cone result.
if we take b  10, then the agreement between the light cone result and
the bethe ansatz solutions become very good for whole range of the coupling
constant. from eq.(5.7), gb becomes for the small value of g0

for the large value of g0, we obtain

gb  g0.
22

gb  g0

this can be derived if we assume the following relation for s and t

t =

where x is given as the solution of the following equation,

"gb

(5.8)

(5.9a)

(5.9b)

(5.10)

up to now, we do not know any physically simple meaning of choosing the
fermion current regularization which corresponds to eq.(5.10). further stud-
ies of the normalization ambiguity of the coupling constant arising from the
fermion current regularization would be very interesting since we believe
that it may well be related to some symmetry which is hidden in the massive
thirring model.

6 conclusions

we have presented numerical calculations as well as the analytical expressions
of the energy eigenvalues of the vacuum and n particle n hole states in the
strong coupling regions. it is found that the analytical expressions agree very
well with the numerical values of the vacuum and 1p1h state energies for
the large values of the coupling constant.
from the analytical expressions, we nd that the 2p2h and higher parti-
cle hole states appear as free boson states in the strong coupling limit. this is
consistent with the recent proof [13] that the s-matrix factorization assumed
by zamolodchikov and zamolodchikov [14] is violated at the quantum level,
and therefore, the spectrum predicted by the s-matrix factorization is only
semiclassical.

we have also obtained the boson mass m at the strong coupling limit
analytically. to compare the present result with other calculations, we write
here the expressions of the boson mass at the strong coupling limit for various
calculations.

where mdhn denotes the result of the semiclassical calculation by dashen
et al.
, mfo is the prediction of the light cone calculation by fujita and
ogura, and the present result is denoted by mba. if we identify gb = g0,
then mba is dierent from the light cone calculation.
at the present stage, we believe that the coupling constant normalization
arising from the fermion current regularization in the massive thirring model
is slightly dierent from the massless thirring model. it may well be that
the regularization ambiguity is related to some hidden symmetry which is
not clearly understood up to now.

we would like to thank m. hiramoto and a. ogura for helpful discussions

and comments.

a coupling constant ambiguity of the mass-

less thirring model

here, we briey review the normalization ambiguity of the coupling constant
in the massless thirring model [8,12,17].

for the right mover fermion eld r, we can express it by the massless

boson elds r and l as

where s and t are free parameters which satisfy the following constraint

r  eisritl

(a.1)

the s and t can be expressed in terms of the boson coupling constant  as

s2  t2 = 4.

(a.2)

s =

1

2   4



+ ! ,

t =

2   4

  ! .

(a.3)

now, the fermion current regularization gives another constraint. for exam-
ple, schwingers regularization (g0) which makes the fermion current regu-
larization only in terms of the space coordinate point splitting implies that

t =

g0
2

(s  t).

in this case, one obtains the following equation,

=

on the other hand, johnsons regularization (g) which makes the fermion
current regularization in terms of the space-time coordinate point splitting
in a symmetric fashion implies that

t =

g

s.

in this case, one obtains the following equation,

.

therefore, one obtains the relation between g0 and g as written

g0 =
