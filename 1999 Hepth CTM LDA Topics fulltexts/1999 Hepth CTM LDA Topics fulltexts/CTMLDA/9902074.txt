introduction one many interesting developments arise maldacenas conjecture  concerns study large n qcd. known construct dual gravity theory su (3) gauge theory six quark avors, even dual pure su (n ) theory, hoped gravity duals known share many properties everyday qcd. main properties seek asymptotic freedom ultraviolet connement infrared. four space-time dimensions, maldacena conjecture originally applied n = 4 supersymmetric yang-mills {$9711200$} theories less supersymmetry still conformal {$9711200$}. since -function zero theories, behave like ordinary qcd. witten proposed supersymmetric yang-mills nite temperature model suited comparison qcd {$9711200$}. dimensional euclidean gauge theory nite temperature equivalent theory 1 noncompact directions euclidean time compactied circle. large distances theory acts like nonsupersymmetric euclidean yang-mills theory 1 dimensions. hence, one expects nd area law behavior gap. gravity dual nite temperature super yang-mills nonex- tremal black hole ads space. using this, witten able argue bulk dilaton wave equation discrete spectrum, implying gap boundary theory. also demonstrated area law space-like wilson lines. later shown nite temperature theory exhibits magnetic screening {$9711200$}. also mini-industry comparing dual gravity results lattice results {$9711200$}, reasonable agreement {$9711200$}. however, uv nite temperature theories eectively become supersymmetric one extra dimension. thus, coupling run, remains free parameter. related problem qcd scale set temperature instead dimensional transmutation. glueball mass scale roughly temperature , string tension, free parameter, g2n 2. qcd theory scale set dimensional transmutation, one expects glueball mass scale directly related string scale. thus seek another gravity dual better describe qcd. one candidate type 0 model proposed klebanov tseytlin {$9802109$}. ironically, model considered toy model rst developed {$9802109$}. following original suggestion polyakov {$9711200$}, klebanov tseytlin argued one could construct dual su (n ) gauge 1 theory 6 real adjoint scalars stacking n electric d3 branes type 0 model top other. type 0 model closed string tachyon lives bulk, open string tachyon lives branes. closed string tachyon couples form eld strength, drives tachyon nonzero expectation value. {$9802109$} shown using equations motion derived {$9802109$} eective coupling two heavy quarks desired logarithmic fall uv gy 2 1 log , (1.1) energy scale. possible ir solution given {$9802109$}, closer inspection, one nds generic tachyon potentials, uv solution connect particular ir solution. {$9802109$} dierent ir solution given corresponds ir xed point innite coupling connement. given class tachyon potentials, xed point could conceivably connect uv point {$9802109$}. rst glance, presence ir xed point seems sensible since, shown {$9802109$}, two loop contribution -function positive. hence one might expect banks-zaks xed point {$9802150$}. presumably, quantum corrections push value xed point innite coupling. hand, one could argue quantum corrections lift masses adjoint scalars. hence theory behave much like pure su (n ) gauge theory, extra massive states. using reasoning, one expect type 0 theory conne. fact, using modest assumptions tachyon potentials, show classical dual gravity equations motion generic solutions ir exhibit i) linear quark-antiquark potential ii) magnetic screening iii) discrete glueball spectrum. glueball mass scale related string scale /n 1/4, dependence free parameter. one assumes tachyon reaches xed value ir, exists ir solutions curvature diverges, many, all, corrections fall exponentially. section 2 review type 0 model discuss uv solution running coupling constant. assume tachyon potentials satisfy minimum number properties, otherwise generic. section 3 discuss various ir solutions. argue order reach ir solutions discussed previously literature requires plenty ne tuning, even then, guaranteed uv solution section 2 match solutions. discuss generic class ir solutions argue 2 uv solution adjustable enough match range ir solutions. section 4 examine validity solutions beyond classical limit, general nd string corrections swamp leading order term. however, nd solutions many corrections exponentially suppressed. ir solutions approach conformal transformation product space r+ m4 s5, tachyon owing constant value. leads us speculate exact solution full -model whose asymptotic behavior matches asymptotic behavior classical solutions. section 5 discuss physical implications generic ir solutions section 3. given one inequality, satised special solutions found section 4, argue two heavy quarks linear potential large distances. argue magnetic screening discrete spectrum. also calculate glueball mass ratios using wkb method. results dier somewhat nite temperature results errors larger due complexity equations. low lying masses make reasonable estimates lower bounds mass ratios consistent lattice computations. section 6 present conclusions. 2. type 0 nonsupersymmetric model. type 0 model {$9802109$} closed string tachyon,

(3.16) (3.17) f (t0) > f (t0)/4, case function (2.4), write oscillatory solution amplitude phase shift. hence, naively anyway, appear enough integration constants match solutions. matching particular ir solution still requires tremendous amount ne tuning. f (t0) f (t0)/4 would positive real would still two integration constants adjust. behavior would also x problem instabilities due negative tachyon mass near uv xed point. point, space locally ads5 condition stability tachyon mass satisfy m2 4 {$9802150$}. precisely condition f (t0) f (t0)/4. condition satised uv xed point tachyon would couple relevant operator. generic case relaxes zero constant tir variables asymptotic behavior (3.13). case, tir falls exponentially . see equations motion second derivative starts positive, becomes negative point = 0. hence, possible nd solution starts upward relaxes nite point, elds grow linearly . finally, let us consider g(t0) > 0. ows away = 0 appear possible ir solutions except (3.13) > 0 (3.15) 3 < 0. 4. possible validity class infrared solutions order trust solutions asymptotic behavior (3.13) (3.15), necessary check higher corrections small. rst glance, would appear miserable failure. curvature einstein metric ds2 e = e/2ds2, ds2 metric (2.1), approaches r (cid:18) 1 2 1 2 52 2(cid:19) e(521/2). 13 (4.1) blows constraint (3.16). leading string corrections form 3e3/2w , w combination four contracted riemann tensors. hence naive dependence 3 terms using solutions (3.13) e3/2w e(2022130/2).
