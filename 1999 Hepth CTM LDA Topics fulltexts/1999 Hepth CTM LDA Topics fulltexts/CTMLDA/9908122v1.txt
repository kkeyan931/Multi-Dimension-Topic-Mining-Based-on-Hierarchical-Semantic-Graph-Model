f-theories with reduced monodromy

and

eective string theories

abstract

we discuss aspects of the non-standard version of f-theory based on the arithmetic of
torsion points on elliptic curves. we construct new f-theory vacua in 8-dimensions. they
are coming by the projective realizations of f-theory on k3 surfaces admitting double covers
onto p 2, branched along a plane sextic curve, the so called double sextics. the new vacua
are associated with singular k3 surfaces. in this way the stable picture of the heterotic string
is mapped at the triple ponts of the sextic. we argue that this formulation incorporates
naturally the sp(4, z) invariance that the extrapolating four dimensional vector multiplet
sector of all heterotic vacua may possess. in addition, we describe the way that the 4d
genus two description of (0,2) moduli dependece of n = 1 gauge coupling constants may
be connected to riemann surfaces, with natural sp(4, z) duality invariance. here, we
recover a novel way to break space-time supersymmetry and x the moduli parameters
in the presence of the wilson lines. we also consider a novel way to break space-time
supersymmetry and x the moduli parameters in the presence of the wilson lines. we also
consider the heterotic duals to compactications of f-theory to four dimensions belonging
to isomorphic classes of eliptic curves with point cusps of order two. for the latter theories
we calculate the n = 2 4d heterotic prepotential corresponding to o(2)t o(2)u classical
perturbative duality group and their conjugate modular theories.

introduction

higher dimensional theories like f-theory dont have any obvious manifestation in twelve di-
mensions as one should expect. instead f-theory makes its presence manifest only through
its compactications to lower dimensions that match already known compactications of
the heterotic string ( or its equivalent theories iia, iib, etc). in turn n = 2 4d compacti-
cations of the heterotic string, an obvious candidate for f-theory compactication match
have a n = 2 vector multiple sector dened by a kahler potential

k =  log(i

 ) =  log(i x ifi  ix i fi), i = 0, . . . , n

where  = (x i(m i ), fi(x i)) the holomorphic symplectic period vector, and x i the spe-
cial coordinates. demanding complete gauge xing, in perturbation theory, of the vector
multiplet sector of the four dimensional n = 2 compactications of the heterotic string
requires the knowledge of the holomorphic prepotential f . that has been calculated in
[1, 2, 3].
the full target space duality transformations act on the space of the symplectic vectors ,
which includes wilson lines, in the form

k =  log[(t + t )(u + u)  (b + c)( b + c)]

an obvious challenge, for f-theory, that is matching the existing heterotic compacti-

cations, may be directly related to the arithmetic of torsion points on elliptic curves.
in this work, we will give evidence for the presence of new 8-dimensional f-theory realiza-
tions [5].

double covers

it is known that f-theory compactied on a k3 surface realized as an elliptic bration with
a section is on the same moduli space, namely

o(2,18)(2, 18)/(o(2)  o(18))

the perturbative heterotic string on a t 2 torus. schematically,

(5)

on the right hand side of this equivalence the torus can be represented as an elliptic curve,

y2 = x3 + ax + b,

(6)

that is the double cover of the complex plane x. however, on the left hand side of (5)
the k3 surface sf building the compactication of f-theory is represented as an elliptic
bration over a p 1 base, namely as the map  : sf  p 1. comparison of the two sides in
(5),reveals the lack of the presence of a double cover on the f-theory side. this constitutes
a form of violation of double cover parity signalling dierent treatment of the bases
of the f-theory/heterotic duality pairs. by demanding that f-theory respects the double
cover treatment of its base we may generate new f-theories. the double cover parity
may disappear only when we consider generating surfaces from double covers onto p 2.
double covers of k3 onto p 2, the so-called double sextics are branched along a plane
sextic curve. in general a curve x which is a double cover of y branched along a curve c,
is one to one correspondence with singular k3 surfaces e.g maximal picard number equal
to twenty. every singular surface is the double cover of a k3 surface. for example, at the
limit that the t 2 is large the k3 surface degenerates into a variety that is made from the
union of two intersecting rational elliptic surfaces s1, s2 intersecting along an elliptic curve
e.

table 1

all the possible forms of the rational elliptic surface as an elliptic bration against its
double cover and the order of the mordell-weyl (mw)group are listed in table 1. the
rst column gives us the the kodaira bers appearing in the cubic associated with the
corresponding mordell-weyl group order of the group of sections given in the second col-
umn. the third column is the conguration of allowed kodaira bers for the associated
k3 brations.

the double cover consists of an elliptic bration  : y  p 1 and an involution that

respects the bration . in this case the bration always have xed points.
the form of the rational elliptic bration is directly connected to the order of mw that
denes a group operation over the rational points q of the elliptic curve. its action restricts
the form of the associated weierstrass bration and cam be written as e(q)  z r  ,
where r is the rank of e(q) and  the torsion subgroup. so for example for the

  = z2  z2,

y2 = x(x  )(x  ),

(7)

while for the

  = z4  z2,

y2 = x(z +  2)(x + 2),  =  2,  = 2.

eective string theories from double covers

on the previous section we demanded that the base space of the 8-dimensional f-
theory/ heterotic duality pair must be treated in terms of double covers. the question that
remains now is that if we can nd an eective theory that can be formulated in terms of
double covers and is dened in lower dimensions , e.g four, that may be dened both in
the f-theory and the heterotic side. the case of the heterotic string is considered in this
section while the n = 2 four dimensional compactication of f-theory counterpart will be
treated in a future work.

the hyperelliptic curve for a genus 2g+2 resp. 2 surface is given by

y2 = 2g+2

i=1 (x  ei) = p2g+2(x, ei), ei

6= ej, f or i 6= j,

(9)

and represents the double cover of the sphere branched over 2g+2 resp. 2 points. the map
from the jacobian to the complex numbers denes the  functions with the usual build
sp(2g, 2) invariance. so in g = 2 the invariance is sp(4, z) the required t-duality of the
perturbative heterotic string spectrum. in order to dene the genus 2 hyperelliptic curve

as the riemann surface that the (0,2) 4d heterotic string lives we need one more element.
the element that we require is that there is a birational correspondence [4] between the
projective varieties associated with the graded ring of even projective invariants of binary
sextics and with the graded ring of modular forms.
in simple terms that means that
the projective variety linked with the graded ring of even projective invariants of binary
sextics is a compactication of moduli of genus two. therefore if we denote the six roots
i, i = 1, . . . , 6 of the sextic sox 6 + s1x 5 + . . . + s6 and we denote their dierence by
(i  j) the invariants a, b, c, d take the following form

a(s) = s2

b(s) = s4

o i<j(jk)2.

d(s) = s10

because a sextic can be brought into the general form

x(x  1)(x  1)(x  2)(x  3)

(11)

we can replace each of the three lambda in (11) by some theta function of zero argument,

theta functions of genus two. it can be proved that 1, 2, 3 can be expanded in terms of
even powers of  when  is small. as a result all the variables in (11) are xed and its roots
may be calculated. moreover the invariants a, b, c, d, are expressed in terms of  and .

(17)

that means that the uniformation parameters of the sextic (11) are xed genus two elements
therefore possessing manifest sp(4, z) invariance. in its non-perturbative form the equation
for the sextic p6 involves the parametric relation (17). notice that in (16) the fundamental
invariant of the full theory are expressed in terms of products of j-invariants. what we have
not discuss is the expansion of genus two theta functions in terms of epsilon parameter,
that coincide with the wilson line background elds, represents exactly the fact that the
space of projective varieties corresponding to the invariants a, b, c, d has been blown
up such that the jacobian variery of the genus two curve has degenerate to a product of
elliptic curves. the blow up process is necessary since the projective variety p6 does not
apriori include the siegel fundamental domain. the correspondence with the heterotic
string comes after identifying t = 1, u = 2,  =wilson line.
at the points that the discriminant of the projective variety of p6 degenerates both t, u
and the wilson line are involved in a non-trivial relation. that means that one or more
moduli may be xed therefore breaking space-time supersymmetry.

at this point we might be tempted to give a description of the n = 2 vector multiplet
eective theory in the case that eective heterotic theory comes with target space duality
group o(2)t  o(2)u . the one loop perturbative heterotic prepotential can be calculated
in this case [5].

conclusions

in the previous sections we introduced a new constraint, that the f-theory/heterotic duality
may satisfy in order to correctly reproduce the target space duality transformations of the
heterotic string. that involves the treatment of the base in both pairs in terms of double
covers.
particular role in our study is layed by the mw group. its presence generates new solutions
for the stable degeneration limit of the f-theory k3 surface.
at the moment our study is conned on the equivalence of the f-theory/heterotic string
at 8-dimensions in terms of double covers. the relevance of our results for the n = 2 4d
theory comes only through the determination of the riemann surface that is a double cover

of the sphere. in order for our results to be relevant to the f-theory/heterotic duality in
four dimensions we must nd the f-theory compactication realized on a four dimensional
context. work is in progress towards this goal.
