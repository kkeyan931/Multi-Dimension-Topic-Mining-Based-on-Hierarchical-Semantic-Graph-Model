the thermodynamics of supersymmetric yang-mills theories is studied by computing the

two-loop correction to the canonical free energy and to the equation of state for theories

with 16, 8 and 4 supercharges in any dimension 4  d  10, and in two dimensions at nite

volume. in the four-dimensional case we also evaluate the rst non-analytic contribution

in the t hooft coupling to the free energy, arising from the resummation of ring diagrams.

to conclude, we discuss some applications to the study of the hagedorn transition in string

theory in the context of matrix strings and speculate on the possible physical meaning of

the transition.

1. introduction

the study of the thermal properties of supersymmetric yang-mills (sym) and super-

string theories has received a boost [1][2][3][4][5][6] after the d-brane revolution [7]. more

recently, the conjecture by maldacena of a duality between string theory on anti-de sitter

(ads) backgrounds and the large-n limit of sym theories [8][9] has further motivated the

study of these issues in the hope that it could lead to a clarication of the mechanisms of

connement in non-abelian gauge theories [10].

beyond its purely cosmological/phenomenological relevance, the study of sym ther-

modynamics nds interesting applications in the study of near-extremal black holes [11]

and d-branes [12][13]. when looking at the eective theory of coincident d-branes there

are, generically, two regimes associated with the values of the eective gauge couplings

gsq (q being the number of coincident d-branes or the charges of the black hole). when

gsq < 1 the eld theory limit is well described by a perturbative sym theory living on

the world-volume of the d-brane. on the other hand, taking gsq > 1 the weakly coupled

d-brane picture is not appropriate any more. using maldacenas conjecture, however, it is

possible to relate the eld theory limit in this non-perturbative regime (large t hooft cou-

pling) with a supergravity computation on some background of the form adsd (spheres).
corrections to the leading strong coupling result of order o(1/gsq) are then associated
with higher dimensional terms ( corrections) in the supergravity eective action.

the study of the corrections to the leading results on both sides (weak [14] and strong

[15][16] coupling) has been done for the conformal n = 4 sym theory in d = 4 and a

tendency in both curves to meet was detected (see however [17]).

in this note we will

try to achieve a twofold objective. first, to compute the two-loop free energy of sym

theories with 16, 8 and 4 supercharges in various dimensions. the rst class of theories

are specially interesting because of their potential application to non-conformal versions of

the maldacena conjecture [9]. second, to obtain the rst non-analytic correction in the t
hooft coupling, of order o[(gy m n )3/2], to the two-loop result in four dimensional theories
arising from the resummation of ring diagrams. we will analyze also with some detail

the two-dimensional case, where the infrared divergences will be handled by putting the

system at nite volume.

the physics of the high temperature string gas has been a recurrent issue in string

theory (for a sample of papers from the golden age of thermal strings see [18][19]). in

1

recent years we have gained interesting insights about the physical meaning of the hagedorn

divergence, in spite of the fact that a full and detailed understanding of the problem seems

to be still at large. although this will not be the main subject of this note, we will try to

discuss some aspects of the hagedorn transition that could be enlightened by our results

on sym thermodynamics.

in particular we will use our study of the two-dimensional

sym theories to try to get some qualitative information about the hagedorn transition

using matrix strings as a non-perturbative denition of type-iia superstrings. in spite of

being non-conclusive, we hope the discussion to be helpful in shedding some light to such

a confusing issue.

the present paper is organized as follows: in the next section, the two-loop corrections

to the thermal free energy of sym theories with 16, 8 and 4 supercharges will be computed

in any dimension 4  d  10 using dimensional reduction from the corresponding maximal

n = 1 sym theory. in section 2.3 we compute the next correction to the two-loop free

energy for sym theories in four dimensions. section 2.4 will be devoted to the study

of the two-dimensional case at nite volume. finally, in section 3 we will summarize

the conclusions and discuss some possible application of our results to the study of the

hagedorn transition in matrix string theory.

2. two-loop free energy of sym theories

2.1. supersymmetric yang-mills theories in various dimensions

in this section we will compute the next-to-leading contribution to the canonical free

energy of supersymmetric yang-mills theories with 16, 8 and 4 supercharges. in order to

keep the analysis general, we will start with n = 1 sym in d dimensions, whose dynamics

is governed by the action [20]

s =z ddx tr(cid:20)

1
4g2

y m

fabf ab + i ada(cid:21)

where a, b = 0, . . . , d  1 and both the gauge elds and spinors are in the adjoint repre-

sentation of u (n ). we get theories with dierent number of supercharges by choosing the
appropriate value of d for which that number #sc is maximal:

#sc = 16  dmax = 10

#sc = 8  dmax = 6

#sc = 4  dmax = 4.

2

in addition, dierent conditions on fermions have to be imposed in order to keep the number

of bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom equal. thus, when dmax = 10 fermions have to

be taken majorana-weyl, while for dmax = 6 and dmax = 4 they satisfy weyl conditions

(actually in d = 4 we can choose the fermions to be either majorana or weyl, both

conditions being equivalent [20]). this ensures that the number of physical bosonic and

fermionic degrees of freedom will be equal to dmax  2.

in general, however, we will be interested in sym theories with #sc supercharges

in dimensions d  dmax. this theories can be obtained by dimensional reduction of the

corresponding maximal n = 1 sym theory in d = dmax [20]. thus, we can parameterize

any d-dimensional sym theory with any number of supercharges by specifying both d and

the maximal dimension dmax from which it is obtained by dimensional reduction. in this

way, starting with dmax = 10 (n = 1 in d = 10) we get n = 1 in d = 8, n = 2 in d = 6,

n = 4 in d = 4 and n = 8 in d = 2. starting instead with dmax = 6 (n = 1 in d = 6) we

will have n = 2 in d = 4 and n = 4 in d = 2. finally, if we take dmax = 4 we can retrieve

n = 2 in d = 2. (for odd dimensions 2n  1 we have the n corresponding to dimension

2n).

2.2. two-loop free energy for d  4

with this in mind, we can proceed to compute the canonical free energy in pertur-

bation theory for any supersymmetric yang-mills theory characterized by (dmax, d), by

writing down the contribution of vacuum feynman diagrams of n = 1 in d = dmax sym

and restricting internal momentum in loops to d dimensions. that way we are able to

keep track of the contribution of gauge bosons and scalars (as well as their supersymmet-

ric partners) without having to consider a larger number of diagrams2. the nal result,

of course, will depend on (d, dmax).

as a warmup exercise, we will compute the one-loop free energy density.

in the

maximal n = 1 theory we have three diagrams, a bosonic loop, a fermionic loop and the

2 for example, using this trick one can get the result of ref. [14] by computing, instead of ten,

only four two-loop feynman diagrams.

where by (p ) and {p } we represent, respectively, bosonic (periodic) and fermionic (anti-
periodic) boundary conditions along the euclidean time and the factor of n 2 is due to
the fact that all elds are in the adjoint representation of u (n ). after a straightforward

next we get the two-loop corrections to this result. thus, we must sum the contribu-
tions of the four feynman diagrams of fig. 1. corresponding to n = 1 sym in d = dmax
where internal momenta is restricted to a d-dimensional space-time (one of whose direc-

tions is the compactied euclidean time). proceeding this way and after some algebra we

the rst thing to be said about eq. (2.2) is that the zero temperature (ultraviolet

divergent) contribution cancels out between the bosonic and the fermionic integral. this

is just a consequence of supersymmetry since the vacuum energy should not be corrected

at zero temperature if supersymmetry is to be preserved by the vacuum [22]. this is the

reason why this cancellation occurs not only for the conformal n = 4, sym4 (dmax = 10)

[14], but for all sym theories under study.

notice that although all sym theories in dimension higher than 4 are non-

renormalizable, the two-loop nite temperature free energy is well behaved in the ultravi-

olet. this is a consequence of the fact that the ultraviolet region in the thermal integrals

is eectively cut-o for momenta p  t and therefore the temperature dependent part of

the amplitudes is, to a great extent, insensitive to ultraviolet ambiguities. of course, di-

vergences should have been taken care of in the zero temperature sector by an appropriate

cut-o in momenta  (although some protected observables, like the vacuum energy, will

be nite due to supersymmetry). in that case, consistency will require t < .

to get an analytical expression for the free energy we can evaluate the integrals ap-

pearing in (2.3) for generic values of the dimension3

(2.4)

incidentally, the two-loop correction to the free energy is always positive for d > 1, so it

always tends to increase the (negative) one-loop contribution.

from (2.4) we see explicitly how corrections to the one-loop result come in powers of
the t hooft coupling g2
y m n which is kept xed in the large-n limit. since in d-dimensions
y m has dimension of (energy)4d the condition for
the yang-mills coupling constant g2
the perturbative expansion to be reliable is the eective dimensionless coupling at a given

temperature to be small

notice that for d > 4, for which the sym theory is non-renormalizable, perturbative

corrections to the free energy will be governed by a small parameter in the low temperature

limit, corresponding to the fact that the theory is well behaved in the infrared. actually,

higher order corrections to formula (2.4) have better and better infrared behavior as we

increase the order in perturbation theory. at the same time the ultraviolet divergences

worsen in the zero temperature sector, while in the temperature-dependent part of the

amplitude the ultraviolet behavior is smoother due to the presence of boltzmann factors
that eectively cut-o momenta beyond a scale of order4 t .

from the two-loop canonical free energy we can obtain the corrections to the equation
of state of symd. we rst compute the canonical entropy density s(t ) as a function of
the temperature and invert it up to terms of order o[(gy m n )2] to get

4 the better ultraviolet behavior of the temperature-dependent sector of the theory does not
guarantee its niteness in higher loops; for example, the free energy in sym10 is ultraviolet

contains a f 4 term that scales quadratically with the ultraviolet cut-o. the resulting thermal

order o[(g2

generically, the next contribution to (2.4) is naively given by three-loop diagrams of
y m n )2]. however in four dimensions, as it happens in qcd [24][21], at three
loop level there are already uncanceled infrared divergences that have to be cured by sum-
ming over ring diagrams. this gives a non-analytic (of order o[(g2
y m n )3/2]) contribution
to the free energy, representing a mild failure of perturbation theory due to the infrared
ambiguities. the evaluation of this term is essentially equivalent to dressing the aa
0 and
scalar propagators in loops by introducing the eect of debye screening and thermal mass

for the scalars. to leading order in the t hooft coupling, the electric (debye) mass can be

easily computed from the static limit of the one-loop self-energy to give

in order to get the o[(g2

where i are the ns = dmax  4 adjoint scalars in the theory and the electric mass only
aects to the zero-frequency component of the aa
0 eld (cf. [24]). the strategy now is to
treat the last two terms as a perturbation to the lagrangian density between brackets. this

results in a reorganization of perturbation theory in which the ring-diagram contribution

can be easily evaluated.

the rst thing will be to compute again the one-loop free energy density, including

now the eect of the masses in the lagrangian (2.8) and, at the same time, adding new

one-loop diagrams containing vertices associated with the counterterms. expanding the
results up to order o[(g2

where the values of the thermal masses are given by eqs. (2.6) and (2.7). it is important

to notice that this term is always negative for all 4  dmax  10.

5 the trick of dimensional reduction is no longer useful here because the thermal mass dis-
tinguishes between scalar and gauge boson propagators. thus we have to compute all diagrams

separately.

9

the only thing left now will be to add (2.10) to the two-loop result (2.5). in particular,

doing so for the superconformal n = 4, sym4 and evaluating the numerical coecients,
we nd (2  g2

y m n )

f ()n =4 = n 2t 4[1.645  0.2502 + 0.2343 + o(4)].

next terms in the perturbative expansion in four dimensions will be of order o(4) and
o(4 log ) and can be also evaluated using the strategy employed in [21] (or up to order
o(5) using [25][26]). however, nite temperature perturbation theory is expected to break
down at order o[(g2
y m n )3] [27]. since this failure of perturbation theory is associated with
the infrared sector of the theory, supersymmetry is not expected to solve the problem or

even improve the situation. as in qcd [28][26], some kind of non-perturbative analysis

will be needed in order to compute higher orders. actually, the general structure of the

series in  is important in trying to decide whether there is a phase transition occurring

at some intermediate value of the t hooft coupling that precludes the extrapolation of

supergravity physics into the gauge theory domain [17].

2.4. sym2 thermodynamics on s1

l  r

when d  3 the analysis of the quantum corrections to the one loop free energy gets ad-

ditional complications due to the hard infrared divergences that aict super-renormalizable

theories. for d = 3, we see that expression (2.4) diverges because of a (1) factor. in prin-

ciple this can be cured, as usual, by computing the thermal masses and inserting them into

the propagators, thus regularizing the low-momentum behavior of the feynman integrals.

however, in the three-dimensional case the computation of the electric mass has to be done

with extra care, since the one-loop corrections to the propagators are already infrared di-

vergent. thus, the electric mass has to be evaluated self-consistently `a la hartree-fock

[29]. anyway, we will not dwell in this case any further.

the two-dimensional case, on the other hand, is more interesting from several points

of view. the one that will concern us here is that n = 8, sym2 describes the world-

volume dynamics of matrix strings [30], a non-perturbative denition of type-iia super-

strings. naively, (2.4) is ill-dened for d = 2 due to the endemic infrared divergences of

low-dimensional eld theories. there are several ways in which this divergence can be

10

regularized. here we will get rid of the problem by putting the system in nite box6 of

length l = 2r. we will assume that the thermal wavelengths of the fundamental elds

are much smaller than the global length of the box   l and restrict our analysis to the

sector without wilson lines (the long strings that characterize the matrix string phase).

once this is done, the only change in the computation of feynman diagrams is that con-

tinuous space momentum is discretized in units of 1/r and the momentum integrals have

to be replaced by discrete sums

(2.11)

where the second sum is, as usual, over integer or half-integer matsubara frequencies

depending on the bosonic or fermionic character of the propagating eld.

in the one-loop approximation the relevant bosonic and fermionic determinants have

been already computed in [31] and the resulting one-loop free energy density can be cast

in terms of modular functions

in computing the bosonic determinant, and in order to keep the argument of the logarithm

dimensionless, we have added a -independent counterterm. in the innite volume limit

let us now go to the two-loop case. to compute the contribution to the free en-

ergy density we can use formula (2.2) provided we substitute the integration by the sum

according to (2.11). after making so, we nd

reliable in dealing with infrared divergences we will not follow this procedure.

11

resulting regular zeta-function arises as the dierence of two singular zeta-functions with

(1)-like divergences which cancel out. this is again due to the non-renormalization of the

vacuum energy for supersymmetric theories.

actually, the zeta-function in (2.12) can be written itself in terms of ordinary modular

functions (see rst article in [32]), so at the end we can write

3. conclusions and outlook: hagedorn transition from sym thermodynamics?

in the present paper, the thermodynamics of supersymmetric yang-mills theories with

16, 8 and 4 supercharges was studied in any dimension d  4. we computed the two-loop

correction to the free energy for these theories and found that it always has opposite sign

to the leading (negative) one-loop result. in the four-dimensional case we also evaluated

the correction to the free energy arising from the resummation of the ring diagrams, using

12

the technique of ref. [21], and found it to be negative. for lower dimensional (d  3) sym

theories, the computation is plagued with infrared divergences that have to be regularized

somehow. we studied in detail the two-dimensional case at nite volume (to regularize

these infrared divergences) in the high temperature limit. again we found a positive
two-loop correction which scales as t 2 with an eective dimensionless coupling given by
g2
y m n l2.

before closing, let us make some remarks on the potential use of sym thermodynam-

ics in clarifying the issue of the hagedorn transition. on general grounds, one can expect

two possible resolutions to the hagedorn problem: either non-perturbative eects drive

the critical temperature to a maximum reachable temperature for the system or new fun-

damental degrees of freedom appear at high energies, thus providing a picture for a phase

transition (or a smooth crossover, depending on the details of the dynamics). although at

present there are no clear evidences as to which one of the two alternatives is physically

realized in string/m-theory, some results [3][5] and our still incomplete knowledge of the

theory seem to hint in the direction of the second one.

d-instanton corrections to the thermodynamical potentials have been studied in [2]

with the result that they do not modify the critical behavior at the hagedorn temperature.

more recently, the authors of refs. [5] have included non-perturbative semiclassical ingredi-

ents in the analysis of the physics of the hagedorn transition at nite volume through the

horowitz-polchinski correspondence principle [33], getting a picture in which the hagedorn

phase is bounded at high energies by a black hole phase. a similar situation occurs for a

string gas on ads backgrounds where, in the canonical ensemble, the hagedorn transition

is screened by the formation of an ads black hole [4].

a second approach to the problem would start with a non-perturbative formulation

of string theory in terms of m-theoretic degrees of freedom, as it has been proposed in

[3]. let us momentarily adhere ourselves to this latter path and, starting with the non-

perturbative denition of the type-iia superstring provided by matrix strings [30], study

the world-volume thermodynamics of type-iia strings in the microcanonical ensemble.

the world-volume theory is governed by n = 8 sym2 with the yang-mills coupling
s), with gs the string coupling constant. on the other
constant given by g2
in the infrared,

hand, free eld congurations are determined by the overall scale 

y m = 1/(g2



.

e  gy m , the physics is dominated by long string excitations along the at directions.
it is in this regime in which matrix strings reproduce, in the large-n limit, the multi-string

13

type-iia ensemble [30][6]. if the energy is increased, the system will begin to be excited

along non-at directions as well. at energies e  gy m the potential terms in the n = 8
sym2 theory will behave as a small perturbation and the system will enter a perturbative
regime. thermodynamics there is well dened, as we have seen from the previous analysis.

it is tempting to try to make some connection between these two world-sheet regimes

and the low/high energy regimes in the target space string theory. at low energies we

have perturbative type-iia superstring theory that, in ten open space-time dimensions,

we know is characterized at high energies by a negative specic heat phase. this nega-

tive specic heat phase is viewed as a breakdown of equipartition in energy, in the sense

that most of the energy of the string ensemble is stored into one (or a small number) of

highly excited strings [18][19]. from the philosophy of m-theory it seems quite reason-

able to expect that if too much energy is stored into a single string some transition to

non-perturbative (maybe eleven-dimensional) physics should take place, putting an end to

the negative specic phase. alternatively, a black hole could be formed before the system

leaves the string regime [5]. in any case, the nal conclusion would be that the hagedorn

phase will be bounded by a new phase into which the system will decay either via a smooth

crossover or a phase transition.

in the case at hand, however, it is not clear how to connect the world-volume theory

with some kind of target picture. one of the diculties lies in the fact that matrix strings

are formulated in the light-cone gauge, in which the space-time interpretation is rather

obscure. nonetheless, one can naively argue that the negative specic heat phase at inter-
s 1/2 by a
mediate energies 1/2 < e  g1
new phase with regular thermodynamics (i.e. positive specic heat) eectively described

s 1/2 is bounded at high energy e  g1

by a perturbative two-dimensional u (n ) supersymetric yang-mills theory with sixteen

supercharges in the large-n limit. if this were so, the transition between the low energy

string phase and the new high energy phase would be through a rst order phase transition

across the unstable (negative specic heat) phase (cf. carlitz in [18]). the critical points

would be determined by the maxwell rule for the entropy, provided the complete prole of

the microcanonical temperature t (e) is known.

the space-time interpretation of such a phase is far from being straightforward. in
s )1  0) the
the sym2 perturbative regime (or directly in the free limit g2
two-dimensional action is that of sigma-model in a non-commutative target space with
matrix coordinates x   adj[u (n )]. whether this indicates that the hagedorn transition

y m  (g2

14

corresponds7 to the nucleation of non-commutative bubbles in a commutative space-time

is something that it is dicult to decide with our present knowledge of the theory. one of

the problems to be claried will be, for example, how the target space volume dependence

of the extensive quantities emerges as a function of n . in any case, we stress that this

extrapolation of the world-sheet picture to space-time physics is very speculative, and

should be tested by a detailed computation. we hope to report on this elsewhere.

in a sense, this picture can be regarded as dual to the one proposed in [3]. there,

the hagedorn transition is linked to the condensation of d0-branes and their low-energy

dynamics will be u (n ) super quantum mechanics with sixteen supercharges. both descrip-

tions could in principle be related by performing a t-duality along the ninth dimension

and interchanging its role with the m-theory circle.

which overlaps with the results presented here and that has later appeared in [34]. i would

like also to thank a. nieto and a. tseytlin for their interesting remarks on the rst version

of the article.

7 at least in those cases in which it is not preceded by the formation of black holes due to the
corresponding principle. actually, we can tune the string coupling constant gs, the volume and

the total energy in such a way that the system avoid the correspondence line and thus we prevent

the formation of black holes.
