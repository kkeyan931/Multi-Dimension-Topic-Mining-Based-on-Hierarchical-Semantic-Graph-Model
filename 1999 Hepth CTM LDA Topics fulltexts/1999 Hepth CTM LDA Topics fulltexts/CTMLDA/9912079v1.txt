abstract

we study conformal eld theory correlation functions relevant for string dia-
grams with open strings that stretch between several parallel branes of dierent
dimensions. in the framework of conformal eld theory, they involve boundary
condition changing twist elds which intertwine between neumann and dirichlet
conditions. a knizhnik-zamolodchikov-like dierential equation for correlators
of such boundary twist elds and ordinary string vertex operators is derived, and
explicit integral formulas for its solutions are provided.

1. introduction

d-branes [25] have become the most important ingredient of the new picture of string
theory that has emerged in recent years. they have shaped a new understanding of non-
perturbative eects in string theory and of low-energy eective theories associated with
string theories. in the latter context, systems of many branes are of particular importance,
since they provide a natural way to include non-abelian gauge theories into string theory
[35]. systems of several branes of dierent dimensions, most notably of d1- and d5-branes,
play a major role in proposals of how to derive the bekenstein-hawking entropy of black
holes from string theory [34,22]. more recently, stacks of branes and anti-branes have been
reconsidered in connection with a k-theoretic classication of branes [36], based on results
concerning tachyon condensation in [32].
some qualitative features of such systems can be uncovered within a target space approach.
but e.g. the process of brane-antibrane annihilation in the last-mentioned application, or
the properties of near-extremal black holes involve the analysis of non-bps states for
which the world-sheet approach is better suited, since it does not critically depend on
supersymmetry. computation of cft correlation functions is indispensable if one wants
to deal with problems like hawking radiation o d1-d5-systems, or for a clean discussion
of bound state formation [18].

the world-sheet formulation of string sectors with branes is well known in string theory,
although mainly in connection with at targets. the general setup involves boundary
conformal eld theory as introduced and developed by cardy [7,8,9] and rst exploited for
string theory by sagnotti [29]. cft on surfaces with boundaries exhibits a very interesting
internal structure and nds interesting applications beyond string theory: for many s-wave
dominated scattering processes, the universal behaviour is described by a boundary cft
in two dimensions, irrespective of the dimensionality of the original system. the most
famous problem that could be tackled with boundary cft methods is the kondo eect in
condensed matter physics [1].
in string theory, methods of boundary cft are not only valuable in the study of situations
without the bps-property, but also to uncover non-classical features like unexpected mod-
uli [32,28] and non-commutative geometry; see e.g. [13,30,31,3,14] and references therein.
moreover, they allow one to analyze d-branes in non-geometric string compactications
such as gepner models [24,33,27,19,5,11].

in this paper, we ask how to compute cft correlators describing string amplitudes of
arbitrary closed and open string vertex operators in the presence of multiple at branes
in rd. the open strings involved stretch between two or more dierent branes, which
may have dierent dimensions. it appears that no systematic method for the computation
of those string diagrams, which contribute to scattering processes in higher orders of the
string coupling constant, is available in the literature. see, however, [20] for some sample
computations of scattering amplitudes in the presence of a pair of branes.

the world-sheet description requires surfaces with several boundary components. we
restrict our attention to diagrams without internal closed string loops so that we can
map the world-sheet to the disk or to the upper half-plane, but with dierent boundary
conditions assigned to consecutive intervals on the boundary; see figure 1. we focus on
parallel branes here; thus we can reduce our analysis to a one-dimensional target. results

1

for rd with d > 1 follow by taking tensor products. the boundary state for a p-brane
involves p + 1 neumann and d  p  1 dirichlet boundary states of single free bosons.
the interesting transitions between boundary conditions in a one-dimensional target are
those from neumann to dirichlet or vice versa. they are mediated by boundary elds of
a special type, namely boundary condition changing twist elds.

figure 1: the upper half-plane with a sequence of neumann (solid intervals)
and dirichlet (dashed intervals) boundary conditions along the real line. the dots
between neumann and dirichlet intervals mark insertions of boundary condition
changing twist elds, while crosses on the boundary or in the interior refer to
insertions of ordinary open resp. closed string vertex operators. such a world-
sheet diagram can be understood as hawking radiation (closed string states) from
a system of branes (multiple changes of boundary conditions) with simultaneous
inner excitations (open string states).

conformal boundary conditions which preserve the chiral algebra w of the theory are
parametrized by certain automorphisms  of w, together with the amplitudes of one-
point functions [27]. if w is the u(1) current algebra,  can act as  id on the currents,
and the 1-point functions determine the location of a brane. if the boundary condition is
constant along the boundary, arbitrary n-point functions can be expressed in terms of the
usual conformal blocks of w; see e.g. [7,27,17].
if the gluing conditions described by an automorphism  of w remain constant along the
boundary the computation of correlation functions is not, in principle, a dicult problem.
otherwise, the simple ward identities for the symmetry algebra w are broken, and one
has to nd new methods to construct the twisted chiral blocks involving a new type of
boundary condition changing operators which correspond to twisted rather than ordinary
representations of w. it is the aim of this article to develop a convenient formalism for
computing such correlation functions in the case of a at target space.

the plan of this paper is as follows: in the next section, we look at correlation functions
which contain just one insertion of a boundary twist eld. we shall provide a complete
operator construction of the boundary cft, from which one can derive correlators with
an arbitrary number of closed string vertex operators inserted in the bulk. when there are
more than two twist elds on the boundary, such techniques are no longer available. our

2

strategy is then to derive ward identities for the correlation functions. they will lead us
to knizhnik-zamolodchikov-like dierential equations which describe the eect of moving
insertion points for bulk and boundary elds in terms of a at connection. we explain this
idea in section 3 and exploit it in the fourth section to give explicit integral formulas for the
correlators. while some of the technical steps in setting up the knizhnik-zamolodchikov
equations are rather involved, parts of our nal results can be related to electrostatics.
section 5 comments on possible generalizations and applications.

2. operator formalism for a single twist eld insertion

as a simple example, we consider open strings propagating freely in the target r, with
dirichlet boundary conditions imposed at one end of the string and neumann boundary
conditions at the other. we thus have to deal with a free bosonic eld x(t, ) dened for
space variables   [0, ] and subject to
tx(t, 0) = 0

x(t, ) = 0

,

for all t  r. mapping the strip to the upper half-plane h by z = exp(t + i), x(z, z)
satises dirichlet boundary conditions for z  r>0 and neumann boundary conditions for
z  r<0 :

x(z, z) = x0 for z = z > 0

,

(  ) x(z, z) = 0 for z = z < 0 .

(1)

our task is to compute correlation functions in this bosonic theory which involves two
insertions of twist elds on the boundary. conformal symmetry allows us to place these
boundary condition changing operators at x1 = 0 and x2 = .
we propose to construct operators x(z, z) satisfying (1), as well as open and closed string
vertex operators, and then to derive dierential equations on the correlation functions from
the algebraic properties of these operators and from the symmetries of the theory. first,
we have to determine the space our elds are to act on.

the space in question is spanned
2.1 the spectrum of boundary twist elds.
by excited states of open strings stretching between a neumann and a dirichlet boundary
condition  hence the name boundary condition changing operators for the boundary
elds uniquely associated to these states. there is a relatively simple technique to de-
termine the spectrum of boundary condition changing operators that intertwine between
two constant conformal boundary conditions b1 = (1, 1) and b2 = (2, 2) in some
boundary cft. the state space of this boundary theory is denoted by h12. because of
the state-eld correspondence, the spectrum of boundary condition changing operators is
described through the partition function of the boundary theory,

z12(q) = trh12 qh(h)

where h (h) = l0 

c
24

.

3

by an interchange of space and time coordinates (world-sheet duality), the open string
1-loop diagram underlying z12 may be viewed as a closed string tree diagram, i.e.

z12(q) = hb1| q

1

2 h(p )

|b2i where h (p ) = l(p )

0 + l0

(p ) 

c
12

,

where q = exp(2i/ ) is related to the variable q = exp(2i ) as usual. the closed
strings propagate between the boundary states |bii = |iii associated with the boundary
conditions bi. they allow to transfer boundary conditions from the upper half-plane
(where the hamiltonian is h (h)) into a cft on the full plane (with hamiltonian h (p )),
see [21,8].
the boundary states implementing dirichlet and neumann conditions along the whole
n be two commuting sets of
boundary are of course well known, see e.g. [6]. let a(p )
oscillator modes (in the plane cft) with standard commutation relations. the ground
states |ki of their fock spaces are labeled by the momentum k  r. neumann and dirichlet
boundary states are given by

n , a(p )

| n i =

a(p )
n a(p )

n(cid:9) |ki ,

(2)

where x0  r, as in (1), denotes the location of the d-brane, i.e. x|d(x0)i = x0 |d(x0)i
for the center of mass coordinate x.
if we build the boundary state |pi for a p-brane in rd as a tensor product of |ni
(p + 1 times) and |d(xi
0)i (i = p + 2, . . . , d) from eq. (2), the partition function zpp(q)
counts boundary elds that do not change the boundary condition. they describe exci-
tations of open strings attached to the p-brane. these open string vertices have the form
1...n x 1    x neikx with certain lorentz tensors 1...n and with momentum k par-
allel to the neumann directions. the case n = 1 (where the polarization  is transversal)
contains the massless modes: gauge elds living on the brane world-volume.

the partition function of the theory with neumann boundary conditions on one side and
dirichlet on the other follows from the boundary states as explained above,

znd(q) = trhnd qhnd = h n | ql0 c

(3)

orthonormality of the fock ground states implies that only the contribution from the vac-
uum sector survives in the second line. in particular, znd is independent of the parameter
x0. computation of the vacuum expectation value above is straightforward. the result
can be written as

znd(q) = q

our main conclusion concerns the conformal weights of the boundary elds that can induce
a transition between dirichlet and neumann type boundary conditions. the lowest weight
that appears is h = 1
16 . above this value, the spectrum of conformal weights has half-
integer spacings. the boundary condition changing operator with conformal weight h = 1
16
corresponding to the lowest-energy state |i in the whole sector hnd will be called (x).
we will also refer to (x) as a twist eld since the sum of irreducible virasoro characters
in (4) can alternatively be regarded as the character of a twisted u(1) representation. the
absence of a vacuum state and the half-integer energy grading are symptoms for the fact
that the jump from neumann to dirichlet destroys the simple u(1) ward identities that
are present in a boundary cft with constant neumann or dirichlet condition all along
the boundary.
it will be our main concern in the following to nd substitutes for the broken ward
identities, namely twisted knizhnik-zamolodchikov equations.

2.2 construction of the basic elds.
in order to construct a eld x(z, z) obeying the
boundary conditions (1) on h = hnd, we introduce a set of oscillator modes ar labelled by
half-integers r  z + 1
2 . (we drop the superscript (h) for operators of the upper half-plane
theory.) they are supposed to obey the relations

[ ar , as ] = r r,s

,

a
r = ar .

creation operators ar, r < 0, generate the fock space h out of the ground state |i, which
is annihilated by modes ar with index r > 0. all the elds we shall consider act on this
state space h. it is simple to verify that the decomposition x(z, z) = x(z)  x(z) of the
bosonic eld yields the desired properties if

x(z) = x0 + i xrz+ 1

2

ar
r

zr

, x(z) = i xrz+ 1

2

ar
r

zr

.

to make the square root well dened, we have to introduce a branch cut in the plane, which
extends from x = 0 to . once the bosonic eld is known, we obtain chiral currents as
ar zr1 .

ar zr1

,

j(z) := i x(z, z) = xrz+ 1

2

j(z) := i x(z, z) =  xrz+ 1

finally, the components t (z) and t (z) of the stress energy tensor are given by

t (z) = lim
wz

1

2(cid:18)j(w)j(z) 

1

(w  z)2(cid:19) ,

and likewise for t (z). since t and t are quadratic in j and j, they satisfy the usual
boundary condition t (z) = t (z) all along the real line imz = 0. by the usual arguments
[7] this implies that the modes

ln := zc+

dz
2i

zn+1 t (z) + zc

dz
2i

zn+1 t (z)

5

obey commutation relations of the virasoro algebra with central charge c = 1. here
c+  c is a closed oriented contour surrounding the origin, with c+ contained in the
upper half-plane and c contained in the lower half-plane. the commutation relation
between ln and ar is easily checked to be of the form

[ ln , ar ] = r an+r .

it is convenient to introduce two generating elds t and j by the formal sums

t(w) = xnz

ln wn2 , j(w) = xrz+ 1

2

ar wr1 .

one may think of t as being dened on the entire complex plane with t(w) = t (w) in the
upper half-plane, imw > 0, and t(w) = t (w), for all w with imw < 0. the generating eld
j naturally lives on the two-fold branched cover of the complex plane dened by 2 = w.
by introducing the branch cut from x = 0 to  we have specied a coordinate patch on
this surface with the local coordinate being denoted by w. in this chart, j(w) = j(w) for
imw > 0 and j(w) = j (w) for imw < 0.
the commutation relations for the modes ln, ar with the bosonic eld x(z, z) can be
expressed in terms of t and j as follows

[ t(w) , x(z, z) ] = x(z, z) (z  w) + x(z, z) (z  w) ,

[ j(w) , x(z, z) ] = i (z  w) + i (z  w) ,

where

(z  w) :=

1

z xnz(cid:16) z
w(cid:17)n

=

1

w(cid:17)r
2 (cid:16) z
z xrz+ 1

.

we state two simple consequences of these formulas that shall be important below. we
split j and t into two parts j(w) = j>(w) + j<(w) and t(w) = t>(w) + t<(w) such that

j>(w) := xr1/2

ar wr1

, t>(w) := xn1

ln wn2 .

in the next subsection, we will use the commutation relations between the singular parts
t>, j> of the generating elds t, j and the bosonic eld x(z, z):

[ j>(w) , x(z) ] = (cid:16) z

w(cid:17)1/2

i

w  z

,

[ t>(w) , x(z) ] =

1

w  z

zx(z) .

(5)

moreover, we will need the following lemma, a proof of which is given in appendix a.

lemma 1: one may rewrite the generating eld t(w) in terms of the objects j>(w) and
j<(w), namely

t(w) =

1

2(cid:0) j<(w)j(w) + j(w)j>(w)(cid:1) +

2.3 bulk and boundary primary elds. our next aim is to construct primary bulk
and boundary elds. here, the latter term refers to open string vertex operators which
can be inserted on r<0 or r>0 without changing the boundary condition. they are in
one-to-one correspondence to states in hdd or hnn , not to states in hnd. we will see
that bulk elds can be regarded as products of such boundary elds g(z). therefore we
discuss these chiral elds rst  admitting arbitrary complex insertion points, not just
z  h. the elds g(z) are labeled by a real parameter g and enjoy the properties

[ t(w) , g(z) ] = zg(z) (x  w) + h g(z) z(z  w) ,
[ j(w) , g(z) ] = g g(z) (z  w) .

we have used the denition of the formal -function specied above and h = 1
commutators of the t>(w), j>(w) with the elds g(x), this implies

2 g2. for the

(7)

(8)

lemma 2: the unique solution (up to normalization) g(z) to the requirements (7,8)
is given by

2(cid:19)h
g(z) = (cid:18) i

zh eigx<(z) eigx>(z)

where x>(z) = ixr>0

and x<(z) = x(z)  x>(z). note that g(z) is normal-ordered, i.e., the annihilators
ar, r > 0, appear to the right of the creation operators.

a proof can be found in appendix a.
our next aim is to describe the u(1)-primary bulk elds g(z, z). by denition, they obey
the following commutation relations with respect to j> and t>,

[ t>(w) , g(z, z) ] =

1

w  z

w(cid:17)1/2

w  z

g(z, z) (cid:16) z

g(z, z) .

(9)

(10)

note that each term from eqs. (7,8) appears a second time with z being replaced by the
variable z. one can easily work out commutation relations between the full generating
elements t(w), j(w) and the bulk primary elds g(z, z). it is obvious from our discussion
of boundary elds that bulk elds g(z, z) can be written as products of chiral vertex
operators,

g(z, z) = g(z) g(z) .

7

the formulas we have reviewed here would enable us to perform a direct computation of
arbitrary correlations functions g(~z) for bulk-elds g(z, z) with two twist elds  inserted
at x = 0 and x = ,

g(~z) := h| 1(z1, z1) . . . n(zn, zn)|i where (z , z) = g (z , z) .

the calculations would proceed by moving all annihilation operators to the right until they
act on the ground state |i. the same techniques would apply if there are extra boundary
elds g(x) inserted in addition to the bulk elds g(z, z). since we will develop another,
more generally applicable approach to the computation of correlation functions below, we
do not enter details here.

before we conclude this subsection, we would like to derive bulk-boundary operator product
expansions which allow to expand our bulk elds g(z, z) in terms of boundary operators
[9]. the essential idea is that, in the presence of a boundary, bulk elds split into products
of chiral vertex operators inserted at points which are obtained from each other by reection
at the real axis and with opposite charges (method of image charges). in order to obtain
concrete formulas, we rst rewrite the bulk elds g(z, z) = g(z)g(z) in terms of
x>(z, z) = x>(z)  x >(z) and x<(z, z) = x<(z)  x <(z),

2(cid:19)2h
g(z, z) = (cid:18) i

(zz)h(cid:18)z + z
z  z(cid:19)2h

eigx<(z,z) eigx>(z,z)

.

(11)

we have used the expression in lemma 2 and then normal-ordered the right hand side
with the help of the bch formula, which leads to the additional z- andz-dependent
factor.

for arguments z = x + iy close to the boundary, i.e.,
lemma 3 (bulk-boundary ope):
y > 0 small, the operators g(z, z) can be expanded in a series involving boundary primary
elds, with leading asymptotics

g(z, z) 

eigx0
y2h

1

for x > 0 ,

g(z, z)  y2h 2g(x)

for x < 0 ,

where 1 is the identity eld.

proof: let us begin with the case x > 0 in which z  z  0 as y becomes very small.

2(cid:19)2h
g(z, z) =(cid:18) i
2(cid:19)2h
(cid:18) i

(zz)h(cid:18) z + z + 2zz

iy(cid:19)2h

z  z
1 =

(cid:19)2h

eigx<(z,z)eigx>(z,z)

1
y2h 1 .

8

we have also used that x<(x, x) = x0 and x>(x, x) = 0 for x > 0, which is a direct
consequence of the dirichlet boundary condition.
if x < 0 and y tends to zero, the sum z +z vanishes and we can estimate the behaviour
of g(z, z) according to

2(cid:19)2h
g(z, z) =(cid:18) i
(cid:18) i
2(cid:19)2h

z  z

(zz)h(cid:18)
x2h (cid:18) iy

z + z  2zz(cid:19)2h
2x(cid:19)2h

eigx<(z,z)eigx>(z,z)

e2igx<(x)e2igx>(x) = y2h 2g(x) .

observe that boundary condition changing operators themselves do not arise from the
bulk-boundary ope of bulk elds. let us nally note that operator product expansions
for bulk elds or for boundary elds can be worked out with the same techniques. those
for bulk elds g(z, z) of course agree with the usual ope of primary elds in the bulk.

2.4 correlation functions and the knizhnik-zamolodchikov equation.
this
subsection contains the main result of this section, namely a derivation of the knizhnik-
zamolodchikov equation for correlation functions of bulk and boundary primaries in the
presence of a transition from dirichlet to neumann boundary conditions at the origin. let
us look more closely at correlation functions containing n chiral elds g(z),

f (~z) := h| 1(z1) . . . n(zn)|i where  (z) := g (z ) .

before we start, let us state two elementary formulas for the action of j>(w), t>(w) on
the ground state |i :

t>(w) |i = (cid:18) 1
j>(w) |i = xr1/2

w2 h +

1
w

l1(cid:19) |i ,
ar |i wr1 = 0 ,

(12)

(13)

where h is the conformal weight of the state |i. we will recover the equation h = 1
in a moment. the object h| dual to |i obeys the relations h| j<(w) = 0 = h| t<(w).
a rst dierential equation is obtained by inserting the generating eld t(w) into the
correlation function:

16

h| t(w)1(z1) . . . n(zn) |i = h| t>(w)1(z1) . . . n(zn) |i

h

(w  z )2(cid:19) +

w h| 1(z1) . . . n(zn) l1 |i .

here, we have commuted t>(w) through the elds  (z ) until it acts on the ground state
|i so that we can use formula (12).

9

now we want to compute the same correlation function with the help of the ane sugawara
construction, i.e. by exploiting eq. (6):

h| t(w)1(z1) . . . n(zn) |i

1
2 h| j>(w)j>(w)1(z1) . . . n(zn) |i +

this is the knizhnik-zamolodchikov equation we were after. note that the terms in square

3. twisted knizhnik-zamolodchikov equation for multiple

transitions

in the following, we study n-point functions of a free bosonic eld theory on the half-plane
with several insertions of twist operators placed along the boundary. in the corresponding
string diagrams, open strings stretch between three or more branes of various dimensions.
as long as only one dn-jump occurs, a simple hilbert space formulation of the boundary
cft is available, and we can solve, in principle, for correlation functions by purely algebraic
techniques, as indicated in the last section. in the presence of many boundary condition
changing twist elds, it may be simpler to resort to ope methods and to the theory of
complex functions on higher genus riemann surfaces, and this is the approach we pursue
in the present section. we begin with a very brief review of relevant input from the
theory of hyperelliptic surfaces. we then discuss ward identities in the second subsection.
the latter allow us to derive a system of linear rst order dierential equations for the
correlation functions similar to the knizhnik-zamolodchikov equations. note that free
bosons on higher genus surfaces without boundaries (i.e. higher loop diagrams of closed
strings propagating in a at target) have been studied in great detail in [4,26].

3.1 hyperelliptic surfaces. our aim is to investigate a scenario in which a bosonic
eld x(z, z) is dened on the upper half-plane with boundary conditions switching between
dirichlet and neumann at 2g + 2 points xi, i = 1, . . . , 2g + 2, on the boundary. without
loss of generality, we shall assume that x2g+2 =  =: x0. to be more precise, we impose
dirichlet boundary conditions in the intervals ]xi, xi+1[ for i odd and neumann boundary
conditions along the rest of the boundary, i.e.,

and

x(z, z) = xk
0

for

z = z  dk := ]x2k1, x2k[

yx(z, z) = 0

for

z = z  nk := ]x2k2, x2k1[

.

the variable y is dened through z = x + iy, and k = 1, . . . , g + 1. in terms of the chiral
currents j(z) = i x(z, z) and j(z) = i x(z, z), these conditions become

j(x) = j(x)

for

x  dk ,

and

j(x) = j(x)

for x  nk

.

as in the previous section, it is convenient to work with a single eld j that contains all
information about the two chiral currents j and j. such a eld necessarily lives on a
two-fold branched cover of the complex w-plane, namely on the hyperelliptic surface, m ,
of genus g which is described by the equation

2 = p (w) :=

2g+1yi=1

(w  xi) .

introducing branch cuts along the intervals nk = [x2k2, x2k1] , we obtain a particular
coordinate patch of this surface with local coordinate w.
in this chart, j(w) satises
j(w) = j(w) for imw > 0 and j(w) = j(w) for imw < 0. the virasoro eld t obeys the

11

gluing condition t (x) = t (x), all along the boundary, since it is quadratic in the currents.
consequently, the generating eld t(w) is dened on the complex w-plane and coincides
with t (resp. t ) on the upper (resp. lower) half-plane.

the coordinate w on the complex plane lifts to a meromorphic function of degree 2, also
denoted by w, on the hyperelliptic surface m . this function denes a two-fold covering of
the sphere branched over 2g + 2 points q1, . . . , q2g+2, where w(qi) = xi. a basis for the
space of holomorphic 1-forms on m is then given by

k :=

for

k = 1, . . . , g .

wk1dw

pp (w)

it will be convenient to work with a canonical homology basis {k, k} on m chosen as in
figure 2. we denote by kl the period of the 1-form l along the cycle k, i.e.,

the basis of holomorphic 1-forms, {k}, dual to the canonical homology basis {k, k} is
dened by the equation

kl :=ik

l =ik

.

wl1dw

pp (w)

ik

l = kl .

in particular, we have the relation

k =

gxl=1

lk l ,

and the matrix  is invertible. the period matrix  is given by

kl :=ik

l ,

and it is known to be symmetric and to have positive denite imaginary part. the surface
m has an anti-holomorphic involution induced by complex conjugation on the complex

plane. in terms of the functions w and  =pp (w), it can be written as

(w, )  ( w, ) .

this involution will be used to extend the theory from the upper half-plane to the lower
half-plane while taking care of the boundary conditions on the real axis. there is a second
holomorphic involution that interchanges the two sheets of m and that can be written as

this involution is used when passing from the sphere with cuts to its cover m .

(w, )  (w, ) .

3.2 the ward identities.
to begin with, we introduce the correlations that we
plan to investigate below. besides the primary bulk elds g(z, z) := exp(igx(z, z)), they
involve 2g +2 boundary twist elds inserted at the points xi, which induce changes between
dirichlet and neumann boundary conditions. from our discussion in the previous section
we know that there is an innite number of boundary condition changing operators that
we could insert. but it is sucient to study the elds (x) of conformal weight h = 1
16 ,
since all others can be obtained out of (x) by ope with chiral elds. thus, our discussion
deals with correlators of the form

g(~z, ~x) = h1(z1, z1) . . . n(zn, zn) (x1) . . . (x2g+1)i

(17)
where we use the notation  = g , and where the boundary eld (x2g+2) = () is
absorbed in the notation h. . .i = h| . . .|0i, with |0i denoting the vacuum state. we could
insert further boundary elds g(z). their interpretation depends on whether they are
inserted in an interval with dirichlet or neumann boundary conditions.
in the former
case, they could induce jumps in the dirichlet parameters xk
0 if they are associated with
open strings stretching between branes at dierent positions. a boundary operator g(z)
inserted in one of the neumann intervals, on the other hand, creates an open string which
has both ends on the same brane (a euclidean 1-brane, in our case) and moves with some
denite momentum along its world-volume.

as far as ward identities are concerned, correlation functions of such boundary elds are
actually more fundamental, since one may split the bulk elds g(z, z) into a product of
g(z) and g(z). for this reason, most of our investigations below involve the correlation
functions

from which the correlators g(~z, ~x) can be reconstructed.

f (~z, ~x) = h1(z1) . . . n(zn) (x1) . . . (x2g+1)i

,

(18)

our analysis will make essential use of the mittag-leer theorem, and hence it is based on
the study of singularities in correlation functions. the latter are encoded in the operator
product expansions between chiral elds and the bulk and boundary elds appearing in
(17,18). for the virasoro eld t one has the standard expansions:

hg

(w  z)2 +
(w  x)2 +

h

w  z

w  x

z (cid:21) g(z) ,
x(cid:21) (x) .

t(w) g(z)  (cid:20)
t(w) (x)  (cid:20)

(19)

(20)

here and in the following, the symbol  means equal up to terms which are regular as
w  z. according to the rule g(z, z)  g(z)g(z), the operator product expansions
of t with g contain further terms in which z is replaced by z (note that hg = hg). these
formulas may be compared with equations (7) and (12) in section 2. for our correlation
functions, eqs. (19,20) imply

the situation is more subtle for the current j(w), which we recall is only well-dened on
a surface of genus g. more precisely, j(w)dw is a meromorphic 1-form on a hyperelliptic
surface. for the operator product expansion of j(w) with the eld g(z), we shall use

j(w) g(z) dw 

g(z) dw .

(22)

g

pp (w)pp (z)

w  z

indeed, the right hand side has a rst order pole at w = z with residue g and is regular
otherwise. equation (22) generalizes formula (8) in section 2.2. to determine the oper-
ator product expansion between j and the twist eld (x), we observe that the leading
contribution

j(w) (x)  (w  x)h 1h  (x) + . . .

must involve a eld  of conformal weight h = h + 1/2 + z. otherwise, the expansion
would not be consistent with the periodicity properties of j close to the branch point
at w = x. among the boundary condition changing operators, there is one eld with
conformal weight h = 1
16 which gives rise to the most singular contribution diverging
with (w  x)1/2, cf. the spectrum (4) computed above.
after multiplication of the previous equation with dw, we are supposed to study the right
hand side in the local coordinate  = w  x. the outcome is rather simple: the form
(w  x)1/2dw = 2d on the right hand side is regular at  = 0 so that we conclude

2 + 1

j(w) (x) dw  0 ,

(23)

i.e., the singular part of the operator product expansion between j(w)dw and the twist
eld (x) vanishes.

as we will see, the following important formula is a consequence of these operator product
expansions:

hj(w) 1(z1) . . . n(zn) (x1) . . . (x2g+1)i

where

are obtained from the values of the bosonic eld

to derive the formula (24) we exploit the fact that a meromorphic 1-form on a compact
riemann surface is determined by its principal part up to some holomorphic 1-from. op-
erator product expansions, on the other hand, contain all information about the principal

14

part. hence, from eqs. (22,23) we conclude that

(25)

note that the insertion points z and xi parametrize a whole family of meromorphic 1-
forms, and the coecients k may depend on them. actually, we can determine this
dependence completely. to this end we integrate the above equation along a loop k which
surrounds the interval [x2k, x2k+1], as shown in figure 2. on the right hand side of our
equation, this integral may be expressed in terms of the matrix  and

bk(z) := ik

pp (w)pp (z)

(26)

note that the matrix elements kl and the functions bk(z) depend on the insertion points
xi. with these conventions we nd

g bk(z ) f (~z, ~x) +

nx=1

kl l

gxl=1

next, let us analyze the integral over the left hand side of equation (25). by a deformation,
we can make the integration contour k symmetric under a reection    along the
real line. now, we may split k into two parts >
k  0 and
im<
k  0, so that each piece lies entirely in one of the half-planes. with these conventions,
our contour can be written as a composition k = >
k . if we
recall, in addition, that the eld j coincides with j on the upper and with j on the lower
half-plane we deduce

k with the property im>

k which obeys <

dx(w, w) = i (xk

) .

in the penultimate step, we have expressed the currents through the bosonic eld x by
j(w) = i x(w, w) and j( w) = i x(w, w). the contour integral over the dierential dx
is nally determined by the values of x at the boundary. for the integration over the left
hand side of (25), this result implies that

ik

dw (l.h.s. of (25)) = i (xk

0  xk+1

0

) f (~z, ~x) =: i kx0 f (~z, ~x) .

putting all this together, we arrive at the following formula for the function k(~z, ~x):

k(~z, ~x) =

kl  i lx0

nx=1

gxl=1

gbl(z)! f (~z, ~x) =: k(~z, ~x) f (~z, ~x) .

the functions k introduced here depend on the insertion points z , xi, the charges g and
the values xk
0 of the bosonic eld at the boundary. additional information, e.g., on the
unknown function f (~z, ~x), is not needed. this concludes our derivation of eq. (24).

3.3 the twisted knizhnik-zamolodchikov equations. we now start to exploit
formula (24) together with the sugawara construction of the energy-momentum tensor t
to compute the eect of inserting the eld t into our correlation functions. if we include
one extra eld g(u) into eq. (24), dierentiate with respect to u and set g = 0, we obtain
as a consequence of j(u) = 1

the same correlator has been computed in eq. (21) directly with the help of operator

to conclude this section, we come back to the original correlators g(~z, ~x) of bulk-elds

formulated with the help of the following functions:

taking into account the equation g(z, z) = g(z)g(z), we conclude that the correlation
functions g(~z, ~x) must satisfy the following set of rst order linear dierential equations:

g(~z, ~x) = a g(~z, ~x)

we have introduced the function hi(xi) :=qj6=i(xi  xj). note that the term in brackets

has a simple pole at x = xi which we cancel by the extra factor x  xi before performing
the limit. equations (28) through (31) constitute the main result of this section.

4. construction of correlation functions

it remains to reconstruct the correlation functions g(~z, ~x) from the system of linear rst
order dierential equations that we obtained in the previous section. integration of the
equations is, in principle, straightforward, but it leaves one constant factor undetermined.
the latter is found explicitly in terms of the boundary conditions. moreover, we shall
manage to express the correlators g(~z, ~x) in terms of rather elementary building blocks.

4.1 integration of the z-connection. to begin with, we simplify our problem by
xing the insertion points of the boundary twist elds (xi) and considering only the
dependence of g~x(~z) = g(~z, ~x) on the positions (z , z) of bulk elds. this means that
we have to integrate the z-connection az dz + az dz dened in eqs. (29,30) . the result
will be written with the help of two functions g0(z, w) and s0(w) which are given by

g0(z, w) := 2 rez z
vx(cid:20) 2 rez z

x

v

s0(z) := lim

0(, w) d ,

0() d  log(v  v)  re log p (v)(cid:21) .

(32)

(33)

here, the point x is chosen to lie in the dirichlet-interval ]x1, x2[. the integrand in eq.
(32) is regular on the real axis and hence the integral is well dened. one can easily see

18

that its value neither depends on the starting point x  ]x1, x2[ nor on the choice of the
curve  from x to z. in contrast, the integrand 0() in our denition of s0(z) has a simple
pole on the real axis. this is the reason why we subtract the divergent term log(v  v)
before taking the limit v  x. the contribution re log p (v) is added to render the whole
function independent of the integration contour and, in particular, of the starting point x.
more details on the denition of s0(z) and a discussion of its properties can be found in
appendix b.

the two functions we have just dened possess a number of abstract properties that char-
acterize them uniquely. first of all, it is not dicult to see that g0(z, w) is simply a
greens function on the upper half-plane, i.e., it obeys

zg0(z, w) = 4(z  w)

for

imz > 0

and the boundary conditions

g0(z, w) = 0 for

z  di

,



imz

g0(z, w) = 0

for

z  ni

.

a standard computation shows that g0(z, w) is symmetric in its arguments, g0(z, w) =
g0(w, z).
the function s0(z), on the other hand, is harmonic throughout the whole upper half-plane,
i.e. zs0(z) = 0. it diverges at the boundary with a leading singularity of the form

s0(z)   log |z  z| + . . .

for re z  (cid:26) di

ni

.

(34)

we are now in a position to integrate the dierential equations (29,30) for the correlators
of bulk elds g(z, z). the result is given by

log g~x(~z) = z ~z

in the rst line we have chosen some arbitrary curve in the conguration space of n particles
in the upper half-plane starting at points w with imw > 0. the integration constant
( ~w) depends on the choice of the starting point and has to be xed such that the resulting
function log g~x(~z) satises the desired boundary conditions. in passing to the second line,
we have extended the integration to w = x on the boundary and inserted the denitions
(32,33) of the functions g0 and s0. then we use the auxiliary formula

to prove this formula one should notice that the function on the l.h.s. of the equation is
harmonic in the upper half-plane, that it satises neumann boundary conditions along
the intervals nk and that it approaches the constant values xk
0 for z  dk. by explicit
computation, one can establish the same behaviour for the function on the r.h.s. since
these properties are sucient to determine the functions uniquely, the desired equation
follows. we employ it to bring the third term of eq. (35) into a form that allows the most
explicit control of the boundary behaviour and hence is quite appropriate for xing the
remaining (x).

4.2 integration of the x-connection. before we address the integration of the full
connection (29,30,31) below, we investigate another simplied situation in which there
are no bulk elds present. consequently, the charges g in the equation (27) can be set
to zero, and we are confronted with the problem of solving the following equation for
z(~x) := g(~x):

kl ilx0 xk1

2hi i log z(~x) =   gxk=1
where hi denotes the function hi = qj6=i(xi  xj) as before, and  = {lx0}. these

4.3 the correlation functions g(~z, ~x). the results of the previous two subsections
can be combined into explicit expressions for the correlators g(~z, ~x) of bulk elds g(z, z)
and boundary twist elds (x). to see this we note that solutions of the dierential
equations (28) can be found by integrating the connection 1-form aw dw + a w d w +
ai di along an arbitrary curve (t) = (~z(t), ~x(t)), t  [0, 1], that ends at the point (~z, ~x)
in the (2n + 2g + 1)-dimensional real conguration space.
with some care (see the rst subsection) we can start the integration with all insertion
points being on the real axis. furthermore, we may choose  such that all twist-elds are
moved to their nal position at ~x before we begin moving the bulk elds into their desired
locations.
in more mathematical terms this means that  consists of two parts  = (2)  (1) with
t(1)
2 , the bulk elds are
located at points w =  (t) belonging to the rst dirichlet interval d1 =]x1, x2[. this
implies 0(x, (t)) = 0 for t  [0, 1
2 ], so that one term in our expression (31) for axi
drops out. hence, we are precisely in the situation considered in the previous subsection,
and the integration of our connection 1-form over  in the interval t  [0, 1
2 ] gives z(~x).
when we continue the integration to t = 1, we add the expression for log g~x(~z) computed

in eq. (35). after some rewriting, the following result for the correlations function g(~z, ~x)
is obtained:

g(~z, ~x) = z(~x) exp  nx=1

it is quite instructive to interpret each of the three factors in our nal expression for the
correlation function g(~z, ~x) directly within conformal eld theory. for the moment, let
us specify the number of bulk elds in g by some extra superscript, i.e. we shall write
g(~z, ~x) = g(n)(~z, ~x). now consider the object

(z ) :=

1
ig

log(cid:18)

g(n)(~z, ~x)

exp(g2s0(z )) g(n1)(~z, ~x) (cid:19)

where ~z denotes the set of n  1 bulk coordinates z,  6= . it is easy to determine the
behaviour of (z ) as a function of the bulk coordinate z from the bulk and bulk-boundary
operator product expansions of the elds g(z , z), cf. subsect. 2.3:

z (z ) = 2 x6=

g (z  z)

(z) = xi
0

for

z  di

,



imz

(z ) = 0 for

z  ni

.

these properties characterize the function (z) uniquely, and by standard formulas from
electrostatics we obtain that (z ) = (n1)
(z). an iteration of this construction along
with g(0)(~x) = z(~x) leads to our product formula (36) for the correlation function
g(~z, ~x).
the three factors can be interpreted as follows: z(~x) is a partition function corre-
sponding to some line charge distribution provided by the twist elds alone; the term

is the electrostatic potential corresponding to a conguration of n point particles with
charges g1, . . . , gn located at the points z1, . . . , zn and line charges distributions along the
dirichlet intervals. the term

can be interpreted as a renormalized electrostatic self-energy of the point particles located
at z1, . . . , zn.

4.4 path integral approach and extensions.
before we conclude, let us briey
sketch how the theory can be formulated in the path integral approach. this is important
for the following two reasons: first, as long as one is only interested in free bosons, the
path integral approach is a powerful alternative to our analysis above involving knizhnik-
zamolodchikov connections. the path integral formulation allows for a more direct com-
putation of the correlation functions (but it does not easily extend to non-abelian group
targets.) secondly, using path integrals we will be able to describe rather easily possible
extensions of our analysis to compact targets and to d-branes with b-elds.
to begin with, we consider once more the familiar situation of a non-compact 1-dimensional
target and dirichlet parameters xi
0. we denote by g the greens function of the laplacian
on the upper half-plane,

subject to the boundary conditions

zg(z, w) = (z  w) ,

g(x, w) = 0
y g(x, w) = 0

for x  d ,
for x  n .

the gaussian measure with covariance g and mean 0 is denoted by g, and we use 
for the corresponding random variable. with the help of the dirichlet parameters xi
0, we
dene a real-valued function  on the upper half-plane by

 = 0 ,

|di = xi
0 ,

y|ni = 0 ,

i = 1, . . . , g + 1 .

the eect of the dirichlet parameters is incorporated through a shift of the random variable
 by  which gives us the bosonic eld x =  + . it appears when we construct the basic
elds of the theory, namely the vertex operators

g(z, z) = : eigx(z,z):

.

in this framework we could recover the correlation functions above by integrating products
of elds g(z, z) using the gaussian measure.

0 and on neumann parameters denoted by yi

when the free boson x takes values in a circle s1, the boundary conditions depend both
on dirichlet parameters xi
0. the neumann
parameters determine the dirichlet parameters of the t-dual theory and can be thought
of as the strength of constant wilson lines turned on along a neumann direction. in sect.
3, we have worked in a local chart with the neumann intervals cut out. information on
neumann parameters is, therefore, lost unless we take a second chart into account which
has cuts along the dirichlet intervals. as above, we can derive knizhnik-zamolodchikov
equations for each chart; the full correlation functions of the compactied theory are to

22

be built up from the respective solutions in such a way that the boundary conditions are
met.
the path integral computation of correlators is rather easy to adjust to the compacti-
ed situation: if we set neumann parameters to zero and restrict attention to the elds
g(z, z), we can use precisely the same formulas as above.
in order to incorporate non-vanishing neumann parameters yi
eral correlators for elds (c)
lattice, we introduce a real-valued function  on the upper half-plane dened by

0 and to compute more gen-
g,g(z, z) with (g, g) taken from an even, self-dual lorentzian

 = 0 ,

|ni = yi
0 ,

y |di = 0 ,

i = 1, . . . , g + 1 .

then, we set

g,z(w) := gg(w, z) + (w) ,

where g denotes the greens function of the laplacian on the upper half-plane with
interchanged dirichlet and neumann boundary conditions, i.e.,

for x  d ,
for x  n .
we now introduce the disorder operators dg(z, z) satisfying

g(w, z) = (w  z) ,
y g(x, z) = 0
g(x, z) = 0

dg(z, z)f [dx] = f [dx + dg,z] ,

for any functional f . the left- resp. right-moving chiral vertex operators can then be
written as

g(z) =  g

2

(z, z)d g

2

(z, z) ,

g(z) =  g

2

(z, z)d g

2

(z, z) ;

see also [15] for more details and for an application to soliton quantization in 2-dimensional
theories. the basic elds of the compactied theory are products

where (g, g) lies in some even, self-dual lorentzian lattice.

(c)
g,g(z, z) = g(z) g(z)

another extension would involve the appearance of b-elds on our d-branes. this has
attracted some interest recently, because of its relation with non-commutative geometry,
see e.g. [13,30,31, 3,14] and references therein. non-trivial b-elds can only exist if one of
our branes is at least 2-dimensional. for simplicity, we shall focus on a pair of a dp-and a
d0-brane. the eld strength on the dp-brane will be denoted by b. in terms of boundary
conditions for a multi-component free bosonic eld, the situation is described as follows

tx a(t, 0) = 0

and

x a(t, ) = ba

b tx b(t, )

for

a, b = 1, . . . , p .

23

the spectrum of the associated boundary condition changing operators and the greens
functions in the presence of two twist elds have been discussed at various places (see
e.g. [31,10]). our techniques from sections 3 and 4 allow to extend such investigations to
the case of multiple twist insertions. instead of giving the details here, we simply state
how one has to adjust the path integral computation to the new scenario. this is rather
easy: all it requires is to replace the function g above by some matrix valued greens
function gb = (gab
b ). the latter is a greens function for the laplacian 1p  on the
upper half-plane (1p denotes the p-dimensional identity matrix), subject to the boundary
conditions

gab

b (x, w) = 0

for x  d ,

y gab

b (x, w) = iba

c xgcb

b (x, w)

for x  n .

with the help of this function, the calculation of correlators proceeds as before.

5. outlook

we have succeeded in decomposing the complete bulk and boundary correlators in the
presence of dn-transitions into functions with rather natural interpretations  both from
the point of view of electrostatics and from the cft perspective. this is useful for carrying
out the remaining step in the computation of string amplitudes, namely the integration
over insertion points of elds on the world-sheet. the calculation of such string amplitudes
gives eective actions involving a hyper-multiplet  which comes with the twist elds. to
leading order, the bosonic part of these actions can be found in [12, 22,20]. multiple twist
insertions allow to compute higher order corrections.
when we turn on a b-eld, the string amplitudes may be described through eld theories
on some non-commutative space. it was suggested in [31] that these theories are related to
some model on an ordinary commutative space through a complicated non-linear transfor-
mation. this statement can be checked order by order in the eective description. after
the appropriate (but straightforward) extension to non-vanishing b-elds, the considera-
tions presented above may be used to perform a similar analysis for theories which contain
a hyper-multiplet .

keeping the bulk insertions xed, the sequence of correlators with arbitrarily many twist
eld insertions can be viewed as building blocks of the perturbation series of a relevant
perturbation by the twist eld. this tachyon condensation is responsible, e.g., for the
formation of d0-d2 bound states, as discussed in [18]. upon integrating over twist eld
insertion points in the one-point functions z(~x) exp{g2s0(z)}, one would arrive at one-
point functions which characterize the boundary theory after tachyon condensation. sens
approach [32] and the results of [28] allow one to circumvent the relevant boundary ow
and to replace it by a combination of marginal bulk and boundary deformations. however,
some questions as to the equivalence of both procedures remain open, and it might be useful
to have an independent check of these methods. the correlation functions constructed here
provide a starting point.

24

for applications to superstring theory, it is mandatory to extend our analysis to free
fermions. this does not pose serious problems, since systems of an even number of fermions
can be bosonized.
problems of the type of our free boson problem are encountered in general boundary cft
as soon as the parent cft on the plane admits dierent boundary conditions. the spec-
trum of boundary condition changing operators can be derived as in sect. 2, once boundary
states for the constant boundary conditions are known. again, the computation of corre-
lators becomes non-trivial if boundary conditions with dierent gluing automorphisms are
combined. in non-abelian wzw models, which constitute and important generalization
of the free boson case, the sugawara construction can be exploited in a similar fashion as
for the free boson and leads to twisted, non-abelian knizhnik-zamolodchikov equations.
the partition functions counting bccos in non-abelian boundary wzw models are lin-
ear combinations of the twining characters investigated in [16]. apart from the models
with ane lie algebra symmetry, there is the rather large class of so-called quasi-rational
cfts [23] on the plane for which generalizations of knizhnik-zamolodchikov equations
exist even without a sugawara form for the energy-momentum tensor [2].
it might be
interesting to see how such structures extend to boundary cft.

proof of lemma 2: the derivation of the commutation relation with j>(w) is straightfor-

that h = g2/2. then,

in the process of this computation we have inserted the commutation relation between
ln, ar and eq. (5). the rest involves only standard algebraic manipulations.

b: the function s(z).

in this appendix we want to explain a number of properties of the function s0(z) that is
introduced in section 4.1. to show that the limit limvx exists, we insert the denition
of 0() into eq. (33) . after splitting o all non-singular terms in 0 we obtain:

s0(z) = lim

vx(cid:20) 2 rez z

v

0() d  log(v  v)  re log p (v)(cid:21)

26

vx(cid:20)  2 rez z

d  log(v  v) + regvx(cid:21)

1
  

v

vx ]

.

= lim

= lim
vx

since the singularity from the integral cancels against the term log(v  v), the limit can
be taken.

our second aim is to understand that s0(z)  sx
0 (z) does not depend on the choice of x.
let us displace x by some small amount a  r such that x + a is still in the dirichlet
interval d1. comparison of sx

0 (z) and sx+a

(z) gives

0

0 (z)  sx+a

p (v)

# = 0 .

in passing to the second line we omitted all terms in the integrand which vanish when 
comes close to the real axis.

finally, we investigate the behaviour of s0(z) at the boundary. basically, one repeats
the analysis we have sketched above in our discussion of limvx. if the end-point z of
our integration approaches one of the dirichlet intervals, this leads to the singularity

  log |z  z|. in the argument one needs that the quotientpp (z)/p (z) in front of the
singular term 1/(z  z) satises limzxpp (z)/p (z) = 1 for x  dk. this is no longer
taking the square root we conclude that limzxpp (z)/p (z) = 1 for x  nk and hence

true when z is sent to the real axis in one of the neumann intervals nk. in fact, upon
moving x from a neumann into a dirichlet interval, the polynomial p (x) changes sign,
causing the quotient p (z)/p (z) to surround the origin of the complex plane once. after

s0(x)  log |z  z| near the neumann intervals.
