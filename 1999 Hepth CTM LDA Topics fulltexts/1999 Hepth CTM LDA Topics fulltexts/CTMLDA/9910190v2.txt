abstract

we prove a mahoux-mehtatype theorem for nite-volume partition functions of su (nc  3)
gauge theories coupled to fermions in the fundamental representation. the large-volume limit is
taken with the constraint v << 1/m4
. the theorem allows one to express any k-point correlation
function of the microscopic dirac operator spectrum entirely in terms of the 2-point function.
the sum over topological charges of the gauge elds can be explicitly performed for these k-point
correlation functions. a connection to an integrable kp hierarchy, for which the nite-volume
partition function is a  -function, is pointed out. relations between the eective partition functions
for these theories in 3 and 4 dimensions are derived. we also compute analytically, and entirely
from nite-volume partition functions, the microscopic spectral density of the dirac operator in
su (nc) gauge theories coupled to quenched fermions in the adjoint representation. the result
coincides exactly with earlier results based on random matrix theory.

introduction

while it has been known for some years that random matrix theory provides universality classes
that describe the microscopic spectrum of the dirac operator in theories with spontaneous breaking
of chiral symmetry [1, 2, 3], it is only more recently that the precise relationship is become unraveled
[4, 5, 6]. the essential point is that the random matrix theory partition function, in a particular
scaling limit, becomes identical to the eective eld theory partition function in an analogous scaling
limit [1, 7]. this scaling limit is best thought of in nite-size scaling terms, as it requires sending the
space-time volume v to innity with the constraint that v  1/m4
, where m generically indicates
the pseudo-goldstone masses. at the level of fermion masses mi, one keeps the product i = miv
xed,  being the innite-volume chiral condensate. using the universality proof of ref.
[3] one
easily establishes that the relation between the partition functions holds universally, independently of
the chosen random matrix theory potential [8]. the established identity between the two partition
functions is not sucient to establish that the microscopic dirac operator spectrum can be computed
in random matrix theory, but a series of surprisingly simple relations that express all microscopic
spectral correlators of on random matrix theory in terms of the universal partition functions [4]
indicate that one must be able to compute the microscopic dirac operator spectrum directly from an
eective eld theory that is suitably extended by additional fermionic species. the supersymmetric
formulation of partially quenched eective lagrangians provides an analytical framework where this
can be established [5, 6]. this is an important point, because it proves, starting directly from the
eective eld theory partition function that the microscopic dirac operator spectrum coincides with
that obtained universally from random matrix theory.

in the derivation of microscopic spectral correlators of the dirac operator one makes ecient use of
the fact that one can insert factors of unity inside the eld theory path integral by means of cancelling
fermionic and bosonic degrees of freedom. thus, for the one-point spectral function, the spectral
density itself, it suces to insert one such pair, and hence consider a partially quenched eld theory
partition function of the form

z =

(1.1)

v , mb

here  is the topological charge, and the additional (quenched) fermion-boson species have masses
mf
v that eventually are taken to be equal (which makes the two determinants cancel). it is also
clear [5] that in order to derive higher k-point spectral correlation functions one will have to insert k
such additional factors, which pairwise cancel in the end:

z =

(1.2)

let us for clarity here briey restrict ourselves to the universality class of the chiral unitary ensemble
(chue) in random matrix theory language, which is the appropriate universality class for su(nc  3)
gauge groups with nf fermions in the fundamental representation (as was implicitly assumed when
we wrote down the partially quenched partition functions above). to obtain the spectral correlation
function from the eective nite-volume partition function one needs to take a discontinuity at a cut
in a kth order chiral susceptibility. using the technique of the rst of ref. [5] it should be possible to
rewrite this, at the level of the eective lagrangian, in terms of a partition function extended with 2k

2

additional species, all of purely imaginary masses. while this has not yet been explicitly established
beyond the one-point function, it seems beyond any doubt that it will be possible to carry such a
program through. the reason one can say this with such condence is that it is known, if one accepts
the use of random matrix theory for all spectral correlators, that the k-point spectral function in
the chue universality class can be be written [4]

(1.3)
where on the right hand side each additional mass ij is two-fold degenerate. indeed, the supersym-
metric coset needed to derive the k-point spectral function is gl(nf + k|k) [5], which precisely involves
a nite-volume partition function of k + k additional species.

however, it is known from random matrix theory that there exists a dierent, and far more compact,
expression for the spectral k-point function:

()
s (1, . . . , k;{}) = det

a,b

k ()
s (a, b;{}) ,

(1.4)

where the microscopic kernel k ()
functions alone [4]:

s (a, b;{i}) also can be expressed in terms of nite-volume partition

(1.5)

the formula (1.4) is just one out of three compact expressions for the k-point spectral correlators of
all three classical matrix ensembles, which we generically (although their history date much further
back) shall denote mahoux-mehta relations [9]. taken together with the expressions (1.3) and (1.5)
it implies a surprising identity for the partition function, which was noted in the last of reference [4],
and which we shall denote consistency condition i (to be stated in precise form in section 2 below).

although consistency condition i is valid without any doubt, it has been derived through the rather
tortuous route of going through a random matrix theory representation for the partition function.
it is of interest to see if this identity can be proven directly from the eective partition function itself,
without recourse to random matrix theory. in this way one can logically replace the expression for
the k-point spectral correlation function derived through the supersymmetric technique (1.3) by the
much more compact master formula (1.5) and the relation (1.4), without having to make use the
random matrix theory formulation. one of the purposes of this paper is to provide such a direct
algebraic proof.

random matrix theory implies a number of other identities among the eective nite-volume partition
functions, that cannot easily be guessed from these partition functions themselves. one of these, which
we shall denote consistency condition ii below, can be derived in the random matrix theory language
from the relationship between orthogonal polynomials and the kernel. we shall prove this relation, too.
curiously, if read conversely this one single relation allows one to derive unambiguously the eective
partition function for any number of avors nf , starting with just two boundary conditions, such
as the eective partition function for nf = 0 and nf = 1 (which are both trivial).

yet other partition function identities arise from the rather simple relationship between orthogonal
polynomials in the chue and ue random matrix theories, relevant for qcd-like theories in 4 and

3

3 space-time dimensions, respectively. as we shall show in this paper (see section 4), these rela-
tions imply surprising identities among the well-known harish-chandra integral and the external eld
problem, both for gauge groups u (nf ).

the existence of a long list of miraculous identities involving the eective partition function that
is relevant for the microscopic dirac operator spectrum is undoubtedly related to the fact that this
partition function can be written as a  -function of the integrable kp hierarchy, as we shall discuss
in section 5. the connection between the microscopic dirac operator spectrum and this integrable
system is certainly interesting in its own right, and may in addition be used to shed new light on the
universal analytical expressions that have been obtained. it is also intriguing that this connection
suggests that the eective theories relevant for describing the microscopic part of the dirac operator
spectrum may be topological in the sense of witten [10], i.e. having an entirely dierent formulation
in terms of a brst-exact eld theory action. intuitively this is perhaps understandable from the fact
that the eective partition function in this regime stems from the zero modes of the pseudo-goldstone
bosons alone, with no kinetic energy contribution. no degrees of freedom can therefore propagate in
this eective theory.

having established what we call consistency condition i, we get as a by-product the -dependent
normalization factor in front of the spectral k-point function. with this factor explicitly known, one
can then perform the sum over topological charges  of the gauge eld congurations to provide a
compact expression for this k-point function in terms of the full eective partition functions that are
already summed over topological charges. we do this simple derivation of the full k-point function in
section 6. in section 7 we turn to one of the other universality classes, labeled chse, which is the one
relevant for su(nc  2) gauge theories with nf fermions in the adjoint representation. the analogous
formula for the microscopic spectral density, as derived through random matrix theory [4], involves
the partition function of four additional species. we check that the resulting formula is correct at
least in the fully quenched case by explicitly evaluating the relevant eective partition function for
four avors. finally, section 8 contains our brief conclusions. some technical details are relegated to
the appendices.

before starting with the main part of the paper let us x the notation for clarity. the nite-volume
partition function for qcd-like theories in even space-time dimensions can be written [11]

where the matrix a is dened either by

(nf )


z

({}) = det a({})/({2})

a({})ij = j1

i

i+j1(i) ,

i, j = 1, . . . , nf ,

(1.6)

(1.7)

or alternatively (by making use of standard bessel function identities, and invariance properties of the
determinant),

(1.8)

(1.9)

a({})ij = j1

i

i (j1)


(i) ,

i, j = 1, . . . , nf .

the denominator is given by the vandermonde determinant of the squared masses

({2}) 

nf

yi>j

(2

i  2

j ) = det

i,j h(2

i )j1i .

in the literature a dierent sign is very often chosen inside the product, which leads to an overall
i  2
nf -dependent sign compared with the determinant deti,j[(2
j ).

nf
i<j(2

i )j1] = (1)nf (nf 1)/2q

4

this just gives an overall sign in the partition function eq. (1.6), which normally is irrelevant. let
us stress, however, that only with the denition above the partition function z
({}) is a positive
quantity. we choose the form (1.9) in what follows.

(nf )


2 consistency condition i

first of all let us recall the consistency condition relating the determinant of partition functions with
and a partition functions with nf + 2k avors as it has been stated in [4].
nf + 2 avors z
using properties of determinants eq. (11) of the third ref. [4] is equivalent to

(nf +2)

(nf )


.

(2.1)

the proportionality constant that remained undetermined in [4] is therefore xed1 as we will see below
to be c (k)

2 = (1)k(+[nf /2]).

in order to prove eq. (2.1) we make a more general statement which will be more easy to prove due
to the lack of degeneracy of the fermion masses, which is present on the right hand side of eq. (2.1):

z

. (2.2)

taking the degeneracy limit i = i, i = 1, . . . , k , we recover the original claim eq. (2.1).

we will not be able to give a proof of the above statement in full generality.
in a rst step we
will prove that it holds in the asymptotic regime where f , i, j  . in particular this xes the
proportionality constant in eq. (2.2) which may depend on nf and . in a second step we can prove
eq. (2.2) for nite arguments and any k  n in the quenched case nf = 0 in an arbitrary topological
sector . using the established avor-topology duality [12] in this nite-volume scaling regime, we
have then automatically also proven the identity for any number of massless avors nf in a sector of
any topological charge . the statement eq. (2.2) is this case reads

theorem - consistency condition i (massless):

(nf )


({}) = det a({})/({2}) be dened as in eqs.(1.6)(1.9). for nf massless avors the

let z
following identity holds, where we have chosen the constant z

(2.3)

proof: (i) asymptotic region (massive, eq. (2.2)):

1there is a misprint in eq. (11) of the third paper in ref. [4], where the overall factor should read c (k)

2

(1)k(+[nf /2]).

inserting the explicit form of the partition function into eq. (2.2) and factorizing out common parts
of the vandermonde determinants eq. (2.2) can be brought into the following form:

det

det a({}, a, b)

where we have taken all arguments to innity and where ({},{},{}) is now the vandermonde

(2.9)

which is nothing else than cauchys lemma. the asymptotic analysis performed so far determines
the mass independent overall proportionality constant in eq. (2.2) to be unity.

(ii) proof for nf massless fermions with arbitrary  (eq. (2.3)):

due to the avor-topology duality it is sucient to prove the statement for nf = 0 with arbitrary
 6= 0, and then shifting   nf + . let us rst give an outline of the proof. we will proceed with
the simplied version eq. (2.4) of the theorem for nf = 0, where the vandermonde determinants
have been already cancelled.
in a rst step we shall further simplify det a({},{}) using lemma
1 in the appendix a. there it is shown that det a({},{}) is given by a determinant similar to a
vandermonde containing powers of i and i as well as rst derivatives with respect to these variables

6

acting on a product of bessel functions of the same index . in this form we can prove the theorem
by performing a laplace expansion of the right hand side of eq. (2.4) and using lemma 2 for the left
hand side.

starting with the right hand side the determinant can be rewritten using lemma 1:

det a(1, . . . , k, 1, . . . , k) = (1)

k(k1)

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

i )j1 and
where b() is the matrix of the vandermonde determinant of squared arguments b()ij = (2
c() is the same as b with an additional i~i in each row, which is dened to act only on the bessel
functions. if we perform a laplace expansion with respect to the rst k columns into k  k blocks we
can use the fact that the resulting determinants det b det c can all be rewritten as the product of two
vandermonde determinants times k linear dierential operators that can be taken out of det c. we
obtain

(2.11)

(2.12)

the permutations  run over all possible (cid:16) 2k
variables with ordered indices respecting (1) < . . . < (k) and (k + 1) < . . . < (2k). the sign of
the permutation is dened by (1) = (1)1+...+k+(1)+...+(k) .
the building blocks of the left hand side of eq. (2.4) are the 2  2 determinants

k (cid:17) permutations to put 2k variables into 2 sets of k

det a(a, b) = (bb  aa)i (a)i (b)

(2.13)

where we have used again lemma 1 eq. (a.2). therefore we can rewrite the left hand side as

with the derivatives only acting on the bessel functions.

using again the fact that determinants diering only by a single column can be added, eq. (2.14) can
be rewritten as a sum of determinants containing only one derivative b~b or a~a, a = 1, . . . , k. due
to the structure of the determinant in the columns with b~b the derivative can be taken out as a
common factor. after reordering columns we end up with

7

such that i(1) < . . . < i(i) and i(i + 1) < . . . < i(k). the factor (1)i stems from taking out the
common factor minus one of all columns containing derivatives with respect to the s.

we can now apply lemma 2 where det g(i; i) is evaluated by laplace expansion and cauchys lemma,
to obtain

in the rst sum the number of s in the rst vandermonde is made explicit to be i.

this equation is nothing else than the operator in eq. (2.11) acting on qk
to see this we observe that in eq. (2.16) we have pk

i (cid:17)2
i=0(cid:16) k

= (cid:16) 2k

to the number of permutations in eq. (2.11). in order to map individual permutations including signs
we use again the notation eq. (2.12). the index (j) of the s thus changes according to

k (cid:17) dierent terms, which matches

i=1 i(i)i (i), where here

(j)  k + (j)  (j + k) ,

which implies(1)(1)+...+(i) = (1)(1+k)+...+(i+k)ik. consequently we obtain

and (ki) s with ordered indices {i(k+j); j = 1, . . . , i}  {k+1, . . . , 2k} as in the rst vandermonde
in eq. (2.11). we have thus completed the matching of both sides of theorem eq. (2.3).

in this section we will prove the following theorem relating partition functions with nf , nf + 1 and
nf + 2 massive avors, as it has been stated in the last of reference [4].

a few remarks can be made here. taking the inverse statement, the dierential equation eq. (3.1)
 () = i() can be seen as a generating

together with the boundary conditions z (0)

 = 1 and z (1)

8

(nf )


in this way we can actually derive the precise form of the partition
equation for all z
function eqs. (1.6)(1.9) instead of taking it as a starting point. in ref. [13], an even more compact
recursive relation for the partition functions was derived in the random matrix theory formulation,
using the supersymmetric formalism.

({}).

the consistency condition eq. (3.1) had been conjectured in the third reference of [4] (eq. (16)) with
an arbitrary constant, which has been determined here to be c = 1. this result follows independently
from inserting the asymptotics of the bessel functions.

proof: before going into the details let us give the general outline of the proof. we will rst investigate
({}, ).
the action of the power-counting operator p
most of the outcome will be again proportional to the same partition function which then drops out
due to the antisymmetry with respect to  and  in the bracket in eq. (3.1). the remainder times the
({}, ) expanded once will then precisely arrange to the laplace expansion
partition functions z
of the left hand side with respect to the last two columns. throughout the proof we will make use of
3 dierent lemmas collected in appendix b.

let us start with the action of the power-counting dierential operator on the vandermonde in the

nf

ii + ) ({2}, 2) = (nf + 1)nf ({2}, 2)

(3.2)

since the operator counts the sum of all powers. from the product rule every factor in  gets
dierentiated twice and is thus reproduced with a factor of 2 in front, furthermore there are (nf +
1)nf /2 such factors. hence the dierentiation of the s drops out of eq. (3.1) due to the (  )
antisymmetry. inserting the explicit form of the partition function we obtain

det a(, ) = (det a)1

after cancelling the vandermonde determinants. here and in the rest of this section we have omitted
the dependence of the matrix a on the set of variables i. next we apply the dierential operator to
the determinant of a(). since it is linear and the matrix a depends on each variable only in one row
we can dierentiate row-wise, using

(ni+n()) = (2n + )ni+n() + n+1i+n+1().

(3.4)

here in the last term ak is the matrix a with the k-th row shifted to the left by one unit, (ak)kl =

ki+l(k) and ak = a else, which results from the last term in eq. (3.4). this last term which can
be further simplied using lemma 3 in appendix b will be the only term that survives in eq. (3.3).
the second term  det a vanishes immediately due to the antisymmetry in eq. (3.3).

we will now show that also the rst term in eq. (3.5) is proportional to det a and thus drops out. the

4 relations between qcd3 and qcd4 partition functions

let us rst recall how the consistency condition i and ii of the the previous sections have been
originally derived in [4]. the important point is that every nite volume partition function equals a
partition function of a massive chiral random matrix model in the microscopic large-n scaling limit.
the fact that in matrix models the orthogonal polynomials, the associated kernel, as well as all cor-
relation functions can be expressed in terms of matrix model partition functions translates the well
known relations between these objects to relations among nite volume partition functions. consis-
tency condition ii reects the christoel-darboux identity between the kernel and the orthogonal
polynomials, and consistency condition i is the mahoux-mehta relation among k-point correlation
functions and the determinant of the kernel.

in this section we will follow the same reasoning to translate relations between matrix model quantities
for qcd3 and qcd4 to the corresponding nite volume partition functions. in contrast to the previous
section we will not provide a proof solely based on nite volume partition functions. while the
identities are very easily derived in terms of the random matrix theory formulation, they translate,
in the microscopic large-n limit into highly non-trivial relations between group theory integrals of
harish-chandra type (for unitary groups) and what can be called the external eld problem for unitary
groups. these surprising identities deserve to be understood in their own right.

let us start with a relation between the orthogonal polynomials the chue (qcd4) and those of the
ue (qcd3):

p

(nf , =1/2)
n, chu e

(z2;{}) = p

(2nf )

2n, u e (z;{}) .

(4.1)

this simple identity is very easily derived from the dention of the two random matrix theories
as given in [16]. since in ref.
[16] no explicit use was made of the measure, eq. (4.1) also holds in
the massive case2. on the right hand side the same nf masses appear in pairs with opposite sign.
expressing the orthogonal polynomials by partition functions as given in the second of ref.
[4] we
obtain

(nf +1)

=1/2 ({}, i)

(nf )

.

(4.2)

here the unknown proportionality constant only reects the choice of normalization for the polynomi-
als, and it can easily be xed. since we have started with an even polynomial the odd-avor partition
function on the right hand side is given by [2]

z

(2nf +1)

qcd3 = z du cosh[tr(mu u )] ,

(4.3)

where m=diag (1, . . . , nf ,1, . . . ,nf , i) and =diag(1nf ,-1nf +1). the denominator is given
by the 3-dimensional even-avor partition function [2],

z

(2nf )

qcd3 = z du exp[tr(mu u )] ,

(4.4)

with m=diag (1, . . . , nf ,1, . . . ,nf ) and =diag(1nf ,-1nf ). these group integrals are both
of the harish-chandra type, while the left hand side of eq. (4.2) is given by an entirely dierent ratio
of unitary group theory integrals of the external-eld kind. this is the rst of such relations.

2in contrast to [16] we have shifted the non-integer part to the left,  = 1/2, in order to deal with a physical (even)

number of massive avors for qcd3 on the right hand side.

11

the relation between the orthogonal polynomials eq. (4.1) can be exploited furthermore in order to
relate also the corresponding kernels of the chue and the ue. for convenience, let us introduce the
wave functions

n()  q()pn() ,

where () is the measure function (so that the wave functions n() are orthogonal with respect to
a weight of unity). now, from eq. (3.11) of ref. [16] we can use the wave functions of the ue inside
the christoel-darboux identity for the chue kernel3. doing this, we readily derive the following
identities:

where for clarity we have not explcitly indicated the mass dependence of the wave functions. the coef-
cients c2n are dened in ref. [16]. we have here made use of the fact that in the ue the polynomials
pn() are of parity (1)n. as one can easily convince oneself the last equation is, despite its appear-
ance, symmetric in the arguments z and w. expressing the kernels in terms of the corresponding nite
volume partition functions [4] eq. (4.6) leads to the following relation:

(4.7)
the proportionality constant is known in this case as it can be determined for both kernels from the
matching condition with the microscopic spectral density.

let us nally mention that also in the case of qcd3-like theories with an odd number of massive avors
a relation similar to eq. (4.6) exists. in ref.[14] the random matrix model kernel for odd-avored qdc3
has been derived from a chue, which in the microscopic scaling limit reads:

(4.9)

for more details on the odd-avor partition function we refer to ref. [14].

we have explicitly checked all of the above relations for a few (small) number of avors, starting
from the nite-volume partition functions alone. apart from those given above, we have empirically
found other non-linear relations between these harish-chandra type integrals and those of the unitary
external eld problem. these relations, however, do not seem to follow easily from the random matrix
theory formulation.

3eq. (4.1) trivially holds also for the wave functions instead of the polynomials.

12

5 the eective qcd4 partition function as a  -function

the identities derived above may have their origin in a surprising relation to integrable systems, which
we shall now briey discuss. the starting point is the following observation. suppose we dene an
nf  nf hermitian matrix integral by

 (x) = z dy exp [tr[xy + v (y )]] .

(5.1)

with x itself being an nf  nf hermitian matrix, and the potential v (y ) as yet unspecied, this is
a generalized external eld problem of random matrix theory. the universality of its correlation
functions have been proved in the microscopic large-nf limit in [15] for polynomial potentials v (y ).
surprisingly, a closed solution of the integral eq. (5.1) can be written down for any value of nf , and
for any potential v (y ) that satises suitable convergence criteria [17, 18]. after diagonalizing the
y -matrix, y = u diag(y1, . . . , ynf )u , one obtains the standard jacobian of (y)2, and one can then
make use of the harish-chandra integral to obtain

 (x) = z y dyi

(y)
(x)

exp
xj

(xjyj + v (yj))
 ,

where the xi are the nf eigenvalues of x. if one now introduces the function

(x)  z dyexy+v (y) ,

as well as the derivatives

one sees that the integral is simply

k(x) 

k

xk (x) = z dyykexy+v (y) ,

 (x) =

det[j1(xi)]

(x)

.

(5.2)

(5.3)

(5.4)

(5.5)

this shows that  (x) is a  -function of the integrable kp hierarchy.

the expression (5.5) has an uncanny resemblance to the nite-volume partition function if one identies
xi = 2
i . this is particularly clear if one considers the form (1.7), and starts with the case  = 0.
using the bessel function identity

dk

d(x2)k (cid:16)xnf inf (x)(cid:17) =

1
2k xnf kinf k(x) ,

we see that the partition function (1.6) can be written in the form (5.5) if we identify

(2) = (cid:18)q2(cid:19)nf

inf (q2) ,

(5.6)

(5.7)

and ignore irrelevant overall factors. the case of non-zero  can then be treated by using again the
avor-topology duality [12], thus obtaining the  6= 0 case by simply setting  of the nf masses to
zero. in fact, eq. (5.7) alone suces to prove that the eective partition function is a  -function of
the integrable kp hierarchy [17]. it is nevertheless interesting to note that in addition an integral

13

representation actually exists such that the partition function explicitly can be written in the form
(5.1) [19]. this turns out to correspond to a potential v (y ) = 1/y  nf ln(y ), and an integration
contour for the eigenvalues encircling the origin. (strictly speaking this is outside the scope of the
hermitian matrix formulation (5.1), so the notion of hermiticity is here simply taken to mean of
at measure  see ref. [19] for a discussion of this point).

knowing that the partition function is a  -function immediately implies a number of identities. the
most general of these is the following set of hirota equations, which read [17]

0 = (xa  xb) (x; pa, pb, pc + 1) (x; pa + 1, pb + 1, pc)
+ (xb  xc) (x; pa + 1, pb, pc) (x; pa, pb + 1, pc + 1)
+ (xc  xa) (x; pa, pb + 1, pc) (x; pa + 1, pb, pc + 1) .

(5.8)

here the pi denote the multiplicities of the parameters xi for i = a, b, c, where in our notation xi = 2
i .
due to the jacobi identity for determinants yet another identity holds for  -functions as given in e.g.
eq. (2.43) of ref.[17]:

 (nf +2)({x}, xnf +1, xnf +2) =

1

(xnf +1  xnf +2) (nf )({x}) 

 h (nf +1)({x}, xnf +1) (nf +1)({x}, xnf +2)  (xnf +1  xnf +2)i .

(5.9)

the upper index indicates the number of parameters of the corresponding  -function and  means that
in the last row the index of the functions k(x) in eq. (5.4) has been shifted by +1. this relation looks
remarkably similar to our consistency condition ii eq. (3.1). however, in eq. (3.1) the derivatives,
which shift the indices of the k are taken with respect to all variables.
in the derivation of the
consistency condition ii we have used properties of the bessel-functions in only one step, namely in
eq. (3.4). the fact that all  -functions eq. (5.5) obey the property

can probably be used to show that all  -functions obey our consistency condition ii.

2k(x) = xk(x)|x=2 = k+1(x)

(5.10)

there exists another set of relations for  -functions of the kp hierarchy which apparently can be
related to our nite-volume partition functions. according to ref. [20] these relations read

 (cid:16)t +pk
a=1([1
qk
a,b(a  b) (t)

a ])(cid:17)
a ]  [1

det

1a,bk"  (t + [1

a ]  [1
(a  b) (t)

b

])

# =

k

ya<b

(a  b)(b  a)

at rst sight they look remarkably similar to our consistency condition i in the form of eq. (2.2). in
order to to explain the dierences let us give the notation of eq. (5.11) from ref. [20]. the argument of
k=1 tkk.

the  -function t stands for all the coupling constants or times in a matrix potential v () = p

the bracket [ ] then is a shorthand notation for

 (t  []) =  (t1  , t2 

1
2

2, t3 

1
3

3, . . .) .

(5.12)

performing the sum over the additional parameter [1] in the potential leads to an additinal loga-
rithmic term v ()  v ()  ln(1  /), which resembles an extra mass term if we could consider

14

this as an ordinary hermitian random matrix theory in which one has taken the microscopic limit.
such an identication is, however, far from obvious. moreover, in eq. (5.11) these extra terms occur
in pairs  and  with opposite signs and thus one of them appears as a bosonic mass term. due
to this dierence, apart from other additional factors, we have not been able to explicitly match our
consistency condition i eq. (2.2) with eq. (5.11). moreover, no direct proof has been given in ref.
[20] for the relation eq. (5.11), and we have not been able to nd it elsewhere.

6 summing over topological charges

({}) in sectors of
so far our discussion has been restricted to nite-volume partition functions z
xed topological index . these partition functions can be thought of as fourier coecients of the
full partition function, which for given vacuum angle , is given by

(nf )


z (nf )(,{}) =

(6.1)

or, in terms of the eective partition function on the coset of chiral symmetry breaking in this case,

z (nf )(,{}) = zsu (nf )

du exphv re [ei/nf trmu ]i .

(6.2)

({}) in sectors of xed gauge eld topology, the
contrary to the eective partition functions z
group integral of eq. (6.2) is not known in closed form for nf  3. we are not aware of any analogue
of the theorems discussed above for the full partition functions, and in view of the non-linearity of the
relations it seems unlikely that they could be established. nevertheless, as an interesting by-product
of the above analysis we are now able to provide a simple compact formula for any k-point spectral
correlation function after having summed over all topological charges.

(nf )


the rst observation is that for any observable hoi in the xed- theory one nds the same observable
in the full theory by summing over  with weight factor eiz

({}):

(nf )


hhoii =



x=

(nf )


eiz

({}) hoi .

(6.3)

next, noting that the k-point spectral correlation function by itself is just an expectation value, also
this function can be summed over topological charges:

s(1, . . . , k; ,{}) = z (nf )(;{})1



x=

(nf )


eiz

({}) ()

s (1, . . . , k;{}) ,

(6.4)

where we have not included the zero-mode contributions in the spectral sums, and where we have
already taken the microscopic limit.

we now make us of the fact that the k-point function in a sector of xed topological charge  can
be expressed in terms of a partition functions with 2k additional species as in eq.
(1.3). as a
side result of proving the consistency condition i in section 2 we have already xed the constant

15

c (k)
2 = (1)k(+[nf /2]). only the -dependence is important for the summation over topological
charges, where it leads to a shift in the -angle:

s(1, . . . , k; ,{}) = z (nf )(;{})1

(6.5)

due to the periodicity of the angle  we need to know the partition function at either a shifted or
unshifted vacuum angle  for the k-point correlation function with k either even or odd 4.

7 fermions in the adjoint representation

with nf fermions taken in the adjoint representation of the gauge group su(nc  2) the pattern
of spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking, if it occurs at all, is believed to proceed according to
su(nf )  so(nf ).
in the random matrix theory classication this corresponds to the chiral
symplectic ensemble chse. fermions in the adjoint representation of the gauge group occur in e.g.
supersymmetric gauge theories even without matter elds, but its interest in the present context stems
more from the fact that staggered fermions in the fundamental representation and gauge group su(2)
actually also fall into this universality class away from the continuum limit. in ref. [22] the eective
partition function in the same nite-volume limit as above was written, in a sector of xed topological
charge  = nc, in terms of a relatively simple-looking group integral over the unitary group u(nf ):

(nf )


z

(m) = z du (det u )2 exphv re trmu u ti ,

(7.1)

where as before m denotes the mass matrix. this group integral is surprisingly dicult to perform
explicitly, and it has in fact until now only been evaluated for nf = 2 fermions of equal mass, and any
topological charge  [23]. in general, the equal-mass partition functions are much easier to evaluate
due to an interesting rewriting of the group integral (7.1), which is valid for those cases [22]. we shall
here use that form to explicitly evaluate the group integral for nf = 4 equal-mass fermions in a sector
of zero topological charge (the derivation extends straightforwardly to any topological charge, but we
have not considered that extension in detail).

the partition function (7.1) of nf equal masses has been be rewritten by smilga and verbaarschot as
(for nf even) [22]:

where, in our normalization, the nf  nf matrix a has elements

(nf )


z

(m) = pf(a) ,

apq =

(  )ei(p+q)e cos + cos +i(+) ,

4in [21] a factor of (1)[nf /2] is missing in the formula for the density (corresponding here to k = 1).

(7.2)

(7.3)

16

and the indices p and q run from  nf

2 . again   mv is the (common) rescaled
mass. a for our purposes convenient innite-sum representation was also given in ref. [22], based on
a fourier series expansion of the sign function in eq. (7.3):

2 to nf

2  1

2 + 1

apq =



xk=

1

2k + 1

i+p+k+ 1

2

()i+qk 1

2

() .

(7.4)

it is with this form of the matrix a that we have managed to evaluate the partition function (7.1) for
nf = 4 equal masses and  = 0 (this last restriction can readily be lifted). after some tedious algebra
we nd (technical details can be found in appendix c):

z (4)
0 () =

1

2 hi1(2)2  i0(2)2i +

1

23 i0(2)z 2

0

dti0(2) .

(7.5)

the last integral is explicitly known in terms of a combination of struve and bessel functions, but we
leave the result like this in order to facilitate a comparison to be discussed below.

the reason for our interest in the partition function (7.1) is a general relation derived in the third of
ref. [4], which expresses the microscopic spectral density of the dirac operator for this case in terms of
the partition function itself and the partition function with 4 additional fermion species of imaginary
(degenerate) masses:

s (;{}) = c4 3 (2 + 2)4 z
()

(nf +4)


z

({},{i})
({})

(nf )


.

(7.6)

the normalization coecient c4 can be xed as soon as one settles on the normalization of the partition
functions. the general formula (7.6) as derived in ref. [4] in the random matrix theory formulation
(and the partition functions involved were therefore those of random matrix theory, too). but in the
microscopic limit these coincide, modulo uninteresting mass-independent normalization factors, with
the eld theory partition functions (7.1), thus giving explicitly the microscopic spectral density in
terms of the eld theory partition functions, as indicated. although this general formula may provide
a simple way of deriving the massive double-microscopic spectral density for this universality class, it
has not yet been tested due to the lack of a simple analytical expression for the partition functions
(7.1). now, with the analytical result (7.5) we can for the rst time check the formula, since for
the quenched case (formally dened by taking nf to zero) the partition function itself becomes an
uninteresting constant (which we take to be unity), while the partition function in the numerator of
eq. (7.6) is that of just four fermions (of imaginary and degenerate masses).

using well-known relations between bessel functions and modied bessel functions, we thus derive the
quenched microscopic spectral density of the dirac operator for this case:

(0)
s () = c43z (4)

0 ({i})

= c4([j0(2)2 + j1(2)2] 

1
2

j0(2)z 2

0

dtj0(t)) .

(7.7)

if we next impose the matching condition s(  ) = 1/, then the overall constant in front is xed
to c4 = 1. this nally gives

(0)
s () = [j0(2)2 + j1(2)2] 

1
2

j0(2)z 2

0

dtj0(t) ,

(7.8)

17

which agrees exactly with the result obtained directly from random matrix theory [24].

in a derivation of the formula (7.6) directly from a partially quenched chiral lagrangian, the four-
fold mass-degenerate additional fermion species should come out from coset of the supergroup chiral
symmetry breaking of that case. the fact that one is led to four additional quarks is a somewhat
surprising feature, as in a very naive counting one could have expected two: one from the additional
quenched quark, and one from its supersymmetric partner.
it is therefore very comforting to see
that the recent explicit computation of the partially quenched eective lagrangian by toublan and
verbaarschot [6] in this case precisely leads to four additional species in total. by compactifying
variables after taking the discontinuity that gives the spectral density it should therefore now be
possible to derive the formula (7.6) directly from the eective lagrangian, following the steps of the
rst of ref. [5].

8 conclusions

our main purpose here has been to show that the surprising relations among the eective partition
functions relevant for describing the microscopic dirac operator spectrum can be derived directly,
without recourse to the random matrix theory formulation. we have noted that these identities
most likely have as their origin the fact that the eective partition functions of the chue universality
class are  -functions of an integrable kp hierarchy. we believe that one of these identities, here called
consistency condition ii, holds in general for all these  -functions.

as a by-product of our analysis, we have computed the -dependent normalization factor of the k-
point spectral correlation function of the same universality class. this has allowed us to perform the
sum over topological charges  explicitly, and express the k-point function of the full theory entirely
in terms of the full eective partition functions, without the restriction to xed topological charge.

we have noted a series of relations between the eective nite-volume partition functions for qcd3-
like theories and qcd4-like theories. these relations translate into surprising relations between the
external u (nf ) eld problem and the harish-chandra integral for unitary groups.

finally, we have considered an analogous formula for the microscopic spectral density of the chse
universality class, which expresses this spectral density in terms of the eective eld theory partition
function with four additional (imaginary-mass) fermion species. we have explicitly shown that this
formula yields the same analytical result as the random matrix theory approach in the quenched
case of nf = 0. considering the analytical diculties in extending the corresponding random matrix
theory calculation to the case of massive fermions, this may provide the most economical way of
deriving all the microscopic spectral correlators of that universality class.

a some lemmas for consistency condition i

lemma 1: let a ({},{}) be the following 2k  2k matrix

(a({},{}))ij = ( j1

i
j1
i

i+j1(i)
i+j1(i)

i = 1, . . . , k

i = k + 1, . . . , 2k  j .

(a.1)

then the following statement holds:

det a({},{}) = (1)k(k1)/2(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

where the two k  k matrices b and c are given by

b()
b()

k

yi=1

c()

c() (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

i(i)i (i)

(a.2)

b()ij = (2

i )j1 ,

c()ij = (2

i )j1i~i ,

i, j = 1, . . . , k .

(a.3)

in other words b is the matrix inside the vandermonde with squared arguments whereas c contains
in addition the power counting operator in each row, which acts on bessel functions outside the
determinant only.

before proving the lemma let us add a remark. the above statement is not specic for a matrix with
variables split into 2 equal groups, as we will see in the proof below. furthermore eq. (a.2) trivially
extends to matrices a of odd size, where one additional column has to be added in the matrix b. we
have just presented the statement in the precise form as we need it in the proof of theorem 2.3.

proof: let us rst for simplicity set

we will in a rst step use the property of the bessel functions

xi  i , xi+k  i

for i = 1, . . . , k .

xin+1(x) + 2nin(x) = xin1

(a.4)

(a.5)

to reduce all indices of the bessel functions in deta({x}) down to  or  + 1. starting with the last
column we can add 2( + 2k  2) times the last but one column to it to reduce the index of the bessel
function by 2:

x2k1
i

i+2k1(xi) + 2( + 2k  2)x2k2

i

i+2k2(xi) = x2k1

i

i+2k3(xi) .

(a.6)

we proceed similarly with the last but one column and go down till the third column. all indices of
bessel functions have been reduced by 2 except in the rst 2 columns. we then start again with the
last column reducing the index by 2 (eq. (a.6) for     2) and continue down to the fth column.
so after going down through all columns k  1 times always starting from the right we have achieved

det a({x}) = det

1i,j2k(cid:18)xj1

i

i
+ 1+(1)j

2

(xi)(cid:19) .

(a.7)

in a second step we write all functions i+1(x) which appear in every second column as a derivative
xi(x) so that we can factor out all bessel functions to the right of the determinant. using eq. (3.4)
for n = 0 we have

x2l+1i+1(x) = x2l+1xi(x)  x2li(x) .

(a.8)

19

inserting this expression into every second column we can again compensate the last term in eq. (a.8)
by adding  times the column to the left. we thus have

det a({x}) = det a({x})

i(xi) ,

k

yi=1

where

( a({x}))ij = ( xj1
~xi

i
xj1
i

j = 1, 3, . . . , 2k  1

j = 2, 4, . . . , 2k

 i = 1, . . . , 2k .

(a.9)

(a.10)

here we have pulled out all common factors i(xi) out of each row i and again the derivatives only
act on these. after reordering those columns with even powers to the left and those with odd powers
times a derivative to the right, which results into a factor (1)k(k1)/2, we obtain eq. (a.2) when
renaming back the variables from eq. (a.4).

proof: we will prove lemma 2 by doing a laplace expansion with respect to the rst i columns into
i times (k i) dimensional determinants. each of the subdeterminants can then be evaluated by using
cauchys lemma eq. (2.9) for squared variables, which reads

b some lemmas for consistency condition ii

lemma 3: let a be an n  n matrix with elements akl and aj be the same matrix with the j-th row
shifted by one unit to the left: (aj)kl = akl for k 6= j and (aj)jl = ajl+1. expanding the determinant
of a with respect to the last column we have

det a =

n

(1)n+laln det a

where a

ln is the algebraic complement of aln. it then holds

det aj =

n

xj=1

n

(1)n+jajn+1 det a
xj=1

jn

(b.1)

(b.2)

proof: we have to show that when summing over the determinants of the shifted matrices aj and
expanding each of them with respect to the last column only determinants of the algebraic complement
of a remain, all the other terms containing determinants of shifted matrices cancel.

starting from the denition we obtain after rearranging terms

here we have used the same notation for the shifted matrices and applied the fact that (aj)

we will now show by induction that the double sum in eq. (b.3) vanishes. for n = 2 this holds
inside the double sum we sum over shifted matrices of size n  1 so we can apply the
trivially.

where the split is due to the missing row when expanding twice. it then follows from the obvious

det al

k = (n  l) det a .

xk=1

(b.5)

proof: let us rst state the trivial cases apart from l = 0, n. for l = 1 the determinants just dier
by the rst column and can thus be added up, giving (n 1) det a after pulling out a common factor.
for l = n  1 each al
we will now proceed by induction. due to the above remarks the cases n = 2, 3 are trivial. if we
expand the determinants on the left hand side of eq. (b.5) with respect to the last column we obtain

k can be expanded with respect to the row k which then just gives det a.

c the partition function for nf = 4 adjoint rep. fermions

we shall here give some technical details on the derivation of eq. (7.5) in the main text. our starting
point is the general relation (7.2) with, for equal masses, the matrix a given by eq. (7.4). the rst
observation is that the matrix a, apart from being antisymmetric, also has a mirror symmetry along
the line perpendicular to (the conventionally dened) diagonal. in other words:

again, using the same taylor expansion. the rst steps of this procedure give

which proves the identity eq. (c.8).

we are now ready to evaluate the pfaan of eq.
antisymmetric matrix is

where in the second line we have used our additional symmetry (c.1).

it is handy to evaluate instead 3pf(a). we then get successively, using relations (c.5), (c.6) and
(c.8):

3pf(a) = 3[a2
