abstract

in this paper, we study the renormalizability of the standard model in the landau

gauge. on the basis of the ward-takahashi identities, we derive exact expressions for

the physical masses of w and z as well as the renormalized coupling constants in the

theory. we show that it is impossible to make all these renormalized quantities nite.

thus the quantum theory of the standard model with the divergent amplitudes obeying

the ward-takahashi identities is not renormalizable.

1. introduction

in a recent paper[1], we showed that the standard model is not renormalizable in the

alpha gauge, the only possible exception being the landau gauge which is a special case

of the alpha gauge with alpha equal to zero. in this paper, we go on to investigate if the

standard model in the landau gauge is renormalizable.

in the standard model, the number of renormalized or physical parameters exceed that

of independent bare parameters. for example, once we give the bare vacuum expectation

value of the higgs eld v0 a non-zero value, we generate not just a non-zero renormalized v,

but also non-zero physical masses of w and z. since quantities in the quantum theory of

the standard model have ultraviolet divergences, it is natural to ask if all three renormalized

parameters can be made nite by a choice of one bare parameter. similarly, the two bare

electro-weak coupling constants generate renormalized coupling constants of the charged

weak current, the neutral weak current, as well as the electromagnetic current. can all these

renormalized coupling constants be made nite with proper choices of the two bare coupling

constants ?

for almost three decades, people have agreed that the answer to these questions is yes.

the key point is the validity of the ward-takahashi identities, which, many people believe,

render all renormalized quantities nite. in this paper, we spell out the specic relations

satised by the renormalized parameters as consequences of the ward-takahashi identities.

how do the ward-takahashi identities yield relations on the w -mass and the z-mass?

quantum electrodynamics oers a hint. in qed, the ward-takahashi identity for the photon

propagator insures that there are no radiative corrections to the propagator of the longitu-

dinal photon. this means that the 1pi self-energy for the longitudinal photon vanishes

identically. now at k2 = 0, the 1pi self-energy for the transverse photon is equal to that

for the longitudinal photon. consequently, the 1pi self-energy for the transverse photon

vanishes at k2 = 0. thus the inverse of the propagator for the transverse photon vanishes at

k2 = 0, signifying the existence of a massless vector meson in qed.

making use of the equality of the 1pi self-energy at zero momentum of the transverse

propagator and that of the longitudinal propagator, we shall show that the ward-takahashi

2

identities indeed lead to relations among v, the renormalized electro-weak coupling constants,

and the physical w mass and the physical z mass. these relations resemble their classical

counterparts, with additional factors involving ultraviolet divergent quantities.

we shall show that the ward-takahashi identities for vertex functions also lead to specic

relations satised by the renormalized coupling constants. there are ultraviolet-divergent

quantities in these relations.

in the derivation of these relations, we shall need the forms of various propagators ex-

pressed in terms of the 1pi self-energy amplitudes. we shall list them in the next section.

2. the propagators in the landau gauge

in the landau gauge, the unphysical higgs mesons 0 and  decouple from the longi-

tudinal vector mesons and hence we have

g00

(k2) =

i

k2  00(k2)

,

(2.1a)

(2.1b)

,

and

g+

(k2) =

i

k2  +(k2)

where g00, for example, is the fourier transform of < 0|t 0(x)0(0)|0 >, with t the
time-ordering operator, and 00 is the 1pi amplitude of g00.

the propagators involving longitudinal vector mesons vanish in the landau gauge. how-

ever, we cannot simply ignore such propagators. this is because, in the ward-takahashi

identities, a eld operator of a longitudinal vector meson is always multiplied by a factor
1/, where  is the gauge parameter. thus, as we take the limit   0, terms in these
longitudinal propagators which are proportional to  should be retained. therefore, we shall

need the approximate forms of these propagators up to the order of . we have

(2.2a)

(2.2b)

in (2.2a) and (2.2b), we have chosen the gauge parameter  for a, z and w to be

the same, and have neglected terms of the order of 2. the propagators for the transverse

components of the vector mesons have not been included in (2.2).

the following propagators depend on the specic form of the gauge xing terms we use

in the eective lagrangian. in the main text of this paper, we shall choose the gauge xing

terms to be the ones given by (a.1). then we have[1]

finally, we turn to the propagators for the transverse components of the vector mesons.

the vector mesons w and z are massive. following peterman, stuckelberg[2], gell-mann

and low[3], we put the propagator for the transverse w as



w +w (k2)
iz t
k2  m 2

w

,

(2.12)

where mw is the physical mass of w . the ratio of z t

w +w (k2) and z t

w +w (0) is proportional

to the eective weak charge[2,3,4].

the propagator for the transverse z and the transverse a takes a little more manipula-

tion. this is because the transverse z mixes with the transverse a. the mixing matrix of

5

propagators is equal to the inverse of the matrix

(2.13)

where t

zz, for example, is the 1pi self-energy amplitude for the transverse z. let us

diagonalize the matrix in (2.13). by (4.1b) below, the determinant of this matrix vanishes

at k2 = 0. thus so does one of its eigenvalues at k2 = 0, with the corresponding eigenvector

representing the physical and massless photon which we shall denote as a. the other

eigenvector represents the physical z meson, which we shall denote as z . the particles a

and z  are related to a and z by an angle of rotation (k2). it is straightforward to nd

cot  =

3. the w mass and the vacuum field value

in the landau gauge, the ghosts directly interact only with the gauge vector mesons.

according to the feynman rules, the ghost-ghost-v vertex factor is proportional to k,

6

where v is a gauge vector meson,  is the polarization of v and k is the momentum of the

incoming ghost. since  is always transverse, k is equal to p, where p is the momentum

of the outgoing ghost. consequently, this vertex factor vanishes if either the momentum of

the incoming ghost or that of the outgoing ghost vanish. this is a feature which greatly

simplies some of the ward-takahashi identities at zero momenta discussed below.

there are three ward-takahashi identities associated with the longitudinal w . we have

made use of two of them in a preceding paper and get the following relation among the 1pi

self-energy amplitudes:

(1 +

w +w (k2)

m 2
0

)(1 

+(k2)

k2

) = (1 +

w +(k2)

m 2
0

)2 ,

(3.1)

where w +w , for example, is the 1pi self-energy amplitude for the longitudinal w . we

shall now explore the consequences of the third identity.

the bare mass of w is equal to

1
2

g0v0. we may choose v0 to be either the classical

vacuum expectation value of the higgs eld at which the higgs potential is minimum, or the

quantum vacuum expectation value of the higgs eld. the gauge xing terms and the ghost

terms are dierent with these two dierent choices. thus the green functions are dierent if

v0 is chosen dierently. however, the physical scattering amplitudes are the same if physical

quantities are gauge invariant.

we shall, in this paper, choose v0 to be the quantum vacuum expectation value of the

higgs eld. with this choice, the third ward-takahashi identities associated with the longi-

tudinal w is, at k2 = 0,

zw +(0) + z+(0) = z+(0) .

(3.2)

we mention that, for k2 not equal to zero, there is a ghost-ghost-higgs vertex function

appearing in this identity. this vertex function vanishes at k2 = 0 and does not appear in

(3.2), for the reason we mentioned above.

substituting (2.10a) into (3.2), and making use of (3.1). we reduce (3.2) into

(cid:18)1 +

w +w (0)

m 2
0

(cid:19)z+(0) = z 2

+(0) .

(3.3)

we will cast (3.3) into a more useful form. we note that the propagator for the transverse

7

w may be expressed by its 1pi amplitude as:



k2  m 2

i
0  t

w +w (k2)

,

(3.4)

where t

w +w  is the 1pi self-energy amplitude for the transverse w . from (2.12) and (3.4),

we get

z t

w +w (0) =

m 2
w
0 + t
w +w (0)

m 2

.

making use of the fact that t

w +w (0) and w +w (0) are equal, we reduce (3.3) into

mw =

1
2

g0v0z+(0)qz t

w +w (0)/z+(0) .

(3.5)

(3.6)

finally, v, the renormalized vacuum expectation value of the higgs eld, is equal to v0 divided

by qzh(0), where zh(0) is the wavefunction renormalization constant for the physical higgs

eld h. thus we have

hence (3.6) becomes

mw
v

=

1
2

g0z+(0)qz t

v =

v0

.

qzh(0)
w +w (0)vuut

(3.7)

(3.8)

zh(0)

z+(0)

.

if the standard model is renormalizable, the right-side of (3.8) must be nite.

we close this section with two comments:

(a)the relationship (3.8) holds in the landau gauge, a special case of the alpha gauge. one

may derive its counterpart in a general alpha gauge.

(b)the w meson is unstable, thus the propagator for the transverse w does not have a pole

at a real value of k2. we may dene m to be the value of k2 at which the real part of the

inverse of the propagator for the transverse w vanishes. this will provide a subtraction

condition for the propagator of the transverse w .

4. the z mass and the vacuum field value

next we consider the ward-takahashi identities associated with the longitudinal a and

the longitudinal z. there are nine of them in all. we have extracted the consequences from

8

seven of them. among others, we have

(cid:20)1 +

the right-side of (4.4) must be nite if the standard model is renormalizable.

5. identities for three point functions

in this section we study the consequences of the ward-takahashi identities on three-

point functions in the standard model. we shall begin by summarizing a number of relations

among the wavefunction renormalization constants which will be used in this section.

from (4.2a) and (4.2b), we obtain

zaz (0)
zz z (0)

= tan  ,

9

(5.1)

where we have made use of (2.10b), (2.14) and (4.1). together with (2.11a), and (2.11b),

(5.1) give

(5.2a)

(5.2b)

.

(5.2c)

zaa(0) =

2 sin(2) cos   cos(2) sin 

cos  sin(  )

similarly, we may derive from (2.10b) that

za0(0)

zz0(0) + z00(0)

= tan  .

(5.3)

it is also straightforward to nd that

[za0(0)]2 + [zz0(0) + z00(0)]2 = (cid:20)1 +

aa(0) + zz(0)

2

m 
0

(cid:21)z00(0) .

thus, by (2.17), we have

za0(0) =

(5.5a)

(5.5b)

we shall now derive the ward identities for the interaction of a lepton l with a gauge meson.

the rst such identity is obtained by setting to zero the vacuum expectation value of the

brst variation of

t ia(x)l(y)l(z) .

next we set to zero the vacuum expectation value of the brst variation of

t iz(x)l(y)l(z) .

we get

(5.7)

z(z) + sin a(z)(cid:21)|0 >

we note that the longitudinal a and the longitudinal z mix with the unphysical neutral

higgs meson 0. thus the external longitudinal photon in the left-side of (5.6), for example,

may propagate into a photon, or a 0. for this reason, the term on the left-side of (5.6)

gives rise to two terms, each of which corresponds to a channel of propagation. similarly,

the term on the left-side of (5.7) also give rise to two terms. we mention that, by (2.2b),the

longitudinal a does not propagate into the longitudinal z in the landau gauge.

we shall take the fourier transform of (5.6) and (5.7),denoting the momenta of the outgo-

ing lepton, the incoming lepton, and the outgoing gauge meson by p, p, and k, respectively,

with

p = p + k.

11

we take  to zero to get to the landau gauge. then we multiply the resulting expression

by ik2 (to get rid of the propagator of the external longitudinal photon) as well as by s 1

l

(p)

from the right and s 1

l

(p) from the left (to eliminate the propagators of the external leptons).

we then dierentiate the resulting equation with respect to k with p xed and on-shell,
take the limit k  0 and insert the equation between physical lepton spinor functions. we
get

where zl(p2) is the wavefunction renormalization constant for the lepton, p2 = m2, and m is

the mass of the lepton. there are 4-point amplitudes in the ward-takahashi identities, but

they vanish as we set k = 0.

since a, not a, is the physical photon eld, we take the dierence of (5.8) multiplied by

cos  and (5.9) multiplied by sin , getting

i

lla(p, p, 0) = e0

the left-side of (5.10) multiplied by zl(m2)qz t

the renormalized charge given by (5.12) is universal, i.e., the same for all leptons[5]. we

note that the form in (5.12) diers from its counterpart in qed by the last factor in (5.12).

in order that the standard model is renormalizable, the right-side of (5.12) is required to be

nite.

as before, we take the limit  going to zero and take the fourier transform of eq.(5.19), with
the momentum of the outgoing neutrino denoted by (p k) and that of the incoming lepton
denoted by p. we multiply the fourier transform of (5.19) by ik2 as well as by s 1
 (p  k)
(p) from the right, dierentiate with respect to k with p xed, and set

from the left and s 1

k to zero. since the masses of the neutrino and the lepton are dierent, we cannot make

both of these particles to be on the mass-shell. we shall choose to have the electron on the

mass-shell, i.e., we choose p2 = m2. we apply the resulting expression on the lepton spinor

function, setting /p operating on the lepton spinor function to equal to m. we get

let us multiply equation (5.20) by qz t

the second term in the left-side of the resulting equation are proportional to the renormalized
  l  w vertex the renormalized   l   vertex, respectively. if these two renormalized

6. discussion

as theoretical physicsists all know, the forms of the ward-takahashi identities in qed

are relatively simple. people also know that these identities have profound consequences, two

of them being the vanishing of the photon mass and the universality of the electric charge.

all of these consequences are easily extracted from the ward-takahashi identities in qed.

in contrast, the ward-takahashi identities in yang-mills theories are notoriously complex

in form. there are numerous terms in these identities due to the existence of interacting

ghosts. such complexities mar the rigorous implications of these identities which are more

dicult to explore.

as an example, consider using these identities in the standard model in the feynman

gauge and investigate the question of the universality of the electric charge. the ratio of

zeea and ze obtained from these identities is not identically unitythe value of this ratio

in qed. instead, it is equal to a sum of amplitudes.

it is possible to calculate this sum

perturbatively and showed that, to the one-loop order, it is independent of the lepton mass.

but to prove this true to all orders on the basis of these identities in the feynman gauge

appears dicult.

but these identities do give simple and exact consequences. for example, it is easy to

prove that the mass of the photon is strictly zero with the ward-takahashi identities. it

is also possible to prove charge universality from these identities if one uses the unitary

gauge[5].

additional consequences from these identities are found if one uses the landau gauge.

this is because these identities at k2 = 0 simplify in the landau gauge. one nds relation-

ships between the w -mass and the z-mass with the renormalized vacuum expectation value

of the higgs eld:

(6.2)

these are non-perturbative and quantum mechanical expressions for the masses of w and

z generated by spontaneous symmetry breaking. if one neglects quantum corrections and

15

set the right-sides of (6.1) and (6.2) to unity, they are reduced to the well-known classical

formulae for the w mass and the z mass.

one also nds the following three renormalized electro-weak coupling constants:

and

equation (6.3) gives the electric charge e in the standard model. equation (6.4) gives the

coupling constant gz for the neutral weak current. and (6.5) gives the coupling constant gw

for the charged weak current.

in addition, by multiplying (5.13) with zl(m2)qz t
izl(m2)qz t
= gz[l  2 sin2(  )] ,

k

ll0(p  k, p, k)|k=0

(6.6)

where p2 = m2. we note that both terms in the left-side of (6.6) are renormalized amplitudes.

thus the right-side of (6.6) must be ultraviolet nite if the standard model is renormalizable.

while the ward-takahashi identities in the standard model do lead to relationships

among various renormalized quantities, they by no means imply that all of these quantities

can be chosen ultraviolet nite. this is because there are ultraviolet divergent quantities in

these relations. for the renormalized quantities in the above equations to be nite, the right

sides of these equations must be nite. in particular, if gz and the right-side of(6.6) are both
nite,    must be ultraviolet nite for the standard model to be renormalizable.

from (6.3) and (6.4), we get

(6.7)

thus the right-side of (6.7) must be ultraviolet nite for the standard model to be renor-

malizable. but the right-side of (6.7) is not ultraviolet nite. indeed, this ratio has been

calculated up to one loop and is known to be ultraviolet divergent[5].

16

in conclusion, a quantum gauge eld theory is not completely predictive without a pre-

scription of how the ultraviolet divergences are handled. as is well-known, the prescription

in qed is that the divergent amplitudes obey the ward-takahashi identities. this leads to

predictions in spectacular agreements with experiments. if one uses the same prescription

for the quantum theory of the standard model, one also nds exact results such as charge

universality, the vanishing of the electric charge of the neutrino, and the vanishing of the

photon mass. this is borne out by experiments to an extremely high degree, as the sum of

the electron charge and the proton charge is less than 1021e, the neutrino charge is less than
1013e, and the photon mass is less than 61016ev . on the other hand, this prescription in
the standard model leads to a non-renormalizable theory, as not all renormalized quantites

can be chosen nite. we believe that the foundation of the quantum theory of the standard

model remains to be laid.

the relations among the 1pi self-energy amplitudes given by (3.1) and (4.1) remain valid.

the ward-takahashi identity (3.2) is replaced by

zw +(0) = z+(0) .

(a.5)

while the ward identities (4.2a) and (4.2b) remain the same as before. because of these

changes, some of the intermediate formulae are now dierent. for example, we have, instead

of (5.3),

za0(0)

however, the nal formulae (6.1)(6.6) stay the same.
