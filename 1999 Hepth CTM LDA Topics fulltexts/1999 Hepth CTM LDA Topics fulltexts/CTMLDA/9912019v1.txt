abstract

we show that a u (1) instanton on non-commutative ir4 corresponds to a non-singular
u (1) gauge eld on a commutative kahler manifold x which is a blowup of c2 at a nite
number of points. this gauge eld on x obeys maxwells equations in addition to the susy
constraint f 0,2 = 0. for instanton charge k the manifold x can be viewed as a space-time
foam with b2  k. a direct connection with integrable systems of calogero-moser type is
established. we also make some comments on the non-abelian case.

1. introduction

the moduli space mk,n of the charge k instantons in the gauge group u (n ) shows
up in many problems in mathematical physics and more recently in string theory. this

space is non-compact, due to the well-known phenomenon of instantons being able to

shrink, and there are several celebrated ways of (partially) compactifying this space. one

option, motivated by the uhlenbecks theorem concerning the extension of nite action
gauge elds to an isolated point, is to add to the space mk,n the space mk1,n  x
which corresponds to a single point-like instanton in the background of the smooth charge
k  1 instanton. one then further adds the space mk2,n  sym2x corresponding to
the pairs of the point-like instantons, and so on. in this way one obtains the donaldson

compactication:

d

k,n = mk,n  mk1,n  x  mk2,n  sym2x . . .  symkx.

m

(1.1)

if the space-time x is a projective surface s with the kahler form  then there is a ner
g
compactication, the space of the torsion free sheaves. this compactication m
k,n is
the space of all -stable torsion free sheaves of rank n and second chern class c2 = k.
in the case s = cip2 one can study the sheaves which are trivial when restricted to
the projective line cip1 at innity. this space m k,n has an adhm-like description.
it was shown in [1] that this space parameterises instantons on the non-commutative
space ir4 where the degree of the non-commutativity is related to the metric on the space
m k,n . this deformation of the adhm equations also arises in the study of integrable
systems of calogero-moser type [2][3][4]; these same models have appeared in connection

with supersymmetric gauge theories [5][6][7][8][9][10][11] and admit a brane description

[12][13][14].

an outline of our paper is as follows. in section two we review the physical motivation

for our work. next we will review the deformed adhm equations we are interested in,

paralleling the usual adhm construction. for a particular choice of complex structure

we nd the resulting equations describe appropriate holomorphic data. our aim is to

show this actually describes holomorphic bundles on a blown up spacetime. we begin

(section 4) by focusing attention on the abelian setting which is rather illustrative, and an

unexpected richness is found for suciently large charge. a direct correspondence with the

calogero-moser integrable system is established. section 5 continues with the nonabelian

situation. we conclude with a brief discussion.

2. physical motivation

consider the theory on a stack of n d3 branes in the type iib string theory. add a

collection of k d-instantons and switch on a constant, self-dual b-eld along the d3-brane

worldvolume. the d-instantons cannot escape the d3-branes without breaking super-

symmetry [14]. from the point of view of the gauge theory living on the d3-branes, the

d-instantons are represented by eld congurations with non-trivial instanton charge [15].

those instantons which shrink to zero size become d-instantons, and such can escape

from the d3-brane worldvolume. therefore, in the presence of the b-eld, one cannot

make the instanton shrink. one realization of this scenario was suggested in [1] where it

was proposed to view the d-instantons within the d3-brane with b-eld as the instan-

tons of a gauge theory on a non-commutative space-time. however, the non-commutative

gauge theory as arising in the zero slope limit of the open string theory in a particular

regularization can be mapped to the ordinary commutative gauge theory, as shown in [14].

therefore one is led to the following puzzle in the n = 1 case: how is it possible for the

u (1) gauge eld on ir4 to have a non-trivial instanton charge? it is easy to show that a

non-trivial charge is incompatible with the vanishing of f at innity.

at the same time, one can look at what is happening from the point of view of

the d-instantons. equally, by t-duality one can study the d0-d4 system, and look at the

quantum mechanics of d0-branes. the latter has a low-energy target space which coincides

with the resolution of the singularities m k,n of the instanton moduli space.

one can imagine probing the instanton gauge eld as in [16] (perhaps employing

further t-dualities). when the b-eld is turned on the probed gauge eld is given by the

deformed adhm construction described below. as we shall see, the resulting gauge elds

are singular unless one changes the topology of the space-time.

we suggest that this is what indeed happens.

in this way we resolve the paradox

with the u (1) gauge elds, since if the space-time contains non-contractible two-spheres

(and this is precisely what we shall get) then the u (1) gauge eld can have a non-trivial

instanton charge. as far as the concrete mechanism for such a topology change within

string theory is concerned this will be left to future work.

2

3. the deformed adhm construction

from now on we make the change of notation: k = v, n = w. let v and w be

hermitian complex vector spaces of dimensions v and w respectively. let b1 and b2 be
the maps from v to itself, i be the map from w to v and nally let j be the map from

v to w . we can form a sequence of linear maps

v 

v  c2  w 

v

where

we will also use

 =

b2
b1
j

 ,
 ,

 = ( b1 b2

i ) .

z = ( b1  z1 b2  z2

i ) .

z =

b2 + z2
b1  z1

j

suppose now that the matrices (b1,2, i, j) obey the following equations:

  = c1v ,

   =  + r1v ,
 =   r1v .

(3.1)

(3.2)

(3.3)

let us collect the numbers (r, rec, imc) into a three-vector ~  ir3. when ~ = 0 these
equations, together with the injectivity and surjectivity of z and z respectively, yield
the standard adhm construction. if one relaxes the injectivity condition then one gets

the donaldson compactication of the instanton moduli space.

in the nomenclature of

corrigan and goddard [17] describing charge v su (w) instantons,

 =

b2 b
1
b1 b
2
j

i ,

and  =   12 corresponds to the equations (3.3) when ~ = 0. we are considering a
deformation of the standard adhm equations.

the space of all matrices (b1, b2, i, j) is a hyperkahler vector space and the equa-
tions (3.3) may be interpreted as u (k) hyperkahler moment maps [18]. in particular by

performing an su (2) transformation

(cid:18) b1
b2(cid:19) 7(cid:18) b1  b

2
b2 + b

1(cid:19) ,(cid:18) i

j + i (cid:19) ,
j(cid:19) 7(cid:18) i  j 

(3.4)

3

with ||2 + ||2 = 1, we can always rotate ~ into a vector (r, 0, 0). such a transformation
corresponds to singling out a particular complex structure on our data, for which z =

(z1, z2) are the holomorphic coordinates on the euclidean space-time. further we may
choose the complex structure such that r > 0.

the moduli space m v,w is the space of solutions to the equations (3.3) up to a sym-

metry transformation

(b1, b2, i, j) 7(cid:0)g1b1g, g1b2g, g1i, jg(cid:1)

(3.5)

for g  u (w). it is the space of freckled instantons on ir4 in the sense of [19], a freckle
simply being a point at which z fails to be injective.1 observe that for r > 0 (3.3) shows
that z 

z is invertible and z is surjective.

one can learn from [20] that the deformed adhm data parameterise the (semistable)
torsion free sheaves on cip2 whose restriction on the projective line  at innity is trivial.
each torsion free sheaf e is included into the exact sequence of sheaves

0  e  f  sz  0

(3.6)

where f is a holomorphic bundle e  and sz is a skyscraper sheaf supported at points,
the set z of freckles[19]. from this exact sequence one learns that

chi(e) = chi(f )  #zi,2.

3.1. constructing the gauge eld

the fundamental object is the solution of

where

z : w  v  c2  w
z =(cid:18) z
z(cid:19) .
d



we shall need the components

z =

1
2


 =(cid:18) 

(cid:19) , 1,2  v,   v  c2,   w.

1 of course the algebra of functions at such points carries interesting information: it is a nite-
dimensional commutative associative algebra which still may have nilpotents. in this sense the

freckle is a fat point (or zero dimensional subscheme).

4

the solution of (3.8) is not uniquely dened and one is free to perform a gl(w,c) gauge

transformation,

this gauge freedom can be partially xed by normalising the vector z as follows:

z  z g(z, z),

g(z, z)  gl(w,c).

with this normalisation the u (w) gauge eld is given by



zz = 1w .

(3.10)

(3.11)

(3.12)

and its curvature is given by

more explicitly,

hence

a =

formula (3.12) makes sense for z  x   ir4 \ z, where x  is the complement in ir4 to
the set z of points (freckles) at which

now it is a straightforward exercise to show that on x

r =

(3.13)

(3.14)

(3.15)

if  c = 0 then (3.14) implies that f 0,2 = 0, i.e. the az1 , az2 dene a holomorphic structure
on the bundle ez = kerd

z over x . as we have a unitary connection, f 2,0 = f 0,2 = 0.

from (3.6) the holomorphic bundle e extends to a holomorphic bundle f on the whole
of ir4. we will now construct a compactication x of x  with a holomorphic bundle e over
x such that e|x   e, and whose connection a is a smooth continuation of the connection
a over x . this compactication x projects down to c2 via a map p : x  c2. the
pull-back pf is a holomorphic bundle over x which diers from e. this dierence is
localised at the exceptional variety, which is the preimage p1(z) of the set of freckles.

5

4. abelian case in detail

let us rotate ~ so that c = 0, r =  > 0 and consider the case w = 1. then [20]

shows that j = 0. hence, i i = 2v and [b1, b2] = 0.

we can now solve the equations (3.8) rather explicitly:

where

and

2(cid:19) = (cid:18) b

g1 = (b1  z1)(b

2  z2)

 =

1

1 + i gi

.

(4.1)

(4.2)

(4.3)

let p(z) = detg1. it is a polynomial in z, z of degree v. clearly (4.3) implies that:

2 =

p(z)
q(z)

where q(z) = p(z) +i eg1i is another degree v polynomial in z, z, eg1 being the matrix

of minors of g1.

the gauge eld (3.11) is calculated to be

and its curvature is

a = (  )log,

f =  log2.

(4.4)

(4.5)

the formula (4.4) provides a well-dened one-form on the complement x  in ir4 to
the set z of zeroes of p(z). this is just where b1  z1 and b2  z2 fail to be invertible
(and so z fails to be injective), that is a freckle. we start with the study of one such
point and then generalize.

4.1. charge one instantons.

to see what happens at such a point let us rst look at the case v = 1. then (after

shifting z1 by b

1, etc.)

z =

1

rpr2 + 2

z12
z22

r2  ,  =

6

r

pr2 + 2

(4.6)

where r2 = |z1|2 + |z2|2. thus in this case

p(z) = z1 z1 + z2 z2, q(z) = z1 z1 + z2 z2 + 2

the gauge eld is given by (setting 2 = 1):

a =

1

2r2(1 + r2)

(z1dz1  z1dz1 + z2dz2  z2dz2) ,

and

f =

dz1  dz1 + dz2  dz2

4.2. comparison with the non-commutative instanton

(4.7)

(4.8)

[14].

notice the similarity of the solution (4.7) to the formulae (4.56), (4.61) of the paper
it has the same asymptotics both in the r2  0 and r2   limits. of course
the formulae in [14] were meant to hold only for slowly varying elds and that is why

we dont get precise agreement. nevertheless, we conjecture that all our gauge elds are

the transforms of the non-commutative instantons from [1] under the eld redenition

described in [14]. from our analysis below, it follows that one has to modify the topology

of space-time in order to make non-singular the corresponding gauge elds of the ordinary

gauge theory.

4.3. the rst blowup

to examine (4.7) further let us rewrite a as follows:

a = a0  a,

a0 =

1
2r2 (z1dz1  z1dz1 + z2dz2  z2dz2) ,
1

a =

2(1 + r2)

(z1dz1  z1dz1 + z2dz2  z2dz2) .

the form a is regular everywhere in ir4. the form a0 has a singularity at r = 0.
nevertheless, as we now show, this becomes a well-dened gauge eld on ir4 blown up at
one point z = 0.

let us describe the blowup in some details. we start with c2 with coordinates (z1, z2).
the space blown up at the point 0 = (0, 0) is simply the space x of pairs (z, ), where
z  c2, and  is a complex line which passes through z and the point 0. x projects to c2

7

via the map p(z, ) = z. the ber over each point z 6= 0 consists of a single point while
the ber over the point 0 is the space cip1 of complex lines passing through the point 0.
in our applications we shall need a coordinatization of the blowup. the total space of
the blowup is a union x = u u0 u of three coordinate patches. the local coordinates
in the patch u0 are (t, ) such that

z1 = t, z2 = t.

(4.9)

in this patch  parameterises the complex lines passing through the point 0, which are not
parallel to the z1 = 0 line. in the patch u the coordinates are (s, ), such that

z1 = s, z2 = s.

(4.10)

there is also a third patch u, where (z1, z2) 6= 0. this projects down to c2 such that
over each point (z1, z2) 6= 0 the ber consists of just one point. the ber over the point
(z1, z2) = 0 is the projective line cip1 = {}  . we now show that on this blown up
space our gauge eld is well dened.

on u  u0 we may write

dene au0, as

a0 =

tdt  tdt
2|t|2 +

d  d
2(1 + ||2)

.

au0 =

au =

d  d
2(1 + ||2)
d  d
2(1 + ||2)

,

.

(4.11)

(4.12)

now a0 is a well-dened one-form on u. on the intersections u  u0 the one-forms a0
and au0 are related via a gauge transformation

i d argt.

on the intersection u0  u the one-forms au0 and au are related via

i d arg = i d arg

gauge transformations. finally on u  u the one-forms a0 and au are related via the
gauge transformation

i d args.

8

we have shown therefore that a0 is a well-dened gauge eld on x. observe also that at
innity a  0 as o(r3), which yields a nite action. in fact the gauge eld (4.7) has a
non-trivial chern class ch2:

f  f = 

2

r2(1 + r2)3 dz1  dz1  dz2  dz2

(4.13)

so that

1

42z f  f = 1.

finally, the restriction of a on the exceptional divisor e, dened by the equation t = 0 in
u0 and s = 0 in u, has non-trivial rst chern class:
f = 1.

1

2ize

4.4. charge two

in the case v > 1 the formulae (4.4), (4.3) are rather intricate. nevertheless we show

that by a sequence of blowups we are able to construct a space x on which the formula

(4.4) denes a well-dened gauge eld.

for v = 2 the matrices (b1, b2) and the vector i can be brought to the following

normal form by a complexied gauge transformation (3.5) with g  gl2(c):

b1 =(cid:18) 0 p1

0 (cid:19) , b2 =(cid:18) 0 p2
0 (cid:19) ,

0

0

i =(cid:18) 0
1(cid:19)

(4.14)

where the only modulus is p = (p1 : p2) which is a point in cip1. this data parameterises
the torsion free ideal sheaves i on c2 which become locally free on the manifold x which
is a blowup of c2 at the point 0 subsequently blown up at the point p on the exceptional
divisor.
the sheaf and its liberation. the ideal ip corresponding to p  ip1 is spanned by the
functions f (z1, z2) on c2 such that:

f  ip  f (0, 0) = 0,

p11f|0 + p22f|0 = 0,

1, z1z2, z2

i.e. ip = hp1z2  p2z1, z2
2i. this sheaf becomes locally free on the manifold x.
indeed, consider rst the manifold y which is c2 blown up at the point (0, 0). suppose
p1 6= 0, hence we may set p1 = 1, p2 = p. in the chart u0 where the good coordinates are:
(z1,  = z2/z1) the ideal is spanned by:

z1(p  ), z2

1

9

which is the sheaf o(e), where e = {z1 = 0} is the exceptional divisor, tensored with
the ideal sheaf of the point z1 = 0,  = p. upon the further blow up x  y at the point
 = p, z1 = 0 we get the locally free sheaf, whose sections vanish at the exceptional variety.
the gauge eld construction. it turns out that the solution of the equations (3.3) up to

the (3.5) group action does not dier much from (4.14). in fact,

b1 =(cid:18) 0 p1

0 (cid:19) , b2 =(cid:18) 0 p2
0 (cid:19) ,

0

0

i =p4(cid:18) 0
1(cid:19)

is the solution, provided

then formula (4.4) still holds with

|p1|2 + |p2|2 = 2.

2 =

r2(r2 + 2)  ||2

(r2 + 2)(r2 + 4)  ||2 ,

(4.15)

(4.16)

where  = z1 p1 + z2 p2. this expression naively leads to a singular gauge eld when r2 = 0.
(the denominator is nonvanishing for  > 0.) we deal with that by blowing up the point

r = 0. in this way we can write

r2 = |z1|2(1 + ||2),

 = z1(p1 + p2)

(in the patch u0) to get a factor |z1|2 from the numerator of 2. this factor is then removed
by a gauge transformation which enters the glueing function. then, for z1 = 0, we nd a
singularity at the point  = p2/p1 on the exceptional divisor in y which is removed in a
similar way by the next blowup x  y .

4.5. the higher charge case

the nice feature of the cases v  2 is that all information about the sheaves is encoded
in the geometry of the manifolds x, xp. this property may seem to be lost once v > 2.
2i. the quotient c[z1, z2]/i3 = h[1], [z1], [z2]i is
take for example the ideal i3 = hz2
three-dimensional. similarly the ideal i4 = hz2
2i produces a four dimensional quotient
c[z1, z2]/i4 = h[1], [z1], [z2], [z1z2]i. clearly these ideal sheaves are dierent. now consider
the rst blowup x. obviously these sheaves then lift to the same sheaf of ideals, since
on x: z1z2 = z2
1  i3. thus we nd two dierent sheaves (for charges 3 and 4) which
lift to the same holomorphic bundle after a single blowup. the puzzle is what extra data

1, z1z2, z2

1, z2

is needed to distinguish them? therefore one needs a more rened way of extracting the

10

properties of the sheaf from the properties of the manifold x. perhaps the metrics on the

blown up space dier for dierent charges. we now show that the gauge elds constructed

out of the deformed adhm data describing these two ideals are dierent, so distinguishing

them.

charge three gauge elds. consider the ideal i spanned by z2
basis

1, z1z2, z2

2. let us choose the

e1 = 1,

e2 = z1,

e3 = z2

in the quotient v = c[z1, z2]/i. the matrices b1, b2 act in v as follows:

b1e1 = e2, b1e2 = b1e3 = 0,

b2e1 = e2, b2e2 = b2e3 = 0.

it turns out that a very simple modication makes them a solution of the equations (3.3).

we nd

and consequently

one nds that

and so

(4.17)

charge four. now let us take the ideal i = hz2
dimensional with the basis

1, z2

2i. the quotient v = c[z1, z2]/i is four

e1 = 1, e2 = z1, e3 = z2, e4 = z1z2.

the corresponding solution to the real moment map equations turns out to be

b1 =p3e2e

1 +pe4e

3,

b2 =p3e3e

1 +pe4e

2,

11

i =p8e1.

(4.18)

then

and

((r2 + 4)2 + 8 2)((r2 + 2)2 + 2 2)  12 2|z1z2|2 .

(4.19)

clearly this expression is quite dierent from (4.17) and so the gauge elds do somehow

distinguish the dierent ideals. both (4.17) and (4.19) require a single blowup to make

the gauge eld non-singular.
in the charge three case the gauge eld restricted onto
the exceptional divisor looks like (  )log
3 = 1 + ||2 in the u0 chart and
1 +||2 in u chart. in contrast the charge four gauge eld on the exceptional divisor has
4 =p1 + ||4 on u0 andp1 + ||4 on u. one may say that the exceptional divisor in


the charge three case is more rounded than the one in the charge four case.

elongated instantons: the general case. these are special solutions to the deformed adhm
equations that describe v  1 points which sit along a complex line. the ideal i corre-
sponding to this conguration is (in an appropriately rotated coordinate system) generated
by hp (z1), z2i, where p (z) is an arbitrary degree v polynomial. in other words the space
of elongated torsion free sheaves of rank one is isomorphic to the space of degree v polyno-
mials p . if p (z) = zv then we get v points on top of each other. we shall study this case
in some detail a little later after rst presenting the case of general p (z). since z2  i
we immediately conclude that b2 = 0. then the moment map equation r = 2 coincides
precisely with the moment map leading to the calogero-moser integrable system [21]. in

the light of [22] its solutions form a part of the phase space of the sutherland model. for us

the most convenient presentation is in terms of the dual [23] - rational ruijsenaars system
[24]. consider the polar decomposition b1  z1 = u h
2 , b2 = 0, with h hermitian and
positive denite, and u unitary. we may take b1 traceless by appropriately shifting z1.
then equation (3.3) becomes

u hu  h + ii  = 2.

this can be solved (as in [25]) by rst diagonalising h

form, viz.

observe that g1 is a tridiagonal matrix. now in order to nd  we again need e

this is easily done, the tridiagonal nature of g1 reducing the problem to one of a three
term recursion. suppose uk satises

then

and consequently

the normalisation of the uks is irrelevant. now the substitution

1, we recognise the recursion for the charlier polynomials wk = ck(1  y; x) =
2f0( k,1y

as (x)kck(a; x)/k! = l(ak)

5. non-abelian charge one freckled instantons

we now proceed with the investigations of the non-abelian case, considering the ex-

ample of charge one instantons. the deformed adhm construction in the case v = 1 gives
the space m 1,w  ir4  t cipw1. the rst factor is the space of pairs (b1, b2) which
parameterise the center of the instanton. the second factor is responsible for its size and

orientation.

specically, the second factor emerges as a quotient of the space of pairs (i, j), i 

w , j  w , such that

ij = 0,

i i   j  j = 2 > 0

by the action of the group u (1)

let us introduce two projectors

and two numbers

2 = ii ,

then 2

2 = 2. in particular 1 > 2  0, and if 2 > 0 we can write

i  = 1e1, j = 2e2,

where e1, e2 form an orthonormal pair of vectors in w . we shall distinguish between the

2 = 0 and 2 > 0 cases in what follows.

let us proceed with the adhm construction. without any loss of generality we may
assume that b1 = b2 = 0, by shifting z1, z2. the vector z : w  c2  w is found to be

z =

15

notice that in order to write the explicit formula (5.5) for the vector z we had to
make a choice of the vectors i, j in the orbit (5.2). when working on at ir4 this choice
can be made globally, i.e. in a z independent way. if we are to replace ir4 by a manifold
x over which non-trivial line bundles exist, then this choice may well become a subtle

matter, i.e. the solution to the equations (5.1) may depend on z while staying in the orbit

of the gauge group (3.5). in other words  may depend on z. in a moment we shall see

that this indeed happens.

using the relations i =

this expression is well-dened for r 6= 0. moreover  is well-dened everywhere, while

introduce the coordinates (t, ) and (s, ) by the formulae (4.9), (4.10).

the freckles: 2 = 0. this value of the parameter 2 corresponds to the torsion free sheaves
which are not locally free. for 2 = 0 the vector j vanishes, 2
and the vector z simplies to (removing the  part):

2 z2e

(5.15)

z =

we easily recognize the vector z from the abelian section. so in this case the torsion free
sheaf of rank w splits as a direct sum of the trivial holomorphic bundle of rank w 1 and a
standard charge one torsion free sheaf of rank 1 which lifts to a line bundle on the blowup.

6. discussion

our paper has been concerned with the deformed adhm equations. these equations

may be viewed as giving instantons on a noncommutative space-time. equally, and this is

the focus of our paper, they may be interpreted as gauge elds on an ordinary commutative
space-time manifold c2 or cip2 blown up at a nite number of points. the deformation

singles out a particular complex structure. in terms of this complex structure, the deformed
adhm construction yields a holomorphic bundle ez = kerd
z outside of a set of points
where z fails to be surjective. the constraint f 0,2 = 0 yielding this holomorphic structure
may be viewed as a restriction for supersymmetry. in addition ordinary instantons obey
the equation f 1,1+ = 0, which is usually viewed as xing the non-compact part of the
complexied gauge group. our solutions apparently obey another equation z(f 1,1) = 0
which also serves as a gauge xing condition. at the points for which z fails to be surjective

(elsewhere called freckles) the adhm gauge elds look singular, and we have shown that

by suitably blowing up such points the gauge elds may be extended in a regular manner.

our construction is consistent with the work of seiberg and witten who show that (to

any nite order) there is a mapping from ordinary gauge elds to non-commutative gauge
elds that respects gauge equivalence. presumably the equation f 1,1+ = 0 is mapped into
our equation z(f 1,1) which we admittedly werent able to identify in full generality.

our blowups will only be seen at short wavelengths and regulate the divergences

encountered by seiberg and witten (cf. section 4 of [14]). we conjectured that our gauge

elds are indeed the transforms of the non-commutative instantons from [1] under the

seiberg-witten eld redenitions. we believe the modications to the topology of space-

time we have described are necessary in order to make the corresponding gauge elds of the

ordinary gauge theory non-singular. for large instanton number we interpret our results

as producing space-time foam.

although our study has focused on the u (1) situation, we have shown how one may

extend to the non-abelian situation. several of the u (1) constructs reappeared in that

case. as well as being rather concrete, the u (1) situation has revealed a rather rich

structure. our low order computations show how the gauge elds can distinguish between

two dierent sheaves that lift to the same holomorphic bundle after blowup. we have also

described a general class of instantons that we called elongated. we were able to associate to

this class of solution precisely the moment map equation of the calogero-moser integrable

system and used the machinery of integrable systems to describe this case in some detail.

18

this appearance of the calogero-moser system is somewhat dierent to that of wilson

[3]. this appearance of integrable systems here, in seiberg-witten theory more generally,

and in the various brane descriptions of these same phenomena, still awaits a complete

explanation.
