non-singular string-cosmologies from exact

conformal field theories

h.j. de vega, a.l. larsenand n. sanchez

july 23, 2013

abstract

non-singular two and three dimensional string cosmologies are con-
structed using the exact conformal eld theories corresponding to
so(2,1)/so(1,1) and so(2,2)/so(2,1). all semi-classical curvature
singularities are canceled in the exact theories for both of these cosets,
but some new quantum curvature singularities emerge. however, con-
sidering dierent patches of the global manifolds, allows the construc-
tion of non-singular spacetimes with cosmological interpretation. in
both two and three dimensions, we construct non-singular oscillating
cosmologies, non-singular expanding and inationary cosmologies in-
cluding a de sitter (exponential) stage with positive scalar curvature
as well as non-singular contracting and deationary cosmologies. we
analyse these cosmologies in detail with respect to the behaviour of the
scale factors, the scalar curvature and the string-coupling. the sign
of the scalar curvature is changed by the quantum corrections in oscil-
lating cosmologies and evolves with time in the non-oscillating cases.
similarities between the two and three dimensional cases suggest a
general picture for higher dimensional coset cosmologies: anisotropy
seems to be a generic unavoidable feature, cosmological singularities
are generically avoided and it is possible to construct non-singular
cosmologies where some spatial dimensions are experiencing ination
while the others experience deation.

1 introduction and results

fundamental string eects are most important near the planck scale, thus
it seems that early cosmology will be the most likely area to test string
theory. the classical and quantum string dynamics and their associated
eects in a wide class of string backgrounds (conformal and non-conformal
invariant) have been widely investigated by the present authors[1, 2]. new
insights and new physical phenomena with respect to string propagation in
at spacetime (and with respect to quantum elds in curved spacetime) have
been uncovered [2]. conformal invariance simplies the mathematics of the
problem but the physics remains mainly unchanged. for low and high mass
the string mass spectrum in conformal and non-conformal backgrounds are
the same [3].

fundamental quantum strings demand a conformally invariant background
for quantum consistency (conformal invariance is a necessary although not
sucient condition for consistency). however, most curved spacetimes that
were historically of physical interest in general relativity and cosmology are
not conformally invariant. for instance black hole spacetimes and friedman-
robertson-walker universes, are not of this type. in string theory, a large
amount of generalizations of these general relativity solutions have been ob-
tained as solutions of the renormalization group -function equations (low
energy eective string equations). these solutions involve, besides the metric,
a number of massless elds including the dilaton and antisymmetric tensor
elds. the -function equations are the basis for most investigations in string
cosmology. however, they are perturbative and only known to the lowest or-
ders in , and therefore, the corresponding solutions are only ensured to
be conformally invariant to the lowest orders in . it is not generally clear
how the higher order corrections will change these solutions, and possible
non-perturbative solutions seem to be completely missed in this framework.
a dierent approach to string cosmology is based on group manifolds
and coset spaces and the corresponding wzw [4] and gauged wzw models
[5]. these models provide new curved backgrounds that are conformally
invariant to all orders in 1/k (where k  1/ is the level of the wzw model).
in the case of group manifolds, these models are generally too simple to
describe physically interesting and realistic cosmologies. this is exemplied
by the well-studied sl(2, r) wzw model, which describes anti-de sitter
space. for the coset spaces, on the other hand, the models are generally
so complicated that it is dicult even to extract what they describe from a
manifest spacetime point of view. in fact, the exact (all orders in 1/k) metric,
dilaton etc, have only been obtained in a limited number of low-dimensional
cases (for a rewiew of such solutions, see refs.[6, 7]). and in most of these
cases, the physical spacetime properties have not really been extracted so far.
most studies of coset space gauged wzw models still restrict themselves to
lowest order in 1/k, and are thus essentially equivalent to the studies based
on the -function equations.

the purpose of the present paper is to show that interesting non-trivial

and non-singular cosmologies can be obtained from the cosets so(2, 1)/so(1, 1)

2

and so(2, 2)/so(2, 1). various aspects of string theory on these cosets have
been investigated in the literature, see for instance refs.[4]-[14]. cosmolog-
ical interpretations have been considered in refs.[12, 13, 15], but mostly to
lowest order in 1/k

the two dimensional coset so(2, 1)/so(1, 1), to all orders in 1/k, has
been given a cosmological interpretation in [13], but only in one of the coordi-
nate patches of the global manifold. in this paper, we consider all coordinate
patches and we shall show that the more interesting cosmologies actually
appear in the coordinate patches considered here.

as for the three dimensional coset so(2, 2)/so(2, 1), a cosmological in-
terpretation was attempted in [12], but only in certain coordinate patches
and only to rst order in 1/k. the cosmologies obtained in [12], however, are
completely changed in the exact theory. moreover, we show that the more
interesting cosmologies are obtained in other coordinate patches than those
considered in [12].

interestingly enough, quantum corrections not only cancel the semiclas-
sical singularities but also change the sign of the scalar curvature for oscil-
latory cosmologies, which is positive in the semiclassical regime (k  )
and becomes negative for the value of k dictated by conformal invariance.
in non-oscillating cosmologies the scalar curvature evolves from positive for
large and negatives times t to negative near t = 0.

the paper is organized as follows.

in section 2, we consider the two-
dimensional so(2, 1)/so(1, 1) coset. we rst re-analyse, in subsection 2.1,
the oscillating cosmology already considered in [13]. we point out the quan-
tum eects on the scalar curvature concerning the singularities and the sign.
we also compare with standard 1+1 anti-de sitter space. subsections 2.2
and 2.3 are devoted to the construction of non-singular non-oscillating cos-
mologies, obtained from other patches of the global manifold. both deation-
ary and inationary cosmologies are constructed. the corresponding scale
factors, hubble functions, string-couplings etc, are analysed in detail.
in
particular, we obtain a non-singular cosmology going through a de sitter-like
phase of ination.

in section 3, we consider the three-dimensional so(2, 2)/so(2, 1) coset.
starting from the highly non-trivial exact metric and dilaton [11], we rst
derive a relatively simple expression for the scalar curvature, showing that
all semi-classical curvature singularities have disappeared (but some new
quantum curvature singularities have appeared). this closely resembles the
situation in the two-dimensional case.
in subsection 3.1, we construct a
non-singular anisotropic oscillating cosmology. we analyse in some detail
the scale factors and the scalar curvature, but the string-coupling is unfor-
tunately not very well-behaved in this case. more interestingly, in subsec-
tion 3.2, we construct a non-singular non-oscillating anisotropic cosmology,
by considering a dierent coordinate patch (which actually belongs to the
so(3, 1)/so(2, 1) coset). one scale factor, in this case, experiences a phase
of inationary expansion while the other scale factor experiences deationary
contraction. moreover, during this phase, the string-coupling is completely
well-behaved. comparison of the two and three dimensional cases strongly

3

indicate that this latter cosmology is a model for the higher dimensional
so(d  1, 2)/so(d  1, 1) or so(d, 1)/so(d  1, 1) cosets.

finally, in section 4, we give our concluding remarks.

2 two-dimensional coset

the so(2, 1)/so(1, 1) metric and dilaton, to all orders in 1/k, are given by
[9]:

ds2 = 2(k  2)"

b  1
b + 1

.

where:

(2.1)

(2.2)

(2.3)

(2.4)

(2.5)

(2.6)

in these (b, x)-coordinates, the global manifold is

  < b < ,  < x <  .

the scalar curvature is given by:

r(b) =

4

k  2

k(k  4) + k(k  2)b
[k + 2 + (k  2)b]2

.

we see here the presence of new quantum curvature singularities at

b = 

k + 2
k  2

plus coordinate singularities (horizons) at b = 1.

in the semi-classical limit (k  ), the scalar curvature reduces to

r(b) k=

4
k

1

1 + b

comparison of (2.4) and (2.6) shows that in the the semi-classical limit the
quantum curvature singularities coalesce with the coordinate singularities
(horizons) at b = 1
the fact that the semi-classical curvature singularities become reduced
to coordinate singularities, and that new curvature singularities appear in
the exact (all orders in 1/k) theory, will turn out to hold also for the 3-
dimensional cosets, to be discussed in the next section.

for conformal invariance we demand that

c  so(2, 1)

so(1, 1)! = 26

(2.7)

leading to k = 9/4. thus the curvature singularity (2.6) is located at b =
17, that is to say, in the coordinate patch to the left of the left horizon

4

in the (b  x)-diagram. clearly, it is then possible to construct non-singular
spacetimes by considering the other coordinate patches. in the present case,
we are interested in constructing simple cosmological spacetimes, by which
we mean, spacetimes with signature (+) and line-element of the form

ds2 = dt2 + a2(t) dx2

(2.8)

where t plays the role of cosmic time, x is the spatial coordinate and a(t) is
the scale factor.

2.1 oscillating cosmology

considering the coordinate patch between the two horizons, |b|  1, and
using the parametrization b = cos 2t, we get the cosmology [13]

ds2 =

(t) = ln

the scalar curvature

r(t) = 72

4  cos2 t
(8 + cos2 t)2

is oscillating, nite and always negative

r(t)  [

(2.9)

(2.10)

(2.11)

(2.12)

it is an interesting observation that the quantum corrections not only cancel
the semi-classical curvature singularities, but also change the sign of the
scalar curvature, since semi-classically (k  )

r(t) 

4
k

1 + cos 2t

(2.13)

is always positive (and sometimes positive innity). we shall see in the next
section that this feature also holds in the 3-dimensional case.

there is a remarkable similarity between the cosmology (2.9) and ordinary

2-dimensional anti-de sitter spacetime

ds2

ads =

1

2 (cid:16)dt2 + sin2 t dx2(cid:17)

(2.14)

where the overall factor 1/2 is included for convenience. direct comparison
of the scale factors, hubble functions etc, reveals that there is almost no
dierence between the two cosmologies (2.9) and (2.14). the main dierence
is found in the scalar curvature, which is constant and negative for the anti-
de sitter cosmology (2.14), while it is oscillating and negative for the coset
cosmology (2.9) as we see from eq.(2.11).

5

finally we make a few comments about the dilaton (2.10). in the present

notation and conventions, the low-energy (k  ) eective action is

s = z dxz dt g e(cid:20)r + ()2 

1
12

hh  +

k

(2.15)

such that the string-coupling g is given by

gs = e/2 =

tan2 t 


(2.16)

up to an arbitrary positive multiplicative constant. it follows that we should
strictly speaking only trust the cosmological solution in the regions near t =
0, t = , t = 2 etc. that is to say, in the regions where the scale factor
gs is small. in the other regions where the scale factor is large, we should
expect that string-loop corrections will be important and possibly change
the solution dramatically. thus, concentrating on (say) the region around
t = 0, the line-element (2.9) describes a universe experiencing deationary
contraction (negative t) followed by deationary expansion (positive t). and
always with negative scalar curvature.

2.2 deationary cosmology

the oscillating cosmology (2.9) was obtained for the value k = 9/4, corre-
sponding to conformal invariance. however, using other values of k, it is
possible to construct other types of non-singular cosmologies. in that case,
conformal invariance must be ensured by adding other conformal eld theo-
ries. moreover, problems with unitarity will possibly appear in such cases.
in this subsection, we shall not deal with these problems, but instead concen-
trate on the possible cosmologies that can be obtained by keeping k arbitrary.
taking k = |k| < 0, we observe that the curvature singularity (2.6) is
located between the two horizons b = 1. it is then possible to construct non-
singular spacetimes by specializing to the two patches outside the horizons.
consider rst the patch b  1 using the parametrization b = cosh 2t. then
eqs.(2.1)-(2.3) become

ds2 = 2(2 + |k|)

dt2 +
(t) = ln cosh2 t s1 +

2
|k|

1 + 2

dx2
tanh2 t

|k| tanh2 t
tanh2 t ! + const.

(2.17)

(2.18)

notice that it is crucial to include the overall prefactor 2(k  2) in the line-
element to get the desired signature.

in this case the scalar curvature is given by

r(t) = 

2|k|
2 + |k|

(2 + |k|) cosh2 t + 1
[(2 + |k|) cosh2 t  2]2 ,

(2.19)

6

(2.20)

.

(2.21)

while the hubble function and its derivative become

h(t) =

a(t)
a(t)

=

(cosh2 t + 2

cosh t
|k| sinh2 t) sinh t

h(t) = |k|

(2 + |k|)(cosh2 t + sinh2 t) cosh2 t  2

[(2 + |k|) cosh2 t  2]2 sinh2 t

it follows that the universe has negative scalar curvature and it is always
deationary ( h < 0). more precisely, starting from at minkowski space
(t = ), the universe experiences deationary contraction until t = 0. still
deationary, it then expands and approaches at minkowski space again for
t  ; see figure 1.

the string-coupling in this case is given by

gs = e/2 =  cosh2 t s1 +

tanh2 t !1/2

2
|k|

(2.22)

which is always nite, and in fact goes to zero for t  ; see figure 2.
thus, this non-singular cosmology should be trusted everywhere.

2.3

inationary cosmology

a more interesting cosmology can be constructed by considering the patch
b  1 (and still k < 0) instead of b  1. using the parametrization
b =  cosh 2t, eqs.(2.1)-(2.3) become
ds2 = 2(2 + |k|)
dt2 +
(t) = ln sinh2 t s1 +
2
|k|

dx2
coth2 t

|k| coth2 t
coth2 t ! + const.

1 + 2

(2.23)

(2.24)

the scalar curvature is now given by

r(t) =

2|k|
2 + |k|

(2 + |k|) sinh2 t  1
[(2 + |k|) sinh2 t + 2]2 ,

while the hubble function and its derivative become

h(t) = 

(sinh2 t + 2

sinh t
|k| cosh2 t) cosh t

(2.25)

(2.26)

.

(2.27)

h(t) = |k|

(2 + |k|)(cosh2 t + sinh2 t) sinh2 t  2

[(2 + |k|) sinh2 t + 2]2 cosh2 t

now the situation is a little more complicated than in the b  1 patch.
however, notice that

r(t) > 0  cosh2 t >

3 + |k|
2 + |k|

7

(2.28)

as well as

h(t) > 0  cosh2 t >

1

4  3 +s1 +

16

2 + |k| !

(2.29)

thus the universe starts out as at minkowski space at t = . it then
experiences inationary ( h > 0) expansion with positive scalar curvature.
just before the scale factor reaches its maximal value at t = 0, the scalar
curvature becomes negative and the expansion becomes deationary. for
t > 0, the evolution is simply time-reversed; see figure 3.

it is particularly interesting that the universe is inationary ( h > 0)
with positive scalar curvature for (large) negative t. this suggests that the
universe goes through some kind of de sitter phase. this is conrmed by
expanding the scale factor for large negative t

a(t) = vuut

2 + |k|  1 +
|k|

2|k|
2 + |k|

e2t! ,

t << 0

(2.30)

thus there is in fact an element of exponential expansion.

finally, let us consider the string-coupling also in this case. it is given by

gs = e/2 =  sinh2 t s1 +

coth2 t !1/2

2
|k|

(2.31)

which is nite everywhere except near t = 0; see figure 4. in particular, the
string-coupling is nite during the phase of inationary expansion.

3 three-dimensional coset

the so(2, 2)/so(2, 1) metric and dilaton, to all orders in 1/k, are given by

(3.4)
in the (b, u, v)-coordinates, the global manifold for so(2, 2)/so(2, 1) is [10,
11]

b2 > 1
b2 < 1

and uv > 0
and uv < 0,

excluding

0 < v < u + 2 < 2

however, other regions in the (b, u, v)-space can be reached by going for
instance to the so(3, 1)/so(2, 1) coset, for which the metric and dilaton are
formally the same as above. for more details, see refs.[10, 11].

the general expression for the scalar curvature, corresponding to the
metric (3.3), is quite complicated. it is most conveniently written as a fourth
order polynomium in b divided by the square of a second order polynomium
in b:

r(b, u, v) =

k  2

4

c0 + c1b + c2b2 + c3b3 + c4b4

(d0 + d1b + d2b2)2

,

(3.5)

where the coecients ci and dj are functions of the remaining coordinates
(u, v) and the parameter k

ci = ci(u, v; k),
dj = dj(u, v; k),

i = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
j = 0, 1, 2

their explicit expressions are given in the appendix.

in the semi-classical limit (k  ), the scalar curvature reduces to

r(b, u, v) k=

4
k

3 + b2  v(b + 1)  u(b  1)

(v  u  2)(b2  1)

(3.6)

in agreement with ref.[10].

comparison of the semi-classical expression (3.6) and the exact expres-
sion (3.5) for the scalar curvature shows that all semi-classical curvature
singularities (b = 1, b = 1 and v = u + 2) have disappeared, but that new
quantum curvature singularities have appeared. the situation is thus com-
pletely analogous to the 2-dimensional case: the semi-classical curvature
singularities become coordinate singularities (horizons), but new quantum
curvature singularities have appeared elsewhere. the curvature singularities
in the exact geometry correspond to the zeroes of the denominator in (3.5),
which describe a surface in the (b, u, v)-space

"(1  b)2

the solutions of this equation precisely correspond to the singularities of the
function (b, u, v).

by considering dierent values of k, one can move the singularity surface
around in the global manifold. it is then possible, as in the 2-dimensional
case, to construct non-singular spacetimes by considering a single coordinate
patch. notice that for conformal invariance, we should demand that

c  so(2, 2)

so(2, 1)! = 26

(3.8)

leading to k = (39  513)/23.

3.1 oscillating cosmology

consider rst the case where k = (39+513)/23  2.48.. . it is then possible

to construct a cosmology in the coordinate patch

(3.13)

(3.14)

it is easy to see that this is a non-singular cosmology with t playing the role of
cosmic time, (x, y) are the spatial coordinates and the signature is (++), as
it should be. the fact that the cosmology is non-singular follows since, in the
coordinate patch (3.9) considered here and for k  2.48.., the equation (3.7)
has no real solutions since the left hand side is obviously negative while the
right hand side is positive. the cosmology is however somewhat complicated:

10

it is periodic in time, but non-homogeneous and highly non-isotropic. in fact,
the scale factors for the two spatial directions are oscillating with a phase
dierence of /2.

to gain a little more insight into this cosmology, we consider the region

near the spatial origin (x, y) = (0, 0). the scalar curvature reduces to

r(t, 0, 0) =

k  2

c0 + c2 cos2 2t + c4 cos4 2t

where the coecients (c0, c2, c4) are given by

c0 = k2h(k  1)1  13(k  1) + 6(k  1)2i
c2 = (k  2)2h2(k  1)1 + 4  30(k  1)  4(k  1)2i
c4 = (k  2)4h(k  1)1 + 2i

both of which oscillate between 0 and k  1  1.216.. with a phase dier-

ence of /2.

finally, let us return to the dilaton (for generic (t, x, y)). the string-

coupling is given by

(x2 + y2 + 1) cos2 t sin2 t

gs = e/2 = 


q(t, x, y)
= h(x2 + y2 + 1)| cos t sin t|i1/2

(k  1)(x2 + y2 + 1)

(3.24)

#1/4

thus the string-coupling blows up at t = 0, t = /2, t =  etc. it means
that we should only trust the solution in the intermediate regions where gs
is not large.

3.2 non-oscillating cosmologies

in the previous subsection we obtained an oscillating cosmology using the

value k = (39 + 513)/23  2.48.., corresponding to conformal invariance.

most formulas were however presented keeping k arbitrary, and the oscillating
cosmologies in fact exist for arbitrary k > 2. in this subsection we shall show
that it is possible to construct non-singular 3-dimensional non-oscillating cos-
mologies when k < 1. interestingly enough, the condition (3.8) of conformal

invariance gives rise to the possibility k = (39  513)/23  0.912.., but

in the following we just keep k arbitrary but less than 1. possible problems
with unitarity will not be dealt with here.

thus we take k < 1 and consider rst the patch

and use the parametrization

b  1,

u  0,

v  0

b = cosh 2t ,

u = 2x2 ,

v = 2y2 ,

(3.25)

(3.26)

actually the patch (3.25) is not part of the global manifold for so(2, 2)/so(2, 1),
so one has to go to the de sitter coset so(3, 1)/so(2, 1) instead [10, 11].
the general expressions for the metric and dilaton (3.1)-(3.4) are however
unchanged.

using the parametrization (3.26), the new metric and dilaton are

ds2 = 2(2  k)(cid:16)dt2 + gxx dx2 + gyy dy2 + 2 gxy dx dy(cid:17)

(3.27)

(t, x, y) = ln

(x2 + y2 + 1) cosh2 t sinh2 t

q(t, x, y)

+ const.

(3.28)

where now

gxx(t, x, y) =

gyy(t, x, y) =

(t, x, y)

(x2 + y2 + 1)2 "(x2 + y2 + 1) tanh2 t +
(x2 + y2 + 1)2 "(x2 + y2 + 1) coth2 t +

(t, x, y)

gxy(t, x, y) = 

(t, x, y)

(x2 + y2 + 1)2

and the function (t, x, y) is given by

xy
1  k

y2 + 1

1  k #
1  k #

x2 + 1

1(t, x, y) = 1 +

(1 + x2) tanh2 t + (1 + y2) coth2 t + (1  k)1

(1  k)(x2 + y2 + 1)

(3.29)

(3.30)

notice the similarity with eqs.(3.11)-(3.14): trigonometric functions became
hyperbolic functions and k  1 became 1 k. since we now consider the case
where k < 1, it is then clear that (3.27)-(3.30) describes a cosmology with
the correct signature ( + +). furthermore, it is easily seen from (3.7) that
the cosmology is non-singular. the change from trigonometric functions to
hyperbolic functions obviously has dramatic consequences. the cosmology
is however still non-isotropic and non-homogeneous, but it is no longer os-
cillating. in fact, the time-dependence of the metric actually disappears for
t  , i.e., the universe becomes static in these limits (however, the dila-
ton stays time-dependent). more precisely, both scale factors start out with
constant values at t = . then one of them increases monotonically to-
wards a maximal value, while the other one decreases monotonically to zero
for t  0. for t > 0, their behaviour is simply time-reversed.
as in the previous subsection, it is useful to consider in more detail the
region near the spatial origin (x, y) = (0, 0). the scalar curvature then
reduces to

r(t, 0, 0) = 

1
2  k

c0 + c2 cosh2 2t + c4 cosh4 2t
[k2  (2  k)2 cosh2 2t]2

,

(3.31)

with the coecients (c0, c2, c4) still given by (3.16). it follows that

r(, 0, 0) = (1  k)1 + 2

 (3  1)2  0.536..

r(0, 0, 0) = 3(1  k)1  2  (1  k)

(3.32)

(3.33)

< 1

2  k

2  k

where the numerical values were obtained using that k < 1. thus the scalar
curvature is either positive or negative (depending on the precise value of
k < 1) for large |t|, but always becomes negative for |t| close to zero.
scale factors analogous to (3.20)-(3.21). in the present case, one gets

as for the oscillating cosmology in the previous subsection, let us dene

a(t) = | sinh t|vuut
b(t) = cosh tvuut

(1  k) sinh2 t + cosh2 t

[(1  k) + (1  k)1 + 2] cosh2 t sinh2 t + 1

(1  k) cosh2 t + sinh2 t

[(1  k) + (1  k)1 + 2] cosh2 t sinh2 t + 1

(3.34)

(3.35)

13

see figure 5. it follows that

a(0) = 0, b(0) = 1  k, a() = b() = s 1  k
2  k

(3.36)

a careful analysis of the corresponding hubble functions and their derivatives
shows that for t << 0, one scale factor is contracting and deationary while
the other scale factor is expanding and inationary. this is most easily seen
from the expansions

a(t)  s 1  k
b(t)  s 1  k

2  k  1  2
2  k  1 + 2

1  k
2  k
1  k
2  k

and still taking into account that k < 1.

e2t! ,
e2t! ,

t << 0

(3.37)

t << 0

(3.38)

it is interesting that the scale factor a(t) is very similar to the scale
factor of the deationary 2-dimensional cosmology of subsection 2.2, while
the scale factor b(t) is very similar to the scale factor of the inationary
in particular, the scale factor
2-dimensional cosmology of subsection 2.3.
b(t) has en element of exponential expansion as seen from eq.(3.38).
in
that sense, the 2-dimensional coset comprises all the main features of the
3-dimensional coset.

the string-coupling in this case [generic (t, x, y)] is given by

gs = e/2 = 


(x2 + y2 + 1) cosh2 t sinh2 t

q(t, x, y)

1/2




= h(x2 + y2 + 1) cosh t | sinh t|i1/2

hcosh2 t sinh2 t

+

(1 + x2) sinh4 t + (1 + y2) cosh4 t + (1  k)1 cosh2 t sinh2 t

#1/4
which is nite everywhere except near t = 0. asymptotically (t  ) it
goes to zero; see figure 6. thus the solution should be trusted everywhere
except near t = 0.

(1  k)(x2 + y2 + 1)

(3.39)

it is also possible to construct a non-singular non-oscillating cosmology in
the patch

using the parametrization

b  1,

u  0,

v  0

b =  cosh 2t ,

u = 2x2 ,

v = 2y2 ,

(3.40)

(3.41)

and still taking k < 1 (also in this case one has to go to the de sitter coset
so(3, 1)/so(2, 2), see ref.[10, 11]). however, the resulting cosmology is
identical with the previous one, up to an interchange of x and y.

4 conclusions

the cosmological geometries found in this paper are exact conformal eld the-
ories. that is, they describe string vacua. physically, these are spacetimes
where the (massless) dilaton and gravitons elds are present. we nd that
such manifolds provide non-singular spacetimes with cosmological interpre-
tation. these are of two types: oscillating and non-oscillating cosmologies.
the non-oscillating metrics start as minkowski spacetimes for early times,
evolve through inationary expansion (with positive scalar curvature), then
pass through a deationary contraction ending as a minkowski spacetime for
late times.

all cosmological spacetimes from these cosets string vacua turn to be
anisotropic. this seems to be a general and unavoidable feature of string
vacua cosmologies. physically, this must be related to the masslessness of
the matter sources of these geometries. notice that de sitter spacetime
in general relativity is exactly isotropic and has a nonzero cosmological
constant as matter source.

the coset string cosmologies studied in this paper correspond to analo-
gies of de sitter spacetime in string vacua. in general relativity, the global
de sitter manifold describes a contracting phase (for t  0) and then an ex-
panding universe for t  0. only the expanding patch describes the physical
space. similarly, in string cosmologies one should not consider the physical
space as the whole global manifold but only a part of it. (the situation is
somehow analogous to the schwarzschild black hole in general relativity.
the global kruskal manifold describes a black hole and its mirror discon-
nected space; only half of the global manifold describes the physical space
[the exterior plus the interior of the black hole]).

it is a generic feature of coset string cosmologies that the inationary

expanding phase, when it appears, it does so for t < 0.

in both two and three dimensions, the coset cosmologies considered in
this paper are related to each other by combinations of simple translations
t  t + /2, analytic continuation t  it and changes of the level k. this
can be seen directly from the explicit expressions for the metric, dilaton and
string coupling, and follows more generally from the fact that the dierent
cosmologies correspond to dierent coordinate patches of the same global
manifold.
it was shown in refs.[8, 10] that the transformations relating
the dierent patches are generalized t-duality transformations, in the sense
that dierent patches arise from dierent gauge xings in the gauged wzw
construction. the dualities in question are thus generalizations of the well-
known dualities relating vector and axial gaugings in the two-dimensional
case [9].
