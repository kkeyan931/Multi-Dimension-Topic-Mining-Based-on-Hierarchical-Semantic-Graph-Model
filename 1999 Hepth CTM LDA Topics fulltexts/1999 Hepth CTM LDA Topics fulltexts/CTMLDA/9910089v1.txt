abstract. we present a theorem that determines the value of the wilson loop
associated with a nambu-goto action which generalizes the action of the ads5  s5
model. in particular we derive sucient conditions for conning behavior. we then
apply this theorem to various string models. we go beyond the classical string
picture by incorporating quadratic quantum uctuations. we show that the bosonic
determinant of dp branes with 16 supersymmetries yields a luscher term. we conrm
that the free energy associated with a bps conguration of a single quark is free
from divergences. we show that unlike for a string in at space time in the case of
ads5 s5 the fermionic determinant does not cancel the bosonic one. for a setup that
corresponds to a conning gauge theory the correction to the potential is attractive.
we determine the form of the wilson loop for actions that include non trivial b
eld. the issue of an exact determination of the value of the stringy wilson loop is
discussed.

1.

classical wilson loops - general results

wilson loops were derived from the nambu-goto action associated with the ads5  s5
supergravity[1][2] and from several other related actions[3]-[9] we introduce here a
space-time metric that unies all these models and determine the corresponding static
potential[10].

consider a 10d space-time metric

ds2 = g00(s)dt2 + gx||x||(s)dx2
||

+ gss(s)ds2 + gxt xt (s)dx2
t

(1)

where x|| are p space coordinates on a dp brane and s and xt are the transverse
coordinates. the corresponding nambu-goto action is

sn g =z ddqdet[xxg]

2

upon using  = t and  = x, where x is one of the x|| coordinates, the action for a
static conguration reduces to

sn g = t z dxpf 2(s(x)) + g2(s(x))(xs)2

where

f 2(s(x))  g00(s(x))gx||x||(s(x))

g2(s(x))  g00(s(x))gss(s(x))

(2)

and t is the time interval. the equation of motion (geodesic line)

l =z dx = 2z s1

pf 2(s)  f 2(s0)

the ng action and the corresponding energy e = sng
are divergent. the action is
t
renormalized by subtracting the quark masses[1]. for the ads5s5 case it is equivalent
to the procedure suggested by [11].

so that the renormalized quark anti-quark potential is

the behavior of the potential is determined by the following theorem[10].

theorem 1. let sn g be the ng action dened above, with functions f (s), g(s) such
that:

(i) f (s) is analytic for 0 < s < . at s = 0, ( we take here that the minimum of f
is at s = 0 ) its expansion is:

f (s) = f (0) + aksk + o(sk+1)

with k > 0 , ak > 0.

(ii) g(s) is smooth for 0 < s < . at s = 0, its expansion is:

g(s) = bjsj + o(sj+1)

with j > 1 , bj > 0.

3

(iii) f (s), g(s)  0 for 0  s < .
(iv) f(s) > 0 for 0 < s < .
(v) r  g(s)/f 2(s)ds < .
then for (large enough) l there will be an even geodesic line asymptoting from both
sides to s = , and x = l/2. the associated potential is

(i) if f (0) > 0, then

(a) if k = 2(j + 1),

(b) if k > 2(j + 1),

e = f (0)  l  2 + o((log l)el)

e = f (0)  l  2  d  l k+2(j+1)

where  =  k+2(j+1)

in particular, there is linear connement

in particular, there is no connement

a detailed proof of this theorem is given in [10]. as a consequence of this theorem
it is straightforward that a sucient condition for connement is if either of the two
conditions is obeyed:

(i) f has a minimum at smin and f (smin) 6= 0 or
(ii) g diverges at sdiv and f (sdiv) 6= 0.

3. quantum uctuations

so far we have discussed wilson loops from their correspondence to certain classical
string conguration. now we write down the machinery to incorporate quantum
uctuations and present some preliminary results about the qm determinant of some
of the classical setups discussed above [19].

we start with introducing quantum uctuations around the classical bosonic

conguration

the quantum corrections of the wilson line is

x(,  ) = x

cl(,  ) + (,  )

hwi = eecl(l)t z ya

da exp z d2xa

aoaa!

where a are the uctuations left after gauge xing. the corresponding free energy is

fb =  logz(2) = xa

log detoa

3.1. gauge xing

in the classical treatment it is convenient to choose for the worldsheet coordinates  = x0
and  = x.
in computing the quantum corrections it seems that there are several
equivalent gauge xings. one can still use the gauge of above, namely set x = 0, or
x  = u, u = 0 (we denote here s by u) so that there are no uctuations in the
space-time metric. however, it turns out that those gauges suer from singularities at
the minimum of the conguration u0. a gauge that is free from those singularities is the
normal coordinate gauge  = ucl and the uctuation in x, u plane is in the coordinate
normal to ucl.

3.2. general form of the bosonic determinant

bosonic uctuations in at space-time

let us recall rst the determinant in at space-time. the uctuations in this case are
determined by the following action

s(2) =

1

2z dd

the corresponding eigenvalues are

d2

xi=1 (cid:2)(i)2 + ( i)2(cid:3)

en,m = (

)2 + (

m
t

)2

and the free energy is given by



2

d  2

fb = logynm



2lxn

en,m = t

n + o(l)

regulating this result using riemann  function we nd that the quantum correction

to the linear quark anti-quark potential is

v (l) =  1

t fb = (d  2) 

24  1

l

which is the so-called luscher term[15].

3.4. general scalling relation, and the l dependence of v ?

consider an operator of the form

o[a, b] = a2ft(v)2

t + b2v(fv(v)v)

the correction to the potential v [a, b] due to uctuations determined by such an
operator is

for the operators that describe the uctuations associated with metrics such that

v [a, b] = (b/a)  v [1, 1]

f (u) = auk

g(u) = buj

(7)

like for instance for the dp brane solution in the near horizon limit we nd that
a2 = buj
therefore, the potential is proportional
to

 b/a = a

0 , b2 = a2

is of luscher

the fermionic uctuations in at space-time

the nsr action of the type ii superstring with a rr elds like on ads5  s5 is not
known. on the other hand the manifestly space-time supersymmetric green schwarz
action was written down for the ads5  s5 case[20] to demonstrate the use of the gs
action we start with the fermionic determinant in at space-time

the fermionic part of the  gauged xed gs-action is

7

sf lat

f = 2iz dd ii

where  is a weyl-majorana spinor, i are the so(1,9) gamma matrices, i, j = 1, 2 and
we explicitly considered a at classical string. thus the fermionic operator is

of = df = ii

the total free energy is

( of )2 =  = 2

x  2

t

f = 8 (cid:18)

1
2

log det  + log det df(cid:19) = 0

since for d=10, we have 8 transverse coordinates and 8 components of the unxed weyl-
majorana spinor. thus in at space-time the energy associated with the supersymmetric
string is not corrected by quantum uctuations.

3.6. the determinant for a free bps quark of ads5  s5
the  xed gs action[20]
is based on treating the target space as the coset
su(2, 2|4)/(so(1, 4)  so(5)). the action incorporates the coupling to the rr eld.
the square of the operator associated with the fermionic uctuations is

8  (cid:18)o2

 = 2

 + 2

42(cid:19)

the bosonic operators are of the form

3  [ox = 2
5  [o = 2

 + 2
 ]

2 ]

(8)
where {x0, x, u, }  {, x, 1
 , } and  is the coordinate on the s5 according to a
theorem of mckean and singer[22] the divergences of a laplacian type operator of the
form

 = 2 + x = 

1
g

da(gabgdb) + x

8
vanish if there is a match between the fermionic and bosonic coecients of 2 and x.
in the present case there are 8 bosonic and 8 fermionic 2 terms and hence there is no
quadratic divergences, and the coecients of x are 8 3/4 from the fermions and 3 2
from the bosons so there are also no logarithmic divergences. it is thus clear that the
divergent parts of the determinant associated with the supersymmetric uctuation of a
bps string quark vanish. this problem is related to issues associated with certain
bps soliton solutions[23].

3.7. the determinant for a wilson line of ads5  s5
the gs action was further simplied by using a particular  xing[21]

thus the transverse uctuations oxii are cancelled by the fermionic uctuations. we are
left with 6 fermionic degrees of freedom, the normal bosonic uctuation and 5 additional
bosonic uctuations associated with o. using our general result we know that the
quantum correction of the potential is of a luscher type. the universal coecient and

in particular its sign has not yet been determined. in [24] the bosonic and fermionic
determinants were analyzed in a dierent gauge xing procedure. it was found there
that the answer is not free from logarithmic divergences.

we see that the operators for transverse uctuations, oxii , ot, turn out to be simply
the laplacian in at spacetime, multiplied by overall factors, which are irrelevant.
therefore, the transverse uctuations yield the standard luscher term proportional
to 1/l. the longitudinal normal uctuations give rise to an operator on corresponding
to a scalar eld with mass 2ut /r2 = . such a eld contributes a yukawa like term

el
l

 

to the potential. thus, in the metric that corresponds to the pure ym case there are
7 luscher type modes and one massive mode. it can be shown that a similar behavior
occours in the general conning setup [19]. had the fermionic modes been those of
at space-time then the total coecient infront of the luscher term would have been a
repulsive culomb like potential[7] which contradicts gauge dynamics[25]. however the
point is that due to the rr ux the corresponding gs action cannot be that of a at
space-time.
indeed the fermionic uctuations also become massive so that the total
inteaction is attractive after all which is in accordnce with [8].

4. on the exact determination of wilson loops

[26] so far we have discussed the determination of wilson loops from the classical string
description and the way quantum uctuations modify the classical result. an interesting
question to address is whether in certain circomstances one can nd an exact expression
for the wilson loop. we start with a string in at space-time.

10

consider the bosonic string in at space-time with the boundary conditions

x i( = 0) = 0

x i( = ) = li

with lili = l2

the energy of the lowest tachyonic state is given by

e2 = p ipi + mtach

2 = (

li
2

)2 

(d  2)

24

1


so that[27]

for l >> (ts)1/2 this can be expanded to yield
(d  2)

 tstl  

24

e = tstlq1  (d2)

24

1

tstl2

1
l

+ ...

where the string tension t 1
st = 2. thus this expansion yields the luscher quadratic
uctuation term. moreover, this result is identical to the expression for the ng action
derived for a bosonic string in at space-time in the large d limit[28]

d  



24tstl2  0

d

24tstl2  f inite

it is straightforward to realize that for a static classical congurations ep oly = sn g.

a more challenging question is whether one can nd such exact solution for
a non-at spece-time. a naive conjecture is that for the ads5  s5 the result is
g2n
l q1 + cg2n
. however, whereas its large g2n expansion includes the lresult
 
of [1] and a non trivial luscher term, it does not permit a smooth extrapolation to the

weak coupling region where the potential behaves like   g2n
l .

4.1. wilson loops for string actions with wz term

in general exact results are known for non trivial backgrounds of group manifolds and
coset spaces. the sigma model associated with such target spaces is equipped with a
wz term the bosonic action is therefore

sb = sn g +z d2ex x b

for the case that the only non-trivial component of b is b01 = b(u) one nds

that for b 6= f ( f was dened in (2))
sn g+w z =z 

u0

du

g
f

f 2  b(f0 + b  b0)
pf 2  (f0 + b  b0)2

and

for the former case

sn g+w z = 0

f or b = f

11

s = (f0 + b0)l + 2z 

u0

du

g

fpf 2  (f0 + b  b0)2

for sting theories where f0 + b0, which is the value of b + f at the minimum of the
string conguration, does not vanish the wilson loop admits an area law behavior with
a string tension equal to f0 + b0.

in the string model associated with a three dimensional sl(2, r) group manifold,
r  r[29]. the b term match

and in the near extremal corresponding models of sl(2,r)
the f , namely f = b so that the wilson line is a straight line and th energy e = 0.
