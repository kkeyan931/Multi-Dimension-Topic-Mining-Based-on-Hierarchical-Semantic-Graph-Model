abstract

in this paper, we generalize a boundary state to the one incorporating non-
constant gauge eld strength as an external background coupled to the boundary
of a string worldsheet in bosonic string theory. this newly dened boundary state
satises generalized nonlinear boundary conditions with non-constant gauge eld
strength, and is brst invariant. the divergence immanent in this boundary state
coincide with the one calculated in a string  model. we extract the relevant
massless part of this generalized boundary state, and give a part of the d-brane
action with the non-constant gauge eld strength, that is, derivative corrections
to the d-brane action.

1 introduction

d-branes [1] are indispensable objects in string theories to the understanding of their non-

perturbative aspects, including various dualities [2]. one way to examine string dualities is to
use the d-brane action which is a low energy eective action of massless elds induced on the
d-brane [3]. for example, taking the worldvolume dual of the d1-brane action, we obtain a

nambu-goto string action with a tension rotated by sl(2, z) duality transformation which is
conjectured to exist in type iib superstring theory [4]. similar analyses have been performed
for other cases, such as dp-brane (2 p 4) actions or super-p-brane actions [4, 5]. as another
argument on string dualities using d-brane action we cite ref. [6], which shows that the bps

mass spectra given as a volume factor of the d-brane action describing compactied d-branes
are consistent with u-duality.

the d-brane actions used in the above analyses are the ones given by the lowest order

calculation in the string  model approach [7, 8, 9, 10], or in the open string partition function
approach [11], in addition to the ordinary scattering amplitude approach [12]. higher order

calculations of the d-brane actions have been known through the latter approaches [13], in
the trivial background of the massless sector of the closed string excitations (at metric and
no kalb-ramond two-form eld). this adds to the d-brane action higher derivative ()
corrections,1 which, however, may ruin the dualization procedure of refs. [4, 5].2 therefore, a
systematic framework which gives higher derivative corrections to the d-brane action is highly

desired.

since d-branes are dened as hypersurfaces on which the boundaries of the string world-

sheets can sit, the boundary states [17, 18, 19, 20, 21] describe the dynamics of the d-branes
well. a part of the d-brane action (more precisely, couplings to the elds of the closed string
excitations) is encoded in the boundary state [22]. however, this boundary state is dened as

an eigen state of the boundary conditions for the oscillating modes of the attached string, the
explicit form of the boundary state has been given only for simple backgrounds which give

linear boundary conditions. one of those congurations is the constant eld strength on the
d-brane. therefore, boundary states including general conguration of the boundary gauge

eld give us a method to calculate the higher derivative corrections to the d-brane action.

in ref. [23], a d-brane sector was introduced to the system of covariant closed bosonic

1 there are some arguments that the supersymmetry ensures the absence of correction terms to the d-brane

action [14].

2 t-duality for the bulk supergravity action can be extended to the one including the higher loop eects
(see ref. [15]). in other references, the higher derivative corrections to the d-brane action in the gravity sector
(especially, (curvature)2 terms) are calculated and its consistency with string dualities is checked [16].

1

string eld theory (sft) [24]. the d-brane action corresponds to the source term in this

sft, and the boundary state is a constituent of it. the dynamical degree of freedom of the
boundary state adopted there was only the constant eld strength. in this scheme of sft, a

 model gauge transformation was realized is such a way that it yields a constant shift of the
gauge eld strength in the boundary state.

in this paper, we present a generalized boundary state, which is constructed by a gauge
transformation in the sft.3 this boundary state incorporates the non-constant modes of
f(x) and gives the derivative corrections to the d-brane actions. our new boundary state
is dened for an arbitrary gauge eld conguration a(x), and we carry out the explicit
calculations up to the second order in the derivatives on f(x). this boundary state includes
divergences, and the requirement for these divergences to vanish gives a constraint on the
conguration of the gauge eld a(x). this constraint is shown to be identical with the
vanishing of the  function in a string  model, hence we regard this constraint as an equation

of motion for the gauge eld. after this regularization procedure for the boundary state, we
obtain the higher derivative corrections to the d-brane action, by extracting relevant parts in

the boundary state. it is expected that this generalized boundary state serves as an useful
tool for the investigation of the dualities or other dynamics in string theory.

the organization of the rest of this paper is as follows. in the next section, after sum-

marizing the properties of the boundary states adopted in ref. [23], this boundary state is
generalized to the one which has non-constant f(x) boundary coupling. in sec. 3, we study
the divergence immanent in the generalized boundary state, and see the coincidence with a
string  model. in sec. 4, using the new boundary state proposed in sec. 2, we calculate the

correction to the d-brane action. the nal section is devoted to our conclusion and discus-
sions. we include an appendix where the calculation of the formula appearing in this paper
is given.

2 generalizing the boundary state

as mentioned in the introduction, a certain sector of the boundary state is related to the low
energy eective action of d-branes [22]. the boundary state adopted in ref. [23] and in most

of the literatures has a single free parameter, that is, constant eld strength of the gauge eld

3we concentrate on the bosonic string theory in this paper. a work on supersymmetric extension will

appear soon [25].

2

on the d-brane.4 therefore the obtained eective action on the d-brane contains only the
constant eld strength. in this section, we generalize the boundary state so that it includes
non-constant modes of the eld strength, in order to calculate the corrections to the d-brane

action. these corrections correspond to the derivative corrections, since we expand the eld
strength by derivatives.

first let us summarize the relevant properties of the boundary state with the constant eld
strength. the boundary state |b(f )i is dened as an eigen state of the boundary conditions
for open bosonic strings [17, 18, 20]:

x i() |b(f )i = 0,
(p() + fx ())|b(f )i = 0,
c() |b(f )i = c() |b(f )i = 0.

(2.1)

(2.2)

(2.3)

the brst invariance of the boundary state is a consequence of eqs. (2.1)  (2.3). the
oscillator representation of |b(f )i reads

where

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)b(f )(xm , c0,e)e = n(f ) |bn(f )i  |bdi  |bghi ,
|bn(f )i = exp(cid:26)xn1

(2.9)

the orthogonal matrix o is dened as o 
 . although the front
factor n(f ) is arbitrary, this can be xed by various ways [22, 23, 26]. here we shall follow

 = (1  f ) 

ref. [23], where the gauge invariance principle for the d-brane (source) term in the closed sft
action has xed the front factor. only when the front factor is given by

n(f ) =

,

the boundary state is subject to the following sft gauge transformation:

4d-branes moving with a constant velocity or tilted by a constant angle are treated as a t-dual (or boosted)

version of the case with the constant eld strength [26, 27].

and we have dened the gauge transformation for the variable f as

(x) = x,

f =   .

for verifying the gauge transformation (2.9), we have used a relation on the  product

|  b(f )i = 

for the above  (2.10).

the gauge transformation for the closed string eld is given by

 = qb + 2  ,

(2.10)

(2.11)

(2.12)

(2.13)

(2.14)

therefore with the transformation parameter (2.10), the inhomogeneous part of the gauge
transformation (2.14) generates a shift of a component kalb-ramond gauge eld b(x) in 
by (x)  (x). (our notation of sft is given in ref. [23].) this fact is expected from
the gauge symmetry of the string  model, which is dened as (model)a(x) = (x) and
(model)b(x) = (x)  (x)[9]. note that in the string  model approach, this gauge
transformation (model) generates all the modes of the gauge eld a(x) on the boundary.
therefore, in order to generalize the boundary state to the one incorporating the functional
degree of freedom a(x) (or f(x)), it is natural to demand the following relation for the

new boundary state (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)b(cid:16)a(x)(cid:17)e :

 |bi = 2 |  bi .

(2.15)

in this relation the parameter string eld  is dened by (2.10) for an arbitrary function (x),
and the gauge transformation law concerning a(x) is

a(x) = (x).

(2.16)

since the gauge transformation (2.16) generates an arbitrary deformation of a(x) by the

parameter (x), (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)b(cid:16)a(x)(cid:17)e is obtained by integrating eq. (2.15). for this purpose we use

4

string functional  (the derivation is given in app. a):

the following formula for the star product (cid:16)(x)(cid:17) between the present  and an arbitrary
 2(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:16)(x)(cid:17)  e =(cid:26) i

z 2

d (x) ic(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)oscil.

this is a generalization of the identity (2.13). assuming that the ghost part of the new
boundary state is given by the same form (eq. (2.7)) as before, the second term on the rhs
of eq. (2.17) acting on the state |bi vanishes due to the ghost boundary condition (2.3). then
the desired generalized boundary state |bi is obtained by exponentiating the operator on the
rhs of (2.17):5

u[a]  exp(cid:18)i

(2.18)

(2.19)

note that u[a] and hence b has an invariance under the u(1) gauge transformation of a(x),
a  a + .

the new boundary state (2.18) is reduced to the previous one (2.4) when the dynamical

variable is restricted to the constant eld strength

a(x)  a(1)

 x , (cid:16)a(1)

  a(1)

(cid:17) = f,

since the neumann part of the previous boundary state (2.4) is written in a form

n(f ) |bn(f )i = exp(cid:18) i
= exp(cid:18)i

2i d x fx (cid:19)|bn(f = 0)i
 i d x a(x)(cid:19)|bn(f = 0)i .

(2.20)

(2.21)

(2.22)

our |bi satises various desired properties. one of them is the fact that it obeys the

following generalized nonlinear boundary condition

(cid:20)p + f(x)x (cid:21)|bi = 0,

where the eld strength f(x) is dened as usual:

(2.23)

(2.24)

f(x) = a(x)  a(x).

5 this denition is very natural in the sense of path-integral approach of string  model [18]. the boundary
state is regarded as an initial or nal wave functional for the path-integral. the rotational operator u [a] is a
path-integral weight exp(is()

the string  model action.

int ), where s()

this eigen equation (2.23) is easily proved from a property of the unitary operator u[a] (2.19):

u[a]pu[a]1 = p + f(x)x 

(2.25)

and p |b(f = 0)i = 0. the new boundary state |bi satises a generalized boundary condition
(2.23) which is in the same form required in the scheme of the string  model [8, 9, 18]. thus
also from this point of view it is possible to assert that this state |bi really describes a boundary
of a string worldsheet coupled to a massless gauge eld a(x).

one of the other properties of |bi is the brst invariance which is important to understand
loop-corrected equations of motion for closed string theory [18, 19]6. the brst charge can
be written in the form (see appendix a in the ref. [23] for its complete expression)

qb = 2i d(cid:26)ic hfunctions of pm and x ni  c pm x m(cid:27) + q(ghost)

b

,

(2.26)

where the term q(ghost)
the new boundary state |bighost is the same as the previous one |bghi, we have

consists only of the ghost coordinates. noting that the ghost part of

b

then the commutativity

c |bi = q(ghost)

b

|bi = 0.

(cid:20)px ,i dx a(x)(cid:21) = 0

ensures the brst invariance

qb |bi = 0.

(2.27)

(2.28)

(2.29)

although this boundary state |bi is a solution of the equation (2.29) for arbitrary cong-
uration of the gauge eld, this solution is formal, in a sense that the boundary state contains
divergence and thus is not well-dened unless regularized. in the next section we study on

this point in detail.

6in the closed sft, the d-brane action as well as the usual closed string eld action is implemented [23]
as s = 1
2 h|qb|i + h|bi , where we consider only the linearized part. the equation of motion follows as
qb |i +|bi = 0, hence multiplying qb on this expression we obtain a constraint qb |bi = 0. this constraint
of the brst invariance of the boundary state is also deduced from the gauge invariance of the whole sft
action[23].

3 divergence in the new boundary state

3.1 calculation of the divergence

the new boundary state (2.18) for a general (polynomial) a(x) is made of products of the
operators xs at the same point  and therefore it inevitably contains divergences. we shall

show in this subsection that these divergences can be absorbed into the redenition of the
gauge eld as ared
 (x)  a(x) + adivergent. we require that the divergent part adivergent to
vanish, in order to obtain a well-dened boundary state. eventually, constraint equation is

found to be identical with the vanishing of the  function of the string  model coupling. thus
this requirement of no-divergence coincides with the condition of the conformal invariance in

the string  model.

for studying the divergences in the new boundary state, we divide x () into the zero

mode and the non-zero mode part fx (),

and taylor-expand a (x()) around the zero mode x as

x () = x + fx (),

a(x) = a(x) + fx  a(x) +

2fx fx  a(x) +    .

1

we denote the contribution of the second term on the rhs of (3.2) to u[a] (2.19) by u0 and
that of the rest terms by v , and express u[a] as

(3.1)

(3.2)

(3.3)

(3.4)

(3.5)

u[a] = v u0.

u0 = exp(cid:18) i

2i d x x f(x)(cid:19)

explicitly, we have

and

v = 1 + i

3i d fx fx fx  f(x) + i
8i d fx fx fx fx  f(x)
2(cid:18)i
3 i d fx fx fx  f(x)(cid:19)2

+   

+

1

in (3.5) we have written explicitly only those terms where the total number of derivatives
acting on f(x) is at most two.

7

since the operator u0 acting on |b(f = 0)i generates the old boundary state (2.4) with

x-dependent eld strength (cf., eq. (2.21)),

the new boundary state (2.18) is expressed as

u0 |b(f = 0)i =(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)b(cid:16)f (x)(cid:17)e
|bi = v (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)b(cid:16)f (x)(cid:17)e .

(3.6)

(3.7)

note that the approximation to the rst order with respect to the derivative acting on the
eld strength, where v is put to be 1, does not reduce |bi to the previous (brst invariant)
boundary state |b(f )i considered in the ref. [23]. actually, the decomposition of u[a] into
u0v does not respect the brst invariance at each order in the expansion of v .

next, we shall evaluate the representation (3.7) by expressing it only by the creation

operators acting upon(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)b(cid:16)f (x)(cid:17)e. namely, we change all the annihilation operators in v into
the creation ones with use of the neumann boundary condition satised by (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)b(cid:16)f (x)(cid:17)e:

(3.8)

(cid:16)()
n + o 
where o(x) is an orthogonal matrix dened by
 (x)   1  f (x)
1 + f (x)! 
o 

 (x)(+)



n (cid:17)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)b(cid:16)f (x)(cid:17)e = 0,

, oot = oto = 1.

(3.9)

the calculation is straightforward and we here present only the results (see app. b for the
detailed calculation). the unitary operator v reexpressed in terms of creation operators
contains two kinds of divergences,

1 = (0) ,

xn=1

1
n

xn=1

= (1).

(3.10)

adopting the zeta function regularization, (0) = 1/2, we nd that the (1) divergence is
absorbed into the redenition of the eld strength f (x):

where the redened f red(x) containing the (1) divergence is given by

|bi =(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)b(f red(x))e +" creation operators

here we have kept only those terms written explicitly in eq. (3.5).7

the redenition (3.12) can be expressed in terms of gauge eld a as

(3.13)

for the generalized boundary state to be well-dened (not divergent), the coecient of the (1)
in eq. (3.13) should put equal to zero. therefore we obtain a constraint on the conguration

of the gauge eld

(a)  

1

1  f (x)2!

f(x) = 0.

(3.14)

at a glance one recognizes that this (a) is identical with the beta function for the gauge eld
coupling in the string  model [8]. hence the constraint (3.14) for the generalized boundary
state coincides with the conformal invariance condition in the string  model. we shall explain

the detailed correspondence between our formalism and the string  model approach in the
next subsection.

3.2 correspondence to the string  model  function

we have seen in the previous subsection that the divergences immanent in the newly dened
boundary state coincide with the result in the string  model. this feature is natural in a

sense that, in the both formalisms, one evaluates the same weight exp(cid:16)s()

5) on the boundary of the string worldsheet. however, two approaches appear to be clearly
dierent in the following respect: although the  model approach gives a loop contribution

int(cid:17) (see the footnote

to the gauge potential itself, the divergences in the boundary state show up in the form of
the redenition of the eld strength. in this subsection we study how the divergences in the

boundary state can be understood in the scheme of the string  model.

consider a string  model action [7, 8, 9]

s =

(3.15)

where the prime denotes the derivative with respect to a worldsheet coordinate . the bound-

ary of the worldsheet is put at  = 0, since we intend to study the correspondence with the

derivatives acting on f , since if the corrected action is written by gauge invariant eld strength f , the number
of indices should be even.

where the uctuation around the classical conguration is denoted as  and we have adopted
euclidean formalism, i   . in this expansion, we are working in slowly varying elds, i.e.
derivative expansion.

in the above equation (3.16), terms in the second line vanishes due to the equations of
motion for the classical conguration x. the terms in the third line gives a kinetic term
(propagator) for the scalar eld . this propagator depends on the constant eld strength

f on the boundary. usually in the string  model calculation [7, 8], one evaluates a vacuum
graph using the vertex in the fourth line by the contraction

i d ( x )f[ x] .

(3.17)

this quantity is in proportion to ( x), therefore the divergence of this one-loop vacuum graph
is interpreted as the one-loop divergent quantum contribution to the gauge eld a[x] in the

coupling h d ( x )a[ x] which appears in the rst line in eq. (3.16).

however, when we ignore the rst line and only consider the dynamics of the scalar eld
(,  ), it is natural to calculate the renormalization of the propagator, three point vertex, and

so on. let us concentrate on the one-loop correction to the propagator. using the couplings
in the fth line in eq. (3.16), at one-loop level we have two relevant feynman graphs shown in

fig. 1 and 2, which bring out divergences in the sector of the propagator. though generally
the divergence in the two-point function is absorbed into the renormalization factor of the

wave function, now according to the philosophy of the string  model, we expect that these
divergences can be absorbed into the redenition of the gauge eld strength in the propagator,

with the form (3.12).

we demonstrate here the calculation of the f divergences depicted in fig. 1. with use

comparing this result with the propagator in eq. (3.16), the one-loop divergence in the prop-

agator is absorbed into the redenition of the eld strength as

f red

(3.27)

this agrees with eq. (3.12), hence the divergences in the boundary state correspond to the
quantum loop divergence in the propagator in the string  model.

the exponent in the boundary state (2.4) consists of the quadratic combination of the
oscillators, therefore the boundary state respects the properties of the propagator in the string

 model. here we start from the single  model action (3.15) and expand it, hence it is plausible
that the divergences of both the propagator and the vacuum graph can be absorbed into the
same redenition of the gauge eld.

4 corrections to the d-brane action

having dened the boundary state (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)b(cid:16)a(x)(cid:17)e for an arbitrary conguration of the gauge

eld a(x), our next task in this section is to extract a particular part of the boundary state
which describes the interaction with the massless modes of the closed string. this contributes
to the corrections to the d-brane action.

as conrmed in ref. [23], the couplings between the gauge eld on the d-brane and the
closed string eld are described in terms of sft as h|b(f )i. thus this interaction (source
term) is naturally generalized to the one with non-constant eld strength:

h|bi =d|b(f red(x))e + h|" creation operators

with nite coecients #(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)b(cid:16)f (x)(cid:17)e .

(4.1)

here we have substituted the representation (3.11) of |bi, therefore now we adopt the approx-
imation considered in the previous section.

the rst term on the rhs of eq. (4.1) gives the same contribution to the part of the

d-brane action linear in the closed string massless elds, as the one obtained in the case of

12

the constant eld strength   b(f ) in ref. [23]. this is because, after putting the coecient
of the (1) term in eq. (3.13) to zero, then we see f red = f . the result is [23]

d|b(f red(x))e = tp

2 z dp+1x(cid:18) det(cid:16) + f (x)(cid:17)(cid:19)(0)

here h is the uctuation of the metric eld, b is the kalb-ramond two-form eld, and d
is the dilaton eld. the divergent (0) is regularized by the zeta-function regularization. the
resultant quantity (4.2) is a part of the well known d-brane action linear in the closed string
massless elds,8

the metric in this action is the string metric,9 which is related to the uctuation h of the
einstein metric through weyl rescaling as

g = e4d/(d2)( + h).

(4.4)

the second term in eq. (4.1) gives nite corrections to the d-brane action, that include two

derivatives acting on the eld strength f (x). in order for the bracket to be expressed in terms
of, for example, the massless component elds of the closed string, the oscillator contraction
should be performed. explicitly, the second term on the rhs of eq. (3.11) reads

8 the terms of higher powers in the closed string elds h , b and  which exist in the ordinary d-brane
action are expected to be reproduced by performing the integrations over the closed string massive modes.
note that thus we obtain a d-brane action of a form before integrating out the massive modes, i.e. we can
read couplings between the open string gauge eld strength f and closed string massive modes.

9 the metric eld in the d-brane action is dened by an induced one on the d-brane, and we have
investigated its dependence in ref. [23] by considering the tilt of the d-brane. we have seen the perfect
agreement with the string  model approach, in the case of the constant eld strength and the constant tilt
angle. further generalization on general deformation of the d-brane surface will be presented in our next
paper [25].

(4.6)

in (4.5) we have written explicitly only those terms which contain the closed string massless

modes, since these terms are necessary for the evaluation of the d-brane action. the omitted
part    in eq. (4.5) consists of an innite number of terms of massive excitations, such as
pl2 ()

l |0i or ()n |0i with n  3.

note that the boundary state for the constant eld strength b(f ) and the massless part
of the string eld state massless have even number of  oscillators. (we ignore the auxiliary
elds (denoted as bm (x) and em (x) in ref. [23]) in , since its bracket in eq. (4.1) vanishes
due to the contraction of the ghost oscillators.) thus contribution of the terms consisting of

odd number of  oscillators disappears. with the substitution of eq. (4.5), we nd that the
second term in eq. (4.1), which is the correction to the d-brane action, equals

5 conclusion and discussion

we have constructed a new boundary state which has the degrees of freedom of an arbitrary
conguration of the gauge eld a(x) on the d-brane. this state is dened by using the closed
sft gauge transformation acting on a conventional boundary state, inspired from the fact that
a gauge transformation of a string  model generates all modes of the gauge eld. the new

boundary state is brst invariant and surely satises the nonlinear boundary conditions with
the non-constant led strength.

the new boundary state includes divergences of the order (1) and (0). the (0) term
can be regularized by the ordinary zeta-function regularization method, whilst the intrinsic
divergence of (1) can be absorbed into the redenition of the gauge eld. this redenition

exactly coincides with the one-loop calculation for the gauge eld coupling in a string  model.

14

in order for the generalized boundary state to be well-dened, the divergent quantity should

vanish, hence this constraint forces the gauge eld to satisfy a dierential equation. this
equation is identical with the conformal invariance condition (a) = 0 derived in the string

 model approach. the origin of this coincidence is studied in the  model side, and we have
found that the divergences in the new boundary state can be identied with the one-loop
contribution to the worldsheet propagator in the string  model.

utilizing this boundary state, we have computed the derivative correction terms in the
d-brane action, by extracting the part corresponding to the massless excitations of the closed

string. after putting the divergence in the redened gauge eld to zero, we have obtained
couplings between the derivatives of the eld strength (f and (f )2) and the closed string
massless elds (h, b and d).

it might be possible to apply the procedure given in ref. [23] to obtain a gauge invariant
complete sft action. although this seems to be straightforward, we nd it actually compli-

cated. only with a naive extension of the method in ref. [23], there may not be corrected
born-infeld action whose variation under the sft gauge transformation cancels the surface
term stemming from the source term h|bi.

there still remains many subjects to be studied. in this paper we have argued the non-
constant mode of the eld strength on the d-brane, but it is more intrinsic to introduce massive

modes of the open strings. though the couplings to the massive modes of the closed strings
has been manifested in ref. [23], the boundary state contains innite number of product of
the gauge eld, which is a sign of the massive open strings. to construct more general state,

the sft gauge transformation will play an important role. the closed sft adopted in sec. 2
has been generalized to a open-closed mixed system [28], hence some correspondence between

our source term and open-closed coupling in ref. [28] may help to understand the boundary
state further. at least, the corrections (4.7) may be reproduced in the low energy sector of

the system of ref. [28].

one of the other subjects is concerning the supersymmetry. unfortunately, in the sft
scheme it is hard to discuss the supersymmetry because of some schematic problems [29].

a lot of interesting aspects of d-branes are on the basis of the supersymmetry. we expect
that the denition of the new boundary state given in this paper can be generalized to the

supersymmetric one. this sort of generalization is seen in ref. [18], in which the case of
constant eld strength was treated. with use of the generalized supersymmetric boundary

state, one can calculate corrections to the d-brane actions in the superstring case as well as
various interesting quantities [25].

appendix
a calculation of the  product for an arbitrary (x)

in order to view the meaning of the unitary rotational operator u[a], it is important to check
that the denition (2.18) really follows from a gauge rotation ( product) in sft. what should
be checked is

|bi = |b(f = 0)i  2(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:16)a(x)(cid:17)  b(f = 0)e

(a.1)

for an innitesimal a(x) (as a parameter in the ), instead of the previous (x). it is needed
only to trace the app. b of ref. [23], for (x) with arbitrary powers in x. we will present only
the summary of the calculation. in this case we should take into consideration the fp2 term
(eq. (b.6) in [23])

exp fp2 = exp

in the three string vertex operator v123. this fp2 factor is quadratic in p, thus when treating
 linear in x (= i 
p ) as in [23] its contribution disappears. but for higher powers in x,

the logarithmic divergence log(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) 

ordering divergences of the xs in (x), but its nite part remains ambiguous. for example,
the gauge transformation parameter

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) comes out. this divergences are absorbed into the normal

where c is a nite unknown constant (contractions of  comes from the at metric  in
eq. (a.2)).

in this paper we assume that c = 0, since if we dene |bi with non-zero c using the above
eq. (a.4), the generalized nonlinear boundary condition (2.23) does not follow. after all,
together with the above results and the denitions (2.15) (2.18), the gauge transformation of
the dynamical variable a(x) of the new boundary state |bi generated by the sft  product
is (2.16), for an arbitrary number of powers in x.

b calculation of the divergence in the boundary state

in this appendix we present the calculation to obtain eq. (3.11), changing all the oscillators
into creation operators using the boundary condition (3.8). we show here the calculation of
only the last term in eq. (3.5), since this term is the most bothersome and other terms can be

evaluated in the same way. considering the corresponding mode of the gauge eld

a(x) = xx,

with  = ,

(b.1)

the last term in eq. (3.5) is written as

this is evaluated on the boundary state (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)b(cid:16)f (x)(cid:17)e. after changing all the oscillators into

creation operators, then we are led to the following form symbolically:

(b.3)

on the rhs, the rst two terms have nite coecients and furthermore are not relevant for
the massless modes in the closed string excitations, hence it is not necessary to evaluate them

explicitly. the third term quadratic in  and the last constant term c contain divergences and

17

also nite contributions. the ()2 term is given as

here other summations denotes the summation in the other four regions in the (m, n)-plane
divided by three lines: m = 0, n = 0, m+n = 0. the other summation is performed in the same
manner with slight changes of the indices. from this expression we can extract the divergences
(1). for example, from the rst summation we have

where we have dened en  n + m. this is because, in this case we should sum over en as the
index of the oscillators, and for a xed en, divergent quantities proportional to (1) stem from
the rst and the second terms in the rst summation in eq. (b.4) (the factor of the third term
2/nm does not give the divergence). in the same way, one nds that the second summation
in eq. (b.4) does not bring about the divergence. collecting all the divergent terms, we can
verify the following equality:

divergent terms of ()2 = |bn(f + f )i  |bn(f )i
