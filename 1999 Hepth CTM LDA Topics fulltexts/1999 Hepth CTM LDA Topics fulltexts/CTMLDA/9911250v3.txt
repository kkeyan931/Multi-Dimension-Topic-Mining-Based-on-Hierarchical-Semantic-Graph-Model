abstract

in general relativity and electrodynamics elds are always generated from static
monopoles (like mass or electric charge) or their corresponding currents by surround-
ing them in a spherical conguration. we investigate a generation of elds from pri-
mary elds by a scalar coupling. the generated secondary elds fulll the condition of
source-freedom and therefore cannot occur in a spherical conguration. the coupling
strength depends on the energies of the primary elds. in most cases these elds can be
approximately considered as dipole elds. we discuss two applications of couplings for
electromagnetic and gravitational spin-1 elds and for electric and magnetic elds. we
calculate for both applications the threshold values of eld energy for the maximum
coupling strength.
the proposed approach yields to a further step towards an unication of electromag-
netism and gravitation and has important consequences for the discrete symmetries.

1 introduction

the classical eld theory describes the two long ranging elds of electromagnetism and grav-
itation. some investigations were made to nd a common formalism for unication of these
elds and interactions [1], even to nd a connection between gravitation and quantum theory
[2], but no convincing conception was found [3]. (for a survey see also [4]).
extended theories of gravitation based on supersymmetry predict new particles. these quan-
tum theories of gravitation contain not only the spin-2 graviton, but include also spin-0 and
spin-1 gravitons (graviscalar and graviphoton) as well as spin-3/2 gravitino for the descrip-
tion of gravitational interactions [5].
composite models of particles provide an alternative approach for gravitational interactions.
the interaction-particles (bosons) are described as composite states of the fermions [6].

thus the spin-2 graviton can be considered as a bound state of two spin-1 gravitons [7].
this bounded state should be resulted by the coupling to itself and should also generate the
self-interactions, which are described by the nonlinear equations of general relativity. this
non-linearity results from the fact that the spin-2 graviton couples to everything and thereby
also to itself.
within the covariant formalism of general relativity, the gravitational eld can be described
as a pure vectoreld in an approximation for weak elds, where self-interactions must be
neglected. in the case of a non-approximate description of vectorelds the self-interactions
must be removed completely. thus unlike the spin-2 gravitons, the spin-1 gravitons as also
the photons are no sources of themselves, for which no self-interactions results.
this means that the spin-1 graviton couples to everything but not to itself, which requires
a certain symmetry for the gravitational vectoreld. this is also shown by linear eld equa-
tions and the appearance of local conservation laws. therefore the gravitational vectoreld
has the property of a sourcefree eld and cannot occur in a spherosymmetrical conguration.
the coupling to other (non-gravitational) interactions with the break of the spherical sym-
metry should generate spin-1 gravitons.
therefore, it should be possible to discuss the spin-1 graviton (graviphoton) and the classical
vector eld of gravitation together with the photon and the classical electromagnetic eld
within a common formalism of the linear maxwell equations. although the spin-2 gravitons
cannot be described within the linear formalism [8], this represents a further step towards
the unication of electromagnetic and gravitational interactions.
the gravitational elds are described by nonlinear equations in general relativity. their
nonlinearity structure is caused by the self-interaction. if we assume that mass and all forms
of energy are gravitational charges, only one kind of gravitational charge can exist. so there
is no mechanism to generate dipole elds like in electrodynamics, where two kinds of charge
are possible.
we conclude that gravitational dipole elds can exist, but they have to be source-free (no
kind of charge like mass or electric charge). linear eld equations like the homogeneous
maxwell equations describe exactly those source-free gravitational elds.
from a counterpart view between sources and elds (p. 368 e. of [9]) the priority of the
elds should be preferably considered. we can have elds without any source but no source
without any eld. the source results from a spherical conguration of the eld. thus, charge
or mass and also all forms of energy as sources are built from elds and the conservation
of the sources is the consequence of this construction.
based on these assumptions we present two applications, where secondary elds can be gen-
erated from primary elds. the source-freedom of these secondary elds is an important
condition, which prohibits a spherical conguration. thus, spherosymmetrical solutions of
the secondary elds (like monopoles) are excluded. in consideration of source-freedom we
show that this scalar coupling factor depends on the value of the primary eld energy. at
the point of maximum coupling strength, the strength of the interactions caused from both
primary and secondary elds must be equal. so the secondary elds can only have either
less or equal energy than the primary elds. thus, we have to calculate the values of eld
energy for the point of maximum coupling strength.
this paper is organized as follows:
in section 2 we see that the consideration of source-free gravitational elds yields to a de-

2

scription by linear eld equations. in sec.3 we show that the condition of source-freedom
leads to scalar coupling coecients, which depend on the square of the eld energy of the
primary eld. in sec.4 we present the couplings between primary and secondary elds within
two applications. the interactions of primary and secondary elds are discussed in sec.5.
we determine the value of the maximum coupling strength and their values of eld energy
in sec.6. in sec.7 we discuss the break of the discrete symmetries of parity, time reversal and
charge conjugation. section 8 contains the conclusions.

2 source-free gravitational elds

the mathematical description of gravitational elds is given by einsteins eld equations,
which contains two contracted forms of the riemann-christoel curvature tensor, the ricci
tensor and the curvature scalar.
gravitional elds can be compensated locally by the transition to an accelerated coordinate
system but the global eld remains, because of the christoel symbols are transformed in a
non-linear way. the local compensation of the gravitational elds is the result of the equiv-
alence principle.
for weak elds we can use a linear approximation by neglecting the self-interaction. some
components of the christoel symbols vanish and the covariant derivatives are reduced to
partial ones so the remaining equations receive a linear structure like the maxwell equations
in electrodynamics.
further we can derive the newtonian approximation and equations, which describe gravito-
magnetic elds (p. 197-205 of [10]) as a result from the thirring-lense eect [11].
these linear equations are valid only as an approximation for weak gravitational elds and
constant velocities but not for accelerated coordinate systems.
to acquire attractive forces among the same kind of charge, we have to set negative signs
at the sources in the linear equations of the vector elds. therefore, we receive negative
densities of energy and the transition to accelerated coordinate systems becomes impossible.
this diculty from negative signs only occurs for a vector theory of gravitation [12]. the
transition to the covariant formalism also has its diculties especially at the localization of
the gravitational eld energy (p. 139 eq.(21.6) of [10] and p. 466-468 of [9]).
for a vector theory of gravitation we can avoid these diculties only by homogeneous eld
equations, describing elds without any sources. in this case the linear eld equations are
exactly valid not only approximately.
the remaining specic components  describing the gravitational vectoreld are transformed
by linear transformations like a tensor, because the second term vanishes:


 =

x
x

x
x

x
x



 

(1)

the fact that these components representing the gravitational vectoreld obey linear trans-
formations causes the vanishing of the following term:






  




 = 0

(2)

3

thus, the riemann-christoel curvature tensor of these components is reduced to the linear
form:

r

 =



 
x 

 

x

(3)

here, the vanishing riemann-christoel curvature tensor is not only a criterion for acceler-
ated coordinate systems, but here also characterizes the homogeneous part of a gravitational
eld.
the possibility of dierent signs of the linear curvature tensor yields to the fact that the
contraction of this curvature tensor has to vanish.

r =



 
x = 

1
2

2g = 0

by the linear eld equations follows the additional constraint:


 =

g
x = 0

1
g

therefore, the determinant of the specic metric tensor remains unchanged:

g =  det g = 1

(4)

(5)

(6)

thus, we receive as contributions to the metric tensor g only diagonal elements and we
always obtain two invariant remaining spatial components by the source-freedom constraint:

g = diag (cid:18)1 

2u

c2 (cid:19) ,  1
1  2u
c2
2 |h00|

u = |~g~x| =

c2 ! ,1,1!

(7)

(8)

from the specic form of g results no contribution to the christoel symbols. these spe-
cic properties of the gravitational vector eld allows the expression of the specic christoel
symbols by an antisymmetric eld strength tensor and a vector potential similar to electro-
dynamics. by the transition from covariant derivatives to the partial ones the connections
between eld strength tensors and vector potentials are the same. (p. 106 eq.(4.7.2), and p.
108 eq.(4.7.11) of [13]).
(hence the g stands for any metric tensor.) with the four-velocity u = (c, ~v) and
uu = c2, we receive the following relations for the vector potential and the eld strength
components:

(9)

(10)

(11)

considering these vector elds described by linear eld equations, we arrive at two results
within a common formalism. in both cases no self-interaction remains and the equations

have an exact linear structure for all applications:
-the eld is not a gravitational eld, it can be described by the inhomogeneous maxwell
equations.
in this case two kind of charges might exist and we receive the equations of
electrodynamics.
-the eld is a gravitational eld, therefore it must be source-free and we obtain with the
lorentz-gauge:

f 
[g]
x = 2a

[g] = 2h0 = 0

(12)

(13)

we obtain for the metrical representation by the invariant line element:

ds2 = (cid:18)1 

2u

c2 (cid:19) c2dt2 +  1
1  2u

c2 ! dx2  dy2  dz2 + 2h0dxcdt

unlike in general relativity we obtain a local conservation of energy and momentum of the
source-free gravitational elds, because energy and momentum can be localized and these
elds are transformed in a linear way.
the gravitational vector eld couples to the current density of energy and momentum:

for the interaction of the vector eld we obtain by the local conservation law:

j
[m] =


c2 ut 

t 
x = 

t  = f 

[g] j[m]



(14)

(15)

the following eects occur with the source-free gravitational elds as well as with the grav-
itational elds in general relativity:
-the gravitational red- and blue shift of spectral lines.
-the deection of light.
-the time delay of signals and scale contraction.
-the precession of a gyroscope.
thus, these source-free gravitational elds are able to exert forces on all masses and forms
of energy but cannot be generated by themselves.
especially for the case of dipole elds we see that the conservation of the centre of gravity
also requires a vanishing gravitational dipole moment (p. 975 of [9]).
therefore, gravitational dipole radiation (spin-1 graviton or graviphoton) cannot have sources
from mass or energy.

3 the source-free generation of elds

in all discussed cases the electric or magnetic elds are the only components of the primary
eld [e], while [s] stands for any secondary eld. we set for the eld strength tensors:

with: f 
by considering the source-freedom of the secondary eld we receive:

[e] = primary eld. f 

[s] = secondary eld. k = scalar coupling coecient.

[s] = f

(17)

for the vector potentials we receive the following conditions:

[e]  k  a
and obtain with the lorentz-condition for a

[s] = a

[e]

[e]  2k = 0

[e] 
for the symmetric energy-momentum tensor:

[e] +

4

[e](cid:19)
gf[e]f 

t 
[s] = t

the divergence-free energy-momentum tensor results from the source-freedom of the sec-
ondary eld:

t 
[s]
x = k 
with the electric current density follows:

we can also receive the last two equations by using the covariant divergence, because the
covariant derivatives and partial derivatives are the same for the scalar coupling coecients.
the electric current density is calculated from the covariant divergence of the electromagnetic
eld strength tensor.
for a stationary consideration we look at the spatial components, which characterize the local
behaviour of the scalar coupling factor related to the local variation of the eld strength and
the energy density:

2~k  e2 = k  [e]  ~e
2~k  b2 = k (cid:16)~j[e]  ~b(cid:17)

here we can see that in the inhomogeneous part of the eld (near the charge and current
densities) the coupling coecient decreases, which means a local decoupling of the elds.
however, the coupling coecient reach a local maximum in the homogeneous part of the
eld.
hitherto, only the local variation was considered. however, this gives no information about

6

the absolute value of the coupling strength concerning the hole eld volume. for calculating
the general variation of the coupling strength, we integrate over the eld volume:

zv

k

t 
[e] 

k

x! dv = zv

 t 
x ! dv = 0

[e]

(30)

we can see after the volume integration that all local variations of the coupling coecient
as well as of the energy density of the eld vanish if the eld energy is conserved.

[e]

  t 
x ! dv = zv =

zv

t 
[e] d

(31)

the right-hand side of the previous equation shows the equivalent integration over the sur-
rounding surface of the volume:

this shows that the general variation of the coupling strength must have a dependency from
the eld energy.
the general variation k
primary eld:
t 
w 
[e] dv

x of the coupling strength can be expressed by the energy of the

[e] = rv

w 
[e]
x =

k

(32)

it is seen from this equation that an increasing eld energy provides an increasing coupling
strength. this equation describes only the relation between the coupling strength k and
the primary eld energy w 
[e] without any interactions of sources like mass or charge. these
interactions are discussed in section 5.
we have to include that our scalar coupling coecient k must be a lorentz scalar and
is therefore only dependent from lorentz invariant values. we can receive for the elds
a similar relativistic energy-momentum equation, from which a lorentz scalar is achieved.
this results by the product of the covariant tensor t  with its contravariant counterpart
(p. 609 of [14]).
however, in general the volume integration w 

t 
[e] dv cancels the lorentz invariance
of the resulted scalar. to restore the lorentz invariance the volume integration must be
restricted to the rest frame of the eld.
by the following relation:

[e] = rv

p pc2 = w 2

f  p2c2 = m2

0c4 = (cid:18)1

[e] w[e]

with the corresponding eld values:

0c2 (cid:16) ~e  ~b(cid:17) dv

(33)

(34)

(35)

the lorentz scalar of the eld follows as a rest mass m0, which is not a xed value but only
depends on the eld strength and the volume of the eld within the rest frame.
the possibility of the denition of a eld rest frame is connected with the timelike property
of the 4-vector p , which is expressed by the following condition:

p p  0

(36)

for elds with spherical symmetry this condition is not strictly uphold. also any inuence of
the secondary elds in a spherical conguration is cancelled, which prohibits a determination
of a lorentz invariant coupling coecient k.
the homogeneous part of the eld can be considered as a eld rest frame by the fact that
there the coupling coecient k reaches its local maximum.
for the rest frame of the eld, expressed by the rest mass (m0  0), we can have two dierent
cases for the primary eld:
case a (a eld of stationary charge distributions):
we only have a eld of stationary charges therefore, only a pure electric eld exists. so the
rest mass of the primary eld is represented by the electric eld only.

m0 (e, v ) =

1

c2 zv

1

20   e2

c2 ! dv

(37)

case b (a eld of stationary current distributions):
we only have a eld of constant currents therefore, only a pure magnetic eld exists. the
rest mass of the primary eld is represented by the magnetic eld only.

m0 (b, v ) =

1

c2 zv

1

20 (cid:16)b2(cid:17) dv

(38)

only a pure electric or a pure magnetic eld can be considered as a primary eld, for
a generation of a coupled secondary eld. so the value of the scalar coupling coecient
depends on the value of the lorentz invariant square of the specic eld energy of electric
or magnetic eld, but never on both of them within the same case.
we see that these applications of couplings are not possible in the direct way for radiation
elds, because real photons have no rest mass.

p p = h2 2

c2  k2! = 0

(39)

the condition p p 6= 0 is only valid for virtual particles like electric (coulomb-) photons
and magnetic photons, which are o-mass-shell photons. thus, any conceivable coupling
between electromagnetic dipole radiation and gravitational dipole radiation is generated by
the oscillating primary and secondary elds itself and cannot be generated in the direct way
as in the case between primary and secondary elds.
we receive for the lorentz invariant terms of the eld:

k
x =

k

(cid:16)w

(40)

for this dierential equation we need a special nontrivial solution with the property:
dk  k and the boundary conditions: k(w[e] = 0) = 0 and k(w[e] = w0) = k0.
hence, no special derivation variable is necessary:

4(w 2

the coupling of the source-free gravitational eld with the electromagnetic eld.
we set for the eld strength tensors:

written in components of the elds:

f 
[g] = f 

[e]  k[e]

~e  k[e] = ~g
~b  k[e] = ~

(cid:16) ~b  k[v](cid:17)  k[e] = ~g

(50)

(51)

4.3 the directions of the primary and secondary eld compo-

nents

for the linear coupling of the eld components we can have two directions either the parallel
or the opposite parallel direction.
from this fact results that the interaction forces of the primary and secondary eld can be
either added or subtracted dependending on the sign of the charges.
to nd the right direction (both directions within the same case are impossible!), we con-
sider the qualities of the electrically charged particles concerning the interactions within the
coupled elds.
for the electro-gravitational coupling we nd that in the case of the coupling along the anti-
parallel direction, the negative charged particles show additive forces and positive charged
particles show subtractive forces. to transfer the momentum and energy from primary to the
secondary eld the forces generated by the two coupled elds must have the same direction.
this is fullled in this case by the negative charged particles. we observe this fact in the
most materials, the momentum and energy of the electromagnetic current is indeed mostly
carried by negative charged particles especially by the electrons. thus, the consideration of
the coupling along the anti-parallel direction is justied here.
for the coupling between electric and magnetic elds these considerations are more dicult
here; no transfer like in the aforementioned approach occurs in a direct way, because there
is no magnetic charge. in the coupled electric and magnetic elds the electrically charged
particles move along the direction of the electric eld and their magnetic moments are ori-
ented along the direction of the magnetic eld. a determined direction of the coupling
between these two elds, causes a break of the symmetry between left-handed and right-
handed particles. an example of a break of the left-right symmetry occurs within the weak
interaction, which prefers the left-handed particles. according to the preference of the left-
handed particles, the consideration of the coupling along the antiparallel direction is justied.

4.4 the coupling strength of both applications

the equations of the coupling coecients have the same structure for both applications. the
only dierence is within the coupling coecients and the specifc energy values:

k[e] = kq  exp

10

(52)

k[v] = kc  exp

1 

w 2
eb

[e]







(53)

the strength of the maximum coupling remain constant if the eld energy exceeds the values
of weg or web.
the upper boundary of the coupling coecients kq, kc as well as the threshold values of the
eld energies weg, web, will be calculated in section 6.

5 the interactions of the elds

the source-free secondary elds are characterized as free elds. therefore, the interaction
terms cannot be calculated directly because of the vanishing eld divergence, which results
from the source-freedom constraint. to calculate these interactions, we determine the la-
grangian of primary elds and include all interactions, which result from both (primary and
secondary) elds.
this means that the energy of interaction of the secondary elds is transferred from the pri-
mary elds. the inclusion of all interactions modies the current density in the lagrangian.
with c2j
[m] = ut  as a current density of energy and momentum and a possible mag-
netic current density j
[e], we receive for the complete
lagrangian:

[b] and the primary current density j

with the currents:

l =

f[e]f 

[e]  j

[e,m,b]a[e]

j
[e,m,b] = j

[e] + j

[m]  k[e] + j

[b]  0  k[v]

we obtain from the euler-lagrange equations of the elds:

f 
[e]
x = 0  j

[e,m,b]

(54)

(55)

(56)

(57)

(58)

(59)

and determine for each term describing the specic interaction of the elds and currents:

[e]  j[e]

t 
[e]
x = f 
t 
[g]
x = f 
t 
[b]
x = f 

[e]  j[m]  k[e]

[e]  j[b]  0  k[v]

we obtain an energy balance equation as a local conservation law by summing up these
interaction terms together with the divergence of the energy density of the primary eld
and integrating over the volume. however, the coupling strength must remain at a constant
value.
as we have shown in sec.3 a volume integration is necessary to include the general variation of

11

the coupling strength k. together with the interactions of the elds within each application
we obtain as a local conservation:

t 
[e]

x =   2
x =   2

(60)

(61)

the variation of the eld energy is on the left-hand side of the equation. one the right-hand
side we have the variation of the coupling strength and the terms of the interactions.
the primary eld strength tensor satises the wave equation of the elds:


x

f 
[e]
x = 0

thus we receive from the lagrange equations:

with the following condition for all currents:

[e,m,b]

x = 0

j 

k
x =   u 

k
x = 0

j
x = 0

(62)

(63)

(64)

(65)

therefore follows the local conservation for each current and we obtain generally with each
coupling coecient:

this relation can be veried by the energy dependence relation of the coupling coecients.
(we would obtain the same results by the covariant derivatives, because w and k are
scalars.)
we set for the derivation of k:

from which results:

the fact that w depends only on the eld values of the e- or the b- eld and on the eld

from the conservation of the electric current follows the charge conservation and from the
conservation of the mass current follows the conservation of energy and momentum. thus,
any discussed interaction of primary and secondary elds is only possible with these conserved
currents.
the spatial and time components of the four-force of mass and electric charge including both
coupling coecients are described by the following relations:
(m = m0)

(cid:16)m  k[e]  qe(cid:17)  (cid:16) ~e + ~v  ~b(cid:17)  k[v]   ~b

(71)

(cid:16)m  k[e]  qe(cid:17) (cid:16) ~e  k[v]  ~b(cid:17)  ~v = p

for a concluding remark, we note for the calculation of multipole moments that for the
secondary elds the monopole moment vanishes (because of the source-freedom). thus, all
multipole expansions begin with the dipole moment as the leading term. all higher multipole
moments of the secondary elds are composed of dipole moments generated from those elds.

6 the maximum strength of the couplings and their

corresponding values of eld energies

the main criterion for the maximum strength of the couplings is the equal strength of
both interactions from the primary eld as well as from the secondary eld. this criterion
characterizes the maximum values of the coupling coecients and is justied by the energy
conservation between primary and secondary elds.
for the coupling between electromagnetic and gravitational elds we determine the relation
between the quantities of the electric charge and the rest mass of the lightest particles. the
energy of the electric eld surrounding that electric charge can be expressed as the rest mass
of the electric charge.
in spite of the impossibility to calculate these values from the classical eld theory, this
relation of quantities between charge and rest mass can be justied by the quantization of
both values of electric charge and rest mass. we have to determine this relation of quantities
between the electric charge and the rest mass from the experimental values.
the lightest known electrically charged particels are electrons and the positrons as their
charged couterparts. we assume that the mass shift between electron and the electron-
neutrino as the neutral partner results exclusively from the electric charge, from which
results a connection between electric charge and rest mass. therefore, we can use their
specic charge as a characterization for the upper boundary value of the aforementioned
strength of coupling.
for a determined energy value weg we have:

and:

0  k[e]  kq = (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)
k[e] = kq = (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

with the elementary charge: qe = e and the rest mass m0 = me.
for the coupling between electric and magnetic elds at the other application, we have the
value of the light velocity as the quantity of the upper boundary value of this strength of
coupling.
for a determined energy value web we have:

and:

0  k[v]  kc = |c|

k[v] = kc = |c|

for:

for:

0  w[e]  web

(74)

(75)

to calculate the values of the eld energies weg and web we have to compare the strength
of the interactions of the primary and secondary elds. we set for the relation of these
interactions:
(electromagnetic and gravitational interaction)

w[g]
w[e]

(electric and magnetic interaction)

me  k[e]

e

=

k[e]
kq

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

for the relation between electric and magnetic elds, we have to dene the magnetic charge
to compare these interactions. the value of this elementary charge qb is dened by the
quantum condition of dirac [15]:

qb = b =

2h

e

(78)

this condition also occurs with the aharonov-bohm eect [16] therefore, there is no evidence
for the existence of magnetic monopoles.
we obtain for the comparison of the interactions:

w[b]
w[e]

=

k[v]
c

2e

which dieres by the factor of 2e. the sommerfeld constant e is dened by:

so we nd for the maximum couplings:

k[e] = kq = w[g] = w[e]
k[v] = c = w[b] = w[e]

for a description by dimensionless coupling constants similar to the sommerfeld constant
we can dene :

[k[e]] = e 

[k[v]] = e 

k[e]
kq  e
k[v]
c  e

(83)

(84)

therefore these coupling coecients have the property of a running coupling constant. all
these secondary interactions were generated from electromagnetic elds, which are the pri-
mary elds in all these applications and cannot become stronger than the electromagnetic
interactions.
to calculate the quantities of equal interaction strength we determine the ratio of strength of
those interactions, which have no dependency from any coupling coecients. so we have to
calculate the ratio of strength between electromagnetic and gravitational interactions (elec-
trodynamics and general relativity) at the specic case for electromagnetic dipole elds and
gravitational quadrupole elds.
these ratios of strength can be described by the the exchange ratios of spin-1 particles and
spin-2 particles, which can be calculated by the strength of the electromagnetic dipole radi-
ation and the gravitational quadrupole radiation.
to calculate the ratio of radiations we consider the electron-positron system, which has a
non-vanishing dipole moment. (for the strength of the electromagnetic dipole radiation and
the strength of the gravitational quadrupole radiation see for example: p. 208 eq.(67.8) /
216 eq.(70.1) and p. 423 eq.(110.16) / 424 of [17].)
to acquire only the restmass as the source of radiation, we have to calculate nonrelativisti-
cally. in the electron-positron system we can determine r22 by the following connection:

r22 =

then we receive for the ratio of the radiations:

w[m ]

( =g, newton constant).
for an equal exchange ratio of spin-1 particles (dipole radiation) and spin-2 particles
(quadrupole radiation) we set pd = pq.
therefore, we can deduce:

w[e] =

32
e
5  w[m ]

and with w[b]  2e = w[e]:

w[b] =

3e
10  w[m ]

the threshold values are determined by the planck scale of quantum gravity.
the planck energy is dened as:

wp = s hc5



15

(85)

(86)

(87)

(88)

(89)

to get the energy values we set:

wp = w[m ]
w[eg] = w[e]
w[eb] = w[b]

from this result the threshold values of eld energies:

w[eg] = s hc5
 
w[eb] = s hc5

these values of eld energies have the numerical size of:

wp = 1.95  109j

with: e = 1/137.035
we note that: w[eb] > w[eg] because of the factor 2e. for large distances and classical
elds the threshold values of energy (weg and web) for the maximum coupling strength are
dierent from each other and also dierent from the the value of the planck energy wp .
we remember the connection between the scalar coupling coecients and the threshold
values of eld energies:

k[e] = kq  exp

k[v] = kc  exp

these threshold values of the energies weg and web are also dependent on the sommerfeld
constant.
at small distances this constant e becomes an eective running coupling constant e (q2),
which dependency from the energy (transfer of the particle-momentum) is described by
renormalization eects (see for example p. 594 (eq. 12-127) of [18]):

(where  stands for the xing point of renormalization, q for the particle-momentum trans-
fer and be(< 0) corresponds to the number of the charged fermions.)
those eective coupling constants occur in the electroweak and strong interactions, which
should be unied at higher energies [19].

16

the following equation denes an analogous constant for the gravitational interaction de-
pending on the energy in a direct way (not by renormalization):

g =

thus, we receive at the planck energy:

g  1

for:

(101)

(102)

at the planck scale we should expcect that all interactions of particles have the same
strength. this justies the following conditions:

( weg
web )  wp

for:

e(cid:16)q2(cid:17)  1

(103)

the case of small distances results that the values weg and web lie near the planck energy
wp .
the quantization of the gravitational elds (spin-1 graviton) can be realized in an analogous
way as it is possible for the electromagnetic elds in the qed [12, 20]. for spin-2 gravitons
the approach of canonical quantization is only possible for linear equations [21]. however,
as we have already noted, this approach is excluded for spin-2 paricles [8].
all elds in our discussed approach are part of an abelian gauge theory of massless spin-1
particles.
we receive for the general lagrangian in this quantum eld theory (analogous to quantum

electrodynamics) with: q = (cid:16)qe + m  k[e] + qb  0  k[v](cid:17)

at the scale of the planck energy wp , the theory of quantum gravitation must be extended
to include a quantization of spin-2 particles, which lies outside from our approach for the
present.

7 the violation of the discrete symmetries

the common interactions of the primary and secondary elds yield to several consequences
concerning the discrete symmetries of parity, time reversal and charge conjugation.

table: the conservation and violation of discrete symmetries by the connected interactions
with primary and secondary elds of the discussed applications.

in the bottom row of the table we nd an obvious violation of cpt. this violation is caused
by the violation of the electric charge symmetry. the pt-symmetry is generally conserved,
because no axial vectors, which conserve cp (like in the weak interaction), occur as sources
of the elds.
to determine the maximum coupling strength between the electromagnetic and gravita-
tional elds, we have dened in the previous section a relation of quantity between the
electric charge and the restmass of the lightest charged particles (electrons and positrons)
independent of their sign of charge. therefore, both particles must have the same magnitude
of rest mass (p. 158 of [18]), which is also required by the cpt-theorem [22].
in general, the cpt-symmetry is conserved by every relativistic invariant eld theory, which
contains no coupling of gravitational interactions with other interactions. any coupling of
gravity with other interactions causes violation of the charge symmetry, because gravita-
tional charge (mass or energy) can not change its sign by charge conjugation [23].
therefore, the charge symmetry is violated by the electro-gravitational interaction.
for our considerations of the elds result two facts:
(i) the electric charges, like mass and energy, are sources of elds, which have a spherical
conguration.
(ii) the secondary elds resulting from our coupling approach cannot have such spherical
conguration.
thus, it seems that the charge symmetry and the cpt conservation hold for elds with a
spherical symmetry but not for those without spherical symmetry.

8 conclusions

we investigate the generation of elds from other elds by scalar coupling assuming the
priority of the elds in comparison with their sources. this kind of eld generation is only
possible for elds with a non-spherical conguration. therefore, the spherical symmetry of
all these elds is generally broken.
this procedure allows a generation of gravitational elds, which can be described by lin-
ear eld equations. the strengths of the discussed couplings depend on the energy of the
electric or magnetic elds. the maximum coupling strength is determined by the specic
electric charge of the lightest charged paricles (electrons and positrons). thus, we are able
to describe interacting electric, magnetic, and gravitational spin-1 elds, as well as their
quantization, within a common formalism. for the quantum eld theory approach we nd
that the maximum coupling strength is reached at the planck energy as one should expect
for a quantum eld theory of gravitational elds.
as we have seen, these couplings of two dierent elds have important consequences for the
discrete symmetries. the coupling of gravitational elds with other elds causes an obvious
cpt violation.
violations of cpt are also conjectured in string eld theory [24] and in the standard model
[25].

18

however, it seems that for gravitational elds the cpt theorem is not strictly applicable
because general relativity is not a poincare-invariant theory [26]. thus, our investigations
yield to the following conclusions:
it is known that the cpt-symmetry is conserved for the sources, which always generate
spherical elds. however, in our approach the cpt violation occurs through the coupling
between the electromagnetic and gravitational elds. therefore, there must be a dierence
between the sources, which are surrounded by elds with spherical symmetry, and the elds
without spherical symmetry, resulting from our approach.
