abstract

the scalars of an n = 1 supersymmetric -model in 4 dimensions parameterize a kahler mani-
fold. the transformations of their fermionic superpartners under the isometries are often anoma-
lous. these anomalies can be canceled by introducing additional chiral multiplets with appro-
priate charges. to obtain the right charges a non-trivial singlet compensating multiplet can be
used. however when the topology of the underlying kahler manifold is non-trivial, the consis-
tency of this multiplet requires that its charge is quantized. this singlet can be interpreted as a
section of a line bundle. we determine the kahler potentials corresponding to the minimal non-
trivial singlet chiral superelds for any compact kahlerian coset space g/h. the quantization
condition may be in conict with the requirement of anomaly cancelation. to illustrate this,
we discuss the consistency of anomaly free models based on the coset spaces e6/so(10)  u (1)
and su (5)/su (2)  u (1)  su (3).

non-linear -models in 4 dimensions with n = 1 supersymmetry may be the eective
eld theory setting for the discussion of models beyond the standard model. chiral
fermions 
l are contained in an irreducible representation of n = 1 supersymmetry
called chiral multiplets  = (z, 
l, h). the lowest components of those multiplets z
are complex scalars that are the coordinates of a complex kahler manifold m [1]. locally
the metric g of this manifold is obtained from a kahler potential k(z, z). non-trivial
examples of kahler manifolds are provided by homogeneous coset spaces g/h, where g
is any compact lie group and h is the centralizer of a torus in g.

the chiral fermion content of a supersymmetric model based on the kahler manifold
m is often anomalous [2, 3]. this leads to the conclusion that supersymmetric models
based on g/h cosets are inconsistent unless a complete mirror sector is introduced, which
is phenomenological uninteresting as it easily results in large fermion masses [4, 5]. how-
ever one can avoid this by including additional non-mirror (matter) chiral multiplets to
cancel anomalies. in order that these matter multiplets respect all isometries of m they
can be introduced as tensor products of co(ntra)variant vectors on m [9, 10]. this type of
matter alone is often not sucient to build anomaly free models: the charge assignment
is to restrictive. to overcome this diculty, a singlet chiral multiplet was introduced in
ref. [6], that transforms non-trivially under the isometries of m. this non-trivial singlet
supereld can be used as a compensator to give physical chiral multiplets the charges
required for isometry anomaly cancelation. for this non-trivial singlet multiplet, as well
as for the other matter multiplets, invariant kahler potentials have to be constructed.
from these one obtains a supersymmetric lagrangean, that is invariant under the action
of the isometries of m.

the denitions of matter chiral superelds, as given above, take only the local proper-
ties of the kahler manifold m into account. in order to guarantee that the denitions of
these matter multiplets do not lead to global inconsistencies, additional constraints have
to be imposed. in mathematics a well-dened function on a manifold is called section
of a bundle over this manifold.
[7, 8]. in this language, a globally well-dened matter
multiplet has a scalar component that is a section of a bundle. a co(ntra)variant vector
on m can be interpreted globally as a section of the (co)tangent bundle and is therefore
well-dened. the global denition of the non-trivial singlet compensating multiplet is
more involved: when the topology of the kahler manifold m is non-trivial, there is an
additional quantization condition [7], called the cocycle condition. the corresponding
bundle is called a complex line bundle. this quantization condition is equivalent to the
requirement, that the integral over the kahler form associated with the kahler potential
of the non-trivial singlet is equal to 2z.
in particular there is a minimal charge; all
charges of non-trivial singlets have to be an integer number times the minimal charge.
this condition leads to quantization of newtons constant in supergravity theories [11],

1

when the kahler potential is covariant but not invariant. the condition also restricts or
can even be in conict with the freedom of the charge assignment which was used in refs.
[6, 12] to obtain anomaly free supersymmetric models based on the coset g/h.

the objectives of this letter are the following. we want to determine the minimal non-
trivial singlet multiplets that can be coupled to compact kahlerian coset spaces g/h.
such a singlet multiplet can be used in supersymmetric model building to obtain the
appropriate charge assignment for anomaly cancelation. to this end we have to identify
the minimal line bundles, which can be done by showing that the corresponding kahler
form satises a minimal integral condition. to obtain general results, we introduce some
lie group machinery to describe g/h coset spaces for any compact simple lie group g.
using this we review the construction of kahler potentials for these homogeneous spaces
following refs. [13, 14] with a few minor changes in notation. we obtain a generating
set of kahler potentials k j that satisfy the minimal cocycle condition and which may
be used to construct invariant lagrangeans for non-trivial singlets superelds. the last
step is to determine the charges of these superelds. it is essential to know these charges
as they may be such that anomaly cancelation is not possible. to show that is a non-
trivial requirement, we investigate whether the construction of two anomaly free models
is compatible with the cocyle condition: e6/so(10)  u(1) [6] and a grassmannian
version of the standard model [12]. in the latter model matter is introduced by using that
the transformation rules of covariant vectors factorizes. for completeness, we check the
consistency of these matter representations as well.

we start by discussing the quantization condition of the charge of non-trivial singlet
representation when the topology of m is non-trivial: the cocycle condition for a complex
line bundle. by using the covariance of a kahler potential k

k(z, z) = k(z, z)  c(z)  c(z)

under the isometries of m, the transformation rule

s = ec(z)s

(1)

(2)

of the scalar component s of a non-trivial chiral multiplet is obtained. the invariant
kahler potential

kline(s, s; z, z) = sek(z,z)s.

(3)

can be used for supersymmetric model building purposes [6].

a well-dened complex line bundle over a manifold satises consistency conditions [7]
that insure the global existence of this non-trivial singlet representation. in order that

2

this singlet can be interpreted as a section of a line bundle, the cocycle condition on three
overlapping coordinate patches (1, 2, 3) of m demands that

c(123)  c(12) + c(23) + c(31) = 2iz.

(4)

theorems by de rham [7, 15] tell us that this requirement is equivalent to the condition
that the integral 1
integer. locally the kahler form (k) can be obtained from a kahler potential k as

2 rc (k) = z of any kahler 2-form (k) over any 2-cycle c of m is

(k) = ik,dz  dz.

(5)

in this letter we want to obtain the minimal charges of non-trivial singlet matter couplings
to coset spaces g/h. to do this we need to identify a set of kahler potentials k j and a
set of 2-cycles ci such that

zci

(k j) = 2j
i .

(6)

from now on we are only concerned with kahlerian homogeneous coset spaces g/h where
g a simple compact lie group. it is convenient to use the cartan normalization of the
algebra of g which we now review [16, 17, 18]. according to a theorem by borel [19]
a coset g/h is kahlerian if h is the centralizer c(y ) of a torus in g. this torus is
generated by the set y = { i}. the set y can be extended to the set of generators
t = { i} of a cartan subgroup of g. (hence the index i enumerates the elements of t
and i those elements of t which also belong to y .) an arbitrary linear combination of  i
is denoted by  . let  be the generator associated with root  and let i = i denote
the creation and annihilation operators of the simple root i. hermitean conjugation of
the generators is taken to give 
 = . the algebra of g associated
with the simple roots can be stated as


i =  i

and 

[ i,  j] = 0,

[i, j] = ij  j,

[ i, j] = gij j,

(7)

where gij  2hi ,j i
hi,ii = j( i) is the cartan matrix in this normalization. following
[13, 20, 21] we divided the generators of g into the following sets. we have already
dened the set y = { i}. we denote by

s = {sa} = { i|i 6= i}  {| = xi6=i

i

i a root}

(8)

3

the set of generators of h that are not in y . the two sets

x = {x} = {| / s,  > 0} and

x = { x} = {| / s,  < 0}

(9)

contain the remaining part of the generators of g.

using this notation we give representations of elements of h, g/h, etc. an element
h  h is written as h = eiseiy , where a, i  r and summation over indices has been
assumed to be understood. the subset h  gc of the complexication of the group g
is generated by y, s and x. any element h  h of h is represented as h = eax ebsecy ,
where a, ba, ci  c and therefore an element of gc/ h can be written as

(z) = ez x,

(10)

where z  c carries the same root-indices as x. and nally let u(z, z) denote an
element of the unitary representation of g/h. according to [13] h is chosen such that
g/h = gc/ h, hence u(z, z) can be expressed in terms of (z) as

u(z, z) = (z)ea(z,z)xeb(z,z)se 1

2 k(z,z)y .

(11)

the representative u(z, z) of the equivalence classes of g/h is chosen such that b(z, z)
an k(z, z) are real functions. (the normalization of the function k(z, z) is chosen for
convenience later on.)

the non-linear transformation properties of the coordinates z and z of g/h can be

dened using  [21, 20] or u [22, 23] by

g(z) = (z)h(z; g)

and gu(z, z) = u(z, z)h(z, z; g)

(12)

for any element g of g. the functions h and h are chosen such that (z) and u(z, z)
are again of the forms given above. combining these transformation rules with the iden-
tication of g/h with gc/ h according to eq. (11) shows that

k j (z, z) = k j (z, z)  cj (z; g)  cj 

(z; g);

(13)

thus the functions k j (z, z) transform as kahler potentials [13]. there it is shown also
that the set of kahler potentials {k j } is complete.

first of all we want to obtain an explicit formula for a fundamental kahler potential
k j . to this end we consider a representation with orthonormal weight vectors |bj , wi
and highest weight bj , that has all its dynkin labels zero except for the jth one which
is 1: (bj )j = j
j . the highest weight vector |bj , bj i forms a one dimensional irreducible

4

h-representation, as only generator that acts non-trivially on it (j ), is not contained
in y or s. using the bkmu-projector p j  |bj , bj ihbj , bj |, that projects on this
one-dimensional subspace, the fundamental kahler potentials k j can be represented as

k j (z, z) = ln det p j (cid:2)(z)(z)(cid:3) .

(14)

this follows because any kahler potential kb(z, z) obtained using a bkmu-projector b
acting a representation with highest weight b, can be decomposed [13, 14, 21] as

kb(z, z)  ln det b (cid:2)b((z))b((z))(cid:3) = trb(cid:16)b

 i(cid:17)k i(z, z).

(15)

i , using the properties

of the highest weight vector |bj , bj i and the cartan matrix.

for the bkmu-projection operators p j we nd that tr(cid:0)p j  i(cid:1) = j
next we show that the kahler forms of the kahler potentials k j satisfy the minimal
cocycle condition (6). for the generating 2-cycles ci : cp 1  gc/ h we take the con-
tinuous mappings v 7 (0, . . . , 0, zi = v, 0, . . . , 0). using the properties of the projector
p j and the generators i we obtain that kj |ci (v, v) = j
i ln (1 + vv) . this implies that
(k j|ci ) reduces to the standard integral of the cp 1-kahler form over
the integral rci
cp 1 itself. as the latter is equal to 2, we see that the minimal cocycle condition (6) is
satised.

finally we determine the charges of the sections of the minimal line bundles, as these
are the charges of the non-trivial matter multiplets. under innitesimal internal symmetry
transformations, it transforms as sj = cj sj according to eqs. (2) and (13). then to
determine the charge of sj we have to know the holomorphic functions cj for u(1) trans-
formations. using the transformation properties of (z) of eq. (12) where g = exp(ii  i)
with i innitesimal parameters under u(1) transformations generated by  i, we obtain

ii

 i(z) = (z)i h

 iz + ia x + ib s + ic yi .


on the other hand we have that  i(z) = (z)[ i  ( i)
 z], which follows from
[ i, ] = ( i). combining these expressions and using the independence of y ,
s and x gives:
i , iz = i( i)z and ia = ib = 0. this shows that the
minimal  j -charge of a section sj of a line bundle over g/h is half the charge of zj .

icj = ij

we now turn to the consequences of our results for supersymmetric model building. in the
construction of a model we may need the transformation rule of a non-trivial compensating
singlet to get a u(1) charge assignment such that anomaly cancelation is ensured. however
in general it is not guaranteed that the charge we need is an integer multiple of the smallest

5

charge of a non-trivial singlet. how this restriction acts, is now illustrated by two anomaly
free models build upon coset spaces.

ref. [6] discusses an anomaly free model based on the coset e6/so(10)  u(1) [25].
the coset is parameterized by a 16-component spinor of so(10). to cancel the u(1)-
anomaly the model is extended to complete the 27 of e6. according to the branching
rule

27 = 1(4) + 16(1) + 10(2),

(16)

this can be done by introducing a so(10) singlet with charge 4 and a vector of so(10)
with charge 2. as discussed in ref. [6] the vector 10 can be obtained from a tensor
product of 2 covariant vectors of e6/so(10)  u(1). however this vector 10 of so(10)
has charge 2 and the so(10) singlet has charge 0. according to the results above the
minimal charge of a non-trivial compensating singlet is 1/2. hence we need the 8th power
of s to dene the singlet and a rescaling with the 8th power of s of the vector to dene the
vector matter representation with the right charges. both these powers of s are integers,
therefore this models satises the line bundle consistency conditions.

ref. [12] discusses another example of an anomaly free model that is based on the
grassmannian coset su(5)/su(2)  u(1)  su(3) [26, 27, 28] with the chiral fermion
content of the standard model. for this model the question whether it is globally well-
dened is more involved, as matter is not introduced as tangent vectors. to see what the
diculty is, we give a short review of the introduction of matter in this model; for details
we refer to ref. [12].

l . the superpartners l and d of a lepton doublet li

the coordinates qia of this coset are interpreted as the superpartners of the left-handed
quark doublet qia
l and a (down) quark
l were introduced by noticing that the transformation rule for dqia factorizes
triplet da
under innitesimal transformations [12] dq = h(q)dq + dq h(q) where h(q) and
h(q) are holomorphic functions. this can be used to dene innitesimal transformation
rules for l and d: l = h(q)l and d = d h(q). as these are only innitesimal
transformations, we do not obtain any information concerning global consistency.

we now show that l and d can be interpreted as sections of bundles over this coset.

using the transformation property (12) of (q) with a su(5) matrix given by

g = (cid:18)a b

c d(cid:19) ,

(17)

where a  su(2), d  su(3), b a 2  3 and c a 3  2 matrix, we obtain the global
transformation rule for q:

q = (aq + b) (d + cq)1 .

(18)

6

by introducing the matrices  = a1b and  = d1c this can be written as

a1qd = 11  (11  ) (11 + q)1 .

from this equation it follows that the transformation of the dierential factorizes as

q ia
qjb = (g)i

j( g) a
b ,

(19)

indeed dq = a (11  ) (11 + q)1 dq (11 + q)1 d1. now we know that the tangent
bundle is well-dened, therefore the transition functions g(ab) and g(ba) satisfy all con-
sistency conditions by eq. (19). by dening the transition functions acting on l and d
via

l(a) = g(ab)l(b) and d(a) = d(b) g(ba),

(20)

well-dened bundles over su(5)/su(2)  u(1)  su(3) are obtained.

we now turn to the line bundle constraint. in the normalization of the su(5) algebra
employed in ref. [12], the uy (1) charges of q, l and d are resp. 5, 3 and 2. according
to the results above the charges of section of the line bundle are half of the charge of the
coset coordinates q, therefore the minimum charge is 5/2. the matching between the
weak hypercharge yw and the charge y for the quark doublets requires that y = 15yw.
as the hypercharges of the standard model are integer multiples of 1/3, it follows that the
y -charges we need are integer multiples of 5. but any integer multiple of 5/2 plus either
2 or 3 never is an integer multiple of 5, therefore we can never get the standard model
hypercharge assignment. we conclude that the grassmannian standard model with non-
linear compact su(5) symmetry can never be dened globally. to be sure, there exist
consistent grassmannian coset models based on su(5), but with matter content dierent
from the standard model.

the main objective of this work was to determine the kahler potential that satisfy the
minimal quantization condition (6) for a general kahlerian compact coset space g/h.
the bkmu-projector p j projects on the highest weight vector of a representation with
highest weight bj with the dynkin labels (bj )j = j
j . this projector was used to dene
the kahler potential k j (eq. (14)) and its properties showed that this kahler potential
satises the minimal cocycle conditions. the minimal charge of a section sj of a line
bundle associated with  j was found to be half of the charge of zj .
in this way we
obtained an constructive proof a theorem by borel-weil discussed by serre [24] that
classies the elements of the (co)homology groups of g/h.

7

the importance of these results for supersymmetric model building lies in the fact
that they provide an additional restrictions on the charge assignment of supersymmetric
matter coupling and may be in conict with the requirement of anomaly cancelation. this
has been illustrated by the review of two anomaly free models containing a coset space at
their core. the e6/so(10)  u(1) model satises the consistency condition. the analysis
for su(5)/su(2)  u(1)  su(3) was more involved. first we showed that the scalars li
and da are sections of well-dened bundles: using the fact that the transition function
of the tangent bundle factorizes, transition functions for these bundles were obtained.
however the necessary charge assignment of this grassmannian standard model is such
that we can never satisfy the line bundle consistency condition at the same time.

as is clear from these examples the consistent denition of a line bundle provides
a stringent restriction on supersymmetric -models, in particular those based on coset
spaces. with this in mind, it is interesting to study what kind of other supersymmetric
models are allowed and what their phenomenology is.
