abstract

we work out the physical eld variables and write down the physical hamil-
tonian for the chern-simons-maxwell theory by working with the symplectic
projector method.

1 introduction

some years ago, we developed a method based on the so-called symplectic projectors to
work in the framework of gauge eld theories [1, 2]; the idea of the procedure is to pick out
from the original set of eld variables those which are the true or physical variables.
this would be the rst step to treat a gauge theory in a strictly canonical way [3, 4, 5].
we show in this letter how to derive the physical hamiltonian for the d = 3-chern-
simons-maxwell (csm) model with the coulomb gauge conditions without coupling to
matter elds. its expression is closely related to the one previously found in a work by
devecchi et al [6], where the dirac bracket quantization procedure (dbqp) has been
adopted. here, we proceed along a dierent way and try to check the ecacy of the
symplectic projector method by applying it to a 3 - dimensional gauge theory.

2 the physical hamiltonian for the csm theory

we start o from the lagrangian density

l =

f  f   + m   a  a,

where the metric (1, 1, 1) is adopted.

the generalised hamiltonian has the following canonical form:

h = z d 2 x (cid:20)1

 i  i +

1

2 (cid:0)i j  i a j(cid:1)2

+

m2 a k a k + m i j a i  j(cid:21) ,

with the (second class) constraint relations:

1 =  0 = 0,

2 =  i  i + m  i j  j a i = 0,

3 = a0 = 0,

4 =  i a i = 0.

to set up a symplectic structure, we rename eld variables according to the following

correspondence:

(cid:0)a0, a1, a2, 0, 1, 2(cid:1)  (cid:0)1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6(cid:1) .

(7)

the constraints  i dene a local metric,

gi j, which is the inverse of gi j (x, y) =

{ i (x) ,  j (y) } , and reads formally as below:

g1 =

0

  2 (x  y)

the general form for the symplectic projectors is given by the expression that follows

[1] :

 

 (x, y) =  

  2 (x  y)     z d 2 r d 2  gi j (r, )   ( x)  i (r)  ( y)  j () ,

(9)

with   ( x)  i (r)    i (r)
   (x) .

after a lengthy but straightforward calculation, we nd:

getting the physical variables,  

 (x), is a simple matter of applying the prescription

   (x) = z d 2 y  

 (x, y)  (y) ;

we get thereby:

 1 (x) =  4 (x) = 0,

 2 (x) = a 

1 (x) ,

(11)

(12)

(13)

 3 (x) = a 

2 (x) ,

 5 (x) =  

1 (x)  m a 

2 (x) ,

 6 (x) =  

2 (x) + m a 

1 (x) .

(14)

(15)

(16)

now, our original constrained hamiltonian written in symplectic coordinates takes

over the form:

h = z d 2 x (cid:20) 1

5 +  2

2 (cid:0) 2

6(cid:1) +

1

(1 3  2 2) 2 +

1
2

2 +  2

m2 (cid:0) 2

3(cid:1) + m ( 2  6   3  5)(cid:21) ;

(17)

on the other hand, the projected hamiltonian becomes as below:

h = z d2x(cid:20)1

5 +  2

2 (cid:0) 2

6 (cid:1) +

m2(cid:0) 2

2 
3 (cid:1) + m ( 

6   

5)(cid:21) .

(18)

coming back to the original phase-space notation, with the help of eqs. (12)  (15),

we nally conclude that the projected hamiltonian reads as below:

h = z d2 x (cid:20)1

2 (cid:0)

i 

i + 4 m2a 

i a 

i (cid:1) +

1

j (cid:1)2
2 (cid:0)  i j  i a 

+ 2 m (cid:0)a

1  

2  a 

2 

1 (cid:1)(cid:21) .

(19)

this is the chern-simons-maxwell hamiltonian written in terms of the so-called trans-
verse expression, which agrees with the results found in ref.[6] along a dierent line of
arguments.

we wish to stress a very important point of these results: the physical hamiltonian is
the one given by eq.(18)
in that the physical variables, those obeying canonical poisson
brackets, are the  s and not the familiar transverse eld variables. the only reason to
write down h according to eq.(19) is to establish a bridge between our approach and
the usual terminology.

going over to the equations of motion and using the physical hamiltonian within the

framework of the hamilton-jacobi equations, we nd that:

 
2 =  2 m2  

2 + 2 2  

2  1 2  

3  2 m  
6,

(20)

 
3 =  2 m2  

3 + 1 1  

3  1 2  

2  2 m  
5,

 
5 =  2 m2  

5 + 2 2  

5  1 2  

6 + m (cid:2) 2 m2  2(cid:3)  

3,

 
6 =  2 m2  

6 + 1 1  

6  1 2  

5  m (cid:2)2m2  2(cid:3)  

2.

(21)

(22)

(23)

apparently, these equations might look rather strange; but, if we go back to the most
familiar notation, by means of the correspondence between the as, s and s (eq.(7)),
we can cast them under the form:

(cid:0)(cid:3) + 4 m 2(cid:1) a 

1 =  2 m  
2 ,

(cid:0)(cid:3) + 4 m 2(cid:1) a 

2 = 2 m  
1 ,

(cid:3)  

1 = 0,

(cid:3)  

2 = 0,

which amount to ensuring that

(cid:3) (cid:0)(cid:3) + 4 m2(cid:1) a 

i = 0,

(i = 1, 2) .

(24)

(25)

(26)

(27)

(28)

this guarantees that the physical excitation is a massive (p2 = 4 m 2) transverse vector;
the massless pole is a spurious one: it has no dynamical role and does not correspond to
any physical mode . indeed, in coupling the a - eld propagator to a conserved external
current, the current-current amplitude is such that the imaginary part of its residue taken
at the pole p2 = 0 vanishes, which conrms that the latter does not correspond to any
physical excitation.
