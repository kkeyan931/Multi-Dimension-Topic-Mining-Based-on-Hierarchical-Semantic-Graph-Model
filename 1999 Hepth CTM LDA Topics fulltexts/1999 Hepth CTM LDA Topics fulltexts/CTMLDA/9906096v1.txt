abstract

classication of n = 4 superconformal symmetries in two dimensions is
re-examined. it is proposed that apart from su(2) and su(2)su(2)u(1)
their kac-moody symmetry can also be su(2)  (u(1))4. these supercon-
formal symmetries and corresponding algebras are named small, large and
middle ones respectively. operator product expansions for the middle algebra
are derived. complete free eld realizations of large and middle supercon-
formal symmetries are obtained.

conformal symmetries in two space-time dimensions have been very ex-
tensively studied owing to their applications both in string theory and two
dimensional statistical systems. the same is true for their supersymmetric
generalisations which have been classied at least upto n = 3 superconfor-
mal symmetries in the sense that we know the corresponding superconformal
graded lie algebras, operator product expansions (opes) and the free eld
realizations. same, however, can not be said for theories with n = 4 super-
conformal symmetries. this situation is remedied in this note. this should
also complete the classication of all two dimensional linear superconformal
theories because n = 4 symmetries are the highest ones which can have non-
vanishing central charges without requiring operators of negative dimensions.
classication of n = 4 superconformal symmetries is very interesting
because, unlike the n = 1, 2 and 3 cases, there exist three such symme-
tries. easiest way to distinguish among them is to specify their kac-moody
symmetries. an n = 4 superconformal symmetry can have either su(2) or
su(2)su(2)u(1) or su(2)(u(1))4 kac-moody subsymmetry. we shall
refer to corresponding superconformal symmetries (algebras) as small, large
and middle ones respectively. out of these symmetries the small and large
ones are well known and well established. our aim in this note is to obtain
minimal information required to put the middle symmtery on equal footings
with them. redressal of this problem acquires certain urgency because of
abundant occurrence of n = 4 superconformal symmetries in the context of
ads-cft correspondence [1]-[5] related to three dimensional stringy black
hole [4, 6] backgrounds as well as d1/d5 system [7, 8].

this paper is organised as follows. first of all we very briey describe
the small n = 4 superconformal symmetry algebra and present correspond-
ing (anti-) commutation relations, opes and a suitable free eld realization.
next we do the same for the large algebra. after that we list the (anti-) com-
mutation relations of the middle algebra and derive corresponding opes. a
free eld realization of this symmetry is then obtained. this realization
turns out to be incomplete. we identify the source of this problem and
then take appropriate steps to remove the discrepancy. to do it we start by
generalizing the most commonly used free eld realization of the large alge-
bra. a complete free eld realization of the middle algebra is then obtained.
finally conclusions about complete classication of n = 4 superconformal
symmetries in two dimensions and suggestions for further investigations are
presented.

the small n = 4 superconformal symmetry was discovered by ade-
mollo et al [9]. it is generated by eight operators consisting of the energy-
momentum tensor t (z), its four superpartners ga(z), a  {0, i}, i  {1, 2, 3}
and three su(2) kac-moody currents j i(z). corresponding holomorphic
anomalous dimensions are 2, 3/2 and 1 respectively. modes of these oper-
ators are denoted by lm, ga
m respectively. these modes satisfy the
following small n = 4 graded lie superconformal algebra.

we now summarize the large n = 4 superconformal algebra, its opes
and its most commonly used free eld realization. the corresponding sym-
metry is generated by sixteen operators. apart from the energy-momentum
tensor t (z) and its four superpartners ga(z) it has seven weight 1 currents
{ai(z), u(z)} generating su(2)su(2)u(1) kac-moody subalgebra and
four weight 1/2 fermionic currents qa(z). we shall denote the correspond-

this superalgebra has two independent parameters unlike all the other

with cyclic expressions for g2(z) and g3(z). central charge for this real-
ization is c = 6(k + 1)/(k + 2) while other parameters have values k = 1,
k+ = k + 1,  = 1/(k + 2). above realizations is the most commonly used
one in the literature. this algebra too has been studied very extensively but
we shall not go into those aspects. rather we now turn to the middle n = 4
superalgebra.

6

the middle n = 4 superconformal algebra was discovered in [14]. this
algebra too has sixteen generators but the kac-moody subalgebra this time
is su(2) (u(1))4 generated by the weight 1 currents j i(z) and u a(z) where
u a(z)  { u(z) = u 0(z), u i(z)}. here all u a(z)s are u(1) currents. other
generators of this symmetry are denoted in this note by t (z), ga(z) and
qa(z) with conformal weights 2, 3/2 and 1/2 repectively. modes of these
operators are j i
r respectively. these modes satisfy the
following middle n = 4 superconformal graded lie algebra.

in reference [14] this algebra was obtained from the large algebra through
a specic inonu-wigner contraction. since this contraction procedure will
be required again in the rest of this note, we begin by reviewing it. first of
all we make the following redenitions

1q1  um.

um = lim

some of these seem to have vanishing right hand sides and others seem to be
trivial. neither of these observations is true because above redenitions are

7

used to obtain the (anti-) commutators (10) from (7). this is done as follows.
we make above redenitions in the (anti-) commutators of the large algebra
without taking the singular limit   1 such that only hatted generators
are used. after that we take the limit   1. this limit makes some of the
terms vanish. in particular the currents u i
m are abelianized. thus one of the
su(2) kac-moody subalgebras of the large algebra is changed to (u(1))3.
as a consequence the middle algebra gets an su(2)  (u(1))4 kac-moody
m as k for the
subalgebra. we rename the level k+ of the su(2) currents a+i
currents j i
m. another eect of above singular rescalings is to reduce the
central charge to the value c = 6k.

it is worth noticing that due to inner z2 grading of the large algebra an

equivalent inonu-wigner contraction would have been the following one.

u i

lm = lim

qa

m = lim

r = lim

um = lim

qa

um.

(12)

this way we would have got a middle algebra equivalent to (10) with central
charge c = 6k = 6k with roles of +i
ab interchanged. here k = k is
the level of the su(2) algebra generated by the currents j i
m. depending on
our convenience we shall use both of these contractions.

ab and i

we have chosen the name middle for this new symmetry since it has
features common to both of the other symmetries. like the small symmetry
it has only one su(2) subalgebra and does not have n = 3 as a subsymmetry
and possibly can not be topologically twisted. at the same time like the large
algebra it has sixteen generators out of which seven are of kac-moody nature.
unlike the small algebra it is not a subalgebra of the large algebra. like the
large algebra the middle one also has the small algebra as a subalgebra. more
precisely the small algebra is an invariant subalgebra of the middle algebra.
moreover the kac-moody subalgebra su(2) (u(1))4 is more stringent than
su(2) but less than su(2)  su(2)  u(1).
in reference [14] the opes of the middle algebra were not derived. we
shall do so now. we make following substitutions in eqs.(8)

t (z) = lim
1

t (z),

u i(z) = lim

1q1  ai(z),

8

ga(z) = lim
1
j i(z) = lim
1

ga(z),

a+i(z),

qa(z) = lim

u(z) = lim

1q1  qa(z),
1q1  u(z)

(13)

together with the redenitions c = lim1 c and k = lim1 k+. just like
earlier cases we take the limit   1 after making above redenitions in the
opes. as a result of this inonu-wigner contraction many crucial changes
occur in equations containing the operators u a and qa. for example u i
terms disappear from ga gb ope. other terms which disappear are qb in
j i ga, gb term in u i ga, u k term in u i u j, j i term in qa gb and qb term in
u i qa. most of the central terms too are modied. these steps lead us to
the following opes for the middle algebra.

(14)

it is a straightforward exercise to verify that these opes lead to the
middle superalgebra given in eqs.(10). once again we should remember that
by rescaling a+i(z), qa(z) and u(z) instead of ai(z), qa(z) and u(z) we
would have got the opes of the equivalent middle superconformal algebra.

9

if the middle algebra is part of the family of n = 4 superalgebras then,
like the other two cases, symmetry corresponding to it too should have proper
free eld realizations.
it turns out that there is an obstacle in achieving
this goal. to see it we start by inonu-wigner contraction of the free eld
realization (9) of the large algebra because that is the easiest route for us
owing to the origin of the middle algebra. this time we shall use the other
rescalings given by eqs.(12) reason for which will become apparent at the end
of this process. since for the realization (9) we have  = 1/(k + 1) we shall
do the following rescalings

t (z) = lim

k

t (z),

u i(z) = lim

k

ga(z) = lim

j i(z) = lim

,

(15)

for the operators occurring in the realization (9). after making the rede-
nitions without taking the limit we implement the contraction procedure by
making   0 or k  . this results in the following free eld realization
of the middle algebra.

t (z) = j 0j 0  u iu i + aa,
q(z) = a(z),
u (z) = j 0(z),
j 1(z) = 01 + 23, cyclic for j 2,3,
u i(z) = u i(z),
g0 = 2(j 00 + u ii),
g1(z) = 2(j 01  u 10 + u 23  u 32)

(16)

with cyclic expressions for g2 and g3. here u a(z), u i(z) and j 0(z) are all
u(1) currents. particularly u i(z) is the abelianized set obtained by contrac-
tion of j i(z). the central charge of this realization is c = 6k = 6. this is
the problem with this realization which has been alluded to earlier. it has
a xed value of the central charge. for eective use of a conformal symme-
try its realizations with general central charges are desirable. using above
realization the only way to obtain other central charges is to pile on several
copies, say k, of this realization to get c = 6k. this of course is not satisfac-
tory because it involves a large number of free elds while from experience

10

we know that it is not necessary to involve large number of elds to get a
general values of the central charge.

it should be claried that lack of a free eld realization with a general
central charge does not cast any aspersions on the algebraic structure of this
symmetry which conforms to all the norms of a graded lie superconformal
symmetry. problem lies exclusively with the free eld realizations. if this
algebras does not have proper free eld realizations then it will end up just
as a mathematical curiosity with little applications to string theory or 2d
critical phenomena. this fear arises because of its origin in inonu-wigner
contraction. it is a well known fact that inonu-wigner contraction reduces
the central charge to either zero or a xed value [15]. fortunately this will not
be so for the case of the middle algebra. we shall prove it below by explicit
construction but we can see formally also that this algebra will have proper
realizations. in usual contraction procedures the central charge is used up
for singular rescalings and is thus reduced to a particular value, singular or
otherwise. in such cases there is no other choice of rescalings since central
charge is the only free parameter in the algebra. in the particular case under
consideration we are lucky because the large algebra has two free parameters,
c and  or k+ and k, as pointed out earlier. in our rescalings we use only
one of them, say , and therefore the central charge is still left as a free
parameter. this indicates that general free eld realizations of this algebra
should exist.

to nd proper realizations of the middle algebra we have to identify
the source of the problem in the existing realizations. to do so we again
start with the free eld realization of the large algebra. let us consider
the su(2) currents in (9). we notice that the currents a+i are realized
in terms of another set j i of su(2) currents supplemented by fermionic
su(2) construction. on the other hand currents ai rely solely on fermionic
su(2) construction and do not have any genuine su(2) currents in them.
in free eld realization (16) of the middle algebra the currents j i have been
abelianized leaving us with no genuine su(2) currents a fact also conrmed
by the expressions of the currents j i. this is what leads us to a xed central
charge since general values 6k or 6k come from the level k or k of su(2) kac-
moody algebra. moreover we can see that the second equivalent contraction
procedure for the realization (9) does not help either because in this case
one has to take   1 which demands k = 0 giving c = 6(0 + 1) = 6 again.
thus we can solve the problem only if we can introduce a genuine su(2) set

11

of currents in the realization of the middle n = 4 symmetry. this in turn
requires that we do the contraction of such a realization of the large algebra
which has two genuine sets of free su(2)s.

in view of these circumstances we rst take the problem of nding a more
general free eld realization of the large algebra itself. above identication of
the source of problem and a look at the realization (9) immediately gives us
an idea to proceed further. we are tempted to introduce two sets j i(z) of
su(2) currents with levels qi in the realization (9) such that ais are dened
as j is supplemented by fermionic terms together with suitable changes at
other places in the realization. that this naive attempt is inadequate can be
seen as follows. total central charge contributed by the free elds in this case
is 3q+/(q+ + 2) + 3q/(q + 2) + 3. here rst two terms are the contributions
of j i. four fermions a and the free boson (z) that gives the u(1) current
u(z)  j 0(z) = (z) contribute the last term 3 = 4(1/2) + 1. this central
charge is, in general, not the same as the required value which at this point
is 6(q+ + 1)(q + 1)/(q+ + q + 2) because now the currents ai have levels
q + 1.

to overcome this new diculty we shall not use generalised sugawara
construction since we want a simple free eld realization. on the other hand
we can not put a background charge on (z) since it will spoil the u(1)
nature of j 0(z). what really has happened is that introduction of three
extra su(2) currents has tilted the balance of free elds in favour of bosonic
ones. again, in a realization, it is by no means necessary that numbers of
fermionic and bosonic elds be equal but this is a good paradigm to stick
to-particularly so for linear realizations of supersymmetry. once again we
take up the expressions for ai(z) and introduce more fermions, say a(z), in
them parallel to the existing ones. this step too leads us to similar problems.
firstly, we have one fermionic free eld more than the number of bosonic
elds. secondly, required and available central charges still do not match.
free elds this time contribute a total of 3q+/(q+ + 2) + 3q/(q + 2) + 5
while algebraic consistency demands the value 6(q+ + 2)(q + 2)/(q+ + q +
4); currents ai now having levels q + 2. the rst problem is solved by
introducting an extra free boson (z) in the realization which increases the
contribution of free elds to the central charge to 3q+/(q+ + 2) + 3q/(q +

but this decient central charge can now be compensated by putting suitable
background coulomb charges on free bosons. earlier restriction on back-
ground charge is no more a problem. since there are two bosons now they
will always have a linear u(1) combination. we shall get above decient cen-
tral charge if we put background charges a0 and b0 on  and  repectively
such that a2 + b2 = 1. since  decides relative weightage of inner z2 grading

in this algebra the easiest guess for a and b are a =  and b = 1  .

reason for an extra negative sign in b will become clear shortly.

if we had chosen b above with a positive sign then sign of k 0 in (19) would
have also changed. expressions for the two su(2) currents also are very sim-
ple to write. these are generalizations of the expressions in (9) to incorporate
a and j i. thus we get

a+1(z) = j +1  01 + 23  01 + 23, cyclic for a+2,3,
a1(z) = j 1 + 01 + 23 + 01 + 23, cyclic for a2,3.

(20)

expressions for ga(z)s too are easy to write but they are tedious to verify.
they will have {j 0, j +i, a} terms as in the realization (9) and similar terms
in {k 0, j i, a}. since opes ga(z)ga() (no sum on a) give the energy-
momentum tensor which now has background terms, we must make provision
for generating such terms. we do so by adding partial derivatives of a and
a to the expressions of the supercurrents ga. coecients of these partial
derivatives are xed by the requirements that correct background charge
terms of t (z) are generated in above mentioned opes. the coecients of
j +i and j ia type terms in ga(z) are xed by the requirement that gagb,
where a 6= b, opes give correct coecients of the su(2) currents on the right
hand side. explicit calculations give the following forms for the supercurrents

with cyclic expressions for g2 and g3. finally the expressions for qa(z)s are
obtained by calculating the opes u(z)ga() and comparing them with the
required form. this way we get the following expressions

qa(z) = s c

(22)

we have now all the operators of the large n = 4 superconformal sym-
metry in terms of sixteen free elds j i, , , a and a. expressions
(18)-(22) give a realization of the large n = 4 superconformal symmetry
which is complete in all aspects relevant for us. it has two genuine su(2)
currents j i with levels q which lead to proper realizations of ai with lev-
els k+ = q+ + 2 = c/(6) and k = q + 2 = c/(6(1  )). in it the number

14

of free eld is equal to the number of generators of the symmetry. finally we
would like to remark that these expressions should be closely related to the
generators of the n = 4 supersymmetry of a non-linear sigma model studied
in [13] that have remained largely unnoticed.

above realization can immediately be used to obtain new free eld re-
alizations of the small n = 4 and n = 3 superconformal symmetries since
both of them are subsymmetries of the large one. one also notices that in
this realization the coulomb charge terms vanish precisely for c = 6. this
observation explains the special nature of realizations with c = 6 for n = 4
superconformal algebras and their common occurrence. in above realization
one can ignore the su(2) currents and the algebra is realized with the help
of ten free elds including eight fermions and two bosons.

at this point we have all the ingredients required to obtain a complete
free eld realization of the middle algebra. as expected realization (18)-
(22) can be contracted in two ways to give two equivalent realizations of the
middle n = 4 superconformal symmetry. by doing singular rescalings of
the operators ai, j i, qa, and u we get the following expressions for the
operators of the middle n = 4 superconformal symmetry.

with cyclic expressions for g2(z) and g3(z). here the operators v i(z),
u (z)and u i(z) are all u(1) currents; v i(z)s being the abelianized version
of j i(z)s. this realization of the middle n = 4 superconformal symme-
try, having a central charge c = 6k = 6(q+ + 2), is complete in all aspects
discussed above. leaving out the generators u(z), u i(z) and qa(z) from
eqs.(23) we get another realization for the small symmetry.

in view of the above results we conclude that the middle algebra has
(anti-) commutators, opes and a free eld realization on par with the other
superconformal symmetries and should be treated as such. the complete
classication of n = 4 superconformal algebras therefore has three members-
large, middle and small. this classication is complete in the sense that we
can not further contract the middle algebra or the small algebra to obtain
more n = 4 superalgebras because in doing so we shall lose the remaining
parameter, the central charge. this classication of n = 4 together with
other superconformal algebras is summarized in table a.

16

to conclude we have re-examined the classication of n = 4 supercon-
formal symmetries. we have proposed to enhance the number of such sym-
metries from two to three by studying some essential aspects of a new n = 4
symmetry called middle one in this note. since large and small algebras
have been very extensively studied in literature the same can be done for the
middle algebra too because we now have its opes and a complete free eld
realization. moreover the realization (18)-(22) itself should lead to renewed
inestigations of many aspects of the large algebra.

results of this note will have numerous applications. these are broadly
divided into three categories. in the rst category we include the study of the
various aspects of middle and large symmetries themselves while the second
one pertains to uses of above free eld realizations and their decendents. the
third category is related to occurrences of the middle n = 4 symmetry in
string theory.

in the light of above realization (18)-(22) we can generalize the existing
kazama-suzuki type constructions [16, 17] for the large n = 4 superconfor-
mal algebra to incorporate real su(2)s in both sets of the ai(z)s. we expect
that more general constructions rather than simple wolf spaces [18] are rele-
vant for the large algebra. this in turn can be used to obtain kazama-suzuki
realizations of the middle symmetry. one could also ask whether there is a
nonlinear algebra corresponding to the middle algebra [19]. above free eld
realizations should also be derivable by hamiltonian reduction [20]. an-
other open problem is the study of corresponding nonlinear sigma models
[21] which also will be useful to study superstring actions with n = 4 world
sheet supersymmetry combined with manifest target space duality [22] along
the lines of [23] or [24].

above free eld realization of the large symmetry will be quite useful
in the applications of n = 2 topological superconformal eld theories [25].
screening operators and related aspects of the middle algebra on the lines of
ref.[26] can also be investigated.

few years ago it was observed that n strings can be obtained as a special
class of vacua of n + 1 strings [27]. it will be interesting to nd out the place
of the middle n = 4 string in this hierarchy. a route to nd the critical
dimensions of the corresponding string will be to do the brst quantization
of a system with middle algebra as constraints on the lines of ref.[28]. we
also suspect that this symmetry could be relevant for the coulomb and higgs
branches of (4, 4) supersymmetric eld theories in two dimensions[29] as

17

well as for strings moving on solitons [30, 31] which have at least the small
algebra. in the ads-cft correspondence the relevant space time symmetry
for superstring propagating on curved spacetime manifold m = ads3 s3
t 4 should be the middle n = 4 superconformal symmetry itself [4, 7, 32].
we expect to return to some these problems in near future.
