abstract

we give arguments in the support of a relation between m-atrix theory and maldacenas
conjecture. in the limit when light-like circle of m-theory decompacties, m-atrix theory
conjecture implies the equivalence of 11-d light-cone supergravity and strongly-coupled
(0+1)-d sym. large-n version of maldacenas conjecture, sugra/sym duality, can
be formulated as the validity of supergravity description in the substringy region with
some restrictions on the curvature, etc. it implies, in the one dimensional sym case, the
equivalence between strongly-coupled (0+1)-d sym and 11-d supergravity compactied
on a spatial circle in the formal sen-seiberg limit. on the other hand, there is a classical
equivalence between 11-d supergravity on a light-like circle and on a spatial circle in the
formal sen-seiberg limit. we thus see that in the (0+1)-d sym case, the large-n, low
energy version of m-atrix theory is equivalent to sugra/sym duality.

m-atrix theory [1, 2] and maldacenas conjecture [3] are similar in the sense that both
are about the equivalence between m/string theories (i.e. theories in the bulk space-time)
and brane world-volume theories. but does this similarity go beyond a mere analogy?
maldacenas conjecture relates m/string theory on a curved background to sym in the
at space, whereas m-atrix theory relates m-theory on a transverse torus to sym on
a dual torus.1 for example, consider nite-n m-atrix theory on a 3-torus. if v3 is the
volume of m-theory transverse 3-torus and rthe radius of light-like circle, then the
corresponding d=4 sym is dened on a dual 3-torus of volume v3 = (rm 3
. dual
p v3)1 also blows up in this
3-torus decompacties in the limit v3  0 , but g2
limit. in the large-n limit one has to take r  . we thus have g2
ym  1 and n  1,
and this limit is dierent from the one involved in ads5/cf t4 correspondence.

these formal arguments do not, however, imply that the two conjectures are in conict
with each other, but rather suggest the following possibility. imagine two moduli spaces:
m1 of m-theory and m2 of sym ( coordinates of these moduli spaces are: the dimension
d of sym, the rank n of gauge group, the type of gauge theory base space, the type of
space on which m-theory is compactied and so on). one can think of the two conjectures
as two one-to-one maps fmatrix and fmaldacena between certain regions of m1 and m2.
it is clear that if these mappings map two non-overlapping regions in m1 into two non-
overlapping regions in m2, it does not mean that they contradict each other (see figure
1). a natural question to ask is whether the domains of these two mappings intersect,
and if so, are the two mappings identical in the overlap? the motivation for writing this
paper was to answer this question.

in this paper we will be dealing with (0+1)-d sym case. one dimensional sym is
simplest in the sense that no compactication is involved. the purpose of this paper is
to establish a relation between large-n, uncompactied m-atrix theory in the supergrav-
ity limit and sugra/sym duality (large-n version of maldacenas conjecture) in this
one dimensional case. before we explain this relation, let us review m-atrix theory and

still very poorly understood [4].

sugra/sym duality conjectures. we give a somewhat detailed review of these conjec-
tures not because we are pedantic, but rather to point out some important assumptions
relevant to our analysis.

the nite-n version of m-atrix theory conjecture [2], as claried by sen and seiberg
[5, 6], states that discrete light-cone quantization (dlcq) of m-theory (with the planck
scale mp and a transverse length scale x) compactied on a light-like circle (x  x +
r is equivalent to m -
2r) in the sector with the total longitudinal momentum p = n

the large-n version of m-atrix theory conjecture[1] is a related statement about the
uncompactied 11-d light-cone m-theory. it is assumed that the large-n version of m-
atrix theory is the r, n   (with n/r = xed) limit of nite-n theory.

compelling arguments for the validity of nite-n m-atrix theory conjecture were given
by seiberg and sen [6, 5].2 let t be a eld theory (with a mass scale and a set of
dimensionless parameters {yi}) formulated in a at background (or in a background of
the form r1,1  m which has so(1, 1) isometry). let hdlcq
(m, r,{yi}) be the n-
body dlcq quantum mechanical hamiltonian describing the dynamics of the theory t
compactied on a light-like circle (x  x+2r) in the sector with the total longitudinal
momentum p = n
r . the dynamics of the theory t compactied on a small spatial circle
(x  x + 2 r) in the sector with n units of total momentum along the x direction is
also expected to be described by a non-relativistic n-body hamiltonian.3 we denote it
n ( m , r,{yi}). now, thinking of the light-like circle as an almost light-like circle
by hkk
and boosting it, one can show that

the essence of sugra/sym duality is the following: surround a d-brane source in
supergravity by a sphere of radius . supergravity is a low energy limit of string theory
and hence, a priori, it is valid only outside of the sphere. it is claimed that if the curvature
and eective string coupling of the supergravity solution are small, supergravity is valid
also inside of the sphere. it should be noted, however, that this idea does not give a precise
recipe for the sugra/sym correspondence. the rules of the game should be specied
for a particular sugra background, etc. for example, in the ads/cft case, such a
recipe is given in [8, 9]. in this case, the correspondence is between the uctuations of
supergravity elds around the curved ads background and sym operators. in the (0+1)-
d sym case we interpret sugra/sym duality as a relation between the scattering of
supergravity objects in a at background and the corresponding sym processes. for a
discussion of sugra/sym duality in the non-conformal cases, see [10].

we thus see that in the m-atrix theory context (0+1)-d sym in the large-n limit is
equivalent to 11-d light-cone supergravity, and in the context of sugra/sym duality
it is equivalent to 11-d supergravity on a spatial circle in the formal sen-seiberg limit.
assuming that m-atrix theory and sugra/sym duality are related, this suggests that
there should exist a relation between light-cone 11-d supergravity and 11-d supergravity
on a spatial circle in the formal sen-seiberg limit (see figure 2). indeed, it was noticed
in [12, 13] that the scattering potentials calculated in these two supergravities agree. it
is also known that innitely boosting the d0-brane supergravity solution is equivalent to
taking a near-horizon limit (sen-seiberg limit). the authors of [14, 15] used this fact to
argue that sugra/sym duality and m-atrix theory are equivalent. their arguments
can be summarized as follows, motivated by the nite-n version of m-atrix theory, let
us up-lift the d0-brane sugra metric to 11-d and then compactify it on x. as as
result, we nd that the harmonic function h0 is replaced by h0  1. now rewrite this
metric in terms of new symbols (r, gs, etc.) that are related to the original ones (r, gs,

3

etc.) by sen-seibergs relations eq. (1). we dont know the meaning of this procedure,
but lets see what we get. now, let us appropriately rescale (using sen-seibergs relations)
the resulting metric written in terms of new symbols. we nd that this rescaled metric is
precisely that of the d0-brane in the the near-horizon limit! so, we see the validity of sen-
seibergs prescription when applied to the background geometry of supergravity associated
with the dlcq of m-theory. we also see that (0+1)-d sym is equivalent to uctuations4
of sugra elds around the curved near-horizon d0-brane background. since we know
that the latter statement is precisely that of sugra/sym duality, we seem to have shown
that sugra/sym duality follows from m-atrix theory. 

there are several objections against their line of reasoning. first, the meaning of
taking sen-seibergs limit in the expression for the metric is not clear. in sen-seibergs
derivation of m-atrix theory, this limit was taken in the full m-theory and not just in
supergravity. second, the discussion of the authors of [14, 15] seems to imply that two
m-theories formulated in the curved backgrounds are related via seibergs boost, but the
backgrounds they considered do not have so(1,1) isometry.

we resolve the rst problem by clarifying the meaning of taking sen-seibergs limit
in supergravity expressions. its meaning is the classical equivalence of 11-d supergrav-
ities on light-like and spatial circles. the second problem is resolved by interpreting
sugra/(0+1)-d sym duality in a way dierent from what they did. we stated earlier
our interpretation of this duality in one-dimensional case: ... relation between the scat-
tering of supergravity objects in a at background and the corresponding sym processes.

in order to show that m-atrix theory and sugra/sym duality are related one has
to use the rectangle of relations (see figure 2) and the classical equivalence of two
supergravities. let us prove the classical equivalence of two supergravities. let us denote
n ( m , r,{yi}) classical hamiltonians of a theory compactied
by h l.c.
on light-like and spatial circles in the sectors with n units of longitudinal momentum. in
the hamiltonian formulation we associate them with the vector elds (/x+) and (/t).
the analog of eq. (2) in this classical case reads

n (m, r,{yi}) and h s.l.

n (m, r,{yi}) = lim

note that the statements expressed by eq. (2) and eq. (4) are very dierent. the latter
states the equivalence of two classical eld theory hamiltonians and the former states
the equivalence of two quantum mechanical n-body hamiltonians. it is the exploitation
of this dierence that enables us to establish the relation between the two conjectures.
applying eq. (4) to 11-d supergravity formulated in a at background, one establishes
the classical equivalence between the two supergravities.5

4we think these authors implicitly assumed this when they talked about the background geometry

etc.

5it would be interesting to see the extent to which the account of gravitational eects on the light-cone

discussed in [11] changes our conclusion.

let us give some examples [12, 13] which illustrate eq. (4). the potential for graviton-
graviton scattering with no longitudinal momentum transfer in 11-d supergravity com-
pactied on a light-like circle reads [12]

in eq. (5) n(1)/r and n(2)/r are the logitudinal momenta p of the source and probe
gravitons, vtheir relative transverse velocity and r their transverse separation. the cor-
responding expression for the graviton-graviton scattering potential in 11-d supergravity
compactied on a spatial circle reads

which follow from eq. (1), it is easy to show that hl.c. = lim r0 hs.l..

teraction in d = 11 supergravity with compact light-like direction. let p(1)
 = n(1)/r,
p(2)
 = n(2)/r and m(1), m(2) be the longitudinal momenta and masses of the source and
probe membranes, respectively. in the case of zero longitudinal momentum transfer the
interaction potential of two membranes moving with the relative transverse velocity v and
separated by a distance r reads [13]

it would be interesting to extend these scattering potential calculations to cases involving
longitudinal momentum exchange, recoil eects, etc. in view of relation eq. (4), one also
expects agreement in these cases. note that the equivalence between two supergravi-
ties holds for arbitrary n, but in establishing the relation between m-atrix theory and
sugra/sym duality we use only the equivalence for large n.7

let us conclude by summarizing our arguments. m-atrix theory conjecture implies the
equivalence of strongly coupled one dimensional sym and 11-d light-cone supergravity.
on the other hand, sugra/sym duality implies the equivalence of one dimensional
sym and 11-d supergravity on a spatial circle in sen-seibergs limit. we proved that the
hamiltonian of 11-d supergravity on a light-like circle is equal to a limit of the hamiltonian
of 11-d supergravity on a spatial circle. in this way, we have shown that large-n, low
energy version of m-atrix theory and sugra/sym duality are equivalent in the one
dimensional sym case.

711-d supergravity on a light-like circle at nite-n is not necessarily the same as the low energy limit
of dlcq m-theory [16] and therefore the equivalence of two supergravities at nite-n is useless for our
purposes.
