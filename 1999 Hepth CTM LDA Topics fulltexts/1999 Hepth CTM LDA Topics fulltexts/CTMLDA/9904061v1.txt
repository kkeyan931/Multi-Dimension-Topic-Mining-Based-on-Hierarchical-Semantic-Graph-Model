abstract

we calculate in dimensions d = 2 +  and in light-cone gauge (lcg) the per-

turbative o(g4) contribution to a rectangular wilson loop in the (t, x)-plane
coming from diagrams with a self-energy correction in the vector propagator.

in the limit   0 the result is nite, in spite of the vanishing of the triple vec-
tor vertex in lcg, and provides the expected agreement with the analogous

calculation in feynman gauge.

i. introduction

su(n) yang-mills (ym) theories exhibit peculiar and interesting features in 1+1 di-

mensions (d = 2). the reduction from four to lower dimensions entails indeed tremendous

simplications, so that many problems can be faced, and often exactly solved [1], [2], [3].

for instance exact evaluations of vacuum to vacuum amplitudes of wilson loop operators,

that, for a suitable choice of contour and in a particular limit, provide the potential between

a static qq pair [4], [5], [6], can be obtained.

ym theories without fermions in 1+1 dimensions are considered free theories, apart from

topological eects. this feature looks apparent when choosing an axial gauge. however,

either when matter elds are introduced, or in wilson loop calculations, the perturbative

1 + 1 dimensional theory exhibits dramatic infrared (ir) singularities which need to be regu-

larized. unfortunately the results appear to be dependent on such regularization procedures,

even when they concern gauge invariant quantities [7].

in light cone gauge (lcg) the (ir) singular behaviour is particularly apparent in the

vector propagator, where the gauge pole conspires with the usual feynman singularity to

produce a double pole [8].

a cauchy principal value (cpv) prescription for this ir singularity has often been

advocated [9]. it emerges quite naturally if the theory is quantized on the light cone surface

x+ = 0 [10].

on the other hand such a recipe is at odds with wicks rotation. in ref. [11] a causal

prescription for the double pole has been proposed, which is nothing but the one suggested

years later by mandelstam and leibbrandt (ml) [12], when restricted to 1 + 1 dimensions.

this prescription follows from equal-time quantization [13] and is mandatory in order to

renormalize the theory in 1+3 dimensions [14], [10].

in view of the above-mentioned results and of the fact that pure ym theories do not

immediately look free in feynman gauge, a systematic investigation has been undertaken

to clarify their properties when the two dimensional picture is reached starting from higher

2

dimensions.

since no exact solutions are available beyond d = 2, the investigation has been focussed

on perturbative calculations, looking for consistency checks, in particular testing the gauge

invariance of the theory which holds order by order in the coupling constant expansion.

recalling that perturbative s-matrix elements cannot be consistently dened in non-

abelian gauge theories, owing to their (ir) singular mass-shell behaviour, the natural gauge

invariant quantities to be considered are wilson loops.

a rst test of gauge invariance in 1 + 3 dimensions has been performed in refs. [15,16]
by calculating at o(g4), both in feynman and in light-cone gauge with ml prescription,
a rectangular wilson loop with light-like sides, directed along the vectors n = (t,t ),
n
 = (l, l) and parametrized according to the equations:

c1 : x(t) = nt,

c2 : x(t) = n + nt,

c3 : x(t) = n + n(1  t),
c4 : x(t) = n(1  t),

0  t  1.

(1)

in order to perform the test, dimensional regularization (d = 2) was used for both uv

and ir singularities. full consistency between feynman and light-cone gauge with the ml

prescription was obtained.

since results in 2 dimensions were available, in view of the peculiar features of yang-

mills theories in 2 dimensions mentioned above, the interest arose in knowing the outcome

of the check in the limit   1. the following unexpected results were obtained in [17].

the o(g4) perturbative loop expression in d = 1 + (d  1) dimensions is nite in the
limit d  2. the loop expression is a function only of the area n  n for any dimension d
and exhibits also a dependence on ca, the casimir constant of the adjoint representation.

in lcg this dependence comes from two sources:

 diagrams with two crossed propagators (colour factor cf (cf  ca/2), cf being the

casimir constant of the fundamental representation);

3

 a genuine contribution to the wilson loop proportional to cf ca coming from the

one-loop correction to the vector propagator (self-energy diagram).

we shall concentrate our interest on the contribution due to this self-energy diagram.

at a rst sight, it is surprising, since, in 1+1 dimensions, there is no triple vector vertex in

axial gauges. what happens is that the vanishing strength of the vertex at d = 2 matches

the self-energy loop singularity, eventually producing a nite result. feynman diagrams

with a triple vertex but no loops tend instead smoothly to zero when inserted in the wilson

contour.

we notice that no ambiguity aects the o(g4) gauge invariant result, which is nite; in
addition the presence of ca cannot be re-absorbed by a redenition of the coupling, that,

while unjustied on general grounds, would also turn out to be dependent on the area of

the loop.

in order to clarify whether the appearance of ca in the maximally non-abelian term

is indeed a pathology, one should examine the potential v (2l) between a static qq pair

in the fundamental representation, separated by a distance 2l. therefore in ref. [18] we

have considered a dierent wilson loop, viz a rectangular loop with one side along the space

direction and one side along the time direction, of length 2l and 2t respectively. eventually

the limit t   at xed l is to be taken: the potential v (2l) between the quark and
the antiquark is indeed related to the value of the corresponding wilson loop amplitude

w(l, t ) through the equation [19]

t w(l, t ) = const. e2it v (2l) .
lim

(2)

the crucial point to notice in eq.(2) is that dependence on the casimir constant ca should

cancel at the leading order when t   in any coecient of a perturbative expansion of
the potential with respect to coupling constant. this criterion has often been used as a

check of gauge invariance [10].

in ref. [18] the calculation has been performed in feynman gauge, obtaining the following

results.

4

for d > 2 the o(g4) perturbative expression of the loop depends, besides on the area,
also on the ratio  = l/t . as we are eventually interested in the large-t behavior, we have

always considered the region  < 1; moreover we have chosen d = 2 +  with a small  > 0.

as long as d > 2, agreement with abelian-like time exponentiation (alte) occurs in

the limit t  , with a pure cf -dependence in the leading coecient. consistency of all
previous results [10] in higher dimensions is thus re-established.

the limit d  2 for  = 0 exactly reproduces the gauge invariant result obtained in
ref. [17] for a loop of the same area with light-like sides; thereby we enforce the argument

that in two dimensions a pure area behaviour is expected, no matter the orientation and the

shape of the loop. what may be surprising is that the term, which in lcg corresponds to

the self-energy correction, exhibits, in the limit, a pure area dependence on its own.

however, in two dimensions at o(g4), a ca-dependence is denetely there and agreement
with alte is lost. actually this behaviour at d = 2 persists at any order of g and aects

the sum of the perturbative series [20], [3].

a peculiar feature of the light-cone gauge in 2 dimensions is that individual wilson loop

diagrams do not exhibit any singularity; hence there is no need of dimensional regularization.
in ref. [21], a o(g4) perturbative calculation of the wilson loop in lcg with ml pre-
scription, for a rectangular loop with sides 2t  2l lying in the x0  x1 axes, was performed
at d = 2. no agreement occurs with the result one nds in ref. [18] when taking the limit

d  2. the source of such a discrepancy is rooted in the mentioned self-energy diagram
contribution, which is obviously missing at d = 2, but provides a nite term in the limit

d  2, thereby producing a discontinuity in the theory [17].

the purpose of this paper is to check explicitly this property by evaluating in lcg the

relevant discontinuity for the wilson loop of ref. [21]. we conrm that the missing term

comes from the diagram with a self-energy corrected propagator, evaluated at d = 2 + ,

when eventually taking the limit   0. we thereby reproduce for a space-time contour the
phenomenon in lcg found in ref. [17] for a contour with light-like sides. actually, from

the computation of the self-energy diagram at d > 2, we nd, as an extra bonus, that its

5

contribution vanishes for  > 0 in the limit t   with the same universal factor t 44
we have obtained in ref. [18] for the maximally non-abelian contributions [22].

the limits t   and   0 do not commute.

ii. the calculation

we recall some basic notions and notations. we consider, as in ref. [18], the closed path

 parametrized by the following four segments i,

1 : 

1 (s) = (st, l) ,

2 : 

3 : 

2 (s) = (t,sl) ,
3 (s) = (st,l) ,
4 (s) = (t, sl) ,

4 : 

1  s  1.

(3)

describing a (counterclockwise-oriented) rectangle centered at the origin of the plane (x1, x0),

with length sides (2l, 2t ), respectively.

the perturbative expansion of the wilson loop is

w(l, t ) = 1 +

1
n



xn=2

(ig)ni

dx1

1   i

dxn

n (x1 >    > xn)tr[g1n(x1,   , xn)] , (4)

where g1n(x1,   , xn) is the lie algebra valued n-point green function, and the heavy-
side -functions order the points x1,   , xn along the integration path .

it is easy to show that the perturbative expansion of w is an even power series in the

coupling constant, so that we can write

w(l, t ) = 1 + g2w2 + g4w4 + o(g6) .

(5)

to have a sensitive check of gauge invariance, one has to consider at least the order g4,

(i.e. one has to evaluate w4), as this is the lowest order where genuinely non-abelian cf ca
contributions may appear. in turn, in the calculation of w4, only the so called maximally
non-abelian contribution w na
4 need to be evaluated, that in our case comes from the terms

6

proportional to cf ca. the abelian contribution, proportional to c 2

f , can be easily obtained

thanks to the abelian exponentiation theorem [22].

the diagrams contributing to w na

4

can be grouped into three families: a) crossed dia-

grams (c(ij)(kl)), with a double gluon exchange in which the two (crossed) propagators join
the sides (ij) and (kl) of the contour ; b) spider diagrams (sijk), which are obtained by
attaching a three point green function at the tree level to the sides (ijk) of the loop; c)

bubble diagrams (bij) , that are single exchange diagrams in which the gluon propagator,
corrected by a self-energy term, joins the sides (ij) of the contour.

in arbitrary dimensions, the calculation of the wilson loop is much more awkward in

lcg than in covariant gauge, due to a more complicated form of the vector propagator.

however, when considering the d  2 limit, diagrams in lcg have much better analyticity
properties in  than the ones in feynman gauge. the vector propagator in lcg with ml

prescription is a tempered distribution at d = 2, at odds with the one in feynman gauge.

moreover it is summable along the (compact) loop contour.

due to this property, we can conclude that all the maximally non-abelian contributions

arising from diagrams with crossed propagators sum to an expression that, in the limit

d  2, reproduces the result of ref. [21], namely

w cr = cacf

(lt )2

3

.

(6)

now we consider the contribution w bub coming from bubble diagrams. in lcg and on
the plane x0  x1, the only non-vanishing component of the two point green function 
at the order o(g2) is ++(x)  (x), that reads, at x = 0 [16],
(x2 + i)22 f () ,

(8)

following the notations of ref. [18], there are 10 topologically inequivalent bubble diagrams.

however, due to the symmetry of the green function and to the symmetric choice of the

7

contour, only six of them are independent, and the o(g4) contribution to the wilson loop
arising from bubble diagrams can be written as

w bub = 2(b11 + b22 + b13 + b24 + 2b12 + 2b14) ,

(9)

where each single contribution bij can be calculated by replacing eqs. (3), (7) in the formula

where  = l/t .

some comments are here in order. first of all there is a dependence on the dimensionless

ratio , besides the area, at variance with the analogous result in lcg for the rectangle

of light-like sides. however, in the equation above, one can easily check that the quantity
w bub/(lt )2 is not singular for   0. actually eq.(11) exhibits, for  > 1, the expected
damping factor t 44 in the large-t limit.

in the limit   1 the dependence on  disappears and the pure area law is recovered:
w bub = cf ca(lt /)2. this is exactly the missing term to be added to the expression
of ref. [21] to obtain the nal result for the maximally non-abelian contribution to the
perturbative o(g4) wilson loop in the limit d  2,

(12)

equation (12) is in full agreement not only with ref. [18], where an anologous wilson loop

was calculated in feynman gauge, but also with ref. [17], where the loop was oriented in a

dierent direction. moreover, in lcg, dierent families of diagrams (crossed and bubble

diagrams) give the same contribution (cf ca

(lt )2

3

respectively) no matter

 (cid:17)2
and cf ca(cid:16) lt

the orientation of the loop: remarkably, invariance under area-preserving dieomorphisms

is recovered in the limit d  2, even when the wilson loop is rst evaluated in higher
dimensions, and then the limit d  2 is taken.

in turn the result above implies that spider diagrams, namely diagrams with a triple

vector vertex, cannot contribute in the limit d  2. this is not surprising, as the same
phenomenon occurred in ref. [17], although for a dierent contour (contour with light-like

sides).

in order to support this conclusion, we show that the relevant three point green function

at o(g), vanishes when d  2.

to this aim, let us consider the three point green function v(x, y, z). due to the lcg
choice, its only non-vanishing component when considering the loop in the x0  x1 plane is
v(x, y, z) = v+++(x, y, z); up to an irrelevant multiplicative constant, it is given by

v(x, y, z) = z d2

(15)

let us consider, for instance, the rst term in eq. (13), that we call v1. using standard
feynman integrals techniques, integrations over momenta and over the intermediate point

 can be performed, so that v1 can be rewritten, after some convenient change of variables,
as

(16)

since v1 has an explicit zero at  = 1, if we show that the integral in (16) is convergent
when evaluated at  = 1, we have proved that the three point green function vanishes at

d = 2. integral (16) is discussed in the appendix.

iii. conclusions

a peculiar feature of the light-cone gauge formulation of yang-mills theories is that they

can be consistently dened in two dimensions: contrary to the covariant feynman gauge,

the light-cone gauge propagator with ml prescription for the spurious pole is a tempered

distribution at d = 2.

in particular, the large t behaviour of the wilson loop can be

evaluated without the need of introducing any regulator; the nite result has been presented

in ref. [21]. this result, however, cannot be compared with the result one would obtain in

feynman gauge, as in the latter case, the free propagator is not a tempered distribution

at d = 2.

in feynman gauge the best one can do is to evaluate the wilson loop in d

dimensions, and to take eventually the limit d  2.

in so doing one obtains again a nite result [18] that, however, is dierent from the one

of ref. [21]. in lcg the diagram with a self-energy correction in the propagator, which only

exists in d > 2, makes the dierence. it is precisely the contribution we have evaluated in

this paper. it provides us with the missing term to get agreement between refs. [21] and [18],

i.e. to recover gauge invariance. such a phenomenon was not unexpected in the light of ref.

[17]. perturbative yang-mills theory in lcg looks indeed discontinuous in the limit d  2;

10

actually, starting from a vanishing coupling at d = 2, it exhibits a kind of instability with

respect to a change of dimensions.

on one hand our result claries the nature of the discontinuity of yangmills theories in

two dimensions, on the other it rises new interesting questions for future investigations.

while in any dimension d > 2 perturbative wilson loop calculations are in agreement

with abelian-like time exponentiation, as all ca dependent terms turn out to be depressed

in the large-t limit, at d = 2 neither the result in ref. [21] nor the one in [18] share this

property, as they both exhibit an explicit ca-dependence in the coecient of the leading

term when t  . at d = 2 exponentiation in terms of cf occurs perturbatively only
in light-front formulation (ref. [8]); in equal-time quantization, exponentiation requires full

resummation of genuine non-perturbative contributions (instantons) [3].

the dierence between the formulations above (and their related vacua) as well as the

reason why this phenomenon seems to be crucial only at d = 2 are under active investigation.

appendix:

in this appendix we show that the three point green function tends to zero when d  2.
as explained in the main text, it is sucient to prove that the integral in eq. (16), with

the constant containing the simple zero (  1) factorized out, is convergent when evaluated
at  = 1. such an integral, after the change of variables  = ,  = (1  ) and after
explicit integration over d, reads

(a1)

 being the heavyside function. the most delicate region of this integral is     0, so
that in order to check convergence of eq. (a1) we can restrict ourselves to the case when the

curly bracket is replaced by one. after this replacement, we set  =  and  = (1  ).
in the expression obtained after this change of variables, we rescale  =  at xed  .

11

the integral over the  variable can be factorized providing a factor log(1 + 1/). finally,

renaming  = 1/, eq. (a1) with the curly bracket replaced by one can be equivalently

written as

i = z 1

dividing the  integration domain as [0, 1]  [1,), we split i as i1 + i2. in i1,   [0, 1]
and therefore we can use the following majorations: log(1 + ) <  and (1 + )3 < 1. thus,

integration in d is straightforward, providing us with the estimate

a = (1  )(x  y)+/(x  z)+ ,
b = (x  y)+/(z  y)+ ,
c = (1  )(x  y)2/[(x  z)2 + (1  )(y  z)2  i] .

(a3)

(a4)

in this form, it is manifest that integration over  is convergent. the explicit result goes

beyond the purpose of the paper, but it can be easily evaluated providing combinations of

rational functions, logarithms and dilogarithms.

in i2, the  integration domain is [1,) and therefore we can use (1 + )3 < 3. thus,

the  dependent part of the integrand can be approximated by

( + a)( + b)2

(a5)

to check convergence, in the second term of the r.h.s. we can replace log(1 + )/ by 1.

then, integration over  becomes straightforward and the second term in eq. (a5) provides

12

integrals over d of the same kind of those in i1, where convergence can be easily checked.
the rst term in the r.h.s. of eq. (a5) is more delicate. here the majoration log(1 + ) < 

is too strong as it would spoil convergence in the  integration. an explicit integration over
