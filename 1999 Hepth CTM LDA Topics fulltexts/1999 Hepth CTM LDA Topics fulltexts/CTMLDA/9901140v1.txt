abstract

the concept of perturbative gauge invariance formulated exclusively by means of asymp-
totic elds is used to construct massive gauge theories. we consider the interactions of r
massive and s massless gauge elds together with (r + s) fermionic ghost and anti-ghost
elds. first order gauge invariance requires the introduction of unphysical scalars (gold-
stone bosons) and xes their trilinear couplings. at second order additional physical scalars
(higgs elds) are necessary, their coupling is further restricted at third order. in case of one
physical scalar all couplings are determined by gauge invariance, including the higgs poten-
tial. for three massive and one massless gauge eld the su (2)  u (1) electroweak theory
comes out as the unique solution.

1 introduction

in gauge theories with massive gauge bosons the masses are conventionally generated by the

higgs mechanism [1]. one introduces scalar elds into the theory which have asymmetric self-

interactions so that some physical scalar eld gets a symmetry breaking vacuum expectation

value (higgs eld). then the gauge symmetry is spontaneously broken and the gauge elds can

acquire mass. here the notion gauge symmetry refers to the symmetry of the total action.

for various reasons there are still considerable doubts whether the above picture is really

fundamental, one being the ad-hoc character of the construction. however, it is possible to

consider massive gauge theories from a quite dierent point of view. if one takes the adiabatically

switched s-matrix s(g) (g(x) a schwartz test function) as the basic object, dened by the

perturbation series [2]

s(g) = 1 +



xn=1

1

n! z d4x1 . . . d4xn tn(x1, . . . , xn)g(x1) . . . g(xn),

(1.1)

then one would like to formulate gauge invariance in terms of the time-ordered products tn.

since the latter are expressed by the asymptotic free elds, it is a priori not clear whether such

a perturbative denition of gauge invariance is possible. we have found that this is indeed the

case [3], no matter if the gauge elds are massless or massive [4]. the denition of perturbative

gauge invariance reads as follows

dqtn

def= [q, tn] = i

n

xl=1


x
l

t 
n/l(x1, . . . xl . . . xn).

(1.2)

here q is the nilpotent gauge charge, rst introduced by kugo and ojima [5], and the t 

n/l are

time-ordered products with a so-called q-vertex at xl. these quantities are dened in the next

section and in sect.3.

the idea of the paper is to start from a general ansatz for t1(x) and to use perturbative

gauge invariance (1.2) to determine the coupling parameters in t1. this is a straightforward

generalization of [4] with the merit that in the more general framework the discussion is simpler

and more transparent. the general ansatz contains massless and massive gauge elds and

2

ghosts, as well as unphysical (goldstone bosons) and physical scalar (higgs) elds. in contrast

to standard theory of spontaneous symmetry breaking where the scalar elds are members of

some multiplet, we treat the unphysical and physical scalars completely free and independent.

this turns out to be natural because their couplings come out quite dierent: the coupling of

the unphysical scalars is (up to mass dependent factors) given by the structure constants fabc of

the gauge group lie algebra (sect.3), whereas the higgs couplings are of a dierent diagonal type

(sect.4). nevertheless, in the case of one physical scalar the resulting couplings are in agreement

with the usual theory, including the asymmetric higgs potential (sect.5). for more than one

higgs eld their couplings are not completely determined by gauge invariance.

as a consequence of perturbative gauge invariance we nd many relations between the masses

of the gauge elds and the structure constants fabc. as an application we consider in sect.6 the

physical case of three massive gauge elds and one massless (photon) eld and ask the question:

what are the possible gauge theories ? the relations of gauge invariance enables us to calculate

the fabc in terms of the masses. the unique result is the usual su (2)  u (1) electroweak theory.

in this way the standard theory looses its ad-hoc character.

the same problem has recently been considered by d.r. grigore [6] using a dierent denition

of gauge invariance. most of his results are in agreement with ours, only his treatment of the

higgs elds is misleading.

2 a general massive gauge theory

we consider r massive and s massless gauge elds a

a , a = 1, . . . , r + s together with (r + s)

fermionic ghost and anti-ghost elds ua, ua. these free asymtotic elds are quantized as follows

( + m2

a)a

a (x) = 0, [a

a (x), a

b (y)] = iabg dma(x  y),

( + m2

a)ua(x) = 0 = ( + m2

a)ua(x)

{ua(x), ub(y)}+ = iabdma(x  y),

3

(2.1)

(2.2)

(2.3)

all other commutators vanish, dm are the jordan-pauli distributions. the masses of a gauge

eld and the corresponding ghost and anti-ghost elds must be equal, otherwise perturbative

gauge invariance cannot be achieved. we have ma = 0 for a > r.

in order to get a gauge charge q which is nilpotent

q2 = 0,

(2.4)

we have to introduce for every massive gauge vector eld a

a (x), a  r, a scalar partner a(x)

with the same mass ma. the scalar elds are quantized according to

( + m2

a)a(x) = 0, [a(x), b(y)] = iabdma (x  y).

(2.5)

then the gauge charge q is dened by

q def= z d3x (a

a + maa)


 0ua.

(2.6)

calculating q2 as one half of the anticommutator {q, q} one easily veries the nilpotency (2.4).

the scalar and ghost elds appearing in q (2.6) are all unphysical because their excitations

do not belong to the physical subspace [7]

hphys = kerq.ranq.

(2.7)

to discuss this in detail it is necessary to introduce a concrete representation of the various

asymptotic elds in fock space. we want to avoid that to stress the fact that our denition of

gauge invariance refers to a structural property independent of representation. then we simply

call a eld unphysical if it appears in q (2.6), otherwise it is physical. for the gauge elds that

means  a is unphysical. second order gauge invariance will force us to introduce additional

physical scalar elds p, p = 1, . . . , t, called higgs elds, with arbitrary masses p. we shall

use indices p, q, . . . = 1, . . . t from the end of the alphabet to number the higgs elds, letters

h, j, k, l, . . . = 1, . . . r from the middle denote the other massive elds and a, b, c, d, e, f, . . . =

1, . . . r + s is used for unrestricted color indices.

with this eld content we are going to analyse the following trilinear couplings:

t1(x) = t 0

1 + t 1

(2.9)

(2.10)

(2.11)

(2.12)

(2.13)

where f 4

hjk is totally symmetric in h, j, k and g is a coupling constant. all f s are real because t1

must be skew-adjoint. for reasons of economy we assume the pure yang-mills coupling fabc in

(2.9) to be totally antisymmetric. if one starts with the most general ansatz, one must repeat the

discussion in [8] to derive the antisymmetry. the jacobi identity need not be assumed, it follows

explicitly below in second order (sect.4.1). in t 1

1 we have only considered the antisymmetric

combination because the symmetric one can be expressed by a divergence

a

a (hj + jh) = (a

a hj)  a

a hj.

the remaining a

a term is a coboundary dq(uahj) plus terms of the form t 3

1 , t 4

1 . but

divergence and coboundary couplings can always be skipped in the discussion of perturbative

gauge invariance [9].

the higgs couplings are obtained by replacing the scalar elds in (2.10-13) by higgs elds:

(2.18)

where f 11 is totally symmetric. all products of eld operators throughout are normally ordered

(wick) products of free elds. interacting elds do not appear at all.

3 first order gauge invariance

the gauge charge q (2.6) denes a gauge variation according to

dqf def= qf  (1)nf f q,

(3.1)

where nf is the number of ghost plus anti-ghost elds in the wick monomial f . we get the

following gauge variations of the fundamental elds

dqa

a (x) = iua(x),

dqh(x) = imhuh(x)

dqua(x) = 0,

dq ua(x) = i(a

a (x) + maa(x))

dqp = 0.

(3.2)

(3.3)

(3.4)

these innitesimal gauge transformations have some similarity with the brst transformations

[10], but we emphasize the following dierences. the brst transformations are dened for

interacting elds, whereas we work with asymptotic free elds only and establish gauge invariance

order by order. brst invariance only holds if the quadratic free lagrangian, the gauge xing

term and the quartic term in the action are also transformed. we have no such terms in t1 (2.8)

so that the compensations of terms in the gauge variations are totally dierent.

we now calculate the gauge variation of all terms in t1 and transform the result to a diver-

gence form

dqt1 = it 

1/1.

(3.5)

6

the t 

1/1 appearing here is the q-vertex. it is not unique, but the possible modication has

no inuence on gauge invariance of higher orders [9]. the most convenient way to achieve the

divergence form (3.5) is to take out the derivatives of the ghost elds and use the eld equations.

in this way we nd:

we have succeeded in expressing all couplings so far by fabc. with these results all remaining

terms without higgs couplings cancel.

we next turn to the higgs couplings. from a

f 7
abp = mbf 5

abp,

f 7
abp = 0

for a > r

or

b > r,

and from a

abp = mbf 5

and =0 for b > r. finally the terms  uahp give

f 9
ahp =

(3.24)

(3.25)

and zero for a > r. we see that the higgs couplings are not completely xed by rst order

gauge invariance. so far the higgs couplings could be set equal to zero, but then we would nd

a breakdown of gauge invariance at second order.

4 second order gauge invariance

following the inductive construction of epstein and glaser [2] in the case of t2, we have rst to

calculate the causal distribution

d2(x, y) = t1(x)t1(y)  t1(y)t1(x).

(4.1)

it has a causal support ( {(xy)2  0}) and must be decomposed into a retarded and advanced

part: d2 = r2  a2, suppr2  v +, suppa2  v . for diagrams with singular order   0 [11]

this distribution splitting is not unique. there are undetermined local terms



x|a|=0

cada(x  y) : o(x, y) :

a = (a)

9

in r2 which are called normalization terms (or nite renormalization terms in the old terminol-

ogy). da = q a

we obtain t2 = r2  r

2, where r

2(x, y) def=  t1(x)t1(y).

x is a partial dierential operator and : o(x, y) : is a wick monomial. finally,

the main problem is whether gauge invariance can be preserved in the distribution splitting.

obviously, d2 (4.1) is gauge invariant:

dqd2(x, y) = [dqt1(x), t2(y)] + [t1(x), dqt2(y)] =

= ix

[t 

1/1(x), t1(y)] + iy

[t1(x), t 

1/1(y)] def= ix

d

2/1(x, y) + iy

d

2/2(x, y).

(4.2)

since the retarded part r2 agrees with d2 on the forward light cone x  x + (v + \ {0}) and

similarly for r

2/1, r

2/2, gauge invariance of r2 can only be violated by local terms  da(xy).

but such local terms also appear as normalization terms in the distribution splitting if the

singular order is  0. if the normalization terms n2, n 

2/1, n 

2/2 can be chosen in such a way

that

dq(r2 + n2) = x

(r

2/1 + n 

2/1) + y

(r

2/2 + n 

2/2)

(4.3)

holds, then the theory is gauge invariant to second order. note that the distribution t2 =

r2 + n2  r

2 then fulls (4.3), too, because r

2 is clearly gauge invariant for the same reason as

in (4.2). the local terms on the right-hand side of (4.3), which come from the causal splitting,

are called anomalies. the ordinary axial anomalies are of the same kind, they appear in the

third order triangle diagrams with axial vector couplings to fermions (see [12], sect.4). the

dierence is that the axial anomalies cannot be removed by nite renormalizations.

to prove (4.3) we only have to consider its local part. we concentrate on the tree graphs

because gauge invariance is not a serious problem for second order loop graphs. let r2 be the

splitting solution of d2 obtained by replacing dm(x  y) by dret

m (x  y). since dq operates

only on the eld operators, the local part on the left-hand side of (4.3) is only due to dqn2. to

calculate the anomalies on the right-hand side of (4.3) we start from

d

2/1

def= [t 

1/1(x), t1(y)].

(4.4)

10

the anomalies come from those terms in t 

1/1 (3.17) which contain a derivative . these are the

second and third term in (3.17.1), the rst term in (3.17.2), the rst two in (3.17.4) and the rst

in (3.17.5). we shall abbreviate these terms by 17.1/2... 17.5/1 in the following. commuting

the factors with derivative  in these terms with all terms in t1(y) (2.9-20) we get tree-graph

contributions with four external legs (sectors) which we now have to examine.

4.1 sector uauu:

these eld operators come out if we commute the second term in (3.17.1) with the second one

in (2.9)

(17.1/2)  (2.9/2) = ifabcfdef aaub[a

c (x), ad(y)]ue uf ,

(4.5)

where we set the coupling constant g = 1 from now on. this gives a result  

x d(x  y). after

splitting this causal distribution we get the retarded part 

x dret(x  y). if now the derivative

x
 of (4.2) is applied

we get a local term



x dret(x  y) = m2dret + (x  y)

a1 = fabcfcef aaubue uf (x  y)

(4.6)

(4.7)

which is the anomaly. the second term in (4.2) with x and y interchanged gives the same

contribution so that we notice the short rule

d(x  y)  2(x  y)

(4.8)

for the following. proceeding in the same way with the third term in (3.17.1) commuted with

the second one in (2.9) we get

(17.1/3)  (2.9/2) = fabcfdcf uaub uf ad(x  y).

(4.9)

there are no further contributions in this sector so that (4.7) must cancel against (4.9) in

order to have gauge invariance. we interchange the indices of summation b and e in (4.7)

2a1 = (fabcfcef + faecfcbf )ubue uf aa

11

and add (4.9), then the total anomaly becomes

(fabcfcef + faecfcbf  febcfacf )ubue uf aa.

(4.10)

taking the total asymmetry of fabc into account the bracket vanishes i the jacobi identity is

satised

4.2 sector uaaa:

as the foregoing one this is a pure yang-mills sector. from the commutator between (3.17.1/2)

and (2.9/1) we get three contributions

(17.1/2)  (2.9/1) = fabcaaub(x)nfcef aea

f d + fdcf ada

f d

(4.11)

+fdeca

d(y)ae

x 

y d(x  y)o.

here in the last term we have a new situation because the distribution d has singular

order 0. consequently its retarded part dret + 1g contains a free normalization term

which is part of n 

2/1 in (4.3), 1 is a free parameter. applying the external derivative  we

get local terms of the following form

g(x)f (y)

y (x  y) + 1

y [g(x)f (y)].

(4.12)

in the -term we use the identity

f (x)g(y)

x (x  y) + f (y)g(x)

y (x  y) =

= f (x)(g)(x)(x  y)  (f )(x)g(x)(x  y).

(4.13)

here we have added the other anomaly with x and y interchanged which comes from r

2/2.

similarly, the normalization term of divergence form in (4.12) will be transformed with help of

the relation


x [f (x)g(y)(x  y)] + 

y [f (y)g(x)(x  y)] =

= (f )(x)g(x)(x  y) + f (x)(g)(x)(x  y).

(4.14)

12

summing up, we have the following short rule for the calculation of this type of local terms:

g(x)f (y)

x 

y d(x  y)  h(1 + 1)gf + (1  1)gfi(x  y).

using this in (4.11) we get the following total result for the local terms

f + fdcf ada

= fabcaaub(x)nfcef aea
+fabcfdecn(1 + 1)(ubaa + ubaa)a
e )o.

+(1  1)ubaa(a

from the vanishing of the term  ubaaa

da

e we conclude

(1  1)fabcfdec = 0,

(4.15)

(4.16)

(4.17)

which implies 1 = 1. then the terms  uba

f aa cancel due to the jacobi identity. but

the term  ubaaa

da

e does not vanish

(1 + 1)fabcfdec = 41.

here a normalization term n2 in (4.3) is necessary. in fact, the 4-boson coupling

with the gauge variation

dqn1 = 41uba

e aaa
d

(4.18)

(4.19)

(4.20)

gives just the desired local term. such a normalization term (4.19) is indeed possible because the

rst term in (2.9) commuted with itself gives the following second order tree graph contribution

d2 = fabcfdef aaaa[a

c (x), a

f (y)]adae.

the commutator   d(x  y) has singular order 0 again, which allows the normalization

term (4.19). 1 = 1 in (4.18) xes 1:

n1 =

(4.21)

this is the mechanism how additional couplings are generated by gauge invariance. note that

in (4.17) no normalization term is possible.

for later use we list the form of all possible normalization terms. they come from second

order tree graphs with two derivatives on the inner line:

(2.9)  (2.9) : aaaa, (2.10)  (2.10) : aa, (2.10)  (2.14) : aa,

(2.14)  (2.14) : aa, aa, (2.14)  (2.15) : aa, (2.15)  (2.15) : aa.

(4.22)

in addition we shall need three further normalization terms

, , .

they are produced by fourth order box diagrams with all derivatives on inner lines.

(4.26)

in choosing dierent parameters 1, . . . 4 we have split every tree graph contribution separately.

if we sum the terms with the same eld operators before splitting, we have one  only, but the

results remain the same as we are now going to show.

subtracting (4.24) from (4.23) and (4.26) from (4.23) and subtracting the two resulting

equations we obtain

f 6
aqpf 5

dkp = 0.

here the sum goes over p = 1, . . . t and can be regarded as a scalar product of two vectors in

rt. we will see below (see (4.44)) that the vectors (f 5

dk)p are non-zero. we make the weak

assumption that there are t linear independent vectors (f 5

dk)p for dierent d, k, then it follows

f 6 = 0. subtracting (4.23) from (4.25) we conclude

(4.31)

if we write a summation symbol then only the indicated index is summed over. for a, b, j all

dierent, fabj denes a non-singular matrix and the mass-dependent factor does not alter that.

consequently f 5 vanishes for dierent indices, only f 5

jjp, j = 1, . . . r are dierent from 0. that

means the higgs couplings are diagonal, in contrast to the couplings of the unphysical scalars

which are non-diagonal.

that f 5 6= 0. this follows from the following sector.

(4.44)

the r.h.s. is known and generally dierent from 0, consequently f 5 must be also dierent from

0. in case of only one higgs eld t = 1, the higgs coupling f 5 can be calculated from (4.44)

as a square root. for t > 1 the higgs couplings are no longer uniquely determined by gauge

invariance. for xed j equation (4.44) holds for all h 6= j and gives the same value on the l.h.s.

this implies relations between the masses and the yang-mills couplings (see sect.6).

(4.63)

5 third order gauge invariance

instead of (4.4) we now have to look for local terms  8(x  z, y  z) in

d

3/1(x, y, z) = [t 

1/1(x), t2(y, z)] + [t1(y), t 

2/1(x, z)] + [t1(z), t 

2/1(x, y)]

d

3/2(x, y, z) = [t 

1/1(y), t2(x, z)] + [t1(x), t 

2/1(y, z)] + [t1(z), t 

2/2(x, y)]

d

3/3(x, y, z) = [t1(x), t 

2,2(y, z)] + [t1(y), t 

2/2(x, z)] + [t 

1/1(z), t2(x, y)]

(5.1)

(5.2)

(5.3)

where t2 refers to the inverse s-matrix [11]. the rst term in (5.1) produces a local term if

the second term in (3.17.1) is commuted with the second order normalization term (4.21). the

latter contains (y  z) and the commutator  d(x  y) gives another (x  y) by the usual

mechanism (4.8). the result is

(17.1/2)  (4.21) = 2fabcfcbefadeubaaa

aaba

d(x  y)(y  z).

(5.4)

to examine the second term in (5.1) we use the fact that t 

2/1 = t 

2/1 + . . . plus terms

which give to local contribution. from (4.19) we have

t 
x

2/1(x, z)|loc = 2fabcfdecuba

e aaa

d(x  z).

(5.5)

21

if this is commuted with the second term in (2.9), the anti-ghost - ghost contraction has two

derivatives so that the resulting c-number distribution has  = 0 and, after splitting, allows a

normalization term

(2.9/2)  (5.5) = 2ifabbfabcfdecubaaa

e aaa

d(y  x)(x  z).

(5.6)

after renaming the summation indices this has the same form as (5.4). however, the contri-

butions from the second and third member in (5.1) cancel each other and similarly in (5.2).

but in (5.3) these normalization terms survive and after suitable choice of  in (5.6) compen-

sate the anomaly (5.4). then the sector uaaaa is gauge invariant. the situation is the same

in the other sectors uaa, uaa and uaa containing as. here, instead of n1 the

normalization terms n2, n3 and n4 come into play.

next we turn to the sector u3 where we get two anomalies

(3.17.4/1)  (4.61) = f 5

ahp6(j, p, u)uah2

j u

(3.17.4/2)  (4.58) = 2f 5

ahp5(h, j)uah2

j p.

(5.7)

they must cancel each other because no normalization term is possible. this leads to the

relation

t

xq=1

f 5
aaq6(j, q, p) = 2f 5

aap5(a, j).

(5.8)

in case of one physical scalar (t = 1) this allows to determine the pure higgs coupling f 11 in 6

(4.62). similarly, in the sector u3 we nd the relation

2

t

xv=1

f 5
aav7(v, p, q, u) = f 5

aap6(a, q, u),

(5.9)

which, for t = 1, determines the quartic higgs coupling (4.63). the remaining sectors u4

and u22 are automatically gauge invariant due to the facts that 5 (4.60) is constant and

6(h, p, q) (4.62) is independent of h.

it is instructive to discuss the important special case t = 1 of one physical scalar in detail.

then (5.8) can be simplied as follows

6(j, 1, 1) = 25(a, j),

22

which, by (4.60) and (4.62), leads to

f 11
ppp =

(5.10)

here p is the higgs mass and a is arbitrary. from (5.9) we get

(5.12)

(5.13)

introducing the coupling constant g again, we must multiply (5.12) by g and (5.13) by g2/2!

because this is the second order contribution. then the total scalar potential is equal to

23

(5.15)

(5.16)

the higgs potential (5.15) assumes a symmetric double-well form

v  (cid:16) 2 + xj

2  a2(cid:17)2

.

the shifted higgs eld then has a non-vanishing vacuum expectation value a (5.16), so that we

have recovered (i.e. actually deduced) the usual higgs mechanism.

6 derivation of the electroweak gauge theory

let us seek all gauge theories with three massive gauge elds m1, m2, m3 6= 0 and one massless

photon eld m4 = 0. there are many 4-dimensional lie algebras, but we will see that gauge

invariance is strong enough to x the fabc uniquely.

we put a = 4, d = 2, j = 1, h = 2 in (4.43)

(6.1)

since the bracket is dierent from zero, we must either have f243 = 0 or f321 = 0. we shall

verify below that the second alternative leads to the trivial solution f = 0 so we concentrate on

the rst case. for a = 4, d = 1, h = 2, j = 1 we nd from (4.43)

(6.2)

(6.3)

(6.4)

if the r.h.s. is dierent from zero we have f124 6= 0, otherwise the solution would be trivial. then

it follows from (3.19) that m1 = m2 which is the equal mass of the w-bosons. this simplies

(6.4) as follows

(cid:16) f124
f123(cid:17)2

=

m2
3
m2
1

 1,

which implies m3 > m1. dening the weak mixing angle  by

we have

m1
m3

= cos ,

(cid:16) f124
f123(cid:17)2

= tan2 .

(6.5)

(6.6)

since a common factor in the f s can be absorbed in the coupling constant g, we end up with

f124 =  sin ,

f123 =  cos 

(6.7)

in agreement with the weinberg-salam model [13, 14]. all other structure constants follow by

asymmetry. the signs in (6.7) have been chosen according to standard convention, as well as

m3 for mz. of course any permutation of the indices 1,2,3 is possible, but the solution remains

the same.

it remains to discuss the possibility f123 = 0. then it follows from (6.3) that m1 = m2 = m3

and |f124| = |f134|. if we now put a = h = 4 and d = j = 1 in (4.43) we arrive at

0 =

hence, all f s vanish in this case.

it is not hard to verify that for the unique non-trivial solution (6.7) all conditions for gauge

invariance are satised. by means of (6.7) all couplings can be calculated in the case of one higgs

eld and are in complete agreement with the standard electroweak theory [15]. but we could

use any number t  1 of higgs elds. only for t = 1 the couplings are completely determined

by gauge invariance.

in the same way one can construct the gauge theory with only two massive gauge elds

m1, m2 6= 0 and one massless eld m3 = 0. this is not the su (2) higgs-kibble model often

discussed in the literature [16] which has three massive elds. it turns out that m1 = m2 must

be equal, so that this theory is a hypothetical electroweak theory without neutral currents.

therefore, the gauge principle cannot explain why there are neutral currents in nature.
