abstract

extended brst invariance (brst plus anti-brst invariances) provides in principle a nat-
ural way of introducing the complete gauge xing structure associated to a gauge eld theory in
the minimum representation of the algebra. however, as it happens in topological yang mills
theory, not all gauge xings can be obtained from a symmetrical extended brst algebra, where
antighosts belong to the same representation of the lorentz group of the corresponding ghosts.
we show here that a eld redenition makes it possible to start with an extended brst algebra
with symmetric ghost antighost spectrum and arrive at the gauge xing action of topological
yang mills theory.

it was shown by witten [1, 2] how to build up a quantum eld theory involving the vector
gauge potential whose partition functional generates topological invariants like the donaldson
polynomials. soon after that, baulieu and singer[3] have shown that this, so called topological
yang mills theory, can be obtained by an appropriate gauge xing of the topological invariant
classical action

their approach was to quantize the action (1) along the standard brst prescriptions but
writing out the brst transformations of the gauge elds as the sum of the brst transfor-
mations of standard yang mills theory plus a topological ghost  that by itself removes the
degrees of freedom associated with the gauge eld a

a =  + dc .

(2)

then the eld content of the theory is enlarged in order to gauge x the action, taking into
account the reducibility of (2). also the topological yang mills action was obtained from a
brst quantization procedure in an alternative way by labastida and pernici[4].

the quantization procedure of ref. [3] is completely based on the sole brst invariance of
the gauge xing action. the antighosts and auxiliary elds are introduced as trivial pairs. they
do not belong to the minimum representation of the brst algebra. it is known however [5] that
one can associate to any classical gauge symmetry an extended brst (brst plus anti-brst)
algebra. one of the advantages of considering an extended algebra rather than a standard one
is that the antighosts and auxiliary elds enter in this formulation as basic ingredients of the
minimum representation of the algebra and not just as trivial pairs. the idea of introducing anti
brst transformations in topological yang mills theory was discussed in refs. [6] , [7] and [8].
an extended brst algebra associated with this theory was then presented in ref. [9]. however,
in this reference the connection with the action of baulieu and singer is only possible by means
of a gauge xing action involving terms with dierent scaling dimensions. they also use some
eld redenitions that do not preserve the dimension and the number of degrees of freedom.

the standard way of introducing the anti-brst transformations is to dene them in a sym-
metric way with respect to the brst ones. following this approach one introduces antighosts
in the same representation of the lorentz group as the corresponding ghosts. this would corre-
spond, in the case of the topological yang mills theory to an extended brst algebra that can
be written as[9]

1a =  + dc

21 = 1  [c, 1]  [c, ]
22 = 2(cid:16)  [ c, ]  [c, 2](cid:17)
2 = 2(cid:16)  [ c, ]  [c, ](cid:17)
2b = 2  2(cid:16)[ c, c](cid:17)
2k = 2(cid:16)d + [c, ] + [c, ](cid:17)

where we are representing brst and anti-brst transformations respectively as 1 and 2 and
[ , ] means a graded commutator.

this symmetric approach leads to a simpler algebraic structure for the extended algebra.
however, in general not all gauge xings of a gauge theory can be implemented by using just
this kind of symmetrical ghost antighost pairs. this is precisely what happens in topological
yang mills theory. in order to enforce the self duality condition on f one has to introduce
a self dual anti symmetric antighost tensor + corresponding to the ghost vector [3]. the
dierence between the so called geometrical antighosts, like 
, that come from a symmetrical
extended formulation and the actual gauge xing antighosts, like + , normally introduced as
parts of trivial brst doublets was discussed in [10]. this reference introduces a general method
for starting with a completely symmetrical set of geometrical ghost antighost pairs and then,
by adding some trivial brst doublets, arrive at a gauge xing action corresponding to some
particular gauge xing. the idea there is to include some appropriate terms in the action that
will have the role of eliminating the unwanted variables from the model by a supersymmetric
compensation in the functional integration. this general mechanism is called a transmutation
of geometrical antighosts into gauge xing antighosts.



we will show here that it is possible to start with the symmetric ghost antighost set of
algebras of eqs. (3) and (4) and redene the elds in such a way that an extended algebra

3

involving the gauge xing antighost emerges. the topological yang mills action is then build
up from a double (brst anti-brst) variation of a gauge xing boson. let us consider the
following eld redenitions:

 = 
k = k



 + d+
 + db+

 + d
 + dd .

 and b+

where +
 are anti symmetric self dual tensor elds carrying three independent compo-
nents each one. the primed elds are necessary in order to nd a representation for the extended
brst algebra at interacting level and are assumed to vanish when the coupling constant goes
to zero. (in other words, explicitely including the coupling constant g, omitted in the article
for simplicity, we would have:  = g 
 + d and the same kind of thing for k).
equations (5) are just shifting the eld  , separating the four components in three of +

plus one of . observe that this shift in the rst of equations (5) generates a new symmetry.
the new ghosts of the second equation have precisely the role of xing this symmetry.

associated to this new set of elds we nd the following extended algebra:

and the anti brst transformation for k
 can be calculated from 12 = 0 . then we
consider the gauge xing of topological yang mills action (1) by adding the gauge xing action

sgf =  z d4x 1 2

t r(cid:16) aa + (c   )1

 c (c +  )(cid:17) ,

(8)

where all the terms have the appropriate scaling dimension. this action is dierent from the
one in [9] that involves the brst anti-brst variation of a sum involving terms aa and
f f that have dierent scaling dimensions. this would make sense only if one includes
additional dimensionfull parameters. also our eld redenition (5) is dierent from the one in
[9], where + was introduced as the exterior derivative of , although these two quantities
have dierent scaling dimensions.

using (6) and (7) , we nd after redening the elds as in (5):

sgf = z d4x t r(cid:16) ak + ad ( d  b)  adb+

this action represents a complete gauge xing of the topological action (1). we can now see
what happens in the limit of weak coupling constant. in this case all the interaction terms and
also the elds 

 vanish. in order to compare with ref[3] we can redene the elds:

path integration over the elds  and  leads to functional deltas in d and . thus, integrating
over this four elds we arrive at the total action

this is the weak coupling limit of the action found in reference [3]. thus we see that the
(5) provide a simple way of separating the relevant variables, that

eld redenitions of eq.
implement the gauge xing conditions (at weak coupling)

a = 0 ; f + f = 0 ;  = 0

(13)

from the other unnecessary variables. it is interesting to note also the way that the  and 
elds cancel just the unwanted parts of  and k .

the consistency of our procedure can be checked by looking at the dimensions of the elds:

[ a ] = [ c ] = [c ] = [ +
[  ] = [ 
] = [  ] = 2



 ] = [  ] = [  ] = 1

[  ] = 0
[  ] = [ b ] = [ b ] = [ d ] = 2
[  ] = [ k ] = 3

(14)

comparing our results with those of ref.[10] one sees that here the gauge xing action is
both brst and anti brst exact while there the action is only brst exact. also, one sees
that here the antighost +

 comes from a shift in .
