a complete global analysis of spatiallyat, fourdimensional cosmologies derived from the type
iia string and mtheory eective actions is presented. a nontrivial ramondramond sector is
included. the governing equations are written as a dynamical system. asymptotically, the form
elds are dynamically negligible, but play a crucial role in determining the possible intermediate
behaviour of the solutions (i.e.
the nature of the equilibrium points). the only past-attracting
solution (source in the system) may be interpreted in the elevendimensional setting in terms of at
space. this source is unstable to the introduction of spatial curvature.

i. introduction

there are ve anomalyfree, perturbative superstring theories [1]. it is now widely believed that these theories
represent special points in the moduli space of a more fundamental, nonperturbative theory known as mtheory [2].
(for a review see, e.g., ref. [3]). moreover, another point of this moduli space corresponds to elevendimensional
supergravity. this represents the lowenergy limit of mtheory [2,4].

the original formulation of mtheory was given in terms of the strong coupling limit of the type iia superstring.
in this limit, an extra compact dimension becomes apparent, with a radius, r, related to the string coupling, gs,
by r  g2/3
[2]. the compactication of mtheory on a circle, s1, then leads to the type iia superstring. in this
framework, the dilaton eld of the tendimensional string theory is interpreted as a modulus eld parametrizing the
radius of the eleventh dimension.

s

this change of viewpoint reestablishes the importance of elevendimensional supergravity in cosmology and has
interesting consequences for the dynamics of the very early universe. an investigation into the dierent cosmological
models that can arise in mtheory is therefore important and a number of solutions to the eective action have
recently been found [58].

the bosonic sector of elevendimensional supergravity consists of a graviton and an antisymmetric, threeform
potential [9]. the purpose of the present paper is to employ the theory of dynamical systems to determine the
qualitative behaviour of a wide class of fourdimensional cosmologies derived from this supergravity theory. we
compactify the theory to four dimensions under the assumption that the geometry of the universe is given by the
product m4  y 6  s1, where m4 is the fourdimensional spacetime, y 6 represents a sixdimensional, ricciat
internal space and s1 is a circle corresponding to the eleventh dimension. we assume that the only nontrivial
components of the eld strength of the threeform potential are those on the m4  s1 subspace.
the outline of the paper is as follows. in section ii we derive an eective, fourdimensional action by employing
the duality relationship in four dimensions between a pform and a (4  p)form. the eld equations for the class
of spatially isotropic and homogeneous friedmannrobertsonwalker (frw) universes are derived in section iii
and expressed as a compact autonomous system of ordinary dierential equations. all of the equilibrium points of
the system and their stability are determined in section iv. a complete analysis of the at cosmological models is
presented in section v together with a discussion and interpretation of the results. the robustness of the models
is addressed in section vi wherein a number of generalizations (i.e. additional degrees of freedom) are included; in
particular curvature eects are considered. we conclude with a discussion in section vii.

the rst line in eq. (2) contains the massless excitations arising in the neveuschwarz/neveuschwarz (nsns)
sector of the type iia superstring and the second line is the ramondramond (rr) sector of this theory [1]. in
general, the nsns elds couple directly to the dilaton eld in the string frame, but the rr elds do not.

we now consider the compactication of theory (2) to four dimensions. the simplest compactication that can be
considered is on an isotropic sixtorus, where the only dynamical degree of freedom is the modulus eld parametrizing
the volume of the internal space. we therefore assume that the stringframe metric (4) has the form

s = g(s)

(5)

where ij (i, j = 1, . . . , 6) is the sixdimensional kronecker delta and  represents the modulus eld.

moreover, we compactify the formelds in eq. (2) by assuming that the only nontrivial components that remain
after the compactication are those associated with the external spacetime m4. this implies, in particular, that the
chernsimons term is unimportant, since it is proportional to f  f . the eective fourdimensional action is then
given in the string frame by

that

eqs. (12) and (13) into the remaining eld equations for the graviton, dilaton and modulus elds implies that they

kaloper, kogan and olive have considered the equivalent compactication of the mtheory eective action (1)
directly in terms of elevendimensional variables when m4 corresponds to the spatially at frw spacetime [7]. in
this case, the only nontrivial components of the fourform eld strength that can exist entirely on the subspace
m4  s1 are f0mnp and fmnp, where m = (1, 2, 3), etc. the former represent the nontrivial components of the rr
fourform eld strength in eq. (15) and the latter are equivalent to those of the nsns threeform eld strength.
the scale factors of the universe in the string and mtheory interpretations are related by eqs. (3) and (4). these
relationships provide the recipe that allows the type iia string cosmologies to be reinterpreted in terms of eleven
dimensional, mtheory models. it can be veried by direct comparison that for k = 0, eqs. (18a)(18e) are formally
equivalent to the eld equations derived in ref. [7]. the advantage of employing the string-frame variables in this
work is that the rst derivative of the shifted dilaton eld (17) is a dominant variable and this greatly simplies the
analysis of the global dynamics.

to proceed, we dene a new time variable, :

the system of equations (18) then becomes:

where a prime denotes dierentiation with respect to  and the hamiltonian constraint (18e) has been employed to

since q2 is semipositive denite, it follows from eq. (24) that  is a dominant variable in the spatially at and
negatively curved models (k  0). in addition, it follows from eqs. (22) and (24) that  is a monotone function. this
is important because it implies the global result that  is either monotonically increasing or decreasing throughout
the evolution of the models. (the variable  plays an analogous role to that of the expansion parameter in the
spatially homogeneous perfect uid models of general relativity [16]).

we therefore introduce the new dimensionless time variable,  , according to

iv. structure of state space and local analysis

in this section we present all of the equilibrium points that arise in the system (28). we are primarily interested
in the spatially at models. however, we also consider the stability of these models to perturbations in the spatial
curvature. the local stability analysis we perform is valid for both positive and negative spatial curvature, although
we explicitly consider the k  0 models since in this case the condition   0 implies that all of the dimensionless
variables are bounded. the physical state space is dened by

and a global analysis can therefore be undertaken.

0 <(cid:8)x2, y2, z, u(cid:9) < 1

(31)

we include the boundary of the state space in our analysis because the dynamics in the invariant boundary
submanifolds is useful in determining the global properties of the orbits in the physical phase space. the boundary
of the state space consists of a number of invariant submanifolds of the system. they are: (i) models where the axion
eld is trivial ( = 0), (ii) the spatially at models (u = 0), and (iii) models where z = 0, corresponding to the
case where the fourform eld strength, f, is dynamically unimportant. the system of equations also admits an
invariant submanifold, k, that is not part of the boundary of state space:
k : x + 2y + 3 = 0 , u = 0 .

(32)

the equilibrium points are:

equilibrium set: the line l+

x2 + y2 = 1 , z = 0 , u = 0 ;  = 0 .

1 = 0 , 2 = 2(3x + 1) , 3 = 1 + 3x

where i denote the eigenvalues. the zero eigenvalue indicates that this is indeed an equilibrium set, corresponding
to a circle of unit radius in the (x, y) plane. we refrain from presenting the eigenvectors, but note that it is the

5

eigendirection associated with 3 that points in a direction outside the submanifold z = 0, while the eigenvector of
4 extends into the u direction. the stability of these equilibria is discussed in the following section2.

the saddle point m corresponds to the milne form of at space. this may be mapped onto the future light cone of
the origin of minkowski spacetime and in this sense may be interpreted as the string perturbative vacuum represented
in terms of nonstandard coordinates.

v. dynamics of the spatially flat cosmologies

a. global analysis

in this section we consider the global dynamics of the spatially at cosmologies (k = 0, u = 0). for these models,

the state space is threedimensional and the orbits can therefore be represented pictorially.

the only equilibrium points in the spatially at models lie on the line l+ and the eigenvalues are given in section

iv. from these eigenvalues, it can be seen that this line is a sink for x > 1/3 and 2y > x  1/3. the lines
x = 1/3 and 2y = x  1/3 intersect on l+ at the point p : (x, y) = (1/3,p2/3), at which all three

eigenvalues are zero. hence, p is a non-hyperbolic equilibrium point. all other points on l+ are saddles.

it can be shown that the point p is a source in the three-dimensional phase space. it follows from eqs. (28a) and

(28b) that

d

z(cid:19)

(33)

for u = 0. this implies that x+2y +3 is a monotonically increasing function in the physical phase space. the term
(1  x2  y2  1
2 z) is positivedenite in the interior region and can only be zero on the boundary, where x2 + y2 = 1
and z = 0. the term x +2y +3 is positivedenite in the physical state space and can only vanish in the extended
phase space at the point p . indeed, the line x + 2y = 3 is tangent to the unit circle x2 + y2 = 1 and z = 0

and actually touches it at the point p . we may conclude, therefore, that the non-hyperbolic equilibrium point p is
indeed a source for the three-dimensional system. we have veried this by analysing the equilibrium point p using
spherical polar coordinates and by numerical calculations.

the dynamics on the boundary of the state space is also important when interpreting the behaviour of the orbits.
the boundary consists of the two invariant submanifolds  = 0 and z = 0. the  = 0 (trivial axion eld) submanifold
can be solved analytically in terms of the variables of the state space and the solution is given by

2for hyperbolic equilibrium points the stability is determined by the signs of the real parts of the associated eigenvalues; in
the case of a source (past attractor) all are positive and in the case of a sink (future attractor) all are negative. otherwise, the
point is a saddle. if the real part of any of the eigenvalues of an isolated equilibrium point is zero, it is non-hyperbolic and the
stability cannot be determined directly from the eigenvalues.

x0  3

,

(34)

where (x0, y0) represents the initial point of the orbit. thus, orbits follow straight line paths in the (x, y) plane.
moreover, since by denition x < 3, this variable is a monotonically decreasing function on this submanifold and
y is a monotonically increasing function. the line l+ is a source for x > 1/3 and 2y < x  13 and a sink

otherwise.

the boundary z = 0 describes models where the fourform eld strength is dynamically negligible. this submanifold

can also be solved exactly and the orbits follow the straight line paths:

y =

y0(x + 3)
x0 + 3

,

(35)

where (x0, y0) again represents the initial point of the orbit. in this case, the function x is monotonically increasing

on this submanifold. the line l+ is a source for x < 1/3 and a sink otherwise.

the timereversed dynamics of the  > 0 models we have considered thus far is equivalent to the dynamics of the

case where  < 0. this follows by redening the time variable,  :

d
d

=  ,

(36)

so that  and  are both increasing or both decreasing together. if we dene the other state variables as in eq.
(29), the variables x and y for  < 0 are now the reections of the variables x and y for  > 0, i.e., x  x and
y  y. with the new time variable (36), the evolution equations (28) will have an overall change in sign, i.e.,
dx/d  dx/d , etc. thus, the equilibrium points are identical in both cases, but the eigenvalues have opposite
signs. consequently, the dynamics of the  < 0 models is the time reversal of the  > 0 models, where contracting
models for  > 0 are expanding models for  < 0, and vice versa.

the equilibrium set l+ represents solutions where the formelds are trivial and only the dilaton and moduli elds
are dynamically important. these are known as the dilatonmodulivacuum solutions and have an analytical form
given by

e = e|t|h
e = e|t|3h1
)/6,

e = e|t|(13h2

(37)

where {, , , h} are constants, and  = 1. note that the  solutions in eq. (37), which are represented by
the line l+, correspond to t < 0 and, in the time-reverse case (  < 0), the + solutions of eq. (37) correspond to
t > 0.

let us rst consider the dynamics in the invariant submanifold z = 0, where the nsns axion eld is nontrivial and
the rr fourform eld strength vanishes (fig. 1). these trajectories represent the dilatonmoduliaxion solutions
discussed in ref. [17]. the trajectory along y = 0 corresponds to the solution where the internal dimensions are
static. in this case, the universe is initially contracting (x < 0), but ultimately bounces into an expansionary phase
(x > 0). the bounce is induced by the twoform potential. it follows from eq. (12) that the eld strength of this
antisymmetric tensor eld is directly proportional to the volume form of the threespace. this implies that the axion
eld may be interpreted as a membrane that is wrapped around the spatial hypersurfaces [18]. this membrane resists
the initial collapse of the universe and results in a bouncing cosmology. many solutions exhibit such a bounce, but
others collapse to zero volume. these arise when the initial kinetic energy of the modulus eld (internal space) is
suciently high that it can always dominate the kinetic energy of the axion eld.

in the other invariant submanifold ( = 0), the nsns twoform potential is trivial, and the rr threeform
potential is dynamical. the cosmological constant term q2 in the eective action (15) may be interpreted as a 0form
eld strength. in a certain sense, this degree of freedom plays a role analogous to that of a domain wall3 [19]. however,
in contrast to the membrane associated with the axion eld, this domain wall resists the expansion of the universe.
thus, the majority of solutions that are initially expanding ultimately recollapse, as shown in fig. 2. there are some

dimensions.

solutions where the internal space is initially evolving suciently rapidly that the modulus eld dominates the form
eld and the expansion can proceed indenitely. solutions that are initially collapsing do not undergo a bounce.

in both invariant submanifolds, the point p corresponds to an endpoint on the line of sources. in fig. 1, the
reection of this point in the line y = 0 represents the opposite end of the line of sources. this point corresponds to
a dual solution, where the radius of the internal space is inverted. thus, the endpoints of the line of sources in the
invariant submanifold z = 0 are related by a scale factor duality.

we may now consider the dynamics in the full threedimensional phase space, where both the nsns twoform
potential and rr threeform potential are dynamically signicant. although they are asymptotically negligible, the
interplay between these elds has important consequences. the key point is that the rr eld causes the universe to
collapse, but the nsns eld has the opposite eect. these two elds therefore compete against one another, as can
be seen in figs. 3 and 4.

the point p is the only source in the system when both form elds are present. furthermore, it follows from
the denitions (26) that it represents the collapsing, isotropic, tendimensional cosmology, where  = . the four
dimensional dilaton eld, , is trivial in this case. as the collapse proceeds, a typical orbit moves upwards in a
cyclical fashion until a critical point is reached, where one of the form elds is able to dominate the dynamics. the
orbit then shadows the corresponding trajectory in the invariant submanifold z = 0 or  = 0. in fig. 3, the axion
eld dominates and causes the universe to bounce. by this time, however, the kinetic energy of the modulus eld has
become signicant and the solution ultimately asymptotes to a dilatonmodulivacuum solution on l+.

all sinks in this phase space correspond to solutions where the internal dimensions are expanding (y > 0). there is
a particular point where the spatial dimensions spanning the spacetime m4 become static in the latetime limit. in
general, however, solutions either collapse to zero volume in a nite time or superinate ( > 0) towards a curvature
singularity. in this sense, they correspond to prebig bang cosmologies, since the comoving hubble radius decreases
[15,20]. however, since the internal space is expanding, it is not clear to what extent this behaviour represents a
realistic, fourdimensional inationary solution.

as discussed above, the time-reversed dynamics of the above class of models is deduced by interchanging the sources
and sinks and reinterpreting expanding solutions in terms of contracting ones, and viceversa. thus, the late-time
attractor for the timereversed system is the expanding, isotropic, tendimensional cosmology located at point p .

it is of interest to reinterpret the equilibrium points of the phase space in terms of elevendimensional solutions.
since the elevendimensional threeform potential is trivial on l+, these points represent kasner solutions to eleven
dimensional, vacuum einstein gravity. thus, the line l+ is analogous to the kasner ring that arises in the vacuum
bianchi i models of fourdimensional general relativity [16].

0 + 62

0 + 2

0 = 1.

for the compactication we have considered, the scale factors in the elevendimensional frame are {e , e , e},
where, from eq. (4),     /2 and     /2. the kasner solutions are then given by the power laws
 = 0/t,  = 0/t and  = 0/t, where t  r dt exp(/2) and the constants of integration satisfy the constraints
30 + 60 + 0 = 1 and 32

these redenitions imply that the source p corresponds to the kasner solution (0, 0, 0) = (0, 0, 1). this point
represents the taub form of minkowski spacetime [16]. the relevance of this solution to the problems associated
with the prebig bang curvature singularity have recently been discussed [7,8], and it is interesting from an eleven
dimensional point of view that such a simple solution is uniquely selected by the dynamics. the endpoints of the line
of sinks on l+ correspond to the kasner solutions (1/2, 0,1/2) and (0, 2/7,5/7), respectively, and consequently
in both cases a subset of the scale factors are static.
this concludes our discussion of the phase space for the spatially at cosmologies. in the following section, we
consider the robustness of these models to a number of possible generalizations, including the eects of spatial
curvature.

vi. robustness of the models

a. eects of spatial curvature

although the compactness of the phase space depends on the fact that k  0, one can assume arbitrary signs for
k in order to determine the local stability of the equilibrium points in the three-dimensional set u = 0 with respect
to curvature perturbations. the eigenvalue associated with u for the equilibrium points l+ is always negative. this
means that the sinks on l+ (i.e., points on l+ for x > 1/3 and 2y > x  1/3) remain sinks in the four-

dimensional phase-space. in addition, this implies that the point p is now only a saddle; that is, the stability of p is
unstable to the introduction of both positive and negative spatial curvature.

10

since a portion of l+ acts as sinks in the four-dimensional phase space, there exists the global result that the
corresponding dilatonmodulivacuum solutions (37) (for 3  >   and 6  > 3   ) will be attracting solutions
for the spatially curved models. we may deduce further global results by restricting our attention to the negatively
curved models (k < 0), in which case the four-dimensional phase space is compact. as discussed above, the point
p is a only a saddle point in this extended phase space. moreover, it follows from the analysis of section iv that
the only attracting equilibrium point is the point r. (there is an additional saddle m which will aect the possible
intermediate dynamics). this source corresponds to a negatively curved model with a trivial axion eld; indeed, it is
a power-law, self-similar collapsing solution with non-negligible modulus and rr formeld.

we have been unable to nd a monotone function on the extended four-dimensional phase space, but it is plausible
that all negatively-curved models evolve from the solution corresponding to the global source r towards the dilaton
modulivacuum solutions (on the attracting portion of l+). clearly the curvature is dynamically important at early
times.

in the time-reverse case, the solutions asymptote from the non-inationary dilatonmodulivacuum solutions in the
past and evolve to the future towards a curvature dominated model; it is plausible that they evolve towards a model
which is the time-reversal of the one represented by r. therefore, curvature can also be dynamically important at
late times.

b. eects of generalized couplings

we now consider a generalization of the eective action (15) given by

s =z d4xg(cid:26)e(cid:20)r + ()2  6 ()2 

1
2

e2 ()2  2(cid:21) 

1
2

q2ec(cid:27) ,

(38)

where  represents a cosmological constant term and c is an arbitrary constant. the former term may arise through
nonperturbative corrections to the string eective action. the motivation for considering an arbitrary coupling of
the modulus eld to the fourform eld strength is that the generality of the dynamics discussed in section iv (in
which c = 6) can be investigated. eq. (38) reduces to the action studied in ref. [21] when c = 0.

by invoking the same assumptions as in section iii, the action (38) reduces to

s =z dt(cid:20)e(cid:16)3 2  2 + 6ke2 + 6 2  2(cid:17) +

1
2

e+6 2  q2ec+3(cid:21) ,

(39)

and the corresponding eld equations can again be derived from this action. in analogy with eqs. (23) and (28), we
introduce a new time variable,  , dened by

and the new reduced variable

d

1 e 1

2 (c++3) d

v =

2e(3++c)

()2

.

,

(40)

(41)

from these denitions and the reduced variables dened earlier, we obtain a ve-dimensional system of ordinary
dierential equations for the reduced (dimensionless) variables after eliminating the variable  that is now dened by
  1  x2  y2  z  u  v. since   0, all of the dimensionless variables are bounded for the models with k  0
and  > 0, where the physical state space is dened by 0 < (cid:8)x2, y2, z, u, v(cid:9) < 1, and a global analysis is therefore
possible in this case. including the boundaries  = 0, z = 0, u = 0 and v = 0 leads to a compact state space.

we can analyse these models and obtain qualitative information about the dynamics in an analogous way to
that done in section iii [22]. the equilibrium set l+: x2 + y2 = 1, z = u = v = 0 still exists, and since the
eigenvalues associated with (u and) v are (both) negative, part of l+ will act as sinks and the non-hyperbolic point

x = 1/3, y = p2/3, z = u = v = 0 is clearly a saddle. these are local results and are valid in all cases.

there also exists an attracting equilibrium point w :

with eigenvalues

x = 

3(cid:0)12 + c2(cid:1) d2 , y = 8c6d2 , z = 192cd4 , u = v = 0 ,

(42)

2cd2 , (c pc(17c2 + 924))d2 ,4(12 + c2)d2 , 6(12 + c2)d2 ,

11

where c  (c + 6)(c  6) and d2  108 + c2. note that this point corresponds to an exact self-similar collapsing
cosmological solution with nontrivial modulus and fourform elds. the value of  as a function of c is given by

 = 2c(60 + c2)
(108 + c2)2 ,

(43)

which implies that 6  c  6 in order for   0. when c = 6, the point w is a part of the equilibrium set l+;
in fact, it becomes just the non-hyperbolic point p discussed previously. note that it is also a part of the invariant
submanifold cx  62y + 3c = 0; u = v = 0, which generalizes the invariant submanifold k dened in eq. (32).
there are two non-at (u 6= 0) vacuum equilibrium points with a vanishing cosmological constant v = 0, one of
which is a source and the other a saddle. there is also a non-hyperbolic vacuum equilibrium point with a non-
vanishing cosmological constant (v = 1) with x = y = z = u = 0, which appears to be a source. in addition, we
can nd monotone functions in the boundary submanifolds; indeed, the boundary  = u = v = 0 and the boundary
submanifold z = u = v = 0 can be solved exactly in terms of the variables of the state space. exact solutions of the
equations of motion for particular values of c can also be found.

however, the primary motivation for these comments is to emphasize two important points regarding the very
interesting dynamics of the mtheory cosmologies studied earlier. first, we note that the conclusions obtained for
the spatially curved models are robust when additional physical elds (e.g., a  term) are included. second, and
perhaps more importantly, we see that the value c = 6 is a bifurcation value in the analysis of general models with
arbitrary coupling, c. in this context, therefore, the m-theory cosmological models we have studied exhibit rather
unique dynamics.

vii. discussion

in this paper we have presented a complete dynamical analysis of spatially at, fourdimensional cosmological
models derived from the m-theory and type iia string eective actions. we have shown that models generically
spiral away from a source p , undergoing bounces due to the interplay between the ns-ns two-form potential and the
rr three-form potential. eventually, they evolve towards dilaton-moduli-vacuum solutions with trivial form elds
(corresponding to the sinks on l+). we note the important dynamical result that  is monotonic.

thus, the form elds that arise as massless excitations in the type iia superstring spectrum, or equivalently from
the threeform potential of elevendimensional supergravity, may have important consequences in determining initial
and nal conditions in string and mtheory cosmologies, even though they are dynamically negligible in the early
and latetime limits. in particular, the point p is the only source in the system. it can be interpreted in the string
context as the isotropic, ten-dimensional solution. alternatively, it represents the taub form of at space when viewed
in terms of elevendimensional variables.

when the eects of spatial curvature are included, we obtained the local result that the point p becomes a saddle.
on the other hand, the dilaton-moduli-vacuum solutions with trivial form elds are generic attracting solutions. in
the analysis of the negatively-curved models, we found that the early time attractor (the source r) has non-zero
curvature, implying that spatial curvature is dynamically important at early times in these examples.

this work can be generalized in a number of ways. we considered a specic compactication from eleven to
four dimensions, where the topology of the internal dimensions was assumed to be a product space consisting of a
circle and an isotropic sixtorus. we emphasize, however, that the analysis also applies to compactications on a
calabiyau threefold since the gauge elds arising from the higherdimensional metric have been ignored [7]. the
qualitative analysis may be readily extended to compactications on a general, rectilinear torus s1  . . .  s1. after
suitable redenitions of the additional moduli elds that subsequently arise, the dimensionally reduced action can
be expressed precisely in the form of eq. (15), with the inclusion of a set of massless scalar elds in the nsns
sector. in particular, the compactication on t 4  t 2  s1, where t n represents the isotropic ntorus, is relevant
to compactications involving the fourdimensional space k3 [23]. this space has played an important role in
establishing various string dualities [3]. it is the simplest fourdimensional, ricciat manifold after the torus [24]
and may be approximated by the orbifold k3  t 4/z2 [25].
moreover, the eects of spatial anisotropy in the spacetime m4 can also be considered by introducing two, uncoupled
moduli elds into the nsns sector of the reduced action (16). in this context, such elds parametrize the shear in
the cosmologies. when these elds are nontrivial, the models represent the class of isotropic curvature cosmologies
and correspond to bianchi type i, v and ix universes [21,26]. it would be interesting to consider these generalizations
further.
