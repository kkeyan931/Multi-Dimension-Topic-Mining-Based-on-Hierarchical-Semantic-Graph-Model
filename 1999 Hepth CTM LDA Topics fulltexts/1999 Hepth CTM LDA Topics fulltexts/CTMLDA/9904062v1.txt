we study the relations between the equations of rst order lagrangian eld theory on ber
bundles and the covariant hamilton equations on the nite-dimensional polysymplectic phase
space of covariant hamiltonian eld theory. the main peculiarity of these hamilton equa-
tions lies in the fact that, for degenerate systems, they contain additional gauge xing
conditions. we develop the brst extension of the covariant hamiltonian formalism, char-
acterized by a lie superalgebra of brst and anti-brst symmetries.

i. introduction

as is well known, when applied to eld theory, the familiar symplectic techniques of
mechanics take the form of instantaneous hamiltonian formalism on an innite-dimensional
phase space. the nite-dimensional covariant hamiltonian approach to eld theory is vig-
orously developed from the seventies in its multisymplectic and polysymplectic variants.13
its nal purpose is the covariant hamiltonian quantization of eld theory.

in the framework of this approach, one deals with the following types of pdes: euler
lagrange and cartan equations in the lagrangian formalism, hamiltonde donder equa-
tions in multisymplectic hamiltonian formalism, covariant hamilton equations and restricted
hamilton equations in polysymplectic hamiltonian formalism. if a lagrangian is hyperreg-
ular, all these pdes are equivalent. the present work addresses degenerate semiregular and
almost regular lagrangians. from the mathematical viewpoint, these notions of degeneracy
are particularly appropriate in order to study the relations between the above-mentioned
pdes. from the physical one, lagrangians of almost all eld theories are of these types.

to formulate our results, let us recall briey some notions. given a ber bundle y  x,

coordinated by (x, yi), a rst order lagrangian l is dened as a horizontal density

l = l : j 1y 

n
 t x,  = dx1     dxn, n = dim x,

on the ane jet bundle j 1y  y , provided with the adapted coordinates (x, yi, yi
). j 1y
can be seen as a nite-dimensional conguration space of elds represented by sections of
y  x.

given a lagrangian l (1), the associated eulerlagrange equations dene both the equa-
tions of the variational problem on y for l and the kernel of the eulerlagrange operator,
which can be also introduced in an intrinsic way as a coboundary element of the variational
cochain complex.

the cartan equations characterize the variational problem on j 1y for the poincare
cartan form hl, which is a horizontal lepagean equivalent of l on j 1y  y , i.e. l =
h0(hl), where h0 is the horizontal projection (14). at the same time, the cartan equations
can be seen both as the kernel of the eulerlagrangecartan operator and the hamilton
equations of the lagrangian polysymplectic structure on j 1y . the cartan equations are
the lagrangian counterpart of covariant hamilton equations.

the hamilton-de donder equations and the covariant hamilton equations are related to

two dierent legendre morphisms in the rst order calculus of variations.

firstly, every poincarecartan form hl yields the legendre morphism chl of j 1y to the

homogeneous legendre bundle

zy = j 1y = t y  (

n1
 t x)

(2)

n+1
 -valued dual of j 1y  y ,1,4 and is treated as a homogeneous nite-
which is the ane
dimensional phase space of elds. zy is provided with the canonical exterior n-form y (28)

and the multisymplectic form dy . if chl(j 1y ) is an imbedded subbundle of zy  y , the
pull-back of y yields the hamiltonde donder equations on chl(j 1y ). if a lagrangian l

is almost regular, these equations are quasi-equivalent to the cartan equations, i.e., there
is a surjection of the set of solutions of the cartan equations onto that of the hamilton-de
donder equations.1

secondly, every lagrangian l denes the legendre map bl of j 1y to the legendre bundle

is a 1-dimensional ane bundle. given any section h of zy  , the pull-back

h = hy = p

i dyi    h

(6)

is a polysymplectic hamiltonian form on .24 the legendre  is equipped with the canoni-
cal polysymplectic form y (33).2,3 this form diers from those in refs. [4-6], and is globally
dened. with the polysymplectic form y , one introduces hamiltonian connections and co-
variant hamilton equations

h,

 = i
yi
p
i = ih,

(7a)

(7b)

which are pdes on the phase space  dened by the kernel of the hamilton operator eh (43).
if x = r, covariant hamiltonian formalism provides the adequate hamiltonian formulation
of time-dependent mechanics.10,11 in this case, zy = t y and  = v y are the homogeneous
and momentum phase spaces of time-dependent mechanics, respectively.

it should be emphasized that a hamiltonian form h (6) is the poincarecartan form of

the lagrangian

lh = h0(h) = (p

i yi

  h)

(8)

on the jet manifold j 1. it is the the poincarecartan form (17) of this lagrangian. it
follows that the eulerlagrange operator (19) for lh is precisely the hamilton operator eh
(43) for h and, consequently, the eulerlagrange equations for lh are equivalent to the
hamilton equations for h. the lagrangian lh plays a prominent role in the path integral
approach to quantization of hamiltonian systems.1214

the results of this paper demonstrate that polysymplectic hamiltonian formalism is not
equivalent to the lagrangian one, but can provide the adequate description of degenerate
eld systems which do not necessarily possess gauge symmetries.

we show that, if r : x   is a solution of the hamilton equations for a hamiltonian
form h associated with a semiregular lagrangian l and if r lives in the lagrangian con-

straint space bl(j 1y ), then the projection of r onto y is a solution of the eulerlagrange

equations for l. the converse assertion is more intricate. one needs a complete set of
associated hamiltonian forms in order to exhaust all solutions of the eulerlagrange equa-
tions for a degenerate lagrangian. it follows that the covariant hamilton equations contain
additional conditions in comparison with the eulerlagrange ones. in the case of almost reg-
ular lagrangians, one can introduce the constrained hamilton equations. they are weaker
than the hamilton equations restricted to the lagrangian constraint space, are equivalent
to the hamiltonde donder equations and, consequently, are quasi-equivalent to the cartan
equations.

the detailed analysis of degenerate quadratic lagrangian systems in section vi is ap-
propriate for application to many physical models. we nd a complete set of associated

3

hamiltonian forms. the key point is the splitting of the conguration space j 1y into the

dynamic sector and the gauge one coinciding with the kernel of the legendre map bl. as an

immediate consequence of this splitting, one can separate a part of the hamilton equations
independent of momenta which play the role of gauge-type conditions, while other equa-
tions restricted to the lagrangian constraint space coincide with the constrained hamilton
equations, and are quasi-equivalent to the cartan equations.

thus, we observe that the main features in gauge theory are not directly related to the
gauge invariance condition, but are common in all eld models with degenerate quadratic
lagrangians. the important peculiarity of the hamiltonian description of these models lies
in the fact that, in comparison with a lagrangian, an associated hamiltonian form h and
the lagrangian lh (8) contain gauge xing terms. therefore we will construct the brst
extension of the hamiltonian form h (6) and the lagrangian lh (8) in order to provide them
with symmetries which lead, e.g., to the corresponding slavnov identities under quantization.
this is a preliminary step towards the covariant hamiltonian quantization of degenerate
systems.

a natural idea of the covariant hamilton quantizations is also to generalize the poisson
bracket in symplectic mechanics to multisymplectic or polysymplectic manifolds and then
to quantize it.15 the main diculty is that the bracket must be globally dened. let us
note that multisymplectic manifolds such as (zy , dy ), look rather promising for algebraic
constructions since multisymplectic forms are exterior forms.1618

nevertheless, the above mentioned x = r reduction of the covariant hamiltonian for-
malism leads to time-dependent mechanics, but not conservative symplectic mechanics. in
this case, the momentum phase space v y , coordinated by (t, yi, pi = yi), is endowed with
the canonical degenerate poisson structure given by the bracket

{f, g}v = if ig  igif,

f, g  c (v y ).

(9)

however, the poisson bracket {h, f }v of a hamiltonian h and functions f on the momentum
phase space v y fails to be a well-behaved entity because h is not a scalar with respect to
time-dependent transformations. in particular, the equality {h, f }v = 0 is not preserved
under such transformations.10,11 as a consequence, the evolution equation in time-dependent
mechanics is not reduced to a poisson bracket. at the same time, the poisson bracket (9)
leads to the following current algebra bracket. let u = uii be a vertical vector eld on
y  r, and ju = uipi the corresponding symmetry current on v y along u. the symmetry
currents ju constitute a lie algebra with respect to the bracket

[ju, ju] = {ju, ju}v = j[u,u].

this current algebra bracket can be extended to the general polysymplectic case as follows.

4

there is the canonical isomorphism

 = p

i dyi   :   v y 
(

y

n1
 t x).

let u = uii be a vertical vector eld on y  x. the corresponding symmetry current (70)
is a horizontal exterior (n  1)-form

ju = u = uip

i 

(10)

on the legendre bundle  (3). the symmetry currents (10) constitute a lie algebra with
respect to the bracket

[ju, ju] def= j[u,u].

(11)

if y  x is a vector bundle and x is provided with a non-degenerate metric g, the bracket
(11) can be extended to any horizontal (n  1)-forms  =  on  by the law

[, ] = gg(i

i  i

i).

similarly, the bracket of horizontal 1-forms on  is dened.11 the bracket (11) looks promis-
ing for the current algebra quantization of the covariant hamiltonian formalism. we will
use this bracket in order to construct the algebra of supercurrents in the brst extended
hamiltonian formalism.

note that, since the above mentioned poisson bracket {h, f }v is not preserved under
time-dependent transformations, the standard brst technique, based on the lie algebra of
constraints, can not be applied in a straightforward manner to time-dependent mechanics
and covariant hamiltonian eld theory. we generalize the brst mechanics of e.gozzi and
m.reuter11,12,19 in the terms of simple graded manifolds.

ii. technical preliminaries

all maps throughout the paper are smooth, while manifolds are real, nite-dimensional,

hausdor, second-countable and connected. a base manifold x is oriented.

given a ber bundle y  x coordinated by (x, yi), the s-order jet manifold j sy
is endowed with the adapted coordinates (x, yi
), 0 |  | s, where  is a symmet-
ric multi-index (k...1), |  |= k. the repeated jet manifold j 1j 1y is coordinated by
(x, yi, yi

). there are the canonical morphisms

exterior forms  on a manifold j sy , s = 0, 1, . . ., are naturally identied with their
pull-backs onto j s+1y . there is the exterior algebra homomorphism, called the horizontal
projection,

h0 : dx + 

i dyi

 7 dx + 

i yi

+dx

(14)

which sends exterior forms on j sy onto the horizontal forms on j s+1y  x, and vanishes
on the contact forms i
+dx. note that the horizontal projection h0 and the
pull-back operation with respect to bundle morphisms over x mutually commute. recall
also the operators of the total derivative

 = dyi

d =  + yi

i =  + yi

and the horizontal dierential dh = dx  d such that h0  d = dh  h0.

we regard a connection on a ber bundle y  x as a global section

 = dx  ( + i

i)

(15)

of the ane jet bundle 1
y are called soldering forms. every connection  on a ber bundle y  x gives rise to the
connection

v  = dx  ( + i

on the ber bundle v y  x.

iii. lagrangian dynamics

we follow the rst variational formula of the calculus of variations.3 given a lagrangian
l and its lepagean equivalent hl, this formula provides the canonical decomposition of the
lie derivative of l along a projectable vector eld u on y in accordance with the variational
problem. we restrict our consideration to the poincarecartan form

hl = l + 

i i  ,

i = 


i l,  = .

(17)

in contrast with other lepagean equivalents, hl is a horizontal form on the ane jet bundle
j 1y  y . moreover, it is the lagrangian counterpart of polysymplectic hamiltonian forms
(see the relations (51) and (53) below). the rst variational formula reads

lj 1ul = uv el + dhh0(uhl),

where uv = (ui)i and

el = (i  d

i )li   : j 2y  t y  (

n
 t x)

6

(18)

(19)

is the eulerlagrange operator associated with l. the kernel of el denes the euler
lagrange equations on y given by the coordinate relations

(i  d

i )l = 0.

(20)

solutions of these equations are critical sections of the variational problem for the lagrangian
l.

remark 1: the rst variational formula (18) also provides the lagrangian conservation
laws.3,21 on-shell, we have the weak identity

and, if lj 1ul = 0, the weak conservation law

lj 1ul  dhh0(uhl),

0  dhh0(uhl) = dt 

of the symmetry current

t = h0(uhl) = t  = [

i (uyi

  ui)  ul]

(21)

(22)

along the vector eld u.

instead of the variational problem on y for a lagrangian l, one can consider that on
j 1y for the poincarecartan form hl (17). critical sections s : x  j 1y of this variational
problem satisfy the relation

s(udhl) = 0

(23)

for all vertical vector elds u on j 1y  x. this relation denes the cartan equations on
j 1y . we regain these equations in another way.3

let us consider the above-mentioned legendre map

the legendre bundle  (3) is equipped with the canonical tangent-valued liouville form

bl : j 1y

i  bl =

on j 1j 1y (see the notation (13)). the associated eulerlagrange operator, called the
eulerlagrangecartan operator for l, reads

(25)

j (byj

this is the lagrangian counterpart of the polysymplectic hamilton operator (see the relation
(55) below). its kernel ker el  j 1j 1y is given exactly by the cartan equations

j (byj

j = 0.

(26a)

(26b)

(27)

(29)

since el |j 2y = el, the cartan equations (26a)  (26b) are equivalent to the eulerlagrange
equations (20) on integrable sections of j 1y  x. these equations are equivalent in the
case of regular lagrangians.

with the poincarecartan form hl (17), we have the legendre morphism

chl : j 1y

zy ,

(p

i , p)  chl = (

i , l  

i yi

),

where the ber bundle zy (2) is endowed with holonomic coordinates (x, yi, p
readily observed that

i , p). it is

bl = z chl.

owing to the monomorphism zy 

n
 t y , the bundle zy is equipped with the pull-back

y = p + p

i dyi  

(28)

of the canonical form  on

let zl = chl(j 1y ) be an imbedded subbundle il : zl  zy of zy  y . it is provided

with the pull-back de donder form i

ly . we have

hl = ch 

ll = ch 

l(i

ly ).

by analogy with the cartan equations (23), the hamiltonde donder equations for sections
r of zl  x are written as

where u is an arbitrary vertical vector eld on zl  x. to obtain an explicit form of these
equations, one should substitute solutions (yi

, l) of the equations

r(udl) = 0

in the cartan equations. however, if a lagrangian l is degenerate, the equations (31) may
admit dierent solutions or no solution at all. something more is said in the following
theorem.1

theorem 1: let the legendre morphism chl : j 1y  zl be a submersion. then a section s
of j 1y  x is a solution of the cartan equations (23) if and only if chl  s is a solution of

the hamiltonde donder equations (30), i.e., cartan and hamiltonde donder equations
are quasi-equivalent.

iv. covariant hamiltonian dynamics

given a ber bundle y  x, let  be the legendre bundle (3). holonomic coordinates

(x, yi, p

i ) on  are compatible with its composite bration

x =   y :   y  x.

we have the canonical bundle monomorphism

 = p

i dyi     :  

y

n+1
 t y 
y

t x,

(32)

called the tangent-valued liouville form on . it should be emphasized that the exterior
dierential d can not be applied to the tangent-valued form (32). at the same time, there is
a unique t x-valued (n + 2)-form y on  such that the relation

y  = d()

holds for any exterior 1-form  on x.3 this form, called the polysymplectic form, is given
by the coordinate expression

y = dp

i  dyi    .

(33)

as was mentioned above, every section h of the ber bundle (5) denes the pull-back (6)

of the canonical form y (28), called a hamiltonian form on the legendre bundle .

proposition 2: hamiltonian forms on  constitute a non-empty ane space modelled over

the linear space of horizontal densities fh = fh on   x.

proof: this is an immediate consequence of the fact that (5) is an ane bundle modelled
over the pull-back vector bundle  
x

n
 t x  .

lemma 3:2,4 every connection  (15) on y  x yields the splitting

h : dyi 7 dyi  i

dx

9

of the exact sequence (4) and, as a consequence, denes the hamiltonian form

h = h

y = p

i dyi    p

i i

.

(34)

proposition 2 and lemma 3 lead to the following

corollary 4: given a connection  on y  x, every hamiltonian form h admits the
decomposition

h = h fh = p

i dyi    p

i i

  fh.

(35)

remark 2: the physical meaning of the splitting (35) is illustrated by the fact that, in the

case of x = r, fh is exactly the energy of a mechanical system with respect to the reference

frame .10,11

we will mean by a hamiltonian map any bundle morphism

 = dx  ( + i

i) :  
y

j 1y.

in particular, let  be a connection on y  x. then, the composition

b =   y = dx  ( + i

i) :   y  j 1y,

(36)

(37)

is a hamiltonian map. conversely, every hamiltonian map  yields the associated connection

 =  b0 on y  x, where b0 is the global zero section of the legendre bundle   y . in
particular, we have b = . the following two facts will be used in the sequel.
proposition 5:3 every hamiltonian form h (6) yields the hamiltonian map ch such that

(38)

h.

yi

 ch = i

proposition 6: every hamiltonian map (36) denes the hamiltonian form

h =  = p

i dyi    p

i i

.

proof: given an arbitrary connection  on the ber bundle y  x, the corresponding

hamiltonian map (37) denes the form b which is exactly the hamiltonian form h (34).
since  b is a v y -valued basic 1-form on   x, h  h is a horizontal density on .
then the result follows from proposition 2. note that h = hbh i h = h (34).

it is equipped with the adapted

 = dx  ( + i

)

(39)

on   x is called a hamiltonian connection if the exterior form y is closed. a
hamiltonian connection  is said to be associated with a hamiltonian form h if it obeys the
condition

y = dh,
i
 = i

h,


i = ih.

(40)

(41)

theorem 7: for every hamiltonian connection , there exists a local hamiltonian form h
on a neighbourhood of any point q   such that the equation (40) holds.

proof: if y is closed, there is a contractible neighbourhood u of a point q   which
belongs to a holonomic coordinate chart (x, yi, p
i ) and where the local form y is exact.
we have

y = dh = dp

i  dyi    (i

dp

i  

idyi)  

(42)

on u. it is readily observed that the second term in the right-hand side of this equality is
also an exact form on u. by virtue of the relative poincare lemma, it can be brought into
the form dh   where h is a local function on u. then the form h in the expression (42)
reads

h = p

i dyi    h.

using corollary 4, one can easily show that this is a hamiltonian form on u.

theorem 8: every hamiltonian form has an associated hamiltonian connection.

proof: given a hamiltonian form h, let us consider the rst order dierential operator

eh : j 1  t   (
eh = dh  y = [(yi

n
 t x),
  i

h)dp

i  (p

i + ih)dyi]  ,

(43)

on  where  is the canonical monomorphism (12).
it is called the hamilton operator
associated with h. a glance at the expression (43) shows that this operator is an ane
morphism over  of constant rank. it follows that its kernel is an ane closed imbedded
subbundle of the jet bundle j 1  . this subbundle has a global section  which is a
connection on   x. this connection obeys the equation (40).

11

it should be emphasized that, if n > 1, there is a set of hamiltonian connections associ-
ated with the same hamiltonian form h. they dier from each other in soldering forms 
on   x which obey the equation y = 0.

proposition 9: every hamiltonian connection  associated with a hamiltonian form h
satises the relation

j 1y   = ch.

(44)

proof: the proof is based on the expressions (38) and (41).

being a closed subbundle of the jet bundle j 1  x, the kernel of the hamilton operator
eh (43) denes rst order hamilton equations (7a)  (7b) on the legendre bundle . every
integral section j 1r =   r of a hamiltonian connection  associated with a hamiltonian
form h is obviously a solution of the hamilton equations (7a)  (7b). conversely, a solution
of the hamilton equations (7a)  (7b) is a section r of   x such that its jet prolongation
j 1r lives in ker eh. if r : x   is a global solution, there exists an extension of the local
section j 1r : r(x)  j 1 to a hamiltonian connection which has r as an integral section.
substituting j 1r in (44), we obtain the equality

j 1(y  r) = ch  r,

(45)

which is the coordinate-free form of the hamilton equations (7a). nevertheless, it may
happen that the hamilton equations have no solution through a given point q  .

remark 3: the hamilton equations can be introduced without appealing to the hamilton
operator. as was for the cartan equations (23), they are equivalent to the condition

r(udh) = 0

(46)

for any vertical vector eld u on   x.

v. lagrangian and hamiltonian degenerate systems

let us study the relations between hamilton and eulerlagrange equations when a
lagrangian is degenerate. their main peculiarity lies in the fact that there is a set of
hamiltonian forms associated with the same degenerate lagrangian.

remark 4: let us recall the coordinate expressions

(yi
(p

,byi

h),

(47)

(48)

in particular, if  is a hamiltonian connection for a hamiltonian form h, we obtain from

(45) and (47) that the composition j 1ch   takes its values into the sesquiholonomic jet
bundle bj 2y .

a hamiltonian form h is said to be associated with a lagrangian l if h satises the

relations

bl ch  bl = bl,
h = hbh +ch l.

(49a)

(49b)

a glance at the relation (49a) shows that bl ch is the projector
from  onto the lagrangian constraint space nl = bl(j 1y ). accordingly, ch  bl is the
projector from j 1y onto ch(nl).

lemma 10: any hamiltonian form h associated with a lagrangian l obeys the relation

i l(x, yi, j

p
i (q) = 

h(q)),

q  nl,

(50)

where hl is the poincarecartan form (17).

h |nl= ch hl |nl,

proof: the relation (49b) takes the coordinate form

h = p

i i

h  l(x, yi, j

h).

(51)

(52)

substituting (50) and (52) in (6), we obtain the relation (51).

something more can be said in the case of semiregular lagrangians. a lagrangian l is

of j 1y . the following fact will be used in the sequel.

lemma 11: the poincarecartan form hl for a semiregular lagrangian l is constant on

called semiregular if the pre-image bl1(q) of any point q  nl is a connected submanifold
the connected pre-image bl1(q) of any point q  nl.

proof: let u be a vertical vector eld on the ane jet bundle j 1y  y which takes its

an immediate consequence of this fact is the following assertion.

proposition 12: all hamiltonian forms associated with a semiregular lagrangian l coincide
with each other on the lagrangian constraint space nl, and the poincarecartan form hl
(17) for l is the pull-back

hl = blh,

i yi

(

  l) = h(x, yj, 

j ),

13

(53)

of any such a hamiltonian form h.

proof: given a vector v  tq, the value tch(v)hl(ch(q)) is the same for all hamiltonian
maps ch satisfying the relation (49a). then the results follow from the relation (51).

proposition 12 enables us to connect eulerlagrange and cartan equations for a semireg-

ular lagrangian l with the hamilton equations for hamiltonian forms associated with l.

theorem 13: let a section r of   x be a solution of the hamilton equations (7a) 
(7b) for a hamiltonian form h associated with a semiregular lagrangian l. if r lives in
the constraint space nl, the section s = y  r of y  x satises the eulerlagrange

proof: acting by the exterior dierential on the relation (53), we obtain the relation

(yi

which is equivalent to the system of equalities

equations (20), while s = ch  r obeys the cartan equations (26a)  (26b).
i    (il + i(h  bl))dyi   = 0
h  bl) = 0,
h  bl)  (il + (ih)  bl) = 0.
el = (j 1bl)eh,

using these equalities and the expression (48), one can easily see that

i

j (yj

lives in the lagrangian constraint space nl, and s = ch  r. then we have

(54)

(55)

where el is the eulerlagrangecartan operator (25). let r be a section of   x which

r = bl  s,

j 1r = j 1bl  j 1s.

if r is a solution of the hamilton equations, the exterior form eh vanishes on j 1r(x). hence,

the pull-back form el = (j 1bl)eh vanishes on j 1s(x). it follows that s obeys the cartan

equations (26a)  (26b). we obtain from the equality (45) that s = j 1s, s = y  r. hence,
s is a solution of the eulerlagrange equations.

the same result can be obtained from the relation

where l is the lagrangian (24) on j 1j 1y and lh is the lagrangian (8) on j 1.

l = (j 1bl)lh

(56)

theorem 14: given a semiregular lagrangian l, let a section s of the jet bundle j 1y  x
be a solution of the cartan equations (26a)  (26b). let h be a hamiltonian form associated
with l, and let h satisfy the relation

ch  bl  s = j 1(1

0  s).

(57)

equations (7a)  (7b) for h.

then, the section r = bl  s of the legendre bundle   x is a solution of the hamilton
proof: the hamilton equations (7a) hold by virtue of the condition (57). substituting bl  s

in the hamilton equations (7b) and using the relations (54) and (57), we come to the cartan
equations (26b) for s as follows:

i  s + (ih)  bl  s = bd

remark 5: since ch  bl in theorem (14) is a projection operator, the condition (57) implies

that the solution s of the cartan equations is actually an integrable section s = j 1s where s
is a solution of the eulerlagrange equations. theorems 13 and 14 show that, if a solution of
the cartan equations provides a solution of the covariant hamilton equations, it is necessarily
a solution of the eulerlagrange equations. in fact, the relation (55) gives more than it is
needed for proving theorem 13. using this relation, one can justify that, if  is a hamiltonian
connection for a hamiltonian form h associated with a semiregular lagrangian l, then the

fails to be true in the case of semiregular lagrangians. let a lagrangian l be hyperregular,

composition j 1ch    bl takes its values in ker el  dj 2y (see remark 4), i.e., this is a local
sesquiholonomic lagrangian connection on ch(nl).3 a converse of this assertion, however,
i.e., the legendre map bl is a dieomorphism. then bl1 is a hamiltonian map, and there is

a unique hamiltonian form

(58)

associated with l. in this case, both the relation (55) and the converse one

h = hbl1 + bl1l
eh = (j 1ch)el

hold. it follows that the eulerlagrange equations for l and the hamilton equations for h
(58) are equivalent.

we will say that a set of hamiltonian forms h associated with a semiregular lagrangian
l is complete if, for each solution s of the euler-lagrange equations, there exists a solution
r of the hamilton equations for a hamiltonian form h from this set such that s = y  r.
by virtue of theorem 14 and remark 5, a set of associated hamiltonian forms is complete
if, for every solution s on x of the euler-lagrange equations for l, there is a hamiltonian
form h from this set which fullls the relation

ch  bl  j 1s = j 1s.

15

(59)

as for the existence of complete sets of associated hamiltonian forms, we refer to the
following theorem. a lagrangian l is said to be almost regular if (i) l is semiregular, (ii)
the lagrangian constraint space nl is a closed imbedded subbundle in : nl   of the
legendre bundle   y and (iii) the legendre map

is a submersion, i.e., a bred manifold.

bl : j 1y  nl

(60)

proposition 15:2,23 let l be an almost regular lagrangian. on an open neighbourhood in 
of each point q  nl, there exist local hamiltonian forms associated with l which constitute
a complete set.

in the case of an almost regular lagrangian l, we can say something more on the relations
between lagrangian and hamiltonian systems as follows. let us assume that the bred
manifold (60) admits a global section . let us consider the pull-back

hn = hl,

(61)

called the constrained hamiltonian form. by virtue of lemma 11, it is uniquely dened for

all sections of the bred manifold j 1y  nl, and hl = blhn . for sections r of the ber

bundle nl  x, we can write the constrained hamilton equations

r(un dhn ) = 0

(62)

where un is an arbitrary vertical vector eld on nl  x. these equations possess the
following important properties.

theorem 16: for any hamiltonian form h associated with an almost regular lagrangian l,
every solution r of the hamilton equations which lives in the lagrangian constraint space
nl is a solution of the constrained hamilton equations (62).

proof: such a hamiltonian form h denes the global section  = ch  in of the bred

n h and the constrained hamilton equations

manifold (60). due to the relation (53), hn = i
can be written as

note that they dier from the hamilton equations (46) restricted to nl which read

r(un di

n h) = r(un dh |nl) = 0.

r(udh |nl) = 0,

(63)

(64)

where r is a section of nl  x and u is an arbitrary vertical vector eld on   x. a
solution r of the equations (64) satises obviously the weaker condition (63).

16

theorem 17: the constrained hamilton equations (62) are equivalent to the hamiltonde
donder equations (30).

proof: in accordance with the relation (27), the projection z (5) yields a surjection of zl
onto nl. given a section  of the bred manifold (60), we have the morphism

by virtue of lemma (11), this is a surjection such that

chl   : nl  zl.
z chl   = id nl.

hence, chl   is a bundle isomorphism over y which is independent of the choice of a global

section . combining (29) and (61) gives

that leads to the desired equivalence.

hn = (chl  )l

the above proof gives more. namely, since zl and nl are isomorphic, the legendre
morphism hl fullls the conditions of theorem 1. then combining theorem 1 and theorem
17, we obtain the following theorem.

theorem 18: let l be an almost regular lagrangian such that the bred manifold (60) has a
global section. a section s of the jet bundle j 1y  x is a solution of the cartan equations

(23) i bl  s is a solution of the constrained hamilton equations (62).

theorem 18 is also a corollary of the following lemma 19. the constrained hamiltonian

form hn (61) denes the constrained lagrangian

ln = h0(hn ) = (j 1in )lh

on the jet manifold j 1nl of the ber bundle nl  x.

lemma 19: there are the relations

where l is the lagrangian (24).

l = (j 1bl)ln ,

ln = (j 1)l,

(65)

(66)

proof: the rst of the relations (66) is an immediate consequence of the relation (56). the

latter follows from the expression (47) and the relation (50) if we put  = ch  in for some

hamiltonian form h associated with the almost regular lagrangian l.

the eulerlagrange equation for the constrained lagrangian ln (65) are equivalent to
the constrained hamilton equations and, by virtue of lemma 19, are quasi-equivalent to the

17

cartan equations. at the same time, cartan equations of degenerate lagrangian systems
contain an additional freedom in comparison with the restricted hamilton equations (see the
next section).

the correspondence between lagrangian and covariant hamiltonian dynamics of classical
elds can be extended to symmetry currents and conservation laws as follows.3,21 given a
projectable vector eld u on a ber bundle y  x and its lift

onto the legendre bundle , we obtain

eu = u + uii + (iujp

j  up

i + up

i )i



i.e., the hamiltonian form h (6) and the lagrangian lh (8) have the same symmetries. if
the lie derivatives (68) vanish, the corresponding symmetry current

is conserved on-shell. in particular, if u is a vertical vector eld, we have

leuh = lj 1eulh,

h

=i

ju = h0(euh) |yi
ju = euh = uh.

(67)

(68)

(69)

(70)

proposition 20: let a hamiltonian form h be associated with a semiregular lagrangian l.
let r be a solution of the hamilton equations for h which lives in the lagrangian constraint
space nl. let s = y  r be the corresponding solution of the eulerlagrange equations
for l so that the relation (59) holds. then, for any projectable vector eld u on the ber
bundle y  x, we have

where t is the current (22) on j 1y and j is the current (69) on .

ju(r) = tu(ch  r),

ju(bl  j 1s) = tu(s),

it follows that the constrained hamilton equations have symmetries of the eulerlagrange
equations. at the same time, given a hamiltonian form h associated with a degenerate la-
grangian l, the lagrangian lh (8) contains gauge xing terms in comparison with l and
the lagrangian ln (65) (see the next section).

vi. quadratic degenerate systems

this section is devoted to the physically important case of almost regular quadratic
lagrangians. given a ber bundle y  x, let us consider a quadratic lagrangian l which
has the coordinate expression

l =

a
ij yi

the ane transformation law of the coordinates yi

lemma 21: the lagrangian (71) is semiregular.

proof: solutions yi
modelled over the linear space of solutions of the linear algebraic equations a
each point of nl, these spaces are obviously connected.

 of the pointwise linear algebraic equations (72) form an ane space
 = 0. at

ij yj

let the lagrangian l (71) be almost regular, i.e., the matrix function a
ij

is of constant
rank. then the lagrangian constraint space nl (72) is an ane subbundle of the legendre
bundle   y , modelled over the vector subbundle n l (73) of   y . hence, nl  y
has a global section. for the sake of simplicity, let us assume that it is the canonical zero

section b0(y ) of   y . then n l = nl. accordingly, the kernel of the legendre map (72)

is an ane subbundle of the ane jet bundle j 1y  y , modelled over the kernel of the
linear morphism l (73). then there exists a connection

 : y  kerbl  j 1y,

(76)

and, as a consequence, the conditions i

after pointwise diagonalization, the matrix a has some non-vanishing components aaa, a

aa = (aaa)1,

aa = 0, a 6= a, a, a  i,

while the remaining components bc, b 6 i, are arbitrary. in particular, there is a solution

bc = 0,

(79)

(80)

further on, we will take  to be the solution (79). if the lagrangian (71) is regular, the
linear map (77) is uniquely determined by the equations (78).

the following theorem is the key point of our consideration.

(82a)

(82b)

proof: the proof follows from a direct computation by means of the relations (75), (78) and
(80).

it is readily observed that, with respect to the coordinates s i

 and f i

 (81b), the lagran-

gian (71) reads

l =

f j

 + c.

(83)

note that, in gauge theory, we have the canonical splitting (81a) where 2f is the strength
tensor.3,8,9 the yangmills lagrangian of gauge theory is exactly of the form (83) where
c = 0. the lagrangian of proca elds is also of the form (83) where c is the mass term.
this is an example of a degenerate lagrangian system without gauge symmetries.

given the linear map  (77) and a connection  (74), let us consider the ane hamilto-

nian map

theorem 24: the hamiltonian forms (85) spanned by connections  (74) are associated with
the lagrangian (71) and constitute a complete set.

proof: by the very denitions of  and , the hamiltonian map (84) satises the condition

(49a). a direct computation shows that  = ch. then the relation (49b) also holds and,

if  is a connection (74), the hamiltonian form h (85) is associated with the lagrangian
(71). let us write the corresponding hamilton equations (7a) for a section r of the legendre
bundle   x. they are

due to the surjections s and f (81a), the hamilton equations (86) break in two parts

(86)

(87)

(88)

s = y  r.

j 1s = (b + )  r,

s  j 1s =   s,

f  j 1s =   r,

let s be an arbitrary section of y  x, e.g., a solution of the eulerlagrange equations.
there exists a connection  (74) such that the relation (87) holds, namely,  = s   where
 is a connection on y  x which has s as an integral section. it is easily seen that, in
this case, the hamiltonian map (84) satises the relation (59) for s. hence, the hamiltonian
forms (85) constitute a complete set.

of course, this complete set is neither minimal nor unique. hamiltonian forms h (85)
of this set dier from each other in the term i
i where  are the soldering forms (76). if
follows from the splitting (82a) that this term vanishes on the lagrangian constraint space.
the corresponding constrained hamiltonian form hn = i
n h and the constrained hamilton
equations (62) can be written. in the case of quadratic lagrangians, we can improve theorem
16 as follows.

r

theorem 25: for every hamiltonian form h (85), the hamilton equations (7b) and (88)
restricted to the lagrangian constraint space nl are equivalent to the constrained hamilton
equations.

21

proof: due to the splitting (82a), we have the corresponding splitting of the vertical tangent
bundle vy  of the legendre bundle   y . in particular, any vertical vector eld u on
  x admits the decomposition

u = [u  ut n ] + ut n ,
ut n = uii + a
u
ij jk

k i
,

such that un = ut n |nl is a vertical vector eld on the lagrangian constraint space nl  x.
let us consider the equations

r(ut n dh) = 0

(89)

where r is a section of   x and u is an arbitrary vertical vector eld on   x. they
are equivalent to the pair of equations

i

dh) = 0,

ij jk

r(a
r(idh) = 0.

(90a)

(90b)

the equations (90b) are obviously the hamilton equations (7b) for h. bearing in mind
the relations (75) and (80), one can easily show that the equations (90a) coincide with
the hamilton equations (88). the proof is completed by observing that, restricted to the
lagrangian constraint space nl, the equations (89) are exactly the constrained hamilton
equations (63).

note that, in hamiltonian gauge theory, the restricted hamiltonian form and the re-

stricted hamilton equations are gauge invariant.

theorem 25 shows that, restricted to the lagrangian constraint space, the hamilton
equations for dierent hamiltonian forms (85) associated with the same quadratic lagran-
gian (71) dier from each other in the equations (87). these equations are independent of
momenta and play the role of gauge-type conditions as follows.

by virtue of theorem 18, the constrained hamilton equation are quasi-equivalent to
the cartan equations. a section s of j 1y  x is a solution of the cartan equations for an

almost regular quadratic lagrangian (71) i r = bl  s is a solution of the hamilton equations

(7b) and (88). in particular, let s be such a solution of the cartan equations and s0 a section
of the ber bundle t x 
v y  x which takes its values into ker l (see (73)) and projects
y
onto the section s = 1
0  s of y  x. then the ane sum s + s0 over s(x)  y is also a
solution of the cartan equations. thus, we come to the notion of a gauge-type freedom of
the cartan equations for an almost regular quadratic lagrangian l. one can speak of the
gauge classes of solutions of the cartan equations whose elements dier from each other in
the above-mentioned sections s0. let z be such a gauge class whose elements project onto a
section s of y  x. for dierent connections  (74), we consider the condition

s  s =   s,

s  z.

(91)

22

proposition 26: (i) if two elements s and s of the same gauge class z obey the same condition
(91), then s = s. (ii) for any solution s of the cartan equations, there exists a connection
(74) which fullls the condition (91).

proof: (i) let us consider the ane dierence s  s over s(x)  y . we have s(s  s) = 0
i s = s. (ii) in the proof of theorem 24, we have shown that, given s = 0
1  s, there exists
a connection  (74) which fullls the relation (87). let us consider the ane dierence
s(s  j 1s) over s(x)  y . this is a local section of the vector bundle ker l  y over
s(x). let  be its prolongation onto y . it is easy to see that  +  is the desired connection.

due to the properties in proposition 26, one can treat (91) as a gauge-type condition
on solutions of the cartan equations. the hamilton equations (87) exemplify this gauge-
type condition when s = j 1s is a solution of the eulerlagrange equations. at the same
time, the above-mentioned freedom characterizes solutions of the cartan equations, but not
the eulerlagrange ones. first of all, this freedom reects the degeneracy of the cartan
equations (26a). therefore, in the hamiltonian gauge theory, the above freedom is not
related directly to the familiar gauge invariance. nevertheless, the hamilton equations (87)
are not gauge invariant, and also can play the role of gauge conditions in gauge theory.
indeed, given a hamiltonian form h (85), the corresponding lagrangian lh (8) reads

lh = r

i (s i

  i

) + p 

i f 

i 

1
2

ij
p 

i p 

j + c.

(92)

in comparison with the lagrangian l (71) and the constrained lagrangian lh |j 1nl, the
lagrangian (92) includes the additional gauge xing term r

i (s i

  i

).

vii. vertical extension of polysymplectic formalism

the extension of polysymplectic formalism to the vertical tangent bundle v y of y  x
is a preliminary step toward its brst extension. the legendre bundle (3) over v y  x,
called the vertical legendre bundle, is

v y = v v y 
v y

(

we will use the compact notation

i =

v = yii + p

lemma 27: there exists the bundle isomorphism

v y

(93)

23

written relative to the holonomic coordinates (x, yi, yi, p
on v .

i , q

i ) on v y and (x, yi, p

i , yi, p
i )

proof: similar to the well-known isomorphism between the ber bundles t t x and t t x,5
the isomorphism

v v y =

v y

v v y,

pi  vi,

pi  yi,

can be established by inspection of the transformation laws of the holonomic coordinates
(x, yi, pi) on v y and (x, yi, vi) on v y .

it follows that hamiltonian formalism on the vertical legendre bundle v y can be devel-
oped as the vertical extension onto v  of hamiltonian formalism on , where the canonical
conjugate pairs are (yi, p
i ). in particular, due to the isomorphism (93), v  is
endowed with the canonical polysymplectic form (33) which reads

i ) and ( yi, p

v y = [d p

i  dyi + dp

i  d yi]    .

(94)

let zv y be the homogeneous legendre bundle (2) over v y with the corresponding coor-
i , p). it can be endowed with the canonical form v y (28). sections

i , q

dinates (x, yi, yi, p
of the ane bundle

zv y  v ,

(95)

by denition, provide hamiltonian forms on v . let us consider the following particular
case of these forms which are related to those on the legendre bundle . due to the ber
bundle

 : v zy  zv y ,
i , q
(x, yi, yi, p

i , p)   = (x, yi, yi, p

i , p

i , p),

(96)

the vertical tangent bundle v zy of zy  x is provided with the exterior form

v =  v y = p + ( p

i dyi + p

i d yi)  .

given the ane bundle zy   (5), we have the ber bundle

v z : v zy  v ,

(97)

where v z is the vertical tangent map to z. the ber bundles (95), (96) and (97) form
the commutative diagram.

let h be a section of the ane bundle zy   and h = h the corresponding hamil-
tonian form (6) on . then the section v h of the ber bundle (97) and the corresponding
section   v h of the ane bundle (95) denes the hamiltonian form

hv = (v h)v = ( p

on v . it is called the vertical extension of h. in particular, given the splitting (35) of h
with respect to a connection  on y  x, we have the corresponding splitting

hv = p

i i

 + yjp

i ji

 + v fh

of hv with respect to the vertical connection v  (16) on v y  x.

proposition 28: let  (39) be a hamiltonian connection on  associated with a hamiltonian
form h. then its vertical prolongation v  (16) on v   x is a hamiltonian connection
associated with the vertical hamiltonian form hv (98).

proof: the proof follows from a direct computation. we have

v  =  + dx  [v i


i + v 

i

i
].

components of this connection obey the hamilton equations (41) and the equations

i
 = i

hv = v i

h,


i = ihv = v ih.

(99)

in order to clarify the physical meaning of the hamilton equations (99), let us suppose
that y  x is a vector bundle. given a solution r of the hamilton equations for h, let
r be a jacobi eld, i.e., r + r is also a solution of the same hamilton equations modulo
terms of order > 1 in . then it is readily observed that the jacobi eld r satises the
hamilton equations (99). at the same time, the lagrangian lhv (8) on j 1v , dened by
the hamiltonian form hv (98), takes the form

lv h = h0(hv ) = p

i (yi

viii. brst-extended hamiltonian formalisl

the brst extension of hamiltonian mechanics11,12 shows that: (i) one should consider
vector bundles y  x in order to introduce generators of brst and anti-brst transfor-
mations, and (ii) one can narrow the class of superfunctions under consideration because the
brst extension of a hamiltonian is a polynomial of a nite degree in odd variables. there-
fore, we will formulate the brst extension on the polysymplectic hamiltonian formalism
in the terms of simple graded manifolds.

recall24,25 that by a graded manifold is meant the pair (z, a) of a smooth manifold z

and a sheaf a of graded-commutative r-algebras such that

25

(i) there is the exact sequence of sheaves

0  j  a  c (z)  0,

j = a1 + (a1)2,

(101)

(ii) j /j 2 is a locally free c (z)-module of nite rank, and a is locally isomorphic to
(j /j 2). the exact sequence (101) admits the canonical splitting

the exterior bundle 

c(z)

c (z)  a, and the well-known batchelors theorem takes place.

theorem 29:25,26 let (z, a) be a graded manifold. there exists a vector bundle e  z with
an m-dimensional typical ber v such that a is isomorphic to the sheaf ae of sections of
the exterior bundle

 e = r 
(
z

k
 e)

m

k=1

(102)

whose typical ber is the nite grassman algebra v .

this isomorphism fails to be canonical, and restricts transformations of a graded manifold
to those induced by the bundle automorphisms of e  z. nevertheless, this class of
transformations is sucient for our purposes because we consider the graded extension of
hamiltonian formalism on smooth manifolds when the vector bundle e (115) below is xed.
we will call (z, ae) the simple graded manifold. this is not the terminology of ref.
[27]
where this term is applied to all nite graded manifolds, but in connection with batchelors
isomorphism.

global sections of the exterior bundle (102) are called superfunctions due to the equiv-
alence between the graded manifolds (z, a) and the de witt supermanifolds whose body
is z.25,28 this isomorphism is important for for functional integration over superfunctions.
superfunctions make up a z2-graded ring ae(x). let {ca} be the holonomic bases for
e  z with respect to some bundle atlas with transition functions {a
b (z)cb.
then superfunctions read

b }, i.e., ca = a

f =

mxk=0

1
k!

fa1...akca1    cak ,

(103)

where fa1ak are local functions on z, and we omit the symbol of exterior product of elements
c. the coordinate transformation law of superfunctions (103) is obvious. we will use the
notation [.] of the grassman parity.

given a graded manifold (z, a), the sheaf dera of graded derivations of a is introduced.
this is a subsheaf of endomorphisms of a whose sections u on an open subset u  z are
graded derivations of the restriction a |u of the sheaf a to u, i.e.,

u(f f ) = u(f )f  + (1)[u][f ]f u(f )

for the homogeneous elements u  (dera)(u) and f, f   a |u .
in the case of graded
manifolds, derivations of a are local operators. it means that (dera)(u) = dera(u), i.e., if

26

u   u are open sets, there is the restriction morphism dera(u)  dera(u).25 it follows
that the sheaf dera coincides with the sheaf of graded a modules u  dera(u).
its
sections are called supervector elds on a manifold z. the dual of the sheaf dera is the
sheaf dera generated by the a-linear morphisms

 : dera(u)  au.

(104)

one can think of its sections as being 1-superforms on a manifold z.

in the case of a simple graded manifold (z, ae) supervector elds and 1-superforms
can be represented by sections of vector bundles as follows. due to the canonical splitting
v e = e  e, the vertical tangent bundle v e  e can be provided with the ber bases
{a} dual of {ca}. these are ber bases for pr2v e = e. let (za) be coordinates on z.
then a supervector eld on a trivialization domain u read u = uaa + uaa where ua, ua
are local superfunctions. it yields a graded endomorphism of ae(u) by the rule

u(fa...bca    cb) = uaa(fa...b)ca    cb + uafa...ba(ca    cb).

(105)

this implies the corresponding coordinate transformation law

ua = ua,

ua = a

j uj + uaa(a

j )cj

it follows that supervector elds on z, which we agree to call e-
of supervector elds.
determined supervector elds, can be represented by sections of the vector bundle ve  z
which is locally isomorphic to the vector bundle

and has the transition functions

(106)

due to the above mentioned locality property the sheaf of sections of the vector bundle
ve  z is isomorphic to the sheaf der ae. global sections of ve  z constitute the
ae(z)-module of supervector elds on z, which is also a lie superalgebra with respect to
the bracket

[u, u] = uu + (1)[u][u]+1uu.

27

one can think of a splitting

of the exact sequence (106) as being a graded connection, though this is not a true connection
on ve  z. a graded connection can be represented by a section

e : zaa 7 za(a +ea

(107)

of the vector bundle t z

e = dza  (a +ea

is the canonical form dza  a on z. such a graded connection e transforms every vector

eld  on z into a supervector eld

and provides the corresponding decomposition

 =  aa 7 e =  a(a +ea

aa),

of supervector elds on z. for instance, every linear connection

u = uaa + uaa = ua(a +ea

aa) + (ua  uaea

a)a

on the vector bundle e  z denes the graded connection

 = dza  (a + a

a

bvba)

s = dza  (a + a

a

bcba)

(109)

such that, for any vector eld  on z and any superfunction f , the graded derivation s (f )
is exactly the covariant derivative  aaf relative to the connection .

remark 6: let now z  x be a ber bundle, coordinated by (x, zi). let

 =  + 

a

bvbdx  a

be a connection on e  x which is a linear morphism over a connection  on z  x.
then we have the bundle monomorphism

(111)

the sheaf of sections of v

then the morphism (104) can be seen as the interior product

u = uaa + (1)[a]uaa.

(112)

any graded connection e (108) also yields the splitting of the exact sequence (111), and

denes the corresponding decomposition of 1-superforms

accordingly, k-superforms  are sections of the graded exterior bundle k

e such that

the interior product (112) is extended to higher degree superforms by the rule

 = (1)||||+[][].

u() = (u) + (1)||+[][u](u).

29

recall that the graded exterior dierential d of superfunctions is introduced in accordance
with the condition udf = u(f ) for an arbitrary supervector eld u, and is extended uniquely
to higher degree superforms by the rules

d() = (d) + (1)||(d),

d  d = 0.

it takes the coordinate form

d = dzaa() + dcaa(),

where the left derivatives a, a act on the coecients of superforms by the rule (105), and
they are graded commutative with the forms dza, dca. the lie derivative of a superform 
along a supervector eld u is given by the familiar formula

lu = ud + d(u).

(113)

remark 7: given a vector bundle e  z, let us consider the jet manifold j 1e, coordinated
by (za, va, va
a). this is also a vector bundle over z. then one can construct the correspond-
j 1e. due to the monomorphism e  (j 1e), there is the
ing ber bundles vj 1e and v 
monomorphism v 
j 1e, i.e., every e-determined superform on z can be also seen as a
j 1e-determined superform. in particular, the horizontal projection h0 (14) gives rise to the
0-graded homomorphism

e  v 

h0 : dca  ca

adza

(114)

which sends e-determined superforms onto horizontal j 1e-determined superforms.

turn now to the brst extension of covariant hamiltonian formalism on the legendre
bundle  (3) when y  x is a vector bundle. let us apply the above construction of simple
graded manifolds to the case of the vertical tangent bundle

e = v v  = v  
x

v 

pr1 v 

(115)

over the vertical legendre bundle z = v   x. let (x, yi, p
i ) be the holonomic
coordinates on v . then the dual e of e can be endowed with the associated ber bases
{ci, c
i } such that ci and ci have the same linear coordinate transformation law as
the coordinates yi and yi, while c
i . the
corresponding supervector elds and superforms are introduced on v  as sections of the
vector bundles vv v  and v 
vv v 
and c 
x

v v , respectively. let us complexify these bundles as c 
x

i and c

i have those of the coordinates p

i and p

i , yi, p

i , ci, c

v 

v v .

30

as in mechanics, the main criterion of the brst extension of covariant hamiltonian
formalism is its invariance under brst and anti-brst transformations whose generators
are the supervector elds

q = c + i yi 

c = cii + c

on v . they fulll the nilpotency rules

qq = 0,

qq = 0,

qq + qq = 0.

the brst- and anti-brst-invariant extension of the polysymplectic form v y (94) on

v  is the t x-valued superform

s = [d p

i  dyi + dp

i  d yi + i(dc

i  dci  dci  dc

i )]    

i ) and (ci, ic

on v , where (ci, ic
i ) are the conjugate pairs. let  be a hamiltonian
connection for a hamiltonian form h. the double vertical connection v v  on v v   x
is a linear morphism over the vertical connection v  on v   x, and so denes the
composite graded connection

(v v )s = v  + dx  [gi



ci + g

i


c
i

+ gi



ci + g

]

(110) on v   x, whose components g and g are given by the expressions

gi
 = ci

h,

g
i = cih,

gi
 = ci

h,

g
i = cih.

this composite graded connection satises the relation

and so is a hamiltonian graded connection for the hamiltonian superform

(v v )ss = dhs,

hs = [ p

i dyi + p

i d yi + i(c

i dci + dcic

i )]  (v + icc)h

(117)

on v . this superform is brst- and anti-brst-invariant, i.e., lhs = 0. thus, it is the
desired brst extension of the hamiltonian form h.

the hamiltonian superform hs (117) denes the corresponding brst-extension of the

lagrangian lh (8). following remark 7, let us consider the vector bundle

j 1(v v ) = v j 1(v )  j 1(v ) = v j 1

31

and the corresponding ber bundle vv j 1(v )  v j 1. it is readily observed that v v -
determined superforms on v  can be seen as particular v j 1(v )-determined superforms on
v j 1. moreover, combining the horizontal projections h0 (14) and (114) for exterior forms
and superforms, we obtain the 0-graded homomorphism h0 which sends v v -determined
superforms on v  onto the horizontal v j 1(v )-determined superforms on v j 1  x.
then the horizontal superdensity

lsh = h0(hs) = lv h + i[(c

i ci

i[c

  ci

c
h)c

i )  cch] = lv h +
i + c

i c

j

h  cicjijh]

j i

(118)

on v j 1  x can be treated as the desired brst extension of the lagrangian lh (8). note
that, in comparison with the lagrangian lv h (100), the generating functional determined
by the brst-extended lagrangian (118) is not reduced to -functions.

the brst-extended lagrangian lsh (118) is also invariant under the jet prolongations

j 1 = aa + da
a

of the brst and anti-brst transformations (116). moreover, it is easily veried that both
lhs and hs are invariant under transformations whose generators are the supervector elds

(119)

the supervector elds (116) and (119) constitute the lie superalgebra of the well-known
group isp(2):

[q, q] = [q, q] = [q, q] = [k, q] = [k, q] = 0,

(120)

[k, q] = q,

[k, q] = q,

[k, k] = c,

[c, k] = 2k,

[c, k] = 2k.

similarly to the lift eu (67) onto  of a vector eld u on y , the supervector elds  (116)

and (119) can be represented as the corresponding graded lift

 = eu = uaa  (1)[ya]([pb]+[ub])aub 

pa

of some v v y -determined supervector elds u on v y which are sections of the ber bundle
vv v y v y . these supervector elds u read

uq = cii + i yi

uk = c

uk = c

uq = cii  i yi

they also constitute the lie superalgebra (120). then by analogy with (70), we obtain the
corresponding supercurrents j = hs = uhs. these are the horizontal (n1)-superforms

q = (ci p
k = ic

i  yic
i ci, k = ic

i ), q = (ci p

i  yic

i ),

i ci, c = i(cci  cici)

on v . they form the lie superalgebra (120) with respect to the product (11). it should
be emphasized that the lie superalgebra (120) provides the canonical symmetries of any
brst-extended hamiltonian system.

the following construction is similar to that is met in supersymmetric mechanics and
brst mechanics. given a function f on the legendre bundle , let us consider the operators

f = ef    ef =   cf, f  = ef    ef =  + cf,

 > 0,

(122)

called the brst and anti-brst charges, which act on superfunctions on v . these oper-
ators are nilpotent, i.e.,

by the brst- and anti-brst-invariant extension of f is meant the superfunction

f  f = 0,

f   f  = 0.

fs = 

i


(f   f + f  f ).

we have the relations

(123)

(124)

f  fs  fs  f = 0,

f   fs  fs  f  = 0.

these relations together with the relations (123) provide the operators f, f , and fs with
the structure of the lie superalgebra sl(1/1).29

let now i

 = 

i

jyj be a linear connection on y  x and e some hamiltonian con-

nection on   x for the hamiltonian form h (34). given the splitting (35) of the
hamiltonian form h with respect to the connection , there is the corresponding splitting
of the brst-extended hamiltonian form

i

i ) + (v + icc)fh
with respect to the composite graded connection (v ve)s (110) on the ber bundle v   x.
let dv be a volume element on x and fh = f dv , where f is a function on . then

jcj + cj

j + i(c

i

i 

fhs = fsdv = i(f 1  f1 + f1  f 1)dv,

where f1, f 1 and fs are the brst and anti-brst charges (122) and (124). the similar
splitting of a super-hamiltonian is the corner stone of supersymmetric mechanics.30,31
