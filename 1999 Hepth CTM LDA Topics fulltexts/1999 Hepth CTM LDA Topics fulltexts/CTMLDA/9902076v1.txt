abstract

spherically and cylindrically symmetric solutions of su (3) yang - mills the-

ory are found, whose gauge potentials have conning properties. the spheri-

cally symmetric solutions give eld distributions which have a spherical sur-

face on which the gauge elds become innite (which is similiar to bag mod-

els of connement), and the other solution has a potential which increases

at large distances. the cylindrically symmetric solution describes a classi-

cal eld string (ux tube) of the kind which is expected to form between

quarks in the dual superconductor picture of connement. these solutions

with classical conning behaviour appear to be typical solutions for the clas-

sical su (3) yang - mills equations. this implies that the conning properties

of the classical su (3) yang - mills theory are general properties of this theory.

i. introduction

the strong, nuclear interaction (quantum chromodynamics or qcd) is thought to be

described by a quantized su(3) gauge theory. in this paper we will examine solutions to the

classical eld equations of an su(3) gauge theory. the reason for investigating these classical

eld congurations is to see if they might shed some light on the connement mechanism

which is hypothesized to occur in the strong interaction. although a full explanation of

the connement mechanism may require that one consider the fully quantized theory, the

solutions presented in this paper have properties which mimick the behaviour of various

phenomenological explanations of connement. in particular the various solutions exhibit a

bag-like structure similiar to the bag models [1] of connement, an almost linearly increasing

potential such as those used in the study of heavy quark bound states [2], and a string like

structure as found in the dual superconducting picture of connement.

the draw back of the classical congurations presented here is that they all have innite

eld energy when their energy densities are intergrated over. this can be compared with the

nite energy monopole and dyon solutions of yang-mills eld theory [3] [4]. at the classical

level one might expect that only solutions which have elds that become innite (and thus

have an innite eld energy) are capable of giving a conning behaviour. in the context

of su(2) yang-mills theory it has been shown [5] that, at the classical level, nite energy

solutions, like monopoles, do not lead to connement, while innite energy solutions do lead

to connment. quantum eects may modify these classical solutions to soften the innite

eld strengths and energies in the same way that quantum eects soften the singularity of

the coulomb solution in e&m.

ii. spherically symmetric ansatz

the ansatz for the su(3) gauge eld we take as in [6] [7]:

a0 =

2(r)

ir2 (cid:16)2x  5y + 7z(cid:17) +

1
2

2

ij + a

a(cid:16)a

ji(cid:17) xixj

r2 w(r),

(1)

aa

i = (cid:16)a

ij  a

ji(cid:17) xj
ir2 (f (r)  1) + a

jk(cid:16)iljxk + ilkxj(cid:17) xl

r3 v(r),

(2)

here a are the gell - mann matrices; a = 1, 2, . . . , 8 is a color index; the latin indices

i, j, k, l = 1, 2, 3 are the space indices; i2 = 1; r, ,  are the usual spherically coordinates.
substituting eqs. (1) - (2) into the yang - mills equations

1

g

(cid:16)gf a

(cid:17) + f abcf b

ac

 = 0,

gives the following system of equations for f (r), v(r), w(r) and (r)

r2f  = f 3  f + 7f v2 + 2vw  f (cid:16)w2 + 2(cid:17) ,
r2v = v3  v + 7vf 2 + 2f w  v(cid:16)w2 + 2(cid:17) ,
r2w = 6w(cid:16)f 2 + v2(cid:17)  12f v,
r2 = 2(cid:16)f 2 + v2(cid:17)  4f vw.

(3)

(4)

(5)

(6)

(7)

this set of equations is dicult to solve even numerically thus we will investigate various

simplied cases when only two of the functions are nonzero. under this assumption there

are three cases. in the rst case (f, w = 0) or (v, w = 0) eqs. (4) - (7) reduce to a form

similiar to the system of equations studied in [8] which yield the well known dyon solutions.

we will examine the cases where w =  = 0, and f =  = 0 (or v =  = 0).

a. the su (3) bag

in this case we set w =  = 0 so that eqs. (4) - (7) reduce to the following form

r2f  = f 3  f + 7f v2,
r2v = v3  v + 7vf 2.

(8)

(9)

to simplify the equations further we take f (r) = v(r) = q(r)/8. this reduces eqs. (8) -

(9) to

r2q = q(q2  1)

3

(10)

this is the wu-yang equation. in addition to the monopole solutions to this equation [9]

[10] it is also known that this equation possesses a solution which becomes innite on a

spherical surface [5] [11] [12] [13] [14]. if one lets this spherical surface be at r = r0 then in

the limit r  r0 the form of the solution approaches

q(r) 

2r0
r0  r

(11)

using eq. (11) to nd f (r), v(r) and inserting these back into eq. (2) shows that the aa
i

gauge eld develops a singularity on the sphere of radius r = r0. it is easy to solve eq.

(10) numerically (for this work we used the mathematica [15] numerical dierential solver

routinue). in solving eq. (10) we considered that near r = 0 the function q(r) had a series

expansion like

q(r) = 1 + q2

r2
2!

+ ...

(12)

where q2 is some constant. chosing a specic q2 at some radius r = ri sets the initial

conditions on q(ri), q(ri) for the numerical solution. the choice of these initial conditions

determined the radius on which q(r) became singular. in fig. 1 we show a typical example

of q(r). this type of eld conguration is somewhat similiar to a bag-like structure, and it

has been shown that such structures lead to the connement of a test particle placed in the

eld of this solution [5] [14] [16] [17]. if complex gauge elds are allowed [18] or if scalar

elds are introduced into the eld equations [19] it is possible to nd analytical solutions

which possesses gauge elds which are singular on some spherical surface of radius r = r0.

several authors have remarked on the mathematical similiarity between the above solution

and the schwarzschild solution of general relativity, which leads to a gravitational type of

connement.

b. the su (3) bunker

here we examine the f =  = 0 case. the case v =  = 0 is entirely analogous. from

eqs. (4) - (7) the equations for the ansatz functions become

4

r2v = v3  v  vw2,
r2w = 6wv2.

near r = 0 we took the series expansion form for v and w as

v = 1 + v2

+ ...,

r2
2!
r3
3!

w = w3

+ ...

(13)

(14)

(15)

(16)

where v2, w3 were constants which determined the initial conditions on v and w as in the

last section. in the asymptotic limit r   the form of the solutions to eqs. (13) - (14)
approaches the form

v  a sin (x + 0) ,
w  "x +
  1
3a2 = (  1).

4

cos (2x + 20)

x

# ,

(17)

(18)

(19)

where x = r/r0 is a dimensionless radius and r0, 0, and a are constants. the second,

strongly oscillating term in w(r) is kept since it contributes to the asymptotic behaviour of

w. as in the previous case we did not nd an analytical solution for eqs. (13) - (14) but it

is straight forward to solve these equations numerically. a typical solution is shown in fig.

2. the strongly oscillating behaviour of v(r) resulted in the space part of the gauge eld of

eq. (2) being strongly oscillating. the ansatz function w(r) increases as some power of x

as x  , and would lead to the connement of a test particle placed in the background
eld of this solution. (for the bunker solution there is some subtlety associated with the

connement of the test particle due to pair creation when the test particle scatters o the

potential. this is essentially related to the klein paradox and is discussed in refs. [20] [21]).

the type of connement given by this bunker solution is dierent from the bag-like solution

of the previous sub-section : first the conning behaviour of the bag-like solution came from

the magnetic part of the gauge eld (aa

i ) through the ansatz functions v(r), f (r), while

in the present case it is the electric part of the gauge eld (aa

0) which gives connement

5

through the ansatz function w(r). second, the bag-like solution connes a test particle

by the eld strength becoming innitely large at some nite value of r, while the present

solution connes a test particle by the eld strength increasing without bound as r  .
the power law with which w(r) increases changes as r increases. in fig. 3 we show a plot

of log(w)  log(x) for the solution of fig. 2. at around log(x)  0.7 the slope of the line
(and therefore the power law increase of w(r)) changes from   2.8 to   1.3. depending
on the initial conditions we found that for x near the origin  was in the range  2  3
while as x became large  decreased to the range of  1.2  1.8. in studies of heavy quark
bound states [2] a potential which increases as r   is often used to sucessfully model the
excited states of these systems. in these studies the increase is usually linear in r.

the magnetic and electric elds associated with this solution can be found from aa

and have the following behaviour

here for ea

r , h a

 , and h a

 the color index a = 1, 3, 4, 6, 8 and for h a

r , ea

 and ea

 a = 2, 5, 7.

the asymptotic behaviour of h a

, h a

 and ea

, ea

 is dominated by the strongly oscillating

function v(r). if quantum corrections where applied to this solution it is expected that these

strongly oscillating elds would be smoothed out and not play a signicant role in the large

r limit. from eqs. (20) - (21) and the asymptotic form of v(r), w(r) the radial components

of the magnetic and electric have the following asymptotic behaviour

h a
r 

1
r2 ,

ea
r

r2 .

(22)

where the strongly oscillating portion of h a

r is assumed not to contribute in the limit of large

r due to smoothing by quantum corrections. the radial electric eld falls o slower than

1/r2 (since  > 1) indicating the presence of a conning potential. the 1/r2 fall o of h a
r

indicates that this solution carries a magnetic charge. this was also true for the simple

solutions discussed in refs. [6] [10]. it can also be shown in the same way that the bag-like

6

solution of the previous section also carries a magnetic charge. this leads to the result

that if a test particle is placed in the background eld of either the bag or bunker solution,

this composite system will have unusal spin properties [22] (i.e. if the test particle is a boson

the system will behave as a fermion, and if the test particle is a fermion the system will

behave as a boson).

just as for the bag solution, the biggest draw back of the present solution is its innite

eld energy. the bunker solution has an asymptotic energy density proportional to

(23)

since we found  > 1 this energy density will yield an innite eld energy when integrated

over all space. this can be compared with the nite eld energy monopole and dyon solution

[4]. however, as remarked previously, it has been demonstrated [5] that the nite energy

monopole solutions do not trap a test particle while the innite energy solutions do.

what is the physical meaning of this solution ? as in the case of the bag-like solution

one can examine the motion of a test particle in the background eld of the bunker solution,

and nd in this way that the test particle will tend to remain conned due to the increasing

gauge potential. another possible interpretation is that this solution is the yang-mills

analog to the coulomb potential in electrostatics. an electron can exist as an asymptotic

state while a quark can not. therefore, the bunker solution can be thought of as the far

eld of a color charge - quark. the fact that the bunker solution possesses an innite

eld energy then indicates that an isolated quark is not allowed as an observable free state.

the coulomb solution of electrostatics also posseses an innite eld energy, but the manner

in which the eld energy becomes innite is dierent than for the bunker solution. any

point electric charge such as the electron has a singularity at r = 0, but the quark eld

of the bunker solution has a singularity at r = . to follow through on this interpretation
of the bunker solution as an isolated quark, one should investigate what happens when

two bunker solutions are placed in the vicinity of one another. in this way one might hope

that the combination of two bunker solutions would lead to a localized, nite energy eld

7

conguration. then if one tried to separate the two quarks the eld energy would become

innite. however the nonlinear character of the classical su(3) eld equations make this a

dicult problem beyond the scope of the present work. finally it can be noted that this

solution is in a sense asymptotical free since at r = 0 the gauge potential aa

  0.

iii. the gauge string

let us write down the following ansatz

a2

t = f (),

a5

z = v(),

a7

 = w(),

(24)

(25)

(26)

here we use the cylindrical coordinate system z, , . the color index a = 2, 5, 7 corresponds

to an embedding of su(2) in su(3). using eqs. (24) - (26) the yang - mills equations

become

f  +

v +

w
 

f 

v

w

= f (cid:16)v2 + w2(cid:17) ,
= v(cid:16)f 2 + w2(cid:17) ,
2 = w(cid:16)f 2 + v2(cid:17) ,

w +

let us examine the simple case w = 0 which reduces eqs. (27) - (29) to

f  +

v +

f 

v


= f v2,

= vf 2.

at origin  = 0 the solution has the following form

f = f0 + f2

v = v0 + v2

substituting eqs. (32) - (33) into (30) - (31) we nd that

f2 =

v2 = 

f0v2
0,

v0f 2

(34)

(35)

the asymptotic behaviour of the ansatz functions f, v and the energy density e can be given
as

# ,

cos (2x2 + 21)

16x3
sin (x2 + 1)

f  2"x +
v 
e  f 2 + v2 + f 2v2  const,

(36)

(37)

(38)

where x = /0 is the dimensionless radius, and 0, 1 are constants. to solve the system in

eqs. (30) - (31) for all r we again used numerical methods. a typical solution for f and v

is shown in fig. 4. as in the solution of the previous section we have a conning potential

a2

t = f () and a strongly oscillating potential a5

z = v(). depending on the relationship

between v0 and f0 the energy density near  = 0 will be either a hollow (i.e. an energy

density less than the asymptotic value) or a hump (i.e. an energy density greater than the

asymptotic value). on account of this and the cylindrical symmetry of this solution we

call this the string solution. the quotation marks indicate that this is a string from an

energetic point of view, not from the potential (aa

) or eld strength (f a

) point of view.

after quantization the oscillating functions will most likely vanish and only the conning

potential and constant energy density will remain.

this string-like solution can be thought of as describing the classical gauge eld be-

tween two quarks. similiar string-like congurations are thought to occur in the dual

superconductor picture of connement, and lattice calculations (nonperturbative quantiza-

tion) also may give evidence for such structures.

9

iv. discussion

in this paper we have examined several non-trivial classical solutions of the su(3) yang

- mills theory. each of these solutions demonstrated some type of conning behaviour,

indicating that this may be a general property of the classical su(3) yang - mills theory,

and also that some form of this behaviour may carry over to the quantized theory. these

innite energy solutions to eqs. (4) - (7) represent typical solutions to the classical eld

equations in the sense that they arise for a wide range of initial conditions. in contrast to

this the simple su(3) monopole and dyon solutions investigated in refs. [6] [10] are unique

solutions in the sense that they arise for only certain initial conditions.

in addition the

innite energy solutions investigated here give rise to a classical type of conning behaviour

which neither the su(3) solutions of refs. [6] [10] or the nite energy [3] [4] solutions possess.

the physical signicance of the spherically symmetric cases is motivated by noting the

similiarities between these solutions and various phenomenological models of connement.

the rst solution will conne a quantum test particle via the spherical singularity in the

magnetic part of the gauge eld in a manner similiar to some bag models. studies of

such bag-like eld congurations with scalar [14] and spinor [16] [17] test particles have

been carried out. in both cases it was found that the test particles were conned inside

r = r0, and in ref. [17] a somewhat realistic spectrum of hadron masses was obtained in

this way. the second solution has the electric part of the gauge eld increasing like r

for large r with  > 1. if this eld conguration is taken as representing the far eld of

an isolated quark then the innitely increasing eld strength can be taken to indicate

the impossibility of isolating an individual quark. in contrast isolated electrons exist in

nature since they generate electric elds which decrease at innity. the third solution has

a string-like structure from an energetic point of view. similiar string-like structures are

found in the dual superconductor picture of connement. just as two interacted electrons

generate an electric eld which is essentially the superposition of the electric elds of the

individual electrons, so two interacting quarks are thought to generate a string-like ux tube

10

which runs from one quark to the other. the string solution obtained above is a classical

model of such a eld distribution. it appears as a string-like structure on the background

of the eld with constant energy density. the strongly oscillating components of this and

the bunker solution will most likely be smoothed out once quantum eects are taken into

account.
