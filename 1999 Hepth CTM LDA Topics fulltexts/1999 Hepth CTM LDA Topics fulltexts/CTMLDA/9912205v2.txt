quantum aspects of eld theory. perturbation theory: expansions in loops, helicity,
and internal symmetry. although some have conjectured that nonperturbative ap-
proaches might solve renormalization diculties found in perturbation, all evidence
indicates these problems worsen instead in complete theory.

v. quantization
quantization of classical theories by path integrals. backgrounds elds instead of
sources exclusively: all uses of feynman diagrams involve either s-matrix or eective
action, both of which require removal of external propagators, equivalent to replacing
sources with elds.

scientic method

although there are many ne textbooks on quantum eld theory, they all have
various shortcomings. instinct is claimed as a basis for most discussions of quantum
eld theory, though clearly this topic is too recent to aect evolution. their subjectiv-
ity more accurately identies this as fashion: (1) the old-fashioned approach justies
itself with the instinct of intuition. however, anyone who remembers when they rst
learned quantum mechanics or special relativity knows they are counter-intuitive;
quantum eld theory is the synthesis of those two topics. thus, the intuition in this
case is probably just habit: such an approach is actually historical or traditional ,
recounting the chronological development of the subject. generally the rst half (or
volume) is devoted to quantum electrodynamics, treated in the way it was viewed in
the 1950s, while the second half tells the story of quantum chromodynamics, as it
was understood in the 1970s. such a dualistic approach is necessarily redundant,
e.g., using canonical quantization for qed but path-integral quantization for qcd,
contrary to scientic principles, which advocate applying the same unied methods
to all theories. while some teachers may feel more comfortable by beginning a topic
the way they rst learned it, students may wonder why the course didnt begin with
the approach that they will wind up using in the end. topics that are unfamiliar
to the authors intuition are often labeled as formal (lacking substance) or even
mathematical (devoid of physics). recent topics are usually treated there as ad-
vanced: the opposite is often true, since explanations simplify with time, as the topic
is better understood. on the positive side, this approach generally presents topics
with better experimental verication.

(2) in contrast, the fashionable approach is described as being based on the in-
stinct of beauty. but this subjective beauty of art is not the instinctive beauty of
nature, and in science it is merely a consolation. treatments based on this approach
are usually found in review articles rather than textbooks, due to the shorter life ex-
pectancy of the latest fashion. on the other hand, this approach has more imagination
than the traditional one, and attempts to capture the future of the subject.

a related issue in the treatment of eld theory is the relative importance of con-
cepts vs. calculations: (1) some texts emphasize the concepts, including those which
have not proven of practical value, but were considered motivational historically (in
the traditional approach) or currently (in the artistic approach). however, many ap-
proaches that were once considered at the forefront of research have faded into oblivion
not because they were proven wrong by experimental evidence or lacked conceptual
attractiveness, but because they were too complex for calculation, or so vague they
lacked predicitive ability. some methods claimed total generality, which they used to

24

prove theorems (though sometimes without examples); but ultimately the only useful
proofs of theorems are by construction. often a dualistic, two-volume approach is
again advocated (and frequently the author writes only one of the two volumes): like
the traditional approach of qed volume + qcd volume, some prefer concept volume
+ calculation volume. generally, this means that gauge theory s-matrix calculations
are omitted from the conceptual eld theory course, and left for a particle physics
course, or perhaps an advanced eld theory course. unfortunately, the particle
physics course will nd the specialized techniques of gauge theory too technical to
cover, while the advanced eld theory course will frighten away many students by its
title alone.

(2) on the other hand, some authors express a desire to introduce feynman graphs
as quickly as possible: this suggests a lack of appreciation of eld theory outside of
diagrammatics. many essential aspects of eld theory (such as symmetry breaking
and the higgs eect) can be seen only from the action, and its analysis also leads to
better methods of applying perturbation theory than those obtained from a xed set
of rules. also, functional equations are often simpler than pictorial ones, especially
when they are nonlinear in the elds. the result of over-emphasizing the calculations
is a cookbook, of the kind familiar from some lower-division undergraduate courses
intended for physics majors but designed for engineers.

the best explanation of a theory is the one that ts the principles of scientic
method : simplicity, generality, and experimental verication.
in this text we thus
take a more economical or pragmatic approach, with methods based on eciency
and power. unattractiveness or counter-intuitiveness of such methods become ad-
vantages, because they force one to accept new and better ways of thinking about
the subject: the eciency of the method directs one to the underlying idea. for
example, although some consider einsteins original explanation of special relativity
in terms of relativistic trains and lorentz transformations with square roots as be-
ing more physical, the concept of minkowski space gave a much simpler explanation
and deeper understanding that proved more useful and led to generalization. many
theories have miraculous cancelations when traditional methods are used, which
led to new methods (background eld gauge, supergraphs, spacecone, etc.) that not
only incorporate the cancelations automatically (so that the zeros need not be cal-
culated), but are built on the principles that explain them. we place an emphasis
on such new concepts, as well as the calculational methods that allow them to be
compared with nature. it is important not to neglect one for the sake of the other,
articial and misleading to try to separate them.

as a result, many of our explanations of the standard topics are new to textbooks,

and some are completely new. for example:

25

(1) we derive the foldy-wouthuysen transformation by dimensional reduction from

an analogous one for the massless case (subsections iib3,5).

(2) we derive the feynman rules in terms of background elds rather than sources
(subsection vc1); this avoids the need for amputation of external lines for s-
matrices or eective actions, and is more useful for background-eld gauges.

(3) we obtain the nonrelativistic qed eective action, used in modern treatments
of the lamb shift (because it makes perturbation easier than the older bethe-
salpeter methods), by eld redenition of the relativistic eective action (sub-
section viiib6), rather than tting parameters by comparing feynman diagrams
from the relativistic and nonrelativistic actions. (in general, manipulations in the
action are easier than in diagrams.)

(4) we present two somewhat new methods for solving for the covariant derivatives
and curvature in general relativity that are slightly easier than all previous meth-
ods (subsections ixa2,a7,c5).

there are also some completely new topics, like:
(1) the anti-gervais-neveu gauge, where spin in u(n) yang-mills is treated in al-
most the same way as internal symmetry  with chan-paton factors (subsection
vib4);

(2) the superspacecone gauge, the simplest gauge for qcd (subsection vib7); and
(3) a new (almost-)rst-order superspace action for supergravity, analogous to the

one for super yang-mills (subsection xb1).
we try to give the simplest possible calculational tools, not only for the above
reasons, but also so group theory (internal and spacetime) and integrals can be per-
formed with the least eort and memory. some traditionalists may claim that the old
methods are easy enough, but their arguments are less convincing when the order of
perturbation is increased. even computer calculations are more ecient when left as
a last resort; and you cant see whats going on when the computers doing the calcu-
lating, so you dont gain any new understanding. we give examples of (and exercises
on) these methods, but not exhaustively. we also include more recent topics (or those
more recently appreciated in the particle physics community) that might be deemed
non-introductory, but are commonly used, and are simple and important enough to
include at the earliest level. for example, the related topics of (unitary) lightcone
gauge, twistors, and spinor helicity are absent from all eld theory texts, and as a
result no such text performs the calculation of as basic a diagram as the 4-gluon
tree amplitude. another missing topic is the relation of qcd to strings through the
random worldsheet lattice and large-color (1/n) expansion, which is the only known
method that might quantitatively describe its high-energy nonperturbative behavior
(bound states of arbitrarily large mass).

26

this text is meant to cover all the eld theory every high energy theorist should
know, but not all that any particular theorist might need to know. it is not meant as
an introduction to research, but as a preliminary to such courses: we try to ll in the
cracks that often lie between standard eld theory courses and advanced specialized
courses. for example, we have some discussion of string theory, but it is more oriented
toward the strong interactions, where it has some experimental justication, rather
than quantum gravity and unication, where its usefulness is still under investigation.
we do not mention statistical mechanics, although many of the eld theory methods
we discuss are useful there. also, we do not discuss any experimental results in detail;
phenomenology and analysis of experiments deserve their own text. we give and apply
the methods of calculation and discuss the qualitative features of the results, but do
not make a numerical comparison to nature: we concentrate more on the forest
than the trees.

unfortunately, our discussions of the (somewhat related) topics of infrared-diver-
gence cancelation, lamb shift, and the parton model are sketchy, due to our inability
to give fully satisfying treatments  but maybe in a later edition?

unlike all previous texts on quantum eld theory, this one is available for free
over the internet (as usual, from arxiv.org and its mirrors), and may be periodically
updated. errata, additions, and other changes will be posted on my web page at
http://insti.physics.sunysb.edu/siegel/plan.html until enough are accumulated for a
new edition. electronic distribution has many advantages:
 its free.
 its available quickly and easily. you can download it from the arxive.org or its
mirrors, just like preprints, without a trip to the library (where it may be checked
out) or bookstore or waiting for an order from the publisher. (if your connection
is slow, download overnight.) and it wont go out of print.

 download it at work, home, etc. (or carry it on a cd), rather than carrying a

book or printing multiple copies.

 get updates just as quickly, rather than printing yet again.
 it has the usual web links, so you can get the referenced papers just as easily.
 it has a separate outline window containing a table of contents on which you

can click to take the main window to that item.

 you can electronically search (do a nd on) the text.
 easier to read on the computer screen (arbitrary magnication, etc.)
 save trees, ink, and space.
 theft is not a problem.
 no wear or tear.
 no paper cuts.

 if you have adobe acrobat (not just reader) you can even add notes far bigger

than would t in the margin.

highlights

the preceding table of contents lists the three parts of the text: symmetry,
quanta, and higher spin. each part is divided into four chapters, each of which has
three sections, divided further into subsections. each section is followed by references
to reviews and original papers. exercises appear throughout the text, immediately
following the items they test: this purposely disrupts the ow of the text, forcing
the reader to stop and think about what he has just learned. these exercises are
interesting in their own right, and not just examples or memory tests. this is not a
crime for homeworks and exams, which at least by graduate school should be about
more than just grades.

this text also diers from others in most of the following ways:

(1) we place a greater emphasis on mechanics in introducing some of the more ele-

mentary physical concepts of eld theory:
(a) some basic ideas, such as antiparticles, can be more simply understood al-

ready with classical mechanics.

(b) some interactions can also be treated through rst-quantization: this is suf-
cient for evaluating certain tree and one-loop graphs as particles in external
elds. also, schwinger parameters can be understood from rst-quantization:
they are useful for performing momentum integrals (reducing them to gaus-
sians), studying the high-energy behavior of feynman graphs, and nding
their singularities in a way that exposes their classical mechanics interpreta-
tion.

(c) quantum mechanics is very similar to free classical eld theory, by the usual
semiclassical correspondence (duality) between particles (mechanics) and
waves (elds). they use the same wave equations, since the mechanics hamil-
tonian or becchi-rouet-stora-tyutin operator is the kinetic operator of the
corresponding classical eld theory, so the free theories are equivalent.
in
particular, (relativistic) quantum mechanical brst provides a simple ex-
planation of the o-shell degrees of freedom of general gauge theories, and
introduces concepts useful in string theory. as in the nonrelativistic case,
this treatment starts directly with quantum mechanics, rather than by (rst-
)quantization of a classical mechanical system. since supersymmetry and
strings are so important in present theoretical research, it is useful to have a
text that includes the eld theory concepts that are prerequisites to a course

28

on these topics.
similarly to yang-mills, we also discuss general relativity.)

(for the same reason, and because it can be treated so

(2) we also emphasize conformal invariance. although a badly broken symmetry,
the fact that it is larger than poincare invariance makes it useful in many ways:
(a) general classical theories can be described most simply by rst analyzing
conformal theories, and then introducing mass scales by various techniques.
this is particularly useful for the general analysis of free theories, for nding
solutions in gravity theories, and for constructing actions for supergravity
theories.

(b) quantum theories that are well-dened within perturbation theory are confor-
mal (scaling) at high energies. (a possible exception is string theories, but
the supposedly well understood string theories that are nite perturbatively
have been discovered to be hard-to-quantize membranes in disguise nonper-
turbatively.) this makes methods based on conformal invariance useful for
nding classical solutions, as well as studying the high-energy behavior of the
quantum theory, and simplifying the calculation of amplitudes.

(c) theories whose conformal invariance is not (further) broken by quantum cor-
rections avoid certain problems at the nonperturbative level. thus conformal
theories ultimately may be required for an unambiguous description of high-
energy physics.

(3) we make extensive use of two-component (chiral) spinors, which are ubiquitous

in particle physics:
(a) the method of twistors (more recently dubbed spinor helicity) greatly sim-
plies the lorentz algebra in feynman diagrams for massless (or high-energy)
particles with spin, and its now a standard in qcd. (twistors are also re-
lated to conformal invariance and self-duality.) on the other hand, most texts
still struggle with 4-component dirac (rather than 2-component weyl) spinor
notation, which requires gamma-matrix and fierz identities, when discussing
qcd calculations.

(b) chirality and duality are important concepts in all the interactions: two-
component spinors were rst found useful for weak interactions in the days
of 4-fermion interactions. chiral symmetry in strong interactions has been
important since the early days of pion physics; the related topic of instantons
(self-dual solutions) is simplied by two-component notation, and general
self-dual solutions are expressed in terms of twistors. duality is simplest in
two-component spinor notation, even when applied to just the electromagnetic
eld.

29

(c) supersymmetry still has no convincing experimental verication (at least not
at the moment im typing this), but its theoretical properties promise to solve
many of the fundamental problems of quantum eld theory. it is an element of
most of the proposed generalizations of the standard model. chiral symmetry
is built into supersymmetry, making two-component spinors unavoidable.

(4) the topics are ordered in a more pedagogical manner:

(a) abelian and nonabelian gauge theories are treated together using modern

techniques. (classical gravity is treated with the same methods.)

(b) classical yang-mills theory is discussed before any quantum eld theory. this
allows much of the physics, such as the standard model (which may appeal to
a wider audience), of which yang-mills is an essential part, to be introduced
earlier. in particular, symmetries and mass generation in the standard model
appear already at the classical level, and can be seen more easily from the
action (classically) or eective action (quantum) than from diagrams.

(c) only the method of path integrals is used for second-quantization. canonical
quantization is more cumbersome and hides lorentz invariance, as has been
emphasized even by feynman when he introduced his diagrams. we thus
avoid such spurious concepts as the dirac sea, which supposedly explains
positrons while being totally inapplicable to bosons. however, for quantum
physics of general systems or single particles, operator methods are more
powerful than any type of rst-quantization of a classical system, and path
integrals are mainly of pedagogical interest. we therefore review quantum
physics rst, discussing various properties (path integrals, s-matrices, unitar-
ity, brst, etc.) in a general (but simpler) framework, so that these properties
need not be rederived for the special case of quantum eld theory, for which
path-integral methods are then sucient as well as preferable.

(5) gauge xing is discussed in a way more general and ecient than older methods:
(a) the best gauge for studying unitarity is the (unitary) lightcone gauge. this
rarely appears in eld theory texts, or is treated only half way, missing the
important explicit elimination of all unphysical degrees of freedom.

(b) ghosts are introduced by brst symmetry, which proves unitarity by showing
equivalence of convenient and manifestly covariant gauges to the manifestly
unitary lightcone gauge.
it can be applied directly to the classical action,
avoiding the explicit use of functional determinants of the older faddeev-
popov method.
it also allows direct introduction of more general gauges
(again at the classical level) through the use of nakanishi-lautrup elds
(which are omitted in older treatments of brst), rather than the functional
averaging over landau gauges required by the faddeev-popov method.

30

(c) for nonabelian gauge theories the background eld gauge is a must. it makes
the eective action gauge invariant, so slavnov-taylor identities need not be
applied to it. beta functions can be found from just propagator corrections.
(6) dimensional regularization is used exclusively (with the exception of one-loop

axial anomaly calculations):
(a) it is the only one that preserves all possible symmetries, as well as being the

only one practical enough for higher-loop calculations.

(b) we also use it exclusively for infrared regularization, allowing all divergences
to be regularized with a single regulator (in contrast, e.g., to the three regu-
lators used for the standard treatment of lamb shift).

(c) it is good not only for regularization, but renormalization (dimensional
renormalization). for example, the renormalization group is most simply de-
scribed using dimensional regularization methods. more importantly, renor-
malization itself is performed most simply by a minimal prescription implied
by dimensional regularization. unfortunately, many books, even among those
that use dimensional regularization, apply more complicated renormalization
procedures that require additional, nite renormalizations as prescribed by
slavnov-taylor identities. this is a needless duplication of eort that ignores
the manifest gauge invariance whose preservation led to the choice of dimen-
sional regularization in the rst place. by using dimensional renormalization,
gauge theories are as easy to treat as scalar theories: brst does not have to
be applied to amplitudes explicitly, since the dimensional regularization and
renormalization procedure preserves it.

(7) perhaps the most fundamental omission in most eld theory texts is the expansion

of qcd in the inverse of the number of colors:
(a) it provides a gauge-invariant organization of graphs into subsets, allowing
simplications of calculations at intermediate stages, and is commonly used
in qcd today.

(b) it is useful as a perturbation expansion, whose experimental basis is the

okubo-zweig-iizuka rule.

(c) at the nonperturbative level, it leads to a resummation of diagrams in a way
that can be associated with strings, suggesting an explanation of connement.
(8) our treatment of gravity is closely related to that applied to yang-mills theory,

and diers from that of most texts on gravity:
(a) we emphasize the action for deriving eld equations for gravity (and matter),

rather than treating it as an afterthought.

(b) we make use of local (weyl) scale invariance for cosmological and spherically
symmetric solutions, gauge xing, eld redenitions, and studying conformal

31

properties. in particular, other texts neglect the (unphysical) dilaton, which
is crucial in such treatments (especially for generalization to supergravity and
strings).

(c) while most gravity texts leave spinors till the end, and treat them briey,
our discussion of gravity is based on methods that can be applied directly to
spinors, and therefore to supergravity and superstrings.

(d) our methods of calculating curvatures for purposes of solving the classical
eld equations are somewhat new, but probably the simplest, and are directly
related to the simplest methods for super yang-mills theory and supergravity.

notes for instructors

this text is intended for reference and as the basis for a full-year course on
relativistic quantum eld theory for second-year graduate students. a preliminary
version of the rst two parts was used for a one-year course i taught at stony brook,
and more recently the same with version 1. the chapter on gravity and pieces of early
chapters cover a one-semester graduate relativity course i gave several times here 
i used most of the following: ia, ib3, ic2, iia, iiia-c5, vib1, ix, xia2-4, xib4-
5. the prerequisites (for the quantum eld theory course) are the usual rst-year
courses in classical mechanics, classical electrodynamics, and quantum mechanics.
for example, the student should be familiar with hamiltonians and lagrangians,
lorentz transformations for particles and electromagnetism, green functions for wave
equations, su(2) and spin, and hilbert space. unfortunately, i nd that many second-
year graduate students (especially many who got their undergraduate training in the
usa) still have only an undergraduate level of understanding of the prerequisite
topics, lacking a working knowledge of action principles, commutators, creation and
annihilation operators, etc. while most such topics are briey reviewed here, they
should be learned elsewhere.

there is far more material here than can be covered comfortably in one year,
mostly because of included material that should be covered earlier, but rarely is.
ideally, a modern curriculum for eld theory students should include:
(1) courses on classical mechanics, nonrelativistic quantum mechanics, and classical
electrodynamics in the rst semester of graduate study, without overly reviewing
aspects that should have been covered in undergraduate study (and in particular
avoiding the enormous overlap of the last two subjects due to both covering
primarily the solution of wave equations);

(2) in the second semester, statistical mechanics as the sequel to classical, relativistic
quantum mechanics as the sequel to nonrelativistic, and classical nonabelian eld
theory (yang-mills and gravity) as the sequel to classical electrodynamics;

32

(3) in the second year, one year of quantum eld theory, and at least one semester
on phenomenology (model-building and direct comparison with observations,
including those for general relativity and cosmology); and

(4) in the third year, more specialized courses, such as a semester on supersymmetry

and strings.

unfortunately, in practice little of relativistic quantum mechanics and classical eld
theory (other than electromagnetism) will have been covered previously, which means
they will comprise half of the quantum eld theory course, while the true quantum
eld theory will be squeezed into the last half.

an alternative is to start eld theory one semester earlier: the courses of the rst
year, second semester are not really needed to start eld theory (although some of the
topics of second-semester quantum mechanics, like scattering theory, might be useful
for second-semester eld theory). then eld theory can be extended into a 3-semester
course (or the third semester can be replaced with other advanced courses).

one way to cut the material to t a one-year course is to omit part three, which
can be left for a third semester on advanced quantum eld theory; then the rst
semester (part one) is classical while the second (part two) is quantum. further-
more, the ordering of the chapters is somewhat exible: the ow is indicated by
the following 3d plot:

lower spin

 

higher spin



classical

symmetry
i

elds
iii



quantum

quantize
v

loop
vii

ix

x

xi

xii

bose


fermi

ii

iv

vi

viii

where the 3 dimensions are spin (j), quantization (h), and statistics (s): the
three independent ows are down the page, to the right, and into the page. (the third
dimension has been represented as perpendicular to the page, with higher spin in
smaller type to indicate perspective, for legibility.) to present these chapters in the
1 dimension of time we have classied them as jhs, but other orderings are possible:

jhs :
jsh :
hjs :
hsj :
sjh :
shj :

i ii iii iv v vi vii viii ix x xi xii
i iii v vii ii iv vi viii ix xi x xii
i ii iii iv ix x v vi xi xii vii viii
i ii iii ix iv x v xi vi xii vii viii
i iii v vii ix xi ii iv vi viii x xii
i iii ix v xi vii ii iv x vi xii viii

33

(however, the spinor notation of ii is used for discussing instantons in iii, so some
rearrangement would be required, except in the jhs, hjs, and hsj cases.) for exam-
ple, the rst half of the course can cover all of the classical, and the second quantum,
dividing part three between them (hjs or hsj). another alternative (jsh) is a one-
semester course on quantum eld theory, followed by a semester on the standard
model, and nishing with supergravity and strings. although some of these (espe-
cially the rst two) allow division of the course into one-semester courses, this should
not be used as an excuse to treat such courses as complete: any particle physics
student who was content to sit through another entire year of quantum mechanics in
graduate school should be prepared to take at least a year of eld theory.

notes for students

field theory is a hard course. (if you dont think so, name me a harder one at this
level.) but you knew as an undergraduate that physics was a hard major. students
who plan to do research in eld theory will nd the topic challenging; those with less
enthusiasm for the topic may nd it overwhelming. the main dierence between eld
theory and lower courses is that it is not set in stone: there is much more variation in
style and content among eld theory courses than, e.g., quantum mechanics courses,
since quantum mechanics (to the extent taught in courses) was pretty much nished
in the 1920s, while eld theory is still an active research topic, even though it has had
many experimentally conrmed results since the 1940s. as a result, a eld theory
course has the avor of research: there is no set of mathematically rigorous rules to
solve any problem. answers are not nal, and should be treated as questions: one
should not be satised with the solution of a problem, but consider it as a rst step
toward generalization. the student should not expect to capture all the details of
eld theory the rst time through, since many of them are not yet fully understood
by people who work in the area. (it is far more likely that instead you will discover
details that you missed in earlier courses.) and one reminder: the only reason for
lectures (including seminars and conferences) is for the attendees to ask questions
(and not just in private), and there are no stupid questions (except for the infamous
how many questions are on the exam?). only half of teaching is the responsibility
of the instructor.

some students who have a good undergraduate background may want to begin
graduate school taking eld theory. that can be dicult, so you should be sure you
have a good understanding of most of the following topics:
(1) classical mechanics: hamiltonians, lagrangians, actions; lorentz transforma-

tions; poisson brackets

34

(2) classical electrodynamics: lagrangian for electromagnetism; lorentz transfor-
mations for electromagnetic elds, 4-vector potential, 4-vector lorentz force law;
green functions

(3) quantum mechanics: coupling to electromagnetism; spin, su(2), symmetries;
green functions for schrodinger equation; hilbert space, commutators, heisen-
berg and schrodinger pictures; creation and annihilation operators, statistics
(bosons and fermions); jwkb expansion

it is not necessary to be familiar with all these topics, and most will be briey
reviewed, but if most of these topics are not familiar then there will not be enough
time to catch up. a standard undergraduate education in these three courses is not
enough.

version 2

this update contains no new topics or subsections, but many small changes
(amounting to a 10% increase in size): corrections, improved explanations, exam-
ples, (20% more) exercises, gures, references, cosmetics (including more color), and
an expanded outline and aftermath. there are also a few small additions, such as a
more fundamental explanation of causality and unitarity in quantum mechanics, and
the use of weyl scaling as a general method for spherical (as well as cosmological)
solutions to einsteins equations. it now texs with either ordinary tex or pdftex.

part one: symmetry

the rst four chapters present a one-semester course on classical eld theory.
perhaps a more accurate description would be everything you should know before
learning quantum eld theory. this is basically a study of global and local symme-
tries: classical dynamics represents only a certain limit of quantum dynamics, and not
the one usually emphasized, but most of the symmetries of classical physics survive
quantization. the phenomenon of symmetry breaking, and the related mechanisms of
mass generation, can also be seen at the classical level. in perturbative quantum eld
theory, classical eld theory is simply the leading term in the perturbation expansion.

continuous symmetry is one of the most fundamental and important concepts
of physics. in the framework of an action principle (which is required in quantum
physics), it is equivalent to conservation laws, which have been a cornerstone of physics
since newton. from a practical viewpoint, it simplies calculations by relating dier-
ent solutions to equations of motion, and allowing these equations to be written more
concisely by treating independent degrees of freedom as a single entity. in particular,
local (gauge) symmetries, which allow independent transformations at each coordi-
nate point, are basic to all the fundamental interactions: all the fundamental forces
are mediated by particles described by yang-mills theory and its generalizations.

symmetries are the result of a redundant, but useful, description of a theory.
(note that here we refer to symmetries of a theory, not of a solution to the theory.) for
example, translation invariance says that only dierences in position are measurable,
not absolute position: we cant measure the position of the origin. there are two
ways to deal with this: (1) choose an origin; i.e., make a choice of coordinates.
for example, place an object at the origin; i.e., choose the position of an object at
a certain time to be the origin. (2) work only in terms of dierences of coordinates,
which are translationally invariant. although the latter choice is more physical,
the former is usually more convenient: the use of redundant variables, together with
symmetry, often gives a simpler description of a theory. another example is quantum
mechanics, where the arbitrariness of the phase of the wave function can be considered
a symmetry: although quantum mechanics can be reformulated in terms of phase-
invariant probabilities, currents, or density matrices instead of wave functions, and
this can be useful for some purposes of exposing physical properties, formulating and
solving the schrodinger equation is simpler in terms of the wave function. the same
applies to local symmetries, where there is an independent symmetry at each point
of space and time: for example, quarks and gluons have a local color symmetry,

38

and are not (yet) observed independently in nature, but are simpler objects in terms

of which to describe strong interactions than the observed hadrons (protons, neutrons,

etc.), which are described by color-invariant products of quark/gluon wave functions,

in the same way that probabilities are phase-invariant products of wave functions.

(note that in quantum mechanics there is a subtle distinction between observed and

observer that can obscure this symmetry if the observer is not invariant under it. this

can always be avoided by choosing to dene the observer as invariant: for example,

the detection apparatus can be included as part of the quantum mechanical system,

while the observer can be dened as some remote recorder, who may be abstracted

as even being translationally invariant. in practice we are less precise, and abstract

even the detection apparatus to be invariant: for example, we describe the scattering

of particles in terms of the coordinates of only the particles, and deal with the origin

problem as above in terms of just those coordinates.)

note that global (time-, and usually space-independent) symmetries can elim-

inate a variable, but not its time derivative. for example, translation invariance

allows us to x (i.e., eliminate) the position of the center of mass of a system at some

initial time, but not its time derivative, which is just the total momentum, whose

conservation is a consequence of that same symmetry. a local symmetry, being time

dependent, may allow the elimination of a variable at all times: the existence of this

possibility depends on the dynamics, and will be discussed later.

of particular interest are ways in which symmetries can be made manifest. fre-

quently in the literature manifest is used vacuously; a manifest symmetry is an

obvious one: if you know the group, the representation under consideration doesnt

need to be stated, but can be seen from just the notation. (in fact, one of the main

uses of index notation is just to manifest the symmetry.) formulations where global

and local symmetries are manifest simplify calculations and their results, as well as

clarifying their meaning.

one of the main uses of manifest symmetry is rarely needing to explicitly perform

a specic symmetry transformation. for example, one might need to examine a rela-

tivistic problem in dierent lorentz frames. rather than starting with a description

of the problem in one frame, and then explicitly transforming to another, it is much

simpler to start with a manifestly covariant description, make one choice of frame,

then make another choice of frame. one then never uses the messy square roots of the

familiar lorentz contraction factors (although they may appear at the end from kine-

matic constraints). a more extreme example is the corresponding situation for local

a. coordinates

39

symmetries, where such transformations are intractable in general, and one always
starts with the manifestly covariant form.

in the rst chapter we study symmetry in general, concentrating primarily on
spacetime symmetries, but also discussing general properties that will have other
applications in the following chapter.

in this section we discuss the poincare (and conformal) group as coordinate trans-
formations. this is the simplest way to represent it on the physical world. in later
sections we nd general representations by adding spin.

1. nonrelativity

we begin by reviewing some general properties of symmetries, including as an
example the symmetry group of nonrelativistic physics. in the hamiltonian approach
to mechanics, both symmetries and dynamics can be expressed conveniently in terms
of a bracket: the poisson bracket for classical mechanics, the commutator for quan-
tum mechanics. in this formulation, the fundamental variables (operators) are some
set of coordinates and their canonically conjugate momenta, as functions of time.
the (heisenberg) operator approach to quantum mechanics then is related to classi-
cal mechanics by identifying the semiclassical limit of the commutator as the poisson
bracket: for any functions a and b of p and q, the quantum mechanical commutator
is

in other words, the true classical limit of ab  ba is zero, since classically functions
commute; thus the semiclassical limit is dened by

h0(cid:20) 1

lim

h

(ab  ba)(cid:21)

(which is really a derivative with respect to h). we therefore dene the bracket for
the two cases by

[a, b] 

b
qm 

i(cid:18) a

pm
ab  ba

b
pm

a

qm(cid:19) semiclassically

quantum mechanically

ab  ba = ih(cid:18) a

pm

b
qm 

b
pm

a

qm(cid:19) + o(h2)

40

i. global

the semiclassical denition of the bracket then can be applied to classical physics
(where it was originally discovered). classically a and b are two arbitrary functions
of the coordinates q and momenta p; in quantum mechanics they can be arbitrary
operators. we have included an i in the classical normalization so the two agree
in the semiclassical limit. we generally use (natural/planck) units h = 1, so mass is
measured as inverse length, etc.; when we do use an explicit h, it is a dimensionless
parameter, and appears only for dening jeries-wentzel-kramers-brillouin (jwkb)
expansions or (semi)classical limits.

our indices may appear either as subscripts or superscripts, with preferences to
be explained later: for nonrelativistic purposes we treat them the same. we also use
the einstein summation convention, that any repeated index in a product is summed
over (contracted); usually we contract a superscript with a subscript:

ambm xm

ambm

the denition of the bracket is equivalent to using

[pm, qn] = in

m

(where n
the general properties of the bracket

m is the kronecker delta function: 1 if m = n, 0 if m 6= n) together with

[a, b] = [a, b]
[a, b] = [b, a],
[[a, b], c] + [[b, c], a] + [[c, a], b] = 0

[a, bc] = [a, b]c + b[a, c]

the rst set of identities exhibit the antisymmetry of the bracket; next are the ja-
cobi identities. in the last identity the ordering is important only in the quantum
mechanical case: in general, the dierence between classical and quantum mechanics
comes from the fact that in the quantum case operator reordering after taking the
commutator results in multiple commutators.

innitesimal symmetry transformations are then written as

a = i[g, a],

a = a + a

where g is the generator of the transformation. more explicitly, innitesimal gen-
erators will contain innitesimal parameters: for example, for translations we have

g = ipi  xi = i[g, xi] = i,

pi = 0

a. coordinates

41

where i are innitesimal numbers.

the most evident physical symmetries are those involving spacetime. for nonrel-
ativistic particles, these symmetries form the galilean group: for the free particle,
those innitesimal transformations are linear combinations of

p2
i
2m

,

m = m, pi = pi,

jij = x[ipj]  xipj  xjpi, e = h =

vi = mxi  pit
in terms of the position xi (i = 1, 2, 3), momenta pi, and (nonvanishing) mass m,
where [ij] means to antisymmetrize in those indices, by summing over all permuta-
tions (just two in this case), with plus signs for even permutations and minus for odd.
(in three spatial dimensions, one often writes ji = 1
2ijkjjk to make j into a vector.
this is a peculiarity of three dimensions, and will lose its utility once we consider rela-
tivity in four spacetime dimensions.) these transformations are the space translations
(momentum) p , rotations (angular momentum  just orbital for the spinless case)
j, time translations (energy) e, and velocity transformations (galilean boosts)
v . (the mass m is not normally associated with a symmetry, and is not conserved
relativistically.)

exercise ia1.1

lets examine the galilean group more closely. using just the relations for
[x, p] and [a, bc] (and the antisymmetry of the bracket):

a find the action on xi of each kind of innitesimal galilean transformation.

b show that the nonvanishing commutation relations for the generators are

[jij, pk] = ik[ipj],

[jij, vk] = ik[ivj],

[jij, j kl] = i[k

[i jj]

l]

[pi, vj] = iijm,

[h, vi] = ipi

for more than one free particle, we introduce an m, xi, and pi for each particle
(but the same t), and the generators are the sums over all particles of the above ex-
pressions. if the particles interact with each other the expression for h is modied, in
such a way as to preserve the commutation relations. if the particles also interact with
dynamical elds, eld-dependent terms must be added to the generators. (external,
nondynamical elds break the invariance. for example, a particle in a coulomb po-
tential is not translation invariant since the potential is centered about some point.)
note that for n particles there are 3n coordinates describing the particles, but still
only 3 translations: the particles interact in the same 3-dimensional space. we can
use translational invariance to x the position of any one particle at a given time, but
not the rest: the dierences in position are translationally invariant. on the other

42

i. global

hand, it is often useful not to x the position of any particle, since keeping this invari-
ance (and the corresponding redundant variables) allows all particles to be treated
equally. we might also consider using the dierences of positions themselves as the
variables, allowing a symmetric treatment of the particles in terms of translationally
invariant variables: however, this would require applying constraints on the variables,
since there are 3n(n1)/2 dierences, of which only 3(n1) are independent. we
will nd similar features later for local invariances: in general, the most convenient
description of a theory is with the invariance; the invariance can then be xed, or
invariant combinations of variables used, appropriately for the particular application.

the rotations (or at least their orbital parts) and space translations are exam-
ples of coordinate transformations. in general, generators of coordinate transforma-
tions are of the form

g = i(x)pi  (x) = i[g, ] = ii

where i = /xi and (x) is a scalar eld (or spin-0 wave function), a function
of only the coordinates.

in classical mechanics, or quantum mechanics in the heisenberg picture, time

development also can be expressed in terms of the hamiltonian using the bracket:

d
dt

a =(cid:20) 

t

+ ih, a(cid:21) =


t

a + i[h, a]

(the middle expression with the commutator of /t makes sense only in the quantum
case, and is not dened for the poisson bracket.) again, this general relation is
equivalent to the special cases, which in the classical limit are hamiltons equations
of motion:

dqm
dt

= i[h, qm] =

h
pm

,

dpm
dt

= i[h, pm] = 

h
qm

the hamiltonian has no explicit time dependence in the absence of time-dependent
nondyamical elds (external potentials whose time dependence is xed by hand,
rather than by introducing the elds and their conjugate variables into the hamilto-
nian). consequently, time development is itself a symmetry: time translations are
generated by the hamiltonian; the /t term in d/dt term can be dropped when
acting on operators without explicit time dependence.

invariance of the theory under a symmetry means that the equations of motion

are unchanged under the transformation:

(cid:18)da
dt(cid:19)

=

da
dt

a. coordinates

43

to apply our above translation of innitesimal transformations into bracket language,

we dene (d/dt) by

in the quantum case we can write

dt

(cid:18) d
a(cid:19) = (cid:18) d
(cid:18) d
dt(cid:19) =(cid:20)(cid:20)ig,

dt(cid:19) a +
+ ih(cid:21) ,


t

d
dt

a

(cid:21)

which follows from the jacobi identity using b = ig and c = /t+ih, and inserting

a into the blank spaces of the commutators above. (the classical case can be treated

similarly, except that the time derivatives are not written as brackets.) we then nd

that the generator of a symmetry transformation is conserved (constant), since

0 = (cid:18) d

dt(cid:19) =(cid:20)i

g
t  [g, h],

(cid:21) = i(cid:20) dg

dt

,

(cid:21)

exercise ia1.2

show that the generators of the galilean group are conserved:

a use the relation d/dt = /t + i[h, ] for the hamiltonian h of a free particle.

b solve the equations of motion for x(t) and p(t) in terms of initial conditions,

and substitute into the expression for the generators to give an independent

derivation of their time independence.

note that in the case where the galilean symmetry persists for interacting mul-

tiparticle systems, (total) mass is conserved. in particular, invariance under transla-

tions and velocity transformations implies mass conservation.

in the cases where time dependence is not involved, symmetries can be treated

in almost exactly the same way either classically or quantum mechanically using the

corresponding bracket (poisson or commutator), by using the properties that they
have in common. in particular, the fact that a symmetry generator g = m(x)pm is
conserved means that we can solve for a component of p in terms of the constant g,

and substitute the result into the remaining equations of motion, and that the con-

jugate to that component doesnt appear in h. for example, translation invariance

of a potential in a particular direction means that component of the momentum is a
constant (dp1/dt = h/q1 = 0), rotational invariance about some axis means that
component of angular momentum is a constant (dj/dt = h/ = 0), etc.

2. fermions

as we learned in our quantum mechanics course, two particles of the same type
are indistinguishable. furthermore, while an arbitrary number of bosons (particles
satisfying bose-einstein statistics) can each exist in the same one-particle state, only
one (or zero) fermions can exist in the same one-particle state. (for example, we can
have a state consisting of 17 photons each of the same momentum and each of the
same polarization, and we cant tell which is which, but we can only have 1 electron
in such a state.) in terms of wave functions, e.g., a 2-particle wave function, made
from 1-particle wave functions of the form i(x) (where x labels the spatial position
and i other properties), we conveniently dene

bosons : ii(x, x) = +ii(x, x)
f ermions : ii(x, x) = ii(x, x)

for x = x and i = i the signs (which could be phases, but are chosen real for
convenience) are chosen so ii(x, x) vanishes for fermions but not necessarily for
bosons, so no 2 fermions are in the same state. for other cases the relation avoids
double counting for the 2 particles being switched; the signs are arbitrary, but are
chosen consistently with the previous case so that the relation is local. the symmetry
of wave functions for bosons and antisymmetry for fermions corresponds to operators
that commute for bosons and anticommute for fermions (or for properties associated
with fermions).

as we know experimentally, and we will see follows from relativistic eld theory,
particles with half-integral spins obey fermi-dirac statistics. lets therefore consider
the classical limit of fermions: this will lead to generalizations of the concepts of
brackets and coordinates. bosons (more generally, bosonic operators) obey commu-
tation relations, such as [x, p] = ih; in the classical limit they just commute. fermions
obey anticommutation relations, such as {, } = h for a single fermionic harmonic
oscillator, where

{a, b} = ab + ba

is the anticommutator. so, in the truly classical (not semiclassical) limit they an-
ticommute,  +  = 0. actually, the simplest case is a single real (hermitian)
fermion: quantum mechanically, or semiclassically, we have

h = {, } = 22

while classically 2 = 0. there is no analog for a single boson: [x, x] = x2  x2 = 0.
this means that classical fermionic elds must be anticommuting: two such objects

a. coordinates

45

get a minus sign when pushed past each other. as a result, the product of two
fermionic quantities is bosonic, while fermionic times bosonic gives fermionic.

exercise ia2.1

show

[b, c] = [a, d] = 0  [ab, cd] = 1

2{a, c}[b, d] + 1

2[a, c]{b, d}

to work with wave functions that are functions of anticommuting numbers, we
rst must understand how to dene general properties of functions of anticommuting
variables. for instance, given a single anticommuting variable , we need to be able
to taylor expand functions in , e.g., to nd a basis for the states. we therefore have
an anticommuting derivative /, satisfying

(cid:19)2
(cid:18) 

= 0

from either anticommutativity or the fact functions of  terminate at rst order in .
we also need a  integral to dene the inner product; indenite integration turns out
to be enough. the most important property of the integral is integration by parts;
then, when acting on any function of ,

z d




= 0  z d =




where the normalization is xed for convenience. this also implies a denition of the
(anticommuting) dirac delta function,

() = 

z d (  )f () = f ()

which satises

for any function f .

exercise ia2.2

prove this is the most general possibility for anticommuting integration by
considering action of integration and dierentiation on the most general func-
tion of  (which has only two terms).

in general, when taylor expanding a function of anticommuting variables we must
preserve the statistics: if we taylor expand a quantity that is dened to be commuting
(bosonic), then the coecients of even powers of anticommuting variables will also be
commuting, while the coecients of odd powers will be anticommuting (fermionic),

46

i. global

to maintain the commuting nature of that term (the product of the variables and
coecient). similarly, when expanding an anticommuting quantity the coecients of
even powers will also be anticommuting, while for odd powers it will be commuting.

we can now consider operators that depend on both commuting (m) and anti-

commuting () classical variables,

m = (m, )

classically they satisfy the graded commutation relations (anticommutation if both
elements are fermionic, commutation otherwise), not to be confused with the poisson
bracket,

classically

[m , n} = 0 :

mnnm = mm =  + = 0
this relation is then generalized to the graded quantum mechanical commutator or
poisson bracket by

[m , n} = hm n ,

m n p n = m
p

where  is constant, hermitian, and graded antisymmetric:

(m n ] = 0 :

(mn) = [] = m + m = 0

where [] is the dierence of the two orderings, as above, while () is the sum. for
the standard normalization of canonically conjugate pairs of bosons

m = i = (qi, pi)

and self-conjugate fermions, we choose

 = ;

i,j = ijc ,

c  =(cid:0) 0

i

i

0(cid:1)

because of signs resulting from ordering anticommuting quantities, we dene

derivatives unambiguously by their action from the left:

the general poisson bracket then can be written as


m n = n

m

semiclassically

[a, b}  a




m n m 

n b

since derivatives are normally dened to act from the left, there is a minus sign from
pushing the rst derivative to the left if a and that particular component of /m
are both fermionic.

a. coordinates

47

exercise ia2.3

lets examine some properties of fermionic oscillators:

a for a single set of harmonic oscillators we have

{a, a} = {a, a} = 0
show that the number operator aa has the property

{a, a} = 1,

{a, eiaa} = 0

(hint: since this system has only 2 states, the easiest way is to check the
action on those states.)

b dene eigenstates of the annihilation operator (coherent states) by

where  is anticommuting. show that this implies

a|i = |i

xaa|i = |xi,

a|i = 


 |i,

|i = ea

h|i = e* 

,

|0i,

e a

|i = | + i,
1 =z d*d e*|ih|

dene wave functions in this space,  () = h|i. taylor expand them in ,
and compare this to the usual two-component representation using |0i and
a|0i as a basis.

c dene the supertrace by

str(a) =z d*d e*h|a|i

find the relation between any operator in this space and a 22 matrix, and
nd the expression for the supertrace in terms of this matrix.

d for two sets of fermionic oscillators, we dene

{a1, a1} = {a2, a2} = 1,

other { , } = 0

show that the new operators

a1 = a1,

a2 = eia

1a1a2

(and their hermitian conjugates) are equivalent to the original ones except
that one set of the new oscillators commutes (not anticommutes) with the

48

i. global

other ([a1, a2] = 0, etc.), even though each set satises the same anticom-
mutation relations with itself ({a1, a1} = 1, etc.). thus, choice of statistics
is relevant only for particles in the same state: at most one fermion, but
unlimited bosons. (this change of oscillator basis is called a klein trans-
formation. it can be useful for discrete sets of oscillators, but not for those
labeled by a continuous parameter, because of the discontinuity in the com-
mutation relations when the two labels are equal.)

exercise ia2.4

repeat exercise ia2.3 for the bosonic oscillator ([a, a] = 1), where the hilbert
space is innite-dimensional, paying attention to signs, interchanging commu-
tators with anticommutators where necessary, etc. show that the analog of
part c denes the ordinary trace.

3. lie algebra

since the same symmetries can be expressed in terms of dierent kinds of brackets
for classical and quantum theories, it can be useful to work with just those properties
that the poisson bracket and commutator have in common, i.e., those that involve
only the bracket of two operators, not just their ordinary product:

[a + b, c] = [a, c] + [b, c]

for numbers , 

(distributivity)

[a, b] = [b, a]

(antisymmetry)

[a, [b, c]] + [b, [c, a]] + [c, [a, b]] = 0

(jacobi identity)

with similar expressions (diering only by signs) for anticommutators or mixed com-
mutators and anticommutators.

exercise ia3.1

find the generalizations of the jacobi identity using also anticommutators,
corresponding to the cases where 2 or 3 of the objects involved are considered
as fermionic instead of bosonic.

these properties also give an abstract denition of a form of multiplication, the
lie bracket, which denes a lie algebra. (the rst property is true of algebras
in general.) other lie brackets include those dened by another, associative, form of
multiplication, such as matrix multiplication, or operator (innite matrix) multipli-
cation as in quantum mechanics: in those cases we can write [a, b] = ab  ba, and
use the usual properties of multiplication (distributivity and associativity) to derive
the properties of the lie bracket. (another familiar example in physics is the cross

a. coordinates

49

product for three-vectors; however, this can also be expressed in terms of matrix
multiplication.) the most important use of lie algebras for physics is for describing
(continuous) innitesimal transformations, especially those describing symmetries.

exercise ia3.2

using only the commutation relations of the generators of the galilean group
(exercise ia1.1), check all the jacobi identities.

for describing transformations, we can also think of the bracket as a derivative:

the lie derivative of b with respect to a is dened as

lab = [a, b]

as a consequence of the properties of the lie bracket, this derivative satises the
usual properties of a derivative, including the leibniz rule. (in fact, for coordinate
transformations the lie derivative is really a derivative with respect to the coordi-
nates.)

we can now dene nite transformations by exponentiating innitesimal ones:

a  (1 + ilg)a  a = lim
0

(1 + ilg)1/a = eilga

in cases where we have [a, b] = ab  ba, we can also write

eilga = eigaeig

this follows from replacing g on both sides with g and taking the derivative with
respect to , to see that both satisfy the same dierential equation with the same
initial condition. we then can recognize this as the way transformations are performed
in quantum mechanics: a linear transformation that preserves the hilbert-space inner
product must be unitary, which means it can be written as the exponential of an
antihermitian operator.

just as innitesimal transformations dene a lie algebra with elements a, nite

ones dene a lie group with elements

g = eig

the multiplication law of two group elements follows from the fact the product of
two exponentials can be expressed in terms of multiple commutators:

eaeb = ea+b+

1
2 [a,b]+...

we now have the mathematical properties that dene a group, namely:

50

i. global

(1) a product, so that for two group elements g1 and g2, we can dene g1g2, which is

another element of the group (closure),

(2) an identity element, so gi = ig = g,

(3) an inverse, where gg1 = g1g = i, and

(4) associativity, g1(g2g3) = (g1g2)g3.

in this case the identity is 1 = e0, while the inverse is (ea)1 = ea.

since the elements of a lie algebra form a vector space (we can add them and

multiply by numbers), its useful to dene a basis:

g = igi  g = eiigi

the parameters i then also give a set of (redundant) coordinates for the lie group.
(previously they were required to be innitesimal, for innitesimal transformations;
now they are nite, but may be periodic, as determined by topological considerations
that we will mostly ignore.) now the multiplication rules for both the algebra and
the group are given by those of the basis:

for the (structure) constants fij
ambiguous up to a change of basis). they satisfy the jacobi identity

k, which dene the algebra/group (but are

a familiar example is so(3) (su(2)), 3d rotations, where fij

k = ijk if we use gi =

another useful concept is a subgroup: if some subset of the elements of a group
also form a group, that is called a subgroup of the original group. in particular, for
a lie group the basis of that subgroup will be a subset of some basis for the original
group. for example, for the galilean group jij generate the rotation subgroup.

exercise ia3.3

lets examine the subgroup of the galilean group describing (spatial) coor-
dinate transformations  rotations and spatial translations:

a show that the innitesimal transformations are given by

xi = xjj

i + i,

ij = ji

where the s are constants.

b exponentiate to nd the nite transformations

c show that i

lkl = ij

both to preserve the scalar product, and as a consequence of exponentiating.
(hint: use matrix notation, and nd the equivalent relation between  and
1.)

d show that the last equation implies det  = 1, while exponentiating can
give only det  = 1 (since +1 cant change continuously to 1). what is the
physical interpretation of a transformation with det  = 1? (hint: consider
a simple example.)

these results can be generalized to include anticommutators: when some of the
basis elements gi are fermionic, the corresponding parameters i are anticommuting
numbers, the structure constants are dened by [gi, gj}, etc.. then g = igi is
bosonic term by term, as is g, so bosons transform into bosons and fermions into
fermions, but taylor expansion in the s will have both bosonic and fermionic co-
ecients. (for example, for a = b, if a is bosonic, then so is b, but if also  is
fermionic, then b will also be fermionic.)

for some purposes it is more convenient to absorb the i in the innitesimal

transformation into the denition of the generator:

g  ig  a = [g, a] = lga,

g = eg,

[gi, gj] = fij

kgk

this aects the reality properties of g: in particular, if g is unitary (gg = i), as
usually required in quantum mechanics, g = eig makes g hermitian (g = g), while
g = eg makes g antihermitian (g = g). in some cases anithermiticity can be
an advantage: for example, for translations we would then have pi = i and for
rotations jij = x[ij], which is more convenient since we know the is in these (and
any) coordinate transformations must cancel anyway. on the other hand, the u(1)
transformations of electrodynamics (on the wave function for a charged particle) are
just phase transformations g = ei (where  is a real number), so clearly we want the
explicit i; then the only generator has the representation gi = 1. in general well nd
that for our purposes absorbing the is into the generators is more convenient for just
spacetime symmetries, while explicit is are more convenient for internal symmetries.

4. relativity

the hamiltonian approach singles out the time coordinate. in relativistic theories
time can be treated on equal footing with space, and it is useful to take advantage of
this fact, so that the full poincare invariance is manifest. so, we treat the time t and
spatial position xi together as a four-vector (or d-vector in d1 space and 1 time
dimension)

xm = (x0, xi) = (t, xi)

where m = 0, 1, ..., 3 (or d1), i = 1, 2, 3. since the energy e and three-momentum
pi are canonically conjugate to them,

[pi, xj] = iij,

[e, t] = +i

we dene the 4-momentum as

pm = (e, pi) = mnpn,

[pm, xn] = in
where we raise and lower indices with the minkowski metric, in an orthonormal
basis,

[pm, xn] = imn,

pm = mnpn;

 p0 = p0 = e

in four spacetime dimensions, with obvious generalizations to higher dimensions.
(sometimes the metric with signs +   is used; we prefer  + ++ because it
is more convenient for quantum calculations. the numbers of positive and negative
eigenvalues of an invertible matrix is known as its signature.) therefore, we now
distinguish upper and lower indices in general: at least for position and momentum,
the upper-indexed xm and pm have the usual physical interpretation (so xm and pm
have extra signs). this is consistent with our previous nonrelativistic notation, since
3-vector indices do not change sign upon raising or lowering.

of course, we could have done that much nonrelativistically. relativity is a
in particular, a free, spinless, relativistic

symmetry of kinematics and dynamics:
particle is completely described by the constraint

where we dene the covariant square

p2 + m2 = 0

p2 = pmpm = pmpnmn = (p0)2 + (p1)2 + (p2)2 + (p3)2

a. coordinates

53

(the square of p on the left should not be confused with the second component of p
on the right.) our relativistic symmetry must leave this constraint invariant: thus
the metric denes the norm of a vector (and an invariant inner product). therefore,
to preserve lorentz invariance it is important that we contract only an upper index
with a lower index. for similar reasons, we have

m =


xm ,

mxn = n
m

so quantum mechanically pm = im.

unlike the positive-denite nonrelativistic norm of a 3-vector v i, for an arbitrary

4-vector v m we can have

<
=
>

v 2



0 : 

timelike
lightlike/null
spacelike

in particular, the 4-momentum is timelike for massive particles (m2 > 0) and lightlike
for massless ones (while tachyons, with spacelike momenta and m2 < 0, do not exist,
for reasons that are most clear from quantum eld theory).

the quantum mechanics will be described later, but the result is that this con-
straint can be used as the wave equation. the main qualitative distinction from the
nonrelativistic case in the constraint

nonrelativistic :  2me + ~p 2 = 0

relativistic :  e2 + m2 + ~p 2 = 0

is that the equation for the energy e  p0 is now quadratic, and thus has two
solutions:

p0 = ,

 =p(pi)2 + m2

later well see how the second solution is interpreted as an antiparticle. we also
use (natural/planck) units c = 1, so length and duration are measured in the same
units; c then appears only as a parameter for dening nonrelativistic expansions and
limits.

the translations and lorentz transformations make up the poincare group, the
symmetry that denes special relativity. (the lorentz group in d1 space and 1
time dimension is the orthogonal group o(d1,1). the proper lorentz group
so(d1,1), where the s is for special, transforms the coordinates by a matrix
whose determinant is 1. the poincare group is iso(d1,1), where the i stands

54

i. global

for inhomogeneous.) for the spinless particle they are generated by coordinate
transformations gi = (pa, jab):

pa = pa,

jab = x[apb]

(where also a, b = 0, ..., 3). then the fact that the physics of the free particle is
invariant under poincare transformations is expressed as

[pa, p2 + m2] = [jab, p2 + m2] = 0

writing an arbitrary innitesimal transformation as a linear combination of the gen-
erators, we nd

xm = xnn

m + m,

mn = nm

where the s are constants. note that antisymmetry of mn does not imply antisym-
n = mppn, because of additional signs. (similar remarks apply to jab.)
metry of m
exponentiating to nd the nite transformations, we have

xm = xnn

the same lorentz transformations apply to pm, but the translations do not aect
it. the condition on  follows from preservation of the minkowski norm (or inner
n by exponentiating  = e
product), but it is equivalent to the antisymmetry of m
(compare exercise ia3.3).

since dxapa is invariant under the coordinate transformations dened by the pois-
son bracket (the chain rule, since eectively pa  a), it follows that the poincare
invariance of p2 is equivalent to the invariance of the line element

ds2 = dxmdxnmn

which denes the proper time s. spacetime with this indenite metric is called
minkowski space, in contrast to the euclidean space with positive denite metric
used to describe nonrelativistic length measured in just the three spatial dimensions.
(the signature of the metric is thus the numbers of space and time dimensions.)

for the massive case, we also have

pa = m

dxa

for the massless case ds = 0: massless particles travel along lightlike lines. however,
we can dene a new parameter  such that

pa =

dxa
d

is well-dened in the massless case. in general, we then have

s = m

while this xes  = s/m in the massive case, in the massless case it instead restricts
s = 0. thus, proper time does not provide a useful parametrization of the world
line of a classical massless particle, while  does: for any piece of such a line, d is
given in terms of (any component of) pa and dxa. later well see how this parameter
appears in relativistic classical mechanics, and is useful for quantum mechanics and
eld theory.

starting from the usual lorentz force law for a massive particle in terms of
proper time s (which doesnt apply to m = 0), rewrite it in terms of  to nd
a form which can apply to m = 0.

exercise ia4.3

the relation between x and p is closely related to the poincare conservation
laws:

a show that

dpa = djab = 0  p[adxb] = 0

and use this to prove that conservation of p and j imply the existence of a
parameter  such that pa = dxa/d .

particles can interact only when at the same point (i.e., by collision; they

where  refers to the change from before to after the collision(s).

special relativity can also be stated as the fact that the only physically observ-
able quantities are those that are poincare invariant. (other objects, such as vectors,
depend on the choice of reference frame.) for example, consider two spinless par-
ticles that interact by collision, producing two spinless particles (which may dier
from the originals). consider just the momenta. (quantum mechanically, this is a
complete description.) all invariants can be expressed in terms of the masses and the
mandelstam variables (not to be confused with time and proper time)

s = (p1 + p2)2,

t = (p1  p3)2,

u = (p1  p4)2

where we have used momentum conservation, which shows that even these three
quantities are not independent:

(the explicit index now labels the particle, for the process 1+23+4.) the simplest
reference frame to describe this interaction is the center-of-mass frame (actually the
center of momentum, where the two 3-momenta cancel). in that lorentz frame, using
also rotational invariance, momentum conservation, and the mass-shell conditions, the
momenta can be written in terms of these invariants as

p1 = 1s ( 1

5. discrete: c, p, t

by considering only symmetries than can be obtained continuously from the iden-
tity (lie groups), we have missed some important symmetries: those that reect some
of the coordinates. its sucient to consider a single reection of a spacelike axis,
and one of a timelike axis; all other reections can be obtained by combining these
with the continuous (proper, orthochronous) lorentz transformations. (spacelike
and timelike vectors cant be lorentz transformed into each other, and reection of
a lightlike axis wont preserve p2 + m2.) also, the reection of one spatial axis can
be combined with a  rotation about that axis, resulting in reection of all three
spatial coordinates. (similar generalizations hold for higher dimensions. note that
the product of an even number of reections about dierent axes is a proper rotation;
thus, for even numbers of spatial dimensions reections of all spatial coordinates are
proper rotations, even though the reection of a single axis is not.) the reversal of the
spatial coordinates is called parity (p), while that of the time coordinate is called
time reversal (t; actually, for historical reasons, to be explained shortly, this is
usually labeled ct.) these transformations have the same eect on the momen-
tum, so that the denition of the poisson bracket is also preserved. these discrete
transformations, unlike the proper ones, are not symmetries of nature (except in cer-
tain approximations): the only exception is the transformation that reects all axes
(cpt).

while the metric mn is invariant under all lorentz transformations (by deni-

tion), the levi-civita tensor

mnpq totally antisymmetric,

0123 = 0123 = 1

is invariant under only proper lorentz transformations: it has an odd number of
space indices and of time indices, so it changes sign under parity or time reversal.
(more precisely, under p or t the levi-civita tensor does not suer the expected
sign change, since its constant, so there is an extra sign compared to the one
expected for a tensor.) consequently, we can use it to dene pseudotensors: given
polar vectors, whose signs change as position or momentum under improper lorentz
transformations, and scalars, which are invariant, we can dene axial vectors and
pseudoscalars as

va = abcdbbc cdd,

 = abcdaabbc cdd

which get an extra sign change under such transformations (p or ct, but not cpt).

a. coordinates

59

there is another such discrete transformation that is dened on phase space,
but which does not aect spacetime. it changes the sign of all components of the
momentum, while leaving the spacetime coordinates unchanged. this transformation
is called charge conjugation (c), and is also only an approximate symmetry in
nature.
(quantum mechanically, complex conjugation of the position-space wave
function changes the sign of the momentum.) furthermore, it does not preserve the
poisson bracket, but changes it by an overall sign. (the misnomer ct for time
reversal follows historically from the fact that the combination of reversing the time
axis and charge conjugation preserves the sign of the energy.) the physical meaning
of this transformation is clear from the spacetime-momentum relation of relativistic
classical mechanics p = m dx/ds: it is proper-time reversal, changing the sign of s.
the relation to charge follows from minimal coupling: the covariant momentum
m dx/ds = p + qa (for charge q) appears in the constraint (p + qa)2 + m2 = 0 in an
electromagnetic background; p  p then has the same eect as q  q.

in the previous subsection, we mentioned how negative energies were associated
with antiparticles. now we can better see the relation in terms of charge conjuga-
tion. note that charge conjugation, since it only changes the sign of  but does not
eect the coordinates, does not change the path of the particle, but only how it is
parametrized. this is also true in terms of momentum, since the velocity is given by
pi/p0. thus, the only observable property that is changed is charge; spacetime prop-
erties (path, velocity, mass; also spin, as well see later) remain the same. another
way to say this is that charge conjugation commutes with the poincare group. one
way to identify an antiparticle is that it has all the same kinematical properties (mass,
spin) as the corresponding particle, but opposite sign for internal quantum numbers
(like charge). (another way is pair creation and annihilation: see subsection iiib5
below.)

all these transformations are summarized in the table:

c ct p t cp p t cp t

s  + +   
t +  +  + 
~x + +  +  
e   + +  +
~p  +   + +

+





(the upper-left 33 matrix contains the denitions, the rest is implied.) in terms
of complex wave functions, we see that c is just complex conjugation (no eect on

60

i. global

coordinates, but momentum and energy change sign because of the i in the fourier
transform). on the other hand, for ct and p there is no complex conjugation, but
changes in sign of the coordinates that are arguments of the wave functions, and
also on the corresponding indices  the orbital and spin parts of these discrete
transformations. (for example, derivatives a have sign changes because xa does, so
a vector wave function a must have the same sign changes on its indices for aa to
transform as a scalar.) the other transformations follow as products of these.

exercise ia5.1

find the eect of each of these 7 transformations on wave functions that are:
a scalars, b pseudoscalars, c vectors, d axial vectors.

however, from the point of view of the particle there is some kind of kinematic
change, since the proper time has changed sign: if we think of the mechanics of a
particle as a one-dimensional theory in  space (the worldline), where x( ) (as well
as any such variables describing spin or internal symmetry) is a wave function or eld
on that space, then    is t on that one-dimensional space. (the fact we dont
get ct can be seen when we add additional variables: for example, if we describe
internal u(n) symmetry in terms of creation and annihilation operators ai and ai,
then c mixes them on both the worldline and spacetime. so, on the worldline we
have the pure worldline geometric symmetry ct times c = t.) thus, in terms of
zeroth quantization,

worldline t  spacetime c

on the other hand, spacetime p and ct are simply internal symmetries with respect
to the worldline (as are proper, orthochronous poincare transformations).

quantum mechanically, there is a good reason for particles of negative energy:
they appear in complex-conjugate wave functions, since (eit)* = e+it. since we
always evaluate expressions of the form hf|ii, it is natural for energies of both signs
to appear.

in classical eld theory, we can identify a particle with its antiparticle by requiring
the eld to be invariant under charge conjugation: for example, for a scalar eld
(spinless particle), we have the reality condition

(x) = *(x)

or in momentum space, by fourier transformation,
(p) = [ (p)]*
which implies the particle has charge zero (neutral).

6. conformal

poincare transformations are the most general coordinate transformations that
preserve the mass condition p2 + m2 = 0, but there is a larger group, the confor-
mal group, that preserves this constraint in the massless case. although conformal

symmetry is not observed in nature, it is important in all approaches to eld theory:

(1) first of all, it is useful in the construction of free theories (see subsections iib1-4

below). all massive elds can be described consistently in quantum eld theory

in terms of coupling massless elds. massless theories are a subset of conformal

theories, and some conditions on massless theories can be found more easily by

nding the appropriate subset of those on conformal theories. this is related to

the fact that the conformal group, unlike the poincare group, is simple: it has

no nontrivial subgroup that transforms into itself under the rest of the group (like

the way translations transform into themselves under lorentz transformations).

(2) in interacting theories at the classical level, conformal symmetry is also impor-

tant in nding and classifying solutions, since at least some parts of the action are

conformally invariant, so corresponding solutions are related by conformal trans-

formations (see subsections iiic5-7). furthermore, it is often convenient to treat

arbitrary theories as broken conformal theories, introducing elds with which

the breaking is associated, and analyze the conformal and conformal-breaking

elds separately. this is particularly true for the case of gravity (see subsections

ixa7,b5,c2-3,xa3-4,b5-7).

(3) within quantum eld theory at the perturbative level, the only physical quantum

eld theories are ones that are conformal at high energies (see subsection viiic1).

the quantum corrections to conformal invariance at high energy are relatively

simple.

(4) beyond perturbation theory, the only quantum theories that are well dened may

be just the ones whose breaking of conformal invariance at low energy is only

classical (see subsections viic2-3,viiia5-6). furthermore, the largest possible

symmetry of a nontrivial s-matrix is conformal symmetry (or superconformal

symmetry if we include fermionic generators).

(5) self-duality (a generalization of a condition that equates electric and magnetic

elds) is useful for nding solutions to classical eld equations as well as sim-

plifying perturbation theory, and is closely related to twistors (see subsections

iib6-7,c5,iiic4-7). in general, self-duality is related to conformal invariance: for

62

i. global

example, it can be shown that the free conformal theories in arbitrary even di-
mensions are just those with (on-mass-shell) eld strengths on which self-duality
can be imposed. (in arbitrary odd dimensions the free conformal theories are just
the scalar and spinor.)

transformations  that satisfy

[a(x)pa, p2] = (x)p2

for some  also preserve p2 = 0, although they dont leave p2 invariant. equivalently,
we can look for coordinate transformations that scale

dx2 = (x)dx2

exercise ia6.1

find the conformal group explicitly in two dimensions, and show its innite
dimensional (not just the so(2,2) described below).
(hint: use lightcone
coordinates.)

this symmetry can be made manifest by starting with a space with one extra

space and time dimension:

ya = (ya, y+, y)  y2 = yaybab = (ya)2  2y+y

where (ya)2 = yaybab uses the usual d-dimensional minkowski-space metric ab,
and the two additional dimensions have been written in a lightcone basis (not to
be confused for the similar basis that can be used for the minkowski metric itself).
with respect to this metric, the original so(d1,1) lorentz symmetry has been
enlarged to so(d,2). this is the conformal group in d dimensions. however, rather
than also preserving (d+2)-dimensional translation invariance, we instead impose the
constraint and invariance

y2 = 0,

ya = (y)ya

this reduces the original space to the projective (invariant under the  scaling)
lightcone (which in this case really is a cone).

these two conditions can be solved by

ya = ewa, wa = (xa, 1, 1

2xaxa)

projective invariance then means independence from e (y+), while the lightcone con-
dition has determined y. y2 = 0 implies y  dy = 0, so the simplest conformal
invariant is

dy2 = (edw + wde)2 = e2dw2 = e2dx2

a. coordinates

63

where we have used w2 = 0  w  dw = 0. this means any so(d,2) transformation
on ya will simply scale dx2, and scale e2 in the opposite way:

dx2 =(cid:18) e2

e2(cid:19) dx2

in agreement with the previous denition of the conformal group.

the explicit form of conformal transformations on xa = ya/y+ now follows from

their linear form on ya, using the generators

gab = y[arb],

[ra, yb] = ib

a

of so(d,2) in terms of the momentum ra conjugate to ya. (these are dened the
same way as the lorentz generators j ab = x[apb].) for example, g+ just scales xa.
(scale transformations are also known as dilatations.) we can also recognize g+a as
generating translations on xa. the only complicated transformations are generated
by ga, known as conformal boosts (acceleration transformations). since they
commute with each other (like translations), its easy to exponentiate to nd the

nite transformations:

y = egy,

g = vay[a]

for some constant d-vector va (where a  /ya). since the conformal boosts act
as lowering operators for scale weight (+  a  ), only the rst three terms in
the exponential survive:

gy = 0,

is more than one time dimension, any time reversal can be obtained from
another (but time reversal cant be rotated into parity, since a timelike vector
cant be rotated into a spacelike one). thus, the complete orthogonal group
o(m,n) can be obtained from those transformations that are continuous from
the identity by combining them with 1 parity transformation and 1 time
reversal transformation (for mn6=0).

in the previous section we saw various spacetime groups (galilean, poincare,

conformal) in terms of how they acted on coordinates. this not only gave them a

simple physical interpretation, but also allowed a direct relation between classical

and quantum theories. however, as we know from studying rotations in quantum

theory in terms of spin, we will often need to study symmetries of quantum theories

for which the classical analog is not so useful or perhaps even nonexistent.

we therefore now consider some general results of group theory, mostly for con-

tinuous groups. we use tensor methods, rather than the slightly more powerful but

greatly less convenient cartan-weyl-dynkin methods. much of this section should

be review, but is included here for completeness; it is not intended as a substitute for

a group theory course, but as a summary of those results commonly useful in eld

theory.

1. matrices

matrices are dened by the way they act on some vector space; an nn matrix
takes one n-component vector to another. given some group, and its multiplication

table (which denes the group completely), there is more than one way to represent

it by matrices. any set of matrices we nd that has the same multiplication table as

the group elements is called a representation of that group, and the vector space on

which those matrices act is called the representation space. the representation of

the algebra or group in terms of explicit matrices is given by choosing a basis for the

vector space. if we include innite-dimensional representations, then a representation
of a group is simply a way to write its transformations that is linear:  = m is
linear in . more generally, we can also have a realization of a group, where the

transformations can be nonlinear. these tend to be more cumbersome, so we usually

try to make redenitions of the variables that make the realization linear. a precise

denition of manifest symmetry is that all the realizations used are linear. (one
possible exception is ane or inhomogeneous transformations  = m1 + m2,
such as the usual coordinate representation of poincare transformations, since these

transformations are still very simple, because they are really still linear, though not

homogeneous.)

group element is thus (m, v ).

b find the innitesimal form of this transformation. dene the n2+n generators

c find the commutation relations of these generators.

for convenience, we write matrices with a hilbert-space-like notation, but unlike
hilbert space we dont necessarily associate bras directly with kets by hermitian
conjugation, or even transposition. in general, the two spaces can even be dierent
sizes, to describe matrices that are not square; however, for group theory we are
interested only in matrices that take us from some vector space into itself, so they
are square. bras have an inner product with kets, but neither necessarily has a norm
(inner product with itself): in general, if we start with some vector space, written
as kets, we can always dene the dual space, written as bras, by dening such an
inner product.
in our case, we may start with some representation of a group, in
terms of some vector space, and that will give us directly the dual representation. (if
the representation is in terms of unitary matrices, we have a hilbert space, and the
dual representation is just the complex conjugate.)

so, we dene column vectors |i with a basis |ii, and row vectors h| with a
basis hi|, where i = 1, ...,n to describe nn matrices. the two bases have a relative
normalization dened so that the inner product gives the usual component sum:

|i = |iii, h| = ihi|;
these bases then dene not only the components of vectors, but also matrices:

i  h|i = ii ;

hi|ji = j

hi|i = i , h|ii = i

m = |iimi

jhj|,

hi|m|ji = mi

j

68

i. global

j labels the row of the
where as usual the i on the component (matrix element) mi
matrix m, and j the column. this implies the usual matrix multiplication rules,
inserting the identity in terms of the basis,

i = |kihk|  (mn)i

j = hi|m|kihk|n|ji = mi

knk

j

closely related is the denition of the trace,

tr m = hi|m|ii = mi
(well discuss the determinant later.)

i  tr(mn) = tr(nm)

the bra-ket notation is really just matrix notation written in a way to clearly
distinguish column vectors, row vectors, and matrices. we can, of course, also use
the usual pictorial notation

this is useful only when listing individual components.

we can easily translate transformation laws from matrix notation into index no-
tation just by using a basis for the representation space. we now write g and g to
refer to either matrix representations of the group and algebra elements, or to the
abstract elements:
i.e., either to a specic representation, or the most general one.
again writing g = eig,

g|ii = |jigj

i, g|ii = |jigj

i

g = igi,

|i = ig|i = |iiii(gi)i

j j  i = ii(gi)i

j j

the dual space isnt needed for this purpose. however, for any representation of a
group, the transpose

(m t )i

j = mj

i

of the inverse of those matrices also gives a representation of the group, since

g1g2 = g3  (g1)t1(g2)t1 = (g3)t1

b. indices

69

[g1, g2] = g3  [gt

3

1 ,gt

2 ] = gt

this is the dual representation, which follows from dening the above inner product
to be invariant under the group:

h|i = 0  i = ij i(gi)j

i

the complex conjugate of a complex representation is also a representation, since

g1g2 = g3  g1*g2* = g3*

[g1, g2] = g3  [g1*, g2*] = g3*

from any given representation, we can thus nd three others from taking the dual
and the conjugate: in matrix and index notation,

 = g :
 = (g1)t  :
 = g* :

since (g1)t , g*, and (g1) (but not gt , etc.) satisfy the same multiplication algebra
as g, including ordering. we use up/down and dotted/undotted indices to denote
the transformation law of each type of index; contracting undotted up indices with
undotted down indices preserves the transformation law as indicated by the remaining
indices, and similarly for dotted indices. these four representations are not necessarily
independent: imposing relations among them is how the classical groups are dened
(see subsections ib4-5 below).

2. representations

for example, we always have the adjoint representation of a lie group/algebra,

which is how the algebra acts on its own generators:

(1) adjoint as operator: g = igi, a = igi  a = i[g, a] = jifij

kgk

 i = ikj(gj)k

i,

(gi)j

k = ifij

k

this gives us two ways to represent the adjoint representation space: as either the
usual vector space, or in terms of the generators. thus, we either use the matrix

70

i. global

a = igi (for arbitrary representation of the matrices gi, or treating gi as just
abstract generators), or we can write a as a row vector:

(2) adjoint as vector:

ha| = ihi|  ha| = iha|g

 ihi| = ikj(gj)k

ihi|

the adjoint representation also provides a convenient way to dene a (symmetric)

group metric invariant under the group, the cartan metric:

ij = tra(gigj) = fik

k

lfjl

(tra refers to the trace taken with respect to the representation a; equivalently, we
could take the gs inside the trace to be in the a representation.) for abelian
groups the structure constants vanish, and thus so does this metric. semisimple
groups are those where the metric is invertible (no vanishing eigenvalues). a simple
group has no nontrivial subgroup that transforms into itself under the rest of the
group: semisimple groups can be written as products of simple groups. compact
groups are those where it is positive denite (all eigenvalues positive); they are also
those for which the invariant volume of the group space is nite. for simple, compact
groups its convenient to choose a basis where

ij = caij

for some constant ca (the dynkin index for the adjoint representation). for some
general irreducible representation r of such a group the normalization of the trace is

trr(gigj) = crij =

cr
ca

ij

now the proportionality constant cr/ca is xed by the choice of r (only), since we
have already xed the normalization of our basis.

exercise ib2.1

what is cr for an abelian group? (hint: not just 1.)

in general, the cyclicity property of the trace implies, for any representation, that

0 = tr([gi, gj]) = ifij

ktr(gk)

so tr(gi) = 0 for semisimple groups. similarly, we nd

fijk  fij

llk = i tra([gi, gj]gk)

b. indices

71

is totally antisymmetric: for semisimple groups, this implies the total antisymmetry
k, up to factors (which are absent for compact groups in
of the structure constants fij
a basis where ij  ij). this also means the adjoint representation is its own dual.
(for example, for the compact group so(3), we have ij = ikljlk = 2ij.) thus,
we can write a in a third way, as a column vector

(3) adjoint as dual vector:

|ai = |iii  |iijji  |ai = ig|ai

we can also do this for abelian groups, by dening an invertible metric unrelated to
the cartan metric: this is trivial for abelian groups, since the generators themselves
are invariant, and thus so is any metric on them.

an identity related to the trace one is the normalization of the value kr of the

casimir operator for any particular representation,

ijgigj = kri

its proportionality to the identity follows from the fact that it commutes with each
generator:

[jkgjgk, gi] = if j

i

k{gj, gk} = 0

using the antisymmetry of the structure constants. (thus it takes the same value on
any component of an irreducible representation, since they are all related by group
transformations.) by tracing this identity, and contracting the trace identity,

cr
ca

da = trr(ijgigj) = krdr

 kr =

crda
cadr

where dr  trr(i) is the dimension of that representation.

although quantum mechanics is dened on hilbert space, which is a kind of com-
plex vector space, more generally we want to consider real objects, like spacetime
vectors. this restricts the form of linear transformations: specically, if we absorb
is as g = eg, then in such representations g itself must be real. these represen-
tations are then called real representations, while a complex representation is
one whose representation isnt real in any basis. a complex representation space can
have a real representation, but a real representation space cant have a complex rep-
resentation. in particular, coordinate transformations (of real coordinates) have only
real representations, which is why absorbing the is into the generators is a useful
convention there. for semisimple unitary groups, hermiticity of the generators of the
adjoint representation implies (using total antisymmetry of the structure constants

72

i. global

and reality of the cartan metric) that the structure constants are real, and thus the
adjoint representation is a real representation. more generally, any real unitary rep-
resentation will have antisymmetric generators (g = g* = g  g = gt ). if
the complex conjugate representation is the same as the original (same matrices up
to a similarity transformation g* = mgm1), but the representation is not real, then
it is called pseudoreal. (an example is the spinor of su(2), to be described in the
next section.)

0

for any representation g of the group, a transformation g  g0gg1

on every
group element g for some particular group element g0 clearly maps the algebra to
itself, and preserves the multiplication rules. (similar remarks apply to applying the
transformation to the generators.) however, the same is true for complex conjugation,
g  g*: not only are the multiplication rules preserved, but for any element g
(this can be shown,
of that representation of the group, g* is also an element.
e.g., by dening representations in terms of the values of all the casimir operators,
contructed from various powers of the generators.) in quantum mechanics (where
the representations are unitary), the latter is called an antiunitary transformation.
although this is a symmetry of the group, it cannot be reproduced by a unitary
transformation, except when the representation is (pseudo)real.

exercise ib2.2

show how this works for the abelian group u(1). explain this antiunitary
transformation in terms of two-dimensional rotations o(2).
(u(1)=so(2),
the proper rotations obtained continuously from the identity.)

a very simple way to build a representation from others is by direct sum. if we
have two representations of a group, on two dierent spaces, then we can take their
direct sum by just putting one column vector on top of the other, creating a bigger
vector whose size (dimension) is the sum of that of the original two. explicitly, if
we start with the basis |i for the rst representation and |i for the second, then
the union (|i,|i) is the basis for the direct sum. (we can also write |ii = (|i,|i),
where  = 1, ..., m;  = 1, ..., n; i = 1, ..., m, m + 1, ..., m + n.) the group then acts
on each part of the new vector in the obvious way:

 = |i,  = |i;
g|i = |ig
 |i = |i  |i = |i  |i

,

or

g|i = |ig

73

(we can replace the  with an ordinary + if we understand the basis vectors to be
now in a bigger space, where the elements of the rst basis have zeros for the new
components on the bottom while those of the second have zeros for the new compo-
nents on top.) the important point is that no group element mixes the two spaces:
the group representation is block diagonal. any representation that can be written
as a direct sum (after an appropriate choice of basis) is called reducible. for exam-
ple, we can build a reducible real representation from an irreducible complex one by
just taking the direct sum of this complex representation with the complex conjugate
representation. similarly, we can take direct sums of more than two representations.

a more useful way to build representations is by direct product. the idea there
is to take a colummn vector and a row vector and use them to construct a matrix,
where the group element acts simultaneously on rows according to one representation
and columns according to the other. if the two original bases are again |i and |i,
the new basis can also be written as |ii = |i (i = 1, ..., mn). explicitly,

a familar example from quantum mechanics is rotations (or lorentz transformations),
where the rst space is position space (so  is the continuous index x), acted on by
the orbital part of the generators, while the second space is nite-dimensional, and is
acted on by the spin part of the generators. direct product representations are usually
reducible: they then can be written also as direct sums, in a way that depends on
the particulars of the group and the representations.

consider a representation constructed by direct product: in matrix notation

gi = gi  i + i  gi

using tr(a  b) = tr(a)tr(b), and assuming tr(gi) = tr(gi) = 0, we have

tr( gi gj) = tr(i)tr(gigj) + tr(i)tr(gigj)

for example, for su(n) (see subsection ib4 below) we can construct the adjoint rep-
resentation from the direct product of the n-dimensional, dening representation
and its complex conjugate. (we also get a singlet, but it will not aect the result for
the adjoint.) in that case we nd

tra(gigj) = 2n trd(gigj) 

cd

=

for most purposes, we use trd(gigj) = ij (cd = 1) for su(n), so ca = 2n.

3. determinants

we now review some properties of determinants that will prove useful for the
group analysis of the following subsections. determinants can be dened in terms of
the levi-civita tensor . as a consequence of its antisymmetry,

 totally antisymmetric,

12...n = 12...n = 1  j1...jni1...in = i1

[j1    in

jn]

since each possible numerical index value appears once in each , so they can be
matched up with s. by similar reasoning,

1

m! k1...kmj1...jnmk1...kmi1...inm = i1

[j1    inm

jnm]

where the normalization compensates for the number of terms in the summation.

c find the cartan metric, and thus the value of ca.

this tensor is used to dene the determinant:

det mi

j = 1

n!j1...jni1...inmi1

j1    min

jn  j1...jnmi1

j1    min

jn = i1...indet m

since anything totally antisymmetric in n indices must be proportional to the  tensor.

this yields an explicit expression for the inverse:

(m1)j1

i1 = 1

(n1)! j1...jni1...inmi2

j2    min

jn(det m)1

from this follows a useful expression for the variation of the determinant:

which is equivalent to


mi

j det m = (m1)j

i det m

 ln det m = tr(m1m)

replacing m with em gives the often-used identity

 ln det em = tr(em em ) = tr m  det em = etr m

b. indices

75

where we have used the boundary condition for m = 0. finally, replacing m in
the last identity with ln(1 + l) and expanding both sides to order ln gives general
expressions for determinants of n  n matrices in terms of traces:

det(1 + l) = etr ln(1+l)  det l = 1

n!(tr l)n  1

2(n2)! (tr l2)(tr l)n2 +   

exercise ib3.1

use the denition of the determinant (and not its relation to the trace) to
show

det(ab) = det(a)det(b)

these identities can also be derived by dening the determinant in terms of a
gaussian integral. we rst collect some general properties of (indenite) gaussian
integrals. the simplest such integral is

ex2/2(cid:19)d/2

the complex form of this integral is

z ddz* ddz

(2i)d e|z|2

= 1

by reducing to real parameters as z = (x + iy)/2. these generalize to integrals
involving a real, symmetric matrix s or a hermitian matrix h as

z

ddx
(2)d/2 ext sx/2 = (det s)1/2,

z ddz* ddz

(2i)d ezhz = (det h)1

by diagonalizing the matrices, making appropriate redenitions of the integration
variables, and identifying the determinant of a diagonal matrix. alternatively, we
can use these integrals to dene the determinant, and derive the previous denition.
the relation for the symmetric matrix follows from that for the hermitian one by
separating z into its real and imaginary parts for the special case h = s. if we treat
z and z* as independent variables, the determinant can also be understood as the
jacobian for the (dummy) variable change z  h1z, z*  z*. more generally, if
we dene the integral by an appropriate limiting procedure or analytic continuation
(for convergence), we can choose z and z* to be unrelated (or even separate real
variables), and s and h to be complex.

76

exercise ib3.2

other properties of determinants can also be derived directly from the integral
denition:

a find an integral expression for the inverse of a (complex) matrix m by using

the identity

0 =z


zi

(zj ezm z)

b derive the identity  ln det m = tr(m1m) by varying the gaussian de-

nition of the (complex) determinant with respect to m.

an even better denition of the determinant is in terms of an anticommuting
integral (see subsection ia2), since anticommutativity automatically gives the anti-
symmetry of the levi-civita tensor, and we dont have to worry about convergence.
we then have, for any matrix m,

z dd dd e m  = det m

and do the same for the (commuting or anticommuting) variables used in
dening its determinant. show that

det(cid:18) a b

c d(cid:19) = det d  det(a  bd1c) = det a  det(d  ca1b)

a by integrating over one part of the variables rst (this requires o-diagonal
changes of variables of the form y  y + ox, which have unit jacobian), or

b by rst proving the identity

c d(cid:19) =(cid:18) i bd1
(cid:18) a b

0

0

d(cid:19)(cid:18) i

where  can be chosen as the hermitian conjugate of  or as an independent variable,
whichever is convenient. from the denition of anticommuting integration, the only
terms in the taylor expansion of the exponential that contribute are those with the
product of one of each anticommuting variable. total antisymmetry in  and in 
then yields the determinant; we dene dd dd to give the correct normalization.
(the normalization is ambiguous anyway because of the signs in ordering the ds.)
this determinant can also be considered a jacobian, but the inverse of the commuting
result follows from the fact that the integrals are now really derivatives.

normalization of d2d; the determinant of an odd-dimensional antisymmetric matrix
vanishes, since det m = det m t ). however, there is now an important dierence: the
pfaan is not merely the square root of the determinant, but itself a polynomial,

of 22 matrices. this description is the most convenient for not only spin 1/2, but
all spins. this result can be extended to orthogonal groups (such as the rotation,
lorentz, and conformal groups) in other low dimensions, including all those relevant
to spacetime symmetries in four dimensions.

there are an innite number of lie groups. of the compact ones, all but a nite
number are among the classical lie groups. these classical groups can be dened
easily in terms of (real or complex) matrices satisfying a few simple constraints. (the
remaining exceptional compact groups can be dened in a similar way with a little
extra eort, but they are of rather specialized interest, so we wont cover them here.)
these matrices are thus called the dening representation of the group. (sometimes
this representation is also called the fundamental representation; however, this term
has been used in slightly dierent ways in the literature, so we will avoid it.) these
constraints are a subset of:

volume:

metric:

reality:

hermitian:

(anti)symmetric:(cid:26) orthogonal:

special:
unitary:

symplectic:
real:

where g is any matrix in the dening representation of the group, while , ,  are
group metrics, dening inner products (while the determinant denes the volume,
as in the jacobian). for the compact cases  and  can be chosen to be the identity,
but we will also consider some noncompact cases. (there are also some uninteresting
variations of special for complex matrices, setting the determinant to be real or its
magnitude to be 1.)

exercise ib4.1

write all the dening constraints of the classical groups (s, u, o, sp, r,
pseudoreal) in terms of the algebra rather than the group.

note the modied denition of unitarity, etc. such things are also encountered
in quantum mechanics with ghosts, since the resulting hilbert space can have an
indenite metric. for example, if we have a nite-dimensional hilbert space where
the inner product is represented in terms of matrices as

h|i =  

then observables satisfy a pseudohermiticity condition

h|hi = hh|i   h = h

and unitarity generalizes to

hu|ui = h|i  u u = 

similar remarks apply when replacing the hilbert-space sesquilinear (vector times
complex conjugate of vector) inner product with a symmetric (orthogonal) or anti-
symmetric (symplectic) bilinear inner product. an important example is when the
wave function carries a lorentz vector index, as expected for a relativistic description
of spin 1; then clearly the time component is unphysical.

the groups of matrices that can be constructed from these conditions are then:

gl(n,c) [sl(n,c)]

u: [s]u(n+,n)
o: [s]o(n,c)
sp: sp(2n,c)
r: gl(n) [sl(n)]
*: [s]u*(2n)

of the non-determinant constraints, in the rst column we applied none (gl means
general linear, and c refers to the complex numbers; the real numbers r are

b. indices

79

implicit); in the second column we applied one; in the third column we applied three,
since two of the three types (unitarity, symmetry, reality) imply the third.
(the
corresponding groups with unit determinant, when distinct, are given in brackets.)
these square matrices are of size n, n++n, 2n, or 2n++2n, as indicated. n+ and
n refer to the number of positive and negative eigenvalues of the metric  or .
o(n) diers from so(n) by including parity-type transformations, which cant be
obtained continuously from the identity. (ssp(2n) is the same as sp(2n).) for this
reason, and also for studying topological properties, for nite transformations it
is sometimes more useful to work directly with the group elements g, rather than
parametrizing them in terms of algebra elements as g = eig. u(n) diers from su(n)
(and similarly for gl(n) vs. sl(n)) only by including a u(1) group that commutes
with the su(n): although u(1) is noncompact (it consists of just phase transforma-
tions), a compact form of it can be used by requiring that all charges are integers
(i.e., all representations transform as  = eiq for group parameter , where q is an
integer dening the representation).

of these groups, the compact ones are just su(n), so(n) (and o(n)), and usp(2n)
(all with n=0). the compact groups have an interesting interpretation in terms of
various number systems: so(n) is the unitary group of nn matrices over the real
numbers, su(n) is the same for the complex numbers, and usp(2n) is the same for
the quaternions. (similar interpretations can be made for some of the noncompact
groups.) the remaining compact lie groups that we didnt discuss, the exceptional
groups, can be interpreted as unitary groups over the octonions. (unlike the classical
groups, which form innite series, there are only ve exceptional compact groups,
because of the restrictions following from the nonassociativity of octonions.)

5. tensor notation

although historically group representations have usually been taught in the no-
tation where an m-component representation of a group dened by nn matrices is
represented by an m-component vector, carrying a single index with values 1 to m,
a much more convenient and transparent method is tensor notation, where a gen-
eral representation carries many indices ranging from 1 to n, with certain symmetries
(and perhaps tracelessness) imposed on them. (tensor notation for a covering group
is generally known as spinor notation for the corresponding orthogonal group: see
subsection ic5.) this notation takes advantage of the property described above for
expressing arbitrary representations in terms of direct products of vectors. in terms
of transformation laws, it means we need to know only the dening representation,

80

i. global

since the transformation of this representation is applied to each index. there are
at most four vector representations, by taking the dual and complex conjugate; we
use the corresponding index notation. then the group constraints simply state the
invariance of the group metrics (and their complex conjugates and inverses), which
thus can be used to raise, lower, and contract indices:

volume:

(anti)symmetric:(cid:26) orthogonal:

as a result, we have relations such as

i|ji =

.
ij

we also dene inverse metrics satisfying

kikj = kikj = 

.
ki .

kj = i

j

(and similarly for contracting the second index of each pair). therefore, with uni-
tarity/(pseudo)reality we can ignore complex conjugate representations (and dotted
indices), converting them into unconjugated ones with the metric, while for orthogo-
nality/symplecticity we can do the same with respect to raising/lowering indices:

orthogonal: i = ijj
symplectic: i = ij j

for the real groups there is also the constraint of reality on the dening representation:

exercise ib5.1

as an example of the advantages of index notation, show that ssp is the
same as sp. (hint: write one  in the denition of the determinant in terms
of s by total antisymmetrization, which then can be dropped because it
is enforced by the other . one can ignore normalization by just showing
det m = det i.)

b. indices

81

for so(n+,n), there is a slight modication of a sign convention: since then
indices can be raised and lowered with the metric, i... is usually dened to be the
result of raising indices on i..., which means

12...n = 1  12...n = det  = (1)n

then i... should be replaced with (1)ni... in the equations of subsection ib3: for
example,

j1...jni1...in = (1)ni1

[j1    in

jn]

we now give the simplest explicit forms for the dening representations of the
classical groups. the most convenient notation is to label the generators by a pair
of fundamental indices, since the adjoint representation is obtained from the direct
product of the fundamental representation and its dual (i.e., as a matrix labeled by
row and column). the simplest example is gl(n), since the generators are arbitrary
matrices. we therefore choose as a basis matrices with a 1 as one entry and 0s
everywhere else, and label that generator by the row and column where the 1 appears.
explicitly,

gl(n) :

(gi

j )k

l = l

i j

k  gi

j = |jihi|

j gj

this basis applies for gl(n,c) as well, the only dierence being that the coecients
i are complex instead of real. the next simplest case is u(n): we can
 in g = i
j are not all hermitian, by requiring
again use this basis, although the matrices gi
j be a hermitian matrix. this turns out to be more convenient in practice
that i
than using a hermitian basis for the generators. a well known example is su(2),
where the two generators with the 1 as an o-diagonal element (and 0s elsewhere)
are known as the raising and lowering operators j, and are more convenient than
their hermitian parts for purposes of contructing representations. (this generalizes
to other unitary groups, where all the generators on one side of the diagonal are
raising, all those on the other side are lowering, and those along the diagonal give the
maximal abelian subalgebra, or cartan subalgebra.)

representations for the other classical groups follow from applying their deni-

tions to the gl(n) basis. we thus nd

sl(n) :

(gi

j )k

so(n) :

sp(n) :

l = l

(gij)kl = k
(gij)kl = k

i l
[i l
(i l

j = |jihi|  1

k  gi
j]  gij = |[iihj]|
j)  gij = |(iihj)|

n j

i |kihk|

as before, sl(n,c) and su(n) use the same basis as sl(n), etc. for so(n) and sp(n)
we have raised and lowered indices with the appropriate metric (so so(n) includes

82

i. global

so(n+,n)). for some purposes (especially for sl(n)), its more convenient to impose
tracelessness or (anti)symmetry on the matrix , and use the simpler gl(n) basis.

exercise ib5.2

our normalization for the generators of the classical groups is the simplest,
and independent of n (except for subtracting out traces):

a find the commutation relations of the generators (structure constants) for the
dening representation of gl(n) as given in the text. note that the values of
all the structure constants are 0, i. show that

(see subsection ib2).

cd = 1

b consider the gl(m) subgroup of gl(n) (m<n) found by restricting the range
of the index of the above dening representation. show the structure con-
stants are the same as those given by starting with the above representation
of gl(m).

c find the structure constants for so(n) and sp(n).

d directly evaluate kdca (= ijgigj) for sl(n), so(n), and sp(n), and compare

with cdda/dd.

exercise ib5.3

a tensor that pops up in various contexts is

dijk = tr(gi{gj, gk})

it takes a very simple form in terms of dening indices:

a show that for su(n) this tensor is determined to be, up to an overall normal-

ization (that depends on the representation),

tr(cid:0)gi1

j1(cid:8)gi2

j2, gi3

j3(cid:9)(cid:1)  [(231)+(312)]
(abc)  j1

ia j2

(where a, b, c are some permutation of 1, 2, 3) from just the total symmetry
of dijk (and gi
i . (if ij...
were used, ij... would also be required, to balance the number of subscripts
and superscripts; but their product can be expressed in terms of just s also.)

i = 0), since the only invariant tensor available is j

b check this result by using the explicit gs for the dening representation, and

determine the proportionality constant for that representation.

b. indices

83

with the exception of the spinor representations of so(n) (to be discussed
in subsection ic5, section iia, and subsection xc1), general representations can be
obtained by reducing direct products of the dening representations. this means they
can be described by objects with multiple indices (up/down, dotted/undotted), where
each index is that of a dening representation, and satisfying various (anti)symmetry
and tracelessness conditions on the indices.

exercise ib5.4

consider the representations of su(n) obtained from the symmetric and an-
tisymmetric part of the direct product of two dening representations. for
simplicity, one can work with the u(n) generators, since the u(1) pieces will
appear in a simple way.

resentation for these two representations.

b by evaluating the trace, show that the dynkin index for the two cases is

ca = n  2,

cs = n + 2

c show the sum of these two is consistent with the argument at the end of
subsection ib2. show each case is consistent with n=2, and the antisymmetric
case with n=3, by relating those cases to the singlet, dening, and adjoint
representations.

we now consider some of the more useful representations, as explicit examples
of the results of the previous section. in particular, we consider symmetries of the
quark model.

1. more coordinates

we began our review of group theory by looking at how symmetries were rep-
resented on coordinates. we now return to coordinates as a special case (particular
representation) of the general results of the previous section. the idea is that the
coordinates themselves are already a representation of the group, and the wave func-
tions are functions of these coordinates. for example, for ordinary rotations we use
wave functions that depend on position or momentum, which transforms as a vec-
tor. (this is not always the case: for example, in our description of the conformal
group the usual space and time coordinates transformed nonlinearly, and not just
by multiplication by constant matrices unless the extra two coordinates were intro-
duced.) this is the basic distinction between classical mechanics and classical eld
theory: mechanics uses the coordinates themselves as the basic variables, while eld
theory uses functions of the coordinates. (similarly, in quantum mechanics the wave
functions are functions of the coordinates, while in quantum eld theory the wave
functions are functionals of functions of the coordinates.)

in general, the construction of such a coordinate representation starts with a
j and then denes a

given matrix representation (usually nite dimensional) (gi)i
new representation

gi = qi(gi)i

j pj ;

[pi, qj} = j
i ,

[q, q} = [p, p} = 0

for some objects q and p, which are interpreted as either coordinates and their con-
jugate momenta (up to a factor of i), or as creation and annihilation operators: the
latter nomenclature is used when the boundary conditions allow the existence of a
state |0i called the vacuum, satisfying p|0i = 0, so we can dene the other states
as functions of q acting on |0i. (if the coordinates are fermionic, the distinction is
moot, since by the usual taylor expansion the hilbert space is nite dimensional. see
exercise ia2.3.) it is easy to check that gi satisfy the same commutation relations
as gi. in particular, if the matrices are in the adjoint representation, qi can be inter-
preted as the group coordinates themselves: this follows from considering the action
of an innitesimal transformation on the group element g(q) = eiqigi (or just the lie
algebra element g(q) = qigi).

c. representations

85

if we write these results in bra/ket notation, since

giqi = qj (gi)j

i,

gipi = (gi)i

j pj

it is more natural to look at the action on bras:

hq| = qihi|,

|pi = |iipi  gihq| = hq|gi,

gi|pi = gi|pi

note that this vector space is coordinate space itself, not the space of functions of
the coordinates; it is the same space on which gi is dened. (of course, gi is dened
on arbitrary functions of the coordinates; it has a reducible representation bigger
j is represented on the space of functions linear in the
than (gi)i
coordinates.) then, for example

j. eectively, (gi)i

g1 g2hq| = g1hq|g2 = hq|g1g2

is obviously equivalent, while (ignoring any extra signs for fermions)

g1 g2|pi =  g1g2|pi = g2 g1|pi = g2g1|pi

at least gives an equivalent result for the commutator algebra [ g1, g2]. this is the
expected result for the dual representation gi  gt
i .

interesting examples are given by using the dening representation for g. for

example, the commonly used oscillator representation for u(n) is

u(n) :

gi

j = aj ai,

[ai, aj} = j

i

where the oscillators can be bosonic or fermionic. for the so and sp cases, because
we can raise and lower indices, and because of the (anti)symmetry on the indices, the
interesting possibility arises to identify the coordinates with their momenta, with the
statistics appropriate to the symmetry:

sp(n) :

gij = 1

2z(i zj),

[zi, zj ] = ij

so(n) :

gij = 1

2 [ij],

{i, j} = ij

for so(n) the representation is nite dimensional because of the fermi-dirac statis-
tics, and is called a dirac spinor (and  the dirac matrices).
if the opposite
statistics are chosen, the coordinates and momenta cant be identied: for example,
bosonic coordinates for so(n) give the usual spatial rotation generators gij = x[ij].

exercise ic1.1

use this bosonic oscillator representation for u(2)=su(2)u(1), and use the
su(2) subgroup to describe spin.

86

i. global

a show that the spin s (the integer or half-integer number that denes the rep-

resentation) itself has a very simple expression in terms of the u(1) generator.

show this holds in the quantum mechanical case (by interpreting the bracket

as the quantum commutator), giving the usual s(s + 1) for the sum of the

squares of the generators (with appropriate normalization).

b use this result to show that these oscillators, acting on the vacuum state, can

be used to construct the usual states of arbitrary spin s.

exercise ic1.2

considering so(2n), divide up i into pairs of canonical (and complex) con-

jugates a1 = (1 + i2)/2, etc., so {a, a} = 1.

a write the so(2n) generators in terms of aa, aa, and aa. show that the

aas by themselves generate a u(n) subgroup.

b decompose the dirac spinor into u(n) representations. show that the product

of all the s is related to the u(1) generator, and commutes with all the

so(2n) generators. show that the states created by even or odd numbers of
as on the vacuum dont mix with each other under so(2n), so the dirac
spinor is reducible into two weyl spinors.

2. coordinate tensors

we have just seen how groups can be represented on coordinates. depending

on the choice of coordinates, the coordinates may transform nonlinearly (i.e., as a

realization, not a representation), as for the d-dimensional conformal group in terms

of d (not d+2) coordinates. however, given the nonlinear transformation of the

coordinates, there are always representations other than the dening one (scalar eld)

that we can immediately write down (such as the adjoint). we now consider such

representations: these are useful not only for the spacetime symmetries we have

already considered, but also for general relativity, where the symmetry group consists

of arbitrary coordinate transformations. furthermore, these considerations are useful

for describing coordinate transformations that are not symmetries, such as the change

from cartesian to polar coordinates in nonrelativistic theories.

when applied to quantum mechanics, we write the action of a symmetry on a
state as  = ig (or  = eig), but on an operator as a = i[g, a] (or a =
eigaeig).
in classical mechanics, we always write a = i[g, a] (since classical
objects are identied with quantum operators, not states). however, if g = mm is

c. representations

87

a coordinate transformation (e.g., a rotation) and  is a scalar eld, then in quantum
notation we can write

(x) = [g, ] = g = mm

( = egeg = eg)

since the derivatives in g just dierentiate .
(for this discussion of coordinate
transformations we switch to absorbing the is into the generators.) the coordinate
transformation g has the usual properties of a derivative:

[g, f (x)] = gf  gf1f2 = [g, f1f2] = (gf1)f2 + f1gf2
egf1f2 = egf1f2eg = (egf1eg)(egf2eg) = (egf1)(egf2)

and similarly for products of more functions.

the adjoint representation of coordinate transformations is a vector eld (in the
sense of a spatial vector), a function that has general dependence on the coordinates
(like a scalar eld) but is also linear in the momenta (as are the poincare generators):

g = m(x)m,

v = v m(x)m  v = [g, v ] = (mmv n  v mmn)n

 v m = nnv m  v nnm

the same result follows if we use the poisson bracket instead of the quantum me-
chanical commutator, replacing m with ipm in both g and v .

finite transformations can also be expressed in terms of transformed coordinates

themselves, instead of the transformation parameter:

(x) = emm(x) = (emmx)

as seen, for example, from a taylor expansion of , using eg = egeg. we then
dene

(x) = (x)  x = emmx

this is essentially the statement that the active and passive transformations cancel.
however, in general this method of dening coordinate transformations is not con-
venient for applications: when we make a coordinate transformation, we want to
know (x). working with the inverse transformation on the coordinates, i.e., our
original e+g,

x  e+mmx  (x) = eg(x) = (x(x))

so, for nite transformations, we work directly in terms of x(x), and simply plug this
into  in place of x (x  x(x)) to nd  as a function of x.

88

i. global

similar remarks apply for the vector, and for derivatives in general. we then use

x = egx   = egeg

where  = /x, since x = x = . this tells us

v m(x)m = egv m(x)meg = v m(x)m

or v (x) = v (x). acting with both sides on xm,

v m(x) = v n(x)

xm
xn

on the other hand, working in terms of x is again more convenient: changing the
transformation for the vector operator in the same way as the scalar

v (x) = v (x)

 v m(x)m = v m(x) m
xm
 v m(x) = v n(x)
 xn

where  = / x and as usual

( mxn)(n xp) = p

m 

we can also use

xn

 xm = "(cid:18)  x(x)

x (cid:19)1#m

n

v (x) = egv (x)eg

 v m(x)m = (egv m(x)eg)(egmeg) = v m(x) m

a dierential form is dened as an innitesimal w = dxmwm(x). its transfor-
mation law under coordinate transformations, like that of scalar and vector elds, is
dened by w (x) = w (x). for any vector eld v = v m(x)m, v mwm transforms as
a scalar, as follows from the chain rule d = dxmm = dxmm. explicitly,

or in innitesimal form

w m(x) = wn(x)

xn
xm

wm = nnwm + wnmn

thus a dierential form is dual to a vector, at least as far as the matrix part of coor-
dinate transformations is concerned. they transform the same way under rotations,
because rotations are orthogonal; however, more generally they transform dierently,

c. representations

89

and in the absence of a metric there is not even a way to relate the two by raising or
lowering indices.

higher-rank dierential forms can be dened by antisymmetric products of the

above one-forms. these are useful for integration: just as the line integralr w =
r dxmwm is invariant under coordinate transformations by denition (as long as we

choose the curve along which the integral is performed in a coordinate-independent
way), so is a totally antisymmetric nth-rank tensor (n-form) wm1mn integrated
on an n-dimensional subspace as

z dxm1    dxmn wm1mn :

w m1mn (x) = wp1pn (x)

xp1
xm1   

xpn
xmn

where the surface element dxm1    dxmn is interpreted as antisymmetric. (the signs
come from switching initial and nal limits of integration, as prescribed by the ori-
entation of the hypersurface.) this is clear if we rewrite the integral more explicitly
in terms of coordinates i for the subspace: then

z dxm1    dxmn wm1mn (x) =z di1    dincwi1in () =z dn  i1incwi1in ()

where

is the result of a coordinate transformation that converts n of the xs to s, an
interpretation of the functions x() that dene the surface. then any coordinate

transformation on x  x (not on ) will leave cw () invariant. in particular, if the
subspace is the full space, so we can look directly atr dn x m1mn wm1mn , we see

that a coordinate transformation generates from w an n-dimensional determinant
exactly canceling the jacobian resulting from changing the integration measure dn x.

exercise ic2.1

for all of the following, use the exponential form of the nite coordinate
transformation:

a show that any (local) function of a scalar eld (without explicit x dependence
additional to that in the eld) is also a scalar eld (i.e., satises the same
coordinate transformation law).

b show that the transformation law of a vector eld or dierential form remains

the same when multiplied by a scalar eld (at the same x).

c show that v  = v mm is a scalar eld for any scalar eld  and vector eld

v .

d show that [v, w ] is a vector eld for any vector elds v and w .

exercise ic2.2

examine nite coordinate transformations for integrals of dierential forms
in terms of x rather than x. find the explicit expression for w (x) in terms
of w (x(x)), etc., and use this to show invariance:

z dxm1    dxmn w m1mn (x) =z dxm1    dxmn wm1mn (x)

=z dxm1    dxmn wm1mn (x)

where in the last step we have simply substituted x  x as a change of integra-
tion variables. note that, using the x form of the transformation rather than
x, the transformation generates the needed jacobian, rather than canceling
one.

from the above transformation law, we see that the curl of a dierential form is

also a dierential form:

[m1w m2mn ](x) = [m1(m2xp2)   (mn ]xpn )wp2pn (x)

= [[p1wp2pn ](x)](m1xp1)   (mn xpn )

because the curl kills x terms that would appear if there were no antisymmetriza-
tion. objects that transform covariantly under coordinate transformations, without
such higher derivatives of x (or  in the other notation), like scalars, vectors, dieren-
tial forms and their products, are called (coordinate) tensors. getting derivatives of
tensors to come out covariant in general requires special elds, and will be discussed
in chapter ix. an important application of the covariance of the curl of dierential
forms is the generalized stokes theorem (which includes the usual stokes theorem
and gauss law as special cases):

z dxm1    dxmn+1

(n +1)! [m1wm2mn+1] =i dxm1    dxmn wm1mn

where the second integral is over the boundary of the space over which the rst is

integrated. (we use the symbol h  to refer to boundary integrals, including those
fundamental theorem of (integral) calculus (r b

over contours, which are closed boundaries of 2d surfaces.) it is basically just the
a dx f(x) = f (b)  f (a)), as is clear
from choosing a coordinate system where the boundary is at a xed value of just one
coordinate (at least in patches). (a standard example is a pair of innite constant-
time surfaces, neglecting the boundaries that connect them at spatial innity.)

we now return to our discussion of nite-dimensional representations.

in the
previous section we gave the machinery for describing them using index notation,
but examined only the dening representation in detail. now we analyze general
irreducible representations.

all the irreducible nite-dimensional representations of the groups su(n) can be
described by tensors with lower n-valued indices with various (anti)symmetrizations.
(an upper index can be replaced with n1 lower indices by using the levi-civita
tensor.) although detailed calculations require explicit use of these indices, three
properties can be more conveniently discussed pictorially:

(1) the (anti)symmetries of the indices,

(2) the dimension (number of independent components) of the representation, and

(3) the reduction of the direct product of two representations (which irreducible rep-

resentations result, and how many of each).

a young tableau is a picture representing an irreducible representation in terms
of boxes arranged in a regular grid into rows and columns, such that the columns are
aligned at the top, and their depths are nonincreasing to the right: for example,

each box represents an index, with antisymmetry among indices in any column, and
symmetry among indices in any row. more precisely, since one cant simultaneously
have these symmetries and antisymmetries, it corresponds to the result of taking any
arbitrary tensor with that many indices, rst symmetrizing the indices in each row,
and then antisymmetrizing the indices in each column (or vice versa; symmetrizing
and then antisymmetrizing and then symmetrizing again gives the same result as
skipping the rst symmetrization, etc.). this gives a simple way to classify and
symbolize each representation. (we can denote the singlet representation, which has
no boxes, by a dot.) note that the deepest column should have no more than n1
boxes for su(n) because of the antisymmetry.

to calculate the dimension of the representation for a given tableau, we use the

factors over hooks rule:

(1) write an n in the box in the upper-left corner, and ll the rest of the boxes
with numbers that decrease by 1 for each step down and increase by 1 for each
step to the right.

92

(2) draw (or picture in your mind) a hook for each box  a   with its corner

in the box and lines extending right and down out of the tableau.

(3) the dimension is then given by the formula

dimension = yeach box

integer written there

# boxes intersected by its hook

for the previous example, we nd (listing boxes rst down and then to the right)

the direct product of two young tableaux ab is analyzed by the following rules:
first, label all the boxes in b by putting an a in each box in the top row, b in
the second row, etc. then, take the following steps in all possible ways to nd the
young tableaux resulting from the direct product:

(1) add all the a boxes from b to the right side and bottom of a, then b to
the right and bottom of that, etc., to make a new young tableaux. any two
tableaux constructed in this way with the same arrangement of boxes but dierent
assignment of letters are considered distinct, i.e., multiple occurences of the same
representation in the direct product.

(2) no more than 1 a can be in any column, and similarly for the other letters.

(3) reading from right to left, and then from top to bottom (i.e., like hebrew/arabic),

the number of as read should always be  the number of bs, bs  cs, etc.

for example,

 a

b

a = b

a a  a

a

b  a

b

a

note that ab always gives the same result as ba, but one way may be simpler
than the other. for a given value of n, a column of n boxes is equivalent to none
(again by antisymmetry), while more than n boxes in a column gives a vanishing
tableau.

adding them up.

these su(n) tableaux also apply to sl(n): only the reality properties are dif-
ferent. similar methods can be applied to usp(2n) (or sp(2n)), but tracelessness

93

(with respect to the symplectic metric) must be imposed in antisymmetrized indices,

so these trace pieces must be separated out when considering the above rules. (i.e.,
consider usp(2n)su(2n).) similar remarks apply to so(n), which has a symmet-
ric metric, but there are also spinor representations (see below). the additional

irreducible representations then can be constructed from taking direct products of

the above with the smallest spinors, and removing the gamma-matrix traces. fur-

thermore, using the levi-civita tensor, all columns can be reduced to no more than

n/2 in height.

4. color and avor

we now consider the application of these methods to internal symmetries (those

that dont act on the coordinates) in particle physics. the symmetries with experi-

mental conrmation involve only the unitary groups (u and su) of small dimension.

however, we will nd later that larger unitary groups can be useful for approxima-

tion schemes. (also, larger unitary and other groups continue to be investigated for

unication and other purposes, which we consider in later chapters.)

the standard model describes all of particle physics that is well conrmed

experimentally (except gravity, which is not understood at the quantum level).

it

includes as its fundamental particles:

(1) the spin-1/2 quarks that make up the observed strongly interacting particles, but

do not exist as asymptotic states,

(2) the weakly interacting spin-1/2 leptons,

(3) the spin-1 gluons that bind the quarks together, which couple to the charges

associated with su(3) color symmetry, but also are not asymptotic,

(4) the spin-1 particles that mediate the weak and electromagnetic interactions, which

couple to su(2)u(1) avor, and

(5) the yet unobserved spin-0 higgs particles that are responsible for all the masses

of these weakly interacting particles.

(however, quarks and gluons are temporarily free at high energy, eventually recom-

bining to give rise to jets, clusters of resulting hadrons.) these particles, along
with their masses (in gev) and (electromagnetic) charges (q = q + q), are:

the quark masses we have listed are the current quark masses, the eective masses
when the quarks are relativistic with respect to their hadron (at least for the lighter
quarks), and act as almost free. but since they are not free, their masses are ambigu-
ous and energy dependent, and dened by some convenient conventions. nonrelativis-
tic quark models use instead the constituent quark masses, which include potential
energy from the gluons. this extra potential energy is about .30 gev per quark in
the lightest mesons, .35 gev in the lightest baryons; there is also a contribution to
the binding energy from spin-spin interaction. unlike electrodynamics, where the po-
tential energy is negative because the electrons are free at large distances, where the
potential levels o (the top of the well), in chromodynamics the potential energy is
positive because the quarks are free at high energies (short distances, the bottom of
the well), and the potential is innitely rising. masslessness of the gluons is implied
by the fact that no colorful asymptotic states have ever been observed. we have
divided the spin-1/2 particles into 3 families with the same quantum numbers (but
dierent masses). within each family, the quarks are similar to the leptons, except
that:
(1) the masses and average charges ( q) are dierent,

(2) the quarks come in 3 colors, while the leptons are colorless, and

(3) the neutrinos, to within experimental error, are massless, so they have half as
many components as the massive fermions (1 helicity state each, instead of 2 spin
states each).

this means that each lepton family has 1 su(2) doublet and 1 su(2) singlet. for
symmetry (and better, quantum mechanical, reasons to be explained later), we also
assume the quarks have 1 su(2) doublet, but therefore 2 su(2) singlets. (some exper-
iments have indicated small masses for neutrinos: this would require generalization

c. representations

95

of the standard model, such as models with parity broken by interactions. some
examples of such theories will be discussed in subsection ivb4.)

we rst look at the color group theory of the physical states, which are color
singlets. the fundamental unobserved particles are the spin-1 gluons, described by
the yang-mills gauge elds, and the spin-1/2 quarks. suppressing all but color indices,
we denote the quark states by qi, and the antiquarks by qi, where the indices are those
of the dening representation of su(n), and its complex conjugate. the quarks also
carry a representation of a avor group, unlike the gluons. the simplest avorful
states are those made up of only (anti)quarks, with indices completely contracted by
one factor of an su(n) group metric: from the u of su(n), we can contract dening
indices with their complex conjugates, giving the mesons, described by qiqi (quark-
antiquark), which are their own antiparticles. from the s of su(n), we have the
baryons, described by i1...inqi1...qin (n-quark), and the antibaryons, described by
the complex conjugate elds. all other colorless states made of just (anti)quarks
can be written as products of these elds, and therefore considered as describing
composites of them. thus, we can approximate the ground states of the mesons by
qi(x)qi(x), which describe spins 0 and 1 because of the various combinations of spins
(from 1
 q (where

2 = 0  1). the rst excited level will then be described by q

and picks out the relative momentum of the two quarks): it includes spins 0, 1, and 2,
etc., where each derivative introduces orbital angular momentum 1. (similar remarks
apply to baryons.) we can also have avorless states made from just gluons, called
i, where each f is a gluon
glueballs: the ground states can be described by fi
state (in the adjoint representation of su(n)), and includes spins 0 and 2 (from the
symmetric part of 1  1). because of their avor multiplets and (electroweak) inter-
actions, many mesons and baryons corresponding to such ground and excited states
have been experimentally identied, while the glueballs existence is still uncertain.
actually, quarks and gluons can almost be observed independently at high energies,
where the strong interaction is weak: the energetic particle appears as a jet 
a particle of high energy accompanied by particles of much lower energy (perhaps
too small to detect) in color-singlet combinations. (depending on the available decay
modes, the jet might not be observed until after decaying, but still within a small
angle of spread.)

we now look at the avor group theory of the physical hadronic states. in contrast

qiqj are thus in the adjoint representation of avor u(m) (m  m, where m is the
dening representation and m its complex conjugate), for both the spin-0 and the
spin-1 ground states. the baryons are more complicated: for simplicity we consider
su(3) color, which accurately describes physics at observed energies. then the color
structure described above results in total symmetry in combined avor and lorentz
indices (from the antisymmetry in the color indices, and the overall antisymmetry for
fermi-dirac statistics). thus, for the 3-quark baryons, the young tableaux





for su(m) avor are accompanied by the same young tableaux for spin indices: in
nonrelativistic notation, the rst tableau, being totally antisymmetric in avor in-
dices, is also totally antisymmetric in the three two-valued spinor indices, and thus
vanishes. similarly, the last tableau describes spin 3/2 (total symmetry in both types
of indices), while the middle one describes spin 1/2. since only 3 avors of quarks
have small masses compared to the hadronic mass scale, hadrons can be most conve-
niently grouped into avor multiplets for su(3) avor: the ground states are then,
in terms of su(3) avor multiplets, 81 for the pseudoscalars, 81 for the vectors, 8
for spin 1/2, and 10 for spin 3/2.

exercise ic4.1

what su(avor) young tableaux, corresponding to what spins, would we have
for mesons and baryons if there were

a 2 colors?

b 4 colors?

however, the diering masses of the dierent avors of quarks break the su(3)
avor symmetry (as does the weak interaction). in particular, the mass eigenstates
tend to be pure states of the various combinations of the dierent avors of quarks,
rather than the linear combinations expected from the avor symmetry. specically,
the linear combinations predicted by an 81 separation for mesons (trace and traceless
pieces of a 33 matrix) are replaced with particles that are more accurately described
by a particular avor of quark bound to a particular avor of antiquark. (this is
known as ideal mixing.) the one exception is the lighest mesons (pseudoscalars),
which are more accurately described by the 81 split, for this restriction to the 3
lighter avors of quarks, but the mass of the singlet diers from that naively expected
from group theory or nonrelativistic quark models.
(this is known as the u(1)
problem.) the solution is probably that the singlet mixes strongly with the lightest
psuedoscalar glueball (described by tr abcdfabfcd); the mass eigenstates are linear

c. representations

97

combinations of these two elds with the same quantum numbers. in any case, the
j representing the
most convenient notation for labeling the entries of the matrix mi
various meson states for any particular spin and angular momentum of the quark-

antiquark combination is that corresponding to the choice we gave earlier for the

generators of u(n): label each entry by a separate name, where the complex conjugate

appears reected across the diagonal. these directly correspond to the combination

of a particular quark with a particular antiquark, and to the mass eigenstates, with

the possible exception of the entries along the diagonal for the 3 lightest avors,

where the mass eigenstates are various linear combinations. (however, the su(2) of

the 2 lightest avors is only slightly broken by the quark masses, so in that case the
combinations are very close to the 31 split of su(2).)

for example, for the lightest multiplet of mesons (spin 0, and relative angular mo-

mentum 0 for the quark and antiquark, but not all of which have yet been observed),

we can write the u(6) matrix (for the 6 avors of the 3 known families)

5. covering groups

the orthogonal groups o(n+,n) are of obvious interest for describing lorentz
symmetry in spacetimes with n+ space and n time dimensions, or conformal sym-
metry in spacetimes with n+1 space and n1 time dimensions. this means we
should be interested in o(n) for n6, and their wick rotations: transformations
that put in extra factors of i to change some signs on the metric. coincidentally, these
are just the cases where the lie algebras of the orthogonal groups are equivalent to
those of some algebras for smaller matrices. the smaller representation then can be
identied as the spinor representation of that orthogonal group. since the vec-
tor, or dening representation space of the orthogonal group, itself is represented as
a matrix with respect to the other group (i.e., the state carries two spinor indices),
the other group may include certain phase transformations (such as 1) that cancel
in the transformation of the vector. the other group is then called the covering
group for that orthogonal group, since it includes those missing transformations in
its dening representation. (as a result, its group space also has a more interesting
topology, which we wont discuss here.)

one way to discover these covering groups is to rst count generators, then try
to construct explicitly the orthogonal metric on matrices. so(n) has n(n1)/2 gen-
erators (antisymmetric matrices), sp(n) has n(n+1)/2 (symmetric), and su(n) has
n21 (traceless). (these are hermitian generators, since we applied reality or her-
miticity.) so, for some group so(n), we look for another group that has the same
number of generators. then, if the new group is dened on mm matrices, we look
for conditions to impose on an mm matrix (not necessarily the adjoint) to get an

c. representations

99

n-component representation. this is easy to do by inspection for small n; for large n

its easy to see that it cant work, since m will be of the order of n, and the simple
constraints will give of the order of n2 components instead of n. we then construct
the norm of this matrix m as tr(mm), which is just the sum of the absolute value
squared of the components, for so(n), and the other orthogonal groups by wick

rotation. (wick rotation aects mainly the reality conditions on m.)

the identications for the lie algebras are then:

so(2) = u(1), so(1,1) = gl(1)

so(3) = su(2) = su*(2) = usp(2), so(2,1) = su(1,1) = sl(2) = sp(2)
so(4) = su(2)su(2), so(3,1) = sl(2,c) = sp(2,c),
so(5) = usp(4), so(4,1) = usp(2,2), so(3,2) = sp(4)

so(2,2) = sl(2)sl(2)

so(6) = su(4), so(5,1) = su*(4), so(4,2) = su(2,2), so(3,3) = sl(4)

note that the euclidean cases are all unitary, while the ones with (almost) equal

numbers of space and time dimensions are all real. there are also some similar

relations for the pseudoreal orthogonal groups:

so*(2) = u(1),

so*(4) = su(2)sl(2), so*(6) = su(3,1), so*(8) = so(6,2)

the norm and conditions for an m-spinor of so(n+,n) are:

(hint: consider

unfortunately, for so(n) for larger n, the spinor is as least as large as, and usu-

ally larger than, the vector. in general, the spinor is like the square root of the

vector, in that the vector can be found by taking the direct product of two spinors.

100

i. global

it is impossible to nd the spinor representation by taking direct products of vec-
tors. this situation occurs only for orthogonal groups: in all other classical groups,
all (nite-dimensional) representations are among those obtained from multiple di-
rect products of vectors. furthermore, in those cases the irreducible representa-
tions (those that cant be divided into smaller representations) can be picked out by
(anti)symmetrization, and by separating trace and traceless pieces (where traces are
taken with the group metrics). fortunately, for the above cases of orthogonal groups,
we can perform the same construction starting with the spinor representations, since
those are the vectors of non-orthogonal groups.

special relativity is simply the statement that the laws of nature are symmetric
under the poincare group. free relativistic quantum mechanics or eld theory is then
equivalent to a study of the representations of the poincare group. since the con-
formal group is a classical group, while its subgroup the poincare group is not, it is
easier to rst study the conformal group, which is sucient for nding the massless
representations of the poincare group. the massive ones then can be found by di-
mensional reduction, which gives them in the same form as occurs in interacting eld
theories. in four spacetime dimensions we use the covering group of the conformal
group, which is the easiest way to include spinors. these methods extend straight-
forwardly to supersymmetry, a symmetry between fermions and bosons that includes
the poincare group.

although we have already specialized to spacetime symmetries, we have consid-

dimensional lie groups have special properties, especially with regard to covering
groups. in this section we will take advantage of those features; specically, we ex-
amine the physical case d=4, where the rotation group is so(3)=su(2), the lorentz
group is so(3,1)=sl(2,c), and the conformal group is so(4,2)=su(2,2).

1. 3-vectors

the most important nontrivial lie group in physics is the rotations in three
dimensions. it is also the simplest nontrivial example of a lie group. this makes
it the ideal example to illustrate the properties discussed in the previous chapter,
as well as lay the groundwork for later discussions. we have already mentioned the
orbital part of rotations, i.e., the representation of rotations on spatial coordinates.
in this chapter we discuss the spin part; this is really the same as nding all (nite
dimensional, unitary) representations.

a useful way to understand spin, or general representations of the rotation group
in three dimensions of space, is to consider properties of 22 matrices. (this way
also generalizes in a very simple way to relativity, in three space and one time dimen-
sions.) consider such matrices to be hermitian, which is natural from the quantum
mechanical point of view. then they have four real components, one too many for a

a. two components

103

three-vector (but just right for a relativistic four-vector), so we restrict them to also
be traceless:

v = v ,

tr v = 0

the simplest way to get a single number out of a matrix, besides taking the trace, is
to take the determinant. by expanding a general matrix identity to quadratic order
we nd an identity for 22 matrices

det(i + m) = etr ln(i+m )  2 det m = tr(m 2)  (tr m)2

it is then clear that in our case det v is positive denite, as well as quadratic, so
we can dene the norm of this 3-vector as

this can be compared easily with conventional notation by picking a basis:

|v |2 = 2 det v = tr(v 2)

v = 12(cid:18)

v 1

v 2 + iv 3

v 2  iv 3

v 1 (cid:19) = ~v  ~  det v =  1

2 (v i)2

where ~ are the pauli  matrices, up to normalization. as usual, the inner product
follows from the norm:

|v + w|2 = |v |2 + |w|2 + 2v  w

 v  w = det v + det w  det(v + w ) = tr(v w )

applying our previous identities for determinants to 22 matrices, we have

mcm t c = i det m,

m1 = cm t c(det m)1

where we now use the imaginary, hermitian matrix

c =(cid:0) 0

i i

0(cid:1)

if we make the replacement m  em and expand to linear order in m, we nd

this implies

m + cm t c = i tr m

tr v = 0  (v c)t = v c

i.e., the tracelessness of v is equivalent to the symmetry of v c. furthermore, the
combination of the trace and determinant identities tell us

m 2 = m tr m  i det m  v 2 = i det v = i 1

2|v |2

104

ii. spin

here by v 2 we mean the square of the matrix, while |v |2= (v i)2 is the square
of the norm (neither of which should be confused with the component v 2 = v i2
i .)

again expressing the inner product in terms of the norm, we then nd

{v, w} = (v  w )i

also, since the commutator of two nite matrices is traceless, and picks up a minus
sign under hermitian conjugation, we can dene an outer product (vectorvector =
vector) by

[v, w ] = 2iv  w

combining these two results,

v w = 1

2(v  w )i + 12

iv  w

in other words, the product of two traceless hermitian 22 matrices gives a real trace
piece, symmetric in the two matrices, plus an antihermitian traceless piece, antisym-
metric in the two. thus, we have a simple relation between the matrix product, the
inner (dot) product and the outer (cross) product. therefore, the cross product
is a special case of the lie bracket, or commutator. this way of treating vectors
(except for factors of i) is basically hamiltons quaternions.

exercise iia1.1

check this result in two ways:

a show the normalization agrees with the usual outer product. using only the

above denition of v  w , along with {v, w} = (v  w )i, show
i|v  w|2 = ([v, w ])2 = i[|v |2|w|2  (v  w )2]

b use components, with the above basis.

exercise iia1.2

write an arbitrary two-dimensional vector in terms of a complex number as
v = 12

(vx  ivy).

a show that the phase (u(1)) transformation v  = v ei generates the usual
rotation. show that for any two vectors v1 and v2, v1*v2 is invariant, and
identify its real and imaginary parts in terms of well known vector prod-
ucts. what kind of transformation is v  v *, and how does it aect these
products?

b consider two-dimensional functions in terms of z = 12

12

(x  iy). show by the chain rule that z = 12

(x + iy) and z* =
(x  iy). write the real

a. two components

105

and imaginary parts of the equation z*v = 0 in terms of the divergence and
curl. (then v is a function of just z.)

c consider the complex integral

i dz

2i

v

where h  is a contour integral: an integral over a closed path in the
pn=

complex plane dened by parametrizing dz = du(dz/du) in terms of some
real parameter u. this is useful if v can be laurent expanded as v (z) =
cn(z  z0)n inside the contour about a point z0 there, since by con-
sidering circles z = z0 + rei we nd only the 1/(z  z0) term contributes.
show that this integral contains as its real and imaginary parts the usual line
integral and surface integral. (in two dimensions a surface element diers
from a line element only by its direction.) use this fact to solve gauss law
in two dimensions for a unit point charge as e = 1/4z.

exercise iia1.3

consider electromagnetism in 22 matrix notation: dene the eld strength
as a complex vector f = 2(e + ib). write partial derivatives as the sum
of a (rotational) scalar plus a (3-)vector as  = 12
it + , where t = /t
is the time derivative and  is the partial space derivatives written as a
traceless matrix. do the same for the charge density  and (3-)current j as
j =  12
i + j. using the denition of dot and cross products in terms of
matrix multiplication as discussed in this section, show that the simple matrix
equation f = j, when separated into its trace and traceless pieces, and
its hermitian and antihermitian pieces, gives the usual maxwell equations

  b = 0,   e = ,   e + tb = 0,   b  te = j

(note: avoid the pauli -matrices and explicit components.)

2. rotations

one convenience of representing three-vectors as 22 instead of 31 is that rota-
tions are easier to write. since vectors are hermitian, we expect their transformations
to be unitary:

v  = uv u,

u = u1

it is easily checked that this preserves the properties of these matrices:

(v ) = (uv u) = v ,

tr(v ) = tr(uv u1) = tr(u1uv ) = tr(v ) = 0

106

ii. spin

furthermore, it also preserves the norm (and thus the inner product):

det(v ) = det(uv u1) = det(u)det(v )(det u)1 = det v

unitary 22 matrices have 4 parameters; however, we can elimimate one by the
condition

det u = 1

this eliminates only the phase factor in u, which cancels out in the transformation
law anyway. taking the product of two rotations now involves multiplying only 22
matrices, and not 33 matrices.

we can also write u in exponential notation, which is useful for going to the

innitesimal limit:

u = eig  g = g,

tr g = 0

this means that g itself can be considered a vector. rotations can be parametrized

by a vector whose direction is the axis of rotation, and whose magnitude is (1/2)

the angle of rotation:

v  = eigv eig  v = i[g, v ] = 

2g  v

we also now see that the lie bracket we previously identied as the cross product is
the bracket for the rotation group.

exercise iia2.1

evaluate the elements of the matrix eig in closed form for a diagonal generator
g. generalize this result to arbitrary g. (hint: use rotational invariance.)

the hermiticity condition on v can also be expressed as a reality condition:

v = v  and tr v = 0  v * = cv c,

(v c)* = c(v c)c

where  *  is the usual complex conjugate. a similar condition for u is

u = u1 and det u = 1  u* = cuc

which is also a consequence of the fact that we can write u in terms of a vector as
u = eiv . as a result, the transformation law for the vector can be written in terms
of v c in a simple way, which manifestly preserves its symmetry:

(v c) = uv u1c = u(v c)u t

exercise iia2.2

we return to our example of d=2:

a. two components

107

a write an arbitrary rotation in two dimensions in terms of the slope (dy/dx)
of the rotation (the slope to which the x-axis is rotated) rather than the
angle. (this is actually more convenient to measure if you happen to have
a ruler, which you need to measure lengths anyway, but not a protractor.)
this avoids trigonometry, but introduces ugly square roots: compare lorentz
transformations. also note that this square root form covers only half of the
available angles.

b show that the square roots can be eliminated by using the slope of half the
angle of transformation as the variable. show the relation to the variables
used in writing 3d rotations in terms of 22 matrices, i.e., the use of complex
variables, as in exercise iia1.2a. (hint: consider u and v c diagonal.)

3. spinors

note that the mapping of su(2) to so(3) is two-to-one: this follows from the
fact v  = v when u is a phase factor. we eliminated continuous phase factors from
u by the condition det u = 1, which restricts u(2) to su(2). however,

det(iei) = e2i = 1  ei = 1

for 22 matrices. more generally, for any su(2) element u, u is also an element of
su(2), but acts the same way on a vector; i.e., these two su(2) transformations give
the same so(3) transformation. thus su(2) is called a double covering of so(3).
however, this second transformation is not redundant, because it acts dierently on
half-integral spins, which we discuss in the following subsections.

the other convenience of using 22 matrices is that it makes obvious how to
introduce spinors  since a vector already transforms with two factors of u, we
dene a square root of a vector that transforms with just one u:

 = u   = u1

where  is a two-component vector, i.e., a 21 matrix. the complex conjugate of
a spinor then transforms in essentially the same way:

(c*) = cu** = u(c*)

note that the antisymmetry of c implies that  must be complex: we might think
that, since c* transforms in the same way as , we can identify the two consistently
with the transformation law. but then we would have

 = c* = c(c*)* = cc* = 

108

ii. spin

thus the representation is pseudoreal. the fact that c* transforms the same way
under rotations as  leads us to consider the transformation

 = c*

since a vector transforms the same way under rotations as , under this transfor-
mation we have

which identies it as a reection.

v  = cv *c = v

another useful way to write rotations on  (like looking at v c instead of v ) is

(t c) = (t c)u1

this tells us how to take an invariant inner product of spinors:

 = u,  = u  (t c) = (t c)

in other words, c is the metric in the space of spinors. an important dierence of
this inner product from the familiar one for three-vectors is that it is antisymmetric.
thus, if  and  are anticommuting spinors,

t c = t c t  = t c

where one minus sign comes from anticommutativity and another is from the anti-
symmetry of c. thus, it makes sense to take the norm of an anticommuting spinor
as t c, which would vanish if  were commuting. of course, since rotations are
unitary, we also have the usual  as an invariant, positive denite, inner product.

exercise iia3.1

consider a hermitian but not traceless 22 matrix m (m = m, tr m 6= 0).

a show

det m = 0  m =   

for some commuting spinor (column vector)  (and some sign ).

b dene a vector by

v = 2(m  1

2i tr m)

show |v | (not |v |2) is simply .

a. two components

109

4. indices

the best way to discuss general spins is to use index notation, rather than matrix

notation. then a spinor rotates as

with two-valued indices

the inner product is dened by

 = u



 = ,

 = c = 
where we have dened raising and lowering of indices by

 = c,

 = c 

c = c = c  = c  =(cid:0) 0

i i

0(cid:1)

paying careful attention to signs. (in general, we x signs by using a convention of
contracting indices from upper-left to lower-right.) then objects with many indices
transform as the product of spinors:

a... = u

u

...u

a...

an innitesimal transformation is then a sum:

ia... = g

a... + g

a... + ... + g

a...

this is also true for c, even though it is an invariant constant:

c = u

u

c = c det u = c

a more interesting case is the vector: the transformation law is

v  = u

u

v

where v is the symmetric v c considered earlier (in contrast to the antisymmetric
c).

there is basically only one identity in index notation, namely

0 = 1

2c[c] = cc + cc + cc

110

ii. spin

the expression vanishes because it is antisymmetric in those indices, and thus the
indices must all have dierent values, but there are three two-valued indices. another
way to write this identity is to use the denition of c  as the inverse of c:

cc  = 

  cc  = 

[

  


]  



this tells us that antisymmetrizing in any pair of indices automatically contracts
(sums over) them: contracting this identity with an arbitrary tensor a,

a[] = cc a = ca



that means that we need to consider only objects that are totally symmetric in their
free indices. this gives all spins: such a eld with 2s indices describes spin s; we have
already seen spins 0, 1/2, and 1.

we have dened the transformation law of all elds with lower indices by con-
sidering the direct product of spinors. transformations for upper indices follow from
multiplication with c : they all follow from

 = (u1)



since the vertical position of the index indicates the form of the transformation law,
we dene

  ()*

where the 
as

 indicates complex conjugation. thus, a hermitian matrix is written

m

 = (m)

  (m

)*  m



  m = m 

so, for a vector we have

v = v  = v

spin s is usually formulated in terms of a (2s+1)-component vector. then
one needs to calculate clebsch-gordan-wigner coecients to construct hamiltonians
relating dierent spins. for example, to couple two spin-1/2 objects to a spin-1 object,
one might write something like ~v  ~. the matrix elements of the pauli matrices
~ are the cgw coecients for the spin-1 piece of 1
2 = 1  0. this method gets
progressively messier for higher spins. on the other hand, in spinor notation such a
term would be simply v  ; no special coecients are necessary, only contraction
of indices. similarly the decomposition of products of spins involves only the picking
out of the various symmetric and antisymmetric pieces: for example, for 1

2  1

2  1
2,

 = 1

2(() + []) = 1

2()  c = v + cs

a. two components

111

where () means to symmetrize in those indices, by adding all permutations with
plus signs. we have thus explicitly separated out the spin-1 and spin-0 parts v and
s of the product. the square roots of various integers that appear in the cgw
coecients come from permutation factors that appear in the normalizations of the
various elds/wave functions that appear in the products: for example,

a a = |a|2 + 3|a|2 + 3|a|2 + |a|2

in the spinor index method, the square roots never appear explicitly, only their squares
appear in normalizations: for example, in calculating a probability for a  b  c,
we evaluate

ha  b|cihc|a  bi
ha|aihb|bihc|ci

where a, b, and c each have 2s indices for spin s, and h|i means contracting all
indices (with the usual complex conjugation). (normalizing states to other than 1 is
often convenient and sometimes necessary: for example, plane waves are normalized
with  functions.)

exercise iia4.1

redo exercise iia3.1 in index notation: for  above (both now bosonic),
show v v = 2s2.

which we choose to be hermitian,

where we distinguish the right spinor index by a dot because it will be chosen to
transform dierently from the left one: according to our discussion of subsection
ib5, this is the general labeling consistent with hermiticity, i.e., v  = gv g (but
without the extra restriction of group unitarity of the previous subsections). for
comparison, lowering both spinor indices with the matrix c as for su(2), and the

112

ii. spin

vector indices with the minkowski metric (in either the orthonormal or null basis, as
appropriate  see subsection ia4), we nd another hermitian matrix

in the orthonormal basis, a are the pauli matrices and the identity, up to normal-
ization. they are also the clebsch-gordan-wigner coecients for spinorspinor =
vector. in the null basis, they are completely trivial: 1 for one element, 0 for the rest,
the usual basis for matrices. in other words, they are simply an arbitrary way (ac-
cording to choice of basis) to translate a 22 (hermitian) matrix into a 4-component
vector. we will sometimes treat a vector index a as an abbreviation for a spinor

examining the determinant of (either version of) v , we nd the correct minkowski

norms:

2 det v = 2v +v  + 2v tv t* = (v 0)2 + (v 1)2 + (v 2)2 + (v 3)2 = v 2

thus lorentz transformations will be those that preserve the hermiticity of this matrix
and leave its determinant invariant:

v  = gv g,

det g = 1

(det g could also have a phase, but that would cancel in the transformation.) thus g
is an element of sl(2,c). in terms of the representation of the lie algebra,

g = eg,

tr g = 0

thus the group space is 6-dimensional (g has three independent complex compo-
nents), the same as so(3,1) (where ggt =   (g)t = g).

exercise iia5.1

sl(2,c) also can be seen (less conveniently) from vector notation:

a consider the generators

j ()
ab = 1

2 (jab  i 1

2 abcdj cd)

of so(3,1). find their commutation relations, and in particular show
[j (+), j ()] = 0. express j ()

in terms of j ()

. show j ()

a. two components

113

commutation relations as jij. finally, take a general innitesimal lorentz
transformation in terms of jab and rewrite it in terms of j ()
, paying special
ij
attention to the reality properties of the coecients. this demonstrates that
the algebra of so(3,1) is the same as that of su(2)su(2), but wick rotated
to sl(2,c).

b apply the same procedure to so(4) and so(2,2) to derive their covering

groups.

exercise iia5.2

consider relativity in two dimensions (one space, one time):

a show that so(1,1) is represented in lightcone coordinates by

x+ = x+,

x = 1x

for some (nonvanishing) real number , and therefore so(1,1) = gl(1). write
this one lorentz transformation, in analogy to exercise iia1.2a on rotations
in two space dimensions, in terms of an analog of the angle (rapidity) for
those transformations that can be obtained continuously from the identity.
do the relativistic analog of exercise iia2.2.

b still using lightcone coordinates, nd the parity and time reversal transfor-
mations. note that writing  as an exponential, so it can be obtained con-
tinuously from the identity, restricts it to be positive, yielding a subgroup of
gl(1). explicitly, what are the transformations of o(1,1) missing from this
subgroup? which of p, (c)t, and (c)pt are missing from these transforma-
tions, and which are missing from gl(1) itself?

in index notation, we write for this vector

v 


.

g*.


.
v

while for a (weyl) spinor we have

 = g



the metric of the group sl(2,c) is the two-index antisymmetric symbol, which is
also the metric for sp(2,c): in our conventions,

c = c = c  = c .

we also have the identities

these results for so(3,1) = sl(2,c) generalize to so(4) = su(2)su(2) (relevant
to the standard model: see subsection ivb2) and so(2,2) = sl(2)sl(2). as
described earlier, the reality conditions change, so now

so(4) :

(v 

)* = v 

cc,

so(2, 2) :

(v 

)* = v 

consistent with the (pseudo)reality properties of spinors for su(2) and sl(2), where
we now use unprimed and primed indices for the two independent group factors
(v  gv g).

exercise iia5.3

take the explicit 22 representation for a vector given above, change the
factors of i to satisfy the new reality conditions for so(4) and so(2,2), and
show the determinant gives the right signatures for the metrics.

a common example of index manipulation is to use antisymmetry whenever pos-
.
 is antisym-

sible to give vector products. for example, from the fact that v 
metric in  we have that

.
v

where the normalization follows from tracing both sides. similarly,

it then follows that

antisymmetry in vector indices also implies some antisymmetry in spinor indices.
for example, the antisymmetric maxwell eld strength fab = fba, after translating
vector indices into spinor, can be separated into its parts symmetric and antisymmet-
ric in undotted indices; antisymmetry in vector indices (now spinor index pairs) then
implies the opposite symmetry in dotted indices:

thus, an antisymmetric tensor also can be written in terms of a (complex) 22
matrix. (however, our normalization of tensor vs. symmetric spinor matrix will vary
according to application.)

we also need to dene complex (hermitian) conjugates carefully because c is

imaginary, and uses indices consistent with transformation properties:

where we assume the spinor is fermionic (when re-ordering for hermitian conjugation),
and we have used the spacetime coordinates as an example of a real vector (hermitian
.
22 matrix). (sometimes we will drop the  on 
.
note that, unlike su(2),  6= ()*.) in general, hermitian conjugation properties
for any lorentz representation are dened by the corresponding product of spinors:
for example,

., since it is redundant to the

more generally, we nd

(t (1...j)(

k))  (1)j(j1)/2+k(k1)/2 t (1...k)( .1... .j )

as well see later, most spinor algebra involves, besides spinors, just vectors and
antisymmetric tensors, which carry only two spinor indices, so matrix algebra is often
useful. when using bra-ket notation for 2-component spinors, it is often convenient
to distinguish undotted and dotted spinors. furthermore, since spinor indices can
be raised and lowered, we can always choose the bras to carry upper indices and the
kets lower, consistent with our index-contraction conventions, to avoid extra signs
and factors of c. we therefore dene (see subsection ib1)

this transformation thus describes parity (actually cp, because of the complex con-
jugation). in particular, to describe purely cp without any additional rotation (i.e.,
exactly reection of the 3 spatial axes), in our basis we must choose a unit vector in
the time direction,

to describe time reversal, we need a transformation that does not preserve the com-
plex conjugation properties of spinors: for example, cpt is

(the overall sign on v is unambiguous.)

in principle, whenever we work on a problem with both spinors and vectors we
could use a mixed vector-spinor notation, converting between the usual basis for
vectors and the spinor-index basis with identities such as

.


b = b
a,

.


however, in practice its much simpler to use spinor indices exclusively, since then
one needs no -matrix identities at all, but only the trivial identities for the matrix
c that follow from its antisymmetry. for example, converting the vector index on
the  matrices themselves into spinor indices (a  

.
), they become trivial:

(this is the same as saying an orthonormal basis of vectors has the components
(v a)b = a

b when the components are dened with respect to the same basis.)

thus, the most general irreducible (nite-dimensional) representation of sl(2,c)
(and thus so(3,1)) has an arbitrary number of dotted and undotted indices, and is
.
n). treating a vector index directly as a
totally symmetric in each: a(1...m)(

dotted-undotted pair of indices (e.g., a =

a 4-valued index), we can translate into spinor notation the two constant tensors of
so(3,1): since the only constant tensor of sl(2,c) is the antisymmetric symbol, they
can be expressed in terms of it:

when we work with just vectors, these can be expressed in matrix language:

v  w = tr(v w *)

(we have assumed real vectors; for complex vectors we should really write v w * = ...,
etc.)

exercise iia5.5

prove this expression for the  tensor (in either index or matrix version)
agrees with that dened in subsection ib3 (as modied in subsection ib5)
by (1) showing total antisymmetry, (2) explicitly evaluating a nonvanishing
component.

representation in d=4: in terms of two (left and right) two-component spinors,

where the indices have been chosen to insure that the  matrices always take a dirac
spinor to the same type of spinor. since {v/ , w/ } = v  w , the  matrices satisfy

{a, b} = ab

the extra sign is the result of normalizing the s to be pseudohermitian with respect
to the metric:   1 = +. this dirac spinor can be made irreducible by imposing
a reality condition that relates l and r: the resulting majorana spinor is then

 = 12(cid:18) 
 .(cid:19)

the product of all the s is a pseudoscalar, and an additional -matrix:

 {1, a} = 0,

(this is usually called 5 in the literature for d = 4, or d for d 6= 4. we have
renamed it for consistency with dimensional reduction.) it can be used to project a
dirac or majorana spinor onto its two two-component spinors:

various identities for these matrices can be derived directly from the anticommu-

tation relations: for example,

aa = 2,

aa/a = a/,

aa/b/a = a  b,

aa/b/c/a = c/b/a/

tr(i) = 4,

tr(a/b/) = 2a  b,

tr(a/b/c/d/) = a  b c  d + a  d b  c  a  c b  d

the trace identities follow from the fact that the only way to get a nonvanishing trace
out of a product of  matrices is when there are terms proportional to the identity;
since {a, b} = ab, this only happens when the indices are pairwise identical. the
above results then follow from examination of relevant special cases. (traces of odd
numbers of  matrices vanish. an exception is 1, until it is rewritten in terms of
its denition as the product of the other -matrices.)

although use of the anticommutation relations is convenient for generalization of
such identities to arbitrary dimensions, 2-spinor bra-ket notation is easier for deriving
4d identities. since a dirac spinor is the direct sum of a weyl spinor and its complex
conjugate, we write

 = |il + |

.] r .,

 = 

.
rh| + 
l[ .|

in this notation, there is no need to use a spinor metric  , just as in minkowski
4-vector bra-ket notation there is no need for an explicit matrix to represent the
minkowski metric: it is included implicitly in the denition of the inner product
for the basis elements (ha|bi = ab or h|i = c). thus hermitian conjugation is
automatically pseudohermitian conjugation, etc.:  is  , from the eect of hermitian
conjugating the basis vectors along with the components of the spinors they multiply.

so(3,2) (subsection ic5).

7. chirality/duality

 are often called chiral projectors; 2-component spinors (not paired into
dirac spinors) are often called chiral spinors, and appear in chiral theories; the
two 2-component spinors of a dirac spinor are often labeled as having left and right
chirality; etc. when these two halves decouple, a theory can have a chiral sym-
metry

 = ei

since chirality is closely related to parity (chiral spinors can represent cp, but need to
be doubled to allow c, and thus p), dirac spinors are often used to describe theories
where parity is preserved, or softly broken, or to analyze parity violation specically,
using 1 to identify it.

a similar feature appears in electrodynamics. we rst translate the theory into
spinor notation: the maxwell eld strength fab is expressed in terms of the vector po-
tential (gauge eld) aa, with a gauge invariance in terms of a gauge parameter
 with spacetime dependence. the gauge transformation aa = a becomes

exercise iia7.2

write maxwells equations, and the expression for the eld strength in terms
of the gauge vector, in 22 matrix notation, without using cs. combine
them to derive the wave equation for a.

maxwells equations now can be easily generalized to include magnetic charge by
allowing the current j to be complex. (however, the expression for f in terms of a is
no longer valid.) this is because the duality transformation that switches electric
and magnetic elds is much simpler in spinor notation: using the expression given
above for the 4d levi-civita tensor using spinor indices,

f ab = 1

2abcdf cd  f = if

more generally, maxwells equations in free space (but not the expression for f in
terms of a) are invariant under the continuous duality transformation

exercise iia7.4

how does complexifying j

 modify maxwells equations in vector notation?
in even time dimensions, wick rotation kills the i (or i) in the spinor-index
expression for ,,,. since the (discrete and continuous) duality transformation
now contains no i, we can impose self-duality or anti-self-duality; i.e., that f or f
vanishes, since they are now independent and real instead of complex conjugates.

these continuous chirality and duality symmetries on the eld strengths generalize
to the free eld equations for arbitrary massless elds in four dimensions. for reasons
to be explained in the following section, they distinguish the two polarizations of the
waves described by such elds. they are closely related to conformal invariance: in
higher dimensions, where not all free, massless theories are conformal (even on the
mass shell), these symmetries exist exactly for those that are conformal.

the general procedure for nding arbitrary representations of the poincare group

relevant to physics is to:

(1) describe spin 0. as we have seen, this means starting with the coordinate rep-
resentation, which is reducible, and apply the constraint p2 + m2 = 0 to get an
irreducible one.

(2) find arbitrary, nite-dimensional,

irreducible representations of the lorentz

group. this we have done in the previous section.

(3) take the direct product of these two representations of the poincare group, which
give the orbital and spin parts of the generators. (the spin part of translations
vanishes.) we then need a further constraint to pick out an irreducible unitary
piece of this product, which is the subject of this section.

1. field equations

we have already constrained the momentum: the equation

p2 + m2 = 0

as an operator equation acting on a eld or wave function is the klein-gordon (or
relativistic schrodinger) equation. states or elds that satisfy their eld equations
are called on-(mass-)shell, while those that dont (or for which the equations havent
been imposed) are o-shell.

the next step is to constrain the spin (actually, its lorentz generalization).
the basic idea of the extra constraint is very simple: the lorentz group introduces
states of negative probability, since the minkowski space metric is indenite. for
example, if we write the naive lorentz invariant hilbert-space norm for a vector wave
function, the time component will have negative probability. (similar remarks apply
to spinors, e.g., for the metric   0 for the dirac spinor.) the solution to this
problem, in rst-quantized operator language, is to constrain the spin to eliminate
the negative-metric component, in analogy to the way we have already constrained
the momentum by the klein-gordon equation. we thus impose

sa

bpb + wpa = 0

to kill the part of the lorentz generators in the direction of the momentum, where w
is a constant to be determined. (its term can be attributed to ordering ambiguities.)

124

ii. spin

this equation is the general eld equation for all spins (acting on the eld strength),
in addition to the klein-gordon equation (which is redundant except for spin 0).

we will see that this constraint is appropriate for massless particles. massive
particles then follow from dimensional reduction: adding a further spatial dimension
and xing its component of momentum to a constant, the mass, so p2  p2 + m2.

before examining this constraint, we rst give an alternative derivation based
on the conformal group. the earlier derivation of the massless particle from the con-
formal particle for spin 0 can be generalized to all spins, i.e., all representations of
the poincare group in arbitrary dimensions. there is a way to do this in terms of
classical mechanics for all representations of the conformal group, by generalizing the
description of the classical spinning particle. however, by analyzing the conformal
particle quantum mechanically instead, applying a set of constraints, it will be clear
how to generalize from conformal particles to general massless particles by weakening
the constraints. the general idea is that the symmetry group for massive particles is
the poincare group, while that for massless particles includes also scale transforma-
tions, and nally conformal particles have also conformal boosts. so, starting with
the conformal group and dropping anything to do with conformal boosts will give
massless particles.

we begin with a general representation of the conformal group so(d,2) in terms
of generators gab, where a, b are d+2-component vector indices. we then impose
constraints that are the conformally covariant form of p2 = 0: identifying

(g+a, gab, g+, ga) = (p a, j ab, , k a)

(where a = (, a)) as the generators for translations, lorentz transformations, di-
latations, and conformal boosts, we see that

gab = 1

2gc(agc

b)  1

d+2abgcdgcd = 0

is an irreducible piece of the product gg (symmetric and traceless) and includes:

(g++,g+a,gab,g+,ga,g) = (p 2, 1

2{j ab, pb} + 1

2{, p a}, ...)

where ... all have terms containing k a.

exercise iib1.1

work out all the gs in terms of p , j, , and k.

in general theories, even massless ones, it is not always possible to have invariance
under conformal boosts. (well see examples of this insubsection ixa7.) however, all

b. poincare

125

massless theories are scale invariant, at least at the free level. (in d=4, free massless
theories can always be made conformal on shell. however, the fact that even these
theories can have actions that are not invariant under conformal boosts proves that it
is sucient to add just dilatations to the poincare group. furthermore, the fact that
conformal boosts are not always an invariance in d>4 means that dropping them will
give results in a dimension-independent form.) therefore, only g++ and g+a can be
dened in general massless theories, but well see that these are sucient to dene
the kinematics. the former is just the masslessness condition, which we used to pick
the constraints in the rst place.

as we saw earlier,  just scales xa: we can therefore write the relevant generators

as

p a = a,

j ab = x[ab] + sab,

 = 1

2{xa, a} + w  1 = xaa + w + d2

2

2

(we have used the antihermitian form of the generators.) the scale weight w + d2
is the real spin part of , just as sab is the spin part of the angular momentum
jab. to preserve the algebra it must commute with everything, and thus we can
set it equal to a constant on an irreducible representation. well see shortly that
its value is actually determined by the spin sab. it is the engineering dimension of
the corresponding eld. it has been normalized for later convenience; the value of
w depends on the representation of sab, but is independent of d. the dilatation
generator  is not exactly antihermitian because the integration measure ddx isnt
invariant under scaling. this is another reason w is determined, by the free action.
the form we have given preserves reality of elds. the commutation relations for the
spin parts, and the total generators, are the same as those for the orbital parts; e.g.,

[sab, scd] = [c

[asb]

d]

(a convenient mnemonic for evaluating this commutator in general is to use sab 
x[ab] instead.)

exercise iib1.2

we can also use this method to nd the stronger conditions for the fully
conformal case:

a find an expression for k a in terms of x, , s, and w that preserves the

commutation relations.

b evaluate all the constraints g, and express the independent ones in terms of

just , s, and w (no x).

126

ii. spin

substituting the explicit representation of the generators into the constraint g+a,
and using the former constraint p 2 = 0 (when acting on wave functions on the right),
we nd that all x dependence drops out, leaving for g+a the condition

sa

bb + wa = 0

(paying careful attention to quantum mechanical ordering).

exercise iib1.3

dene spin for the conformal group by starting in d+2 dimensions: in terms
of the (d+2)-dimensional coordinates ya and their derivatives a,

gab = y[ab] + sab

besides the previous conditions

y2 = 2 = {ya, a} = 0

impose the constraints, in analogy to the d-dimensional eld equations, and
taking into account the symmetry between y and ,

b solve all the constraints with explicit ys for everything with an upper 
index, reducing the manifest symmetry to so(d1,1), in analogy to the way
y2 = 0 was solved to nd y.

c write all the conformal generators in terms of xa, a, sab, and w.

2. examples

we now examine the constraints sa

bb + wa = 0 in more detail. we begin by

looking at some simple (but useful) examples. the simplest case is spin 0:

sab = 0  w = 0

the next simplest case (for arbitrary dimension) is the dirac spinor (see subsections
ic1 and iia6):

sab =  1

2 [a, b]  sa

bb + wa = abb + (w  1

2)a

b. poincare

127

 aa = 0, w = 1

2

where we have separated out the pieces of the constraint that are irreducible with
respect to the lorentz group (e.g., by multiplying on the left with a). this gives
the (massless) dirac equation / = 0. the next case is the vector: in terms of the
basis |v i = v a|ai, the spin is (see subsection ib5)
sab = |[aihb]|

however, the vector yields just another description of the scalar:

exercise iib2.1

apply the eld equations for general eld strengths to the case of a vector
eld strength.

a find the independent eld equations (assuming the eld strength is not just

a constant)

[afb] = 0,

afa = 0,

w = 1

note that solving the rst equation determines the vector in terms of a scalar,
while the second then gives the klein-gordon equation for that scalar, and
the third xes the weight of the scalar to be the same as that found by starting
with a scalar eld strength.

b lorentz covariantly solve the second equation rst to nd a gauge eld that

is not a scalar.

all other representations can be built up from the spinor and vector. as our nal
example, we consider the case where the eld is a 2nd-rank antisymmetric tensor:
using the direct product representation (applied as in subsection ib2 given the vector
representation)

f = f ab|ai  |bi, sab(|ci  |di) = (sab|ci)  |di + |ci  sab|di

 (sabf )cd = [c

which are maxwells equations, again separating out irreducible pieces (e.g., by tracing
and antisymmetrizing).

stant. note that we chose the eld strength fab to describe electromagnetism: the
arguments we used to derive eld equations were based on physical degrees of free-

dom, and did not take gauge invariance into account. in chapter xii we use more

powerful methods to nd the gauge covariant eld equations for the gauge elds, and

their actions.

3. solution

free eld equations can be solved easily in momentum space. then the simplest
way to do the algebra is in the lightcone frame. this is a reference frame, obtained
by a lorentz transformation, where a massless momentum takes the simple form

pa = a

+p+

(using only rotations), or the even simpler form pa = a
boost), where again  is the sign of the energy.
equation sa

bb + wa = 0 reduces to

+ (using also a lorentz
in that frame the general eld

si = 0,

w = s+

the constraint si = 0 determines s+ to take its maximum possible value within
that irreducible representation, since si is the raising operators for s+: for any
eigenstate of s+,

s+|hi = h|hi  s+(si|hi) = (sis+ + [s+, si])|hi = (h + 1)(si|hi)
the remaining constraint then determines w: it is the maximum value of s+ for
that representation. by parity (+  ), w is the minimum, so

w  0;

w = 0  sab = 0

since if s+ = 0 for all states then sab = 0 by lorentz transformation. as we have
seen by other methods (but can easily be derived by this method), w = 1
2 for the
dirac spinor and w = 1 for the vector; since general representations can be built from
reducing direct products of these, we see that w is an integer for bosons and half-
integer for fermions. if we describe a general irreducible representation by a young
tableau for so(d1,1) (with tracelessness imposed), or a young tableau times a
spinor (with also -tracelessness aa...b = 0), then it is easy to see from the results
for the spinor and vector, and antisymmetry in rows, that w is simply the number
of columns of the tableau (its width), counting a spinor index as half a column:
s+ just counts the maximum number of  indices that can be stuck in the boxes
(in fact, dirac spinor  dirac spinor gives just all
describing the basis elements.
possible 1-column representations.)

this leaves undetermined only sij and s+i. however, s+i (creation operator)
is canonically conjugate to si (annihilation operator), so its action has also been
xed:

[si, s+j] = ijs+ + sij

130

ii. spin

(sij vanishes for i = j, so s+i and si are conjugate, though not orthonormal. the
constant s+ was xed above to be nonvanishing, except for the trivial case of spin
0.) equivalently, sij preserves si = 0, while s+i doesnt: sij are the only nontrivial
spin operators acting within the subspace satisfying the constraint.

thus only the little group so(d2) spin sij remains nontrivial: the original
irreducible representation of so(d1,1) lorentz spin sab was a reducible representa-
tion of so(d2) spin sij; the irreducible so(d2) representation with the highest
value of s+ is picked out of this so(d1,1) representation. this solution also gives
the eld strength in terms of the gauge eld: working with just the highest-s+-
weight states is equivalent to working with the gauge eld, up to factors of +.

as an explicit example, for spin 1/2 we have simply  = 0, which kills half the

components, leaving the half given by + . for spin 1, we nd

pbfab = 0  f a = 0

p[af bc] = 0  only f +a 6= 0 (cid:27)  only f +i 6= 0

in the lightcone gauge a+ = 0, we have f +i = +ai, so the highest-weight part of
f ab is the transverse part of the gauge eld. the general pattern, in terms of eld
strengths, is then to keep only pieces with as many as possible upper + indices and
no upper  indices (and thus highest s+ weight). in terms of the vector potential,
we have

f ab  p[aab]  only ai 6= 0

the general rule for the gauge eld is to drop  indices, so the eld becomes an
irreducible representation of so(d2). all + indices on the eld strength are picked
up by the momenta, which also account for the scale weight of the eld strength: all
gauge elds have w = 0 for bosons and w = 1

2 for fermions.

exercise iib3.1

using only the anticommutation relations {a, b} = ab, construct projec-
tion operators from : these are operators i that satisfy

ij = ij i (cid:16)no x(cid:17) , x i = 1

because of time reversal symmetry +   (or parity +  ), these
project onto two subspaces equal in size.

a method equivalent to using the lightcone frame is to perform a unitary trans-
formation u on the spin that is the inverse of the transformation on the coordi-
nates/momentum that would take us to the lightcone frame: we want a lorentz

if |i satises the original constraint, then u|i will satisfy the new one. if we like,
we can always transform back at the end. this is equivalent to a gauge transformation
in the eld theory.

it is easy to check that the appropriate operator is

u = es+ipi/p+

any operator v a that transforms as a vector under sab,

[sab, v c] = v [ab]c

but commutes with p, is transformed by u into uv u1 = v  as
v  = v  + v i pi

v + = v +,

v i = v i + v + pi
p+ ,

p+ + v + (pi)2

2(p+)2

as follows from explicit taylor expansion, which terminates because s+i act as low-
ering operators (as for conformal boosts in subsection ia6). this yields the desired
result

v apa = v apa +

when we impose the eld equation p2 = 0.

exercise iib3.2

v +
2p+ p2

check this result by performing the transformation explicitly on the con-
straint. before the transformation, the lightcone decomposition of the con-
straint is

(s+ + w)p+ + s+ipi = 0

sip+ + sijpj + wpi  si+p = 0

sipi + (s+ + w)p = 0

show that after this transformation, the constraint becomes

(s+ + w)p+ = 0

clearly these imply

with p2 = 0.

w = s+,

si = 0

on the other hand, if instead of using the lightcone identication of x+ as time,
we choose to use the usual x0 for purposes of nding the evolution of the system, then
we want to consider transformations that do not involve p0, instead of not involving
the energy p. thus, by p0-independent rotations alone, the best we can do is to
choose

pi = 0,

p1 = 

i.e., we can x the value of the spatial momentum, but not in a way that relates to
the sign of the energy. the result is then

p0 > 0 : pa = a
p0 < 0 : pa = a

+p+
p

the result is similar to before, but now the positive and negative energy solutions are
separated: in this frame the eld equations reduce to

p0 > 0 : si = 0, s+ = w
p0 < 0 : s+i = 0, s+ = w

thus, while w takes the same value as before, now the positive-energy states are
associated with the highest weight of s+, while the negative-energy ones go with
the lowest weight (and nothing between). the unitary transformation that achieves
this result is a spin rotation that rotates sab in the eld equations with the same
eect as an orbital transformation that would rotate (p1, pi)  (, 0). by looking at
the special case d = 3 (where there is only one rotation generator), we easily nd
the explicit transformation

u = exp(cid:20)tan1(cid:18)|pi|

so far we have considered only massless theories. we now introduce masses
by dimensional reduction, identifying mass with the component of momentum in
an extra dimension. as with the extra dimensions used for describing conformal
symmetry, this extra dimension is just a mathematical construct used to give a simple
derivation. (theories have been postulated with extra, unseen dimensions that are
hidden by compactication: space curls up in those directions to a size too small
to detect with present experiments. however, no compelling reason has been given
for why the extra dimensions should want to compactify.)

the method is to:

(1) extend the range of vector indices by one additional spatial direction, which we

call 1;

(2) set the corresponding component of momentum to equal the mass,

p1 = m

134

and

ii. spin

(3) introduce extra factors of i to restore reality, since 1 = ip1 = im, by a unitary

transformation.

since all representations can be constructed by direct products of the vector and
spinor, its sucient to dene this last step on them. for the scalar this method is
trivial, since then simply p2  p2 + m2. except for the last step, the other constraint
becomes

sa

bb + sa,1im + wa = 0,

s1

aa + wim = 0

for the spinor, since any transformation on the spinor index can be written in
terms of the gamma matrices, and the transformation must aect only the 1 direc-
tion, we can use only 1. (for even dimensions, we can identify the 1 of dimen-
sional reduction with the one coming from the product of all the other s, since in
odd dimensions the product of all the s is proportional to the identity.) we nd

u = exp(1/22) :

1  1,

a  

21a

we perform this transformation directly on the spin operators appearing in the con-
straints, or the inverse transformation on the states. dimensional reduction, followed
by this transformation, then modies the massless equation of motion as

i/  i/  m1  
) = 0.

21(i/ + m2

)

so i/ = 0  (i/ + m2

the prescription for the vector is

u = exp( 1

2 i|1ih1|) :

|1i  i|1i,

h1|  ih1|

(h1|1i = 1)

with the other basis states unchanged. this has the eect of giving each eld a i
for each (1)-index. for example, for maxwells equations

note that only the mass-independent equations are redundant. also, fa1 appears
explicitly as the potential for fab, but without gauge invariance. alternatively, we
can keep the gauge potential:

fab = [aab] (cid:26) fab = [aab]

fa1 = aa1  imaa (cid:26) fab = [aab]

ifa1 = i(aa1 + maa)

[afbc] (cid:26) [afbc]

this is known as the stuckelberg formalism for a massive vector, which maintains
gauge invariance by having a scalar a1 in addition to the vector: the gauge trans-
formations are now

aa = a (cid:26) aa = a

a1 = im (cid:26) aa = a

ia1 = im

exercise iib4.1

consider the general massive eld equations that follow from the general
massless ones by dimensional reduction. one of these is

aa + wim = 0

(before restoring reality). this scalar equation alone gives the complete eld
equations for w=1/2 and 1 (antisymmetric tensors), 0 being trivial.

a show that for w=1/2 it gives the (massive) dirac equation.

b expanding the state over explicit elds, nd the covariant eld equations it
implies for w=1. show these are sucient to describe spins 0 (vector eld
strength: see exercise iib2.1) and 1 (fab and fa1). note that s1a act as
generalized  matrices (the dirac matrices for spin 1/2, the dun-kemmer
matrices for w=1), where

sab = [s1a, s1b]

c show that these covariant eld equations imply the klein-gordon equation
for arbitrary antisymmetric tensors. show that in d=4 all antisymmetric
tensors (coming from 0-5 indices in d=5) are equivalent to either spin 0 or
spin 1, or trivial. (hint: use abcd.)

d consider the reducible representation coming from the direct product of two

dirac spinors, and represent the wave function itself as a matrix:

sij = sij +  sij

where i = (1, a) and sij is the usual dirac-spinor representation. using the
fact that any 44 (in d=4) matrix can be written as a linear combination of
products of -matrices (antisymmetric products, since symmetrization yields
anticommutators), nd the irreducible representations of so(4,1) in  , and
relate to part c.

exercise iib4.2

solve the eld equations for massive spins 1/2 and 1 in momentum space by
going to the rest frame.

136

ii. spin

the solution to the general massive eld equations can also be found by going to
the rest frame (p0 = m): the combination of that and dimensional reduction is, in
terms of the massive analog of lightcone components,

p+ = 12

(p0 + p1) = 2m,

p = 12

(p0  p1) = 0,

pi = 0

where pi are now the other d1 (spatial) components. this xing of the momentum
is the same as the lightcone frame except that p1 has been replaced by p1, and
thus pi now has d1 components instead of d2. the solution to the constraints is
thus also the same, except that we are left with an irreducible representation of the
little group so(d1) as found in the rest frame for the massive particle, vs. one
of so(d2) found in the lightcone frame for the massless case.

5. foldy-wouthuysen

the other frame we used for the massless analysis, which involved only energy-
independent rotations, can also be applied to the massive case by dimensional reduc-
tion. the result is known as the foldy-wouthuysen transformation, and is useful for
analyzing interacting massive eld equations in the nonrelativistic limit. replacing
p1  p1 = m in our previous result, we have for the free case
uhu1 = 1

u = exp(cid:20)tan1(cid:18)|~p|

m(cid:19) s1i pi
|~p|(cid:21) ,

w s10

for purposes of generalization to interactions, it was important that in the free trans-
formation (1) we used only the spin part of a rotation, since the orbital part could
introduce explicit x dependence, and (2) we used only rotations, since a lorentz
boost would introduce p0 dependence in the parameters of the transformation,
which could generate additional p0 (time derivative) terms in the eld equation.

exercise iib5.1

perform this transformation for the dirac spinor, and then apply the reality-
restoring transformation to obtain

we then can use the diagonal representation 0 =(cid:0) i

ne this representation, up to phases, by switching 0 and 1 of the usual
representation.) in general the reality-restoring transformation will be unnec-
essary for any spin, since applying the eld equation s10 = w picks out a
representation of the little group so(d1).

in the interacting case the result generally cant be obtained in closed form, so it is
derived perturbatively in 1/m. the goal is again a hamiltonian diagonal with respect
to s10, to preserve the separation of positive and negative energies; we then can set
s10 = w to describe just positive energies. we thus choose the transformation to
cancel any terms in h that are o-diagonal, which come from odd total numbers of
i.e., odd numbers of s0i
1 and 0 indices from the spin factors in any term:
and s1i (e.g., the s0ipi term in the original h). for example, for coupling to an
electromagnetic eld, the exponent of u is generalized by covariantizing derivatives
(minimal coupling    =  + ia), but also requires eld-strength (e and b) terms
to cancel certain ones of those generated from commutators of these derivatives in
the transformation:

a = a + iaa  [a,b] = if ab

before performing this transformation explicitly for the rst few orders, we con-
sider some general properties that will allow us to collect similar terms in advance.
(few duplicate terms would appear to the order we consider, but they breed like
rabbits at higher orders.) we start with a eld equation f that can be separated into
even terms e and odd ones o, each of which can be expanded in powers of 1/m:

f = e + o :

e =

xn=1

mnen,

o =

xn=0

mnon

note that the leading (m+1) term is even; thus we choose only odd generators to
transform away the odd terms in f , perturbatively from this leading term:

f = egf eg,

g =

mngn

xn=1

since f is even while g is odd, we can separate this equation into its even and odd
parts as

f = cosh(lg)e + sinh(lg)o
0 = sinh(lg)e + cosh(lg)o

(with lg = [g,
] as in subsection ia3). since we can perturbatively invert any
taylor-expandable function of lg that begins with 1, we can use the second equation
to give a recursion relation for gn: separating the leading term of f ,

e = me1 + e,

m[g,e1] = [g, e] + lg coth(lg)o

138

ii. spin

which we can expand in 1/m [after taylor expanding lg coth(lg)] to give an expres-
sion for [gn,e1] to solve for gn. we can also use the implicit solution for [g,e]
directly to simplify the expression for f:

f = e + tanh( 1

2lg)o

for example, to order 1/m2 we have for f
f0 = e0,

f
1 = e1,

f2 = e2 + 1
to this order we therefore need to solve

2[g2,o0] + 1

2[g1,o0]

f1 = e1 + 1
2 [g1,o1]

[g1,e1] = o0,

[g2,e1] = o1 + [g1,e0]

for our applications we will always have

e1 =  1

w s10

unchanged by interactions. we have oversimplied things a bit in the above deriva-
tion: for general spin we need to consider more than just even and odd terms; we
need to consider all eigenvalues of s10:

[s10,fs] = sfs

and nd the transformation that makes f commute with it (s = 0). the procedure
is to rst divide into even and odd values of s, as above, then to divide the remaining
even terms in f into twice even values of s (multiples of 4) as the new e and twice
odd as the new o, which are transformed away with the new twice odd g, and so
on. this very rapidly removes the lower nonzero values of |s| (1  2  4  ...),
which has a maximum value of 2w (from the operators that mix the maximum value
s10 = w with the minimum s10 = w). for example, for the case of most interest,
the dirac spinor, the only eigenvalues (for operators) are 0 and 1, so the original
even part does commute with s10, and the procedure need be applied only once.
furthermore, terms in f of eigenvalue s can be generated only at order m1s or
higher; so at any given order the procedure rapidly removes all undesired terms for
any spin.

since the terms we want to cancel are exactly the ones with nonvanishing eigen-
values of s10, they can always be written as [g, s10] for some g, so we can always
nd a transformation to eliminate them:

[s10, gsn] = sgsn  gsn =  w

s {[g, e] + lg coth(lg)o}sn

b. poincare

139

(this is just diagonalization of a hermitian matrix in operator language.) in partic-
ular for the dirac spinor, since e1 has only 1 eigenvalues, its easy to see that not
only do all even operators commute with it, but all odd operators anticommute with

it. (consider the diagonal representation of e1: {(cid:0) 1

simply

0

0

1(cid:1) ,(cid:0) 0

a

b

0(cid:1)} = 0.) we then have

w = 1

2  (e1)2 = 1  [e1, e] = {e1,o} = {e1, g} = 0

 mg =  1

2{[g, e] + lg coth(lg)o}e1

as a nal step, we can apply the usual transformation

u0 = eimts10/w

which commutes with all but the p0 term in e0 to have the sole eect of canceling
e1, eliminating the rest-mass term from the nonrelativistic-style expression for the
energy.

for the minimal electromagnetic coupling described above, we have besides e1

e0 = 0,

o0 = 1

w s0ii

where we have written a = pa + aa (instead of a = ia, to save some is). there
are no additional terms in f for minimal coupling for spin 1/2, but later well need to
include nonminimal eective couplings coming from quantum (eld theoretic) eects.
there are also extra terms for spins 0 and 1 because the eld strength is not the same
as the fundamental eld, so well treat only spin 1/2 here, but well continue to use
the general notation to illustrate the procedure. using the above results, we nd to
order 1/m2 for f

g1 = s1ii,

g2 = ws0iif 0i

in agreement with with the free case up to eld strength terms. the diagonalized
schrodinger equation is then to this order, including the eect of u0,

f
1 = 0,

f1 =  1

2w [ 1

2{s1i, s0j}if ij + s10(i)2]

f0 = 0,
f2 =  1

4[{s0i, s0j}(if 0j)  sij{if 0i, j}]

for spin 1/2 we are done, but for other spins we would need a further transformation
(before u0) to pick out the part of f2 that commutes with s10 (by eliminating the
twice odd part); the nal result is

f2 = 1
2({s1i, s1j}  {s0i, s0j})(if 0j) + sij{if 0i, j}]
4[ 1

140

ii. spin

it can also be convenient to translate into  notation (as for the massless case, but
with index 1  1): we then write

f
1 = 0,

f0 = 0,
f2 =  1
2{s+(i, sj)}(if 0j)  sij{if 0i, j}]
4 [ 1

f1 =  1

2{s+i, sj}if ij + s+(i)2]

in this notation the eigenvalue of s+ = s10 for any combination of spin operators
can be simply read o as the number of  indices minus the number of +.

6. twistors

besides describing spin 1/2, spinors provide a convenient way to solve the condi-
tion p2 = 0 covariantly: any hermitian matrix with vanishing determinant must have
a zero eigenvalue (consider the diagonalized matrix), and so such a 22 matrix can
be simply expressed in terms of its other eigenvector. absorbing all but the sign of
the nontrivial eigenvalue into the normalization of the eigenvector, we have

.
 = pp

.


p2 = 0  p
.  (p)*). since p0 is the (canonical) energy, the 

for some spinor p (where p
is the sign of the energy. this explains why time reversal (actually ct in the usual
terminology) is not a linear transformation. note that p is a commuting object, while
most spinors are fermionic, and thus anticommuting (at least in quantum theory).
such commuting spinors are called twistors.

exercise iib6.1

show that, in terms of its energy e and the angular direction (, ) (with
respect to the 1 axis) of its velocity, a massless particle is described by the
twistor

p = 21/4p|e|(cos 

2ei/2, sin 

2 ei/2)

b. poincare

141

one useful way to think of twistors is in terms of the lightcone frame. in spinor

notation, the momentum is

p

.

 = (cid:0) 1

0

0

0(cid:1)

if we write an arbitrary massless momentum as a lorentz transformation from this
lightcone frame, then the twistor is just the part of the sl(2,c) matrix that con-
tributes:

.
 = p

.
g

p

g.


.
.
 = 
.



g

g.


.
 = g

g .


.
 = pp

.


for this reason, the twistor formalism can be understood as a lorentz covariant form
of the lightcone formalism.

the twistor construction thus gives a covariant way of constructing wave functions
satisfying the mass-shell condition (klein-gordon equation) for the massless case,
= 2 = p2. we simply fourier transform, and use the twistor
expression for the momentum, writing the momentum-space wave function in terms
of twistor variables (penrose transform):

 = 0, where

(x) =z d2pd2 p .[exp(ix

.
p p.

)+(p, p .) + exp(ix

.
p p.

)(p, p .)]

where  describe the positive- and negative-energy states, respectively. (the integral
over p . can be performed also, eectively taking the fourier transform with respect
to that variable only, treating x

.
p as the conjugate.)

we can extend the matrix notation of subsection iia5-6 to twistors:

hp| = ph|,

|pi = |ip;
p = |pi[p|,

as a result, we also have for twistors

.[ .|,

[p| = p
 p * = |p]hp|

|p] = |

.]p .

hpqi =  hqpi,

[pq] = [qp];

hpqi* = [qp]

hpqihrsi + hqrihpsi + hrpihqsi = 0

these properties do not apply to physical, anticommuting spinors, where hi =
+hi, and hi 6= 0.

another natural way to understand twistors is through the conformal group. we
have already seen that the conformal group in d dimensions is so(d,2). since this
group in four dimensions is the same as su(2,2), its simpler to describe its general
representations (and in particular spinors) in su(2,2) spinor notation. then the
simplest way to generate representations of this group is to use spinor coordinates:
we therefore write the generators as (see subsection ic1)

gab = b a  1

ac c
4b

142

ii. spin

where we have subtracted out the trace piece to reduce u(2,2) to su(2,2) and, consis-
tently with the group transformation properties under complex conjugation, we have
chosen the complex conjugate of the spinor to also be the canonical conjugate: the
poisson bracket is dened by

[a, b] = b
a

to compare with four-dimensional notation, we reduce this four-component spinor by
recognizing it as a particular use of the dirac spinor. using the same representation
as in subsection iia6, we write

a = (p, 

.),

a = (, p .);



.

ab =(cid:18) 0

c 

c

.
.


0 (cid:19)

now the poisson brackets are

the group generators themselves reduce to

p( . .
),

p + p

.  .  2

(for e > 0, with an overall  for e < 0), which are translations, conformal boosts,
sl(2,c) generators and their complex conjugates, and dilatations.

another kind of twistor, related to position space instead of momentum space,
follows from this (d+2)-coordinate description of conformal symmetry for d=4 (see
subsection ia6). in practice, its more convenient to work with invariances than con-
straints. in this case, we can solve the lightcone constraint on wick-rotated d=3+3
or 5+1 space, replacing 6-component conformal vector indices with 4-component con-
formal spinor indices, with a position-space twistor:

y2 = 1

4 abcdyabycd = 0  yab = zazb 

where a is an sl(4) (or su*(4)) index and  is an sl(2) (or su(2)) index, and za
is real (with either two real or two pseudoreal indices). (here the sl groups apply
to 3+3 dimensions, the su groups to 5+1.) whereas y had 6  1 = 5 components
due to the constraint, z has 4 2 3 = 5 components due to the sl(2) (su(2)) gauge
invariance of the above relation to y. these coordinates reduce to the usual by an
sl(2) transformation:

7. helicity

a sometimes-useful way to treat the transverse spin operators sij is in terms of

wabc = 1

2 p[ajbc] = 1

2 p[asbc]

which reduces to sij in the rest frame, and (like the eld equations) can be written
in terms of just the poincare generators. this is the part of sab whose commutator
with the eld equations is proportional to the eld equations (i.e., it preserves the
constraints). in d=4 this is the pauli-lubanski (axial) vector

wa = 1

6 w bcdbcda

we can choose our states to be eigenstates of a component of it: for example, for
massless states w 0/p 0 is called the helicity. for massive states the helicity is
dened as w 0/| ~p|, but is less useful, especially since it is undened (0/0) in the rest
in that case one instead chooses a component in terms of a (momentum-
frame.

exercise iib7.1

show in both the massless and massive cases that wabc reduces to the little
group generators on shell by going to the appropriate reference frame.

the twistor representation of the conformal group does not give the most general
representation, but it does give all the (free) massless ones. the reason it gives
massless ones is that this representation satises the constraint (see subsection iib1)

g[ab]

[cd] = g[a

[cgb]d]  traces = 0

which includes p2 = 0 as well as all the equations that follow from p2 = 0 by conformal
transformations. as a consequence, this representation also satises

gacgcb  trace = hgab

where h is the helicity. this equation may be more recognizable in so(4,2) notation,
as

this equation includes, as its lowest mass-dimension part (as dened by dilatations),

ii. spin

(the i appears in the last two equations only when we use the antihermitian form of
the generators gab and jab.) although any massless representation of the conformal
group satises the above conditions (see exercise iib2.3), the twistor representation
satises the unusual property that helicity is realized as a linear transformation on the
coordinates: for the twistors the implicit denition of helicity can be solved explicitly
to give

h = 1

4{a, a} = 1

2

aa + 1 = 1

2(p  p

.  .)

(also for e > 0), which is exactly the u(1) transformation of u(2,2)=su(2,2)u(1).
(this is similar to su(2) in terms of twistors: see exercise ic1.1.) on functions of
p and p ., it eectively just counts half the number of ps minus p .s.

exercise iib7.2

these results are pretty clear from symmetry, but we should do some algebra
to check coecients: express jab and pa in terms of the twistors p, p ., ,  .
(see also exercise iib2.3 for normalization), and plug into p j = ihp to derive
the above expression of h in terms of twistors.

the simple form of the helicity in the twistor formalism is another consequence
of it being a covariantized lightcone formalism. in the lightcone frame, there is still
a residual lorentz invariance; in particular, a rotation about the spatial direction in
which the momentum points leaves the momentum invariant. this is another deni-
tion of the helicity, as the part of the angular momentum performing that rotation.
(only spin contributes, since by denition the momentum is not rotated.) since the
product of two lorentz transformations is another one, this rotation can be inter-
preted as a transformation acting on the lorentz transformation to the lightcone
frame, i.e., on the twistor, such that the momentum is invariant. this is simply a
phase transformation:

g

  p = eip

we can generalize the penrose transform in a simple way to wave functions car-

rying indices to describe spin:

)(p, p .)]

for the integral to give a nonvanishing result, the integrand must be invariant under
the u(1) transformation generated by the helicity operator h: in other words,  must
have a transformation under h, i.e., a certain helicity, that is exactly the opposite that

b. poincare

145

of the explicit p factors that carry the external indices to give a contribution to the
integral, since otherwise integrating over the phase of p would average it to zero.
(explicitly, if we derive the helicity by acting on the penrose transform, this minus
sign comes from integration by parts.) this means that (x) automatically has a
certain helicity, half the number of dotted minus undotted indices:

h = 1

2(n  m)

[w = 1

2(m + n)]

(also for e > 0), as given by the above twistor operator expression acting on .
(alternatively, comparing the x-space form of the pauli-lubansky vector, its action
plus that of the twistor-space one must vanish on |ip, so the helicity is again minus
the twistor-space helicity operator acting on the prefactor.)

since, after restricting to the appropriate helicity, the integral over this phase is
trivial, we can also eliminate it by replacing the volume integral over the twistor
or its complex conjugate (but not both) with a surface (boundary) integral:

z d2p i pdp

(alternatively, we can insert a -function in the helicity.) the result is equivalent to
the usual integral over the three independent components of the momentum.

this generalization of the penrose transform implies that (x) satises some

equations of motion besides p2 = 0, namely

.

p .... ....
bb + wa = 0 (see exercise iib2.3). besides poincare

that generalizes duality and chiral transformations. we also see that (anti-)self-
duality and chirality are related to helicity. another way to understand the twistor
result is to remember its interpretation as a lorentz transformation from the light

supersymmetry is a symmetry that relates fermions to bosons. it includes the
poincare group as a subgroup. well see later that quantum eld theory requires par-
ticles with integer spin to be bosons, and those with half-integer spin to be fermions.
this means that any symmetry that relates bosonic wave functions/elds to fermionic
ones must be generated by operators with half-integer spin. the simplest (but also
the most general, at least of those that preserve the vacuum) is spin 1/2. in this
section we look at representations, generalizing the results of the previous sections
for poincare symmetry.

although supersymmetry has not been experimentally veried yet, it is a major

ingredient in the most promising generalizations of the standard model:

(1) the fact that it enlarges the symmetry of nature means that it further restricts

the allowed models, and thus makes stronger predictions.

(2) the greater symmetry also simplies quantum calculations in many ways, es-
pecially through the use of the concept of superspace. the results of these
calculations are also often simplied.

(3) because supersymmetric calculations are simpler, they can be used to simplify

nonsupersymmetric calculations, at both the classical and quantum levels.

(4) this simplication in quantum rules results in improved high-energy behavior. in
some cases it even results in the absence of the innities in momentum integration
that occur in all nonsupersymmetric theories. although these innities can be
removed in perturbation theory, their eects reappear upon summation of the
expansion.

(5) this improvement at high energies also improves the experimental agreement of

grand unied theories of the strong, electromagnetic, and weak interactions.

1. algebra

from quantum mechanics we know that for any operator a

h|{a, a}|i =xn
=xn

(h|a|nihn|a|i + h|a|nihn|a|i)

(|hn|a|i|2 + |hn|a|i|2)  0

from inserting a complete set of states. in particular,

{a, a} = 0  a = 0

148

ii. spin

from examining the matrix element for all states |i. this means the anticommuta-
tion relations of the supersymmetry generators must be nontrivial.

we are then led to anticommutation relations of the form, in dirac (majorana)

notation,

{q, q} = p/

or

{q, q} = paa20

(we use translations instead of internal symmetry or lorentz generators because of
dimensional analysis: bosonic elds dier in dimension from fermionic ones by half
integers.) note that this implies the positivity of the energy:

tr{q, q} = 2pa tr(a0) = 2pa tr( 1

2{a, 0}) = p0 12

tr i

similar arguments imply that the supersymmetry generators are constrained, just
as the momentum is constrained by the mass-shell condition. for example, in the
massless case,

{p/q, qp/} = p/p/p/ =  1

2 p2p/ = 0  p/q = 0

in four dimensions the commutation relations can be written in terms of irre-

ducible spinors as

.
.
,
{q, q
} = p

{q, q} = {q, q} = 0

this generalizes straightforwardly to more than one spinor, carrying a u(n) index:

} = j

2. supercoordinates

since the momentum is usually represented as coordinate derivatives, we natu-
rally look for a similar representation for supersymmetry. we therefore introduce
an anticommuting spinor coordinate . because of the anticommutation relations q
cant be simply /, but the modication is obvious:

q = i

.

q . = i

we can also express supersymmetry in terms of its action on the supercoordinates:

note that (q) = q

., (q) = q ..

we can also dene covariant derivatives: derivatives that (anti)commute with

(are invariant under) supersymmetry. these are easily found to be

d =

2

.

p

.
,

d . =

2 p .

besides overall normalization factors of i, leading to the opposite hermiticity condition
., these dier from the qs by the relative sign of the two terms. these
(d) =  d
changes combine to preserve

.
.
{d, d
,
} = p

{d, d} = { d, d} = 0

as a result of which p is also a covariant derivative as well as being a symmetry
generator (as for the poincare group), but now (d) = + d ..

in classical mechanics, the fact that /x commutes with translations is dual to
the fact that the innitesimal change dx, or the nite change x  x, is also invariant
= (/x)2 being poincare
under translations. furthermore, the dalembertian
invariant is dual to the line element ds2 = (dx)2 being invariant. this allows the
construction of the action from
in the supersymmetric case the innitesimal
invariants under the qs (and therefore p) are

although these can be used to construct classical mechanics actions, their quantiza-
tion is rather complicated. just as for particles of one particular spin, direct treatment
of the quantum mechanics has proven much simpler than deriving it by quantization
of a classical system.

exercise iic2.1

check explicitly the invariance of the above innitesimal and nite dierences
under supersymmetry.

now that we have a (super)coordinate representation of the supersymmetry gen-
erators, we can examine the wave functions/elds that carry this representation. such
superelds can be taylor expanded in the s with a nite number of terms, with
ordinary elds as the coecients. for example, if we expand a real (hermitian) scalar
supereld

(x, , ) = (x) + (x) +

which mix the dierent spins.

an alternative, and more convenient, way to dene the  expansion is by use of

the covariant derivatives. using | to mean |=0, we can dene
...

 = (d)|,

 . = ( d .)|,

there is some ambiguity at higher orders in  because the ds dont anticommute, and
this can be resolved according to whatever is convenient for the particular problem,
avoiding eld redenitions in terms of elds appearing at lower order in : since
the eld equations must be covariant under supersymmetry (otherwise there is no
advantage to using superelds), they must be written with the covariant derivatives.
then one denes the component expansions by choosing the same ordering of ds as
appear in the eld equations (where relevant), which gives the component expansion
of the eld equations the simplest form. it also gives a convenient method for deriving
supersymmetry transformations, since the ds anticommute with the qs:

[(d...d)|] = [d...d()]| = [d...d(iq)]| = [(iq)d...d]| = [(d)d...d]|

where we have used the fact that q = id + -stu, where the -stu is killed by
evaluating at  = 0, once it has been pulled in front of all the -derivatives. covariant

derivatives can also be used for integration, since r d = / = d up to an x-
derivative, which can be dropped when also integratingr dx.

3. supergroups

we saw certain relations between the lower-dimensional classical groups that
turned out to be useful for just the cases of physical interest of rotational (so(d1)),
lorentz (so(d1,1)), and conformal (so(d,2)) groups. in particular, the poincare
group, though not a classical group, is a certain limit (contraction) of the groups
so(d,1) and so(d1,2), and a subgroup of the conformal group. similar remarks
apply to supersymmetry, but because of its relation to spinors, these classical su-
pergroups (or graded classical groups) exist only for certain lower dimensions, the

c. supersymmetry

151

same as those where covering groups for the orthogonal groups exist. in higher di-
mensions the supergroups do not correspond to supersymmetry, at least not in any
way that can be represented on physical states.

well consider only the graded generalization of the classical groups that appear
in the bosonic case. the basic idea is then to take the group metrics and combine
them in ways that take into account the dierence in symmetry between bosons and
fermions:

unitary:

orthosymplectic:

real:

pseudoreal (*):

.
ab


m ab
 .
b
a
 .
a

b

where  is symmetric and  antisymmetric, as before, while m is graded symmetric:
for a = (a, ) with bosonic indices a and fermionic ones ,

m [ab) = 0 : m ab  m ba = m a  m a = m  + m  = 0

again we have inverse metrics, e.g.,

m kimkj = i
j

with respect to the usual index-contraction convention (no extra grading signs when
superscript is contracted with subscript immediately following), we should take the
ordering of indices on  as j

i.

there is no analog of the  tensor, at least for nite-dimensional groups, since it
would have an innite number of indices when totally symmetric. however, special
supergroups can still be dened by generalizing the denition of trace and determinant
to supermatrices. one convenient way to do this is by using gaussian integrals, since
this is a common way that such expressions will arise. as a generalization of the
bosonic and fermionic identities we therefore dene the superdeterminant

(sdet m)1 = nz dz dz ezm z

where n is a normalization factor dened so sdet i = 1. by explicitly evaluating
the integral, separating out the commuting and anticommuting parts, we nd (see
exercise ib3.3)

sdet(cid:18) a b

c d(cid:19) =

det a

det(d  ca1b)

=

det(a  bd1c)

det d

152

ii. spin

where here a and d contain only bosonic elements, while b and c are completely
fermionic.

exercise iic3.1

generalize exercise ib3.3 to superdeterminants: divide up the range of a
square matrix into two (not necessarily equal) parts, where each of the two
parts may include indices of both fermionic and bosonic grading, so the four
resulting blocks in the matrix may each include both commuting and anti-
commuting elements. show that

sdet(cid:18) a b

c d(cid:19) = sdet d  sdet(a  bd1c) = sdet a  sdet(d  ca1b)

by integration.

the supertrace (see also exercise ia2.3c) then can be dened by generalizing

the bosonic identity det(em ) = etr m :

sdet(em ) = estr m

str(ma

b) = (1)ama

a = ma

a  m

 = tr a  tr d

follows, as in the bosonic case, from  ln sdet m = str(m1m), which is derived by
varying the gaussian denition.

exercise iic3.2

show that for graded matrices we need to use str (and not tr) for the identity

str(mn) = str(nm)

a useful identity for superdeterminants can be derived by starting with the fol-
lowing identity for the inverse of a matrix for which the range of the indices has been
divided into two pieces:

(cid:18) a

c

b

d(cid:19)1

=(cid:18) (a  bd1c)1

(b  ac1d)1

(c  db1a)1

(d  ca1b)1(cid:19)

we have assumed all the submatrices are square and invertible; equivalent expressions,
which are more useful in other cases, can be derived easily by multiplying and dividing
by the submatrices: for example,

c

from either of these we immediately see

(a  bd1c)1

=(cid:18)
d(cid:19)1
(cid:18) a b
c d(cid:19)  sdet(cid:18) a b
=(cid:18) a b

the graded generalizations of the classical groups are then

gl(m|n,c) [sl(m|n,c),ssl(n|n,c)]
u: [s]u(m+,m|n) [ssu(n+,n|n++n)]
osp: osp(m|2n,c)
r: gl(m|n) [sl(m|n),ssl(n|n)]
*: [s]u*(2m|2n) [ssu*(2n|2n)]
u & osp
r: osp(m+,m|2n)
*: osp*(2m|2n)

where (m|n) refers to m bosonic and n fermionic indices, or vice versa.
in the
matrices of the dening representation, the elements with one bosonic index and one
fermionic are anticommuting numbers, while those with both indices of the same kind
are commuting. in particular, the commuting parts give the bosonic subgroups:

gl(m|n,c)  gl(m,c)gl(n,c)
sl(m|n,c)  gl(m,c)sl(n,c)
ssl(n|n,c)  sl(n,c)sl(n,c)
u(m+,m|n)  u(m+,m)u(n)
su(m+,m|n)  u(m+,m)su(n)

sl(m|n)  gl(m)sl(n)
ssl(n|n)  sl(n)sl(n)
u*(2m|2n)  u*(2m)u*(2n)
su*(2m|2n)  u*(2m)su*(2n)
ssu*(2n|2n)  su*(2n)su*(2n)

osp(m+,m|2n)  so(m+,m)sp(2n)
osp*(2m|2n)  so*(2m)usp(2n)

when the commuting and anticommuting dimensions are equal, we can impose trace-
lessness conditions on both bosonic parts of the generators separately (ss: tr a =
tr d = 0). this is related to the fact str(i) = 0 in such cases.

154

ii. spin

4. superconformal

since the conformal group is a classical group, its supersymmetric generalization
should be a classical supergroup. because the fermionic generators must include the
supersymmetry generators, which are spinors, the representation of the conformal
group that appears in the dening representation of the supergroup must be the spinor
representation. however, we have seen that only for n6 (where covering groups exist)
and n=8 (where the spinor of so(8) is another of its dening representations) can
the spinor representation of so(n) be dened by classical group restrictions. this
implies that the superconformal group exists only in d4 and d=6.

the relevant supergroups can be identied easily by looking at the bosonic sub-

groups:

d = 3 : osp(n|4)

4 : su(2,2|n) (or ssu(2,2|4))
6 : osp*(8|2n)

(we consider only d>2, since the conformal group is innite-dimensional in d2.)
these three cases of d=3,4,6 are special for a number of reasons:
in particular,
these three supergroups can be related to su(n|4) over the division algebras: the
real numbers, complex numbers, and quaternions, respectively.
(similar remarks
apply to their important classical bosonic subgroups: the conformal, lorentz, and
rotation groups. attempts have been made to extend these results to the octonions
for d=10, but with less success, and there seems to be no superconformal group for
that case.) however, just as in the case of the hilbert space of quantum mechanics,
the complex numbers seems to be the best of these division algebras, having the
analytic properties the real numbers lack, while avoiding the noncommutativity of
the quaternions. well see later that nontrivial interacting (local, classical) conformal
eld theories exist only in d4.

for example, for d=4 we nd that the bosonic generators are the conformal group
and the internal symmetry group u(n) (or su(4) for n=4), while the fermionic gener-
ators include supersymmetry (n spinors) and its fraternal twin, s-supersymmetry.
as supersymmetry is the square root of translations, so s-supersymmetry is the
square-root of conformal boosts.

exercise iic4.1

for d=4, write the (graded) commutation relations of the superconformal
generators. decompose them into representations of the lorentz group, and
nd their commutation relations.

c. supersymmetry

155

5. supertwistors

we saw that a simple way to nd representations of so(4,2) was to use the
coordinate representation for su(2,2): the resulting twistors gave all massless rep-
resentations (p2 = 0 for all helicities). this method generalizes straightforwardly to
the superconformal groups: the generators are

ga

b =  b a

(for the su case we should also subtract out the trace, but that generator commutes
with the rest anyway.) the coordinates and their conjugate momenta satisfy

[a,  b} = b

a

 a is then in the dening representation of the supergroup, while the wave function,
which is a function of , contains more general representations.

for d=3, the reality condition sets  = , so the s are the graded generalization
of dirac  matrices. in fact, the anticommuting s are the  matrices of the so(n)
subgroup of the osp(n|4). on the other hand, the commuting s carry the index of
the dening representation of sp(4), so they are a spinor of so(3,2), the 3d conformal
group: they are the bosonic twistor, and can be used in a similar way to the 4d
twistors discussed earlier.

for d=4, there is a u(1) symmetry acting on  under which ga

b is invariant,

generated by (1)aga

a, as in the bosonic case: this is the superhelicity.

for d=6,  is pseudoreal. in general, for pseudoreal representations of groups it is
often convenient to introduce a new su(2) under which the pseudoreal representation
 a and its equivalent complex conjugate representation 
a transform as a doublet
(su(2) spinor). this is also obvious from construction, since half of the components
are related to the complex conjugate of the other half. we then can write

.
b .

 ai = ( a, i

.
k .

ai;

ac ki, m ai,bk = m abc ik

ga

b =  biai

(thus, osp*(2m|2n)osp(4n|4m), and so*(2m)sp(4m), usp(2n)so(4n).) this
means there is now an su(2) symmetry on , generated by

gij =  a

(iaj)

b is invariant. this is the 6d version of superhelicity. in the d=6
under which ga
light cone, the manifest part of lorentz invariance is so(d2)=so(4)=su(2)su(2).
this is one of those su(2)s.

156

ii. spin

we now concentrate on d=4 (although our methods generalize straightforwardly
to d=3 and 6). the simplest way to nd (massless) representations of 4d super-
symmetry is to generalize the penrose transform. just as twistors automatically
satisfy the massless eld equations in d=4, supertwistors automatically satisfy their
supersymmetric generalization. the supertwistor is the dening representation of
su(2,2|n). the su(2,2) part is the usual twistor, while the su(n) part is the usual
fermionic creation and annihilation operators for su(n). thus, to relate superspace
to supertwistors, we write

p

.
 = i

.
  p p.



.


i 

qi. = i i. + 1

2 i .  ai p .

this determines the penrose transform from superspace to supertwistors:

where we have used chiral superelds (trivial dependence on , via the constraint
di. = 0) without loss of generality.
(instead of treating ai as coordinates to be
integrated, we can also treat them as operators; we then make the s functions of a,
and replace the integration with vacuum evaluation h0| |0i.) as for ordinary twistors,
this result can be related to the lightcone: for given momentum, we can choose the

exercise iic5.1

find the penrose transform for d=3. (warning: the anticommuting part
of the twistor is now like dirac matrices rather than creation/annihilation
operators.)

taylor expanding in ai (and thus i, producing terms antisymmetric in i...j and

antisymmetric, and terminating with another singlet, where

from our discussion of helicity in subsection iib7, we see that the states also decrease
in helicity by 1/2 for each a (i.e., ignoring , each i comes with a p, simply because
it adds an undotted index). taking the direct product with any helicity (coming from
the explicit ps and p .s carrying the external lorentz indices), we see that the states

have helicity h, h  1/2, h  1, ..., h  n/2, with multiplicty(cid:0)n

this multiplet structure is carried separately by + and by , which are related
by charge (complex) conjugation, one describing the antiparticles of the other, as for
ordinary twistors. (the existence of both multiplets also follows from cpt invariance,
which is required for local actions, to be discussed in subsection ivb1. here we
generalized from the penrose transform, which contained both terms as a consequence
of being the most general solution to sabpb + wpa = 0, which is cpt invariant.)
because of the values of the helicities, we can impose a reality condition, identifying
all states with helicity j as the complex conjugates of those with j, only for h =
hn/2  h = n/4, when n is a multiple of 4. we can also get larger representations
by taking the direct product of these smallest representations of supersymmetry with
representations of u(n), in which case the elds will carry those additional su(n)
indices.

exercise iic5.2

lets examine these 4d multiplets in detail:

a list the su(n) representations for each allowed value of n for each of the
cases where the helicity |h|  1/2 (scalar multiplets), 1 (vector multi-
plets), 3/2 (gravitino multiplets), or 2 (graviton multiplets), assuming
the maximum-helicity state is a singlet.

b show that supergravity (graviton multiplets) can exist only for n8. show
that the relevant representation for n=8, if real, is the same as the one (com-
plex) for n=7.

c find the analogous statements for super yang-mills (vector multiplets).

the explicit form of the reality condition is somewhat complicated in terms of
the chiral superelds, because they are really eld strengths of real gauge elds.

iii. local

in the previous chapters we considered symmetries acting on coordinates or wave
functions. for the most part, the transformations we considered had constant param-
eters: they were global transformations. in this chapter we will consider mostly
eld theory. since elds are functions of spacetime, it will be natural to consider
transformations whose parameters are also functions of spacetime, especially those
that are localized in some small region. such local or gauge transformations are
fundamental in dening the theories that describe the fundamental interactions.

a fundamental concept in physics, of as great importance as symmetry, is the
action principle. in quantum physics the dynamics is necessarily formulated in terms
of an action (in the path-integral approach), or an equivalent hamiltonian (in the
heisenberg and schrodinger approaches). action principles are also convenient and
powerful for classical physics, allowing all eld equations to be derived from a single
function, and making symmetries simpler to check.

1. general

we begin with some general properties of actions. (for this subsection well re-
strict ourselves to bosonic variables; however, in the following subsection well nd
that the only modication for fermions is a more careful treatment of signs.) gen-
erally, equations of motion are derived from actions by setting their variation with
respect to their arguments to vanish:

s[]  s[ + ]  s[] = 0

the solutions to this equation (nd , given s) are extrema of the action; generally
we want them to be minima, corresponding to minima of the energy, so that they will
be stable under small perturbations.

exercise iiia1.1

often continuous coordinates are replaced with discrete ones, for calculational
or conceptual purposes. consider

s = 

xn=

1

2(qn+1  qn)2

the integer n is interpreted as a discrete time, in terms of some small unit.

160

iii. local

a show that

s = 0  qn+1  2qn + qn1 = 0

b examine the continuum limit of the action and equations of motion: introduce

appropriate factors of , with t = n, and take the limit   0.

now we take the variables  to be functions of time; thus, s is a function of
functions, a functional.
it just means that s is a function of an innite set of
variables. we can generalize properties of ordinary functions (derivatives, etc.) as
usual by considering discrete time and taking a continuum limit:

i = 1, 2, ...  t  [,]



(t)

i  (t)

 z dt
xi
ij  (t  t)

i 
z di  z d(t)

z dt f (t)(t  t)  f (t)

(the last, a functional integral, will appear in quantum theory) where ij is the
usual kronecker delta function, while (t  t) is the dirac delta function. its not
really a function, since it takes only the values 0 or , but a distribution, meaning
its dened only by integration:

of course, the variable (t) can also carry an index (or indices). in eld theory, it
will also be a function of more coordinates, those of space.

for example, making these substitutions into the denition of a (partial) deriva-

tive to get a functional derivative,

f (i)

j

= lim
0

f (i + ij)  f (i)





f [(t)]
(t)

= lim
0

f [(t) + (t  t)]  f [(t)]



sometimes the functional derivative is dened in terms of that of the variable itself:

(t)
(t)

= (t  t)

if we apply this denition of the dirac  to /, we obtain the previous denition of

the functional derivative. (consider, e.g., varying s =r dt f (t)(t) for a xed func-

tion f .) however, in practice we never need to use these denitions of the functional

a. actions

161

derivative: the only thing for which we need a functional derivative is the action,
whose functional derivative is dened by its variation,

s[]  s[ + ]  s[] z dt (t)

s

(t)

(the fact that the variation can always be written in this form is just the statement
that it is linear in , since  is innitesimal.)

a general principle of mechanics is locality, that events at one time directly
aect only those events an innitesimal time away. (in eld theory these events can
be also only an innitesimal distance away in space.) this means that the action can
be expressed in terms of a lagrangian:

s[] =z dt l[(t)]

where l at time t is a function of only (t) and a nite number of its derivatives. for
more subtle reasons, this number of time derivatives is restricted to be no more than
two for any term in l; after integration by parts, each derivative acts on a dierent
factor of . the general form of the action is then

(specically, u = (m)(u/m), etc. note that our denition of the lagrangian
diers in sign from the usual.) the equations of motion following from varying an
action that can be written in terms of a lagrangian are

to ).

162

iii. local

locality applies only to the classical action; in quantum eld theory we will also
nd eective actions that include nonlocal contributions from quantum eects.
similar eects can appear in classical theories; for example, electrodynamics in the
coulomb gauge includes a (spatially) nonlocal coulomb interaction term. the in-
terpretation is always that some quantity has been eliminated, which would return
locality (e.g., the longitudinal photon in the coulomb gauge). such actions can
still be varied by the same methods as above. however, one should always avoid the
rule l/ = t(l/t), since (1) it applies only to actions that can be expressed
.
in terms of just  and
 (and not higher derivatives nor nonlocalities), and (2) it
arbitrarily separates terms into two sets.

such actions can be reduced to ones that are only linear in time derivatives
by introducing additional variables. first, separate out the subspace where g is
invertible, with coordinates q (m = (qi, r)); the lagrangian is then written as

l(q, r) =  1

2

.
qi .
qjgij(q, r) +

.
qiai(q, r) +

.
ra(q, r) + u(q, r)

this lagrangian gives equivalent equations of motion to

l(q, p, r) = [ .

qipi +

.
ra] + [ 1

2gij(pi + ai)(pj + aj) + u]

where gij is the inverse of gij. (many other forms are possible by redenitions of p.)
eliminating the new variables p by their equations of motion gives back l(q, r). note
that this works only because ps equations of motion are algebraic: for example,
.
x = p is
2p2), since it would require solving
for the time dependence of x. on the other hand, p is given explicitly in terms of
the other variables by its equations of motion without inverting time derivatives, so
eliminating it does not lose any of the dynamics. (it is an auxiliary variable.)

eliminating x from the lagrangian  .
illegal (it would give the trivial action s = r dt 1

the result is a hamiltonian form of the lagrangian:

lh () = i

in terms of the hamiltonian h, where  = (q, p, r). it has the gauge invariance

am = m ()

.
(where m = /m ), since that adds only a total derivative term i
. clearly a
will introduce a modication of the poisson bracket if it is not linear in  (e.g., as
when we make independent nonlinear redenitions of coordinates and momenta on

a. actions

163

the usual form of the lagrangian). to determine this modication we compare the
equation of motion as dened by a poisson bracket,

.
m = i[m , h] = i[m , n ]n h

with that following from varying the action,

.
nfn m + m h = 0,

i

fm n = [man ]

to nd

[m , n ] = (f1)n m

where f1 is the inverse on the maximal subspace where f is invertible. the
variables in the directions where f vanishes are auxiliary, since they appear without
time derivatives: their equations of motion are not described by the poisson bracket.
in particular, if they appear linearly in h they are lagrange multipliers, whose
variation imposes algebraic constraints on the rest of .

finally, we can make redenitions of the part of  describing the invertible sub-

space so that a is linear:

am = 1

2 n n m  lh() = 1
2 i

.
m n n m + h()

where  is a constant, hermitian, antisymmetric (and thus imaginary) matrix. for
some purposes it is more convenient to assume this hamiltonian form of the action
as a starting point. we now have the canonical commutation relations as

where m n is the inverse of n m on the maximal subspace:

[m , n ] = m n

m n p n = p

m

for the projection operator  for that subspace.

equivalent quantum mechanically, where boundary terms (dropped when using inte-
gration by parts for deriving the equations of motion) contribute. furthermore, the
hamiltonian form of the action

s =z dt h  dxipi

shows that the energy h relates to the time in the same way the momentum relates to
the coordinates, except for an interesting minus sign that is explained only by special
relativity.

2. fermions

in nonrelativistic quantum mechanics, spin is usually treated as a quantum eect,
rather than being derived from classical mechanics. although it is possible to derive
spin from classical mechanics, in general it is rather cumbersome, and involves rst
introducing a large number of spins and then constraining away all the undesired ones,
whereas in the quantum mechanics one can just directly introduce some particular
representation of the spin angular momentum operators. the one nontrivial exception
is spin 1/2.

we know from quantum mechanics that the spin variables for spin 1/2 are de-
scribed by the pauli  matrices. since they satisfy anticommutation relations, and
are represented by nite-dimensional matrices, they are interpreted as fermionic. we
have already seen that classical fermions are described by anticommuting numbers,
so we begin by considering general quantization of such objects.

we can now consider actions that depend on both commuting and anticommuting
classical variables, m = (m, ), where now  refers to the bosonic variables and 
to the fermionic ones. the hamiltonian form of the lagrangian can again be written
as

lh () = 1
2i

.
m n n m + h()

when  is invertible, the graded bracket is dened by (see subsection ia2)

to describe spin 1/2, we therefore look for particle actions of the form

[m , n} = hm n ,
sh =z dt[ .

xipi + 1
2i

m n p n = m
p

.
ii + h(x, p, )]

a. actions

165

this corresponds to using

m = (m; ) = (i; i) = (xi, pi; i)

mn = i,j = ijc,

 = ij = ij,

m = n = 0

the fundamental commutation relations are then

[xi, pj] = ihi
j,

{i, j} = hij

([x, x] = [p, p] = [x, ] = [p, ] = 0)

we recognize i as the pauli  matrices (the dirac matrices of subsection ic1 for
the special case of so(3), normalized as in subsection iia1), i = hi. the free
hamiltonian is just

h =

p2
2m

as for spin 0: spin does not aect the motion of free particles.

a more interesting case is coupling to electromagnetism: quantum mechanically,

the hamiltonian can be written in the simple form

h = {i[pi + qai(x)]}2

mh

 qa0(x)

in terms of the vector and scalar potentials ai and a0. the classical expression is not
as simple, because the commutation relations must be used to cancel the 1/h before

taking the classical limit. this is an example of minimal coupling,

h(pi)  h(pi + qai)  qa0

however, this prescription works only if h for spin 1/2 is written in the above form:

using the commutation relations before or after minimal coupling gives dierent re-

sults. the form we have used is justied only by considering the nonrelativistic limit

of the relativistic theory.

exercise iiia2.1

use the multipication rules of the  matrices to show that the quantum me-

chanical hamiltonian for spin 1/2 in an electromagnetic eld can be written

as a spin-independent piece, identical to the spin-0 hamiltonian, plus a term

coupling the spin to the magnetic eld.

166

iii. local

3. fields

actions for eld theories are just a special case (not a generalization) of the
actions we have just considered: we just treat spatial coordinates ~x as part of the
indices carried by the variables appearing in the action. in the notation used above,

m  (i, ~x)

m (t)  i(t, ~x)

then spatial derivatives are just certain matrices with respect to the m index,r d~x

comes from summation over m, etc.

the eld equations for all eld theories (e.g., electromagnetism) are wave equa-
tions. wave equations also follow from mechanics upon quantization. although
classical eld theory and quantum mechanics are not equivalent in their physical in-
terpretation, they are mathematically equivalent in that they have identical wave
equations. this is true not only for the free theories, but also for particles in external
elds, and without direct self-interactions. this is no accident: classical eld theory
and classical mechanics are two dierent limits of quantum eld theory. they are
both called classical limits, and written as h  0, but since h is really 1, this limit
depends on how one inserts hs into the quantum eld theory action.

the wave equation in quantum mechanics is the schrodinger equation. the cor-
responding eld theory action is then simply the one that gives this wave equation
as the equation of motion, where the wave function is replaced with the eld:

sf t =z d4x *(it + h)

as usual (cf. electromagnetism), the eld is a function of space and time; thus, we
integrate d4x = dt d3x over the three space and one time dimensions. the hamilto-
nian is some function of coordinates and momenta, with the replacement pi  ii,
where i = /xi are the space derivatives and t = /t is the time derivative.

the hamiltonian can contain coupling to other elds. for a general hamilto-
nian quadratic in momenta, in a notation implied by the corresponding lagrangian
quadratic in time derivatives,

h = 1

2 gij(ii + ai)(ij + aj) + u

where gij, ai, and u are now interpreted as elds, and thus depend on both xi and t,
as does . in the case gij = ij, we can identify ai and u as the three-vector and scalar
potentials of electromagnetism, and we can add the usual action for electromagnetism

a. actions

167

to the action for . the action then can be varied also with respect to a and u to
obtain maxwells equations with a current in terms of  and *. we can also treat
gij as a eld, in which case it and parts of a and u are the components of the
gravitational eld.

.
 term as a special case of the

field theory actions can be quantized in the same ways as mechanics ones. in
.
this case, we recognize the *
 term in the
generic hamiltonian form of the action discussed earlier. thus, (xi) and *(xi)
have replaced xi and pi as the variables; xi is now just an index (label) on  and *,
just as i was an index on xi and pi. the eld-theory hamiltonian is then identied
as

hf t[, *] =z d3x h,

h = *h

in eld theory the hamiltonian will always be a space integral of a hamiltonian
density h.

the classical limit of a quantum theory dened by a classical action s can be

dened as follows: introduce h into the theory by replacing

s  h1s

this has no eect on the classical equations of motion, but it introduces h into the
poisson bracket:

 .
qp + h

[q, p] = i,

d
dt



.
qp +

1
h


t

h

1
h
1
h

=

+ i

[h, ]

we can then recognize the limit h  0 as the classical limit. in the quantum theory,
it is equivalent to replacing

p  ihq,

it  h  iht  h

i.e., all derivatives get a factor of h. (more details will be possible when we consider
quantization in subsection va2.) however, a quantum theory can often be described
by more than one classical action: this is known as duality (between any two such
actions).

in particular, any free quantum eld theory, and many interacting ones, can be
described by both a classical mechanics action and by a classical eld theory action:
this is the well-known wave-particle duality. we have just seen the standard
nonrelativistic example. furthermore, since we know the direct relation between the
two actions in terms of the mechanics hamiltonian h, we can describe both classical

168

iii. local

limits directly in terms of just the eld theory action. the classical eld theory limit
is dened by inserting h as

on the other hand, if we put in hs as

sf t  h1

f t sf t

i  hmi,

t  hmt

which gives the usual h dependence associated with the schrodinger equation, then
the classical limit hm  0 gives classical mechanics. this denes classical mechanics
as the macroscopic limit, the limit of large distances and times.

a convenient way to implement this limit is to introduce the mechanics action
xipi + h) into the eld theory, and then take the limit hm  0 after the

s =r dt( .

replacement

s  h1
m s

on the mechanics action instead of on the derivatives. the mechanics action can be
introduced when solving the eld equations: the solution to the wave equation can
be expressed in terms of the propagator, which in turn can be written in terms of the
mechanics action or hamiltonian.

more generally, we can dene actions that are not restricted to be quadratic in

any eld. the hamiltonian density h(t, xi) or lagrangian density l(t, xi),

s[] =z dt d3x l[(t, xi)]

should be a function of elds at that point, with only a nite number (usually no
more than two) spacetime derivatives. this is the denition of locality used for gen-
eral quantum systems in subsection iiia1, but extended from derivatives in time to
also those in space. although this condition is not always used in nonrelativistic
eld theory (for example, when long-range interactions, such as coulomb or gravita-
tional, are described without attributing them to elds), it is crucial in relativistic
eld theory. for example, global symmetries lead by locality to local (current) conser-
vation laws. locality is also the reason that spacetime coordinates are so important:
translation invariance says that the position of the origin is an unphysical, redundant
variable; however, locality is most easily used with this redundancy.

field equations are derived by the straightforward generalization of the variation
of actions dened in subsection iiia1: as follows from treating the spatial coordinates
in the same way as discrete indices,

4. relativity

generalization to relativistic theories is straightforward, except for the fact that
the klein-gordon equation is second-order in time derivatives; however, we are fa-
miliar with such actions from nonrelativistic quantum mechanics. as usual, we need
to check the sign of the terms in the action: checking the positivity of the hamil-
tonian (i.e., the energy), we see from the general relation between the lagrangian
and hamiltonian (subsection iiia1) that the terms without time derivatives must be
positive; the time-derivative terms are then determined by lorentz covariance.

at this point we introduce some normalizations and conventions that will prove
convenient for fourier transformation and other reasons to be explained later. when-
ever d-dimensional integrations are involved (as should be clear from context), we
use

ddp

z dx z

ddx
(2)d/2 ,
(x  x)  (2)d/2d(x  x),

z dp z
(p  p)  (2)d/2d(p  p)

(2)d/2

in particular, this normalization will be used in green functions and actions. for
example, these implicit 2s appear in functional variations:

s z dx 

s
 



(x)

(x) = (x  x)

the action for a real scalar is then

s =z dx l,

l = 1

4()2 + v ()

170

iii. local

where v ()  0, and we now write l for the lagrange density. in particular, v =
4m22 for the free theory. the free eld equation is then p2 + m2 =  + m2 = 0,
replacing the nonrelativistic it+h = 0. for a complex scalar, we replace 1
2  
in both terms.

we know from previous considerations (subsection iib2) that the eld equation
for a free, massless, dirac spinor is    = 0. the generalization to the massive case
(subsection iib4) is obvious from various considerations, e.g., dimensional analysis;
the action is

good ultraviolet behavior: all quantum eld theories should have only couplings with
nonnegative mass (engineering) dimension.

the energy-momentum tensor for electromagnetism is much simpler in this spinor
notation, and follows (up to normalization) from gauge invariance, dimensional anal-
ysis, lorentz invariance, and the vanishing of its trace. it has a form similar to that
of the current in electrodynamics:

note that it is invariant under the duality transformations of subsection iia7 (as is
the electrodynamic current under chirality).

we have used conventions where e appears multiplying only the action sa, and

not in the covariant derivative

 =  + iqa

where q is the charge in units of e: e.g., q = 1 for the proton, q = 1 for the electron.
alternatively, we can scale a, as a eld redenition, to produce the opposite situation:

the former form, which we use unless noted otherwise, has the advantage that the
coupling appears only in the one term sa, while the latter has the advantage that the
kinetic (free) term for a is normalized the same way as for scalars. the former form
has the further advantage that e appears in the gauge transformations of none of the
elds, making it clear that the group theory does not depend on the value of e. (this
will be more important when generalizing to nonabelian groups in section iiic.)

note that the massless part of the kinetic (free) terms in these actions are scale
invariant (in arbitrary dimensions, when the dimension-independent forms are used),
when the elds are assigned the scale weights found from conformal arguments in
subsection iib2.

exercise iiia4.5

using vector notation, minimal coupling, and dimensional analysis, nd the
mass dimensions of the electric charge e in arbitrary spacetime dimensions,
and show it is dimensionless only in d = 4.

an interesting distinction between gravity and electromagnetism is that static
bodies always attract gravitationally, whereas electrically they repel if they are like
and attract if they are opposite. this is a direct consequence of the fact that the
graviton has spin 2 while the photon has spin 1: the lagrangian for a eld of integer
spin s coupled to a current, in an appropriate gauge and the weak-eld approximation,
is

4s! a1...as a1...as + 1

s! a1...asj a1...as

174

iii. local

where the sign of the rst term is xed by unitarity in quantum eld theory. (clas-
sically the sign can also be related to positivity of the energy.) from a scalar eld in
the semiclassical approximation (see exercise iiia4.1 above), starting with

j a1...as  *


 a1

where a


 b means ab  (a)b, we see that the current will be of the form

j a1...as  pa1    pas

for a scalar particle, for some . (the same follows from comparing the expressions
for currents and energy-momentum tensors for particles as in subsection iiib4 below.
the only way to get vector indices out of a scalar particle, to couple to the vector
indices for the spin of the force eld, is from momentum.) in the static approximation,
only time components contribute: we then can write this lagrangian as, taking into
account 00 = 1,

(1)s 1

4s! 0...0 0...0 + 1

s! 0...0(p0)s

where e = p0 > 0 for a particle and < 0 for an antiparticle. thus the spin-dependence
of the potential/force between two particles goes as (e1e2)s. it then follows that
all particles attract by forces mediated by even-spin particles, and a particle and
its antiparticle attract under all forces, while repulsion will occur for odd-spin forces
between two identical particles. (we can substitute particles of the same sign charge
for identical particles, and particles of opposite sign charge for particle and its
antiparticle, where the charge is the coupling constant appropriate for that force.)

show that the above current is conserved,

5. constrained systems

constraints not only frequently appear in nonrelativistic physics, but are a general
feature of relativistic particles, so we now give a brief description of how they are
incorporated into actions. consider a general action, with constraints, in hamiltonian
form:

qmpm + h), h = hgi(q, p) + igi(q, p)

s =z dt( .

a. actions

175

(for simplicity, we consider all physical variables to be bosonic for this subsection,
but the method generalizes straightforwardly paying careful attention to signs.) this
action is a functional of qm, pm, i, which are in turn functions of t, where m and i run
over any number of values. we can think of this as describing a nonrelativistic particle
with coordinates q and momenta p in terms of time t, but the form is general enough to
.
apply to relativistic theories. the
qp term tells us p is canonically conjugate to q; the
rest of the action gives the hamiltonian, usually quadratic in momenta. the variables
i are lagrange multipliers, whose variation in the action implies the constraints
gi = 0. we then can interpret hgi as the usual (gauge invariant) hamiltonian. we
also require that the transformations generated by the constraints close, and that the
hamiltonian be invariant:

[gi, gj] = ifij

kgk,

[gi, hgi] = 0

jgj.) this says that the constraints
(more generally, we can allow [gi, hgi] = ifi
dont imply any new constraints that we might have missed, and that the energy
represented by hgi is invariant under these transformations.

we then nd that the action is invariant under the canonical transformations

(q, p) = i[ igi, (q, p)]  qm =  i gi
0 = (cid:18) d
+ ih(cid:19) = i(i)gi  i

 i =

dt(cid:19) = (cid:18) 

pm

 i +  jkfkj

pm =  i gi

qm

.
 igi + [jgj,  igi]

(with (d/dt) dened as in subsection ia1), where /t acts on the explicit t
dependence (that in everything except q and p): for general expressions, the total
time derivative and total variation are given by commutators as

d
dt

a =


t

a + i[h, a],

a = 0a + i[ igi, a]

where 0 acts on everything except q and p. the action then varies under these
transformations as the integral of a total derivative, which vanishes under appropriate
boundary conditions:

sh =z dt

d
dt

[(qm)pm +  igi] = 0

the simplest example is the case with one constraint, which is linear in the vari-
ables: if the constraint is p, the gauge transformation is q = , so we gauge q = 0
and use the constraint p = 0. in general, this means that for every degree of freedom

176

iii. local

we can gauge away, the conjugate variable can be xed by the constraint. thus,
for each constraint we eliminate 3 variables: the variable xed by the constraint, its
conjugate, and the lagrange multiplier that enforced the constraint, which has no
conjugate. (in the lagrangian form of the action the conjugate may not appear ex-
plicitly, so only 2 variables are eliminated.) as another example, for a nonrelativistic
particle constrained to a sphere, g = (xi)21, we can change to spherical coordinates,
apply the constraint to eliminate the radial coordinate, and use the gauge invariance
to eliminate the radial component of the momentum, leaving an unconstrained the-
ory in terms of angles and their conjugates. in most cases in eld theory a similar
procedure can be applied: the result is called a unitary gauge.

exercise iiia5.1

lets look closer at this example:

a perform quantization of a nonrelativistic particle on a sphere (g = (xi)2  1
for i = 1, 2, 3), reducing to an action in terms of just the angles  and , and
their conjugates.

b repeat this procedure using instead the constraint g = xipi, and compare.

the standard example of a relativistic constrained system is in eld theory 
electromagnetism. its action can be written in rst-order (in derivatives) formalism
by introducing an auxiliary eld gab:

f 2  f 2  g2  f 2  (g  f )2 = 2gf  g2

where in the rst step we added a trivial term for g and in the second step made
a trivial redenition of g, so elimination of g by its algebraic equation of motion
returns the original lagrangian. the hamiltonian form comes from eliminating only
gij by its eld equation, since only f0i contains time derivatives:

2gf  g2  (fij)2  4g0if0i + 2(g0i)2
.
aig0i + [2(g0i)2 + (fij)2]  4a0ig0i
= 4

which we recognize as the three generic terms for the action in hamiltonian form,
with g0i as the canonical momenta for ai, and a0 as the lagrange multiplier. the
constraint is gauss law, and it generates the usual gauge transformations.

thus i are also gauge elds for the gauge (time-dependent) transformations  i(t).

they allow construction of the gauge-covariant time derivative

 = t + iigi,

d
dt

=  + ihgi   = i[ igi,]

a. actions

177

it is convenient to transform the gauge elds away using these gauge transformations,
dt i is gauge invariant
under the linearized transformations, so the most we could expect is to gauge i to
constants. more precisely, the group element

so h = hgi. however, with the usual boundary conditionsr 
dt i(t)gi(cid:19)(cid:21)



t (cid:20)exp(cid:18)iz 



is gauge invariant, where t  is time ordering, meaning we write the exponential of
the integral as the product of exponentials of innitesimal integrals, and order them
with respect to time, later time intervals going to the left of earlier ones. (we treat
gi quantum mechanically or use poisson brackets when combining the exponentials.)
this is the quantum mechanical version of the time development resulting from the
corresponding term in the classical action. it is also the phase factor coming from
the innite limit of the covariant time translation

ek(t) = t (cid:20)exp(cid:18)iz t

tk

dt i(t)gi(cid:19)(cid:21) ekt

as seen from reordering the time derivatives when writing ek(t) as the product of
exponentials of innitesimal exponents. this allows us to write the explicit gauge
transformation

ei(t) = t (cid:20)exp(cid:18)iz t

t0

dt i(t)gi(cid:19)(cid:21) = e(t)(t)e(t)t ,

t = t  t0

 (t) = ei(t)(t)ei(t) = e(t)t(t)e(t)t = (t0) = t + ii(t0)gi

(where we dene t to vary t while keeping t  t0 xed). thus, we can gauge  to
its value at a xed time t0. another way to see this is that varying i in the action
at a xed time gives gi = 0 at that time, but the remaining eld equations imply
.
gi = 0, so gi = 0 always, and i is redundant at other times. this means that if we
carelessly impose i = 0 at all times, we must also impose gi = 0 at some xed time.

note that this special gauge transformation itself has a very simple gauge trans-

formation: transforming the  in  by an arbitrary nite transformation  i(t),

ei(t) = eii(t)giei(t)eii(t0)gi

consistent with the transformation law of (t) above. thus, applying the trans-
formation  to any gauge-dependent quantity  gives a gauge-independent quantity
(, ), which is invariant under the local transformations (t) and transforms only
under the global transformations (t0). thus, xing the gauge (t) = 0 is equivalent
to working with gauge-invariant quantities.

178

iii. local

fixing an invariance of the action is not unique to gauge invariances: global
invariances also need to be xed, although the procedure is so trivial we seldom
discuss it. for example, even in nonrelativistic systems galilean invariance needs to
be xed: when analyzing a specic problem, we often choose some object to be at
rest (velocity transformations), choose another to be oriented or moving in a specic
direction (rotations), and choose a specic event to happen at the origin of space and
time (translations). alternatively, we can work with galilean invariants, just as in
gauge theories we can work with gauge invariants; however, in practice, for explicit
calculations (as opposed to discussing general properties), it is more convenient to x
the invariance, as this allows simplication of the equations.

the simplest relativistic actions are those for the mechanics (as opposed to eld
theory) of particles. these also give the simplest examples of gauge invariance in rela-
tivistic theories. later we will nd that various properties of the quantum mechanics
of these actions help to explain some features of quantum eld theory.

1. free

for nonrelativistic mechanics, the fact that the energy is expressed as a function of
the three-momentum is conjugate to the fact that the spatial coordinates are expressed
as functions of the time coordinate. in the relativistic generalization, all the spacetime
coordinates are expressed as functions of a parameter  : all the points that a particle
occupies in spacetime form a curve, or worldline, and we can parametrize this curve
in an arbitrary way. such parameters generally can be useful to describe curves: a
circle is better described by x(), y() than y(x) (avoiding ambiguities in square roots),
and a cycloid can be described explicitly only this way.

the action for a free, spinless particle then can be written in relativistic hamil-

tonian form as

sh =z d [ .

xmpm + v 1

2(p2 + m2)]

where v is a lagrange multiplier enforcing the constraint p2 + m2 = 0. this ac-
tion is very similar to nonrelativistic ones, but instead of xi(t), pi(t) we now have
xm( ), pm( ), v( ) (where .  now means d/d ). the gauge invariance generated by
p2 + m2 is

x = p,

p = 0,

v =

.


a more recognizable form of this invariance can be obtained by noting that any

action s(a) has invariances of the form

a = ab s
b ,

ab = ba

which have no physical signicance, since they vanish by the equations of motion. in
this case we can add

and set  = v to get

iii. local

we then can recognize this as a (innitesimal) coordinate transformation for  :

x() = x( ),

p() = p( ),

dv() = d v( );

 =   ( )

the transformation laws for x and p identify them as scalars with respect to these
one-dimensional (worldline) coordinate transformations (but they are vectors with
respect to d-dimensional spacetime). on the other hand, v transforms as a density:
the volume element d v of the world line transforms as a scalar. this gives us
a way to measure length on the worldline in a way independent of the choice of 
parametrization. because of this geometric interpretation, we are led to constrain

v > 0

so that any segment of the worldline will have positive length. because of this re-
striction, v is not a lagrange multiplier in the usual sense. this has signicant
physical consequences: p2 + m2 is treated neither as a constraint nor as the hamil-
tonian. while in nonrelativistic theories the schrodinger equation is (e  h) = 0
and gi = 0 is imposed on the initial states, in relativistic theories (p2 + m2) = 0
is the schrodinger equation: this is more like h = 0, since p2 already contains the
necessary e dependence.

the lagrangian form of the free particle action follows from eliminating p by its

equation of motion vp =

.
x:

sl =z d 1

2(vm2  v1 .
x2)

for m 6= 0, we can also eliminate v by its equation of motion v2 .
x2 = mz dx2 = mz ds = ms

s = mz d .

x2 + m2 = 0:

the action then has the purely geometrical interpretation as the proper time; how-
ever, this last form of the action is awkward to use because of the square root, and
doesnt apply to the massless case. note that the v equation implies ds = m(d v),
relating the intrinsic length of the worldline (as measured with the worldline vol-
ume element) to its extrinsic length (as measured by the spacetime metric). as a
consequence, in the massive case we also have the usual relation between momentum
and velocity

pm = m

(note that p0 is the energy, not p0.)

note that the gauge transformation of v, v =
nates x and momenta p, so that choosing the gauge v = 1 avoids any extraneous x
or p dependence that could arise from the gauge xing. (the appearance of such de-

pendence will be discussed in later chapters.) since t =r d v, the intrinsic length,

is gauge invariant, that part of v still remains when the length is nite, but it can be
.
incorporated into the limits of integration: the gauge v = 1 is maintained by
 = 0,
and this constant  can be used to gauge one limit of integration to zero, completely
0 , where t  0 (since
originally v > 0), and t is a variable to vary in the action. the gauge-xed action is
then

xing the gauge (i.e., the choice of  ). we then integrate r t

sh,ap =z t

0

d [ .

xmpm + 1

2(p2 + m2)]

in the massive case, we can instead choose the gauge v = 1/m; then the equations
of motion imply that  is the proper time. the hamiltonian p2/2m + constant then
resembles the nonrelativistic one.

another useful gauge is the lightcone gauge

 =

x+
p+

which, unlike the poincare covariant gauge v = 1, xes  completely; since the gauge
variation (x+/p+) = , we must set  = 0 to maintain the gauge. also, the gauge
transformation is again x and p independent. in lightcone gauges we always assume
p+ 6= 0, since we often divide by it. this is usually not too dangerous an assumption,
since we can treat p+ = 0 as a limiting case (in d>2).

we saw from our study of constrained systems that, for every degree of freedom we
can gauge away, the conjugate variable can be xed by the constraint that generates
that gauge invariance: in the case where the constraint is p, the gauge transformation
is q = , so we gauge q = 0 and use the constraint p = 0. in lightcone gauges the
constraints are almost linear: the gauge condition is x+ = p+ and the constraint is
p = ..., so the lagrange multiplier v is varied to determine p. on the other hand,
varying p gives

p  v = 1

so this gauge is a special case of the gauge v = 1. an important point is that we used
only auxiliary equations of motion: those not involving time derivatives. (a slight

trick involves the factor of p+: this is a constant by the equations of motion, so we

p+ terms. however, technically we should not use that equation of motion;

instead, we can redene x  x + ..., which will generate terms to cancel any
terms.) the net result of gauge xing and the auxiliary equation on the action is

sh,lc =z 



d [

xp+  .

xipi + 1

2(pi2 + m2)]

where xa = (x+, x, xi), etc. in particular, since we have xed one more gauge degree
of freedom (corresponding to constant ), we have also eliminated one more constraint
variable (t , the constant part of v). this is one of the main advantages of lightcone
gauges: they are unitary, eliminating all unphysical degrees of freedom.

exercise iiib2.1

another obvious gauge is  = x0, which works as well as the lightcone gauge
as far as eliminating worldline coordinate invariance is concerned. (the same
is true for  = n  x for any constant vector n.)

a consider the auxiliary equations of motion: apply this gauge condition; then
p0 appears without time derivatives, so eliminate it and v by their equations
of motion. show this gauge is consistent only for p0 > 0.

b the resulting square root is awkward except in the nonrelativistic limit: take

it, and compare with the usual nonrelativistic mechanics.

c a better type of gauge is  = n  x/n  p, what we actually used for the
lightcone. compare the value of v that results from the eld equations in this
case to that of the case  = n x. discuss the consistency of this case in terms
of the allowed signs of n  x and n  p vs. those of  and v.

3. coupling

one way to introduce external elds into the mechanics action is by considering

the most general lagrangian quadratic in  derivatives:

sl =z d [ 1

2 v1gmn(x)

.
xm .

xn + am(x)

.
xm + v(x)]

in the free case we have constant elds gmn = mn, am = 0, and  = 1
2 m2. the v
dependence has been assigned consistent with worldline coordinate invariance. the
curved-space metric tensor gmn describes gravity, the d-vector potential am describes
electromagnetism, and  is a scalar eld that can be used to introduce mass by
interaction.

the fermionic derivative d. find the coupling to a magnetic eld, in terms
of the 3-vector potential ai(x).
integrate the lagrangian over . show
that the quantum mechanical square of i[pi + ai(x)] is proportional to the

 (v1 .

xn = 0

by varying the lagrangian form of the action for the relativistic particle, in
an external electromagnetic eld (but at metric), with respect to x.

this action also has very simple transformation properties under d-dimensional

gauge transformations on the external elds:

gmn = ppgmn + gp(mn)p,

am = ppam + apmp  m,
 sl[x] + sl[x] = sl[x + ]  (xf ) + (xi)

 = pp

where we have integrated the action r f

i

transformations have a very natural interpretation in the quantum theory, where

d and set x(i) = xi, x(f ) = xf . these

z dx eis = hxf|xii

then the  transformation of a is canceled by the u(1) (phase) transformation

(x) = ei(x)(x)

in the inner product

hf|ii =z dxf dxi hf|xfihxf|xiihxi|ii =z dxf dxi f *(xf )hxf|xiii(xi)

while the  transformation associated with gmn is canceled by the d-dimensional
coordinate transformation

4. conservation

(x) = (x + )

there are two types of conservation laws generally found in physics: in mechanics
.
q = 0, associated with a

we usually have global conservation laws, of the form
symmetry of the hamiltonian h generated by a conserved quantity q:

.
0 = h = i[q, h] = 
q

186

iii. local

on the other hand, in eld theory we have local conservation laws, since the action

for a eld is written as an integralr ddx of a lagrangian density that depends only

on elds at x, and a nite number of their derivatives. the local conservation law
implies a global one, since

mj m = 0  0 =z

ddx
(2)d/2 mj m

dtz dd1x

(2)d/2 j 0 =

.
q = 0

where we have integrated over a volume whose boundaries in space are at inn-
ity (where j vanishes), and whose boundaries in time are innitesimally separated.
equivalently, the global symmetry is a special case of the local one.

a simple way to derive the local conservation laws is by coupling gauge elds: we
couple the electromagnetic eld am to arbitrary charged matter elds  and demand
gauge invariance of the matter part of the action, the matter-free part of the action
being separately invariant. we then have

0 = sm =z dx(cid:20)(am)

sm
am

+ ()

sm

 (cid:21)

using just the denition of the functional derivative /. applying the matter eld
equations sm / = 0, integration by parts, and the gauge transformation am =
m, we nd

0 =z dx (cid:18)m

sm

am(cid:19)  j m =

sm
am

,

mj m = 0

similar remarks apply to gravity, but only if we evaluate the current, in this case the
energy-momentum tensor, in at space gmn = mn, since gravity is self-interacting.
we then nd

where the normalization factor of 2 will be found later for consistency with the
particle. in this case the corresponding charge is the d-momentum:

t mn = 2

,

mt mn = 0

sm

gmn(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)gmn=mn
p m =z dd1x

(2)d/2 t 0m

in particular we see that the condition for the energy in any region of space to be
nonnegative is

show that the local conservation of the energy-momentum tensor allows def-
inition of a conserved angular momentum

j mn =z dd1x

(2)d/2 x[mt n]0

b. particles

187

show this result (local conservation of energy-momentum inplies local con-
servation of angular momentum) is the same as that of exercise ia4.1.

to apply this to the action for the particle in external elds, we must rst dis-
tinguish the particle coordinates x( ) from coordinates x for all of spacetime: the
particle exists only at x = x( ) for some  , but the elds exist at all x.
in this
notation we can write the mechanics action as

sl =z dx(cid:20)  gmn(x)z d (x  x) 1
+am(x)z d (x  x)
usingr dx (x  x( )) = 1. we then have

x m .
x n

2v1 .
x m + (x)z d (x  x)v(cid:21)
.

note that t 00  0 (since v > 0). integrating to nd the charge and momentum:

.
x m

x m .
x n

j m(x) =z d (x  x)
t mn =z d (x  x)v1 .
x 0 =z dx 0 (
x m =z dx 0 (

x 0 .

.

q =z d (x0  x 0)
p m =z d (x0  x 0)v1 .

.
x 0)(x0  x 0) = (p0)
x 0)(x0  x 0)v1 .
.

x m = (p0)pm

where we have used p = v1 .
x (for the free particle), where p is the momentum
conjugate to x, not to be confused with p . the factor of (p0) ((u) = u/|u| is the
sign of u) comes from the jacobian from changing integration variables from  to x 0.

the result is that our naive expectations for the momentum and charge of the
in particular p0, which semi-
particle can dier from the correct result by a sign.
classically is identied with the angular frequency of the corresponding wave, can
be either positive or negative, while the true energy p 0 = |p0| is always positive, as
physically required. (otherwise all states could decay into lower-energy ones: there
would be no lowest-energy state, the vacuum.) when p0 is negative, the charge q
and dx 0/d are also negative. in the massive case, we also have dx 0/ds negative.
this means that as the proper time s increases, x 0 decreases. since the proper time
is the time as measured in the rest frame of the particle, this means that the particle
is traveling backward in time: its clock changes in the direction opposite to that of
the coordinate system xm. particles traveling backward in time are called antiparti-
cles, and have charges opposite to their corresponding particles. they have positive
true energy, but the energy p0 conjugate to the time is negative.

exercise iiib4.2

compare these expressions for the current and energy-momentum tensor to
those from the semiclassical expansion in exercise iiia4.1. (include the in-
verse metric to dene the square of ms + qam there.)

5. pair creation

free particles travel in straight lines. nonrelativistically, external elds can alter
the motion of a particle to the extent of changing the signs of spatial components of
the momentum. relativistically, we might then expect that interactions could also
change the sign of the energy, or at least the canonical energy p0. as an extreme case,
consider a worldline that is a closed loop: we can pick  as an angular coordinate
around the loop. as  increases, x 0 will either increase or decrease. for example, a
circle in the x0-x1 plane will be viewed by the particle as repeating its history after
some nite  , moving forward with respect to time x0 until reaching a latest time tf ,
and then backward until some earliest time ti. on the other hand, from the point of
view of an observer at rest with respect to the xm coordinate system, there are no
particles until x0 = ti, at which time both a particle and an antiparticle appear at
the same position in space, move away from each other, and then come back together
and disappear. this process is known as pair creation and annihilation.

whether such a process can actually occur is determined by solving the equations
of motion. a simple example is a particle in the presence of only a static electric
eld, produced by the time component a0 of the potential. we consider the case of a
piecewise constant potential, vanishing outside a certain region and constant inside.
then the electric eld vanishes except at the boundaries, so the particle travels in
straight lines except at the boundaries. for simplicity we reduce the problem to two
dimensions:

for some constant v . the action is, in hamiltonian form,

a0 = v f or 0  x1  l,
sh =z d { .

.
p1 = ...
where e is a constant (the canonical energy at x1 = ) and the equation
is redundant because of gauge invariance. we assume e > 0, so initially we have a
particle and not an antiparticle.

we look only at the cases where the worldline begins at x0 = x1 =  (lower
left) and continues toward the right till it reaches x0 = x1 = + (upper right), so
that p1 = v1 .
x1 > 0 everywhere (no reection). however, the worldline might bend

x0 < 0) inside the potential: to the outside viewer, this looks
backward in time (
like pair creation at the right edge before the rst particle reaches the left edge; the
antiparticle then annihilates the original particle when it reaches the left edge, while
the new particle continues on to the right. from the particles point of view, it has
simply traveled backward in time so that it exits the right of the potential before it
enters the left, but it is the same particle that travels out the right as came in the
left. the velocity of the particle outside and inside the potential is

dx1

dx0 =

from the sign of the velocity we then see that we have normal transmission (no
antiparticles) for e > m + v and e > m, and pair creation/annihilation when

v  m > e > m  v > 2m

the true kinetic energy of the antiparticle (which appears only inside the potential)
is then (e  v ) > m.
exercise iiib5.1

this solution might seem to violate causality. however, in mechanics as well
as eld theory, causality is related to boundary conditions at innite times.
describe another solution to the equations of motion that would be inter-
preted by an outside observer as pair creation without any initial particles:
what happens ultimately to the particle and antiparticle? what are the al-
lowed values of their kinetic energies (maximum and minimum)? since many

iii. local

such pairs can be created by the potential alone, it can be accidental (and not
acausal) that an external particle meets up with such an antiparticle. note
that the generator of the potential, to maintain its value, continuously loses
energy (and charge) by emitting these particles.

the concept of a covariant derivative allows the straightforward generalization
of electromagnetism to a self-interacting theory, once u(1) has been generalized to a
nonabelian group. yang-mills theory is an essential part of the standard model.

1. nonabelian

the group u(1) of electromagnetism is abelian: group elements commute, which
makes group multiplication equivalent to multiplication of real numbers, or addition
if we write u = eig. the linearity of this addition is directly related to the linearity
of the eld equations for electromagnetism without matter. on the other hand, the
nonlinearity of nonabelian groups causes the corresponding particles to interact with
themselves: photons are neutral, but gluons have charge and gravitons have
weight.

in coupling electromagnetism to the particle, the relation of the canonical mo-
mentum to the velocity is modied: classically, the covariant momentum is dx/d =
p + qa for a particle of charge q (e.g., q = 1 for the proton). quantum mechanically,
the net eect is that the wave equation is modied by the replacement

   =  + iqa

which accounts for all dependence on a (minimal coupling). this covariant deriva-
tive has a fundamental role in the formulation of gauge theories, including gravity.
its main purpose is to preserve gauge invariance of the action that gives the wave
equation, which would otherwise be spoiled by derivatives acting on the coordinate-
dependent gauge parameters: in electromagnetism,

 = eiq, a = a    () = eiq()

or more simply

 = eiqeiq

(more generally, q is some hermitian matrix when  is a reducible representation of
u(1).)

yang-mills theory then can be obtained as a straightforward generalization of elec-
tromagnetism, the only dierence being that the gauge transformation, and therefore
the covariant derivative, now depends on the generators of some nonabelian group.
we begin with the hermitian generators

[gi, gj] = ifij

kgk,

gi = gi

192

iii. local

and exponentiate linear combinations of them to obtain the unitary group elements

i* = i  g = g1
we then can dene representations of the group (see subsection ib1)

 = igi;

g = ei,

 = ei,  = ei;

(gi)a = (gi)a

bb

for compact groups charge is quantized: for example, for su(2) the spin (or, for
internal symmetry, isospin) is integral or half-integral. on the other hand, with
abelian groups the charge can take continuous values: for example, in principle the
proton might decay into a particle of charge  and another of charge 1  . the
experimental fact that charge is quantized suggests already semiclassically that all
interactions should be descibed by (semi)simple groups.

if  is coordinate dependent (a local, or gauge transformation), the ordinary

partial derivative spoils gauge covariance, so we introduce the covariant derivative

a = a + iaa,

aa = aa

igi

thus, the covariant derivative acts on matter in a way similar to the innitesimal
gauge transformation,

a = iigia

bb,

aa = aa + iaa

igia

bb

gauge covariance is preserved by demanding it have a covariant transformation law

 = eiei  a = [, ] =   i[a, ]

the gauge covariance of the eld strength follows from dening it in a manifestly
covariant way:

[a,b] = ifab  f  = eif ei, fab = fab
kfjk
jab

i = [aab]

 fab

igi = [aab] + i[aa, ab]

i + aa

i

the jacobi identity for the covariant derivative is the bianchi identity for the eld
strength:

0 = [[a, [b,c]]] = i[[a, fbc]]

(if we choose instead to use antihermitian generators, all the explicit is go away;
however, with hermitian generators the is will cancel with those from the derivatives
when we fourier transform for purposes of quantization.) since the adjoint represen-
tation can be treated as either matrices or vectors (see subsection ib2), the covariant

c. yang-mills

193

derivative on it can be written as either a commutator or multiplication: for example,
we may write either [, f ] or f , depending on the context.

actions then can be constructed in a manifestly covariant way: for matter, we
take a lagrangian lm,0(, ) that is invariant under global (constant) group trans-
formations, and couple to yang-mills as

lm,0(, )  lm,a = lm,0(, )

(this is the analog of minimal coupling in electrodynamics.) the representation we
use for gi in a = a + iai
agi is determined by how  represents the group. (for
an abelian group factor u(1), g is just the charge q, in multiples of the g for that
factor.) for example, the lagrangian for a massless scalar is simply

(normalized for a complex representation).

l0 = 1

2(a)(a)

for the part of the action describing yang-mills itself we take (in analogy to the

u(1) case)

la(ai

a) = 1
8g2
a

f iabf j

abij

where ij is the cartan metric (see subsection ib2). this way of writing the action
is independent of our choice of normalization of the structure constants, and so gives
one unambiguous denition for the normalization of the coupling constant g. (it is
invariant under any simultaneous redenition of the elds and the generators that
leaves the covariant derivative invariant.) generally, for simple groups we can choose
to (ortho)normalize the generators gi with the condition (see subsection ib2)

ij = caij

for some constant ca; for groups that are products of simple groups (semisimple),
we might choose dierent normalization factors (but, of course, also dierent gs) for
each simple group. for abelian groups (u(1) factors) ij = 0, but then the gauge
eld has no self-interactions, so the normalization of the coupling constant is dened
only by matter terms in the action, and we can replace ij with ij in the above.

usually it will prove more convenient to use matrix notation: choosing some

convenient representation r of gi (not necessarily the adjoint), we write

la(ai

a) = 1
8g2
r

trr f abfab

the normalization of the trace is determined by r, and thus so is the normalization
convention for the coupling constant; a change in the representation used in the action

194

iii. local

can also be absorbed by a redenition of the coupling. for example, comparing the
dening and adjoint representations of su(n) (see subsection ib2),

la = 1
8g2
d

trd f abfab = 1
8g2
a

tra f abfab  g2

a = 2ng2
d

in general, we specify our normalization of the structure constants by xing cr for
some r, and our normalization of the coupling constant by specifying the choice of
representation used in the trace (or use explicit adjoint indices). as a rule, we nd
the most convenient choices of normalization are

cd = 1,

g = gd

(see subsection ib5).

exercise iiic1.1

write the action for su(n) yang-mills coupled to a massless (2-component)
spinor in the dening representation. make all (internal and lorentz) indices
explicit (no tr, etc.), and use dening (n-component) indices on the yang-
mills eld.

we have chosen a normalization where the yang-mills coupling constant g appears
only as an overall factor multiplying the f 2 term (and similarly for the electromagnetic
coupling, as discussed in previous chapters). an alternative is to rescale a  ga and
f  gf everywhere; then  =  + iga and f = a + ig[a, a], and the f 2 term has
no extra factor. this allows the yang-mills coupling to be treated similarly to other
couplings, which are usually not written multiplying kinetic terms (unless analogies to
yang-mills are being drawn), since (almost) only for yang-mills is there a nonlinear
symmetry relating kinetic and interaction terms.

current conservation works a bit dierently in the nonabelian case: applying
the same argument as in subsection iiib4, but taking into account the modied
(innitesimal) gauge transformation law, we nd

j m =

sm
am

,

mj m = 0

since mj m 6= 0, there is no corresponding covariant conserved charge.

is conserved. the j term can be considered the gluon contribution to the
current: unlike photons, gluons are charged. although the current is gauge
dependent, and thus physically meaningless, the corresponding charge can
be gauge independent under situations where the boundary conditions are
suitable.

2. lightcone

since gauge parameters are always of the same form as the gauge eld, but with
one less vector index, an obvious type of gauge choice (at least from the point of view
of counting components) is to require the gauge eld to vanish when one vector index
is xed to a certain value. explicitly, in terms of the covariant derivative we set

n   = n    n  a = 0

for some constant vector na. we then can distinguish three types of axial gauges:

.
ai  1

ai)2 + 1

8(fij)2

196

iii. local

(1) arnowitt-fickler, or spacelike (n2 > 0),

(2) lightcone, or lightlike (n2 = 0), and

(3) temporal, or timelike (n2 < 0).

by appropriate choice of reference frame, and with the usual notation, we can write
these gauge conditions as 1 = 1, + = +, and 0 = 0.

one way to apply this gauge in the action is to keep the same set of elds, but
have explicit n dependence. a much simpler choice is to use a gauge choice such as
a0 = 0 simply to eliminate a0 explicitly from the action. for example, for yang-mills
we nd

.

8(fab)2 =  1
4 (

a0 = 0  f0i =
where 
 here refers to the time derivative. canonical quantization is simple in
this gauge, because we have the canonical time-derivative term. however, the gauge
condition cant be imposed everywhere, as seen for the corresponding gauge for the
one-dimensional metric in subsection iiib2, and in our general discussion in subsec-
tion iiia5: here we can generalize the time-ordered integral for the temporal gauge
to an integral path-ordered with respect to a straight-line path in the n direction:

ekn(x) = ei(x,xkn)ekn,

ei(x,xkn) = p(cid:20)exp(cid:18)iz x

xkn

dx  a(x)(cid:19)(cid:21)

applying this gauge transformation to n  , as in subsection iiia5, xes n  a to a
constant with respect to n  ; the eect on all of  is:

(x) = ei(x,xkn)(x)ei(x,xkn)  (x + kn) = ekn(x)(x)ekn(x)

for example, for the temporal gauge, if we choose x to be on the initial hypersurface
x0 = t0, then we can choose k = t  t0 so that  is evaluated at arbitrary time t:

a(x) = [(ek0(x)a(x)ek0(x))|x0=t0]|k=x0

by taylor expanding in k, this gives an explicit expression for aa at all times in terms
of aa, and fab and its covariant time-derivatives, evaluated at some initial time, but
with simply a0(t, xi) = a0(t0, xi). thus, we still need to impose the a0 eld equation
[i,

.
ai] = 0 as a constraint at some initial time.

exercise iiic2.1

first set a0 = 0, then derive the eld equations for ai from the yang-mills
action. compare the results of exercise iiic1.2c for j = 0. show explicitly
.
that these eld equations imply the time derivative of the constraint [i,
ai] =
0. (hint: write everything in terms of f s and s till the end.)

197

in the case of the lightcone gauge we can carry this analysis one step further.
in subsection iib3 we saw that lightcone formalisms are described by massless elds
with (d2)-dimensional (transverse) indices. in the present analysis, gauge xing
alone gives us, again for the example of pure yang-mills,

a+ = 0  f +i = +ai, f + = +a, f i = ai  [i, a]
8(f ij)2
 1

2 (+ai)(ai  [i, a]) + 1

4 (+a)2  1

8(f ab)2 =  1

in the lightcone formalism  (+) is to be treated as a time derivative, while
+ can be freely inverted (i.e., modes propagate to innity in the x+ direction, but
boundary conditions set them to vanish in the x direction). thus, we can treat a
as an auxiliary eld. the solution to its eld equation is

a =

1
+2 [i, +ai]

which can be substituted directly into the action:

1

8(f ab)2 = 1

2ai+ai + 1

1
+ [aj, +aj]

2 (iai)
1
+2 [aj, +aj]

4 [ai, +ai]

we can save a couple of steps in this derivation by noting that elimination of any
auxiliary eld, appearing quadratically (as in going from hamiltonian to lagrangian
formalisms), has the eect

l = 1

2ax2 + bx + c   1

2 ax2|l/x=0 + l|x=0

in this case, the quadratic term is (f +)2, and we have

1

8(f ab)2 = 1

2 f +if i  1
where the last term is evaluated at

8(f ij)2  1

in this case, canonical quantization is even simpler, since interpreting  as the
time derivative makes the action look like that for a nonrelativistic eld theory, with

198

iii. local

a kinetic term linear in time derivatives (as well as interactions without them). the
free part of the eld equation is also simpler, since the kinetic operator is now just
. (this is true in general in lightcone formalisms from the analysis of free theories
in chapter xii.) in general, lightcone gauges are the simplest for analyzing physical
degrees of freedom (within perturbation theory), since the maximum number of de-
grees of freedom is eliminated, and thus kinetic operators look like those of scalars.
on the other hand, interaction terms are more complicated because of the nonlo-
cal coulomb-like terms involving 1/+: the inverse of a derivative is an integral.
(however, in practice we often work in momentum space, where 1/p+ is local, but
fourier transformation itself introduces multiple integrals.) this makes lightcone
gauges useful for discussing unitarity (they are unitary gauges), but inconvenient
for explicit calculations. however, in subsection vib6 well nd a slight modication
of the lightcone that makes it the most convenient method for certain calculations.
(in the literature, lightcone gauge is sometimes used to refer to an axial gauge
where a+ is set to vanish but a is not eliminated, and d-vector notation is still
used, so unitarity is not manifest. here we always eliminate both components and
explicitly use (d  2)-vectors, which has distinct technical advantages.)

although spin 1/2 has no gauge invariance, the second step of the lightcone
formalism, eliminating auxiliary elds, can also be applied there: for example, for a
.
massless spinor in d=4, identifying 
 =  as the lightcone time derivative, we

vary 
 (or ) as the auxiliary eld:

this tells us that a 4d massless spinor, like a 4d massless vector (or a complex scalar)
has only 1 complex (2 real) degree of freedom, describing a particle of helicity +1/2
and its antiparticle of helicity 1/2 (1 for the vector, 0 for the scalar), in agreement
with our general discussion of helicity in subsection iib7. on the other hand, in the
massive case we can always go to a rest frame, so the analysis is in terms of spin
(su(2) for d=4) rather than helicity. for a massive weyl spinor we can perform the
same analysis as above, with the modications

where we have dropped some terms that vanish upon using integration by parts and
the antisymmetry of the fermions. so now we have the two states of an su(2) spinor,
but these are identied with their antiparticles. this diers from the vector: while

for the spinor we have 2 states of a given energy for both the massless and massive
cases, for a vector we have 2 for the massless but 3 for the massive, since for su(2)
spin s has 2s+1 states:

exercise iiic2.2

show that integration by parts for 1/ gives just a sign change, just as for .

in general dimensions, massless particles are representations of the little group
so(d2) (the helicity so(2) in d=4), as described in subsection iib3. massive
particles represent the little group so(d1), corresponding to dimensional reduction
from an extra dimension, as described in subsection iib4.

3. plane waves

the simplest nontrivial solutions to nonabelian eld equations are the general-

izations of the plane wave solutions of the free theory. we begin with general, free,
massless theories, as analyzed in subsection iib3. in the lightcone frame only p+ is
nonvanishing. in position space this means the eld strength depends only on x.
this describes a wave traveling at the speed of light in the positive x1 direction, with
no other spatial dependence (i.e., a plane wave). we allow arbitrary dependence on
x, corresponding to a superposition of waves with parallel momenta (but dierent
values of p+). while its dependence on only x solves the klein-gordon equation,
maxwells equations are solved by giving the eld strength as many upper + indices
as possible, and no upper s.

generalizing to interactions, we notice that the yang-mills eld equations and
bianchi identities dier from maxwells equations only by the covariantization of the
derivatives (at least for pure yang-mills). because maxwells equations were satised
by just restricting the index structure, we can do the same for the covariant derivatives
by assuming that only + is novanishing on the eld strengths. in other words, we
can solve the eld equations and bianchi identities by choosing the only nontrivial
components of the gauge elds to be those in +.

200

iii. local

the nal step is to solve the relation between covariant derivative and eld
strength. this is simple because the index structure we found implies the only non-
trvial commutators are

[i,+] = if i+,

[,+] = 0

in particular, this implies that the gauge elds have no x+ dependence, and only a
very simple dependence on xi. we nd directly

a+ = xif i+(x)

where f i+(x) is unrestricted (other than the explicit index structure and coordinate
dependence). of course, this result can also be used in the free theory, although it
diers from the usual lightcone gauge.

exercise iiic3.1

gauge transform this solution to the lightcone gauge a+ = 0 in the abelian
case.

exercise iiic3.2

translate the above results into spinor notation in d=4.

4. self-duality

the simplest and most important solutions to the eld equations are those that
are invariant under the duality symmetry that relates electric and magnetic charge:

[a,b] =  1

2abcd[c,d]

applying the self-duality condition twice, we nd

abef ef cd = +c

[ad
b]

which requires an even number of time dimensions. for example, since the action
is usually wick rotated anyway for perturbative purposes, we might assume that
we should do the same for classical solutions that are not considered as small
uctations about the usual vacuum.
(such a euclidean denition of eld theory
has been considered for a mathematically rigorous formalism, called constructive
quantum eld theory, since the gaussian path integrals for scalars and vectors are
then well-dened and convergent. however, other spins, such as for fermions or
gravity, are a problem in this approach.) alternatively, we can replace abcd with

c. yang-mills

201

iabcd and complexify our elds. the self-duality condition, when combined with the
bianchi identities, implies the eld equations: for yang-mills,

[afbc] = 0  0 =  1

2 abcdafbc = 1

4abcdabcef f ef = af ad

since the self-duality condition is only rst-order in derivatives, its easier to solve
than the usual eld equations.

plane wave solutions provide a simple example of self-duality, since the eld
strengths can easily be written as the sum of self-dual and anti-self-dual parts: in
.
minkowski space we dene the self-dual part as helicity +1 (f .
), and anti-self-dual
as 1 (f). for example, for a wave traveling in the 1 direction, the f +2  if +3
components give the two self-dualities for yang-mills, describing helicities 1 (the
two circular polarizations).

exercise iiic4.1

generalize the results of the previous subsection to more general waves, with
an a+ which is a general function of x and xi (with the other components
of a still vanishing).

a find the eld strength, and show it satises the interacting eld equations if

a+ satises the free laplace equation

(i)2a+ = 0

b in d=4, the solution to this equation is

a+ = f (x, xt) + f (x, xt)

show this decomposition describes the two separate helicities.

before further analyzing solutions to the self-duality condition, we consider ac-
tions that use self-dual elds directly. this will allow us to describe not only theories
whose only solutions are self-dual, but also more standard theories as perturbations
about self-duality, and even massive theories. the most unusual feature of this ap-
proach is that complex elds are used without their complex conjugates, since this
is implied in d=3+1 by self-duality. (alternatively, we can wick rotate to 2+2 di-
mensions, where all lorentz representations are real.) there are two stages to this
approach: (1) use a rst-order formalism where the auxiliary eld is self-dual. the
usual rst-order actions for spin 1/2 (weyl or dirac) already can be interpreted in
this way, where self-duality means chirality. (2) for the massive theory, elimi-
nate the non-self-dual eld (as an auxiliary eld, as allowed by the mass term), so

202

iii. local

that the dynamics is described by the self-dual eld, which was formerly considered
as auxiliary. the massless theory then can be treated as a limiting case.

the simplest (and perhaps most useful) example is massive spin 1/2 coupled in

a real representation to yang-mills elds:
.  . + 1
22

l = t i

m(t  + t .  .)

where the transposition (t ) refers to the yang-mills group index (with respect to
which the spinors are column vectors). note that  must be a real representation of
this group (at = a) for the mass term to be gauge invariant (unless the mass term
includes scalars: see the following chapter). even though  and  are complex conju-
gates, they can be treated independently as far as eld equations are concerned, since
they are just dierent linear combinations of their real and imaginary parts. (com-
plex conjugation can be treated as just a symmetry, related to unitarity.) noticing
that the quadratic term for  has no derivatives, we can treat it as an auxiliary eld,
and integrate it out (i.e., eliminate it by its equation of motion, which gives an explicit
local expression for it):

2
m [ 1

l  

4t (  m2) + 1

2 t if

]

where we have used the identity

. . = 1

2{

., .} + 1

2[



., .] =  1
2 

  if



whose simplicity followed from  being a real representation of the yang-mills group.
(of course, we could have eliminated  instead, but not both.) for convenience we
also scale  by a constant

  21/4m

to nd the nal result

l   1

4 t (  m2)  1

2 t if



now the massless limit can be taken easily. this action resembles that of a scalar, plus
a magnetic-moment coupling, which couples the (anti-)self-dual (chiral) spinor
 to only the (anti-)self-dual part f of the yang-mills eld strength.

for the same reason, the kinetic operator can be written in terms of just the

self-dual part s of the spin operator:

l =  1

4t (  m2  if s)

c. yang-mills

203

this operator is of the same form found by squaring the dirac operator:

2/ 2 = 2(  )2 = ({a, b} + [a, b])ab =  if absba

except for the self-duality. the simple form of this result again depends on the
reality (parity invariance) of the yang-mills representation; although this squaring
trick can be applied for complex representations (parity violating), the coupling does
not simplify. this is related to the fact that real representations are required for our
derivation of the self-dual form.

in the special case where the real representation is the direct sum of a complex
one + with its complex conjugate  (as for quarks in the standard model, or
electrons in electrodynamics), we can rewrite the lagrangian as

lc =  1

2 t 

+ (  m2)  t 

+ if



the method can also be generalized to the case of scalar couplings, but the action
becomes nonpolynomial.

for spin 1, we start with the massless case. we can write the lagrangian for

yang-mills as

l = tr(gf  1

2 g2g2

)

where g is a (anti-)self-dual auxiliary eld. although this action is complex, elim-
inating g by its algebraic eld equation gives the usual yang-mills action up to a
total derivative term (abcdfabfcd), which can be dropped for purposes of perturbation
theory. for g = 0, this is an action where g acts as a lagrange multiplier, enforcing
the self-duality of the yang-mills eld strength.

if we simply add a mass term

lm = 1

4 ( m

g )2a2

then a can be eliminated by its eld equation, giving a nonpolynomial action of the
form

l + lm   1

2 (g)[( m

g )2 + g]1(g)  1

2g2g2

just as the spin-1/2 action contained only a 2-component spinor describing the 2
polarizations of spin 1/2, this action contains only the 3-component g, describing
the 3 polarizations of (massive) spin 1.

exercise iiic4.2

find the abelian part of this action. show the free eld equation is
(  m2)g = 0 (without gauge xing).

204

iii. local

5. twistors

in four dimensions with an even number of time dimensions, the lorentz group
factorizes (into su(2)2 for d=4+0 and sl(2)2 for d=2+2). this makes self-duality
especially simple in spinor notation: for yang-mills (cf. electromagnetism in subsec-
tion iia7),

[

,

] = ic f 

(f  = 0)

where we have written primes instead of dots to emphasize that the two kinds of
indices transform independently (instead of as complex conjugates, as in d=3+1). for
purposes of analyzing self-duality within perturbation theory, we can use a lightcone
method that breaks only one of the two sl(2)s (or su(2)s), by separating out its
indices into the  and  components:

[

,

] = 0  

= 

where we have chosen a lightcone gauge: the vanishing of all eld strengths for the
covariant derivative  says that it is pure gauge (as seen by ignoring all but the
x coordinates). we now solve

[[

,]

] = 0  

= 

+ i



i.e.,    has vanishing curl, and is therefore a gradient. we therefore have

a

= 0, a

=

f 

= i





these can also be written in terms of an arbitrary constant twistor  (=

exercise iiic5.2

look at the action gf for self-dual yang-mills in the lightcone gauge,
using the results above. show that this action is equivalent to the lightcone
action for ordinary yang-mills (subsection iiic2), with some terms in the
interaction dropped.

at least for 4d yang-mills, advantage can be taken of the conformal invariance
of the classical interacting theory by using a formalism where this invariance is man-
ifest. we saw in subsection ia6 that classical mechanics could be made manifestly
conformal by use of extra coordinates. covariant derivatives can be dened in terms
of projective lightcone coordinates, but the twistor coordinates za (see subsections
iib6 and iiib1) are more useful. the self-dual covariant derivatives then satisfy

[a,b] = icfab

in direct analogy to 4d spinor notation. this equation also can be solved by the
lightcone method used above, but now this method breaks only the internal sl(2)
symmetry, leaving sl(4) conformal symmetry manifest. more general self-dual eld
strengths in this twistor space are also of the form fa...b, totally symmetric in the
indices. we also need to impose the constraint on the eld strength

zafab = 0

(and similarly for the more general case) to restrict the range of indices to the usual
4d spinor indices (in which the eld strengths are totally symmetric). self-duality
implies the bianchi identity

[afb]c = 0

which also generalizes to the other eld strengths, and is the equivalent of the usual
rst-order dierential equations (dirac, maxwell, etc.) satised by 4d eld strengths.
as usual, it in turn implies the interacting klein-gordon equation, which in the
yang-mills case is

1

2[a

b]fcd = i[fc[a, fb]d]

the bianchi together with the z index constraint imply the constraint on coordinate
dependence

(zaa + 

 )fbc = 0

which eliminates dependence on all but the usual 4d coordinates. these four equa-
tions are generically satised by self-dual eld strengths. the self-duality itself of the
eld strengths is a consequence of their total symmetry in their indices, and the fact

206

iii. local

that they are all lower (sl(4)) indices. (the z index constraint then reduces them to

sl(2) weyl indices all of the same chirality.)

exercise iiic5.3

derive the last three equations from the previous two (self-duality and zf =0).

exercise iiic5.4

show that non-self-dual yang-mills is conformally invariant in d=4 by extend-

ing the (4+2)-dimensional formalism of subsections ia6 and iiib1 (especially

exercise iiib1.4): show the eld strength

fabc = i 1

2 y[a[b,c]]

satises the gauge covariances

and bianchi identities

aa = [a, ]  ya

y[afbcd] = [afbcd] = 0

the duality transformation

fabc  1

6abcdef f def

then suggests the eld equations

yafabc = afabc = 0

in addition to the usual constraint

y2fabc = 0

by reducing to d=4 coordinates with the aid of the above yf conditions, show

f reduces to the usual eld strength, and the remaining equations reduce to

the usual gauge transformation, bianchi identity, duality, and eld equation.

207

6. instantons

another interesting class of self-dual solutions to yang-mills theory are instan-
tons, so called because the eld strength is maximum at points in spacetime, unlike
the plane waves, whose wavefronts propagate from and toward timelike innity. a
particular subset of these can be expressed in a very simple form by the t hooft
ansatz in terms of a scalar eld: in twistor notation, choosing the yang-mills gauge
group gl(2) (in 2+2 dimensions, or su(2)gl(1) for 4+0),

iaa

 = 

aln   iaa

 = aln 

so the gl(1) piece is pure gauge, and has been included just for convenience. note
that this ansatz ties the sl(2) twistor index with the sl(2) gauge group indices (, ),
but in this notation the index that carries the spacetime (conformal) symmetry is free.
imposing the self-duality condition on the eld strength, and separating out the terms
symmetric and antisymmetric in ab, we nd
2 (a
b = 0

 =  1
1a

b)1

ifab

the eld equation for  is just the twistor version of the (free) klein-gordon
equation, and its solution is the projective lightcone version of 4d point sources (see
subsection ia6): since for any two 6d lightlike vectors y and y

y = e(x, 1, 1

2 x2)  y  y =  1

2 ee(x  x)2

we have the solution

 =

k+1xi=1

(y  yi)1,

y2
i = 0

with y given in terms of z as before, and yi are constant null vectors. k is the number
of instantons. (the one term for k = 0 is pure gauge.) the usual singularities in
the klein-gordon equation at y = yi are killed by the extra factor of 1 in the eld
equation.

exercise iiic6.1

lets check the klein-gordon equation for y 6= yi directly in twistor space.
we will need the identity

i = 0  yia[byicd] = 0

y  yi = 1

a show it follows from the denition

y2
i = 1

4abcdyiabyicd

b show it follows from plugging in the solution to the lightlike condition,

yiab = zia

zib

c now use the identity to show the above solution satises its eld equation by

evaluating the z derivatives.

we can rewrite this in the usual 4d coordinates by transforming from za to 

and x as za = 

(

) (see subsection iib6):

dzaaa

a

 + [(d

)1

]zaaa

 = dx

a

  i1

d



where in the rst step we have used the expression for z in terms of  and x, and in
the second we used the result that

(zaa + 

 ) = 0

we now recognize that the gauge transformation that gets rid of all but the x
components of a (whose existence is guaranteed by the condition zafab = 0) uses
 itself as the gauge parameter:

dzaaa

 = i1

d

(dzaa

the net result is that a can be reduced to an ordinary 4-dimensional expression by
just setting  =  in the original expression. then

ia

ln ,

 =xi

1

ei(x  xi)2

with y in terms of x and a scale factor (worldline metric) e as in subsections ia6
and iiib1 (and dropping an overall factor that doesnt contribute to a). note that,
unlike the expression in twistor space, where conformal invariance is manifest, here
lorentz invariance is tied to the yang-mills symmetry.

exercise iiic6.2

show in 4d coordinates that the gauge-invariant quantity tr(f 2) is nite at

c. yang-mills

209

the points x = xi, where a is singular. (this means that the gauge choice is
singular, not physical quantities.)

another important property of instantons is that they give nite contributions to

the action. in vector notation, we have

f ab = 1

2abcdfcd  s = 1

(2)2 f abfab = 1

8g2 trz d4x

16g2 trz d4x

(2)2 abcdfabfcd

the last expression can be reduced to a boundary term, since

1

8tr f[abfcd] = 1

6[abbcd]

in terms of the chern-simons form

babc = tr( 1

2a[abac] + i 1

3 a[aabac])

exercise iiic6.3

although the chern-simons form is not manifestly invariant, its variation is,
up to a total derivative:

a show that its general variation is

babc = 1

2 tr[(a[a)fbc]  [aabac]]

b show the gauge transformation of b is

babc =  1

2[abc],

ab = 1

2 tr([aab])

if we assume boundary conditions such that f drops o rapidly at innity, then

a must drop o to pure gauge at innity:

iam  g1mg

since instantons always deal with an su(2) subgroup of the gauge group, well assume
now for simplicity that the whole group is itself su(2). then the action can be given
a group theory interpretation directly, since the integral over the surface at innity
is an integral over the 3-sphere, which covers the group space of so(3), and thus half
the group space of su(2). explicitly,

6ijktr(g1ig)(g1jg)(g1kg)

where in the last step we have switched to coordinates for the 3-sphere, using the fact

r d4x mnpqfmnpq is independent of coordinate choice. in fact, in the case where g is

a one-to-one map between the 3-sphere and the group so(3), this last expression is
just the denition of the invariant volume of the so(3) group space. in that case, the
integral gives just the volume of the 3-sphere (22). in general, the map g will cover
the su(2) group space an integer number q of times, and thus cover the so(3) group
space 2q times, so the result will be

s = |q|
2g2

where we have used the fact that self-dual solutions have q > 0 while anti-self-dual
have q < 0.

(anti-)self-dual solutions give relative minima of the action with respect to more

general eld congurations:

0  trz 1

2(fab  1

2abcdf cd)2 = trz (f 2  1
 s  |q|

2g2

2abcdfabfcd)

q is an integer, and thus cant be changed by continuous variations: it is a topological
property of nite-action congurations. thus the self-dual solutions give absolute
minima for a given topology. (all these solutions will be given implicitly by twistor
construction in the following subsection. note that our normalization for the structure
constants of su(2) diers from the usual, since we use eectively tr(gigj) = ij
instead of the more common tr(gigj) = 1
2ij, which would normalize the structure
constants as in so(3): fijk = ijk. the net eect is that our g2 contains a relative
extra factor of 1/2, in addition to the eective extra factors coming from our dierent
normalization of the action.)

exercise iiic6.4

explicitly evaluate the integral for the instanton number q for the solutions
of the t hooft ansatz. show that the asymptotic form can be expressed in
 = x. (det g 6= 1 because of the gl(1) piece.) note that
terms of (g)
there are boundary contributions not only at x =  but also around the
singular points x = xi, which are of the same form but opposite sign. (since
the singular parts of a are pure gauge, they cancel in f .)

at the quantum level, instantons are important mostly because they are an ex-

ample of elds that dont fall o rapidly at innity, and thus contribute to r f f .

c. yang-mills

211

however, once the restriction on boundary conditions is relaxed, there can be many
such eld congurations. the instantons are then distinguished by the fact that they
are the minimal action solutions for a given topology; this makes them important for
describing low-energy behavior.

7. adhm

much more general solutions of this form can be constructed using twistor meth-
ods. (in fact, they can be shown to be the most general self-dual solutions that fall
o fast enough at innity in all directions.) the rst step of the atiyah-drinfeld-
hitchin-manin (adhm) construction is to introduce a scalar square matrix in a larger
group space

the index  is the usual two-valued twistor index, for su(2) in euclidean space or

usp(2n) (sp(2n)) usp(2n+2k) (sp(2n+2k)) gl(k)

su(n+2k) (sl(n+2k))

so(n+4k)

the index  is for the dening representation of the yang-mills group h, which is
any of the compact classical groups for euclidean space, but is its real wick rotation
for 2+2 dimensions. the index i is for the dening representation of the group g,
a larger version of h, where k is the instanton number. finally, the index i is for a
general linear group. we also have the matrix

u i

i  = (ui

i)

for the so and (u)sp cases both u matrices are real, for the su case they are complex
conjugates of each other, and for the sl case they are real and independent. we next
relate the two us by

ui

so they are almost inverses of each other, except that the metric g is not constrained

iii. local

(this is similar to the method used for nonlinear  models of coset spaces g/h as
discussed in subsection iva3 below, except for g.)

self-duality then follows from requiring a certain coordinate dependence of the

us: this is xed by giving the explicit dependence of the vs as

vii = biiaza,

vi

i = bi

where the bs are constants. the orthonormality conditions on the us then implies
the constraint on the bs

bi

i(abiib) = 0

as well as determining the us in terms of the bs (with much messier dependence than
the vs), and thus a. note that the z dependence of u can be written in terms of just
x, as follows from rewriting the uv orthogonality as (after multiplying by z)

ui

biiayab = ui

iayab = 0

and noting scale invariance. then the x components of a can also be written in
terms of just x. we then can check the self-duality condition by calculating f : the
orthonormality condition on the us can be written as

8. monopoles

instantons are essentially 0-dimensional objects,

localized near a point in 4-
dimensional spacetime (or many points for multi-instanton solutions). another type
of solution is 1-dimensional; this represents a particle (with a 1d worldline). unlike
the plane-wave solutions, which represent the massless particles already described
explicitly by elds in the action, we now look for time-independent solutions, which
describe massive (since they have a rest frame), bound-state particles.

looking at time-independent solutions is similar to the dimensional reduction
that we considered in subsection iib4 to introduce masses into free theories, only
(1) this mass vanishes, and (2) we reduce the time dimension, not a spatial one. in
our case, the dimensional reduction of a 4-vector (the yang-mills potential) gives a
3-vector and a scalar, both in the adjoint representation of the group. lets consider
the reduction in euclidean space, so the scalar kinetic term comes out with the right
sign. then the 4d yang-mills action reduces as

4 [i, ]2

where we have labeled the scalar a0 =  and by dimensional reduction 0  0. note
that this is the same action that would have been obtained by starting out with yang-
mills coupled to an adjoint scalar in four dimensions, either minkowski or euclidean,
and choosing the gauge a0 = 0. thus, time-independent solutions to euclidean
yang-mills theory are also time-independent solutions to minkowskian yang-mills
coupled to an adjoint scalar (although not the most general, since the gauge a0 = 0
is not generally possible globally, especially when we assume time independence of
even gauge-dependent quantities). in particular, this means that time-independent
solutions to self-dual yang-mills are also solutions of minkowskian yang-mills cou-
pled to an adjoint scalar. this allows us to use the rst-order dierential equations
and topological properties of self-dual yang-mills theory to nd physical bound-state
particles in this vector-scalar theory.

dimensionally reducing the (euclidean) self-duality condition, we have

[i, ] = 1

2ijkfjk

as for instantons, the simplest solutions are for su(2). as for the t hooft ansatz,
we look for a solution that is covariant under the combined su(2) of the gauge group
and 3d rotations: in so(3) vector notation for both kinds of indices (using the so(3)
normalization of the structure constants [igi, igj] = ijkigk),

i = xi(r),

(ai)j = ijkxka(r)

(we know to use an  tensor in a because of covariance under parity.) the self-
duality equation then reduces to two nonlinear rst-order dierential equations (the

since wick rotation changes the sign of the kinetic energy and not the potential en-
ergy. in our case, this means the minkowskian energy of the yang-mills + adjoint
scalar theory can be evaluated in terms of the same topological expression we used for

instantons: from the previous subsection, using s =r dt e and 0 = 0, we evaluate
i0jkb0jk  ijktr(fjk) = 2 tr([i, ]) = i tr(2)

also by similar arguments to those used for instantons, we see that any solutions with

this. there is also a topological interpretation to this energy: writing it as

e =  1

162g2i d2i ijktr(hifjk)

we see that the energy is proportional to the magnetic ux, i.e., the magnetic charge
of the monopole. (the asymptotic value hi of  picks out a direction in isospace,
reducing su(2) to u(1).) as in electromagnetism, magnetic charge is quantized in
terms of electric charge. however, for compact gauge groups, electric charge is also
quantized. (for the usual u(1), charges are arbitrary, but for su(2), any component
of the isospin is quantized.) the energy is thus quantized in terms of k: it is a
multiple of the energy we found for the single monopole above.

exercise iiic8.2

perform a singular gauge transformation that makes hi point in a constant
(rather than radial) direction in isospin (su(2)) space. show that the isospin
component of the asymptotic form of a describes a u(1) magnetic monopole:

in this chapter we consider ways in which gauge symmetry combines with global
symmetries for new eects. the interplay between global internal symmetries of scalar
and spinor theories and local symmetries of yang-mills is important for understanding
mass generation for all spins, and is fundamental for the standard model.

symmetries, especially local ones, are clearly very important in the formulation of
interactions. however, symmetries are not always apparent in nature: for example,
while most symmetries prefer massless particles, of all the observed particles the only
massless ones are the graviton, photon, and neutrinos. furthermore, of the massive
ones, none with dierent properties have the same mass, although some are close
(e.g., the proton and neutron). there are three solutions to this problem:

(1) the symmetry is not a property of nature, but only an approximate symmetry.
some terms in the action are invariant under the symmetry, but other terms
violate it. we can treat such explicit symmetry breaking by rst studying the
symmetry for the invariant terms, and then treating the breaking terms as a
perturbation.

(2) although the laws of physics are symmetric, nature is an asymmetric solution to
them. in particular, such a solution is the vacuum, or state of lowest energy,
with respect to which all other states are dened. this case is called spontaneous
symmetry breaking.

(3) the particles in terms of which these laws are formulated are not those observed
in nature. for example, the hydrogen atom is most conveniently described in
terms of a proton and an electron, but in its low-energy physics only the atom
itself is observed as a separate entity: the u(1) symmetry related to charge is
not seen from the neutral atoms. the more extreme case where such particles
always appear in bound states is known as connement.

generally, such broken symmetries are at least partially restored at high energies.
for example, if the symmetry breaking introduces masses, or mass dierences between
related particles, then the symmetry may become apparent at energies large with
respect to those masses. similarly, a hydrogen atom excited to an energy much larger
than its lower energy levels will ionize to reveal its constituent particles.

it often is possible to change to a set of variables that are invariant under a
local symmetry. for example, if we can dene everywhere a variable that transforms

a. hidden symmetry

219

as (x) = (x), then it can be used to everywhere undo the invariance. we can
choose the gauge  = , transforming  to 0 everywhere, leaving no residual
invariance, or we can work with composite, invariant variables: e.g.,  = ei is
replaced (invertibly) with  = ei, so  = .

1. spontaneous breakdown

we rst consider symmetry breaking by the vacuum, known as spontaneous
breakdown. the action is invariant under the symmetry, but the vacuum state is not:
thus, the symmetry acting on the vacuum produces other zero-energy solutions to
the eld equations, but this symmetry is not apparent when considering perturbation
about the vacuum. in this case, although the symmetry is broken, there are obvious
residual eects, particularly if the breaking can be considered as small with respect
to some other eects.

the goldstone theorem is an important statement about the eect of symmetry
breakdown: if a continuous global symmetry is spontaneously broken, then there is a
corresponding massless scalar. the proof is simple: consider a (relative) minimum of
the potential, as the vacuum. by denition, we have spontaneous symmetry break-
ing if this minimum is not invariant under the continuous symmetry:
i.e., applying
innitesimal symmetry transformations gives a curve of nearby states, which have
the same energy, because the transformations are a symmetry of the theory. but
the mass of a scalar, by denition, is given by the quadratic term in its potential,
i.e., the second derivative of the potential evaluated at the vacuum value. (the rst
derivative vanishes because the vacuum is a minimum.) so, if we look at the scalar
dened to parametrize this curve of constant energy in eld space, its mass vanishes.
(this eld may be a function of the given elds, such as an angle in eld space.)

we can also formulate this more mathematically, for purposes of calculation:
consider a theory with potential v (i). (the lagrangian is v plus derivative terms.
for simplicity we consider just scalars.) the masses of the scalars are dened by
the quadratic term in the potential, expanding about a minimum, the vacuum. the
statement of symmetry of the potential means that

symmetry

i =  i()  0 = v =  iiv

f or all i

where we allow nonlinear symmetries, and i = /i. dierentiating, and then
evaluating at this minimum,

hiv i = 0 at minimum  = hi

220

iv. mixed

 0 = hj( iiv )i = h(j i)(iv )i + h iijv i = h iihijv i

where here the vacuum value h i classically means to just evaluate at  = hi. (so
classically habi = haihbi.) spontaneous symmetry breaking means the vacuum
breaks the symmetry: if this symmetry is broken, then h ii 6= 0, so it is a nontrivial
eigenvector of hijv i (the mass matrix) with vanishing eigenvalue. so, we can write

where  is a massless eld.

i = hii + h ii + ...

the simplest example is a single free, massless eld, v = 0. then  is simply a
constant. the simplest choice of vacuum is just hi = 0, which breaks the symmetry:

l = 1

4 ()2,

 = constant,

hi = 0

then  is a goldstone boson.

the simplest nontrivial example, and a useful one, is a complex scalar with the

potential

v () = 1

42(||2  1

2m2)2

this is invariant under phase transformations  = i. there is a continuous set of

minima at || = m/2. we choose hi = m/2; then the goldstone theorem tells

us that the imaginary part of  is the goldstone eld. explicitly, separating the eld
into its real and imaginary parts,

 = 12

(m +  + i)  v = 1

42m22 + 1

42m(2 + 2) + 1

16 2(2 + 2)2

where hi = hi = 0. we could also use the nonlinear separation of the eld into
magnitude and phase,  = (m + )ei/2: then  drops out of the potential, and
its transformation ( is invariant) is the same as that of the free massless scalar. if
 had been real, then only the discete symmetry    would have been broken,
and there would be no goldstone boson.

exercise iva1.1

write the complete action in terms of  and .

note that this model would naively seem to have a tachyon (state with negative
(mass)2) if we had expanded about hi = 0. however, since the vacuum is dened
always as a minimum in the potential (or the energy), the true states always have
nonnegative (mass)2. this is the case for positive spins for similar reasons: we saw in
subsection iib4 that free massive theories follow from massless ones by dimensional
reduction from one extra spatial dimension. if we had used an extra time dimension

a. hidden symmetry

221

instead, as required for the wrong sign for the mass term in p2 + m2, there would
also be wrong signs for lorentz indices, resulting in kinetic terms with arbitrarily
negative energy.

spontaneous symmetry breaking will also eect the actions for elds other than
those getting vacuum values, that couple to them. for example, terms of the form
2f () will tend to generate a mass for  if hi 6= 0 (actually f (hi) 6= 0). such
couplings exist for  of spins 0, 1
2, 1. since masslessness is generally associated with
symmetry (chiral symmetry for spin 1
2 and gauge symmetry for spin 1), this type of
mass generation implies symmetries other than just those of the scalars are broken
by this mechanism (see subsections iva4-6).

2. sigma models

the goldstone mechanism thus produces massive particles as well as massless
ones, at least for polynomial potentials, to which we are restricted by quantum con-
siderations, to be discussed later. we now look for approximations to polynomial
scalar actions that eliminate the massive elds, but still take them into account
through their equations of motion, in the limit where their masses tend to innity.
for example, in the above simple model, we can take the limit   , which takes
the  mass (m) to innity. in this limit, the potential energy can remain nite only
if it vanishes: ||2 = 1
2m2. (in quantum language, the potentials contribution to the
path integral is just (r v ) in that limit. alternatively, we can neglect the kinetic

energy for || in comparison to the mass or potential, and then eliminate || through
its equation of motion in this approximation.) we can also enforce this limit directly
by using a lagrange multiplier eld :

l = 1

2||2 + (||2  1

2m2)

the solution to the constraint is  = m2
real scalar .

ei, and the action then describes just a free,

a less trivial example is a nonabelian generalization of this example: consider
 as a vector of an internal so(n) symmetry. (the previous example was the case
so(2).) the lagrangian is then

l = 1

4()2 + 1

2(2  m2)

the usual way to solve quadratic constraints without introducing square roots is to
use the identity

|(1 + ix)2|2 = (|1 + ix|2)2  (2x)2 + (1  x2)2 = (1 + x2)2

222

iv. mixed

this is often used for trigonometric substitutions or simplifying integrals. for exam-

ple, when an integrand has a 1  x2, substituting x = sin  eliminates the square

root at the price of requiring trigonometric identities, which in turn are usually solved
by making a second variable change to y = tan(/2). on the other hand, the above
identity suggests making instead the variable change x = 2y/(1 + y2), which actually
gives the same result, more directly, as the previous two-step method. (this identity
can also be used for nding integer solutions to the pythagorean theorem: a right
triangle with two shorter sides of integer lengths 2mn and m2n2 has the hypotenuse
m2 + n2, where m, n are integers.)

we then can solve the constraint 2 = m2 with the coordinates for the sphere in

terms of an so(n1) vector ,

 = m(cid:18)

then the kinetic term (now the whole action) becomes

()2

(1 + 1

42)2

exercise iva2.1

for so(3), express  in terms of the usual spherical polar angular coordinates
 and , along with the inverse expressions ( and  in terms of ).

another way to obtain this result is to use the solution of subsection ia6 to the

constraint

0 = y2 = (ya)2  2y+y  y = e(xa, 1, 1
(but now (ya)2 is positive denite). then the desired constraint

(ya)2 + (y1)2 = 1

follows from further constraining

1 = y0 = e 12

(1 + 1

2x2)  e =

2
1 + 1
2x2

 dy2 = e2dx2 =

yielding the above result for x = /2. we thus have a nonpolynomial action, each
term having derivatives. the original so(n) symmetry is nonlinearly realized on the
angle variables , and the vacuum (hi = 0) spontaneously breaks the symmetry

223

to so(n1). the constant m acts as a dimensionful coupling, as seen by scaling
  /m to give the kinetic term the standard normalization.

a complex generalization of this model is described by the lagrangian

l = 1

2||2 + (||2  m2)

where  is now a complex n-component vector,  is a u(1)-covariant derivative
( = ( + ia)), and  is a lagrange multiplier enforcing that  has magnitude
m. this model thus has a u(n) symmetry. since a has no kinetic term (f 2), we can
eliminate it by its algebraic eld equation:
8m2 ( 

 )2 + (||2  m2)

l  1

2||2 + 1

where we have applied the constraint ||2 = m2 (or shifted  to cancel terms propor-
tional to ||2  m2). since the u(1) gauge was not xed yet, we still have local u(1)
invariance even without an explicit gauge eld. we can use this invariance to x the
phase of one component of , and use the constraint from  to x its magnitude. in
terms of the remaining (n1)-component complex vector ,

4||2)2

(alternatively, we can solve the constraint and x the gauge rst, then eliminate
a by its eld equation.) this model is known as the cp(n1) model (complex
projective).

another example that will prove more relevant to physics is to generalize  to an

nn matrix: we then consider the lagrangian
2()  () + 1

l = tr[ 1

4 2(  1

2m2i)2]

(where i is the identity matrix). since  is hermitian and positive denite, the
minimum of the potential is at  = 1

2m2i, and we can choose

hi = m2

i

using the su(n)su(n)u(1) invariance

 = ulur1

224

iv. mixed

(we can include the u(1) in either ul or ur.) the vacuum then spontaneously breaks
this invariance to su(n):

hi = hi  ul = ur

in the large-mass limit, we get the constraint

 = 1

2m2i   = m2

u, uu = i,

hui = i, l  1

4m2tr[(u)(u)]

so the eld u itself is now unitary.

3. coset space

the appearance of the scalar elds (goldstone bosons) as group elements can
be generalized directly in terms of the eective theory, without reference to massive
elds. such a theory should be considered as a low-energy approximation to some
unknown theory. although the unknown theory may be better behaved at high
energies quantum mechanically (see later), the low-energy eective theory can be
determined from just (broken) symmetry. we therefore assume a symmetry group g
that is broken down to a subgroup h by the vacuum. (i.e., the vacuum is invariant
under the subgroup h, but not the full group g.) we are interested in only the
goldstone bosons, associated with all the generators of the group g less those of
h. these elds are thus coordinates for the coset space g/h: they correspond to
elements of the group g, but elements related by the subgroup h are identied.

explicitly, we rst write the eld g as an element of the group g, either by
choosing a matrix representation of the group (as in the u(n) example above), or
explicitly expanding over the group generators gi:

g = ei,

 = i(x)gi

we then factor out the subgroup h by introducing a gauge invariance for that
subgroup:

g = gh,

h = eih(x)h

in terms of the h generators h, which are a subset of gi:

gi = (h, ti)

where ti are the remaining generators, corresponding to g/h. in particular, we can
choose

gauge  = 0   = iti

a. hidden symmetry

225

however, g should still be a global invariance of the theory, though not of the vacuum.
we therefore assume the global transformation

g = g0g

where g0 is an element of the full group g, but is constant in x. the vacuum

hgi = i

is then invariant under the global subgroup g0 = h1, where thus h is constant and
g0 h (i.e., g is spontaneously broken to h).

g can be used to convert any representation of the global group g into one (but

usually reducible) of the smaller local group h:

 = g0    g1,

 = h1 

we can apply a similar procedure to nd a eld strength for g, invariant under the
global group, as an element of the lie algebra of g:

g1ag = a + ia

ah + if i

ati = a + if i
ati

this can be evaluated in the  parametrization as multiple commutators, as usual: a
and f are both nonpolynomial functions of , but with only one derivative. we have
absorbed a into a covariant derivative  because of the remaining transformation
law under the local group h:

( + if ) = h1( + if )h   = h1h, f  = h1f h

where we have assumed [h, ti]  tj. (in particular, this is true for compact groups,
where the structure constants are totally antisymmetric: then fi = 0  fi = 0.)
then the action invariant under global and local transformations can be chosen as

l = 1

4m2tr(f 2)

for example, the real vector model we gave in the previous subsection describes the
coset space so(n)/so(n1), the complex vector describes su(n)/u(n1), and the
matrix model describes u(n)u(n)/u(n).

b for the case of u(n)u(n)/u(n), the direct product means we use separate

group-element elds for the two global groups, with

gl = gl0glh,

gr = gr0grh

for the same h. find an expression for the eld u of the previous subsection
without breaking any global or local symmetries.

note that the eld redenition between the g-representation matter eld  and
the h-representation matter eld  modies the form of the couplings. for example,
the kinetic term for  will have ordinary partial derivatives , while that for  will
have covariant ones . (one or the other will also have f terms.) on the other
hand, a mass term for  may turn into a potential/yukawa term for , since the
larger group g might not allow mass terms permitted by the smaller group h. the
result is that what appears as a nonderivative coupling in terms of  may appear as
a derivative coupling in terms of .

we can formulate general spontaneous breakdown in this language:

(1) start with a polynomial action with symmetry g, including scalars  that will

suer the breakdown through expectation, and other elds .

(2) introduce an appropriate g and dene the new scalar elds   g1, as well as
the new matter elds   g1. thus s[, ]  s[ , , g]. in terms of these
new elds, the action has a local symmetry h, and g now acts only on g.

(3) (h-covariantly) constrain  in such a way that g eectively replaces the missing
parts. then g describes all the goldstone bosons, while the reduced  describes
the other scalars in the original  (in the previous examples, the massive ones,
which decoupled at low energies).

for example, for the so(n) model,  is an n-vector, while g parametrizes the coset
so(n)/so(n1), and thus has n(n1)/2  (n1)(n2)/2 = n1 non-gauge compo-
nents  it is an n1-vector under h. thus for , which is nn11 under h, we
just constrain the n1 part to vanish.

we have described how nonpolynomial actions quadratic in derivatives can arise
as a low-energy approximation to polynomial theories. further nonpolynomial terms
quartic in derivatives (but no more than quadratic in time derivatives) can be useful
for certain applications, but these arise from polynomial actions quadratic in deriva-
tives (which are preferred for quantum reasons) only by quantum eects. one use is
in models which describe (pseudo)scalar mesons by fundamental elds (i.e., solutions
to the free eld equations, which yield interacting solutions through perturbation the-
ory), but baryons by nonperturbative solutions to the eld equations of these scalars.

a. hidden symmetry

227

such an interpretation is suggested by an expansion in 1/n, where n is the number

of colors, since a baryon is made of n quarks (whereas a meson contains just one

quark and one antiquark). such models are useful for describing static properties
of baryons (masses, quantum numbers), but the complexity of such solutions to the

eld equations prevents their use for interactions of baryons (especially with other

baryons).

4. chiral symmetry

later well examine a description of the strongly interacting particles (hadrons)

in which they are all considered as composites (bound states) of fermionic quarks.

however, this theory is extremely dicult to solve, so we rst consider treating the

hadrons as fundamental instead. since there are probably an innite number of kinds
of hadrons (or at least some integer power of 1040, considering the (planck mass)2),
this would require a formulation in terms of a string that treated all mesons

(bosonic hadrons) as a single entity. that possibility also will be considered later;

for now, we look at the simpler possibility of studying just the low-energy physics of
hadrons by using elds for just the lightest particles.

so far, the only observed scalar particles have been strongly interacting ones.

some of the scalar mesons, especially the pions, are not only the lightest hadrons,

but can be considered close to massless on the hadronic scale. we therefore look for
a description of pions (and some close relatives) in the massless approximation; then

mass-generating corrections can be considered.

normally, quantum corrections can aect masses. the only way to guarantee

masslessness at the quantum level is through some symmetry; we then can study this
symmetry already at the classical level. we have seen that (unbroken) gauge invari-

ance can require masslessness for all elds except the scalar and spinor. masslessness

for a spinor can be enforced by chiral symmetry: if there is a u(1) symmetry for
all irreducible spinors , then no mass terms (bilinears 
1 2) can be constructed.
(generally, each spinor can have dierent u(1) charges, as long as no two charges

add to zero. of course, this u(1) can be a subgroup of a larger chiral symmetry

group.) the only way a scalar can be guaranteed masslessness is if it is a gold-

stone boson. we therefore look for a description of pions as goldstone bosons of
some spontaneously broken symmetry. (supersymmetry is another possibility to en-

force massless scalars, but only if there are also massless fermions, which is not the

case for hadrons.) furthermore, pions and the other lightest scalars are actually

228

iv. mixed

pseudoscalars: this suggests that they are the goldstone bosons of broken chiral
symmetry, which simultaneously generates masses for the fermions.

for simplicity, we consider the coupling of scalar mesons to quarks. we could
instead couple mesons to baryons (fermionic hadrons), thus treating only hadrons,
but the principles would be the same, only the indices would be messier. combining
c invariance with chiral symmetry, and including a meson potential for spontaneous
symmetry breaking, we can write the action for just the quarks and scalar mesons as

l = [q

li .ql + qt 

r i

s =z dx tr l
.q*r .] + [ 1
lqt

r + q*

+[q

2()  () + 1

42(  1

2 m2i)2]

.
rql .]

where  is an mm matrix (m avors), ql and qr are nm matrices (n colors),
and  is the yukawa coupling. sometimes it will be convenient to drop lorentz
indices to emphasize internal symmetries:

l = (qliql + qt

riq*r) + [ 1

2()  () + 1

42( 1

2m2i)2] + (qlqt

r + qr*ql)

besides color symmetry (local if we had bothered to write in the yang-mills elds for
the gluons, by    on the quarks), we have the (global) u(m)lu(m)r chiral
(avor) symmetry

ql = qlul,

qr = qrur*,  = u1

l ur

including the (global) u(1) baryon number symmetry

ul = ur = ei  ql = eiql,

qr = eiqr,  = 

if we think of baryon number as an so(2) symmetry, then charge conjugation is

just the reection that completes this to an o(2) symmetry (see exercise iia1.2):

c :

ql  qr,   t

229

(where for cp and p we also transform the coordinates as usual).

as before, the vacuum hi = m2

i breaks the avor symmetry to the diagonal
subgroup ul = ur, which commutes with parity (and is therefore no longer chiral).
it also gives masses to the quarks (since chiral symmetry is broken); this is a general
feature of spinors coupled to scalars under spontaneous breakdown.
in the limit
   (where the mass of all bosons but the goldstones becomes innite, but the
quark mass m = m is xed), the goldstone bosons are described by the unitary
matrix u, which transforms as u = u1

l uur.

exercise iva4.1

rewrite this action according to the analysis of exercise iva3.1b:

a separate the goldstone bosons from the massive scalars.

b replace the g-representation quarks with the h-representation quarks.

an interesting special case is m=1 (one avor). the goldstone boson of axial
u(1) can be identied with the 0. in the limit   , the lagrangian becomes
(with a tr no longer needed)

l = (q

.
li .ql + qt 

r i

.q*r .) + 1

4 m2()2 + m2

(eiqt 

r ql + eiq

lq*r .)

writing  for the neutral pion eld.  = m/m is still the coupling of the pion to
the quarks, as can be seen by rescaling   /m to give the kinetic term the usual
normalization. (the coupling m is known as the pion decay constant, and is usually
denoted f. if we include leptons with the quarks, then this coupling also describes
the decay of the pion into two leptonic fermions.)

in this case, the (broken) axial u(1) transformations are

ql = eiql,

qr = eiqr,

 =   2

the corresponding axial current (determined, e.g., by coupling a gauge vector) is

.

this current is still conserved, since the eld equations arent changed by the prop-
erties of the vacuum. the linear term is characteristic of expanding the goldstone
eld about the spontaneously broken vacuum; it corresponds to the fact that that
eld has an inhomogeneous transformation under the broken symmetry.

however, in reality the pion is not exactly massless, so we should add to the
previous action a mass term for the pion, which explicitly violates the symmetry. (it
is then a pseudogoldstone boson.) in the general chiral symmetry model, where the

230

iv. mixed

goldstone bosons are described by a unitary matrix, a simple term that gives them
masses while preserving the polar (parity-preserving) diagonal symmetry ul = ur of
the vacuum is, for some constant ,

lm =  tr( +  

2mi)

since this explicitly breaks the axial u(m) symmetries, the corresponding currents
are no longer conserved. in the u(1) case, we can also add just a mass term

lm = 1

42,

 = m2m2


(for some constant ), which is the leading contribution from the general term above.
the change in the eld equation for  now violates the conservation law as

  ja = 

this explicitly broken conservation law is known as partially conserved axial cur-
rent (pcac).

5. stuckelberg

by denition, only gauge-invariant variables are observable. although in general
a change of variables to gauge-invariant ones can be complicated and impractical,
there are certain theories where such a procedure can be implemented very simply
as part of the normal gauge-xing. not surprisingly, the only nonlinearity in these
redenitions involves scalars.

the simplest cases of such redenitions are free theories, and are thus contained
in our earlier discussion of general free, massive gauge theories. the simplest of these
is the massive vector. as described in subsection iib4, the lagrangian and gauge
invariance are

l = 1

8f 2 + 1
a = ,

4(ma + )2

 = m

where fab is the abelian eld strength. note that the scalar is pure gauge: it is
called a compensator for this gauge invariance. since it has a nonderivative gauge
transformation, it can easily be gauged to zero at each point, by just choosing  =
/m. this means that without loss of generality we can consider the theory in
terms of just the gauge-invariant eld

a = a + 1

m

a. hidden symmetry

231

this composite eld can also be considered as a eld redention or gauge transfor-
mation on a. the lagrangian simplies to

l = 1

8f 2 + 1

4m2a2

later well see that it is often more useful to keep  as an independent eld.

exercise iva5.1

choose the gauge a0 = . show that  then can be eliminated by its equa-
leaving only the transverse 3-vector ai, with lagrangian
tion of motion,
 1
4 ai(  m2)ai. show the relation to the lightcone gauge of subsection
iiic2, using the dimensional reduction langauge of subsection iib4.

the original lagrangian can also be considered an unusual coupling of a massless
vector to a massless scalar: remember that the massless scalar is the simplest example
of a goldstone boson, with the spontaneously broken global symmetry

 = t ,

t  = 1

where we have dened the symmetry generator t to act inhomogeneously on . we
then couple the photon to this charge: after a trivial rescaling of the gauge eld,

l = 1

8m2 f 2 + 1

4 ()2,

 =  + at

where m is the charge with which a couples to , which in this case happens to
have dimensions of mass. the electromagnetic current in this case is simply j = 1
2,
whose conservation is the scalar eld equation  = 0 (with gauge-covariantized
).

because the spontaneously broken symmetry of the corresponding goldstone
model is now gauged, expanding about hi = 0 is no longer a physical statement
about the vacuum, since  is no longer gauge invariant. (as we saw, we can even
choose  = 0 as a gauge condition.) therefore, from now on, when we make a
statement such as hi = 0 in such a case, it will be understood to refer to choos-
ing  = 0 as the value about which to perform perturbation expansions (e.g., for
separating actions into kinetic terms and interactions).

note that the stuckelberg action can be generated starting from the action with

just a, and performing a gauge transformation that is not an invariance:

a  a + 1

m 

dropping the prime from a, this transformation is just the inverse of the one we used
to eliminate the scalar. if we start from an action that has also a coupling of a to
matter, we see that conserved currents decouple from :

z a  j z a  j  1

mz   j

232

iv. mixed

more precisely, if the only term in the action for vector + matter that is not gauge
invariant is the vector mass term ( 1
4m2a2), then the above gauge transformation
aects only that term.

6. higgs

we have seen that spontaneous symmetry breakdown can generate masses for
spinors. we also saw how a massless vector could become massive by eating a
would-be goldstone scalar, in the simplest case of a scalar without self-interactions.
well now examine more interesting models: yang-mills theories, which describe self-
interacting vectors, must couple to self-interacting scalars to become massive.

we can expect, by considering the linearization of any yang-mills theory coupled
to scalars, that we will need more scalars than massive vectors, since each vector needs
to eat a scalar to become massive, and some scalars will become massive and thus
uneaten. (only would-be goldstone bosons can be eaten, as seen by linearization to
the stuckelberg model.) for the simple (and most useful) example of u(n) for the
gauge group, an obvious choice for the scalar higgs eld is an nn matrix. (su(n)
can be treated as a slight modication.) the simplest such model is the one studied
in subsection iva2: we now consider one of the su(n) symmetries (together with
the u(1)) as the local color symmetry to which the yang-mills elds couple, and
the other su(n) as the global avor symmetry (where we use the names color
and avor to distinguish local and global symmetries, not necessarily related to
chromodynamics).

the lagrangian for this gervais-neveu model is then
42(  1

2 ()  () + 1

8g2 f 2 + 1

l = tr[ 1

2m2i)2]

where  =  + ia, and aa and  are nn matrices (but aa are hermitian). now 
is gauge invariant (although not invariant under the avor group), so we still have

hi = 1
as a gauge-invariant statement (but hi = m2
i, or hi = 1
only for purposes of gauge-dependent perturbation expansions).

2 m2i

2m2i, still makes sense

since any complex matrix can be written as  = uh/2, where u is unitary and
h is hermitian, we can choose the unitary gauge u = i (i.e.,  = ). as for the
stuckelberg case, this is equivalent to working in terms of the gauge-invariant elds
(dened by using this u as a gauge transformation)
a = u1(i + a)u,  = 12

h = u1

a. hidden symmetry

233

where u can be dened by

12

h =p, u = 2h1

this is well-dened as long as h is invertible, which is true for small perturbations

about its vacuum value

hhi = mi

if the perturbation is so large that h has vanishing eigenvalues, then this is equivalent

to looking at states so far away from the vacuum that some of the broken symmetry
is restored. expanding about the vacuum (h  mi + h), the lagrangian is now

l = tr[ 1

8g2 f 2 + 1

4m2a2 + 1

4(h)2 + 1

42m2h 2

+a  1

4(hi


 h) + 1

2ma2h + 1

42mh 3 + 1

4a2h 2 + 1

162h 4]

thus all particles are now massive. as for the goldstone case, we can take the limit
   to get rid of all the massive scalars, which in this case leaves just the massive
vectors, adding only the mass term to the original yang-mills action. this was clear

from the nonlinear  model that resulted from that limit, by coupling that eld (u)

to yang-mills directly.

exercise iva6.1

find the chiral action for this model of the type described in subsection iiic4,

where the massive vectors are described by self-dual tensors instead of vectors.

exercise iva6.2

consider again this model, for the case n=2. we modify this example by

dropping the u(1) gauge eld, so we have just su(2). since su(2) is pseu-

doreal, we can further restrict the higgs eld to satisfy the reality condition

* = cc. thus, both color and avor groups are su(2), and  is the usual
matrix representation of the 4-vector of so(4)=su(2)su(2) (see subsection
iia5). repeat the analysis given above.

exercise iva6.3

consider again the gauge group su(2), but now take the higgs eld in the

adjoint representation, with no avor group (i.e., a real 3-vector). show that

only 2 of the 3 vectors get mass, leaving a residual u(1) gauge invariance.

explain this in terms of the gauge transformations of the 3-vector. (hint:

think 3d rotations.)

in this section we discuss the standard model, the minimal theory that de-

scribes all the observed particles and forces (except gravity). we also consider some

features of grand unied theories (guts), an extension of the standard model

that uses fewer multiplets.

1. chromodynamics

one way in which particles naively described by the action can be hidden from

observation is if the force binding them is too strong to allow them to exist freely.

such a condition is often called infrared slavery since this alleged property of the

force is a long-range feature, preventing the constituent particles from escaping to

innity. this connement is not a classical phenomenon, and its occurence even

at the quantum level has not yet been proven. therefore, in this section well simply

assume connement, and describe the resultant symmetry properties, leaving the

dynamical properties for later chapters.

the assumption of color connement is that the color forces are so strong that

they bind any objects of color to other such objects; thus, only colorless states, those

that are singlets under the color gauge group, can exist freely. composite elds that

are invariant under the local group transformations can be obtained by multiplying

matter elds or yang-mills eld strengths, perhaps using also covariant derivatives,

and contracting all color indices. the color gauge group is generally assumed to be

su(n): usually su(3), but sometimes larger n for purposes of perturbation in 1/n.

larger n is also used for unication, but in that case the higgs mechanism is used to

reduce the group of the massless vectors to su(3) (times abelian factors).

another feature of these conned states, to be considered later, is their geomet-

rical structure. the observed spectrum and scattering amplitudes of the hadrons

(strongly interacting particles) indicates a stringlike identication of at least the ex-

cited states. (the ground states may behave more like bags.) this picture also

ts in with connement, since the spatial separation of the quarks and antiquarks in

excited states would force the gluons that convey their interactions (and self-interact)

to conne themselves as much as possible by collapsing into strings connecting the

quarks. thus, we describe a meson with an open string, with a quark at one end

and an antiquark at the other. similarly, an excited glueball would no longer be a

ball, but rather a closed string, forming a closed loop.

236

iv. mixed

we will need to reconsider also the discrete symmetries, c, p, and t, and their

combinations. first of all, we note the cpt theorem: all local, hermitian, poincare

invariant actions are cpt invariant. this is easy to see from the fact that cpt only

changes the overall sign of the coordinates, which is eectively the same as changing
the sign of each derivative, as well as giving a 1 for each vector index on a eld. since
cpt also gives signs to dotted spinors and not undotted ones, we also get 1s for
.; signs cancel when contracting spinor
vector combinations of indices on spinors ( 
indices on pairs of dotted or undotted spinors). thus, all these signs cancel because

poincare invariance requires an even number of vector indices (in even numbers of
dimensions, from contracting with ab and abcd). alternatively, and even more simply,
in d=4 we can attribute it to having even numbers both of undotted spinor indices

and of dotted spinor indices, since we can dene cpt by associating a sign with each

dotted index (including those that appear as part of a vector index). consequently,

from now on we ignore t and consider only c, p, and cp.

although we have considered c (and thus cp) in the context of electromagnetism,

nonabelian gauge elds require some (simple) generalization, since they carry charge

themselves. we start with the general coupling of massless fermions to nonabelian

gauge elds:

l = 

.
(i

.
 + a

.
)

where  is a column vector with respect to the gauge group, and a a hermitian

matrix. the cp transformation of the fermions then determines that of the vectors,

needed for invariance:

cp :

 = * .,

*

. = ,




.


=  .,

= at  .

a


.


(remember ()*  
have chosen to represent parity on the coordinates as acting on the explicit  rather

., but ()* =   . because of the factor of c), where we

than on the arguments of the elds. the transformation on the vector is thus parity
on the vector index, combined with charge conjugation aa = at
a = aa*: the
minus sign can be associated with change in sign of the coupling (as for the abelian

case), while the complex conjugation takes into account the charge of the vector
elds themselves. (as discussed in subsection ib2, g  g* is an invariance of the
algebra, where g  g* and g = eig.) although these terms, as well as the f 2 term
for the vectors, are cp invariant, this invariance can be broken by coupling to scalars:

the yukawa coupling

ly = t  + h.c.

b. standard model

237

for some matrix  of scalars, would require the cp transformation

 = *

(up to perhaps some unitary transformation), but unlike the vectors there is no guar-
antee that under complex conjugation the matrix  = imi for real scalars i and
constant matrix (yukawa couplings) mi will preserve this form, i.e., satisfy

imi = imi*

since the matrices mi can be complex.

the basic assumption of chromodynamics, or in the quantized version quan-

tum chromodynamics (qcd), is that we have a nonabelian gauge theory without

fundamental scalars that couple directly (but scalars will show up when we intro-

duce electroweak interactions). namely, we assume only yang-mills for the color

gauge group su(n), specically n=3, with the usual action, minimally coupled to

spin-1/2 quarks in the dening representation of the color group, which may have

masses. (these masses are actually generated by weakly interacting higgs bosons,

whose coupling we consider in the next subsection; for now we include just the re-

sulting mass terms.) such an action is automatically invariant under cp and t.

we furthermore assume invariance under charge conjugation: just as an irreducible

real scalar describes particles that are their own antiparticles, and needs doubling (or

complexication) to dene charge, an irreducible (massive) spinor cannot describe

distinguishable particle and antiparticle. but the quarks come in the dening rep-

resentation of su(n), which is complex, and thus requires doubling to dene mass
terms. therefore, for every quark eld ql (l for left) we have an antiquark
eld qr (r for right), and they transform into each other under charge conjuga-
tion, just as a scalar transforms into its complex conjugate. (a spinor cant transform

into its complex conjugate under c, since c commutes with spacetime symmetries,

like lorentz transformations.) besides this doubling, and the n colors of the quarks,

we also assume a further multiplicity of m dierent avors of quarks. gauge invari-

ance requires the quark masses be independent of color, and c invariance requires the
mass terms couple ql to qr, but these terms violate an otherwise global u(m)u(m)
avor symmetry.

the action is then of the form

tr[ 1

8f 2 + (qliql + qriqr) + ( m2

qt
rql + h.c.)]

238

iv. mixed

where we have written ql and qr as matrices with respect to su(n) color (uc) and
u(m)u(m) avor (uf l and uf r) such that they transform as

ql = ucqluf l,

qr = uc*qruf r*

and thus the covariant derivatives can be written as

aql = (a + iaa)ql,

aqr = (a  iaa*)qr

where aa are hermitian, traceless, nn matrices. (by denition, charge conjugation
takes a representation of an internal symmetry into the complex-conjugate one.)

while the color symmetry is a local symmetry, the avor symmetry is broken,

inducing the transformation on the mass matrix

m = uf lmu1
f r

this transformation allows the mass matrix m to be chosen real and diagonal: any
matrix can be written as a hermitian one times a unitary one. a uf r transformation,
as a eld redenition, then can be made to cancel the unitary factor in m; then
a unitary transformation uf l = uf r can be made to diagonalize m (while keeping
it hermitian). these diagonal elements are then simply the masses of the m dif-
ferent quark avors. the most symmetric case is m = 0, which leaves the entire
u(m)u(m) chiral symmetry unbroken. (see subsection iva4.) the least symmet-
ric case is where all the masses are nonzero and unequal, leaving as unbroken only
the subgroup u(1)m, with uf l = uf r.
(in general, uf l = uf r if all masses are
nonvanishing.)

exercise ivb1.1

show the most general case is the product of u(n)s for various subspaces,
with 2 u(n)s for the massless subspace.

since the above transformation allows m to be diagonalized, in particular it can

be made symmetric, which is sucient to dene charge conjugation:

c :

ql  qr,

aa  aa*

furthermore, since m can be chosen not only symmetric but real, in particular it can
be made hermitian, which is enough to dene parity:

p :

l,r  qr,l .,
q

aa  aa

the minimal form of this action, besides making cp and t automatic, also au-
tomatically extends the discrete symmetry c to an o(2) symmetry, whose parity

b. standard model

239

transformation is c and whose continuous so(2)=u(1) symmetry is the u(1) part
of the u(m) avor symmetry, which is not broken by the mass term. it corresponds
to a charge called baryon number: up to an overall normalization factor, it simply
counts the number of quarks ql, qr . (which form a dirac spinor) minus the number
of antiquarks qr, ql .. however, such an o(2) symmetry can be dened separately
for each avor, since (after m has been diagonalized) the action can be written as
a sum of independent terms for each avor. in particular, each avor has its own
separately conserved quark number. these avor conservation laws, at the classical
level, are broken only by the weak interactions, which we have not included in the
above action. (gravity and electromagnetism do not violate them.)

since connement is a quantum eect, the details of hadronic scattering cannot be
discussed within classical eld theory. however, we saw that low-energy properties of
mesons (and similarly for baryons) could be described by eective lagrangians. the
fact that hadrons are made of quarks can be used to obtain a bit more information
even at the classical level, especially if the relevant quarks are heavy. (heavy with
respect to what is unfortunately also a question that can be answered only at the
quantum level.) for example, in a nonrelativistic approximation, low-energy proper-
ties of hadrons can be found from just the quantum numbers, spin-spin interactions,
and masses of the quarks, while their velocities are ignored, and the gluons are ne-
glected altogether.
in such an approximation, reasonably accurate predictions are
made for the masses and magnetic moments of the ground-state hadrons.

actually, the claim that color nonsinglet states can never be observed needs a
bit of stipulation: there may be a quark-gluon plasma phase of hadronic matter
that can exist only at extremely high temperatures or pressures. thus, a hypothet-
ical observer during the rst moments of the universe might observe free quarks
and gluons. similarly, a small enough observer, living inside an individual hadron,
might see individual quarks and gluons, since the size of his equipment would be
much smaller than what we consider asymptotic distances. conversely, we could
consider the possibility of a new chromodynamic force, other than the one respon-
sible for the hadrons of which we are composed, that has a connement scale that
is astronomical (extremely low energy), so that earthly laboratories would t inside
the new hadrons. thus, any statement about the observability of color must be a
dynamical one, and does not follow as an automatic consequence of the appearance of
a nonabelian group: just as for the higgs eect, connement can be repealed under
appropriate circumstances, and the observability of color depends on the details of
the dynamics, and in particular on the values of the various parameters (momenta
and couplings).

2. electroweak

the weak and electromagnetic interactions are mediated by observed spin-1 par-
ticles, some of which have charge and mass. specically (see subsection ic4), the
massive vectors form a triplet (w +, w , z), while there is only one massless vector
(the photon). this suggests a gauge group of su(2)u(1), with a higgs eect that
leaves only u(1) unbroken. from the table of known fundamental fermions, we can see
that they fall into doublets and singlets of this su(2), with the u(1) charge being that
of electromagnetism. (this su(2)u(1) unication of the weak and electromagnetic
interactions is called the glashow-salam-weinberg model.)

we saw in subsection iva4 a very simple model of spontaneously broken chiral
u(m)u(m) symmetry where masses were generated for quarks. in subsection iva6
we saw how the same scalars could generate masses for vectors, by coupling to one
of the u(m)s. we now combine those two models, specializing to the case m=2,
but with two slight modications: (1) since the dening representation of su(2) is
2, 1
pseudoreal, we can impose a reality condition on the higgs eld, which is in the ( 1
2)
representation of su(2)su(2):

* = cc

this makes it a vector of so(4)=su(2)su(2) (see exercises iia5.3 and iva6.2.)
its also the reality condition satised by an element of (the dening representation
of) su(2). (see subsection iia2.) this is not surprising, since the group product
u = uluur allows the interpretation of a group element itself as a representation
of chiral symmetry. this is the situation described in subsection iva2 (  u in the
large-mass limit), but in this case  is automatically proportional to the identity
(it gives the square of the 4-vector), so in general an so(4) 4-vector can be written
as the product of a scalar with an su(2) element. this reality condition breaks the
chiral u(1)u(1) to the diagonal u(1) that leaves the higgs invariant.

(2) the gauged su(2) is still one of the two chiral su(2)s, but the gauged u(1)

must now be a subgroup of the other su(2), since the higgs is now invariant under
the usual u(1)s. thus, the ungauged su(2) is explictly broken, and this accounts
for the mass splittings in the doublets of known fundamental fermions. remember
that observables are singlets of gauged nonabelian groups (except perhaps for abelian
subgroups), so any observed internal su(2) must be a global symmetry, even when

its broken. as described in subsection iva6, these singlets can be constructed as
composite elds resulting from the gauge transformation obtained from the su(2)
part of .

b. standard model

using the electromagnetic charges of the various particles, we thus determine
their su(2)u(1) representations: for spin 1, we have w =(1,0) and v =(0,0), where
the rst entry is the isospin and the second is the u(1) charge. for spin 0, we
have =( 1
2 ), choosing the u(1) generator as the diagonal one from ur. finally,
for spin 1/2, we have for the leptons ll=( 1
2 ), which combines with  to pro-
duce (0,0)(0,1), and lr=(0,1). similarly, for the quarks we have ql=( 1
6), and
qr=(0, 1
2). (we use for undotted spinors the convention l = fermion, r =
antifermion.) the lagrangian is then

(the innitesimal gauge transformations have the same form, dropping the deriva-
tive term and replacing the gauge eld with the corresponding gauge parameter.)
for simplicity we have ignored the indices for color (and its gauge elds, treated in
the previous section), families (treated in the following subsection), and spin. we
have also used matrix notation with respect to the local su(2) (gauged by w ) and
the global su(2) (explicitly broken in l1/2 by the gauging of a u(1) subgroup, the
yukawa couplings, and the chirality of the massless neutrinos): thus w is a traceless
hermitian 22 matrix,  is also 22 but satisfying the reality condition given above
(traceless antihermitian plus real trace), ql, qr, and ll are 2-component rows, and
lr is a single component. (by denition, the diagonal parts of w and  are electro-
magnetically neutral.) the quark yukawa coupling is diagonal in the broken su(2)
to preserve the local u(1) symmetry. (the tr here is trivial for the lepton yukawa

we then can expand  about its vacuum value m: the lowest order terms give masses
for most of the vectors and fermions: the massless fermions are the neutrinos, while
the massless vector gauging the unbroken u(1) (a combination of the original u(1)
with a u(1) subgroup of the su(2)) is the photon (of electromagnetic fame). the
mass of the remaining vectors accounts for the weakness and short range of the weak
interactions.

note that, unlike the strong (chromodynamic) or purely electromagnetic (or even
gravitational) interactions, the weak interactions break every discrete spacetime sym-
metry possible.
(the others break none. cp violation will be discussed in the
following subsection. of course, cpt is always preserved.) sometimes this is at-
tributed to the presence of a chiral symmetry, used to reduce 4-component spinors to
2-component; however, we have already seen that in general chiral and parity symme-
tries are unrelated. (you can have either without the other. this fact will be further
discussed in subsections ivb4 and viiib3.) a better explanation is to attribute
p and c to doubling, which converts spinors from 2-component to 4-component:
2-component spinors are the simplest description of helicity/spin 1
2; 4-component
spinors are useful only to manifest a larger symmetry, when it exists. the weak inter-
actions violate parity because the neutrino is not doubled, and because the fermions
that are doubled no longer have a symmetry relating their two halves.

3. families

in the standard model (and its simpler generalizations) there is no explanation
for the existence of more than one family of fermions. however, the existence of 3
families does have interesting consequences. most of these follow from the form of the
yukawa couplings, and thus the fermion masses. in subsection ivb1 we considered
redenitions of the fermion elds as unitary avor transformations. these allowed us
to obtain the simplest form of the mass matrices, since they were not avor singlets,
and thus transformed. we now perform similar transformations, but only on the
family indices, since transformations that dont commute with the gauge symmetries
would complicate the other terms in the action. now ignoring spin, color, and local
avor indices, and using matrix notation for the family indices, the fermions transform
as

ql = qluql,

qr

= qruqr*,

ll = llull,

lr = lrulr*

where ql, qr, ll, and lr have m components for the m families. qr are the 2
components of the (explicitly broken) global avor doublet qr. we thus have 5 u(m)

244

iv. mixed

symmetries, all broken by the yukawa couplings: these eld redenitions induce

transformations on them,




= uqlu1
qr

,

 = ullu1
lr

as in subsection ivb1, uqr and ulr can be used to make  and  hermitian.
then ull can be used to make  diagonal, also as in subsection ivb1, leaving a u(1)m
symmetry ull = ulr, corresponding to separate conservation laws for electron number
(including its neutrino), muon number, and tauon number for the 3 known avors.
however, the quark sector works a bit dierently: we can use uql to diagonalize +
or , but not both. this leaves another u(1)m symmetry uql = uqr+ = uqr. if +
has been diagonalized, then 1 of the m u(1)s, corresponding to total quark number
(baryon number) conservation, leaves  invariant, while the remaining m1 u(1)s
can be used to eliminate some of the phases of the complex o-diagonal components
of .

the remaining global avor symmetries are thus m lepton u(1)s and 1 quark

u(1). the remaining yukawa couplings are the real, diagonal , describing the m

masses of the massive leptons (the neutrinos remain massless), the real, diagonal
+, giving the m masses of half of the quarks, and the hermitian , consisting
of m diagonal components, describing the masses of the other quarks, m(m1)/2
magnitudes of the o-diagonal components, and (m1)(m2)/2 phases of the o-
diagonal components. these phases violate cp invariance: cp, besides its aect on

the coordinates, switches each spinor eld with its complex conjugate. since the

complex conjugate term in the action uses the complex conjugates of the s, this

symmetry is violated whenever any of the components have imaginary parts (after

taking into account all possible symmetries that could compensate for this, as we

have just done). note that cp is violated only for 3 families or more. (c and p
are separately violated for any number of families by the su(2)u(1) coupling: as
discussed in subsection ivb1, c invariance of the strong interactions is the symmetry
ql  qr.) since we can choose to transform away the phases in the subsector of the
2 lighter quark families, the large masses of the heavier quarks suppress this eect,

accounting for the smallness of cp violation.

since observed particles are mass eigenstates, its convenient to perform a further

unitary transformation (the cabibbo-kobayashi-maskawa matrix) that diagonal-

izes the mass matrix. although this is clearly possible by the arguments of subsec-

tion ivb1, it is not part of the unitary transformations considered in this subsection

b. standard model

245

because it does not commute with the su(2) gauge symmetry: after such a trans-
formation, we nd that the components of each su(2) quark multiplet are linear
superpositions of dierent families.

exercise ivb3.1

perform this diagonalization explicitly for the case m=2 (two families), using
the two lightest families of quarks and leptons as listed in subsection ic4.
which particles mix? parametrize this mixing by an angle c (the cabibbo
angle).

an important experimental result with which the standard model is consistent is
the suppression of avor-changing neutral currents (fcnc). the two electrically
neutral gauge elds in this model, the z and the photon , couple to currents that are
neutral with respect to the u(1) symmetries associated with each of the quark (avor)
numbers. this is true by construction before the unitary ckm transformation, but
this transformation also leaves these two currents invariant (the glashow-iliopoulos-
maiani mechanism). thus, at the classical level we do not see eects such as the
decay k 0  z  +, which would violate this conservation law. furthermore,
the quantum corrections are suppressed (though nonvanishing) for similar reasons:
for example, the lowest-order nonvanishing quantum correction comes from replacing
the z with a w +w  pair. without the ckm matrix, this contribution would vanish;
treating ckm, and its resulting contribution to quark masses, as a perturbtation, the
resulting contribution is suppressed by a factor of m2
w . the absence of fcnc is
an important constraint on generalizations of the standard model.

4. grand unied theories

the standard model gives a description of the weak and electromagnetic inter-
actions that describes the spin-1 particles in terms of gauge elds, and accounts for
all masses by the higgs eect. however, it does not give any unication, in the sense
that we still have 3 groups (su(3), su(2), and u(1)) for 3 interactions (strong, weak,
and electromagnetic), and a large variety of spin-1/2 elds that are unrelated ex-
cept by color and broken su(2) avor. grand unied theories unify this symmetry
by forcing all 3 gauge groups to be subgroups of a simple group, which is broken to
su(3)su(2)u(1) by higgs (and then broken to su(3)u(1) by more higgs). this
means introducing new spin-1 particles that are unobserved so far because of their
very large masses. on the other hand, the known fermions are then grouped together
in a small number of multiplets without introducing new fermions (except perhaps
partners for the neutrinos to allow them to have small masses). unfortunately, this

246

iv. mixed

requires a more complicated (and ambiguous) higgs sector, with separate spin-0 mul-
tiplets and couplings for rst breaking to su(3)su(2)u(1) and then breaking to
su(3)u(1); we wont discuss those higgs elds here.

the simplest such model uses the group su(5). recall the su(3)su(2)u(1)

representations of each family of fermions:

ql = (3, 1

2, 1

6),

qr+ = (3, 0, 1

3 ),

qr = (3, 0, 2
3),

ll = (1, 1

2 , 1
2),

lr = (1, 0, 1)

where the rst argument is the dimension of the su(3) representation (3 being the
complex conjugate of the 3), the second is the su(2) isospin, and the third is the u(1)
charge. an su(3)su(2)u(1) subgroup of su(5) can be found easily by taking
the 5-component dening representation and picking 3 components as the dening
representation of su(3) and the other 2 for that of su(2): i.e., consider a traceless
hermitian 55 matrix as an element of the su(5) lie algebra, and take

( su(5) ) (cid:18) su(3)  1

3 i  u(1)
0

0
su(2) + 1

2 i  u(1)(cid:19)

or in other words

5  (3, 0, 1

3)  (1, 1

2, 1
2)

from this we recognize the fermions as falling into a 5  10, where the 10 is the
antisymmetric product of two 5s, which consists of the antisymmetric product of the
two 3s (a 3), the antisymmetric product of the two su(2) doublets, and the product
of one of each:

5  (3, 0, 1

3)  (1, 1

2, 1
3)  (1, 0, 1)  (3, 1

2 ) = qr+  ll

10  (3, 0, 2

exercise ivb4.1

find the symmetric product of 2 5s, and its decomposition into representa-
tions of su(3)su(2)u(1).

a more unifying model is based on so(10). a u(5) subgroup can be found from
the spinor representation by dividing up the set of 10 dirac  matrices into two
halves, and taking complex combinations to get 5 sets of anticommuting creation and
annihilation operators. (see exercise ic1.2.) the dirac spinor is then

(1, 5

2)  (5, 3

2)  (10, 1

2)  (10, 1

2 )  (5, 3

2)  (1, 5
2)

in terms of the su(5) representation and the u(1) charge. this dirac spinor is

reducible into weyl spinors 16  16; in fact, i21 is just (1)y +1/2 in terms of the

b. standard model

247

u(1) charge y . (the so(10) generators are even in oscillators, and thus do not mix
even levels with odd.) we then have

16  (1, 5

2)  (10, 1

2)  (5, 3
2)

ignoring the u(1) charge, these are the multiplets found for each family in the su(5)
gut, plus an extra singlet.

a simple way to understand this extra singlet is to look at a dierent path of
breaking to su(3)su(2)u(1): looking at the vector (dening) representation of
so(10), we can break it up as 6+4 (in the same way we broke up the 5 of su(5)
as 3+2) to get the subgroup so(6)so(4)=su(4)su(2)su(2). we can also see
that a dirac spinor of so(10) (1616) will be a dirac spinor of so(6) (44) times
(not plus) a dirac spinor of so(4), while the dirac spinor of so(4) is a dening
representation of one su(2) (( 1
2,0)) plus a dening representation of the other su(2)
((0, 1

2)). thus,

16  (4, 1

2, 0)  (4, 0, 1
2)

where we have used the fact that 1 (used for projection to weyl spinors) of so(10)
is proportional to the product of all the -matrices, and thus the product of 1s for
so(6) and so(4).

looking at this model (pati-salam model) as an alternative to su(5) (but with
a semisimple, rather than simple, group, so it unies only spin 1/2, not spin 1), we
now look at breaking su(4)u(3)= su(3)u(1) (using 4=3+1, as we did 5=3+2
for su(5)), and breaking one su(2) u(1). we then nd

(4, 0, 1

2 )  (3, 1

(4, 1

3, 1
2, 0)  (1, 1, 1
2, 0)  (3, 1
2)  (3, 1
3, 0, 1
3, 0, 1
= qr+  qr  lr  lr

2)  (1,1, 0, 1

2 , 0) = ql  ll

2)  (1,1, 0, 1
2)

where the arguments are the su(3) representation, the u(1) charge from su(4),
the su(2) isospin, and the u(1) charge from the broken su(2).
if we choose the
u(1) charge of su(3)su(2)u(1) as 1/2 times the former of these two u(1)
charges plus 1 times the latter, this agrees with the result obtained by way of su(5).
however, we now see that all the left-handed fermions are contained within one
su(4)su(2)su(2) multiplet, and the right-handed within another, but with a
partner for the neutrino. also, one of the su(2)s is that of su(3)su(2)u(1),
while the other is the other su(2) of the standard model, which was broken explic-
itly there to u(1), whereas here it is broken spontaneously. thus, there is a local
chiral su(2)su(2) avor symmetry.

furthermore, the su(4)su(2)su(2) model is invariant under c: in general, c
is just a permutation symmetry. in this case, it simply switches the two multiplets
of each family,

combining with the usual cp, this model is thus also invariant under p:

c :

2, 0)  (4, 0, 1
2)

p :

2, 0)  (4, 0, 1

i.e.,

(4, 1

2, 0)   .(4, 0, 1
2)

but both c and p are broken spontaneously on reduction to the standard model.
however, so(10) lacks c and p invariance (contrary to some statements in the liter-
ature), since there is only a single complex representation for each family of fermions
(and thus no nontrivial c; of course, there is still cp, at least for the vector-spinor
coupling, as always). in fact, the c of su(4)su(2)su(2) is just an so(10) trans-
formation: although so(10) is not o(10) (which is why it lacks a c), it still includes
reections in an even number of axes, since reection in any pair of axes is a  rota-
tion (just as for so(2)). thus, breaking 10  6 + 4 includes not only so(6)so(4),
but also the reection of an odd number of the 6 axes together with an odd number
of the 4 axes  a combined parity of both so(6) and so(4). (they are all the
same up to continuous so(6)so(4) transformations.) this parity of the internal
space is the c given above. (we saw a similar situation for o(2) in subsection ivb1.)

the identication of c is somewhat semantic in a nonabelian gauge theory (ex-
cept for unbroken u(1) subgroups), since it is dened by changes in sign of unobserved
charges: the c appearing above at an intermediate stage of breaking of the so(10)
gut originates as a global symmetry of only the higgs sector, leaving all funda-
mental particles with spin invariant. after breaking to su(4)su(2)su(2), the
vectors and the spinors are composites of the original ones and the higgs responsible
for the breaking, so they pick up this symmetry.
(in the same way, the spinning
particles of the standard model pick up the broken global su(2) of its higgs.)

b. standard model

249

since guts unify quarks and leptons, they allow decay of the proton. however,
since this requires simultaneous decay of all 3 quarks into 3 leptons, it is an extremely
unlikely (i.e, slow) decay, but barely within limits of experiment, depending on the
model. proton decay is still unobserved: this eliminates the simplest version of the
su(5) gut.

in section iic we studied some general properties of supersymmetry in arbitrary
dimensions, and its representations in d=4. we now consider 4d interactions, by
introducing gauge elds dened on superspace, and their actions. a complete dis-
cussion of supersymmetry would require (at least) a semester; but here we give more
than just an overview, and include the basic tools with examples, which is enough for
many applications. quantum aspects of supersymmetry will be discussed in chapters
vi and viii, supergravity in chapter x, and some aspects of superstrings in chapter
xi.

1. chiral

we rst consider some eld equations that appear in all free, massless, super-
symmetric theories. of course, since the theory is massless it satises the massless
klein-gordon equation by denition:  = 0. from our earlier discussion of general
.
q = 0. these dont
properties of supersymmetry, we also know that p
 = p
look covariant, but noticing that pq diers from pd only by 
terms (because of the
index contraction), which already vanishes, we have the eld equations

.
 q.

.
 d.

p

 = p

.
d = 0

these equations imply the klein-gordon equation, as seen by hitting them with
another d and using the anticommutation relations {d, d.
.
. they imply
stronger equations: by evaluating at  = 0, d yields a spinor component eld ,
and we nd

} = p

.
 .

p

 = p

.
 = 0

the usual for massless spin 1/2.

another equation that can be imposed is the chirality condition

d . = 0

where  now refers to such a chiral supereld (and thus  to an antichiral one,
d  = 0). this requires that  be complex, otherwise we would also have d = 0
and thus p = 0 by the anticommutation relations. the component expansion is
given completely by just the ds and not the ds:

| = a,

(d)| = ,

(d2)| = b

252

iv. mixed

where a and b are complex scalars, and we use the normalization

d2 = 1

2dd

all other components are x-derivatives of these, since the ds can be pushed past the
ds (producing ps) until they annihilate . another way to state this is to use the
fact

.
p

.


d = eu/2eu/2,

d . = eu/2  .eu/2;

to solve the chirality constraint as

(x, , ) = eu/2 (x, )

u =  

where  is independent of : it is dened on chiral superspace. (in this equation u
generates a complex coordinate transformation.) another way to solve the chirality
constraint is to use the covariant derivatives: since ddd = 0 by anticommutativity
(and similarly for ds),

d . = 0   = d2

where  is a general (unconstrained) complex supereld. it is the prepotential
for the eld .

exercise ivc1.1

lets analyze the supersymmetry generators q, q . in this case.

a find similar expressions for q, q in terms of eu/2.
b find q, q on  in terms of just  and / (no  nor / ).

exercise ivc1.2

show that the prepotential has a gauge invariance, under which  is invariant.
(hint: use the same identity that led to the prepotential.)

from the anticommutation relations we nd
., d2] = p .d
[ d

since this must vanish on , we nd

dd2 = d .d2 = 0  p

.
d2 = 0  d2 = constant

(we can safely ignore this constant, at least when considering the free theory: it
corresponds to a term in the action linear in the elds.) this eld equation, together
with the chirality constraint, is sucient to determine the theory: a is the usual free
(complex) scalar,  is the usual free spinor, and b is a constant.

c. supersymmetry

253

to describe interactions of this (scalar) multiplet, we keep the chirality condi-
tion, since that greatly simplies the eld content of the supereld. in fact, this is
clearly the simplest o-shell supereld we can dene, since it already has the smallest
number of fermions (as do the coordinates of chiral superspace). (o shell means
all components less gauge degrees of freedom.) this means that the equation d2 = 0
will be generalized, since it implies the klein-gordon equation. the simplest way to
do this is by constructing an explicit action, our next topic.

2. actions

the construction of actions in superspace is dierent from ordinary theories be-
cause the geometrically simple objects, the potentials, are constrained, while the un-
constrained objects, the prepotentials, can be awkward to work with directly. (this
problem is magnied with extended supersymmetry, whose actions we dont consider
here.)

we start with the simplest supermultiplet, the chiral supereld. since chiral
superelds are dened on chiral superspace, a natural generalization of a potential
(nonderivative) term in the action to superspace is

s1 =z dx d2 f () + h.c.

in terms of some function (not functional) f of chiral superelds  (the superpoten-
tial). we can ignore any  dependence because it contributes only total derivatives:

 = eu/2 (x, )  f () = eu/2f ( )

integration over  is dened as in subsection ia2; however, now we can replace partial
derivatives with covariant ones, since the modication is again only by total deriva-
tives:

z dx d2 =z dx d2

with an appropriate normalization. this turns out to be the most convenient one,
since it allows covariant manipulations of the action, and the  integration can be per-
formed covariantly: since we know that the result of  integration gives a lagrangian
that depends only on x, up to total derivative terms, we can evaluate it as

z dx d2 f () =z dx [d2f ()]|

=z dx [f(|)(d2)| + f(|) 1

2(d)|(d)|]

254

iv. mixed

(suppressing indices on multiple s). this gives the result directly in terms of com-
ponent elds, using the covariant method of dening the component expansion: in
the conventions of the previous subsection, this part of the action becomes

z dx [f(a)b + f(a) 1

2 ]

we now consider integration over the full superspace. as a generalization of the

above, we can write

z dx d4 k(, ) =z dx (d2 d2k)|

supersymmetric versions of nonlinear  models can be written in this way; here we
consider just the case where k is quadratic, which is the one interesting for quantum
theory. since a function of just  (or just ) will give zero in the d4 integral, we
choose

k =    s0 = z dx d4 

explicitly,

l0 = d2 d2( ) = d2( d2 ) = ( 1

)d  ( d2 )(d2)

) + (i

a + i

where we have used the commutation relations of the covariant derivatives to push all
ds past ds to hit . clearly, this term by itself reproduces the results derived in the
previous subsection based on kinematics, so it is the desired massless kinetic term.

we can now see the inuence of adding the superpotential term to the action:
the result of combining the two terms, and then eliminating the auxiliary eld b by
its equation of motion, is

s0 + s1  l = a 1

a + i

 + |f(a)|2 + [f(a) 1

2 + h.c.]

for example, a quadratic f gives mass to the physical scalar and spinor. this action is
invariant under modied supersymmetry transformations, where the auxiliary elds
are replaced by their equations of motion there also; those transformations then
become nonlinear in the presence of interactions. note that the scalar potential is
positive denite; this is a consequence of supersymmetry, since it implies that the
energy is always positive.

exercise ivc2.1

these results generalize straightforwardly:

a find the explicit form of the component-eld action for arbitrary k(i, i)
and f (i) for an arbitrary number of chiral superelds i, including all indices.

c. supersymmetry

255

b eliminate the auxiliary elds from the action, and nd the modied super-

symmetry transformations.

c show by direct evaluation that the action is still invariant.
as a notational convenience, we can drop the | after expanding a superspace

action in components: for example, we can write simply

 = d,

b = d2

after performing the -integration as above by using derivatives d and d, and then
evaluating these derivatives on  by writing  and b, the component action is
.
expressed completely in terms of such superelds and only spacetime derivatives 
.
this component action is independent of  (the lagrangian is independent up to total
spacetime derivatives): this is the statement of supersymmetry invariance. thus, we
can choose to evaluate at  = 0, or  = , or whatever; it is irrelevant. it is then
understood that the relation to the usual component actions is simply to treat the

supereld as a component eld, since the -derivatives (in d and r d) have been

eliminated. from now on we will generally drop the |s.

the above results can also be derived from the supereld equations of motion
by varying the action. since  is constrained, it cant be varied arbitrarily; we vary
instead the prepotential  ( = d2). for example, we nd d2 = 0 (and the complex
conjugate) from the free action. eectively, since chiral superelds are essentially
independent of , not only integration is modied, but also (functional) variation.
since a chiral supereld is (up to a transformation) an arbitrary function on chiral
superspace, we dene

s[] =z dx d2 ()

s


for an arbitrary variation of a chiral supereld , and similarly for varying .
evaluating such variations, we make use of the identities

in

z dx d4 l =z dx d2 d2l

d2d2 = 1

2 

( d2d2 d2 = 1
2

d2)

thus, to vary a general action, it is convenient to rst integrate over , and then vary
in the naive way: for example,

s = z dx d4  +(cid:20)z dx d2 f () + h.c.(cid:21)

 0 =

s


=  d2  + f()

256

iv. mixed

exercise ivc2.2

check for this action that the component expansion of the supereld equations
of motion agree with the variation of the corresponding component action.

3. covariant derivatives

the supersymmetric generalization of nonabelian gauge theories can be derived by
similar methods. we rst write the supersymmetry covariant derivatives collectively
as

da = (d, d .,  .) = ea

m m

m = (, ., m) = /zm ,

zm = (, 

., xm)

unlike the nonsupersymmetric case, the vielbein ea
at superspace, and thus the torsion t is nonvanishing:

m has  dependence even in

cdc
[da, db} = tab
..
 . = i





,

 . = t.

.
t


rest = 0

we now gauge-covariantize all the supersymmetry-covariant derivatives:

a = da + iaa
the covariant eld strengths are then dened as

[a,b} = tab

cc + ifab

from our analysis of general representations of supersymmetry in d=4 in subsection
iic5, we know that the simplest supersymmetrization of yang-mills is to include a
spinor with the vector, in terms of physical degrees of freedom.
(the spinor and
vector each have two physical degrees of freedom, one for each sign of the helicity.)
o shell, fermi and bose components must still balance, so there must also be an
auxiliary scalar. from dimensional analysis, the eld strengths must therefore satisfy

f = f .

.

.

.

, f .,

where w| is the physical spinor.

the constant piece of the torsion implies stronger relations among the eld
strengths than in nonsupersymmetric theories. for super yang-mills we nd from
the jacobi identity for the covariant derivatives the bianchi identity for the eld
strengths

[afbc) = t[ab|

dfd|c)

c. supersymmetry

257

specically, the dimension-1 constraints above on the eld strengths imply the dimen-
sion-3/2 algebraic constraint that denes w, as well as

2(w)

they also imply that w is covariantly chiral and satises a reality condition,

 .w = 0,

w + 

.w . = 0

the most straightforward way to derive these results is to just evaluate the jacobi
identities directly. we begin with a weaker set of conditions, both of dimension 1, that
will be found (in the following subsection) to be necessary and sucient for solving
explicitly. one directly determines the vector derivative in terms of the spinor ones:

f

 = 0  i . = {, .}
.

since one could always dene the vector covariant derivative this way, imposing this
condition simply eliminates redundant degrees of freedom.

the remaining constraint (including its complex conjugate) allows coupling of

super yang-mills to the chiral supereld:

 . = 0  0 = { .,.

} = if .

.


it also implies the maintenance of certain free identities, such as

 = 1

2 [,] + 1

2{,} = c2

(such constraints appear also for rst quantization, e.g., in superstring theory, when-
ever a supersymmetric system is put in a background of a supersymmetric gauge eld
of higher superspin. this should not be confused with background eld equations
imposed by any gauge system put in a background of the same type: see subsection
vib8.)

thus, our minimal set of constraints can be written directly in terms of the eld

strengths as

f = f .

.

 = 0

but for our purposes it will prove more convenient to write them directly as (anti)com-
mutators:

explicitly evaluate all the remaining jacobi identities, and show that they
imply no further conditions on w.

4. prepotential

we saw in the previous subsection that coupling super yang-mills to matter gave
directly one of the minimal constraints on the super yang-mills elds themselves.
hence, as for ordinary yang-mills, the denition of the gauge theory follows from
considering the transformation of matter, and generalizing it to a local symmetry. as
for self-dual yang-mills (see subsection iiic5), the vanishing of some eld strengths
implies that part of the covariant derivative is pure gauge:

however, since {,.
plex. we therefore have the covariantly chiral supereld

{,} = 0   = ede
} 6= 0, this gauge transformation  (prepotential) is com-

 . = 0,  . = e d .e    = e  ,

d .

 = 0

alternatively, we could combine this exponential with that already contained in the
free spinor derivative:

 = eu/2eu/2+,  = eu/2+  ,

 .

 = 0

u + 2 is the analog of the covariant derivative for the yang-mills prepotential. this
is a hint at supergravity: u is just the at piece of the supergravity prepotential.
we thus see that supersymmetry automatically gives gravity the interpretation of the
gauge theory of translations.

c. supersymmetry

259

component expansions are now dened with yang-mills-covariant derivatives:

 = ,
w = f + icd,

2 = b
2w = i

.
w .


where we have used the bianchi identities for w , and f (not to be confused with f)
is the usual yang-mills eld strength (in spinor notation). the vector multiplet
thus consists of the component elds aa (the gauge eld whose strength is f ), w,
and d (auxiliary). (as explained earlier, we drop all |s.)

note that the gauge parameter is real, while the matter multiplet is (covariantly)
chiral. the resolution of this apparent inconsistency is that solving the constraints
introduces a new gauge invariance, just as solving the source-free half of maxwells
equations (really just constraints, not eld equations) introduces the potential and
its gauge invariance:

a = eikaeik,  = ede  e

= ei eeik,

d  = 0

 = eik,  = e     = ei 

this suggests the denition of a new (chiral) representation, where we use the
obvious eld  and the chiral gauge parameter  replaces the real one k: making a
nonunitary similarity transformation,

 = e ,

ba = e ae   b . = d .,
ba = eibaei,

 = e   d .
ev 

= ei ev ei

b = ev dev ,

 = 0,

 = ( )ev

ev = ee 

alternatively, we can also include u in the transformation as above; then u and v
appear only in the combination u + v .

exercise ivc4.1

show that the explicit expression for the eld strength w in terms of the
prepotential v in the chiral representation is

w = i d2(ev dev )

show this expression is chiral.

exercise ivc4.2

in the abelian case, give an explicit component expansion of the prepotential
v , such that the vector potential aa, the physical spinor w, and the auxiliary

260

iv. mixed

eld d appear as independent components. note that the other components
do not appear explicitly in component expansions when gauge-covariant ex-
pansion (...|) is used. the component (nonsupersymmetric) gauge where
these components are set to vanish is the wess-zumino gauge, and is the 
part of the radial gauge of subsection vib1 below.

exercise ivc4.3

for some purposes (like quantization) we need the explicit form of an in-
nitesimal gauge transformation of v . show this can be written as

v = ilv /2[( + ) + coth(lv /2)(  )]

(hint: consider ev ev , and think of  as an operator, as for the expansion
of  = ev dev . la was dened in subsection ia3.)

5. gauge actions

generalization of actions to super yang-mills theory is straightforward. matter
coupling is achieved simply by replacing the chiral superelds of the matter multiplets
with yang-mills-covariantly chiral superelds. the coupling can be seen explicitly in
the chiral representation: in the kinetic term,

 = ( )ev 

while in ther d2 term all v -dependence drops out because of gauge invariance. (the

superpotential is a gauge invariant function of the s, and the transformation to the
chiral representation is a complex gauge transformation. the fact that the gauge
transformation is complex is irrelevant, since the superpotential depends only on 
and not .) component expansion can be performed covariantly by replacing ds with
s in the denition of  integration: since the lagrangian is a gauge singlet, this is
the same acting on it, although individual terms in the expansion dier because the
elds are not singlets. similarly, d2 can be replaced with 
also when performing 
integration for purposes of varying an action with respect to a chiral supereld. this
is equivalent to gauge covariantizing the functional derivative (e.g., by transforming
from a chiral representation) as

2

(x, )
(x, )

2

= 

(x  x)4(  )

usually we will drop the b s on  and , when the representation is clear from the

context by the use of explicit v s.

c. supersymmetry

261

the action for super yang-mills itself follows from dimensional analysis: since
each  integral is really a  derivative, d2 integration has mass dimension +1, the
same as a spacetime derivative. since the lagrangian for a physical spinor, in this
case w , has a single such derivative, dimensional analysis says the action must be

ssy m =  1

g2 trz dx d2 1

2w w

where the (covariant) chirality of w  allows integration over chiral superspace. (sim-
for

ilar analysis applies to the matter multiplet, wherer d4 takes the place of a
the scalar .) replacingr d2  2, we evaluate the component expansion as

2f f + w i

.
w .

  d2)

ssy m = 1

g2 trz dx ( 1

another term we can write, for superelectromagnetism (supersymmetrization of an
abelian gauge theory) is the fayet-iliopoulos term

sf i = z dx d4 v = z dx d

which involves only the auxiliary eld d. (the analog for the chiral scalar supereld

isr dx d2 .)

exercise ivc5.1

derive the supersymmetric analog of the stuckelberg model of subsection
iva5, by coupling an abelian vector multiplet to a massless chiral scalar
multiplet using the symmetry generator t dened there. (g  it in trans-
formation laws, covariant derivatives, etc., on , where t  = 1  t 2 = 0.)
a to couple the gauge eld it is necessary to start, as usual, with a (quadratic)

matter action that is globally invariant under this symmetry:

s0 =z dx d4 1

2 (  )2

(at this point this is the usual, since only the cross-term survives, but this
will not be the case for the covariantly chiral superelds.) find the super-
symmetric gauge coupling, and express the resulting action in terms of v and
.

b use this result to nd the mass term for v in the gauge  = 0.

another interesting form of the action uses a generalization of the chern-simons
form dened in the discussion of instantons in subsection iiic6. in superspace, the
calculation of the eld strength with curved indices is modied to

m = em

aa = m + iam , i[m ,n} = fm n = em

aen

bfab

262

iv. mixed

where we have left sign factors from index reordering in the last equation implicit.
although the curved-index expressions are not as useful (for example, for seeing which
components vanish by constraints), we can see easily that some arguments used in
nonsupersymmetric theories carry over to superspace. thus, we can dene the super
chern-simons form by

8tr f[m n fp q) = 1

6[m bn p q)

bm n p = tr( 1

the multiplets and couplings we have considered are sucient to write a super-
symmetric generalization of the standard model. unfortunately, supersymmetry pro-
vides no unication. to get the right symmetry breaking, it turns out to be necessary
to provide a supersymmetry multiplet for each particle of the standard model: the
spin-1 gauge bosons are accompanied by spin-1/2 gauginos (gluinos, photino,
wino, zino), the spin-1/2 leptons by spin-0 sleptons, the quarks by squarks,
and the spin-0 higgs by spin-1/2 higgsinos. furthermore, since a reality condition

c. supersymmetry

263

cant be imposed on chiral scalar multiplets, the higgs scalars are themselves doubled.
ultimately, the success of supersymmetry depends on the experimental detection of
these particles.

6. breaking

the methods of the section iva can be generalized straightforwardly to supersym-
metric theories: goldstone bosons and higgs elds become supermultiplets, etc. how-
ever, to obtain realistic models supersymmetry itself must be broken, since fermions
and bosons with similar mass and other properties are not observed in nature. more
specically, since gravity is observed, any supersymmetric theory of the world must
include supergravity, and thus the breaking must be spontaneous. (explicit breaking
would violate gauge invariance.) then the gravitino, which gauges supersymmetry,
will become massive by a superhiggs mechanism, by eating a goldstone fermion. (see
subsections xb6-7. if the graviton and gravitino are treated as composites, then this
fermion could also be a composite.)

we saw in subsection iic1 that energy is always nonnegative in supersymmetric
theories. in particular, from the same arguments used there we see that a state can be
invariant under supersymmetry (q|i = q|i = 0) if and only if it has zero energy.
any such state can be identied as the vacuum, since no state has lower energy.
this means that the only way to guarantee spontaneous supersymmetry breaking is
to choose a theory which has no zero-energy state. (note that energy is uniquely
dened by the supersymmetry algebra; there is no possibility of adding a constant
as in nonsupersymmetric theories.) in theories with extended supersymmetry, the
relation between supersymmetry and energy applies for each supersymmetry; thus
supersymmetry is either completely broken spontaneously or completely unbroken.
(an exception is central charges, which modify the supersymmetry algebra: see the
following subsection.)

furthermore, physical scalars appear at  = 0 in matter multiplets, while auxiliary
elds appear at higher order. since supersymmetry breaking requires  dependence
in a vacuum value of a supereld, this means an auxiliary eld must get a vacuum
value.

a simple example of spontaneous supersymmetry breaking is the oraifeartaigh

model; it has the lagrangian

lor = z d4

3xi=1

ii +(cid:20)z d2 (1 + m23 + 12

2) + h.c.(cid:21)

264

to study symmetry breaking we ignore derivative terms, since vacuum values are
constants. then the scalar eld equations are:



bi   bi + if = 0 :  b1 +  + a2

2 =  b2 + ma3 + 2a1a2 =  b3 + ma2 = 0


ai  bjijf = 0 :

2a2b2 = mb3 + 2a2b1 + 2a1b2 = mb2 = 0

(where i = /ai on the superpotential f (a)). since there is no solution for bi = 0,
supersymmetry breaking is required.
in general, for superpotential f (), the eld
equations for b = 0 are f(a) = 0, so a linear term is always needed for supersym-
metry breaking.

such breaking, since it also is a linear term of an auxiliary eld.

for simplicity (as in this chapter), we may want to ignore supergravity; however,
we still need to take account of its contribution to breaking global supersymmetry via
the superhiggs eect. the net low-energy contribution from the supergravity elds
(assuming no cosmological constant is generated) is to introduce eective explicit
supersymmetry breaking: although the original theory is locally supersymmetric, we
neglect the supergravity elds but not their vacuum values (in particular, those of
the auxiliary elds). in particular, if the supergravity elds are bound states, then
this procedure is essentially the classical introduction of nonperturbative quantum
eects.

thus we consider adding terms to the classical action that break supersymmetry
explicitly. the easiest way to do this is to introduce constant superelds (spurions);
this allows us to continue to take advantage of the superspace formalism (at both
the classical and quantum levels). since we are neglecting (super)gravity, and in
particular its nonrenormalizability (see chapter vii), we consider only terms that will
preserve the quantum properties of the unbroken theories. this will clearly be the
case if we consider only the usual terms, with some elds replaced by spurions: this
is equivalent to using background (xed) elds, in addition to (but in the same way
as) the usual eld variables, performing all (classical/quantum) calculations as usual,

c. supersymmetry

265

and then setting the background elds (specically, the auxiliary elds, which are
responsible for breaking supersymmetry) to constants.

thus, introducing constant (in x) chiral and real spurion elds

 = 2c,

v = 2 2r

in terms of complex and real parameters c and r, in addition to the true elds  and
v , we have terms of the form

z d2 [, 2, 3, w 2, ( d2dv)w],

z d2 d2  v ev 

(and complex conjugates). these terms can preserve the usual gauge invariances, and
can be shown to also preserve the desirable quantum properties of supersymmetry:
the condition is that replacing the spurion eld by 1 (instead of its above value)
gives either 0 or a conventional term (one with coupling constant of nonnegative
mass dimension). another way to introduce these spurions (except perhaps for the
v crossterm, which is less useful) is as coupling constants, rather than as elds:
instead of introducing new terms to the action, we generalize the old ones, so the
constant part of each coupling is the usual coupling, while its -dependent terms
produce the breaking.

7. extended

the supersymmetry we discussed earlier in this chapter, with a single spinor coor-
dinate, is called simple (n=1) supersymmetry; the generalization to many spinors is
called extended (n>1) supersymmetry (for n spinor coordinates). n=1 supersym-
metric theories, at least for spins1, are most conveniently described by superspace
methods. (there are also some denite advantages for n=1 supergravity at the quan-
tum level.) on the other hand, the technical diculties of extended superspace often

266

iv. mixed

outweigh the advantages. (the main advantage of extended superspace is proving cer-
tain properties of the quantum theories. of course, extended supersymmetric theories
are complicated in any case.) alternative formulations of extended supersymmetry
are either

(1) on shell,

(2) in terms of components (ordinary spacetime, not superspace), or

(3) in simple superspace (manifesting only one of the supersymmetries).

by going half way, using n=1 superelds to describe extended supersymmetry,
some of the advantages of the superspace approach can be retained. in this subsection
we will list some of the extended supersymmetric actions for lower spins in n=1
superspace form. these actions can be obtained by: (1) using extended superspace
to derive the component eld equations (usually using dimensional reduction: see
subsections xc5-6), and combining components into n=1 superelds, or (2) writing
the extra supersymmetries in n=1 superspace form, and using them to determine the
action.

the simplest example is n=2 supersymmetry. as for any extended supersymme-
try, its algebra can be modied by including abelian generators z (with dimensions
of mass), called central charges:

} = j

i p

.
,

{qi., qj.

} = c .

{qi, qj} = ccijz,

{qi, qj.
(where i = 1, 2). in terms of dimensional reduction (for n=2, from d=5 or 6; see
subsections xc5-6), the origin of these generators can be understood as the higher-
dimensional components of the momentum. n=2 supersymmetry is sometimes called
hypersymmetry, and n=2 supermultiplets, hypermultiplets.

[z, q] = [z, q] = 0

.
c ijz;

our rst example is the free, massive n=2 scalar multiplet: since we already

know the eld content (see subsection iic5), its easy to write the free lagrangian

lsm,n =2 = z d4 i

i + 1

2(cid:18)z d2 mij

ij + h.c.(cid:19)

where the index i is for an extra su(2) (not the one acting on the supersymmetry
generators), broken by the mass term, and the mass matrix mij is symmetric while
j = ckimkj is hermitian. in other words, it represents a 3-vector of this su(2),
mi
and thus a generator of the preserved u(1) subgroup, which we have used to dene
the central charge:

zi = mi

j

c. supersymmetry

267

the other n=2 multiplet of low spin is the vector multiplet. it also has a simple

lagrangian,

lsy m,n =2 =  1

g2 tr(cid:18)z d2 w 2 +z d4 (cid:19)

where  is covariantly chiral and in the adjoint representation of the yang-mills gauge
group. in the abelian case, we can also add an n=2 fayet-iliopoulos term,

lf i,n =2 =z d4 0v +(cid:18)z d2 + + h.c.(cid:19)

where (0, +, ) ( = +*) is a constant 3-vector of the su(2) of the n=2 super-
symmetry: the 3 scalar auxiliary elds of this n=2 multiplet form a 3-vector of the
su(2). unlike the previous example, this multiplet has all the auxiliary elds needed
for an o-shell n=2 superspace formulation: not only do the physical components
balance between bosons and fermions (4 of each), but also the auxiliary ones (also 4
of each).

these 2 n=2 multiplets can be coupled: the scalar multiplet action is modied

to

lsm,n =2 = z d4 i

i + 1

2(cid:20)z d2  ij

i( + m)j + h.c.(cid:21)

where now i is also a representation of the yang-mills group (not necessarily ad-
joint), with respect to which it is covariantly chiral. however, the same su(2) matrix
 that appears in the mass matrix mij = mij now also appears with the n=2
super yang-mills elds,

where gn are the usual yang-mills group generators. (without loss of generality, we

exactly the same way as an abelian n=2 vector multiplet that has been replaced by
a vacuum value for its physical scalars. this can also be seen from the commutation
relations for the n=2 super yang-mills covariant derivatives (see below), since the
scalars appear in exactly the same way as the central charge.

by our earlier helicity arguments, the only n=3 supersymmetric theory with spins
 1 is n=3 super yang-mills. the analogous statement also holds for n=4, while
no such theories exist for n>4. since theories with n supersymmetries are a subset
of those with only n1 supersymmetries, n=3 and n=4 super yang-mills must be
the same: counting states of supersymmetry representations, we see that this theory
is the same as n=2 super yang-mills coupled to one n=2 scalar multiplet in the

268

iv. mixed

adjoint representation (in direct analogy to n=2 super yang-mills in terms of n=1
multiplets). in terms of n=1 multiplets, this is super yang-mills plus 3 adjoint scalar
multiplets. the action then follows from the above results (without central charges
and fayet-iliopoulos terms):

lsy m,n =4 = 1

g2 tr(cid:20)z d2 w 2 z d4 ii +(cid:18)z d2 1

6 ijki[j, k] + h.c.(cid:19)(cid:21)

where i is a u(3) index. (the u(1) part of the u(3) symmetry involves also a phase
transformation of the s.)

for comparison, here are the general (uv well-behaved) actions for all numbers

of supersymmetries (in d=4):

ln =1 =  1

ln =2 =  1

2w w + z d4 v z d4 ev  +(cid:20)z d2 f () + h.c.(cid:21)

where we now use ordinary chiral superelds, making dependence on v explicit.

as for o-shell n=1 supersymmetry, much information on extended supersym-
metric gauge theories can be gained by examining the properties of the covariant
derivatives and their eld strengths. in fact, this is more true in the extended case,
where the obvious constraints often imply eld equations (which is more than one
would want for an o-shell formulation). the empty-space covariant derivatives are
the direct generalization of n=1: introducing n s as i (and complex conjugate

the former equations then allow us to interpret the remaining covariant derivatives
i . as a subset of the sl(2|n) generators that rotate the a index, which form a

subgroup of the superconformal group (s)sl(4|n). we therefore restrict ourselves to
the chiral superspace described by the coordinates
za = (x ., i)

the net result is that we have a superspace with no torsion, with coordinates that
represent half of the supersymmetries as translations and the other half as rotations.

by comparison with our treatment of the self-dual bosonic theory in subsections
iiic5-7, we see that we can extend trivially all our results for the bosonic case to the
(extended) supersymmetric case by simply extending the range of the indices. in par-
ticular, we also have a chiral twistor superspace: extending the range on the twistor
coordinates za used there so a is now an sl(4|n) index, the superconformal group
is now manifest, and all the methods and results there (e.g., the adhm construction)
apply automatically to the supersymmetric case.

v. quantization

part two: quanta

many important new features show up in eld theory at the quantum level. prob-
ably the most important is renormalizability, which states that all the parameters
(masses and couplings) that appear as coecients of terms in the action must have
nonnegative mass dimension (when the massless part of the kinetic term has no di-

mensionful coecient). since the action is dimensionless, r d4x has dimension 4,

and the elds have positive dimension, this allows only a small number of terms for
any given set of elds. this one condition gives relativistic quantum eld theory more
predictive power than any known alternative.

there are many perturbation expansions that can be applied to quantum eld
theory. one is the mechanical jwkb expansion, which is an expansion in derivatives.
of the inherently eld theoretical expansions, the simplest is to expand directly in
elds, or equivalently, in the coupling constants. this expansion is the basis of per-
turbative quantum eld theory. however, this expansion does not preserve gauge
invariance term by term. on the other hand, the terms in this expansion can be
collected into small subsets that do preserve gauge invariance. there are three such
regroupings, discussed in the four following chapters, and they are based on pertur-
bation expansions:

(1) the eld theoretic jwkb (loop) expansion,

(2) expansions in spin or helicity, and

(3) expansions in internal symmetry (color or avor).

v. quantization

for the most part, integrals are hard to evaluate, in particular the path integrals of
exponentials that appear in quantum theory. the only exponentials that are generally
easy to integrate are gaussians, and the products of them times polynomials, which
can in turn be evaluated as derivatives of gaussians. such integrals are the basis of
perturbation theory: we keep the quadratic part of the action, but taylor expand the
exponential of higher-order terms. eectively, this means that we not only expand
in orders of h to perturb about the classical theory, but also expand in orders of the
coupling constants to perturb about the free theory. this makes particularly useful
our analysis of relativistic quantum mechanics (as free eld theory). the jwkb
expansion for the wave function (or s-matrix) expands the exponent in powers of h,
dividing it onto three qualitatively dierent parts:

a. general

273

(1) negative powers of h (generally 1/h only), which describe the classical theory
(they dominate the classical limit h  0), whose physical implications have been
considered in previous chapters;

(2) h-independent, where almost all of the important (perturbative) quantum fea-
tures appear (including topological ones, and quantum breaking of classical sym-
metries); and

(3) positive powers, which give more quantum corrections, but little new physics,

except when summed to all orders.

these are generally known as trees, one-loop, and multiloop, because of their
graphical interpretation.

in the schrodinger approach to quantum mechanics one solves a dierential equa-
tion. the feynman approach is complementary: there one performs an integral.

integrals are solutions to dierential equations (e.g., f = g  f =r g), but usually

dierential equations are easier to solve than integral equations. however, there is an
important exception: gaussian integrals are easy, and so are their boundary condi-
tions. in eld theory the most important approximation is one where the integrand
is approximated as a gaussian, and the exact integral is evaluated as a perturbation
about that gaussian. of course, solving the corresponding dierential equation is
also easy, but in that case the integral is easier because it corresponds to working
with the action, while the dierential equation corresponds to working with the eld
equations.

a major advantage of feynmans approach is that it allows space and time to
be treated on an equal footing. for example, as in classical electrodynamics, we
can solve the wave equation inside a spacetime volume in terms of conditions on the
boundary of that volume: it is not necessary to choose the spatial boundary at innity
so that it can be ignored, and divide the temporal boundary into its future and
past halves so that all conditions are initial ones imposed at the past boundary.
it is not even necessary to distinguish between preparation (if) and measurement
(then) when describing probabilities: we can instead ask the probability of a given
wave function describing the whole boundary. this is a particular advantage for
relativistic quantum eld theory, where space and time are more closely related than
in nonrelativistic theories. we now review feynmans approach for general quantum
systems, and quantum mechanics in particular, so that it can be applied without
further explanation when we come to quantum eld theory.

274

v. quantization

1. path integrals

before discussing the path integral approach to quantum mechanics, we rst re-
view some features of quantum mechanics. we can separate the fundamentals of
quantum mechanics into kinematics and dynamics: the kinematics are every-
thing at a xed time  hilbert space, preparation/measurement, probability, observ-
ables. the dynamics are the time development. there are several ways to describe
time dependence of matrix elements; we will start with a general framework, then
specialize.

time dependence may be associated with either the states (schrodinger picture)
or operators (heisenberg picture). we will be more explicit at rst, taking all the time
dependence out of the states and operators and putting it into a time development
operator u(t, t) that transforms the hilbert space from time t (earlier) to time t
(later). for example, if we want to relate an earlier state to a later one we evaluate
hf|u(t, t)|ii; more generally, we can look at things like
hf|...o2u(t2, t1)o1u(t1, ti)|ii

which means to prepare an initial state |ii at time ti, then act with an operator o1
at time t1, operator o2 at time t2, etc., and eventually measure the amplitude for a
nal state hf|.

now the dynamics can be described entirely through the properties of u. the

general physical properties it must satisfy are

causality (locality) :

unitarity :

u(t3, t2)u(t2, t1) = u(t3, t1)
u(t2, t1)u(t2, t1) = i

causality tells us that things happen in chronological order: each event is determined
by those immediately preceding. it is a kind of group property; in particular, from
considering t3 = t2 we nd that

we can then write

u(t, t) = i

u(t + , t)  i  ih(t)

by expanding in , for some operator h(t) that we call the hamiltonian. again
applying causality, we nd

tu(t, t) = lim

(cid:19) u(t, t) = ih(t)u(t, t)

u(t + , t)  u(t, t)
u(t + , t)  i





a. general

275

which is the schrodinger equation for u. again applying causality to build up the
nite u from products of the innitesimal ones,

u(tf , ti) = eih(tf)    eih(ti+)eih(ti)  t (cid:26)exp(cid:20)iz tf

ti

dt h(t)(cid:21)(cid:27)

which denes the time-ordered product t . finally, unitarity, another group prop-
erty, tells us that probability is conserved; in particular, from applying to u(t + , t),

h(t) = h(t)

the expression of u in terms of a hermitian hamiltonian guarantees causality and
unitarity. (it solves those conditions.) if h is time independent and we have a
(orthonormal) basis of eigenstates of h, we can write

h|ii = ei|ii  u(t, t) =xi

|iihi|ei(tt)ei

in feynmans path integral approach to quantum mechanics (based on an analogy
of dirac), the action is the starting point for quantization. the basic idea is to begin
with the basic quantity in quantum mechanics, the transition amplitude, and write
it as an integral of the action

hf|ii =z d eis[]

where r d is a functional integral:

integrate over (t) for each t (with some
appropriate normalization). the boundary conditions in t are dened by the choice
of initial and nal states. in this subsection we will dene this integral in a more
explicit way by breaking up the time interval into discrete points and taking the
continuum limit; in the next subsection we will study ways to evaluate it using its
general properties.

the path integral can be derived from the usual hamiltonian operator formal-
ism. considering for simplicity a single coordinate q, the wave function is given in
coordinate space by

(q) = hq|i,

(q)|qi

for coordinate and momentum space. to describe time development, we work in

between the time-independent states |i and time-dependent operators q(t)
of the heisenberg picture and the time-dependent states |(t)i and time-
independent operators q of the schrodinger picture, dene time-dependent
eigenstates in two ways:

q|qi = q|qi  (cid:26)

hq(t)|(t)i  hq|i

(q, t)  hq|(t)i  hq, t|i

given the time development of a state

|(t)i = u(t)|i

(u(t)  u(t, 0)), nd the development of q(t), |q(t)i, and |q, ti, and show in
particular that |q(t)i 6= |q, ti. which is the eigenstate of q(t)?

in general, even for time-dependent hamiltonians, we can nd the innitesimal
time development explicitly from the denition of the time derivative and the time-
dependent schrodinger equation:

[it  h(iq, q, t)]hq, t| = 0

 hq, t + | = hq, t|{1  ih[p (t), q(t), t]}  hq, t|eih[p (t),q(t),t]

and similarly for hp, t + | (where p and q are the hilbert-space operators). to
derive the path-integral formalism, we then iterate this result to obtain nite time
development by inserting unity innitely many times, alternating between coordinate
and momentum,

where the time dependence follows from the previous equation. however, note that
all the implicit time dependence of the heisenberg picture drops out, because we
extracted the eihs, putting all the factors of each matrix element at the same
time: although each matrix element is evaluated at time  earlier than the one to its
immediate left, each is of the form

ha, t + |b, ti = ha, t|eih[p (t),q(t),t]|b, ti = ha|eih[p,q,t]|bi

(where |bi  |b, tii, etc.), leaving only any explicit time dependence that may appear
in the hamiltonian, eectively translating the other ts  ti. then we only need to
know

hp|qi = eipq
to evaluate the matrix elements in the path integral as

hq|pi = eipq,

...

exp{i[qip0 + h(p0, qi, ti)  q1p0 + h(p0, q1, ti + ) + q1p1 + h(p1, q1, ti + 2) + ...]}

note that by adding (or subtracting) a step or two we could just as well evaluate
hqf , tf|pi, tii or hpf , tf|qi, tii or hpf , tf|pi, tii.

the classical picture is a segmented path, with the particle traveling along a
straight line segment from point qn to point qn+1 with momentum pn: each q is
associated with a point, while each p is associated with the line segment connecting
two consecutive points. in the continuum limit   0, n  , tf  ti xed,

(we have dropped some terms in hq|h|pi and hp|h|qi from reordering the operators
q and p in h(p, q) to apply p|pi = p|pi and q|qi = q|qi. these commutator terms
alternate in sign, combining to give terms of order 2, and can be dropped in the

continuum limit.)

more generally, we can evaluate an arbitrary transition amplitude as

a = hf|ii =z dqf2

dqi2

f *(qf )hqf , tf|qi, tiii(qi) =z dp dq f *(qf )eisi(qi)

where now

dp dq =

n1yn=0

dqn2

nyn=0

note that we can combine the initial and nal wave function, as

 (qi, qf )  f *(qf )i(qi)  a =z dp dq  (qi, qf )eis

the complex conjugation of f vs. i is due to the complex conjugation involved in
time reversal (as seen, e.g., when comparing an eigenstate of p at the inital time to

the same eigenstate at the nal time). in eld theory, where the ps and qs are

functions of space as well as time, if we choose the boundary in space also to be nite,

so that the space and time boundaries form a single connected and closed boundary,

then  is simply a function of the qs over all that boundary.

we now see the relationship of the path integral approach to the time development

operator: from the above derivation of the path integral, by integrating back out the

insertions of unity immediately after extracting the innitesimal exponentials and

translating the time of each matrix element to zero, we nd

hq, tf|q, tii = hqf|u(tf , ti)|qii

u(tf , ti) = eih(tf)    eih(ti+)eih(ti) = t (cid:26)exp(cid:20)iz tf

dt h(t)(cid:21)(cid:27)

as previously. this is eectively a schrodinger-picture expression (all the p s and qs

are at the initial time), and can also be derived in that picture by solving for the time
dependence of any state |(t)i.

2. semiclassical expansion

the path integral formulation is especially suited for semiclassical approxima-
tions: the bohr-sommerfeld quantization rule follows from the fact that the func-
tional integral is invariant under s  s + 2n, since s appears only as eis; in that
sense the action is more like an angle than a single-valued function. the jwkb ex-
pansion follows from s  s/h and expanding in h. this expansion can be interpreted
as an expansion in (space and time) derivatives, since it leads in the usual way to the
identication p = ih/x and e = ih/t.

exercise va2.1

for comparison, we review the schrodinger equation approach. consider the
nonrelativistic jwkb expansion for the propagator (for an arbitrary hamil-
tonian h) to the rst two orders in h, writing it as

g  eis/h

a show the corresponding orders in the time-dependent schrodinger equation
at t > 0 can be written as the classical equation of motion for the action s
and the (probability) current conservation law for the (probability) density 
(hamilton-jacobi equations),

b the propagator is expressed in terms of q and q0, where g(q, q0, t)  (q q0)
at t = 0, so the rst order in h is found by using the solution to the hamilton-
jacobi equations to write the classical action in terms of the nal position
q and initial position q0. (in principle; in general even the classical equations
may be too dicult to solve analytically.) however, the hamiltonian is given
as a function of p and q. show that the change in variables from q, p to q, q0

v. quantization

(the van vleck determinant) solves the current conservation law, using the
explicit expression for (det m)m1 given in subsection ib3. check the nor-
malization, using the initial condition for propagators (or comparing to the
free case).

one way to apply the path integral is as follows: (1) find a classical solution to
the equations of motion. this gives the leading contribution in h (stationary phase
approximation),

z d eis/h  eis0/h

(the validity of such an approximation with an imaginary exponent will be discussed
in subsection va5.)

(2) expand about the classical solution as

 = cl + h

expanding in  (or h), we have schematically

h1s = h1s0 + h1/2s0 + 1

2 s0 ()2 + h1/2 1

6 s0 ()3 + ...

where 0 means to evaluate at  = cl and the derivatives are really functional
derivatives (so there is also an integral for each derivative). the rst term in the action
gives the classical contribution, while the linear term vanishes by the equations of
motion. the quadratic term gives an h-independent contribution to the exponential,
so the next order approximation to the functional integral comes from integrating
just that: integrating gaussians as in subsection ib3,

z d eis/h  eis0/h(det s0 )1/2

where the determinant is now a functional one, which can be dened by performing
the functional integral as in the previous section, as a series of ordinary gaussian
integrals. the boundary conditions are  = 0 at ti and tf (since cl =  there).
normalization constants can be determined by comparing the free case, or considering
the limit where the initial and nal times converge.

(3) we then expand the exponential in the cubic and higher terms (positive powers
of h): the resulting functional integral is that of an h-independent gaussian times a
polynomial with positive powers of h. since odd orders in  vanish by symmetry
(  ), only integer powers of h appear:

z d eis/h = eis0/hz d()eis

0 ()2/2 1 +

hnfn[]!

xn=1

a. general

polynomials times gaussians are also straightforward to integrate: the easiest way
is to rst evaluate integrals of gaussians with linear terms:

z
ddx
(2)d/2 ext sx/2+jt x = (det s)1/2ejt s1j/2
z ddz* ddz

(2i)d ezhz+zj+jz = (det h)1ejh 1j

from shifting the integration variables (x  x + s1j, etc.) to eliminate the linear
terms, then using the previous results. in functions of x multiplying the gaussian, x
can be replaced with /j (and similarly for z) and then pulled outside the integral.
(if a linear term is not included, it can be introduced, and the result can be evaluated
at j = 0.) the nal result then takes the form

hqf , tf|qi, tii = eis0/h(a + hb + ...) = exp i 1

as an example, consider the free nonrelativistic particle. the separability of the
action translates into factorization of the functional integral, so the result can be
found from the one-dimensional case. as usual,

l =  1

2 m

.
x2  xcl(t) = xi +

xf  xi

(t  ti)

where we have written the classical solution in terms of the variables appropriate to
the initial and nal states, namely xi for an initial state localized there at time ti,
and xf , tf for the nal state. since the classical action is itself quadratic, so is its
expansion:

s = scl + s,

scl =  1

2 m

(xf  xi)2
tf  ti

s = z dt 1

2 m(

in general, a determinant from the s integral must be evaluated (but see exercise
va2.1). in this simple case, time translation invariance, dimensional analysis, and
independence from xf , xi are enough to determine the result of that functional integral

282

v. quantization

up to a constant, xed by the short-time limit tf  ti. the nal one-dimensional
result is then

hxf , tf|xi, tii =s im
tf  ti
2(x) = lim
0

where we have used

1 ex2/2
(one way of dening a dirac  function) to normalize

eim(xfxi)2/2(tfti)

hxf , t|xi, ti = 2(xf  xi)

the gaussian integral for the free particle can also be performed explicitly, by

using the discretized hamiltonian path integral of the previous subsection.

exercise va2.3

the path integral for the free, nonrelativistic particle can be evaluated much
more easily using the hamiltonian form of the action. first consider the
gaussian integral

as a special case of the gaussians already evaluated, and use it to derive the
identity



z 
z 



dx eipxx2/2

dx eipx = 2(p)

(the  thus acts as a regulator to make the integral well dened.) then use
the discretized expression of subsection va1, and evaluate the x integrals
rst. all but one of the p integrals then can be trivially evaluated, the last
giving a fourier transform.

exercise va2.4

consider the one-dimensional harmonic oscillator. (the multi-dimesional case
is again separable.)

a explicitly evaluate the discretized path integral to nd the result

hxf , ti + t|xi, tii =rim

sin t

exp( im[ 1

2(x2

f + x2

i )cos t  xf xi]
sin t

)

b rederive the result using the result of exercise va2.1. (hint: first solve the
classical equations of motion for x(t), then rewrite it in terms of xi = q0 and
xf = q; plug into scl = s and apply the above.)

note that we have been sloppy about the denition of the integration measure:
in going from the hamiltonian form of the action to the lagrangian form, we ignored

a. general

283

some m dependence. specically, if we start with the hamiltonian form, as derived
in the previous subsection, and derive the lagrangian form by integrating out p, we
nd the 1/m in h = p2/2m leads to

dpn2

n1yn=0

n1yn=1

dxn2  mn/2

dxn2

n1yn=1

the m(n1)/2 then cancels similar factors from the n  1 x-integrals, while the re-
maining m is that found in the nal result above.

if we had considered a more general hamiltonian, as in subsection iiia1, where
2gij(x)pipj, then we would have obtained a measure of the form (for

p2 appeared as 1
i = 1, ..., d)

[det g(x0)det g(xn )]1/4

n1yn=1

ddxn

(2)d/2pdet g(xn)

(we have averaged g as g(x)p2 pg(xn)g(xn+1)p2

n, since xn is associated with the
point n while pn is associated with the link from n to n+ 1.) such measure factors are
easy to recognize, since they are always local, without any derivatives: if we included
it in the action, it would be a term proportional to

ln yn

det g(xn) = 1

 ln det g(xn)  (0)z dt ln det g(x(t))

xn

(the factors at x0 and xn are for standard normalization of the wave functions, which
we can absorb by a redenition.) in practice we just drop all such factors throughout
the calculation, and x the normalization at the end of the calculation. since the
lagrangian form follows from the hamiltonian form, which was properly normalized,
we know such factors will cancel anyway. auxiliary elds can require similar factors
for proper normalization; then such factors are simply the jacobians from the eld
redenitions from a form where they appeared with trivial quadratic terms.

3. propagators

the amplitude we dened by path integration in subsection va1 is the propa-

gator or green function for the schrodinger equation. explicitly, we dene

g(q, t; q, t)  (t  t)hq, t|q, ti

where we have included the step function (t  t) (1 for t > t, 0 otherwise) to
enforce that the nal time is later than the initial time (retarded propagator). this
satises the free case of the general dening equation of the propagator

[t + ih(iq, q, t)]g(q, t; q, t) = [t + ih(iq, q, t)]g(q, t; q, t)

284

v. quantization

where we have used

= 2(q  q)(t  t)

t(t  t) = (t  t)

and the facts that g without the  factor is a homogeneous solution of the schrodinger
equation (no s) and becomes a  in x for small times. the propagator then gives a
general solution of the schrodinger equation as

hq, t| =z dq

2 hq, t|q, tihq, t|  (q, t) =z dq

2

g(q, t; q, t)(q, t)

in particular, for (q, t) = 2(q  q) at some time t for some point q, (q, t) =

g(q, t; q, t) at all later times. these equations are matrix elements of the correspond-
ing operator equations; e.g.,

g(q, t; q, t)  hq|u(t, t)|qi

[t + ih(t)]u(t, t) = u(t, t)[


 t + ih(t)] = (t  t)i

where we now include a step function in the denition of the time development oper-
ator u:

u(t, t)  (t  t)t (cid:26)exp(cid:20)iz t

t

dt h(t)(cid:21)(cid:27)

this solution for the propagator is not unique; as usual, a rst-order dierential
equation needs one boundary condition. another way to say it is that the inhomoge-
neous dierential equation is arbitrary up to a solution of the homogeneous equation.
we have eliminated the ambiguity by requiring that the propagator be retarded, as
incorporated in the factor (t  t); using instead (t  t) would give the advanced
propagator.

this has an interesting translation in terms of the fourier transform with respect
to the time, which replaces the so-called time-dependent schrodinger equation with
the time-independent one. fourier transforms are a useful way to solve dieren-
tial equations when performed with respect to variables with translational invari-
ance, since this implies conservation of the conjugate variable: the result is elimi-
nation of the corresponding derivatives. in this case, it means the time-independent
schrodinger equation needs a time-independent hamiltonian. for example, dening

we have an ambiguity in integrating e past the pole at e = h. we therefore shift
the pole slightly o the real axis, so we can integrate exactly on the real axis. closing
the contour by adding to the real axis a semicircle of innite radius in either the
complex upper- or lower-half-plane, wherever convergent (lim|t| e|et| = 0, but
lim|t| e+|et| = ), we nd

z de

2

eiet

e  h  i

which gives either the retarded or advanced propagator depending on the choice of sign
for the innitesimal constant  (retarded for e  h + i). remember from exercise

charges: the general integral result we used is

i dz

2i

where the counterclockwise contour of integration encloses the pole at z but no sin-
gularity in f , so we can evaluate the integral by taylor expanding f about z.

b show that this is the contour integral denition of the  function, which is
actually a distribution, by integration, multiplying by an arbitrary (nonsin-
gular) function and integrating along the real axis. (hint: push the poles
onto the real axis, shifting the contours along with them, to nd the integral
of a single function along the dierence of two contours.)

g(x, t; x, t) = (t  t)r im

however, we could have saved the trouble if we just started in momentum space,

g(p, t; p, t)  hp|u(t, t)|pi = hp|(t  t)ei(tt)h|pi = (t  t)ei(tt)p2/2mhp|pi

= (t  t)2(p  p)ei(tt)p2/2m

in the retarded case. if we fourier transform p to x (the same as a change of basis
from |pi to |xi), the integrals are then simple gaussians. again, the result is simpler
in p-space because p is conserved. in the relativistic case we will want to treat energy
and momentum equally; doing the same here for later comparison, we dene

and similarly for g, and we have

4. s-matrices

scattering is dened as a process that starts with a free state and ends with
a free state, with interaction (self- or with external forces) at intermediate times,
e.g., particles coming in from and going out to spatial innity and scattering from a

a. general

287

potential of nite spatial extent. thus, if the interaction is nonvanishing somewhere
between times t1 and t2, where tf > t2 > t1 > ti, we can write

u(tf , ti) = u(tf , t2)u(t2, t1)u(t1, ti) = ei(tft2)h0u(t2, t1)ei(t1ti)h0

in terms of the free term h0 of the hamiltonian h = h0 + hi, where hi is the
interaction term. (hi may be time dependent, but not h0.) it is more convenient
to work with a quantity that is independent of initial and nal times (as long as they
are outside of the interaction region t1 to t2). we therefore dene the s(cattering)-
matrix operator s as

s  lim

ti
tf +

eitf h0u(tf , ti)eitih0

where we have thrown in the limit because in the real world interaction doesnt just
start and stop, but fades in and out. however, in our simple example above we nd

s = eit2h0u(t2, t1)eit1h0

in the interacting case, the amplitude we get from the path integral is the inter-
acting propagator. to be able to take the limit describing time development between
innite initial and nal times, we need to choose boundary conditions such that the
initial and nal basis states have the time dependence of free particles, described
by h0, assuming that the particle behaves freely at such asymptotically large times.
this is called the interaction picture, to distinguish from the heisenberg picture,
where the states have no time dependence, and the schrodinger picture, where the
states have the complete interacting time dependence. we thus evaluate the limiting
amplitude

a = lim

tf +hf (tf )|i(ti)i = lim

ti

tf +z dqf2

dqi2

f *(qf , tf )hqf , tf|qi, tiii(qi, ti)

for the interaction-picture states |(t)i, relating the interaction-picture coordinate
basis 0hq, t| to the heisenberg-picture basis hq, t| (with initial conditions 0hq, 0| =
hq, 0|  hq|):

0hq, t| = hq|eith0  hqf , tf|qi, tii = 0hqf , tf|eitf h0u(tf , ti)eitih0|qi, tii0

(q, t) = 0hq, t|i  a = hf|s|ii

with s as dened above.

the fact that time development conserves probability (h = h) is reected in

the corresponding unitarity condition for the s-matrix:

ss = 1

288

v. quantization

a more complicated condition is causality: the basic idea is that interactions take
place in chronological order. (a stronger statement of causality will be found in the
relativistic case: that any interaction should take place at a spacetime point, rather
than just at a single time.
it follows from this weaker one in relativistic theories,
since event b is later than event a in every lorentz frame only when b is in as
lightcone.) causality is the condition that the hamiltonian at any time involves only
variables evaluated at that time. (h(t) is a function of only (t), all at the same
time t, where  = p, q are the quantum variables appearing in the hamiltonian.) a
nice way to describe the interactions is by introducing a classical background as we
did for the semiclassical expansion of path integrals, such as by (t)  (t) + (t),
where  is just some function. the important point is that we have shifted (t) by
(t) at the same t, so as not to disturb causality. we then consider the eect on the
s-matrix of modifying the background  by a function  localized (nonvanishing) at
some particular time t, and a function  localized at t, such that t > t. picking
out the  pieces in the time-ordered product, we can therefore write

s[ +  + ] = u(f, t)v(t)u(t, t)v(t)u(t, i)

s[ + ] = u(f, t)v(t)u(t, t)u(t, i)
s[ + ] = u(f, t)u(t, t)v(t)u(t, i)

s[] = u(f, t)u(t, t)u(t, i)

where u(t, i) is the time-development operator from time ti to time t (including the
canceling factor with h0), v(t) is the extra factor in the time development at time
t resulting from the function  localized there, etc. thus we replace a v with the
identity if the corresponding  is absent. then we easily nd

s[ +  + ] = s[ + ]s1[]s[ + ]

 (s1[ + ]s[ +  + ]  i)  (s1[]s[ + ]  i) = 0



(t)(cid:18)s[]



(t)s[](cid:19) = 0



f or t > t

using the innitesimal functions  and  to dene functional derivatives (as in
subsection iiia1 for the action).

in general, it is not possible to solve the schrodinger equation for the propagator
or the s-matrix exactly. one approximation scheme is the perturbation expansion in
orders of the interaction:

h = h0 + v  t (eir dt h) = ei(tfti)h0 +z tf

dt ei(tft)h0[iv (t)]ei(tti)h0
dt ei(tft)h0[iv (t)]ei(tt)h0[iv (t)]ei(tti)h0 + ...

dt hf, t|[iv (t)]|i, ti

dt hf, t|[iv (t)]ei(tt)h0[iv (t)]|i, ti + ...

the rst term in s is just the identity (i.e., the free piece). all the other terms
consist of a string of interactions (iv ) connected by free propagators (eith0, where
t is the time between the interactions), with each interaction integrated over all
time (subject to time-ordering of the interactions), and the initial/nal state (wave
function) evaluated at the initial/nal interaction time.

exercise va4.1

assume the initial and nal states are eigenstates of the free hamiltonian:

h0|ii = ei|ii,

h0|fi = ef|fi

assuming v has no explicit time dependence, explicitly evaluate the time
integrals in the s-matrix, eectively fourier transforming from time to energy,
to nd

sf i = hf|ii  2i(ef  ei)hf|(e  h0)

e  h + i

(e  h0)|ii|e=ei

(hints: redene the integration variables to be the times between interac-
tions. taylor expand 1/(e  h + i) in v for comparison.)

in eld theory we want to express any state in terms of a basis of products of
1-particle states, so we can calculate the behavior of these specied particles. we
try to do this by using eld variables (the qs of eld theory): each eld operator
should produce a single particle. unfortunately, this is not the case: an asymptotic
state of given 3-momentum created by such a eld operator is not necessarily an
eigenstate of the energy, because such a state can be either 1-particle or n-particle,
due to interactions. the propagator for the eld is then of the form

g(p, t; p, t)  (p  p)xi

*i(p)i(p)ei(tt)ei (p)

ei(p) =

ei,i(pi),

pi = p

nixi=1

nixi=1

where ei,i(pi) is the energy of a 1-particle state (thepi will include an integral in

general). however, as long as all particles have masses, such an asymptotic 1-particle
state is distinguishable as that of lowest energy e0: the higher-energy states are
n-particle states to which this particle can couple. (if some of the n-particle states

290

v. quantization

were lower energy, the 1-particle state could decay into them, and thus the 1-particle
state would be unstable, and not asymptotic. with massless particles things are more
complicated: then 1-particle states are more dicult to dene and to measure.) in
principle, we could dene the 1-particle states by constructing the corresponding
operator, consisting of the eld plus terms higher order in the elds; in practice, this
is rather complicated.

a simpler way to make the asymptotic states unambiguous is by modifying the

denition of the s-matrix:

s =

lim

ti(1+i)
tf +(1+i)

eitf h0 t (cid:18)eir tf

ti

dt h(cid:19) eitih0

introducing factors of 1 + i for some positive , which may be chosen small for
convenience. (actually, we can generally replace 1 + i with just i if it is not too
confusing: the result is the same.) the eect is seen by considering a matrix element
of particular elds that may be a superposition of dierent energies e in the initial
state and e in the nal state, but evaluated between an initial state of energy ei and
a nal state of energy ef (which might not be equal for a time-dependent interaction,
e.g., if the number of particles changes). since e  ei initially and e  ef nally,
the time dependence of any such matrix element is proportional to

sf i 

lim

tf+(1+i)

eitf (eef )

lim

ti(1+i)

eiti(eei) =(cid:26) 1 f or e = ei, e = ef

0 otherwise

alternatively, we can simply impose e = ei, e = ef directly in the denition:

s = lim

ti
tf +

eitf h0h(tf ),h0 t (cid:18)eir tf

ti

dt h(t)(cid:19) h(ti),h0eitih0

where the free schrodinger equation h0 = ei or ef denes ei for the initial state
and ef for the nal state, and h,h0 is evaluated by examining the asymptotic time-
dependence of the time-development operator with respect to ti and tf : normally
eld theory is calculated in energy-momentum space, working with the spacetime
fourier transform of the above, where this amounts to simply comparing energies
e = ei, e = ef .

if we know some details of the interaction, this modication may be irrelevant: in
particular, in local quantum eld theory interactions happen at a point in space and
time. for example, consider the inner product between a 1-particle state in its rest
frame and a related n-particle state, which appears in the same propagator. because
of locality, the wave function for the n-particle state, when evaluated in position space

a. general

291

(which is where the theory is local) is simply the product of n 1-particle wave functions
evaluated at the same point. but we know that for small relative momenta (where a
nonrelativistic approximation holds) that the individual wave functions propagate as

||  |t  t|(d1)/2

from the form of the free 1-particle propagator. (or, we can use dimensional analysis,
and consider the spread of a particle of restricted range of momenta from a conned
region: then ||2  1/v and the volume v  |t  t|d1.) this implies that the
n-particle wave function will fall o as the nth power of that, so in the limit of large
times the 1-particle state will dominate.
in a relativistic theory the length scale
associated with this fall-o will be associated with the masses involved, and thus at
a subatomic scale.

5. wick rotation

in the previous subsection we ensured convergence in the denition of the s-matrix

by eectively making the coordinate change

t  (1  i)t = eit

in the denition of the limit

(1  i)t    t  (1 + i)

this aected the time-development operator as

eiht  eihtt

for h > 0 to pick out the ground state h = 0. the same eective substitution was
made in subsection va3 in dening the contour integral for the propagator:

eie(1i)t

z de
=z de

i

e  h

i

eiet

2

=z de

2

i

(1 + i)e  h
eiet

i

e  h + i

which is the same as the substitution

e  (1 + i)e = eie

(when working with the time-independent schrodinger equation) since essentially
e = i/t.

292

v. quantization

in general, having to do contour integrals and keep track of is in propagators is
inconvenient. fortunately, there is a simple way in practical calculations to get rid
of not only the is but (almost) all the other is as well. the method is known as
wick rotation. the basic idea is to extend the above complex rotation from angle
 to angle /2:

t  it = ei/2t,

e  ie

pushing the contour even farther away from the singularities. thus, the schrodinger
equation is changed to a diusion equation (to describe, e.g., brownian motion):

(it  h) = 0  (t + h) = 0

for example, for the free particle the resulting equation has no is. the time-
independent schrodinger equation then becomes

(e  h) = 0  (ie  h) = 0

the result for the propagator is then

z 



de
2

eiet

h  ie

= (t)eht

now no i prescription is needed, since the pole was moved away from the real axis.
similar remarks apply to the inverse fourier transform

exercise va5.1

find the wick-rotated retarded propagator g(x, t; x, t) for the free (1d)
particle, satisfying

(t + h)g = (t + h)g = 2(x  x)(t  t)

furthermore, if we dene the s-matrix directly in this wick-rotated space

s = lim

ti
tf +

etf h0 t (cid:18)er tf

ti

dt h(cid:19) etih0

then the limiting procedure is unambiguous even in eld theory, since

etf (eef ) =(cid:26) 1 f or e = ef

0 f or e > ef

0 f or e > ei

another important eect is on actions. for example, in the mechanics path
.
x2 in a potential u(x), we integrated

integral for a particle with kinetic term t = 1

2m

eis :

upon wick rotation, this becomes

es :

s =z dt(u  t )
s =z dt(u + t )

the major change on the exponent s is that it is now not only real, but negative
denite. (for physical purposes, we assume the potential has a lower bound, which
can be dened to be nonnegative without loss of generality.) thus, the semiclassical
approximation we made earlier, called the stationary phase approximation, has now
become the steepest descent approximation, namely tting es/h to a gaussian,
which is approximating the integral by the places where the integrand is largest. we
thus write

s(x) = s(x0) + 1

2(x  x0)2s(x0) + ...,

s(x0) = 0, s(x0) > 0

for one variable, with the obvious generalization to many variables. explictly, we
then have

z

dx
2h

es(x)/h 

1

ps(x)

es(x)/h(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)s(x)=0

plus higher orders in h, expressed in terms of higher derivatives of s. in the case
of many variables, s is replaced with a determinant, as for the gaussian integrals
of subsection ib3, and for functional integrals, with a functional determinant. (but
sometimes the functional determinant can be replaced with an ordinary determinant:
see exercise va2.4.)

so now we can rst calculate everything in wick-rotated spacetime, where every-
thing is real (more precisely, classical reality properties are preserved quantum me-
chanically), and then wick rotate back to nd the correct result in physical spacetime.
in particular, the appropriate s, still needed to correctly position the singularities
in physical spacetime, can be restored by rotating back through an angle 1

classically we distinguish between particles and waves. this can be consistent
with a classical limit of a quantum theory if there is a conserved charge associated
with the classical particles, with respect to which the classical waves are neutral. such
a situation is described by a eld theory lagrangian (density) of the form

l = o() + l()

where  is te eld of the charged particle, and  the eld of the waves that carry the
interaction. o includes the kinetic operator; a nonrelativistic example was given in
subsection iiia3. thus o() = 0, the eld equation for , is also a schrodinger
equation, which we can derive from a classical mechanics action. (a zero-range inter-
action, as in billiard-ball collisions, is described by an l without derivatives.) then
we can have continuous worldlines for the particles: the statement that the worldlines
do not end or split is associated with charge conservation. the interaction between
the particles and waves is described by  dependence in the particle (mechanics) ac-
tion obtained from o (and not the term l for the wave elds). if we look at just
the mechanics action, the modication is the same as considering external elds (like
external potentials in nonrelativistic mechanics), since we are ignoring l, which is
needed for the eld equations of .

l then can be added separately. coupling to such external elds is a simple
way to study properties of particles without applying eld theory. for example, in
nonrelativistic mechanics it helps to explain charge and spin, which dont appear
explicitly in the free schrodinger equation.

1. particles

all the information in quantum mechanics is contained in the propagator, which
gives the general solution to the schrodinger equation, and can be obtained by the
feynman path integral. here we discuss the free propagator for the spinless particle
(whose classical description was given in section iiib), which is the starting point for
relativistic perturbation theory.

we consider quantization rst in the lorentz covariant gauge v = 1. from sub-

section iiib2 we have

sh,ap =z t

0

d [ .

xmpm + 1

2(p2 + m2)]

296

v. quantization

except for the t integration in the functional integral (in addition to the functional
integration over x and p), the same methods can be applied as in the nonrelativistic
case, where we had

sh,n r =z 



dt( .

xipi + 1

2m p2)

the simplest expression (and ultimately the most useful one) is obtained by fourier
transforming with respect to x: in comparison to the multidimensional nonrelativistic
result

gn r(pi, t; pi, t) = (p  p)(t  t)ei(tt)p2/2m

(where here (p  p) = (2)(d1)/2d1(pi  pi) for d  1 spatial dimensions), the
relativistic result is

g(p, p) =z dt (p  p)(t )eit (p2+m2)/2

(where now (p  p) = (2)d/2d(pa  pa) for d spacetime dimensions).

there are several simple yet important dierences from the nonrelativistic case:

(1) the dependence on the mass m is dierent. in particular, we can set m = 0 only

in the relativistic case.

(2) there is an additional integration r dt , because the variable t , which is the

remaining part of v, survives the gauge v = 1.
(it is all that remains of a
would-be functional integral over v.) this is analogous to the time integral in
the nonrelativistic case for g(pi, e; pi, e), if we set the energy to zero. this
is as expected, since the relativistic classical mechanics diers from the nonrel-
ativistic one mainly by constraining the hamiltonian 1
2(p2 + m2) to vanish.
this interpretation also leads to the zero-energy version of the inhomogeneous
(proper-)time-independent schrodinger equation for this case,

i 1

2 (  m2)g(x, x) = (x  x)

(3) the propagator is automatically retarded in the proper time t , as a conse-
quence of the positivity condition v > 0, which was motivated by the geometrical
interpretation of v as the worldline metric.

when used in this manner to write the propagator in terms of a gaussian, t is known
as a schwinger parameter.

generally, it is convenient to remove the momentum -function (which resulted

from translational invariance) as

g(x, x) = (x  x)  g(p, p) = (p  p)(p)

b. propagators

297

(p) =z dt (t )eit (p2+m2)/2

where we have simply written (p) for the fourier transform of (x) (dropping the

tilde). performing the t integral, using the same methods as for the t integral in the

nonrelativistic case, we have the nal result

(p) =

i

1

2(p2 + m2  i)

actually, this result is almost obvious from solving the relativistic wave equation. the

only part that is not obvious is the i prescription: how to perform the contour

integration upon fourier transformation.

in the nonrelativistic case, we saw two

obvious choices, corresponding to retarded or advanced propagators; the classical

action did not distinguish between the two, although the retarded propagator has the

obvious convenience of determining later events from earlier ones. on the other hand,

in the relativistic case the choice of propagator was xed from classical considerations.

t is restricted to be positive, and the i is needed to make the t integral converge.

exercise vb1.1

take the nonrelativistic limit of the relativistic propagator, and compare with

the propagator of nonrelativistic quantum mechanics. explain the dierence

in terms of the nonrelativistic limit of the classical mechanics action.

exercise vb1.2

perform the analysis of exercise va2.2 for the relativistic particle. first re-

place the integration over t by a sum: instead of dividing up the time into
2n intervals of length  and taking the limit n  ,   0, with 2n xed,

sum 2pn =0, and then take the limit   0. (2n is now t instead of tf  ti,

and we integrate over it instead of keeping it xed.) perform all x integrals

and then all but the last p integral before summing over n. again, the entire

calculation is much easier than using the lagrangian (second-order) form of

the path integral.

to understand this point better, we examine the fourier transformation with

respect to time. in contrast to the nonrelativistic case, there are now two poles, at

p0 = ,  =p(pi)2 + m2 :

 =

i

(cid:18)

1

p0  (  i) 

1

p0 + (  i)(cid:19)

where now pa = (p0, pi). these are also the two classical values of the canonical energy
(as opposed to the true energy, which is the absolute value), which we saw previously

298

v. quantization

corresponded to particles and antiparticles. with our prescription for integrating
around the poles, using the same methods as in the nonrelativistic case, we then nd

g(pi, t; pi, t) = (2)d/2d1(pi  pi)

ei|tt|

[(t  t)ei(tt) + (t  t)ei(tt)]

we now see that the particles (p0 = ) have a retarded propagator, while the antipar-
ticles (p0 = ) have an advanced propagator. this is the quantum version of the
classical result we saw earlier, that particles travel forward in time, while antiparticles
travel backward. the interpretation is simple: when evaluating matrix elements of
the form hf|o|ii, the resulting propagator ensures that the initial wave function con-
tains only positive energies, while the nal complex conjugate wave function contains
only negative energies (i.e., the nal wave function itself contains positive energies).

we next compare quantization in the lightcone gauge. again from subsection

iiib2,

sh,lc =z 



d [

whereas in the covariant gauge the analog to the nonrelativistic time t was the
proper time t , the analog is now the lightcone time  . since  = x+/p+, we
have e = pp+ (e = i/ vs. p = i/x+), and thus

(p) =

e  1

2(pi2 + m2) + i

as before. note that this derivation was almost identical to the nonrelativistic one:
unlike the covariant gauge, we did not have to add in t as a separate variable of
integration (but not path integration). however, this schwinger parameter is useful
for evaluating momentum integrals and analyzing momentum dependence. this is a
typical characteristic of unitary gauges: they are more useful for keeping track of
degrees of freedom.

2. properties

as in electrodynamics, the free scalar satises a dierential equation second-order
in time, so the propagator is used dierently from nonrelativistic quantum mechanics
to give a general solution to the wave equation. we begin by considering a free
action between two dierent scalar elds, written in a way where all derivatives act
on just one eld or just the other, i.e., where the eld equation is explicit. the two
forms are related by integration by parts, but now we keep boundary terms:

z ddx [a(  m2)b  b(  m2)a] =z ddx   (a



 b) =i dd1m a


 mb

b. propagators

299

where in the last step we have used the (generalized) stokes theorem (see subsection

ic2); h dd1m is the integral over the closed surface bounding the volume inte-
grated over inr ddx. in practice we take the volume to encompass all spacetime in

the limit, neglect the part of the boundary at spacelike innity, and choose the parts
of the boundary at timelike innity to be surfaces at constant time, so the boundary
integrals are over just space:

i dd1m a



 mb =z dd1x a

we then have the solution for the wave function inside the volume in terms of that
on the boundary:

where the (p0) appears because the contour integral gives a + at later times (positive
energy) and a  at earlier times (negative energy). explicitly, we nd for the inner
product of plane waves

p(x) = hx|pi = eipx

 hp|pi = (2)d/21d1(pi  pi)(p0) 1

2(p0 + p0)

we have used p2 + m2 = p2 + m2 = 0, which also implies that |p0| = |p0|: thus,
the inner product vanishes if the waves have opposite-sign energy, while for the same
sign (p0) 1
2(p0 + p0) = |p0|. the result then can be written manifestly covariantly as

hp|pi =

(p  p)

v. quantization

similarly, the solution for the wave function in terms of the green function gives
only positive-energy contributions from the part of the surface at earlier times, and
only negative-energy contributions from the part of the surface at later times. more
general on-shell wave functions, since they depend on only d  1 spatial momenta
and the sign of the energy, can be written as a restricted fourier transform

(x) =z dp 2[ 1

we have

it will prove useful later to have a collection of solutions to the homogeneous and
inhomogeneous klein-gordon equations, and compare them in 4-momentum space
and time-3-momentum space. using the previous nonrelativistic and relativistic re-
sults, we nd

well as the linear relations between the momentum-space expressions. in particular,
we see that + propagates just the positive-energy states, while  propagates just
the negative-energy ones.

exercise vb2.1

the relativistic propagator uses a particular choice for integrating around the
two poles in the complex energy plane, as encoded in the i prescription. if
we ignored the classical determination of that prescription, there would be
four simple choices, integrating either above or below the two poles.

b. propagators

301

a show these four choices can be enforced by replacing i in p2 + m2  i with

i, i,

ip0, ip0

and derive the results of the table above.

b give explicit expressions for the four propagators in position space in four

dimensions for the massless case.

we can check the propagators behavior by explicit evaluation, using plane waves:

 tp(x) = (p0) 1

ei|tt|ei~p~xip0t

= [p0(t  t)]p(x)

where we have used the previous result for g(~p, t; ~p, t) (and thus (~p, t)). again
we see that the propagator propagates positive-energy solutions forward in time and
negative-energy backward.

this propagator also applies to relativistic eld theory. (see subsection iiia3 for
nonrelativistic eld theory.) in comparison to the nonrelativistic case, the propagator
is now i/ 1
2m ~p 2  e), and this determines the kinetic term
in the eld theory action:

2(p2 + m2) instead of i/( 1

s0 = z dx 1

2 1

2(  m2) =z dx 1

4[()2 + m22]

to make the functional integral of eis0 converge, we replace m2  m2  i, which
is the same i prescription found in rst-quantization. note that we have used a real
eld * = . (a complex eld can be used by doubling  = (1 + i2)/2.) this is
possible only in the relativistic case because we have both positive-energy solutions
eiet as well as negative ones e+iet.
(in other words, the relativistic schrodinger
equation is a second-order dierential equation, so we get two is to make the kinetic
operator real.) reality simply means identifying particles with antiparticles. (e.g.,
there is no antiphoton distinct from the photon.)

equal-time hypersurfaces, we use m0 = m 0. there may be additional implicit
matrix factors in the lorentz-invariant inner product ab.) this in turn denes the
inner product

this inner product gives a nonnegative norm on physical bosonic states, but on physi-
cal fermionic states it is negative for negative energy, because ordering the initial state
to the left of the nal state (the wrong ordering for quantum mechanics) produces
a minus sign from the anticommutativity of the fermions. (from the explicit inte-
gral, this appears because k is generally second-order in derivatives for bosons, but
rst-order for fermions, so mm has one factor of p0 for bosons and none for fermions.)

for physical elds, the (free) eld equation will always imply the klein-gordon
equation (after gauge xing for gauge elds). thus, the propagator can always be
written as

 = 

i
k

n(p)

= i

1

2 (p2 + m2  i)

in terms of some matrix kinematic factor n(p). using this expression for the propa-
gator in our above position-space inner product, this implies (e.g., using g as in the
previous subsection for the denominator by using a fourier transform)

p(x) = (p)eipx  n(p)m0(p) (p) =  (p)

from integrating over a hypersurface at constant time. if we generalize to other at
hypersurfaces with timelike normals nm (e.g., by just lorentz transforming), we have

n(p)n  m(p) (p) = (p0)n  p (p)
and nally, by taking linear combinations for dierent ns,

n(p)mm(p) (p) = (p0)pm (p)

b. propagators

303

if we choose a basis that is orthonormalized with respect to all quantum numbers
other than momenta (i.e., with repsect to spin/helicity and internal symmetry), we
have

hp, i|p, ji = ij

(p  p)
2(p2 + m2)]

2[ 1

if we ignore coordinate/momentum dependence and focus on just these other quantum
numbers, then it is clear that

n = [(p0)]2sxi

|iihi|

where we have included an extra sign factor for negative energy and half-integer spin
from the reordering of states, as explained above.
in an arbitrary basis, we can
generalize to

n(p) = [(p0)]2sxi

i(p) i(p)

the positive-energy propagator is then given by a sum over all positive-energy states:

+ = n(p)(p0)2[ 1

2(p2 + m2)]

the fact that k is not simply the klein-gordon operator is a consequence of un-
physical (gauge/auxiliary) degrees of freedom appearing in the action: then n is a
projection operator that projects out the auxiliary degrees of freedom on shell, and
the gauge degrees of freedom on and o (in unitary gauges), as represented above
by a sum over physical states. however, more general ns are sometimes used that
include unphysical degrees of freedom; these must be canceled by ghosts, similar
unphysical degrees of freedom of the opposite statistics.

exercise vb3.2

use the construction of exercise vb1.2 to dene the path integral for the
spinning particle of exercise iiib1.2. show that in the covariant gauge v = 1,
 = constant, the propagator can be written as

(p) z d dt (t )et

=

i
  p

up to some arbitrary normalization factor, where  =r d  is the only gauge
invariant part of  (as t =r d v is for v).

we will nd that quantum corrections modify the form of the propagator.

in
particular, it may modify the position m2 of the pole in p2 and its residue, as well
as adding terms that are analytic near that pole. for example, consider a scalar
propagator of the form

(p) = i

n

1

2 (p2 + m2  i)

+ r

where n is a constant and r is analytic in p. by the procedure of renormalization,
n can be set to 1, and m2 can be set to its original value (see chapter vii). alter-
natively, we can cancel n in the normalization of external states, and redene the
masses of these states to coincide with what appears in the propagator.

exercise vb3.3

use this propagator to dene the inner product between two plane waves,
and evaluate it explicitly. show that r gives no contribution, and the plane
waves need factors of n to maintain their normalization. (hint: what is
the wave equation corresponding to , and how is it related to mm? you can
also consider the relation of n to +.)

away from the pole, at higher values of p2 than m2, there will also be cuts cor-
responding to mutiparticle states. although these higher-energy intermediate states
in the propagator will contribute to the time development even for on-shell states
(those satisfying p2 + m2 = 0 asymptotically), in s-matrix elements we can ignore
such contributions on external lines, using our modied denition for evaluating the
asymptotic limit for the s-matrix (see subsection va4).

which contains a pole at mass m and contributions from multiparticle states
at mass 2m and higher. fourier transform from energy to time. use this
propagator to dene the time development of a momentum eigenstate satis-
fying the free wave equation asymptotically, using the 1 + i prescription of
subsection va4 to dene the asymptotic limit:

and show that () does not contribute:

(  m2)0 = 0  (t) = 0(t)

4. wick rotation

as in the nonrelativistic case, the i prescription can also be xed by the innites-

imal wick rotation (see subsection va5)

t  (1  i)t, e  (1 + i)e

p2 + m2 

1

p2 + m2  i

however, in the relativistic case, a nite wick rotation gets rid of not only is but
also the annoying minus signs associated with the minkowski metric. we now replace
all timelike coordinates, including proper time, with spacelike coordinates:

in addition, for every vector eld v a we replace

t  it,

  i

v 0  iv 0

(v i  v i)

and similarly for tensor elds.
(here we have dened wick rotation in the rst-
quantized sense: on all explicit coordinates and momenta, as well as on explicit
lorentz indices. for example, in the eld theory action we rotate the explicit deriva-
tives and the integration measure, rather than the arguments of the elds.)

v. quantization

note that e as dened in the nonrelativistic case was p0, which is the same as

p0 only in minkowski space:

p0  ip0,

p0  +ip0

furthermore, there is some apparent ambiguity in how to change the integration
measure, corresponding to how the integration contours are rotated (i.e., changes
in the limits of integration).
in particular, we see from subsection va5 that the
contour rotation for e is actually in the opposite direction of that for t, consistent

p0, while dropping the 1 from p0  p0 because of the usual absolute value in the

with fourier transformation. (eectively, we keep the extra i forr dp from rotating
jacobian in real changes of variables.) the net result is the naive change for r dx,
while that forr dp preserves the inverse fourier transform:
z dx  iz dx,

z dp  iz dp;

(x)  i(x),

(p)  i(p)

when manipulating explicit expressions, the factors of i on coordinates/momenta
and elds can be transferred to the constant tensors contracting their indices: the
net eect is that the wick rotation is equivalent to changing just  , the integration
measures, the at-space metric, and the levi-civita tensor:

  i,


  i




z d  iz d,

z dx  iz dx,

z dp  iz dp

mn  mn,

abcd  iabcd

so now the inner product is positive denite: we have gone from minkowski space
to euclidean space.

for example, for the relativistic particle in the gauge v = 1, the propagator is

now

(p) =z dt (t )et (p2+m2)/2 =

1

1
2(p2 + m2)

the integral is automatically convergent because p2+m2 is now positive denite. if we
examine our transformation of timelike components in terms of the complex p0 plane,
we see that we have just rotated the contour from the real axis to the imaginary axis,
through an angle /2, which avoids the poles at p0 = (  i). (there is actually
a slight cheat in the massless case, since the two poles converge near vanishing 3-
momentum, where  = 0, but this problem can be avoided by an appropriate limiting
procedure.) note that in the relativistic case the euclidean propagator is completely

b. propagators

307

real also in momentum space; even the overall i has been killed. (compare the
nonrelativistic case in subsection va5, where i/(he)  1/(hie).) this follows
from rst wick rotating in position space, then performing the fourier transform as

usual (avoiding an extra i from rotating ther dt in the fourier transform).

exercise vb4.1

find the propagator in time-3-momentum space, g(pi, t; pi, t), after wick
rotation. (i.e., wick rotate (p) rst, then fourier transform.)

exercise vb4.2

find the massless propagator in 4d minkowski coordinate space, including
the i, by

a fourier transforming the schwinger-parametrized momentum-space propaga-

tor in minkowski space (including the minkowski  ),

b doing the same entirely in euclidean space, and then wick rotating the time

back to minkowski space, and

c fourier transforming both of the above cases without using the schwinger
parameter, rst doing the energy integrals as in the previous section. (hint:
use rotational invariance to point ~x in a particular direction to simplify the
angular integration.)

exercise vb4.3

although the propagator in momentum space is most useful for scatter-
ing of plane waves, its position-space dependence is more useful for bound
states/scattering of localized sources:

a evaluate the wick-rotated propagator in arbitrary dimensions d for large

x = x2 by
(1) fourier transforming the schwinger-prametrized form,

(2) performing the (gaussian) p integration before the t , and

(3) using the steepest descent approximation on the exponential to approxi-
mate the t integral (but dont bother sticking the power of t multiplying
the exponential in it as a log).

why does this approximation correspond to large x? (it may be useful to
make the redenition t  (x/m) .) you should nd the result

2m(d3)/2x(d1)/2emx

(x) 

after wick rotating back, the exponential becomes a phase inside the light-
cone, while outside it gives exponential damping, as in quantum mechanical

308

v. quantization

barrier penetration. (in the massless case, there is damping away from the
lightcone both inside and outside, but only by powers, determined by dimen-
sional analysis.)

b show the above result is exact in d=1 and 3 by

(1) fourier transforming without the schwinger parameter,

(2) performing a contour integral over the magnitude of p by closing it ap-
propriately and picking up the contributions at the poles at p = im,
and

(3) for d=3, xing xm in a particular direction and doing the angular part of

the p integration.

(this method can also be used to obtain the exact corrections to the above in
terms of elementary functions for higher odd d.) for the physical case of the
potential produced by a static point source in 3 spatial dimensions, we nd
(x) = 2emx/x, so at short range the coulomb potential is unmodied,
while it is exponentially damped at range 1/m.

c check the results for b by taking the massless limit, and comparing to the
analogous result using the method of a, but doing the t integral exactly
for those cases. (warning: the result is innite in d=1, and some type of
regularization must be used to subtract an innite constant, leaving a nite
x-dependent remainder.)

the corresponding eect on the action, where we path-integrated

is to integrate the wick rotated expression

2(vm2 + v1 .

eis :

es :

s =z d 1

this method also applies to relativistic eld theory. wick rotation t  it of the
kinetic term

now gives

:

es0

:

4[mn(m)(n) + m22]

4[mn(m)(n) + m22]

this has an interesting consequence in the complete action (including interac-
tions). positivity of the energy implied the non-time-derivative terms in the action

b. propagators

309

had to be positive, but the time-derivative terms are now the same sign in the wick-
rotated action, eectively the same as adding an extra spatial dimension: the energy
t + u is the same as the wick-rotated lagrangian (t + u  t + u). so we can
replace the condition of positivity of the energy with positivity of the wick-rotated
action, which we need anyway for path-integral quantization.
(note that for the
particle this again requires v  0.)

although wick rotation is thus very useful for application to intermediate
states, it can never be applied to physical (i.e., initial and nal) states: for ex-
ample, p2 + m2 = 0 has no solution in euclidean space, since each term is strictly
positive. typically, this means that one performs quantum calculations rst in eu-
clidean space, then wick rotates back to minkowski space before applying physical
state conditions.

unfortunately, the simple results for wick rotation obtained here for spin 0,
although they generalize to spin 1, do not work so simply for other spins. (consider,
e.g., trying it in spinor notation.) however, the method can still be applied to the
coordinates, and simplies momentum integrals, since one can avoid contours, is,
and minkowski minus signs.

a relativisitic quantum eld theory is dened by three properties:

(1) poincare invariance (relativistic) is the basic result of special relativity. its con-
sequences have been accurately observed both macroscopically and (sub)micro-
scopically, and no violations are known.

(2) unitarity (quantum) is the main mathematical result of quantum mechanics:
any quantum theory can be considered as the corrections to the classical theory
implied by unitarity. this is one way to dene perturbation theory, and is equiv-
alent to the usual (jwkb) expansion in h. (the other major axioms of quantum
mechanics are concerned with the physical interpretation of the quantities calcu-
lated, such as the preparation and measurement of states.) quantum mechanics
also has been accurately veried, with no observed violations.

(3) causality (eld theory) appears in many areas of physics, formulated in many
ways. the strongest way to state causality, in a way independent of special
relativity and quantum mechanics, is as locality: all interactions happen at a
point; there is no action at a distance. this means that any force applied by an
object at one point in spacetime on another elsewhere(/when) must be mediated
by yet another object that carries the eect of that force between the two. the
most accurate verications of this principle have been through the predictions of
relativistic quantum eld theory.

we now dene the perturbation expansion of the s-matrix, and give its general

properties.

1. path integrals

path integrals for relativistic quantum eld theory in four dimensions are better

in every way than canonical quantization. they are

(1) easier to learn and apply: just gaussian integrals.

(2) more heuristic: no dirac sea or harmonic oscillators (where are the springs?).

(3) less mathematical: no operators, so no time-ordered products (much less t*

ones), wick contraction, normal ordering, etc.

(4) more ecient: functionals make combinatoric factors automatic.

(5) more rigorous: constructive quantum eld theory has proven the existence of
certain relativistic quantum eld theories in less than four dimensions (working
in euclidean space).

c. s-matrix

311

(6) more covariant: the action and feynman rules are, so the middle steps should

be.

as we have seen in simpler examples (subsection va2), perturbation for path
integrals is based on taylor expansion of the exponential of the interaction (part
of the exponent higher than quadratic in the functional integration variables). since
general transition amplitudes involve also wave functions, we also taylor expand
them: in eld theory, this is an expansion in the number of particles. we therefore
write

 [] =

xn =0

1

n !z dm

1 ...dn
n
(2)n d/2 (x1)...(xn )m1m...mn nn (x1, ..., xn )

where we have used the covariant inner product of subsection vb3. (the surfaces of
integration are at t = .) we have also used the free n-particle wave function n ,

k1n = ... = kn n = 0

which is sucient to describe particles at t = . amplitudes for such asymptotic
states are elements of the s-matrix, as dened in the interaction picture (see subsec-
tion va4). in practice we choose a particular value of n, and use a basis element for
n , namely the product of n 1-particle wave functions:

n (x1, ..., xn ) =

nyi=1

n i(xi) + permutations   [] =

nyi=1

h|n ii

in principle, if there are bound states in the theory, we can consider similar wave
functions, but besides  we expand in the composite eld describing the bound state.
it should be possible to discover such states by looking at the properties of the
amplitudes of the  states. (for example, a two-particle bound state would show up
in the amplitude describing the scattering of two particles.)

2(0)q2 + ... or ( 1
2

note that the elds  are real (or we sum over both  and *), while the wave
functions ( or ) are complex: as usual in quantum mechanics, we work in a
complex hilbert space, but often expand over a real basis. for example, (q) =
(0) + (0)q + 1
we treat particles and antiparticles on an equal footing,  [] should include both the
initial and nal wave function: thus, the factors in  at t =  can be interpreted
as the usual positive-energy multiparticle wave functions, while the factors at t = +
can be interpreted as the complex conjugate of the usual positive-energy multiparticle
wave functions. since they each have one sign of the energy, they are necessarily
complex. however, for a real eld  we can have only h|i, while for a complex

1(cid:1). since in a covariant approach

eld  we distinguish h|i as representing a particle at t =  or an antiparticle
at t = +, and h*|i as an antiparticle at t =  or a particle at t = +. (as
usual, which we choose to call particle and which antiparticle is relative, because of
cpt invariance.)

we therefore want to evaluate the path integral

separating out the free and interacting pieces of the (gauge-xed) action,

a =z d eis[] []

s = s0 + si =z dx 1

2k + si

and using the integration identity

we have dropped the determinant factor, since in our case it will be only an overall
constant coming from the kinetic operator k. we then absorbed this proportionality
constant into the denition of d, as we did for the free particle in subsection va2.
in this case, this normalization is xed by the free part of the s-matrix.

it will prove convenient to distinguish the ends of propagators that attach to si

from those that attach to  , so using the identity

f (x)g(x, x + y) = f (x + y)g(x, y)

(x = x,

y = y + x)

we then evaluate the derivatives that act on only one or only the other:

evaluated at y = 0, we rewrite this expression as

z[] (the generating functional for the s-matrix) contains all propagators with
si[]s attached at both ends, and forms the basis of the perturbation expansion.
from the integration identity above, we can also write it as

z[] =z d ei(s0[]+si [+])

eectively, we have just taken the functional integralr d eis[] and separated the

eld into a quantum eld  (the integration variable) and a background eld ,
where  includes the asymptotic states, which propagate to innity, while  vanishes
at innity (or at least goes to a constant) fast enough to allow the usual integration
by parts in performing the functional integral. thus  gives the boundary value of
the eld. this is essentially the same as the general prescription for path integrals
given in subsection va2, except that we take  to be arbitrary for convenience of
functional dierentiation, and we drop free  terms, which were incorporated into 
(i.e., we expand just si).

 [] is the result of contracting some pairs of the one-particle wave functions
with propagators. this gives the usual inner product of those one-particle states:
since for any one-particle wave function satisfying the free eld equations we have
the propagator identity

such contractions give

dm
(2)d/2 (x)mm(x  x) = (x)

z
z dmdn
(2)d (x)mm(x  x)mn(x)
dm
(2)d/2 (x)mm(x) = h*|i = h*|i

=z

where the inner product vanishes unless  and  have opposite energies (i.e., one is
incoming and one is outgoing). this is the boring part of the s-matrix element: it
represents the corresponding particles not interacting at all. (for example, in the free
case si = 0 we have z = 1, and a = |=0 consists of only such inner products.) for

314

v. quantization

most purposes we just factor out such free inner products, and consider only processes
where all particles interact.

finally, the conversion from  to  replaces all the on-shell inner products with

integrals over all spacetime: using the propagator identity from above,

where n appears in  exactly as n in  :

 [] =

n (x1, ..., xn )m1m...mn n(x1)...(xn )

usually we represent n as the product of single-particle wave functions,

in which case  simply replaces each eld  in z with one of these wave functions.

thus, of the three types of propagators, only the ones that connected two factors
of si remain, all inside z; the ones that connect the wave functions to z have been
replaced with just spacetime integrals, while those connecting the wave functions to
each other have become the usual spatial integrals for the hilbert-space inner product.

making all inner products of non-scattering particles explicit. (hint: write
both this and the earlier form of the amplitude completely explicitly, in terms
of operators on z[] [].) we can interpret 0 as the free vacuum wave
functional and z0 as the interacting vacuum wave functional.

2. graphs

before giving applications of these rules, we consider a few general properties. a
convenient way to describe the terms in the expansion of the two exponentials in z
is pictorially, by feynman diagrams/graphs. each factor of si is a vertex of the
graph, represented by a dot in the diagram; each factor of the propagator 1/k is a
link in the graph, represented by a line connecting the two dots representing the
two factors of si on which each / acts. (both derivatives can also act on the same
factor of si, giving a loop.) so any term in the expansion of z is represented by a
diagram consisting of a bunch of dots (interaction vertices) connected by lines (prop-
agators). when we want to draw the amplitude a itself, we also draw additional
lines, each with one end attached to a vertex and one end unattached. these external
lines represent the one-particle wave functions coming from n , and not propagators
(internal lines). while in the diagram for z each vertex can have  dependence,
in the diagram for a there is none, and the number of lines (internal and external)
coming from any vertex explicitly indicates the order in  of the corresponding term
in si.

the physical interpretation of these diagrams is simple: the lines represent the
paths of the particles, where they act free, while the vertices represent their collisions,

where they interact. these diagrams are generally evaluated in momentum space: we
then can associate a particular momentum with each line (propagator), and momen-
tum is conserved at each vertex. an arrow is drawn on each line to indicate the
direction of ow of the momentum. (otherwise there is a sign ambiguity, since
complex conjugation in position space changes the sign of the momentum.) then the

sum of all momenta owing into (or all out of) a vertex vanishes. the momentum
associated with a line is then interpreted as the momentum of that particle, with
the arrow indicating the direction of ow of the proper time  . (p changes sign with

316

 .) when evaluating an s-matrix element, the fact that the external-line wave func-
tions satisfy the free wave equation means the external momenta are on-(mass-)shell
(p2 + m2 = 0); on the other hand, this is not true of the momenta on the internal
lines, even though those particles are treated as free.

some graphs in the s-matrix are disconnected: they can be divided into separate
parts, each with a subset of the particles that interact with each other but not with
the other subsets. for convenience, we consider only the connected graphs: if we
write

z[] = eiw [],

ac = (cid:20) 

(cid:21) (i)w []|=0

then w is the generating functional for the connected s-matrix ac. to prove this
relation between z and w , we rst note that it is just the combinatorics of the
graphs, and has nothing to do with spacetime. therefore, it is sucient to consider
the simple (unphysical) case where the action has no derivatives. since the propagator
is then local, connectedness is equivalent in this case to locality. we then observe
that the lack of derivatives allows the functional integral to be factorized explicitly
into ordinary integrals at each point in spacetime:

z[] =z d eir dx l((x),(x)) =yx z d(x) eil((x),(x))

=yx

z((x)) = eir dx w((x)) = eiw []

thus, this w is local, and therefore connected; this implies w is connected in the
general case. the simplest kind of connected graph is a tree graph, which is a graph
that has no closed paths; the rest are called loop graphs.

one-particle-irreducible (1pi) graphs are dened to be those connected graphs
that cant be disconnected by severing a single propagator. it then follows that any
connected graph can be represented as a generalized tree graph, whose vertices
(including two-point vertices) are actually 1pi graphs. we then dene the eective
action  [] to be the classical action plus all 1pi loop graphs. note that the vertices
of the original action are the 1pi tree graphs; thus  is also the classical kinetic term
plus all (tree and loop) 1pi graphs. actually, since the 1pi tree graphs are isi , we
dene the classical part of  to be s, but the quantum part to be the quantum 1pi
part of w . of course, the eective action is nonlocal. however, the tree graphs that
follow from this action are exactly all the connected graphs of the original action:
this is clear for all but the 2-point vertices from the denition. for the propagator
and its relation to the 2-point 1pi loop graphs, we simply compute the expression

following from  : denoting the 2-point 1pi loop operator as a, the kinetic operator

this quantum modication of the propagator leads us to reanalyze our prescrip-
tion for evaluating the s-matrix: for example, even in the simplest case, where this
a is just a constant, the full propagator diers from the free propagator by a change
in the mass. this means the mass of asymptotic states should also be changed, which
invalidates part of our evaluation of the s-matrix in the previous subsection. similar
problems occur when a is proportional to k, which changes the normalization of
asymptotic states. there are two ways to x these problems: (1) we compensate by
modifying the kinetic term in the classical action, replacing k with k minus such
local contributions from a. treating these new terms as part of the interaction in
our derivation of the s-matrix, so our normalization and mass in the free propagator
are unchanged, these interaction terms cancel the unwanted terms in the quantum
propagator, so it then has the same residue and pole as the free one. this procedure
is known as renormalization, and will be discussed further in chapter vii, primarily
for the purpose of eliminating innities. (2) alternatively, we modify our derivation
of the s-matrix to take the full propagator into account. the easiest way to see this
change is to remember that by denition the s-matrix follows from treating the eec-
tive action as a classical action (except for its nonlocality and nonhermiticity), but

g

318

v. quantization

keeping only the tree graphs. then clearly (a) the quadratic part 0 of  is used
to dene the asymptotic states, and (b) instead of eliminating all free propagators
except those connecting factors of si, we eliminate all full propagators (found from
0) except those connecting factors of i , the nonquadratic part of  . in other words,
we modify our earlier denition of the s-matrix by dropping all graphs that have any
quantum correction to external lines. thus, this procedure can also be applied in
the case of renormalization; in fact, it should be applied in general, simply because
it allows us to immediately ignore many graphs. it also allows us to avoid confusion
resulting from attaching wave functions of the wrong mass to propagator corrections:
e.g., in momentum space, we would have to interpret ambiguous factors such as
(k)a(1/k)..., where the factor of (k) comes from a plane-wave wave function.

this analysis of the quadratic part of  also leads us to examine the terms of
lower order: constant and linear. the constant term is just a normalization, and
should be dropped. (this is not true in the case of gravity, where a constant term in
the lagrangian is not gauge invariant by itself.) the linear term describes the decay
of a particle into the vacuum: it implies we have the wrong vacuum. a linear term
necessarily has no derivatives (otherwise it is a boundary term, which vanishes by our
boundary conditions); it is part of the eective potential (a generalization of the
potential energy, whose contribution to a classical mechanics lagrangian contains no
time derivatives; see subsection viib2). the existence of a linear term means that
the minimum of the eective potential, i.e., the true vacuum, is not described by
vanishing elds. to correct this situation we therefore apply the same procedure as
for the classical action (chapter iv): (1) shift the appropriate elds by constants,
to put us at the minimum of the potential, and (2) use the new quadratic terms in
the potential to determine the true masses of states dened by perturbation about
this new vacuum. again eliminating any constant terms, the resulting  has only
quadratic and higher-order terms.

to summarize, the general procedure for calculating feynman graphs is:

(1) calculate the eective action, i.e., the 1pi graphs.

(2) shift the scalars to put them at the minimum of the eective potential, dropping

the resultant constant, to reveal the true masses of all particles.

(3) calculate the s-matrix from diagrams without external-line corrections, with ex-
ternal wave functions whose normalization and masses are determined by the
zeroes of the kinetic operators in the shifted  .

another use of the eective action, besides organizing the calculation of the s-
matrix, is for studying low-energy behavior: this means we apply an expansion in
derivatives, as in rst-quantized jwkb (see subsection va2). of most interest is the
lowest order in the approximation, where all elds are eectively constant: this gives
the eective potential. (in practice, all elds means just the scalars, since constant
spinor elds are not generally useful, while higher spins are described by gauge elds,
whose constant pieces can be set to vanish in an appropriate formulation: e.g., the
constant piece of the metric tensor can be attributed to a scalar  see subsection
ixa7.) however, the denition of 1pi graphs is ambiguous, depending on how we
dene particle: for example, if we include auxiliary elds in the eective action (as
in supersymmetry, but also for bound-state problems: see subsections viib3 and 6),
the result at xed order in any expansion parameter (h, coupling, etc.) is dierent,
since the auxiliaries get contributions at each order, so elminating them by their
eective-action eld equations mixes orders. (e.g., b2 + hbf (a)  h2f 2.) this is
crucial when the composite elds dened by these auxiliaries, and thus the auxiliaries
themselves, obtain vacuum values. therefore, the eective action is most useful for
these purposes when, for appropriate choice of elds and denition of h, a useful
rst-quantized semiclassical expansion can be found. another important use of the
eective action is that it is gauge invariant (even in the nonabelian case, when using
the background-eld gauge; see subsection vib8): sometimes simplications due to
gauge invariance are thus easier to see in the eective action than in the s-matrix.

we now consider an interesting topological property of graphs:

(1) for any graph, if we draw an extra propagator from a vertex to itself or another,

that gives an extra loop (closed circuit) and no extra vertices.

(2) adding a 2-point vertex to the middle of a propagator or external line gives an

extra propagator and no extra loops.

(3) adding an external line to a vertex changes nothing else.

since any nontrivial (not a lone propagator) connected graph can be built up this
way from a lone vertex, we nd

p  v = l  1

for p propagators, v vertices, and l loops (and e external lines). the same result
follows from counting momentum integrals: in momentum space there is an inter-

320

v. quantization

nal momentum, and corresponding integral, for each propagator, and a momentum
conservation condition, and corresponding  function, for each vertex. the only in-
dependent momenta are the external ones (associated with each  in z[]) and one
momentum vector for each loop. thus, after integrating out all the delta functions,
except for an overall momentum conservation  function for each connected graph,
we are left with integrations over only the loop momenta. so, we are again led to the
above result.

exercise vc2.1

for the gure at the beginning of this subsection, check this identity for each
of the 3 connected graphs. apply the above construction to produce each of
them from a single vertex.

3. semiclassical expansion

we can dene perturbations by inserting hs in various ways, as discussed in sub-
section iiia3. the h that denes classical mechanics yields an expansion in derivatives
on matter elds (those that describe classical particles in the limit h  0, as op-
posed to the wave elds). this expansion is covariant as long as the h multiplies
covariant derivatives. however, it cant be applied to yang-mills elds, and it doesnt
correspond to a diagrammatic expansion. on the other hand, the h that denes clas-
sical eld theory is an expansion in the number of loops, and allows us to group
graphs in gauge-invariant sets, since gauge transformations are not h-dependent: as
in quantum mechanics, we can perform a jwkb expansion by appropriately inserting
h:

z[] =z d exp(cid:26)
= exp(cid:26)ihz dx 1

i
h

2

(s0[] + si[ + ])(cid:27)
(cid:27) eisi []/h




1
k



the order in h has a simple graphical interpretation. we see that there is a factor
of h for each propagator and a factor of 1/h for each vertex. thus, by the above
topological identity, for each connected graph the power in h is one less than the
number of loops. we therefore write

z[] = eiw []/h,

w =

hlwl

xl=0

where w0 generates the connected tree graphs, which have no loops.

we know that the leading term in the jwkb expansion is associated with the
classical theory. we can make this more explicit in the eld theory case by nding the

c. s-matrix

321

general classical (perturbative) solution to the eld equations from the tree graphs.
graphically the solution is very simple: we replace one  on each tree graph with a
propagator, and associate the end of the propagator with the position of the classical
eld (x). if we then act on this , which is a sum over all tree graphs, with k,
it cancels the propagator, leaving a bunch of s (also sums over all tree graphs)
connected at x, with the appropriate vertex factor. in other words, we nd k =
si[]/, the classical eld equations.

k

=

to prove this, its convenient to again use functionals, to automatically keep track
of all combinatorics. the quantum eld equations can be derived from the general
identity

z d




f [] = 0

since we only integrate functionals f that are assumed to fall o fast enough as
   to kill all boundary terms. (this follows from the perturbative denition of
the functional integral.) in particular, for any action s,

0 =z d ih




ei s/h =z d

for our present purposes, we choose

s = s0[] + si[ + ]

(and, of course,r d ei s/h = eiw/h).

we now examine the classical limit h  0 of this result by noting that if we

where s[] = s0[] + si[] is the usual action: in other words, the eld equations

since we chose our boundary conditions so   0 as x   (including |t|  ,
whereas   0 only at spatial innity). we then apply the stationary-phase approx-
imation (or, after wick rotation, the steepest-descent approximation)

lim

thus,  is the solution to the classical eld equations with boundary condition   ,
and can be found directly from the classical (0-loop) part of w by replacing one eld
with a propagator.

a similar result holds for w0 itself, by taking the classical limit as above for

f [] = 1:

w0[] = s0[] + si[ + ]

when evaluated at the result of varying the above with respect to either argument:

s[ + ]




 


 
 

= k = 0

w0[]



= k

the former follows directly from the limiting procedure; the latter we have just proven
equivalent by evaluating the limit for h i. since by denition the eective action 
is related to w in exactly the same way that s is related to w0 (the trees from 
give the full w ), we also have

w [] = 0[] + i [ + ]

w []



=  k

where k is the kinetic operator appearing in 0, the quadratic part of  . (some care
must be taken for the fact that the poles and residues of k in p2 may dier from
those of k, as discussed in the previous subsection.)

in practice, if one wants to make use of the classical eld equations perturbatively,
one looks at tree graphs with a specic number of external lines: for example, in a
scalar theory with 3 interaction (assuming hi = 0),

k + 1

22 = 0,  =

xn=1

n  kn + 1

n1xm=1

mnm = 0

gives a recursion relation for the term n that is nth order in .

exercise vc3.1

consider the relativistic schrodinger (klein-gordon) equation for a scalar
wave function  in an external scalar potential :

(k + ) = 0

(if you nd it less confusing, you can consider the nonrelativistic case k =
~p 2/2m  e, where h = ~p 2/2m + .) find the perturbative solution for the
quantum mechanical (one-particle) s-matrix for  (see exercise va4.1). show
that this agrees with the contribution to the eld-theoretic s-matrix for the
lagrangian

coming from tree graphs with an external  line, an external * line, and an
arbitrary number of external  lines.

exercise vc3.2

consider, instead of the background eld , a current source j that attaches
propagators to external lines. the current is eectively just a one-point in-
teraction (it caps loose ends of propagators), so it can be introduced into the
generating functional by the modication

note that j can be replaced with  in w [j] everywhere except the free term,
since in all other terms j appears only in the combination (1/k)j. show
how this can be done in such a way as to reproduce the results above for the
solution of the classical eld equations in terms of w []. warning: before
this substitution we use k + j = 0, but afterwards we apply k = 0; also
beware of integration by parts, since  does not vanish at , so the naive
substitution    +  is not very helpful. (historically, z was introduced as
a functional of j. however, the only two applications of feynman diagrams,
the s-matrix a and the eective action  , both required that the external-
line propagators resulting from the feynman rules for z[j] be amputated.
therefore, we use background elds exclusively. the resulting derivations,
generalities, and applications are at least as simple as and often a little simpler
than the corresponding ones with current sources.)

there is a major aw in this relation between classical eld theory and tree
graphs, the klein paradox. the dierence is that classical eld theory uses elds
everywhere, not wave functions. thus the propagator must be real (or pure imaginary,
depending on conventions) to preserve the reality (or complex conjugation) properties
of the elds; usually one uses the retarded propagator. on the other hand, in quantum
eld theory negative-energy states must travel backward in time to preserve positivity
of the true energy, so the complex stuckelberg-feynman propagator must be used.
furthermore, in classical eld theory the external line factors are the elds, which
contain both positive and negative energies, the same on each line. in quantum eld

c. s-matrix

325

theory, each external line carries a dierent one-particle wave function, positive energy
in the asymptotic past or negative energy in the asymptotic future.

4. feynman rules

it is usually most convenient to calculate feynman diagrams in wick-rotated
(to eliminate is) momentum space (where massive propagators are simpler). the
feynman rules are then read o of the action as

(cid:19) esi []

where in z[] we simply replace each eld  with a single-particle wave function in
all possible permutations, since for the case of an n-particle amplitude we usually
write the wave function as the product of n single-particle wave functions (although
more generally it is a linear combination of these):

an = n(cid:20)

we fourier transform as

(x) =z dp eipx(p),

(p) =z dx eipx(x)

(of course, (x) and (p) are dierent functions, but the distinction should be clear
from context.) in practice we choose the single-particle wave functions to be eigen-
states of the momentum, so

i(x) = eipix i(pi),

i(p) = (p  pi) i(pi)

(p2

i + m2 = 0)

where  is some simple factor (e.g., 1 for a scalar). then the external line factor
terms become

2(p2 + m2)

for nonzero spin (or internal symmetry), we have already discussed the normalization
analogous to that for scalars, namely

x (p) (p) = n(p)

(with  for negative energy and half-integer spin). however, there is already some
freedom with respect to coupling constants: even for scalars, if a coupling appears in
the kinetic term as a factor of 1/g2, then eectively the kinetic operator is k = k0/g2,
where k0 is the usual (coupling-independent) one. thus n = g2n0, so  = g 0,
meaning coupling dependence in external lines. alternatively, this external-line fac-
tor of the coupling can be included in the denition of probabilities in terms of
amplitudes, which already includes nontrivial factors because of the use of (non-
normalizable) plane waves. furthermore, quantum eects modify the form of the
propagator: such eects can be absorbed near the pole p2 = m2 by a eld redef-
inition, but often it is more convenient to leave them. then n will again have a
constant, (but more complicated) coupling-dependent factor, which must be canceled
in either the external-line factors or probabilities. (however, note that these questions
do not arise in calculations of the functionals w [] or  [].)

in tree graphs all momentum integrals are trivial, with the momentum conserva-
tion  functions at each vertex, and the  functions of the external lines, determining
internal momenta in terms of external momenta. in loop graphs there is a momentum

c. s-matrix

327

integral left for each loop, over the momentum of that loop. the amplitude will al-
ways have an overall  function for momentum conservation for each connected piece
of the graph. since we are always interested in just the connected graphs, we pull
this conservation factor o to dene the t-matrix: including the factor of i from
wick rotating back to minkowski space,

sconnected = i(cid:16)x p(cid:17) t

in general there will be combinatoric factors associated with a graph. these
follow automatically from the functional expressions, but can also be seen from the
symmetries of the graph. here symmetries means ways in which the graph can
be twisted, with external lines xed, such that the graph looks the same, including
the types of particles propagating along the lines. for example, a graph with 2
vertices that are connected by n identical propagators would get a factor of 1/n! for
that symmetry. there are also sign factors from fermions: permutation of external
fermion lines gives minus signs, because it involves permutation of anticommuting
elds in the functionals. each fermion loop gets a minus sign for the same reason.
(this is related to the fact that fermionic integration gives determinants instead of
inverse determinants.) explicitly, it comes from evaluating expressions of the form
(ignoring momentum dependence and external elds)

where the propagator derivatives (/ )(/) give no signs connecting up successive

the general rules for contributions to the (unrenormalized) eective action  []

are then:

2k).

(a1) 1pi graphs only, plus s0 (r 1
(a2) momenta: label consistently with conservation, withr dp for each loop.
(a5) external lines: attach the appropriate (o-shell) elds andr dp, with (p p).

(a3) propagators: 1/ 1
(a4) vertices: read o of si.

(a6) statistics: 1/n! for n-fold symmetry of internal/external lines;

2(p2 + m2), or 1/k, for each internal line.

1 for fermionic loop; overall 1.

(if we want to calculate w [] instead, then simply replace step 1 with connected
graphs only.) the next step is to analyze the vacuum:

328

v. quantization

(b1) find the minimum of the eective potential (for scalars).
(b2) shift (scalar) elds to perturb about minimum; drop constant in potential.
(b3) find resulting masses; nd wave function normalizations.

renormalization is performed either before or after this step, depending on the
scheme. finally, the trees from  are identied with the complete amplitudes from
s. thus, t-matrix elements are given by:
(c1) connected trees of (shifted, renormalized)  : (a2-4) for l=0 with s   .
(c2) amputate external 0-propagators.

(c3) external lines: 1, or appropriate to 0 wave equation k = 0 (p   = n).

(c4) external-line statistics: no symmetry factors; 1 for fermion permutation.

note that  is usually simpler than t with respect to treatment of external
lines: in t we often have contributions from graphs which are identical except for
permutation of external lines from identical elds. in  only one such graph need
be considered, since the statistics of the attached external elds automatically takes
care of this symmetry. (we then also drop the 1/n!, or at least reduce it.)

we label the lines of a graph with arrows to indicate the direction of ow
of momenta: momentum conservation means the total momentum owing into any
vertex is equal to that owing out, which we use to eliminate dependent momenta
(integrating out  functions). (in tree graphs all internal momenta are determined by
external ones, which are constrained by conservation of total external momentum.)
this sign of direction of the arrow is independent of the sign of the energy; we must
combine the two to determine whether an external state is initial or nal: an incoming
external line with positive energy is initial, negative energy is nal; an outgoing line
is the opposite (i.e., for positive energy the arrow indicates the direction of time, but
negative energy means travel backward in time). the choice of direction of arrows
is arbitrary, and the convenience of any choice depends on the graph and the theory.
there is no correspondence between this choice and signs of energy, since generally
one wants to apply the same graph for cases with each external line with either
sign, whereas internal lines in trees may have either sign depending on the external
kinematics, and those in loops must be summed over both signs. often the direction
of the arrow is chosen to indicate the direction of ow of positive charge, when such
a quantum number (u(1) symmetry) exists.

the simplest nontrivial tree graphs are 4-point amplitudes. we now label all
momenta as incoming, which is convenient for symmetry, and corresponds naturally
to using incoming (initial) states with positive energy and outgoing (nal) states
with negative energy (as from the complex-conjugate nal wave functions). these

momenta are conveniently expressed in terms of the mandelstam variables (see sub-
section ia4): with these signs,

s = (p1 + p2)2,

t = (p1 + p3)2,

u = (p1 + p4)2

we also use the convention that s is dened in terms of the momenta of the two
initial particles (and we also use this same denition when there are more than two
nal particles); t and u are then more or less interchangable, but if initial and nal
particles are pairwise related we choose t in terms of the momenta of such a pair.

the momentum integrals are real in euclidean space: there are no singularities
in the integrand, since p2 + m2 is always positive (although there are some subtleties
in the massless case). thus, all these integrals are most conveniently performed in
euclidean space. however, eventually the result must be analytically continued back
to minkowski space: x0  ix0, which means p0  ip0 (but p0  ip0, being also
careful to distinguish n
m and mn  mn for indices on elds) via a 90 rotation.
this returns some of the i dependence. there are also is associated with integration
measures: since all the momentum integrals for the s-matrix elements have already

m  n

been performed, all that remains is a factor of i to go with (p p) for each connected

graph. there can also be i dependence in external line factors.

remember that negative p0 indicates a particle traveling backward in time; the
true motion of such a particle is opposite to that of the arrow indicating momentum
ow. thus, external lines with arrows pointing into the diagram and positive p0, or
out of the diagram and negative p0, both indicate initial states, arriving from t = .
conversely, external lines with arrows pointing into the diagram and negative p0, or
out of the diagram and positive p0, both indicate nal states, departing to t = +.
a related issue is particles vs. antiparticles. if a particle is described by a real
eld, it is identied as its own antiparticle; but if it is described by a complex eld,
then it is identied as a particle if it has a certain charge, and as an antiparticle if
it has the opposite charge. (for example, a proton is positively charged while an
antiproton is negatively.) of course, this is convention, since a complex eld can
always be replaced by two real elds, and we can always relabel which is the eld
and which the complex conjugate; generally there should be a useful conservation law
(symmetry) associated with these complex combinations (usually electric charge),

c. s-matrix

331

and the one called particle is the one more common to the observer. for example,
suppose we have a complex scalar external eld/wave function (p). for p0 > 0 this
describes a particle propagating to x0 = +. similarly, *(p) for p0 > 0 describes
an anti particle propagating to x0 = +. on the other hand, * for p0 < 0 describes
a particle propagating from x0 = , while  for p0 < 0 describes an antiparticle
propagating from x0 = .

5. semiclassical unitarity

as in nonrelativistic quantum mechanics, the only conditions for unitarity are
that: (1) the metric (inner product) on the hilbert space is positive denite (so all
probabilities are nonnegative), and (2) the hamiltonian is hermitian (so probabilities
are conserved). both of these conditions are statements about the classical action.
the second is simply that the action is hermitian, which is easy to check. the rst is
that the kinetic (quadratic) terms in the action, which dene the (free) propagators,
have the right sign. this can be more subtle, since there are gauge and auxiliary
degrees of freedom. therefore, the simplest way to check is by using the lightcone
formalism.

we see from the analysis of subsection iib3 for eld equations, or for actions in
subsection iiic2 (for spins  1, and more generally below in chapter xii) that after
lightcone gauge xing and elimination of auxiliary degrees of freedom the kinetic
terms for physical theories always reduce to  1
4( /i+) for
fermions, where there is a sum over all bosons and fermions, and each term in the
sum has a eld with a single hermitian component. complex elds can multiply their
complex conjugates, but these can always be separated into real and imaginary parts.
there are never crossterms like a b, since after eld redenition, i.e., diagonalization
of the kinetic operator, this gives a a  b b, so one term has the wrong sign.
replaced by  m2 (as seen, e.g.,
similar remarks apply to massive elds, but with
by dimensional reduction), or we can treat the mass term as part of the interactions.

exercise vc5.1

whats wrong with a a + b b + m2ab? (hint: something, but none of
the above. diagonalize.)

now we only need to check that the single-component propagators of these two
cases dene positive-denite inner products. since multiparticle inner products are
products of uniparticle inner products, its sucient to look at one-particle states.
we therefore examine the s-matrix dened in subsection vc1 for the special case of
1 particle at t =  going to 1 particle at t = +, using the free, massless lightcone

332

v. quantization

lagrangians given above. for the boson we found that this matrix element was simply

the inner product between the two states, appearing in the formr d d . this

worked only because the propagator had the right sign. (it is essentially +ei|t|.)
thus the sign we use is required for unitarity.

a simple way to treat the fermion is to use supersymmetry: since the boson and

fermion kinetic terms are spin independent in the lightcone formalism, we can look at
any supersymmetric theory, and check the boson and fermion kinetic terms there. if

the boson term agrees with the one we just checked, then the fermion term is ok by
supersymmetry (which preserves unitarity by the lightcone-like supertwistor analysis

of subsection iic5). alternatively, we can use the same method applied to the boson:
the propagator now has an extra factor of 1/(i+), or 1/p+ in momentum space.
since p+ is always positive for positive energy, these states also appear with the
correct-sign norm. to analyze negative energy (antiparticles), we note that in the

derivation of the path integral nal states always appear to the left and initial states
to the right. in the fermionic case this is important because it will introduce an extra

sign: since

1 + 2 = +2 + 1

(with two signs canceling from reordering fermions and integration by parts), the
right sign will always be produced with correct ordering of initial vs. nal states

(i.e., positive vs. negative energy), independent of the helicity (or whether electron
vs. positron, etc.)

for similar reasons, it is clear that integral spin is always described by commut-
ing (bosonic) elds, while half-integral spin is always described by anticommuting

(fermionic) elds: the number of undotted minus dotted indices on a eld is always
odd for half-integer spin, even for integer, and a derivative carries one dotted and one

undotted index, so contraction of all indices means an even number of derivatives for
integer spin and odd for half-integer. without loss of generality, we then can separate

each eld into its real and imaginary parts. then for each real eld integration by

parts gives

(i)n = (1)n[(i)n] = (1)n+(i)n  (1)n+ = 1

where (1) is the statistical factor for  (1 for bosons, 1 for fermions), and we
have included the appropriate is for hermiticity of the action. thus, integer spin is
associated with bosons ((1)n = 1 = (1)), and half-integer with fermions ((1)n =
1 = (1)). this is the spin-statistics theorem. by using real elds with a

c. s-matrix

333

diagonal kinetic term, we have implicitly assumed kinetic terms appear only with the
correct sign: for example, for a complex bosonic eld

 = a + ib   = ai


 b = bi


 a

and thus has indenite sign. thus, spin and statistics follows from poincare invari-
ance, locality, and unitarity. if we drop unitarity, we get ghosts: well see examples
of such wrong-statistics elds when quantizing gauge theory.

note that demanding unitarity (the right sign of the kinetic term) is the same as
demanding positivity of the true energy, as least as far as the kinetic term is concerned:
the energy is given by the hamiltonian of the eld theory; if the kinetic term changes
sign, the corresponding contribution to the hamiltonian does also. (compare the
discussion of wick rotation of the action in subsection vb4.)

using anticommuting elds to describe fermions is more than a formality. in gen-
eral, the signicance of describing states by quantizing classical elds that commute
or anticommute has two purposes: (1) to avoid multiple counting for indistinguish-
able particles, and (2) to insure that two identical fermions do not occupy the same
state. thus, when describing two particles in dierent states, the phase associated
with (anti)commutation is irrelevant: a klein transformation can be made that
makes anticommuting quantities commute for dierent states, and anticommute (i.e.,
square to zero) only for the same state. however, such transformations are nonlocal,
and locality is crucial in relativistic eld theory. (see exercise ia2.3e.)

6. cutting rules

for some purposes it is useful to translate the three dening properties of relativis-
tic quantum eld theory into graphical language. poincare invariance is trivial, since
the propagators and vertices are manifestly poincare covariant in covariant gauges.
unitarity and causality can also be written in a simple way in functional notation. we
rst note that the inner product for free multiparticle wave functions can be written
very simply in momentum space as

d+ = 1

2z dp




(p)



+(p)

2(p2 + m2)]n(p)

cut propagator) projects onto the positive-energy mass shell.

v. quantization

takes care of the usual combinatoric factors.) we have written a generic propagator,
with numerator factor n (=1 for scalars). (without loss of generality, we have as-
sumed a real basis for the elds, so n can be taken as real.) the s-matrix amplitude
then can be written in operator language as

 [] = [][]  a =z d  []eis[] = (cid:20) 

(cid:21) z[] = h|s|i

we have used the fact that positive-energy states propagate forward in time and
negative backwards to write the usual hilbert-space inner product in terms of initial
and nal states of positive energy. the s-matrix operator s appears because  and
 satisfy the free equations of motion, and s performs time translation from t = 
for  to t = + for  to include interactions.

the unitarity condition is then (see subsection va4)

ss = 1  z[]ed+z[] = 1

while causality is



(x)(cid:18)s[]



(y)s[](cid:19) = 0 



(x)(cid:18)z[]ed+



(y)

z[](cid:19) = 0 f or x0 > y0

this causality relation, which already holds in nonrelativistic eld theory, can be
strengthened by using lorentz invariance: if (x y)2 > 0 (spacelike separation), then
x0 < y0 can be lorentz transformed to x0 > y0. thus, the above expression vanishes
everywhere except on or inside the backward lightcone with respect to x  y. these
functional forms of unitarity and causality (and poincare invariance) can also be used
as a basis for the derivation of the functional integral form of z[] in terms of the
action, rather than relying on its relation to the hamiltonian formalism.

the fact that these conditions are satised by feynman diagrams follows easily
from inspection. we examine them using the explicit expression for z following from
the functional integral:

z[] = edeisi ,

z[] = ed*eisi

etc.

from the results at the end of subsection vb2, we see that the propagators satisfy

the relations

+(x) = (x)  a(x) = *(x) + r(x)

+(x) = (x), (x) = (x), r(x) = a(x)

and, of course, r(x) = 0 for x0 < 0. we will now see that the cancelations in
the unitarity and causality relations occur graph by graph: there are contributions
consisting of a sum of terms represented by exactly the same diagram, with each
term diering only by whether each vertex comes from z or z. first, this aects
the sign of the term, since each vertex from z gets an extra sign from the eisi in z,
as compared to the eisi in z. second, this aects which propagators appear:

(x, y) in : (z, z)  (x  y)
(z, z)  +(x  y)
(z, z)  (x  y)
(z, z)  *(x  y)

s

d +

now if we sum over two terms diering only by whether the position x of one
particular vertex appears in z or z, the result before integration is proportional to

y (x  yi)y (x  zj) y +(x  yi)y *(x  zj)

where yi are from z and zj are from z. however,

(x  y)  +(x  y) = (x  y)  *(x  y) = r(y  x) = 0
writing  = + + r and  = * + r in the dierence of the two products,
each surviving term in the dierence contains a r, and therefore the two products
cancel if x0 is the latest of all the vertices. we thus take any sum of the same
diagram over dierent distributions of the vertices between z and z occuring in the

336

v. quantization

unitarity or causality relation before integration over the coordinates of the vertices,
separate the sum into pairs which are identical except for whether the latest vertex is
in z or z, and apply the above relation to show this dierence vanishes. thus, the
vanishing of a sum of graphs indicated by unitarity or causality is actually satised by
cancelation between each pair of terms before integration over coordinates. (which
pair is determined by the values of the coordinates, since we need to nd the latest
one; after integration, the cancelation is between the whole set of terms for the same
graph.) in the unitarity relation we sum over whether a vertex occurs in z or z for
each vertex, including the latest one, so that condition is easily satised. (the only
diagram that survives is the one with no particles, which gives 1.) in the causality
relation we perform this sum for each vertex except y (since /(y) acts only on z),
but since y0 < x0, y0 is not the latest vertex, so again the latest one is summed over.

exercise vc6.1

consider an arbitrary 1-loop graph. why would replacing all the propagators
 with advanced propagators a (or all with retarded propagators r) all the
way around the loop in the same direction give zero? use this result, and the
relation between the various propagators, to show that any one-loop diagram
(with normal propagators) can be expressed as a sum of products of tree
graphs, with some summations of external states (feynman tree theorem).
how does this dier from the cutting rule for unitarity? (hint: look at the
signs of the energies of external states.)

there is one ne point in this construction: we may use feynman rules from a
complex action, such as those used for massive theories in subsection iiic4, or when
using complex gauges (see section vib). in that case, since the s-matrix s is gauge-
independent, and the original action s was real (before eliminating complex elds
or choosing complex gauges), it is legal to use the hermitian conjugate action s to
dene the feynman rules for s (and z): when multiplying ss, we use the usual
rules to nd the second factor s, and the conjugate rules to nd the s used in the
rst factor s:

ss = [s(s)]s(s)

the result of conjugating the s-matrix then will be to complex conjugate twice, and
return rules identical to those used for s, except for the dierences noted above for

c. s-matrix

337

real actions. that means that the above proof of the cutting rules goes through
unmodied, where we use the same complex rules in the entire diagram, regardless of
whether they are associated with z or z. in particular, this means that vertices from
the two parts of the graph will dier only by sign (conjugating just the i in eisi , not the
si), and propagators will dier only by their (momentum-space) denominators, not
their numerators. this is particularly important for the complex elds of subsection
iiic4, since otherwise even the types of indices carried by the elds would dier.

7. cross sections

in quantum physics, the only measurables are probabilities, the squares of abso-
lute values of amplitudes. since we calculate amplitudes in momentum space, proba-
bilities are expressed in terms of scattering of plane waves. they are more naturally
normalized as probabilities per unit 4-volume (or d-volume in arbitrary dimension),
since plane waves are uniformly distributed throughout space. this can be seen ex-
plcitly from the amplitudes: because of the total momentum conservation -function
that appears with each connected s-matrix element sf i, we have for the probability
p

sf i = i(cid:16)x p(cid:17) tf i

 p = |sf i|2 = |tf i|2(cid:16)x p(cid:17) (0) = |tf i|2(cid:16)x p(cid:17)

where we have found the coordinate d-volume by the fourier-transform denition of
the -function:

(0) =z dx 1 =z

ddx
(2)d/2 1 =

vd

(2)d/2

a cross section is dened as a probability for the scattering of two incoming
particles into some number of outgoing particles. the scattering is elastic if the
two nal particles are the same as the two initial particles (they exchange only 4-
momentum), inelastic otherwise. generally one particle is in a beam directed at a
target (at rest in the lab frame) containing the other incoming particle, but in some
experiments two beams are directed at each other. in either case the cross section is
dened by the rate at which one particle interacts divided by the ux of the other
particle, where

f lux =

rate of arrival

area

= (density)  (relative velocity)

and thus the dierential cross section (yet to be integrated/summed over nal
states) is

d =

p
vd 

1

12v12

338

v. quantization

the total cross section  is then given by summation over all types of nal states
and integration over all their remaining momentum dependence.

the spatial density  is the integrand of the spatial integral that denes the inner

product: from subsection vb2, for bosonic plane waves (p(x) = eipx) we have

 t =z dd1x

where  = |p0|. (the same result can be obtained for fermions, when their external
line factors are appropriately normalized.)

the expression for d is actually independent of the frame, as long as the 3-
momenta of the two particles are parallel. this is the case for the most frequently
used reference frames, the center-of-mass frame and the lab frame for either particle
(where that particle is at rest, as is the lab if that particle is part of a target). then

(this includes elastic scattering.) the dierential cross section d/d,

for some purposes (such as considerations of unitarity and causality, as in the

itself (or actually |t|2).
in such a diagram we draw one of the diagrams from s

and one from s, separating the two by a line (dashed, zig-zag, or shaded on one
side, according to your preference), and connecting all the external lines (initial and
nal) on one side to the corresponding ones on the other. the result is a bubble
diagram with a cut: the cut propagators are + = 2(p0)n[ 1
2 (p2 + m2)]
(or , depending on how we label the momenta), corresponding to the propagator
 = n/ 1
2(p2 + m2), if we sum over all polarizations; otherwise n is replaced by a

term in the sum n = p  . the momenta of the cut propagators may not be

integrated over, depending on whether they represent nal states whose momenta
are summed over (i.e., not measured; in practice the momenta of initial particles
are always measured). the only other dierence in the feynman rules from the s-
matrix is that in wick rotating back s gets the usual m2  m2  i while s gets

m2  m2 + i, and each connected graph in s gets an i(p p) while each in s
gets a i(p p). the algebra for the cross section is thus identical to that of a

vacuum bubble (although the momentum integration is not, and the cut propagators
lack the usual denominators). in particular, instead of summing over just physical
polarizations in a cut vector propagator, which corresponds to using a unitary gauge,
we can include ghosts in the external states, and use any gauge: this follows from
the cutting rules derived for unitarity.

8. singularities

we know from free theories that any propagator has a pole at the classical value of
the square of the mass. this statement can be extended to the interacting theory: the
(landau) singularities in any feynman diagram are exactly at classically allowed
(on shell) values of the momenta.

the simplest way to see this is to write the propagators in a way reminiscent of
the classical theory, where the appearance of the worldline metric in the action results
in the (wick-unrotated) schwinger parametrization of the propagator,

i

1
2(p2 + m2)

=z 

0

d ei (p2+m2)/2

for simplicity we consider a scalar eld theory with nonderivative self-interactions.
the corresponding form of a feynman diagram, written in momentum space by
fourier transformation, is then

z dxidpijdij eiphiji

[ij(p2

ij +m2)/2(xixj )pij]

where i, j label vertices (and external endpoints), hiji labels links (propagators), and
dx indicates integration over just vertices not attached to external lines.

342

v. quantization

integration over these xs produces  functions for momentum conservation:

pij = 0

xj

i.e., the sum of all momenta owing into any vertex vanishes. (note pij = pji.) this
constraint can be solved by replacing momenta associated with each propagator with
momenta associated with each loop (and keeping momenta associated with external
lines). for example, for planar diagrams, we can write

pij = pij = ki  kj

where i, j label loops: pij labels the propagator by the two loops on either side,
rather than the vertices at the ends (and similarly for ij = ij ). similar remarks
apply to nonplanar diagrams, but the parametrization in terms of loop momenta ki is
more complicated because of the way external momenta appear. (in the planar case,
the above parametrization can also be used for external momenta, and automatically
enforces overall momentum conservation.) the feynman integral then becomes

z dkidij eiphij i

ij [pij (k)2+m2]/2

where k are loop (k) and external momenta after solving the conservation conditions.

we can now treat the exponent of the feynman diagram in the same way as a
classical mechanics action, and nd the corresponding classical equations of motion by
varying it. by the stationary phase approximation (or steepest descent, after wick
rotation of  ), the classical solutions give the most important contribution to the
integrals (at least for weak coupling). this approximation is related to long-distance
(i.e., infrared) behavior (see exercise vb4.3a). taking account of the fact that the  s
are constrained to be positive (by treating  = 0 separately or making a temporary
change of variables  = 2 or e to an unconstrained variable), we nd

ij (p2

ij + m2) = 0, xj

ij pij = 0

or, in terms of the original variables,

ij(p2

ij + m2) = 0,

pij =

xi  xj

ij

, xj

pij = 0

these are known as the landau equations. their correspondence with classical
congurations of particles follows from treating  as the proper time, as seen from
p = x/ . (actually, it is the generalization discussed in section iiib of proper time

c. s-matrix

343

to include the massless case; in the massive case s = m .) the equation  (p2+m2) = 0
says that either the particle for the line is on-shell or there is no such line (it has

vanishing proper length), while the equation pj  p = 0 says that the sum of  p

around a loop vanishes, another statement that p = x.

exercise vc8.1

consider the one-loop propagator correction: the graph where a single par-
ticle of mass m splits into two of masses m1 and m2, which rejoin. what is
the physical condition relating these 3 masses (with all particles on shell to
satisfy the above)? what happens when m = m1 + m2? what if m2 = 0?

note that these physical singularities are all in physical minkowski space:

in
euclidean space, p2 + m2 is positive denite, so it never vanishes (except for constant,
massless elds p = m = 0). furthermore, in euclidean space, one can always rotate
any momentum to any direction, whereas in minkowski space one can never lorentz
transform to or through either the forward or backward lightcone. thus, calculating
in euclidean space makes it clear that s-matrix elements for positive-energy states
are given by the same expressions as those for negative-energy states: to compare
two amplitudes that are the same except for some nal particles being replaced with
initial antiparticles, or vice versa, we just change the sign of the energy. this is
called crossing symmetry. in the case where all particles are reversed, it is cpt
invariance (cpt theorem).

9. group theory

although the manipulation of spin indices in feynman diagrams is closely tied to
momentum dependence, the group theoretic structure is completely independent, and
can be handled separately. therefore, it is sucient to consider the simple example
of scalars with a global symmetry. (the more physical case of chromodynamics will
be the same with respect to group theory, but will dier in dependence on momentum
and spin.) the simplest case is the u(n) family of groups. we choose an action of
the form

l = 1

g2 tr[ 1

4()2 + v ()]

where  is a hermitian nn matrix. this action is invariant under the global u(n)
symmetry

 = uu1

a simplication we have chosen is that the interaction has only a single trace; this
is the case analogous to pure yang-mills theory.
(we also included the coupling
constant as in yang-mills.)

color

flavor

gluon

quark

when we draw a feynman diagram for this eld theory, instead of a single line for

each propagator, we draw a double (parallel) line, each line corresponding to one of

the two indices on the matrix eld. because of the trace in the vertex, the propagator

lines connect up there in such a way that eectively we have continuous lines that

travel on through the vertices, although the two lines paired in a propagator go their

separate ways at the vertex. these lines never split or join, and begin or end only on

external elds. we can also draw arrows on the lines, pointing in the same direction

everywhere along a single line, but pointing in opposite directions on the two lines

in any propagator pair: this keeps track of the fact that  appears in the trace
always multipled as  and never as t . a physical picture we can associate with
this is to think of the scalar as a bound-state of a quark-antiquark pair, with one

line associated with the quark and another with the antiquark; the arrows are then

oriented in the direction of time of the quark (which is the opposite of the direction

of time for the antiquark). the quark is thus in the dening representation of u(n)

(and the antiquark in the complex conjugate representation). group theory factors

are trivial to follow in these diagrams: the same color quark continues along the

extent of a quark line; thus, there is a kronecker  for the two indices appearing

at the ends of the quark line (at external elds); each quark is conserved.

exercise vc9.1

using the quark-line notation, where the lines now represent avor, draw all 4-
point tree graphs, with 3-point vertices, representing scattering of k +k 
+ (see subsection ic4) via exchange of other (pseudo)scalar mesons in
that u(6) multiplet. what are the intermediate states (names of mesons) in

each channel? note that the avor ow of both diagrams can be represented

by a single diagram, by separating all pairs of intermediate lines to leave a

c. s-matrix

345

square gap in the middle: this duality diagram represents the mesons as
strings; the gap between quarks represents the worldsheet.

exercise vc9.2

consider quark-line notation for doing group theory in general: (calculate
using only graphs, with numerical factors  no explicit indices or kronecker
s, except for translating denitions.)

a write the structure constants for u(n) as the dierence of two diagrams, by

considering a vertex of the form tr(a[b, c]).

b find pictorially the resulting expression for the cartan metric (see subsection
ib2): show that it is the identity times 0 for the u(1) subgroup and 2n for

the su(n) subgroup (as found previously in subsection iiic1).

c also use these diagrams to prove the jacobi identity (i.e., nd the resulting

6 diagrams and show they cancel pairwise).

d derive diagrammatically the value of dijk of exercise ib5.3b for the dening

representation.

exercise vc9.3

consider the group theory factors for the above scalar theory, with only a

cubic interaction. draw all the 1pi 1-loop diagrams with 4 external double-
lines, and rewrite the corresponding factors in terms of traces and products
of 4 elds, including factors of n. (be careful to include all permutations of
connecting propagators to vertices.)

in general, we nd that connected feynman diagrams may include diagrams that

are disconnected with respect to the above group-theory diagrams, where we consider
the two group-theory lines on an external line to be connected. such diagrams corre-
spond to multiple traces: there is a factor of the form tr(gigj...gk) corresponding
to each connected group-theory graph, where i, j, ..., k are the group-theory indices
of the external lines (actually double indices in the previous notation). however, all

connected trees are group-theory connected. furthermore, they are all planar: any
connected u(n) tree can be drawn with none of the quark lines crossing, and all the
external lines on the outside of the diagram, if the external lines are color-ordered
appropriately. of course, one must sum over permutations of external lines in the
t-matrix because of bose symmetry. however, in calculating w [] one need consider

only one such planar graph, with the external lines color-ordered; the bose symmetry
of the elds in w automatically incorporates the permutations.
(similar remarks
apply to loop and nonplanar graphs.)

346

v. quantization

as an example, consider the u(n) generalization of the 4-point tree example of
subsection vc4. the lagrangian is now (scaling the coupling back into just the
vertex)

l = tr{ 1

4[()2 + m22] + 1

3g3}

where the interaction term now has a combinatoric factor of 1
6 because
it is symmetric only under cyclic permutations. the result for w is now modied to

3 instead of 1

w = g2trz dx 1

2 2

2(m2  )

this analysis for u(n) can be generalized to su(n) by including extra diagrams
with lines inside propagators short-circuited, representing subtraction of traces. it can
also be generalized to so(n) and usp(2n): in those cases, antisymmetry or symmetry
of the matrices means the lines no longer have arrows, and we include diagrams
where the lines inside the propagators have been twisted, with signs appropriate
to symmetrization or antisymmetrization. generalization for all the above groups
to include dening representations is also straightforward: such elds, like the true
quarks in qcd, carry only a single group-theory line. for example, sticking with
our simpler scalar model, we can generalize to a scalar theory with the same group
theory as chromodynamics, with free quark elds, appearing as scalar elds in the
dening representation of the group:

l  l + tr[ 1

2 ()  () + f ()],

 = uu1

f

where  is an nm matrix with m avors, and uf is the avor symmetry. (this
color+avor symmetry was treated in subsections ic4 and iva4.) this eld has a
propagator with a single color line (with an arrow); however, we can also use another
double-line notation, where  propagators carry one line for color and another for
avor. this method can be generalized to arbitrary representations obtained by
direct products of dening representations, (anti)symmetrizations, and subtractions
of traces, by giving the propagators the corresponding number of lines (though usually
two lines are sucient for the interesting cases).

vi. quantum gauge theory

we now consider special features of spin and gauge invariance, and introduce some
special methods for dealing with them. in quantum theory, gauge xing is necessary
for functional integration: gauge invariance says that the action is independent of
some variable; integration over that variable would thus give innity when evaluating
amplitudes for gauge-invariant states. eliminating that variable from the action (a
unitary gauge) solves the problem, but not always in the most convenient way. (if
it were, we wouldnt have introduced such a redundant description in the rst place.)
note that such innities already appear for global symmetries: for example, the
functional integral with wave function 1 (vacuum-to-vacuum amplitude) is innite by
translation invariance. this innity is easier to understand for a nontrivial amplitude
in momentum space, as a factor of a momentum-conservation -function (which is
either  or 0, but necessarily  for the vacuum amplitude, which has vanishing
momentum because the vacuum is translationally invariant).

we have seen the relationship of gauge invariances to constraints in subsection
iiia5. in this section we consider the quantization of constrained systems, and its
application to gauge theories. the becchi-rouet-stora-tyutin (brst) method is
not only the most powerful, but also the easiest way to gauge x: it replaces the
gauge symmetry with an unphysical, fermionic, global symmetry that acts only on
unphysical degrees of freedom.

1. hamiltonian

physical observables commute with the constraints. thus, time development is
described by the gauge-invariant hamiltonian hgi, or we can set the gauge elds i
equal to some arbitrary functions f i as a gauge choice:

i = f i  h = hgi + f igi

in quantum mechanics, physical states should be annihilated by the constraints. how-
ever, more generally we can require only that these states satisfy the constraints
through expectation values:

this condition is satised by dividing up the constraints into:

h|gi|i = 0

350

vi. quantum gauge theory

(1) a subalgebra g0 that annihilates all physical states,
(2) complex lowering operators g that also annihilate these states, and are a

representation of the subgroup generated by g0, and

(3) their hermitian conjugate raising operators g+ = g.
(we treat +, , and 0 here as multivalued indices.) thus,

(g0  const.)|i = g|i = h|(g0  const.) = h|g+ = 0

where we have allowed for normal-ordering constants to be included as eigenvalues
of (an abelian subeset of) the g0 constraints. in the abelian case, it then follows
that, although g+ do not annihilate these states, they generate gauge invariances:

|i = g+| +i,

g0| +i = g| +i = 0

preserves the inner product of such states as well as the constraints on |i.

unfortunately, things get more complicated in the nonabelian case. for example,

the gauge invariance and constraints above are no longer compatible in general:

0 = g|i = gg+| +i = [g, g+]| +i = if+

+g+| +i 6= 0

however, one example that doesnt have this problem is the simple case where
+ = 0): if we choose
there are only 3 constraints, forming an su(2) algebra (so f+
g to be the lowering operator and g+ to be the raising operator, then the constant
appearing for g0 is simply the lowest eigenvalue in some irreducible representation in
the hilbert space |i, and the constraints pick out the corresponding state (or states,
if there is more than one representation with that spin).

a convenient way to deal with this problem is to replace the nonabelian algebra
gi with a single operator, which is therefore abelian. we dene a brst operator q
that imposes all constraints gi by adding a classical anticommuting ghost variable
ci, and its canonical conjugate bi,

for each constraint:

{bi, cj} = j

i

q = cigi  i 1

2 cicjfji

kbk

the second term has been added to insure the poisson bracket or commutator

{q, q} = 0

a. becchi-rouet-stora-tyutin

351

so that its crossterm cancels the square of the rst term, while its own square vanishes
m = 0. quantum mechanically, the brst operator is
by the jacobi identity f[ij
nilpotent:

lfk]l

{q, q}  2q2 = 0
we can also describe the ghost dependence by the ghost number

quantum mechanically

j = cibi  [j, q] = q

(quantum mechanically, we need to normal order these expressions for q and j.)
each anticommuting ghost and its conjugate will serve to cancel each commuting
constraint and its conjugate gauge degree of freedom. (similarly, bosonic ghosts are
introduced for fermionic constraints, so each term in q is fermionic.)

the brst operator provides a convenient method to treat more general gauges
than  = f , such as ones where the gauge elds become dynamical, which will prove
useful particularly in relativistic theories. now the original physical observables a
will satisfy

[gi, a] = [bi, a] = [ci, a] = 0  [q, a] = [j, a] = 0
and similarly the physical quantum mechanical states |i will satisfy
(g0, g; b0, b; c+)|i = 0  q|i = j|i = 0

0, f0+

where we have used the fact the only nonvanishing structure constants are f00
f0, f++
due to normal ordering.) we also have the gauge invariances

+,
k. (in the quantum case there are also some subtleties

+, f, and f+

a = {q, },

|i = q|i

for arbitrary operators  and (unrelated) states |i, since the q-terms wont con-
tribute when evaluating matrix elements with states annihilated by q:

(h1| + h1|q)(a + {q, })(|2i + q|2i) = h1|a|2i

the gauge invariances are consistent with the constraints because of the nilpotence
of the brst operator. (so q(|i + q|i) still vanishes, etc.) states satisfying

q|i = 0,

|i = q|i

(i.e., we identify states that dier by q on something) are said to be in the coho-
mology of q (brst cohomology), and operators satisfying

[q, a] = 0,

a = {q, }

352

vi. quantum gauge theory

are said to be in its operator cohomology.

(the latter cohomology also has a

exercise via1.1

assume that each physical state can be represented as a physical observable
(hermitian operator) acting on a ground state, which is itself physical:

|i = a|0i,

a = a,

q|0i = 0

show how this relates the gauge parameters and cohomologies of |i and q.
the brst operator incorporates the ghosts that are necessary to generalize treat-
ment of the constraints to the nonabelian case: for example, to reproduce the gauge
transformations of the abelian case, we choose

|i = b+| +i,

q| +i = 0  |i = q|i = g+| +i

where

gi = {q, bi} = gi  icjfji

kbk

are the gauge-xed constraints, which include an extra term to transform the ghosts
as the adjoint representation. they reduce to just gi in the abelian case, but add
ghost terms to the gauge transformation law otherwise.

in particular, the hamiltonian is a physical operator describing the energy and

the time development, so we can write

h = hgi + {q, },
for some . this includes gauge xing for the gauge i = f i discussed above, using:

[q, hgi] = 0  t (cid:16)eir dt h(cid:17) = t (cid:16)eir dt hgi(cid:17) + {q, }

 = f ibi  h = hgi + f i gi, l = (

.
qmpm  i

.
cibi) + h

the ghost terms in gi only aect the time development of unphysical states in this
gauge.

for example, when calculating s-matrix elements, the result is independent of
the gauge choice , as long as both the gauge-invariant hamiltonian hgi and the
states are brst invariant. (hgi commutes with q, the initial and nal states are
annihiliated by it.) it is also independent of the gauge choice |i for |i  |i+q|i.
(such a residual gauge invariance persists even though the asymptotic states satisfy
the free eld equations.)

in the cases of interest in relativistic physics, the constraints always consist of a
linear term depending only on the canonical momenta p (conjugate to the fundamental

a. becchi-rouet-stora-tyutin

353

variables q), at least after some redenitions, plus higher-order terms, which can be

treated perturbatively. therefore, as the simplest nontrivial example, we consider a

model with a single variable q, with

hgi = 0, g = p  q = cp

if we assume boundary conditions on the wave functions such that they can be taylor

expanded in q (they can always be expanded in c), we can write

(q) = hq|i =

xn=0

(n + cn) 1

n!qn

and similarly for (q). we then examine |i = q|i, comparing terms with the
same power of c and q on both sides of the equation, to nd n and n. we then
see that we can easily gauge n = 0 for all n by choosing certain coecients in |i
to be n (so n = n + n = 0). looking at q|i = 0, we then nd that n = 0
for all n except n = 0, so only the constant piece of  survives. in other words, the

cohomology is given by

q|i = 0,

|i = q|i  p|i = b|i = 0

so, solving for the cohomology of q = cp is the same as solving the constraint p = 0

without ghosts.

find the cohomology of the brst operator

[a, d] = [d, a] = {c, b} = {b, c} = 1

(the other commutators vanishing), by expanding in creation operators a, b,
c, d about a vacuum state destroyed by the annihilation operators a, b, c, d.
(this is the common alternative to the boundary conditions used for q = cp

above.) compare the method of constraints used in the abelian case.

2. lagrangian

to obtain more interesting gauges we need some extra bosonic variables, such
as the gauge elds i that we lost along the way, and their canonical conjugates
(nakanishi-lautrup elds) bi,

[bi, j] = ij

i

as well as their corresponding ghosts (antighosts) ci. we can do this in a trivial
way by including constraints that set b to zero:

q = cigi  i 1

j = cibi  cibi

where ci is conjugate to bi,

as a simple example, consider

{ci, bj} = j

the action now includes the gauge elds and all the ghosts as dynamical variables:

.
qmpm +

l = (

.
ibi  i

.
cibi  i

.
bici) + hgi + {q, }

for this gauge we can eliminate b and b by their equations of motion; assuming gi
is only linear in p, we then can eliminate p to return completely to a lagrangian
formalism:

l = lgi(q, ) 

.
ibi  i(tci)

.
ci

where lgi represents the original gauge-invariant action (which depended on both q
and , including time derivatives), and t is the covariant (time) derivative:

tci =

.
ci + cjkfkj

i

.
the gauge condition (from varying b) is now
 = 0, generalizing the non-derivative
gauges found without the antighosts and nakanishi-lautrup elds. correspondingly,
the ghost term is now second order in derivatives.

lagrangian in the hamiltonian form  .

now that we understand the principles, all these manipulations can be performed
directly in the lagrangian formalism. this will have the advantage that in eld
theory the lagrangian is manifestly lorentz covariant, while the hamiltonian (or the
qp+h) is not, because of the way it singles out
time derivatives (and not spatial ones). (consider, e.g., electromagnetism.) similarly,
the gauge gi = 0 is usually not lorentz covariant. we can work with just the original
variables q,  plus the new variables b, c, c, and dene q by the transformation it
induces (as derived from the hamiltonian formalism):

where i is the gauge transformation induced by gi ([gi,
] in the hamiltonian for-
malism). note that the brst transformations of the original variables are exactly
the same as the gauge transformations, with the gauge parameters replaced with
the corresponding ghosts. we can also consider the nakanishi-lautrup elds b as
original variables, with the fact that they dont occur explicitly implying they have
constraints b = 0. alternatively, we can treat the antighosts c as pure gauge degrees

thus, in the hamiltonian formalism we never quantize with h = hgi + g, but
can use just hgi and  = 0, which is equivalent to using hgi + {q, } for any ,

exercise via2.2

repeat exercise via2.1 directly in the lagrangian formalism. (find l, etc.)

all our results for quantization apply equally well in the path-integral formalism,

which can be applied to either the hamiltonian or lagrangian. (of course, for eld

theory we will be interested in applying brst to path integrals for lagrangians.)

we then evaluate matrix elements as

a =z d  []eis[];

s = sgi + q,  = gi + q ;

qsgi = qgi = 0

sgi and gi depend on just the physical elds (no ghosts), so they are gauge invariant
as well as brst invariant. for s-matrices, since  is an asymptotic state, the brst

operator used for its constraint and gauge invariance can be reduced to its free part:
q then acts on only the gauge elds. the statement of gauge invariance of gi is then
equivalent to the requirement that gauge elds appear in it only as their abelian eld

strengths. for example, the usual gauge vector a describing electromagnetism ap-

pears in single-particle factors in the wave functional ( [] =q 1[] as in subsection

vc1) only as:

1[a] = haa|ai,

aa = a,

a =  = 0

 0 = 1 = haa|ai = h|aai

using 0h|i = 0 (where the relativistic inner product h | i was dened in subsection
vb2). the transversality of a is equivalent to coupling to the abelian eld strength,
since

aa = 0  a = bab  haa|ai = 1
in terms of an antisymmetric-tensor external-line factor ab.

3. particles

we have seen that the relativistic particle (with or without spin) is a simple
example of a contrained system. for the simplest case, spin 0, the brst operator
follows simply from the single constraint:

q = c 1

2(  m2)

unlike the nonrelativistic case, the relativistic hamiltonian is identied with this
constraint. since we know constraints are treated by the brst operator, we can
consider writing the eld theory action in terms of it:

s0 = z dx dc 1

2q

using the explicit c dependence of the eld  = ic, we nd the usual scalar kinetic
term.  is thus the usual eld, while  is an antield, which has opposite statistics
to  (fermion instead of boson). well see in chapter xii that q can be constructed
straightforwardly for arbitrary spin, and has a simple expression in term of generalized
spin operators.
(as in nonrelativistic theories, spin is easier to treat directly in
quantum mechanics rather than by rst-quantization of a classical system.) the
kinetic term then generally can be written as a slight modication of the above. then
the antields will be found to play a nontrivial function, rather than just automatically
dropping out as in this case.

from the constraints and their algebra for spin 1/2 (see also exercise iiib1.2) we

nd the brst and ghost-number operators:

q = c 1

2(  m2)  (    i m2

)  2b + ,

j = cb +  +  

where  and its conjugate  are bosonic ghosts, and we have added a nonminimal
term with boson  (conjugate ) and fermion  (conjugate ) to allow gauges general
enough for rst-quantization:

[, ] = [, ] = {, } = 1

for convenience, we also have chosen  (and ) to anti commute with ,

{, a} = {, a} = 0
to avoid having to replace i m2
with 1im; this has the natural interpretation of
treating  and  as bosonic (ghost) components of the  matrices (see subsections
xiia4-5,b5).

358

vi. quantum gauge theory

exercise via3.1

find q and j for spin 1 as constructed from the direct product of 2 spin 1/2s
(see exercise iib4.1d).

note that [q, ] = 0, but {q, a} 6=  for any a, so  is in the operator coho-
mology of q. normally, this would imply innite copies of the physical states in
the cohomology, since applying a translation with the ghost variable  gives a new
state in the cohomology from any given one. the nonminimal variables allow us to
avoid this problem by combining  with  to produce harmonic oscillator creation
and annihilation operators:

 = 12

(a + a),

 = 12

i(a  a),

 = 12

[a, a] = [a, a] = 1,

this allows us to dene a ground state

 =  12

i(a + a)

(a  a),
rest = 0

a|0i = a|0i = 0

which breaks the translation symmetry of . in chapter xii well show in a more
general framework how the q type of action then reproduces the dirac action.

4. fields

as described in subsection via2, we can perform gauge xing through brst,
including the introduction of ghosts, directly on the lagrangian at the classical level.
also, the brst transformations on the physical elds are just the gauge transforma-
tions with the gauge parameters replaced by ghosts, and the brst transformation on
the ghosts is quadratic in ghosts times the structure constants, while on the antighosts
it gives the nakanishi-lautrup elds, and it annihilates the nl elds. in the case of
yang-mills we then have

qaa = [a, c], qc = ic 2, q c = ib, qb = 0

while for matter transforming as  = i we have

q = ic

where we have used matrix notation for the group algebra, as usual. there are two
minor dierences from the transformation rules we used in our general discussion
previously: (1) we have included an extra i in our denition of the relativistic q,
for a convenience that will become apparent only when we relate relativistic rst- and

a. becchi-rouet-stora-tyutin

359

second-quantization (see chapter xii). (2) there is a relative sign dierence for qc
because now q is second-quantized while gi is still rst-quantized (i.e., matrices).
more explicitly, we have, e.g.,

c 2 = 1

2{c, c}  qc i =  1

2 c jc kfkj

i;

q = ic igi

the gauge-xed action is then the gauge-invariant action plus the brst trans-

formation of some function :

sgf = sgi  iq

for example, consider yang-mills in the most common type of gauge, where some
function of a is xed:

 = trz 1

2

c[f (a) + 1

2b] 
f
a  [, c]

2i c

2b]  1

lgf = lgi  1

2 b[f (a) + 1

for some constant . for  = 0, b is a lagrange multiplier, enforcing the gauge
f (a) = 0, while for  6= 0, we can eliminate b by its auxiliary eld equation:

2b[f (a) + 1
 1

2 b]  1

4f 2

examples will be given in the following section.

in eld theory gauge-xing functions always have linear terms, as do gauge trans-
formations. furthermore, there always exist unitary gauges, where no ghosts are
required. the ghost terms in general gauges serve simply to provide the appropriate
jacobian factor for the eld redenition that transforms from the general gauge to
the unitary gauge, which appears at the quantum level from functionally integrating
out the ghosts. the simplest example is the trivial gauge invariance that occurs in
the stuckelberg model:

qa = c,
which we can x with

q = c,

q c = ib,

qc = qb = 0

iq( co) = bo + i coc

for some eld-independent operator o. functionally integrating out b still sets  = 0,
but produces an inverse functional determinant of o (from redenition of , or from
(o)), canceled by that from integrating out the ghosts. the advantage of brst
is that all this can be treated at the classical level, in terms of the classical action,

360

vi. quantum gauge theory

without regard to functional integration, while directly giving a solution that can be
expressed immediately in terms of feynman rules.

exercise via4.1

show that the gauge xing

iq( co + cab + cb + ccb)

where o, a, b, and c are eld-independent operators, gives a result equivalent
to the previous, by considering functional determinants or eld redenitions.

exercise via4.2

show that the lagrangian

by the eld redenition

aab + cbd  aabd

d  d + b1b

for bosons a, b, c, d and operators a, b. this is the classical equivalent of
det(ab) = det(a)det(b).

these methods apply straightforwardly to supersymmetric theories in superspace:

from the gauge transformations of subsection ivc4,

qev = i cev  iev c;
q c = ib, q c = i b;

qc = ic 2, q c = i c 2

qb = q b = 0

where c, c, and b are chiral superelds, and c, c, and b their hermitian conjugates.

in practice, this brst approach is sucient for gauge xing. in particular, this
is true for the fundamental elds used in the standard model (including gravity),
which have spin2. therefore, well use mostly this approach in the rest of this text.
however, some observed hadrons have much higher spin. the rst-quantized approach
of chapter xii gives a natural and direct way of understanding ghosts and brst for
the elds describing such particles, and translates directly into the treatment of zinn-
justin, batalin, and vilkovisky (zjbv) for eld theory.

there are two important properties of gauges we have examined: (1) gauges
which eliminate some degrees of freedom, such as lightcone or unitary gauges, are
simpler classically, which makes them easier to understand physically. (2) gauges that
manifest as many global invariances as possible, such as the fermi-feynman gauge,
will be found later to simplify quantum calcuations, because the explicit momentum
dependence of the propagator or vertices is simpler, and keeping a symmetry manifest
makes it unnecessary to check. in this section well examine these gauges in greater
detail, especially as they relate to intereacting theories.

well study also some special gauges, with nontrivial interaction terms, that have
both of these properties to some extent. in particular, they are manifestly lorentz
covariant, but avoid many of the complications associated with ghosts.

1. radial

we know from nonrelativistic classical and quantum mechanics that the equations
of motion can be solved exactly only for certain simple external eld congurations.
one particular case we have already emphasized is that of an action quadratic in the
dynamical variables, i.e., the harmonic oscillator and its generalizations. higher-order
terms are then treated as perturbations about the exact solution. such an expansion
in the coordinates x is the particle version of the jwkb expansion in h: calling the

classical part of x y, we substitute x  y + hx and taylor expand in x. (from

now on well drop the hs, and just remember to perturb about the quadratic terms.)
for the scalar eld we write

   + x   + 1

2xmxnmn + ...

where ... is implicitly evaluated at y.

for the gauge elds we would like to be a bit more clever: for example, for the
electromagnetic potential am we know we can always add a constant, so am(y) is
irrelevant, while for a only fmn = [man] is gauge invariant. this means we want to
choose a gauge best suited to this calculation: a gauge that both eliminates as many
as possible of the lower-order terms, and expresses a(y + x) in terms of only f (y)
and its derivatives. similarly, we should have a taylor expansion for charged elds
in terms of covariant derivatives. the appropriate gauge, which easily can be found
explicitly, is the radial gauge

x  a(y + x) = 0

b. gauges

363

(note that, unlike f , a depends on x independently of y, not just as y + x, since the
gauge condition itself is x-dependent. we write a(y + x) only to indicate that a is
evaluated at position y + x.) one way to solve this condition is to use the identity

xnfnm = (x   + 1)am  [m, x  a]

( = /x)

which follows from the denition of f . using the gauge condition, we then can write

am =

1

x   + 1

xnfnm

alternatively, we can replace x everywhere (including the argument y + x) by  x, and
then identify x   =  / to nd

 xnfnm(y +  x) =   am(y +  x)

integrating both sides over  from 0 to 1, we nd

am(y + x) =z 1

0

d  xnfnm(y +  x)

note in particular that a(y) = 0.

another way to dene this gauge is to consider gauge covariant translation from
y to y + x to produce a gauge transformation from an arbitrary gauge to the radial
gauge. writing the covariant derivative at y as

d = d + ia(y),

d = /y

we know from subsection iiic2 that

(y + x)  exd(y) = eiexd(y) = ei(y + x)

so that covariant translation produces a (y + x) that is the same as (y + x) up to
a gauge transformation. thus the gauge-transformed  can be written as a covariant
taylor expansion (for purposes of perturbation) about y:

(x + y) =

xn=0

1

n! xa1    xan(da1   dan)(y)

in particular, (y) = (y).

however, we want to dene a covariant derivative with respect to x (not y), so

that

 =  + ia(x + y),

(y + x) = (d)(y + x) = exd(d)(y)

364

using

we nd the solution

vi. quantum gauge theory

(y) = 0

 = exddexd mod exdexd

where the latter term vanishes on (y + x), so the right amount of it can be added
to the former expression to cancel any d terms. the result is

 = exd( + d)exd

this implies x  a(y + x) = 0 directly: contracting both sides with x, the taylor
expansion of the right-hand side terminates after the rst couple of terms. taylor
expanding the uncontracted expression, we have

aa(y + x) =

xn=0

1
n!

1

n+2(x  d)nxbfba(y)

we can also write

 + ia(x + y) =  = exdexd[ + ia(x + y)]exdexd = ei[ + ia(x + y)]ei
and

 = exdeydeyexd

exercise vib1.1

show this taylor expansion is equivalent to that obtained from the rst
method used in this section to solve the gauge condition. (hint: look out for
hidden x and y dependence  how does x   on  or f  relate to x  d?
also beware of notation: in the rst construction we did not use a gauge
transformation, so no primes were used.)

thus, to just quadratic order in x, the mechanics action for a relativistic particle

in external elds (subsection iiib3) becomes

sl z d{ 1

2 v1mn

.
xm .

xn + 1
2

.
xmxnfnm(y)

+v[(y) + xm(m)(y) + 1

2xmxn(mn)(y)]}

to this approximation the classical equations of motion are linear and can be solved
exactly. it can also be used to nd exact solutions for constant electromagnetic elds.

b. gauges

365

2. lorentz

for purposes of explicit calculations in perturbation theory, its more convenient
to use gauges where lorentz covariance is manifest. lorentz gauges are a class of
gauges using

(and similarly for other gauge elds) as the gauge-xing function. from the discussion
of subsection via4, we have from the usual brst as applied to yang-mills

in particular, for  = 1 we have the fermi-feynman gauge, which gives the nicest
propagators. (it is also the gauge that follows automatically from a rst-quantized
brst construction, which will be described in chapter xii.) more generally, we nd
the propagator from inverting the kinetic operator: for the ghosts this is always 2/p2,
but for aa,

2[abp2 + ( 1

  1)papb]1 = 2(cid:20)ab

p2 + (  1)

papb

(p2)2(cid:21)

for  = 0 this is the landau gauge, which has the advantage that the propagator
is proportional to the transverse projection operator. (it kills terms proportional to
pa.) however,  = 1 is clearly the simplest, and the 1/p4 term can cause problems in
perturbation theory.

exercise vib2.1

in the abelian case, consider making a gauge transformation on the gauge-
xed action (including matter), with   1b. show that the only eect
is to change the value of the coecient  of the b2 term. find a similar
transformation for the form of the action where b has been eliminated. this
shows explicitly the decoupling of the longitudinal mode of the photon.

(aba + papbb)1 =

a(cid:18)ab  papb

a + p2b(cid:19)

366

vi. quantum gauge theory

note that in the abelian case the lightcone gauge is a special case of the landau
gauge. (an analogous situation occurs in the classical mechanics of the particle for
the gauges of the worldline metric, as discussed in subsection iiib2.) here we have

0 = na(bfab) = n  (  a)  (n  a)

in the lightcone formalism, this is the eld equation that comes from varying the
auxiliary eld. in the lightcone gauge n  a = 0, it implies   a = 0 (and thus also
aa = 0), since n   is invertible.
this is particularly useful in d=4, where we can generalize from the lightcone to

a lorentz-covariant form by using twistors: from subsection iib6,

.,
p2 = 0  p . = (p0)p p

.
n2 = 0  n . = (n0)nn

massless spinors are described on shell in momentum space by

 = p,

. = p


. 

where external-line factors for feynman diagrams are given by setting  = 1. for
massless vectors, we have p  a = n  a = 0 (but n  p 6= 0), so depending on whether
the helicity is +1 (self-dual eld strength) or 1 (anti-self-dual eld strength), we
nd, respectively,

.

the normalization of a has been chosen compatible with || = 1 and aaa*a = 1 for
evaluating cross sections. in a general landau gauge the arbitrary gauge-dependent
. can be chosen independently for each external line, since
polarization spinors n, n
gauge invariance means independent gauge parameters for dierent momenta. (this
method is known as spinor helicity.) however, in a lightcone gauge the polarization
spinors are constant.

the lightcone gauge condition is thus again a stronger gauge condition than
lorentz gauges, as expected from the fact that it has fewer derivatives. this dif-
ference shows itself in various ways:

(1) in perturbation theory on shell, in the lightcone frame the landau gauge condition
0 = p a = p+a kills a but says nothing about a+, which can be eliminated
by the residual gauge invariance a+ = p+ to obtain the lightcone gauge.

b. gauges

367

(2) in perturbation theory o shell, more derivatives in the gauge transformation
imply more derivatives in the ghost kinetic operator. thus, more ghost degrees
of freedom are introduced to cancel the extra unphysical degrees of freedom in
the gauge eld.

(3) lorentz gauges also have a nonperturbative ambiguity (the gribov ambiguity)
that axial gauges avoid: nonperturbative solutions to the gauge condition can be
found that dier from the perturbative one, in the nonabelian case. specically,
it is possible to nd a nontrivial gauge transformation g ( = g1g) such that

0 =   a = i  g1(g)

f or   a = 0

even when g is required to satisfy boundary conditions that it approach the
identity at innity (except in the abelian case, where g = ei   = 0   =
0). this is not the case for axial gauges, where

0 = n  a = n  g1(g)
by simply integrating from innity.

f or n  a = 0  g1(n  g) = 0  g = i

3. massive

in subsection iib4 we described the introduction of mass for the vector by dimen-
sional reduction, giving the stuckelberg formalism for a massive (abelian) gauge eld.
the gauge-invariant action (subsection iva5) and brst transformation laws (sub-
section via4) followed from adding an extra dimension and setting the corresponding
component of the momentum equal to the mass:

lgi = 1

4(maa + a)2

8f 2

ab + 1

qaa = ac, q = mc, q c = ib, qb = 0

where the scalar is the extra component of the vector.

there are two obvious covariant gauges for such a vector: (1) the unitary gauge

f = 

simply gauges away the scalar. since the scalar has a nonderivative gauge transfor-
mation, the ghosts do not propagate: the gauge-xing term

iq( c) = b + im cc

368

vi. quantum gauge theory

simply eliminates the scalar and ghosts as auxiliary elds. the net result is that we
could have simply chosen

gauge  = 0

and ignored ghosts because of s nonderivative transformation law. thus the gauge-
xed lagrangian is just the result of adding a mass term to the massless lagrangian:

lgf = 1

8f 2

ab + 1

4 m2a2

but the propagator is

2[ab(p2 + m2)  papb]1 = 2(cid:20)

ab

p2 + m2 +

papb

m2(p2 + m2)(cid:21)

notice that the second term is higher in derivatives than the rst; this can cause some
technical problems in perturbation theory.

(2) the fermi-feynman gauge works similarly to the massless case. we then

modify the gauge-xing function to

f =   a + m

so

iq[ 1

2

c(  a + m + 1

2 b)] =  1

2 b(  a + m + 1

4 a  (  m2)a  1

4(  a + m)2  1

2 i c(  m2)c

4(  m2)  1

2i c(  m2)c

the propagators are again simpler. the vector has d propagating components instead
of just the d1 physical ones; the 2 ghosts cancel  and the extra component in a.

this shows explicitly the second unphysical bosonic mode of mass  to cancel

c look at the cases

these two choices of gauge also exist for yang-mills theories exhibiting the higgs
mechanism, since those models give the stuckelberg model when linearized about
the vacuum values of the elds. the advantages are the same: the unitary gauge
eliminates as many unphysical degrees of freedom as possible (see subsection iva6
for an example), while the fermi-feynman gauge gives the simplest propagators.

exercise vib3.2

work out the fermi-feynman gauge for an arbitrary higgs model, generalizing
the analysis for the stuckelberg case.

4. gervais-neveu

we next consider pure yang-mills theory for the gauge group u(n), but use a

complex gauge-xing function

f0 =   a + ia2

where aa is a vector of hermitian nn matrices, and a2  aaaa. (the hermitian
conjugate, i  i, gives similar results.) the gauge-xed lagrangian (in the action

s = g2trr l) is then

where  acts on c as if it were in the dening representation (i.e., c = c + iac,
not [a, c]). this gervais-neveu gauge already has the simplication that some of
the terms in the yang-mills self-interaction have been canceled.

exercise vib4.1

consider the anti-gervais-neveu gauge, where the same gauge-xing term
is added with opposite overall sign.

a show the resulting lagrangian can be written as

la  tr[(/a/ + ia/ 2)2]

where the trace is with respect to both (nn) internal and (44) dirac
matrices. thus, spin can be treated in a manner closely analogous to internal
symmetry.

b show the propagator can be written in the form of the product of 2 (massless)

dirac-spinor propagators.

c starting with the complex rst-order formulation of yang-mills of subsection
iiic4, show that the action can be written in a way that replaces the above
44 matrices with 22 matrices, as

la  tr[ g2 + g(a* + iaa*)]

in rst-order form, where now g is neither traceless nor symmetric in spinor
indices (its trace is the nakanishi-lautrup eld), or in second-order form as

la  tr[(a* + iaa*)2]

(note that this diers from the above dirac form, as expanded in 22 matri-
ces, because it includes the chern-simons term.)

next, consider a model where the yang-mills elds couple to scalars that are also
represented by nn matrices, but that are in the dening (n-component) represen-
tation of the gauge (color) u(n), while also being in the dening representation of
a second, global (avor) u(n). (see subsection iva6.) this complex eld thus has
2n2 real components compared to the n2 gauge vectors, and the 2n2 ghosts. we also
choose a higgs potential such that the masses of the scalar and vector come out the
same (but we can also specialize to the massless case). the scalar lagrangian is then
(again with g2tr in the action)

l =  1

2 2 + 1

4r2,

r =   1

2m2

finally, we modify the gauge-xing function to

f = f0 + ir

with this choice, the ghost terms are unmodied (r is gauge invariant), but the
scalar self-interaction is completely canceled (including the mass term). the total
lagrangian is then

l = (la + 1

4 m2a2) + ( 1

2 2 + i 1

2 f0) + i( 1

c2c + i 1

b. gauges

since the scalar lagrangian is identical in form to that of the ghosts, and neither
has self-interactions, functional integration over them will produce canceling func-
tional determinants, because they have opposite statistics. this is a reection of the
fact that both sets of elds now describe unphysical polarizations, since both describe
massless states in a theory where all physical states are massive (as seen, e.g., in a
unitary gauge). this has the great advantage that, for this particular model, both
the scalar elds and the ghosts can be dropped altogether, while the lagrangian

l  la + 1

4m2a2

completely describes the physical massive vector and scalar states. this was possible
only because of the use of a complex gauge condition: the longitudinal component of
the vector is now imaginary, which xes the wrong sign associated with the minkowski
metric. a related characteristic of this gauge is that we nowhere needed to change
the vacuum value of any eld, unlike other gauges for actions where there is a higgs
eect.

we now note that this result for the massive case (and its massless limit) actually
can be obtained more easily than the result for the pure yang-mills case: since the
nal result has no ghosts, it is in a unitary gauge, where the vector not only eats
the usual compensating scalar, but overeats by absorbing the physical scalar. the
appropriate gauge condition is still complex and involves the scalars, but is now linear :

gauge  = hi = 12

mi

where , treated as independent, is unxed. (as for the usual unitary gauge im  =
0, i.e.,  = , there are no propagating ghosts, since the gauge transformation of 
has no derivatives.) in this gauge the action becomes quadratic in :

l   1

2 i(  a + ia2) 12

m + 1

4( 12

m  1

2m2)2

in fact,  appears as an auxiliary eld (taking the place of the nakanishi-lautrup
eld), so we can eliminate it by its equation of motion:


   = m2

+

2
m if0  l = la + 1

4m2a2

this procedure is analogous to that used for the lightcone gauge, where one compo-
nent of the gauge eld is xed and one is eliminated as an auxiliary eld: a closer
analogy will be found in subsection vib6.

of course, such gauges generalize to other higgs models, but results will not be

as simple when the vector and scalar masses dier:

372

vi. quantum gauge theory

exercise vib4.2

make the coecient of the r2 term in l arbitrary, so the masses of the
vector and scalar are unequal, but choose the same gauge  = hi. find the
propagator, and compare with that of exercise vib3.1.

5. super gervais-neveu

nonhermitian gauges are also useful in supersymmetric theories: here we consider
the supersymmetric analog of the massive model of the previous section. although
we work in n=1 superspace, the model turns out to automatically have an n=2
supersymmetry. just as the bosonic model ended with only a vector eld describing
only physical polarizations, we now want a real scalar supereld to have only physical
polarizations. since such a supereld has 8 bosonic components and 8 fermionic, while
massless n=1 multiplets have 2+2 physical polarizations, we need 1 vector multiplet
plus 3 scalar multiplets. since the bosonic model had a complex scalar representation,
2 of these scalar multiplets must form the analogous dening  dening representation
of local  global groups, so the last must be a real (adjoint) representation of the

local group. the model is then given by (where again s = g2 trr dx l)
lgi = z d2 w 2 z d4 (ev 0ev 0 + +ev + + ev )

(cid:20)z d2 (+  1

4 m2)0 + h.c.(cid:21)

where we have included the only possible scale-invariant potential term, and intro-
duced a higgs mechanism by an n=2 fayet-iliopoulos term, which we chose to write
in terms of the chiral scalar. (see subsection ivc7.)

the brst transformations (which also imply the gauge transformations) for this

action are (see subsection via4)

qev = i cev  iev c,
qc = ic 2, q c = i c 2;

qev = ev (qev )ev = icev  iev c
q c = ib, q c = i b;
q0 = i[c, 0],

qb = q b = 0

q = ic
q  = i c 
our nonhermitian choice for the brst gauge-xing function is

q+ = ic+,
q + = i + c,

q 0 = i[ c, 0],

 = z d2 c( d2ev + 0) z d2  c(d2ev + 0)

b. gauges

373

note that ev is an element of the algebra as well as a nonunitary element of the
group, only because we chose the group u(n) (as was the case for a2 in the bosonic
version). the gauge-xing and ghost terms are then

iq = z d2 b( d2ev + 0) +z d2  b(d2ev + 0)

z d4 ( cev c + cev c) +z d2 c c0 +z d2  c c 0

where we have used the eld equation enforced by the lagrange multipliers b and
b (or, equivalently, made eld redenitions of the lagrange multipliers to generate
terms proportional to their constraints).

exercise vib5.1

make a component analysis of this theory:

a expand the gauge-invariant action in components.

b do the same for the gauge-xing terms.

c compare the bosonic part of both the gauge-invariant and gauge-xed actions

to those of the previous subsection, after elimination of auxiliary elds.

we now see that the ghost terms are identical in form to those for , under the

identication

(+, , +, )  (c, c, c, c)

(but beware signs from ordering of ghosts). so again the ghosts cancel the (n=2)
matter elds, leaving only the n=2 vector multiplet. but we can also eliminate
the n=1 matter half of this n=2 multiplet using the nakanishi-lautrup lagrange
multiplers: the nal simple result for the gauge-xed action is thus

l = z d2 w 2 z d4 [ev (d2ev )ev d2ev + 1

4m2(ev + ev )]

a further simplication results from the redenition (again possible only for u(n))

ev  1 + v

this also simplies the brst (and gauge) transformation for v :

qv = i( c  c) + i( cv  v c)

whose linear form resembles the bosonic case. using the expression (see exercise
ivc4.1)

w = i d2ev dev  i d2

1 + v

dv

374

for the eld strength, the lagrangian becomes

although the nonabelian vector multiplet has nonpolynomial self-interactions in
any gauge, this gauge simplies the lower-point interactions, which are the ones more
frequently used for a xed number of external lines. expanding this action to cubic
order, we use the identity

d d2d = d

.d2 d . =  1

2 + {d2, d2}

for the kinetic term, and

d .d2 = d2 d . + i .d

for the gauge-xing part of the cubic term, with integration by parts. (for the gauge-
invariant term, some work can be saved by using the equivalent w
form.) the result
is

l =z d4 { 1

not only are there fewer terms than with linear gauge conditions, but these terms have
fewer spinor derivatives, which yields viewer nonvanishing contributions in loops (see
subsection vic5). as for the bosonic model of the previous subsection, this analysis
also applies for the unbroken case m = 0.

(hint: use d4 =r d4 e d. warning: if derived by fourier transformation,

the integral is infrared divergent, and requires dropping an innite constant.)

6. spacecone

we have just seen that gauge independence allows complex gauge conditions,
which make the action complex. (in subsection iiic4, we also used complex auxiliary
elds, with a similar eect.) in this subsection we introduce a complex analog of the
lightcone, the spacecone, which will greatly simplify feynman diagram calculations
with massless elds. the spacecone gauge condition is

a2  ia3 = 0

or more generally

n  a = 0,

n2 = 0,

n  n* > 0

(but only na, not n*a, appears in the action). while this gauge is spacelike (in the
sense that only spatial components of the gauge eld are xed), it is also null, by
virtue of being complex. thus, although algebraically like the lightcone, it allows
canonical quantization with the usual time coordinate.
in fact, it is just a wick
rotation of the lightcone. we then eliminate a2 + ia3 as an auxiliary eld.

the spacecone is a new gauge to add to our list of axial gauges n  a = 0 from
subsection iiic2, and the related gauges for scalars from subsections iva5-6, vib3-4:

axial gauges

non-null

null (+ auxiliary f ield eq.)

(partly) temporal

timelike : a0 = 0
arnowitt-f ickler : a1 = 0

lightcone : a+ = 0, /a
spacecone : at = 0, / at
unitary :  =  gervais-neveu :  = hi, /

in fact, at least for the free theories, the gauges for the scalars can be considered
as dimensional reductions (from 1 or 2 extra dimensions) of those for the vector, as
used for deriving the stuckelberg formalism in subsection iib4, where the spacelike
components of the vector associated with gauge xing become scalars: arnowitt-
fickler  unitary, spacecone  gervais-neveu.

376

vi. quantum gauge theory

the main advantages of the spacecone over the lightcone are special to d=4, so
we now review the lightcone in a way specialized to physical spacetime. we rst
repeat the results of subsection iiic2, relabeling the indices appropriately. starting
with the gauge condition (see subsections ia4 and iia3 for notation)

and eliminating at by its eld equation, the lagrangian for pure yang-mills becomes

at = 0

l = a+t ta  1

4(f +)2 + 1

4(f tt)2

f + = +a  a+ + i[a+, a]
f tt = a+ + +a + i

1
t ([a+, ta] + [a, ta+])

we simplify the lagrangian by using the self-dual and anti-self-dual combinations:
dropping also the t superscripts on  for simplicity,

2(f tt  f +) = a + i
f = 1
l = a+ a + f +f

label all the elds and derivatives in the above forms of the lagrangian, f
in particular, in spinor notation.

exercise vib6.2

show that the eld redenitions a  ()1, when applied to just the rst
two terms of the above lagrangian, produce a local action describing the self-
dual eld equations of the lightcone formalism of subsection iiic5 (taking into
account the dierence between the lightcone and spacecone). compare the
results of exercise iiic5.2. thus, by treating the latter two terms separately
from the former two, yang-mills can be treated as a perturbation about self-
dual yang-mills.

another simplication for massless d=4, and closely related to the use of helicity,
is twistors. for our feynman diagram calculations for spins  1, almost all spinor
algebra involves objects carrying at most two spinor indices (spinors, vectors, self-dual
tensors), so we use the twistor matrix notation of subsection iib6. in particular, in a

b. gauges

377

general class of gauges the external line factors for yang-mills elds in this notation
(see subsection vib2) read

for + helicity or

a = + = |i[p|

hpi  f *  |p][p|,

f = 0

a =  = |pi[|

[p]  f  |pihp|,

f * = 0

for , where ()a are the polarization 4-vectors for helicity 1 in terms of a twistor
., which can vary from line to line, and whose choice denes the gauge, as a special
, 
case of the landau gauge. (positive helicity is the same as self-duality, negative is
anti-self-dual. the landau gauge condition is generally applied in arbitrary lorentz
gauges to external lines, to eliminate the redundant longitudinal degrees of freedom.)

one special case is the lightcone gauge

n  a = 0, n = |i[|

in terms of an arbitrary constant lightlike vector n. a more convenient gauge is the
spacecone gauge, which can be written in terms of two twistors:

n = |+i[|

these two twistors are sucient to dene a complete reference frame: we can convert
all spinor indices into this basis, as

 = 



etc. this corresponds to using two lightlike vectors to dene the spacecone gauge,
n = |i[|. for simplicity, we write |i = |i; then a vector in this basis can be
written as

p = p+|+i[+| + p|i[| + pt|i[+| + pt|+i[|

if we use the normalization

h+i = [+] = 1

e.g., for massless momentum p = |pi[p|,
p = h+pi[p+],

p+ = hpi[p],

pt = h+pi[p],

pt = hpi[p+]

we will also drop the superscript t in contexts where there is no ambiguity. this
basis is related to our previous spinor basis up to phase factors, |i  |i, |]  | .
],


378

vi. quantum gauge theory

and we assume them to be commuting (rather than anticommuting); these changes
are more convenient for dealing with twistors (commuting spinors).

the advantage of the spacecone is that we can lorentz covariantize the feyn-
man rules by identifying these two lightlike vectors with physical on-shell massless
momenta. we need two such reference vectors because we are not allowed to have
n = p on any line. since only |+i appears in the external line factors for helicity
+1, and only |] in those for 1, the simplest choice is to pick the momentum of
one external line with helicity +1 to dene |] for all lines with helicity 1, and pick
the momentum of one line with helicity 1 to dene |+i for lines with helicity +1.
(in the presence of massless external spinors, we can also choose a helicity +1/2 line
to dene |], etc.) our above normalization means that we have chosen the phase
h+i/[+] = 1 as allowed by the usual ambiguity of twistor phases, while our choice
of the magnitude h+i[+] = h+|[+|  |i|] = 1 is a choice of (mass) units. in
explicit calculations, we restore generality (in particular, to allow momentum integra-
tion) by inserting appropriate powers of h+i and [+] at the end of the calculations,
as determined by simple dimensional and helicity analysis. (this avoids a clutter of

normalization factorsph+i[+] at intermediate stages.) for example, looking at

the form of the usual spinor helicity external line factors, and counting momenta in
the usual feynman rules, we see that any tree amplitude (or individual graph) in pure
yang-mills must go as

h i2e+[ ]2e

where e is the number of external lines with helicity .

we now return to external line factors. the naive factors for the above lagrangian
are 1, since the kinetic term resembles that of a scalar. however, this would lead to
unusual normalization factors in probabilities, which are not obvious in this complex
gauge. therefore, we determine external line factors from the earlier spinor helicity
expressions for external 4-vectors. in lorentz gauges ()a would be the polarization
for helicity 1 for the complete 4-vector, but in the spacecone formalism only a
appear. furthermore, in the spacecone we nd

(+) = |+i[+|  |+i[p|
h+pi
()+ = |i[|  |pi[|
[p]

= 0

= 0

since by antisymmetry h++i = [] = 0, so that a+ carries only helicity +1 and
a only 1. (this statement has literal meaning only on shell, but we can make this

b. gauges

379

convenient identication more general by using it as a denition of helicity o shell.)
the appropriate external line factors for these elds are thus

(+)+ = |i[|  |+i[p|
h+pi
() = |+i[+|  |pi[|
[p]

=

[p]
h+pi
= h+pi
[p]

note that these factors are inverses of each other, consistent with leaving invariant
(the inner product dened by) the kinetic term.

an exception is the external line factors for the reference momenta themselves,
where |pi = |i for helicity  gives vanishing results. however, examination of the
lagrangian shows this zero can be canceled by a 1/ in a vertex, since p = p = 0 for
the reference momenta by denition. (such cancelations occur automatically from
eld redenitions in the lightcone formulation of the self-dual theory.) the actual
expressions we want to evaluate, before choosing the reference lines, are then

p

p+

(+)+ = h+pi[p+]
h+pi[p]
() = hpi[p]
h+pi[p]

[p]
h+pi
h+pi
[p]

=

[p+]
h+pi
= hpi
[p]

evaluating the former at |pi = |i and the latter at |pi = |+i, we get 1 in both cases.
in summary, for reference lines: (1) use only the 3-point vertex of the corresponding
self-duality (   for helicity ), and use only the term associating the singular
factor with the reference line (the other term and the other vertices give vanishing
contributions); (2) including the momentum factors on that line from the vertex, the
external line factor is 1.

7. superspacecone

to generalize these results to high-energy (massless) qcd, we consider supersym-
metric qcd, i.e., yang-mills coupled to massless fermions in the adjoint representa-
tion. for tree graphs, this is equivalent to ordinary massless qcd except for group
theory, which can be evaluated separately. we rst apply the spacecone approach to
the component action for supersymmetric qcd: the modication of this action for
ordinary massless qcd is trivial (replacing the adjoint quark current with dening).
from this we derive the superspacecone formalism, rewriting the action more sim-
ply in terms of spacecone superelds. (this form can also be derived from the usual
superspace, but we will not consider that here.)

380

vi. quantum gauge theory

we now combine the spacecone approach to pure yang-mills of subsection vib6
with the spacecone version of the lightcone treatment of the massless spinor in sub-
section iiic2. we modify the lightcone to the spacecone for the quarks by instead
.
eliminating  and 
 as auxiliary. for later convenience, we also write the remaining
fermionic elds as

.

  +,

  

then we directly nd the terms in the lagrangian

l = a+ a + f +f + i+(    1
f = a  1

+)
 ([a,ia] + {+, })

where the quark term in f comes from the quark coupling to at when using its
equation of motion to solve for f tt. collecting terms, we have

l = l2 + l3 + l4

l4 = ([a+,ia]+{+, })
[a, +]
where terms with  have only a single sum over it. although this lagrangian is
much messier than the original covariant one, one again saves work by expanding
terms once in the action rather than repeatedly for each feynman diagram.

i

external-line factors for the spinors follow from the covariant ones of subsection

vib2 as they did for the spacecone vectors of subsection vib6. we thus have

+ = [p],

 = h+pi

compared with those for a, we see + has an extra factor of p = h+pi[p] as
compared with a+a, as expected from the extra factor of 1/(i) in the kinetic
operator. similarly, if we choose to use external quark lines as reference lines, we use

p

+ = [p+],

which also reduce to 1 for the appropriate reference momenta.

noting that the bosonic and fermionic terms are the same except for factors of

(no sum on ). these spinor derivatives (and their corresponding supersymmetry
generators) describe only spatial supersymmetry, since they contain no time deriva-

tives. then, using the identity

dd[, ]| = [a,ia] + {+, }

we easily combine the terms in the lagrangian l into the superspacecone lagrangian
l:

introduce another pair of chiral superelds as auxiliary. show the above

kinetic term resembles the covariant one for a massless spinor, while the inter-
action term contains no derivatives and is only cubic. (hint: dd/(i) are
projection operators for chiral superelds.) thus this lagrangian resembles

the chern-simons one that appears on the 3d boundary for the topological

term in yang-mills (see subsection iiic6). expand the action in components,

and separate out the pure yang-mills part.

action identical to the nonsupersymmetric one obtained there, except for the

r d+. expand in components, and relate to the nonsupersymmetric case.

382

vi. quantum gauge theory

8. background-eld

a more general type of gauge choice is the background eld gauge. as we saw
in subsection vc1, the generating functional can be written in a form where the
quantum eld is expanded about a background eld in the interaction part of the
classical action. the basic steps of the background eld gauge method are:

(1) choose gauge xing that is gauge invariant in the background gauge eld,

(2) show that the quantum/background splitting of the entire gauge-invariant action

is also gauge invariant in the background gauge eld, and

(3) show that the eect of splitting the kinetic term in the gauge-invariant action can

be neglected. (only the interaction terms should have been split.)

the result is then that the eective action  , which depends only on the background
elds, is gauge invariant in them. this gauge invariance is a strong condition which
not only simplies the eective action but allows a background gauge to be chosen
for it that is independent of the quantum gauge applied to the path integral: the
background elds and quantum elds can be in dierent gauges. for example, for a
relativistic treatment of the quantum corrections to bound states whose constitutents
are nonrelativistic (such as the hydrogen atom), it is convenient to use a fermi-
feynman gauge (convenient for relativistic matter coupling to electromagnetism or
chromodynamics) for the quantum elds and a coulomb gauge (convenient for static
or nonrelativistic matter) for the background elds.

a simple way to formulate the background expansion is in terms of the covariant

derivative:

a  a = a + a    d + ia,

d =  + ia

where a is the quantum eld (the variable of path integration) and d is the back-
ground covariant derivative in terms of the background eld a. we then nd for
the eld strength

fab  i[da + iaa,db + iab] = fab + d[aab] + i[aa, ab]

and similarly for the action. matter elds are split as usual,

   =  + 

we now have two gauge invariances, corresponding to the two gauge elds. both
transformations are dened to have the same, usual form on  = d + ia (and on

b. gauges

383

 =  + ), and thus both leave the action inert, but (1) the background gauge
invariance is dened to transform the background elds covariantly

background :

d = eidei

( = ei),

 = eiei

(  = ei )

 a = eiaei

( = ei)

and thus the quantum eld transforms as a matter (non-gauge) eld, while (2) the
quantum gauge invariance is dened to leave the background elds inert

quantum :

d = d ( = ),
 a = ei[(id + a)ei]

(  = ei )

 = eiei
[ = ei( + )  ]

the latter then determines the new brst transformations

qaa = [da + iaa, c], qc = ic 2, q c = ib, qb = 0

[q = ic( + )]

the key to the background eld gauge is to break the quantum invariance, so
a propagator can be dened, but preserve the background invariance, so the path
integral is gauge invariant. since q, the brst operator for the quantum gauge
invariance, is now background gauge invariant, we need only choose a gauge-xing
function  that is also background gauge invariant. many gauges are possible: the
basic rule is to modify any normal gauge condition simply by replacing any partial
derivatives  with background covariant derivatives d. for example, for a lorentz
covariant gauge

  a  d  a

we then gauge x in the usual way, and now the gauge-xing terms and the ghost
terms are background gauge invariant, as long as we dene the ghosts to transform
covariantly:

background :

c = eicei,

c = ei cei,

b = eibei

for example, for lorentz gauges the ghost term is modied, by the modication of
the gauge condition and the quantum brst transformation, as

c  c  cd2c + cd  i[a, c]

furthermore, even axial gauges are modied: for example, even though the gauge
condition a0 = 0 allows elimination of a component of the quantum eld, it doesnt
aect the background eld, which now appears in the ghost lagrangian

vi. quantum gauge theory

since the s-matrix is gauge-independent (when brst is used to perform gauge
xing, as we have), we can use the background eld gauge version of the generating
functional (now using  to represent all quantum elds and  all background),

z[] =z d ei s,

s = s0[] + si[ + ]  iq[, ] = s  (s0[ + ]  s0[])

s = s[ + ]  iq,

s[] = s0[] + si[]

where s[] is the original gauge-invariant action, q is the gauge-xing as de-
scribed above, and s is the sum of this gauge xing and the background-expanded
gauge-invariant action. we have thus separated the total action s appearing in the
background-gauge-xed generating functional into the background-gauge-invariant
part s minus the noninvariant terms s0[ + ]  s0[].

as usual, the classical part of the eective action  [] is given by adding the
kinetic term s0[] of the (gauge-invariant) classical action to the 1pi tree graphs,
which are just the vertices for the background elds. (the q term doesnt contribute
because it has no pure background piece.) thus,

class[] = s|=0 + s0[] = s|=0 = s[]

we now note that, as far as calculating just the eective action is concerned,
we can drop all terms in the gauge-xed action independent of or linear in : any
independent term contributes only classically; any linear term will generate one-
particle reducible graphs (tadpoles). this means we can drop the noninvariant
terms s0[ + ]  s0[] from s. thus, the feynman rules for calculating  are:
(1) use the classical gauge-invariant action s[] for the classical contribution to  ;
and (2) for the quantum contribution, use all the 1pi loop graphs coming from s.
the result is background gauge invariant, since s is manifestly so.

another important feature of the quantum-gauge-xed background eld action is
that it is background-gauge-invariant order-by-order in the quantum elds. in fact,
every term in the corresponding ordinary gauge action has been replaced by one (or
more, if there are f terms) background-gauge-invariant term.

exercise vib8.1

consider the fermi-feynman background-eld gauge for the quantum eld
of pure yang-mills theory. write all terms (both gauge-invariant and gauge-
xed) quadratic in the quantum eld. show that these combine as

where = (d)2 (and da means [d, a], etc.).

since all external lines are associated with background elds, if we draw graphs
in such a way as to exhibit only the quantum elds, they will all look like vacuum
graphs: graphs with no external lines. however, any particular such vacuum graph
will represent many of the original graphs, since the background lines can be attached
in many ways. furthermore, in background eld gauges any such vacuum graph, con-
sidered as a contribution to the eective action, will be gauge invariant with respect
to the background gauge transformations, since it results from the non-background
gauge true vacuum graph by the replacement of the ordinary derivative with the
background covariant derivative   d (plus perhaps some noniminimal f terms),
including in the propagator. in particular, the complete one-loop contribution to 
is given by the vacuum graph with no quantum interactions: it can be obtained from
just the part of the s that is quadratic in the quantum elds.

exercise vib8.2

consider an arbitrary gauge-invariant yang-mills action s[ a] with a = a+a
in terms of the background eld a and quantum eld a. taylor expand the
action in a as

s[ a] = s[a] + a

s[a]
a

+ ...

the innitesimal quantum gauge transformation mixes dierent-order terms
in the expansion. show that the term quadratic in a is invariant under an
abelian quantum gauge transformation only if the background satises the
eld equations, s[a]/a = 0. similar remarks apply to brst transforma-
tions and the gauge-xed action. (since quadratic actions, even in background
elds, yield only a propagator, they can be described by rst-quantization:
thus gauge invariance implying background eld equations occurs whenever
a gauge eld appears as both a quantum mechanical state and a background
eld, for example in string theory. see subsection xiib7 for a simpler exam-
ple.)

the s-matrix is then given in the usual way from  [], after adding another
gauge-xing term for the background gauge invariance. since the total s-matrix is

386

vi. quantum gauge theory

given by just the trees following from treating  as a classical action, we need only

a gauge-xing term for the physical elds, and we can ignore background ghosts.

(of course, quantum ghosts were already used to calculate  .) this background

gauge xing is independent of the quantum gauge xing. in particular, we can choose

dierent quantum and background gauges: for example, when treating spontaneously

broken gauge theories, its often more convenient to choose a fermi-feynman quantum

gauge and a unitary background gauge; i.e., we expand the background elds about

the physical vacuum to make the physical states obvious, but leave the quantum

elds unexpanded to avoid complicating the feynman rules. this also avoids the

complication of having to expand about the vacuum twice, since vacuum values get

quantum corrections to those appearing in the classical action.

the gauge invariance of the eective action in the background-eld formalism is

a big advantage over other quantum gauges, where the eective action is only brst

invariant, since gauge invariance is a much stronger constraint than brst invariance:

gauge symmetry is local, while brst is only global. thus, the background-eld

gauge produces a much simpler eective action.

in other words, the background-

eld gauge produces an eective action without ghosts: although we can drop ghost

terms from the eective action in general, because there are no physical external

ghost states (since we calculate only the tree graphs of the eective action), the

result is not normally brst invariant; but in the background-eld gauge it is still

brst invariant, since it is gauge invariant. this means that the background-eld

gauge yields not only simpler results, but fewer calculations: many terms can be

determined by gauge covariantization.

exercise vib8.3

consider an eective action for yang-mills plus matter in a background-eld

gauge. its gauge invariance can be used to derive ward-takahashi identi-

ties. (these were originally expressed as properties of the s-matrix, but are

much simpler to understand in terms of the eective action.)

a show that the part of the eective action quadratic in the yang-mills elds,

and independent of the matter elds, is invariant under the abelian gauge

transformations. (hint: taylor expand.) thus, in such gauges the quantum

correction to the gluon propagator is transverse.

b by the same method, nd a relation between any quantum 3-point vertex

coupling matter to yang-mills and the corresponding matter propagator cor-

rection. (note a simpler case: since the renormalization counterterms are

b. gauges

387

local, gauge invariance just says that the coecients of the two corresponding
counterterms are the same, i.e., they occur in the combination  /  .)

however, this does not mean we can completely ignore brst and ghosts by using
background-eld gauges: although the eective action is gauge invariant and ghost
free, ghosts and brst still appear in the (quantum-gauge-xed) classical action. in
practice this means, as far as calculating the feynman graphs that contribute to the
eective action, that in the background-eld gauge calculations are about one loop
simpler than in other gauges. for example, for one-loop graphs we eectively cal-
culate free one-loop vacuum bubbles (including ghosts) covariantly coupled to back-
ground elds: there are fewer of the complications of nonabelian theories, since the
quantum elds appear only as non-gauge elds with covariant couplings and no self-
interactions. however, already at two loops we have self-interactions of the quantum
elds, which include the same kinds of terms that would have appeared had we not
used a background-eld formalism.

another complication is that brst invariance is not as restrictive as gauge invari-
ance: it can be shown that in general gauges at the quantum level brst invariance
is preserved only up to wave-function renormalizations (rescalings) of the quan-
tum elds. however, in the background-eld gauge wave-function renormalizations
of the quantum elds can be ignored, since the quantum eld is a dummy vari-
able: there are no external quantum elds, so all such factors cancel. (actually, we
can also ignore wave function renormalization counterterms in non-background-eld
gauges, since when calculating s-matrix elements such divergences will be canceled
by corresponding divergences in the external-line factors.
in general, external-line
normalization factors may be nontrivial even when wave-function renormalization is
performed, depending on the renormalization scheme.)

an exception is abelian gauge theories, such as qed: because the gauge-invariant
action for just the gauge elds is free, background eld gauges are identical to ordinary
gauges. also, the ghosts decouple (for linear gauge conditions).

9. nielsen-kallosh

so far we have considered only gauges where the gauge-xing term is the square
of the gauge-xing function. more generally, well need gauge-xing terms of the form

vi. quantum gauge theory

however, b is no longer auxiliary, so we cant eliminate it by its eld equation. but
we can diagonalize the lagrangian by the corresponding redenition,

b  b + 1

of

(the jacobian of such redenitions is unity, the determinant of a triangular matrix

of the form(cid:0) 1

x

1(cid:1).) the gauge-xing terms are then
4 bo1b + 1

4 fof

the inverse operator is inconvenient for feynman rules. we know that integrating
out b gives a functional determinant, so o1 can be replaced by an o if we change
the statistics of the nakanishi-lautrup eld. however, this is a bit formal, since tech-
nically o must be symmetric between the two bs, while it should be antisymmetric
between two fermions.

a useful example is gauge xing for super yang-mills in superspace. gauge xing
for massless yang-mills is actually more dicult than for the massive (higgs) case,
considered in subsection vib5. well look at the abelian theory, to determine what
kind of gauge xing we need to dene the propagator. (with slight generalization,
this is also sucient for the background-eld gauge: see the following subsection.)
in that case the brst transformations are

qv = i( c  c),
where c, c, and b are chiral. using the result (the abelian case of exercise ivc4.1)

qc = qb = q c = q b = 0

q c = ib,

q c = i b,

w = i d2dv

the gauge-invariant kinetic term is (rearranging derivatives and using integration by
parts; see subsection vib5)

l0 = z d2 1

2w w = z d4 1

2v d d2dv =z d4 v ( 1

4  d2d2)v

to gauge-x to the fermi-feynman gauge we choose

=z d4 [( cc  c c)  (b + b)v  b( 1

)1 b]

(dropping d4 integrals of totally chiral or totally antichiral terms, which vanish). if
we were to simply redene b by

b  b  d2d2v,

b  b  d2 d2v

b. gauges

389

the gauge-xing terms would diagonalize as (using d2d2 d2 = 1

l = l0 + l1 z d4 [ 1

4v v + cc  c c  b( 1

because b is complex, the replacement of b with a fermionic supereld can
be performed classically, just like the rest of the gauge-xing procedure. we thus
introduce ghosts for a trivial gauge invariance as described in subsection via4:

qd = e,

q e = i d,

qe = q d = 0

we have treated the ghosts and their hermitian conjugates independently; alterna-
tively, we can consider d and e as not being the conjugates of d and e. the gauge
xing is simply

we next make the redenition

l2 = iq( ed) = dd  i ee

d  d + ( 1

d  d + ( 1

2

)1d2b

which has the eect

z d4 [ dd  b( 1

2

)1 b] z d4 dd +z d2 db +z d2  d b

which vanishes, after using the now-algebraic eld equations from varying b and
b. alternatively, we can make this eld redenition instead of the previous eld
redenition: we then have the terms

z d4 [ dd  (b + b)v ] +z d2 db +z d2  d b z d4 v d2d2v

after using the still-algebraic b equations.

the net result

l = l0 + l1 + l2 z d4 ( 1

4 v v + cc  c c  i ee)

is that the original nonlocal b term has been replaced classically with the local
ee term, which yields the same determinant upon quantization, but gives simple
feynman rules more directly. (the determinant is nontrivial in the background-eld
gauge. a similar procedure can be applied to gauge xing for spin 3/2.)

perform the analogous quantization for the nonabelian case of pure super
yang-mills (no matter), using the super gervais-neveu gauge. compare with
the limit m  0 of the model considered in subsection vib5, and show the
v part of the action agrees.

10. super background-eld

although in principle the background-eld formalism is the same for supersym-
metric theories as nonsupersymmetric, there are some technical dierences because of
the nonlinearity in the prepotentials. (similar remarks apply to nonlinear  models.)
the basic idea is that we want to expand the full covariant derivative in quantum
elds about background-covariant derivatives: as for the nonsupersymmetric case,
  d + ia, but now a is further expressed in terms of d and the prepotential
because of the constraints. the generalization in this case (and for nonlinear  mod-
els) is easy because the solution to the constraints makes the prepotentials appear
as (complex) group elements: because of the closure of group multiplication, we can
write

in terms of quantum (gq) and background (gb) group elements (elds). more explic-
itly, for our case we write (see subsection ivc4)

g  gbgq

and thus for the covariant derivatives

e  eb eq

  eqdeq

absorbing the background prepotential completely into the background covariant
derivative

d = eb deb

in other words, as the name suggests, the full covariant derivative  has been ex-
panded about an arbitrary background, described by b. (this is even clearer in the
supergravity case, where we simply replace the at-space d with the curved-space

b. gauges

391

d, since d is more than a partial derivative, and already contains the at-space
part of the metric tensor.) for purposes of quantization, it is most convenient to go
to a chiral representation for the quantum eld. for the background eld we need not
be so specic, since it is hidden in the background covariant derivatives. the result
is then

  ev dev ,
where v is the quantum eld.

exercise vib10.1

solve the rest of the commutator algebra to nd expressions for all the eld

the rest of the quantization procedure then follows as for the nonsupersymmetric

particular, for the terms in the gauge-xed classical action quadratic in the quantum

ghosts and matter are quantized straightforwardly: for matter we have

  ev (  + );

d . = d  = 0

the action thus looks the same as usual ((  + )ev ( + ), etc.), except that all chiral
superelds are now background-chiral. for the standard ghosts we have for the ghost

the full nonlinear transformation law from exercise ivc4.3)

action sc =r dx d4 lc (remembering there are no background ghosts, and using
lc = ( c + c)lv /2[coth(lv /2)(c  c) + (c + c)] = ( c + c)(c  c) + o(v )

 ( cc  c c) + o(v )

the same as in non-background gauges, except again the ghosts are background-chiral.
now the nielsen-kallosh ghost of the previous subsection is nontrivial: we again have

ln k = i ee

but these ghosts also are background-chiral. this means they contribute to the eec-
tive action only at one loop, through vacuum bubbles.

we have seen how covariant expansions of the s-matrix can be based on various
denitions of h. covariant expansions can also be based on spacetime quantum
numbers: for example, we can perturb in mass; this is equivalent to adding low-
energy corrections to the high-energy approximation. also, the rst-quantized version
of the h expansion, which expands in powers of momenta, is eectively an expansion
in inverse powers of mass (low-energy approximation).

the only other spacetime property of a particle is spin, or helicity for massless
particles in d=4. it is possible to dene expansions in terms of it by describing the
leading order by a complex action. this violates semiclassical unitarity at that order;
however, the loop expansion violates unitarity at tree order also, so the expansion
is still useful as long as unitarity returns once the expansion has been summed.
furthermore, we have already seen that gauges where unitarity is not manifest have
some advantages over unitary gauges. in particular, the gervais-neveu gauge uses a
complex gauge condition.

1. yang-mills

we rst consider calculations for massless theories; these are simpler than massive
ones in d=4 because the little group of the lorentz group is so(d2) instead of
so(d1), and is thus abelian: we can label the spin of a state by an integer or half-
integer, the helicity, by use of the spacecone formalism. to simplify notation, we drop
the transverse index (pt  p), and distinguish 4-momentum p from its transverse
component p by using upper- and lower-case. we also use color ordering; i.e., we
examine only planar diagrams for each permutation of external lines.

we begin by summarizing the spacecone rules for pure yang-mills found in sub-

derivatives as momentum operators for later convenience, is

the reference external line factors occur only in the above combinations, because only
1 term of 1 of the 3-point vertices contributes to each.

the simplest examples are classes of diagrams that vanish by virtue of their
maximal helicity violation: by simple counting of +s and s, we see that the tree
graphs with the fewest external s, those with only self-dual vertices (++), have a
single external . thus the all + amplitude vanishes automatically. furthermore, the
diagrams with a single external  must have that line chosen as one of the reference
lines. however, by the above rules that line can carry only the anti -self-dual vertex
(+), so those amplitudes also vanish.

the simplest nonvanishing amplitude is ++. we consider the case where the
helicities are cyclically ordered as ++; we label them 1234, and choose 1 and
4 as the reference lines; this amplitude can be denoted as +. (p4 = |+i[+|,
p1 = |i[|: the positive-helicity reference line gives the reference momentum for
negative helicity, and vice versa.) we label all external momenta as owing inward.
there are only three diagrams; however, the + reference line uses only the ++
vertex, while the  reference line uses only the + vertex, so the 4-point-vertex
diagram vanishes, as does the diagram with both reference lines at the same vertex.
thus, we are left with only 1 graph.

a more complicated example is the +++ amplitude. again taking color-

with lines labeled 12345, picking 1 and 5 as the reference lines, which we denote as
++. again dropping all graphs with a reference line at a 4-point vertex or 2
references lines at a 3-point, all 5 graphs with a 4-point vertex are killed, and only
3 of the remaining 5 survive. (we also need to consider various combinations of +
and  indices, but only 1 survives for each graph because of the chirality of 3-vertices
with reference lines.)

exercise vic1.3

using the spacecone gauge, evaluate all diagrams contributing to the six-point
gluon (yang-mills) scattering tree amplitude (t-matrix) with color-ordered
helicities ++++, that correspond to the symmetric diagram with a central
3-point vertex each of whose legs is connected to another 3-point vertex, each
of which carries 2 of the external lines.

these results can be generalized to arbitrary (color-ordered) n-point tree ampli-
tudes with two  helicities, labeled i and j, and the rest + (parke-taylor ampli-
tudes): the result is (in an obvious notation), including now the coupling (g)n2,

2. recursion

a simple way to derive higher-point amplitudes is using the classical eld equa-
tions. (see subsection vc3. in the literature, the eld has often been mistaken for
the current, since   /j, j  /. as usual, these are distinguished by the fact
the eld always has an external propagator, while the current has it amputated, since
k + ... = j.) the steps are:
(1) calculate the rst few terms in the series (enumerated by the number of external

lines).

(2) guess the general result.

(3) prove that it is correct by induction, using the classical eld equations.

of course, the second part is the hardest in general (at least when one simplies the
third step by using spacecone methods), and has been possible for just a couple of
cases, only because the results for those cases are so simple. since these results are for
o-shell elds, and not s-matrix elements, they are gauge dependent: for example,
if they are inserted into larger diagrams, the same choice of reference lines must be
used.

the solution to the classical eld equations is given by tree graphs with all external
lines but one (the eld itself) amputated and put on shell. (the usual external-line
wave functions describe the asymptotic eld, which is free.) the two cases with

c. scattering

399

known solutions are those where all the on-shell lines have the same helicity, or one
dierent. note that the eld a has a  associated with the opposite end of its
external propagator. we then see in the former case, with all +s on on-shell lines,
that a vanishes because there are no fully-amputated diagrams, even o-shell, with
only +s externally (again counting +s and s on vertices). similarly, for the latter
case, with only one  on an on-shell line, we see that a has only ++ vertices;
but setting that one on-shell  to be a reference line (which by denition must be
on-shell), it is not allowed such a vertex, so a vanishes also in this case. by similar
reasoning, we see that a+ in the former case consists entirely of ++ vertices; and
in the latter case consists of all ++ except for one + (no ++), which must
have the  reference line directly attached.

the appearance of only the self-dual eld (a+) and almost only the self-dual
vertex (++) means that in both cases one is essentially solving equations in the
self-dual theory: if we take just the kinetic term and ++ vertex from the action,
and make the eld redenitions (see exercise vib6.2)

a+ = p,

a = p1 

we obtain (after integration by parts and rearrangement inside the trace)

l+,++ = ( 1

2p 2 + [p, p])

these redenitions make the ++ vertex local.  appears only as a lagrange mul-
tiplier, and its variation gives the self-dual eld equation
.)( .) = 0

2  + i(

1

(which diers from the result of subsection iiic5 by an i from the use of p instead of
 in the eld redenition, and    from the use of the spacecone instead of the
lightcone).

we now consider in more detail the simpler (former) example (the one which
does not directly give a nontrivial scattering amplitude). as a slight simplication,
we look at the recursion relation for the eld  as dened in the self-dual theory. the
recursion relation is now (see subsection vc3), scaling the coupling out of the kinetic
term,

(1, n) = 

g

1
2p 2(1, n)

n1xi=1

(1, i)(i + 1, n)[p(1, i)p(i + 1, n)  p(1, i)p(i + 1, n)]

p (j, k) 

pm

kxm=j

400

vi. quantum gauge theory

where we again use color ordering, number the external lines cyclically, and (j, k)

denotes the eld with on-shell lines with momenta pj through pk. (thus, on the
left-hand side of the equation the eld has n on-shell lines, while on the right-hand
side the two elds have i and ni.) plugging in the twistor expressions for the vertex
momenta, we nd

p(1, i)p(i + 1, n)  p(1, i)p(i + 1, n) =

ixj=1

nxk=i+1

h+ji[jk]h+ki

if we are clever we can guess the general result from explicit evaluation of the

lower-order graphs; instead we nd in the literature, after the above redenition,

(i, j) = (g)n1

1

h+iihi, i + 1i  hj  1, jih+ji

where n is the number of background momenta (pi, ..., pj) for (i, j). for the initial-
condition case n = 1 this is simply the statement that the external line factor for 

is now

 =

=

h+pi2

the induction hypothesis is also easy to check: the product of the two s from the

induction hypothesis gives the desired result by itself up to a simple factor:

(1, i)(i + 1, n) =  1

g (1, n)

hi, i + 1i

h+iih+, i + 1i

(the algebra of the color indices works as usual.) we then perform the sum over i
before that over j and k (the complete sum is over all i, j, k with 1  j  i < k  n),
making use of the identity

multiplying this by the vertex momentum factor gives a sum over j < k of hjki[jk] =

3. fermions

we have seen in subsection vib7 how these methods can be applied to massless
spinors. rather than applying the rules directly, in this subsection we examine the
relation of the results in qcd to those in pure yang-mills theory. we also saw in
subsection vib7 how supersymmetry could be used to relate dierent qcd ampli-
tudes. however, in practice supersymmetry relations give only a few useful relations,
and only ones that can already be seen directly from the spacecone rules, which give
more results than can be seen by supersymmetry alone.

the simplest relations that follow from supersymmetry are the vanishing of tree
graphs with fewer than two negative helicities, which we saw in subsection vic1
follows automatically from the spacecone rules. the remaining useful supersymme-
try relation for tree graphs is the relation between parke-taylor amplitudes for pure
yang-mills and those with one external line each of positive and negative helicity
replaced with spinors or scalars. the easiest way to see this result is to make use
of the conventions of the selfdual theory, as in the preceeding subsection. in parke-
taylor amplitudes only one vertex is a non-selfdual vertex, which accounts for the
simplicity of these amplitudes.
(tree amplitudes with only selfdual vertices van-
ish.) furthermore, after transforming to the selfdual conventions, all (nonvanishing)
selfdual vertices are identical  independent of spin. furthermore, the nonselfdual
3-point vertex with one negative-helicity gluon chosen as a reference line (the only
non-selfdual vertex well need for this relation) is independent of the spins of the
remaining two lines. consequently, the only dierence between the two amplitudes
we are relating comes from the dierence in normalization of external line factors for
gluons and quarks (and scalars).

we will not review the superspace formulation of selfdual supersymmetric theories
here. the main features will be evident from the example of supersymmetric qcd
that we now examine in more detail. the main result follows from treating the selfdual
eld of the nonsupersymmetric theory as a spacecone (or lightcone) supereld, as in
subsection vib7. dimensional analysis then tells us that the eld of helicity h has
dimension 1  h. the appropriate redenitions of the spacecone elds are then

a+  pa+, +  p+,   ,   , a 

1

for the yang-mills elds a, spinors , and scalars . the resulting external line
factors are then simply

h+pi2h

402

after these redenitions, the kinetic terms, selfdual (++) vertices, and antiselfdual
vertices for  gluon reference line (referencing positive helicity) are

p2 a(cid:19) ([pa+, a] + {p+, })

for supersymmetric qcd. (in the a3 term in the last line we have used integration
by parts, and dropped a (p+/p)a term that vanishes for the reference line: there
(p+/p2) = 1 now, so (p+/p) = 0 vanishes for that line since p  0.)

exercise vic3.1

apply these redenitions to the full action for supersymmetric qcd given in
subsection vib7:

a find the action and external line factors (especially for reference lines).

b evaluate the 4-gluon tree amplitude for 2 positive and 2 negative helicities

with these modied rules.

we now see easily that the terms l2 and l3,sd that dene the selfdual theory are
independent of whether boson or fermion is chosen for the positive helicity elds and
the negative helicity one (only the helicities of the elds must add up to 0 for l2 and 1
for l3,sd for lorentz invariance). thus, supersymmetry is a much stronger restriction
in a selfdual theory than a nonselfdual one. finally, the current that couples to the
reference line (p+/p2)a is also the same for bosons and fermions. we therefore have,
for example, the relation

(, 1

2 , + 1

2, +   +) = h13i
h12i

(  +   +)

for the color-ordered tree amplitudes (where we have labeled helicities 1 by ).
this follows from choosing line 1 as reference line  (for positive helicity, from a line
with negative helicity). for example, from our result for the 4-gluon tree, we have
the 2-quark, 2-gluon tree

(, 1

2, +) = h12i2h13i

4. masses

the spacecone formalism yields the simplest method for deriving s-matrix ele-

ments in massless theories (at least for trees; for loops it may be preferable to use

background eld gauges, with a lorentz gauge, like gervais-neveu, for the quantum

gauge and spacecone for the background gauge). the analogous method for the mas-

sive case is to use actions based on self-dual elds, as described in subsection iiic4.

the advantage of these two methods is that they use elds that are representations of

the little group, so in the massive case elds have 2s+1 components and only undotted

spinor indices (so(3)=su(2)), while in the massless case they have only 2 components

and no indices (so(2)=u(1)). although the actions used are more complicated, this

is just a reection of the fact that algebra that is usually done repetitively in graphs

has been performed once and for all in the action.

however, in the massive case the simplication is not as drastic as in the massless

one: s-matrix elements are just simpler in massless theories, with many vanishing;

the spacecone method takes advantage of this simplication in the nal results by

simplifying the intermediate steps. the massive examples we will consider in this

subsection, taken from qed, are somewhat simple in any case, so we will stick to

the older methods (although the uses of methods based on self-duality are still being

explored).

the major dierence in simplicity between the massless and massive cases (in any

approach) is in the external line factors. the ambiguity in the explicit expressions

for the external line factors is just the little group: in the massless case the solutions

to the eld equations (one solution and its complex conjugate) are unique up to a

phase factor, which is why the twistor formalism is so useful. in the massive case the

solutions (2s+1) are ambiguous up to an su(2) transformation, which means they are

messy for any choice. just as in the massless case the twistor is part of the lorentz

transformation from an arbitrary frame to the lightcone frame, in the massive case

the solutions are part of the transformation to the rest frame. in other words, the

external line factors simply convert lorentz indices to little-group indices; this makes

indices trivial for the massless case (in d=4), and not as nice for the massive.

the result is that in practice whenever any of the external particles are massive

their external line factors are left as implicit in s-matrix elements, and only their

squares are explicitly evaluated, in cross sections. this was common in older experi-

ments (especially qed), since recent experiments are mostly at energies so high that

masses of external, stable particles are usually neglected. this adds to the algebra,

404

vi. quantum gauge theory

since it means that lorentz algebra is performed in each of n2 terms in the cross
section rather than n terms in the s-matrix.

furthermore, the algebra is usually simplied by considering experiments where
polarization is determined in neither the preparation of the initial states nor the
measurement of the nal states. this was also common in older experiments, when
devices for polarization were not well developed. the result is that one averages over
initial states and sums over nal states, producing the same algebraic factors that
appear in the propagator, as described in subsection vb3:  is replaced with +.
one then applies the rules for feynman diagrams for cross sections, as described in
subsection vc7.

the standard s-matrices in qed are the 4-point tree graphs, with 2 3-point
vertices and 1 internal propagator. there are just 2 graphs to consider, with various
labelings of momenta: (1) the graph with 4 external fermions (electrons/positrons)
connected by 1 internal photon describes both mller (electron-electron) and bhabha
(electron-positron) scattering, 2 labelings each. (2) the graph with 2 external photons
and 2 external fermions, as a continuous line that includes the 1 internal fermion,
describes compton (electron-photon) scattering as well as electron-positron creation/-
annihilation, also 2 labelings each. in each case, the 1 s-matrix diagram results in 2
cross section diagrams, each with 2 momentum labelings (for a total of 22=4): 1
diagram from multiplying similar terms and 1 from cross-terms.

in dirac spinor notation the lagrangian for qed is (see subsection iiia4)

8f 2 +  (i/  ea/ + m2

)

where we have scaled the e into the vertex. the feynman rules are now (fermi-

for dening the cut propagator; ghosts decouple in qed.)

2 p2. (we use the fermi-feynman-gauge propagator also

the cross section diagrams contain closed fermion loops, resulting in traces of
products of  matrices (with a 1 for each loop by fermi-dirac statistics). the
algebra is manageable for the present case, using the 4d -matrix identities from
subsection iia6:

aa = 2,

aa/a = a/,

aa/b/a = a  b,

aa/b/c/a = c/b/a/

405

tr(i) = 4,

tr(a/b/) = 2a  b,

tr(a/b/c/d/) = a  b c  d + a  d b  c  a  c b  d

the traces encountered in the above processes are of the form

n1 = tr(aabb)tr(acbd)

n2 = tr(aaabbcbd),

n3 = tr(aabbacbd)
, etc. using the above identities, these are evaluated as

where a = a/ + m2

n1 = 4m4 + 2m2(a  b + c  d) + 2(a  c b  d + a  d b  c)

n2 = 4m4 + m2[2(a + c)  (b + d)  a  c  4b  d] + (a  b c  d + a  d b  c  a  c b  d)

n3 = 2m4 + m2(a  b + a  c + a  d + b  c + b  d + c  d) + 2a  c b  d

5. supergraphs

in supersymmetric theories the easiest way to calculate feynman diagrams is in
superspace. supersymmetric cancelations are then automatic, and new special prop-
erties of supersymmetric theories are revealed. the derivation of the supergraph
rules is similar to that of subsection vc1, except for some ne points in the treat-
ment of chiral superelds. the path integral required the explicit evaluation of only
a gaussian for perturbation. since we dropped proportionality constants, this was
equivalent to substituting the solution to the classical, free eld equations back into a
quadratic action. for real scalar superelds (used for super yang-mills) this is trivial,
but chiral scalar superelds (used for scalar multplets) satisfy the chirality constraint,
and have superpotential terms:

integrals over chiral superspace (r dx d2), not the

full superspace (r dx d4).

before writing the feynman rules, we rst note that functional dierentiation

with respect to a chiral supereld, as follows from the above variation, gives



(x, )

(x, ) = d24(  )(x  x)

this means that there will be an extra d2 at the  end of any chiral propagator and
an extra d2 at the  end. we could associate these directly with the propagator, but

we will use one factor of d2 to convert ar d2 intor d4 at any superpotential vertex,

and similarly for the complex conjugate. therefore, we include such factors explicitly

as a separate feynman rule for the ends of chiral propagators. however, this means
the  propagator (and similarly for  ) gets an extra factor of d2/ 1
to compensate
2
for the fact that we include two d2 factors, whereas it really had only one because
its integral was only d2. furthermore, we fourier transform x as usual, but not ,
basically because there is no translation invariance in , but also for a better reason

to be explained soon. the feynman rules of subsection vc4 are then modied as:

we next explain how  integrations are performed on any connected graph. con-
sider any two vertices directly connected by a propagator. all the spinor derivatives
acting on its 4(  ) can be removed from that propagator by integration by parts.

we then can use that  function to trivially integrate over , removing ther d4 and

that 4(  ), and replacing  everywhere with . eectively, those two vertices
have been contracted to the same point in  space, eliminating that propagator as
far as  dependence is concerned. we can repeat this procedure until all vertices are
contracted to a single point. however, we are then left with a tadpole for each
loop: contracting propagators this way sequentially around a loop identies all the
vertices of that loop, and leaves the loop as a single propagator with both ends at
that point. to evaluate this tadpole, we note that

[ d2d24(  )]|= = 1

( derivatives can be converted into minus  derivatives when acting directly on
the ; this is basically integration by parts.) fewer derivatives give 0; more can be
reduced to terms of 4 or less. this completes all the evaluation in  space, leaving an
expression in terms of elds (some with ds acting on them) with dierent momenta,
times the usual momentum factors, with the usual momentum integrals, but all at

the same , with a singler d4. this means that the generating functionals w and
r d4, but none with r d2. however, to do it we had to introduce the factors
d2/( 1
2 p2) into the  propagators. on the other hand, such a factor can easily
be killed by a d2 from a vertex: we sandwich the d2 between a d2 from each vertex,

there is a further consequence of this evaluation. we have obtained terms with

using the identity d2d2 d2 =  1
we cant do that everywhere is if every vertex is a superpotential (so every propagator
in the graph is  and every external eld is ), since otherwise we can inductively

cause there are exactly enough ds left to make the tadpoles nonvanishing, leaving an

borrow d2s from some non-r d2 vertex. any such 1pi graph always vanishes, be-
r d4 of a product of s with no ds, which vanishes. on the other hand, for a tree
graph there is exactly one d2/p2 left, which converts ther d4 to anr d2.

the net result is that not only are w and  local in , but only their classical

in massive theories) are always canceled.

in particular, this implies that all uv

exercise vic5.1

calculate all the contributions to w [, ] from 4-point trees in massive super-
3 theory, and write the result in both p- and x-space (in analogy to the
nonsupersymmetric example at the end of subsection vc4).

improvements again result from using background-eld gauges. we have already
seen in subsection vib10 the modication to the quantization for supersymmetric
background-eld gauges. the background-eld expansion can be dened by solving
the constraints on the full covariant derivatives in terms of quantum prepotentials
but background potentials (aa, not v ), essentially by covariantizing da to the back-
ground a. then  can be manipulated (integration by parts, etc.) in the graphs
in the same way as d was, leaving only aa (not a) and its derivatives (w, etc.) as
background elds. this leads to improved power counting, and can be used to prove
superrenormalizability (niteness beyond one loop) for n=2 extended supersym-
metric theories, and niteness for n=4.

as for other gauges (background-)chiral superelds need special treatment, now
to get the most out of background gauge invariance. variation can be dened in the
obvious way, but now we also need the covariantized identity

d2d2 = 1

2( + i[w ,d])

from pushing the ds to the right and using the commutation relations. the func-
tional integral over the quantum background-chiral superelds can also be performed
in the same way as for other gauges, the only modications being background co-
), and the fact that
variantization (including the above nonminimal term for

background elds externally). specically, if we look at the general derivation of
the feynman rules in subsection vc1, we see it gave rules for all graphs except the
one-loop vacuum bubble, since this graph has no (quantum) vertices. these rules, as
adapted to superspace earlier in this subsection, are now modied only by the covari-
antization just discussed, which only adds background potentials (not prepotentials)
and eld strengths to propagators and vertices. the background-covariantized prop-
agators then can be further expanded about the free
. the net result is that in
all diagrams except (perhaps) these chiral one-loop vacuum bubbles the background
elds appear only in the form of potentials and eld strengths. these vacuum bubbles
then can be evaluated by the usual methods, since the formerly neglected gaussian
path integral for these quantum-free elds is just the usual one-loop path integral
for a chiral supereld with external yang-mills superelds, only the external elds are
now identied as background instead of quantum. in some cases, this last calculation
can be further simplied to again yield an expression directly in terms of potentials
without explicit prepotentials (see subsection viiia6 below).

when innities were rst found in perturbative quantum eld theory, they were
thought to be a serious problem. a prescription can be given to remove these in-
nities, called regularization. it was later shown that this regularization can be
dened in such a way as to preserve all the desirable physical properties of the theory,
called renormalization. unfortunately, it seems that the original innities, exiled
by renormalization from any nite order of perturbation theory, return to plague eld
theory when all orders of perturbation theory are summed. therefore, renormaliza-
tion should not be considered a cure to the disease of innities, but only a treatment
that allows divergent theories to be more useful.

1. dimensional renormalization

perturbative renormalization is dened to preserve the three properties that
dene relativistic quantum eld theory (poincare invariance, unitarity, causality).
the most general prescription is to start with a classical theory that is causal, poincare
invariant, and satises the semiclassical part of unitarity (as described in subsection
vc5). this gives the tree graphs of the theory. one then applies unitarity to dene
a perturbation expansion, determining the higher orders (loop diagrams) from the
lowest (trees). although the usual loop diagrams are divergent, there is enough
ambiguity in the unitarity condition to allow removal of the divergences.

the only practical way to implement this procedure is to slightly modify the di-
vergent graphs one obtains from the naive use of the feynman graph rules (obtained,
e.g., from path integral quantization of a classical action). the steps are: (1) reg-
ularize each divergent graph by modifying the momentum integrals, introducing a
parameter(s), the regulator(s), giving a nite result that reproduces the original
divergent integral in a certain limit. (2) renormalize each regularized graph by
subtracting out the divergent part of the regularized graph, keeping only the -
nite part. once the graph has been rendered nite, the regulator can be dropped.

one then has to check that the method of removing divergences, order-by-order
in the perturbation expansion, preserves the three properties of relativistic quantum

a. general

415

eld theory. the easiest way to do this is to use both a regularization scheme and a
subtraction scheme that preserve these properties manifestly. the standard way for
the subtraction scheme to do this is to change the coecients of terms in the classical
action by (real) constants that depend on both the regulator and h. since the classical
action already satises poincare invariance, causality, and the semiclassical part of
unitarity, this will automatically preserve all the desired properties. in this manner
of renormalization, there thus remains only two steps to prove that a theory can be
renormalized: (1) the existence of a regularization that manifestly preserves the three
properties, and (2) that the modication of the action by making the coecients
regulator- and h-dependent is sucient to cancel all divergences that might reappear
in the limit as the regulator is removed.

the latter step, discussed in subsection viia5 below, can be further divided into
substeps, proving: (a) the ultraviolet divergence in any graph corresponding to scal-
ing all internal (integration) momenta to innity (the supercial divergence) comes
from a term in that graph polynomial in external momenta, and can therefore be can-
celed by a local term from the action; and (b) recursively in the number l of loops,
if the renormalization procedure has already been successfully applied through l1
loops, the resulting modication of the action is sucient to cancel all divergences
appearing at l loops except the supercial ones. the former substep is the one that
detemines whether the theory can be renormalized.

the former step is satised by dimensional regularization, the standard method of
regularization in relativistic quantum eld theory (and for practical purposes beyond
one loop, the only one). it is dened by writing the theory under consideration in
arbitrary dimensions d, and treating integrals over loop momenta as analytic func-
tions of d. these integrals are then analytically continued from lower d, where they
are (ultraviolet) convergent. the resulting expressions have pole singularities in d at
integer d, so these poles can be subtracted out as the divergent parts.

there are two main reasons why dimensional regularization is so useful: (1) most
classical actions can be written as easily in arbitrary dimensions as in d=4. (the
important exception is those that in some way involve the levi-civita tensor ab...c.
the diculty with such theories is not a drawback of dimensional regularization, but
a general property of quantum eld theory, and is related to the quantum breakdown
of classical symmetries, to be discussed later.) in particular, this means it manifestly
preserves gauge invariance (which is a part of unitarity), the property of relativistic
quantum eld theory most dicult to preserve. it is also the only workable scheme
of regularization to do so.

416

vii. loops

(2) it requires only one regulator, the number of dimensions d itself. (most other

regularization schemes require at least one regulator for each loop.) this is the main

reason why this scheme is the only practical method of regularization at higher loops.

(an enormous number of regularization schemes have been proposed, almost all of

which work well at one loop, but all of them are more dicult than dimensional

regularization already at two loops, and even worse at three loops and higher.)

the renormalization scheme based on this regularization is also very simple:
dening d = d02 (where d0 is the physical dimension, usually 4), we can laurent
expand any l-loop amplitude in , starting at 1/l. these 1/n terms arise from n
or more divergent d-momentum integrals. if we cancel all the negative powers of ,
we can take the limit d  d0 (  0) by just dropping all the positive powers of ,
i.e., evaluating the remainder at  = 0. the procedure is to modify the coecients

of the terms in the classical action (couplings, masses, and eld normalizations) by
making them - and h-dependent, giving them hl1/n (counter)terms. such terms
can cancel any local divergence at l loops. one then has to show that they also can-

cel all nonlocal divergences at higher loops resulting from this divergence appearing

in an l-loop subgraph. thus, the procedure is recursive: (1) apply the counterterms

obtained from calculations at less than l loops to cancel subdivergences; (2) cancel
the remaining, local, supercial divergences by introducing new l-loop counterterms.

the form of the supercial divergence can be determined by evaluating the divergence

coming from the region of momentum space where all loop momenta go to innity

at the same rate. the supercial divergence is determined by 1/ terms of this loop

and of subloop divergences; however, if the 1/ piece of a prospective counterterm

vanishes at a certain loop order, so do all higher powers at that loop order. thus, sim-

ple power counting (as well as global and local symmetries) is sucient to determine

what counterterms can appear at any particular loop order.

these rules are sucient for evaluating momentum integrals to the point where

renormalization can be applied. however, further simplications are possible where

spin is involved: techniques specic to d=4 are useful to simplify algebra in general,
and required to preserve manifest supersymmetry in particular. these methods treat

spin indices as 4d, in contrast to the vector indices on momenta (and coordinates),

which are analytically continued away from d=4 by the denition of dimensional

regularization. this is natural in 4d n=1 supersymmetric theories formulated in
superspace (or 4d n>1 in n=1 superspace), since there spins  1 are described by
scalar prepotentials: there the simple prescription is to continue in the dimension

of the commuting coordinates (x), while xing the dimension of the anticommuting

a. general

417

coordinates (). these rules, for either supersymmetric or nonsupersymmetric the-
ories, have a simple physical interpretation for integer d<4: dimensional reduction.
the reduced theories dier from those produced by simple dimensional regularization:
vectors get (4d) extra scalars; spinors may become multiple spinors. for super-
symmetric theories this is again natural, since vector and scalar multiplets remain
irreducible after dimensional reduction. unfortunately, vectors in nonsupersymmet-
ric theories reduce to vectors plus scalars that are not related by any symmetry, so
their renormalization is independent. however, the complications produced by the
extra renormalizations are usually smaller than the algebraic simplications resulting
from the restriction to 4d spin algebra, especially for lower loops. another compli-
cation is that levi-civita () tensors cant be treated consistently in the dimensional
reduction scheme. although serious in principle, in practice this is not a problem as
long as axial anomalies cancel, which is required anyway for unitarity. (see subsection
viiib3. also, axial anomalies are easier to calculate using pauli-villars regularization
than with any form of dimensional regularization.)

exercise viia1.1

consider the identity

a

which holds in d < 5, where  is a d-dimensional kronecker , as appears
from momentum integrals (since momenta themselves are d-dimensional by
denition), and p, q, r, s are momenta. show by index contraction that an
inconsistency arises when trying to analytic continue away from d = 4. this
diculty in dening totally antisymmetrized d-dimensional objects is why
levi-civita tensors dont exist in dimensional regularization.

where a, b, c are rst-order in  ; b is rst-order in p while c is second-order in p, m;
and l is the number of loops and p the number of propagators. also, we have used

418

vii. loops

matrix notation with respect to the l-dimensional loop-space, with respect to which a
is a matrix, b is a vector, and c is a scalar. finally, n represents all numerator fac-
tors (propagator numerators and vertices; everything but propagator denominators)
and has been brought outside the integral by fourier transformation (i.e., introducing
x to produce a generating functional for all numerators). the momentum integrals
are now gaussian, and can be evaluated by the methods of subsection ib3 (and va2):

a = n(p,ix)z dp  (det a)d/2e(bix)t a1(bix)/2c(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)x=0

some of the  integrations can be performed by various scalings of subsets of the
 s. for example, to see the supercial divergence of the graph we scale all of the  s
and insert the identity as

1 =z 

0

d   xi

i! ,

i = i

where  are feynman parameters. the amplitude then becomes

a = n(p,ix)z d p1ld/2 dp  (cid:16)1 x (cid:17) [det a()]d/2

e[b()t a()1b()/2c()]ib()t a()1xxt a()1x/2|x=0

(this method of introducing feynman parameters is equivalent to directly changing
variables from  s to  and one less , and nding the jacobian.)

the x derivatives in n must now be taken. for a contribution from these deriva-

tives of order n, we have  integrals of the form

where we have used the denition of the  function

and so on:

thus,  (z) has simple poles in z at all the nonpositive integers.

there is no momentum). show the result is  (a + b)b(a, b), where b is given
by the integral denition, thus proving the beta function can be expressed in
terms of gamma functions.

b use the integral denition of b to prove

b(x, x) = 212xb( 1

d  a1(1 +  )ab = b(a, b)

from the substitution  = z/(1  z). use this to show

 (z) (1  z) =  csc(z)

by changing variables  = eu, and closing the contour in the complex plane
to pick up the contributions from the poles. we thus have

 (z + n) (1  z  n) = (1)n (z) (1  z)

(which is also seen inductively from  (z + 1) =  (z)).

in general uv divergences will come from powers of 1/ in a  resulting from

the explicit factor of 1/2 cancels the factor of 2 obtained when varying the action with

lently, it gives the natural normalization for gaussian functional integration over

the 1/2, since then  and  can be varied (or integrated over) independently.

22 because the kinetic operator contains 1

the renormalization mass scale  has been introduced to preserve the mass
dimension of g in arbitrary spacetime dimension; it appears naturally with the nor-
malization 1
2m2. generally there
will be more than one coupling, but only one . for some purposes it may be con-
venient to scale the elds so that the coupling and  dependence appear only in the
interaction terms. we will usually suppress the  dependence, since it is determined
by dimensional analysis, and is relevant only for quantum corrections, where d 6= 4
becomes important.

2p2 and 1

note that our normalization diers from that normally chosen in the literature. it
has been chosen to give the normalization appropriate for gaussian integrals, which
appear in both the rst- and second-quantized theories. the rst dierence is the
factor of (2)d/2 for coordinate and momentum integration (rather than the usual 1
for coordinate and (2)d for momentum); the second is the factor of 1/2 multiplying
the kinetic operator p2 + m2 (contained in k), rather than 1. our normalization is
more natural not only for gaussian integration and fourier transformation, but also
slightly simplies perturbative eld theory calculations, allowing one to ignore spuri-
ous factors of 2 and especially 2. the net eect is only to change the normalization
of coupling constants, since such factors can be absorbed into the 1/g2 sitting in front.

for example, the most accurately experimentally veried prediction of quantum
theory is the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron, to be discussed later. the
result for the total magnetic moment, in various normalizations, to second order in
perturbation theory, is

where e is for our normalization (obviously the simplest), em is the normalization
you rst learned in classical mechanics (the one that gives e2
m/r2 as the electrostratic
force between two electrons), and ef t is the one you would see in other quantum
electrodynamics courses. to complicate matters, you may have also seen the denition
 = e2
f t/4, of which the only merit is supposed to be that 1/ is very close to
the integer 137, which is silly since 1/e2 is even closer to the integer 861. (actually,
 is the natural expansion parameter for nonrelativistic quantum mechanics, which
is basically 3d, but our e2 is more natural for the loop expansion, which is inherently
4d.) we have also used units h = 1; restoring it introduces the further complication
 = e2
f thf t/4 because of the dierence in the semiclassical expansions for
quantum mechanics and quantum eld theory.

m/hm = e2

furthermore, for nonabelian groups we have an extra factor of 1

2 compared to the
standard normalization because we normalize trd(gigj) = ij instead of trd(gigj) =
2ij: the latter originated from the case of su(2), where it cancels the 2 in the
1

diagonal generator (and in the others, if one uses hermitian ones rather than raising
and lowering). unfortunately, for su(n) with n  3 this historical normalization
introduces a 2, while not canceling factors like n (and making trd(gigj) n-
dependent would wreak havoc when considering subgroups, as well as for raising and
lowering operators). thus, in the above notation,

nonabelian :

although we have chosen a normalization for the coupling constants that is nat-
ural for gaussian momentum integration, and for symmetry with respect to fourier
transformation, in divergent integrals it has the disadvantage of having s (euler-
mascheroni constant) in the nite parts. another natural normalization that gets
rid of this irrational number from all graphs is to divide out the angular part of the
integrals: the volume of the unit d1-dimensional sphere (the surface of unit radius
in d-dimensional euclidean space), is easily evaluated with gaussians:

1 =z

we might therefore choose our normalization to cancel this factor in momentum
integrals, along with the (2)d from fourier transformation. then the action, e.g.,
for a massless scalar, might be normalized as (with conventional kinetic term)

this diers from our previous normalization by a factor of 1/ ( d
2 ), which is 1 in
exactly d=4, but diers innitesimally far away. the result is that the two schemes
will dier eectively by nite renormalizations: for example, in divergent one-loops
graphs the 1/ divergences will have the same coecient in the two schemes, but
the nite remainders will dier by constants, since eectively the coupling has been
redened by a factor of 1+o(). thus, the same result can be achieved by modiying
the counterterm to be proportional to 1/ + constant. hence, the earlier version of
dimensional regularization is called minimal subtraction (ms), while the modi-
cation inspired by the volume of the sphere is called modied minimal subtraction
(ms).

we now examine explicitly the dierence between the two schemes. as we can
see from our previous example, momentum integrals from scaling various subsets of
schwinger parameters in a multiloop diagram will produce  function factors of the
form, with this new normalization,

yi

[ ( d

2 )]li (ni  li

d
2 )

for some integers ni, where pi li = l.

in even dimensions d0 (especially 4), we
can use  (z + 1) = z (z) to write each li-loop factor as a rational function of
 = (d0  d)/2 times

[ (1  )]li (1 + li)  (e)lieli = 1

where we have written only the  dependence. thus all s cancel. this modica-
tion allows some further simplication by eliminating extra terms arising at 2 loops
involving (2) (but this is only 2/6; see exercise viia2.3). similar results can be
obtained by using  (1  ) instead of  ( d
2 ).

another subtraction scheme, the g scheme, is dened by normalizing momen-
tum integration so that the coecient of the 1-loop massless propagator correction
in 3 theory in 4 dimensions (see subsection viib4 below) is exactly 1/ (without
extra nite terms) times a power of 1
2p2, or that up to a sign in higher even dimen-
sions. (the normalization factor must be positive, and also nite and nonvanishing
as   0.) as for ms, we can also pull out rational factors to get just the  (1 + n)s.
the net eect of these two schemes, as compared to ms, is to modify h, which appears

for g.)

exercise viia3.1

explictly evaluate the dierence between the ms, ms, and g schemes to order

this particular x for eliminating irrational numbers works only for those arising
at one or two loops: in general, because subdivergences produce expressions of the
form  (1 + )/l at l loops, we encounter nite terms involving (l) at l loops,
which is irrational (worse than just s, es, 2s, etc.) for odd l. so, for example,
(3) appears at 3 loops, and it can be shown that (3) (and higher (n)) cant always
be canceled.

the momentum subtraction scheme (mom), rather than simplifying numer-
ically, is designed to give a more physical interpretation of the coupling constants
appearing in the action: it is dened so that they take their on-shell values. thus,
it is particularly suited to low-energy calculations, which involve an expansion about
the mass shell. for example, consider the quantum kinetic operator k + k, ap-
pearing in the quadratic part of the eective action. it depends on the momentum
through one variable: p2 or p/, etc. we then can consider taylor expanding it in this
variable about its classical on-shell value. (for reasons to be explained later, this
can be dangerous for massless elds, when it requires infrared regularization.) this
is equivalent to expanding in powers of the classical kinetic operator k itself. the
mom prescription is then to use subtraction terms k to cancel the terms in the
quantum correction k to the kinetic operator that are linear in k:

k = a + bk + o(k 2)  k = a  bk
=

 kren  k + k + k = k + o(k 2) 

1

+ o(k 0)

the two renormalizations are related directly to the wave function and mass renor-
malizations, one being proportional to the entire kinetic term, the other to the con-
stant (mass) term. the result is that the renormalized propagator has the same pole
and residue as the classical one.

note that the mom scheme, unlike the others, does not introduce an independent
mass scale : only physical masses set the scale. this is a consequence of the fact
that the mom scheme is designed for studying low-energy (near-mass-shell) behavior,
while the others are more suited for studying high-energy behavior. this will be
important for our explicit calculations later, when we see that mom is more useful for

a. general

425

qed, which is better dened (and thus more useful), in terms of perturbation theory,
at low energies, while qcd is better dened at high energies. more precisely, the on-
shell values of qed masses and couplings are observed experimentally, whereas those
of qcd are almost meaningless, since the corresponding particles are not observed
as asymptotic states. on the other hand, in qcd the introduction of the arbitrary
scale  allows the denition of a more physical mass scale, and its arbitrariness can
actually improve the accuracy of perturbative calculations.

4. optical theorem

writing the s-matrix as s = 1 + it , unitarity can be written as
1 = ss = (1  it )(1 + it ) = 1 + i(t  t ) + t t  t t = i(t   t )

(actually, the more useful statement is in terms of s = eit , since then t represents
the connected graphs, but the result of the argument is the same.) summation of a
probability over nal states then yields the optical theorem:

xf

|tf i|2 =xf

hi|t |fihf|t |ii = hi|t t |ii = 2 im tii

applying unitarity in terms of the cutting rules (subsection vc6), we see that this
condition can be applied to tii diagram by diagram, using any combination of parts
of tf i and t f i that t together to form the graph considered for tii. (for example,
the probability coming from a tree graph with two nal states is the imaginary part
of a one-loop graph with two intermediate states.) separating out the momentum-
conservation -function for a connected s-matrix element, we have nally

t = (cid:16)x p(cid:17) t  xf

(cid:16)x p(cid:17)|tf i|2 = 2 im tii

the simplest example of an experimental measurement of an interaction is a
decay rate. (the only particle properties contained in the free lagrangian are mass
and spin.) at the tree (classical) level, this is given directly by a cubic (for decay
into two particles) or higher-order term in the lagrangian. more generally, by the
optical theorem the decay probability is given by the imaginary part of the propagator
correction, evaluated on shell.

we then nd the total decay probability per unit time by dividing the probabil-
ity by the spatial density  times the spatial volume times the time duration, and
summing over nal states:

using the expressions for , and p in terms of |tf i|2, given in subsection vc7. the

the decay rate for a particle is frame dependent, but we usually pick the rest

decay probability per unit proper time:

(where s and t should not be confused with the mandelstam variables). for the

in the gauge v = 1, or as the classical value of the schwinger parameter from the
landau equations:

pa =

compare this result for dp/ds with that of exercise vc7.1a to obtain an
explicit expression of im tii in terms of |tf i|2 for the decay of a particle of
mass m into two particles of masses m1, m2. what happens to im tii for
m = m1 + m2, and for m < m1 + m2?

now the decay rate of a particle can also be associated with the imaginary part

of the mass, since

m = m  ir  ||2  |eim t|2 = e2rt

so the wave function for the particle at rest automatically includes a decay factor.
the probability of decay, normalized by dividing by ||2, is thus

this expansion is in terms of the free propagator 1/(em) and the connected graphs

we now check that this result agrees with that obtained from the eective action.

the quantum propagator has a pole at p2 = m 2 for some complex constant m:

we have normalized the propagator at the pole by rescaling the eld; we also keep
the real part of the mass the same as the classical value through renormalization of
the mass term. (only the real part can be renormalized consistently with unitarity.)
the on-shell condition is then at physical (real) momentum p2 = m2, so the kinetic
operator on-shell is

5. power counting

we now consider why subtracting out divergences, as poles in d, can be imple-
mented by giving singular d-dependence to the coupling constants. this is based on
dimensional analysis, which tells us how divergent a graph is at large momenta: the
ultraviolet (uv) divergence. (there are also infrared divergences, which occur for
physical reasons, and do not require renormalization. they occur only for massless
particles, and will be considered later.) consider rst any 1-loop 1pi graph. in mo-

mentum space, it has an integral over the loop momentum, r ddp. it will diverge

if the integrand (before introducing schwinger parameters) goes as pd or slower to
innite momentum (uv limit). in this limit we can ignore masses. if we dierentiate
this graph with respect to any of the external momenta, it will become more conver-
gent, since the power of momenta in the integrand decreases. (the numerator of the
integrand is a polynomial, while each factor in the denominator depends on the loop
momentum.) with enough derivatives, it becomes convergent. this means that the
divergent part of the graph is a polynomial in the external momenta. similar remarks
apply to any 1pi graph, if we consider the divergence coming from letting all loop mo-
menta go to innity, known as the supercial divergence. of course, the supercial
divergence is also polynomial in the coupling constants, as is the graph as a whole;
but the supercial divergence is also polynomial in the masses, since dierentiation
with respect to them has the same eect as with respect to external momenta.

we can determine several more properties of this local, but divergent, contribution
to the eective action. first of all, it is poincare invariant and invariant under all

428

vii. loops

global symmetries of the classical action, since the eective action is invariant for all
values of d, so poles in d are also. (consider, e.g., contour integration in d to pick
out the pole.) if we use the background eld gauge (or consider only abelian gauge
elds), then it is also gauge invariant. (however, possible exceptions are conformal
invariance and invariances involving 1, since those are not invariances of the classical
action for all d.) the other property we need is that the coecient of the divergence
is real. this follows from the fact that the s-matrix satises unitarity, as preserved
manifestly by dimensional regularization. as discussed in the previous subsection, we
have unitarity

ss = i, s = i + it  i(t   t ) = t t

as we saw in subsection vc6, this identity actually can be applied to a single graph,
where the element of t on the left-hand side of the equation is that graph, while on
the right-hand side the summation over intermediate states gives a sum where each
term divides the graph into two parts, one for t and one for t . we then see that
at any loop the imaginary part of a 1pi graph in t is given by sewing together
diagrams from lower loops. this means that any new divergence at any number of
loops must be real, since sewing doesnt introduce new (uv) divergences: sewed lines
are on shell, and phase space for on-shell states is always nite. (the 3-momentum
of each state is bounded by the energy, and each positive energy of an outgoing state
is bounded by the total energy of the system.)

since poincare and gauge invariances, locality, and semiclassical unitarity were
used as properties to determine the classical action, this suggests that the divergent
terms in the eective action might all be of the form of terms already in the classical
action. such a property is called (perturbative) renormalizability. when it holds,
all innities can be absorbed by a redenition of the coupling constants (and masses)
appearing in the classical action. this is physically important because all innities
are dened only up to nite pieces: for example, in dimensional regularization, we
saw in subsection viia3 that the d-dependent normalization of the classical action
is ambiguous, resulting in an ambiguity in the nite pieces left over after subtrac-
tion of 1/ terms. since we now know that supercial divergences are local, we see
that renormalization can produce arbitrary nite, local terms in the eective action,
corresponding to the divergent terms. but if the divergent terms are all of the same
form as in the classical action, all such nite terms can be absorbed by a redention
of the coupling constants. on the other hand, if such nite terms did not already
appear in the classical action, we would be forced to introduce them, to make the
renormalization procedure unambiguous. (of course, we could give an unambiguous

a. general

429

prescription by denition, but from the point of view of another prescription this

would be the same as including the extra terms in the classical action, and using the
rst prescription to arbitrarily x the nonzero values of the couplings.) thus, the

condition of renormalizability is necessary to prevent the appearance of an innite
number of coupling constants, which would result in the loss of predictability. (if

divergences require only a nite number of such couplings to be added, we simply
include those, to obtain a renormalizable theory with a number of couplings that is

nite, although larger than that with which we started.)

since dimensional analysis determines the form of the divergent terms of any mo-

mentum integral, it also detemines which theories are renormalizable. by appropriate
rescaling of elds by constants, write the classical action in a form where the deriva-

tive parts of the kinetic terms have no dependence on any couplings. then dene the

couplings to be the coecients of the interaction terms. it is easy to see that the renor-
malizable theories are the ones that include all terms which satisfy all the properties

required of the classical action (including preservation of all appropriate symmetries
that are manifestly preserved by dimensional regularization), where all couplings have

engineering dimensions that are nonnegative powers of mass: consider rst the case
where all couplings are dimensionless (and there are no masses, or at least we ignore

them at high energies for purposes of considering uv divergences). then the theory
is renormalizable simply because there are no dimensionful parameters around, so

any local term must be of the form of those originally in the classical action. if we

now introduce couplings with positive mass dimension, then perturbatively they can
occur only to nonnegative power in any diagram, so any divergence thus produced

again has a coecient with nonnegative mass dimension. since the elds themselves
have positive mass dimension, there are only a nite number of such terms possible.

on the other hand, if we were to allow couplings with negative dimension, then terms
with arbitrarily high powers of such couplings would also allow arbitrarily high pow-

ers of elds, and thus lead to nonrenormalizability. (by similar arguments, theories
with only couplings of positive mass dimension, called superrenormalizable, can

have divergences only to a certain nite number of loops.)

in particular, in d=4 the derivative part of the kinetic term for bosons is of the

formr d4x , and for fermionsr d4x , so bosonic elds have dimension 1 and

fermions 3/2. that means that bosons can appear only quartically and fermions only
quadratically. more specically, renormalizable theories can only have terms of the

form

, 2, 3, 4, , 2, ; 2, ; 2

430

vii. loops

(where each  can be any boson with any spin, and each  any fermion). there can
also be constant terms (eld-independent), which we always drop, since they dont
contribute to perturbative amplitudes (after appropriate normalization). the terms,
and their relations, are restricted by lorentz, gauge, and internal symmetries. the
potential for scalar elds must also be bounded from below, to allow the existence of
a vacuum (state with lowest energy); otherwise nothing would be stable, continually
decaying into states of lower energy (i.e, the energy of the scalars converting to other
particles): thus, 3 terms for scalars requires also 4 terms.

spin 1 cant couple minimally to spins >1. (one way to show this is to covari-
bb + ka, and show the commutator
antize the general eld equation of iib1 to sa
algebra of this constraint, and + ..., doesnt close unless the spin 1 or the ex-
ternal eld strength vanishes.) furthermore, gauge invariance for spins >1 prevents
them from having renormalizable gauge couplings in d=4: for example, we saw in
subsection iiia4 that spin-2 (gravity) couplings include terms of the form .
renormalizability therefore restricts us to spins 0, 1/2, and 1. using poincare and
gauge invariance, the most general action is then of the form

l = trn 1

8g2 f 2 + i

.  . + 1

4()2 + v () + [ 1

2( + m2

) + h.c.]o

where all group matrices are implicit: they may appear in all elds, in m, and even
in g, which has independent values for the dierent factors of the yang-mills gauge
group. also, the matrices may dier for the same eld in dierent terms: a (in )
has dierent yang-mills representations on dierent scalar and spinor elds, and 
appears with some matrix in its yukawa coupling . (of course, all matrices must
be chosen consistently with gauge and global invariances.) the potential v () is no
higher than quartic. note that the higgs mechanism is required to give nonabelian
gauge elds mass: a2 is not gauge invariant, and ()2 is the only way to dress it up
with scalars in a renormalizable way. (for the abelian case we can use stuckelberg
elds, with  =  + mat as in subsection iva5. in the nonabelian case, introducing
scalars by a gauge transformation, as for stuckelberg, results in a nonrenormalizable
(eiei)2 term.) if we ignore gauge invariance, the a2 term produces unitary-gauge
propagators with bad high-energy behavior (see subsection vib3), which leads to the
same nonrenormalizable behavior in the absence of a higgs mechanism.

b lets do power counting (dimensional analysis) for 4d 3 theory. write the

so g2 counts loops. (  g gives the form where g counts vertices.) what
are the dimensionless terms

s = (g2)l1z dx n

for all n (including the vacuum bubbles n = 0; of course, l  0)? since super-
cial divergences are polynomial in everything (elds, momenta, couplings,

masses), this gives the maximum number of loops l(n) for a supercial di-

vergence to appear in an n-point 1pi amplitude. make a similar analysis for
3d 4 theory.

c find all the divergent 1pi diagrams in 4d 3 theory. (hint: there are 5, or

6 if we include the trivial 1-loop graph with no vertices.)

such global and local symmetry requirements can also be applied to the eective

action. in background-eld gauges  is gauge invariant (see subsection vib8), which

restricts the form of the eective potential, and even nonlocal terms. in qed charge

conjugation, in addition to switching 2-spinors of opposite charge, changes the sign

of the electromagnetic potential: consequently, any pure-a term in  must be even

in as (furrys theorem). such classical symmetries can be applied at the quantum

level only in the absence of anomalies, quantum violations (discussed in chapter

viii below). however, even the anomalies themselves are restricted by symmetries:

anomalies occur only in symmetries that cant be manifestly preserved by regular-

ization, which means only conformal or axial symmetries. thus, when the couplings

of gauge vectors are parity invariant, the axial anomaly (which violates parity by

denition) is irrelevant.

6. infrared divergences

although ultraviolet (uv) divergences represent a serious problem, in the sense
that they strongly restrict which theories can be useful, and require renormalization,
infrared (ir) divergences are merely a consequence of poor semantics: the denition
of the s-matrix assumes the existence of well-dened one-particle asymptotic states.
unfortunately, these do not exist when massless particles are present, even in classical
mechanics: (1) any particle can be accompanied by an arbitrary number of massless
particles with vanishing 4-momentum, and such a collection of particles can be indis-
tinguishable from the lone particle if the (measured) quantum numbers are the same.
(these are physical states, since pa = 0  p2 = 0.) (2) any massless particle can
be indistinguishable from an arbitrary number of massless particles, with the same
total 4-momentum, and each with the same sign energy, if their 4-momenta are all
proportional, since then they are all traveling in the same direction at the same speed.
(this situation is not important for qed, since the photon cant decay directly into
two photons.)

experimentally, because detectors have nite accuracy, in the rst case there
can be such soft particles with total energy below some small upper limit, and in
the second case there can be such colinear particles within some small angle of
resolution.
in principle this means we should change our denition of asymptotic
states accordingly; in practice this is too complicated, but to any particular order
in perturbation theory only a nite number of such additional massless particles will
couple. the procedure is then to

(1) infrared regularize the s-matrix amplitudes (by dimensional regularization, or

introducing masses for all particles, or keeping massless particles o-shell);

(2) calculate probabilities/cross sections, including contributions from soft and colin-
ear particles, as a function of some upper limit on their energy/angle (representing
the experimental accuracy); and

(3) remove the regularization.

no infrared renormalization is necessary. (examples will be given in later sections.
of course, for total cross sections, all energies and angles are integrated over any-
way.) in general, such a procedure must be applied to both initial and nal states
(thekinoshita-lee-nauenberg theorem), but in qed (as opposed to qcd) it is
sucient to treat only the nal ones in cases of physical interest.

the reason why innities appear in cross sections if we ignore this careful pre-
scription, and in s-matrix elements in any case, is the long range of forces mediated

a. general

433

by massless particles. a cross section, although it represents a probability, is nor-
malized in such a way that it is an area, representing the eective cross-sectional
area of a particle being targeted by another particle. the range of the interaction
sets the scale of this area; this is related to the mass of the particle mediating the
interaction. since massless particles produce innite-range forces, the result is in-
nite cross sections. one might expect that these innities would appear only in total
cross sections, where the momenta of particles in the nal state are integrated over.
however, by the optical theorem, this total cross section is given by the imaginary
part of an s-matrix amplitude, which thus must also have this innity.

the fact that these infrared divergences are physical also follows from the fact
that these kinematic situations occur in classical mechanics: in subsection vc8 we
saw that physical singularities occur in s-matrices for momenta that are allowed
classically.

exercise viia6.1

evaluate the total cross section for 22 scalar scattering at the tree level (as
in the example of subsection vc4), with all particles massless, and show it
has an infrared divergence. relate this divergence to a classical situation.

we now give some explicit examples of the evaluation of s-matrices and contri-
butions to the eective action  momentum integration, regularization, and renor-
malization  and some examples of their application.

1. tadpoles

. . .

the simplest examples of dimensional regularization are one-loop tadpoles,
graphs with only one external line. by the schwinger parameter method described
in subsection viia2, we nd

a1(x, m2) =z dk eikx

1

1
2(k2 + m2)

=z 

0

d d/2e( m2+x2/ )/2

further evaluation requires taylor expansion in x (which well need anyway to eval-
uate a specic integral of k...k/(k2 + m2)):

a1 =

xn=0

1

n!( 1

2 x2)n  (1  d

2  n)
( 1
2m2)1d/2n

the mass dependence, as well as the argument of the  function, are as expected by

dimensional analysis: r ddk k2n/k2 is ultraviolet divergent (large k) for d  2(1n),

and infrared divergent (small k) in the limit m 0 for d  2(1 n). the ultraviolet
divergence is reected in  (z), which has poles at the nonpositive integers.

to analyze the massless case, we evaluate the  integral for d < 2(1  n) and
m > 0, where it is nite and well-dened, analytically continue to the region re d >
2(1n) (but not exactly at the points where d is an even integer), take the limit m 
0 there, and nally analytically continue this vanishing result to all d. therefore, all
massless tadpoles can be taken to vanish in dimensional regularization:

or more generally

this includes negative a, particularly integrals of polynomials of momenta. such
an integral can result from measure factors, as discussed in subsections va2 and
vc1: for example, if an auxiliary eld appears in the action with its quadratic term
multiplied by a function of other elds, then functionally integrating it out of the
action results in a functional determinant (in addition to replacing it in the classical
action by the solution to its eld equation). this is represented in terms of feynman
graphs as one-loop diagrams whose propagators are all those of the auxiliary eld,
namely 1. the result is then regularized as

z dx 1  (0) z dk 1 = 0

consistent with the fact that such factors would cancel corresponding factors we should
include in the functional integration measure. (in other words, since we can always
arrange to have all (0) factors cancel, we ignore them.)

on the other hand, massive tadpoles contribute both divergent and nite pieces

under minimal subtraction: for example, for d = 4  2,
=  (1  d

(see exercise viia2.3b), using a = e ln(a). the  can be killed by using an ms or
g scheme (see subsection viia3): at 1-loop order any version of those schemes has the
eect of just canceling the  (but dierences appear at 2 loops: see subsection viib7
below). to include the  dependence of the coupling, we just replace everywhere (see
also subsection viia3)

ln( 1

2 m2)  ln(cid:18) m2
2(cid:19)

(and similarly for any momentum factors such as ln( 1
2 p2) that might appear more
generally); eectively we are using units 1
2 2 = 1. note that we are not allowed to
taylor expand in m: doing so before integration would give an incorrect result; after
integration its impossible. similar remarks apply to the exponential eikx in a1 if we
interpret it as the denition by fourier transformation of the propagator in position
space.

exercise viib1.1

(but dont taylor expand in x.) note that this fourier transform is innite,
and requires renormalization (of a constant of integration). compare this

with the result obtained by solving the integral form of the klein-gordon
(laplace) equation (i.e., gauss law in d=2).

two-loop tadpole integrals are not much more dicult if one line is massive, or
two are massive with the same mass. (again, tadpoles with only massless lines can be
taken to vanish in dimensional regularization.) if two propagators are massless, then
they can be treated rst as a one-loop propagator graph: by dimensional analysis,
the result of that one-loop subintegral must be a power of the momentum squared.
(the explicit result will be calculated in subsection viib4.) we therefore consider
more general one-loop tadpole integrals with more complicated propagators that may
result from subintegrations in a higher-loop graph. for example, we consider

a1(a, x, m2) =z dk eikx

 (a)

[ 1
2(k2 + m2)]a

using the denition of the  function, we can write

 (a)

[ 1
2 (k2 + m2)]a

=z 

0

d  a1e (k2+m2)/2

performing the resultant gaussian momentum integration and taylor expanding in
x, we easily nd

a more complicated example is

a propagator in an external eld represents a certain class of feynman tree dia-
grams. thus, some tree graphs can be described by quantum mechanics. (in principle
this means we can start from classical mechanics and rst-quantize, by either operator
or path-integral methods. however, as well see in chapter xii, in practice we save
some eort if we start directly with the quantum mechanics.) if we take the ends
of such a propagator and sew them together, we can describe arbitrary 1pi 1-loop
graphs by the background eld method. while tree graphs describe classical eld
theory, one-loop graphs contain many of the important quantum properties, partly
because they are the lowest-order quantum correction, and partly because they are

b. examples

439

associated with the functional determinant part of the (second-quantized) path inte-
gral. (in terms of the exponent, classical is the only negative power in h, 1-loop is
h-independent, and higher loops are positive powers.)

in quantum mechanics, the expansion in h is an expansion in derivatives (since
it appears only as pa = iha). in terms of the contribution of one-loop graphs to
the eective action, this means an expansion in the number of derivatives acting on
the elds. this denition can be applied in general in quantum eld theory, without
reference to quantum mechanics. however, the simplest one-loop calculations of this
expansion are most easily expressed in quantum mechanical terms. in practice, this
means expanding the external elds in x about some xed point, expanding the
exponentiated (by a schwinger parameter) propagator about the part gaussian in p
and x, and using any of the usual methods to exactly evaluate the matrix element of
a polynomial times a gaussian.

since we generally want arbitrary orders in a eld and some of its lower derivatives
for this method to have any advantage over the usual diagrammatic methods, in this
approach one generally cuts o the expansion at the approximation that gives just
the gaussian. this means we can keep up to two derivatives of an external scalar, but
only a constant eld strength for an external gauge vector. (see subsection vib1.)
the simplest, and most useful, example is a constant scalar eld. the part of the
eective action that consists of only scalars without derivatives is called the eective
potential, since it generalizes the potential term of the classical action. this potential
determines the quantum corrections to spontaneous symmetry breaking and the higgs
eect, and this is important for describing mass generation for all spins.

consider a complex scalar running around a loop, under the inuence of an ex-

ternal real scalar. the lagrangian is

l = *[ 1

2( + m2) + ] + l

where the form of l wont be important for calculating the  loop. a constant
external scalar eld is eectively the same as a mass term, modifying m2  m2 + 2.
thus the eective potential in this case can be evaluated by summing tadpoles:

v = 

xn=1

for our complex scalar; for a real scalar running around the loop there would be an
extra factor of 1/2. we can integrate before summing:

since this modies the classical potential, it demonstrates that quantum eects can
generate spontaneous symmetry breaking where there was none classically, or vice
versa (the coleman-weinberg mechanism).

exercise viib2.1

generalize this renormalized result to arbitrary even dimensions.

for more complicated cases we need a more general procedure: the basic idea
is that any gaussian integral gives a (inverse) determinant, of which we must take
(minus) the logarithm for the eective action, and we use ln det = tr ln. (the trace
includes integration over x or p.) after subtracting out the eld-independent part
(vacuum bubble), this gives an expression as above: for a general kinetic operator
h = h0 + ... (generally h0 = 1

 = (cid:2)tr ln(h1)  tr ln(h1

2(p2 + m2)), we want
d

0 )(cid:3) = z 

0

 z dx hx|e h  e h0|xi

h (and h0) is now treated as an operator, in terms of the coordinate operator x
and momentum operator p , and x|xi = x|xi. external elds depend on x, but are
taylor expanded about x: e.g.,

(x) = (x) + (x  x)  (x) + ...

b. examples

441

we then can use translation invariance to write

hx|e h[p,xx,(x)]|xi = h0|e h[p,x,(x)]|0i

when h is quadratic in p and x, we can use (see exercise va2.4)

hx|e h|yi =sdet

2(s)
xy

es

where s is the classical action corresponding to the hamiltonian h. (further
examples will be given in subsection viiib1.)

note that the (one-loop) vacuum bubble, with no background elds of any kind,
must always be dropped, as it is totally meaningless (although how it is subtracted
may be regularization dependent): in terms of the graphs summed here, which have
equal numbers n of propagators and vertices (p v = l1 by the usual h counting),
it is the term n=0. thus, in a coordinate space calculation, where there are also n
integrations ddx, this term would have no propagators, no vertices, and no integrals
(contrary to some statements in the literature, where this graph is misidentied as
a one-propagator graph with one integration). all that remains is the permutation
factor, 1/n, but in this case that is an undened 1/0.

in actual applications, closer examination reveals the used graph to be the cut 1-
loop tadpole (p = v = l = 1). since the cut propagator gives a sum over states, the
result is to evaluate the trace of the operator inserted at the vertex; in particular, a
trivial vertex yields str(i), i.e., the number of states, bosons minus fermions. similar
use can be made of the cut propagator correction (p = v = 2) for (super)traces of
operator products or mass sum rules.

3. dimensional transmutation

the 2d version of the cp(n) model described in subsection iva2 is an interesting
model in that it demonstrates generation of bound states at the one-loop level. its
lagrangian is:

l = 1

2||2 + (||2  1
g2 )

where g is now dimensionless. for the eective potential for the lagrange multiplier
 from a  loop, we nd (modifying the calculation of the previous subsection for
d=2)

v1 = (cid:20)ln(cid:18) 

22(cid:19)  1(cid:21)

1

442

vii. loops

after including the renormalization mass scale  to make the argument of the loga-
rithm dimensionless, and the coupling dimensionless in all dimensions.

now the coupling can be absorbed into the denition of this scale: adding to the

classical term v0 = /g2, the total eective potential for  up to one loop is

v = (cid:20) 1

g2 + ln(cid:18) 

2 2(cid:19)  1(cid:21) = (cid:20)ln(cid:18) 

2m 2(cid:19)  1(cid:21)

1

1

where m is the renormalization group invariant mass scale:

m 2 = 2e1/g2

since this was the only place the coupling g appeared in the action, the mass scale m
has now replaced it completely. this replacement of a dimensionless coupling (g) with
a dimensionful one (m) is called dimensional transmutation. it is also a common
feature of quantum high-energy behavior (see below); its importance at low energies
depends on whether the classical theory already has dimensionful parameters (like
masses).

varying the eective potential to nd the minimum, which we identify as the

(quantum) vacuum value of the eld ,

ln(cid:18) hi

2 m 2(cid:19) = 0  hi = 1

1

2m 2

because  has a vacuum value,  now has a mass (as seen by expanding  about
its vacuum value). furthermore, since  now has more than just linear terms in
the eective action, it is no longer a lagrange multiplier. in fact, by calculating a
massive  loop with two external s, we see that  is now a massive physical scalar
also. without a lagrange multiplier,  is now unconstrained, so it has an additional
physical degree of freedom. this leads to a restoration of the spontaneously broken
u(n) symmetry. this is related to  gaining mass, since we no longer have goldstone
bosons associated with the symmetry breaking. finally, if we calculate a massive 
loop with two external gauge vectors, we see that at low energies there is an f 2 term,
so a is now a physical, massive vector instead of an auxiliary eld.

exercise viib3.1

expand v about hi to show that  gets a mass term. expand (x) to
quadratic order in x according to the prescription of the previous subsection to
calculate the eective action in terms of , , and  (using the harmonic
oscillator result of exercise va2.4) to show that a   term is also generated,
so  becomes propagating.

for the massless one-loop propagator corrections, we also introduce a scaling
parameter to convert to feynman parameters (see the examples of subsection viib1,

the integrals can be simplied if we make use of gauge invariance: for example,

 , so the gauge
the electromagnetic current for a complex scalar is of the form *
eld couples to the dierence of the momenta of the two scalar lines, which is 2k for
the above as applied to the scalar-loop correction to the photon propagator. on the
other hand gauge invariance, or equivalently current conservation, says that such a
vertex factor should give a vanishing contribution when contracted with the external
momentum, which is p in that case. checking this explicitly, we do in fact nd

(even with an arbitrary additional polynomial factor in the numerator), using the
facts that the integral of the sum is the sum of the integrals when regularized, and
that massless tadpoles vanish. (this also tells us that replacing the numerator k  p
with k2 + 1
4p2 gives 0. furthermore, without an extra numerator factor the integral
vanishes by antisymmetry under k  k.) thus, if x is proportional to p in a2, the

only contribution is from the x = 0 term in the taylor expansion. this implies that
the dependence on x is only through the combination

u = (p  x)2  p2x2

so we can evaluate the integral by either of the substitutions

x2  0,

p  x  u

or

p  x  0,

x2  u/p2

well consider now the latter choice. (the former gives the same result: see the
exercise below.) again, since we need to taylor expand in x anyway to nd the result
for a particular numerator, we expand and perform the  integration:

from the csc factor we see the integral is divergent for all even d: these are ultraviolet
divergences for d  4 and infrared ones for d  4; dimensional regularization does
not carefully distinguish between the two, although the dierence can usually be told
by examining momentum dependence (here from the exponent d/2 2). also notice
that the two can be mixed up by the conversion to feynman parameters.

as discussed in subsection viib1, sometimes certain subdiagrams of higher-loop
diagrams can be evaluated explicitly, particularly propagator corrections that them-
selves involve only massless propagators. furthermore, such a formula might be used
recursively in appropriate diagrams. for example, a higher-loop diagram that is itself
a propagator correction might reduce, as a nal integration, to something of the form

5. massive propagators

another way to distinguish infrared divergences is by introducing masses (being
careful not to break any invariances, or restoring them in the massless limit). for
example, we again evaluate the one-loop propagator correction, without numerator
factors, but with dierent masses on the internal propagators. by the same steps as
before, the feynman parameter integral is

now the  integral is harder for all d, but the masses eliminate the ir divergences
(and the uv divergences are already explicit in the  ), so we immediately expand

(we can cancel the  (1 + ) by nonminimal subtraction.) by analytic continuation
from euclidean space, taking p2 from positive to negative along the real axis, we see
there is no ambiguity at p2 = 0 or (m1  m2)2, and a2 remains real until we reach
p2 = (m1 + m2)2, where it gets an imaginary part (whose sign is determined by
(m1 + m2)2  (m1 + m2)2  i), corresponding to the possibility of real 2-particle
intermediate states.

c show both these results agree with the previously obtained massless result in
the limit m  0. however, note that both these cases, unlike the massless
case, are ir convergent at p2 = (m1 + m2)2.

exercise viib5.2

c show this result (in all d) agrees with the result of the explicit phase space

integral of subsection vc7, using the expression forr dd2 from subsection

viia3. (hint: use the identity from exercise viia2.2b.)

d show the massless case agrees with exercise viib4.3.

in subsection viia3 we considered the application of the mom subtraction
scheme to propagator corrections. we assumed the propagator corrections were tay-
lor expandable in the classical kinetic operator. from the above explicit expression
for the 1-loop correction in scalar theories, we see this is possible except near the
branch point at p2 = (m1 + m2)2, i.e., when the external particle (whose propaga-
tor were correcting) has a mass equal to the sum of the internal ones. to analyze
this more carefully, lets recalculate the propagator correction, performing the taylor
expansion before evaluating the integrals. we consider the case with one vanishing
mass, m1 = m, m2 = 0, to generate an ir divergence. assuming the external mass
is also m, we expand around the branch point in p2 + m2. the feynman parameter
integral is then, to linear order in p2 + m2, in terms of  = 1

where we have distinguished the uv divergence (in the  integral for   0) from the
ir one (in the  integral for   0). after including the ( 1
22) in the coupling, the
( 1
2m2) converts each 1/ into a 1/  ln(m2/2). (of course, we can choose  = m
for convenience.) note that this infrared divergence was a consequence of trying to
taylor expand about a branch point due to a massless particle.

exercise viib5.3

do mom subtraction for external mass m = m1 + m2, with neither internal

later, we will encounter propagator corrections in gauge theories with massive
internal lines, and with various numerators. here, we examine these purely from the
point of view of the integrals. first, consider

6. renormalization group

an interesting, useful, and simple application of the propagator correction is to
study the high-energy behavior of coupling constants. for example, we have seen that,
by a change in normalization of gauge elds a  a/g, gauge couplings can be moved
from the covariant derivative to the kinetic term:  =  +iga   +ia, l0 = 1
8(a+
igaa)2  1
8g2 (a + iaa)2. thus, quantum corrections to gauge couplings can be
found from just the propagator (kinetic-operator) correction. a simpler example is a
scalar eld; a 4 self-interaction has a dimensionless coupling in d=4, like yang-mills.
however, unlike yang-mills, this model has no cubic coupling, and thus no 1-loop
propagator correction. furthermore, in yang-mills the one-loop propagator correction
contribution to the eective action gives a multiloop contribution to the propagator
itself, from the expansion of 1/(k + a). this corresponds to the graph consisting of
a long string of these corrections connected by free propagators. there is a 1-loop
4-point correction in 4 theory, and this graph resembles a propagator correction,
but with two external lines at each vertex instead of one. such corrections can also
be strung together, resembling the yang-mills string, but with no free propagators
inserted. since all the intermediate states in this graph are 2-particle, it is 1pi, so the
eect of this string is not contained in just the 1-loop eective action, even though it
is an iteration of a 1-loop eect.

this diculty can be avoided by introducing the 4 interaction through an aux-

iliary eld, just as it appears in supersymmetric theories (see subsection ivc2):

l = 1

2g 2

2( 1

2 + )  1

where we have neglected the mass term since we will be concentrating on the high-
energy behavior. here the coupling is introduced through the auxiliary-eld kinetic
term. the diagrams just discussed now appear through the 1-loop correction to the
auxiliary-eld propagator: since its free propagator is just a constant, it can be
contracted to a point in these multiloop diagrams. the denition of 1pi graphs
has now changed, since we can now cut auxiliary-eld propagators, which would not
exist in the usual 4 form of the action. this modication of the eective action
simplies the analysis of quantum corrections to the coupling, as well as making it
more analogous to gauge theories. note in particular the change in interpretation

452

vii. loops

already at the tree level: we have used the conventional normalization of 1/n! for
factors of n in the potential, since canceling factors of n! arise upon functional
dierentiation. however, the result of eliminating  from the classical action produces
1
84 instead of 1
244. the reason is that in the diagrams with  there are 3 graphs
contributing to the 4--point tree, corresponding to  propagators in the s, t, and u
channels. (see subsection vc4.) although this is a trivial distinction for the trees,
this is not the case for the loops, where the propagator string consists of pairs of 
particles running in one of these three channels.

the contribution to the 1-loop eective action for  is then given by the above
calculations, after including the factors of 1/2 for symmetries of the internal and
external lines, and the usual 1 for the eective action:

l =  1

4 (cid:2) ()b(1  , 1  )( 1

function, and expanding as in previous subsections,

renormalizing away the constant pieces, we nd for the classical action plus this part
of the 1-loop eective action

l + l = 1

m 2 = 2e2/g

thus, the constant coupling 1/g has been replaced by an eective running coupling
 1
2 ln(p2/m 2), with energy dependence set by the scale m. (this is sometimes called
the renormalization group, the group being related to scale invariance, which is
broken by the introduction of the mass scale m.)

we saw the same dimensional transmutation occuring in the eective potential
in massless theories in subsection viib3. the form is similar because both are re-
lated to the appearance of the renormalization mass scale  from the breaking of
scale invariance by quantum corrections, at either low or high energy: in both cases
dimensional transmutation comes from a nite ln 2 term arising from the innite
renormalization. the dierence is that in the eective potential case we ignore higher
derivatives, so the 2 must appear in a ratio to scalar elds, while in the high energy

b. examples

453

case we look at just the propagator correction, so it appears in the combination 2/p2.
(more complicated combinations will appear in more general amplitudes.)

exercise viib6.1

generalize this model to include internal symmetry: write an analog to the
scalar analog to qcd discussed in subsection vc9, where the quark  now
carries color and avor indices, while the gluon  (classically auxiliary)
carries just color. find m, especially its dependence on the numbers n of
colors and m of avors. write the same model with the gluons replaced
by mesons carrying just avor indices (so that classical elimination of the
auxiliary elds yields the same action), and repeat the calculation. what are
the dierent approximation schemes relevant to the two approaches?

7. overlapping divergences

we now perform some 2-loop renormalizations. our rst example is part of the
propagator correction in 4 theory. by restricting ourselves to the mass renormal-
ization (coecient of the mass term), we need evaluate the graph only at vanishing
external momentum. (it is then equivalent to a vacuum bubble in 3 theory, or a
tadpole graph in the mixed theory.) furthermore, we consider the case where some of
the elds are massless. in such a theory, we encounter (a special case of) the 2-loop
graph of subsection viib1, where 1 propagator is massless and 2 are massive. ex-
panding in , and keeping only the divergent terms (1/2 and 1/), we nd (including
a symmetry factor of 1/2 for the 2 massive scalar lines for real scalars)

to this we need to add the counterterm graph, coming from inserting into the
1-loop massive tadpole t1 (with 2 external lines) the counterterm 4 (for renormaliz-
ing the 4 term) from the 1-loop divergence in the 4-point graph with 1 massive and
1 massless propagator. (since the massless tadpole vanishes in dimensional regular-
ization, we need not consider the counterterm from the 4-point graph with 2 massive
propagators.) from section viib5, we use the corresponding integral for a 1-loop
propagator correction a, which is

a =  () + f inite  4 =  ()

we use a modied minimal subtraction, using the  () as the subtraction instead
of just the 1/ part of  ()  1/  .

the 1-loop massive tadpole without coupling is

thus, the ln m2 divergences cancel, as expected. (divergences must be polynomial in
masses as well as couplings.) the surviving divergence is the supercial divergence,
to be canceled by the 2-loop mass counterterm.

exercise viib7.1

calculate the p2 part of the 2-loop kinetic counterterm by writing the above
2-loop propagator graph with nonvanishing external momentum, introducing
the schwinger parameters, doing the loop-momentum integration, taking the

subdivergence (1/2)?

exercise viib7.2

calculate the complete (all graphs, innite and nite parts of the) 2-loop
propagator correction for massless 4. (see exercise viib4.3a.)

for our next example we consider massless 3 theory, and work in 6 dimensions,
where the theory is renormalizable (instead of superrenormalizable, as in 4 dimen-
sions). for the 2-loop propagator correction, there are only two graphs (plus 1-loop

b. examples

graphs with 1-loop counterterm insertions), one of which is simply a 1-loop propagator
graph inserted into another. the other graph is

propagator corrections by use of integration by parts in momentum space. this is
legalized by dimensional regularization, since boundary terms vanish in low enough
dimensions. all invariants can be expressed as linear combinations of the propagator
denominators (there are 5 of each, not counting the square of the external momentum
p2), so any product of momentum times derivative acting on the integrand will give
terms killing one denominator and squaring another, except for p2 terms, which can
be canceled by appropriate choice of the momentum multiplying the derivative:

thus, we can approximate any normalization factor as

n  ea,

a =  + rational

as far as the renormalized results are concerned. (the  identies this normalization
as modied minimal subtraction, as the ms or g schemes.) this is just the statement
of the renormalization group, that the nal result in minimal subtraction schemes
depends only on the choice of scale: the complete normalization factor is really

however, the higher-order terms can be convenient for intermediate stages of the
calculation. in this particular case, the nonlocal divergences appearing before cance-
lation are of the form (1/)ln p2, so the o(2) part of n contributes at intermediate
stages. for example, replacing the original n with

n  = (1  2

3)(1  2) (1  )

would have given the same result even before cancelation, since the change is by
another combination of  s that give 1 + o(3).

so far we have only assumed that connement arises nonperturbatively in 4d
qcd. however, to connect with known, successful results of perturbation theory, we
need to understand how the same methods used to give these perturbative results
can be generalized to include the nonperturbative ones. the simplest method would
be to take the perturbation expansion as is, and nd a good method for evaluating
(or perhaps redening) its sum, with the hope that summation to all orders by itself
would reveal features invisible at nite orders.

besides the technical diculties associated with such an approach, the main prob-
lem is that the summation of the perturbation expansion does not converge. parts of
this problem can be solved by appropriate redenitions, but other parts indicate a se-
rious problem with perturbation theory, caused by the very renormalization that was
supposed to solve the main problem of nite-order perturbation theory (innities).

1. improved perturbation

we saw in the previous section that dimensional transmutation replaced the di-
in principle, we would like to
mensionless coupling constant with a mass scale.
explicitly make this replacement as the basis of our perturbation expansion, not
only to make the perturbative parameter physical, but also to take into account
the running of the original coupling. unfortunately, this is not possible in practice;
however, we can choose the arbitrary (unphysical) renormalization scale  to be in
the range of energies in the problem at hand, so that the ln(p2/2) corrections are
small. a change in scale from one value of  to another is related to a resummation
of graphs: although the one-loop term in the eective action containing ln(p2/2)
comes from a single 1pi amplitude, it contributes an innite number of terms at dif-
ferent loop orders to the propagator when inserted into any higher-loop 1pi graph,
as 1/(k + a) = 1/k  (1/k)a(1/k) + ... . although k + a depends only on m, k
depends only on g and a depends only on . thus, any redenition of  that leaves
the physical quantity m unchanged requires a corresponding redenition of g:

m 2 = 2e1/g2

 g2(2) =

1

m 2(cid:17)
ln(cid:16) 2

and thus changing  redistributes the contributions to 1/(k + a) (and therefore to
the summation of graphs in any amplitude) over the dierent loop orders. for exam-
ple, if the amplitude is most sensitive to the momentum in a particular propagator
(independent of loop momenta), and we choose 2  p2, then although we cant use

c. resummation

461

the resummed perturbation expansion directly, we can at least push most of it into
the lower orders.

things get more complicated at higher loops: it becomes dicult to associate the
running of the coupling with the resummation of a particular subset of all the graphs.
however, we already know that this eect can be derived from the breaking of scale
invariance by renormalization. for example, lets consider yang-mills theory, since
gauge invariance restricts it to have only a single coupling parameter. (this makes
it the simplest case conceptually, although not computationally. here we use only
the fact that it has a single coupling; its explicit renormalization constants wont be
considered until the next chapter. as an alternative, we can consider the scalar qcd
analog of subsections vc9 and viib6, a 4 theory with an auxiliary eld, if we ignore
mass renormalization, or arbitrarily renormalize the mass to zero.) for convenience
of dimensional analysis, we use only coupling constants that are dimensionless in all
dimensions, by scaling with an appropriate power of . (in general, we can do this
even for masses.) the classical yang-mills action, before and after the addition of
counterterms, is then

22 to produce the combination ( 1
22) in graphs. (in practice, one uses units
22 = 1 until the end of the calculation, and restores units.) the  dependence is
then given by varying  for xed g:

2 p2/ 1

2 

2 g2  g2  (g2),

2 

2 g2  0

where the g2 term is the classical contribution,  will be found to be independent of

the physics is independent of the choice of  (i.e., g depends on only m and ). we
then nd

thus, the coecients of the 1/ terms determine those of both the higher order terms
and .

this gives us an expression for ,

xl=1

(g2)l+1l,

l = lc1l

since g2 is itself unphysical, the information we can get from analyzing the running
of this coupling is arbitrary up to redenitions. for example, assume that all l are
nonvanishing, and write the denition of  as (in d = 4   = 0)

(1/g2)(cid:19)1
g2 =(cid:18) (1/g2)

now we consider a perturbative type of redenition, as results from changing renor-
malization prescriptions, so g2 gets only o(h) corrections: taylor expanding

g2 = g2 + k1g4 + +k2g6 + o(g8)

g2 =



we nd

(1/g2)
(1/g2)

= 1 + o(g4),

f (g2(g2)) = f (g2) + o(g4)

 f(g2) = f (g2) + o(g4)

thus, the rst two coecients of  (1 and 2) are unaected, while terms found at 3
loops and beyond can be modied arbitrarily, and even be set to vanish. in the more
general case of more than 1 coupling, it is sometimes possible to eliminate also some
of the 2-loop contributions.

therefore, to consider the general behavior of the coupling as a function of energy

(2), it is sucient to solve the equation

2 

2 g2 = 1g4  2g6

(using, e.g., the change of variables t = ln 2 and u = 1/1g2) as

(this redenition changes the range of what g2 is called negative and what positive.
however, g2 is just a parameter, not a physical coupling: as far as the unitarity of
the kinetic term is concerned, only the residues near the poles of the propagator are
relevant. also, our allowed class of redenitions do not aect behavior for small g2,
and thus perturbation theory.)

exercise viic1.1

lets analyze this solution in more detail:

a graph the function y(x) = eaxxb (or graph ln y to make it simpler) for a
and b positive, negative, and vanishing, to study the behavior of the function
2(g2). the analysis can be simpliifed (and the behavior for dierent values of
a and b related) by considering g2 positive and negative, and the symmetries

note that g2 can be nonpositive for some values of 2: for example, even for
2 = 0, we have g2 = 1/1ln(2/m 2), which is negative for  < m or for
 > m. what happens for 2 6= 0?

find the new  and 2(g2). compare to the behavior of 2(g2) before this
redenition, for the cases 2/1 < 0, noting the duality symmetry g 
(1/2)/g.

exercise viic1.2

consider some theory with a single dimensionless coupling g2, but now also
a single mass m. by the above methods we nd

2
2 m2 = m2[1  m(g2)]

464

vii. loops

(the m dependence follows from dimensional analysis.) solve for m2 as a
function of g2, as an integral over g2 in terms of  and m. show that after
an appropriate redenition

2
2 m2 = m2(1  m1g2)

for some constant m1. solve for m2 explicitly in terms of g2, when we have
also redened  to 1g4 + 2g6. then make the nal redenition 1/g2 
1/g2  2/1 used to simplify m 2.

for purposes of perturbation theory, it is useful to invert this: for small g2, we

have approximately

1
g2  1ln

2
m 2 +

this implies that the terms in the eective action that carry the m dependence are
given by

m 2(cid:19)
ln(cid:18)1ln

m 2(cid:19)(cid:21) f

(we can also replace   in this limit, ignoring is in comparison to lns.)

the general class of coupling redenitions we considered are allowed by pertur-
bation theory: if we knew the exact solution to a eld theory, we would be more
restrictive, requiring invertibility. however, in perturbation theory, given two renor-
malization prescriptions related by some such coupling redenition, we might know
this redenition only perturbatively, and perhaps only to a few orders. even if we
knew it exactly, and knew it to be noninvertible, it still might not be clear which of
the two prescriptions was the correct one, if either. therefore, the renormalization
group alone is sucient to draw conclusions about the behavior of a theory only at
small ( 1) coupling.

similar remarks apply to propagators, s-matrix elements, etc. consider any func-
tion gn appearing as the coecient of n elds in a term in the eective action.
comparing the unrenormalized gn to the renormalized gn,

where z is a wave-function renormalization factor (not required for pure yang-mills

c. resummation

2. renormalons

the perturbation expansion in general cant be resummed in the naive way be-
cause the number of diagrams increases as n!(constant)n at n loops. the simplest

z =z

xn=0

since there is no momentum integration, each diagram is just 1 (times some permu-
tation factors), so zn just counts the number of diagrams at n loops. we use g2 so
the coupling is similar to that in yang-mills: as usual, we can rescale   /g to
recognize g2 as h:

 = g  1

2 2 + 1

4g24 = 1

g2 ( 1

(of course, we can be more explicit by writing hg2 in place of just g2 or h, but the
eect is identical, since they both appear only in that combination.) this integral
can be evaluated exactly at any order of perturbation theory:

zn =z

where we have used the stirling approximation for  (z) at large z.

thus we might as well apply the steepest descent approximation directly to the

original integral: using also an integral for h (= g2 in this case),

466

vii. loops

we rst apply steepest descent to the  integral, yielding the usual rst two terms in
the jwkb expansion. then the h integral can be approximated as  (n) by keeping
only the part of the contour on the positive real axis:

2ihn+1 es/h(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)s/=0

s6=0

(s = 0 solutions contribute only to z0. a similar result can be obtained by simulta-
neously using steepest descent for the h integral, yielding a classical value of h in
terms of s.) in the present case, the nontrivial classical solutions are

s = 1

22 + 1

44   = i

which gives the same zn as previously (being careful to sum the two terms for the

two solutions). thus, we see that in general we have to sumpn=0 n!(h/s)n, which

does not converge. furthermore, this divergence is associated with nite-action (in-
stanton) solutions to the classical equations of motion.

the simplest example of a resummation problem is the one-loop propagator cor-
rection. we have seen that the classical and one-loop kinetic terms can be combined
to give a kinetic operator of the form 1k(p2)ln(p2/m 2) in massless theories, or
at high energy in massive theories, where k is the classical kinetic operator. the
free (or asymptotic) theory has solutions where this kinetic operator has a zero (the
propagator blows up). besides the classical solution at k(p2) = 0, there is another
at p2 = m 2:

this might be expected to be a bound state, called a renormalon because of its rela-
tion to the renormalization group. however, the residue of this pole in the propagator
can have the wrong sign, indicating the appearance of a ghost (landau ghost), and
thus a violation of unitarity.

exercise viic2.2

the landau ghost itself is not necessarily a problem in quantum eld theory,
although it indicates the possibility of such problems. examine the behavior
of this ghost after taking into account the 2-loop correction (2), before and
after the simplifying redenition of the previous subsection, for all the various

signs of 1 and 2. since the expression for 2(g2) cant be inverted, use the
fact that the propagator follows from the coupling g2(2) as

g2(p2)

p2

 

(field redenitions cant remove the momentum dependence of couplings.)

then new poles (or other singularities) in the propagator correspond to the
limit g2  , so nd p2(g2) there.

this causes problems similar to those from instantons when the quantum prop-

agator is inserted into another graph. we set external momenta to vanish, as an

approximation for high energy for the loop momenta, or to evaluate low-energy quan-

tities such as anomalous magnetic moments. in any one-loop 1pi graph with n 1-loop

propagator insertions and l external lines, we get an integral at high energy of the form

(e.g., in qcd or the scalar analog with auxiliaries of subsections vc9 and viib6)

where we changed variables to u = ln(k2/2) (remembering  (n + 1) = n!). we
have used eectively an infrared cuto by approximating the u-integral from 0 to 
instead of  to . if we look instead at the low-energy (of the loop momentum)
behavior, now taking l  1 massive classical propagators with 1 massless propagator
(to insure ir convergence) with n insertions, we nd

since the former comes from uv behavior its called a uv renormalon, while the

latter coming from ir behavior is called an ir renormalon. the essential dierence
is the relative factor of (1)n. in fact, the former expression is also the high-energy
limit of the latter (neglecting masses then), so the complete integral (u from  to
, so k2 from 0 to ) can be approximated as the sum of the uv renormalon and
ir renormalon contributions.

468

vii. loops

3. borel

since renormalons and instantons cause the perturbation expansion to diverge by
a factor of n!, we look for a method to formally sum such series, by relating them to
series that do converge. in general, we consider the series

a(h) =

hnan

xn=0

and dene the borel transform as:

a(z) =z r+i

ri

d(1/h)

2i

ez/ha(h)

(for some real number r to the right of all singularities of a) in anticipation of
instanton-like contributions. the inverse is

a(h) =z 

0

dz ez/h a(z)

the inverse borel transform is related to the laplace transform (with the variable
change x = 1/h) and the mellin transform (x = 1/h and y = ez). evaluating explicitly
for the above series,

a(z) = (z)a0 +

zn 1

n!an+1

xn=0

so the borel-transformed sum converges faster by a factor of n!, which is just what
we need for perturbation theory. the idea for resumming the perturbation expansion
is to rst do the borel sum, then inverse borel transform the resulting function. of
course, this procedure does not necessarily x the original problem, which might
merely be translated into problems of convergence or ambiguity for integration of the
inverse transform. in particular, we need a(z) to be well dened along the positive
real axis.

we saw that generically the sums involved were approximately of the form

a(h) 

hn(n  1)!(k)n

xn=1
xn=0

in that case

a(z) 

(1)nznkn+1 =

1

z + 1
k

when k < 0, this leads to a singularity in the integral dening the inverse borel
transform. it can be regularized by choosing a contour that goes around the pole,

c. resummation

469

but the choice of contour is ambiguous, and choosing an arbitrary linear combination
of the two contours introduces a free parameter. explicitly, we have

a(h) = a0(h) + e1/|k|h

where a0 is the result of a particular prescription (e.g., principal value), and  is the
new parameter. the  term is clearly nonperturbative, since each term in its taylor
expansion in h vanishes. this new parameter can be interpreted as a new (nonper-
turbative) coupling constant in the theory, just like ambiguities in renormalization of
new counterterms in perturbatively nonrenormalizable theories.

d(1/h)

now we more carefully analyze the explicit sums we found in the previous sub-

ez/hz 



es/h =z 

section. the rst example is hz for d=0:
a(z) =z r+i
(the contribution from s = 0 is articial, coming from our using a = hz instead
of z.) so, this integral can be explicitly evaluated. (for example, for the action we
used in the previous subsection, we can explicitly solve for  at s = z.) however,
there is then a problem in inverting the borel transform: near z = z0  s(0) for
classical solutions 0, we have

2xs=z

(z  s) =

2 s(0)(0)2

 (s)1  [2s(0)]1/2(z  z0)1/2

therefore, there are cuts with branchpoints at classical values of the action, leading
to ambiguities in the result for a(h). we thus see that new coupling constants are
introduced for each solution to the classical eld equation with positive action. (for
our d=0 example s < 0, and there is no problem, but more realistic examples, like
yang-mills instantons, have s > 0.)

exercise viic3.1

consider the d=0 action

s = 1

which diers from our previous example by the sign of the interaction. now
we have classical solutions with s > 0. (the interaction is the wrong sign for
the integral to be well dened, but the kinetic term is the right sign for it
to be dened perturbatively.) explicitly evaluate (s) (i.e., (z)), and show
it has the above behavior near z = s(0).

470

vii. loops

in the case of renormalons, we see from the previous subsection that the large-n
behavior gives singularities at z = n/1 for positive integer n. this integral also is
easier to evaluate after borel transforming: we consider a one-loop graph, but replace
one internal line with the full quantum propagator coming from the 1-loop eective
action (the same as summing a string of 1-loop propagator insertions), while using
massive propagators for the remaining lines. we thus examine rst the transform of
the quantum propagator

using the integrals of the subsection viib1. this expression is the sum over n of
the uv/ir renormalon example at the end of the previous subsection, except that
we have done the summation over n as the rst step (and used the borel transform
to assist in the evaluation). the rst  has poles at z = n/1 for positive n,
representing the ir renormalon, which are relevant for 1 > 0, but the second  has
poles at z = (n + l  3)/1 for positive n (and l  3 for the original diagram to be
uv convergent), representing the uv renormalon, which are relevant for 1 < 0. to
the one-loop approximation for the -function we have used, the singularities are just
poles, but if the two-loop propagator insertions are used, these singularities become
the branchpoints for cuts.

the new coupling constants that appear nonperturbatively can be given a physical
interpretation in terms of vacuum values of polynomials of the elds. the basic idea
is analogous to perturbative tadpoles: in that case corrections to s-matrices due to
vacuum expectation values of scalar elds can be expressed by propagators that end
at a one-point vertex, whose coecient is the vacuum value of the eld:

in position space for some constant c, or in momentum space as

h(x)i =z d eis(x) = c
z d eis(p) = c(p)

similarly, we could expect graphs to have two propagators that end at a two-point
vertex representing the vacuum value of the product of the two elds associated with

c. resummation

471

the ends of the two propagators, and so on for higher-point vertices. for example,
for a 2 vertex in a scalar theory, it would correspond to a contribution of the form

in position space, or in momentum space

z d eis(x)(y) = (c2 + c) + ...
z d eis(p)(q) = (c2 + c)(p)(q) + ...

where c2 is the contribution from hi2, so c represents ()2 = h2i  hi2. such
vacuum values do not appear in perturbation theory for higher than one-point; we get
only one (p) for each connected part of any graph. however, such contributions would
be expected to give similar contributions to those we have found for renormalons: by
dimensional transmutation, a contribution to an amplitude of the form en/1h must
appear in the combination

en/1h  en/1h(cid:18) 2
p2(cid:19)n

p2 (cid:19)n
= (cid:18)m 2

this is the type of contribution expected from a propagator with tadpole insertions,
or in the same way from any other type of vacuum value.
in particular, in qcd
there are no fundamental scalar elds, but only scalar elds can get vacuum values,
by lorentz invariance. thus, the vacuum values come from composite scalars, like
tr(f 2), qq, etc.

note that renormalons are a feature of renormalizable theories: they do not
appear in superrenormalizable or nite theories.
in particular, the path-integral
methods of constructive quantum eld theory have been used to show that cer-
tain interacting eld theories in lower dimensions can be proven rigorously to exist
 superrenormalizable theories with unique vacuua.

4. 1/n expansion

perturbation theory is insucient to evaluate all quantities in quantum physics,

since

(1) such expansions dont always converge;

(2) if they do converge, they might not converge to the complete result; and

(3) even if they do give the complete answer, their summation might not be practical.

there are many perturbative expansions in quantum eld theory. when we say
perturbation theory in this context, we generally mean an expansion in the number

472

vii. loops

of elds (or, in diagrammatic terms, number of vertices), since in the path integral
we kept the exact quadratic part of the action but expanded in powers of the inter-
action terms (cubic and higher). (this is usually also an expansion in the coupling
constants, depending on how we dene the elds, which can be redened by factors
of the couplings.) one disadvantage of this expansion is that it violates manifest
gauge invariance: nonabelian gauge transformations are nonlinear in the elds, and
thus mix diagrams with dierent numbers of elds. (these are the internal elds;
external elds are asymptotic, and approximated as free.) graphs that are related by
gauge transformations must be added together to obtain gauge-invariant, and thus
physically meaningful, expressions. also, in practice individual graphs contain gauge
artifacts that complicate them in certain gauges, but cancel in gauge-invariant ob-
jects, like s-matrix elements.

there can be a large number of graphs contributing to a particular physical
process (given set of external states) at any particular loop order. there is another
gauge-invariant expansion that can be applied to yang-mills theory to subdivide these
sets of graphs, based on the freedom of choice of the yang-mills group itself: we
have seen that the classical groups are dened in terms of nn matrices, where n is
arbitrary. clearly, s-matrix elements must depend on n, even if the external states are
restricted to be group singlets or representations of an n-independent subgroup, since
the number of internal states increases as some polynomial in n. we now examine
how this can be used to dene a perturbation expansion in terms of n.

n

we have already seen in subsection vc9 that the group theory of any graph can
be detached from the momentum and spin (so we considered there a simple model
of scalars ). we also saw there that the group theory of such matrices is most con-
veniently graphed by a double-line notation, where each line acts group-theoretically
as a bound (anti)quark, reducing the group theory to trivial kronecker s. we now
notice that in some loop graphs, depending on how the lines are connected, some of
the quark lines form closed loops. again the group theory is trivial: there is a factor
of n for each such loop, from the sum over the n colors. we can also give a physical
picture to these numerical factors: since we draw the scalar propagator as quark and
antiquark lines with nite separation, think of the scalar as a (very short) string,

c. resummation

473

with a quark at one end and antiquark at the other. this gives a two-dimensional
structure to the diagram, by associating a surface with the area between the quarks
and antiquarks (including the area at the vertices). we can extend this picture by
associating a surface also with the area inside (i.e., on the other side of) each closed
quark loop. in particular, for any planar diagram, i.e., any diagram that can be
drawn on a sheet of paper without crossing any lines, and with all external lines on
the outside of the diagram, the entire diagram forms an open sheet without holes,
and with the topology of a disc (simply connected). it is also clear that, for a xed
number of loops and a xed number of external lines, a planar diagram has the great-
est number of factors of n, since crossing lines combines quark loops and reduces the
power of n.

we can be more quantitative about this n dependence, and relate it to the topol-
ogy of the graph. in subsection vc2 we saw the number of propagators, vertices, and
loops were related by p  v = l  1. this relation treats a feynman diagram as
just a graph, points connected by lines. we now consider a diagram as a polyhedron,
with propagators as the edges, and closed quark loops as the faces, as dened by our
use of matrices for elds. we then have as an additional relation for closed surfaces
eulers theorem,

f = p  v  2(h  1)

(in terms of the euler number   2(h  1) = v  p + f ), where f is the
number of faces and h is the number of handles: 0 for the sphere, 1 for the torus
(doughnut), etc. this follows from the previous relation: first combining them as

l = f + 2h  1

we note that cutting any handle along a loop (without separating the pieces) pro-
duces 2 faces; in other words, introducing two faces (as a lens) into a loop that
circles a handle changes the surface without changing the diagram, replacing 1 han-
dle with 2 faces. the last relation then follows from the case with no handles, where
each face gives a loop, except that the no-loop case corresponds to 1 face (or start
with a less trivial case, like a cube, if thats easier to picture and count momenta for).

using the fact that the g2 appears in yang-mills the same way as h, and that

each face gets a factor of n, we nd the g and n dependence of any graph is

(g2)l1n (l1)2(h1) = (ng2)l1n2(h1)

we thus see that eectively ng2 is the coupling squared suited to planar graphs,
counting the number of loops, while 1/n 2 is a new coupling squared, counting the

474

vii. loops

number of handles. therefore, we can sum over both ng2 and 1/n 2: each feynman
graph is a particular order in each of these two couplings. the sum of all graphs at
xed orders in both couplings gives a gauge-invariant subset of the graphs contribut-
ing to a particular s-matrix element. (this is sometimes called color decomposition.
note that g2 is the coupling normalized for matrices of the dening representation,
which was required here to dene the 1/n expansion, while ng2 = 1
a is the coupling
normalized for the adjoint: if we had used matrices for the adjoint representation, a
factor 1/g2
a would appear in front of the action, because of the dierence in normal-
ization of the trace of the matrices.)

2 g2

exercise viic4.1

consider 4 theory in d=4, where  is now an nn hermitian matrix. gener-
alize the auxiliary-eld propagator correction calculation of subsection viib6
to leading order in 1/n, showing the n-dependence at all steps. show that
now, to this leading order, both the n- and g-dependence of the eective
action can be absorbed into m.

we can also consider more complicated models, such as chromodynamics, with
elds appearing in the dening representation of the group, such as quarks. when
a quark eld makes a closed loop, it looks like a planar loop of a gluon, except that
the closed quark line is missing, along with a corresponding factor of n. thus, there
is eectively a hole in the surface. since only one factor of n is missing, a hole
counts as half a handle. we can also draw a avor-quark line for the quark propagator
alongside the color-quark line. since this line closes in quark-eld loops, we also get
a factor of m (for m avors) for each quark loop.

the fact that the 1/n expansion is topological (the power of 1/n is the number
of holes plus twice the number of handles) closely ties in with the experimental ob-
servation that hadrons (in this case, mesons) act like strings. thus, we can expand
in 1/n as well as in loops. while the leading order in the loop (ng2) expansion is
classical (particle) eld theory, the leading order in the 1/n expansion is classical
open-string theory (planar graphs). however, seeing the dynamical string properties
requires summing to all orders in ng2 for leading order in 1/n.

thus, 1/n acts as the string coupling constant. (n appears nowhere else in the
action describing string states, since they are all color singlets.) the experimental fact
that the hadronic spectrum and scattering amplitudes follow so closely that of a string
(more on this later) indicates that the perturbative expansion in 1/n is accurate, i.e.,
that quantum corrections are small in that sense. one application of the smallness
of 1/n (largeness of n) is the okubo-zweig-iizuka rule: a planar graph describes

c. resummation

475

classical scattering of open strings (mesons). it corresponds topologically to a disc,
which is a sphere with one hole, and is therefore order 1/n. compare this to two
planar graphs connected by a handle. it describes classical scattering of open strings
with one intermediate closed string (glueball), where the handle is a closed-string
propagator connecting two otherwise-disconnected classical open-string graphs.
it
corresponds to a cylinder, which is a sphere with two holes, and is therefore order
1/n2.
in terms of avor lines, the latter graph diers from the former in that it
has an intermediate state (the glueball) with no avor lines. the ozi rule is that
amplitudes containing an intermediate glueball are always smaller than those with an
intermediate meson. this rule also has been veried experimentally, giving a further
justication of the 1/n expansion (though not necessarily of string behavior).

generalizing to groups so(n) and usp(2n) gives more varied topologies: since
the left and right sides of propagators are no longer distinguishable, the string surface
is no longer orientable (the surface no longer has two distinguishable sides), so we
can also have unorientable surfaces such as mobius strips and klein bottles. one can
also perform a separate expansion in the number m of avors.

the fact that the leading (planar) contributions are of order (ng2)l1 requires a

modication of the borel transform of the previous subsection: we now identify

h = ng2

instead of just h = g2, so we can use the 1/n expansion in conjunction with the borel
transform. in particular, this means removing the factor of n from 1 and absorbing
it into h. the result is that the position of the renormalon singularities in the z plane
is independent of n. however, the same is not true for the instantons: a one-instanton
solution corresponds to choosing a single component of  nonvanishing in our scalar
model, so that the classical solution 0 for the action s[0] has no n-dependence.
(choosing  proportional to the identity matrix yields an n-instanton solution.) the
analog in the yang-mills case is using just a (s)u(2) subgroup of the full u(n) to
dene the instanton. (note that the structure constants for u(n) are n-independent
for the dening representation: see exercise ib5.2.) then s/g2 = ns/h. the result
for the positions of the singularities in z is then at integer multiples (positive or
negative, depending on considerations given in the previous subsection) of z0, where

z0 =(cid:26) 1/1

ns[0]

for renormalons
for instantons

where 1 and the one-instanton action s are n-independent.

476

vii. loops

the net result is that instantons are unimportant for large n. thus, if we take
the 1/n approach of using a resummation to dene a string theory, the instantons
do not take a role in dening the string. (they might return in another form when
considering classical solutions to the string theory, or their contribution might be
just a small part of the total nonperturbative contribution.) on the other hand,
approaches that analyze just the low-energy behavior of a theory can make use of the
instantons: if the physical value of n is small, or the u(n) theory is spontaneously
broken to give a small eective n at low energies (as in guts), then instantons may
be treated as the dominant nonperturbative contribution to low-energy eects such
as chiral symmetry breaking. this can be sucient for studying low-energy bound
states, but is insucient for studying connement, whose physical denition is the
existence of bound states of very high energy.

gauge invariance plays an important role in quantum corrections.

it not only
simplies their form, but leads to new eects.
in particular, it not only improves
high-energy behavior, but can eliminate divergences altogether, in the presence of
supersymmetry.

in general, the rst thing to calculate in quantum eld theory is the eective
action. once this has been calculated, other properties can be determined:
the
vacuum, s-matrix, etc. in particular, in spontaneously broken theories, the eective
action should be calculated with the symmetric (unbroken) vacuum, which has simpler
feynman rules; once the eective action has been calculated, vacuum values of the
elds can be determined, and the s-matrix can be calculated as a perturbation about
this quantum vacuum. (the alternative of dening feynman rules for the classical
broken vacuum and then calculating quantum corrections doubles the work in nding
vacuum values.)

we rst consider propagator corrections in some specic theories with spin. in
the following calculations we assume the gauge coupling appears only as an overall
factor in the classical action: it thus also counts loops, so our 1-loop graphs are
coupling-independent. all the integrals have been performed in subsections viib4-5;
all that remains is the numerator algebra, which follows the examples of subsection
vic4. as we have seen, such corrections are important in analyzing high-energy
behavior; as well see in the following section, they are also important for low energy.
(of course, for massless particles the two are related by conformal invariance, even
when quantum corrections break it.)

in subsection viib5 we considered mom subtraction (see subsection viia3) for
scalar propagators. the analysis in this case is similar, but now we expand in p/
instead of p2:

k = a + b( m2  p/) + o[( m2  p/)2]

however, since k is normally expressed as functions of p2 times 1 and p/, we need
to translate: using ( m2

2(p2 + m2),

+ p/)( m2  p/) = 1

k = a + b( m2  p/) + c 1

2 (p2 + m2) + o[( m2  p/)(p2 + m2), (p2 + m2)2]

= a + (b + 2 m2

c)( m2  p/) + o[( m2  p/)2]

we next reevaluate the fermion propagator correction, to linear order in m2  p/.

this propagator correction is easier to analyze in the mom scheme than the
electron propagator, since there are no internal massless particles, and thus no ir
divergence to distinguish from the uv one. we therefore just take the explicit ex-
pressions for the integrals from subsection viib5 and taylor expand in p2 about 0

the most interesting case is the propagator of the yang-mills eld, in a theory

of yang-mills coupled to lower spins. there is an important simplication in this

calculation in the background eld gauge: writing the classical yang-mills lagrangian
as tr f 2/g2, the covariant derivative appears as  = +ia without coupling constant,
so the gauge transformation of a is coupling independent, as in general for the matter
elds. (in terms of a group element g,  = g and  = gg1.) the eective action
is gauge invariant, which means the only divergent terms involving the yang-mills

eld are the gauge-covariantized kinetic (less mass) terms of the various elds. the

divergences for the non-gauge elds are not so interesting, since they can be absorbed

by rescaling those elds (wave-function renormalization), but the divergence of
the tr f 2/g2 term can be absorbed only by rescaling the coupling g itself. (on the
other hand, if we use  =  + iga, then renormalization of g requires the opposite
renormalization of a to preserve gauge invariance.) thus this divergence is related

to the uv behavior of this coupling (as discussed in subsection viib6, and further
later). the important point is that there is no wave-function renormalization for the

yang-mills eld (since there is no corresponding gauge-invariant counterterm), so the

coupling-constant renormalization (like mass renormalizations) can be found from

just the propagator correction, while in other gauges one would need also a much
messier vertex (3-point) correction: brst invariance is not enough to give the result

from a single graph.

a. propagators

we now consider the contributions of spins 0 (including ghosts) and 1 (including
gluon self-interactions), and redo the spin-1/2 contribution in a way that resembles
the bosons. it is based on the observation that there is a universal form for the gauge-
covariantized klein-gordon equation for spins 0,1/2,1, which can also be shown by
supersymmetry. the kinetic operator in a background yang-mills eld is

k =  1

2 (  if absba)

where now = ()2 is gauge covariantized. this form is true in arbitrary dimensions.
for spin 0 it is obvious. for spin 1/2, we use the fact that the one-loop contribution
to the functional integral is the trace of the logarithm of the propagator, as follows
from gaussian integration,

z d d  e k = det k = etr ln k

where the trace is over all indices, including the coordinates. then the contribution
to the eective action from kinetic operator k is 1/2 the contribution from k 2. (see
also exercise via4.2.) we then use (see subsection iiic4)

2/ 2 = 2(  )2 = ({a, b} + [a, b])ab = + isabfab

where we have used

s(1/2)
ab =  1

2 [ab],

{a, b} = ab

in the case d=4, this is equivalent to the result obtained in subsection iiic4 in terms
of just the undotted spinor, but there the 1/2 is automatically included because there
are half as many elds, so the range of the trace is half as big.

for spin 1, we use the result of the background-eld version of the fermi-feynman

gauge: at quadratic order in the quantum elds, from exercise vib8.1 we have

where
have written the quantum eld a as a column vector in the group space and the

viii. gauge loops

background elds (like f ) as matrices for the adjoint representation (which replaces
commutators with multiplication), and used the explicit expression

s(1)
ab = |[aihb]|,

ha|bi = ab

to this order in the quantum elds, the kinetic operator for the two ghosts looks just
like that for two physical scalars, but gives a contribution to the eective action of
opposite sign because of statistics.

this method can be used for arbitrary one-loop graphs with external gluons,
and easily generalizes to massive elds; we now specialize to propagator corrections.
there are two kinds of vertices, the spin-0 kind and the vertex with the spin operator.
since tr sab = 0, we get only graphs with either 2 spin vertices or none. there is
only one spin graph, with 2 internal free propagators; the 2 spinless graphs include
such a graph but also a tadpole, which vanishes by dimensional regularization in the
massless case. since the spinless graphs give the complete result for internal spin-0,
their sum is separately gauge invariant; the spin graph is obviously so, since it is
expressed directly in terms of the eld strength. (we refer here to the abelian part
of the gauge invariance, which is all you can see from just 2-point graphs.) as far
as lorentz index algebra is concerned, we need to evaluate only tr(sabscd). for the
vector, we have

tr(s(1)

ab s(1)

cd ) = 2b[cd]a

for spin 1/2, the traces are the same as in d=4 except for overall normalization;
using earlier identities, or using the same methods for this case directly,

lets look at other ways to interpret the last two identities:

a use the double-line notation (subsection vc9) for the dening representation
of the orthogonal group to derive the above expression for the trace of two
s(1)s.

b use the fermion action of iiic4 in terms of just undotted spinors for d=4.

all diagrams will also have a group-theory factor of tr(gigj)  ij. well be
interested mostly in su(n) for yang-mills theory (as appropriate to describe color in
the standard model for n=3, or arbitrary n for applying the 1/n expansion). then
the most interesting representations are the adjoint (for the gluons and their ghosts)
and the dening (for the quarks). as explained in subsection ib2, or as follows from
the double-line notation of subsection vc9, we use the normalization

trd(gigj) = ij  tra(gigj) = 2nij

2  1

finally, there are the momentum-space integrals, which have already been eval-
uated in subsection viib4 for the massless case (which is sucient for determining
the high-energy behavior, and thus the uv divergences) and viib5 for the massive
case. the integral for the spin graph is the same as that for 3 theory (using the sab
vertex from  1
2if absab). as labeled there, the external line has momentum p
and the internal lines k  1
2p. then the vertex factors in the spinless graph with two
propagators are both simply k (from  1
2a2),
giving aab, while the addition of the tadpole, with vertex factor , converts it to
aab. (by comparison, the tadpole graph that was apparently avoided in the dirac-
spinor calculation of the previous subsection appeared anyway after evaluating the
trace algebra.) this contribution also gets an overall tr(i) factor, simply counting
the number of degrees of freedom. note that the scalar factor a that appears in aab
is the sum of a divergent term proportional to the 3 graph and a convergent term
that vanishes in the massless case.

we now combine all factors to obtain the contributions to the two-gluon part of
the unrenormalized 1-loop eective action (including the 1 for getting the eective
action from the s-matrix, a 1 for internal fermions, either spin 1
2 or ghost, the 1

for identical external gluon lines, the 1
2 for the spinor to compensate for squaring the
propagator, and yet another 1

this result applies to spins s = 0, 1
for two polarizations, so there is an implicit extra factor of 1

2 for a single scalar,

486

viii. gauge loops

while for massive spin 1 (spontaneously broken gauge theories) the third polarization
in the (background-eld) fermi-feynman gauge is carried by a scalar eld.
(the
result above for s=1 is the sum of the contributions from the vector eld and the two
fermionic ghosts.) the functions b1 and b2 are the spinless and spin contributions,
related to the massive 3 propagator correction a2(p2, m2, m2) as

b2(p2) = a2(p2, m2, m2), b1(p2) = b2(p2) + 4m2b2(p2)  b2(0)

p2

note that

b1  b2  1

as far as divergent (at d=4) or high-energy (i.e., massless) terms are concerned. also
note that all contributions exactly cancel if all spins are in the adjoint and have the
same mass, and appear in the ratio 1:4:6 for spins 1 (including ghosts), 1
2, 0: for the
massless case, this is n=4 super yang-mills, which is also the massless sector of the
dimensional reduction of the open superstring from d=10. the massless sector of
the reduction of the open bosonic string from d=26 yields yang-mills plus 22 adjoint
scalars, which cancels near d=4 up to nite terms.

in examining the contribution of this term to the running of the coupling constant
with energy, we see that the vectors contribute with opposite sign to lower spins. in
particular, in terms of the coecient 1 (of subsection viic1), only nonabelian vec-
tors make positive contributions (since abelian vectors are neutral). this means that
nonabelian vectors are responsible for any weakening in a coupling at high energies,
known as asymptotic freedom, an important experimental feature of the strong
interactions (see section viiic). note that while the sign of 1 for 4 theory, using
the method of subsection vc9, is independent of the coupling (since all 1-loop correc-
tions are coupling-independent when the coupling appears as an overall factor in the
classical action, like h), changing the sign of the coupling changes its sign relative to
1: the result is that this theory can be made asymptotically free only if its potential
has the wrong sign (negative for large ). thus, although nonabelian vectors are
required for asymptotic freedom in physical theories, wrong-sign 4 can be used
as a toy model for studying features associated with asymptotic freedom (especially
resummation of the perturbation expansion: see section viic).

note that for (massless) fermions that couple chirally to vectors (as in electroweak
interactions), cr consists of the contribution from a complex representation but not its
complex conjugate: only one of the two weyl spinors of the dirac spinor contributes.
the result is that the contribution to the vector propagator is half that of the parity-
invariant case. this fact follows from comparing the calculations of the chiral and

a. propagators

487

nonchiral cases without the squared-propagator trick: in dirac (4-component) spinor
notation, the 1s drop out of the calculation; in weyl (2-component) spinor notation,
the left- and right-handed-spinor diagrams are identical except for (internal) group
theory. (things are more complicated for higher-point functions, because the group
theory gives more than just trr(gigj): see subsection viiib3.)

exercise viiia3.2

find the conditions for exact cancelation if spins 1
2 and 0 include both adjoint
and dening representations. find the weaker conditions if only the divergent
(and therefore also high-energy) terms cancel.

exercise viiia3.3

boson) into massive particle-antiparticle pairs of various spins.

exercise viiia3.4

find the propagator correction for internal particles of dierent masses on

in the case of qcd, with color gauge group su(nc) and nf avors of quarks in
the dening representation of color, the divergent and high-energy contributions to
this term in the unrenormalized 1-loop eective action are

1,2g,qcd  h trz dx 1

8f ab 1

3(2nf  11nc)( 1

  ln

)fab

at higher loops the eective action will still be gauge invariant in background-eld
gauges (for the quantum elds), so the renormalization of the yang-mills coupling
can still be determined from just the gluon propagator correction. on the other hand,
in other gauges a three-point vertex must also be calculated: it can be shown that
the gauge-xed classical action, including counterterms, is brst invariant only up
to wave-function renormalizations; i.e, the most general counterterms needed (with
a brst preserving regularization) are brst-invariant terms with additional mul-
tiplicative renormalizations of the quantum elds. thus, brst invariance, unlike
gauge invariance, is not strong enough to relate the gluon coupling and wave-function
renormalizations. not only does this mean evaluating many more graphs, but graphs
which make the propagator correction look easy by comparison. (this is not so dif-
cult for just the one-loop divergences we have considered, but the diculty grows
exponentially with the number of loops.)

however, in the background-eld gauge the l-loop propagator correction has
(l  1)-loop vertex subdivergences, similar to those in other gauges. the net re-
sult is: (1) we still have a brst-invariant classical action, containing the same

488

viii. gauge loops

(counter)terms that appear in other gauges (including quantum ghosts), but covari-
antized with respect to background gauge elds (and including coupling to other
background elds). however, the coecients need be calculated only to order l  1
for the l-loop eective action, one loop less than in other gauges. (2) in addition,
we have background-eld-only terms in the classical action whose l-loop coecients
do need to be calculated, but with a relatively small amount of additional eort,
due to gauge invariance. thus renormalization consists of two steps: (1) adding
brst-invariant counterterms for the quantum elds (background covariantized) to
cancel subdivergences, and (2) adding gauge-invariant counterterms for the back-
ground elds (which can be interpreted as vacuum renormalization for the quantum
elds) to cancel supercial divergences. consequently, background-eld gauges save
about one loop of diculty as far as renormalization is concerned. furthermore,
similar simplications occur for calculations of nite parts (e.g., eective potentials),
because of simplications from gauge invariance.

4. grand unied theories

the best result of guts is their prediction that the gauge couplings of the stan-
dard model coincide at some high energy, as a consequence of the running of the
couplings with energy. (mixed results have been obtained for masses, arguably be-
cause renormalization group arguments are accurate only for high energies, and thus
leptons with large masses. a failed prediction is proton decay, which has already
eliminated the nonsupersymmetric su(5) model with minimal higgs.) the numerical
details of this prediction are model dependent (and thus easy to fudge, given enough
freedom in choice of nonminimal elds), but the fact that all three couplings come
close together at high energies is already strong evidence in favor of unication.

thus we make only the crudest form of this calculation, using only the one-loop
results of the previous subsection. the main assumption is that there is a desert
between the standard model unication scale (around the masses of the intermediate
vector bosons w and z) and the grand unication scale mgu t , with no fundamental
particles with masses in that range (although, of course, a huge number of hadrons
appear there). this allows us to crudely approximate all fundamental particles below
that region (i.e., those of the standard model) as massless, and all above as innitely
massive. in particular, in the framework of the minimal su(5) gut, this means all
the fermions are treated as massless.

therefore the calculation is to use the one-loop results to calculate the running
of the couplings in the standard model, and use the relation of the gauge couplings

a. propagators

489

in the su(5) gut to identify those of the standard model in terms of that of this
gut. from the previous subsection, the running of the couplings is given by

the result is not very accurate, since we have made many approximations, which
can be improved with some eort: two-loop corrections add ln ln terms to the one-
loop ln terms; including the mass dependence of the eective couplings also adds
signicant corrections. but the most important approximation assumption we made
was the desert: undiscovered particles, such as new fermions, nonminimal higgs, or
supersymmetric partners, change even the one-loop expressions 1. specically, since
by denition the unication scale is where the masses of all unobserved vectors reside,
these new particles will all have spins 0 or 1

5. supermatter

although the problem with infrared renormalons may be only technical, the ap-
pearance of this same problem in several dierent approaches (including a nonpertur-
bative one; see later) strongly suggests that the correct approach to quantum eld
theory, in the sense of a practical method for unambiguously (i.e., with predictive
power) calculating perturbative and nonperturbative eects, might be to consider
only theories that are perturbatively nite. in this subsection we will analyze gen-
eral properties of supersymmetric eld theory using superspace, and in particular
improved uv behavior, concentrating on nite theories.

finite supersymmetric theories must be in particular one-loop nite. this turns
out to be enough to guarantee niteness to all loops: two-loop niteness is automatic,
while an appropriate renormalization prescription is required to guarantee niteness
is preserved order by order in perturbation theory. (no constraints on the coupling
constants are needed beyond those found at one loop, but without the renormalization
prescription innities cancel between dierent loop orders.) of course, wave-function
renormalizations are gauge dependent: n=1 supersymmetric gauges eliminate some
of these unphysical divergences (and gauges with higher supersymmetry more), as
do background-eld gauges even in nonsupersymmetric theories. so, nite theory
in general gauges refers only to the physical divergences  those that aect the
high-energy behavior of the theory, namely those that appear in couplings and masses.

because of the nonrenormalization of chiral terms in the action (see subsection
vic5), it might seem that the corresponding couplings and masses are always un-
renormalized. however, the kinetic terms of chiral superelds can receive quantum
corrections, and the true couplings are dened by eld redenitions that eliminate
these rescalings. this means that all such renormalizations are related, and given
by the wave function renormalizations. the only other couplings are the yang-mills

492

viii. gauge loops

ones, whose renormalization is also given by kinetic terms in background-eld gauges.
thus, all physical renormalizations in supersymmetric theories can be found from
just propagator corrections. in particular, this means that if the eective action is
calculated with background-eld supergraphs, then it is completely nite in a nite
theory.

a possible exception to our statement of all physical renormalizations coming from

propagator corrections would seem to be the fayet-iliopoulos tadpole termr d4 v .

however, massless tadpoles vanish in dimensional regularization, and massive ones
require real representations, which cannot generate explicit-prepotential terms. (in
particular, at more than one loop such terms never appear in the background-eld
gauge for any representation.)

the simplest one-loop propagator correction is to . (the  correction van-

ishes, since r d4 2 = 0: see subsection vic5.) there are two graphs to consider,
one with two internal  propagators, and one with internal  and v v propagators.
the d algebra for the two graphs is identical: both get a d2 and a d2 inside the loop,
exactly enough to give a nonvanishing graph (using [ d2d24(  )]|= = 1). there
2 for the two  propagators, and a 1 for the mixed
is also a symmetry factor of 1
graph because the two dierent types of internal propagator have opposite sign (and,
as usual, an overall 1 to get  from the t-matrix). thus, the supersymmetry (spin)
part of the algebra is almost trivial in this case.

exercise viiia5.1

use component methods to evaluate the rst graph with external fermions:
the contribution of the yukawa interaction to the fermion propagator. show
it agrees with the supergraph evaluation.

on the other hand, the internal group theory is slightly messy, so we treat the
general case immediately: we take vector multiplets v i for an arbitrary group (though
we will need a semisimple group for niteness, since abelian groups are not even

asymptotically free). sums pg are over each simple subgroup (or each abelian

factor), since they can have independent coupling constants grg for representation r
(especially gag for the adjoint, which we use for the pure super yang-mills term for
deniteness; except for the abelian factors, where a nontrivial representation should

be substituted). similarly, sumspr are over irreducible representations of the group;

j is the corresponding projection operator. for the simple (or single-component

where again a2 is the operator representing the one-loop propagator correction (t-
matrix) for self-interacting scalars. (of course, this operator may vary depending on
the internal masses; here we are concerned mostly with the divergences and leading
high-energy behavior, which is mass-independent. as usual, we can rescale the gauge
elds by their couplings in the lagrangian; this moves these couplings from the propa-
gators into the vertices, giving the same result for this term in  , since it has no v s.)
of course, this is the identical group theory that appears in the nonsupersymmetric
case; we have been more general here because we want to consider exact cancelation,
while in the nonsupersymmetric case simplicity is usually more important.

6. supergluon

the supergluon self-energy calculation is similar to the nonsupersymmetric cases
considered in subsections viiia2-3. examining the feynman rules, we see that those
for the vector multiplets are similar to the nonsupersymmetric ones for vectors (as
expected), while those for the scalar multiplets are similar to those for spinors: d2
and d2 are analogous to (in 22 matrix notation)  and *, etc.

494

viii. gauge loops

there are now only two kinds of loops to consider, vector and scalar multiplets:

as for the nonsupersymmetric case, ghosts in background-eld gauges couple the

same as matter, since at one loop the only coupling is to background elds and thus

covariant, even for ghosts. for the real scalar supereld describing the quantum

vector multiplet, looking at the terms in the action quadratic in v (from subsection

vib10)

s2v =z dx d4 1

4v ( + 2iw d + 2iw

. d .)v

we see that vertices have only 1 spinor derivative at most. however, we need at
least 4 spinor derivatives (2 ds and 2 ds) per loop (see subsection vic5), since the
result of reducing any loop to a point in  space always leaves the tadpole -integral
[d...d4(  )]|=, which vanishes for fewer than 4 derivatives. thus, a v loop in
a super yang-mills background vanishes for fewer than 4 external lines. this means

the entire contribution of quantum super yang-mills to the supergluon propagator

correction (or 3-point correction from real representations) in the background-eld

gauge comes from the 3 ghosts (including the nielsen-kallosh ghost), which couple
the same as 3 scalar multiplets in the adjoint representation. thus, for example,
we see without evaluating a single graph that this correction vanishes for n=4 super

yang-mills, which has also 3 physical adjoint scalar multiplets. (see subsection ivc7.)

for the scalar multiplets, we can nd the analog of the squared-propagator trick:

the easiest way is by the method of subsection iiic4, which automatically takes
care of factors of 1
2, and can be applied classically, without worrying about functional
determinants. this method requires we consider the massive theory at intermediate

stages of the calculation, although the mass can be dropped at the end. the only

resulting limitation is that we must restrict to real representations of the gauge group.

(in other words, the couplings must preserve parity: for these terms, cp invariance is

automatic, and reality means c invariance, so p invariance is implied.) however, this

is a restriction of the usefulness of the squared-propagator trick anyway: otherwise we
get expressions like (/ + ia/ )(/ ia/ *) which do not yield useful simplications. (they
require as much work as without the trick.) in such cases we are stuck with doing the

calculations the hard way. this is not just a technical diculty, it is a consequence

of the nal result being messier in such cases: for example, for real representations

there is no possibility of anomalies. however, we can separate the generators into

the real (scalar) and imaginary (pseudoscalar) ones: then this trick simplies the

real (polar vector) couplings but not the imaginary (axial vector) couplings. (as for

pauli-villars in subsection viiib2 below, but also for the physical elds before taking

a. propagators

495

the mass to vanish after the trick has been applied, the mass term can be chosen to
preserve the polar symmetries and thus violate the axial ones.)

however, by comparison of the propagator correction for complex and real rep-
resentations without (the supersymmetric version of) the squared-propagator trick,
we see that the only dierence between the two is in the (yang-mills) group theory.
thus, we can calculate for real representations rst, using the trick, and then for
complex representations by simply replacing the group-theory factor in the result for
the real ones.

repeating the procedure of subsection iiic4 with spinors replaced with chiral

superelds, we begin with the lagrangian (s =r dx l)

l = z d4  + m2(cid:18)z d2 1

22 +z d2  1

2

2(cid:19)

where the chiral superelds are covariantly chiral (or background-covariantly chiral)

 . =   = 0

treating  as auxiliary (the 2 term has no yang-mills coupling, as can be seen, e.g.,
in an antichiral representation), we eliminate it by its algebraic eld equation

 =

2
m 2

after a trivial rescaling

(and usingr d4 =r d2 

l = z d2 1

) we obtain the action

  21/4m
2 m2) = z d2 1

4 (  m2 + i[w ,])

( = aa) using an identity from subsection vic5.

in the chiral vacuum-bubble loop, we no longer have an explicit chiral supereld
= d2, we can

2 to + .... however, using the chiral representation 

2

2

to convert 
write the kinetic operator as

d22 = d2d2 + d2(2  d2)

to separate the truly free part from the background interactions. then quantization
can be preformed as usual (see subsection vic5): essentially, we can now use the
free  0 + m2 = p2 + m2 as kinetic operator, since at each vertex there is a d2 to
project back to chiral superelds. of course, in general we need only one projector in

496

viii. gauge loops

any trace over a subspace: in this case that result is obtained by integrating the d2s
by parts in the loop back and forth across the free propagators, since sandwiching
any 2  d2 between them produces

d2(2  d2) d2 = 1

2(  0 + i[w ,]) d2

repeating the procedure till only one d2 is left, the feynman rules for this loop become

propagator :

one vertex :

other vertices :

1

4(  )

1
2 (p2 + m2)
d2(2  d2)
2 (  0 + i[w ,])

1

we thus see that one vertex has at most 3 derivatives ( d2d) while the other has

at most 1 (d):

d2(2  d2) = d2[iad + 1
2 i(dw) 1

2aa]

2 i(da)  1
2[w , a] + iaaa + 1

1

2(  0 + i[w ,]) = iw d + 1
exactly the minimum needed. (thus, there are insucient derivatives for a tadpole
contribution to the propagator.) the result for this diagram is then the same as the
corresponding diagram in bosonic 3 theory, with a group theory factor tr(gigj),
and replacing (p)(p) with

2i(aaa) 1

2 w i(p, )aj

(p, )

using d = d, integration by parts, [ d2d24()]|= = 1, and w = d2a (chiral
representation). written in the notation of subsection viiia3, the 2-supergluon part
of the unrenormalized 1-loop eective action is then

1,2sg = h trz dx d2 1

2w ( 1

2 cr) a2w

for a scalar multiplet, and exactly 3 times that for a vector multiplet, including the
massive case. thus, cancelations again survive the introduction of masses. also, if
the masses of the various scalar multiplets are equal the entire propagator correction
is canceled in such theories, while for unequal masses only the divergence, and the
corresponding leading (logarithmic) high-energy term, is canceled.

exercise viiia6.1

show this result agrees with the restriction to n=1 supersymmetric theories
of the component result of subsection viiia3.

exercise viiia6.2

take the result of subsection viiia3 literally for all spins s (arbitrarily large).
using the fact that multiplets with n+1 supersymmetries can be written as
2 multiplets with n supersymmetries, diering in maximum helicity by 1/2,
recursively nd the result for general s (now labeling maximum helicity) for
all values of n 1, and show it vanishes for n 3.

exercise viiia6.3

calculate the chiral scalar contribution to the one-loop supergluon propagator
correction without the squared-propagator trick. (hint: there are 8 spinor
derivatives in the loop. integrating them by parts o one propagator produces
3 terms, since the number of ds and ds inside must be equal, because whats
left is always spacetime derivatives on [ d2d24(  )]|=.)

generalizing the group theory as in the previous subsection, we have the total

result

mg =xr

(for abelian factors, irrelevant for niteness, we should take the cag factor out of

niteness are

in particular, for the case of n=4 super yang-mills written in terms of n=1 superelds
(see subsection ivc7), we have 3 adjoint chiral scalars i with i = ii, where i is
the adjoint label and i = 1, 2, 3 (which appeared as the label i in subsection ivc7,
where the adjoint label was implicit in matrix notation). then

ijk = gaf ijki j k 

and the above two niteness conditions reduce to

i 
i  = 3,

j 
i  = 1

2i k lj k l

(j

i = fiklf jkl)

as explained in the previous subsection, in the general case the niteness conditions
may receive quantum corrections at 3 loops and beyond, depending on the model and
renormalization prescription, but no new conditions are added.

498

viii. gauge loops

presently there is no deep understanding for the niteness of these models (at

least, not deep enough to always avoid the quantum corrections to the niteness con-

ditions). note that they are nite for arbitrary values of the couplings, up to the
two above restrictions: for example, we can scale all the couplings by a common

factor. thus, they are nite order-by-order in perturbation theory (loops). non-

supersymmetric theories can also be nite, but only for specic numerical values of

the coupling, i.e., not for arbitrarily small values of the coupling, and thus not order-
by-order in the loop expansion; they therefore suer from the renormalon problem.

(the renormalon-like behavior of instantons is not a problem in the framework of the
1/nc expansion.) the niteness of theories with extended supersymmetry has been
explained by various arguments (in particular, for n=2 there are no divergences be-
yond 1 loop even for theories that are just renormalizable), but none of these applies

to the general case of simple supersymmetry.

to obtain more realistic models, we may want to consider adding soft super-

symmetry breaking terms (those which have little eect on high-energy behavior), as
introduced in subsection ivc6, to these nite theories. finiteness can be maintained,

but the conditions become considerably more complicated in the general case. note

that spontaneous breaking of supersymmetry is not allowed, because the rst condi-

tion prohibits u(1) factors (with cag = 0; thus nor d4 v terms), while the second
prohibits gauge-singlet matter (with crg = 0; thus nor d2  terms).

7. bosonization

a common method in eld theory is to consider simpler models where calculations

are easier, and see if they are analogous enough to give some insight. in particular,
two-dimensional models sometimes have perturbative features that are expected only

nonperturbatively in four dimensions: for example, we saw in subsection viib3

the generation of bound states at one loop in the 2d cp(n) model. of course,

some of the features may be misleadingly simple, and may have no analog in d=4.

two-dimensional theories, especially free, massless ones, are also useful to describe
the quantum mechanics of the worldsheet in string theory (see chapter xi). in this

subsection we consider free, massless 2d theories: essentially, this means just the

scalar and the spinor, since there are no transverse dimensions to give gauge elds

nontrivial components.

spinor notation is very simple in d=2, since the lorentz group is so(1,1)=gl(1).

for that purpose its convenient to use lightcone notation. 2d  matrices can be

a. propagators

chosen as

i(cid:1);

in general, even-d  matrices can be constructed as direct products of d/2 sets of
2d  matrices, so tr(i) = 2d/2. (for details, see subsection xc1.)

the lagrangian for a massless, complex spinor can be written this way as

l =  i/ = (i) + (i)

(this also follows from truncation of 4d spinor notation.) note that  and 
transform independently under proper lorentz transformations, as do their real and
imaginary parts. thus, we can not only impose a reality condition, but also a chirality
condition, dropping  or : a single real component is enough to not only dene
a spinor lorentz representation, but also construct an action.

in position space, the propagator for a massless scalar is (see exercise viib1.1)

1
 1

2

2(i)2(x  x) = ln[(x  x)2]

up to a real, dimensionful constant: we use units  = 1. the i for the  comes
from wick rotation back to minkowski space. the propagator for a massless spinor is
then ( = 2+, shortening the double s and s from spinor to lightcone
vector notation)

1
i

2(i)2(x  x) = i{ln[(x  x)2]} =

which has the unusual consequence (its wave equation)

with an appropriate -prescription implicit:

+ (t  t)

and that it satises the wave equation. (t  t can be replaced with (x  x)
in the above.)

500

viii. gauge loops

in d=2, the theory of a massless spinor eld is equivalent to that of a massless
scalar eld (bosonization). the explicit correspondence between the spinor and
scalar is shown by separating the scalar into its left-propagating and right-propagating
parts: this can be accomplished by dierentiating with respect to x and then inte-
grating back. we thus write

 = (+) + ()

where () is a function of only x and not x on-shell, and has propagator ln x.
the product of two fermion propagators, for (x)(x) and (x)(x), as would
follow from multiplying (x)(x) with (x)(x) in the functional integral (including
the 1 for the fermion loop, from reordering the s) is

(x  x)(cid:19)(cid:18) i
(cid:18) i

(x  x)(cid:19) = 

{ln[(x  x)2]}

this shows that () has the same propagator as , with  = (,) not
summed, so we can equate

() = 

which gives an explicit expression for the scalar in terms of the spinor after integration
over x.

the inverse relation is (quantum mechanically, not classically)

 = ei()

which can be checked by a sum of multiloop diagrams: the equivalent of connecting
(x) to (x) by a single propagator is to expand ei()(x) and ei()(x) each to nth
order and connect x and x with n () propagators, and sum over n (with appropriate
combinatoric factors). the () propagators are
ln[i(x  x)]

with the i determined by wick rotation. the propagator of the composite fermions
is then:

xn=0

1

n!{ln[i(x  x)]}n =

i

(x  x)

a. propagators

501

although this gives the appearance of a scalar being the bound state of spinors,
and vice versa, even in the free theory, there is a simpler interpretation, even clas-
sically: massless particles in d=2 travel at the speed of light in one of two possible
directions. thus, a collection of free left-(or right-)handed massless particles travels
along together, not separating, and thus acting like a bound state. (as shown in sub-
section vc8, singularities in perturbative quantum eld theory directly correspond
to congurations in classical mechanics.)

bosonization extends to massive fermions: the massive thirring model
l = (i) + (i) + m2

(  + ) + g 



is equivalent to the sine-gordon model

l = 1

22(1  cos )]

2 [ 1

4 ()2 + 1

with the above relation between the spinor and scalar elds, and

1
2 = 1 + 2g,

2
2  m

(note in particular the free massive fermion for  = 1.) in this case the bound states
are dynamical. note that the relation is between strong coupling in one theory and
weak in the other (duality).

8. schwinger model

the simplest interacting model in d=2 is the schwinger model, massless qed.
this theory is even simpler than scalar theories because its interactions occur only
through a massless gauge vector, which has no physical polarizations in two dimen-
sions (d2=0).

the most interesting feature of the schwinger model is that all amplitudes with
external vectors can be calculated exactly. in fact, the only nonvanishing 1pi vector
amplitude is the one-loop propagator correction, which gives just a mass term. in
that sense the theory is trivial, and describes just a massive vector. however, the
methods of calculation are instructive. we rst consider some simple methods of
calculation of just the propagator correction, and then show that it is the only 1pi
vector graph. one method we have already considered is dimensional regularization;
from subsection viiia2-3 we have the contribution to the eective action (correcting
for the 2d normalization tr(i) = 2)

1 =z dx f

viii. gauge loops

where we write fab = abf in d=2. although this calculation needs no renormal-
ization, regularization is still necessary to allow naive manipulation of the integrand:
using dimensional regularization, we see from the result of subsection viiia3 that
d1  4s2   in d = 2 + 2, canceling the 1/ pole from the scalar
we get a factor of
integral.

it can also be calculated in position space, using the methods of the previous

subsection. the lagrangian in lightcone notation is

l =  1

4e2 f 2 + [ (i + a) + (i + a)]

f = a  a

we can calculate separately the contributions of  and  to fermion loops. the
photon propagator correction consists of the product of two fermion propagators,
as given in the previous subsection. we then nd for the eective action (including
another 1 for t   and a 1
2 for identical external lines), after including a nite
counterterm to restore gauge invariance,

this same calculation also gives the axial anomaly: consider an axial vector

the anomaly is the breaking of b gauge invariance,

an anomaly is by denition a quantum eect: as we have seen from the 2d
axial anomaly, it is related to a divergence that violates naive classical arguments,
since the regulator itself violates the symmetry. in the axial case there is no actual
divergent term in the eective action, but a nite term results from a / type of
cancelation. dimensional analysis immediately reveals that the propagator correction
is the only graph in d=2 that can contribute such a term from the fermion loop.

(fermion propagators go as 1/p, while the vertex is a constant: the electric charge
has dimension in d6=4.)

the complete one-loop eective action for the vectors then follows directly from
the complete anomaly for the axial current, and the vanishing of the anomaly for the
polar current: by separating out the anomalous term in the eective action,

but also the divergence of the axial current. (there are some questions of boundary
conditions in solving the divergence- and curl-free conditions as j = 0, but these
are resolved by working in euclidean momentum space.)

similar remarks apply to external gravity: from a similar calculation, replacing

the vector current with the energy-momentum tensor, we nd

where r is the 2d curvature (which is just a scalar, as the vector eld strength is

chosen to preserve local conservation of energy-momentum and thus violate conformal
invariance t m
m = 0. (the above expressions are linearized, but the results can be
generalized to fully nonlinear gravity.)

the above action is dual to the mass term of the stuckelberg action:

a consider the rst-order lagrangian

l = g2 + ga(maa + a)

eliminating the auxiliary eld ga by its eld equation yields the usual mass
term for the stuckelberg model. show that if we vary  instead and solve
the resulting constraint on g, we obtain (the nongravitational part of) the
previous action.

in general, the only loop corrections that can be evaluated exactly in terms of el-

ementary functions are the one-loop propagator corrections. however, limiting forms

of vertex corrections, for various low- or high-energy limits, explicitly yield the most

important pieces for certain applications.

1. jwkb

some low-energy contributions to the eective action can be obtained by vari-

ous quantum mechanical jwkb approximations. this involves an expansion of the

external eld about its vacuum value in spacetime derivatives (momenta). such an

expansion makes sense if this eld is massless, since then small spatial momentum

means also small energy, in the relativistic sense. (otherwise one needs to expand

nonrelativistically, about ~p = 0 but e = m. such treatments were considered in sub-

section iib5, and will be applied to loops in subsection viiib6.) it also can be useful

when the mass of the external eld is small compared to the mass scale relevant to

the interactions, such as for chiral symmetry breaking in the low-energy description

of light mesons (subsection iva4).

on the other hand, the elds we are integrating out must be massive, with a mass

greater than the energy we want to investigate: otherwise, the internal particles

would show up as poles (and cuts) in the amplitudes, where taylor expansion in

momenta would be a poor approximation. the basic principle for analyzing the

behavior of such a theory in a certain energy range is thus to rst nd contributions

to the eective action where: (1) only particles with masses of lower energy appear

on external (background) lines, and (2) only particles with masses of higher energy

appear on internal (quantum) lines. these contributions are approximated by taylor

expansion to nite order in external momenta, yielding a local eective action. we

could then consider nishing the functional integration by integrating out the lighter

particles on internal lines: however, in this approximation it would be inaccurate to

consider such particles in loops, since there they would include energies above the

approximation scale. thus, the eective action obtained by integrating out just the

heavier elds is useful only when the lighter elds are treated classically. we apply

the same approximation scheme to the classical action: eliminate the heavier elds by

their classical equations of motion, and taylor expand their propagators in momenta

to the desired order to get a local result.

508

viii. gauge loops

in subsection viib2 we saw the simplest example, the eective potential: in that
case the constant background scalar eld acted as just a correction to the mass. we
now consider more complicated cases, where spin and gauge invariance play roles for
the internal or external elds. in particular, adding coordinate dependence to the
background elds means we need to consider more general propagators for quadratic
kinetic operators, such as harmonic oscillators.

we saw in subsection vib1 the most general relativistic particle action for a scalar
.
in external elds that was quadratic in x and
x. we now consider such actions in more
detail: they are the most general ones for which we can derive one-loop results to all
orders in the external elds (i.e., without performing the jwkb expansion beyond the
rst quantum correction, which requires taylor expanding the exponential in terms
that are beyond quadratic, thus expanding in the number of external elds).

.
x: terms linear in

without loss of generality, we can consider lagrangians that are homogeneous
.
of second order in x and
x are boundary (in  ) terms, and were
already eliminated by a gauge transformation (radial gauge). terms linear in x can
be removed by a translation, in the presence of an x2 term (which is needed to bound
an x term in the potential). (both these kinds of terms can be restored trivially at
the end.) a constant term is also trivial, giving a contribution to the classical action
0 d ), and can be treated separately. (it
doesnt contribute to the equations of motion.) the remaining contribution to the
mechanics action is then of the form (as usual, in the gauge v = 1)

that is just that times t (after integrationr t

where a is an antisymmetric matrix and b symmetric. the steps to this contribution
to the one-loop eective eld action are then:

(1) solve the equations of motion, which are homogeneous second-order dierential

equations.

(2) change variables from the two parameters used for each x to x(0) and x(t ).
(second-order dierential equations require two initial conditions, or one initial
and one nal.)

(3) find s(x(0), x(t )), including separately the contribution from the constant term

in the lagrangian.

(4) find the propagator for time t , including the eis and the van vleck determi-

nant. (see exercise va2.4.)

b. low energy

509

(5) integrate the propagator over t to nd  . (see subsection viib2.)

for example, consider in qed the contribution to  from a fermion loop. if we
are interested in only the properties of photons, then this gives the entire contribu-
tion to the functional integral from integrating out the fermions: this contribution,
plus the classical (free) maxwell action, gives a nonlocal classical action of self-
interacting photons, which can itself be quantized to give the exact qed result for
external photons. although this one-loop eective action is too dicult to calculate
exactly, the rst-quantized jwkb approximation can give an accurate description
at energies small compared to the electron mass. note that we are simultaneously
approximating to the rst quantum correction in jwkb expansions of both the eld
(second-quantized) type (one-loop) and the mechanics (rst-quantized) type.

the mechanics action for a massive particle in a constant external electromagnetic
eld strength (the lowest nontrivial order, but also the highest that keeps the action
quadratic), in the radial gauge for the background eld and ane parametrization of
the worldline, is (see subsection vib1)

to include spin, we identify (see subsection viiia3)

since the only appearance of spin operators in the calculation of the propagator

it as a number till the last step. the equation of motion

2. axial anomaly

the axial anomaly comes from a nite graph, as we have already seen in subsection
viiia8 for the case d=2. however, the naive manipulations that would show the
graph to preserve gauge invariance involve evaluating the nite dierence between
divergent graphs, each of which needs regularization. although in some cases the
graph can be evaluated explicitly, and then shown to be anomalous, it is generally
easier, and more instructive, to analyze the anomaly by itself.

the axial anomaly is associated with the use of  tensors.

in renormalizable
theories in d=4, these occur only through 1s for spinors. (in nonrenormalizable
theories, or in d=2,  tensors can occur in scalar theories. there is also the term

b. low energy

511

abcdfabfcd, which is a total divergence, and has no eect in perturbation theory.)
in general even dimensions, the massless kinetic term for a spinor is invariant under
transformations generated by 1, but the mass term is not. chiral symmetry is thus
related to masslessness; this is also true for conformal invariance, so its not surpris-
ing that quantum corrections can break both. (in fact, in supersymmetric theories
conformal symmetry is related to a particular chiral symmetry by supersymmetry, so
breaking of one requires breaking of the other if supersymmetry is to be preserved.)

dimensional regularization manifestly preserves neither conformal nor chiral in-
variance; no regularization does. the existence of these anomalies proves the impos-
sibility of such a regularization. furthermore, dimensional reduction has diculty
dealing with 1; it even has inconsistencies in the presence of axial anomalies. on
the other hand, pauli-villars regularization is especially convenient for dealing with
axial anomalies because it regularizes by introducing masses. thus, it breaks chiral
symmetry explicitly but softly, conveniently parametrizing the breaking by mass pa-
rameters. we therefore will use pauli-villars regularization for the single purpose of
evaluating the axial anomaly.

the basic idea of pauli-villars regularization is to include massive ghost elds
which would cancel graphs from physical elds if they had the same mass. but the
masses of the ghosts are used as regulators; after subtracting local divergences, the
regulator mass is taken to innity. in our case, as well see by explicit evaluation, the
anomaly itself is nite, so no subtraction is necessary.

the graph whose anomaly we want to evaluate is a one-loop 1pi graph with
external vectors and a massless internal spinor. of the vectors, all but one is a
polar vector, coupling to a, while the last is an axial vector, coupling to
1a. these are the currents associated with the symmetries  = ei and
 = e1 (2
2 ). we add to this graph a similar one, but with a massive
spinor, and give the second graph an overall relative minus sign. since the mass
breaks chiral invariance, we have explicitly broken the gauge invariance of the axial
vector, while preserving those of the polar vectors. note that this is a feature of the
regularization: if a regularization existed that preserved chiral symmetry, then we
could freely move the 1 around the graph from one vertex to the next using the

1 =  1

512

viii. gauge loops

usual naive anticommutation relations, thus moving also the anomaly from one vertex
to the next (i.e., violating gauge invariance in any vector we choose).

gauge invariance is represented by vanishing divergence of the corresponding

current: at each vertex we have the couplingr a j, with gauge invariance a = ,

implying j = 0 by integration by parts, where j may be polar or axial depending on
the vertex. these currents are conserved classically. we know they are also conserved
quantum mechanically in the absence of 1s, since dimensional regularization and
renormalization preserve the gauge invariance of the eective action.
in graphical
terms, taking the divergence at a vertex kills a propagator (since   j is proportional
to the eld equations of the internal eld), and this can be shown to lead to vanishing
of the graph.

however, with the pauli-villars regulator, the classical conservation of the axial
current is explicitly broken. the result is that the complete axial anomaly can be
found by looking at just the contribution coming from this explicit classical violation
of current conservation (inserted into the one-loop graph). (the classically vanish-
ing contributions are actually nonvanishing because of the anomaly, but they cancel
between the physical and regulator elds, precisely because the regularization allows
the naive manipulations that justify dropping them.)

we therefore want to evaluate the anomaly

aj a(x)  a



aa(x)

where we start with a term in the classical actionr a  j, so classically j = s/a,

and then evaluate its quantum correction by looking at j  /a in terms of the
one-loop part of the eective action  . classically, we nd a contribution from only
the regulator,

  j    (

2i 1) = 2m 1

so, all we need to evaluate is a one-loop diagram with the axial vector coupling to the

regulator replaced with a pseudoscalar coupling r  1, and look at the graphs

with one external pseudoscalar and the rest polar vectors. clearly this is the same
as coupling the pseudoscalar to the propagator of a bosonic spinor regulator in an
external vector eld:

  j = 2m tr 1

b. low energy

513

where the trace is in the -matrix space. in the limit m  , graphs with more
external lines vanish more rapidly. on the other hand, we need at least d/2 fac-
tors of sab (d -matrices) to give a nonvanishing -matrix trace. thus, the leading
contribution will be, using 2/ 2 = + isabfab from subsection iiic4,

  j = 2m2 tr(cid:20)1

with d/2+1 propagators, where

0 = (a)2.

thus, the only feynman diagram we actually need to evaluate is the one-loop 1pi
diagram with external and internal scalars. the limit internal m   is the same
as the limit external p  0. (the result does not depend on the internal momentum,
which is integrated over, nor the external mass, which would appear only in external
propagators.) thus, this is just an eective potential calculation. we therefore have
the integral (see subsection viib1)

check this result by using the expression from subsection viiib1 for the

3. anomaly cancelation

when the anomaly occurs in a current that couples to a gauge eld, unitarity
is destroyed, since gauge invariance implies current conservation. this is a poten-
tial problem, since axial vector couplings occur in the standard model. (actually,
they are va: (vector)(axial vector).) the only way to avoid this problem is
to have an anomaly cancelation between the dierent spinors: the coecient of the
anomaly is given purely by group theory, as tr(a{b, c}), where a, b, c are the
matrices representing the couplings of the three vectors to all spinors, and the anti-
commutator comes from bose symmetrization (from the crossed and uncrossed graph
in the s-matrix, or the single contribution multiplying commuting elds in the ef-
fective action). we therefore require this trace (which represents the sum over all
spinors) to vanish. (see exercises ib5.3 and vc9.2d for an example of the calculation
of this trace.) the representations in the standard model have been chosen so this
cancelation occurs in each family.

we already know in terms of dirac notation that axial anomalies appear only
in the presence of 1s. an absence of 1s is equivalent in terms of weyl no-
tation to the use of a (pseudo)real representation for undotted weyl spinors. for
example, consider a real representation that is reducible to a smaller (by half) rep-
resentation r and its complex conjugate  r: then we can complex conjugate
the complex-conjugate representation to produce a dotted weyl spinor that is the
same representation as the undotted spinor. the undotted and dotted spinor can
then be combined, as usual, to form a dirac spinor, which transforms as the complex
representation, without 1s, and thus the same goes for the coupling of the gauge
vector:

r   r  r  r

.  r

so, in dirac notation we can see that such representations do not contribute to anoma-
lies because of the absence of 1s. similar remarks apply to general real or pseudo-
real representations: we can take an arbitrary (pseudo)real representation and make
a majorana spinor, as

r  r  r

.  r

where now r

. is simply the complex conjugate of r since r = r.

this cancelation also can be seen directly in terms of weyl spinors: the (pseudo)-
reality of the representation is charge conjugation invariance (which is equivalent to
parity invariance for spin-1 couplings to spinors, since such couplings are always cp
invariant). anomaly cancelation is then a generalization of furrys theorem (see

b. low energy

515

subsection viia5). real and pseudoreal representations of the generators (including
complex + complex conjugate) are antisymmetric, up to a unitary transformation,
since they are hermitian:

gt = g* = ugu1
(so  = ig preserves reality or pseudoreality). thus

tr(a{b, c}) = tr(at{bt ,c t}) = tr(a{b, c})  tr(a{b, c}) = 0

in particular, any mass term (without higgs) t  requires a real representation (so
its variation yields g + gt = 0); a pseudoreal representation wont work because it
uses an antisymmetric metric which, when combined with c, makes t  vanish
by symmetry (since  is anticommuting). a related way to see in weyl (or dirac)
notation that real representations are nonanomalous is to use the same squared-
propagator trick we used for the propagator correction in subsection viiia3 (or re-
lated complex action from subsection iiic4), which resulted in simplied feynman
rules only for real representations: with those rules, there are no potentially diver-
gent 3-point graphs other than those that already occur for scalars (as part of the
covariantization of the propagator divergence).

the absence of 1s is a special case of parity invariance. however, even par-
ity invariance is not enough to enforce cancelation of anomalies, since some parity
invariant theories have axial gauge vectors, which couple to axial currents  1a ,
and the appearance of these 1s can be sucient to introduce anomalies. in these
anomalous cases, even if there is a c, the charge conjugation argument above does
not apply because the c following from the usual cp and the obvious p does not
simply replace a  at , but is some other permutation of similar representations.
thus, in general p (and c) invariance is unrelated to anomaly cancelation: we can
have one without the other. having real representations (i.e., no 1s) is a special
case of both.

exercise viiib3.1

consider chiral symmetry (as in subsection iva4 or ivb1) for a single avor
 u(1)lu(1)r. now gauge that symmetry:

a in weyl spinor notation, write the action for massless weyl spinors l, r
each coupled to their own gauge vector. clearly there is one anomaly for 3
external alas, due to l, and another for ara, due to r, and no mixing.
now assume the left and right coupling constants are equal (so the anomalies
are equal). write the resulting symmetry transformations on all elds under
cp, c, and p.

b rewrite this theory in dirac notation. using p, nd the combinations of al
and ar that are (polar) vector and axial vector. relate the anomaly cal-
culations in the two notations. show that dropping the axial vector gives
(massless) qed. find the theory that results from dropping the vector in-
stead: give the gauge symmetry, and show it is anomalous, and explain the
anomaly (vs. the cancelation of the anomaly in qed) in both weyl and dirac
language.

c generalize all the above results to u(n)lu(n)r.

(note that c will now
include complex conjugation on the hermitian matrices for the vectors, so
that p wont.)

the simplest way to prove anomalies cancel in the standard model is to use our
previous results for guts (subsection ivb4): (1) one way is to consider the gut
gauge group su(4)su(2)su(2). first, we note that tr(gi) = 0 because the group
is semisimple, so there are no mixed anomalies. then we see that the su(4) couplings
are the usual color-type couplings, without 1s (i.e., 44), so it has no anomalies.
on the other hand, su(2) has only (pseudo)real representations, so neither su(2)
has anomalies. thus, anomalies cancel in the su(4)su(2)su(2) gut. finally,
breaking to su(3)su(2)u(1) (which also spontaneously breaks parity) leaves an
extra singlet per family, which decouples, showing the cancelation for the standard
model.

(2) another way is to start with so(10), which is anomaly free for any represen-

tation of fermions:

tr(gab,{gcd, gef}) = 0

simply because there is no combination of kronecker s with the appropriate sym-
metry (and similarly for so(n), except for n=2 or 6, where such a term can be
produced with the  tensor). breaking to the standard model again drops just a
singlet (as does breaking to su(5), showing its anomaly cancelation; breaking to
su(4)su(2)su(2) drops nothing, again showing its cancelation). in general, prov-
ing anomaly cancelation requires (a) using such arguments about real representations,
or (b) the absence of anomalies for certain groups (namely, only su(n) for n>2, or
u(1), can have anomalies), or (c) explicitly calculating the relevant traces.

4. 0  2

when an anomalous axial symmetry appears only as a global symmetry classi-
cally, unitarity is preserved, since no gauge eld couples to that current. this can be

b. low energy

517

a useful way to explain approximate global symmetries. the fact that the anomaly
is always a total derivative (because of the  tensor and the bianchi identity for f )
means that the global symmetry is not broken perturbatively. (however, when the
external vectors are nonabelian, there can be contributions from eld congurations
like instantons: see subsection iiic6.) in subsection iva4, we saw that the neutral
pion (0), the lightest hadron, could be considered as the pseudogoldstone boson of
an axial u(1) symmetry. we also want to consider the pion as a bound state of a
quark and antiquark: if we knew the wave function, we could write the coupling,
and calculate directly the decay of the neutral pion into two photons (0  2) via
quark-antiquark annihilation, or at least nd the leading low-quark-energy contribu-
tion from the -function part of the wave function (in the relative coordinates of the
quark and antiquark), corresponding to the coupling to 1. (an expansion of
the wave function in derivatives of the  function would give coupling to currents
containing derivatives.)

lacking such detailed information, the best we can do is extend the nonlinear 
model approach, which is to look for the terms in the phenomenological lagrangian
(expressed in terms of composite meson elds, not fundamental quark elds) with
fewest derivatives (i.e., those most important at low energy), applying the condition
of (approximate) chiral symmetry. specically, the global axial symmetry  = 2,
where a = a for the photon eld, along with the electromagnetic gauge invariance
for a, under which the neutral pion eld is invariant, would suggest couplings of pion
to photon involving only  and f .

however, the anomaly allows the existence of another term: since by denition
(from considering coupling to an unphysical axial gauge eld) the anomaly is given
from a local axial transformation, while the pion eld transforms in a trivial way
under this transformation, we can attribute the anomaly to the pion coupling as

using the abelian form of the chern-simons form (subsection iiic6), we also can

(in the nonabelian case, we can neglect the surface term only if the vacuum value of
 has already been subtracted.) adding this term to those found previously (the 
and a kinetic terms, as well as the quark terms that dene the normalization of the
 eld through its coupling), the decay rate for 0  2 can be calculated (including
the 2 relevant avors of quarks, and 3 colors, using the values of their electromagnetic
charges), and is found to agree closely with the experimental value.

exercise viiib4.1

what is 0 in d=2? what is the interpretation of the pion eld in terms of
the elds of the schwinger model (subsection viiia8)?

the global anomaly in the nonperturbative case can be applied to the strong
interactions (qcd), although not as straightforwardly: considering the external vec-
tors to be gluons (so there is an implicit trace above over the group indices), 0 gives
a coupling of a neutral meson to a pseudoscalar glueball, as discussed in subsection
ic4. if the vacuum gives a nontrivial value to tr(abcdfabfcd) (as for instantons), this
also leads to anomalous cp violation in the strong interactions.

one-loop triangle graphs cant be evaluated in terms of elementary functions.
however, in qed the most important eects are at low energy. we therefore will
evaluate the eective action in the quantum mechanical version of the jwkb ex-
pansion, as an expansion in derivatives. the resulting approximation to the eective
action thus will be local, but include terms of higher dimension than the classical
action, whose coecients are therefore nite and unrenormalized: by dimensional
analysis, this means their coecients will have powers of the inverse electron mass,
which can be considered as the expansion parameter. (see also subsection viib7,
where a scalar 1-loop vertex divergence was evaluated.)

6. nonrelativistic jwkb

as for other processes, the application of quantum eld theory to bound states has
two steps: (1) calculate the (gauge-invariant) eective action; (2) nd solutions to
the eld equations following from the eective action (on-shell states). for bound
states such solutions are nonperturbative; however, their determination is easier for
nonrelativistic systems, since we can ignore production and annihilation of additional
nonrelativistic (massive) particles in the second step because their eect already has
been included as small corrections to the eective action.

the lamb shift is the (eld theoretic) quantum contribution to the energy levels
of the hydrogen atom, which is described accurately even at one loop. the relativistic
solution is found by perturbing the relativistic eective action in derivatives about
the nonrelativistic one, whose solutions are the usual exact ones of the nonrelativistic

522

viii. gauge loops

schrodinger equation. for atoms the electron speed p/m is of the order of  (= 2e2),
so the loop and derivative expansions are in the same small parameter.

the eective action is more conveniently calculated with manifestly relativistic
methods, since the internal (virtual) particles can be relativistic (especially those
that contribute to the uv divergences). on the other hand, the solutions to the eld
equations are more conveniently calculated in a representation that takes better ad-
vantage of the nonrelativistic expansion, since the external particles are nonrelativis-
tic. therefore, the second step begins by performing a eld redenition that converts
the manifestly lorentz invariant eective action to a form recognizable as nonrel-
ativistic eld theory with low-energy relativistic and loop corrections.
(originally
the lamb shift was calculated without this transformation. higher-order calculations
then required use of the relativistic bethe-salpeter equation, which made collection
of terms of a given order more dicult.) in subsection iib5 we considered the gen-
eralized foldy-wouthuysen transformation and its application to minimal coupling;
we now apply it to the nonminimal coupling introduced by loop corrections. (in the
literature this step has been performed on the feynman diagrams themselves; how-
ever, as usual we can save some eort by working directly with the eective action.)
here the nonminimal correction to the transformation is easy, since the nonminimal
terms are already near the order to which we work.

we rst perform some dimensional analysis, using the fact that the leading be-
havior is given by the usual nonrelativistic schrodinger equation. then the only
parameters in units h = 1 (but there is no c in the nonrelativistic theory with just
coulomb interaction) are the mass m and speed e2, so (in the notation of subsection
iib5)

i  me2,

0  me4

(neglecting the rest mass contribution). it is then convenient to reorganize the ex-
pansion in 1/m to relate to the expansion in e2: for example, we can identify the two
by choice of units

along with c = 1 (since we will include relativistic corrections).

the relativistic form of the schrodinger equation is obtained by multiplying 20
in front of the kinetic operator of the electron in a background electromagnetic eld,
as obtained from the eective action. approximating the proton as innitely massive
(for which we can partially correct by using the reduced mass for the electron), we
take the electric eld as described by the usual static scalar potential, and drop the
magnetic eld along with the vector potential.

b. low energy

523

we therefore modify the expansion of subsection iib5 by

(1) reorganizing the 1/m expansion according to our dimensional analysis,

(2) using only a static electric background, and

(3) working directly in terms of  matrices: we can either plug in the dirac case of
the spin operators into the expressions of subsection iib5, including the reality-
restoring transformation of subsection iib4,

or just expand the dirac operator directly,

the sign of the one-loop correction to the gauge coupling is opposite in qcd to
that of qed: the photon coupling is weak at low energies (actually, any observable
energy, since the coupling runs so slowly), while the gluon coupling is weak at high
energies (with respect to the hadronic mass scale). thus, typically perturbation in
loops is used to study high-energy behavior of qcd, while the low-energy behavior
awaits the discovery of a general nonperturbative approach.

1. conformal anomaly

symmetries of the classical action that are violated at the quantum level are called
anomalous. there are two major sources for such anomalies in renormalizable
quantum eld theory: (1) there are anomalies associated with the totally antisym-
metric matrix a1...ad, called axial (see subsections viiia8 and viiib2-4). when
they occur, they are found in graphs with at least (d+2)/2 external lines. they are
associated with graphs that have no divergences, yet require regularization. (2) the
existence of divergences requires the introduction of a mass scale even in theories
that are classically conformal. if anywhere, these show up at least in the most diver-
gent graphs, the propagator corrections. normally, both kinds of anomalies will rst
appear at one loop.

when anomalies are associated with global symmetries, they provide a natural
way to explain approximate symmetries, in the sense of the perturbative approx-
imation. however, when they occur in local symmetries, they destroy the gauge
invariance needed to prove unitarity. the latter type of theory therefore must be
avoided by applying the condition of anomaly cancelation in local symmetries.

we have already seen the appearance of the conformal anomaly in our renormal-
ization of divergent loop graphs: the introduction of a renormalization mass scale
breaks the scale invariance of a classically scale-invariant theory. the simplest ex-
ample, and generally the most important, is the one-loop propagator correction. if
we examine only high-energy behavior, then we can neglect masses from the classical
action.

using dimensional regularization, the generic eect on the eective action of the
complete one-loop propagator correction is to modify the kinetic term of an arbitrary
massless theory to

classical kinetic operator,  is the renormalization mass scale, and 1 is a constant
determined by the one-loop calculation. as long as 1 is nonvanishing (i.e., the theory
is not nite) we can rewrite this as

where

is a renormalization-independent mass scale: any physical measurement will observe
g and  in only this combination. a choice of dierent renormalization mass scale
is equivalent to a nite renormalization of g2, such that m is unchanged.
in the
case where g is dimensionless (the relevant one, since we are studying the conformal
anomaly), the coupling constant has undergone dimensional transmutation, being
replaced with a dimensionful constant.

exercise viiic1.1

show this is the case for massless (scalar) 3 theory in d=6 from the explicit
one-loop correction.

if there is more than one coupling constant, things are more complicated, but
the same phenomenon occurs: one dimensionless coupling is replaced with a mass.
a particularly interesting case is pure yang-mills theory: then we can write an
important contribution to the eective action as

f 1 ln

m 2 f

where f is now the complete nonabelian eld strength, and
is the square of the
covariant derivative. since this contribution by itself gives the complete 1-loop con-
formal anomaly, the rest of the 1-loop eective action is conformally invariant. (all
its m dependence cancels.)

note that the (one-loop) anomaly itself is local: if we perform an innitesimal
conformal transformation on the one-loop part of the eective action, this variation
gives a local quantity. this is clear from the way this anomaly arose in dimensional
regularization: if there were no innities, there would be no anomaly, since the naive
conformal invariance of the classical theory would be preserved at each step. however,
to regularize the divergence we needed to continue the theory to arbitrary dimensions,
and the theory is not conformal away from 4 dimensions. the scale variation of a
4d conformal action in 4-2 dimensions is proportional to  times that action, as

528

viii. gauge loops

follows from dimensional analysis; this scaling can be associated with the nonvanishing
(engineering) dimension of the coupling away from d=4.
(usually, we write the
coupling as g, where g is dimensionless. the elds have engineering dimension
independent of d, dened by the value in d=4: e.g., in  =  + a, a has the same
dimension as .) however, the one-loop eective action is coupling independent;
thus, when dimensionally regularized but unrenormalized, its scale invariant. for
example, in the propagator correction discussed above, we get a regularized term
 1
 1k( 1
), which is scale invariant but divergent. on the other hand, the
counterterm added to make it nite is from the 4d conformal action, and thus is not
scale invariant in d6=4; so the breaking of scale invariance can be associated entirely
with the counterterm.
(i.e., the anomaly coming from the renormalized, nonlocal
eective action is equal to that coming from the innite, local counterterm.) since
the counterterm is local, the anomaly is local. its also nite, since its proportional
to  (from the variation) times 1/ (from the divergent coecient of the counterterm).
in our propagator example, we have

 1k( 1

a similar situation occurs for the axial anomaly with pauli-villars regularization:
after regularization, the anomaly comes entirely from the regulator graph, which is
not only nite by power counting, but local in the innite-mass limit because that is
the zero-momentum (eective potential or jwkb) limit.

there is a physical signicance to the sign of the constant 1. (we saw some
evidence of this already in our analysis of renormalons in section viic.) instead of
thinking in terms of the renormalization-independent mass scale m, we can treat g
as an eective energy-dependent (running) coupling,

in the case 1 > 0 the coupling gets weaker at high energy (asymptotic freedom),
while for 1 < 0 the coupling gets stronger at high energy (until it reaches the lan-
dau ghost). (for low energy the situation is generally more subtle, since we usually
have complications from physical masses.) for qcd, this weakening of the cou-
pling at high energy allows the separation of an amplitude into a nonperturbative
low-energy piece (describing the observed particles, the bound-state hadrons), which
is determined experimentally, and a perturbative high-energy piece (describing the
non-asymptotic, fundamental partons, gluons and quarks), which can be calculated.
(this sometimes goes under the somewhat misleading name of perturbative qcd.)

c. high energy

529

this strongly contrasts with qed, where the weakening of the coupling at low en-
ergy means both fundamental particles (photons, electrons, etc.) and bound states
(positronium, atoms, etc.) can be treated perturbatively, and the only experimentally
determined quantities are the values of masses and the electron charge (coupling at
low-energy). thus, in qed one in principle can calculate anything, while in qcd
one is restricted to parts of certain amplitudes. (various nonperturbative methods
also have been developed for qcd, but so far they have successfully calculated only a
few low-energy constants, as used in  models, i.e., masses and low-energy couplings.)
although experimental verication of these results is sucient to conrm the qcd
description of hadrons, a practical description of hadronic cross sections at all ener-
gies would seem to require a string model that can incorporate behavior attributed
to both strings and partons.

2. e e  hadrons

if quarks and gluons are conned, how can qcd be useful? qed is useful be-
cause the coupling is small: e2  1/861 is the perturbation parameter in relativistic
(quantum eld theory, or 4d) calculations,  = 2e2  1/137 in nonrelativistic
(quantum mechanics, or 3d). energy levels of the hydrogen atom can be calculated
quite accurately, without the question of freely existing electrons and protons coming
up. the speed of the bound electron is also , another way to understand why pair
creation/annihilation and other relativistic or multiparticle eects are small, and can
be treated perturbatively.

therefore, the real usefulness of a eld theory depends not on how physical the
choice of elds is, but how accurate the perturbation expansion is. nonperturba-
tive results may give some nice qualitative features, but they are ultimately useless
unless they can be used as the basis of a new perturbation expansion. (attempts
at nonperturbative approaches to 4d quantum eld theory continue, but so far the
results are meager compared to perturbative results, or to nonperturbative results in
quantum mechanics or 2d quantum eld theory.)

the simplest application of qcd is to the production of hadrons by a photon
created by the annihilation of an electron and a positron. the total cross section for
such an event is given (according to the optical theorem) by the imaginary part of
quark contributions to the photon propagator: since hadrons are made up of partons
(quarks and gluons), we assume a sum over hadrons can be written as a sum over
partons. this assumption, that hadrons can be described by a resummation of the
perturbation expansion, should be good at least at high energies, where the partons

530

viii. gauge loops

asymptotic freedom takes eect (and perhaps at lower energies by an appropriate
extrapolation). to lowest order for the process under consideration this is a 1-loop
graph, with a quark in the loop. if we compare this to the production of, e.g., muon-
antimuon pairs (but not back to electron-positron pairs, because that includes the
crossed diagram) by the same procedure, and we neglect masses (at high enough
energies), then the only dierence should be in the group theory: hadron production
should be greater by a factor of the number of colors times the sum over avors of
the square of the quarks electric charge:

r 

p (e+e  h)

p (e+e  +)  ncxf

q2
f

experimentally this relation is conrmed for nc = 3, if the only avors included in
the sum are those with masses below the photon energy ((2mf )2 < s).

this result can be extended to the case where the momenta of hadrons are ob-
served (not summed over): although individual partons are not observed as asymp-
totic states, the dominant contribution to the cross section at high energies is given
by the conversion of the quarks into hadrons by the creation from the vacuum of
parton pairs with energies, and angular deviation from the partons created by the
photon, smaller than experimental accuracy. we treat all partons as approximately
massless, with respect to the energy scale of the photon. thus, each parton created
by the photon starts out initially as free, is then accompanied by parallel partons of
small energy to form hadrons, and then these hadrons may further decay, but with a
small angular spread with respect to the directions of each of the initial partons. such
collections of nal-state hadrons are called jets. for high-energy electron-positron
annihilation, the dominant hadronic decay mode of this o-shell photon is thus into
two jets. this experimental result is further verication of qcd, and in particular a
jet is the most direct observation of a parton. of course, even for asymptotic states
the directness of experimental observations varies widely: for example, compare a
photon or electron to a neutrino. a closer analogy is unstable particles: for example,

c. high energy

531

the neutron is observed as a constituent of the nucleus (as quarks are constituents of
hadrons), but eventually decays outside (as quarks decay into jets of hadrons).

a similar analysis can be applied to the creation of any electroweak boson by

annihilation of a lepton with an antilepton.

find the corresponding process (particles) for positron-neutrino annihilation.
find the expected numerical value of both this and the above r in the stan-
dard model for energies well above the masses of all the fundamental particles.

3. parton model

we have already seen that in quantum eld theory coupling constants are usually
energy-dependent. however, the dependence is only logarithmic, and thus can be
treated as perturbative unless the relevant energy scale is within a few orders of
magnitude of the mass scale that appears by dimensional transmutation. in qed,
the value quoted for the electron charge is at the scale of the electron mass m. using
the result of subsection viiia2 (or viiia3) for the 1-loop propagator correction, we
nd (neglecting higher-loop corrections)

mqed

= e3/4e2

m

= 2.837890(82)  10280  mqed = 1.450159(42)  10277gev
(where for fun we have included the 1-standard-deviation uncertainties for this 1-loop
result as the gures in parentheses; the e in the exponent is the electron charge).
since the mass of the observable universe is of the order of 1080 gev, and the planck
mass (beyond which a particle will gravitationally collapse from its compton radius
falling within its schwarzschild radius) is of the order of only 1020 gev, there is
little worry of observing the qed landau ghost, even if qed were correct to that
scale.

on the other hand, the mass scale for qcd is (in the ms scheme)

mqcd  .2 gev

(this result depends on renormalization scheme, and is also an eective mass in the
sense that the usual experimental energy scale is among the quark masses, so the
high-energy approximation of the renormalization group is inaccurate, and the full
propagator correction with quark mass dependence should be used.) this indicates
that perturbative qcd is inadequate to describe properties for which the energy of
the quarks is low, such as hadron masses (although nonrelativistic quark models have
had partial successes).

532

viii. gauge loops

exercise viiic3.1

take masses into account in the simplest approximation: treat particles as
massless for energies above (twice) their mass, innitely massive for ener-
gies below. approximate the masses of higgs and superpartners of standard
model particles as about the mass of the z boson. then graph the strong
coupling 1/g2 in the supersymmetric standard model (see subsection viiia4)
as a function of the ln of the energy from the grand unication scale down
to where it vanishes (g = ), mqcd.

however, in certain processes a single parton (quark or gluon) in a hadron is
given a high energy with respect to the other partons, usually a quark by electroweak
interaction. in those cases, the strong (chromodynamic) interaction of that par-
ton with the others in its original hadron is negligible: it has been liberated. the
approach is then to factor the amplitude into a piece with the electroweak and high-
energy (hard) chromodynamic interactions of this parton, which can be calculated
perturbatively, and the low-energy (soft) chromodynamic part of the remaining
partons, which is left as an unknown, to be experimentally determined. (thus, the
hard part is the easy part, while the soft part is the dicult part.) the predictive
power is thus limited to the dependence of the amplitude on the energy of this parton,
and on the particulars of the electroweak particles involved.

another possible complication would be the eect of exciting many partons within
a hadron, indirectly through the rst partons interactions with the rest: then one
would have several terms to sum in an amplitude, each with a dierent unknown
soft factor, making the approach useless. originally, it was thought that the high
energy alone was enough to explain the parton acting as free once liberated from the
hadron (based on intuitive arguments), but soon it was realized that this possibility
depended totally on the high-energy behavior of the theory: it requires the decrease of
the coupling with increasing energy, asymptotic freedom (or superrenormalizability,
or niteness with eective asymptotic freedom through the higgs eect). based on
this property, one can show from the usual perturbation expansion that one soft factor
(per each hadron with an excited parton) is sucient as a leading approximation, a
property known as factorization. this feature is a consequence of the fact that the
dominant contributions to feynman graphs in this high-energy limit are those where
the values of the momenta of some of the partons are those corresponding to their
classical mechanics, as described in subsection vc8 and viia6.

this new approximation scheme is eectively a perturbation expansion in the
inverse of the energy being channeled into this parton. one neglects terms that are

c. high energy

533

smaller by such powers (including those from masses and renormalons), but incorpo-
rates logarithms through the renormalization group and other loop corrections to the
hard factor. since available energy scales are much nearer to mqcd than to mqed in
qed, such an approximation scheme tends to break down around two loops, where
the corrections compete with the neglected terms, ambiguities in renormalization
schemes, and the relative size (convergence) of successive terms in the expansion. al-
though the accuracy of the predictions of this approach cannot compare numerically
with those of qed, it is the only method to describe such processes that can lay
claim to being a theory, and provides direct experimental evidence of the validity of
qcd, both as a qualitative description of nature and as a valid perturbation scheme.
(as in the previous subsection, we also have processes where all the partons appear
only in intermediate states, or eectively so for nal states in total cross sections via
the optical theorem, so factorization is unnecessary.)

the most eective application of factorization is to deep(ly) inelastic scattering
(dis). (an equivalent method for this process is the operator product expansion,
but unlike factorization there is no useful generalization of it to general processes.)
in this process a high-energy photon (or intermediate vector boson) is exchanged
between a lepton (usually an electron) and a quark. (this is the leading-electroweak-
order interaction of a lepton with a hadron.) the quark and rest of the hadron
do not interact again: color singlets are obtained by the creation of soft partons
from the vacuum, which split from their own singlets and eventually combine with
the separated quark and hadron. for this process one calculates only the total cross
section, at least as far as all the strongly interacting particles are concerned (inclusive
scattering) but again this can be generalized to the observation of jets (exclusive
scattering). applying the optical theorem, and ignoring the leptons, the leading
contribution to this process is given by the tree graph for scattering of a vector


534

viii. gauge loops

boson o a quark, where the intermediate quark has a cut propagator. this is the
perturbatively calculated hard part, which is later attached to the soft factor. thus
the hard part is the lepton-parton cross section, while the soft part is the parton
distribution, giving the probability of nding a parton in the hadron with a particular
fraction  ( 0,  1) of its momentum p. to leading order this fraction is determined
by kinematics: since the hadron and scattered parton are treated as on-shell and
massless,

p2 = (q + p)2 = 0   = x  

q2
2q  p

so the (bjorken) scaling variable x is a useful dimensionless parameter even when
(at higher orders)  6= x. the energy scale is set by the square of the momentum q
of the vector boson.

there are several approximations used in this analysis, all of which can be treated

as the beginnings of distinct perturbation expansions:

(1) the hard part is expanded in the usual (loop/coupling) perturbation expansion
of eld theory. the leading contribution is that of the naive (pre-qcd) parton
model (leading order), where the quark that scatters o the photon is treated
as free with respect to the strong interactions. one-loop corrections (next-to-
leading-order) introduce the running of the coupling associated with asymptotic
freedom, which justies the validity of the parton picture. this is usually the
only perturbation expansion considered, because such corrections are logarith-
mic in the energy of the exchanged parton (rather than powers), and thus more
important and easier to isolate from the data. furthermore, by the usual renor-
malization group methods such logarithmic corrections can be reduced by careful
choice of renormalization scale (2 close to q2 in ln(q2/2)). two-loop corrections
lead to various ambiguities, and have not proven as useful yet. in particular, the
 function is scheme-dependent past two loops, making the dependence on the
separation between hard and soft harder to x.

(2) in calculating the hard part light quarks are approximated as massless. one
can rectify this by also perturbing in the masses, as a taylor expansion in the
square of each mass divided by the square of the vector bosons energy (m2/q2).

(3) in the explicit calculation the momentum p of the excited parton is assumed to
be proportional to the momentum p of the initial hadron. in the rest frame of
the initial hadron (which is massive in real life), this corresponds to the nonrela-
tivistic approximation of motionless quarks; one quark is then set into relativistic
motion by the photon, liberating it from the hadron. this approximation can be
corrected by a jwkb expansion (expressed in operator language, the operator

c. high energy

535

product expansion), also known as an expansion in twist (eectively, the power
of momentum transverse to p). however, this means a separate soft part for each
term in the expansion: since these are determined experimentally, such an expan-
sion would lead to a loss of predictability. thus generally (with few exceptions),
parton model predictions are restricted to high enough energies (q2) that such
corrections can be neglected. in this sense, this approach is very similar to low-
energy approaches to hadronic physics, e.g., nonlinear  models: useful results
are obtained at lowest order for describing physics in a certain energy range, but
outside that range the increasing loss of predictability, e.g., nonrenormalizability,
makes the approach less and less applicable. (another, related, similarity between
this approach and nonlinear  models is that both were originally described in the
language of the operator product expansion, as applied to currents. however, this
language was later replaced in both cases because of the diculty of evaluating
operator products of more than two currents.)

(4) expansions in renormalons (see subsections viic2-3) introduce new coupling con-
stants, eectively nonperturbative corrections to the otherwise perturbative hard
part. like all but the rst of these expansions, this leads to correction terms that
are down by powers of 1/q2. however, it should be possible to absorb this type of
correction into the previous one, since in principle the soft parts should contain
all nonperturbative corrections by denition.

the other common application of the parton model is to drell-yan scattering:
in this case two hadrons scatter producing, in addition to hadrons, a photon (or other


536

viii. gauge loops

electroweak boson) that decays into a lepton-antilepton pair. to lowest order, the
relevant diagram is the same as for dis (crossing some of the lines). because both of
the initial particles are hadrons, 2 soft parts are required; however, each of these is the
same as that used in dis (universality) so they do not need to be redetermined. in
fact, there is a direct progression from e+e to dis to drell-yan: the above diagrams
are similar except for the number (0  1  2) of soft parts (corresponding to the
number of initial hadrons); the leading contribution comes from the same diagram,
rotated to various positions (crossing).

more generally, we can consider not only hard parts involving identied quarks
in the initial state of the hard part, but also in the nal state, by examining jets.
thus, for soft parts we have not only the parton distribution functions, which
are probabilities found from amplitudes for an initial hadron  parton + anything
(summing over anything), we have fragmentation functions, which are probabilities
from amplitudes for parton  nal hadron + anything. in principle these are related
by crossing symmetry: the diagrams are similar to the previous, with the partons
connecting to the hard part, but the external hadron lines may be either initial or nal
(and the opposite for the corresponding parton with respect to the hard subgraph).
as for the parton distributions, the fragmentation function for any particular parton
and hadron is measured in one particular experiment, then used universally. (the
simplest is deep inelastic scattering for the parton distribution, and e+e annihilation
with one of the two jets  hadron + anything for fragmentation.) then the cross
section is generally of the form

da...b =xa...bz da    db faa(a)   fbb(b)da...b(i)

where da...b is the observed (dierential) cross section, a...b (not to be confused with
vector indices) label the dierent partons and a...b their hadrons (we leave o the
labels for non-strongly interacting particles), the sum is over dierent kinds (and a-
vors) of partons (and perhaps over dierent hard parts, if corrections down by powers
are desired), a is the momentum fraction for parton a of hadron as momentum, faa
is either the parton distribution function for a  a + x (x = anything) or the
fragmentation function for a  a+ x, and da...b is the hard cross section (calculated
perturbatively), which is just the original with all the hadrons replaced by partons.

in the above factorized expressions, since they are expressed in terms of unphysical
quark states. however, these hard parts satisfy renormalization group equations, as
calculated in the usual perturbative way. (of course, nontrivial contributions require
calculating beyond leading order.) this implies corresponding renormalization group
equations (see subsection viic1), the evolution or gribov-lipatov-dokshitzer-
altarelli-parisi (gldap) equations, to be satised by the parton distributions, so
that  dependence cancels in the complete cross sections. this determines the energy
dependence of the parton distributions. the equations take the form

2 d

d2 faa(, 2) =xb z 1

fab(, 2)pba(cid:18)

where faa describes a  a+x, fab describes a  b+x, the splitting functions pba
describe b  a+x (x = x+x), and the sum is over the intermediate parton b. for
hadron a with momentum p, the intermediate parton b has momentum p, and parton
a has momentum p, so / is as fraction of bs momentum. the kinematics are such
that 0  x      1 (momentum is lost to xs as a  b  a). the splitting
functions are calculated perturbatively from the corresponding renormalization group
equation for the hard part, since the combined  dependence must cancel in the
physical cross section.

for similar reasons, the hard cross sections are infrared divergent; the soft parts
of the complete cross sections deal with low energies. this leads to complications
beyond next-to-leading order, due to the fact that the renormalization group scale ,
which relates to ultraviolet divergences (high-energy behavior), and the factorization
scale, which relates to infrared divergences (it determines the division between hard
and soft energies), are in principle independent scales. this allows an ambiguity in
factorization prescriptions, in addition to the usual ambiguity in uv renormalization
prescriptions. (in more general processes there can be other energy scales than just
q2, each with its own factorization scale, further complicating matters.)

part three: higher spin

higher-spin (unstable) particles have been observed experimentally. whether
they are considered elementary depends on how their theory is formulated. in partic-
ular, a description of hadrons in terms of strings would have many advantages, such
as unication of all hadrons, manifestation of duality symmetry, and calculability
through an accurate perturbation scheme.

gravity and supergravity also include higher-spin particles. string theory might
also yield some solutions to some of their problems, especially renormalizability and
unication of all particles. such gravitational strings would dier from hadronic
strings in their mass scale and in the appearance of massless particles, including the
graviton itself (in contrast to the massive pomeron, the analog of the graviton in
hadronic strings). gravitational strings might require supergravity.

for these and other reasons supergravity and strings are two of the major areas of
research in theoretical high energy physics today (although not the only ones). most
of the discussion of this part is introductory, and can be covered earlier, but it is not
essential to the course; however, its inclusion in a eld theory text is essential at least
for reference.

ix. general relativity

before discussing supergravity we need to study ordinary gravity. both can be
treated as generalizations of yang-mills theory. we use this approach rather than
the traditional one, based on the metric, which is insucient for describing spinors or
supersymmetry: there is no useful denition of distance in anticommuting directions
in curved (super)space.

gravity is the only observed long-range (massless) force mediated by a higher-
spin (2) eld. it is relevant for astrophysics, cosmology, and unication, all of which
have applications to the particles of lower spin.

ix. general relativity

1. gauge invariance

general relativity can be described by a simple extension of the methods used to

describe yang-mills theory. the rst thing to understand is the gauge group. we start

with coordinate transformations, which are the local generalization of translations,

since gravity is dened to be the force that couples to energy-momentum in the same

way that electromagnetism couples to charge. however, these are not enough to dene

spinors. this is easy to see already from the linear part of coordinate transformations:

whereas so(3,1) is the same lie group as sl(2,c), gl(4) (a wick rotation of u(4))

does not have a corresponding covering group; there is no way to take the square root

of a vector under coordinate transformations. so we include lorentz transformations

as an additional local group. we therefore have a coordinate transformation group,

which includes translations and the orbital part of lorentz transformations, and a

local lorentz group, which includes the spin part of lorentz transformations.

clearly the coordinates xm themselves, and therefore their partial derivatives m,
are not aected by the (spin) lorentz generators. we indicate this by use of curved

vector indices m, n, .... on the other hand, all spinors should be acted on by the

lorentz generators, so we give them at indices , , .., and we also have at vector

indices a, b, ... for vectors that appear by squaring spinors. flat indices can be treated
the same way as in at space, with metrics c and ab to raise, lower, and contract
them.

some gravity texts, particularly the more mathematical ones, emphasize the use

of index-free notation. an example of such notation is matrix notation: matrix

notation is useful only for objects with two indices or fewer, as we saw in our treatment

of spinor indices in chapter ii. such mathematical texts consider the use of indices

as tantamount to specifying a choice of basis; on the contrary, as we have seen in

previous chapters, indices in covariant equations usually act only (1) as place holders,

indicating where contractions are made and how to associate tensors on either side of

equations, and (2) as mnemonics, reminding us of representations and transformation

properties. thus, the full content of the equation can be seen at a glance. in contrast,

many mathematical-style equations (when indeed equal signs are actually used) say

little more than a = b, with the real content of the equation buried in the text of

preceding paragraphs.

we therefore dene the elements of the group as

g = e,

where m acts on all coordinates, including the arguments of the real gauge parameters
m and ab and any elds. mab = mba are the second-quantized lorentz generators:
they act on all at indices, including those on ab and any elds that carry at
indices. as a shorthand notation, sometimes we will also write

1

2abmba = imi

(and similarly for other appearances of the antisymmetric index pair ab). we thus
have a combination of the matrix generators of section ib and the coordinate gener-
ators of subsection ic2.

exercise ixa1.1

sometimes its more convenient to perform explicit nite coordinate transfor-
mations in terms of new coordinates as functions of old, as in subsection ic2.
as an example for curved space we consider the sphere in arbitrary dimen-
sions. rather than the usual cumbersome angles, which introduce trigono-
metric functions into measurements of distances, we use coordinates which
manifest the slightly smaller rotational invariance of the corresponding at
space, as we did for scalar elds in subsection iva2.

a as in subsection iva2, we can derive coordinates for the sphere by constrain-
ing at space in cartesian coordinates to have unit radius. rather than
looking for an explicit solution as in subsection iva2, we can enforce the
constraint by the replacement

x 

y
|y|

so the at coordinate vector x automatically has magnitude |x| = 1 at the
expense of introducing the scale invariance

y = (y)y

coordinates? (this generalizes to quaternions in four dimensions.) show that
this results in

compare the result on ds2 of the scale gauge y0 = 1 (on the previous form)
to that of z0 = 1 (on this form).

exercise ixa1.2

more general scale gauges for the previous problem come from considering
the kind of projections made in map making, looking at the result of shining
a point light source through a transparent globe onto a plane, where the ray
from the source through the center of the globe exits it at the point tangent
to the plane.
instead of looking at the geometry of the rays, we consider
expanding this globe of unit radius through the plane in such a way that
the source remains at the same scaled position inside the globe. (the center
of the sphere moves while the source and plane remain xed, at least with
respect to each other.) the globe continues to expand until it intersects a
chosen point on the plane. explicitly, in terms of coordinates y of that point
with respect to the origin of the expanded globe, the distance on the original
(unit-radius) globe is

ds2 = dx2 =(cid:18)d

in general, the relation between rst- and second-quantized group generators is
the same as the relation between active and passive transformations, and the relation
between a matrix representation and the corresponding coordinate representation,
as discussed in subsection ic1, where in this case the elds are the coordinates. in
particular, the second-quantized lorentz operators mab have the same action as the
rst-quantized lorentz operators sab introduced in subsection iib1: for any eld ,
mh| = h|s, etc. the action of the lorentz generators on vector indices is thus
given by

[mab, vc] = v[ab]c  i[mi , va] = 1

2bc[mcb, va] = a

bvb

this implies the commutation relations

[mab, m cd] = [c

[amb]

d]

in explicit calculations, only two indices in the commutator will match, and they
reduce to simple expressions such as

[m12, v2] = 22v1,

[m12, m23] = 22m13

as for derivatives, when acting on functions instead of operators we can write the
action of the lorentz generator as simply mabvc without the commutator.

when spinors are involved in four dimensions, its simpler to convert all at

indices to spinor indices. in that case, we can write

for most of the remaining discussion of gravity, well limit ourselves to bosonic elds
in vector notation, which is easy to generalize to arbitrary dimensions. for spinors,
we must either choose a dimension and use its corresponding spinor notation (for
d  6), or work in mixed spinor-vector notation (which is much messier).

matter representations of the group work similarly to yang-mills. we dene such

elds to have only at indices. then their transformation law is

 = e

where the transformation of a general lorentz representation follows from that for a
vector (or spinor, if we include them), as dened above. alternatively, the transforma-
tion of a vector could be dened with curved indices, being the adjoint representation
of the coordinate group:

v = v mm  v  = v mm = emmv emm

however, as in yang-mills theory, it is more convenient to identify only the gauge
eld as an operator in the group. in any case, only the adjoint representation (and
direct products of it) has such a nice operator interpretation.

as an example of this algebra, we now work out the commutator of two transfor-
mations in gory detail: we rst recall that the coordinate transformation commutator
was already worked out in subsection ic2, using the usual quantum mechanical rela-
tions (see also subsection ia1)

[f, f ] = [, ] = 0,

[, f ] = (f )

for any function f . for the lorentz algebra we will use the additional identities

[mab, m] = [mab, m] = [mab, cdmdc] = 0

a. actions

all expressing the fact the lorentz generators commute with anything lacking free at
indices (i.e., lorentz scalars). the commutator algebra is then

one ne point to worry about: we may consider spaces with nontrivial topologies,
where it is not possible to choose a single coordinate system for the entire space. for
example, on a sphere spherical coordinates have singularities at the two poles, where
varying the longitude gives the same point and not a line. (however, the sphere can
be described by coordinates with only one singular point.) we then either treat such
points by a limiting procedure, or choose dierent sets of nonsingular coordinates on
dierent regions (patches) and join them to cover the space.

2. covariant derivatives

we can also dene covariant derivatives in a manner similar to yang-mills theory;
however, since m is now one of the generators, the  term can be absorbed into
the a term of  =  + a:

a = ea

mm + 1

2a

bcmcb

bc. now the action
in terms of thevierbein (tetrad) ea
of the covariant derivative on matter elds looks even more similar to the gauge
transformations: e.g.,

m and lorentz connection a

 = mm,

va = mmva + a

bvb,

 = mm + 

,

mm

a = ea
avb = ea
a = ea

mmvb + ab

cvc

mm + a



i.e., the covariant derivative a is essentially d elements (labeled by a) of the
gauge algebra.

exercise ixa2.1

write the transformation law and covariant derivative of an antisymmetric
tensor in spinor notation (f), and compare to vector notation as above.

note that the free index on the covariant derivative is at so that it transforms

nontrivially under

a = eae

546

ix. general relativity

explicitly, for an innitesimal transformation  = [,] we have

ea

m = (nnea

m  ea

nnm) + a

beb

m

a

bc = mma

bc + (ea

mmbc + a

d[bd

c] + a

dd

bc)

this commutator is the same as for [1, 2] in the previous subsection, except for the
two additional terms coming from the lorentz generators acting on the free index on
m transforms on its at index as the vector (dening)
a. in particular, the vierbein ea
representation of the local lorentz group, and on its curved index (and argument)

as the vector (adjoint) representation of the coordinate group. also, it should be
invertible, since originally we had  =  + a: we want to be able to separate out
m for perturbation theory or weak gravitational
the at space part as ea
elds. that means we can use it to convert between curved and at indices:

m = m

a + ha

v m = v aea

m  v a = v mem

a

a is the inverse of ea

m. furthermore, if we want to dene the covariant
where em
derivative of an object with curved indices, we can simply atten its indices, take the
covariant derivative with , and then unatten its indices.

flat indices are the natural way to describe tensors: (1) they are the only way

to describe half-integral spin. (2) even for integer spin, they correspond to the way

components are actually measured.

in fact, the above conversion of vectors from

curved to at indices is exactly the one you learned in your freshman physics course!

the special cases you saw there were curvilinear coordinates (polar or spherical) for
m was the usual orthonormal basis. only the notation was dierent:
at space. then ea
using gibbs notation for the curved but not the at indices, ~v = v a~ea, where, e.g.,
a = (r, , ) for spherical coordinates and ~ea = (r, , ) are the usual orthonormal
basis. thus, you probably learned about the vierbein years before you ever saw a

metric tensor. similarly, when you learned how to integrate over the volume element

of spherical coordinates, you found it from this basis, and only learned much later (if

yet) to express it in terms of the square root of the determinant of the metric. (with

the orthonormal basis, there was no square root to take; the determinant came from

the cross product.) you also learned how to do this for curved space: considering
again the sphere, vectors in the sphere itself can be expressed in terms of just  and
. and the area element of the sphere (the volume element of this smaller space) you
again found from this basis.

ponents of momentum in the radial and angular directions. on the other hand, one
component of pm is still the radial component of the momentum, while the other
component of pm is the angular momentum  a useful quantity, but not normally
considered as a component along with the radial momentum, which doesnt even have
the same engineering dimensions. in writing the hamiltonian, one simply squares pa
in the naive way, whereas squaring pm would require use of the metric.

exercise ixa2.2

m actually describes at space: use the fact
show that the above choice of ea
that pa transforms as a scalar under the coordinate transformations that ex-
press r and  in terms of cartesian coordinates x and y, and as a vector under
local lorentz transformations, which are in this case just 2d rotations, to
transform it to the usual cartesian pa = (m

.
x, m

y).

this direct conversion between curved and at indices also leads directly to the
covariant generalization of length: in terms of momentum (as would appear in the
action for the classical mechanics of the particle),

dxm
ds

pm = m

, m2 = p2 = papbab  ds2 = dxmdxnem

bab  dxmdxngmn
equivalently, the metric tensor gmn is just the conversion of the at-space metric ab
to curved indices. also, in terms of dierential forms,

aen

a = dxmem

a  ds2 = abab

the eld strengths are also dened as in yang-mills:

[a,b] = tab

cc + 1

where we have expanded the eld strengths over  and m rather than  and m so
that the torsion t and curvature r are manifestly covariant:

m = eme = m  t  = et e, r = ere

548

the commutator can be evaluated as before, with the same change as for going from
[1, 2] to [,a] (i.e., now there are two free indices on which the lorentz generators

in practice, a useful way to evaluate the commutator is to rst evaluate the com-
mutators of the lorentz generators with the whole covariant derivative, and then
subtract out the double-counted [m, m] term. this is particularly convenient when
considering some explicit solution to the eld equations with a reduced set of com-
ponents (e.g., spherically symmetric), so that explicit indices may be lost except on
the lorentz generators. schematically, we then calculate

this method turns out to be one of the two simplest ways to calculate explicit solutions
(as opposed to discussing general properties). (for examples, see subsection ixc5
below.)

550

ix. general relativity

it represents a symmetry; the existence of killing vectors depends on the particular
space described by the covariant derivative. it then follows from the jacobi identity
for [k1, [k2,]] that the killing vectors form a group, the symmetry group of that
space. invariance of the covariant derivative requires:

ak b + k ctca

b = 0  (akb) = k ctc(ab),

kab = 1

2[akb] 1

2k ctc[ab]

ak bc + k drda

these equations are referred to as the killing equations. (again, usually it is just
the rst equation, on ka, that is called by this name, but well use it to refer also
to the equations for kab, which are needed to describe the symmetry when acting on
spinors, etc.)

exercise ixa2.5

doing the same for general coordinate transformations k = k aea, examine
the condition for invariance [k, h] = 0 using the poisson bracket. using the
commutation relations for the eas, show that this implies the killing equation
(akb) = k ctc(ab).

exercise ixa2.6

solve the killing equations explicitly in the case of at space a = a. show
this gives the poincare group, including both orbital and spin pieces.

3. conditions

there are two kinds of conditions we can impose to eliminate some degrees of
freedom: gauge choices and constraints. gauge choices explicitly determine degrees
of freedom that drop out of the action anyway. if the gauge is not completely xed,
the form of the residual gauge transformations may change, since using particular
gauge parameters to x the gauge, rather than eliminating those parameters, may
just determine them in terms of the remaining parameters: we require that the
residual transformations do not violate the gauge conditions that have already been
applied. similar remarks apply to global symmetries: if they do not commute with
the gauge transformations for the gauge that was xed, then they may aquire extra
gauge-transformation terms to preserve the gauge choice. on the other hand, con-
straints are chosen to be covariant under the transformation laws, and thus do not

a. actions

551

alter them, while eliminating degrees of freedom that might otherwise appear in the
action (although not in all possible terms). furthermore, the simplest explicit solu-
tion to constraints can itself introduce new gauge invariances. (an example of this
situation is supersymmetric yang-mills: see subsections ivc3-4.) in this subsection
this analysis will be applied to lorentz invariance: we already saw that global lorentz
transformations are included in coordinate transformations, and that local lorentz
invariance is unnecessary when only integer spin (and in particular, pure gravity) is
treated. we now examine the consequences of eliminating this useful but redundant
invariance and the gauge eld associated with it.

of course, we can eliminate local lorentz transformations by hiding at indices:

for the vierbein itself, we have the local lorentz invariant

gmn = abea

meb

n

which is the inverse metric tensor. however, we have seen that tensors with at
indices have simpler coordinate transformations, and there is no way to get rid of at
indices when spinors are involved. furthermore, the metric has the constraint that it
have minkowski signature: this constraint is solved by expressing the metric in terms
of the at-space minkowsi metric  and the vierbein. thus, solving the constraint
introduces local lorentz invariance. (however, in this case the constraint does not
eliminate degrees of freedom, but only limits their range.)

the lorentz transformations in ab are redundant to those in m. the extra
gauge parameters also can be xed by an appropriate gauge choice: for example,
consider the gauge

ea

m = a

beb

m  lorentz gauge m[aeb]

m = 0

a coordinate transformation takes us to a dierent lorentz gauge, since the lorentz
gauge condition is not a scalar. this means that any coordinate transformation m
must be accompanied by a lorentz transformation ab to preserve this gauge, where
this ab is completely determined in terms of m. this is easy to see perturbing ea
m
about m

a : to lowest order we have simply

0 = (m[aeb]

m)  ab + [ab]  ab  [ab]

exercise ixa3.1

lets further analyze this gauge condition:

a by looking at the transformation of a vector, identify the specic terms in
the taylor expansions of m and ab whose coecients can be identied with
global lorentz transformations, in the approximation used above.

552

ix. general relativity

b using the same methods as exercise ivc4.3, and writing in matrix notation
m for some matrix h, solve explicitly for ab in terms of m and

ea
ea

m = (eh)a
m to all orders.

similarly, the lorentz connection a

bc that gauges the ab transformations is
redundant to the vierbein that gauges m:  can be completely determined in terms
of e by constraining the torsion to vanish. to see this, we rst notice that in the
general case the expression for the torsion in terms of the structure functions and
connection can be inverted to give the connection in terms of the other two. one
way to do this is to use the denition and permute the indices a  b  c (odd
permutations are redundant because of the antisymmetry of the equation in the rst
two indices):

tabc = cabc + abc  bac,
tcab = ccab + cab  acb
using the antisymmetry of the connection in its last two indices, we add the rst and
last equation and subtract the second to obtain

tbca = cbca + bca  cba,

abc = 1

2(cbca  ca[bc]),

cabc = cabc  tabc

since the torsion is a covariant tensor, we can freely set it to vanish without aecting
the transformation laws of the remaining objects (its a covariant constraint, not a
gauge condition):

tab

c = 0  abc = 1

2(cbca  ca[bc])

from now on we assume this constraint is satised. this simplies the form of curls
and divergences, which implies that  can be integrated by parts in covariant actions
(see below). however, we have already seen that the torsion is nonvanishing in su-
perspace (subsection ivc3): in that case the symmetry on at indices is constrained,
so the connection has fewer components than the torsion, and can be determined by
setting only part of the torsion to vanish. (see subsection xa1 below.)

show that there exists a gl(d) gauge

gab = ab

(assuming gab has the right signature), that gauge has as a residual at-index
invariance so(d1,1), and the resulting covariant derivative is identical to
that used earlier in this subsection.

b show that one can instead choose a gl(d) gauge

ea

m = m

a  gmn = gab

and that this completely xes the gl(d) invariance. since the vierbein has
a curved index, the covariant derivatives are no longer covariant: unlike the
previous gauge, to maintain this gauge any coordinate transformation must
be accompanied by a gl(d) transformation whose parameter is determined
b in
by the coordinate transformation parameter. find the solution for a
terms of m in the innitesimal case. compare with the transformation law
for curved indices (see subsection ic2). in this gauge the connection is known
as the christoel symbols.

prove that rabcd = rcdab follows from the bianchi identity r[abc]d = 0 and the
antisymmetry of rabcd in both ab and cd.

4. integration

the antihermitian form of the group generators was a convenient choice because
partial derivatives are antihermitian, and the generators of the lorentz group (which
is real and orthogonal) are antisymmetric in the vector representation. thus, the
generators are real. however, the group elements are not unitary, since hermitian
conjugation reorders m with respect to m. the x comes from noticing that

e = det ea

m   ln e = em
 = e1m 

 (e1) = e1 

aea

m = mmln e  mm

 m  (e1) = e1e





where the derivatives
 act on everything to the left,  now includes just coordinate
transformations, and we have exponentiated by the same method as for lie groups
in subsection ia3. (note that if we expand the exponential in a taylor series such
derivatives in all but the rst factor will hit s, just as for those in e acting to the
right.) any function that transforms in this way is known as a density (see subsec-
tion iiib1 for the 1d case). we can easily see from the innitesimal transformation
that a density times any scalar is also a density. this allows invariant actions to be
constructed as

s =z dx e1l

a. actions

555

for any scalar l. for cases without spinors we can also use

g  det gmn = e2  e1 = g

where gmn is the inverse of gmn. (in spaces of general signature, i.e., arbitrary numbers

of time dimensions, we should writep|g| so, e.g., in euclidean space we actually use
g. if we were even more general, and used |det | 6= 1, then it would also appear.)

this can also be understood in terms of dierential forms, since

and use it to show that the product of e1 with any scalar transforms the
same way as e1 (i.e., is a density) under a nite coordinate transformation.

556

ix. general relativity

by similarly evaluating

z dx e1(x) =z dx e1(x) =z dx e1(x)

from the results of subsection ixa2, we then have that covariant derivatives can

be integrated by parts in such actions, since

b = 0  z dx e1av a =z dx me1v m

exercise ixa4.3

derive the expression for the covariant divergence in terms of e and the partial
divergence by assuming integration by parts:

use this to nd a simple form for the covariant dalembertian on a scalar:

actions for matter are constructed in a similar way to yang-mills: starting with
the at-space action, replace ordinary derivatives with covariant derivatives. the new
ingredient is the extra factor of e1. this prescription, as for yang-mills, is unam-
biguous up to only eld-strength (curvature) terms, which can usually be eliminated
by symmetry requirements and dimensional analysis. (at least for low energies, we
want terms of the lowest mass dimension.) this uniqueness (at low energies or long
distances) is known as the equivalence principle: inertial mass (really energy,
but also momentum), as determined by the kinetic term, is the same as gravitational
mass, as determined by the coupling of the gravitational eld.

a simple example of matter is a real scalar eld:

s =z e1 1

4[()2 + m22 + ar2]

the constant a can sometimes be xed by symmetry: in the massless case, to preserve
the global symmetry  = , we must have a = 0. (for self-interacting scalars, this
generalizes to a global nonabelian symmetry.) to preserve conformal symmetry (see
subsection ixa7), also for the massless case, we need a = 1
4

d2
d1.

this form of actions in terms of scalar lagrangians also suggests we modify the

denition of functional variation for convenience and covariance:

s =z dx e1()

s


a. actions

557

or, equivalently, we use the covariant form of the  function,

(x)
(x)

= e(x)(x  x)

as in at space, the action for electromagnetism follows from gauge invariance:

s = 1

8e2z e1f 2

ab = 1

8e2z ggmngpqfmpfnq

where fmn = [man]. integration by parts then gives a simple form for maxwells
equations. such simple covariant equations of motion that dont require explicit

expressions for the lorentz connection appear only for antisymmetric tensors (which

in practice means just spin 0 and 1 in 4d).

exercise ixa4.4

methods related to dierential forms can be applied to these special cases:

a rewrite the above action for electromagnetism in terms of aa and covariant
derivatives. find the eld equations following from both forms of the action,

and use this to nd a simple expression for the covariant divergence of an

antisymmetric tensor with curved indices using just the metric. compare the

results of the previous exercise.

b by converting at indices on the covariant tensor abcd to curved, show that

gmnpq

and

mnpq

1

g

are also covariant tensors. use these, and the covariance of the curl (see

subsection ic2), to arrive at the same expression for the covariant divergence

of an antisymmetric tensor.

another example is a dirac spinor:

s =z e1  (aia + m2

)

where a are the usual constant dirac matrices, in terms of which the spin operator
appearing in  is the usual mab  sab =  1
2[ab]. in 4d, we can rewrite this in

5. gravity

the einstein-hilbert action for gravity follows from choosing the only available

scalar second-order in derivatives, the ricci scalar:

lg =  1

4r =  1

4rab

ab

this action normally has a coecient of 1/2 (compare yang-mills), but well gener-
ally use (natural/planck) units  = 1; then  is used only to parametrize expansion
about the vacuum and dene the weak-eld limit. (actually, planck units normally
use g = 1, whereas in our conventions  = 1  g = .) in any case, the s can
m, and then appear
always be absorbed (unlike yang-mills) by a eld redenition of ea
only in the denition of the vacuum (perturbative ground state, or solution that
denes the boundary conditions at innity):

a theory with spontaneous breakdown of conformal invariance: coordinate trans-
formations include conformal transformations, but this invariance is broken by the
vacuum, which introduces a length scale ().

exercise ixa5.1

consider the covariant derivative for nonvanishing torsion. by solving for the
lorentz connection in terms of the structure functions and torsion, express the
covariant derivative in terms of the torsion-free covariant derivative 
 and the
torsion. thus, any action in terms of  can be rewritten in terms of 
 and t ,
so any theory with a nonvanishing torsion is equivalent to a similar one with
vanishing torsion (assuming the action is only second-order in derivatives of
the vierbein, and thus algebraic in the torsion). take the commutator of two

s to nd the curvature in terms of the torsion-free curvature rabcd. write
the einstein-hilbert action with nonvanishing torsion in terms of r, 
, and
t , to nd:

r = r  (tab

since the last term vanishes upon integration, t appears as an auxiliary eld,
so r is equivalent to just r.

exercise ixa5.2

for some general applications, where the form of the vierbein is not specied,

a. actions

559

it is useful to have a more explicit expression for the action in terms of the
vierbein. we found in subsection ixa2 that for vanishing torsion

c use these results to calculate r dx e1r for the sphere in two ways: (1) by

showing r is a constant and pulling it out of the integral, and (2) by converting
it into a boundary term, where the boundary consists of innitesimal circles
around the coordinate singularities at the poles. (in general, even for spaces
without true boundaries, one has to treat the boundaries of patches as such.)

its also possible to add a cosmological term to the gravitational action:

scos = z dx e1

with the cosmological constant . this term has no derivatives, and is thus anal-
ogous to a mass term. however, it only contributes to the nonpropagating spin-0

mode of the vierbein (see later), so it doesnt give a physical mass, but does modify
the vacuum.

exercise ixa5.5

for gravity, a rst-order formalism follows from not imposing the torsion con-
straint (see exercise ixa5.1), so either the torsion or the lorentz connection
can be treated as the auxiliary variable.

exercise ixa5.6

as discussed in subsection iiic4 for yang-mills, in four dimensions we can
write a complex rst-order action for gravity that yields the usual gravity
action up to a surface term. for yang-mills, the complex action was obtained
by starting with a normal rst-order formalism and replacing the auxiliary
eld with its self-dual part.

(technically, this means we must either complexify the elds, or wick rotate
to 4+0 or 2+2 space+time dimensions, where the lorentz group factorizes.)

6. energy-momentum

in subsection iiib4 we saw that in the same way as a current in electrodynam-
ics or yang-mills is dened as the matter contribution to the gauge elds equation
of motion, sm /aa = j a (in that case sm excludes only the pure yang-mills ac-
tion), the energy-momentum tensor is dened as the matter contribution to the

562

ix. general relativity

gravitational eld equation (in this case sm excludes only the pure gravity action):

sm =z e1 abtab = 1

2z g(gmn)tmn =  1

2z g(gmn)t mn

the case where ab represents the invariances of the action implies restrictions on this
tensor: using the separate gauge invariance of the matter action gaugesm = 0 and
the matter eld equations sm /(matter) = 0 (as for the yang-mills case), gauge
variation of the gravity elds in sm implies

ab =( ab = ba  t [ab] = 0 : lorentz

 1
2(ab)  at ab = 0 :

coordinate

so coordinate invariance of the action implies local conservation of energy-momentum.

for example, for a real scalar eld:

s =z e1 1
2ab[()2 + m22] + a[(ab  ab) + (rab  1

4[()2 + m22 + ar2]

2abr)]2
 2tab = (a)(b)  1
notice that for a 6= 0, the energy-momentum tensor gets extra total-derivative terms
which are separately conserved in at space (since they come from the r2 term,
which is separately covariant).

exercise ixa6.1

using the action given in subsection ixa4 and the variation of the covariant
derivative from subsection ixa5, nd the energy-momentum tensor for the
dirac spinor, and use its eld equations to show this tensor is conserved.

note that this is not the same as ordinary conservation mt mn = 0: r gt 0n

does not dene a conserved total energy-momentum. this is in contrast with the
conserved current in electrodynamics, since we then can derive the usual global con-
servation law

0 =z ddx e1aj a =z ddx me1j m 

d

dtz dd1x e1j 0

on the other hand, its closely related to yang-mills, where aa = a leads to
aj a = 0 in terms of the derivative  covariantized with respect to the yang-mills
eld (as well as gravity, if in curved space), so me1j m = e1[iam, j m] 6= 0 (see
subsection iiic1).

however, if there is a killing vector ka, then the component of momentum in

that direction is conserved:

j a  kbt ba  aj a = (akb)t ba + kb(at ba) = 0

a. actions

563

(remember (akb) = 0.) some simple examples of this in at space are (ka)b = b
a
(translational invariance), for which the corresponding charge is the total momen-
tum, and (ka)bc = [b
a xc] (lorentz invariance), for which the charge is the total angular
momentum.

including the variation of the gravitational action, we get the gravitational eld

equations

rab  1

2 abr = 2tab

coordinate invariance of sg implies a(rab  1
2 abr) = 0, which also follows from
the bianchi identities: in that sense gauge invariance is said to be dual to bianchi
identities, one implying the other through variation of the action: in general, for any
gauge eld  with gauge parameter 

 = o,

0 = s =z dx (o)

s

  ot s



= 0

where the transpose ot is dened by integration by parts. positivity of the energy
(contained in any innitesimal volume) is the condition t 00  0. the addition of
the cosmological term modies the left-hand side of the above equation of motion by
adding a term 2ab.

although there is no covariant denition of total energy-momentum, in the case
where spacetime is asymptotically at (the metric falls o to the at metric suciently
fast at innity), one can dene a noncovariant energy-momentum tensor tab for gravity
itself which is covariant with respect to coordinate transformations that themselves
fall o at innity. (see exercise iiic1.2 for the analogous yang-mills case.) this
tensor satises m(t mn + tmn) = 0 (where t mn is the usual tensor for matter), so the
usual conservation laws can be derived for the total energy-momentum coming from
integrating t + t. many equivalent expressions exist for t. one way to derive it is to
expand the eld equations order-by-order in h as

1

2 (rab  1

2 abr)  lab  tab

where lab is the linearized part of the eld equations (see subsection ixb1) and tab
is the quadratic and higher-order parts. by the linearized bianchi identities, we know

0 = alab  a( 1

2rab  1

4abr + tab) = a(t ab + tab)

where we used the eld equations in the last step. note that there is a great deal
of ambiguity here: we could have linearized by expanding the metric around its at
space value instead of the vierbein, or by expanding rmn or rmn instead of rab, etc.

564

ix. general relativity

because of the expression in terms of lab  h, the integral of t + t, which gives the
total energy-momentum vector, can be expressed as a surface term, just as gauss
law in electrodynamics. since space was assumed to be asymptotically at, only the
quadratic part of t contributes in the surface integral, which is why there is so much
freedom in the denition of t. since t is not covariant, the energy-momentum of
the gravitational eld is not localized (coordinate transformations shift it around).
however, since the total energy-momentum is invariant, one can ask questions about
how much energy is radiated to innity, etc.

7. weyl scale

the simplest way to describe conformal transformations in eld theory is as a
local scale transformation. if the theory is not coupled to gravity, we couple it to
gravity as in yang-mills theory by replacing a poincare invariant lagrangian l(, )
with l(, ) (where all elds  have at indices), but also including the e1 factor
in the action. we then transform the elds as

ea

m  ea

m,

  w+(d2)/2

where  is the gauge parameter and w + d2
is the engineering dimension (scale
m has dimension 1, since
weight) of the eld . (see subsection iib1.) eectively, ea
its the only eld with curved indices, and thus any derivative must appear in the
mm, while the measure appears as dx e1. of course, the action
combination ea
wont be locally scale invariant unless it is globally scale invariant, i.e., has only
dimensionless coupling constants (and thus no masses).

2

if the gravity-coupled theory is invariant under this local scale transformation,
then the theory will be conformally invariant after decoupling gravity. this follows
from the fact that the most general combined coordinate and local scale and lorentz
a is exactly a conformal
transformation that preserves the at-space vierbein ea
transformation. this is equivalent to our previous denition in terms of the scal-
ing of the at-space ds2 under conformal transformations, since dxmdxngmn(x) =
dxmdxngmn(x) under coordinate transformations.

m = m

exercise ixa7.1

derive the usual conformal transformations by nding the most general local
scale + lorentz + coordinate transformation that preserves the at-space
vierbein.

a simple example is yang-mills theory. we look at the yang-mills eld with
curved index, since its gauge transformation does not depend on the vierbein. (am =

a. actions

565

mm + ....) to avoid interference with the yang-mills gauge
m + ... vs. aa = ea
transformation, the yang-mills eld with curved index must be scale invariant. then

transforms with a factor 4d, and so is invariant in d = 4 only.

exercise ixa7.2

consider a more general gauge eld a and eld strength f dened by

am1mn =  1

(n1)! [m1m2mn ],

fm1mn+1 = 1

n ! [m1am2mn+1]

where a is totally antisymmetric in its n indices. (such theories were en-
countered in exercise iib2.1b.)

a dene an action in terms of f 2. in what dimension d(n) is it conformally

invariant?

b show that this theory is related by a duality transformation (switching
bianchi identities and eld equations) to the theory with n indices on a new
a, where n = d  2  n, and d(n) = d(n).

c examine the cases n = d, d  1, d  2. note that the scalar obtained by
duality does not have an r2 term in its action, and thus is conformal only
in d = 2.

gravity is not scale invariant, but it will prove useful to examine its scale breaking
explicitly. to preserve gauge covariance and dimensional analysis, the scale transfor-
mation law of the covariant derivative must take the form

a = a + k(b)mab

m was dened above, and the linearity of  in  follows

find ka and kab in terms of k a and k ab.

exercise ixa7.4

covariant derivatives for at space in spherical coordinates can be obtained
from those of cartesian coordinates by a combination of coordinate and lo-
cal lorentz (rotation) transformations. however, there are simpler methods,
using a combination of transformations of a single coordinate and weyl scale
transformations:

a take the direct product of a sphere with metric d2 (in arbitrary coordinates)

and a line as

d s2 = d(ln r)2 + d2

then derive at space in spherical coordinates by making a scale transforma-
tion

to yield the metric

ds2 = dr2 + r2d2

show that the resulting covariant derivatives are

r = r,

i = 1

r ( 
i + mri)

where 
metric d2.

i are the covariant derivatives on the sphere corresponding to the

a. actions

567

b find  in terms of (r, , ) using the result of exercise ixa5.3. find  in
terms of r and conformally at coordinates xi for the sphere by rst deriving


i = (1 + 1

4x2)i + 1

2xjmij

from at 2d space by another weyl scaling.

many special cases of covariant derivatives can be derived completely by weyl
scalings. this includes the most commonly used ones, for cosmology and for static
spherical sources. the general procedure uses the following facts in the following
order:

(1) in a space of one dimension, we can choose

(there is no curvature in d = 1.)

d = 1   = 

(2) for a direct product space, i.e., where the metric ds2 can be written as the sum
of the metrics of two (or more) spaces, the problem for solving for the covariant
derivatives is separable. we can divide up the components into the covariant
derivative for one space and that of the other, each using only its own coordinates
and at indices (and thus lorentz generators):

ds2 = ds2

1 + ds2

2   = (1,2)

and similarly for the curvature.

(3) under a coordinate transformation, each component of the covariant derivative
(and of the curvature) transforms as a scalar. we need only apply the redenitions
of the coordinates, including those that appear in the partial derivatives:

a(x)  a(x)

(this actually applies the alternative x denition of coordinate transformation of
subsection ic2.)

(4) under a weyl scale transformation,

ds2 = 2ds2  a = a + (b)mab,

these steps can then be repeated as necessary. (the rst two steps alone lead to

exercise ixa7.5

use this method (as opposed to that of exercise ixa5.3) to derive the covariant
derivatives for the sphere in the usual spherical coordinates:

note that exercise ixa7.4a is just a repetition of these steps, for a new 1d
coordinate v which is redened as v = ln r, with a new  = 1/r.

consider a eld theory without gravity that has a conformally invariant action.
spontaneous breakdown of scale invariance produces a goldstone boson for that sym-
metry, the dilaton. any theory can be made globally conformally invariant trivially
by performing a local scale transformation and making the parameter the dilaton eld.

the dilaton can also act as a higgs eld: if we couple the dilaton to conformal
gravity (gravity with local weyl scale invariance), the higgs eect reduces conformal
gravity to ordinary (einstein) gravity. for example, if we introduce the dilaton into
pure gravity by the local scale transformation above (in analogy to the stuckelberg
model),

up to an (important) overall negative factor, this is the action for a conformal scalar.
the dilaton eld  is a compensator for local scale transformations, and acts as a higgs
eld for this gauge symmetry: by gauging it to its vacuum value hi = 1
 , we regain
the usual form of the gravity action. (alternatively, we can set hi = 1, and introduce
m.) in this formalism, where
 through the proportionality constant in hea
we require the action to be locally scale invariant, the terms which were conformally
invariant before coupling to gravity are easy to recognize: theyre just the ones which
have no -dependence. (this may require some eld redenition: typically rescaling
the matter elds according to their weight as above.) the cosmological term becomes

thus, conformal matter has vanishing t a

also need to scale the matter as above to achieve this decoupling, and there is a

after applying the matter eld equations, as in the derivation of at ab = 0 from
coordinate invariance in the previous subsection.) in particular, this is easy to check

an interesting eect is obtained by eliminating the compensator by its eld equa-
tion. (well consider just the classical theory here: in the quantum case, integrating
out this eld produces an additional 1-loop contribution to the eective action.) be-
cause this manipulation involves integration by parts, we rst expand the compensator
about its vacuum (asymptotic) value:

this action still describes einstein gravity, but is locally scale invariant (though
not globally, because of the extraction of the vacuum value, and the way boundary
terms were neglected). of course, it is nonlocal, and the nonlocality becomes more
complicated if nonconformal matter is included. such terms also appear quantum
mechanically: in two dimensions, dimensionally regularizing d=2+2, in a weyl scale
invariant theory we can get a divergent, yet still weyl scale invariant, contribution to
the eective action proportional to

we now consider various gauge choices for coordinate, lorentz, and scale trans-

formations.

1. lorentz

we begin with gauges that preserve global lorentz invariance, which are useful
for perturbation theory. therefore, we look rst at perturbation by nding the kinetic
term, which is sucent for nding linear gauge conditions. (it can also be derived from
general principles, as will be shown in subsection xiia5.) we expand the vierbein
about its at value,

ea

m = a

m + ha

m

at the linearized level, local lorentz invariance implies that only the symmetric part
of the eld, 1
2h(ab), appears in the curvature and the action; we will denote this by hab
to simplify notation. (in other words, the linearized curvature is invariant under the
linearized local lorentz transformations, which gauge away the antisymmetric part
of the eld. this is equivalent to working directly with the metric.) we then can nd
the linearized curvature, e.g., from the results of subsection ixa5 for the variation of
the curvature, by considering variation about at space: i.e., replacing ab  hab and
a  a. the result is

rab

cd  [a[chb]

d]

 rab  1

2 abr  hab + abhc

c  (achb)c  ab( hc

c  cdhcd)

since this comes from varying the action, the quadratic part of the gauge-invariant
action must be

sg  z 1

4[hab hab + 2(bhab)2  ha

a hb

b + 2ha

abchbc]

this part of the action, and the linearized curvature, are invariant under the linearized
gauge transformations hab = (ab).

exercise ixb1.1

take the newtonian (weak-eld, nonrelativistic) limit of gravity: (1) linearize
m). keep just the part
the action by perturbing about at space (ea
of the pure gravity action quadratic in the perturbation, the part of the matter
coupling linear in it, and the complete at-space matter action. (2) assume
small velocities. now consider the problem of a massive point particle in the

m = m

b. gauges

573

eld of a much more massive point particle (or spherical body); in the above
approximations:

a show the eect of the gravitational eld generated by the heavier particle on
the lighter particle is given by the action for the lighter particle (in the gauge
x0  t =  )

s = ms z dt (m  1

.
x2
i + mh00)

2m

b show this eld is given by solving laplaces equation

r00  h00 = t00

c show that, with our conventions for normalizing functional dierentiation, a

point mass m in d=4 generates

t00 = m(2)23(x)  h00 = 

m

r

using the usual solution to laplaces equation for a point source. combining
these results, we see that the potential energy for the particle is

u = mh00 = 

mm

r

which agrees with newtonian gravity if we identify g = . (if we restore
units, this becomes g = 2.)

the brst transformations (see subsection via4) for gravity again follow from

the gauge transformations:

qea

m = c nnea

m  ea

nnc m + ca

beb

m

qc m = c nnc m, qcab = c nncab + ca

cccb

q c m = ibm, q cab = ibab

(other forms follow from dierent parametrizations of the gauge transformations,
and are equivalent to eld redenitions. for theories without spinors, we can work in
terms of the metric, and avoid lorentz gauge xing.)

lorentz gauges for coordinate invariance are similar to yang-mills. for gravity,

the gauge-xing function is

fa = bhab  1

2 ahb

b

the brst procedure works similarly to yang-mills. looking at just the graviton
kinetic term, the gauge-xed quadratic lagrangian for gravity is then, in the fermi-
feynman gauge,

lg  lg,f f = lg + 1

2(bhab  1

plus ghost terms. note that the trace part of h appears with opposite sign to the
traceless part. this prevents any redenition which would allow rewriting the la-
grangian in the simple form  1
4 hab hab. however, all derivatives have been absorbed
s, which makes the linearized eld equation a simple klein-gordon equation.
into

there are various generalizations of this gauge condition to include nonlinear
terms, such as the de donder (harmonic) gauge, which uses the gauge-xing func-
tion

f n = 1

2m(ggmn)

for example, this allows the eld equation for a scalar to be written with only terms
with both partial derivatives acting on the scalar.

2. geodesics

consider the eld equations for coupling gravity and electromagnetism to a scalar
particle: from subsection iiib3, the action for a particle in external elds, rewritten
in hamiltonian form, is

sh =z d{ .

xmem

a(x)[a  aa(x)] + vh},

h = 1

2 2 + (x)

where we have pulled the v out of h for convenience, and use the covariant momen-
tum

a = ea

mpm + aa(x) = ea

m(pm + am)

in place of pm (the canonical conjugate to xm) for covariance. all the equations of
motion except the lagrange-multiplier constraint

follow from the usual poisson-bracket relation

1

22 +  = 0

v1 .

o = i[h,o]

which can be evaluated by using the canonical commutation relations (following from
the simpler ones for pm)

i[a, xm] = ea

m,

i[a, b] = cab

cc + fab,

[x, x] = 0

thus, a acts eectively like iea + aa, which is the covariant derivative for gravity
and electromagnetism, less the lorentz term. the

.
x equation is the obvious

va =

that follows from varying sh with respect to a, while the equation of motion for

using the relation

we nd

0 = tabc = cabc + [ab]c  ca(bc) + (bc)a = 0

v1 .

a  bcbc

a + f a

bb + a = 0

this is the coordinate-covariant form of the lorentz force law (plus scalar eld).
with only the gravitational eects we have the covariantization of the free particle
equation,

dpa  .

pa  vpbpcbc

a = 0

where d is understood as a covariantized  derivative (along a worldline with metric
v).

its useful to consider a continuum of particles (dust) moving under the inu-
ence of these elds, such that any two innitesimally close particles have innitesi-
mally dierent velocities, and only one particle passes through any particular point
in spacetime (at least within some small region of spacetime). we then can treat a
(or pm) as a eld dened for all x: choosing a point x also chooses a curve x( ) for
which x = x( ) for some  , so we can write (x) in place of ( ). specifying the
eld  also determines this family of curves, since the tangent to any curve is given
by the x equation of motion

.
x m = vaea

m

(to determine the  parametrization, we also specify v, and the hypersurface given by
the collection of points x(0) from each curve.) then we can express the  derivative
in terms of x derivatives:

.
x mm = vaea

which gives the manifestly covariant form of the equation of motion

for vanishing f (and thus a) and constant  (= 1

bb + a = 0

describes geodesics, which are curves of extremal length, since the action is

pbbpa = 0

s = ms,

ds2 = dxmdxngmn

ix. general relativity

for massive particles. these are the analogs of straight lines in at space.
(for
positive-denite metric, they are shortest lines. because of the indenite signature of
the minkowski metric, the worldlines of massive particles are actually longest lines,

while massless particles travel along lines with no length.)

exercise ixb2.1

uniform circular motion in 2d at euclidean space, constant d/dt in po-
lar coordinates, is associated with acceleration of constant magnitude. (or,
without time, we can say that a circle has constant extrinsic curvature with

respect to the 2d space.) show that an analogous situation in 2d minkowski
space can be obtained by wick rotation:

a starting with the metric for 2d at euclidean space in polar coordinates,
wick rotate  to make it a time coordinate (rindler coordinates). show
by a transformation to cartesian coordinates that this describes 2d at
minkowski space.

b show that any curve described by constant r describes acceleration of constant
magnitude, by evaluating (d2x()/ds2)2 in cartesian coordinates. note
that the direction of this 2-vector is xed to be orthogonal to dx/ds (since
(dx/ds)2 = 1 by denition), so this is just the acceleration as measured in the
rest frame.

c dene the acceleration in arbitrary curved coordinates (in terms of pp) and
evaluate it in wick-rotated polar coordinates, to obtain the same result as in
cartesian coordinates. (use the covariant derivative of exercise ixa7.4a.)

exercise ixb2.2

equations of motion for particles can be derived from conservation laws. we
know this already nonrelativistically, for a particle in a potential using energy
conservation. now consider a dust with t mn = mn and current j m = m.
(compare subsection iiib4. we could use those single-particle expressions
here, but using dust instead avoids integration. note that using  or p allows
us to describe also massless particles. the existence of a conserved current
corresponds to a complex eld with a global u(1) symmetry.)

a in the case with no external elds except gravity, show that the geodesic

equation follows from covariant conservation of both of these quantities. (of
course, in at space this gives the usual free particle result.)

b generalize to the case of external elds by adding to t mn that of the external
elds themselves. when taking the divergence of those terms, use appropriate

b. gauges

577

source terms to the eld equations in terms of the particle variables  and
. (in the case of a single nonrelativistic particle in a static electric eld,
this is the usual derivation of the force on a particle from the electric elds
pressure.)

for some purposes we need a weaker (but equivalent) form of the geodesic equa-

tion: if for some scalar f and vector na

(n  )na = f na  pa = una,

(p  )pa = 0,

f = (n  )ln u

for some scalar u, which we can determine by integrating f . in particular, we can
identify

u = v1  nm =

.
x m

thus, the more general geodesic equation allows arbitrary parametrization of the
geodesics, while the stricter version (f = 0) corresponds to ane parametrization
.
(v = 1) if we still want to identify p with
x. (remember, as with all constrained
systems, the equations of motion p  p = 0 imply (d/d )p2 = 0, so any geodesic
satisfying the stricter equation will have some xed mass along that particular curve.)

exercise ixb2.3

show that in d=2 (one space dimension, one time) any lightlike curve is a
geodesic, using the weaker form of the geodesic equation. (find f .) this is
a consequence of the fact that it is impossible to change direction in d=2
without slowing down.

the particle (geodesic) version of the conservation of momentum in the direction

of a killing vector is

p   pa = 0  p   k  p = 0 

d
d

k  p = 0

where covariant conservation p   has become ordinary conservation d/d (no con-
nection term) because k  p is a scalar. (see also exercise ixa2.4.) this is the same
as for the conserved current j a = kbt ba (subsection ixa6).

3. axial

the denition of axial gauges in terms of the covariant derivative is the same as

for yang-mills (n   = n  ). in terms of the explicit gravity elds,
bc = 0

m = nam

n   = n    nm  naea

a , naa

578

ix. general relativity

in the case of gravity, this implies that lines in the na direction are geodesics (see
previous subsection):

mna = 0  (n  )n = (n  )n = 0

to analyze the consequences of axial gauge conditions for the metric, we need a
ana,
further identity: for any vector eld na, consider the action of n   on nm = em
treating it as a scalar; in this calculation we ignore any indirect action of  on curved
indices. then

(n  )em

ana = (n  )em

ana = em

a(n  )na + na(n  )em

a

the last term simplies for vanishing torsion, since:

nnnem

a = nn[nem]
= mna  en

a + nnmen
amnn

we thus have

a = nntnm

a + nnmen

a = mna  en

(n  )em

ana = em

a)  (en

ana)mnn

applying this identity to the axial gauge condition, we nd

n   = n  ,

mna = 0  (n  )em

ana = 0  nm  em

ana = a

mna

by choosing the appropriate constants of integration.
(this amounts to xing a
residual gauge invariance.) we can now determine the form of the gauge condition
on the metric:

nm = nam
a ,

nm = a

mna  nm  nngnm = nnnm

applying these results to perturbation theory, as

m = m

a + ha

we then have

naea

m = nam

a  nbhba = 0
mb

em

ana = a

mna  ea

mnb = na  nbhab = 0

and thus nbh(ba) = 0, so we can again work with just the symmetrized h.

b. gauges

579

the lightcone gauge is again useful for eliminating unphysical degrees of freedom.

the lightcone gauge conditions are

na = a

  h+a = ha+ = h(+a) = 0

for the rest of this discussion we work with just the symmetrized h. separating out
the trace part as hij = ht
ij is traceless, we nd for the linearized
gauge-xed action

ij + ijh, where ht

where we have simplied some algebra by writing the gauge-invariant action as the
lorentz gauge one minus its gauge-xing term 1
2f 2. (there is some ambiguity in that
we can shift hi by a ih term, and absorb the generated terms into h.) we see
that all but ht
ij are auxiliary elds (we redened hi and h by just shifting and
applying +), and can be eliminated (but watch out if there are matter couplings,
when eliminating them gives coulomb-like interactions).

the temporal gauge (known also as gaussian normal coordinates) is used when

treating time and space separately: in this case we have for the metric

nm = m

0  g0m = 0m

an alternate way of dening the temporal gauge is to start with a spatial hypersurface,
and determine the geodesics normal to this hypersurface (g0i = 0), where the positions
on this hypersurface dene xi, constant along the geodesics, and the proper times
along the geodesics dene x0 (g00 = 1), with x0 = 0 at the hypersurface. the fact
that these are geodesics guarantees that the hypersurfaces of xed, but nonvanishing,
(proper) time are still orthogonal to the geodesics (g0i stays zero):

n  v = 0,

(n  )n = 0  n  [(n  )v ] = 0

equivalently, we can consider a dust of massive particles and choose an initial hyper-
surface orthogonal to their (timelike) geodesics to dene x0 = s = 0. this coordinate
system is thus the rest frame of the dust; all the information about the geometry of

580

ix. general relativity

the space is contained in the time dependence of the spatial separation of the particles
(gij). there is still the residual coordinate ambiguity of how to assign xi on the initial
hypersurface.

gaussian normal coordinates thus can be useful for studying the dynamics of
particles: for example, we can study a gravitational eld of distant, unknown (or
ignored) origin (i.e., the curvature of spacetime) by watching the relative motion of
two nearby particles of such a dust, neglecting the gravitational force/curvature eect
acting between the two particles themselves. if the two particles start out relatively
at rest at some initial time (which is well-dened only if they are close and relatively
slow), then in the temporal gauge the paths of both particles are described by xed
xi, independent of x0, since their geodesics are simply lines in the time (na = a
0 )
direction, and the proper times of both particles are the same as the time x0. then
the distance between the particles at any given time is given by the magnitude of
a, with dx0 = 0 and dxi their innitesimal separation. thus, since the xis,
dxmem
and thus dxi, are xed, we want to study the change in em
a = a
0 )
with time. using our evaluation of (n  )em

a from above, we nd

a (really just ei

a = (n  )mna = [n  ,m]na = nn[n,m]na = nbncrbdc

(of course, vanishing curvature implies geodesics that start parallel remain that way,
because the space is then at.) by observing dierent sets of particles initially at
rest with respect to each other, we can choose dierent timelike directions n, and
determine all the curvature components from their linear combinations.

exercise ixb3.1

lets examine some 2d examples of axial gauges in spaces with positive-
denite metric:

a gaussian normal coordinates need not be cartesian in at space. show that
polar coordinates for the plane dene an axial gauge. what is the coordinate
in the na direction? give the geodesic interpretation.

nates.

ixa5.3.) show its solution agrees with the obvious.

b. gauges

581

4. radial

another useful gauge similar to the axial gauge is the radial gauge (riemann
normal coordinates), discussed for yang-mills in subsection vib1. in this case we
have

nm = xm  (n  )na = xmmxna

n = na

a case of the more general form of the geodesic equation. applying the same identity
as for the axial, we again have

mna = a

n = n ,
but now the boundary condition is already implied by the gauge condition near the
origin: for any innitesimal xm = m,

m  (n )em

ana = (n )m

ana  em

ana = a

mna

a(0) = ma

a(0) = a
m
ab(0) = 0

thus, there is no residual gauge invariance, unlike axial gauges (where the coordi-
nates of the initial hypersurface need additional determination). any reference frame
satisfying these conditions at the origin is called a local inertial frame, and is the
most natural for an observer at that point in spacetime. (in at space, this yields
cartesian coordinates.)

exercise ixb4.1

we can think of gaussian normal coordinates as dened by a dust of particles
with ane parametrization v = 1 and unit mass m = 1, with  = s = x0 and
.
xi constant for any particle (
x = p = n). for riemann normal coordinates
we can think of particles radiating out from the origin xm = 0 in all possible
directions in space and time, but then some must be antiparticles (traveling

some must be tachyons, with m2 < 0 (for the spacelike geodesics). however,
as for the gaussian case, we can still identify

nm =

x m

using the radial gauge condition, show that these can be chosen as geodesics
with

v = e ,

x( ) = e x(0),

p = x(0)

so all particles start at the origin at  = , and their position at  = 0
(thus particles with

ix. general relativity

proportional momenta travel the same path, but arrive at dierent points at
 = 0; however, in this case  is neither the time x0 nor the proper time s,
but just an arbitrary parameter.)

as we saw in subsection vib1, the radial gauge is related to gauge-covariant

translation (in general relativity, parallel transport) as, for any tensor ,

(y) = exa(y)da(y) = e(y),

ym = exa(y)ea

m(y)dmym

where y is the origin,  = imi is just a lorentz transformation, and d is the
covariant derivative acting at y:

da = ea

m(y)dm + a

i(y)mi,

dm =


ym ;

[da,db] = tab

cdc + rab

imi

as in general for coordination transformation parameters a, xa now transforms under
local lorentz transformations. (in background eld language, this quantum eld
transforms under the background lorentz transformations.) thus, xa is now a
function of y; it cannot be made even covariantly constant in general:

daxb = 0  0 = [da,db]xc = xdrabd

c

(for more practical reasons, if we dened it to be invariant or constant, the manip-
ulations that follow would break down.) at this point we have only made a lorentz
transformation on , since it and  are evaluated at the same point y. however, as
for yang-mills in subsection vib1, for the next step we want to identify xa as the
new coordinate:

(xa) = (ym(ym, xa)) = exada(y)

where  has implicit dependence on y, since in radial gauges the choice of origin
is gauge parameters that dene the gauge. (the coordinates are dened as radial
with respect to the origin y.) thus, we have made a lorentz transformation   
followed by a coordinate transformation   .

we also want to dene a covariant derivative for x by
 = (d) = exadada(y)

where  (as for yang-mills) contains only a = /xa and not dm:

a = ea

b(x)b + a

i(x)mi

at this point we no longer distinguish at and curved indices, since the lorentz gauge
has been xed. we have then transformed

y, ,d  x, ,

b. gauges

583

note that the y-coordinate tensors are the x-coordinate tensors evaluated at the
origin:

(0) = (y),

()(0) = (d)(y)

we can identify this as the radial gauge when x(y) satises the geodesic condition,
since then

(x  d)x = 0  x  exdx = x

 x   = x  (d) = (x  d) = x  d = x  

making use of (x) = exd(y).

unfortunately, it is somewhat dicult to continue this construction in terms of
the covariant derivative, but simpler in terms of the dual dierential forms. we
therefore dene the (lorentz-covariantized) lie derivative as

lxd

 = x  d ,

lxd

d = [x  d, d]

for any tensor (object carrying only at indices)  and any covariant derivative
(object with a at vector index free, but multiplying partial derivatives and lorentz
generators) d. we generalize to evaluate on not only  and d, but to apply the
lie derivative also as part of the transformation exp(lxd). for that reason, for the
remainder of this section we will abbreviate lxd as just l. we then have

[x  d,da] = (daxb)db + xb(tba

cdc + rba

dening lie derivatives to satisfy the usual leibniz and distributive rules like any

which covers all the quantities that appear in evaluating el on e a and i. the
geodesic condition prevents higher derivatives of xa from appearing in the transfor-
mation law, and allows us to freely reorder all the xs to the left at the end of the
calculation for identifying the coecients of the taylor expansion, at which point
we can forget that x depends on y. thus, these few equations for the action of l
allow any transformed quantity to be evaluated straightforwardly by iteration, taylor
expanding el in powers of l.

the important distinction between the transformation laws for da and e a is
that for e a the derivatives of x appear only in the combination dx, which makes
changing coordinates from y (or y) to x easier. specically, by iterating the above
lie derivatives, we nd a solution of the form

however, we can also use these results for rst-quantization (where actions are
expressed in terms of, e.g., ea/d for the particle) in background eld gauges, by
choosing y as the background and x as the quantum coordinate (see subsection vib1);
then we keep both the dy and dx terms.

find the ghost terms for linearized gravity in the fermi-feynman gauge, and
its simplication with the compensator.

the scale gauge can also be xed in terms of the vierbein/metric alone: for

example, we can x the gauge

e = 1

in which case  acts simply as a renaming of e. a more unusual gauge is

r = 0

this is not a restriction on the geometry, since the physical ricci scalar is eectively
replaced by its scale transform

r = (d+2)/(d2)(r  4 d1

which is scale invariant. in the gauge  = 1, r = r, but in the gauge r = 0 it is
proportional to .

exercise ixb5.2

show that the ghosts for scale transformations propagate in the gauge r = 0:
find their contribution to the action.

more general gauges are possible when matter elds appear. for example, con-
sider coupling gravity, with compensator, to a physical conformal scalar . with
appropriate normalization of the compensator and physical scalar, the kinetic terms
for the two elds are identical except for sign: there is a manifest o(1,1) symmetry.
we can take advantage of this by using a lightcone basis for these elds: dening

4r)

the overall normalization is arbitrary, including sign, since we can rescale either eld
by a constant. many weyl scale gauges are possible, and somewhat more transparent
than making eld redenitions on the corresponding action without compensator.
eectively, we can redene the elds  arbitrarily as long as we dont x +/ to
a constant, since that combination is scale invariant. (i.e., +/ can be redened,
but not xed.)

some of the more interesting choices are:

4r)

+ = ,  = 1  l =  1

4r

we can also have any of these gauge-xed lagrangians with opposite overall sign,
simply by changing the choice of either + or  by a sign. the rst two choices
are useful because they put the action in standard form, as the usual gravity action
plus a physical scalar kinetic term. (thus, coupling a massless scalar to gravity either
conformally or minimally is equivalent, and the two cases are distinguished only by
interactions.) in fact, the rst choice, or temporal gauge + +  = constant, just
returns us to the form without compensator,  = 1. on the other hand, changing the
sign of  yields the axial gauge +   = constant, which is xing the physical
scalar as  = 1. the overall sign of the action changes because the physical scalar
is traded for the compensator, or the corresponding part of the metric. this gauge
is closely related to the string gauge: in our third choice above the gravity action
is invisible until the surviving scalar has been expanded about its vacuum value.
the constant a is arbitrary except that it must not vanish (so that +/ is not a
constant). in particular, this action appears in string theory, with the choice

1

a =

d  1  l = (  1

which eliminates explicit d-dependence. again the scalar appears with the wrong-
sign kinetic term, but r appears with the right sign (or vice versa), because of more
changes back to the usual for |a| > 1.
complicated redenitions. the sign of the
however, for |a| = 1, it disappears completely. a similar result occurs for the last
choice, or lightcone gauge  = 1.

exercise ixb5.3

the property that distinguishes this kinetic term for a scalar coupled to grav-
ity is the o(1,1) symmetry:

a before xing the weyl scale gauge, the continuous so(1,1) subgroup of this
symmetry is just the scaling   1. after gauge xing, this trans-
formation may change the gauge, and thus may need to be combined with
a constant weyl scale transformation to preserve the gauge.
in that case
the vierbein will also transform under the resulting modied so(1,1) trans-
m in the above 4
formation. find the so(1,1) transformations for  and ea
gauges.

588

ix. general relativity

b there is also the parity transformation of this o(1,1), +  . find the

modied form of this transformation for  and ea

m.

although all these choices are equivalent in perturbation theory (though the
physical scalar may require a nonvanishing vacuum value), they arent necessarily
so nonperturbatively, depending on the ranges of the various scalars. unfortunately,
nonperturbative gravity is not understood well enough (even classically) to make such
distinctions, even though they may be important physically. the above considera-
tions generalize straightforwardly to the case with many physical scalars, where we
may consider symmetry groups such as o(n,1). if the physical scalars form a nonlin-
ear  model, the compensator may join in to make the -model groups noncompact:
examples of this appear in supergravity and strings (see below).

the appearance of a physical scalar can also aect the way scale gauges are chosen
in conjunction with coordinate gauges. for example, a result similar to the one found
at the beginning of this subsection can be obtained from the (linearized) action with
both compensator and physical scalar  (where hi = 0),

l  l0  1

choosing the same -dependent coordinate-xing term (fa)2, but imposing the scale
gauge

(  ha

a)

the result is identical to the one given at the beginning of this subsection, except
that now no scale ghosts appear: the scalar that appears as ha
a is now physical, and
no longer needs a ghost to cancel it. this is the perturbative string gauge for scale
invariance, which appears automatically in covariantly gauge-xed string theory.

exercise ixb5.4

lets investigate such gauge choices further:

a starting with the fermi-feynman-gauge-xed linearized gravity action of sub-
section ixb1, add the physical-scalar kinetic term  1
4  . separate the
traceless and trace pieces of hab. show that the string-gauge action (i.e, the
one given at the beginning of this subsection if we ignore ghosts) follows from
simply switching

and then identiying the new  with 2/(d  2).

a

b the way the physical scalar of string theory appears in the gauge-invariant
and gauge-xed action is slightly more clever than as described above. (see

b. gauges

589

subsections xib5-6 below.) the kinetic term (already in the string gauge for
scale invariance) is

s =z dx (  1

4 r)

where the missing e has been absorbed into  by a eld redenition. (since
 is thus not a scalar, we dene  by e1/2 e1/2, since e1/2 is a scalar.)
expanding  = 1 + , the linearized gauge xing is now simply

there are some important solutions of general relativity that have no close analog
in yang-mills. here we consider the ones relevant to the only experimental verica-
tions of this theory: solutions outside approximately spherical matter distributions
(like the sun and earth), and those describing the universe itself.

1. self-duality

plane wave solutions can be constructed for gravity in the same way as for yang-
mills (see subsection iiic3): a little more work (solving the torsion constraint, or
using the result of the free theory) gives

+ = +  1

2xixjr+i+j(x)  xir+i+j(x)mj

( = , i = i)

where r+i+j is an arbitrary function of x, but symmetric in ij, and the empty-space
eld equations imply it is also traceless:

r+i+i = 0

if we want to couple yang-mills to gravity, then we can still write exact solutions as
long as both waves are parallel; then

r+i+i = 2t ++ = 1

g2 tr(f +if +i)

where here g2 refers to the yang-mills coupling. (similarly, we can add in other elds,
such as massless, neutral scalars or particles.)

exercise ixc1.1

check that the gravitational plane wave solution satises the eld equations
and torsion constraint. show that we can also nd more-special solutions of
this form satisfying

gmn = mn + 1

g2 tr(aman),

rmnpq = 1

g2 tr(fmnfpq)

this has the interpretation that the graviton is the bound-state of two
gluons. however, it is only a kinematic eect, since the two gluons happen
to be traveling in the same direction at the same speed. (we saw in subsection
viiia7 that a similar eect always occurs in d=2, since there only two spatial
directions exist.)

while it might appear that the self-duality condition is still second-order because
solving the torsion constraint makes the lorentz connection the derivative of the
vierbein, the self-duality allows the gauge where the connection is also self-dual, and

the simplest spaces are those where the ricci scalar is constant, and the other

parts of the curvature vanish:

these are special solutions of the eld equations without matter, but with a cosmo-
logical term, where there are no physical gravitons (the weyl tensor vanishes), and
thus represent the vacuum. since there are no physical degrees of freedom, we can
represent this space by just the conformal compensator:
i.e. the vierbein (metric)
is just the at one up to a local weyl scale transformation. we thus have (from
subsection ixa7)

cd =
where we have written the curvature as a scale transformation of at space rab
0,  = : the space is conformally at. separating this equation into its ir-
reducible parts with respect to the lorentz group, the weyl tensor part vanishes
identically, leaving

2   d()2 = dk, dab = ab 

(the latter equation isnt implied in d = 2, where the global conformal group is
larger, and more general coordinate choices are possible for this solution. however,
we can still use it consistently.) the latter equation can be solved easily: looking at
a 6= b, we see that  is a sum of functions of one variable. then looking at a = b tells
us that these functions are quadratic and have the same quadratic coecient, while
the former equation gives k:

 = a + baxa + c 1

2xaxa,

k = 2ac  b2

we can choose any a, ba, and c that give the desired value of k: for example, we
can choose the solution  = 1 + 1
4 kx2 (giving the usual at-space coordinates for
k = 0), or  = baxa (choosing the direction of ba as appropriate to k = b2 
spacelike, lightlike, or timelike).

exercise ixc2.1

show that after a weyl scale transformation the action for gravity including a
cosmological term is (up to a sign) that of a conformal self-interacting scalar
coupled to gravity. use this to show that the de sitter space solution (in the
r=0 gauge) yields an instanton for this scalar theory, and compare with the

c. curved spaces

593

yang-mills instanton of subsection iiic6. show that similar solutions exist
for massless scalars in arbitrary dimensions with potentials  n for arbitrary
n (but then k = 0).

the geometry of this space can be understood most easily as that of a d-
dimensional hyperboloid embedded in a at (d+2)-dimensional space, where we add
one space and one time dimension: again using the methods of subsections ia6 and
iva2, we now supplement the constraint

y2 = 0  ya = ewa,

(w+, w, wa) = (1, 1

2xaxa, xa)

with the additional constraint

naya = 1  e =

1

nawa

=

1
n  n+ 1
2 xaxa + naxa

where na is a (d+2)-vector, yielding the intersection of a cone and plane. in partic-
ular, for n2 6= 0 we can write the metric on the space whose coordinates are all but
n  y:

ya = (|n2|1/2, za)  z2 + n2 = 0,

ds2 = dz2

which is the denition of a hyperboloid. comparing the metric, we nd the previous
result:

ds2 = dy2 = e2dxadxa,

e = 1  k = n2

of course, by appropriate choice of the original at space, we can choose a space
of any signature. in particular, we see that for a unit sphere k is normalized to 1.
thus, with our conventions we have in that case

unit sphere : rab

cd = c

[ad
b]

(but the constant value of the ricci scalar will depend on the dimension).

this gives the most general coordinate system for de sitter space as a local scale
of at space, since conformal transformations are the most general coordinate trans-
formations that will just replace this scale factor with another, and they just rotate
na. the symmetry group of the d-dimensional subspace that satises these two con-
straints is as big as the poincare group, namely so(d,1), iso(d1,1), or so(d1, 2),
depending on whether n2<, =, or >0: the former constraint preserves the conformal
group, while the latter kills a timelike, lightlike, or spacelike coordinate.

exercise ixc2.2

we can also start instead with a d+1-dimensional space, which is a natural

594

choice for the symmetry group of de sitter space: consider the metric and
constraint

k ds2 = dz2 = k dzadzbab + dz2

d+1,

1 = z2 = k zazbab + z2

d+1

both equations have the same global symmetry group, determined by the sign
of k; k = 0, at space, can be considered as a limiting case of the others.

a solve the constraint y2 = 1  z(x) as in subsection iva2 for 2 = m2  (),

and substitute to nd the metric in terms of x.

b find the conformal transformation on xa that relates this coordinate sys-
tem to the more general one above. (hint: use z of the d+2-dimensional
construction.)

3. cosmology

to a good approximation the universe can be described by a spacetime which is
(spatially) rotationally invariant (isotropic) with respect to a preferred time direc-
tion. furthermore, it should be (spatially) translationally invariant (homogeneous),
so the metric should depend only on that time coordinate. this means that the 3d
subspace at any xed time should be 3d spherical, at, or de sitter space, up to an
overall time-dependent scale factor:

ds2 = d 2 + 2( )

where  is the de sitter metric for the 3 other dimensions for k = 1, 0,1 (given,
e.g., by the coordinates in the previous subsection.) by a simple redenition of the
time coordinate, this can be put in a form which is conformal to a static space:

ds2 = 2(t)bds2,
d = dt   t =z d

bds2 = dt2 + 

1

( )

or

where by (t) we really mean ( (t)), and the two time coordinates are related
by

 =z dt ( (t))
using previous results for 3d de sitter space, we nd bds2 has curvature

kl = kk

rest = 0

[il
j],

rij

where k = 1, 0,1.

to a good approximation the matter in the universe can be approximated as a
dust, a collection of noninteracting particles. it should also be rotationally invariant

c. curved spaces

595

with respect to the preferred time direction, so the momenta of the particles should
be aligned in that time direction.
(really it is this matter that denes the time
direction, since it generates the curvature of spacetime.) furthermore, the dust should
be translationally invariant, so the energy-momentum tensor should depend only on
that time coordinate. we then can write (compare exercises iiib4.2 and ixb2.2)

t ab
m = m (t)uaub,

ua = a
0

where m is just the spatial density of particles in the rest frame. one way to
derive the  dependence of m that generalizes straightforwardly to other cases is by
using conservation laws: by considering particles all of the same mass in units m = 1,
or by considering j and t for each individual particle (since in this case we neglect
interactions), we have from current conservation

j a = m ua  0 = aj a = eme1j aea
 m = 3a3

m = (4)0(4)(m 1)

for some nonnegative constant 3a, and using (covariant) energy-momentum conser-
vation as a check,

m = ubaj a + j aaub = 0
uaaub = 0ub = 10ub = 0 (geodesic)  at ab

tives)

for radiation, the momenta of the photons cant be timelike (theyre lightlike, of
course), but we can still use rotational and translational invariance, together with the
fact that the trace of the energy-momentum tensor vanishes (from scale invariance:

writing the vierbein as a scale-transformation of the constant curvature space
discussed above (de sitter in spatial directions, at in other directions), the gravita-
tional eld equations with matter and radiation become (using results from subsection
ixa6 or 7):

for k = 1, these are just energy conservation and the equation of motion for a
harmonic oscillator (centered at  = a). the 00 equation gave energy conservation
because t00 is the energy density. the trace equation gave the eld equation for ,
which is proportional to the time derivative of the 00 equation, due to the relation
of t a

4. red shift

the most obvious eect of the cosmological expansion is the cosmological red
shift. the expansion of the universe causes photons to lose energy, including those
of the black-body radiation of the universe as well as those emitted long ago from
distant sources. the easiest way to see this is to consider killing vectors. since
the cosmological solutions are related to static, isotropic, homogeneous spaces by a
time dependent (but space independent) scale transformation, the symmetries of this
space are just in the spatial directions, and are basically the same as before the scale
transformation. specically, the killing vectors that survive the scale transformation

a = ba + (bb)mab satisfy (see excercise ixa7.3)

bk b = 0  k = bk  ka = 1bka

we then nd for conserved momenta k apa  1pa. since the ks which survive are
just the spatial ones, we at rst nd only the spatial components of 1pa conserved,
but the conservation of the time component follows from papa = 0 for photons. thus,
pa    1. since pa is what an observer measures as the components of momentum
(in his local inertial frame, a gauge where at his location the metric is at and
its rst derivative vanishes), observers measure the photons energy, frequency, and
corresponding black-body radiation (whose distribution depends only on e/t ) as
having time dependence  1 (and wavelength as ). the spectrum of radiation
emitted by a distant object is then shifted by this energy loss, so the amount of shift
determines how long ago it was emitted, and thus the distance of the emitter.

exercise ixc4.1

using this result for the  dependence of the momenta of individual particles,
we can now rederive the  dependence of s of the previous subsection directly

c find the factors multiplying the s in t ab for the two cases of dust and

all particles can be taken at rest, but for the massless case the particles travel
at the speeed of light, so average over particles traveling in the three spatial
directions. ( is a continuous function obtained by summing the  functions
of all the particles. however, for the above results it is sucient to consider
each individual particle for the massive case, and 3 particles at the same point
going in orthogonal directions for the massless case.)

astronomers use 3 parameters which are more directly observable. the size
of the universe  is dicult to measure, but we can measure the change in time
of this scale through red shifts: comparing lengths at dierent times, we measure
(2)/(1), more conveniently represented in terms of the dierence of the ln: in
terms of the derivative, we have

ln(cid:18)(2)

(1)(cid:19) z 2

1

d h( )

the hubble constant h measures the expansion rate, and gives an inverse length
(time) scale. its own rate of change can be dened in terms of a dimensionless quantity
by comparing its inverse with the true time:

d(h1)

d  1

q 

the deceleration parameter q tells how fast the expansion rate is slowing down.
dening another dimensionless parameter to measure energy density by using h1
as a length scale, we have the 3 parameters

h

q  

 d2/d 2
(d/d )2 ,



3h 2

 

where  = t 00 = m + r. note that in our conventions spatial integrals are weighted

asr dd1x/(2)d/2; thus the relation of our density to the more standard one is (see,

e.g., exercise ixc4.1a)

 = (2)2usual   =

4
3 gusual

h 2

where g =  in our conventions (but sometimes g = 1 is useful, especially for
solutions describing stars and planets. see exercise ixb1.1.) the density parameter
 measures matter density with respect to the amount needed to close the universe.
in the case of pure matter, and with vanishing cosmological constant,  = q. then
the critical value is q = 1
2, k = 1, while for q < 1
2,

2 , for which k = 0: for q > 1

c. curved spaces

599

k = 1. in this case we also see that for a given value of h the critical value of the
matter density is c = 3
2 h 2. if the matter of the universe has this density, we have
k = 0, and spacetime is conformally at. if it has greater density, we have k > 1, and

space is closed.

exercise ixc4.2

particular, show

these quantities are dicult to measure. some recent estimates for their present

values are:

h1 = 14(2)  109 yrs.,

.02 < q < 2

even the gravitational constant is not so easy to measure: its presently accepted

value is

g = 6.67259(85)  1011m3kg1s2

which is accurate to only a few parts per 10,000, compared to the standard atomic

and nuclear constants, which are known to better than 1 part per million. in natural
(planck) units, c = g/ = h = 1, h1 = 1.5(2)  1061.

5. schwarzschild

all gravitational experiments outside of cosmology are based on the schwarz-

schild solution, which describes spherical symmetry outside the region with matter.

assuming also time independence, which is a consequence of spherical symmetry

(birkhos theorem), we look for a metric of the form

ds2 = a2(r)dt2 + b2(r)dr2 + r2(d2 + sin2 d2)

(other coordinate choices are possible, e.g. a2(r)dt2 + b2(r)[dr2 + r2(d2 +
sin2 d2)].) the rst step is the choice of a vierbein: the simplest choice following
from this metric is

et = at,

er = br,

e =

e =

cs (vanishing torsion):

(this can also be used as a starting point in place of the metric.) the next step is to
nd the commutators of the es, which tells us what  terms the s must have to
cancel these cab
[e, e] = r1cot  e
r = br
[er, et] = b(ln a)et
t = at + mtr

[er, e] = r1be
 = (r sin )1 + mr + m
[er, e] = r1be
where , , and  depend only on r, while  depends also on . (their explicit forms
are already clear at this point, but well collect the results below.)

 has m
t has mtr
 has mr
 has mr





we can now determine these lorentz connections and compute the curvatures by
calculating the  commutators. since we now use explicit functions for the vierbein
and connections, we use the method described in subsection ixa2 for this situation:
using the identities

[m12, v2] = 22v1,

[m12, m23] = 22m13

[1,2] = [e1 + 1, e2 + 2]

= {[e1, e2] + (e12)m2  (e21)m1} + {1[m1,2]  2[m2,1]  12[m1, m2]}
we then nd:

exercise ixc5.1

find the covariant derivative for the 2-sphere in spherical coordinates

ds2 = d2 + sin2 d2

in terms of the single so(2) generator mab = abm by the above methods (and
not that of exercises ixa5.3 nor ixa7.5). calculate the curvature. find the
three killing vectors. (hint: what is the symmetry of the sphere?)

a simpler method of nding covariant derivatives and curvatures in this case is
the weyl scale method of subsection ixa7. (we already applied this method to the
much simpler example of cosmology in subsection ixc3.) we start with the trivial
covariant derivatives for the 2d metric

ds2 = dt2 + dr2

which are just partial derivatives (zero curvature). then we make the coordinate
transformation

dr 

a(r)
b(r)

(explicit integration of this expression isnt needed in either the metric or the covariant
derivatives), which modies one of the covariant derivatives,

ds2  dt2 +

while the curvature still vanishes. (we have only chosen non-cartesian coordinates

to obtain the metric

applying the general formula

ds2 = (ra)2dt2 + (rb)2dr2

ds2 = 2ds2  a = a + (b)mab,

602

we nd

(ln ra)(cid:21)

any 2d space can be expressed as a scale transformation of at space locally, es-
sentially because the curvature has only one component. (globally this is not true,
since the integral of the curvature, which is scale invariant in d=2, is dierent for
dierent topologies. this is related to the fact that for nontrivial topologies more
than one coordinate patch is needed; the missing part of the integral can be hidden
in the boundaries of the patches: see exercise ixa7.6.)

now we should repeat this procedure for  and  to get the covariant derivatives
for the (2-)sphere, but this has already been done earlier. besides, we dont need
those expressions explicitly, since spherical symmetry means they vanish on anything,
and we already know the curvature of a sphere. (so, we can also avoid choosing a
coordinate system for the sphere.) thus we can immediately take the direct product
of the sphere with the above 2d space, and make the nal scale transformation

where i = (t, r), and the s and r on the right refer to the 2d t-r space just before
or after the direct product. the result also reproduces the previous. the nal result
for rtrtr can be obtained even more simply by noting that it agrees with what we
would have obtained by a single scaling for the 2d space ds2 = a2dt2 + b2dr2,
because of the triviality of the  and  derivatives.

having all the curvatures, we can now calculate the ricci tensor, which appears

in the eld equations. the nonvanishing components are:

rtt = rtrtr + 2rtt, rrr = rtrtr + 2rrr, r = r = rtt + rrr + r
vanishing of rab 1
2 abr is equivalent to vanishing of rab. in terms of these curvatures,
we see it also implies

rtrtr = 2rtt = 2rrr = r

these are easy to solve: first,

rtt = rrr  (ln a) = (ln b)  a = b1

where we have xed the proportionality constant by requiring a, b  1 as r  
(redening t by a constant scale transformation). also,

for some constant k. the last eld equation is then redundant. (as usual, the eld
equations are related by the bianchi identity.) the constant k can be related to the
nonrelativistic result by comparing at large distances. (see exercise ixb1.1.) we
then nd k = 2gm, so the nal result is:

exercise ixc5.2

repeat this weyl scale derivation of covariant derivatives and curvatures for
the schwarzschild metric in dimensions d>4.
(hint: do not use explicit
expressions for the covariant derivatives of the higher-dimensional sphere.)
solve for a and b.

more generally, if we have some spherically symmetric, static matter distribu-
tion, then the only nonvanishing components of the energy-momentum tensor will be

604

ix. general relativity

ttt, trr, and t = t (representing energy density, radial pressure, and isotropic
pressure), all functions of just r. repeating the above procedure, we integrate

[r(1  b2)] = 2r2ttt,

[ln(ab)] = 

r
b2 (ttt + trr)

while the remaining equation is redundant.

for example, for a spherically symmetric, static electromagnetic eld the only
nonvanishing components of the eld strength are ftr and f, corresponding to
electric and magnetic charges, respectively. then the invariance of t under a duality
transformation (see subsections iia7, iiia4) implies

t = t  ttt = trr  a = b1

again, since on this fab duality eectively replaces (, )  (it, r), with the i from
wick rotation. local scale invariance (see subsection ixa7) then tells us

ta

a = 0  ttt = trr = t = t

exercise ixc5.3

lets rederive these results by brute force:

a derive tab for a general electromagnetic eld by varying its action with respect

to ea

m or gmn.

b find each of t s components explicitly in terms of ftr and f in the case
where those are the only nonvanishing components, and show they appear
only in the combination f 2

tr + f 2
.

as usual, these eld strengths can be found easily from the integral form of gauss

law by integrating over a sphere: for example, for the magnetic eld

magnetic charge  1

2z dxmdxn fmn = 4r2f

for the f component of fab (integrating over  and ), since the metric (and vierbein)
for  and  is the same as for at space. by duality, the solution for ftr in terms of
the electric charge is the same. the result is

ttt =

q
r4 ,

q = 2(e2 + g2)

for electric charge e and magnetic charge g. the 1/r4 dependence also follows from
scale invariance, since the charges are dimensionless (and the matter eld equations
decouple from a and b). (again, since the solution does not extend to r = 0, we

c. curved spaces

normalize by comparing fab or tab at r =  to the at-space solution.) the net

lets also apply brute force to solving maxwells equations af ab = [afbc] =
0 (outside the matter).

a as a warm-up, using directly the above covariant derivatives, show that in

at space

v a = a

r vr  aj a = r2rr2jr

note that the covariant derivative of a vanishing component doesnt necessar-
ily vanish (just as the ordinary derivative of a function that vanishes at some
point doesnt necessarily vanish at that point): components of  other than
r contain lorentz generators that rotate other components of v to vr.

b solve maxwells equations in dierential form for fab in the above case. use
the empty-space solution to dene the normalization at innity. (actually,
in this case, the charge is well-dened in terms of the ux of the elds, as
described above, but gives the same result here because the space is asymp-
totically at.)

exercise ixc5.5

spherically symmetric solutions can also be written in eddington-finkelstein
coordinates as

ds2 = dt2 + dr2 + r2(d2 + sin2 d2) + h(r)(dt + dr)2

where h = 1  b2 = g[2m/r  2(e2 + g2)/r2] in terms of the above results,
and is linear in g. (in these coordinates, gravity looks abelian for this so-
lution.) note that this form (and its abelian nature) closely resembles the
general wave solutions of exercise ixc1.2b (but the cartesian coordinate
x1 is now replaced with r).

a obtain this form from the above forms (where a = b1) by a coordinate

when comparing to the real world, it is useful to know some astrophysical radii:

(1) earths orbit (1 au): 1.5 108 km
(2) solar radius: 7 105 km
(3) earth radius: 6000 km

(4) solar gravitational (schwarzschild) radius (2gm): 3 km

(5) earth gravitational radius: 0.9 cm (1 shoe size).

exercise ixc6.1

consider the following very crude approximations to a star: assume a star has

the density of a hydrogen atom (i.e., of a sphere with the mass of the hydrogen

atom and radius equal to the bohr radius). assume also that the radius of this

(spherical) star is equal to its gravitational radius. (this is roughly a white

dwarf.) find the mass and radius, in terms of both physical constants and

conventional units. do the same assuming the density of a neutron (a sphere

with the mass of a neutron and radius equal to h/m.) (this is roughly a

neutron star.) compare to the mass and radius of the sun.

all experiments (excluding cosmology) are based on the schwarzschild metric.

the rst type of experiment involves gravitational redshift, but unlike the cosmolog-

ical case, the relevant reference frames of observation are not local inertial frames

but the static reference frame in which the schwarzschild metric is dened. (there

are also measurements of redshift from airplanes, whose reference frame is dened

with respect to the schwarzschild one.) in this reference frame the relevant killing
vector is the one which expresses the fact that the space is static, k mm = /t. the
momentum which is measured by the observer is pa, not pm or pm, since the observer
still uses a reference frame for which the metric at his position is at (but not its rst

derivative, since he is not in free fall). (in fact, this is one of the purposes for using

a vierbein, as a frame of reference.) the conserved quantity is then

e = kapa =r1 

2gm

r

frame. thus, conservation of e for a photon gives the r-dependence of the observed

where the energy of a particle be is the time component of pa as measured in this
energy be (and thus the frequency, which in turn determines the wavelength, since

p2 = 0).

608

to compare with nonrelativistic mechanics, we instead evaluate e for a massive

particle in the newtonian limit:

giving the conserved energy e in terms of the particle energy be (rest mass m +

kinetic k), including the potential energy.

the other type of experiment involves properties of geodesics, so we need to
solve the geodesic equations of motion. without loss of generality, we can choose the
angular coordinates such that the initial position and direction of the particle is in the
equatorial plane  = /2, where it remains because of the symmetry     , as in
the nonrelativistic case. also as in the nonrelativistic case, we can nd constants of
the motion corresponding to the energy e and (z-component of) angular momentum

with the same terms as in the newtonian case but with an extra r3 term.
(to
take the nonrelativistic limit for the massive case, rst scale the ane parameter
  s/m.) since there are good coordinate systems for a black hole using r as a
coordinate (e.g., see the following subsection: r and r + t, as seen from the gure
for kruskal-szkeres), this equation can even be used to descibe a fall into a black
hole. (for example, for l = 0 we get the same cycloid solution as in cosmology and
in newtonian gravity, reaching the singularity at r = 0 in nite proper time.)

because of the r3 term in the potential, noncircular orbits are no longer closed.

in the weak-eld approximation. this eect contributes to the measurement of the
precession of the perihelion of the (elliptical) orbit of mercury, but so do the precession
of earths axis, the oblateness of the sun, and gravitational interaction with other
planets. as a result, this relativistic eect contributes less than 1% to the observed
precession. in particular, the solar oblateness is dicult to measure.

the eects on geodesics of photons are much easier to measure, since there are
no newtonian eects. as a result, the weak eld approximation is sucient. we rst
consider bending of light by the sun: a photon comes in from innity and goes back
out to innity (actually to the earth, which we assume is much farther from the sun
than the photons closest approach to it), and we measure what angle its trajectory
was bent by. (for example, we look at the apprarent change of position in stars when
the sun passes in their direction during an eclipse.) starting with the exact solution

7. black holes

for physical massive bodies the schwarzschild solution applies only outside the
body, where tab = 0. the form of the solution inside the body depends on the
distribution of matter, which is determined by its dynamics. generally the surface of
the body is at r  gm, but we can try to nd a solution corresponding to a point
mass by extending the coordinates as far as possible, till the curvature components
cd blow up. the schwarzschild metric is singular at r = 2gm. in fact, r and
rab
t switch their roles as space and time coordinates there. there is no corresponding
singularity there in the curvatures, which are  r3. this unphysical singularity can
be eliminated by rst making the coordinate transformation, for r > 2gm,

r =z dr(cid:18)1 

2gm

r (cid:19)1

= r + 2gm ln(cid:16) r

2gm  1(cid:17)

and then making a second coordinate transformation by rescaling the lightcone
coordinates as

r  t = 4gme(rt)/4gm = 4gmr r

2gm  1 e(rt)/4gm

the result is the kruskal-szekeres coordinates

ds2 =

2gm

r

er/2gm (dt2 + dr2) + r2(d2 + sin2 d2)

where r(r, t) is dened by

r2  t2 = (4gm)2(cid:16) r

2gm  1(cid:17) er/2gm

this can now be extended past r = 2gm down to the physical singularity at r = 0.

the complete space now looks like (plotting just r and t):

in this diagram lines at 45 to the axes represent radial lightlike geodesics. since
nothing travels faster than light, this indicates the allowed paths of physical objects.
curves of xed r are hyperbolas: in particular, the physical singularity is the curve
t2  r2 = (4gm)2 (r = 0), while t2  r2 = 0 (r = 2gm) is the event hori-
zon which allows things to go only one way (out from the bottom half or into the
top half), and r =  is both r = . nothing can communicate between the 2
outside worlds of the left and right 90 wedges.
in particular, a star which col-
lapses (gravitational collapse) inside its gravitational radius 2gm is crushed to
a singularity, and the spherically symmetric approximation to this collapse must be
represented by part of the kruskal-szekeres solution (outside the star) by birkhos
theorem, patched to another solution inside the star representing the contribution
of the matter (energy) there to the eld equations. this means using just the top
and right 90 wedges, with parts near the left edge of this modied appropriately.
the top wedge is called a black hole. (if a situation should exist described by just
the bottom and right wedges, the bottom wedge would be called a white hole.)
similarly, stable stars are described by just the right wedge, patched to some interior
solution. this right wedge represents the original schwarzschild solution in the region
r > 2gm where its coordinates are nonsingular. in that region lines of constant t
are just straight radial lines in the kruskal-szekeres coordinate system (r  t).
besides the fact that nothing can get out, another interesting feature of the black
hole is that an outside observer never sees something falling in actually reach the event
horizon: consider an observer at xed r > 2gm using schwarzschild coordinates,

c. curved spaces

613

so his proper time s  t. then light radiating radially from an in-falling object is
received later and later, up till t = , by the observer as the object approaches the
event horizon, although it takes the object a nite amount of proper time to reach
the event horizon and the physical singularity.

exercise ixc7.1

apply the methods of subsection ixc3 to the equations of motion in a
schwarzschild metric of subsection ixc6 for a massive object falling straight
into a black hole (angular momentum l = 0): solve for r, t,  in an appro-
priate parametrization to show that it takes a nite proper time to reach the
event horizon from any nite r outside it.

there are also more complicated black-hole solutions with spin and electric charge.

another interesting eect of the event horizon is the eventual decay of the black
hole (hawking radiation): pair creation can result in a similar way to that in
an electrostatic potential of sucient strength (see exercise iiib5.1). particles are
emitted near the event horizon (the edge of the gravitational barrier), carrying energy
o to innity, while their antiparticles fall into the singularity.

there are two features of the black hole that are less than desirable: the existence
of singularities indicates a breakdown in the eld equations, and the existence of event
horizons results in an information loss. both these properties might be avoidable
quantum mechanically: for example, quantum eects can generate curvature-squared
terms in the eective action, which modify the short-distance behavior of the theory.
one might think that such short-distance eects would have an eect only at short
distances away from regions of high curvature such as the singularity, and thus remove
the singularities but not the event horizons. however, it is possible (and examples of
such solutions have been given) that the prevention of the creation of the singularity
in stellar collapse would eventually result in a reversal of the collapse (gravitational
bounce): the would-be black hole solution is patched to a would-have-been white
hole by short-distance modications, resulting in an exploding star that initially re-
sembled a black hole but has no true event horizon.

in the previous chapter we studied the symmetry principles behind general rel-
ativity; now we add supersymmetry to the picture. supergravity is a fundamental
part of many of the applications of supersymmetry.

we rst need to understand the geometry associated with local supersymmetry.

1. covariant derivatives

in subsection ivc3 we discussed superspace covariant derivatives for super yang-
mills. similar methods can be applied to supergravity, the theory of the graviton (spin
2) and gravitino (spin 3/2). in that case we want to gauge the complete (unbroken)
global symmetry of the theory: besides the obvious poincare and supersymmetry,
there is also the axial u(1) (r) symmetry that transforms the spin-3/2 eld. (the
best we might have expected is superconformal symmetry, which also has conformal
boosts and scale, but which are broken by the vacuum just as in ordinary gravity,
and s-supersymmetry, which is also broken because its the square root of conformal
boosts.)
it is introduced in the same way as local lorentz invariance in ordinary
gravity, and acts on at spinor indices (but cancels on vector indices). we therefore
want to gauge the translations m (which have been generalized naturally to super-
space from m appearing in ordinary gravity to include supersymmetry), the lorentz

generators m, m .
 of ordinary gravity, and the (second-quantized) hermitian u(1)
generator y , dened to act on the covariant derivatives as

[y,] =  1

[y, .] = 1

[y,a] = 0

 to refer to hermitian conjugation without reordering, i.e., keep-
we now use the 
ing the partial derivatives and other generators on the right. (as in ordinary gravity,
transformations are not truly unitary, and covariant derivatives truly hermitian, be-
cause of ordering.)

then the gauge parameter, covariant derivative, and eld strengths are expanded

over these generators, as in ordinary gravity:

m is known as the supervierbein or vielbein.) alternatively, we can write the

2 k abmba (and similarly for the covariant derivative
and eld strengths), where mab are the generators of osp(3,1|4), by algebraically
constraining k ab to contain just the appropriate pieces (and relating k ab to k  in
the usual way). also, the shorthand k imi now includes lorentz and u(1) terms.

(the rst two constraints imply the generalization of this chirality condition to y 6= 0
and chiral superelds with undotted indices, like the yang-mills eld strength.)

exercise xa1.2

rewrite the rst and last set of constraints directly in terms of eld strengths.

the explicit solution of all these constraints is a bit messy, but we will need
only a certain subset of them to nd the prepotentials and supergravity action. the
form of the solution is a generalization of super yang-mills in a way similar to how
general relativity generalizes ordinary yang-mills. in particular, just as the vierbein
mm is a generalization of the yang-mills vector aa to describe gauging of the
ea = ea
translations, the generalization of the super yang-mills prepotential v to supergravity
is h = h m(i)m, which appears in an exponential eh just as v appears as ev : the
chirality-preserving constraints, expressed explicitly in terms of the vielbein, is

{e, e} = c

if the commutator vanished like the yang-mills case, e would be partial derivatives
on some complex two-dimensional subspace, the usual  up to some complex (su-
per)coordinate transformation, as for d in at superspace. however, the fact that
their algebra still closes means they still generate translations within such a subspace,
and are thus linear combinations of such partial derivatives:

e = ee,

m is the gauge eld for supersymmetry, with contributions from the second and

fourth terms. finally, the fourth term also shows that am is the gauge eld for u(1).
the resulting component content is that of conformal supergravity, which will be
transformed later to ordinary supergravity through a compensator supereld.

for perturbation theory, or comparison with global supersymmetry, we should
expand about at superspace (which is nontrivial because of nonvanishing torsion

again as for yang-mills, the chiral-representation eld  transforms under only the

thus, scalars in the real representation become densities in the chiral representation
(except for y = 0). in particular, we have for the special case

y = 1   = ei



  z dx d2  = 0

which will prove useful later for chiral integration. for now, we note that such a
chiral scalar, with y 6= 0, can be seen to compensate from the  term: this term
allows u m to eat the complex physical scalar and spinor, xing scale, u(1), and
s-supersymmetry, while the complex auxiliary scalar survives, along with coordinate,
lorentz, and supersymmetry invariance. we also note that for perturbation about

i(1

exercise xa1.4

show that preservation of the chirality of  implies the previous chirality con-
ditions on . thus, as for nonsupersymmetric or nongravitational theories,
the gauge group follows more simply from starting with matter representa-
tions.

we also note that in the gauge  = 1, and also  =

nant is simply (see subsection iic3)

e1 = det(em

where em

a is a component of em

2. field strengths

these constraints can be completely solved for all the eld strengths. alterna-
tively, we can impose them, together with the bianchi identities (jacobi identities
of the covariant derivatives), to nd a smaller set of algebraically independent eld
strengths, and the dierential equations that relate them. the method is analogous
to the case of super yang-mills treated in subsection ivc3. we begin with the con-
straints analogous to the yang-mills ones:

3. compensators

just as in ordinary gravity, compensators for scale transformations can be intro-
duced, but for supergravity the compensator should be a supersymmetric multiplet.
the simplest choice is the chiral scalar supereld  considered earlier: its complex
physical scalar (scalar +i pseudoscalar) compensates local scale (the real part) and

624

x. supergravity

u(1) (the imaginary part), its spinor compensates local s-supersymmetry, and its
auxiliary complex scalar appears as one of the auxiliary elds of supergravity.

compensators are much more important in supergravity than in ordinary gravity:
almost any at space action can be coupled to gravity by the minimal coupling
prescription  replacing derivatives with covariant ones, and throwing a factor of
e1 in for the measure. in supergravity this is not the case: as well see in the next
section, we have both integrals over all superspace, which use e1, but also integrals
over chiral superspace (for integrating chiral superelds), which instead use  for the
measure. the minimal coupling procedure is then:
(1) use  (and ) to make a at-superspace action superconformally invariant,
(2) replace the at derivatives da with the curved ones a, and
(3) throw in the measure factors appropriate for the integrals.

(the last two steps couple conformal supergravity to a globally conformally invariant
theory.)

another compensator that is commonly used is the tensor multiplet.

(this
is sometimes confused in the literature with the (complex) linear multiplet, an-
other version of the scalar multiplet with no gauge elds whatsoever.) treated as a
matter multiplet, it has the same physical content as the scalar multiplet, but the
pseudoscalar is replaced with a second-rank antisymmetric tensor gauge eld,

bmn = [mn]

to make things simpler, lets look at at space. we rst note that this tensor is
dual to a pseudoscalar in the sense of switching eld equations and constraints of
the eld strength (see exercises iib2.1 and viiia8.2): for the free elds,

fa = a  [afb] = 0,

ga = 1

2abcdbbcd  aga = 0

with the eld equations following from self-duality under f  g:

fa = ga  afa = [agb] = 0

since the theory of bab must be described in terms of ga alone (because of gauge
invariance), no renormalizable self-interactions are allowed; thus, this eld is of little
interest in quantum eld theory outside of supergravity. in terms of the scalar, the
fact that only the eld strength fa appears in the eld equations means there is the
global symmetry

 = 

a. superspace

625

for constant parameter . this generalizes to the nonabelian symmetries of nonlin-
ear  models, resulting in derivative interactions (again nonrenormalizable) but no
potentials.

exercise xa3.1

consider coupling the tensor eld to yang-mills: to preserve the tensors own
gauge symmetry, this coupling must be nonminimal. to produce such a cou-
pling, we start with the scalar and duality transform. the coupling we choose
is another 4d analog to the 2d model we considered in exercise viiia8.2, re-
placing the pseudoscalar and total derivative 1
8abcdfabfcd).
(in general dimensions, the dual to a scalar is a rank-d2 antisymmetric
tensor.) we start with the lagrangian

2 abfab with tr( 1

l =  1

4   +  1

16tr(abcdfabfcd)

for some coupling constant . making use of the chern-simons form babc of
subsection iiic6 to write  in this action only as a, write a rst-order form
of this action and perform a duality transformation to obtain

l = 1

24eh 2,

ehabc = 1

2[abbc] + babc

find the yang-mills gauge transformation of bab. (hint: eh is gauge invari-

ant.)

the tensor multiplet is described by a chiral spinor gauge eld

 = i d2dk

(k = k)

duality is then described in terms of the real scalar supereld strength (in the free
case)

f =  +   d2df = 0,

g = 1

2(d + d .

.)  d2g = 0


with the eld equation

f = g

(fa appears at order   in g, and bab at order  in .) again the pseudoscalar has
a global symmetry: in terms of the supereld,

 = i

now we return to curved space, covariantizing the above with respect to confor-
mal supergravity. we now identify the above global symmetry with the local axial

626

x. supergravity

u(1) (r-)symmetry of supergravity. thus, the supereld g does not compensate for
this symmetry; it remains as a symmetry in actions that use this compensator. in

particular, there are no r d2 terms in such theories, except those that are locally

superscale invariant (so the compensator decouples). the matter tensor multiplet
also diers from the scalar multiplet in that it has no auxiliary elds (except for the
auxiliary components of the gauge eld).

4. scale gauges

since all the covariant derivatives are built up from the spinor part of the vielbein,
we dene the local superscale transformations for the covariant derivatives by rst
dening

e = le

where l is a real, unconstrained supereld. the constraints then imply

 = l + 2(l)m + 6(l)y,
from the anticommutator we nd

. = l . + 2(

using the commutation relations, we then can show

b = l6(2 + b)l4,

w  = l3[w  12i(2 + b) ln l]

g . = (2[, .] + g .)l2,

w  = l3w

from the way they appear in the commutators we also have that

y ga = 0,

y w = 1

2w,

y w = 1

2w,

y b = b

from linearization, we see that b and w  pick out exactly the two irreducible halves
of the real scalar supereld l: the vector multiplet in w  and the scalar multiplet
in b. (compare the vector multiplet eld strength and chiral scalar gauge xing for
the prepotential v as described in subsections ivc4 and vib9.) this means we can
completely x the superscale gauge by the choice

b = w = 0

as the generalization of the scale gauge in ordinary gravity that xes the ricci scalar
to vanish.

a. superspace

627

exercise xa4.1

derive the superscale transformations by use of the bianchi identities:

a use the commutation relations of the covariant derivatives (and the solution
to the jacobi identities) to nd all the transformations above. show they
imply e = l4e.

b an easier way is to use the reduced bianchi identities: determine the trans-
formations of the reduced eld strengths, up to constants, using chirality,
dimensional analysis, etc., and then solve for the constants by plugging into
the reduced identities.

we then dene the scale (and u(1)) transformations of the compensators:

 = l2,

y  = 1

3;

 . = 0

g = l4g,

y g = 0;

(2 + b)g = 0,

g = g

where the scale weights follow from the u(1) weights (vanishing for g by reality) by
consistency with the constraints they satisfy.

exercise xa4.2

show that a supereld can be chiral only if it has no dotted indices. then
show the relation that any such supereld has between scale and u(1) weights.

all these transformations can be derived either by consistency with the con-
straints, or by using the solution of the constraints: in terms of the unconstrained
superelds that solve the constraints, the superscale transformation is trivial:

 = l,

n

 = n

,

 = 

the net result, as for super yang-mills, is that all the supercial transformations of
the constrained covariant derivatives are completely replaced with the new invariances
that appear upon solving the constraints: k1 and l eliminate , k  kills n
, and
k m reduces m to its real part u m , which transforms only under m .

exercise xa4.3

rederive a as in subsection xa1, but in a general gauge, to nd

ia = et,

et = 2e(1  e



)

show this result gives a superscale transformation for a that agrees with the
result above. show the explicit solution for  in terms of  and t also gives
it a superscale transformation that agrees with the above.

628

x. supergravity

exercise xa4.4

often it is easier to use the solution to the constraints than the jacobi iden-
tities:

a solve for fab in terms of a, and use the solution for a from subsection

xa1, to derive

w = i(

2

+ b)(t + t )

and use this to rederive the superscale transformation above. (hint: dene
and use the chiral representation.)

b find an explicit expression for b, and use it to rederive its superscale trans-
 rst. since b is a scalar, you

formation. (hint: you will need to nd 
can choose the lorentz gauge n

 = 

.)

in subsection xa1 we found that a convenient way to simultaneously x lorentz,
u(1), and scale gauges was to choose e = e. (however, the corresponding com-
ponent invariances reappeared in the chiral gauge invariances.) compensators allow
more freedom for gauge xing: for example, we can x the gauge b = w = 0 as
described above, or we can x to 1 the compensator or a physical matter multiplet
(string gauge, as for gravity in subsection ixb5): the possibility of gauges such as
 = 1 or g = 1 depends on the existence in the action of such elds, and not on the
details of how they appear (as long as the gauge choice is consistent with the allowed
vacuum values). in particular, it does not depend on the signs of their kinetic terms,
which is the only thing that determines what is physical and what is a compensator.

note that either  = 1 or g = 1 completely xes the superscale gauge, in spite
of the constraints on these superelds. (e.g,  =  = 1  l = 1.) this is due to
the appearance of the u(1) connection: for example, before xing the scale and u(1)
gauges the chirality condition on , rather than constraining , actually determines
the spinor u(1) connection a:
  = (e  i 1

3a)  = 0  a = 3ie ln 

(but the chirality of the ratio of two chiral superelds with the same weights really
xes it to be chiral;
in other words, chirality of scalars makes all but one truly
chiral, since the u(1) connection can be determined only once.) as a result, the
scale (  = 1) and u(1) (/  = 1) gauge choice  = 1 determines w:

similarly,

 = 1  a = 0  w = 0

g = 1  0 = (2 + b)g = b

a. superspace

629

conversely, we see that whenever one of the two eld strengths b and w  is elim-
inated by a superscale(/u(1)) gauge choice in terms of one of the two compensators
 and g, the other eld strength can be made superscale invariant: if we introduce
the compensator by a superscale transformation (as for gravity in subsection ixa7),
substituting either

in the above transformation laws, we nd

l4   or g

b = ( )3/2(

2

fw = g3/4[w + 3i(

+ b)  = 1/2 3/2(
+ b)ln g]

2

2

+ b) 

as locally superscale invariant, where using  for fw or g for b yields zero. we

can therefore interpret gauging away the compensators as gauging them into the eld
strengths: we have a choice of either

 = 1  w = 0,
g = 1  b = 0,

b = b

fw = w

this is analogous to stuckelberg gauges (and their nonlinear generalizations): one of
these two tensors (gauge elds with respect to superscale) eats the compensator.
however, it diers from stuckelberg in that a second gauge eld is completely
gauged away.

in fact, well see in the next section that the pure supergravity actions constructed
using either of these compensators gives the corresponding eld strength as its eld
equation:


  b = 0

  fw = 0

thus, either compensator can be used to eliminate both b and w, one as a eld
equation and the other as a gauge choice. this result is already clear at this point
from dimensional analysis and chirality; similarly, we must have


u m  ga = 0

where ga is the result of applying a superscale transformation to ga with whichever
of the two compensators is being used in the action. this leaves w as the on-shell
eld strength. the analogy to ordinary gravity is

(r, rab  1

2 abr, wabcd)  (b/w, ga, w)

630

x. supergravity

although the ricci tensor must appear in ga, superscale invariance allows the
choice of gauges where the  = 0 component is arbitrary: from the above we nd the
linearized transformations

g .  4[, .]l,

a .  6[, .]l

(for purposes of evaluating at  = 0 we can neglect a| in aa.) thus, this axial vec-
tor component eld can be moved around as convenient for component expansions. in
ga, they appear only in their invariant combination, ga + 2
3 aa in this approximation.
in nonsupersymmetric gauges, we can even gauge ga| = 0.

exercise xa4.5

use the bianchi identities instead of explicit superscale to track down the
axial vector:

a use the relation of w (which is scale covariant) to w (the eld strength
3aa that appears

for aa) and ga to show that it is just this combination ga + 2
in w (as its curl, for u(1) invariance).

b show that

g = 1  b = 0  aga = 0

thus, in this gauge the axial vector gauge eld aa has been gauged out of
ga| (although its eld strength may appear at higher order: the gauge g = 1
doesnt x u(1)). what replaces it? (hint: whats in g?)

now that we understand the structure of superelds in curved superspace, we an-
alyze various supergravity theories through their actions. we will use several methods
for nding and evaluating supergravity actions. these actions are signicantly more
complicated than those we have encountered previously, and it is dicult to see all
their features simultaneously, so for any particular application we use the method
which best simplies the property we most need:

(1) superspace methods are the best for nding general actions and their symmetry
properties, manifesting supersymmetry, using globally supersymmetric gauges,
and performing quantum calculations.

(2) component methods are useful for comparing actions and other properties to
nonsupersymmetric theories. such approaches sometimes make some use of su-
perspace, but not superspace integration.

(3) compensators are useful in conjunction with either of these methods, and can
extract many important features and terms in the action with little more than
the results of global supersymmetry. they reveal useful broken symmetries, and
are the simplest way to analyze the superhiggs eect (higgs for local supersym-
metry).

1. integration

the action for supergravity follows from dimensional analysis: since the usual

einstein-hilbert lagrangian has dimension +2, as does r d4, the superspace la-

grangian must be dimensionless. the only covariant possibility in terms of the po-
tentials (ea

m and a

i) is thus

ssg = 3z dx d4 e1

including a normalization factor that will prove convenient later.
introducing the
compensator and local scale invariance must also make the usual action for super-
gravity look like the kinetic term for the compensator multiplet, i.e.,

ssg,c = 3z dx d4 e1 

(for simplicity we will restrict ourselves for the most part to the simplest compensator,
the chiral scalar.) the previous form then corresponds to the scale gauge  = 1;
often the scale + u(1) gauge  = 1 is more convenient.

b. actions

633

there should also be a supersymmetrization of the cosmological term. this might
seem dicult, requiring explicit prepotentials. however, we know from our study
of de sitter space that the cosmological term is basically a statement about the
conformal compensator. therefore, the cosmological term for supergravity, in terms
of the superconformal compensator , should be the supersymmetrization of the
corresponding term in ordinary gravity, a dimensionless self-interaction for a scalar.
the solution of the chirality condition can be written as

y 3 = 3  3 = 3e



e

in the gauge  = 1. the result for the cosmological term is then

sscosmo =z dx d2 e13 + h.c. =z dx d2 3 + h.c.

independent of scale or u(1) gauge: as we saw in subsection xa1, this expression is
invariant under  transformations, and the integrand itself is invariant under k and
l transformations.

exercise xb1.1

although this nal result for the cosmological term in terms of  is locally
superscale invariant, the derivation started in the gauge  = 1. generalize
the derivation, and the result in terms of , to arbitrary gauges (see exercise
xa4.3).

a chiral expression for ssg can be found by similar methods:

ssg = 3z dx d2 e1b = 3z dx d2  e1 b

thus, as for super yang-mills, the action can be expressed as a real, chiral, or an-
tichiral integral. with the compensator,

or, more generally,

ssg = 3z dx d2 e1(
z dx d4 e1l =z dx d2 e1(

+ b)  = 3z dx d2  e1 (2 + b)
+ b)l =z dx d2  e1(2 + b)l

2

which is just the naive covariantization of the at-space result (at least in the gauge
 = 1: see exercise xb1.1). clearly this method generalizes to coupling to other

multiplets, and allows bothr d2 andr d4 integrals to be generalized to curved su-

perspace. in fact, the analysis of the compensator is much simpler than that of the
conformal supergravity that couples to it to produce ordinary supergravity: just as

634

x. supergravity

in ordinary gravity, where use of just the compensator allowed us to study certain in-
teresting solutions in gravity, namely de sitter space and cosomology, some properties
of supergravity can be analyzed in terms of just the compensator.

a simple expression (as simple as the super yang-mills case) can be written for
the supergravity action in terms of unconstrained superelds. we rst give a rst-
order action, analogous to the one for yang-mills (subsection ivc5): in that case the
action was in terms of v and aa; here it is in terms of u m and em

constraints solved in subsection xa1, we write the action as

the expansion of the superspace action in terms of unconstrained superelds is
needed for supergraphs, the most ecient way to do quantum calculations. we will
not consider quantization here; the methods are similar to those described in subsec-
tions vib5, 9-10, and c5 for super yang-mills. in particular, one uses background
eld methods: for example, as for super yang-mills,

although all supersymmetric theories can be analyzed directly in superspace (in-
cluding classical solutions, eective potentials, feynman graphs, etc.), for comparison
to nonsupersymmetric theories it is necessary to expand superelds in components.
since all fundamental theories are described by actions, it is sucient to give a pre-
scription for evaluating any action in terms of component elds, as in subsection ivc2
for global supersymmetry. in locally supersymmetric theories, the vielbein needs to
be expanded in terms of the prepotentials for supergraphs. we can also nd compo-
nent actions by a straightforward taylor expansion in  of the prepotentials in the
superspace action. however, for component expansions of classical actions, one can
get by more simply by applying bianchi identities to the covariant derivatives and
dierential forms (antisymmetric tensors). it is unnecessary to know even the explicit
form of the measure in terms of the vielbein or prepotentials.

the fundamental idea is to think of the lagrangian not as a scalar times a mea-
sure, but more geometrically as an antisymmetric tensor. although this approach
does not work for the usual superspace lagrangians because of the peculiarities of
fermionic integration, it can be applied to component lagrangians integrated over
4d spacetime, treated as the bosonic subspace of superspace. we thus write the
component action as

s = 1

4!z dxmdxndxpdxq lmnpq(x, )

where lm n p q is a graded antisymmetric supereld. of course, the action should be
independent of , even though we have integrated over only x. this is equivalent to
requiring that the integral should be independent of the choice of 4d hypersurface in
superspace. we are familiar with a similar requirement for conserved charges, which
are dened as integrals over 3d hypersurfaces: treating the conserved current in
terms of the 3-form dual to the vector,

jmnp = gmnpqj q  q = 1

3!z dxmdxndxpjmnp

636

x. supergravity

the dual to the usual conservation law as vanishing (covariant) divergence of the
vector is vanishing curl of the 3-form:

d
dt

q = 0  [mjnpq] = 0

an important point is that neither the denition of the charge nor the conservation
law requires a metric, since integration in general does not. we thus require for our
supersymmetric action




s = 0  [m ln p qr) = 0,

lm n p q = 1

3! [m n p q)

where the gauge invariance allows us to drop terms in the lagrangian that are total
derivatives (surface terms). note that both l and  are assumed to be local func-
tions of the elds and their (nite-order) derivatives. (as a result, this is not the
usual cohomology, where both would be allowed to be arbitrary functions of the
coordinates.)

converting the curl-free condition to at indices (see subsection ivc5 for the

chern-simons superform),

the next step is to explicitly solve the curl-free condition on the 4-form in terms
of the usual scalar superspace lagrangian. (an alternative is to solve the bianchis for
the eld strength of the 3-form gauge eld, which is also a 4-form.) the procedure
is the same as that used to solve the bianchi identities for covariant derivatives (in
subsection xa2): we start with the lowest-dimension equations and work up. the
equations that include the constant (vacuum/at-space) part of the torsion can be
solved algebraically, the rest give dierential constraints. of course, we will need to
use the results of subsection xa2 for the torsions and their constraints. the result is

the result is thus the component expansion of the usual curved superspace action

s =z dx d2 e1l + h.c.

using the bianchi identities of the covariant derivatives one can also covariantize the
usual solution to the chirality condition:

l = (
which allows us to identify the action as

s =z dx d4 e1(l + l)

so l can be taken real without loss of generality for general d4 integrals. on the

components of a supereld are again dened by evaluating its covariant deriva-
tives at  = 0. however, as in the case of global supersymmetry, the value of  is
arbitrary, since the result for the action is  independent: we therefore will gener-
ally drop the |  in component expansions of actions; any supereld then implicitly
refers to the corresponding component. this  independence also means that it is
not necessary to make any gauge choices: these methods automatically express the
action in terms of just the component elds that cannot be completely gauged away.

3. component transformations

we saw in the previous subsection that in component expansions the supergravity
a, since by denition we restrict to the bosonic
gauge elds naturally appear as em
submanifold. similar remarks apply to the component form of their supercoordinate
transformations (i.e., local supersymmetry), and the related component expansion
of their eld strengths: in subsection ixb4, we saw that coordinate transformations
a because the
(as applied to solving the radial gauge condition) were simpler for em
derivative term on the parameter was just m k a.

we therefore begin by rewriting the gauge (coordinate) transformations in terms
a. as for gravity (see subsections ixa2 and ixb4), we can choose to make the
of em
transformation laws more manifestly covariant by writing the generators in terms of
covariant derivatives. then, as for gravity,

the application of these identities is similar to that for expansion of the action in
a into bosonic and fermionic
the previous section: the separation of the factors of em
parts yields an expansion in powers of the gravitino eld. for the torsion case where
the index a = a we solve for mab in terms of the torsions (auxiliary elds and
, used for the
constants) and vielbein; for the torsion case a =  we solve for tab
transformation law of the auxiliary elds, and for the curvature case we solve for
cd, used in the component expansion of the action, in terms of these auxiliaries,
rab
the vielbein, and the just-determined connection. the u(1) connection am needs no
solution: it is pure (superscale) gauge, and will cancel in actions (after perhaps an
appropriate redenition of ga). for these manipulations we use the relations that
cd have to b, ga, w, w, and their derivatives (as expressed by the

4. component approach

we can now take the superspace action of subsection xb1, as expanded in com-
ponents by the ectoplasm method of subsection xb2, and substitute the component
expansions of the eld strengths found in subsection xb3, to nd the component
action

8 (ga)2 + 3 bb

(note the signs are again consistent with ga and b, b forming a 6-vector of so(3,3),
though not in the same way as in exercise xa2.6.) here  and lg are the usual
covariant derivative and einstein-hilbert action of general relativity in terms of e
and , but  is slightly dierent from any of the connections used previously (see
exercise xb4.1 below). it also diers from the  given above in that we have explicitly
extracted the ga piece (which is the sole source of  in the ectoplasm approach). an
alternative to ectoplasm to determine  is to use a rst-order formalism: rather
than imposing the usual torsion constraint, we can leave the lorentz connection as
an independent eld in r and in the  in l. eliminating the lorentz connection
by its eld equation yields a modied torsion constraint, and produces 4 terms in
the action. we have written l in a form manifestly symmetric with respect to
integration by parts. (alternatively, we can write e  e .)

as an alternative to deriving the component action from the simpler superspace
expression, we can postulate the component action directly. in the component ap-
proach writing the action in components is more direct than the superspace approach
by denition, but proving supersymmetry invariance is less so. this is not so true
when coupling to matter, where writing component actions can also be as compli-
cated as deriving them from superspace, so here we consider the simplest case, pure
supergravity. we thus begin by postulating lsg = lg + l; the rst term is obvious,
while the second follows from minimal coupling for the free gravitino action, which can
be derived easily by many methods (see, e.g., subsection xiia5 below). we ignore
the auxiliary elds, which are necessary for o-shell closure of the supersymmetry
algebra, but not for supersymmetry invariance of the action.

we write the action for gravity in a form that more resembles the gravitino action

where we have switched to spinor notation for the curvature (see subsection ixa1) and
used duality in both vector and spinor notation (see subsection iia7). (alternatively,
we can regard this as the denition of the gravity action.) we then have for the
variation of this part of the action (after some integration by parts)

lg = i 1

where we have integrated by parts to free the supersymmetry parameters of deriva-

2{e, r}  1

the curvature terms then cancel those from lg, if we choose for e in lg the

transformation law

then we also substitute this expression for e in l, and note that half those terms
immediately drop out, since

we now note that the former factor in lsg vanishes by virtue of the equation of
motion from varying the connection: rather than vanishing, the torsion now satises

second  order :

 . = 0

etmn

we can regard et as the supersymmetrized torsion; this is equivalent on shell to the

result we found in the previous subsection from superspace. we can therefore quit
now, since in a second-order formalism the torsion (and thus the lorentz connection)
would satisfy this equation even o shell. (this approach, using the second-order
formalism but not bothering to substitute the supersymmetry variation of the con-
nection, is called the 1.5-order formalism.) on the other hand, we can just as easily
recognize that in the rst-order formalism cancelation of lsg is also guaranteed by
allowing vanishing of the latter factor to dene the supersymmetry variation of the
(independent) connection:

f irst  order : pq . = 0

thus, use of the rst-order formalism requires no more work than 1.5-order (contrary
to remarks in the literature), which is really the same as second-order, and provides
the bonus of yielding the transformation law for . however, it is useful to note that
not all quantities should have their longer forms substituted at the beginning of a
calculation (just as we learned in high-school algebra not to plug in numbers till the
end).

exercise xb4.1

lets complete this calculation to the bitter end, nding all the properties of
the connection:

a solve the torsion constraint for  (see subsection ixa3).

b find the transformation law for  that follows from cancelation of the above

terms o shell (i.e., without imposing the torsion constraint).

c show the above two results are consistent (modulo terms with  eld equa-
tions, which can be canceled by contributions from auxiliary elds) by plug-
ging the expressions for e and  into the variation of the result for part a
and comparing with the result for part b.

d compare these results with the connection found in the previous subsection.

how does the appearance of ga aect the transformation law?

5. duality

although antisymmetric tensor gauge elds can be avoided in general, they tend
to turn up in string theory, so we now look at them a little more generally, examining
their actions and how they relate to those for scalars. in particular, we note that
a sensible action for such a tensor alone cannot be constructed that is conformally
invariant: from the same analysis as for electromagnetism or yang-mills (subsection
ixa7), we see that (fa)2 does not give a scale-invariant action in four dimensions.
thus, such a eld is not suitable as a compensator for pure gravity. however, in
supergravity the tensor multiplet (see subsection xa3) also has an ordinary scalar,
and an appropriate power of it can make the tensors action conformal. therefore,
we now examine general duality transformations for the supersymmetric case, which
is more relevant for understanding its use in gravity. we will consider explicitly a
at superspace background for simplicity, but generalization to curved superspace
by covariantization is straightforward, replacing at superspace derivatives with (su-
perconformal) covariant derivatives, introducing supergravity eld strengths where
necessary (in this case, just d2  
+ b for chirality), and using the covariant
integration measures.

2

duality transformations can be performed directly in the action by use of rst-

order formulations. starting with the general tensor multiplet action

where k is some function and g = d + h.c., we write this in rst-order form as

stm =z dx d4 k(g)
stm =z dx d4 [ek(v ) + v g]

where v is an unconstrained real supereld and ek is the legendre transform of k:

for this action to reduce to the previous upon applying the algebraic eld equation
of v , we must have

= k(g)

the duality transformation is then performed by varying  instead of v in sg:
remembering that  is chiral, so

[ek(v ) + v g]|  k(v )

v =g

z d4x d4 v g = 1

2z d4x d2 () d2dv + h.c.

we solve the condition on v as

d2dv = 0  v =  + 

644

x. supergravity

since thinking of v as the prepotential for a vector multiplet says that it is pure
gauge. the dualized action is then

we can also reverse the procedure through another rst-order action

s =z dx d4 ek( + )
s =z dx d4 [k(v )  v ( + )]

where in this case varying with respect to  implies

d2v = 0  v = g

while varying with respect to v gives the inverse legendre transform

[k(v )  v ( + )]| k(v )

v =+  = ek( + )

2 g2: we then nd

the simplest case is the lagrangian 1

so the duality is

k(v ) = 1

ltm = 1

2 v 2

2v 2  ek(v ) =  1
2 g2  l =  1

2( + )2

in at space, this gives the usual free result l =  , but in curved space the
 1
2 2 + h.c. part does not vanish because e1 is not chiral. consequently, this action
is not the conformal one (as we already knew from the component argument above).
however, the conformal one is easy to nd by starting with  : making the eld
redenition   e expresses the action in terms of  + . legendre transforming,

so the duality is

ek(v ) = ev  k(v ) = v (ln v  1)
l = e+   ltm = g(ln g  1)

these two conformal actions for matter, when coupled to conformal supergravity,
become the two minimal actions for supergravity, when the overall sign is changed
to make the matter elds into compensators: the version with  as the compensator
is called old minimal, while that with  is called new minimal. they dier only
o-shell, in their choice of auxiliary elds. note that the eld equations for the two
conformal multiplets,

described in subsection xa4. again, the full expressions follow from the usual su-

compensator dependence is enough to identify them as the appropriate covariantiza-
tions.

which is the only possibility that preserves the gauge invariances of both g and b
while leaving them both auxiliary. (their eld equations are that their eld strengths
vanish.)

6. superhiggs

supergravity aects spontaneous supersymmetry breaking in a simple way: from
the discussion of the immediately preceding subsections, we know that supergravity
can be described more simply as conformal supergravity coupled to a compensator.
simple (n=1) conformal supergravity contains no scalars: it consists of only confor-
mal gravity (the traceless part of the metric), the conformal (traceless) part of the
gravitino eld, and an auxiliary gauge vector. since symmetry breaking involves giv-
ing vacuum values to only scalars, we can replace supergravity by just its compensator
for these purposes.

for a general analysis, consider a kinetic term

sk =z dx d4 3 ek(i, i)/3

(the exponential form will prove convenient for later component analysis.) this is
the most general kinetic term with the usual number of spacetime derivatives: any
term of the form f (, , i, i) can be rewritten in this form after appropriate eld
redenitions. in particular, if we start with elds with arbitrary weyl scale weight,
then this form follows after rescaling elds so only  carries scale weight, since all
terms in the lagrangian must have the same scale weight, xed by (super)conformal
invariance.  is then the only eld to carry u(1) weight, which is proportional to
scale weight by superconformal invariance. then  appears only as , while k is an
arbitrary function of i and i. the rst step in evaluating this action in components
is to simply ignore conformal supergravity altogether, and evaluate this action as is,
in terms of matter and compensator multiplets, by the methods we have considered
previously for evaluating  integration. the next step is to add back in some parts
of conformal supergravity:

b. actions

647

(1) the conformal graviton, which can be put back in easily and uniquely using coor-

dinate and local scale invariance;

(2) the u(1) axial gauge vector, whose coupling is minimal, and thus follows directly

from u(1) covariantizing the spacetime derivatives; and

(3) the conformal gravitino, whose quartic couplings can be quite complicated, but as
a practical matter we are interested in only the mass term, which is determined
from the mass of the goldstone fermion it eats, which appears in the compensator
(and the kinetic term, which is the usual one).

before considering the general case, we look at the pure supergravity case under

this analysis: looking at just the bosons, we nd

ssg,b =z dx e1 1

2{3[(  i 1

3 a) ]  [( + i 1

3a)]  1

2

r + 6 bb}

where  is the usual covariant derivative of general relativity, a is the u(1) gauge
vector, and the relative coecient of the r term was xed by local scale invariance
(see subsection ixa7). note that here b is the usual auxiliary eld from , and is
not associated with conformal supergravity. choosing the component u(1) and scale
gauges | = 1, this reduces to

ssg,b z dx e1( 1

4 r  1

6a2 + 3 bb)

relating to ga, we recall that if we had included it from conformal supergravity,
ga. thus, the
for this compensator ga = ga + 2
compensator method immediately yields the bosonic action, including auxiliary elds.
returning to the general case, the part of the action for the physical scalars (|

3 aa, so we can identify aa with 3

2

and |) then starts out as

2{3[(  i 1
3 a) ]  (ik)i + [(i

sk,ps =z dx e1ek/3 1
3a)]  ( ik) i
r}
+[(  i 1
ignoring until the following subsection the auxiliary scalars, which are irrelevant for
the kinetic term. we use the notation i = /i, i = / i. we then choose the
u(1) and scale gauges

jk)  1

3a)] + [( + i 1

3(ik)( jk)]( j)  (i)  1

2

| = ek(i|, i|)/6

where we have explicitly written the |s to emphasize that this is a nonsupersymmetric
gauge choice for the component |. finally, we eliminate a by its algebraic eld
equation. we thus obtain

sk,ps z dx e1 1

2[(i jk)( j)  (i)  1

2r]

648

x. supergravity

except for the r term and covariant derivatives, this is what would follow in at

superspace from the action r dx d4 k. for supersymmetry breaking, we also need

the super cosmological term

sc =z dx d2 3 + h.c.

for some constant . we could consider more general potentials 3ef (i) (again the
power of  is xed by scale and u(1)), but then the eld redenition   ef /3
would remove it while replacing k  k + f + f . (this invariance, and the form of
the metric on the space of elds  and  appearing in the action, identify k as a

kahler potential.)

the analysis for sk can also be made by performing a duality transformation on
the compensator. following the same steps as described in the previous subsection for
the case without matter (factoring the overall 3 out of the process for convenience),
we nd

sk  z dx d4 [3g ln g + gk(, )]

since in this form a decouples, the result is obvious from the at-space result.

exercise xb6.1

repeat the above analysis using the compensator g: evaluate explicitly all

the contributions from the bosons in g, couple a, nd the r term, show the

result is the same.

normally any kind of symmetry breaking will generate a cosmological term, since

a scalar getting a vacuum value implies the potential itself getting one, giving a term

r dx e1constant. this would require adding a cosmological term to the action by

hand to cancel the generated one, since within observational limits no cosmological

constant is observed in nature. (in any case, the constant generated would corre-

spond to a subatomic length scale, whereas a realistic cosmological constant requires
a cosmological length scale, which means a constant, going as 1/length2, of the order
of 1080 in subatomic units.) an exception is when the potential is at in some direc-
tion: in supersymmetry energy is always positive, and the supersymmetric vacuum

has zero energy, but some potentials allow other, perhaps nonsupersymmetric, vacuua

that also have zero energy, and thus generate no cosmological constant. this avoids

the ad hoc procedure of ne tuning the cosmological constant of an added term for
exact cancelation (or at least to order 1080).

7. no-scale

a useful example of the superhiggs eect with a at potential is no-scale super-
gravity. this theory has an explicit super-cosmological term, but the kinetic term
is such that this term does not generate a component cosmological term, but does
spontaneously break supersymmetry. the simplest example describes supergravity
coupled to a single chiral scalar multiplet. the kinetic term has an su(1,1) symme-
try, and also appears in n=4 supergravity (see subsection xc6 below). written in
terms of just the compensator part of supergravity, it is

sk =z dx d4 3(  + )

1

1

0

0

where  is the compensator and  is the matter. we have written it in a manifestly

u(1,1) covariant form, where the u(1,1) metric is o-diagonal ((cid:0) 0
usual diagonalized(cid:0) 1

1(cid:1)). for the above component analysis we redene
    sk z dx d4 3 (  + )  k = 3 ln(  + )

0(cid:1) instead of the

(many other supereld redenitions are possible to put this in more conventional
forms, such as (3  ), (3 ), etc.) the kinetic term for the physical scalars
follows from the same analysis we applied to the cp(1) model in subsection iva2.
the only dierences here are: (1) the symmetry is u(1,1), not u(2), and (2) the
constraint on the norm of the complex 2-vector follows not from a lagrange multipler
(or a low-energy limit), but as a local scale gauge chosen to give the einstein-hilbert
curvature term the usual normalization. alternatively, we can use the analysis given
in the previous subsection for the general case to nd

sk,ps z dx e1 1

2r(cid:21)
2(cid:20)3 ||2
(  + )2  1

however, to study just the supersymmetry breaking, we want to look at the po-
tential terms: terms that involve the auxiliary scalars instead of spacetime deriva-
tives. we thus now need to include the super cosmological term, which breaks the
su(1,1) invariance. again evaluating at rst without conformal supergravity, then
putting some (all but the conformal gravitino) back in, we nd the contributions from
sk and sc

saux =z dx e13[ bb(  + ) + ( bb + b b) + (b2 + b 2)]

where b = d2 and b = d2. we then see that eliminating the auxiliaries gives
nothing, so there is no potential to generate a cosmological term. however, there is
still a mass term for the gravitino: as always, sc also contains the spinor term

6( 2 + h.c.)

650

x. supergravity

where  = d is the trace of the gravitino. the gravitino in this model therefore
has a mass proportional to h  + i1/2.

exercise xb6.1

explicitly evaluate the spinor part of the kinetic term, and thus determine
the exact value of the mass of the spinor, and thus the gravitino.

su(1,1) invariant kinetic terms also appear in superstring theory, but unlike n=4
and no-scale supergravity, the kinetic term is (  + )1/3 instead of just  + .
(see subsection xib6.) when applying no-scale supergravity to nature, more matter
multiplets are added,

s =z dx d4 3(  +   ii) +(cid:18)z dx d2 3ef (i/) + h.c.(cid:19)

generalizing su(1,1) to su(n,1) in the rst term. (n=5 supergravity has such an
su(5,1) symmetry; see below.) then  acts as the hidden matter sector that doesnt
directly couple to the observed matter i, but serves only to break supersymmetry.

a convenient method for describing extended supersymmetry in d=4 is to ap-
ply dimensional reduction to supersymmetry in d>4, since (1) spinors are bigger in
d>4, so even simple supersymmetry reduces to extended supersymmetry, and (2) the
lorentz group is bigger in d>4, so some 4d scalars arise as parts of higher-d vectors,
etc., meaning fewer lorentz representations in the multiplet in d>4.

1. dirac spinors

we saw in subsection ic1 that coordinate representations of orthogonal groups

so(d) could be dened in terms of self-conjugate fermions,

gab = 1

2[a, b],

{a, b} = ab

we now will construct explicit matrix representations of the dirac matrices for arbi-
trary d, and examine their properties. this is useful for understanding:

(1) representations of internal symmetries, such as in grand unied theories;

(2) theories in higher dimensions, which give simpler formulations of certain four-
dimensional theories when the extra dimensions are eliminated, and appear in
string theory; and

(3) properties of spinors that are independent of d, or their dependence on d, which

is useful for comparison and for perturbation in quantum eld theory.

an explicit solution can be found easily by rst looking at even dimensions, and
breaking up the problem into d/2=n two-dimensional problems. furthermore, we can
look rst at the euclidean case (so(d)), and solve for the other cases (so(d+,d))
by wick rotation. the solution for so(2) is just two of the pauli  matrices. the
general solution then comes from the direct product of the two-dimensional cases,
using the third  matrix to introduce appropriate klein factors (see exercise ia2.3)
to insure that the  matrices from one two-dimensional subspace anticommute with
those from another. the resulting  matrices are then:

1
2

(23     

23 

2i  i      i),

1
2

(23     

23)

where i = 1, 2, there are a total of n factors, and the number of 23 and i factors
in the rst expression ranges from 0 to n1. the last matrix can always be included
to extend so(2n) to so(2n+1); in fact, up to normalization, its simply the product

c. higher dimensions

653

of all the other s. (in other words, the product of all the  matrices is proportional
to the identity.)

exercise xc1.1

apply exercise ic1.2 to this construction: show how this representation re-
lates simply to creation and annihilation operators. show that these klein
factors are identical to those of exercise ia2.3.

the next step is to notice that this construction generally gives a reducible rep-
resentation. reducibility comes from two properties: (1) for so(2n) we really have
so(2n+1); and (2) the representation may be real.
in fact, most of the interest-
ing cases involve so(2n) (in particular, so(3,1) for lorentz and so(4,2) for confor-
mal in four dimensions). in that case we can call the rst (or any other)  matrix
(1  i      i) for so(2n+1) 1, and take the rest as those for so(2n). then
the projection operators

 = 1

2(1 

21)  

2 = , + = + = 0, + +  = 1

commute with the so(2n) generators gab  , so they can be used to project the
representation of the s into two representations of so(2n). these two halves of
a dirac spinor are known as weyl spinors. a convenient representation of the 
matrices for this purpose is the one given in subsection iia6, with the representation
of the pauli matrices used in our su(2)/sl(2,c) discussion of subsections iia1 and
5,

1 = 12(cid:0) 1

we then can write the spinor, which has 2n components (since it represents the direct
product of n representations of  matrices, each of which has two components) as
two 2n1-component spinors projected by

 =   i  ...  i,

the  matrices then take the block-diagonal form

of any orthogonal group are also dening representations of another group: for less
than seven dimensions, this leads to the identication of covering groups discussed in
subsection ic5; for more than six dimensions, it only identies the orthogonal group
as a subgroup of this new group. (an interesting exception is so(8), where the spinor
representations are also 8-dimensional, and are the two other dening representations
of so(8).) in matrix notation, we look for a matrix c =  or  such that we can
dene the operation of charge conjugation as

  c1 *, g  c1(g )*  g = c1g*c

if we like, we can also choose

c = c = c1

without loss of generality. for a representation to be invariant under charge conju-
gation (i.e., real)

 = c1 *  c* = c1

for our  matrix representation, the matrix to look at is

c = ...  c223  c2  c223  c2

where

c2 =(cid:0) 0

i i

0(cid:1)

independent of the representation used for the pauli matrices. (our representation is
simplest, since then c223 = i, and c = c. in other representations, c may also
need an n-dependent factor of i if we want c = c.) using properties of  matrices
we found in our discussion of so(3) in subsection iia2, such as c2*c2 = , we
nd

c1*c = (1)n, c* = (1)n(n+1)/2c1, c t = (1)n(n+1)/2c, c = c1

this distinguishes 8 cases, where the irreducible spinors are:

so(8m):
so(8m+1):
so(8m+2):
so(8m+3):
so(8m+4):
so(8m+5):

spinor consists of two irreducible spinors that are complex conjugate representations
of each other. in general, a dirac spinor has 2n complex components for so(2n) and

where applicable. (pseudoreality does nothing.)

it is useful to know the other group metrics, if they exist. for unitarity properties

we look for a metric 

.
ab such that

g =  1g   =  
(thus g = eg satises  g1 = g .) we can also choose

 =  1

without loss of generality. we therefore look for a metric satisfying

 1 = 

so g  [, ] is antihermitian with respect to  . for so(d), we have simply

 = i

since the hermiticity of the  matrices implies that of the  matrices. we then can also
dene a metric to raise and lower indices in terms of these two metrics, by contracting
the dotted (or undotted) indices: in matrix notation, we then have

(c t  )1t (c t  ) = (1)n  g = (c t  )1gt (c t  )

for all cases except so(4m), this also denes the symmetry properties of the gener-
alized  matrices: they can be dened as c t   for so(2n+1), and as its diagonal
blocks with respect to  for so(4m+2); but for so(4m) its o-diagonal, so the
generalized  matrices appearing there carry one each of the two dierent kinds of
spinor indices, and thus have no symmetry. then we rewrite the above result as

(c t  )t = (1)n(n1)/2(c t  )

2. wick rotation

the indenite-metric groups so(d+,d) (d+ 6= 0 6= d) can be treated by
wick rotation: giving is to d of the as, so the corresponding components of

656

x. supergravity

ab get minus signs. since this aects t in the same way as , the metric c t  is
unchanged. in other words,

c t  = c t
e

(e = i)

in terms of the euclidean c of the previous subsection. however, * and  are
aected in the opposite way to  and t (is instead of is).  then becomes (up
to normalization) the product of the timelike s,
2a

  yaa<0

which also determines the modication of c. in the above equations for  and t ,
we then nd a factor of 1 for each rotated dimension, coming from anticommutation
with each timelike  in  , so we redene all s by an overall factor of id to preserve
their pseudohermiticity. this changes the normalization to

gab = (1)d 1

2[a, b],

{a, b} = (1)dab

in odd dimensions the  matrices are the  matrices (up to multiplication by one
of the metrics), while in even dimensions the  matrices consist of two o-diagonal
blocks of the  matrices. to write actions we also need the dual dirac spinor, in
the sense of a hilbert-space inner product,

 =  

with  as dened above. in particular, it is just 20 in d = 1.

we then nd (e.g., using the explicit representation given above) that c has the
same properties with regard to symmetry and 1 for so(d+,d) as for so(d+  1,
d  1). thus, the properties of these metrics on the irreducible (as opposed to
dirac) spinors follow easily from the euclidean case by using

c t  :

c :

so(d+, d)  so(d+ + d)
so(d+, d)  so(d+  d)

then the properties of  follow from the above two in the cases where all 3 exist;
the few cases where only  exists, which have d even, follow from the next higher d
(increasing d+ by 1).

the vectors of so(d+,d) for 3 d+ + d 6 were expressed as tensors
with two spinor indices, with the appropriate symmetry and tracelessness
conditions, in subsection ic5.

a show that the spinor metrics found from the dirac analysis are sucient to

b show the equivalence of each orthogonal group to its covering group by show-
ing that (1) the lie algebras have the same dimension, and (2) the deter-
minant (or its square root) of this tensor gives the appropriate orthogonal
metric. (hint: do the cases d+ + d = 4 and 6 rst, and specialize to 3 and
5.)

exercise xc2.3

consider the groups so(n,n) and so(n+1,n). explicitly construct a real
representation of the  matrices by modifying the method of subsection xc1,
demonstrating that all such spinors are real.

besides the dirac spinors and dirac matrices , and the irreducible spinors and
pauli matrices , it is also useful to introduce irreducible real (majorana) spinors
and corresponding matrices  . when the irreducible spinors are already real these
are the same, but when the irreducible spinors are complex this real spinor is just the
direct sum of the irreducible spinor and its complex conjugate, a spinor with twice as
many components. in general, these generalized majorana spinors and matrices have
many properties that are independent of the number of dimensions, but depend on
the number of time dimensions:

for d odd, there is only one irreducible spinor, so there is a metric m  or m 
to relate the two spinors listed. for d  2d twice odd (2 mod 4), the original
irreducible spinor was complex, so there is a metric representing a u(1) generator
that rotates the complex spinor and its complex conjugate oppositely. (i.e., its the
identity on the complex spinor and minus the identity for the complex conjugate.)
for d  2d = 3, 4, 5 mod 8, the original spinor was pseudoreal, and this u(1)
can be extended to an su(2): since the complex spinor and its complex conjugate

c. higher dimensions

659

transform the same way under the orthogonal group, they can be paired as a doublet
of su(2). this doubled representation is a real representation of the orthogonal
group  su(2), since the direct product of the two antisymmetric charge-conjugation
matrices is symmetric (two s under transposition).

3. other spins

before considering supersymmetry in higher dimensions, we rst study represen-
tations of the poincare group there. from the general analysis of section iib, we
know that general on-shell representations follow from the massless ones, which can
be classied by their representation of the lightcone little group so(d2). speci-
cally, the bosons can be described as traceless tensors of a certain symmetry (labeled
by a young tableau), while the fermions can be labeled as the direct product of such
tensors with an irreducible spinor, with a tracelessness condition imposed between
any vector index and the spinor index using a  or  matrix. similar methods can be
used to nd the o-shell representations in terms of representations of so(d1,1),
but without subtracting traces. (for full details, see chapter xii.) the gauge degrees
of freedom can be subtracted from these lorentz representations by dropping all lower
vector indices with the value , by the usual lightcone gauge condition; this tells
us the number of total physical + auxiliary degrees of freedom.

in practice, the only interesting massless elds in higher dimensions are:

(1) the metric (graviton),

(2) totally antisymmetric tensors (including scalars and vectors),
(3) spin-3/2 (gravitino), desribed by vectorspinor, and
(4) spinors.

by the methods described above, the counting of physical, auxiliary, and gauge de-
grees of freedom for these elds is (where d is the number of components of an
irreducible spinor of so(d1,1)  see the previous subsection):

exercise xc3.1

derive all the entries in the table. for each type of eld, nd the minimum
d for which physical degrees exist.

we next consider exactly how many higher dimensions are relevant. from the
previous subsection, we see that an irreducible spinor (which we use for the super-
symmetry generators) has 1 component in d=2, 2 in d=3, 4 in d=4, 8 in d= 5 or
6, 16 in d=7, 8, 9, or 10, 32 in d=11, etc. since the maximal lorentz symmetry can
be obtained by looking at the maximum d for which a certain size spinor exists, we
see that the appropriate d for which an irreducible spinor reduces to n irreducible
spinors (for n-extended supersymmetry) in d=4 is

n d
1
4
6
2
10
4
8
11

etc. from the discussion of subsection iic5, we know that supergravity exists only
for n8, and super yang-mills only for n4. this means that simple supergravity
(i.e., any supergravity) exists only for d11, and simple super yang-mills for d10.
since theories with massless states of spin>2 are not of physical interest (in fact, no
interacting examples have been constructed), we can restrict ourselves to looking at
just d=4, 6, 10, and 11. in general, an irreducible multiplet in some d can become
reducible in lower d. however, since irreducible multiplets of supersymmetry are con-
structed as the direct product of the smallest representation of supersymmetry with
an arbitrary representation of the poincare group, this reducibility corresponds di-
rectly to the reducibility of that poincare representation, which occurs simply because
the lorentz group gets smaller upon reduction. in particular, the smallest represen-
tation of supersymmetry is itself irreducible. for the case of simple supersymmetry,
this is the scalar multiplet (scalars and spinors) in d=6, the vector multiplet (super
yang-mills: vectors, spinors, and scalars) in d=10, and supergravity in d=11. the
statement that it is the smallest multiplet in that number of dimensions is directly
related to the fact that it does not exist in higher dimensions.

4. supersymmetry

we rst generalize to arbitrary dimensions some denitions used earlier: to dis-
cuss the properties of supersymmetry that are common to all dimensions (but one

representations can be found as for d=4; we dont have twistors in general, but
we can always use a lightcone frame. we rst need to dene  a, which in general
is independent of  a

the analog of the dirac anticommutation relations (which can be reconstructed if we
combine the two  s, as generalized s, to form a generalized ) is

 (a

in the lightcone frame the momentum is just pa = a

away half the qs, since    are projection operators: using the anticommutation
relations of  ,

2 = , + = + = 0, + +  = 1

the equality of the sizes of the two subspaces follows from parity symmetry,   
 . we thus need to consider only half of the qs, namely  +q. we therefore switch
to a notation where we consider the truncated spinor q with just that half of the
components. this lightcone spinor is an irreducible spinor of so(d2).
in a
majorana basis it satises the same commutation relations as dirac matrices,

{q, q} = 

since q has an even number of components (2n, n > 0) in d > 3, the states that
represent this algebra form a dirac spinor of so(2n) that is reducible to two weyl
spinors. (these spinors should not be confused with those of so(d2), such as q,
which is a vector of this so(2n).) since supersymmetry takes each of these spinors
into the other, one spinor contains all the bosons, while the other contains all the
fermions. there are an equal number of physical boson and fermion states because
the two weyl spinors are equal in size. since so(d2)so(2n), each weyl spinor
of so(2n) is reducible with respect to so(d2). the only exceptions are (1) d=4,
where so(d2)=so(2n)=so(2), and there is one bosonic state and one fermionic
one, and (2) d=10, where so(d2)=so(2n)=so(8).

exercise xc4.1

lets look more closely at these exceptions:

a show that so(d2)=so(2n) only in d=3,4,6,10.
b show that in d=6 the bosons form a reducible representation of the little
group so(d2). how is this possible, when the group so(2n) is the same?
c for d=10, what representations of the little group are the bosons and the
fermions? compare this to the representations of so(2n) formed by the
bosons, fermions, and q itself, and apply this symmetry to the cases d=4,6.

this dirac spinor of so(2n) is the smallest representation of supersymmetry.
it can also be represented in terms of anticommuting coordinates, by dividing up q
into two halves, one of which is complex coordinates, the other half being both the
complex and canonical conjugate (as for the fermionic harmonic oscillators of exercise
ia2.3). the most general representation of supersymmetry is then the direct product
of this one with an arbitrary representation of the poincare group.

all the results of this section can be extended to extended supersymmetry,
with supersymmetry generators qi for an n-valued internal index i, as expected
from our discussion of supergroups in subsection iic4: for example, in d=4 the
supergroup describing extended conformal supersymmetry, su(2,2|n), includes con-
formal symmetry su(2,2), internal symmetry u(n), n supersymmetries, and n s-
supersymmetries. in general, the supersymmetries then satisfy the algbera

{qi, qj} = ij a

pa

the smallest representation of an extended supersymmetry follows as before, where
now the complete lightcone q acts as dirac matrices for so(n2n). other representa-
tions are again found by direct product, now between this smallest supersymmetry
representation and an arbitrary representation of both poincare and the internal sym-
metry. for the more interesting cases, where n itself is a power of 2, the smallest
representation can also be derived by dimensional reduction from higher dimensions
of n=1 (simple) supersymmetry, changing the higher-dimensional algebra only by
setting some components of the momentum to vanish, and noting that a spinor of
higher dimensions reduces to many spinors, as clear from our explicit construction
earlier. (other representations tend to be reducible, since the poincare representation
in the direct product is reducible upon dimensional reduction.) dimensional reduc-
tion can also be dened for an action (for supersymmetric or nonsupersymmetric
theories), by again setting the derivatives with respect to the extra coordinates to
vanish, and also restricting the integration to the reduced set of coordinates. an-
other interpretation is that we expand the elds over all momentum modes in the
extra coordinates, and then drop all but the zero (constant) modes.

we also recall from subsection xc2 the index structure of spinors in d=6, 10,
and 11, which we need to write supersymmetry covariant derivatives. we thus have,
for simple supersymmetry,

d = 6 : {di, dj} = cjii
d = 10 : {d, d} = a
ia
d = 11 : {d, d} = a
ia

where in the case of d=6 we have taken advantage of the fact that so(5,1)=su*(4)
to eliminate vector indices, and introduced the su(2) index i for spinors to make
them majorana.

664

5. theories

we rst consider the scalar multiplet in d=6. the constraints and eld equations

are given by the statement, in terms of supersymmetry covariant derivatives, that

there are only scalars and spinors on shell, and by supersymmetry their physical

polarizations must be equal in number. since a spinor has 4 polarizations in d=6,

we must have 4 real scalars, and thus

dijk = cjik

the second su(2) index k is introduced again to make a spinor (this time the eld)
majorana, and performs a similar service for the scalars. this one equation is suf-

cient to completely describe this multiplet on shell in the free case; interactions

require derivatives, so we wont consider them here. this multiplet reduces to n=2

in d=4 in a very simple way: the su(2) index on d labels the 2 supersymmetries,

and the 4-component spinor index reduces in the obvious way to sl(2,c) indices,
  (,

.
), with appropriate 6d spinor conventions.

exercise xc5.1

show the equations given for the 6d scalar multiplet give the complete eld

equations for all the components, and that only the scalars and spinors shown

explicitly in that equation survive on shell.

this six-dimensional theory gives a simple example of nontrivial dimensional re-

duction: assume we have a 5-dimensional theory with a nontrivial u(1) symmetry.

then we can dimensionally reduce by choosing the elds to depend on the fth coor-

dinate in such a way that the fth component of the momentum of each eld is equal

to a constant m (with dimensions of mass) times its u(1) charge q:

p4 = z = mq

this is consistent at the interacting level because each term in the action satsies

conservation of the u(1) charge as well as conservation of momentum. this is equiv-

alent to how we introduced masses by dimensional reduction in subsection iib4 for

free elds, since any free eld can be complexied. this has an interesting eect

on the supersymmetry algebra: it introduces a u(1) charge z (called central be-

cause it commutes with the rest of the algebra). for example, if we start with the

6d supersymmetry algebra (like the above algebra for the supersymmetry covariant

derivatives), introduce the central charge in reducing to 5, and then do an ordinary

c. higher dimensions

665

reduction to 4 (or vice versa), the supersymmetry algebra becomes (see subsection
ivc7)

{qi, qj.

} = j

i p

.

{qi, qj} = ccijz,

{qi., qj.

if the higher-dimensional theory was massless, then p2 + z 2 = 0 for the 4d theory.
more generally, if the higher-dimensional theory already had masses before the central
charge was introduced, then by supersymmetry it satised p2 + m 2
0  0
(since supersymmetry always has positive potentials), while afterwards the 4d theory
satises

0 = 0, m 2

p2 + z 2 + m 2

0 = 0  m 2 = m 2

0 + z 2  z 2

where m is the 4d mass, in terms of the higher-d mass m0. however, in general, in
the absence of central charges, massive representations of supersymmetry are bigger
than massless ones (because there are twice as many independent supersymmetry
generators on shell, since q is a spinor with 1 helicity for the massless case, but an
su(2) doublet for the massive). so, m 2 = z 2 > 0 has the advantage of allowing
smaller massive representations than when m 2 > z 2 = 0 or when m 2 > z 2 > 0.
note that when m 2 = z 2, so all masses arise from the central charge, (total) mass is
conserved, just as in nonrelativistic physics, although in the relativistic case the mass
z can be negative. (of course, its square is always positive, as is physical energy. the
relation between the relativistic and nonrelativistic cases can be understood through
dimensional reduction: see exercise ia4.5. the mass is also a central charge for the
galilean group, but there the reduction is for a lightlike dimension.)

in the present case, we can choose our u(1) symmetry to be a subgroup of the
extra su(2) internal symmetry (k index) of the 6d scalar multiplet. note that the
algebra of the ds is modied in the same way as that of the qs.

super yang-mills is a bit more interesting, because interactions are easier to
introduce. from the counting arguments given in subsection xc3, we see that a
supersymmetric theory consisting of 1 vector and 1 spinor can exist in d=3, 4, 6,
or 10. this corresponds directly with our analysis of the largest dimensions for
simple supersymmetries: dimensional reduction of a vector gives also scalars, so the
condition of no scalars gives maximum dimensions. we now make an analysis similar
to that of the previous subsection: by dimensional analysis for physical elds, and
using single-majorana-spinor-index notation,

{,} =  a
ia
[,a] = aw 

666

x. supergravity

[a,b] = ifab
applying the jacobi (bianchi) identities, we nd

a( a

) = 0

this identity can be satised only in d=3, 4, 6, or 10. the bianchi identities imply
the eld equations for d=10.

exercise xc5.2

multiply the identity a( a
mutation relation  (a

 b) = ab

) = 0 by  b, and use the  matrix anticom-

 to show that d=3, 4, 6, or 10.

similar methods can be applied to d=11 supergravity. our component counting
for general dimensions, and our helicity analysis for general extended supersymmet-
ric theories in d=4 (applied to the dimensionally reduced theory), can be satised
by adding to the metric (44 physical components) and gravitino (128) a third-rank
antisymmetric tensor gauge eld (84) amnp (with eld strength fmnpq = 1
6[manpq]).
the action for the graviton and gravitino are like those in 4d n=1, while a has not
only the obvious quadratic term but also a chern-simons term:

l = e1[ 1

4r + mmnpnp + 1
43!(4!)2 mnpqrstuvwxamnpfqrstfuvwx
+ 1

96(fabcd)2 + 2f + 4]

(there are also more-complicated fermion interaction terms than in 4d n=1.) the
necessity of the last term can be shown by nding the component form of the super-
symmetry transformations, or by nding the eld equations implied by the superspace
formulation.

6. reduction to d=4

we now look instead at the component formulation of higher-dimensional super
yang-mills. this formulation is o shell except for the lack of auxiliary elds. since
the elds are just a vector and a spinor, the lagrangian consists of just that of super
yang-mills coupled to a spinor in the adjoint representation of the yang-mills group.
upon dimensional reduction, the vector produces some scalars. for example, the
d=10 theory has an so(9,1) symmetry, which reduces in d=4 to the so(3,1)so(6)
subgroup. the so(6) symmetry of the 6 attened dimensions is the su(4) symmetry
of the n=4 supersymmetries. under this reduction, the vector becomes 10  (4, 1)
(1, 6), namely a 4-vector and scalars that form a 6 of su(4), while the spinor becomes
16  (4, 4), a 4d spinor that is also a 4 of su(4) (like the supersymmetry generators).

although  (or , or  ) matrices are necessary in d=10, in d=4 we can convert
to spinor notation for both so(3,1) (=sl(2,c)) and so(6) (=su(4)). thus vectors

looking at the su(3) subgroup of su(4), decompose the states of n=4 super
yang-mills into those of n=3. (use the analysis of subsection iic5 to count
states, in su(n) representations.) do the same to decompose n=4 into n=2

exercise xc6.2

derive the commutation relations of the n=4 yang-mills covariant derivatives
of subsection ivc7 by dimensional reduction of those for 10d n=1 given in
the previous subsection. (dont forget the scalars come from the components
of the vector covariant derivative in the extra dimensions.)

dimensional reduction of (super)gravity is an example of the comparative sim-
plicity of the vierbein (covariant derivative) formalism vs. the metric or even inverse
vierbein (dierential form) formalisms. the reason in this case is that gravity is
treated like yang-mills theory, and gauge vectors result from reducing the graviton.
this is seen most easily from comparison of the coordinate transformation laws:

ea

m = nnea

em

a = nnem

m  ea

x. supergravity

gmn = ppgmn + gp(mn)p

fixing the index m = 1 on m to get the gauge transformations of an abelian vector
resulting from reduction from one extra dimension, and setting 1 = 0 when acting
on any eld as the denition of reduction, we see the identication (in an appropriate
gauge for the so(d,1)/so(d1,1) generators m1a)
m 1
m aa
ea

where a transforms in the usual way for a gauge vector, and  is an additional scalar.
a more transparent way to write this is as

  mm,
   + 11,

ea  ea

mm;

ea = [, ea]

ea  (ea + aa1, 1)

which makes it clear that reduction has simply u(1)-covariantized the gauge param-
eter, transformation, and eld, where 1 is the u(1) generator. (under reduction all
a, being the inverse
elds are u(1) neutral.) on the other hand, the reduction of em
m, and gmn, being the square of that, yields nonlinear reductions, and the u(1)
of ea
covariantization is not manifest. (in particular, in the metric formalism the metric,
and thus the u(1) vector, does not even appear in the covariant derivative, except in
terms with its derivatives.)

exercise xc6.3

derive the result of exercise ixc1.1 by dimensional reduction.

exercise xc6.4

lets work out the details of this simple example, reduction of pure gravity
from one extra dimension:

a find the reduction of cab

c by examining the commutators of the reduced ea.
(fab comes out directly.) using the expression of the lagrangian in terms of
the cs from exercise ixa5.2, nd the reduced action, including a cosmological

term. (drop ther dx1. we can think of this as compactication on a circle,

independence from x1 yielding a constant factor upon integration, which can
be absorbed.)

b the scalar appears in a funny way, seen previously in subsection ixb5. rather
than eld redenitions, it is more convenient to reintroduce local scale invari-
ance (after the reduction), as in subsection ixb5, introducing the dilaton .

c. higher dimensions

669

then make a simple redenition that replaces  and  with the canonical
elds . (the f 2 and cosmological terms then appear with powers of .)
reduction from one extra dimension can give only a single (abelian) gauge vector,
but two or more dimensions can yield nonabelian gauge groups as the spacetime
symmetries of the compactied dimensions. for example, compactifying n extra
dimensions into an n-sphere gives so(n+1). (however, compactifying to a box with
periodic boundary conditions gives an abelian group again.) the generalization is
then

   + igi,

ea  (ea + aa

igi, i

igi)

where the only dependence on the extra dimensions is implicit in the group generators
gi. if we add matter elds (before reduction), then the elds can be constrained to
be independent of the extra dimensions (i.e., singlets of gi) when their indices are
at.

another possible modication is to make the action of the generators on matter
elds nontrivial. if we already have an internal symmetry group, with generators gi,
identical to that of the gi, then we can impose on all matter elds 

gi = gi

to determine their dependence on the extra coordinates. the fact that the original
higher-dimensional action was invariant under the gi guarantees that the resultant
dependence on the extra coordinates will cancel. the simplest example was applied
to supersymmetry in the previous subsection: in the abelian case we can set

i1 = m g

where we are free to scale the abelian generator by a mass parameter m (unlike the
nonabelian case, where it would change the algebra).

similar results can be obtained for supergravity, but the results are more com-
plicated, because the scalars (which appear for n>3) appear in nonlinear  models.
furthermore, although these models can be constructed by the coset method dis-
cussed in subsection iva3, the coset space g/h is noncompact, because the group g
is noncompact, although the subgroup h is compact. this is a consequence of the fact
that the compensating scalars of the group h=u(n) (or su(8) for n=8) appear
with the wrong-sign kinetic term (as the dilaton even in ordinary gravity). thus, con-
formal supergravity is coupled to matter with scalars in the adjoint representation
of the noncompact group g, while gauging away the compensating scalars leaves the
physical scalars of the coset space g/h. a simpler analog is n=1 supergravity coupled

670

x. supergravity

to a scalar multiplet (see subsection xb7). this is the same as conformal supergravity
coupled to the matter action   , which has a symmetry g=u(1,1), while n=1
supergravity has a gauge group u(1).
including weyl scale invariance gl(1), the
physical scalars then inhabit the coset space u(1,1)/u(1)gl(1)=su(1,1)/gl(1).
in the case of extended supergravity, the group g can be found by noting that
the physical scalars parametrizing g/h form the representation ijkl (totally anti-
symmetric, and complex conjugate) of the group h. we then look for the group g
whose adjoint representation transforms under the h subgroup as these scalars + ad-
j for h,
joint of h. we can also determine g by dening group generators for g as mi
) for g/h, and write commutation relations
and mijkl (and hermitian conjugate m
4! ijklmnpqmmnpq
consistent with covariance under h. for n=8 we also have m
(and the same for the corresponding physical scalars). the result for the coset space
g/h is

= 1

n = 4 : su(4)  su(1, 1)/u(4) = su(1, 1)/u(1)

5 : su(5, 1)/u(5)

6 : so*(12)/u(6)

8 : e7(+7)/su(8)

where e7(+7) is a noncompact form (wick rotation) of the exceptional group e7.

an additional complication is that the vectors represent the full h symmetry
only on shell. for example, for n=2 we have a single vector, as in electromagnetism.
maxwells equations without sources have a u(1) symmetry, s-duality, that trans-
forms f by a phase (and f .
.
 by the opposite), that mixes the eld equations with
the bianchi identities. with sources, it mixes electric and magnetic charge, since it
mixes electric and magnetic elds. so, in general we must introduce both electric
and magnetic potentials for each vector. furthermore, for n=6 the vectors appear
as both f ij
 and fijklmn (one extra vector). (for n=8, the two are related by an
 tensor, just as  and .) in this version of extended supergravity, all the vectors
are abelian. there is also a version where they gauge so(n), but that theory has a
cosmological constant.

there are three areas of application of qcd, as dened by the region of momen-
tum space they address: (1) one is perturbative qcd, which applies to large relative,
transverse velocity of (some of) the constituents of the hadrons. in this approach
such an amplitude is divided into a half consisting of high-energy, asymptotically-free
partons, which is calculated perturbatively in the gauge coupling, and a half con-
sisting of low-energy, conned partons, which is nonperturbative, and therefore not
calculated.

(2) another area deals with the low-energy behavior of qcd  with properties
of the vacuum (e.g., broken chiral symmetry), or the lowest-mass hadrons, scattering
at small relative velocities. this approach is nonperturbative with respect to the
gauge coupling, and instead perturbs in derivatives, as in rst-quantized jwkb. the
methods used include instantons, lattice qcd, current algebra, dispersion relations,
nonlinear  models, and duality. this low-energy behavior really says nothing about
connement, just as the low-energy states of the hydrogen atom tell us nothing about
ionization.

a closely related problem is that the nonperturbative information about qcd
that comes from (electromagnetic-type) duality considerations, which relates weak
coupling to strong coupling as g  1/g, is not really relating quark-gluon physics
to hadronic physics, but is relating quark-gluon physics to monopole physics; i.e., it
relates a description of weakly coupled electric color charges to a similar looking
theory of weakly coupled magnetic color charges. thus, the dual theory, being
formally of the same type as the original, except for a relabeling of what is called
electric and what is called magnetic, does not give anything that looks any more
like hadrons, or make it any easier to calculate.

(3) the one nonperturbative approach that does deal with high (hadron) energies
is string theory: it incorporates hadrons of arbitrarily high mass, and studies their
scattering at high energies.
it also shows that stringy (hadron-like) behavior is a
characteristic of qcd coupling g  1, while g  0 or  have non-stringy (parton-
like) behavior: string perturbation expands in g = ln g, not g nor 1/g; duality is the
symmetry g  g. furthermore, this g is the coupling that denes the free string,
i.e., how partons bind to form strings. the coupling that determines how hadrons
couple to each other is 1/nc, as described topologically in subsection vc9. (however,
the relation of duality to the 1/nc expansion is unclear, since duality has been studied
so far only in relation to theories where the group is spontaneously broken to u(1),

a. scattering

673

so eectively nc = 1, or with respect to instantons, which are always dened for
su(2) subgroups, so eectively nc = 2. thus, it has not been possible to apply such
duality arguments simultaneously with a 1/nc analysis. similarly, since both these
duality approaches deal only with low-energy behavior, they are dicult to relate to

connement.)

most of the research eort on string theory has been directed toward models with
critical dimension d4 (10, 11, or 26): attempts to relate to the real world involve
choosing a solution of minimal energy with all but 4 dimensions compactied, and

considering perturbations about that solution. (the extra dimensions cannot be com-

pletely eliminated without losing renormalizability.) unfortunately, the ambiguity in

choice of such a solution results in the loss of predictability, which is what unication

and renormalizability are all about.

however, historically the true usefulness of such string theories has been for the

concepts and features of eld theory they have revealed: for example, supersymmetry

(sections iic and ivc, and chapter x), the gervais-neveu gauge (subsection vib4),

topological (1/n) expansion (subsection viic4), rst-quantized brst approach to

gauge theory (chapter xii), and certain simplications in one-loop amplitudes were

all discovered through studies of 10- and 26-dimensional string theory, even though

they all are now understood more simply through ordinary eld theory. this is due

to the fact that string theories are so complex and restrictive that they require the

most powerful techniques available. clearly such strings are useful toy models for

learning about particle eld theories, and about general properties of string theory

that might lead to generalizations to include realistic 4-dimensional string theories.

(in fact, the rst paper on string theory was written in 1747 by dalembert, and was

the rst appearance of the wave equation and the dalembertian. thus, eld theory,

quantum mechanics, and special relativity can trace their origins to string theory.)

in subsections ivb1 and viic4 we briey discussed how hadrons are expected to

arise as strings from qcd. in this chapter we analyze the dynamics of this mecha-

nism. we begin by formulating the theory in terms of strings directly. perturbative

calculations are performed using rst-quantized path integrals. the only experimen-

tal evidence for strings is as a description of hadrons; to some extent the way that

qcd leads to strings can be understood with similar rst-quantized methods, based

on random lattices.

string theories are the only known theories that exhibit (s-matrix) duality. unlike

other s-matrix approaches, they provide an explicit perturbative calculational scheme,

like eld theory, and string theory can be formulated as a eld theory. also like eld

theory, string theory has consistency conditions at the classical and quantum levels,

related to gauge invariance and renormalizability.

the dening concept of the string is that it is a two-dimensional object: just as

the particle is dened as a point object whose trajectory through spacetime is one-

dimensional (a worldline), the string has as its trajectory a two-dimensional surface,

the worldsheet. this leads to a much simpler picture of interactions: for interact-

ing particles, the geometric picture of a worldline becomes a graph, whose geometry

is singular at the interaction points. for interacting strings, we have instead a world-

sheet with nontrivial topology: sphere, disk, torus (doughnut), etc. for example, a

tree graph now looks more like a real tree, in that the branches now have thickness,

and they join smoothly to the rest of the tree. there are two types of free strings:

open (two ends) and closed (no boundary). their worldsheets are a rectangle and a

tube (cylinder).

1. regge theory

in principle there is no dierence between a fundamental state and a bound

state: we can always write an action with every state represented by an independent

eld. of course, such an action might not be renormalizable, but that seems more

of a formal distinction. a more physical one is based on the qualitative property

that bound states have radial and other excitations with related properties, while

fundamental states are more unique.

regge theory is an approach to bound states that treats them as fundamental. a

family of states that are dierent excitations of the same ground state is treated as a

single entity. although basically an approach based on fundamental properties of the

s-matrix, when combined with perturbation theory it leads directly to string theory.

a quantitative denition of this concept follows from a generalization of a concept
seen in perturbative eld theory. in amplitudes following from feynman diagrams
the nature of intermediate states can be seen from the momentum-space behavior:
single-particle states appear as poles (in the sense of complex analysis) in some mo-
mentum invariants, 1/(p2 + m2), where this p is the sum of some of the external
momenta, representing the momentum of the internal state. (any tree graph is a
simple example.) two-particle states appear as cuts in these invariants, where the
branch point represents the state where the two particles are at rest with respect to
one another, and the rest of the cut corresponds to arbitrary relative velocities. (for
example, a one-loop propagator correction has a branch point at p2 = (m1 + m2)2
for intermediate particles of masses m1 and m2.) similar remarks apply to other
multi-particle states. analytic s-matrix theory was an attempt to formulate par-
ticle physics in terms of the s-matrix by replacing the property of locality of the
action with maximal analyticity of the s-matrix in momentum space. (of course,
unitarity and poincare invariance can be described easily in terms of the s-matrix;
even analogs of renormalizability can be formulated in terms of certain properties of
the high-energy behavior.) unfortunately, the most general form of such nonanalytic
behavior (poles, cuts, etc.), as discovered from analyzing feynman diagrams, proved
to be too complicated to provide a practical method for dening a theory.

since poincare invariance means that not only momentum is conserved but also
angular momentum, a natural next step was to consider the analytic behavior in that
variable as well. this behavior is seen already in nonrelativistic theories; here we will
approach the concept in a language most relevant to relativistic physics. the simplest
example of regge behavior is the 4-point s-matrix; this is the relativistic analog
of a nonrelativistic particle in a potential. (we can think of an innitely massive
second particle as producing the potential, or separate center-of-mass and relative
coordinates for two nite-mass particles.) also, the feynman diagrams that appear
in the nonrelativistic problem are ladder diagrams: the sides of the ladder represent
the two scattering particles, while the rungs represent a perturbation expansion for
the potential. it can be shown that such diagrams give the leading behavior of this
amplitude at high energies. here the appropriate high energy limit is dened in
terms of the mandelstam variables (see subsection ia4); by high energy we mean,
e.g., s   for xed t.

the high-energy behavior of ladder diagrams can be shown to be of the form (in

units of an appropriate mass)

a(s, t) = kg2 [(t)](s)(t),

(t) = a + g2b(t)

676

xi. strings

where a is a constant that describes the behavior of the tree graph, and b(t) is de-
termined by the one-loop graph. (both, and the constant k, are independent of g.)
this amplitude takes a simple form under a modied type of sommerfeld-watson
transform:

a(s, t) =i dj

2i

 (j)(s)j f (j, t) =

1

j! sjf (j, t)

xj=0

the contour integral is taken as counterclockwise about the positive real axis to obtain
the last form, where it picks up the poles of  (j) (see exercise viia2.3b), but can
be deformed to surround the singularities of f . in this case, a pole at j = (t) in f
will reproduce our original ladder amplitude, while integrating it around the positive
real axis gives

f (j, t) = k

g2

j  (t)  a(s, t) = k

xj=0

1

j!sj

g2

j  (t)

which shows that particles of spin j contribute simple poles in t to the amplitude
at (t) = j when (t) can be approximated as linear near that value. the spin of
the intermediate particle follows from the sj factor. (this is clear from examining a
4-point tree graph where the external lines are scalars and the internal line carries j
indices, and must contract the momenta of its two ends. there are also contributions
of lower spins from traces.) thus the regge trajectory (t) determines not only
the high-energy behavior of the amplitude (for negative t), but also the spins and
masses of the bound states (for positive t): looking at the graph for j = (t), there
is a bound state of spin j and mass t whenever the curve crosses an integer value
of j. the contribution at n loops in perturbation theory to f (j, t) is a multiple pole
(j  a)(n+1), which contributes to a(s, t) a term proportional to (s)a[ln(s)]n.

exercise xia1.1

consider the amplitude

f(0) 6= 0

where f is taylor expandable. by expanding f , show that a sum of regge
amplitudes is obtained, where the leading trajectory is (t), and there are
daughter trajectories (t)  n for positive integer n.

unfortunately, for eld theories with a nite number of fundamental particles, the
trajectories are rather boring, containing only a nite number of bound states. in cer-
tain cases a trajectory may include one of the fundamental particles itself (reggeiza-
tion). because of the usual infrared divergences, such calculations can be applied

a. scattering

677

directly to s-matrix elements only for fundamental massive particles; for fundamental
massless particles, as in conning theories (like qcd), these results require external
lines to be o-shell, and some knowledge of the parton wave functions is needed.
regge behavior thus gives a measurable denition of connement: if the scattering
amplitudes of color-singlet states (or color-singlet channels of o-shell amplitudes of

color-nonsinglet states) have linear trajectories, the constitutent color-nonsinglet par-
ticles can be said to be conned. on the other hand, if the regge trajectory rises
only to nite spin and then falls, as with the higgs eect, then there is only color
screening; color-singlet states might not be observable, but we do not see the innite
number of radial excitations characteristic of connement. another possibility is that
arbitrarily high spin is reached at nite energy: this is characteristic of coloumb
binding, and indicates that a new, ionized phase is reached above that energy.

experimentally, hadrons are observed to have regge behavior with respect to
both high-energy behavior and spectrum. however, those regge trajectories are
approximately linear, thus indicating an (near) innite number of bound states. the
linearity of the trajectories can be shown to be related to the relative stability of these

unstable particles (as compared to what is found in ladder approximations). this
suggests a formulation of the theory of hadrons where the whole regge trajectory
is treated as fundamental. it can be shown that in any such regge theory based
on a perturbation expansion where the tree graphs have only poles in the angular
momentum j (whose accuracy is implied by the linearity of the observed trajectories),
that the theory has a further property called (s-t) duality: this property states
that the amplitude can be expressed as a sum of poles in either the s or t channel,
rather than as a sum over both:

a(s, t) =xn

cn(t)
s  sn

=xn

cn(s)
t  tn

s=

this holds even when the sets of particles exchanged in the two channels are dif-
ferent, due to quantum numbers of the external states. this relation has also been
experimentally veried (approximately).

explicit realizations of such dual models of the s-matrix in terms of rst-
quantized systems are called string theories. they explain the linearity of the
regge trajectories by the harmonic-oscillator structure of the string hamiltonian,
and the duality of the amplitudes by the conformal invariance (stretchiness) of the
string worldsheet.

2. classical mechanics

we now consider string theory as derived by rst quantization. as for particles,
the rst step is to study the classical mechanics, which determines the appropriate
set of variables, the kinetic term of the eld theoretic action, some properties of
the interactions, and some techniques useful for perturbation. just as the simplest
such action for the particle produces only the relatively uninteresting case of the
scalar, the most obvious action for the string yields a model that is not only too
simple, but quantum mechanically consistent only in 26 dimensions. however, this
toy model exhibits many relevant qualitative features, such as regge behavior and
duality. later well consider the source of its problems by relating to four-dimensional
particle theories.

the simplest classical mechanics action for the string is a direct generalization of
that for the massless scalar particle: for the lagrangian form of this action we write

sl =

1

z d2

2

ggmn 1

2 (mx a)  (nx b)ab

where x a(m) is the position in spacetime of a point at worldsheet coordinates m =
(0, 1) = (, ), gmn(m) is the (inverse) worldsheet metric, and  is a normalization
constant, the string tension. it can also be associated with the at-space spacetime
metric ab; if we couple a spacetime metric, then its vacuum value can be taken as
ab/, where  is the gravitational coupling, as discussed in subsection ixa5.

exercise xia2.1

analyze the classical mechanics of the string by approximating  by a set of
discrete points, so x()  xn+1  xn, etc. choose the gauge x 0 =  . show
that the string then acts as a bunch of particles connected by springs, and
nd all the usual spring properties: tension, speed of wave propagation, etc.

a new feature of this action (compared to the particles) is that it is (2d) weyl
scale invariant. this gauge invariance can be used to gauge away one component of the
metric, in addition to the two that can be gauged away using 2d general coordinate
invariance. the net result is that the worldsheet metric can be completely gauged
away (except for some bits at boundaries), just as for the particle. however, this same
invariance prevents the addition of a worldsheet cosmological term: in the particle
case, such a term was needed to introduce mass. here, mass is introduced through
the coecient 1/ of the (x)2 term: the same scale invariance that prevents use
of a cosmological term also prevents this coecient from being absorbed into the
denition of the worldsheet metric.

a. scattering

679

just as for the particle, the metric can be eliminated by its equation of motion,
resulting in a more geometrical, but less useful, form of the action: in this case the
equation of motion (virasoro constraints)

(mx)  (nx) = 1

2gmngpq(px)  (qx)

after taking the determinant of both sides, gives

s =

gmn = (mx)  (nx)

this is the area of the string in terms of the induced metric gmn, analogously to the
particle case. the induced metric measures length as usually measured in spacetime:

dmdngmn = (dmmx)  (dnnx) = (dx)2

equivalently, this action can be written in terms of the area element dx a  dx b:
dx a  dx b = (d00x [a)(d11x b])

2(dx a  dx b)2,

s =

for purposes of quantization, its also useful to have the hamiltonian form of
the action. this also allows us to see how the virasoro constraints generalize the
klein-gordon equation, and then nd the brst operator. by the usual methods of
converting from lagrangian to hamiltonian, we nd

classical) commutation relations of the constraints p 2
() close. (hint: use the
identity f (a)(a  b) = f (b)(a  b)  f(b)(a  b).)

since 2d general coordinate (and even just lorentz) invariance is no longer man-
ifest, for some purposes we need to generalize this to a form that is rst-order with
respect to both  and  derivatives:

s1 =

z d2

[(mx)  p m + (g)1/2gmn

2 p m  p n]

obviously reproduces sl after eliminating p m. eliminating just p 1 gives a simpler
way of deriving sh (with p 0 = p ).

since open strings have boundaries, the action implies boundary conditions, orig-
inating from integration by parts when deriving the eld equations. in the last form

of the action variation of the rst term gives, in addition to ther d2 terms (p ) x
and (x)  p for the eld equations, a boundary termr dmmn(x)  p n, where

dm is a line integral along the boundary, and the mn picks the component of p m
normal to the boundary. we thus have

nmp m = 0 at boundaries

where nm is a vector normal to the boundary. from the constraint imposed by varying
gmn, it then follows that

(tmp m)2 = 0 at boundaries

where tm is a vector tangent to the boundary (or any vector, for that matter). since
by the eld equations p m  gmnnx, this means that the boundary is lightlike in
spacetime: the ends of the string travel at the speed of light.

3. gauges

in direct analogy to the particle (subsection iiib2), the two most useful gauges
are the conformal gauge, dened by completely xing the worldsheet metric, and
the lightcone gauge, which is not manifestly globally covariant but is a complete xing
of the residual gauge invariance of the conformal gauge. in the conformal gauge we
set

gmn = mn

a. scattering

681

by using the 2 coordinate invariances and the 1 scale invariance to x the 3 compo-
nents of the symmetric tensor gmn. the coordinate part of this gauge is essentially the
temporal gauge g0m = 0m, just as for the particle (g00 = v2 = 1). also as for the
particle, this gauge cant be xed everywhere (see also subsections iiia5 and iiic2),
but the equation of motion from the metric is implied everywhere by imposing it at
the just the boundaries in  . in this gauge the equations of motion for x are just the
2d klein-gordon equation, which is easy to solve in 2d lightcone coordinates:

+x = 0  x = x(+)( + ) + x()(  )

(we have used    in place of  for later convenience.) the constraints are then
p 2
()  (x())2 = 0. this directly relates to the form of 2d conformal transformations,
which are innite-dimensional in d=2:

ds2 = 2d+d  + = f(+)(+),

 = f()()

the constraints are the generators of these conformal transformations. (as described
in subsection iiia5, the constraints generate the gauge transformations; the global
transformations are those that preserve the temporal gauge.)

for the lightcone gauge, we again x the (spacetime) +-components of the vari-
ables, and solve the +-components of the equations of motion (found by varying the
-components). looking at the equations of motion rst, using the rst-order form
of the action,

0 =

s
p m  mx + + (g)1/2gmnp +n

am = p +m, bm = mx +

 (g)1/2gmn = (a  b)1(mpapnqaq  bmbn);
(as seen, e.g., by using mnan, bm as a basis), and
d

0 =

s
x  mp +m 

d z d p +0 = 0

which identies r d p +0 as the conserved momentum p+, up to a factor of 2

.
x in the action, where x() = x + ...). similarly,

(since p is really the coecient of
s/gmn determines p m, and thus x.

we then choose as our main set of gauge conditions

x + = k,

p +0 = k

for some constant k, which explicitly determines  , and determines  up to a function
of  : an equivalent way to dene the lightcone  in terms of an arbitrary spacelike
coordinate  is

 = k1z 

0

d p +0()

682

xi. strings

which identies  as the amount of momentum p+ between that value of  and  = 0
(at xed  ). we thus have that the length of the string (the range of , not the
physical length) is

l = k1z d p +0 = 2p+k1

we then need to x the location of  = 0 as some function ( ): since in this gauge

1p +1 = 0

so p +1 is also a function of just  , we further x the gauge for  by choosing

p +1 = 0  (g)1/2gmn = mn

thus the lightcone gauge is a special case of the conformal gauge, after also xing
scale gauge g = 1. for the open string, this almost xes ( ) at  = 0, which we
can take as one boundary: the boundary condition for x + is now

0 = n  x +  n0

since in this (and any conformal) gauge mx  mnp n. thus the normal to the
boundary must be in the  direction, so the boundary is at constant . this means
we have one constant left to x:

 = 0 at one boundary (open string)

this invariance was left because all our previous gauge conditions preserved global 
translation. unfortunately, there is no corresponding convenient gauge choice for the
closed string, so there we leave just this one invariance. in summary, our complete
set of ligtcone gauge conditions is now:

gauge :

x + = k,

p +m = km
0 ,

 = 0 at one boundary (open string)

the lightcone action is now, in hamiltonian form,

the only distinction between open and closed strings is the boundary condition
(since closed strings by denition have no boundary). for closed strings we have only
periodicity in  (by denition of closed), while for open strings we have

x(, 0) = x(, l) = 0

a. scattering

683

one consequence, as we just saw, is that closed strings have one residual gauge invari-
ance in the lightcone gauge. these two strings can be made to resemble each other
more closely by extending the open string to twice its length, dening x for negative
 by

x(,) = x(, )

this is the known as the method of images: x(,) is identied with its mirror
image in the  axis, x(,). then the two strings both satisfy periodic boundary
conditions, while the open string has this one additional condition. we also choose

k = 2p+,

 =(cid:26) 1

1
2

(open)
(closed)  l =




so the length of the closed string is 2, while the open string has original length  that
has now been doubled to match the closed string. our choice of phase in relating x
for positive and negative  for the open string automatically enforces the boundary
condition x(, 0) = 0 at one end of the string, while the condition x(, ) = 0 at
the other end is implied in the same way by the closed string boundary condition
of periodicity, which can be written as x(, ) = x(,). the picture is then that
the open string is a closed string that has collapsed on itself, so that for half of the
range of  x doubles back over the path it covered for the other half.

because  has a nite range, x can always be expanded in fourier modes in that
variable; the boundary conditions slightly restrict the form of this expansion. we saw
that the equations of motion, being second-order in  -derivatives, gave two modes
for each initial state: a left-handed one and a right-handed one. we need to be a bit
more precise about the zero-modes (independent of ): we can separate them out as

x(, ) = x +

2

l

p +q 

2 [y(+)( + ) + y()(  )],

z d y() = 0

where y contains only nonzero-modes. (the normalization of p, conjugate to x, comes
from the  .
xp term in the lagrangian.) then x represents the center of mass of the
string, and p its total momentum. note that this implies x() arent quite periodic:

x()( + 2) = x()() + 2p

now the periodicity boundary conditions shared by open and closed strings imply

while the extra boundary condition for the open string implies

y()( + 2) = y()()

y(+)() = y()() = y ()

684

xi. strings

allowing us to drop the subscript in that case. thus, the closed string has twice as
many modes as the open, except for the nonperiodic part, corresponding to the total
momentum and average position. this is related to the interpretation that the open
string is a closed string with its two halves occupying the same path. this doubling
also shows up in the constraints: for the closed string we have p 2
(), while for the
open string we can consider just p 2
(+)(). in the lightcone
gauge we solve these constraints for x, by integrating

4. quantum mechanics

the more interesting features of the string dont appear until quantization. in
particular, we can already see at the free level the discrete mass spectrum character-
istic of regge theory, or of bound states in general.

canonical quantization is simplest in the lightcone gauge. as for particles, canon-
ical quantization is convenient only in mechanics (rst quantization), not eld theory
(second quantization). as can be seen from the lightcone action, the hamiltonian
is part of the constraints: for the spinless particle, we had only the constraint
p2 + m2 = 0, which became e = h in the lightcone gauge x + = p+ after iden-
tifying the lightcone energy e = p+p and its hamiltonian h = 1
i + m2). (see
subsection iiib2.) the string hamiltonian can be rewritten conveniently in terms of
p . since the closed string is eectively just a doubling of the open string, we treat
the open string rst. the hamiltonian is simply

2 (p2

h =z 



d
2

p 2
i

1
2

where p = p(+). since we have chosen x + = 2p+ , we have e = 2p+p.

to identify the individual particle states, we fourier expand the worldsheet vari-
ables in . as for the particle, we can work at  = 0, since all the dynamics is
contained in the constraints. equivalently, from the nonrelativistic view of the light-
cone formalism, we can work in the schrodinger picture where the  dependence is in
the wave function instead of the operators. we expand as

p () =

xn=

anein,

a0 = 2p,

an = an

686

xi. strings

from the canonical commutation relations for p and x,

we have

[ pi(1), pj(2)] = 2i(2  1)ij

[aim, ajn] = mm+n,0ij

as well as the usual [pi, xj] = iij, and thus can relate the modes to the usual
harmonic oscillator creation and annihilation operators:

an = nan,

an = nan  [am, an] = mn

for positive n. after normal ordering, we nd for the hamiltonian

h = p2

i + n  0,

n =

nainain

xn=1

 h  e = (p2

a + m 2),

m 2 = 1(n  0)

for some constant 0.

from the expression for the mass in terms of the number operator n, we see
that the nth oscillator ain raises the mass-squared of the ground state |0i by n
(and similarly for multiple applications of these oscillators). for any given mass, the
highest-spin state is the symmetric, traceless tensor part of multiple ai1s acting on
|0i: this describes the leading regge trajectory, with spins

j = m 2 + 0

lets look rst at the rst excited level, obtained by acting on the scalar ground
state |0i with the lowest-mass oscillators ai1. clearly this describes a (lightcone)
transverse vector, with no stuckelberg scalar for describing a massive vector. (i.e., it
has only d2 components, not the d1 necessary for a massive vector.) thus this
state describes a massless vector, so

0 = 1

the ground state is then a scalar tachyon with m 2 = 1. for any given level
past the rst excited level, one can check explicitly that the states coming from the
various oscillators include the necessary stuckelberg elds. for example, at the second
excited level, ai1aj1 contains a traceless, symmetric tensor and a scalar (coming from
the trace), while ai2 is a vector; they combine to describe a massive tensor. the
proof that this works to all mass levels is closure of the poincare algebra quantum

a. scattering

687

mechanically: the only nontrivial commutator is [ji, jj] = 0, since only ji is
higher than quadratic (cubic) in oscillators (from the form of x and p  after solving
constraints), so normal-ordering ambiguities lead to more than just constant terms.
for reasons to be explained in chapter xii, the algebra(ic computations) in calculating
this commutator is the same in any rst-quantized theory as the rst-quantized brst
algebra. of course, the proof of closure is already the same in principle because both
algebras are a consequence of the constraints, the conformal algebra. thus, any
anomaly must show up in the conformal algebra itself, which will be considered in
the following subsection.

exercise xia4.1

check the third excited level massive representations.

the closed string works similarly to the open, but with two sets of harmonic

oscillators, but with

in that case we nd

p(+) = p() = 1
2p

m 2 = 21(n(+) + n()  2)

where n(+) and n() are the number operators for the two independent sets of os-
cillators. in the lightcone gauge the closed string has the residual gauge invariance

generated byr d x  /x; this gives the residual constraint

n(+) = n()

the closed-string states are thus the direct product of two open-string states of the
same mass: for example, the ground state is a scalar tachyon with m 2 = 21,
while the rst excited states are massless ones from the product of two vectors  a
scalar, an antisymmetric tensor, and a symmetric, traceless tensor. the leading regge

covariant quantization of the string can be performed in several ways: one is to
use the osp methods of chapter xii, as applied to the lorentz generators derived
from the lightcone analysis. another is to use the usual brst of subsection via, as
applied to gravity in subsection ixb1, treating the mechanics of the string as a 2d

eld theory. for the case of the conformal gauge, introducing ghosts cm corresponding
to the gauge parameters, and antighosts bmn paired with the lagrange multipliers
of the gauge conditions (nakanishi-lautrup elds), we nd the ghost action

ggmn = mn,

ggmn = (mn)  gmngpqpq

 lg = b++c + b+c+

where in the last step we have introduced a background zweibein for applications
such as the background eld gauge, or geometries that do not admit the conformal
gauge globally, and attened the indices on the ghosts so the tracelessness of b (which

follows from that of ggmn) can be solved explicitly. (the conformal-gauge weyl

and lorentz gauge conditions do not involve derivatives in the transformation laws
of the gauge-xing conditions, so the ghosts are just algebraic.)

5. anomaly

closure of the brst algebra, or lightcone poincare algebra, is nontrivial because
of the innite summations over oscillators, or equivalently because of integration over
the two-dimensional momentum (which is quantized as mode number in the  di-
rection because of the nite extent of ). as usual, brst invariance is equivalent
to gauge invariance, and we can check for anomalies in the usual way, now applied
to the 2d eld theory corresponding to the mechanics of the string. because of
conformal invariance the boundaries of the worldsheet are irrelevant; we can confor-
mally transform them to innity; then the anomaly calculations are similar to those
applied to the schwinger model in subsection viiia8. (in particular, see exercise vi-
iia8.1.) the gauge invariances in question are coordinate invariance and local scale
invariance, whose preservation is the vanishing of the divergence and trace of the
energy-momentum tensor. as seen from our analysis for the schwinger model, this
implies that the quantum corrections to the energy-momentum tensor must them-
selves vanish when the external elds are restricted to gravity only. the calculation
again involves one-loop propagator corrections; performed in position space, we get
the product of two propagators between the same two points, with various numbers
of derivatives acting on either end of either propagator.

the classical energy-momentum tensors can be found by various methods: a
straightforward way is to use the methods of chapter ix. a simpler method is to note
that the local lorentz group in d=2 is abelian (so(1,1)=gl(1)), and the coupling of
the lorentz connection is proportional to the spin (number of + minus  indices,

a. scattering

689

as used in the 2d spinor notation of subsections viiia7-8). this immediately tells
us the coupling of the zweibein from the action for terms linear in derivatives:

il = w1w  it++ = 1

2w


 +1w + (w  1

2)+(w1w)

where w is any eld with w the number of + vector indices minus  (half the number
of spinor indices). we have written the most general terms with one derivative. (it
is + to get the right lorentz weight for t++, but also because  vanishes by the
free eld equation.) the rst term is the zweibein term, the second is the lorentz
connection term; the coecient of the second term is xed by considering the cases
w = 0 (scalar, so all derivatives act on it) and 1  w = 0. (as a check, the second
term vanishes by antisymmetry for w = 1  w = 1/2.) for convenience we rewrite
this result as

it++ = ww+1w + (w  1)(+w)1w

the same result holds for t from a + action. this includes the classical string
action

p+  p + p+  x + p  +x

as well as the conformal-gauge ghost action

b++c + b+c+

(the factor of e1 can be absorbed into the elds by a local scale transformation; its
irrelevant for dening t.)

the calculation for the matrix element for two t++s (i.e., for two h background
elds) is now simple: the propagators go as 1/(x  x), and the various directions
of derivatives from the vertices give either both hitting the same propagator or one
hitting each, giving either (x1)2 = x4 or x12x1 = 2x4. the matrix element
is then proportional to

[w2 + (w  1)2] + 2[2w(w  1)] = 6(w  1

2)2  1

2

with the usual extra minus sign in the fermionic case. (as a check, this result is
consistent with bosonization: a real, bosonic scalar gives the same result as a complex,
fermionic spinor.) taking (spacetime dimension) d w = 0 xs and 2 (fermionic)
w = 2 ghosts (actually one with w = 2 and the conjugate with w = 1), this adds
up to

d  26 = 0  d = 26

for anomaly cancelation. thus, we have two conditions on this string that make
it unsuitable for describing mesons: unphysical intercept 0 for the leading regge
trajectory (massless particles) and unphysical spacetime dimension d.

exercise xia5.1

in the derivation of the anomaly for x used for anomaly cancelation, the eect
of the p 2 term was neglected. using the result for the ht++ term from
p+  x, eliminate p from the action, and redo the anomaly calculation
in terms of this form of sl. (hint: show each step in the above calculation
is still correct, even though p and x arent independent.)

6. tree amplitudes

unlike particles, feynman diagrams for strings can be treated by rst-quantized
methods for arbitrary loops. the basic idea is that interacting strings are just strings
with nontrivial geometries: for example, while an open-string propagator can be
described by a rectangle, an open-string tree graph can be described by a rectangle
that has parallel slits cut from two opposite ends of the rectangle part-way into the
interior; this describes initial strings that join and split at their ends (interactions).
this is the lightcone picture of interactions, where conservation of total p+ means
conservation of the sum of the lengths of the strings. this corresponds to the choice
k = 1 in the language of subsection xia3, since the worldsheet coordinates must be
chosen consistently over the whole worldsheet:

x + =   l = 2p+

more general conformal gauges are dened by conformal transformations of this con-
guration: for example, the boundary of this slit rectangle can be transformed to a
single straight line by the usual methods of complex analysis, so the worldsheet be-
comes simply a half-plane. (for the innite rectangle, relevant for asymptotic states,
r ln(z  zr).) then even the geometry is irrelevant; all
that matters is the topology, which tells how many loops the diagram has. (see the
discussion of subsection viic4.)

the transformation is  =p p+

first-quantized path integrals are then the easiest way to calculate arbitrary
s-matrix elements in string theory. however, the calculations still can be quite com-
plicated (as expected from a theory with an innite number of one-particle states),
so here we will consider just the tree-level scattering of ground states, which is suf-
cient to illustrate the qualitative features. we can start from a gauge where the
string is an innite strip (a rectangle of innite length but nite width), with all
but two of the external states associated with points on one side of the strip, the
remaining two states being at the ends at innity. this is equivalent to a picture of
a propagator in an external eld, with all but two of the external states associated
with the external eld. similar calculations are possible for particles, but give only
a single graph; for strings this gives the only graph, since dierent cyclic orderings
are related by conformal transformations. (we are restricted to cyclic orderings by
group theory, as for the 1/n expansion for particles.) this method can be used in
either the lightcone gauge or lorentz covariant conformal gauge. in the latter case,
we integrate over the relative position of the vertices on the end of the string; this
0 d e h = 1/h for the propagators between vertices.
the result is the usual particle type expression v h1v...h1v . the ground-state
vertex of external momentum k is simply eikx(t,0), where the vertex is positioned at
the end of the string at  = 0.

is equivalent to integratingr 

since the functional integral is gaussian, all we need to evaluate it is the two-
dimensional propagator, subject to the boundary condition x = 0. as for 2d elec-
trostatic problems, we simplify the problem by a conformal transformation from the
innite strip to the half-plane:

z = e

where  =   i is the complex (wick-rotated worldsheet) coordinate for the strip.
the bottom of the strip ( = 0, the real axis) is mapped to the positive real axis, while
the top of the strip ( = ) is mapped to the negative real axis; the interior is mapped
to the upper-half complex plane. the 2d propagator (in worldsheet coordinate space,
needed for the explicit  = tr dependence of the vertices) now follows from that for
the whole plane by the method of images:

g(z, z) = 2(z  z)  g(z, z) = 1

2(ln|z  z| + ln|z  z*|)

(note that we have changed normalization from our earlier discussions of general
dimensions.)

thus, the n-point amplitude is given by the path integral

zr > zr+1,

z1 = ,

z2 = 1,

zn = 0

while only z3, ..., zn1 are integrated over, and vertices are inserted originally at only
z2, ..., zn1, we have inserted two extra vertices at the ends of the string at z1 and zn
(i.e.,  = ), to excite the true ground states from k = 0 to nonzero momentum
(as in ordinary quantum mechanics, where eikx|0i = |ki for p|ki = k|ki.) the extra
factor of z2

1 was inserted to amputate the external lines of these two vertices:

|ki = zeikx(z)z(

2 p2+n1)|0i = eikx(z)z2|0i

hk| = h0|z

2 p2+n1eikx(z)z = h0|eikx(z)

the extra factors of z come from the conformal transformation of this vertex
operator: conformal invariance requires that d v () = dz v (z), and it is actually
v () = zv (z) that creates an appropriately normalized state acting on |0i.

as usual, we perform the functional integral by completing the square,

s =z 1

2x x + ijx z 1

2j 1j = 1

2z z jgj

here j is a density in terms of kr and a  function; we can thus use its integration to
dene it (rather then bothering with its explicit form in terms of  functions in  or
z):

z j  x =xr

kr  x(zr)  z z j  gj =xr,s

kr  ksg(zr, zs)

(using also the fact that x and g are scalars). we drop the innite terms coming
from connecting a vertex to itself with a propagator: this is a renormalization of
the vertex, called normal ordering in the operator approach. (it can also be treated
in a more careful way by taking the vertices to correspond to nite-width strings, as
they would in the lightcone approach, and taking the limit where their widths vanish.)
the result of the functional integral is then

this limit corresponds to that treated in perturbative qcd, with large transverse en-
ergies. however, this gaussian behavior in the momentum diers from the power-law
behavior (with logarithmic corrections) found in qcd (see subsection xic3 below).

similar methods can be used for calculating closed string diagrams: the vertices
are then located anywhere on the worldshseet instead of just on the boundary, so there
are integrals over both z and z. since the closed-string hilbert space is the direct
product of two open-string hilbert spaces (except for momentum), for left- and right-
handed modes, the z-z integrands are products of two open-string integrands. there
are also generalizations to strings with worldsheet fermions; the main dierences are
supersymmetry and d=10 (instead of 26).

because of the local scale invariance of string theory, dierent string graphs are
distinguished by their topology rather than their geometry: any two graphs that can
be stretched into one another are equivalent. in particular, in any loop graph any
hole or window can be pulled out so that it appears as a tadpole. the result is that
any graph is equivalent to a tree graph with insertions of some one-loop open- or
closed-string tadpoles. however, this does not mean that any graph constructed with
only open-string propagators and interactions can be expressed as an open-string tree
graph with tadpole insertions: the one-loop open-string graph with two half-twists
on the open-string propagators in the loop is equivalent to a tree graph with a closed-
string intermediate state, as can be seen by stretching the surface, or by tracing the
routes of the boundaries. (for example, drawing this graph in a psuedo-planar way, as
a at ring with external states connected to both the inner and outer edges, pulling
the inner edge out of the plane reveals a closed string connecting the two edges.)
this phenomenon is similar to 2d bosonization: a closed string can be represented
as the bound state of two free open strings just as a massless scalar in d=2 can be
represented as the bound state of two free massless spinors.

in the previous section we looked in detail at the simplest of the string models.
in this section we examine some of the general properties of string theory, shared by
all known models, but expected to apply also to more realistic strings. these features
can be used for phenomenological applications of string theory, but also may help
point to new generalizations.

when string theory is used as a unied theory of gravity and other forces, the
most interesting predictions are those for the low-energy (with respect to the planck
mass) part of the theory. although the possible low-energy limits of known string
theories have not all been explored, the indications are that there are only a few
restrictions beyond the usual eld theoretic ones:

(1) the dilaton counts the number of loops.

(2) the spectrum of the closed string is given by the direct product of two open

strings.

(3) string theory has noncompact symmetries, s-duality and t-duality, resulting

from the amplitudes also having this direct-product structure.

all these properties survive the low-energy limit. in the supersymmetric case, the
last property follows from the rst two. (however, the d=10 superstring is actually
a d=11 supermembrane nonperturbatively. since the observed features of hadrons,
as well as qualitative arguments from qcd, indicate stringy but not membrane-
like behavior, we will abstract only the perturbative features of higher-dimensional
strings.)

1. massless spectrum

the known string models all have massless particles. a string model with massless
particles can be applied to hadrons only if masses are given to all these states through
the higgs mechanism or some other change in the vacuum. an alternative is to use
such a model to describe fundamental massless particles (graviton, photon, gluons,
neutrinos), although this would also require the usual higgs of the standard model
for generating masses for some particles (w, z, quarks, charged leptons, higgs). in
particular, all known string models have a graviton, and there is no known method
whereby this graviton would gain mass, so these models seem suited only for unied
theories of gravity plus matter. for this purpose, the massive elds have little phe-
nomenological interest. they might improve high-energy behavior, but only near the

698

xi. strings

planck scale, which is eectively unobservable. therefore, it is necessary to analyze
the massless subsector of such string theories to nd signs of fundamental strings in
nature.

the low-energy limits of the known string models follow simply from gauge in-
variance once the spectrum is known, and the spectrum itself follows from simple
considerations. in particular, we saw in subsection xia4 for the simplest model that
the massless spectrum of the closed string was simply the direct product of that of
two open strings. this is true for all known models, and is expected to be a general
feature: it is a consequence of the fact that all free massless elds in d=2 propagate
to either the left or right; the left-handed modes are associated with one open-string
factor, the right-handed with the other.
in general, the two factors may be from
dierent open-string theories.

the massless sector of the open string includes spin 1 and no higher. this is
true for the known string models, and also is expected to be a general result, since
otherwise the closed string would include massless states with spin higher than 2, for
which no consistent interacting theory is known. spin 1/2 leads to supersymmetry,
as described in subsection xib3 below; for now we limit ourselves to bosonic strings.

for the spin-1 particles to obtain nontrivial self-interactions (yang-mills), we need
to introduce internal symmetry. this is naturally introduced by associating indices
with the ends of the open string (as if they were quarks), as applied to particle
eld theory in subsection vc9 (but which originated in string theory). these chan-
paton factors can also be associated with worldsheet variables that live only on string
boundaries. as in the eld theory case, these indices are associated with orientation
of the boundaries (arrows) only for u groups, not for so or usp. (exceptional groups
cannot be described by chan-paton factors.)

the bosonic string contains at least the graviton, a scalar (usually going by the
misnomer of dilaton), and a pseudoscalar (the axion, described by an antisym-
metric-tensor gauge eld), and can contain additional vectors and scalars (if the
open strings had scalars in addition to the vector). this analysis can be performed
covariantly, but it is simpler to use a helicity or lightcone analysis. then the helicities
of the closed-string states are just the sums of those of the open strings: for the
product of two vectors (the minimal case),

(+1  1)  (+1  1) = +2  0  0  2

giving the graviton, scalar, and axion. similarly, additional scalars for one open string
give additional vectors for the closed, while additional scalars for both open strings
give also additional scalars.

make the same analysis in terms of covariant elds, both for the elds them-
selves and their gauge transformations. note that the trace of the gravita-
tional eld hab (determinant of the metric gmn) is missing. (its unphysical,
and can be found from the ghost sector, as explained in chapter xii.)

2. reality and orientation

in the case that the two open strings are the same, it is possible to restrict this
direct product to its symmetric part. this eliminates the axion, but not the scalar.
thus, a massless scalar appears even in the simplest case.

to understand this restriction better, we examine the discrete symmetries of the
worldsheet. as in d=4, local, unitary, poincare invariant 2d eld theories are always
cpt invariant. (in particular, cpt doesnt switch left- and right-handed modes,
which dier in some string theories.) thus, we can always impose invariance of the
wave function/eld under the worldsheet cpt transformation

worldsheet cp t :

[x()] = [x(  )]

where parity transforms      to preserve [0, ] for the open string; for
the closed string the  is irrelevant because of periodicity and invariance under 
translation. (as for the particle, we drop  dependence. we have written only the
x coordinate explicitly for simplicity; similar remarks apply to other coordinates,
such as ghosts, with possible extra signs due to 2d lorentz indices.) hermitian
conjugation for the open string (for the closed string the eld is not a matrix), instead
of just complex conjugation (for c), simply switches the internal symmetry (chan-
paton) factors associated with the left and right ends of the open string (matrix
transposition), as also required by parity. in particular, this implies that the matrices
associated with the yang-mills elds are hermitian, so the yang-mills group is unitary.

in addition to this reality condition, if the 2d theory is also invariant under cp
and t, it is also possible, though not necessarily required, to impose such a quantum
mechanical invariance under cp, and thus t:

worldsheet t :

worldsheet cp :

[x()] = m*[x()]m1 
[x()] = mt [x(  )]m1

where the matrix m is the yang-mills group metric for the open string (we drop
the m and the t for the closed string, which is not a matrix), either symmetric or

700

xi. strings

antisymmetric depending on whether the group is orthogonal or symplectic; without
imposing t and cp the group is just unitary. (the t condition is the usual reality
condition for the particle, as discussed in subsection ia5.) thus, all the classical
groups are allowed (at least in the classical eld theory). since imposing invariance
of the states (not just the action) under cp and t makes it impossible to observe the
left/right handedness of the worldsheet, such strings are unoriented, as opposed to
the oriented strings that satisfy just the cpt condition. thus, orientability of the
surface is directly related to orientability of its boundaries (oriented for u, unoriented
for so or usp). also, as in the particle eld theory, unorientability allows twisted
worldsheets that are prohibited in the oriented case (because we can distinguish the
front of the worldsheet from the back): this allows such exotic geometries as
mobius strips and klein bottles. open strings produce closed ones as bound states
(open and closed strings are parts of the same worldsheet with dierent boundaries);
in theories of open and closed strings, they must be both oriented or both unoriented.
since the worldsheet-cp and -t switch lefty and righty modes, this invariance on the
closed string results in the restriction introduced earlier, keeping only the symmetric
part of the direct product.

exercise xib2.1

what is the dierence between an unoriented closed string (satisfying this
worldsheet cp condition) and the interpretation of subsection xib3 of the
open string as a closed string folded over on itself?

3. supergravity

again focusing on just the massless spectrum, we now look at the restrictions
imposed by supersymmetry. the open string can also contain massless spin 1/2,
but only if it is related by supersymmetry to its massless spin 1, since it leads to
spin 3/2 in the closed string, and massless spin 3/2 is known to be inconsistent in an
interacting theory unless related by supersymmetry to the graviton. (spin 3/2 gauges
supersymmetry. but spin 1 cant couple minimally to spin 3/2: see exercise xiib7.2b
below. so, spin 3/2 needs spin 2 as its supersymmetric partner.) thus there are
two possibilities for the massless sector of each open string: (1) vectors and scalars
for an open bosonic string, or (2) vector multiplets (vectors, spinors, and scalars,
all related by some number of supersymmetries) for an open superstring. from our
analysis of subsection iic5, there are furthermore 3 types of vector multiplets in d=4,
corresponding to n=1,2, or 4 supersymmetries.

this leads to four types of closed strings:

b. symmetries

701

(1) the bosonic string, from bosonic  bosonic, was discussed in subsection xib1.
(2) the heterotic string, comes from bosonic  super. it thus can have n=1,2, or

4 supersymmetries.

(3) the (type ii) superstring comes from super  super. the total number of its
supersymmetries is the sum of those from the open strings: depending on the type
of supersymmetric open strings used, the superstring can have n=2,3,4,5,6, or 8
(in other words, anything greater than 1, since n=7 supersymmetry is equivalent
to n=8, and 8 is the maximum for supergravity).

(4) in the super case, if the left and right open strings are the same, we can impose
symmetry as in the bosonic case (type i). then we may also include the open
strings in the spectrum: this symmetrization also identies the left and right
supersymmetries, so then n=1,2 or 4, the same for open and closed states (so
they can be consistently coupled).

the spectrum again can be analyzed by helicity: for example, for the n=1 het-

erotic string, we have

(1  1

2   1

2  1)  (1  1) = (2  3

2   3

2  2)  ( 1

2  0  0   1
2)

which is supergravity plus a scalar multiplet. as for the bosonic string, all supersym-
metric closed strings include the scalar, again coming from vector  vector.

exercise xib3.1

make the same analysis for the superstring.

4. t-duality

another symmetry of all known string models is t-duality. it is closely related
to the open  open structure of closed string states, and thus expected to be a general
property of string theory. we consider the simple bosonic model as an example.
including constant background elds, working in the conformal gauge for convenience,
the lagrangian is

l = (+x m)(x n)mmn,

mmn = gmn + bmn

where the curved indices now refer to spacetime, gmn is the spacetime metric, and
bmn is an antisymmetric tensor gauge eld (axion). writing the action in rst-order
form

l = p+mx m  pm+x m + p+mpnm mn

702

xi. strings

where m mn is the inverse of mmn, we vary x instead of p to solve the eld equation

+pm + p+m = 0  p+m = + xm, pm = 

xm

and substitute to nd the dual lagrangian

l = (+ xm)(

xn)m mn

thus the duality transformation from x to x is an invariance of the theory,

as long as we also transform the background:

x m  xm,

mmn  m mn

note that in at space (m mn = mn), using the p equation of motion in l, we have

p+m = mn+x n,

pm = mnx n

x) while
so duality just changes the sign of the right-handed modes (x = 
leaving invariant the left-handed ones (+x = + x). (the treatment of the zero-
modes is more tricky: we have ignored them by taking the background constant.)
we can see this to lowest order in the background, since m  m1, to lowest
order in perturbation about hmi = , changes the sign of the eld, corresponding to
the fact that their vertex operators are linear in both left- and right-handed modes
((+x)(x)). however, in full nonlinearity, duality mixes the spacetime metric
gmn(x) and axion bmn(x).

this invariance can be generalized to a continuous o(d,d) symmetry by com-
bining it with (global) lorentz transformations. the above discrete symmetry is a
kind of parity for this larger group: there are also reections from performing
the duality on just one component of x m. the easiest way to see the full symmetry
is in the hamiltonian formalism, where it can be made manifest: we rst combine
xm and the canonical momentum pm into an o(d,d) vector:

zm = (pm, xm)

 [zm (1), zn (2)] = i(2  1)m n ,

m n =(cid:18) 0

m
n

n
m

0 (cid:19)

where the o(d,d) metric m n is constant even in curved space. (we have abbreviated
1 for 1, etc.) the virasoro constraints are then

1

2m n zm zn = 1

2m m n zm zn = 0

b. symmetries

703

where m is not only symmetric but also an element of the o(d,d) group:

m m n =(cid:18) gmn

bmpgpn gmn  bmpgpqbqn(cid:19) = m n m = m p (m1)p qqn

gmpbpn

if the elds are constant in only d of the d dimensions, than the symmetry is re-
duced to o(d,d); thus o(d,d) is a symmetry of the dimensionally reduced theory
with arbitrary elds.

exercise xib4.1

on e, so e is an element of the coset space o(d,d)/o(d1,1)o(d1,1)
(see subsection iva3).

5. dilaton

we can extend the spectrum analysis o shell: the procedure (to be justied in
chapter xii) includes the ghost and antighost (multiplets) for the vector (multiplet)
as a doublet of the ghostly sp(2) symmetry. the direct product of vector  vector
now clearly gives a traceless symmetric tensor (graviton), the corresponding trace
(physical scalar), and an antisymmetric tensor (axion). in the direct product of the
ghosts, the sp(2) singlet gives the trace part of the metric tensor, which is the true
dilaton. this dilaton (the determinant of the metric tensor in the nonlinear case)
is required in gravity for constructing local actions (see subsection ixa7), but does
not contain a physical degree of freedom. the physical polarizations of the graviton
are contained in the traceless (actually det = 1) part of the metric, which describes
the conformal part of gravity. the direct products involving ghosts also give sp(2)
nonsinglets, which are the ghosts of the massless sector of the closed string. brst
transformations (and thus gauge transformations) can also be obtained by this direct-
product procedure.

the natural coupling of background elds in the classical mechanics of the string
reects this direct-product structure, as seen in the previous subsection. this means
that the background metric as we have dened it has as its determinant not the usual

704

xi. strings

one, but that times a power of the physical scalar: it is a physical degree of freedom.
t-duality mixes physical degrees of freedom with each other.

if we try to construct a low-energy action for the massless elds of the bosonic
string, it is not too dicult to nd a scalar invariant under t-duality to act as the

lagrangian. however, it is impossible to use the usual measurer dx g because g

is not invariant under t-duality. this problem is solved by including the spacetime
dilaton eld (x): it couples to the string as

sdil = z d2

2

g 1

2r ln (x)

where we denote the worldsheet curvature by r() (only in this subsection) to distin-
guish it from the spacetime curvature r(x). (there are also boundary contributions:
see exercise ixa7.3.) this term can also be expressed as a coupling to the world-
sheet ghosts (according to the above arguments), allowing the worldsheet metric to
be completely xed by gauge transformations, as usual.

since there is no x dependence of sdil for constant dilaton eld (no x factors,
unlike g and b), the constant dilaton is invariant under t-duality. furthermore, since
it couples to the worldsheet curvature, which counts the number of loops, the dilaton
must appear homogeneously in the classical action. the dilaton that appears as above
in the string action transforms as a density under general coordinate transformations,
allowing the construction of actions invariant under both t-duality and coordinate
transformations. the resulting spacetime action is

smassless =z dx (  1

4r + 1

24 h abchabc + )

where habc = 1
2[abbc] is the eld strength for the axion. t-duality determines
the only arbitrary coecient, the relative weight of the
and r terms. note the
absence of the factor e1, which has been absorbed into the denition of : the
covariant derivative acting on , since it is a density that transforms as e1/2, acts
as a = e1/2eae1/2.

ea

m  rab = 2ab

24h 2 +  = 0

both coupling constants in string theory can be associated with vacuum values:
(1) the string coupling appears as the vacuum value of the dilaton, since it counts
loops. (2)  comes from the vacuum value of the (spacetime) metric, as can be seen
from the worldsheet action. this is the string-gauge equivalent of the fact that the
gravitational constant naturally arises as the vacuum (or asymptotic) value of the
metric in ordinary gravity (see subsection ixa5). in string theory, the fact that the
gravitational constant is a combination of  and the string coupling is equivalent to
the eld redenition from the string gauge to the particular weyl gauge where the
einstein term in the action appears in the usual way.

we can no longer choose the gauge + = 1, since it is now scale invariant,
but we can still choose  = 1.

6. superdilaton

when applied to the supersymmetric cases (superstring or heterotic string), the
inclusion of ghosts in the direct-product procedure also gives the auxiliary elds.
(the dilaton itself is an auxiliary eld.) for example, in the heterotic case, the
direct product of the physical parts of the vector and vector multiplet give conformal
supergravity (the supersymmetrization of the traceless part of the metric) and a
physical tensor multiplet (the supersymmetrization of the axion and scalar). on the
other hand, the ghosts of the vector multiplet form a chiral scalar supereld; its
procuct with the scalar ghost of the vector gives another chiral scalar supereld, the
compensator, containing the dilaton. (see chapter x.)

3

the two conditions of supersymmetry and that the dilaton must appear homoge-
neously (quadratically after an appropriate eld redenition) are now enough to x
the form of the action (except for the nonminimal heterotic cases, where the open
strings scalars introduce extra vector multiplets). for convenience we redene the
chiral scalar compensator as   2/3 so that it appears quadratically in the cos-

mological termr d4x d2 2. thus, by dimensional analysis  now has scale weight
2. the axial-vector eld strength of the axion appears as [, .]g, so g has scale
weight 2. (gauge elds are weyl scale invariant with curved indices for consistency
with gauge transformations; thus hmnp has weight 0 while habc has weight 3.) of
course, these weights also follow from local superscale transformations, the global part
of which transforms elds as l2w (see subsection xa4). the only action quadratic
in the dilaton consistent with global scale and u(1) (r) invariance is then (with
implicit covariantization with respect to conformal supergravity, which makes these
invariances local)

s =z dx d4 g1/2 +(cid:18)z dx d2 2 + h.c.(cid:19)

exercise xib6.1

use the methods of subsection xb6 to nd all of the terms in this action
involving only bosonic elds. compare to the bosonic string action of the
previous subsection.

besides t-duality, string theories also have s-duality symmetries that are re-
alized only on the eld equations, or after performing electromagnetic-type duality

b. symmetries

707

transformations on the elds: if we convert g into a second, physical chiral multiplet
 by such a duality as described in subsection xb5, the above action is converted to

s =z dx d4 ( )2/3( + )1/3 +(cid:18)z dx d2 2 + h.c.(cid:19)

after the redenitions

2  ,

2  

the rst term becomes manifestly su(1,1) invariant (see subsection xb7):

s =z dx d4 (  + )1/3 +(cid:18)z dx d2  + h.c.(cid:19)

it is now the original t-duality that can be realized only on shell. also, in this form
the condition that the dilaton should appear homogeneously is obscured. (such s-
dualities were rst seen in extended supergravity theories, especially when obtained by
reduction from higher dimensions, where antisymmetric tensors are often required.)

exercise xib6.2

apply the results of exercise xb5.1 to include vector multiplets in the above
actions by replacing g  g in the rst action and performing duality trans-
formations. (the super yang-mills appears in the spectrum from the product
(vector  scalars)  vector multiplet in the heterotic string.) this substi-
tution is dictated by homogeneity in the dilaton, which prevents the usual

conformalr d2 w 2 term. such terms occur naturally in higher-dimensional

couplings of supergravity to super yang-mills.

classical and quantum symmetries of mechanics formulations of particle and
string theories in background elds are often used to derive equations for those back-
grounds. these features are not peculiar to these theories or their formulations: they
are a general feature of describing a particle/eld of some (super)spin in a gauge back-
ground. these equations fall into two distinct types: (1) a supersymmetric system
in a gauge background of higher superspin generates constraints on the background,
necessary for consistently dening the coupling (see subsections ivc4 and xa1). (2)
any gauge system in a background of the same gauge eld generates eld equations
for the background (see exercise vib8.2).

for example, the classical symmetries of the superparticle always generate con-
straints on its background, but give eld equations for it only if the number of super-
symmetries is enough to insure its superspin is as high as that of its background (e.g.,
10d n=1 in background super yang-mills or 11d n=1 in background supergravity).
similarly, the bosonic string generates eld equations for background gravity at the

708

xi. strings

quantum mechanical level because quantization is required to reveal the massless

graviton excited state contained in the string itself. on the other hand, the 10d

superstring already generates eld equations for background supergravity classically,

since the ground state of the superstring (closed if boundary conditions are ignored),

the only part that is evident (semi)classically, already contains supergravity.

7. conformal eld theory

we saw in subsections viiia7-8 some unusual features of massless theories in

d=2. since the mechanics of the string is mathematically equivalent to 2d eld

theory (as the mechanics of the particle is to 1d eld theory), we now examine such

eld theories in a little more detail.

in particular, since the string we studied in

section xia possessed local weyl scale invariance on the worldsheet, we are directed

to 2d conformal eld theories coupled to 2d gravity.

since for the most part we will be interested in free elds, quantization will be

described most easily by the path-integral method. although 2d eld theory already

looks quite dierent from the 1d eld theory of particle mechanics, free 2d massless
elds depend on only one of the two lightcone coordinates  (or are the sum of
two such terms), and hence 2d conformal eld theory is similar to 1d massive eld

theory. consequently some of the features of particle mechanics or nonrelativistic

eld theory, such as the commutator, can still be useful and 2d lorentz covariant.

in particle mechanics, the (equal-time) commutator is evaluated by path-integral

methods as

h[a,b](t)i  lim

0ha(t + )b(t)  b(t + )a(t)i

(and similarly for the anticommutator), since a and b are treated as classical func-
tions when evaluating the path integral

hfi z d f eis

where now h i refers not to just the vacuum expectation value, but incorporates
arbitrary initial and nal states through the boundary conditions, or explicit wave

functions in the path integral (see subsections va1, xia6). in general, this denition
of h i actually gives the time-ordered expectation value, as follows from the derivation
of subsection va1: the s were introduced to enforce the appropriate ordering. for

the rest of this subsection time ordering will be implicit in expectation values.

b. symmetries

709

for simplicity, we assume the worldsheet boundary is at innity; this can be
achieved by conformal (coordinate) transformation (z = e on the euclidean world-
sheet: see subsection xia6), or we can look at just short-distance eects. the upper-
half plane, for the open string, can be completed into the full plane, as describes the
closed string, by extending the open string to have closed-string boundary conditions,
but with half as many elds, as described in subsection xia3: in the following we
consider only elds that are left- or right-handed (functions on-shell of only + or
, as x() or p()), which are always dened on the whole worldsheet (or, before
conformal transformation, periodic on the cylinder).

the simplest example is the 2d spinor. from subsection viiia7, we have

h (m)(m)i =

i

(  )  i(  )h1i + ...

(not summed over ) or in operator notation simply

(m)(m) =

(  )  i(  )

i

+ ...

where ... means terms that are nite in the limit   , resulting from propagators
that extend not between these two fermions, but between either one and the initial
or nal wave function. using the identity (see exercise va3.1)

we then have the usual

i

x + i 

i

x  i

= 2(x)

{ (), ()} = 2(  )

normally, this would taken at equal  , but in 2d conformal eld theory, since the
elds time-dependence is given by their depending on just + or just , and since
even interacting string calculations in terms of these free (with respect to rst-
quantization) 2d elds factorizes into two separate calculations for the left-handed
elds and for the right-handed elds, we generally treat just + or just  as the only
argument. (after wick rotation, this becomes just the complex variable z or just z.)

this limiting procedure can be avoided when evaluating commutators of -inte-
grated quantities, such as conserved charges: since such surface integrals in d=2
are basically contour integrals (see exercise iia1.2c), a commutator of the form

(cid:20)z d

2

() (), ()(cid:21) = ()

(now dropping the  index) for some anticommuting function , which by the above
denition is the integral over the dierence of two contours, becomes the integral over

710

xi. strings

a closed contour surrounding , directly picking up the contribution from the pole
in    (see exercise va3.1b).

one unusual consequence of 2d massless eld theory is bosonization. in subsec-
tion viiia7 we saw from propagators that the usual massless scalar  = (+) + ()
can be used to construct fermions as  = ei(),  = ei(). from the above argu-
ments this implies the usual anticommutation relations. (note that such commutators
are completely quantum mechanical and not merely semiclassical: the calculation of
subsection viiia7 involved multiloop diagrams with arbitrary numbers of propaga-
tors of scalars, whereas poisson brackets eectively use only a single propagator of a
fundamental eld.)

as a further check of this equivalence we now examine their conformal transfor-

mations. the commutator of the scalar conformal generators

t = 1

2()2 = 1

2(())2

with that scalar follows from a single propagator (see subsection viiia7):

()(m)()(m) = ln[i(  )] + ...
 [()(m)]()(m) = 

1

+ ...

  

 [()(1), ()(2)] = i2(1  2)

(again dropping the  on , using 1 for 1, etc.), conrming that  is canonically
conjugate to . we then nd

[t(1), ()(2)] = i2(1  2)()(2),

[t, ()] = 0

similarly, for the composite fermion we nd

[()(m)]eia()(m) = 

ia

  

eia()(m) + ...

 [()(1), (2)] = 2(1  2) (2),
[()(1), (2)] = 2(1  2)(2)

in agreement with the identication () = . then the product with t gives
two factors of 1/(  ) for the most singular term, as well as a less-singular term
from connecting a propagator to either  (but not both):

1

2(cid:18)
2()2(m)eia(m) =  1

  (cid:19)2

b. symmetries

711

where we have used

[ia(m)]eia(m) =(cid:16)eia(m)(cid:17) + o(  )

the nal result is thus:

[t(1), (2)] = i2(2  1)(2)  i(2  1)(2),

[t, ] = 0

these results generalize easily to general linear exponentials for multiple scalars:

including an indenite metric

h0|i()(m)j()(m)|0i = ij[i ln(  )]

we have

eia()(m)eib()(m) = [i(  )]abeia()(m)+ib()(m) + ...

as the most singular contribution to the path integral, using the same method as in
subsection viiia7, where indices are raised and lowered with ij, as usual. further-
more, we can generalize the conformal generators with a linear term, as results from
a 1

2 rii term in the action:

l = 1

4ij(i)  (j) + 1

2 rii  t = 1

2ij(i())(j())  i2


i()

its commutators then generalize, for any covariant elds , as

(cid:20)iz d

()t(), ()(cid:21) = ()() + w()()()
[t(1), (2)] = (2  1)(2) + w()(2  1)(2)

where w() are the conformal weights: w(+) + w() is the usual conformal weight,
while w(+)  w() is the spin. for the elds eia() we then nd

w()(a) = 1

2a2 + i  a,

w() = 0

in particular, for  = 0 we see that  has w() = 1
weight w() = 0.

2, while () is covariant with

exercise xib7.1

use the result for eiaeib to derive  = () (up to an innite constant),
dening the equal-time product as a limit, as above.

exercise xib7.2

the i  a term in w is classical, since it comes from a single propagator:

712

xi. strings

a derive the above lagrangian for a single scalar by starting with the nonlocal
term r(1/ )r and applying a local weyl scale transformation, introducing
the scalar as the compensator.

b find the classical scale weight of eia from its local scale transformation.
(hint: in deriving the local scale transformation in part a, an exponential
will be needed, so that e transforms homogeneously.)

the most important use of such exponentials, outside of bosonization, is in the
use of external elds (or vertex operators): the conformal generators (energy-
momentum tensor) have conformal weight 2; requiring that background elds preserve
conformal invariance implies that such vertex operators must have conformal weight
1 and be local on the worldsheet:

i

1
2

[ t(1), t(2)] = (2  1)[ t(1) + t(2)]

t() = t() +fw ()  fw has w = 1,
 fw () = 2(  0)w (0)

[fw (),fw ()] = 0

where we have assumed the conformal anomaly cancels (or ignored its contribution),
and solved for closure of the algebra perturbatively in the background.

if we write a background spacetime eld (x(m)) as a fourier transform, then
we see that its conformal weight is proportional to k2, the square of the external
momentum. hence a vertex operator consisting of just a scalar eld produces the
tachyonic ground state. excited states are created by products of derivatives of x
times elds (with spacetime lorentz indices contracted); the derivatives add to the
conformal weight, forcing k2 to decrease in compensation, resulting in massless and
massive (m2 > 0) states.

8. triality

bosonization can also be applied to representations of groups (lorentz or inter-
nal). in particular, to obtain the correct anticommutation relations for a fermion eia
and its conjugate eia we require a2 = 1. their weights are then 1
2  i  a. the
simplest choice to obtain 2n fermions from n scalars is, for ij = ij, in a (complex)
null basis for so(2n),

so(2n) vector :

ai
v = (1, 0, 0, ...), (0,1, 0, ...), ...

klein factors should be included to make fermions using dierent scalars anticom-
mute (see subsection ia2). this construction follows that for the dirac matrices in

b. symmetries

713

subsection xc1: each scalar corresponds to a 2d subspace of so(2n), and each com-
ponent of a d-vector ai is the corresponding eigenvalue of the 2d spin. from that
construction we see that spinors should be

so(2n) spinors :

ai
s,s = ( 1

2 , 1

2, ...)

with independent s, with the product of all of them equal to 1 for one weyl spinor
and 1 for the other. (the conventions are slightly dierent from subsection xc1:
now we use a representation where 3 is diagonal, and 1 is chosen as the last .)
however, the resulting operators have the correct anticommutation relations and
conformal weights only for so(8) (n = 4), corresponding to the lightcone symmetry
for the 10d superstring. this follows from the triality symmetry between the vector
and two spinors: by simply changing the scalar-eld basis so that the as for one of
the spinors are  the basis elements, the as for the vector and the other spinor take
the same form as above for the two spinors (i.e., the above expressions for the vector
and spinor as are permuted).

similar triality constructions apply to lower dimensions by taking into account
supersymmetry, which also relates a vector to a spinor. in d=6, simple supersym-
metry has an internal su(2) (r) symmetry: thus, there is a triality relating this
su(2) to the two su(2)s of the lightcones so(4). in terms of these, the vector is
the ( 1
2 ). the resulting
operators are given by

2, 0) representation, while the spinors are ( 1

this also follows directly from the so(8) result by dropping the third and fourth

scalars for the vector, and using only (1/2) their sum for the spinors. (i.e., it

represents only internal symmetry.) for d=4 the construction is even simpler: besides
the so(2)=u(1) of the lightcone, there is a second u(1) for r symmetry. in terms of
the complex plane dened by these two quantum numbers, there is an obvious triality
for the three cube roots of 1; thus

av = (1, 0),

as = ( 1
2 ,

3
2 ),

as = ( 1

which again also follows from so(8), now combining its last 3 scalars.

exercise xib8.1

we now extend the analogy to the construction of subsection xc1:

a show for general so(2n), in analogy to the dirac s, that the (integral of)
products of two vector fermions, antisymmetrized in the vector indices, act in
the same way as the group generators, by examining their commutators with
each other and with the vector and spinor operators.

b show for the triality cases that the (anti)commutator of two representations

yields the third (supersymmetry).

these constructions can be generalized from the lightcone to manifest lorentz
covariance by adding equal numbers of scalars of positive and negative metric (at
least one of each): their contributions to the spinors operator product (power of
) then cancel, preserving the anticommutation relations. one of the extra scalars
of positive metric yields the two longitudinal spacetime directions to complete the
so(d2) vector and spinor representations to so(d1,1). the rest of the scalars
come from ghosts. note that the spacetime metric is unrelated to the metric for the
scalars: the minkowski spacetime metric comes from wick rotation of the scalars, as
applied in subsection xc2 to the construction of subsection xc1 for dirac spinors.
for either euclidean or minkowski spacetime the basis is null; the only dierence is
in reality.

integrals are dened as limits of sums. for some cases it can be convenient to
dene quantum theories on discrete spacetimes (lattices), perform all calculations
there, and then take the limit of continuous spacetime. two types of such lattices
will be considered here: (1) physical four-dimensional spacetime can be treated as a
regular hypercubic lattice. then the existence and uniqueness of a continuum limit
where lorentz invariance is restored must be proven.
(2) in rst-quantization of
particles or strings, the worldline or worldsheet can be approximated as a random
lattice. integration over the metric of the worldline or worldsheet is then replaced
with summation over lattices with dierent geometries. the continuum limit is not
required by physical criteria, but only for purposes of comparison to the theory as
dened in the continuum.

1. spacetime lattice

the use of a regular 4d lattice for quantizing qcd has three main advantages:

(1) the lattice acts as a gauge invariant regulator for uv divergences (and, if the

lattice is nite, also ir ones).

(2) gauge xing is no longer necessary, since the path integral can be performed

without it.

(3) nonperturbative calculations are possible, some analytically and some numeri-

cally (if the lattice is small enough).

gauge elds are associated with translations through the covariant derivative.
however, on a lattice, even a regular one, innitesimal translations are no longer
possible: for example, scalar elds are dened only at vertices of the lattice. we
therefore consider covariantizing nite translations, as in subsections iiia5 and iiic2,

ekmm = p(cid:20)exp(cid:18)iz x

xk

dx  a(cid:19)(cid:21) ek = ux,xkek

without loss of generality, we can restrict ourselves to translations along links, from
one vertex straight to an adjacent one (keeping all coordinates but one constant),
and successive combinations of these. then the gauge eld is replaced with the group
element ux,xk associated with each link, where k is now any of the 4 orthonormal
basis vectors (in euclidean space). the gauge transformation of this representation
of the gauge eld follows from either the path-ordered denition or the covariant-
translation denition:

ek(x)

= g(x)ekg1(x)  ux,xk = g(x)ux,xkg1(x  k)

718

xi. strings

note that, while the gauge eld is a group element associated with a link, the gauge
transformation is a group element associated with a vertex. furthermore, the eld
strength can be associated with the product of these group elements of the links
bounding a plaquet:

ux,xkuxk,xkkuxkk,xkuxk,x = p(cid:16)eih dxa(cid:17) = ekekekek

 e[k,k]  1 + ikakbfab

where we have used

ebec = eb+c+

1
2 [b,c]+...

(in general, there is a geometric prescription associating a scalar with a point, a vector
with a line, a second-rank antisymmetric tensor with a surface, etc.)

we now dene a gauge-invariant action by looking for an expression in terms of
these group elements that approximates the usual yang-mills action to lowest order in
the lattice spacing, while involving the least number of factors of the group elements.
the result is:

s =  1

g2 tr xplaquets

(ux,xkuxk,xkkuxkk,xkuxk,x  1)

  1

g2 tr xplaquets

1

2 (ikakbfab)2  1

g2 trxx

f 2(x)

(expanding the exponential as above to quadratic order, and noting that total commu-
tators vanish when traced). since our elds are now represented by group elements,
we no longer need to x the gauge to make the functional path integral well dened:
in contrast to the continuum case, where integrating a gauge-invariant action over
gauge transformations would produce an innite factor, here such an integral at any
one point is just an integral over the group space, which is nite (for compact groups,
which have nite volume). the functional integration is now integration over u for
each link, where the range of u is the group space (which is nite, since the group is
compact).

matter can also be introduced: scalars are naturally associated with vertices,
just as vectors are with links, and second-rank antisymmetric tensors with plaquets.
however, fermions do not have such a natural geometric interpretation. in particular,
it has been proven (the nielsen-ninomiya theorem) that massless fermions cant be
dened in a useful way on the lattice without fermion doubling: there must be a
multiple of 2d massless fermion elds for d lattice dimensions. this is closely related
to the existence of axial anomalies: the absence of an anomaly is implied by the

c. lattices

719

existence of a regularization that manifestly preserves a symmetry (in this case, chiral
symmetry as a consequence of the existence of lattice-regularized fermions). however,
massless fermions can be dened as limits of massive ones (so chiral invariance is not
manifest). alternatively, nonlocal spinor kinetic operators can be found that preserve
masslessness and chirality without doubling. (the nonlocality can be controlled, but
at the cost of a signicantly more complicated action.)

exercise xic1.2

in the book by feynman and hibbs, exercise 2-6 states rules for the path
integral for a dirac spinor in d=2. these rules are equivalent to the use of
a lightlike lattice, where the lightcone coordinates are discretized. the rules
are to consider all paths that are piecewise lightlike forward in time, with a
factor of im for each right-angle kink (where m is the mass and  the lattice
spacing). show these rules follow from the 2d action for a dirac spinor (see
subsection viiia7, and include a mass term), using a term as in the previous
exercise for the derivative term for each of the two component elds (each of
which has a derivative in only one of the two lightlike coordinates).

in general, fermions are more dicult to integrate over, particularly when using
numerical methods (computers), since fermions are not numbers. in principle one
can integrate out the fermions analytically to produce functional determinants in
terms of bosonic elds, but nonlocality makes them hard to evaluate by iterative

720

xi. strings

schemes. in practice fermion loops are usually ignored (quenched approximation),
which corresponds to leading order in an expansion in the inverse of the number
of avors, or the approximation of heavy quarks. the resulting accuracy of qcd
calculations for low-energy parameters (masses of light hadrons, decay constants, etc.)
is of the order of 5-10%. (getting good numbers in nonperturbative calculations is
signicantly harder than in perturbative ones. the situation is expected to improve
somewhat with the advent of faster computers.) finding scattering amplitudes, or
other properties that involve high-mass hadrons, is presently beyond the scope of
lattice methods. however, lattice qcd is one of the few methods so far to obtain
numbers for comparison with experiment from nonperturbative calculations with the
qcd action. (other nonperturbative methods have also been restricted to low-mass
hadrons, and basically study eects of chiral symmetry breaking, not connement.)

the spacetime lattice allows a direct nonperturbative analysis of connement.
for example, consider the potential between a heavy quark-antiquark pair. the
heaviness again allows us to ignore pair creation, and to treat the quarks as static.
for simplicity, consider scalar quarks, as described by rst-quantization. since we
approximate the quarks as static, the only relevant term in the quark mechanics action

nature of the group, and ignoring the rst-quantized path integration dx (since x is
assumed xed), the factor es for the quark becomes just the path-ordered expression

x  a = r dx  a. taking into account the nonabelian
is the interaction term r d
p(eir dxa) we have been considering, while for the antiquark we get the inverse

expression. to get a gauge-invariant expression, we connect the paths at top and
bottom, since the elds will be xed at the boundaries at t = .
(functional
integration over any gauge-eld link picks out just the singlet part of the integrand,
since the integral is over the group, and nonsinglet representations can be rotated to
minus themselves by an appropriate group element, canceling the contribution.) the
result is a wilson loop

tr p(cid:16)eih dxa(cid:17)

the strong-coupling expansion is applied by expanding the functional integrand
es in powers of s, which is an expansion in powers of 1/g2, and which is also an ex-
pansion in the number of plaquets. clearly the dominant term in this expansion is the
one with the fewest factors of s. to be nonvanishing, each link variable must appear
in a singlet combination: the function of that link, when expanded in irreducible
group representations, must include a term that is proportional to the identity. for
l, where the two

us are for the same link, and the indices are the group indices; this has the constant

i. for the case of the wilson loop, if we assume the simplest case
piece ui
where the path is a rectangle, then we need at least a factor of s for each plaquet
enclosed by the loop, so there will a uu1 for each link on the boundary (one factor
from the loop, one from s), as well as for each link enclosed by it (both factors from
the contribution to s from either side). the result for the path integral is then

a =dtr p(cid:16)eih dxa(cid:17)e  ev t (cid:18) 1
g2(cid:19)rt

where v is the (potential) energy (s = r dt(v + t ) in euclidean space), t is the

time separation between the top and bottom of the rectangle, and r is the spatial
separation between the two sides. we thus have a linear quark-antiquark potential

so the quark-antiquark pair is conned.

v (r)  (ln g)r

unfortunately, we can get a similar result from qed, by dening the u(1) group
in terms of a phase factor (so eectively the range of group integration is 2, dening
a compact group). the reason is that for this u(1) theory this strong coupling
expansion is not accurate. the approximation is better for nonabelian theories, but
the persistence of connement has not been proven in the continuum limit (small
coupling). in fact, while the transition to deconnement in abelian theories has been
found at nite coupling, it has been proven that such a phenomenon can occur in the
nonabelian theory only near zero coupling. however, the perturbative properties of
the continuum theory show that this is exactly where one expects the appearance of
ambiguities in the theory (known in lattice terminology as nonuniversality); this
is directly related to the ambiguities in the borel transform discussed in subsection
viic3.

2. worldsheet lattice

in string theory there are two spaces, the two-dimensional space of the world-
sheet, and physical spacetime. in the previous subsection we considered approximat-
ing spacetime by a lattice; in this subsection we instead approximate the worldsheet
by lattices. for the spacetime of qcd we used a regular lattice, representing the
xed geometry of at spacetime. in string theory we considered worldsheets of ar-
bitrary geometry, described by a worldsheet metric, so our lattices should be more
arbitrary; in fact, functional integration over the worldsheet metric must be replaced
by summation over dierent lattices. we saw that the topological expansion of qcd

722

xi. strings

in 1/n generated polyhedra analogous to the worldsheet, with 1/n acting as the
string coupling. we therefore identify the feynman diagrams themselves, with faces
chosen by the 1/n expansion, as these lattices, to give a more precise correlation
between the second-quantized path integral of qcd (and other eld theories) and
the rst-quantized path integral of string theory.

presently the relation between such eld theories and string theory is not well
understood, and has been described only for the bosonic string. since the bosonic
string has only the worldsheet metric and spacetime coordinates as degrees of free-
dom, it corresponds to a (nn-matrix) scalar eld theory. since a lattice requires a
scale, while conformal invariance includes scale invariance, we must break the confor-
mal invariance of the worldsheet. the simplest coordinate-invariant yet scale-variant
property of a space is its volume, so we add a volume (area) term to the string action.
furthermore, to describe interactions we need to include a term containing the string
coupling constant. in string theory the coupling is topological, in the sense that the
power of the coupling constant is counted by the genus of the worldsheet (the num-
ber of windows plus twice the number of handles). this is the euler number
, counted by the integral of the worldsheet curvature (see exercise ixa7.3). our
worldsheet action thus consists of the three terms

s =z d2

2

g(cid:20) 1



gmn 1

2 (mx)  (nx) +  + (ln ) 1

2 r(cid:21)

a lattice version of this action is (with  given in subsection viic4)

s1 =

xhjki

1

2 (xj  xk)2 + xj

1 + (ln )xj

1 xhjki

1 +xj

1

where j are vertices of the lattice, hjki are the links, and j are the plaquets.

exercise xic2.1

put the particle on a random lattice minkowski worldline. (see exercise
vb1.2.) show the propagator for a massless particle, written in momentum
space, before taking the limit lattice spacing   0, is

 =

2

1  eip2

show this has unphysical poles at p2 = 2n/ for arbitrary integer n. how
do these results dier if the propagator is dened for wick-rotated  ?

the corresponding eld theory is easily found, according to our earlier discussions,
by (1) identifying the worldsheet lattice with a position-space feynman diagram (the

c. lattices

723

vertices of the lattice being those of the diagram, the links of the lattice being the
feynman propagators; see subsection vc8), and (2) using the 1/n expansion to
associate the faces of the worldsheet polyhedra with the u(n) indices of the scalar
eld (see subsection viic4).

we then can immediately identify the three terms in the string action with their

counterparts in the scalar eld theory:

(1) the x term gives the propagators,

(2) the area term (which counts the vertices) gives the vertex factor (coupling con-

stant), and

(3) the curvature term (which classies the topology) gives the 1/n factors of the

topological expansion.

thus, the three constants in the string action can be identied with the mass, cou-
pling, and number of colors of the scalar eld theory. explicitly, the eld theory
action is

ddx

(2)d/2 ( 1

2 e /2  g 1

nn)

s2 = n trz

where we have identied

g = e,

1

n = , m2 = 2


and we have put an overall factor of n (associated with 1/h) so that g (and m2) is
xed (rather than g times some power of n) when the 1/n expansion is performed.
(the reverse can be made true by rescaling .) the unusual kinetic operator

e /2 = 1

m2 (m2  + ...)

comes from identifying the second-quantized particle propagator as it appears in the
rst-quantized path integral for the string:

a =z yj

ddxj
(2)d/2 es1  (x, y) = e(xy)2/2

unlike the spacetime lattice, the worldsheet lattice preserves spacetime poincare
symmetry, so its not necessary to take any limits to dene a physical theory (or at
least taking limits wont improve the physical relevance of this model). this model
thus describes a sti or lumpy string. the usual continuum-worldsheet string then can
be identied with a particular limit of this more general string. explicit calculations
have demonstrated that this lattice regularization of the worldsheet reproduces the
results of the continuum approach. these results have been limited to spacetime

724

xi. strings

dimension  1 because of the inconsistencies introduced by the tachyon, which is
the ground state in higher dimensions. unfortunately, this prevents study of the

more interesting properties, such as scattering amplitudes and the precise form of
the potential (we have left n arbitrary in s2), since its superrenormalizable in d2
regardless of its form. however, these limitations probably would not appear in a

corresponding formulation of the superstring, which has no tachyons.

an interesting feature of this model is the use of gaussian propagators to get
rid of the usual perturbative divergences of momentum integration. naively, one

might suspect that such eld theories were completely nite. however, we know in

this case that the bosonic string does have divergences perturbatively in the string

coupling, and that there are further problems unless d=26. this demonstrates that
modifying a theory to x problems seen in perturbation theory does not preclude the

reappearance of such diculties nonperturbatively.

3. qcd strings

the main problem with known string theories is that they describe spacetimes
of dimension d=10. to describe physics in d=4, it is usually assumed that 6 of

the dimensions choose to compactify to submicroscopic dimensions, corresponding

to length scales well below the range of present experiments. such a solution to

the classical eld equations with minimal energy is chosen as the vacuum, about
which perturbations are performed, but nothing is known to preclude contributions to

the functional integral from other vacuua, whether 4-dimensional, 10-dimensional, or

elsewhere. although strings have been chosen to describe quantum gravity because

of their renormalizability (niteness), this advantage is lost after compactication,
since the arbitrariness in choice of compactication is tantamount to the loss of pre-

dictability in nonrenormalizable theories. however, there are some general features

of string theories, such as the appearance of a dilaton-like physical scalar, that have

suggested certain 4d models (such as no-scale supergravity, which is also suggested

by extended supergravity: see subsection xb7).

furthermore, d=10 string theories have recently been discovered to be (compacti-

cations of) d=11 membrane theories in disguise, where the eleventh dimension shows

up only nonperturbatively. not only is using a formalism where not all of the dimen-
sions are manifest a technical obstacle, but the quantum mechanics of membranes

suers from several problems, including nonrenormalizability, which is what string

theories were chosen to avoid in the rst place. this suggests that d=10 strings are

c. lattices

725

nonrenormalizable at the nonperturbative level. furthermore, even the few proper-
ties of 4d theories suggested by strings are no longer required, since compactication
from d=11 need not proceed by way of d=10.

on the other hand, renormalizabilty of theories with a nite number of elds
predicts d=4, since theories in higher dimensions are all nonrenormalizable (or have
unbounded potentials: 3 theory). furthermore, both experiments with hadrons
and theoretical arguments in qcd suggest the existence of an inherently 4d string
theory. (for example, the existence of a continuum limit for conning spacetime-
lattice theories requires asymptotic freedom.)

the reason 10d strings avoid the d=4 limit is clear from the worldsheet lattice
approach of the previous subsection: the partons that make up the string have gaus-
sian propagators, and gaussian integrals always converge. this leads to gaussian be-
havior of xed-angle scattering (subsection xia6), in conict with hadronic physics,
where power-law behavior is observed for partons with large transverse momenta, and
is a theoretical consequence of asymptotic freedom with the usual propagators. (in
fact, it is the main empirical verication of qcd.)

since nonrelativistic rst-quantization gives gaussian propagators ex2/t, it is not
surprising that the simplest strings should result in partons with gaussian propaga-
tors ex2. however, the fact that rst-quantization for particles leads instead to,
e.g., 1/x2 propagators for massless particles in 4d position space suggests that an
analogous treatment for strings should be possible. we thus attempt to follow the
derivation of the previous subsection from parton to string, but starting with realis-
tic parton propagators. the rst step is to exponentiate the propagator so that the
exponent can be identied with a rst-quantized action. the easiest way, and that
most analogous to the nonrelativistic case, is to use the schwinger parametrization
of the propagator, which follows from the appearance of the worldline metric in the
action:

as we saw in subsection vc8, a feynman diagram in a scalar eld theory with
nonderivative self-interactions is then written as

1
1
2p2

d e p2/2

=z 

0

z dxidpijdij ephiji

[ij p2

ij/2i(xixj)pij]

in the (worldsheet) continuum limit of this expression, p becomes a worldsheet vector,
so  must become a symmetric worldsheet tensor. since on a regular square lattice
(at worldsheet) there are two propagators per vertex (for the two independent
directions),  must be a traceless tensor. (this also explains why  cant be just a

726

xi. strings

scalar.) imposing this tracelessness through a lagrange multiplier , we can write
the (wicked rotated) continuum action as

s =z d2

2 {ip m  mx + 1

2mn(p m  p n + ggmn) + g[ + (ln ) 1

2 r]}

thus  acts as a kind of second worldsheet metric. however, since schwinger param-
eters are positive, mn must be positive denite, and thus a euclidean metric. this
also implies that gmn must be minkowskian, to be consistent with the tracelessness
condition. note that if we set  equal to a constant, and ignore the positivity condi-
tion on  , then eliminating  by the equation of motion from varying gmn reproduces
the usual string action, where we can identify  = /hi. this indicates a possible
approximation scheme.

the two components of  that survive this tracelessness condition correspond to
the two lightlike directions dened by gmn: if we use a zweibein, dened as usual by
+en), to atten the indices on  , then the lagrange multiplier constraint
gmn = e(m
can be solved by simply setting + = 0. the action is then

s =z d2

2

g[ip  e

mmx + 1

2p  p +  + (ln ) 1

2r]

back on the lattice, this implies that the directions chosen by the propagators (links)
on which p is dened are lightlike. thus, the matrix model dened by this theory
should have only 4-point vertices, with the four propagators coming from any vertex
forming the worldsheet lightcone at that point on the worldsheet. the eld theory
action is thus

s2 = n trz

ddx
(2)d/2 ( 1

4    g 1

44)

for d = 4, this action describes an asymptotically free theory, wrong-sign 4
theory.

unlike conventional strings, the qcd string has critical dimension d=4 for renor-
malizability. (in conventional strings all momentum integrals are gaussian and thus
converge.) another reason for d=4 is t-duality: t-duality interchanges the positions
of the vertices with the momenta of the loops. this is clear from our discussion of
the classical mechanics of feynman diagrams in subsection vc8, if we note that the
procedure we used there to translate from coordinates to loop momenta is exactly the
random lattice version of the t-duality transformation performed in subsection xib4
(with x as the loop momenta). thus, invariance of a string theory under t-duality
must include invariance of the propagators of the underlying eld theory under fourier
transformation. this is trivial for conventional strings, since the fourier transform

c. lattices

727

of a gaussian is a gaussian. however, by dimensional analysis (or explicit evalua-
tion: see exercise viib4.2), we see that the fourier transform of 1/p2 is 1/x2 only in
d=4: t-duality implies both d=4 and masslessness. furthermore, we can look at

interactions by considering the simplest case: the at worldsheet is represented by a
regular, at lattice. for 4 theory we have the usual square lattice, which is self-dual
under switching vertices with loops (t-duality). on the other hand, triangular and
hexagonal lattices, corresponding to 6 and 3 theory, are dual to each other (i.e., n
is dual to 2n/(n2), as follows from geometry). thus t-duality also implies the 4
interaction.

exercise xic3.1

lets examine t-duality for the random lattice more carefully:

a repeat the t-duality transformation of subsection xib4, but for the qcd
string (see subsection vc8), without a background (m mn = mn). show that
invariance under x m  xm requires that the matrix  also be replaced by
its inverse, with some factors of the 2d  tensor. ( also transforms; you can

avoid this complication by using the zweibein form of the action.)

b write the massless scalar propagator in momentum space of arbitrary dimen-

sion d as an exponential using a schwinger parameter  . show that after
t-duality  fourier transformation combined with   1/ (which leaves
the exponent invariant)  a  -dependent measure factor is introduced,

except for d=4.

string theories describe particles of arbitrarily large spins: so far in this text we

have concentrated on lower spins, but we can describe (at least) free gauge-invariant

actions for arbitrary spins based on quantum mechanical brst.

gauge invariance is required in eld theory to manifest lorentz invariance. the

basic problem is that a four-vector wave function cannot have the obvious minkowski

inner product, since the time component would have a minus sign in its normalization,

resulting in negative probability. in the classical action there is a gauge invariance

that allows the time component to be dropped from the action. however, such gauges

destroy manifest lorentz invariance, since a three-vector cannot represent lorentz

transformations in a local way. more useful gauges keep all components of the four-

vector, while also introducing scalar fermionic ghosts to cancel the eects of the

bad part of the four-vector. a certain symmetry between the bosonic and fermionic

unphysical degrees of freedom is needed to enforce this cancelation: it is the eld

theoretic version of the brst symmetry discussed in section via.

another complication is that gauge transformations do not allow the elimination

of traces in a simple way: although it is lorentz covariant to constrain a tensor

to vanish when a pair of its vector indices is contracted, this interferes with gauge

invariance in interacting theories, such as gravity. a related complication is massive

theories, which cant always be described simply by adding mass terms to massless

theories.

there is a simple solution to all these problems, which determines the free part

of the action for any theory. (interactions are a separate problem.) this method

automatically introduces all the correct elds, including ghosts, for any massless or

massive theory. it also gives a simple universal expression for the brst symmetry

that cancels unphysical modes, as well as providing a simple proof that these modes

disappear in the lightcone gauge. the method is based on the idea of introducing

extra fermionic dimensions to spacetime that are unphysical (unlike superspace for

supersymmetry), which cancel unphysical degrees of freedom associated with the time

dimension.

although for most purposes the only spins of fundamental particles relevant in

eld theory for are 0, 1/2, 1, 3/2 (maybe), and 2, and these few cases can be studied

separately, in this chapter well analyze all free theories because:

(1) the ultimate theory of particles may require them;

730

xii. mechanics

(2) some of the theories presently under most active investigation (such as strings

and membranes) require them;

(3) many observed, though perhaps not fundamental, particles have higher spin; and

(4) a better understanding of eld theory can be obtained by determining exactly

which properties all elds have in common as well as how they dier.

this construction involves the introduction of spacetime symmetries that are not
manifest on the physical coordinates. an important analog is the conformal group in
d dimensions, which acts nonlinearly on the usual d spacetime coordinates, but can
be represented linearly on d+2 coordinates, since the group is so(d,2). as described
in subsection ia6 for spin 0, 1 space and 1 time coordinate can be eliminated, so that
so(d,2) is still represented, but so(d1,1) is the largest orthogonal group that is
still manifest. we have also seen that in the lightcone gauge this manifest symmetry
is reduced again in the same way, leaving so(d2). in our case the relevant group is
osp(d,2|2), the natural generalization of the orthogonal group to d space, 2 time, and
2 anticommuting dimensions. this allows rotations between timelike and fermionic
directions, eventually resulting in their cancelation.

we saw in subsection iib3 how the single equation of motion sa

applied to eld strengths, universally described all spins in all dimensions, for free,
massless particles. (a possible exception is the spinless case, where we need = 0,
which is redundant otherwise. however, we can use the universal eld equation even
in that case if we use the vector eld strength formulation of spin 0.) one way we
solved this equation was to perform a unitary transformation. we can use the same
unitary transformation, plus the constraints, to simplify the lorentz generators. to
= 0, solved for , to choose
further simplify matters, we can use the constraint
the gauge x+ = 0, which is equivalent to working in the schrodinger picture (no
time dependence for operators). the procedure is thus: (1) start with the manifest
(antihermitian) representation of the lorentz generators,

(2) apply the transformation

j ab = x[ab] + sab

j  uju1,

ln u = s+i i
+

a. osp(1,1|2)

731

which eliminates the only s+i term, in j +i (while complicating ji). (3) finally, apply
the constraints, which have already been transformed by this same transformation,

= 0

( gauge x+ = 0),

sabb + wa = 0  s+  w = si = 0

our lorentz generators are then

j +i = xi+,

j + = x+ + w,

j ij = x[ij] + sij

j i = xi +

1
+ [ 1

2 xi(j)2 + sijj + wi]

these generators satisfy the pseudo(anti)hermiticity condition

j ab(+)12w = (+)12wj ab

this means that the hilbert-space metric needs a factor of (+)12w. this is related
to the fact that the w terms can be eliminated by a nonunitary transformation with
the appropriate power of +: as part of step 2, we could have applied a second
transformation

u2 = (+)s+

with the result of eliminating all s+ terms, so the redundant constraint s+ = w
would not have been needed, so w would not appear. u2 is in fact just the trans-
formation that takes the surviving independent part of the eld strength f +...+i...j to
the lightcone gauge eld ai...j, taking us from the original constrained eld strengths
to unconstrained gauge elds. in any case, we generally choose w = 0 for bosons.

we previously applied dimensional reduction to the eld equations for the eld
strengths, to obtain the equations for the massive, free theories from the massless
ones. the same methods can be applied to the lorentz (or poincare) generators.
(the lorentz generators will be used later to nd the brst operator, to obtain the
eld equations in terms of the gauge elds, and the action. for that purpose the
dimensional reduction can be performed at any stage in the derivation.) we thus nd
the general result

j ij = x[ij] + sij

1
+{ 1

j +i = xi+,
j i = xi +

j + = x+ + w,
2xi[(j)2  m2] + sijj + si1im + wi}
(the 1 is still an index, and should not be confused with an inverse.)

note that si and s+ were eliminated (after the unitary transformation) by the
constraints, and that s+i just dropped out. (in other words, s+i = 0 was the gauge

732

xii. mechanics

choice for the constraint si = 0.) this leaves only sij (and si1 in the massive case),
whose representation is that of the highest-weight part of the original eld strength.
however, we can more simply choose the representation of sij as our starting point,
since it is just the transverse part of the gauge eld; it denes the representation of the
poincare group. we therefore have an explicit construction of the generators of the
poincare group, for arbitrary representations, dened on just the physical degrees of
freedom, given directly by the little group so(d2) spin generators sij (or so(d1)
generators sij and si1 in the massive case) that identify the representation. for
example, in d=4, so(2) has just one generator, the helicity, so for any state of a
given helicity we know the action of the poincare generators.

classical free eld theory is easy to dene in the lightcone, since solving the
constraints in the lightcone formalism has picked out just the physical components,
so the only remaining constraint is the klein-gordon equation. thus, the kinetic term
for any massless bosonic eld is simply  1
2 (i)2,
and  is considered the time derivative.
(in general, the kinetic operator for a
massless boson is some second-order dierential operator, which reduces to
on the
/+, since we must then have
physical components.) for fermions we have instead
an odd number of derivatives to avoid getting a trivial result after integration by
parts. (for a boson,  = ( 1
2 2), for a fermion  = () ()2 = ()
by anticommutativity. in general, the kinetic operator for a massless fermion is some
/+ after eliminating auxiliary
rst-order dierential operator, which reduces to
elds.)

2 = + + 1

this quantum mechanical representation of the lorentz generators has a simple
translation into classical eld theory, in terms of eld theory poisson brackets. the
denition of poisson brackets in lightcone quantum eld theory follows directly from
the action: dening as usual the canonical momentum  as (minus, in our conven-
tions) the variation of the lagrangian with respect to the time derivative + (= )
of the variable , we nd the fundamental bracket for bosons

 = +  [(x, xi), (x, xi)] = i

+ (2)d/2(x  x)d2(xi  xi)

(note that the + was essential for the antisymmetry of the bracket. we can also
evaluate its inverse as an integral, so 1
2(x  x). for fermions
we have instead an anticommutator and no 1/+.) we then nd that any quantum

note that the free poincare generators are local in this form, from cancelation of
+s. in interacting theories, the generator j i, as well as the translation generator
p, which is also the hamiltonian, gets additional terms higher-order in the elds.
in this manner, relativistic quantum eld theory can be quantized in a way that
more resembles nonrelativistic eld theory than in non-lightcone methods, since
is quadratic in the usual time derivative 0. we wont consider lightcone quantum
eld theory further; however, in the following sections well use this construction to
derive free gauge theory and its covariant quantization, in a way that well generalize
straightforwardly to interactions. thus, the same construction directly gives the
formulation of free representations of the poincare group, from eld strengths to
transverse elds to covariant gauge elds.

2. algebra

from the denition of the graded determinant in terms of gaussian integrals (see
subsection iic3), we see that anticommuting coordinates act like negative dimen-
sions: for example, sdet(ki) = kab for a commuting and b anticommuting dimen-
sions. thus, if we add equal numbers of commuting and anticommuting dimensions,
they eectively cancel. here well do the same for theories with spin, which allows
the restoration of manifest lorentz covariance to lightcone theories: adding 2 com-
muting and 2 anticommuting dimensions to so(d2) gives osp(d1,1|2) (see also
subsection iic3), which has an so(d1,1) subgroup.

we have seen that quantum eld theory requires unphysical anticommuting elds
to cancel the commuting unphysical elds introduced by using gauges that do not
eliminate longitudinal polarizations. for example, the gauge eld for electromag-
netism has only d2 components in the lightcone gauge, but needs to keep all d
components to maintain manifest lorentz covariance; this requires 2 ghosts to can-
cel the 2 extra components of the gauge eld. the general result, at least for bosonic

734

xii. mechanics

gauge elds, is to produce elds that form representations of osp(d1,1|2), includ-
ing gauge elds and ghosts. furthermore, by adding 2 anticommuting dimensions the
brst transformations that relate the ghosts to the longitudinal degrees of freedom
can be introduced in a natural way, as translations in the new coordinates. the result
is that osp(d1,1|2) multiplets are automatic, and gauge xing receives a geometric
interpretation. in this section well see that an even more natural interpretation of
these brst transformations is as rotations of the anticommuting coordinates, and
that they not only make gauge xing to the simplest lorentz covariant gauge triv-
ial, but also give a simple derivation of the gauge invariant action itself. (the two
points of view are related in that translations can be considered as part of conformal
rotations, as we saw in subsection ia6.)

the basic idea is very simple: take the lightcone representation of the poincare
generators, found in the previous subsection, and extend the so(d2) indices and
representations to osp(d1,1|2) ones (including appropriate signs for the grading).
conversely, we can begin the construction with the conformal group osp(d+1,3|2),
nd the equations of motion for the poincare group osp(d,2|2), and solve them
for the lightcone group osp(d1,1|2). so we can use the same expressions for the
generators, but now the transverse osp(d1,1|2) index is

i = (a, )

where a is a d-component index of so(d1,1) and  is a 2-component index of sp(2).
the osp(d1,1|2) metric is

ij = (ab, c )

furthermore, we divide up the full osp(d,2|2) index as
a = (, )

(, i) = (a, a),

we now interpret the so(d1,1) subgroup that acts on the a index as the usual
physical one, since the generators take the usual covariant form (because all the
transverse generators are linear). the orthogonal subgroup osp(1,1|2) that acts on
the a index, and leaves the a index alone, is then interpreted as a symmetry group
of the unphysical degrees of freedom, an extension of brst. however, the generators
with  indices are nonlinear, since the  indices are no longer independent from the
rest. (the + were gauged away, the  were xed by equations of motion.) as a
result, they act on transverse indices in a nontrivial way.

since the osp(1,1|2) generators act only in the unphysical directions, all physical
states should be singlets (with respect to the cohomology) under this symmetry.
this is clear from the original construction: we started with linear generators for
osp(d,2|2) (and translations and dilatations for (d,2|2) dimensions), applied the
equations of motion in terms of them, and now we apply the osp(1,1|2) singlet
condition last. if we had instead applied the osp(1,1|2) singlet condition rst to the
(d,2|2) dimensional space, we would have gotten the usual (d1,1|0) dimensional
space, and nally applying the equations of motion would have given us the lightcone
results of subsection iib3.

write the general commutation relations of osp(d1,1|2). specialize to the
case osp(1,1|2), in lightcone notation. show that this representation satises
them, paying special attention to signs. (use the osp(d1,1|2) commutators
for the ss.)

we can also add a nonminimal part to the general minimal part of the
osp(1,1|2) algebra we have already derived, in the sense that the two parts com-
mute and separately satisfy the commutation relations:

j ab  j ab + sab

(this is similar to adding spin pieces to orbital in the absence of constraints relating

nonminimal coordinates and momenta. it will prove convenient to perform some
transformations j  uju1 that make the osp(1,1|2) generators more similar to
what they were before adding the spin parts. we therefore make two consecutive
transformations:

j  u2u1ju1

1 u1

:

u1 = e s+/+

,

u2 = (+) s+

to return j+ and j + to their previous forms. in fact, these are just the osp(1,1|2)
version of the same transformations we used in the previous subsection to remove s+i
and s+. the result is

j + = x+,
j  = x +

here we have

k =  1

2(  m2),

s = s + s, q = s + sbb + s1im  s+k

but more generally we can satisfy the commutation relations by requiring only that
k, q, and s are independent of the unphysical coordinates x and x and their
momenta, and satisfy that their only nontrivial commutators are

{q,q} = 2k s,

[ s,q] = q(c ),

[ s, s] = (
(

s)

)

u2 is nonunitary, which makes s hermitian (rather than antihermitian) after
the transformation, requiring a modication of the usual representation for s. the
usual representation can also be used by introducing an i into the transformation,
which gives s a factor of i in q. however, this i can be removed by the same
method used in subsection iib4 to remove is associated with the index 1, only now
it is applied to both the + and  indices.

3. action

we saw in the previous subsection that physical states are singlets under the
osp(1,1|2) brst symmetry. it was introduced in a trivial way, but became nontrivial
after solving the equations of motion; on the other hand, applying the singlet condition
rst reproduced the usual lightcone analysis. reversing the order of applying the two
conditions has the advantage of allowing the physical state condition to be expressed
as a single equation, which can be derived from an action.

a. osp(1,1|2)

737

there are two ways of doing this: one is to use this algebra to generalize to gauge
elds the rst-quantized brst as applied to eld theory in subsection via3. because
of their quantum mechanical origin, the gauge-invariant q actions directly give a
form suitable for choosing the fermi-feynman gauge, where the kinetic operator is
simply  m2. however, this is somewhat unusual for fermions, whose simplest eld
equation is rst-order. (but it is useful for supersymmetry, where bosons and fermions
are treated symmetrically.) as a result, this approach gives actions for fermions with
an innite number of auxiliary and ghost elds. the most convenient way to discover
the usual nite-component gauge-invariant rst-order actions hidden there is by per-
forming an appropriate unitary transformation, after which this action (for bosons or
fermions) appears as the sum of three terms: the usual gauge-invariant action, a term
giving the usual second-quantized brst transformations, and a nonderivative term
that would be considered nonminimal under second-quantized brst. this approach
will be described in detail in the following sections.

the other way is to dene a  function in the generators of the group osp(1,1|2),

and use it as the kinetic operator for the action:

s = z dx dxd2x 1

4+(jab)

where the integration is over all the coordinates appearing in the osp(1,1|2) gener-
ators. (the dx part is the usual ddx/(2)d/2.) + comes from the usual relativistic
inner product; it is also a measure factor, which is a consequence of our using
generators satisfying the pseudohermiticity condition

jab+ = +jab

equivalently, we could redene   (+)1/2, j  (+)1/2j(+)1/2 (assuming
+ 6= 0, as usual in lightcone formalisms) to eliminate it and restore hermiticity.
(this would only aect j+  j+  1
2 , j   j  + /2+, making hermitian
the terms 1
4{x, }/+.) because of the  function, this action has
the gauge invariance

2{x, +} and 1

 = 1

2j baab

thus, the eld equations and gauge invariance reduce  to states in the osp(1,1|2)
cohomology.

more explicitly, the  function can be written as

+(jab) = +(j

2)(j+)2(j +)2(j )

= (x)2(x)( s

2)+2j2

738

xii. mechanics

where we have used

j+(j+) = (j+)j+ = 0  (j+) =

1
+ (x)

(there is freedom in ordering of the original  functions: reordering of any two s
produces terms that are killed by the other s.) the ( s
2) can be interpreted as a
kronecker s0 in the sp(2) spin s:

s s = 4s(s + 1)

 1

2

(remember s is antihermitian, and i s is always integer while s can be half-
integer). the rest of the explicit s are dirac s in the unphysical coordinates,
which can therefore be trivially integrated out, leaving:

s =z dx lgi,

lgi = 1

2 kgi,

kgi = 1

2 ( + m2 + 1

2qq)

where  is  evaluated at x = x = s = 0. furthermore, the remaining gauge
invariance is

 = s0

1

2q

from j , since j , j +, and j+ have been used to gauge to s = x = x = 0,
respectively.

exercise xiia3.1

show explicitly that this action is invariant under the osp(1,1|2) gauge trans-
formations. (hint: use the same method as exercise xa2.1.)

4. spinors

as we saw in subsection via3, the brst algebra for the (dirac) spinor requires
nonminimal terms. for the general case of fermions we add these terms in the general
way described in subsection xiia2, choosing them in terms of a (second) set of
osp(1,1|2)  matrices:

sab =  1

2 [a, b},

{a, b] = ab

where a = (,; , i) in the notation of subsection via3. in particular, we nd

s = s  1

2 ()

q = sbb + s1im + [ + + 1

2(  m2)]

a. osp(1,1|2)

739

the next step for general massless fermions (and similarly for the massive case)

is to apply

q2 = 1

2 sas

bab  (  +k)s

aa  1
2k

where we have used

 = c  1

2[, ] = 1

at this point we note that the gauge invariance generated by q, for gauge parameter
 = , includes a term  that allows us to choose the gauge

+ = 0

one way to think of this is to treat + as an anticommuting coordinate and  as
its derivative; another way is to treat them as 22 matrices. alternatively, we can
unitarily transform the action to contain just the  term of the operator: from the
discussion of 2d  matrices of subsection viiia7 we nd, including that part of the
spinor metric,

  = (cid:0) 1

0

0

0(cid:1)

then acts as a projection operator. either way, the net result is to reduce the action
to, now restoring the mass,

sf =z dx lgi,f ,

lgi,f = 1
2

kgi,f ,

kgi,f = 1

2 (s

aa + s1im)

where  is  with the -dependence eliminated (the top component in the above
matrix representation). thus,  diers from the bosonic case in that it not only
depends on xa and is a representation of sij, but is also a representation of , which
appears in s to dene s = 0.

the only type of representation we have missed in this analysis is self-dual anti-

symmetric tensors. in terms of eld strengths, these satisfy

fa1...ad/2 =  1

(d/2)! a1...ad/2b1...bd/2f b1...bd/2

which is consistent, with lorentz metric, if d/2 is odd (as seen from applying the
 tensor twice). a similar condition holds for the gauge eld in the lightcone gauge
(with a (d2)-dimensional  tensor). because of the  tensor, this condition cant be
described by adding extra dimensions to the lightcone. however, the direct product of
two spinors contains all antisymmetric tensors, and the rank d/2 one can be picked
out by an appropriate osp invariant constraint. the self-dual part of this tensor
comes from the direct product of chiral spinors.

740

xii. mechanics

exercise xiia4.1

we now consider this construction in more detail:

a derive the generalization of 1 to osp  matrices, anticommuting with both
the fermionic and bosonic s, {1, a} = 0. we can use the usual product
for the fermionic s, but obviously the bosonic ones will need something
dierent. (hint: for each pair of fermionic or bosonic s there is a klein
factor, as in exercise ia2.3e; for the fermionic s the exponential is equal to
the usual product.)

b in twice-odd dimensions, consider the direct product of two spinors by rep-
resenting the osp spin operators as a sum in terms of the two dierent sets
of osp  matrices acting on the two dierent spinor indices. dene the u(1)
(o(2)) symmetry that mixes the two  matrices by taking linear complex
combinations of the  matrices to form fermionic creation and annihilation
operators, so the osp-invariant u(1) generator is aaaa. show that the eigen-
values of this generator pick out the dierent lorentz representations. these
can be made irreducible by including 1 projections. using explicit u(1)
and (both) 1 projectors in the action, show that self-dual tensors can be
described. (note: this description contains an innite number of auxiliary
elds.)

5. examples

the osp(1,1|2) method is thus an ecient method for nding gauge-invariant
actions (though not so useful for gauge xing). we begin with examples of massless
bosons, for which the gauge-invariant kinetic operator is

kgi = 1

2 ( + 1

2qq),

q = saa

the scalar is a trivial example; the simplest nontrivial example is the massless vec-
tor: in terms of the basis |ii for an osp(d1,1|2) vector (d-vector plus 2 ghosts),
normalized to

hi|ji = ij  ha|bi = ab,

h|i = c 

we can write the osp(d1,1|2) generators as

sij
(1) = |[iihj)|

the sp(2)-singlet eld is then (dropping the |i term)

 = |aiaa(x)

a. osp(1,1|2)

741

we then have

q = (|iha|  |aih|)a  q2  1
 lgi(1) = 1

2qq = |aihb|ab  1
8(fab)2

2|ih|

and for the gauge invariance

 = s0

1

2q   = |i(x)  aa = a

a more complicated example is the graviton (massless spin 2): we write the eld,
a graded symmetric, traceless osp(d1,1|2) tensor, in terms of the direct product
of two vectors, with basis |ii|ji. the spin operators are thus

sij = sij

(1)  i(1) + i(1)  sij

(1)

where the rst factor in each term acts on the rst factor in |ii|ji, etc.; i(1) is the
spin-1 identity. the s = 0 part of the eld is then

 = |ii|jihji,

hi

i = ha

a + h

 = 0   = (|ai|bi + 1

2|i|iab)hab

where hab includes its trace. the rest is straightforward algebra; we use identities
such as:

(1)  i(1) + i(1)  q2

q2 = q2
(1)  q(1)
q
(1)  q(1) = (|i|iha|hb| + |ai|bih|h|)ab

(1) + q

(h|h|)(|i|i) = h|ih|i = 2

where q2
anticommuting. the nal result is then

(1) was evaluated above, and in the last identity we used the fact that |i is

lgi(2) =  1

4 [hab hab + 2(bhab)2  ha

a hb

b + 2ha

abchbc]

in agreement with subsection ixb1. the original osp(1,1|2) gauge invariance reduces
to

 = (|i|ai + |ai|i)a  hab = (ab)

exercise xiia5.1

consider a (d2)-rank antisymmetric tensor (i.e., totally antisymmetric in
d2 indices in d dimensions; see exercises iib2.1 and viiia8.2, and subsec-
tion xa3).

742

xii. mechanics

a show from a lightcone analysis that it is equivalent to a scalar. derive the
gauge-invariant action using osp methods. find the gauge transformations
and eld strength.

b find a rst-order form for the action, (auxiliary eld)2 + (auxiliary eld) 
(eld strength). show that eliminating the gauge eld as a lagrange multipler
results in the action for a scalar. show that switching between scalar and
antisymmetric tensor is equivalent to switching eld equation and constraint
for the eld strength.

c find the description for the massive case by dimensional reduction.

exercise xiia5.2

consider a tensor totally symmetric in its vector indices.
in the lightcone
gauge, the irreducible tensor is traceless. show that, upon covariantiza-
tion, the eld appearing in the gauge-invariant action satises a double-
tracelessness condition (or equivalently the elds appearing there are the
totally traceless tensor and another totally tracelsss tensor with two less in-
dices).

for massless fermions we saw

kgi,f = 1

2 s

aa

the next step is to use the fact that arbitrary fermionic representations are con-
structed by taking the -traceless piece of the direct product of a (dirac) spinor with
an irreducible bosonic representation. (just as an irreducible bosonic representation
of an orthogonal group is found by taking the direct product of vectors, choosing an
appropriate symmetry, as described by the young tableau, and requiring the trace
in any two vector indices to vanish; here we also require that using a  matrix to
contract the spinor index with any vector index also vanishes. of course, simpler
methods can be used for so(3,1), but we need methods that apply to all dimensions,
so they can be applied to orthosymplectic groups.) we then can write

sij = sij  1

2[i, j}  s = s  a(a)

where sij is the part of the spin acting on just the vector indices, and we have
combined  and  into creation and annihilation operators, as in subsection via3:

a = 12

( + i),

a = 12

(  i);

[a, a] = 



for spin 1/2 s = 0, s0 projects to the ground-state of the oscillators, and we

immediately nd

s

a = a  lgi(1/2) = 1

4

aia 

a. osp(1,1|2)

743

where we have used

 = i 1

2(aa  aa) = i(aa  1) = i(n + 1)

and this n counts the a excitation level.
(note that the hilbert-space inner
product between the spinors includes the usual factor of 0.) a less trivial case is
spin 3/2: now

 = |iii,

sa = a + |[iha]|

where i has an explicit vector index, and an implicit spinor index. then from -
tracelessness (for irreducibility) we have for the sp(2) singlets

ii = 0   = aa  aa = 0,  =  12

aaa

after a little algebra, using identities such as

1

6[abc] = abc + 1

2 (b(ac)  acb)

we nd

lgi(3/2) =  1

12

a[abc]ib c

from inspection, or from  = s0

1

2q, we nd the gauge invariance

 a = a

exercise xiia5.3

lets now examine some massive examples:

a find the gauge-invariant actions for massive spin 2 and spin 3/2 by dimen-

sional reduction of the massless cases.

ahb]

b note that for the spin-2 case the part of the mass term quadratic in h is
b. more generally, we might have expected (hab)2 +
proportional to h[a
a)2 for arbitrary constant k, since the rst part gives mass to the physical
k(ha
(transverse, traceless) part of h, while the second term aects only the unphys-
ical pieces. find the stuckelberg terms generated from this generalized mass
term by the linearized gauge invariance. looking at just the terms quadratic
in the stuckelberg vector, what is special about k = 1, and why do other
values of k give ghosts? (hint: compare gauge-xed electromagnetism.)

although the osp(1,1|2) method is the simplest way to derive general free gauge-
invariant actions, it does not yield a simple method for gauge xing, even though
the hilbert space contains exactly the right set of ghosts. we now describe a related
method that is slightly less useful for nding gauge-invariant actions (it includes
redundant auxiliary elds), but allows gauges to be xed easily.

1. algebra

for this method we use a subset of the osp(1,1|2) constraints, and show they are
sucient. a simple analog is su(2): to nd su(2) singlets, its sucient to look for
states that are killed by both t3 and the raising operator t1 + it2. this approach
gives a formalism that turns out to be easier to generalize to interacting theories, as
well as allowing a simple gauge-xing procedure. we rst divide up the sp(2) indices
as  = (,) (not to be confused with ). we then make a similarity transformation
that simplies some of the generators (while making others more complicated):

j  uju1 :

u = (+)ij 

which changes the hilbert-space metric (and corresponding hermiticity conditions) to

 = uu = (1)ij 

,

h|i =z   

this simplies (looking at the massless case without sab for simplicity)

j + 

1
+ j + = x

j+  j+  ij,

j  j

j  j+ + ij = (x+) + 1

2x + saa + s

(we use the same conventions for raising and lowering sp(2) indices as for su(2) in
subsection iia4 and sl(2,c) in subsection iia5.) these four generators form the
j ,
subgroup gl(1|1) of osp(1,1|2) (=sl(1|2)): we can write the generators as ji
where i = (+,). in subsection xiib4 well see that the singlets of this gl(1|1) are
the same as those of osp(1,1|2).

on the other hand, because of the simplied form of these generators, its easy to
see how to reduce the group even further: applying some of the constraints on wave
functions/elds to the right,

j + = x = 0,

j+ + ij = x+ = 0

746

xii. mechanics

 j = ix + i + s,

j = 1

2x + saa + s

(of course, this further reduction could have been performed even without the trans-
formation.) we are now left with the group igl(1), with just j and j as gener-
ators. (j acts as translations for the gl(1) generator j.) also, we have reduced
the unphysical coordinates to just x. we now simplify notation by relabeling

c = x,

b = ,

s3 = is,

j = ij + 1,

q = j

 j = cb + s3,

q = 1

2 c + saa + sb

j and q are versions of the ghost-number and brst operators introduced in sub-
section via1. the net result for obtaining these igl(1) generators from the original
osp(1,1|2) generators can also be stated as

j = ij|=0,+=1,

q = j|=0,+=1

where  = 0 can be regarded as a gauge condition for the constraint x = 0, and
+ = 1 for x+ ( /(ln +)) = 0. the igl(1) algebra is
2{q, q} = 0

[j, q] = q,

q2 = 1

exercise xiib1.1

show that any igl(1) subgroup of osp(1,1|2) (j = ij, q = j) satis-
es these commutation relations. check that this nal representation of the
igl(1) algebra satises them.

exercise xiib1.2

using the results of subsection xiia2,

a give expressions for q and j in terms of (c, b,) k, q, and s.
b derive {q,q}, assuming only q2 = 0 and the previous results for [ s, s]

and [ s,q].

2. inner product

the new inner product can be derived by the same steps: starting with the
lightcone inner product of subsection xiia1, we add extra dimensions to get the
osp(d,2|2) inner product. we next drop dependence on x, which will be eliminated
in the igl(1) formalism. then we perform the transformation with (+)ij  =
(+)j1 used to simplify the brst operator. this acts on both elds in the inner
product; applying integration by parts turns one such factor into (+)j . the net

b. igl(1)

747

eect is that it cancels the + in the hilbert-space metric, which allows us to drop
the x integration, and it introduces a factor of (1)j .

rather than dening a hilbert-space inner product, which is sesquilinear, it is
slightly more convenient to dene a symplectic inner product, replacing the hermitian
conjugate of the wave function/state on the left with the transpose, in analogy to an
ordinary vector inner product. the inner product is then

h|i = i(1)z dx dc  t (x, c)(1)j (x, c)

a hilbert-space inner product can then be dened simply as h *|i (where ( *)t =
 ). we have included a sign factor corresponding to what would be obtained if the
dc integration were moved to the symmetric position between the two wave functions:
by (1) we mean take  = 0 in the exponent if  is bosonic and 1 if  is fermionic.
we can make this manifest by dening

 (x, c) = hx, c|i  i = iz dx dc |x, ci(1)jhx, c|

which allows the inner product to be evaluated between h| and |i by inserting this
form for the identity i.

exercise xiib2.1

work out the inner product for the vector eld in terms of all of the compo-
nents (both expanding over c and separating physical and ghost parts of the
osp(d1,1|2) vector).

as a result, any commuting or anticommuting constant factor a can be moved

out of the inner product from the left or right in the usual way:

h|ai = h|ia,

ha|i = ah|i

as a consequence of the anticommutativity of the integration measure, we have

(1)h|i = (1)++1

meaning that the statistics of the inner product is the opposite of an ordinary product;
we can think of |  as a fermion.

because of the change in metric from the lightcone, the igl(1) generators now

satisfy

j t = 1  j,

qt = q

748

xii. mechanics

where the constant comes from dropping the extra coordinates, and the transpose
 t  indicates integration by parts (the usual transpose in the innite-matrix repre-
sentation of operators):

z o =z (1)o(ot  )

before our transformations the generators all satised gt = g; now they are pseu-
doantisymmetric with respect to the metric (1)j , up to the constant:

h|oi = h o|i  o = (1)jot (1)j

j = 1  j,

q = q

from j t = 1  j also follows the symmetry property of the inner product:

h|i = (1)(+1)(+1)h|i

this can be interpreted as antisymmetry once the anticommutativity of the | 
(metric) is taken into account.

the hermiticity conditions that follow from the change from the lightcone are

j = 1  j,

q = q

before all generators were antihermitian; now they are pseudoantihermitian, up to a
constant:

o = (1)jo(1)j

 j = 1  j,

q = q

the factor of i in the inner product compensates for the funny hermiticity of (1)j .
we then nd the usual hermiticity condition for a vector inner product,

h|i* = h| i

3. action

as explained in subsection via1, we are interested in states in the cohomology

of the brst operator q, which means states satisfying

q = 0,

 = iq

in particular, the physical states are states in the cohomology of q at ghost number
j = 0. however, now q = 0 is the wave equation (as in subsection via3), and q

b. igl(1)

749

contains the usual gauge transformations (as in the osp(1,1|2) action of the previous
section).

the free gauge-invariant action for an arbitrary eld theory is then

s0 = (1)z dx dc 1

2t j1q = (1)z dx dc 1

2 t qj0

for a real column-vector eld . (complex elds can be decomposed into their real
and imaginary parts. for relating to quantum mechanics, we will usually consider
the column-vector in our osp hilbert-space notation.) this action gives q = 0 as
the equations of motion, and has  = q as a gauge invariance, so the solutions are
the cohomology of q. the projector j0 is a kronecker  restricting  to vanishing
ghost-number (and thus q to ghost number 1, since [j, q] = q). as well see in
the next section, this projector is redundant: the states in the cohomology with
nonvanishing momentum automatically have vanishing ghost-number, and the states
with nonvanishing ghost-number are needed for gauge xing. the projection is useful
only for eliminating states that are redundant for discussing gauge invariance; well
drop it for the remainder of this section. the complete free action is then

s0 = (1)z dx dc 1

2 t (1)j1q = 1

2h|iqi = s0

where we have included the inner-product metric. this is just the translation of
the free brst operator from rst- to second-quantized form, as for the lightcone in
subsection xiia1.

we now consider some simple examples, to see how this method reproduces the

usual results. the simplest example is the scalar: as shown in subsection via3,

q = c 1

2(  m2)  z dc 1

2 (1)j1q =  1

2  1

2(  m2)

without restrictions to vanishing ghost number, unitary transformations, gauge xing,
etc. thus the scalar is in no way a gauge eld: the kinetic operator follows from
simple kinematic considerations.

the fundamental example of a gauge theory is a vector: it is the dening repre-
sentation of the lorentz group, and of the extended lorentz group we used to dene
the brst operator. in the rest of this chapter we will see from its action most of the
general properties of gauge theories: ghosts, gauge invariance, brst transformations
of the elds, the gauge-invariant action, gauge xing, backgrounds, mass, etc.
in
addition to the equations given for this case in subsection xiia5, we will use

h|i = h|i = i

750

xii. mechanics

the brst and ghost-number operators are

q = 1

2 c + (|iha|  |aih|)a + 2|ih|b,

j = cb + i(|ih| + |ih|)

the eld is real; it cant be called hermitian, since it is a column vector, but each
component of that vector is hermitian. (this is the same as reality, but for anti-
commuting objects reality includes extra signs that are dened to be exactly those
coming from hermitian conjugation.) thus,

 = * = (|aiaa  i|ic + i|i c)  ic(|ai aa  |i c  |i c)
t =  = (aaha| + ich|  i ch|) + ( aaha|  ch|  ch|)ic

where we denote the antields (those at order c) by a   .

the brst transformations of the elds can be found by comparing terms in 
and q: if we dene a second-quantized brst operator q such that q = q, but
q acts only on the elds while q (as usual) acts on |ii and the coordinates (x and c),
then

 = |ii(i  ici)  q = q = |ii[(1)i qi  ic(1)i+1 qi]

in other words, we compare terms in  and q, and throw in a minus sign for
transformations of fermions. (so, e.g.,  qaa is the coecient of |ai in q.) dropping
the    on q, the result is

qaa = ac, qc = 0, q c = 2i( c  1

2  a)

q aa = i( 1

2 aa  a

c), q c = 1

2

c +   a, q c =  1

2 c

note that although q is hermitian, it is antihermitian with respect to the inner-
product metric (1)j , as expected from our convention of using antihermitian gener-
ators for spacetime symmetries. (the same extra sign for hermiticity vs. pseudoher-
miticity, also because of ghosts introduced by relativistic quantum mechanics, occurs
for the spatial dirac matrices i: see subsection xc2.) as a result, our transforma-
tions agree with those of subsection via4. however, while the rst-quantized abelian
transformations also agree with those of subsections via1-3, the second-quantized
nonabelian transformations will have the extra i demonstrated in subsection via4,
following from the i introduced in the inner-product metric in the previous subsec-
tion. (this minor yet annoying factor will be further discussed in section xiic when
we relate rst- and second-quantized brst.)

the lagrangian then can be expanded as (after some integration by parts)

where we have used the transpose of the eld on the left of q. to nd the gauge-
invariant action, we can evaluate it by keeping just the (anti)elds with vanishing
ghost number (aa and c), and then eliminate the remaining antields by their equa-
tions of motion:

exercise xiib3.1

consider the example of the second-rank antisymmetric tensor (see exercises
iib2.1, viiia8.2, and xiia5.1, and subsection xa3):

a construct the states by direct product of two vectors. decompose into elds
plus antields, physical plus ghost: in particular, note the sp(2) representa-
tion of each so(d1,1) representation.

b find the brst transformations for all the (anti)elds. in particular, note
that the tensor transforms into vector ghosts (as expected from the gauge in-
variance), which themselves transform into scalar ghosts (ghosts for ghosts).

c graph all the states for s (of the sp(2) s) vs. j, and indicate there how

brst relates them.

d find the gauge-invariant action from q.

e generalize to arbitrary-rank antisymmetric tensors. compare the results of

exercise xiia5.1a.

4. solution

the identity of the cohomology and the physical states can be proven most easily

by making a unitary (gauge) transformation to the lightcone gauge:

(q, j)  u(q, j)u1 :

u = e(s+ii+s+b)/+

which simplies q while leaving j unchanged:

q  1

2c  s+,

j  cb + s3

752

xii. mechanics

these are the usual lightcone indices  of any d-vector, not to be confused with the
 used earlier when reducing from d+2 bosonic dimensions. except for the extension
to include the  index, this is the same transformation used in subsection iib3 (and
xiia1).

this makes the generators separable, allowing us to treat the two terms in q and

j independently. specically, if we integrate the action over c,

 = ic  z dc 1

2t (1)j1q =  1

it (1)s31s+
then  is just a lagrange multiplier enforcing the algebraic constraint s = 0
(ignoring +, which we always assume is invertible in the lightcone approach), leaving
just the klein-gordon term for the part of  that satises the constraint. we also
have the gauge invariance

4t (1)s3

 =  + c,

 = iq   = is+,

 = s+  1

2 

so we can shoose the gauge where  is restricted (algebraically) to be in the cohomol-
ogy of s.

to solve for the cohomology of s it is sucient to consider the reducible repre-
sentations formed by direct products of vectors (for bosons), or the direct products of
these with a single dirac spinor (for fermions), since by denition the osp(d1,1|2)
generators sij dont mix dierent irreducible osp(d1,1|2) representations. well
show that this cohomology restricts any reducible osp(d1,1|2) representation to
the corresponding reducible so(d2) lightcone representation, and therefore restricts
any irreducible osp(d1,1|2) representation to the irreducible so(d2) represen-
tation from which it was derived. (also, the irreducible representations in arbitrary
dimensions are most conveniently found by such a construction, where reduction is
performed by symmetrization and antisymmetrization and subtracting traces of vec-
tor indices, and in the fermionic case also subtracting gamma-matrix traces and using
majorana/weyl projection.)

for bosons, we rst consider the representation from which all the rest are con-
structed, the vector. writing the basis for the vector states as |ii, where sij|ki =
|[iij)k, we nd

s = 0  not |+i,|i
 = s  not |i,|i

this leaves only the transverse lightcone states, as advertised. for the direct product
of an arbitrary number of vectors, we nd the same result: the unphysical directions
are eliminated from each vector in the product.

b. igl(1)

753

we might worry that extra states in the cohomology would arise from a can-
celation of two terms, resulting from the action of the  and  parts of s.
specically, this could happen if we could separate out the supertraceless part of
(the graded symmetric part of) the product of two osp(1,1|2) vectors. (for exam-
ple, for an so(n) vector we can separate the traceless part of a symmetric tensor as
tij  1

n ijtkk.) however, this is not possible, since for osp(1,1|2)

str(b

a ) = 2  2 = 0

explicitly, we can look at the two likely candidates for extra states in the cohomology,

(and their transposes). but using

|+i|i  i|i|i

for these states we nd

s|+i = |i,

s|i = i|i

s(|+i|i + i|i|i) = 2|i|i
si|+i|i = |+i|i  i|i|i

so neither state is in the cohomology. note that we take s to anticommute with
|i; the states in the hilbert space are assigned statistics. (this is the simplest way
to allow a direct relation between wave functions and elds.)

exercise xiib4.1

check this analysis for spin 3.
note that in the lagrangian  1

4 t   it s+ the elds in  that are
nonzero when acted upon by s are auxiliary, killed by the lagrange multiplier .
on the other hand, the elds that are s on something are pure gauge, and do not
appear in the s term because s is nilpotent, while they drop out of the  
term because the elds multiplying them there are exactly the auxiliary ones that
were killed by varying . this follows from the fact that a eld that is pure gauge
with respect to s has a nonvanishing inner product only with an auxiliary eld,
since 1 = s  21 = 2s. equivalently, a eld redenition    + a 
can cancel any terms in   where one  is s on something.

for the example of the vector, we have explicitly for the transformation to the

lightcone

ln u =

+(cid:2)(|+ihi|  |iih+|)i + (|+ih|  |ih+|)b(cid:3)

5. spinors

in general we can add nonminimal terms sab of subsection xiia2: the easiest
way is to add them as the last step, remembering that q comes from j and j from
j 3; this yields

q  1

2c + saa + sb + s,

j  cb + s3 + s3

this result can also be seen from rst-quantization of spin 1/2 (subsection via3).
alternatively, if we add s at the beginning as in subsection xiia2, performing the
transformations given there, followed by the transformation

u = (+)ij 

of subsection xiib1, where j itself now contains s terms, we again nd

j + 

1
+ j + = x,

j+  j+  ij

j  j,

j  j+ + ij

adding a nal transformation

u = e s+b

(which actually undoes part of an earlier one), we again obtain the above result.

as in the previous subsection, we can also transform to the lightcone gauge, to

nd

q  1

2c  s+ + s

when analyzing the brst cohomology in the lightcone gauge, the eect of this
nonminimal term is to replace (again ignoring the factor of +)

sab  sab = sab + sab

b. igl(1)

755

(although actually only the s and s3 parts are used here).

as in subsection xiia4, when treating fermions we choose the dirac spinor rep-
resentation of osp(1,1|2) for sab. thus, for the case of spin 1/2, where sab also
is a dirac spinor representation, sab is represented by the direct product of two
osp(1,1|2) spinors. we now use the harmonic oscillator interpretation of the ghost
coordinates used in subsection xiia5 (extending it trivially to the fermionic ones),
which can be applied to arbitrary osp groups:

2[a, b},
(a + ia),

sab =  1
aa = 12
 {aa, ab] = ab,

sab =  1
aa = 12

2 [a, b}
(a  ia)
sab = a[aab)

by expanding about the oscillator vacuum, we nd this representation of osp(1,1|2)
|0i,|ai =
consists of the direct sum of totally (graded) antisymmetrized tensors:
aa|0i,|[ab)i = aaab|0i,... . but we have already treated this case for the bosons,
the result being that only the singlet (vacuum) survives. of course, the complete spin
representation is given by the direct product of the representation of the unphysical
variables (a, a) and the physical ones, namely the transverse lightcone gamma
matrices. thus, the states in the cohomology are given by the direct product of all
the lightcone states with the vacuum of the unphysical variables. to treat arbitrary
fermions, generalization to direct products of the dirac spinor with arbitrary numbers
of vectors works the same way, since the spinor looks like the direct sum of parts of
direct products of vectors as far as sab is concerned.

exercise xiib5.1

work out the explicit q and hilbert space for spin 3/2.

6. masses

as usual masses can be added by dimensional reduction: our complete result for

application to massless and massive, bosons and fermions is then

q = 1

2c(  m2) + saa + s1im + sb

(+ s),

j = cb + s3

(+ s3)

with extra is introduced implicitly by the procedure given in subsection iib4.

for example, for the vector we have (the stuckelberg formalism)

q = 1

2c(  m2) + (|iha|  |aih|)a + (|ih1| + |1ih|)m + 2|ih|b

j = cb + i(|ih| + |ih|)

756

compared to the massless case treated in subsections xiib3-4, the corresponding
eld now has the extra terms

exercise xiib6.1

use this method to work out the action and gauge transformations for massive
spin 2.

7. background elds

the coupling of external elds can be treated by suitable modication of the
brst operator. in terms of self-interacting eld theories, this corresponds to writing
the eld as the sum of quantum and background elds, and keeping in the action only
the terms quadratic in the quantum elds, as discussed for semiclassical expansions
in subsection va2 and for the background eld method in subsection vib8.

one interesting case is the coupling of an external vector gauge eld. clearly the
spacetime derivatives in q must be modied by the minimal coupling prescription
   =  + ia, but dimensional analysis and lorentz covariance also allow the
addition of a nonminimal term proportional to f absab to
. with the appropriate
coecient, the general result is (see subsection viiia3)

qi = 1

2c(  if absba) + saa + sb

where

is now the covariant 2. (j is unchanged.)

b. igl(1)

757

in the case of spin 0, this modication is trivial. for spin 1/2, we substitute
the graded generalization of the dirac matrices, sij =  1
2[i, j}, as discussed in
subsection xiia5. we then nd q2
i = 0 xes the above coecient of the nonminimal
term, the same as from squaring aa. this follows from the simple factorization of
sij in qi:

qi = c(aa)2  (aa)  ()2b = (aa + b)c(bb + b)

where we have neglected the s term of subsection xiib5, and used

[a, c] = {, c} = 0

in the spin-1 case, we nd the interesting result that q2

i = 0 requires not only the
above coecient for the nonminimal term (as expected from supersymmetry), but
also that the background terms satisfy the eld equation bf ab = 0. on the other
hand, for spins >1, q2
i = 0 implies fab = 0, so these spins cant couple minimally (at
least in at spaces). similar remarks apply to coupling gravity (spin 2) to spins >2.

exercise xiib7.1

check these statements for spin 1. compare the analogous result for back-
ground elds in the eld theoretic approach from exercise vib8.2 for yang-
mills for both the gauge transformations of the gauge-invariant action and
the eld-theoretic brst transformations of the gauge-xed action.

exercise xiib7.2

show that electromagnetism cant couple minimally to (massless) higher spins
(i.e., they cant have charge):

a show this for the graviton by considering q2
traceless osp tensor) in an external vector eld.

i = 0 for spin 2 (symmetric

b do the same for spin 3/2.

another interesting feature of the spin-1 case is that we can dene a vacuum

state

|0i = |i

which is in the free brst cohomology of q only at zero momentum (constant eld),
where q simplies to sb without background. however, this state has ghost num-
ber j = 1.
in fact, it corresponds to the global part of the gauge invariance of
the theory: gauge parameters satisfying q = 0 have no eect in the free theory
(where  = iq), but can act in the interacting theory: they do not contribute
an inhomogeneous term to gauge transformations. however, gauge parameters of the

758

xii. mechanics

form  + q have the same eect as , up to trivial transformations proportional to
the eld equations. thus, while the brst cohomology at j = 0 gives the physical
states, that at j = 1 gives the global invariances associated with the gauge eld.
now the physical states can be derived by operating on the vacuum with appro-

priate vertex operators: if we expand qi about the free brst operator q,

qi = q + v

q2

i = 0



{q, v } + v 2 = 0

qi = i[qi , ]



v = i[q + v, ]

where  is the gauge parameter for the background eld. the usual operator coho-
mology, relevant for asymptotic states, follows from linearization:

v  v0  {q, v0} = 0,

v0 = i[q, ]

in the weak-coupling limit, where v0 is the part of v linear in the background elds.
the asymptotic states in the cohomology of q are then given by

 = v0|0i,  = |0i



q = 0,

 = iq

we can check this explicitly, as

v = i 1

2c({aa, a} + ia2  f absba) + iaasa  v0|0i = aa|ai + ic 1

2 (aaa)|0i

the second term gives c = 1

2  a, in agreement with the free eld equations.

8. strings

another interesting example is strings. since rst-quantization is essential in
string s-matrix calculations, its natural to associate string eld theory with quantum
mechanical brst. as usual, for massive elds this formalism automatically includes
the stuckelberg elds that would have been found by dimensional reduction, as well
as all the ghosts. however, the explicit expression for the brst operator does not
explicitly correspond to that obtained by dimensional reduction: although the spin
operators sa, s, and s3 are quadratic in oscillators, s1 is cubic (because p ,
and thus x, is quadratic in the lightcone gauge). nevertheless, the representation
on any particular irreducible poincare representation contained among all the string
states is the same as obtained by dimensional reduction, as follows from the generality
of our analysis.

b. igl(1)

759

as for any poincare representation, reducible or not, all we need is the lightcone
spin operators, given for the general case in subsection xiia1. in subsection xiia2
we saw that the osp(1,1|2) generators followed immediately from just a change in
notation. the igl(1) generators were then found in subsection xiib1 by a uni-
tary transformation and solving half the constraints of gl(1|1); the net result was
equivalent to applying gauge conditions to the original osp(1,1|2) generators:

j = ij|=0,+=1,

q = j|=0,+=1

for the string, the gauge condition + = 1 simply removes the last vestige of x +,
whose oscillator modes were already eliminated by the string lightcone gauge. on the
other hand, the condition  = 0 makes x = x(+)+x() the sum of two conformally
covariant objects: with the elimination of the linear  term in the expansion of x,
x() are periodic in their arguments, and have the usual mode expansion in terms of
exponentials only (no linear term).

as a result, the decomposition of q as obtained from the lightcone becomes
trivial (j was easy anyway, since its quadratic): relabeling the result for the strings
lightcone lorentz generators from subsection xia3,

j = iz

d

(x

(where now the i comes from using the antihermitian form of the lorentz spin),
.
x() = x() to convert
separating
the  derivative into a  derivative, integrating by parts, and applying the denition

x into its () pieces, using their chirality

to x, we obtain

p() = 12 (

x  x)

2x

q = ir 2
p + = 2p+  p  = i

in this form we can easily apply the virasoro constraint, as solved in the lightcone,

p 2 = 0,

22

( p i)2

where we have applied + = 1. finally, we relabel
x() = c()

for purposes of identication with the usual brst procedure in terms of ghosts c and
antighosts b (see subsections xia4-5); comparison of the (equal-time) commutation
relations then gives the further identication

of particular interest is the massless level: as mentioned in subsection xib5,
using the fact that the hilbert space of the closed string is the direct product of the
hilbert spaces of open strings gives a simple analysis of the massless states of any
closed string, since the massless states of any open string are given by a vector (multi-
plet) plus perhaps some scalars in the nonsupersymmetric case. to nd the complete
o-shell structure, including auxiliary elds and ghosts, we can either take the direct
product of the two lightcone representations and then add 2+2 dimensions, or rst
add the 2+2 dimensions and then take the direct product of the two osp(d1,1|2)
representations. in the supersymmetric case the latter is more convenient, since the
procedure of adding dimensions to superspace is not yet understood, but quantization
of the vector multiplet is (at least for n=1, and probably for n=2, in d=4).

b. igl(1)

761

for example, for the bosonic closed string we just multiply two osp vectors,
producing a tensor tij, which we can decompose into its symmetric traceless part
hij (graviton plus ghosts), antisymmetric part bij (axion plus ghosts), and trace 
(physical scalar):

tij|ji  |ii  hij = t(ij]  2

d2ijtk

k,

bij = t[ij),

(see subsection xiia5.) however, we know that string theory prefers to treat elds
in the string gauge for weyl invariance, where the action (kinetic term) is not diag-
onalized in the elds (until coordinate invariance is xed also). this is understood
from this direct product structure: the natural string elds are

t(ab)
t[ab]
t



graviton
axion
dilaton (t-duality invariant)

string gauge : 
normal gauge :

since duality aects only the x modes, while the diagonal elds (representations of

bab = t[ab]

show that the above osp analysis is consistent with the diagonalizing eld
redenitions of the low-energy string action found in exercise xib5.2. explain
the result in terms of the redenitions

g  e2,

2gmn  ggmn

in the heterotic case, as mentioned in subsection xib6, we take the product of
the real prepotential plus two chiral ghosts of super yang-mills with the usual vector
plus two scalar ghosts of bosonic yang-mills:

(v  )  (aa  c) = ha  (v  a)    ()

the result is a vector prepotential ha describing the physical supergravity and tensor
multiplets (in a string gauge, g = 1), a chiral scalar compensator (superdilaton) 
appropriate for old minimal supergravity, rst-generation ghosts (sp(2) doublets)
v and a, and second-generation ghosts (an sp(2) triplet, for the tensor multiplet)
(). if the vector is accompanied by scalars, the closed string also has additional
vector multiplets:

(v  )  i = vi  i

762

xii. mechanics

background elds in string theory can be treated similarly to the previous sub-
section: since any open string includes yang-mills, we again choose the yang-mills
ghost as the vacuum state. (in the bosonic case, even the tachyon can be obtained
from it, by what would have been considered an annihilation operator with respect to
the tachyonic vacuum.) again vertex operators can be considered as additions to the
brst operator, are in the brst operator cohomology, create states (in the state co-
homology) from the vacuum, etc. for strings, such operators are local functions of the
string variables: they are associated with coupling an external eld at a particular
value of  (and  ). these local, fermionic vertex operators with ghost number 1 (so
they can be added to q) can be derived from related, integrated, bosonic operators
with vanishing ghost number:

[q,w] = 0,

w =z w  [q, w ] = v 

 {q, v } = 0  {q, v } = 0

(usually it is convenient to use conformal eld theory methods for such methods, so

we use the notation of subsection xib7, which mainly means dropping s.) thusr v

is the only part of v in the cohomology, the rest being a brst variation: moving
v to a dierent value of  is a gauge transformation. thus v () has explicit 
dependence, while q does not:

qi = q + v ()

corresponding to a vertex local in  (as found in subsection xib7).

the operators w are those that appear with the gauge-xed hamiltonian:

hi = h + w () = {qi, } = {q, } + {v, }

where the gauge-xing operator is

 =z (b + f ),

2 = 0

the rst term in  giving the usual 1
2(p2 + m 2) in h, while f is left arbitrary (as long
as 2 = 0 is preserved) to allow more general gauges. thus, either of v or w can be
derived from the other:

v  = [q, w ],

w = {, v }

( {q, v } = [, w ] = 0)

in general we have

2 [ g(1), (2)] = (2  1)(2) + w(2  1)(2)
i 1

b. igl(1)

763

 i[h, ] = ,

h =z g

for any conformally covariant operator, so assuming v is one,

g() = {q, (b + f )()},

gi() = {qi, (b + f )()}

 [q, w ] = [q,{, v }] = [{q, }, v ] = [h, v ] = v 

in agreement with the previous. (similarly, we can plug v  = [q, w ] into {, v } to
show the consistency of w = {, v }.) in the notation of subsection xib7, g are the
conformal generators t, and gi are t, while

{v (0), (b + f )()} =fw () = 2(  0)w (0)

the simplest examples come from adding a background directly to the virasoro

operators (as for gravity in subsection xib4): then for the bosonic string

v = cw (x, p ),

q =z c( 1

2

p 2 + icb),

 =z b,

if we assume that w has conformal weight 1 with respect to the gauge-xed conformal
(virasoro) generators, so that w is conformally invariant, then v has conformal
weight 0.

9. relation to osp(1,1|2)

for comparison to osp(1,1|2), we perform a unitarity (gauge) transformation on
the igl(1) action. (the most general osp(1,1|2) expressions are given at the end of
subsection xiia2.) we rst dene an almost-inverse of s: since s annihilates
states with s3 = s, where we dene

s s = 4s(s + 1),

 1

2

s3|si = 2s3|si

(so that s and s3 take their usual integer or half-integer values), we can dene s1
such that

s1 s = 1  s3,s,
s s1 s = s,

s s1 = 1  s3,s
s1 s s1 = s1

we then apply the transformation

q  qdiag = uqu1

q = ck + q + sb,

ln u = c[{ s1,q}  s1 sq s1]

764

xii. mechanics

the exponent of u is nilpotent from the c, so it generates only a linear term, u =
1 + ln u. using the commutation relations from subsection xiia2

[ s,q] = 0,

(q)2 = k s

we nd

qdiag = cs3,s(k + q s1q)s3,s + (cbqs3,s + bcs3,sq) + sb

now we apply the identity

[ s3, a] = 0  s3,sas3,s = as0

since any matrix element between hs, s3|...|s, s3i gives s = s3 = s3 = s  s =
s = 0, as well as the facts

sqs0 = [ s,q]s0 = 2iqs0  s1qs0 =  1

(note that in a product of the form t  a state of eigenvalue s3 multiplies one of
eigenvalue s3, since ( s3) = ( s3)t =  s3.) we now see that in this action only the
s = 0 (physical) part of  appears in the  term, while only the s3 = s (minimal)
part (including physical) appears in the  term. the only part of  that appears in
the  term is the s3 = s (minimal) part of  (the antields to the corresponding

ones in ), while all, but only, the remaining (nonminimal) part of  appears in
the  term. in particular, the  term is recognized as the osp(1,1|2) action of
subsection xiia3. the terms involving  can be eliminated by s gauge invariance
and eld equation, and  contains no propagating degrees of freedom (elds with
equations of motion), as can be seen by the methods used to analyze the cohomology
in subsection xiib4. however, the auxiliary elds , and the ghosts in (the s 6= 0
part of)  to which they couple, are useful in gauge xing, as well see in the next
section.

although the quantum mechanical brst operator is clearly useful for gauge x-
ing, its relation to the second-quantized brst we applied in chapter vi is not obvious,
since the latter brst operator does not include the gauge-invariant action. here we
relate the two, and extend the former to interacting eld theories. in particular, we
show how the q action leads directly to the gauge-xed kinetic term as simply as
it led to the gauge-invariant one, without applying any transformations.

1. antibracket

in the usual hamiltonian formalism we work in a phase space (q, p) on which is
dened a poisson bracket, useful for studying symmetry properties and equations of
motion in the classical theory, and for relating to the commutator of the quantum
theory (see subsections ia1-2). we want to interpret the present case of interest as
an analogous phase space, for which the elds  (in  =   ic) correspond to q
and the antields  to p. this automatically follows from the lightcone commutator
of subsection xiia1, by the same steps used to derive the igl(1) algebra and inner
product

h|i = i(1)z dx dc  t (x, c)(1)j(c)(x, c)

in subsections xiib1-2: we thus dene this generalization of the poisson bracket (see
subsection ia2) in terms of the inner product as

(f [], g[]) = f  g,



i (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)
 = ij* 



j+

where we have expanded the column vector  over a basis in the usual way (see
subsections ib1,5),

 = |iii,

hi|ji = ij = (1)iji,

t = ihi|
(ij )* = ji,

ikjk = j
i

etc., and the indices i, j (not to be confused with the ghost-number operator j(c)
appearing in the denition of the inner product above) run over all indices on the
eld, which determine the statistics of the corresponding component as (1)i. (thus
 is always bosonic, the statistics of the elds coming always from expansion over |ii.)
this generalized commutator ( , ) is called an antibracket because of the unusual
statistics associated with it, following from the same unusual statistics of the inner
product. (the ordering of indices on ij in the antibracket is the opposite of usual

c. gauge fixing

767

to take into account the extra sign factor from the intervention of the anticommuting
|  between the two s.) plugging in the denition of the inner product, we have
more explicitly

 = iz dx dc




ji(1)j(c)



j (x, c)

i(x, c)

note that while the inner product is dened between two functions of the coordinates,
the antibracket is dened between two functionals of , f and g, which dont depend
explicitly on (x, c) (although we can specialize to cases where they depend on other
values of the coordinates (x, c)). thus the orbital term cb in j(c) acts only on the
argument c of j (x, c) (and not on g), while the spin term s3 acts only on the index
j of j (x, c).

we have used the fact that / is antihermitian, as follows from the fact that
the graded commutator between it and  is always a commutator, since they always
have opposite statistics:



i(x, c)

=(cid:20)



i(x, c)



i(x, c)

j (x, c) =(cid:18)
j (x, c)(cid:19)
, j(x, c)(cid:21) = j
i (x  x)(c  c)
(cid:19)
(cid:19)t
=(cid:18) 
 (cid:18) 
, f(cid:27)
f(cid:19)
=(cid:20)f,
=(cid:20) 

(cid:27) = f




= 









thus,

(cid:18) 



other properties of the bracket follow directly from those of the inner product:

(1)(f,g) = (1)f +g+1

(f, ga) = (f, g)a,

(af, g) = a(f, g)

(f, g) = (1)(f +1)(g+1)(g, f )

(f, gh) = (f, g)h + (1)(f +1)gg(f, h)
(1)(f +1)(h+1)(f, (g, h)) + cyc. = 0

(f, g) = (g, f)

(for some commuting or anticommuting constant a). thus, the bracket has the exact
opposite symmetry as the inner product (as is the case with the usual brackets):

it would be symmetric in its two arguments if not for the r dc that sits eectively

768

xii. mechanics

between the two arguments. most of the properties follow from this fact, and that the
signs obtained from pushing things around are determined by moving things naively
while treating the  ,  in the middle as anticommuting. furthermore, the existence
of a bracket with these properties allows the denition of a lie derivative,

lab  (a, b)

exercise xiic1.1

find all the usual properties of this derivative (statistics, linearity, distribu-
tivity, hermiticity, algebra, etc.), and relate to the usual lie derivative.

we also have functional identities such as



i(x, c)h|i = ij

i (1)j(c)i(x, c)

(i(x, c), f []) = i(1)j(c)ij



j (x, c)

f []

from which follow

(i(x, c), j (x, c)) = i(1)j(c)ij(c  c)(x  x) = i(1)s3
as well as

ij(c + c)(x  x)

((x, c),h|i) =  (x, c),

(h|i,h|i) = h|i

here  and  are wave functions in the same space as , but need not be taken as
bosonic (or real): we can even take them as functionals of  when applying the chain
rule, using the above expressions for the terms where the /s dont act on them.

expressions quadratic in  will be used to perform the second-quantized (or just

classical eld theoretic) version of linear rst-quantized transformations:

oa  1

2h|ai  (oa,ob) = o[a,b},

a = (,oa)

df = z dx dc (1)idi 

i f  (oa, f ) =z dx dc (1)i(ai)


i f

where a and b must satisfy

[(1)j(c)a]t = (1)j(c)a  a = (1)j(c)at (1)j(c)

to give nontrivial contributions when appearing symmetrically between the two fac-
tors of . corresponding group elements come from exponentiating bosonic rst-
quantized generators, yielding fermionic second-quantized generators:

f = (oa, f ) = loaf  f = eloa f

c. gauge fixing

769

(1)a = 1  (1)oa = 1  (oa, f ) = (f,oa)

clearly, the latter relations must hold when replacing oa with their nonlinear second-
quantized generalizations. we then nd (also for bosonic a)

a = (,oa) = (oa, )

where the minus sign is the usual from translating rst-quantized to second-quantized
language (see subsection ic1).

expanding (, ) in c as

i = i  icij (1)s3 j

we nd

( i(x), j(x)) = (j (x), i(x)) = j

i (x  x)

this allows us to reexpress the antibracket as

 = z dx (1)i



 i


i +



i



 i

for example, the antibrackets of the component elds for the vector are

 = |iii = |ii[jiajic(1)s3 ai] = (|aiaai|ic +i|i c)ic(|ai aa|i c|i c)

( ai(x), aj(x)) = (aj(x), ai(x)) = j
 ( aa, ab) = ab,

( c, c) = ,

i (x  x)
( c, c) = 

where now i refers to the osp(d1,1|2) index (and we use c = a, c = a,
c = a, c = a).

2. zjbv

to prove gauge independence of the path integral, its useful to draw an anal-
ogy of relativistic quantum mechanical brst to second-quantized brst. (well see
below that this is not just an analogy, but an equivalence.) translating the brst
quantization of subsection via2 into path integral language, the general lagrangian
path integral for brst quantization in quantum physics is

a =z dq eis

,

s = s + {q, }

770

xii. mechanics

where q is all coordinates, including ghosts. while s and  depend only on q, the
brst operator is linear in the conjugate momenta p  it generates a coordinate
transformation:

[q, qm} = iqqm  q = (qqm)pm

here the index m includes all dependence of q, including time. (we saw a more
explicit expression of this result in subsection via2, assuming the constraints gi are
themselves linear in the physical momenta.) we also have

[q, s] = 0

where s can include not only the gauge-invariant action, but arbitrary additional
gauge-invariant pieces. such pieces can be used to construct states in the brst
cohomology from the vacuum. (this is the path-integral translation of the operator
construction given in subsection via1.) it can also include pure brst variations,
{q, 0}. thus, to prove gauge independence of a, we need only prove the vanishing
of its variation under innitesimal change of ,

z dq eis{q, } = 0

but this is trivial, since q acts as a total derivative, and [q, s] = 0. more generally,
we require only

0 = 1 

q  i[q, s] = i(qqm)


 m  (qqm)ms

q means the derivatives in q act backwards onto the
where m = /qm, and 1 
1 (and itself), as found by integration by parts. in cases we have considered (and
q and [q, s] separately vanish. more generally, since there is a 1/h
almost always), 1
multiplying s implicitly, nonvanishing values would require a quantum correction
to s. we can also write this condition as

furthermore, we can write

eis q = 0

q = i

1 

2q

pmqm

these manipulations can be applied to the eld theory expressions j for group
generators, as found in subsection xiia1 for the lightcone: the brst operator as
found from these generators is

s = 1

2h|iqi, q2 = 0  (s, s) = 0

c. gauge fixing

771

then a unitary transformation can be implemented by exponentiating the innitesi-
mal transformation

q = [g, q]  s = 1

2h|i(q)i = (g, s),

g = 1

2h|gi

q = egqeg  s = 1

2h|iqi = elg s

we want to implement gauge xing by performing a unitary transformation on

q and then evaluating s at the antields  = 0:

a =z d eis

|=0,

s = els  sgf = (els)|=0

by similar manipulations to the brst case, we see that gauge independence means

0 =z d eis(s, ) = iz d (eis, )

where we evaluate this expression at  = 0, and we have again included arbitrary
gauge-invariant pieces in s. we thus obtain gauge independence from (s, s) = 0, or
more generally (again using integration by parts)

0 =z dx (1)i

eis =z dx (1)i

2 (s, s)

this is the approach to brst of zinn-justin, batalin, and vilkovisky (zjbv).

exercise xiic2.1

find the unitary transformation, in zjbv language, that transforms the
untransformed action for the massive vector (that which gives the gauge-
invariant action upon dropping antields) into the action that has only the
vector eld (and not the scalar) upon dropping antields.

writing the brst transformations in this second-quantized zjbv notation will
allow us to gauge x interacting theories (found by adding interaction terms to the
free s) in a gauge-independent way. in particular, it proves the equivalence of the
manifestly unitary lightcone gauge (which has no ghosts, only physical degres of free-
dom) to the manifestly lorentz covariant fermi-feynman gauges (where the kinetic
operator is simply  m2). specically, the q action is already unitarily trans-
formed to the fermi-feynman gauge: keeping just the  terms, we have for a bosonic
theory

sf f = s|=0 = z dx dc 1

2t (1)j1c 1

2( m2)
in other words, the fermi-feynman kinetic term is just the sum over all elds (but
not antields) of a  m2 term (using the osp(d1,1|2)-invariant inner product:

2( m2) = z dx 1

2 t (1)s3 1

772

xii. mechanics

the (1)s3 is just a sign, and can be absorbed by a eld redenition). this can
also be seen from the result for the complete q action after dropping the antield
terms: for example, for a vector the gauge-xed (free) action is simply (see subsection
xiib3)

lf f =  1

4 aa aa  i c 1

2 c

(the fermi-feynman gauge for fermions also gives a  m2 kinetic term, but with
an innite number of ghosts; this may be useful for supersymmetry.)

exercise xiic2.2

lets again consider arbitrary-rank antisymmetric tensors (see exercises
xiia5.1 and xiib3.1):

a find the fermi-feynman actions.

b do the same for the massive case. (note: there are more elds.)

on the other hand, we saw in subsection xiib9 that a unitary transformation,
and evaluation at  = 0, gave the gauge-invariant osp(1,1|2) action in terms of just
the physical elds:

0 = 1

sdiag =z dx [ 1

2h|c[{s1,q}  s1sqs1]i  s = sdiag
2t (1)s3
2t (k + 1

4qq)s0 + it (1)s31s3,sq  1
4qq)s0

sgi = sdiag|=0 =z dx 1

2t (k + 1

s]

in the usual gauge-xing approach, we would start with sdiag and do the inverse
transformation to obtain the fermi-feynman gauge:

 = 0  sf f = (el0 sdiag)|=0

the same  can be used in the interacting case, since the eect on the quadratic
piece of the action will be the same. thus, to apply the usual zjbv procedure we
can either start with sdiag and apply some  6= 0 sucient to x the gauge, or we can
start with s (the one we found from quantum mechanical brst) and apply some
equivalent , or no  at all (for fermi-feynman gauge).

to compare with the lightcone gauge, we start with

slc =z dx [ 1

4 (1)s3

  i(1)s31s+]
and make a further unitary transformation, of the form  =r dx 1

which was itself obtained by unitary transformation from s (see subsection xiib4),
2a , that has

c. gauge fixing

773

the eect    + a  for a such that all terms in   containing auxiliary elds,
and thus also pure-gauge elds, are canceled. for this transformed slc we then have

slc,diag|=0 = z dx 1

4 (sab)

where the projection operator (sab) picks out the singlets of sab (a = (, )),
i.e., the transverse (physical) degrees of the light cone. a similar procedure can be
applied in the interacting case.

for the example of the vector:

ln u = i 1

2 c(|ih+| + |+ih|)(+)1

qlc = 1

2c  s+  qlc,diag = 1
2c
llc  llc,diag =  1

4ai ai + c+a  i a+c

|iihi|  s+

which has just the transverse (lightcone) degrees of freedom when the antields are
dropped:

3. brst

llc,gf =  1

4 ai ai

in subsection via2, we saw that brst could be used to gauge x by adding a
brst variation to the gauge-invariant lagrangian. in that case, physical states are
those that are not only in the brst cohomology, but also satisfy the equations of
motion.

on the other hand, for relativistic mechanics we saw that the equations of motion
are rather redundant, since  is unphysical, and so p2(+m2) = 0 is already included
as a constraint, and contained in the quantum mechanical brst operator. in fact,
we have seen how in the most general case of a free eld the correct spectrum is
specied by just the cohomology of the quantum mechanical brst operator.

we therefore want to identify the quantum mechanical brst cohomology condi-
tion with the combination of the second-quantized brst cohomology condition and
the wave equation. this essentially has been accomplished in subsection xiic2 by
decomposing qdiag with respect to c, as well now see by some further analysis.

from subsection xiib9 we have

qdiag = c(k + 1

4qq)s0 + (cbqs3,s + bcs3,sq) + sb

where the rst term gives lgi in terms of the physical part (s = 0) of , the second
term gives the minimal brst transformations in terms of the minimal (anti)elds,

774

xii. mechanics

and the last term adds the nonminimal stu needed for xing to general gauges. in
particular, we see that the brst transformation of the physical elds are

(s0)  s0q = s0q(s,1/2s3,1/2)

(note that this diers somewhat from the expression found from q, since the trans-
formation to qdiag is eectively a redenition of , adding to it a piece proportional
to an operator on .)

thus the only occurrences of the physical elds in qdiag are in the term that
gives the gauge-invariant action and the term that gives their brst transformation;
the remaining terms introduce nonminimal elds, as well as account for the brst
transformations of the ghosts. but this is the denition of brst: take the classical
action in terms of physical elds, construct the brst transformation from the gauge
transformation that leaves the classical action invariant, add terms to the brst
operator that insure its nilpotency on these ghosts, and add nonminimal terms to
allow gauge xing. we have just seen that qdiag is exactly of this structure, where
gauge xing gives the desired fermi-feynman gauge by unitary transformation to q
(which becomes a canonical transformation in second-quantized language, using the
antibracket).

all that is left to see is how the zjbv combination of the gauge-invariant action
with the brst operator is equivalent to ordinary brst. expanding in antields,
zjbv gives the gauge xed action as

s = s0 +m(qm)+nmnm  sgf = s0 +(/m)(qm)+(/nm)(/nm)
where we have used the fact that the three terms in qdiag contain only the physical,
minimal (m; including physical), and nonminimal (nm) elds, respectively. in
the usual zjbv and brst formalisms, derived from brst without antields, there
is no 2 term, since this generates a brst transformation

iqnm = (s, nm)  nm

one instead introduces further nonminimal elds, the nakanishi-lautrup elds,
such that

and use an extended gauge-xing function

qnm = n l

 =  + nmn l

c. gauge fixing

775

then the gauge xed action is

sgf = s0 + {q, } = s0 + (/m)(qm) + (/nm)n l + 2

n l

after eliminating the nl elds by their (algebraic) equations of motion, we obtain
the same result as found from zjbv. (of course, the nl elds can also be introduced
directly into the zjbv formalism, but are redundant for purposes of nding fermi-
feynman gauges.)

consider the special case of yang-mills: generalizing our results for free yang-
mills to the interacting case, making use of the brst transformations of subsection
via4, we have

lzjbv = 1

8 (fab)2 + c 2 + i a  [, c]  cc 2

the basic antibrackets are

( aa, ab) = ab,

( c, c) = ,

( c, c) = 

from the general relations we saw earlier, and the denition of s in terms of q for
the free case, we have

iq = (, s) = (s, )

since in the above we have pulled out factors to the left of the elds, as

 = |iii = |ii[jiaj  ic(1)s3 ai]

we pull them out of the left of the antibracket, to obtain

i(q)i = (s, i),

i(q )i = (s, i)

where as before (q)i, etc., means to evaluate the corresponding component of q
and introduce the corresponding signs for eectively pulling those factors to the left.
we then nd the previous results for the brst transformations of the elds (by
construction), but also those of the antields:

qaa = [a, c],
2 [b, fba] + i{c, aa},

q aa = i 1

qc = ic 2,

q c = 2i c
q c = [, a] + i[c, c],

q c = 0

(remember that the funny signs of the antibracket come from its symmetry, plus
treating the comma in ( , ) as anticommuting. note the generic terms i[c, }.)

exercise xiic3.1

generalize the above results for the action and brst transformations with
antields when yang-mills is coupled to matter.

776

xii. mechanics

brst was described in a dierent way in subsection via4: here we apply quan-
tum mechanical brst, and nd it equivalent to applying the zjbv form of brst
to second-quantization. the zjbv action consists of the gauge-invariant action, plus
the antields times the brst transformations of the elds, plus (antield)2 terms.
the dierence between the brst transformations obtained by the general methods
of subsection via1 as applied to second-quantization, and those found in this chap-
ter by applying osp methods to rst-quantization of relativistic systems, is that the
nakanishi-lautrup eld is treated as a eld in the former approach and as an an-
tield in the latter. the two give equivalent results: the latter uses fewer elds,
but is slightly more restricted in choices of gauge; however, this restriction is avoided
in practice. (more nonminimal elds can be added to allow more general gauge
choices in either case.) for example, the zjbv action for the former treatment of
yang-mills can be obtained from that for the latter by the replacement

the gauge-xed action is the canonically transformed action (with respect to the
antibracket) evaluated at vanishing antields:
