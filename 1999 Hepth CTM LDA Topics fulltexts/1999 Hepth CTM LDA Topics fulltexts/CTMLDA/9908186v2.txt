abstract

we present static solutions to einsteins equations corresponding to branes at var-
ious angles intersecting in a single 3-brane. such congurations may be useful for
building models with localized gravity via the randall-sundrum mechanism. we nd
that such solutions may exist only if the mechanical forces acting on the junction
exactly cancel.
in addition to this constraint there are further conditions that the
parameters of the theory have to satisfy. we nd that at least one of these involves
only the brane tensions and cosmological constants, and thus can not have a dynamical
origin. we present these conditions in detail for two simple examples.

we discuss the nature of the cosmological constant problem in the framework of
these scenarios, and outline the desired features of the brane congurations which may
bring us closer towards the resolution of the cosmological constant problem.

1 introduction

the principal challenge facing particle theorists is to understand the physics at energy scales
of a few tev. it seems inevitable that the standard model be amended at these scales. the
most popular scenario is that the world is supersymmetric, with the scale of supersymmetry
breaking being around a few hundred gev. thus in this scenario all superpartners would
become visible around the tev scale. this possibility would explain why there is such a big
hierarchy between the weak and the planck scales. thus the bulk of the eorts in the past
twenty years has been devoted to modifying particle physics above the weak scale in order to
accommodate this huge hierarchy. very recently it has been understood that there exists a
dierent way towards reconciling particle physics with gravity at high energies, by radically
changing our ideas how gravity will work above the tev scale [1, 2, 3]. most notably, arkani-
hamed, dimopoulos and dvali suggested [1], that in fact the fundamental planck scale itself
could be as low as a few tev, if there are large extra dimensions. this way the problem
of the hierarchy between the planck and the weak scales is translated into the question of
why the size of the extra dimensions is much larger than its natural scale of 1/tev. the
fundamental new ingredient in this idea is that the reason why we do not see the eects of
the large extra dimensions is because the standard model elds live on a 3-brane, and the
only elds which can propagate in the extra dimensions are the gravitons.

recently, randall and sundrum (rs) further developed on these ideas by noting, that our
understanding of kaluza-klein (kk) gravity models has been largely limited to factorizable
metrics where the components of the metric tensor do not depend on the coordinates of the
extra dimension [4, 5]. rs noted that if this is not the case, the properties of compactication
may change radically. in particular [4], following the idea that the standard model elds may
live on a 3-brane, rs considered two 3-branes embedded into 4+1 dimensional spacetime,
with the extra dimension being a compact s 1/z2 manifold (this latter motivated by [3]).
the bulk cosmological constant was chosen to be negative, while the tensions of the two
branes are of opposite signs. rs found that if a particular ne-tuning relation between the
cosmological constant and the brane tensions is obeyed, there will be a static solution to
einsteins equations, which is given by two slices of anti-de sitter (ads) space glued together
at the location of the branes. the metric tensor has a non-trivial exponential dependence
on the coordinate y along the extra dimension. this exponential determines the natural
mass scale at the location y. thus it is not inconceivable, that while the mass scale at
the brane with positive tension is 1019 gev, due to the exponential suppression it might
be a few tev on the brane with negative tension, thereby possibly solving the hierarchy
problem [4, 7]. rs further noted [5], that the brane with positive tension supports a single
bound state (zero mode) of gravitons, thereby trapping gravity to this wall. this is a very
appealing feature of the theory, since in this case one might as well move the second brane
with negative tension far away (in fact making the size of the extra dimension innitely
large), while newtons law of gravity is still correctly reproduced on the brane due to the
trapped zero mode. the idea of having non-compact extra dimensions is also explained in

similar domain-wall solutions in the context of supergravity theories have been considered in [6].

1

refs. [8, 9] since the trapping of the zero mode crucially depends on the fact that one has
a brane of co-dimension one, one would think that this feature of trapping gravity on a
3-brane can only hold if one has a 4+1 dimensional spacetime. however, arkani-hamed,
dimopoulos, dvali and kaloper have pointed out [10], that if one considers intersecting
branes of co-dimension one (intersecting orthogonally in a single 3-brane) one can still nd
static solutions to einsteins equations, which will trap gravity to the intersection of the
branes. further solutions to einsteins equation have been given in [11], within the context
of supergravity in [12, 13], and the relation to string theory and holography has been
explained in [14]. the cosmological aspects of the rs models have been studied in [15, 16],
while the issue of bulk scalars and stabilization of the radius in [17, 18].

in this paper we consider more general intersections of branes. in particular, we discuss
brane junctions, that is intersections of semi-innite branes intersecting in a single 3-
brane. we will mainly concentrate on junctions of 4-branes, but we expect that it will
be straightforward to generalize the algorithm of gluing sectors of static ads spacetimes
together to higher dimensions. we nd, that brane junctions can yield static solutions to
einsteins equations if some ne-tuning conditions between the tensions and the cosmological
constants are satised. moreover, the balance of mechanical forces on the junction arising
from the brane tensions is a necessary condition for the existence of the static solution. we
present these conditions for some simple examples in detail.

a crucial ingredient of the rs solution is the ne-tuning between the brane tension and
the bulk cosmological constant, which insures that there is a static universe with the eective
4-dimensional cosmological constant vanishing. thus the cosmological constant problem in
four dimensions is translated into the problem of the tuning between the brane tension and
the fundamental (ve dimensional) cosmological constant. in the case of branes intersecting
at angles one expects that there will be similar relations, which also involve the angles of the
branes. a simple way of understanding the cosmological constant problem would then be to
imagine that one starts with a setup of branes whose angles do not satisfy the required tuning
relation. then one lets the system relax, and perhaps it would settle to a conguration where
the angles of the branes take the right value, thus providing at 4 dimensional universe with
a vanishing cosmological constant. for this scenario to be viable, one would need to nd a
solution of intersecting branes, where all ne-tuning conditions can be satised by the choice
of angles between the branes. moreover, this conguration should be a ground state of the
system once the dynamics of the branes is included. unfortunately, as we will see, this is
not the case in the solutions based on junctions presented in this paper. there is always at
least one remaining ne-tuning involving only the tensions and the cosmological constants.
one may hope however, that a more clever conguration of branes may posses the necessary
features and thus provide a dynamical interpretation of the cosmological constant problem.
this paper is organized as follows: in section 2 we review the rs solution by considering
a 3-brane in 4+1 dimensional spacetime separating two domains with dierent cosmological
constants. in section 3 we give our general setup for brane junctions in 5+1 dimensions and
discuss the general algorithm of nding the solutions to einsteins equations and the ne-
tuning relations. in section 4 we work out the solutions and ne-tuning relations in detail
for two simple junctions. in section 5 we summarize our observations about the cosmological

2

constant problem, and we conclude in section 6.

2 review of the randall-sundrum solution

we rst briey review the original randall-sundrum (rs) solution by presenting a slightly
generalized version of it.
in this setup we have a single 3-brane (with positive tension
v ) embedded into 4+1 dimensional spacetime, where the branes divide the space into two
domains: one with cosmological constant 1, the other with 2 (both of them negative).
this setup is depicted in fig. 1. the original rs solution for 1 = 2 =  is given by

ds2 = e2m|y|abdxadxb  dy2,

(2.1)

where a, b = 0, 1, 2, 3 are the coordinates of the four dimensional spacetime, while y is the
coordinate along the (innite) extra dimension. in order for this to be the solution to the
einstein equations, the parameter m has to satisfy

m2 = 

2

6

,

(2.2)

where 2 is newtons constant in ve dimensions (2 = 1
m 3
planck scale), and the tension of the brane has to be tuned to be



where m is the ve dimensional

v = s

6
2 .

(2.3)

for the generalizations to be presented below it turns out to be useful following [10] to
redene the coordinates such that one obtains a conformally at metric:

in these coordinates

where

dy = em|y|dz

ds2 = 2(z)dxdx,

1(z) = m|z| + 1,

(2.4)

(2.5)

(2.6)

if one wants to have the location of the brane to be at z = 0. in these coordinates it is easy
to see why (2.5) solves the einstein equations with a negative cosmological constant  and
a brane with tension v at z = 0.

the einstein tensor for a metric of the form g = 2g in d dimensions is given by

g = g + (d  2)"  log   log     log  + g   2 log  +

d  3

(2.7)
where the covariant derivatives  are evaluated with respect to the metric g. since in our
case the metric is conformally at, g = , all covariant derivatives can be replaced by

domains with dierent cosmological constants.

ordinary derivatives, and for the same reason g = 0. for the case 1(z) = m|z| + 1
one can easily see that the einstein equations at an arbitrary point of the bulk (z 6= 0)
are satised if 6m2 = 2, since the energy-momentum tensor in the bulk is given by
t bulk
 = 2(z). the singularities in the second derivatives of  result in the additional
term

6m(z)(z) diag(1, 1, 1, 1, 0)

(2.8)

in the einstein tensor, which must be balanced by the term from energy-momentum tensor
of the brane on the right hand side of einsteins equations

2(z)v (z) diag(1, 1, 1, 1, 0),

(2.9)

thus yielding 6m = 2v .

this solution represents two slices of anti-de sitter space (the solution of einsteins
equations with negative cosmological constant) glued together at z = 0. the brane represents
the source necessary for tting the two pieces together. now it is trivial to generalize this
solution to the case with two domains with dierent cosmological constants. it is a space
with two slices of ads spaces with dierent ms glued together. thus one expects that a
conformally at metric (2.5) with

1(z) = m1z(z)  m2z(z) + 1,

(2.10)

where (z) = 1 for z > 0 and (z) = 0 for z < 0 is the heaviside step-function. einsteins
equations in the bulk require that

and the tension of the brane is determined by

3(m1 + m2) = 2v.

(2.13)

clearly by construction the solution we found is static. however, we included the brane
as an internal source nailed at z = 0. the dynamics of the brane is not included in this
simple description, and thus it is impossible to determine if the solution is stable against
small uctuations.

the above example already suggests how one can further generalize these solutions by
tting slices of ads space with dierent cosmological constants together. indeed, arkani-
hamed, dimopoulos, dvali and kaloper have showed, that one can nd solutions corre-
sponding to orthogonally intersecting branes. in the next section we show that one can also
nd solutions corresponding to the junction of semi-innite branes intersecting in a single 3-
brane. we will concentrate on the case of 4-branes embedded in 5+1 dimensional spacetime,
but we expect that generalizations to higher dimensions based on the algorithm described
below should be straightforward.

3 the general setup

we consider a junction of half (semi-innite in one direction) 4-branes in 5+1 spacetime
dimensions. these branes intersect in a single 3-brane, and the tension of the ith brane is vi.
the bulk cosmological constant in the region between the ith and (i+1)st brane is taken to be
i. this general setup is depicted in fig. 2. we want to t slices of static 5+1 dimensional
anti-de sitter (ads) space together such that the resulting full solution exactly corresponds
to the setup given in fig. 2. a patch of 5+1 dimensional ads space can be described by the
conformally at metric

ds2 = 2(x, y)dxdx,

(3.1)

5

where x0,1,2,3 are the coordinates of the 4 dimensional spacetime, and x4  x, x5  y are the
coordinates in the extra dimensions. the conformal factor is given by

1(x, y) = ~m  ~x + 1,

(3.2)

where ~x = (x, y), the parameters ~m = (mx, my) are related to (negative) the bulk cosmo-
logical constant  as m2
10 , and 2 is newtons constant in six dimensions
(2 = 1/m 4
 , where m is the fundamental planck scale in six dimensions). note that the re-
quirement that the conformal factor  is positive imposes certain inequalities on the possible
values of ~m in each ads patch.

y =  2

x + m2

in order to nd the full solution to einsteins equations we need to glue the s together

such that

- the metric tensor is continuous at the location of the branes
- the discontinuity in the derivatives along the branes reproduces the energy momentum

tensor of the brane with given tension vi rotated into the appropriate direction.

it is convenient to write the conformal factor in a space composed of k ads patches as

1 = 1 +

k

xi=1

( ~mi  ~x) (~ni1  ~x) (~ni  ~x) ,

(3.3)

where ~ni = ( sin i, cos i) is a unit vector in the x4  x5 plane normal to the ith brane, and
i is the angle between the brane and the coordinate axis. clearly, one linear combination of
angles is an unphysical parameter corresponding to the overall rotation of the conguration.
thus we can choose the coordinate system such that 1 = 0. we conclude that the ansatz
(3.3) depends on k vectors ~mi and k  1 angles, altogether 3k  1 parameters.

we now turn to the energy-momentum tensor of the conguration of k ads patches
separated by branes. in the bulk of a given patch the energy momentum tensor is given by
t bulk,i
 = i2. thus at the generic point the energy-momentum tensor can be written as

t bulk

xi=1

i 2 (~ni1  ~x) (~ni  ~x)  .

the energy-momentum tensor of a 4-brane rotated by an angle  from the horizontal

(3.8)

the requirements that the singularities in the derivatives at the brane reproduce the brane

~ni .

(3.9)

to summarize, we found 3k equations on the 3k  1 parameters of the ansatz (3.1), (3.3).
therefore, generically the k bulk cosmological constants i and the k brane tensions vi need
to satisfy a single (but quite complicated) ne-tuning condition. we will discuss this ne
tuning condition in more detail in the particular examples in the following section. once
this ne-tuning condition is satised a static solution of the form (3.1), (3.3) exists and its
parameters are completely determined.

it is worth noting that (as should have been expected) the solution satises the re-
quirement that (classical) mechanical forces acting at the junction exactly balance. indeed
summing up equations (3.9) we nd

which can be rewritten as

vi ~ni = 0 ,

xi=1

~vi = 0 ,

xi=1

(3.10)

(3.11)

where ~vi = (vx,i, vy,i) = (vi cos i, vi sin i). the latter equation is exactly the condition of
vanishing force.

4 examples

below we will apply the formalism presented in the previous section to discuss two particular
examples in detail. the rst example will involve two 4-branes intersecting at an angle, with
dierent bulk cosmological constants in the four domains of spacetime, while the second
example will involve three semi-innite 4-branes intersecting in a single 3-brane (a triple
junction). we will give the necessary ne-tuning conditions in detail, and nd the metric
tensor in every sector of spacetime.

this is easy to see by going to a coordinate system in which the brane under consideration is horizontal,

so that the relevant parts of both the energy-momentum and the einstein tensors are diagonal.

4.1

4-branes intersecting at an angle

in our rst example we will consider two 4-branes embedded into a 5+1 dimensional space-
time. the tensions of the two branes are given by v1 and v2, and the four domains may have
dierent cosmological constants. the setup is given in fig. 3. note, that since we are consid-
ering innite 4-branes the condition on the forces balancing at the junction is automatically
satised, thus at this point the angle  between the branes is arbitrary.

following the general formalism of the previous section, we write the metric in the form

g = 2(x, y), where

1(x, y) =

f1(x, y)(y)(x cos   y sin ) + f2(x, y)(y)(y sin   x cos ) +
f3(x, y)(y)(y sin   x cos ) + f4(x, y)(y)(x cos   y sin ) + 1,

(4.1)

where 1, 2, 3, 4 label the four domains where the value of the cosmological constant is 1,2,3,4,
and the fi(x, y) are functions linear in x, y and positive everywhere inside the domain

the einstein equations in the bulk result in the conditions

fi(x, y) = mi,xx + mi,yy.

where we have used the notation i = 2
branes will give the conditions

10 i. the einstein equations at the position of the

m2y  m1y = v1 cos , m1x  m2x = v1 sin ,
m2y  m3y = v2,
m3y  m4y = v1 cos , m4x  m3x = v1 sin ,
m1y  m4y = v2,

m3x  m2x = 0,

m4x  m1x = 0,

(4.4)

8

where we have used the notation vi = 2
m1x, m1y, and  using the discontinuity equations as

4 vi. we can express all variables with the help of

m2x = m1x  v1 sin , m2y = m1y + v1 cos ,
m3x = m1x  v1 sin , m3y = m1y  v2 + v1 cos ,
m4x = m1x,

m4y = m1y  v2.

(4.5)

using these expressions the equations in the bulk can be rewritten as

m2
m2

1y = 1,

1x + m2
1x + (m1y  v2)2 = 4,

(m1x  v1 sin )2 + (m1y + v1 cos )2 = 2,
(m1x  v1 sin )2 + (m1y  v2 + v1 cos )2 = 3. (4.6)

from the equations involving 1 and 4 we learn that

m1y =

4  1 + v2

2

2v2

.

(4.7)

plugging this back into the other two equations and eliminating m1x we get that

cos  =

3  2 + 1  4

2v1v2

=

2
5

(3  2 + 1  4)

2v1v2

.

(4.8)

in particular, this relation implies, that in the case when the bulk cosmological constant is
isotropic (1 = 2 = 3 = 4) the only possible angle between the branes is /2. the
converse, however is not true, and branes can be orthogonal with cosmological constants
dierent in each sector. we now have two dierent expressions for m1x which can be obtained
from (4.6). equating them and substituting the values (4.7) for m1y and (4.8) for cos  we
obtain the ne-tuning condition

(1  2 + 3  4)(13  24) + v2
(1 + 2 + 3 + 4)v2

2(v2

2(1  2)(3  4) + v2

(4.9)

note, that the rst three terms vanish if all cosmological constants are set to be equal,
and one is left with the ne-tuning equation 2 = v2, implying 2v 2 =  16
5 , which
exactly reproduces the ne-tuning condition obtained in [10]. thus we nd that the existence
of the static solution determines the angle between branes uniquely, and moreover, there
is one ne-tuning condition involving the cosmological constants and the brane tensions.
for simplicity in our discussion we considered a specic case of innite branes. have we
considered semi-innite branes with dierent tensions, the solution would still exist subject
to a single (although more complicated) ne-tuning condition.

4.2 triple junction of semi-innite 4-branes

in our second example we will consider three semi-innite 4-branes embedded into a 5+1
dimensional spacetime, intersecting in a single 3-brane. the setup is depicted in fig. 4.
similarly to the previous example, we write the metric in the form g = 2(x, y), where

m1x  m2x = v1,

(4.13)

where again we have used the notation vi = 2
4 vi. it is convenient to combine the discon-
tinuity equations to obtain the condition for the mechanical balance of the forces at the
junction

v3 cos 1 + v2 cos 2 + v1 = 0.

we can now express the remaining variables with the help of m1x and m1y using the discon-
tinuity equations as

m2x = m1x  v1,
m3x = m1x + v3 cos 1, m3y = m1y  v3 sin .

m2y = m1y,

(m1x  v1)2 + m2
(m1x + v3 cos 1)2 + (m1y  v3 sin 1)2 = 3.

constants:

5 comments on the cosmological constant problem

one of the biggest puzzles in particle physics is the vanishing of the cosmological constant
(or why its value is at least 120 orders of magnitudes smaller than its natural size of the order
m 4
p l would be). there is no symmetry that could forbid the appearance of the cosmological
constant term. thus the best hope is that there is a dynamical reason behind the vanishing
of the cosmological constant. however, within four dimensional theories it is very dicult to

11

nd a dynamical adjustment mechanism that would naturally achieve this goal (for a review
see [19]).

in the randall-sundrum scenario discussed in this paper the vanishing of the eective
four-dimensional cosmological constant is a consequence of a ne-tuning between the funda-
mental (5 dimensional) cosmological constant and the tension of the 3-brane. thus in the
original rs scenario there is no new information gained about how the cosmological constant
problem could be solved dynamically.

one can, however, imagine a more complicated scenario like one of the setups presented
in this paper, where the 3-brane we live on arises as an intersection of dierent branes.
the eective 4 dimensional cosmological constant is then a function of not only the 5 dimen-
sional cosmological constant and the brane tensions (including the tension of the intersection
brane), but also the positions (angles) of the branes. brane congurations considered in this
paper (or their most obvious generalizations) require at least one ne-tuning in addition to
the adjustment of the angles to set the eective 4 dimensional cosmological constant to zero.
one might hope however, that brane congurations exist where the eective cosmological
constant can be set to zero by adjusting only the orientations of the branes. in order for such
a brane-setup to be interesting, the values of the angles of the branes at the point where the
eective cosmological constant vanishes also have to depend on the tension of the 3-brane at
the intersection (a quantity which we did not consider in the models presented in this paper).
this is required so that it is possible to cancel the quantum corrections to the eective 4
dimensional cosmological constant due to the elds localized on the intersection by readjust-
ing the angles of the branes. if such a solution indeed existed, then one could translate the
cosmological constant problem to a completely dynamical problem in the given brane setup,
that is why the angles of the branes are adjusted such that the eective cosmological constant
vanishes. such a dynamical formulation would be by itself a useful step towards the under-
standing of the cosmological constant problem. if such a brane conguration indeed existed,
one could then furthermore speculate that the reason for the adjustment of the angles to a
setup with zero eective cosmological constant is due to the following mechanism: initially,
the positions of the branes are not adjusted and the eective 4 dimensional cosmological
constant does not vanish. therefore, the universe is inating, thereby exerting pressure on
the branes, which are slowly relaxing towards the static solution at which the eective 4
dimensional cosmological constant vanishes. of course, for this speculative picture to hold,
one would need to investigate the dynamics of the branes (beyond nding a static brane
solution with the described features). in this paper we only looked at the particular static
ansatz leading to the at four-dimensional metric. therefore, our results only indicate that
the point with the vanishing cosmological constant is the extremum of the potential for the
angles, but not necessarily the minimum.

from a four-dimensional point of view, the angles of the branes appear as scalar elds.
thus one expects that they need to be light to potentially provide a solution to the cosmolog-
ical constant problem. even then one is confronted with the usual problem of the adjustment
mechanisms for solving the cosmological constant problem. it is dicult to understand why
the potential for one or a few scalars is such that at the minimum of the potential the cosmo-
logical constant vanishes. moreover, quantum corrections seem to destroy this tuning even

12

if it was true at tree-level. however, it might be possible, that what seems to be a terrible
ne-tuning in the eective 4 dimensional theory is a simple consequence of brane dynamics
in higher dimensions, with no tuning required in the full theory of branes (after all, if a
solution of the desired type existed, the value of the cosmological constant in the bulk would
be generic). if this ne-tuning in the eective theory is indeed the consequence of brane
physics in the higher dimensional theory, one might hope that it is stable under radiative
corrections, since the quantities that presumably govern the dynamics of the branes are the
full quantum corrected ones.

in the setup considered here there is another possibility for improvement on the ne-
tuning of the potential in the eective 4 dimensional theory. as we noted, for a given set
of parameters the requirement for the existence of the static solutions with the at four-
dimensional metric completely determines the angles. thus from the four-dimensional point
of view, the potential for the angles is determined mostly by their interactions with the
metric, in particular with its light kk excitations. the description of the four-dimensional
eective theory in the rs congurations includes a large number of arbitrarily light kk
excitations. thus it is not inconceivable that their interactions with the angles lead to a
situation qualitatively dierent from the usual considerations.

6 conclusions

in this paper we have presented static solutions to einsteins equations corresponding to
branes at angles intersecting in a single 3-brane. such solutions might be useful for building
models with extra dimensions in the randall-sundrum scenario. the solutions are obtained
by gluing patches of ads space together, with the boundaries given by the branes. we nd,
that a static solution of this sort is only possible if the forces from the brane tensions acting
on the junction exactly balance.
in addition to this condition we nd other constraints
that the parameters of the theory (the brane tensions, angles of the branes and the bulk
cosmological constant) have to satisfy. in all the examples considered in this paper there is
one ne-tuning relation which is independent of the angles of the branes and thus can not
have a dynamical origin. it would be very important to understand, whether or not static
brane congurations of this sort (where all tuning conditions can be satised by adjusting
the positions of the branes) do exist, and if so whether they can be minima of the scalar
potential of the angles in the eective 4 dimensional theory.
