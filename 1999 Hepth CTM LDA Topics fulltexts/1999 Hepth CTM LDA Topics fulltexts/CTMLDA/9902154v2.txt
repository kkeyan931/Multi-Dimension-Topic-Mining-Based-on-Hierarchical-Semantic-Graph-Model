introduction

since their introduction [1], topological eld theories have been responsi-
ble for many applications [2] and are object of continuous investigations.
nowadays they represent an important chapter of quantum eld theory. the
original motivation was related to the possibility of describing topological
invariants by means of standard eld-theory techniques [1, 3].

in order to give an idea of this framework, let us briey present here the
eld-theory characterization of one of the most simple and familiar topolog-
ical invariants, namely, the linking number (1, 2) of two nonintersecting
smooth closed oriented curves in r3 [3, 4]:

figure 1:

as is well known, the linking number (1, 2) is an integer which counts
the number of times that one curve winds around the other. it is independent
from the shape of the curves and can be represented by the gauss integral

(1, 2) =

1

4i1

dxi2

dy

(x  y)
|x  y|3 .

(1)

1

expression (1) is in fact easily seen to be an integer by use of the stokes
theorem [3, 4]. taking a eld theory point of view, the linking number
(1, 2) may be obtained by introducing the topological abelian chern
simons action [1]

scs(a) =

1

2z d3xaa ,

(2)

and by evaluating the correlation function of two loop variables h dxa,

i..e.,

(cid:28)i1

dxai2

dya(cid:29)scs

.

(3)

that expression (3) reproduces the linking number follows from the obser-
vation that the propagator of the gauge eld a obtained from the chern
simons action (2) upon quantization in the landau gauge is precisely the
kernel of the gauss integral (1), i.e.,

ha(x)a(y)iscs

=

1
4



(x  y)
|x  y|3 .

(4)

the correlator (3) may thus be regarded as a eld-theory description of
the linking (1, 2). the action (2) can be suitably extended to higher
dimensions, providing a eld-theory characterization of the generalizations
of the linking number [4]. moreover, the nonabelian version of the three-
dimensional chernsimons action (2) has been proven to play a very relevant
role in knot theory [1, 3].

although the topological eld theories possess their own interests and
applications, it is worth underlining here that topological terms appear fre-
quently as parts of more general eective actions useful for the theoretical
description of a large number of phenomena in dierent space-time dimen-
sions. for instance, the eective action corresponding to the bosonization [5]
of relativistic three-dimensional massive fermionic systems at t = 0 can be
written as the sum of the chern-simons term (2) and of an innite series of
higher-order terms in the curvature f and its derivatives, i.e.,

with s(f ) being a combination of terms of the type

scs(a) + s(f ),

z d3xf 2, z d3xf 4, z d3xf 6, . . .

2

(5)

(6)

this kind of action turns out to be useful in order to study several three-
dimensional phenomena such as the fermibose transmutation [6, 7] and the
quantum hall eect [8].

a second interesting example is provided by the ve-dimensional gener-
alization of (5), obtained from the ads/cft correspondence [9, 10], which
relates the conformal n = 4 super-yang-mills theory to type-iib superstring
on ads5  s5. in fact, in the conformal case, the dual supergravity on ads5
possesses a chernsimons term obtained from a sl(2, z) doublet of two-
forms brr
 , bn s

looks like [10]

 . in this case, the relevant eective action for brr

 + s(db) ,

(7)

zads5

where the term s(db) collects all the higher-order terms in the curvatures
dbrr, dbn s. the correlation function (3) generalizes now to

(cid:28)z1

dbrr

 z2

dbn s

 (cid:29) ,

(8)

where 1, 2 are appropriate two-surfaces.

in view of these applications, it seems natural to ask ourselves what is the
response of a correlator of the type (3) when the corresponding topological
eld theory is perturbed by the introduction of a nontopological interaction
term depending on the curvature.

this is the aim of the present paper. more precisely, we shall report on

the four-loop computation of the correlator

(cid:28)i1

dxai2

dya(cid:29)se

,

(9)

when the three-dimensional chernsimons action (2) is perturbed by a non-

topological interaction term of the kind r f 4, namely, expression (9) will be

evaluated with an eective action se given by

se =

1

2z d3xa a +



4!z d3xef efef ef ,

(10)

with ef  = 1

2 f and  being an arbitrary parameter with negative mass
dimension, reecting the power-counting nonrenormalizability of the pertur-
bation.

3

in particular, we shall be able to prove that the correlation function (9)
turns out to be independent from  , yielding the linking number (1, 2) of
the two curves 1, 2. although the loop analysis will be worked out only up
to the fourth order, this conclusion holds to all orders of perturbation theory
and may be easily generalized to any local nontopological interaction term
containing arbitrary powers of the curvature f as well as to the higher-
dimensional cases [11] as, for instance, the eective action of eq.(7).

this result means that the loop correlator (9) is stable with respect to the
perturbations which can be added to the starting topological action. in other
words, the expression (9) will give the linking number of the two curves 1,
2, regardless of any f -dependent perturbation term that can be introduced
and of their power-counting nonrenormalizability character.

two remarks are now in order. first, we will limit here ourselves only
to eective actions which are abelian. second, we shall consider only f -
dependent terms which can be treated as true perturbations. therefore, we
shall avoid in the eective action (10) the inclusion of a term of the maxwell
type

(11)

smax =

1

4mz d3xf f ,

where m is a mass parameter. the presence of this term would completely
modify the original properties of the model. in fact, being expression (11)
quadratic in the gauge elds, it cannot be considered as a perturbation term,
as it will be responsible for the presence of massive excitations in the spec-
trum of the theory [12]. rather, the presence of the maxwell term in the
eective action (10) will give rise to the existence of two distinct regimes
corresponding to the long and short distance behaviours, respectively. for
distances larger than the inverse of the mass parameter m (i.e., the low-
energy regime ), the topological term will prevail, while the maxwell term
will become the relevant one at short distances (i.e., the high-energy regime).
it is worth mentioning here that these two regimes can be accessed in a very
simple way by means of suitable gauge-invariant eld redenitions of the
gauge connection a [13]. however, their full understanding is a dicult
and delicate task, which is beyond the aim of the present paper, being under
investigation.

we should also underline here that, in the abelian case, the loop vari-

able h dxa is gauge invariant for closed curves, and so there is no need
to take into account its exponentiation eih

dxa, as it would be required in

4

nential eih

the nonabelian case. this feature has a useful consequence. it allows indeed
to avoid the case in which the double-line integral (9) has to be taken along
the same curve. this case, usually referred to as the self-linking, would be
automatically generated by the perturbative taylor expansion of the expo-
dxa. in other words, as far as the abelian case is concerned, the
loop variables in eq.(9) do not need to be exponentiated. therefore, the two
curves 1 and 2 will always refer to two distinct curves which do not inter-
sect each other. as we shall see in the following, this point will be relevant in
order to establish the independence from the parameter  of the expression
(9).

2 perturbative expansion and feynman dia-

grams

in order to discuss the perturbative expansion of the loop correlator (9), let
us rst dene the gauge-xed version of the eective action which shall be
used throughout the present article, namely,

se =

1

2z d3xa a +z d3x ba +



4!z d3x : ef efef ef : ,

(12)

where the lagrange multiplier b has been introduced in order to implement
the landau gauge. notice that we have wick-ordered the quartic interaction
term, which will allow to rule out tadpole diagrams.1

as usual in this kind of problem, we shall make use of the conguration
space rather than the momentum space. let us now give the elementary
wick contractions which shall be needed for the evaluation of the feynman
diagrams. recalling that

2

1

|x  y|

= 43(x  y) ,

(13)

from eq.(4) one obtains

da(x)ef(y)e = g3(x  y) + 

1

4 |x  y|

,

(14)

1we remind the reader that, in the present abelian case, the normal-ordering pre-
scription is compatible with the requirement of gauge invariance. this follows from the
observation that the positive and negative-frequency parts f (+)
of the eld
strength f are each gauge invariant.

and f ()

and

concerning now the perturbative loop expansion, it is easily checked that
the rst feynman diagram which contributes to the correlation function (9)
is of two-loop order and can be drawn as follows:

def(x)ef(y)e = 3(x  y) .

(15)

figure 2: two-loop contribution

in the above gure, the wavy and dashed lines refer respectively to the

wick contractions daefe and def efe.

the feynman integrals corresponding to the diagram of fig.2 are easily
written down by means of eqs.(14), (15). however, before computing them,
let us spend a few words on the mechanism which is responsible for the
independence on the parameter  of expression (9). from the structure of
the diagram of fig.2, we observe that the gauge elds a(x) and a(y)

present in the interaction term of the expression (12). therefore, besides

lying on the two curves 1 and 2will be always contracted with the ef s
contractions of the type def efe, the corresponding feynman integrals will
always contain two contractions of the kind daefe. however, one should

remark in the second term of eq.(14) that one of the lorentz indices of the
two space-time derivatives corresponds to the vector index of a gauge eld

6

lying on either 1 or 2. it thus refers to a total derivative with respect
to the variable running along one of the closed loops, implying a vanishing
contribution. in other words, the second term of eq.(14) may be neglected.
as a consequence, all the wick contractions entering the feynman integrals
will basically lead to a product of delta functions. after the introduction of
a suitable regularization, the latter can be integrated out, nally resulting
in a 3(x  y), where, we remind, x and y run along each of the two curves,
respectively. as these variables never coincide, the whole expression vanishes
identically, ensuring the independence from the parameter  of the correlator
(9). the same mechanism can be seen to occur at higher loop orders, as it
will be explicitly shown later on.

apart from an irrelevant global symmetry coecient, the diagram of fig.2

therefore corresponds to the following integral:

i (2) = i1

dxi2

dyz d3z1 d3z2 da(x) f(z1)eda(y) f(z2)ed f(z1) f(z2)e
h4d f (z1) f (z2)ed f (z1) f (z2)e + 2d f (z1) f (z2)ed f (z1) f (z2)ei .

(16)

let us analyse the rst term of the above expression. making use of the
propagators (14) and (15), we obtain

dxi2

dyz d3z1 d3z2
4i1
(cid:20)g3(x  z1) + 
4 |x  z1|(cid:21)(cid:20)g3(y  z2) + 
(cid:2)3(z1  z2)(cid:3)(cid:2)  3(z1  z2)(cid:3)(cid:2)3(z1  z2)(cid:3) .

1

1

4 |y  z2|(cid:21)

(17)

as previously mentioned, the terms containing the derivatives  and 
do not contribute, as they correspond to total derivatives on closed curves.
expression (17) then becomes

dxi2
4i1
(cid:2)3(z1  z2)(cid:3)(cid:2)

dyz d3z1 d3z2 3(x  z1)3(y  z2)
  3(z1  z2)(cid:3)(cid:2)

3(z1  z2)(cid:3) .(18)

in spite of the presence of products of delta functions with the same argu-
ments, the above expression is easily seen to vanish. let us show this claim

7

in two ways. first, we observe that there is always a possible order of taking
the integrations over the delta functions such that we end up with products
of 3(x  y) and not of 3(0).
in the present case, this would amount to
integrate out rst the two delta functions with arguments x  z1 and y  z2,
which would lead to

4i1

dxi2

dy(cid:2)3(x  y)(cid:3)(cid:2)

  3(x  y)(cid:3)(cid:2)

3(x  y)(cid:3) = 0 ,

(19)
since x  y never vanishes. it is worth remarking that this possibility exists,
in fact, for the higher-order diagrams, as will be shown below.

second, we can adopt a more rigorous treatment by regularizing the delta
functions with coinciding arguments through the point-splitting procedure
already used by polyakov [6]:

(z1  z2) =

1

(2)3/2

e(z1z2)2/2 ,

(z1  z2) = 3(z1  z2) .

lim
0

(20)

more precisely, whenever a product of n delta functions with coinciding ar-
guments occurs, it will be understood as

where the limit   0 is meant to be taken at the end of all calculations.
accordingly, expression (18) will be replaced by its regularized version,

(cid:2)3(z1  z2)(cid:3)n = [(z1  z2)]n1 3(z1  z2) ,
dxi2

dy 3(x  z1)3(y  z2)

lim
0

4i1
(cid:2)(z1  z2)(cid:3) [

  (z1  z2)](cid:2)

3(z1  z2)(cid:3) . (21)

whatever the order of integration, we get, before taking the limit, an expres-
sion containing 3(x  y), which leads to a null result.

the second term of (16) follows analogously, so that the two-loop diagram

of fig.2 does not contribute to the correlator (9).

concerning the higher-order contributions in the perturbation theory, the
results are of a similar nature. the topologically distinct diagrams contribut-
ing to the 3- and 4-loop are given in fig.3 and in figs.4 and 5.

8

figure 3: three-loop contribution

figure 4: four-loop contribution, rst type

9

figure 5: four-loop contribution, second type

it is sucient to present here just one typical term of each order. a
notational simplication is convenient. we dene the transverse derivative
operator

  .

for instance, a typical contraction from fig.3 is proportional to

i (3) = i1

= i1

dyz d3z1 d3z2d3z3 g3(x  z1)g3(y  z2)

dxi2
h 3(z1  z2)ih 3(z1  z3)ih 3(z1  z3)i
h 3(z2  z3)ih 3(z2  z3)i
dyz d3z3h  3(x  y)i
dxi2
h (x  z3)ih 3(x  z3)ih (y  z3)ih 3(y  z3)i ,

(22)

while the diagram of fig.4 gives

i (4) = i1

dxi2

dyz d3z1    d3z4 g3(x  z1)g3(y  z2)

10

h  3(z1  z2)ih 3(z1  z3)ih 3(z1  z4)i
h 3(z2  z4)ih 3(z2  z3)ih 3(z3  z4)i
h 3(z3  z4)i
dxi2
h 3(x  z3)ih 3(x  z4)ih 3(y  z4)i
h 3(y  z3)ih (z3  z4)ih 3(z3  z4)i .

dyz d3z3 d3z4 h  3(x  y)i

= i1

(23)

in order to obtain the above expressions we have followed the same prescrip-
tion established before for regularizing the delta functions with identical ar-
guments. notice also that we have integrated out rst the two -functions
whose arguments depend on the points x and y of the two curves.

all terms in all possible diagrams may then be seen to be proportional to
3(xy) (or its derivatives). one may easily convince oneself that this mech-
anism also applies to any order in perturbation theory. as we always have
x 6= y, these diagrams all amount to a null correction to the basic diagram,
so that the correlation function (9) for two closed smooth nonintersecting
curves 1, 2 gives their linking number to all orders:

ha(x)a(y)ise

= (1, 2).

(24)

3 conclusions

we have been able to show, in the present article, that the correlation func-
tion (9) is unaected by the radiative corrections, provided 1, 2 are two
nonintersecting closed curves. although we have given explicit expressions

for the r f 4 perturbation, the same result may be achieved for any local
interaction term of the type r f n.

we may interpret this result as a kind of nonrenormalization property of
the linking number, reecting its stability with respect to any local gauge
invariant perturbation of the starting chern-simons action.

further generalizations to higher dimensions as well as to the nonabelian

case are under investigation [11].
