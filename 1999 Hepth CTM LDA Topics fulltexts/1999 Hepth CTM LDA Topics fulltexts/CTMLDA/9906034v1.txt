introduction and summary

in this thesis we perform an analytic study of the gauged nambujona-lasinio
(gnjl) model. the gnjl model is a toy-model of dynamical chiral symmetry
breaking (dsb). the famous nambujona-lasinio (njl) model [1] is one of the
rst models exhibiting dsb in relativistic quantum eld theory and was inspired
by models of superconductivity.

dsb is based on the phenomenon that strongly attractive interactions between
massless fermions give rise to the formation of fermionanti-fermion bound states
and generation of a fermion mass. in this way dynamical symmetry breaking is a
special case of spontaneous symmetry breaking where a symmetry of a particular
model is broken by the appearance of a vacuum expectation value (vev) of a
composite operator (e.g. h i) instead of the vev of a fundamental eld (e.g.
the vev of the higgs eld in the standard model).
if the broken symmetry is
continuous, such as the chiral symmetry, dynamical symmetry breaking gives rise
to the goldstone mechanism, e.g. see refs. [2, 3].

probably the most well-known realization of dsb and the goldstone mech-
anism is provided by the low-energy dynamics of hadrons. even long before the
formulation of qcd (the microscopic theory of the strong interactions) the njl
model formed a basis for the phenomenological description of the chiral dynamics
of hadrons.

chiral symmetry is a symmetry of models with massless fermions.

in such
models left-handed spinors and right-handed spinors1 do not interact and con-
sequently their corresponding quantum numbers are conserved. to be more precise,
chiral symmetry is the invariance of a model under independent unitary transfor-
mations of left-handed and right-handed spinors, for example ul  ur.
whenever a mass term is added to the lagrangian of the model an interaction
between left-handed and right-handed spinors is introduced, giving fermions a mass,
and the chiral symmetry is lost. this is called explicit chiral symmetry breaking.
however, in the case of strong interactions between the fermions it is possible that
a mass is generated dynamically and a chiral condensate, h i, is formed.

respectively right-handedness,

fermions.

introduction and summary

the chiral condensate is the order parameter of chiral symmetry breaking
and plays a quite similar role as the total magnetization in models of magnets in
statistical mechanics. in this context, the presence of an explicit mass parameter is
analogous to the presence of an external magnetic eld in e.g. certain ising models.
due to the existence of chiral (axial) wardtakahashi identities the generation of
a fermion mass (i.e. the appearance of a gap in the fermion spectrum) coincides with
the appearance of spinless bound states. this, then, is the dynamical realization of
the goldstone mechanism.

suppose that the space of fermion mass operators is spanned by the orthogo-
nal operators  and i5. then we choose the chiral symmetry breaking (the
long range ordering) to be in the direction of . the massless bound states or
nambugoldstone (ng) bosons are given by correlations transverse to the di-
rection of ordering. these states are called the pseudoscalar composites or the 
bosons. the massive spinless scalar bound states (i.e. the higgs bosons) describe
correlations longitudinal to the direction of ordering and are referred to as the
scalar composites or the  bosons.

moreover, in analogy with statistical mechanics, the generated mass m of the
 should be considered as the inverse of the correlation length, i.e. m  1/. the
correlation length describes the spatial extent of uctuations of a physical quantity
(e.g. see refs. [4, 5, 6]). in quantum eld theories (qfts) the correlation length
describes the range of forces (interactions). of course a well-known example is given
by qed. the coulomb interaction has innite range, which is reected by the
fact that the photon, the carrier of the electromagnetic interaction, is massless. the
range of the electroweak force is given in terms the masses of the w and z gauge
bosons,   1/mw , respectively   1/mz.
the equation for the fermion mass is called the gap equation and describes
the self-interaction (self-energy) of the fermion elds. the gap equation is a non-
linear eigenvalue equation. for values of the coupling constants above some critical
coupling the gap equation has a nonzero solution for the fermion mass even in
the absence of an explicit external mass. this solution leads to a nonvanishing
chiral condensate and consequently the chiral symmetry is broken. for values of
the coupling below the critical value the gap equation only has the trivial solution
with zero fermion mass and the chiral symmetry is unbroken. exactly at the critical
coupling the fermion mass is zero and the condensate vanishes; the gap equation
describes a continuous phase transition. this is reected by the non-analyticity
of the gap equation in the coupling constant which causes the change of phase.
the chiral condensate continuously changes from zero in the symmetric phase to
nonzero values in the broken phase. as was pointed out by yang and lee [7] this
non-analyticity is characteristic for phase transitions and can only occur in systems
describing an innite number of degrees of freedom.2

the realization of dsb is inherently nonperturbative and typically requires

2relativistic quantum eld theories are systems with an innite number of degrees of freedom.

3

that coupling constants describing the fundamental interactions between fermions
are of order one.

in the njl model dynamical chiral symmetry breaking was realized by strong
attractive four-fermion interactions (think of ( )2) which were incorporated in
a mean-eld approach known as the hartreefock approximation. in mean-eld
approximations the composite operators such as  are replaced by their vevs
(   h i) and uctuations about that value are ignored. however the njl
model turned out to be in the language of the sixties a nonrenormalizable model.
it has a limited range of applicability because of the explicit dependence on the
ultra-violet cuto .3

it was realized by the kiev group in refs. [8, 9] that qed in the quenched-
ladder approximation also exhibits dynamical chiral symmetry breaking for values
of the bare gauge coupling 0 > c  1, where 0 = e2
0/4. this was argued to be
intimately connected with the fall into the center phenomenon. by considering
the dirac equation describing a light fermion in a static coulomb potential, it
was shown that, when the coulomb attraction dominates the centrifugal barrier
for 0  c, the system collapses (i.e. a drastic rearrangement of the ground
state (vacuum) occurs). later it was pointed out in refs. [10, 11] that the critical
coupling c above which the chiral symmetry is broken should be considered as an
ultra-violet (uv) xed point.

an important step was performed by bardeen, leung, and love in refs. [12, 13].
these authors realized that, in quenched-ladder qed, four-fermion interactions
have a so-called scaling dimension 4 instead of 6 at the critical gauge coupling
0 = c. consequently these operators mix with the gauge interaction which also
has dimension 4 in four space-time dimensions; this means that qed is not a
closed theory at the chiral phase transition. the scaling dimension of an operator
is important since it determines the possible range of the interaction which the
operator describes. their model is referred to as the gauged nambujona-lasinio
(gnjl) model.

the origin and physical signicance of scaling dimensions is undoubtedly best
explained by the renormalization-group methods of wilson [14, 15]. wilson stressed
the importance of dening a low-energy eective action or microscopic action from
which a generating functional can be constructed. the wilsonian eective action is
an action describing local interactions dened at some microscopic length scale a 
1/. the interactions between the degrees of freedom corresponding to distances
shorter than 1/ are not dened and such dynamics are eectively described
by the coupling constants of the microscopic action. in this way the high energy
frequencies of the elds with e   are coarse grained or integrated out into
the coupling constants and the coupling constants implicitly depend on the cuto
.

the interesting question is what type of macroscopic physics characterized by

3the cuto is required to render the theory nite.

4

introduction and summary

an infra-red (ir) energy scale e with e   can be realized from the microscopic
action. the transformation of the microscopic action to the macroscopic action is
governed by the renormalization-group (rg) transformation of the coupling con-
stants of the model.
if a macroscopic model can be derived from a microscopic
model in such a way that the macroscopic dynamics can be formulated indepen-
dently of the scale  and only depend on the coupling constants of the microscopic
model, the microscopic model is said to be renormalizable.

wilson pointed out that such a macroscopic theory can only be formulated if
the rg transformation exhibits uv xed points. uv xed points are singular
points4 of the rg transformation at which the model becomes scale (i.e. conformal)
invariant. wilson pointed out that natural candidates for uv xed points are
critical points governing a continuous phase transition. since, at a continuous phase
transition, the correlation length  is innite, the model is scale invariant and the
dynamics is extremely sensitive to external perturbations.

a mathematical formulation of the rg transformation and uv xed points
for qed was already given by gell-mann and low in ref. [16]. but the physical
signicance of such xed points and the interpretation of innities appearing in
feynman diagrams were not fully understood in the fties and sixties.

the most crucial observation of wilson is that in the rg transformation, i.e.
the coarse graining process, new types of local interactions are generated and that
the new interactions can be classied as either irrelevant or relevant interactions. in
this way the rg transformation is a nontrivial improvement of the coarse graining
methods of kadano [17]. by denition, the eect of an irrelevant interaction5 of
a microscopic action is suppressed by positive powers of e/ in the macroscopic
action. this is closely related to the appelquistcarazzone decoupling theorem
[18]. hence only relevant interactions are important in determining what kind of
macroscopic dynamics emerges from microscopic models. the eect of irrelevant
interactions can always be absorbed by adapting the coupling constants of relevant
and marginal interactions. marginal interactions are in between irrelevant and rele-
vant and are considered the most interesting ones; in four dimensions they comprise
the gauge interactions.

in analogy with statistical mechanics, the continuous chiral phase transition can
be classied in terms of critical exponents which describe the scaling of various
macroscopic quantities (e.g. the chiral condensate, correlation length, eective po-
tential, chiral susceptibility) close to or at the critical point. it is considered a strong
indication of the existence of a nontrivial continuum limit (  ), if so-called hy-
perscaling relations between these various critical exponents are satised. the rg
of wilson provides the framework for explanation and computation of the critical
exponents and makes an intimate connection between critical phenomena (in partic-
ular continuous phase transitions) in statistical mechanics and the renormalization

5 irrelevant interactions are also referred to as nonrenormalizable.

5

and existence of the continuum limit in quantum eld theories.

especially, close to a phase transition, the rg methods of wilson show that
it is not possible, a priori (without solving the equations of motion), to determine
which interactions are relevant or irrelevant; particular interactions can acquire
anomalous dimensions and interactions which are irrelevant in a certain region of
coupling constant space might become relevant in another region.

the coupling constants which govern the chiral phase transition are similar to

the inverse of the temperature in models of statistical mechanics.

perturbatively the four-fermion interaction is irrelevant, which is supposedly due
to the fact that the four-fermion coupling constant has negative dimension (in mass
units). however, as was shown by bardeen, love, and leung [12, 13] the solutions
to the gap equation in the gnjl model suggest that the four-fermion interactions
acquire a large anomalous dimension. the anomalous dimension m of the mass
operator  equals one (m = 1) at 0 = c.

the gnjl model literally is the gauged version of the njl model. it is based on
induced chiral invariant and gauge invariant four-fermion interactions. the gauge
group can be either a u (1) gauge symmetry or some non-abelian gauge symmetry.
in case of gnjl model there are two attractive interactions: an attractive four-
fermion interaction and a gauge interaction (with gauge coupling 0). in this thesis
we will consider the gnjl model with u (1) gauge symmetry, in that case the gnjl
model is a generalization of of quantum electrodynamics (qed). the microscopic
lagrangian for a single fermion avor reads

l =

 + (id  m0) +
f 2

g0

2 (cid:2)( )2 + ( i5)2(cid:3) ,

(1)

where d =   ie0a, and where g0 is the positive four-fermion coupling. the
lagrangian is determined by the following three dimensionless coupling constants:

0 = m0/,

0 = e2

0/4,

g0 = g02/42,

(2)

where  is the ultraviolet cuto. the gnjl model can be conveniently analyzed
in terms of so called auxiliary elds ( = g0  and  = g0 i5) describing
scalar and pseudoscalar degrees of freedom. in such a formulation, the four-fermion
interactions are described by the interactions of the auxiliary elds with the fermion
elds. then the connected two-point green function of the  eld describes the
ng-boson and the connected two-point green function of the  eld describes the
higgs boson.

in the quenched-ladder (quenched-planar) approximation the chiral phase struc-
ture was computed in refs. [19, 20]. there is a critical curve in the coupling constant
plane (0, g0) which separates a chiral symmetric phase from a phase in which the
chiral symmetry is dynamically broken.

in ref. [21] the anomalous dimension m along the critical curve was computed
(in the broken phase) and it was found that 1  m  2, where m = 1 at 0 = c
and m = 2 at 0 = 0.

introduction and summary

the particle spectrum consists of pseudoscalar () and scalar () bound states
which become relevant degrees of freedom (their masses are light) in the vicinity
of the critical curve.
in the dsb phase there is a massless pseudoscalar (ng-
boson) and a massive scalar. since the phase transition is second order along the
critical curve there are scalar and pseudoscalar resonances on the symmetric side
of the curve whose masses also vanish as the critical curve is approached [22]. the
phase transition at njl point (0 = 0) is believed to be of the mean eld type (up
to logarithmic corrections) and to correspond to that of a trivial theory, e.g. see
ref. [3].

in the intermediate region (0 < 0 < c), the phase transition is quite similar
to the pure njl case except that the critical exponents satisfy nonmean-eld hy-
perscaling relations which supports the view that the quenched approximation has
a nontrivial continuum limit [23, 24].

at, what is referred to as the qed point, 0 = c, the phase transition is
rather special and is characterized by a scaling law with an essential singularity
(instead of a power law) for the fermion dynamical mass. there is an abrupt
change in the particle spectrum when the phase boundary is crossed. this peculiar
phase transition has properties similar to the berezinsky-kosterlitz-thouless phase
transition [25, 26] and is referred to as the conformal phase transition (cpt) [27].
the crucial point is that the symmetry is broken by marginal operators instead of
by relevant operators.

whereas from the perturbative point of view the correlation length of a four-
fermion interaction is typically the inverse of the cuto   1/, close to a critical
point in the gnjl model we nd that

  1/m,

m = (g0) ,

(3)

where g0 = |g0  gc| measures the distance of g0 to critical point gc and  is
a (positive) critical exponent. thus, when g0  0, the correlation length goes
to innity. this is interpreted as a dimensional transmutation of the four-fermion
operator ( )2 which has a canonical dimension of 6 to a nonperturbatively induced
dynamical dimension ddyn  4 (hence relevant (marginal)) at the critical point:

dim( )2 = 6  2m  4,

dim( ) = 3  m.

(4)

the factorization property dim( )2 = 2dim( ) is implicit in the quenched-
ladder approximation and is crucial for the nonperturbative renormalizability of the
gnjl model [23]; it leads to the requirement that the critical exponent  of the
so-called chiral susceptibility equals one,  = 1.

the interest in the gnjl has been stimulated by its importance for constructing
new scenarios of dynamical realization of electroweak symmetry breaking. exam-
ples are strong extended technicolor models (e.g. see refs. [28, 29, 30, 21]) and
the top-quark condensate model (e.g.
it was argued in
refs. [34, 35, 36, 37] that large anomalous dimensions could solve the problem of

see refs. [31, 32, 33]).

for a general introduction into these models and their predecessors we refer to the
book by miransky [3].

since these models are based on strong interactions, giving rise to the appear-
ance of a large anomalous dimension for the mass operator , these models are
inherently nonperturbative. the origin of the four-fermion interactions is assumed
to be given by physics at or above some high energy scale . two natural candi-
dates for the high energy scale or ultra-violet cuto  are the scale of grand unied
theories (guts), i.e.   1015  1016 gev, and the planck scale   1019 gev.
the relevant physics at these scales should somehow be given by guts, sypersym-
metric eld theories, supergravity, string theory, or perhaps m -theory. however,
the main point is that as long as the model is close to criticality the low-energy
eective dynamics is rather insensitive to the details of the interactions at . this
is known as universality. for instance the exchange of a heavy gauge boson with a
mass of the order of the cuto  could induce such a local four-fermion interacting
for energies e  .

the gnjl model in the quenched approximation has been studied extensively
on the lattice (in so-called noncompact formulation, e.g. see ref. [38]), by means
of nonperturbative renormalization group (nprg) methods, and with schwinger
dyson (sd) techniques. in the quenched approximation fermion-loops are omitted,
and consequently the gauge coupling 0 does not run. in addition to the quenched
approximation, the sdes are studied by taking the gauge interaction in the ladder or
planar approximation; this means that crossed photon graphs and vertex corrections
are omitted.

a very useful and popular method is the computation of the low-energy eective
action for the composite elds which is obtained after integrating out the fermion
and photon elds in the generating functional. such methods are capable of com-
puting macroscopic quantities such as the eective yukawa coupling, y , the mass
of the  boson, m, and the pion decay constant, f.

the comparison of the lattice simulations and nprg methods show that qualita-
tively the ladder approximation is reliable, and rather small quantitative dierences
arise because of the neglect of vertex corrections and crossed photon exchange dia-
grams. the advantage however of the quenched-ladder sd formalism with respect
to the numerical methods is that results can be obtained analytically.

the rst three chapters of this thesis cover most of the important achievements
and results on dynamical chiral symmetry breaking in the gnjl model and qed,
which we feel are necessary to understand the results of chapters 4 and 5.

in chapter 1 we review the path-integral formalism for the generating functional
and the schwingerdyson equation (sde). we briey discuss the basic features
governing phase transitions and critical phenomena in statistical mechanics and
discuss the rg of wilson, the goldstone mechanism, and the auxiliary eld method
for the gnjl model. in chapter 2 we derive both the schwingerdyson equations

and the so-called partial conserved axial currents (pcac). chapter 3 is devoted to
the gap equation, scaling laws, the critical curve etcetera. moreover in chapter 3 we
compare the sd quenched-ladder approach with other nonperturbative techniques.
the results and conclusions of this thesis are the following.

in chapter 4: in quenched-ladder approximation, treating the four-fermion inter-
action in the mean-eld setting, we have computed analytically the scalar yukawa
vertex in specic kinematical regimes. the yukawa vertex describes the interaction
between fermions and the composite states, i.e. the spinless  and  bosons. by
making use of chebyshev expansions we are able to derive asymptotic expressions
for the yukawa vertex as functions of the in-going momentum of the fermions and
out-going momentum of the  boson. this allows us to derive an analytic expression
for the scalar propagator (the  boson propagator), which is valid along the entire
critical curve.

our results are in agreement with previous work of appelquist et al. [22], and re-
lated work [39], who used a resummation technique which applies only for relatively
small values of 0. near the critical gauge coupling 0 = c the light resonances
in the symmetric phase disappear from the particle spectrum, and the scaling law
with an essential singularity, which is characteristic for the cpt of miransky and
yamawaki ([27]), is recovered by analytic continuation of the  boson propagator
across the critical curve. the results of chapter 4 were published in ref. [40].

in chapter 5 we study the unquenched gnjl model6 and reinvestigate the
screening of the gauge coupling 0 by computing the vacuum polarization. we
consider the gnjl model with global ul(n )  ur(n ) chiral symmetry, where n
is the number of fermion avors.7 the interesting question is whether the gnjl
model exhibits ultra-violet xed points or the gauge coupling 0,

(0) = 0,


(0) < 0,

the function  describes the renormalization group ow of 0. if such an uv xed
point exists the model has a nontrivial (interacting) continuum limit.

many works on qed conclude, following landau and pomeranchuk [42], that
qed is trivial (non-interacting) in four dimensions; the continuum limit describes
a free-eld theory (there is no root of the  function satisfying eq. (5)). this is a
result of the total screening of the gauge coupling by virtual fermion pairs (fermion
loops) from the vacuum. however we think that the main ingredient for settling
the charge screening problem is missing, namely the contribution of the composite
 and  bosons and their eective interactions with fermions.

the observation that hyperscaling relations are satised ([23, 24]) clearly indi-
cates that the correlations corresponding to the four-fermion interactions are not of

6that means we turn back on fermion loops.

variant four-fermion operators (e.g. see ref. [41]).

the mean-eld type. according to landaus mean-eld theory only specic mean-
eld exponents can describe the scaling near the critical point. therefore any de-
viation from the mean-eld exponents signals the inconsistency of the mean-eld
approach and suggests that uctuations of the composite  and  elds about their
mean value cannot be ignored.

we argue that in case of the gnjl model close to the chiral phase transition
the virtual fermion loops causing charge screening are suppressed due to the ap-
pearance of attractive relevant four-fermion interactions, where we recall that the
four-fermion interactions are represented by the exchange of  and  bosons. the
standard picture of the qed-vacuum as a medium of virtual electric dipoles formed
by virtual fermionanti-fermion pairs breaks down due to the strong self-interactions
of the fermions. moreover the problem is avor dependent; the larger the number of
fermion avors, the more the charge is screened. on the other hand with n fermion
avors there are 2n 2 chiral invariant four-fermion interactions. thus increase of n
increases the role of four-fermion interactions. the four-fermion interactions induce
a nontrivial yukawa interaction, this is also referred to as the nondecoupling of the
composites, see ref. [43]. the spinless composites states are relevant degrees of
freedom for a large range of momenta m  p  .
we incorporate the  and  exchanges using the skeleton expansion [44] for
the irreducible bethesalpeter kernel and the 1/n expansion of t hooft [45]. the
skeleton expansion is formulated in terms of fully dressed vertices and propagators
for which we substitute the asymptotic expressions for the scalar yukawa vertex and
 boson propagator derived in chapter 4. the basic idea of the 1/n expansion is
that for n large only the planar (i.e.
ladder) exchanges of  and  bosons are
dominant. then by making use of a resummation technique of johnson et al. [46]
we can compute the  function of the gauge coupling 0 dened by eq. (5) and
search for ultra-violet xed points. we nd that uv xed points exist for values of
n above a critical value nc  54. the largest uv xed point is 0  0.14.
assuming that our results are qualitatively correct, we have realized, in an
inherently nonperturbative manner8, a nontrivial (i.e. interacting) continuum limit
for a nonasymptotically free gauge eld theory in four dimensions. this means
that the low-energy dynamics characterized by an energy scale e (e  ) can be
formulated independent of the ultra-violet cuto  by tuning the bare couplings to
their critical values. thus the trade-o is that bare couplings have to be ne-tuned
to their critical values (the uv xed points).

this ne-tuning, which is also known in the literature as the gauge hierarchy
problem (m  ), is not (yet) explained by the model itself. studies of dynamical
symmetry breaking in supersymmetric models provide a promising solution, e.g.
see ref. [47]. the crucial question is; why is the system close to criticality? an
interesting resolution is that of self-organizing criticality, see ref. [48].

the realization of such a nontrivial theory requires a large number of fermion

8perturbatively the gnjl model is a trivial theory.

introduction and summary

avors n > nc  54 and the ne-tuning of the four-fermion coupling g0 and gauge
coupling 0 to their uv xed points. clearly our claims should be veried in the
future by quantitatively more reliable techniques such as lattice simulations and
nonperturbative renormalization group methods. especially we believe that the de-
termination of the critical value nc is rather sensitive to the various approximations
used, hence nc is a so-called nonuniversal quantity.

phase transitions and
quantum eld theory

this chapter provides the basic framework of this thesis. after introducing the
path-integral formalism for relativistic quantum eld theory, we discuss the feature
of critical phenomena (such as continuous phase transitions) and scaling in sta-
tistical mechanics. we review the renormalization group methods of wilson and
the goldstone mechanism. this chapter is concluded with the introduction of the
gnjl model and the auxiliary eld method.

1.1 review of the path-integral formalism

relativistic quantum eld theory (qft) is governed by expectation values of opera-
tor-valued elds on minkowski space-time. the eld at each space-time point is
referred to as a degree of freedom, thus any particular nite region of space-time
deals with an innite number of degrees of freedom. the vacuum expectation
values are particular expectation values of the elds. these so-called green func-
tions (or correlation functions) describe the behavior of elementary particles. the
interactions are given by an action s, and the dynamics is derived from a generat-
ing functional z. from this generating functional the entire (innite) set of green
functions can be constructed. the generating functional is analogous to the parti-
tion function or gibbs integral in statistical mechanics. the generating functional
is given as a functional path-integral over all eld congurations weighted by the
classical action times i/h, henceforth we will use units in which h = 1. this
so-called path-integral formalism was introduced by feynman [49, 50] for quantum
mechanics and quantum eld theory.

in what follows only one scalar eld is considered for simplicity. the generating
functional z as the function of some arbitrary external source j(x) can be written

11

12

as

phase transitions and quantum eld theory

z[k, j] = nz d exp{is[k, , j]},

(1.1)

where n is some normalization constant such that z[k, j = 0] = 1, and where the
action (or weight) s[k, , j] is the sum of some particular fundamental action sf ,
and the source action sj describing the coupling to the arbitrary source j:

s[k, , j] = sf [k, ] + sj [j, ].

the source action, sj , is of the form

sj [j, ] z ddx j(x)(x),

in d dimensions. we consider actions of local operators oi of :

sf [k, ] =z ddx xi

kioi [(x)] ,

where an example of a local (euclidean) operator o is

o [(x)] = (x)(x),

(1.2)

(1.3)

(1.4)

(1.5)

with  the laplacian. the generating functional z is a functional of the external
sources j(x) and couplings k; z is by construction analytic in the sources j, see
refs. [51, 6], and eq. (1.7). green functions are dened as time-ordered vacuum
expectation values (vev) of a specic number of elds, e.g.,

ig(n)(x1, x2, , xn)  h0|t ((x1)(x2) (xn))|0i



=

ij(xn) 





ij(x2)

ij(x1)

,

(1.6)

z[k, j](cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)j=0

i.e. the generating functional generates vevs of time-ordered products of elds.
hence the green functions can be constructed by functionally dierentiating z
with respect to sources. since the generating functional is analytic in j(x), the
generating functional can be expressed as a taylor series in sources,

z[k, j] =



xn=0

in

n!z ddx1  ddxn ig(n)(x1, , xn)j(x1) j(xn),

(1.7)

where the green function depend implicitly on the couplings k. however, although
the above construction of functional integration might appear to be rather straight-
forward and intuitive, this is deceptive.
it is a highly nontrivial mathematical

1.1 review of the path-integral formalism

problem how to dene the functional integration measure, d, and functional inte-
gration properly. in ref. [52] the problem of functional integration is addressed, and
a new perspective on functional integration is presented. the idea of de mirleau is
to dene such functional integration just as one would dene integration, i.e., as a
solution of a dierential equation, with appropriate boundary conditions.
for a xed euclidean action s, consider the following linear functional

hfi  nz d f exp{s []},

(1.8)

where f and s belong to the same algebra, and n is a number. the functional
integration is dened by the following properties:

1. the schwingerdyson equation (sde): h(s)fi  hfi = 0,
2. positivity: f  0 = hfi  0,
3. normalization: h1i = nr d exp{s []},
where the  represent derivatives (mutually commuting (bosons) or anti-commuting
(fermions)) of the particular functional space or algebra, (e.g.   /(x)). the
normalization condition 3 is straightforward for nite dimensional integration, but
is not always applicable to the innite dimensional case. we refer to [52] for an
extensive discussion of this point. the schwingerdyson equation (sde) was inde-
pendently formulated by dyson [53] and schwinger [54].

let us consider the euclidean version of generating functional z of eq. (1.1)

which is dened as

z[k, j]  hexp{z ddx j(x)(x)}isf ,
hf []isf  nz d f [] exp{sf [k, , j]}.

then, the sde for z can be written as

(1.9)

(1.10)

(1.11)

(cid:26) sf [k, ]

(x)

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(x)=/j(x)

+ j(x)(cid:27)z [k, j] = 0.

such an equation was in fact formulated already by feynman in ref. [49]. the sde
for any green function corresponding to this particular model (1.9) can be obtained
by rst dierentiating eq. (1.11) with respect to appropriate combinations of sources
(j(x), j(y), . . .) and then putting all sources equal to zero.

from the generating functional one can construct the following functional (in

euclidean formulation):

w [k, j]  log z[k, j]



=

xn=1

1

n!z ddx1  ddxn g(n)

c (x1, , xn)j(x1) j(xn), (1.12)

14

phase transitions and quantum eld theory

which is the generating functional for connected green functions, g(n)
c , i.e. green
functions which satisfy the cluster property, see ref. [6]1. the functional w is
now convex in the couplings k, and analytic in the sources j; w is extensive, i.e.
proportional to the total volume, and is analogous to the free energy in statistical
mechanics.

the green functions given by eq. (1.7) and the connected green functions of
eq. (1.12) are not dened on the entire space-time manifold, because of the existence
of so called short distance singularities, e.g. the limit
ig(n)(x1, x2, x3, , xn)

lim
x1x2

(1.13)

is ill dened. regularization (e.g. paulivillars), which we will discuss in sec-
tion 1.3, permits a setting for the treatment of eq. (1.13).

1.2 continuous phase transitions

phase transitions can occur in systems containing an innite number of degrees of
freedom exhibiting nonanalytic behavior (e.g. in certain vevs) in one (or more) of
its parameters such as the temperature. a model in statistical mechanics, e.g. the
ising model, is given in terms of a partition function

z [k]  tr exp{h},

(1.14)

where   1/kbt (kb is boltzmans constant). the partition function is dened
over a nite region  with a volume v ()  ld, surface s()  ld1, and with
n () degrees of freedom, where l is characteristic length scale, and d the dimension
of the system. the hamiltonian for the system is written as

h =

n

xi

kioi [s] ,

(1.15)

where k = (k1, k2, . . . , kn)  (t, h, . . .) (with t the temperature, h the external
magnetic eld etc.) are coupling constants and the (local) operators o are func-
tionals of the dynamical degrees of freedom, which in case of the ising model are
spins sj (1  j  n ()  (l/a)d) on lattice sites with a lattice spacing a. the lat-
tice spacing a is then referred to as the microscopic length scale, since interactions
on a scale smaller than a are not dened. the trace, tr, in eq. (1.14) represents
the sum over all possible congurations of spins, and is analogous to the functional
integration in eq. (1.1).

the free energy is dened by

(1.16)
1in short, the cluster property states that the vacuum expectation value of a product of local

f [k] = kbt log z [k] .

operators factorizes when their space-like separations become large [2].

1.2 continuous phase transitions

15

assuming that the thermodynamic limit,

v (), s(), n ()  ,

n ()/v () = constant,

(1.17)

for the free energy exists, we can dene the bulk free energy density fb (the free
energy per lattice site):

fb[k] = lim

n ()

f [k]
n ()

.

(1.18)

the so-called extensive thermodynamic behavior is now described by fb[k], and its
derivatives with respect to coupling parameters such as the temperature t or ex-
ternal magnetic eld h. an example of a macroscopic quantity is the magnetization
m ,

m 

fb[k]

h  hsi.

(1.19)

the bulk free energy fb is a convex function of the coupling parameters.

a phase of a system is dened by regions of analyticity of fb[k]. possible non-
analyticities of fb[k] occur at points, lines or hyperplanes in parameter space. we
dene ds as the dimension of a particular non-analyticity region of fb[k]. suppose
that fb[k] is given in terms of d coupling constants. if the dimension d of the
space of coupling constants, and the dimension ds of the non-analyticity is such
that the co-dimension

c = d  ds = 1,

(1.20)

then this non-analyticity is referred to as a phase-boundary. thus, a phase bound-
ary is dened by non-analyticities of fb[k] which separate phases. whenever, by
changing the coupling constants k, the phase boundary is crossed, the model is
said to undergo a phase transition.

the bulk free energy fb[k], because it is convex, is continuous everywhere. phase
transitions are classied into rst order, respectively, continuous phase transitions
depending on whether the rst derivatives of fb with respect to k are continuous
or not.

1. we speak of a rst order phase transition, if one (or more) of the rst deriva-
tives fb/ki of the bulk free energy is discontinuous at the phase boundary
(critical point). it means that an order parameter changes discontinuously
across the phase boundary.

2. we speak of a continuous phase transition, if all rst derivatives of the bulk
free energy are continuous at the phase boundary, meaning that an order pa-
rameter changes continuously across the phase boundary. the non-analyticity
of the phase boundary is reected by discontinuities of certain higher order
(than one) derivatives of the order parameter at the phase boundary.

16

phase transitions and quantum eld theory

in case of the ising model the order parameter is the magnetization m , which
in absence of an external magnetic eld is zero for temperatures t  tc, and m
is nonzero for t < tc (long range order), where tc is the critical temperature.
although (for specic ising models) the magnetization m changes continuously
from zero (t  tc) to nonzero values for t < tc (thus the phase transition is
continuous, since m is a rst derivative of fb), the magnetization m as function of
t is nonanalytic at t = tc, i.e. the left and right derivatives of m with respect to
t dier at t = tc.

for quantum eld theories the analogue of the free energy is the generating func-
tional w (e.g. eq. (1.12)) of connected green functions. the above classication
of phase transitions applies to qfts too. an order parameter can usually be given
in terms of a rst derivative of w , and we speak of a continuous phase transition
whenever the order parameter changes continuously across the phase boundary.
the phase boundary is then characterized by the non-analyticities of w in certain
couplings.

an important quantity in the study of continuous phase transitions is the correla-
tion length. the correlation length  is the characteristic length scale of uctuations
of a physical quantity such as the local magnetization si around its average hsii.
let us consider the connected two-point correlation function dened by

gc (~ri  ~rj) = hsisji  hsiihsji,

(1.21)

which can be obtained by dierentiating the free energy with respect to external
elds (or sources). the correlation function gc describes local uctuations parallel
to the long range ordering in the system, and the properties of gc are:

gc (~r) 

gc (~r) 

er/

r(d1)/2(d3)/2 ,

r  |~r|  ,

1

rd2+ ,

r  |~r|  ,

(1.22)

where  is called the correlation length, and  is the anomalous dimension.

1.2.1 the scaling hypothesis

a very useful mathematical tool in the study of continuous phase transitions and
critical phenomena is provided by the existence of scaling laws. for a system close to
a critical point separating dierent phases, a set of critical exponents is introduced to
describe both the scaling of thermodynamic quantities, such as a the magnetization
m , specic heat, etc., as well as local ordering, correlations, and uctuations given
in terms of correlation functions and a correlation length .

the scaling laws are motivated by assuming that the only relevant length scale
near criticality is the correlation length . the renormalization group (rg) methods
of kadano and wilson, which will be discussed later on, show that this assumption

1.2 continuous phase transitions

17

is incorrect. apart from the correlation length another length scale is crucial for
understanding critical phenomena, namely the microscopic length scale, e.g. the
lattice spacing a.

there is a threefold way of considering the phenomenon of scaling, namely, the
scaling form for the so-called equation of state (eos), the scaling form for the
singular part of the free energy, and the scaling form for the correlation function.

1.2.2 the scaling hypothesis for the equation of state

the equation of state for an order parameter (which characterizes a certain phase
of the system) can be obtained by dierentiating the free energy of the system with
respect to some external local source or external eld, to which the order parameter
is coupled. in the context of magnetic systems, the eos of a magnet is written as

h = fe(m, t ),

(1.23)

where h is the external magnetic eld, m the spontaneous magnetization, and t
the temperature (fe follows from the thermodynamics of some microscopic model).
it is implicitly assumed that there is some microscopic model, e.g. an ising model
with spins si on a lattice (with lattice spacing a), producing the function fe of
eq. (1.23) relating the macroscopic quantities m , t and h in the thermodynamic
limit. the magnet undergoes a phase transition at t = tc, where for temperatures
t < tc the system exhibits long range order, i.e.
the spins degrees of freedom
become highly correlated and align to form a nonzero magnetization m , even in
absence of an external magnetic eld h = 0. for temperatures t > tc thermal
uctuations dominate the free-energy and spins are randomly oriented giving a zero
magnetization m = 0 at h = 0. this is a typical example of a continuous phase
transition in a thermodynamic system; the order parameter m changes continuously
from zero for t  tc to nonzero values at temperatures t < tc, in the limit h  +0.
based on experimental results, widom [55] discovered that the eos can be
written as a function of a single variable near a critical point t = tc:

h = m fe(cid:16)tm 1/(cid:17) ,

(1.24)

where t = t  tc is the temperature relative to the critical point. thus eq. (1.24)
is a relation between the scaled variables hm  and tm 1/. the function fe is
regular at t = 0, thus we can write
h = fe (0) m  + f 

(1.25)
where the minus sign in f 
e corresponds to t = t  tc < 0, and the plus sign
to t > 0. this notation is used to reect the fact that the function fe though
continuous is not analytic at t = 0 (t = tc). the critical exponent  follows from
eq. (1.25) at t = 0:

e (0) tm 1/,

(t = t  tc)

m  h1/,

t = 0.

(1.26)

18

phase transitions and quantum eld theory

the critical exponent  follows from eq. (1.25) at zero external eld h = 0:

m  t,

h = 0.

(1.27)

the critical exponent  describes the scaling of the magnetic susceptibility , which
is dened as

close to the critical point:

 

,

m

h (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)h=0

  t.

(h = 0)

(1.28)

(1.29)

dierentiating eq. (1.25) with respect to h and putting h = 0 yields the scaling
relation

thus the critical exponent  is not really a new critical exponent.

 = (  1).

1.2.3 the scaling hypothesis for the free energy

the scaling laws for the singular part fs of the free energy fb is written as

fs(t, h) = t2ff(cid:0)ht(cid:1) ,

near criticality, where ff is regular at h = 0. the critical exponent  is related
to the specic heat. the magnetization m is obtained by dierentiation of fs with
respect to the external eld h:

(1.31)

(1.32)

m  

1

kbt

fs
h  t2f 

f(cid:0)ht(cid:1) .

since the scaling of m near criticality is given by the exponent  eq. (1.27), we
nd the scaling law

subsequently the magnetic susceptibility , eq. (1.28), follows from one more dif-
ferentiation of fs with respect to h:

 = 2    .

(1.33)

(1.34)
close to criticality  should tend towards t as h  0, see eq. (1.29). hence we
nd another scaling law

f (cid:0)ht(cid:1) .

  t22f 

after eliminating  in eqs. (1.33) and (1.35) we obtain the rushbrooke scaling law

2    2 = .

(1.35)

 + 2 +  = 2.

1.2.4 the scaling hypothesis for the two-point correlation

functions

the connected two-point correlation function gc longitudinal (i.e. parallel) to
the direction of ordering is dened in eq. (1.22). the scaling hypothesis for the
two-point correlation function reads

gc (r, t, h) =

(1.37)

1

rd2+ fg(cid:0)rt , ht(cid:1) ,

which, in momentum space, after a fourier transformation, has the following form
at zero external eld h = 0

gc (p, t) z ddr eiprgc (r, t, 0) =

1

p2

fg (t/p) .

in analogy with eq. (1.22), the quantity

  t ,

h = 0,

(1.38)

(1.39)

is dened as the correlation length. one can derive that the magnetic susceptibil-
ity should be proportional to the (longitudinal) two-point correlation function in
momentum space

gc (p = 0, t)  ,

thus p  t. then the limit

gives the scaling law

lim
p0

1

p2

fg (t/p)  t,

 = (2  ).

(1.40)

(1.41)

(1.42)

the josephson scaling law follows from the requirement that the singular part
of the free energy fs is independent of microscopic length scales in the limit t  0
and at zero external eld h = 0, thus the only length scale is then given by the
correlation length   t, thus

fs(t, 0)  d  td  t2,

(1.43)

where the last step follows from the denition of the critical exponent  in eq. (1.31)
hence

d = 2  .

(1.44)

20

phase transitions and quantum eld theory

since it involves the dimension d of the system explicitly, eq. (1.44) is referred to
as a hyperscaling law.

the six critical exponents , , , ,  and  are related by the four (hyper)-
scaling laws (1.30), (1.36), (1.42), and (1.44), thus only two of the critical exponents
are independent.

the critical exponents are referred to as universal quantities; they dont de-
pend much on microscopic details of the underlying theory describing macroscopic
quantities. universality means that the critical exponents are determined by only
a few global features of system; the symmetries of the hamiltonian or action, the
dimensionality, and whether or not the forces are short-ranged.

the above mentioned scaling hypothesis for the eos, the singular part of the
free energy and the correlation function, were for a long time predominantly ex-
perimentally motivated, and only landau theory or mean eld theory was capable
of computing explicitly critical exponents. however in landaus mean eld theory,
only one set of critical exponents could be accounted for. these are referred to as
mean eld exponents:

 = 0,

 = 3,

 = 1/2,

 = 1,

 = 0,

 = 1/2,

(1.45)

and the hyperscaling laws are only satised at the critical dimension d = 4. any
other set of critical exponents satisfying the hyperscaling laws would certainly be
inconsistent with mean eld theory. but it is known experimentally that certain fer-
romagnetic systems could be consistently described by critical exponents satisfying
hyperscaling laws, which were clearly incompatible with the mean eld exponents.
the problem of mean eld theory is that it is based on the assumption that the
only relevant length scale near criticality is the correlation length . this appears to
be wrong. in order to account for nonmean eld critical exponents, and anomalous
scaling laws (i.e. the critical exponent  6= 0), the microscopic length scale a  1/
plays a crucial role in the dimensional analysis2 even when the correlation length is
much larger than the microscopic scale or lattice spacing a.

kadano [17] presented an intuitive picture by coarse graining degrees of
freedom, and invented block spin transformations, in which a particular set of spin
degrees of freedom is described by a single spin degrees of freedom. his crucial
assumption is that the hamiltonian for the new coarse grained degrees of freedom
is of the same form as the hamiltonian for the original degrees of freedom, except
that the couplings constants of the hamiltonian now run as functions of a new
larger microscopic length scale corresponding to the coarse grained degrees of free-
dom. kadanos block spin transformations, and the concept of running coupling
constants provided a clear motivation for the scaling hypothesis of widom et al..
however kadanos method could neither give rise to the critical exponents nor

the so-called non-universal quantities, such as fe(0) and f 
e(0) of eq. (1.25). the
aw in kadanos picture is the assumption that the course grained hamiltonian
is of the same form as the original hamiltonian; he assumed that if the funda-
mental hamiltonian described only nearest neighbour spin-interactions, the coarse
grained hamiltonian would also have only nearest neighbour spin interactions. this
assumption is in general not valid. wilson rened the concept of block spin trans-
formation and coarse graining, and his theory the renormalization group (rg)
provides a constructive method to derive the course grained hamiltonian, which he
realized was not necessarily of the same form as the fundamental hamiltonian. in
course graining degrees of freedom new types of interactions can appear, and need
therefore to be taken into account. in this way, wilsons rg methods are capa-
ble of explicitly computing the critical exponents, and non-universal quantities. in
the next section, we will discuss the rg of wilson in the context of quantum eld
theory.

1.3 wilsons renormalization group

this section is an introduction to the essential concepts of the renormalization group
methods of k.g. wilson, refs. [14, 15]. large parts of this section are derived
and compiled from the following references. excellent reviews on the principles of
wilsons rg in statistical mechanics are given in refs. [4, 15], and for quantum eld
theories, in refs. [3, 6, 56, 5], see also [18]. for literature on the fundamental axioms
of euclidean and minkowskian quantum eld theory, and functional integration
techniques we refer to ref. [51], and for a modern view of functional integration see
ref. [52].

wilson elaborated and completed kadanos argument, and his rg method
provides the constructive framework in which to understand critical phenomena,
universality and renormalization. wilsons rg allows for explicit computation of
the relationship between coupling constants at dierent length scales, at least ap-
proximately. the basic meaning of a rg transformation is the redenition or the
change (running) of the coupling constants under a change of scale, and a rescaling
of the elds, and to allow for the possibility that new local operators are generated
during the rg transformation.

we will present the renormalization group (rg) in three steps. the rst step is
a concrete realization of the coarse-graining transformations, and in the language of
qft it means that we have to construct a low-energy eective action or regulated
action dening a particular generating functional from which the rg transforma-
tions can be derived (in principle). the second step is the identication of the origin
of critical phenomena and singular behavior with the existence of xed points of
the rg transformations. also we discuss the concept of relevant, marginal, and
irrelevant interactions (operators), and the ow of coupling constants close to a
particular xed point. finally, in step three we discuss renormalization, and the

22

phase transitions and quantum eld theory

continuum limit of qfts.

1.3.1 step 1. regularization and coarse graining

let us consider the following generating functional described by some fundamen-
tal action sf in d dimensional euclidean space time, which is obtained after a
standard wick rotation [57]

z [k, j] = nz d exp{sf [k, ]  sj [j, ]},
sf [k, ] = z ddx

kioi [(x)] ,

nf

xi=1

(1.46)

(1.47)

where the k = (k1, k2, . . . , knf ) are a set of nf coupling constants (some of which
have a dimension), and where the oi are some local operators of the elementary
elds  = (1, 2, . . . , a), thus

d =

a

yi=1

di.

(1.48)

in the euclidean formulation, we suppose that the oi are positive operators, and
that the couplings ki take only nonnegative values, so that the action is positive
and the generating functional well-dened, see also the discussion in section 1.1
and [52]. the source action sj is of the form eq. (1.3).

the initial step in wilsons approach is to introduce a cuto  in the action. a
convenient way to do that is by using the generalized paulivillars regularization
(see ref. [58, 6] and e.g. [59] and references therein). we dene the regularized
action,

sreg

 [k, ] = npv()z dpv exp{spv

 [k, , pv]},

(1.49)

where the elds pv are a set of paulivillars elds. an example of such an action
spv
 for scalar eld theory is

spv

 [k, , pv] = z ddx(cid:20) 1

2

( + m2) 

1
2

pv( + 2)pv

+ v ( + pv)(cid:21),

where the initial action sf was

sf [k, ] =z ddx(cid:20) 1

2

( + m2) + v ()(cid:21).

(1.50)

(1.51)

1.3 wilsons renormalization group

23

the mass m and the potential v are dened in terms of the coupling constants k,
and yet unspecied local operators.

the basic principle of pauli-villars regularization methods is that any internal
propagator of  is replaced after the regularization by the sum of the  and pv
propagators:

1

p2 + m2 

1

p2 + m2 

1

p2 + 2 .

(1.52)

for modes of  corresponding to energies p2  2 the propagator is of the form

1

p2 + m2 

1
2 +

1
2o(p2/2),

(1.53)

whereas for modes of  corresponding to energies p2  2 the propagator vanishes
as fast as 2/p4 making feynman diagrams nite. in the continuum limit   
the original propagator is recovered. the paulivillars eld pv does not corre-
spond to a physical particle, since the action cannot be based on a hermitian
hamiltonian, see chapt. 7 of zinnjustin [6].

in the abstract example given above, we introduced only a single paulivillars
eld; in general more paulivillars elds are needed to render all feynman diagrams
nite. the paulivillars regularization seems to work very well for abelian gauge
theories describing the interaction between fermions such as qed, since it is possible
to regularize in a gauge invariant manner keeping the lorentz covariance. more-
over the paulivillars regularization is supposed to work also nonperturbatively.
a problem turns up when considering symmetries of an initial action sf . after
regularization it might be the case that a continuous symmetry of the initial action
is lost in the regularization process by the appearance of operators, which violate
that particular symmetry. such a violation of the symmetry is called an anomaly.
an example in fermionic gauge eld theories is the well-know adlerbelljackiw
u (1)-axial anomaly, refs. [60, 61], see also section 2.2.

let us consider the regularized action eq. (1.49) in more detail. the functional
integral over paulivillars eld pv introduces a smearing of interactions at modes
of  with energy scale e  . due to such smearing eects the action sreg
is
nonlocal in the elds . suppose we split the elds  into high- and low-energy
parts:



 = h + l,

(1.54)

where the energy e = |p| >  for h and e   for l. then, since the pauli
villars construction is such that the high energy modes h are canceled by the
paulivillars elds, the action is independent of h. the remaining elds l are
of energy e < , and the action sreg
is approximately local in low energy modes
with e  . the idea is that the nonlocal action sreg
can be expanded in terms





24

phase transitions and quantum eld theory

of local operators oi:

sreg
 [k, ] = sef f

 [(), l] =z ddx



xi=1

i()ddc

i oi [l(x)] ,

(1.55)

where we have introduced the dimensionless running coupling constants

() = (1(), 2(), . . . , ()),

(1.56)

and new local interactions oi [l(x)], i = nf , . . . ,. since the action is dimension-
less, dc

i is the canonical dimension (in units of mass) of the operator oi,

dim [oi] = dc
i .

(1.57)

now that we have an action spanned by a space of an innite number of couplings
and operators oi, the question arises: how can this be useful?

the crucial observation is that operators and corresponding coupling constants
can be classied as relevant or irrelevant. it will turn out that it is sucient to con-
sider only the (in practice) nite set of operators oi (1 < i  n) and corresponding
coupling constants, which are relevant with respect to a particular xed point, (see
later discussion in this section), so we write

sef f

 [(), l] z ddx(cid:26) n
xi=1

i()ddc

i oi [l(x)] + irrelevant(cid:27),

(1.58)

and the property of theirrelevant part describing the irrelevant operators and
couplings is that it gives rise to corrections to green functions in terms of posi-
tive powers of e/, and the irrelevant part becomes negligible for e suciently
smaller than  (e  ).
the apparent straightforward decomposition of s into l and h, eq. (1.54),
is in practice nontrivial and rather technical. the functional space of elds  is
chosen such that the (x) have fourier transforms:

(x) z ddp eipx (p).

(1.59)

then think of l in terms of fourier modes (p) with e = |p|  , and h as modes
(p) with e = |p| > :
l z|p|

h z|p|>

ddp eipx (p),

ddp eipx (p).

(1.60)

in this way, the measure n ()r dl introduces a momentum cuto  in the sdes

for the momentum space green functions. for technicalities involved in the pro-
jection leading to eq. (1.54), and the cuto , we refer to [51] (chap. 8).

1.3 wilsons renormalization group

25

if we compare this local low-energy eective action sef f

 , eq. (1.58), with the
fundamental or initial action sf of (1.47), we see that new coupling constants i()
and new operators oi with n  i > nf have been introduced, and that the couplings
are now dened as functions of . in principle the couplings i()ddc
i can and
will dier from the initial coupling constants ki (i = 1, . . . , nf ) of sf . these new
couplings or new interactions are a results of the nonlocality of the regularized
action sreg
 .

the fundamental notion introduced by wilson is that, through coarse graining
the degrees of freedom, new local operators appear with corresponding couplings
constants, and the coupling constants run as a function of the cuto  (the
cuto is analogous to the microscopic length scale in lattice models a  1/). the
high energy modes h are integrated out thereby introducing new interactions and
running coupling constants.

from the local low energy eective action sef f

 , eq. (1.55), we construct a

generating functional

z [(), j]  n ()z dl exp{sef f

 [(), l]  sj [j, l]},

(1.61)

where the external sources j are introduced to generate the low-energy green
functions (e  ). the sources j explicitly depend on , and in momentum
space we suppose that the sources j(p) vanish for momenta p > . we only probe
physics at a scale e < . the generating functional z should be dened via the
implementation of the sd scheme as discussed in section 1.1, with a normalization
n () so that z [(), j = 0] = 1.

we can repeat the above coarse graining and consider now an eective action

at a cuto  < . split the elds l into:

l = l + h ,

(1.62)

where the energy e is  > e >  for h and e   for l . then we dene a
coarse grained local eective action at scale  as follows:

n () exp{sef f



[(), l ]} = n ()z dh exp{sef f

 [(), l]},

(1.63)

where

sef f


[(), l ] z ddx

n

xi=1

i()ddc

i oi [l (x)] .

(1.64)

in principle the right-hand side of eq. (1.63) corresponds to a nonlocal action for
energy scales scales e  , however again we assume it is well approximated for
energies e <  by the local action sef f
. furthermore, by denition, the coarse


26

phase transitions and quantum eld theory

grained eective action sef f

have the identity

should yield the same generating functional, thus we

z [(), j ] = z [(), j] ,

(1.65)

since

n ()z dl exp{sef f



[(), l ]} = n ()z dl exp{sef f

 [(), l]}.(1.66)

hence the generating functional z is independent of , i.e.



dz
d

= 0.

(1.67)

the identities (1.65) and (1.67) dene a rg transformation r in the space
of coupling constants (thus in the space of actions) mapping couplings () to
couplings ():

() = r [/, ()] .

(1.68)

the rg transformation r can be derived from the generating functional z given
in terms of an low energy eective action sef f
 . since z is dened via the sde,
positivity, and normalization (section 1.1), the solutions (or approximate solutions)
of sdes for the green function of l ultimately provide us with the rg transfor-
mation r. in what follows we discuss the properties of r.

1.3.2 step 2. the origin of singular behavior and anomalous

scaling

the rg transformation r maps couplings () to (),
    1,

() = r [/, ()] ,

(1.69)

where the cutos  and  have been redened as dimensionless quantities related
to the unit energy scale. the transformation r for dierent   1 form a semi-
group. two successive transformations with 1 and 2 should be equivalent to a
combined scale change of 12:

(0) = r [1, (0)] ,
(1) = r [1/0, (0)] ,

(12) = r [2, (1)]

0  1,

1  0,

= r [2,r [1/0, (0)]] ,

2  1,

and thus (taking 0 = 1)

r [12, 0] = r [2,r [1, 0]] ,

0  (1).

(1.70)
(1.71)

(1.72)

(1.73)

1.3 wilsons renormalization group

27

by construction the r satises the above group properties, where we recall that
the transformation r follows from eq. (1.65).
the dierential form of the rge can be obtained by taking 2 = (1  ) in
eq. (1.72) and taking the limit   +0:

1

di(1)

d1

=

ri [2, (1)]

2

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)2=1  i((1)),

(1.74)

where the i function is dened with respect to the particular coupling i of the set
of couplings  = (1, 2, . . .). the dierential rg equation (1.74) follows from the
dierential identity, eq. (1.67), for the generating functional.

a crucial step, in understanding anomalous scaling behavior and critical phe-
nomena, is the recognition of the importance of xed points of the rg transfor-
mation. a xed point of the rg transformation is a point c in coupling constant
space satisfying

c = r [, c] = (c) = 0,

(1.75)

for any  < 1. a xed point is a property of the transformation r, that, in general,
corresponds to nonanalytic behavior, hence it can only appear in a system with
innitely many degrees of freedom [7]. fixed points are not necessarily isolated
points. it is possible to have lines or hypersurfaces of xed points, in fact in a large
part of this thesis we consider a critical line or curve. moreover, a rg transformation
can have several isolated xed points.

the xed points are either classied as critical xed points, or as gaussian xed
points. in the context of quantum eld theory, we refer to a critical xed point or an
ultraviolet (uv) xed point, if the continuum limit (i.e. taking the cuto   )
corresponds to an interacting theory, in which a macroscopic quantity such as a
correlation length   1/m (where m is a mass) can be dened. an uv xed point
of a  function of coupling i is a point c with the properties:

(c) = 0,

i()

i

< 0.

(1.76)

we speak of a trivial or gaussian xed point if in the continuum limit the interac-
tions between elds (and thus particles) vanish, and the theory reduces eectively
to a free eld or gaussian theory. in general a gaussian xed point can be classied
as being an ir xed point, i.e.,

(c) = 0,

i()

i

 0.

(1.77)

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)=c

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)=c

thus close to a trivial or gaussian xed point (corresponding to noninteracting the-
ories), a macroscopic quantity such as a correlation length is not dened (there are

28

phase transitions and quantum eld theory

no correlations at all). an uv xed point corresponds to interacting theories, and
a correlation length  can be dened; right at the critical xed point the correlation
length diverges  =  (m = 0), see section 1.3.3.
the critical xed points will describe singular critical behavior, such as phase
transitions, and can correspond to phase boundaries, separating two distinct phases
of a model (whether or not a phase boundary exists depends on the so-called co-
dimensions of the xed point (see ref. [4]).) thus knowledge of the location of
and nature of xed points of a rg transformation enables the phase diagram to be
determined, and vice versa. we will show now that the critical exponents follow
from the rg transformation in the neighbourhood of a critical xed point.

let us consider the rg transformation close to a critical point c,

i() = ci + i(),

(1.78)

(1.79)

(1.80)

where the matrix m is dened as

mnm(/) 

rn [/, ]

m

the semi-group property of eq. (1.73) implies that

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)=c

.

(1.81)

mnl(/)mlm(/) = mnm(/).

(1.82)

the equation (1.80) is called the linearized rg transformation in the vicinity of
the xed point. the matrix m is real, but in general not symmetric. however, we
assume that m is diagonalizable, with real eigenvalues. therefore, for simplicity,
we assume that for a particular set of couplings  the matrix m is diagonal:

mnm(/) = (n)(/)mn,

so that

n() = (n)()(),

 = /.

3using the einstein summation convention.

(1.83)

(1.84)

1.3 wilsons renormalization group

with eq. (1.83) this implies that

(n)(/)(n)(/) = (n)(/).

thus, the solution to the eigenvalue (n) is

(n)() = n ,

29

(1.85)

(1.86)

where the exponent n is independent of , in general the exponent is a function
of the critical point, i.e. n  n(c). now we can distinguish three cases, since
 < 1:

(1) (n)() > 1, i.e. n < 0, which corresponds to an eigenvalue of a relevant

coupling n.

(2) (n)() = 1, i.e. n = 0, which corresponds to an eigenvalue of a marginal

coupling n.

(3) (n)() < 1, i.e. n > 0, which corresponds to an eigenvalue of an irrelevant

coupling n.

the marginal eigenvalues usually correspond to logarithmic corrections to scaling.
eq. (1.84) implies then that for a relevant coupling () increases as  decreases;
for a marginal coupling () stays xed (up to logarithmic corrections); and for
an irrelevant coupling () shrinks. thus the irrelevant couplings ow towards
the xed point for   1, whereas the relevant couplings ow from the xed point.
the terms relevant, marginal, and irrelevant couplings (eigenvalues) are always
dened with respect to a particular xed point.

so we have seen that from the rg transformation r we obtain the xed points
c, the rg ows near a particular xed point can be decomposed into relevant,
marginal, and irrelevant couplings, and from the eigenvalues (n) close to the xed
point we can derive the critical exponents n. the critical exponents n, for
many practical explicit cases, can be shown to be related to the critical exponents
dened in section 1.2. thus the rg transformation r enables us to calculate the
critical points and critical exponents. in a mean eld approach the exponents have
rational values, whereas in general they can have irrational values. in a case where
critical exponents dier from the canonical (i.e. mean eld) values we speak of
anomalous scalings, or anomalous dimensions. the dynamics (which determine r)
of the system under consideration are such that uctuations around some mean-
value of operators cannot be neglected.

let us discuss some examples. close to a xed point, it follows straightforwardly
from eq. (1.84) that the  function for a coupling n of a set of couplings ()4,
can be written as

dn

n()  

4for which the matrix m (eq. (1.81)) is diagonal.

d  n(c)n + o(cid:0)()2(cid:1) ,

n = n  cn,

(1.87)

30

phase transitions and quantum eld theory

where n(c) < 0 implies that n is a relevant coupling, and n(c) > 0 implies
that n is irrelevant. now dierentiating n with respect to n,

n()

n (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)=c

 n,

(1.88)

(1.89)

(1.90)

(1.91)

leads, with eqs. (1.76) and (1.77), to the conclusion that c is an uv xed point
for a relevant coupling, and c is an ir xed point in case of an irrelevant coupling.
more complicated are in general the marginal couplings. consider the following

rg of a single marginal coupling :

() = r [/, ()] ,
()

r [/, ()] =

1 + () (c  ()) log / .

then, when () is ne-tuned suciently close to c so that we can write

() =(cid:0)1 + ()2 log /(cid:1) (),

clearly the eigenvalue of this equation is not of the form eq. (1.86) due to the
logarithmic correction, which is typical for marginal couplings. the  function can
be obtained from eq. (1.74) and (1.90), and reads
() = 2(c  ).

(1.92)

thus the  function has two xed points,  = 0, respectively,  = c. according
to the denitions given by eqs. (1.76) and (1.77)  = c is an uv xed point, and
 = 0 an ir xed point.

in practical applications of the rg method to quantum eld theories, it turns out
that the actual computation of critical xed points is highly complicated, even more
so when more than one coupling is relevant or marginal, therefore it is sometimes
useful to address the problem in the following manner. consider a model with two
coupling constants 1 and 2, then the xed point c = (c1, c2) is a solution of

1(1, 2) = 0,
2(1, 2) = 0.

(1.93)

(1.94)

suppose we rst solve 1 for 1, and we assume that the solution can be expressed
in terms of a function f with the property

then c2, provided that it exists, follows from the solution(s) of

1 = f (2)  1(f (2), 2) = 0.

2(f (2), 2) = 0,

(1.95)

(1.96)

and c1 = f (c2). the above sketched method is particularly useful when the
function 1 has a much simpler structure than the function 2, i.e. the function f
is rather easy to determine from eq. (1.93).

1.3 wilsons renormalization group

31

1.3.3 step 3. renormalization and ne-tuning

the renormalization of a qft can be considered as the rg transformation of a
set of so-called bare couplings () dened at an uv cuto  to a set of couplings
(), where    is some energy scale related to the resolution of an experimental
apparatus (think of particle accelerators). thus the couplings () are assumed
to be related to experimentally measurable quantities (of course only interacting
particles are measurable). then if the limit

() = lim

r [/, ()] ,

(1.97)

(with  xed) exists and can be arranged in such a way that the set of couplings ()
describe an interacting theory5, then this particular qft is said to have a nontrivial
continuum limit. that is, the set of couplings () (macroscopic quantities)
obtained from experiments are independent of any microscopic length scale 1/.
when a nontrivial continuum limit does not exists, it does not necessarily imply
that the corresponding qft is useless, such a model can still be used as a low
energy eective eld theory for physics corresponding to energies e  , where the
cuto  now has physical implications. for gauge theories, the ward-takahashi
identities (or slavnovtaylor identities for non-abelian gauge theories) reecting
the local gauge symmetry are crucial for a non-trivial continuum limit to exist.

the arrangement of the continuum limit, as mentioned previously depends on
the so-called ne-tuning of relevant and marginal interactions. in order that the
couplings () coincide with e.g. experimental values, one has to choose partic-
ular values for the relevant and marginal bare couplings () which lie in the
neighbourhood of a critical xed point. this is referred to as ne-tuning.

now that we have a method to identify couplings  and, consequently, the
corresponding operators o as relevant, marginal and irrelevant, the question arises;
why are irrelevant interactions irrelevant? the answer is: irrelevant interactions or
couplings do not have to be ne-tuned, and their eect can completely be absorbed
by suitable modications of the ne-tuning of relevant and marginal couplings. as
a result, the eect of irrelevant interactions in the infrared region is suppressed by
factors (/) with  > 0. from eqs. (1.84) and (1.86), and assuming i() is
suciently close to ci we obtain that

i()  i(i  ci) = i()  ci + (/)i (i()  ci).

(1.98)

thus, if i > 0 (i.e. i is irrelevant) the value of i() is insensitive to the bare value
i() for   , and i() approaches the ir xed point ci; the eect of i()
is suppressed by a factor (/)i . this also means that the ir xed point of an
irrelevant coupling is determined in terms of the relevant and marginal couplings.
however, if i < 0 (i.e. i is relevant) the second term on the right-hand side
of eq. (1.98) dominates, for   , and the only way to get a small value for ()

5at least one i of the set of couplings () should have a non-gaussian value.

32

phase transitions and quantum eld theory

in the infrared is to ne-tune i() precisely to the uv xed point ci. marginal
couplings (i = 0), because they usually are described by logarithmic scaling, are
less restricted in the ne-tuning process.

the relevant and marginal couplings with uv xed points correspond to in-
teracting theories, and a correlation length  = 1/m can be dened; right at the
critical xed point the correlation length diverges  =  (thus zero mass m = 0).
usually the correlation length can be identied with a physical observable, and in
order to get a nite nonzero value for m, this requires ne-tuning of bare couplings.
suppose we have a model with one coupling  describing interactions, then



d
d

= () = log /m =

()

z(m)

d
()

,

m = 1/.

(1.99)

thus, keeping the correlation length  = 1/m xed, in the continuum limit   
the integral on the left-hand side diverges to +. hence, in order that the right-
hand side diverges too, () has to be ne-tuned to c for an uv xed point
(provided that  has a rst order zero (or higher) at c).

in order to pin-point whether a coupling is irrelevant or not, the critical exponent

i is usually written as

i = dc

i  d  i,

(1.100)

where dc
i is the canonical dimension dened in eq. (1.57), d dimension of the space-
time manifold, and i dened as the anomalous dimension of the corresponding
operator oi. the existence of an anomalous dimension is a result of (non-trivial)
dynamics near a critical point, and therefore the quantity

ddyn
i  dc

i  i

(1.101)

is called the dynamical dimension of the operator oi. by neglecting the eect of
dynamics, thus neglecting i, i is determined by the canonical dimension dc
i of the
operator oi (this is referred to as naive dimensional analysis). by so comparing the
eective actions (1.55) and (1.64), we expect the couplings  to have the scaling
relations

()  () (/)ddc

= (()) = (dc  d)().

(1.102)

in this context, operators with dc > d are labeled naively irrelevant, and the anoma-
lous dimension , eq. (1.100), can turn naively irrelevant operators into relevant
(or marginal) ones, and vice versa.

since the generating functional is functional integral of the eld degrees of free-
dom, we can rescale the fundamental elds  = (1, 2, . . .). this is equivalent
to a redenition of couplings and sources, see zinn-justin chapt. 8 [6]. the cou-
plings which correspond to a rescaling of the fundamental degrees of freedom (i.e.

1.3 wilsons renormalization group

33

the elds) are called z factors, and the remaining couplings g are physical cou-
pling constants. for instance, suppose for a theory with two fundamental elds
 = (1, 2), the action sef f
 eq. (1.55) contains a term  ioi [1, 2], then we
dene:

gi()z n/2

1 (, g())z m/2

2

(, g())  i(),

(1.103)

where the operator oi contains n powers 1, and m powers of 2, and where g =
(g1, g2, . . .) is the set of physical coupling constants. with such a redenition
of coupling constants, the connected green functions now implicitly depend on
couplings g only. renormalizability is now the statement that a connected green
function6

(1.106)

the identities eq.(1.105) and (1.106) follow in theory from the rg invariance of the
generating functional, eq. (1.65), and the sde (1.11). they are supposedly exact7,
if the generating functional is spanned by the entire (innite) set of operators oi.
however, the rg method tells us we only need to take into account the relevant and
marginal operators, and then the identity is an approximate one, with corrections
of the irrelevant type (e.g. (e/)n, n  0, and e   in momentum space). as
an example consider a connected two-point green function (see eq. (1.12)):

g(2)

where g(2)

c [p, , g] is the fourier transform of g(2)

c [x, y, , g].

6we introduce the notation hiconnected for connected time-ordered vacuum expectation values.
7though a proof of the indentities eq.(1.105) and (1.106) is highly nontrivial, and cannot be

given for most practical applications of qft beyond perturbation theory.

analogous to eq. (1.105), we have the identity

z(, g)g(2)

where a, b, are nonuniversal constants, the exponent 1 is positive (1 > 0), and
m = 1/. then such an asymptotic behavior approximately satises the callan-
symanzik eq. (1.110) (i.e. up to corrections of the irrelevant type) provided the
physical couplings are close to their critical values, i.e. i(g)  0.
naive dimensional analysis implies that z is of the marginal type,  = 0, hence
 is referred to as twice the anomalous dimension of the eld , or in fact the anoma-
lous dimension of the kinetic term. the above derivation of the callansymanzik
equation for a two-point green function can straightforwardly be generalized for
arbitrary n-point green functions.

in the context of renormalizability, we conclude this section by mentioning some
properties of gauge theories. as mentioned previously, gauge symmetries are con-
tinuous local symmetries of the classical action, and give rise to wardtakahashi
identities. these so-called wtis follow in principle from the sdes, and are crucial
in determining whether or not a nontrivial continuum limit exists.

a problem connected with the gauge symmetry is the gauge xing procedure.
the problem occurs in the functional integration, where the integration of paths,
which are mutually connected by gauge transformations, and hence have the same
functional weight, give rise to uncontrollable innities. to control these innities,
one has to gauge x the generating functional. the brst formalism, see for an
introduction ref. [64], takes care of this gauge xing mechanism, and for qed (and
thus the gnjl model) it is similar to the guptableuler formalism.

1.4 the goldstone mechanism

35

1.4 the goldstone mechanism

the goldstone theorem was rst suggested by goldstone [65] and later proved
by goldstone, salam, and weinberg [66]. many textbooks on qft discuss the
goldstone mechanism extensively; we refer to refs. [3, 2]. the rst example of the
goldstone mechanism in relativistic particle physics is given by the nambujona-
lasinio model, [1], where the chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken.

spontaneous symmetry breaking is the phenomenon that an invariance of the
action of a model (i.e. a symmetry on the dynamical level) is not an invariance of its
vacuum. if the broken symmetry is a continuous one, it gives rise to the goldstone
mechanism.

in classical eld theory, a continuous symmetry described by a lie group g of
an action implies, according to noethers theorem, the existence of conserved local
currents ja

(x)

ja

(x) = 0,

(1.114)

with a = 1, 2, . . . , n, where n is the number of the group generators. then the space
a dene conserved charges qa
integrals of the time component of the currents j
corresponding to continuous symmetry (by implementation of the stokes theorem
neglecting surface terms):

qa z d3x ja

0 (x) 

d
dt

qa(t) = 0.

(1.115)

the charges qa can be considered as the generators of the lie group g, i.e. the
action or lagrangian is invariant under unitary transformations of the fundamental
eld 

u ()  g,

   = u ()u (),

u () = exp{iaqa}.

(1.116)

the innitesimal transformations a  1 of operators oi of elds  are generated
by qa:

oi [] = ia{qa, oi []},

(1.117)

where { , } is the poisson bracket. in quantum eld theory the poisson bracket is
replaced by a commutator if q is a bosonic operator or by an anti-commutator if
q is fermionic .

in a quantum eld model with a conserved current operator ja

(x), spontaneous
symmetry breaking is now characterized by the condition that there exist an oper-
ator oi for which

h0|oi []|0i 6= 0,

(1.118)

36

phase transitions and quantum eld theory

thus at least one of the charges qa of eq. (1.117) does not annihilate the vacuum;
the vacuum is not invariant under the continuous symmetry transformation.
if
the operator oi [] breaking the invariance of the vacuum is a composite operator,
instead of being a single eld, we speak of a dynamically broken symmetry.

the goldstone theorem states the following. consider a lorentz and transla-
tional invariant local eld theory, with conserved currents j
a relating to a lie group
g. assume that this symmetry is spontaneously broken so that eq. (1.118) holds.
then there are massless particles (the nambugoldstone (ng) bosons) with the
same quantum numbers as the operators oi[], which couple both to the currents
ja
 and operators oi[]. the ngbosons are indeed bosons if the oi[] is a bosonic
operator, however in general this need not be the case.

the degeneracy of the vacuum in a theory with a spontaneously broken symme-
try is connected with existence of a phase transition in the model, hence vacuum
degeneracy can only occur in systems with innitely many degrees of freedom.

in the framework of sdes a particular continuous symmetry gives rise to so-
called green-wardtakahashi or wardtakahashi identities, and the existence of a
massless particle follows from the low-energy limits (p  0) of corresponding ward
takahashi identities. these low-energy relations are very useful when a symmetry
is not completely exact, but explicitly broken by a small external eld (think of the
external eld h in magnetic systems, or a bare particle mass m0 in case of chiral sym-
metry). if the spontaneous symmetry breaking mechanism is much stronger than
the explicit symmetry breaking, then one can derive, in case of chiral symmetries
(see next section), the partial-conserved-axial-current (pcac) relations.

let us discus now the specic case of dynamical chiral symmetry breaking.

1.4.1 chiral symmetry

chiral symmetry is a special continuous symmetry of massless fermions. in nature,
most fermions that we know of do have masses (even neutrinos are not (anymore)
believed to be completely massless), hence the chiral symmetry is a broken symme-
try. consider the following lagrangian in 4 dimensions,

l = (x) d(x),

(1.119)

where d = d is a covariant derivative supposedly containing gauge interactions.
then, the lagrangian is invariant under the chiral transformations

   = ei5,

   =  ei5,

where  is some arbitrary parameter, and the 5 matrix is dened as

5 = i0123 = 
5,

{, 5} = 0,

2
5 = 1.

(1.120)

(1.121)

1.4 the goldstone mechanism

37

the chiral symmetry implies that the lagrangian can be written in terms of left-
handed, and right-handed spinors,

l =(cid:18) 1 + 5

2 (cid:19) ,

r =(cid:18) 1  5

2 (cid:19) ,

so that

l = l dl + r dr.

(1.122)

(1.123)

a mass term m0  is not invariant under the chiral transformations, and the la-
grangian with mass term would read

l = l dl + r dr  m0 lr  m0 rl.

(1.124)

thus a mass term mixes the left-handed and right-handed spinors. the chiral
symmetry gives rise to a conserved axial current:

j5 = 5,

j5 = 0.

(1.125)

with a bare mass term, the chiral symmetry is explicitly broken and the current is
not conserved

j5 = m0 i5.

(1.126)

the current j5 denes a charge q5 as the generator of the chiral symmetry.

in the framework of spontaneous symmetry breaking given by eq. (1.118), let

us consider a composite pseudoscalar operator o(cid:2) , (cid:3) = (x)i5(x). under the
innitesimal chiral transformations (1.120) (i.e.   1), the operator transforms as
(1.127)

if now, in absence of bare masses in the lagrangian (1.119),

(cid:0) i5(cid:1) = 2 .

h0|(cid:0) i5(cid:1)|0i 6= 0 = h0| |0i 6= 0,

(1.128)

we conclude that the chiral symmetry is dynamically broken (i.e. spontaneously
broken by a composite operator). the goldstone theorem implies the existence of
a massless pseudoscalar particle (a pion).

by using the chiral symmetry, we can always rotate in such a way that the
spontaneous symmetry breaking or long range order is in the same direction
(in the space spanned by the operators  and i5) as the explicit symmetry
breaking caused by a bare mass term m0  term, i.e.
h0| |0i 6= 0.

h0| i5|0i = 0,

(1.129)

38

phase transitions and quantum eld theory

thus the long-range order is in the direction of the bare mass operator . then
correlations

of the operator  are referred to as longitudinal, and correlations

h0|t (cid:0) (x) (0)(cid:1)|0iconnected
h0|t(cid:0) i5(x) i5(0)(cid:1)|0iconnected

(1.130)

(1.131)

of the operator i5 are transverse to . the massless ngboson is described by
the correlations transverse to the direction of ordering. it means that it costs a small
amount of energy to change the direction of ordering in the transverse direction.

1.5 the gauged nambujona-lasinio model

let us introduce the gauged nambujona-lasinio (gnjl) model. the gnjl model
is the gauged version of the rst model describing dynamical breaking of chiral
symmetry in particles physics, i.e. the nambujona-lasinio model [1]. if the gauge
symmetry is u (1), the gnjl model can also be consider as qed with additional
four-fermion interactions. bardeen, leung, and love proposed to study the gnjl
model in refs. [12, 13]. they argued that, due to the appearance of large anomalous
dimension for the four-fermion operators, the formally irrelevant operators become
marginal at the critical gauge coupling 0 = c of qed.

the interest in the gnjl model has been stimulated by its importance for con-
structing extended technicolour models (etc) and top-quark condensate models.
for an extensive introduction to such models see [3].

the gauged njl model is described by the lagrangian

l1 = (id  m0) 

1
4

f f  +

g0

2 (cid:2)( )2 + ( i5)2(cid:3) ,

(1.132)

where d =  + ie0a is the covariant derivative, and where g0 is the dimen-
sionful coupling constant8 of the chirally invariant four-fermion interaction. since
the canonical dimension of fermion elds is 3/2, the dimension of g0 is negative in
terms of energy units,

dim(g0) = 2.

(1.133)

in other words, the canonical dimension dc, eq. (1.57), of the local operator ( )2
is six, and naively it corresponds to an irrelevant operator.
in the absence of a
fermion mass term m0 which breaks the chiral symmetry explicitly, the lagrangian
(1.132) possesses a u (1) gauge symmetry and a global ul(1)  ur(1) chiral sym-
metry. it is straightforward to extend and consider the gnjl model describing n

8g0 is commonly referred to as the fermi coupling constant.

1.6 the auxiliary eld method

39

fermion avors with a ul(n )  ur(n ) (or uv (n )  ua(n )) chiral symmetry. the
lagrangian of the gnjl model with n fermion avors is described in appendix a,
and the sdes of this model will be given in chapter 2. in chapter 5 the large n
limit of the gnjl model will be analyzed.

1.6 the auxiliary eld method

the four-fermion interaction of (1.132) is quartic in the fermion elds, which is
rather inconvenient for the description of the quantum eld model in terms of
feynman graphs and schwinger-dyson equations. the quartic terms give rise to
two-loop sdes for even the two-point green functions such as the fermion propa-
gator. the problem can be circumvented elegantly by introducing auxiliary chiral
elds  and , which are (real) spinless scalar elds. we can rewrite the lagrangian
eq. (1.132) as follows

l2 = id 

1

f f   ( + i5)

the euler-lagrange equations for the auxiliary elds ,  are

which ensure the equivalence of the lagrangians l1 and l2 on-shell. the lagrangian
l2 is now only quadratic in the fermion elds. the constraints (1.135) represent the
fact that the auxiliary elds  and  describe the scalar and pseudoscalar fermion-
anti-fermion degrees of freedom given by the composite operators  and i5.
in terms of the path integral formalism the equivalence of the lagrangians
(1.132) and (1.134) emerges from the following equality for the generating func-
tional z:

z = nz dd da exp(cid:20)iz d4xl1(, , a)(cid:21)

= n z dd dadd exp(cid:20)iz d4xl2(, , a, , )(cid:21) ,

(1.136)

where n and n  are some normalization constants, and it is implicitly understood
that the integration measure of the gauge eld a includes factors connected with
the gauge xing. the equality in eq. (1.136) is the so-called hubbard-stratonovich
trick or the auxiliary eld method, reintroduced into quantum eld theory by gross
and neveu [67].

the model described by l2 is invariant under the combined chiral transforma-

tions eq. (1.120), and

the conserved axial current j5:

j5 = 0.

(1.138)

with a bare mass the chiral symmetry is explicitly broken as given by eq. (1.126).
after performing a regularization of the generating functional, eq. (1.136), and

sdes of the gnjl model

in this chapter we introduce the schwingerdyson (sde) equations, and the ward
identities for the gnjl model.
in section 2.1 after introducing the generating
functional, we present a derivation of sdes for the green functions in momentum
space. in section 2.2 we review the vector and axial ward identities, and derive
the sde for the axial-vector vertex. in addition the partial conserved axial current
(pcac) relation are discussed briey. finally some basic properties of particles,
resonances and tachyons are mentioned in section 2.3.

2.1 the generating functional

suppose that we have some fundamental action sf analogous to eq. (1.47) (e.g the
action of qed) for which the wilsonian eective action (1.58) given at some cuto
 is the gnjl model. we assume that the gnjl model action can be hypotheti-
cally obtained from sf after a suitable paulivillars regularization as described in
subsection 1.3.1. thus we write in minkowski space

sef f

 [(), l] =z d4x [lgnjl + lgf] ,

(2.1)

where we omit the innite sum of irrelevant interactions. the gnjl model la-
grangian lgnjl describes the local interactions of the elds, and for the gnjl
model with n fermion avors we have

sdes of the gnjl model

where   are the generators of u (n ), c = tr [m  ], and mij = m(i)ij is the
diagonal mass matrix, see also appendix a. the term lgf in eq. (2.1) represents the
gauge xing part of the lagrangian. an additional condition is needed, the gupta
bleuler gauge xing. we use a standard covariant gauge xing with a constant
gauge parameter , i.e.

lgf = 1/2 (a)2 .

in case of the gnjl model the coupling constants and elds are

() = (m0, g0, 0, , z2, z3, z, z),

(2.3)

(2.4)
(2.5)

l = (cid:0)a, , , , (cid:1) ,

the set of bare coupling constants (except ) and renormalization constants are
given by eqs. (1.139)(1.141), and the set of elds l are the low energy modes
analogous to l of eqs. (1.54) and (1.60).

from eq. (2.1) we construct the generating functional analogous to eq. (1.61),

z[j] = n ()z dl expnisef f

 [(), l] + isj [j, l]o ,

(2.6)

where the dependence of z on the cuto  and the couplings () is taken implicitly.
the functional measure is dened as

dl  dad ddd.

(2.7)

we implicitly take the product of measures over all avor, dirac, and lorentz indices
of the elds. the source action sj is given by
xi=1(cid:2)ii + ii(cid:3) +

sj [j, l] =z d4x 

  + j 

(2.8)

n

n 21

x=0

 ,

ja +

where

j = (j, , , j, j).

(2.9)

the sources j are dened in a similar manner as the sources j of eq. (1.61). the
source action denes the response of the system to arbitrary perturbations for which
the sources form a suitable basis. j,  and  are the usual sources of qed, and j
and j are the sources which couple to the auxiliary elds,  and .

as was discussed in section 1.1, the starting point to derive the schwinger-dyson
equations (sde) is the following formal identity for the generating functional (2.6):

z dl expnisef f

 + isjo



l(x)(cid:16)sef f

 + sj(cid:17) = 0,

(2.10)

2.1 the generating functional

43

where l is either one of the ve elds of the model l = a, , , , . from
eq. (2.10) the sde for the propagators and vertices in momentum space can be
obtained.

taking into account that the elds ,  and the sources  and  are grassman
variables, we obtain ve functional dierential equations for the generating func-
tional z. the functional derivates in eq. (2.10) follow from eqs. (2.2), (2.3), and
(2.8). if we then replace the functional integrand by dierentiations with respect
to source terms the equation (2.10) is equivalent to the following set of functional
dierential equations:

we use the standard summation convention, i.e. a respective sum over double
indices (avor, lorentz, dirac indices).

sdes for time-order vacuum expectation values can be obtained by dierentiat-
ing the above expression with respect to various source terms. the above set of ve
functional dierential equations determine the entire structure of our model and
should be considered as the equations of motion.

as was pointed out in subsection 1.3.1, the low energy modes l of eq. (2.5)
give rise to a momentum cuto  in the fourier transforms of these modes, see
eq. (1.60). consequently the cuto  enters the expressions for the momentum
space green functions. therefore we introduce the notation

z

d4p =z|p|

d4p .

(2.16)

44

sdes of the gnjl model

this is referred to as the hard cuto regularization.

2.1.1 condensates

condensates are described as nonzero vacuum expectation values of local operators
at a single space time point, e.g. h0|(x)|0i. because of the translational invariance
of the vacuum, a condensate is independent of the space-time point x, h(x)i =
h(0)i.
most condensates are zero, for instance the vacuum expectation value of a single
vector eld a will be zero due to charge conjugation. the sdes for the chiral
condensates can be derived from sde (2.14) by putting the sources to zero. the
chiral symmetry is used in such a way that all pseudoscalar condensates are zero,

for the scalar condensates we then nd

h0||0i = 0.

h0||0i = c + g0

n

xi=1

 

ii trhis(i)(0)i ,

(2.17)

(2.18)

where is(i)(0) the fermion propagator in coordinate space and tr(cid:2)is(i)(0)(cid:3) is the

fermionic chiral condensate of a specic avor i

 h0| ii|0i  trhis(i)(0)i =z

d4k

(2)4 trhis(i)(k)i .

(2.19)

one should note that when the bare masses of the fermions are identical (the n
fermions are degenerate) the mass matrix m is proportional to the identity matrix
and all condensates vanish except h0|0|0i.

2.1.2 the sde for the photon propagator

the sde for the gauge boson, the photon, is derived from eq. (2.11) by dierenti-
ating with respect to j(y), and in momentum space reads

 id1(q) = i(cid:20)q2g +

(  1)



qq(cid:21)  i (q),

(2.20)

where  (q) is the vacuum polarization dened as

2.1 the generating functional

45

the vector ward-takahashi, which will be introduced in the next section, ensures
that the vacuum polarization tensor is transverse, q(q) = 0, hence we write

 (q) = (q2g + qq)(q2),

(2.22)

in terms of the vacuum polarization (p2). the sde for the photon propagator is
depicted in fig. 2.1. for the feynman rules we refer to appendix c.

the sde for the fermion propagator (see denition in appendix b, eq. (b.21)) in
momentum space follows from eq. (2.13) by dierentiating with respect to bj(y)
and setting sources to zero.1 after fourier transforming the sde in coordinate
space to momentum space, we obtain the sde for the fermion propagator

appendix a).

sdes for the scalar and pseudoscalar follow from eqs.(2.14) and (2.15) by dieren-
tiating with respect to appropriate sources. inverting the equations subsequently to
momentum space by using the denitions given in appendix b, we nd the following
sdes. the sde for the scalar propagator is

2.1.5 sdes of the vertices

in this subsection the sdes of the proper vertices of the gnjl model are intro-
duced. important in the derivation of the sde is the four-point function k (0). in
appendix b we dene the 1-boson irreducible four-point function k (1) in eq. (b.29)
and the 2-fermion 1-boson irreducible bethesalpeter kernel k (2) in eq. (b.28).

the photon-fermion vertex: the sde for the photon-fermion vertex is ob-
tained from eq. (2.11) by dierentiation with respect to  and , and transforming
the equation to momentum space.3 using the denition of k (2) and the sde for
the photon propagator, eq. (2.20), we obtain

sde for the vertex is given in term of the two-photon two-fermion scattering kernel or compton
kernel, see ref. [68].

figure 2.5: the sde for the photon-fermion vertex.

the photon-fermion vertex has a rich tensor structure; it is both a spinor matrix
and a four-vector, and therefore it can be decomposed into 12 spin-vector amplitudes
and 12 coecients. the photon fermion vertex is written as a sum of a longitudinal
and transverse part

(k, p) = 

l(k, p) + 

t (k, p),

where the longitudinal part satises a wardtakahashi identity

q

l(k + q, k) = s1(k + q)  s1(k).

(2.31)

(2.32)

this vector-wardtakahashi (which will be reviewed in the next section) xes four
of the coecients constituting the longitudinal part. the eight remaining ampli-
tudes are referred to as transverse, since they vanish after projection with in-going
photon momentum

q

t (k + q, k) = 0.

(2.33)

the transverse part is written as a product of eight ballchiu tensors [69], t 
eight scalar coecient functions, i((k + q)2, k2, q2),

i , and


t (k + q, k) =

i (k + q, k) i(k + q, k),

(2.34)

where we write for notational convenience the scalar functions as i(k + q, k) 
i((k + q)2, k2, q2). a modication of the t 
4 was proposed in [70]. the tensors are
listed below

in the feynman gauge,  = 1, the transverse scalar functions, i have been computed
to one-loop order by ball and chiu in [69], the extension to a general covariant gauge
 was done by kizilersu et al. [70].

a general constraint on the eight is comes from c-parity transformations. the
full vertex must transform under charge conjugation c in the same way as the bare
vertex, so that

c(k, p)c1 = t

 (p,k).

thus eq. (2.37) together with

2.2 wardtakahashi identities

in this section we review the vector and chiral ward-takahashi identities (wtis),
which reect the gauge invariance and the chiral symmetry of the gnjl model.
wtis represent the symmetry structure of the model in terms of relations between
green functions.

the wtis follow from the sdes eq. (2.11)eq. (2.15) provided the model is
properly regularized.5 but usually the ward identities are derived in a more heuris-
tic way by performing a change of the functional integration variable in the gen-
erating functional. it is then assumed that local unitary transformations leave the
path-integral measure invariant. the invariance of the measure under unitary ax-
ial and vector symmetry transformations gives rise to the vector wtis and chiral
wtis.

2.2.1 vector ward-takahashi identities

in abelian gauge eld theories the u (1) wti corresponding to the local symmetry
plays an essential role in the renormalizability of the model. the wtis constrain
the independent scalings of the model and are crucial for renormalizability.

the u (1) part of the vector symmetry is local, and we assume that the functional
measure dl of eq. (2.7) is invariant under local uv (1) transformations. this state-
ment gives a functional dierential equation for the generating functional consistent
with the sdes as mentioned previously. hence we get for uv (1) transformations
the following functional dierential equation:

0 =(cid:26) 1

+ j  + e0ibj


i bj  e0iai



iai(cid:27)x

z [j] ,

(2.46)

5this is similar to the derivation of noether currents from eulerlagrange equations in classical
eld theory. contrary to what sometimes is believed, wtis are not additional constraints imposed
on the green functions other than already imposed by the sdes.

52

sdes of the gnjl model

from which the wardtakahashi identities for green functions can be generated.
the above expression is to be evaluated at space-time point x. dierentiation of
eq. (2.46) with respect to j gives the well-known identity for photon propagator

qd (q) = 

q
q2 .

(2.47)

this condition for the photon propagator implies that the vacuum polarization
dened in eq. (2.21) is transverse

hence we can write the photon propagator as

q (q) = 0.

d(q) = 

1

qq
q4 ,

(2.48)

(2.49)

where (q2) is the vacuum polarization dened in eq. (2.22).

dierentiating eq. (2.46) with respect to  and  and fourier transforming the

equation to momentum space yields the wti for the photon-fermion vertex,

(k  p)(i)(k, p) = s(i)1(k)  s(i)1(p).

(2.50)

this identity relates the longitudinal part, eq (2.31), of the vertex to the fermion
propagator.

other vector symmetries: for the sake of completeness we also mention here
the suv (n ) wti. this wti follows from suv (n ) symmetry of the gnjl model

where  = 0, . . . , n 21. the rst term on the right-hand side, a, is the anomaly op-
erator which is only present in the ua(1) ward identity ( = 0), it is the well known
adlerbelljackiw axial-anomaly [60, 61] and can be derived from eqs. (2.12),
(2.13), once these equations are properly regularized by paulivillars elds. the
naive assumption is that the functional measure is invariant under local unitary
transformations, however it was shown by fujikawa [71, 72] that this is not the
case, proper regularization of the functional measure shows that the under ua(1)
transformations

(x)  (x) = ei(x)5(x),
(x)  (x) = (x) ei(x)5,

the measure (2.7) transforms as

dl  dl exp(cid:20)2iz ddx (x)a(x)(cid:21) ,

(2.53)
(2.54)

(2.55)

where a is the dened as the anomaly. it was shown by hams [73] that when the
generating functional is regularized with paulivillars elds, the sdes do indeed
generate the anomaly.

in four dimensions, the anomaly term is of the form:

a(x) 

0
4

f f,

(2.56)

where f is the eld strength tensor and  the totally antisymmetric levi-civita
tensor. the anomaly terms represents the explicit breakdown of ua(1) symmetry
due to quantum corrections.

in this thesis we completely neglect the role of the axial-anomaly, since at the
moment it is not clear how to implement it properly in nonperturbative studies
of chiral symmetry breaking. secondly the dynamical breakdown of the ua(1)
symmetry, with neglect of anomaly, serves as a very useful model for the breakdown
of the more (complicated) involved sua(n ) symmetries, which are free of anomalies.

2.2.3 the axial vector vertex and pcac

in this subsection some interesting relations following from the chiral wti (2.52)
are reviewed. from eq. (2.52) we can derive the identity for the axial-vector vertex.
for simplicity the case with a single fermion avor case (n = 1) is considered with
the neglect of the abj-anomaly and the axial-vector vertex is dened as

[is(k)(i)

5 (k, p)is(p)]ab  z d4xd4y eikxipy

and the axial vertex as

cd,ab(0, 0, x, y).

(2.58)

using the denitions given in appendix b the following sde for the axial-vector
vertex can be derived:

(i)

5ab(k + q, k) = (i5)ab +z

d4k1
(2)4 [is(k1 + q)(i5)is(k1)]dc

 (ie2

cd,ab(k1, k1 + q, k + q),

(2.59)

which is depicted in fig. 2.8, with the feynman rules given in appendix c. the
sde for the axial vertex is

(i)5ab(k + q, k) = (5)ab +z

d4k1
(2)4 [is(k1 + q)(5)is(k1)]dc

 (ie2

cd,ab(k1, k1 + q, k + q).

(2.60)

the combination of the previous equation with the sde for the pseudoscalar vertex
eq. (2.41) yields the following relation between the pseudoscalar vertex and axial
vertex6:

(i)5(k + q, k) = (ig0)1ip(q)(i)p(k + q, k).

(2.61)

figure 2.9: the sde for the regular axial-vector vertex.

from this relation it is clear that when the pseudoscalar propagator ip describes
a particle with a physical mass pole at q2 = m2
, the axial vertex 5 also has a pole
at q2 = m2
.

if we now dierentiate eq. (2.52) with respect to (y) and (z) and transform
the equation to momentum space we nd the chiral wti for the axial-vector vertex:

(k  p)

5 (k, p) = s1(k)(5) + (5)s1(p)

 2im0(ig0)1ip(k  p)p(k, p)
= s1(k)(5) + (5)s1(p)  2im05(k, p).

(2.62)

hence the axial-vector vertex is related to the fermion propagator and the pseu-
doscalar vertex via the chiral wti. also we can show that the axial-vector vertex
contains a pole at the physical mass of the pseudoscalar by rewriting the sde
(2.59). using the denitions of the kernels k (1) and k (2), eqs. (b.29) and (b.28),
we obtain from eq. (2.59)

see fig. 2.9. since the bethesalpeter kernel k (2) is dened to contains no four-
fermion poles, i.e., all scalar and pseudoscalars have been subtracted in eq. (b.29),
this regular axial-vertex 
5 now contains no poles at scalar or pseudoscalar masses
and is dened as

5ab(p + q, p) = (i)

5ab(p + q, p)

since the expression can only be proportional to q times a scalar function 5 of q2.
the change of sign results from reversing the fermion-loop or in fact from reversing
direction of q. the denition of (i)
5 is depicted in fig. 2.10. the last term on the
right-hand side of (2.64) contains a pole at the pseudoscalar mass and is subtracted.
the residue of the pole is thus directly related to the pseudoscalar vertex and the
pseudovector polarization (2.65).

a chiral wti exists for this pseudovector polarization which can be obtained
directly from (2.52) by dierentiation with respect to source j(y) of  and a
transformation to momentum space. the chiral wti reads

q

5 (q) = q25(q2) =

2m0
g0

+ 2hi1

p (q).

(2.66)

since the pseudovector polarization contains no pseudoscalar pole it will be nite
at q2 = 0. hence at q2 = 0 we have

using now the fact that

p(q2 = 0) =

since possible mass pole terms have been subtracted, and using the chiral wti
(2.62), we obtain a relation between the pseudoscalar vertex at zero boson momen-
tum and the fermion mass function,

2.2 wardtakahashi identities

57

the identities (2.67) and (2.69) are usually mentioned, in the literature, together
with the zero boson momentum expressions for the scalar propagator and scalar
vertex

were again z(p2) = 1 is assumed. however, these identities are not a straightforward
consequence of the chiral ward identity (2.52), but follow from the (presummed)
analyticity of the generating functional z[j], eq. (2.6), in the sources j, and the
normalization z[0] = 1.8 the analyticity in sources requires that dierentiations
with respect to bare parameters (b0) of z are zero at vanishing sources, i.e.,

nz[j]

bn
0

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)j=0

eq. (2.70) can be derived from the identity

b0 = m0, 0,  , . . . .

(2.73)

2z[j]
m2

0 (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)j=0

and, by making use of eqs. (2.18), (2.19) and (2.25), eq. (2.71) is obtained.

the relations given in this subsection are very important for the low-energy
eective dynamics or the pcac dynamics. suppose that scalar and pseudoscalar
propagators have the following low-energy or infra-red structure:

s(q) =



q2  m2



,

p(q) =



q2  m2



.

(2.74)

then the mass-pole of the pseudoscalar at m also appears as a pole in the axial-
vector vertex, 
5 , and the residue 5(q2) of eq. (2.65) is related to the pion decay
constant f in the following way, see e.g. refs. [3, 74, 75, 76]:

5(0) =

f 2

2hi

,

the chiral wti (2.66) using eq. (2.74) at q2 = 0 implies that

5(0) =

2hi


= f =

2hi
 1/2


,

  z 2

(0),

(2.75)

(2.76)

8this analyticity in the sources j should not be confused with analyticity in bare parameters
such as the gauge coupling 0, since the chiral phase transition is a consequence of nonanalyticity
of z in for instance 0.

58

sdes of the gnjl model

where z is the renormalization constant of the pseudoscalar eld, eq. (1.141). an
approximation to f can be obtained by assuming that, for small q, p(k + q, k) 
p(k, k) in eq. (2.65), this reproduces the well-known pagelsstokars [77] formula

in the dsb phase,

in the chiral limit m0  0, eq. (2.69) together with
eq. (2.66) relates the pion decay constant f, the fermion dynamical mass  and the
vertex p, and can be considered as the generalization of the goldenbergertreiman
relation in the gnjl, see for instance [3, 78]. eq. (2.69) relates the pseudoscalar
vertex to the dynamical mass function. moreover eq. (2.67) tells us that if we
take the chiral limit, i.e., the bare mass m0  0, the pseudoscalar propagator will
describe a massless particle, m = 0, i.e. a goldstone boson.
from the chiral wti one can also derive the relation between uv behavior of
the scalar and pseudoscalar propagators and the scalar and pseudoscalar vertices.
is to be expected that such green functions are asymptotically degenerate, since
the uv o-shell behavior of green functions is not determined by the low-energy
potential describing the dynamically broken chiral symmetry; it is determined by
the behavior of the potential far above the minimum (q  m), where it still is
chirally symmetric (there, s and p are degenerate).

2.3 particles

in the gnjl model the particle spectrum contains in addition to the usual spin-1/2
fermions, and spin-1 gauge-bosons also the spinless composite states of fermion and
anti-fermion, the scalars and pseudoscalars. such particles or states are classied
either as massive respectively massless stable particles, unstable particles (reso-
nances), or as unphysical states called tachyons. suppose we can write a particle
propagator phenomenologically as

(p) 

1

p2  2 ,

(2.78)

where for the time being we ignore spin-structure. the expression is valid for
momenta close to the singularity p2  ||2. stable particles are characterized by
a real positive mass singularity 2  0, resonances by a complex singularity 2 is
complex, and tachyons by an imaginary pole 2 < 0.
masses and decay widths play an important role in the analytic structure of
green functions in the infra-red region. where, by infra-red region, we refer to
momenta close to being on-shell, i.e. p2  ||2.
intermediate and ultra-violet
regions correspond to momenta which are highly o-shell or virtual, p2  ||2. in

2.3 particles

59

coordinate space, this means correlations are considered at distances much shorter
than the correlation length   1/.
it is believed that analysis of sdes in euclidean formulation gives reliable re-
sults in the ultra-violet regions and intermediate regions, i.e., regions where the only
relevant scale is the ultra-violet cuto . however to obtain results describing a
correct analytic structure (from the physical point of view) of green functions in the
infra-red region requires in general a more delicate analysis, and, generally speak-
ing, results are much more sensitive to the various approximations used, see, for a
thorough discussion of complex branch-point singularities of fermion propagators in
the framework of sdes in qed and qcd, the thesis by maris [79].

below, a short overview is given of the various particles states that we will

encounter throughout this thesis.

stable particles: a stable physically observable particle, is believed to have an
asymptotic in and out state and a kallenlehmann representation9, see [44]. a
stable particle such as a fermion or a gauge boson in an abelian theory is described
by a particle propagator with a lorentz structure dened by their spin, and has a
real mass singularity p2 = 2  0 the mass singularity is a branch point on the
positive real axis of the complex p2-plane.

resonances: a resonance is an unstable particle or bound state with a lifetime
  1/, where  is the width (or decay rate) of the resonance. a resonance of
the breitwigner type [80, 81, 79] is described by a complex pole in the particle or
bound state propagator:

(p) 

1

p2  [m  (i/2)]2 ,

(2.79)

which is supposed to be valid for p2 close to the resonance pole, p2  m 2. the
resonance mass m and width  are dened to be real and positive. unitarity of the
s-matrix requires that the complex pole of the propagator lies on a second riemann
sheet of the complex plane of p2, for an explanation of this point see for instance
[81]. when we parametrize the resonance pole with a radius r and angle 

p2 = [m  (i/2)]2  r exp(i),

then the condition

0   < 

(2.80)

(2.81)

9contrary to qcd where there is no such thing as an asymptotic in or out quark propagator,
and hence there is no kallenlehmann representation due to color connement (breakdown of the
cluster property), see [78].

60

sdes of the gnjl model

ensures that the pole lies on the second riemann sheet of p2, where we have used
that the width over mass ratio is positive,


m

=

2 sin 
1 + cos   0.

(2.82)

tachyons: tachyons are described by an imaginary mass pole, and are called un-
physical states, they in fact correspond to particles moving faster than the speed
of light. although such tachyonic particle propagators sometimes occur as solu-
tions of the sdes, they usually correspond to unstable vacuum congurations, i.e.,
they correspond to a local maximum instead of a local minimum of the action, and
rearrangement of the vacuum will remove the tachyonic states from the physical par-
ticle spectrum. for a thorough discussion of tachyonic solutions of bethesalpeter
equations, see [3] and references therein.

2.3.1 the wick rotation

mink = p2

the schwingerdyson equation are formulated in minkowski space, given by the in-
0~p2 can either be positive or neg-
denite metric g. a four-momentum p2
ative. however actual calculations of sdes are preferably performed in euclidean
formulation, which has a denite positive metric, p2
eucl  0. the formulation in
euclidean space considerably simplies the actual computation of feynman graphs
and henceforth the analysis of sdes. once green functions have been obtained
in euclidean space (for space-like minkowski momenta), they are rotated back to
minkowski space, after which they can be analytically continued into the time-like
(physical) momentum region.

the transformation from minkowski space to euclidean space is called the wick
rotation, see ref. [57], and rotates the zero-component or energy component of the
four-momentum to the imaginary axis, p0  ip0. we then replace all minkowski
four-momenta with denite positive euclidean momenta

mink = p2

 p2

0 + ~p2  p2

eucl.

(2.83)

the wick rotation is allowed only if the green functions do not have singularities
in the second and fourth quadrant of the appropriate complex momentum plane. it
is assumed for all practical purposes that this is the case in this thesis.

dynamical chiral symmetry
breaking

dynamical symmetry breaking is a special case of spontaneous symmetry breaking,
where a continuous symmetry is broken through the appearance of a non-vanishing
vacuum expectation value of a composite operator. dynamical symmetry breaking
is governed by the formation of bound states. as was mentioned in the introduction,
the bardeen-cooper-schrieer (bcs) theory of superconductivity is one of earliest
models of dynamical symmetry breaking and the rst model with dynamical chiral
symmetry breaking (dsb) in high energy particle physics is the nambujona-
lasinio model [1].

in this chapter we will discuss the chiral phase transition corresponding to the
dynamical breakdown of the chiral symmetry in the gnjl model in the quenched
ladder approximation treating the four-fermion interaction in the hartree-fock or
mean eld approximation. the quenched ladder approximation will be discussed in
the next section. a combination of strong attractive four-fermion interaction and
gauge interaction will turn out to break the chiral symmetry dynamically by the for-
mation of a chiral condensate, where the chiral condensate eq. (2.19) provides the
order parameter of the dcsb. since the chiral symmetry is a continuous symmetry,
the dcsb gives rise to the goldstone mechanism (see section 1.4), and pcac dy-
namics through the formation of spinless bound states, see subsection 2.2.3. dcsb
leads to a nonzero fermion dynamical mass mdyn and to the appearance of pseu-
doscalar massless nambugoldstone bosons composed of a massive fermion and a
massive antifermion. following ref. [3], the massless ng bosons are characterized
by a large binding energy, and it is argued that the dynamics producing such bound
states should be rather strong.

the setup of this chapter is the following. first, the quenched ladder approxi-
mation is discussed, subsequently the gap equation for the fermion dynamical mass

mdyn following from the sde for the fermion propagator is reviewed. in section 3.3,
we derive the eos for the gnjl model in analogy with eq. (1.23). we discuss the
solutions to the gap equation and the eos, obtain the critical xed point, and de-
rive the scaling laws along with the critical exponents. in section 3.6, the concept
of the conformal phase transition is introduced. finally we discuss the rg ow and
ne-tuning of the four-fermion coupling g0, and compare the results obtained in the
quenched ladder approximation with various lattice results.

3.1 the quenched ladder approximation

in the sd approach, the gap equation has been studied extensively in the so-called
quenched-ladder, i.e. the quenched-planar approximation. in a quenched approxi-
mation only diagrams without fermion loops are taken into account, i.e. the fermion
loops in the vacuum polarization of the photon propagator are neglected1. the
quenched approximation can be considered as an approximation to a theory with
an uv xed point; at such a point the gauge coupling does not run, and the -
function of 0 vanishes:

(0, g0, 0)  

d0
d

= 0.

(3.1)

this is a rather crucial assumption, and the possible existence of an uv xed point
of eq. (3.1) will be investigated in chapter 5.

the ladder or planar approximation is a replacement of the full photon-fermion
vertex  of eq. (2.29) by the bare vertex  (photon lines dont cross), the re-
placement of the bs kernel k (2), eq. (b.28), by a single photon exchange graph.
thus the ladder approximation is based on the following assumptions


ab(k, p)  
ab,

k (2)
cd,ab(p, p + q, k + q)  d(k  p)

ad
cb.

(3.2)

(3.3)

the ladder or planar approximation is assumed to be valid in the landau gauge
only ( = 0) where z(f ) = 1, since then the vector wti (2.50) and chiral wti
(2.62) are satised asymptotically.
in addition to the quenched ladder approximation, the four-fermion interactions
are treated in the hartree-fock approximation.2 this means that quantum correc-
tions corresponding to four-fermion interactions are neglected beyond tree level in
feynman diagrams, and only the coupling to the chiral condensate represented by
the tadpole graphs of fig. 2.2 is taken into account. hence, on the level of sde
for the fermion propagator, in the mean eld approach contributions corresponding

1the quenched approximation can be considered as the limit of zero fermion avors, n = 0, in

the sde for the photon propagator.

2the hartree-fock approximation is a specic mean eld approach.

3.2 the gap equation

to exchanges of virtual scalars and pseudoscalars composites ( and  bosons) are
neglected.

3.2 the gap equation

the sde (2.23) for the fermion mass function  dened by eq. (2.24) is commonly
referred to as the gap equation in analogy with the equation for the energy gap
near the fermi surface of one-fermion excitations in the bardeencooperschrieer
(bcs) theory of superconductivity. pioneering studies on the gap-equation in gauge
theories were performed in refs. [82, 8, 9]. these studies nd a critical coupling
c  1 above which a nontrivial solution for the fermion dynamical mass exists in
the chiral limit, i.e. zero bare mass m0 = 0. as was shown in refs. [83, 84, 85],
the solution for the fermion propagator has moving branch-point singularities in the
complex p2-plane, instead of a real singularity (on physical grounds a real singularity
is required). it is generally believed that the complex branch-points are an artifact
of the ladder approximation. extensive discussion of the gap equation in qed,
qcd and the gnjl are given in e.g. [10, 19, 86, 3, 74, 39, 79]. in quenched qed,
a nontrivial continuum limit can be reached [87, 88, 10, 11, 89].

after taking the trace of the sde (2.23), performing a wick rotation to eu-
clidean momentum x = p2  0, and using eq. (2.18), we obtain the well-known gap
equation for the fermion mass function

(3.9)

at vanishing gauge coupling (0 = 0), the only possible solution to the gap equation
is a constant (x) = 0. hence, at 0 = 0, the gap equation reads

m0


= (g0  1)

(3.10)

this is the famous gap equation of nambu and jona-lasinio [1].

for 0 > 0, the four-fermion coupling g0 comes into play via the uvbc, since
eq. (3.7) does not depend on g0. at present no (nontrivial) analytic solution to the
nonlinear second order dierential equation eq. (3.7) is known, except for the case
of zero gauge coupling, 0 = 0, eq. (3.10).

3.2.1 the linearized approximation

after approximating 2(x) by 2(0) in the denominator of eq. (3.7), the gap equa-
tion becomes linear (though with a nonlinear uvbc) and can be solved straight-
forwardly [87, 10, 90]. in this so-called linearized approximation, the gap equation
reads

x

dx2 (x) + 2

d

(x) +

(3.12)

0) and the ultraviolet (x  2

clearly the linearized approximation is a good approximation in both the infrared
(x  2
0) regions. moreover numerical analysis of e.g.
maris [79] shows that the linearized approximation is valid for the entire range of
momenta, even for momenta close to the branch points (x  2
0).
ometric dierential equation

in terms of the variable u = x/2

0, the equation can be written as a hyperge-

u(1  u)

d2
du2 (u) + 2(1  u)

d
du

(u)  0(u) = 0.

the hypergeometric dierential equation is usually written as

z(1  z)w(z) + (c  (1 + a + b)z)w(z)  abw(z) = 0,

(3.13)

(3.14)

3.2 the gap equation

which has the general solution in terms of hypergeometric functions

w(z) = c1w1(z) + c2w2(z),
w1(z) = 2f1(a, b, c; z),
w2(z) = z1c

2f1(a  c + 1, b  c + 1, 2  c; z),

for c not integer  2.

for the linearized gap equation, the values of a, b, and c are

a = (1 + )/2,
a = (1 + i)/2,

b = (1  )/2,
b = (1  i)/2,

c = 2,
c = 2,

(0  c)
(0 > c)

where

(3.18)

(3.19)

c  /3,
  p1  0/c =p1  40,
  p0/c  1 =p40  1.

thus, the point 0 = c (0 = 1/4) is rather special, since at that point a and b
change from real (0 < c) to complex values (0 > c). therefore, we distinguish
between four specic regimes of gauge coupling:

a the pure nambujona-lasinio (njl) point: 0 = 0,

b the intermediate region: 0 < 0 < c,

c the qed critical point: 0 = c,

d the strong qed region: 0 > c.

for any (real positive) value of 0, the solution w2(u) is irregular at u = 0
(x = 0), and does not satisfy the irbc (3.8). therefore the solution of the linearized
gap-equation is

(x)
0

=(cid:26) 2f1(cid:0)(1 + )/2, (1  )/2, 2;x/2
0(cid:1) ,
2f1(cid:0)(1 + i)/2, (1  i)/2, 2;x/2
0(cid:1) ,

(0  c)
(0 > c)

(3.20)

where 0 has to be determined from the uvbc. thus the irbc (3.8) determines
uniquely the solution of the eq. (3.11), leaving the value 0 = (0) as a free
parameter. the uvbc (3.9) then gives a relation between 0, m0, g0, 0, and the
ultraviolet cuto .

an analogous expression which is valid for 0 > c is obtained by replacing  in
eq. (3.23) by i. special care should be taken at 0 = c ( = 0); at that point,
we should expand eq. (3.23) around  = 0.

functions a and  are symmetric in , they can be analytically continued to values

3.3 the equation of state

67

see eqs. (2.18) and (2.19). from the equation (3.28) for the order parameter h i
and the uvbc (3.9), the fermion mass scale 0 can be eliminated. this yields a
single equation between the order parameter h i, and the bare couplings g0, 0
and the bare mass m0, and the ultraviolet cuto .
in analogy with statistical
mechanics, such an equation is referred to as the equation of state (eos).

for the intermediate region 0 < c, with the assumption 0  , the equation
for the condensate h i can be obtained by substituting eq. (3.23) in eq. (3.28).
similarly, the uvbc can be solved by substituting eq. (3.23) in eq. (3.9). this
gives the following eos for 0 < c:

(3.31)

(3.32)

at the critical gauge coupling 0 = c, the eos is obtained by substituting
eq. (3.25) in eqs. (3.9) and (3.28). this gives

3.4 scaling laws in the chiral limit

the uvbc (3.9) is an eigenvalue equation for 0, and depends on the bare parame-
ters 0, g0, m0 and the uv cuto. in the chiral limit we replace 0 by mdyn, where
mdyn is called the dynamical mass, i.e., mdyn is generated purely by the dynamics
(which is rather strong, since 0, g0 are of order one).

let us now consider the chiral limit m0  0, and look for a nontrivial solution to
the uvbc. for the case of the pure njl model (0 = 0), eq. (3.10) has a nontrivial
solution for g0 > 1, for g0  1 0 = 0 is the solution. in the chiral limit we nd the
scaling law

(g0  0)

(g0 > 0)

mdyn



mdyn



= 0,

= (cid:20)

g0

g0 ln(g0/g0)(cid:21)1/2

,

(3.40)

where we assumed that g0 = g01  1. for the intermediate region (0 < 0 < c)
we have nontrivial solution for 0 from eq. (3.29) for values of the four-fermion
coupling such that g0 > 0. since c() and d() are both positive in this region
the solution to 0 = mdyn is

(g0  0)

(g0 > 0)

mdyn



mdyn

g0

g0 + (cid:21)1/2

,

(3.41)

this scaling law has been obtained in ref. [91].

the sign of g0 determines whether there is a nontrivial solution or not. at the

critical gauge coupling 0 = c, we get the scaling law

(g0  0)
(g0 > 0)

mdyn



mdyn



= 0,

= exp(cid:18) 1/4 + g0
1/4  g0

+ (c)(cid:19) ,

(3.42)

3.4 scaling laws in the chiral limit

69

where g0 = g0  1/4. thus there is only a nontrivial solution at c for g0 > 1/4.
for values of 0 > c the gauge coupling is strong enough by itself to give a
nontrivial solution, so even for zero four-fermion coupling g0 we obtain a nontrivial
solution. by putting m0 = 0 in eq. (3.35) we nd the following solutions:

mdyn



= exp(cid:18)

n
 




+ (0)(cid:19) ,

 =p40  1,

with

 = tan1(cid:20) (0 + g0)
(g0  0) (cid:21) ,

(3.43)

(3.44)

and where n is a positive integer (n = 1, 2, . . .), since we have the physical constraint
that 0 < .
it is explained in [10, 3] and references therein that the largest
value of mdyn (i.e., n = 1) leads to the stable vacuum. by analysis of the bs
equations for the bound state spectrum (in quenched-ladder qed) it is shown that
the solutions with n  2 correspond to tachyonic bound states, whereas the n =
1 solution describes a physical particle spectrum containing massless ng-bosons
(pseudoscalars), and massive scalar particles.

hence, when   0 (0  c) we get

mdyn



= exp(cid:18) 1/4 + g0
1/4  g0

+ (c)(cid:19) exp(cid:18)



40  1(cid:19) .

(3.45)

this is the famous scaling law with the essential singularity, sometimes referred
to as miransky scaling. we will discuss this non-power-like scaling law more
thoroughly in section 3.6.

the critical line in the gnjl model. from the considerations above it is clear
that the gnjl model has a nontrivial chiral phase structure. the chiral symmetry
is dynamically broken for values g0 > 0 or 0 > c. we can now draw a critical
line in the coupling constant plane (g0, 0) separating the chiral symmetric phase
from the chiral broken phase, see fig. 3.1. the critical line is

(3.47)

at g0  1/4, above which the gap equation for the fermion self-energy (p) has a
nontrivial solution. in the continuum formulation using the quenched-ladder ap-
proximation, the critical line was rst obtained by kondo et al. [19] and appelquist

70

dynamical chiral symmetry breaking

et al. [20]. more recently, a phase plot has been obtained in [92] using lattice simula-
tions of the so-called noncompact gnjl model in a mean eld approximation. the
critical line obtained in the continuum formulation and the corresponding phase
diagram obtained by the lattice simulations are in good qualitative agreement.

3.5 the critical exponents and scaling

an interesting one-to-one correspondence between the eos of a magnet eq. (1.24),
and the eos of the order parameter of chiral symmetry breaking in the gnjl
model, i.e. eqs. (3.29) and (3.30), was made independently in refs. [24, 23], and
later in ref. [93].

following refs. [24, 23], we introduce the following correspondence:

 the analog of the magnetization m of eq. (1.24) is the chiral condensate,

m  42h i/3,

which is the order parameter.

 the analog of the external magnetic eld h is the bare mass m0.
 the analog of the temperature t = t  tc is g0 = g0  gc.
 the analog of the magnetic susceptibility , eq. (1.28), is the chiral suscepti-

bility

the critical exponents , , ,  near the phase transition in a magnetic system
were dened in eqs. (1.27), (1.29), (1.26), and (1.39). correspondingly, in the gnjl
model, the critical exponents , , , and  are the dened by the scalings:

(3.53)

where the dynamical mass mdyn can be considered as the inverse correlation length,
mdyn  1, and  is dened by eq. (3.49). again we mention that the mass m
of the  boson is the natural candidate for the inverse correlation length, since the
 boson propagator is the connected correlation function of the eld  describing
correlations parallel to direction of symmetry breaking (i.e. parallel to the direction
of long-range ordering given by the order parameter hi).
as mdyn. the symmetric phase will be analyzed more thoroughly in chapter 4.

however it can be shown that in the broken phase m scales in the same way

substituting eq. (3.30) in (3.29), we can eliminate 0 and rewrite the eos, in

terms of m (eq. (3.48), as

m0


= f (0)m(2+)/(2) + f (0)g0m + 
= mhf (0) + f (0)g0m1/ + i  mf (g0m1/), (3.54)

the critical exponent  can also be obtained from eq. (3.54) by dierentiation

m1  (g0)(1) = g0.

using that

the critical exponent  can be read o directly from the scaling law (3.41),

thus the hyperscaling equation

 = 1/2.

d = 2 + ,

(3.62)

(3.63)

is also satised in d = 4 dimensions. this scaling law follows from scaling laws
(1.36) and (1.44) after elimination of the critical exponent .

the four critical exponents , ,  and  satisfy the hyperscaling relations (3.61)
and (3.63) in the intermediate region 0 < 0 < c (0 <  < 1), hence only two of
them are independent. in the intermediate region the critical exponents have non-
mean eld values, and the observation that the exponents satisfy the hyperscaling
relations, suggest that the theory has a nontrivial continuum limit.

the situation changes at the njl point (0 = 0).

in the limit   1, the
expressions for the critical exponents eqs. (3.55), (3.60), and (3.62) yield mean
eld (or gaussian) exponents ( = 1,  = 1/2,  = 3,  = 1/2)3.

however this result is not completely correct, since we should derive these ex-

ponents from eqs. (3.38) and (3.39). doing so, we obtain

3.5 the critical exponents and scaling

73

where m is the order parameter dened in eq. (3.48). hence the mean eld critical
exponents get logarithmic corrections. this result is well-known.
due to the logarithmic corrections, the hyperscaling relations are violated, and

we have the following inequalities:

4 > 2 + ,

 > (  1).

(3.65)

this violation of hyperscaling is believed to be a sign of triviality meaning that
the eective yukawa-coupling (which couples goldstone bosons to the fermions)
vanishes in the continuum limit. the continuum limit is non-interacting, hence
trivial. this can be seen in the following way. assuming that in the low energy
region the correlation length  is the only relevant length scale, we dene an eective
yukawa-coupling gy by the zero-momentum limit of the scattering amplitude of two
fermions exchanging a scalar bound state in the dsb phase

using the denition of the critical exponents (3.50)(3.53),   1/mdyn  1/m,

this expression is related to the denition of gr  g2
y given in [94], and it is clear
that the scaling inequalities (3.65) imply that g2
y  0 when   . thus, only
if the hyperscaling relations are satised, a nonzero gy might be realized in the
continuum limit (  ), thereby giving rise to a nontrivial interacting theory.

thus   0 for   , which is referred to as the compositeness condition. due
to the chiral wti,  of eq. (2.74) scales, close to criticality, in the same manner
as , i.e.   . then, with eq. (2.76) and eq. (1.42), we obtain that

f  /2/ = 1(42)/2,

dynamical chiral symmetry breaking

and thus eq. (3.68) agrees with eq. (3.67). moreover eq. (3.70) implies the existence
of a scaling form for 5(q2) of eq. (2.65),

5(q2)  (m2

/2)f (q2/m2
),

(3.71)

where the critical exponent  should satisfy  = /2  /2, and f is assumed to
be nite at q2 = 0.
although the violations of the scaling laws for both fermions and magnets (fun-
damental scalars) is given by the inequalities (3.65), it is said [94] that the triviality
of fermions and magnets are realized in a dierent manner. for instance, the loga-
rithmic corrections to the critical exponent  have opposite sign; for fermions  < 3
and for magnets  > 3.

the important dierence is that the ng-bosons (pions etc) are composites of
fermions, whereas the ng-bosons are fundamental in scalar elds theory. this issue
is at the basis of determining whether the higgs boson is a fundamental scalar
eld or some fermion composite.

if one takes the limit of 0  c,  vanishes, and the critical exponents  and
 blow up. this can also be seen from the scaling law (3.42) which cannot be
expressed as a power-law dependence eq. (3.53). the phase transition at 0 = c
is rather special and we will discuss it more extensively in the next section.

3.6 the conformal phase transition

in the previous section we found that the critical exponents satisfy hyperscaling
relations in the intermediate region 0 < 0 < c. moreover, the cornwall-jackiw-
tomboulis (cjt)4 eective potential v of the gnjl model in the intermediate
region has been obtained by [24, 96, 97, 98, 39], and it can be shown that the eec-
tive potential for this range of gauge coupling constant is analogous to themexican
hat potential of the -model (the prototype potential for second-order phase tran-
sitions). however the phase transition at 0 = c cannot be described by a -model
type of eective potential. although the chiral phase transition is continuous (not
rst order) it cannot be classied as a second order (or higher) phase transition
([99, 27]). the phase transition at 0 = c is an example of a conformal phase
transition (cpt).

the concept of the cpt was introduced and discussed in ref. [27]. it embodies
the classication of specic types of phase transitions. the main feature of the cpt
is an abrupt change of the spectrum of light excitations (composites)5 as the critical
point is crossed, though the phase transition itself is continuous. this is connected
with the nonperturbative breakdown of the conformal symmetry (scale invariance)

4see ref. [95].
5by light excitations we mean excitations which have a small mass m compared with the cuto

, |m|/  1. in other words, the correlation lengths are large.

3.6 the conformal phase transition

75

by marginal operators (e.g., ( )2 + ( i5)2 in the gnjl model), which was
illustrated in ref. [27] by a study of the eective potentials in gross-neveu and
gnjl models.

the concept of the cpt can be considered as an extension of the berezinsky
kosterlitzthouless (bkt) [25, 26] phase transition (taking place in two dimen-
sions) to higher dimensions. witten [100] has shown that the phase transition in the
grossneveu model6 in d = 2 is analogous to the bkt phase transition. although
due to the merminwagner theorem [101, 102] spontaneous symmetry breaking or
long range order is not possible in d = 2, there is a generation of a fermion mass and
almost long range order. the correlations below the critical temperature in the
bkt type of models decrease with a (non-universal) power-law behavior instead of
exponentially, hence there is a phase transition though the ground state is unique.
instead of a genuine ng-boson a bkt gapless mode appears. the correlation length
  1/m in the grossneveu model and in the models with bkt phase transition
have a scaling law with essential singularity, similar to that of eq. (3.45). this is
the crucial property of the cpt; the presence of an essential singularity in the mass
(energy) gap at the critical point.

in theories with chiral symmetry breaking in d > 2, the particle-spectrum con-
sists of massless ng-bosons (), their chiral partners ( bosons), and light7 fermions
(and massless gauge bosons) in the chiral symmetry broken phase. in case of a -
model like phase transition, the particle spectrum would contain amongst massless
fermions (and massless gauge bosons), also light  and  resonances8 in the symmet-
ric phase. in case of the cpt, the spectrum in the symmetric phase only consists
of massless fermions; light fermion-anti-fermion states are absent.

the absolute value of the mass m of the  boson is analogous to the inverse
correlation length 1/, and the  boson plays the role of the nambugoldstone-
boson. in the symmetric phase, the  and  bosons are degenerate, (i.e., m = m).
from the pcac relations (see section 2.2.3) it follows that the  boson mass m
vanishes in the non-symmetric phase (with zero bare mass m0 = 0). thus we write,
around a critical point z = zc,

m = 0,
m = m,

m/ = c+(z)(z  zc),
m/ = c(z)(zc  z),

z  zc broken phase,
z < zc

(3.72)
symmetric phase, (3.73)

where z is a generic notation for the parameters of the theory, e.g. the coupling
constant 0 or g0, the number of fermion avors n or temperature t . moreover
the factors c+(z) and c(z) are functions of such parameters. furthermore c+ is
real (stable bound states) and c is complex valued (resonances). since in general

zzc |c+(z)| 6= lim
lim

zzc |c(z)|,

(3.74)

6the gross-neveu model or the thirring model can be consider as the njl model in two

dimensions with n fermion avors, see [67].

7by light particles we mean particles with masses much less than the cuto .
8the  and  bosons can decay to massless fermions and anti-fermions.

76

dynamical chiral symmetry breaking

the mass m, although continuous, is nonanalytic in z = zc. the explanation
(see [27]) is that while in the symmetric phase, the  and  bosons are described
by bs equations with a zero fermion mass, in the non-symmetric phase they are
described by bs equations with mdyn 6= 0. because of that, bs equations in the
non-symmetric phase are not obtained by an analytic continuation of the equations
in the symmetric phase. again, this is reection of the fact that a phase transition
is described by non-analytic behavior in one (or more) of the parameters of the
generating functional. consequently the green functions (or at least some of them)
exhibit non-analyticity around the critical point.

it is clear from eqs. (3.72) and (3.73) that close to criticality, i.e. z  zc, the
spectrum comprises of light bound states, |m|,|m|  . moreover, the fermion
dynamical mass mdyn, which is given via the order parameter m  h i, vanishes
in the symmetric phase. in the non-symmetric phase, the pcac relations show that
mdyn scales in the same way as m. we recall that, in the chiral limit (m0  0),
we have the scaling laws

mdyn  m, m  (z  zc),
mdyn = 0, m = 0,

z < zc

z  zc broken phase,
symmetric phase.

(3.75)
(3.76)

for models with d > 2. thus close to criticality we can represent the mass spectrum
of excitations by a universal scaling function f

mdyn, m, m  f (z),

(3.77)

around z = zc. if the scaling function f is of the form f (z)  |z zc| , the spectrum
consists of light excitations on both sides of the critical point.
the cpt is characterized by a scaling function f (z) which has an essential

singularity at z = zc and satises

(3.78)

(3.79)

the scaling law at 0 = c of mdyn in the gnjl model, see eq. (3.45), is an
example of a scaling law with such an essential singularity. let us follow [27],
and argue that the scaling law with essential singularity implies an abrupt change
in the spectrum consisting of light excitations. the story is as follows.
in the
nonsymmetric phase, besides the solutions with mdyn 6= 0, there are solutions with
mdyn = 0, which can be obtained by analytically continuing the solutions in the
symmetric phase to the nonsymmetric phase. the solutions with mdyn = 0 in
the broken phase are unstable or unphysical, in that case the  and  bosons are
tachyons: m2
it is shown in [3] that scaling law for the
tachyonic masses has the same form as the scaling law for the dynamical fermion
|mdyn|  |mtach|. the crucial point is that the
mass mdyn in the broken phase:

tach  m2

 = m2

 < 0.

3.6 the conformal phase transition

77

replacement of mdyn 6= 0 by mdyn = 0 does not change the ultraviolet properties of
the theory. the analytic continuation of the scaling law for m eq. (3.73) from the
symmetric phase (z < zc) to the broken phase (z > zc) gives the scaling law for the
tachyonic mass

m/ = c(z)(zc  z)  f (z),
mtach/ = c(z)(zc  z)  f (z),

z < zc,
z > zc,

(3.80)
(3.81)

where m2
tach < 0, mdyn  |mtach| = |m|. since the scaling law f (z) of the -model
type approaches zero from both sides of the critical point zc, it follows straightfor-
wardly that the spectrum comprises of light excitations (|m| = |m|  ) in the
symmetric phase. however in case of the cpt, when f (z) has an essential singu-
larity (eq. (3.79)) f (z) does not approach zero from the symmetric side and the
mass of the  and  resonances will not be small (m/  o(1)). thus the cpt
is characterized by an abrupt change in the spectrum of light excitations across the
critical point z = zc.

what is the origin of the cpt? in case of the gnjl model with nonzero g0 and
0 < c the model contains formally irrelevant four-fermion operators d( )2 > 4
which become relevant operators d( )2 < 4 near the critical curve due to the ap-
pearance of a large anomalous dimension for these operators. the relevant operators
break the conformal symmetry (scale invariance) explicitly in the symmetric phase
(close to criticality), and give rise to light  and  resonances (which introduce a
conformal symmetry breaking mass-scale into the theory). however at 0 = c
and g0 < 1/4 the four-fermion operators are marginal operators, and the theory
is supposedly conformal invariant. therefore in the symmetric phase it is consis-
tent that we would expect only massless fermions and anti-fermions, and absence
of light unstable  and  bound states. in the symmetric phase the divergence of
the dilatation current d (see [6, 3] for exact denitions) vanishes, i.e., d = 0.
however dynamical breaking of the chiral symmetry introduces a new mass-scale,
and introduces a conformal anomaly (d 6= 0)9. hence, the origin of the cpt
lies in the nonperturbative breakdown of conformal invariance.
up till now, the cpt has been found in 2-dimensional gross-neveu model [100,
27], the gnjl model and quenched qed4 at 0 = c, see for instance [11, 104].
more recently, the cpt was considered in su (nc) gauge theories (with nc the
number of colors) with n number of avors [105, 106] by concluding the absence of
light excitations in the symmetric phase. in qed3 without chern-simons term a
cpt like transition was found by [99] and [107], where appelquist et al. considered
the spectrum of excitations, and gusynin et al. constructed the (cjt) eective
potential. we will return to the concept of the cpt, when we discuss the propagator
of the  boson in section 4.6.

9it is said ([27]) that the specic form of the conformal anomaly implies a realization of the

partial conservation of dilation current (pcdc) hypothesis, see for instance [103].

78

dynamical chiral symmetry breaking

3.7 rg equations and ne-tuning

as was discussed in section 1.3, the concept of ne-tuning of relevant and marginal
interactions is required for determining whether a nontrivial continuum limit exists.
according to the renormalization group methods the bare couplings of a quantum
eld model run with the uv cuto . referring to subsection 1.3.3, we recall that
the bare relevant and marginal couplings (e.g. m0, 0, g0) have to be ne-tuned
suciently close to the critical point in order for scaling behavior to set in.

near the critical point a new scale is generated, namely the correlation length
which exist in case of for instance the -model type of phase transition on both sides
(both phases) of the system. in the broken phase the inverse correlation length is
real and can be considered as a physical mass of particles, for instance the mass
of the scalar bound state (the  boson) m, or the mass of fermion mdyn, whereas
in the symmetric phase the correlation length is complex giving rise to resonances
(scalar and pseudoscalar resonances), given by a mass and a width. it turns out
that if hyperscaling relations are satised the absolute value of the mass of the
resonance can be considered as the inverse correlation length, and the mass over
width ratio (i.e., the complex phase) will only depend on the critical exponents. in
case of a cpt there are no resonances in the symmetric phase, and no new mass
scale is introduced, hence there is absence of ne-tuning.

the ne-tuning depends on the eigenvalues of the couplings close to the critical
point (see eq. (1.84) and hence on the critical exponents (see eq. (1.86)). these
critical exponents follow in principle from the  functions for the coupling param-
eters 0, g0 and 0, which are dened by





d0

d

= (0, g0, 0),

= g(0, g0, 0),

= (0, g0, 0),

where 0 is the dimensionless bare mass

0 = m0/.

(3.82)

(3.83)

(3.84)

(3.85)

the rst step is determine the xed points (, g, ) of the rg equations (3.82),
(3.83), and (3.84), i.e.

(, g, ) = 0,

g(, g, ) = 0,

(, g, ) = 0.

(3.86)

in principle these rg equations follow from the regularized sdes derived in chap-
ter 2. as is well-known, the xed point for  is  = 0, hence we can write



d0
d   (1 + m) 0,

(3.87)

3.7 rg equations and ne-tuning

79

where m is the anomalous dimension of the mass operator  evaluated at the xed
point (, g, ), see again subsection 1.3.3. equation (3.87) is in correspondence
with eqs. (1.98) and (1.100), since the canonical dimension of  is dc = 3 at d = 4.
the critical exponent  (see eq. (1.100)) of 0 is negative (for m > 1), thus the
dimensionless bare mass  is a relevant coupling, and requires ne-tuning.
after setting 0 =  = 0, the problem reduces to the determination of the uv

xed points for the subset

g(g0, 0) = 0,
(g0, 0) = 0,

(3.88)

(3.89)

of the  functions. the quenched ladder approximation simplies the solutions
of eqs. (3.88), and (3.89) considerably since the quenched hypothesis eq. (3.1)
explicitly sets  = 0. in this way, as we will show in a moment, the critical xed
point of eq. (3.88) is given by eq. (3.46):

g = gc(0),

g(gc(0), 0) = 0.

(3.90)

therefore we can address the problem of nding critical xed points beyond the
quenched approximation as was proposed at the end of subsection 1.3.2. thus the
analysis of solutions (g, ) of eqs. (3.88) and (3.89) is performed by rst assuming
that a solution of

g(g0, 0) = 0

(3.91)

exists and can be expressed as g = gc(0). then the equation (3.89) should be
reconsidered. in chapter 5 the equation (3.89) will be analyzed beyond the quenched
approximation, and we will indeed try to solve

(gc(0), 0) = 0.

(3.92)

in what follows, we derive the expression for the anomalous dimension m of 

and nd an expression for the  function, g, of g0.

3.7.1 rg ow in the broken phase

in the broken phase the mass of the scalar m scales in the same way as the
dynamical fermion mass. hence we assume that in the chiral limit (m0  0)
the dynamical mass mdyn  0 is related to some physical mass scale and thus
independent of the uv cuto . the dynamical mass is given by the scaling law
(3.41), so we assume that



dmdyn

d

= 0.

(3.93)

80

dynamical chiral symmetry breaking

since in the broken phase mdyn 6= 0, we get

dmdyn

d



g(g0, 0)

2g0(g0 + )(cid:21) ,

(3.94)

where the -function of g0 is dened in eq. (3.83). the left-hand side is zero, so
this gives the following condition for the -function in the broken phase (g0 > 0):

g(g0, 0) = 2g0(g0 + ).

(3.95)

an additional ne-tuning condition is that the bare mass m0 is supposed to be
much smaller than the dynamically generated mass mdyn,

m0  mdyn  0  .

(3.96)

an expression for the anomalous dimension m of the mass operator  which
is dened in eq. (3.87), can be obtained by dierentiating eq. (3.29) with respect
to  and assuming the ne-tuning condition (3.96). we obtain

(3.97)

using now the equation for the -function eq. (3.95) we get, for the anomalous
dimension in the broken phase,

m = 1 +  + 2g0,

(3.98)

near the critical curve.

3.7.2 rg ow in the symmetric phase

in the symmetric phase (g0 < 0), the only scale besides the uv cuto and the
bare mass m0 is the scale set by the mass and width of the scalar and pseudoscalar

resonances, i.e.
the mass and the width of the scalar and pseudoscalar resonances (analogous of
the correlation length in the symmetric phase) should be considered as the physical
mass scales which in principle can be obtained from experiment. we set   |m|.
the ne-tuning condition or rg ow of the bare four-fermion coupling g0 in the
symmetric phase is obtained from the condition

where  is some infrared renormalization scale related to m (by denition inde-
pendent of ). we assume also that the scale of the bare mass is much smaller than
the physical infrared scale , thus in the chiral limit,   m0. at the moment the
ne-tuning condition seems a bit arbitrary, however in the next chapter when we
explicitly renormalize the scalar propagator in the symmetric phase, the ne-tuning
condition (3.99) turns out to be quite natural.

the expression for m in the broken phase were rstly obtained by miransky and
yamawaki [21]. later it was shown by kikukawa and yamawaki [108] in d < 4
dimensional njl models and by kondo et al. [39] that the anomalous dimension
is continuous (but in fact non-analytic) across the critical curve, by identifying the
ne tuning of g0.

3.8 lattice simulations of strong coupling qed

lattice simulations of strong coupling qed and the gnjl models are usually per-
formed in the noncompact formulation, (i.e., the gauge elds are noncompact). in
such a formulation the pure gauge sector is free of topological excitations. the
main reason for using the noncompact formulation of the gauge group is the obser-
vation that it appears to have a second order chiral phase transition [38], whereas
the compact formulation exhibits a rst order chiral phase transition [109]. the
latter, therefore, is not a realistic candidate for a relativistic continuum quantum
eld theory.

82

dynamical chiral symmetry breaking

the scaling law with essential singularity (miransky scaling) at the critical cou-
pling 0 = c has been studied by kogut et al. [110, 111]. however later simula-
tions questioned the existence of miransky scaling on the lattice, see for instance
the discussion in [23] and [92].

early studies of strong qed with four-fermion coupling on the lattice were done
by [23, 112]. the conclusions of [23] are in agreement with [24]; the critical expo-
nents have nonmean eld values and satisfy hyperscaling in the intermediate region
(0 < 0 < c) (in quenched approximation). furthermore it was argued in [23]
that from the rg point of view it is essential that the critical exponent  = 1. it
means one has the factorization ( )2 = 2( ). hence the anomalous dimension
of the operator ( )2 is twice the anomalous dimension of the mass operator .
a renormalization of the chiral condensate simultaneously renormalizes the prop-
agators s and p.
indeed the lattice computations of the critical exponent 
reported in [23, 112] showed strong evidence for  = 1.

moreover is was argued that it is natural for the lattice-regulated form of qed
to incorporate four-fermion interactions. the illinois group ([23, 112]) obtained a
critical point (0.44c, 0.76) in the (0, g0) plane, which ts nicely on the critical
line eq. (3.46). however it was not possible at that time to investigate with lattice
simulations the phase transition along the critical line.

later, the gnjl model was studied on the lattice in noncompact formulation
[92]. they
using some mean eld approach for the fermions, by azcoiti et al.
obtained a critical line qualitatively similar to the sde approach eq. (3.46), and
nonmean eld critical exponents.

studies of the compact gnjl model [113] (with torus topology) showed to have
both a rst order transition as well a second oder phase transition similar to the
continuous transition in the noncompact formulation [92, 113]. also in these studies
([92]) it was shown that the critical exponents have nonmean eld values and satisfy
hyperscaling.

simulations of noncompact full (unquenched) qed on the lattice (with avors,
n = 2 and n = 4) are controversial [114]. the illinois group [115, 116] (see also
[117, 118]) and the zaragosa group [119, 120], nd power-law scaling and nonmean
eld critical exponents, signaling a possible nontrivial continuum limit for the strong
coupling broken phase, whereas [121, 122, 114] obtain mean eld behavior (mean
eld critical exponents with logarithmic corrections). thus gockeler et al. nd a
vanishing renormalized gauge coupling and a vanishing eective yukawa coupling
(dened by the goldbergertreiman relation), and they conclude that lattice qed
is trivial, see for their most recent result ref. [123].

the authors of [124, 115, 116] found indications that monopole condensation and
chiral symmetry transitions were coincident. these results suggested that theories
of fundamental charges and monopoles provide a natural scenario for nontrivial
ultraviolet behavior. however later analysis of [125] and the discussion in [126] put
in doubt the initial ideas on the role of monopole condensation driving the chiral

3.9 beyond the ladder approximation

83

phase transition.

in [94] it was argued that the triviality of 4 theory cannot be a good guide
to understanding the possible triviality of the pure njl or spinor qed. the main
reason is that the nambu-goldstone bosons in models with fundamental fermions
which undergo (dynamical) chiral symmetry breaking are composite, and their prop-
agators have a large anomalous dimension, whereas they are fundamental in theories
with scalars that exhibit a magnetic type of phase transition, and the anomalous
dimension is small. the consequence is the following. although both the njl
model and 4 theory violate hyperscaling due to the appearance of logarithmic
corrections, and hence are trivial, the bounds on the critical exponents are dier-
ent. in njl type of models the logarithmic violations reduce the critical exponent
 below its mean eld value  < 3, whereas in scalar models the critical exponent
exceeds its mean eld value  > 3. such logarithmic violations10 of scaling and the
direction of violation were tested in [127], and [128].

studies of unquenched qed or gnjl model in the continuum (both analytic
and numerical studies), see refs. [129, 130, 131], commonly use a one-loop vacuum
polarization in the sde for the fermion propagator and gap equation. the eect of
the inclusion of screening eects on the phase transition is that instead of the scaling
law with essential singularity, the scaling appears to be of the mean eld type,
as one would expected for a trivial theory (with a one-loop vacuum polarization
incorporated qed is shown to be explicitly trivial).

3.9 beyond the ladder approximation

in the previous section we have pointed out the qualitative agreement of the sd
quenched-ladder approximation with the quenched lattice simulations. but we
would like to mention other attempts to study the gap equation beyond the ladder
approximation in framework of the sd approach. in refs.[132, 133] the validity of
the ladder approximation is analyzed by including the eects of e.g. crossed photon
exchange graphs. moreover, holdom [133] gives strong arguments that the scaling
law for the fermion dynamical mass mdyn in the quenched theory (including also
crossed photon graphs, and vertex corrections) is of the same form as the scaling law
obtained in the quenched-ladder approximation given by eq. (3.45). this is analo-
gous to the statement that the anomalous dimension is one (m = 1) in quenched
qed.

in addition, the nonperturbative renormalization group methods (nprg) of
refs. [41, 132] provide a way to check the quenched-ladder approximation in the
gnjl model by including the eect of crossed photon exchange graphs, and four-
fermion interactions in the rg ow of coupling constants. the basic principle
of the nprg methods is to write down the equation for the so-called shell-mode

10logarithmic scaling is rather complicated to investigate on the lattice due to the niteness of

the system.

84

dynamical chiral symmetry breaking

eective action, which follows from varying the cuto of the wilsonian eective
action, see e.g. eq. (1.55). in principle the nprg method is exact, but unsolvable
in practice, since it involves the computation of the rg ows of an innite set
of operators and couplings. the systematic approximation is to write down the
nprg equations for a suitable nite set of local operators, which is called the local
potential approximation (lpa). the next step is that the solutions obtained in
the lpa have to be checked for stability with respect to enlargement of the set of
operators.

in ref. [134] the critical line in the full quenched gnjl model is obtained in
a particular lpa, which incorporates besides crossed photon exchange graphs also
four-fermion exchanges beyond the mean eld approach. the equation for the
critical line obtained by aoki et al. reads

gc(0) =

1

3(cid:18)1 +r1 

0

c(cid:19)2

,

(3.105)

and in comparison with eq. (3.46) the dierence is just an overall factor 3/4. thus
these studies support the reliability of the ladder approximation. moreover in
ref. [134] it is shown that the critical exponents agree rather well with the quenched-
ladder results for small values of 0. however, for values of the gauge coupling 0
close to the cpt point 0 = c, a small quantitative dierence in the values of the
critical exponents emerges.

let us mention some other attempts to study dsb in quenched qed beyond
the ladder approximation. in refs. [135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 140] various ansatze for
the photon-fermion vertex have been constructed and analyzed. the main motiva-
tion for the construction of such ansatze is the formulation of a gauge independent
approach to dsb. in the ladder approximation the full photon-fermion vertex is
approximated by the bare vertex and the approximation is believed to be reliable
only in landau gauge  = 0. since, there, the gauge-dependent anomalous dimen-
sion of the fermion wave function z (eq. (2.24)) vanishes, and z = 1. consequently
the wti for the photon-fermion vertex, eq. (2.50), is satised asymptotically, i.e.
for momenta |p|  |mdyn|. two crucial constraints on the vertex ansatze are the
wti and power-law behavior for the fermion wave function. the power-law be-
havior for z is motivated and derived from the multiplicative renormalizability of
perturbation theory for arbitrary gauge-parameters .

scalar composites in the
symmetric phase

4.1

introduction

in the ladder approximation, and using the hartree-fock (mean eld) approxima-
tion for the four-fermion coupling it has been shown [96, 97, 104, 39] that the
gnjl model in four dimensions is indeed renormalizable, and that the anomalous
dimension of  is large, turning the formally irrelevant four-fermion operators
into relevant operators. fine-tuning the coupling g0 to gc in ssb phase in such
a way that md/  1, where md  (0) is the dynamical mass of a fermion, a
nontrivial continuum limit (md/  0) can be reached just as in pure quenched
qed [87, 10, 11, 89]. the spectrum of such a theory contains pseudoscalar () and
scalar () bound states which become light and dynamically active in the vicinity of
the critical line. since the phase transition is second order along the part eq. (3.46)
of the critical curve, scalar and pseudoscalar resonances have been shown to be
produced on the symmetric side of the curve, whose masses approach zero as the
critical curve is approached [22]. the resonances are of the breit-wigner type (see
section 2.3) and described by a complex pole (on a second riemann sheet) in their
respective propagators.

the part of the critical curve, eq. (3.47), with 0 = c is rather special. for
example, an abrupt change of the spectrum of light excitations occurs when the line
0 = c, g0 < 1/4 is crossed: while light scalar and pseudoscalar excitations still
persist in the broken phase, there are no such light excitations in the symmetric
phase [104, 105]. a similar behavior has been revealed also in qed3 [99]. this
peculiar phase transition was referred to as a conformal phase transition (cpt)
[27].

in this chapter we study scalar composites ( and  bosons) in the symmetric

phase of the gnjl model. computing the scalar propagator, see eqs. (2.25)
(2.26) and fig. 4.1, requires knowledge of the full scalar-fermion-antifermion vertex
s(p + q, p) (the yukawa vertex) which in turn satises the bethe-salpeter (bs)
equation 2.40 and is displayed in fig. 4.2. we solve this bs equation in the ladder
approximation (fig. 4.3) but dier from the corresponding studies in refs. [39,
22] who used an approximation for s(p + q, p) with zero boson momentum (q =
0). a technique of expansion in chebyshev polynomials is introduced for solving
the yukawa vertex with nonzero boson momentum and consequently an explicit
analytical expression is derived for the propagator of the  boson valid along the
entire critical curve. our main physical conclusions are the same as in refs. [104, 22,
105]: in the region 0 < c, g0 > 1/4, in the symmetric phase, a spectrum of light
resonances exists while at 0 < c, g0 < 1/4 there are no light resonances. having

obtained an analytical expression for the scalar propagator, we can analytically
continue it into the region 0 > c and nd light tachyons there, signaling the
instability of the symmetric solution.

the plan of the present chapter is as follows. first we solve the equation for the
yukawa vertex with nonzero boson momentum in section 4.2 keeping only the zero
order chebyshev harmonics. in section 4.3 we obtain an analytical expression for
the  boson propagator valid along the entire critical line and analyze its behavior in
dierent asymptotical regimes. section 4.4 is devoted to comparing our results for
the yukawa vertex and boson propagator with the corresponding ones in refs. [39,
22]. in section 4.5 we discuss the behavior of the scalar propagator near the critical
line (3.46) in the symmetric phase and, in particular, the mass and the width of
resonances. the analysis of the scalar composites near the critical line (3.47) is given
in section 4.6, where we show the absence of light excitations at 0  c while
analytically continuing the symmetric phase propagator into the region 0  c
leads to the appearance of tachyonic states. we discuss this behavior from the
viewpoint of the cpt conception proposed in ref. [27] and section 4.6. a summary
is given in section 4.8 and in appendix d we give an analysis of the contribution
of higher order chebyshev harmonics into the yukawa vertex equation and scalar
vacuum polarization. the results of this chapter were published in ref. [40].

4.2 scalar vertex in quenched-ladder approxima-

tion

in this section we discuss the sdes for the scalar propagator and the scalar vertex
in the well-known quenched-ladder approximation and introduce an approximation
scheme for solving the sde for the scalar vertex. for the time being we consider
one avor of fermions, n = 1. then the sde for  boson reads

1
s (p) = 

1
g0

+ s(p2),

where the scalar vacuum polarization s(q2) is given by

s(p2) = iz

d4k
(2)4 tr [s(k + p)s(k + p, k)s(k)] ,

and for the yukawa vertex s we have

scalar composites in the symmetric phase

(see fig. 4.2), and where  is the uv cuto. we recall that in the symmetric phase
of the gnjl the pseudoscalar and scalar propagators are degenerate, so are the
pseudoscalar vertex and scalar vertex.

the ladder approximation is obtained by replacing the bethe-salpeter kernel

k (2) of eq. (b.28) by the one photon exchange graph,

(ie2

0)k (2)

ab,cd(k, p, p + q) = (ie0)

(4.4)

furthermore the photon propagator is considered as quenched, i.e., vacuum polar-
ization eects are turned o, and thus the gauge coupling does not run (as explained
earlier), we again assume

(0)  0.

(4.5)

in principle the bethe-salpeter kernel also contains scalar and pseudoscalar ex-
changes. one question is whether such exchanges can be neglected, this question
will be addressed in the next chapter. the answer not only depends on the short-
distance behavior of the full scalar propagators and yukawa vertex which we will try
to solve in this chapter, but also on the representation of the chiral symmetry. in
the next chapter we will argue that, provided scalars and pseudoscalars are consid-
ered both in the adjoint representation of the chiral symmetry, the neglect of scalar
and pseudoscalar exchanges in the kernel k (2) seems reasonable for the sde for the
yukawa vertices s and p. hence we will treat the four-fermion interactions again
in the hartreefock approximation, a sort of mean eld approach, and postpone
discussions of validity and self-consistence to the chapter 5.

the sde equation for the scalar vertex in the ladder approximation can be

written as

s(p + q, p) = 1 + ie2

d4r
(2)4

0z

 s(r + q)s(r + q, r)s(r) d(r  p)

(4.6)

(see fig. 4.3). the sde for the scalar propagator, eq. (4.2), is left unchanged.
in the symmetric phase, the equation for the scalar vertex, eq. (4.6), is a self-
contained equation, if we note that in the landau gauge the fermion propagator is
s(p) = 1/p. we recall that in the landau gauge the ladder approximation respects
the chiral and vector ward-takahashi identities. the sdes in ladder approximation
for scalar propagator and vertex, eqs. (4.2) and (4.6), have been studied extensively
in the literature [39, 22, 141, 142, 98], but mainly for the case of zero-transfer boson
momentum (q = 0).

in what follows, we present a method for solving the scalar vertex with nonzero
boson momentum. the starting point is a general structure of the scalar vertex and
pseudoscalar vertex. the scalar and pseudoscalar vertices in momentum space can
be decomposed over four spinor structures with dimensionless scalar functions as

4.2 scalar vertex in quenched-ladder approximation

89

vertex functions coincide, i.e., we set fi  f (s)

given in eqs. (2.42) and (2.43). in the symmetric phase, the scalar and pseudoscalar
, i = 1, 2. the straightfor-
ward consequence is that the scalar and pseudoscalar propagators are also identical
(degenerate) in the symmetric phase, just a reection of the chiral symmetry. thus
we have the structure

i = f (p)

i

s(p + q, p) = 1 [f1 + (q p  pq) f2 + (p + q)f3 + pf4] .

(4.7)

furthermore, because of the absence of a dynamical mass in the symmetric phase,
the equations for the scalar functions f3 and f4 decouple from the equations for f1
and f2. moreover, f3 and f4 do not contribute in scalar and pseudoscalar vacuum
polarizations. in fact the integral equations for these functions are homogeneous
ones and in the symmetric phase we can always take the solution f3 = f4 = 0
which is a consistent one.

so the problem is reduced to solving a coupled set of integral equations for two
scalar functions f1, f2, which has the form (after making a standard wick rotation

and r dr denotes the usual angular part of the four-dimensional integration.
the sde for yukawa vertex is quite similar to a bethe-salpeter equation (bse)
for bound state wave function  (  sss). the essential dierence of course is
that the sde for s is an inhomogeneous equation, whereas the homogeneous bse
describing bound states is an eigenvalue equation.

90

scalar composites in the symmetric phase

the equations (4.8) are still very complicated due to the fact that the angular
part of the integration cannot be performed in explicit form, since the angular
dependence of the yukawa vertex is unknown. without any further approximations
it seems impossible to solve the equations analytically. our primary interest is the
scalar propagator dened by the vacuum polarization eq. (4.2). the equation for
the scalar vacuum polarization is

fn(p2, q2) and gn(p2, q2). the important thing is that only the harmonics f0 con-
tains an inhomogeneous term in the equation for it (the constant 1 in eq. (4.8)),
while other harmonics can be found iteratively once f0 is computed. in other words,
for the vertex function f1 the scale is set by the bare vertex, i.e., such a function
has nonhomogeneous ultraviolet boundary conditions. for the vertex function f2
there is no such inhomogeneous term other than given indirectly by the coupling to
vertex function f1.

we assume that the scalar vertex function f1(p + q, p) depends only weakly on
the angle between fermion and scalar-boson momentum pq, so that an innite set of
equations for fn and gn is replaced by the equation for the zeroth-order chebyshev
coecient function f0 which we shall solve exactly. the main approximation is to
replace the yukawa vertex by the angular average of the vertex function f1,

s(p + q, p)  1z dp

22 f1(p + q, p) = 1f0(p2, q2),

(4.22)

since chebyshev polynomials of the second kind are precisely orthogonal with re-
spect to such integration. then we write

f0(p2, q2)  fir(p2, q2)(q2  p2) + fuv(p2, q2)(p2  q2).

(4.23)

the functions fir and fuv are respectively referred to as the ir channel (infrared),
and the uv channel (ultraviolet).

if the scalar vertex indeed weakly depends on angle between scalar-boson and
fermion momentum p owing through the yukawa vertex, these channel functions
should have the limits

lim
p2q2

s(p + q, p) = 1 lim
p2q2

lim
q2p2

s(p + q, p) = 1 lim
q2p2

fuv(p2, q2),

fir(p2, q2),

(4.24)

(4.25)

i.e., the asymptotics of the scalar vertex are independent of the angle between p
and q. hence the uv channel contains a limit of the yukawa vertex with the boson
momentum q that is much smaller than both fermion momenta (q  p), and the ir
channel contains a limit of the vertex with the fermion momentum p that is much
smaller than the boson momentum (q  p). the connection between the yukawa
vertex s and these two channel functions is illustrated in fig. 4.4.
the expansion in chebyshev polynomials is discussed in detail in appendix d.
moreover, the error, due to our approximation, eq. (4.22), in the computation of
the scalar vacuum polarization, is estimated in that appendix.

the dierential equations can be solved straightforwardly. the equation for fir
can be written as a bessel equation, and the equation for fuv as a modied bessel
equation (see ref. [144] for mathematical details). the general solutions of the
dierential equations are

fir(s, t) = c3(t/2, )(cid:18) t
+ c4(t/2, )(cid:18) t

that since eqs. (4.34), (4.35) are scale invariant their solutions are functions of the
ratio s/t and the scale invariance is violated by the uv boundary condition (4.36)
only.

the irbc for the ir channel requires c4(t/2, ) = 0, since the bessel function

(4.56)

and  is the euler gamma. the expression (4.55) is of the same form as obtained
in ref. [39] (their formula (2.88)).

4.3 analytic structure of the scalar propagator

in the previous section we obtained an analytical expression for the scalar vertex by
assuming that the vertex only weakly depends on the angle between boson momen-
tum and fermion momentum. the expression for the scalar vacuum polarization
in such an approximation takes the form of eq. (4.32). the main object of inves-
tigation is scalar compositeness near the critical line. in the neighborhood of the
critical line, the tendency of fermion-antifermion pairs to form bound states under
the inuence of strong attractive four-fermion forces becomes apparent.

since we are in the symmetric phase of the gnjl model (there is no dynami-
cal mass), the only important variable is the scalar boson momentum over cuto
t = q2/2. equation (4.32) shows that the vacuum polarization depends only on
the uv channel with fermion momentum at 2, eq. (4.33). substituting the ex-
pressions obtained for the vertex function eq. (4.39) in the equation for the vacuum
polarization eq. (4.33), we obtain

s(q2) =

2
42

1

0 (cid:20) ()h(q2/2,)  ()h(q2/2, )
()g(q2/2,)  ()g(q2/2, )(cid:21) ,

where  and g are given by eqs. (4.44) and (4.45), and where

2 ! +r 20q2

(4.57)

(4.58)

this expression is valid along the entire critical curve in the symmetric phase.
note that the vacuum polarization is symmetric in  which means that we can
analytically continue it to values 0 > c.

equation (4.57) is a rather complicated expression, and we will rst investigate

some specic limits:

4.3 analytic structure of the scalar propagator

97

(a) the pure njl limit, where the gauge interaction is turned o, i.e., the case

where 0 = 0, thus  = 1.

(b) asymptotic behavior of s, the infrared behavior q2/2  1 in such a manner,

so that (q2/2)  q2/2.

(c) the behavior at the critical gauge coupling 0 = c, thus  = 0.

(d) the behavior of s for 0 > c,  = i,  = p0/c  1, i.e., analytic

continuation across the critical curve at 0 = c.

4.3.1 the pure njl limit

the pure nambujona-lasinio limit is the case where the gauge interaction is com-
pletely turned o, possible bound states in such a model are purely due to the
four-fermion interaction. so 0  0, and therefore   1. the scalar vertex at
0 = 0 is just equal to the bare vertex, s = 1 = fuv = fir. the pure njl
limit can be correctly obtained from eq. (4.57) by making expansions of the bessel
functions keeping sucient number of terms, and then performing an expansion in
(1  ) to zeroth order. hence with 0 = 0,  = 1 in eq. (4.57), we get

s(q2) =

2

42 (cid:20)1 +

q2

22 ln(cid:18) q2

2(cid:19) 

3q2

42(cid:21) .

(4.59)

the log term is a consequence of the hard fermion loop which also ruins the
renormalizability of the pure njl model.

4.3.2 asymptotic behavior of the  boson vacuum polariza-

tion

the asymptotic behavior 0 <  < 1 so that (q2/2)  q2/2 can be obtained by
considering rst the q2  2 limit of z, eq. (4.43):



2 sin ph()h()(1  2)(cid:18) q2

2(cid:19)1/2

in this limit, as

however, the above expression does not reproduce the correct leading term of the
njl limit (  1), for that we should use the expression (4.57). in order to obtain
such an expression which contains properly the pure njl limit, we have to keep
more terms in the expansion of z. we then get for the scalar vacuum polarization

for eq. (4.64) to be valid, it is assumed that  > 1/2. it is straightforward to check
that this expression satises the njl limit (  1).
this is a suitable point to refer to appendix d for an analysis of the reliability
of eq. (4.64), where it is shown that the leading and next-to-leading terms in q2/2
of s (i.e., the rst two terms on the right-hand side of eq. (4.64)) are indeed
correctly obtained by our approximation, see eq. (d.36).

4.3.3 the  boson at critical gauge coupling

at critical gauge coupling 0 = c ( = 0) is the onset of the scalar compositeness
originating purely from electromagnetic forces. the expression for fuv, eq. (4.51),
has the form at 0 = c

fuv(p2, q2) = 2(cid:18) p2

2(cid:19)1/2
2i0(x)  2xi1(x)  1k0(x)  1xk1(x)(cid:21) ,

2i0(y)  1k0(y)

 (cid:20)

where x =pq2/22 and y =pq2/2p2. this gives

s(q2) =

42 (cid:20)4 +

2i0(x)  2xi1(x)  1k0(x)  1xk1(x)(cid:21) .

4.4 comparison with earlier work

99

4.3.4 analytic continuation across the critical curve

since the expression for the scalar vacuum polarization is symmetric in , eq. (4.57),
it can be analytically continued to the values 0 > c. this holds in replacing 
by i in eq. (4.57), where

 =p0/c  1.

(4.68)

the four specic limits of the scalar vacuum polarization described above are
very useful for studying the resonance structure of the bound states which will be
done in section 4.5, and for the study of the cpt which will be done in section 4.6.
but rst we shall compare our result for s with that one obtained by other authors
in the next section.

4.4 comparison with earlier work

in this section we discuss the earlier work of appelquist, terning, and wijewardhana
[22] and related work based on that by kondo, tanabashi, and yamawaki [39] on
the scalar composites in the gnjl model. the method used by these authors
to solve the coupled set of scalar vertex and scalar vacuum polarization is the
following. they consider a taylor-series expansion about q = 0 of the scalar vacuum
polarization s(q2). in the ladder approximation, such a series has the property
that the nth derivative can be written as

q(cid:19)n

qm s(k + q, k)(cid:19)

(4.69)

their basic assumption is then that derivatives of the scalar vertex s can be
neglected with respect to s for small 0,

how does their result compare to ours? from our expression for the asymptotic
behavior of s, eq. (4.64), and the result obtained in refs. [22] and [39], eq. (4.72),
the leading power of momentum is the same, namely, (q2/2). however, the -
dependent factors in front of the leading and next-to-leading powers are dierent.
at the same time the pure njl limit is obtained correctly in refs. [22] and [39].
the dierences are rather small for values of  close to 1, i.e. the coecients are

a() = a(),

b() = b()(cid:2)1 + o((1  )2)(cid:3) .

(4.74)

hence the approach to the njl point  = 1 of both approximations is equal.
however, for smaller values of  the coecient b obtained in the present chapter
starts to deviate from the one obtained in ref. [22]. then for such values of ,
b() > b().

what is the origin of this dierence? the rst point is that the expression
derived in refs. [22] and [39] is valid for 0 not too large. secondly, from their
answer eq. (4.72) it is clear that a taylor series of the scalar propagator about q = 0
is not well dened due to the noninteger power behavior for values 0 <  < 1. this
is reected also in their assumption regarding the derivatives of the scalar vertex at
q = 0, eq. (4.70). the expression for the scalar vertex obtained in section 4.2 shows
that in general, for 0 <  < 1, the assumption (4.70) is not true. such derivatives
of s are singular at q = 0 due to the fact that they depend on noninteger powers
of q, which can be seen from eq. (4.39).

the scalar vertex for small q  p is of the form s(p + q, p)  fuv(p2, q2), and
fuv(p2, q2)  (cid:18) p2
 2(cid:18) q2

which is consistent with eq. (4.64) for p2 = 2, because of eq. (4.33). of course
at q = 0 our result coincides with that of the other authors. but for nonzero q this
expression clearly shows that for 0 <  < 1 the vertex contains noninteger powers
of q. hence the assumption made in refs. [39, 22] is not true in general, since higher
derivatives of the scalar vertex with respect to q are singular at q = 0.

4.5 light scalar resonances near criticality

in this section we discuss the behavior of the scalar propagator near the critical
line in the symmetric phase g0  gc. in the symmetric phase the scalar and pseu-
doscalar composites, the  and  bosons are degenerate. near the critical curve, a
combination of strong four-fermion coupling and gauge coupling will tend to bind
fermions and antifermions into these scalar composites. since the chiral symme-
try is unbroken the  and  bosons decay to massless fermions and antifermions.
hence the scalar composites are resonances which are described by a complex pole
in their propagators. the complex pole determines the mass and the width of the
resonances.

in what follows, we redo the computation of the complex poles of the  boson
which was performed by appelquist et al. in ref. [22] using the expression for s,
eq. (4.57), obtained with the two-channel approximation of the yukawa vertex. the
expressions obtained in section 4.3 for s(p2) in various regimes are rotated back
to minkowski momentum p2  p2
m exp(i). then the complex poles are given by

p2
m = p2

0 exp (i),

1
s (pm ) = 

2

42g0

+ s(p2

0 exp (i)) = 0.

(4.76)

we can also parametrize the location of a pole by a mass and a width, i.e.,
0 exp (i) = [m  (i/2)]2, which yields
p2

m = p0(cid:20) 1 + cos

(cid:21)1/2

,


m

=

2 sin 

1 + cos 

.

(4.77)

if  is small, then /m  .
near the nambujona-lasinio point (0 = 0) our expression for the vacuum
polarization coincides with that obtained by appelquist et al., eq. (4.59), and we
get the following equations for the resonances:

c2
p2
0

= cos (cid:2)ln(2/p2

0) + 3/2(cid:3) ,

c =

,

and

 +  =(cid:20)ln(2/p2

0) +

3

2(cid:21) tan .

(4.78)

(4.79)

if now g0 is tuned close enough to the critical value gc = 1, so that ln 1/c  1, the
solution is approximately

p2
0

scalar composites in the symmetric phase

and we nd a narrow width

 



ln [g0/2(1  g0)]

.

(4.81)

these results are nothing else than the familiar njl results. for intermediate values
of the gauge coupling, 0 < 0 < c (0 <  < 1), we assume the poles of s are
small, p0/  1, so that

(p0/)  1.

(4.82)

then, from eq. (4.64) we get the following equation for the real part of the pole:

+

1

2(cid:19)
gc  b()(cid:18) p2

0

cos ( + ).

(4.83)

the equation for the imaginary part reads

0  sin ( + ),

where b() is given by eq. (4.65).

the solution is

 =

(n  )



,

and n is odd integer, so that cos ( + ) = 1, thus
g0b() (cid:21)1/2

p0  (cid:20) (1  g0/gc)

.

(4.84)

(4.85)

(4.86)

hence  is only small if   1 for n = 1. the result obtained in ref. [22], see
eq. (4.73), gives a mass

p0  (cid:20) (1  g0/gc)

g0b()

(cid:21)1/2

,

b() =

1

gc(1  2)

.

(4.87)

the pole obtained in ref. [22] is of the same order as eq. (4.86) for values of  close
to 1 (see also discussion in the previous section). for more intermediate values of
 the poles obtained in our approximation are somewhat bigger, since b() > b()
for 0 <  < 1. the quantitative dierence between the result of ref. [22] and
that obtained in this chapter for resonance structures are visualized in fig. 4.5.
in fig. 4.5 the imaginary part of s given by eq. (4.57) and eq. (4.1) is plotted
versus p/m where the tuning of the four-fermion to the critical line is g0/gc = 0.999,
and m/ = (1  g0/gc)1/2. from fig. 4.5 it is clear that the position of the peak
of the resonant curve is slightly shifted to the right in our case at a xed ratio

0/c = 0.01 curve equals 1.

0/c  o(1) (intermediate or small values of ), while the width over mass ratio
remains comparable. near the pure njl point   1 both results coincide.
as was pointed out in the previous section, and following from the restriction
eq. (4.82), these results are only valid for 0/c small. for larger values of the
gauge coupling,   +0, the widths become larger, and eq. (4.82) is no longer
satised. this can also be seen in fig. 4.5. as the ratio 0/c increases the width
increases too, and the position of the peak becomes more dicult to dene.

4.6 again: the conformal phase transition

in this section we analyze the scalar composites near the critical gauge coupling
0 = c, with the purpose of investigating the conformal phase transition, which
was introduced in section 3.6. we recall that the main feature of the cpt is an
abrupt change of the spectrum of light excitations (composites) as the critical point
is crossed, though the phase transition itself is continuous.

in the previous section we encountered a no-cpt, -model-like phase transition

104

scalar composites in the symmetric phase

for values of 0 < c. the masses of light excitations1 are continuous functions
across the critical curve (though non-analytic); there is no abrupt change in the
spectrum of light excitations. in the broken phase the  boson becomes a massless
nambu-goldstone boson, while the fermion and  boson acquire a dynamical mass
which is small with respect to the cuto  near criticality.

the pole at the critical gauge coupling 0 = c is determined by eq. (4.67),
which is rather complicated but we only need to study the ir limit, so we assume
that the pole is small p2

0  2. the infrared limit obtained from eq. (4.67) is

s(q2)

ln(q2/2)  3

,

0   + .

(4.88)

(4.89)

(4.90)

the statement above can be made more explicit.

thus   , and from eq. (4.89) it is clear that if g0  gc = 1/4 both terms on the
right-hand side are positive, and there is no solution for the pole with p0/  1.
hence if there is a pole it will be heavy, i.e., p0/ = o(1). therefore at 0 = c no
light resonances are present in the spectrum for g0  gc = 1/4. the imaginary phase
 approaches  which means the heavy pole occurs at euclidean momentum, a
sign of tachyonic states.
if we analytically continue
the scalar propagator to the values of 0 > c, then we end up in the wrong
vacuum and we should get tachynonic states.
in the broken phase (0 > c),
a chiral symmetric solution still exists, but it is unstable. the  and  bosons
are tachyons for such a solution. the unstable symmetric solution is obtained by
analytic continuation of the solution in the symmetric phase across the critical
curve (at c). the scaling law is determined by the uv properties of the theory
and therefore the scaling law of the tachyonic masses is the same as that of the
fermion and -boson mass in the broken phase.

tachyons are described by an imaginary mass m2 < 0. this means the scalar
propagator must have a real pole for euclidean momentum. if the pole p0 is small,
p0  , we analytically continue eq. (4.63) to 0 > c by replacing  by i,

we then obtain

  i  ip40  1.

which is proportional to the well-know scaling law of quenched qed. thus the scalar
propagator giving the tachyon pole equation, eq. (4.98), reproduces the scaling law
with essential singularity (compare with eq. (3.45)), which is another conrmation
of the cpt.

4.7 renormalization and the scaling hypothesis

in what follows, we discuss the results from the viewpoint of the renormalizability
of the gnjl model. the renormalization is performed by a suitable redenition of
the composite or auxiliary elds  and  (see eq. (1.141)):

 i1
r hz ()

,

 i1
r hz ()

,

(4.99)

where  is related to some physical scale, which should be independent of . the
renormalization factors of the scalar and pseudoscalar elds z ()
 , respectively, z ()



106

scalar composites in the symmetric phase

can be chosen to coincide both in the symmetric and broken phase, and the renor-
malized auxiliary elds r and r dene the renormalized scalar propagator

and the renormalized scalar vertex

r
s (p + q, p) = z ()

 s(p + q, p).

(4.100)

(4.101)

in order to renormalize the scalar propagator and yukawa vertex simultaneously
(see also eqs. (4.64) and (4.75)), the wave function renormalization factor at some
renormalization scale  should be of the form

z ()

 (cid:18) 2

2(cid:19)(1)/2

.

(4.102)

freedom in the choice of renormalization scheme allows us to take the factor z
dened in eq. (4.43) as the wave function renormalization factor, since

z ()
 = z(2/2, )

. (4.103)

hence it follows that four-fermion scattering amplitudes, for instance one-scalar
exchange amplitudes are renormalization group (rg) invariant, i.e.

s (q)r

r
s (p1 + q, p1)r

s (p2, p2 + q)  s(p1 + q, p1)s(q)s(p2, p2 + q), (4.104)
(e.g. see again [22]). consider the case where p2
2  q2, so that the scalar vertices
are described by the uv channels, and suppose that we are suciently close to the
critical line (the ne-tuning condition eq. (3.99))

(4.106)

such a specic power-law behavior for the scalar propagator is essential for the
renormalizability of the gnjl model as is shown in refs. [96, 22, 97, 104, 39].

4.7 renormalization and the scaling hypothesis

107

thus, from eq. (4.102) and eq. (4.75), we get

(4.107)

(4.108)

with these expressions, it is straightforward to check that eq. (4.104) is indeed
independent of  and . hence the renormalization of the auxiliary elds  and ,
eq. (4.99), simultaneously renormalizes the yukawa vertex and the scalar propaga-
tor.

the above considerations can be made more explicit by writing the scalar prop-
agator according to the scaling hypothesis eq. (1.37) (in euclidean formulation).
the scaling hypothesis states that the propagator should have the following form:

s(q) =

1

2 (cid:18) 2

q2(cid:19)1/2

f(|m|2/q2),

(4.109)

where  is by denition the anomalous dimension. we write |m| = p0, with p0 given
by eq. (4.86), where |m| is the analog of the inverse correlation length |m| = 1/,
and   (g0) . then

s(q) = 

42
2

1

b()(cid:18) 2

q2(cid:19)(cid:20)1 +(cid:18)|m|2

a()

b()(cid:18) q2

2(cid:19)1

1

+ . . .(cid:21)

(4.110)

where the exponent 1 > 0 for 0 <  < 1. from this we read of that the anomalous
dimension  is given by

2 = 2   =  = 2(1  ),

and that the scaling function is (provided |m|2, q2  2)

f(x)  

42
b()

1

1 + x .

(4.111)

(4.112)

thus indeed if q2  |m|2 we obtain eq. (4.106), and when q2  |m|2 we get

s(0) =

42
2

g0gc
g0  (g0)   =

,

(4.113)

supporting the fact that the critical exponent  = 1. within the quenched-ladder
approximation, eq. (4.113) agrees with the pcac relation (2.67) and the analyticity

 hi

m0

g0

.

(4.114)

using the eos eqs. (3.29) and (3.30) and the fact that in the symmetric phase (in
the chiral limit)

see eq. (3.101), we get that

 g0  (0/)2 ,

p(0)

g0

(4.115)

s(0)

g0

p(0)

g0

=

gc
g0

.

(4.117)

hence, with g0 = 42g0/2, eq. (4.113) is obtained.

since the absolute value of the resonance i.e., |m| is now the new scale (besides
the uv cuto) generated close to the critical curve, it is natural to take it to be a
physical scale, which by denition should be independent of . using eq. (4.86),
we get the ne-tuning condition

which is equivalent to the ne-tuning condition given in [39], and eq. (3.99).2 hence
the critical curve g0 = gc is an uv xed point g(gc) = 0 (
g(gc) < 0) of the
renormalization group ow.

4.8 summary of results

in this chapter we studied the scalar composites near criticality in the gnjl model.
we obtained an analytic expression for the scalar propagator describing the com-
posite states which is valid along the entire critical curve of the gnjl model. we
presented a method for solving the yukawa vertex in the gnjl in the quenched-
ladder approximation. the crucial assumption was that such a vertex depends only
weakly on the angle between -boson momentum and fermion momentum. the
method presented here incorporated the infrared boundary condition in a more

natural way than previous attempts in this direction. also the observation that
derivatives of the yukawa vertex are singular at zero -boson momentum transfer
is a warning that derivative expansions and taylor series could fail. moreover this
is reected by the property of the scalar composites having noninteger power-law
behavior, which means that, although these states are tightly bound, they are not
pointlike.

the conclusion of the comparison of the method presented here and work done
previously on the -boson propagator is the following. qualitatively the results
obtained by appelquist et al., kondo et al. and by our approximation are in agree-
ment. both methods yield a renormalizable -boson propagator and yukawa vertex
near criticality and nd light resonances for gauge coupling 0 < 0 < c. quanti-
tatively, at a xed value of the gauge coupling, the scalar composites computed in
our case are slightly heavier with comparable width, as is illustrated in fig. 4.5.

in addition, the scalar composites propagator were examined for values of the
coupling near the critical gauge coupling c. near the critical line 0 = c, g0 < 1
4
the conformal phase transition is encountered and the spectrum of light excitations
(resonances) in the symmetric phase disappears. moreover the well-known scaling
law with essential singularity, which is characteristic for the cpt, was recovered by
analytic continuation of the -boson propagator across the critical curve at 0 = c.

on the existence of
ultra-violet xed points

5.1 beyond the quenched approximation

the general consensus on u (1) gauge theories such as the gnjl model is that
they are trivial. once fermion-loops are present the electromagnetic charge will
be screened completely in the continuum limit (  ). but we argue that
(pseudo)scalar degrees of freedom play an important role, and in case of the gnjl
model, provided the number of fermion avors n exceeds some critical value, ultra-
violet (uv) xed points can be realized. the existence of uv xed points gives rise
to a non-trivial theory.

the crucial mechanism responsible for the realization of such a nontrivial root
of the  function of the gauge coupling is given by the formation of tight scalar
and pseudoscalar resonances in the symmetric phase or bound states in the broken
phase near the critical line. in other words, the formation, due to the strong coupling
chiral symmetry breaking dynamics, of neutral scalars and pseudoscalar composites
reduces the screening of charge.

as a perturbation theory, qed has been proven to be a successful gauge eld
theory, tested at extremely high precision. however, in the language of the renor-
malization group, perturbative qed appears to be a trivial theory in four dimen-
sions (see ref. [42]). in the continuum limit, taking the cuto  to innity, the
eective or running gauge coupling vanishes, and the theory becomes a free eld
(i.e. trivial) theory.

in the renormalized theory, triviality represents itself in the form of the so-
called landau ghost, which is a singularity in the rg transformation for the gauge
coupling 0 at  = lg, see refs. [42, 145, 146]. the renormalized theory should
then be considered as an eective theory, which is not dened for distances shorter

on the existence of ultra-violet xed points

than 1/lg, see ref. [2]. in qed the landau ghost lg lies far beyond the planck
scale, and is not of practical importance.

the triviality of qed originates from the screening of charged particles by their
interactions with virtual fermion anti-fermion pairs from the vacuum. such charge
screening is described by the vacuum polarization , eq. (2.22), and the implications
of the one-loop leading contribution were discussed in refs. [147, 148, 149]:

(q2) =

log

(5.1)

where n is the number of fermion avors. the qed vacuum is not a perfect insu-
lator and can be considered as a medium of dipoles, where the dipoles represent the
virtual fermion anti-fermion pairs (i.e. the fermion loops in the vacuum polariza-
tion). this logarithmic screening eect is sucient to cause the complete screening
of charge in the continuum limit.

the charge screening and charge renormalization give rise to a running gauge

coupling, i.e. 0 depends on the cut-o , and the roots 0 of the  function,

(0)  

d0
d

= 0,

(5.2)

are essential in the renormalization group analysis. such a root is either a gaussian
xed point corresponding to a trivial theory or an uv xed point (i.e critical xed
point) corresponding to a nontrivial continuum limit. in case of perturbative qed,
the only zero of  is the origin 0 = 0, the gaussian xed point.
in case of
asymptotic free theories such as qcd the origin is an uv xed point. a nontrivial
(interacting) theory arises whenever  has a root which is an uv xed point. the
rst formulation of the renormalization group for the gauge coupling 0 of qed
and speculations about the existence of a xed point was given in ref. [16].

although the conclusions concerning qed are usually drawn from the one-
loop results, the two-loop computations of ref. [150] and the three-loop (quenched)
computations of refs. [151, 152] are consistent with the view that qed is trivial.
in this context we should mention that the eort of johnson, baker, willey, and
adler [46, 153, 154, 155] to nd a nite nontrivial continuum limit of qed was
inspired by the simplicity and the negative sign of the three-loop result of rosner.
no realization of the scenario presented by johnson et al. has been found, mainly
because they were looking for a perturbative resolution. the problem is that for
a possible nontrivial continuum limit of qed, critical and hence nonperturbative
dynamics is required.

therefore, the discovery of dynamical chiral symmetry breaking in the strong
coupling phase of qed and the existence of an uv xed point in the quenched-
ladder approximation sheds new light on the nonperturbative nature of qed. the
fundamental notion is that composite degrees of freedom play an important role in
resolving the scaling behavior of the theory near criticality. the gnjl model is the

5.1 beyond the quenched approximation

113

generalization of strong coupling qed analysis taking into account the composite
degrees of freedom.

an interesting attempt to incorporate the dynamics of chiral symmetry breaking
(e.g. the formation of bound states) was made in ref. [156]. kocic et al. argued
that magnetic eects described by parts of the transverse vertex (the vertex function
5) could prevent the total screening of charge. however, we think that the analysis
of kocic et al.
lacks an inhomogeneous term in the equation for the transverse
vertex function. it is precisely the inhomogeneous term that introduces boundary
conditions which eliminate the nontrivial solution for the transverse vertex function
obtained by kocic et al., henceforth, their scenario is not suitable to resolve the
triviality problem.

magnetic eects described by the transverse vertex can only be proportional to
the fermion dynamical mass; singular solutions of the type proposed by kocic et
al. are eliminated by ultraviolet boundary conditions. since the fermion dynam-
ical mass vanishes close to criticality (large correlation length), it is unlikely that
magnetic eects are important for the study of charge screening.

we speculate therefore that some other mechanism is responsible for the pos-
sible realization of an uv xed point, and the absence of charge screening, in the
unquenched gnjl model. formally irrelevant four-fermion interactions become
relevant near the critical line of the chiral phase transition,

(5.3)

gc() = (1 + )2/4,

 =p1  0/c,

and the dynamics of the composite states described by the four-fermion interactions
might play a crucial role in the phenomenon of charge screening.

dynamical symmetry breaking is an inherently nonperturbative phenomenon,
and, due to the lack of other solvable approximations, has been predominantly stud-
ied in the framework of sdes in the quenched-ladder approximation. as was men-
tioned in chapter 3, the physical implications and the consistency of the quenched-
ladder results with many quenched lattice simulations, and with the nonperturba-
tive rg techniques, support the view that the qualitative features of the approach
might be realistic and describe properties of the full theory. moreover the ladder
approach respects the vector and axial wardtakahashi identities.

the quenched approximation is analogous to the assumption that the full gauge
boson propagator d (k) can be approximated by the bare or canonical propagator
(for large momenta),

(5.4)

in the landau gauge. the quenched approximation is only consistent when the
vacuum polarization is nite in the continuum limit, i.e. the logarithmic running
of the coupling is absent. this is the case at an uv xed point of the  function
eq. (5.2) of 0. the assumption that such a critical xed point exists, and that

114

on the existence of ultra-violet xed points

it lies somewhere on the critical curve (5.3) is the starting point for many studies
of dynamical chiral symmetry breaking in context of the gnjl model. in fact the
quenched hypothesis is only consistent when the bare gauge coupling 0 is the uv
xed point of the theory, (0) = 0.

attempts to include a logarithmic running of the coupling drastically changes
the chiral phase transition and the critical line, see refs. [129, 130, 131, 157]. it was
shown in refs. [131, 93, 158, 159] that m = 2, which is analogous to the vanishing
of the anomalous dimension of the scalar propagator,  = 2(2  m) = 0 (e.g.
see eq. (4.109)). consequently, the critical exponents turn out to be of the mean
eld type. the quenched theory and the theory with the logarithmically running
coupling seem to be two dierent theories.

it is essential to incorporate the composite degrees of freedom and their eec-
tive interactions to properly understand the scaling structure of the full unquenched
gnjl model. in case of the gnjl model, the four-fermion interactions are treated
in a mean eld approach known as the hartreefock approximation, see also sec-
tion 3.1. we recall that by mean eld approach, we refer to approximations which
neglect quantum corrections corresponding to four-fermion interactions beyond tree
level.

the merit of the mean eld approximation is the decoupling of sdes. clearly it
is necessary to check the consistency between the initial assumptions and the nal
result. as long as four-fermion interactions are irrelevant the mean-eld approach
for these operators is justied. however the conclusions of refs.[24, 23] are that the
quenched-ladder approximations with four-fermion interactions in the mean eld
approach satisfy the hyperscaling equations for the critical exponents, suggesting
that the four-fermion operators become relevant due to the appearance of large
anomalous dimensions. in other words, the mean eld approach yields nonmean-
eld exponents, thereby being inconsistent (e.g. see refs.[4, 92]).

the uctuations of the gauge eld for the composite degrees of freedom are
essential and cannot be neglected; they give rise to a large anomalous dimension
turning irrelevant four-fermion interaction into relevant ones implying that such
interactions give nontrivial quantum corrections (they cannot be neglected beyond
tree level.) this is supported by the computations of the anomalous scaling laws for
the yukawa vertices and the propagators of the scalar and pseudoscalar composite
states, i.e. the  and  bosons of chapter 4. in fact, as was discussed in section 3.5,
the hyperscaling relations imply the existence of a nontrivial yukawa interaction
describing the interaction between fermions and  and  composites in the gnjl
model.

the question is; how to modify the mean eld approach? an appropriate answer
depends on the following three concepts: skeleton expansions, the 1/n expansion
(with n the number of fermion avors), and the specic form of the chiral symmetry.
clearly going beyond the quenched approximation seems only interesting once four-
fermion interactions are treated beyond the mean eld approach.

5.2 beyond the mean eld approach

5.2 beyond the mean eld approach

let us rst review the concept of the so-called skeleton expansions. the anomalous
dimensions follow from the scaling structure of the fully dressed yukawa vertices and
 and  propagators, hence it is necessary to incorporate the full green functions
corresponding to the four-fermionic composite degrees of freedom (or at least the
leading or asymptotic parts of these functions). therefore it is crucial to study such
issues in a renormalization group (rg) invariant manner. this can be done on the
level of the bethe-salpeter fermionanti-fermion scattering kernels in the skeleton
expansion (see e.g. bjorken and drell [44]).

analogous to the pure qed kernels we dene the one-boson irreducible kernel
k (1), and the two-fermion one-boson irreducible kernel k (2), where these kernels
now also include the  and  composites. for both type of kernels a skeleton
expansion exists, and the integral equation between k (1) and k (2) is known as the
bethe-salpeter equation. the skeleton expansion is a series in topologically distinct
feynman diagrams with all vertices and propagators fully dressed. each term in the
skeleton expansion of the bs kernel is rg invariant, up to fermion wave function
factors, i.e. the expansion is independent of the renormalization factors z3 and
z = z = z (see eqs. (1.140) and (1.141)) of, respectively, the gauge eld and
the composite elds  and . the two z 1 factors with anomalous dimensions of
each yukawa vertex cancel with the z 2 factors of the  and  propagators. since
in the quenched approximation the renormalization constant of the gauge eld is
one (z3 = 1), the quenched-ladder approximation is consistent from the rg point
of view.

the gnjl model, with n number of fermion avors, is taken to be invariant
under global ul(n )  ur(n ) chiral transformations, so that both the scalar and
pseudoscalar four-fermion interactions are in the adjoint representation, and, con-
sequently, the number of scalar composites (n 2) equals the number of pseudoscalar
composites (n 2). in this way, when n is large we can use the 1/n expansion intro-
duced by t hooft [45]. the 1/n expansion states that planar, i.e. ladder, graphs
describe the dominant contribution to green functions. the 1/n expansion will be
discussed in the next section.

with the gauge interaction treated in the ladder approximation each full yukawa

vertex and ,  boson propagator can be written as

as a result of the chiral symmetry the contributions of four-fermion interactions,
which are represented by  and  exchanges, exhibit two distinct features depending
on whether they are incorporated in sdes describing quantities connected with so-
called zero-spin structures1 (e.g. the dynamical mass , the yukawa vertices s,
p, and the  and  propagators s, p), or whether the exchanges are included in
sdes describing nonzero-spin structures (anti-commuting with 5) (e.g. the vacuum
polarization , the photon-fermion vertex , and the fermion wave function z).
henceforth, we refer to (non)zero-spin functions, and their equations as (non)zero-
spin channels.

the chiral symmetry gives rise to the following properties:

1. in spin-zero-channels, the contribution of planar diagrams (i.e. planar in 
and  exchanges) vanishes due to the fact that the exchange of a  has an
opposite sign with respect to a  exchange. why? let us consider a planar
contribution to the scalar vacuum polarization which contains (amongst oth-
ers) a  exchange. both 5 matrices corresponding to this particular planar 
exchange can be eliminated from the fermion trace of the scalar vacuum polar-
ization by moving them to right-hand side of the trace. for planar diagrams
such a process involves the interchange of the 5 matrix with an even number
of fermion propagators, and an arbitrary number of yukawa vertices. since
the yukawa vertices commute with the 5 matrix, and 5 anti-commutes with
the fermion propagator2 s, the process of moving the 5 to the right does not
introduce an overall minus sign. now using that (i5)(i5) = (1)(1), we see
that such a specic  exchange is identical to minus the same diagram with
the  exchange replaced by a  exchange. since each diagram containing a 
exchange has a scalar counter part (i.e. an analogous diagram with a  instead

1such structures are characterized by spinor matrices which commute with the 5 matrix.
2in the symmetric phase 5s = s5.

5.3 the 1/n expansion

117

of a  exchange), the sum of all planar diagrams, with a particular number of
exchanges, vanishes. thus in channels with spin-zero matrix structures (i.e.
channels which correspond to vertices which commute with 5) scalar forces
appear to be opposite to pseudoscalar forces.

2. in nonzero-spin channels (think of , , etc.) containing vertices which
anti-commute with the 5 matrix, the situation is dierent: planar  and
 exchanges contribute with identical sign. let us now consider a planar
contribution to the (photon) vacuum polarization containing a  exchange.
if we again move the 5 matrices to the right-hand side of the trace, we
get an overall minus sign due to the anti-commutation of 5 with . this
means that any planar diagram in the vacuum polarization containing a 
exchange is identical to the same diagram with the  exchange replaced by a 
exchange. hence, in channels connected with spin structures anti-commuting
with 5,  and  exchanges behave identical. in other words, in such channels,
pseudoscalar and scalar forces act in the same direction (instead of canceling).

the properties described above are, strictly speaking, only valid in the symmetric
(massless) phase, where the  and  bosons are degenerate. however, in the broken
phase, the properties are valid whenever momenta larger than the dynamical mass 
or inverse correlation length 1  m are considered, because then the degeneracy
emerges too.
these properties also provide us with a general argument why the mean eld
approach for four-fermion operators for green functions corresponding to spin-zero
channels (e.g. s and s of chapter 4) is reliable. for such channels planar con-
tributions vanish and the next non-vanishing contributions (such as contributions
containing crossed  and  exchanges) are proportional to 1/n , thus small for large
n . this suggests that quantities such as the critical curve, dynamical mass, anoma-
lous dimensions etc., are nearly independent of n , and are described rather well by
the mean eld approach.

however, such a cancellation of scalars against pseudoscalars degrees of freedom
does not occur in nonzero-spin channels, such as the vacuum polarization . in the
vacuum polarization it turns out that  and  exchanges are attractive and virtual
fermion anti-fermion pairs from vacuum uctuations are constrained by these forces,
reducing their capability to screen.

5.3 the 1/n expansion

the 1/n expansion of t hooft (see refs. [45, 160]) provides us with a useful non-
perturbative tool to incorporate four-fermion interactions beyond the mean eld
approach. as mentioned previously, the 1/n expansion states that the planar (i.e.
ladder) diagrams, with fermions at the edges, describe the leading or dominant
contributions to green functions. the interesting feature of the 1/n expansion

118

on the existence of ultra-violet xed points

is that feynman diagrams can be classied in terms of two-dimensional surfaces
with specic topology. diagrams with other (than planar) topological structures
are multiplied by factors of 1/n , and in the limit of large n , their contribution can
be neglected with respect to planar graphs.

in the formulation of the 1/n expansion of t hooft, the planar graphs coincide
with ladder graphs in case of the gnjl model. one important rule is to draw
feynman graphs with fermion loops forming the boundary of the graph (if possible).
in this way, vertex corrections are not necessarily classied as being planar, e.g. see
fig. 9 of section 3.1 of the book by coleman [160].

in the context of the paper by t hooft which deals mainly with qcd, we should
consider internal or virtual  and  exchanges analogous to gluon exchanges, with
the important dierence that due to the chiral symmetry we have two types of par-
ticles both being in the adjoint representation (n 2 scalars and n 2 pseudoscalars).
suppose we can dene an eective yukawa coupling gy describing the in-
teraction of scalars and pseudoscalar with fermions. for the time being we leave
unspecied such a coupling. let us consider n large with g2
y n is xed and of order
one

g2
y n  o(1).

(5.9)

y n , a 1/n expansion can be formulated straightforwardly.

if the theory under consideration is rewritten in terms of the coupling constant
g2
n  g2
then, by keeping track of the avor indices within a particular feynman dia-
gram, we can count factors of 1/n . each fermion carries a avor index (i), which
runs from 1 to n . a virtual ,  exchange carries two avor indices. this fol-
lows from eq. (5.6) and the fierz identity (5.7). each virtual ,  exchange is
associated with two yukawa vertices, therefore giving rise to a pair of kronecker
delta functions connecting the avor indices of the scattered fermions. in the con-
text of avor indices, either a  or  boson can be considered as a propagating
fermionanti-fermion pair carrying double avor indices.

whenever a trace over a avor kronecker delta function enters into the expres-
sion for a particular feynman diagram, we speak of an index loop. an index loop
is easily identied by using the double-line representation of t hooft. a fermion
propagator is represented by a single index-line (i.e.
fermion line), whereas each
internal scalar, respectively, pseudoscalar propagator is represented by a double
index-line. consequently, whenever, after drawing a particular feynman diagram,
an index-line closes, it forms an index loop giving rise to a factor

a particular feynman diagram containing a number of virtual  and  exchanges
is associated with a factor

(5.11)

5.4 regularization and the fermion wave function

119

where v is the number of yukawa vertices, and i the number of index loops. the

r = (g2

y n )v /2n  = gv

n n ,

where the euler characteristic  is given by

 = 2  2h  b,

(5.12)

(5.13)

with h the number of handles, and b the number of holes of the two di-
mensional surface to which the feynman diagram can be associated. the euler
characteristic  is a topological invariant. for instance, the vacuum polarization
has the topology of a sphere with a single hole (i.e. a disk), where the fermion-loop
forms the boundary (i.e. hole) of the graph. thus planar diagrams in the vacuum
polarization with n exchanges of s and s are associated with a factor

r = n (g2

y n )n.

(5.14)

other types of diagrams, e.g. diagrams with one crossed , respectively,  exchange
have the topology of a disk with a handle, hence giving rise to a factor

r = n 1(g2

y n )2.

(5.15)

however, the sum of such type of vacuum polarization diagrams is zero due to the
chiral symmetry.

since planar diagrams vanish in spin-zero channels such as the sde for the
dynamical mass, the rst nonzero contribution is given by diagrams with crossed
 and  exchanges, and vertex corrections. those type of diagrams have one extra
handle as compared with planar graphs. therefore in zero-spin channels, we should
compare e.g. graphs with a single handle with the gauge interaction in the planar
(ladder) approximation. furthermore, each handle correspond to a factor g4
y , and
since gy is small because of the assumption (5.9), g4
y should be compared with the
gauge coupling 0. then, if the following inequality holds

0  2

y /,

y = g2

y /4,

(5.16)

the gauge interaction dominates over four-fermion interactions, and we have an
argument supporting the validity of the mean eld approach in such channels.

5.4 regularization and the fermion wave function

the inclusion of relevant four-fermion interactions beyond the mean eld approach
requires a reinvestigation of the sde for the fermion wave function z. in qed
in the quenched approximation, the fermion wave function has a gauge dependent

120

on the existence of ultra-violet xed points

anomalous dimension. in the landau gauge, this anomalous dimension vanishes and
the fermion wave function equals one (z = 1). we conjecture that the inclusion of
relevant four-fermion interactions does not introduce an anomalous dimension for
the fermion wave function other than already introduced by the gauge interactions.
thus, in the landau gauge, the wave function z is nite though it might deviate
from unity. the argument in support of the conjecture stated above is that only one
full yukawa vertex appears in the self-energy part, which means that anomalous
dimensions of four-fermion interactions are not canceled. only two fully dressed
yukawa vertices and a fully dressed scalar composite are renormalization group
invariant (anomalous dimensions cancel!).

the consequence is that a remnant power of the cuto (related to anomalous
dimension of a yukawa vertex) lowers the degree of divergence of the self-energy
part from a logarithmic divergence to a nite integral. the question is how to
compute the nite correction to z.
the problem of the self-energy sdes lies in regulating it. in case of the fermion-
loops appearing in vacuum polarizations it is possible to introduce pauli-villars
elds which will regulate the fermion loops. however an additional regularization
and elds are needed in order to regulate self-energy parts of the fermion, especially
the wave function, since the sde is naively linearly divergent, and shifts in momen-
tum integration variables are tricky. a momentum shift invariant regularization is
by no means trivial to implement. at the moment we do not know how to properly
regularize the sde for z, and how to compute a possible deviation of z from unity
in the landau gauge.
we believe that the conjecture holds irrespectively of the regularization method.
therefore throughout this chapter we assume z = 1. eventually, a deviation from
unity might change the results presented here quantitatively, although this is not ex-
pected, since we will use a nonperturbative method introduced by johnson, willey,
and baker [46], which is independent of z. the nice feature of the assumption that
z = 1 is that with the gauge interaction treated in the quenched-ladder approach
the chiral and vector wardtakahashi identities are preserved, since in channels
with spin-zero the planar  and  exchanges cancel each other.

5.5 scalars, pseudoscalars, and charge screening

since, in the gnjl model, the scalars and pseudoscalars are neutral states which
therefore do not couple to the photon eld, their contribution to the vacuum po-
larization is described indirectly in terms of photon-fermion vertex corrections, and
fermion self-energy corrections. hence, in order to gain some intuition for the role
of scalar degrees of freedom on the mechanism of charge screening, we analyze the
two-loop contribution arising from  and  exchanges to the vacuum polarization.
let us consider a gaugehiggsyukawa type of interaction described by the

the interesting result of this computation is dierence in sign between terms cor-
responding to photon exchanges, and terms corresponding to (pseudo)scalar ex-
changes. furthermore, we might be tempted to conclude that a nontrivial root of
eq. (5.20) could be realized whenever n y /2  2/3. however, the complete situ-
ation is more involved. the rg equation for e.g. y should be considered too, i.e.
we should compute the  functions of y , and of any quartic scalar coupling. if
and only if a nontrivial (nonzero) uv xed point for y exists, the realization of a
zero of eq. (5.20) becomes a realistic option. in other words, such a scenario is only
possible if the yukawa interaction y is nontrivial. the discussion in section 3.5
suggests that in order to obtain a nontrivial yukawa coupling, the hyperscaling laws
should be obeyed.

in this context, we mention that the renormalization of gauge-higgs-yukawa
models, with a non-abelian gauge interaction, has been considered extensively in
ref. [161]. in that paper, it was shown that special nontrivial cases of gauge-higgs-
yukawa models are equivalent to gnjl models with non-abelian (asymptotically
free) gauge interaction (see also ref. [162]), hence proving the renormalizability of
non-abelian gnjl models.

on the existence of ultra-violet xed points

moreover, in appendix e it is shown explicitly that when gauge-invariant four-
fermion interactions are treated perturbatively (thus their anomalous dimensions
are small), they do not contribute to the vacuum polarization, and consequently
. in fact, the conclusion can be drawn beforehand, since the rg of wilson states
that irrelevant interactions cannot aect low-energy eective quantities.

summarizing, we have illustrated that fundamental scalars and pseudoscalars
in a gauge-higgs-yukawa system tend to decrease charge screening. on the other-
hand, perturbatively irrelevant four-fermion interaction do not contribute to the
vacuum polarization. the idea is that, nonperturbatively, close to the critical curve
in the gnjl model, the scalar and pseudoscalar yukawa interactions are nontrivial,
and kinetic terms for the scalar and pseudoscalar composites are eectively induced
via the appearance of a large anomalous dimension.

5.6 the vacuum polarization in the 1/n expansion

in studying the vacuum polarization, the usual assumption is to neglect vacuum
polarization corrections to internal photon propagators. as explained earlier, such
a quenching of internal photon propagators is supposed to be valid close to a xed
point. thus, following ref. [46], with the replacement of full photon propagators
by the bare ones (e.g. eq. (5.4)), the vacuum polarization should be of the form:

(2) = [/, 0]  f (0) log

2
2 + o(1).

(5.21)

the vacuum polarization contains only a single power of log . higher powers of
log , which correspond to a higher number of fermion-loops, are absent. further-
more, the constant term and other small corrections to  are irrelevant for the
question of screening. the vacuum polarization denes a running coupling (),

() =

0

1 + [/, 0]

,

where we dene 0 = (), and the  function eq. (5.2) at () is

(())  

d()

d

.

(5.22)

(5.23)

since the bare coupling is independent of , we have the identity

(0) = lim




d()

d

= 20f (0).

(5.24)

thus the function f (0) is proportional to the  function, and since it is a non-
singular function in 0 clearly the  function has a gaussian or trivial xed point

5.6 the vacuum polarization in the 1/n expansion

123

at 0 = 0, i.e., (0) = 0. to obtain an uv xed point it is essential that, for
 < z (where z is a root of ), the  function is positive. hence, the equation
(see eq. (1.76))

(z) = 0,


(z) < 0,

(5.25)

determines an uv xed point z.

the function f (0) has been studied thoroughly by johnson et al. in refs. [46,
153, 155] and by adler [154] in the context of massless qed, these authors write
(according to johnson et al. [46])

f (0) =

n 0

2 (cid:20) 2

3

+ (0)(cid:21) ,

(5.26)

where the term with the 2/3 is the one-loop vacuum polarization. johnson et al.
derived an expression for (0) in terms of the bethe-salpeter (bs) kernel k (2)
as the single unknown green function.
in dening the bs kernels we follow the
denitions of bjorken and drell [44]. we mention that, although the strong belief
of johnson et al. in the possible existence of an uv xed point for 0, might seem
poorly motivated from the point of view of wilsons rg methods (see ref [15])3,
their methods and techniques are still valid and directly applicable to the gnjl
model.

the bs kernel k (1) is dened as the one-boson irreducible fermion-fermion scat-
tering kernel, and the bs kernel k (2) as the two-fermion one-boson irreducible
fermion-fermion scattering kernel. the integral equation between k (1) and k (2) is
the bethesalpeter equation, which is depicted in fig. b.2. in appendix f we give
a derivation of the johnsonwilleybaker (jwb) equation for , their result is

the derivatives of the bs kernels k (2) are dened in appendix f. furthermore,

(5.31)

for the bs kernels there exists a so-called skeleton expansion (see also [44]),
which is an expansion in topologically distinct feynman diagrams with all vertices
and propagators fully dressed. the skeleton expansion is a special way of resum-
ming the entire set of feynman diagrams in a consistent manner, i.e., without
double counting. the lowest order terms (lowest in terms of loops) of the skele-
ton expansions for k (1), respectively, k (2) are illustrated in fig. 5.1, respectively,
fig. 5.2.

as was pointed out in section 5.3, the 1/n expansion states that the planar
diagrams for the  and  exchanges are dominant. the approximation for the
bs kernel k (2), which generates the entire set of planar scalar and pseudoscalar
skeleton diagrams for the vacuum polarization is the following: the bs kernel k (2)
is approximated by its lowest order skeleton graph, i.e.,

the decomposition of the yukawa vertices in terms of scalar functions is given by
eqs. (2.42) and (2.43). first of all, as was explained in chapter 4, in the symmetric
phase the yukawa vertex structure function f3 and f4 are zero, and the scalar and
pseudoscalar vertex functions are identical

f (s)
1 = f (p)

1 = f1,

f (s)
2 = f (p)

2 = f2,

(5.33)

and so are the  and  propagators, s = p. secondly, it was shown in appendix d
that the structure function f2 is rather small compared to the leading structure
function f1. (it is assumed that f1 describes the leading asymptotic behavior of the
yukawa vertices). therefore, we neglect contributions related to the scalar structure
function f2. although it might be possible that the contribution coming from gauge
interactions is smaller, than corrections resulting from this structure function f2,
we keep the gauge interaction in order to compare with results mentioned in the
literature. thus, we take for k (2)

where f1 is given by the ladder sde (4.8), and s by eq. (4.1) and (4.14).

with this truncation for the bs kernel k (2), we can actually compute the j
functions (5.28)(5.30), and subsequently analyze the  function (5.31). we recall
that, in the vacuum polarization, the scalars and pseudoscalars give the same con-
tribution in the functions j . moreover the sum over avor indices yields a factor of
n in the expressions for j for contributions corresponding to  and  exchanges.

5.7 analysis of the johnsonwilleybaker func-

tions

in computing the functions j , we initially neglect the ladder photon exchange in
eq. (5.34). since such contributions were already computed by johnson et al. [46],
it will be rather easy to include them later on in the analysis.

it is straightforward to show that, within the proposed approximations, 2 van-

ishes. using eq. (5.34), we obtain that

trhp pk (p, k)(k  k)i  trhp p(k  k)i = 0.

thus,

2(0) = 0.

what remains is the evaluation of 1 and 3. with

trh( p   p)(k  k)i = 96p  k,

the equation for 1 eq. (5.28) reads

1(0) = 2n iz
= 2n iz

(5.35)

(5.36)

(5.37)

(5.38)

where in last step, we have performed a supposedly harmless4 shift of integration,
and used the fact that f1 is symmetric in the fermion momenta, f1(p, k) = f1(k, p),
because of charge conjugation properties, see eq. (2.44). the factor n results from
the trace of the avor kronecker  function, i.e. an index line which closes. after

since the integrals for the functions j are nite, the cuto can be taken to innity
(the continuum limit). this can be written as

(5.41)

the function g1 is dened with a minus sign to make it a positive function, as will
be shown to be the case later. the angular integral can be performed if we dene
the following chebyshev expansion

k2(k  p + k2)

(k + p)4

=



xn=0

cn(k2, p2)un(cos ),

the chebyshev expansion for the function f1 was already introduced in eq. (4.16)
(and [40]), and reads

f1(k + p, k) =



xn=0

fn(k2, p2)un(cos ).

(5.45)

thus, following analogous derivations in appendix d, the function g1 can be ex-
pressed as

g1(p2/k2) =  lim



p2s(p)

82



xl,m,n=0

clmn cl(k2, p2)fm(k2, p2)fn(k2, p2),

(5.46)

where the constants clmn are given in eq. (d.17). we approximate g1 by keeping
only the lowest order term in the chebyshev expansion,

g1(p2/k2)   lim



p2s(p)

82

c0(k2, p2)(cid:2)f0(k2, p2)(cid:3)2

,

(5.47)

where f0 is decomposed into the two channel functions fuv and fir, see eq. (4.23).
then, the asymptotics, k2  p2, respectively, p2  k2, of g1 are well approximated
by the lowest order chebyshev term (5.47). again, this is the two channel approx-
imation for the yukawa vertices of chapter 4. however for momenta k2  p2 the
channel approximation is not necessarily valid. so, how about g1(1)? since, from
the appendix d, eq. (d.32), it follows that

f2n(k2, p2)  0,

f2n+1(k2, p2)  0,

(5.48)

on the existence of ultra-violet xed points

from eq. (d.17) that

c(2l+1)(2m+1)(2n+1) = c(2l+1)(2m)(2n) = 0,

 l, m, n,

(5.49)

and from eq. (d.9) that

cn(k2, k2) =

(1)n

2

 c2n(k2, k2)  0,

c2n+1(k2, k2)  0.

(5.50)

hence, we conclude that all terms of the series



xl,m,n=0

clmn cl(k2, k2)fm(k2, k2)fn(k2, k2),

(5.51)

of g1 are positive, and the lowest order term gives a lower bound on the series,

c0(k2, k2)(cid:2)f0(k2, k2)(cid:3)2





xl,m,n=0

clmncl(k2, k2)fm(k2, k2)fn(k2, k2).

(5.52)

therefore, the approximation eq. (5.47) is reliable for the asymptotics k2  p2,
and p2  k2. moreover, eq. (5.47) is a lower bound on eq. (5.46) at k2 = p2,
so that at least we wont overestimate the contribution of scalar and pseudoscalar
composites to the vacuum polarization.

the function g1 can now be computed, since f0 is expressed in terms of the
channel functions fuv and fir of chapter 4. furthermore, from eq. (5.44) we see
that

c0(k2, p2) = (k2  p2).

(5.53)

and the only nonzero contribution to g1 of eq. (5.47) comes from the momenta
k2  p2. thus, using eqs. (5.47), (5.53), and (4.23), we nd

g1(p2/k2)   lim



p2s(p)

82

[fuv(k2, p2)]2(k2  p2).

(5.54)

the ultraviolet channel function fuv is proportional to the factor z 1(p2/2, ),
eq. (4.43), and the scalar propagator is proportional to z 2. thus the z factors in
eq. (5.54) cancel as was expected and the angular integral eq. (5.41) can indeed be
written in terms of a function which depends only on the ratio of p2/k2.

recall that the scaling form for the scalar propagator is

(5.75)

therefore, the approximation eq. (5.74) is even better than the analogous approx-

in the computation of the functions 1, 2, and 3 the ladder (planar) photon
exchanges have been neglected. after reinstating the ladder photon exchange term
in eq. (5.34), we obtain, together with eqs. (5.58) and (5.78), that

1(0) =

0
2  n 1(0), 2(0) = 0, 3(0) = n 3(0).

the ladder photon exchange only contributes to 1, see again [46]. after substitu-

tions 1(0) and 3(0). these functions have been plotted versus 0/c in fig. 5.3.

figure 5.3: the functions 1 and 3 plotted versus 0/c.

firstly, it is clear that the 1 and 3, are positive, and have a maximum at some
intermediate value of 0 < 0 < /3. for instance, 1 has a maximum 1  0.123 at
0/c  0.58 (  0.65). secondly, the functions 1 and 3 vanish at the pure njl
point 0 = 0, and at the cpt point 0 = c = /3. at 0 = 0, we can consider
this is as a reection of the fact that hyperscaling breaks down due to logarithmic
corrections; the eective yukawa coupling is trivial, therefore vanishes, see again
the discussion in section 3.5. at 0 = c, where the critical exponents become
singular, the vanishing of 1 and 3 is related to the dynamics of the cpt, see
sections 3.6 and 4.6. there are no light  and  exchanges in the symmetric phase
which consequently implies the absence of eective yukawa interactions.5

let us illustrate this by comparing the  function (5.83) with the  function of
the gauge-higgs-yukawa model (5.17) in the 1/n expansion. then, the entire set
of planar  and  exchanges is generated by the kernel

with such a kernel, 2 and 3 are zero, because the right-hand side of eq. (5.84)

again we introduce the ladder photon exchanges by the replacement

comparing the  functions (5.83) and (5.89) leads to the suggestion that 1(0) is
analogous to the yukawa coupling y in a gauge-higgs-yukawa model,

1(0) 

y
2

.

(5.90)

this is a crucial point. the general consensus is that for a gauge-higgs-yukawa
model the yukawa interaction y is trivial, thus y  0 in eq. (5.89). however,
the situation is essentially dierent for 1 in the gnjl model. there the eective
coupling 1 is formed by the exchange of  and  bosons, with the yukawa vertices,
and (pseudo)scalar propagators fully dressed (i.e. the skeleton expansion). the
cancellation of the z factors, see eq. (4.104), which is related to the fact that
the hyperscaling equations are satised, gives rise to a nite nonzero 1(0) at the

5.8 uv xed points

135

critical curve for 0 < 0 < c. the other nonzero function 3 results from taking
into account fully dressed yukawa vertices.

let us now the discuss the possible existence of uv xed points. a necessary
but not a sucient condition for the realization of an uv xed point is that n 1
has to be larger than both n 3 and 0/2, and n 1  o(1). for large n , the
contribution of the planar photon exchanges (represented by the 0/2 terms) is
negligible with respect to n 1 and n 3. moreover fig. 5.3 shows, for 0 small, that
1 is considerably larger than 3. this suggests that only for avors n larger than
some critical value nc uv xed points can be obtained.

by substituting the expressions (5.60) and (5.80) for 1 and 3 in eq. (5.83), we
can straightforwardly analyze the  function graphically. in fig. 5.4 the  function
is plotted for various values of n . fig. 5.4 shows that for values of n > nc, with
55 > nc > 54, uv xed points exists, the largest being 0  0.14,

uv xed point. moreover, fig. 5.4 suggests that the uv xed points are rst order
zeros of , and clearly satisfy eq. (5.25).

since we have made use of results obtained in the quenched approximation, we
mention that the plots of the  function are (at the most) reliable at or in the
vicinity of the uv xed points at which the quenched approach is self consistent.

in fig. 5.5, the case of n = 60 fermion avors is compared with the one-loop
 function of qed. for very small values of 0 < 1/100 indeed the one-loop qed
result coincides with that of the gnjl model, however for larger values of 0 the 
function (5.83) deviates from the one-loop expression, and eventually an uv xed
point is realized at 0  0.1.

the analysis shows that a rather large number of avors,

is required to obtain uv xed points. from the point of view of the 1/n expansion
this seems a consistent result, since other than planar contributions are suppressed
by at least factors of (say) 1/nc. however, from the phenomenological point of
view, the result is unsatisfactory, since it implies that the unquenched gnjl model

137

(exhibiting uv xed points) is only practically applicable for models which have
at least nc fermion avors (fractions rounded up). therefore, it is appropriate to
discuss how nc depends on the approximation.

firstly, we stress that the second term on the right-hand side in eq. (5.83) con-
taining the 1 function causes the suppression of charge screening and is responsible
for the possible realization of an uv xed point. the denominator in the second
term is a direct consequence of the resummation of the innite ladder  and  ex-
changes, and it is mainly due to this denominator 1 + n 1 that the critical number
of fermion avors nc is large.

secondly, the existence of an uv xed point for a specic number of fermion
avors n depends on the interplay between the functions 1 and 3, which are given
in terms of integrals of the functions g1 and g3. let us recall that the lowest order
chebyshev expansion for g1, eq. (5.47) is a lower bound on g1 of eq. (5.46), since
all terms of the chebyshev expansion are positive at k2 = p2, the same cannot be
said about g3 of eq. (5.74). thus keeping more terms in the chebyshev expansion
leads to an increase of 1, whereas the eect on 3 is less clear, because of the
alternating chebyshev series for 3. therefore, an improvement of the computation
of 1 will most likely lead to a decrease of the critical avor number nc.

moreover in computation of the functions 1 and 3 we have used yukawa ver-
tices (s) and  and  propagators (s) which were obtained in the quenched-
ladder approximation. it is an interesting question, whether the improvement of
the ladder approximation for the gauge interaction (e.g. by including crossed photon
exchanges) leads to a increase of 1, and thus a decrease of nc.

finally, we recall that we have neglected the eect of the yukawa vertex function
f2 (eq. (4.7)), but clearly the inclusion of f2 in the analysis could change the results
quantitatively. whether such an improvement will tend to increase or decrease nc
remains unclear at this stage.

5.8.1 close to the njl point

let us analyze the interplay between 1 and 3 in more detail close to the pure
njl point (i.e.
for small values of 0) by expanding these functions in 0. the
computation of the lowest order terms in 0 of eqs. (5.60) and (5.80) is laborious
but straightforward, therefore we mention just the nal results:

this nc is slightly smaller than the critical number nc  54, which was obtained
graphically from fig. 5.4. the value of the root x at this critical number nc is

x  6.32131 = 0  0.146.

summarizing, we nd, that for n > nc  45 uv xed points 0 (0 < 0.146) are
obtained. moreover, with the identication eq. (5.90), y = g2

that 1 is of order 0 the inequality (5.16) is satised for 0 suciently small.

relevant four-fermion interactions in four dimensions are possible at the chiral phase
transition in the gnjl model. the main objective of this chapter was to study the
eect of such relevant four-fermion dynamics on the vacuum polarization and to
reinvestigate the problem of triviality of u (1) gauge theories.

to obtain new results, the four-fermion interactions had to be incorporated
beyond the commonly used hartreefock or mean-eld approach. at the chiral

5.9 discussion

phase transition (e.g. the critical curve eq. (3.46)) in the quenched gnjl model,
the appearance of a large anomalous dimension is believed to turn naively irrelevant
interactions into relevant ones.

the crucial feature of the gnjl model is that a nontrivial yukawa interaction
(i.e. an interaction between (pseudo)scalars and fermions) exists for 0 < 0 < c.
the existence of such a nontrivial yukawa interaction requires the cancellation of
z factors6 in fermionanti-fermion scattering amplitudes such as the bs kernel
k (2), and is analogous to the requirement of hyperscaling (see section 3.5). if the
hyperscaling equations are satised, then only two of the critical exponents are
independent, namely  and , with

(5.103)

 = 1,

 = 2(1  ),

 =p1  0/c,

see eqs. (3.60) and (4.111). we recall that the anomalous dimension  is dened
at the critical point, whereas  describes scaling in the neighborhood of the critical
point.7

the skeleton expansion for the bs kernel k (2) provides a natural framework to
take into account the anomalous dimension of yukawa vertices and  and  propa-
gators. within the skeleton expansion,  and  exchanges are described in terms of
fully dressed yukawa vertices and  and  propagators. the actual computation of
the anomalous dimension, and the resolution of the scaling form requires a solution
of the sdes for yukawa vertices, and  and  bosons.

in previous work such fully dressed yukawa vertices and  and  propagators
have been analized in the quenched-ladder approximation, see chapter 4, ref. [40],
and references therein. to make use of these results consistently, we used the
following approximations. firstly, we assumed that all dynamics takes place in
in that case, the quenched
a region close to an uv xed point, (0)  0.
approximation is self-consistent. secondly, the gauge-interaction is considered in
the ladder form, with bare vertices. thirdly, we used the 1/n expansion (with
n the number of fermion avors) which states that planar  and  exchanges
describe the leading contribution to green functions for large n . then, due to
the specic form of the chiral symmetry with both scalars and pseudoscalar in
the adjoint representation, we argued that in so-called zero-spin channels (such as
yukawa vertices and  and  propagators) the planar  and  exchanges cancel
each other for momenta larger than the inverse correlation length (in fact in the
symmetric phase this cancellation is exact). the inverse correlation length in the
gnjl model is the mass of the  boson, 1 = m. moreover, an important
property of the planar (ladder) approximations is that such truncations respect the
vector and chiral wardtakahashi identities.

6the z factor is the wave function renormalization constant of the  and  elds.
7these values of the critical exponents are in rather good agreement with lattice simulations,
and results obtained by nonperturbative rg techniques, see the discussions in sections 3.8 and
3.9.

140

on the existence of ultra-violet xed points

the so-called jwb method [46], which is a nonperturbative framework indepen-
dent of the fermion wave function z, allowed us to compute the contributions of the
innite set of planar  and  exchanges to the vacuum polarization. the result of
the computations is that the gnjl model exhibits an uv xed point, (0) = 0,
for any value of n that exceeds some critical value nc (n > nc). this critical
number of avors turned out to be nc  54. the larger the number of fermion
avors, the smaller the uv xed point 0 will be, provided n > nc.

the large value for nc puts questions to the applicability of the gnjl. however,
we have given a few arguments in the previous section suggesting that nc could be
rather sensitive to approximations, and that an improvement of the approximations
and calculations will probably lead to a smaller value for nc.

the mechanism responsible for the realization of an uv xed point is illustrated
by the observation that contributions of planar  and  exchanges to the vacuum
polarization have identical sign, and tend to reduce screening. the four-fermion
interactions describe attractive forces between virtual fermionanti-fermion pairs in
the vacuum polarization.

the conventional leading term in the vacuum polarization is the one-loop cor-
rection describing the creation of fermionanti-fermion pairs. these virtual pairs
can be considered as dipoles causing the screening; the vacuum is a medium of
the insulator type. such a screening is proportional to the coupling 0 and pro-
portional to the number of fermion avors n . however, if a particular fraction of
the total amount of fermionanti-fermion pairs created are correlated by attrac-
tive four-fermion interactions, represented by  and  exchanges, then clearly these
composite neutral states are not capable of screening. thus the negative term n 1
in the  function (5.83) represents the contributions and the attractive nature of
four-fermion interactions in the vacuum polarization.

it is known that in the quenched approximation, the critical curve and critical
exponents are independent of the number of fermion avors. in the quenched-ladder
approximation using the mean-eld approach for the four-fermion interactions it is
straightforward to derive that this is indeed the case. clearly, the mechanism of
charge screening is avor dependent, since the total number of virtual fermionanti-
fermion pairs is proportional to n and the total number of composite scalars and
pseudoscalars grows as 2n 2. the larger the number of avors, the stronger the
eect of four-fermion interactions. the xed point appears when the virtual pairs
completely loose the ability to screen.

the existence of an uv xed point implies a nontrivial continuum limit of the
gnjl model with a u (1) gauge interaction. the analysis presented here suggest
that in the full unquenched gnjl model the critical line is replaced by an uv xed
point somewhere on the critical line depending on the number of fermion avors. if
the number of fermion avors is below some specic value, the critical four-fermion
dynamics are not sucient to yield an uv xed point. in that case the unquenched
gnjl model only has a trivial (ir) xed point.

5.9 discussion

141

finally, let us briey compare our results with that obtained by lattice simula-
tions and nonperturbative rg techniques. although there still is some controversy
between dierent groups performing lattice computations, the standard conclusion
of the desy group (gockeler et al.) is that qed is trivial and that the chiral phase
transition is of the mean eld type. our results agree with these conclusions for
n < nc.

using nonperturbative rg techniques, it was found in refs. [41, 134], that within
a particular local potential approach the gauge coupling 0 in gnjl model is
trivial. again for n < nc the results agree. however, for large n , we think that,
in order to compare such type of approaches with our results, the rg ows of
operators corresponding to the dynamical nature of  and  exchanges should be
taken into account. in the context of nprg techniques, we think this probably
involves taking into account higher (than 6) dimensional chiral invariant operators
containing derivatives, such as (( ))2.

course the symmetry only applies when the (bare) mass matrix m vanishes. the

green functions,
propagators, and proper
vertices

in this appendix we dene the green function, connected green functions both
in coordinate and momentum space, and we dene the propagators and proper
vertices of the gnjl model. the fermion elds are labeled with a dirac index (rst
subscript a, b, c, d) and a avor index (second subscript f, i, j, l, k). the scalar and
pseudoscalar elds are labeled with avor indices  and . spinor indies run from 1
to 4, fermion avor indices from 1 to n and scalar resp. pseudoscalar indices from
0 to n 2  1.

in what follows j represents the set of sources j = (j, , , j, j).

b.1 green functions of the gnjl model

the green function are dened as time order vacuum-to-vacuum expectation values
of the elds. first we dene the appropriate one-point green functions:

appendix d

analysis of the chebyshev
expansion

in this appendix we discuss the validity of the zeroth-order chebyshev expansion for
the yukawa vertex function f1 introduced in section 4.2. the problem of angular
dependence in the sdes for the yukawa vertex functions f1 and f2 is replaced by
an innite set of chebyshev harmonics. subsequently this set is truncated to the
lowest order harmonic of f1, which is the only harmonic having nonhomogeneous ul-
traviolet boundary conditions because of the presence of the (angular independent)
inhomogeneous term 1.

as mentioned previously, the method of using expansions in terms of chebyshev
polynomials un(x) (of the second kind) was used before [10, 164, 165]. these

polynomials are orthogonal with respect to the angular integration r d. in the

analysis of bses in ref. [10] a cp invariant chebyshev expansion was used, which
has the nice property of keeping only even terms in the expansion. however, we use a
slightly dierent expansion (not explicitly cp invariant) which has the disadvantage
of also including odd terms in the chebyshev expansion, but the advantages that the
integral equation for the zeroth order harmonic is more friendly and the zeroth
order harmonic coincides with both the large fermion momentum limit (p2  q2) as
well the large boson-momentum limit (q2  p2) of the yukawa vertex, see fig. 4.4.
thus the vertex functions satisfying the sdes (4.8) are expanded in the angle
between fermion momentum p and scalar boson q, i.e., p  q, in the following way:

f1(p + q, p) =

f2(p + q, p) =

fn(p2, q2)un(cos ),

gn(p2, q2)un(cos ),

(d.20)

in principle there is an equivalent set of equations for the coecients gn of f2.
however we did not succeed in nding explicit expression for these, due to our
inability to compute explicitly the angular integrals given by kernels k21 and k22
of eqs. (4.11) and(4.12). the problem is to compute the integrals

22 z dr
z dp

22 un(cos )k21(p, q, r),

z dp
22 z dq

22 un(cos )k21(p, q, r).(d.21)

the main approximation used in chapter 4 is eq. (4.22), i.e. the replacement of
the yukawa vertex by the zeroth-order harmonic of f1. in what follows we estimate
the error made by such an approximation. we dene the error e(q2) in computation
of the scalar vacuum polarization eq. (d.13) as follows:

s(q2) =

1
42

2

z0

where

dk2 a0(k2, q2)f0(k2, q2) + e(q2),

dk2 " 
xn=1

bn(k2, q2)gn(k2, q2)# . (d.23)
for an estimation of e(q2) we need to know more about the harmonics fn, n  1,
and gn, n  0. the solution to these harmonics is assumed to be governed by
the harmonic f0 only, since the integral over the harmonic f0 acts as the largest
inhomogeneous term in the integral equations for the higher order harmonics. so
the equations for the higher order harmonics are approximated by



xn=0

gn(p2, q2)  0

22 un(cos )k21(p, q, r)f0(r2, q2), (d.24)

unfortunately there is no explicit expression for eq. (d.24) for the reason described
above. however it is possible to approximate the angular average by considering
either one of the three momenta in k21(p, q, r) to be much smaller than the other
two. then the dependence on one of the three angles between the momenta is lost,

and the integration can be performed explicitly. the result for the lowest harmonic
of f2, i.e., g0 given by eq. (d.24), is

where s = p2, t = q2, and we have used eq. (4.23). these equations can be
analyzed in detail once the solutions for the channel functions, eqs. (4.46) and
(4.47), are known. but for obtaining the asymptotic behavior of the harmonics g0
and f1 it is sucient to use the asymptotics of the channels, i.e., take fir(p2, q2) 
fir(0, q2)  (q2/2)/21/2, fuv(p2, q2)  fuv(p2, 0)  (p2/2)/21/2. this
gives for the harmonics

and we assume a similar relation to hold between the harmonics gn+1 and gn. thus
the series



s(p2, q2) 

xm=0(cid:2)am(p2, q2)fm(p2, q2) + bm(p2, q2)gm(p2, q2)(cid:3) ,

(d.33)

which occurs both in the equation for f0, eq. (d.18), and for s, eq. (d.13), will
be rapidly converging for either p2  q2 or p2  q2, since

an+1(p2, q2)fn+1(p2, q2)

an(p2, q2)fn(p2, q2)

(d.34)

and again a similar equation for the part containing the harmonics gn. at p2 = q2
only three terms of the series s, eq. (d.33), contribute, since an(p2, p2) = 0 for
n  1 and bn(p2, p2) = 0 for n  2. hence, a straightforward approximation for the
series s is

s(p2, q2)  a0(p2, q2)f0(p2, q2)

+ o(cid:0)a1(p2, q2)f1(p2, q2)(cid:1) + o(cid:0)b0(p2, q2)g0(p2, q2)(cid:1) ,

(d.35)

supporting eq. (4.22). with the expressions obtained for f1 and g0, eqs. (d.30)
and (d.31), the leading term of the error e dened in eq. (d.23) can be estimated.

where we have kept only leading terms and for fuv(p2, 0) = f1(p, p) given by

eq. (4.48). recall that  = 1  40. the estimation of eq. (d.36) can be checked

more explicitly by using the solutions obtained in section 4.2 for the channel func-
tions fir, fuv, eqs. (4.46) and (4.47).

161

eq. (d.36) shows that when 0 = 0,  = 1, the error e vanishes, and when
 < 1 clearly the terms in the error can be neglected with respect to the rst two
terms on the right-hand side of s(q2), see eq. (4.64). thus this analysis supports
the assumption eq. (4.22) made in section 4.2 and the error e contributes only to
next-to-next-to-leading order in q2/2. and therefore we may conclude that our
approximation gives correct leading and next-to-leading behavior of s(q2).

in this appendix we compute two-loop vacuum polarization corrections including 
and  exchanges.

e.1 two-loop vacuum polarization

in this section, we compute the two-loop vacuum polarization in qed. we derive
the two-loop contribution by making use of the one-loop computation of the photon-
fermion vertex [69, 70].

the sde for vacuum polarization tensor reads

 (q2) = ie2

d4k
(2)4 tr [s(k + q) (k + q, k)s(k)] .

(e.1)

assuming that the wtis are respected, the vacuum polarization tensor is trans-

if so, we nd that

let us write and denote the one-loop vertex and self-energy corrections with a
subscript (1) as follows

(k, p) =  +

(e.9)

where q2 is an euclidean momentum. the quadratically divergent contribution
2/q2 is a notorious artifact of computing vacuum polarization corrections in the
presence of a hard cuto (i.e. an explicit cuto in the momentum integrations
instead of paulivillars regularization, see for a recent discussion ref. [59]). the
quadratically divergent term is proportional to the g tensor in the vacuum polar-
ization tensor, and it ruins the transversality of  . this cuto problem can be
circumvented by making use of a projector g  4qq/q2, which by contraction
with the vacuum polarization tensor eliminates the term in  proportional to the
g tensor. with such a projector we obtain

(1)(q2) =

0

3 (cid:20)log(cid:18) 2

q2(cid:19) + o(1)(cid:21) ,

which is the well-known one-loop vacuum polarization.

we write


(1)(k, p) = 

l(1)(k, p) + 

r(1)(k, p) + 

i(1)(k, p),

(e.10)

(e.11)

where 

i(1) are one-loop transverse parts:

l(1) is the one-loop longitudinal part of the vertex, and where r(1) and

r(1)(k, p) = t 

i(1)(k, p) = t

(e.16)

by construction, the ballchiu expression for the longitudinal vertex satises the
wti

q

l(1)(k, p) = kz(1)(k2) + pz(1)(p2).

for qed, the one-loop vertex and self-energy corrections are

in the feynman gauge.

how can one compute the contributions given in eq. (e.15)? since the one-loop
transverse vertex functions themselves are nite, i.e. these function are independent
of the cut-o , the leading logarithmic contributions to the vacuum polarization
result from integrations over momenta k2  q2 in (2r) and (2i). these leading
logarithmic contribution can be found by rst deriving the k2  q2 asymptotic be-
havior of the transverse structure functions, after which the integration over angles
can be performed. in the feynman gauge  = 1, the asymptotic behavior k2  q2
of the  s is

the integrations over momenta k2  q2 leads to logarithmic corrections. let us
give an example, and compute, in this way, (2r). after evaluating the trace in
eq. (e.15) (with j = r), and wick rotating to euclidean momenta, the expression
for (2r) reads

(e.25)

an analogous computation can be performed for the self-energy and longitudinal

vertex corrections.

due to the ballchiu expression (e.16) for 

l(1), the contributions (2a) and
(2l) depend on the one-loop computation of the self-energy z(1). since we have
chosen w to be the photon momentum in eq. (e.19), we nd that

z(1)(p2) =

and using that z(1)((k + q)2)  z(1)(q2) for q2  k2, the angular integration can
be performed, and the logarithmic corrections can be computed. the result is
q2(cid:19) + o(1)(cid:21) . (e.28)

thus, comparing this expression with eq. (e.25), we see that the overlapping
divergencies (i.e. the log2) cancel

(2a)(q2) + (2l)(q2) + (2i)(q2)  (2

0/2)o(1).

(e.29)

such a cancellation occurs in a similar manner in any covariant gauge . thus,
the two-loop contribution contribution to  is described solely by the part of the
transverse vertex containing the t 
8 tensor, i.e. (2r), and, after adding all the
pieces, we nd that

(e.30)

as was shown in [70], the particular transverse structure function 8 does not depend
on the gauge parameter . this observation agrees with the jbw computation of
vacuum polarization eects.

e.2 scalar and pseudoscalar contributions

the two-loop contributions of scalars and pseudoscalars to the vacuum polarization
can be computed rather easily by making use of the results of the previous section.
besides the photon exchange, we now take into account also scalar and pseudoscalar
exchanges in the one-loop vertex, and self-energy dened in eq. (e.4), i.e.,


(1)(k, p) = 
pz(1)(p2) = (v )(p)  (s)(p)  (p )(p).

the vertex part r is dened so that it is proportional to the transverse vertex
with the t 

8 tensor:

2e2

0r(k, p) = 

r(1)(k, p) = 8(k2, p2, q2)t

q2 = (k  p)2.

(e.46)

e.3 perturbative four-fermionic contributions

169

thus we see that the part of eq. (e.44), that is proportional to 
r(1), and which
turned out to be responsible for the two-loop contribution to the vacuum polar-
ization, has a dierence in sign between terms corresponding to photon exchanges,
and terms corresponding to (pseudo)scalar exchanges.

clearly the vertex part s must be

2e2

0s(k, p) = 

l(1)(k, p) + 

i(1)(k, p),

(e.48)

l(1) and 

with 
r(1), and 
the contributions of (v ), 
eqs. (e.28), (e.25), and (e.24), we deduce that

i(1) given by eqs. (e.16) and (e.13). since we already computed
i(1) to the vacuum polarization in

.

(e.49)

(e.50)

so from the point of view of two-loop correction to the vacuum polarization, the
negative sign of the scalar and pseudoscalar interactions in eq. (e.49) suggests that
these type of interactions tend to reduce the screening, i.e. represents the attractive
nature of forces between virtual fermion pairs in the vacuum polarization.

e.3 perturbative four-fermionic contributions

in this section, we compute the two-loop contributions of four-fermion interactions
to the vacuum polarization. the four-fermion interactions are treated in a pertur-
bation expansion in the dimensionless four-fermion coupling g0 dened in eq. (3.6).
then in the lowest order approximation, the  and  exchanges corresponding to
the four-fermion interactions are described by the bare or free propagators

s(q) = p(q) = g0.

(e.51)

with such  and  propagators, the one-loop vertex and self-energy corrections are
given by



(1)(k, p) = ig0z

again it is useful to decompose the one-loop vertex into transverse and longitu-

dinal parts, just as in eq. (e.11). the result is

i(1)(k, p) =

where g0 = 42g0/2. with the one-loop vertex and self-energy corrections given

from eqs. (e.7), (e.10), (e.15), and (e.66) that:

 (cid:20)

log(cid:18) 2

q2(cid:19) + o(1)(cid:21) . (e.67)

the contributions of the one-loop transverse vertex parts to the vacuum polarization
can be performed exactly, since the angular integral can be done, the result is

(2i)(q2) =

hence

0g0

(e.69)

and the four-fermion interaction treated in a perturbative way do not give contri-
butions to the  function. thus again in this case too, the contributions of the
longitudinal vertex cancel the contributions of the transverse vertex part which are
proportional to the t 
3 tensor. in this case, however, the transverse part connected
with t 

8 does not give a logarithmic contribution to screening.

the four-fermion interactions treated in a perturbative way are irrelevant, and,
according to the rg of wilson, these interactions do not contribute to the low-
energy eective dynamics such as charge screening.

two-loop vacuum polarization

appendix f

a derivation of the jwb
equation

in this appendix we review the derivation of equation (5.27) for the f function given
by eq. (5.26) (and thus the  function) of qed introduced by johnson, willey, and
baker [46]. since their result is formulated in terms of the bs fermion-fermion
scattering kernel k (2) their method is also applicable to the gnjl model.

in order to derive the jwb result, the following is assumed:

 the fermion wave function equals one, z = 1/a = 1, in the landau gauge. in
principle, this assumption is redundant since the jwb result is valid in any
gauge, as long as the wti is satised.

 the quenched approximation is assumed to be consistent. internal photon
propagators are quenched. only a single fermion loop, thus a single power
of log  contributes to the vacuum polarization. such an approximation is
assumed to be valid close to an ultraviolet xed point.

 translational invariance of naively logarithmically divergent and nite mo-
mentum space integrals is assumed. this is an important point, since such
translational invariance is lost in naively linear divergent integrals, such a the
integral in the sde for the fermion wave function z.

 also it is assumed that we are in the scaling region of the theory, where the
only relevant dimensionless variable is q2/2. thus the momenta are assumed
to be larger than the particle masses or bound states masses in the model.

hence,

z(k2) = 1/a(k2) = 1,

assuming that k (2) is translationally invariant, we can derive the following prop-
erties:

z d4p tr [l(p)k(p, k)r(k)] = z d4p tr [r(k)k(k, p)l(p)] ,
z d4p tr [l(p)k(p, k)r(k)] = z d4p tr [r(k)k(k, p)l(p)] ,
z d4p tr [l(p)k

a derivation of the jwb equation

in fact, eq. (f.38) is the main result of [46]. the entire derivation did not yet
specify the bs kernel k (2), and the jwb equation is applicable to the gnjl model
as well. the crucial approximation is that internal gauge bosons are taken to be
quenched, i.e., d(p) = (g + pp/p2)/p2, which is considered to be reasonable
near a xed point.

samenvatting

in dit proefschrift wordt het gauged nambujona-lasinio (gnjl) model behan-
deld. het gnjl model is een quantumvelden-theoretisch model voor dynami-
sche chirale symmetriebreking. de begrippen chirale symmetrie en chirale sym-
metriebreking worden gebruikt in de hoge energie fysica. chirale symmetriebreking
verschaft een mechanisme om massas van elementaire deeltjes (zoals bijv. het elek-
tron, quarks, neutrinos (?)) te genereren.

in de jaren dertig en veertig bleek dat voor het modelleren van het gedrag van een
elementair deeltje, zoals het elektron, zowel een quantummechanische beschrijving
als een relativistische beschrijving nodig was. dit heeft aanleiding gegeven tot de
quantumvelden-theorie. in de jaren zeventig zijn de quantum-velden-theoretische
modellen van de electromagnetische, de zwakke en de sterke wisselwerking verenigd
in het standaard model. het standaard model beschrijft de interacties tussen de
elementaire deeltjes (elementair voor zover we dat experimenteel kunnen testen)
in termen van zogenaamde ijktheorieen. deze ijktheorieen hebben een bijzondere
eigenschap die renormaliseerbaarheid wordt genoemd en die hen toepasbaar maakt
over een heel groot energiegebied.

een van de vraagstukken in de natuurkunde is de oorsprong van de massas van
de elementaire deeltjes en hun verscheidenheid. deze massas volgen niet uit het
standaard model. hoewel hierover veel ideeen zijn, bestaat er nog geen succesvol
model waarmee de massas berekend kunnen worden. het enige dat we nu kunnen is
de massas van de elementaire deeltjes meten met behulp van deeltjesversnellers en
de gemeten waarden gebruiken als uitgangspunt in specieke modellen. om massas
aan elementaire deeltjes toe te kennen gebruiken we in het standaard model het
zogenaamde higgs mechanisme. dit higgs mechanisme voorspelt tevens het bestaan
van een higgs boson, een deeltje dat nog niet is waargenomen.

de wiskundige formulering van quantumvelden-theorieen is erg ingewikkeld, en
niet compleet. de interessantste en fysisch meest relevante modellen leiden tot een
oneindig groot systeem van gekoppelde bewegingsvergelijkingen. deze worden ook
wel schwingerdyson vergelijkingen genoemd. dergelijke vergelijkingen zijn prak-
tisch onoplosbaar en dus zijn we gedwongen benaderingen te ontwikkelen waarmee
we iets concreets kunnen uitrekenen.

samenvatting

het standaard model is erg succesvol. dat hebben we te danken aan het feit
dat de koppelingsconstanten (die de sterkte van de fundamentele natuurkrachten
weergeven) in de meeste gevallen vrij klein zijn. daardoor kunnen we gebruik maken
van een expansietechniek die storingstheorie heet.

een direct gevolg van renormalisatie is dat koppelingsconstanten energie-afhan-
kelijk zijn. zo hangt de sterkte van een bepaalde interactie tussen deeltjes af van
de afstand tussen die deeltjes. meestal is het zo dat een interactie vrij zwak is voor
lange afstanden en sterker wordt naarmate de afstand tussen de deeltjes kleiner
wordt (het omgekeerde is ook mogelijk). een aantal fysische verschijnselen is het
gevolg van een sterke wisselwerking tussen deeltjes, en kan dus niet, i.v.m. grote
koppelingsconstanten, met storingstheorie beschreven worden. voorbeelden hiervan
zijn massageneratie en de formatie van gebonden toestanden zoals hadronen. deze
hadronen zijn gebonden toestanden van twee of drie quarks. de sterke wisselwerking
tussen quarks wordt beschreven door qcd (quantumchromodynamica). hoewel we
denken dat qcd de juiste theorie is voor de dynamica van quarks is het erg moeilijk
om uit qcd de hadronen te herleiden.

zulke niet-storingsachtige fenomenen gaan vaak samen met het optreden van
een faseovergang in het model als functie van de koppelingsconstante. als de kop-
pelingsconstante boven een bepaalde critische waarde komt, ontstaan gebonden toe-
standen van fermionen en wordt een massa gegenereerd (dit is dynamische chirale
symmetriebreking). dergelijke chirale faseovergangen hebben veel overeenkomsten
met faseovergangen in modellen voor bijvoorbeeld ferromagnetisme in de statistis-
che mechanica.

wat het gnjl model interessant maakt is het feit dat een combinatie van vol-
doend sterke en attractieve vier-fermion interacties en een zogenaamde abelse ijkin-
teractie1 zon chirale faseovergang veroorzaakt. de faseovergang hangt samen met
de formatie van gebonden toestanden en massageneratie. het blijkt dat de gebonden
toestanden in het gnjl model veel compacter zijn en sterker gebonden dan in qcd.
dit suggereert dat de gebonden toestanden relevant zijn voor de beschrijving van de
dynamica van de fermionen over een heel groot energiegebied. technisch gesproken
betekent dit dat de vier-fermion interactie renormaliseerbaar is; de dracht van de
vier-fermion interacties is veel langer dan op grond van storingstheorie berekend
kan worden.

het gnjl model zegt daarom veel over de mogelijke rol die vier-fermion inter-

acties kunnen spelen voor het modelleren van massas van elementaire deeltjes.

hieronder volgt een korte samenvatting per hoofdstuk.

hoofdstuk 1. hierin introduceren we het pad-integraal formalisme en de daaraan
gerelateerde schwingerdyson vergelijking. de renormalisatiegroep-methode wordt
uitvoerig behandeld en de connectie tussen faseovergangen in statische mechanische
modellen en de renormalisatie van quantumvelden theorieen wordt gemaakt. aan

1dit in tegenstelling tot qcd dat gebaseerd is op een niet-abelse ijktheorie.

189

het eind introduceren we het goldstone mechanisme en de lagrangeaan van het
gnjl model.

hoofdstuk 2. dit hoofdstuk is een noodzakelijk kwaad en nogal technisch van
aard. de schwingerdyson vergelijkingen voor een aantal specieke green functies
(correlaties functies) worden afgeleid. ook worden de zogeheten wardtakahashi
identiteiten behandeld. dit zijn vergelijkingen die de symmetrieen van het model
representeren en uitermate belangrijk zijn in het bepalen van een geloofwaardige be-
naderingsmethode. de wardtakahashi identiteiten zijn het centrale uitgangspunt
voor het formuleren van niet-storingsachtige benaderingen.

hoofdstuk 3.
in hoofdstuk 3 worden een aantal specieke niet-storingsachtige
benaderingen gentroduceerd en onder de loep genomen: de ladder benadering,
de quenched benadering en de mean-eld (hartreefock) benadering voor de
schwingerdyson vergelijking (de gap-vergelijking) voor de massa van het fermion
in het gnjl model. de basiseigenschappen van de chirale faseovergang die de
gap-vergelijking beschrijft worden behandeld. de resultaten van deze specieke
benaderingen worden vergeleken met andere niet-storingsachtige technieken zoals
numerieke roostersimulaties en niet-storingsachtige renormalisatiegroep technieken.
hoewel dit hoofdstuk geen nieuwe resultaten beschrijft, geeft het een overzicht van
de literatuur en vormt het een raamwerk voor het begrijpen van hoofdstuk 4 en 5.

hoofdstuk 4. dit hoofdstuk is gewijd aan het berekenen van de yukawa vertex
en de scalaire instabiele gebonden toestanden (resonanties) in de quenched ladder
benadering.

we ontwikkelen een methode waarmee we analytische uitdrukkingen kunnen
vinden voor de yukawa-vertex en de scalaire propagator die deze resonantie repre-
senteert. de scalaire propagator is te beschouwen als een soort higgs deeltje. de
yukawa vertex beschrijft de interactie tussen fermionen en gebonden toestanden en
is een functie van de impulsen van de ingaande fermionen en de uitgaande gebonden
toestand.

de resultaten worden uitvoerig vergeleken met resultaten van andere auteurs.
het nieuwe aan onze berekeningen is dat het impuls gedrag van de yukawa-vertex
wordt uitgebreid en dat het fasediagram uitvoeriger wordt behandeld dan in eerdere
studies. een van de conclusies die uit hoofdstuk 4 getrokken kan worden is het feit
dat de hartreefock benadering voor vier-fermion interacties in het gnjl model
in het algemeen inconsistent is.

hoofdstuk 5.
in dit hoofdstuk wordt de continuum limiet behandeld. dit komt
er kortweg op neer dat we onderzoeken of het gnjl model een niet-triviale renor-
maliseerbare theorie is. de vier-fermion interacties worden nu benaderd in een 1/n

190

samenvatting

expansie2 in plaats van de hartreefock benadering.

gekeken wordt naar de vacuumpolarisatie. dat is een functie die de eectieve
koppelingscontante oftewel de eectieve lading van de fermionen beschrijft. uitein-
delijk bepaalt het gedrag van de vacuumpolarisatie of het gnjl model een niet-
triviaal renormaliseerbaar model is. de vacuumpolarisatie is een functie van zowel
de yukawa-vertex als de scalaire propagator waarvoor we in hoofdstuk 4 expliciete
uitdrukkingen hebben afgeleid.

conclusie. het doel van dit proefschrift was om het sterke koppelingsgedrag en
de chirale faseovergang in het gnjl model beter te begrijpen en de conclusie van dit
proefschrift kan als volgt worden samengevat. we hebben aangetoond binnen het
kader van een aantal niet-storingsachtige benaderingen (nl. de ladder benadering en
de 1/n expansie) dat het gnjl model een niet-triviale renormaliseerbare theorie is,
in de buurt van de chirale faseovergang, mits het aantal typen fermionen (aangeduid
met n ) groter is dan een critische waarde (nc).

deze critische waarde is nogal groot (nc  50), en is veel groter dan het aan-
tal typen fermionen dat tot nu toe bekend is. daarom is er wat dat betreft nog
geen directe toepassing voor het model. toch is het resultaat belangrijk omdat
de enige tot nu bekende niet-triviale renormaliseerbare theorieen gebaseerd zijn op
niet-abelse ijktheorieen terwijl het door ons beschouwde gnjl model is gebaseerd
op een abelse ijktheorie.
