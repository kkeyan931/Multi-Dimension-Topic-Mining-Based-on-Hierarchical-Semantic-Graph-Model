abstract

we present the action for a self-dual tensor in six dimensions, cou-
pled to a (2, 0) conformal supergravity background. this action
gives rise to the expected equations of motion. an alternative
look upon one of the gauge symmetries claries its role in the
supersymmetry transformation rules and the realization of the
algebra.

1 introduction

the description of chiral bosons, antisymmetric 2p-forms in 4p + 2 dimen-
sions with (anti)self-dual eld strengths, in terms of an action has been a
longstanding problem. this was caused by the rst order self-duality con-
dition.
in 6 dimensions, the chiral boson is a (anti)self-dual two-tensor.
by giving up explicit lorentz invariance, it became possible to construct a
new class of actions [1, 2]. in [2], six-dimensional actions were constructed
with manifestly ve-dimensional lorentz invariance. a non-trivial check was
needed to prove six-dimensional covariance.

the construction of a manifestly lorentz invariant action has been estab-
lished by introducing one auxiliary scalar eld and two extra gauge symme-
tries in [3]. this auxiliary eld appears non-polynomially in the action and
in the two new local gauge symmetries. these bosonic symmetries make it
possible to gauge away the new scalar eld and reduce the number of degrees
of freedom of the tensor. the gauge xing of these symmetries in the bosonic
model is studied in [4].

in [5] was proven that this lorentz invariant action with a suitable gauge
xing (choosing a xed direction for the derivative of the scalar) gives rise
to the conjectured feynman rules and the gravitational anomalies as in [6].
self-dual tensors also appear in a supersymmetric context. depending on
the amount of chiral supersymmetry in six dimensions, the supersymmetric
tensor multiplet contains a (anti)self-dual tensor, 2 or 4 chiral spinors and
one or ve scalars. in [7] is proven that the action for the rigid (2, 0) tensor
multiplet is invariant under rigid superconformal symmetry. the geometrical
superspace treatment of the self-dual tensor multiplet is developed in [8].

the eld equations for the m5-brane [9, 10, 11] also contain a self-dual
tensor. the worldvolume action is constructed in [9]. the wz-term and the
relation to the rigid superconformal model appeared in [7]. up to now, a
model for interacting self-dual tensor multiplets is lacking. in [12] is proven
that this will not be a local interacting quantum eld theory. the supercon-
formal theory for a stack of n coinciding m5-branes would be relevant for
the ads7/cft6 version of the maldacena conjecture. some partial results
can be found for instance in [13].

self-dual tensors appear naturally in string theory compactications, for
instance compactications of type i string theory on k3 [14], of the heterotic
string on k3 [15] and of m-theory on k3s1/z2 [16] in the (1, 0) context and
compactications of type iib on k3 [17] with (2, 0) supersymmetry in six

1

dimensions. the (anti)self-dual tensors appear in two ways in gravitational
theories. first, they are one of the components of the gravitational multiplet
in poincare [18, 19] and conformal [20, 21] chiral supergravities in six dimen-
sions. the rigidly supersymmetric tensor multiplets can also be realized as
matter multiplets in a supergravity background. in [22], the poincare actions
for the multiplets with self-dual tensors were constructed. the most general
coupling of matter multiplets in chiral theories with one supersymmetry can
be found in [24]. these chiral theories are anomalous. the (2, 0)-theory is
anomaly-free when 21 tensor multiplets are coupled to supergravity [25].

by using superconformal techniques [26], the eld equations for the self-
dual tensor multiplet coupled to a (1, 0) and a (2, 0) conformal supergravity
background were derived in [20] and [21].
in [21], the gauge-xing of the
relevant superconformal symmetries to end up with super-poincare symme-
try, was done and the description to go from the eld equations of the tensor
multiplet with (2, 0) to those with (1, 0) superconformal symmetry was given.
the aim of this paper is to give the action for the self-dual tensor multi-
plet, coupled to conformal (2, 0) supergravity. the consistency of the action
is checked by the derivation of the eld equations of [21]. we give the trans-
formation rules of the tensor multiplet that do not use the self-duality condi-
tion. these transformation rules are understood better by looking upon the
rst new symmetry as a gauge symmetry with the derivative of the auxiliary
scalar as its gauge eld. we also indicate how the algebra is changed when
these transformation rules for the tensor multiplet are used and the new
gauge symmetries are introduced. the transformation rules of the equations
of motion are given.

the paper is organized as follows. in section 2, the eld content of the
weyl multiplet is given. the (2, 0) tensor multiplet, its superconformal trans-
formation rules and its gauge transformation with respect to the new gauge
symmetries are studied. therefore, the auxiliary scalar eld a is introduced.
all the three gauge symmetries play a specic role in the algebra. in sec-
tion 3, the action and a sketch of the proof of its invariance under gauge
and superconformal symmetry is given. this action gives rise to the eld
equations of [21]. their (special) supersymmetry transformation rules are
given. the last section contains the conclusions.

2 (2, 0) superconformal multiplets

in this section, the superconformal gravitational multiplet and the self-dual
tensor multiplet are introduced1. the new gauge symmetries, essential to
write down an action, are dened. the role of the new symmetries in the
transformation rules and the algebra is claried.

the (2, 0) superconformal gravitational multiplet is a representation of
osp(8|4) [7]. the usual superconformal tensor calculus approach is fol-
lowed to construct the weyl multiplet:
introducing gauge elds for all the
superconformal symmetries, constructing curvatures, imposing conventional
constraints and introducing matter elds. the weyl multiplet then contains
gauge elds and matter elds. e
 and b are gauge elds for general
coordinate transformations, supersymmetry, usp(4) r-symmetry and dilata-
a for special conformal
tions. the gauge elds 
transformations and i
 for special supersymmetry are composite elds by the
three conventional constraints. together with the matter elds, ve antiself-
dual tensors t ij
jk and fourteen scalars in dij,kl, they
give rise to 128 + 128 degrees of freedom.

there is only one matter multiplet in the chiral (2, 0) theory: a self-
dual tensor multiplet2. it contains a self-dual tensor b with three degrees
of freedom, a set of four symplectic majorana-weyl fermions i and ve
scalars ij. some properties of these elds are summarized in table 1. in the
denition of the fermions and the scalars, we made use of ij, the usp(4)-
metric. usp(4)-indices are moved up and down using this metric as follows:

i = ijj ,

i = jij .

we start from the following on-shell (special) supersymmetry transfor-

mation rules [21]:

the denition of the covariant eld strength in (2.5) implies a choice for the
matter term, which was not included in its denition in [21]. to realize the
algebra with the supersymmetry transformation rules (2.2)-(2.4), the self-
duality condition,

h = 0 ,

(2.7)

must be used. in section 3 is explained how this condition is found from the
action (3.1).

the action for the self-dual tensor can be constructed by making use of
one auxiliary scalar a. this scalar does not transform under supersymmetry:

qa = 0 .

(2.8)

its derivative is u = a. it always appears in the action in the following
way:

the contraction of the ((anti)self-dual) eld strength with v is dened as

h  hv ,

h  hv .

(2.10)

there are three local bosonic gauge symmetries that act on the tensor and
the eld a. the rst one is the usual reducible gauge transformation for a
antisymmetric tensor:

ib = 2[];

ia = 0 .

(2.11)

this gauge symmetry has a reducible component:

the two other gauge symmetries act in the following way on b and a:

 =  .

(2.12)

iib = 2h


u2

iiib = u[] .

iia =  ,

(2.13)

(2.14)

all the other elds are inert under each of these three symmetries. the h
in ii contains the covariant eld strength (2.5). also symmetry iii has a
zero mode:  = u. a last reducible gauge transformation is formed by a
combination of i and iii:  = u and  = 2.
the divergence of the auxiliary eld can be considered as the gauge eld of the
second symmetry, since u transforms into the derivative of the parameter:

iiu =  .

the commutators of these gauge symmetries are:

[ii(2), ii(1)] = iii(4

[ii(), iii()] = i ( 1

h
(u2)3/2 (12  21)) ,
2) + iii(2[]  u 
u2 ) .

(2.15)

(2.16)

(2.17)

their role in the gauge-xing of the bosonic symmetries can be found in [4].
making use of these gauge symmetries, it is possible to write down other
supersymmetry transformation rules for the spinors that realize the algebra
without using the self-duality condition (2.7). this comes already closer to an
o-shell realization of the algebra, since the self-duality condition (2.7) must

5

not be used any more. therefore, we will replace the self-dual component of
the eld strength in (2.3) by another self-dual tensor (as in [22]), such that
it gives the old transformation rule upon imposing the self-duality condition
(2.7):

we can rewrite the terms with v in h+

1

4 (cid:18)h  3u[ (cid:18)2

h 

]u2(cid:19)(cid:19) .

(2.18)

(2.19)

the last term can be seen as the product of u, the gauge eld of the second
symmetry as argued before (2.15), and (2.13), the ii-transformation of b.
we dene covariant derivatives of a eld as its partial derivative minus the
gauge transformation(s) where the parameter is replaced by the gauge eld.
in this sense, h+
 can be considered as the fully covariant eld strength of
b, where fully means also with respect to gauge symmetry ii. h+
 is
automatically self-dual in this way. the new supersymmetry transformation
rule, which gives rise to the old one by imposing (2.7), is then:

i =

1
12

h+
i +

1
4 6dijj  ijj .

(2.20)

by considering h+
 as the fully covariant eld strength of b, we under-
stand better why this term appears in the supersymmetry transformation
rules. before, it was unclear where this self-dual tensor came form. the
supersymmetry transformation rule depends also on the matter terms, pro-
portional to ijt ij
. this is necessary to realize the algebra (2.24)
(and later also to nd the invariance of the action). this was one of the
reasons to include also the matter term in (2.5).
the covariant derivative of i and ij and the covariant dalembertian of ij

formations. when using (2.2), (2.20) and (2.4), the transformation rules

some comments can be made about this algebra:

the d in the rst term of (2.24) is a covariant general coordinate trans-
formation [26]. this includes all the superconformal transformations, gauge
symmetry i and also gauge symmetry ii. the covariant general coordinate
transformation with derivative d contains terms which are a gauge trans-
formation i, ii or iii. there is no natural gauge eld for symmetry iii, so
d is only covariant with respect to symmetry i and ii.
the term in the algebra with gauge transformation i was already intro-
duced in [20] for the case of the (1, 0) self-dual tensor. this means that each
of the gauge symmetries plays a specic role in the algebra: symmetry i, ii
and iii in the covariant general coordinate transformations, while symmetry
i appears also with a eld-dependent gauge transformation.

with u as the gauge eld for symmetry ii, the algebra on a becomes

2(i
[q(1), q(2)] a = 1
2(i

= 0 ,

21i) da
21i)(a  u)

(2.27)

both for the rigid and the local supersymmetric case. so, a is a supersym-
metric singlet [27].

using the prescription of appendix b in [21], it is possible to re-derive
the (1, 0)-algebra. the term with the lorentz rotation and gauge symme-
try i give immediately the right term. the terms with special conformal
symmetry and special supersymmetry need more work. the relevant terms

7

of the constraints and transformation rules dier slightly for the dierent
a when going to (1, 0) need to be taken
cases. also the shifts in i
into account. also in simple chiral supergravity, symmetries i, ii and iii
appear in the commutator of two supersymmetries.

 and f

finally, we remark that the algebra is not realised o-shell. in the trans-
formation of h (3.8), the equation of motion of the spinor still appears.
therefore, in the commutator of two supersymmetries on i there also ap-
pears an equation of motion. also the commutator of symmetry ii with
supersymmetry contains terms with equations of motion.

3 the superconformal action

in [7] was already proven that the action of the rigid model has supercon-
formal invariance. here, we give the action for the self-dual tensor multiplet
with local (2, 0) superconformal symmetry. we also see that the action, as
expected, gives rise to the equations of motion of [21].

the following action is invariant under local superconformal transforma-

tions and under the 3 bosonic symmetries (2.11), (2.13) and (2.14):

conformal supergravity background. the rst gauge symmetry imposes that
b only appears in a eld strength in the action. the second and the third
gauge symmetries impose the form of the action as given in (3.1) for terms
that transform with respect to one of these symmetries. the second part of
the rst line contains only covariantization terms. it is imposed by the third
gauge symmetry and can also be found in the local super-poincare actions for
self-dual tensors [22]. it is absent for free chiral bosons. all the coecients of
the action are xed by imposing invariance under supersymmetry and special
supersymmetry.

the action (3.1) gives rise to the following eld equations for b, a, i

and ij:

(3.6)

the equations (3.5) and (3.6) are the equations of motion as derived in
[21]. also the self-duality condition (2.7) corresponds corresponds to the
self-duality equation derived there. the only dierence is the one but last
term in (3.6), but that is a term proportional to the self-duality condition.
rewriting (3.3) gives:

g =  (cid:16)vh (cid:17) = 0 .

(3.7)

analogous to the rigid case, the self-duality condition (2.7) can be found by a
gauge-choice of symmetry iii for the most general solution of this equation
of motion (if there are no global obstructions). so, this action describes a
self-dual two-form.

the description using this action is more satisfactory than the one of [23].
there, rst the action for an ordinary tensor is written down and the equation
of motion is derived. only then, the self-duality condition is imposed. here
the self-duality is automatically incorporated in the action and follows from
the equation of motion.

4 conclusions

in this article we have interpreted the second bosonic symmetry as a gauge
symmetry with gauge eld u. its role in the supersymmetry transforma-
tion rules and in the realization of the osp(8|4)-algebra has become more
clear. it appears on the right hand side in the covariant general coordinate
transformation in the commutator of two supersymmetries. one also nds
that the auxiliary scalar a is a supersymmetric singlet. gauge symmetry i
appears as a eld-dependent gauge transformation in the commutator of two
supersymmetries.

furthermore, we have given the action for a self-dual tensor multiplet
coupled to a chiral conformal gravity background with (2, 0) supersymmetry.
this action gives rise to the equations of motion found earlier in [21]. the
self-duality follows from the action by imposing a gauge xing of symmetry
iii.

the action, (3.1), is the most general one for the coupling of self-dual
tensor multiplets to (conformal) supergravity. using the prescription of [21],
the poincare action for n self-dual tensor multiplets can be derived from this
superconformal formulation. one starts with n + 5 tensor multiplets in the
vector representation of so(n, 5).
imposing the suitable constraints that
gauge-x the appropriate superconformal symmetries (dilatations, special
conformal symmetry and special supersymmetry) yields the coupling of n
self-dual tensor multiplets to (2, 0) poincare supergravity. the 5n scalars of
these n tensor multiplets parameterize the coset

so(n,5)

so(n)so(5) [19, 21].

using the procedure in [21] to move from (2, 0) to (1, 0), one discovers
the action for a self-dual tensor multiplet in a (1, 0) superconformal gravity
background. for this case, a similar procedure is possible to move further
towards a poincare description. starting from n + 1 tensor multiplets in
the vector representation of so(n, 1) and imposing the right constraints will
break the superconformal symmetry. this should give the actions of [22].

10

the scalars in the poincare theory are in so(n,1)
[19]. in this context, with
so(n)
(1, 0) supersymmetry, couplings of actions for self-dual tensor multiplets to
other matter multiplets are possible.

an interesting project would be to calculate the conformal anomaly for
the self-dual tensor, e.g. by following the approach in [28] and using the
ghost sector of the action for the self-dual tensor of [4]. this weak-coupling
calculation can be compared with the strong-coupling result in [29].
