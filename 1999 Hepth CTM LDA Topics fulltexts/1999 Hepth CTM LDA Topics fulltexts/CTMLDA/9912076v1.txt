abstract

we demonstrate how actions for interacting superconformal eld theories in
(p+1)-dimensions arise as a result of gauge xing worldvolume dieomor-
phisms and fermionic -symmetry in actions for super-p-branes propagating in
superbackgrounds of adsp+2  sdp2 geometry. the method of nonlinear re-
alizations and coset spaces is used for getting an explicit form of supervielbeins
and superconnections of the ads  s superbackgrounds, which are required
for the construction of the superconformal theories. subtleties of consistent
gauge xing worldvolume symmetries of the branes are discussed.

during the last two years there have been a great interest and an intensive
development of the maldacena conjecture [1] which suggests that supergravity
theories (or, more generally, superstring theories and mtheory) on spacetimes
with a geometry of antidesitter times a compact manifold (for instance, a
sphere s) are in a certain sense equivalent (or dual) to superconformal theories
living on a boundary of the ads space. more precise statement is that the
generating functional of correlation functions of observables of the conformal
eld theory on the boundary is equal to the partition function of supergravity
(or string) theory in the bulk [1]. in a classical approximation this reads

where sads() is the action for the elds  of the bulk theory, and 0 are
boundary values of , which are considered as sources for conformal elds
(operators) o of the conformal theory on m.
for more profound analysis and check of this correspondence it is desirable
to know the detailed structure of the bulk theory (for instance, iib superstring
in ads5s5) and the structure of the superconformal theory on the boundary.
this is especially essential for understanding eld interactions.
this information can be provided by corresponding eective actions in-
variant under superconformal transformations. a natural way of getting such
actions is to consider the dynamics of superbranes in ads  s backgrounds,
from which, in fact, the ads/cft conjecture originated.
in this connection an extensive work has been undertaken by several the-
oretical groups to derive superconformal eld theory actions from d = p + 1
worldvolume actions of superbranes in adsp+2  sdp2 backgrounds of d
dimensional supergravity [2][7].
the idea is rather simple and natural. the adsp+2  sdp2 superback-
ground has isometry symmetry described by a supergroup g. for instance,
in the case of an mtheory membrane, when p = 2 and d = 11, g is an
orthosimplectic supergroup osp(8|4); in the m5brane case p = 5, d = 11
and g = osp(2, 6|4); and in the case of the iib d3brane p = 3, d = 10 and
g = su(2, 2|4). (the numbers in the names of the supergroups correspond to
their bosonic subgroups). the maximal bosonic subgroup of g (which is the
bosonic isometry of adsp+2  sdp2) is so(2, p + 1)  so(d  p  1), and
the fermionic transformations of g are generated by 32 grassmann generators
q. now recall that so(2, p + 1) is also a group of conformal transforma-
tions acting on a (p+1)dimensional spacetime mp+1 associated with the
boundary of adsp+2. in the approach under consideration the role of mp+1 is
played by the d = p + 1 worldvolume of the corresponding superbrane. the
whole supergroup g will thus be associated with superconformal symmetry of
a worldvolume eld theory describing the dynamics of the physical modes of
the superbrane.

consider in detail how the superconformal theory is derived from the su-
perbrane action with the use of the example of an m2brane in ads4  s7.
all other more complicated cases (d3brane, m5brane etc.) can be treated
in a similar way.

let us start with the discussion of general properties of superbrane world-
volume actions. the action for a supermembrane propagating in a d = 11

the appearance of the spinor projector in the transformations reects the
fact that the presence of the supermembrane in the target superspace breaks
half the 32 supersymmetries of a d = 11 supergravity vacuum, the unbroken
supersymmetries being associated with those grassmann coordinates  which
can be eliminated by symmetry transformations, while remaining 16  are
worldvolume goldstone fermions of the spontaneously broken supersymmetries
and describe physical fermionic modes of supermembrane uctuations.

an important requirement for the transformations (5) to be a symmetry
of the membrane action (2) is that the targetspace supervielbeins ea(z),

other constraints are either conventional or can be obtained from (7) and (8)

the d = 11 supergravity constraints are amount to supergravity equations
of motion. therefore, a supergravity background compatible with membrane
symmetry must be a solution of supergravity eld equations. when the
gravitino eld is zero the supergravity equations are the einstein equations for
the d = 11 curvature and maxwelllike equations for f (4)

the ads4  s7 is one of the solutions of (9) found almost twenty years ago
by freund and rubin [9] with the purpose to compactify d = 11 supergravity
ala kaluza and klein. for such a solution the gravitino eld 
m(x) is zero.

it has been known that this solution is invariant under the maximum
number of supersymmetry transformations whose 32 parameters satisfy an
ads4  s7 killing spinor condition.

as a metric on ads4  s7 it is convenient to take the following one

r(cid:19)4
ds2 = (cid:18) r

dxiijdxj +(cid:18)r
r (cid:19)

2

dr2 + r2d2 ,

(10)

where xi, r (i = 0, 1, 2) are coordinates of the ads4 and d2 stands for a metric
of the sphere s7 of a radius r parametrized by coordinates ya (a = 1, ..., 7).
the coordinates xi of ads4 will be identied with the worldvolume coordinates
i upon imposing a static gauge.

when r   the second term in (10) tends to zero and eectively the ads
part of the metric becomes threedimensional. the at d = 3 metric dxiijdxj
is associated with the ads4 boundary m3 which is a minkowski space.

4

for this choice of the ads4s7 metric the gauge eld a(3)(x) = a(3)(z)|=0
and its eld strength f (4), which satisfy the d = 11 supergravity equations,
have the following components which are nonzero only in the ads4 part of
spacetime

a(3) = dx2dx1dx0(

r

)6, f (4) = 6drdx2dx1dx0(

(11)

when the supermembrane propagates in the ads4  s7 supergravity back-
ground its action (2) is invariant under the supergroup osp(8|4) of the isome-
tries of this background, to which the targetspace superdieomorphisms (3)
are reduced. a superconformal form of the osp(8|4) superalgebra will be pre-
sented a bit later.
at this stage osp(8|4) is not yet the superconformal group which acts
on the worldvolume m3 of the membrane but it is rather an internal sym-
metry of the elds living on m3. for the osp(8|4) supergroup to become
a worldvolume superconformal symmetry one should (in an appropriate way)
gauge x the local worldvolume dieomorphisms (4) and the symmetry (5)
of the membrane action. this gauge xing eliminates the puregauge degrees
of freedom so that only elds which correspond to the physical modes of the
superbrane remain in the theory.

an appropriate condition for xing the worldvolume dieomorphisms is a
static gauge when worldvolume coordinates are identied with three coordi-
nates of ads4

i = xi

(12)
(which at r   parametrize the ads4 boundary). thus the membrane
worldvolume is associated with the ads4 boundary. in the static gauge eight
physical bosonic worldvolume elds are the ads radial coordinate r() and the
s7 coordinates ya().

(i = 0, 1, 2)

a possible gauge xing of symmetry (5) compatible with the static gauge

(12) is putting to zero the following 16 components of 

then other 16 coordinates

  [(1 + 012)] = 0.

  [(1  012)]

(13)

(14)

remain as the fermionic physical elds on m3. note that in the gauge (12)
1 + 012 coincides with the symmetry projector 1 +  when the membrane is

5

in a static (vacuum) state, i.e. when the bosonic elds (r, yi) are worldvolume
constants and  are zero. this makes the symmetry gauge (13) admissible.
a combination of the worldvolume bosonic (4) and fermionic (5) trans-
formations accompanied by the target superspace isometry transformations
of osp(8|4) which preserves the gauge xing conditions (12) and (13) now
becomes a nonlinearly realized superconformal symmetry on the superme-
mbrane worldvolume. this is because we have identied the worldvolume
coordinates with target space ads coordinates, and the parameters of the
worldvolume symmetries are now expressed in terms of the constant parame-
ters of target superspace symmetry osp(8|4). for instance, the static gauge
(12) is preserved if the parameters of the worldvolume transformations w and
-transformations  are related to the parameters of osp(8|4) transforma-
tions osp as follows

0 = xi  i = xi  i = xi  i + ospxi + wxi + xi  wi 

wxi  wi + xi = ospxi.

(15)

to nd an explicit form of the superconformal variations of the physical
elds r(), ya() and () and to derive from the original superbrane action
the superconformal action describing the dynamics of these elds one should
know an explicit form of the supervielbeins ea(z), e(z) and of the three
form supereld a(3)(z) which enter the supermembrane action. this is a key
point in the construction of the superconformal action.

at the moment we know only the leading components of these objects at
 = 0. these are the bosonic ads  s metric (10) and the bosonic value of
the a(3)(x, r) eld (11).
a direct way of getting ea(z), e(z) and a(3)(z) is to solve the supergrav-
ity constraints (7) and (8) taking the values (10) and (11) of the superforms at
 = 0 as initial conditions. this has been done by claus [5]. however, this ex-
plicit form is rather complicated since ea(x, ) and e(x, ) are polynomials
of up to the 32-nd power in . even if half of  are eliminated by gauge xing
symmetry, this will, in general, result in polynomials of the 16-th power. so,
if written in terms of these polynomials the supermembrane action looks very
cumbersome and untreatable. hence it is desirable to nd simpler form of the
ads superforms.

perspace as a so called coset superspace.

an elegant way of looking for this form is to consider the ads4  s7 su-
the method of coset spaces has been applied to the description of ads  s
superspaces in a number of papers [2, 3, 4, 6, 7] and is based on a classical

6

work of cartan on group manifolds, symmetric and homogeneous spaces. it
is worth mentioning that the rst physical model with global supersymmetry
[10] and the rst supergravity [11] was constructed by using this method.

let us briey sketch basic ideas of this method by the use of the example
of the ads superspace. as we have already discussed the ads4  s7 super-
space has the isometry symmetry described by the supergroup osp(8|4). this
means that a given point z m = (x m, ) of this superspace can be con-
nected with another point by an osp(8|4) transformation. a subgroup of
g = osp(8|4) which leaves a given point z m intact is called the stability (or
isotropy) subgroup of g. in our case the stability group is a bosonic group
h = so(1, 3) so(7) which acts on a superspace tangent to ads4  s7. the
connection forms which dene the parallel transport in the ads superspace
take their values in the algebra of h.

the space with these properties is called the coset space and is denoted as

k = g/h.

it is the space of the classes of equivalence of the points of g which are related
by the htransformations.

in our case

k =

osp(8|4)

.

so(1, 3)  so(7)

note that the bosonic subspaces ads4 and s7 of this superspace are coset
spaces themselves, actually, they are symmetric spaces

ads4 =

so(2, 3)
so(1, 3)

,

s7 =

so(8)
so(7)

.

note also that the dierence between the dimensions of the group g and h is
equal to the (bosonic plus fermionic) dimension of the coset space

dim k = dim g  dim h.

thus the generators of g, called coset generators k, which are not contained
in the stability subgroup of h, are in one to one correspondence with the coset
space coordinates z m and are associated with the boosts of the points of the
coset superspace.

now remember that an element of the group g can be represented as an
exponent of the generators gi of the group times parameters of the group
transformations i, considered as coordinates of the group manifold g

g() = exp (igi).

(16)

7

by analogy, we can identify a point z m = (x m, ) of the ads superspace
with a coset element k(z) realized as an exponent

k(z) = exp (x apa +  q),

(17)

where pa = (pi, pr; pa) (i = 0, 1, 2, a = 1, ..., 7) are bosonic boosts acting,
respectively, on ads4 and s7, and q are supertranslations (supercharges).

to get the variation properties of the ads superspace coordinates x m, 

under osp(8|4) one should act on k(z) by a supergroup element g()

k (z (, z)) = g()k(z).

if we now use k(z) to construct a so called cartan oneform l = k 1(z)dk(z),

it is claimed that this form takes values in the algebra of g, and its compo-
nents are supervielbeins and superconnections describing the geometry of the
ads superspace

l = k 1(z)dk(z) = eapa + e q + abmab.

(18)

the oneforms ea, e corresponding to the boost generators pa, q are su-
pervielbeins (which we can use to construct the supermembrane action), while
the oneforms ab are connections in the ads superspace taking their values
in the stability subalgebra h = so(1, 3)  so(7) generated by mab. note that
the indices a and  correspond now to the vector and a spinor representation
of the stability group, respectively.

to convince oneself that ea, e and ab have indeed the properties of
vielbeins and connections, consider their transformation properties under the
action of the stability group h, which acts on k(z) from the right:

k (z) = k(z)h(z),

l = k 1dk  = h 1(k 1dk)h + h 1dh.

(19)

comparing (18) with (19) we see that ea, e transform homogeneously under
htransformations, while ab acquires an inhomogeneous contribution from
h 1dh which takes values in the algebra of the generators mab. thus, ea, e
and ab indeed have the correct transformation properties of supervielbeins
and superconnections under the tangent superspace stability group.

now, taking an exponential parametrization (17) of the coset element k(z)
(which is in fact not unique and corresponds to a choice of a local supercoordi-
nate system), substituting it into the expression for the cartan form (18) and
making use of the exact form of the superalgebra of the osp(8|4) generators

8

one can derive an explicit form of the supervielbeins and superconnections. in
general they will be again polynomials of the 32-nd power in , as has been
obtained by metsaev and tseytlin [2]. and further work is required to check
whether this polynomial dependence can be reduced down to lower powers in
 due to some matrix identities, which is a priori not obvious.

an alternative way is to nd a suitable exponential parametrization of
the coset element k(z) which would directly produce the supervielbeins and
superconnections as short polynomials in . such a parametrization has been
found in [6]. the idea has been to arrange the generators of osp(8|4) in such a
way that their (anti) commutators take the explicit form of the superconformal
algebra acting on a d = 3 subspace m3 of ads4. so let us take the following
generators as the coset superspace generators which appear in the exponent of
k(z)

i (i = 0, 1, 2)  the boost (momenta) generators on m3;
pr = d  the dilatation generator;
pa (a = 1, ..., 7)  boosts on the s7 sphere;
q = (1 + 012) q  ordinary supersymmetry transformations;
s = (1  012) q  special superconformal transformations.
to close the osp(8|4) superalgebra we must add to these generators the
generators which correspond to the stability group so(1, 3)  so(7). these
consist of so(7) rotations mab, so(1, 2) rotations mij plus boost generators
mir = i  ki which all together form the generators mab of the so(1, 3)
rotations, and the generators ki of special conformal transformations of m3.
the osp(8|4) superalgebra written in terms of these generators has a rela-
tively simple form

[i, j] = 0, [i, q] = 0, {q, q}  ii, [d, i] = i, {d, q} =

[ki, kj] = 0,

[ki, s] = 0,

(22)
where ta stand for the generators d, mij, pa and mab. to close the osp(8|4)
superalgebra one should add to (20)(22) commutation relations of i and ki
with ta. but it is not necessary to know these commutators explicitly for the
derivation of the cartan superform.

[ta, s] = g



a s,

9

we see that the commutation relations of i and q, and ki and s form

threedimensional super poincare subalgebras of osp(8|4).

now, as the exponent parametrization of the coset k(z) let us take

k = exiie(log r

r )deya



pa eqes,

(23)

where  = (1 + 012) and  = (1  012) are projected ads grassmann
coordinates already considered above in connection with symmetry gauge
xing (13).

using this parametrization and the form (20)(22) of the osp(8|4) commu-
tation relations we can compute the components of the cartan form k 1dk
which appear to be polynomials of only 6-th power in  and . we can simplify
the form of the supervielbeins even more if we gauge x the symmetry of
the supermembrane in a suitable way. as we have already discussed (eq. (13))
a possible gauge choice is to put to zero the supercoordinates  (eq. (13)).
after such a gauge xing the exponent drops out of k(z) in (23) and the
resulting cartan form components become polynomials of the 4-th power in .
for instance, the vector supervielbeins which form the induced worldvol-
ume metric have the following structure (for simplicity we skip numerical co-
ecients)

dxi + idi,

(24)

er =

r(cid:19)2

dxi(iha) are supervielbeins and supercon-
nections associated with the generators d, pa and mab and ea(x, r, y) are their
bosonic values at  = 0.

we see that supervielbeins and superconnections have a relatively simple
form, though if we substitute them into the supermembrane action we will get
an action for a superconformal eld theory which still has a rather complicated
structure of eld interactions, which hinders the analysis of this theory.

much simpler form (up to the second power in ) of the supervielbeins and
superconnections might be obtained if in the exponent representation (23),
instead of putting to zero  we might put to zero . such a symmetry gauge

10

choice would be compatible with an (anti)static gauge of the worldvolume
dieomorphisms, when, for example, the worldvolume time is identied with
minus ads time coordinate

0 = x0,

1 = x1,

2 = x2.

then we would have

ei = (

r
r

)2(dxi + idi), er = er(x, r, y), e =

d,

(25)

(26)

which look very much like at superspace covariant superforms.

this simple symmetry gauge was proposed in [4] and [12], and is called
a supersolvable algebra gauge, or a killing spinor gauge. it is called supersolv-
able since when  = 0 the remaining generators in the parametrization of the
coset element k(z) in (23) form a subsuperalgebra of osp(8|4), which is an
extension of a d = 3 superpoincare algebra by the dilatation generator d.
and it is called a killing spinor gauge since it corresponds to an appropriate

choice of the solution of the ads killing spinor equation.

in this gauge the supermembrane action would take much simpler form, but
here appears a problem that this gauge is not always admissible. for instance,
it is not compatible with a natural static vacuum solution of the superbrane
equations of motion when

i = xi,

r = const,

ya

= const,  = 0,

(27)

i.e. when the brane completely lives in a threedimensional slice of the ads4
spacetime. for such a solution  = 0 is an admissible gauge. note that
the static vacuum solution (27) is a bps saturated state since it is invariant
under the 16 standard supersymmetries q and (spontaneously) breaks special
superconformal symmetry s, which is nonlinearly realized on the excitations
over this vacuum solution.

the  = 0 gauge would be compatible with an (anti) static conguration

with the reverse orientation of time (or a space) coordinate, i.e.

0 = x0,

1 = x1,

2 = x2,

r = const,

ya

= const,  = 0,

(28)

but this is not a solution of the superbrane equations, unless r is zero. and
when r = 0 such a brane conguration shrinks to a point at the ads horizon.
physically this conguration describes an antibrane which is attracted by a
bunch of branes whose metric near horizon is close to that of ads  s.

11

there may exist, however, antistatic brane congurations, compatible
with the killing gauge, which extend along the radial coordinate of ads
and/or somehow nontrivially wind around compact directions of the sphere.
in general, such brane congurations will break all supersymmetries of the
superbackground. however, an action which describes uctuations over these
congurations will have a simple fermionic structure due to the simple form of
the supervielbeins (26), and it would be of interest to study the properties of
such theories.

the above examples teach us that the gauge choice is a subtle point and
depends on which classical solution of eld equations one deals with. recently
this problem has been also discussed in the case of a d0brane in ads2  s2
[13].
an example of the use of the killing spinor gauge ( = 0) is a iib su-
perstring propagating in the ads5  s5 superbackground. the ads5  s5
superbackground can be viewed as a large n limit of coincident d3branes.
the killing gauge is compatible with superstring symmetry since the -
symmetry projector now diers from the one used to impose the killing gauge,
the latter being related to the d3brane symmetry projector.

this theory has been considered by pesando, kallosh and rahmfeld, and

kallosh and tseytlin [2].

using the ads5  s5 supervielbeins in the killing gauge, which have the
form analogous to that written in (26), one can obtain the following supercon-
formal action for the iib superstring

s = 

1

2 z d2 (cid:20)g gij y2(ixp  2ipi)(jxp  2ipj) +

1

y2 iytjyt!

+ 4iijiyt tj (cid:21) ,

(29)

where now i (i = 0, 1) parametrize the superstring worldvolume, gij() is an
intrinsic (auxiliary) worldvolume metric, xp (p = 0, 1, 2, 3) denote coordinates
parallel to the d3branes; yt = (r, ya), which include the ads radial coor-
dinate and the s5 coordinates, stand for the coordinates orthogonal to the
d3branes, and y2 = ytyt.

this action diers from a iib string action in a at d = 10 superback-
ground, with symmetry being gauge xed in the same way as in (29), by
the factors y2 and 1
y2 .

now, having the action for a iib superstring in ads5  s5 one can study
classical and quantum properties of this theory. first steps in this direction
were undertaken by kallosh and tseytlin. it has been realized that it is not

12

obvious that the superstring equations yielded by such an action admit su-
persymmetric classical solutions. it would be of interest to analyze a duality
relation of this theory with a d = 4 yangmills theory on the boundary
of ads. for this one should also know a corresponding d3brane action in
ads5  s5 which would produce the yangmills theory. this action is still
under construction due to problems discussed above.
in conclusion what we have learned about the superbranes in the ads
backgrounds is that dierent gauge choices for xing symmetry of the orig-
inal brane action may result in dierent worldvolume actions (and eld theo-
ries). this is because we deal with topologically nontrivial backgrounds such
as ads  s, and the most gauge xing conditions are only locally admissible,
and/or implicitly reect how the brane is embedded into the background. the
problem of nding globally dened conditions for gauge xing brane actions
in ads  s has been considered in [14]. the light-cone gauge formalism for
theories in ads spaces has been developed in [15].
an unexpected observation which we have made is that actions which admit
classical vacuum congurations preserving eective worldvolume supersymme-
try have more complicated structure of the fermionic sector than actions for
which the existence of supersymmetric brane congurations is problematic.
