abstract

the consequences of coupling of the torsion (highest curvature) term to the la-
grangian of a massive spinless particle in four-dimensional space time are studied.
it is shown that the modied system remains spinless and possesses extended gauge
invariance. though the torsion term does not generate spin, it provides the system
with a nontrivial mass spectrum, described by one-dimensional conformal mechan-
ics. under an appropriate choice of characteristic constants the system has solutions
with a discrete mass spectrum.

1 introduction

now it is the part of physical folklore that relativistic systems can be provided with
a nontrivial spin, by including, in the lagrangians, the terms depending on principal
curvatures. though many interesting observations in this subject are known, especially
related to 3d and 4d particle systems, depending on rst and second principal curvatures
(see [1] and refs therein), such systems are not still studied completely even in these lowest
dimensions.

in this note we consider a four-dimensional massive particle model with a lagrangian

proposed by m.plyushchay [2]

s = z (c0 + ck3)ds,

ds = |dx|  sd 6= 0

(1.1)

where  is an arbitrary evolution parameter and k3 is a torsion (highest curvature) of a
worldline in 4d space.

we will show that this system possesses interesting properties which make it drastically
dierent from other four- and three- dimensional massive particle systems depending on
principal curvatures:

 it has a zero spin;
 it possesses an extended gauge invariance: the rst and second curvatures of its

classical trajectories are dened via the expression

k 2

while the evolution of the parameter q and mass spectrum are described by the
conformal mechanics with the energy e,

if  > 0

,

where  = c0/c,  < q < 0, and m denotes the mass of the system. when
 < 0, the upper sign corresponds to the time-like trajectories, while other solutions
corresponds to the space-like ones.

 when  < 1/2, the solutions with space-like trajectories possess a discrete spec-
trum with massive and tachionic sectors, while the solutions with time-like tra-
jectories possess continuous spectrum containing massive, massless, and tachionic
solutions.

the paper is arranged as follows:

in section 2 we construct the hamiltonian system corresponding to the model under
consideration (1.1). we show that the system possesses an extended gauge invariance
and a zero spin. the geometry of its classical trajectories and quantum spectrum (in
the euclidean space) are dened by the one-dimensional conformal mechanics (with a
repulsive potential).

in section 3 we reformulate the hamiltonian system constructed in section 2 in the

minkowski space and consider the properties of its mass spectrum.

2 hamiltonian formulation

in this section we give the hamiltonian formulation of the model (1.1).

recall that the principal curvatures ka of a (non-null) curve in four-dimensional space

can be dened via the frenet equations for the moving frame ea :

x = se1,

k c

a cb = 


ea = k b

a, b, c = 1, 2, 3, 4;

,

ka1 = ska1,

k3
0




(2.1)

(2.2)

where x are coordinates of four-dimensional space, and ea are elements of the moving
frame.
while k1, k2 are positive quantities, the sign of the highest curvature k3 (torsion) is not
uniquely dened by the frenet equations [3]. without loss of generality we assume below
that k3 > 0.

in the euclidean space ab = ab, so the frenet equations read

ea = kaea+1  ka1ea1,

e0 = e5  0.

(2.3)

one can transform the frenet equations in the euclidean space into those in the

minkowski space, performing the following transition

(ea, ka, ka1, s)  (iea, ika, ika1, (i)1as)

(2.4)

for some index a.
indeed, this transformation preserves the form of the matrix in (2.2), while the element
ea becomes time-like: e2
a = 1. so, we can give our basic derivations for the euclidean
case, reformulating them for the minkowski space for a nal analysis.

it follows from (2.3) that

s =  x2,

ka = eaea+1 = q e2

a  k2

a1.

(2.5)

thus, the lagrangian appearing in the action (1.1) in the euclidean space can be replaced
by the following one

l = c0s + cq e2

3  k2

2 + p( x  se1) +xi

pi1( ei1  ki1ei + ki2ei2) xi,j

dij(eiej  ij),
(2.6)

where x, p, ei, pi1, s, ki, dij are independent variables, i, j = 1, 2, 3.

now we can perform the legendre transformation for this lagrangian (referring for

details to [4]).
the variables pi1 represent the momenta conjugated to ei1, whereas the momenta
conjugated to (s, ki1, dij) lead to the trivial constraints

ps  0,

pi1  0,

pij  0.

3

(2.7)

setting k3 6= 0 we nd that the momentum conjugated to e3 is of the form

3  k2
taking into account (2.5), we get the constraints
p3e3  0, p3e1  0, p2

p3 = c(cid:16) e2

2(cid:17)1/2

e3.

3  (p3e2)2  c2  0.

(2.8)

(2.9)

then the construction of primary hamiltonian system becomes straightforward.

to simplify the resulting system, one can stabilize trivial primary constraints (2.7) and
exclude them from our considerations, which makes the variables s, ki1, dij lagrangian
multipliers. without loss of generality one can also impose the gauge conditions (see for
a details [4])

p3e2  0, p2e2  0, p2e1  0.
after these manipulations we get the hamiltonian system

 = dp  dx +pi dpi  dei,

h = s(pe1  c0) +pi ki1i1.i + k3

2c (p2

3  c2) +pi,j dij(eiej  ij),

with primary constraints

piej  0,
i  j
eiej  ij  0,
pe1  c0  0,

i1.i  pi1ei  piei1  0, p2

3  c2  0,

(2.10)

(2.11)
(2.12)
(2.13)
(2.14)

where variables s, ki, dij play the role of lagrangian multipliers.

let us stabilize the primary constraints (2.11)-(2.14).

stabilization of (2.11) gives the following xation of the lagrangian multipliers dij:

so that the equations of motion read

2di.j = k3ci.3j.3  sc01.i1.j,

x = e1,

e1 = k1e2,

e2 = k1e1 + k2e3,
e3 = k2e2 + k3p3/c
p3 = k3ce3  k2p2,
p2 = k1p1 + k2p3,

p1 = sp + k1p2 + sc0e1,

p = 0.

(2.15)

(2.16)

stabilizing the remaining primary constraints, we get the following rst-stage secondary
constraints

pe2  0, p1e3  0, p3p2  0.

(2.17)

4

from the ortogonality of (ei, p3/c) to p2, which follows from (2.14),(2.11),(2.17) we con-
clude that

stabilizing the rst and second constraints from (2.17) and the constraint (2.18), we get

p2  0.

(2.18)

where

then we get

where

k2 = qk1,

k3 = sc0/cq2,

p1 = qp3,

1/q 

pe3

6= 0.

p = c0e1 + c0e3/q + pp3,

p  pp3/c2.

(2.19)
(2.20)

(2.21)

(2.22)

(2.23)

consistency of the equations of motion (2.16) with the frenet equations implies that

ea = {ei, e4  p3/c} :

eaeb = ab.

(2.24)

therefore, the initial hamiltonian system can be formulated purely in terms of the moving
frame ea, coordinates x, and momentum p, while the relations (2.24), (2.22) play the role
of constraints.

taking into account the constraint (2.22)), we get the expressions for the rotation

generators:

and the casimirs

j = p  x +xi

pi  ei = p  (x  qp3/c0)

p2 = (cp)2 + c2

0(1 + 1/q2), w2  (p  j)2 = 0.

(2.25)

(2.26)

thus, the system possesses a zero spin despite the dependence of the initial lagrangian
on higher derivatives.

the expression for rotation generators (2.25) hints us to introduce the eective

coordinate

x  x  qp3/c0 :

x = sp/c0, p = const

(2.27)

whose evolution equations look similar to the convenient relation between velocity and
momentum of a massive particle (note, that in spite of these relations the mass of the
system is not equal to c0).

the reduction of the initial hamiltonian system (2.10) by the constraints (2.24), (2.22),

(2.20) leads to the following unconstrained system

red = dp  dx +

so, the system under consideration possesses extended gauge invariance, which is expressed
in the fact that all the trajectories with the same ratio k1/k2 are gauge equivalent.

reducing the system (2.28) by p, to exclude the trivial part of dynamics (2.27), we
get that the evolution of the parameter q is described by the textbook mechanical system

dp  dq, h0 = p2/2 +

as well as at the quantum one. the energy spectrum is continuous and has the lowest
bound e = 0 which is not normalizable. thus, adding of the torsion term increases the
absolute value of momenta of the system with respect to the torsionless system, p2  c2
0.
the system (2.30) is known in literature as a conformal mechanics, due to the symmetry
of its action under conformal transformations generated by h0, d = pq, k = q2/2. 1

3 transition to minkowski space

in the previous section we constructed the constrained hamiltonian system corresponding
to the action (1.1) in the euclidean space. we found that the evolution and the geometry
of this system are described in terms of the non-relativistic conformal mechanics with
repulsive potential. the purpose of this section is to consider the relativistic aspects
of this system, i.e. to investigate the model (1.1) in the minkowski space. as we have
mentioned in the beginning of section 2, we can use the results concerning the euclidean
case, since the frenet formulae in the euclidean space can be transformed into the ones in
minkowski space with the use of transition (2.4), where a denotes an element of moving
frame which becomes time-like, i.e. e2
a = 1. correspondingly, for the transition to time-
like trajectories we have to choose a = 1, while for the transition to space-like trajectories
we have to choose a 6= 1. we do not consider here systems with light-like trajectories.

for convenience we will use the notation

p2  m 2,  =

c0
c

,

(3.1)

so that m 2 >, =, < 0 corresponds to the massive, massless, and tachionic sectors of the
system, respectively.

1in [5] the conformal symmetry of this system has been used for solving the problem of the ground
state. recently this mechanism has been found to be adequate to the problem of motion of charged a
particle in the eld of a charged black hole [6].

6

to reformulate the system under consideration in the minkowski space we have to
supply the transition (2.4) with appropriate transformations of characteristic constants
c0, c and momenta pi which preserve the form of the initial action (1.1) and the initial
hamiltonian system, namely,

a = 1 :
a = 2 :
a = 3 :
a = 4 :

(e1, p1, k1, s, c0)  (ie1,ip1, ik1,is, ic0);
(e2, p2, k2, k1)  (ie2,ip2, ik2, ik1),
(e3, p3, k3, k2, c)  (ie3,ip3, ik3, ik2,ic),

(c, k3)



(ic, ik3).

(3.2)

indeed, it is easy to see that it is only the ortonormality condition eaeb = (1)aaab
that is changes in (2.10) under this transformation. consequently, the reduced system
(2.30) with appropriately changed parameters describes the eective hamiltonian system
corresponding to the action (1.1) in the minkowski space.

the transition (3.2) induces the following transformation of the parameters and coor-

dinates of the reduced system (2.30)

(p, q, , c0, s) 

thus, the reduced system reads

dp  dq,

if a = 1, 2
if a = 3, 4.

(3.5)

due to positivity of curvatures ki, we conclude that

 a = 1, 3,
 a = 2, 4,

q < 0,

0 < q,

if

if

 < 0,

 > 0.

thus, in both cases the system possesses the solutions described by conformal mechanics
with a repulsive (a = 1, 2) and an attractive (a = 3, 4) potentials. the classical solutions
of these systems are of the form

q2 = ( eas2 + (1)[a]2/ea,

2s,

if e 6= 0,

if e = 0, a = 3, 4

7

when the potential is attractive (a = 3, 4), the parameter s is dened on the domain

s  ( ]  |/e|,

]|/e|, [,

|/e|[,

if e < 0,
if e > 0.

while the quantum spectrum of the mechanics with a repulsive potential is continuous,
the spectrum of conformal mechanics with an attractive potential can be both continu-
ous and discrete. the discrete spectrum corresponds to the strongly attractive potential
(|| > 1/2) and has an innite number of energy levels [7].
we rst consider the systems with repulsive potential

dp  dq, h0 =

2q2 ,

2 = ( (1  m 2/c2
2e
0),
(1 + m 2/c2
0),

if  < 0, a = 0
if  > 0, a = 1

(3.6)

notice that while in the rst case trajectories are time-like, those are space-like in the
second case.
since the energy e is positive both in classical and quantum cases, we get the restrictions
on the admissible value of the mass

for  < 0 and time-like trajectories (a = 1),

 m 2 < c2
0,
 m 2 < c2
0,

for  > 0, a = 2.

thus, in the rst case there are massive, massless, and tachionic states, while in the sec-
ond case the system is tachionic.

now we consider the systems with an attractive potential. in this case all trajectories

are space-like and are dened by the mechanics

dp  dq, h0 =

2 = ( (1 + m 2/c2
2e

0)
(1 + m 2/c2
0)

if  < 0, a = 3
if  > 0, a = 4

(3.7)

the spectrum of conformal mechanics with an attractive potential is continuous for e > 0
and for e  0, 2 < 1/4 (see [8]).
if the potential is strongly attractive 2 > 1/4, and e < 0, the system has a dicrete
spectrum with an innite number of bound states given by the expression [7]

en = h2b2 exp 2n
q2  1/4

, n = 0,1,2, . . . ,

where b is an undened phase factor.
so,

m 2

n/c2

 !2
0 = 1 + (1)sgn bh

therefore, for  > 0 the discrete branch corresponds to pure tachionic states, while for
if we choose b = /2h,
 < 0 it contains massive, massless, and tachionic sectors.

exp 2n
q2  1/4

,

|| > 1/2.

(3.8)

then we get, that the massive sector corresponds to the positive n, while the negative n
corresponds to the tachionic one.
