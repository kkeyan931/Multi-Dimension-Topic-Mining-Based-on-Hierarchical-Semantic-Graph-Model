abstract

in a recent paper klebanov and witten proposed [4] to fomulate the ads/cft correspondence
principle by taking an irregular boundary condition for a scalar eld. in this paper we generalize
this idea to the case of spinor eld with interaction. the action functional following from the
choice of irregular boundary conditions and which must be used in the ads/cft correspondence
is related to the usual action by a legendre transform. for the new theory we found the modied
greens function that must be used for internal lines in calculating higher order graphs.
it is
proved that the considerations are valid to all orders in perturbation theory.

1 introduction

the resent fascinating conjecture by maldacena [1] about the correspondence between supergravity
on d+1 anti-de sitter (ads) space and conformal field theory (cft) living on its asymptotic
d-dimensional boundary becomes a powerful tool in studying the string theory. the underlying
principle behind this ads/cft correspondence was elaborated in explicit form by gubser, klebanov
and polyakov [2] and witten [3]. according to [2] and [3], the action for the supergravity theory on
ads considered as a functional of the asymptotic values of the elds on the boundary is interpreted
as a generating functional for the correlation functions in the conformal eld theory living on the
boundary. the explicit form of this interpretation is:

z

dexp{s []} = hexp zads

ddxo0i

(1)

where 0 is the boundary data for ads theory which couples to a certain conformal operator o on
the boundary. this interpretation has already a number of proofs for various cases of elds form the
elds content of supergravity theory on ads space [3, 6, 7, 10, 8, 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17]2 . in all of
the above particular examples the eld solutions can be splitted into two parts (see for example [23])
with dierent behavior near the boundary:

(x)

x00

 x+

0 ++

x00

 x

(2)

where + are the uctuating modes in the bulk and  serves as a source for the correlation
functions in the cft living on the boundary (+ > ).since the eld equations possess two solutions
with dierent behavior, one must choose one of them and if the boundary conditions are imposed on

the elds  that are coupled on the boundary to a conformal operator with larger dimension  such
a boundary conditions we will reer as regular boundary conditions. recently klebanov and witten
[4] observed that using this scheme of calculations the unitary bound ( d
2  1  ) in the case of scalar
eld cannot be achieved and they proposed an eective method to include operators to do just that.
the proposed method, generalized later in [5] to the interacting case, using the choice of boundary
conditions for the eld solutions which would be coupled to operators on the boundary with smaller
dimension.
in [4, 5] was shown that the respective boundary elds are cannonicaly conjugated to
each other and theyr actions are connected by a legendre transform. the fact that the corresponding
boundary elds are conjugated was also suggested in [25] by using the technique of intertwinning
operators. the action depending on the irregular boundary values serves as a generating functional of
the correlation functions. in [4, 5] it was found also the modied greens function for this new theory
that must be used in the calculations of the correlation functions. the explicit form of the two point
correlation function in the case of scalar eld was found in [4, 5].

the aim of this article is to generalize the method of taking irregular boundary conditions proposed
for a scalar eld in [4, 5] to the case of spinor eld. as a byproduct of our considerations is derivation
of the modied greens function for the spinor eld that must be used to calculate second and higher
order graphs.

the structure of the article is as follows. in the rest of this section we will review the boundary term
for a spinor elds along the lines of [19] and will comment briey the possible boundary conditions.
the second section is devoted to the results from ads/cft correspondence principle connected to
regular boundary conditions. in section 3 we wll consider a theory corresponding to irregular boundary
conditions and the two point correlation function will be computed. the correctness of [4, 5] proposal
to all orders in perturbation theory will be discussed.

our starting point is the action for interacting spinor eld given by:

sd = zads

dd+1xg (x)(cid:0) /d  m(cid:1) (x) + sint

where g i determinat of the ads metric. we choose to work in coordinates xa = (x0, xi) = (x0, ~x); i =
1, . . . d dening d + 1-dimensional euclidean anti-de sitter space as lobachevski upper half plane
x0 > 0 with a metric of the form:

(3)

(4)

ds2 =

1
x2

0 (cid:0)dx0 + d~x2(cid:1)

with this choice the vielbein and the corresponding non-zero components of the spin connection are
given by the expressions:

e
a =

a

x0 ; 0j

i = j0

i =

j
i
x0 ;

a = 0, . . . d

(5)

the boundary of the ads space consists in a hypersurface x0 = 0 and a single point x0 = .
the gamma matrices  are connected to the at ones by  = e
aa where a satisfy the usual
commutation relations {a, b} = 2ab.

in this frame the covariant derivative and the dirac operator reads o:

d =  +

1
2x0 0 ; d = /d = x000 + x0~.~ 

d
2

0

where ~ = (i); ~ = (i); i = 1 . . . d.

the equations of motion following from the action (3) are given by:

(cid:0) /d  m(cid:1) (x) = 

sint
 (x)

= f (x)

2

(6)

(7)

and the equation for the bulk-bulk greens function for the above equation is:

(x)(cid:0) /d  m(cid:1) = 

sint
(x)

=  f (x)

with regulariry and boundary conditions:

(cid:0) /d  m(cid:1) s(x; y) = s(x; y)(cid:0) /d  m(cid:1) =

the explicit solution of (9) will be presented later. the solutions of equations (7,8) split into free eld
solutions and interacting parts:

spinors (h)

and irregular boundary values respectively. we will treat (h)
analogously. the case of spinor eld
possessing regular boundary conditions are well studied in the context of ads/cft correspondence
see for instance [10, 8]) and we will review their properties in the next section.

the bulk-boundary propagator can be easily obtained in the position space by inverse fourier trans-

let us discuss the bulk-bulk greens function considered in detais for instance in [20]. one can

relate the spinor propagator to the scalar greens function by the ansatz:

then the equation (9) for g becomes exactly as for the scalar greens function. the explicit solution
is found to be:

let us discuss the boundary term following for instance from the considerations in [19]. it is based on
the requirement to have well dened variational principle for the action under consideration. since
the dirac equations (7,8) are rst order dierential equations we cannot x simultaneously all the
components on the boundary but only half of them, + or . the regular boundary conditions
imply that we have xed ,  as a boundary data. in this case ( ) will serve as a source for
the correlation functions in the boudary theory but +( +) will be free to vary. the variation of the
dirac action in the class of eld congurations (18,19) will produce a surface term contribution:

sd = t + [0]onshell

1

2z ddx(cid:2)  (x) + (x) +  + (x)  (x)(cid:3) = s

(26)

where

t = 

therefore the full on-shell action with well dened variational principle will include a boundary term
and can be written as:

s[, ] = sd + s + sint

which gives the correct two point correlation function in cft of conformal operator with dimension
 = d+1
2 + m[10, 8, 19]. the other two terms in (27) can be expressed as perturbative series in terms
of 0 and 0. since these elds are connected to the boundary data (h)
(see eq.(24,25))
this would be a perturbative expansion in terms of (h)
. note that in calculating spinor
exchange one must use for internal lines the greens function given by eq.(20).

3 theory from irregular boundary conditions.

in this section we will follow the klebanov and wittens idea of taking irregular boundary conditions.
in considerations of the variational principle for spinor eld and from the asymptotic behavior of the
eld solutions (18,19) it follows that we can choose to x +( +) instead ( ) and the other
components to be free to vary. in the case of scalar eld [4, 5] it was shown that the resulting two

5

theories (with regular and irregular boundary conditions) are connected by a legendre transform. to
show that it is true also in the case of spinor eld let us consider the expression:

and this relations are valid to any order in perturbation theory. therefore, 
considered as conjugated and the same is true for the pair ( 
obviously the functional dened by a legendre transform:

0 , +

0 ).

0 and +

0 can be

j[, +; , +] = s[, ] z ddx(cid:2) + + +(cid:3)

(35)

possess a minimum with respect to variation of  and . at the extremal point, the functional
(35) is expressed in terms of + and + only. as it is clear from the preceeding discussion, + and
+ are related to the choice of irregular boundary conditions and klebanov and witten [4] proposed
to consider ads/cft correspondence principle based on the use of j[+, +] instead of s[, ].
let us compute the minimum of j and to see what kind of theory is induced on the boundary.

subsitution of s[, ] from (27) in (35) gives:

j(cid:2)+, +(cid:3) =

one can subsitute  and  into the rst term in eq. (36). the resulting functional takes the form:

(39)

(42)

where k means that in k m is replaced by m (see eq.(15)).

the rst term in (40) can be easily fourier transformed to the position space:

(41)

which coincide with the two point correlation function of an operator in the boundary cft with
dimension  = d+1
2 m. therefore, klebanov and wittens idea to dene ads/cft correspondence
by taking irregular boundary conditions will be formulated in our case by the formula:

ej[+, +] = hexpz (cid:2) o+ + +o(cid:3)i

note that in contrast to the scalar case, due to the specic asymptotics in the spinor case there is no
additional multiplier infront of the exponent on the right hand side of (42). using such a formulation
one can see that the greens function that must be used for the internal lines in calculating the higher
order graphs get modied and is dened by the expression in the square brackets multplying f (x)
and f (y) on the right hand side of (40):

s(x; y) = s(x; y) +z

dd~k
(2)d ei~k(~x~y)k(x, ~k) k(y, ~k)

(43)

let us analyse the modied greens function s(x; y). for this purpose we will use for i part of

s(x; y) (20) the following relations:

therefore, as in the bosonic case, the modied greens function s(x; y) is obtained by replacing m
with m. the new action that must be used in the ads/cft correspondence is:

let us summarize our considerations in the next section.

conclusions

in this acticle we generalized the klebanov and witten idea [4] (generalized to the interacting case in
[5]) to the spinor case. in [4] it was prposed to consider ads/cft correspondence for bosonic case

8

based on a legendre transformed action. as in the bosonic case, there are two possible choices of
boundary conditions for the spinor part of the action of ads supergarvity - regular and irregular. the
rst of them couples to the spinors (, ) operators with dimension ( d+1
2 + m) while the second
one couples to the spinors (+, +) operators with dimension ( d+1
2  m). the generating functional of
correlation functions are related by a legendre transform and this is true to all orders in perturbation
theory.

the greens function (20) that must be used for internal lines in calculating higher order graphs

is replaced by a modied greens function s(x; y) which explicit form is given by eq.(50).

it would be interesting to compare the results for spinor exchange and the transfer functions in
both theories [20, 23]. work in these topics is in progress. we hope to present analogous considerations
for the case of vector and rarita-schwinger elds in the near future [27].
