(9) note current depends gauge parameter gauge variations . property automatic order realize made particular choice noether potential, exploiting ambiguity denition {$9603060$} integration noether potential (8) boundary (spacelike) hypersurface leads surface charge, which, restricting gauge transformation parameters leave background invariant, equal noether charge usual sense. case hand surface charge remains constant variations continuously connect solutions equations motion. consider continuous variety solutions eld equations left invariant corresponding variety residual gauge transformations. hence, parameters characterize residual symmetry may change continuously solution. denoting combined change solution symmetry parameters variation , one may thus write () = 0 . (10) example noether current written function , one knows j(, ) remains proportional must therefore vanish area law corrections state counting supergravity 7 symmetric congurations. consequently q(, ) must vanish closed form, , surface charge obtained integration cauchy surface c volume element d, zc j (, ) = ic q(, ) , (11) constant variations induced . observe integrand right- hand side principle nonvanishing nonconstant, constancy total surface charge represents nontrivial result. general relativity one follows approach example. gauge transformations take form dieomorphisms residual gauge symmetries associated killing vectors. lagrangian invariant transforms density, implies n (, ) l. proceeding example discussed above, associated noether current gives rise noether potential. however, case number complications considering variations surface charge. another essential ingredient boundary decomposes two disconnected parts black hole solutions, one associated spatial innity one horizon. identifying surface charge constant variations within continuous variety solutions equations motion, contributions coming variations spatial innity must cancel coming horizon. phenomenon ensures validity rst law black hole mechanics: contributions originating spatial innity related variations black hole mass angular momentum, contributions originating horizon identied change black hole entropy (see  review). way one establishes formula black hole entropy terms surface charge noether potential horizon. lagrangian depends arbitrarily riemann tensor r (but derivatives) matter elds rst-order derivatives, one show entropy static black hole given  smacro = 1 16 2 ab cd (8l) rabcd , (12) epsilon tensors act subspace orthogonal horizon associated time radial coordinates; factor 8 related normalization conventions lagrangian. results one compute macroscopic entropy static, spherically symmetric, n = 2 supersymmetric black hole solutions presence higher- derivative interactions. view homogeneity function f , convenient introduce rescaled variables = ek/2 zx = ek z 2 a. horizon follows relation must = 64. electric/magnetic charges black hole given = ipi fi(y, ) fi( , ) = iqi . hand, follows (5) |z|2 = pifi(y, ) qiy i, determines value |z| terms (pi, qi). subsequently one establishes area law corrections state counting supergravity 8 expression entropy takes remarkably concise form {$9601029$}, smacro = h|z|2 + 4 im(cid:16) f(y, )(cid:17)i , = 64 .
