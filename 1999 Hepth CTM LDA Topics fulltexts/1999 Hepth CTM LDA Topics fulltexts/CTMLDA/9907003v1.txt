abstract

we probe the ads/cft correspondence by comparing the thermodynam-

ics of a rotating black hole in ve-dimensional anti-de sitter space with that of

a conformal eld theory on s3, whose parameters come from the boundary of

spacetime. in the high temperature limit, we nd agreement between gauge

theory and gravity in all thermodynamic quantities up to the same factor of

4/3 that appears for nonrotating holes.

i. introduction

one of the hallmarks of the duality revolution in string theory has been the linking

of apparently unrelated areas in physics via unexpected pathways. the ads/cft corre-

spondence [1] is a striking example of this; by analyzing dirichlet three-branes, it connects

gravity in a particular background to a strongly coupled gauge theory. more specically, the

correspondence says that iib string theory in a background of ve-dimensional anti-de sitter

space times a ve-sphere is dual to the large n limit of n = 4 supersymmetric yang-mills
theory in four dimensions. (see [2] for an extensive review of this vast subject.)

from a supergravity point of view, a dirichlet p-brane is simply a charged extended

black hole. moreover, the string theory description of d-branes allows one to determine its

world-volume action; to lowest order in  this is super yang-mills. in earlier work [3], the

entropy of the black brane solution was correctly given to within a numerical coecient by

the entropy of the eld theory on the brane. later, this match was extended to the case of

rotating branes [46].

the ads/cft correspondence extends the relationship between gauge theory and grav-

ity from providing a description of a particular brane solution to describing the physics of

the entire supergravity background by a dual conformal eld theory in one dimension less.

as such this realizes the principle of holography [7,8], the notion that the physics of the bulk

is imprinted on its boundary.

black holes provide an arena in which this correspondence between gravity and gauge

theory may be examined. for nonrotating ads black holes [9], the thermodynamics has been

described by thermal conformal eld theory [10]. recently a ve-dimensional rotating black

hole embedded in anti-de sitter space has been discovered [11]. since rotation introduces an

extra dimensionful parameter, the conformal eld theory entropy is not so tightly constrained

by the combination of extensivity and dimensional analysis; a successful correspondence

between thermodynamic quantities is much more nontrivial. our purpose in this paper,

therefore, is to probe the correspondence by extracting the thermodynamics of the new

rotating black hole from a dual conformal eld theory in four dimensions.

we begin by demonstrating the holographic nature of the duality for nonrotating black

holes: the thermodynamics of a nonrotating black hole in anti-de sitter space emerges

from a thermal conformal eld theory whose thermodynamic variables are read o from

the boundary of the black hole spacetime. in the high temperature limit, the eld theory

calculation gives the correct entropy of the hawking-page black hole up to a factor of 4/3.

2

we then describe the new rotating kerr-ads black hole solution and show how its ther-

modynamic properties can be recovered from the dual eld theory, in the high temperature

limit. in that limit, the entropy, energy and angular momentum, as derived from the statis-

tical mechanics of the eld theory, all agree with their gravitational counterparts, again up

to a common factor of 4/3.

ii. ads/cft correspondence for nonrotating holes

the ve-dimensional einstein-hilbert action with a cosmological constant is given by

i = 

1

16g5 z d5xg(cid:16)r + 12l2(cid:17) ,

(1)

where g5 is the ve-dimensional newton constant, r is the ricci scalar, the cosmological
constant is  = 6l2, and we have neglected a surface term at innity. anti-de sitter
solutions derived from this action can be embedded in ten-dimensional iib supergravity such
that the supergravity background is of the form ads5  s5. the ads/cft correspondence
then states that there is a dual conformal eld theory in four dimensions from which one

can extract the physics.

the line element of a schwarzschild black hole in anti-de sitter space [9] in ve space-

time dimensions can be written as

ds2 = (cid:18)1 

2mg5

r2 + r2l2(cid:19) dt2 +(cid:18)1 

this solution has a horizon at r = r+ where

1

2mg5

r2 + r2l2(cid:19)

dr2 + r2d2

3 .

(2)

r2
+ =

1

2l2 (cid:18)1 +q1 + 8mg5 l2(cid:19) .

(3)

the substitution  = it makes the metric positive denite and, by the usual removal of the

conical singularity at r+, yields a periodicity in  of

 =

2r+
1 + 2r2

+l2 ,

(4)

which is identied with the inverse temperature of the black hole. the entropy is given by

3

s =

a
4g5

=

2r3
+
2g5

,

(5)

where a is the area (that is 3-volume) of the horizon.

we shall take the dual conformal eld theory to be n = 4, u(n) super-yang-mills
theory. but since it is only possible to do calculations in the weak coupling regime, we shall

consider only the free eld limit of yang-mills theory. then, in the high-energy regime which

dominates the state counting, the spectrum of free elds on a sphere is essentially that of

blackbody radiation in at space, with 8n 2 bosonic and 8n 2 fermionic degrees of freedom.

the entropy is therefore

scft =

2
3

2n 2 vcft t 3

cft .

(6)

we would like to evaluate this holographically, i.e. by substituting physical data taken

from the boundary of the black hole spacetime. at xed r  r0  r+, the boundary line
element tends to

ds2  r2

0hl2dt2 + d2
3i .

the physical temperature at the boundary is consequently red-shifted to

while the volume is

tcft =

tbhgtt

=

tbh
lr0

,

vcft = 22r3
0 .

(7)

(8)

(9)

to obtain an expression for n, we invoke the ads/cft correspondence. originating in the

near horizon geometry of the d3-brane solution in iib supergravity, the correspondence [1],

relates n to the radius of s5 and the cosmological constant:

r2

s 5 = q4gs2n =

1
l2 .

(10)

then, since

4

we have

(2)7g2

s 4 = 16g10 = 16

4
l5 g5 ,

n 2 =



2l3g5

.

substituting the expressions for n, vcft and tcft into eq. (6), we obtain

!3
which, in the high temperature limit r+l  1, reduces to
sbh ,

+l2
l6g5   1 + 2r2

(11)

(12)

(13)

(14)

in agreement with the black hole result, eq. (5), but for a numerical factor of 4/3.

similarly, the red-shifted energy of the conformal eld theory matches the black hole

mass, modulo a coecient. the mass above the anti-de sitter background is

m  =

3
4

m .

(15)

this is the ads equivalent of the adm mass, or energy-at-innity. the corresponding

expression in the eld theory is

u 

cft = gtt

2
2

n 2 vcft t 4

cft =


2

r4
+l2 =

4
3

m  ,

(16)

where u 

cft is the conformal eld theory energy red-shifted to innity, and we have again
taken the r+l  1 limit. the 4/3 discrepancy in eqs. (5) and (16) is construed to be an
artifact of having calculated the gauge theory entropy in the free eld limit rather than in

the strong coupling limit required by the correspondence; intuitively, one expects the free

energy to decrease when the coupling increases. the 4/3 factor was rst noticed in the

context of d3-brane thermodynamics [3]. our approach diers in that we take the idea of

holography at face value, by explicitly reading physical data from the boundary of spacetime;

nonetheless, eq. (12) refers to an underlying brane solution.

at this level, the correspondence only goes through in the high temperature limit. since

the only two scales in the thermal conformal eld theory are r0 and tcft, high temperature

means that tcft  1/r0, allowing us to neglect nite-size eects.

iii. five-dimensional rotating ads black holes

the general rotating black hole in ve dimensions has two independent angular momenta.

here we consider the case of a rotating black hole with one angular momentum in an ambient

ads space. the line element is [11]

ds2 = 



2  dt 

a sin2 

a

d!2

+

 sin2 

2

 a dt 

(r2 + a2)



d!2

+

dr2 +

d2 + r2 cos2  d2 ,

where 0  ,   2 and 0    /2, and

 = (cid:16)r2 + a2(cid:17)(cid:16)1 + r2l2(cid:17)  2mg5
 = 1  a2l2 cos2 
2 = r2 + a2 cos2 

 = 1  a2l2 .

this solution is an anti-de sitter space with curvature given by

rab = 4l2gab .

the horizon is at

r2
+ =

1

2l2 (cid:18)(1 + a2l2) +q(1 + a2l2)2 + 8mg5 l2(cid:19) ,

which can be inverted to give

m =

1
2

(r2

+ + a2)(1 + r2

+l2) .

the entropy is one-fourth the area of the horizon:

s =

1

2g5

+ + a2(cid:17) r+
2(cid:16)r2
(1  a2l2)

.

(17)

(18)

(19)

(20)

(21)

(22)

the entropy diverges in two dierent limits: r+   and a2l2  1. the rst of these
descibes an innite temperature and innite radius black hole, while the second corresponds

6

to critical angular velocity, at which the einstein universe at innity has to rotate at the

speed of light. the inverse hawking temperature is

 =

2(cid:16)r2

+ + a2(cid:17)

r+ (1 + a2l2 + 2r2

+l2)

.

the mass above the anti-de sitter background is now

m  =

3
4

m ,

the angular velocity at the horizon is

h =

a
+ + a2 ,
r2

and the angular momentum is dened as

j =

1

16 zs

abcdededsabc =

ma
22

,

(23)

(24)

(25)

(26)

is the killing vector conjugate to the angular momentum in the  direction,

(cid:17)a
where a = (cid:16) 
t(cid:17)a
and s is the boundary of a hypersurface normal to(cid:16) 

on s.

, with dsabc being the volume element

following methods discussed in [9,12], one can derive a nite action for this solution from

the regularized spacetime volume after an appropriate matching of hypersurfaces at large r.

the result is

i =

2(cid:16)r2

+ + a2(cid:17)2

(1  r2
4r+(1 + a2l2 + 2r2

+l2)
+l2)

.

(27)

as noted in [12], the action changes sign at r+l = 1, signalling the presence of a phase

transition in the conformal eld theory. for r+l > 1, the theory is in an unconned phase

and has a free energy proportional to n 2. one can also check that the action satises the

thermodynamic relation

s = (m   jh )  i .

(28)

it is interesting to note that, by formally dividing both the free energy, f = i/, and the

mass by an arbitrary volume, one obtains an equation of state:

7

p =

1
3

+l2  1
r2
r2
+l2 + 1

 ,

(29)

where p = f/v is the pressure, and  is the energy density. in the limit r+l  1 that we
have been taking, this equation becomes

p =

1
3

 ,

(30)

as is appropriate for the equation of state of a conformal theory. this suggests that if a

conformal eld theory is to reproduce the thermodynamic properties of this gravitational

solution, it has to be in such a limit.

iv. the dual cft description

the gauge theory dual to supergravity on ads5  s5 is n = 4 super yang-mills with

gauge group u(n) where n tends to innity [1]. the action is

s = z d4xg tr 

1
4g2 f 2 +

1
2

(d)2 +

1
12

r2 +  /d! .

(31)

all elds take values in the adjoint representation of u(n). the six scalars, , transform

under so(6) r-symmetry, while the four weyl fermions, , transform under su(4), the spin

cover of so(6). the scalars are conformally coupled; otherwise, all elds are massless. we

shall again take the free eld limit. the angular momentum operators can be computed from

the relevant components of the stress energy tensor in spherical coordinates. this approach

is to be contrasted with [46,13] in which generators of r-rotations are used corresponding

to spinning d-branes.

the free energy of the gauge theory is given by

fcft = +tcftxi

iz 

0

dliz dm

i z dm

i ln(cid:18)1  ie(im

i )(cid:19) ,

(32)

where i labels the particle species,  = +1 for bosons and -1 for fermions, li is the quantum

number associated with the total orbital angular momentum of the ith particle, and m()

i

is

its angular momentum component in the () direction. here  plays the role of a voltage

8

while the chemical potential m serves to constrain the total angular momentum of the

system.

the free energy is easiest to evaluate in a corotating frame, which corresponds to the

constant-time foliation choice of hypersurfaces orthogonal to ta. since, at constant r = r0,

the boundary has the metric

ds2 = r2

0"l2dt2 +

2al2 sin2 



dt d +

sin2 



d2 +

+ cos2  d2# ,

the constant-time slices of the corotating frame have a spatial volume of

the spectrum of a conformally coupled eld on s3 is essentially given by

v =

1  a2l2 .

l 

l
r0

,

(33)

(34)

(35)

where l is the quantum number for total orbital angular momentum. eq. (32) can now be

evaluated by making use of the identities

z

dx xn ln(cid:16)1  ex+c(cid:17) = (n + 1)lin+2(ec) = (n + 1)
z dx x li2(eax+c) = 

xk=1
a2 hax li3(eax+c) + li4(eax+c)i ,

1

k=

ekc
kn+2 ,

where lin is the nth polylogarithmic function, dened by the sum above. the result is

fcft =

yielding an entropy of

scft =

cft .

the physical temperature that enters the conformal eld theory is

tcft =

1
lr0

tbh .

similarly, the angular velocity is scaled to

9

(36)

(37)

(38)

(39)

cft =

al2
lr0

.

(40)

substituting eqs. (39) and (40) into eq. (38) and taking the high temperature limit as

before, we have

scft =

2

2r3
+

3g5

(1  a2l2)

=

4

sbh .

(41)

the inclusion of rotation evidently does not aect the ratio of the black hole and eld theory

entropies.

in the corotating frame, the free energy is simply of the form n 2v t 4, with the volume

given by eq. (34). however, with respect to a nonrotating ads space, the free energy takes

a more complicated form since now the volume is simply 22r3

0. by keeping this volume and

the temperature xed, one may calculate the angular momentum of the system with respect

to the nonrotating background:

j cft
 = 

f

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)v,tcft

in the usual r+l  1 limit, we obtain

ar4

+(cid:16)1 + a2l2 + 2r2
+ + a2)4

48l62 (r2

+l2(cid:17)4

=

.

(42)

j cft
 =

2ma
32 =

4
3

j bh


,

(43)

so that the gauge theory angular momentum is proportional to the black hole angular mo-

mentum, eq. (26), with a factor of 4/3.

the black hole mass formula, eq.

(24), refers to the energy above the nonrotating

anti-de sitter background. we should therefore compare this quantity with the red-shifted

energy in the conformal eld theory. here a slight subtlety enters. since the statistical

mechanical calculation gives the energy in the corotating frame, we must add the center-of-

mass rotational energy before comparing with the black hole mass. then we nd that

u 

cft = gtt (ucorotating + jcftcft) =

4
3

m  ,

(44)

with m  given by eq. (24), evaluated at high temperature.

10

v. discussion

there are two interesting aspects of these results. the rst is that the same relative

factor that appears in the entropy appears in the angular momentum and the energy. a

priori, one has no reason to believe that the functional form of the free energy will be such

as to guarantee this result (see, for example, [4]). the second is that the relative factor of

4/3 in the entropy is unaected by rotation. indeed, one could expand the entropy of the

rotating system in powers and inverse powers of the t hooft coupling. the correspondence

implies that

scft = xm

amm = xn

bn  1

!n

= sbh .

(45)

we may approximate the series on the gauge theory side as a0 and on the gravity side as b0.

then, generically, we would expect these coecients to be functions of the dimensionless

rotational parameter  so that a0() = f ()b0() with f ( = 1) = 4/3. our somewhat

unexpected result is that f () = 4/3 has, in fact, no dependence on .
