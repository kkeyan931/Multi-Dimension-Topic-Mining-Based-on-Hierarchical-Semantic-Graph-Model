abstract

we present a class of two-charged intersecting brane solutions of the d = 11 super-

gravity, which contain the m 2-brane, m 5-brane, kaluza-klein monopole or brinkmann

wave as their building blocks. these solutions share the common feature that one charge

is smeared out or uniform over all spatial directions occupied by the branes or waves, while

the other charge is localized in them.

1. introduction

the bosonic part of 11 dimensional supergravity [1] contains the metric tensor and a

3-form gauge potential whose eld strength is a 4-form. it is known that there are four

basic classical solutions in this theory: the m 2-brane [2], m 5-brane [3], brinkmann wave

[4] and kaluza-klein monopole [5]. the m 2-brane has a natural coupling to the 3-form

gauge potential and carries electric 4-form charge. the m 5-brane is the magnetic dual of

the m 2-brane and carries magnetic 4-form charge. the brinkmann wave and kaluza-klein

monopole, on the other hand, are purely gravitational, i.e., the 3-form gauge potential is

identically zero for them. the four solutions share some common features: they are bps

states and preserve 1/2 of the supersymmetries, the solutions are described by a harmonic

function in the transverse space and parallel branes/waves can be superposed. for a review

of these bps branes, see [6].

one can further superpose the four basic objects to obtain various composite bps

solutions [7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15]. dierent components in the solution can be of the

same type of objects or dierent types. we will refer to the relative transverse directions

of a brane as those orthogonal to the brane but tangent to some other brane, and the

common transverse directions as those orthogonal to all branes. most of the solutions

that have been discussed are the all smeared out solutions where dierent components

of the composite are smeared out in their relative transverse directions. such solutions

are described by several independent harmonic functions, each one is associated with a

dierent component, which means one can superpose dierent components in arbitrary

way.

there has also been some discussions that generalize the all smeared out solutions

to localized or partially localized ones [16,17,13,18]. one such solution [13] describes the

superposition of n s5-brane and fundamental string in type ii supergravity, with the fun-

damental string parallel to the n s5-brane and localized in the four relative transverse

directions. the n s5-brane is described by the usual harmonic function and the equation

describing the fundamental string is modied compared with the smeared out case. if we

lift this solution (more precisely the type iia one) up to 11 dimensions, it becomes the su-

perposition of m 2-brane and m 5-brane. the m 2-brane and m 5-brane intersect at a line,

the m 5-brane is smeared out in its relative transverse direction (which is the direction of

the dimensional reduction), while the m 2-brane is localized in its relative transverse direc-

tions. this solution is in fact a special case of a more general solution [13] which describes

1

two n s5-branes intersecting at a line with fundamental strings superposed parallel to the

intersecting line, the two n s5-branes are each localized in their relative transverse space.

another solution that has been discussed is the superposition of d5-brane, d1-brane and

gravitational waves traveling parallel to the d1-brane [17].

in this paper, we study further such localized solutions in 11 dimensional supergravity.

for simplicity, we will just consider solutions with two charges (i.e., with two components).

the common feature of these solutions is that one charge is uniform or smeared out and the

other charge is localized in its relative transverse directions. we will obtain the following

four solutions:

(i) m 2-brane + nonuniform wave (the wave is parallel to one of the spatial directions

of the brane and localized in the other direction);

(ii) m 2  m 2(0) with one m 2-brane smeared out in its relative transverse directions
and the other one localized in its relative transverse directions, the notation m 2  m 2(0)
means that the two m 2-branes intersect at a point;

(iii) m 5-brane + nonuniform wave;

(iv) kaluza-klein monopole + nonuniform wave.

these four solutions plus the m 2  m 5(1) solution mentioned previously are basic,
in that they are independent and can not be deduced from each other by dualities. from

these basic solutions, we can derive other two-charged congurations by u-duality [19],
which include m 5  m 5(3), m 2  k.k.(2)(kaluza-klein monopole), m 5  k.k.(5).
more specically, we can start from the basic solutions, smear them out in extra dimensions

if necessary, go down to 10 dimensions, perform the u-duality transformations in type ii

supergravity and lift them up back to 11 dimensions.

we should point out that although we are using the word localized solution, what

we have obtained (and what has often been discussed before) is the form of the localized

solution in terms of two functions which satisfy simple equations. we have not tried to

nd explicit analytical solutions to these equations in this paper. for all the solutions, the

two equations associated with the two charges are similar to those of the n s5-brane and

fundamental string.

we present the four basic solutions in the section ii and discuss some relevant issues

in section iii.

2. the four localized two-charged solutions

in this section, we discuss in turn the supergravity solutions of m2-brane with nonuni-

form wave, m2-brane intersecting m2-brane, m5-brane with nonuniform wave and kaluza-

klein monopole with nonuniform wave. we will consider the rst two cases in detail and

be brief about the latter two cases.

2.1. m 2-brane with nonuniform wave

we start with the bosonic part of d = 11 supergravity

s11 = z d11xhg(cid:0)r

48

f 2(cid:1) +

f  f  ai.

(2.1)

a is a 3-form gauge potential with a gauge transformation a = d,  is a 2-form. f = da

is the corresponding 4-form eld strength, in components f = 4[a]. the third
term in the lagrangian is invariant under the gauge transformation of the 3-form up to a

total derivative. the equations of motion are

rm n = tm n ,

tm n =

(2.2)

qf m np q

2(4!)2 m np q1q2q3q4r1r2r3r4 fq1q2q3q4 fr1r2r3r4 = 0.

the second term in the last equation vanishes for the solutions considered in this section.

the last equation is therefore simplied to be

q(cid:0)gf m np q(cid:1) = 0

the m 2-brane solution takes the form

m (cid:0)dt2 + dz2 + dy2(cid:1) + h 1/3

m dxidxi,

ds2

11 = h 2/3
atzy = h 1
m ,
hm = hm (xi), 2

xhm = 0.

i = 1, 2, ..., 8,

(2.3)

(2.4)

the rest of the components of the 3-form potential are zero except the ones related to

atzy by symmetry. we can obtain solutions describing n parallel m 2-branes located at
dierent points in the transverse space by choosing hm to be

h = 1 +

n

xk=1

ak
r6
k

, rk = |~x  ~xk|,

3

(2.5)

where ~xk, k = 1, 2, ..., n are locations of the branes.

the brinkmann wave solution is purely gravitational. it exists in gravitational theory

in any dimensions and in 11 dimensions the solution is given by

11 = hdt2 + dz2 + (hw  1)(dt  dz)2i + dxidxi,
ds2
hw = hw (xi), 2

xhw = 0,

i = 1, 2, ..., 9,

(2.6)

which describes the wave traveling in the z direction.

the m 2-brane can be superposed with a gravitational wave smeared along the brane,

the metric of which takes the form

ds2

11 = h 2/3

m hdt2 + dz2 + dy2 + (hw  1)(dt  dz)2i + h 1/3

m dxidxi,

(2.7)

i = 1, 2, ..., 8.

the 3-form potential and hm are still given by (2.4). hw , however, is only a harmonic
function of the eight common transverse directions, hw = hw (xi), 2
xhw = 0, which
means the wave is uniform in the y direction. note we can superpose the m 2-brane and

the wave in an arbitrary way, in particular the wave does not have to live in the brane.

this is associated with the fact that the solution preserves 1/4 of the supersymmetries.

we now show that this solution can be generalized to the case where the wave does de-

pend on the y coordinate. we make the ansatz that the metric and the 3-form potential are

still given by (2.4) and hm = hm (xi), but with the modication that hw = hw (xi, y).

first we consider the equation of motion of the 3-form potential. the nonzero compo-

nents of the 4-form eld strength are ftzyxi, which depends on hm only. the nonzero com-
ponents in the upper index form are also f tzyxi . moreover, f tzyxi also just depend on hm .
this can be understood from the fact that locally the presence of the (hw  1)(dt  dz)2
term corresponds to an innite boost in the z direction, but the component values of ftzyxi
or f tzyxi do not change under boosts in the z direction. for the same reason, g does

not depend on hw neither. so the equation of motion of the 3-form potential is com-
pletely independent of hw , irrespectively of whether hw depends on the y coordinate or
not. thus it simply reduces to 2

xhm = 0, as in the pure m 2-brane case.

next we consider the equation of motion of the metric tensor. straightforward calcu-

we have listed here only the necessary components of t m n and r m n . the unlisted
components are either zero or can be obtained by symmetries of the tensors. we see that
the terms in r m n involving products of rst derivatives of hm are precisely canceled
by t m n . the remaining terms in r m n are always linear combinations of 2
xhm and
xhw + hm 2
(cid:0)2
yhw(cid:1). this means the equations of motion for the 3-form potential and

the metric are reduced to

2
xhm = 0, 2

xhw + hm 2

yhw = 0.

(2.9)

if we let hw to be independent of the y coordinate, the solution is just the uniform
wave case, the equations decouple and become linear. if hw depends on the y coordinate,

5

the equation becomes nonlinear and in general the principle of superposition does not

apply. the relation between hm and hw is asymmetric and we can think of hm as being
a background for hw .

2.2. m 2-brane intersecting m 2-brane

the solution describing two orthogonal m 2-branes intersecting at a point with both

branes smeared out in their relative transverse directions takes the form

11 = h 2/3
ds2
+ h 1/3

2

dt2 + h 1/3

(cid:0)dy2

1 + dy2
2(cid:1)

(2.10)

h1 = h1(xi), h2 = h2(xi),
2
xh1 = 0, 2

xh2 = 0.

the rest of the components of the 3-form potential are zero except the ones related to

atz1z2 and aty1y2 by symmetries. the m 2-brane associated with h1 extends in the y1, y2
direction and is smeared out in the z1, z2 direction and the m 2-brane associated with h2
extends in the z1, z2 direction and is smeared out in the y1, y2 direction. the two kinds
of m 2-brane can be superposed in an arbitrary way, in particular they do not have to

intersect.

now we generalize this solution to the case where one m 2-brane is smeared out in

its relative transverse directions while the other m 2-brane is fully localized in its relative

transverse directions. we make the ansatz that the metric and the 3-form potential are

still given by (2.10) and h1 = h1(xi), but with the modication that h2 = h2(xi, y1, y2).
so the solution describes the m 2-brane associated with h1 being smeared out in the z1, z2
directions while the one associated with h2 being localized in the y1, y2 directions.

let us consider the equation of motion of the 3-form potential rst. by the ansatz

the 4-form eld strength is given by

the equation of motion of the 3-form potential is readily seen to be reduced to

(2.16)
we have listed only the necessary components of t m n and r m n . the unlisted com-
ponents are either zero or can be obtained by symmetries of the tensors. we see the same
pattern as in the case of m 2-brane with wave. the terms in r m n involving product of
rst derivatives of hm are precisely canceled by t m n . the remaining terms in r m n are
always linear combinations of 2
y h1(cid:1). thus the ansatz is solved by

xh1 and (cid:0)2

xh1 + h22

(2.14).

again the relation between h1 and h2 is asymmetric. we have tried to generalize the
ansatz by letting h1 = h1(xi, z1, z2), h2 = h2(xi, y1, y2) and still assuming the metric
and the 3-form potential are given by (2.10) . we found that the most general solution

is what we have obtained, i.e., we need one of the two m 2-branes to be smeared out in

its relative transverse directions. to nd the solution of both m 2-branes being localized

needs to go beyond this ansatz.

8

2.3. m 5-brane with nonuniform wave

the magnetic dual of the m 2-brane is the m 5-brane, which carries magnetic 4-form

charge. the solution describing the m 5-brane superposed with the brinkmann wave

smeared out along the brane takes the form

ds2

11 = h 1/3

m hdt2 + dz2 + (hw  1)(dt  dz)2 + dydyi + h 2/3

m dxidxi,

 = 1, 2, 3, 4, i = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5

fi1i2i3i4 = i1i2i3i4i5 i5hm ,

hm = hm (xi), hw = hw (xi),
xhm = 0, 2
2

xhw = 0,

(2.17)

where i1i2i3i4i5 is the at 5th rank totally antisymmetric tensor of the transverse space
and all other components of the 4-form eld strength are zero. hm and hw are two
independent harmonic functions associated with the m 5-brane and the wave. the wave

travels in the z-direction.

if we set hw equal to 1, the solution reduces to the pure

m 5-brane case.

similar to the m 2-brane case, to obtain the nonuniform wave solution, we let hw =
hw (xi, y) and assume the metric and the 4-form eld strength are given by (2.17). the
equation of motion and the bianchi identity of the 4-form eld strength are untouched by

this modication (or for that matter, they are untouched by adding the wave at all). the
calculation of r m n and t m n shows the same pattern as before. the rst derivative terms
in r m n are canceled by t m n and the remaining terms in r m n are linear combinations
of 2

xhw + hm 2

yhw(cid:1). thus the nonuniform wave solution is given by
2
xhm = 0, 2

xhw + hm 2

yhw = 0.

(2.18)

xhm and (cid:0)2

2.4. kaluza-klein monopole with nonuniform wave

the kaluza-klein monopole solution in 11 dimensions takes the form

ds2

11 = dt2 + dydy + hk dxidxi + h 1

k (cid:0)dx5 + aidxi(cid:1)2

i = 1, 2, 3,

hk = hk(xi), 2

xhk = 0,

xi hk = ijkxj ak,

,  = 1, 2, ..., 6,

(2.19)

9

where x5 is periodically identied.
if we suppress the y,  = 1, 2, ..., 6, the solution
describes magnetic monopoles in the 4 + 1 dimensional kaluza-klein theory, where the ai
is the gauge eld of the monopoles. adding back the ys, the monopoles become 6-branes
in 11 dimensions.

gravitational wave can be added to the kaluza-klein monopole along one of the

spatial directions of the brane. the metric takes the form

ds2

11 = dt2 + dz2 + (hw  1) (dt  dz)2 + dydy + hk dxidxi

(2.20)

+ h 1

k (cid:0)dx5 + aixi(cid:1)2

,  = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,

i = 1, 2, 3,

where the wave travels in the z-direction and is smeared out along the ys. hw is the
harmonic function of the wave, hw = hw (xi), 2
xhw = 0. hk and ai are the same as
in (2.19).

now we modify hw to be hw = hw (xi, y) and assume the metric is still given by
(2.20). since the solution is purely gravitational, the only equations of motion need to be

satised are rm n = 0. upon computing the ricci tensor of the metric (2.20), we nd
that the terms involving hw always come in the form 2
yhw and rm n = 0
is reduced to

xhw + hk 2

2
xhw + hk2

yhw = 0

(2.21)

plus the equations in (2.19).

3. discussions

we have obtained a class of classical solutions to the 11 dimensional supergravity.

these solution carry two charges and can be viewed as superposition of the basic com-

ponents: the m 2-brane, m 5-brane, brinkmann wave and kaluza-klein monopole. they

share the common feature that one charge is localized in its relative transverse dimensions

while the other is smeared out in its relative transverse dimensions(in the case of super-

position of two branes) or uniform (in the case of superposition of a brane and a wave).

it is likely that these solutions all preserve 1/4 of supersymmetries, although we have not

checked the supersymmetric variations for all of them.

dimensionally reducing these solutions gives various solutions in type ii supergravity.

let us consider some examples.

if we start with the m 2 + wave solution and dimen-

sionally reduce along the wave direction, we get the solution of d0-brane localized in

10

f-string(fundamental string). if we smear the m 2 + wave out in one more dimension and
reduce in that dimension, we get d2(d2brane) + wave. start from the m 2  m 2(0)
solution and reduce along one of spatial direction of the localized brane, we get d2 + f -

string with the d2-brane smearing out along the f -string and the f -string localized in the

brane. t-dualize it along the f -string, we end up with d3 + wave in iib. starting from

m 5 + wave and reducing along the wave direction gives us d4 + d0 with the d0-brane

localized in the d4-brane. if we smear out m 5 + wave in one more dimension and reduce

along it, we get n s5 + wave in iia. also start from m 5 + wave, if we let the wave to be

independent of one of the spatial directions along the m 5-brane and reduce along it, we
get d4 + wave. dimensionally reducing the k.k. + wave along the s1 of the kaluza-klein

monopole gives us the d6+wave. the d5 + wave solution is u-dual to n s5 + f -string

in iia, which can be obtained from m 2 + m 5(1) by dimensional reduction, as discussed

in the introduction. so all dp-branes with p = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 can carry nonuniform wave.

as mentioned in the introduction, other two-charged solutions, such as m 5  m 5(3),
m 2  k.k.(2), m 5  k.k.(5)(m 2  m 5(1) with the m 2 smeared out and m 5-brane
localized is also one), are not independent but can be obtained by u-duality. for example,
the m 5  m 5(3) is equivalent to d4  d4(2) (in the sense of dimensional reduction),
which in turn is t -dual to d4 + d0 smeared out in two more dimensions.

one can certainly try to generalize these localized solutions to more than two charges.

in fact, certain multiply charged solutions have already been considered in the context of

type ii supergravity [17]. we expect that more of such solutions exist in 11 dimensional

supergravity. a more important question is to nd the fully localized solutions of brane

intersection. it seems that to nd them we need to go beyond the ansatz made in this

paper.
