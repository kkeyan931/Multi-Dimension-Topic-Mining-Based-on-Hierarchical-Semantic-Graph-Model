abstract

according to the ads/cft correspondence, the strong coupling limit of large n
n = 4 supersymmetric gauge theory at nite temperature is described by asymptotically
anti de sitter black holes. these black holes exist with planar, spherical and hyperbolic
horizon geometries. we concentrate on the hyperbolic and spherical cases and probe
the associated gauge theories with d3-branes and wilson loops. the d3-brane probe
reproduces the coupling of the scalars in the gauge theory to the background geometry
and we nd thermal stabilization in the hyperbolic case. we investigate the vacuum
expectation value of wilson loops with particular emphasis on the screening length at
nite temperature. we nd that the thermal phase transition of the theory on the sphere
is not related to screening phenomena.

1. introduction

maldacenas conjecture [1] states that su (n ) n = 4 supersymmetric gauge theory
in four dimensions is dual to type iib string theory on an ads5  s5 background. this
conjecture is obtained by considering a collection of n d3-branes in type iib string theory.
the eective theory describing the physics of the d3-branes is n = 4 su (n ) yang-mills.
d3-branes can also be described as classical black hole solutions in iib supergravity. taking
  0 and at the same time keeping the mass of the strings stretched between the d3-
branes nite denes the near horizon limit of the supergravity solution. on the other hand
one is keeping only the ground states of the open strings. this gives n = 4 gauge theory
as the exact theory (not only the eective theory for low energies) and the ads5  s5
background as the near horizon limit in the supergravity solution.

the same arguments apply not only to extremal but also to near-extremal d3-branes
[2]. one obtains then asymptotically anti de sitter black holes with planar horizon geom-
etry. the euclidean continuation of these black hole solutions is conjectured to describe a
thermal state of the n = 4 gauge theory with a temperature corresponding to the hawk-
ing temperature of the black hole [1,3]. much work has been devoted to the study of this
duality, see e.g. [4] for a review.

the supergravity solution is however only an approximation to string theory and cor-
responds to the large n and strong coupling limit in the dual gauge theory. a direct
comparison of quantities calculated at weak coupling in the gauge theory with the cor-
responding results in the supergravity theory is therefore rather dicult. however many
quantities calculated at strong coupling have been shown to be consistent at the qualitative
level with general expectations from gauge theories. among the quantities that have been
studied for near-extremal d3-branes are eective potentials obtained through d3-brane
probes [5,6] and vacuum expectation values of wilson loops corresponding to the action
of strings ending on the conformal boundary of the ads black hole [7,8,9,10,11].

black holes in ads space can have spherical, planar or hyperbolic horizon geometries.
although only the planar black holes can be directly related to d3-branes in a thermal
state, one expects that also the spherical and hyperbolic black holes describe gauge theories.
more specically in [3] it was conjectured that spherical black holes describe n = 4 gauge
theories at nite temperature on s3. one also expects that ads black holes with hyperbolic
horizon describe n = 4 gauge theory on the hyperbolic three-plane h 3. we will further
investigate these conjectures. in section 2 we will compute the static potential for a test
d3-brane in the background of spherical or hyperbolic ads black holes. we nd that
at large distances the static potential reproduces the tree level coupling of the scalars to
the background geometry in the gauge theory. since in the hyperbolic case this coupling
induces a negative mass term one would expect the gauge theory to be unstable. the d3-
brane potential at nite temperature grows however for small distances up to a maximum

1

value and only for large distances reproduces the negative mass term in the gauge theory.
at zero temperature there is however no such stabilization and one nds only the tree level
negative mass term 1.

in section 3 we turn to the properties of wilson loops. we nd screening at nite
temperature on the sphere and at zero temperature a potential that is very close to the form
of the potential at weak coupling. we also speculate about the relation of the screening
length at nite temperature and the thermal phase transition between the spherical ads
black hole and empty ads space. in the hyperbolic case we nd screening even at zero
temperature.

2. probing ads black holes with d-branes

where  is the radius of curvature of the asymptotic ads geometry and  is proportional to

to the spherical, planar or hyperbolic cases respectively. in the following we will always
consider k = 1 or k = 1. d2

with hyperbolic horizon has been found in [12].

2 we take a yang-mills term for the ve-form action with the convention of imposing self-

duality at the level of the equations of motion.

where u+ is the horizon radius

(2.5)

the temperature associated to (2.2) is t = 1
 . since the boundary of asymptotically ads
metrics is only dened up to conformal transformations [13], we have chosen (2.2) such
that the boundary 3-sphere or 3-hyperboloid has radius one. although an arbitrary radius
r can be set by redening u = ru and  =  /r, the thermodynamics will only depend on
the ratio s 1 /r given by (2.4).

the black hole metrics (2.2) with k = 1 only exist for t  tmin =

2
 , which
corresponds to  = 3
4 . for each temperature bigger than tmin there are two solutions for
4 and one smaller. we will only consider mass parameters   3
, one bigger than 3
4 . black
holes with smaller values of  have negative specic heat. they decay due to hawking
radiation and do not correspond to a stable thermal state in the gauge theory. there is
furthermore a phase transition at crit = 2, or equivalently

tcrit =

3
2

.

(2.6)

for temperatures below tcrit the black hole solution is unstable due to tunneling to empty
ads-space [14]. the gauge theory interpretation is that of a conning/deconning phase
transition [13,3]. the free energy of the black hole solutions scales like n 2, consistent with
the expected deconnement at nite temperatures in the gauge theory. for temperatures
t < tcrit the eld theory dual is empty ads. its free energy scales like n 0, signalling
connement. we will discuss this phase transition in more detail in section 3.

for k = 1 the horizon radius is dened even for negative mass parameters down
to  =  1
4 . lorentzian black holes with negative mass parameter have also an inner
horizon and a timelike singularity such that their penrose diagram is that of the reissner-
nordstrom ads solution [15]. at the extremal case  =  1
4 inner and outer horizon
coincide. the nature of the horizon changes, it becomes a bifurcate horizon with no
particular temperature associated to it. thus the extremal solution is somewhat similar to
empty ads in the poincare patch and can be associated with the zero temperature ground
state of n = 4 yang-mills on the hyperboloid [16,17]. the fact that the groundstate
is given by a solution with negative mass parameter and its implications concerning the
entropy of the corresponding gauge theory have been discussed in [18] and the eld theory
1-loop calculation of the free energy has been performed recently in [18,19].

taking the metrics (2.2) as input for a freund-rubin like ansatz [20] we nd that the
length scale  is determined by the ve-form ux through s5 as 4 = 4gsn 2 and the
potential of the ve-form eld strength is given by

a4 = 4u4d d3,k ,

3

(2.7)

where d3,k is the unit volume form on either s3 or h 3. notice that the metrics (2.2) are
not derived as near-horizon limits of d3-branes on an asymptotically at space.

n = 4 yang-mills theory in at space has a coulomb branch of vacua on which
the gauge group is broken to a smaller group of equal rank.
in d-brane language this
translates into forces between parallel extremal at d3-branes being zero. separating d3-
branes in the transverse space dimensions corresponds to turn on higgs expectation values
in the gauge theory. at nite temperature the eld theory develops an eective potential
which lifts the coulomb branch and drives the system back to symmetry restauration [21].
accordingly, forces between near-extremal d3-branes do not cancel. a symmetry breaking
pattern u (n + 1)  u (n ) u (1) is given in the gravity description by separating a single
d3-brane from the rest. the eective action of such a conguration can be computed as
the action of the single d3-brane in the background of the other n branes

s = t3z (cid:16)pg + a4(cid:17) ,

(2.8)

where t3 is the d3-brane tension, g the induced metric on the probe world-volume and
a4 is the background value of the type iib four-form potential. this calculation has been
done in [5] and [6] and qualitative agreement with the expectations from gauge theory has
been found. in this section we want to extend this analysis to the spherical and hyperbolic
cases. the main dierence with the at case is that the n = 4 scalars can get mass due
to a non-minimal coupling to the boundary geometry,

(2.9)

therefore we expect a non-zero eective potential even at zero temperature. since the
boundary geometry is only dened as a conformal class, the n = 4 scalars should be
conformally coupled, i.e.  = 1/6.

we consider a test d3-brane at a distance u from the origin. substituting (2.2) and

(2.7) in the born infeld action (2.8) we obtain 3

3 in [5,6] the authors worked with asymptotically at geometries describing near-extremal 3-
branes solutions. in dening the probe action, they subtracted the 3-brane volume at innity. we

are directly working in asymptotically ads spaces and the d3-brane action at innity does not

become a constant therefore no such subtraction can be done. our expression for k = 0 coincides

with [5] and up to a constant also with [6].

where we used t3 = 1
224 [22]. to compare this to the gauge theory in (2.9)
we introduce the t hooft coupling  = 2g2
y m n and identify it on the the supergravity
side through 4 = 2. the radial coordinate u is then related to the higgs expectation
value by u
[23,5,6]. the curvature of a unit 3-sphere or 3-hyperboloid is r = 6k.
substituting these values in (2.9) with  = 1/6, we obtain precisely (2.11). thus we recover
at large u precisely the tree-level coupling of the scalar elds to the background curvature
in the gauge theory. at rst glance it seems surprising that this term does not suer
some non-trivial renormalization since supersymmetry is broken by both the background
geometry and the temperature. at large u we are however probing the ultraviolet properties
of the gauge theory. since n = 4 yang-mills on s1s3 or s1h 3 has vanishing conformal
anomaly, in the large u limit we expect to probe the bare couplings of the n = 4 gauge
theory. this result is an example for the suggestion that large distances in the bulk
correspond to small distance scales on the boundary [24].

it is interesting to analyze the large u behaviour of the potential when the dual gauge
theory lives on an space with non-vanishing conformal anomaly. we will consider as an
example ads5 with s4 boundary of radius one. the metric is

where v4 is the volume of s4. the curvature of a four-sphere of radius one is 12. the rst
term in (2.14) reproduces the conformal coupling of the scalars to the background curvature
with the same identication between u and  as before. we associate the second term to
the conformal anomaly. the trace anomaly of n = 4 on s4 is t = 3n 2
82 [25] and thus the
eective action picks up a logarithmic term [26]

with  playing the part of the momentum cuto. the coecient that multiplies the loga-
rithm in (2.14) is precisely the leading o(n ) term in tn  tn+1. the variable u sets the
energy scale in the eld theory at which the gauge group is higgsed from su (n +1) to
su (n ). it is therefore u what substitutes the cuto  in (2.14).

the identication of u with the vacuum expectation value of the scalar elds is only
correct at large u. it has been argued [23] that in order to compare radial distances in
supergravity with energy scales in the gauge theory one should use an isotropic coordinate

(2.19)

if we add one d3-brane the free energy changes by an amount fn+1  fn . the leading
o(n ) term of this change is precisely given by (2.18) after discarding the quadratically
divergent term. the quadratic divergence does not inuence the thermodynamics since it
is temperature independent. for this reason we do not see this contribution in the change
of the free energy.

where we chose to subtract a constant such that it vanishes at the horizon. the rst two
terms in (2.23) reproduce the potential obtained for planar horizon in [5,6] by substituting
teff with t 4. thus the eect of the curved background on the higgs potential is to
replace t by teff and add an additional term proportional to the curvature, i.e. the third
term in (2.23). the large temperature limit can be alternatively interpreted as the large
radius limit for the boundary 3-geometries. notice that teff  t as t tends to innity. for

as a function of the scalar mass m is shown in g. 1.

for k = 1, the conformal coupling to the curvature of the hyperboloid induces a
negative mass term for the n = 4 scalars. we have already seen in (2.11) that this tree
level coupling is reproduced in the d3-brane potential. therefore we would expect the
gauge theory to be unstable. an analysis of (2.23) shows however that the static potential
grows for small m reaching a maximum at

, where

this formula is valid also for teff < 1
is the eective temperature of empty
2
ads. the presence of a maximum means that in spite of the negative tree level mass the
gauge theory is still driven back to the symmetric phase due to thermal eects as long as
the scalar vacuum expectation value is not too large. of course these statements apply to
the limit of large n and large t hooft coupling , where the supergravity approximation
is valid. notice that the high of the potential maximum is proportional to n . for nite
n and coupling the theory could still be unstable e.g. due to tunneling of d3-branes
through the potential wall. it would also be interesting to see how much of this behavior is
reproduced at weak coupling. for this one would have to do a one-loop calculation of the

8

eective potential of n = 4 sym on the hyperbolic background in the higgs phase at nite
temperature. a precise comparison of the gauge theory result with the results obtained
here from supergravity seems problematic due to the well-known gauge dependence of the
eective potential. the values of the eective potential at extrema are however gauge
independent and can in principle be compared with the d3-brane potential at the maxima
(2.26).

for teff  0 the maximum of the potential tends to m = 0. at teff = 0 the potential
is monotonically decreasing with m . in fact the d3-brane potential at zero temperature
is precisely given by the tree level potential. this suggests that the eld theory at zero
temperature is unstable, a feature that, according to the ads/cft conjecture, should
be shared by the dual supergravity solution. in [27] a stability analysis of the extremal
case has been presented. the authors found however that this geometry is stable against
small perturbations. the resolution of this puzzle might go as follows. a d3-brane probe
on the extremal hyperbolic black hole will be driven away from the horizon unless it is
placed exactly at u+, the unstable maximum of the potential. since the length scale of the
supergravity solution is 4  n , it seems that the extremal geometry is unstable against
decreasing  and therefore increasing its curvature. therefore one should possibly not only
consider variations in the metric but also allow for changes of the four-form potential that
determines the ve-form ux on the s5.

3. wilson loops

we will analyze now the behavior of wilson loops and heavy quark potentials of
n = 4 yang-mills in s3 and h 3 using the ads/cft correspondence. at large n and
large t-hooft coupling, the expectation value of a wilson loop c is given in terms of the
dual string theory by [7,8]

hw (c)i  e(s(c)s0),

(3.1)

where s(c) is the nambu-goto action of the fundamental string whose world-sheet ends
on the contour c at the u   boundary and minimizes the action. we will consider
a contour describing the world-line of a q q pair of very heavy quarks. the action s(c)
is innite due to the contribution of the world-sheet region close to the boundary. this
divergence represents the self-energy of the non-dynamical quarks. in ads language a single
external quark is represented by a string extending straight along the radial coordinate
into the ads interior. it is therefore natural to regularize s(c) by subtracting the action
of two separated strings stretching down to u = 0 in the case of empty ads [7,8], or to the
horizon for black hole backgrounds [9,10]. we have denoted this term by s0 in (3.1).

we will restrict ourselves to the simplied case where q and q have equal charge under
the n = 4 r-symmetry group, su (4). this implies that the minimal area conguration

9

will lie at a single point in the s5 dimensions. we take q and q to be static and using
the symmetries of the sphere and hyperboloid we place them at (, , ) = (0, 0, 0) and
(, 0, 0) (for the sphere   (0, ) while for the hyperboloid   (0, )).

the energy of the q q conguration is given by the vacuum expectation value of the

wilson loop divided by . following [7] - [10] we nd5

(3.2)

we have dened z = 1/u0 with u0 being the minimal radial coordinate of the world-sheet
ending on c. the mass of the black hole is related to the eective temperature dened in
(2.21) by  = (teff )4  1/4. as in the previous section, expression (3.2) describes both
the cases of an s3 and h 3 boundary by taking respectively k = 1 or k = 1. the angular
distance between the quarks is given in terms of z by

(3.3)

the interaction potential between the pair of static quarks can be read directly from (3.2).
if e  0, vq q() = e. when e > 0 the conguration with two separated world-sheets
extending straight to the ads interior is energetically favored. then vq q = 0 corresponding
to screening of the charges [9,10].

3.1. quark-antiquark potentials on s3.

the most interesting aspect of n = 4 yang-mills on s3 is the existence of a phase
transition at t = tcrit [3]. in the supergravity dual its counterpart is the hawking-page
phase transition between black hole and pure ads solutions to the einsteins equations [14].
the study of quark-antiquark potentials should provide an additional piece of information
about the physics involved in it.

for temperatures below tcrit the supergravity dual to n = 4 yang-mills on s3 is
empty ads with the euclidean time coordinate  periodically identied with period  =
1/t . the low temperature phase corresponds to set  = 0, k = 1 in (3.2) and (3.3),

5 recently deformations of ads black holes with non-constant dilaton and the quark-antiquark

potential in these backgrounds has been studied in [28].

thogonal to the disk, the resulting expressions coincide formally with (3.4). since the nambu-goto

action depends on products of metric elements, dierent metrics can produce formally equivalent

expressions for the wilson loops.

is not dynamical connement but just a kinematical eect: gauss law on a compact space
does not allow for net charges. in agreement with that, g. 3 (a) shows that the strong
coupling quark-antiquark potential has a coulomb-like behavior. kinematical connement
is also present at weak coupling since the n = 4 gauge theory is in a coulomb phase at
zero temperature.

we will now compare the weak and strong coupling limits of the potential more quan-
titatively. in the weak coupling and zero temperature limit, the potential between a pair
of static charges on s3 can be calculated explicitly. at small coupling we can neglect
the non-linearity of yang-mills and just consider an abelian n = 4 gauge theory. the
potential between a pair of static charges with equal r-charge is due to the interchange of
gauge bosons and a linear combination of the six n = 4 scalars, i.e. that with r-charge
aligned with the quarks r-charge

the rst term is associated to gauge boson interchange.
it is obtained by solving the
laplace equation on s3 with opposite sign delta sources at the positions of the quarks,
and deriving from that the energy of the conguration. the second term in (3.6) is due
to the scalar interchange. it is obtained by solving the laplace equation with sources and
a mass term since the n = 4 scalars couple to the curvature of the 3-sphere. indeed we
have seen in the previous section that the scalars are conformally coupled, i.e. m2 = 1, as
expected [13].

the comparison between the weak and strong coupling limits of the potential at
t = 0 shows important renormalization eects. as in the at case [7], the dependence of
the potential on the t-hooft coupling changes from weak to strong coupling. on s3, in
addition, also its functional dependence on the inter-quark separation changes. the radius
of the sphere introduce a new scale and even in the conformally coupled case nothing
constrains the dependence of the potential on the angular separation of the quarks. this
does not contradict the fact that empty ads is an exact solution to the string equations
of motion [30] since (3.2) and (3.3) can receive  corrections due to quantum uctuations
of the string ending on the quarks world-line [31].
in order to compare the dierent 
dependence of (3.4) and (3.6), we have plotted in g. 3 (b) the quotient between the
strong and weak coupling potentials normalized such that it tends to 1 at   0, i.e.
e = e0vst/vw with

the potential at strong coupling is proportional to 1/2 instead of , which is the weak
coupling result. it is interesting to notice that this reduction in the expected intensity of

12

the potential at strong coupling decreases slightly as the angular separation of the quarks
grows.

at t  tcrit the eld theory undergoes a phase transition, detected because its
supergravity dual description changes from empty ads to an ads schwarzschild black
hole background. the black hole solutions have an entropy s  n 2. this implies that
there are  n 2 degrees of freedom contributing to the entropy of the dual gauge theory
and suggests that the gauge theory is in a deconned phase [3,13]. since low temperature
connement is just the statement of gauss law on the sphere, we could think that what
triggers the phase transition is screening. let us analyze the situation at weak coupling.
the q q potential at weak coupling is proportional to exp(mell)
. to lowest order we can
estimate the electric screening mass to be m2
is
much smaller than the size of the compact manifold the gauge theory will qualitatively
behave as in at space. charges will be screened and we expect the entropy to scale like
n 2. if however the screening length is bigger or of the order of the compact space size, the
quark charges are not screened over maximal distances on the compact space. in this case
physical states have to be color neutral and no quasi-free charges are possible. thus we
expect the entropy to scale like n 0. therefore even at weak coupling there will be a phase
transition in the large n gauge theory at nite temperature on a compact space. if there
is not other dominant mechanism, screening phenomena will induce a phase transition at
tc  1
for the case of a three sphere of unit radius where the maximal distance is

. although at weak coupling this crude estimate gives a very high critical temperature,
strong coupling eects could importantly lower it.

we derive again vq q from (3.2) and (3.3). the high temperature phase of n = 4 on
s3 corresponds to   2. the results parallel those obtained in the at case [9] [10]. the

13

single string conguration with boundary on the quarks positions exists only for inter-
quark distances smaller than a certain threshold, lm(t ). for each distance l < lm(t )
there are two string congurations that extremize the nambu-goto action. one of them
has bigger action than that of two separated strings extending straight to the black hole
horizon and is therefore energetically disfavored. for separations ls(t ) < l  lm(t ), the
action of the second single string conguration is also bigger than that of two separated
strings (see g. 4). therefore vq q = 0 for quark separations bigger than ls(t ): the high
temperature phase exhibits total screening.

we observe in g. 5 that the screening length is always much smaller than . ads
schwarzschild black hole solutions exist for t  tmin though they are only stable for
temperatures bigger than tcrit > tmin. black hole solutions with tcrit > t  tmin
could correspond to meta-stable states in the dual gauge theory. for completeness, we
have also plotted in g. 5 the potential induced by the black hole solution at tmin. the
screening length is still very small. since the supergravity solutions we are treating have
constant dilaton, the results obtained for the screening length between electric charges
apply also to magnetic and dyonic charges. according to this result the phase transition is
not triggered by screening of the electric or magnetic charges. if the degrees of freedom at
strong coupling were electrically charged their charges would still be completely screened
even at (and below) the critical temperature. our results seem therefore to indicate that
the relevant n 2 degrees of freedom at the phase transition do not carry electric charges.
the other possible interpretation is that kinematical connement of the charges is not the
mechanism which triggers the phase transition.

3.2. quark-antiquark potentials on h 3.

we turn now to analyze quark-antiquark potentials of n = 4 yang-mills on the 3-
hyperboloid. in the large n and large t-hooft coupling limit the inter-quark potential
is derived from (3.2) and (3.3) by setting k = 1 and   1/4; the results are plotted
in g. 6. as in the at case, for temperatures bigger than zero there is a maximal quark
separation after which the charges are completely screened. the surprising result is that
even at t = 0 the potential has a nite range!

for t > 0 the dependence of vq q and the inter-quark separation on the minimal radial
distance of the single string conguration is as shown in g. 4. in particular this is true for
t = 1/2, when the background geometry is just empty ads with a hyperbolic boundary.
the situation at t = 0 is however dierent. the action of the single string conguration
is always smaller than that of two separated strings. for each inter-quark separation there
is only one single string conguration. as the tip of the string gets closer to the black hole
horizon, the inter-quark separation tends to the value

this relation is obtained by changing variables y21 = (1 z2
2 ) x in (3.3) with z < 1 and
 = 0, and then taking the limit z  1 8. for separations bigger than ls the only possible
conguration is that of two separated strings, i.e. the charges are screened. of course since

8 as for the low temperature phase on s 3, (3.2) and (3.3) with k = 1 and  = 1/4 can be
integrated in terms of elliptic functions. the results coincide formally with those of [11] when the

q q pair lies in the plane of the disk (see footnote 6).

we are on a hyperbolic space, the coulomb potential will also show exponential fallo at
zero temperature in the weak coupling limit, v  coth . the result at strong coupling
deviates however from this weak coupling behavior since we nd a maximum interaction
distance. this indicates an additional screening of the charges at strong coupling9. the
black hole background at t = 0 has zero energy but non-zero entropy s  n 2 [17] [18].
the presence of these n 2 states contributing to the entropy but not to the energy could
be related with the presence of total screening.

9 screening at t = 0 has been also encountered in [11]. the geometry describing that case
coincides with the extremal limit of a rotating d3-brane solution [32] [33]. it is interesting to

notice that the hyperbolic black hole geometry at t = 0 is also extremal.
