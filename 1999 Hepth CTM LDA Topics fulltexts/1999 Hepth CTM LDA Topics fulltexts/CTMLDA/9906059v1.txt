abstract :

in string theory, an important role is played by certain lie groups

which are locally isomorphic to so(4m), m  8. it has long been known that these
groups are actually isomorphic not to so(4m) but rather to the groups for which the half

- spin representations are faithful, which we propose to call semispin(4m).(they are
known in the physics literature by the ambiguous name of spin(4m)/z2.) recent work

on string duality has shown that the distinction between so(4m) and semispin(4m)
can have a denite physical signicance. this work is a survey of the relevant properties
of semispin(4m) and its subgroups.

i. introduction.

from a physical point of view, gauge theories have a serious drawback : the con-

struction works equally well for all compact lie groups. even when the lie algebra of
the gauge group is known, the global structure of the group itself is not xed by any fun-

damental principle. for example, it can be argued that the gauge group of the standard
model [1] is really [su (3)  su (2)  u (1)]/z6 rather than su (3)  su (2)  u (1); but

since all known particles fall into multiplets which can be regarded as representations
of both of these groups, there is ( at present ) no way of deciding the issue other than
by an appeal to parsimony.

it is one of the many virtues of string theory that it puts an end to all uncertainty
on this score [2]. the theory not only species the dimension of the gauge group (at 496

in the type i and heterotic theories) but also its global structure within each version.
in the heterotic e8  e8 theory, this is quite straightforward. first, there is in any

case only one connected group with the lie algebra of e8  e8, namely e8  e8 itself.
second, there is only one non-trivial disconnected lie group with e8  e8 as identity

component, namely the semi-direct product (e8 e8) z2, where z2 acts by exchanging
the e8 factors. as the corresponding string theory ( initially ) treats the two factors
symmetrically, we conclude that the global version of the gauge group is (e8  e8)  z2.

( the signicance of disconnected gauge groups is discussed in refs.
[3],[4],[5],[6]. by
non-trivial we mean to exclude, for example, direct products of nite groups with

e8  e8, which are of little or no physical interest.)

the so(32) cases ( type i and heterotic ) are much less straightforward, because

there are many non-trivial groups with the same lie algebra as so(n); in fact, there
are eight non-trivial groups with the so(32) algebra. it has been known from the

beginning [7] that string theory selects from these eight a group known in the physics
literature as spin(32)/z2 - a most unfortunate convention, which only exacerbates the
tendency to confuse this group with so(32). this group is closely associated with ( and

is essentially dened by ) the half-spin representations of spin(32), and so we propose
the name semispin(32) for it. as we shall see, there is no non-trivial disconnected lie

group with semispin(32) as identity component, so the gauge group is connected in
this case.

to summarise : the heterotic string theories x the global structures of their gauge
groups. one theory uses the disconnected but simply connected group (e8  e8)  z2,

5

while the other uses the connected but not simply connected group semispin(32).

the semispin groups are perhaps the least familiar of the compact simple lie groups,

and there is a venerable tradition of treating semispin(4m) as if it were the same as
so(4m). we wish to argue that this tradition has outlived its usefulness, that string

theory forces us to be fully aware of the dierences between semispin(4m) and the other
groups with the same algebra. there are two physically signicant kinds of distinction,
one representation - theoretic, the other topological.

first, note that while such ambiguities have often arisen in the past, one of the
groups in question has always been a cover of the other. for example, so(10) grand

unication [8] uses a certain 16 - dimensional multiplet which does not correspond to
any representation of so(10). it is, of course, a representation of spin(10). one can

solve this problem by simply reading spin(10) for so(10); no harm is done, but only
because every representation of so(10) is automatically a representation of spin(10),

the latter being a cover of the former. in the opposite direction, one normally writes
su (3)  su (2)  u (1) for (su (3)  su (2)  u (1)/z6, the true group [1], with no ill
eects because every representation of the latter is a representation of the former. the

novelty in string theory is that neither so(32) nor semispin(32) is a cover of the other.
consequently, both have representations which cannot be regarded as representations of

the other. the situation here is quite dierent to the supercially analogous ambiguities
arising in earlier gauge theories.

secondly, there exist semispin(32) gauge congurations (over topologically non -
trivial space - times ) which are of considerable physical importance, but which cannot

be interpreted as so(32) gauge congurations [9],[10]. the reader might argue that
one can likewise construct so(10) congurations which do not lift to spin(10). the

point, however, is just that ordinary gauge theory does not provide any fundamental
justication for thinking so(10) important. string theory, by contrast, does favour
semispin(32) over so(32). the analysis of semispin(32) bundles which cannot be

regarded as spin(32) or so(32) bundles is therefore physically signicant.

finally, the study of duality [11] brings both points together in a potentially very

confusing way. the t-duality between the two heterotic theories relies on relating
e8e8 and so(32) through their supposed common subgroup, so(16)so(16).

a global investigation shows that no such common subgroup exists; worse still, neither
of the actual respective subgroups covers the other ; worse yet again, each has represen-

tations which are not representations of the other, but which are crucial in establishing
duality. solving this problem leads to further topological obstructions, and, in the back-

6

ground, one has wilson loops behaving in a way that depends very delicately on the
global structure of various subgroups of semispin(32) and semispin(16). in short, the

local simplicity of the duality argument conceals considerable complexity at the global
level.

the purpose of this work is not to solve all of these problems, but rather to give a

useful survey of those aspects of the semispin groups ( and their subgroups ) which are
most directly relevant to string theory. the main emphasis is on the structure of the
groups themselves rather than their representations, since the latter are well understood

and since it is the former which is needed for dealing with topological obstructions and
for analysing the eect of wilson loops.

we begin with a brief survey of the family of non - trivial lie groups with the

algebra of so(n).

ii. groups with the algebra of so(n).

in order to understand the ways in which semispin(4m) diers from the other
groups with the same lie algebra, it is useful to begin with a complete classication.

we refer the reader to ref.[12] for the basic techniques, or to ref.[13] for a much simpler
account.

we shall not assume that the gauge group is connected : we have already seen that

this would not be justiable in one heterotic theory. on the other hand, it is true that
most disconnected lie groups are of little physical interest. every compact lie group

can be expressed as a nite union of connected components,

g = g0 [ 1  g0 [ 2  g0 [ . . .

where g0 contains the identity and the i are not elements of g0. the non-identity
components of a gauge group are particularly important if space-time is not simply
connected, since in that case parallel transport of particles around non-contractible
paths ( wilson loops ) can aect conserved charges [3],[4],[5]. however, a given
component, i  g0, can only give rise to such eects if i cannot be chosen so as to
commute with every element of g0. the physically interesting disconnected groups are
those such that none of the i can be chosen to commute with every element of g0.
such a group is called a natural extension of its identity component. for example,

(e8  e8)  z2 is a natural extension of e8  e8, and it is in fact the only other natural
extension. ( it is convenient to adopt the convention that a connected group is a natural

7

extension of itself. ) henceforth, we conne attention to disconnected groups which are
natural extensions of their identity components.

next, some denitions. let p in(n), n  2, be dened as usual [14] in terms of
a cliord algebra with a basis {ei}. we can write p in(n) as a natural extension of
spin(n), when n is even :

p in(2m) = spin(2m)[ e1  spin(2m).

notice that this is not necessarily a semi-direct product, since (e1)2 = 1  spin(2m).
however, spin (2m)  z2 can be dened (with the generator of z2 acting in the same

way as conjugation by e1); it is actually isomorphic to p in(2m) if m is even, but not if
m is odd. it, too, is a natural extension of spin(2m). ( there is no natural extension

of spin(n), other than itself, when n is odd. )

let km,n be dened by

km,n =

n

i=m

ei

and set km = k1,m. then the centre of spin(n) is {1} if n is odd, while the centre
of spin(2m) is {1,  k2m}. since ( k2m)2 = (1)m, the centre is z4 if m is odd, but
z2  z2 if m is even [15]. here we think of {1, k2m} as the rst z2, {1,  k2m} as the
second, and {1} as the diagonal. of course, we have

spin(n)/{1} = so(n) for all n  2.

when n is odd, so(n) has no natural extension other than itself, but when n is even it

has two others. the rst is o(2m), which may be expressed as

o(2m) = so(2m)[ a2m  so(2m),

where a2m is a (2m)  (2m) orthogonal matrix satisfying a2
thinking of o(2m) as the real subgroup of u (2m), we can also dene

2m = i2m, deta2m = 1.

oi(2m) = so(2m)[ ia2m  so(2m);

this group is also a natural extension of so(2m), and it is not isomorphic to o(2m).

when n is even, so(n) has a non-trivial quotient,

p so(2m) = so(2m)/{i2m},

8

the projective special orthogonal group. we can dene p o(2m) as the same quotient
of o(2m), and it is a natural extension of p so(2m). notice that p so(2m) can be

obtained directly from spin(2m) by factoring out the entire centre.

when n is a multiple of 4, we can also consider the quotients spin(4m)/{1, k4m}
and spin(4m)/{1,  k4m}. let ad(e1) denote conjugation by e1 in p in(4m); then
ad(e1) is an automorphism of spin(4m), and

ad(e1) k4m =  k4m.

it follows that spin(4m)/{1, k4m} and spin(4m)/{1,  k4m} are mutually isomorphic.
thus we obtain only one group in this way, not two. we dene

semispin(4m) = spin(4m)/{1, k4m}.

this group is isomorphic to so(4m) only if spin(4m) admits an automorphism which
maps k4m to 1 ; but no such automorphism exists, except when m = 2. leaving that
case to one side, ad(e1) is, up to inner automorphisms, the only outer automorphism
of spin(4m). since ad(e1) does not map {1, k4m} into itself, we see that, unlike
spin(4m), so(4m), and p so(4m), semispin(4m) has no outer automorphism if m 6=
2.
if, therefore, g is a compact disconnected group with semispin(4m) as identity
component,

g = semispin(4m)[ 1  semispin(4m)[ . . . ,

then ad(i) must, for all i, be inner : ad(i) = ad(si) for some si in semispin(4m).
thus i s1
commutes with every element of semispin(4m), and so we see that, when
m 6= 2, semispin(4m) has no natural extension other than itself.

i

when m = 2, we have spin(8), which has the triality map [14], an automorphism

of order three. this combines with ad(e1) to give d6, the dihedral group of order six.
triality maps k8 to 1, so in fact

semispin(8) = so(8).

this is the only dimension in which the semispin construction gives nothing new.
triality does not descend to so(8) (because it does not preserve {1}) but it does
descend to p so(8).

we are now in a position to state the following theorem, the proof of which is an

application of techniques given in refs. [12] and [13].

9

theorem 1 : let g be a compact lie group which is a natural extension of its identity
component. if the lie algebra of g is isomorphic to that of so(n), n  2, then g is

globally isomorphic to a group in the following list:

(1) n = 2 : so(2), o(2), p in(2).

(2) n = odd : so(n), spin(n).

(3) n = 4m + 2, m  1 : spin(n), p in(n), spin(n)  z2, so(n), o(n), oi(n),

p so(n), p o(n).

(4) n = 4m, m 6= 2 : spin(n), p in(n), so(n), o(n), oi(n), p so(n), p o(n),
semispin(n).

(5) n = 8 : spin(8), p in(8), spin(8)  z3, spin(8)  d6, so(8), o(8), oi(8),

p so(8), p o(8), p so(8)  z3, p so(8)  d6.

note that spin(4) = su (2)  su (2), p so(4) = so(3)  so(3), and semispin(4) =

su (2)  so(3).

these, then, are the non-trivial distinct groups corresponding to the so(n) algebra.
when n is 32, there are no fewer than eight candidates. string theory selects a particular

group from among these eight in the following extraordinary way.
in the heterotic
theories, gauge elds arise in connection with the lattice of momenta on a sixteen-

dimensional torus. the lattice must be even and self - dual. the crucial point is that
these requirements impose conditions not merely on the root system of the gauge group,
but also on its integral lattice [16]. however, there is a deep connection between the

integral lattice and the global structure of a compact, connected lie group. thus string
theory provides a route from strictly physical conditions directly to the global structure

of the ( identity component of the ) gauge group. as is well known, semispin(32)
satises these conditions, while so(32), spin(32), and p so(32) do not. the argument

is now completed by a glance at theorem 1 : we see that spin(32) and p so(32)
each have a non-trivial disconnected version, and so(32) has two, but semispin(32)
it is
has none. the precise global structure of the gauge group is thereby xed :

semispin(32).

we close this section with some remarks on the representation theory of spin(4m),

semispin(4m), so(4m), and p so(4m). recall that the basic faithful representation
of spin(4m), obtained [14] by suitably restricting an irreducible representation of the
cliord algebra, has a canonical decomposition

4m =  +

4m   

4m,

10

4m nor  

4m is a representation with kernel {1, k4m} and  

4m has kernel {1,  k4m}.
where  +
4m is faithful ; one must take their sum. hence  +
thus, neither  +
4m
and  
4m are called the half-spin representations. evidently they are faithful not on
spin(4m) but on the group we (accordingly) call semispin(4m). the half-spin repre-
sentations are of dimension 22m1. thus the so-called  128-dimensional representation
of so(16) which plays a prominent role in string theory is in fact the dening represen-
tation of semispin(16). again, the dening representation of semispin(32) is 32, 768

- dimensional, a decidedly inconvenient value. fortunately, we have

p so(32) = semispin(32)/z2,

and so every representation of p so(32) is automatically a representation of semispin(32);
thus, the latter has a more manageable (but unfaithful) 496 - dimensional representa-

tion, which is also an unfaithful representation of so(32) and spin(32), namely the
adjoint. similarly p so(16) yields a 120 - dimensional representation of semispin(16),
and so the latter has a faithful 248 - dimensional representation dened by the direct

sum, 120  128. as the representation is faithful, and as the (likewise faithful) ad-
joint of e8 decomposes as 248 = 120  128, this immediately shows that e8 contains

semispin(16) and not, as is so often said, so(16). thus (e8  e8)  z2 has a max-
imal subgroup of the form (semispin(16)  semispin(16))  z2, and so we see that

the semispin groups appear in both heterotic string theories. in fact, witten [17] has
recently argued that the same is true of the type i theory. the gauge group of type
i at the perturbative level is p o(32) ( see theorem 1). as this group is disconnected,

while semispin(32) has no non-trivial disconnected version, this appears to obstruct
the supposed s-duality between the type i and the so(32) heterotic string theories

[11]. however, witten shows that a subtle non-perturbative eect breaks p o(32) to
p so(32) = semispin(32)/z2; furthermore, there appear to be type i non-perturbative

states transforming spinorially under the gauge group. ( note that, like a spinor,
a semispinor is odd under a 2 rotation; the non-trivial element in the centre of

semispin(32) is the projection of 1 in spin(32). ) in short, the gauge group of type
i string theory is undoubtedly semispin(32) precisely, not so(32). the semispin
groups appear in all three string theories with non-trivial gauge groups.

all this appears to bode well for duality : in particular, since (e8  e8)  z2 con-
tains (semispin(16)  semispin(16))  z2, one would expect this same group to appear

on the semispin(32) side. in fact, this is not the case, as we now show.

iii. subgroups of semispin(4m) corresponding to

11

so(k)  so(4m  k)

evidently so(32) contains so(16)  so(16) block - diagonally; more generally,
so(4m) contains so(k)  so(4m  k), k  2. the product is indeed direct, since
so(k) and so(4mk) intersect trivially, in {i4m}. however, spin(4m) does not contain
spin(k)  spin(4m  k), because both factors contain {1}. in fact, the subgroup is

spin(k)  spin(4m  k), a local direct product, where

spin(k)  spin(4m  k) = (spin(k)  spin(4m  k))/z2,

with z2 generated by (1, 1).

there is another important dierence between so(4m) and spin(4m) in this area.
it is clear that, when k = 2j is even, spin(k)  spin(4m  k) can be characterised as

the group of all spin(4m) elements which commute with ( that is, as the centraliser
of ) k2j. now k2j projects to the so(4m) matrix diag (i2j, i4m2j) = k2j, but the
so(4m) centraliser of k2j is not so(2j)  so(4m  2j); rather, it is the disconnected
subgroup s(o(2j)  o(4m  2j)), the set of all pairs (a, b) in o(2j)  o(4m  2j)

such that det a = det b. that is, a wilson loop that breaks spin(4m) to a connected
subgroup will break so(4m) to a disconnected subgroup. ( recall [2] that a wilson
loop in a gauge theory is a closed curve in space-time which has a non-trivial holonomy

element even in the vacuum. the gauge group is broken to the centraliser of the (usually
nite) subgroup generated by the holonomy element. )

now we turn to the case of the semispin(4m). suppose rst that k is odd. then
spin(k)  spin(4m  k) does not contain k4m, and so it is unaected by the projection
from spin(4m) to semispin(4m). thus, when k is odd, the subgroup of semispin(4m)

corresponding to so(k)  so(4m  k) is globally isomorphic to spin(k)  spin(4m  k).
next, suppose that k = 2j is even but not a multiple of 4. then 4m  2j is likewise even

but not a multiple of 4, and so spin(2j) and spin(4m  2j) have z4 centres generated
respectively by k2j and k2j+1,4m. we have

and

k2j k4m =  k2j+1,4m

k2j+1,4m k4m =  k2j,

and so the eect of factoring by k4m is to identify the entire centre of spin(4m  2j)
with that of spin(2j). we have, when j is odd,

spin(2j)

spin(4m  2j) = (spin(2j)  spin(4m  2j))/z4

12

as the subgroup of semispin(4m) corresponding to so(2j)  so(4m  2j).

finally, if k = 4j is a multiple of 4, then so is 4m  4j and both spin(4j) and
spin(4m  4j) have centres isomorphic to z2  z2. these centres are {1,  k4j} and
{1, k4j+1,4m} respectively, and since we have

and

 k4j k4m =  k4j+1,4m

 k4j+1,4m k4m =  k4j,

we see that, once again, the eect of the projection spin(4m)  semispin(4m) is to

identify the entire centre of spin(4m  4j) with that of spin(4j). we use the notation

spin(4j)

spin(4m  4j) = (spin(4j)  spin(4m  4j))/(z2  z2).

next, recall that, from a physical point of view, we are interested in obtaining all

2j be the projection of k2j to semispin(4m). the centraliser of k 

these groups as centralisers of some element in semispin(4m). we saw earlier that
the centraliser of k2j in spin(4m) is connected, but that of k2j in so(4m) is not.
let k 
2j will include
spin(2j)
spin(4m2j), but it wil also include any semispin(4m) element l such that
l, a lift of l to spin(4m), satises l k2j = k4m k2j l. projecting this to so(4m),
we nd that the corresponding matrices satisfy

l k2j l1 = k2j,

whence trace k2j = 4(m  j) = 0. thus if j 6= m, l does not exist, and so the
centraliser of k 
spin(4m  2j). if j = m,
then we have

2j in semispin(4m) is precisely spin(2j)

j2m k2m j 1

2m = k2m,

where

j2m = (cid:18) 0 i2m

0 (cid:19) .

i2m

this solution is essentially unique. the corresponding element of spin(4m) is (see ref.
[16], page 174, and modify suitably )

j2m = 2m(1  e1 e1+2m)(1  e2 e2+2m) . . . (1  e2m e4m).

now

k2m j2m = 2m(e1 + e1+2m)(e2 + e2+2m) . . . (e2m + e4m)

13

= 2m(e1+2m + e1)(e2+2m + e2) . . . (e4m + e2m)

= j2m k1+2m,4m = (1)m k4m j2m k2m

since ( k2m)2 = (1)m and k2m k1+2m,4m = k4m. thus if m is even, the projections to
semispin(4m) satisfy k 
2m as required. if m is odd, we project instead
to spin(4m)/{1,  k4m} and recall that this is isomorphic to semispin(4m). a further
exercise in cliord algebra shows that

2m = j 

2mk 

2mj 

( j2m)2 = (1)m k4m,

and so the appropriate projections are of order two. the eect on spin(2m)

spin(2m)
2m is to exchange the two factors. we conclude that the centraliser

of conjugation by j 
of k 

2j in semispin(4m) is

spin(2j)

spin(4m  2j) if j 6= m

(spin(2m)

spin(2m))  z2 if j = m.

finally, let us consider the specic case of semispin(32). its so(16)  so(16)
spin(16))  z2 where the full centre of each spin(16)

subgroup is actually (spin(16)

is identied with that of the other, and where z2 exchanges the two factors. compare
this with the so(16)  so(16) subgroup of (e8  e8)  z2, which is (semispin(16) 
semispin(16))  z2. both groups have the exchange z2, which is welcome from the

point of view of t -duality. but spin(16)
spin(16) is not isomorphic to semispin(16)
semispin(16). both are z2  z2 quotients of spin(16)  spin(16), but z2  z2

acts dierently in each case. this implies that neither is a cover of the other, and
so they each have representations which cannot be regarded as representations of the

other. for example, by factoring out {1} in spin(16)
spin(16), we obtain so(16) 
so(16), where the dot means that the two factors have a non-trivial intersection,

{ i16}. the tensor product of the vector with itself, (16, 16), is faithful for this
group, and so it is a representation of spin(16)
spin(16). this representation con-
tains faithful copies of so(16), something which is impossible for any representation

of semispin(16)  semispin(16). on the other hand, let (128, 1)  (1, 128) be the
dening representation of semispin(16)  semispin(16); this representation distin-

guishes the centres of the two semispin(16) factors, which cannot happen in any rep-
spin(16) by
resentation of spin(16)
{1, k16}, then we obtain semispin(16)  semispin(16), in which the two factors in-
tersect in {1}, where we use 1 to denote the projection of 1 in spin(16); but

spin(16). ( if we take the quotient of spin(16)

14

(128, 1)(1, 128) does not descend to a representation of this group. ) the two groups
do have some representations in common, such as (128, 128) and (120, 1)  (1, 120),

the latter being the dening representation for p so(16)  p so(16), which is a z2  z2
quotient of both semispin(16)semispin(16) and spin(16)
spin(16). however, while
(120, 1)  (1, 120) is important for duality, so also are (16, 16) and (128, 1)  (1, 128).

we see, then, that the appearance of semispin groups in both heterotic theories
was somewhat deceptive; for semispin(4m) is strangely unlike spin(4m) and so(4m).

while these last contain subgroups of the same kind as themselves, spin(2j)
2j) and so(2j)so(4m2j) respectively, semispin(4m) does not contain semispin(2j)

spin(4m

 semispin(4m  2j). instead, it contains spin(2j)
spin(4m  2j). thus we arrive
at the disconcerting fact that while e8  e8 contains semispin groups, semispin(32)

itself does not. the common so(16)so(16) subgroup  which appears in the duality
literature not only fails to be isomorphic to so(16)  so(16): it simply does not exist.

one way to approach this problem is to nd a group which covers both semispin(16)

semispin(16) and spin(16)
spin(16), since all of the representations of both groups will
then be representations of that group. one obvious choice is spin(16)  spin(16), but

there is a better alternative, constructed as follows. write spin(16)  spin(16) as
spin(16)l  spin(16)r and let {1l,  k l
16} be the respective centres.
we dene

16}, {1r,  k r

spin(16)  spin(16) = (spin(16)  spin(16))/{(1l, 1r), ( k l

16, k r

16)}.

that is, we identify k r

16 with k l

16. further factoring by this element produces

semispin(16)semispin(16), while factoring by (1l, 1r) produces spin(16)
that is, spin(16)  spin(16) is a double cover of both semispin(16) semispin(16) and
spin(16)
spin(16). hence (16, 16), (128, 1)  (1, 128), and (120, 1)  (1, 120) are all
(unfaithful) representations of spin(16)  spin(16), and (16, 16)  (128, 1)  (1, 128)

spin(16).

is a faithful representation of spin(16)  spin(16), though it is not a representation of
spin(16), much less so(16)  so(16). (it
semispin(16)  semispin(16) or spin(16)
is faithful because k16, the one non-trivial element of spin(16)  spin(16) mapped to
the identity by (128, 1)  (1, 128), acts as 1 in (16, 16).)

in fact, spin(16)spin(16) is the gauge group of the unique tachyon-free 10 dimen-
sional non-supersymmetric heterotic string theory [18],[19], which plays a central role in

recent investigations of strong-coupling duality [20]. the massless spectrum of this the-
ory consists of a gravity multiplet, spacetime vectors assigned to (120, 1)(1, 120), and

15

spacetime spinors assigned to the so(16)so(16) representation (16, 16)(128, 1)
(1, 128), which, as we have seen, is a faithful representation of spin(16)  spin(16).

we claim, then, that the string theorists so(16)  so(16) is actually spin(16) 

spin(16). the strange feature of this conclusion is that spin(16)spin(16) is not a sub-
group of either e8 e8 or semispin(32). (nor can it be embedded in spin(32), so(32),

or p so(32)). thus it does not make sense to speak of breaking e8e8 or semispin(32)
to spin(16)  spin(16) by a wilson loop or in any other way. we believe that the way
to solve this problem is through a study of generalised stiefel-whitney classes [9],[10].

for example, to establish the duality of a certain semispin(32) conguration with an
spin(16))  z2, lifts
(e8 e8)  z2 conguration, one breaks semispin(32) to (spin(16)

this to a (spin(16)spin(16)) z2 structure ( checking that the appropriate generalised
stiefel-whitney class vanishes ), projects this to a (semispin(16)  semispin(16))  z2

structure, and then extends to (e8 e8) z2 the details of this process will be described
elsewhere.

let us summarise as follows. so(4m), m > 2, has important subgroups of the

form so(k)  so(4m  k), though in fact this is just the identity component of
s(o(k)  o(4m  k)). the other three connected groups locally isomorphic to so(4m),

namely spin(4m), semispin(4m),and p so(4m), have analogous subgroups given by
the following theorem.

theorem 2: the lie algebra inclusion so(k)  so(4m  k)  so(4m) has the

following counterparts at the lie group level.

s(o(k)  o(4m  k))  so(4m)
spin(k)  spin(4m  k)  spin(4m)

p s(o(k)  o(4m  k))  p so(4m)
spin(k)  spin(4m  k)  semispin(4m) (k odd)

spin(2j)
(spin(2m)

spin(4m  2j)  semispin(4m) (k = 2j, j 6= m)

spin(2m))  z2  semispin(4m)

here a single dot denotes a factoring by a diagonal z2, as also does the prex p , while
the double dot denotes a factoring by a diagonal z4 or by z2  z2 as the case may be.

iv subgroups of semispin (4m) corresponding to u(2m).

another subgroup of so(4m) which plays an important role in the string liter-

ature ( see, for example, refs [9],[20],[21] ) is the unitary group u (2m).

if a + i b

is any element of u (2m), where a and b are real, then (cid:18) a b

a(cid:19) is an element of

b

so(4m). the unitary subgroup can also be characterised as the centraliser of the ma-
trix j2m dened in the preceding section. ( notice that j2m is so(4m)-conjugate to

diag (cid:18)(cid:18) 0 1

0(cid:19) ,(cid:18) 0 1

0(cid:19) . . .(cid:19), and the reader can take j2m to be dened in this

1

1

way if that is convenient. )

now u (2m) is not isomorphic to u (1)  su (2m), because u (1) and su (2m) in-
tersect non-trivially. let z be a primitive (2m)-th root of unity, and let z2m act on
u (1)  su (2m) by

(u, s)  (uz1, zs).

then (u (1)  su (2m))/z2m is isomorphic to u (2m). elements of u (2m) may therefore
be represented as equivalence classes, [u, s]2m.

now we ask : what is the subgroup of spin(4m) which projects onto u (2m)? it is
useful to notice that the answer cannot be isomorphic to u (2m), for u (2m) would be

of maximal rank in spin(4m), and so the centre of spin(4m) would be contained in the
centre of u (2m); that is, we would have z2  z2 contained in u (1), which is impossible.

( this argument would not work for the u (2m + 1) subgroup of so(4m + 2), and indeed
the cover of u (2m + 1) in spin(4m + 2) is again isomorphic to u (2m + 1).) in fact, it
is not dicult to see that spin(4m) contains (u (1)  su (2m))/zm, which consists of
pairs [u, s]m. in this group, [z1, z i2m]m is not the identity, though [z1, z i2m]2m = 1;
therefore [z1, z i2m]m corresponds to 1 in spin(4m). there is another important
element of order two in this group, [1, i2m]m, but of course there are others, such as
[z1, z i2m]m. in order to determine the structure of the subgroup of semispin(4m)
corresponding to u (2m), we must determine which of these corresponds to k4m.

theorem 3 : let semiu (2m) denote the projection of (u (1)  su (2m)/zm to
semispin(4m). then the global structure of semiu (2m) is given as follows :

semiu (2m) = [u (1)  (su (2m)/z2)]/zm/2, m even

= [u (1)  su (2m)]/zm, m odd.

proof: under the embedding of u (2m) in so(4m), the matrix j2m arises from the
u (2m) matrix i i2m, which is [i , i2m]2m. thus we see that the spin(4m) element j2m

17

dened in the preceding section must be either [i , i2m]m or [i z1, z i2m]m. in either
case we have ( j2m)2 = [1, i2m]m. now recall that ( j2m)2 = (1)m k4m and that we
have agreed to dene semispin(4m) by spin(4m)/{1, (1)m k4m} for convenience, so
2m is always of order two. ( see the remarks at the end of this section. ) thus
that j 
when m is odd, we must factor by

 k4m = [1, i2m]m 6= [1, i2m]m.

clearly, the factoring will aect u (1) but not su (2m). however, u (1)/z2 = u (1), since
the map u  u2 is a group epimorphism for this innite abelian group. thus we obtain
[u (1)  su (2m)]/zm when m is odd. when m is even, k4m is [1, i2m]m, which is
equal to [1, i2m]m. the factoring will aect both u (1) and su (2m) in this case, and,
after it, the z2 in zm will act trivially; so we obtain (u (1)/z2)  (su (2m)/z2), with
an eective action by zm/2. hence the group is [(u (1)  (su (2m)/z2)]/zm/2, and this
completes the proof.

notice that, according to this theorem,

semiu (2) = [u (1)  su (2)]/z1 = so(2)  su (2),

which is indeed a subgroup of semispin(4) = so(3)  su (2). again,

semiu (4) = [u (1)  (su (4)/z2)]/z1 = so(2)  so(6),

which is contained in so(8) = semispin(8).

clearly semiu (2m) is the identity component of the centraliser, in semispin(4m),
2m, the projection of j2m. recall that, unlike j2m in so(4m) and j2m in spin(4m)
of j 
(which are both of order 4), j 
2m is of order 2; this is important for applications [9],[21].
for example, consider a semispin(32) heterotic theory compactied on a k3 surface

which is a kummer surface at an orbifold limit, with a point - like instanton at the
singular point [21]. excising this point, we obtain a neighbourhood which retracts to
the projective sphere, s 3/z2. if j 
16 were of order four, then it could not be realised as
a holonomy element over s 3/z2, and so the gauge group would not break. but j 
16 is
of order two, and so it can be realised as a holonomy over s 3/z2. (in the literature
it is always assumed that a nite group f can always be realised as a holonomy
group over manifolds of the form m/f . this is true - with very mild conditions - but

not at all obvious [6].) then (unless one arranges to avoid it [21]) semispin(32) will
break to the centraliser of j 
16 in semispin(32). this includes semiu (16), but it also

18

includes k 

16, as we saw in the preceding section. the matrix k16 = diag(i16, i16)

acts by complex conjugation on u(16), that is, k16(cid:18) a b

a(cid:19) k 1

b

16 = (cid:18) a b

b a(cid:19).

16 maps elements of semiu (16) to their complex conjugates.
similarly, conjugation by k 
( a typical element of semiu (16) = [u (1)  (su (16)/z2)]/z4 has the form [u2, [s]2]4,
with complex conjugate [(u2, [s]2]4; bear in mind that z4 acts on u (1)  (su (16)/z2)
by (u2, [s]2)  (i u2, [zs]2), with z8 = 1.) as (k 
16 breaks
semispin(32) to semiu (16)  z2 and not [9],[21] to u(16) or u (16)/z2, which are quite
dierent to semiu (16). notice the dierences with so(32) : j16 is of order four, and
its centraliser in so(32) is the connected group u (16), while j 
16 is of order two, with
semispin(32) centraliser isomorphic to the disconnected group semiu (16)  z2. on the
other hand, j16 cannot break so(32) over s 3/z2, but j 
( note also that there do exist bundles over s 3/z2 having the full disconnected group
semiu (16)  z2 as holonomy group [6].)

16)2 = 1, we see that j 

16 can break semispin(32).

in the same way, j 

with z2 generated by k 
semispin(16) is mainly of interest because it is a maximal subgroup of e8.

8 is of order two, and it breaks semispin(16) to semiu (8)  z2,
8 , and with semiu (8) = [u (1)  (su (8)/z2)]/z2. however,
if j 
8
is embedded in e8 through semispin(16), then of course its centraliser must contain
semiu (8)  z2; however, this cannot be the full centraliser, since the centraliser of any

element of a simply connected compact lie group (such as e8, but not semispin(16))
8 must be a connected subgroup of e8
must be connected. hence the centraliser of j 
containing semiu (8)  z2. of course, semispin(16) is such a subgroup, but there is
another. the exceptional lie group e7 has a maximal rank subgroup [22] isomorphic to
su (8)/z2, and in fact one can prove that e7 contains a disconnected subgroup with two

connected components, one being su (8)/z2. combining this with a pin(2) subgroup
of su (2), we obtain, after suitable identications, semiu (8)  z2 as a subgroup of
8 in e8 is
8 turns out to be just semispin(16); this is important in

su (2)  e7, which is a maximal subgroup of e8. in fact, the centraliser of j 
su (2)  e7, while that of j 

applications [9].

one of the most interesting and important applications where the distinction be-

tween so(4m) and semispin(4m) is crucial concerns k3 compactications of the
(e8 e8)z2 heterotic theory. when the instanton numbers are assigned symmetrically

to the two factors, one nds [9] that the corresponding (t-dual) so(32) conguration
corresponds to a semispin(32) bundle which does not lift to a spin(32) bundle. this

is the semispin analogue of the failure of the orthonormal frame bundles over certain
riemannian manifolds [14] to lift to spin bundles. if a semispin(32) bundle does lift to

19

a spin(32) bundle, then it will automatically dene ( by projection ) an so(32) bundle;
and so a semispin(32) bundle which fails to lift to a spin(32) bundle is said to lack a

vector structure.

examples of such semispin(4m) bundles can be given by once again exploiting
2m is of order two, whereas j2m, its counterpart in spin(4m), satises
the fact that j 
( j2m)2 = (1)m k4m and so is of order four (like j2m). this makes it possible to
construct a non-trivial u(1) bundle over a two - cycle in the base, such that connections
on this bundle satisfy the usual (dirac) integrality conditions, but their pull-backs to

a covering bundle would not. when this u(1) bundle is extended to a semispin(32)
bundle, therefore, the latter cannot be lifted to a double cover. it is in precisely this way

that the dual partner of the above [9] (e8  e8)  z2 compactication is constructed.
one could not wish for a more striking conrmation of the importance of the distinction

between so(4m) and semispin(4m).

in this spirit, we ask whether u (1) is indeed the precise global form of the gauge

group in question. this u (1) may be identied as the explicit u(1) in [u (1) 

(su (16)/z2)]/z4, but we know that this group is most naturally regard as the identity
component of semiu (16)  z2. therefore one should really regard the canonical u (1) in
semispin(32) as the identity component of u (1)z2 or o(2) in the notation of theorem

1. ( the corresponding subgroup of so(32) consists of all 32  32 matrices of the form

(cid:18) i16 cos  i16 sin 

i16 cos  (cid:19) (cid:18) i16 cos 

i16 sin 

i16 sin 

i16 sin 

i16 cos (cid:19). ) more generally, semispin(4m) has

a canonical subgroup of the form

u (1)[ k 

2m  u (1),

where u(1) corresponds to the lie algebra element (cid:18) 0 i2m
diag (cid:18)(cid:18) 0 1

0 (cid:19), or to its conjugate
2m)2 = (1)m, we
see that the global structure is o(2) if m is even, but p in(2) if m is odd ( see theorem

0(cid:19) , . . .(cid:19) if one prefers. recalling that (k 

0(cid:19) ,(cid:18) 0 1

i2m

1 ). one can actually prove that semispin(4m) has no p in(2) subgroup containing u(1)
when m is even, and no o(2) subgroup containing u (1) when m is odd.

in constructing semispin(4m) bundles without vector structure, then, one should

really begin with non-trivial o(2) or p in(2) bundles. ( of course, if the base manifold is
simply connected, such a bundle will always reduce to a u (1) bundle, but realistic string

compactications are not likely to be simply connected. ) now we know that a u (1)
instanton breaks semispin(4m) to semiu (2m); what is the corresponding subgroup

20

for o(2) or p in(2) ? since k 
2m acts by complex conjugation on all of semiu (2m), the
answer is the real subgroup of semiu (2m). the real subgroup of su (2m) is so(2m),
2m; nally, 1, the cen-
while that of su (2m)/z2 is p so(2m), and u (1) contributes j 
tral element of semispin(4m), must of course also be included. thus an o(2) or p in(2)
instanton will break semispin(4m) to

z2  z2  p so(2m),

m even,

z2  z2  so(2m),

m odd,

with one z2 generated by 1 and the other by j 
2m. in particular,then, an o(2) instanton
in a semispin(32) theory will reveal itself by the presence of p so(16) where semiu (16)
might be expected. (note that this same pso(16) arises in the spin(16)



spin(16) subgroup of semispin(32), as the diagonal subgroup.)

before concluding this section, we draw the readers attention to the following
point. while it is true that spin(4m)/{1,  k4m} is isomorphic to spin(4m)/{1, k4m},
the isomorphism is through an outer automorphism of spin(4m) which can change
the way in which a given sub-algebra is embedded in the algebra of spin(4m), and
this in turn can aect the global structure of the subgroup to which that sub-algebra

exponentiates. a simple example is provided by spin(4) = su (2)  su (2). obviously
su (2)  so(3) is isomorphic to so(3)  su (2), but it is true that a given, xed su (2)

algebra exponentiates either to su (2) or to so(3), depending on whether one factors by
{1, k4} or {1,  k4}. we have chosen to dene semispin(4m) by factoring {1,  k4m}
when m is odd, but one could decide to factor by {1, k4m}, though in that case j 
2m
will not commute with k 
if one does this, then
[u (1)  su (2m)]/zm no longer projects to [(u (1)/z2)  su (2m)]/zm. instead we have

2m and it will not be of order two.

k4m = ( j2m)2 = [z1, z i2m]m,

where z is a primitive (2m)-th root of unity. this gives us k4m = [zm1, z i2m]m =
[1, zm i2m]m, because, since m is odd, m  1 is even. thus in fact k4m = [1, i2m]m,
and so the quotient of (u (1)  su (2m))/zm by {1, k4m} is isomorphic to [u (1) 
(su (2m)/z2)]/zm, which is not isomorphic to [u (1)/z2  su (2m)]/zm. thus there
is no unique subgroup of semispin(4m) corresponding to u (2m) unless one species

precisely which projection from spin(4m) to semispin(4m) one proposes to use.

our point of view is that for physical applications it is important that j 

2m should
be of order two rather than, like j2m and j2m, of order four. this is stressed repeatedly,

21

for example, in ref.[9]. this xes the projections : we must factor out {1, k4m} when
m is even, and {1,  k4m} when m is odd.

v. subgroups of semispin(4m) corresponding to sp(1)  sp(m).

another subgroup of so(4m) which is important in various applications (see, for
example, ref. [21]) is the symplectic group sp(m), which embeds through sp(1)sp(m).

the latter has the global structure [sp(1)  sp(m)]/z2. the corresponding subgroup
of semispin(4m) is given as follows.

theorem 4 : the lie algebra inclusion sp(1)  sp(m)  so(4m) has the following
counterparts at the lie group level.

sp(1)  sp(m)  so(4m)

sp(1)  sp(m)  spin(4m)
sp(1)  sp(m)  spin(4m)

so(3)  p sp(m)  p so(4m)
so(3)  sp(m)  semispin(4m)
so(3)  p sp(m)  semispin(4m)

m odd
m even

m odd
m even

here a dot denotes a factoring by a diagonal z2, and p sp(m) = sp(m)/z2.

proof: consider rst the case of spin(4m). we know that spin(4m) contains a
subgroup of the form [u (1)  su (2m)]/zm, consisting of pairs [u, s]m. evidently we
have

[1, i2m]m = [1, i2m]m

when m is even, but not when m is odd. that is, the z2 in u (1) is identied with the
z2 in su (2m) when m is even, but not when m is odd. however, this u (1) is contained

in sp(1), and su (2m) contains sp(m); furthermore the central z2 in sp(1) is the z2 in
u (1), and the central z2 in sp(m) is identical to the z2 in su (2m). thus we see that

the central z2 in sp(1) is identied, in spin(4m), with the central z2 in sp(m), if and
only if m is even. hence the group is sp(1)  sp(m) if m is odd, but sp(1)  sp(m) if

m is even.

we saw, in the proof of theorem 3, that (1)m k4m = [1, i2m]m, the generator of
the z2 in sp(1). hence sp(1)  sp(m) projects to (sp(1)/z2)  sp(m) when m is odd,
while sp(1)sp(m) projects to (sp(1)/z2)(sp(m)/z2) when m is even. recalling that

sp(1)/z2 = so(3) and sp(m)/z2 = p sp(m), we have the stated results. similarly, in
so(4m), the central z2 coincides with the z2 in sp(1) and sp(m), so taking the quotient

22

throughout sp(1)  sp(m)  so(4m), we obtain so(3)  p sp(m)  p so(4m). this
completes the proof.

notice that the theorem asserts that so(3)  sp(1) is contained in semispin(4),

which is correct since the latter is so(3)su (2) and su (2) = sp(1). it also asserts that
semispin(8) = so(8) contains so(3)  p sp(2), which is correct since sp(2) = spin(5)

and so p sp(2) = so(5). the theorem gives us so(3)  p sp(8) as the subgroup of
semispin(32) corresponding to sp(1)  sp(8) in so(32); this agrees with ref.
[21],
where the importance of the so(3) factor, appearing unexpectedly as a subgroup of

semispin(32), is explained. ( note that the full cover of sp(1)  sp(m) in spin(4m), m
even, is actually z2  sp(1)  sp(m), where z2 = {1}; this projects to z2  so(3) 

p sp(m), so one might give this as the correct subgroup of semispin(4m).)

vi. conclusion

the semispin groups are of fundamental importance in string theory. the gauge

groups of type i and one of the heterotic theories are both semispin(32) precisely, while
spin(10)
e8 contains semispin(16); the latter in turn contains (see theorem 2) spin(6)

= [su (4)  spin(10)]/z4, and so it provides a possible route to spin(10) grand uni-
cation.

these facts alone warrant a detailed study of the semispin groups and their remark-

able subgroups. theorem 1 places semispin(4m) in the context of the entire family of
non-trivial groups locally isomorphic to so(n), while theorems 2,3, and 4 list the most

important subgroups. we hope that these theorems will be a useful reference for string
theorists.

the most surprising nding of this investigation is no doubt the fact that semispin

groups do not contain smaller semispin groups. this implies that the  common
so(16)  so(16) subgroup of e8  e8 and semispin(32) simply does not exist, which
is obviously a problem for duality. this problem can be overcome by going to a common

double cover, but only if certain topological obstructions vanish. in some circumstances,
therefore, duality can be obstructed topologically. we shall study this phenomenon else-

where.
