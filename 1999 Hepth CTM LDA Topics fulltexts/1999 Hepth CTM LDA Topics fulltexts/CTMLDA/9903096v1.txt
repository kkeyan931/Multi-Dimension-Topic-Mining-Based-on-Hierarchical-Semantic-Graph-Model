abstract

the interplay between between gauge-eld winding numbers, -vacua, and the dirac operator
spectrum in nite-volume gauge theories is reconsidered. to assess the weight of each topological
sector, we compare the mass-dependent chiral condensate in gauge eld sectors of xed topological
index with the answer obtained by summing over the topological charge. also the microscopic
dirac operator spectrum in the full nite-volume yang-mills theory is obtained in this way, by
summing over all topological sectors with the appropriate weight.

introduction

although the chiral sul(nf )sur(nf ) symmetry of qcd is not spontaneously broken in a nite
volume, it has long been known that many low-energy aspects of nite-volume qcd nevertheless can
be derived from an eective chiral lagrangian [1]. this is because the dominating degrees of freedom
can still be the would-be n 2
f  1 pseudo-goldstone bosons (which are simply called pions in what
follows) of the presumed chiral symmetry breaking pattern of sul(nf )sur(nf )  su(nf ) in the
innite volume limit. clearly at least two scales are of relevance here: if the linear extent l of the
four-volume v is much larger than the compton wavelength 1/m of the pions, the eect of the nite
volume is mild, and can be treated as a small correction to the low-energy results of the theory in
innite volume. what is at rst sight much more surprising is the fact that even in the opposite limit,
when the pion compton wavelenght much exceeds the size of the box, the eective partition function
still becomes of a very simple chiral lagrangian type. the procedure to derive this eective theory
is to treat the zero modes of the pion eld as new collective coordinates in the low-energy expansion.
when all the dust has settled, the resulting leading-order lagrangian coincides with what one would
have obtained by the naive procedure of simply discarding all derivative terms in the innite-volume
chiral lagrangian [1]. independently of whether chiral symmetry is spontanenously broken or not, the
pseudoscalar states we here generically denote by pions are guaranteed, by exact mass inequalities, to
be the lightest avor non-singlet mesons in qcd [2].

naively one might think that an eective lagrangian technique as described above can provide infor-
mation only about the chiral order parameter   h i itself, or just soft pion dynamics. however,
as shown by leutwyler and smilga [3], low-energy constraints on nite-volume gauge theories can,
remarkably, be used to provide very non-trivial information about quark and gluon degrees of freedom
as well. specically, the large-volume identication of the original qcd partition function and the
eective lagrangian restricted to the region

carries a lot of exact information about the spectral correlators of the smallest eigenvalues of the dirac
operator. while this holds for the full partition functions involved, the scoop of ref. [3] was to note
that the analysis simplies considerably if one focuses on gauge eld sectors of xed topological charge
. the eective partition function then becomes analytically solvable. it is thus possible to do a direct
analytical comparison between, on one side, the full qcd partition function, and, on the other side,
the eective partition function. one of the most striking outcomes of this analysis was the derivation
of exact spectral sum rules for the dirac operator in qcd and qcd-like gauge theories [3, 4].

surprisingly, the analysis of the spectral properties of the dirac operator in nite-volume gauge eld
theories at xed topological charge [3] has turned out to have an alternative description in terms of
random matrix theory [5, 6]. the root of this equivalence lies in the universality of the random
matrix theory predictions: there is a huge class of random matrix theories that, in the appropri-
ate scaling limit, yield exactly the same spectral correlation functions [7, 8, 10, 11]. remarkably,
so-called chiral versions of the three classical random matrix theory ensembles have been shown
by verbaarschot to provide precisely the needed three universality classes of chiral symmetry break-
ing in gauge theories with dierent gauge groups and dierent color representations of the fermions
[12]. while there are obvious resemblances here to the classication of critical behavior in terms of
universality classes in statistical mechanics, the analogy should not be pushed too far. there is no
renormalization group at work here, and the way qcd ts into one of these three universality classes

1

is by means of algebra (or, at a deeper level, symmetry) rather than dynamics. indeed, within the last
year it has become well understood how all the universal predictions derived from random matrix
theory can be rephrased in terms of the eective qcd partition function, suitably extended with
additional quark species [13]. even universality of the results can easily be understood directly from
the universality of the random matrix theory partition functions [14] and the equivalence between
the eective chiral lagrangian and the specic random matrix theory with gaussian distribution,
which was established in [5]. by means of partially quenched chiral lagrangians, it is now also possible
to derive directly from the eective qcd partition function the microscopic spectral density of the
dirac operator, without any bypass through random matrix theory at all [15]. all these more recent
results permit us to say much more about the microscopic dirac operator spectrum in nite-volume
gauge theories. it is therefore appropriate to reconsider the analysis of ref. [3] in this new light.

it is thus partly by historical coincidence that almost all analytical predictions about the microscopic
dirac operator spectrum and the mass-dependent chiral condensate have been derived in gauge sectors
of xed winding number . from the point of view of the real theory, where one sums over all
topological sectors, this is analogous to knowing only the fourier modes of a periodic function. while
it may be interesting to study just these fourier modes (and in the case of qcd much can indeed be
learned from them), we would still rather like to know the full function. for qcd this means that we
should know the predictions for the full theory at any given value of the vacuum angle , or, at least,
since there are very stringent experimental bounds on the magnitude of this cp-violating -angle, for
the specic value of  = 0.

the problem of summing over all winding numbers becomes particularly important when we consider
tests of the analytical predictions for qcd sectors of xed topological charge  by means of lattice
gauge theory. because lattice gauge congurations are not smooth on the scale of the lattice spacing,
the very denition of gauge eld topology is from the beginning an ambiguous concept. with so-called
staggered fermions there is no help from index theorems (which otherwise can serve as an alternative
denition of topological sectors) because there are no guaranteed exact zero modes away from the
continuum limit [16].
in fact, lattice gauge theory data for qcd with staggered fermions and no
restrictions on lattice eld topology show remarkably good agreement with the analytical predictions
for just the sector of zero winding number,  = 0. this phenomenon was rst observed in comparisons
of lattice data with analytical formulas for the mass-dependent chiral condensate [17]1, and later
precisely the same eect was seen in lattice simulations of the microscopic dirac operator spectrum
with staggered fermions [18, 19]. one can argue that just because staggered fermions have no exact
zero modes, this explains the puzzle. are present-day lattice gauge theory simulations with staggered
fermions thus only probing the sector of zero topological charge?2 despite the problem mentioned
above, lattice gauge eld congurations generated by conventional monte carlo algorithms cannot
all be classied as topologically trivial. they contain a distribution of congurations that smoothly
fall into the precise topological sectors of the continuum theory as the lattice cut-o is decreased.
of course, in a given monte carlo sampling the sector corresponding to  = 0 will be dominant.
to understand the signicance of just these congurations we need to know not only the analytical
predictions for given sectors of xed topological index, but also the weight with which these dierent
topological sectors are contributing to full qcd. very recently it has become feasible to address
this in lattice gauge theory [21, 22]. but in the nite-volume region (1), these questions can also
be answered analytically. for qcd-like theories the relevant partition functions at xed topological

charge  are known in closed analytical form [24]. it is simple to show that these xed- partition
functions precisely give the non-trivial weights with which each xed- observable contributes to the
full answer. using this fact, we assess in section 2 the importance of the  = 0 sector in bulding up the
mass-dependent chiral condensate of the full theory. section 3 is devoted to the microscopic spectral
density of the dirac operator, and we carry out the analogous procedure of summing over topological
charges.
interestingly, one of the simple conclusions is that in the massless case the microscopic
spectral density of the dirac operator in the full theory simply equals that of the  = 0 sector. this
holds for all nf  2. the case nf = 1 is  as expected  special, and there are then additional
zero-mode contributions to the full microscopic spectral density from just the two sectors of  = +1
in the massless limit just these two zero-mode contributions to the spectral density
and  = 1.
provide the required non-vanishing condensate for nf = 1, even in this nite-volume situation. by
numerically performing the sum over topological charges, we show how the full microscopic spectral
density changes away from the  = 0 prediction as the mass is increased for dierent values of nf .
we point out a diculty with taking the quenched limit, and briey discuss the more exotic chiral
symmetry breaking cases, which correspond to dierent symmetries of the dirac operator. all of the
predictions described here can be tested in lattice gauge theory simulations. in fact, one of our main
points is precisely that one can simultaneously test both the detailed analytical predictions in xed-
sectors, and the predicted weight with which these sectors build up the full answer (which, in principle,
should be much easier to measure). section 5 contains our conclusions.

2 summing over winding numbers

we begin with a few basic denitions. consider qcd in euclidean space on a nite 4-dimensional
torus. its four-volume can be taken to be just l4, or l3/t . the former case leads in the l  
limit to ordinary zero-temperature qcd, while in the latter case, if we take t xed, the l   limit
gives euclidean qcd at (small3) temperature t . for our purposes there is no need to distinguish
between the two cases, as the innite (three-)volume limit of the chiral condensate just must be chosen
appropriately. the four-volume is in both cases denoted by v . as discussed at length in e.g. refs.
[3, 25], gauge elds on such a four-torus can be described by a gauge potential a(x) on the full
euclidean space, plus a transition function (x), which describes the transition from one periodic cell
to another (possibly non-trivial because a(x) need only be periodic modulo gauge transformations).
on the lattice one often prefers to work with strictly periodic gauge link variables (and hence trivial
transition function), but by a gauge transformation these links can be made equivalent to a set of
link variables with a non-trivial transition function. in the continuum such a gauge transformation
will, however, necessarily be singular. non-trivial winding numbers arise precisely from non-trivial
transition functions [25].

for an su(nc) gauge theory with nf fermions in the fundamental representation, antiperiodic bound-
ary conditions on the four-torus for these fermions the topological charge

 =

runs over integer values. with a -term in the action, the partition function thus reads

z() =

where z is like a fourier transform of the full partition function:

(4)

(5)

consider rst the case nf  2, and assume that chiral symmetry in the innite-volume limit breaks
spontaneously according to sul(nf )sur(nf )  su(nf ). as shown in ref [1], the eective partition
function then takes on a very simple form in the nite-volume region (1):

z() = zsu (nf )

du exphv re [ei/nf trmu ]i ,

(6)

where m is the quark mass matrix4, and  is the innite-volume chiral condensate (for the massless
[3] is that these
theory with  = 0). one of the main lessons to learn from the analysis of ref.
nite-volume eective partition functions for nf  2 in surprisingly many ways resemble the nite-
volume partition function with nf = 1. in fact, although the case nf = 1 is radically dierent in that
the axial u(1) symmetry is broken by the anomaly rather than spontaneously, the eective partition
function turns out be given by what one naively could have extrapolated from (6), namely the simple
exponential [3]

(7)
in all cases the eective partition functions depend only on the combination i  v mi. keeping
i xed as the four-volume v is taken to innity thus entails taking the chiral limit in a correlated
manner. moreover, the bound (1) must be satised throughout.
in statistical mechanics such a
procedure is known as nite-size scaling, and the i are nite-size scaling variables.

z() = exphv re[eim]i .

the fourier coecients z have been computed analytically for all nf [3, 24]. for nf  2 they can
conveniently be written

where the nf  nf matrix a({i}) is (in(x) is the modied bessel function of order n)

is the vandermonde determinant. with an obvious interpretation of the formula (8), it even includes
the case nf = 1, for which [3]

one notices that the general expression (8) is symmetric in ,

z() = i() .

as follows also directly from the original denition, eqs. (5) and (6).

4from now on we always take this mass matrix to be real and diagonal: m = diag(m1, . . . , mnf ).

z({i}) = z({i}) ,

2.1 the chiral condensate for nf = 1

having already observed that in the limit (1) the relevant scaling variables are i = v mi, we from
now on try to eliminate as many factors of v and  as possible. we hence measure all mass-dependent
chiral condensates (;{i}) in units of , and eectively work with a unit four-volume. the mass-
dependent chiral condensate for nf = 1 is then simply dened by

(; ) =




lnz(; ) .

(13)

in this nf = 1 case the result is trivial and in fact -independent: (; ) = cos(), as follows from
eq. (11).5 in any case, we shall mainly be concerned with the case  = 0, for which, in our units,
(0; ) = 1.

let us now compare with what we would nd if we were to restrict ourselves to gauge eld averages
over xed topological charge only. as already observed by leutwyler and smilga [3], this restriction
is quite drastic. by denition,

() =




lnz() ,

(14)

(15)

which gives

() =

1

i() (cid:20)i+1() +




i ()(cid:21) .

for  positive, the last term can easily be traced to the || zero modes of the dirac operator /d: in
terms of the non-zero dirac eigenvalues n the original partition function (3) reads

z() =



x=yf

(mf )||eiz [da]yf yn

[2

n + m2

f ]esy m [a] ,

(16)

and the last term in (15) precisely matches the term due to the prefactor m||. however, when 
is negative this interpretation is not correct: in that case the sign of the second term in (15) is just
the opposite of what is needed. there is no mystery here, but only a slight complication which
we shall return to in section 3.1.
indeed, from the very denition (14) and the property (12), the
mass-dependent chiral condensate (15) is seen to be symmetric in : () = (). therefore the
obvious  1/ singularity in eq. (15) for  > 0 is actually matched by a singularity of exactly the
same strength for  < 0.

we start by considering the case  = 0. in g. 1 we show () for a few small values of , and
compare each of them with the full answer (). contrary to the full answer which in this nite-
volume limit is just the trivial constant  = 1, the chiral condensates in individual xed- sectors
have non-trivial mass dependences. in this case we certainly cannot conclude that the  = 0 sector
adequately reproduces the full answer. but xed- chiral condensates also show another disturbing
feature, which we already mentioned above: for  6= 0 they diverge in the limit   0. actually, the
second term in eq. (15) by itself does not contribute to the full sum over topological sectors. to see
this, we rst derive a simple formula that tells us how to relate the full chiral condensate (; ) to
the chiral condensates () in sectors of xed topological index:

(; ) =




lnz(; )

5the -dependence of the condensate is not interesting; for  6= 0 it simply shifts from h i to h  5i [3].

the relation (17) tells us with which weight the chiral condensates in xed topological sectors con-
tribute to the full answer: each () comes with weight factor eiz (). in g. 2 we show how
the full answer, the constant  = 1 for  = 0, is built up as we sum over topological charge  from a
given ||max to +||max in eq. (17). perhaps surprisingly, we nd that the  = 0 contribution alone
is not very signicant, never exceeding more than around 20% of the full answer. in the shown range
of  we also see that by summing from, say,  = 8 to  = +8 we essentially obtain the complete .
the divergences that appear in () for  6= 0 are obviously completely removed when one performs
the required average over topology. in the present case of  = 0 this can easily be seen analytically.

 6= 0 the contribution from + precisely cancels the contribution from . next, substituting the
bessel function identity



eii() = e cos() ,

(20)

we of course recover the correct result ( = 0; ) = 1 from eq. (19).

for a non-zero vacuum angle  the /-term in () does not disappear as simply when we sum
over dierent topological sectors. again this nf = 1 case is very illustrative. now, using some simple
bessel function identities, we have

where in the last line we have agin used eq. (20). in this case the second term in (15) is certainly
required to obtain the right answer from the sum (17). more generally, we also learn from eq. (17)
that the   0 singularities in () for  6= 0 are killed in the sum over topological sectors because
these divergences are weighted by eiz (). in general, z ()  nf || for small . this follows both
explicitly from the representation (6), or, in the original qcd language, from the dirac determinant
and the index theorem. thus only for nf = 1, and in that case only for the sectors with  = 1,
can these 1/ singularities in () give any non-zero contribution to the massless chiral condensate.
in fact, one easily checks that in this case just these two contributions precisely yield the nite value
(; 0) = cos(), as required [3].

because the full sum is guaranteed to be real, this means that in some sense even for  6= 0 the
contribution of this term to (; ) is only apparent; it only serves as to remove a corresponding
imaginary part from the rest of the sum, leaving a remaining real answer.

figure 4: the full chiral condensate () for nf = 2,  = 0, and equal masses . we again compare
dierent approximations, by summing only over the rst few topoloigcal sectors. the  = 0 sector is again not
particularly signicant.

we now check to which degree of accuracy the chiral condensate (; ) for nf = 2 and  = 0 (i.e.
eq. (24)) coincides with just the chiral condensate in xed- sectors (26). this is shown in g. 3 for
a few small values of . the divergent zero-mode contributions of course make the condensates for
 6= 0 very dierent from the complete answer. and actually in this nf = 2 case the chiral condensate
in just the  = 0 sector at least has the qualitatively right behavior. but again, to see to what extent

9

the dierent topological sectors contribute to the full answer, we must add up the dierent sectors
with the right weight. in g. 4 we show how the full chiral condensate (24) is built up as we sum over
topological charge  from given ||max to +||max in eq. (22). as in the nf = 1 case, we nd that
the  = 0 contribution alone is not particularly signicant at all. it is obviously a generic feature,
which is not specic to the very special circumstances of nf = 1. the cases with nf  3 are indeed
not qualitatively dierent [26], and we do not display any of them here.

3 the microscopic spectral density

eigenvalues n of the dirac operator are dened by i /dn = nn, and the spectral density is then

(;{i})  hxn

(  n)i ,

(28)

where the average includes the sum over topological sectors. because the weighting is done with the
fermion determinant, the density depends on the masses i too. the double-microscopic limit is taken
by keeping all i = v mi and  = v  xed as v  . the denition (28) of course extends to
averages in xed- sectors as well:

()(;{i})  hxn

(  n)i

(29)

we now go to the double-microscopic limit. as for any other gauge-eld expectation value in xed-
sectors, also the microscopic spectral density ()
s (;{i}) can be summed to give the microscopic
spectral density of the full theory:

s(; ,{i}) = z(;{i})1



x=

eiz({i})()

s (;{i}) .

it is useful to separate out the zero-modes explicitly:

s(; ,{i}) = z(;{i})1

 s(; ,{i}) + hh||ii() ,



x=

eiz({i})h()

s (;{i}) + ||()i

(30)

(31)

with an obvious denition of s(; ,{i}).
it has been shown [13, 15] that the microscopic spectral density (29) without zero-mode contributions
can be expressed directly in terms of the eective partition function,

(34)

where the determinant on the right hand side is taken in terms of the n  n matrix in the arguments
a, b.

the full microscopic spectral density without zero-mode contributions, s(; ,{i}), takes a particu-
larly simple form in the massless limit. using z0(0) = 1 and z(0) = 0 for all  6= 0, we immediately
get

s(; ,{i = 0}) = (=0)

s

(;{i = 0}) .

(35)

that is, in the massless limit the full microscopic spectral density without zero modes simply coincides
with the corresponding density of the  = 0 sector. note in particular that in this massless limit the
full microscopic spectral density is independent of the vacuum angle . this is as expected: in qcd
with at least one massless avor any -angle can be removed by a chiral rotation.

the result (35) may seem to contradict the fact that in the nf = 1 theory the chiral condensate is
(;  = 0) = cos() even though the massless limit is taken at nite volume. indeed, even at nite
volume there is a kind of banks-casher relation for the microscopic spectral density too,

lim

s(; , )
 2 + 2 = s(0; , 0) = (=0)

(36)

this microscopic spectral density alone can therefore never give rise to a condensate in the massless
nite-volume theory. but the full condensate potentially also receives contributions from the zero
modes, even at zero mass. this part equals (taking nf equal masses for simplicity)



(nf )1hh||ii = [nf z(;{i})]1

eiz({i})||



x=

= 2[nf z(;{i})]1

cos()z({i}) .

(37)

in the limit   0 this expression vanishes for all nf  2. in view of (36) this just means that for
nf  2 there are no chiral condensates in the massless limit, in agreement with the fact that there
cannot be spontaneous symmetry breaking in these nite-volume theories. for nf = 1 and  = 0 the
sum in (37) can be performed analytically, giving [3]

1hh||ii = e[i0() + i1()] ,

(38)

whose limit at  = 0 indeed equals unity, as required in order to obtain  = 1 in that case. in general,
for  6= 0 we note again that because of the behavior in(x)  x|n| as x  0, only the  = 1 terms
contribute to the sum when   0, yielding precisely the required 1hh||ii  cos() in the limit
  0.
inserting the formula (32) into the denition of s(; ,{i}) in eq. (31) gives an interesting compact
expression for the full microscopic spectral density:

s(; ,{i}) = z (nf )(;{i})1

while this formula strongly resembles the one for xed , we note the eect of the (1) -factor in the
individual ()
s (;{i})-contributions: the partition function with two additional fermion species (in
the numerator) is to be evaluated at a shifted vacuum angle:  + . thus even if we insist on getting
the physical microscopic spectral density with  = 0 (or at least exceedingly small), we need to know
also the eective qcd partition function with two more avors, and with a non-vanishing vacuum
angle.

one can perform a similar summation over topological charge of all microscopic spectral correlators
()
s (1, . . . , n;{i}). however, the representation (33) does not give a a convenient compact expres-
sion, due to the fact that the determinant must be taken inside the summation over . fortunately,
there exists a dierent expression for ()
[13]), which,
s (1, . . . , n;{i}) (see the third paper of ref.
although more unwieldy in general when  is xed, is more convenient in this context:

function corresponding to the actual number of fermions nf .

the full eective partition function (6) is unfortunately not known in closed analytical form for nf  3.
so to evaluate the right hand side of eq. (39) it is most convenient to simply perform the sum over
topological charges numerically. we know already the full answer in the massless case (35), and it is
thus interesting to trace the change in s(; ,{i}) as the mass is increased. in g. 5 we show the
full microscopic spectral density for the nf = 1 theory with  = 0. the  = 0 curve indeed coincides
exactly with the massless prediction of just the  = 0 sector [6]

as the mass increases, sectors with higher values of || begin to contribute. because the oscillations in
()
s (; ) are shifted to the right as || increases, there is a certain amount of destructive interference,
and the full microscopic spectral density becomes smoother as  is increased. the limit   , which
naively should correspond to the quenched theory, is ill-dened, as will be discussed below.

figure 6: the full microscopic spectral density of the nf = 2 theory with  = 0. when both fermion masses
are set to zero we recover the  = 0 result. when one of the masses is taken to innity, we recover the full
microscopic spectral density of the nf = 1, by decoupling.

the case nf = 2 is more interesting. because of the simple identication (35), the 1 = 2 = 0 limit
simply reproduces the massless nf = 2 density of the just the  = 0 sector,

in another extreme limit, when, say, 2  , this second fermion decouples. if we still take 1 = 0,
we thus recover the simple massless prediction of just the  = 0 sector of the nf = 1 theory, eq. (41).
for intermediate masses, there is again some amount of destructive interference that smoothes out the
microscopic spectral density. shown in g. 6 are the two limits mentioned above, and one example of
the prediction for intermediate masses.

3.1 careful with the sign of 

we have already noticed that the symmetry (12) under    also implies ({i}) = ({i}).
but this holds only if we consider all contributions, including the /-piece. for example, for nf = 1
(and  = 0) the two terms on the right hand side of eq.
(15) are not separately invariant under
  , but the sum is. this has consequences for our denition of the microscopic spectral density
()
s (,{i}), which does not include the contribution from zero modes.
it follows from eq. (12) and the representation (32) that also

()
s (,{i}) = ()

s

(,{i}) .

(43)

clearly also the full microscopic spectral density (29) is thus symmetric under   . let us for
illustration consider one of the massive spectral sum rules for nf = 1, which was derived in ref. [26]
for the case   0. first, by denition,

[3]. these considerations of course trivially generalize to any nf ,

the nf = 1 case that we have used as an example here is particularly simple also when it comes to
an analytical check on our formula for the full microscopic spectral density (39). in that case one can
explicitly conrm the relation

(; ) = 2z

since all the involved integrations can be performed analytically. (the left hand side is of course just
the trivial constant cos() in this case, and the full spectral density s(; , ) is indeed just a function
that achieves this -independence of the right hand side as well).

14

3.2 trouble with the quenched limit

the quenched limit of nf  0 is not easily taken. in gauge-eld sectors of xed topological charge ,
the quenched mass-dependent chiral condensate reads [17, 15]

() =  (i ()k() + i+1()k1()) +




,

(48)

where kn(x) is the modied bessel function. this quenched chiral condensate also satises () =
(). it shares the  1/ divergence with the unquenched condensates when  6= 0. in the latter
case we have already seen that this divergence is harmless in the sense that it is killed once we sum
over topological charge. here this is no longer true. if we simply assume that z () = 1 for all  in
the quenched limit, it is not even possible to sum over topological charge. there is now no suppression
of higher- contributions, and the sum in

(; ) =

1

z(; )



x=

ei()

(49)

does not converge. if one tries to regularize the sum by introducing some maximum topological
charge ||max and dening

=+||max

z(; )reg 

ei() ,

x=||max

(50)

eq. (49) still has no well-dened limit as ||max  . this failure of convergence is not related to
the   0 singularities in xed- sectors; it arises here from the innite summation over topological
charge, if, in the quenched approximation, we assume that each topological sector enters with equal
weight z() = 1. it is clearly invalid to make this assumption. in fact, in the pure gauge theory
the topological susceptibility t = hh2ii (in our units) is a well-dened and nite number, and the
distribution of topological charge is believed to be gaussian in the innite-volume limit [27]:

z
z 

1

2t

e 2/2t .

(51)

it is tempting to simply insert this ansatz for z into eq. (49) instead of unity, but it is not quite
consistent. the whole framework here is based on chiral ward identities, of which [28]

nfhh2ii = 

(52)

indeed is a direct consequence of these nite-volume partition functions [3]. taking the quenched limit
detaches us from this tight constraint, and a dierent analysis is required to establish the behavior
of z as a function of .
in any case, the   0 singularities are no longer removed by the sum
over topological charge, because the distribution of z will be -independent. this  1/ singularity
in the (full) quenched chiral condensate has recently been conrmed by direct lattice measurements
using domain-wall fermions [20].

with these observations, we should certainly expect diculties with the quenched microscopic spectral
density. the quenched microscopic density in a gauge eld sector of xed  reads [6, 17]

()
s () =

1

2||hj ()2  j+1()j1()i .

(53)

15

according to eq. (31), and if we again take z() to be a -independent constant (say, unity), the
sum in

s(; ,{i}) = z(;{i})1

x=



eiz({i})()

s (;{i})

(54)

again requires regularization. introducing a maximum topological charge ||max   as above, we
actually nd a remarkable regularity. let us for convenience restrict ourselves to  = 0. shown in g.
7 is a series of successive summations with increasing ||max. the resulting function is approximately
linear6, until, at a point that shifts to innity with increasing ||max, it turns over into the constant
value 1/. the slope of the linear part thus depends on the choice of ||max, and there is no convergence
of the sum. as discussed above, the approximation of taking all z to unity is just drastically wrong.

figure 7: summing over topological sectors with incorrect weight:

if in the quenched theory one simply
assumes that z = 1 the resulting microscopic spectral density becomes linear up to the value 1/, where it
turns at. this point where the linear part is replaced by a at part moves to innity with increasing ||max,
and thus has no limit.

another way of reaching the quenched limit is by decoupling all nf fermions in any given theory by
sending all masses to innity. for simplicity taking nf = 1, and sending the mass  to innity, we
obtain precisely the same kind of curve as obtained above in the naive way of just summing over each
xed- sector with equal weight. the cut-o which controls the point where s() turns from linear
to at behavior is now played by this mass . this suggests that decoupling all fermions by taking
all their rescaled masses i to innity is not providing a physical limit of the full theory.
indeed,
one easily checks that in this extreme limit all partition functions z become independent of , thus
explaining why the two dierent ways of trying to obtain the quenched microscopic spectral density
described here fail in precisely the same manner.

how does this result t in with the general formula (39)? taking the nf  0 limit in that equation

6i thank s. nishigaki for rst pointing this out to me.

16

gives

s(; ) =

1

2||z (2)( + ; i, i)

z (0)()

.

(55)

for the quenched microscopic density we thus need the eective partition function for nf = 2, which
fortunately is known in analytical form (see eq. (23)). for simplicity taking the case of  = 0, we
indeed nd from eq. (23) that

s(;  = 0) =

1

2z (0) || .

(56)

the density consistently comes out linear, and again with an undetermined constant in front. to
determine this constant we would normally impose the matching condition of s(  ) = 1/, an
impossible requirement in this case. again, the failure of these attempts at taking the quenched limit
in this framework is perhaps not surprising. the presumed distribution (51) concerns by construction
only the pure gauge sector, for which no information can be gained via the (anomalous) chiral ward
identities on which the present framework is based. moreover, in the pure gauge theory we can sum
over gauge eld congurations with also fractional winding numbers [25]. in the large-nc limit the
topological susceptibility in the quenched theory is, via the witten-veneziano relation [29], related to
the avor singlet  mass. in the quenched limit, where the anomaly plays no role, the  should be
treated as a (pesudo)-goldstone boson too. perhaps an analogue of the large-nc eective lagrangian
with built-in information about the topological susceptibility of the pure gauge theory (as required
by the witten-veneziano relation, at least at large nc) can be used to treat this case in a consistent
manner.

figure 8: the partially quenched chiral condensate (v, ) in the nf = 1 theory with  = 0. the
quenched mass is indicated by v, while  is the real physical mass, here taken to be unity for convenience.
the sum over topological charges converges everywhere, except at the point v = 0. in this case the divergence
at v  0 can easily be worked out analytically (see eq. (59)), and for comparison we display also just the
resulting 1/v term with the coecient as given in eq. (59).

there are no such diculties with partial quenching. for example, the dependence of the partially
quenched chiral condensate on the (quenched) valence quark mass v is computed in the full theory

17

by averaging with respect to the usual xed- partition function z. this sum converges for v 6= 0.
to be concrete, consider the analytical expression for the nf = 1 case which was derived in the second
of ref. [15]:

(v, ) = v [i+1(v)k+1(v) + i+2(v)k (v)]

in g. 8 we show this as a function of v for  = 0 (which of course does not exhibit the 1/v-
singularity), and xed value of the physical sea quark mass . we also show the full answer, for the
same mass , obtained by summing over winding numbers according to

(; v, ) = z(; )1



x=

eiz() (v, ) ,

(58)

where in this case z(; ) = exp[ cos ], and z() = i().
the partially quenched cases are particularly interesting because they provide a limit in which the
 1/v divergences of the quenched approximations are under full control from the analytical point
indeed, the coecient of the 1/v-term in the partially quenched nf = 1 theory can be
of view.
computed analytically in this nite-volume limit; it equals

hh||ii = e(i0() + i1()) .

(59)

this curve has also been included in g. 8, and one clearly sees how accurately it describes the 1/v
singularity.

3.3 extensions

the present results easily extend to the other two major classes of chiral symmetry breaking [12]. the
analytically most simple case is that corresponding to gauge group su(nc  3) and nf fermions in
the adjoint representation (which in random matrix theory language corresponds to the chse). for
example, from the relations derived in the second of reference [13] we know that we in this case can
express the microscopic spectral density of the dirac operator in a sector of topological charge  by

s (;{i}) = c4  3 z
()

(nf +4)


({i},{i})
({i})

(nf )


z

.

(60)

also this can be summed over topological charge  to get the full microscopic spectral density for that
case. using a similar relation for all higher k-point functions [13]

(61)

also these k-point functions can be averaged over topological charges to yield a ratio of two full partition
functions, without restrictions to topology. in these relation each (imaginary) additional fermion mass

18

on the right hand side is four-fold degenerate. unfortunately, the relevant xed- partition functions
are not in general known in closed analytic form, and the proportionality constants in both of the
above relations have therefore not yet been determined. until this has been done, and in particular
their -dependences have been found, we cannot explicitly identify the combination of nite-volume
partition functions that will emerge from the sums.

4 conclusions

we have here considered the eect of summing over all topological charges , while remaining in the
nite-volume scaling regime dened by eq. (1). for the mass-dependent chiral condensate the eect of
summing over topological sectors is quite drastic. for example, the condensate actually diverges like
 1/ in the   0 limit if one restricts oneself to any sector of non-vanishing topological charge ,
even though the full condensate vanishes as   0 (except for the case nf = 1). the microscopic dirac
operator spectrum itself is also substantially modied by the summation over topological charges. a
simple compact relation gives the full microscopic spectral density in terms of a ratio of partition
functions, one of which is evaluated at a shifted vacuum angle    + , and with two additional
fermion species. we have pointed out a diculty with obtaining the quenched (nf  0) limit in this
simple way. the diculty disappears if one focuses instead on a partially quenched limit, in which
the appropriate weight factors in the sum over topological numbers again are known exactly in this
nite-volume regime. we have also noted a drastic simplication in the massless case, where the full
microscopic spectral density actually coincides with the one of the sector with  = 0.

an interesting open question is whether one can establish a compact random matrix theory formu-
lation also for the full eective partition function z(;{i}). although we believe the answer to be
negative, we are not aware of any strong argument to that eect.

in future lattice studies it seems obvious to try to study not just the microscopic dirac operator
spectrum in sectors of xed , but also the associated distribution of congurations labelled by the
topological index. thanks to very recent developments this is now possible [21, 22]. this way one can
test simultaneously the probability distribution of congurations with xed topological index (which
is known analytically in the regime (1) and given, for  = 0, simply by z({i})/z( = 0;{i})),
and, simultaneously, the full microscopic dirac operator spectrum. such numerical simulations with
dynamical fermions now seem feasible.
