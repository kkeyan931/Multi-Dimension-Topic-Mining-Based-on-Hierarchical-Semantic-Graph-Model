abstract

we compute the high-temperature limit of the free energy for four-dimensional n = 4

supersymmetric su (nc) yang-mills theory. at weak coupling we do so for a general

ultrastatic background spacetime, and in the presence of slowly-varying background gauge

elds. using maldacenas conjectured duality, we calculate the strong-coupling large-nc

expression for the special case that the three-space has constant curvature. we compare

the two results paying particular attention to curvature corrections to the leading order

expressions.

1. introduction

there is substantial evidence to support maldacenas conjectured duality relating

superstring theory in anti-de sitter (ads) spacetime and a conformal eld theory (cft)

[1][2][3] for a comprehensive review, see ref. [4]. in particular, type iib superstring theory
on ads5s5 is dual to four-dimensional n = 4 super-yang-mills (sym) theory with gauge
group su (nc) [1]. an interesting aspect of this duality is the study of the behavior of

the sym theory at nite temperature [1][3][5][7][8][9][10][11][12]. in the superstring theory

for suciently high temperatures, the thermal state is described by an asymptotically

ads black hole [1][3]. one nds that, at a qualitative level, one recovers many of the

expected physical properties of the thermal sym system from the black hole geometry. a

quantitative comparison is more dicult because supergravity provides a description of the

sym theory at strong coupling, and so no direct calculations can be made reliably in the

sym theory. in some cases [7][14], e.g., the free energy density, perturbative calculations

at weak coupling still reproduce the strong coupling results up to factors of order one. so

it would appear that the corresponding coecients are smooth functions of the eective

coupling which interpolate between the strong and weak coupling results. in the case of

the free energy density, subleading corrections have been calculated at both strong [10]

and weak [11] coupling, and the results are suggestive that the interpolation may even be

achieved by simply a monotonic function.

whether or not there is a smooth interpolation between strong and weak coupling is a

question deserving close scrutiny. by carefully examining the expansions of the free energy

at small and large coupling, and by making some simple assumptions about the behavior of

the expansion coecients, li [12] has argued that it is impossible to smoothly interpolate

between these two coupling regimes of the sym theory. hence li concluded that there

must be a phase transition at some critical coupling when the sym theory is at any nite

temperature. the primary motivation for the present paper was to investigate the free

energy calculations in more detail to look for evidence of such a phase transition. as well

as introducing a nite temperature, we consider the sym theory on a curved background

space. finite temperature is included by working with a four-dimensional, ultrastatic

2

euclidean spacetime for which the euclidean time direction is periodically identied with

period  = 1/t . for the spatial geometry, we pay particular attention to three-geometries
of constant curvature /2 (with  = 0, 1) since these are the cases for which we may
also compute the strong-coupling free energy using the ads/cft correspondence. when

comparing the results obtained for weak and strong couplings, we follow how they depend
on the radii,  and , in the limit /  1 (which corresponds to the high-temperature
limit).

we organize the paper as follows: section 2 states the preliminaries, describing the

n = 4 super-yang-mills theory. section 3 then addresses the weak-eld calculation, which

may be performed quite generally, using well-known heat-kernel techniques. we com-

pute the weak coupling eective action for sym at nite temperature, and in the pres-

ence of slowly-varying background gauge and gravitational elds. the strong-coupling

string/supergravity calculation is then given in section 4. a brief discussion of our results

is given in section 5.

2. n = 4 super-yang-mills theory

the eld content of n = 4 sym theory [15] is {aa

r}, where a = 1, . . . , dg runs
over the adjoint representation of the gauge group, g, i = 1, . . . , 4 counts the spin-half

i , a

, a

elds, and r = 1, . . . , 6 labels the scalars. where necessary we will choose g = su (nc),
c  1, although this choice does not play an important role in the weak

for which dg = n 2

coupling calculations.

the action of the theory may be conveniently formulated in terms of n = 1 superelds,

of which we require one gauge multiplet, w a
adjoint representation. the action is then given by minimal kinetic terms for all elds,

l, and three matter multiplets, a

m, all in the

gauge interactions, plus those interactions derived from the n = 1 superpotential:

w =

i2
3!

mnp cabc a

n c
p.

(1)

here cabc represent the completely antisymmetric structure constants for the gauge group.

3

this superpotential is manifestly invariant under a global su (3) avour symmetry

(acting on the indices m, n and p), as well as a u (1) r-symmetry for which the charge
assignments of the elds are r(w a
3. these are subgroups of a
larger su (4) avour symmetry which this model enjoys, dened as the automorphism

l) = 1 and r(a

r ) = 2

of the supersymmetry algebra which rotates the four supersymmetry generators amongst
themselves. only the su (3) ur(1) subgroup is manifest when the theory is expressed in
terms of n = 1 superelds.

the theory is also scale invariant, even at the quantum level [16]. this may be argued

within perturbation theory using the nonrenormalization theorems of n = 2 supersym-

metry, or by constructing the most general n = 1 supersymmetric action with this eld

content which admits the above-mentioned su (4) symmetry.

and spontaneously break the gauge group, the global su (4) symmetry and scale invariance.

a number of goldstone and massless gauge multiplets therefore gure prominently among

the low-energy states, at least at weak coupling.

in the following, we will examine the free energy of this theory at nite temperature

and in curved background spacetimes. a nontrivial result arises because both the tem-

perature and background curvatures typically break supersymmetry, thereby permitting a

nonvanishing free energy. in all ways but one, the action we use for curved spacetimes is

the same as the one just described, albeit with the substitution everywhere of covariant

(with respect to dieomorphisms) derivatives. the only nonminimal change required is

that the scalars couple conformally to the ricci scalar [3]. this ensures the conformal

invariance of the theory for general background metrics.

3. weak-coupling calculation

we now outline the weak-coupling calculation of the eective action and free energy

density. our approach is to compute the contribution of the short-distance, ultraviolet

part of the theory to the free energy using the well-established gilkey-dewitt heat-kernel

methods [19][17][20][6](see also [18]), which we will briey review. after the heat kernel

discussion we examine what inferences may be drawn from these methods about the long-

distance contributions to the free energy.

3.1) heat-kernel methods

heat-kernel techniques are based upon the following representation of the functional

determinants which appear at one loop. assuming euclidean signature in an n-dimensional

spacetime [19][20][6],

(3)

where the upper (lower) sign is for bosons (fermions), dv is the covariant volume element,

and k(x, y; s) satises the equation:

k
s

+(cid:16) + m2 + x(cid:17) k = 0,

(4)

with initial condition k(x, y; s)  n(x, y) as s  0.

part of the utility of this representation lies in the observation that the contribution

of the short-distance part of the system to  is controlled by the small-s behaviour of

k(x, y; s). furthermore, this small-s behaviour has been computed once and for all, for
general choices for the operator  + x.

concretely, if k(x, y; s) is expanded for small s:

k(x, y; s) = k0(x, y; s)

ak(x, y) sk,



xk=0

with k0(x, y; s) an appropriately-chosen function [6], then  takes the following form:

where ta and j represent the generators of gauge and lorentz transformations on the

3.2) applications to spins zero, half and one

we next record the above expressions for the three spins of interest in the present

problem. for the moment we leave the dimension of spacetime arbitrary, although  with

1 in this section, we adopt the curvature conventions of ref. [13].

dimensional regularization in mind  we imagine evaluating n = 4  2 at the end of the
calculation. our results are given in the presence of background metric and gauge elds.

(background scalars are also implicitly included through the dependence on the particle

mass, m.)

 spin zero: for spinless particles we consider the operator  + m2
0 +  r acting on
real scalar elds, where the choices  = 0 and  = 1
6 respectively correspond (in four
dimensions) to a minimally-coupled and conformally-coupled scalar. denoting the gauge

generators as represented on scalars by ta, and assuming that we have n0 scalars sharing

the same value of  we nd:

and so the ak(x, x) become:

y = i f a

tr 0 a0(x, x) = n0,

here, and in what follows, rs denotes the gauge representation of the particles of spin s,
and the dynkin index, c(r), is dened by tr(tatb) = c(r) ab. we normalize the gauge
generators so that c(f ) = 1

 spin one half: without loss of generality we represent spin-half particles using majorana
, for which the determinant is not
spinors. for such elds the operator of interest is / + m1
well-dened. in the absence of anomalies in the lorentz or gauge group, we instead dene
this determinant as the square root of the determinant of(cid:16)/ + m1

in addition to the vector potentials, each spin-one particle also requires a fadeev-

popov-dewitt ghost, which contributes like a minimally-coupled complex scalar in the

adjoint representation, however it is an anticommuting eld. combining the vector and

ghost contributions gives, for n1 spin-one particles:

note that tr a2 takes the form familiar from the conformal anomaly in which the coecient

3.4) uv finiteness on ultrastatic spacetimes

as may be seen from the form of the integrals, ck, of eqs. (6) and (7), the coecients

tr ak(x, x), for k = 0, 1, 2 determine the ultraviolet divergences of the four-dimensional

theory (n = 4). the vanishing of the k = 0 and k = 1 terms in eqn. (20) and the fact

that the expression for the k = 2 term in eqn. (21) depends only on the background

curvature (due to the cancellation among dierent spins of terms proportional to f a

 f 
a )
is a check on the calculation. it shows that this theory, on at spacetimes, is ultraviolet

nite at one loop, as expected. we now show that this cancellation also occurs for arbitrary

four-dimensional ultrastatic spacetimes.

the nite-temperature calculation of the next section is performed for ultrastatic

spacetimes. these admit metrics for which coordinates may be locally chosen to ensure

ds2 = d 2+mndxmdxn, where the spatial metric, mn, is independent of  . since any such

metric is eectively three-dimensional, both its squared weyl tensor and its gauss-bonnet

integrand must vanish identically:

cc = rr  2 r r +

r2 = 0
rr = rr + 4 rr  r2 = 0.

1
3

(22)

eq. (22) may be used to eliminate the quantities rr and rr in terms of r2,

with the result:

rr = r r =

1
3

r2.

(23)

it is now obvious that eq. (21) vanishes when eq. (23) are used. thus we see that

n = 4 sym is uv nite at one loop on all four-dimensional ultrastatic spacetimes. this
result also extends to background geometries which have a product structure, e.g., s2s2.
again, since the individual components of the metric are lower dimensional in such a case,

one nds the vanishing of eq. (22). however, note that for more general backgrounds, it is

quite possible for tr a2(x, x) to be nonzero. for instance, for four-dimensional maximally
symmetric spaces r = 1

12 r (gg  gg), and so 4rr = r2, giving

tr a2(x, x) = 

dg
24

r2 6= 0.

(24)

in such cases logarithmic uv divergences would appear in the eective action.

3.5) nonzero temperature

10

the calculation of the ultraviolet part of the one-loop eective action for nonzero

temperature is performed along lines very similar to the zero-temperature result just de-

scribed[21][18]. we do so by restricting to the ultrastatic metrics of the previous section,

and periodically identifying the euclidean time  with period  = 1/t . the only change

required in the previous calculation is to nd the heat kernel which is periodic  or, for

fermions, antiperiodic  in time.

such a kernel may be obtained from the one used above at zero temperature through

the method of images:

k(t  t, x, x; s) =



xn=

()nk(t  t + n, x, x; s).

(25)

where, again, the upper (lower) sign is for bosons (fermions). this sum may be evaluated

within the small-s expansion for the ultrastatic spacetimes of interest here because the
time-dependence of k0(  , x, x; s) is quite simple:

k0(  , x, x; s) = k0(x, x; s) exp(cid:20)

(  )2

4s

(cid:21) .

(26)

expanding k for small s, as in eq. (5), and using the known form for k0, one nds [21]:

k(x, x; s) = k0(x, x; s)



xn=

()n exp(cid:18)

n22

4s (cid:19) .

(27)

the sums may be performed, giving standard jacobi -functions [23]:

k+(x, x; s) = 3( ) k0(x, x; s),

k(x, x; s) = 4( ) k0(x, x; s),

(28)

where  = i2/(4s).

substituting eq. (28) into expression (3) for the eective action, one then nds that

the free energy density is:

f =

skn/2 exp(m2s) 4(cid:18)i2

(30)

these integrals diverge for k = 0, 1 and 2 if n = 4 due to the limit of integration
at s  0. this innity is an ultraviolet divergence, and is removed if one focuses purely
on the temperature-dependent part of the problem. this is accomplished by computing
()
k = c()
k ck, which gives the change of the free energy relative to the zero-temperature
result: f = f (t )  f (0).

the potential infrared divergence as s   does not arise so long as m is nonzero,
so ()
k may be evaluated numerically to any desired accuracy. for our later purposes,
however, it is instructive to examine the high-temperature limit, m  t . this limit can
be subtle due to the shadow cast by incipient infrared divergences which can re-emerge in
this regime. a well-known example of this occurs in at space, since (+)

acquires terms

0

such as m3t when expanded in powers of m/t [24], [25]. this nonanalytic dependence of
(+)
on m2 as m2  0 thwarts its evaluation via term-by-term integration after expanding
its integrand in powers of m2, since the successive integrals which are obtained in this way

0

diverge more and more severely in the infrared. such nonanalytic dependence on m2 is

characteristic of the singularities which arise in the presence of massless particles.

for nontrivial background elds we see that evaluating at m = 0 causes the ()

to
diverge at s   for suciently large k. this is very similar to the divergences which
are found when a series in powers of m2 is attempted in the absence of background elds.

k

in this case the divergences are a consequence of a breakdown of the derivative expansion

due to the nonanalytic dependence on the background elds which is generated as the

curvatures cut o the infrared singularities which are generated by the various massless

modes [27].

in four dimensions these divergences potentially arise at m = 0 when k  2. we
now explicitly display the rst of these by evaluating the terms k  2 of the gilkey-de

here tr b ak and tr f ak respectively denote the trace over the bosons and fermions of the

model. the ellipses within the square brackets represent terms which neither diverge, nor

involve the logarithm of t . by contrast, the ellipses at the end of the equation represent

terms which involve higher than two powers of curvature and gauge eld strengths.

the infrared divergence arises in eq. (32) as the pole as n  4 in the k = 2 term
of the series. notice that the condition for the cancelling of this particular divergence is

tr b a2 = tr f a2, which is precisely the condition for the cancelling of the zero temperature

logarithmic ultraviolet divergence. as a consequence this particular divergence does not

arise in the present example of n = 4 sym, although the same is not expected to be true

for the infrared divergences arising for higher k.

evaluating this expression using the aks of n = 4 sym, and using the simplications,

eq. (23), which follow from the restriction to an ultrastatic spacetime, nally gives:

in the next section we compute the free energy density in the strong-coupling limit

using the ads/cft correspondence [1]. we do so for the special case of vanishing back-

ground gauge elds, and for the specic case where the spatial three-geometry has constant
curvature the ricci scalar for such a space may be written as r = 6/2, where  is
the radius of curvature, and  = +1, 0, 1 for a three-sphere, at space and a hyperbolic

appropriate class of metrics describing euclideanized black holes is [28]

where  = +1, 0, 1 and d3(k) is the line element on a three-dimensional manifold with
constant curvature /2. an explicit representation of the latter may be chosen as

d3() = 2(cid:20)(1  2)dz2 +

d2

(36)

but the precise form of the three-dimensional metric will not be needed in the following. all
of these ve-dimensional metrics (35) satisfy the equation of motion,3 r = (4/2)g,

3 note that there is a change of conventions for the curvatures between this section and the previous one.
those of this section follow those of ref. [26], since these are conventional in the gravity literature. although
the metric signature remains +++, we must replace rr in all formulae.

now, the euclidean action evaluated for the classical black hole metric is interpreted as

giving the leading contribution to the free energy. in the context of ads black holes, such

calculations were rst carried out in ref. [29]. as typically arises in these calculations, how-

ever, this action diverges and so to produce a nite result, we subtract o the contribution

of a reference metric [30]. this step is analogous to subtracting o the zero-temperature

free energy in the eld theory calculation  see section 3.5. in this case, the reference

geometry is simply anti-de sitter space which is produced by setting r0 = 0 in eq. (35).

taking care to match the asymptotic geometries correctly, one nds

i = v3 f = v3

(40)

note that in dening i = v3f , the relevant volume is essentially the coordinate

volume of  and d3(). it is not the proper volume of a surface of constant radius at
large r in eq. (35), which of course diverges as r  .

now the duality prescription [1] identies g55 = 83g24 and 4 = 4gnc2,

where g and  are the string coupling constant and the inverse string tension, respectively.

combining these formula then yields the free energy density at strong coupling for su (nc)

sym in the large-nc limit:

f = 

2n 2
c t 4

f(cid:18)2

the latter is now in a form which is readily compared to the weak coupling result (34).

for the  = 0 case, of course, the leading term is the full answer up to corrections

in the eective coupling. for the  = +1 and 1 cases, similar calculations yielding the

curvature corrections appear in refs. [14] and [31], respectively.

notice that for  = 0 or 1, i in eq. (40) is always negative, and so the black hole

solution (35) always provides the dominant saddle-point in the supergravity path integral

for any temperature. on the other hand, for  = +1, i becomes positive for r+ < ,

which corresponds to  > 2/3. hence in this low temperature range, ads space itself

is the dominant saddle-point. this change at  = 2/3 is believed to be associated with

a deconnement phase transition in the sym theory [5].4 for comparision to the weak-

coupling calculation, we are interested in the high temperature regime where the black
hole is the dominant ads saddle-point for all three choices,  = 0, 1.

5. discussion

in comparing the free energy densities calculated at one loop (34) and strong coupling

(41), we see that these expressions, while not identical, yield two expansions which look

4 note that below this phase transition at =/2, there is a branch point in f( 2/2). this corresponds

to the minimum temperature for which a black hole solution with =+1 exists.

16

very similar. both give a free energy having a high-temperature limit which has the form

of a taylor expansion in powers of 2/2:

f = 

c t 4
2n 2

xn=0

bn()(cid:18) 2

22t 2(cid:19)n

(44)

where the coecients bn() are functions of the eective t hooft coupling,  = g2
4/(22).

ymnc =

the signicance of this observation for the strong-coupling expansion is in what

in particular, the weak-coupling expansion had the poten-

eq. (44) does not contain.
tial to involve both fractional powers of 2/2 (similar to the m3t term in (+)
), as well
as terms proportional to log  (such as when tr a2 6= 0). such terms reect the infrared
divergences which are associated with the massless bosons of the perturbative spectrum.

0

they do not arise at one loop in the weak-coupling calculation due to the cancellations

in tr a2, which reect the niteness and conformal invariance of n = 4 sym theory in

ultrastatic background geometries. this same cancellation does not hold in general for

all terms in the weak-coupling limit. for instance, even on at space the massless gauge

bosons generate infrared divergences to perturbative calculations of thermal quantities like

gluon damping rates [32], once one proceeds beyond one loop. the same might also be
expected to follow for the k  3 terms of the derivative expansion at one loop.

unlike the weak-coupling result, the strong-coupling expression, eq. (42) is not simply

given as an asymptotic form for large temperatures, but is explicitly given in terms of the
function f (2/2) for the geometries of interest. explicit examination of f (x) clearly
shows it to be analytic in its argument near x = 0, indicating the absence of singularities

in the high-temperature regime. but the existence of exact conformal invariance of the

underlying model ensures the absence of a gap in the particle spectrum. in four dimensions

this follows directly if the ground state respects the conformal invariance, or from the

existence of a goldstone dilaton mode if the conformal symmetry is spontaneously broken.

infrared divergences would be expected to be weakened or absent if the only massless

states were goldstone modes [33], since these decouple in the long-wavelength limit [34].

the absence of infrared singularities in the large temperature limit of the strong-coupling

17

calculation therefore indicates either the existence of only goldstone massless modes, or

the persistence into the large-nc limit of the one-loop cancellations of infrared divergences

which were seen at weak coupling for non-goldstone massless modes.

notice there is no singularity predicted by eq. (42) for any other temperatures, in

spite of the branch point which apparently arises at x = 2/2. this branch point has no
direct implications because: (i) x = 2/2  0 if  = 1; (ii) the function f (x) collapses
to a constant (and hence the branch point vanishes) if  = 0; and (iii) the branch point

lies outside the high temperature domain of validity ( < 2/3) of the strong-coupling

calculation if  = +1.

the behaviour we nd is consistent with the behaviour which was previously argued

for n = 4 sym by witten [5]. it would be of interest to extend other techniques which

have proven powerful in at space, such as those of ref. [35], to analyse the curved spaces

considered here in more detail. in particular, so far as they go our results are consistent

with a qcd-like picture in which no phase transition occurs for any nite coupling, c.

although our calculation cannot reveal the functional form for bn() away from the
limits   0 and   , it does dier in some ways from similar calculations of the
free energy density in the higgs phase of the sym theory [8]. in that case, the results

suggest that the strong-to-weak coupling interpolation is achieved with a single overall

multiplicative function. while one might have hoped for a similar simple form in the

present calculation, it is clear from our expressions that this is not the case. rather, the

weak coupling form (34) determines

b0(0) = 1 ,

b1(0) =

3
4

,

b2(0) = 0 ,

(45)

while the strong coupling expansion (41) xes

b0(  ) 

3
4

,

b1(  ) 

3

,

b2(  )

.

(46)

following the arguments presented in ref. [14], the free energy densities calculated

using euclidean techniques above also have an interpretation as casimir energy densities.

18

the latter arises if the wick rotation back to a minkowski signature manifold is made on

an appropriate time coordinate in the constant curvature three-manifold. then eqs. (34)
and (41) yield the casimir energy density for sym on ds3 s1, r3 s1 and ads3 s1 for
 = +1, 0 and 1, respectively. the negative casimir energy is generated by antiperiodic
boundary conditions on the s1 factor for the fermions.

finally, in closing, we remark that the calculations in section 3 show that in a general

curved space, n = 4 super-yang-mills need not be nite. we observed though that for

background geometries with a product structure into two (or more) lower dimensional

components, uv niteness is maintained due to a remarkable cancellation of terms in

tr a2, which is given in eq. (21). indeed, in the nite temperature calculations, niteness

arose because of the ultrastatic form of the background metric, which gives a product
structure of the form s1  m3. of course, it is not dicult to nd backgrounds where no
such cancellation occurs. for example, consider the simple case of s4, which is maximally

symmetric with r = 12/2 where  is the radius of curvature. in this case eq. (24) implies

the nonzero result

tr a2 =  6

n 2
c
4 ,

(47)

and hence a logarithmic uv divergence appears in the sym eective action.

it is not dicult to choose coordinates on ve-dimensional ads space such that the

boundary manifold (i.e., the asymptotic regulator surfaces) is s4, i.e.,

ds2 =

dr2
1 + r2
2

+ r2d4

(48)

where d4 is the standard metric on a unit four-sphere. now the logarithmic uv di-

vergence appearing at one-loop in the sym eective action would at rst sight seem to

present a problem for the proposed ads/cft correspondence, but in fact, it provides a

remarkable consistency check [37]. the ads/cft correspondence provides a new set of

intrinsic surface terms [36],[37] (for related work, see [38]) for the gravitational action (37).

remarkably, these new terms render the gravitational action nite except precisely in the
case where tr a2 6= 0 for the boundary surface.

in the latter case, the volume integral

19

produces a logarithmic divergence instead. for the s4 boundary, one can precisely match

this divergence with that appearing in the dual eld theory calculation [37]. hence, in

keeping with the uv/ir relation [39] of the ads/cft correspondence, one again nds

that an ultraviolet divergence in the eld theory is matched by an infrared divergence in

the supergravity.
