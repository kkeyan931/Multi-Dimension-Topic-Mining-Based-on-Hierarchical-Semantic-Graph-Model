see {$9511164$} details) obtained acting v j(x, x) vacuum. radial quantization vacuum corresponds x = 0, hence incoming states correspond limx0 v j(x, x)|0i. expanding j(x, x) modes, (3.5), see mode creates state spacetime cft = = j 1. modes larger must kill vacuum, smaller contribute limit x 0. similarly, n1 states created acting vacuum n1 x j(x, x). modes create states = j n. modes (3.26) discussed section 3 related m; create states acting vacuum x . thus, least string theory ads3 modes (3.26) corresponding principal discrete series certainly create physical states spacetime theory. perhaps x surprising something similar seems going sl(2)/u (1) case. second comment concerns physical interpretation spectrum (3.34). known {$9511164$} dynamics winding modes cigar sl(2)/u (1) equivalent t-duality motion particle potential attractive small goes constant large . spectrum contains bound states corresponding principal discrete series, continuum gap, corresponds normalizable states j = 1 2 + i. discrete states presumably thought 19 original variables sort bound states whose wave function supported near tip cigar. states j = 1 2 + make wave packets live arbitrarily far tip cigar arbitrary momentum (hence continuum). easy verify using (3.24), (3.34) continuum starts right highest mass discrete state (in sector given n , l), expected form potential winding modes {$9511164$}. one ask whether normalizable states j = 1 2 + included lst. case, seems us necessary observables theory create states vacuum. class observables analyzed paper, non-normalizable fundamental string operators, seem couple states. observables either, would inclined believe modes decouple lst dynamics8. returning spectrum (4.1), conclusion density states lst grows exponentially energy, hagedorn temperature bulk theory, seems odds discussion {$9511164$}, argued hagedorn temperature fact lower (roughly) factor k (and thus density states grows rapidly energy (4.1)). attitude apparent discrepancy following. analysis {$9511164$} applies language energies e >> mw x, computed spectrum excitations energies e << mw . nd hagedorn growth density states (4.1) smaller h {$9511164$} range ms << e << mw . reasonable expect density states e >> mw much higher agrees {$9511164$}. regime e >> mw strongly coupled description dicult study directly. learned many examples last years, typically states protected supersymmetry reliably counted strong coupling. perhaps d-brane states preserve supersymmetry background (3.18) would resolve discrepancy (see {$9511164$} recent discussion). finally, vacua lst discussion applies correspond theories vebranes wrapped around riemann surfaces, relevant describing strongly 8 issue confused fact {$9511164$} correlation functions non- normalizable operators cft sl(2)/u (1) one typically instructed sum normalizable states internal channels. nevertheless, seems singularity structure resulting correlation functions interpreted purely terms states bound tip cigar. 20 coupled gauge theories using branes {$9907178$}. hope results help improve understanding. acknowledgements: thank o. aharony, t. banks, o. pelc, m. porrati, j. teschner, c. vafa a. b. zamolodchikov useful discussions. also thank itp santa barbara hospitality course work. d.k. thanks het group rutgers university hospitality. research supported part nsf grant #phy94-07194. work a.g. supported part israel academy sci- ences humanities centers excellence program, bsf american-israel bi-national science foundation. d.k. supported part doe grant #de-fg02- 90er40560. 21
