abstract

a necessary condition that a stackel-killing tensor of valence 2 be
the contracted product of a killing-yano tensors of valence 2 with itself
is re-derived for a riemannian manifold. this condition is applied to
the generalized euclidean taub-nut metrics which admit a kepler
type symmetry. it is shown that in general the stackel-killing tensors
involved in the runge-lenz vector cannot be expressed as a product
of killing-yano tensors. the only exception is the original taub-nut
metric.

1 introduction

the euclidean taub-nut metric is involved in many modern studies in phy-
sics. hawking [1] has suggested that the euclidean taub-nut metric might
give rise to the gravitational analog of the yang-mills instanton. in this case
einsteins equations are satised with zero cosmological constant and the
manifold is r4 with a boundary which is a twisted three-sphere s3 possessing
a distorted metric. the kaluza-klein monopole was obtained by embedding
the taub-nut gravitational instanton into ve-dimensional kaluza-klein

theory. on the other hand, in the long-distance limit, neglecting radiation,
the relative motion of two monopoles is described by the geodesics of this
space [2, 3].

from the symmetry viewpoint, the geodesic motion in taub-nut space
admits a hidden symmetry of the kepler type if a cyclic variable is gotten
rid of [4, 5, 6, 7]. in general the hidden symmetries of the manifold man-
ifest themselves as tensors of valence r > 1, satisfying a generalized killing
condition [8]:

k(1...r;r+1) = 0.

(1)

they are usually referred to as stackel-killing tensors. the conserved quan-
tities along geodesics are homogeneous functions in momentum p of degree
r, and which commute with the hamiltonian

h =

gpp

(2)

in the sense of poisson brackets.

in the taub-nut geometry there are known to exist four killing-yano
tensors [9]. three of these exist by virtue of the metric being self-dual. they
are complex structure realizing the quaternionic algebra and the taub-nut
manifold is hyper-kahler [5]. in addition to these three vector-like killing-
yano tensors, there is a scalar one which has a non-vanishing eld strength
and it exists by virtue of the metric being type d.

for the geodesic motions in the taub-nut space, the conserved vector
analogous to the runge-lenz vector of the kepler type problem is quadratic
in 4-velocities, its components are stackel-killing tensors and they can be
expressed as symmetrized products of the killing-yano tensors [5, 10, 11, 12].
the killing-yano tensors play an important role in the models for rela-
tivistic spin one half particles involving anticommuting vectorial degrees of
freedom, usually called the spinning particles [13, 14, 15, 16]. the congura-
tion space of spinning particles (spinning space) is an extension of an ordinary
riemannian manifold, parametrized by local coordinates {x}, to a graded
manifold parametrized by local coordinates {x, }, with the rst set of vari-
ables being grassmann-even (commuting) and the second set grassmann-odd
(anticommuting). in the spinning case the generalized killing equations are
more involved and new procedures have been conceived [15, 12]. in particu-
lar, if the killing tensors can be written in terms of killing-yano tensors ( and
that is the case of the taub-nut space), the generalized killing equations
can be solved explicitly in a simple, closed form.

2

in the last time, iwai and katayama [17, 18, 19, 20] extended the taub-
nut metric so that it still admits a kepler-type symmetry. this class of
metrics, of course, includes the original taub-nut metric.

the aim of this paper is to investigate if the stackel-killing tensors in-
volved in the conserved runge-lenz vector of the extended taub-nut me-
trics can be also expressed in terms of killing-yano tensors.

the relationship between killing tensors and killing-yano tensors has
been investigated to the purpose of the lorentzian geometry used in general
relativity [21, 22]. in the next section we re-examine the conditions that a
killing tensor of valence 2 be the contracted product of a killing-yano tensor
of valence 2 with itself. the procedure is quite simple and devoted to the
riemannian geometry appropriate to euclidean taub-nut metrics.

in section 3 we show that in general the killing tensors involved in the
runge-lenz vector cannot be expressed as a product of killing-yano tensors.
the only exception is the original taub-nut metric.

our comments and concluding remarks are presented in section 4.

2 the relationship between killing tensors

and killing-yano tensors

suppose we are given a 4dimensional riemannian manifold m and a metric
g(x) on m in local coordinates x. the distance ds between two innites-
imally nearby points x and x + dx is given by

ds2 = g(x)dxdx

(3)

where the g(x) are the components of a symmetric covariant second-rank
tensor. we decompose the metric into vierbeins ea


g = abea

eb



where ab = ab, a, b = 0, 1, 2, 3 and consequently

ds2 = xa=0,1,2,3

(ea)2

with the orthogonal one-forms ea = ea

dx.

(4)

(5)

let 2 be the space of two-forms 2 := 2t (r4 {0}). we remind that
a tensor f1...r is called a killing-yano tensor of valence r if it is totally
antisymmetric and it satises the equation

f1...(r;) = 0.

(6)

let us dene self-dual and anti-self dual bases for 2 using the vierbein one-
forms ea [23]:

(7)

let y be a killing-yano tensor of valence 2 and y its dual. the sym-

metric combination of y and y is a self-dual two-form

let us suppose that a stackel-killing tensor k can be written as the

(13)

on the other hand the killing tensor k is symmetric and it can be di-
agonalized with the aid of an orthogonal matrix. its eigenvalues satisfy an
equation of degree two:

with at most two distinct roots.

in conclusion a stackel-killing tensor k which can be written as the

square of a killing-yano tensor has at the most two distinct eigenvalues.

3 generalized taub-nut metrics

for a special choice of coordinates the generalized euclidean taub-nut met-
ric considered by iwai and katayama [17, 18, 19, 20] takes the form:

ds2

g = f (r)[dr2 + r2d2 + r2 sin2  d2] + g(r)[d + cos  d]2.

(15)

where r, r > 0 is the radial coordinate of r4  {0} , the angle variables
(, , ), (0   < , 0   < 2, 0   < 4) parameterize the unit sphere
s3, and f (r) and g(r) are arbitrary functions of r.
it is convenient for us to introduce orthonormal one-forms ea dened by

1

e0 = g(r)
e1 = rf (r)
e2 = rf (r)
e3 = f (r)

2 (d + cos d)
2 (sin d  sin  cos d)
2 ( cos d  sin  sin d)
2 dr.

1

(16)

spaces with a metric of the form above have an isometry group su(2) 

u(1). the four killing vectors are

da = r

a , a = 0, 1, 2, 3,

(17)

where

d0 =

d3 =

(18)

d0 which generates the u(1) of  translations, commutes with the other
killing vectors. in turn the remaining three vectors, corresponding to the
invariance of the metric (15) under spatial rotations (a = 1, 2, 3), obey an
su(2) algebra with

let us consider geodesic ows of the generalized taub-nut metric which

[d1, d2] = d3

(20)

where( r, , , , r, , , ) stand for coordinates in the tangent bundle. since
 is a cyclic variable

q = g(r)(  + cos  )

(21)

is a conserved quantity. this is known in the literature as the relative
electric charge.

taking into account this cyclic variable, the dynamical system for the
geodesic ow on t (r4  {0}) can be reduced to a system on t (r3  {0}).
the reduced system admits manifest rotational invariance, and hence has a
conserved angular momentum:

f (r) =

g(r) =

(23)

the metric ds2
g becomes the original euclidean taub-nut metric. as ob-
served in [5], the taub-nut geometry also possesses four killing-yano ten-
sors of valence 2. the rst three are rather special: they are covariantly

they are mutually anticommuting and square the minus unity:

fifj + fjfi = 2ij.

(24)

(25)

thus they are complex structures realizing the quaternion algebra. in-
deed, the taub-nut manifold dened by (15) and (23) is hyper-kahler. the
fourth killing-yano tensor is

fy = 8m(d + cos d)  dr

4m

+4r(r + 2m)(1 +

) sin d  d

and has only one non-vanishing component of the eld strength

fy r; = 2(1 +

r
4m

)r sin .

(26)

(27)

in the original taub-nut case there is a conserved vector analogous to

the runge-lenz vector of the kepler-type problem:



k=

k  x x =



p 



j +(cid:18) q2

where the conserved energy e, from eq. (2), is

e =

.

(28)

(29)

the components ki involved with the runge-lenz type vector (28) are
killing tensors and they can be expressed as symmetrized products of the
killing-yano tensors fi (24) and fy (26) [11, 12]:

ki

(r0ri + r0ri) = m(cid:0)fy fi



 + fy fi



(cid:1) .

(30)

returning to the generalized taub-nut metric, on the analogy of eq.(28),
iwai and katayama [17, 18, 19, 20] assumed that in addition to the angular
momentum vector there exist a conserved vector

r of the following form:





r=



p 



j +



r
r

(31)

with an unknown constant .

it was found that the metric (15) still admits a kepler type symmetry

(31) if the functions f (r) and g(r) take, respectively, the form

f (r) =

a + br

r

, g(r) =

ar + br2

1 + cr + dr2

(32)

where a, b, c, d are constants. the constant  involved in the runge-lenz
vector (31) is

 = ae +

1
2

cq2

(33)

where e is the energy(29). if ab > 0 and c2  4d < 0 or c > 0, d > 0, no
singularity of the metric appears in r4  {0}. on the other hand, if ab < 0
a manifest singularity appears at r = a/b [18].
it is straightforward to verify, as expected, that the components of the
r from (31) are killing tensors in the extended taub-nut space (15)
vector
with the function f (r) and g(r) given by (32). moreover the poisson brackets
between the components of

r are [17]:







j and

{ji, jj} = ijkjk
{ji, rj} = ijkrk
{ri, rj} = (dq2  2be)ijkjk.

(34)

our task is to investigate if the components of the runge-lenz vector (31)
can be the contracted product of killing-yano tensors of valence 2. taking
into account eq.(30) from the original taub-nut case, in general, a com-
ponent ki of the runge-lenz vector could not be expressed directly as a
symmetrized product of killing-yano tensors. the components ki can be
combined with other trivial stackel-killing tensors formed from symmetrized
pairs of killing vectors to get the appropriate tensor which has to be decom-
posed in products of killing-yano tensors.

8

in order to use the results from the previous section, we shall write the
symmetrized product of two dierent killing-yano tensors f  and f  as a
the contracted product of f  + f  with itself, extracting adequately the con-
tribution of f 2 and f 2. we note that the contracted products of f 2 and
f 2 are not new conserved quantities, being expressed in terms of the scalar

conserved quantities e, q,

2


j

.

therefore we are looking for a general linear combination between a com-
ponent ki of the runge-lenz vector and symmetrized pairs of killing vectors
which has at the most two distinct eigenvalues. a long and detailed evalua-
tion shows that the components ki only in the combination (30) with killing
vectors, just like in the original taub-nut metric, could be written as the
contracted product of killing-yano tensors provided that

d =

c2
4

.

(35)

hence the constants involved in the functions f, g are constrained, re-
stricting accordingly their expressions. it is worth to mention that for the
relation (35) between the constants c and d, the metric (32) is conformally
self-dual or anti-self-dual depending upon the sign of the quantity 2 + cr [18].
more precisely, for the weyl curvature tensor

(36)

(37)

in the basis (7) the representation matrix w of (37) takes the block

diagonal form

w =(cid:18) w +

0 w  (cid:19)

0

(38)

where w + and w  are 3  3 matrices representing the induced linear trans-
formation of the invariant subspaces 2
 respectively. if the constants
c and d satisfy (35), the extended taub-nut metric (32) with 2 + cr > 0 is
conformally self-dual and one has [18]

+ and 2

w + =

c

2(a + br)(1 + cr/2)2 w0 , w  = 0

(39)

9

where w0 is a diagonal matrix

w0 =


1

1

2


 .

(40)

for 2 + cr < 0, the metric is conformally anti-self-dual and the expressions
of w + and w  are interchanged.

finally the condition stated for a stackel-killing tensor to be written as
the square of a skew symmetric tensor in the form (12) must be supplemented
with the eq.(6) which denes a killing-yano tensor. to verify this last con-
dition we shall use the newman-penrose formalism for euclidean signature
[24]. we introduce a tetrad which will be given as an isotropic complex dyad
dened by the vectors l, m together with their complex conjugates subject
to the normalization conditions

ll = 1, m m = 1

with all others vanishing. therefore the one-forms ea will be given by

ea = ea

dx = {l, l, m, m}

and the metric is expressed in the form

ds2 = l  l + l  l + m  m + m  m.

(41)

(42)

(43)

for a stackel-killing tensor k with two distinct eigenvalues one can

choose the tetrad in such that

kij = 22

1m(i mj) + 22

2n(inj).

in this case, the form of the would-be killing-yano tensors are

fij = 21m[i mj] + 22n[inj].

(44)

(45)

again, a standard evaluation shows that the above quantity is a killing-

yano tensor only if

c =

2b
a

.

(46)

with this constraint, together with (35), the extended metric (15) coin-
cides, up to a constant factor, with the original taub-nut metric on setting
4m = a/b.

10

4 concluding remarks

the aim of this paper is to prove that only the original taub-nut space
admits killing-yano tensors and any extension of it, in spite of the existence
of stackel-killing tensors, has not this property.

this result is not unexpected. the conserved quantities ki (30) are the
components of the runge-lenz vector
in the original taub-nut
case the components ki are written as symmetrized products between the
killing-yano tensors fi (24) and fy (26). adequately the three killing-yano
tensors fi transform as a vector under rotations generated by
j like the
runge-lenz vector (34), while fy is a scalar.

k (28).





the extended taub-nut metrics are not ricci at and, consequently, not
hyper-kahler. on the other hand the existence of the killing-yano tensors
fi is correlated with the hyper-kahler, self-dual structure of the metric.

the in-existence of the killing-yano tensors causes some problems for
models of relativistic particles with spin involving anticommuting vectorial
degrees of freedom. in general the conserved quantities from the scalar case
receive a spin contribution involving an even number of grassmann variables
. for example, starting with a killing vector k, the conserved quantity
in the spinning case is

j(x, x, ) = k  x +

i
2

k[;].

(47)

the rst term in the r.h.s. is the conserved quantity in the scalar case, while
the last term represents the contribution of the spin.

a hidden symmetry is encapsulated in a stackel-killing tensor of va-
lence r > 1. the generalized killing equations on spinning spaces including
a stackel-killing tensor is more involved. unfortunately it is not possible
to nd closed, analytic expressions for the contribution of the spin to the
conserved quantities using directly the components of the stackel-killing
tensors. but assuming that the stackel-killing tensors can be written as
symmetrized products of pairs of killing-yano tensors, the evaluation of the
spin corrections is feasible [15, 11, 12, 16]. in fact the antisymmetric killing-
yano tensors are the natural geometric objects which could be contracted
with even products of the grassmann variables ,

therefore, if the killing-yano tensors are missing, it is not evident how
to compute the spin corrections to the conserved quantities corresponding to

11

hidden symmetries or even if these corrections exist. usually it is conside-
red that only the energy(2) is not aected by the spin degrees of freedom. it
seems that the absence of killing-yano tensors represent an obstruction in
the construction of supersymmetric extensions for this class of spaces.

summing up, we believe that the relation between the stackel-killing and
killing-yano tensors could be fruitful and that it should be pursued beyond
the results we have presented.
