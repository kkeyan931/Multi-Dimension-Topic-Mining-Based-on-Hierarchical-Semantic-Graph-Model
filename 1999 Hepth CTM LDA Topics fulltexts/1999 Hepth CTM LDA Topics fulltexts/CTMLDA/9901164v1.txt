abstract

by carefully analysing the picture-dependence of the brst cohomol-
ogy an innite set of symmetry charges of the closed n =2 string is identi-
ed. the transformation laws of the physical vertex operators are shown
to coincide with the linearised non-local symmetries of the plebanski equa-
tion (which is the eective eld theory of the closed n =2 string). more-
over, the corresponding ward identities are powerful enough to allow for
a rederivation of the well known vanishing theorem for the tree-level cor-
relation functions with more than three external legs.

1 introduction

there are hints that string/m -theory has a large underlying symmetry whose
improved understanding would certainly be a prerequisite for nding a general
non-perturbative denition of the theory. a toy model that might be useful in
this context is the closed n =2 string (general references are [1] - [3]). this is
not a theory of realistic physics since local (2, 2) superconformal symmetry on
the world sheet forces the target space to be a two complex dimensional ricci-
at kahler manifold. however, it has the remarkable property that contrary
to most other string theories it possesses only a single massless scalar degree of
freedom1. moreover, at tree level all its correlation functions can be calculated,
either explicitly [5] or by the more sophisticated method of berkovits and vafa
of embedding the theory into an n =4 topological string theory [6]. both meth-
ods yield the result that all correlators beyond the three-point function vanish.
this is certainly not a coincidence but suggests that a powerful target space
symmetry must be at work. such a connection is obvious from the point of
view of the eective eld theory, i.e. the eld theory that reproduces all corre-
lation functions (at tree level) of the string. in [1] it has been shown that this is
a scalar theory which describes the deviation of the kahler potential from at
space in suitably chosen coordinates. the corresponding equation of motion is
known as the plebanski equation. it possesses an innite dimensional symmetry
group (see [7] for a description and references) which, roughly speaking, is the
loop group of symplectic dieomorphisms in two real dimensions. this symme-
try should also be present in the string theory and is surely in some implicit way
contained in the approach of [6]. however, berkovits and vafa also stressed the
importance of eshing out this symmetry in a more conventional form. this
note is just an attempt in this direction.

conventionally, unbroken symmetries in string theory should show up in the
brst cohomology at ghost number one2. this is a rather general theorem of
string eld theory. the simplest example are target space translations whose
charges can be constructed from the cohomology classes cx . a more spec-
tacular example is provided by two-dimensional string theory in a linear dilaton
background (see [8] for a review and further references) where an innite set of
ghost number one cohomology classes were found at special values of the mo-
menta. the corresponding charges were shown to form an innite dimensional
algebra in [9]. moreover, it is important that these results have also been ob-
tained by matrix-model techniques, which are completely independent from the
brst approach.

despite some similarities between the 2d string and the n =2 string an
analogous situation will certainly not hold in n =2 string theory in an uncom-
pactied target space, for the very simple reason that the manifest rigid su (1, 1)

1here we count as degrees of freedom the semi-relative cohomology classes at non-zero

center-of-mass-momentum. for a dierent viewpoint, see [4].

2 in this paper we consider closed strings only and use the convention that physical states
have ghost number two. other conventions also exist, but what matters is that symmetries
have one unit of ghost number less than physical states.

symmetry in target space rules out any phenomenon taking place at some dis-
tinguished non-zero value of the center-of-mass momentum. if symmetries show
up in the brst cohomology they can do so only at zero momentum, which is
the case we should focus our attention at.

theories of closed strings have the nice property that their fock space fac-
torises into left-moving and right-moving sectors, which do not talk to each
other and are both isomorphic to the so-called chiral fock space. applying
the kunneth theorem to the closed string brst operator (which is just the
sum of left- and right-moving parts) one easily sees that the brst cohomology
also factorises. thus, the most natural way to construct a ghost number one
cohomology class is to combine a left-moving ghost number one state (which
we know to exist since this is the ghost number of physical states in the chiral
cohomology) with a right-moving ghost number zero state, or vice versa. we
therefore arrive at the important conclusion that chiral cohomology classes of
ghost number zero signal the existence of symmetry charges for the closed string
theory. this has been pointed out most clearly in [9].

summarising all the above, the rst task in analysing the symmetries of
the n =2 string is to study the chiral cohomology for vanishing momentum
and ghost number. to do this we have to choose a picture (see [10] and the
appendix). everything is very simple in the (1, 1) picture, which in many
aspects is the most natural. it is not hard to show that in this case the chiral
cohomology at ghost number zero is empty (the same happens in the (0, 1)
and (1, 0) picture)! this seems disappointing at rst but fortunately it is not
the full story: consider instead the (0, 0) picture. here, the ghost number zero
cohomology contains at least the sl(2) invariant ground state of the theory. this
state is certainly brst invariant but not trivial, for otherwise we had serious
problems with our whole formalism. thus, one sees that the zero-momentum
cohomology of the n =2 string is picture dependent [11]. an analogous property
for the ramond sector of the n =1 string has been discussed in [12].

one may wonder what happens if one goes to still higher pictures. in this
case we do not know how to avoid direct computation of the cohomology which
becomes impractical very quickly3. the (0, 1) and (1, 0) pictures can, however,
be treated this way. one nds that their cohomologies contain two states each!
from a technical point of view this is the central result of our note. since the
brst cohomology is equipped with a natural multiplication law [9], one can
take polynomials of the elements in the (0, 1) and (1, 0) cohomologies to create
more cohomology classes in higher pictures  a structure that is reminiscent of
wittens ground ring in 2d string theory. if one is willing to compare picture
number with liouville momentum, this analogy becomes a rather close one;
recall that both of these quantum numbers are the momenta of a scalar eld
coupled to a background charge. after a brief general introduction into n =2
string theory in section 2 the detailed description of the cohomology will be

3the usual method to relate the cohomologies at dierent pictures by the picture-changing
operation works for the n =1 string at zero momentum for the absolute, but not for the more
important relative cohomology [12]. in the n =2 theory it works neither for the relative nor
for the absolute cohomology [11].

presented in section 3.

having found zero-momentum states at ghost number zero it is straightfor-
ward to combine them with ghost number one states from the same picture to
form symmetry charges of the closed string. using the formalism developed in
the context of 2d string theory [13, 14] one then derives transformation laws
for the physical vertex operators which can be compared with the symmetries
of the plebanski equation. this will be done in section 4. in section 5 we de-
rive ward identities, and it will be shown that they are strong enough to imply
the vanishing of all tree-level amplitudes with more than three external legs.
this constitutes an alternative proof of the vanishing theorem of [6].
it also
unambigously shows that the picture dependence of the cohomology is not just
a bizarre side-eect of brst quantisation, but can be used to obtain non-trivial
information about the theory. in section 6 the results are summarised, and we
make a couple of remarks concerning their interpretation. an appendix, nally,
contains a summary of the chiral zero-momentum brst cohomologies at ghost
number zero and one and a brief description of the n =2 ghost system which
plays an important role in all what follows.

2 the n =2 string

the n =2 string has a left- and a right-moving n =2 superconformal algebra as
constraint algebra. the corresponding ghost system (see appendix) has central
charge 6 implying a critical dimension d = 4. the underlying supergravity
theory on the world sheet unfortunately requires the string coordinates to be
complex so the target space is, in fact, two complex dimensional. a free eld
representation of the n =2 currents is

t (z) = 

 z  z

g+(z) =  z  +,

here z a, a = 0, 1 are the complex string coordinates, z a their complex conju-
gates and +a, a the superpartners. 4

4complex conjugation in target space and on the world sheet is denoted by a bar whereas
antiholomorphic operators will be denoted by tilde. for the fermion elds a  index is used
instead of a bar. this has the advantage that the world sheet u (1) charge of any eld equals
half the number of its  indices. the su (1, 1) invariant scalar product is dened through aa
with non-vanishing components 11 = 00 = 1. for example

z   = aaz a  a = z 0  0 + z 1  1.

parts of this notation are taken from [3].

one may check that the currents satisfy the n =2 super virasoro algebra with
central charge c = 6. due to the spectral ow automorphism of this algebra it
is no restriction to consider the ns sector only. furthermore, one can consider
the additional currents

(the antisymmetric  symbol is dened as 01 = 01 = 01 = 01 = 1.)
together with the currents (1) they satisfy the small n = 4 super-conformal
algebra [12]. in particular the j-currents form an ane su (2) algebra:

j(z)j (w)  

j (z)j ++(w)

the only physical state of the theory is the massless ground state. in the
(1, 1) picture the holomorphic part of the corresponding vertex operator is

k  k = 0.

(6)

using picture-changed versions of this operator, it is not hard to calculate the
three-point function a3(ki) = a3(ki)(k1 + k2 + k3) at tree level:

(3)

(4)

(7)

a3(ki) =(cid:0)k1k2  k2k1)2.

all n -point functions with n > 3 vanish at tree level [5, 6]. these amplitudes
are reproduced by a scalar eld (z, z) with equation of motion

aaa a =

1
2

ababa ab b.

(8)

the geometrical meaning of this equation can be understood [1] by considering
the plebanski equation,

ababa ab b = 2,

(9)

which describes the kahler potential (z, z) of a ricci-at kahler metric in
a suitably chosen coordinate system. the eld  parametrises deviations of 
from at space, since inserting the expression

 = aaz a z a + (z, z)

(10)

4

into (9) yields (8). an obvious symmetry of these equations are the usual kahler
transformations.

interestingly the plebanski equation is equivalent to the consistency condi-

tion [l0, l1] = 0 of the linear system [7]

l0 = 0 + w0,

l1 = 1 + w1

with

wa = aba a b

(11)

(12)

and an arbitrary complex parameter . this structure is familiar from the
theory of integrable models and usually leads to a large symmetry which will
be further explored in subsection 4.3. it is the main purpose of this paper to
investigate how these symmetries are realized in the n =2 string.

3 chiral brst cohomology

as has been mentioned in the introduction and will be further explained in
section 4, an important technical tool to study unbroken symmetries in string
theory is the chiral brst cohomology (i.e. the cohomology of only the left-
moving part of the fock space). there exists a powerful method to solve the
cohomology problem for non-zero momentum [15, 16]. the result of this anal-
ysis for the n = 2 string [11] is that the chiral, relative (see below) cohomology
contains precisely one physical state in each picture. this state has ghost num-
ber one, and in the (1, 1) picture it is represented by the vertex operator
(6). unfortuntely, the method of [15, 16] fails for vanishing momentum. this
is unimportant if one is only interested in the spectrum of the theory, since the
behaviour of the dynamical degrees of freedom at isolated points in momentum
space is irrelevant. for the symmetry structure, however, the zero-momentum
cohomology is very important.

we do not know of a systematic method to completely determine the coho-
mology for zero momentum except for explicit computation, which is the subject
of the present chapter. for this the following elementary and well-known ob-
servation is crucial: the spectrum of the zero modes l0 and j0 of the bosonic
currents is discrete so that representatives of non-trivial cohomology classes can
always be chosen to be annihilated by l0 and j0. to prove this one uses the
relations

{q, b0} = l0,

{q, b

0} = j0

(13)

to show that a brst-invariant state with non-vanishing eigenvalue is always
trivial. these relations imply that the space of states involved in the cohomol-
ogy problem can be further constrained by the requirement that all states be
annihilated by b0 and b
0. we therefore need to consider only the relative fock
space frel, dened as

frel :=n|i (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) l0|i = j0|i = b0|i = b

0|i = 0o.

(14)

5

the brst cohomology of this space is called relative cohomology; in this sec-
tion, however, the term relative will be dropped. what happens to the coho-
mology when the b0 and b
0 conditions are relaxed is described in great detail in
section 3 of [13].

moreover, we only need to consider pictures   1. the other half of the
cohomology can be found by poincare duality (see section 3 of [16], for example)
once the rst half is known.

3.1 ghost number zero

let us rst consider the (1, 1) picture. at ghost number5 zero it is simply
impossible to write down a state obeying the conditions in (14). the relative
fock space is empty and so is the cohomology. similarly, one shows that there
is no cohomology at ghost number zero in the (0, 1) and (1, 0) picture.

in the (0, 0) picture the situation is dierent. the relative fock space con-

tains two candidate states at zero ghost number, namely

| 0, 0, k = 0 i

and

c1b

1| 0, 0, k = 0 i.

(15)

the rst of these states is just the sl(2) invariant ground state which is brst
invariant, whereas the second state is not invariant. since the relative fock
space at ghost number 1 is empty in this picture, we need not worry about
the image of q and have thus proven that the ground state (or the unit operator
in the language of vertex operators) spans the ghost number zero cohomology.

it is instructive also to consider the (1, 1) picture. candidate states are

1/2db
da

1/2| 1, 1, k = 0 i,

c1b

1da

1/2db

1/2| 1, 1, k = 0 i,

(16)

where the fourier modes of the matter fermions  appear:

i+a = xrz+1/2

r zr1/2,
d+a

ia = xrz+1/2

r zr1/2.
da

(17)

a small calculation shows that the combination

(1  c1b

1)da

1/2db

1/2| 1, 1, k = 0 i

(18)

is invariant. again there is no state at ghost number 1 so that (18) spans the
cohomology. the corresponding vertex operator is

a(z) := (1  cb)j e+

e

(z).

(19)

in exactly the same way one shows that the cohomology in the (1, 1) picture
is represented by

a(z) := (1 + cb)j ++e+

e

(z).

(20)

5as in [17] ghost number is dened to commute with picture number, see also the appendix.

6

the operators a and a are nothing but spectral ow operators with spectral
parameter 1 and 1. they induce an isomorphism between the cohomologies at
picture (+, ) and (+  1,  + 1). to show this one uses the fact that the
brst cohomology possesses a natural multiplication rule [9]: given two brst
invariant but non-trivial vertex operators o1 and o2, their normal ordered
product

(cid:0)o1  o2(cid:1)(w) =iw

dz
2i

1

z  w

o1(z)o2(w)

(21)

denes a new cohomology class. this product6 has the extremely important
property that on cohomology classes it is graded commutative and associative
[14]. using (5) one nds that the product of a and a is

a  a = 1



a = a1.

(22)

multiplication by a is thus an invertible map between the cohomologies at
(+, ) and (+  1,  + 1) which shows that they are isomorphic. this is
how the spectral ow automorphism of the n =2 super virasoro algebra acts on
its brst cohomology.

let us now turn to the (0, 1) and (1, 0) pictures. what do we expect to nd?
recall that there exist picture-changing operators x . they act on physical
states by the above multiplication rule (21). according to friedan, martinec and
shenker [10] they are constructed rather ingeniously as x  = {q, } which are
non-trivial since the zero modes of  are not part of the theory (bosonization
of the  ghosts involves only ). their explicit form is

x  = c +(cid:0)g  4b  4b  2b(cid:1)e

.

(23)

x + has picture number (1, 0) and x  has (0, 1). the states x (z = 0)|0i are
ordinary cohomology classes with ghost number zero and vanishing momentum.
there exists, however, an alternative way to construct a cohomology class in
the (0, 1) picture, say: just consider the operator y  := a  x + [18]. its explicit
form is

y  =(cid:2)c+e+

+ (1  cb)e+ bg.

 4(1  cb)(b +

b)+e+

1
2

+ 4b+e+(cid:3)j 

(24)

the important observation is that y  is brst inequivalent to x .
if they
were equivalent some linear combination of x  and y  had to be trivial. but
this cannot be the case since one may easily convince oneself that the relative
fock space in the (0, 1) picture at ghost number 1 consists only of the state

6 there is a little problem with this product if one considers general vertex operators with
momentum k, since then the ope between the vertex operators typically contains singularities
of the form (z  w)k1k2 . therefore the product makes sense only between operators whose
momenta are constrained to have integer scalar product. in this paper we only consider the
case where at least one operator involved has zero momentum and so this diculty disappears.

7

1da
b
1/2| 0, 1, k = 0 i. obviously the image of this state under q is not equal
to a linear combination of x (0)|0i and y (0)|0i, which shows that they are
inequivalent. alternatively, one could nd x  and y  by explicitly writing
down a basis of the relative fock space at ghost number zero in this picture and
look for brst-invariant combinations. in this way one can prove that there are
no further cohomology classes in this picture besides x  and y . in complete
analogy one shows that the cohomology in the (1, 0) picture is represented by
x + and y + := x   a1.

it is instructive to work out how these operators act on physical states. let
us start with the vertex operator in the (1, 1) picture, given in (6), and dene
vertex operators in higher pictures as

v+,(k) = (x +)++1  (x )+1  v1,1(k).

(25)

to see what a and a1 do, consider the operators

v1,0(k) = cke
e
v0,1(k) = ck+e+

e

i

2 (k z+kz),
2 (k z+kz).

i

(26)

using the explicit expressions (19) and (20) it is easy to check that

a  v0,1(k) = h(k)v1,0(k),

a1  v1,0(k) = h(k)1v0,1(k)

(27)

with h(k) dened as

h(k) =

k0
k1 =

k1
k0 .

(28)

note that |h| = 1 so that h = 1/h. this particular function of the momenta
features prominently in [6] (see also [19]) and will also be very important in
what follows. in position space h translates into a non-local expression, indicat-
ing that we are on the right track to discover the non-local symmetries of the
plebanski equation on the string theory side. using the commutativity of the
product (21) and the denition (25) one sees that a and a1 act on all higher
vertex operators as in equation (27).

ghost number zero cohomology classes in higher pictures can now be con-
structed by simply considering positive powers of x  and integer powers of a.
for a given picture (+, ) one can write down + +  + 1 operators:

o+,,n := (x +)++n  (x )n  an,

n = +, ..., .

(29)

the range of n  z is restricted because negative powers of x  do not exist.
the operators o+,,n are all non-trivial. to see this assume that some linear
combination of the o+,,n were brst trivial, i.e.

xn

no+,,n = {q, }

(30)

8

for some  and suitably chosen coecients n. then its product with any vertex
operator v (k) necessarily had to be trivial, as well. on the other hand one has,
using (27),

(cid:16)xn

no+,,n(cid:17)  v0,0(k) =(cid:16)xn

nh(k)n(cid:17)v+,(k).

(31)

the right hand side can only be brst trivial if the sum pn nh(k)n vanishes

for any momentum k with kk = 0. this can certainly not be the case, which
proves that any of the operators in (29) represents a distinct cohomology class.
this does not prove, however, that the operators (29) span the full cohomology.
it may well be that there exist additional cohomology classes that cannot be
constructed this way.

in order to summarize the above ndings let us introduce the notation  =
+ + . then the following facts about the ghost number zero cohomologies
at vanishing momentum hold:

 the cohomologies at picture (+, ) and (b+,b) are isomorphic if  = b

(this is just the spectral ow automorphism and is also true for other ghost
numbers and any momentum).

 there is no cohomology for  = 2 or  = 1.

 there is one cohomology class for  = 0. for (+, ) = (n, n) this

class is represented by the operator an.

 there are two classes for  = 1. for (+, ) = (1  n, n) they are

represented by x +  an and x   an1.

 for  > 1 the cohomology contains the states of (29). all these states
represent distinct cohomology classes but may not exhaust the full coho-
mology.

analogous statements for  < 1 can be obtained by poincare duality.

3.2 ghost number one

the zero momentum cohomology at ghost number one contains one state in the
(1, 1) picture and two states in the (1, 0) and (0, 1) pictures respectively
[11]. in this paper, however, we are mainly interested in the case   0. in
the (0, 0) picture, the cohomology at ghost number one is spanned by the four
operators [20]

ip a

0,0 = cz a  2+a,

i p a

0,0 = c z a  2+a.

(32)

multiplication with the operators of equation (29) yields new cohomology

classes in higher pictures,

+,,n := o+,,n  p a
p a
0,0,
p a
+,,n := o+,,n  p a
0,0.

(33)

9

for a given picture (+, ) these are 4( + 1) states. to show that they all
represent dierent cohomology classes we need the so-called bracket operation
[14], dened as

with

{o1, o2}(w) :=iw

dz
2i

o(1)

1 (z)o2(w)

o(1)(w) :=iw

dz
2i

b(z)o(w).

(34)

(35)

o1 and o2 are arbitrary operators and b is the anti-ghost eld. in [14] it has been
shown that on cohomology classes the bracket operation is graded commutative
although the operators o1 and o2 enter quite dierently into the denition (34).
moreover, it acts as a graded derivation on the normal ordered product in the
cohomology:

{o1, o2  o3} = {o1, o2}  o3 + ()(|o1|1)|o2|o2  {o1, o3}.

(36)

as usual, the symbol |o| is zero if o is a bosonic operator and one if it is
fermionic. the brst cohomology together with the normal ordered product
and the bracket operation has been called gerstenhaber algebra in [14] where
more details and references to the original work of gerstenhaber can be found.
obviously the bracket carries ghost number 1, so it is the appropriate opera-
tion for the ghost number one states (33) to dene an operator map within each
sector of xed ghost number. the operators in (32) act on the physical vertex
operators as momentum operators,

{p a
{ p a

0,0, v+,(k)} = kav+,(k),
0,0, v+,(k)} = kav+,(k).

(37)

this can easily be shown by performing the computation explicitly in the
(1, 1) picture and then using equations (25), (36) and the relations

{p a

0,0, x } = {p a

0,0, a} = { p a

0,0, x } = { p a

0,0, a} = 0,

(38)

which obviously hold since x  and a are operators with vanishing momentum.
similarly, one shows that

{p a
{ p a

+,,n, vb+,b(k)} = h(k)nkav++b+,+b(k),
+,,n, vb+,b(k)} = h(k)nkav++b+,+b(k).

(39)

with the same argument that established the brst inequivalence of the oper-
ators in equation (29) one now proves that the operators in (33) all represent
distinct cohomology classes. but, as in the ghost number zero case, there may
well be more cohomology in higher pictures.

10

3.3 ghost number two and higher

there are plenty of cohomology classes at arbitrarily high ghost number when
+ +   1. they can be obtained by acting with x  and a on the states
an , bn and cn of equation (15) in [11], but their role within the symmetry
structure of the theory is not clear to us.

4 symmetries

we can now use the results of the previous section to study the symmetries
of the n =2 string. the machinery to systematically analyse symmetries and
ward identities of a theory  once its brst cohomology is known  has been
developed in the context of 2d string theory. for completeness we briey review
some of the material following [13].

4.1 some generalities

a current with components jz and jz in a two dimensional theory (complex
coordinates z and z) is conserved, i.e. satises jz + jz = 0, when the one-
form

is closed. the corresponding charge

(1) = jzdz  jzdz

a =ic

(1)

(40)

is conserved if it has the same value for contours c and c that are homologous,
i.e. are the boundaries of some surface m , m = c  c. current conservation
implies charge conservation by stokes theorem.

in brst quantisation these relations are required to hold only up to brst

commutators. current conservation then reads7

for some two form (2) = (2)
z z dz  dz. brst invariance of the charge requires
[q, (1)] = d(0). applying q to this relation implies that [q, (0)] is a
constant. furthermore, this constant must vanish, since otherwise the unit
operator were brst trivial. summarising, we have the descent equations

(42)

(43)

d(1) =(cid:2)q, (2)(cid:3)

(cid:2)q, (0)(cid:3) = 0,
(cid:2)q, (1)(cid:3) = d(0),
(cid:2)q, (2)(cid:3) = d(1).

11

7 depending on whether two operators are both fermionic or not, one must consider their
anti-commutator or commutator. in this section we generally denote this by [, ]. it should
always be clear from the context which is meant. we use this notation in order to avoid
confusion with the gerstenhaber bracket which, strictly speaking, is not an anticommutator.

moreover, the whole formalism is unaected by the replacements

(0)  (0) +(cid:2)q, (cid:3),

(1)  (1) + d,

(44)

where  is some form of degree zero. the equations for (0) are precisely the
dening relations for the brst cohomology. taking as (0) some cohomology
class of ghost number g one can then construct the forms (1) and (2) of ghost
numbers g  1 and g  2. it is most natural to choose (0) to have ghost number
one. this results in a charge of ghost number zero that can map physical states
to physical states. in principle one could also consider charges of dierent ghost
number (see [21] for a discussion), but they would annihilate the physical states.
the fact that symmetries sit at ghost number one can also be seen in a
string eld approach, in which the equation of brst invariance q|i = 0
can be regarded as the linearized equation of motion for the string eld |i.
schematically, gauge symmetries have the form

|i = q|i + |  i + higher order terms.

(45)

since the string eld has ghost number two (it contains the physical states)
the symmetry parameter |i has ghost number one. if |i is not killed by q
we have a gauge symmetry that starts with a eld-independent term. such a
symmetry can often be used to simply gauge away some elds (see section 4 of
[22]). it is not an unbroken symmetry of the chosen background. moreover, a
brst-trivial parameter |i = q|i leads to a trivial symmetry that cannot be
used to derive conserved currents. we thus see again that ghost number one
cohomology is the right tool for studying symmetries in string theory8.

as a simple example let us consider target space translations in bosonic
string theory. the only ghost number zero chiral cohomology class is the unit
operator, which we may take as the right-moving piece of the closed string
cohomology. as left-moving piece we must take a ghost number one state that
also has vanishing momentum  the only candidate is cx . the forms (i)
take the form (suppressing the right-moving unit operator)

(0) = cx ,

(1) = x dz,

(2) = 0.

(46)

the charge is just the center-of-mass momentum operator p  =h dz

2 x .

4.2 transformation laws of physical states

in this section the formalism just described will be applied to the n =2 string.
to construct the symmetry charges we rst have to specify the ghost number
one cohomology classes (0) of the closed strings. without loss of generality

8we have neglected the eects of the anti-ghost zero modes here. taking them into account
properly leads the semi-relative cohomology. we leave it to future work to do this for the n =2
string.

12

one can take a chiral cohomology class of ghost number one as left-mover and
one of ghost number zero as right-mover (denoted by ). exchanging left- and
right-movers does not lead to anything new. moreover left- and right-movers
are chosen to have the same picture number. using the expressions in equations
(29) and (33) leads to

a(0)
+,,m,n = p a

+,,m(z) o+,,n(z),

m, n = +, ..., .

(47)

an analogous zero form can be constructed from p a. (1) and (2) can be
found using the fact that, given a chiral cohomology class v , the current v (1)
dened as in equation (35) brst-transforms into the derivative of v ,

it is then not hard to check that (0) together with9

(cid:2)q, v (1)(cid:3) = v.

culation can be done by rewriting the contour integrals in terms of the product
(21) and the gerstenhaber bracket (34) 10.

tion of equation (5.19) in [13].

13

the term in the fourth line is known from section 3 and the last term van-
ishes because of ghost number counting. to see this consider the expression

p+,,m  vb+,b(k)(w) which is an operator with momentum k 6= 0 and ghost

number two. however, from the general analysis [11] it is known that there is
no chiral cohomology at this ghost number. we thus proved that this operator
must be brst trivial. the nal result then reads

a

4.3 symmetries of the plebanski equation

in order to propose a possible interpretation of the transformations (54), we
study in this subsection the symmetries of the plebanski equations (8) and (9),
hoping to nd something resembling (54). the symmetry structure of self-
dual gravity has been intensively investigated (see [7] for further references)
and can be described in a precise and mathematically rigorous way in terms
of twistor theory. however, this formalism is unnecessarily abstract for our
purposes, and we prefer a more pedestrian but explicit approach. so instead of
trying to describe the symmetries in full generality we only work out specic
transformation laws, keeping in mind that they are part of a deep underlying
mathematical structure.

recall that the plebanski equation

ababa a b b = 2

(55)

describes a ricci-at kahler potential in a specic coordinate system. it is only
invariant under antiholomorphic (or holomorphic) coordinate transformations
generated by divergence-free vector elds with components va = va( z). 
transforms as a scalar,

 = va a with ava = 0.

(56)

however, the plebanski equation possesses more symmetries. consider a vector
eld a(z, z) a that still has vanishing divergence but can depend on both z
and z. then (55) is invariant under a transformation  satisfying

to check this statement we compute

a = c ca.

ababa a b b = abab a(cid:0)c ca(cid:1) b b
= abab ac ca b b +

1
2

c c(cid:0)ababa a b b(cid:1) = 0.

(57)

(58)

the rst term in the second line vanishes since ab ac is symmetric in b  c and
the second term vanishes due to the equation of motion. for antiholomorphic

14

components a( z) the transformation (57) reduces to (56) and corresponds to
a dieomorphism. if however, the functions a also depend on the holomorphic
coordinates, i.e. ba 6= 0, the transformation (57) should not be thought of as
due to a coordinate change of the underlying complex manifold. it has no direct
connection to dieomorphisms.

of course, this is not the full story. (57) is a dierential equation for 
which has a solution only if the right hand side obeys the consistency condition

0 = abab = abac cb.

(59)

an innite set of solutions c
let us assume there is a solution c
as

n, n = 0, 1, 2, . . . can be found iteratively as follows.

is a new one. to complete the iterative description we have to provide a vector
a, which we take to be purely antiholomorphic, i.e. aa
eld a
0 = 0. this
0
evidently satises (59). the transformations generated by the a
n via (57) are
denoted by n in the following. then only 0 is a gauge symmetry as in (56),
while the other transformations are of the type (57). it is important to note
that the determination of the a
n according to (60) involves integrating the right
hand side. thus n is in general a non-local symmetry 11.

as already mentioned in section two, in order to compare the results of this
section to the n =2 string we need to reformulate the symmetry structure in
terms of the eld , dened as

(z, z) = aaz a z a + (z, z).

(61)

 describes deviations of the kahler potential from at space. for convenience
we recall its equation of motion

aaa a =

the transformations n read in terms of :

an = c

and one may check that they leave (62) invariant. moreover, (60) becomes

11the iterative construction just described is in fact well known from the theory of integrable
models in two dimensions. to see this rewrite the plebanski equation as [w0, w1] = 0 with
wa from (12). moreover, wa satises abawb = 0. these two equations are the equations
of a two dimensional model derived from a wess-zumino action [23]. such models are known
to possess an innite set of non-local symmetries that are constructed as above [24].

in general these are inhomogeneous transformations, containing -independent
terms. they are spontaneously broken by our choice of ground state  = 0 which
corresponds to a at background. we cannot expect to see this kind of symmetry
in rst-quantised string theory since there all symmetries are connected to brst
invariant operators. the latter can only generate unbroken symmetries, that do
not contain eld-independent terms, as is clear from the discussion at the end of
subsection 4.1. yet if we take c
0 to be constant, i.e. consider global translations
in the z coordinates, it turns out that the truncated transformation

0 = c
0

c

(66)

still is a symmetry of the plebanski equation since 0 and 0 dier by a kahler
transformation. moreover, in c

(67)

1 contains a linear and a non-linear term. but the best we can do is to com-
pare the string transformations (54) to the linearised symmetries of the eld .
we therefore focus in the following on the linear part of the non-local trans-
formations n. let us rst note that the iterative construction (64) does not
create -independent terms in any c
0. this leads to
the very important conclusion that the corresponding transformations n (one
might call them anisations of translations) are unbroken symmetries. more-
over, working to lowest order in  we may drop the second term on the right
hand side of (63). dierentiating this equation n  1 times leads to

n derived from a constant c

a1 . . . an n = a1 . . . an1(an cc

n) + o(2).

repeated application of (64) and again dropping non-linear terms gives

a1 . . . an n = a1

prefactor i

of equations (54) and (72) in section six12.

2 ccc

let us nally add that the unbroken linearised symmetries of equation (62)
can be derived more quickly in the following fashion. to nd the linear part of
a transformation  one may simply drop the right hand side of (62) and study
the equation

(74)

which again leads to (69). thus, nding the linearised symmetries amounts
to the simple task of solving (73), e.g. by fourier transformation. moreover,
we see that dierent pictures correspond to dierent solutions of (73). we
have nevertheless prefered to investigate the exact symmetries of the plebanski
equation in some more detail in this section, hoping to better understand its
connection to the n =2 string.

5 ward identities

symmetries in string and eld theories manifest themselves in relations between
correlation functions, known as ward identities, which can be extremely useful
either for studying general properties of the theory or for explicitly guring
out physically interesting quantities. therefore, the ward identities following
from the symmetries uncovered in the previous section will now be investigated.
before turning to the n =2 string, however, the rst subsection will briey
review the general formalism following [13], [25] and [21].

5.1 more generalities

for simplicity we restrict ourselves to lowest order (genus zero and no u (1)
instantons) in string perturbation theory in this paper, but higher orders can be
treated in a similar way. moreover, in this subsection we consider bosonic string
theory, in which perturbative evaluation of correlation functions involves only
integration over metric moduli. we defer to the next subsection the discussion

12 one may also compare this to equation (4.1) from [6].

17

of how the more complicated perturbative structure of the n =2 string aects
the derivation of ward identities.

in the operator formalism a correlation function

 =(cid:10)v1 . . . vn +1(cid:11)

(75)

as a dierential form of degree pn +1
pn +1

of n + 1 brst invariant operators vi with ghost numbers gi can be regarded
i=1 gi  6 on the moduli space mn +1 of
the sphere with n + 1 marked points (which is just the conguration space of
n  2 distinct points on the sphere). this can be understood heuristically since
i=1 gi  6 is the number of anti-ghost insertions and therefore of integrations
needed to obtain a number from . moreover, it is an important general result
that this form is closed. for scattering amplitudes one takes each of the vi to
have ghost number two. then  is a top form and can be integrated over the
full moduli space to produce a number  the scattering amplitude. to derive a
ward identity for the n -point function one takes n physical vertex operators
vi plus one ghost number one operator that is connected to the symmetries of
the theory. then  is a form of codimension one and can only be integrated
over a submanifold of mn +1 of codimension one. the natural candidate is
the boundary mn +1. because of d = 0 and stokes theorem this integral
vanishes, so the ward identity reads

zmn +1

 =zmn +1

d = 0.

(76)

the boundary of the moduli space of a sphere with n + 1 marked points corre-
sponds to congurations where the sphere splits into two spheres (one containing
n + 1  p and the other p of the points for some 2  p  n  1) connected
by an innitely long tube. this tube can be represented by a complete set of
physical states propagating between the spheres. the twist angle of the tube
is one of the moduli leading to an insertion of b(z)  b(z). the complete set of
states therefore takes the form

where i labels a basis of the absolute brst cohomology and

xi

|boiihoi|,
|boii = (b0  b0)|oii.

hoj |oii = i
j,

(77)

(78)

(79)

the ward identity for a correlation function involving n ghost number two
vertex operators vi := v (ki, zi, zi) and one ghost number one operator (0)
thus reads:

xi, (cid:10)(cid:10)vu1 . . . vup (0)boi(cid:11)(cid:11)(cid:10)(cid:10)oivup+1 . . . vun(cid:11)(cid:11) = 0.

the sum over  runs over all possible ways to divide the n physical vertex
operators into a subset {vu1 . . . vup } on the sphere of (0) and the remainder
{vup+1 . . . vun } located on the other sphere. moreover, we have adopted the
notation from [13] and indicate by a double bracket that the integration over
moduli space has already been performed.

18

5.2 ward identities of the n =2 string

before trying to apply the ward identity (79) let us briey comment on the
moduli of the n =2 string at tree level and zero u (1) instanton number. the
integration over the fermionic moduli can be explictly performed, resulting in
the prescription that the picture numbers + = + and  =  of the vertex
operators both have to add up to 2 in order to get a non-vanishing correlator.
the u (1) moduli enter via the homology of the punctured riemann surface. at
genus zero they simply correspond to the non-trivial monodromies of the u (1)
charged elds around the punctures. however, spectral ow identies the corre-
lators for dierent monodromies and we can restrict ourselves to the ns sector
at each puncture. the integration over the u (1) moduli merely contributes to
the normalisation. moreover, the u (1) moduli space has no boundaries. it can
play no role in this subsection as one sees from the way the ward identity has
been derived above. we will therefore not write down the u (1) ghosts explicitly.
let us now consider the ward identities involving the ghost number one
states (47) and suppress the picture numbers for notational simplicity. for the
case of the three-point function involving three closed-string vertex operators
vi(ki) with lightlike momenta k1 + k2 + k3 = 0 the identity (79) becomes13

xi (cid:10)v1a(0)
+xi (cid:10)v3a(0)

m,nboi(cid:11)(cid:10)oiv2v3(cid:11) +xi (cid:10)v2a(0)
m,nboi(cid:11)(cid:10)oiv1v2(cid:11) = 0.

m,nboi(cid:11)(cid:10)oiv3v1(cid:11)

(80)

are uniquely xed. for example, the only operator that contributes in the rst

the picture and ghost numbers and the momenta of the operators oi and boi
sum is oi = v1 with conjugate states oi = c cv1 and boi = (c + c)v1. the

second factor in the rst term is simply the ordinary three-point function a3,
while the rst factor splits into holomorphic and antiholomorphic parts

(cid:10)v1(k1)a(0)
=(cid:10)v1(k1)p a

m,n(c + c)v1(k1)(cid:11)
mv1(k1)(cid:11)l(cid:10) v1(k1) on c v1(k1)(cid:11)r.

(81)

the subscripts l and r indicate that the two correlators are meant with respect
to the chiral left- and right-moving theories (the term cv1 does not contribute
because of ghost number counting). note that the whole discussion does not
depend on the pictures chosen, so that there is no restriction on the values of m
and n. the correlators in (81) can be evaluated using the relations from section
3 and then yield ka
1 h(k1)m+n. the explicit ward identity for the three-point
function nally takes the form

a3

3xi=1

i h(ki)m = 0
ka

(82)

13for the three-point function on the sphere there is no dierence between single or double

brackets since the corresponding moduli space consists of a single point.

19

for any m  z. an analogous relation holds with ka
i . the
amplitude can be non-zero only if the sum above vanishes for all m. the unique
solution is

i replaced by ka

h(k1) = h(k2) = h(k3).

(83)

this exactly coincides with the result of berkovits and vafa in [6] to which we
refer for further discussion.

next, we discuss the ward identities for general n -point functions involving
n lightlike momenta ki with k1 + k2 + . . . + kn = 0. the  sum in (79) now
runs over a large number of possible degenerations of the riemann surface.
in particular, in the splitting the ghost number zero operator (0) may be
accompanied by more than one vertex operator, leading to a correlator

(cid:10)(cid:10)vu1 vu2 . . . vupa(0)

m,nboi(cid:11)(cid:11)(cid:10)(cid:10)oivup+1 . . . vun(cid:11)(cid:11).

(84)

oi has momentum ku1 + ku2 + . . . + kup and is generally not an on-shell ver-
tex operator. the standard way to deal with this situation is to invoke the
canceled propagator argument: evaluate the above expression in a kinematical
region where the intermediate states have positive scaling dimension. the con-
tributions from the boundary of moduli space vanish in this case. by virtue of
analytic continuation the correlator must then also vanish in other regions of
momentum space. however, if (0) splits o with only one vertex operator vi
the canceled propagator argument does not apply since the intermediate state
in this situation has momentum ki and is always on-shell. the ward iden-
tity therefore receives contributions only from this type of degeneration of the
riemann surface and reads

nxi=1

hv (ki)a(0)

m,nbv (ki)(cid:11)an = an

nxi=1

ka
i h(ki)m+n = 0

(85)

which holds for any m + n  z. it does not look very exciting (after all, it stems
from anisations of translations) but implies that an (k) vanishes unless

nxi=1

ka
i h(ki)m = 0

for any m  z.

(86)

to study the solutions of this equation it is useful to recall that h is only a phase
and can be rewritten as h(ki) = eii. dividing (86) by h(k1)m and summing
over m leads to 14

0 =

nxi=1

ka

i xmz

eim(i1) =

nxi=1

ka
i (i  1).

(87)

14we are grateful to helge dennhardt for this suggestion.

20

the rst term, i = 1, in the sum is non-vanishing. without loss of generality
we can neglect kinematical situations where a true subset of the momenta sums
to zero, so the only possibility for (87) to hold is

1 = 2 . . . = n .

(88)

then (87) is satised because of momentum conservation. the ward identity
(86) therefore leads to the nal conclusion that the n -point function vanishes
unless

h(k1) = h(k2) = . . . = h(kn )

(89)

which implies that all scalar products kikj + kj ki are zero and exactly repro-
duces the general vanishing theorem for tree-level amplitudes of [6].

in the discussion above we neglected special kinematical situations and in-
voked analytic continuation. in a realistic theory this would certainly be jus-
tied. whether or not one should require on-shell correlation functions to be
analytic in a spacetime of signature (2, 2) depends on ones interpretation. for
example, parkes argues in [19] that -function contributions to the s-matrix of
the n =2 string are important with respect to the role of self-dual gravity and
n =2 string theory in the theory of integrable models. clearly, such subtleties
are not accessible by the above methods.

6 concluding remarks

the purpose of this paper is to provide evidence for our belief that the non-
trivial picture structure of the brst cohomology is not just an irrelevant detail
of the brst approach but important for a deeper understanding of the theory
(see [12] for similar remarks). the key points are:

 the symmetry transformation (54) of the rst-quantised string theory
coincides with the symmetry transformation (72) of the eld theory at the
linearised level.

 the ward identity (86) correctly implies the vanishing of all correlation
functions with more than three external legs, at least for generic values of
the momenta.

the rst point deserves further discussion. it is, of course, not a simple task
to discover the full symmetry group of a string model. doing so would roughly
correspond to having found a useful non-perturbative denition of the theory.
in this paper we have worked in the standard rst-quantised formalism. to
see how much insight into the symmetry structure one may gain within such
an approach, it is instructive to recall the situation in closed bosonic string
theory. the latter includes gravity and should therefore be a theory invariant
under general coordinate transformations. the standard perturbative expan-
sion, however, is around at space which breaks the symmetry down to the

21

poincare group. the zero momentum cohomology at ghost number one con-
tains only translations (see (46)). one can certainly write down currents that
generate lorentz transformations,

j  = x x   x x ,

(90)

but they do not show up in the cohomology since x  is not a legal operator that
takes part in the operator-state correspondence of the conformal eld theory.

equivalently, the eld  that encodes the degrees of freedom of the n =2
string describes deviations from the kahler potential of at space. hence we
nd translations in the (0, 0) picture (see (32)). this is the most natural picture
in the sense that it is the only one where currents derived from cohomology
classes do not contain contributions from the ghost sector. they can thus be
integrated over the world sheet to generate deformations of the conformal eld
theory.

we have seen in subsection 4.3 that the non-local transformations derived
from translations also leave the at metric invariant. we should therefore nd
them somewhere in the zero momentum cohomology of the n =2 string. the
similarity between equations (54) and (72) suggests that they show up via the
picture dependence of the zero momentum brst cohomology, but it is needless
to say that at the moment this is just a tentative statement. there are further
unbroken symmetries in the eld theory. one can check, for example, that the
0 = z c, is free of eld-
non-local transformation 2 derived from a rotation, i.e. c
independent parts. however, the target space coordinates appear explicitly in
the transformation law, and we should not expect to nd a counterpart in the
cohomology  just as explained above in the context of bosonic string theory.

one further aspect should be mentioned. the transformations n are gauge
symmetries only for n = 0. on the other hand, it is a general theorem that
string theory does not admit continuous rigid symmetries in target space (see
chapter 18 of [26]). the proof of this statement is based on the fact that for any
such symmetry there are associated conserved currents on the world-sheet from
which one can construct vertex operators for gauge bosons. one may therefore
wonder how the unbroken non-local symmetries can be realised in n =2 string
theory. the point is that the above theorem typically assumes that the world-
sheet currents are chirally conserved, which is not always true. one counter
example are the currents (90) of lorentz transformations (string theory gauges
only translations, [27]). in the case of the n = 2 string the currents associated
to the symmetry charges are given in (49). they are chirally conserved only
for (+, ) = (0, 0) since then the right moving part is just the unit operator.
the corresponding gauge boson is the plebanski eld . for other values of
(+, ) with m = n = 0 in (49) the currents are not chirally conserved but
nevertheless give rise to gauge bosons which are picture changed versions of the
(0, 0) vertex operator. for non-zero values of m and n, however, the currents do
not allow one to construct a gauge boson vertex operator, which explains why
they correspond only to global symmetries in target space.

it is also interesting to note the similarity between the n =2 string and 2d
strings: both theories have the same spectrum (one scalar) and possess a ring

22

of ghost number zero states. this leads in both cases to an innite dimensional
symmetry which completely xes the dynamics. the ground ring elements of
the 2d theory are labelled by quantised values of the momenta. on physical
vertex operators (tachyons) they act by muliplication of a momentum dependent
function and by a shift of the momenta. this is completely analogous to the
relation

o+,,n  vb+,b(k) = h(k)nv++b+,+b (k),

which suggests that the elds  appearing in the bosonisation of the spinor
ghosts play a role similar to the liouville eld in two dimensions. both are scalar
elds coupled to a background charge, and their momenta are quantized. for the
n =2 string this suggests the appearance of an additional complex dimension.
such extra dimensions in connection with the ,  ghost system have also been
proposed in [28].

finally, it would be interesting to nd further examples in which the picture
structure yields non-trivial information about a theory.
in [12] the picture
dependence of the relative zero-momentum cohomology of the ramond sector of
the n =1 string in at space has been discussed. using the picture independence
of the absolute cohomology it is, however, not hard to show that no new ghost
number zero cohomology classes appear in higher pictures (we have checked this
for the 1/2 and 3/2 picture, and it seems unlikely that new states appear at
still higher pictures). to nd such a phenomenon in a 10d superstring theory
it is certainly necessary to consider non-trivial backgrounds. for example, in
[29] an investigation of string propagation on a manifold that includes ads3 has
been initiated. because of the recently proposed cf t /ads correspondence an
innite symmetry is expected in this type of theory, which might possibly show
up in some cases through a picture dependence of the brst cohomology.

b the ghost system

only the currents in (1) arise as constraints from gauge-xing the n =2 su-
pergravity theory on the world-sheet. they have to be used to construct the
chiral brst operator. we furthermore need the standard b,c ghosts of weight
(2, 1), spinor ghosts ,  of weight (3/2, 1/2) and u (1) ghosts b, c of
weight (1, 0). their mode expansions and commutation relations are standard
(the spinor ghosts are half-integer moded since we work in the ns sector). the
ground state | +,  i with picture number (+, ) is dened by dividing the
spinor ghost modes into annihilators and creators:


r | +,  i = 0 when r

r | +,  i = 0 when r   +

 and  are fermionic elds with weight 1 and 0 respectively and ope
(z)(w)  (z  w)1.  are bosonic scalars that couple to a background
charge. their ope is (z)(w)   ln(z  w). with these variables the
state | +,  i can be created from the sl(2) invariant ground state |0i as

| +,  i = e+++

(0)|0i.

as in [17] we dene the ghost number current in a slightly unusual way as

jgh = bc  bc + + + +.

this assigns the correct ghost number to all ghost elds, but commutes with
the operators x  and a dened in section 3. moreover, all states | +,  i
have zero ghost number.

the chiral brst operator q = qmat + qgh splits into two pieces:

normal ordering is dened with respect to the sl(2) invariant ground state, i.e.
the spinor ghosts are normal ordered with respect to the (0, 0) picture. the

ghost parts of the super virasoro generators can be obtained by anticommuting
q with the anti-ghost modes. the explicit expressions for lgh
