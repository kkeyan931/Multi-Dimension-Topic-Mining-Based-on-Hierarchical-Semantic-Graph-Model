(20) (21) formal solution (2) square integrable and, therefore, acceptable zero mode. however, ansatz third power u, (3) = gu 30 = g (1 + r2) 0 3 2 leads square integrable zero mode, (3) = 8 (1+r2)2 8 1+r2 e (1 + r2) 5 2 0 4 (22) (23) i/(3) = 9r4 14r2 + 9 (1 + r2)3 (3). (24) zero modes higher powers u n (n = 4, 5, . . .) u may computed analogous fashion, one nds odd powers u exist square integrable zero modes, whereas even powers formal solutions square integrable. may lead conjecture general property, i.e., odd powers u (17) always lead square integrable zero modes, whereas even powers not. next scetion show indeed case. further, one might speculate dierent behaviour related dierent geo- metrical topological properties even odd powers u. so, let us briey discuss geometry matrices u n. rst power u = (1 + r2) 1 2 (1 + ir~n~) nj = xj r , ~n2 = 1 following properties u(r = 0) = 1 , u(r = ) = i~n~, (25) (26) (27) i.e., behaves similarly su(2) monopole tends hedgehog shape i~n~ r (actually hedgehog corresponds identity map s2(r = ) s2(unit vector ~n) winding number 1). matrix u 2 u 2 = (1 + r2)1 properties u 2(r = 0) = 1 , u 2(r = 1) = i~n~ , u 2(r = ) = 1 (28) (29) i.e., dened r3 compactied s3 (actually, corresponds map s3 s3 winding number 1), and, therefore, similar skyrmion. addition, equal hedgehog sphere radius 1. higher powers u pattern repeats itself. limr u n = (i~n~)n, odd powers u tend hedgehog i~n~ r , i.e., monopole type. even powers tend 1, i.e., skyrmion type. 3 general class solutions want study class su(2) matrices, want show that, depending imposed integrability conditions (see below), su(2) matrices provide zero modes precisely monopole type (i.e., tend hedgehog conguration r ). purpose use parametrization su(2) matrices 5 used  discussion skyrmions. use ansatz class su(2) matrices u (in polar coordinates r, , ) u = exp(if (r)~n(, )~). (30) prole function f depends r, unit vector ~n depends , . therefore, ~n denes map s2 s2 integer winding number. via stereographic projection, coordinate two-sphere (, ) may mapped onto complex plane c coordinate z. explicitly, map z = tan(/2)ei. new coordinate, class unit vectors ~n(, ) may expressed rational maps z r(z) = p(z) q(z) , p, q co-prime polynomials, degree map (the degree p q, whichever higher) equals winding number map (, ) ~n(, ). explicitly, ~n(r(z)) ~n(r(z)) = 1 1 + |r|2 2rer(z) 2imr(z) 1 |r(z)|2 . (31) ~n(z) = 1 sequel restrict simplest rational map r(z) = z (the identity map s2 s2) 1 + |z|2 ansatz (30) u assume, without restriction, f (0) = 0, i.e., u(r = 0) = 1. f () = 2k 2 , k z corresponds skyrmion-type su(2) eld baryon number (i.e., s3 s3 winding number) k. further, f () = (2k + 1) corresponds monopole-type su(2) eld. 2rez 2imz 1 |z|2 sin cos sin sin = . x1 x2 x3 1 r = cos (32) 2 therefore, want prove ansatz = g(r) exp(if (r)~n(z)~)0 = g(r)0 =: 0 (33) c(r) := g(r) cos f (r) , s(r) := g(r) sin f (r) (34) may provide square integrable zero modes type i/ = h(r) monopole-type u skyrmion-type u. remark: continuing, want point examples section 2 belong ansatz (33) (with ~n given (32)). indeed, examples (e.g., (7), (17)) may written like = (a(r)1 + b(r)x)0, a(r), b(r) rational functions (for (17) true x2 = r21). using x = ir~n~, equal ansatz (33) a(r) = c(r), rb(r) = s(r). further, higher powers u k su(2) matrix u (as used (17)) type (30) u is, u k = exp(ikf (r)~n(z)~). i.e., u k computed substituting kf (r) instead f (r) prole function (30). 6 simplify computation, use fact matrix u acts spinor 0 = (1, 0)t, i.e., components u actually occur . best achieved introducing matrices p0 = p1 = 1 2 1 2 (1 + 3) = 1 0 (1 i2) = 0 0 0 0 ! , p0 1 1 0 ! , p1 1 0 ! 0 ! = 1 0 ! = 0 1 ! 1p0 = p1 , 1p1 = p0 , 2p0 = ip1 , 2p1 = ip0 , 3p0 = p0 3p1 = p1 spinor (33) may rewritten like = 0 n+ = n1 + in2 , x+ = x1 + ix2 , + = 1 2 (1 i2). acting i/ gives (35) (36) (37) i/ = p00 + p10.

(44) (45) (46) (47) (48) (49) concerning behaviour r , want discuss two conditions separately. stronger condition, require chernsimons action shall nite (i.e., chernsimons density integrable), addition square integrability magnetic eld zero mode. explicitly, chernsimons density ansatz (33) is, computation (we use notation dierential forms here, i.e., = aidxi, etc.) ada = 2h2 1 + t2 ( r (1 + n2 3) + tn+n)r2dr 4 (1 + a2)2 da := zz , sin = 4 (1 + a2)2 da z ada = 4(2 4)z 0 dr rh2t 1 + t2 + 4(2 + 8)z 0 dr r2h2t 1 + t2 (50) (51) (52) h given (46). integrability ada requires 6= 0, may checked easily. addition, square integrability g (i.e., zero mode) requires 0 and, therefore, end condition > 0. (53) next, relate asymptotic behaviour properties matrix u, (30). illustrative purposes, let us rst explicit example (22) (the third power u 3 specic simplest matrix u, (16)). nd t(r) = tan f (r) = r(3 r2) 1 3r2 8 (54) therefore tan f (0) = 0 . . . f (0) = 0 , tan f ( 1 3 ) = . . . f ( 1 3 ) = 2 tan f (3) = 0 f (3) = , . . . tan f () = . . . f () = 3 2 showing topological number n := (f () f (0)) 2 = 3 (55) (56) odd integer case, and, therefore, corresponding su(2) matrix monopole type. consideration may immediately generalized general behaviour (49), (53). (49) follows t(0) = tan f (0) = 0 . . . f (0) = 0. (53) conclude t() = tan f () = . . . f () = (2k + 1) 2 , k z (57) (58) showing square integrable zero modes odd topological number n = 2k+1 are, therefore, monopole type, additional condition nite chernsimons action imposed. hand, < 0 (leading non-square integrable zero mode), t() = tan f () = 0 . . . f () = 2k 2 , k z. (59) therefore, skyrmion-type su(2) matrices even topological number lead non- square integrable, formal solutions pauli equation. wanted prove. want impose weaker condition magnetic eld ~b square integrable. give condition all. further, square integrability g requires 0, already discussed case > 0. let us investigate case (60) = 0 , t() = = const. little bit closer. square integrability g requires 2 t2 1 + t2 > 3 2 t2 > 3 f ( 3 + k, 2 3 + k) , k z. (61) 9 therefore, broader class zero modes allowed, su(2) matrix u, (30), may tend mixture monopole skyrmion r , u(r = ) cos f1 + sin fi~n~ , sin2 f > 3 cos2 f.

(71) again, discuss condition nite chernsimons action rst. there, conditions remain same, (49), (53). further, g behaves like lim r0 g(r) rl , lim r g(r) rl2 (72) rst condition usual angular momentum barrier. square integrability magnetic eld required, = 0, t() = possible, nd condition square integrability g t2 > 3 + 2l 1 + 2l . (73) 5 summary whole class zero modes (ansatz (33) condition (47)) shown existence related topological quantization condition (the topological number (63) odd integer) precisely additional requirement nite chernsimons action corresponding gauge eld (85) imposed (geometrically, topological quantization condition implies associated su(2) matrix (30) monopole type). result clearly points towards topological origin whole problem, may also interest chernsimons qft. construction seems related existence square inte- grable zero mode topological property zero mode (i.e., su(2) matrix u) rather gauge eld. necessarily true, however. remember zero modes (33) specic type = gu0 , i/ = h , ai = h 2 tr u iu3 (74) i.e., ai related matrix u simple algebraic manner. true even scalar function h, determined algebraically (and t) depend g, see (46). therefore, su(2) matrix u ansatz (30) uniquely determines gauge eld ai via (46), (85), may well ultimately topology ai determines existence zero modes. still, remain many open questions. e.g., ansatz (33) (or (67)) provides one zero mode per gauge eld, would interesting nd examples one zero mode (if exist). further, one would, course, like understand, topological property determines number existence zero modes general case. questions subject investigation. mentioned index theorem odd-dimensional open spaces like r3, however, slightly dierent eld contents. callias index theorem  formulated dirac operator /da, space odd dimensions yangmills higgs background (a, ), actually nontrivial, monopole-like behaviour 11 higgs eld r accounts nonzero index (i.e., dierence number zero modes /da, /d a,). whether index theorem may relevance present context clear yet. finally, want remark apparently obvious generalization (33) work.
