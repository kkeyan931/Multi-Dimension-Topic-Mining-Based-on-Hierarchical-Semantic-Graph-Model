abstract

we investigate a bifurcation of periodic instanton in euclidean action-

temperature diagram in quantum mechanical models. it is analytically shown

that multiple zero modes of uctuation operator should be arised at bifurca-

tion points. this fact is used to derive a condition for the appearance of

bifurcation points in action-temperature diagram. this condition enables one

to compute the number of bifurcation points for a given quantum mechanical

system and hence, to understand the whole behaviour of decay rate. it is ex-

plicitly shown that the previous criterion derived by nonlinear perturbation

or negative-mode consideration is special limit of our case.

i. introduction

recently, much attention is paid to quantum-classical decay-rate transition in various

branches of physics such as spin tunneling systems [13], eld theoretical models [46], and

cosmology [79]. an important issue in this eld is to determine the type of the decay-

rate transition. at zero temperature the decay rate by quantum tunneling is governed by

instanton or bounce [10], and at intermediate range of temperature periodic instanton [11]

plays an important role. at high temperatures the decay takes place mainly by thermal

activation, which is represented by sphaleron [12]. usually the decay-rate transition means

the transition between quantum tunneling regime dominated by periodic instanton and

thermal activity regime dominated by sphaleron.

the type of the decay-rate transition is completely determined by euclidean action-

temperature diagram as shown in ref. [13]. the typical action-temperature diagrams which

appear frequently in quantum mechanical or eld theoretical models can be classied by

three types(see fig. 1). fig. 1(a) represents a smooth second-order transition in which

there is no bifurcation of periodic instanton and hence, the decay rate varies smoothly with

increasing temperature.

in fig. 1(b) there is one bifurcation point and the decay rate

exhibits an abrupt change at the crossover from periodic instanton to sphaleron. thus this

is a typical diagram for the rst-order transition. fig. 1(c) has two bifurcation points and

the decay-rate transition between regimes dominated by periodic instanton and sphaleron,

respectively, is second order. however, there exists a sharp change of decay rate in quantum

tunneling regime in this case. for convenience we call the types of decay-rate transition

associated to fig. 1(a), fig. 1(b), and fig. 1(c) type i, type ii, and type iii, respectively.

in order to determine the type of transition completely from action-temperature dia-

gram one has to compute a periodic instanton explicitly. however, the explicit derivation

of periodic instanton in eld theoretical models is very complicated and sometimes impos-

sible. hence, it is important to develop a method which determines the type of decay-rate

transition without computing the periodic instanton in the full range of temperature.

2

the researches along this direction were done recently by using nonlinear perturbation

method [14,15] or counting the number of negative modes of full hessian operator around

sphaleron [16]. although these two methods start from completely dierent point of view,

both method derive a same criterion for the sharp rst-order transition. since, however,

these two methods use only periodic instanton near sphaleron, it is impossible to distinguish

type iii transition from type i by these methods.

the purpose of this letter is to develop a more powerful method which not only dis-

tinguish type iii from type i but also enable one to understand the whole behaviour of

decay-rate transition by exploring the properties of bifurcation point. in sec. ii we will

show analytically that multiple zero modes should be arised at bifurcation point. this fact

is used to derive a criterion for the appearance of bifurcation point in action-temperature

diagram, which will be explored in sec.

iii. also, application of this criterion to simple

quantum mechanical model will be presented in the same section.

it is shown that the

criterion derived by nonlinear perturbation method is only special limit of our result. in the

nal section a brief conclusion is given.

ii. zero modes at bifurcation point

the decay rate at nite temperatures can be evaluated by euclidean action of periodic

instanton as

(t ) = aese [x]

where a is pre-exponential factor. the euclidean action se[x] is represented as

se[x] = z 

0

d [

1
2

x2 + v (x)],

(1)

(2)

where , period at euclidean space, is given by inverse of temperature, and we assume, for

convenience, particle mass is unity. the equation of motion for periodic instantion is

x = v (x),

3

(3)

where the prime denotes the coordinate derivative, i.e, v (x) = dv /dx, and the euclidean

energy e is

e = v (x) 

1
2

x2.

(4)

now, let us consider periodic instantons x0( ) with period 0 and x1( ) with 1 = 0+.

then we can write

x1( ) = x0(

0
1

 ) +

 x0( ) 




( )


0
[ x0  ( )]

(5)

where ( ) is some periodic function which can be determined from the fact that x0( ) and

x1( ) must be a solutions of equation of motion. hence, ( ) has to satisfy

where m is the uctuation operator at x0;

m  = 2 x0,

m = 

d2
d 2 + v (x0).

using eqs. (4) and (5), one can obtain the ratio between energy and period dierences;

e


=

1


[v (x0) + x0

2  x0 ].

(6)

(7)

(8)

it is worthwhile noting that the right-hand side of eq.(8) is a constant of motion. since

bifurcation point takes place when d

de = 0, the absolute value of the right-hand side of the

above equation must diverge at this point. this means that  must be a singular function

at the same point. in order for  to be singular we need another zero mode dierent from

well-known one, i.e.,

x0 originated from time translational symmetry. this fact can be easily

shown as follows. if we expand the right-hand side of eq.(6) in terms of eigenstates |n >
of m , the equation for  becomes

m| >= xn

an|n >,

4

(9)

where ans are expansion coecients and the prime denotes that the sum excludes the known

zero mode | x0 > due to its orthogonality to | x0 >. then | > can be simply written as

| >= xn

 an
hn|n >,

(10)

where hns are corresponding eigenvalues of m. here, it is shown that in order to get innite

magnitude of | > at bifurcation point, at least one of hns should be zero.this zero mode
does not correspond to the known zero mode( x0) but new zero mode at bifurcation point.

this fact is numerically explored at ref. [16].

in the next section we derive a condition for appearane of bifurcation point in action-

temperature diagram.

iii. condition for bifurcation point

as mentioned in the previous section, the zero mode satises the following second-order

ordinary dierential equation;

d2y
d 2 + v (x0)y = 0.



(11)

since this equation is second order, there are two independent solutions; one is the known

one, y1 = x0, and another is

y2( ) = y1( )z  d 
y2
1( )

= x0( )z 

d 
2( )

x0

.

(12)

this fact does not mean that the periodic instanton x0 always have two independent zero

modes, because in general y2( ) does not satisfy periodic boundary condition. in fact, y2( )

satises the physically relevant boundary condition at only bifurcation point. from the

symmetry of x0( ) one can conjecture that in order for y2( ) to be an another zero mode

x0( ) and y2( ) must have common turning points. using eq.(4), this conjecture can be

mathematically written as

z x+

x

dx

1

(v (x)  e)3/2 =

2

v (x)qv (x)  e 

2

v (x+)qv (x+)  e

(13)

5

where x+ and x are turning points. this is not a desirable expression for the condition of

bifurcation since both sides of this equation are innite. however, if one uses a relation

d
dx

(

1

qv (x)  e

) = 

v (x)

2(v (x)  e)3/2 ,

(14)

the condition for the appearance of bifurcation becomes

f (e)  v (x)z x+

xs

dx

v (x+)  v (x)
(v (x)  e)3/2 + v (x+)z xs

x

dx

v (x)  v (x)
(v (x)  e)3/2 +

= 0,

2[v (x)  v (x+)]

qv (xs)  e

(15)

where xs is sphaleron solution, i.e, position of barrier top. it is easily shown that the values

of f (e) at minimum energy e = emin and at sphaleron energy e = es are positive and

zero, respectively, i.e., f (emin) > 0 and f (es) = 0. since at zeros of f (e) bifurcations take

place, we can determine the type of decay rate from the number of zeros of f (e) in the

range of emin < e < es; non-existence of zeros means type i, one and two zeros correspond

to type ii and type iii, respectively.

now, let us apply our criterion (15) to simple quantum mechanical model whose potential

is

v (x) =

4 + 
12 

1

(16)

numerical calculation using the criterion (15) yields fig. 2 which shows the type of decay

rate along the potential parameter  and. the dashed line distinguishing type iii from

type i cannot be obtained by the criterion of ref. [15] since type i and iii have same behavior

in the vicinity of sphaleron. now, let us derive the previous result of ref. [15] by imposing

a simple restriction on f (e). since the sucient criterion for rst-order transition has been

derived by nonlinear perturbation at sphaleron, it can be obtained from a simple restriction

on value of f (e) near sphaleron;

f (es  ) < 0,

(17)

where  is a innitesimal positive number.

6

since one can put xs = 0 without loss of generality, two integrals of eq.(15) can be

properly expanded in terms of following integrals;

dx

0

gn  z x+
hn  z 0

x

dx

xn

x+  x(x  x)3/2 ,
x  x(x+  x)3/2 .

xn

(18)

(19)

since gn and hn can be exactly evaluated by x, we can expand eq.(17) as increasing power

series of x. then we get rst non-zero term as

5
3

v (0)2
v (0)



+ v (0) < 0,

(20)

where we leave out irrelevant factor. this is the same with the result of nonlinear pertur-

bation method, which means that the previous result is a special case of our condition for

bifurcation.

iv. conclusion

from the fact that an additional zero mode appears at bifurcation points, we derive

the condition eq.(15) for occurrence of bifurcation in action-temperature diagram. using

this condition, one can count the number of bifurcations in allowed energy range and hence,

understand the whole behaviour of decay-rate transition. the sucient criterion for the rst-

order transition can be also derived by imposing a restriction near sphaleron, without use of

nonlinear perturbation [15] or negative-mode consideration [16]. from the restriction it can

be understood that the previous criterion is a condition to have odd number of bifurcations,

so that with the criterion one cannot distinguish type iii from type i. we hope that the

idea for bifurcation in this paper could be generalized to be applicable to eld theoretical

models, which, however, might be non-trivial. work on this direction is in progress.
