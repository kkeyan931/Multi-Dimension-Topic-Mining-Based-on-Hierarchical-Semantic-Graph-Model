abstract

we suggest a simple derivation of the path integral representation for the wilson
loop in su (n ) gauge theory and 4dimensional euclidean spacetime. we show
that the path integral representation derived in ref.
[3] is erroneous. we argue
that no new nonabelian stokes theorem can exist within any path integral repre-
sentation for the wilson loop except the oldfashioned one derived by means of the
pathordering procedure.

introduction

the hypothesis of quark connement bridging between the hypothesis of the existence
of quarks and the failure of the detection of quarks as isolated objects is a challenge for
qcd. as a criterion of colour connement in qcd wilson [1] suggested to consider the
average value of an operator, the wilson loop, dened by

w (c) =

1
n

trpc ei g hc dx a(x) =

1
n

tr u(cxx).

(1.1)

here a(x) = ta aa
(x) is a gauge eld, ta (a = 1, . . . , n 2  1) are the generators of the
su(n) gauge group in fundamental representation normalized by the condition tr (tatb) =
ab/2, g is the gauge coupling constant and c is a closed contour and pc is the operator
ordering colour matrices along the path c. the trace tr (. . .) in eq.(1.1) is computed over
colour indices. the operator

u(cyx) = pcyxe

i g rcyx dz a(z)

,

(1.2)

makes a parallel transport along a path cyx from x to y. for the wilson loop the contour
c coincides with the closed path cxx, where the reference point x belongs to the path,
i.e x  cxx = c. for the practical calculation of the parallel transport operator u(cyx)
the action of the pathordering operator pcyx is dened by the following innitesimal
procedure [2]

u(cyx) = pcxy e

i g rcyx dz a(z)

= lim
n

u(cxkxk1) =

n

n

yk=1
yk=1

= lim
n

u(cyxn1) . . . u(cx2x1) u(cx1x) =

ei g (xk  xk1)  a(xk1),

(1.3)

where cxkxk1 is an innitesimal segment of the path cyx with the endpoints xk and
xk1, then x0 = x and xn = y. the parallel transport operator u(cxkxk1) is dened for
an innitesimal segment cxkxk1 as [2]:

u(cxkxk1) = e

i g rcxk xk1

dz a(z)

= ei g (xk  xk1)  a(xk1).

(1.4)

in accordance with the denition of the pathordering procedure eq.(1.3) the parallel
transport operator u(cyx) possesses the property

u(cyx) = u(cyx1) u(cx1x),

(1.5)

where cyx1 and cx1x are arbitrary nite segments of the path cyx joined to the point x1
which belongs to the path cyx, i.e. x1  cyx. under gauge transformations

a(z)  a

 (z) = (z)a(z)(z) +

1
ig

(z)(z),

(1.6)

with a gauge function (z), the operator u(cyx) with an arbitrary path cyx transforms
as follows

u(cyx)  u (cyx) = (y) u(cyx) (x)

(1.7)

2

thus, it is readily seen that the wilson loop eq.(1.1) is a gauge invariant operator.

as has been postulated by wilson [1] the average value of the wilson loop < w (c) >

in the connement regime should show arealaw fallo [1]

< w (c) > e a,

(1.8)
where  and a are the string tension and the minimal area of the wilson loop, respectively.
as usually the minimal area is a rectangle of size l t . in this case the exponent a can
be represented in the equivalent form  a = v (l) t , where v (l) = l is the interquark
potential and l is the relative distance between quark and antiquark.

2 path integral representation for the wilson loop

attempts to derive a path integral representation for the wilson loop eq.(1.1), where
the path ordering is replaced by a path integral, have been undertaken,e.g., in refs.[35].
the path integral representations have been derived for the wilson loop in terms of gauge
degrees of freedom (bosonic variables) [3,4] and fermionic degrees of freedom (grassmann
variables) [5]. below we derive the path integral representation for the wilson loop in
terms of gauge degrees of freedom and show that the representation suggested in ref.[3]
is erroneous.

the main problem which one encounters with the application of the path integral
representation obtained in ref.[3] for the average value of the wilson loop is in the outcome
[6] that for large loops the area-law fallo is present for colour charges belonging to any
irreducible representation r of su(n) [6]. this conclusion has not been supported by
numerical simulations within lattice qcd [7]. as has been shown in ref.[7] for su(3) in
the connement regime, i.e. at large distances, colour charges with nonzero nality have
string tensions of the corresponding fundamental representation, whereas colour charges
with zero nality are screened by gluons and cannot form a string at large distances.

below we give a derivation of the wilson loop in the form of a path integral over gauge
degrees of freedom for a nonabelian su(n) gauge theory. for this aim is convenient
to represent w (c) in terms of the character of the irreducible representation of su(n)
[810]

wr(c) =

1
dr

r[ur(cxx)],

(2.1)

where the matrix ur(cxx) realizes an irreducible and drdimensional matrix representation
r of the group su(n) with the character r[ur(cxx)] = tr[ur(cxx).

in order to introduce the path integral over gauge degrees of freedom we suggest to

use

z drr[ur

r] r[rvr] =

1
dr

r[urvr],

(2.2)

where the matrices ur and vr belong to the irreducible representation r, and dr is the
haar measure dened on the group su(n) for the irreducible representation r.
it is
normalized by [8]

z dr(

r)a1b1

(r)a2b2

=

1
dr

a1b2

b1a2

.

(2.3)

3

by virtue of eq.(2.2) wr(c) can be represented in the form of the integral

wr(c) =

1

dr z dr(x)r[r(x)ur(cxx)

r(x)].

(2.4)

according to eq.(1.3) and eq.(1.5) we can write the matrix ur(cxx) as follows

ur(cxx) = ur(cxxn1)ur(cxn1xn2) . . . ur(cx2x1)ur(cx1x),

(2.5)

where cxkxk1 is an innitesimal segment of the path c and the index i runs over i =
1, 2, . . . , n and xn = x.

substituting eq.(2.5) in eq.(2.4) and applying (n  1)times eq.(2.2) we end up with

wr(c) = d n2

z dr(x1) . . . r(xn)r[r(xn)ur(cxnxn1)

r
. . . r[r(x1)ur(cx1xn)

r(xn)].

r(xn1)]

using relations r(xk)ur(cxkxk1)

wr(c) = d n2

r

r (cxkxk1) we get

r(xk1) = u 
z dr(x1) . . . dr(xn)
r (cxnxn1)] . . . r[u 

r (cx1xn)].

 r[u 

(2.6)

(2.7)

due to the innitesimality of the segments cxkxk1 we can omit the path ordering operator
for the denition of u 

r (cxkxk1) and set [2]

u 

r (cxkxk1) = exp igzcxk xk1

dza

 (z).

(2.8)

now the problem of the derivation of the path integral representation is reduced to the
evaluation of the characters of u 

r (cxkxk1).

for the simplest case, the gauge group su(2), we have r = j = 0, 1/2, 1, . . . and

dj = 2j + 1. the character j[u 

j (cxkxk1)] is equal to [9]

j[u 

j (cxkxk1)] =

=

j

xm=j
xm=j

j

< m|u 

j (cxkxk1)|m >=

ei m [cxkxk1; a],

(2.9)

where m is the magnetic colour quantum number, |m > and m [cxkxk1; a] are the
eigenstates and eigenvalues of the operator

[cxkxk1; a] = gzcxk xk1

dza

 (z),

(2.10)

i.e. [cxkxk1; a]|m > = m [cxkxk1; a]|m >. the standard procedure for the evalu-
ation of the eigenvalues gives [cxkxk1; a] in the form

[cxkxk1; a] = gzcxk xk1 qg[a(z)]dzdz.

(2.11)

4

where the metric tensor is dened by g[a(z)] = 2 tr[a

 (z)a

 (z)].

substituting eq.(2.9) in eq.(2.7) and taking the limit n   we obtain the represen-
tation for the wilson loop dened for the su(2) gauge group in terms of the path integral
over gauge degrees of freedom

wj(c) =

1

(2j + 1)2 z yxc dj(x)(2j + 1)

j

xm=j

e

imghc qg[a(x)] dxdx ,

(2.12)

where the computation of the sum over the magnetic colour quantum number m does not
commute with the integration over the gauge functions j(x) at x  c = cxx.
comparing our path integral representation eq.(2.12) with that suggested in ref.[3]
(see eq.(23) of ref.[3]) one nds rather strong disagreement. first, this concerns the
contributions of dierent states m of the representation u 
j (cxx). in our case there is
a summation over all values of the magnetic colour quantum number m, whereas the
representation of ref.[3] contains only one term with m = j. second, the authors of
ref.[3] claim that the exponent of the path integral representation should depend only on
the gauge eld projected onto the third axis in the colour group space. however, this is
only possible if the gauge functions are slowly varying with x, i.e. (xk)(xk1)  1. in
this case the parallel transport operator u (cxkxk1) would read [10]

u (cxkxk1) = exp i g zcxk xk1

 (z) =
= 1 + i g (xi  xi1)  a(xi1),

dz a

and the evaluation of the character j[u 

j (cxkxk1] would run as follows

j (cxkxk1)]|m >= 1 + (ta

< m|[u 
= 1 + m i g (xk  xk1)  [a(xk1)](3) = e

j )mm i g (xk  xk1)  [a(xk1)](a) =
 (z)](3)
,

dz[a

m i grcxk xk1

(2.13)

(2.14)

i.e.
j )mm = m a3. more generally the exponent on the r.h.s. of eq.(2.14) can be writ-

where we have used the matrix elements of the generators of the su(2) group,
(ta
ten as

zcxk xk1

dz[a

 (z)](3) = 2zcxk xk1

dztr[t3

j a

 (z)].

(2.15)

this gives the path integral representation for the wilson loop dened for the su(2)
gauge group in the from

wj(c) =

1

(2j + 1)2 z yxc dj(x)(2j + 1)

j

xm=j

e2imghc dx tr[t3

j a

 (x)].

(2.16)

the exponent contains the gauge eld projected onto the third axis in the colour space
tr[t3
 (x)]. nevertheless, eq.(2.16) diers form eq.(23) of ref.[3] by a summation over all

j a

5

values of the colour magnetic quantum number m of the given irreducible representation
j.

the repeated application of eq.(2.2) induces that the integrations over the gauge func-
tion at xk are completely independent of the integrations at xk1. there is no mechanism
which leads to gauge functions smoothly varying with xk (k = 1, . . . n). in this sense the
situation is opposite to the quantum mechanical path integral. in quantum mechanics
the integration over all paths is restricted by the kinetic term of the lagrange function.
in the semiclassical limit h  0 due to the kinetic term the uctuations of all trajectories
are shrinked to zero around a classical trajectory. however, in the case of the integra-
tion over gauge functions for the path integral representation of the wilson loop, there
is neither a suppression factor nor a semiclassical limit like h  0. the key point of
the application of eq.(2.2) and, therefore, the path integral representation for the wilson
loop is that all integrations over (xk) (k = 1, . . . , n) are completely independent and can
dier substantially even if the points, where the gauge functions (xk) and (xk1) are
dened, are linked by an innitesimal segment cxkxk1.

for the derivation of eq.(23) of ref.[3] the moments of inertia i, ik  0 have used
as parameters like h  0. an analogy between the integration over gauge degrees of
freedom and the evolution of an axially symmetric top (see eq.(9) of ref.[3]) has been
drawn. this analogy has led to the erroneous result.

3 the su (n ) extension

the extension of the path integral representation given in eq.(2.12) to su(n) is rather
straightforward and reduces to the evaluation of the character of the matrix u 
r (cxkxk1)
in the irreducible representation r of su(n). the character can be given by [9]

r[u 

r (cxkxk1)] = tr(eipn 1

= xm

=1 h[cxkxk1; a]) =

 m ei m  [cxkxk1; a],

(3.1)

where h ( = 1, . . . , n  1) are diagonal dr  dr traceless matrices realizing the repre-
sentation of the cartan subalgebra, i.e. [h, h] = 0, of the generators of the su(n) [9].
the sum runs over all the weights m = (m1, . . . , mn 1) of the irreducible representation

r and  m is the multiplicity of the weight m and pm  m = dr. the components of the

vector [cxkxk1; a] are dened by

[cxkxk1; a] = gzcxk xk1

 [(z)],

(3.2)

where we have introduced the notation (z) = taa(z) = dz  a(z). the functions
 [(z)] are proportional to the roots of the equation deth(z)  i = 0.
the path integral representation of the wilson loop dened for the irreducible repre-

sentation r of su(n) reads

wr(c) =

1
d2

r z yxc dr(x) drxm

 m ei g m hc  [(z)],

(3.3)

6

where the summation over all weights and the integration over r(x) do not commute.

let us consider in more details the path integral representation of the wilson loop
dened for the fundamental representation 3 of the su(3) gauge group. the character
3[u 

3 (c)] is dened as

3[u 

3 (c)] = tr(cid:16)eih11[c; a] + ih22[c; a](cid:17) = ei2[c; a]/3
+ei1[c; a]/23 ei2[c; a]/6 + ei1[c; a]/23 ei2[c; a]/6,

(3.4)
where h1 = t3/3 and h2 = t8/3 [9]. for the representation 3 of the su(3) gauge
group the equation det[  ] = 0 takes the form

the roots of eq.(3.5) read

4 the nonabelian stokes theorem

the derivation of the arealaw fallo promoted great interests in the nonabelian stokes
theorem expressing the exponent of the wilson loop in terms of a surface integral over
the 2dimensional surface s with the boundary c = s [12]

trpcei g hc dx a(x) = trps e

i g 1

2 rrs

d(y) u(cxy) g(y) u(cyx)

,

(4.1)

where ps is the surface ordering operator [12], d(y) is a 2dimensional surface element
in 4dimensional spacetime, x is a current point on the contour c, i.e. x  c, y is a point
on the surface s, i.e. y  s, and g(y) = a(y)  a(y)  ig[a(y), a(y)] is the
eld strength tensor. the procedure of the derivation of the nonabelian stokes theorem
in the form of eq.(4.1) contains a summation of contributions of closed paths around
innitesimal areas and these paths are linked to the reference point x on the contour c
via parallel transport operators. the existence of closed paths linked to the references
point x on the contour c is a necessary and a sucient condition for the derivation of
the nonabelian stokes theorem eq.(4.1).

due to the absence of closed paths it is rather clear that the path integral represen-
tation for the wilson loop cannot be applied to the derivation of the nonabelian stokes
theorem. in fact, from eq.(2.10) one can see that the evaluation of the path integral over
gauge degrees of freedom demands the decomposition of the closed contour c into a set of
innitesimal segments which can be never closed. let us prove this statement by assuming
the converse. suppose that by representing the path integral over gauge degrees of free-
dom in the form of the ndimensional integral eq.(2.7) we have a closed segment. let the
segment cxkxk1 be closed and the point x belong to the segment cxkxk1, x  cxkxk1.
by using eq.(2.2) we can represent the character r[u 

r (cxkxk1)] by

r (cxkxk1)] = r[u 

r[u 
= r[(xi)ur(cxix)ur(cxxi1)(xi1)] =

r (cxix)u 

r (cxxi1)] =

= drz dr(x)r[r(xi)ur(cxix)
= drz dr(x)r[u 
r (cxix)] r[u 

r (cxxi1)].

r(x)] r[r(x)ur(cxxi1)(xi1)] =

(4.2)

this transforms an (n  1)dimensional integral with one closed innitesimal segment
into an ndimensional integral without closed segments. since nally n tends to innity
there is no closed segments for the representation for the path integral in the form of an
(n  1)dimensional integral. as this statement is general and valid for any path integral
representation of the wilson loop, so one can conclude that no further nonabelian stokes
theorem can be derived within any path integral approach for the wilson loop.

5 conclusion

for a derivation of the path integral for the wilson loop in su(n) gauge theories we have
used only the obvious properties of the characters of the group representations. unlike
the representation given in ref. [3] the resultant integrand of the path integral contains a

8

phase factor which is not projected onto abelian degrees of freedom of nonabelian gauge
elds. the important point of our representation is the summation over all states of the
given irreducible representation r of su(n). for example, in su(2) the phase factor
is summed over all values of the colourmagnetic quantum number m of the irreducible
representation j of the colour charges. this contradicts eq.(23) of ref.[3], where only the
term with the highest value of the colourmagnetic quantum number m = j is taken into
account and the others 2j terms are lost. the loss of these terms has been caused by an
articial reduction of independent integrations over gauge functions to strongly correlated
integrations.

the use of an incorrect path integral representation for the wilson loop [6] has led
to the conclusion that for large distances the average value of the wilson loop takes
the form of the arealaw fallo for any irreducible representation r of the su(n) gauge
group. unfortunately, this result is not supported by numerical simulations of lattice
qcd [7]. at large distances, colour charges with nonzero nality have string tensions of
the corresponding fundamental representation, whereas colour charges with zero nality
are screened by gluons and cannot form a string.

finally we have shown that within any path integral representation for the wilson
loop in terms of gauge degrees of freedom no nonabelian stokes theorem in addition
to eq.(4.1) can be derived.
indeed, the stokes theorem replaces a line integral over a
closed contour by a surface integral with the closed contour as the boundary of a surface.
however, approximating the path integral by an ndimensional integral at n   there
are no closed paths linking two neighbouring points along the wilson loop. thereby,
the line integrals over these open paths cannot be replaced by surface integrals. thus,
we argue that any non-abelian stokes theorem can be derived only within the denition
of the wilson loop through the path ordering procedure eq.(4.1). of course, one can
represent the surfaceordering operator ps in eq.(4.1) in terms of a path integral over
gauge degrees of freedom, but this should not be a new nonabelian stokes theorem
in comparison with the old one given by eq.(4.1). that is why the claims of ref.[35]
concerning new versions of the nonabelian stokes theorems derived within path integral
representations for the wilson loop seem unjustied.
discussions with jan thomassen are appreciated.
