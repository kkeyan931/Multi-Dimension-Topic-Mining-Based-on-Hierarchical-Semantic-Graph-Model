abstract

we carefully re-examine the issues of solving the modied bianchi identity, anomaly can-
cellations and ux quantization in the s1/z2 orbifold of m-theory using the boundary-free
upstairs formalism, avoiding several misconceptions present in earlier literature. while the

solution for the four-form g to the modied bianchi identity appears to depend on an arbitrary

parameter b, we show that requiring g to be globally well-dened, i.e. invariant under small

and large gauge and local lorentz transformations, xes b = 1. this value also is necessary

for a consistent reduction to the heterotic string in the small-radius limit. insisting on prop-

erly dening all elds on the circle, we nd that there is a previously unnoticed additional

contribution to the anomaly inow from the eleven-dimensional topological term. anomaly
cancellation then requires a quadratic relation between b and the combination 6/4 of the

gauge and gravitational coupling constants  and . this contrasts with previous beliefs that

anomaly cancellation would give a cubic equation for b. we observe that our solution for g

automatically satises integer or half-integer ux quantization for the appropriate cycles. we

explicitly write out the anomaly cancelling terms of the heterotic string as inherited from the

m-theory approach. they dier from the usual ones by the addition of a well-dened local

counterterm. we also show how ve-branes enter our analysis.

1. introduction and summary

ever since the emergence of m-theory and its relation to the various perturbative string the-

ories, considerations of anomaly cancellation have played a crucial role.
in particular, in
reconstructing the strongly-coupled e8  e8 heterotic string from m-theory compactied on
s1/z2 [1, 2], an important ingredient was the observation that the gauge and gravitational
anomaly polynomial of the e8  e8 heterotic string can be written as a sum of two terms,
each being associated with one e8 factor, and that each of these terms separately factorises

as required by anomaly cancellation through a green-schwarz mechanism. this enables local
anomaly cancellation on each of the two ten-dimensional s1/z2 xed planes in the m-theory
picture [1, 2, 3]. the anomaly-cancelling terms in m-theory are of two types: one is a green-

schwarz termr g  x7 where g is the (modied) eld strength of the three-form c and x7

is a purely gravitational chern-simons type seven-form. the presence of this green-schwarz

term was well-known from string duality [4, 5] and as a cancelling term for the m-theory

ve-brane anomaly [5, 6]. the second contribution is anomaly inow from the topological

interaction term of eleven-dimensional supergravity [7]r c  g g. in uncompactied eleven-

dimensional m-theory both terms are gauge and local lorentz invariant and no anomaly needs
to be cancelled in this odd dimension. however, orbifold compactications like s1/z2 involve
chiral projections on the even-dimensional xed planes and then there are chiral anomalies

which need to be cancelled. on the other hand, it has been shown in [2] that closure of the
supersymmetry algebra for the s1/z2 orbifold implies a modication of the bianchi identity

dg = 0, and this is why ther g  x7 andr c  g  g terms have non-vanishing anomalous

transformations under gauge and local so(9, 1) lorentz transformations on the xed planes.

this is the basic mechanism at the origin of local anomaly cancellation.

in ref. [2], the modied bianchi identity dg 6= 0 was solved in a particular way and it was
concluded that anomaly cancellation requires a certain xed ratio 3/2 of the gauge coupling

 and the gravitational coupling . subsequent analyses [813] have in particular emphasized
that there actually is a one-parameter family of solutions g(b), b  r, to the modied bianchi

it was concluded that anomaly cancellation alone does not x the ratio 3/2 but
identity.

 of course, to any solution g(0) = dc + . . . of dg = . . . one can add a da(3) with any three-form a(3).
the point is that most of these a(3) can be reabsorbed into c. so the only relevant a(3) must be made
from the gauge and lorentz chern-simons three-form (3) on the xed planes so that essentially the only
freedom is a(3)  b(3) with one real parameter b.

relates it to a cubic polynomial in this parameter b. it was argued that this parameter and
hence 3/2 can be xed if one also takes into account the quantization of the ux of g [14].

in this paper, we carefully reanalyse the issues of solving the modied bianchi identity,
anomaly cancellation and ux quantization for the s1/z2 orbifold. we use the upstairs
formalism where one works on the boundary-free circle s1 and imposes a z2 projection on the
elds. however, contrary to most of the previous papers, we insist on dening properly all
elds on s1, i.e. elds should be periodic. this immediately rules out the use of the step
function (x11) as a primitive of a delta function (x11) on the circle. using instead a correctly
periodically dened function (x11) such that     1
2 turns out to be crucial to obtain a
consistent solution g to the modied bianchi identity. we carefully investigate gauge and local

lorentz invariance of g. it turns out that insisting on invariance under large transformations,

i.e.

insisting on having a globally well-dened g, is very powerful. it not only implies the

well-known cohomology condition [15], but it also xes the parameter b of the solution g

to be 1, as long as there are topologically non-trivial gauge or gravity congurations with
2tr r2) 6= 0. the same conclusion b = 1 is obtained if ve-branes are present. the
value b = 1 also appears to be the only one which allows a safe truncation to the perturbative

r (tr f 2
i  1

heterotic string: although the zero-modes on the circle correctly give the desired relation
h = db ym + l for all values of b, the neglected higher modes are gauge and local lorentz
invariant only if b = 1. note that these arguments leading to b = 1 are not a consequence

of g-ux quantization. we note that the downstairs approach automatically incorporates a

correspondingly xed value of b.

looking carefully at anomaly cancellations also yields some surprises. we do the analysis
for arbitrary parameter b. again the use of the periodic (x11) is crucial, in particular the
constant term in     1
2 plays an important role. due to this term, the relation between
b and the ratio 3/2 required by anomaly cancellation is drastically modied with respect to

previous analyses [2, 813]: the terms cubic in b cancel, and one is left with a quadratic equation
for b namely b2 = 12
(4)5 6/4. also, to obtain this equation, one has to evaluate products of the
form (x11)(x11)(x11) where (x11) is our periodic generalisation of the step function. but

of course, this product is ill-dened and should be regularised. any reasonable regularisation
yields (x11)(x11)(x11)  1

is aected by the presence of ve-branes.

we then conclude that b must be one, and hence 6 = (4)5

12 4. indeed, in any topolog-
2 tr r2) 6= 0 we have b = 1. anomaly
cancellation then xes the ratio 6/4 = (4)5
12 . but this ratio does not depend
on whether the integral is zero or not, so that by this same equation b = 1 always (strictly
speaking: b2 = 1). it is worthwhile noticing that g diers from dc also away from the xed

planes since b 6= 0. we further note that the green-schwarz termr g x7 also automatically

ensures cancellation of the ve-brane anomalies without any need of further modication. as

a consistency check of our solution we show how the combination of the topological term and

the green-schwarz term in eleven dimensions leads to the green-schwarz term of the heterotic

string.

another subtle point is ux quantization of g. in the downstairs approach where one

considers m-theory compactied on the interval i = s1/z2, i.e.
dimensional boundary planes of the eleven-dimensional space-time, there is no modication of

in the presence of ten-

the bianchi identity dg = 0, but there is a non-trivial boundary condition on g [2] enabling

the necessary anomaly inow to cancel the one-loop anomaly on the boundary planes. this

boundary condition does not admit a free parameter like b (i.e. it is equivalent to a xed value
2tr r2)|boundary. witten concluded [14] that for any
g has to be integer or half-integer. in particular, this ensures

dened only for integer ux, but it was shown in ref. [14] that in the case of half-integer ux

the three-dimensional membrane functional integral has a parity anomaly [17] which precisely

cancels the sign ambiguity due to the half-integrality of the g-ux.

in the boundary-free

upstairs approach where the bianchi identity for g is modied this same ux quantization

should appear as a consequence of our solution. we will show that this is indeed the case.
any four-cycle c4 can be written as a sum of four-cycles not involving the x11-direction and of
four-cycles of the form s1  c3 with c3 not in the x11-direction. in the rst case our solution

g to the modied bianchi identity straightforwardly yields wittens result of integer or half-
integer ux (provided one correctly relates 2
downstairs with the necessary factor of
1/2 [9]). four-cycles of the second type wrap around the circle s1. there is no analogue of

upstairs and 2

these cycles in the downstairs approach, and we cannot conclude on any quantization from the

results of [14]. indeed, for such cycles, we nd that the b dependence trivially cancels (as always

dc  1

when integrating over the circle, thanks to the modication of the step function in order to be

periodic!) and one is left with an integral a rs1c3
2pirc3ei where the sum is
over the two xed planes and ei is a combination of gauge and lorentz chern-simons three-
forms on the ith plane. this integral is closely related to the uxr h =r (db  ym + l) in

the heterotic string. the latter was discussed some time ago [18] and it was concluded (when
appropriately normalised) to be of the form n +  with n  z,   r. the same argument
holds here and we conclude that the gauge and local lorentz invariant combination a cannot
be determined further. the reason of course is that since g 6= dc one cannot use the standard
argument to obtain ux quantization. we conclude that for four-cycles not wrapping the circle
s1 we have standard integer or half-integer ux quantization, while if the four-cycle wraps the
s1 we cannot say anything interesting about the ux of g.

this paper is organised as follows. in section 2, we discuss preliminaries: conventions and
normalisations, and the correctly modied, periodically-dened step function (x11) on the

circle, as well as the above-mentioned occurrence of an extra factor of 1/3 when evaluating

integrals involving . in section 3, we carefully solve the modied bianchi identity for g

and discuss gauge and local lorentz invariance and how the global denition of g xes b. we

also comment on the relation to the perturbative heterotic string. section 4 discusses anomaly
cancellations and the quadratic relation between b and 6/4 is obtained. section 5 is devoted

to ux (non) quantization of g and in section 6 we spell out the heterotic anomaly-cancelling

terms as inherited from the present m-theory approach. we conclude in section 7 and an

appendix summarises the relevant anomaly polynomials [19, 20] needed in this paper.

2. preliminaries

2.1. conventions and normalisations

since in the next section we want to pin down various numerical coecients, normalisations

are important. our conventions are as follows.

normalisations of elds and couplings

the anomaly polynomials i12(1loop)i, x8 and i4,i are dened in the appendix. in particular
we have

i4,i =

for any four-cycle c4. for dierential forms, we use the standard normalisation: a p-form a(p)
is given in terms of its completely antisymmetric components as

a(p) =

a(p)
1...p dx1  . . .  dxp =

and d = dx so that in particular f = da + a2 = 1
eld of eleven-dimensional supergravity c = 1

2 f dx  dx and for the three-form

3!c dx  dx  dx.

the normalisation of the eleven-dimensional supergravity action [7] is

(2.3)

where r is the curvature scalar and e the square root of the determinant of the eleven-
dimensional metric.   11 is the eleven-dimensional gravitational coupling. the so-called
topological term is of central importance for us:

stop =

122z c  g  g,

(2.4)

where g = dc + . . . omitted terms indicated by . . . involve the gravitino eld.

 our normalisation is related to the one used by horava and witten [2] by chw

similarly, the action for the ten-dimensional gauge elds is

sgauge = 

1

42z d10x g10 fabf ab + . . . ,

(2.5)

with gauge coupling constant  and f = da + a2. on the s1/z2 xed planes, g10 is the
restriction of the eleven-dimensional metric to the planes.

as usual, we use , , . . . for eleven-dimensional indices and a, b, . . . for ten-dimensional

ones.

engineering dimensions

it is often useful to have in mind the dimensions of the various quantities and couplings.
taking [mass] = 1 as usual, one has [] =  9
2 and [] = 3. with these two parameters,
a dimensionless combination is 3
2 ] = 3 and this latter combination may be used
whenever a dimensionful constant is needed. gauge and lorentz connections have dimension

2 while [ 2

one and then [r] = [f ] = 2 so that [i4,i] = 4 and [x8] = 8. we also take [c] = 0 and [g] = 1

(for forms, by [c] we really mean [c], etc. . . ).

2.2. the orbifold s1/z2

we consider the eleven-dimensional manifold as the product of a ten-dimensional manifold
m10 and a circle s1. for notational convenience, and to emphasize that the coordinate on the
circle is an angular variable (we are working in the upstairs approach), we use

  [, ]  s1 ,

(2.6)

rather than x11. this denition also means that we work in general on a circle with unit radius.

we will however reintroduce an arbitrary radius r when discussing the small-radius limit, i.e.
the perturbative heterotic limit. this will be done by assuming that   [r, r]. the z2
symmetry acts by    so that the two xed planes are copies of m10 at  = 0  1 and
 =   2. we then dene the one-forms

1 = () d ,

2 = (  ) d .

(2.7)

these one-forms are well-dened on the circle s1 by denition, i.e.

2 = (  ) d 
( + ) d. we further need zero-forms i such that di includes i. determining a primitive

6

of a -function on a circle requires however a minimum of care: a simple step function ()

will not do the job since it is not periodic. this simple fact apparently has been overlooked


in previous discussions of anomaly inow through the modied bianchi identity.

in fact there

cannot be a function () on the circle, i.e. a periodic function () = ( + 2), such that
() = (). would it exist, one would also have
 d () =
()  () = 0. the best one can do is to dene for   [, ]

 d () =r

it is periodic, odd under z2, and satises 1() = 1() = 0. similarly one denes 2() =
1() = 2()  1
1(  ). these functions satisfy 
 . in form
notation, these denitions can be concisely written as

2() = 2(  )  1

 and 

di = 2i

d ,

i = 1, 2.

(2.9)

later on we will need integrals of products of these i over the circle. they are elementary

and can be concisely written as

zs1

d ij = (cid:18)ij 

1

3(cid:19) ,

i, j = 1, 2,

(2.10)

where of course here and in the following ij stands for the kronecker symbol. since the i()

are odd functions with respect to the z2, one also has

zs1

d i = 0 .

(2.11)

another delicate point concerns integrals of products of one  function and two  functions,

which are z2-even distributions. it is often argued that one can replace e.g. 111 by 1 since

 the issue of perodicity is correctly addressed in ref [21]. this paper studies background congurations
for the four-form g and the same terms linear in  as in our () below do appear. this paper does not
discuss anomaly inow.

 for the integral of a periodic function one can of course integrate over any interval of length 2. however,
since the orbifold singularities are at 0 and   , in order to avoid misinterpretations and have each
singularity exactly once, it is preferable not to integrate from  to  but to slightly shift the interval of

integration. thus, for example,r 

 d is meant to be lim0r 

 d.

7

due to the  only the immediate vicinity of  = 0 is important, and then (1(0))2  +1.
this argument is certainly incorrect. an expression like 111 is ill-dened and has to be

regularised. one could as well say that 1(0) = 0, implying 111 = 0 and this would be

equally wrong. any sensible regularisation should preserve the one relation we want to hold,

namely (2.9), as well as z2-oddness of the i. then indeed in the vicinity of  = 0 the linear
piece / in 1 is unimportant and

2.3. the modified bianchi identity for g

horava and witten [2] consider the eleven-dimensional supergravity action (2.3) on the product
of m10 with the orbifold s1/z2, coupled to e8 super-yang-mills actions located on the two m10
xed planes, at  = 0 and  = . the orbifold projection eliminates elds odd under z2. in

particular, invariance of stop implies that cabc is odd and projected out, while cab,11 is even

and kept. the z2 projection also breaks one half of the thirty-two supersymmetries. preserving

the sixteen remaining supersymmetries requires however a modication of the bianchi identity

of the four-form eld g, involving the yang-mills curvatures. as usual in string eective

actions, anomaly cancellation in turn requires the appearance in this modication of lorentz

curvatures: this contribution cannot be derived from supersymmetry of eective actions with

up to two derivatives.

instead of dg = 0, the modied bianchi identity is postulated to be [2]

dg =

2xi

i(cid:18)tr f 2

i

2

tr r2(cid:19) .

(2.15)

as already mentioned, the classical supersymmetry calculation only yields the tr f 2 term. the
tr r2 term is a higher-order eect. the factor 2/2 can be inferred by simple dimensional

analysis, since [i] = 1.

3. solution of the modied bianchi identity

3.1. a one-parameter family of solutions

we now proceed to solve the modied bianchi identity (2.15). the combination of tr f 2
i
and tr r2 that appears is usually called i4,i. our normalisations for all relevant anomaly-
related polynomials in f and r are summarised in appendix a. in particular, we have i4,i =

1

(4)2(cid:0)tr f 2
i  1

2tr r2(cid:1) and thus the bianchi identity reads

2xi
dg = (4)2 2

i  i4,i .

(3.1)

since i has support only on the ith xed plane and is a one-form  d, only the values of the
smooth four-form i4,i on this xed plane matter and only the components not including d
are relevant. for the gauge piece tr f 2
i this is automatic, but for the tr r2 piece this is a non-
trivial statement. it will prove convenient to use two-dimensional descent equations i4 = d3,
3 = d1
2 with all forms having no d component. we will use the following convention: a
tilde on a p-form a(p)

and by setting the argument  = i, i.e. equal to 0 or  depending on whether i = 1 or 2.

clearly, d takes a tilde p-form to a tilde (p + 1)-form: dea(p)
we can then replace i4,i by ei4,i which has the eect of replacing r  eri  er|=i. one has
eri = dei +ei ei with ei the correspondingly mutilated spin-connection. using this ei, one

note the presence of the last



of the i() and will turn out to play a most crucial role.

adding ve-branes

we will also consider situations where there are ve-branes. each ve-brane has a world-
volume w6,a where a labels the dierent ve-branes. since ve-branes wrapping the circle s1
can easily be seen to play no particular role in the discussions of section 3.3 and 4.4 below,
we will concentrate on ve-branes that are perpendicular to s1, and we denote by a the
coordinate at which they intersect the circle. let there be n5 such ve-branes. to each of
them one associates a brane current (5)(w6,a), analogous to the i of the ten-planes. this
brane current then contains a piece (  a)d with the remaining piece called (4)(w6,a).
the bianchi identity for g then gets an extra contribution [6]

dg|5brane contribution = 

(5)(w6,a) = 

n5xa=1

n5xa=1

(  a) d  (4)(w6,a) .

(3.7)

accordingly, g gets an extra contribution. just as before when integrating iei4,i one now has
a choice when integrating (  a)d  (4)(w6,a), introducing more free parameters:
d  ()(3)(w6,a)(cid:21)

g|5brane contribution = 

n5xa=1(

2(cid:20)1(  a) (4)(w6,a) 
 (1  ) (  a) d  ()(3)(w6,a)) .

(3.8)

it is straightforward to verify, using eqs (2.9) and (2.7) that the exterior derivative of the r.h.s.

of (3.8) indeed yields the r.h.s. of (3.7) for any choice of parameter  provided

d()(3)(w6,a) = (4)(w6,a) .

(3.9)

again, there are many dierent choices for ()(3)(w6,a) but since (4)(w6,a) does not involve
the circle coordinate  which primitive ()(3)(w6,a) is chosen is irrelevant here.

 actually, this equation will turn out to be quadratic in bi and hence has another solution: b1 = b2  b.
however, we will see soon that b1 = +b2 = 1 is needed as soon as topologically non-trivial congurations
exist.

3.2. gauge and local lorentz invariance

now we want g to be gauge and local lorentz invariant. while ei4,i
simons three-formei is not and hence c cannot be invariant either. since the variation of c

will be crucial for anomaly cancellation, care must be taken. the most general c giving an

is invariant, the chern-



invariant g is

c = db1

(3.10)

with some two-form b1

2 we must consider the z2-orbifold
projection on the eld c. recall that cabc is odd and hence projected out, while cab,11 is

2 linear in g or l. to determine b1

even and kept. but cabc = 0 only makes sense if it is a gauge invariant statement, i.e. we

must have cabc = 0. this yields

(3.12)

note that c would be gauge invariant in the bulk (i.e. away from the xed planes) were it

not for the last term in (3.11), again due to enforcing periodicity of the step functions i().

let us repeat that c is such that g = 0.

 note that the ve-brane contribution to g is eld-independent and thus does not change c.

12

3.3. global definition of g: invariance under large transformations

so far we have considered invariance under small transformations that can be continuously

deformed to the identity. however, g must also be invariant under large gauge and large local

lorentz transformations. this will be precisely the case if g is globally well-dened. there is

a simple criterion when this is true [15]. if g is globally well-dened, i.e. dg is exact, then
dg = 0. take c5 = c4  s1 where c4 is an arbitrary
four-cycle at xed value of  or homologous to such a cycle and rewrite dg using the bianchi

for any (closed) ve-cycle c5 one hasrc5

identity (3.4) together with (3.7). one then gets

2(cid:19) = n5

(3.13)

where n5 is the number of ve-branes intersecting s1 and c4 at a point. the analogous
cohomology condition is well-known from the heterotic string. so g will be invariant also

under large transformations precisely if this condition holds. of course, since we do want g

to be invariant we assume this condition henceforth.

however, there is one more important piece of information we can obtain from requiring
global denition of g and using stokes theorem. consider a ve-dimensional manifold v
which intersects exactly one of the xed planes on a four-cycle. for example, we may take it
of the form v = i  c where c is a four-cycle and i is the interval [1, 2] with  < 1 < 0
and 0 < 2 < . then v = c(2)  c(1) and stokes theorem gives

zv

dg = zc(2)

g  zc(1)

g .

(3.14)

now, the integral on the l.h.s.

is evaluated using the modied bianchi identity. the contri-

bution (3.4), due to the -function, collapses to an integral of ei4,1 over the four-cycle c on

the xed plane. the ve-brane contribution (3.7) to dg yields an extra term n5(i), where
n5(i) is the number of ve-branes that intersect the interval i and the four-cycle c. on the
other hand, the integrals on the r.h.s are evaluated using the solution (3.6) and (3.8) for g.
only the components gabcd contribute, i.e. from (3.6) only the piece b
(3.8) only the piece 

2pi iei4,i and from
2 pa 1( a)(4)(w6,a) contribute. for the integral at  = 2 one has

13

 and 2(2) =  2

1(2) = 1  2
and 2(1) =  1
. furthermore rc(2) 1(  a)(4)(w6,a) rc(1) 1(  a)(4)(w6,a) equals 12

 . of course rc(2)ei4,i = rc(1)ei4,i = rcei4,i since ei4,i

 , while for the integral at  = 1 one has 1(1) = 1  1

is independent of

ve-brane does not intersect the interval i and equals 2 + 12

if the



if it does intersect i. using



(3.13) and collecting all the pieces, eq. (3.14) becomes

zc ei4,1 + n5(i) =

2zc ei4,1 

1  2



n5 +


2

(cid:18)2n5(i) +

1  2



n5(cid:19) .

(3.15)

but the exact positions of 1 and 2 are arbitrary, and upon slightly varying them such
that n5(i) remains unchanged one concludes that the terms linear in 1  2 and the terms
independent of 1  2 must vanish separately. this yields two equations:

(  b)n5 = 0 ,

(1  )n5(i) + (1  b)zc ei4,1 = 0 .

(3.16)

had we chosen the ve-manifold v to intersect the other xed plane we would have obtained

an analogous equation with ei4,2 .
let rst n5 = 0 so that one simply gets (1  b)rcei4,1 = 0. there are two possibilities.
if rstly rcei4,1 = 0, each of the two source terms in the modied bianchi identity is coho-
mologically trivial, so that the ei can be globally well-dened. in this case we see that b is
unconstrained. secondly, ifrcei4,1 6= 0 each of the two source terms individually is cohomolog-

ically non-trivial (although their sum is trivial by (3.13)), and one must take b = 1. note that

b = 1 eliminates the terms in g containing -functions so that g becomes nite everywhere
on s1.

now let n5 6= 0. then the rst eq. (3.16) gives  = b and the second eq. gives (rcei4,1 +

n5(i))(1 b) = 0. upon varying the interval i we may change n5(i) (unless all ve-branes are
stuck on the xed planes) and conclude that b = 1. thus global denition of g xes b =  = 1.

14

the resulting four-form g then reads:

g|b=1, =1 = dc +





2xi=1,2
1(  a) (4)(w6,a)
n5xa=1
iei4,i +
d xi=1,2ei +
()(3)(w6,a) .
n5xa=1


2

(3.17)

to summarize, with the z2 projection (3.12) on the three-index tensor, global denition

of g corresponds to the transformation (3.11) and the cohomology condition (3.13), as well as

(3.16).

3.4. the case b = 1

as just noted, b = 1 is required whenever r ei4,i

6= 0 or ve-branes not wrapping the circle
are present. in this case delta-function singularities are absent from g. the case b = 1 also

presents some other interesting and important features when considering eqs. (3.6) and (3.11)

from the point of view of reduction to the perturbative heterotic string. for this we take

n5 = 0.

expanding gabc,11 and cab,11 in fourier modes along s1 straightforwardly leads to

g(0)
abc,11 = d[ac(0)
g(n)
abc,11 = d[ac(n)

bc],11 +

bc],11 


2

2

[e1 +e2]abc,
(b  1)[e1 + (1)ne2]abc,

n > 0.

(3.18)

the zero mode is b-independent. since g is gauge and local lorentz invariant we see that
c(0)
ab,11 can be neither gauge nor local lorentz invariant. on the other hand, the higher modes
of cab,11 are gauge and local lorentz invariant if and only if b = 1. to make contact with

ten-dimensional heterotic strings in the eld-theory (perturbative) limit, we want to truncate

cab,11 to its zero-mode only, and this truncation is safe only if the higher modes are gauge

invariant. this again points towards b = 1.

in the next section we will show that anomaly cancellations relate b2 and 6/4, but do

not x one or the other. however, the gauge and local lorentz variation of the topological

term will have a b-dependent contribution which is a variation of a (local) counterterm and

15

hence does not contribute to the formal twelve-form which characterizes the anomaly. the

appearance of this term is related to the b-dependent contributions in the variation of c, and

then to the higher modes in its expansion. on the other hand, a direct calculation of the
anomaly-cancelling terms, by rst truncating c to c(0) and then calculating the resulting

ten-dimensional action leads directly to a green-schwarz term which corresponds to b = 1, the

case in which all truncated modes are gauge invariant. this will be done in sect. 6.

the conclusion then is that anomaly cancellation alone does not x b. the perturbative
heterotic limit however (the small s1 radius limit) selects b = 1 because it ensures gauge

invariance of the massive modes. this condition is essentially due to compactication on a

small space. as we have seen in the previous subsection, global considerations also impose

b = 1, provided topologically non-trivial congurations occur.

3.5. a consistency check: reduction to the heterotic string

when the circle s1 is very small the perturbative heterotic string theory must emerge. the

elds of the latter are dened (modulo possible rescalings) as the zero-modes of the fourier

expansion on the circle of the corresponding m-theory elds.

in particular, as mentioned

already

ab,11 =

habc  g(0)

abc,11 =

2r

cab,11() d ,

gabc,11() d ,

(3.19)

where we have introduced an arbitrary radius r of s1. integrating the abc, 11 components
of the solution (3.6) for g over the circle s1 yields

h = db +



2rxi ei .

(3.20)

as already observed in (3.18), the parameter b disappears thanks to the last term in (3.6), a
term due to the condition of s1 periodicity of the z2-odd step function i(). in the small

radius limit, the lorentz chern-simons forms contained in e1 and e2 become the same and

16

we can replace e1 +e2 by



1

(4)2 (3ym  3l) and (3.20) becomes

h = db 

2
2r2 (3ym  3l) .

(3.21)

upon reexpressing   11 in terms of the ten-dimensional gravitational coupling 10 and
rescaling the elds to ones favorite normalisations, one obtains the standard relation for the
heterotic string. in our case, 2

10, and we redene h and b according to

2r = 2

h =

2
10

2 bh,

b =

2
10

2 bb,

so that one obtains the standard relation of the heterotic string:

(3.22)

(3.23)

bh = dbb  3ym + 3l .

the gauge variation of bb can be directly obtained from its denition and the expression of

c, eq. (3.11). the result is as expected

with 3ym = d1

2ym and 3l = d1

2ym  1
2l,

bb = 1
2l. of course, bh is invariant.

it is easy to see how these relations are modied by the presence of ve-branes: an m-
2 ()(3)(w6,a)

theory ve-brane not wrapping s1 (with  = 1) only contributes a zero-mode 

to gabc,11. such a term then appears on the r.h.s. of (3.23) and dbh gets an extra term
 (4)(w6,a) which is the appropriate source term from a heterotic ns ve-brane.

to complete the comparison with the low-energy eective supergravity of the heterotic

string, we compute the einstein and yang-mills terms and the kinetic terms for bh using the
d3l = tr r2. of course, they should not be confused with the spin connection one-forms e1,e2 and e

 3ym and 3l are conventionally normalised chern-simons three-forms with d3ym = tr f 2

used some time ago.

this shows that lhet has two parameters, 10 and the expectation value of  (related to the
radius r of the circle), and that  cannot be observed in the heterotic limit.

4. anomaly cancellations

the z2 orbifold projection generates a chiral spectrum and, as a consequence, a chiral gauge,

mixed and gravitational quantum anomaly in m10 which can be characterized by a formal

twelve-form. we have seen that the modication of the bianchi identity is at the origin of a

well-dened gauge and lorentz variation of the three-form eld c. this variation will in turn

produce an anomalous variation of the action. we now study the sources for this anomaly

inow and prove anomaly cancellation. to begin with, we will not consider ve-branes. they

will be taken into account separately in sect. 4.4. in this section we still keep b as a parameter,

since from the m-theoretic point of view, the requirement b = 1 occurs in the rst place only

6= 0. even in the topological sector wherer ei4,i = 0 there are anomalies which need

to be cancelled. in any case we will nd that anomaly cancellation relates b2 to 6/4. in the
6= 0 and b = 1 this then xes the ratio 6/4. but this ratio should not
depend on the topological sector of the theory and this in turn will imply that b = 1 always.

(4.7)

since the eld g is real, the parameter b is real as well and b2 is necessarily positive, as is 4

so the sign of the coecient in i (top)
is xed. this reects the fact that n = 1 ten-dimensional
supersymmetry is chiral and specic signs appear in the bianchi identity once the gravitino

12

chirality is chosen. in any case, the above sign is as required to cancel the quantum anomaly

generated by chiral fermions.

it is quite amazing that the two so dierent looking anomalies s(1)

to the same anomaly twelve-form (apart from the dierent b-dependence). however, using

top and s(2)

the descent equations, as explained in appendix a, it is not dicult to explicitly nd a local

4.2. anomaly inflow from the green-schwarz term

2tr r4  1

we still have to determine the variation of the green-schwarz term r g  x7. here arises
the question whether one should take r g  x7 or r c  x8 with x8 = dx7 and x8 =
(4)3 12(cid:0) 1
8 (tr r2)2(cid:1) (cf. eq. (a.5) in the appendix). note that x8 obeys dx8 = 0
same steps withr c  x8 as above withr c  g  g we will show below that this form does
not allow to cancel the one-loop anomalies. the correct form is r g  x7. the appropriate

and x8 = 0. both choices are equivalent if g = dc, but dier at present. going through the

normalisation of this term is known independently [4, 5], but we will rederive it from the

present anomaly cancellation. let

anomaly cancellation. we conclude that bsgs could be suitable at best only for b = 0. but
discriminate between sgs and bsgs relies on the presence of the second term in (4.14) and this

this case is certainly ruled out as it would lead to stop = 0. note that the possibility to

term again is a consequence of enforcing periodicity of the step functions i().

4.3. cancellation of the one-loop anomaly

the sum i (top)
12 must cancel the one-loop anomaly given in the appendix, eq. (a.5).
(these expressions refer to ten-dimensional anomalies on a given xed plane and should be

12 + i (gs)

understood as involving only tilde quantities.) it is

i12(1loop) =xi (cid:16) 

3

(ei4,i )3 +ei4,i  ex8,i(cid:17) .

we get anomaly cancellation, i (top)

12 + i (gs)

12 + i12(1loop) = 0, if and only if

and

b2 =

c = 1 .

(4.15)

(4.16)

(4.17)

while c = 1 was known previously, from cancellation of the anomaly due to a ve-brane (see

below), earlier literature claims a cubic equation for the parameter b. instead, we have shown
here that a careful treatment of periodicity along s1 cancels the cubic terms and leads to a

quadratic relation.

using eqs. (4.9), (4.12) and (4.16) we may now rewrite the total anomalous variation as

stop + sgs =

(4.18)

note that the term  b is the variation of a local ten-dimensional counterterm, and this is why
it does not contribute to the twelve-form of the descent equations. we will see in section 6 that

22

in the small s1 radius limit corresponding to the perturbative heterotic string, this particular

form of the anomalous variation is at the origin of a local counterterm usually unexpected

from standard ten-dimensional arguments.

4.4. the five-brane anomaly

the same green-schwarz term (4.11) is also able to cancel any additional ve-brane anomaly



.

the latter is a purely gravitational anomaly of the six-dimensional chiral theory living on the

worldvolume of the ve-brane (a chiral tensor multiplet). the invariant eight-form correspond-

ing to this one-loop anomaly simply is

where the sign on the r.h.s actually depends on the choice of chirality. the bianchi identity

i 5brane
8

(1loop) = x8 ,

(4.19)

for g is further modied by the presence of the ve-brane as given by (3.7). recall that w6
denotes the ve-brane worldvolume and (5)(w6) is a ve-form such that for any six-form i6,
i6. (a possible switch of chirality would produce a minus sign on the

r.h.s. of (4.19) and (3.7).) then one sees immediately from (4.12) that there is an additional

rm11

ve-brane contribution to sgs:

(4.20)

we should still check that the new ve-brane contribution to dg does not spoil our previous

results. this is a crucial point which, to the best of our knowledge, has not been addressed at


the level of m-theory anomaly cancelling terms.

we will see that the result is quite non-trivial.

indeed, when solving the bianchi identity, g has an extra piece:

g|5brane = g|without vebrane + ()(4)(w6)

(4.21)

where d()(4)(w6) = (5)(w6). in section 3.1, we have explicitly given the form of ()(4)(w6)
for ve-branes not wrapping the circle, and later on in sect 3.3 we have shown that in this

 for ve-branes, there is also the normal bundle anomaly, but it can be taken care of independently [22]

and we will not consider it here.

 a discussion of anomaly cancellation in a calabi-yau background with ve-branes can be found in [23].

23

case the parameter  must be taken to be 1. for ve-branes that wrap the circle, (5)(w6)
does not contain  and any primitive ()(4)(w6) is allowed so far. for the time being we do
not specify which type of ve-branes we consider and thus we keep the more generic notation
()(4)(w6). what is important is that the extra piece in g does not depend on any elds and
is thus trivially gauge and local lorentz invariant. thus the variation c as given in (3.11) is

unchanged. the variation sgs is modied by the additional piece (4.20) as required. what
about stop =  1
contribution is due to the additional piece in g. we then get an additional piece in stop:

where we used (3.11) for c.

if the ve-brane wraps the circle, (5)(w6) and ()(4)(w6) are independent of  and then

the only -dependence of the above integrand is(cid:2)(b  1)i  b

2 d(cid:3) j which integrates to zero

by virtue of eqs. (2.11) and (2.14). hence the anomalous variation of stop is not aected by

these ve-branes.

if the ve-brane worldvolume does not extend in the -direction, things are more subtle.

we have seen that in this case necessarily b = 1 and  = 1. then using the explicit form of

(3.8) with  = 1 or eq. (3.17), eq. (4.22) becomes

is a non-vanishing contribution localised on the world volumes of the ve-branes:

which clearly is non-vanishing. this is an interesting new eect. a somewhat related issue

appears in [23] where it is found, within the context of calabi-yau compactications with less

supersymmetry, that there are gauge elds that originate on the ve-branes. the consequences

of the non-vanishing term (4.24) go beyond the scope of the present paper and will be discussed

elsewhere [16].

5. the issue of g-ux quantization

5.1. does flux quantization hold?

cancellation of all anomalies only required the validity of relation (4.16) between b2 and
6/4. to put it dierently, whatever the ratio 6/4 is, there is a choice of the parameter

b that cancels all anomalies. on the other hand, we have seen that if there are topologically
6= 0, one is forced to take b = 1 in
order to have a globally well-dened four-form eld g. we will now explore the consequences of

non-trivial gauge/gravity congurations such thatrc4ei4,i

this fact for the ux of g and compare with wittens result on ux quantization [14] obtained

in the downstairs approach which in a certain way also corresponds to a xed value of b.

we will evaluate the integral of g on the two dierent categories of four-cycles. to simplify

the discussion, we suppose that there are no ve-branes. modications due to the latter can

be trivially incorporated.

(5.1)

four-cycles not wrapping s1
consider a four-cycle c() not wrapping the s1 and at a xed value of   (0, ). then

g = bxi

i() zc() ei4,i = b(cid:18)1 

 zc() ei4,2 = b zc() ei4,1
shown in section 3.3, eitherrc()ei4,1 = 0 and b is arbitrary, orrc()ei4,1 = n1  1

where the -dependent terms have cancelled thanks to the cohomology condition (3.13). as
2 p1 6= 0 with



(cid:19) zc() ei4,1 

25

n1, p1  z in which case b = 1. in either case we get

1
2

p1(cid:19) = (cid:18)n2 

1
2

p2(cid:19) for any 4-cycle c not wrapping s1 .

(5.2)

usually one mentions another contribution to this integral which would come from the dc

piece in g. but with cabc = 0 there is no such contribution here.

this looks much like wittens ux quantization [14] which was obtained in the downstairs

approach and which reads

1

downstairsrc g = (cid:0)n1  1

2 p1(cid:1). although the two conditions seem

to dier by a factor of two, they are actually the same. the point is that the gravitational
couplings 2 in the upstairs and downstairs approach dier precisely by this factor of two [9]:
2
upstairs/2 and since  = (4)22/3 one also has downstairs = upstairs/2. of
downstairs = 2
course, in all our formulas   upstairs and one sees that eq (5.2) is exactly wittens ux
quantization. using eq. (4.16) with b = 1 one can reexpress this ux quantization with only

 or only  appearing as coecient, but this is not too illuminating.

four-cycles wrapping s1

we must also consider four-cycles of the form c = c3  s1 where c3 is some three-cycle at
xed value of . obviously, such cycles do not exist in the downstairs approach and we cannot

expect the corresponding ux to be related to wittens quantization condition. an arbitrary
four-cycle then is homologous to m1 times this four-cycle c plus m2 times any of the four-cycles
of the previous subsection. one has from eq. (3.6)

zc3s1

g = zc3s1  dc + xi (cid:20)(b  1)i 

b
2

d(cid:21) ei! = zc3s1

dc  zc3 xi ei .

(5.3)

as always when integrating over s1, the b-dependent terms have cancelled. this integral is

closely related to the uxr h =r (dbym +l) in the heterotic string. indeed, as discussed

in section 3.5, it exactly reduces to the latter in the small radius limit. the ux of h was

discussed some time ago [18] and it was concluded (when appropriately normalised) to be of
the form n +  with n  z,   r. a similar argument holds here and we conclude that the
value of (5.3) cannot be determined further. the key dierence with wittens analysis [14] is
that since g 6= dc one cannot use the standard argument to obtain ux quantization.

26

we conclude that for four-cycles not wrapping the circle s1 we have the standard ux
quantization, while if the four-cycle wraps the s1 we cannot say anything interesting about

the ux of g.

5.2. a remark on the membrane action

let us rst review the standard argument [14]. in uncompactied m-theory or m-theory on

a smooth manifold one simply has g = dc. since this needs not hold globally one typically
argues thatrc g =rc+ dc(+) +rc dc() =rc3
(c(+)  c()) where c3 = c+ = c. but
since the membrane action t2rc3
c + . . . (t2 is the membrane tension) should be well-dened
modulo 2 one concludes that t2rc g = 2n with integer n. witten has argued [14] that the
three-dimensional membrane theory does in certain cases have a so-called parity anomaly [17]
which is a sign ambiguity eip, p  z of the fermion determinant. this implies that actually
the well-denedness of the membrane functional integral requires t2rc g = 2(n  1
2p). this
ts with the ux quantization since t2 =  2
 . in our present upstairs discussion however,
this relation for the g-ux holds (with the appropriate redenition of 2 by a factor of two
as discussed above) if c does not wrap the s1, but is replaced by (5.3) if it does. does this
mean that the membrane functional integral is no longer well-dened? of course not. first,
the above argument is spoiled since g 6= dc everywhere. second, a coupling of c to the
c without modication certainly does not lead to

membrane worldvolume c3 of the typerc3

a well-dened functional integral since we have observed that c is neither gauge nor local

lorentz invariant. obviously then there must be corrective terms to restore the invariance. it

would be interesting to explicitly construct these terms. a clue is probably provided by eq.

(5.3) which is gauge and local lorentz invariant.

27

6. the heterotic anomaly-cancelling terms

as a last check of our scheme, we compute in the small-radius limit the anomaly-cancelling

terms of the heterotic string. taking the zero modes along the circle amounts to identifying

x8,i is given in the appendix. as before, bab is identied with the zero mode 1
cf. eq. (3.19), and cabc = 0 as usual. using eq. (3.6) (with an obvious insertion of a factor
of 1

er1 and er2 with r as well as the seven-form x7 in m11 with its restriction ex7,1  ex7,2  ex7
to m10 (no d components) and similarly for x8 = dx7 and ex8,1  ex8,2  ex8. we recall that

so that indeed bx7 veries dbx7 = bx8. note that our previous denitions ex7 and ex8 only had

have both, gravitational and gauge, as well as mixed contributions. with these denitions,

namely 

10(cid:17) with b = 1. as already explained in sect. 3.4, the

small-radius limit automatically produces this term with a coecient corresponding to b = 1.
the extra factor of 3
part of this term, namely  1
(6.5), leaving us with a factor of + 1

7. conclusions

we have carefully studied the solution for g of the modied bianchi identity.

it appeared

to depend on an arbitrary parameter b. when requiring g to be globally well-dened, i.e.

invariant under small and large gauge and local lorentz transformations we have discovered

that this parameter b is xed to b = 1 in all topologically non-trivial sectors of the theory (i.e.

with non-vanishing gauge/gravitational instanton numbers and/or with ve-branes) anomaly
cancellation equates b2 and 12
(4)5
sectors where b = 1 this xes 6

6
4 , independently of the choice of topological sector. in those
4 = (4)5
12 . since this ratio cannot depend on the topological

sector of the theory, anomaly cancellation in turn implies that b = 1 always.

thus anomaly cancellation and global well-denedness of g have selected exactly one

solution g to the modied bianchi identity. this is neither a consequence of ux quantization

nor has it anything to do with membrane actions. instead, we observe that for four-cycles not
wrapping s1, the ux of g indeed automatically obeys wittens ux quantization while for
cycles wrapping the s1 the ux is more general. also, in this s1/z2 orbifold for membranes
wrapping the s1 the naive membrane action is not gauge/local lorentz invariant and needs to

be modied.

we observed that b = 1 is also very natural when considering the reduction to the heterotic

string in the small radius limit, since it is only for b = 1 that all higher modes of the fourier

expansion on the circle can be consistently decoupled. we explicitly wrote out the anomaly

cancelling terms obtained from this reduction. they dier from what is usually taken in the

heterotic string by the addition of a well-dened local counterterm.

anomaly cancellations in the presence of ve-branes are more subtle: for ve-branes not

wrapping the circle there is an extra contribution from stop signalling that non-trivial things

are happening on those ve-branes.

it is quite amazing that this simple s1/z2 orbifold of m-theory still had that many subtle
points to be revealed. now that we understand them, it is relatively straightforward to study

other more complicated orbifolds of m-theory. this will be done elsewhere [16].

30

in this appendix, we give the relevant anomaly polynomials used in the paper. dierent authors

appendix a

have conventions diering by factors of 2, etc. . . we use the conventions of [20], which were
also used in the nice appendix of [13]. recall that an anomaly an in n dimensions, i.e.
polynomial in+2 in n + 2 dimensions
(a twelve-form in our ten-dimensional case) which is related to an by the descent equations
(a.1)

s =r dnxan, is described by a unique gauge-invariant

in+2 = din+1 ,



in+1 = dan .

s +r dnx n, so that an  a

recall that this is so because the anomaly an itself is not uniquely dened. indeed we always
have the freedom to add an n-dimensional local counterterm to the action s: s  s =
n = an + n + dn1, with an arbitrary n1. on the
other hand, the descent equations imply that in+1 is dened up to a dn. but then in+1
is dened up to a dn = dn meaning that an is only dened up to a n and a dn1
as it should. when one applies the descent equations to dierent ways of writing the same
invariant anomaly polynomial in+2 one is naturally led to dierent anomalies an and a
n, the
two diering by the gauge variation n of a local counterterm and possibly a total derivative

dn1.

the relevant contributions to the gauge, gravitational and mixed anomalies due to the

dierent chiral elds in ten dimensions are given by the following invariant twelve-forms of the

gauge and lorentz curvatures:

group: the gauge curvature two-form f has values in the adjoint representation. an additional

factor 1/2 must be included for majorana-weyl fermions, and opposite chiralities contribute

with opposite signs.

the one-loop anomaly generated by each of the s1/z2 xed planes includes an e8 gauge
(and mixed) contribution, and a gravitational contribution that is the half of what would be

expected in ten dimensions. this is because of the coupling of eleven-dimensional supergravity

to ten-dimensional elds [1]. a pragmatic way to understand this extra factor of one half is to

realise that, in the limit where the two xed planes coincide, the sum of the anomalies of the
two xed planes should reproduce the standard ten-dimensional e8  e8 anomaly. hence the
one-loop anomaly on the ith plane (i = 1, 2) for a general gauge group is

(a.3)

where the overall factor of 1
2 is due to the majorana-weyl condition and the extra factor of
1
2 in the gravitational term has just been explained. the dimension of the gauge group on
the ith plane is denoted by ni. note that r is meant to be located on the ith plane. in the
following, we write ri to emphasize this fact. such an anomaly has a chance to be cancelled by

an appropriate green-schwarz mechanism only if this twelve-form factorises into a four-form
and an eight-form. for this to work the tr r6 term must vanish and the tr f 6 term must be
expressible entirely as a combination of tr f 4 tr f 2 and (tr f 2)3. the rst condition selects
ni = 248 while the only appropriate factorisation of tr f 6 is obtained if

tr f 6

i =

7200

(tr f 2

i )3,

tr f 4

i =

1
100

(tr f 2

(a.4)

these two conditions only hold for e8, which also has the required dimension ni = 248. the

presence of large integers in the coecients is due to the large value 30 of the quadratic dynkin

index for the adjoint representation of e8. expressions become nicer if one redenes the trace

32

as tr = 30 tr . one then arrives at the factorised form

(a.5)

one sees that each of the i12(1loop)i, i = 1, 2 is factorised. for the perturbative e8 e8
heterotic string the relevant polynomial is the sum i12(1loop)1 + i12(1loop)2. how can this
also be factorised? for the perturbative limit (weak coupling) the two xed planes coincide

and one should take the same value for r in both expressions. then the purely gravitational

x8 is the same and one gets

i12(1loop)1 + i12(1loop)2  (i4,1 + i4,2)x8 +

= (i4,1 + i4,2)hx8 +



3(cid:16)(i4,1)3 + (i4,2)3(cid:17)
3(cid:16)(i4,1)2 + (i4,2)2  i4,1i4,2(cid:17)i ,



(a.6)

which is factorised thanks to the trivial identity a3 + b3 = (a + b)(a2 + b2  ab). it is now
easy to rewrite this expression in term of traces over the representations of the product group
e8  e8 to recover the well-known expression of the anomaly for e8  e8 super yang-mills
coupled to n = 1 supergravity (heterotic string). but we do not need it here.

we have chosen the normalisation of the four-forms i4,i such that their integrals over a

four-cycle equal the integral characteristic class of the e8 bundle minus a quarter of the even
rst pontryagin class. more precisely, for any four-cycle c4 one has
