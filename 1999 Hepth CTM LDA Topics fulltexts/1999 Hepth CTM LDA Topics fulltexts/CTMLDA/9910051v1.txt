i shall begin by summarizing the key results constituting conventional wisdom in stan-

dard quantum chromodynamics (qcd).

firstly, in vector-like gauge theories and in qcd in particular, non-chiral symmetries
such as sul+r(2)  sul(2)  sur(2) or sul+r(3)  sul(3)  sur(3) cannot be spon-
taneously broken. this is the vafa-witten result [1,2]. in qcd with large nc, coleman
and witten [3] showed that chiral symmetry is broken to diagonal u(nf ) and thus, if chiral
symmetry is broken, it must happen in such a manner that avor symmetry is preserved.
secondly, chiral sul(3)  sur(3) symmetry in qcd with massless u, d, s quarks must be
spontaneously broken. however, it is dicult to show [4] that chiral sul(2)  sur(2) sym-
metry in qcd with massless u, d quarks is also spontaneously broken. thirdly, qcd may
very well exhibit the higgs mode for the vector current and the goldstone mode for the
axial vector current i.e.,
the massless scalars arising from goldstone theorem get eaten
up by the gauge vector eld which consequently acquires a nite mass. this important
conjecture was introduced by georgi in 1989 who called it as a new realization of chiral
symmetry (vector mode ) since it involves both the wigner-weyl and nambu-goldstone
modes. this is georgis conjecture [5].

to quote weinberg [6], a recent paper of georgi, can be interpreted as proposing that
qcd at zero temperature is near a second order phase transition, at which the broken
chiral sul(3)  sur(3) symmetry has a (8, 1) + (1, 8) representation, consisting of the octet
of pseudoscalar goldstone bosons plus an octet of massless scalars, that on the broken
symmetry side of the phase transition, become the helicity-zero states of the massive vector
meson octet,   . it is intriguing and mysterious that at the second order phase transition
at which chiral sul(2)  sur(2) of massless qcd becomes unbroken , this symmetry may
become local with  and a1 as massless gauge bosons.

as a nal point one may observe that the charges corresponding to spontaneously broken
local gauge symmetries are screened and the vector mesons are massive. this is a mani-
festation of spontaneously broken local symmetries. for instance, the well-known example
[7] is the abelian higgs model:
in the spontaneously broken phase, the vector eld has a
nite mass (thus the eld is of nite range) and the conserved current does not have a total
charge in the physical hilbert space.

the nature of spontaneously broken chiral symmetry [8] is intimately connected to spon-
taneously broken scale invariance. it has been emphasized by adler [9] that there are two
examples of relativistic eld theories which exhibit spontaneously broken scale invariance
where chiral symmetry is also broken. these are johnson-baker-wiley model of quantum
electrodynamics [10] and asymptotically free gauge theories. this indeed may be a general
feature as we pointed out recently in our investigation [11] of spontaneously broken chiral
symmetry in qcd. let us review this connection briey.

unbroken scale invariance can be expressed as

where the dilatation charge is

qd(t)|0 > = 0,

qd(t) = z d3x d0(x, t),

dened in terms of d(x, t), the dilatation current. equivalently,

2

(1)

(2)

d|0 >= 0.

(3)

invoking colemans theorem [12], which is valid for continuous symmetries, we can then
prove that the divergence of the dilatation current itself must vanish identically:

d = 0.

(4)

on the other hand, it turns out that we know that the divergence of the dilatation current
is determined by the trace anomaly [13] in qcd:

d =

1
2

(g)

g

g

 g

 + xi

mi[1 + i()] ii,

(5)

where the second term vanishes for massless quarks in the chiral limit. consequently the
beta function must vanish. it is well-known that in an asymptotically free theory of qcd
which also exhibits connement, the behavior of (g) is such that it decreases as g increases
and never turns over. consequently g = 0 is the only possibility and hence the theory
reduces to triviality. we therefore conclude by reductio ad absurdum that scale invariance
must be broken spontaneously by the qcd vacuum state

qd(t)|0 > 6= 0 .

(6)

thus, scale invariance is broken both spontaneously by the vacuum state and explicitly by
the trace anomaly. consequently, the states obtained by successive repeated application of
qd(t) on the vacuum state are neither vacuum states nor are they necessarily degenerate.

let us now consider the commutator [11]

[qd(0), qa(0)] = idqqa(0)

(7)

which denes the scale dimension of the charge qa(0), the generators of vector su(n)
(the avor (non-chiral) group of qcd). eq.(7) may be promoted to arbitrary time by
introducing the operator eiht on the left, eiht on the right (and inserting the unit operator
1 = eiht eiht in the middle of the commutator on the left hand side):

[qd(t), qa(t)] = idqqa(t) .

(8)

it is important to point out that operator relations such as eq.(8) are unaected by spon-
taneous symmetry breaking, which is manifested in the properties of physical states, as
emphasized by weinberg [14].

i shall now proceed to establish that the avor vector charges, qa(t) = r d3x v 0

a are the conserved vector currents in qcd. (a = n 2

a (x, t), are
f  1,
a are conserved, the corresponding vector

screened, i.e., qa(t) = 0, where v 
where nf is the number of avors). since v 
charges qa(t) commute with h:

[qa(t), h] = 0,

(9)

where h is the hamiltonian (density), h = 00. eq.(9) implies that the following double
commutator also vanishes:

3

[qd(t), [qa(t), h] ] = 0,

(10)

where qd(t) is the dilation charge dened in eq.(2). let us now invoke the jacobi identity
to recast eq.(10):

[qa(t), [h, qd(t) ] ] + [h, [qd(t), qa(t)] ] = 0.

since

[h, qd(t)] = id(x, t) 6= 0,

(11)

(12)

by virtue of the trace anomaly, eq.(5), and the second double commutator on the left hand
side of eq.(11) vanishes in view of eqs.(8,9), we arrive at the important operator relation:

[qa(t), d(x, t) ] = 0 .

applying eq.(13) on the vacuum state, we obtain:

[qa(t), d(x, t) ]|0i = 0 .

we now invoke the vafa-witten result [1]

from eqs.(14,15), we conclude [15] that

qa(t)|0i = 0.

o(x, t)|0i  qa(t)d(x, t) |0i = 0

(13)

(14)

(15)

(16)

where the operator o is local in space and time [16]. consequently we can utilize the all-
powerful federbush-johnson theorem which applies to any local operator to conclude that

qa(t)d(x, t)  0

(17)

where d(x, t) is governed by the trace anomaly, [16].

since d(x, t) cannot vanish in qcd exhibiting both asymptotic freedom and con-
nement (except at g = 0 ), we are led to conclude that the vector charges are screened,
i.e., qa(t) = 0, proving georgis [5] conjecture: qcd at zero temperature exhibits chiral
symmetry in the nambu-goldstone mode (nf = 3) and the vector symmetry is realized in
the higgs mode (vector mode) in the sense conjectured by georgi, .e., the vector charges
qa are screened and the corresponding vector mesons become massive by devouring the
would-be scalar goldstone bosons which disappear from the physical spectrum. the key in-
gredients in this analysis are the vafa-witten theorem [1], the federbush-johnson theorem
[12] and the trace anomaly for the divergence of the dilation current [13]. some concluding
remarks are in order.

first of all, eq.(9) which is the local version expressing current conservation v a

 = 0
holds if the surface terms at innity can be neglected. this is, a posteriori, justied since
the vector charges qa(t) must annihilate the vacuum (vafa-witten theorem) and hence the
avor vector symmetry cannot be spontaneously broken (i.e., there are no scalar goldstone

4

bosonsto produce a long range interaction which would have resulted in a non-vanishing sur-
face term). secondly, it may be worthwhile amplifying the connection between the vanishing
of the vector charges, i.e., qa(t) = 0 and georgis conjecture. let us consider a massive
vector boson coupled to a conserved source (by construction). while in the massless case,
this is mandatory, in the massive case, one can choose the current to be conserved if one
so wishes. in such a case, clearly the charges can be non-vanishing, even though the cor-
responding particle is massive. but the essential point here is that if the charges vanish,
qa(t) = 0, the vector meson cannot be massless: it must be massive ! this is the desired
connection with georgis conjecture.

finally, there are unresolved issues with the vector limit advocated by georgi, such as
its compatibility with lattice results and the question as to why arent the pions also eaten
up by the axial vector a1s ? these issues remain to be resolved, perhaps, in a future
publication.

i am indebted to p. narayana swamy for numerous conversations on the perennial topic
of chiral symmetry and for our previous eorts in trying to nail down georgis conjecture.

[15] it is worth pointing out that it would be fallacious to conclude from eq.(16) that

d |0i = 0.

[16] for our purpose, a local operator o(x) is one transforming locally under poincare trans-
formations and commuting with itself for space-like separations. it is straightforward

6

to verify the latter assertion by using eq.(13) in conjunction with qa(t) = qa(t), since
qa(t) is time independent and by invoking the assumed locality of d .
