abstract

considering a class of (2,0)-super yang-mills multiplets that ac-

commodate a pair of independent gauge potentials in connection

with a single symmetry group, we present here their coupling to

ordinary matter and to non-linear -models in (2,0)-superspace.

the dynamics and the coupling of the gauge potentials are dis-

cussed and the interesting feature that comes out is a sort of chi-

rality for one of the gauge potentials once light-cone coordinates

are chosen.

the raise of interest on the investigation of geometrical aspects and quan-

tum behaviour of two-dimensional systems, such as yang-mills theories and

non-linear -models, especially if endowed with supersymmetry, has been

broadly renewed in connection with the analysis of superstring background

congurations [1, 2] and the study of conformal eld theories and integrable

models.

as for supersymmetries dened in two space-time dimensions, they may

be generated by p left-handed and q right-handed independent majorana

charges: these are the so-called (p, q) supersymmetries [1, 3] and are of fun-

damental importance in the formulation of the heterotic superstrings [4].

motivated by the understanding of a number of features related to the

dynamics of world-sheet gauge elds [5] and the possibility of nding new

examples of conformal eld theories, was considered the superspace formu-

lation of a (2, 0) yang-mills model [6, 7] enlarged by the introduction of an

extra gauge potential transforming under the same simple gauge group as

the ordinary yang-mills eld of the theory.

in the works of refs.[6, 7] one has discussed the role of the further gauge

potential on the basis of discussing constraints on eld-strength superelds in

the algebra of gauge-covariant derivatives in (2, 0)-superspace. the minimal

coupling of this sort of less-constrained yang-mills model to matter super-

elds has been contemplated, and it has been ascertained that the additional

gauge potential corresponds to non-interacting degrees of freedom in the

abelian case. for non-abelian symmetries, the extra yang-mills eld still

decouples from matter, though it presents self-interactions with the gauge

sector [6].

2

it is therefore our purpose in this letter to nd out a possible dynamical

role for the aditional gauge potential discussed in refs.[6, 7], by means of its

coupling to matter superelds that describe the coordinates of the kahler

manifold adopted as the target space of a (2, 0) non-linear -model [8]. to

pursue such an investigation, we shall gauge the isometry group of the -

model under consideration while working in (2, 0)-superspace; then, all we are

left with is the task of coupling the (2, 0) yang-mills extended supermultiplets

of ref.[6] to the superelds that dene the (2, 0) -model that is gauged.

the coordinates we choose to parametrise the (2, 0)-superspace are given

by

za  (x++, x; , ),

(1)

where x++, x denote the usual light-cone coordinates, whereas ,  stand

for complex right-handed weyl spinors. the supersymmetry covariant deriva-

tives are taken as:

and

d+   + i++

d+   + i++,

(2)

(3)

where ++ (or ) represents the derivative with respect to the space-time

coordinate x++ (or x). they fulll the algebra:

d2

+ = d2

+ = 0

{d+, d+} = 2i++,

with this denition for d and d, one can check that:

ei +d+ei + = 

3

(4)

(5)

ei + d+ei + = 

(6)

the fundamental matter superelds we shall deal with are the chiral

scalar and left-handed spinor supereld, whose respective component-eld

expressions are given by:

(x; , ) = ei ++( + )

(x; , ) = ei ++( + )

(7)

where  and  are scalars, whereas  and  respectively right and left-handed

weyl spinors.

this sort of chirality constraints yields the following component-eld ex-

pansions for i and i:

i(x; , ) = i(x) + i(x) + i ++i(x),

i(x; , ) = i(x) + i(x) + i ++i(x).

(8)

the most general superspace action involving  and  with interactions

governed by dimensionless coupling parameters 1 and 2, reads

s = z d2xdd[i(    ) +  +

+ m( + ) +

+ 1p (, )(    ) +

+ 2q(, ) ],

(9)

where m is a mass parameter, and p and q denotes real polynomials in 
and .

4

we now assume that  and  transform under an arbitrary compact and

simple gauge group, g, according to

 = r(),

 = s()

(10)

where r and s are matrices that respectively represent a gauge group el-

ement in the representation under which  and  transform. taking into

account the constraint on  and , and bearing in mind the exponencial

representation of r and s, we nd that the gauge paramenter superelds 

satisfy the same sort of constraint. it can therefore be expanded as follows:

(x; , ) = ei ++( + ),

(11)

where  is a scalar and  is a right-handed spinor.

the kinetic part of the action (9) can be made invariant under the lo-

cal transformations (10) by minimally coupling gauge potential superelds,
(x; , ) and v (x; , ) according to

sinv = z d2xdd{i[ ehv ()  ()ehv ] + ehv }.

(12)

the yang-mills supermultiplets are introduced by means of the gauge

covariant derivatives which, according to the discussion of ref. [6], are dened

as below:

+  d+ + +,

+  d+,

(13)

++  ++ + ++

and

    ig,

(14)

where the gauge superconnections +, ++ and  are all lie-algebra-

valued. the gauge coupling g and h could in principle be taken dierent. +

5

and ++ can be both expressed in terms of a real scalar supereld, v (x; , ),

according to:

and

+ = egv (d+egv )

++ = 

i
2

d+[egv (d+egv )].

(15)

(16)

therefore, the gauging of the -model isometry group shall be achieved by

minimally coupling the action of the (2, 0)-supersymmetric -model to the

gauge superelds v and , as we shall see in the sequel.

to stablish contact with a component-eld formulation and to actually

identify the presence of an aditional gauge potential, we write down the -

expansions for v and :

v (x; , ) = c +     +  v++

(17)

and

(x; , ) =

1
2

(a + ib) + i( + i) + i( + i) +

 (m + in).(18)

a, b and v++ are the light-cone components of the gauge potential

elds; , ,  and  are left-handed majorana spinors; m, n and c are real

scalars and  is a complex right-handed spinor.

the gauge transformations of the component elds above read

c =

(19)

and they suggest that we can take h = g, so the component v++ should be

identied as the light-cone partner of a,

v++  a++,

(20)

and we end up with two component-eld gauge potentials: a  (a0, ai) and
b(x). at this point, we should set a non-trivial remark: the  -component

of  should be identied as bellow:

m + in = i++(a + ib),

(21)

so as to ensure that f  a a appears as a component accomodated

in the eld-strength supereld dened by:

[+, ]  x = igd+ + +.

(22)

7

this does not break supersymmetry, for  and  are non-dynamical degrees

of freedom and drop out from the eld-strength supereld x. in practice,

after the identication given in equation (21),  carries two bosonic and

two fermionic degrees of freedom.

using the eld-strength dened in (22), we can build up the gauge invari-

ant kinetic lagrangian:

skin = 

1

8g2 z d2xdd xx.

(23)

this action leads to the component lagrangian as below:

lkin = lkin(, , ) + lkin(a) + lkin(b, c)

(24)

where

and

lkin(, , ) =

i

(  i  

)++( + i  ),

lkin(a) =

(25)

(26)

lkin(b, c) =

1
8

(++b  ++c)2 =

1
8

(b c)k(b c)t.

(27)

notice that, as already mentioned above,  and  are not present in the

kinetic lagrangian (25).

we can see that r and k are non-invertible matrices, so it is necessary

to write down the gauge xing lagrangian which is given by:

sgf = k z d2xdd gg
(a)2 

=

8

i
4

(  i   )++( + i  ) +



(++b + ++c)

(28)

where g = d+v  id+. using the gauge xing, eq.(28), together

with equations (26) and (27), we can write down the propagators for a, b

and c:

haai = 

hbbi =

( + ),

2i

8i
2 (  1)2
8i
2 ( + 1),

hbci = hcbi =

hcci =

8i
2 (  1)

(29)

expressing the action of equation 12 in terms of component-elds, and adopt-

ing the wess-zumino gauge, the lagrangian reads as bellow:

lcomp = 2  iga[++  c.c] + iga++[  c.c] +

+ g[++a + ga++a] + 2i  ga +

+ ig[( +  + i  i)  c.c]

(30)

one immediately checks that the extra gauge eld b does not decouple

from the matter vector. our point of view of leaving the superconnection

 as a complex supereld naturally introduced an extra gauge potential,

b in addition to the usual gauge eld a. b behaves as second gauge

eld. the fact that its massless pole is of order two may harm the unitarity.

however, the mixing with the c-component of v , which is a compensating

eld, indicates us that we should couple them to external currents and analyse

the imaginary part of the current-current amplitude at the pole. in so doing,

this imaginary part turns out to be positive-denite, and so no ghosts are

present. this insures us to state that b behaves as a physical gauge eld.

9

it has dynamics and couples to matter. the only peculiarity regards the

presence of a single component in the light-cone coordinates. the b-eld

plays rather the role of a chiral gauge potential. despite the presence of

the pair of gauge elds, a gauge-invariant mass term cannot be introduced

since b does not present the b++-component, contrary to what happens with

a. let us now turn to the coupling of the two gauge potentials, a and

b, to the non-linear -model.

it is our main purpose henceforth to carry out the coupling of a (2, 0) -

model to the relaxed gauge superelds of the ref. [6], and show that the extra

degrees of freedom do not decouple now from the matter elds (that is the

target space coordinates). the extra gauge potential obtained upon relaxing

constraints can therefore acquire a dynamical signicance by means of the

coupling between the -model and the yang-mills elds of ref.[6]. moreover,

this system might provide another example of a gauge invariant conformal

eld theory.

the (2, 0)-supersymmetric -model action written in (2, 0)-superspace

reads [8]:

s = 

i

2 z d2xdd(cid:20)ki(, )i  c.c.(cid:21),

(31)

where the target space vector ki(, ) can be expressed as the gradient of a
real scalar (kahler) potential, k(, ), whenever the wess-zumino term is

absent (i.e., torsion-free case) [1]:

ki(, ) = ik(, ) 


i k(, ).

(32)

we shall draw our attention to kahlerian target manifolds of the coset

type, g/h. the generators of the isometry group, g, are denoted by q( =

10

1, ..., dimg), whereas the isotropy group, h, has its generators denoted by

q (  = 1, ..., dimh). the transformations of the isotropy group are linearly
realised on the superelds  and , and act as matrix multiplication, just

like for at target manifolds. the isometry transformations instead are non-

linear, and their innitesimal action on the points of g/h can be written

as:

and

i = ki

()

 i = ki(),

(33)

(34)

where ki and ki are respectively holomorphic and anti-holomorphic killing

vectors of the target manifold. the nite versions of the isometry transfor-

mations above read:

and

with

i = exp(l.k)i

i = exp(l

.k) i

l.ki  (cid:20)ki





j , i(cid:21)= i.

(35)

(36)

(37)

though the kahler scalar potential can always be taken h-invariant,

isometry transformations induce on k a variation given by:

k = [(ik)ki + ( ik)ki] = [() + ( )],

(38)

11

where the holomorphic and anti-holomorphic functions  and  can be

determined up to a purely imaginary quantity as below:

and

(ik)ki

   + im(, )

( ik)ki    im(, ).

(39)

(40)

the real functions m, along with the holomorphic and anti-holomorphic

functions  and , play a crucial role in discussing the gauging of the

isometry group of the target manifold [9, 10]. therefore, by virtue of the
transformation (38) and the constraints imposed on  and , it can be

readily checked that the superspace action (31) is invariant under global

isometry transformations.

proceeding further with the study of the isometries, a relevant issue in the

framework of (2, 0)-supersymmetric -models is the gauging of the isometry

group g of the kahlerian target manifold. this in turn means that one

should contemplate the minimal coupling of the (2, 0)--model to the yang-

mills supermultiplets of (2, 0)-supersymmetry [11]. an eventual motivation

for pursuing such an analysis is related to the 2-dimensional conformal eld

theories.

it is known that 2-dimensional -models dene conformal eld

theories provided that suitable constraints are imposed upon the target space

geometry [1, 2]. now, the coupling of these models to the yang-mills sector

might hopefully yield new conformal eld theories of interest.

the study of (2, 0)-supersymmetric yang-mills theories has been carried

out in ref.[11] and the gauging of -model isometries in (2, 0)-superspace has

12

been considered in ref.[12]. on the other hand an alternative less constrained

version of (2, 0) gauge multiplets has been proposed and discussed in refs.[6,

7]. it has been shown that the elimination of some constraints on the gauge

superconnections and on eld-strength superelds leads to the appearence

of an extra gauge potential that shares a common gauge eld. nevertheless,

this extra potential is shown to decouple from the (2, 0)-matter superelds

whenever they are minimally coupled to the yang-mills sector.

to write down the local version of the isometry transformations (33)

and (34), we have to replace the global parameter  by a pair of chiral and
antichiral superelds, (x; , ) and (x; , ), by virtues of the constraints
satised by  and . this can be realised according to:

and



i = exp(l.k)i



i = exp(l .k) i.

(41)

(42)

in order to get closer to the case of global transformations, and to express

all gauge variations exclusively in terms of the supereld parameters , we
propose a eld redenition that consist in replacing  by a new supereld,
, as it follows:

i  exp(il

v.k) i.

(43)

from the expression for the gauge transformation of the prepotential v , it

can be shown that:

exp(il

v .k) = exp(l

.k)exp(il

v.k)exp(l k),

(44)

13

and i consequently transform with the gauge parameter :



i = exp(l

k) i,

which innitesimally reads:

 i = (x;  )ki( ).

(45)

(46)

now, an innitesimal isometry transformation induces on the modied

kahler potential, k(, ), a variation given by:

where

k(, ) = ( + ),

 = ( ik)ki( ) + im(, ),

(47)

(48)

with  denoting a partial derivative with respect to . the isometry variation

k computed above reads just like a kahler transformation and is a direct
consequence of the existence of the real scalar m(, ), as discussed in refs

[9, 10].

the form of the isometry variation of k(, ) suggest the introduction
of a pair of chiral and antichiral superelds, () and ( ), whose respec-

tive gauge transformations are xed in such a way that they compensate

the change of k under isometries. this can be achieved by means of the

lagrangian dened as:

l = i[k(, )  ()  ( )]i +

 i[k(, )  ()  ( )] i,

(49)

14

where the covariant derivatives i and  i are dened in perfect

analogy to what is done in the case of the bosonic -model:

i  i  g

ki



and

 i   i  g



ki( ).

(50)

(51)

finally, all we have to do in order that the lagrangian l given above be

invariant under local isometries is to x the gauge variations of the auxiliary
scalar superelds  and . if the latter are so chosen that:

and

(i)ki

() = ()

( i )ki( ) = ( ),

then it can be readily veried that the kahler-transformed potential

[k(, )  ()  ( )]

(52)

(53)

(54)

is isometry-invariant, and the lagrangian l of eq. (49) is indeed symmetric

under the gauged isometry group.

the interesting point we would like to stress is that the extra gauge

degrees of freedom accommodated in the component-eld b(x) of the su-

perconnection  behave as a genuine gauge eld that shares with a the

coupling to matter and to -model [6]. this result can be explicitly read

15

o from the component-eld lagrangian projected out of the supereld la-

grangian l. we therefore conclude that our less constrained (2, 0)-gauge

theory yields a pair of gauge potentials that naturally transform under the

action of a single abelian gauge group.
