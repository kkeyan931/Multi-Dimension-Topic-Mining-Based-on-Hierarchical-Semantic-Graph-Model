(2) hc canonical hamiltonian, {a1 0} (rst class) primary constraints. innitesimal gauge transformation phase-space function f (q, p) given f =  (3) summation repeated indices henceforth implied. note gauge parameters appear outside poisson bracket. principle could included gauge parameters inside poisson bracket. dierent denitions weakly equivalent. result algebra  = v b b  = c c abc (4) (5) weak equivalence continues true poisson brackets f either canonical hamiltonian hc generator g. since analysis involves algebra, inconsequential whether gauge parameters 3 kept inside outside poisson bracket. structure functions c c ab v b general depend phase space variables. notice action principle leads euler-lagrange equations motion, requires commutativity general variation time-dierentiation. commutativity need hold arbitrary variation within hamiltonian framework. since motivation ab- stract symmetries action, impose dt qi = dt qi ; = 1, ....n.
