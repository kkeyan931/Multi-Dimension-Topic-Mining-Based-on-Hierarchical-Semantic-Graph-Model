abstract. the quantized magnetic ux  = 4 n (sign ), n = 0, 1, . . . of non-
topological vortices in the non-relativistic chern-simons theory is related to the topological
degree of the s 2  s 2 mapping dened by lifting the problem to the riemann spheres. reg-
ular solutions with nite degree only arise for rational functions, whose topological degree,
n , is the commun number of their zeros and poles on the riemann sphere, also called their
algebraic order.

a striking feature of non-relativistic chern-simons vortices [1] is the quantization of

their magnetic ux,

(1)

vortex ux = zr2

b d2~x = 4 n (sign ),

n = 0, 1, . . .

in gauge theories, similar properties are usually related to topology. yangmillshiggs
theories (1), for example, support niteenergy monopole solutions [2]. for large r, the
higgs eld is required to satisfy tr ()2 = 1 rather then to vanish. this asymptotic
condition allows us to view  as a mapping from the two-sphere at innity, s  s2
, into
the vacuum manifold tr ()2 = 1, which is again a two-sphere. then the magnetic charge
of the monopole is expressed [3] as

(2)

monopole charge =

ijkabcajbkc d2s.

the r. h. s. here is a topological invariant characterized by an integer. it is in fact

the homotopy class (or winding number) of , []  2(s2)  z.

non-relativistic chern-simons vortices are, however, non-topological : for niteenergy
solutions the particle density, , tends to zero when spatial innity is approached. then
where does ux quantization, eq. (1), come from ?

to answer this question, let us remember that, owing to the eld-current identity
which relates the magnetic eld to the particle density, b = , the magnetic ux of the
vortex is

(3)

vortex ux = 

1

 zr2

 d2~x.

here, apart of the zeros,  is a solution of the liouville equation  log  = (2/||).
now the general solution of the liouville equation is expressed using an arbitrary analytic
function f (z),

(4)

so that

the point is that the r. h. s. has the same topological interpretation as (2) for mono-
poles. the analytic function f can in fact be viewed as mapping the z-plane into the w-
plane. compactifying these planes into riemann spheres sz  c{} and sw  c{},

(1) we assume, for simplicity, that the gauge group is su(2).

z and w become stereographic coordinates. if f admits a welldened (nite or innite)
limit as r  , it can be extended into a mapping from s  sz into sw we still denote
by f . the extended mapping has a winding number, given in (2). this latter is in fact
the integral of the pull-back by f of , the surface form of the unit sphere sw,

(6)

charge =

4 zs

f .

now, in complex coordinate w, the surface element of sw is

(7)

 = 2i

dw  dw
(1 + ww)2 ,

so that setting w = f (z) in eq. (6) yields precisely the r. h. s. of (5), as stated.

in a previous paper [4] we proved that the regularity of niteux solutions excludes
essential singularities in the nite domain as well as at innity. an analytic function whose
only singularities in the extended plane are poles is known to be a rational function,

(8)

f (z) =

amzm + . . . + a1z + a0
bnzn + . . . + b1z + b0

.

[5]. but a rational function has always a limit at innity, namely   sw if m > n, 0  sw
if m < n and am/bm 6= 0,  if m = n. in the rst case,   sz is a pole of order m  n
while in the second it is a zero of order n  m. since the only other poles and zeros are
the n zeros of the denominator and the m zeros of the numerator, respectively, we see that
the extended map f : sz  sw has the same number of zeros and poles, namely n =
max(m, n). this commun number is called the algebraic order of the rational map f [5].

the magnetic charge (2) has another useful desciption [3]. the r. h. s. of (2) is in
fact equal to the topological (or brouwer) degree of the eld . chosing coordinates on the
spheres, the mapping  can be characterized by a(),  = (b) a, b = 1, 2. a point 0 in

the imagesphere is a regular point if det(cid:0)a/b) 6= 0). then the topological degree is

the number of pre-images of a regular point 0

(9)

degree = x0

sign det(cid:16) a
b (cid:17).

eq. (9) counts the number of times the imagetwosphere is covered while the domain
twosphere is covered once. then, assuming that  and 0 are regular points, the topolog-
ical degree of the rational function (8) is simply the number of zeros or, equivalently, the
number of poles. thus, we have proved

theorem1. the magnetic ux of the vortex solution associated with the rational function
f is (1), where n is the algebraic order of f .

the same result was obtained in ref. [4] by a rather laborious direct calculation.
let us also remark that the vortex number could also be identied with the rst chern

class of an u(1) principal bundle over the twosphere.

the correspondence between analytic functions f and solutions  of the liouville
equation is not onetoone, though. let r denote an arbitrary rotation of the image
twosphere sw. then f and rf yield the same solutions. this is seen by noting that
the particle density is in fact the dual on the two-sphere s  sz of the two-form f ,

 = (cid:0)f (cid:1). but

(cid:0)rf(cid:1)

 = f (cid:0)r(cid:1) = f ,

because the surfaceform  is symmetric w. r. t. rotations, r = . there is hence no
loss of generality in requiring that

(10)

f () = 0,

since this can always be achieved by a rotation of sw. a rational function which satises
the condition (10) can be written as

(11)

f (z) =

p (z)
q(z)

,

deg p < deg q

whose order is n = deg q. such an f depends on the 2n complex parameters, namely
the coecients of the polynomials p (z) and q(z). thus, we have proved

theorem2. for xed magnetic ux, the solution solution depends on 4n real parameters.

requiring f () =  instead of (10), the role of poles and zeros would be interchanged,

without changing the conclusion.

theorem2 is again consistent with previous results, [4], [6]. the particular form (11)
was reached in ref.
[4] by exploiting the invariance of the solution by f  (1/f ) when
m > n in (8), and by reducing the case m = n to (11) by a suitable redenition. these
transformations correspond simply to o(3) transformations which interchange poles and
zeros or rotate a point 6= 0,  into the origin, respectively.

let us note, in conclusion, that our result also applies to the o(3) sigma model which
describes a two-dimensional ferromagnet [7]. the scalar eld  is here a mapping from
the plane into a two-sphere s2. for large distances, all magnets are required to be aligned
so that () = 0  s2. this allows to extend  into a mapping between two-spheres.
the self-dual solutions found by belavin and polyakov [7] are associated with analytic
functions on the complex plane with identical properties as here above.
