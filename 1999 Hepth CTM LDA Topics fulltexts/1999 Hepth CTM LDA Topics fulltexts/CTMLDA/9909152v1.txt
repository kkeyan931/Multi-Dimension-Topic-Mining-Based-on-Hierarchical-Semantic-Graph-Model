1 introduction

the relation between yang-mills theories and string theories has been a leit-
motif in particle physics ever since mandelstam[1] rst noted the signicance
of wilson loops as observables in yang-mills theories[2, 3, 4, 5]. schwinger-
dyson equations satised by wilson loop observables in the gauge theory
were found to have natural interpretations in terms of geometric operations
on strings, such as string splitting and joining[3]. with n the rank of the
gauge group u(n) in the yang-mills theory, the topological classication of
feynman diagrams in the t hooft large n limit[6] in yang-mills theory gave
a further reason for expecting that strings should have some signicance in
gauge theories. in this limit the power of n 2 accompanying a given feyn-
man diagram depends only on the topology of the surface dened by the
double line representation of that diagram. the schwinger-dyson loop equa-
tions in the large n limit also simplifystrings can no longer join, and the
equations are satised by the expectation values which factorize in this limit.
the adscft conjecture[7] gives a geometric picture of the large n
limit of maximally supersymmetric yang-mills theory in four dimensions. in
a sense made precise in [8, 9] it is equal to the classical type iib supergravity
theory compactied on ads5  s5. for nite n the correspondence is rather
unclear. a natural extension of the large n conjecture to nite values of n
would be that the supergravity theory should be replaced by string theory
on a background with the appropriate isometry group at nite n. given
that the yang-mills theory is perfectly well-dened at any value of n and
string theory on ads5  s5 seems quite dicult to construct, it has been
suggested that the yang-mills theory is as good a denition of string theory
on ads5  s5 as one is likely to obtain.

what of the wilson loops that initiated the quest for a string description
of yang-mills theory in the rst instance? there is a natural string theory
canonically dened by the yang-mills theory as follows[10]: dene the loop

here h. . .i denotes correlation functions in the yang-mills theory dened by a
functional integral weighted by the action of the yang-mills theory, s. this
operator h turns out to be the fokker-planck hamiltonian[11] in parisi-wu
stochastic quantization[12] of the yang-mills theory. this means introducing
an additional euclidean dimension with a coordinate  (called the stochastic
time).
in this enlarged coordinate space, an auxiliary classical stochastic
theory is dened. the hamiltonian for evolution in the  direction of this
auxiliary theory is just the operator h. correlation functions of wilson loops
in the yang-mills theory are given by boundary correlations of the auxiliary
theory:

w (ci)i = lim
 

hh0| exp( h)yi

w (ci)|0ii,

(3)

where |0ii denotes the ground state of the hamiltonian h. one now identies
the fokker-planck hamiltonian[13] with a hamiltonian of a noncritical string
eld theory in a very special gauge[14]temporal gaugewhere the time ( )
is identied with the liouville degree of freedom. we say more about the
string interpretation in our concluding comments.

we see therefore that the wilson loops and their schwinger-dyson equa-
tions of motion responsible for motivating a string interpretation of yang-
mills theory are also at the root of a direct identication of a string eld
theory from the gauge theory.

2 truncation of the spectrum

kaluza-klein(kk) modes on s5 are associated with chiral primary operators
in the supersymmetric yang-mills theory, which are nite in number at nite
n, due to simple matrix identities. one particularly interesting aspect of the
adscft correspondence is that it therefore implies that a priori indepen-
dent excitations of the dual string theory cannot be independent. however,
the perturbative fundamental string does not know about the integrality of
n.

the aim of this paper is to exhibit the corresponding dynamical trunca-
tion phenomenon directly in the string theories constructed as above from

2

yang-mills theories. we shall show that the string hamiltonian exhibits a
quantization of the string coupling (in our case it is just 1/n 2) and a coupling
constant dependent truncation of the spectrum of a single string, phenomena
that are invisible in string perturbation theory to any order.

the simplest model of the noncritical string theoryyang-mills theory

correspondence is the one-plaquette model

z = z du exp(cid:16)(n/)trhu + u i(cid:17) .

(4)

in our notation tr is the usual trace and tr  tr/n. let {t} be a normalized
anti-hermitian orthonormal basis for the lie algebra of u(n) and h  ht.
as usual from the translation invariance of the u(n) haar measure, we can
derive schwinger-dyson equations for wilson loops

i creates tru i in the correlation function, [aj, a

0  1. thus
we see explicitly the weighting of joining interactions with a factor of 1/n 2,
while splitting interactions are o(1), keeping xed the expectation value
hw (c)i = o(1) in the large n limit. while h is not hermitian, it is related
to a hermitian hamiltonian by a similarity transformation as usual[12].

i ] = i,j, a

the raison detre of h is to reproduce the schwinger-dyson equations. in
deriving h there is an implicit assumption that the 1/n 2 is treated perturba-
tively, since no relationship between traces of matrices is taken into account.

3

of course, at nite n there are simple identities relating traces. if one wants
to take these identities into account the derivation of the appropriate hamil-
tonian is much more dicult[4] even though the identities in eq. 5 are still
valid. a priori it is not clear that h is suitable for nite n.

while h certainly does reproduce formally the schwinger-dyson equa-
tions, it is also crucial for the existence of the stochastic quantization that
h should have a unique ground state. in perturbation theory in 1/n 2 this
is obvious. our aim is now to consider what happens at nite values of n.
we will show that requiring a unique vacuum and no negative energy states
implies relationships among the a priori independent creation operators, and
that n be an integer. these relations exactly enforce the known identities
between traces of powers of matrices.

we rst consider a limit where this analysis simplies. a very important
feature of this string eld theory hamiltonian is that the string splitting and
joining terms are independent of the choice of the gauge theory action. only
the  dependent terms, which generate deformations of loops and annihilation
of small loops, depend on s. in a precise sense, the choice of s is equivalent
to the choice of a background in which the strings propagate. let us dene
h  lim h. then
exp

thus a background, in this model, amounts to a coherent state of wilson
loops. on this background other wilson loops propagate using the hamil-
tonian h.

let us start with the case  = . the total winding number of the
wilson loops in the correlation function is preserved by h. acting with h
on a state with only positive windings will only produce states with positive
windings, and the same is true for states with purely negative windings. we
shall begin with this case. later we shall consider states with positive and
negative winding strings. we compute rst in the winding number w = 2
sector. there are two states a

wound wilson line and a product of two singly wound wilson lines. in this
sector

this has a negative eigenvalue for n = 2, a zero eigenvalue for n = 3 and
only positive eigenvalues for n > 3. the eigenvalues in a sector with winding
number w are of the form w  (m/n) where m is an integer. for example,
for w = 2, m = 2, for w = 3, m = 0, 6 and for w = 4, m = 0, 4, 12. the
eigenvalue of interest for a given value of n is the largest value of m, which
is w(w  1).

the pattern evident in these examples continues: for a given value of n,
hw has a vanishing eigenvalue when w = n + 1, and negative eigenvalues
if w > n + 1. we see therefore that the stochastic quantization of h is ill-
dened as it stands. at the rst level we demand that the vacuum is unique
so we impose (for n = 2) v3 = 0, i.e. we demand the identity

(9)

this is just the 2  2 matrix identity

tru 3 = 3tru 2tru  2(tru)3.

we see that this relation is encoded in the hamiltonian automatically.

if this is a constraint it has to be compatible with time evolution. for
 =  this is trivial in the w = 3 sector. however, if we want now to go to

5

the w = 4 sector (keeping n = 2) we must check the consistency of imposing
this constraint on those states. looking at states with w = 4 at n = 2 the
consistency condition is

valid for 2  2 matrices.

where []+ means we normal order the terms and keep only terms with creation
operators, and o4  a
1 . we found a vanishing eigenvalue
at w = 3 when n = 2. for a unique vacuum, we must impose the constraint
v3  o3|0ii = 0, and since hv3 = [h, o3]|0ii = 0, we have exp(h )v3 = 0
for any . however, this is not enough for consistency. we must also ensure
that

2 +4a4

exp(h )o3yi

a
ni|0ii = 0

for all choices of ni and any . for example, this implies exp(h )o3a
0 for all . we must have

1|0ii =

1i+
hh, o3a

|0ii = hh, o3a

1i |0ii = 0,

6

which is precisely a linear combination of the new constraint o4|0ii = 0
and the initial constraint o3a
1|0ii = 0. we cannot stop here. clearly,
exp( h)o4|0ii = 0 must be true for all  as well so we compute

[h, o4]|0ii = 2o4|0ii.

(13)

thus, as desired, o4|0ii = 0 can be maintained without further constraints.
this procedure proceeds recursively. it is important that at each winding
number w we get only one constraint.

one can work out the constraints for positive and negative windings in-
dependently. it appears to be possible to implement all these constraints for
any value of n (not necessarily an integer) as long as we do not consider
states with positive and negative windings. however, explicit calculations
show that the constraints are only valid on all states when n is an integer.
as an example consider a

1o3|0ii. for general n

o3(n) = a

3  (3n/2)a

satises ho3(n)|0ii = (3  6/n)o3(n)|0ii. we then nd

[h, a

1o3]|0ii = (4  6/n)a

1o3(n)|0ii +

3
n 2 (n  2)(a

2 + na2

1 )|0ii. (14)

thus, only when n = 2 is the constraint a
the time evolution dened by h.

1o3(n)|0ii = 0 consistent with

we now take  to be nite. h does not preserve winding number so time
evolution takes us out of the winding sector we started with, so we need to
check that the constraints are satised under this dierent time evolution.
this can be seen to follow from the relationship in equation (8). as a check
we can compute

[ h, on +jyi

a
ni]|0ii = 0.

(15)

this is not surprising from the gauge theory perspective since the relations
between traces are independent of the gauge theory action s.

summarizing these calculations, we nd that the hamiltonian h when
treated non-perturbatively at nite n requires the integrality of n. for a
given value of n, we nd an innite set of n-dependent constraints on phys-
ical states {oj(n), j = n + 1, . . .} which are consistently propagated by h.

7

these constraints ensure that the vacuum is unique and that no negative
energy states appear, and are exactly the known relationships among traces
of powers of n  n matrices.

we have taken some care in this analysis to avoid any use of the gauge
theory origins of h. indeed in the gauge theory the integrality of n, the
appearance of constraints, their form, and the fact that the constraints are
background independent, are all completely obvious. from the string hamil-
tonian point of view, we know of no obvious reason why the string eld theory
hamiltonian derived without regard to nite n niceties exhibits all the re-
quired phenomena when treated carefully at nite values of the coupling, but
in fact we have shown that it does!

the hamiltonian h is universal:

it is part of any string theory derived
from a yang-mills theory. consider a given wilson loop specied as the
holonomy of the gauge eld around some curve c. there are wilson loops en-
tirely analogous to the multiple winding states we considered above obtained
by computing the holonomy for multiple circuits around c. the joining and
splitting of these loops is described precisely by h. thus the truncation of
the string spectrum is universal in such yang-mills strings. to be explicit,
the point is that oscillator states of a multiply-wound string are identied
with oscillator states of two (or more) strings at nite coupling. the stronger
the coupling, the fewer the independent states of a single stringthis is a
fascinating dynamical phenomenon from the string point of view. it is di-
cult to see how such identications of the string spectrum would be visible
in rst-quantized string theory, though we cannot exclude this denitively
since we have only a gauge-xed framework[10].

3 remarks and speculations

in what follows, we list some remarks and speculations.

 in this paper we started from a hamiltonian designed to reproduce the
schwinger-dyson equations, without explicitly taking matrix identities
into account. this resulted in a simple hamiltonian[15], eq. 7, as com-
pared to the complicated hamiltonian which arises if one attempts to
take the matrix identities into account explicitly[4]. what we found is
that the simple hamiltonian dynamically generates constraints that

8

exactly implement the matrix identities. this of course results in a
reduction of single string states above winding n  1/gst.

 the analogues of wilson loops for theories with adjoint scalars are ob-
vious and satisfy the same constraints. the naive counting of dimen-
sions suggests that the string theory constructed from n = 4, d = 4
yang-mills theory is associated with a string theory in 11 dimensions.
however, given a string eld theory hamiltonian in a particular gauge
one has to explicitly calculate to deduce the approximate background
geometry on which the string propagates, if such a classical geometry
exists. in stochastic quantization only the innite time correlation func-
tions are uniquely dened[12]. this corresponds in the string theory to
boundary correlation functions. we speculate that in the n = 4, d = 4
yang-mills theory the stochastic time will be identied with the ra-
dial coordinate of the ads5, and that this connection is at the root of
holography[17].
it is by no means clear that a holographic relation-
ship exists in every case of the suggested association[10] of a string
theory with a yang-mills theory even though the boundary correlation
functions will always be reproduced.

 q-deformations have been suggested[18] as explanations for the trunca-
tion of the spectrum of chiral primaries. it would be interesting to see if
they are related to our calculations. in a dierent vein, t hooft has sug-
gested that quantum gravity is a dissipative deterministic system[19].
there may be a connection with the approach described in this paper.

 finally multiply wound strings appear in perturbative calculations of
high energy string scattering[20]. it would be interesting to reconsider
the true high-energy behaviour in yang-mills strings taking into ac-
count a truncation of the number of windings as we have found.
