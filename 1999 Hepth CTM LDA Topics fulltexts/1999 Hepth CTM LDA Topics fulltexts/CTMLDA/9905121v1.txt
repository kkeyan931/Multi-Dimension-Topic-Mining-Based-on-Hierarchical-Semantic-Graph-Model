abstract

we study supersymmetry breaking by hidden-sector gaugino condensation in
n =1 d=4 supergravity models with multiple dilaton-like moduli elds. our
work is motivated by type i string theory, in which the low-energy eective
lagrangian can have dierent dilaton-like elds coupling to dierent sectors of
the theory. we construct the eective lagrangian for gaugino condensation and
use it to compute the visible-sector gaugino masses. we nd that the gaugino
masses can be of order the gravitino mass, in stark contrast to heterotic string
models with a single dilaton eld.

introduction

before the recent string duality revolution, most string phenomenology centered on
perturbative n =1 d=4 heterotic string theories. the discovery of string duality and
d-branes, however, opened a variety of new approaches to string phenomenology based
on type i and type ii string theories. for example, much recent work has focussed on
the intriguing possibility that our four-dimensional world lies at the intersection of a
set of dp-branes (3 p9) embedded in 9 + 1-dimensional spacetime.1

a well-known problem with the usual perturbative heterotic string phenomenology
is that hidden-sector gaugino condensation [4] gives rise to visible-sector gaugino masses
that are much smaller than the scale of supersymmetry breaking [5][6]. this is a
consequence of the fact that a single dilaton couples to all gauge and matter elds.
gaugino condensation induces a small f term for the dilaton eld, and the dilaton
couplings then give small masses to the gauginos.

in type i models, however, the situation can be very dierent. in these models,
the hidden and visible sectors can live on dierent d-branes. each sector has its own
dilaton-like elds [2]. the hidden-sector dilatons receive small f terms from gaugino
condensation. however, these f terms are not responsible for the visible-sector gaugino
masses, and therefore the gaugino masses are not forced to be small.

inspired by this possibility, in this paper we study the question of supersymmetry
breaking by hidden-sector gaugino condensation in n =1 d=4 supergravity models
with multiple dilaton-like elds. we compute the visible-sector gaugino masses and
nd that they can indeed be of order the supersymmetry breaking scale. we see that
type i models oer an appealing solution to the gaugino mass problem associated with
heterotic string theories.

we approach this problem in the spirit of eective eld theory. we take our visible
sector to be composed of multiple pure n =1 super yang-mills theories, each coupled
to gravity, and each to its own dilaton-like eld. we take our hidden sector to be
composed of gaugino condensate elds, one on each set of branes. the condensate
elds are also coupled to gravity, and to their associated dilatons.2 by construction,
this theory describes the low-energy limit of a type i string theory, where each super
yang-mills theory lives on its own set of d-branes. of course, our analysis also applies
to other string/m theory vacua with multiple dilaton-like elds.

2to simplify our presentation, we ignore all charged chiral superelds; this restriction does not

aect the results of our analysis.

various n =1 d=4 type i models have been proposed in the literature [7][19].
particularly simple examples can be constructed from type i models with d9-branes
and d5-branes compactied on t 2t 2t 2, where ri is the radius of the ith two-torus,
i = 1, 2, 3. (d5-branes that wrap on the ith two-torus are denoted as d5i-branes.)
these models have one dilaton eld s, three untwisted moduli elds ti (i = 1, 2, 3)
and additional twisted moduli elds from the closed string sector. other d-brane
congurations can be obtained from these by t-duality.

one such example is a type i model with two sectors, built from d9-branes and d51-
branes. the gauge bosons arise from open strings ending on the d9- and d51-branes.
the low-energy eective lagrangian is as follows3 [1][15],

a second example contains d9-branes as well as d5i-branes compactied on all
three tori (i = 1, 2, 3). it has four sectors, and four dilaton-like elds, s, t1, t2, t3, as
dened in (1.3). these elds couple to the gauge elds on the d9- and d5i-branes and
give rise to the eective lagrangian

the plan of this paper is as follows. in section 2, we dene our n =1 d=4 super-
gravity model with multiple dilaton-like elds. in section 3, we argue that the extra
dilaton-like elds allow gaugino masses to be as large as the gravitino mass. we also
present an explicit example of this scenario.

in appendix a, we exhibit the linearchiral duality for n =1 d=4 supergravity
models with multiple linear supermultiplets. in appendix b we extract the relevant
pieces of the component supergravity lagrangian. finally, in appendix c we check our
results by comparing with the chiral supermultiplet formulation.

2 supergravity with multiple dilaton-like fields

in this section we dene the n =1 d=4 supergravity model that we will study. we
start by considering a system with n dierent types of d-branes. of these, we take
n to be dp a-branes ( a = 1,   , n) with weakly coupled visible-sector elds on their
world volumes. we take the remaining n  n to be dpa-branes (a = 1,   , n  n )
with strongly coupled hidden-sector elds in the condensation phase.
let us rst construct the eective theory of the visible sector. for each value of a,
let w a denote the super yang-mills eld strength on the a-th set of branes, and let
v a be the real supereld which contains the a-th dilaton-like eld [21]. the eld v a
obeys the constraint

 ( d2  8r) v a = w aw a.

(2.1)

this constraint couples the dilatons to the super yang-mills elds.

in kahler superspace [20], the supergravity kinetic terms are given by a lagrangian

l and a kahler function k. for the visible-sector elds, we take them to be

l = z d4 e 


n

k =

where

d v a

= f a  v a

d f a
d v a

.

,

f a( v a) 


(2.2)

(2.3)

in these expressions, the leading terms describe the tree-level couplings of the gauge
and dilaton-like elds; the functions g a( v a) and f a( v a) contain corrections beyond
tree level. the condition (2.3) guarantees that the einstein gravity term is canonically

3

normalized. (for simplicity, we do not include mixings between the dierent v as. such
mixings arise at the loop level, but they do not change our conclusions.5)

in the hidden sector, the eective lagrangian is dierent because the super yang-
mills elds are in a strongly-coupled condensation phase. this leads us to replace the
yang-mills elds by chiral condensate superelds ua [22]. these elds are contained
within the real superelds va [23][24], where

 ( d2  8r)va = ua.

(2.4)

the hidden-sector dilaton-like elds are also contained in the elds va.

the eective lagrangian for this sector contains kinetic and superpotential terms.

the kinetic terms are as above,

l = z d4 e

(2.6)

the leading terms describe the tree-level couplings, while ga(va) and fa(va) contain
corrections beyond tree level.

the superpotential terms are generated by nonperturbative eects associated with

gaugino condensation. in what follows, we take the superpotential to be given by

la = z d4

where ba=2b
a is the one-loop -function coecient of dpa-sector. the form
of this term is dictated by the anomalies of the underlying super yang-mills theory
[4][22][25][26][27].

in rigid supersymmetry, the superpotential is xed by the chiral and conformal
in local supersymmetry, the kahler anomaly also comes into play
anomalies [22].
[28][29]. in particular, it xes the explicit k dependence of the superpotential. under

5type i models typically contain chiral superelds charged under the dp a and dp a gauge groups
( a 6= a). these superelds mix the dierent dilaton-like elds. our study ignores charged chiral
superelds, so it is consistent to ignore mixings between dierent v as.

this is precisely the right transformation to match the kahler anomaly of the underlying
super yang-mills theory [4][25][26][27].

the hidden-sector superpotential couples all sectors through its explicit k dependence;
it gives rise to gaugino masses in the visible sector.

3 gaugino masses

to nd the gaugino masses, we need certain terms from the component-eld lagrangian.
these terms are computed in appendix b.

6note also that these expressions contain contributions from extra moduli elds i, i = 1, , n.

in the context of type i models, the i are twisted or non-dilaton-like untwisted moduli elds.

which couple to the visible and hidden sectors, respectively. moreover, ua = ua|==0

(3.3)

(3.4)

to understand these formulae, let us rst examine the gaugino mass in a theory

with just one dilaton [6][30][31]. in this case the gaugino mass is as follows [6],

m = * 1 + b

all scalar elds are evaluated at the minimum of the potential,

(3.6)

from this we see that any vacuum with zero cosmological constant satises h1 + f 
fi = 3b2h2i + o(b3). since h1 + fi and hi are numbers of order one, equation (3.5)
implies that m is smaller than m g by a factor of b.

let us compare this to a model in which the visible and hidden sectors couple to
dierent dilaton-like elds. the scalar potential of (3.1) receives contributions from
f a
both sectors, proportional to h1 + f a  a
 i and h1 + f a af a
 i. however, to leading
f a
order, only h1+ f a  a
 i contributes to the gaugino masses. as above, minimizing the
f a
a), but it does not constrain h1 + f a  a
potential forces h1 + f a af a
 i.
this suggests that the gaugino masses can indeed be as large as the gravitino mass.

 i to be o(b2

to see this explicitly, let us consider an example with just two types of d-branes
( n =1 and n=2). each has its own dilaton-like eld,  a and a. the scalar potential
follows from (3.1), with no summation over the indices a and a:

to actually compute the gaugino mass, we need to specify the functions f a and f a.
(the functions ga and g a are determined via (2.11)). we choose them to stabilize the
runaway vacuum typically associated with dilaton-like elds.7 the general procedure
is described in [30][34]. for now, we consider the following simple choice,8

fa = p  eq/a,

f a = p  e q/ a,

p,q, p, q > 0.

4 conclusion

the presence of multiple dilaton-like moduli elds is a very important feature of n =1
d=4 type i string models. the extra dilaton-like elds can change the resulting phe-
nomenology in many ways. in this paper we examined their eect on supersymmetry
breaking by hidden-sector gaugino condensation.

we studied a scenario in which dierent dilaton-like elds couple to the hidden and
visible sectors. we assumed that supersymmetry is broken by gaugino condensation in
the hidden sector. we found that the visible-sector gaugino masses can be as large as
gravitino mass because of the extra dilaton-like elds. our results stand in contrast
to the usual heterotic string phenomenology, where the gaugino masses are typically
much smaller.

in this appendix we prove that a supergravity model with n linear supermultiplets is
dual to another supergravity model with n chiral supermultiplets.9 we will show that
both models can be obtained from the following lagrangian,

form; it obeys

(a.4)

for a = 1,   , n.

let us rst integrate out the sas in l. their equations of motion are as follows,
(a.5)

 ( d2  8r)va = wawa.

this equation can be used to eliminate the second term in (a.1), reducing l to a
model with n linear supermultiplets. note that the einstein gravity term is canonically
normalized because of (a.3).

b component-field lagrangian

in this appendix, we compute the necessary elements of the component-eld lagrangian
corresponding to the supereld lagrangian (2.10)(2.11). we use the chiral density

(b.1)

in these expressions, the a are dilaton-like scalar elds, and the ba

of freedom in the same supermultiplets. the elds ua are the gaugino condensate elds
of the hidden sector.

to extract the potential (3.1), we must eliminate the auxiliary elds. we will not do
that here, except to note that the equations of motion for the auxiliary elds (fa + fa)
are

1 + fa + baa ln(cid:16)ek uaua(cid:17) + 2baa = 0.

this xes the modulus of the condensate eld ua to be

ua u a = exp"(cid:18)k  2(cid:19)    1 + fa

baa !# .

(b.6)

(b.7)

the modulus has the correct dependence on the gauge group and gauge coupling, as
expected from the usual renormalization group arguments [6][31].

c gaugino masses in the chiral supermultiplet for-

mulation

in this appendix we compute the gaugino masses using the chiral supermultiplet for-
mulation. by linearchiral duality, the result must be identical to the one obtained in
section 3.

13

following appendix a, it is straightforward to write down the chiral supermultiplet
formulation of the model dened by (2.10)(2.11). the real superelds v a and va
dualize to chiral superelds12 s a and sa. the linearchiral duality relations include
(a.5) and

s a + s a =

1 + f a( v a)

v a

.

this gives rise to the following identities:

s a + s a =

1 + f a

 a

,

h fs a i =  h m i

(c.1)

(c.2)

the rst is the ==0 component of (c.1). the second is obtained by acting on both
sides of (c.1) with the operator d2, and then taking the vacuum expectation value of
the lowest component.

the expression for the gaugino masses is standard,

m a
 = 

h fs a i
h s a + s a i

,

(c.3)

4d2 s a|==0. using (c.2) and hmi = 3m g, we nd
where s a = s a|==0 and f s a
a nal result for the gaugino masses that is identical to (3.3), obtained from the linear
supermultiplet formalism.

12it can be shown that the linearchiral duality established in appendix a also applies to the
eective theory description of veneziano and yankielowicz [22]. in particular, the linearchiral duality
relations remain the same.
