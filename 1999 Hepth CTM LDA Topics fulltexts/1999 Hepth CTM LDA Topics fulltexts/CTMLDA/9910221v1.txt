abstract

we introduce a soliton model for charged fermions, a four-dimensional
generalisation of the sine-gordon model. starting from a unimodular
quaternionic eld which denes a local coordinate system at each point
in space and time we can determine a local curvature. in addition to a
curvature term we introduce a potential term in the energy density which
stabilizes charged topological excitations with a coulomb eld. we dicuss
some properties of these particles and implications of the model. the soli-
tons of this model follow paulis exclusion principle but not paulis anti-
symmetrisation principle, they feel coulomb and lorentz forces and can
annihilate with anti-solitons. they behave in many aspects like charged
leptons. in addition to the solitons we nd freely propagating electromag-
netic waves. besides fundamental constants there is only one parameter
in the theory, thats a fundamental length r0.

1 introduction

the standard model of quantum eld-theory describes electromagnetic, weak
and strong interactions and includes three generations of fermions. up to now
all possible predictions of the standard model are in agreement with experiment.
nevertheless, in connection with the standard model there are still many inter-
esting questions which demand for further explanations. the deepest of them
may be the origin of mass, the experimental evidence for three generations of
fermions and of three types of interactions. further there are a lot of interest-
ing properties which by the standard model are accounted for in a very abstract
way. the most prominent of these problems is the running of the couplings.
the naivly formulated action turns out to predict only useless innite numbers.
a redenition of the theory is necessary. in the renormalisation procedure it
turns out that the theory can only be formulated in a consistent way if the
coupling constant varies with the transfered momentum, a property which
is reproduced very well in high energy experiments. in the standard model it
is necessary to treat the fermions with special anticommuting numbers, with
grassman variables, in order to account for the pauli principle. the vacuum

1

of quantum eld theory turns out to be a most complicated state. the qcd
vacuum, the vacuum of quantum chromo dynamics, can only account for the
connement of colour charges, if it has the properties of a magnetic medium. in
this sense quantum eld theory has reintroduced the concept of ether in a form
which is compatible with relativity.

there are further many well established and accepted eects which could ask
for some deeper understanding. to this group belong the well known relativistic
properties of particles, like the velocity dependence of mass, lorentz contraction
and time dilatation which are usually derived from the basic lorentz transfor-
mation properties and in this way not accessible to an intuitive understanding.
there are questions which occupy the mind of physicists since decades like
the einstein-rosen-podolsky paradox and the absence of magnetic monopoles.
from an extreme point of view one could compare the high level of abstaction
of theoretical physics with the epicycles in the ptolemaeic world system and hope
for a more intuitive explanation of physical phenomena.

there are some hints for the origin of the above mentioned problems. gauge
theories, the basic theories for the standard model, treat fundamental fermions
as point-like particles. the fermionic determinant in the path integrale formu-
lation of quantum eld theory turns out to be a summation over all possible
pathes of these point-like fermions. the fermions interact with the gauge eld
only via the registration of a generalised phase of the gauge elds along these
pathes. a long standing puzzle in this connection is the so called fermion dou-
bling problem. it was proven by nielsen and nyonima [1] that it is not possible
to formulate fermionic elds in a discretised world with periodic boundary con-
ditions in a unique manner.

there is a simple 1+1-dimensional model [2], the sine-gordon model which
has a characteristic type of 2-kink solutions which are topological excitations.
they have many simple properties, which request a rather complicated treat-
ment within the standard model of quantum eld theory. a chain of elastically
connected pendula on a horizontal mechanical transmission line is a simple me-
chanical model following the sine-gordon equation. the properties of a moving
kink give a very intuitive understanding of relativistic properties. a kink-soliton
can be accelerated by an increase of torsion and therefore of energy stored in the
kink. lorentz contraction and the velocity dependence of the energy of the
kink follow exactly the well-known formulae of special relativity. the velocity
of the kink is limited to the speed of the propagation of small amplitude waves,
i.e. the mechanical analog of the speed of light. kinks and anti-kinks behave
like positive and negative charges. equal kinks repel and opposite kinks attract
each other. kink-antiking pairs can annihilate to two waves propagating in op-
posite directions. the repulsion of two kinks is increasing with their relative
velocity. the increase of the torsion of kinks in a collision is a simple analog of
the running of the coupling with the momentum transfer. two kinks can never
be at the same place  a behaviour requested by the pauli exclusion princi-
ple. these analogies between sine-gordon model and basic physical properties
dont include the propagation of waves.
in the sine-gordon model there are
no free waves propagating with the speed of light. the potential energy allows

2

only for photons with a mass. low amplitude waves follow a 1+1-dimensional
klein-gordon equation.

the analogies of the sine-gordon model inspired skyrme in his hope for an
unied field theory of mesons and baryons [3]. it seems that the investigations
in this eld were restricted to the description of hadrons. we will present in
this article an application of similiar ideas to the description of electric charges,
especially electrons, and electro-magnetic elds. the 3+1-dimensional model
presented in this article generalizes most of the appealing properties of the sine-
gordon model and includes further free propagating waves.

2 formulation of the model

the fundamental idea of gauge theories is the existence of a local coordinate
system for the internal degrees of freedom like weak-isospin or colour and the
independence of all observations from the orientation of this system. one of
the basic ideas of our model is that gauge theories need only be reproduced at
large distances from charges. at short distances we want to stay as close as
possible to sine-gordon type models where the phase is a well-dened function
of the coordinate, i.e. we assume a well-dened local coordinate system at every
space-time point. according to the standard model of strong and electro-weak
interactions the most obvious assignment seems to be an su (2)-eld for leptons
and an su (3)-eld for hadrons which denes this local coordinate system. in
the following we will concentrate on su (2)-elds. it is essential for our model
that these elds can form topological solitons with the properties of a monopole.

2.1 local coordinate systems and geometry

it may be historically interesting that su (2)-elds are strongly related to hamil-
tons quaternions [4]. quaternions are generalisations of complex numbers which
contain a real part and three imaginary parts with the corresponding units i,
j and k, with the non-commutative multiplication law i2 = j2 = k2 = ijk = 1.
it is well known that the properties of these units are just the properties of
paulis spin matrices i = i1, j = i2, k = i3. an su (2)-eld assigns to
every point x = (~x, t) in space-time a unimodular quaternionic number q(x) by

q = q0 + ikqk = (cid:18) q0 + iq3

q2 + iq1

q2 + iq1

q0 + iq3 (cid:19) with |q2| := q2

0 + ~q2 = 1.

(1)

the condition q2
0 + ~q2 = 1 restricts the parameter-space of su (2)-matrices to
the unit-sphere s3 of r4. the unimodularity of su (2)-matrices shows up in
their exponential representation as a generalised phase-factor

q = expi~n~ with q0 = cos , qk = nk sin , ~n2 = 1.

(2)

the generalised phase ~n~ = nkk is a generalised imaginary part of a
quaternionic number, an element of the su(2)-algebra (in the dening represen-

3

tation).1

we can dene the scalar product of two quaternions p and q via the scalar

product of the corresponding vectors (q0, ~q) and (p0, ~p) in r4

p  q = q  p := q0p0 + ~q~p =

1
2

tr(qp ) =

1
2

tr(qp ).

(3)

along a path ~x(s) in space-time, parametrized by a parameter s, the elds
q(s) denes, as we will discuss below, a rotation of the local coordinate system
and may induces a curvature which we can relate to the electric eld strength.
the situation is analog to that on the curved surface of earth, which has the
topology of s2, of the usual sphere. at the north-pole we can dene a local two-
dimensional coordinate system, e.g. by the 0 and 90 meridians and identify
them with the real unit 1 and the imaginary unit i. therefore, any vector in
the tangential plane of the north-pole can be represented by a complex number
w. a parallel transport of the coordinate system from the north-pole along
meridians, characterised by the azimutal angle , inherits the basic system to
arbitrary positions (, ) on earth. they are rotated by  with respect to the
direction of the meridians. a parallel transport of a two-dimensional tangential
vector w from (, ) along an arbitrary big circle results in a change of its phase
by some . the vector-eld ~ which describes the continous rotation of the
local coordinate system depends on the direction d~s of movement, it is the eld
of connection coecients or kristoel symbols

w d~s w = (1  id) w = (1  isds) w.

(4)

for the above mentioned case of an su (2)-eld the parameter space is s3.
we can dene three orthogonal unit vectors at the north-pole with q = 1,
e.g. the three imaginary quaternionic units or 1, 2 and 3. the set of vectors
(su(2)-algebra elements) ~v~ = vkk builds the tangential space at the north-
pole. the product v = ~v~q is an element of the tangential space at q, since
its scalar product with q according to eq.(3) vanishes

v  q = tr(v q) =

1
2

tr(~v~qq) =

1
2

vktrk = 0.

(5)

therefore, by its action on k, q inherits a local coordinate system kq to each
position on s3 and also to any point in coordinate-space r3.

1we use the summation convention that any latin index that is repeated in a product is
automatically summed on from 1 to 3. the arrows on variables in the internal space indicate
the set of 3 elements ~q = (q1, q2, q3) or ~ = (1, 2, 3) and ~q~ = qkk.

the derivative of q(s) along some path parametrised by s

sq = lim
s0

q(s + s)  q(s)

s

(8)

is a vector of this tangential space at q(s). therefore it can be written as a
linear combination of the basis vectors q
k

with q(s) = cos (s) + i~~n(s) sin (s) and

sq = i~s~q.

(sq) q = i~n ~n + sin  cos  ~n  sin2  ~n  ~no

we get

~s = ~n + sin  cos  ~n  sin2  ~n  ~n,

where the dot represents the derivative with respect to s.

(9)

(10)

(11)

now we want to get contact with physics and identify the properly nor-
malised ux through an arbitrary rectangle dsdt in space with the area ~s 
~tdsdt of the corresponding parallelogramm in the tangential space of the soli-
ton eld q. to emphasize the strong relation between this model, dierential
geometry and gauge theories we are now going to derive another expression
for this ux, which is well known from non-abelian gauge theories. this is in
accordance with the theorema egregium of carl friedrich gau.

the derivatives of the basis vectors q

k at q along some path parametrised by
s have components in the tangential plane at q, i.e. along q
k and a component
in radial direction q. these components can be found multiplying eq. (9) from
the left with k and using

(~~a) (cid:16)~~b(cid:17) = ~a~b + i~~a  ~b.

we get

sq

l + iksq,

k = jkljsq

l + iksq = iklsq

or in matrix notation

s~q = is~q + i~sq,

(12)

(13)

(14)

where the connection s describes the (passive) rotation of the coordinate sys-
tem along the curve parametrised by s

(s)kl = kls = (tj)kl js

with

(tj)kl = ijkl.

(15)

tj are the generators in the (adjoint) t = 1representation of su (2) with

[tj, tk] = ijkltl,

t 
j = tj,

tr (tjtk) = 2jk.

(16)

the relation for the area ~s  ~tdsdt, we look for, we get from the commu-

tatitivity of derivatives

i
= (tkms + iklslmt + iksmt) q
= (skmt + ikltlms + iktms) q

m + (tks + iklslt) q =
m + (skt + ikltls) q.

(17)

a comparison of the coecients in the directions q

m leads to

skmt + tkms + iklslmt  ikltlms =
= i (ksmt  ktms) = ilkmlijisjt = (tl)km (~s  ~t)l .

(18)

this is the well-known expression for the ux density in non-abelian gauge-
theories. it reads in matrix notation

st + ts + i [s, t] = ~t (~s  ~t) .

(19)

in our model we have the further relations for the ux

~t (~s  ~t) = i [s, t] =

1
2

(ts  st) ,

(20)

which follow from eq. (15) and eq. (16). these equalities agree with the equa-
tion one can get from the q-components of eq. (17).

2.2 the electric monopole

for the description of electric charges we want to take advantage of the topology
of s3 using the ansatz

q = cos  + i nkk sin , with  = (r),

~n =

~r
r

(21)

for the su(2)-eld q of eq.(2), which we would like to call the soliton-eld.

the vector-eld  we determine in spherical coordinates by a parallel trans-

port along dr, d or d according to eq.(11)

r = (r) ~er,
 = sin  [cos  ~e  sin  ~e] ,
 = sin  sin  [sin  ~e + cos  ~e] ,

(22)

where ~er, ~e, ~e are the corresponding unit vectors and the prime indicates
derivatives with respect to r.

up to a measure system dependent constant we dene the electric eld
strength as the ux divided by the corresponding area. we get for this ra-
tio r for innitesimal quadrilaterals of length dr, rd and r sin d along the

6

coordinate axes r,  and 

r =

~t (~  ~) dd

(23)

with ~e = cos  ~e  sin  ~e and ~e = sin  ~e + cos  ~e.

obviously, these expressions correspond to the eld strength tensors in dual
non-abelian gauge theories. for a regular behaviour of eld strength a soliton
eld of the form (21) has to start at the origin from one of the center elements of
su (2) and (0) has to be an integer multiple of . for a nite energy solution,
(r) has to approach zero fast enough at inninity. therefore, the behaviour
at large distances is dominated by the curvature component r. its functional
form looks very promising since for

() = (0) +

nw

(24)

and odd nw we get a 1/r2 behaviour of the eld strength and for even nw the
eld strength is vanishing much faster at innity

(28)

(29)

it is very well known from skyrme models, see e.g. [3], that this expression
is not able to stabilize the topological eld conguration. this can be concluded
from a simple scaling argument. lets start from an arbitrary eld conguration
with energy e and make a scale transformation by a factor  > 1. it follows
that the energy decreases by a factor 1/ and the minimisation of the integral
in (29) leads to an unbounded increase of the size of the object.

2.3 stabilisation of the monopole solution

in order to stabilize the solution (25) we have to add a term which scales with
a positive power of . if we used a mass term for the vector elds we would
arrive at the skyrme model which has only topological stable solutions of type
(26).

the potential term which we look for should vanish for  = (2n + 1)/2
and should be an even function of q0 = cos . we will discuss in the following
potential energies of the form

hp = f hcz 

0

dr

r2
r4
0

cos2m ,

m = 1, 2, 3,    .

(30)

they scale with 3 and keep the topological soltiton together like the potential
energy term in our one-dimensional analogon, the sine-gordon model.

with this assumption the total energy functional reads in scaled coordinates

 = r

h = he + hp =

f hc

d(cid:20) sin4 

22 + ( cos )2 + 2 cos2m (cid:21) .

(31)

wich besides the power m contains a single free parameter, a fundamental length
scale r0. another possibility would be to use cot2  in the potential energy
density.

variation with respect to cos () in eq. (31) leads to a non-linear second

order dierential equation

(32)

2.4 discussion of monopole solutions

for m = 3 we can give the lowest energy solution explicitely

(r) = atan() with  =

.

it follows

sin (r) =



p1 + 2

cos (r) =

(35)

for the radial eld, the tangential eld and the potential term, respectively.
their integrals behave like 2:1:1 and sum up to the total energy

h1 =

f hc

r0


4

with f hc = 1.44 mev fm.

(36)

if we compare this expression with the energy of the electron of 0.511 mev, we
get r0 = 2.21 fm. a value which seems rather large.

the excited states can be determined numerically. in fig. 1 we show the
behaviour of (r) for nw = 1, 3 and 5 according to eqs. (24) and (32) and
the three contributions to the radial energy densities for these three states for
a potential energy term with power m = 3.

for these solutions we get the following energy ratios

h1 : h3 : h5 = 1 : 5.5 : 11.4 for m = 3.

(37)

increasing the power m of the potential term (30) one gets higher ratios. the
results for some powers are shown in fig. 2. they are determined by numerical
minimisation of the action functional (31). the indicated errors are the energy
dierences which result from a doubling of the integration intervals. increasing
the power m the mass ratios increase with an increasing power of nw and come
closer to the experimental mass ratios 1 : 207 : 4010 of electron, muon and
tauon. it seems that one can reach for some high value of m  350 the me : m
ratio, but it seems that at this power the experimental me : m ratio stays still
too small.

there is a certain freedom in the choice of the potential energy term (30).
but it is not yet clear if other functional dependences allow for stable solutions
with good agreement with the experimental mass ratios.

the stable soliton solutions show an interesting relation between the con-
tributions of the potential and the electric energy to the total energy. this
relation can even be used in numerical calculations to test the accuracy of the
approximation. in the next section we treat the relativistic behaviour of the
solitons. it will turn out that this relation is a necessary condition for the rel-
ativistic behaviour of the solitons of our theory. one can easily show that this
type of virial theorem is guaranteed by the functional form of the energy ex-
pression, it is well-known in skyrme-models under the name of hobart-derrick
necessity condition [3]. let us follow this important argument and return to
the scale transformations which we mentioned in connection with the stability

2.5 particle properties of solitons

one of the nice features of the sine-gordon model is the relativistic behaviour
of its solitons. to gain insight into the corpuscular nature of the solitions of this
model we introduce the speed of light c and investigate a conguration moving
with a constant velocity  = v/c in z-direction

qv(x) = cos (|~r  ~vt|) + i ~

~r  ~vt
|~r  ~vt|

sin (|~r  ~vt|),

(39)

in four-dimensional space-time x = (ct, ~x). for the vector-eld  of connection-
coecients we dene an additional time component ( = 0)

 = ~t ~ = ~t

1
2i

tr(cid:8)~ (q) q(cid:9) .

(40)

this allows to introduce a curvature in space-time directions and the corre-
sponding physical quantity, the magnetic induction ~b

cbk :=

e0

40

(0k  k0  i [0, k]) .

(41)

in addition to the static contribution to the energy density of the moving soliton
we therefore expect dynamic, magnetic contributions

h := t + v, v := he + hp,

t := hm,

he :=

(42)

.

in all dynamical systems with a competition between static and dynamic
degrees of freedom, allowing for an oscillatory behaviour, one has to search for
solutions where variations of the static part are compensated by variations of
the dynamic part and therefore the sum of both contributions is a constant of
motion and the dierence an extremum. this requirement is the basis for the
lagrangian formalism, where one looks for an extremum of the action

s :=

1

c z d4xl, l := t  v.

(43)

11

due to the special t-dependence in eq. (39) we get

0 = z, 0 = z.

and the relations

cbx = ey,

cby = ex,

cbz = 0.

(44)

(45)

follow immediately. these equations are well known from special relativity for
the relation between electric and magnetic elds in a reference frame moving
with velocity v in negative z-direction with respect to a static charge. here,
they follow from the assumption that the soliton doesnt change its shape with
time.

moving sine-gordon solitons are compressed relative to the static congu-
rations as requested by their relativistic behaviour. to nd an analogous be-
haviour of our solitons we transform the coordinates ~x of the laboratory system

to uncontracted comoving coordinates


~x


z = (z  vt),


x,


y = x, y,

(46)

with a scale factor  which we can x by the above mentioned variational prin-
ciple. according to (39) and (40) this transformation implies

the rst two of these conditions are fullled due to the symmetry of the so-
lution of the minimisation problem in the comoving frame. the last one is a

12

consequence of the derrick-hobart necessity condition, as discussed at the end
of sect. 2.4.

this discussion shows that it is possible to understand the relativistic be-
haviour of particles, e.g. lorentz contraction and velocity dependence of mass,
on a microsopic basis through the dynamics of the soliton eld. lorentz con-
traction turns out to be a consequence of the necessity to accelerate the soliton
eld. additional electric curvature energy of q is needed for this acceleration
process which can be transformed locally in magnetic (dynamic) energy. both
parts contribute to the relativistic energy of the moving particle

2.6 four-dimensional formulation

it is now easy to give the four-dimensional formulation of this model. we
indroduce the (dual) eld strength tensor f according to eqs.(27) and (41)

f := 

e0

r .

with eqs. (23), (19) and (20) we can write f in various forms

(54)

the rst part of this lagrangian is nothing else than the lagrangian of dual
su (2) gauge theory. formally, we have added to the lagrangian a potential
term which is connected with the local coordinate system at every point in
space-time.

with ~ according to eq. (11)

~ =  ~n + sin  cos  ~n  sin2  ~n  ~n,

(55)

we can write the square of the curvature in the lagrangian (54) as a function

(56)

by standard methods one can derive equations of motion and invariants from

eqs. (54) and (56).

2.7 u(1)-gauge theory

with the lagrangian (54) we succeeded to fomulate a theory for topological
solitons with a coulomb eld. let us now investigate the relation of the su (2)-
eld to the u (1)-eld of charges in maxwells theory. according to the electro-
weak model one could think of a u (1)  su (2)-structure of these degrees of
freedom. but due to the cartesian product there are no special solitons which
could be introduces by an additional u (1)-eld and there is no simple possibility
to transfer eld strength from su (2) to u (1)-degrees of freedom. it turns out
that this relation can be formulated in a much simpler way. at large distances
from the center of a charged soliton the potential term hp restricts the eld
degrees of freedom to an s2-sphere, to the sphere with

q0 = 0  q2

1 + q2

2 + q2

3 = 1

for

r  .

(57)

in this region the potential term can be neglected and the remaining degrees of
freedom are the ~n-elds which appear in the expression (56) for the square
of the curvature. they live in the tangential spaces of the sphere s2. on this
sphere we can choose the local coordinate systems arbitrarily. therefore, we
arrive at a dual-u (1)-gauge theory. as we suggested in sect. 2 on the north-
pole of this sphere we can identify the unit vectors in  = 0 and 90-directions
with the real unit 1 and the imaginary unit i. a parallel transport of this
coordinate system along the meridians  = const. inherits a local coordinate
system to any position (, ) on this internal s2. the connection coecients
can easily be derived. we have obviously

 = 0.

(58)

a parallel transport of a vector along a parallel of latitude by the angle d leads
to a (passive) rotation of the coordinate system by d. this value we have to
decrease by the angle d cos  for the rotation of the osculating great circle and
get for the connection

d = (1  cos )d.

(59)

if we take into account the spherical symmetry ( = ,  = ) of the soliton
and multiply with the charge factor  e0
40

we get the dual vector potential

c = 0, c = 

e0

40

 =

e0

40

(1  cos ).

(60)

14

the dual vector-potential forms circles around the z-axis and is singular for
 = . this potential is characteristic of a dual dirac monopole, of an electric
monopole of charge e0, whith a singularity of the u (1)-potential along the
negative z-axis. its electric eld strength is given by

~e = ~  ~c = 

e0

40

~er
r2

(61)

a formulation of electrodynamics in terms of dual potentials was given in ref.[5].
in the following we will see that such a vector-potential we can also get by
a gauge-transformation of the connection eld (22) which in the limit of large
radial distances reads

r = 0,  =  ~t ~e,  = sin  ~t~e,

for

r  .

(62)

we have seen in eqs. (5) and (7) that the vectors q

k = kq form an or-
thonormal basis in the tangential space at q. a gauge transformation is nothing
else than a rotation of this basis in the tangential space with some su (2)-matrix

the rotation of the basis vectors denes a matrix in the space of tangent vectors

(65)

under these rotations, the connection eld transforms,   . in analogy

to eq. (14) we write

s~q = i

s~q + i~sq.

for the tangential components in eqs. (14) and (66) follows

s~q = gsg~q  i (sg) ~q


and with (sg) g = gsg we get


s = g (s + is) g.

15

(66)

(67)

(68)

if we specify g = ei


2 or equivalently

g = eit = 1 + i sin  t + (cos  1) t 2
,

we get from (62) and (68) after some calculation


r = 0, 

 = 0, 

 = (cos   1) t3.

(69)

(70)

this result agrees with eq. (59). therefore, our soliton at large distances
behaves like a dual dirac monopole. the dirac string of the u (1)-formulation
appears only as an artifact of the neglection of the internal su (2)-structure of
the monopole.

2.8 types of soliton charges

the u (1) structure of solitons at large distances has interesting consequences.
solitons behave like electric charges. positive and negative charges add like
integer numbers. solitons feel coulomb- and lorentz-forces.

at large distances from an ensemble of solitons and antisolitons we have to

full the condition

q0 = 1



| ~q |= 1.

(71)

this denes a mapping of the internal sint
at innity in co-
ordinate space. it is well-known from topology that such non-singular mappings
can be classied into homotopy classes. these homotopy classes form a group
which in our case is isomorphic to the group of integers and can be written in
the compact form [6]

to the sphere sphy

2

2

2(s2) = z.

(72)

this means, that due to their topological origin all electric charges are integer
multiples of the unit charge e0.

now we are able to classify elementary charges and few particle states. mini-
mal congurations are depending on (0), the winding number nw, as dened in
eq. (24), and on the handiness of the internal coordinate system. left-handed
dreibeine ~n =  ~r
r and negative winding numbers are equivalent. the systemat-
ics seems simpler if we use only positive dreibeine ~n = ~r
r and allow for negative
winding numbers.

the situations is evident for (0) = 0 modulo 2. the charge ze0 depends

on the winding number. with the prefactor  e0
40

in eq. (52) we get

z =  sin

nw

2

,

nw = 2k + 1,

k  z,

(0) = 0 (mod 2).

(73)

as we discussed already in sect. 2.2 there seems to be a strong similiarity
between the properties of solitons and charged leptons. we propose the following

we get further states for (0) = , modulo 2. their relation between

z = sin

nw = 2k + 1,

k  z,

(0) =  (mod 2).

(74)

this means that nw = 1, (0) =  is a further electron state and nw =
+1, (0) =  a further positron state . a schematic diagram of the prole
function (r) is shown in fig. 3. a shift by  in the prole function, (r) 
(r) + , corresponds to a multiplication of the soliton eld q(~r) = cos  +
i~n~ sin  by the nontrivial center element 1 of su (2), q(~r)  (1)q(~r).

it is interesting to see that charge coniugated pairs dier in the sign of k

(parity) and of 0 (time reection). we conclude that the relation

c = p t

(75)

is fullled in agreement with the cpt-theorem. our solitons show how the
cpt-theorem can be realised in a microscopic manner.

17

before we start to discuss the relation of the two types of electron (positron)
states with the possible spin alignments we will investigate soliton states with
even winding numbers (26).

due to the potential energy term (30) we cant construct soliton states of
nite energy with an even winding number (26) and a prole function (~r)
depending only on the radius r. can we construct soliton states with a prole
function which is not spherically symmetric? lets concentrate for symplicity
at a soliton conguration which covers s3 exacly once. for such a conguration
(~r) would have to approach in all radial directions the same su (2) group
element, an element with zero potential energy, e.g. q() = i3. somewhere
in space we have to have the two center elements 1 and 1 of su (2), i.e. centers
of a positive and negative charge. therefore, we end up with positronium-like
states and conclude that soliton states which cover the complete sphere s3 can
be interpreted as eld congurations of pairs of opposite charges.

2.9 many-particle states

there are some interesting puzzles in the conventional treatment of many-
fermion systems.
in quantum mechanics we expand states of many fermions
in a basis of product wave-functions, of slater determinants. the antisymmetry
of many particle wave-function guarantees that two equal particles dont occupy
the same place. when the interacting particles leave the interaction region they
become independent and nally only single particle states are measured in a
detector. due to antisymmetry of the many-particle wave-function quantum
mechanics predicts in general an entangelment of states and cant predict which
components are really measured. the reduction of the wave-function in the
measurement process is still an open question. a further puzzle concerns the
non-locality of the anti-symmetric wave-function and is presently again in hot
discussion under the name of the einstein-podolsky-rosen paradox.

in this article we treat fermions as topological excitations of a bosonic eld.
because of their topological structure the pauli principle in its rst version,
that fermions cant occupy the same quantum state, is guaranteed automati-
cally. the simplest and very instructive example is a pair of solitons in the
sine-gordon-model. if two solitons approach each other, they are repelled. a
two-soliton function is a function of one coordinate only describing a doubly
charged state. it is not constructed as a product wave function of two essen-
tially point-like objects. therefore, there is no need for an antisymmetry of a
fermionic many-particle state in our topological model, there is no reduction of
the wave-function after a spatial separation of scattering particles and no epr-
paradox. such eects are connected with the description of a many-fermion
state by a superposition of antisymmetric product wave-functions of point-like
structureless objects.

we will now discuss the qualitative structure of some special two-particle
states in our soliton model.
in this way we will also get some insight how
the spin properties of fundamental particles are implemented. the simplest
two-particle states could be particle-antiparticle, positronium-like, states.

figure 4: schematic prole of the behaviour of the internal variable  along the
z-axis, q = cos  + i 3 sin  is assumed. the upper diagram corresponds to
a spin-singlet state and the lower to a spin-triplet state of a positronium like
state.

the sine-gordon-model such states are not stationary. solitons and antisoli-
tons attract each other and annihilate. in a mathematical construction we can
stabilize soliton-antisoliton solutions by appropriate mathematical constraints.
we constrain our solutions by xing the positions of the centers of soliton and
antisoliton to

~r+ = (0, 0, +

r
2

),

~r = (0, 0, 

r
2

).

(76)

and assume for simplicity the distance r between the two centers to be much
larger than r0.

positronium is uncharged and the u (1) gauge eld gets trivial at innity,
i.e.
it approaches a constant. therefore, without loss of generality we can x
the soliton eld at innity to q() = i3. with these conditions we have
essentially two choices for the shape of (~r) along the z-axis. the state which
corresponds to fig. 4a behaves like an electron state around ~r = ~r+. there it
is described by a positive winding number nw = 1 according to the ansatz (21)

19

with q( ~r+) = 1, see also fig. 3,

q = cos  + i nkk sin , with  = (| ~r  ~r+ |),

~n =

~r  ~r+

r

(77)

around ~r = ~r it describes a positron state with negative winding number
nw = 1 according to the same ansatz.

the state corresponding to fig. 4b, close to ~r+, behaves identically. close
to ~r it is described by positron state with positive winding number nw = 1
and q( ~r) = 1, see also fig. 3,

q =  cos   i nkk sin , with  = (| ~r  ~r |),

~n =

~r  ~r

r

.

(78)

in the two cases the coverings of s3, the parameter space of su (2), are com-
pletely dierent.
in the rst case the positive hemisphere of s3, around the
trivial center element of su (2), is covered twice, but not exactly. as indicated
in fig. 4a the angle  does not reach zero, especially if the pair of charges
approaches each other. since both coverings of the upper hemisphere are not
complete the curvature term in the action should be reduced compared to the
case depicted in fig. 4b, where the positive and negative hemisphere of s3 are
covered completely. these two cases should therefore correspond to the spin
singlet and the spin triplet state, respectively. the parity of both states corre-
sponds to the expectations. the spin singlet state has dierent winding numbers
for electron and positron and is therefore of negative parity, the spin triplet state
has the same winding numbers and positive parity.

concerning the positronium states the above mentioned winding numbers of
our solitons seem to correspond to the spin alignments of electron and positron.
but in this connection we encounter an essential dierence to the present under-
standing of electrons. electrons with positive magnetic quantum numbers can
be rotated (ipped) to states with negativ magnetic quantum numbers. the
solitons of our model have an internal winding number which can only be re-
moved in an interaction with solitons of opposite winding. in this connection
it may be interesting that according to the knowledge of the author there is no
successful stern-gerlach experiment with electrons. the reason for the failure
of such experiments is usually attributed to the small mass of electrons. as
discussed above in this soliton model one cant transform a soliton of positive
winding number by a rotation to a soliton with negative winding number.

according to the laws of special relativity included in the lagrangian via its
lorentz invariance moving solitons should experience lorentz forces in addition
to coulomb forces.

3 conclusions

our picture of the submicroscopic world has moved far away from intuition.
there may be some hope that we can nd a description which leads us to a
deeper understanding of fundamental particles and their properties.

20

in this model we generalise the sine-gordon model to four dimensions. we
treat fermions as topological excitations of a bosonic eld, a eld of unimod-
ular quaternions, of an su (2)-eld. the lagrangian contains terms he and
hm which are essentially known from quantum electro dynamics and quan-
tum chromo dynamics. in these theories the basic variables are gauge elds
which dene the parallel transport from one local coordinate system to another
nearby, but due to gauge invariance the local coordinate system must not ap-
pear explicitely in the observables. in this topological model we take the concept
of local coordinate systems seriously, the basic variables are topological elds
dening a local coordinate system at each point in space. further, we add a po-
tential term to the lagrangian depending on the choice of this local coordinate
system.

this model has several interesting features which solve long standing puzzles

in particle physics.

 it explains by topology why only electric particles appear in nature and

not their magnetic counterparts.

 it treats fermions as extended objects. therefore, many deep diculties of
quantum eld theories do not appear in this theory. there is no need for
renormalisation leading to a momentum dependence of coupling constants.
such a dependence on the transfered momentum appears quite naturally
for topological fermions as an analogon to hookes law for elastic bodies
at a microscopic level.

 the origin of mass is explained by the eld energy of these extended

particles.

 relativistic properties of fundamental particles, like velocity dependence
of mass and lorentz contraction, can be understood at a microscopic level
analogous to the sine-gordon model.

 there is no need to introduce special anticommuting elds, grassmann
elds, to describe the dynamics of fermions. all eld components are real
valued in this model. the essential point in the description with quater-
nionic elds seems to be that unimodular quaternions allow for a smooth
transfer of energy from one degree of freedom to another. such a possi-
bility for an energy transfer we nd in many basic phenomena in physics,
especially in all oscillatory motions. in oscillating pendula the energy os-
cillates between kinetic and potential energy, in two coupled pendula the
energy is transfered periodically between the two pendula, in electromag-
netic waves the eld energy oscillates between electric and magnetic eld
components, in the quantum mechanical description of a free particle the
energy oscillates between the real and the imaginary part of the wave func-
tion, etc. in our model two of the eld components seem to be undamped,
those are essentially the two polarisations of the electro-magnetic, of the
u (1)-eld. all other components are massive and therefore damped. they

21

cannot propagate freely in space. this last property seems to be impor-
tant for an extension of the model to other fundamental forces, like the
colour and the weak force.

 our model of topological fermions suggests a classical resolution to the
epr paradox for fermions. the wave-functions of many fermions are
not antisymmetrised product wave functions of point-like particles but
rather intrinsically of many body type. for large distances our topolgical
fermions approach asymptotically unique single-particle states. our model
possibly sheds also some light on the problems which appear in quantum
mechanics in connection with the reduction of the wave function in the
measurement process.

 there is a well-known doubling problem in the formulation of fermionic
elds on a discretised space-time lattice. the soliton model of fermions
resolves this problem by treating them as extended objects.

there remain of course many open questions in connection with this topo-

logical model of fermions. some of them were already mentioned.

 it is not yet clear whether the running of the coupling, the dependence of
the strength of the interaction on the transfered momentum, is described
quantitatively correct.

 there are many questions in connection with the spin properties of solitons
and their interaction with an external electro-magnetic eld. it seems that
this model predicts that no stern-gerlach experiments for the fundamental
solitons are possible. furthermore it should be claried if the interaction
of singlet and triplet positronium states with an external magnetic eld is
adequately described.

 the structure of excited positronium states with non-zero angular momen-
tum must be studied and the decay properties of positronium states have
to be compared with the experimental predictions. in our model singlet
positronium can annihilate without topological restrictions, since its wind-
ing number is zero. in the quantum eld theoretical description it decays
via one-photon emission, whereas triplet positronium decays via three-
photon emission. in our model triplet positronium has winding number
two. its decay is inhibited and the appropriate mechanism for its decay
is still unclear.

 we studied a special form of the potential energy density hp. there are
other forms possible which lead to nite energy predictions. since the
prediction of the spectrum of charged leptons seems not to be in very
good agreement with the experiment, one should possibly think about
other dependences.

 a more general question concerns the extension of the model to higher
groups treating other types of interactions. it seems quite clear that an

22

extension to su (3) should be used to describe the colour force inside
strongly interacting particles. according to the standard model, w-bosons
are the gauge bosons of the weak interaction. one could speculate that w-
bosons, as they have a denite mass, are not quanta of fundamental elds
but rather analogons of pions, i.e. topological excitations of an su (4)- or
su (5)-eld.

 baryons in an su (3)-model should most likely not be described by three
separated fundamental objects, the quarks, rather by topological stable
su (3) eld congurations describing the whole baryon. this would lead
to an explanation of connement by intrinsic topological properties of the
gluon eld. there would be no need for a non-trivial vacuum, a picture
which is used in quantum chromo dynamics.

 a deep puzzle concerns the structure of neutrinos. originally the author
believed that neutrinos are connected with even winding numbers of the
quaternion eld. but this idea turned out to be erroneous. it is not yet
clear how neutrinos should be included in some version of this topological
model of fermions.

if some version of this model should turn out to be a good candidate for
the description of fundamental particles it should be compatible with quantum
mechanics. via the path integral formulation of quantum mechanics this should
be easily possible.

the dierential geometrical formulation of this model seems to give a nat-
ural possibility for the inclusion of general relativity. but it is not clear how a
gravitational 1/r2-force could appear between neutral particles. better under-
standable seems a variation of the speed of light in matter and a deection of
plane electro-magnetic waves by solitons.
