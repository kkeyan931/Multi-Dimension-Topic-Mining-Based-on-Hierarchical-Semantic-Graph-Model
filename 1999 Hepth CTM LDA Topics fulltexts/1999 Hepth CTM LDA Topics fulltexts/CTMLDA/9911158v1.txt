abstract

we compute the one-loop divergences of d = 10, n = 1 supergravity and of its reduction to
d = 8. we study the tensor structure of the counterterms appearing in d = 8 and d = 10 and
compare these to expressions previously found in the low energy expansion of string theory. the
innities have the primitive yang-mills tree amplitude as a common factor.

introduction

highly extended supergravity theories have long been seen as potential theories of quantum gravity
although they were displaced by superstring theories [1] as favored candidates for a nal theory.
the (quantum) m theory has 10 dimensional supergravities as low energy limits and might be thought
of either as a (non-perturbative) quantum version of eleven dimensional supergravity (including its
extended solutions) or as a non-perturbative completion of superstring theories. the spectacular
perturbative ultra-violet niteness of string theories indicates that strings provide a physical reg-
ulator of supergravities in 10 dimensions. in this paper we shall explore the ultra-violet behavior
of d = 10 , n = 1 supergravity and its dimensional descendants from a eld theory viewpoint. in
this we are attempting to work-up to the quantum theory of gravity rather than work down from
string theory.

of the extended supergravities two play a central role. firstly, there is the d = 11, n = 1
maximally extended theory [2] which reduces to n = 8 in d = 4 [3]. in some ways this theory is
the ultimate conventional point-particle eld theory. the one-loop amplitude is potentially innite
for d  8 although in dimensional regularisation it is only innite for d = 8 (in the dimensional
regularisation prescription one-loop amplitudes in odd dimensions are nite and the d = 10 innity
vanishes onshell). we shall work entirely within the dimensional reduction scheme this being the
most appropriate to study an anomaly-free supersymmetric theory.

at two-loops innities have been calculated in the amplitudes for d  7 [4] (including the d = 11
case. the eleven dimensional counterterm was subsequently evaluated in ref. [5]). the expectation
is that this theory will be perturbatively innite in four dimensions [6].

in this paper we shall examine features of the other interesting extended supergravity. this is the
d = 10, n = 1 theory and its dimensional reduction descendants which include the d = 4, n = 4
supergravity theory (with a specic matter content). this supergravity is the gravitational sector of
the low energy limit of both type i and heterotic string theories [7]. for the one-loop amplitudes we
may consider the d = 10 , n = 1 supergravity together with arbitrary matter multiplets, although
having less supersymmetry than the d = 11, n = 1 theory, it is not clear which is the most
fundamental. a web of dualities relates the various string theories and if one introduces for instance
the appropriate gauge group so(32) in the type i matter sector, this choice cancels the gravitational
and gauge anomalies. when compactied to d  10 type i and type ii theories give rise to very
special and similar symmetry groups. in fact it can be argued that these duality symmetries that have
gained importance together with the realisation of the overwhelming necessity of non-perturbative
eects are not that dierent between type i and type ii supergravities. the tantalizing e10 is closely
related to the hyperbolic kac-moody algebra obtained from the extrapolation of the chamseddine-
sen sequence [8] namely the hyperbolic extension of d8. in fact the symmetry groups of type i are
xed point sets under an involution of those of type ii for all dimensions (at least three); this was
mentioned in [9] and relies on kacs description of the automorphisms of simple lie algebras which
can be found for instance in [10] .

clearly, the extended supergravities can only be uv nite if they possess symmetries which we
do not fully understand yet, the implications of which will be at the non-perturbative level, or at

1

least will require novel renormalisation techniques. consequently, if these symmetries are operative
at all, they should be approximately as powerful for type i and ii theories. and one could infer from
this that the structure of divergences should be somehow related in both theories which are two dual
perturbative expansions. one should keep in mind though that the relation is nonperturbative.

the explicit (perturbative) calculation we shall perform is four graviton scattering at one-loop
for d  4. this will enable us to evaluate r4 counterterms. for the one-loop amplitudes we may
consider the d = 10, n = 1 supergravity multiplet with arbitrary matter, we shall call it type i
slightly abusively. although the theory will only be free from gravitational anomalies in d = 10 for
special gauge groups, for d = 8 , 10 the gravitational anomalies only manifest themselves in the ve
or six graviton amplitude. furthermore the contribution is parity odd and nite whereas we shall
consider divergences.

before calculating the counterterms, we shall calculate the entire amplitudes (including their
nite part) and at rst for a particular choice of external helicities - namely in the case where the
external polarisation vectors are forced to be four dimensional. with this simplication it is possible
to present the amplitude in a very elegant form as the sum over a few simple integral functions.
from these amplitudes we can easily see the presence of ultra-violet innities in d = 8 , 10.

unlike the situation in four dimensions, there are onshell independent r4 tensors in dimension
d  8, so in d = 8 the counterterms are not determined by single coecients and it requires
a full computation of the amplitude to x their form. we nd a beautiful factorisation of the
innite counterterms in the amplitude into a product of left times right kinematic factors in a
manner very reminiscent of the relationships between gravity and yang-mills presented in ref. [4].
the factorisation can be understood from a string theory viewpoint but remains more obscure for
eld theorists. oshell this factorisation is also not obvious at all from examining the eld theory
counterterms although the counterterms can be manipulated to reect it.

2 d dimensional amplitudes with helicities in four dimensions

as a simple case, we rst study amplitudes where the helicity of the external gravitons are restricted
to lie in the four-dimensional space dened by the momenta. in this situation we can calculate the
entire amplitude in a fairly simple form by breaking the amplitude into its helicity components.
even with the external helicities specied there are dierent contributions depending upon which
supermultiplet is circulating in the internal loop. one may label the possible loop contributions
according to the circulating four dimensional supermultiplets. the three contributions we shall
distinguish are that from a n = 8 multiplet, that from a n = 6 matter multiplet and nally that
from a n = 4 matter multiplet.
in terms of these contributions the (pure) n = 4 supergravity
one-loop amplitude is

m n =4 = m n =8  4m n =6,matter + 2m n =4,matter

(2.1)

2

also, of more interest to us is the n = 4 one-loop amplitude for the dimensional reduction of
n = 1, d = 10 supergravity to four dimensions which is

m n =4 = m n =8  4m n =6,matter + 8m n =4,matter

(2.2)

it is often the case that nonmaximally supersymmetric theories do not remain irreducible upon
dimensional reduction.
if we consider the n = 4 (or type i) supergravity coupled to n = 4
super-yang-mills matter the corresponding amplitude is

m n =4,g = m n =8  4m n =6,matter + (8 + dimg)m n =4,matter

(2.3)

where dimg is the dimension of the gauge group. let us call g the combination g = (8 + dimg).
we have chosen to organize our amplitudes conveniently as linear combinations of the three super-
multiplet contributions.

for d = 10 the three independent supersymmetric contributions are for instance the n = 8 and
the n = 4 contributions as well as the matter n = 4 term. these have in turn reductions below 10
dimensions. if the external polarisations are forced to be four dimensional then the external gravitons
have  helicity. there are then only three independent helicity amplitudes, m (1+, 2+, 3+, 4+),
m (1, 2+, 3+, 4+) and m (1, 2, 3+, 4+). (we choose a convention where all particles are considered
outgoing.) in any supersymmetric theory,

m (1+, 2+, 3+, 4+) = m (1, 2+, 3+, 4+) = 0

(2.4)

and the only non-zero independent amplitude is m (1, 2, 3+, 4+). we have calculated our ampli-
tudes using string-based rules [11, 12, 13, 14], (see appendix a) and veried the four-dimensional
expressions using unitarity techniques. the details are presented in appendix b. the amplitudes are
all regulated using dimensional reduction [15] with parameter  = (d  d)/2.

calculating the n = 8 amplitude gives

where i d
4 (s, t) denotes the d-dimensional scalar box integral function with ordering of legs 1234,
s, t and u are the usual mandelstam variables. the n-point scalar amplitude with external legs ki

where we have expressed the amplitude using a spinor helicity representation of the polarisation
tensors. spinor helicity techniques [17] were introduced for qcd calculation but by splitting the
polarisation tensor

 = 

(2.11)

they can be applied to gravity calculations also [18, 19].

these amplitudes are complete. they contain a great deal of information but in particular we
can simply extract their ultra-violet innities. since we are using dimensional regularisation the
one-loop integrals are only divergent in even dimensions. for a four point amplitude the expected
counterterm is of the r4 type which can only appear for d  8 at one-loop.

for the n = 8 amplitude the form of the amplitude is manifestly nite for d < 8 since scalar
box integrals are only divergent for d  8. extracting the divergences for d = 8 and d = 10 from
the integrals yields

2(cid:19)2
m n =8,d=82 = (cid:18) 

m n =8,d=102 = 0

the d = 10 one-loop amplitude is onshell-convergent within dimensional regularisation since the
integrals give  (s + t + u) = 0. a cut-o regularisation would give a non-zero result proportional to
(2.13)

2  stum tree

which leads to the well known [20, 21, 22, 23] counterterm 2t8t8r4.
within dimensional regularisation the two-loop amplitude is the rst divergence [4].

(t8 will be dened later.)

for the remaining two amplitudes we can evaluate the innities in these expressions quite easily.
the expressions are manifestly convergent for d < 6 for the n = 6 contribution and d < 4 for the

4

n = 4 one. extracting the divergences we nd

m n =6,matter,d=62(1, 2, 3+, 4+) = 0

m n =4,matter,d=62(1, 2, 3+, 4+) = 0

in both cases the d = 6 counterterm vanishes. in d = 6 the expected counterterm is r3. however
there is no supersymmetrisable r3 counterterm and amplitudes contain no innities. this is exactly
the reason why the two-loop innity vanishes in d = 4 supergravity.

finally, recombining these poles to give the full physical amplitude with four dimensional helic-

ities within type i supergravity we nd

although these amplitudes are indicative of the divergences present they are not sucient to
determine completely the structure of the counterterms in higher dimensions. for example in d = 8

5

there are 7 independent r4 tensors (onshell) compared to 2 in d = 4. when restricting the external
helicities and momenta to d = 4 naturally we loose most of the information. so to determine the
exact counterterms we must calculate with arbitrary external helicity. this we shall do for d = 8 , 10
in the following sections. we can also immediately see one interesting fact. for n = 4 the d = 10
divergence does not cancel - unlike in the n = 8 case. this implies that the counterterms must have
a dierent r4 structure. we shall explore this further also.

let us conclude the present section with the remark that the strange coecients appearing in
the above formulas will actually be more reasonable looking in the higher dimensional amplitudes
and result from the collapse of several invariants onto the same expression in lower dimension.

3 d = 8 counterterms

in this section we move on from the complete amplitudes and focus upon their innity structure. we
will relax our restriction to four dimensional helicities and obtain the innity in the amplitudes in
d = 8 , 10 for arbitrary external polarisations. these amplitudes were calculated using the string-
based method of ref. [11, 13, 14]. in this section we examine the d = 8 innity structure. the
dimensional reduction of d = 10 , n = 1 to d = 8 is d = 8 , n = 1 supergravity [24] plus matter.
in d = 8 the potential one-loop counterterm is an r4 tensor. this is analogous to the situation
in d = 4 at three loops where a potential r4 term exists for n = 1 supergravity [6]. however,
four dimensions is rather special because many of the potentially inequivalent r4 tensors become
equivalent at low dimensions. in fact, and as alluded to above, from the potential seven tensors
onshell (actually six remain after integration by parts) only two are inequivalent in four dimensions.
of these only one is compatible with supersymmetry - this is the well known bel-robinson tensor [25].
however for d  8 all seven tensors are inequivalent and the structure of r4 tensors is much richer.
the supersymmetrisability has been discussed in [26].

forgetting about supersymmetry we know from [27] that a general r4 tensor in d = 8 is

a1t1 + a2t2 + a3t3 + a4t4 + a5t5 + a6t6 + a7t7

(3.1)

where

t7 =rp,q,r,srp,t,r,urt,v,q,wru,v,s,w

(3.2)

these are onshell the independent tensors (actually the riemann tensor means the weyl tensor here)
and the combination

in order to calculate the appropriate n = 8 counterterm we evaluate the (on-shell) amplitude

and we nd it factorises in the following way:

(3.5)

(3.6)

where  denotes symmetrisation over the four indices 1234. the factorisation is easily understood
if one regards n = 8 supergravity as the low energy limit of string theory, however it is much
more obscure from a eld theory viewpoint. in fact the tensor k1 appears in string tree and loop
amplitudes. (see ref. [1] eqs. (7.4.42) and (9.a.19) ). its appearance in many diverse calculations is
presumably due to the uniqueness of a tensor compatible with maximal supersymmetry.

the counterterm necessary to cancel this innity is,

which appears in the derivative expansion of the m -theory eective action ( [1, 22] ). the tensor t8
is dened in [1], here we drop its antisymmetric part. the reason why t8 appears in trees as well as
loops is connected to the form of the vertex operators and to triality.

calculating with the (formal) n = 6 , matter counterterm we nd the innity has the same

tensor structure and is

we can relate this also to specic tensors contracted against r4. the tensor t8 can be split into
two pieces t(12) and t(48) each having the same symmetry properties as t8. the tensors t(12) and t(48)
contain 12 and 48 quartic monomials in the s respectively. they are the only two tensors which
have the same symmetry properties of t8 itself in eight dimensions [1]. specically

this second tensor structure has also played a role in the low energy limit of string theory, although
in this case that of heterotic or type i string theory. it has appeared in the ten dimensional eective
action as seen by [32, 33, 34] both as a string tree and one-loop correction. again the string
formulation of tree amplitudes and thus of the appropriate invariant tensors gives an understanding
of the factorisation of the amplitude which does not have a simple interpretation in eld theory. one
checks easily that 5a + 4b  c contains a t8 factor. the counterterm is also supersymmetrisable
as shown in [26] where the most general lagrangians of the form r + r4 were considered (without
vector multiplets).

the innities can be canceled by specic combinations of 2r4 counterterms. once more we nd
local lorentz invariant counterterms to cancel the innities. as a working hypothesis we assumed
factorisability to make this tractable. the strategy is to calculate arbitrary onshell scalars of the
form 2f 4 times the previous t8f 4, to deduce from the resulting three parameter expression for the

10

amplitude the values of these coecients and nally to replace the two polynomial solutions in the
f s by the corresponding invariants in the fourth order in the riemann tensor. (onshell equivalent
to the weyl tensor at this order.) as is explained in detail in appendix c we may choose to express
the counterterms in terms of the following set of tensors,

s1 =(rp,q,r,srp,q,r,s)(rp,q,r,srp,q,r,s)
s2 =(rp,q,r,srp,q,r,t)(rp,q,r,srp,q,r,t)
s3 =(rp,q,r,srp,q,r,t)(rp,q,r,srp,q,r,t)
s4 =rp,q,r,srp,q,t,urt,u,v,wrr,s,v,w
s5 =rp,q,r,srp,q,t,urr,t,v,wrs,u,v,w
s6 =rp,q,r,srp,q,t,urr,v,t,wrs,v,u,w
s7 =rp,q,r,srp,t,r,urt,v,u,wrq,v,s,w

s10 =pra,b,l,mqra,b,r,srq,d,l,rrp,d,m,s

(4.10)

for s1 to s8 the derivatives are contracted with each other and these sis are related to derivatives
acting upon the tis of the previous sections. tensors s9 and s10 however have the derivatives
contracted into the riemann tensors. of course many tensors of the form 2r4 vanish onshell since
they produce amplitudes of the form

2r4 tensor which must be d = 10, n = 1 supersymmetrisable. presumably the vanishing of the
m n =8,d=10 is because no d = 10, n = 2 supersymmetrisable 2r4 tensor exists.

the counterterms for d = 10, n = 1 supergravities are given by linear combinations of the

various m d=10 and in fact the innities are given by k1pi cili since the various innities factorise

in this way. at the level of the counterterms, all type i supergravity divergences contain the factor
t8.

5 conclusions

in this letter we have determined the one-loop ultra-violet behavior of the dimensional reductions
of d = 10 , n = 1 supergravity. we have examined this by calculations involving physical on-
shell (four-point) amplitudes. we have found a variety of results; some in complete agreement with
expectations but some not so obvious from the eld theory viewpoint. as expected, the amplitudes
are one-loop nite for d < 8. for d  8 there is a richer structure. in d = 8 we nd innities which
correspond to r4 counterterms and we have completely determined the r4 structure. in d = 4
the structure of r4 terms is fairly simple; there are only two independent tensors of which one is
compatible with supersymmetry - the well known bel-robinson combination [25]. for d  8,
there are seven independent tensors. for the d = 8 , n = 1 theory supersymmetry is less restrictive
than for d = 8 , n = 2 and this allows a further r4 counterterm, in fact we do nd innities
belonging to a new tensor structure.

within dimensional regularisation, d = 10 counterterms to a four-point innity are of the form
2r4. the vanishing of the d = 10, n = 2 one-loop innity is presumably due to the non-
existence of a supersymmetric combination of 2r4 counterterms (which does not vanish onshell.)
for d = 10, n = 1 we do however nd a 2r4 counterterm which is non-zero.

an interesting feature of the amplitudes (so far checked up to 1-loop level) is factorisation. for
the d = 8 counterterms one nds that the innities in the amplitude factorise as k1  k2 where the
ka are combinations of the external i and ki. similarly the d = 10 counterterms factorise as k1l2.
this factorisation is far from manifest when examining the counterterms however. regarding the
amplitudes as arising from the low energy limit of string theory, this factorisation is the remnant of
the string factorisation into left and right moving amplitudes. however, it should be noted that the
string factorisation occurs within the loop momentum integral whereas the factorisation of innity
occurs in the amplitude.

the factorisation is expected whenever the tree corrections generate the same invariants. however
the factorisation of the amplitudes is unexpected from a eld theory viewpoint and is hinting towards
an alternate description of gravity theories as a product of two yang-mills theories - as suggested
in [4, 19]. although such a formalism is natural in string theory it might well exist in a purely eld
theoretic context.

the counterterm structures we nd are related to terms appearing in various places in string the-
ory. this is not surprising since string theory provides a physical regularisation of supergravity. also
string/m theory shares many symmetries with supergravity theory and hence counterterms/eective
actions are subject to the same constraints. in the present work we have calculated purely within a
eld theory context. the structures we nd are presumably inherent to any regulator of supergravity
whether a string theory or a more conventional one.

a calculations

we have calculated using the string-based techniques, originally developed for yang-mills calcula-
tions [11, 35, 12] and then applied to gravity calculations [13, 14]. although originating in string
theory the same formalism was subsequently shown to arise from a world-line approach to eld the-
ory [31]. we refer the reader to these papers for the details of the technique, here merely presenting
the results for our amplitudes.

the techniques provide a formalism for obtaining the feynman parameter integrals for on-shell
amplitudes. the initial step is to draw all 3 diagrams, excluding tadpoles. there is no need to
include diagrams with a loop isolated on an external leg since these vanish when dimensional regu-
larisation is used. the external legs of these diagrams should be labeled, with diagrams containing
all orderings included. the inner lines of trees attached to the loop are labeled according to the rule
that as one moves from the outer lines to the inner ones, one labels the inner line with the same
label as the most clockwise of the two outer lines attached to it. the contribution from each labeled
n-point 3-like diagram with n legs attached to the loop is

to the loop, xij  xi  xj. the xim are related to ordinary feynman parameters by xim =pm

j=1 aj.
kred is the reduced kinematic factor, which the string-based rules eciently yield in a compact
form. the lines attached to the loop carry momenta pi which will be o-shell if there is a tree
attached to that line.

one obtains kred by applying substitution rules to an overall kinematic factor,

function with respect to left-moving variables, and gb and gb are derivatives with respect to right-

split into left-moving and right-moving.) the term h ij
b is the derivative of the green function
with respect to one left mover and one right mover variable. the functions gij
b are to
taken as symmetric in the i and j indices while gb is antisymmetric. although the above expression
contains much information in string theory, when one takes the innite string tension limit it should
merely be regarded as a function which contains all the information necessary to generate kred
for all graphs. the utility of the string based method partially lies in this compact representation
(which is valid for arbitrary numbers of legs!). the existence of an overall function which reduces
to the feynman parameter polynomial for each diagram is one of the most useful features of the
string-based rules.

slightly dierent substitutions rules are used depending upon particle type. the technique
is particularly simple for supersymmetric theories where the cancellations between particle types
circulating are manifest.

in general in gravity theories, in a one-loop n-point amplitude the amplitude is a sum over
diagrams with n legs attached to the loop where n  n. for these diagrams the integrand is a
polynomial of the feynman parameters of degree 2n. the overlying kinematic expression is of the
form p kl  kr. the substitutions act upon kl and kr independently - each being up to n

powers of feynman parameters. for a given particle circulating in the loop the substitution is of
the form

kl/r  s + cp

(a.3)

where s denotes a part common to all particle types and cp is a cycle contribution which de-
in general s is of degree n whereas cp is typically n  2 or less.
pends upon particle type.
bosonic/fermionic particles have a s term. in a supersymmetric theory we are thus guaranteed
that the term s  s cancels and the feynman parameter integral has maximum degree n  2. for
extended supersymmetry there can be further cancellations between the cp terms and for a n-point
amplitude the degree of the polynomial is 2n  4 for n  4. for supersymmetry with n  4 the
cancellations imply that the only 3 diagrams contributing to a four point amplitude are the three
box integrals. (this is not quite obvious the cancellations occur on kl only [14] so if n = 3 for
example the kl becomes a polynomial of degree 3 4 = 1. in other words it cancels completely. )
in ref. [14] the low energy limit of string theory can be taken and the loop contributions from
the dierent particle types disentangled to obtain the contributions due to a single graviton, weyl
fermion, scalar etc. here we will be reconstructing the n = 4 amplitude again. a string theory
consists of two sectors - the neveu-schwarz sector (ns) and the ramond sector (r). these sectors
contribute in the low-energy limit

for a type ii superstring which has n = 8 supergravity as its low energy limit the contributions are
of the form

n s  8s + 2cv
r  8s  8cf

(a.4)

adds up to

we use four dimensional helicity to simplify the overall kinematic expression whereas letting the
particles circulate in any dimension 4  d  10. this is very similar to the calculations of ref. [14]
although here we let d vary from 4 to 10. the contributions we seek are for the n = 8, n = 6 and
n = 4 matter multiplets.

for the amplitudes m (1, 2, 3+, 4+) a choice of spinor helicity basis simplies the kinematic
expression enormously. spinor helicity techniques utilize a representation of the polarisation vectors
in terms of spinor products,

constant. for all three boxes this coecient is simple as cv  4cf  1/2 and we nd the amplitude
is just a sum over scalar box integrals with the overall factor [stum tree].
step 2 the m n =6.

in the language of [14] we want the contribution of the form

applying the substitution rules we obtain,

as has been observed before, [37], the amplitudes with less supersymmetry have the dimensions of
the box integrals shifted relative to the maximal supersymmetric case.

at this point we should discuss which string theory is relevant. in the original work on string-
based rules the low energy limit of a heterotic string theory was taken to obtain the rules. later
it was realised that the same information could be encoded within a formalism where the fermionic
sectors were dropped [28]. one of the challenges in developing this technique was to break the
link between the string theory and the eld theory limit allowing calculations in more general eld
theories such as non-supersymmetric qcd to be performed [29].

in our work we are focusing on n = 4 supergravity which is the low energy limit of heterotic
string theory and as such the string based rules recombine and simplify. n = 4 supergravity is
of course the eld theory limit of two of the fundamental string theories namely the type i theory
of open and closed strings and the heterotic string theory consisting of only closed strings. both
these string theories contain gauge groups in the low energy limit which we decouple. in the type i
theory the decoupling is extremely simple: the gauge particles are in the open string sector so the
contribution to a four graviton scattering amplitude from the n = 4 multiplet will come from the
torus and klein bottle amplitudes only. for a heterotic theory one must drop the contributions
arising from the gauge particles arising from the bosonic string.

b unitarity checks

in this section we show how the 4graviton amplitude in d = 4 may be checked by combining
unitarity and helicity techniques [38, 39, 40]. this approach provides an alternative method to
obtain part of our results and at same time a strong check of their consistency.
let us begin with the s-channel cut of the four-point amplitude m (1, 2, 3+, 4+) represented pic-
torially in g. 1. according to the cutkosky rules, it is given by

disc m 1loop(1, 2, 3+, 4+)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)scut

= iz dlip s xinternal

particles

m tree(+

1 , 1, 2, +

2 ) m tree(

2 , 3+, 4+, 
1 )

(b.1)
here dlip s denotes the usual invariant lorentz phase space and it contains an additional symmetry
factor 1/2 to keep into account that 2 identical particles are going through the cut. since we wish
to construct the entire amplitude, we observe that we can replace the phase space integral by the
cut of an unrestricted loop momentum integral

(b.2)
while eq. (b.1) includes only imaginary part, eq. (b.2) contains both real and imaginary parts.
as indicated, eq. (b.2) holds only for those terms with schannel branch cut; terms without an
schannel cut require a separate determination. a very useful feature of this identity is that we
1 = 2
are free to use the on-shell conditions 2
in fact only terms
containing no cut in this channel would change.
the only internal particles, which give a non-vanishing result in the sum in eq. (b.2), are gravitons.
fermion contributions vanish because their helicity is not ipped by the graviton vertex implying
that m (g, g, +, +) = 0. the same holds for vector and scalar amplitudes at tree level (taking
particle/antiparticle instead of positive/negative helicity in the latter). ( on a more formal ground,
this follows from susy and chiral ward identities [41].) thus in our decomposition only the n = 8
supermultiplet will produce a non-vanishing scut, while the n = 6 and n = 4 supermultiplets will
have only t/ucuts. let us focus on the former case.

the t- and u-channel cuts require essentially the same calculations since the helicity conguration
are the same in both cases. we shall focus on the t-channel case and deduce the u-channel result
from this by permuting (1  2). in this case the possible helicity congurations of the trees are
those represented in g. 3. since helicity is no longer ipped on either tree, the cut receives a
non-vanishing contribution from each of the supermultiplet.

the contribution to the t-cut from states in the self-conjugate supermultiplet with n supersymme-

the above sum can be performed by recalling that all amplitudes are related, via supersymmetric
ward identities (see refs. [41]), to the scalar one according to the relations

m tree(g, g, g+, g+) = y4m tree(g, , +, g+)
m tree(g, , +, g+) = y3m tree(g, , +, g+)
m tree(g, a, a+, g+) = y2m tree(g, , +, g+)
m tree(g, , +, g+) = ym tree(g, , +, g+)

(b.8)

where y = h1 2i /h1 3i and g, , a,  and  denote the graviton, the gravitino, the vector, the spin
1/2 and the scalar respectively. using, in fact, the relations (b.8) we can rearrange eq. (b.7) to be,

the term n is a kinematical factor that encodes the sum over the dierent particles, while m tree is,
in this case, the amplitude for two scalars into two gravitons, whose explicit form can be obtained
by combining eq. (b.8) with eq. (b.3).

here, as in the case of the scut, we have factorized out the tree amplitude and reduced everything
to scalar products.

therefore, we are led to write the following master-formula that encompasses all the possible con-

the remarks made after eq. (b.2) are also valid here. in particular we are free to turn the scalar
products appearing in the denominator of eq. (b.14) into propagators, when it is convenient.
the n = 8 contribution is selected by choosing m = 4.
in this case, using the same procedure
adopted for the schannel, we can turn eq. (b.14) into a sum of boxes. we nd a very similar result
except that s  t.
by posing m = 3, we are led to compute the n = 6 contribution. the rst step is to expand the

n = 8 and n = 6 amplitudes were cut-constructible, namely their exact one-loop expression could
be deduced using unitarity [38, 39, 40], the n = 4 is not and only the cut expressions are guaranteed

c form of the counterterms and factorisation of the divergences

the aim of the present appendix is to express each factor appearing in the 1/ poles of the d = 8 and
d = 10 amplitudes in terms of lorentz invariants in the product of four gauge eldstrengths fab
and their derivatives. one of the advantages of this analysis was to suggest a natural (and correct)
form for the 2r4 invariants entering the expression of our counterterm in d = 10. this would have
been otherwise a hard task since the number of independent 2r4 invariants in d = 10 dimensions
which do not vanish onshell is more than 30 [27]. at the end we shall briey comment on a possible
superstring interpretation of the observed factorization of the counterterms, which actually extends
to the complete 1-loop amplitude as well.

it is useful to express the riemann tensor in terms of the symmetrized product of two eld

strengths:

1

rab,cd =

2 (cid:0)fab fcd + fabfcd(cid:1)
fab  k[a  b] ; fab  k[a  b]

the vector polarizations a and b being related to the graviton polarization ab through a traceless
symmetrized product: ab = (ab). as shown in sections 3 and 4, the d = 8 counterterms we nd
are of the form k1  kj and similarly the d = 10 counterterms have the factorized form k1  lj
(j = 1, 2). as we shall show below, each of the factors can be expressed as a suitable invariant in
the product of four vector eldstrengths fab and their derivatives.
in particular, in the d = 8
case we nd that the factors ki are two independent invariants constructed contracting suitable
combinations of the tensors t(12) and t(48) with four gauge eld strengths fab.
if we dene:

n1 = 
1
n2 =
48
we can express k1 and k2 as follows:

t(12)  f 4 = (fabf ab)(fcdf cd)

1
12
t(48)  f 4 = fa

bfb

cfc

dfd

a

(c.1)

(c.2)

k1 =

k2 = 

1

16(cid:16)n1  4n2) = 
16(cid:16)5n1 + 4n2(cid:17)

1

1
96

t8  f 4

in d = 10 we nd that the factors li in the expression of the counterterm are related to invariants
involving 2f 4 terms. there are only three independent such terms which do not vanish onshell
[30] which have the following form:

j1 =(mfabmf ab)(fcdf cd)
j2 =mfa
j3 =afm

bmfb
nbf m

cfc
nfa

dfd
pfb

a

p

in terms of the above invariants, l1 and l2 are expressed as follows:

l1 =(cid:16)5j1 + 2j2  2j3(cid:17)
l2 =(cid:16)

+ 2j2(cid:17)

j1
2

22

(c.3)

(c.4)

it is useful to express the product k1  jk in the basis of the invariants si (i = 1, . . . , 10):

1

1

1

8(cid:16)4s1 + 32s2  8s4 + 16s5(cid:17)
8(cid:16)4s2  4s3 + 4s5  8s6 + 16s7 + 8s8(cid:17)
8(cid:16)s1 + 40s3 + 10s4  12s5 + 80s6 + 32s7  80s8 + 24s9  95s10(cid:17)

k1  j1  
k1  j2  
k1  j3  
so that, multiplying by k1 and using eqs. (a.4) we nd the expression given in section 4 on the
d = 10 counterterms (n = 6 and n = 4 respectively):

(c.5)

1
4
1

k1l2  
k1l1  

s4
2

+ 0.s5 + 2s6  4s7  2s8

s1 + 3s2 + s3 
8(cid:16)18s1 + 152s2  88s3  60s4 + 112s5  176s6  32s7 + 176s8  48s9 + 190s10(cid:17)(c.6)

we found it useful also to express k1  j3 in a dierent basis of invariants ml:

k1  j3  4m1  16m2  16m3 + 4m4  16m5 + 4m6

(c.7)

where

m1 = aref lmdref nordhnorhalm
m2 = aref lmdref nordhmorhaln
m3 = aref lodref nordhnmrhalm
m4 = aref lmdref nordhlmrhano
m5 = aref lodref nordhlmrhanm
m6 = aref modref mordhlnrhaln

(c.8)

the expression of k1j3 in terms of the tensors ml is related through (torsion) bianchi identities
to its expression in terms of the si. the rst two equations in (a.5) expressing k1  j1,2 in terms
of si (i = 1, . . . , 8) and (a.7) expressing k1  j3 in terms of the ml (l = 1, . . . , 6) can be derived
directly by writing the three k1  ji in the following more compact way:

k1  ji = djit8  2r4

djit8  2r4  da1a2a3a4a5a6a7a8a9a10
and the 10tensor dji is dened as follows:

ji

t8b1b2b3b4b5b6b7b8a1ra2a3

b1b2a4 ra5a6

b3b4ra7a8

b5b6ra9a10

b7b8

da1a2a3a4a5a6a7a8a9a10
j1
da1a2a3a4a5a6a7a8a9a10
j2
da1a2a3a4a5a6a7a8a9a10
j3

= a1a4a2a5 a3a6a7a9a8a10
= a1a4a2a10 a3a5a6a7a8a9
= a1a10 a2a5a3a6a4a7a8a9

(c.9)

the observed factorization of the n = 1 and n = 2 counterterms is consistent with the interpretation
of these theories as lowenergy limits of suitable closed superstring theories (heterotic and type ii
respectively).
indeed, as it was shown above, each factor in the expression of the counterterms
can be written in terms of invariants within suitable gauge theories. these gauge theories may be
thought of as describing the lowenergy excitations of the open string theories associated with the

23

left (l) and right (r) movers of some closed string. from this point of view the factorization of
the counterterms (and of the whole amplitudes) would seem quite natural:
it is well known that
the free fock space of a closed string theory is the tensor product of the two open string fock
spaces corresponding to the (l) and(r) movers, moreover, retrieving the supergravity amplitudes
from the  expansion of closed string amplitudes (that is using superstring theory as a regulator of
the eective supergravity theory), up to oneloop order the contributions from the two sectors are
expected to factorise. however we wish to emphasize that the philosophy underlying our work is not
to go from superstring theory downwards, that is to study supergravity as its eective low energy
theory, but on the contrary to move from eld theory upwards and to study its eective action
within a qft framework, using dimensional reduction as a regularisation scheme, instead of string
theory. from the eld theory point of view the observed factorization is a highly non trivial result,
consistent with the interpretation of the supergravities with 32 and 16 supercharges as low energy
theories of type ii and heterotic superstring theories respectively. in particular the dierent forms
of the counterterms in the maximal and non maximal cases may be related, in this perspective, to
dierent supersymmetry constraints holding on the two sectors of the closed string theory. more
specically our results seem to suggest that in an open string sector the only possible invariants
in four fab consistent with an n = 1 supersymmetry have to be constructed by saturating the
indices of the eld strengths with a t8 tensor. this condition would restrict the possible invariants
(non vanishing onshell) in four fab and at most two derivatives, to just one possibility, namely
k1  t8  f 4. indeed if we interpret the maximal supergravity as the low energy limit of type ii
superstring, which has an n = 1 supersymmetry on both the (l) and (r) sectors, according to the
above positions the only onshell non vanishing counterterm is the one found in d = 8 (with no
derivatives), which is indeed proportional to k1  k1. as far as the theory with 16 supercharges is
concerned, it may be interpreted as the low energy eective theory of the heterotic superstring, which
has an n = 1 supersymmetry on one sector (l) and an n = 0 on the other (r). again, consistently
with our results and the above considerations, we can associate the k1 factor of the corresponding
counterterms in d = 8 and d = 10 with the sector (l) constrained by supersymmetry.
