abstract

in contrast with the classical gauge group cases, any method to prove exactly the

scaling relation which relates moduli and prepotential is not known in the case of

exceptional gauge groups. this paper provides a direct method to establish this

relation by using picard-fuchs equations. in particular, it is shown that the scaling

relation found by ito in n = 2 supersymmetric g2 yang-mills theory actually holds

exactly.

i. introduction

it would be one of the greatest discoveries in 1990s that the holomorphic structure of the low

energy eective prepotential of n = 2 supersymmetric yang-mills theory in four dimensions was ac-

tually related with the moduli space of a riemann surface which possesses singularities when charged

particles become massless. according to this mechanism found by seiberg and witten,1 the eective

theory is parameterized by the vacuum expectation value of scalar components  of n = 1 chiral

multiplet, which can be identied with periods of a certain meromorphic dierential on the rie-

mann surface, and accordingly the prepotential can be determined exactly also including instanton

corrections. for example, for classical gauge group cases, the prepotential is known to be dictated

by hyperelliptic curves,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11 and instanton corrections to the prepotential obtained from

these curves showed a good agreement with the so-called instanton calculus,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19 a pure

eld theoretical method.

these hyperelliptic curves were also derived from a very dierent view point, relation to inte-

grable systems.20,21,22 in the language of integrable system, these hyperelliptic curves coincide with

the spectral curves (the characteristic equation for lax matrix) and the periods can be interpreted

as the action integrals. this interpretation explains why the eective theory is solvable, and from

this fact, it may be natural to expect that also for exceptional gauge group cases the relevant

curves are given by hyperelliptic curves. in fact, several hyperelliptic curves for such cases were

constructed,10,23,24 but, unfortunately, in general, the spectral curves from integrable systems for

exceptional gauge group cases can not be transformed into hyperelliptic form. for instance, the

curve for g2 gauge theory is related to the (g(1)

2 ) toda system,21,25 and is given in the form

3(cid:18)z 



z(cid:19)2

 x8 + 2ux6 (cid:20)u2 + 6(cid:18)z +



z(cid:19)(cid:21) x4 +(cid:20)v + 2u(cid:18)z +



z(cid:19)(cid:21) x2 = 0,

(1.1)

where x is the eigenvalue of the lax operator matrix, z is the spectral parameter, u and v are

gauge invariant casimirs called moduli (of the eective theory) and  is a parameter which leads

to the dynamical scale, but obviously this curve can not be transformed into hyperelliptic form.

of course, for these two formulations, which one is better must be decided by a comparison of

instanton corrections to prepotential with that from instanton calculus. according to the result,26

there is a manifest dierence between prepotentials from these two curves and only that from (1.1)

derivation of scaling relation

can survive! similar result follows also in e6 gauge theory,27 and therefore the substance of complex

curves relevant to gauge theories is believed as a spectral curve of integrable system.

as a characteristic common problem concerning to these gauge theories with exceptional lie

groups, we can mention that the exact establishment of scaling relation28,29,30,31,32 of prepotential

f whose general form is typically represented in the form

ai

f
ai

gxi=1

 2f = htr 2i,

(1.2)

where g is the rank of the gauge group, ai are the periods and  is the coecient of one-loop beta

function, is very hard. although the formula (1.2) has been checked in the standpoint of instanton

calculus in the su(2) gauge theory,33,34 as for a general proof of this formula for theories with any

classical gauge groups, we know the method30 based on whitham hierarchy.35 in such cases, the

curves are hyperelliptic, and thus the verication of (1.2) can be done directly, but in contrast with

these cases, for theories with exceptional gauge groups, similar discussions do not exist because of

too complicated singularity structure of the spectral curves. for instance, in the case of the g2

theory, we can explicitly see this from (1.1), which is actually an eight cover of z-plane.

on one hand, of course, there are strong supports for this formula (1.2) in exceptional gauge

group cases and the validity of (1.2) was explicitly checked by rst several instanton process levels

with the help of explicit solutions to picard-fuchs equations,26,27,36 but this does not mean that

(1.2) holds exactly. then, also in the theories with exceptional groups, does (1.2) hold exactly? to

answer this question is the subject of this paper.

in this paper, we give a method to verify (1.2) exactly for g2 gauge theory, although the method

itself is applicable for all theories with any classical and exceptional gauge groups with or without

massive hypermultiplets. our starting point is to consider the dierentiated versions of (1.2), dened

by

w =

2xi=1

(aiuadi  adiuai), w =

2xi=1

(aivadi  adivai),

(1.3)

and seek dierential equations for (1.3). as a matter of fact, this can be proceeded by considering

picard-fuchs equations, but since the picard-fuchs equations with multiple moduli are usually real-

ized as a set of partial dierential equations,37,38 actually such equations do not have any advantages

for a study of scaling relation of prepotential (in higher rank gauge groups), although the derivation

derivation of scaling relation

4

using partial dierential form of picard-fuchs equations was tried in the case of su(3).39 however,

if picard-fuchs equations represented by single kind of moduli derivatives can be found, we can

easily construct an ordinary dierential equation for respective quantities in (1.3). in addition, the

basis of solutions to such ordinary dierential equation can be uniquely xed, so as the result, we

can determine the right hand side of (1.2) by taking an appropriate initial condition.

ii. picard-fuchs equations in g2 theory

a. g2 picard-fuchs equations

to begin with, let us recall the seiberg-witten meromorphic dierential on the g2 curve (1.1)

given by

and the denition of periods

 = x

dz
z

ai =ii

,

adi =ii

,

i = 1, 2,

(2.1)

(2.2)

where i and i are the canonical cycles on (1.1). some of the properties of these period integrals

were discussed by masuda et al..40 the classical relation among periods and moduli is given by24

u = a2

2 + (a1  a2)2 + (a1  2a2)2,

v = a2

2(a1  a2)2(a1  2a2)2.

(2.3)

these are invariant under the action of the weyl group of g2

(a1, a2)  (3a2  a1, a2),

(a1, a2)  (a1, a1  a2).

(2.4)

then, the picard-fuchs equations can be given in the form26

" 2(720u2 + 2u3v  27v2)

the reader who wishes to know more details of picard-fuchs equations associated with non-

hyperelliptic curves may consult the work of isidro.41

from these equations, we can construct dierential equations satised by (1.3), but such dif-

ferential equations are not helpful for a direct proof of scaling relation because they are partial

dierential equations. for this reason, we seek a more convenient form of picard-fuchs equations.

a candidate is an ordinary dierential form because the right hand sides of respective quantities in

(1.3) are written in terms of only single variable derivative. therefore, if picard-fuchs equations

can take ordinary dierential forms, it would be easy to obtain ordinary dierential equations for

w and w. in addition to this, since they are ordinary dierential equations, we can uniquely x

the basis of solution space and by this it becomes possible to verify (1.2).

however, sadly, since the direct derivation of picard-fuchs equations in terms of single variable

derivatives from the original period integral requires much labour, instead, let us try to derive such

equations from (2.5).

b. ordinary dierential form of g2 picard-fuchs equations

first, let us rewrite (2.5) in the form

h2
u  c1uv  c2v  c3i  = 0,

h2
v  d1uv  d2v  d3i  = 0.

(2.6)

if there is any dierential equation satised by , it must be a linear combination of the two equations

in (2.5) and their dierentiations. we would like to make an ordinary dierential equation in terms

of single moduli derivatives, e.g., u, 2

u, etc, but in order to obtain such equation from (2.6) by

repeating dierentiations, mixed derivatives and other moduli derivatives like uv or v must be

eliminated. these irrelevant derivatives can be dropped by representing them in terms of u, uv

and v.

for example, regarding 2

uv = v(2

u), we get

2

uv =hvc1uv + vc2v + vc3 + c1u(2

v ) + c22

v + c3vi 

and further substituting 2

v  from (2.6) into this expression, we can obtain

d2

uv =hc1d3u + (c3 + c2d2 + vc2 + c1ud2)v

+(c2d1 + c1d2 + vc1 + c1ud1)uv + (c2d3 + vc3 + c1ud3)i,

(2.7)

(2.8)

derivation of scaling relation

where

d = 1  c1d1.

in a similar manner, we can arrive at

du2

v  =hd3u + (c3d1 + c2d1d2 + d1vc2 + ud2)v

+(c2d2

1 + d2 + ud1 + d1vc1)uv + (c2d1d3 + ud3 + d1vc3)i.

(2.9)

with these in remind, eliminating uv, 2

uv and u2

v , we can obtain the fourth-order ordinary

of course, a similar equation in terms of only v-derivatives can be found to follow by repeating

the same algorithm (see appendix). below, we discuss only the case for u-derivatives.

iii. differential equation for scaling relation

a. ordinary dierential equation for w

we can now construct an ordinary dierential equation satised by w . to see this, let us dene

similar quantities are often used for a calculation of yukawa couplings in the context of mirror

symmetry. notice that w itself is given by w = w01. from (3.1), we can derive some relations

among various wij

where eci are very complicated and extremely lengthy rational functions in moduli and the scaling

parameter .

b. basis of solutions

in order to obtain the basis of solutions to (3.3), especially, to determine the indicial indices, by

taking a frobenius algorithm at the weak coupling region, it would be sucient to consider (3.3)

with  = 0. this is because the weak coupling solutions can be represented also in a series of  and

the only the lowest order terms of this series are relevant in the determination of indicial indices.

then (3.3) turns to

162446987646u3v5 + 613702752390v6)iuw = 0,

and therefore we get the following set of indicial indices

for

(3.4)

(3.5)

(3.6)

according to frobenius algorithm, in general, there are two types of solutions due to the dier-

ence of two indices, one of which is a regular series and the other is logarithmic. in fact, the reader

may be familiar to the following well-known fact:

 suppose that 1 and 2 are the indicial indices to a second-order linear ordinary dierential

equation (unknown y and variable x) with regular singularities, say, at x = 0. then the

general solution is given in the form

1. y = c1x1

2. y = c1x1

xk=0
xk=0

akxk + c2x2

xk=0
akxk + c2"cx1
xk=0

bkxk,

(1  2 6= integer)

akxk ln x + x2

bkxk# ,

xk=1

(1  2 = integer),

where ci are integration constants, c is a constant to be determined according to the dierence

of the indices (typically, c = 1 when 1 = 2), ak and bk are independent of x. in both cases,

when 1 6= 2, we can assume 2 < 1 without loss of generality.

derivation of scaling relation

10

summarizing this, we can say that in any case the solution can be factored by x2 associated with

the smaller index. similar one to this fact also holds for a higher rank ordinary dierential equation

(of course, in this case, the solution may involve power of logarithm due to the dierence of indicial

indices). therefore, for (3.3), w  takes the form



w

= u1

5xi=1

iui1fi(u, v, ),

(3.7)

where i are some constants and fi are functions whose lowest order in expansion is logarithm or

function which is independent of u. integrating this gives the following function form

w = c(v) + uf,

(3.8)

where c(v) is a function which may depend on v, by using a function f whose lowest order in

expansion is logarithm or function independent of u.

in order to make a contact with the weak coupling behavior, we must impose some initial

condition. for this purpose, let us recall the denition of w in (1.3). substituting the solutions to

picard-fuchs equations into (1.3), we will be able to compare it with the right hand side of (3.8).

of course, as a matter of fact, since the function form of w is now uniquely determined as in (3.8),

it is not necessary to know the solutions to picard-fuchs equations at all order in  and is enough

to know them only at the lowest order level. in fact, proceeding in this manner with the aid of the

weak coupling behavior of periods from (2.3) (or explicitly solving (3.4) or using itos result26), we

can see that the second term of (3.8) is suppressed and c(v) = i/(4). this indicates that

holds exactly! therefore, the scaling relation found by ito26 in the g2 gauge theory based on the

(aiuadi  adiuai) =

i
4

(3.9)

2xi=1

spectral curve (1.1) is actually an exact expression.

we can conclude that the scaling relation

holds exactly by repeating a similar discussion.

(aivadi  adivai) = 0

iv. summary

in this paper, we have proved the scaling relation of prepotential of g2 yang-mills theory by

using ordinary dierential form of picard-fuchs equations. the direct verication of the scaling

derivation of scaling relation

11

relation (when multiple moduli are included) is very complicated, but it would be needless to say

that our direct method presented here can be applied for any gauge group cases. that is, when one

wish to establish the scaling relations like (3.9) and (3.10):

1. represent the picard-fuchs equations in terms of single moduli derivatives.

2. consider the ordinary dierential equation satised by scaling relation using the above picard-

fuchs equations.

3. fix the basis of solutions to this equation.

4. compare the result with that from solutions to picard-fuchs equation.

note that a direct derivation of (1.2) by picard-fuchs equations as a system of partial dierential

equations is more involved than our presentation here.

in contrast with the classical gauge group cases, there are many problems concerning exceptional

gauge group cases and in order to get more insight into these exceptional gauge theories application

of whitham hierarchy42 is necessary. to to this is very hard because of the complicated singularity

structure of the spectral curves, but, also the problem of scaling relation in these cases should be

understood in this framework.

appendix: another scaling relation

in this appendix, we show that the picard-fuchs equation in terms of only v-derivatives and the

ordinary dierential equation for w.

the picard-fuchs equation can be represented as the fourth-order equation and takes the form

"9(37u8  126u5v + 81u2v2  81216u4 + 171072uv + 365783042)

then the dierential equation for w with  = 0 is given by

"6(68u21  1458u18v + 107406u15v2  2216889u12v3 + 21611934u9v4  121168548u6v5

the set of indicial indices for (a2) is found to be
