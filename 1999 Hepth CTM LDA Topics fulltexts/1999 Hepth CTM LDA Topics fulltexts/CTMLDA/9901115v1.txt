abstract

we obtain the closed-form absorption probabilities for minimally-coupled massless sca-

lars propagating in the background of d = 5 single-charge and d = 4 two-charge black holes.

these are the only two examples of extremal black holes with non-vanishing absorption

probabilities that can be solved in closed form for arbitrary incident frequencies. in both

cases, the absorption probability vanishes when the frequency is below a certain threshold,

and we discuss the connection between this phenomenon and the behaviour of geodesics in

these black hole backgrounds. we also obtain leading-order absorption cross-sections for

generic extremal p-branes, and show that the expression for the cross-section as a function

of frequency coincides with the leading-order dependence of the entropy on the temperature

in the corresponding near-extremal p-branes.

introduction

there has been considerable interest recently in studying absorption probabilities for elds

propagating in various black hole and p-brane backgrounds[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,

11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16]. one of the motivations is inspired by the conjectured duality of

supergravity on an ads spacetime and the conformal eld theory on the boundary of the

ads [17]. to obtain the absorption probability is however by itself a subject of interest. the

wave equation for a minimally-coupled scalar in an extremal p-brane background depends

only on the metric of the p-brane, which has the form

ds2 =

(1.1)

where d = p + 1 is the dimension of the world volume of the p-brane and d = d  d  2,
and h = 1 + q/r d are harmonic functions in the transverse space ym, with r2 = ym ym.
it follows that the wave equation m (g gm n n ) = 0 for the massless minimally-coupled
scalar, with the ansatz (t, r, i) = (r) y (i) eit, takes the following form:

(1.2)

where  =  r and  =  q1/ d
pendent of the world-volume dimension d. this implies that the wave equation is invariant

 . note that the wave equation depends on d, but is inde-

under double dimensional reduction of the corresponding p-brane. it is not, however, in-
variant under vertical dimensional reduction, where d rather than d is reduced.

in general, the wave equation (1.2) is not exactly solvable; it cannot be mapped into

any known second-order dierential equation. the leading-order absorption probability

can be obtained by matching approximate solutions of the wave equation that are valid in

overlapping inner and outer regions; this technique was pioneered in absorption probability

calculations for the schwarzschild black hole [18]. only for a few examples are the wave

equations exactly solvable, including the extremal d3-brane [13] and the extremal dyonic
string [16], corresponding to n = 1, d = 4 and n = 2, d = 2 respectively. in these two cases,

the wave equation (1.2) can be cast into the form of the modied mathieu equation [13, 16],

which has been studied in great detail in the mathematical literature [19]. however, even

in these two cases the nal results for the absorption probabilities can only be expressed in

terms of power-series expansions in some small parameter, which depends on the frequency

of the wave and, in the case of dyonic string, on the relative ratio of the electric and magnetic

charges as well.

2

in this paper, we shall consider two further examples, where the absorption probability

can in fact be obtained in closed form for scalar waves of arbitrary frequencies. one example

is the extremal single-charge black hole in d = 5, and the other is the extremal two-charge

black hole in d = 4. we discuss these two examples in sections 2 and 3 respectively. in both

cases, an interesting phenomenon occurs, namely that the absorption probability vanishes

below a certain threshold frequency for the incident scalar wave. in section 4, we observe

that this is related to special features of the behaviour of infalling geodesics in these two

black holes.

although the wave equation (1.2) cannot be solved in general, the leading-order absorp-

tion probability for low energy waves can nevertheless be obtained by matching inner and

outer solutions of the wave equations. we shall apply this technique in section 5, and obtain

the leading-order absorption for general extremal p-branes, which we nd to be given by

 = c (q1 q2  qn )

d

n d2

(1.3)

where q are the charges and c is a charge-independent numerical constant. this result

coincides with the leading-order dependence of the entropy on the temperature of the cor-

responding near-extremal p-brane, namely

s = c (q1 q2  qn )

d

(1.4)

which we obtain in section 6. such a parallel implies a connection between the entropy

of near-extremal p-branes and the low-energy absorption by the corresponding extremal

p-branes.

2 single-charge black hole in d = 5

in maximal d = 5 supergravity, each of the 27 vector potentials can support a single-charge

black hole. these black holes form a 27-dimensional representation under the weyl group

of e6 [20]. a complete classication of the eld congurations that supports n -charge

p-branes in maximal supergravities can be found in [21]. the single-charge black hole in
d = 5 corresponds to n = 1, d = 2, and hence from (1.2) the scalar wave equation is

this can be solved exactly, giving

(2.2)

where we have dened

q q2  ( + 1)2 .

(2.3)

we see from this that the behaviour of the solutions will be radically dierent depending on

whether  is larger than ( + 1) or smaller than ( + 1). in particular, it will turn out that

we only have wave-like behaviour near the horizon if  >  + 1. (it is always understood in

our discussions that  is, without loss of generality, taken to be non-negative.)

expanding (2.2) around  = 0, using (a.2), we nd that the wave-function near the

horizon takes the form



 (1 + iq)

 

eiq log(/2) +



 (1  iq)

eiq log(/2) .

(2.4)

(we have used the identity xy = ey log x here.) the boundary condition at the horizon,

which requires that the wave be purely ingoing there, implies that we must have  = 0.

expanding (2.2) at large , using (a.1), we nd that the wave-function near innity

takes the form

  



2s 2



eq/2 ei/4(cid:16)  ei + i eq ei(cid:17) .

(2.5)

thus comparing with the generic structure   (ei + s0 ei), we read o the s-matrix:

s0 = i eq .

(2.6)

from this, it follows that the absorption probability for the single-charge d = 5 extremal

black hole is given by

p = 1  |s0|2 = 1  e2q
= 1  e22(+1)2
,

   + 1 .

(2.7)

it should be emphasised that this is an exact result, correct to all orders in . it should
also be noted that if    + 1 there is no wave-like behaviour near the horizon, and the
absorption probability is therefore zero for all    + 1.

it is instructive also to compute the absorption probability in this example by taking

the ratio of the ingoing uxes at the horizon and at innity. the ux in this case is given in
general by f = i3 (      ), where here  is taken to be purely ingoing component
of the scalar wave. using the near-horizon form of the solution (2.4) (and recalling that the

boundary condition required  = 0), we see that ux into the horizon is given by

2 =

2||2


sinh q .

(2.8)

fhorizon =

2||2 q

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(1  iq)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

on the other hand the ingoing ux at innity, calculated using the asymptotic form (2.5),

is

f = ||2


eq .

hence we nd that the absorption probability is

f
when    + 1, in agreement with (2.7).

(2.9)

(2.10)

note that in the non-extremal case the wave equation is more complicated. the absorp-

tion probability for non-extremal 3-charge black holes has been calculated for low energies

in [3, 5], by the standard techniques involving the overlap between approximate solutions in

inner and outer regions. in particular, in [5] two of the three charges were taken to be small

in comparison to third, and can be taken to be zero. in this case, when the frequency of
the th mode is such that    + 1, the absorption can be seen to be zero in the extremal
limit, in agreement with our result above. on the other hand if  >  + 1, the approach in

[5] yields an absorption probability for which the extremal limit is singular, and it cannot

be compared with the exact result that we have obtained here.

3 two-charge black hole in d = 4

other examples where the wave equation is exactly solvable are for the single-charge and

two-charge extremal black holes in four dimensions. the single-charge case gives a wave

equation which is precisely equivalent to the familiar coulomb problem in quantum me-

chanics, and there is no absorption at any frequency [22]. the two-charge case, on the

other hand, is more analogous to the single-charge d = 5 black hole. in this two-charge

case, the wave equation is

i  = 0 ,

(3.1)

where we now have two parameters, i =  ri =  qi, associated with the two charges

q1 and q2. (note that although the two-charge black hole can also be obtained from the

intersection of a d1-brane and a d5-brane by dimensional reduction, it requires vertical as

well as diagonal reduction steps. thus the wave equation (3.1) in d = 4 is dierent from

the d1-d5 wave equation in d = 5, 6 or higher dimensions, which can be cast into the

form of the modied mathiew equation [16].) it is convenient to dene the following two

constants:

p  1

2 (1 + 2) ,

q q41 2  (2 + 1)2 .

(3.2)

the general solution to (3.1), which is exact, is

 =  (iq1)/2 ei u ( 1

2 +ip+ i

2 q, 1+iq, 2i)+ (iq1)/2 ei m ( 1

2 +ip+ i

2 q, 1+iq, 2i) , (3.3)

where u (a, b, z) and m (a, b, z) are kummers irregular and regular conuent hypergeometric

functions, respectively. we give some details of their asymptotic behaviour in the appendix.

it can be seen from (a.3) and (a.4) that the behaviour of the exact wave function (3.3)

near  = 0, in the vicinity of the horizon, is given by

 

i  (iq1)/2 ei

(3.4)

noting that we can write iq/2 as ei(q/2) log , we see that to satisfy the boundary condition
that the wave on the horizon be purely ingoing, the coecient of iq/2 must vanish. this

gives the following relation between  and :

( 1

2 + ip  i

2 q) (1 + iq) sinh q

.

(3.5)

by looking at the large- asymptotic expansions for the kummer conuent hypergeo-

metric functions, given by (a.5), we nd that the wave function near innity can be written

in the form

  

 ei /4 2ipiq/2 e(p/2+q/4) (eq + e2p) ip

22 sinh(q) 

(cid:16)  ei + s0 ei(cid:17) ,

(3.6)

with the s-matrix s0 given by

2 q) (2)2ip ep cosh (p  1

2 q)

( 1

2 + ip + i

2 q)(eq + e2p)

.

(3.7)

consequently, we nd that the absorption probability for the extremal two-charge black

hole in four dimensions is given by

p = 1  |s0|2 =

1  e2q
1 + e(q+2p) ,

(3.8)

when 1 2  (+ 1
2 )2, while p = 0 otherwise. (in deriving these formulae, we have used the
fact that the gamma function obeys the identity |( 1
2 +i x)|2 =  sech( x), where x is real.)
in terms of the original dimensionless parameters i =  qi, the absorption probability is

therefore given by

p =

1  e241 2(2+1)2

1 + e(1+2+41 2(2+1)2)

,

1 2  ( + 1

2 )2 ,

(3.9)

with p = 0 if 1 2  ( + 1

2 )2.

again, we may verify that the same result for the absorption probability is obtained by

calculating the ratios of the ingoing uxes at the horizon and at innity. in this case, the
ux is given by f = i 2 (      ). from the results given above we nd, after simple
algebra, that the ingoing uxes are given by

fhorizon = ||2 eq cosh (p + 1
2 q)

sinh(q)

,

f = ||2 e(p+q/2) (eq + e2p)2

4 sinh2(q)

.

(3.10)

taking the ratio fhorizon/f, we indeed nd that it agrees precisely with (3.9).

an alternative way of performing the calculation here is to redene the notion of what

constitutes an ingoing wave and what constitutes an outgoing wave. this can be done,
for example, simply by dening the time dependence to be eit rather than eit. since 

appears quadratically in the original wave equation, this means that we can simply choose

universally to interpret the direction of motion of a wave front to be the opposite of the

conventional choice. an alternative way of expressing this is that since the wave equation

such as (3.1) for an energy eigenstate is real, one can complex conjugate the solution (3.3)

and obtain another solution.

the upshot is that we can choose to reinterpret the requirement that the wave described
by (3.3) be ingoing at the horizon as the requirement that the coecient of eiq/2 in (3.4)
vanish, provided that we also dene an ingoing wave at innity to be one with ei, as
opposed to ei, dependence. if we do this, then the requirement that the wave on the

horizon be ingoing becomes the condition  = 0, so that the solution is

 =  (iq1)/2 ei m ( 1

2 + ip + i

2 q, 1 + iq, 2i) .

(3.11)

this is a simpler form for the solution than the one we discussed previously. at large ,
(3.11) is proportional to (ei + s0 ei), with

s0 =

i eq/2 (2)2i p ( 1
2  i p + i

( 1

2 + i p + i
2 q)

2 q)

.

(3.12)

it is easy to see that this gives rise to the same result (3.8) for the absorption probability.

in [22], it was observed that the solution (3.11) could be expressed at large  in the form

1


 

sin(cid:16) + p log(2)  1

2 l  + l(cid:17) ,

where l =  1
from (3.12) that l is a complex quantity, which we nd to be

2 q (we have adjusted the notation of [22] to t in with ours). it follows

e2i l =

(3.14)

(note that unlike the standard situation for coulomb scattering, or single-charge black holes

in d = 4, where l is a real quantity given by the phase of the relevant gamma function,
here l is not equal to the real quantity arg ( 1
q term.) if the frequency in the th mode is such that 1 2  ( + 1
l are real and there is no absorption, while if 1 2 > ( + 1

2 )2 they are both complex, and

2  i p + i

the absorption is given by (3.8), with p and q given by (3.2).

4 geodesics and absorption probability

in the previous sections, we have obtained exact absorption probabilities in closed form for

the extremal d = 5 single-charge and d = 4 two-charge black holes. the results are valid

for massless scalar waves of arbitrary frequency. these two examples are of interest since

such exact solutions for absorption probabilities are rare in gravity theories. in both cases,

the results exhibit an interesting phenomenon, namely that the absorption probability is

zero in a given mode if the frequency of the scalar wave is below some threshold value,

related to the angular momentum  of the mode. a related, but more extreme, situation

also occurs in the d = 4 single-charge black hole, where the absorption probability vanishes

for all values of the frequency of the scalar wave.

the vanishing of the absorption probabilities below certain threshold frequencies in the

two cases studied in this paper is related to the behaviour of geodesics in these black holes.

to see this, let us rst consider radially-infalling timelike geodesics in the metric of an

extremal n -charge p-brane in d dimensions. these are described by the lagrangian

dx
d

l = 1

2 g

dx
d

(cid:16) dr
d(cid:17)2
where d = p + 1 and d = d  d  1. the lagrangian takes the value l =  1
2 for a timelike
geodesic and so this, together with the equation of motion for t, immediately gives us two

where e is a constant of integration. thus near the horizon at r = 0, we have that h  r d,

and hence

(4.3)

thus we see that the coordinate time t taken for the geodesic to reach the horizon is either

nite, logarithmically-divergent, or power-law divergent as a function of r, according to the

following inequality:

1

1

2 n d < 1 :
2 n d = 1 :
2 n d > 1 :

finite coordinate time

logarithmically-divergent coordinate time

(4.4)

power-law-divergent coordinate time

it is straightforward to verify that the same conclusions hold for null geodesics. (note that
in the case of black holes we have d = d  3, but that the conditions (4.4) apply equally
to any extremal n -charge p-branes.) thus we see that amongst the single-charge black

holes, the case d = 4 is distinguished by the fact that timelike or null geodesics reach the

horizon in a nite coordinate time. (see, for example, [23].) in d = 5, the time taken is
logarithmically divergent, whilst in d  6 it is power-law divergent. the 2-charge black
hole in d = 4 again has a logarithmically-divergent coordinate time, while for all n  3
charge black holes in d  4, and all n  2 charge black holes in d  5, it again takes a
power-law-divergent coordinate time to reach the horizon.

we therefore see the following correspondences. if a timelike or null geodesic reaches the

horizon in nite coordinate time, there is no absorption at all. if it takes a logarithmically-

divergent coordinate time, there is absorption provided that the frequency of the ingoing

wave exceeds some nite bound,  > 0; this is the situation for the d = 5 single-charge,

and d = 4 two-charge black holes that we have considered in this paper. finally, if a

timelike geodesic reaches the horizon in a power-law-divergent coordinate time, there is

non-vanishing absorption for all frequencies  > 0.

the correspondence between the behaviour of infalling geodesics and the absorption

probability may not be too surprising, in view of the fact that the radial coordinate-

dependence of the scalar wave function near the horizon of a p-brane is closely related

to the dependence of the radial coordinate of an infalling geodesic on the coordinate time t.

for example, the coordinate time t depends logarithmically on the radial coordinate r of an

infalling geodesic in the d = 5 single-charge and d = 4 two-charge black holes. a similar
dependence, namely   eik log , appears in the near-horizon form of the solutions (2.4, 3.4)
of the wave equation in the corresponding black-hole backgrounds. more generally, for any

extremal p-brane the wave equation is given by (1.2), and the solution near the horizon
at  = 0 is given by (5.11). the near-horizon solution is therefore wavelike if   0, but
instead has just a power-law dependence on  if  < 0. the sign of , which is given by

9

(5.8), is thus precisely correlated with the cases enumerated in (4.4).

5 leading order absorption by extremal p-branes

in general the wave equation (1.2) cannot be solved analytically. one approach is to solve

the equation in two distinct but overlapping regions, namely an inner region near to the

p-brane, and an outer region reaching to innity. such a technique has been widely used

recently in obtaining low energy absorption sections for various black holes and p-branes

[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 6, 7, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15].

for the outer solution, it is convenient to dene  = ( d+1)/2 , leading to the wave

equation

 +h 1  (2 + d)2

42

for notational convenience, we dene

+

ny=1(cid:16)1 +

 d


 d(cid:17)i = 0 .

 = (

ny=1

)1/n .

(this means that if all the charges are equal we have  = .) in the region where

 >> n d/(n d2) ,

the equation (5.1) can be approximated as

 +h 1  (2 + d)2

42

+ 1i = 0 ,

which can be solved in terms of bessel functions. thus the outer solution is given by

(5.1)

(5.2)

(5.3)

(5.4)

(5.5)

outer =  d/2(cid:16) j+ d/2() +  y+ d/2()(cid:17) .

note that the constraint (5.3) is derived with the assumption that d > 2. otherwise the
constraint would be  >> . thus the cases with d = 2 and 1 are exceptional; these were

discussed in the previous sections.

in the inner region, the constant 1 in the harmonic function can be dropped, provided

that 1

 <<  .

it is convenient to use a new variable z, and to dene a new wavefunction, as follows:

z =

n d/2
u u

,

 = z

1
2 (v1) f (z) ,

1in the case of n = 1, the valid region can actually be  << 1.

10

(5.6)

(5.7)

where

u = (n d  2)/2 ,

v = 2 d/(n d  2) .

the equation (1.2) then becomes

f  +h 1  (2l + v)2

42

+

ny=1(cid:16)1 +(cid:16) 

(cid:17) d (/u)v

zv

(cid:17)i f = 0 .

(5.8)

(5.9)

where l = 2/(n d 2). specically, when n = 1 we have v > 2, and hence the limit where
the approximation to (5.9) is a good one is when z >> n v/(n v2), which implies  << 1.

if, on the other hand we have n > 1, then v < 2, and hence the approximation is good

when z >> , implying (5.6). if we make this approximation then equation (5.9) becomes

f  +h 1  (2l + v)2

4z2

+ 1i f = 0 .

which is solvable in terms of bessel functions, giving

inner = zv/2 (c1 jl+v/2(z) + c2 yl+v/2(z))

=

vn d/4

uv/2  d/2hc1 jl+v/2(

n d/2
u u ) + c2 yl+v/2(

n d/2

u u )i .

(5.10)

(5.11)

in order for the solution to describe a purely ingoing wave near the horizon at  = 0, we

see from (a.1) that we must have c2 = i c1. the ingoing wave on the horizon is then given

by   i c2p2/ z(v1)/2 ei z ei (2l+v+1)/4.

the inner and outer solutions are valid in the regions specied in (5.6) and (5.3), and

thus it follows that in order to have an overlap where there is a range of common validity

for the two solutions, the frequency  must be suciently small that

n v


= 1/u << 1

(5.12)

if n > 1, while instead n v << 1 if n = 1. this implies that the approximations are valid

in an appropriately low-energy regime. in such a regime, both the coordinates z and ,

appearing respectively in the bessel functions in the inner and outer regions, are much less

than 1, and so we can perform small-argument series expansions on the bessel functions in

both regions, and hence we can match the two solutions in the leading orders. in the inner

region the boundary condition on the horizon has already determined that the integration

constants c1 and c2 are of equal modulus, since c2 = i c1, but in the outer region the relative

sizes of the integration constants  and  are yet to be determined. however, since the

structure in the inner region is established, it is a simple matter to recognise the most

dominant terms in the small-z power-series expansion of inner, and then to require that

11

these match with the small- power-series expansion of outer. note that we need to match

both the functions and their derivatives in the overlap region, implying that the functional

forms of the inner and outer solutions at leading order must be identical. structurally, these

have the following forms:

inner :

outer :

  ( + +2) +   d .

(5.13)

it is straightforward to see that zl, (or equivalently ), is the leading order of the ex-
pansion, since z << 1 in the overlapping region. for generic value of l = 2/(n d  2), the
subleading order term is zl+2. it follows that in general we can only match the leading

order term, providing a determination of , but not . however, in some special cases,
namely v + l < 2  l, i.e.

< 1 ,

in these cases, we can match the inner and outer

the subleading order term is zv+l.

solutions at the level both of the leading constant order and also the rst sub-leading order
 d. equating the coecients of  and  d in the overlap region thus enables us to

obtain leading-order expressions for both the integration constants  and  in the outer
solution. note that for  = 0, the condition (5.14) is satised provided that n  2.

there are two methods available for calculating the absorption probability. the rst is

by calculating the ratio of the ingoing ux at the horizon, divided by the ingoing ux at

innity. this method does not require the knowledge of the constant . the second is by

calculating the s-matrix, which is governed by the ratio of  to . this second method

can be used only if , in addition to , is known. for now, we shall therefore employ the

ux-ratio method.

as we saw above, to determine  we need only to keep the leading order in a power-series

expansion. we nd from (5.11) and (a.2) that this is given by

inner = 

c2


2l+v/2

ul

n dl/2

(l + v/2)  +  .

(5.15)

on the other hand for the outer solution, we nd from (5.5) that in the small-argument

expansion appropriate to the overlap region the leading-order term is given by

outer

 +  .

d)

(5.16)

12

(the  coecient in the outer solution is negligible, at this leading order, in comparison

to .) equating the expressions in (5.15) and (5.16), we obtain the relation between the

coecients  and c2 of the outer and inner solutions. the absorption coecient is most

easily calculated at this leading order as the ratio of the ingoing ux at the horizon, divided

by the ingoing ux at innity. in general, this ux may be dened as

f = i 

d+1(cid:16) 


  

 

(cid:17) ,

(5.17)

where  here is taken to be the ingoing component of the wave. from the asymptotic forms

of inner and outer where the arguments of the bessel functions are large, we nd from

(5.11), (5.5) and (a.1) that the ingoing uxes at the horizon and at innity are given by

fhorizon =

4

 |c2|2 u1v n d v/2 ,

f = ||2


,

(5.18)

and hence to leading order the absorption probability p  fhorizon/f is

p =

22 (2u)1v2l n d(l+v/2)
d)2 (l + 1

22+ d ( + 1 + 1
2

2 v)2

.

(5.19)

finally, we note that the phase-space factor relating the absorption probability to the

scattering cross-section  is [24]

 = 2

d 

d/2 ( 1
2

d) ( + 1 + 1

d)  + d  1



! 2 d1 p .

hence we arrive at the result for the scattering cross-section

 =

22+ d/2 (2u)1v2l ( d/2) n d(l+
d) (l + 1

22 ( + 1 + 1

2 v)2

  + d  1
! .



(5.20)

(5.21)

the above result is the leading-order contribution to the low-energy absorption. in this

case the  = 0 s-wave absorption is dominant, and is given by

0 =

22+ d/2 (2u)1v ( 1
2

d) (q1q2  qn)v/2v1

(1 + d) ( 1

2 v)2

.

(5.22)

thus at low energy the absorption cross-section  of a generic extremal p-brane, and the

frequency of the incoming wave, are related by

 = c (q1 q2  qn )

d

n d2 

2 d

n d2

1

,

(5.23)

where c is some purely numerical constant. it should be recalled that the above result is
applicable only when n d2 > 0. if instead n d2  0, which arises for d = 5 single-charge

13

and d = 4 single or two-charge black holes, the absorption probabilities vanish at the low

energies, below certain thresholds. the closed-form results in these cases were obtained in

sections 2 and 3. note that when the condition (5.14) is satised, (for example,  = 0 and
n  2) both  and  in (5.5) can be determined by matching the inner and outer solutions
in the overlap region. in this case, the absorption can also be calculated by the s-matrix

method.

in the next section we shall show that the leading-order relationship (6.8) between

the cross-section and the frequency coincides with the leading-order relation between the

entropy and the temperature of the corresponding near-extremal p-brane.

finally, in this section, we note that the original wave equation (5.1), and the trans-

formed wave equation (5.9), are identical in form if we make the replacements

d  v

  l ,

 


u

(




d/v .
)

(5.24)

in cases where v is an integer, and furthermore is equal to d, then ( d, d) form a dual pair,
associated with (d  1)-branes and ( d  1)-branes in d = d + d + 2 dimensions. when
such a dual pair arises, the dilaton becomes constant near the horizon of the p-brane. in

cases such as the d3-brane, the dyonic string or the d = 4 four-charge black hole, we have
d = d and l = , and in these cases it follows that there is an exact duality symmetry

of the wave equation in the inner region and the outer region, for arbitrary partial waves.

on the other hand for m2-brane and m5-brane, the duality that maps between the inner

and outer solutions is exact only for the s-wave, as was observed in [10]. for example, the

outer solution in the m2-brane with partial wave-number  is mapped to the inner solution

in the m5-brane with partial wave-number /2. the case for the three-charge d = 5

black-hole/string duality is analogous. the outer solution in the black hole background

with partial wave-number  is mapped to the inner solution in the string background with

partial wave-number /2. this occurrence of half-integers may be indicative of an intrinsic

role for fermions in this discussion of duality.

(6.1)

(6.2)

the extremal limit is obtained by sending k  0 and   , while keeping the q

the outer horizon of the metric (6.1) is located at r+ = k1/ d. it straightforward to show

that the hawking temperature and entropy are given by

es t = k .

where v is dened in (5.8). hence we obtain an implicit relationship between entropy and

temperature, given by

2 (es t ) +q 1

4 (es t )2 + q2

(cid:17)v/2

(6.7)

where we have dened c = ( 4

in the near-extremal regime, where es t = k << q, we can therefore obtain the

leading-order expansion of entropy in terms of temperature, given by

es0 = c (q1 q2  qn )

d

(6.8)

thus the leading-order relationship between the entropy and temperature of a near-extremal

p-brane coincides precisely with the leading-order relationship (5.23) between the scattering

15

cross-section and the frequency for scalar s-waves in the corresponding extremal p-brane.
(such a correspondence between s(t ) and () breaks down when n d  2  2, which is
associated with nite or logarithmically-divergent coordinate time for geodesics to reach the

horizon. in these cases, the temperature increases as the p-brane approaches extremality.
when n d = 2, the temperature reaches a nite maximum at the extremal limit, whilst
for n d < 2, the temperature goes to innity at the extremal limit. such black holes were

discussed in [27], and they can be viewed as elementary particles.)

it is of interest to look at the higher-order terms in the expansion for the entropy as

expansion can easily be obtained from the implicit expression for s in terms of t given

a function of temperature. note that the expansion parameter is k = (es0 t )  t v. the
in (6.7), by means of the following iterative algorithm. if we dene esi to be the entropy
accurate up to order t (i+1)v1, then by substuting esi into the right-hand side of equation
(6.7), we obtain a new expression esi+1 that is accurate up to order t (i+2)v1:

esi+1 = c t v1

ny=1(cid:16) 1

2 (esi t ) +q 1

4 (esi t )2 + q2

(cid:17)v/2

with the leading order es0 given by (6.8), we can then obtain the relation between the

entropy and the temperature to arbitrary order, as a power series in t v. we nd that the

rst few orders are

(6.10)

(6.11)

note that the rst two sub-leading terms depend on the charges only through the function 1,

but that a new structure 3, with dierent functional dependence on the charges, emerges at

the third order in the expansion. similarly, yet another function of the charges, 5, emerges
at the fth order, and so on. in general, the expansion (6.10) up to order t m v will involve
the q independent functions {1, 3, 5, . . . , 2q1}, where q = [(m + 1)/2] is the integer part
of (m + 1)/2.

having shown that the leading-order relationship between entropy and temperature for

near-extremal p-branes coincides with the leading order in the relationship between the scat-

tering cross-section and the frequency for low-frequency scalar s-waves in the corresponding

extremal p-branes, it is of interest to investigate how far this parallel extends at higer orders

16

in the expansion. there are only a limited number of cases where higher-order corrections

to the scattering cross-sections have been reliably obtained. one of these is the d3-brane,

for which the rst few orders are [13]


0

= 1  1

6 q 4 log(e q1/4 ) + 7

72 q 4 + 

(6.12)

where  is the eulers constant. on the other hand, the relation between the entropy and

temperature for the near-extremal d3-brane can be seen from (6.10) to be given by

s
s0

= 1 + 44 q t 4 +  .

(6.13)

another example is the dyonic string in d = 6, for which the rst few terms in the expansion

for the s-wave scattering cross-section are [16]


0

= 1  2(qe + qm) 2 log(e ) + (qe + qm) 2 +  .

(6.14)

here we have dened 2 = qe qm 2/4. by contrast, the relation between the entropy
and temperature, which can be read o from (6.10), is

s
s0

= 1 + 82 (qe + qm) t 2 +  .

(6.15)

thus we see that in these two examples there are additional terms, depending upon the

logarithm of the frequency, in the relation between the scattering cross-section and the

frequency.

a further example is the 3-charge black hole in d = 5. the low energy absorption cross

section of the extremal black hole was obtained in [3], in the case where the charge q3 is

much smaller than the other two charges q1 and q2. it is given by


0

= 1 + 1

4 (cid:16) q1 q2

q3 (cid:17)1/2

 + 1

48 2 q1 q2
q3

2 + o(4) .

(6.16)

the corresponding expression for the entropy in terms of the temperature can be read o

from (6.10). for the case where q3 << q1, q2, we nd that it is given by

s
s0

= 1 + (cid:16) q1 q2

q3 (cid:17)1/2

t + 3

2 2 q1 q2
q3

t 2 + 23(cid:16) q1 q2

q3 (cid:17)3/2

t 3 + o(t 4) .

(6.17)

thus we see that the expansion parameters are exactly the same, although the precise

numerical coecients disagree.
