we suggest a closed form expression for the path integral of quantum transition amplitudes. we
introduce a quantum action with renormalized parameters. we present numerical evidence in the
case of the v  x4 potential. the closed path integral is relevant for quantum chaos and quantum
instantons.

1. introduction
the path integral has become a standard method to
quantize classical theories. the path integral in imag-
inary time has also become an established method in nu-
merical computation of quantum mechnical observables
(e.g. in lattice eld theory). on the other hand, the class
of systems for which the path integral can be computed
analytically is a ridiculously small. prominent examples
are quadratic lagrangians, e.g., for free motion and the
harmonic oscillator [1]. moreover, the path integral is
known, e.g., for the the coulomb system [2]. let us con-
sider the q.m. transition amplitude from xin, tin to xf i,
tf i given by

< xf i, tf i|xin, tin > g(xf i, tf i; xin, tin) =

denotes the classical action. in some cases this path inte-
gral can be expressed as a sum over classical paths only

where the exponent of the last term is the classical action
evaluated along the classical trajectory from xin, tin to
xf i, tf i. the factor z represents some (time-dependent
but position-independent) normalisation factor, enforced
by the unitarity of the amplitude. eq.(3) holds, e.g., for
quadratic lagrangians. in the case of the harmonic os-
cillator v (x) = m

another example where the sum over classical paths is
exact is the path integral of the quantum mechanical top,
which mathematically corresponds to free motion on the
group manifold of su (2) [3]. eq.(3) is a well known but
remarkable result. one may ask if there are other sys-
tems, where the path integral is given by a sum over
classical paths. the answer is: this is possible. how-
ever, the result is certainly not true in general. a simple
counter example is given by nelson [4].

in the following we will explore if the validity of eq.(3)
can be extended to a wider class of quantum systems, if
we allow the classical action to be replaced by a more gen-
eral quantum action. the motivation comes from pertur-
bative renormalisation in q.f.t. recall that a theory is
called renormalizable, if a xed nite number of counter
terms of the action allows to make the q.f.t. nite to
any given order (although the value of the counter terms
may change with the order). the renormalized action is
dierent from the bare action, due to quantum loop cor-
rections, which exist for interacting theories. but apart
from the dierence in the parameters (bare vs. renor-
malized) the action and also greens functions have the
same structure in its bare and renormalized form. quan-
tum mechanics can be viewed as q.f.t. in one dimen-
sion.
in analogy to q.f.t. we suggest here that there
is a quantum action which describes the transition am-
plitude (greens function) and has the same structure as
the classical action but with dierent parameters.
this leads us to formulate in q.m. the following

conjecture: for a given classical action s with a local
interaction v (x) there is a quantum action

(5)

correspondingly, eq.(6) becomes

s = z dt

m

which allows to express the transition amplitude by

xf i,tf i

xin,tin(cid:21) .

s[xclass](cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

g(xf i, tf i; xin, tin) = z exp(cid:20) i
the action s is in general dierent from the classical ac-
tion. here xclass denotes the classical path corresponding
to the action s and z denotes the normalisation factor
corresponding to s. it is crucial to emphasize that like
eq.(3), eq.(6) is supposed to be valid with the same ac-
tion s for all sets of boundary conditions xf i, tf i, xin, tin.
any dependence on xf i, xin enters only via the trajectory
xclass. z depends on tf i, tin, the action parameters and
h, but not on xf i, xin.

why is such a result of physical interest? (i) suppose
one would have explicitly constructed the action s. then
one has found a closed form for the path integral. (ii)
the action s denes a renormalized action in q.m. one
can obtain from s the renormalized mass and renormal-
ized interaction, i.e., potential parameters. (iii) eq.(6) is
a simple relation between the transition amplitude and
an action s which mathematically has the form of the
classical action. workers in quantum chaos have used
gutzwillers trace formula [5] which gives a relation be-
tween the transition amplitude and classical orbits, in
order to understand quantum chaos in a semi-classical
regime (e.g. highly excited states in atoms). eq.(6) is
much simpler than gutzwillers trace formula. but most
importantly, is allows to dene quantum chaos in an un-
ambigous way. (iv) eq.(6) allows to study quantum de-
scendents of classical instanton solutions. (v) eq.(6) ap-
plied to youngs double slit experiment opens a new vista
to the interpretation of quantum mechanics.

we have no proof of this conjecture. however, we will
give here numerical evidence in support of the conjecture.
finally, we will elaborate on the topics (i,ii), while (iii-v)
will be discussed in another letter.

2. construction of quantum action
it is our purpose to determine the quantum action eq.(6)
numerically. this requires to calculate the transition am-
plitude, eq.(1). we have chosen to calculate that path
integral via monte carlo with importance sampling. this
requires to go over to imaginary time (euclidean path in-
tegral) t  it. then eq.(1) becomes

ge(xf i, tf i; xin, tin) = ze exp(cid:20) 1

the transition to imaginary time causes a sign change of
the mass term, besides that the action parameters keep
its absolute and relative values. in the sequel of the paper
we will work in imaginary time. for sake of simplicity of
notation we drop the subscript e in what follows.

we compute the euclidean greens function by split-
ting the euclidean action into a free part and a poten-
tial part. because the euclidean free path integral is
known analytically, one can write the euclidean greens
function as a ratio of the the full path integral and the
free path integral and consider the free term as a weight
function and the potential term as an observable. this
allows to apply standard monte carlo with importance
sampling (e.g. metropolis algorithm).

below) given in polynomial form v (x) = pn
action v (x) = pn

let us specify the class of potentials. we consider a
particle of mass m moving in the presence of a local po-
tential v (x). let v (x) be non-negative (bounded from
n=0 vnxn.
the classical action is parametrized by m, v0, . . . , vn .
we write the potential of the corresponding quantum
n=0 vnxn. the quantum action is
parametrized by m, v0, . . . , vn . eq.(9) should hold for all
boundaries xin, xf i and all time intervalls t = tf i  tin.
we choose a value for the time t and a set {x1, . . . , xj }
and compute the euclidean transition amplitude for all
pairs of xin, xf i taken from that set. let us denote the
corresponding euclidean transition amplitude by

gij  g(xi, xj, t ).

(11)

we also denote the euclidean action s along its classical
path xclass by

ij = s[xclass|xi,t
xj ,0 .

(12)

the euclidean normalisation function z does not depend
on xin, xf i. thus we subsume z into 

sub

ij = ij + ln z.

then eq.(9) takes the form

while the quantum action has n +2 parameters, eq.(14)
represents j 2/2 + o(j) independent equations to deter-
mine the quantum action. we have chosen a larger num-
ber of equations than parameters (over-determined) re-
quiring that the error in eq.(14) becomes globally mini-
mal. i.e., we make a 2-t,

which is a function of the parameters of the quantum
action, 2( m, v0, . . . , vn ). a solution for the quantum
action is considered as consistent, if we nd the same
action parameters for dierent sets of boundary points
{x1, . . . , xj } and dierent values of time t .

3. numerical results
for the computation of euclidean transition amplitudes
via monte carlo with importance sampling we have used
the metropolis algorithm. the computation of the action
ij for a given pair of boundary points xin, xf i requires
to compute the classical path, i.e., to solve the euler-
lagrange equations of motion in imaginary time for such

boundary values. we have converted the boundary value
problem into an initial value problem, using the shoot-
ing method and the bi-section method to search for the
initial velocity. we have applied the runge-kutta and
newton-raphson algorithm. for the search of the global
minimum in the space of parameters m and vk, we have
performed a 2-t, also we used the conjugate gradient
method as well as the simplex algorithm.

(a) first we considered the harmonic oscillator v (x) =
v2x2, v2 = 1/2 (with parameters m =  = h = 1). the
classical path, the transition amplitude and the renor-
malized action are analytically known, s = s. the har-
monic oscillator serves to test the algorithms, the esti-
mation of statistical errors of the matrix elements gij
and the propagation of errors into the action param-
eters. note that the coecient v0 is related to z by
z = exp(v0t ). the boundary points {x1, . . . , xj } are
equidistantly spaced over each interval [b, +b]. the re-
sults are presented in tab.[1]. the row fit corresponds
to a t using the exact matrix elements. the row fit mc
gives the 2-t obtained from matrix elements computed
by monte carlo. for the value of the renormalized mass
there is agreement (within statistical errors) for the dif-
ferent intervals and with the classical value. the same
holds for the linear and quadratic term of the renormal-
ized potential. the constant term of the renormalized
potential agrees with the classical value for the interval
[1, +1], but on average it is three standard deviations
o the classsical value. the results are consistent with
s = s.

(b) next we have considered the quartic interaction
v (x) = v4x4, v4 = 1 (with parameters m = h = 1). we
have chosen the time interval t = 0.5. the numerical
results are shown in tab.[2]. the following observations
are made: (i) the value of the renormalized mass is be-

low, but near to the classical value. they dier, however,
by several standard deviations. (ii) the linear and the
cubic renormalized potential term are compatible within
statistical error with the value zero. the vanishing of
those terms is expected from parity conservation of the

3

quantum system. (iii) the renormalized action generates
a quadratic potential term, absent in the classical action.
(iv) the quartic term of the renormalized action is com-
patible within statistical errors with the corresponding
classical term. with respect to variation of the inter-
val, most coecients vary very little and are compatible
within statistical errors with each other. the quadratic
term is more sensitive, showing uctuations from its av-
erage value of up to two standard deviations. in general
we nd for j = 6 that the numerical values of 2 lie
below the value 2 = 36, which means that the ts are
quite acceptable. we found that the intervals, where
the algorithms work, lie in the range of [0.8, +0.8] to
[3.5, +3.5]. if the interval is too small, with boundary
points xi << 1, then the potential terms x2 and x4 are
dicult to distinguish. on the other hand, if the inter-
val is too large, with boundary points xi >> 1, then
the observable exp[x4] (of the monte carlo algorithm)
becomes very small. also in the renormalized action the
quartic term dominates strongly over the quadratic term,
which makes the latter dicult to discriminate. in our
opinion, the numerical precision is limited by the errors
of the matrix elements computed via monte carlo. we
have done runs with ntherm = 4000, nskip = 2000 and
nconf = 1000. the computations were done on a sun
sparc 10, which took about one day for each interval.

4. interpretation
how can we interpret our results and what are its impli-
cations? (i) writing eq.(6) as a path integral reads

simple picture is that of a travelling bee hive. suppose a
bee population travels in a hive located on a car on the
railroad from one town to another. first consider the
hive to be closed. then the bees travel the trajectory
of the rails, which corresponds to a classical trajectory.
next consider the hive to be open in between departure
and arrivel, but the rail passes through a dessert. the
bees leave the hive and swirl around. this corresponds
to quantum mechanics. but because there is nothing in-
teresting the bees stay around the hive and on average
follow the rail track. this corresponds to the situation,
where the classical trajectory and the trajectory of the
quantum action are the same, i.e., the classical and the
quantum action are the same (like for a free lagrangian).
finally, consider that the rail passes through a meadow
with attractive owers. suppose the bees can sense the
owers only from short distance. the owers correspond
to an attractive potential. if the bees come close to the
owers their average trajectory will be modied. the
paths of the classical action and that of the quantum ac-
tion are dierent, hence the classical and the quantum
action are dierent.
