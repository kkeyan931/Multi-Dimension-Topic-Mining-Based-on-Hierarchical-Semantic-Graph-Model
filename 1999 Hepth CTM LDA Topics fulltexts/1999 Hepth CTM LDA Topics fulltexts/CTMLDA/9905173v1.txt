abstract

d-instanton eects are studied for the iib orientifold t 2/(1)fli of sen using
type i/heterotic duality. an exact one loop threshold calculation of t8trf 4 and t8(trf 2)2
terms for the heterotic string on t 2 with wilson lines breaking so(32) to so(8)4 is

related to d-instanton induced terms in the worldvolume of d7 branes in the orientifold.

introducing d3 branes and using the ads/cft correspondence in this case, these terms

are used to calculate yang-mills instanton contributions to four point functions of the large

nc limit of n = 2 u sp(2nc) sym with four fundamental and one antisymmetric tensor
hypermultiplets.

1. introduction

one of the simplest examples of f-theory on k3 was introduced by sen [1]. this
compactication is realized as a perturbative iib orientifold t 2/(1)fli, where  is the
worldsheet orientation reversal, and i is the inversion z  z on the torus. orientifold
seven planes are located at the four xed point of the inversion i on t 2.
in addition

four d7 branes are on top of the each of the orientifold seven planes. the sources for the

dilaton and the ramond-ramond scalar coming from the d7 branes and the orientifold

seven planes cancel locally and hence the dilaton is constant over the base t 2/i. the d7

branes lead to an enhanced gauge symmetry so(8)4. each so(8) factor can be associated

with four d7 branes on top of one of the four orientifold planes.

when a probe of nc parallel d3 branes [2] is moving in the vicinity of one of the

orientifold planes the low energy eld theory on the probe is given by a n = 2, u sp(2nc)

gauge theory with four hypermultiplets transforming in the fundamental representation

and one hypermultiplet transforming in the second rank antisymmetric tensor representa-

tion of u sp(2nc) respectively.

such a theory has an exactly vanishing beta function and denes a conformal eld

theory for any nc when the expectation values for the scalars in the hypermultiplets

are zero. in [3][4] the large nc limit of the probe eld theory was considered using the

ads/cft correspondence of maldacena [5]. the conformal eld theory is related to iib
superstring theory compactied on an orientifold ads5  s5/z2.

sens iib orientifold is related by t-duality to type i theory compactied on t 2 with

wilson lines turned on. this theory is in turn mapped by s-duality to the heterotic string

theory on t 2 with wilson lines breaking so(32) to so(8)4. in the following this chain of

dualities is used to relate a one loop calculation of four derivative threshold correction on

the heterotic side to d-instanton induced four derivative terms localized in the worldvolume

of the seven branes.

in the maldacena limit the seven branes wrap a s3 in s5/z2 and ll ads5. therefore

terms in the worldvolume action of the seven brane induce vertices in the ads5 which

contribute to correlation function in the cft using the prescription introduced in [6].

2. two torus compactication with wilson lines

we are interested in the so(32) heterotic string compactied on a two torus. the
kahler and complex structure modulus of t 2 are denoted t and u respectively. the
so(32) gauge symmetry will be broken to so(8)4 by introducing wilson lines on the two

torus of the following form

i = (04, 04, 1

y 2
i = (04, 1

).

(1)

this choice of wilson lines on the heterotic side is dual to the iib orientifold t 2/(1)fli.
each so(8) factor can be associated with four d7 branes on top of one of the four orien-
tifold planes located at the xed points of t 2/i.

the one loop heterotic thresholds discussed [7][8] are related by supersymmetry to

anomaly canceling terms [9] and are presumably exact at one loop. the one loop integrands

involved are almost holomorphic since only bps-states propagate in the loop and are

related to the elliptic genus [9].

in the appendices a and b one loop thresholds of the form t8tr(f 4)1 and t8(tr(f 2)1)2
in the presence of the wilson line (1) are calculated. the subscript 1 on the eld strength
indicates that the trace is taken over the rst so(8) factor and without loss of generality

can be associated with the four d7 branes at one of the orientifold planes. such calcu-

lations were rst performed by lerche and stieberger in [10] using methods developed in

[11]. for completeness the details of this calculations are presented in the appendix us-

ing a somewhat dierent method (also employed in [12]). other one loop calculations of

thresholds in related contexts can be found in [13][14][15].

for simplicity a square torus with radii r1, r2 will be considered here. the kahler

and complex structure moduli are then given by

t = bns

12 + ir1r2, u = i

r2
r1

.

(2)

under heterotic-type i duality the coupling constants, metric and ast eld are related by

het = 1/i , i ghet

 = gi

, bhet

 = bi

 .

(3)

two t-dualities invert the radii ri  1/ri, i = 1, 2. under this operation type i gets
mapped to the type iib orientifold of sen [1], where the radii and other elds are related

by

ri

1 = 1/r1, ri

2 = 1/r2, ri

1ri

2 = i , brr,i

12 = .

(4)

2

here the superscript i denotes type i elds and no superscripts denotes elds of the iib

orientifold.  denotes the rr scalar. hence the heterotic moduli t and u get mapped to

the following elds in the iib orientifold

t   =  + i

1


, u  u = i

r1
r2

.

(5)

it follows from (5) that the heterotic modulus t can be interpreted as the d-instanton

action on the orientifold side. hence worldsheet instantons on the heterotic side (i.e.
fundamental string worldsheets wrapping t 2) which are weighted by a factor exp(2t2)
will be identied on the orientifold side with d-instantons which are weighted by a factor
exp(2/) .

as explained in the appendix b the evaluation of the heterotic one loop integrals uses

the method of orbits. it turns out that the u and t dependence of the result is decoupled

and the u dependent terms come from the trivial and degenerate orbits, whereas the t
dependent terms are given by the non degenerate orbits.2 since we are interested in d-

instanton induced terms on the worldvolume of the seven branes only the contributions of

the non degenerate orbits are considered here. the results from the appendix b are (see

eq. b.8 and b.16):

i7 =z d8x t8tr(f 4)xn (cid:16) 1
2 xn|m

using (5) together with the fact that since it is a one loop amplitude, (6) is independent
of the heterotic string coupling (which in turn is related to the volume of t 2/i). it is then

easy to see that (6) corresponds to d-instanton induced terms localized on the worldvolume

of the seven branes. in (6) only the parity even contribution was calculated, the parity

odd contribution which contains an eight dimensional epsilon tensor 8 instead of t8 can
be calculated in the same way and the only dierence is a minus sign instead of a plus

sign between the holomorphic (instanton) and and antiholomorphic (anti-instanton) part

in (6).

2 the parameter u is related to the conformal cross-ratio of the position of the seven branes

in t 2/i

3

note that only even number of instantons contribute to the four derivative terms in

(6). the structure of these terms is simpler than the one found in related instanton induced
threshold terms like t8t8r4 terms in iib [16]. the t8tr(f )4 and the t8(tr(f )2)2 thresholds
in (6) do not receive any corrections as a power series t2, which on the iib orientifold side
are interpreted as perturbative corrections to the d-instanton (as in [16]). one possible

interpretation is that there is an exact cancellation of bosonic and fermionic uctuations

in this case [17][18] in analogy to cancellations of bosonic and fermionic determinants in

the background of supersymmetric yang-mills instantons [19].

3. instanton induced interactions

a d-instanton is a d p = 1 brane, which means that the worldvolume is a point
in space time and the bosonic coordinates of open strings ending on the d-instanton x 
satisfy dirichlet boundary conditions for all directions  = 0,    , 9. the presence of an
orientifold plane changes the representation of chan-paton factors labeling open strings

stretched between several d-instantons. the worldvolume of the orientifold seven plane
will be chosen to lie in the  = 0,    7 directions. the chan-paton factors for k d-instanton
fall in representations of so(k). the vertex operator for the massless bosonic states is

given by

v i = m(ij)nx i,
v a = m[ij]nx a,

i = 0,    , 7
a = 8, 9.

(7)

the fact that the longitudinal vertex v i and transverse vertex v a transform as second

rank symmetric and antisymmetric tensors of so(k) respectively is determined by the
consistency of action of the orientifold (1)f
l i on the open string vertices and the chan-
paton factors [20].

in addition there are fermionic collective coordinates which like their bosonic partners

in (7) come in two representations.

h5 determines the parity under

in (8).

the presence of d7 branes introduces further collective coordinates, corresponding

to stretched strings between the d7 brane and the d-instanton. the analysis of such open

string states is quite subtle, since there are eight nd directions, like in the d0-d8 system

[21][22]. an analysis of the normal ordering constants for the virasoro constraint of this

system shows that all states in the ns sector are massive and that there is a single physical

state in the ramond sector (after gso projection) which can be interpreted as a fermionic

stretched string.

the vertex operator for this state when inserted on the boundary of a worldsheet

changes the boundary condition from neumann (7-brane) to dirichlet (d-instanton) for
x i, i = 0,    , 7. such boundary condition changing operators can be constructed using
bosonic z2 twist elds, which are familiar from string compactications on orbifolds [23].
for a single complex boson the operator product expansion of the twist eld  is

(z)x(z) = (z  w)

1

2  (w) +   

(9)

here  is an excited twist eld. the conformal dimension of  is h = 1/8. the vertex

operator for the fermionic ground state of the string stretched between the seven brane

and the d-instanton is then given by

v = e1/21234e

1
2

h5 .

(10)

here i, i = 1,    , 4 are twist elds which change the boundary conditions for the eight
coordinates in the seven brane directions x 2i2 + ix 2i1, i = 1,    , 4. the conformal
dimension of the vertex (10) is h = 3/8 + 4  1/8 + 1/8 = 1. since a stretched open string
has one end on the d7 branes and the other on the d-instanton, the chan-paton factors
are transforming as (8, k) of so(8)  so(k). the only nontrivial coupling of the vertices
(7)(8) and (10) is given by the following three point function on the disk.

hcv(x1)cv (x2)cv(x3)i = hce(8  i9)(x1) ce

(11)

where c denotes the reparameterization ghosts, and inserting three of them xes the
moebius invariance of the disk amplitude. the vertex v a in (7) has been transformed into

5

the 1 picture in order to saturate the superghost anomaly on the disk. to evaluate (11)
note that the fermion in can be bosonized 8  i9 = exp(ih5). using the free eld
correlators is is easy to see that (11) is equal to a constant. similarly the calculations of
three point functions reveals that two  couple to 1 + i2 and two  couple to 1  i2.
denoting the wave functions of the bosonic vertices v i and v a as x i and a, the
fermionic vertices v  and v  with  and   respectively, the matrix mechanics governing

k d-instantons near 4 d7 branes on top of an orientifold seven plane is given by the

following action

s =

1
2

tr(cid:16) 1

2 [xi, xj]2 + [a, xi]2 + 1

2 [a, b]2 + ig[(1 + i2), ]

+ ig[(1  i2), ] + igi[x i, ](cid:17) + igi (1  i2)i.

(12)

this matrix action can also be deduced by applying a t-duality on action of the type i
d0 brane quantum mechanics [21][22]. the elds x i and  transform in the symmetric

second rank tensor representation of so(k) have a trace part which decouples from (12)
and are center of mass degrees of freedom. in particular the trace part of the fermion 

can be viewed as the fermionic collective coordinates associated with the broken supersym-

metries of the d-instanton in the d7-o7 background. in the absence of a second quantized

formulation of string theory the treatment of the d-instanton moduli space involves a cer-

tain amount of guesswork. using ideas which have worked well for iib instantons [24],

we will dene an integration over the collective coordinates as an integral over the matrix

degrees of freedom associated with the d-instanton weighted with the matrix action (12).

note that the trace part of  does not appear in the matrix action (12) hence the integra-

tion over these fermionic variables has to be saturated by additional insertions which will

produce instanton induced interaction vertices.

another important feature is the coupling of the bosonic eld 1  i2 to the
fermnionic degrees of freedom ,  and . the fermionic integrals are saturated by pulling

bilinears in the fermions from the action. this gives only a non vanishing result if there
are an equal number of 1 + i2 and 1  i2 appearing in this process, since otherwise the
phase integrations of  will kill the matrix integral. since for so(2k) matrix mechanics
the number of  is 8 2k(2k + 1)/2 8 and the number of  is 4 2k(2k  1)/2 it follows
that we need to pull down 8 (2k  1) s from the action (12). note that there are 8 2k
 altogether. this implies that the integration over eight  cannot be saturated by the
action and has to come from other insertions. note that the tr(i[x i, ]) term in (12)

6

saturates an equal number of  and  integrations and does not change the counting of

the decit above.

in summary the integration over eight trace components of  and eight  have to be
saturated by additional insertions. these insertion will be chosen here to produce the trf 4
and (trf 2)2 instanton induced interactions. since the so(8) gauge elds are associated

with the seven brane and the fermionic zero modes with the d-instanton, the simplest

string diagram which involves both is given by the disk with two boundary changing

(twist) operators (10) inserted such that a part of the boundary of the world sheet ends

on the seven brane and a part ends on the d-instanton. the simplest amplitude involves
one gauge eld vertex vf = fij(x ix j + iij) and two fermionic zero modes together
with two boundary condition changing operators (10) inserted. this amplitude has the
form (only the fij ij part of the vertex contributes).

(14)

the eight fermionic zero modes a associated with the supersymmetries broken by the

presence of the d instanton are soaked up by four disk diagrams (13). furthermore the

four disk diagrams also saturate the integrations over the eight remaining  and induce a
term with four f gauge elds. note that the integral over  reproduces the well known

kinematic tensor t8 since

z d8 ij kl mn pq = tijklmnpq

8

.

(15)

in the simplest case of of so(2) matrix mechanics it is straightforward to check that the
integration over  produces the factors tr(f 4) and (trf 2)2 in the correct relative normal-

ization as determined by (6).

it is a natural generalization of the arguments involving

type iib thresholds and su (n ) matrix integrals [24] that the threshold amplitudes (6)

are related to matrix integrals with action (12). since the matrix mechanics for so(2k)

for general k is very complicated we do not attempt to check this correspondence here,

although it would be very interesting to try to apply the methods of [26] to evaluate the

matrix integrals for arbitrary k. note that because of the insertions described above, a

certain correlation function involving eight  and not the partition function itself has to

be compared to the results given in this paper.

4. d-instanton in supergravity

the d-instanton solution of iib supergravity [27] is a bps solution which preserves

half the supersymmetries,

 = ip,

 = d.

(16)

where the scalar eld strength, covariant derivative and composite u (1) gauge eld are

dened as

p = i


22

, d = ( +

(17)

8

and the complex scalar given by a combination of rr scalar and dilaton  =  + ie.
solutions to (16) which are bps satisfy (in euclidean space)  = ie. the d-
instanton solution is then g =  and the dilaton satises

e = 0

(18)

i.e. the dilaton prole for a d-instanton centered at y is given in terms of a harmonic
function

e(x) = e0 +

2k4

4|x  y|8 .

(19)

when the three other singularities are far away the geometry in the vicinity of one of
the orientifold singularities on t 2/z2 is locally r2/z2. in the supergravity this implies that
under the inversion i xa  xa, a = 8, 9 transform according to the orientifold projection
(1)fli. in particular this relates at z to elds at z. from the 32 supersymmetries of
iib only sixteen satisfying

 = (1 + i89),

(20)

are unbroken by the orientifold projection.

since the dilaton and rr scalar sources of of four d7 branes on top of the orientifold

cancel locally, the d-instanton solution of iib (19) can be used to write down a solution

of the orientifolded iib supergravity.

we have to nd a solution which is invariant under the orientifold projection acting

on the elds of iib supergravity. since there is no nontrivial monodromy of  under the
orientifold projection it relating the elds at z and z . therefore the simplest invariant
dilaton prole

e(xi, z) = e0 +

2k4

4((x  x1)2 + |z  z1|2)4 +

2k4

4((x  x1)2 + |z + z1|2)4 .

(21)

where we split the coordinate x,  = 0,    , 9 into xi, i = 0,    , 7 and z, z. it is obvious
that(21) is invariant under z  z. since the solution (19) satises the charge quantization
condition minimally, i.e. corresponds to singly charged d-instanton, it is easy to see that

the projected instanton solution (21) has instanton charge 2. a stuck instanton can carry

instanton charge one

e(x, z) = e0 +

2k4

4((x  x1)2 + |z|2)4 ,

(22)

and is also invariant under z  z but cannot move away from the orientifold singularity
z = 0.

9

in [28] the d-instanton solution in ads5  s5 was discussed. since ads5  s5 is
conformally at the solution can easily be obtained from the at space d-instanton solution.

here we shall only be interested in the appropriately rescaled d-instanton solution in the

limit when the prole is evaluated at the boundary of ads5.

(23)

here o, x0 label the position of the d-instanton in the bulk and x is a coordinate on the
boundary of ads5. note that in the limit   0 the position on the s5 has disappeared
in particular this implies that even in the orientifolded ads5  s5 the d-
from (23).

instanton solution will be of the form (23) (with twice the charge).

5. n = 2 u sp(nc) theories and the ads/cft correspondence

as mentioned in the introduction a probe of nc d3 brane moving in sens z2 iib
orientifold produces a u sp(2nc) n = 2 gauge theory on the worldvolume with four hy-
permultiplets transforming in the fundamental and one hypermultiplet transforming in the

second rank antisymmetric tensor of u sp(2nc) [2]. the so(8) gauge symmetry on the d7
branes corresponds to a global so(8) symmetry of the four fundamental hypermultiplets.

the u sp(2nc) n = 2 with the matter content described above has vanishing beta
function and for zero higgs expectation values denes a conformal eld theory for any

integer value of nc. hence we can consider the large n limit.
correspondence was generalized to this conformal eld theory and it was shown that the
u sp(2nc) n = 2 theory is dual to iib supergravity on ads5  s5/z2. the metric on the
s5/z2 is given by

in [3][4] the ads/cft

ds2 = d2 + sin2()d2 + cos2()d2
3,

(24)

here   [0, ] is periodic with period  instead of 2 for an ordinary s5 and some of
the elds of iib supergravity have nontrivial monodromies as    +  [4]. the s3 can
be regarded as the xed point of the orientifold and the original sevenbranes are lling
ads5 and are wrapped on the s3 at  = 0. the changed periodicity and monodromy
of type iib elds modies the spectrum of the chiral primaries coming from the bulk of

the supergravity as analyzed in [3][4]. in addition there are chiral primaries coming from

elds localized on the seven branes [4]. such states carry so(8) charges. all elds in the

supergravity and eld theory are characterized by the charges they carry with respect to

su (2)r  su (2)l  u (1)r  so(8)  u sp(2n ),

(25)

10

where su (2)r u (1)r is identied with the r-symmetry of the the n = 2 superconformal
algebra and su (2)l can be interpreted as a avor symmetry of the ast hypermultiplet,

so(8) is a gauge symmetry on the d7 branes which is a global avor symmetry from the

perspective of the d3 branes and u sp(2n ) denotes the gauge symmetry of the d3 brane.
geometrically the su (2)l  su (2)r can be identied with the so(4) symmetry of the
s3.

on the ads side we will mainly be interested in the elds related to the vector

eld am of the heterotic string. in the ads limit this vector eld decomposes into three

dierent elds which are all transforming in the adjoint of so(8),

(k, k + 2)0 + (k + 2, k)0. where y k

firstly the m = 0,    , 4 components of the vector state are related to a vector eld
(x)y k(y) which transforms as (k, k)0 under under su (2)r 
in ads5 with a = pk ak
su (2)lu (1)r. where y k(y) is the k-th scalar kk mode on the 3 sphere. the m = 5, 6, 7
components are related to vectors with polarizations taking values in the tangent space of
s3, these states lead to scalar elds in the ads5. the aa =pk ak(x)y k
components are related to the scalar z =pk zk(x)y k(y) which transforms as (k, k)2.

a (y) transform as
a is the k-th vector spherical harmonics on s3. m = 8, 9

the part of the k = 1 kk mode of the internal vector aa which transforms as
(3, 1)0 represents a chiral primary with dimension  = 2 3 in the gauge theory side these
elds are identied with composite operators which are chiral primaries and have the same
dimension and quantum numbers. ak=1

is associated with the bilinear made of qi

a

z[ij] = q[i

a qj]

b j ab.

(26)

where qi are the scalars in the fundamental hypermultiplets, and j ab is the invariant

second rank u sp(2n ) tensor and we have suppressed the su (2)r indices. other members

of this supermultiplet can be obtained by acting with supercharges on the chiral primary
eld (26). of particular interest the k = 1 vector eld ak=1
has conformal dimension  = 3. the vector eld ak=1

transforms in the (1, 1)0 and
m is identied with the global so(8)



current

j [ij]
 = q[iqj] + i[ij],

(27)

3 a wz coupling of the rr four form potential and the gauge eld in the seven brane leads
to a split of the (3, 1)0 and (1, 3)0 and a shift of their masses, and only the (3, 1)0 component

corresponds to a chiral primary with  = 2 [4].

11

which is given by acting with q q on the chiral primary (26). furthermore the zk=1 scalar is
associated with elds qxq and  and is given by acting with q2 (or q2 for the conjugate)
on (26).

the four derivative threshold corrections in the heterotic string (6) are mapped to

d-instanton induced f 4 terms living on the sevenbrane in the iib orientifold.
in the
ads/cft correspondence the seven branes wrap the s3 and ll ads5 and they lead to
new bulk four point vertices in the ads5. using the relation of the heterotic vector elds
to the the vector am and and the scalars aa and z, (6) will lead to four point correlation
functions of these elds.

in the following the four point function involving four vector elds am in ads5 are

considered in detail, the four point vertices are given be the following expression,

here the indices m, n,    = 0,    4 denote coordinates in ads5 and the superscript in aa

labels a basis of the adjoint representation of so(8). the tensor t8 is constructed using
mn and the factor z8
0 in (28) comes from four inverse metrics. the functions fabcd and
gabcd in (28) contain the information about the d-instanton contribution and have the
following structure

t (cid:16)fabcd( ) + gabcd( )(cid:17).

using the prescription developed in [6] the vertices (28) contribute to a correlation function
in the cft of four so(8) currents, hj a(x1)j b(x2)j c(x3)j d(x4)i. this calculation
uses the bulk to boundary propagator for a vector eld in ads5, given by gm(z, x) which
relates the bulk gauge eld am(z) to the boundary values a(x). the bulk to boundary
propagator dened in [29] has the following form

gm(z, x) =

note that in (28) only the eld strength d[mgn](z, x) appears and this expression is
independent of the choice of gauge in (30). in addition the covariant derivative can be

12

replaced by an ordinary derivative and the result can be expressed in a simple manner

(30).

d[mgn](z, x) = [mgn](z, x) =

this constitutes a prediction for the instanton contributions to the four point correlator
of four j a. it is easy to generalize this calculation to the four point functions involving

the internal vector aa and the scalar z using (6), as well as all kaluza-klein descendants.

6. d-instantons and yang-mills instantons

the map between the parameters of sym and iib string theory on ads5  s5 is

given by

ga = q2

y m /4,  = y m /2, r2/ =qq2

y m n .

a rst indication that d-instanton eects are related to ym-instanton eects is given by
the observation that the action for a charge k d-instanton exp(2k/gs) is mapped to
the charge k ym-instanton action exp(8k/g2
y m ) [30]. in [28] more evidence for this
correspondence was found by considering the d-instanton solution of iib supergravity in
the ads5  s5 background. the gauge eld tr(f +)2 of an su (2) instanton of charge one
is given by

(34)

(35)

tr(f )2 =

4
g2
y m

4
0

(2

0 + (x  x0)2)4 .

13

remarkably agrees with the d-instanton solution in ads5s5 (23), where x a point at the
boundary and (0, x0) is the location of the d-instanton in the bulk of ads5. note that
the scale size  of the ym instanton is the position of d-instanton in the radial direction of

ads5. this relation is one example of the ir/uv relation in the gauge theory/supergravity
correspondence.

in an impressive series of papers [31] the predictions for instanton contributions to

correlators in the large nc limit of n = 4 su (nc) sym were conrmed using adhm
multi instanton calculus. one important fact which makes this correspondence possible
is that the threshold corrections like t8t8r4 in iib only receive perturbative contribution
at tree level and one loop. this implies that one can isolate the instanton contributions

reliably even in the large nc limit.

for the n = 2 conformal eld theory which arises in the iib orientifold discussed in

this paper a similar calculation of the instanton contribution in the gauge theory should be

possible. note that for u sp(2nc) theories with hypermultiplets transforming in the fun-
damental representation there is a avor parity symmetry [32][33] which implies that only

even instanton numbers contribute to these instanton induced interactions, in agreement

with (6).

a detailed analysis of the multi instanton adhm construction for u sp(2nc) n = 2
sym with the matter content described above is beyond the scope of the present paper.

it would be nevertheless very interesting to see whether all or some of the features of

the impressive n = 4 analysis [31] generalize in the case at hand. there are eight (in-

stead of sixteen) zero modes associated with the broken superconformal symmetries which

when soaked up by operator insertions should produce the four point correlators discussed

above. all the other fermionic zero modes have to be lifted by quadrilinear terms in the

multi instanton action. it would be interesting to see whether in the large nc saddle point
approximation the dominant contribution comes from a single copy of ads5 and whether
integrals in the k instanton partition functions appear producing the so(2k) matrix inte-

gral (12).

7. conclusions

in this paper d-instanton induced terms in the worldvolume of d7 branes in iib

orientifold were obtained by heterotic/type i duality from a one loop heterotic calculation.

in the following we attempted to apply the methods which were applied successfully for

thresholds in iib and their relation to d-instantons as well as the relation of d-instantons

14

in ads5  s5 and ym-instantons in n = 4 sym. it is not clear whether this approach
is justied since no independent check of the prediction coming from the heterotic loop

calculation have been performed, unlike in the case of n = 4 sym. it would therefore be

very interesting to perform such (rather nontrivial) checks. it would also be interesting to

analyze the type i formulation of the theory from the matrix string perspective [18][34].

the arguments presented in this paper can be generalized in various ways. it is easy

to calculate thresholds involving four gravitons, here the situation is more involved since

there can also be contributions from the ten dimensional bulk as well as higher curvature

terms living on the three branes [35]. the orientifold theory presented here is rather

special it is an open question whether other heterotic loop calculations can be related to

interesting quantities interesting conformal theories with n = 2 or n = 1 susy by similar

arguments given in the paper.

appendix a. details of the heterotic loop amplitude

in this appendix the calculation of one loop heterotic amplitudes with four gauge

elds is outlined. the method is adapted from [12] for the wilson line dened (1). the

(a.4)

the form of the operator q in (a.1) depends on the threshold in question. the operator
q for tr(f 4) and (tr(f 2))2 can be found by gauging (a.3)[7]. the wilson line (1) breaks
the gauge group to so(8)4 and the thirty two free fermions of the so(32) lattice are split
into four sets of eight in (a.3). the result depends on the spin structures [a, b] for the
eight fermions which are associated with the rst so(8) in (a.3). for the tr(f 4) threshold
the operators are given by

qtr(f 4)(cid:20) 1
qtr(f 4)(cid:20) 0
qtr(f 4)(cid:20) 0

appendix b. evaluation of integral

the integral (a.1) can be evaluated using the method of orbits [36]. in the present
context this technique was discussed in [17][37] and in [10], where type i thresholds with
certain wilson lines present were evaluated using results from [11]. without wilson lines
it is straightforward to show that under the modular sl(2, z) transformations  = (a +
b)/(c + d) with a, b, c, d  z,ad  bc = 1
=

the summation over all integer matrices matrices a can then replaced by the summation
over all equivalence classes of sl(2, z) orbits. there are three dierent cases, the trivial
orbit a = 0, the degenerate orbit det(a) = 0 and the non degenerate orbit det(a) 6= 0

in the following we will consider only the non degenerate orbit, where the fundamen-
tal f is unfolded into the double cover of the upper half plane h. the non degenerate
sl(2, z) orbits fall into the following equivalence classes

a = (cid:18) k

0

j

p(cid:19) ,

k > 0, 0  j < k, p  z.

(b.2)

when wilson lines are present, matters are more complicated but using the well known
transformation properties of the theta functions under    + 1,   1/ is is easy to
see that for both qtr(f )4 (a.5) and q(tr(f )2)2 (a.6), qc(y, a) dened in (a.3) behaves in
the following way

qc(y, a)(

a + b
c + d

) = qc(y, a(cid:18) a b

d(cid:19))( ).
