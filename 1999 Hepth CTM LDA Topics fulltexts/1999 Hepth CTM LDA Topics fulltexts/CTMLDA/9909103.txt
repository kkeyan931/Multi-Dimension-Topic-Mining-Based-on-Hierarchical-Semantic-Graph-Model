(2.1) convenient write independent components metric 3 a(y) = e(y) , b(y) = e(y) . (2.2) energy-momentum tensor chosen diagonal, non-vanishing components 0 0 , j =(cid:16)t 0 0 (cid:17) j , 5 5 . (2.3) decompose matter action part living (4+1) dimensional bulk, part living n three-branes by(n). consequently 0 decomposed bulk brane parts, whereas 5 0 also 5 depends action bulk: 0 = (bulk) 0 0 0 + b1(y)xn (cid:16)y by(n)(cid:17) (brane n) 0 0 , (2.4a) 5 = (bulk) 5 5 5 . (2.4b) consider einstein equations (4 + 1) dimensional universe. general non-static case derived binetruy, deayet langlois {$9905012$}; static case simplify (using notation (2.2)) e(cid:16) + 22 (cid:17) = 2 3 e 0 0 , e 2 = 2 6 e 5 5 . (2.5a) (2.5b) primes denote derivatives respect y, denotes dimen- sional gravitational constant. (i, j) components einstein equations provide independent informations. now, dierence eqs. (2.5a) (2.5b) one obtains e(cid:16) + 2 (cid:17) = 2 3 e(cid:18)t 0 0 1 2 5 5 (cid:19) , (2.6) written 4 y(cid:16)e(cid:17) = 2 3 e+(cid:18)t 0 0 1 2 5 5 (cid:19) . (2.7) point compactness 5th dimension becomes crucial. assume conned nite interval i, or, alternatively, physical elds (y) (y) periodic, (y + i) = (y) (y + i) = (y). consequently integral dy interval left hand-side (2.7) vanishes; note argument holds also presence branes, second y-derivatives singular. returning notation b instead , omitting constant factors, one derives eq. (2.7) zi dy a(y) b(y)(cid:16)2t 0 0 5 5 (cid:17) = 0 . (2.8) although topological argument used order derive eq. (2.8), represent general topological constraint: represents instead necessary condition existence static solution einstein equations, i.e. (practi- cally) vanishing hubble constant. sense eq. (2.8) replaces four dimensional constraint (1.1b), vanishing cosmological constant. one decomposes energy-momentum tensor bulk brane parts eqs. (2.4), eq. (2.8) becomes zi dy a(y)(b(y) (cid:16)2t (bulk) 0 0 (bulk) 5 5 (cid:17) + 2xn (cid:16)y by(n)(cid:17) (brane n) 0 0 ) = 0 . (2.9) trivially, absence matter action bulk single three-brane, eq. (2.9) collapses constraint (1.1b). whereas constraints (2.8) (2.9) global 5th dimension, actually possible one additional assumption derive another constraint involves energy-momentum tensor given brane: let us assume given brane situated = 0, let us consider einstein equations (2.5) near = 0. right hand side eq. (2.5a) involves singular term (y)t (brane) 0 0 , cancelled singularity left hand side. assumption (y) symmetric (e.g. case s1/z2 orbifold geometry, see next section) condition allows obtain brane: 5 depend |y|, one near = 0, dots denote regular terms. then, one obtains eq. (2.5a) (y) = 2(0)(y) + . . . (2.10) hence, eq. (2.5b) = 0, (0) = 2 6 et (brane) 0 0 2 6 (t (brane) 0 0 )2 (bulk) 5 5 (0) = 0 . (2.11) (2.12) condition also derived results binetruy, deayet langlois {$9905012$}, coincides one constraints required solution randall sundrum . noted, however, symmetry assumption (y) completely independent form energy- momentum tensor along 5th dimension. next, would like express general constraint (2.8) (2.9) terms action involving matter bulk branes. since possible lorentz invariant vacuum congurations y-dependent scalar elds i(y) (up duality transformations 3-forms 5 dimensions), restrict general non-linear sigma model action (neglecting higher derivatives) sigma model metric gij() arbitrary potentials bulk branes. (actually, presence gauge elds bulk, could also wilson lines along compact 5th dimension. do, however, contribute energy-momentum tensor). taking already account that, vacuum, derivatives elds except respect vanish, general action bulk branes reads (using metric (2.1)) s() = z d5x a4(y)nb(y)(cid:16)gij() yi yj + v (bulk)()(cid:17) (2.13) +xn (cid:16)y by(n)(cid:17) v (brane n)()o .

(2.15), general condition static universe compared constraints specic scenarios non-conventional cosmology brane universe {$9905012$}, generation hierarchies . cases scalar elds exist, i.e. rst term (2.15) vanishes, potentials constants (with v (bulk) = 0 {$9905012$}). inserting solution a(y) (and b(y) = 1)  (2.15), using v (brane 2) = v (brane 1), one obtains indeed second constraint vacuum energies bulk branes, compared eq. (2.12), . likewise, v (bulk) = 0 last term survives (2.15), resulting constraint agrees eq. (46) {$9905012$}. (notably, static universe assumed {$9905012$} order obtain constraint; follows generally solution a(y) presence 2 three-branes without energy-momentum tensor bulk). noted that, general, local constraints (2.12) brane global constraint (2.9) independent, explains presence two conditions static universe {$9905012$} . whereas previous results (2.8), (2.9), (2.12) (2.15) general, practical application least presence matter bulk complicated fact requires knowledge vacuum solutions a(y), b(y) i(y). (3 + 1) dimensional case, analogous constraint (1.1b) implies 7 well-known condition vanishing scalar potential minimum. likewise, would like translate previous results condition action (2.13). case 2 three-branes suciently close other, able derive condition next chapter. 3 2 close three-branes motivated compactication m-theory 11 5 dimensions calabi-yau manifold xcy {$9811133$}, consider 5th dimension geometry orbifold s1/z2. choose interval  endpoints identied. two three-branes located by(1) = 0 by(2) = , z2 orbifold symmetry acts y. scenario h1,1 moduli xcy appear 5 dimensions scalar elds non-trivial potentials bulk branes {$9811133$}. notably, potentials proportional coecients i, given integrals r r r corresponding four-cycles ci xcy . general o(cid:16)m 4 gu /m 3 11(cid:17) , (3.1) 6 gu inverse size xcy , m11 scale eleven-dimensional terms potentials moduli gravitational coupling. respective orders  v (brane 1)(i) = v (brane 2)(i) = o() , v (bulk)(i) = o(2) .
