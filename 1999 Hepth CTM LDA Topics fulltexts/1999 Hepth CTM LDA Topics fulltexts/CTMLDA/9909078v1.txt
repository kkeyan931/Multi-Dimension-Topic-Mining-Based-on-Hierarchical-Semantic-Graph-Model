abstract

we introduce an explicit form of the multi-instanton weight including also instanton
anti-instanton interactions for arbitrary nc in the two-dimensional c p nc1 model.
to that end, we use the parametrization of multi-instantons in terms of instanton
constituents which we call zindons for short. we study the statistical mechanics of
zindons analytically (by means of the debye-huckel approximation) and numerically
(running a metropolis algorithm). though the zindon parametrization allows for a
complete melting of instantons we nd that, through a combination of dynamical
and purely geometric factors, a dominant portion of topological charge is residing in
well-separated instantons and anti-instantons.

1 introduction

in the last two decades there have been much evidence that the specic uctuations of the
gluon eld carrying topological charge, called instantons, play a very important role in the
dynamics of qcd, the theory of strong interactions [1, 2]. instantons are most probably
responsible for one of the main features of strong interactions, namely for the spontaneous
breaking of chiral symmetry [3]. whether they play a role in the connement property of
qcd is, however, not clear. the diculty in addressing this problem may be connected to
the fact that, strictly speaking, the multi-instanton solution in the vacuum is not known.
instead, in a dilute-gas approximation, one treats the instanton vacuum as a superposi-
tion of one-instanton solutions. for large distances the one-instanton gluon eld falls o
as a(x)  1/x3, which means that correlations between instantons at large distances are
vanishing in the dilute-gas picture. however, the connement phenomenon by itself seems
to indicate that certain correlations of gluon elds do not fall o when the distance is in-
creased. therefore, if instantons are of any relevance to connement, it cannot be seen in
the dilute-gas approximation: one has to enrich the arsenal of instanton methods.

this motivates us to study a system where the multi-instanton solution is known, where
one can nd many features of the strong interaction, and which is simple enough to allow for
analytic solutions in some limits. such a system is provided by the two-dimensional cp nc1
model. this model is known to possess both asymptotic freedom and instantons. contrary
to the d = 4 yangmills theory where the multi-instanton solutions are not available in an
explicit form, in the cp nc1 model they are known explicitly, and for any number of colors
nc [4, 5]. moreover, the multi-instanton weight arising from integrating out quantum oscil-
lations about instantons is also known [6, 7, 8]. in addition, the model is exactly solvable
at large nc [5, 9], and the spectrum is known for all nc [10]. therefore, the model is well
suited to monitor instantons in a controllable way. it should be added that the model has
been much studied by lattice simulations (see, e.g. [11, 12, 13]), and instantons have been
identied there by a cooling procedure [14].

since the pioneering paper of fateev, frolov and schwartz [6] it has been known that
the multi-instanton system in the o(3) sigma model resembles that of a two-dimensional
coulomb plasma; it can be exactly bosonized to produce a sine-gordon theory. in a true vac-
uum, however, one has both instantons and anti-instantons; such a system can be bosonized
and solved exactly only at a specic value of the coupling [15] which may not be realistic.
therefore, the general case still remains a dicult and unsolved dynamical problem.

in sec. 2 we overview the cp nc1 model. in sec. 3 we derive the general partition function
for the cp nc1 in terms of a special form of instanton variables, which are called zindons. in
sec. 4 we shall describe an approximation to the partition function called the debye-huckel
approximation, which is capable to account for many features of the instanton ensemble.

2

however, that approximation is in general insucient. therefore, in this paper we combine
analytical study of the instantonanti-instanton ensemble with a numerical simulation. in
sec. 5 we describe the metropolis algorithm used to study the behavior of the model in monte
carlo simulations. it will turn out that, strictly speaking, the instanton ensemble does not
exist for nc = 2 and that a regularization procedure is required to yield meaningful results.
in sec. 6 we consider the question whether the system has a thermodynamically stable den-
sity, i.e., whether the average number of instantons and anti-instantons grows proportional
to the volume of the system. finally in sec. 7 we have a look at the size distribution, both
seen from the instanton input and from the topological charge density.

2 the cp nc1 model

for a number of colors nc the main objects of the cp nc1 model are nc complex elds
a=1 |va|2 one can introduce the normalized

va(x), a = 1, . . . , nc. dening the norm |v|2 = pnc

elds ua, a projector p and the unitary operator g via:

ua = va/|v|,

pab = uau
b,

p 2 = p = p ,

g = g,

g = 1  2p,
g2 = 1.

one can introduce a vector potential a and a covariant derivative :

a =

i
2

(uau

a  u

aua),

 =   ia,

( = 1, 2) .

(1)

(2)

a is a real eld, depending on the x-space variables x and y that can be identied with the
complex variables z = x + iy and z = x  iy. the eld strength tensor and the topological
charge density are:

f = a  a,

q(x) =

1
4

f = i
2

u

aua.

the theory is determined by the action

s = z d2x

nc

xa=1|ua|2 =

1

8 z d2xtr [gg] ,

and the partition function is:

z = z dua(x)du
= z dua(x)du

a(x)da(x)(|u|2  1) exp 
a(x)(|u|2  1) exp 

g2 z d2x|ua|2!
8g2 z d2xtr[gg]! .

(5)

this formulates a nonlinear theory of self-interacting elds, where the nonlinearity is forced
by the condition |u| = 1. there is a topological charge q in the theory dened as:
16 z d2x  tr [ggg] .

4 z d2x f =

q = z d2x q(x) =

(6)

1

2 i dxa =

i

because of its unitarity g has the property gg = gg, which can be used to show:

0  z d2xtr [(g  igg) (g  igg)] = 16(s  2q) .

(7)

this tells that the minimal action for a given topological charge of a eld conguration, i.e.
a solution of the equation of motion, is obtained if the eld satises the self-duality equation:

g  i gg = 0  v  iv = 0.

(8)

introducing the complex derivative z = (x  iy)/2, it means that one nds two types of
solutions:
(9)

zv = 0  s = 2q

and

which are the cauchyriemann conditions [16]. one calls the rst an instanton solution and
the second one an anti-instanton solution.

zv = 0  s = 2q ,

(10)

3 zindons

a general multi-instanton solution of the self-duality eq. (9) with topological charge q = n+
is a product of monomials in z [6]:

vinst
a = ca

n+

yi=1
(z  aai),

a = 1, ..., nc.

(11)

similarly, a general multi anti-instanton solution of eq. (10) with topological charge q =
n is a product of monomials in the complex conjugate variable z:

vanti
a = c
a

n

(z  b
yj=1

aj),

a = 1, ..., nc.

(12)

for a general conguration with n+ instantons and n anti-instantons we shall consider a
product ansatz [15]:

n+

n

va =

yi=1
(z  aai)

(z  b
yj=1

aj),

4

(13)

where aia and bja are xed 2-dim points written as complex numbers. those points have been
called instanton quarks or instanton constituents in the past. we suggest a shorter term
zindon to denote these entities, in analogy with similar objects introduced in the yangmills
theory [17]. zindon is tajik or persian word for castle or prison; they are of relevance to
describe connement in the model. there are, thus, nc types or colors of the instanton zin-
dons (denoted by aa) and nc types of anti-instanton zindons or anti-zindons (denoted by ba).

the action and the topological charge for such a multi-instantonanti-instanton ansatz are

s

a =

|v|2 =

xa=1|va|2.

the topological charge can be immediately found from the cauchy theorem:

q =

1

2 i dxa = n+  n .

the geometric meaning of the zindon coordinates becomes especially clear if one takes a
single-instanton solution, va(z) = ca(z  aa). putting it into the action eq. (14) one gets
the standard form of the instanton prole,

s = 2q = 2z d2x

2

[(x  x0)2 + 2]2 = 2,

where the instanton center x0 is given by the center of masses of zindons,

(14)

(15)

(16)

(17)

x0 = pnc
a=1 |ca|2aa
pnc
a=1 |ca|2

,

while the spread of the eld called the instanton size  is given by the spatial dispersion of
zindons comprising the instanton,

2 = pnc

a=1 |ca|2|aa  x0|2
pnc
a=1 |ca|2

= pa<b |ca|2|cb|2|aa  ab|2

(pa |ca|2)2

.

(18)

in eqs.(17, 18) all coordinates x0, aa are understood as 2-dimensional vectors. in the multi-
instanton case the action and topological charge densities will have extrema not necessarily
coinciding with the position of the zindon center of masses. only when a group of zindons of

5

all nc colors happens to be well spatially isolated from all the rest zindons, in the vicinity of
this group one can speak about getting a classical instanton prole (16) with the collective
coordinates given by eqs.(17, 18), the role of the coecients ca played by a product of
separations between a given zindon aai and all the rest zindons and anti-zindons,

n+

n

|ca|2 =

yi6=i|aai  aai|2

yj=1|aai  baj|2.

(19)

as a matter of fact, it means that there is no need in introducing explicitly extra degrees of
freedom ca. it should be added that in the thermodynamic limit, with the system volume v
going to innity, we expect the number of zindons to be proportional to v . meanwhile, the
number of the coecients ca is xed (equal to nc). therefore, one can neglect this degree
of freedom as it plays no role in the thermodynamic limit; we shall therefore put all ca = 1.

the quantum determinants in the multi-instanton background, dening the instanton weight
or the measure of integration over collective coordinates aai, has been computed in ref. [6]
in case of nc = 2 (which is the o(3) sigma model) and in refs. [7, 8] for arbitrary cp nc1;
the results of these references coincide up to notations.

3.1 multi-instanton weight in the case nc = 2

in the nc = 2 case the multi-instanton weight is that of the coulomb gas [6, 8]:

c(2)


(20)

where  is the renormalization-invariant combination of the bare charge g2 and of the uv
cuto m needed to regularize the theory; it is the analog of qcd. the numerical coecient
c(2) depends on the regularization scheme used; in the paulivillars scheme it has been
found in ref. [18] to be

c(2) = (cid:18)2

e(cid:19)6 3

2 = 0.04822082 .

(21)

we shall absorb this constant in the denition of .
in the one-loop approximation the
charge g2 in eq. (20) remains unrenormalized; in two loops it starts to run. it is interesting
that for accidental reasons (the number of zero modes per unit topological charge, equal
four, coinciding with the ratio of the second-to-rst gell-mannlow coecients, equal to
b/b = 4nc/nc = 4) the coupling g2 does not run in the two-loop approximation either:
2/g2 in eq. (20) should be just replaced by (b/2)b/2b = 1. for anti-instanton zindons baj
one has a similar expression, with n+ replaced by n. we denote the corresponding weight
by db  wb.

3.2 partition function for arbitrary nc

the general expression for the multi-instanton weight wa in the cp nc1 model is [7, 8]:

va =

yi=1

ca(z  aai) .

(22)

in the following we set |ca| = 1 for reasons explained above. the second (integral) term in
eq. (22) can be analytically computed only for nc = 2; it gives the coulomb interaction of
eq. (20). for nc > 2 we approximate the integral term by a simpler explicit expression.
to that end, let us consider a conguration with zindons of nc colors forming clusters well
separated from each other, see fig. 1. we denote the centers of clusters by xi,

xi =

the sizes of the instantons associated with those clusters by i,

and the separation between clusters by

rij = |xi  xj| ,

(23)

(24)

(25)

assuming r2

ij  2

i,j. in such geometry the integral term can be easily evaluated, yielding

i{aai} =

(26)

we would like to write the functional of zindon positions i{aai} in such a way that it
(a) depends only on the separations between individual zindons, aai  abj ;
(b) is symmetric under permutations of same-color zindons, (aai  aaj);
(c) reduces to eq. (26) in the dilute regime;

7

(d) at nc = 2 comes to the exact expression valid for any geometry:

n+

i nc=2{aai} = 
xi,j=1


ln(a1i  a2j)2 + n+(1  ln 2)
 .

(27)

the solution to this problem is, naturally, not unique. we shall suggest two forms of ap-
proximate expressions for i{aai}, both satisfying the above requirements a-d. the rst form
is

n+

i{aai} = 

nc

(aai  abj)2# +

2

nc

n+(ln nc  1)

combining it with other terms in (22) we get the following multi-instanton weight:

nc

xi,i=1

ln" nc
xa<b

(aai  abi)22#

(28)

(29)

this form of the interactions between zindons belonging to instantons will be used in com-
puter simulations of the ensemble, see below. this form is, however, inconvenient for analyt-

ical estimates since it involves many-body interactions represented by lnpa<b(aai  abi)2.

therefore, we suggest a more simple second form involving only two-body interactions:

i{aai} = 

1

nc  1

n+

nc

xi,j=1

xa<b

ln(aai  abj)2 +

nc
2

n+(ln nc  1) .

(30)

the second form reproduces correctly only the leading term in (22) in the dilute regime;
however it is exact for nc = 2. consequently, the multi-instanton weight can be written in
a compact form:

wa = exp



2

nc
nc  1

n+

xi,j=1

nc

xa,b=1pab ln(aai  abj)22


(31)

here pab is a projector nc  nc matrix such that pab = (nc  1)/nc when a = b and
pab = 1/nc when a 6= b, so that p 2 = p, and p has nc1 unit eigenvalues and one zero.
in both forms, (29) and (31), we have introduced an inverse temperature  for future
convenience, in fact  = 1. we have also borrowed certain powers of the scale  from the

8

overall weight coecient to make the arguments of the logarithms dimensionless. a com-
parison of numerical simulations using the weight (29) with analytical calculations using the
weight (31) shows that the results do not dier signicantly; it means that ensembles gener-
ated with the two weights are to a good accuracy equivalent. at nc = 2 they both coincide
with the exact weight (20). for the multianti-instanton weight wb one can use either of
the forms (29), (31) with an obvious substitution of the instanton-zindon coordinates aai by
anti-zindon coordinates bai.

finally, we turn to the instantonanti-instanton interaction factor wab. we assume that
it is mainly formed by the classical defect of the action,

wab = exp 

1

g2 uint(a, b)! ,

uint(a, b) = sansatz  2(n+ + n),

(32)

where sansatz is the action computed on the product ansatz, (13). again, it is possible to
evaluate this quantity in a regime, when zindons belonging to denite instantons or anti-
instantons are grouped together and are well separated from other groups. after some work
one obtains the classical interaction potential between zindons and anti-zindons in a form of
dipole interactions in two dimensions, valid for any number of colors nc:

uint = 8 xall i i pairs

1

nc xa

(aa  xa)(ba  xb)

r2 (cid:18)  2

rr

r2 (cid:19) ,

xa =

a1 + ... + anc

nc

,

xb =

b1 + ... + bnc

nc

,

r = xa  xb.

(33)

in terms of zindons, this is a many-body interaction, however, eq. (33) can be rewritten
as a pair interaction of individual zindons, which, naturally, appears to be of a coulomb
type. this is one of the great advantages of using the zindon parametrization of instantons.
we rewrite the dipole interaction (33) as a sum of two-body interactions using the nc  nc
projector pab introduced above:

uint = 

4
nc

n+

xi=1

n

xj=1

nc

xa,b=1pab ln|aai  bbj|2.

(34)

in the case when groups of nc zindons form clusters well separated from groups of nc
anti-zindons, this reduces to the dipole interaction (33). notice that the interaction of
same-color zindons is repulsive while that of dierent-color is attractive. at nc = 2 the
projector matrix pab is

(35)

so that the interaction becomes just a sum of coulomb interactions between charges of
dierent signs. in this case this form has been known previously [18, 15]. in ref. [15] it has

1

p nc=2
ab =

2   1 1

1 ! ,

1

9

been shown that this form of the interaction possesses an additional conformal symmetry,
and one can think that its domain of validity in the zindon conguration space is wider than
the one where it has been actually derived. we shall, thus, use for the mixed instanton
anti-instanton weight:

wab = exp

the full partition function takes the form (for arbitrary instanton angle ):

z = xn+,n

ein+

(n+!)nc

ein

(n!)nc z dadb2nc(n++n)wawbwab

(36)

(37)

with wab given by (36), and wa,wb given either by (29) or (31). if one uses the form (31)
the interpretation is especially clear: the partition function describes two systems of zindons
(instanton and anti-instanton ones) experiencing logarithmic coulomb interactions, whose
strength is nc  1 times stronger for same-color zindons than for dierent-color zindons.
one has attraction for zindonsanti-zindons of dierent color and repulsion for zindons
anti-zindons of the same color. at nc = 2 one can think of the ensemble as of that of
e+, e, +,  particles [15]. the interaction of opposite-kind zindons are suppressed by an
additional factor 1 = 2/(g2nc). it is actually a running coupling, depending on the scale in
the problem. since there is only one scale here, the density of zindons at the thermodynamic
equilibrium, this 1 should be found self-consistently from the arising equilibrium density at
the end of the calculations.

4 the debye-huckel approximation

to get an insight in the dynamics of the system by simple analytical methods we consider
here the so-called debye-huckel approximation to the partition function (37). let us consider
rst a general case of a statistical ensemble of f kinds of particles with two-body interactions
given by:

uint = xij

uint(xi  xj) .

(38)

the number of particles of kind f is nf , f = 1, . . . , f . one writes the partition function for
xed numbers of particles as:

z = ef =

1

n1! . . . nf ! z

f

nf

yf =1

yif =1

dxf

if euint ,

(39)

10

where f is the helmholtz free energy and xf are coordinates of particles of kind f . the
one-particle density of particles of kind f is dened as:

nf (xf

1 ) =

1
z

z dxf

1 nf (xf

1 ) = 1 ,

1

n1!   nf ! z dxf

2    dxf

nf yg6=f

ng

yig=1

dxg

ig euint ,

(40)

which diers from the full partition function by that one does not integrate over the coor-
dinates of one particle of kind f . similarly, one can introduce the two-particle density by
avoiding integrating over coordinates of particle f and of particle g:

nf g(xf

1 , xg

2) =

1
z

1

n1!   nf ! z dxf

2 . . . dxf

nf dxg

1dxg

3    dxg

ng yh6=f

h6=g

this function can be written as

nf g(xf

1 , xg

2) = nf (xf

1)ng(xg

2)ef g(xf

1 xg

2) ,

nh

yih=1

dxh

iheuint .

(41)

(42)

which serves as a denition of the two-particle correlation function f g(x1, x2). if this func-
tion is zero the particles are not correlated. introducing, in the similar fashion, higher-order
densities, one can derive an (innite) chain of equation for those densities. the so-called
correlation energy is:

ecorr = 

1

2 xf g

nf ng

v 2

z z dx1dx2uf g(x1  x2)ef g(x1x2) .

(43)

knowing the correlation energy as function of temperature one can restore the helmholtz
free energy from the general relation:

ecorr =




(f ) .

(44)

the debye-huckel approximation consists in assuming that f g is small and linearizing
the equations [19].
in the
debye-huckel approximation it is also convenient to pass to the fourier transforms of the
pair interaction potential uf g and of the correlation function f g. the basic equations from
where one nds the correlation functions take the form:

it is usually justied, when the temperature is high,   0.

f g(k) = uf g(k) + xh

nh
2v

[ugh(k)f h(k) + uf h(k)gh(k)] .

(45)

in our case the particles are zindons belonging either to instantons or to anti-instantons.
let us denote ua1a2, a1a2 the interaction and the correlation of zindons of color a1, a2

11

belonging to instantons. similarly, u b1 b2,  b1 b2 refer to zindons belonging to anti-instantons.
and ua b, a b refer to instanton zindons of color a and anti-instanton zindons of color b.
the approximation is applicable only if all interactions are two-body. for that reason we
choose to work with the instanton weights given by eqs. (31), (36):

z = xn+, n

ein+

(n+!)nc

ein

(n!)nc z dadb 2nc(n++n) wa wbwab .

(46)

since our interactions are all of the logarithmic type the fourier transforms of uf g can be
written as:

ua1a2(k) = va1a2

u b1 b2(k) = v b1 b2

va1a1 = 1,

v b1 b1 = 1,

ua b(k) = va b

va a = 21

if a1 6= a2,
if b1 6= b2,

nc

if a 6= b .

(47)

it is now convenient to change the notation for the  correlation functions to:

aa = 1,  aa
a6=a

= 2,  b b = 3,  b b
b6= b

= 4, a b = 5,  a b
b 6=a

= 6.

(48)

the above relations for the vs induce similar relations for the s:

2 = 

1

nc  1

1, 4 = 

1

nc  1

3, 6 =

nc  1

5 .

returning to the x-space we observe that all correlation functions are exponentially de-
creasing at large separations between zindons, as contrasted to the original logarithmically
growing interactions. this phenomenon is usually referred to as debye screening; in our
case it takes the particular form of eq. (52).

notice that the density is stable in the thermodynamic limit v  . at || = 1 corre-
sponding to the value of the instantonanti-instanton interaction constant 1 =  nc
2(nc1) the
system becomes unstable. this could be anticipated from direct inspection of (37): at that
value of 1 the attraction between zindons of dierent color belonging to instantons and to
anti-instantons exceeds the repulsion between same-kind zindons, and the system collapses.

13

it should be stressed that all quantities involved (like the instanton density n, the screening
masses 1,2 etc.) are stable in the limit nc  . this should be contrasted to the old con-
jecture by witten [9] that instantons die out in the large nc limit. though this conjecture
has been criticized later on [20, 21] it remains a widely-believed prejudice.

5 the metropolis algorithm and regularization proce-

dure

the numerical treatment of instantons in the cp nc1 model is problematic for nc = 2, where
the theory is equal to the two-dimensional o(3) model. the partition function in this case

involves a product of integrals of the type r d2/2 and is therefore ultraviolet divergent.
there are two ways of imposing a regularization. the rst consists in decreasing the powers
in the interactions (20). physically, this is equivalent to the introduction of a temperature
t  1/, see eqs. (29),(31), and (36). we reach the physical limit by taking   1. for
small values of  we expect the model to be consistent with the predictions of the debye-
huckel approximation. the second possibility is using an ultraviolet cuto . technically,
this can be easiest done by changing the logarithmic interaction between zindons:

ln(aai  aai)2  lnh(aai  aai)2 + 2i ,

etc .

(56)

in both cases the physical limit t  1 and   0 does not exist for the free energy, however
one can get meaningful results for physical quantities that are connected to derivatives of the
free energy. an unpleasant point is that this  regularization destroys the scaling properties
of the theory. we can restore the scaling property by using  = /l as a regularization
parameter. then we restore the original scaling property which we express here in terms of
the free energy f :

f (, n, l) = ln z(, n, l) = n ln(l2) + ln z(, n) .

(57)

note that the reduced partition function z(, n) does no longer depend on l. it is exactly
this scaling property which will be important later when we try to reconstruct the average
density of instantons and anti-instantons in the system. we should emphasize that the price
we have to pay for the restoration of the scaling behavior is that the two limits   0
and l   cannot be interchanged, as with growing l the eective cuto  = l becomes
larger than the average separation between zindons, hri = 1/n. however, when  becomes
smaller the physical region where  = l < hri covers larger portions of the conguration
space.

to study the behavior of the system numerically we rst switch o the interaction between
instantons and anti-instantons i.e. we put 1 = 0. we then have for nc = 2 the case of

14

a simple coulomb gas, where the two dierent colors interact in the same way as the two
dierent electric charges. in the case of larger nc we have a more complicated multicolor
interaction which would then require a picture with nc dierent kind of charges.

the variables of integrations for the theory are the zindon coordinates aai and bai. a
direct numerical calculation of the partition function (37) is technically not possible, be-
cause the integrand has very sharp maxima: a small variation of the zindon coordinates
changes its value by orders of magnitude. instead of this one can apply a metropolis algo-
rithm: starting with a random conguration of zindons, step by step the position of one
zindon is varied by a small amount.
if the new conguration has a larger value of the
weight wawbwab then this conguration is accepted, if not then it is only accepted with the
probability wawbwab(new)/wawbwab(old). as fig. 2 shows, the plateau of important cong-
urations is reached only after 250.000 metropolis sweeps for nc = 3, 4. in the case nc = 2
the number of steps necessary to reach the plateau depends on the regularization parameter
: it is large when  is small. in fig. 2 we have chosen 2 = 0.001. already after 20.000
steps one is very close to the plateau here. it is now interesting to make a snapshot of the
distribution of the zindons at the plateau region. in fig. 3 we show snapshots of the zindon
ensemble at the plateau region after 500.000 metropolis steps with 1 = 0. each symbol
represents zindons of one color. one observes clearly, that for nc = 2 zindons of dierent
colors tend to condense into neutral pairs that can be very densely packed. this is the
reason for the fact that the partition function is divergent and needs to be regularized in
the way described above. such a condensation does not take place for higher colors nc = 3, 4.

we can put this in a more quantitative way by plotting the free energy f = ln z as a
function of the regularization parameter , see fig. 4. as it should be expected by simple
power counting the free energy for the case nc = 2 diverges proportional to ln(ln(1/)),
while it is nite in the case of higher nc. in principle such a divergence does not pose a real
problem since physical quantities are only related to logarithmic derivatives of the partition
function, but it does aect the eectiveness of the numerical studies considerably. in fact,
with the computer powers used, it was not possible to go to 2 smaller than 0.001, which
is not very small. the smaller 2 becomes the larger are the uctuations in the partition
functions until a point is reached where we do not get any equilibrium within a reasonable
time at all. we have to conclude from this that the nc = 2 case is not a good system to be
studied numerically.

6 the stability of the instantonanti-instanton ensem-

ble

15

6.1 the case nc = 2

the rst question is whether this system has a thermodynamic equilibrium, i.e. whether its
density does not change with the system volume l2, when l is large. we start again with the
coulomb gas of two noninteracting ensembles of instantons and anti-instantons, i.e. (1 = 0)
and nc = 2. here it is sucient to consider the instantons alone. in this case we simply
have n = n+ and we plot the logarithm of the partition function, i.e. the free energy as a
function of the number of instantons n. the ideal situation would be now that the number
nmax, where the partition function has a maximum, is proportional to l2. then one could
continue this situation to an innite instanton ensemble with the same density. in fig. 5 we
show the partition function for the coulomb gas as a function of the number of instantons
n for various box lengths l. the simulation is done with the uv cuto 2 = 0.001. one
sees that the free energy is plagued by large uctuations that correspond to uctuations in
orders of magnitude in the partition function. a direct determination of the maximum of
the free energy is not reliable. instead, one can exploit the expected scaling behavior. if the
system has a stable density then the free energy must be of the form:

f (, n, l) = ln z(, n, l) = n{ln(l2)  [ln(n)  1  ln(n+())]} + a ,

(58)

with the two t constants a and n+(), and  = /l being xed in order to preserve the
scaling behavior of the initially unregularized theory. eq. (58) is obtained in the following
way: from the inspection of eq. (37) it is clear that the free energy depends on l via
n ln(l2). requiring now that the number n at the maximum of the free energy f is
proportional to l2 leads to a dierential equation with the solution given by eq. (58).
eq. (58) has the advantage that n+() gives immediately the density of the system. the
symbol n+ refers to the instanton density. unfortunately, the system does not exhibit a
stable density. the reason is, again, the tendency of the system to condense into neutral
pairs corresponding to small-size instantons. when it happens, it is not reasonable anymore
to write down the particle-identity factor 1/(n!)2 in the partition function:
it should be
rather replaced by the rst power of the factorial. therefore, we allow for an additional
conbinatorical defect term in the t, which reads  ln n!, so that the full t function has
now the form:

ft(, n, l) = n{ln(l2)  [ln(n)  1  ln(n+())]} +  ln n! + a .

(59)

the smooth solid lines in fig. 5 are the tted curves, which t quite well to the heavily
uctuating free energy. one should expect that the defect becomes smaller when  becomes
smaller. as shown in tab. 1, one sees indeed such a behavior.

now arises the question how reliable our simulations are, because so far we did not nd
strictly speaking a stable system. the situation is also not very comfortable because in the
limit  = 0, where a stable phase should exist the density n+ is divergent for nc = 2. we

16

therefore study now a dierent regularization method: it consists in introducing a tempera-
ture t = 1/ in the zindon interactions, with  < 1. we reach the physical limit by taking
  1. for small values of  we expect behavior of the system to be consistent with the
predictions of the debye-huckel approximation. in fig. 6 we show the free energy for  = 0.1
versus the number of instantons n. the solid lines are the ts using the form:

ft, debye(n, l) = n{ln(l2)  [ln(n)  1  ln(n+,debye)]} + a .

(60)

we nd a stable density for various box lengths l. the ve curves yield a value for
n+ = 1.06787  0.0024, which is in agreement with the prediction of the debye-huckel
approximation: (55) gives n+,debye = 1.0370.

we now switch on the interaction between instantons and anti-instantons putting 1 > 0.
again we can only determine a kind of stable density n+(), if we allow for a defect param-
eter. tab. 2 shows the results for n+() for three dierent values of  as a function of 1.
in case of 1 = 0 we can compare the density to the one in tab. 1, both are results of inde-
pendent simulations. a comparison of the upper line in tab. 2 with corresponding entries
in tab. 1 gives an idea of the statistical error; it is not enormous, but certainly not negligible.

we observe that the density rises only slowly with 1. this is in agreement with the results
of the debye-huckel approximation, which also predicts a slow rising of the density with 1.
for nc = 2, the equilibrium density is given by (see eq. (55)):

n+ =

f (1) = (1 + 1)

.

(61)

the function f (1) varies between 1 and 2 for 1 varying between 0 and 1. for the real cp 1
model, when  = 1, we can expect at least a behavior linear in ln f (1) for the logarithm
of the density ln n+. fig. 7 shows, indeed, that we can obtain a good linear t, using this
assumption. the numerical results for the linear t can be read o from tab. 3. the growth
of the intercept a when 2 goes to zero reects the fact that in this theory the density is
divergent. the growth of the slope b is also natural, since at   0 we expect b = 1 from
eq. (61). in general one sees that the eect of the instantonanti-instanton coupling on the
density is comparatively small as predicted also by the debye-huckel approximation.

finally, let us discuss the running of the instantonanti-instanton coupling 1. from its
derivation in sec. 3.2 it is seen that 1 = /g2 ( at nc = 2) is related to the bare coupling
constant of the theory g2. however, physical quantities cannot depend on the bare couplings,
but only on the renormalized ones. it means that by considering quantum corrections to the
classical instantonanti-instanton interactions one would be able to observe that the bare
coupling constant g2 (or 1) is replaced by the running coupling depending on the charac-
teristic scale in the problem at hand. in our case the only dimensional scale is the average

17

separation between instantons and anti-instantons or, else, the density of zindons, n. from
renormalization-group arguments one can write the 1-loop formula

1 =

1

2 (cid:18)ln

n

l2 + c(cid:19) ,

(62)

however, the constant c remains unknown. in order to determine c one has to perform the
renormalization of the instantonanti-instantons interaction with a very high precision; this
has not been done.

keeping in mind that the dependence of the instanton density on 1 is very mild in the
whole range 0 < 1 < 1 (see fig. 7 and tab. 2) and that the dependence of 1 on the density
is also quite weak (see (62)), and given the theoretical uncertainty in the constant c, we
cannot reliably determine the density self-consistently by taking into account the running
of 1.
in the case of nc = 2 by far a more important factor aecting the density is the
necessary ultraviolet cuto .

6.2 the case nc = 3, 4

in the case nc = 3, 4 we are not plagued with the necessity to introduce a regulator. however,
we are confronted now with enormous uctuations. in fig. 8 the free energy is plotted for
several values of 1. already in the free energy the uctuations are of an order of magnitude,
so that a reasonable determination of the equilibrium density is not possible. however, we
could at least try to compare the situation to the one in the debye-huckel approximation
for nc = 3, 4. first of all it is necessary to mention that our partition function (37) is not
based on two-body interactions only, and is therefore not directly comparable to the one used
to derive the density (55). but, as we will see now, some of the features are nevertheless
strikingly in parallel. first of all it turns out that for all values of 1 not too close to the
critical value, the free energy does not change much (as compared to the extremely large
uctuations). this is in parallel to the fact that the equilibrium density given by the debye-
huckel approximation grows only slowly with 1, see fig. 9. another feature of the debye-
huckel result for the equilibrium density is that it is comparatively large for nc = 2 and then
falls rapidly to the asymptotic value n+(nc = ,  = 1, 1 = 0) = 1/7 exp(2e/7)  1.3888.
the second point, where there is something in parallel between the debye-huckel result and
the simulations, concerns the critical behavior. the debye-huckel formula for the density
becomes meaningless when 1  nc/2(nc  1). hence for nc = 3 we nd crit = 3/4 and for
nc = 4 we nd crit = 2/3. in the simulations it is seen (fig. 8) that for values of 1  1
the system behaves abnormally and shows clear signs of a collapse.

18

7 size distribution

a very important question is what is the size distribution of instantons in the ensemble.
is the average size hi smaller or larger than the average separation between instantons
hri = n1/2? in the former case one can say that instantons are dilute while in the latter
case one says that instantons melt, so that individual instantons have not much sense.

we are now in a position to study this problem quantitatively. the zindon parametriza-
tion of instantons is an ideal tool for that since it allows for both extreme cases. if zindons
of dierent color are uniformly distributed in space that would mean the instantons melt.
if zindons of nc colors tend to form well-isolated color-neutral clusters, it means instantons
are dilute. the size distribution of instantons has been measured on the lattice for nc = 2
[14] after a cooling procedure has been applied to remove short-range uctuations. (for a
recent comparison of dierent cooling techniques on the cp nc1 model see also [22].) a
very delicate question in connection to this is, how to identify instantons on the lattice.
several procedures are in use [1]. in this paper we want to compare two ways of extracting
the instanton content. the rst one, which we call the geometric method, makes use of
the zindon picture. from the sample of all zindons the color neutral nc-plet which has the
least dispersion about the common center is chosen to be an instanton. then all zindons
belonging to this instanton are removed from the sample, and the procedure is iterated to
nd the next group of zindons that has the smallest dispersion and so on, until the whole
sample is grouped into instantons. the second procedure, which we call the lattice method
as it is more close to the ones used in lattice studies, is looking for local maxima of the
topological charge density q(x) on a ngrid  ngrid lattice. an instanton is assumed if a grid
point has a larger topological charge than its surrounding 8 nearest neighbors. in order to
improve the accuracy in nding the center points and the sizes, we construct an interpolating
polynomial,

q(x, y) = ax2y2 + bx2y + cxy2 + dx2 + ey2 + f xy + gx + hy + j,

(63)

calculated from the 9 grid points consisting of the grid point under consideration and its 8
neighbors. from this interpolating function we nd coordinates of the local extrema xe. an
extremum is accepted if it lies inside the 3  3 grid used for the interpolation. in order to
classify whether we have found a local maximum, minimum or a saddle point we construct
the matrix of second derivatives at the extremum xe:

if the two eigenvalues 1 and 2 of this matrix have a dierent sign then xe is a saddle
point and is rejected. for negative 1 and 2 we have a local maximum and respectively a
local minimum if both 1 and 2 are positive. the two eigenvalues give at the same time a

i = q8/|2i|, i = 1, 2 (they should coincide for an ideal spherically-
measure for the size 2
symmetric instanton). this size can be compared to the one derived from the value of the
topological charge at the maximum 2
3 = 2/|2q(xe)|. only if all three sizes are smaller
than l/2 is the instantons or anti-instanton accepted and the size is then taken to be the
geometrical mean of the three denitions,  = (123)1/3. it should be noted that usually
1,2,3 are not drastically dierent. we should also stress that a reliable identication of all
local extrema is achieved only with a ne grid. with a 100100 grid we nd almost the
same number of maxima (instantons) and minima (anti-instantons) as we put in by hands
by xing the number of zindons and anti-zindons.

we rst test both methods, the geometric and the lattice, in a toy model where the
positions of zindons and anti-zindons are random: the interactions are switched o com-
pletely ( = 0 and 1 = 0) so that the distribution of zindons in space is given by a

at measure q d2aaiq d2baj. we generate congurations of zindons with this measure and

compute the topological charge density q(x) of a given conguration from the integrand of
eq. (14). instantons and anti-instantons are then identied by the two methods described
above. taking many congurations we compute the distribution of the instanton sizes, see
fig. 10.

for the at measure the small- side of the distribution can be immediatelly evaluated
from dimensions to be ()  2nc3. the geometric distribution (shown by histograms)
follows this prediction whereas the lattice method strongly deviates from it. [one can mimic
the smooth geometric distribution by the lattice method by taking a crude grid but then
many instantons are lost as they fall through the grid.] the fact is that the topological
density computed from randomly distributed zindons shows many sharp and narrow peaks.
the larger number of instantons we take (at xed density) the more sharp the peaks become:
it clearly indicates a non-thermodynamic behavior of the system.

this pathological behavior is due to the utmost instability of the product ansatz (13) in the
case when the interactions are swithched o. indeed, the sizes of instantons are determined
by eq. (18) where the role of the weights ca is played by long products (19). these products
are extremely unstable: sucient to change the positions of very distant zindons, and cas
will change. with zindons distributed according to the at measure cas uctuate by orders
of magnitude, and the more zindons are taken the stronger they uctuate. it means that
there will always be a zindon of a certain color whose weight ca is much much larger than
those of the other zindons forming an instanton. according to eqs.(17, 18) the extremum of
the topological density will then coincide with the position of the zindon of that particular
color, and the size of the corresponding instanton will be close to zero. this is why we see
too many small-size instantons by the lattice method. see also the discussion around fig. 12
below.

20

when we switch on the interactions zindons get correlated and the product ansatz should
not be pathological any more. in particular, from the experience of the debyehuckel ap-
proximation we know that the correlation functions of zindons get exponentially suppressed
at large separations. therefore, we expect that the topological density will not have un-
physical sharp peaks at small  as in the case of the at measure, and the two methods of
instanton identication should come closer. in practice, however, one cannot be sure before-
hand that the thermodynamic equilibrium is fully reached, given the limited computer time
for conguration generation.

we switch on the interactions, rst, only of zindons belonging to same-kind instantons
(1 = 0) and then adding interactions between instantons and anti-instantons (1 = 0.5),
see fig. 11. we show only the cases nc = 3, 4 as for nc = 2 the size distribution is cuto
dependent. for the lattice method we use again the 100  100 grid. unfortunately, the
uctuations of the partition function in the simulations are so large that we have to apply a
trick in order to get meaningful results. we let the metropolis algorithm work until a plateau
is reached. then we make many measurements of the size distribution at the plateau, all
weighted with a weight averaged over the plateau. we repeat this for several starts but we
essentially see the size distribution for the plateau possessing the largest free energy.

the price we have to pay for this somewhat truncated simulation is that the unphysical
peaks at small , as determined from the lattice method, are still present though they are
not so awkward as in the non-interacting case. as nc increases the small- peak shrinks,
therefore one can speculate that at large nc it is easier to reach the thermodynamic equilib-
rium. except for very small  the two methods of instanton identication seem to produce
rather similar distributions.

the geometric size distribution exhibits the expected behavior at all . in particular, at
small  it behaves as ()  b3 where b = nc is the 1-loop gell-mannlow coecient,
which is to be expected from dimensional analysis.

we observe that the instantonanti-instanton interaction does not inuence the size dis-
tributions signicantly. this is seen both from geometric and lattice methods by comparing
curves in fig. 11 with 1 = 0 and 1 = 0.5. the case 1 = 0.5 has a slightly broader
distribution. qualitatively, it should be anticipated since the interactions between zindons
and anti-zindons tend to pull out individual zindons out of their neutral clusters, however,
the eect is small.

as to the interactions of the same-kind zindons, it clearly leads to smaller instanton sizes; this
could be also anticipated. indeed, the zindon interactions are such that same-color zindons
are repulsive while dierent-color zindons are, on the average, attractive. such interactions
lead to preferred clustering of zindons into color-neutral groups. (this is especially clear

21

for nc = 2 where the coulomb interaction leads, as we have seen, to a collapse of zindons
into neutral pairs as one removes the ultraviolet cuto,   0).
in fig. 11 we show by
arrows at the top of the plots the positions of the geometric distributions maxima in the
non-interacting case of fig. 10: both for nc = 3 and 4 the maxima are noticeably shifted to
smaller sizes when one switches on the interactions. the lattice method shows this shift
only in the case nc = 4 where the unphysical small-size peaks of the topological density are
suppressed.

in fig. 12 we plot the topological density obtained from a typical conguration of zindons
at nc = 3 with all interactions taken into account. we see that the peaks of the topological
density in general correlate with the positions of the centers of instantons found by the ge-
ometric method (shown by triangles in fig. 12). in some cases, however, the peaks of the
topological charge density sit not in the centers of the 3-plet of zindons forming an instanton
but rather near one of the three zindons. this is the consequence of the instability of the
weight coecients ca, discussed above, and is the actual cause of the small- peaks in the
lattice size distributions.

finally, we would like to draw attention to the fact that in fig. 11 we have plotted the instan-
ton sizes in units of the average separation between instantons, dened as hri = (n/v )1/2.
it is remarkable that both for nc = 3 and 4 and independently of the method used to identify
instantons, the average instanton size is denitely smaller than the average separation. it
means that instantons formed of nc-plets of zindons are, on the average, dilute. though one
can always nd a huge instanton overlapping with many others, the probability of such an
event is relatively low.

8 conclusions

we have formulated the statistical mechanics of instantons and anti-instantons in the d = 2
cp nc1 models in terms of their constituents which we call zindons. we have derived the
interactions of same-kind and opposite-kind zindons for arbitrary nc. at nc = 2 they come
to logarithmic coulomb interactions known previously. at nc > 2 the interactions are of
a many-body type though one can reasonably approximate them by two body logarithmic
interactions with charges depending on the color of zindons.

at high temperatures the system can be studied analytically by ways of the debye-huckel
approximation, at any nc. the physical case corresponds to the temperature  = 1 and can
be studied by a metropolis-type simulation. the numerical study shows that the debye-
huckel approximation is, as expected, accurate at small , but is qualitatively valid even
at  = 1. both analytical an numerical studies indicate that the eect of instantonanti-
instanton interactions (in our language the zindonanti-zindon interactions) is not signicant:

22

the interaction of same-kind zindons or, else, the multi-instanton measure, is by far more
important for the statistical mechanics of the instantonsanti-instanton ensemble.

at nc = 2 the system is, strictly speaking, collapsing into instantons of zero size: to reg-
ularize its behavior one needs to introduce an ultraviolet cuto. we have studied in detail
the statistical mechanics with varying cuto parameter: the numerical simulations are fully
compatible with the expectations.

at nc = 3, 4 the system does thermodynamically exist with no cuto, however, it exhibits
enormous uctuations which undermine accurate measurements of physical quantities. nev-
ertheless, we have managed to study the instanton size distribution introducing two methods
of its determination, geometric and lattice. using the lattice method with a very ne
grid we observe many unphysical small size instantons for nc = 3, which stem from the
instability of the product ansatz. though this eect is believed to disappear when the sys-
tem approaches the true statistical equilibrium it is very dicult to get rid of it in practice
because of gigantic uctuations in the system. the eect is even more pronounced for the
at measure but tends to vanish when nc is increased.

though the zindon parametrization of instantons and of their interactions allows for com-
plete melting of instantons and is quite opposite in spirit to dilute gas ansatze, we observe
that zindons, nevertheless, tend to form color-neutral clusters which can be identied with
well-isolated instantons. this eect is due to a combination of two dierent factors both
supporting clustering. one factor is the interactions: same-color zindons are strongly repul-
sive while dierent-color zindons are attractive. the second factor is pure geometry: even
with a at measure the probability to combine nc zindons into a neutral cluster smaller than
the average separation is quite sizeable. both these factors are expected to be even stronger
in four dimensions appropriate for the yang-mills instantons.

table 1: dependence of the zindon density in the coulomb gas on the cuto parameter.
the error is given by the standard deviation of the n+s obtained by separate ts to ve
measured curves. the value of n+ itself is the value one obtains if one performs a combined
t with one n+ to all the measured curves. the real value of n+, however, is determined by
the error in the defect , to gain experience of its inuence one may compare to tab. 2.

table 2: dependence of the instanton density n+ on the coupling parameter 1. in the table
the density n+ is given for three dierent values of 2 (l = 1). one should note that the
defect  has quite a large error, therefore the resulting values for the density at 1 = 0 are
dierent from the one in tab. 1 due to this statistical error. a is the intercept from the
combined t of the free energy to a form f = a + n[ln(n/l2)  1] + n ln n +  ln n! and
it is a small quantity, which can be neglected in the further discussion.

table 3: fit of the equilibrium density to the form given by the debye-huckel approximation.
the table shows the results for the linear t to the form ln n+ = a + b ln f (1), where
2 [(1 + 1) ln(1 + 1) + (1  1) ln(1  1)]. the increase of the intercept when 2
ln f (1) = 1
becomes smaller is due to the fact the the density for nc = 2 is divergent. all values are for

the gure shows the spatial distribution of zindons for nc = 2 (on the top ), nc = 3
(bottom left) and nc = 4 (bottom right). the lled and empty circles and squares symbolize

is reached. from thin to bold we use the lengths l = 0.5, l = 0.6, l = 0.7, l = 0.8,
and l = 0.9. the smooth solid curves show the combined t with the scaling function
f (l, n) = n[ln(l2)  (ln(n)  1  ln(n+))] + a, with a single a and n+ given to t all ve
curves simultaneously. if we t each curve separately we get from thin to bold the following
values for the density n+ = 62.341, n+ = 64.526, n+ = 66.027, n+ = 63.857, and n+ =
63.836. in case of the combined t we get for the density the value n+,best = 64.117  1.193,
where the error is the standard deviation derived from the ve separate measurements of n+
given above. the cuto parameter in this gure is 2 = 0.001. the defect  is 0.481.

figure 6: check of the debye-huckel approximation to the coulomb gas (nc = 2). the
solid lines from thin to bold give the measured value for a coulomb gas with  = 0.1 and
lengths l = 2, l = 3, l = 4, l = 5, l = 6. the thin smooth solid lines show the prediction
of the scaling law, which is f(n,l) = (2  )n[ln(l2)  (ln(n)  1  ln(n+))] + a, where
n in this case is the number of instantons only, as we do not consider any anti-instantons
here. the four curves yield the value for n+ = 1.06787 0.0024, which is in agreement with
the prediction of the debye-huckel approximation, which gives n+,debye = 1.0370.
