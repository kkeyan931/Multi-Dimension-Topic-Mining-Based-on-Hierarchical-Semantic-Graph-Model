abstract

we present an approach to studying the casimir eects by means of the eective
theory. an essential point of our approach is replacing the mirror separation into the
size of space s1 in the adiabatic approximation.
it is natural to identify the size of
space s1 with the scale factor of the robertson-walker-type metric. this replacement
simplies the construction of a class of eective models to study the casimir eects. to
check the validity of this replacement we construct a model for a scalar eld coupling
to the two-dimensional gravity and calculate the casimir eects by the eective action
for the variable scale factor. our eective action consists of the classical kinetic term of
the mirror separation and the quantum correction derived by the path-integral method.
the quantum correction naturally contains both the casimir energy term and the back-
reaction term of the dynamical casimir eect, the latter of which is expressed by the
conformal anomaly. the resultant eective action describes the dynamical vacuum
pressure, i.e., the dynamical casimir force. we conrm that the force depends on the
relative velocity of the mirrors, and that it is always attractive and stronger than the
static casimir force within the adiabatic approximation.

1 introduction

the casimir eect originally suggested in 1948 has been generally regarded as the contribution
of a nontrivial geometry on the vacuum uctuations of quantum electromagnetic elds [1, 2].
the change in the vacuum uctuations caused by the change of geometry appears as a shift of
the vacuum energy and a resulting vacuum pressure. for a standard example, when we insert
two perfectly conducting parallel plates into the free space r3, the plates are attracted towards
each other [1], although being uncharged. this attractive force is experimentally conrmed
by sparnaay in 1958 [3] and recently more precise measurements have been provided [4].

the dynamical casimir eect suggests that the nonuniform accelerative relative motion
of the boundaries (perfectly conducting plates or mirrors) excites the electromagnetic eld
and promotes virtual photons from the vacuum into real photons [5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. the works
on the dynamical casimir eect are pioneered by moore [5] and have progressed by many
authors [6, 7, 8, 9]. moore studied the quantum theory of a massless scalar eld in the one-
dimensional cavity bounded by moving mirrors, and evaluated the number of photons created
by the exciting eect of the moving mirrors. in his approach, the boundary condition on the
scalar eld is replaced with the simple equation, referred to as the moores equation, which
describes the constraint on the conformal transformation of the coordinate. his approach has
been popularly used to investigate the problems relating to the (1 + 1)-dimensional dynamical
casimir eect. for a well-known example fulling and davies calculated the energy-momentum
tensor with the moores equation, and showed the existence of the radiation from the moving
mirrors [6].

the dynamical casimir eect occurs even in the adiabatic approximation. indeed, we can
hardly handle the congurations except for the adiabatic deformations. here, adiabatic means
the absence of mixings among the dierent energy levels of the system during the modulation
of the mirror separation. in other words the relative velocity of the mirrors is much smaller
than the velocity of light. especially sassaroli et al. succeeded in evaluating the number of
photons produced by the adiabatic motion of the mirrors in 1 + 3 dimensions [7]. they used
the bogolubov transformation among the creation and annihilation operators of photon in
order to describe the particle production.

the similar phenomena of the particle production also have been predicted in a variety
of general-relativistic situations [10, 11, 12]. such phenomena include the hawking radiation
from black holes [11], the domain-wall activity in cosmology, and the high-speed collision of
atomic nuclei [12]. although these phenomena are interesting, the dynamical casimir eect
has not yet been experimentally conrmed.

if moving mirrors create radiation, the mirrors experience a radiation-reaction force. sev-
eral authors have discussed this subject within the adiabatic approximation. dodonov et al.
showed the existence of the additional negative frictional force besides the static casimir force
in the one-dimensional cavity by using moores equation [8].

the advantage of moores approach is the properties: the theory does not need to possess
the hamiltonian or the lagrangian to describe the time evolution of the eld. however, it
seems dicult to apply moores approach to study the casimir eects and its backreaction in
1 + 2 or 1 + 3 dimensions because the boundary condition of the one-dimensional space plays
a crucial role in his approach.

in this paper we present an eective-theoretical approach to studying the casimir eects
in 1 + 1 dimensions. our approach, making use of the action, is considered to be applicable to

2

study the casimir eects and its back reaction also in the higher dimensions. in general the
existence of the moving boundaries (mirrors) makes it dicult to construct the hamiltonian
or the lagrangian describing the system, since the relative motion of the boundaries (mirrors)
mixes one energy level of the system with the others. however, we note that the adiabatic
motion allows us to neglect this boundary eect: we do not need the boundaries. so we
replace the spatial conguration d1 into s1 in the adiabatic approximation. the motion of
the cavity size is described by varying the radius of s1 in time. furthermore, we can naturally
identify the size of space s1 with the scale factor of the robertson-walker-type metric. that
is, the mirror separation is described by the scale factor. the time evolution of the scale
factor can be regarded as the space-time r s1 with gravity. for the sake of the replacement
from d1 into s1, we can study the casimir eects from the viewpoint of the eective theory.
the construction of the model with the replacement is very simple and general, so that it is
easy to apply our approach to more realistic models in the higher dimensions by replacing
the space d1  rn into s1  rn.
to check the validity of our replacement, we construct a scalar model and calculate the
casimir eects. as is usual our model makes use of the conformal symmetry property of
the two-dimensional theory of massless elds. in our model of the cavity-system the classical
action is constructed by the classical kinetic term of the mirror separation and the polyakov
action. the polyakov action describes the massless scalar eld minimally coupling to the
two-dimensional gravity. the classical action is simple and general, so the structure of the
model, e.g., symmetry, is easily visible. we carry out the path integral on the scalar eld,
and obtain the eective action for the mirror separation. the calculation of the path integral
is rather complicated; however, it can be exactly performed. the eective action consists of
the classical kinetic term of the mirror separation and the quantum correction terms. the
quantum correction takes a well-known form, which consists of the static casimir energy term
and the conformal anomaly term. the conformal anomaly term represents the back reaction
of the dynamical casimir eect. the eective action nally leads to the dynamical vacuum
pressure depending on the relative velocity of the mirrors.

our approach also gives an explanation for the origins of the casimir eects in terms of
the eective theory: the casimir eects are caused by the change of eld conguration in the
vacuum instead of the existence of the boundaries.

the paper is organized as follows. in sec. 2 we provide the general description of our
model and the denition of the eective action. in spite of the simplicity of our model, the
calculation of the eective action is rather complicated. we show the calculation in detail
in the following two sections. in sec. 3 the casimir energy is shown to be derived from the
partition function part in the eective action. in sec. 4 the conformal anomaly part in the
eective action is calculated, and obtained the back-reaction term of the dynamical casimir
eect. in sec. 5 the back reaction of both the casimir eects in our model is investigated, and
the dynamical vacuum pressure is derived. section 6 is devoted to conclusions and discussions.
in appendix a the conformal anomaly is induced by means of the fujikawa method [13] and
in appendix b another path-integral calculation on the casimir energy are shown.

2 scalar model for casimir effects

the steps for constructing our model are as follows: for the purpose of describing the casimir
eects in the one-dimensional cavity and the reaction received by the moving mirrors, we

3

consider a massless scalar eld in the one-dimensional nite space with two boundaries, i.e.,
one-dimensional disk d1 [see fig. 1(a)]. that is, we consider the scalar eld between two
moving mirrors. the size of d1 is a dynamical variable, and we assume that the size receives
all the back reaction of the casimir eects.

the motion of the boundaries generally mixes the energy levels of the system. however,
when the motion of the mirror separation is adiabatic, there are no transitions among the
energy levels [7]. because of this absence of the transitions we can neglect the existence of
the boundaries. this implies that each adiabatic hamiltonian in the space d1 is the same
as that in the space s1 except for the overall factor. we replace the spatial conguration d1
with s1 in the adiabatic approximation [see fig. 1(b)]. in the space s1 the scalar eld is
required to satisfy the periodic boundary condition rather than the xed boundary condition.
accordingly the energy levels of the adiabatic oscillation modes in the replaced system are
two times as those in the original system. we can naturally regard the size of s1 as the scale
factor of the robertson-walker-type metric. we dene the robertson-walker-type metric on
the space-time r  s1:

ds2 = dt2 + d2(t)dx2

(0  x  a),

(1)

where a dimensional constant a is the standard space size and the scale factor d(t) is the
dimensionless magnication rate. it should be noticed that the mirror separation is replaced
with the scale factor of the metric.

adiabatically equivalent for the scalar eld to the geometrical conguration (a). the periodic
boundary condition is imposed on the eld.

with the help of this replacement, the model in the two-dimensional gravity is applicable
to our model. the mirror separation has nite reduced mass m and classically obeys free

motion. then the classical action of our model to describe the system consists of both the
classical kinetic term for the scale factor and the polyakov action,

(3)

the polyakov action is invariant under both the general coordinate transformation and the
weyl transformation. this property is referred to as the conformal symmetry. we can always
rewrite the metric into the conformal at form by the general coordinate transformation:

ds2 = dt2 + d2(t)dx2 = c()(cid:16)d2  dx2(cid:17) = g dxdx,

(4)

where we have introduced a new coordinate  such that d  dt/d(t) and c()  d2[t()].
after performing the weyl transformation g  c1()g, we have the d(t)-independent
at metric,

ds2 = d2 + dx2 =  dxdx.

(5)

this implies that any deformation of the space size does not aect the classical action. but
once we quantize the scalar eld, the conformal anomaly appears in general. the quantum
eects lead to the motion of the scale factor, i.e., the motion of the mirror separation.

we use a path-integral formulation to evaluate the motion of d(t) as the back reaction of
the casimir eects. we use the background eld method, in which the metric is treated as
a classical eld and the scalar eld is quantized. we obtain the eective action for d(t) by
integrating out the scalar eld. the eective action for the metric, se[d], is given by

in order to calculate the eective action for the evolving metric (4), we perform the conformal
transformation on the eective action (8) from the evolving metric (4) to the at metric (5):
g  e2g = c1()g = . by means of the fujikawa method [13] this conformal
transformation picks up the conformal anomaly as a jacobian factor from the path-integral
measure in the eective action (8):

(9)

where the parameter of the conformal transformation (x) is chosen as (x) =  1
2 ln c().
{n(x)} is a complete set which consists of the eigenfunctions of the hamiltonian (see ap-
pendix a). the rst exponential factor in eq. (9) is the conformal anomaly, and the second
factor is the partition function for the free scalar eld in the space s1.

where fbare is a bare euclidean free-energy density for the massless eld. since the integration
over k makes fbare divergent, we introduce mass m of the scalar eld to regularize fbare [14],
then the integrand is changed as

lnhk2 + (2n/a)2i  lnhk2 + (2n/a)2 + m 2i .

by the compactness of the space.

4 conformal anomaly in space-time r s1
in this section the eective action for the metric [g] is derived by evaluating the conformal
anomaly in the space-time r  s1. the conformal anomaly is formally expressed by the rst
exponent in the right-hand side of eq.
(9). this anomaly part appears when the space-
size s1 is varying with time. then the anomaly part is considered to describe the back-
in the euclidean space time with the
reactional terms of the dynamical casimir eect.

the factor j(x)  pn,k n,k(x)n,k(x) in the jacobian (23) has a divergence due to the

innite degrees of freedom of the space-time points. in order to regularize this divergence we
introduce a cuto parameter m and insert the cuto function exp(2

after expanding the integrand in terms of m1, the order m 2 terms in eq.

on the other hand, the well-known polyakov-liouville action [15], which is the conformal
anomaly in the space-time r2, brings the same result as eq. (31), shown as follows. the
polyakov-liouville action is given by the general form:

spl =

the ricci curvature in terms of d(t):

the dynamical casimir force depends on the relative velocity of the mirrors. when the
reduced mass m is much larger than the scales e and 1/d, or equivalently, the velocity d is
regarded as zero, the dynamical casimir force (40) is approximately equal to the static one:

fstatic

here the d2 term in the expansion is known as the negative-frictional-like-force [8]. since

6 conclusion and discussions

in this paper we presented an eective theoretical approach to studying the casimir eects
in 1 + 1-dimensions within the adiabatic approximation. the point of our investigation was
the replacement of the spatial conguration: d1  s1. we constructed the eective action
in our model the
of the scalar eld model, and checked the validity of this replacement.
quantum correction to the classical kinetic term of the mirror separation was calculated by
the path-integral formalism. the resultant quantum correction naturally contains both the
ordinary casimir energy term and the back-reaction term of the dynamical casimir eect.
the semiclassical eective action (37) was constructed of the classical kinetic term of the
mirror separation and these resultant quantum corrections. from the action (37), we have
obtained the dynamical vacuum pressure. the pressure (dynamical casimir force) includes
the back-reactional force of the dynamical casimir eect. the dynamical casimir force was
conrmed to be attractive and always stronger than the static casimir force. the dynamical
casimir force depends on the relative velocity of the mirrors, and it is reduced to the static
one when the velocity goes to zero.

the perturbative expansion of the resultant dynamical casimir force (42) includes the
term for the negative frictional force which agrees with the result of dodonov et al. [8].
although this means that our result is not entirely new, our approach reproduces the reliable
result, thus it can be said that we have presented a unique eective theoretical approach to
the problem.

several easier derivations of the static casimir energy in the hamiltonian formulation are
known, but our method needs a more complex calculation to obtain the casimir energy. our
approach, however, describes both the static and the dynamical casimir eects together, and

11

is applicable to more realistic models in the higher dimensions by replacing the space d1 rn
into s1  rn.
furthermore, the existence of the action makes it easy for us to compare our model
with others. for example, our model has a correspondence to the callan, giddings, harvey,
strominger (cghs) model which describes the two-dimensional dilaton black hole [16]. the
back reaction discussed in this paper is comparable to the back reaction of the hawking
radiation from the cghs black hole [17].
in the cghs model the hawking radiation is
represented by the conformal anomaly in the energy-momentum tensor [16], and the back
reaction of the radiation, which is described by the polyakov-liouville action, appears as the
decrease in the black-hole mass [17]. our classical kinetic term in the semi-classical eective
action (37) corresponds to the kinetic term of the dilaton in the cghs model.

some comments are in order.
the quantum correction (36) does not include the third derivative of the dynamical vari-
able. this looks dierent from the results evaluated by fulling and davies [6]. they cal-
culated the energy-momentum tensor in (1+1)-dimensional system of two relatively moving
mirrors [6] as well as that in (1+1)-dimensional system of a single non-uniformly accelerating
mirror [6, 18]. both energy-momentum tensors include the third derivative of the dynamical
variables. our result for the system of two mirrors does not need to coincide with their result
for the system of a single mirror since the forms of the conformal anomaly for two systems are
dierent. the result for the system of a single mirror is due to the unruh-like eect rather
than due to the dynamical casimir eect. on the other hand, the energy-momentum tensor
derived from eq. (36) coincides with their result for the system of two mirrors under a certain
transformation of the dynamical variable.

in the semiclassical eective action (37), the contribution from the dynamical casimir
eect generated a negative-denite kinetic term of the mirror separation. such a kinetic
term also appeared in the analysis of the cghs model [17]. the following point should
be noted: there is a positive-denite classical kinetic term, and the negative-denite term
gives only a slight correction. this holds in the case where the mass scale of the mirrors
m is much greater than the scale of the casimir energy  d1. on the other hand, if the
mirror separation d(t) is smaller than the inverse of the mirror mass m1, our result (40)
shows that the dynamical casimir force fdyn becomes repulsive. however, our semiclassical
treatment becomes unsuitable at that time. when the motion of the mirror separation obeys
the quantum mechanics, this repulsive force might be realized. we will leave this problem to
subsequent developments.

appendix a: fujikawa method

in this appendix we briey explain the derivation of the expression (9) from the denition of
the eective action (8). this derivation is based on the evaluation of the conformal anomaly
by the fujikawa method [13]. in order to perform the path integration of eq. (8), we make a
wick rotation by introducing an imaginary time variable x2  i. then the euclidean metric
corresponding to the minkowski one (4) becomes

the euclidean eective action is

ds2 = (x2) [(dx1)2 + (dx2)2].

ee [g ] = z d exp(cid:20)

by introducing   4g  and changing the measure d into the invariant form under the
general coordinate transformation d , eq. (a2) becomes

here we have used a notation    1 1 + 2 2. we perform a mode expansion of
the eld (x) in terms of a complete set {n(x)}:

(a5)

where we have chosen n(x) as an eigenfunction of the hamiltonian operator,

here n(x) satises the normalization r d2x m(x) n(x) = mn. now we note that the
measure d  is expressed by the mode coecients an as
d  = yx d (x) = [ dethx|ni ] yn

dan = yn

(a6)

under the weyl transformation g  e2(x)g the mode coecients of the eld (x), an,

are transformed as an innitesimal form,

where the second factor equals to the partition function of the free scalar eld in the at space

wick rotation.

appendix b: another path-integral calculation of the
casimir energy

in this appendix we give another partition-functional derivation of the casimir energy by
means of the point-splitting ansatz and the feynman prescription:
in the path-integral
method the partition function part in (9) can be also evaluated by using the point-splitting
ansatz and the feynmans renormalization prescription. employing the ansatz of point split-
ting to (10),
