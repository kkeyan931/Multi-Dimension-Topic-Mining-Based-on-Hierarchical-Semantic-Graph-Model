abstract

a strict proof of equivalence between dun-kemmer-petiau (dkp) and
klein-gordon (kg) theories is presented for physical s-matrix elements
in the case of charged scalar particles interacting in minimal way with an
external or quantized electromagnetic eld. first, hamiltonian canoni-
cal approach to dkp theory is developed in both component and ma-
trix form. the theory is then quantized through the construction of the
generating functional for green functions (gf) and the physical ma-
trix elements of s-matrix are proved to be relativistic invariants. the
equivalence between both theories is then proved using the connection
between gf and the elements of s-matrix, including the case of only
many photons states, and for more general conditions - so called reduc-
tion formulas of lehmann, symanzik, zimmermann.

introduction

more than 60 years ago g. petiau [1], r dun [2] and n. kemmer [3]
proposed the rst order equation (dkp equation) for descripition of spin
0 and 1 particles. this period of time is conventionally divided in three
periods: the rst one from 1939 until, aproximately 1970; the second from
1970 to 1980 and the last one from1980 on.

during the rst period the majority of the papers about dkp equation
was devoted to the development of dkp formalism and to the investigation
of dkp charged particles interaction with eletromagnetic eld (em eld).
for many classes of processes (such as qe of spin 0 mesons, meso-atom and

others) calculations based on dkp and kg equations yield identical results
[5], including one-loop corrections [4, 5, 6]1.

a very important contribution to the understanding of this question was
made by a. wightman in his paper [10] devoted to the 70th birthday of
p. a. m. dirac in 1971. he showed that, for minimal coupling with em
eld ( ea) in dkp theory, one has stability of dkp equation for
spin-0 particle under smooth local pertubation of external eld or, express-
ing in another way, that the retarded character of dkp equation solutions
is conserved under such pertubation as well as in dirac equation without
anomalous magnetic moment.

the instability of such sort has been discussed by g. velo and d. zwanziger

in [11], where they showed that it destroys causality in rarita-swinger equa-
tion for spin 3/2 particles (in external eld).

the central point of the proof by a. wightman is: the retarded character
of solution is connected with the renormalizability of the theory in the case
of interaction with a quantized em eld.

the second period can be characterized as by some disappointments
and hesitations. by this time two great discoveries had been made: parity
violation and creation of unied theory of eletro-weak interaction (weinberg-
salam theory or standard model). the question about the equivalence of
both dkp and kg theories arises again at the attempts to describe new
processes. many works (see references in [8]) have been made applying
dkp formalism to decays of k and other unstable mesons and to strong
interaction. the conclusion presented in reference [8] was not optimistic:
dkp formalism in some cases yield dierent results from a second order
formalism2.

the third period goes under the sign of uncertainness: are both dkp
and kg equivalent or not? not so many papers have been published on this
theme. in our opinion one of main reasons for the decrease of interest in
dkp formalism in the last period is the conclusion about nonequivalence
between dkp and kg theories3.

we believe that the equivalence between these theories in the case of
nonstable particles can be proved as well as for all processes which are

1a rich list of references with historical comments can be found in reference [8]. unfor-
tunately in this work there are no references to the works by i. gelfand and a. yaglom,
who obtained the rst order equation for particles with xed arbitrary spin. for references
to these and others works see [9].

2moreover, in work [12] it is armed that dkp theory gives for k meson decay qual-

itatively dierent results when compared to kg-formalism

described by renormalizable theories. this question, however, goes beyond
the scope of this paper.

as we know there are no strict proof of the equivalence between dkp and
kg theories in quantum electrodynamics of spin 0 particles, too. coinci-
dent results have been obtained for many processes in rst order pertubation
theory, one loop corrections and the infrared approximation [5, 6, 7].

the main goal of this paper is to give a strict proof of the equivalence
of dkp and kg theories for charged scalar particles interacting with an
external or quantized em eld in minimal way for physical matrix elements
in any order of pertubation theory.

in section 2 hamiltonian canonical approach to dkp theory is developed
in component and matrix forms. the construction of generating functional
of green function (gf) of dkp theory is used for quantization of the theory
and the physical matrix elements of s-matrix are proved to be relativistic
invariants.

in section 3 the equivalence of dkp and kg theories is proved for phys-
ical matrix elements utilizing the connection between gf and the elements
of s-matrix, including the case of only many photons states. in section 4 the
equivalence of both theories is shown in the more general framework con-
dition - so called reduction formulas of lehmann, symanzik, zimmermann
[13].

in section 5 we shortly discuss the basic results and questions about

construction of renormalizable dkp theory for spin 0 particles.

the appendix contains some proofs.

2 canonical quantization

2.1 hamiltonian approach in component form

our aim is to construct the hamiltonian for dkp theory which is one with
constraints due to degeneration of  matrices rst we will work in component
representation. the lagrangian density is

l =  (id  m) 

(1)

where d =   iea;  = 
; g = diag {1,1,1,1}. primarily
one considers a as an external em eld. we choose the  matrices in the

following form:

 = (cid:0), 0, 1, 2, 3(cid:1) .

in component form l is then equal to

l = d + d  m ( + )
from equation (4) one nds all the 1st stage constraints:

p =

p0 =

now we construct the initial hamiltonian h:

h =z d3xnpa

.
a

lo = z d3x(cid:8)ii  ii + m ( + )

+ie (a  a)}

(8)

here pa = {p, p, p0, p0, pi, pi } and we used equations (5) to (7).
from equations (5) to (7) we get the 1st stage constraints4:

 = p  0,  = p, 0 = p0 + , 0 = p0

4we follow terminology of the book [14].

(9)

i = pi, i = pi .

5

(10)

thus one can speak that the initial h is the hamiltonian on the con-

straint surface:

it is easy to check that the poisson brackets for constraints a are5:

.
a

h =z d3xnpa

loa=0
{, 0} = 1; {, 0} = 1.

.

(11)

(12)

(14)

(15)

(16)

(17)

(18)

(19)

all others brackets equal zero. constraints (9) are second-class con-

straints6 as they do not disappear on the constraint surface  = 0.

from equation (12) it follows that

rank ka, bk = 4.

(13)

this means that if we introduce new hamiltonian o constraint surface

for denition lagrangian multipliers a

h (1)

2 = h +z d3xa (x) a (x) ,

and demanding that all constraints conserve in time

a

.


=na, h (1)

2 o = 0,

we can not dene all a, but only , , 0, 0.

six constraints from (15) give the six 2nd stage ones that are:

.

i = ni, h (1)
i = ni , h (1)

2 o = {i, h} = 
2 o = 

h



.

i = di  mi  2

.

i = di   mi  2

including all constraints (ten 1st stage and six 2nd stage) in total system,

where now

we can check that

i , 2

i (cid:9) ,

rankka, bk = 16

5all variables: pa, a depend on x.therefore the r.h.s. of equation (12) is  (x  y)

which we omited.

6for simplicity we will not use the dirac brackets.

and

det ka, bk = 1.

6

(20)

all these constraints are second class ones. according to the general

scheme [14] we can nd all a from the conditions:

.

a=na, h (1)

2 o = 0.

from equations (9), (10), (14), (17), (18), and (21) one gets:

 = m0 + iea0;  = m0  iea0;

(21)

(22)

0 = 

1

m(cid:0)didi + m2(cid:1)+ie0a0; 0 = 
di (m0 + iea0) ; i = 

1
m

i = 

1
m

1

m(cid:0)di di + m2(cid:1)ie0a0;

(23)

di (m0 + iea0) .

(24)

equation (24) is a consequence of conservation of the 2nd stage con-

straints:

2
i 

.

i=ni, h (1)

2 o = 0; 2

i 

.



i =ni, h (1)
2 o .

the main criterium of the correctness of the canonical or h-approach to
the l-theory is the coincidence of the lagrangian and hamiltonian equations
of motion.
to get h-equations of motion we must introduce solutions (22) to (24)

(25)

in equation (14) and to consider the following equations:

.

2 o =z d3y { (x) , a (y) a (y)}

 = n (x) , h (1)
= z d3y (y) { (x) ,  (y)} =  (x) = m0 + iea0

or

and analogously

d0  m0 = 0,

conservation of constraint i;

d0  m0 = 0.
i=ni, h (1)

.

2 o = 0; gives:

di  mi = 0; di  mi = 0.

(26)

(27)

(28)

(29)

collecting equations (27), (28) and (29) one gives

d  m = 0; d  m = 0.

consider

7

(30)

.

0 (x) = n0, h (1)
= 0 (x) = 
= 
= (cid:0)dii + m(cid:1) + ie0a0

2 o =z d3y0 (y) {0 (x) , 0 (y)} =
m(cid:0)didi + m2(cid:1) + ie0a0 =
di (di + mi) (cid:0)dii + m(cid:1) + ie0a0 =

1
m

being the rst term equal to zero due to equation (29). or

d + m = 0.

(31)

we obtain all l-equations, which follow from equation (4).
thus we get by canonical way, from equations (30) and (31), on the

classical level, the kg equation for -eld:

dd + m = 0.

(32)

obviously, this result follows in a very simple way from component form

of l, equations (4), too.

2.2 quantization. generating functional

for canonical quantization of the theory with second class constraints7 [14,
15] one chooses the new canonical variables:

(i) = , (2) = p; (1) =  = 0  p, (2) = 0 = p0; (1)
0 =  = p; (2)
0 = , (2)
(i)

0 = p; (1) = 0 =  + p0, (2)

,

i = (2)
i = (2)

i = i 
i = i 

,

= i = pi
= i = pi

7quantization of theories with the 2nd

class constraints devouted many papers, be-

ginning with classical work of dirac [15], see also [16, 17].

here we have four physical variables, (k) and (k)

, k = 1, 2, and six-
a = 0, which allow to express the rest variables through

0

teen constraints (k)
(k), (k)
0 .

now the rules of quantization are very simple [14, 15]:

(cid:20) 



p (y)(cid:21) = i{ (x) , p (y)} = i (x  y)

the dierence between h-quantization of dkp-theory and formal l-
quantization consists in appearance in equation (37) of two functional -
functions, which reect the existence of the 2nd stage constraints (16) and
(17) in h- approach to dkp theory.

after integration in equation (37) over a and utilizing the -function

we get:

z(cid:0)j ,j ,j,j (cid:1) = exp(cid:26)iz d4xd4y (mj  (x) g (x, y) j (y)

is the gf of the scalar charged eld  in external em eld.

generating functional gf in kg theory.

if one formally makes j = j  = 0 we obtain from equation (38) the
in the general case, as it will be shown bellow (see equation (51)), the
generating functional (38) exactly coincides with that calculated in matrix
form, where

0 ,j 1,j 2,j 3(cid:1) ; i =(cid:0)j ,j0,j 1,j 2,j 3(cid:1) .

i =(cid:0)j ,j 0
we want stress that det (cid:0)dd + m2(cid:1)1does not appear in equation

(38), see point 2 after equation (52).

2.3 h-approach. matrix form

starting from equation (1) we can dene the momenta

= z d3x(cid:16)ikdk + m  e0a0(cid:17)
= z d3x(cid:16)ikk + m  ea(cid:17) , k = 1, 2, 3

this is exactly equation (8), if we write equation (43) in component

form.

here we write down all the 1st stage and the 2st stage constraints and

lagrangian multipliers in matrix form, omitting calculations:

- 1st stage constraints

- 2nd stage constraints

(48)

all these , expressed through the components coincide with the

corresponding a in equations (22) to (24).

2.4 quantization. generating functional.matrix form

as well as in component form in equation (35) we get, for generating func-
tional in external em eld, the following expression:

z(cid:16)i, i(cid:17) = z1

0 z dd(cid:16)(cid:16)1  (0)2(cid:17)(cid:16)ikdk  m(cid:17) (cid:17)

 exp(cid:26)iz d4x(cid:16) (id  m) + i  + i(cid:17)(cid:27) (49)

introducing the auxiliary elds c and c instead functional  function

in equation (49) we get

z(cid:16)i, i(cid:17) = z1

0 z dddcd c  exp(cid:26)iz d4x(cid:0) (id  m) 
+ c(cid:16)1  (0)2(cid:17) (id  m) 
(cid:16)id + m(cid:17)(cid:16)1  (0)2(cid:17) c+ i  + i(cid:17)o ,

(50)

where one used that 0(cid:16)1  (0)2(cid:17) = 0.

integrating over all elds , , c and c we nally obtain:

z(cid:16)i, i(cid:17) = exp(cid:26)iz d4xd4yi (x) (s (x, y, a)
m(cid:16)1  (0)2(cid:17) 4 (x  y)(cid:19) i (y)(cid:27) ,

(51)

where we have introduced the total gf of dk particle in external em eld
a:

s (x, y, a) = (id  m)1 4 (x  y)

(52)

one can make some important comments about expression (52).
1) if one writes down equation (52) in component form we get equation

(38).

2) when we integrate over , , c and c divergences appear and innite
expression for det (id  m)1. all this multipliers also arise in z0 and
disappear from the nal equation (51) .
3) nonrelativistic invariant term (cid:16)1  (0)2(cid:17) in equation (51) arises

at excluding nonphysical component , due to the second stage constraints
(2

in equations (16) and (17)).

we will show that this term (which does not depend on charge) does not
contribute to physical matrix elements of s-matrix.(see appendix, point 1).
4)if one generalizes equations (49) to (52) to the case of interaction of
dk particles with quantized em elds we get the following expression for

generating functional for all gf of the theory (in -gauge):

z(cid:16)i, i,j(cid:17) = z1

here we insert in denominator and in z0 innit constant (det s (x, x, 0))1.
as it is well known, the term  t r ln s (x, x, a) in equation (53) is respon-
sible for appearance of all vacuum polarizations diagrams (see section 3).

3 equivalence matrix elements of s-matrix for phys-

ical states in dkp and kg theories

1) from the beginning we write down the physical operators solution of dk
equation for free particle; which will be needed for the proof of equivalence
of the both theories.

this solution can be written in the following form (see [4])

and a+ = (a), b = (b+).

2) now we write the general connection between gf and matrix elements

of s-matrix for physical states in dkp theory.

by denition n-particles gf of dkp-particles without external photons

states equal, from equation (52), to

gn (x1, ..., xn; y1, ..., yn) = (1)n

2n lnz(cid:16)i, i,j = 0(cid:17)
 i (x1) ... i (xn) i (y1) ...i (yn)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)i,i=0

(61)

= h0| t  (x1) ... (xn)  (y1) ... (yn) |0i ,

where we omit nonconnected gf.

on the other hand, gf (61) can be (formally) expressed through matrix

element of s-matrix in the following way:

gn (x1, ..., xn; y1, ..., yn) =

where s (x  y) is the total one particle gf and the so-called n func-
tions which are equal, in momentum representation, to sn (p1, ..., pn; q1, ..., qn),
n-particles matrix element of s-matrix for physical states on the mass-shell

n (p1, ..., pn; q1, ..., qn) = sn (p1, ..., pn; q1, ..., qn)

pi0 =(cid:16)(pi)2 + m2(cid:17)1/2

; qi0 =(cid:16)(qi)2 + m2(cid:17)1/2

i=1z dxidyis(cid:0)xi  xi(cid:1)
n (x1, ..., xn; y1, ..., yn) s(cid:0)yi  yi(cid:1) (62)

npi=1

;

14

it is well known that one particle gf after renormalization has a pole

 (m bp  i)1 with residue equal to one and 4 (x  y) pecularity (see

equation (51)). thus, if we consider the following physical matrix element

a,b



(pi) pi  m! gn (p1, ..., pn; q1, ..., qn) qi  m! a,b (qi) ,

a  lim

nyi=1

pi0((pi)2+m2)1/2
qi0((qi)2+m2)1/2

(64)
and use equation (63) we get n-particle matrix element of s-matrix for
physical states on mass-shell8

i =(cid:16)(pi)2 + m2(cid:17)1/2

and q0

i =(cid:16)(qi)2 + m2(cid:17)1/2

.

in appendix, point 1, we show that all terms in s (x  y)  4 (x  y)(cid:16)1  (0)2(cid:17)

do not contribute to matrix elements on mass-shell .

the same situation arises if one considers matrix elements for physical

states with many photons in the presence of dkp-particles.

thus one goes to a very important conclusion: we can start from l-
formulation of dkp-theory forgetting about constraints and to consider
instead equation (53) the following expression for generating functional:

z(cid:16)i, i,j(cid:17) = z1

0 z ddda exp(cid:26)iz d4x(cid:0) (id  m) 
(a)2 + i+ i  + ja(cid:19)(cid:27) (66)

and to get for physical matrix element of s-matrix the correct expression.
expressed in another way we can use equation (91) for s-matrix with
relativistic invariant denition of t-product of operators  (x) and  (y) in
interaction representation [5, 6]:

h0| t  (x)  (y)|0i =

p(cid:18)p +m(cid:19)

p2  m2 + i  1

(67)

8for simplicity we do not write down symmetrized expressions for all matrix elements

due to identity of particles.

3) we prove equality between equation (64) and corresponding matrix

element s-matrix in kg- theory.

starting from denition (61) for gf in dkp-theory one write equation

  (cid:19)(cid:21) (70)

(69)

as ipeipx = 

z eipxd4x

in the appendix one shows that the second term in equation (70) is
equal to zero and thus physical matrix elements of scattering scalar charged
particles coincide in dkp and kg theories9.

now we will prove the equality in both theories of many photons gf.
it is easy to show that generating functional of gf in kg theory has the

form:

9the case of scattering charged particles by external em eld is a particular one and

the equivalence of the both theories follows the general formula (97) in appendix.

where gf g (x, y, a) is dened in equation (39).

to get the generating functional of gf only for photons we have to put
j  = j = 0 in equation (71) and i =i= 0 in equation (53). equality of
these equations will be established if we prove that

16

s (x, y, 0)

on the other hand

where

za = z1
z0 =z dd exp(cid:26)iz d4x(cid:18)i  m(cid:19) (cid:27) .
0 z dddd exp(cid:26)iz d4x(d  d

in component form expression (73) equals to:

after integration over  and  we get

4 reduction formulas in dkp formalism and e-

quivalence with the kg theory

one writes down yang-feldman equations for heisenberg operators in dkp
formalism.

 (x) = in (x) +z sr (x  y) j (y) d4y

 (x) = out (x) +z sa (x  y) j (y) d4y

here in (x) and out (x) satisfy the free dkp equation:

(i  m) in,out (x) = 0

sr,a are the retarded and advanced gf of the free equation

17

(78)

sr,a is not equal to zero in up and down light cones. from equations

(77) to (81) we obtain:

(i  m)  (x) = j (x) .

(82)

choosing for in,out (in,out) two linearly independent solutions (54) and

(55) we can write (we omit index x and equation for in,out)

in,out =

1

(2)3/2z d3pnain,out (p) eipxa (p) + b+

in,out (p) eipxb (p)o(83)

analagously we can use equations (59) and (60) to express ain,out (p)

and bin,out (p) through the scalar product

ain,out (p) =z d3xa (x) 0in,out (x) ,

and so on. by denition

aout = sains.

(84)

(85)

we also can dene hisenberg operators of creation and annihilation

a (p, x0) =z d3xa (x) 0 (x) ,
b+ (p, x0) =z d3xb (x) 0 (x) ,

and others; where  (x) is the solution of equation (82).

(86)

(87)

18

now it is possible to prove [13], starting from equations (77), (78), (86)
and (87), that operators a (p, x0) and b (p, x0) have the limits (in weak
sense) for any matrix elements over total system physical states, |nini |mouti,
(88)

x0 hmout| a (p, x0)|nini = hmout| aout,in |nini ,

and analogously for b (p, x0).

for simplicity we carry out the proof of equivalence for matrix elements
of scattering scalar particle (with positive charge from arbitrary initial state
|nini to nal one hmout|. using equation (88) we have

(89)

we get the equation (68).

if we utilize the lsz method for all particles states in |nini and hmout|
further, the proof of equivalence between dkp and kg goes in the same

way as in the end of section 3 (see equations (70) to (75) and appendix).

5 conclusions

1) starting from canonical approach to dkp theory interacting with quan-
tized em eld and constructing the generating functional for gf of the the-
ory we strictly proved total equivalence between physical matrix elements of
s-matrix in dkp and kg theories and between many photons gf in both
theories.

the proof of equivalence between both theories have been carried out
utilizing the more general approach of lehmann, symanzik and zimmer-
mann by reduction formalism.

19

we also proved the equivalence of the both theories, starting from la-
grangian approach to generating functional in dkp theory(see equation
(66)) and forgetting about constraints.

2) in principle, the dkp as well as kg theories are nonrenormalizable
ones even for scalar particles due to the logarithmical divergence of one loop
diagrams of scattering two particles with exchange of two photons [5].

as it is well known that kg theory becomes renormalizable if we intro-
duce a self interaction term   ()2. this problem can be solved in dkp
theory in the same way: it is necessary to add to l in equation (1) terms
(90)

=  ()2 ,

(cid:0)p (cid:1)2

where p =
pseudoscalar .

()2 is the projector on the scalar part of -function; p is

3) in the framework the same method (sections 3,4) formally it is possible
to prove equivalence between dkp and proca equation for spin one particles,
distructing from nonrenormalizability of these theories.

4) we would like to stress that dkp theory until now did not nd wilder
application although this theory has some advantages just due to the de-
genaration of  matrices (one very simple to calculate trace that of) and
due to minimal character of interaction with em elds. one compares ex-
pressions for s-matrix in both theories:

(91)

(92)

sdkp = t exp(cid:26)iz ead4x(cid:27)

skg = t exp(cid:26)iz ie (    ea) ad4x(cid:27)

in the last case the interaction contains proportional terms to e and e2 .
due to this in higher (two and more loops) approximations combinatorial
coecients given to order e2 before having a complicated form.

5) about equivalence of dkp and kg for descripition of unstable par-
ticles we would like to note that if we can apply conception of asymptotic
states to some such particle and utilize for physical matrix elements of s-
matrix the same method which have been used in sections 3 and 4, then
the proof of equivalence is obvious: for instance, for decay of kl mesons
we can calculate the imaginary part of the gf of kl meson and get
equivalence with exactness redening the  component of dkp  function:
ikg = dkp /m, see equation (70).

6 appendix

1) one proves that all terms (cid:16)1  (0)2(cid:17) 4 (x  y) in gf of scalar parti-

cles, equation (53), do not contribute to physical matrix elements (see phrase
after equation (65)). first, consider the simplest case: gf in external em
eld a, which is equal

variance and microcausality for physical observable values.

can contain quasilocal one is equal zero.
