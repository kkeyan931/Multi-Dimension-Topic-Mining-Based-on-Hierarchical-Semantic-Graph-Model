(february 19, 2014)

the weak-eld expansion of the charged fermion propagator under a uniform magnetic eld

is studied. starting from schwingers proper-time representation, we express the charged fermion

propagator as an innite series corresponding to dierent landau levels. this innite series is then

reorganized according to the powers of the external eld strength b. for illustration, we apply this

expansion to the scattering     which involves charged fermions in the internal loop. the

leading magnetic-eld eect to the above process is computed. other applications of this expansion

are also discussed.

i. introduction

particle reactions taking place in the early universe or astrophysical environments are often aected by the back-

ground magnetic eld or the excitations in the medium [1]. a typical example is the modication of neutrino index

of refraction in the early universe or the supernova [2]. there one needs to compute the neutrino self-energy in the

medium or the background electromagnetic eld or both. the neutrino index of refraction is then extracted from the

modied dispersion relation of the neutrino. another example is the plasmon decay     [1] where the decaying
photon acquires an eective mass through the eects of the medium or the background magnetic eld. with such

an eective mass, the above decay is kinematically permissible. furthermore, the behaviors of electron propagators

occurring in the internal loop of the above decay are also aected by the medium or the magnetic-eld. this also

leads to a modication to the plasmon decay amplitude. finally, a more recent example is the enhancement of

neutrino-photon scatterings due to the background magnetic eld [3]. at the lowest order in the weak interaction, it

is known that the amplitude for     is proportional to the neutrino mass [4]. hence the resulting scattering cross
section is rather suppressed. on the other hand, the presence of the background magnetic eld alters the structures of

internal electron propagators, such that     is non-vanishing at o(gf ) even in the massless limit of neutrinos.

specically, the     cross section is enhanced by a factor (mw /me)4(b/bc)2 due to a background magnetic eld
b [3], where mw and me are the masses of w boson and electron respectively; bc  m2
e/e is the critical magnetic
eld.

in the above processes, the relevant magnetic-eld strengths are often smaller than the critical value bc. therefore

it is appropriate to expand the decay width, cross section or other physical quantities in powers of b/bc. in the

literature, such an expansion is usually performed after the relevant amplitude is obtained [5]. for a more complicated

process, it is not always convenient to do so since the amplitude to be expanded may be very cumbersome. in this

article, we shall propose a more straightforward weak-eld expansion, which is performed directly on the charged

fermion propagator participating in the process. with the charged fermion propagators expanded, the physical

amplitude can be easily expressed in powers of b/bc. to perform such an expansion on propagators, we shall begin

with schwingers proper-time representation for a charged fermion propagator under a uniform background magnetic

eld [6]. it is useful to realize that schwingers representation can be recast into a series expansion in terms of landau

levels [7]. in the weak eld limit b  bc, we shall demonstrate that one can reorganize the innite series in powers
of the eld strength b. this is the expansion we are after.

this article is organized as follows: in sec. ii, we will review schwingers derivation of charged fermion propagator

in a homogeneous background magnetic eld. since the convention used by schwinger diers from the currently

popular convention, we shall repeat some relevant details of the derivation for clarication. we shall also illustrate

how to rewrite schwingers result as an innite series where each term is associated with specic landau levels [7]. in

the weak-eld limit, we shall demonstrate how to rearrange the above series in powers of the magnetic-eld strength b.

finally, some technical issues relevant to the phase factor in schwingers proper-time representation will be discussed

in this section. in sec. iii, we apply the weak-eld expansion technique to the process     in a homogeneous
background magnetic eld. as mentioned before, the presence of background magnetic eld signicantly enhances the

cross section of this process. however, the previous work on this process [3] assumes the low energy limit e  me,
besides the weak eld condition b  bc. hence the scattering amplitude of     can be inferred from the
eective lagrangian of     in the vacuum [8]. for general incident photon energies, the eective-lagrangian
approach is no longer appropriate. on the other hand, our approach is valid for any incident photon energies below

the gauge boson mass mw . in the low energy limit e  me, our result agrees with that of ref. [3]. section iv is
the conclusion.

ii. charged-fermion propagator in a homogeneous background magnetic field.

a. the exact propagator solution

the greens function g(x, x) of the dirac eld in the presence of a gauge eld a satises the following equation

(i 6  + e 6a  m) g(x, x) = (x  x),

(1)

where (x  x) is the diracs delta function and m stands for the mass of the dirac eld. we will follow the
technique employed in schwingers paper [6] which regards g(x, x) as the matrix element of an operator g, namely

g(x, x) = hx|g|xi. therefore, eq. (1) may be written as

(6   m) g = 1,

with  = p + ea denoting the conjugated momentum, which obeys the following commutation relations

[, x ] = ig,

[,  ] = ief ,

(2)

(3)

(4)

with f  a  a denoting the eld-strength tensors of the gauge eld. eq. (2) can be formally solved by
writing

g =

1

6   m

= iz 

0

ds (6  + m) exp[i(m2  6 2)s].

this integral representation for g implies that

g(x, x) = iz 
where u (s) = eihs with h  (6)2 = 2  1

2 e f . we observe that u (s) can be viewed as the unitary

where s is the proper time variable. one can now rewrite g(x, x) as

|x(s)i = u (s)|x(0)i,

g(x, x) = iz 

0

dseim2s [hx(0)|(s)|x(s)i + mhx(0)|x(s)i] ,

(7)

(8)

where we have assumed (s) operates on |x(s)i and (0) operates on |x(0)i. we note that the operators x and
 satisfy

ds

= i [x, h] = 2,
= i [, h] = 2ef,

(9)

for a constant eld strength f . in the matrix notation, we may write dx/ds = 2, and d/ds = 2ef . further-
more the transformation function hx(0)|x(s)i can be characterized by the following equations:

ishx(0)|x(s)i = hx(0)|h|x(s)i,

(i + ea(x)) hx(0)|x(s)i = hx(0)|(s)|x(s)i,
 + ea(x)(cid:1)hx(0)|x(s)i = hx(0)|(0)|x(s)i,
(cid:0)i

(10)

with the boundary condition: hx(0)|x(s)i  4(x  x) as s  0. to evaluate eq. (8), we rst solve eq. (9) and
obtain

this solution implies

(s) = e2ef s(0),

x(s)  x(0) =(cid:0)1  e2ef s(cid:1) (ef )1 (0).

hx(0)|h|x(s)i =

ef  (x  x)k(x  x)

with this result, one can solve the rst equation in (10), which gives

is a total derivative in the presence of a homogeneous eld if the rst homology group of the space-time m is trivial,

i.e. h1(m ) = 0 [9]. hence the phase factor is independent of the integration path connecting x and x. one can

further show that c(x) = c(x). therefore c(x) or c(x) has to be a constant independent of x and x. this

constant can be determined by applying the boundary condition hx(s)|x(0)i  4(x  x) as s  0. one obtains

we note that, in the limit of extreme eld strength, i.e. b  bc or b  bc, only part of the terms in eq. (39)
are relevant. in the strong eld limit b  bc, only contributions from the lowest landau level n = 0 need to be
kept. for the weak eld limit b  bc, we shall demonstrate that the innite series in eq. (39) may be reorganized
in powers of the magnetic eld b. therefore those terms with lower powers of b are more important in this limit.

the rst term of eq. (46) is just the electron propagator in the vacuum, while the second term is its correction to

c. phase factor

(47)

in this subsection, we discuss how to treat the phase factor (x, x) as dened in eq. (22). first, we note that

(x, x) is reduced to

9

(x, x) = exp(cid:26)iez x

x

da()(cid:27) ,

(48)

if the integration path connecting x and x is a straight line. this choice of integration path is only for convenience

since the integration in eq. (22) is path independent provided that the vector potential a() is non-singular. second,

for a particular type of coulomb gauge:

a0() = 0,

a() =

b
2

(x

2  2, 1  x

1, 0),

the exponent r x

x da() vanishes, hence (x, x) = 1. therefore, by choosing the above coulomb gauge, the phase

factor (x, x) in the electron greens function can be disregarded. such a simplication is, however, no longer valid

for more complicated processes where more than one electron propagators are involved in the process. to illustrate,

let us consider an one-loop triangular diagram composed of three electron propagators. we denote vertices of the

diagram as p , q and r respectively. it is useful to recall that the full phase factor between two points p and q is

(p, q) = exp(iz p

q

dx(cid:20)a(x) +

1
2

f (x  q)(cid:21))

(49)

according to equation (22). here we use p  to denote the coordinate of the point p . similarly q and r denote

coordinates of the points q and r respectively. as discussed before, one can set (p, q) = 1 by choosing the special

gauge

aq(x)  a0(x) + aq(x)

(50)

with a0(x) = b/2  (x2, x1, 0) and aq(x) = b/2  (q2,q1, 0). similarly, one can respectively set (r, p ) and
(q, r) to unity by choosing the gauges

ap (x)  a0(x) + ap (x)
ar(x)  a0(x) + ar(x),

(51)

with ap (x) = b/2 (p2,p1, 0) and ar(x) = b/2 (r2,r1, 0) respectively. apparently, aq(x), ap (x), and ar(x)
are distinct from one another. hence they cannot be adopted simultaneously to set all phase factors to unity. in other

words, the phase factors shall give rise to a non-trivial contribution to the three-point amplitude. in fact this non-

trivial contribution can be understood in an alternative view. taking eq. (49) as an example, the integrand on the

r.h.s. of the equation can be written as a  a + 1
are all one-form. one can easily show that a is a closed form, i.e.,

2 f x where a  adx, a  adx, and f x  f dx(x q)

10

da = 0.

(52)

note that a is exact if the rst homology group is trivial, namely, h1(m ) = 0. to be more specic, if the gauge
function a(x) is regular everywhere, then the one-form a is also regular. therefore there exists a zero-form  such
that a = d is an exact form. as a result, the line integration which denes (p, q) is path independent. in our
problem, we need to compute the product of three phases: (p, q)  (r, p )  (q, r). it is then important to note
that the one-form a in each of the above phases depends on the boundary point of the path, despite the fact that the
gauge function a(x) is regular. in other words, the gauge of a is chosen dierently in each path, which then gives
rise to a non-trivial phase for a three-point amplitude. precisely one may isolate the boundary dependencies of a by
writing, for example, a = a  f dxq in the case of (p, q). apparently, a is an exact form universal to the
three phases, while f dxq depends on the boundary point q. using this separation, one may rewrite each phase

as

(x, x) = exp(cid:20)iez x
let us denote the rst factor exp(cid:2)ier x

(q, q) = 1, we conclude from eq. (53) that

(54)

this is the nontrivial phase contribution one must attach to the amplitude of a three-point process when we write all

weak eld charged propagator according to eq. (46).

iii.     in a background magnetic field

to illustrate the technique just discussed, we calculate the amplitude of     in a homogeneous magnetic eld
less than bc with e and e larger than m but still considerably smaller than mw . note that we will write the mass

of the electron as m for simplicity from now on. according to the previous discussion, such an amplitude contains

magnetic-eld dependencies in two places: the rst place is in the electron propagator which is aected by the external

magnetic eld, while the second place is in the overall phase which is a function of the eld strength tensor f . the

feynman diagrams contributing to     are depicted in figs. 1(a) and 1(b).

since the scattering energy is much less than the gauge boson masses, we employ the following eective four-fermion

interactions between leptons and neutrinos:

l = 

gf2

(l(1  5)l) (e(gv  ga5)e) ,

(55)

where gv = 1/2 + 2 sin2 w and ga = 1/2 for l = e; gv = 1/2 + 2 sin2 w and ga = 1/2 for l = ,  . we should
remark that the contribution due to ga is proportional to the neutrino mass in the limit of vanishing magnetic eld.

at o(eb) in the limit b  bc, it gives no contribution to the amplitude by the charge conjugation invariance.
therefore we shall neglect the contribution by ga. likewise, we shall also neglect contributions by gv for l = ,  ,

since 1/2 + 2 sin2 w = 0.04  1. using the eective four-fermion interactions, the feynman diagrams displayed in
figs. 1(a) and 1(b) can be simplied into a three point diagram as shown in fig. 2.

to o(eb), the amplitude for     can be written as m  m1 + m2, where m1 arises from inserting the external
magnetic eld to electron propagators according to eq. (46), whereas m2 comes from expanding the overall phase

factor for the three-point function as shown in eq. (54). therefore one has

where gv = 1  (1  4 sin2 w)/2 for e. the rst and second term in gv are the contributions from the w and z
exchanges, respectively. to write down the amplitude m2, we recall eq. (54) which states that the overall phase

factor for     is

(x, y )  (z, x)  (y, z) = exp(cid:20)

(z  x)f (x  y )(cid:21) .

before we proceed to compute m1 and m2, we wish to reiterate the validity of the above expansion. as we have

pointed out in ref. [10] that, by dimensional analysis, any given power of eb in the expansion of m is accompanied

by an equal power of 1/m2 (for m > p) or 1/p2 (for p > m). here p denotes the typical energy scale of external

particles. therefore, both eb/m2 and eb/p2 are much smaller than unity for b  bc  m2/e. now performing the
integration in m1 and m2, we obtain

the numerical result of b has been shown in fig. 2 of ref. [10]. it is instructive to compare our result with that

obtained from the eective-lagrangian approach [3] which will be denoted as 

b. according to ref. [10], we nd

that b and 

b agree reasonably well at a small incoming photon energy (), i.e., /m < 0.5. for  slightly greater

than m, the internal electron could become on shell, and b dominates over 

b due to the rescattering eect by

e+e   . such a dominance lasts till /m = 2.2 where 
that our approach is crucial for the calculation of b(   ) with /m > 0.5.

b begins to overtake b. it is clear from this comparison

since     also contributes to the energy-loss of a magnetized star, it is useful to compute the stellar energy-loss

rate q using the above cross section b. the relation between q and b is given by [11]

q =

2(2)6 z

2d3~k1

e1/t  1z

2d3~k2
e2/t  1

(k1  k2)
12

(1 + 2)b(   ).

(66)

in ref. [3], q is calculated based upon the approximated cross section 

b. such a calculation is repeated in our

earlier work [10] which is based on the cross section b(   ). the temperature dependencies of both qs are
listed in table i of ref. [10]. we found that, for temperatures below 0.01 mev, the eective-lagrangian approach

works very well. on the other hand, this approach becomes rather inaccurate for temperatures greater than 1 mev.

at t = 0.1 mev, our calculation gives an energy-loss rate almost two orders of magnitude greater than the result

from the eective lagrangian. such a behavior can be understood from the energy dependence of the scattering

cross section, as shown in fig. 2 of ref. [10]. it is clear that, for t = 0.1 mev, q must have received signicant

contributions from scatterings with   m. at this energy, the full calculation gives a much larger scattering cross
section than that given by the eective lagrangian. by comparing the predictions of the full calculation and the

eective-lagrangian approach [3], we conclude that the applicability of the latter to the energy-loss rate is quite

restricted. while the eective lagrangian works reasonably well with  < 0.1m , it would give a poor approximation

on q unless t < 0.01m.

16

iv. conclusion

in this paper, we have developed the weak-eld expansion technique for processes occurring in a background

magnetic eld. this expansion is performed with respect to internal electron propagators which are aected by the

background magnetic eld. our approach is particularly useful for those processes which involve external momenta

greater than the electron mass m. in this kinematic regime, the eective-lagrangian approach is no longer appropriate.

to illustrate our technique, we calculated the cross section of     under a background magnetic eld, and
consequently determined the stellar energy-loss rate q due to this process. it is interesting to nd that the eective-

lagrangian approach is inappropriate for computing the stellar energy-loss rate due to    , unless the star
temperature is less than 0.01 m. this result reects clearly the importance of our approach. in fact, our approach can

be applied to many other processes. a prominent example is the photon splitting process    [12,13], which is of
great interest in the physics of neutron stars. to perform analysis of this kind, it is useful to obtain an analytic photon

splitting amplitude for arbitrary photon energies. clearly our technique is suitable for doing just that provided the

magnetic eld in the neutron star is less than bc. works along this direction are currently being pursued.
