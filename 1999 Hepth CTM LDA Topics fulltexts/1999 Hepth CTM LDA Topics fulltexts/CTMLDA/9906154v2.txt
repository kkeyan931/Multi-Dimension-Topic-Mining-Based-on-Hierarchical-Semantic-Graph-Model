abstract

we study 2 + 1 chern-simons gravity at the classical action level.

in

particular we rederive the linear combinations of the standard and exotic

einstein actions, from the (anti)self-duality of the internal lorentzian in-

dices. the relation to a genuine four-dimensional (anti) self-dual topological

theories greatly facilitates the analysis and its relation to hyperbolic three-

dimensional geometry. finally non-abelian vector eld dual action is also

obtained.

i. introduction

2 + 1 general relativity has many remarkable features such as renormalizability, inte-

grability, topological invariance etc., which has been of great value as a heuristic guide in

the quest of the correct theory of the quantum gravitational eld in four dimensions (for a

review, see [1]).

these properties derive from the fact that 2 + 1 einstein gravity can be written as a

chern-simons theory. this formulation is deeply related to the celebrated btz black hole

solution [2] and recently this relation has been of great importance in the further development

of the ads/cft correspondence [3], in particular in the ads3/cft2 correspondence in the

context of string theory [4]. in the ads3 case, in the context of topological eld theories,

this correspondence can be also realized as the well known correspondence between a 2 + 1

chern-simons gravity theory on the bulk three-manifold x and the rational conformal eld

theory wzw2 on the boundary of this bulk (that is the cs3/wzw2 correspondence) [5].

in refs. [6,7] it was found that general relativity in 2 + 1 dimensions with cosmological

constant  is equivalent to a pure chern-simons gauge theory on an arbitrary three-manifold

x and certain gauge group g. x is locally homogeneous with curvature equal to  and

for deniteness we will take it to be given by   r with  a riemann surface. for
 > 0, the gauge group g is the de sitter group so(3, 1); for  < 0, it is the anti-de sitter

group so(2, 2) and for  = 0, it is the poincare group iso(2, 1). thus general relativity

in 2 + 1 dimensions is a topological quantum eld theory of the schwarz type [7]. in ref.

[7] witten showed, for  6= 0, that there are two actions associated to two dierent ways of
parametrizing the invariant quadratic form on the lie algebra of g; namely, the standard

einstein action which characterize classically the chern-simons gravity in 2 + 1 dimensions

and the exotic one. the sum of these two actions gives one more general action, which is

classically equivalent to the standard one, but their quantization is expected to lead to two

dierent quantum theories. topology change of spacetime was subsequently discussed within

this context [8]. some further developments of chern-simons supergravity and extended

2

supergravity were considered in [9]. applications of chern-simons gravity and supergravity

to the two particle scattering problem were studied in [10].

in this paper we will follow the philosophy of macdowell and mansouri (mm) paper [11]

and apply it to the 2+1 chern-simons gravity. within this philosophy, the chern-simons

action depends only on the gauge eld of the group under consideration. with the usual

diagonal cartan group metric, the identication of its components with the spin connection

and the vierbein amounts to the exotic action [7].

this 2 + 1-mm type of action is then naturally generalized by taking its anti-self-dual

part with respect to the internal indices of the gauge eld. the procedure followed is similar

to that in a previous work [12], in which the 3 + 1-mm action was generalized for the

(anti)self-dual gauge eld.

it was shown there that this model is a generalization of the

plebanski-ashtekar dynamical action [13]. chern-simons gravity action for the self-dual

connection was originally considered in [7] and more recently in [14]. in this paper we nd

that the two dierent classical actions, the standard and the exotic one, describing

chern-simons gravity, are encoded in the (anti) self-duality of the internal indices of the

structure group g of the frame bundle. this is not by itself a surprise and it was already

recognized by witten in [7]. however we will apply this result to further explore classical

properties in chern-simons gravity. this self-dual theory corresponds, in 2+1 dimensions,

to both the mm self-dual action [12] and the plebanski-ashtekar formulation [13].

linear combinations of the exotic and the standard actions have been already con-

sidered in the literature [6,7,1517]. however, for this pure topological 2 + 1 chern-simons

theory, these two actions appear together by considering the self-dual action. it has been

previously shown, that for a pure 3+1 topological gravitational model [12,18], the same kind

of procedure gives the sum of the euler characteristic (x) plus i(x), with (x) being

the signature. in a way the euler characteristic seems to play the role of a -term [19]

(being both terms topological one could also see that (x) is a -term), similarly, here the

standard action will plays the role of a -term. in three dimensions all manifolds have

vanishing euler characteristic. it is well known that the precise relation between the classi-

3

cal topological invariants in four dimensional manifolds w and the chern-simons invariant

cs in its non-trivial boundary w = x is through the atiyah-patodi-singer formula [20]

(w ) = zw

p1(w ) + zx

cs + s,

(1)

where p1(w ) is the rst pontrjagin class of w i.e. rw t r(r  r), cs is the chern-simons
action and s is the -invariant of x. the restriction to self-dual (or anti-self-dual) part

of the curvature in w , with respect to the group indices, leads to the atiyah-patodi-singer

formula of the form

(w ) = zw 

p1(w ) + zx

cs + s ,

(2)

where w  denotes the space w with self-dual (or anti-self-dual) curvature tensor. we will

nd in sec. iii that keeping this notion of (anti)self-duality some set of known data nd a

better understanding with these data correlated by this (anti)self-duality.

in previous works [18,21], we were able to exhibit eld theory duality actions, where

the dual action appears with inverted coupling constants (for a recent review of duality in

eld and string theory, see [22]). this was performed for 3 + 1 mm-gravity and supergravity.

for chern-simons gravity as well, a eld theory duality will be found in this paper, in the

sense of rocek and verlinde [24], which also gives for the dual action a sigma-model of the

type of freeman-townsend.

it is known from [7] that some quantum aspects of chern-simons gravity are related to

the mathematical description of hyperbolic geometry of our three-manifold x [2527]. in fact

it was shown in [7] that the volume and chern-simons invariants v and cs, are related to

the standard and exotic actions respectively. however in order to distinguish hyperbolic

three-manifolds x with the same invariants v and cs it is needed a more rened invariant,

the -invariant [28,29]. in the present paper we show that this -invariant is origined, in

the chern-simons gravity theory, from its relation to a self-dual topological gravity theory

in four dimensions. thus all invariants v , cs and  are encoded in a self-dual topological

gravity theory in four dimensions.

4

this work is organized as follows: in section ii we give an overview of 2+1 chern-simons

gravity. in section iii the consideration of the self-dual spin-connection (with respect to the

internal lorentzian indices) leads to the standard and exotic terms, which emerge as

a linear combination. also in this same section the correspondence with some aspects of

hyperbolic geometry is described. a dual theory to chern-simons gravity is presented in

section iv. in section v we nally give our concluding remarks.

ii. overview of 2 + 1 chern-simons gravity

in this section we will briey recall the basic structure of 2 + 1 chern-simons gravity

and the relevant structure of the elds, lagrangians and symmetries which we will need in

the following sections. for a more complete treatment see refs. [1,7]. in particular we will

follow the notation of these references.

in [6,7] it was shown that the 2 + 1 einstein-hilbert action with vanishing cosmological

constant is equivalent to a chern-simons action in 2 + 1 dimensions with gauge group given

by the poincare group iso(2,1). the gauge eld aab

i with a, b = 0, . . . 3, takes values in

the lie algebra of iso(2,1).

in the case of nonvanishing cosmological constant  6= 0, witten found that the natural

generalization is given by the standard einstein action [7]

(3)

this einstein-hilbert action gives rise to two spacetimes, one for  > 0 whose covering

is a portion of the de sitter space with symmetry group so(3,1) and the other one with

 < 0 with symmetry group being so(2,2). there is a more general action which can be

constructed by taking the standard diagonal representation of the invariant quadratic form

of the lie algebra of the gauge group [7]. this action was termed the exotic action and it

is given by

this action has the same classical symmetries as the standard one and for this reason it

can be added to the standard einstein action. in a representation of the lie algebra where

its generators are given by (j +

the decomposition of the connection is associated to the decomposition of the lie algebra of

is given by sl(2, c)  sl(2, c).

under an euclidean continuation to go from minkowski spacetime to the euclidean one,

the standard term is real and the only possible modication (for renormalizing purposes)

is a rescaling of the vierbein by the constant h. moreover, the exotic term should arise

as pure imaginary and the parameter k in its coecient should be quantized. finally it is

worth to mention that one can dene the euclidean partition function [7]

z(x) = z dede i

of the appropriate linear combination of the exotic and standard actions to be

in the limit h  0, z(x) could ow towards a critical point where the

partition function be described by two geometric invariants of the hyperbolic geometry of

three-manifolds: the volume v and the chern-simons invariant cs. these invariants are

described by the standard and the exotic actions respectively [7].

iii. the case of the self-dual spin connection

in this section we will working chern-simons lagrangian for (anti)self-dual gauge con-

nection with respect to duality transformations of the internal indices of gauge group

g = so(3, 1) [7,14]. this action is given by

where a, b, c, d = 0, 1, 2, 3, ab = diag(1, +1, +1, +1) and

aab

(aab

).

(9)

(10)

this last equation satises the relation ab

i = iaab.

we can compute the rst term of the right hand side of the action (9) and this gives

ijkaab

i jakab = ijk(

(11)

while the second part of the action (9) gives

(12)

thus using eqs. (11) and (12), the action (9) can be rewritten as

(15)

up to here we have worked out with the minkowski signature. we can perform a wick

rotation and the self-dual chern-simons action (15) will be modied by a global factor i, so

the above action can be written as

lcs = i  i

i.

2

(16)

this is precisely the relevant linear combination of the standard and exotic actions used

to describe the hyperbolic geometry of x in euclidean geometry through the volume form

v and the chern-simons invariant cs [7,2527]. thus the euclidean partition function of

the self-dual chern-simons action (9) gives straightforward the topological invariant

z(x) = exp(cid:18) v

h  2ikcs(cid:19).

(17)

this invariant provides a more rened invariant than the volume invariant v only and it

has been proved to be a complex analytic function in the space of smooth deformations

in the space of the hyperbolic structures on x [26,27]. however there is another natural

invariant, as we have seen, which is the -invariant which does not enter in the formula (17).

the -invariant is very important and permits to distinguish two hyperbolic three-manifolds

with the same volume v and cs invariants, that is, with the same partition function z(x)

[28]. thus all natural classical invariants v , cs and  are encoded in the pontrjagin term

rw d4xrab

rab for w with non trivial boundary x through the formula (2). thus

the gauge group g is inherited to the three-dimensional gauge theory and the self-duality

used in this section is induced by the genuine self-duality from the theory in four dimensions.

thus the invariant z(x) coming from i and i is not enough and it should be corrected by the

-invariant. notice that this come from the assumption that the three-dimensional theory

come from another theory in four dimensions. the considered gauge groups g give a hint of

it because these groups are more naturally symmetry groups of four-dimensional theories.

there is another phenomenon which can be better understood also with the idea of the

self-duality in the internal indices. euclidean and lorentzian quantum eld theory of the

8

chern-simons gravity lagrangians, l and l diers by a factor i as we have seen above.

from the point of view of the geometry of x the change of the lagrangians are encoded in

a change of the orientation of x. from the pure topological chern-simons gravity point of

view both lagrangians are equivalent because the theory is independent on the metric of

x. this is not satisfactory because both actions amount to very dierent quantum theories.

it nds a nice explanation by the using of the (anti)self-duality inherited by the four-

dimensional theory on w . the reason is as follows: a change of the orientation of the bulk

w i.e. e0  e1  e2  e3  e0  e1  e2  e3 leads to a change of orientation on the boundary
e0  e1  e2  e0  e1  e2, for xed e3. in four dimensions the (anti)self-dual projection
implies the choice of an orientation on w . thus as we have seen this choice is preserved

on the boundary x of w and the choice of l or l corresponds to the choice of lcs in eq.

(9). some other new invariants are indeed necessary in order to describe dierent hyperbolic

three-manifolds with the three classical invariants equal [29]. moreover the description of

these mutant invariants from the chern-simons gravity and supergravity deserves further

research.

iv. chern-simons gravity dual action

this section is devoted to show that a dual action to the chern-simons gravity action

can be constructed following [24]. it is worth to mention that for the abelian case a dual

action to the chern-simons action that does invert the coupling constant was worked out

previously by balachandran et al, in the context of the quantum hall eect theory [30].

before we proceed to show the duality of the chern-simons gravity action under vec-

tor eld transformations we would like to describe our motivation for it. from the linear

combination (8) and eq. (6) one substitutes this later in the former to get

i =  +i +  i

9

(18)

with

 =

1

2h  i

k

16

.

(19)

equation (18) has the typical form of actions transforming under modular transformations

sl(2, z) [19]. clearly the rst term in eq.

(19) is the coupling constant of the gravity

theory while the second term is a kind of -term. thus one can ask whether there exist

some modular transformation which transforms the partition function (7)

z(

a + b
c + d

) = (c + d)u(c + d)vz( ),

(20)

where u and v are the weights of the modular transformation. this would have importance

in the construction of further new invariants in the description of hyperbolic geometry as we

have seen at the end of section iii. in this section we will show that such a transformation

exists but action (18) is in fact self-dual under this sl(2, z) group.

we begin from the original non-abelian chern-simons action given by

l = zx

k
4

tr(a  h),

(21)

where h = da + 2

gauge group g.

3 a  a and tr is a quadratic form in the lie algebra of the relevant
i mabdxi,
in what follows we will use the usual conventions: a = aab
ij mabdxi  dxj, where mab are the generators of the lie algebra
abcd the structure constants of

abcdmef with f ef

 = ab

i mabdxi, g = gab

of g and they satisfy [mab, mcd] = if ef

the lie algebra. the invariant quadratic form on the lie algebra is given by tr(mabmcd) =

(ac bd). with these conventions, the above action is written as

l = zx

ijkaab

fabcdef acd

k (cid:19).

(22)

now, as usual we propose a parent action in order to derive the dual action to (22),

ld = zx

atr(b  h) + btr(a  g) + ctr(b  g)

(23)

where as usual, b and g are lie algebra-valued one and two forms over x and a, b, c are

constants to be determined. in local coordinates on x, the above action can be written as

10

ld = zx

where

d3xijk(cid:18)abab

i hjkab + baab

i gjkab + cbab

i gjkab(cid:19),

hjkab = jakab +

1
3

fabcdef acd

j aef

k

.

(24)

(25)

it is a very easy matter to show that eq. (22) can be derived from the parent action. to

see that, consider rst the partition function of the parent action of the form

z = z dadgdbexp( + ild)

(26)

exp(cid:18) + i ld(cid:19) = z dgdb exp(cid:18) + izx

d3xijk(abab

i hjkab + baab

i gjkab + cbab

i gjkab)(cid:19).

one can integrate out rst with respect g. this gives

exp(cid:18) + i ld(cid:19) = z db(baab

i + cbab

i

)exp(cid:18) + iazx

d3xijkbab

i hjkab(cid:19).

(27)

(28)

integration with respect to b gives the nal form

ld =

a choice of the constants of the form

fabcdef acd

).

(29)

c =

,

a = b = 1

(30)

immediately gives the formula (22).

the dual action ld can be computed as usually in the euclidean partition function,

by integrating rst out with respect to the physical degrees of freedom a

exp(cid:18)  ld(cid:19) = z daexp(cid:18)  ld(cid:19).

(31)

the resulting action is of the gaussian type in the variable a and thus after some computa-

tions it is easy to nd the dual action

the partition function is nally given by

z = z dgdbqdet(m1)exp(  ld).

(33)

in this dual action the g eld is not dynamical and can be integrated, if we take the

values (30) for the constants of the parent action (23), then the integration of these auxiliary

(34)

as balachandran et. al. mention [30], the elds b cannot be rescaled if we impose

periodicity conditions on them, in such a way that this dual action has inverted coupling

with respect to the original one.

v. concluding remarks

in this paper we have rederived linear combinations of the standard and exotic

actions given by witten [7]. an interesting feature is that both actions are encoded in the

self-duality of the gauge group of the the theory for non-vanishing cosmological constant.

thus both actions are obtained from the chern-simons gravity action for the (anti)self-dual

connection (9).

as a matter of fact, we have provided the justication of this derivation by observing that

the linear combinations of the actions i and i come from the (anti)self-duality structure of

the four manifold w when one is restricted to work on the boundary x of w . it leads also

12

naturally to incorporate the -invariant, a necessary invariant of the hyperbolic geometry of

x [28,29].

for the non-abelian chern-simons gravity action we have found a non-abelian dual

action in the sense of [24]. this resulting dual action consists of a sigma model of the

freeman-townsend type eq. (32). moreover one can reduce this action to a chern-simons

action with the inverted couplings eq. (34).

the results obtained in section iii can be easily generalized to chern-simons supergrav-

ity. it is tantalizing to nd the supersymmetric extension of the dual action obtained in

section iv. furthermore it would be of some interest to apply the results of this paper to

explore further uses of chern-simons gravity to hyperbolic geometry of x and perturbative

expansions of chern-simons theory with non-compact groups [31]. work in these directions

will be reported elsewhere.
