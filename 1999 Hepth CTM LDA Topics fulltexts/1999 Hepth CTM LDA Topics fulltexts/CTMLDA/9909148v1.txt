abstract

the radiation emitted by accelerated fundamental strings and d-branes is

studied within the linear approximation to the supergravity limit of string the-

ory. we show that scalar, gauge eld and gravitational radiation is generically

emitted by such branes. in the case where an external scalar eld accelerates

the branes, we derive a larmor-type formula for the emitted scalar radiation

and study the angular distribution of the outgoing energy ux. the classical

radii of the branes are calculated by means of the corresponding thompson

scattering cross sections. within the linear approximation, the interaction of

the external scalar eld with the velocity elds of the branes gives a contri-

bution to the observed gauge eld and gravitational radiation.

1 introduction

in addition to fundamental strings, nonperturbative superstring theory contains
various types of extended bps objects which play a key role in the web of dualities
that have been uncovered in recent years, notably ns solitons [1, 2, 3] and d-
branes [4, 5], which carry r-r charges. the theory also contains non-bps solitonic
states, some of which are stable [6].

among the bps states, the ns 5-branes appear to be rather complicated objects
whose dynamics is poorly understood, mainly because no tractable cft description
is known for them. however, it has been argued that the dynamics of ns 5-branes is
given by a new theory of self-dual closed strings in six dimensions. this formulation
has proved remarkably fruitful in studying the bps spectrum of compactied string
and m theories [7], even though the nature of the posited six-dimensional string
theory without gravity remains somewhat mysterious.

by contrast, d-branes admit a very simple cft description, at least at weak
coupling, as hypersurfaces where open strings can end [4]. this has made it possible
to use world-sheet techniques to study various aspects of the dynamics of non-
relativistic as well as relativistic d-branes, and to perform explicit computations of
scattering amplitudes involving d-branes. this includes processes in which funda-
mental closed strings scatter o a d-brane [8, 9, 10, 11, 12], as well as processes in
which a d-brane scatter o an identical d-brane [13]. furthermore, d-branes have
a number of properties which suggest that they are small at weak string coupling
gs [8, 14]: in string units, their r-r charge is proportional to gs which is small and
their tension is proportional to 1/gs which is small compared to the tension of the ns
solitons (proportional to 1/g2
s). this suggests that, in scattering processes in which
a lower-dimensional d-brane scatter o a higher-dimensional d-brane, the former
can be viewed as a probe of sub-stringy distances in the background geometry of the
latter, and much can be learned about the physics at distances shorter than the ten-
dimensional string and even the planck lengths from this viewpoint [15, 16]. in this
framework, there are two descriptions of the interactions between d-branes: the su-
pergravity interaction mediated by massless closed strings, and the probe quantum
eld theory which gives the eective dynamics of the various open string sectors.
the range of validity of the two descriptions are dierent: supergravity is reliable at
distances large compared to the string scale, while sub-stringy eects are governed
by the light open strings.

however, most studies of string and d-brane scattering generally neglect a num-
ber of dynamical eects such as d-brane recoil and acceleration eects [17, 18, 19].
the latter are also important in the studies of the structure of black holes using

1

strings and d-branes as probes [16]. for example, if the probe is excited, or the
black hole is non-extremal, then supersymmetry is broken and the long range forces
on an originally static probe do not exactly cancel. the resulting probe acceleration
is a  gm where g is the newton constant and m the mass of the black hole. for
a d-brane background, this gives an acceleration a  gs, which is small at weak
string coupling. for an f-string, this gives a  g2
s , which is even smaller. for the
ns 5-brane, the acceleration is of order one.

from the above considerations, it is clear that a better understanding of brane
acceleration eects, which so far seem to have attracted little attention, is required.
the aim of this paper is to start exploring these eects and to compute the radiation
produced by moving branes. this may turn out to be of import to the understanding
of string and m theory dynamics. for example, it was argued in [20] that rigid
fundamental strings can only be accelerated up to a certain value of the acceleration
ac which is of the same order as, and possibly related to, the hagedorn temperature
th of string theory. beyond this value, the accelerated string appears to be unstable.
it would be interesting to investigate whether this observation extends to dynamical
strings and to other objects in string theory.
in particular, this might suggest a
maximal acceleration for the open strings tethered on a d-branec or those making
up the world-volume of a ns 5-brane.

in the absence of a second quantized theory of strings and branes, it is not clear
how acceleration eects should be described in (quantum) string theory. at any rate,
several aspects of the dynamics of accelerated strings and branes can be studied in
the classical supergravity description. in this paper we will focus on radiation eects
from moving branes in the linear approximation to the classical limit of string theory.
the fundamental string solution couples to the metric, the ns-ns antisymmet-
ric 2-form potential and the dilaton and so one expects an accelerated f-string
to produce dilatonic, electric ns-ns antisymmetric tensor eld and gravitational
waves.
in addition to the metric and dilaton elds, d-branes couple to the r-r
gauge elds of the type ii superstrings, so accelerated d-branes can be expected to
emit dilatonic, gravitational and r-r radiation. likewise, we expect accelerated ns
5-branes to emit dilatonic, gravitational and magnetic antisymmetric tensor eld
waves. the (p, q) strings of the type iib theory [21, 22] are expected to emit both
electric ns-ns antisymmetric tensor eld radiation and r-r 2-form gauge eld
radiation in addition to the dilatonic and gravitational radiation. we will be able to
conrm some of these expectations by explicit calculation of the supergravity elds
produced by accelerated strings and d-branes at large distances in the weak eld

cwe would like to thank michael green for suggesting this possibility.

approximation.

we will restrict ourselves to situations in which the accelerated string or brane
can be thought of as a localised source propagating in a background which is a small
deformation of at space-time at weak string coupling. this is possible for f-strings
and d-branes, but not for ns 5-branes.
in the latter case the space-time metric
involves a harmonic function h = 1 + /r2 in the four-dimensional transverse space
with  a constant of order one in string units, and hence space-time is not at at
small gs.

the organization of the paper is as follows. in section 2, we review the system
of coupled supergravity-brane eld equations which we wish to solve in the linear
approximation. we shall consider a weak external scalar eld whose eect is to
accelerate the branes. the solutions for the scalar elds, the p-form gauge eld and
the metric uctuation are studied in sections 3, 4 and 5, respectively. in the case
of the scalar elds, we derive the energy ux of the emitted radiation and study its
angular distribution. we calculate the corresponding thompson scattering cross-
sections and obtain the classical radii of the f-string and dp-branes, in agreement
with expectations from tree level string diagrams. the dierential equations obeyed
by the gauge eld and metric uctuation are discussed. these can in principle be
solved for the radiation elds, although we have not been able to do so explicitly.
this is because the external scalar eld responsible for accelerating the branes in-
teracts with the velocity elds (i. e. those not depending on the brane acceleration),
which gives a contribution to the observed gauge and gravitational radiation elds
that is not negligible within our approximations. we make some comments about
possible extensions of the present work in the nal section.

2 coupled supergravity-brane field equations

the eective action for string theory in the presence of a p-brane in the long wave-
length limit has the general form

s = sbulk + sbrane ,

(2.1)

where sbulk is the appropriate supergravity action and sbrane is the eective action
for the dynamics of the world-volume elds on the brane. in the following sections,
we will consider the eld equations derived from the bosonic part of the eective ac-
tion (2.1) which describe the long-range bosonic elds outside a fundamental string
or a dp-brane source. at weak string coupling gs, the corresponding background
geometries are nearly at and it is consistent to work in an approximation in which

3

the branes are described by a sharply localised source propagating in a at back-
ground. our strategy will be to study the linearised theory around at minkowski
space-time and to solve for the propagating small uctuations of the ns-ns and (for
the d-branes) the r-r elds.

here we start by writing the bosonic bulk action for a 4-dimensional space-time
obtained by compactication of 10-dimensional space-time on a rectangular 6-torus
t 6 = t p  t (6p): the spatial directions along the p-brane are wrapped around
t p, while (6  p) of the remaining transverse directions are compactied on t (6p).
then we derive the form of the bosonic particle actions arising from the compactied
p-brane actions, and obtain the eld equations of the coupled system. for branes
accelerated by an external scalar eld, we derive the linearised eld equations.

2.1 compactied eective action

for the fundamental string, the non-zero bulk elds correspond to the bosonic sector
of the 3-form version of d = 10, n = 1 supergravity. the string frame action is

sbulk =

1
22

10 z d10xg e210 (cid:18)r + 4(a10)2 

1

2  3!h2(cid:19) ,

(2.2)

where a, b, ... are ten-dimensional space-time indices and h = db with b the ns-ns
2-form gauge eld. the gravitational coupling 10 is given by 22
s 4.
the ten-dimensional dilaton eld 10 has its zero mode substracted.

10 = (2)7g2

for the dp-branes the appropriate bosonic bulk action corresponding to a trun-

cation of the n = 2 supergravities is

sbulk =

1
22

10 z d10xg"e210 (cid:16)r + 4(a10)2(cid:17) 

1

2  (p + 2)!f 2

p+2# ,

(2.3)

where fp+2 = dap+1 and ap+1 is the (p + 1)-form r-r gauge eld. for p = 3,
the eld equations of the action (2.3) must be supplemented with the self-duality
condition f5 = f5, and for p > 3 we consider the eld strength fp+2 dual to f8p.
we shall be interested in the overall motion of a wrapped brane in the uncom-
pactied 4-dimensional space-time. in other words, we assume that the brane does
not oscillate in the internal directions, and we neglect all of its worldvolume dynam-
ics (except for a special case described below). thus, we consider the situation in
which the brane looks like a particle in the 4-dimensional space-time. it would be
interesting to extend our analysis to the case of dynamical extended branes in ten
uncompactied dimensions, including the world-volume excitations. we take y a()

4

as the ten-dimensional target space coordinates and work in the static gauge

y  = y ( ) ,
y m = const. ,
y m = m(9p) ,

 = 0, 1, 2, 3 ,
m = 4, ..., 9  p ,
m = 10  p, ..., 9 ,

(2.4)

where  are the worldvolume coordinates with , , ... = 0, ..., p. we neglect all the
ka luza-klein modes in the compact and transverse directions x m. in the case of a
compactied dp-brane, our discussion includes the possibility of a world-line u(1)
gauge eld a = a( ) with an almost constant eld strength f = da. such a gauge
eld corresponds to a slowly time-varying electric eld e =  a on the particle
world-line. the t-dual system is a d-brane moving with velocity v = e. thus,
we can set a = 0 without restricting the generality: a t-duality transformation on
the solution describing a particle in nearly uniform motion with velocity v yields
the case of a slowly varying electric eld e = v.

with the above assumptions it is consistent to compactify the ten-dimensional

space-time to 4 dimensions using the following truncation

h = fdx  dx  dx9

or f = fm1...mpdx  dx  dxm1  ...  dxmp ,

(2.5)
where g = det(g mn)  det(gmn) = e2(6p)+2p. the eld  is the dilaton eld of
the compactied theory and ds4 is the line element in the einstein frame. the bulk
actions (2.2) and (2.3) reduce to

c(1) = 2 ,

(2.7)

see e. g. [23] for a discussion of the reduction.

in the case of the fundamental string (p = 1), the action (2.6) admits the solu-

tion [24]

transverse compactied space. the fundamental string tension is tf = (2)1.
for the dp-branes the solution takes the form [25]

next we consider the action for the brane source. in the case of the fundamental

string, we start with the bosonic action

sf =

2 z d2(cid:16)y ay bgab + y ay bbab(cid:17) .

(2.12)

with the ansatze (2.4) and (2.5) this action yields the following particle action:

s = m z d (cid:20) 1

2 (cid:16)e2u u g + e2(cid:17) + u c(cid:21) ,

where dc = f and we have dened the transverse 4-velocity vector

in the case of a dp-brane, we start with the eective action

where g, b and a1...p+1 are the pull-backs to the worldvolume of the ten-
dimensional bulk elds gab, bab and aa1...ap+1, respectively. note that the expansion
of the dirac-born-infeld part of the action around at space is of second order in
b. thus, in the linearised approximation considered in this paper we can set this

6

eld to zero. also, as explained above, we can set f = 0. the dirac-born-infeld
part of the action becomes

s = tpz dp+1 e10rdet(cid:16) g(cid:17)

= 

tp

2 z dp+1 e10(cid:16)y ay bgab  (p  1)(cid:17) .

(2.16)

note that, in the eective action (2.15), we have not included the generalized wess-
zumino coupling of the form a expf [26, 27]. this is consistent with our assump-
tions. for example, in the case of a time-varying electric eld we should consider
terms of the form f ap1, and the dp-brane would emit ap1 gauge eld radiation.
also, we have neglected certain anomalous couplings [28] and curvature terms [29]
which will play no role in the analysis of the present paper. with the ansatze (2.4)
and (2.5) we obtain the following particle action for the wrapped dp-brane

2.3 accelerated branes

for small string coupling (and r large enough), the supergravity solutions (2.8)
and (2.10) can be written as an expansion in (2m) around at space. then, we
may regard the branes as delta-function sources localised at r = 0.
in order to
accelerate the branes we further consider some weak external eld. for simplicity
we consider an external scalar eld and to be denite we restrict ourselves to the
scalar eld . if 0(x) is the external accelerating eld we write

(x)  0(x) + (x) ,

8

(2.28)

where 0(x) admits some fourier decomposition 0(x) = r d4k0(k)eikx and the

eld (x) represents the scalar eld generated by the brane source.

to leading order in the external eld 0(x) the equation of motion for the f-string

is

(2.29)
where u  du/d is the 4-acceleration. for the dp-brane, the corresponding equa-
tion is

u  + 0 = 0 ,

u  +

p
2

(u u  0 + 0) = 0 .

(2.30)

in both cases, taking the scalar product of the 4-velocity with the corresponding
equation of motion, we conclude that u  0 = 0. thus, (2.29) simplies to

u  +

p
2

0 = 0 .

(2.31)

also, note that the acceleration is of rst order in 0, i.e.
relativistic limit the equations of motion for the f-string and dp-brane become

in the non-

u  0.

v + 0 = 0

and

v +

p
2

0 = 0 ,

(2.32)

respectively.

2.4 linearised field equations

since the elds generated by the brane source can be written as an expansion in
(2m), we shall work to rst order in this expansion parameter and keep only the
terms linear in such elds. also, we assume that the external eld 0(x) is weak and
keep only the terms linear in this accelerating eld.

in the case of the f-string, the linearised eld equations for the scalar elds take

the form

2 =

1
2

2m z d (4)(x  y ( )) ,

2 = 2m z d (cid:16)1 + 20(y ( ))(cid:17) (4)(x  y ( )) ,

(2.33)

2 = 0 .

9

in the case of the dp-brane we nd

2 =

0(y ( ))(cid:19) (4)(x  y ( )) .

(2.34)

the linearised gauge eld equation for both the f-string and the dp-brane is

given by

(cid:16)(cid:16)1  c(p)0 (x)(cid:17) f (cid:17) = 22m z d u ( )(4)(x  y ( )) .

(2.35)

finally, we give the eld equations for the metric uctuations. in the case of the

f-string, we nd

2h = 22m z d u ( )u ( )(4)(x  y ( ))

(2.36)

2p(cid:16)2(0)  0  (cid:17) ,

where the metric was split as g =  + h and the denition h  h  1
with h  h

2h
 was introduced. the tensor h is taken to satisfy the gauge condition

in the case of the dp-brane, the corresponding equation is

h = 0.

2h = 22m z d u ( )u ( )(cid:18)1 
2p(cid:16)2(0)  0  (cid:17) ,

p
2

0(y ( ))(cid:19) (4)(x  y ( ))

(2.37)

(2.38)

to understand physically the various terms in the above equations, consider
equation (2.38). the rst line on the right hand side has two parts: the factor of
1 inside the bracket gives a source term for the brane, while the factor involving
0(y ( )) governs the scattering of the external eld by the brane source, i.e. the
absorption of closed strings with the quantum numbers of the eld 0(x) and the
emission of closed strings with those of the graviton. the second line on the right
hand side of (2.38) governs the interaction of the external eld 0(x) with the eld
 generated by the brane source, which results in the emission of gravitons.

3 scalar radiation from accelerated branes

in this section we study the scalar eld radiation emitted by accelerated branes.
there are three dierent scalar elds, namely the dilaton  and the compactica-
tion scalars  and . for the sake of brevity, we will only consider the scalar eld ;
similar results hold for the other scalars. the results obtained below are generaliza-
tions of standard results in classical electrodynamics; for a more detailed discussion,
see e.g. [30], in particular chapter 14. we start by nding a solution to the eld
equation for the scalar eld . next we compute the energy ux of the emitted
radiation and study its angular dependence. this result is used to calculate the
thompson scattering cross sections for the scalar , from which the classical radii
of the branes are deduced.

the retarded solution to the linearised eld equations (2.33) and (2.34) for the

scalar (x) can be written in the integral form

(x) = z ddxdr(x  x)j(x) ,

where dr(x  x) is the retarded green function,

notice that we assume the incident beam 0(x) to be well localised such that it does
not mix with the emitted radiation far from the source (otherwise there would be
terms proportional to ()(0) in the poynting vector).

to calculate the poynting vector we have to compute the derivatives with respect
to the observation coordinates x  (t, x) of the retarded quantity (3.5). in doing so
it is important to realize that functions of the proper time  depend implicitly on x
through the relation (3.6) [31]. for a general function f (x,  ) we have

3.3 thompson scattering

the previous results can be used to calculate the cross section for the emission of
waves of the scalar eld  (as well as radiation of  and  waves).
in the non-
relativistic limit the brane motion has the same frequency as the incident radiation
and the process can be described as scattering of the incident radiation. for non-
relativistic motion, the instantaneous power per unit of solid angle radiated by the
brane is

forward and the intensity reaches a maximum for a particular value of the angle,
max. in the direction perpendicular to v (cos  = 0), no radiation is observed.

in the long wave-length approximation, we can assume that the brane moves a
negligible part of a wave-length during one oscillation and therefore the time average
of | v|2 is 1

this result is in agreement with expectations from consideration of tree level string

corresponding to a sphere with four vertex operator insertions. in the case of the
dp-brane, the amplitude is proportional to (2m)  gs, corresponding to a disk
with two vertex operator insertions in the interior.

in order to solve this coupled equation, we split the gauge eld as c  = c 
where c 
in the gauge

(0) does not depend explicitly on 0 and c

where the ellipsis refers to velocity terms that are linear in 0 but fall o as 1/r2 and
to acceleration terms that fall o as 1/r but are quadratic in 0. since 0  u = 0
we conclude that the contribution to the observed radiation of the second term on
the right hand side of (4.8) is negligible. thus, within our approximations equation

the velocity elds in c

the energy ux at innity is not negligible. from equation (4.11), we conclude that
2c 
(1)  0/r. thus the radiation gauge eld
has two dierent contributions. the rst one, described by (4.4) and (4.5), corre-
sponds to the usual result in electrodynamics. the second one, can be obtained by
solving the dierential equations (4.2) and (4.11) and corresponds to the interaction
of the external eld with the velocity elds in f 
(0) . this additional contribution to
the radiation elds stems from the non-linearity of the original system of coupled
eld equations: for example, unlike in electrodynamics, an external electromagnetic
wave interacts with the bulk scalar, gauge and graviton elds of the source; this
gives a contribution to the scalar, gauge eld and gravitational radiation emitted.

although we were not able to nd a solution of the equations (4.2) and (4.11) in
closed form, it is clear that these equations can be integrated. the solution should
then be substituted in the stress-energy tensor for the gauge eld given in eq. (2.26).
the computations of the corresponding poynting vector, of the dierential and total
power radiated and of the thomson scattering cross section are then similar to those
given in section 3, albeit more tedious.

5 gravitational radiation from accelerated branes

in this section we study the solution for the metric uctuations. the linearised
equation for h in the case of the f-string was derived in section 2, with the result

2h = 22m z d u ( )u ( )(4)(x  y ( ))

(5.1)

2p(cid:16)2(0)  0  (cid:17) .
in the case of the dp-branes, there is an extra term of  p
2 0(y ( )) multiplying the
delta-function source; this we can ignore for reasons explained in section 3 when
studying scalar eld radiation. as in the case of the gauge eld, we split the metric
uctuations as h = h

(1) and obtain the equations

(5.3)

within our approximations, the only surviving terms in the equation for h

velocity elds of the scalar . as in the case of the gauge eld, the uctuations h
(1)
are expected to contribute to the observed radiation eld.

to conrm this expectation consider the gauge condition h = 0. for h

this has the correct 1/r fall o behaviour for a rst derivative of the graviton eld
to yield a non-vanishing energy ux at innity. using the equations of motion for
the branes (2.29) and (2.31), we nd that the gauge condition is satised if

(5.5)

18

a hint for the above reasoning comes from consideration of the graviton equations
of motion

2h = 22 (t 

source + t 

 ) .

(5.6)

the conservation equation t  = 0 (which implies that 2h = 0) is a neces-
sary condition for h = 0 and, after some algebra, gives the brane equations of
motion.

to summarise: we found the solution for h

(0) and the dierential equations
obeyed by h
(1), which can be integrated (at least numerically). both terms are
expected to contribute to the observed radiation. to obtain the total radiated
power and other quantities of interest, the solution for the metric uctuations can
be substituted in the formula for the stress-energy tensor of the gravitational eld
around at space, which is well-known in general relativity (see for example [32],
chapter 7 for a discussion).

6 discussion

in this paper, we have considered accelerated wrapped fundamental strings and dp-
branes in the linear approximation to the classical limit of superstring theory. we
showed that such objects generically produce scalar, gauge eld (the appropriate
ns-ns or r-r eld with respect to which the brane is charged) and gravitational
radiation. the eld responsible for the acceleration was taken to be an external
scalar incident on the branes. the space-time in which the branes propagate was
compactied to four dimensions on t pt (6p). we neglected both the ka luza-klein
modes of a string or brane source around t (6p) and the internal excitations of a
p-brane wrapped around t p. it would be interesting to see if the inclusion of these
modes leads to distinctive features of the emitted radiation. alternatively, one can
compactify on t p and obtain results similar to the four dimensional ones considered
here for wrapped p-branes in d = (6  p) space-time dimensions.

in the case of the bulk scalars, we were able to solve the linearised eld equations
and obtained a larmor-type formula for the total radiated power. the angular
distribution of the emitted radiation was studied. finally, the cross section for
scattering of the incident scalar wave was calculated; this gives an estimate for the
classical radii of the branes. in the case of the gauge and gravitational elds, we
were not able to solve the linearised eld equations in closed form because of the
coupling of the accelerating scalar eld to the various elds produced by the moving
source. however, we obtained dierential equations which can be integrated; from
the solutions to these equations, one can in principle derive the total power radiated

19

in the form of gauge eld and gravitational waves and also the cross sections for
scattering of the incident external perturbation.

our results may be viewed as a generalization to string theory and p-branes
(including d-branes) of previous work by cosmologists on radiation from acceler-
ated cosmic strings (for a review and references, see [33]). the approach consists
in solving the eld equations of the maxwell-einstein-higgs system, or a suitable
supergravity generalization thereof, coupled to accelerated localised sources in the
weak eld approximation. the linearization of the eld equations serves two pur-
poses. first, it simplies the otherwise formidable task of solving the system of
coupled partial dierential equations for the scalar, gauge eld, gravitational and
it also allows one to avoid discussing thorny issues
other elds in the problem.
which make their appearance beyond the linear approximation:
for example, the
full einstein equations (2.25) in the presence of a sharply localised source involve
products of -functions which must be dealt with either using the theory of distri-
butions or by attributing a small thickness to the source and taking an appropriate
limit. the weak-eld approximation is certainly valid for sources whose elds fall
o suciently fast in the far away region, where the radiation is observed. the
thin-source approximation is valid in the long wave-length limit of string theory,
but will break down at high energies: there the dynamics is governed by the light
open strings, which determine the eective thickness of the source.

our approach has also neglected a number of dynamical eects which it would be
interesting to include in the analysis. for example, we have not discussed the back-
reaction of the emitted radiation on the source: as energy and momentum are carried
away by the emitted radiation, the solution describing the source and its energy-
momentum tensor will be modied. in addition, the emitted momentum will make
the source recoil and accelerate. these eects should be of import in understanding
the dynamics and fate of strings and branes accelerated in a curved background,
like that of a non-extremal black hole.
in the classical limit we have considered
here, such eects could be studied by viewing the actions (2.12) or (2.15) for the
brane sources as probe actions [16], substituting the pull-backs of the corresponding
space-time metrics and solving the corresponding eld equations in the weak-eld
approximation (which will be valid as long as the probe and the heavy object
responsible for the acceleration are well separated).

it would also be very interesting to understand accelerated branes and radiation
eects from branes in the context of the ads/cft correspondence [34, 35, 36].
in [37], the interactions of probe d3 branes in at and in ads5  s5 backgrounds
in the latter case, the eects of exchange of bulk supergravity
were considered.

20

modes carrying momentum in the brane directions were related to certain terms
involving derivatives of the eld strength in the action of the dual gauge theory.
it is plausible that such terms, along with other higher loop terms in the gauge
theory, correspond to accelerated probes in the curved background. although the
acceleration terms in the gauge theory discussed in [37] correspond in the bulk to
ns-ns and r-r 2-form exchange, there should be additional terms corresponding to
exchange of scalar and gravitational elds. it will be interesting to see whether the
emission of radiation in the bulk can be computed in the gauge theory from these
terms.

another challenge to which our work points is of course to reproduce and obtain
quantum corrections to results such as (3.17) and (3.18) on the radiation emit-
ted by accelerated strings and p-branes directly from the underlying string theory.
with current methods, this appears to be a rather daunting task: even for open
f-strings ending on the d-branes (let alone ns vebranes), the boundary conditions
corresponding to an accelerated brane break the world-sheet conformal invariance.
clearly, some understanding of accelerated open string dynamics at the quantum
level is required.
