abstract

we dene a non-local gauge-invariant greens function which can distinguish be-
tween the symmetric (connement) and broken (higgs) phases of the hot su(2)u(1)
electroweak theory to all orders in the perturbative expansion. it is related to the cou-
pling of the chern-simons number to a massless abelian gauge eld. the result implies
either that there is a way to distinguish between the phases, even though the macro-
scopic thermodynamical properties of the system have been observed to be smoothly
connected, or that the perturbative coleman-hill theorem on which the argument is
based, is circumvented by non-perturbative eects. we point out that this question
could in principle be studied with three-dimensional lattice simulations.

introduction. non-abelian gauge theories based on groups su(n), n  2, with
scalar elds in the fundamental representation have no known gauge-invariant order pa-
rameters that can distinguish between the symmetric (connement) and broken (higgs)
phases [1]. this leads to the conclusion that the connement phase and the higgs phase
can be smoothly connected [2]. in other words, there may be no separate higgs and
connement phases but just one higgs-connement phase. this consideration tells that
nite temperature phase transitions in spontaneously broken gauge theories are not a
generic phenomenon: depending on the parameters of the theory the system may go
through a rst order phase transition (or, in special cases, a second order one), but it
may also be that there is no phase transition at all.

these expectations have been conrmed in lattice monte carlo simulations.

in
particular, no phase transition is observed for suciently large scalar self-coupling for
three-dimensional (3d) theories like su(2) with a doublet of higgses [3]. as 3d theories
can be considered as the eective theories of high temperature four-dimensional (4d)
theories these results mean that there is no nite temperature phase transition in these
systems in some region of the parameter space (for higgs boson masses larger than the
w boson mass).

the behaviour of an abelian gauge theory is dierent. although there is no local
gauge-invariant order parameter that can distinguish between the coulomb and the
higgs phases, there are non-local ones, such as the photon mass. in the higgs phase
the photon mass is non-zero, while in the coulomb phase it is zero, clearly indicating
a dierence between the phases. this statement is correct in all orders of perturbation
theory, and it has also been tested in lattice simulations [4]. there are also other non-
perturbative order parameters in the abelian case, such as the tension of an innitely
long vortex [5].

here we are interested in theories that contain both abelian and non-abelian parts
and contain scalar elds in the fundamental representation. we will deal essentially
with the electroweak theory (or some typical extensions thereof such as the mssm,
with a similar pattern of electroweak symmetry breaking), although the results remain
valid for many models of the type gu(1) where g is a simple group. as in both
previous cases, there are no local gauge-invariant order parameters that can select
the symmetric or the higgs phase. a non-local order parameter associated with the
existence of a massless vector excitation does not distinguish between the phases either,
as the photon in the higgs phase and the hypercharge vector boson in the symmetric
phase remain massless in all orders of perturbation theory (this statement has also
been checked with non-perturbative 3d lattice simulations [6]). the projection of the
massless state to the gauge-invariant abelian hypercharge eld strength was found to
be a smooth function of the temperature at suciently large higgs masses [6], and all
the other observables measured (expectation values of local gauge-invariant operators;
other masses) also behaved smoothly. thus, it seems that the connement and higgs
phases can be smoothly connected also for the su(2)u(1) theory and that there may

1

be no phase transition.

in this paper we dene a non-local greens function which nevertheless jumps when
one goes from the symmetric to the higgs phase independently of the scalar self-coupling
(or the higgs mass) to all orders in perturbation theory. the existence of a massless
vector excitation (or, in other words, the presence of an unbroken abelian gauge sym-
metry) in both phases of the electroweak theory is essential for the argument. there-
fore, one can separate the connement phase from the higgs phase in the su(2)u(1)
gauge theory to all orders in the perturbative expansion. it remains to be seen if this
statement is valid beyond perturbation theory.

phase transition in 3d with a topological mass term. let us consider the 3d
su(2)u(1) theory with a single higgs doublet. this theory is the high temperature
limit for the standard 4d electroweak theory and many of its extensions, obtained
by integrating out fermions, the non-zero matsubara modes of bosons, and the zero
matsubara modes of the temporal components of the gauge elds [7]. below we will
see how the same results can be derived directly in 4d. the 3d action is

let us rst consider a somewhat more complicated theory by adding to eq. (1)

topological mass terms [8] for the u(1) and su(2) elds: s  s + s, where

the theory with a topological mass term for the su(2) eld is mathematically consis-
tent beyond perturbation theory only if 2 is quantized [8], 2 = 0, 1, 2, ..., while
the topological mass for the u(1) eld may be arbitrary. in the following we will nev-
ertheless take 1 = 2 = : it is in this case that we nd a discontinuity computable to
all orders in perturbation theory, and this is also the limit which has an interpretation
in the 4d nite temperature electroweak theory (see below).

consider now the vacuum polarization tensor (the inverse propagator) for the u(1)
eld. in momentum representation, in a general covariant gauge with the gauge pa-
rameter , it is given by

g1

ij (k, ) = (k2ij  kikj)1(k2, ) + iijlkl2(k2, ) + 1kikj,

(5)

2

where

gij(k, ) = z d3x eikxhbi(x)bj(0)i.

(6)

the parity odd part 2(k2, ) is non-vanishing for  6= 0, and gauge-independent. we
will be interested in the limit 2(k2  0, ).

consider rst 2(0, ) in the symmetric phase. at the lowest order of perturbation

theory, it is proportional to the topological mass,

2(0, ) = i

g2
4

.

(7)

however, the theory under consideration satises all the requirements of the coleman-
hill (ch) theorem [9]: there is an unbroken abelian gauge symmetry and no massless
charged excitations (that is, as long as we stay away from the transition point m2
3  0;
the result however does not depend on m2
3). thus, all corrections to 2(0, ) vanish
beyond 1-loop level. consequently, 2(0, ) can be computed exactly at the 1-loop
level. as is easy to understand, there are in fact no 1-loop corrections either, because
on the 1-loop level the vacuum polarization tensor is given by scalar loops which contain
no trace of the topological mass term. thus, in the symmetric phase the relation in
eq. (7) is valid to all orders in perturbation theory.

let us then compute 2(k2, ) (deep) in the higgs phase. we are interested in
the limit k2  0, so that only external lines associated with what would be massless
particles in the absence of the topological mass term are important. we thus concen-
trate on the electromagnetic eld qi =  sina3
i + cosbi where tan = g/g, and
the idea is to apply again the ch theorem, but now for qi. one of the conditions
of the theorem is actually not valid: there is a bilinear mixing between the massive
eld zi = cosa3
i + sinbi and the photon eld qi of the form ijkzijqk. however,
this mixing can be formally removed (i.e., the quadratic part of the lagrangian can be
diagonalized) by a shift of zi: in momentum space,

kikj

(8)

this brings the eective lagrangian in a form consistent with the ch conditions. this
transformation is non-local, but it is infrared insensitive and does not break the u(1)
gauge invariance of qi, and thus does not invalidate the ch-theorem.

3

as a result of writing the action in terms of qi, zi in the higgs phase and making
the transformation in eq. (8), there is a topological mass term for the eld zi, but
none for qi

3. thus, in the vacuum polarization tensor for the massless eld qi,

(9)

at the tree-level. an explicit computation of 1-loop diagrams to order  gives zero for
k2  0 (we have carried out this computation before making the shift in eq. (8)), and
higher order corrections are absent due to the ch theorem. thus, the values of 2(0, )
associated with a massless eld are dierent in the symmetric and higgs phases, and
this is valid in all orders of perturbation theory.

the fact that the ir-sensitive part of the eective action shows such behaviour,
suggests that the partition function of the system (the minimum of the eective action)
may also behave non-analytically at the transition point for  6= 0. in other words,
it is likely that this theory exhibits a genuine rst or second order phase transition
independent of the value of the scalar self-coupling: there are no massless excitations
in the symmetric phase, but there is a massless particle in the higgs phase.

phase transition in 3d without topological mass term. the result obtained
above can be applied to the original 3d theory in eq. (1), without the topological mass
term. note that in perturbation theory, the quantization of  is not essential and the
statement about the absence of higher order corrections to 2(0, ) is valid for real
values of . thus, one can consider the derivative with respect to  of g1
ij (k, ) for
the theory with  6= 0, and then take  = 0. the greens function that results from
this operation is given by

dij(k) = g1

il (k, 0)slm(k)g1

mj(k, 0),

where

sij(k) = z d3xeikxdbi(x)bj(0)(cid:16)n (1)

is a greens function computed in the theory with  = 0 4. the statement is that in
the symmetric phase,

(symmetric phase).

(12)

2(0, )(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)=0

this is valid in all orders of perturbation theory.

3in fact, one does generate a parity-odd term  ijkqijqk proportional to 3k2/m4

z, but this

does not contribute in the limit k2  0 we are interested in.

4to avoid confusion let us note that this greens function is not related to the rate of sphaleron tran-
sitions which was studied numerically in the crossover region in the context of the pure su(2)+higgs
model in [10].

4

in the higgs phase, in contrast, d = 0. as we have argued above, the massless eld
qi does not couple to n (1)
cs in any order of perturbation theory for k2  0, so
that sij(k) in eq. (11) does not have a term behaving as ijlkl/k4. at the same time,
the g1
ij (k, 0) appearing in eq. (10) and dened in eq. (6), still behaves as  k2 for
k2  0. this leads to the vanishing of d in the higgs phase.

cs  n (2)

a subtle point in this argument is that the quantity obtained from eq. (12) is gauge-
invariant only with respect to topologically trivial (small) su(2) gauge transformations.
to make the order parameter completely gauge-invariant one should replace n (2)
cs by
some operator which is completely gauge-invariant but coincides with n (2)
cs in pertur-
bation theory. such an operator can be dened in the 4d theory with chiral fermions,
see below. here we recall a denition within the 3d theory [11, 12] which can be
successfully discretized and implemented in practical lattice simulations [13].

cs  n (2)

the idea is to replace n (2)

cs with the dierence n (2)

cs,cl is gauge-invariant and that n (2)

cs,cl is a partic-
ular integer times 2 depending on the initial eld conguration, with the properties
that n (2)
cs,cl vanishes in case the initial eld
conguration is perturbative (i.e., ga2  a). such a dierence can be obtained
with the following algorithm. suppose we have some (suciently smooth) 3d gauge
eld conguration. introduce a ctitious time variable  and cool the conguration
according to

cs,cl, where n (2)

the su(2) chern-simons number in eq. (11): if the initial conguration is perturbative,
the system should behave essentially as in the abelian case, so that indeed n (2)
cs,cl = 0.
for a completely gauge-invariant measurement one should also replace bi by the hy-
permagnetic eld ijkbjk in eqs. (6), (11)5. note that for the measurement of gij(k, 0),

phase transition in 4d. the consideration above can be carried out also directly in
the nite temperature 4d theory. let us take as an example the standard electroweak
theory, with its real fermionic content. consider the nite temperature (one can also
have a nite chemical potential for conserved charges) greens function dened in

where b + l = r d3xjb+l
is the baryon + lepton number current, generated
by the global transformation i  exp(i)i. we will be interested in the limit k0 =
0, k  0. the part of sij(k) antisymmetric in i, j contains a term linear in k, precisely
as in eq. (12). now, the proof of the ch theorem (the absence of renormalization of the
term linear in k beyond 1-loop level) in fact does not essentially depend on the number
of dimensions (as long as there are no new ir-problems) and is directly applicable
to our case. an explicit 1-loop computation gives a non-zero value in the symmetric
phase since the abelian hypercharge eld contributes to the anomaly in the baryonic
current. at the same time, an explicit computation in the higgs phase gives zero, as
there is no contribution to the baryonic current anomaly coming exclusively from the
electromagnetic eld. this statement does not depend on the mass spectrum of the
theory, nor on whether there is a nite temperature t , or a nite chemical potential ,
with the associated z0, q0-condensate (this does not break the spatial u(1)-invariance).
thus, the object dened in eq. (14) can serve as a distinction between the connement
and higgs phases to all orders in perturbation theory.

in the 4d su(2)u(1) theory without fermions one could use again the chern-simons

number as in eq. (11), instead of the baryon + lepton number.

conclusions. we proposed a gauge-invariant greens function which can distinguish
between the symmetric and higgs phases of the electroweak theory. it is related to
chern-simons number of the gauge elds and has a dierent value in the two phases,
computable to all orders in perturbation theory. the most important ingredients of our
consideration are the existence of an unbroken abelian u(1) group in the symmetric
and higgs phases, the non-trivial photon mixing in the higgs phase, the absence of
massless charged particles, and the use of the coleman-hill theorem.
it remains to
be seen whether the ch theorem is valid beyond perturbation theory in the present
context.

obviously, this consideration does not allow us to x the parameters of the theory
at which the jump of the greens function takes place, precisely as in the consideration
of the photon mass in the case of the abelian higgs model. nevertheless, if non-
perturbative eects were absent, it would tell that there is a non-analytic behaviour
in a certain greens function when one goes from the symmetric to the higgs phase.
this does not as such necessarily mean that the vacuum energy of the 3d theory (or
the partition function of the nite temperature 4d theory) has any singularity at the
point of the transition, since the chern-simons number does not appear as a term in
the lagrangian for  = 0 and serves only as an external probe.

6

there is a physical consequence from this result. suppose that one has a high
temperature system with a non-zero chemical potential b + l for the baryon + lepton
number. this system is unstable as b + l is not conserved due to the anomaly, but
can nevertheless be described on the perturbative level by an eective action of the
type in eqs. (1), (2), with the replacement   ib + l [14]. now, the resulting
system is unstable even perturbatively in the symmetric phase due to the coupling of
the chern-simons number to the massless hypercharge vector eld, which leads to a
spontaneous generation of a hypermagnetic eld [15]. however, in the higgs phase no
magnetic eld is generated perturbatively, due to the absence of a coupling of ncs to
a massless mode, as we have discussed above.
