heat capacity always positive-denite hence sym always unconnement phase {$9703031$}. furthermore so-called localization instability static d3-brane congurations happen {$9705053$}. rotating d3-branes, 2 however, found thermodynamics excitations d3-branes stable critical angular momentum density, beyond heat capacity become negative, phase transition may happen {$9705053$}. localization instability may occur angular momentum reaches critical value {$9705053$}. paper, would like investigate structure thermodynamics multicenter rotating d3-brane congurations using probe method. next section analyze dynamics d3-brane probe multicenter rotating d3- brane background. thermodynamics probe investigated section iii. comparison case single-center solution also made. section iv main results summarized brief discussion. ii. dynamics probe d3-brane multicenter rotating d3-brane background d3-brane solutions type iib supergravity six transverse spatial dimen- sions. therefore rotating d3-brane solutions may three independent angular mo- mentum parameters. simplicity, consider rotating d3-brane solution angular momentum parameter. case, metric 1 ds2 = 1 + dx2 f (cid:16)hdt2 + dx2 + r2(d2 + sin2 d2 + cos2 d2 3)i , 2 + dx2 3(cid:17) +qf " dr2 h 4ml cosh r4f sin2 dtd f = 1 + h = 1 2m sinh2 r4 , 2m r4 , = 1 + l2 1 + r2 1 h = l2 cos2 , = 1 + l2 r2 + 2ml2 sin2 r6f , r2 2m r4 ! . (1) (2) solution dilaton constant nonvanishing components four-form potential c = (f 1 1) sinh dx1 dx2 dx3 (cosh dt l sin2 d). (3) corresponding rotating d3-brane solution, r-symmetry sym theory broken so(6) so(4) u(1). furthermore, observed extremal limit solution, 0 keeping l xed me2 nite, multicenter solution, represents d3-branes distributed uniformly disc radius l {$9703031$}. is, extremal limit superposition n static d3-branes, rather n coinciding rotating d3-branes. taking appropriate coordinate transformation, limiting metric becomes ds2 = h 1/2 0 (dt2 + dx2 1 + dx2 2 + dx2 3) + h 1/2 0 (dy2 1 + dy2 2 + dy2 3 + dy2 4 + dy2 5 + dy2 6), (4) 3 h0 = 1 + 2r4 q(r2 + l2)2 4l22 6, 2 = y2 5 + y2 6, r4 = 4gsn2. four-form potential reduces . (5) r2 = y2 1 + + y2 c = (h 1 0 1)dt dx1 dx2 dx3. (6) hand, dynamics d3-brane probe governed following action: = t3z d4xqdet g t3z c, (7) t3 = 1/2gs(2)2 = n/22r4 d3-brane tension. order investigate dynamics probe, convenient take static gauge: = t, xi act worldvolume coordinates, transverse coordinates yi depend only. lets rst discuss case probe extremal background (4). a. extremal background substituting (4) (6) (7), obtain = t3v3z h 1 0 , (8) overdot denotes derivative respect , v3 spatial volume worldvolume subtracted constant term. static probe, obvious (8) interaction potential vanishes, means source indeed bps conguration. low-velocity probe, action is, term o(v4), = t3v3 2 z y2 + o(v4). (9) seen motion probe like motion test particle mass mp = t3v3 spacetime. therefore, order, motion single-center d-brane background {$9705053$}. course, also required bps property system consisting source probe. consider general motion probe extremal background. generally speaking, motion probe like test particle mass mp moving velocity-dependent potential. set probe angular momentum - = r2 +r2 2. (8) angular momentum y2 direction, write down: l probe, l = mpr2 q1 h0( r2 + r2 2) . (10) energy e probe 4 e = mp( r2 + r2 2) q1 h0( r2 + r2 2) + mph 1 0 . (11) equation, using expression angular momentum kinetic relation, e = 1 2 mp r2 + v (r), obtain eective potential radial motion probe, v (r) = e"1 1 + eh0/2mp (1 + eh0/mp)2# + l2 2mpr2 1 (1 + eh0/mp)2 . (12) (13) thus, radial motion probe test particle mass mp moving velocity-independent central force potential v (r). characterizing motion turning points, satisfy equation e = v (rc). seen clearly eective potential angular momentum vanishes, l = 0, turning point, probe might captured source. mentioned above, source d3-branes distributed disc plane dened y1 = y2 = y3 = y4 = 0. would interesting study motion probe plane orthogonal plane. lets rst discuss case probe moving disc plane. (i).in disc plane. case, one r2 = 2, h0 = 1 + r4 (2 l2)2 , (14) 2 = y2 case, eective potential becomes 5 + y2 6. indeed, harmonic function singular edge disc = l. v () = e 1 1 + e 2mp (cid:16)1 + r4 mp (cid:16)1 + r4 (2l2)2(cid:17)i2 (2l2)2(cid:17) h1 + e + l2 2mp2 1 h1 + e mp (cid:16)1 + r4 (2l2)2(cid:17)i2 . (15) rst consider far region, is, 2 l2 >> r2. potential following behavior: v () e"1 mp(e + 2mp) 2(e + mp)2 + mpe(e + 3mp) 2(e + mp)3 r4 2e2 r4 (2 l2)2# + mpl2 2(e + mp)22 "1 mp(e + mp) (2 l2)2# . (16) force exerted probe mainly comes repulsive centrifugal force due non-zero angular momentum l. eect source sub-leading order. compared single-center case, l = 0, sub-leading eect enhanced due distribution source d3-branes. region near edge disc, namely, 5 2 l2 << r2, constant 1 harmonic function (14) dropped out. eective potential reduces v () = e 1 + l2 2(2l2)2 1 + 4 (cid:16)1 + 4 (2l2)2(cid:17)2 = er4/mp. distance 2 l2 >> 2 , (2l2)2(cid:17)2 , (cid:16)1 + 4 2mp2 (17) 1 introduced characteristic scale 4 eective potential takes following form: v () 3e4 2(2 l2)2 + l2 2mp2 1 24 (2 l2)2! . (18) region, potential sum two repulsive potentials. rst term enhanced due distribution source, usually repulsive centrifugal potential (second term) suppressed. 2 l2 << 2 , v () e e(2 l2)2 24 + l2 2mp2 (2 l2)4 8 . (19) repulsive potential (second term) fact independent energy suppressed case; usually centrifugal potential (third term) becomes attractive also suppressed due distribution eect source. (19) see potential constant e edge disc central force, f () = dv ()/d, probe vanishes there. l2 = 0, turning point 2 c = l2, therefore, probe captured locate c = l; l2 6= 0, turning point c c = 2 / +q(2 /)2 + 4l2 2 , (20) = l2/mpe. therefore conclude motion probe disc plane 2 follows. probe far disc, eect due distribution source sub-leading order. radial motion disc plane, probe captured edge disc angular momentum vanishes; probe bounced back never absorbed source angular momentum vanish. (ii). hyperplane orthogonal disc. probe restricted hyper- plane dened y5 = y6 = 0, orthogonal disc plane discussed above, = 0, h0 = 1 + r4 r2(r2 + l2) , (21) r2 = y2 function. asymptotically far region, eective potential 4. case, r = 0 singular hyperplane harmonic 1 + y2 2 + y2 3 + y2 v (r) e"1 mp(e + 2mp) 2(e + mp)2 + + mpl2 2(e + mp)2r2 "1 r4 r2(r2 + l2)# mpe(e + 3mp) 2(e + mp)3 r4 2e2 r2(r2 + l2)# . mp(e + mp) 6 (22) again, expected, distribution eect source sub-leading order main contribution force probe comes repulsive centrifugal force. unlike case disc plane, however, sub-leading eect suppressed here. region near disc, eective potential following form: v (r) = e 1 1 + (cid:16)1 + 4 4 2r2(r2+l2) r2(r2+l2)(cid:17)2 + l2 2mpr2 1 r2(r2+l2)(cid:17)2 . (cid:16)1 + 4 distance r >> , eective potential takes following form: v (r) 3e4 2r2(r2 + l2) + l2 2mpr2 1 24 r2(r2 + l2)! . (23) (24) rst repulsive potential term suppressed, centrifugal repulsive potential enhanced. r << , eective potential reduces v (r) e er2(r2 + l2) 24 + l2 2mp r2(r2 + l2)2 8 . (25) case, usually centrifugal repulsive potential becomes attractive enhanced, compared single-center case. second term (25) repulsive potential, also enhanced due distribution eect source. (25) see potential constant e r = 0 central force probe vanishes there. therefore probe absorbed r = 0 probe angular momentum. otherwise, probe bounced back turning point: r2 c = 4 l2. 2 (26) b. non-extremal background case, background represents rotating d3-brane solution. substituting (1) (3) (7) yields = t3v3z f 1"qh f 2 1 + f0 f + (1 f )l sin2 sinh # , 2 = r2 h + r2( 2 + sin2 2 + cos2 2 3) 4ml cosh r4f sin2 . f0 = 1 + r4 r4 . 7 (27) (28) (29) case, static interaction potential longer vanish written as: v0(r, ) = mpf 1(h 1 + f0 f ). (30) potential depends radial position probe, also azimuth . quite interesting = /2, means probe disc plane discussed above, eect due rotation source disappears. form potential implies static probe suers attractive force source. general motion probe quite complicated. consider motion probe two self-consistent cases: one = 0 3 = const., = /2 3 = const.. rst case, implies probe moving hyperplane orthogonal disc plane, action reduces = mpz f 1, (31) (32) l2 r2 2m r4 ! , f = 1 + r4 r4 , = = 1 + l2 r2 , h = 1 = h = 2m r4 1 1 + r4 = r8 + m2 m. dependence motion angular coordinate disap- pears automatically, radial eective potential expressed v (r) = e"1 mphh 2ef 1 h (1 + f f0 + ef /mp)2!# . (33) interested so-called eld theory limit, one f f0 = r4/r4. eective potential reduces r4hh 2r4 v (r) = e"1 h (1 + r4 1 (34) /r4)2!# . = er4/mp. rotating d3-brane solution (1), horizon r+, determined r4 h = 0, r2 + = 1 2 (cid:16)l4 + 8m l2(cid:17) . (35) (34) nd potential constant e horizon r+ central force, f (r) = dv (r)/dr, probe vanishes there. furthermore, turning point horizon. therefore probe absorbed source locate horizon. note case innite red-shift hyperplane event horizon background coincide other. second case, namely, = /2 3 = const., due dependence angular coordinate , motion still complicated. simplify problem, set = 0, namely, angular momentum probe vanishes simplied situation. thus action probe also expressed (31), 8 f = 1 + r4 r4 , f0 = 1 + r4 r4 , h = 1 2m r4 , h = 1 + l2 r2 2m r4 . eld theory limit, eective potential becomes v (r) = e"1 r4hh 2r4 1 h (1 + r4 /r4)2!# . (36) (37) case two turning points: one horizon r+ r4 c = 2m, determined h = 0. note latter innite red-shift hyperplane case. two turning points potential constant e, central force vanish there. rc > r+ probe bounced back rc. compare case static source interesting. static source case, one h = h = 1 2m/r4. case, turning point coincides horizon force probe vanishes. thus probe captured locate horizon. calculations wilsonian potential non-extremal supergravity solutions (for example see {$9705053$}), assumed non-extremal branes locate horizon non-extremal backgrounds. analysis section provides evidence assumption, least static background: indeed brane locate horizon backgrounds. however, rotating background, dynamics brane restricted disc plane poses puzzle: vanishing angular momentum brane cannot locate horizon. perhaps consider probe brane angular velocity background. brane, expect locate horizon. iii. thermodynamics probe d3-brane rotating d3-brane background near extremal limit, thermodynamic quantities rotating d3-brane solu- tion (1) expressed follows {$9705053$}: e = 332mv3, j = 7/43/2n 1/2m1/2lv3, = 5/41/2n 1/2m1/2lr2 +, = 211/41/2n 1/2m1/2(2r3 = 211/43/2n 1/2m1/2r+v3. + + l2r+), (38) r+ given (35); e denotes energy extremality equals adm mass black three-brane minus mass corresponding extremal one; j, , represent angular momentum, angular velocity, hawking temper- 4 g ature, entropy, respectively. addition, 22 = 16g = (2)7g2 newton gravitational constant ten dimensions. quantities satisfy rst law thermodynamics de = ds + dj. (39) {$9705053$} observed heat capacity constant angular velocity, c = (s/t ), diverges l2 = 2r2 +, namely, l4/m = 8/3, beyond heat capacity 9 becomes negative. means n =4 large n sym corresponding rotating d3-brane conguration phase transition. critical behavior critical point investigated relevant critical exponents obtained {$9705053$}. recall sym theory corresponding rotating d3-brane solution higgs phase. thus occurrence phase transition rotating conguration agreement observation phase transitions may present higgs phase {$9703031$}. corresponding thermodynamic system, gibbs free energy, dened g = e j, gn = 1 2 32r2 +(r2 + + l2)v3, helmholtz free energy, dened f = e s, + l2)v3. fn = 32r2 +(r2 1 2 (40) (41) gibbs free energy change sign, helmholtz free energy r2 + = l2, is, l4/m = 1. however, clear whether change sign related hawking-page phase transition, takes place schwarzschild- anti-de sitter black holes. phase transition interpreted witten connement/unconnement phase transition sym theory {$9703031$}. next consider thermodynamics probe d3-brane. static probe, explained tseytlin yankielowicz {$9703031$}, distance source regarded mass scale sym, hence interaction static potential source probe interpreted contribution massive states free energy large n sym strong hooft coupling. rotating d3-brane background (1), keep relative static position probe rotating source, let probe rotate along orbit direction angular velocity = . euclidean action probe gp = t3v3f 1 sh f r2 2 sin2 + sin2 ! , 1 + f0 f + (1 f )l sinh 4ml cosh r4 sin2 (42) = 1/t inverse hawking temperature. since interested thermo- dynamics sym theory maldacena conjecture, consider eld theory limit: r u, m4, gs gets xed. limit, r2 forms, dierence 22 replaced 22 = (2)7g2 (40) (41) remain forms well. l l, 0, + r2 +2 quantities (38) keep . furthermore, equations (39), (43) considering eld theory limit (43), f f0 = r4 4u4 , = 1 + l2 cos2 u2 , = 1 + l2 u2 , h = 1 . 2m u4 (44) 10 free energy probe reduces gp = t3v34u4 1 2m u4 r4 2mlr2 u4 vuut1 sin2 ! . r4 2 2u2 sin2 + 22mlr2 u4 sin2 (45) considered appearing tension t3 r4, parameter disappears free energy, makes contribution massive states free energy sym theory nite, gp = 222 v3nu4 vuut1 2m u4 2 u2 sin2 + 22ml u4 sin2 1 2ml u4 sin2 , (46) = 2ng2 ym = 4ngs hooft coupling constant. unlike case probe static non-extremal d3-brane background, free energy probe depends temperature source mass scale u scalar elds (see {$9703031$}), free energy depends temperature mass scale, also angular velocity source azimuth . fact, dependence azimuth means probe separated single direction source d3-branes. principle, eliminate l (46) using expressions hawking temperature angular velocity (38). practice, however, expression free energy would quite complicated did. keep form (46) following discussions. expression (46) free energy see minimum, occurs square root (46) zero, namely, 1 2m u4 2 u2 sin2 + 22ml u4 sin2 = 0.
