{$9902052$}. puzzling aspects already pointed within context {$9903228$}. ansatz {$9901076$} involves taking peculiar high energy limit along large n limit. instance, type iib string theory dened r10

imposes strong constraints be- havior conformal correlators large n limit. see next section, convolution (1.2) using ansatz (1.1) rather subtle. obtain exact numerical answer, one cannot simply replace gaussian distribution (1.1) simpler one, say delta function. see momentum conservation, though, section. 3 case two point amplitude, replacing gaussian wave packets delta functions, obtain (1

(1.7) together factor depending i, null result e1 e2 6= 1. expression singular e1 e2 = 1 equivalently e1 = e2. thus hope careful calculation result delta function 3(e1 e2) two point amplitude. dene delta function z 3(e1 e2)d2 = 1. together energy conservation 1 = 2, e1 = e2, implies momentum conservation e1e1 = e2e2. conservation due fact two point conformal correlation function singular one point sits future light-cone point. three point correlation function operator xed conformal invariance. constant, ho(t1, x1)o(t2, x2)o(t3, x3)i = (cos(t1 t2) x1 x2 + i)2 (cos(t2 t3) x2 x3 + i)2(cos(t1 t3) x1 x3 + i)2. (1.8) consider case two states incoming, one outgoing. gaussian wave packets force t1,2 center around /2, t3 center around /2. simply replace gaussian wave packets delta functions, expression becomes (1 e1 e2)2(1 e2 e3)2(1 e1 e3)2. (1.9) function singular whenever ei = ej 6= j. singular ei equal. thus expect careful treatment lead delta functions forcing ei equal. indeed consequence momentum conservation three point amplitude involving massless particles: momenta outlegs must collinear. easily seen following physical way. if, say, two incoming states collinear, one go center mass frame end product scattering never single massless particle. mathematically, result, two point amplitude case, consequence causality boundary theory: whenever two points separated null geodesics, correlation function becomes singular. three point function, singular lie light-cone. 4 raises puzzle already level three point amplitudes. imagine stable massive particles. case three point correlation still given formula similar (1.8) one replaces 2 (i + j k)/2, particles carry zero momentum internal space s5. correlation function becomes singular ei ej equal, provided + j > k. however nothing momentum conservation massive particles. therefore quite interesting note stable massive stringy states type iib theory. thus puzzle avoided. related feature conformal dimension stringy state divergent large n limit {$9802150$}, thus although convolution (1.2) exists nite n, large n limit exist. interesting see happens four point correlation function momentum conservation imposed. four point correlation function operator scaling dimension 4 xed conformal symmetry alone. scaling factor, function two independent cross-ratios. dene cross-ratios = r2 12r2 34 r2 13r2 24 , b = r2 12r2 34 r2 23r2 14 , correlation function written as, instance ho(t1, x1) . . .o(t4, x4) = f4(r2 ij) = yi<j4 r8/3 ij f (a, b), (1.10) (1.11) f undetermined function b. r2 ij given (1.4). unlike 2d conformal eld theories, f (a, b) constrained sym far know, since nontrivial symmetries extending conformal invariance discovered far. scaling factor (1.11) singular whenever two points separated null geodesics. f (a, b) singular case, since one b vanishes becomes innity. unlike two three point amplitudes, energy-momentum conservation general require two points light-cone. see general consequence, follow strategy replace r2 ij on-shell value: r2 12 = 1 e1 e2 = 2 sin2(12/2), r2 34 = 2 sin2(34/2), 13 = 1 + e3 e4 = 2 sin2(13/2), r2 23 = 2 sin2(23/2), r2 14 = 2 sin2(14/2), r2 24 = 2 sin2(24/2), r2 (1.12) 5 assumed particles 1 2 incoming, particles 3 4 outgoing; ij angle momentum ki momentum kj. use energy conservation e1 + e2 = e3 + e4 momentum conservation law e1e1 + e2e2 = e3e3 + e4e4, derive = 4e1e2 sin2(12/2) = 4e3e4 sin2(34/2), (1.13) one mandelstam variables. similarly = 4e1e3 sin2(13/2) = 4e2e4 sin2(24/2), u = 4e1e4 sin2(14/2) = 4e2e3 sin2(23/2). (1.14) see on-shell distances (1.12) simply related mandelstam variables. however, r2 ij also depends individual energies. appears way eliminate dependence energies use two cross-ratios since mandelstam variables satisfy relation + + u = 0, obtain = s2 t2 , b = s2 u2 . 1 + 1 b = 1. (1.15) (1.16) words, relation consequence energy-momentum conservation. experience two three point amplitudes tells us order 4 point scattering amplitude obey energy-momentum conservation, four point correlation function must singular (1.16) satised. correlation also singular whenever one r2 ij = 0 nothing energy-momentum conservation, singularity f (a, b) 1/a + 1/b = 1 must severe singularity correlation r2 ij vanishes. already explained, r2 ij = 0. new singularity observed dictated conformal invariance all. also, singularity demanded large n limit, since nite n momentum conservation anti-de sitter space. explain detail next section, f (a, b) must singular (1.16) one four solutions 4ab = (ab b)2, equation. 1 1 b = 1 6 (1.17) (1.18) 2. explicit calculations see explicit calculation based ansatz {$9901076$} quite dicult. able obtain closed form two pint amplitude, able complete calculation three point amplitude. however, show energy-momentum conservation ensured large r limit. discuss calculation four point amplitude. lot work left future. first, want simplify calculation general amplitude bit. shifting /2, incoming particle outgoing one, one always ignore quadratic term ansatz (1.1), one remembers integral always pick important contribution around 0. see this, consider integral z dte 2 t2+itf (t, . . .), (2.1) dots denote variables. f (t) periodic function period 2. express f (t, . . .) f (t, . . .) = z f (, . . .)eit, z dte 2 t2+itf (t, . . .) = r 2 z de ( )2 f (, . . .). (2.2) integral centers around width , compared principle value , deviation tends zero large limit. thus integral approximately 2 f (, . . .) = z dteitf (t, . . .). compared approximate value, deviation ignored f (, . . .) , f(, . . .)/ f (, . . .) 1/. (2.3) (2.4) condition generally satised. alternatively, already saw, function f (t, . . .) innitely many poles. integral pick poles, gaussian factor exp((/2)t2) helps suppress poles except one closest zero. case, factor exp(it) important gaussian factor, since oscillates fast around 1/. 7 demonstrate result, let us see energy conservation derived large limit. general scattering amplitude, z yi dtie 1 2 pi it2 +ipi aiitif (ti, . . .), (2.5) ai = 1 outgoing state, 1 incoming state. use new set times: t1, ti = + t1, = 2, . . . , n. function f (ti, . . .) function only, since correlation function sym invariant time translation. performing integral t1 rst, obtain integrand r 2 e 1 2 (p aii)2 1 2 2 1 2 p 2 +ip aiiif (i, . . .), (2.6) = p i, omitted term (x aii)(x ii) exponential. rst exponential together prefactor gives rise delta function large r limit 2 r (x aiei), (2.7) energy conservation law. factor obtained without including gaussian factors. remaining gaussian factor (2.6) positive denite i, argued before, ignored long pick poles closest zero i. integral variables s3 much complicated, since gaussian factor exp((i/2)|xi ei|2) nontrivial factor convolution, one treat convolution carefully. following, examine two, three four amplitudes separately. that, let us remark gaussian factor replaced d4ki (2i)2 e e 2 |xiei|2 = z d4ki = z 2 +iiki(eixi). (2)2 e k2 2i k2 +iki(eixi) 8 (2.8) 2.1. two point amplitude shown above, integration center times results factor 2 r (e1 e2). remaining part 1n2(re1)3z d4k1 (2)2 d4k2 (2)2 ek2 1k2 2 /2+i1p kieif2(ki), f2(ki) = z dtd1d2ei1ti1p aikixi(cos x1 x2 i)4, (2.9) (2.10) (2.11) eq.(2.10) introduced normalization factor n2 depending normalization operator o. integral (2.11) performed rst. picks pole = 12 i, x1 x2 = cos 12. poles suppressed gaussian factor omitted. leading contribution f2(ki) = 3 3 1 z d1d2ei12i1p aikixi 1 sin4(12 i) , (2.12) terms suppressed powers 1. performing integration 2 rst, see momentarily fact result function k1 k2 ensures momentum conservation large r limit. plugging back result (2.10), ignoring prefactor (2.10) moment, have, changing variables k1 k2 = 2/2, k1 + k2 = 1/2 25 3 4 1 z d41e2 1+i11(e1e2)z d42 21|2| e2 2+i12(e1+e2)j1(21|2|).

(2.13) due delta function, second integral (2.14) simplied. integral 2 separated radial part angular part, latter easily performed. end, obtain 285 3 (1)3/23(e1 e2)z dkkj 2 1 (21k)ek2 . (2.16) large 1 limit, bessel function j1 replaced asymptotic form, namely z 0 dkkj 2 1 (21k)ek2 1 1 z dk cos2(21k)ek2 , since large 1, cos factor replaced average value 1/2, value integral (1/4)(1/1). checked result using formula integral (2.16) involving bessel function. substitute (2.16), nd (2)6 3 13(e1 e2). (2.17) together prefactor (2.10) delta function (2.9), end result h1 e12 e2+i = 1n2 (2)7 3r3 e2 1 (e1 e2)3(e1 e2). (2.18) using identity follows 4(e1e1 e2e2) = e3 1 (e1 e2)3(e1 e2) h1e12 e2+i = 1n2 (2)7 3r3 e14(e1e1 e2e2). (2.19) conservation momentum two point amplitude also ensures conservation energy, obtained right delta function, expected intuitive argument last section. remains check whether kinetic factor also right. note rst normalization factor (2.19) depends overlap two wave functions {$9901076$}, depend energy. normalization factor, n2, depend energy, although function r gs. wave function {$9901076$} takes form f (t, x) = ei(tex) 2 (x2 +(tex)2) (2.20) 10 near center ads space. gaussian factor ignored long spacetime region scale smaller 1/. proper scale r/ r. large r limit gaussian factor ignored plan wave. since creation operator dened = z dv tf (t, x) + . . . , close center ads space have, roughly (t, x) = z d4k e (cid:0)+(k)eiet+ikx + (k)eietkx(cid:1) , (2.21) coordinates proper ones, unlike ones (2.20). thus expect scattering amplitude, numerical factor, must h1 e12 e2+i = r5e14(e1e1 e2e2), (2.22) volume factor r5 comes internal space s5, since particles zero momenta internal space. kinetic factor precisely (2.19). therefore, appears normalization order 1, n2 r8 n 2g2 . 2.2. three point amplitude consider three point amplitude two incoming particles. convenient integrate t3 rst, t1 = 1 + t3, t2 = 2 + t3. delta function ensuring energy conservation results. amplitude a3 = n3 2 r (e1 + e2 e3)yi 3/2 z yi d4ki (2)2 e1/2p k2 +ip iki eif3(ki), (2.23) f3(ki) = z d1d2yi dieiii+iikixi (cos(1 2) x1 x2 + i)2(cos 1 x1 x3 i)2(cos 2 x2 x3 i)2, (2.24) reected x3 x3. denote xi xj cos ij . perform integral rst, use following formula (cos cos i)2 = 1 sin2( i) z 11 d||eii||(i), (2.25) derived (cos cos i)1 = sin( i) z deii||(i) (2.26) taking derivative respect once. fourier transform (2.25), integral (2.24) readily performed, result di f3(ki) = z yi z d|(1 )(2 + )|ei||12i|1|13i|2+|23|. sin2(12 + i) sin2(13 i) sin2(23 i) exp(iiki xi) (2.27) know carry calculation integral. one thing certain, though, due singular behavior integrand, integral peaked around 12 = 13 = 23 = 0. thus expect f3 function piki only. argue ensures momentum conservation large r limit. introduce new vectors l1 = 1 23 xiki, l2 = p2/3k1 + 13k2 l3 = p1/(23)k1 +p2/(23)k2 1/2k3.

(2.29) seen integral l3 results delta function ensuring momentum conser- vation, large r limit. calculation, obtain 211/25/2e2 3 a3 = n3 e3 1 e3 2 (2)2 e1/2l2 z d4l1 (x aiei)4(x aieiei) 1+i21l1e1 f3(l1). 12 (2.30) 2.3. four point amplitude much less say four point amplitude. although trust condition energy-momentum conservation derived previous section necessary, able prove also sucient. two three point amplitude cases, always write four point amplitude a4 = n4z 4 yi=1 d4ki (2)2 e1/2p k2 +ip ikiei f4(ki), (2.31) f4 given similar formula (2.24). omitted factor conserving energy. see whether momentum conservation true large r limit, previous subsection, introduce set new vectors li = xj ijkj, (2.32) {ij} orthogonal matrix. choose 1i = aipi/, = pi i. large r limit, f4(li) less dependent l1 li, integral l1 (2.31) performed rst, thus resulting delta function associated momentum conservation. shown condition 1/a + 1/b = 1 singularity f (a, b) necessary one, f (a, b) function introduced (1.11). far clear whether also sucient condition conserving momentum. finally, want show 1/a + 1/b = 1 singularity f (a, b), 1/a 1/b = 1 1/a 1b = 1 also singularities f (a, b). f (a, b) symmetric function b. see this, go euclidean space. exchange point 1 point 2, b exchanged. exchange point 2 point 3 led 1/a, b b/a, thus f (1/a, b/a) = f (a, b) = f (b, a). (2.33) singular relation satised. renaming variables, conclude f (a, b) now, 1/a + 1/b = 1 pa/b = 1. means f (1/a, b/a) singular 1/a 1/b = 1. exchanging b, deduce f (a, b) singular 1/a 1/b = 1. 13 3. conclusion scratched surface problem investigating consequence lorentz invariance holographic s-matrix associated correlation functions large n limit. instance, constraints derived requirement a4 function t, apart kinetic factor. even interesting, consequence causality space limit. leave problems future investigations. main result paper identication new singularity four point amplitude, large n limit. means dominant contribution scattering amplitude comes around saddle point. reminds us problem sensitive initial conditions raised {$9903228$}. observed two beams aimed center ads emitted boundary time dierence greater 1/r, beams miss other. large n limit, time dierence arbitrarily small. appears kind sharp saddle point may help understand puzzle. presumably consequence locality bulk space. remains see whether bulk locality together boundary conformal invariance guarantee bulk poincare invariance large n limit. acknowledgments work supported doe grant de-fg02-90er-40560 nsf grant phy 91-23780. grateful r. siebelink collaboration initial stage project. useful discussions p. kraus helped going dicult phase. correspondence j. polchinski acknowledged. also grateful p-m. ho helpful discussions. work completed visit national taiwan university, thank p-m. ho, w-y. p. hwang y-c. kao hospitality. 14
