abstract

we construct the supercurrent multiplet that contains the energy-momentum tensor of the
(2, 0) tensor multiplet. by coupling this multiplet of currents to the elds of conformal
supergravity, we rst construct the linearized superconformal transformations rules of the
(2, 0) weyl multiplet. next, we construct the full non-linear transformation rules by gauging
the superconformal algebra osp(8|4). we then use this result to construct the full equa-
tions of motion of the tensor multiplet in a conformal supergravity background. coupling
n + 5 copies of the tensor multiplet to conformal supergravity and imposing a geometrical
constraint on the scalar elds which xes the conformal symmetry, we obtain the coupling of
(2, 0) poincare supergravity to n tensor multiplets in which the physical scalars parametrize
the coset so(n, 5)/(so(n)  so(5)).

1 introduction

there is an increasing evidence for the fact that m-theory on anti de sitter (ads) back-
grounds can be described by a conformal eld theory at the boundary of ads, at least in
a suitable limit. the low energy limits involved in the bulk of ads are the gauged super-
gravity theories in various dimensions and the boundary eld theories are certain globally
supersymmetric eld theories appropriate to the branes involved.

in verifying the ads/cft correspondence, the boundary values of the bulk elds naturally
arise. in accordance with the fact that ads supersymmetry in a given dimension acts as
the conformal supersymmetry at the boundary of ads, the boundary values of the bulk
elds are in one-to-one correspondence with the elds of conformal supergravity dened at
the boundary. thus, it is natural to formulate the boundary eld theory in a conformal
supergravity background. integration over the boundary (matter) elds should then yield
an eective action involving the conformal supergravity elds, which is to be compared with
the bulk supergravity eective action.

this approach was followed in [1], where the coupling of n = 4, d = 4 super yang-mills
to n = 4, d = 4 conformal supergravity [2] was studied, as the boundary eld theory asso-
ciated with gauged supergravity in ads5. in this spirit, we wish to construct the coupling
of the (2, 0) tensor multiplet to (2, 0) conformal supergravity at the six dimensional bound-
ary of ads7. this result is expected to provide a convenient framework in studying the
ads7/cf t6 correspondence. since the (2, 0) tensor multiplet contains a chiral 2-form, it is
natural to study its eld equations rather than an action from which they may be derivable
but which may require the introduction of additional elds. thus, we shall primarily study
the covariant eld equations, although we shall briey discuss an action from which all but
the self-duality condition follows, provided that the self-duality equation is imposed after
the variation.

the conformal supergravity elds form an o-shell multiplet. we can treat them as back-
ground elds, in which case we need not impose their equations of motion. however, coupling
of conformal supergravity to n + 5 copies of the (2, 0) tensor multiplet, we can constrain
the scalars elds coming from these tensor multiplets so that they become a representative
of the coset
so(n )so(5). as we will show, this readily leads to the description of the (2, 0)
poincare supergravity coupled to n tensor multiplets [3, 4].

so(n,5)

the organization of this paper is as follows. in sec. 2, we derive the multiplet of supercur-
rents and the linearized weyl multiplet. in sec. 3, we construct the full (2, 0) conformal
supergravity theory. as we did before for the (1, 0) case [5], we follow the methods developed
rst for n = 1 in 4 dimensions [6]. they are based on gauging the conformal superalgebra
[7], which, in our case, is osp(8|4). as is typical in this method, one then has to impose
constraints on some of the curvatures. in sec. 4, we nd the complete equations of motions
for a single tensor multiplet in a conformal supergravity background. in sec. 5, we con-

1

sider n + 5 copies of the tensor multiplet in conformal supergravity background and show
that a geometrical constraint on the scalars leads to the equations of motion of poincare
supergravity coupled to n tensor multiplets. in this, we follow the approach of [8], which
has been used extensively to obtain matter couplings in 4 dimensions for n = 1 [9], n = 2
[10] and n = 4 [11]. further comments on our results and open problems are collected
in the conclusions. our notations and conventions are presented in appendix a and the
truncation of our results to the (1, 0) case [5] are described in appendix b, as we used that
correspondence to obtain our present results. a superspace description of the tensor, current
and weyl multiplets is given in appendix c.

2 the (2, 0) supercurrent multiplet

our starting point is the (2, 0) tensor multiplet in d = 6 minkowski spacetime describing
8 + 8 degrees of freedom. this is the only on-shell (2, 0) matter multiplet in d = 6. its eld
components are given in table 2. it contains a 2-form potential b whose self-dual eld
strength is dened by

h = 3[b] ,

h = 1

3!  h   h .

(2.1)

it also contains 5 real scalars ij (i = 1, ..., 4) which transforms as a 5-plet of usp(4) and a
symplectic majorana-weyl spinor i. the basic properties of these elds are tabulated in
table 1.

the complete rigid superconformal transformations have been given in [12] where the ten-
sor multiplet was studied as the m5-brane worldvolume supermultiplet. for our present

the supersymmetry transformations close provided that the following linearized eld equa-
tions are satised

h  =6 i = ij = 0 .

(2.4)

to construct the current multiplet, we start from the noether currents of the (2, 0) tensor
multiplet. these noether currents are: the energy-momentum tensor , the supersymmetry
currents ji and the usp(4) currents vij
 . we will use the improved currents that satisfy the
following equations:

ji = 0 ,

ji = 0 ,

vij

(2.5)

these symmetry properties determine the currents up to constants, which we have deter-
mined by requiring the closure of the rigid linearized supersymmetry transformations. we
thus nd the currents

currents eq. (2.6), always using the eld equations eq. (2.4), we nd a full supermultiplet
of operators bilinear in the elds:1

in the next section, we generalize the above transformation rules to obtain the full local
superconformal transformation rules.

3 the (2,0) conformal supergravity theory

the theory is based on the superconformal algebra osp(8|4) whose generators are labeled

ta = pa , qi , uij , mab , ka , si , d ,

(3.1)

where a, b,    are lorentz indices,  is a chiral spinor index and i, j = 1,    4 are usp(4)
indices. mab and pa are the poincare generators, ka is the special conformal transformation,
d the dilatation, qi and si are the supersymmetry and special supersymmetry genera-
tors, respectively, which are symplectic majorana-weyl spinors, 16 real components in total.
finally, u ij = u ji are the usp(4) generators. for more details on the osp(8|4) algebra
and the rigid superconformal transformations, see [12].

the gauge elds corresponding to the above generators are

e

a , i

 , v ij

 , 

ab , f

a , i

 , b .

(3.2)

however, in the realization (weyl multiplet) which will gauge the algebra, these elds are
not all independent. the independent elds are given in eq. (2.11), where the rst three are
the gauge elds corresponding to the generators pa , qi and uij. it is understood that the

6

a. the last three are
linearized gravitational eld h has been replaced by the sechsbein e
matter elds needed for the realization of the superconformal algebra. the remaining gauge
elds are either dependent (
) (see below), or can be shifted away (b) using ka
invariance.

the (2, 0) weyl multiplet describes 128+128 o-shell degrees of freedom. we rst present the

where d, k a, ab and ij are the parameters of dilatation, special conformal, lorentz and

t,  and d under dilatations, lorentz and usp(4) transformations follow from the rules
(3.3) and from table 1. all matter elds are inert under the special conformal transforma-
tions k.

4 the (2, 0) tensor multiplet in the conformal super-

gravity background

the equations of motion and the supersymmetry transformations of the (2, 0) tensor mul-
tiplet in minkowski space time are given in eq. (2). here we shall extend this result to
full conformal supergravity background. the procedure for coupling matter multiplets to
the conformal supergravity has been described in detail for the (1, 0) case in [5]. the same
procedure can be applied here. however, we have taken a shortcut and applied the (2, 0) to
(1, 0) reduction procedure described in appendix b. we thus nd that the full nonlinear q
and s-transformations of the (2, 0) tensor multiplet are given by:

b =  + i[j

i = 1

4 6dijj  ijj ,

furthermore, we nd that the eld equations of the (2, 0) tensor multiplet are given by3

3 note that, in contradistinction to the (1,0) case the rst eld equation can not be used to solve for
the matter eld t in terms of h  (the scalar  is not a singlet under usp(4)). therefore, the (2,0) weyl
multiplet has no alternative formulation containing an antisymmetric tensor gauge eld like the (1,0) weyl
multiplet (see [5]).

manifestly lorentz invariant action requires the introduction of an auxiliary scalar eld [14].
it has been shown in [12] that this can straightforwardly be implemented in a rigid conformal
theory. we expect that this can be extended for the local superconformal case.
an alternative approach is to relax the chirality condition on the 2-form potential and to
write an action which is not invariant, but whose variation is proportional to f 
abc. it gives
the correct equations of motion provided that the self-duality condition f 
abc = 0 is imposed
after the action is varied [15, 16, 4, 17]. such an action takes the form

5 poincare supergravity coupled to n (2,0) tensor

multiplets from the superconformal theory

in this section we construct the matter couplings to n = 4 supergravity by using the su-
perconformal tensor calculus and by imposing the so(n, 5) symmetry. we hereby closely
follow the procedure of coupling n = 4, d = 4 vector multiplets as in [18]. we begin by
introducing (n + 5) copies of the (2, 0) tensor multiplets with elds bi
i where
i = 1, ..., n + 5 labels the vector representation of so(n, 5). we have denoted the scalars
by lij
i because they will shortly be constrained. the constraint will be solved in terms of
independent scalar elds which will again be denoted by .

transformations, reduces the number of independent scalars to (n + 5)  5  15  10 = 5n,
which is the dimension of the coset
so(n )so(5). it is convenient to introduce an (n + 5)  n

the constraint eq. (5.3) is invariant under ssupersymmetry. however, varying it under

this constraint is easily solved as

where ri (r = 1, ..., n) are the independent fermionic elds.

requiring that the trace part of the constraint eq. (5.5) is invariant under the combined q
and stransformations, and using eqs. (5.6)-(5.8) and performing fierz re-arrangement, we
determine the ssupersymmetry parameter:

the poincare supersymmetry transformations of these elds can be found from eq. (3.7)

comparing the result eq. (5.14) with that of [4], we nd that all the structures are in agree-
ment except the last term in ir, which is missing in [4].

the self-duality condition eq. (5.8) serves as the full eld equation for the 2-form potential
bi
. the remaining eld equations follow from the closure of the algebra eq. (5.14). the
resulting eld equations can be found in [3, 4].

6 conclusions

in this paper we have constructed the local conformal supersymmetry rules for (2, 0) su-
pergravity in 6 dimensions. that includes the transformation rules for the weyl multiplet
eq. (3.7), which is the gauge multiplet of the osp(8|4) superconformal algebra and the
transformation laws eq. (4.1) of the tensor multiplet. the latter has eld equations given by
eq. (4.5). these results can be viewed as the quadratic approximation to the coupling of the
full m5 brane theory to conformal supergravity in a physical gauge. it would be interesting
to obtain the full coupling of the m5-brane to the (2, 0) conformal supergravity.

taking n + 5 copies of the tensor multiplets and imposing the constraints described in
section 5, yields poincare supergravity theory coupled to n tensor multiplets [3, 4]. the
generalization of these results to the case of n coincident m5 branes is, of course, a non-
trivial problem.

another extension of our work is the construction of the higher spin operators of the (2, 0)
tensor multiplets [19] and their coupling to appropriate higher spin conformal supergravity
elds. of special interest are the operators which correspond to massless higher spin elds in
the bulk of ads7. these arise from the product of two doubleton representations of osp(8|4)
[20]. it is natural that these operators couple to massless higher spin representation of this
group. a eld theoretic realization of a higher spin ads7 supergravity is an interesting and
challenging problem at present.

a notations and conventions

we use the same notations as in [5]. we raise and lower indices with ij as:

i = ijj ,

i = jji .

(a.1)

when usp(4) indices are omitted, northwest-southeast contraction is understood, e.g.

where we have used the following notation

(n) = i(n)i ,

(n) = a1 an = [a1a2    an] .

(a.2)

(a.3)

the anti-symmetrizations are always with unit strength. changing the order of spinors in a
bilinear leads to the following signs

(1)(n)(2) = tn (2)(n)(1) ,

( tn = 1 for n = 0, 3, 4

tn = 1 for n = 1, 2, 5, 6

(a.4)

where the labels (1) and (2) denote any usp(4) representation, e.g. (1) = i and (2) = [jk].
we frequently use the following fierz rearrangement formula:

j i =  1

4 ( iaj)a + 1

48( iabcj)abc .

(a.5)

the notation - (trace) denotes terms that are proportional to either ij or i
j (with free
indices). we use the notation -(traces) if both invariant tensors occur. for the convenience
of the reader we give below the explicit expressions of some trace terms:

x ij  (trace) = x ij + 1

4ijx k

k ,

aijxk  (traces) = aijxk + 4

k  1

5ijakx  ,

sk

[ix j]  (traces) = sk

[ix j]  1

k sj]x + 1

5ijsk

x .

(a.6)

5a[ixj]

where x i and x ij are arbitrary usp(4) tensors, while aij is an antisymmetric traceless and
sij a symmetric tensor.

b the (2,0)  (1,0) truncation

many of the formulae for the (2, 0) weyl and tensor multiplet can be obtained by considering
their truncations to the (1, 0) case and comparing with the results of [5]. following [21] the
(2, 0) weyl multiplet may also be compared with the n=4, d=4 weyl multiplet of [11].

we rst consider the (2, 0) weyl multiplet. the (2, 0) weyl multiplet (3.7) leads to the
n = 2 weyl multiplet of [5] (see eq. (2.26)) upon making the following truncations. we
write i = 1,    , 4 = (i = 1, 2, i = 1, 2), and we put

the nonvanishing bosonic component elds are given by

ij = (cid:18) ij

0

ij (cid:19) .

v ij

t ij
abc = ijtabc ,

kl = ijkld , dij

kl = ij 

(b.1)

(b.2)

kld ,

dij 

kl = ij

kl =  1

for example, the rst equation above means that v ij 
fermionic component elds are given by

 = 0 = v ij 

 . the non-vanishing

i
 = i

 ,

k
ij = ijk ,

ij  = ij k ,
k

k
ij =  1

2 k

i j .

(b.3)

thus, for example, i = 0. finally, the nonvanishing supersymmetry parameters are given
by

i = i ,

i = i ,

(b.4)

which means that i = 0 = i.
in comparing the truncated result with the (1, 0) weyl
multiplet of [5] two remarks are in order. first of all the (1, 0) conventional constraints of
[5] contain extra  and d-dependent terms which do not generalize to the (2, 0) case. as
a consequence the dependent k and s gauge elds, obtained after truncation, dier from

16

those of [5]. in order to obtain the truncated result one should replace the k and s gauge
elds of [5] by the following expressions

f

a  f

a + 1

i
  i

  1

ad ,

240e
60 i .

(b.5)

secondly, in order to remove the dependent term from the supersymmetry variation of
the dilatation gauge eld b (again this term cannot be generalized to the (2, 0) case) one
must perform a eld-dependent k-transformation on the results of [5] with the following
parameter

k =  1

60  .

(b.6)

the net eect of these manipulations is that all -dependent terms in the (1, 0) theory that
cannot be extended to the (2, 0) case are being removed.

next we consider the (2,0) tensor multiplet. the truncation of this multiplet to the (1,0)
case treated in [5] is given by:

ij = ij ,

ij 

= ij 

 ,

ij 

= 0 ,

i = i ,

i

= 0 .

(b.7)

in order to show that the ij eld equation (see third equation of eq. (4.5)) truncates
correctly to the (1, 0) equation (see eq. (3.27) of [5]) one has to take special care of the
d,  and  terms. concerning the d term, starting from the (1, 0) case, the redef-
a leads to an extra d term which is added to the explicit d term
inition eq. (b.5) of fa
in the equation of motion (3.27) of [5]. as for the  terms, the redenition of  (see
eq. (b.5)) in the d term plus the compensating k transformation given in eq. (b.6)
lead to two extra  terms such that the total contribution cancels. this is consistent
with the fact that the truncation of the  term in eq. (4.8) vanishes identically. finally,
the redenition of  in the  term in dada (see eq. (3.30) of [5]) leads to an extra 
term which should be added to the explicit such contribution in the  eld equation. the
total then agrees with the (1, 0) truncation of our result eq. (4.5).

c tensor, current and weyl multiplets in superspace

the (2, 0) tensor multiplet in at superspace can be described by a supereld ij satisfying
the constraint [13]

di

jk = i[jk]

  (trace) .

(c.1)

17

in at superspace the current multiplet eq. (2.7) is described by the supercurrent [13]

j ij,kl = ijkl  (trace) ,

(c.2)

where the supereld ij describes the (2, 0) tensor multiplet.

in superspace the weyl multiplet eq. (3.7) is described by an anti-selfdual supereld w ij
abc
in the 5 of usp(4), whose rst component is the bosonic eld t ij
abc and which satises the
constraint
