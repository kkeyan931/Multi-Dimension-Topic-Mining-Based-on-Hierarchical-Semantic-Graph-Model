abstract

a regular method for constructing vortex-like solutions with cylin-
drical symmetry to the equations of the su(2) skyrme chiral model
is proposed. a numerical estimate for the length density of mass is
given.

the skyrme model [1] proved its eciency in modelling the structure of
baryons [2] and nuclei [3] since the appearance of wittens analysis of quark
connement problem[4,5]. the model considers pions as goldstone bosons
and uses the lagrangian density

l =

42 sp (ll) +

sp([l, l][l, l]),

(1)

constructed from the chiral current l = u +u, u  su(2). the energy in
the model is estimated from below through the topological charge

q =

which takes integer values and can be interpreted as baryon number.
in
particular, the nucleon emerges as an absolutely stable state with the min-
imal energy in the rst homotopic class (q = 1) [6]. unfortunately the
corresponding hedgehog conguration cannot be described analytically due
to complexity of the nonlinear equations for the chiral eld. the situation
is aggravated for the higher homotopic classes in view of nonseparability
of radial and angle variables. to overcome these diculties we propose to
approximate the congurations with higher charges by closed vortices. as

a rst step in this direction we consider in the present paper the simplest
static vortex conguration given by the matrix

u = exp (i ()),

 = (cid:20) 0

with ,  being cylindrical coordinates. the conguration (2) appears to be
equivariant under the group g = t (z)diag[so(2)i so(2)s] including the
translation along the vortex and combined isotopic-space rotations around
its axis. usually the massive term proportional to 2  u  u + is added
to the expression (1). though its role being essential for the existence of
regular solutions, we omit it in the present text, with the aim to illustrate
the method and to simplify the formulae.

substituting (2) in (1) amounts to the radial lagrangian density for the

chiral angle ():

l =

.

after the change of variable  = 2et,   t  +, we obtain the

mechanical problem given by the action functional

i[] =

z

dth 2(1 + 2e2t sin2 ) + sin2 i ,

(3)

where the dimensionless parameter 2 is reserved for the technical purposes.

from (3) one derives the canonical momentum

p = 2 (1 + 2e2t sin2 ) = s

and the hamilton-jacobi equation

 sin2  = 0.

now we search for the solution to the eq.(5) as a formal series

s(t, ) =



xn=0

2nsn(t, ).

inserting (6) into (5) we get the recurrence relation

with the evident private solution for n = 0 :

s0 = w0() = 2 cos .

in order to satisfy (7) we put for n > 0

sn(t, ) = e2ntwn().

from (7), (8) and (9) we derive for n = 1 the equation

sin  w 

1 + 2w1 + sin4  = 0

(9)

with the two dierent solutions (two branches) corresponding to the ranges
/2     and 0    /2 respectively:

for n > 1 we deduce from (7), (8) and (9) the equation

where a+ = , a = 0. formulae (10), (11) and (12) determine the recurrent
procedure for constructing the solution to the hamilton-jacobi equation (5).
putting this solution to the r.h.s. of the equation (4), one can nd the
canonical momentum p for the two branches of solution:

p = 2 (1 + 2e2t sin2 ) =



xn=0

2ne2ntw 

n().

(13)

for matching these branches at the point  = /2, t = t0 one deduces

from (13) the algebraic equation



xn=1

2ne2nt0[w +

in particular, within the scope of n = 2 approximation one gets from (14)

the eective development parameter

2e2t0 = 2(16 ln 2  37/15)1  0, 232

that permits to calculate the mass of the vortex (its length density):

m = 

2 i = 

2 [s (+, 0)  s (t0, /2) + s +(t0, /2)  s +(, )] =

2 [1 + 2 + 2(41/15  8 ln 2) + o(3)]  4
in conclusion we notice that the function (t), dening the radial dis-
tribution of matter inside the vortex, can be found from eq.(13) which is
represented in the integral form:
