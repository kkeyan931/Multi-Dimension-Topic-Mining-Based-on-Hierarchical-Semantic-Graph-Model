null branes in string theory backgrounds

p. bozhilov 1,

jinr, 141980 dubna, russia

we consider null bosonic p-branes moving in curved space-times and develop a

method for solving their equations of motion and constraints, which is suitable for

string theory backgrounds. as an application, we give an exact solution for such back-

ground in ten dimensions.

1 introduction

the null p-branes are the zero tension limit tp  0 of the usual p-branes, the
1-brane being a string. this relationship between them generalizes the correspondence

between massless and massive particles. thus, the tensionless branes may be viewed

as a high energy limit of the tensile ones.

the p-branes are characterized by an energy scale t 1/(p+1)

p

and therefore by a length

scale t 1/(p+1)

p

. the gravitational eld provides another length scale, the curvature

radius of the space-time rc. for a p-brane moving in a gravitational eld an appropriate

p

parameter is the dimensionless constant d = rct 1/(p+1)
. large values of d imply weak
gravitational eld. one may reach such values of d by letting tp  . in the opposite
limit, small values of d, one encounters strong gravitational elds and it is appropriate
to consider tp  0, i.e. null or tensionless branes.

a lagrangian which could describe under certain conditions null bosonic branes

in d-dimensional minkowski space-time was rst proposed in [1]. an action for a

tensionless p-brane with space-time supersymmetry was rst given in [2]. since then,

other types of actions (with and without supersymmetry) have been introduced and

studied in the literature [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]. owing to their zero tension, the worldvolume

of the null p-branes is a light-like hypersurface imbedded in the minkowski space-time.

correspondingly, the determinant of the induced metric is zero. as in the tensile case,

the null brane actions can be written in reparametrization and space-time conformally

1

invariant form. however, their distinguishing feature is that at the classical level they

may have any number of global space-time supersymmetries and be -invariant in all

dimensions, which support majorana (or weyl) spinors. at the quantum level, they are

anomaly free and do not exhibit any critical dimension [9, 3, 6, 10], the only exception

being the tensionless branes with manifest conformal invariance, with critical dimension

d = 2 [6].

almost all of the above investigations deal with free null branes moving in at back-

ground (a qualitative consideration of null p-brane interacting with a scalar eld has

been done in [3]). the interaction of tensionless membranes (p = 2) with antisymmet-

ric background tensor eld in four dimensional minkowski space, described by means

of wess-zumino-like action is studied in [11]. the resulting equations of motion are

successfully integrated exactly.

to our knowledge, the only papers till now devoted to the classical dynamics of null

p-branes (p  2) moving in curved space-times are [12, 13, 14].

in [12], the null p-branes living in d-dimensional friedmann-robertson-walker

space-time with at space-like section (k = 0) have been investigated. the correspond-

ing equations of motion have been solved exactly. it was argued that an ideal uid of

null p-branes may be considered as a source of gravity for friedmann-robertson-walker

universes.

in [13], the classical mechanics of the null branes in a gravity background was for-

mulated. the brst-bfv approach in its hamiltonian version was applied to the

considered dynamical system. some exact solutions of the equations of motion and

of the constraints for the null membrane in general stationary axially symmetric four

2

dimensional gravity background were found. the examples of minkowski, de sitter,

schwarzschild, taub-nut and kerr space-times were considered. another exact solu-

tion, for the demianski-newman background, can be found in [14].

in this article we consider the classical evolution of tensionless bosonic branes in

curved backgrounds. in sec. 2 we briey describe the lagrangian and hamiltonian

formulation of the null p-branes moving in d-dimensional curved space-times. in sec. 3

we develop a method for solving the equations of motion and constraints in a particular

type of curved background.

in sec. 4, as an application of the method proposed,

we give an explicit exact solution for the ten dimensional solitonic ve-brane gravity

background. sec. 5 is devoted to our concluding remarks.

2 null branes in curved backgrounds

one of the possible actions for the null bosonic p-brane living in a d-dimensional

curved space-time with metric tensor gm n (x) is:

s = z dp+1l

,

m = /m

l = v mv nmxm nxn gm n (x),
m = (0, a) = (, a),

,

(1)

m, n = 0, 1, ..., p

,

a, b = 1, ..., p

,

m, n = 0, 1, ..., d  1.

it is an obvious generalization of the at space-time action given in [4, 5]. one easily

veries that if xm (), gm n () are world-volume scalars and v m() is a world-volume

contravariant vector density of weight q = 1/2, then l() is a scalar density of weight

3

q = 1. as a consequence, the variation of the action (1) is

s = z dp+1m(ml)

and thus this action is invariant under world-volume reparametrizations if suitable

boundary conditions are assumed.

varying (1) with respect to xn and v n, one obtains the following equations of

motion :

m(cid:16)v mv nnxk(cid:17) + k

m n v mv nmxm nxn = 0,

v mmxm nxn gm n (x) = 0,

where k

m n is the connection compatible with the metric gm n (x):

k

m n =

1
2

gkl(m gn l + n gm l  lgm n ).

let us rewrite the lagrangian density (1) in the form ( = /, a = /a):

l =

1
40 gm n (x)(  aa)xm (  bb)xn ,

where the connection between v m and (0, a) is given by

v m = (v 0, v a) =  

1
20

,

a

20!.

now the euler-lagrange equation for xn takes the form:

" 1

+

20 (  bb)xk#  a" a
1
20 k

20 (  bb)xk#
m n (  aa)xm (  bb)xn = 0.

4

(2)

(3)

the equations of motion for the lagrange multipliers 0 and a which follow from (2)

give the constraints :

gm n (x)(  aa)xm (  bb)xn = 0,
gm n (x)(  bb)xm axn = 0.

(4)

(5)

now it is easy to check that in the gauge a = const

xm (, a) = xm (za),

za = a + a

is a nontrivial solution of the equations of motion (3) and of the constraints (4), (5) de-

pending on d arbitrary functions of p variables for the null p-brane moving in arbitrary

d-dimensional gravity background.

in terms of xm and the conjugated momentum pm the constraints (4) can be written

as:

t0 = gm n (x)pm pn = 0

,

ta = pn axn = 0.

then one can show that the hamiltonian which corresponds to the lagrangian density

(2) is a linear combination of t0 and ta

h = z dp(0t0 + ata).

computation of the poisson brackets between t0 and ta results in the following con-

straint algebra

{t0(~1), t0(~2)} = 0,
{t0(~1), ta(~2)} = [t0(~1) + t0(~2)]ap(~1  ~2),
{ta(~1), tb(~2)} = [c
~ = (1, ..., p).

atb(~1) + c

bta(~2)]cp(~1  ~2),

(6)

5

the equalities (6) show that the constraint algebra is the same for at and for curved

backgrounds. obviously this is not the case with the hamiltonian equations of motion,

which are:

(  aa)xn = 20gn k(x)pk,
 pm  a(apm ) + 0m gn k(x)pn pk = 0.

3 solving the equations of motion

from now on, we will work in the gauge 0, a = constants, in which the euler-

lagrange equations (3) have the form :

(  aa)(  bb)xk + k

m n (  aa)xm (  bb)xn = 0.

(7)

we are going to look for solutions of the equations of motion (7) and constraints (4),

(5) for the following type of gravity background

ds2 = gm n dxm dxn

(8)

= gqq(dxq)2 + 2gqsdxqdxs + gss(dxs)2 +

d1

xm =0,m 6=q,s

gm m (dxm )2,

where xq 6= xs are two arbitrary coordinates and it is supposed that gm n does not
depend on them.

to simplify the equations of motion (7) and constraints (4), (5), we introduce the

ansatz

xq(, ~) = c qf [w(~z)] + yq( ),

xs(, ~) = c sf [w(~z)] + ys( ),

(9)

xm (, ~) = ym ( )

for

m 6= q, s
6

where the arbitrary function f depends on za only trough the variable w, and c q, c s

are constants. inserting (9) in (4), (5) and (7), one obtains (the dot is used for d/d )

yk + k

m n ym yn = 0,

gm n ym yn = 0,

(c qgqq + c sgqs) yq + (c qgqs + c sgss) ys = 0.

(10)

(11)

(12)

it turns out that for the given metric (8), the equations for yq and ys in (10) become

linear dierential equations. on the other hand, with the help of (12), we can separate

the variables in them. the corresponding solution, compatible with (12), is (c = const)

yq( ) = c (c qgqs + c sgss) exp(h),
ys( ) = +c (c qgqq + c sgqs) exp(h),
h = z (cid:16)gqqdgqq + 2gqsdgqs + gssdgss(cid:17).

(13)

now we observe that if we introduce the matrix

h = 


then the following equality holds

gqq gqs

gqs gss

,




exp (h) = exp(cid:18)z t rh1dh(cid:19) = deth  h.

(14)

at the same time, the above equality is the compatibility condition for the solution

(13) with the other equations of motion and constraint (11).

using (13) and (14), the equations for the other coordinates and the remaining

constraint can be rewritten as (k, m, n 6= q, s)

yk + k

m n ym yn +

1
2

gkmm (cid:18)c 2 g

h(cid:19) = 0,

7

gm n ym yn +(cid:18)c 2 g

h(cid:19) = 0,

(15)

where

g = (c q)2gqq + 2c qc sgqs + (c s)2gss.

at this stage, taking into account the general structure of the string theory gravity

backgrounds in d dimensions, we introduce an additional restriction on the metric (8).

namely, we suppose that the set of values of the index m is expressed by the subsets

m = (q, s, , i) such that gm n does not depend on x(, ~) = y( ) in addition to xq,

xs. under this condition, one can reduce the order of the dierential equations for y

by one with the result

y = exp(cid:18)z gdg(cid:19) c  =

c 
g

,

c  = constants.

(16)

the condition on (16) to be in accordance with the equations for yi and the constraint

(15) is

2

dg
d

y y + g

d

d (cid:16) y y(cid:17) = 0,

and it is identically satised.

let us turn to the equations of motion for the remaining coordinates yi. these are:

yi + i

jk yj yk +

1
2

gij(cid:20)j(cid:18)c 2 g

h(cid:19)  (jg) y y(cid:21) = 0.

(17)

the following step is to use the equality

(jg) y y = j (cid:16)g y y(cid:17) ,

8

which is an identity on the solutions (16). this allow us to transform the equations

(17) into the form:

2

d

d (cid:16)gij yj(cid:17)  (igjk) yj yk + i(cid:18)c 2 g

h

+ g y y(cid:19) = 0.

taking into account that the matrix gij is a diagonal one, we can further transform the

equations for yi( ) to obtain (there is no summation over i):

d

d (cid:16)gii yi(cid:17)2

+ yii"gii c 2 g

h

+x

(c )2

g !# + yixj6=i

i  gii

gjj!(cid:16)gjj yj(cid:17)2

= 0.

(18)

in receiving (18), the constraint

gii( yi)2 +xj6=i

gjj( yj)2 +x

(c )2
g

+ c 2 g
h

= 0

(19)

is also used.

now it is evident from (18) that we can reduce the order of these dierential equa-

tions by one, if

or

i  gii

gjj! = 0

for

i 6= j

i(cid:16)gjj yj(cid:17)2

= 0

for

i 6= j.

(20)

(21)

keeping in mind the aim to apply our results to the string theory gravity backgrounds,

we choose the following combination of the two existing possibilities: for all coordinates

yi except one, which we call yr, the equalities (20) are fullled; for i = r, the equalities

(21) holds. then the result of integration, compatible with (19), is

(cid:16)gkk yk(cid:17)2

k 6= q, s, , r.

(23)

(24)

here ck, ek and er are arbitrary functions. ck depend on all coordinates on which

depends the metric, but yk (for every xed value of k). ek do not depend on yr, but

depend on yk. obviously, the right hand sides of (22) and (23) have to be nonnegative.

now, we are interested in nding exact solutions of the above equations. it turns

out that it is preferable to use a slightly dierent approach for multi dimensional and for

lower dimensional space-times. this will allow us to obtain solutions in more general

class of metrics in the lower dimensional case. at rst, we will try to nd solutions

appropriate for application to higher dimensional backgrounds.

a simple analysis shows that we can integrate the equations (22) and (23) com-

pletely, if the metric gm n does not depend on one more coordinate, say yd1, and

we x the other coordinates on which the background depends, except yr. we prefer

to consider just this possibility in connection with further applications in mind. so,

we assume that gm n = gm n (yr, yl), (l 6= q, s, , r, d  1), and x the coordinates yl:
yl = yl
0 = constants. then the exact solution of the equations of motion and con-

straints for a null p-brane in this background is given by (9), where yl are constants

let us turn to the lower dimensional case. this separate consideration is necessary,

because in obtaining the solution (25) we have restricted the metric to be independent

on too many variables.

in four dimensions for instance, it is preferable to have a

metric, which depends at least on two of the coordinates. this gives us the possibility

to consider dierent types of black hole backgrounds for example. taking this into

account, now we would like to nd exact solutions of the dierential equations (22),

(23) for background metric, which does not depend only on yq and ys. to this end, we

set  = {} and choose the coordinates yk, (k 6= q, s, r) to be constant. then for the
remaining coordinates one obtains

(26)

the corresponding exact solution for the tensionless p-brane in the chosen background

11

is given again by (9) with (26) inserted in there.

finally, we note that for obtaining exact solutions in cosmological type backgrounds,

one can identify x0 with yr in (25) or in (26).

4 the explicit solution

in this section we are going to apply the method proposed in the previous one

for nding an explicit exact solution. we start by considering a null p-brane moving

in the solitonic ( d  1)-brane background [15]

gd1,d1 = exp (2b) r2.

d  l  1 = 1, 2, ..., d  d  2,

if we now set q = 0,  = 1, 2, ..., d  2, s = d  1, r = d, l = d + 1, ..., d  2, the
conditions (24) are fullled, the metric does not depend on yd1 and we can use the

let us restrict ourselves to the particular case of ten dimensional solitonic 5-brane

background. the corresponding values of the parameters d, d and d are d = 10,

d = 6, d = 2. taking this into account and performing the integration in (27), one

obtains the following explicit exact solution of the equations of motion and constraints

for a tensionless p-brane living in such curved space-time

in the above expressions, (z) is the eulers -function and 2f1 (a, b; c; z) is the gauss

hypergeometric function. the functions f1(a, b, b; c; w, z) and f2(a, b, b; c, c; w, z) are

dened and some of their properties are given in the appendix.

5 concluding remarks

in this paper we performed some investigations on the classical dynamics of the

null bosonic branes in curved space-times. in the second section we give the action,

show that it is reparametrization invariant and write down the equations of motion and

constraints in an arbitrary gauge. then we construct the corresponding hamiltonian

and compute the constraint algebra.

it coincides with the at space-time algebra.

the hamiltonian equations of motion are also given.

in the third section, we have

found exact solutions of the equations of motion and constraints for a null p-brane in

a particular type of d-dimensional curved background. however, the latter is general

enough to include in itself many interesting cases of string theory gravity backgrounds

in dierent dimensions (like black branes, intersecting branes and cosmological type

backgrounds). in sec. 4, we give an explicit example of exact solution for the solitonic

5-brane curved background in ten dimensions.

appendix

here we briey describe some properties of the hypergeometric functions of two

variables f1(a, b, b; c; w, z) and f2(a, b, b; c, c; w, z), which appeared in the explicit so-

lution (28) [16], [17].

14

the dening equalities for f1 and f2 are

f1(a, b, b; c; w, z) =

f2(a, b, b; c, c; w, z) =

from these denitions it is clear that the following symmetry properties hold:

f2(a, b, b; c, c; z, w) = f2(a, b, b; c, c; w, z).

some other relations between these functions with dierent arguments and parameters

the function f1 satisfy the following system of partial dierential equations

w(1  w)

the corresponding system of equations for f2 is:

let us nally write down several equalities connecting f1 and f2 with the gauss
