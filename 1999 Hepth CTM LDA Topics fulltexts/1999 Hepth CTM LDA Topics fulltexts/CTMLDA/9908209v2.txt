on supergravity in (10,2)

july 29, 2013

abstract

we consider the problem of creating locally supersymmetric theories in signature (10, 2). the
most natural algebraic starting point is the f-algebra, which is the de sitter-type (10, 2) extension
of the super-poincare algebra. we derive the corresponding geometric group curvatures and
evaluate the transformations of the associated gauge elds under the action of an innitesimal
group element. we then discuss the formation of locally supersymmetric actions using these
quantities. due to the absence of any vielbein terms there is no obvious way to dene spacetime
as such. in addition, there is also no way in which we may naturally construct an action which is
linear in the twelve dimensional curvatures. we consider the implications of the simplest possible
quadratic theories. we then investigate the relationship between the twelve dimensional theories
and lorentz signature theories in lower dimensions. we argue that in this context the process of
dimensional reduction must be replaced by that of group theoretic contraction. upon contraction
a regular spacetime emerges and we nd that the twelve dimensional curvature constraint reduces
to an einstein-type equation in which a quadratic non-linearity in the ricci scalar is suppressed
by a factor of the same magnitude as the cosmological constant. finally, we discuss the degrees
of freedom of multi-temporal variables and their relation to ultra-hyperbolic wave equations.

introduction

there have been many attempts to construct supersymmetry theories in twelve dimensions [1]. al-
though degrees of freedom counting arguments rule out standard supergravity theories in signatures
(11, 1) [2], these problems do not exist in theories with signature (10, 2), due to the existence of
majorana-weyl spinors [3]. how are we to tackle the issue of (10, 2) supergravity? although there
have been many eorts in a variety of directions based upon successful approaches in lower dimensions
none seem to work entirely satisfactorily and often involve a loss of covariance. one way to explain why
this may be the case is that the character of rigid supersymmetry in (10, 2) dimensions diers greatly
from that in the all important lorentzian eleven dimensional scenario. to see why rigid supersym-
metry is so important simply note that the basic bps solutions of the underlying eleven dimensional
superalgebra correspond exactly to the bps solutions of the eleven dimensional supergravity theory
[4]. clearly, rigid supersymmetry theories have a lot to tell us about local supergravities, which is
the viewpoint we adopt in this paper, and since the relevant (10, 2) superalgebra is entirely dierent
in structure to the eleven dimensional superalgebra there is no obvious reason that a local supersym-
metry theory in twelve dimensions should bear much of a resemblance to a traditional supergravity
theory. beginning with the algebra we present arguments as to the restrictions on the possible form
of a supergravity in twelve dimensions.

2 rigid supersymmetry in eleven and twelve dimensions

in eleven dimensions rigid supersymmetry is fully described by the following supersymmetry algebra

[q, jpq] =

in this algebra the z terms are central and j, p and q are the rotation, momentum and majorana
supersymmetry generators respectively. all indices are (10, 1). the twelve dimensional extension of
this structure is the f-algebra, which is a signature (10, 2) structure related to the osp(1,32) group,
described in [3, 5, 6], in which q is a 32 component majorana-weyl spinor

with the appropriately chosen pre-factor to obtain the correct weighting. the expressions involving
the ten index z term are given by similar formulae, although we treat it as dual to the two index
term j for all purposes except reduction. note that all the antisymmetrised expressions have weight
one so that, for example, z[1...6] = 1
6! (z123456  z213456 + . . .). we use the spinor convention that
 = c and  = c . the way in which the f-algebra reduces to the eleven dimensional
supersymmetry algebra is via a contraction of the algebra in a timelike direction, as follows.

2.1 contraction of the algebra

we now perform the operation of contraction on the theory, in which one of the timelike directions is
eectively decoupled from the system. we use the convention the indices a, b . . . run over all (10, 2)
dimensions, whereas indices p, q . . . take values in 1 . . . 11. we dene our contraction of the f-algebra
generators as follows

j0q  c1pq jpq  c2jpq z 0pqrst  c5zpqrst z pqrstu  c6zpqrstu ,

(2.4)

where the ci are some constants and the lower case letters are to be interpreted as the eleven dimen-
sional operators. we also write

the contraction process produces a continuum of consistent deformations, which contain terms qual-
itatively of the form

although any of these contractions are consistent, our aim is to reproduce the eleven dimensional
centrally extended super-poincare algebra, in which case all of the above commutators must vanish in
the innite radius limit. if we choose to identify the generators j with the eleven dimensional lorentz
rotations then the [j, j] commutator forces us to choose c2 = . to obtain additional constraints we
also look at the anticommutator term

where, as is usual, we make use of the algebraic equivalence between zp and z11p. henceforth we
shall equate z 10 and the dual of z 2; z 6 will be self dual.

3 geometry of the supersymmetry theory

now that we have evaluated the appropriate rigid supersymmetry in twelve dimensions let us try to
extend our ideas to local supersymmetry. note that the rigid bps p-branes permitted by the algebra
are classied in [6]. the basic branes which one obtains are not 2branes and 6branes, as one
might expect given 2-form and 6-form terms in the algebra and a lorentzian prejudice, but 2 + 2
and 6 + 2 dimensional solutions. we also nd a natural generalisation of the pp-wave. we suppose
that local versions of these will provide the fundamental solutions to the local supersymmetry theory.
how are we to nd this theory? since traditional methods of supergravity construction fail we look
at the geometric implications of the f-algebra. such geometric ideas have usefully been applied to
supergravities and general relativity in lower dimensions [7]. the rst step is to determine the sensible
building blocks for the theory; these are the gauge elds and corresponding curvatures derived from
the algebra.

3.1 curvatures

given some coordinate basis on some manifold we dene the gauge covariant derivatives as follows

 =   bab

 jab  c abcdef

zabcdef  
where {ta} = {jab, cabcdef , q} are the group generators, and {aa
} and the
components of the gauge eld a  aa
 ta. the generators ta of the group will be taken to be in the
adjoint representation. the indices a, b, . . . run over the group, whereas the x are some coordinates
on the base manifold m. the commutator 1 of the covariant derivative gives rise to the curvatures

(3.25)

we now discuss the construction of lagrangians from the curvatures and potentials which give rise to
invariant actions.

4 supergravities, supersymmetry and lagrangians

the goal is to construct some locally symmetric supergravity-type theory in signature (10, 2). as a
basic starting point we suppose that we must use the potentials and curvatures to create a scalar
lagrangian which gives rise to an invariant action

s = z l .

(4.26)

clearly the action is to be constructed from elements with indices of type  and a. the fact that we
require a scalar lagrangian presents us with an interesting problem: how can we create a scalar using
our basic elds? the obvious way to contract the group indices is via the killing form b of our lie
superalgebra, dened as follows

b(a, b) = str(cid:0)ad(a)ad(b)(cid:1) ,

(4.27)

for elements a, b of the lie algebra, where str denotes the operation of supertrace. the killing form
essentially provides us with a metric on the superalgebra, the components of which are given by

gab = b(ta, tb) = f d

ac f c

bd ,

(4.28)

where ta are the generators of the algebra. for the f-algebra, a calculation shows that the only
non-zero metric elements are given by

c

g =
g[a][b] = a1b1 a2b2  a1b2 a2b1
g[a][b] = 6!(cid:16)a1...a6

b1...b6 + a1...a6b1...b6(cid:17) ,

6

(4.29)

in an obvious notation. whereas we may naturally contract the group indices a with the assistance of
our new metric gab and its inverse, in order to contract on the indices ,  . . . we must introduce an
additional metric term into our theory. in ordinary gauge theories of supergravity, which are based
on poincare groups, there is a natural choice for the metric, since the momentum generators p give
rise to a potential term ea
 , which can be treated as the vielbein. this enables us to relate the metric
g on the base to the group space metric as follows

ea
 eb

 gab = g .

(4.30)

unfortunately, for the f-algebra there are no momentum-type generators and we cannot, therefore,
dene a spacetime metric in this way whilst maintaining covariance. however, after contracting the
f-algebra, we saw that we can recover the eleven dimensional superalgebra. this, of course, contains
momentum generators which may be used to generate a proper metric term. we therefore anticipate
that there does not exist a covariant (10, 2) supergravity in the usual sense of the word, but some
other geometric theory, upon contraction of which a supergravity emerges.

4.1 actions

we should now consider the possible forms of the action available to us. although einstein gravity
suggests that we write down a form of the action which is linear in the curvatures, without a vielbein
term is is not possible to write down such an action in a natural fashion because there is no way to
relate the group indices a to the base indices . we therefore look for actions which are quadratic in
the group curvatures, the simplest choice being of yangmills type

l = gra

 rb

gggab ,

(4.31)

where g is some metric on the base m , g is its determinant and gab is the metric derived from the
killing form on the group. henceforth we shall raise and lower all greek indices with the supposed
metric g, the inverse of which is to be dened through the usual relationship

gg = 1

 .

(4.32)

latin indices are raised and lowered with the use of the group space metric gab. since the killing
metric is constructed as a supertrace of the group generators, and because the curvatures transform
homogeneously under a gauge transformation, both of these actions are invariant under gauge trans-
formations. the equations of motion for each of the gauge elds are as follows2

4.2 supersymmetry transformations

we now vary the lagrangian with the supersymmetry transformations (3.24). using the fact that the
combination ggg transforms as
 (ggg) = g(cid:18) 1

gggg  g ggg  g g gg(cid:19)

(4.35)

we nd that the overall variation of the action, after much simplication, is just proportional to the
variation of the metric under supersymmetry, for any choice of g

l = g (cid:18)2r

(4.36)

4.3 the metric terms

let us now consider various possibilities for the metric eld, and the implications for the supersymme-
try of the theory. there are essentially two basic choices for the form of g : either it is a function of
the gauge elds, in which case there is some arbitrariness concerning the exact choice of the function,
or it is some additional independent eld. we discuss these scenarios in turn

1. firstly we consider the case in which the metric is an independent eld, in which case e(d) =
e(r) = 0. for this choice of g the local supersymmetry variation of the entire action vanishes.
furthermore, we obtain an additional equation of motion from the variation of the action with
respect to the eld g, similar to a quadratic einstein equation

1
4

gra

r

a = ra

 .

(4.37)

thus the lagrangian is on-shell supersymmetric. let us look at the equation of motion implied
by the metric term: taking the trace implies that the squared curvature vanishes

which implies that the g equation of motion becomes

r2  rara = 0 ,

ra

ra

 = 0 .

(4.38)

(4.39)

2. if we are to construct the metric from elds in the problem then there is one natural possibility:

use the metric obtained with the use of the killing form

a  grara(cid:17) gab ,

(4.43)

this is an interesting situation: we see that if the susy parameter  is constant then the vari-
ation is identically zero. another point is that the action is identically o-shell supersymmetric
if we work with a special class of spinors which lie on a quadratic cone such that

c = 0 ,

(4.44)

for any pair of spinors  and . this expression is equivalent to the statement that the spinors
would be majorana-weyl in signature (9, 1). in the (10, 2) signature it merely denes a new
class of spinors3. if, however, we do not wish to impose restrictions on the type of spinors in the
problem then the variation of the action becomes zero if we require that the curvatures obey the

5 reduction of multi-temporal supergravity

the main idea of this paper is that the locally supersymmetric theory in signature (10, 2) should reduce
down to a known supergravity by the process of contraction in one of the timelike group directions,
as opposed to dimensional reduction of an underlying spacetime structure. this idea is supported by
the fact that ordinary compactication does not work in quite them same way in a multi-temporal
space. the reason for this is that one must compactify on a lorentzian internal space. from a very
general algebraic viewpoint a compactication which preserves a supersymmetry requires the internal
space to be a spin manifold with special holonomy. in m -theory, which is eleven dimensional, these
holonomy groups are su (2), su (3), g2 and spin(7), corresponding to manifolds of dimension 4, 6, 7, 8
respectively [8]. to compactify a (10, 2) theory to a lorentzian theory in eleven dimensions or less
would require us to reduce on a compact spin manifold of dimension (n, 1) where n  9. there are no
such irreducible manifolds [9]. thus, reduction will simply not work in the same way as is usual, which
gives us the condence that one must abandon the idea of dimensional reduction and instead resort
to algebraic contraction. in this context is is natural to provide a new interpretation to quantities
which involve a group index corresponding to the contraction direction, as follows

b0p = ep

c0pqrst = epqrst

(5.46)

in particular we have the natural emergence of a vielbein term. furthermore, the form of the curvatures
after reduction certainly gives us the possibility of constructing an ordinary supergravity in lower
dimensions. in the scaled limit in which many of the terms in the algebra become central we nd the
following eectively eleven dimensional quantities

what of the z terms? although the two index and six index objects are originally treated equally by
the group theory, after the contraction the two index term becomes a lorentz rotation j, whereas all
other terms become central and commute with everything except j. let us look at the way in which
the curvature associated with the lorentz rotations behaves after contraction. setting the fermion and
 = 0 reduces
six-form terms to zero we see that our twelve dimensional equation of motion ra
to the following

ra

r +  = 

r2


,

(5.49)

where r is an eective eleven dimensional ricci scalar. although this equation is non-linear in r,
we see that the non-linearity is of a size inversely proportional to the magnitude of a cosmological
constant. thus a very large cosmological constant implies that the theory reduces to an only very
slightly perturbed linear equation. this is very important: if the non-linearities in the riemann tensor
were not suppressed that there would be no way in which to relate the theory to traditional gravity
theories in lower dimensions. inclusion of the other terms in the very large  limit provides us with
an equation qualitatively of the form

r + |f7|2 + ||2 + fermi +  = 0

(5.50)

where f7 is a seven-form term derived from c6
.

5.1 degrees of freedom

of course, in any study of supergravity we are crucially interested in the degrees of freedom of the
elds in question. what does this mean in the context of a theory with two timelike directions?
essentially, the number of degrees of freedom of a given variable is determined by the amount of
data needed to specify uniquely the solution to the underlying equation of motion. physical one-time
quantities propagate via wave equations, which are well understood: in order to specify the solution
to an n-dimensional wave equation uniquely we must give data on some (n  1)-dimensional cauchy
surface, which evolve along light cones. in order to specify the degrees of freedom of an (n + 2, 2)
dimensional variable we would need to understand the way in which we can solve ultra-hyperbolic wave
equations

where t1 and t2 are the two timelike directions. mathematicians are only now beginning to study in
depth the properties of multi-temporal wave equations [10]. unfortunately, it is not known how to
fully generalise the cauchy problem to multi-temporal scenarios, which is a signicant stumbling block
to the understanding of the role of many times in m-theory. although one may show that cauchy
problems or boundary value problems are ill posed in the ultra-hyperbolic scenario, this does not
mean to say that there is not some x-problem for which the solution to an ultra-hyperbolic partial
dierential equation is always uniquely determined and bounded. an understanding of this problem
would shed enormous insight into the possible role of many times in physics. however, one resolution
may be to prescribe data on a null cone, which then itself evolves along a null cone. naive counting

along these lines would suggest that a vector index would be described by the double light cone.
thus a vector index would have d  4 degrees of freedom, corresponding to the number of directions
orthogonal to the double lightcone

6 conclusion

we have discussed some of the problems associated with the formulation of a supergravity theory
in twelve dimensions. although one may always speculate on the form of such a theory, a safe
base from which to begin the exploration is the (10, 2) signature f-algebra, because this contracts to
produce the eleven dimensional supersymmetry algebra. since this twelve dimensional algebra does
not contain any momentum generators it is dicult to see how one may dene a vielbein term in the
local supersymmetry theory, and hence one cannot construct a scalar action which is linear in the
curvatures of the elds. we constructed the group theoretic curvatures from the algebra and discussed
yang-mills type actions. we showed that one obtains a rather complicated quadratic equation of
motion if the metric on the base is a function of the gauge elds or if it is an independent eld. the
main idea of the paper is that the twelve dimensional theory should reduce to a lower dimensional
supergravities not by the process of dimensional reduction but by group theoretic contraction of the
geometric theory underlying the f-algebra. this idea is supported by the fact that one cannot nd
suitable compact lorentzian manifolds of special holonomy on which to reduce in a supersymmetric
fashion. upon contraction of the theory we obtain a standard metric and riemann tensor. the non-
linearity in the riemann tensor is suppressed by a factor of the same magnitude as a cosmological
constant term. finally, we mention the very important issue of degrees of freedom of a theory with
many times. assessing correctly the appropriate degrees of freedom for such problems requires us
to understand fully the dicult question generalisation of the cauchy problem to ultra-hyperbolic
scenarios.
