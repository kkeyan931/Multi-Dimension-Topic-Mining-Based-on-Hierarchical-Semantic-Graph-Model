abstract

we analyse perturbatively, whether a at background with vanishing g-ux
in horava-witten supergravity represents a vacuum state, which is stable with re-
spect to interactions between the ten-dimensional boundaries, mediated through the
d=11 supergravity bulk elds. for this, we consider uctuations in the graviton,
gravitino and 3-form around the at background, which couple to the boundary
e8 gauge-supermultiplet. they give rise to exchange amplitudes or forces between
both boundary xed-planes. in leading order of the d=11 gravitational coupling
constant , we nd an expected trivial vanishing of all three amplitudes and thereby
stability of the at vacuum in the static limit, in which the centre-of-mass energy
s of the gauge-multiplet elds is zero. for s > 0, however, which could be re-
garded a vacuum state with excitations on the boundary, the amplitudes neither
vanish nor cancel each other, thus leading to an attractive force between the xed-
planes in the at vacuum. a ground state showing stability with regard to boundary
excitations, is therefore expected to exhibit a non-trivial metric. ten-dimensional
lorentz-invariance requires a warped geometry. finally, we extrapolate the ampli-
tudes to the case of coinciding boundaries and compare them to the ones resulting
from the weakly coupled e8  e8 heterotic string theory at low energies.

1 introduction and motivation

with the discovery of m-theory on an s1/z2-orbifold [1] and its concrete low-energy
realization as horava-witten supergravity [2], i.e. d=11 supergravity coupled to two
super yang-mills theories with e8 gauge group, living on two separate boundaries of
space-time, the vexing problem of predicting the correct magnitude for the d=4 newton-
constant gn could be addressed anew. while the heterotic string theory predicts a value
for gn which is generically too large by a factor of 400, m-theory on s1/z2 could account
for the correct value by adjusting an additional parameter, the distance d between the two
boundaries, roughly at the inverse of the gut-scale 1016 gev [3]. similar to the weak-
strong coupling relationship between the type iia-string and m-theory, it was found for
m-theory on s1/z2, that g2/3
s = d/, where gs is the heterotic string coupling constant.
since in the limit d  0 of coinciding boundaries the string coupling turns out to be weak,
it is believed that we should recover the usual heterotic string theory with gauge group
e8  e8. thus m-theory on s1/z2 has also been termed heterotic m-theory. since even
more phenomenological virtues of heterotic m-theory were discovered, e.g. it avoids the
problem of small gaugino masses [4], it is an interesting question to ask for its stability 
in particular if the boundary elds have non-vanishing energy.

since the boundaries of the theory maintain an e8 super yang-mills gauge theory,
respectively, a non-vanishing energy-momentum tensor gets induced on each of them.
because gravity couples to any energy-momentum tensor, an interaction between the
boundaries mediated by gravitons in the bulk is inevitable. this interaction should be
attractive, as can be expected from classical gravity. but furthermore the d=11 super-
gravity bulk theory allows for gravitino and 3-form exchanges, which do couple to the
boundary elds as well, due to the underlying supersymmetry. therefore we have to an-
alyze for heterotic m-theory on the proposed [1, 2] r1,9  s1/z2 space-time, whether all
these contributions cancel each other, leading to a stable conguration or not. since it is
not known how to quantize d=11 supergravity consistently, we will restrict ourselves to a
purely classical analysis of the stability problem. remembering the well-known derivation
of the complete coulomb or newton potential from tree-level photon or graviton exchange
diagrams, this should not amount to a severe restriction. noting that the construction of
horava-witten supergravity has been achieved as an expansion in powers of small 2/3,
where  is the d=11 gravitational coupling constant, we are furthermore allowed to ex-
amine the interactions between the two boundaries in linearized gravity to leading order
in  and discard higher order contributions as subleading corrections.

one may be inclined to argue that the situation should be similar to the analogous
case of an interaction between two d-branes of type ii string theory (see [5] for a review).
there the repulsion of the rr-eld compensates exactly the attraction originating from
graviton and dilaton exchange. however, in order to reach that conclusion we have to
avail ourselves of the duality between the closed-string tree-level cylinder amplitude and
the open-string 1-loop annulus diagram. only through the latter is it possible to see the

1

cancellation by appealing to jacobis aequatio identica satis abstrusa. this is in accord
with the common lore that supersymmetry leads to cancellations between fermionic and
bosonic loop-contributions (most prominently applied to the solution of the weak hierarchy
problem). in contrast to the type ii case, heterotic m-theory has been formulated only
as a classical eld theory, so far. therefore, we have to deal with genuine tree diagrams
(without any duality to some possibly vanishing loop counterpart), for which, even in
a supersymmetric theory, there is a priori no reason that they add up to zero. if one
could consistently (note that supergravity is non-renormalizable) work out the casimir-
energy at the one-loop level, then rst this could be expected to vanish on account of
the presence of supersymmetry in the bulk. second this would constitute only a small
quantum correction of order  compared to the leading order tree-level result obtained
below. for these reasons we will not explore the quantum casimir-energy further in this
paper.

it is interesting to consult the supersymmetry variations for the bulk elds. in heterotic
m-theory, the incorporation of e8 super yang-mills theories on the two orbifold xed-
planes, simultaneously requires the augmentation of the susy-variations of the bulk-elds
[2]. the additional contributions have support on the xed-planes only and are solely built
out of the boundary-elds. for the particular at minkowski background with vanishing
g-ux, which we will examine later on, the bulk contributions completely vanish, since
at space does not break any supersymmetry at all. the only non-vanishing contributions
for constant majorana-spinor  derive from the boundary elds

choosing the lorentz-gauge, the second term disappears, whereas the rst term gives
zero, when we choose p2 = p3 = p on account of the massless dirac-equation6 pa(p) = 0.
for the last two gravitino-variations, we note that

a(p)abca(p) =  a(p)abca(p) ,

(1.5)

from which we easily recognize, that the gaugino bilinear aabca also vanishes in the
limit of coinciding momenta for a and a. in kinematical language, coinciding momenta
mean a vanishing center-of-mass energy squared s = 0. hence, in this limit we expect to
nd no interaction between the boundaries, for the assumed at vacuum.

the interaction amplitudes will depend on the parameter d, representing the distance
between the two boundaries in the eleventh direction.
in case that we can still trust
horava-witten supergravity not only for large values of d but also for small values, then
according to the conjecture, the d  0 limit of the above amplitudes should correspond
to the low-energy limit of heterotic string amplitudes. consequently we will derive the
adequate string expressions describing an exchange of d=10 supergravity multiplet elds
in the low-energy limit s, t, u  1 and compare them with our m-theory amplitudes
evaluated at d = 0. naively, one would not expect complete agreement of the two sets of
amplitudes, since a large d compared to the eleven-dimensional planck-scale is a necessary
condition for the validity of the eective horava-witten supergravity.

the rest of the paper is organized as follows. in section 2 we will apply the background
eld method to horava-witten supergravity with r1,9  s1 chosen as the background1.
after gauge xing the relevant symmetries, we obtain the bulk propagators and determine
the leading order couplings of the boundary elds to the bulk supergravity elds. section
3 continues with the calculation of the amplitudes for graviton, gravitino and 3-form
exchange between the boundaries and a subsequent analysis of the stability of the theory.
in section 4 we derive the d  0 limits of the amplitudes and compare them with their
analogues from low-energy heterotic string theory. section 5 nally ends with a summary
and a conclusion.

2 expansion of horava-witten supergravity around

r1,9  s1 background

as advocated in [1],[2] we should choose r1,9s1 as our d=11 space-time manifold, where
the eleventh coordinate x11 is curled up to a circle which we parameterize by [d, d] with
d  d to be identied. furthermore we have to impose the constraint, that the elds be
invariant under the reection x11  x11. this so-called upstairs formulation, which
we shall employ here, has the advantage that one can work with a smooth manifold,
whereas in the equivalent alternative downstairs formulation one would have to deal
with a bounded manifold r1,9  s1/z2 = r1,9  [0, d] and prescribe suitable boundary
conditions. in the latter approach the boundary is given by the two codimension one xed
planes of the reection map, situated at x11 = 0 and d.

the construction of horava-witten supergravity proceeds by a power series in the
expansion parameter 2/3. to lowest order, one starts with the action of n=1, d=11
1we are working in the upstairs formulation [2], regarding the theory as an orbifold on r1,9  s 1

with a z2 symmetry imposed on the elds.

gravitational anomalies arise on the d=10 xed planes. the factorizable (trr2)3, trr2trr4
terms can be cured by a green-schwarz-like mechanism whereas the irreducible trr6 part
of the anomaly necessitates the introduction of 496 d=10 vector-supermultiplets for com-
pensation. due to the z2-symmetry they have to be compartmentalized equally to 248
multiplets on each xed plane, which singles out the e8 gauge group for the super yang-
mills theories on each boundary. altogether the d=10 boundary action for the e8 vector
supermultiplet2, comprising the gauge eld aa and the gaugino a, coupled to the bulk
supergravity in a locally supersymmetric fashion, reads [2] (i = 1, 2)

actually, on the boundary the 4-form eld strength receives an additional contribution
resulting in gabc11 = 4![acbc11] 2/3
a), where abc is a chern-
simons term depending solely on the e8 gauge eld aa
a. but since the second term
does not yield a coupling to the bulk elds, it is irrelevant for our purposes and will be
neglected in the following. furthermore the gauginos possess positive chirality 10a = a.
the gauge coupling constant  has been eliminated from (2.2) by means of the relation3
2 = 4(42)2/3. it results from demanding that on the boundary the non-vanishing
gauge variation of the chern-simons term c  g  g should be cancelled by the gauge
anomaly for the d=10 majorana-weyl gaugino a. though gauge invariance cannot be
established at the classical level, it should be valid at the quantum level, at least. the
xed plane gauge action (2.2) is the second order term in the power series expansion in
2/3. unfortunately, in the next higher order innities arise in the form of (0) terms
occuring in the lagrangean. formally, these innities cancel in verifying supersymmetry.
nevertheless, to arrive at reliable results, one is forced to truncate the action at this order
consistently. this will become important below.

from the eld-theoretic point of view, we have to look for small uctuations of the
bulk elds in order to mediate interactions between the boundary elds. this will be
achieved by using the background eld method [8], according to which we split the bulk
elds e m
m , m , cm n p and the quantum
elds f m

m , m , cm n p into a xed classical background e m
m , m , cm n p , which propagate on this background

m = e m

m + f m

e m
m = m + m
cm n p = cm n p + cm n p .

m  gm n = gm n + hm n

the action is then expanded around the background elds into a power series of the
quantum elds. the further multiplication with the d=11 gravitational coupling constant
 has been chosen to give the uctuations ordinary kinetic terms in the action. hence
the expansion in quantum elds is also one in powers of . in the following every index
will be raised or lowered by means of the background elfbein or metric.

with the chosen parameterization of the circle of radius r = d/, our background

r1,9  s1 is described locally by a at elfbein4

e m

m =  m
m .

in order not to break spontaneously the d=10 lorentz symmetry, the background grav-
itino eld m as well as the background 3-form cm n p must vanish

m = cm n p = 0 .

3originally, the relation appeared as 2 = 2(42)2/3 in [2]. we employ a further factor of 2, which
was found in [7]. since  will enter our analysis only through an overall factor, which is the same for all
amplitudes, this ambiguity will not have an inuence on our conclusions.

4for at space the curved space-time indices m, n, ... and the tangent space indices m , n , ... coincide

and need not to be distinguished subsequently.

as we will point out in the following, it is advantageous (though not necessary) if the
background elds fulll the equations of motion as is the case for our at background.

the expansion of the bulk action then proceeds as

[linear in quantum elds h, , c]

for our zero-curvature background the leading term vanishes. since the coecients of
h, , c in the 1/-term are precisely the variational derivatives of the action with respect
to the classical elds, they will vanish when the background satises the equations of
motion  as in our case. in order to extract the propagators from the quadratic part, we
have, according to the usual faddeev-popov procedure, to x all the gauge symmetries
of the quantum elds and introduce corresponding ghosts. however, since our analysis
is intended to be classical, i.e. at tree-level, we can neglect the ghost elds. n=1, d=11

1/3 [bulk-boundary interaction terms, linear in h, , c]

since the leading 1/4/3 contribution does not contain any bulk quantum eld, it cannot
contribute to the boundary-boundary interaction and is therefore of no interest to us.
the 1/1/3 terms comprise the relevant interaction terms, whereas higher order 2/3 ex-
pressions have to be skipped for two reasons. first, 2/3 terms would introduce couplings
quadratic in h, , c. either these would nally lead to loop diagrams of order 4/3, which
have to be neglected, since we restrict ourselves to a tree-level analysis. or in combination
with the couplings linear in h, , c, they would give rise to order 1 tree diagrams. these are
suppressed by a factor of 2/3 against the leading diagrams of order 1/2/3 and therefore
can be neglected, too. second, the boundary action (2.2) has been constructed only up to
order 1/4/3. the next higher order in the power series expansion in 2/3 would involve
1/2/3 terms. however, it has been argued in [2], that at this order expressions containing
(0) show up. therefore, in a consistent truncation of the theory, we have to skip these
higher contributions altogether. in the expansion around the classical background, the

ing, a consistent truncation implies throwing away all bulk-boundary interactions of order

our amplitudes we will sum over all group indices of the external boundary elds (we sum
over all possible exchange amplitudes between the two boundaries), the 5- and 4-vertices
give no contribution due to the antisymmetry of the structure constants. if, therefore, we

in order to incorporate the z2 xed point constraints and to circumvent ambiguities
arising from feynman diagrams involving majorana fermions (which allow for twice as
many wick-contractions as dirac fermions do), we choose not to work with feynman rules
in momentum space directly but to start with a space-time formulation of the s-matrix
on r1,9  s1. for a tree-level boundary-boundary interaction the s-matrix reads

where li,bound represents one of the four couplings li,bbh,li,h,li,b,li,c given in
(2.8)-(2.11). from the eleven dimensional perspective the xed point constraints enter
via delta-function sources which generate at p11-spectra in momentum space. momentum
is conserved only along the ten at directions parallel to the boundaries, whereas there is
no such conservation in the eleventh compactied direction transverse to the boundaries.
this fact is also well-known from studies of radiation o d-branes [11], [10]. therefore the
kinematic variables s, t, u of the scattering process are dened through the ten-dimensional
momenta p1, p2 of the incoming states and p3, p4 of the outgoing states as follows

(3.1)

s = (p1 + p2)2 ,

t = (p1  p3)2 ,

u = (p1  p4)2 .

as usual d=10 energy-momentum conservation implies for massless states s + t + u = 0.
the four 3-vertices (2.8)-(2.11) can be combined into ve dierent tree-diagrams which
we will now consider in detail.

here we sum over all colours a, b, c, d and physical polarizations 1, 2, 3, 4 of the in-
and out-states, since all of them add to the interaction of the two boundaries. for our
conventions concerning annihilation and creation operators see appendix a.5. when in
the next step we wick-contract creation and annihilation operators ba,2 and ba
1 with the
boundary eld operators ba
ia, we have to take into account that creation and annihilation
operators from the left-hand side of the diagram can only be contracted with left-hand
sided ba
1a(x1) operators and equally creation and annihilation operators from the right-
hand side of the diagram can only be contracted with right-hand sided ba
2a(x2) operators.
if we would allow for mixed contractions, t- and u-channel diagrams would also be
present. but these have to be excluded as they cannot arise when both hyperplanes do
not coincide. after a further trivial integration over the circle coordinates, we are thus

to utilize the previously derived at-space propagator (2.3), we have to notice that the
momentum in the compactied eleventh direction p11
m = m/r; m  z is quantized. the
radius r of the circle is related via r = d/ to the distance d between the two hyperplanes.
ensuring that we do not change the dimensions of the propagator as compared to the at
case, we have to take

in the following, we are dealing separately with the rst and the second term of this
amplitude in order to boil them down to some more enlightening expressions.

lets start with the rst term and the observation that the dirac equation6 p us(p) =

u(p)6 p = 0 gives the relations

paabcus(p) = 2p[bc]us(p) ,

us(p)abcpa = 2us(p)p[bc] .

16

if we apply them to the rst term, we obtain

us4(p4)(p3  p4)[bc]us3(p3)us2(p2)(p1  p2)[bc]us1(p1) .

by noticing that in the cms-frame p1  p2 = (0, ..., 0, e) and p3  p4 = (0, ..., 0, e sin ,
e cos ), we eventually reduce this expression to

8

4!e2

xs1,s2,s3,s4=1(cid:0) cos us4(p4)9us3(p3)us2(p2)9us1(p1)

= 4!  64s2 .

concerning the second part of the amplitude, we decompose

abc =(cid:18) a b

c d (cid:19)
c d (cid:19) (cid:18) a b

into 22 and 1616 matrices. with the explicit expression for the gaugino-spinor (a.10),
we nd

us4(p4)abcus3(p3) = ec(cid:0)sin 

us2(p2)abcus1(p1) = ecbs2s1 .

in particular, we have for our chosen representation (given in a.4) of so(1, 10) -matrices
the following description in terms of 8  8 submatrices a

0ab :
abc :

c = 1, b = 0
c = 1, b = ab,t c

0a9 :
ab9 :

c = 1, b = a
c = 1, b = 0 .

since after summation over the spin-polarizations, an antisymmetric matrix b gives a
vanishing contribution, the only non-vanishing terms for our scattering process stem from
089 and ijk; i, j, k = 1, ..., 7. hence we are able to reduce the second term to

the rst term describes an alternating sum, which does not converge and requires some
kind of regularization.
in order to understand this contribution, we will explore in a
moment the d   limit. therefore it proves useful to express the above obtained
amplitude in terms of the d=10 gravitational coupling constant (10) which is independent
of the compactication radius r or d. compactication of m-theory on an s1 of radius
r and a subsequent comparison of its einstein-hilbert term with the einstein-hilbert
term coming from the eective action of the d = 10 heterotic string (in einstein frame)
leads to the following relationship between the d=11 and the d=10 gravitational coupling
constants

2 = 2d2

since the rst part of the amplitude, consisting of the alternating sum and some d-
independent prefactors, is independent of d, we can equally well evaluate it at any d, in
particular at d  . secondly, if we consider a large radius, the dierence between two
adjacent values of p11
m becomes innitesimally small and we are allowed to replace the sum
by an integral

3.4 two further graviton exchange diagrams

to complete our discussion of all relevant tree diagrams, which contribute to a boundary-
boundary interaction, we also have to consider two further graviton exchange diagrams,
depicted in g.5. both are, after performing the wick-contractions, proportional to

us2(p2)(cid:0)cab  bac(cid:1) us1(p1) + us1(p1)(cid:0)cab  bac(cid:1) us2(p2) ,

which gives zero, if we do avail ourselves of (a.11). physically the vanishing of the
diagrams is clear, since interchanging the two gauginos of the nal state gives a minus-
sign, which cannot be compensated for by the coupling to a graviton. in the previously
analysed case of the coupling between two gauginos and the 3-form potential, the coupling
delivers an extra minus-sign under exchange of the two fermions, so that the amplitude
did not vanish in that case.

first of all, we have to determine the range of validity of (3.11)-(3.13). from the denom-
inator we recognize that singularities occur at the excitations of the kaluza-klein states
at s = m/d = p11
m ; m  z. our analysis did not cover contributions to the interac-
tion amplitudes coming from these states and only included the exchange of the massless
supergravity multiplet. therefore, the range of validity of our results is subjected to the
following constraint, given by the rst kaluza-klein excitation

0  s <


d

.

in the special case of vanishing cms-energy s = 0, each amplitude vanishes separately.
this corresponds to the situation where the boundary elds on each xed plane run in
parallel directions. in this case we have trivially no interaction between the two bound-
aries, as expected from the vanishing of the susy-variations for this kinematics. in this
special situation the at background with vanishing g-ux corresponds to a stable ground
state of the heterotic m-theory set-up. however, if there are excitations on the boundary,
by which we mean a kinematical situation showing s > 0 for the boundary-elds, we see
that pure gravity leads to an attraction (since we are always below the rst kaluza-klein
excitation energy), whereas  similar to the behaviour of the rr-forms in the analogous
d-brane case of type ii string theory  the 3-form exchange leads to a repulsion.
if
we choose the same cms-energy for all three contributions, then the attractive gravity
dominates the weaker 3-form repulsion. hence the real part of the amplitudes indicates
an instability which is caused by an attractive force trying to bring the two boundaries
closer together.

thus the at background with vanishing g-ux does not represent a stable vacuum
in the presence of arbitrary momenta of the boundary-elds. an obvious guess as to the
nature of a stable vacuum comes from the treatment of heterotic m-theory compactied
on a calabi-yau threefold [3]. there it has been shown, that with a non-vanishing g-ux
on the calabi-yau and the orbifold-direction, compactied heterotic m-theory exhibits a
warped-geometry. in view of the failure of the at vacuum to represent a stable congu-
ration, one would naively think, that the warping of the geometry should survive in the
decompactication limit. ten-dimensional poincare-invariance indeed only allows for a
non-trivial dependence on x11 and hence a warped-geometry. however, the very poincare-
invariance also requires gklm n to vanish and therefore other sources for a warping of
space-time must be taken into account.

the behaviour of the above calculated amplitudes is similar to the weakly-coupled
string-theory case in which an excited d-brane can decay into a massless closed string
state and the non-excited d-brane [11]. such a decay is also possible whenever the two
massless waves on the d-brane run in dierent directions and accordingly possess s > 0.
if the massless waves, however, run in the same direction, i.e. have s = 0, then one is
dealing with a bps state which does not decay.

curiously the gravitino exchange gives rise to an imaginary part. by inspection of
(3.6) we nd that the forward scattering amplitude t(s,  = 0) is non-vanishing. via

20

the optical theorem this would signal the opening of some inelastic channels for a decay
of an excited boundary and therefore an instability in a more drastic sense.

a last remark concerns unitarity. if we would evaluate total cross-sections with the
above amplitudes, then by integrating over the appropriate phase space, we would get at
high energies

  |t (s)|2s2  4s5 .

however, unitarity of the s-matrix would lead for spinless states to the following restriction
on partial wave amplitudes

j 

pj
s4 ,

where pj is some polynomial in j independent of s. neglecting -dependent factors which
arise for states with higher spin, we conclude, that the total cross-section  which is the
sum of all j , should decrease with increasing energy in order to obey unitarity. since
our cross-sections increase with energy, they violate unitarity. this is also plausible from
the fact, that horava-witten supergravity is not gauge invariant at the classical level
and therefore no ward-identities guarantee unitarity. however, we have to keep in mind
the restriction to the energy regime s < /d of our analysis. should it happen, that
a violation of unitarity occurs at an energy much higher than /d, we would have to
include the eects of the kaluza-klein excitations to decide, whether unitarity is violated
or obeyed.

4 comparison of the interaction amplitudes with the

weakly coupled heterotic string amplitudes

according to the conjecture made in [1], we should recover the d=10 weakly coupled het-
erotic e8e8 string theory in the limit of small r resp. d. since the amplitudes which we
have derived, so far, describe the low-energy regime, we should also compare to the anal-
ogous low-energy string amplitudes. here we have to use the expressions (3.4),(3.6),(3.9)
which contain the full angular information. in order to derive the zero radius limit, we
express all the derived amplitudes via (3.8) through the radius-independent (10) and then

so far for the m-theory amplitudes. closed string amplitudes involve a factor m2+2l
,
where m is the number of external particles and l the number of loops. hence with
four external particles it is clear, that a factor 2
(10) corresponds to string tree-amplitudes
as well. those heterotic string tree-amplitudes can be found in [12]9. the terms, which
originate there from taking traces of four e8  e8 group generators ti, must be discarded
from our comparison, since they correspond to processes where super yang-mills elds
are exchanged between the initial and nal states. what we want instead to compare
to are the amplitudes which are generated by the exchange of states of the supergravity
multiplet. since they comprise singlet-representations under the e8  e8 gauge group, we
merely encounter terms with traces over two generators, respectively. the string-theoretic
tree-amplitudes adapted to our conventions read

the factor g of [12] also contains terms describing a t- and a u-channel exchange. since
in the heterotic m-theory calculation for nite d, we get only s-channel contributions for
interactions of the boundary elds via bulk elds, our expressions for d  0 should only
be compared to this very s-channel part of the string calculation. for this reason we have
omitted the t- and u-contributions to the g-factor. the generator ti corresponds to the
ith external particle and tr is dened as the trace in the adjoint representation of e8  e8
divided by 30. the various i stand for the polarization of the ith particle.
if it is a
spinor, we have to substitute i = usi(pi), whereas for a gauge boson we have to take its
polarization i = i(pi, i).

if we compare these with (4.1),(4.3),(4.4), we recognize substantial dierences. whereas
(4.1) and (4.5) deviate mildly in their functional dependence on s, t, u, the discrepancy
between (4.4) and (4.7) is manifest. the string amplitude shows an angular dependence
but the heterotic m-theory amplitude is isotropic. the gravitino exchange amplitudes
agree in their angular dependence. nevertheless the string amplitude is real, whereas its
m-theoretic counterpart is purely imaginary.

however, such a disagreement had to be expected. generally, a low-energy description
in terms of eective supergravity is only valid at large distances resp. small curvatures.
furthermore, horava-witten supergravity is organized as a long wavelength expansion
in the parameter 2/3, assumed to be small as compared to the eleventh-dimensional
planck-scale. however, in the limit d  0 of coinciding boundaries, the long-wavelength
supergravity approximation breaks down and one cannot trust the order 2/3 expansion
any longer. therefore the eective description gives incorrect results.

24

5 summary and conclusion

our aim in this paper has been to vet whether heterotic m-theory on a at background in
its concrete low-energy formulation as horava-witten supergravity is stable. therefore,
we used the background eld method to derive interaction amplitudes between the elds
living on the boundaries. each amplitude vanishes trivially for non-excited boundaries
which corresponds to a bps ground state conguration as in the similar d-brane case.
nevertheless for a gauge excitation on the boundary with a cms-energy 0 < s < /d
below the rst kaluza-klein resonance, the gravitational attraction dominated the 3-form
repulsion, thereby giving rise to a net attractive force between the two boundaries. if one
included also the contribution from the gravitino exchange, this generated an imaginary
part for the amplitude. via the optical theorem, an even more drastic instability of
the eective theory was signalled. the consequence would be an inelastic decay of the
at vacuum set-up towards an energetically more favoured conguration. to avoid this
instability, we argued, that already for the uncompactied heterotic m-theory the vacuum
should exhibit a warped-geometry.

we briey indicated that unitarity seems to be violated by the interaction amplitudes,
which is also understandable from the fact, that the eective horava-witten description
is classically not gauge invariant. since our treatment was reliable only for energies below
the rst kaluza-klein resonance, a seeming violation of unitarity above that limit could
not be tested.

finally, we extrapolated the m-theory amplitudes to the extreme limit in which both
boundaries coincide. according to the conjecture, this is the realm where we should
recover the e8  e8 heterotic string. but a comparison with the low-energy heterotic
string amplitudes showed no complete agreement. however, this discrepancy had to be
expected, since in this limit the eective supergravity description and in particular the
long wavelength expansion of horava-witten supergravity breaks down and leads to false
results.
