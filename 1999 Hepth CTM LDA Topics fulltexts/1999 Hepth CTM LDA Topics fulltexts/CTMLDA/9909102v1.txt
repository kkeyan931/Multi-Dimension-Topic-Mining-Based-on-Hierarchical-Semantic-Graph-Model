abstract

all regular four-dimensional black holes are constructed in the theory ob-

tained by kaluza-klein reduction of ve-dimensional einstein gravity. they

are interpreted in string theory as rotating bound states of d0- and d6-branes.

conservation of angular momentum is important for the stability of the bound

states. the thermodynamics, the duality symmetries, and the near-horizon

limit are explored.

1 introduction

black holes in kaluza-klein theories have attracted tremendous attention over the

last decades. a driving force of this interest is their role as low-energy approximations

to string theory. the simplest kaluza-klein theory is obtained by starting with pure

einstein gravity in ve dimensions, and dimensionally reduce to four dimensions. the

eld content of the resulting theory is gravity, the dilaton 4, and the gauge eld a;

the lagrangian is:

l =

1

16g4 z d4x(cid:20)r  644 

1
4

e64ff (cid:21) ,

(1)

in the einstein frame. the most general stationary black hole solutions to this theory

are parametrized by the mass m, the angular momentum j, and the electric/magnetic

charges of the gauge eld, q/p . the purpose of this paper is to construct this four-

parameter family of black holes.

the electromagnetic eld created by electric and magnetic sources, charged with

respect to the same u(1) eld, carry angular momentum satisfying the universal

bound (see e.g [1] for discussions and extensive references):

nqnp

2

,

j 

(2)

where nq,p are the quantized values of the charges. thus the properties of dyonic

black holes are intimitely related to rotation. it is ultimately this feature which makes

it interesting to construct the full family of black holes, including angular momentum.

as the spin of a black hole is increased the inner and outer horizons approach

each other, eventually merging, and then exhibiting a naked singularity. very rapidly

spinning black holes are thus singular. the precise regularity bound on the angular

momentum will be determined in the course of the present investigation. it is:

j <

nqnp

2

,

(3)

in the extremal limit. this is an interesting result, in view of (2).

it shows that

the regular black holes are precisely those which cannot form from widely separated

sources each carrying either electric or magnetic charges. stated another way, the

regular black holes are prevented from decaying into constituent parts by angular

1

momentum conservation. this is signicant because the mass of the black hole exceeds

the sum of its constituent masses; so energy conservation is not sucient to stabilize

the black holes against spontaneous fragmentation.

some black holes are rendered stable in the extremal limit; so it may be reason-

able to describe them as ground states in a conformal eld theory. moving away

from extremality, the black holes exhibit thermal properties, as expected. these are

interpreted in terms of perturbations of the conformal eld theory and should remain

under control, as long as they are small. the prospects of a precise microscopic de-

scription of the black holes, even though they are not supersymmetric, is the ultimate

goal of the inquiry. however, this will be pursued elsewhere; the discussion in this

paper focusses on the classical properties of the black holes.

the present investigation is motivated by several relations to string theory. for ex-

ample, add six additional toroidally compactied dimensions, and interpret the com-

pact kaluza-klein direction as the m-theory circle. then the solutions are charged

with respect to the electric charge of d0-branes and the magnetic charge of d6-

branes, fully wrapping the six inert dimensions. thus the solutions can be interpreted

as rotating bound states of d0- and d6-branes. as discussed above, angular momen-

tum conservation implies that such bound states are stable, even though they are not

supersymmetric. the argument may explain the stability to the leading order noted
in the string theory description of the d0  d6 system [2].

for another application, recall that general four dimensional black holes in n =

4, 8 string theory are generated by black holes depending on 5 parametric charges [3].

by now it is standard to consider four of these charges [4, 5], but the fth charge is

dicult and our understanding is incomplete, even at the level of classical solutions;

for discussion see e.g [6]. the problematic fth charge parametrizes the inner product

of the electric and magnetic charge vectors; when it is absent, the four charges refer

to independent u(1)s, up to duality. in the present work there is only one u(1) eld,

so electric and magnetic charges are necessarilly parallel. in a sense, there is only the

fth charge, and therefore good opportunity to study its properties.

the paper is organized as follows. in section 2, we review the solution generating

technique, following sen [7]. the resulting solution is presented in its ve-dimensional

form, along with necessary notation. there is also a discussion of various special

2

cases, and the relation to previously known solutions. subsequently, in section 3,

the properties of the corresponding black holes in four dimensions are derived. the

various subsections are quasi-independent, each considering e.g. duality symmetries,

thermodynamic properties, dipole moments, or the near-horizon geometry.

2 the solution

in this section we review the solution generating technique, following sen [8, 7]. this

leads to the solution, of course; but it also serves to describe a specic embedding into

string theory, and to explain how a potential taub-nut singularity is avoided. sen

considered the heterotic string theory but for the present purposes it is sucient to

consider the ve dimensional vacuum sector. this truncation simplies the problem

and further gives a universal embedding, valid for all the string theories.

2.1 the solution generating technique

the idea of the solution generating technique is to note that, being interested in

stationary solutions, time can be assumed compact, for the purpose of the equations

of motions and their symmetries. this procedure yields an eective theory in three

dimensions. in the present context the compactication from ve to three dimensions

gives an so(2, 2) t-duality symmetry, with transformations acting as conjugations

on the moduli matrix:

m =   g1
bg1

g1b

g ! ,

(4)

where g and b are 2  2 matrices with t/y indices. the labels in the explicit com-
putations below are chosen so that m = diag[g1
tt , gtt] for diagonal metrics.

yy , gyy, g1

the components of the metric and the b-eld having one azimuthal index, and

the other in the t/y directions, correspond to magnetic elds in three dimensions.

they are represented as four pseudoscalar potentials  after the dualization:

 g3e23g

g 

(ml)abf (b)

  = (a) .

here l = diag[1, 1], where:

1 =   0

1

1

0! .

3

(5)

(6)

the four scalars elds  and the dilaton 3 are combined with the matrix m to form
an extended moduli matrix m, of size 6  6:
m = 


2 e23 t 
m   1
e23
2e23t 
 1
e23
2e23t  e23 + t m   1

m  e23t

e23
2e23t t  1

t m + 1


(7)

4e23(t )2

where   l. note that m is symmetric m = mt .

the group of solution generating transformations is formed by repeated appli-

cation of t-duality and s-duality; the resulting group is so(3, 3). the solution
generating matrices   so(3, 3) satisfy:

lt = l ,

(8)

where l = diag[1, 1, 1]. they leave the eective three dimensional metric invariant,
and transforms the extended moduli matrix as:

m = mt .

(9)

the solutions are required to have canonical moduli at innity; i.e. the asymptotic
moduli matrix must be mas = diag[i2,i2,i2], where i2 is the 2  2 identity
matrix. this reduces the group of solution generating transformations so(3, 3) 
so(2, 1) so(2, 1). the unbroken group includes the compact u(1) subgroup of the
sl(2, ir) s-duality group, which leaves invariant the four dimensional solution used

as starting point; so the space of solutions becomes a ve-dimensional coset:

(so(2, 1)  so(2, 1)) /so(2) .

(10)

the ve parameters are interpreted as electric/magnetic kaluza-klein charge, elec-

tric/magnetic b-eld charge, and a taub-nut parameter. removing the charges

associated with the b-eld, i.e. the fs- and ns5-charges, we are left with the diago-

nal so(2, 1) of the coset above. three generating elements of this group are:

e =

(13)

when acting on a background schwarzchild or kerr black hole, each of these trans-

formations create a solution with the designated charge. the three innitesimal

generators satisfy the so(2, 1) algebra, so together they generate a three parameter

family of solutions, parametrized by the three charges.

in the present work only regular solutions are of interest; so the taub-nut charge

must vanish. this can be cumbersome to achieve, because the transformations (11-13)

do not commute. for example, generating rst a kk-monopole using m , and then

applying the boost e, gives a solution with magnetic and elctric kk-charge, but also

taub-nut charge. the standard remedy is to further act with some t n , with the

parameter chosen to cancel the unwanted taub-nut charge. solutions constructed

this way tend to be quite unwieldy, due to the constraint of vanishing taub-nut

charge. in particular, the symmetry between electric and magnetic charges is gen-

erally obscured. the strategy in the present construction is to solve the taub-nut

constraint early on, implementing the result directly in the so(2, 1) matrix. this

leads to the two-parameter family of transformations:

 =

(14)




these matrices indeed belong to the so(2, 1) of interest and, as shown below, further

do not lead to taub-nut charge. when only electric or magnetic charges are present
the correspondence with the parameters in e and m is q = 2m cosh2  and p =
2m cosh2 , respectively; but in general there is no simple relation to the familiar

boost parameters.

2.2 the explicit computation

it follows without detailed computation from the structure of the various matrices

that the components m
23 vanish identically. this implies that the elds
carrying axion- , ns5- and fs-charges are consistently set to zero. more importantly,
the leading term in m
45 cancels, ensuring a vanishing taub-nut charge (the sub-
leading terms are related to angular momentum.) an explicit computation further

shows the relation:

m

(23)

which implies that the ve-dimensional dilaton e25 = 1. the remaining components
of m can now be interpreted consistently in terms of the ve dimensional geometry.
it can be extracted from just a few elements of m, e.g:

2.4 relation to previous work

the black holes presented above are related to many dierent families of black holes

considered in previous work. the non-rotating black holes were found by gibbons

and wiltshire [9]. they appear in a string theory context in [10, 11].

the purely electric, or the purely magnetic, rotating black holes are special cases

of the string theory black holes considered in [12, 7]. rotating black holes with both

magnetic and electric charges, but with respect to dierent u(1) elds, were found in

a string theory context in [13, 7, 14]. sen [7] further describes the construction of a

very general black hole, including the ones considered here, but found it unpractical to

carry out the details in full generality. other strategies, which could lead in principle

to the class of black holes considered here, were described in [15, 16].

the diagonal case where electric and magnetic charges are equal p = q, and

rotation is absent, is the standard reissner-nordstrom solution in einstein-maxwell

theory. in [17, 18] it was found as a string theory solution, in this form. this is pos-

sible, despite the coupling between the gauge eld and the dilaton in the lagrangean

(1), because the dual eld strength has the inverse coupling so that, when the electric

and magnetic charges are equal, it is consistent to take a constant dilaton in four

dimensions. the more general solution found here shows that this phenomenon does

not generalize to the rotating case: the standard charged, rotating kerr-newman

black hole is not a special case of the family constructed here; in particular, it is not

the diagonal case p = q.

the truncated theory dened by the lagrangian (1) is not closed under electric-

magnetic duality. one may attempt to make the lagrangian duality invariant by

including additional elds, for example the axion. the derivation of the solution given

above shows that it is consistent to set these elds to zero. however, doing so xes the

duality orbit so duality does not act as a solution generating transformation within

the family constructed here. the electric and magnetic charges therefore appear

as genuinely independent parameters in the metric. other ways to obtain electric-

magnetic duality involve the introduction of further gauge elds; for examples, see

the literature discussed above.

9

3 black holes in four dimensions

after dimensional reduction the ve dimensional black string becomes a four dimen-

sional black hole with the metric:

ds2

4,e = 

h3h1h2

(dt + b)2 +qh1h2 dr2



+ d2 +


h3

sin2 d2! .

the matter elds are the gauge eld a given in (36), and the dilaton:

e24 = s h2

h1

.

the black hole has inner and outer horizons at  = 0, i.e.:

r = m 

m2  a2 .

(43)

(44)

(45)

the outer horizon is surrounded by an ergosphere, and shields a ring singularity.

these and other features of the causal structure are similar to those of kerr black

holes, see e.g. [19]. the equations describing them are even the same, when written

in terms of the parametric variables m, a.

3.1 duality and other symmetries

after embedding into string theory the solutions are related to others by duality.

as an example, consider the embedding into type ii string theory, compactied to

four dimensions on t 6. then the electric and magnetic charges can be interpreted

as the kk-momentum and kk-monopole around any of the compact dimensions.

alternatively, as mentioned in the introduction, they are interpreted as the d0-d6

system, or any of its obvious dual pairs of d-branes.

there are much more general possibilities. the subgroup of the general e7(7) du-

ality group leaving the asymptotic minkowski space invariant is the maximal compact

subgroup su(8). a general strategy to investigate the orbit of these transformations
is to consider the central charge matrix zab of n = 8 supergravity in four dimen-
sions, transforming as an antisymmetric tensor under su(8). from general formulae,

e.g. in [20], it follows that in the present case the central charge matrix is particularly

simple, of the form:

z =  diag[, , , ] ,

10

(46)

where  = p + iq and:

 = i2 =   0

1

1 0! .

(47)

the four skew-eigenvalues of the central charge matrix are thus identical and equal

to . su(8) duality transformations can at most change the skew-eigenvalues by

phases. moreover, the overall phase must be left invariant, because the duality group

is su(8), rather than u(8). it is therefore clear that, for generic q, p , at least some

of the skew-eigenvalues of the central charge matrix remain complex throughout the

duality orbit.

the canonical family of black holes considered in the string theory literature

depends on four independent charges [4, 5]. the charges can be identied up to

duality as the skew-eigenvalues of the central charge matrix. the eigenvalues of the

central charge matrix can thus be chosen real for the standard black holes; so these

are distinct from the ones considered here, even after general dualities are taken into

account.

the einstein-maxwell theory has a u(1) duality symmetry acting on the eld

strength. in view of the various dualities in string theory it is natural to expect an

analogous symmetry in the present context. such a symmetry, exchanging electric and

magnetic charges in a continuous fashion, would multiply the four skew-eigenvalues

by an identical phase. in general, this is evidently not a symmetry, since the phases

do not multiply to unity. thus there are no continuous duality symmetries that act

within the family of solutions considered in this paper. the signicance of this result

is that the parameters p and q are genuinely independent.

acting on the skew-eigenvalues with a phase is not generally a symmetry, but

i4 = 1 so this specic value generates a discrete duality symmetry, interchanging the
electric and magnetic charges. more precisely it takes q  p , p  q, leaving the
four-dimensional geometry invariant. a more explicit route to this symmetry starts

from the truncated lagrangean (1), rewriting the maxwell eld in dual variables.
this computation also shows that 4  4 under the discrete duality.

now, let us inspect the discrete symmetries of the solutions. one symmetry has

the parametric form:

p  q

; a  a .

(48)

11

it interchanges the functions h1  h2, inverting the dilaton 4  4; and it leaves
the four dimensional geometry invariant, except for b  b. it also interchanges
the electric potential at with the magnetic potential (2) appearing in intermediate

stages of the explicit computations in section (2.2).

the discrete symmetry under time-reversal is supercially similar, yet dierent in
nature. it leaves the four dimensional geometry invariant except for b  b; again,
this takes the angular momentum j  j.
it also inverts the electric potential
at  at, but not the magnetic one a  a. this implies q  q, p  p .

the product of the two discrete symmetries described above is also a symmetry,
taking q  p , p  q, leaving j invariant. it is this combined symmetry which is
the discrete duality.

for another discussion of duality, emphasizing non-supersymmetric orbits, see [21].

3.2 the extremal limit and stability

for a given value of the conserved charges q, p, j, the lowest possible value of the
mass occurs for p, q  m, a. this three parameter family of solutions is referred to
as extremal. in the extremal limit the parametric relations (39-42) can be inverted

with the result:

2g4m = (q2/3 + p 2/3)3/2 ,

a
m

=

g4j
p q

.

(49)

(50)

note that the mass is independent of angular momentum; but nontrivial dependence

on the ratio (50) can nevertheless be retained in the extremal geometry.

a natural benchmark for the mass is the bps inequality, written in the present

units as:

2g4m  qq2 + p 2 .

(51)

this condition is always satised and cannot be saturated, when both electric and

magnetic charges are present. the extremal black holes can therefore not be super-

symmetric.

a stronger benchmark is the comparison with the energy of two widely separated

12

fragments, each carrying either the electric or the magnetic charge:

2g4m  q + p .

(52)

this inequality is also satised for all ranges of parameters. this shows that spon-

taneous fragmentation of the black hole into two parts is consistent with energy

conservation. however, as discussed in the introduction, the two constituents in the

nal state must satisfy diracs bound on the angular momentum:

j 

p q
g4

.

(53)

it is therefore only rapidly spinning black holes that are unstable towards this decay.

there are many other potential fragmentations, and angular momentum conserva-

tion may not generally rule such decays out. fragmentation in identical lumps, each

with charge assignments (q/2, p/2), is particularly worrisome, because two identi-

cally charged fragments can have vanishing angular momentum. a nonrotating black

hole with mutually prime quantized charges is not subject to this concern, but others

are. another possibility, which may be dominant in some cases, involves three bodies

in the nal state. despite these open problems, it is nevertheless interesting that the

most obvious decay channel is forbidden.

independently of these considerations a large degree of stability is expected on

entropy grounds. as discussed below, the black holes have considerable entropy,

even in the extremal limit, and any fragmentation would signicantly lower the total

entropy of the system.

the extremal family of solutions allow arbitrary value of m/a  1, so the inner
and outer horizons (45) do not in general coincide. a computation of the inner

and outer horizon area, given below, nds that those do agree, so there remains a

sense that the horizons are close in the extremal case. in general relativity, the

term extremality usually refers to a specic property of the causal structure, the

appearance of a bifurcate killing horizon. this is not the terminology used here. it

seems to require r+ = r, and so m = a. this condition is satised by a class of
solutions parametrized by q, p, m, with no further constraints (beyond q, p  2m).
it would clearly be interesting to study the causal structure in more detail, and

particularly to investigate the extremal limit closer.

13

3.3 thermodynamics

we next turn to the evaluation of the thermodynamical variables of the black hole.

the area of the black hole is determined from the four dimensional einstein metric

as:

a = z ggdd = z qh3b2

dd .

this gives the black hole entropy:

in the extremal limit the entropy simplies to:

diracs bound on the angular momentum (53) is precisely such that it forces the

expression under the square root less than or equal to zero. inspecting the solution,

this corresponds to a singularity in the geometry outside the event horizon. such

solutions are usually discarded. the remaining regular black holes are precisely the

ones that are stabilized by angular momentum conservation.

the limit m  a leads to the bizarre entropy formula:

s =

4m(p + q)
pq + 4m2 j ,

(57)

which does not simplify further.

it is simplest to compute the inverse temperature at  = 0, where the event horizon

and the ergosphere meet. here gtt = g1

rr and:

where the prime denotes dierentiation with respect to the coordinate r. the result

h =

,

4
|g
tt|

(58)

is:

h =

pq
m "pq + 4m2

p + q

+

2m2

m2  a2# .

(59)

the hawking temperature vanishes in the extremal limit p, q  m, a, and also in the
limit m  a.

14

the rotational velocity of the black hole horizon is also determined at  = 0 where:

h = 

gt
gtt

= 

1
b

.

(60)

it can be written as:

h =

2m(p + q)

pq(cid:16)2m2(p + q) + (pq + 4m2)m2  a2(cid:17)

a .

(61)

note that the product of the inverse temperature and the rotational velocity is par-

ticularly simple:

hh =

2a

m2  a2

.

it can be veried that the rst law of black hole thermodynamics:

dm = th ds + edq + m dp + dj ,

(62)

(63)

is consistent with the results above. this computation also gives the potentials con-

jugate to electric and magnetic charge:

he =

h m =



2mg4s p(q2  4m2)
2mg4s q(p2  4m2)

p + q

p + q



(p +

(q +

2m2

m2  a2
m2  a2

2m2

) ,

) .

(64)

(65)

finally, homogeneity of the thermodynamic potentials gives the generalized smarr

formula:

2s = hm  heq  hm p  2hj .

(66)

it is a good check on the computations that this formula is satised.

3.4 quantization rules

the electric and magnetic charges are quantized according to:

q = 2g4m0 nq ,

p = 2g4m6 np ,

(67)

(68)

where nq and np are integral. the mass parameters satisfy 8g4m0m6 = 1 so that:

2p q
g4

= nqnp .

15

(69)

the discussion in this paper uses (69), essentially diracs quantization rule, several

times. however, the precise quantization rules on the independent charges are less

important. it may nevertheless be useful to note that, if the electric and magnetic

objects are interpreted in string theory as d0- and d6-branes, the masses are:

m0 =

m6 =

1
lsgs

,

v6

(2)6l7

sgs

,

(70)

(71)

where the string units are dened so ls =  and v6 is the volume of the six compact
dimensions wrapped by the d6-brane.

the extremal entropy (56) can be rewritten as:

s = 2s n2
p n2
q
4  j 2 ,

(72)

using the quantization rule (69). it is interesting that this expression involves only the

quantized charges, the moduli cancel out. this is sometimes interpreted as a signal

that a clear connection to the microscopic theory is possible [22]. for supersymmetric

black holes, the cancellation of moduli is understood as a consequence of enhanced

supersymmetry at the horizon [23]. however, this result does not seem to apply in

the present circumstances.

taking the cancellation of moduli into account, the duality group is enlarged to

the full noncompact group. in n = 8 supergravity the extremal entropy formula for

the full orbit is therefore:

s = 2s 1

4

j4  j 2 ,

(73)

where the quartic invariant of e7(7) satises j4 > 0. the corresponding formula for

the orbit of extremal black holes with a supersymmetric limit is:

s = 2sj 2 

1
4

j4 ,

(74)

with j4 < 0. the analogous entropy formulae for the n = 4 theory are identical,

except that the j4 is replaced by the quartic s- and t- duality invariant.

3.5 comments on the nonextreme entropy

the family of black holes considered here are all far from extremality, and so it is

dicult to establish a rm connection with microscopic ideas for the entropy. the ex-

tremal (and diagonal) case was interpreted using the correspondence principle in [18];

for a brane-antibrane interpretation of the general nonextreme case see [11].

the purpose of this section is to apply the observations of [24, 25] in the present

case. the idea is to interpret the black hole as a state in some underlying conformal

eld theory, with the eective levels of the state as the quantities that control the

thermodynamics. now, the proposal gives a geometric determination of the levels as:

s() = 2(qnl qnr) ,

(75)

where s(+) is the usual entropy, computed from the area of the event horizon, and

s() is computed similarly, but from the area of the inner horizon. in the present

case:

s() = 2"s pq

16g2
4

(

pq + 4m2

p + q

)2  j 2 

mpq
2g4 # ,

so the prescription leads to the levels:

nl =

nr =

p + q !2
4  pq + 4m2

 j 2 ,

pq

16g2
m2pq
4g2
4

.

(76)

(77)

(78)

according to (75) we have nl > nr by convention. in black holes with a supersym-

metric limit this implies that the right movers are supersymmetric, but not the left

movers. in the present context there is no supersymmetric limit; here the convention

implies that the left movers are supersymmetric, but not the right movers.

in general, it is not known what conformal eld theory has these expressions as ef-

fective levels and no independent verication is possible. however, general principles

of conformal eld theories nevertheless suce for some consistency checks. an impor-

tant requirement is that the dierence of the levels must be an integer, by modular

invariance. in the present case a simple computation gives:

nl  nr =

q2p 2

4  j 2 =
g2

1
4

n2
qn2

p  j 2 .

(79)

17

this is indeed an integer, for all values of the charges and the angular momentum.

note that this result is quite delicate: j may be half-integer and nqnp may be odd,

but the angular momentum quantization rules for dyons ensure that these possibilities

are correlated so that neither happen, or both happen at once. this is precisely what

is needed.

in conclusion, we nd that nr  nl is integral, conrming a rule noted in many
previous examples. this may be an indiction that both nr and nl are levels in some

conformal eld theory.

3.6 the magnetic dipole moment

the magnetic dipole moment is a good indicator of the interplay between the angular

momentum and the electric and magnetic charges. it can also be useful in establishing

the connection to various microscopic models, see e.g. [26, 27, 28].

the magnetic dipole moment can be read o from the gauge potential a, given in

(36). the coecient is determined by the precise analogy with the relation between

angular momentum and the eective gauge potential b. this procedure gives:

a natural benchmark for the electric dipole moment is the classical value:

(80)

(81)

(82)

(83)

p3(q2  4m2)

(p + q)

a
4m

.

 = vuut
= vuut

0 =

qj
2m

(pq + 4m)q

a
4m

.

p(q2  4m2)

(p + q)5

the gyromagnetic ratio g, dened through  = g0, becomes:

g =

p(p + q)2

q(pq + 4m2)

.

to interpret this formula, consider some special cases.

the purely electric black hole has p = 2m and so the gyromagnetic ratio:

g =

q + 2m

q

.

this agrees with previous results [12, 7]. the function decreases monotonically from

diracs quantum value g = 2, in the limit of vanishing electric charge (q = 2m), to

the classical value g = 1, for very large charge. the large charge limit is extreme and

18

the result can be compared succesfully with our microscopic understanding [28]. the

appearance of diracs value in a natural limit of parameter space is intriguing, and

reminiscent of the fact that this also happens for kerr-newman black holes. as in

that case, it is not clear why diracs value should appear.

a more illuminating special case may be that of vanishing electric charge p = 2m,

giving:

g =

p
2m

(

p
2m

+ 1) .

(84)

the gyromagnetic ratio is always larger that diracs value g = 2, obtained in the limit

of vanishing magnetic charge q = 2m. it increases monotonically with the magnetic

charge, with no upper bound. thus, the rotating magnetic background is very ecient

at creating an magnetic dipole moment. this property suggests some sort of phase

separation of the microscopic constituents; however, the details are puzzling.
as a last special case, consider the general extreme limit p, q  m where:

g =

(q + p)2

q2

2

= 
1 +  p

q!2/3


(85)

this attains the classical value for purely electric black holes, and increases without

bound as the magnetic charge is turned on and becomes large. similar qualitative

behavior was noticed in [14], but for black holes that are not obviously related to the

present ones. the full function (85) characterizes properties of extremal black holes,

and may be a good target for a microscopic analysis.

the consideration of the electric dipole moment is completely parallel to that of

the magnetic dipole moment. here one starts with the magnetic potentials, already

computed in section (2.2). the resulting expressions for the magnetic variables can
be found from the corresponding electric ones, via the interchange of variables p  q.
the associated discussion is therefore analogous.

3.7 the near-horizon geometry

in some cases the ads/cft correspondence [29] oers a direct avenue from the near-

horizon geometry of black holes to aspects of the underlying microscopic theory. as

a rst step in this strategy, consider the nonrotating black holes a = 0, and take the

19

limit p, q  r, m. the metric becomes:

ds2

5 =

q
p

dy2 

2(p + q)

q2p

(r2  2mr)dt2 +

p2q

2(p + q)

(

dr2

r2  2mr

+ d2

2) .

(86)

the radius of the compact dimension is constant, so the geometry is eectively four-
dimensional. in fact, for r  m it is precisely ads2  s2, the near-horizon limit of
extreme reissner-nordstrom black holes. a general value of m parametrizes a defor-

mation away from the ads2 limit which preserves the asymptotic behavior. these

results are promising, but the conformal quantum mechanics dual to ads2 spaces is

not well understood [30], and the decoupling limit which denes it as a theory without

gravity is more subtle than for other ads-spaces [31].

another decoupling limit for the d0/d6 system was considered in [32]. in this

limit the eective near-horizon geometry is the ve-dimensional kerr black hole. the
precise relation with the ads2  s2 geometry is not clear.

when the rotational parameter is included the decoupling limit has p, q  r, m, a.

in this limit the geometry is (31) with:

h1 =

h2 =

bt =

p2q

q2p

2(p + q)  1 
2(p + q)  1 +
p3q3
2(p + q)

m + a cos 

,

(87)

(88)

(89)

(91)

and h3,  retained in full. the parameter a/m must be less than unity for the

geometry to be regular, in agreement with the discussion in section 3.2. the scale of

the compact dimension is set by h2/h1 and is independent of r, but dependent of .
thus the compact direction eectively becomes part of the angular s2.

the azimuthal coordinate mixes with the time coordinate, as expected for rotating
spacetimes. however, g,t  r for large r so the ads2  s2 geometry is not recovered
asymptotically. to interpret this result, recall that rotation similarly modies black
holes with near-horizon geometry ads3  s2 by mixing the ads3 with the s2, but in
this case the asymptotic geometry is unaected by the rotation [33]. the eld theory

20

interpretation is that the rotational parameter characterizes a specic excitation,

rather than a deformation of the theory. in the present case we reach the opposite

conclusion: the deformation due to rotation is so large that it modies the dual theory.

one may take further limits between the small parameters, in an attempt to nd
the geometry corresponding to the vacuum of the dual cft. the relation r  m, a
is natural because it retains the ratio a/m characterizing the rotation. however, no

special simplication seems to occur in the limit.
