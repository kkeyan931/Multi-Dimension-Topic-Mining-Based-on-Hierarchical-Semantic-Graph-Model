abstract

we develop a general framework for quantum eld theory on non-
commutative spaces, i.e., spaces with quantum group symmetry. we
use the path integral approach to obtain expressions for n-point func-
tions. perturbation theory leads us to generalised feynman diagrams
which are braided, i.e., they have non-trivial over- and under-crossings.
we demonstrate the power of our approach by applying it to 4-theory
on the quantum 2-sphere. we nd that the basic divergent diagram of
the theory is regularised.

introduction

the idea that space-time might not be accurately described by ordinary
geometry was expressed already a long time ago.
it was then motivated
by the problems encountered in dealing with the divergencies of quantum
eld theories. an early suggestion was that spatial coordinates might in fact
be noncommuting observables [1]. for a long time development has been
hampered by the lack of proper mathematical tools. only with the advent
of noncommutative geometry and quantum groups have such ideas taken
a more concrete form. quantum groups emerged in fact from the theory
of integrable models in physics and were connected from the beginning to
the idea of noncommutative symmetries in physical systems [2][3][4]. it was
then also suggested that they might play a role in physics at very short dis-
tances [5]. the idea that quantum symmetry or noncommutativity might
serve as a regulator for quantum eld theories was emphasised in [6] and [7].
the persistent inability to unite quantum eld theory with gravity is a main
motivation behind such considerations. in this context it is interesting to
note that noncommutative geometric structures are emerging also in string
theory [8]. despite progress in describing various physical models on non-
commutative spaces (see e.g. [9][10][11][12]), a general consistent approach
for doing this has been lacking. we aim at taking a step in this direction by
providing a framework for doing quantum eld theory on noncommutative
spaces.

the most basic ingredient of a quantum eld theory is in our view the
space of elds together with the group of symmetries acting on it. gen-
eralising to the noncommutative context this means that we have a vector
space of elds coacted upon by a quantum group (which we take to mean
coquasitriangular hopf algebra) of symmetries. thus, the space of elds
becomes an object in the braided category of comodules of the quantum
group. we think that this braiding rather than the noncommutativity it-
self is crucial when intending to regularise a conventional theory. (this is
also supported by our results in section 5.) our approach in the spirit of
braided geometry [13, chapter 10] is based on gaussian path integrals and
the usual perturbation theory leading here to braided analogues of feynman
diagrams. to simplify the discussion we use the conventions of euclidean
quantum eld theory, i.e., strictly speaking we are doing statistical eld the-
ory. also, we only consider scalar quantum eld theory in this paper. thus,
conventionally the space of elds is just the algebra of functions on space-
time and the symmetry group is the group of isometries of space-time. for a
rigourous treatment we also require the quantum group of symmetries to be
cosemisimple corresponding to compactness in the commutative case. how-
ever, when aiming to regularise uv-divergencies this is not a disadvantage,
since they should not be aected by the global properties of a space.

we start out in section 2 by dening gaussian integrals on braided spaces

2

based on [14]. this provides us with the free n-point functions of a braided
quantum eld theory. developing perturbation theory in a manner similar to
standard quantum eld theory we obtain the braided analogues of feynman
diagrams. it turns out that symmetry factors of ordinary feynman diagrams
get resolved into dierent (and not necessarily equivalent) diagrams in the
braided case.

in section 3 we consider the case where the space of elds is a quantum
homogeneous space under the symmetry quantum group. inspired by the
conventional commutative case this gives us a more compact description
of n-point functions. furthermore, it allows for simplications in braided
feynman diagrams.

while our approach is somewhat formal up to this point, section 4 intro-
duces a context that allows us to work rigourously in innite dimensions. we
need a further assumption to do this, which corresponds in the commutative
case to the space-time being compact.

finally, in section 5 we deliver on the promise to perform q-regularization
within braided quantum eld theory. to this end we consider 4-theory on
the standard quantum 2-sphere [15]. we make use of all the machinery
developed up to this point to show that the only basic divergence of 4-
theory in two dimensions, the tadpole diagram, becomes nite at q > 1. we
identify the divergence in q-space and suggest that it would not depend on
the conventional degree of divergence.

by a quantum group we generally mean a hopf algebra (see e.g. [13]).
when talking about a quantum group of symmetries we mean a hopf algebra
equipped with a coquasitriangular structure. we denote the coaction by ,
the counit by , and the antipode by s. we use sweedlers notation [16]
 a = a(1)  a(2), etc., with summation implied. we apply the same notation
to hopf algebras in braided categories.

while working over a general eld k in sections 24 we specialise to the

complex numbers in section 5.

2 formal braided quantum field theory

2.1 braided gaussian integration

braided categories arise as the categories of modules or comodules over
quantum groups (hopf algebras) with quasitriangular respectively coquasi-
triangular structure (see e.g. [13]). the latter case will be the one of interest
to us later. we consider rigid braided categories, where we have for every
object x a dual object x  and morphisms ev : x  x   k (evaluation)
and coev : k  x   x (coevaluation) that compose to the identity in the
obvious ways. although rigidity implies nite dimensionality, we shall see
later (section 4) how we can deal with innite dimensional objects. the
dierentiation and gaussian integration on braided spaces that we require

3

were developed by majid [17] and kempf and majid [14] in an r-matrix
setting. however, we need a more abstract and basis free formulation of
their formalism so that we redevelop the notions here.

suppose we have some (rigid) braided category b and a vector space
x  b. essentially, we want to dene the (normalised) integral of functions
 in the coordinate ring on x multiplied by a gaussian weight function
w, i.e., we want to dene

z() := r w
r w

.

(1)

first, we need to specify this coordinate ring. we identify the dual space
x   b as the space of coordinate functions on x and consider the free
unital tensor algebra over x ,

mn=0

cx  :=

x n, with x 0 := 1 and x n := x       x 

,

|

n times

{z

}

where 1 is the one-dimensional space generated by the identity. it naturally
has the structure of a braided hopf algebra [13, chapter 10] via

 a = a  1 + 1  a,

(a) = 0,

s a = a

make the notion of coordinate ring more precise, one could perhaps con-

for a  x  and , , s extend to cx  as braided (anti-)algebra maps. to
sider a kind of symmetrised quotient of cx  in analogy to the observation

that coordinates commute in ordinary geometry. however, the following
discussion is independent of introducing additional homogeneous relations.
thus, we shall not consider any here.

the next step is the introduction of dierentials [17]. the space of
coordinate dierentials should be dual to the space x  of coordinate func-
tions. we just take x itself and dene dierentiation on x  by the pairing
ev : x  x   k in b. to extend dierentiation to the whole coordinate

ring cx , we note that the coproduct encodes coordinate translation. this

leads to the natural denition that

di := (bev  id)  (id  ) : x  cx   cx 

is dierentiation on cx , where bev is the trivial extension of ev to xcx   k,
i.e., bev |xx n = 0 for n 6= 1. we also use the more intuitive notation
(a) := di(  a) for   x and a  cx . let   x and ,   cx . the
denition of bev gives at once

bev(  ) = bev(  ) () + bev(  ) ().

4

using that the coproduct is a braided algebra map, we obtain the braided
leibnitz rule

() = () + 1(  )().

(2)

iteration yields

() = (ev  idn2)(  [n] ),

where n is the degree of  and

[n] := idn +  idn2 +    + n2,1  id +n1,1

is a braided integer. we adopt the convention of writing n,m for the braiding
between x n and x m (respectively 1

n,m for the inverse braiding).

as in [14] we view the gaussian weight w formally as an element of cx 

and dene its dierentiation via an isomorphism

 : x   x

so that

(w) = 1()w

for   x.

(3)

1 should be thought of as dening a braided analogue of a positive denite
form on x . our denitions so far allow us to evaluate integrals of the form

(1) up to termsr (w) with   x,   cx , which we identify as integrals

of total dierentials and equate to zero.

to express the integral (1) in a convenient way we dene alternative

braided integers as

[n]

 := idn + idn2 1 +    + 1

1,n1

and set

[2n  1]

!! := ([1]

  id2n1)([3]

  id2n3)    ([2n  1]

  id).

proposition 2.1.

z |x  2 = ev   (id ),

z |x 2n = (z |x  2)n  [2n  1]

!!, z |x  2n1 = 0,

n  n.

proof. for   cx  and a  x  we have

aw =  di((a)  w) =  di((  (a))w) + (di (  (a)))w

using the dierential property (3) of w and the braided leibnitz rule (2).
applying z, we can ignore the total dierential and obtain

z(a) = z(di (  (a))).

(4)

this gives us immediately

z(a) = 0

and

z(ab) = ev (a  (b))

5

for b  x . we rewrite (4) to nd

z |x n = z |x  n2  di (  idn1)  n1,1

= z |x  n2  (ev  idn2)  (  [n  1])  n1,1
= (ev  z |x  n2)  (  [n  1])  n1,1
= (ev  z |x  n2)  n1,1  ([n  1]  )
= (z |x 2  z |x  n2)  (id n2,1)  ([n  1]  id)
= (z |x n2  z |x 2)  1
= (z |x n2  z |x 2)  (1

2,n2  (id n2,1)  ([n  1]  id)
1,n2  id)  ([n  1]  id),

which gives us a recursive denition of z leading to the formulas stated.

another version of the braided integers

[n]

 := idn +1  idn2 +    + 1

1,n1

with [2n  1]

!! := (id [2n  1]

)    (id2n3 [3]

)(id2n1 [1]
)

serves to formulate the dual of the proposition.

corollary 2.2. let z k  x k denote the dual of z |x k. then

z 2n = [2n  1]

z 2 =   (  id)  coev,
!! (z 2)n, z 2n1 = 0,

n  n,

proof. this is obtained from proposition 2.1 by reversing of arrows or equiv-
alently by turning diagrams upside down in the diagrammatic language of
braided categories.

2.2 braided path integrals

as emphasised in the introduction, the main basic ingredient of standard
quantum eld theory in our view is the space of elds together with the
group of symmetries acting on it.
in the setting of quantum groups this
means that we have a quantum group (a coquasitriangular hopf algebra) a
of symmetries and a braided space of elds x on which a coacts. the aim is
to construct the (analogues of) perturbative n-point functions. we use the
conventions of euclidean quantum eld theory and only consider one scalar
eld. thus, in the commutative case, x would be the space of functions
on a riemannian space-time manifold m and a would be the lie group of
isometries of m .

the n-point function in standard quantum eld theory evaluated at

(x1, . . . , xn) is given by the path integral

h(x1)    (xn)i = r d (x1)    (xn)es()

r d es()

6

with action s. this is really the normalised integral over x of the functional
 7 (x1)    (xn) with weight w() = es().

let us deal with the free non-interacting theory rst. the path integral
is then a gaussian integral and we are for the general braided case in the
framework of section 2.1. disregarding the precise form of w for the moment,
we already see that the value of the path integral is given by proposition 2.1.
dually, the (unevaluated) n-point function itself is the element z n of x n
given by corollary 2.2. it tells us in particular how the n-point functions
are obtained from the 2-point function. thus, it is the braided version of
wicks theorem, to which it reduces for the case of trivial braiding.

let  be some dierential with respect to the elds. the denition of 

in section 2.1 corresponds to

((es0 ))() = (1())()es0(),

where s0 denotes the free action. thus we nd (1())() = (s0)().
the free action in standard euclidean (real) scalar eld theory is

s0() =

dx (x)(m2  m )(x),

1

2zm

where m is the laplace operator on m and m is the mass of the eld.
dene l := m2  m . let {i} be a basis of x and {
i } a dual basis.
denote the dierential with respect to i by i. we have

(is0)() =zm

dx (x)li(x) =xk

k()zm



dx k(x)li(x).

rewriting this in the terminology of section 2.1 we get

1 =(cid:18)id zm(cid:19)  (id )  (coev l),

which we take as the dening equation for .

(5)

to evaluate interacting n-point functions, we use essentially the same
perturbative techniques as in standard quantum eld theory. if s = s0 +
sint with coupling constant , we expand

h(x1)    (xn)i = r d (x1)    (xn)(1  sint() + . . . )es0()

r d (1  sint() + . . . )es0()

we write dually (assume sint is of degree k)

z int

n =

z n (idn sint)(z n+k) + 1

1  sint(z k) + 1

2 2(idn sint  sint)(z n+2k) + . . .
2 2(sint  sint)(z 2k) + . . .

for the interacting n-point function in the general braided case. vacuum
diagrams cancel as usual. note that we have used the ordinary exponential
expansion for the interaction and not, say, a certain braided version. the
latter might be more natural if, e.g., one wants to look at identities between
diagrams of dierent order. however, we shall not consider this here.

2.3 braided feynman diagrams

we are now ready to generalise feynman diagrams to our braided setting.
to do this we use and modify the diagrammatic language of braided cate-
gories appropriately:

 an n-point function is a map k  x      x (n-fold). thus, its
diagram is closed to the top and ends in n strands on the bottom. any
strand represents an element of x.

 the free 2-point function z 2 : k  x  x is represented by an arch

(see gure 1.a). (this would usually represent the coevaluation.)

 an n-leg vertex is a map x      x  k.

it is represented by
n strands joining in a dot (see gure 1.b). notice that the order of
incoming strands matters.

 any feynman diagram is made just out of free 2-point functions, (pos-
sibly dierent kinds of) vertices and strands connecting them or ending
at the bottom.

otherwise the usual rules of braided diagrammatics apply.

the diagrams for the free 2n-point functions can be read o immediately
from corollary 2.2. figure 2 shows for example the free 4-point function and
gure 3 the free 6-point function. for the interacting n-point functions we
use formula (6) to obtain the diagrams. sint gives us the vertices. consider
for example the 2-point function in 4-theory. to order  we get

z int

2 = z 2 (cid:0)(id2 sint)(z 6)  z 2 sint(z 4)(cid:1) + o(2).

(7)

sint is just the map 1  2  3  4 7r 1234. to obtain the diagrams

at order  we start by drawing the free 6-point function (gure 3) and attach
to the 4 rightmost strands of each diagram a 4-leg vertex (gure 1.b). those
diagrams are generated by the rst term in brackets of (7). we realize
that the rst three of our diagrams are vacuum diagrams which are exactly
cancelled by the second term in the brackets. the remaining 12 diagrams
are shown in gure 4. in standard quantum eld theory they all correspond
to the same diagram: the tadpole diagram (see gure 5, we use a black dot to
distinguish from the braided case). however, not all of them are necessarily
dierent, as we shall see in section 3.2.

3 braided qft on homogeneous spaces

in standard quantum eld theory xing one point of an n-point function
still allows to recover the whole n-point function. thus, we can reduce an
n-point function to a function of just n  1 variables. this is simply due

to the fact that any n-point function is invariant under the isometry group
g of the space-time m and g acts transitively on m .
in this case m is
a homogenous space under g and we can make the above statement more
precise in the following way.

lemma 3.1. let g be a group and k a subgroup of g. for any n  n
there is an isomorphism of coset spaces

n : (k\g      k\g

)/g = (k\g      k\g

)/k

given by n : [a1, . . . , an] 7 [a1a1
n ] for ai  k\g. its inverse
is given by 1
: [b1, . . . , bn1] 7 [b1, . . . , bn1, e] for bi  k\g, where e
n
denotes the equivalence class of the identity in k\g. if g is a topological
group (i.e., it is a topological space and multiplication and inversion are
continuous) then equipping the coset spaces with the induced topologies makes
n into a homeomorphism.

3.1 quantum homogeneous spaces

lemma 3.1 generalises to the quantum group case. to see this we rst recall
the notion of a quantum homogeneous space.

suppose we have two hopf algebras a and h together with a hopf
algebra surjection  : a  h. this induces coactions l = (  id) and
r = (id ) of h on a, making a into a left and right h-comodule algebra.
dene ha to be the left h-invariant subalgebra of a, i.e., ha = {a 
a|l(a) = 1  a}. we have  ha  ha  a since (l  id)   = (id  ) 
l. this makes ha into a right a-comodule (and h-comodule) algebra.
observe also that (a) = (a)1 for a  ha. ha is called a right (quantum)
homogeneous space. dene the left homogenous space ah correspondingly.
due to the anticoalgebra property of the antipode we nd s ha  ah and
s ah  ha. if the antipode is invertible the inclusions become equalities.

proposition 3.2. in the above setting with invertible antipode the map

n : (ha      ha

)a  (ha      ha

)h

|

n times

{z

}

|

n1 times

{z

given by n = (idn1  ) for n  n is an isomorphism.
its inverse is
(idn1  s)  n1, where n1 is the right coaction of a on ha extended to
the (n  1)-fold tensor product.

proof. let a1      an be an element of (ha      ha)a. in particular

a1

(1)      an

(1)  a1

(2)    an

(2) = a1      an  1.

11

applying the antipode to the last component and multiplying with the n-th
component we obtain

a1

(1)      an1

(1)  (an) s(a1

(2)    an1

(2)) = a1      an.

(8)

thus, (idn1  s)  n1  (idn1  ) is the identity on (ha      ha)a.
on the other hand applying the inverse antipode and then  to the last
component of (8) we get

a1

(1)      an1

(1)  (an)(a1

(2)    an1

(2)) = a1      an1  (an)1.

this is to say that a1      an1 (an) is indeed right h-invariant.

conversely, it is clear that (idn1  )  (idn1  s)  n1 = (idn1  ) 
n1 is the identity. now take b1      bn1 in (ha      ha)h . its image
under n1 is

b1

(1)      bn1

(1)  b1

(2)    bn1

(2).

(9)

applying  to the last component we get

b1

(1)      bn1

(1)  (b1

(2)    bn1

(2)) = b1      bn1  1

by right h-invariance. applying n1  id we arrive at

b1

(1)      bn1
= b1

(2)    bn1
(1)  b1
(1)      bn1

(2)  (b1
(1)  b1

(3)    bn1

(3))

(2)    bn1

(2)  1.

we observe that this is the same as applying (idn1 r) to (9). thus, the
last component of (9) lives in ah and the application of the antipode sends
it to ha as required. that the result is right a-invariant is also clear by the
dening property of the antipode.

to make use of the result we assume our space x of elds to be a (quan-
tum) homogenous space under the (quantum) group (coquasitriangular hopf
algebra) a of symmetries. (note that coquasitriangularity implies invertibil-
ity of the antipode.) i.e., together with a we have another hopf algebra h
and a hopf algebra surjection a  h. we then assume that the algebra of
elds is the right homogeneous space x = ha living in the braided category
ma of right a-comodules.

3.2 diagrammatic techniques

proposition 3.2, to which we shall refer as invariant reduction, is not only
useful to express n-point functions in a more compact way, but can also be
applied in the evaluation of braided feynman diagrams. for this we note
that any horizontal cut of a braided feynman diagram lives in some tensor
power of x (since the only allowed strand lives in x) and is invariant (since
the diagram is closed at the top). thus, we can apply invariant reduction
to it. we shall give three examples for this.

12

vertex evaluation. consider the evaluation of an n-leg vertex (the hori-
zontal slice of an invariant diagram depicted in gure 6) with incoming
elements a1      ak+n. by invariant reduction this can be expressed
in two ways,

a1      akz ak+1    ak+n
= a1(1)      ak (1) (ak+1)    (ak+n)z s(a1(2)    ak (2))

depending on the circumstances each side might be easier to evaluate.

loop extraction. assume that the integral on ha is normalised, r 1 =

1. consider the diagram in gure 7 (left-hand side). it is obviously
invariant. thus, the single outgoing strand carries a multiple of the
identity and we can replace it by the integral followed by the identity
element (gure 7, right-hand side).

loop separation. we assume further that the coquasitriangular structure

is trivial on hah in the sense

r(a  b) = (a) (b)

if a  hah or b  hah .

(10)

consider now the diagram in gure 8 (left-hand side) as a horizontal
slice of an invariant diagram. according to invariant reduction we
apply the counit to the rightmost outgoing strand. this makes the
braiding trivial due to the assumed property of r. we can push the
counit up to each of the joining strands and disentangle them. then
proceeding as in the previous example leads to the diagram in gure 8
(right-hand side). note that this works the same way for an under-
crossing.

let us come back to the 2-point function of 4 theory that we considered

at the end of section 2.3. assuming r 1 = 1 and property (10) we can

use loop extraction and loop separation to simplify the order 1 diagrams of
gure 4 considerably. the result is shown in gure 9. instead of 12 dierent
diagrams we only have 2 dierent and much simpler diagrams, each with a
multiplicity of 6.

4 braided qft on compact spaces

4.1 braided spaces of innite dimension

up to now we have developed our approach on a formal level insofar, that we
have not addressed the question how an innite dimensional space (of elds)
can be treated in a braided category. this is certainly necessary if we want

to do quantum eld theory (statistical eld theory), i.e., deal with innitely
many degrees of freedom. an obvious problem is the denition of the co-
evaluation. it seems that we need at least a completed tensor product for
this. however, instead of introducing heavy functional analytic machinery,
we can stick with our algebraic approach given a further assumption.

let us assume that the space of (regular) elds x decomposes into a

direct sumli xi of countably many nite dimensional comodules under the

symmetry quantum group a. this corresponds roughly to the classical case
of the space-time manifold being compact. in particular, it is the case if the
symmetry quantum group a is cosemisimple (or classically the lie group
of symmetries is compact, see section 4.2 below). denote the projection
x  xi by i.

we now allow arbitrary sums of elements in x given that any projection
i annihilates all but nitely many summands. similarly, we allow innite
sums in the n-fold tensor product x n with the restriction that any projection
i1   in yields a nite sum. to dene the dual of x, we take the dual of
i . for each component xi we have an evaluation
in
i ) and coev =

each xi and set x  =li x 
the usual way. we then formally dene ev = pi evi (i   
pi coevi.

our denition is invariant under coactions of a as it should be, since the
projections i commute with the coaction of a. in particular, it is invariant
under braidings.

4.2 cosemisimplicity and peter-weyl decomposition

we describe a context in which all comodules over a hopf algebra decompose
into nite dimensional (and even simple) pieces. the discussion here uses
results of [16] but is more in the spirit of [18, ii.9].

let c be a coalgebra, v a simple right c-comodule (i.e. v has no proper
subcomodules) with coaction  : v  v  c.
in particular, v is nite
dimensional. the dual space v  is canonically a (simple) left c-comodule.
denote a basis of v by {ei}, the dual basis of v  by {f i}.
identify the
endomorphism algebra on v end v = v  v  via (ei  f j)(ek  f l) = j
k(ei 
f l). we denote the dual coalgebra by (end v ) and identify (end v ) =

v   v via (f i  ej) =pk(f i  ek)  (f k  ej).

now consider the map (end v )  c given by f i ej 7 (f i id)(ej ).
it is an injective (since v is simple) coalgebra map. we extend this to the
direct sum of all inequivalent simple comodules. the resulting map

mv

(end v )  c

is a coalgebra injection. it is an isomorphism of coalgebras if and only if
all c-comodules are semisimple (i.e. they are direct sums of simple ones) or

15

equivalently if c is semisimple (i.e. it is a direct sum of simple coalgebras).
assume now that a is a cosemisimple hopf algebra, i.e., a is semisimple

as a coalgebra. we write the above decomposition as

a =mv

(v   v ).

(11)

it is also referred to as the peter-weyl decomposition, in analogy to the cor-
responding decomposition of the algebra of regular functions on a compact
lie group. there is a unique normalised left- and right-invariant integral
(haar functional) on c, given by the induced projection to the unit element
in c. note also that the antipode is invertible.

consider now a second hopf algebra h with a hopf algebra surjection
 : a  h. this induces a coaction of h on each a-comodule. for the
right quantum homogenous space we then have

ha =mv

(h(v )  v )

(12)

as right h-comodules.

5 4-theory on the quantum 2-sphere

in accordance with the motivation of braided quantum eld theory as a
way of regularising standard quantum eld theory, we replace lie groups of
symmetries by corresponding parametric deformations. in order to have a
well dened theory in the sense of section 4 we make use of the peter-weyl
decomposition and thus restrict to compact lie groups. a natural choice
are the standard q-deformations of lie groups with compact -structure. we
specialise to k = c, although the discussion of the free action in section 2.2
was in the spirit of real-valued scalar eld theory. this is necessary since
the standard q-deformations viewed as deformations of complexications of
compact lie groups do not restrict to real subalgebras for q 6= 1. however,
viewing q-deformation purely as a mathematical tool we can always restrict
to r when considering physical quantities living at q = 1.

in the following we consider perturbative 4-theory on the quantum 2-
sphere as an example of a quantum eld theory on a braided space. (see
e.g. [19] for a treatment of standard 4-theory.) we demonstrate that the
basic divergence of the theory, the tadpole diagram (gure 5), becomes nite
for q > 1. our hopf algebra of symmetries is suq(2) under which s2
q is a
homogeneous space as a right comodule. (we adopt the convention to denote
the hopf algebra of regular functions by the name of the (quantum) group
or space.)

16

5.1 the decomposition of suq(2) and s2
q

to prepare the ground we need to recall the construction of s2
q as a quantum
homogeneous space under suq(2) and the peter-weyl decomposition of the
latter [20][21]. this will enable us to apply the machinery of the previous
sections.

recall that suq(2) is the compact real form of slq(2). it is cosemisimple
and there is one simple (right) comodule vl for each integer dimension,
conventionally labelled by a half-integer l such that the dimension is 2l + 1.
thus, the peter-weyl decomposition (11) is

suq(2) = ml 1

n0

2

(v 

l  vl).

there is a hopf -algebra surjection  : suq(2)  u (1) corresponding to
the diagonal inclusion in the commutative case. this denes the quantum 2-
sphere s2
q as the right homogeneous -space u (1)suq(2). under the coaction
of u (1) induced by  the comodules vl decompose into inequivalent one-
dimensional comodules. those are classied by integers i such that the
coaction takes the form v 7 v  gi. this determines up to normalisation
a basis {v(l)
n } for vl, where n are half-integers such that the coaction of
u (1) is v(l)
n 7 v(l)
n  g2n. it turns out that the indices n take the values
l, l + 1, . . . , l. in particular, we nd that v u (1)
is one-dimensional if l is
integer and zero-dimensional otherwise. thus, (12) simplies to

l

s2
q

= mln0

vl

as right suq(2)-comodules. we write the induced (normalisation indepen-
dent) basis vectors of suq(2) as t(l)
n is dual to
e(l)
n and  : vl  vl suq(2) is the coaction of suq(2) on vl. as a subalgebra
u (1) = u (1)suq(2)u (1)
q has the basis {t(l)

m n(cid:17) = m,n
(cid:16)t(l)

and  t(l)

m n =xk

m k  t(l)

k n.

the antipode and -structure of suq(2) in this basis are

s t(l)

m n = (q)mnt(l)

m n(cid:17)
n m, (cid:16)t(l)

= s t(l)

n m = (q)nmt(l)

m n.

as can be veried by direct calculation from the formulas in [22, 4.2.4]. the
i j = l,0. we

normalised invariant integral (haar functional) is simply r t(l)

17

also need its value on the product of two basis elements

z t(l)

m nt(l)

m n =

(1)mnqm+n

[2l + 1]q

l,lm+m,0n+n,0.

(13)

this can be easily worked out considering the equation (a) = r a(1) s a(2)
and using the invariance of the integral in the form b(1)r ab(2) = s a(1)r a(2)b
and s b(2)r ab(1) = a(2)r a(1)b on basis elements. the q-integers for q  c

are dened as

[n]q :=

n1xk=0

qn2k1 =

qn  qn
q  q1 .

(the second expression is only valid if q2 6= 1).

denoting a dual basis of {t(l)

m n} we observe that suq(2) be-
comes an object in msuq(2) with evaluation ev : suq(2)  suq(2)  c
and coevaluation coev : c  suq(2)  suq(2) by the coaction t(l)
m n 7

m n} by {t(l)

pk

m k  s1 t(l)
t(l)
n k.
in the commutative case q = 1 the basis {t(l)

m n} becomes the usual basis of
regular functions (i.e., matrix elements of representations) on su (2) (see e.g.
[23, chapter 6] to which conventions we conform in this case). the restriction
to {t(l)
0 n} recovers nothing but (a version of) the spherical harmonics on s2.
in particular, we notice that the zonal spherical functions can be expressed
in terms of legrende polynomials t(l)
0 0(, , ) = pl(cos ), where , ,  are
the euler angles on su (2) (see [23, chapter 6]). from the orthogonality
relation of the legendre polynomials, the fact that their only common value
is at pl(1) = 1, and considering that  = 0 denotes a pole of su (2), we nd
that the delta function at the identity of su (2) can be represented as

0(, , ) =xl

(2l + 1)pl(cos ) =xl

t(l)
0 0(, , ).

(14)

for calculations we need the functionals u and v dened for a coquasi-

triangular structure r as (see e.g. [13])

u(a) := r(a(2)  s a(1)),

v(a) := r(a(1)  s a(2)).

(15)

for suq(2) in our basis they are

u(t(l)

m n) = m,n q2l(l+1)+2m,

v(t(l)

m n) = m,n q2l(l+1)2m.

(16)

we also note that property (10) is satised, i.e.,

r(cid:16)t(l)

0 0  t(l)

i j(cid:17) = i,j = r(cid:16)t(l)

0 0(cid:17) .

see the appendix for a derivation of (16) and (17).

5.2 the free 2-point function

the rst step towards the free 2-point function is to dene the free action.
for this we need an analogue of the laplace operator. we note that by
the duality of suq(2) with the quantum enveloping algebra uq(sl2), a cental
element of the latter denes an invariant operator on suq(2)-comodules. a
natural choice is the quantum casimir element which we dene as

cq = ef +

(k  1)q1 + (k 1  1)q

(q  q1)2

.

here k, k 1, e, and f are the generators of uq(sl2) (see the appendix). cq
diers from quantum casimir elements considered elsewhere (see e.g. [21]
or [22]) only by a q-multiple of the identity. the eigenvalue of cq on vl is
[l]q[l +1]q so that we get exactly the (negative of the) usual laplace operator
for q = 1. including a mass term we set

l = cq + m2.

thus, the eigenvalue of l on vl is

ll = [l]q[l + 1]q + m2.

now we can determine  according to (5). using (13) we nd

1(cid:16)t(l)

0 i(cid:17) =xm,j

inverting we obtain

0 j z t(m)

t(m)

now we are ready to determine the free 2-point function according to corol-
lary 2.2.

to be the reduced form of the 2-point function as an element of s2

the commutative case (q = 1) we can rewrite (18) as

u (1). in

ez 2 |q=1 = (m2  )10

by comparison with (14). this is the familiar expression for the free 2-point
function (propagator).

5.3 interactions

we proceed to evaluate the order 1 contribution of the 4 interaction to the
2-point function. the corresponding diagrams are depicted in gure 4 (see
section 2.3). since the property (10) holds in suq(2) the diagrams simplify
to those of gure 9 (see section 3.2). the disconnected loop comes out as

loop :=

=xl

[2l + 1]q

[l]q[l + 1]q + m2 q2l(l+1).

(19)

(just apply the counit to (18).) the connected diagram in the right hand
summand of gure 9 is (in reduced form)

=(cid:18)id   z (cid:19)  (id2 )  (id  z2  id)  z 2

its reduced form (18), the property r  s =r of the integral, and (13). the

connected diagram in the left hand summand of gure 9 is (in reduced form)

q2l(l+1). we have used z 2 as reconstructed from

l

here we have also used the invariance of the integral in the form (r ab(2))b(1) =
(r a(2)b) s a(1) in the third equality. thus, the (reduced) 2-point function up

to order 1 comes out as

0 0

(cid:16)1  6  loop l1

l q2l(l+1)(1 + q2l(l+1)) + o(2)(cid:17) .

(20)

in the commutative case (q = 1), we know that the order 1 contribution
(given by the tadpole diagram in gure 5) is divergent. we can easily see
where this divergence comes from. the loop contribution (19)

loop|q=1 =xl

2l + 1

l(l + 1) + m2

(21)

is innite. however, at q > 1 it becomes nite! we are truly able the
regularise the tadpole diagram. let us identify the divergency in q-space.
for q > 1 we can nd both an upper and a lower bound for (19) of the form

const +z 

1

dl

2
l

q2l2

,

where const does not depend on q (but may depend on m2). setting q = e2h2
with h > 0 we nd

loop|q>1 =

1
h

+ o(1).

the conventional divergence of (21) is only logarithmical in l. what
would happen with higher divergencies? it seems natural to assume that
they would give rise to terms like

xl

[l]n

q q2l(l+1).

but this converges in the domain q > 1 for any n. we can even apply the
very same discussion of the divergence in q-space as above. the nature of
the divergence in q-space does not seem to be aected by the degree of the

21

classical divergence at all. this suggests that q-regularization in our frame-
work is powerful indeed. compare this, e.g., to dimensional regularization
which can only handle logarithmic divergencies.

reviewing our calculations of z 2 and z int

2 we nd that the crucial factor
of q2l(l+1) is caused by the braiding. thus, the braiding and not the mere
noncommutativity appears to be essential for the regularization.

5.4 renormalisation

classically, 4-theory in dimension 2 is super-renormalisable. the only basic
divergent diagram is the tadpole (gure 5). thus, if in a given diagram we
separate out all loops from tadpole vertices according to gures 7 and
8 (as we did in the last section for the tadpole), the remaining diagram
is nite at q = 1. the stripped vertices have just become 2-vertices.
notice however, that from a rigourous point of view this can only be done
if the whole diagram is nite. while we have seen that the tadpole diagram
alone becomes nite for q > 1, it is conceivable that certain diagrams that
converge at q = 1 would diverge at q > 1. this might be due to the
introduction of factors like q2l(l+1) into summations over l. the expression
(20) suggests, however, that this does not happen, but rather that all q-
factors introduced in summations have negative exponent. we shall assume
this in the following.

let us now see how renormalisation looks like in our framework. to

renormalise the coupling we set

 =  loop

at q > 1 and x  as our new coupling. then, given any diagram we
perform the stripping of tadpole loops as described above and the separated
loops cancel with 1
loop in . as q goes to 1 those loops are just 2 vertices.
however, in this limit, any other vertex vanishes due to a factor of 1
loop.
thus we remain with only 2 vertices that just correspond to an additional
mass term. the eective shift in mass is

m2  m2 + 12.

what one usually does in 4-theory is to renormalise the mass to cancel

the divergence. thus, instead of redening  we set

m2 = m2  12 loop.

to be the new mass. of course this equation must not be understood literally
in our framework since we can not write the free and the interacting part of
the action together. instead we introduce (at q > 1) a 2 vertex with a factor
of 6  loop in front. writing all diagrams of a given order, all tadpoles are
cancelled in the limit q  1 and only nite non-tadpole vertices remain.

22

6 concluding remarks

we have presented a coherent framework for the treatment of quantum eld
theory on braided spaces. although we have only discussed the scalar case,
the generalisation to elds living in non-trivial representations of the symme-
try (quantum) group should be straightforward. the example of 4-theory
on the quantum 2-sphere has shown that quantum deformations of sym-
metries do lead to the regularization of divergencies in our approach. our
results also suggest that divergencies of arbitrary order could be regularised
in this way. this appears to be a considerable advantage over dimensional
regularization. a next step would be the investigation of quantum eld the-
ories on deformations of higher dimensional spaces. we note in particular
that quantum deformations of minkowski space are available (see [24][25]
and [26][27]).

a coquasitriangular structure of suq(2)

in this section we provide the formulas for the coquasitriangular structure
of suq(2) in our peter-weyl basis needed in section 5. we use the context
of section 5.1. denitions and results that are just stated are standard and
can be found e.g. in [13] or [22].

the hopf algebra uq(sl2) is dened over c for q  c and q2 6= 1 with

generators e, f, k, k 1 and relations

kek 1 = q2e, kf k 1 = q2f,

kk 1 = k 1k = 1,

[e, f ] =

k  k 1
q  q1 ,

(e) = e  k + 1  e, (f ) = f  1 + k 1  f,

(k) = k  k,
s(k) = k 1,

(k) = 1,

(e) = (f ) = 0,

s(e) = ek 1,

s(f ) = kf.

uq(sl2) and suq(2) are non-degenerately paired. thus, actions of uq(sl2)
and coactions of suq(2) on nite dimensional vector spaces are dual to each
other. in particular, the simple comodule vl of suq(2) is a simple module
of uq(sl2). by the representation theory of uq(sl2) it has a basis {wi},

23

i = l, l + 1, . . . , l such that

k  wm = q2mwm, e  wm = ([l  m]q[l + m + 1]q)1/2wm+1

f  wm = ([l + m]q[l  m + 1]q)1/2wm1.

(22)

uq(sl2) has an h-adic version uh(sl2) dened over c[[h]] correspondingly
with q = eh and an additional generator h so that qh = k. it has the
quasitriangular structure

r = q(hh)/2

xn=0

qn(n+1)/2(1  q2)n

[n]q!

en  f n.

(23)

the elements (dene r(1)  r(2) = r)

u = (s r(2))r(1),

v = r(1) s r(2)

(24)

act on vl as [13, proposition 3.2.7]

u  wm = q2l(l+1)+2mwm,

v  wm = q2l(l+1)2mwm.

(25)

the coquasitriangular structure r of suq(2) is given by the duality with

uq(sl2) from the quasitriangular structure r of uh(sl2). using

u(a(1))a(2) = s2 a(1)u(a(2)) and v(a(1)) s2 a(2) = a(1)v(a(2))

we nd

u(cid:16)t(l)

m n(cid:17) = m,n q2(mk)u(cid:16)t(l)
k k(cid:17) ,

v(cid:16)t(l)

m n(cid:17) = m,n q2(km)v(cid:16)t(l)
k k(cid:17) .

(26)

since the denitions (15) and (24) are dual to each other we can use

g  vn =xm

vmhg, t(l)

m ni,

g  uq(sl2)

to compare (25) with (26). we nd (16) and infer that wi is (a multiple of)
vi. with the latter, the pairing between uq(sl2) and suq(2) comes out from
(22) as

hk, t(l)

m ni = m,n q2n,

he, t(l)

m ni = m,n+1([l  n]q[l + n + 1]q)1/2,

hf, t(l)

m ni = m,n1([l + n]q[l  n + 1]q)1/2.

note also hh, t(l)
(23) we easily verify the property (17).

m ni = m,n2n in the h-adic version. with this pairing and
