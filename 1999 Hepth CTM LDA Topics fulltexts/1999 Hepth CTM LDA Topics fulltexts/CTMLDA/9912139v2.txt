abstract

according to the holographic principle all information in the bulk of
a space is coded at its border. we will check this statement in three sit-
uations involving the ads/cft correspondence. there is a well known
equivalence between the maxwell-chern-simons theory and the self-
dual model in 3 dimensions when the parameters of both theories are
related in a given way. we will show that when this relation holds the
corresponding cfts at the border are the same. then we will study
scalar elds. there are two quantum theories for the scalar eld in ads
space. the usual prescription of the ads/cft correspondence which
takes dirichlet boundary conditions at the border corresponds to one of
the quantum theories. we will show that changing boundary conditions
will allow us to get the other quantum theory. finally we consider an
abelian gauge theory in ads. we will show that the corresponding cft
is independent of the gauge choice and that the gauge dependence stays
only in the contact terms at the border.

1 introduction

the holographic principle states that a quantum theory with gravity must be
describable by a boundary theory [1]. of course this raises the question on how
the detailed information in the bulk can be completely stored at the border
and this surely deserves a deep investigation. a possible way to investigate
this connection is through the ads/cft correspondence [2]. it says that the
large n limit of a certain conformal eld theory (cft) in a d-dimensional
minkowski space can be described by string/m-theory on adsd+1  k where
k is a suitable compact space. the precise relation between both theories is
given by [3]

zads[0] = z0 d exp(i[])  zcf t [0] = hexp(cid:18)z

ddxo0(cid:19)i ,

(1)

where 0 is the value taken by  at the border. on the right handed side 0 is
the external current coupling to the operator o in the boundary cft. hence
the partition function in adsd+1 allow us to obtain the correlation functions of
the boundary cft. in this sense the ads/cft correspondence is a realization
of the holographic principle.

the ads/cft correspondence in the form eq.(1) has been studied in sev-
eral situations [4]. we will analyze it the three dierent situations. in the rst
case we will concentrate in d = 3. as it is well known there is a equivalence
[5] between the maxwell-chern-simons theory [6] and the self-dual model [7]
in minkowski space. both theories are equivalent when the parameters have a
precise relation. we have been able to show that this equivalence also holds in
ads space [8]. we can then use the ads/cft correspondence to compute the
two point functions at the border. when the parameters are chosen so that
the equivalence holds we can show that the corresponding cfts at the border
are the same [8]. this shows that a relationship between two quantum eld
theories in ads is directly reected in the corresponding cfts at the border.
this is discussed in section 2.

the second case we study regards a scalar eld. there are two distinct
quantum eld theories for the scalar eld in ads. they depend on which
energy-momentum tensor is chosen [9]. using the ads/cft correspondence
in the form eq.(1), which uses dirichlet boundary conditions, one of the two
quantum theories for the scalar eld is reproduced. the other one can be
obtained by considering a dierent boundary condition [10]. therefore, as
expected, both quantum theories can be obtained using the ads/cft corre-
spondence. this will be presented in section 3.

1

finally we will consider the gauge dependence in the ads/cft context.
we take an abelian gauge theory in arbitrary gauge in an ads background.
we will show that the conformal correlators do not depend on the gauge pa-
rameter. however the holographic principle asserts that the information about
the gauge degrees of freedom must survive at the border. we indeed nd a
gauge dependence only in the contact terms which usually are thrown away
[11]. this will be the subject of section 4.

2 chern-simons theories

since we are going to consider the euclidean version of ads3 we start with the
euclidean signature action for the proca-chern-simons theory which is given
by

ff  +

ip cs = z d3xg 1
where f = a  a and  is the levicivita tensor density with
012 = 1. the eld equations which follow from eq.(2) are

and they can be manipulated to give

and r = 6 is the ads radius. we notice that the solutions of eq.(4) must
satisfy

or

+ 
(cid:18)2  m2
 

r

3(cid:19) a = 0,
3(cid:19) a = 0.

r

therefore the general solution of eq.(4) is a superposition of solutions of the
proca theory with masses m+ and m. in the at space limit we recover the

2

fact that the proca-chern-simons theory describes two massive excitations.
the proca theory in ads space has been analyzed in detail in [12].

we can now calculate the bulk to bulk propagator. the details of the
calculation can be found in [8]. then we can evaluate the classical action near
the boundary surface using the action eq.(2). after an integration by parts
and using the equations of motion we nd that there is only a contribution
from the boundary

ip cs =

1

4 z d3x (gf a) + c.c.,

which evaluated on the near boundary surface gives

ip cs = 

1

4 z d2x 2 a,i(cid:16) a,i +  f,0i(cid:17) + c.c..

(8)

(9)

here a,i is the value of the eld at the near boundary surface. when inserting
the propagator to evaluate ip cs we nd that the result is divergent in the limit
  0 so that a regularization has to be introduced. in order to have a nite
action we take the limit

m(m, ||)1 a,i(~x) = a0,i(~x).

lim
0

then we use the ads/cft correspondence in the form

exp (iads)  (cid:28)exp(cid:18)z d2x ji(~x) a0,i(~x)(cid:19)(cid:29) ,

and we nd the two point function

where p cs = (m,

to the conformal isometries in cf t2.

where m cs =|  | +1, and cm cs = ||
has conformal
dimension m cs. as it is well known the maxwell-chern-simons theory de-
scribes a particle with mass  [6] and this fact is reected in the conformal
dimension m cs. furthermore, our result is consistent with the holographic
principle since the mass m(0,|  |) = 0 is not physical in the bulk [6] and
does not contribute to the border two-point function.

in order to have a stationary action we must supplement the action eq.(14)
with a surface term which cancels its variation [13]. the variational principle
generates a boundary term

which is written in terms of the real and imaginary parts of the vector poten-
tial. since the eld equations derived from eq.(14) are rst order dierential
equations we can not choose boundary conditions which x simultaneously
the real and imaginary parts of the ais. then we choose boundary condi-
tions on the ar

the boundary term eq.(15). so we add to the action eq.(14) a surface term
of the form

(~y)e = 2csd sd ij  2

 . we then nd that the eld j sd

dj sd
where sd = m 2
has con-
formal dimension sd. therefore the conformal dimensions of the conformal
elds corresponding to the maxwell-chern-simons theory and the self-dual
model are the same for m 2
|| =|  | in agreement with the equivalence between
those models [5]. the fact that we obtain the same conformal dimension for
the corresponding cfts in the border is in support of the holographic princi-
ple. not only the conformal dimensions are the same but the coecients c of
the two-point functions can be made the same by an appropriate normalization
of the self-dual action. since we started with two independent parameters in
eq.(14) we can now choose m = || so that the model describes a particle
with mass m. now our results have an universal form in which the conformal
dimension and the two-point function coecient can be written as  = m + 1
and c = m/ respectively, where m is the mass of the bulk theory.

3 scalar field theory

scalar elds in ads spaces have been intensively studied. if the scalar eld
has mass-squared in the range d2/4 < m2 < d2/4 + 1 then there are two
possible quantum eld theories in the bulk depending on the choice of the
energy-momentum tensor [14]. the ads/cft correspondence with dirichlet
boundary condition can easily account for one of the theories. the other
one appears in a very subtle way by identifying a conjugate eld through a
legendre transform as the source of the boundary conformal operator [15].
the existence of two conjugated boundary operators has been rst pointed
out in [16].

since a eld theory is determined not only by its lagrangian but also by
its boundary terms we expect that the ads/cft correspondence must be
sensitive to these boundary terms. we will consider dirichlet and neumann

5

boundary conditions, and a combination of both of them which we will call
mixed boundary condition. each type of boundary condition requires a dif-
ferent boundary term. we will show that the mixed boundary conditions are
parametrized by a real number so that there is a one-parameter family of
boundary terms consistent with the variational principle. we will also show
that dierent types of boundary condition give rise to dierent conformal eld
theories at the border.

the two solutions found in [14] correspond to two dierent choices of
energy-momentum tensor. for the dirichlet boundary condition it is well

d/2d2/4+m2

known that the scalar eld behaves as x
near the border at x0 = 0.
0
there is no upper restriction on the mass in this case. it corresponds to one of
the solutions found in [14] and gives rise to a boundary conformal operator with

d/2+d2/4+m2

0

conformal dimension d/2 + qd2/4 + m2. we will show that for a particular
choice of mixed boundary condition and when the mass squared is in the range
d2/4 < m2 < d2/4 + 1 the scalar eld behaves as x
near the
border. it corresponds precisely to the second solution of [14] and gives rise to
a boundary conformal operator with conformal dimension d/2 qd2/4 + m2.
note that the upper limit for the mass squared d2/4+1 is consistent with the
unitarity bound (d  2)/2. another important point that we will show is the
existence of boundary conditions which give rise to boundary conformal oper-
ators for which the unitarity bound (d 2)/2 is reached. they correspond to a
massless scalar eld with neumann boundary condition or to a massive scalar
eld with m2 > d2/4 + 1 with a particular choice of the mixed boundary
condition (the same choice which gives the boundary operator with conformal
dimension d/2  qd2/4 + m2). in this way, using dierent boundary condi-

tions, we obtain all scalar conformal eld theories allowed by the unitarity
bound.

the action for the massive scalar eld theory is given by

i0 =

1

2 z dd+1xg(cid:16)g + m22(cid:17) ,

and the corresponding equation of motion is

(23)

(24)

in order to have a stationary action we must supplement the action i0 with a
boundary term is which cancels its variation. the appropriate action is then
i = i0 + is.

(cid:16)2  m2(cid:17)  = 0.

6

id =

1

2 z dd+1x  (g  ) = 

1

2 z ddx d+1  0 .

(26)

in order to capture the eect of the minkowski boundary of the adsd+1,
situated at x0 = 0, we rst consider a boundary value problem on the boundary
surface x0 =  > 0 and then take the limit   0 at the very end. then the
variational principle applied to the action i gives

i = z ddx d+1 0  + is = 0,

(25)

where  and 0 are the value of the eld and its derivate at x0 =  respec-
tively. this equation will be used below to nd out the appropriate boundary
term is for each type of boundary condition.

for dirichlet boundary condition the variation of the eld at the border
vanishes so that the rst term in eq.(25) also vanishes and the usual action i0
is already stationary. making use of the eld equation the action i takes the
form

it is to be understood that 0 in eq.(26) is evaluated in terms of the dirichlet
data .

to consider neumann boundary conditions we rst take a unitary vector
which is inward normal to the boundary n(x0) = (x0, 0). the neumann
boundary condition then xes the value of n()  n. the boundary
term to be added to the action reads

is = z dd+1x  (g g  ) = z ddx d+1  0 ,

so that we nd the following expression for the action at the boundary

in =

1

2 z ddx d  n .

(27)

(28)

here  is to be expressed in terms of the neumann value n. notice that the
on-shell value of the action with neumann boundary condition eq.(28) diers
by a sign from the corresponding action with dirichlet boundary condition
eq.(26).

we now consider a boundary condition which xes the value of a linear

combination of the eld and its normal derivative at the border

(x) + n(x)  (x) .

(29)

we will call it mixed boundary condition. here  is an arbitrary real but
non-zero coecient. in this case the surface term to be added to the action is

i 
s =



2 z dd+1x  (g g n) = 



2 z ddx d+2 0 0 ,

(30)

7

and we nd the following expression for the action at the boundary

i 
m = 

1

2 z ddx d+1 

 0 .

(31)

clearly 0 in the above expression must be written in terms of the boundary
data 
 . we then have a one-parameter family of surface terms since the
variational principle does not impose any condition on .
in this way the
value of the on-shell action eq.(31) also depends on .

we can now calculate the bulk to bulk propagator for each boundary con-
dition. the details are given in [10]. we then nd the following two-point
functions. for dirichlet boundary conditions:

we then nd that dierent boundary conditions in the ads/cft corre-
spondence allow us to derive boundary two-point functions which are consis-
tent with the unitarity bound. in the neumann case the unitarity bound is
obtained for m = 0 while with mixed boundary conditions it is reached when
 = 0 and m2 > d2/4+1. the corresponding two-point functions have dier-
ent normalizations. the conformal dimension d/2 is obtained in the case of
mixed boundary condition with  = 0 and d2/4 < m2 < d2/4 + 1, and the
normalization of the corresponding boundary two-point function diers from
the one found in [15].

another important point is the interpretation of the new boundary condi-
tions in the string theory context. dirichlet boundary conditions are natural
when thinking of the asymptotic behavior of the supergravity elds reaching
the border of the ads space. possibly neumann and mixed boundary condi-
tions are related to more complex solutions involving strings and membranes
reaching the border in more subtle ways.

4 abelian gauge theory

for the abelian gauge eld in a xed gauge the corresponding conformal cor-
relators were found in [3]. now we will consider the gauge dependence of this
result. to do that we take the formulation of electrodynamics in an arbi-
trary gauge when the space-time background is adsd+1. as in the case of at
minkowski space it will prove convenient to start from the stuckelberg action

(44)
where f = a  a,  is the covariant derivative and a is a real
positive constant. electrodynamics in an arbitrary covariant gauge, specied
by the constant a, is dened as the limit m2  0 of stuckelberg theory. on
the other hand the limit a  , while keeping m2 > 0, results in the proca
theory. the mass term in (44) will help us to control the infrared divergent
terms which will arise along the calculation.

9

the lagrange equations of motion arising from (44) are

f  +

1
a l  m2a = 0 ,

(45)

where l  gga. we now use a decomposition of a into a scalar
eld   a, and a vector eld u   a  1
am2 . these new elds
satisfy, respectively, the equations of motion

and

(cid:16) g  am2(cid:17)  = 0,
u   m2u  = 0 .

(46)

(47)

clearly u  is a proca eld with mass m since u  = 0.
as usual we shall look for a solution written in terms of boundary eld
values specied at the near-boundary surface x0 =  the limit   0 being
performed at the very end of the calculations. the details are given in [11].
first of all we must make sure that the massless limit can be taken. there are
infrared divergences in /am2 and u but a careful analysis shows that they
cancel out when the eld a is recomposed. this shows that a is indeed an
analytic function of m2 in the vicinity of m2 = 0.

in the computation of the two-point function we nd that all potentially
dangerous powers of  cancel out among themselves. we then nd that the
gauge dependence concentrates on the contact terms while the non-trivial part
of the boundary conformal theory correlators turns out to be that already
found by working in a completely xed gauge[3]. another important feature
is that although we have xed all components of the potential at the border
the pieces containing a,0 give only contact terms and the only non-trivial
pieces are those containing a,i. therefore the boundary theory still retains
information on the gauge degrees of freedom of the bulk theory. this then
lends further support to the holographic principle.
