abstract

we propose that the spectrum of light mesons (the  and , together

with their radial excitations) can be calculated in the limit of vanishing light

quark masses by studying gauge theory (open string theory) on suitable higher

dimensional background geometries. using the metric proposed by witten for

glueball calculations as a paradigmatic example, we nd a spectrum which is

in startlingly good agreement with the masses tabulated by the particle data

group [1]. these calculations have only one free parameter, corresponding to

the overall mass scale. we make predictions for the next several particles in

the spectrum.

string theory arose as an attempt to understand the strong interactions. with the ad-

vent of gauge theories in the early 1970s, string theory metamorphosed into a theory of

everything, and, until recently, has had little new to say about strong interaction phe-

nomenology.

the last two years, however, have seen dramatic progress towards understanding the

relationship between string theory and gauge theories. maldacenas conjecture of the rela-

tionship between n = 4 supersymmetric gauge theories in four dimensions and string theory
(supergravity) on ads 5  s 5 has proven very fruitful [25]. wittens conjectured extension
to non-supersymmetric theories [6] has provided the basis for calculations of glueball mass

spectra which have been directly compared to the results of lattice calculations with good

numerical agreement [79].

unfortunately, the calculations presented to date correspond to theories which do not

contain states with light quarks, and so are not directly relevant to the real world. indeed,

the question as to how to create such models starting with string theory or m-theory is still

unclear.

there is, however, a qualitative line of reasoning to pursue. qcd ux tubes are presum-

ably the starting point for a stringy picture of the strong interactions. the extra dimensions

involved in the maldacena/witten conjectures plausibly correspond in some fashion to in-

ternal degrees of freedom (such as thickness) of the ux tube. it is thus reasonable that

masses of glueballs, which are closed ux tubes in a qcd picture, can be calculated in terms

of closed (super)string modes on non-trivial higher dimensional backgrounds, such as those

proposed by witten and others.

mesons, on the other hand, should be associated with the modes of open strings. this

correspondance was made in the early days of string theory, and is also suggested by a

constituent quark picture in which the quark and antiquark of a meson are connected by a

qcd ux tube. since the ends of open strings move at the speed of light, this picture suggests

that we will be modeling states with massless quarks; i.e. chiral symmetry is spontaneously,

but not explicitly, broken. if the dynamics of these meson ux tubes are locally the same as

2

those for glueballs, then meson dynamics in the real world should correspond to open string

dynamics on the same spaces considered in the glueball calculations.

the purpose of this paper is to explore the implications of this suggestion. we do this

by studying the mass spectrum associated with the lowest mode of the open (super)string:

a massless gauge eld a. our calculations closely follow the calculations of the glueball

mass, so our description will be brief.

though the interacting theory will be expressed in terms of a non-abelian eld strength,

we only need the quadratic part of the lagrangian to calculate masses and so we take

f = a  a. we similarly suppress the isospin indices of the  and  elds, and the
corresponding indices on the gauge eld a.

we choose a gauge in which ar = 0, and make an ansatz for the modes of interest:

a = h(r)eikx,

ai = i(k)g(r)eikx,

(3)

(4)

where i denes the polarization of the vector mesons. the equations of motion then imply

that   k = 0 and that

(r6  1)r[r7rh(r)]  k2r9h(r) = 0,
r[(r7  r)rg(r)]  k2r3g(r) = 0.

the physical  and , together with their radial excitations, thus correspond respectively

to solutions of the equations (5) and (6) which are regular at r = 1 (the horizon of the black

hole), and which are normalizable, i.e.

fall o suciently rapidly as r  . the masses

are given by the corresponding eigenvalues, m2

i = k2
i .

an interesting feature of eqn. (5), in contrast to eqn. (6) and the corresponding glueball

equations, is that it has an acceptable solution for k2 = 0 given by h(r) = a/r6. there is

thus a massless pion, as expected from the above general considerations.

other particle masses are found by numerical techniques. we have calculated the series

solution about r = 1 (a regular singular point of our equations), and used this to determine

the functions and their derivatives at r = 1.01. these values are then used as input to

numerically integrate the equations. since normalizable solutions vanish for large r, while

non-normalizable ones do not, an eigenvalue is signaled by a change in sign of the solution at

large r as k2 is changed. successive eigenvalues should correspond to successive excitations

of the  (resp. ). we have tested this technique by calculating the glueball spectrum, and

reproduce the precise results of [9] to the accuracy quoted here.

the overall mass scale is not determined by our equations. we x this by comparison

with the data, minimizing pi((mobs

i

)2  (mcalc

i

)2)2 with respect to . the result,  = .043,

is not very dierent if, for example, one minimizes the dierences between masses rather

than squared-masses.

in table i we tabulate our results together with the observed masses of the corresponding

particles. the resulting agreement is surprisingly good. the worst agreement is for the

(135) and (770), and is presumably a consequence of the fact that there is no explicit

chiral symmetry breaking in this model. the general pattern is consistent with quark-model

expectations: the mass of the  will be high if the mass of the  is low, and these eects

will be less important at higher masses. (this, incidentally, is why normalizing to the mass

of the  is probably not the best way of comparing the calculations to the data.)

it is worth while making a few comments about the states that we have included. the

eigenvalues of the equations (5) and (6) correspond, respectively, to masses of successive

radial excitations of the  and . the (1700), which has the same overall quantum numbers

as the , is a d-wave state [1], and thus an orbital excitation of the  which should not be

reproduced by the present calculation. the (2150), which we have included, is presented in

the full meson particle listings but is omitted in the data summary table of the review of

4

particle physics. since we did not include this mode in determining the scale, it is in some

sense a prediction of the present calculations.

there are no other states in the meson particle listings with quantum numbers such

that they should be reproduced by this calculation. we do, however, predict additional

radial excitations of the  at 2.32 gev and 2.88 gev and of the  at 2.64 gev. though

it may be dicult to isolate such states, it would be extremely interesting to conrm (or

deny) their existence. an innite number of additional states are also predicted, but all

have masses larger than 3 gev.

we believe that these results strongly suggest that present string theory technology is

directly relevant to strong interaction phenomenology. a number of directions for further

work immediately suggest themselves.

first, we have not discussed the kaluza-klein modes associated with the s 4 directions.

in the glueball case, modications of the metric (2) corresponding to rotating d-branes

decouple the unwanted kaluza-klein modes without signicantly changing the masses of

the physical glueballs [10]. we expect similar results here, but this must be checked.

second, the fact that the pion is massless in this model is extremely interesting.

in

addition to studying the implications of this, one should also study the impact of adding an

explicit mass term to the action (1). generalizations of this may permit the extension of

this model to k and k  mesons, and perhaps others.

beyond this, it may be possible to study interactions in this model. since baryons can

already be understood as topological excitations of pions in skyrme models [11], perhaps a

similar understanding is possible here. finally, other modes of the open string should be

studied; they should correspond to other mesons, including orbital excitations of the  and

.

we hope to report on some of these issues in the near future.
