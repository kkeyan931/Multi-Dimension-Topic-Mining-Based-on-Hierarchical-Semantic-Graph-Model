abstract

an analogy is noted between rg ow equations in 4dimensional gauge theory, as de-

rived from the ads/cft correspondence, and the rg ow equations in 4dimensional

eld theory coupled to a particular limit of weyl supergravity. this suggests a possible

theory of dynamical 3-branes with uctuating 4dimensional conformal factor. the

argument involves a map from ows in 4-dimensional gauge theories to ows in a class

of 2-dimensional sigma models.

1. introduction

according to recent conjectures, n = 4 supersymmetric su(n) yang mills theory with t
hooft coupling

 = g2

y m n ,

as well as various other conformally invariant 4d gauge theories have strong coupling de-

scriptions in terms of type iib superstring theory on ads5 times various einstein manifolds
n 2 , while -corrections are
. in particular, the strong-coupling limit    can be investigated in

[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. string loop corrections are proportional to 1
proportional to 1
the supergravity approximation.

this dual description has been used to study rg ows in 4d gauge theory in the large-n,

large- limit, based on the interpretation of the radial coordinate of ads5 as the scale of the

4d theory [8, 9, 10, 29]. the type iib supergravity equations of motion then become rg

ow equations.

here it is rst demonstrated how - at least in the vicinity of xed points - these 4d

ows can be related to ows in 2d sigma models with 5d target space and ramond-ramond

backgrounds. fixed points are mapped to xed points, and c-functions, beta functions and

phase diagrams of the 4d and 2d theories are related to each other. this puts the previous

supergravity results into a form in which they might be extendable to all orders in .

it is then noted that the 4d ows look very much like ows in 4d eld theories coupled

to conformally self-dual 4d gravity [11, 12, 13], where the dynamics of the conformal

factor originates from the 4d conformal anomaly. it is speculated that this suggests that

the world-brane theory of n d-branes is really a theory that contains this version of 4d

supergravity; and that this suggests a theory of dynamical 3-branes that might be analogous

to the polyakov formulation of dynamical strings.

2. general setup

we consider type iib string theory in an ads5 e5 background. e5 is an einstein manifold,
so its ricci tensor is rmn = gmn with some  and m, n  {5, 6, 7, 8, 9}. let us parametrize

1

the einstein manifold by coordinates m and denote by x|| the coordinates x,   {0, 1, 2, 3},
of the 4d space parallel to the boundary of ads5. the radial coordinate of ads5 will be
called . the ads5  e5 metric is then

ds2 = d2 + e2()dx2
||

+ l2gmndmdn,

(2.1)

where g is dened such that the volume of e5 as measured in the metric g is one; by a proper

choice of coordinates, g can also locally be made to have unit determinant:

vol e5 = 1 ,

det g = 1 .

l is a parameter that is related to  by

 =


l2

, where

rmn = gmn .

with these denitions, we nd that e5 and ads5 have the same curvature scalar up to a

sign if 5 = 16 2 (dot means d/d), i.e.

() = 

q
4


l

with

q 

5 .

(2.2)

the sign is such that the boundary of ads5 is at   . g, l  e and the dilaton  are
independent of :

g = g0 = const.

 = 0 = const.

 = 0 = const.

(2.3)

(2.4)

(2.5)

all other elds are zero, except that there are also n units of electric and magnetic ramond-

ramond 5-form ux:

such that

ie 5

f (5) = ie 5 f (5)  n ,

 g00g11g22g33g44f01234f01234 = g55g66g77g88g99f56789f56789 

n 2
l10 .

2

now,the target space elds of type iib superstring theory appear as coupling constants

both in the 4d yang-mills theory and in the 2d sigma model that lives on the string world-

sheet. in the 4d lagrangean the string elds appear as follows:

ly m  e tr f 2
+  tr f  f
+ gab tr ab

+ a(4)

abcd tr a  b  c  d + ...

(2.6)

(2.7)

(2.8)

(2.9)

here,  and a(4) are the ramond-ramond 0-form and 4-form, and a are the scalar elds
of the sym theory, where a, b  {1, ..., 6}. we have omitted the two-form gauge elds, but
they can be included. so we have the well-known relations

e = g2

y m

 =   angle ,

(2.10)

(2.11)

etc. furthermore, g is directly related to g. e.g., in the case e5 = s5, g =  and, using

spherical coordinates (r, m) in aspace, we have

gab dadb  dr2 + r2gmn()dmdn .

(), on the other hand, is not a coupling constant of the yang-mills theory. it will be

regarded as an auxiliary parameter below and eliminated by its equations of motion. l is

also not an independent yang-mills coupling constant, and will be regarded as an auxiliary

parameter, too  its equation of motion relates it, at xed points, to the t hooft coupling:

l4  g2

y m n .

the same type iib string elds also appear as coupling constants in the 2d lagrangean

of the world-sheet sigma model, but of course dierently:

l  r(2)
+ ()2

+ l2gmnmn

3

(2.12)

(2.13)

(2.14)

+ e2xx

+ rr-backgrounds

(2.15)

(2.16)

now, this sigma model contains more coupling constants than the yang-mills theory:

it

contains the auxiliary parameters () and l, and it also allows in principle for a non

at 4d metric g. it is therefore natural to instead consider a reduced sigma model that

accounts only for the ym coupling constants - namely the sigmamodel with only 5d internal

target space, parametrized by m, rather than the full 10d target space, and without the l2

factor in the embedding space metric:

l  r(2) + gmnmn + rr-backgrounds on e5.

then xed points of the 4d gauge theory (with only , but not the dilaton and the metric

of the einstein manifold changing as a function of ) correspond to xed points of this 2d

sigma model. we want to suggest how furthermore, at least in supergravity approximation,

4d c-functions are mapped to 2d c-functions, based on [9], and how the whole ow in the 4d

gauge theory is mapped onto a ow in the 2d sigma model for the internal compact space.

this relation between the rg ow in this sigma model with 5d target space and the ow

in 4d yangmills theory will be based on the interpretation of  in terms of the scale of

the yangmills theory [14, 15]: for the ads metric in (2.1,2.2), we can absorb overall scale

transformations on the brane

in shifts

x||  x|| e

   +

q

l .

in this sense,  is rg time (the uv end  =  is at the ads boundary at  = ),
and the -dependence of the string elds g, , , a(4), ... describes how the coupling constants

run under scale transformations. rg trajectories in the gauge theory are thus viewed as
time-dependent classical solutions {g(), (), (), a(4)(), ...} of string theory [8, 9]. this
is quite analogous to the situation in the case of the rg ow in 2d eld theory coupled to

gravity, where rg trajectories are also classical solutions of string theory [16].

4

if g, , , a(4), ... (and, as a consequence, l and ()) are constant, we have a scale

invariant theory or rg xed point  both in the 4d and the 2d eld theories. we will study

the ow in the vicinity of such xed points:

gmn = g0

mn + gmn(, )

 = 0 + (, )

 = (, ),

(2.17)

(2.18)

(2.19)

and so on. this is the most general ansatz consistent with poincare invariance on the brane

(we also make the local gauge choice g = gm = 0). we collectively denote (the modes of)

the string eld variations  i.e. the coupling constants of both the 4d and 2d eld theory 
by ~:

and assume that all the coupling constants ~ are small.

~()  {gmn, , , ...} .

as the other target space elds vary, l = e2 and  will also adjust:

 = 0 +  ,  = 

q

l

+  .

then the scale e () is (by holography)

(e )() = e().

the auxiliary parameters ,  will be eliminated below by solving their equations of motion

in the vicinity of xed points.

3. 4d ows from 2d ows

the relation we propose between the 4d and 2d ows is derived in appendix a in the classical

supergravity approximation following the method used in [17] with the following result. write

the perturbed gauge theory lagrangean as

l4 = l0

4 + ~  ~o4 ,

5

4 corresponds to the 4d cft, whose central charge we call c4.1 write the perturbed
where l0
action of the 2d sigma model with 5d target space parametrized by m, and target space

metric g (and not g!), as:

l2 = l0

2 + ~  ~o2 ,

2 corresponds to the 2d cft with central charge c2. call the beta functions in the

where l0
2d sigma model ~(5), so the 2d ow obeys

i = (5)

i = j

i j + cjk

i jk + ... ,

(3.1)

i are the dimensions of the 2d eld theory, cjk

where j
i are the ope coecients, and more
generally, the beta functions are gradients of the 2d c-function c2(~). then the ow of the

same coupling constants in the 4d gauge theory obeys in the vicinity of xed points, i.e. to
linear order2 in , : (but possibly to all orders in )

q2
16

~ + 4
(

~) = ~(5)

with q2 =

5  c2

3

+ h.o.

(3.2)

(3.3)

the statement is that on the rhs of (3.2) we have the same beta functions (3.1) as in the

2d sigma model, only the lhs changes in going from the 2d sigma model to the 4d gauge

theory. this implies that xed points are mapped to xed points, and the structure of xed

points and ows between them in 4d gauge theory seems to be at least as rich as in 2d eld

theory. moreover, there might be a natural way in which the cfunction of 2d eld theory

induces a cfunction of 4d gauge theory, as discussed in point 4 below.

in the following we will occasionally redene    = 4

q  . then the equation becomes
5  c2

.

(3.4)

~ + q

~ = ~(5) ,

with

q2 =

3

to compare with some of the literature [8], [9], note that the same equations also apply to
gauged supergravity. in this case the coupling constants ~ correspond to the 42 scalar elds
j that represent deformations of the metric, b-elds,  and , and the c-function c2(~) 5

1i.e. the conformal anomaly coecients are c4 = c = a.
2there are nonuniversal corrections of order 2 to the lhs; also, at next order, the rhs of eqn. (3.3)

contains a term proportional to 2 (see (5.20)).

6

is represented by the the potential v() = 1

l2 v (). in the case of supersymmetric ows,
describing bps-saturated kink solitons of gauged supergravity [9], the second-order ow

equations become standard rst-order ow equations (the bogomolnyi equations). even

without supersymmetry, it is possible to dene modied beta functions

(4)i

= (4)i

jj + c(4)i

jkjk ,

such that the 4d ow becomes rstorder:

i = (4)i

. plugging the rstorder equations into

the second order equations (3.2) yields the modied beta function coecients order by order

(see below and [18]).

the above statements are well-known in the supergravity approximation. one reason

for rewriting them in the form of a relation between 4d gauge theory and 2d eld theory

(rather than supergravity) is to motivate the comments in the next section. another reason

is that now it makes sense to ask whether relation (3.2,3.3) might holdi, in the vicinity of

xed points, beyond the supergravity approximation. before commenting on this, however,

let us summarize what the relation is good for:

1. dimensions: keeping only the linear part of the 2d beta functions i = (2)

i i, the

dimensions (4)

i

of the 4d operators obey

(4)((4) + 4) =

16
q2 (2)

i

.

we have to drop one of the two dressings. in supergravity approximation, where

q2 =

1
3

(c2  5) = r = 5 ,

this relation takes on a form that is well-known [3, 4].

2. ope coecients: the quadratic beta function coecients c(2)

ijk are universal if (2)

i

is

small (of order ). to relate the ope coecients in two and four dimensions, we
i = 0 and make the ansatz that the 4d ow  in (3.2) also obeys a
assume that (2)

rst-order dierential equation, similarly as in [18]:

 = c(4)

ijkjk + ...

7

plugging this into (3.2) and expandig yields:

c(4)
ijk =

4
q2 c(2)
ijk .

3. phase diagrams: since xed points are mapped to xed points and relevant, marginal

and irrelevant directions of the ow near xed points are again mapped onto relevant,

marginal and irrelevant directions, the phase diagrams of the 4d and 2d theories should

also agree.

4. c-functions: the 2d c-function c2(~) always decreases along the 2d ow, as the beta

functions are its gradients. but (3.2) describes the damped motion of a particle in the
potential c2(~), so at least near the xed point c2(~) also decreases along the 4d ow.

in this sense, the c-function of 2d eld theory might also give rise to a c-function of 4d

gauge theory. away from the xed point it seems hard to make a clear statement.

more generally, a good 4d c-function c4(~) might be some function of the 2d c-function
c2(~). to see precisely what function, note that it has been argued in [9] within the
supergravity approximation that ( )3 (  is dened in section 2) is proportional to to

the 4d conformal anomaly at xed points and might be taken as a 4d c-function. since
2  (c  5) at xed points (see appendix a), it is tempting to conjecture a possible
generalization of this statement to higher orders in : that the 4d cfunction follows

from the 2d c-function by

[c4(~)  k]  [c2(~)  5] 3
2 ,

where we have allowed for some constant k. the relative minus sign is needed to make

c4 decrease, rather than increase along the ow.

could the relations (3.2,3.3) be, in the vicinity of xed points, exact in ? one possibility

to adress this question would be to include -corrections to the string eective action and
check whether they are of higher order in |~|, i.e. vanish in the vicinity of xed points.
another possibility is suggested by noting that the relation between 2d sigma model ows

and 4d ym-ows is reminiscent of the relation between 2d sigma model ows and ows in

8

2d sigma models coupled to 2d gravity: suppose we perturb a 2d cft:

then the coupling constants will typically ow under scale transformations:

l = l + ioi

~ = ~ .

how is this ow modied if the 2d eld theory is coupled to (super-)gravity? the answer is

(see the appendix of [19] for a review):

2
4

~ + q
(

~) = ~ with q2 =

dcrit  c

3

and some constant . now in 2d gravity we can prove that these equations are exact in 
in the vicinity of the xed point (i.e. to order |~|), and hold not just in the supergravity
approximation. this works as follows [20]: the cft coupled to gravity is described by a

cft with one more eld , the liouville mode. at the xed point, the two cfts decouple:

scf t + z d2 (2 + q r) .

using opes, we know the exact central charge c and dimension of the operator e in the

second cft:

c = 1 + 3q2

,

dim(e)  ( + q).

conformal invariance of the perturbed theory then implies the two ow equations above [16],

dening  = 

2 . in the case of 4d sym, it is of course much harder to check whether the ow
equations are exact in  because of the ramond-ramond backgrounds. it might be possible,
though, to turn the ramondramond backgrounds in the xsector (which is the analog
of the above sector) into neveu-schwarz backgrounds by duality transformations. we must

leave this subject to future work.

9

4. dynamical 4d conformal factor ?

let us now come to a key point of this paper. secondorder ow equations like (3.2) seem

to be typical for rg ows in theories with a uctuating scale, as in the case of 2d gravity

just mentioned. in fact, the equation (3.4),

~ + q

~  ~ ,

q2  conformal anomaly

(4.1)

looks precisely like the ow equation in 4d eld theory coupled to a particularly interest-

ing limit of weyl supergravity: conformally selfdual gravity. by conformally selfdual

gravity we mean 4d gravity with action

z d4xg(w 2 + ...)

in the limit

   ,

(4.2)

where w 2 is the weyl2 term.

before going any further, one point must be adressed. there is a well-known problem

common to all fourth-order derivative actions, like the weyl2 action: we can rewrite them

in terms of new elds with two derivatives only, but some of them will have the wrong sign

in the kinetic term. with minkowskian signature, this leads to perturbative non-unitarity.

for this reason, we can only consider euclidean signature in this section.

let us now rst give an argument why conformally selfdual gravity might indeed arise

as part of the worldvolume theory.3 then let us explain why this theory leads to ow

equations of the type (4.1).

kaluza-klein reduction

why might (4.2) arise as part of the worldbrane theory? let us start with the dual for-

mulation of the d3worldbrane theory in terms of 5-dimensional gauged supergravity in an

ads5 background. suppose we further kaluza-klein reduce this 5d gravity theory along
z = exp{ q
l} onto the 4d boundary of ads5 (similarly as in [22]). by this we mean that all
elds except for the warp factor in the line element 1
are assumed to be independent



4

z2 dx2
||

of the 5th coordinate z, and z is integrated over. (in standard kaluza-klein reduction there

3for another (dierent) discussion of the role of weyl gravity in the context of the ads/cft correspon-

dence, see [21].

10

would be no warp factor and z would be some circular coordinate.) now, as in standard

kaluza-klein reduction, the 5d hilbert-einstein action induces a 4d hilbert-einstein action.

its coecient (the inverse 4d newton constant) diverges (we neglect factors of l):

2 ,

where we have cut o ads5 at some small distance z =  from the boundary. this divergence

is powerlike and not universal, in the sense that it depends on precisely how we cut of ads5

at its boundary. there is however a universal log  divergence of the form [23]

z d4xg( w 2 + ...) ,

with  = c log    ,

where the number c is proportional to the 4d conformal anomaly. so if we assume that

we can pick a renormalization scheme (i.e. a way to regularize the divergences at the

boundary) in which the non-universal hilbert-einstein (and cosmological) term vanishes,

then what remains is indeed the conformally self-dual gravity action.

precisely the bosonic sector of this supergravity theory in the limit    has previously
been studied by fradkin and tseytlin [11] and as a theory closely analogous to 2d gravity

by antoniadis and mottola [12] and by the author [13]. it is a renormalizable theory whose

nice properties are summarized in appendix b; the main points will be recalled below.

is this version of 4d gravity dynamical here, or does it correspond to a xed background?

there is a standard argument that says that there is no dynamical 4d gravity on the ads

boundary (see e.g.

[7]).

it asserts that the norm of those states of the 5d theory that

would correspond to 4d gravitons diverges, so these states are not normalizable. however,

this argument may not apply here, because this divergence of the norm is  like the inverse

newton constant  not universal. the divergence may also vanish in a scheme in which the

the inverse newton constant vanishes, leaving us with a nite norm state.

let us therefore try out the hypothesis that dynamical conformally selfdual 4d gravity

is indeed present on the 3brane, and show that this could reproduce at least qualitatively

the form of the ow equation (4.1).

11

conformally self-dual gravity

the following is briey reviewed in appendix b: up to topological invariants the 4d gravity

action to be studied is actually

z d4x g w 2
+ ,

   .

w+ is the self-dual part of the weyl tensor. the limit    restricts the metric to be
conformally self-dual: w+ = 0. the path integral over metrics then reduces, in analogy

with 2d gravity, to a path integral over the conformal factor  and an integral over the

moduli space of conformally self-dual metrics.

in 2d gravity, the dynamics for the conformal factor arises from the conformal anomaly

which induces the kinetic term plus background charge (neglecting the liouville potential)

  qr with q2 =

c  25

3

.

(4.3)

q is determined to make the total conformal anomaly vanish. in our 4d theory, everything

is almost completely analogous [24, 12] (see appendix b); the relevant part of the induced

lagrangean for  is

2 

1
2

qg with q2 =

b + 1538

90

with gauss-bonnet density g and b = 360b where the 4d conformal anomaly coecients
are called a, b: essentially,

< t 

 > =

1
162 (aw 2 + bg)

(assuming g is an einstein metric). some coecients a (which plays a minor role here) and

b are given in the appendix.

due to the 2 kinetic term for , its propagator is logarithmic and therefore the expo-

nential e2 has denite scaling dimension [12, 13]

dim(e) = ( + q).

as in 2d, scaling operators i of the matter theory with dimension i are gravitationally
dressed: i  eii. scale ivariance determines the dressed scaling dimension i:

i  i(i + q) = 4

12

now, perturbing the cft by operators ieii, dening i() = iei, multiplying the
above equation by i(), replacing i   and identifying i = (i  4)i + o(2) yields
the following ow equations:

~ + q

~  ~ , q2  conformal anomaly .

(4.4)

these are rg ow equations in view of the interpretation of  as the 4d conformal factor 

so overall 4d scale transformations correspond to constant shifts of .

these ow equations indeed have the same form as (4.1).

it is tempting to interpret

this as additional evidence that dynamical 3branes are described in terms of conformally

selfdual gravity coupled to matter  analogous perhaps to the description of dynamical

onebranes (strings) in terms of 2d gravity coupled to matter.

it remains to compare the coecients q in (4.1) and q in (4.4), as well as the beta

functions. this is left for future work. it is presently not even clear to the author whether

one should expect quantitative agreement, since the calculation leading to (4.1) is done

completely within classical string theory. a fascinating possibility would be that studying

the ow on dynamical 3-branes might yield nonperturbative information about string theory,

instead of reproducing the classical result.

appendix a: supergravity approximation

this appendix is based on ref.

[17], generalizing the procedure used there to the case at

hand, which includes a ramond-ramond background. we start with the superstring eective

action [25], setting  = 2 and keeping only the metric, the dilaton and the rr-5-form for

simplicity:

where d is the dimension of embedding space and the function

c (d)(~x) = d  3[r  4()2 + 4]

(5.2)

becomes ~xindependent and equal to the central charge when the sigma model represents a

conformal theory [26]. c is dened in terms of the variation of s with respect to the constant

mode of the dilaton, and therefore does not explicitly involve the rr background f (5). for

the metric we make the ansatz of section 2:

ds2 = d2 + e2()dx2

with

the rr 5-form eld strength is

the string equations of motion are the reqirements that the beta functions of the 2d sigma

model with 10d target space are zero. the beta functions for the metric and the dilaton are,
respectively (with a, b  {0, ..., 9}):

straining initial values. the last equation follows from the other ones. the ij equation has
been split into its trace and its trace-free part. g,  correspond to coupling constants ~, as

dened in section 2, while the other equations (which are not independent) x  and .

e.g.,  and  are easily xed at xed points, where

denoting

 = g =  =  = 0.

 = e , q =  ,

so that  = q

r =

dening  as in section 2 by

we have

in order to expand in the vicinity of xed points, it is useful to rst average [17], i.e. to
split the shifted dilaton (~, ) into an ~dependent part (~, ) and an ~independent part

0() as follows:

0()   log[z dn x e(~,)] ,

(~, )  (~, )  0() .

(5.13)

let us dene the space average of a function f (~) by

then dene

< f (~) > r d5 f (~) e(~)
r d5 e(~)

.

q()  0() =  < (~, ) > .

integrating (5.6) weighted by e yields

q + q2 =

(5  c),

where (5.14) has been used and we have dened the function

c() = c(g, b, ) =< c (5)(~, ) > .

(5.14)

(5.15)

(5.16)

(5.17)

c can be considered as a generalisation of the cfunction [27] of 2d eld theory.

the expansion near xed points follows as in [17]. we collectively denote g, , ... by
~ as in section 2, noting i.p. that g = l2g. next we expand the above string equations of
motion order by order in ~. it is easy to see that to lowest order it suces to set l and q
to their xed point values, to ignore the terms of order (~)2 in the ow equations and to

set the beta functions for the sigma model with target space metric g equal to those for the

sigma model with metric g. one then obtains

l2(~ + q~) = ~(5)
5  c

q2 =

.

(5.18)

(5.19)

the second equation is the equation of motion for the constant part of the shifted dilaton

. to next order, q2 gets a new contribution [17]:

q2 =

5  c(~)

(5.20)

finally, we dene rg time near the xed point (where  = q

appendix b: conformally self-dual gravity

we consider fourdimensional euclidean gravity with action

s = zm

d4x g{ + r + r2 + w 2}

in the limit

w is the weyl tensor, the traceless part of the riemann tensor:

 =  =  = 0 ,   .

w = r 

1

(gr + g r  g r  gr ) +

(gg  g g)r.

the    limit corresponds to an uv xed point, as shown by fradkin and tseytlin [11].
well review the bosonic theory here.

there are two topological invariants in 4d, the euler characteristic  and the signature

 of a manifold

 =

1

482 z d4xg(w 2

+  w 2


)

and

 =

322 z d4xgg.

with gauss-bonnet density

g = r r  4rr + r2

and (anti-) self-dual part of the weyl tensor

w

(w

 w ).

17

so after subtracting a topological invariant   , we end up studying the action [13]

z d4xgw 2
+ ,

   .

in the limit   , the path integral over the metric r dg exp{s} reduces to an
integral over conformally self-dual metrics, i.e., metrics with w+ = 0. w+ has 5 independent

components and the condition w+ = 0 is conformally and dieomorphism invariant. so the

5 remaining components of the metric must be the 4 dieomorphisms and the 4d conformal

factor. in addition, there is an integral over the moduli space of conformally self-dual metrics.

this is a 4d analog of the moduli space of riemann surfaces of 2d gravity. in the simplest

case of s4 topology, there is no moduli space: conformally self-dual metrics are conformally

at,

g = e

up to dieomorphisms . (for k3, e.g., the moduli space is 57-dimensional.) we can split

up uctuations around conformally selfdual metrics as

g = g + () + h.

the limit    can be regarded as the classical limit for the ve other components h
only: the integral over them becomes gaussian and is

det(oo) 1

2

(2.4)

where o is the linearized w+-term, o is its adjoint and oo is a 4th order, conformally in-

variant, linear dierential operator [12]. changing variables from g to  and  and integrating

over  contributes, as in 2d, another jacobian

(det ll)

1

2 .

the determinants det(oo), det(ll), as well as any conformally coupled matter elds

contribute to the conformal anomaly, analogously to 2d. for conformally invariant dierential

operators x:

det xge = det xgesi[g,]

18

where the induced action si is obtained by integrating the trace anomaly of the stress tensor

si[g, ]

= g < t 

2
(there is also a term 2
3ar, but it vanishes for einstein manifolds.) following [24, 12], the
conformal anomaly can be integrated: the 4d analog of the (free part of the) 2d liouville

action is, essentially,

si[g, ] = 

1

322 z d4xqg{ b (2 + g) + a w 2 } .

some coecients a and b are according to fradkin and tseytlin [28] (there, a =

similarly as in 2d [20], we now add the conformal factor  as an independent new matter

(p will play a minor role here) to the theory and demand conformal invariance of the total

theory. this means: i), conformal anomalies have to cancel; ii), scaling operators are dressed

to have dimension 4, etc.

as for i), the free theory for  has conformal anomaly

a = a2 +

where a2, b2 are read o from the table. therefore cancellation of conformal anomalies

a key point, noted by antoniadis and mottola [12], is that due to the 2 kinetic term

for , its propagator is logarithmic and therefore the exponential e2 is a scaling operator,

as in 2d (this is very unusual in 4d). its dimension comes out to be

dim(e) = ( + q)

as in two dimensions, if i is a scaling operator of the matter theory with conformal dimen-

sion i, the operator

with i determined by

oi  z d4xqgeii

i  i(i + q) = 4

is then a scale invariant operator that can be added to the action, at least innitesimally.

we nally mention that there is also an analog of the c = 1 barrier of 2d gravity: instead

of c  1 we have [12]

+360 b  98.

this is usually satised, as b is negative for conventional matter. one can also compute a

scaling law e.g. for the xed volume partition function [13]:

z(v )  v 3.67...
