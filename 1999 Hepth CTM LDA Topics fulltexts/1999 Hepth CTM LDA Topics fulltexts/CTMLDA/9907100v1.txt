abstract

we discuss the relation between the matrix theory denitions of a class of decoupled

theories and their ads/cft description in terms of the corresponding near-horizon ge-

ometry. the near horizon geometry, naively part of the coulomb branch, is embedded in

the higgs branch via a natural change of variables. the principles of the map apply to all

dlcq descriptions in terms of hyper-kahler quotients, such as the adhm quantum me-

chanics for the d1-d5 system. we then focus the (2,0) eld theory, and obtain an explicit
mapping from all states in the n0 = 1 momentum sector of n4 m5-branes to states in (a
dlcq version of) ads7  s4. we show that, even for a single d0-brane, the space-time
coordinates become non-commuting variables, suggesting an inherent non-commutativity

of space-time in the presence of eld strengths even for theories with gravity.

1. introduction

by now we have several non-perturbative formulations of m-theory and string theory

in dierent backgrounds or kinematical set-ups, primarily in the frame work of matrix

theory [1] and the ads/cft correspondence [2]. however it is disappointing, albeit in a

merry way, to go from a situation without any non-perturbative formulations to a situation

with many background-dependent such formulations. one would therefore like a sequence

of maps from one formulation to another. this paper is a preliminary study into the

relation between the ads/cft correspondence and matrix theory in which we will suggest

a derivation of the former given the latter.

more concretely, both matrix theory and the ads/cft correspondence (and its gen-

eralizations) allow us to write down a description of theories which can be obtained from

solitons in string theory/m-theory by decoupling gravity. the range of usefulness of the

two methods is dierent. the advantages of the ads/cft duality is that it can be ex-

hibited for a large class of eld theories/gravity backgrounds, the formulation exhibits all

the symmetries of the theory manifestly, and one can derive some qualitative properties of

eld theories from it. its drawback is that obtaining exact quantitative results is typically

possible only in extreme regimes of the parameters space of the eld theory such that the

gravity background is manageable, which is infrequent. the matrix theory of decoupled

theories on solitons has its limitations as well. one is restricted to a small class of theories,

one looses some of the symmetries and one still needs to take the large null-momentum

limit, which often makes the problem complicated. but when it exists, it exists just as

well for cases where the supergravity is not weakly coupled. for example, using the dlcq

of the (2,0) eld theory it is easy to count precisely [4] chiral operators for every number

of 5-branes but not to compute their ope. whereas using the ads/cft description it

is easy to compute the 3-point function of these operators in the extreme case of a very

large number of 5-branes, but not to count them precisely or compute the ope for a nite

number of 5-branes. a map between the two descriptions will perhaps enable us to enjoy

the advantages of both systems, might allow us to borrow new tools from one description

to be used in the other, or might teach us altogether new things.

in this paper we will suggest that it is natural to consider the ads/cft correspon-

dence within the framework of matrix theory. we emphasize that this direction is opposite

to what was previously done in the literature, which is to interpret matrix theory as a spe-

cial case of an ads/cft-type correspondence. what we will show is that one can clearly

1

identify the near horizon description within the dlcq of the decoupled eld theory. thus,

if one accepts these dlcq conjectures, then the ads/cft correspondence is essentially

a change of basis in the dlcq hilbert space. in this paper we will discuss some basic

aspects of this identication and change of basis, and leave its more extensive elaboration

to the future.

in terms of the dlcq of the decoupled theories on the brane, the problem can be

phrased in terms of the relations between the coulomb and higgs branches of certain

(other) eld theories. these eld theories are those provided by matrix theory as means

of describing the dynamics on the brane prior to the decoupling from the bulk gravity;

we will refer to them as the full dlcq theories. these theories typically have a coulomb

branch, which describes gravity away from the brane, and a higgs branch, which describes

excitations inside the brane. the decoupling limit is, in the language of the full dlcq

theory, the limit in which the higgs branch and the coulomb branch decouple [6][4].

the puzzle now is the following. the theory on the brane has a description in terms

of gravity in the near horizon region of the soliton. semi-classically, however, this region

seems to be part of the coulomb branch of the full dlcq theory since the distance of the

excitation from the brane is not strictly zero. admittedly, it is the tip of the coulomb

branch where it touches the higgs branch, but nevertheless it seems we never enter the

higgs branch.

in order to reconcile these points of view, i.e., to nd the near-horizon

geometry in the higgs branch, one needs to nd some kind of equivalence between the

tip of the coulomb branch and the entire higgs branch in these systems. of course the

problem is in the semiclassical statement and one can excuse oneself by appealing to large

quantum uctuations, but still one would like to do better. this is the purpose of this

paper.

once we have identied the dynamics of gravitons in the near horizon geometry in

terms of dynamics on the higgs branch, we have, in eect, derived the ads/cft duality

from matrix theory.

we will present in this paper only the tip of the iceberg on this map and its properties.

in section two we present the general idea, although we will cast it a form suitable for the

d0-d4 system and the d1-d5 system, which give rise to the dlcq of the (2,0) eld theory

[3] and the dlcq of the little string theory [3][6] respectively. section 3 is a technical

note on the map. in section 4 we begin focusing on the dlcq of the (2,0) eld theory

for a single unit of momentum along the null direction. although in matrix theory one is

instructed to take a large number of units of such momenta, already at the single unit level

2

we will start seeing interesting eects. section 4 sets up the description of this model, and

of what we will call the reduced model which is a avor invariant version of the adhm

quantum mechanics and which will be intimately related to the near horizon geometry.
section 5 discusses the other side of the equation, i.e., the dlcq of ads7  s4 (which
is the supergravity dual of the (2, 0) eld theory). again we specialize to the case of a

single unit of momentum. section 6 nally discusses the details of the map and some of
its features. in particular we will see the signicant appearance of a non-commutative1
version of s4.

2. the near horizon limit in matrix theory

2.1. decoupling in low-dimensional sym

in [3][6] it was argued that the dlcq of the (2,0) eld theory and of the little

string theory are a 1+0 and a 1+1 (respectively) sigma models on certain higgs branches

(which describe instanton moduli spaces). since both cases require a longitudinal 5-brane
[7], the higgs branch in question is in both cases the dimensional reduction of 4d n = 2
theories with u (n0) gauge group, a hypermultiplet in the adjoint and hypermultiplets in a

bi-fundamental of the gauge group and an u (n4) avor symmetry. we will discuss below

each case at greater detail, however the basic scaling that generates the higgs/coulomb

map is common to both and will be the topic of this section.

in our discussion here we will be schematic (we will not write all the couplings and
quantum numbers) 2. prior to decoupling, schematically, the elds in the lagrangian are:

v ector multiplets scalars
v ector multiplets f ermions
adjoint hypermultiplet boson

y1

h

bi  f undamental hypermultiplets bosons
q
 bi  f undamental hypermultiplets f ermions

adjoint hypermultiplet f ermions

as well as gauge elds (in the same multiplet as y1 and ), and the sym action is

z dd

g2

ym(cid:0)(dy1)2 + [y1, y1]2 + (d + [y1, ])(cid:1)+

2 more precise statements can be found below, or in the above references.

in the analysis in [3][6] one takes g2

but the coulomb branch coordinate y1 is always of dimension 1 (hence the notation y1).
ym   keeping the energy xed (or equivalently
ym). if we are on the higgs branch, then the mass of the higgsed
gauge bosons goes to innity and they decouple, leaving us with quantum mechanics

ows to the ir for xed g2

on the higgs branch as the dlcq (since we are in 0+1 or 1+1 dimensions, there are

large uctuations in the ground state and the higgs branch or coulomb branch are not

really moduli spaces of the theory. therefore decoupling is actually not automatic as we

portrayed it. for the dierent arguments for the two cases the reader is referred to the

literature).

let us be a little more precise. in the limit g2

ym   three things happen:

1. the f and d constraints are imposed exactly, giving us a non-linear sigma model.

2. if we are on the higgs branch, and do not rescale the higgs variables as we take
1 q2 + y12 xed we also do not
g2
ym   then the following happens. to keep y 2
perform any gym dependent rescaling on y . the result is that the kinetic term of the

vector multiplet vanishes. these elds become auxiliary elds and we can integrate

them out. this, for example, gives the 4-fermi interaction in the non-linear sigma

model. the value of y1 in terms of the higgs branch variables is determined by the

coupling of y1 in the lagrangian and is therefore given (qualitatively)

1

2{y1, qq + eqeqt} + [h, [h, y1]] = f ermion bi  linear

(2.3)

(the details of the formula change from dimension to dimension since the number of

y1 variables changes)

3. finally, the physical hilbert space is restricted to u (n0) invariant wave functions.

the main point of this paper is the following. it would seem that we have lost all

information about the coulomb branch. we will argue that this is not the case. the

scaling that we have performed gave a nite value to the coordinates y1 as a function of

the higgs branch variables. we have used this fact to integrate out the y1 variables. but

we can also look at things in a dierent way and regard the y1s, which prior to decoupling

4

were coordinates on the coulomb branch, as operators on the higgs branch. suppose we
are given a time varying quantum state on the higgs branch |(t) >, then by computing
(2.4)

y (t) =< (t)|y (q, h, , )|(t) >

we can transform the problem to that of an excitation moving on the coulomb branch. the

operation is nothing but a change of basis to a basis of eigenfunctions of the y1 operators.
what we will show is that given a higgs branch sigma model as a dlcq of some

decoupled high dimension quantum mechanical system, then the y1 coordinates describe a
dlcq version of the near horizon of limit of this system. hence the maldacena conjecture

for these cases is essentially a change of basis in matrix theory.

this will be the main point of the paper, but it is not as straightforward as we have

made it to be. the reason is that the y1 operators do not commute, and therefore we
can not go to a basis of wave functions which are eigenfunctions of all y1s and describe
the system as a particle moving on a new commutative space. rather the new space will

be non-commutative. we will show, however, that in the limit in which the near horizon

geometry becomes at, the non-commutativity disappears. this aspect of the near-horizon

limit is similar to ideas put forward in [18], although the precise relation remains to be

claried.

the construction discussed here is also similar to that of [14]. there also coordinates

analogous to the coulomb branch reappear and become the coordinates which complete

the 4 coordinates of the d3-brane to 10 coordinates of the bulk theory. there is how-

ever a dierence in the sense that here we are discussing the exact quantum mechanical

description in spacetime whereas the computation there applies to leading terms only in

instanton computations. more closely related to the construction there might be an ikkt
type conjecture [19]. the conjecture might be that the exact nite curvature ads5  s5
has an ikkt-like description in terms of the large k limit of k instantons in su (n ), even

for nite n . even though this is conjecture is natural, it is somewhat disturbing. to see

that, let us consider how this conjecture might be proven. the simplest way to relate
the ikkt conjecture to the d = 4, n = 4 eld theory is if in the large thooft coupling
the full eld theoretic path integral is approximated by instanton conguration, and their

vicinity. this is not unlikely, as the action of other congurations is not protected and

it can receive strong corrections and become innity, leaving us only with approximate

instanton congurations. the problem with this is that for small thooft coupling (i.e.,

large curvatures) an ikkt conjecture is implausible, because in that case the path integral

clearly has other contributions.

5

2.2. the matrix description of the (2,0) cft

the matrix model for the 6 dimensional (2,0) superconformal eld theory was dis-

cussed in [3],[4]. in this section we will briey revisit it, in view of the construction from

the previous section. in this case we would like to make some preliminary contact with

the near horizon limit of this theory [2].

the n0 units of momenta matrix model for n4 longitudinal 5-branes coupled to 11d

supergravity is discussed in [7][3]. the lagrangian of the quantum mechanics is

the lagrangians (2.5) and (2.2) are related by setting

ym = r3m 6

p

and by rescaling of elds. in particular

y1 = rm 3

p y1.

(2.5)

(2.6)

(2.7)

y1 is the distance transverse to the brane (in the canonical metric, before we took

into account the back-reaction of the brane). in the near horizon limit [2] of the (2,0) eld

theory we rescale this coordinate such that a dimension 2 combination

ynh = m 3

p y1

remains nite. we see that the relation is

ynh =

1
r

y1,

(2.8)

which implies that a nite y1 coordinate is equivalent to a nite ynh. therefore, in the

sym decoupling limit it is precisely the near horizon coordinate which remains nite and

is given as an operator on the higgs branch (r is kept xed throughout).

2.3. the matrix description of the little string theory

the matrix description of the 6 dimensional little string theory [10][11][9] was dis-

cussed in [3] and [6]. let us begin with the model before we go the little string theory

decoupling limit [9]. the model is the 1+1 dimensional model discussed above, on a

cylindrical worldsheet with radius

1 =

where fms is the mass scale associated with the little string theory, and the sym coupling

is

where mp is the 11 dimensional planck scale which is taken to innity, keeping fms and r

xed.

as before the dimension 1 y1 coordinate is xed in terms of the higgs branch variables
as we go to the decoupling limit. again, this coordinate is related to the dimension -1

coordinate by

y1 =

y1

rm 3
p

.

(2.11)

this is exactly the correct scaling which is required to focus on the near horizon limit of

the supergravity dual of the little string theory [12]. again we see that the nite y1
coordinate is precisely the quantity which focuses on the near-horizon limit.

we will devote the rest of this paper to the d0-d4 case.

it is easy for formulate,

however, the expected results for the d1-d5 as well. one expects that (in the rr sector)

the y s as functions of the higgs branch variables will dene operators that will be the

coordinates of the dlcq of the near horizon limit of the ns 5-brane - i.e., the linear
dilaton background capped by ads7  s4 [12]. in particular, to generate weakly coupled
string perturbation theory in the linear dilaton region one needs to go to the long string

in the sense of [13]. the relevant winding number will now be given by the winding of the

y1 composite operator.

the reappearance of the coulomb branch is particularly interesting for the d1-d5 in

view of [22] (the system there is not precisely the one we are discussing here there but is
clearly related. there it is the instanton moduli space on t 4 (which does not have a nite

dimensional hyperkahler quotient construction) and here we are discussing the instanton
moduli space on r4).

it was shown there that associated with the singularities in the

7

sigma model target space there is a new continuum of states in the cft, suggesting a kind

of tube. we see here that there is a natural way of regenerating this tube (although the

precise relation is not clear).

we have specialized to the cases of the (2,0) eld theory and of the little string

theory. there are other cases, however, in which theories are given by the decoupling of

higgs and coulomb branches, and we expect that our approach will be just as valid there.
most other examples, such as 4d n = 4, are given in terms of an impurity system (for
example [20]). the procedure outlined above should work just as well, except that we will

also need to use dlcq open string eld theory (this will be the general case for theories

on d-branes). this issue will be discussed in [21].

3. more on the map

we have seen that the near horizon coulomb coordinate can be thought of as an

operator on the higgs branch sigma model. this operator is determined by the equations

of motion of y . the equation of y is of the form

ly [ab] = [ab]

where  is a fermion bi-linear and l is

we therefore need to discuss the invertibility of l.

1

ly =

2{y, qq + eqeqt} + [hn, [hn, y ]].

following [14][15], it is straightforward to show that the operator is non-negative, on

(3.1)

the space of hermitian matrices. this can be seen by the fact that
+ |[hn, ]|2.

t r(cid:0)l(cid:1) = |q|2 + |eq|

2

using the equation it is also easy to see that l is not invertible only at singular points on
the adhm moduli space, i.e., points where parts of the u (n0) is restored. the reason is
that if l has a zero eigenvalue, then the corresponding (perhaps a few) eigenvectors  are

hermitian matrices such that exp(i) is a subgroup of u (n0) which leaves q, eq and hn

invariant.

hence at generic points of the moduli space, the map is invertible. it will be interesting

to study further the behavior of the map as one approaches one of the singular points. for

example, some of these singularities correspond to instantons shrinking to zero size. as
we approach such a point, the inverted operator l1 will diverge which corresponds to
at least one eigenvalue in the y coordinate going to . this is to be expected from the
uv/ir relation [16]. since this describes a point like object in the eld theory, it will be
associated with an excitation of the bulk at y approaching .

8

3.1. the uv/ir relation and the origin of the higgs branch

let us elaborate somewhat the relation between (2.3) and the uv/ir relation [16].

although the following discussion follows from conformal invariance, and thus not really a

test of the map, it does demonstrate some interesting aspects of the map.

the so(5) quantum numbers of a state can only be carried by the fermion bi-linear

terms on the rhs (since bosons on the lhs do not carry so(5) quantum numbers).

suppose we x these quantum numbers, i.e., we x the rhs (in the sense of its action on

a state). now consider making the state smaller and smaller in 4 remaining coordinates

of the brane (transverse to time and to the null circle directions). this means that the

values of the lhs get smaller and smaller. when we solve for y1, i.e., the position of the
excitation in ads7 (with xed the quantum numbers on the s4), then it increases. i.e., as
the object becomes more and more localized, its image in ads7 approaches the boundary
y  .

the map (2.3) in eect seems to regulate the singularity at the origin of the higgs

branch (neglecting the decoupled center of mass coordinate) since it maps it to the bound-

ary of ads, which is regular. furthermore, from this point of view it is natural to have the

6d tensor multiplet of the m5-branes at the boundary of ads, since in the higgs branch

picture one can locate the corresponding state at the origin of the higgs branch. natural

in this context means that, if we would blow up the singularity, this state mixes with all

the rest [4].

4. the higgs branch for a single d0 brane

the d0-d4 system is easier to analyze and we will focus on it. we have seen that

for all n4 and n0 there are operators on the higgs branch which are the coordinates on
the near horizon space-time. in the remainder of this paper we will focus on the case of
n0 = 1. even though the matrix theory limit requires n0   for xed n4, this simple
case demonstrates some important aspects of the construction3.

3 it is actually particularly interesting to better understand the map for n0 > 1 in the limit
that both n0 and n4 are taken to innity. this limit might be useful in understanding the

structure of the bound state of (only) the d0-branes. we are able to map the higgs branch to

dynamics on the coulomb branch with arbitrarily low curvature (set by n4). in particular, there

exist states on the higgs branch which correspond to the bound states of d0-branes in the near

horizon coulomb branch. this map, therefore, maps a rather complicated non-abelian problem

9

4.1. quantum mechanics on the adhm moduli space

the eld content of the adhm moduli space for n0 = 1 and arbitrary n4 is the

immediate). generally, , .. will denote su (2)r, i, j.. will denote u (n4) indices and

a, b, .. will denote spinor spin(5) indices (w is what we called q before).

to a problem in a sigma model with no non-abelian gauge dynamics. for example, proving the

existence of these states on the higgs branch is simpler then proving their existence in at space

matrix theory [17]. in fact, the counting can be easily done for any n4 and n0 [5] (and adapted

for matrix theory purposes in [4]). as we take n0   the bound state on the near horizon

coulomb branch expands in the coulomb branch coordinates. to approach the at space limit

we also need to take n4  , such that the size of the bound state is always smaller then the

radius of curvature of ads. in this case we can regard the wave functions on the sigma model as

a regulated version of the bound state in at space, and we can remove the regulator at will.

10

although we will discuss in a moment the solution to these equations when we x the

u (n4) symmetry, let us rst proceed more generally. as in [14], it is convenient to classify
the solutions to the linear constraint (4.4) in the following way. one class of solutions,
which we will denote by b
k , k = 1..n4  2, satises that  and w are orthogonal (in avor

indices, for every a and ). the second class of solutions is given by

(4.5)

(4.6)

regarding this higgs branch as the moduli space of instantons these are nothing but the

superconformal zero modes.

4.2. the reduced model

we are interested in mapping states in this quantum mechanics to states on the near

horizon coulomb branch. there is, however, an obstacle which is that many states on the

higgs branch carry u (n4) quantum numbers, which clearly does not exist on the coulomb
branch side. we will therefore restrict ourselves to states that are invariant under u (n4).
this is compatible with (2.3), which is also u (n4) invariant4.

to discuss states that are invariant under u (n4) (and under u (1)gauge), it is con-
venient to dene a reduced quantum mechanics, which is the quantum mechanics on a

hilbert space of avor invariant states (as well as gauge invariant, of course). actually we

will x the gauge only partially and work with a larger hilbert space, to which we will

also refer at times as the reduced hilbert space. the procedure that we will adopt is to

gauge x the bosonic part of the hypermultiplets. a convenient choice of gauge will be

 =(cid:18) q 0

0 q 0 .. 0(cid:19).

0 .. 0

wj

(4.7)

it is clear that gauge and avor invariant functions can be thought of as functions of a single

variable q, but with as many fermions as we had before, i.e., this space has a single bosonic
coordinate, 8 fermionic coordinates  and 4(n4  2) complex pairs of fermions a

the commutation relation on the remaining fermions can still be taken to be the

canonical ones:

(4.8)

the reduced hilbert space

we start with a model that has su (n4)global  u (1)gauge symmetry. the u (1)gauge
is the diagonal of the u (n4) that acts on the hypermultiplets. after we go to the special
gauge above the remaining symmetry is su (n4  2)f lavor  u (1)gauge. we are interested
in states which are invariant under all these symmetries. clearly q and  are invariant
under these symmetries, hence all the restrictions will be in the    fock space. there
are two states in this fock space, |+ > and | >, which satisfy

a
k | > = 0,

k
a|+ > = 0.

(4.9)

these states are exchanged under   , hence their natural u (1) charge assignment will
be opposite. if we set the u (1) gauge charge of  to 1, then |+ > has charge 2(n4  2).
the requirement of gauge invariance then tells us that we are restricted to states of the
form 2(n42)|+ >. furthermore, since all the indices on the  operators are that of a
fundamental index, we can only contract them by a baryonic vertex. the hilbert space of

gauge invariant and avor invariant functions is therefore of the form

we have seen that the structure of the hilbert space is simple enough. one would

like to know whether reducing in this way has not made the dynamics, as encoded by

the hamiltonian or supercharges, too complicated. fortunately, the price that we pay

for reducing is minimal. in the full adhm quantum mechanics avor invariance is the

equation

(t a

bos + t a

f erm)(w, w, , ) = 0,

(4.11)

12

where a is an u(n ) index, t a

f er is the action on
the fermions. (4.11) equates derivatives with respect to w, w (along orbits of the avor

bos is the action on the bosons and t a

symmetry) with fermionic bi-linear operators acting on the states. we can now replace the

bosonic derivatives in these directions with fermion bi-linear operators. the only bosonic

derivative that will be left is in the q direction. we have, however, generated new fermion

tri-linear terms, but since the original supercharges also contained tri-linear fermion terms,

this does not complicate the system (a toy example of this reduction procedure is discussed

in appendix 1).

given the supercharges of the initial adhm quantum mechanics we can determine

the supercharges of the reduced system. alternatively since we know that the supercharges

have at most tri-linear fermion terms we can compute them explicitly by requiring closure

of the supersymmetry algebra. the supercharges are computed in this way in appendix 2,

and the result is

where l is the so(5) generator in the    sector, m is the su (2)r generator on 
(for precise conventions see appendix 2), and a is a specic constant which we have not

determined since will we not require it.

5. dlcq of the poincare patch of ads7  s4

we would like to perform a dlcq quantization of m-theory on ads7s4. the correct
and full dlcq of this background is of course the quantum mechanics on the adhm

moduli space. we would like, however, to start with this spacetime and try and write

an approximate dlcq description of that. this step, however, is somewhat problematic.

we can not try and write a dlcq for the entire full cover, because this space does not

have any null isometries. however, the poincare patch has a null isometry. if we use the
coordinates u, x i, i = 0..5 then we can mod out by the symmetry x+  x+ + r. the
problem now is that, since there is a xed point, the quotient is singular at u = 0. away

from the singularity we can write a dlcq, which will be a nite dimensional quantum

mechanics. as we approach the xed point of the null translation, the quantum mechanics

will become singular. this may invalidate the whole approach but we will argue that this

is not the case. having a singularity in the hamiltonian of the dlcq is not a source for

13

concern as long as one asks the right questions. there is, for example, no point in asking

what is the ground state of the quantum mechanics, but if the hamiltonian is a good

dierential operator on functions supported away from the singularity, then it is a sensible

question to ask what is the dynamics of a wave packet there.

we will restrict our attention to the dlcq for n0 = 1, i.e., for a single unit of
momentum along the null circle. in this case the model is a quantum mechanical sigma

model, which describes the motion of the gravity multiplet on this background. taking
the metric of ads7  s4 to be5

up to a shift in the mass and an r-dependent rescaling on . not surprisingly, this is the

same as the metric that a d0 sees near a d4 brane, when we rescale the coordinates as we

go to the m5-near horizon limit.

the full lagrangian of a d0 away from a d4 brane was determined, to lowest order in
derivative expansion, in [8]. in addition to a decoupled r4 (associated with the hypermul-
tiplet h which is decoupled for n0 = 1) there are 5 coordinates u i (u 2 = u i2
) which6
parameterize 5 coordinates transverse to the brane, i.e, one radial coordinate and the four
of s4. the most general form of an so(5) invariant lagrangian is given in equation (3.10)
in [8], and it is:

f (u )(cid:0) u j u j + i(  +  )(cid:1) + u if,j(ij) +

1

2(cid:0)fij  f 1f,if,j(cid:1)(ii + ii) (5.1)

5 we use the coordinate r which is proportional to the distance from the brane in the uncor-

rected metric

6 generally the letter u will denote commuting coordinates on the coulomb branch. y i denotes

the non-commuting ones.

14

where  (which is denoted in [8] by ) is a 4 of u sp(2) and  and  together form a doublet
of su (2)r. the most general f (u ) allowed by the (super)symmetries is f = c0 + c1
u 3 . this
is the metric that a d0 brane sees near a d4-brane (for proper c0,1). when we take
mp  , and properly normalize the u coordinates as to go to the near horizon limit, we
obtain that the function f is given by

f (u ) =

n4
p u 3 .
rm 3

(5.2)

in section 6.5 we will partially match terms in the supercharges for this system with

terms in the supercharges of the adhm sigma model. the term which is most interesting
to match is the one that contains derivatives with respect to u i because transforming this

term into a higgs branch expression will rely most heavily on the maps from the higgs to

the coulomb branch. the u term appears in the coulomb branch supercharges as

q

a = u

(5.3)

one more point is in order. we have restricted ourselves to n0 = 1. one can ask
whether there is a generalization of this formula to larger values of n0. there are several
ways to try and obtain approximate answers but, since there is no established supersym-

metric non-renormalizaton theorem for these cases, we will not explore this generalization

here. one thing is clear, however: when the quanta that carry dlcq momenta are close

to each other (compared to the scale set by the curvature of space-time) we should ap-
proximately obtain the n = 16 bfss lagrangian as a limit of the adhm sigma model.

6. higgs coulomb equivalence

6.1. the coordinate algebra

the relation (2.3) denes a set of operators y [ab] which are coordinates on the near

horizon coulomb branch as operators on the higgs branch. this relation is valid for all

n0 and n4. for the case n0 = 1 this relation simplies signicantly and becomes

y [ab] =

k k
a

f j bf  b

k k

cj ac + 1
q2

2 j abf

k k
f

(6.1)

where the sum over k is k = 1..n (n = n4  2). using this formula we would like to study
in greater detail how the correspondence works.

15

the equation (6.1) denes the operators y in terms of q2 and in terms of the fun-
damental fermions. in the context of ads7  s4 we should think of the 5 y coordinates
as r+  s4, where the r+, which we will denote as u , is associated with the additional
coordinate of ads7. we will see below that

2(n )
q2

,

u 

(6.2)

and the s4 manifold (which becomes fuzzy) is related to the fermion bi-linear. we therefore

begin by focusing on the fermion bi-linear terms.

before doing so, it is useful to list the main objects that we will be dealing with, which

is the following algebra of coordinates, and some of the relations between them:

1. the avor invariant coordinates:

where ... are terms which are symmetric under l1  l2 or k1  k2 and, as will be clear
below, will not play a role in our analysis. these operators and the relations between them

are the structures which organize the correspondence for the n0 = 1 case.

note equation (6.9) which encodes the non-commutativity of the coordinates. the

non-commutativity is closely related to the truncation of the spectrum of kk states on
s4, and since in the adhm quantum mechanics the spectrum of chiral operators truncates

correctly for every n4 and n0 we expect that this non-commutativity will persist (in some

form) even in this limit. this implies that spacetime becomes non-commutative even for

closed strings in the presence of a closed string eld strength. the length scale associated

with this non-commutativity may be much smaller than the string scale, but since d-branes

can probe sub-stringy structures, they can still resolve it, which is another interpretation

of our results for the d0-d4 system.

6.2. mapping of states

the fermi surface

the purpose of this section is to show how the operators of the coordinate algebra
organize the states of the reduced system. we will show that the 5 bab operators organize
these states in the same way that the 5 commutative coordinates of r5 organize the

spherical harmonics on the unit sphere.

the class of relevant states is given in (4.10). each baryonic contraction ....a1

.

..an

.

is the n-th tensor symmetric representation of the 4 of u sp(2). therefore all the states

are in the product of two such representations. in particular there is an u sp(2) singlet

state given by

| > = l1..ln t1..tn b0

l1t1..b0

ln tn|+ >

(6.13)

17

this state corresponds to the lowest spherical harmonic, i.e., the constant function on the

sphere.

we will refer to this state as the fermi surface. the reason is that all higher

spherical harmonics will be given as excitations of this state, in a similar way to exciting

a fermion from below a fermi surface to a level above it.

higher spherical harmonics

the rest of the spherical harmonics on s4 match with states in the fock space by the

following correspondence. suppose we are given a j-th symmetric traceless tensor of so(5)

which we will write in u sp(2) conventions as v[a1b1]..[ajbj ], then the map (6.1) implies

v[a1b1]..[ajbj ]u [a1b1]...u [ajbj ]  v[a1b1]..[ajbj ]b[a1b1]...b[ajbj ]| > =

we have restricted the v s to live in a single irreducible representation. if we allow

general v then the relation is still correct as long as we do not use on the lhs the relation
u 2 = const, but leave it as an operator u 2. the reason is that b2 evaluated on the

dierent wave function on the rhs is not a constant (although for large n the corrections
are roughly suppressed by powers of j
n - this will be discussed further in section 6.4). if
we would allow a general v above and use u 2 = const then each representation would be
over-dened (by all v s with a larger number of vector indices), and the inequality of b2

on the dierent representations would make the denitions incompatible.

counting of states

we would like to show that all the states (4.10) are in 1-1 correspondence with spherical

harmonics, and that the spectrum truncates at the correct place. the last statement is

easy to verify and should comes as no surprise since the adhm quantum mechanics gives

the correct spectrum of chiral operators [4]. the state with the largest number of avor

charged coordinates has n such coordinates

........ba1b1

..

..ban bn

..

|+ >

so there are overall n4  1 spherical harmonics functions in the spectrum. this exactly
matches the expected truncation of states on the s4 from the (2, 0) cft point of view (a
truncation similar to the truncation to t rx 2, .., t rx n3 for ads5  s5).

18

supergravity is, in a sense, given by the quantum mechanics of the system (5.1).

indeed there we do not see any truncation of the spectrum. however, the full non-

perturbative formulation, which is the adhm qm, includes the correct cut-o.

next we would like to show that all the states in (4.10) are generated by acting with

the coordinate algebra on the fermi surface. we regard the states in (4.10) as living in

the product of two n -th symmetric tensor products of 4s of u sp(2). to examine what

representation appears in this product, its enough to choose a xed vector of our choice in

one of the representations. we will chose this state to be such that all the u sp(2) indices

are 1. the relevant class of states is therefore

l1..ln t1..tn 1

l1 ..1

ln 2

t1 ..2
tn2

3
tn2+1 ..3

tn2+n3

4
tn2+n3+1 ..4

tn|+ >

it is clear, however, that this state equals

l1..ln t1..tn b12

l1t1..b12

ln2 tn2

b13

ln2+1tn2+1 ..b13

ln2n3 tn2+n3

b14

ln2+n3+1tn2+n3+1 ..b14

ln tn|+ >

hence all the states in (4.10) are generated by the coordinate algebra.

now that we have identied states which correspond to the spherical harmonics and

operators which can play the role of coordinates, we can examine the correspondence more

carefully. we would now like to address the questions

1. is the map (6.14) unitary ?

2. what is the size of the sphere ?

3. to what extent are the bs coordinates on a sphere ?

the answer that we will obtain is that for low lying kaluza-klein spherical harmonics,
the map is unitary, the states correspond to spherical harmonics on a sphere of radius 2n
and the bs act as coordinates. fortunately, low-lying kaluza-klein states for our purposes

certainly include all states with wavelength larger the planck scale.

6.3. the dilute gas approximation

this section will touch upon some aspects of the coordinate algebra in the dilute gas

approximation. this approximation is the leading term for j << n where j is the level of
the spherical harmonics (we will show that the leading correction is actually j/n  where
  o(1),  < 1 will be determined in the next subsection).

the dilute gas approximation is the following. for every j the state is given by

l1..ln t1..tn ba1b1

l1t1

...bajbj

ljtj

19

b0

lj+1tj+1 ..b0

ln tn|+ >

in the limit j << n most of the bs are b0. in this approximation whenever a computation
receives a contribution both from bab

lt we will neglect the former, since
the contribution from such term will be proportional to j vs. contributions from the 2nd
term which will be proportional to n  j.

and from the b0

lt

within this approximation we lose the non-commutativity in the system, and hence

the following things happen:

1. the map

vi1..ij u i1..u ij  vi1..ij bi1 ..bij| >

 (2n )jvi1..ij l1..ln t1..tn bi1

l1t1

...bij
ljtj

b0

lj+1tj+1 ..b0

ln tn|+ >

becomes exact even for v s which are not irreducible.

2. the operators bab are now commuting. the action of bab on the states is now

bab|(a1b1)..(ajbj) >  2n|(ab)(a1b1)(a2b2)..(ajbj) >

and correspondingly

3. the states move on a sphere of radius 2n .

[bab, bcd]|(a1b1)..(ajbj) > = 0

jaa jbb babbab

|(a1b1)..(ajbj) > 

 n 2jaa jbb|(a1b1)(a2b2)..(ajbj)(ab)(ab) > =

= 8n 2|(a1b1)(a2b2)..(ajbj) >,

which implies a xed radius of the sphere

ibi2

= 2n 2

(6.15)

(this is related to but not precisely the radius of the sphere as seen in supergravity.

to compare with that one needs to compute the hamiltonian or the supercharges.

although we will briey discuss the supercharges below, we will not touch upon this

point).

20

6.4. an exact computation

to examine the departures from the dilute gas approximation we would like to perform
an exact computation of things such as the norms, < b2 > etc. it will be sucient to

do so in a single state in each irreducible representation. the states that are the most

convenient to use are the states

|n >= b13n

| >, < n| =< |b24n

.

as mentioned above, in a 5-vector notation b13 = b1 + ib2 = b24. therefore b13n will
generate a state already in the symmetric, traceless rep. of so(5).

we would rst like to evaluate corrections to the norms of the states, vs. the norms
of a state moving on a commuting s4. on the classical geometry side (on the unit sphere)

(we will use the coordinates u here to denote ordinary commuting coordinates on the unit

sphere)

or in a form which will be more useful

21

as before the leading size of the sphere is ibi2
= 2n 2 and the correction to the classical
recursion relation is suppressed by a factor of n2/n . as we compute the norm using the
recursion relation we accumulate errors yielding an error in the norm of |n > of the order
of

n3
n.

(6.16)

we have seen this number before. it is the momentum expansion of m-theory. the size of
the s4 is r  lpn 1/3 using this relation the expression (6.16) becomes

(cid:18) p
mp(cid:19)3

.

this is to be expected since for modes for which low energy supergravity is legitimate we

should see only small deviations from the behavior of wave functions on a xed sphere.

next we would like to evaluate the expectation value b2 as seen by the n-th spherical

the radius of the sphere is therefore given by

)).

6.5. the denition of u

we have seen that on the relevant states

and what are the corrections to this equation. the full denition of the 5 coordinates

implies

y ab

iy i2

2n 2
q4 .



(6.17)

we could leave the matter at that, i.e., have 5 non-commuting variables, but since

spacetime factorizes into a sphere and the radial coordinate which become part of the ads7
we will use the b operators as constrained coordinates on s4 and dene an additional

commuting coordinate u by

2n
q2 .

u =

(6.18)

the advantage of this denitions is that all the non-commutativity is associated with parts
of space which carry the ux, i.e., the s4, whereas the ads7 is a regular commutative
sigma model. this enforces the claim that in some cases there is a fuzziness in spacetime

associated with eld non-zero eld strengths.

6.6. mapping of supercharges

we have seen that there is a natural identication of states on the higgs branch as

states on the near-horizon coulomb branch. we would now like to begin addressing the

issue of dynamics, i.e., can we see that the dynamics on the higgs branch is mapped to

the expected dynamics on the coulomb branch. to do so we would like to show how the

supercharges of the two systems are related. in this section we will partially show how the

supercharges on the coulomb branch are mapped onto the supercharges of the reduced

model, after we rewrite the coulomb branch coordinates in term of higgs branch variables.

in the process we will also need to discuss the transformation laws of the remaining fermions

from the near-horizon coulomb branch (where we denoted them by ) to the higgs branch

(where we denoted them by ).

the supersymmetry generators along the coulomb (5.3) branch contain the term

3

u

2 

bi

caj bc 
u i

(6.19)

(we will neglect r, mp and n4 dependence). we will show that under the map (6.1) this

term becomes some of the terms in the supercharges of the higgs branch.

23

replacing the commuting coordinate u by the non-commutative denition (6.1) is

ambiguous because of ordering issues. the dierence should be terms suppressed by powers

of 1/n and therefore beyond the scope of the supercharges (5.3) anyhow (which are just

the leading (in derivatives) terms in the lagrangian). more practically, we will manipulate

the u variables as commuting variables in the coulomb branch supercharges for as long

as possible.

we can now transcribe this expression to the higgs branch variables:

1. using the relation u  1/q2, the rst term becomes


aq

which is one of the terms on the higgs branch.
2. the 2nd expression can be simplied further. the expression j
ca can give us
two kinds of terms with dierent quantum numbers. one which is proportional to ij jda
which is zero because u lu ilijjl = 0 and another which is proportional to ij
da. the
latter is multiplied by

dbj bcl

u lu ilij  u ju ilil

where we have anti-symmetrized on l  j. this, however, equals u 2ljl on all spherical
harmonics. the key to the transcription now is to identify the so(5) generators l on
the coordinates of s4 as the so(5) generators l on the -fermion (which is the full so(5)
generator on the reduced system). furthermore, we write u 2 in terms of q, and obtain
precisely the l term in (4.12).

24

7. discussion

we have seen that for quantum theories that are obtained as a decoupled higgs branch

there is a natural change of variables to the coulomb branch. when these theories are

viewed as dlcq descriptions of decoupled theories in m/string theory, then this change

of variables is nothing but the ads/cft correspondence (and its generalizations to non-

conformal cases). this is not surprising since the higgs branch quantum mechanics is

believed to be the full dlcq of these theories, but what is a pleasant surprise is that this

change of variables, and hence the ads/cft correspondence, is fairly straightforward in

terms of the decoupling process.

since the full dlcq is valid in all cases, even large curvature or large higher genus

corrections, we can use it to explore gravity in these cases. the most striking feature that
we have found in this paper is that in the case of ads7  s4 the 4-sphere becomes a non-
commutative space (we have shown this for the n0 = 1 case but we expect it to be true
more generally). it is known that open strings generate a non-commutative structure when
turning on eld strengths on d-branes7 [23], but the status of turning on eld strengths in
the closed string/m-theory sector (which in our case is a ux on s4) was less clear. our

results suggest that in this case also a similar fuzziness of space appears.

8. appendix 1.

in this appendix we discuss a particularly simple case of reducing a model. this will

serve to explain which operations are allowed in the reduced model and which are not.

the toy model contains 3 real bosonic coordinates and 3 complex fermionic coordinates

x 1,2,3, 1,2,3, 

1,2,3

and is invariant under the obvious so(3):

q = ii, q = 

i

i

7 one usually turns on a b eld in the bulk but we can gauge it to a eld strength on the

brane.

25

the so(3) generators are

m ij = x ij  x ji + i

j

i

 j

we are interested in reducing the model with respect so(3). the wave functions satisfy
m ij = 0. this implies that for j = 2, 3:

j =

1

x 1(cid:0)x j1  1

j

+ j

1(cid:1)

since we will insert this expression every time there will be a derivative j we can take the
limit x 2, x 3 = 0 without worry. (note for example that we can not use this formula to
compute, for example, [i, x j] because x j is not so(3) invariant. but we can compute
things like [j, x 2] = 2x j).

this gives us supercharges

q = 11  j 1

q = 11  

x 1(cid:0)1
x 1(cid:0)1

j

1(cid:1) = 1(1 + j

)

it is easy to verify that {q, q} = 0. to evaluate the hamiltonian we anti-commute
{q, q}. even though we started with an hamiltonian that did not contain fermion oscil-
lators, the new hamiltonian does. still, the change is only the generation of new 3-fermion

terms in the supercharges.

9. appendix 2

in this appendix we will (partially) determine the supercharges of the reduced higgs

branch quantum mechanics. one can compute the supercharges of the full adhm sigma

model and then compute the reduced supercharges. alternatively, since the supercharges

are determined by the (super)symmetries of the problem, one can compute them in the

reduced model directly, which is the route we will take. we will show that the supercharges

are (for some conventions see appendix 3)

as usual in the hamiltonian formalism one rst writes down the most general su-

percharge and then xes it by requiring closure on the hamiltonian. the most general

supercharge (setting the coecient of derivative term to 1) is given by

this hamiltonian is determined in the following way

1. the powers of q in front of each term are determined by scale invariance under which

the fermion operators have dimension 0.
ad

2. one might think to add a term 1

q 

k k

d, but as explained above, this number is a

constant in the relevant sector and therefore can be absorbed into a.

3. otherwise one uses su (2)r  u sp(2)  su (n ) symmetry where the last component

is the remaining avor symmetry after reducing the model.

we will be interested in computing the 4-fermi term in the anti-commutator of two

supercharges, and require that the result is a singlet under all the global symmetries. this
will determine8 c1, c2 and b. the 4-fermi terms that we might generate are , 
and .

8 we have not calculated the 2-fermi term, hence we can not compute a. the system of

equations for the other coecient is over-determined

27

since we will be interested in 4-fermi terms we can anti-commute fermion freely,

neglecting the c-number that results, since it will appear as part of the 2-fermi term.

where = denotes that we have neglected terms that are already singlets under su (2)r 

u sp(2).

this expression is an su (2)r singlet, in which case it is either in the 1 or 5 of u sp(2),
and an su (2)r triplet, in which case it is in the 10 of u sp(2). we require the cancelation
of the (1, 5) and (3, 10) terms.

to extract the (1, 5) terms we contract the expression with  and obtain

b = 1.

the solution b = 0 is of course also a valid solution, however, one easily sees that this can

not be the right solution - already at n4 = 2 we have a 3- term in the supercharges.

to extract the (3, 10) term we symmetrize a  a and obtain

clear that the result will be proportional to a singlet of su (2)r, i.e., to

we would like to ask what are the conditions on c1 and c2 such that this expression

is a singlet of u sp(2). to do this, its enough to examine special cases.
a = 1, a = 3. in this case we obtain the expression (j 12 = j 34 = 1)

each term in this expression contain either 23 or 41. to show under what conditions
its zero its enough to focus on terms containing one of this 2-fermion elements, say 23.

there are several ways for this to be zero. the simple one is to set c1 + c2 = 0. in

this case the expression vanishes. this is however not the only way. another way is to set

c1 = c2. the reason is that we do not really need to require that the expression vanishes

29

identically, rather it should vanish only on the avor invariant gauge invariant states in

our hilbert space. as explained in section 4.2 these states are of the form

on these states b

are not really 4-fermi terms. hence the term which is proportional to c1c2 does not
contribute. similarly we can substitute (setting c1 = c2)

k (with a xed coecient). therefore terms containing b

which is again a 2-fermi operator on the relevant hilbert space.

the solution which is correct is actually c1 = c2.

in this case, the two  terms

be before we proceed it is worth returning to the u sp(2)su (2)r singlet terms which
we have been neglecting left and right. these terms do not give us any restrictions on the
supercharges but they are part of the hamiltonian. the 22 term in the hamiltonian

turns out to be proportional to
