abstract

four-dimensional n -extended superconformal symmetry and correlation functions
of quasi-primary superelds are studied within the superspace formalism. a super-
conformal killing equation is derived and its solutions are classied in terms of su-
pertranslations, dilations, lorentz transformations, r-symmetry transformations and
special superconformal transformations. in general, due to the invariance under su-
pertranslations and special superconformal transformations, superconformally invari-
ant n-point functions reduce to one unspecied (n  2)-point function which must
transform homogeneously under the remaining rigid transformations, i.e. dilations,
lorentz transformations and r-symmetry transformations. based on this result, we
are able to identify all the superconformal invariants and obtain the general form
of n-point functions for scalar superelds. in particular, as a byproduct, a selection
rule for correlation functions is derived, the existence of which in n = 4 super yang-
mills theory was previously predicted in the context of ads/cft correspondence [1].
superconformally covariant dierential operators are also discussed.

1 introduction & summary

superconformal eld theories have been of renewed attention after the maldacena conjec-
ture that the string/m theory on adsd+1 backgrounds is dual to a conformal eld theory in
a spacetime of dimension, d, which is interpreted as the boundary of adsd+1 [24]. as all
the known nontrivial conformal eld theories in higher than two dimensions are supersym-
metric theories [516], it is natural to consider a group which combines supersymmetry and
conformal symmetry together, i.e. the superconformal group. in fact, the pioneering work
on supersymmetry in four-dimensions [17] introduced the n = 1 superconformal symmetry,
though it is broken at quantum level.

contrary to the ordinary conformal symmetry, not all spacetime dimensions allow su-
perconformal symmetry. the standard supersymmetry algebra admits an extension to a
superconformal algebra only if d  6 [18] (for a review see [19]).
in particular in four-
dimensions, which is of our interest in this paper, the bosonic part of the superconformal
algebra is

o(2, 4)  u(n ) .

(1.1)

hence the four-dimensional superconformal group is identied with a supermatrix group,
su(2, 2|n ) [20, 21] or its complexication, sl(4|n ; c) [22, 23]. normally n  5 cases are
excluded from the renormalization point of view, as theories with more than four super-
charges must have spins higher than one such as graviton/gravitino and it is unlikely that
supergravity theories are renormalizable. however, such a restriction on the value of n is
not relevant to our work.

according to the conjecture [24], four-dimensional n = 4 super yang-mills theory
with gauge group su(n) is dual to type iib string theory on ads5  s5 in the limit of
small gy m and large but xed t hooft coupling, g2
y m n. in this limit, the string theory can
be eectively described by tree level type iib supergravity, while the eld theory dual is
strongly coupled. as the perturbative approach breaks down in the strongly coupled cft
side, to check the conjectured duality it is desirable to have non-perturbative understand-
ing on super yang-mills theory. this motivates us to explore four-dimensional n -extended
superconformal symmetry and correlation functions subject to the symmetry as done in the
present paper.

in our previous work [21], six-dimensional (n , 0) superconformal symmetry was ana-
lyzed in terms of coordinate transformations on superspace and through dimensional re-
duction basic features of four-dimensional n -extended superconformal symmetry were ob-
tained. in the present paper, in a similar fashion to [21,24] but in a self-contained manner,
we analyze four-dimensional n -extended superconformal symmetry on superspace. our
main results concern the general forms of superconformally invariant n-point functions for

1

quasi-primary superelds. in particular, as a byproduct, we obtain a selection rule for cor-
relation functions of the component elds, i(x), appearing in the power series expansions
of quasi-primary superelds in grassmann coordinates,  and . the selection rule states
that if the the sum of the r-symmetry charge, i, is not zero then the correlation function
of the component elds vanishes

n (xn)i = 0

if

nxi=1

i 6= 0 .

(1.2)

the existence of this kind of selection rule in n = 4 super yang-mills theory was previously
predicted by intriligator within the context of ads/cft correspondence, as the dual iib
supergravity contains a corresponding u(1) symmetry [1]. therefore our results provide a
supporting evidence for the maldacena conjecture, as the selection rule here is derived by
purely considering the symmetry on cft side without referring to the string side.

the contents of the present paper are as follows.

in section 2, we rst dene the
four-dimensional n -extended superconformal group in terms of coordinate transformations
on superspace as a generalization of the denition of ordinary conformal transformations.
we then derive a superconformal killing equation, which is a necessary and sucient con-
dition for a supercoordinate transformation to be superconformal. the general solutions
are identied in terms of supertranslations, dilations, lorentz transformations, r-symmetry
transformations and special superconformal transformations, where r-symmetry is given by
u(n ) as in eq.(1.1) and supertranslations and special superconformal transformations are
dual to each other through superinversion map. the four-dimensional n -extended super-
conformal group is then identied with a supermatrix group, su(2, 2|n ), having dimensions
(15 +n 2|8n ) as known. however, we point out that for n = 4 case an equivalence relation
must be imposed on the supermatrix group and so the four-dimensional n = 4 supercon-
formal group is isomorphic to a quotient group of the supermatrix group.

in section 3, we obtain an explicit formula for the nite nonlinear superconformal trans-
formations of the supercoordinates, z, parameterizing superspace and discuss several repre-
sentations of the superconformal group. we also construct matrix or vector valued functions
depending on two or three points in superspace which transform covariantly under super-
conformal transformations. for two points, z1 and z2, we nd a matrix, i(z1, z2), which
transforms covariantly like a product of two tensors at z1 and z2. for three points, z1, z2, z3,
we nd tangent vectors, zi, which transform homogeneously at zi, i = 1, 2, 3. these are
crucial variables for obtaining two-point, three-point and general n-point correlation func-
tions later.

in section 4, we discuss the superconformal invariance of correlation functions for quasi-
primary superelds and exhibit general forms of two-point, three-point and n-point func-

2

tions. explicit formulae for two-point functions of superelds in various cases are given. in
general, due to the invariance under supertranslations and special superconformal trans-
formations, n-point functions reduce to one unspecied (n  2)-point function which must
transform homogeneously under the rigid transformations - dilations, lorentz transforma-
tions and r-symmetry transformations. we then identify all the superconformal invariants
and obtain the general form of n-point functions of scalar superelds. as a byproduct, we
derive the selection rule for correlation functions (1.2).

in section 5, superconformally covariant dierential operators are discussed. the condi-
tions for superelds, which are formed by the action of spinor derivatives on quasi-primary
superelds, to remain quasi-primary are obtained.
in general, the action of dierential
operator on quasi-primary elds generates an anomalous term under superconformal trans-
formations. however, with a suitable choice of scale dimension and r-symmetry charge,
we show that the anomalous term may be cancelled. we regard this analysis as a neces-
sary step to write superconformally invariant actions on superspace, as the kinetic terms
in such theories may consist of superelds formed by the action of spinor derivatives on
quasi-primary superelds.

in the appendix, the explicit form of superconformal algebra and a method of solving

the superconformal killing equation are exhibited.

recent review on the implications of n = 1 superconformal symmetry for four-dimensional

quantum eld theories is contained in [25] and some related works on superconformally in-
variant correlation functions can be found in [2633]. n = 1 superconformal symmetry on
curved superspace is studied in [3436] and conformally covariant dierential operators in
non-supersymmetric theories are discussed in [37, 38].

2 superconformal symmetry in four-dimensions

in this section we rst dene the four-dimensional n -extended superconformal group on
superspace and then discuss its superconformal killing equation along with the solutions.

2.1 four-dimensional superspace

the four-dimensional supersymmetry algebra has the standard1 form with p = (h, p)

{qa, qb

} = 2 b

a 

 p ,

[p, p] = [p, qa] = [p, qa

] = {qa, qb} = { qa

where 1  ,   2, 1  a  n and qa satises

qa = qa
 .

(2.1)

(2.2)

 generate a supergroup, gt , with parameters, zm = (x, a,  

p, qa and qa
a ), which
are coordinates on superspace. the general element of gt is written in terms of these
coordinates as

g(z) = ei(xp +aqa+ qa a) .
corresponding to eq.(2.2) we may assume a to satisfy

so that

a =  
a ,

g(z) = g(z)1 = g(z) .

(2.3)

(2.4)

(2.5)

the baker-campbell-haussdor formula with the supersymmetry algebra (2.1) gives

g(z1)g(z2) = g(z3) ,

2.2 superconformal group & killing equation

the superconformal group is dened here as a group of superspace coordinate transforma-
g z, that preserve the innitesimal supersymmetric interval length, e2 = ee
tions, z
up to a local scale factor, so that

e2(z)  e2(z) = 2(z; g)e2(z) ,

(2.18)

this requires b

 (z; g) = 2(z; g) ,

r(z; g)r(z; g) = r(z; g) .

innitesimally z  z + z, eq.(2.19) gives

dah = 2i(a) ,

da

h = 2i(a)  ,

where we dene

a = a ,

a =  a ,

h = x + ia a  ia a .

innitesimally r 

 from eq.(2.15) is of the form

r 

   

 + h ,

so that the condition (2.21) reduces to the ordinary conformal killing equation

2more explicit form of rm

n is obtained later in eq.(3.49).

h + h   .

6

(2.23)

(2.24)

(2.25)

(2.26)

(2.27)

eq.(2.27) follows from eq.(2.24). using the anti-commutator relation for da and db
we get from eq.(2.24)

 (2.11)

and hence

 b
a h = 1

a) (cid:17) ,

a (h + h) = (dab  db

a ) ,

(2.28)

(2.29)

which implies eq.(2.27). thus eq.(2.24) is a necessary and sucient condition for a super-
coordinate transformation to be superconformal.

with the notation as in eq.(a.15) we write

h  = h  ,

h  = h 
 ,

and using eq.(a.7), eq.(2.24) is equivalent to

da(h)  = 0 ,

or

dah  = 1

(2.30)

(2.31)

(2.32)

(2.33)

eq.(2.31) may therefore be regarded as the fundamental superconformal killing equation
and its solutions give the generators of extended superconformal transformations in four-
dimensions. the general solution is3

h(z) = xbx+  x( w  1

bb + 2aa + 4i(aa  aa) + a ,

where a, b,   r,   s1, t  su(n ) and for w = w we dene

w = 1

4w  ,

w = 1

4w .

for later use it is worth to note

(2.34)

(2.35)

 wt1 =  w ,

1wt = w ,

w = w .

(2.36)

3a method of obtaining the solution (2.34) is demonstrated in appendix b.

eq.(2.34) also gives

a = a + 1

2 ( + i)a  a w + ta

bb + abx+  iax+  4(ab) b ,

and

x+ = x+bx+  4x+aa + x+ + wx+  x+ w + 4iaa + a .

(2.37)

(2.38)

note that x+, a are functions of x+, a only, which can be also directly shown from
eq.(2.24).
in fact, the superconformal group can be obtained alternatively by imposing
the super-dieomorphisms to leave the chiral subspaces of superspace invariant. the chiral
structures are given by

in this approach, one needs to solve a reality condition [39, 40]

x+(x+, )  x(x, ) = 4ia(x, )a + 4iaa(x+, ) .

2.3 extended superconformal transformations

in summary, the generators of extended superconformal transformations in four-dimensions
acting on the four-dimensional superspace, r4|4n , with coordinates, zm = (x, a, a), can
be classied as

1. supertranslations, a, , 

x = a + ia a  ia a ,

a = a ,

 a = a .

(2.41)

this is consistent with eq.(2.7).

2. dilations, 

x = x ,

a = 1

2a ,

 a = 1

2a .

(2.42)

3. lorentz transformations, with w, w dened in eq.(2.35)

x = w

x ,

a = a w ,

 a = w a .

(2.43)

4. r-symmetry transformations, u(n ), of dimension n 2, t, 

x = 0 ,

a = ta

 a = btb

a = abx+  iax+  4(ab)b ,

(2.45)

 a = xba + ixa  4b(b a) .

2.4 superinversion

in four-dimensions we dene superinversion, zm is zm = (x, a,  

a )  r4|4n , by

it is easy to verify that superinversion is idempotent

we get under superinversion

e(z) = x1

e(z) = x1

from eq.(2.62) we can read o the explicit forms of four-dimensional superconformal alge-
bra as exhibited in appendix c.

now, we consider n 6= 4 case and n = 4 case separately. for n 6= 4 case, if we

dene a (4 + n )  (4 + n ) supermatrix, m, as

then the relation above (2.62) agrees with the matrix commutator

[m1, m2] = m3 .

this can be veried using eqs.(a.7, a.11, a.12).
in general, for n 6= 4, m can be dened as a (4, n ) supermatrix subject to

and a reality condition

str m = 0 ,

bmb1 = m ,

b =

corresponds to a generator of o(2, 4) = su(2, 2) as demonstrated in appendix d. thus,
the n 6= 4 superconformal group in four-dimensions may be identied with the supermatrix
group generated by supermatrices of the form m (2.63), which is su(2, 2|n )  gs having
dimensions (15 + n 2|8n ).

12

when n = 4, similar analysis is also possible with a subtle modication. in this case,

m is a (4, 4) supermatrix satisfying the reality condition (2.67) and, instead of eq.(2.66),

such a supermatrix, m, is of the general form

str m = 2i .

where m is of the form (2.63) with  = 0, and  in eq.(2.70) is just an arbitrary real
bosonic variable. essentially we add the  term to eq.(2.63) to get eq.(2.70). same as
n 6= 4 case, the matrix commutator of m1 and m2 reproduces eq.(2.62) as in eq.(2.65),
though  is arbitrary.
as the variable, , is auxiliary, one might be tempted to x its value, or more generally
let it be a function of the parameters of superconformal transformations, a, b, ,    and
try to determine the function. however, this is not possible. the commutator of m1 and
m2 includes  type term

[m1, m2] = m3 + i 1

2 3 1 ,

(2.71)

3 = 2i(a

21a  a

12a + a

2 1a  a

1 2a) ,

and 3 can not be expressed in terms of the parameters, a
3 , 3,   , appearing in
eq.(2.62). hence it is not possible to put  as a function of the superconformal transforma-
tion parameters.4 therefore four-dimensional n = 4 superconformal algebra is represented
by (4, 4) supermatrices, m, satisfying the reality condition (2.67) with an equivalence rela-
tion, , imposed

if m1  m2 = i 1

for some   r .

(2.72)

we note that an extra condition, strm = 0, denes an invariant subalgebra of the whole
four-dimensional n = 4 superconformal algebra. this invariant subalgebra forms a simple
lie superalgebra. in the literature the four-dimensional n = 4 superconformal algebra is
often identied with this simple lie superalgebra, the r-symmetry of which is su(4) rather
than u(4) [18], as the  term in eq.(2.70) is neglected. however, we emphasize here that
the whole n = 4 superconformal algebra may contain a u(1) factor which has non-trivial

4an alternative approach may be taken as in [41], where a modied supermatrix commutator is intro-

duced for sl(m|m).

commutator relations with other generators as seen in eq.(2.62) or eq.(c.9).

the n = 4 superconformal group in four-dimensions, gs, is now identied with a
quotient group of the supermatrix group, as it is isomorphic to the supermatrix group
generated by supermatrices of the form m (2.70) with an equivalence relation imposed on
the supermatrix group element, g, from eq.(2.72)

g1  g2

if g1

1 g2 = ei 1 for some   r .

(2.73)

we also note that the four-dimensional n = 4 superconformal group has dimensions (31|32)
and is isomorphic to a semi-direct product of u(1) and a simple lie supergroup. therefore,
by breaking the u(1) symmetry, the four-dimensional n = 4 superconformal group can be
reduced to the simple lie subgroup having dimensions (30|32).

3 coset realization of transformations

in this section, we rst obtain an explicit formula for the nite nonlinear superconformal
transformations of the supercoordinates and discuss several representations of the super-
conformal group. we then construct matrix (vector) valued functions depending on two
(three) points in superspace which transform covariantly under superconformal transforma-
tions. these are crucial variables for obtaining two-point, three-point and general n-point
correlation functions later.

3.1 superspace as a coset

to obtain an explicit formula for the nite nonlinear superconformal transformations, we
rst identify the superspace, r4|4n , as a coset, gs/g0, where g0  gs is the subgroup
generated by matrices, m0, of the form (2.63) with a = 0, a = 0 and depending on
parameters b, a, a, , , w, ta
b. the group of supertranslations, gt , parameterized
by coordinates, zm  r4|4n , has been dened by general elements as in eq.(2.3), with the
group property given by eqs.(2.6, 2.7). now we may represent it by supermatrices5

gt (z) = exp

(3.1)

note that gt (z)1 = gt (z).

in general an element of gs can be uniquely decomposed as gt g0. thus for any element

5the subscript, t , denotes supertranslations.

14

g(g)  gs we may dene a superconformal transformation, z
element g0(z; g)  g0 by

g z, and an associated

g(g)1gt (z)g0(z; g) = gt (z) .

if g(g)  gt then clearly g0(z; g) = 1.

innitesimally eq.(3.2) becomes

gt (z) = mgt (z)  gt (z) m0(z) ,

(3.2)

(3.3)

where m is given by eq.(2.63) or eq.(2.70) and m0(z), the generator of g0, has the form

w(z), w(z) can be also written as w(z) = 1

4 w(z), w(z) = 1
w(z) = w + 4x[b] + a[](2a  iba)  (2a + iab)[]

3.2 finite transformations

(3.18)

(3.19)

finite superconformal transformations can be obtained by exponentiation of innitesimal

transformations. to obtain a superconformal transformation, z
the dierential equation

d

zm
t = lm (zt) ,

z0 = z ,

z1 = z ,

where, with l given in eq.(2.59), lm (z) is dened by

l = lm (z)m .

17

(3.22)

(3.23)

from eq.(3.14) we get

which integrates to

where k(z, t) satises

d

z(zt) = mz(zt)  z(zt)h(zt) ,

z(zt) = etm z(z)k(z, t) ,

k(z, 0) =  1 0

(3.24)

(3.25)

(3.26)

hence for t = 1 with k(z, 1)  k(z; g) the superconformal transformation, z
eq.(3.25) becomes

g z, from

z(z) = g(g)1z(z)k(z; g) ,

g(g)1 = em .

g0(z; g) in eq.(3.2) is related to k(z; g) from eq.(3.27) by

g0(z; g)z0 = z0k(z; g) .

in general k(z; g) is of the form

k(z; g) =  l(z+; g) 2b(z; g)

l(z+; g) is dened on chiral superspace, and since l(z+; g) is a 2  2 matrix, we have

l(z+; g)l(z+; g)t = det l(z+; g)  .

(3.31)

innitesimally this is consistent with eq.(2.36).
we decompose l(z+; g) as

l(z+; g) = +(z+; g) 1

2 l(z+; g) ,

+(z+; g) = det l(z+; g) ,

2 l(z; g) = l(z+; g)  sl(2, c) ,

(z; g) = det l(z; g) = +(z+; g) .

note that

since

(z; g) q+(z+; g)(z; g) .

(z; g) = (z; g) ,

(z; g) = (z; g)1 .

when n = 4, (z; g) is related to the superdeterminant of g(g)  gs

then r 

 (z; g) is identical to the denition (2.20), since innitesimally

(z)  w(z) +  w(z) = (z)   w 

 (z) = h(z) ,

which agrees with eq.(2.26). furthermore eq.(3.46) shows that the denition (2.21) of
(z; g) is consistent with eq.(3.42). we may normalize r 

r 

 (z; g) = (z; g)1r 

 (z; g) as well
 (z; g)  so(1, 3) = sl(2, c)/z2 .

3.3 representations

+(z+; g) = (z; g)(z; g)

n

n 4 ,

(z; g) = (z; g)(z; g) n

n 4 .

(3.52)

hence, they also form representations of the n 6= 4 superconformal group. on the other
hand, in the case of n = 4, due to the arbitrariness of  in eq.(2.70) l(z+; g) and l(z; g)
do not form representations. they do so only if the equivalence relation (2.73) is imposed,
but this will give just l(z+; g) , l(z; g) and (z; g).

3.4 functions of two points

in this subsection, we construct matrix valued functions depending on two points, z1 and
z2, in superspace which transform covariantly like a product of two tensors at z1 and z2
under superconformal transformations.

not independent [24, 25].

4 superconformal invariance of correlation functions

in this section we discuss the superconformal invariance of correlation functions for quasi-
primary superelds and exhibit general forms of two-point, three-point and n-point func-
tions.

4.1 quasi-primary superelds

we rst assume6 that there exist quasi-primary superelds, i(z), which under the super-
conformal transformation, z

g z, transform as

i  i ,

i(z) = j (z)d i

j (z; g) .

(4.1)

6in [24] it was explicitly shown that the chiral/anti-chiral superelds and supercurrents in some n = 1

theories are quasi-primary.

27

d(z; g) obeys the group property so that under the successive superconformal transforma-
tions, g : z

g
 z, it satises

g z

and hence also

d(z; g)d(z; g) = d(z; g) ,

d(z; g)1 = d(z; g1) .

(4.2)

(4.3)

we choose here d(z; g) to be a representation of sl(2, c)  su(n )  u(1)  d, which is
a subgroup of the stability group at z = 0, and so we decompose the spin index, i, of
superelds into sl(2, c) index, , and su(n ) index, r, as i  
j (z; g) is
factorized as

r. now d i

d i

j (z; g) = d 

 ( l(z+; g))dr

s(u(z; g))(z; g)(z; g) ,

(4.4)

 ( l), dr

where d 
are the scale dimension and r-symmetry charge of 
innitesimally

r respectively.

s(u) are representations of sl(2, c), su(n ) respectively, while  and 



r(z) = (l + (z) + i (z))

r(z)  

r(z) 1

where s, sa

b are matrix generators of so(1, 3), su(n ) satisfying

n (zn)i = hi1

1 (z1)i2

2 (z2)    in

n (zn)i .

(4.11)

in superconformal eld theories on chiral superspace, the representation of u(1)  d is

given by

+(z+; g) ,

so that for n 6= 4,  and  are related by, from eq.(3.52),

 + ( 4
n

 1) = 0 .

(4.12)

(4.13)

on the other hand when n = 4, as shown in subsection 3.3, +(z+; g) does not form a
representation of the n = 4 superconformal group, and hence there is no conventional
way of dening quasi-primary chiral/anti-chiral superelds in n = 4 superconformal the-
ories. we speculate that this fact makes it dicult to construct four-dimensional n = 4
superconformal theories on chiral superspace.

and i (x12), i r
s(v(z12)) are tensors transforming covariantly according to the appropriate
representations of sl(2, c), su(n ) which are formed by decomposition of tensor products
of x12, v(z12).

7see subsection 4.4 for a proof.

29

under superconformal transformations, i (x12) and i r

s(v(z12)) satisfy from eqs.(3.65a, 3.70)

d(l(z1; g))i(x12)d( l(z2+; g)) = i(x12) ,

d(u(z1; g)1)i(v(z12))d(u(z2; g)) = i(v(z12)) .

as examples, we rst consider the chiral/anti-chiral scalar and spinorial elds,

s(z+), s(z), (z+),  (z) in n 6= 4 theories which transform as

s(z+) = +(z+; g)s(z+) ,

s(z

) = (z; g) s(z) ,

(z+) = +(z+; g)(z+) l 

 (z+; g) ,

so that from eq.(4.13)  + ( 4

the two-point functions of them are

 (z

) = (z; g) l

(z; g)  (z) ,

note that i(z12)  r(z12; is), where r(z; is) is given by eq.(2.53).

a(z) = (z; g)(z; g)b(z)ub

a(z; g) ,

a(z) = (z; g)(z; g)u1a

note that to have non-vanishing two-point correlation functions, the scale dimensions, ,
of the two elds must be equal and the r-symmetry charges must have the same absolute
value with opposite signs, , , as shown in subsection 4.4 later.

for a real vector supereld, v (z), if we dene

note that l  sl(2, c), u  su(n ),   r,   s1 and r

( l) is given from eq.(3.46) by

r

( l) = 1

2tr( l l) .

(4.34)

in general there are a nite number of linearly independent solutions of eq.(4.33a), and
this number may be reduced by imposing extra restrictions on the correlation function.

8see subsection 4.4 for a proof.

32

as an example, we consider the three-point correlation function of a real vector supereld,
v (z), where  = 0. from eq.(4.32) we may write

hv (z1)v (z2)v (z3)i =

h  

(z1)i  (z12)i (z13)
12x2
(x2

21x2

31x2

1
2 

13)

.

(4.35)

since eq.(4.33a) is obtained by considering invariance under continuous superconformal
transformations, invariance under superinversion which is a discrete map may give an extra
restriction. besides the superconformal invariance, the three-point function has additional
symmetry under permutations of the superelds. furthermore, for supercurrents we may
require the correlation function to satisfy the conservation equations like eqs.(4.30 ,4.31).
more explicitly, under superinversion we may require v (z) transforms to

v (z) = v (z) r

(z; is)(z; is) .

(4.36)

the occurrence of the minus sign in n = 1 wess-zumino model and vector supereld
is zj, j = 1, 2, 3, implies
theory was veried in [24]. invariance under superinversion, zj
using eqs.(2.52, 3.72, 3.74)

h  

(z1) r

(z1; is) r 

(z1; is) r

(z1; is) = (z1; is)h (z1) ,

(4.37)

which also implies using eqs.(3.92, 3.95a)
(z12; is) r 

(z12; is)h  

(z1) r

(z12; is) r

(z12; is) = h ((z2)) ,

(4.38)

where (z2) is given by superinversion, z2
from hv (z1)v (z2)v (z3)i = hv (z1)v (z3)v (z2)i we have

is (z2).

h (z) = h (z) ,

(4.39)

and from hv (z1)v (z2)v (z3)i = hv (z2)v (z3)v (z1)i we have using eqs.(3.90, 4.38) with
z

is (z)

h ((z)) = (z; is)h (z) r

(z; is) .

(4.40)

imposing these extra conditions it was shown that the three-point correlation functions of
supercurrents in n = 1 theories have two linearly independent forms [25]. similarly, the
three-point functions of real scalar superelds in n = 1 theories have also two linearly
independent solutions [24].

invariance under r-symmetry transformations (4.33b,d) implies that h (z) is a func-
a or equivalently x , a a, as demonstrated in subsection 4.5, and

tion of x , a  
hence we may put

h (z) = h (x , a a) .

(4.41)

4.4 n-point correlation functions - in general

primary superelds,

,

where in a similar fashion to eq.(3.75) z1(1),    , z1(n2) are given, with zk1
by

is gzk1, k  2,

(4.43)

j = 2, 3,    , n  1 .

gt (gzn1)1gt (fzj1) = gt (z1(j1)) ,

we note that all of them are tangent vectors at z1.
superconformal invariance (4.11) is equivalent to

thus, in general n-point functions reduce to one unspecied (n  2)-point function which
must transform homogeneously under the rigid transformations,

sl(2, c)  su(n )  u(1)  d.

gu z, dened by

gt (z) = gt (z1 )gt (zs(z; u)) ,

gt (z) = gt (z1)1gt (z) ,

(4.46)

(4.47)

where zs(z; u) is a special superconformal transformation given in eq.(2.58) and z1 can be
arbitrary. since

gt (gzk1) = gt (u)gt (gzk1)

l(z1+; gu) = l(z1; gu) = 1 ,

for k  2 ,

(z1; gu) = (z1; gu) = 1 ,

h1

r12r2nrn(gz21,gz31,    ,gzn1) possesses a supertranslational invariance

h1

9the key idea in this proof rst appeared in [24].

r12r2nrn(gz21,gz31,    ,gzn1) = h1

r12r2nrn(gz21,gz31,    ,gzn1) .

(4.48)

(4.49)

thus we can write

h1

r12r2nrn(gz21,gz31,    ,gzn1) = h 1

r12r2nrn(z1(1),    , z1(n2)) ,

with the transformation rule for z1 (3.85), eq.(4.50) completes our proof.

gt (z1(j1)) = gt (gzn1)1gt (fzj1) .

q.e.d.

we note that, in the case of n = 2, h 1

r12r2 is independent of z1, z2 and eqs.(4.44c,d)
show that two-point functions vanish if 1 6= 2 or 1 6= 2. furthermore, if the represen-
tation is irreducible then h = 1 by schurs lemma.

4.5 selection rule & superconformal invariants

we begin with elds, i(x), depending on x  r4 which are obtained by letting the grass-
mann coordinates inside quasi-primary superelds, i(x, a, a), be zero

i(x)  i(x, 0, 0) .

(4.51)

they are the lowest order term appearing in the power series expansions of superelds in
grassmann coordinates. the superconformal invariance under u(1) transformations (4.44d)
implies for arbitrary   s1

hi1

1 (x1)    in

n (xn)i = ei(1++n)hi1

1 (x1)    in

n (xn)i ,

(4.52)

hence, if the the sum of the r-symmetry charge, i, is not zero then the correlation function
must vanish as exhibited in eq.(1.2)

hi1

1 (x1)    in

n (xn)i = 0

if

nxi=1

i 6= 0 .

(4.53)

this selection rule can be generalized further to all the other component elds in the power
series expansions of superelds

i(x, a, a) = i(x) + i

a(x)a +  

a

ia

 (x) +    .

(4.54)

if we dene the r-symmetry charge of the component elds, i(x), i
,  + 1

2, etc. respectively, then the invariance under u(1) transformation,

2,   1

a(x), ia

 (x), etc. as

hi1

1 (x1, a

1, 1a)    i = ei(1++n)hi1

1 (x1, ei 1

2 a

1, ei 1

2  1a)    i ,

(4.55)

36

implies that the selection rule (4.53) holds for all the component elds.

the existence of this kind of selection rule in n = 4 super yang-mills theory was pre-
viously predicted by intriligator within the context of ads/cft correspondence, as the
dual iib supergravity contains a corresponding u(1) symmetry [1]. therefore our results
provide a supporting evidence for the maldacena conjecture, as the selection rule here is
derived by purely considering the symmetry on cft side without referring to the string
side.

essentially, for n 6= 4 case, the selection rule exists since the four-dimensional n 6= 4
superconformal group includes the u(1) factor inevitably. however in n = 4 case, as
veried in subsection 2.5, the corresponding superconformal group is isomorphic to a semi-
direct product of u(1) and a simple lie supergroup so that it can be reduced to the simple
lie subgroup by breaking the u(1) symmetry. in this case, the selection rule will not be
applicable to the corresponding n = 4 superconformal theory, since the u(1) representa-
tion becomes trivial, (z; g) = 1, and the r-symmetry charge is not dened.

now, we consider correlation functions of quasi-primary scalar superelds, (z). from
eqs.(4.44a,b) h(z1(1),    , z1(n2)) must be sl(2, c)su(n ) invariant and hence it is a func-
tion of sl(2, c)  su(n ) invariants. according to [42], these invariants can be obtained by
contracting in all possible ways the spinorial indices of

(4.57)

on the other hand if we write

1(j), 1(j)a) are normalized zm

1(i) = ( x

(4.58)
then using eq.(a.20a) one can show that x1(i)x1(j) are all the invariants for sl(2, c) 
su(n )  u(1)  d and hence invariants for the whole n -extended superconformal group.
note that from eq.(3.93b), some of them are pseudo invariants under superinversion.

equations, i = ci; 1  i  d. thus the number of independent superconformal invariants
or x1(i)x1(j) in four-dimensions, #n, is

for n = 3 ,

4n2  12n + 1

for n  4 .

(4.63)

this result holds for n  2, and for n = 1 due to the identity (a.19a) the number of

invariant. hence it is a function of x1(i)x1(j) and the n-point correlation function of scalar
superelds reduces to an arbitrary #n variable function. the n-point function in this case
may have the following general form

we note that this result holds in arbitrary dimension, d.

as an example, we consider scalar elds, (x). the n-point function of them is from

contracting  and  indices gives

and hence

dbdah  = 0 ,

h(z) = a(, ) + (, )x + w

(, )x + 2xb(, )x  x2b(, ) ,

where w(, ) + w(, ) = 0.
then eq.(b.4) can be written in terms of h = h as

where

w (, ) =  1

a(, ) = a(, )  i 1

2w(, )(aa[] + [] aa) + 4ab(, )b ab = a(, ) .

(b.6)
essentially we may regard w (, ) as an arbitrary 2  2 matrix and a(, ) as an arbitrary
2  2 hermitian matrix.

which ensure that substituting eq.(b.5) into eq.(2.32) leads independent equations for
b(, ), w (, ), a(, ).

after substituting eq.(b.5) into eq.(2.32), we get from the x2-terms

b(, ) = 0. therefore

in a similar fashion, or taking complex conjugate, one can show da
b(, ) is independent of ,  and eq.(b.7) shows that xbx+ is a solution of eq.(2.32).

the remaining terms lead
(da w (, )x)  + (xdaw (, ))  + 4i(da w (, )b) b + da a (, )

thus we get

therefore we get the solution for w

however, h(z) is independent of c and hence we can put c = 0.

since dadb a(, ) = 0 we can put

where   r and t  su(n ) i.e. t = t, tr t = 0.
eq.(b.30a) gives the general solution for a(, )

all together, we get the general solution of the superconformal killing equation (2.34).

d realization of o(2, 4) = su(2, 2) structure in m

[ab, cd] = gacbd + gadbc + gbcad  gbdac .

eq.(2.67), the condition on m, is satised partially by eq.(d.4).

in general, m can be dened as a 44 matrix subject to trm = 0 and a reality condition

bm + mb = 0 ,

b =  0 1

then tr m = 0 and eq.(d.8) is equivalent to

hence m  su(2, 2).
