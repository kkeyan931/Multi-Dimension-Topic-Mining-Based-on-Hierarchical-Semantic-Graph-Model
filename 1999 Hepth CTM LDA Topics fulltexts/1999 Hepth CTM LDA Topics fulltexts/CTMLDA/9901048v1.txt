abstract

we study the large n operator spectrum of the (1,0) superconformal chi-

ral six-dimensional theory with e8 global symmetry. this spectrum is dual

to the kaluza-klein spectrum of supergravity on ads7  s4/z2 with a ten-
dimensional e8 theory at its singular locus. we identify those operators in

short multiplets of osp (6, 2| 2), whose dimensions are exact for any n. we
also discuss more general issues concerning ads/cft duality on orbifold su-

pergravity backgrounds.

i. introduction

in the last year important new methods for studying superconformal theories have been
developed based on a conjecture by maldacena [1]. this conjecture relates d-dimensional
superconformal theories to string theory/m-theory to adsd+1  m, where m is a com-
pact manifold. using a prescription given by gubser, klebanov and polyakov [2] and wit-
ten [3] one can associate operators on the d-dimensional boundary with elds in the bulk
of ads(d+1) and compute correlation functions for these operators using supergravity.

in the spirit of much of the modern work in string duality, our goal in this paper is
not the presentation of further evidence for the ads/cft correspondence, but rather to
use this correspondence to determine the unknown spectrum of operators for interacting
superconformal theories. of particular interest for us is the six-dimensional (1,0) xed point
theory with e8 global symmetry [4,5]. one feature which makes this theory particularly
interesting is that it has both a coulomb branch along which states charged under e8
decouple, and a higgs branch with broken e8 global symmetry. the transition from one
branch to the other can be used to connect four-dimensional theories with dierent numbers
of chiral elds [6]. unfortunately this otherwise useful eld theory has no known lagrangian
description (see [7]). there does exist a discrete light-cone quantized description for the
(1, 0) theory [810], but this does not include the operator spectrum. in order to obtain
better control over the properties of the (1, 0) superconformal xed point we use ads/cft
duality to extract its spectrum of chiral operators.

to derive the spectrum of chiral operators, we determine the spectrum of kaluza-klein
modes for the m-theory background in the large n limit where supergravity is valid 1. the
kk modes couple to gauge invariant operators on the ads boundary with dimensions
which are either protected or receive 1/n corrections, and provide a description of the
chiral operator spectrum of the (1, 0) theory which remains useful for small n. other six-
dimensional (1, 0) theories (with dierent global symmetries) have been studied in [11,12]).
finding the supergravity background appropriate for describing the (1, 0) theory involves
orbifolding the dual background for the interacting large n (2, 0) six-dimensional theory
(studied in the ads/cft context by [1316]) . the orbifold process brings interesting new
aspects to the ads/cft story (see for example [17,18]). in our analysis we bring out new
features such as the appearance of multiple types of short superconformal multiplets, generic
to all orbifolds which break the cft r-symmetry.

the paper is organized as follows.

in section ii, we describe the singular m-theory
geometry conjectured in [19] which yields the ads dual to the (1, 0) theory. fields in this
geometry as well as the operators of the (1, 0) theory fall into representations of osp (6, 2| 2).
in section iii we build short multiplets of interest for this supergroup using the oscillator
construction of [21]. section iv matches e8 neutral operators of the (1, 0) theory with kk
reduced elds from the bulk m-theory geometry, while section v matches operators charged
under e8 with the kk reduction of elds living at the singular locus of this geometry.
finally in section 5 we summarize by listing relevant and marginal operators of the (1, 0)

1we label by n the (1, 0) theory which can be resolved to n/2 free tensor theories in its coulomb
branch

theory, and comment on their physical relevance. we also discuss at some length some
general features of orbifold constructions.

ii. compactification geometry

the (1, 0) theory we are interested in can be thought of as placing a large number, n, of
m5-branes on top of an end-of-the-world 9-branes of the horava-witten compactication
of m-theory [20], r1,9  s1/z2. the near horizon geometry of n m5-branes is ads7  s4,
where the s4 is described by the equation

(x 6)2 + (x 7)2 + (x 8)2 + (x 9)2 + (x 11)2 = r2.

(2.1)

r is a xed radius whose size grows with n.

since the z2 mentioned above ips the sign of x 11, it is natural to believe that large n
(1, 0) theory is dual to m-theory on ads7  s4/z2 as conjectured in [19]. the z2 action has
a xed point locus, ads7  s3, on which propagates the d = 10 n = 1 sym e8 multiplet
derived in the horava-witten compactication. this e8 twisted sector was present in the m-
theory background before we took the near-horizon limit. it can also be directly motivated,
as the gravitational anomaly argument [20] which dictates its presence at z2 singularities
in at space still applies in our curved background.

upon reduction of m-theory down to the ads7, there are two kinds of kk modes. the
kk modes of the rst kind are given in terms of the kk modes of m-theory on s4 which
survive the z2 projection. these modes carry no e8 quantum numbers and hence couple
only to e8-neutral operators on the boundary of ads7. the kk-modes from the xed s3
have adjoint e8 quantum numbers and couple to charged operators on the ads7 boundary,
in a manner similar to the one described in [18]. note that since only adjoint e8 elds exist
in the bulk, any operator on the boundary in a representation of e8 other than the adjoint
will have to couple to a multi-particle state 2.

two more points need to be made about the modes on this m-theory background. first,
the isometry group, so(5), of the original s4 is broken to so(4) = su(2)r  su(2)l by
the z2 projection. the gauge group for ads7 is then su(2)r  su(2)l  e8, but we pick a
basis such that only the rst factor is embedded in the superconformal algebra osp (6, 2| 2).
second, the twisted sector e8 elds will not shift the large n mass spectrum of the kk
bulk modes since they only aect tree-level computations when they are given a non-zero
vev. for large n the size of the s4 grows much faster than that of the xed point s3,
therefore masses for bulk kaluza-klein modes unprotected by supersymmetry will receive
at most 1/n corrections from interactions with the twisted sector elds.

iii. oscillator construction of osp (6, 2| 2) short multiplets
before going on to calculate the mass spectrum of the low-energy kaluza-klein m-theory
modes on the geometry described above, we would like to rst take a moment to construct

2see [22] for more on the role of multi-particle states.

3

the short multiplets of osp (6, 2| 2) which will be relevant to our problem. we do this
because any kk modes which we can t into one of these short multiplets will have mass
eigenvalues xed by the osp (6, 2| 2) group theory, making explicit calculations unnecessary.
we follow the methods of gunaydin etal. [21] used for constructing multiplets of osp(6, 2|4)
with just a slight modication to allow for the reduced r-symmetry. since this method is
extensively described in [21], we will only give a brief review.

the basic idea is to start with the maximal compact proper subgroup of the bosonic
part of the osp (6, 2| 2) superalgebra, so(6, 2) su(2)r. this subgroup is u(4)b  u(1)f .
we next introduce p pairs of bosonic creation/annihilation operators ai(r) = (ai(r)) and
bi(r) = (bi(r)) transforming in the 4 and 4 representation of u(4)b (with r = 1, . . . , p), as
well as a pair of fermionic creation/annihilation operators (r), (r) and (r), (r) with
u(1)f charges + 1
2 and  1
2 respectively. we organize these oscillators into column vectors:
a(r) =   ai(r)
(r) !
a(r) =   bi(r)
(r) ! ,
(r) ! , ( r = 1, . . . , p,
(r)! , a(r) =   bi(r)
a(r) =   ai(r)

i, j, . . . = 1, . . . , 4

.

(3.1)

(a =  will represent the one fermionic index) whose only non-zero commutation/anti-
commutation relations can be represented symbolically as

na(r), b(s)i =  b
a r
s

na(r), b(s)i =  b
a r
s.

(3.2)

the lie superalgebra can now be realized in terms of bilinears in  and . they are

given by

aab = a  b  a  b,
aab = a

ab = b  a  b  a,

m a

b = a  b + (1)deg(a)deg(b)b  a,

(3.3)

where deg(a) = 0 for a bosonic index a and deg(a) = 1 for a fermionic index a.
the even subalgebra so(6, 2)  su(2)r is generated by the elements {aij, aij, m i
j} and
{a, a, m}.
this oscillator construction of generators naturally implements a jordan decomposition
of osp (6, 2| 2) with respect to the maximal compact subgroup u(4|1) graded with the u(1)
generator, q = 1

2m a
a:

l = l  l0  l+.

(3.4)

the generators aab and aab correspond to the l and l+ spaces, respectively. the
generators m a
b of u(4|1) give the l0 space. we use this jordan decomposition to generate
unitary irreducible representations (uirs) of osp (6, 2| 2) . we start with a lowest weight
state, | i, in an irreducible representation of l0 and annihilated by all the generators in
l. the complete uir is then generated using successive applications of generators in l+
on | i.

4

to understand the physical interpretation of states in a given uir, it is convenient to
further decompose representations of u(4|1) into representations of u(4)b  u(1)f . we
label the u(4|1) representations in terms of super-young tableaux 3. their decompositions
look like:

  
  

 (

, 1), (

,

), (1,

).

(3.5)

the group u(4)b  spin(6)  u(1)b is the maximal compact subgroup of so(6, 2).
u(1)b is generated by the charge qb = 1
in the ads/cft duality,
this charge corresponds to the ads energy of a supergravity mode and to the dimension of
its dual cft operator. nb is the bosonic number operator, and for a u(4) representation
is just the number of boxes in the corresponding young tableau. for that given young
tableau, the spin(6) representation can be recovered by matching the su(4) indices with
the appropriate su(4)-invariant tensor. a few examples4 are:

2(nb + 4p).

2m i

i = 1

| 0 i ,
scalar

|
i ,
spinor

|

i ,

a

i ,
|
vector

(3.6)

finally, u(1)f is generated by qf = 1

now that we have a better understanding of how to interpret states in representations
of u(4|1), let us quickly describe the action of the l+ generators. in order to do this, we
break up the set l+ into the subsets:

2 m = 1

2(nf  p), which measures su(2)r spin.

l+ = naabo  


b+ = {aij}
q+ = {ai}
f + = {a}

.

(3.7)

given a representation of u(4)b  u(1)f , b+ gives conformal descendants. in ads these
correspond to higher energy fourier-like modes. f + generates the complete set of spin states
in a given su(2)r representation. finally, q+ is the set of supersymmetry generators.

to illustrate how the oscillator construction works, we start with the simplest example

| i = | 0ip,

(3.8)

the vacuum corresponding to p pairs of oscillators. this state is a scalar with dimen-
sion/energy equal to 2p and lowest su(2)r spin  p
2 . with its f + descendants, | i lls
out the (p+1) of su(2)r. acting with q gives the following supermultiplet of conformal
primary states (lowest energy states):

3these super-young tableaux are presented in detail within section 5 of [21].

4more details can be found at the end of section 2 of [21]

(3.9)

for p < 4 we keep only those states with positive su(2)r dimension. for readabilitys sake
we always include the spin(6) representation labeled in terms of elds in ads7.

the highest spacetime spin in the multiplet (3.9) is the vector, indicating a short repre-
sentation of the superalgebra. in fact, if we act with q on the superconformal primary, the
topmost scalar, its highest weight su(2)r component is annihilated. this means that we
are dealing with a level one short multiplet in the formalism discussed by [23]. the super-
conformal primary state in this type of short multiplet (the topmost scalar) has dimension
 = 4s where s is the su(2)r spin. we can check this explicitly:

 = qb| 0ip = 2p = 4 qf| 0ip = 4s.

(3.10)

in order to dierentiate from other short multiplets, we call this type of multiplet a chiral
multiplet. it will play an important role in our analysis.

there is another short multiplet of osp (6, 2| 2) that we will nd useful, starting with

the ground state

[ab] | 0ip.

(3.11)

this ground state, with super-young tableau given in (eq. 3.5), gives a vector of dimension
(2p + 1), a spinor of dimension (2p + 1
2) and a scalar of dimension 2p. since the scalar has
lowest dimension, we will refer to it as the superconformal primary. the states in this
multiplet are:

again, we only allow states with positive su(2)r dimension. even then, for p < 5 some of
the elements listed above are not in fact conformal primaries, but f + and b+ descendants of
other primaries. for example, when p = 2 the vector in the 1 of su(2)r is the f + descendant
of the vector in the 3. this odd behavior is related to the fact that this multiplet does not
develop null states until level 3. the superconformal primary (scalar) for this short multiplet
has  = 4s + 4. we know from [23] that short multiplets of osp (6, 2| 2) can have scalar
superconformal primaries with

 = 4s, 4s + 2, 4s + 4, 4s + 6,

(3.13)

but only the ones described in this chapter will be relevant for the supergravity spectrum.

iv. kaluza-klein reduction of the bulk eleven-dimensional

supergravity

now that we have established some of the multiplet structure of osp (6, 2| 2) we can
carry out our analysis of the bulk s4 kaluza-klein modes which survive the z2 projection.
the group theory for this process is simple. these kk modes come from s4 harmonics in
representations of so(5). decomposing so(5)  su(2)r  su(2)l  z2 , with z2 = +/
for harmonics which are even/odd under x 11  x 11, we reduce all the 11-dimensional
supergravity elds on the even harmonics except for the 3-form 5. this last eld is reduced
on odd harmonics since it ips sign under parity reversal. for convenience, we will describe

5here we refer to forms in index free notation

7

the kk spectrum in terms of the dual cft operators and apply the z2 projection on the
cft spectrum.

the s4 kk spectrum derived in ref. [24,25] can be nicely organized in terms of dual
operators using place-holder elds [26]. in [15] the short multiplet operator spectrum for
the (2, 0) theory dual to ads7  s4 was written in terms of place-holder scalar, spinor and
tensor elds

, , h

(4.1)

taken to be in the adjoint of u(n). they transform in the 5, 4, and 1 representation of
so(5) 6. starting with a superconformal primary operator

o 0, 0, p = t r p

(4.2)

(the power p is schematic, the s are actually in symmetric traceless representation of
so(5)) we build a complete supermultiplet of conformal primary operators

o m, n, k = t r h m n k, m + n + k = p.

(4.3)

note that in the oscillator method used to generate superconformal multiplets of
osp (6,2| 4), these multiplets are built using the vacuum ground state with the same number
p of oscillator avors (see [21]). the p=1 operators tr h, tr , and tr  are the only op-
erators in the abelian part of u(n) and correspond to the doubleton. they decouple from
the theory. the p = 2 supermultiplet (also referred to as the massless multiplet) is very
important, as it contains the r-symmetry currents, the super-currents and the stress-energy
tensor, as well as relevant scalar operators.

to look at the operators dual to the kk modes of s4/z2 we use a simple extension of
the methods above. we split the place-holder elds into an even group and an odd group.
the even group contains scalars and spinors




in the (2, 2),
in the (1, 2),

(4.4)

where su(2)r  su(2)l is now the global symmetry. these place-holders transform in the
anti-symmetric (as) of usp(n) (n must be even) and loosely correspond to uctuations
inside the end-of-the-world 9-brane. since we have broken u(n) to usp(n), traces of
place-holder elds include the symplectic matrix j. this means any number of these even
place-holder elds can appear in a trace (t r[ j  as] 6= 0).

the odd group contains a scalar, spinors, and a self-dual 2-form

in the (1, 1),
in the (2, 1), and



h in the (1, 1).

(4.5)

6we denote with a  elds in so(5) r-symmetry representations

8

these place-holders transform in the adjoint of usp(n), so only operators represented by
traces with an even number of these survive the z2 projection due to the commutation
relation of adjoint usp(n) matrices with j. for a given p, the superconformal primaries
o 0, 0, p of the n = 2 algebra break up into separate superconformal primaries of the n = 1
algebra. the ones which survive the z2 projection can be schematically written as

t r p, t r p22, t r p44, . . .

(4.6)

the rst of these primaries will transform in the (p+1,p+1) of su(2)r  su(2)l the next
in the (p1,p1), and so on. they all inherit the dimension of o 0, 0, p, so will have  = 2p.
relating their r-symmetry spin, s, to this dimension we get the relations:

 = 4s,  = 4s + 4,  = 4s + 8, . . .

(4.7)

for each p, the rst operator in this series is a superconformal primary for a chiral short
multiplet with content as in (3.9). the second is also an n = 1 superconformal primary for
a short multiplet, but now with the primary elds listed in (3.12). the rest of the operators
in (4.7) are superconformal primaries for long multiplets of osp (6, 2| 2). this can be seen
both from their dimension, scalars with  > 4s + 6 are superconformal primaries for long
multiplets only, and from the number of states in the multiplet. their dimensions are valid
only in the large n limit, since they can receive corrections of order 1/n when tree-level
supergravity computations are no longer protected by supersymmetry.

for p = 1, only one superconformal operator can be written down, tr . the conformal
primaries in this multiplet are this scalar in the (2,2) of su(2)r  su(2)l and a spinor
in the (1,2). the anti-symmetric tensor of usp(n) is reducible, its symplectic trace is a
singlet and wont mix with other operators. this matches with our understanding of the
p = 1 operators as dual to the pure gauge (i.e., no physical degrees of freedom) ads elds
in the doubleton representation of osp (6, 2| 2). they correspond to the center of mass
motion of the m5-branes parallel to the 9-branes and decouple 7.
we would like to point out that a clear distinction should be drawn between place-
in the n = 2 formalism, the doubleton
holder elds and doubleton degrees of freedom.
and the place-holder multiplet carry the same quantum numbers, so an identication might
be drawn. for n = 1 only the even multiplet of place-holders yields a doubleton, the odd
place-holders are necessary for computing the correct spectrum but cant appear alone in a
trace. thus, the pure-gauge doubleton degrees of freedom of the ads background should
really only be interpreted as decoupled center of mass degrees of freedom for the cft and
bear no direct connection to the place-holder elds.

the odd place-holders rst play a role for the p = 2 operators. the n = 2 super-primary
operator tr   splits into tr , tr , and tr . only the rst and third of these survive
the z2 projection. we list the results in the following table:

7this decoupling of the center of mass degrees of freedom follows from coordinate invariance inside
the 9-brane.

(4.8)

from this table, we can see that we get two massless multiplets for ads7  s4/z2. the rst
is a chiral multiplet and contains the su(2)l gauge eld. the second multiplet contains
the su(2)r gauge eld, the gravitino, and the graviton. these elds couple to the r-
symmetry current, the super-current and the stress-energy tensor of the boundary cft
respectively. the presence of the r-symmetry current and the stress-energy tensor in the
same multiplet xes the relation between r-spin, s, and the dimension, , of the short
multiplets superconformal primaries 8.

the rest of the (1, 0) spectrum dual to the ads7s4/z2 bulk elds can be easily obtained
using the place-holder elds described above. the group theory for projecting down n = 2
multiplets is straightforward and this part of our analysis requires no new understanding
of the kk reduction of 11-dimensional supergravity. because the complete kaluza-klein
spectrum on s4 has already been worked out in [24,25], we only need to identify those bulk
states which survive the z2 projection. its important to note that since we do not have a
lagrangian uv description for the (1, 0) theory, the place-holder formalism is only a labeling
system convenient for doing group theory.

v. kaluza-klein reduction of e8 twisted sector modes

to get the mass spectrum of the kaluza-klein reduction of the e8 twisted sector modes,
one might expect to have to calculate the eigenvalues of the laplace operator for the e8
n = 1 d = 10 vector multiplet reduced on a sphere. luckily, group theory comes to our
rescue again, in a fashion quite similar to that in the analysis of [18]. upon reduction to
ads7 the d = 10 vector multiplet can give only scalars, spinors, and vectors. this implies
that its kk modes must t into chiral short multiplets, since all other multiplets include a
larger set of bosonic elds.

looking at just the bosonic modes, we derive the complete kaluza-klein spectrum. our
only initial bosonic eld is the d = 10 vector eld. it can be reduced on the xed s3 using a
scalar harmonic in the (k,k) of su(2)rsu(2)l or using a vector harmonic in the (k+2,k)
or (k,k+2). these harmonics give a bosonic spectrum of the form

8the fact that the various short multiplets relate  and s dierently is due to the appearance of
null-states at dierent levels.

the columns in this series t easily into chiral multiplets with superconformal primary
scalars in the (k+2,k). the ads energy/dimensions of all these states can be directly
read o from (3.9). just as in [18], scalars coming from the vector harmonics (k+2,k) and
(k,k+2) have dierent ads energies due to a subtlety involving the eigenvalues of the e8
covariant derivative on s3.

the rst multiplet in the series contains the massless vector which carries the e8 gauge
symmetry and couples to the dual e8 current algebra on the ads7 boundary cft. since
this vector comes from a straight reduction on s3, its coupling is proportional to

1/qv ol(s3)  1/n.

vi. discussion

(5.2)

we conclude by giving a summary of chiral gauge invariant relevant and marginal op-
erators for the (1, 0) theory. we make some general remarks on orbifolds in the ads/cft
context, and oer some perspective on the coulomb/higgs branch transition.

we denote operators by their su(2)r  su(2)l  e8 quantum numbers. the relevant

and marginal scalar operators are:

(3, 3, 1), (1, 1, 1), (3, 1, 248)
(4, 4, 1), (2, 2, 1), (4, 2, 248)

with  = 4 (relevant)
with  = 6 (marginal).

(6.1)

all these scalar operators break supersymmetry since they are superconformal primary op-
erators and thus are not annihilated by any supersymmetry transformations. also, from the
analysis of [27] for the relevant scalars of the (2, 0) theory, we dont expect the (3,3,1) and
(1,1,1) operators to lead to any new stable superconformal xed points. on the other hand,
the (3,1,248) scalar operator will very likely be implicated in breaking the (1, 0) theory to
its higgs branch, as any e8 instanton bundle on the xed s3 will excite the corresponding
kaluza-klein mode. this analysis requires a solution of the coupled twisted sector and bulk
modes of ads7  s4/z2 and is beyond the scope of our discussion.
the rest of the relevant and marginal spectrum behaves as expected. the vector spec-
trum yields all the expected dimension ve global symmetry currents for su(2)rsu(2)l
e8. we also nd the super-current and the stress-energy tensor and a relevant 3-form cur-
rent. an important check on our analysis is that only the su(2)r current appears in the
same multiplet as the stress-energy tensor. since this is the only r-symmetry current, any-
thing else would violate the supersymmetry algebra. continuing with this logic, the su(2)l
and e8 symmetry currents need to appear in a dierent kind of short multiplet (one with-
out the stress-energy tensor). clearly, dierentiation in the types of short multiplets must
appear in any situation involving cfts with global symmetries that are not r-symmetries.
one way to understand the appearance of new short multiplets for orbifolds of ads/cft
congurations is by looking more closely at the role of r-symmetry in the shortening process.

11

for example, in the (2, 0) spectrum we start with a superconformal primary operator in
the symmetric-traceless of the so(5) r-symmetry. only the highest weight state in this
representation is annihilated by the supersymmetry transformation, but this is enough to
shorten the superconformal multiplet. when we orbifold to get the (1, 0) theory this single
so(5) representation breaks into multiple surviving su(2)rsu(2)l representations. if we
rank these representations in order of decreasing su(2)l dimension, the rst contains the
highest weight state of so(5) and shortens at level 1. the next (surviving) representation
has a state which annihilates at level 3, and so is the primary for a new kind of short
multiplet. since we cant apply the supersymmetry generators an innite number of times
(they are fermionic), a large enough initial so(5) representation for the superconformal
primary will spawn superconformal primaries for multiplet that never shorten, i.e., long
multiplets.

the appearance of these long multiplets in the kaluza-klein reduced supergravity single
particle spectrum of orbifolds is in itself an interesting occurrence. at tree level the states
in the long multiplets inherit their masses from their (2, 0) theory progenitors. for large
n, these will then be the correct masses, but not necessarily for small n. by contrast, in
the standard story for ads/cft duality, with maximally symmetric spaces, single particle
supergravity states are mapped strictly to operators in short multiplets, i.e., with xed
dimensions. in the large n limit where supergravity is valid only these operators keep nite
dimensions, all other operators have anomalous dimensions that grow with n. in orbifolds,
the new long multiplets provide us with an extra set of single particle operators, whose naive
dimension becomes increasingly correct for large n. this is the kind of behavior usually
associated with multi-trace operators dual to multiple particle supergravity states, where
the interaction energy correction to the naive mass estimate vanishes in the large n limit
(the coupling goes to zero).

the appearance of exotic multiplets in the single particle spectrum of orbifolds can also
be related to the introduction of separate sets of place-holder elds for the dual cft. in
section iv, we separated place-holders into an even and an odd set. the shortest multiplet
(denoted chiral) had all even place-holders, the next shortest had two odd place-holders,
and so on. we expect this to generalize to other orbifolds as follows. the place-holder
elds of the covering space theory will be grouped by their transformation properties under
the dening orbifold quotient operation. preserved operators will correspond to invariant
combinations of these place-holder elds. if more than one type of invariant combination
exists (e.g., even elds, or odd-odd elds), dierent types of multiplets should ensue. note
that only place-holder elds which are singlets under the orbifold operation yield doubleton
elds in ads. therefore, the naive connection between place-holders and doubletons seen in
maximally symmetric spaces breaks down.

returning to specics of the (1, 0) theory, we would like to take a look at the at directions
discussed in the introduction. one problem with the notion of moduli space inherent in that
discussion is that it is usually parameterized in terms of expectation values of elds. in the
conformal eld theory language we can only perturb our vacuum by adding operators to the
theory. the coecients for these additional operators then act as parameters. motion along
one of the at directions of moduli space typically corresponds to adding marginal operators
which are not gauge invariant, and as such were not analyzed in our discussion.

despite this problem it is still possible to look at the moduli space of the (1, 0) theory in

12

the near vicinity of the interacting superconformal xed point. the idea is to move a short
distance along moduli space before taking the near-horizon limit. for example, if we separate
the stack of n m5-branes into two stacks of n/2 m5-branes, we can get a multi-center ads
space describing motion along the coulomb branch. due to the nature of scaling limit,
motion away from the 9-branes will always be limited to be less than lp , so recovery of the
(2, 0) theory of n/2 m5-branes is an innite distance away in moduli space. similarly, one
can hope to analyze the higgs branch by blowing-up e8 instantons on the xed point s3.
this involves solving coupled twisted sector/bulk equations on ads7  s4/z2, and presents
an interesting problem in itself. once again, the scaling limit which yields the ads/cft
correspondence only allows us to travel a short distance along this at direction.
