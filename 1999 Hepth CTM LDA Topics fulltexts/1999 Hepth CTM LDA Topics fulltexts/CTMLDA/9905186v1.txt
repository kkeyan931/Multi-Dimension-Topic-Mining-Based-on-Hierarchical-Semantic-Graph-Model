abstract

in the poincare patch of minkovski ads5 we explicitly construct local bulk elds
from the boundary operators, to leading order in 1/n , following the ideas in [1, 2]. we
also construct the greens function implicitly dened by this procedure. we generalize
the construction of local elds for near horizon geometries of dp branes. we try to
expand the procedure to the interacting case, with partial success.

introduction

in the context of the maldacena conjecture [3, 4, 5], applied to the near horizon geometries

of dp-branes, we consider the possibility of constructing bulk elds from the boundary

operators. it is not obvious that local physics in a d+1 dimensional theory can be obtained

from a d dimensional theory because of the dierent causal structures. more precisely, local

elds in the higher dimensional theory should commute outside of the light cone, which

contains one extra coordinate. commutation of elds at spacelike separations along that

direction is a nontrivial property.

in [1, 2], a method was presented for constructing elds in the bulk of ads5 from the

operators of the boundary cft at leading order in 1/n . in [1], the issue of locality was

explored thoroughly, but the arguments used made heavy use of the conformal structure of

the boundary theory. nevertheless, intuition tells us that it should be possible to construct

local bulk elds in all the cases where the maldacena conjecture applies - i.e. even in cases

where the boundary theories are not conformal. such cases are obtained by looking at
dp-branes with p 6= 3 and at their near horizon geometry.

rather than using arguments having to do with conformal symmetry, we take the hard

approach, explicit construction. this approach is less elegant, but easier to see through,

and has the advantage of easily extending to the nonconformal cases. we rst do the

construction for the ads5 - cft case (in chapter 3) and then for one nonconformal case

(in chapter 4).

we also construct the greens function relating bulk elds with boundary operators, and

explore its properties (in chapter 2). the greens function is not very useful for checking

locality for the bulk elds (unless you are a fan of hypergeometric functions), but is helpful

at understanding the construction. one interesting thing which we explore is the fact that

the greens function is not manifestly causal.

finally, in chapter 5 we present a way to generalize this procedure to the interacting case.

following the line of thought from [1] and our intuition, we believe that the theory in the

bulk remains local in perturbation theory. locality should be broken because of holography,

but probably not perturbatively. we present a way to construct interacting elds and to

check for their locality, at rst order in 1/n . nevertheless, checking for locality is easier said

than done. we encounter computation diculties too big for us. however, we will present

the work done with the hope that some reader with more audacity and more technical

inclinations might bring it to completion.

2 construction of elds and of the greens function on the

poincare patch of ads5

we briey review the bdhm-bklt [1, 2] procedure. in a large n conformal theory, we

can obtain a set of chiral primary operators, with normalized orthogonal 2 point functions:

hoioji  i j,

(2.1)

to leading order in 1/n . this looks like a free theory in which the ois are the independent

free elds. it is possible therefore to use their fourier components, which behave as creation

and annihilation operators to construct bulk free elds. a bulk eld is constructed by

multiplying the creation and annihilation operators by the appropriate normalized solutions

of the bulk equation of motion.

are

in our case, the boundary is r3  r1, so the creation and annihilation operators

and its conjugate ok,. here,  > 0.

the poincare patch of ads has the metric:

ds2 =

0

(dt2 + dz2

0 + dz2)

(2.3)

the equation of motion for a eld of mass m is easy to obtain, and has 2 independent

solutions:

and

where   4 + m2, and j and n are bessel functions of the rst kind. the boundary
operator whose fourier components are the creations and annihilation operators of a bulk
eld with mass m has dimension  = 2 + 4 + m2. the exact prescription [1, 6] relating
bulk elds and boundary operators is :

i(t, x, z0) = z

0 oi(t, x).

lim
z00

(2.6)

because of general properties of eld theories, the operators ok, and ok, only exist
for  > |k|. this is consistent with the fact that one can only obtain a solution of the

f 1 properly normalized should be used as the mode function. thus,

this equation implicitly denes a greens function, which due to the abundance of this

type of things in the literature we will call transfer function. thus,

where z and b are the generic coordinates in the bulk, respectively the boundary. hence

g(z, z0, t, x,  ) =

(2.9)
we can see that because we eliminated the modes with  < |k|, the transfer function will
not be proportional to a  function when z0  0. thus, it is dierent from the analytical
continuation of the greens function obtained in [4]. also, as we will see, this is the reason

!

2

for its lack of manifest causality.

finding g explicitly is not hard, just a bit messy. we can rst perform the angular part
of the integral, by choosing z  x  x as our main axis. thus, k(z  x) = kx cos ,
where 0 <  < /2,  < k < . the choice of range for  and k is a bit unusual, but
makes the computation easier. thus,

(2.11)

the second integral can be evaluated dierently when x > t and when t > x.

we will present the rst case only. the second one can be obtained through analytic

continuation. substituting x = x2  t2 cosh s, t = x2  t2 sinh s, and l =

y + s the second integral becomes after a few steps:

(2.13)

in the case t > x, k1 simply becomes h1. here, j, n, h and k denote the appropriate

bessel functions. the integral is not hard to perform. using [9] (6.576 3) we obtain

g =

(2.14)

as it is well known, the hypergeometric function has poles at 0, 1 and , and can be

analytically continued inside the light cone.

we have obtained a transfer function which does not look causal. this is because its

limit as the bulk coordinate goes to the boundary is not proportional to a  function. thus,

we need to know the boundary eld all over the poincare patch in order to obtain the bulk

eld at a point. this contradicts our intuition that an excitation of the boundary should

propagate causally in the bulk. we can see that we can only obtain a causal looking transfer

function by working in the universal cover of ads. in that case, we can regard the poincare

patch where the boundary operators are as one in the back light cone of the bulk point,

and thus have manifest causality.

3 locality in the bulk - the conformal case

in order to check the locality of the bulk elds dened in (2.7), we need to nd the commu-

tator of  with itself, and with its time derivative. one attempt at checking locality would

be to use (2.14), but the computation is hard, and obscures the physics going on. more
intuitive is to go in small steps. thus, we would like to nd the commutators [ok,, ok,]
and [ok,, ok,] in the boundary theory, and combine them with (2.7) in order to obtain

the commutator of the eld with itself and with its time derivative. to do this, we rst

have to nd [o(x, t), o(0, 0)]. this can be done in two ways: by analytically continuing

from the euclidean case, or by using kallen-lehmann representation.

we know that for properly normalized os, in the euclidean case,

ho(x,  ), o(0, 0)i =

1

(x2 +  2) ,

(3.1)

where  is the dimension of the operator o. we can obtain the time ordered and the anti

time ordered correlation functions by analytically continuing under or above the poles at
 = x and  = x. for t > 0, [o(x, t), o(0, 0)] = ht o(x, t)o(0, 0)i  ha o(x, t)o(0, 0)i.

4

thus

[o(x, t), o(0, 0)] = 2i sin()(t2  x2)sgn(t)

.

(3.2)

(t2  x2)

the formula above may look a bit puzzling for integer dimension operators, nevertheless,

it only tells us is that the commutator is nonzero only on the light cone.

we can also note that for a free eld of mass m,

h(x,  ), (0, 0)ie =

k1(mx2 +  2)

x2 +  2

,

[(x, t), (0, 0)]m =

ij1(mt2  x2)

t2  x2

(t2  x2)sgn(t),

(3.3a)

(3.3b)

where the labels e and m stand for euclidean and minkovskian. we can use the kallen-

lehmann representation:

ho(x,  ), o(0, 0)ie = z 
[o(x, t), o(0, 0)]m = z 

0

0

dm2 f (m2) h(x,  ), (0, 0)ie,

dm2 f (m2) [(x, t), (0, 0)]m ,

(3.4a)

(3.4b)

and extract f (m2) from (3.4a) and (3.1), plug it back in (3.4b) and reobtain (3.2). the

integral in the kallen-lehmann representation runs from 0, because there is no mass scale

in a conformal theory.

since we dened ok, to correspond to positive frequency, we can easily see that
[ok,, ok,] = 0, since their commutator contains a ( + ). the same is true for
the os. by looking at the poincare invariance of the boundary theory, it is quite easy
to see that the commutator [ok,, ok,] will contain (  )(k  k). since the theory
is conformal, the product of  functions must be multiplied by an appropriate power of

2 k2. we can also compute [ok,, ok,] by using brute force. combining (2.2) and (3.2)

is straightforward, and after a few steps in which we use techniques similar to the ones on

pag. 2, we obtain:

[ok,, ok,] = (2  k2)2(  )(k  k)c,

(3.5)

where c is a numerical constant (

3

225()(1) for the curious reader). we understand

(v) of a d-dimensional vector v to be the appropriate d-dimensional  function.

using (3.5) and (2.7) we can show that the bulk elds are local. there are three things

to check:

1 - [(t, z, z0), (t, z, z0)] = 0,
2 - [(t, z, z0), 

t (t, z, z0)]  (z0  z0)(z  z)

5

3 - [(t, z, z0), 

t (t, z, z0)] = 0 outside of the light cone.

in fact, condition 3 should follow from 2, because of the symmetry of the bulk, but it is
nice to show how it works out. we can x without loss of generality t and z to 0. using
(2.7) and (3.5) we have

[(0, z, z0), (0, 0, z0)]  z2

[(t, z, z0), (0, 0, z0)]  z2

0z>|k|

using the same change of variable as at the evaluation of (2.9), we obtain

(3.8)

for t = 0, it is easier to use (3.7), and replace  d by a da. the integrals over d3k and
da separate, and the d3k integral gives us (z). we are left with

(3.9a)

the integral is proportional to (z0  z0), by the orthogonality relation of bessel functions.
thus, we have checked the second relation. we did not keep all the constants along the

way for the sake of clarity. the exact answer is:

[, ] = z3

0(z0  z0)(z)

22i

()(  1)

(3.9b)

in order to check the third relation we have to look at the range we are in. for z > t, we

can make the same substitution as in (2.10): z = z2  t2 cosh s, and t = z2  t2 sinh s,

from (3.7) we obtain after making a change of variable:

imz 



dy sinh y cosh y eia(sinh yz+cosh yt) = cosh 2sz 
z2  t2 (a).

cosh 2s



=

dy sinh y cosh y sin(apz2  t2 sinh y)

(3.10)

clearly the commutator vanishes for this range, because of the high power of a in (3.8).

for z = t, we will have an extra term of the form 1
a2

in the last line of (3.10) .

the original term will vanish again because of the high power of a in (3.8), and the extra
term will also vanish for z0 6= z0, because of the orthogonality relation of bessel functions.

(z2t2)

for t > z, we substitute t = t2  z2 cosh s, and z = t2  z2 sinh s, and get

= sinh 2sz

(3.11)

(3.12)

using [9](6.578-8), and remembering that j2(x) = j2(x), we can see that the integral
vanishes for |z0  z0| > t2  z2, e.g. outside of the light cone, which is what was expected.

4 the non conformal case

we can look at the near horizon metric and dilaton for a collection of n dp branes, for a

general p:

p = " u (7p)/2
gy m n 1/2 dx2
gy m n 1/2!(p3)/2

k +

e = g2

.

gy m n 1/2
u (7p)/2 (du 2 + u 2d2

8p)#,

(4.1)

here gy m is the coupling constant for the theory on the brane. supergravity is a valid

description for the bulk theory in the range where both the dilaton and the scalar curvature
are small. in the case of d2 branes, which we will explore later, this is g2
y m n 1/5 < u <
g2
y m n . a more general analysis of other cases can be found in [7]. we look at the limit of
gy m and n where this is all the bulk.

we expect the construction to work in all the nonconformal cases, since by the conjecture

[3] the hilbert spaces are the same. nevertheless, we will only illustrate the case of the d2

brane. the machinery is very similar to the one we had to crank in the conformal case. thus,

for a bulk scalar with angular momentum l, the euclidean correlator of the corresponding

boundary operators is [8]:

ho(x,  ), o(0, 0)i =

b

(x2 +  2) ,

where b  n (5+2l)/3

with b  b up to a factor of order unity, which the curious reader can compute in the
same way as in the previous chapter.

interactions

we have constructed local elds only to leading order in 1/n .

it is true that locality

should ultimately be broken in the bulk, because of holography, but we believe this to be

a nonperturbative eect. thus it should be possible in principle to construct bulk local

elds perturbatively in 1/n . so, we can ask the question: can we repeat the bdhm-bklt

construction for interacting cases ?

at next to leading order in 1/n , the boundary theory no longer looks like a free theory.

rather, for i 6= j (3.1) is replaced by:

oi(xi)oj(xj) =

1

n xk z ddxqijk(x|x1, x2)ok(x),

where qijk(x|x1, x2) can be obtained from the boundary 3-point function.

also, the bulk theory will have extra terms in the lagrangian, of the form

lint = dijkijk.

(5.1)

(5.2)

we expect (2.6) to be valid in the interacting case as well. the practical way to check

locality to next to leading order in 1/n is to use the interacting bulk equations of motion for

the boundary free operators, and compare the result with the one obtained using the free

bulk equation of motion for the boundary interacting theory. if the 1/n contributions

cancel outside of the light cone, the bulk elds are local.

nevertheless, the computation is very hard. we tried to compute the commutator of

bulk elds using the boundary interacting theory and the free equations of motion, but

the technical diculties were too big for us. as we said in the introduction, we cannot but

hope that some reader with more audacity and more technical inclinations might bring it

to completion.

9

6 conclusions

there are two new results in this paper. the rst one is the computation of the transfer

function relating boundary operators with bulk elds, in the context of the ads-cft

correspondence.

the second one is the expansion of the bdhm-bklt procedure to nonconformal cases.

we presented a method of constructing bulk elds in the near-horizon geometry of a col-

lection of dp branes, and veried locality explicitly for the d2 brane case.
