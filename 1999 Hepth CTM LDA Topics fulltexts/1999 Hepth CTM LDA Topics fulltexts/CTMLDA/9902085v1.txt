abstract

the full set of polynomial solutions of the nested bethe ansatz is
constructed for the case of a2 rational spin chain. the structure and
properties of these associated solutions are more various then in the
case of usual xxx (a1) spin chain but their role is similar.

1. introduction

in our previous paper [1] we have considered the famous baxter t  q
equations [5] for the simplest cases of xxx and xxz spin chains.
in
particular, we have shown that for each solution of bethe equations there
exists the associated solution with the same eigenvalue of the transfer matrix
t (). this solution does not dene any bethe state, however its consideration
is proven to be very usefull.

the matter is that the associated polynomials q() and p () form the

full set of solutions of t  q equation.

t ()q() = (  i/2)n q( + i) + ( + i/2)n q(  i),

(1)

1

which may be considered as the second order nite dierence equation with
respect to q(). similar to the case of the second order dierential equations
we can express the coecients of (1) via its solutions q, p :

p ( + i/2)q(  i/2)  p (  i/2)q( + i/2) = n ,

t () = p ( + i)q(  i)  p (  i)q( + i).

(2)

(3)

it is remarkable that the equation (2) may serve as the starting point for con-
struction of the eigenvalues of the transfer matrix t . the set of polynomial
solutions of this equation reproduces the spectrum t () via (3).

the considered construction corresponds to the case when the fundamen-
tal set of quantum operators belongs to the algebra a1 (and its deformations).
in the present paper we start the qeneralization of our approach to the case
of algebras an. for the sake of simplicity we limit ourselves with a2 case.
here we consider only the case of isotropic a2 spin chain leaving the de-
formed case for future publications. we shall show that each solution of the
nested bethe ansatz equations is associated to ve additional solutions cor-
responding to the same eigenvalue of transfer matrix. also it will be shown
that the third order nite dierence equation, which is an analogue of baxter
equation for the case a2 has the full set of polynomial solutions q, p, r. the
corresponding wronskian has the following form:

det(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

q(  i) q() q( + i)
p (  i) p () p ( + i)
r(  i) r() r( + i)

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

= n .

(4)

the polynomial solutions of this equation form the full spectrum of a2 trans-
fer matrices. for example, the eigenvalues of transfer matrices, corresponding
to two fundamental representations are given by:

det(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

q(  3i/2) q(  i/2) q( + 3i/2)
p (  3i/2) p (  i/2) p ( + 3i/2)
r(  3i/2) r(  i/2) r( + 3i/2)

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

= t ().

(5)

apparently these equations substitute the equations (2) and (3) for the case
of a2.

2.various formulations of nested bethe ansatz

the exact formulation of the model one can nd e.g. in [2].
diagonalization of transfer matrix and corresponding hamiltonian has
been done with the help of so called nested bethe ansatz [3], which could be
constructed in the frameworks of qism (see e.g. [4]).

let us remind the general setup of the nested bethe ansatz equations for
the case a2 spin chain. let n be the length of the chain and n1 and n2 - are
nonnegative integers subject to the conditions:

n1  n/3, n2  2n/3,

2n1  n2.

(6)

the corresponding bethe state is dened by n1 + n2 parameters which we
denote as:

(1)

j

(j = 1, 2, . . . n1),

(2)

k

(k = 1, 2, . . . n2).

(8)

let us dene the pair of polynomials q1() and q2() of the degrees n1 and
n2 correspondingly by the equations:

q1() =

n1

yj =1

(  (1)

j  ), q2() =

n2

yk=1

(  (2)
k ).

(9)

making use of these polynomials we can present the equation (8) in the
following form:

j  i)q2((1)

(j = 1, 2, . . . n1);

(10)

(k = 1, 2, . . . n2).

if all roots of the polynomials q1() and q2() are simple, the equations
(10) implies:

)q1(  i) + q2( 

i
2

i
2
)n q1( +

q2( +

( +

= t1()q2(),

)q1( + i) = t2()q1(),

(11)

i
2

)q2(  i) + ( 

i
2

)n q1( 

i
2

)q2( + i) =

(12)

where t1() and t2() are new polynomials whose meaning will be clear in
the sequel.

the eigenvalues of transfer matrix t () enter into the game via the folow-
2 and

ing construction. shifting the argument in the equation (11) by  i
combining the result with the equation (12), we obtain:

{t1() + ( 
{( 

i
2
)n t2( 

3i
)n q1( 
2
i
) + ( 
2

i
2

)}q2() =
i
)n q2(  i)}q1( 
2

(13)

i
2

),

suppose now that q2() and q1( i
roots). then the last equation implies the following important formulas:

2) are mutually simple (have no common

t1() + (

),

) = t ()q1( 
i
)n q2(  i)} = t ()q2(),
2

(14)

where t () are the polynomials of the degree n, which are the eigenvalues of
the transfer matrices corresponding to the ajoint fundamental representations
of a2 the auxiliary space.

combining four equations of the system (14) we can nd two relations

where the polynomials t1() and t2() do not enter:

)  n (  i)n q2( +

) = 0. (16)

these equations, which we shall meet once more later, we can solve with
respect to t ():

i

)q1()q2( 

t ( 
+(  i)n{q1( + i)q2( 

i

i
2

) = n q1()q2( 

3i
2

) +

) + q1(  i)q2( +

i
2

)}.

(17)

in contradistinction with (11,12) these equations are homogenious with
respect to q1 and q2 and do not contain auxiliary polynomials t1 and t2. in
the same time, (17) are equivalent to (11, 12). to prove this statement it is
sucient to note that r.h.s. of (17) should devide on to q1(), and q2( i
2)).
the equations (11, 12) are the manifestations of these requirements.

2. associated solutions of the nested bethe ansatz

let us return to the system:

)q1(  i) + q2( 

i
2

i
2
)n q1( +

q2( +

( +

i
2

= t1()q2(),

i
2

)q2(  i) + ( 

i
2

)n q1( 

i
2

)q2( + i) =

(19)

)q1( + i) = t2()q1(),

(18)

in what follows we shall consider several systems of this kind, so let us in-
troduce a special short notation for it:

{q1, q2; t1, t2}.

(20)

each of these two equations can be viewed as a kind of t q baxter equation
[5] for some inhomogenious xxx - spin chain. for example, equation (18)
may be considered as t q for the chain of the length n2 with inhomogenities
dened by the roots of the polynomial q2(). according to the results of our
previous paper [1] there exists the polynomial p1() of the degree n2n1 + 1,
which together with q() satises to:

q2( 

i
2

)p1( + i) + q2( +

i
2

)p1(  i) = t2()p1().

(21)

5

in the same time, the functions q2 and t2 which play the role of coecients
in the equation (18) may be expressed in terms of two independent solutions:
q1 and p1:

i
2

i
2

)q1( +
q2() = p1( +
t2() = p1( + i)q1(  i)  p1(  i)q1( + i).

)  p1( 

)q1( 

i
2

i
2

),

(22)

the second equation (19) also may be considered as t  q equation but
for spin chain of the length n + n1. now the polynomial n q1() serves
as inhomogenity. again, according to ([1]) the second solution p2() is the
polynomial of the degree n + n1  n2 + 1:
(
the construction similar to (22) yields:

)p2(i) = t1()p2(). (23)

)  p2( 

)q2( 

)q2( +

i
2

i

i

(24)

let us compare the rst equations from the systems (22) and (24):

q2() = p1( +

i
2
n q1() = p2( +

i
2
)q2( 

)q1( 
i
2

i
2
)  p2( 

)  p1( 
i

i
2
excluding q2 from this system we obtain the factorized equation:

)q2( +

),

i

)q1( +

),

(25)

i

i

)p1(  i)} =

i
2
)q1(  i)}.

i
2

)p1( + i) + p2( +

(26)

let q1() and p1() are mutually simple (this is equivalent to the mutual
2)). then there exists the polynomial t2(),
simplicity of q2() and q1(  i
satisfying to:

p2( +

p2( +

i

i
2

)q1(  i) + p2( 
)p1(  i) + p2( 

)q1( + i) = t2()q1(),

i
2
i
)p1( + i) + n = t2()p1().

(27)

remarkable that equation (23) and the rst equation in (27) form the new
pair of equations for the nested bethe ansatz, which in our notations could
be written as: {q1, p2; t1, t2}. note that according to the rst equation of
the system (14), this pair corresponds to the same eigenvalues of transfer
matrices t (), as in the case of {q1, q2; t1, t2}
on the next step, starting again from the system (25) we shall exclude
the polynomial q1. repeating the above procedure we arrive at the following
equations:

i
2

i
2

)q2(  i) + ( 

i
2

)n p1( 

i
2

)q2( + i) =

( +

)n p1( +

= t1()q2(),

)p2(  i) + ( 
2
i
)n = t1()p2().
2

i
2

)n p1( 

i
2

)p2( + i) +

(28)

in other words this results in the system {p1, q2; t1, t2}.

all discussion of this section may formulated as the following
proposition on the associated solutions of the nested bethe

ansatz equations.

let we have the solution {q1, q2; t1, t2} of the bethe equations (18,19).
degrees of the polynomials in the brackets are (n1, n2; n +n1, n2) correspond-
ingly.

then, there exist the pair of associated solutions {q1, p2; t1, t2} and
{p1, q2; t1, t2}, for which the degrees are: (n1, n + n1  n2 + 1; n + n1, n +
n1  n2 + 1) and (n2  n1 + 1, n2; n + n2  n1 + 1, n2).
3. complex of the solutions of the nested bethe ansatz equations

each of two associated solutions {q1, p2; t1, t2} and {p1, q2; t1, t2}, could
be considered as a result of two operations f1 f2 on the initial solution
{q1, q2; t1, t2}:

f1{q1, q2; t1, t2} = {p1, q2; t1, t2},
f2{q1, q2; t1, t2} = {q1, p2; t1, t2}

(29)

7

the smart reader can get an impression that there exist an innite set
of the associated solutions. however, these two operations f1 and f2 form
a nite group. this, in turn, guarantees a niteness of the number of the
associated solutions.

indeed, rst of all, let us remark that two successive applications of the
operation f1 (f2) return us back to the initial solution. in other words these
operations are the involutions:

f 2
1 = f 2

2 = i.

(30)

the next nontrivial operations are the products: f2f1, f1f2f1 et cetera
and the set with replacement f1  f2. the key statement is that this set
is actually nite because f1 and f2 satisfy to artin relation:

this relation results in the following structure of the whole set of nested
bethe ansatz solutions:

f1f2f1 = f2f1f2

(31)

f1 
{p1, q2; t1, t2}
 f2
{p1, r2; t1, t 2}
f1 

{q1, q2; t1, t2}

{r1, r2; t 1, t 2}

f2 
{q1, p2; t1, t2}
f2 
{r1, p2; t 1, t2}
f2 

(32)

to prove this statement, rst of all, recall that t () dened in (14) are
invariants under f1,f2 operations. the matter is that each of these opera-
tions do not change one of two pairs qi, ti and due to (14) it is sucient for
conservation of t ().

now let us consider equations (15,16) from the rst section:

i
2

( +

)n q1( 
i
+t ()q1( +

3i
i
)  t +()q1(

3i
)  n (  i)n q2( +

) +

) = 0. (34)

these equations may be considered as linear homogenious nite dierence
equations of the third order for polynomials q1 and q2. the invariants t ()
play the role of the coecients. the equations have three lineary independent
solutions: q1, p1, r1, and q2, p2, r2, correspondingly. if the relation (31) is
not valid, i.e. the chain of solutions (32) is longer then we should obtain
more then three solutions to each equations (33,34), what is impossible.

4. concluding remarks

in our previous paper ([1]) we have considered two fundamental polyno-
mial solutions to baxter t  q-equation. these solutions may be considered
as the fundamental objects in the integrable a1 spin chain models. they give
rise to all possible fusion relations for the transfer matrices corresponding to
dierent spin in the auxiliary space and the transfer matrices themselfs could
be expressed in terms of these polynomial solutions.

for the case a2 spin chain we expect that six polynomial solutions (32)
play the same role. indeed, let us remind that the polynomials q1,p1 and
r1 are the solutions of the equation (33):

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

q1(  3i

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

excluding t () from this system we get the following equation:

= 0.

(35)

(36)

det(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

q1(  i) q1() q1( + i)
p1(  i) p1() p1( + i)
r1(  i) r1() r1( + i)

= n .

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

this equation is analog of the fundamental wronskian (16) from paper
([1]). as in the case of a1 the (36) can be considered as the starting point

9

for construction of the polynomials q1, p1, r1 and consequently the transfer
matrices t ():

= t ().

(37)

det(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

q1(  3i/2) q1(  i/2) q1( + 3i/2)
p1(  3i/2) p1(  i/2) p1( + 3i/2)
r1(  3i/2) r1(  i/2) r1( + 3i/2)

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

consider for example the case of 3-sites chain n = 3. the full set of

polynomial solutions of the equation (36) in this case is:

number q()

3  3
2 + 3 4  23
3 + 3
2  3 4 + 23
2 + 1

3

these four solutions correspond to four irreducible representations which
enter into decomposition of the product of n = 3 fundamental representa-
tions:

3  3  3 = 1 + 8 + 8 + 10

(38)

note that we can express in terms of these polynomials not only t () which
correspond to the fundamental representations in the auxiliary space but also
transfer matrices for any other representations of a2.

similar relations exist also for the polynomials q2, p2, r2. taking into
account the rst equation (22) one can establish that these relations are not
independent.

in the paper ([6]) the authors also have considered the an case of nested
bethe anzats equations using the analogues of t q baxter equations. how-
ever, in their approach the regularization by means of external magnetic
eld is essential and it is not known how to remove this regularization.
therefore, we at the present time unable to compare our results.
