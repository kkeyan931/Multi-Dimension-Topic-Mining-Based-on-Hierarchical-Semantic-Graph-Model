the propagators in axial-type, light-cone and planar gauges con-
(k)p -type singularities. these singularities have generally been
tain
treated by inventing prescriptions for them. in this work, we propose
an alternative procedure for treating these singularities in the path
integral formalism using the known way of treating the singularities
in lorentz gauges. to this end, we use a nite eld-dependent brs
transformation that interpolates between lorentz-type and the axial-
type gauges. we arrive at the -dependent tree propagator in the
axial-type gauges. we examine the singularity structure of the propa-
gator and nd that the axial gauge propagator so constructed has no
spurious poles (for real k). it however has a complicated structure in
a small region near   k = 0. we show how this complicated structure
can eectively be replaced by a much simpler propagator.

theory [1]. hence, the practical calculations in electroweak and strong in-
teractions are calculations in a gauge theory requiring a choice of gauge.
the two choices of gauges most frequently employed are the lorentz-type
and the axial-type gauges. (the latter include the light-cone gauges (lcg)
and planar gauges, while the former include r-gauges in spontaneously bro-
ken gauge theories (sbgt).) the lorentz-type gauges have been popular on
account of their lorentz covariance, simplicity of feynman rules and avail-
ability of a gauge parameter to ensure gauge independence of physical results.
the disadvantage of lorentz-type gauges is however the presence of faddeev-
popov ghosts and relatively large number of feynman diagrams needed for
evaluation of greens functions. the axial-type gauges, on the other hand,
have the advantage of formal decoupling of ghosts [2]. this leads to a much
smaller number of diagrams to be evaluated. these gauges are particularly
useful in perturbative qcd calculations [3]. in fact the rst qcd calcula-
tions were done in these gauges [4].

the main disadvantage of axial-type gauges arises from the lack of lorentz
covariance and especially from the appearance of 1/( k)p-type spurious sin-
gularities in propagators. much literature has been devoted to the question of
how these singularities should be treated [2, 5]. prescriptions have been pro-
posed to deal with this issue: two important ones of these are the principal-
value prescription  (pvp)[6] and the mandelstam-leibbrandt (ml) pre-
scriptions [7]. these, however, have lead in many cases to diculties. the
pvp procedure fails for lcg already at the on loop level and yields the
wrong answer for the wilson loop to order g4[2].

moreover, there are instances where the ghosts need to be taken into
account [2]. in canonical quantization, the treatment of 1/  k-type singu-
larities has been given for axial gauges of the from a1 + a3 = 0[8] (this
does not include lcg).

in this work, we advocate an ab-initio and fresh approach to the question
of the axial gauge propagator based on earlier works [9, 10, 11, 12, 13]. the
approach here utilizes a nite eld-dependent brs transformation estab-
lished earlier between the lorentz-type and the axial-type gauge[9, 10, 11].
this transformation has been used to write down a compact expression that
interpolates between greens functions from the axial-type gauges to the
lorentz-type gauges [12]. we apply the results of [12] to the relation be-
tween the axial and the lorentz gauge propagator. the procedure we adopt
is detailed below.

2

we know how the 1/k2 singularities of the propagator are handled in the
lorentz gauges. these are in eect, treated by replacing k2 by k2 +i. where
the poles have physical interpretation, this amount to propagation of positive
frequency waves into future and negative frequency waves into the past as the
feynman propagator for a physical eld shows. this is taken into account in

a lorentz covariant manner by introduction of a term r d4x(a2/2  cc) to

the action. introduction of such a term also has natural interpretation in the
minkowskian formulation of lorentz gauge theories. this is elaborated in
section 3. we start from this well-established procedure in lorentz gauges.
we then perform a nite eld-dependent brs transformation [9, 10] (a non-
local eld transformation) that converts the lorentz to the axial gauges.
this procedure, following the work [13] leads us to an expression for the tree
-dependent propagator for the gauge eld in the axial gauges. we suggest
that this expression, should, in principle be used for the axial gauges propa-
gator. we analyze the singularity structure of the propagator and nd that
for real   k, there are no spurious poles. the propagator reduces to the
usual propagator for |  k| >> ; however, it show a complex structure in a
small region near   k = 0. we show that this propagator can equally well
be replaced by an eective simpler expression.
our prescription, by its very construction, has the desirable propertry
that it preserves the value of the wilson loop [14]. this is so because the
eld transformation of [9] and [12] was explicitly constructed to preserve
the expectation values of gauge-invariant observables as you go from gauge
to gauge. this is unlike the other prescriptions where the property has to
be imposed as a check on the prescription. for more comments, please see
reference [15].

we now briey state the plan of the paper. in section 2, we review the
results needed in this work. in particular we introduce the ffrbs transfor-
mations and the results of references [12] and [13]. in section 3, we obtain

the eect of r d4x(a2/2  cc) term in the lorentz gauge generating func-

tional. in section 4, we work out the -dependent axial gauge propagator in
detail. in section 5, we examine the singularity structure of the propagator.
in section 6, we show how the propagator can eectively be replaced by a
much simpler expression. section 7 has the conclusion.

2 summary of results on ffbrs transfor-
mation between lorentz- and axial-type
gauges

2.1 notations and conventions

we start with the faddeev-popov eective action (fpea) in linear lorentz-
type gauges:

sl

e[a, c, c] = z d4x(cid:18)

f 

f ,(cid:19) + sgf + sgh,

(1)

where the gauge-xing action sgf is given by:

sl
gf = 

1

2 z d4xx

(  a)2  

1

2 z d4xx

(f 

l [a])2,

(2)

and the ghost action sgh is given by:

where

sl

gh = z d4xcm c,

m [a(x)]  d

 (a, x).

the covariant derivative is dened by:

d
   + gf a
.

in a similar manner, the fpea in axial-type gauges, is given by:

sa
gf

2 z d4xx

(  a)2

2 x z d4x(f

we require  to be real, but otherwise unrestricted. and

gh = z d4xc m c,

m  = d

(9)

thus, in the presence of the delta function, the a-dependent term in m can
be dropped leading to the formally ghost-free matrix. as is well known, sl
e
and sa

e are invariant under the brs transformations:

,

(10)

where f [a] =   a or   a, depending on whether one has action in
the lorentz or the axial-type gauges. we also need the interpolating mixed
gauge with

and the associated ghost term

e has a brs symmetry under transformations (10)

we write in general, the brs transformations in this case as:

brsi = (1i[] + 2i[]).

(13)

2.2 ffbrs transformations

as observed by joglekar and mandal [9], in (10),  need not be innites-
imal nor need it be eld-independent as long as it does not depend on x
explicitly for (10) to by a symmetry of fpea in fact, the following nite
eld-dependent brs (ffbrs) transformations were introduced:

 + d

 c(x)[]

f c(x)c(x)[]

 = a
a 
c  = c 
c  = c +

g

f [a]

[],

(14)

or generically

i(x) = i(x) + brsi(x)[],

(15)

where [] is an x-independent functional of a, c, c (generically denoted
by i) and these were also the symmetry of the fpea. the transformations
of the form (14) were used to connect actions of dierent kinds for yang-
mills theory in [9] and [10]. the fpea is invariant under (14), but the
functional measure is not invariant under the (nonlocal) transformations (14).
the jacobian for the ffbrs transformations can be expressed (in special
cases dealt with in [9, 10]) eectively as exp(is1) and this s1 explains the
dierence between the two eective actions. such ffbrs transformations
were constructed in [9],[10] by integration of an innitesimal eld-dependent
brs (ifbrs) transformation:

di(x, )

d

= brs[(x, )][(x, )]

(16)

the integration of (16) from  = 0 to 1, leads to the ffbrs transformation
of (15) with ( = 1)   and ( = 0) = . further  in (15) was related
to  by:

[] = []

f []

exp[f []]  1

,

(17)

(18)

where

f [] = xi z d4x



i(x)

brsi(x)

ffbrs transformations of the type (15) were used to connect the fpea
in lorentz-type gauges with gauge parameter  to (i) the most general
brs/anti-brs symmetric action in linear gauges, (ii)fpea in quadratic
gauges, (iii) the fpea in lorentz-type gauges with another gauge parame-
ter  in [9]. it was also used to connect the former to fpea in axial-type
gauges in [10]. we shall now summarize the results of [10] in 2.3.

2.3 ffbrs transformation for lorentz to axial gauge

se

we give the results for the ffbrs transformation that connects the lorentz-
type gauges (see (1)) with gauges parameter  to axial gauges (see (6)) with

6

same gauge parameter .
[the same calculation can be used to connect
it to axial gauges with another gauge parameter : one simply rescales 
suitably.] they are obtained by integrating:

di()

d

= brs[][],

with

 = iz d4xc(  a    a).

the consequent [] is given by (17) with

f [] = iz d4x"   a



(  a    a) + c(  d    d)c#.

(19)

(20)

(21)

the meaning of these eld transformations is as follows. suppose we
begin with vacuum expectation value of a gauge invariant functional g[] in
the lorentz-type gauges:

hhg[]ii  z dg[]eisl

e [].

(22)

now, we perform the transformation    given by (15). then we have
[with g[] = g[] by gauge invariance]

hhg[]ii  hhg[]ii = z dj[]g[]eisl

e []

on account of the brs invariance of sl

e. here j[] is the jacobian

d = dj[].

(23)

(24)

as was shown in [9], for the special case g[]  1, the jacobian j[] in (24),
can be replaced by eis1[] where

sl
e[] + s1[] = sa

e[].

(25)

as shown in section iii of [12], this replacement is valid for any gauge in-
variant g[] functional of a. if one were to live with vacuum expectation
values of gauge invariant observables, the ffbrs in [9] would be sucient.
but as seen in [12], general greens functions need a modied treatment.

2.4 relations between greens functions in axial- and

lorentz-type gauges

the ffbrs in 2.3 was used to correlate arbitrary greens functions in the
lorentz-type and axial-type gauges [12] let o[] represent any eld operator
(local or multi-local). then the relation between the greens functions in the
two gauges is given by:

e []

hho[]iia  z do[]eisa
= z d(cid:18)o[] +xi
 hho[] +xi

o
iiil,

i[]

i[]

o

i(cid:19)eisl

where

f1[]  iz d4x(cid:20)   a
f2[]  



i

 z d4x(  a    a)2,
  iz d4xc(  a    a).

and

the relation (26) can be used to related the ordinary greens functions,
operator greens functions, etc.
in the two set of gauges depending on the
choice of o[].

a much more convenient and tractable result was also derived in [13]

hoia = hoil +z 1

where sm
e is the fpea for the mixed gauge function with the gauge xing
term dened in (11) and 1,i and 2,i have been dened in (13). of course,
2,i is non-vanishing only for c eld.

3 the general procedure for generating pre-

scription

in this section, we shall outline the general procedure for generating the cor-
rect treatment for 1
k singularities in the axial-type gauges starting from the
lorentz-type gauges. in the lorentz-type gauges, also there is a singularity in
the propagator at k2 = 0 in both the gauge and the ghost propagators. this,
in analogy with the scalar particle, is dealt with by adding an i term, viz
k2  k2 + i ( is small positive) in the denominators. as is well known, this
prescription allows the propagation of positive energy solutions into future
and the negative energy solutions into the past. the role of this prescription
in the lorentz-type gauges can also be understood clearly in the minkowskian
formulation of quantum eld theory. the above prescription is implemented
by an addition of the term i 
2 aa to the gauge eld action. in the context
of a scalar theory, the i2 term provides a damping in the path integral:

w = z dei(s+i2)

(32)

for large . in the context of gauge theories, we expect the -dependent term
to be determined by similar damping provided in the transverse degrees of
freedom. then the form of the term in the context of a covariant formulation
viz iaa/2 is determined by covariance. thus, this treatment of the 1
k2 -
type singularity is well understood in the lorentz-type gauges. further, there
are wt identities for greens functions that have terms that involve both the
ghost and the gauge propagators. their exact preservation requires that a
similar modication be made in the ghost propagator poles 1/k2  1/k2 + i.
thus, the path integral for h0|0i in the lorentz- type gauges we normally start
with, is given in minkowski space, by:

ei 

2 aa+icc]

w l = z dei[sl
 z deisl

e []+io1[a,c,c,].

9

(33)

we now expect that if we start with this w l that has no pole prescription
ambiguities and make suitable eld transformation (as outlined in section
2) to the axial gauges, we should obtain an ambiguity-free treatment of the
axial gauge propagator. we thus imagine making the eld transformation of
(15) viz:

i(x) = i(x) + brs[i][]

(34)

with [] given explicitly by (17), (20) and (21).

as shown in [12], the eect of this eld transformation can be evaluated

via the formula (26), and is given by:

e []+io1[]

w l = z deisl
= z deisa

e []+io

1[]

o1 = o1 +xi

i[]

o
i

.

sa
e   sa

e + o1

(35)

(36)

(37)

(38)

(39)

(40)

with

we regard the net exponent, including the new o() terms, viz.

as given correct the treatment of the axial gauge poles. we can now, in
principle, evaluate the eect of the o1 term by looking at the new eective
quadratic form in (37). this turns out to be a more cumbersome procedure.
we proceed along an alternate route as below.

consider the eect of the net -term in (37) on an axial gauge greens

function:

this is given by the modication sa

e  sa

e  in (38),viz:

hoia = z do[]eisa

e [].

hoia = z do[]eisa

e +io
1.

we now proceed to relate (39) to the corresponding greens functions in
lorentz gauges as done in [12]. we reexpress hoia as:

e []+io

1[]+in o[]|n =0

hoia =


n

1
i



1
n z deisa
i
w a[n]|n =0.

10

now, we consider the quantity:

w a[n]  z deisa
 z deisa

e []f []

e [].{eio

1[]+in o[]}

(41)

we now apply the procedure of [12] (following equation (34) of that work)
to the above expression where o[] there is replaced by the curly bracket
above. then, using identity (53) of [12], we obtain that

w a[n] = z deisl

e []{f [] +xi

i[]

f
i}.

now,

i[]

f
i

f [] +xi
+n(o +xi

= exp(cid:20)i(cid:18)(o1 +x i[]
)(cid:19)(cid:21).

o
i

i[]

(42)

(43)

o1
i

)

in writing (43), we have used the nilpotency of  contained in each of i[]
[see equation (27)]. hence,

w a[n] = z deisl

e []ei([o

1+p i[]

o
1
i

]+n [o+pi i[] o

i

]).

now at n = 0, the above must coincide with w l of (33). hence,

(cid:20)o1 +xi

i[]

o1

i (cid:21) = o1[] = iz d4x(a2/2  cc)

(44)

(45)

now, following the transition from (53) to (54) of [12], we can make a tran-
sition in (41) above. this amounts to substitution of i via (27) and (20).
(here we note that this is possible because the o() terms in (41) are inde-
pendent of ) we then have

hoia = hoil
+z 1

dz dei[sm

0

e [,]ir d4x(a2/2cc)]xi (cid:18)1,i[] + 2,i[](cid:19)[]

o
i

.

(46)

11

thus, while the o() terms needed to be calculated in the greens function
calculation for (38) (viz o1) are very complicated),when hoia is reexpressed
as an integral over , the eect of  terms in this integral is simply to modify
sm [, ]  sm [, ] + ir d4x(a2/2 + cc). thus, the form (46) facilitates
the evaluation of the eect of o() terms on the axial gauge greens functions,
as the modication there is -independent.
we shall now use (46) to write down the expression for the axial gauge

propagator. so we consider:

o[]  a

(x)a

 (y).

(47)

then, with obvious notations

(x  y) = igl 
 (y) + a

(48)

the above is an exact result for the relation between propagators valid to all
orders. for obtaining the correct treatment for the 1/(  q)-singularity, we
are however interested in the tree propagator. for this, we collect the o(g0)
terms on the right-hand side. noting

z dc(x)c(y)ei[sm

[(  1)q2  iq    i]

eir (a2/2cc)d4x] = i g0m (x  y)

in the next section, we shall use the result (50) to obtain the correct

-dependent propagator in the axial gauges.

4 evaluation of the axial gauge propagator

in this section , we shall evaluate the -dependent axial gauge propagator
using (50). we shall show that over most of the real   k axial, we recover
the naive axial gauge propagator. however, we nd a non-trivial complex
structure in a small region near   k = 0. in this section, we shall content
ourselves with the algebraic study of g0a
 . in the next section, we shall study,
in detail, the analytic structure of g0a
 over the complex   k plane.

we express (50), in momentum space as:

we shall now state an important convention in dening the square roots in

(58). the square root y has branch points at r i2[(1i2)3+(1i2+i23)]
and these lie a distance o() away from the origin [for lcg, in the k2 = 0
subspace, however, y = i1 has no branch cut in 1-plane]. we choose
the branch cut joining these. to obtain the value of +y at any point 
not on the branch cut, we consider y for 1 = m as m  +. then
we can ignore  terms in this case and y = q2
1. this, we dene to be
i1. we then dene y for 1 =  by requiring that the phase of y is a
continuous function of m for 1  m < . from this and from the fact that
1), we learn that y (1) = y (1). hence, 2(1) = 1(1).
y  y (2
we further note that this prescription denes uniquely y for real   k 6= 0
since the branch cut cuts the real   k axis only at the origin   k = 0.

we further note that both the kk and the k terms involve an integral

term in (61):

substituted for (60) in (56). hence, we shall study the structure of (62) in
detail. the singularity structure of (62) is dependent on the denominators

and the logarithm. the equation (62), in general reads:

(a1 + )d(1  i1  i2)2

the apparent complexity of (63) actually exists only in the small region of the

the expression (62) can be expressed as

5 singularity structure of the propagator

in this section, we shall study the singularity structure of the propagator
both on the real   k axis as well as the   k complex plane in general. the
singularity structure on the real axis is important from the point of vie w
of the well-dened nature of the propagator for real k while the singularity
structure in the complex  k plane is relevant the question of wick rotation.
as shown in section 4, the quantity (63) is relevant to both the propagator
terms of kk and (k + k) kind. we shall rst analyze its structure.
the singularities of (63) arise from those of p (1) and from those of ln term.
we shall rst analyze the singularities of p (1).
p (1) is a quadratic polynomial in 1 = k

k2+i . it has two zeros; they are:

1 = i(1  i2)  is 1  i2 + 3
1  

,

  k = ik2  is (k2 + 2)(k2 + i)

.

i.e. at

we note that the above roots vanish only when k2 satises:

1  

k4 + k2(2 + i) + i2 = 0.

17

(72)

(73)

(74)

the above equation for k2 = 0 has physical (i.e. real k2) root(s) only in
2 = 0 (except for  = 1). for 2 = 0, it is easily seen that both the roots in
(73) vanish at k2 = 0. we thus note that in the light cone gauge (2 = 0),
the point k2 = 0 needs to be treated with care. we shall rst discuss the
case 2 6= 0.

case i: 2 > 0
(i) k2 > 0: hence, (k2 + 2)k2 > k4 > 0. we may set  = 0. the roots

are:

  k = ik2(cid:20)1 s 1

1  (cid:18)1 +

2

k2(cid:19)(cid:21)

(75)

and lie on imaginary axis on wither side of the real axis at a nite distance
even as   0.

(ii) k2 = 0: the roots are at

  k = is i2
1  

= e

3i

4 s 2
1  

.

(76)

the roots again lie on either side of the real axis at an innitesimal distance
on the line  = 3
4 .

(iii) 0 > k2 > 2: here (k2 + 2)k2 < 0. we can therefore write the

roots as:

  k = ik2 s|(k2 + 2)k2|  i|k2 + 2|

1  

.

(77)

again, we may set  = 0 here. then, the roots

  k = ik2 s|(k2 + 2)k2|

1  

(78)

are on the same side of the real axis, i.e. in the the upper half plane (uhp)
for k2 < 0.

(iv) k2 < 2: here 0 < k2(k2 + 2) < k4. then (setting  = 0), the roots

are at:

  k = i|k2|(cid:20)1 vuut

1

  1(cid:18)1 

2

|k2|(cid:19)(cid:21),

(79)

and both lie in the uhp.

case ii: 2 < 0

18

we express (73) as

  k = i(k2)  is (k2  2)(k2  i)

1  

.

(80)

we note that the above expression is analogous to the rhs of (73) with
2 > 0 and k2  k2,   . hence, a discussion parallel to that given
above applies. we nd:

(i) k2 < 0: the poles are at

  k = i|k2|(cid:20)1 vuut

1

1  (cid:18)1 + |2|
|k2|(cid:19)(cid:21)

(81)

and lie on imaginary axis on wither side of the real axis at a nite distance
even as   0.
(ii) k2 = 0

  k = isi|2|
1  

= e

i

4 s |2|
1  

.

(82)

the roots again lie on either side of the real axis at an innitesimal distance
on the line  = 
4 .

(iii) 0 < k2 < 2: here (k2 + 2)k2 < 0. we can therefore write the

roots as:

  k = ik2 s|(k2 + 2)k2|

1  

(83)

and both lie in the uhp.

(iv) k2 < 2: here 0 < k2(k2 + 2) < k4. then (setting  = 0), the roots

are at:

  k = ik2(cid:20)1 vuut

1

  1(cid:18)1  |2|
|k2|(cid:19)(cid:21),

(84)

and both lie in the lhp.

finally, we consider the important case of the light cone gauge (lcg). it
is this case, where most of the diculties associated with the prescriptions
obtained by others are located.

case iii: 2 = 0 we note that the roots of (73) now read:

  k = ik2  is k4 + ik2
1  

.

19

(85)

for k 6= 0, we can write the roots as:

  k = ik2(cid:20)1 s 1

1  (cid:18)1 + i



k2(cid:19)(cid:21).

(86)

without loss of generality, we may assume that  < |k2| and expand the
square root. the we nd:

  k = ik2(cid:20)1 

1

1   

1

81  

2

k4(cid:21) 



21  

.

(87)

we note that for 0 <  < 1, the roots lie on either side of the real axis. in
particular for small positive , we may set  = 0 and nd:

  k = 2ik2,

ik2

2

.

(88)

on the other hand, we may set  = 0 in the beginning. then we nd it
necessary to take into account the o(2) term in (86). we then nd:

  k = 2ik2,

i
8k2 .

(89)

thus, in either case, the roots are at: (i)   k = 2ik2, and (ii) on imaginary
axis, in uhp for k2 > 0 and lhp for k2 < 0. we note that this discussion
clearly fails for k2 = 0 in the lcg. we then necessarily have to obtain the
treatment for the lcg by a limiting procedure 2  0 for this subspace of
momenta. from (73), for k2 = 0, the roots   k are:

  k = si2
1  

.

(90)

for  6= 0, (irrespective of where 2 > 0 or < 0) these lie on the opposite
sides of the real axis at an innitesimal distance away.

6 eective treatment for the axial propaga-

tor

we obtained an exact -dependent expression for the axial gauge propagator
from its connection to the lorentz gauge greens functions. as remarked

20

earlier, the propagator is eectively the same as the usual one except in a
small region near   k = 0. it is in this region that the many treatments of
the propagator have been suggested, dier. the expression we have obtained
ab initio, however, has complicated structure in this region. we wish to
show that it can be replaced by a much simpler expression which yields the
same (coordinate space) propagator and will facilitate the actual axial gauge
calculations rather than using the expressions of (70) and (71).

we consider the tree axial gauge propagator in coordinate space:

(x  y) = z

(2)3 ei~k(~x~y)z dk0

 (k)

we introduce the variable:

  0k0  ~  ~k.

(91)

(92)

we shall deal with the case 0 6= 0. (this is always possible by a proper
choice of a lorentz frame.) we further assume for simplicity of treatment ,
0 = 1. (this can always by arranged by rescaling  if necessary.) thus, we
use:  = k0  ~  ~k and ~k as integration variables. we express
(x  y) = z
ei(x0y0)g0a

can, in the limit   0, be eectively replaced by two terms: (i) one of which
is

ei(x0y0)g0a

,e(, ~k)

(95)

where g0a
,e has a simple structure near  = 0 and the contour c is a contour
suitably distorted near  = 0 as will be specied soon, (ii) and a contribution
having a relatively simple form arising from the region near  = 0.

21

to achieve this, we replace,

z 



= zc

d +ic1

d

(96)

where c runs from (,) and (,) and is completed by adding
a semicircle of radius  in the lhp. contour c1 on the other hand is a
closed contour to compensate[c for the left hand side (see fig 1). here
 is a (large enough) arbitrary positive number. we then show that (i) on
 (, ~k), the -dependence can, in fact, be ignored and be replaced by
c, g0a
the naive axial propagator (with  complex over the semicircle); (ii) the
contour c1 can be shrunk so that the contribution over c1 can be replaced

by that around the branch cut (from ii2 to ii2) which will then be
evaluated (see fig. 2). this contribution, in the limit   0, can be replaced
by a simple expression as shown later.
[here, we clarify the location of the contour on the left hand side of (96).

we recall that in (70), the ln factor:

ln(cid:18)

 + 

 2 + i2(cid:19).

(97)

is in principle, multi-valued. however, this factor, has arisen out of the
expression (62) whose value is unambiguous in in the original complex inte-
gral[c (60). in particular, we have already dened  2 + i2 earlier for
|| >> , the factor boils down to
ln(cid:18) 

i(cid:19) = i

(98)


2

.

in the region ||  , we must dene the phase of the logarithm recalling
that it has arisen from the unambiguous integrals

0

z 1

  a1
d

= ln(cid:18) 1  a1
a1 (cid:19)
= ln(cid:18) 1  1
1 (cid:19).

(99)

(100)

this denes the way the contour on the left hand side of (96) should be
drawn near  = 0, .]

22

in this work, we shall only deal with the case 2 6= 0 and consider the
propagator for k2 6= 0. we may then choose  << |k2|, in which case we
may replace k2/(k2 + i) by 1 wherever possible. we shall also set  = 0for
simplicity. [in the case of lcg, we may need to keep  6= 0 till the end; we
shall not deal with this here however.]
on the contour c, we have || >> 2 for suciently large . here we

can employ the treatment in appendices b and c to conclude that the prop-
agator over c can be replaced by the naive axial propagator (with complex
):

g0a
 (k,  = 0) =

k2(cid:18)g +

(k2 + 2)

(  k)2 kk 

k[]+

  k (cid:19).

(101)

we recall from the discussion of section 4, that for k2 6= 0, 2 6= 0, the
singularities of p (1) are at a nite distance away from  = 0. hence c1
does not enclose these. we however, have the branch cut dened earlier (see
discussion following (59)) and ones arising from the presence of the logarithm.
we shrink the contour c1 so that it in eect goes around the branch cut in
the lhp, and receives a contribution proportional to the discontinuity in
ln( 2 + i2) across the branch cut.

we summarize the procedure followed for evaluating the eective replace-

ment. we express

we then evaluate

(109)

in the treatment we have given in this section, we have found it necessary
to keep 2 nonzero in the intermediate stages. we can, however, dene the
lcg as a limit of the nal result as 2  0. the procedure, here, is very
analogous to the one we had to adopt in appendix a, where we found it
necessary to keep 2 nonzero in the intermediate stages of calculations. we
need, however, take this limit keeping  nonzero. we nd, by taking the limit
2  0 in (107)-(109), that these extra terms vanish for lcg. this result
can also be seen ab intio by looking at the contour integral over c1. here we
note that the width of the branch cut shrinks as 2  0. this together with
the fact that [for  nonzero] the discontinuity is nite for 2 = 0, leads to the
above result.

7 conclusion

in this work, we have dealt with the question of the treatment of 1/(  k)p-
type singularities in the axial/lcg gauges in an ab-initio manner. we have
used the known treatment in the lorentz gauges and connection between

25

lorentz and axial gauges to achieve this. we have used the results established
earlier on the ffbrs transformation that connect greens functions in these
two gauges. we evaluated an -dependent propagator in axial gauges via this
procedure. we have suggested that this should give the correct way to deal
with the 1/(  k)p-type singularities in the axial propagator.
we nd that this propagator, not surprisingly, coincides with the usual
axial propagator except in a small region around   k = 0, the propagator
does not show spurious poles at   k = 0. it is however complicated but
predetermined in form in a small region near   k = 0. we have shown
however that there is a way of eectively replacing this complicated structure
of the propagator by a much simpler expression. we believe, this is a rst
ab-initio treatment of axial gauge poles in the path-integral formalism.

as mentioned in the introducton and elaborated in [15], the prescription

obtained here also preserves the value of the wilson loop.

a

in this appendix, we shall give the complete treatment for the second term
in (61). in particular, we shall show that the contribution from this term
vanishes as   0.

  0 f (  k 6= 0, k2 6= 0, 2,  = 0, ) = 0.

(a7)

next, we treat the case k2 = 0. here: (i) i2 = 0; 1 = i k
 ;

27

(ii)  = 0;  =
(iii) the denominator of (a6) simplies to

(k)2+i2 ;

2

[i12  1][i11  1] = 2

1 + 2i1q2   + 1

counting only the powers of :

[i12  1][i11  1]  o(0);
q2    o(),  6= 0;
ln(cid:20) 2  12

f (  k 6= 0, k2 = 0, 2,  6= 0, ) = 0()

lim

  0 f (  k 6= 0, k2 = 0, 2,  6= 0, ) = 0.

then:

and we nd:

(a8)

(a9)

(a10)

(a11)

we thereafter set  = 0.

finally, we shall deal with the subspace k2 =   k = 0. here, we note
that 2 6= is necessary to begin with for the procedure to be dened in the
intermediate stages. then:

[i12  1][i11  1]  o(0);
 = 0;  =

1 = 2 = q = q2    os 
2 ;
ln(cid:20) 2  12

1 + i23  o(
1  i2 + 2
(numerator :)  i  o(0)


2 ),   k 6= 0

28

(a12)

thus,

f (  k 6= 0, k2 = 0, 2 6= 0,  6= 0, ) = o(s
2 ).

thus we may set  = 0. then

f (  k 6= 0, k2 = 0, 2 6= 0,  = 0, ) = 0.

(a13)

(a14)

we may then set 2 = 0 at the end for lcg though 2 6= 0 is needed for the
procedure to be well dened.
one can show that a similar analysis holds good for the contribution of

(a1) to the k terms in (56).

b

in this appendix, we shall consider the expression of the rst term in (61)
involving

(b3)

(b4)

and higher order terms neglected as   0 if the expansion parameter

1  a1
a1(1  1)  0 as   0.

in this appendix, we shall seek the domains of validity of (b2) and (b4).

we divide out (b2) by |1||a1| (valid except where |1| and |a1| vanish).

the equation (b2) then translates as:

1

a1| < |

29

(b5)

1

a1  1

ln(cid:20) 1  a11
a1  a11(cid:21)

which can be expanded in a taylor series in powers of
dened by:

|1  a1| < |a1(1  1)|.
further, the expression (b1) could be truncated as:



1

a1(1  1)

+ o(a1  1)

this simplies to

(b7)

(b8)

we analyze the condition (b7) at  = 0, which is sucient. the equation

(b7) then comes:

im(cid:20)s k2 + i

k2 q(  k)2  i2

  k + 

(cid:21) >

2

.

(b9)

for |  k| >>  and |k2| >> , it is evident that the left hand side is (using
the convention for the square root as given below (59))

im(cid:20) i  k

  k + (cid:21)  1 >

1
2

(b10)

and thus (b9) is automatically satised in fact, for   k  0+ also, (noting
that the phase of q(  k)2  i2 varies continuously from 
2 as   k  0+
from large values) (b9) reads, for 2 6= 0,
(cid:21) =

im(cid:20)
and is automatically > 1
2 for  suciently small. also a shift of variables
  k +  = , will allow one to concluded in a similar manner that for
  0+(i.e.  k +   0)the condition (b9) is fullled for 2 6= 0. a careful
analysis of (b9) in fact shows that (b9) is satised for 2 6= 0 and real   k
everywhere on the real   k axis except the interval (, 0). for 2 = 0,

(b14)

similarly, (b9) is valid over the real  k axis except the interval (, ). this
is valid for any k2.
next, we analyze the condition (b4) required, in addition, for the trun-
cation of the expansion (b3). the condition (b4), in notations below (b5)
reads:

the condition (b12) can be analyzed at  = 0. it then reads:

for k2 6= 0, and xed (k)2 6= 0, we can , in fact, by taking  arbitrarily small,
make the left-hand side of (b13) arbitrarily small. thus, the conditions for
the validity of the expansion of (b1) and its truncation of (b3) hold valid
for any real   k outside the interval (, 0) for 2 6= 0 and (, ) for 2 = 0
provided k2 6= 0. the above analysis of (b13) however fails at k2 = 0.
we nd that for k2 = 0, while the condition (b7) is satised in the domain
mentioned, the condition (b12) is not satised. so, in this domain, we may
not use the truncated expression for (b1).

c

in this appendix, we shall carry out the check that the propagator (56), via
expression (62), in fact leads to the naive propagator at  = 0.

as noted in appendix a, the contribution of the second term in (62),
vanishes at  = 0. we shall now evaluate the contribution of the rst term
in (62). as noted in (68), this term reduces to:

1

a1  2

 + a1
a1  1

ln(cid:20) 1  a12

a1  a11(cid:21) = 

(a1 + )(1  i1)2(1 + 2

(1 = k

k2 at  = 0). then the right-hand side of (56) at  = 0 reads:

a straightforward simplication then leads to the familiar result (69).

by using the identity

(c3)

one can show that the  = 0 limit of (70) also gives (69).
