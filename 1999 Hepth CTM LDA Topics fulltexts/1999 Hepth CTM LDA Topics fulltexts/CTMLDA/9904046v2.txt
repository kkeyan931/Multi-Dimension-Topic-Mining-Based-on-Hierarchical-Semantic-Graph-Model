abstract

in this work we consider a coupled system of schwinger-dyson equations for self-energy
and vertex functions in qed3. using the concept of a semi-amputated vertex function, we
manage to decouple the vertex equation and transform it in the infrared into a non-linear
dierential equation of emden-fowler type. its solution suggests the following picture:
in the absence of infrared cut-os there is only a trivial infrared xed-point structure in
the theory. however, the presence of masses, for either fermions or photons, changes the
situation drastically, leading to a mass-dependent non-trivial infrared xed point. in this
picture a dynamical mass for the fermions is found to be generated consistently. the
non-linearity of the equations gives rise to highly non-trivial constraints among the mass
and eective (running) gauge coupling, which impose lower and upper bounds on the
latter for dynamical mass generation to occur. possible implications of this to the theory
of high-temperature superconductivity are briey discussed.

1 introduction

three-dimensional quantum electrodynamics (qed3), with an even number of
fermion avours, apart from serving as a toy model for studying chiral-symmetry
breaking and connement, also constitutes a physically interesting theory per se,
in view of its possible applications in modelling novel (high-temperature) supercon-
ductors [1]-[4].

chiral symmetry breaking or, equivalently, dynamical mass generation for fermions,

in even-avour qed3 has still many unresolved issues. one of those is the exis-
tence of a (dimensionless) critical coupling, above which dynamical mass generation
for the fermions occurs [5]. in the context of large-n treatment, which at present
constitutes the only well-studied approach, the role of the dimensionless coupling 1
is played by the inverse of the fermion avour number n. the issue of the exis-
tence of a critical coupling in qed3 is a delicate one [6]. many of the original
approximations [5] leading to its existence have been questioned, in particular the
fact that wave-function renormalization eects have not been properly accounted
for. recently, however, the incorporation of such eects, still within the large -n
context, appears to corroborate [7]-[9] the qualitative picture advocated in [5]. in
addition, the latter is also supported by lattice simulations [10].

nonetheless, the situation is far from being conclusive. the fact that the critical
n, below which dynamical mass generation occurs, is found to be of order 3 (in a
four-component notation for the fermions) provides motivation for searches beyond
the large-n treatment. moreover, up to now the gauge coupling in the infrared has
been treated as an arbitrary parameter, whose size has not been restricted by an ad-
ditional dynamical constraint. at present we are lacking a self-consistent treatment
of the dynamical schwinger-dyson (sd) equations involving the vertex function on
an equal footing with the self-energy and gap functions. in all the approaches so far,
at least within the large n treatment that we are aware of, one invokes a specic
ansatz for the vertex, by the sole requirement of satisfying some truncated form
of the ward-takahashi identity stemming from gauge invariance [8]-[11]. the lack
of dynamical information for the coupling poses problems; for instance, its size in
the infrared is treated as an arbitrary parameter, being assumed to merely exceed
a critical value, if one wishes to trigger chiral symmetry breaking.

another point, related to the above, which is already familiar from studies in
the case of four-dimensional non-abelian gauge theories, is whether chiral-symmetry
breaking is associated with connement of charges [12]. this issue acquires physical
importance in view of the condensed-matter applications. in particular, it may shed
more light in the dynamics of spin-charge separation, by analogy with the physics
of strong interactions [13].

in this work we shall not deal with issues of connement, which exists in qed3

1in three dimensions the coupling e2 has dimensions of mass. one can still dene, however,
dimensionless couplings by dividing with a dynamically generated scale, which in the large n -
treatment arises by demanding that [5] e2n = 8, with the scale  kept xed as n  . the
dimensionless coupling is then dened as the ratio e2/8 = 1/n .

despite its abelian nature.
instead, we shall attempt a novel approach to chiral
symmetry breaking, independently of a large n treatment, by studying the coupled
fermion and photon self-energies and vertex sd equations in the context of a method
rst introduced for the case of four-dimensional qcd [14]. the novel ingredient is
that we concentrate on the semi-amputated vertex, dened in section 2, which is
the correct gauge-invariant quantity to determine a physically meaningful running
coupling (eective charge). the fact that qed3 is superrenormalizable in the
ultraviolet does not preclude the possibility of dening such a quantity, having non-
trivial structure in the infrared. as we show in sections 2 and 3, the existence of a
non-trivial infrared xed point is a property only of the infrared-regularized theory,
as conjectured in [11]. in other words, in the absence of fermion (or photon) masses,
the infrared singularities of the vertex equation will force the eective charge to
vanish at zero momentum transfer, thereby excluding the possibility of an interesting
infrared behaviour. from a condensed-matter application point of view this would
correspond to what is usually called the landau-fermi liquid theory (trivial infrared
xed point) [15, 11]. in the presence of masses, and in particular fermion masses, we
show in section 3 that there is a non-trivial infrared xed point structure, stemming
from the fact that the eective charge obtained as a self-consistent solution of the
non-linear vertex sd equation, is driven to a nite positive value, which can be large
enough to trigger dynamical generation of a fermion mass. this implies that the
phenomenon of chiral symmetry breaking is intimately associated with deviations
from the trivial infrared xed-point structure.

we should stress that, as a result of the non-linearity of the vertex equation, there
are delicate constraints between the fermion mass and the eective charge, which are
responsible for the appearance of regions of the latter for which dynamical genera-
tions occurs. at present, these restrictions appear as a consequence of mathematical
self-consistency of the truncated equations. it is not clear to us, whether the up-
per bounds on the eective charge, imposed by the present cubic approximations
for the vertex corrections, will survive the inclusion of higher orders. in contrast,
we believe that the lower bounds will survive such a treatment, thereby indicating
the existence of a critical coupling above which dynamical mass generation will oc-
cur. this is physically appealing, given that one would not expect a weakly-coupled
theory to be capable of breaking dynamically chiral symmetry.

the layout of this article is as follows:

in section 2 we set up the sd equa-
tions that we wish to study, and discuss in detail the approximations employed.
we demonstrate that, under certain assumptions to be justied retrospectively in
section 4, the equation for the semi-amputated vertex decouples from the rest, and
hence can be solved separately. moreover, we establish the absence of a non-trivial
infrared xed point rigorously (within the cubic approximation for the vertex), by
casting the sd equation for the eective charge in a form of a non-linear dier-
ential equation, known as emden-fowler equation [16, 17]. in section 3 we study
the equation for the vertex in the presence of a fermion mass, acting as an infrared
regulator. we derive the appropriate non-linear dierential equation describing the
infrared behaviour of the running coupling, and solve it to demonstrate the ex-

istence of a non-trivial infrared xed point. the so-derived running charge is a
monotonically decreasing function of the momentum, tending asymptotically to a
constant positive value in the ultraviolet. in section 4, we solve the equations for
the photon and fermion self-energies, which in our approximations decouple from
each other and depend only on the semi-amputated vertex function. we then verify
the self-consistency of the approach. in section 5 we examine the self-consistency of
the dynamical generation of the fermion mass, by solving the appropriate sd equa-
tion upon substituting the solution for the semi-amputated vertex found in previous
sections. the self-consistency of the approach restricts the allowed regions of the
eective charge, implying the existence of a lower bound (critical coupling) but also
of an upper one. in section 6, we examine an alternative type of infrared cut-o,
namely that of a (bare) covariant photon mass term. this case also exhibits a non-
trivial infrared xed-point structure but, in contrast to the monotonic decrease of
the eective charge in the case of fermion masses, here the coupling initially increases
in the infrared, then displays a local maximum, and eventually decreases, tending
asymptotically to a constant value in the ultraviolet. some possible applications of
this behaviour, inspired by condensed-matter physics, are briey discussed. finally,
in section 7 we present our conclusions and outlook.

2 the sd equation for the semi-amputated ver-

tex

in this section we will rst set up the sd equations for the photon and electron self-
energies, and the photon-electron vertex; then we will dene the semi-amputated
vertex and derive its corresponding sd equation. as we will explain, the latter
governs the behaviour of the eective coupling in the infra-red. the derivation of
the sd equations for the photon propagator , the electron propagator sf , and
the photon-electron vertex  proceeds following standard methods [18, 19] (see
gures 1,2,3).

the full photon propagator , its inverse 1

 , and the full vacuum polarisation

 in euclidean space are related by

the innite set of terms containing the two-particle irreducible four-point function
[18, 19]. although we are not working in the context of a large n analysis, we note
that the above truncation is compatible with working to leading order in resummed
1/n expansion.

(2.7)

the quantity b is related to  dened in (2.1) by b(q) = 1 + (q). the denition
in (2.6) implies that the longitudinal pieces of the photon propagator will be dis-
carded in what follows. of course, there are no rigorous eld-theoretic arguments
justifying their omission or inclusion. the correct treatment of such terms neces-
sitates a formalism which would allow for the self-consistent truncation of the sd
series in a manifestly gauge-invariant way; unfortunately, no such formalism exists
to date. the standard lore when writing down sd equations is to use in (2.3) the
form of  given in (2.1), setting  = 0 (landau gauge). while in qed4 this
choice renders the vertex corrections unimportant in the ultraviolet, it appears to
be less compelling in the context of the superrenormalizable qed3. in addition,
it is known that, while the conventionally dened fermion self-energy and photon-
fermion vertex depend explicitly on the gauge-xing parameter , it is possible to
construct at least at one-loop  a -independent fermion self-energy and vertex, by
resorting to the diagrammatic rearrangement of the s-matrix known as the pinch
technique [20]. it turns out that the -independent fermion self-energy and vertex
so constructed coincide with their conventional counterparts, if we choose for the
latter the special value  = 1 (feynmann-t hooft gauge) [21]. furthermore, as has
been formally shown in [22], all longitudinal pieces appearing in (2.1) vanish from
physical observables, such as s-matrix elements, to all orders in perturbation theory.
thus, one is led to a generalized form of the feynman-t hooft gauge, known as the
stagnant gauge, where only the  part of the vacuum polarization contributes,
to all orders in perturbation theory. this gauge will be adopted throughout the
present article.

following [14] and [19] we dene the semi-amputated vertex g as

with

g(p1, p2, p3)  z(p1, p2, p3)g(p1, p2, p3)

z(p1, p2, p3) = b1/2(p1)a1/2(p2)a1/2(p3)

(2.8)

(2.9)

this denition proves very useful in reducing the complexity of the set of equa-
tions (2.3)-(2.4), under certain approximations to be discussed in detail in the next
sections. in addition, the quantity

gr(p1, p2, p3)  e g(p1, p2, p3)

(2.10)

provides a natural generalization of the concept of the running or eective charge in
the context of superrenormalizable gauge theories [23], such as qed3. this running
of the coupling should be understood as a wilsonian rather than gell-mann-low
type, in the sense that it is not associated with ultraviolet innities; instead, it
expresses a non-trivial infrared structure of the theory [11].

note that in four-dimensional qed (qed4) the eective charge e2

e is dened

in terms of the photon vacuum polarisation as:

e2
e(q2) = e2[1 + (q2)]1,

(2.11)

and is a gauge-, scale-, and scheme-independent quantity [24] to all orders in pertur-
e depends explicitly on q2 and the masses of the fermions inside the
bation theory. e2
vacuum polarisation loop. in the limit where the fermion masses can be neglected,
e2
e(q2) coincides with the running coupling obtained by the  function of qed4, i.e.
the solution of the usual renormalization-group dierential equation. an advantage
of the denition given in (2.10) is that it captures the running coupling even in the
case of scalar theories [19], where, due to the absence of ward-takahashi identities,
the role of the gauge boson self-energies is not as prominent as in gauge theories.
as we shall see in section 5, the interpretation of gr dened in (2.10) as a running
coupling is also justied by the form of the sd for the fermion mass gap.

the equation for the semi-amputated vertex g may be obtained from (2.4) by

multiplying both sides by the factor z(p1, p2, p3), i.e.

g(p1, p2, p3) = z(p1, p2, p3)  e2z

(2.12)

(2.13)

in what follows we shall restrict ourselves to the case where the photon momentum
is vanishingly small, and thus one is left with a single momentum scale p. one can
then dene a renormalization-group  function from this running coupling g(p)
by setting

  p

g(p)

(2.14)

in order to further simplify the sd equation for g(p) we make the additional approx-
imation that g3 = g3(k), i.e. a cubic power of a single g(k) depending only on the
integration variable k. this approximation will be justied by the self-consistency
of the solutions.

carrying out the gamma-matrix algebra using the formulae  = d, and
 = (d  2) valid for 4 4 gamma matrices in d(= 3)-dimensional euclidean
space, one obtains in a straightforward manner:

g(p) = z(p) +

(k  p)2

(2.15)

several remarks are now in order. first, one observes that z(p)  1 for p  ,
where perturbation theory is valid. this is inferred from the fact that in such a case,
as can be readily veried, the functions a(p), b(p)  1 + o(e2/p). in addition, in
the ultraviolet region, p  , gauge invariance requires g(p)  a(p). second,
from (2.15) one observes that, if g stays positive, which is expected for any physical
theory, then, as a result of the positivity of the integrand, g(p)  z(p) for any p.
thus, one has the following basic properties of g(p), which stem directly from the
integral equation (2.15):

g(p)  z(p), for all p,

;

g(p)  b1/2(p)  1,

p  

(2.16)

notice that g(p) in the ultraviolet is thereby given by (1 + (p))1/2 as in qed4.
this is the perturbative result, which, as we shall see later, is modied non-trivially
in the infrared, in a way consistent with gauge invariance. moreover, as we shall
see later, the self-consistency of the approximations employed will require g(0) >>

q3/2.

our next assumption is that in the infrared regime, k/ << 1, which is of
interest to us here, the eects of the inhomogeneous term z(p) can be ignored. this
assumption will be justied later on, when we consider a non-trivial self-consistency
check of the solutions. we now remark that by ignoring the eects of z(p) one can
decouple the equation for the (gauge-invariant) amputated vertex from the equations
for a(p),b(p). as we shall discuss in subsequent sections, these latter equations also
decouple from each other, depending only on the vertex function g(p).

because of this, we commence our analysis from the sd equation for the vertex
g(p), which we solve upon ignoring the eects of the inhomogeneous z(p) term.
thus we arrive at the homogeneous equation

g(p) =

1
3

e2z

(2)3

g3(k)

(k  p)2

(2.17)

this integral equation involves only one unknown function, namely g, which must be
self-consistently determined. note that this equation is invariant under the rescaling
g  g/e. this indicates a straightforward extension of the analysis to a large-n
treatment, given that n can be absorbed in a redenition of e2.
it is easy to see that, written in the form (2.17), the equation does not admit
physically acceptable solutions, i.e. solutions with g  0 and nite 2. indeed, setting
p = 0 one obtains after the (trivial) angular integration 3:

g(0) =

e2

122 z 

0

dk
k2

g3(k)

(2.18)

2solutions that blow up in any point of the integration region are discarded.
3these arguments remain unaected even in the presence of an inhomogeneous term z(p), such
that z(0) is non-negative and nite. the non-negative nature of z(p) (2.9) stems from that of
a(p), which is guaranteed from general renormalization-group arguments [25].

finiteness of g(0) requires that the integrand of the right hand side of (2.18) con-
verges at y  0 and . the ultaviolet limit does not present a problem, because
the kernel vanishes like y2, which is consistent with the superrenormalizability of
the theory as well as the fact that the amputated vertex tends to 1. in the infrared
limit y  0, however, the kernel blows up. for the integral to remain nite at that
point, as required by the niteness assumption for g(0), g3(y) must approach zero
as y,  > 1/3, thereby implying that g(0) = 0. however for that to happen the
integrand in (2.18) must change sign, which would in turn imply that g(y) itself
must change sign somewhere in y. according to our assumption above this is not a
physically acceptable situation.

to show rigorously that there are no physically acceptable solutions leading to a
non-trivial infrared structure we next convert the integral equation into a non-linear
dierential equation of the type known in the mathematical literature as emden-
fowler equation [16, 17]. to this end, we perform the angular integration in (2.17),
to arrive at the equation:

g(p) =

(2.19)

where we have set e2  8 to make contact with the usual large-n denition [5]. for
us, however, the number of fermion avours is not assumed to be necessarily large.
in fact, for brevity we set n = 1 (in a four-component notation for the fermions)
throughout this work. next we introduce the dimensionless variables x  p/
and y  k/. since we are interested in the infrared behaviour of the model we
consider the limit x << 1, for which one obtains by expanding the logarithms in
the integrand:

upon the change of variables  = 1
emden-fowler type [16, 17]:

2x2 , g = 23/4 (), the equation becomes of

d2
d2 () + 3/23() = 0,

  +

(2.24)

as discussed in the mathematical literature [16], the only non-trivial real solutions
of (2.24), as   +, are oscillatory about zero of simple sinusoidal form, which
however oscillate innitely rapidly as x  0. the amplitude of the above solutions
behaves like x1/2, for x << 1. we interprete this behaviour as indicating an
instability of the massless-fermion ground state.

it is interesting to notice that the only power-law solution of (2.23) for x << 1,

is purely imaginary, i.e.

g(x) = i

5
2

x1/2,

x << 1

(2.25)

this solution would imply a trivial infrared xed point structure given that its
associated  function vanishes at x = 0. however, the fact that (2.25) is purely
imaginary would again suggest instability.

the above analysis constitutes a rigorous proof that, within the context of proper
(i.e. nite and with nite-derivatives) solutions, and modulo the approximations
discussed, no non-trivial infrared-xed point is possible in qed3 in the absence of
an infrared cut-o. this was conjectured in ref.
[11], but here we have given an
analytic proof. this motivates one to look for the existence of a possible non-trivial
infrared xed-point structure in the presence of fermion and/or photon masses. in
the next section we shall discuss the case when the fermions develop a mass m. as
we shall show, the existence of a non-trivial infrared xed point is guaranteed due
to the form of the resulting equations.

3 equation for the vertex in the case of non-zero

fermion mass

as a rst kind of infrared cut-o in the integral equation (2.17) we shall consider
the case of a fermion mass gap m(p) = (p)
a(p), where (p) is the fermion self energy.
in that case the fermion propagator sf becomes:

sf (k) =

i

a(k) (/k + mf (k))

(3.1)

for our purposes below we assume that mf (p)  mf (0)  mf 6= 0. in that case the
integral equation (2.17) becomes:

g(p) =

notice that the eects of the fermion mass are not given simply by just adding
a mass squared term in the fermion denominators, but they result in additional
structures in the integral equation.

performing the angular integrations one arrives at:

g(x) =

(3.5)

one observes that formally as x  0 the right-hand-side vanishes, provided that
g is nite. this indicates the existence of a xed point. as we shall show below
this is conrmed analytically by converting the integral equation into a non-linear
dierential equation.

an additional feature which one would have hoped to study already at the level
of the integral equation (3.5) is the monotonicity of g. unfortunately the kernel
in (3.5) is not manifestly positive to allow for such an analytic proof at the level
of the integral equation for generic values of x, and one has to resort to numerical
treatments, which fall beyond the scope of this article. however one can already
infer from (3.5) that, for high momenta x >> 1, a monotonically decreasing g
is consistent with the expectation that in this regime g is essentially given by its
perturbative expression which asymptotes to 1. the analysis is omitted because it
is straightforward.

for low momenta, on the other hand, the behaviour of g(x) will also be shown
to be monotonically decreasing, starting from a non trivial xed point. this will be
achieved by converting the integral equation into a dierential one. unfortunately, at
present, we cannot analytically derive the monotonicity for intermediate momenta.
to derive the dierential equation from (3.3) we follow a similar analysis to the
one leading to (2.20). first, one expands the logarithms for small x << 1, thereby
writing the equation as:

the above equation can be solved numerically, to which we will come later on.
however, in the infrared region x << m the equation accepts an analytic treatment,
as we discuss below. in this region the equation (3.7) is approximated by:

notice the infrared divergence of this type of solutions even in the presence of a
(bare) fermion mass. the associated renormalization-group  function (2.14) for
this case reads:

(3.10)

indicating the absence of an infrared xed point. the associated operator appears
to be relevant (negative scaling dimension), which implies the possibility that the
theory be driven to a non-trivial xed point.

however, in the infrared regime x << 1, one can nd a dierent type of solu-

tion [16]:

g = m

(3.11)

where c is a constant of integration to be xed by the boundary condition at x = 0
implied by the integral equation, to be discussed later on. for physical solutions c
is assumed positive.

this type of solutions has a renormalization-group -function (2.14) of the form:

 =  g(x) +

(1 + c2x)2  0,

x  0

(3.12)

from which we observe the existence of a non-trivial (non-perturbative) infrared
xed point at g = m3c
> 0. such a xed point is the result of the dynamical
22
generation of a parity-invariant, chiral-symmetry breaking fermion mass [5], indi-
cating the connection of the phenomenon of chiral symmetry breaking in qed3 to
a non-trivial infrared xed point structure, in agreement with the expectations of
ref. [11].

the non-trivial xed-point solution (3.11) is not compatible with the integral
equation (3.2) for any value of the fermion mass m. indeed one can derive a boundary
condition for g(0) from (3.2), which reads:

g(0) =

(3.13)

in contrast to the massless case (2.18), g(0) is now a nite constant, mcq3/8,
as seen from (3.11), and this allows for a compatibility of the solution (3.11) with
(3.13), provided that m g(0) satises certain conditions to be specied below.

to this end, we split the y-integration in (3.13) into two intervals: (i) y  [0, m),
where the form (3.11) is valid to a good approximation, and (ii) y  [m,), where
we approximate g(x) by its perturbative asymptotic value g  1. by this latter
approximation we overestimate the actual value of the integration, given that g is
actually slightly smaller than unity for nite p, approaching it only asymptotically
(c.f. (2.16)). however, this is sucient for our qualitative purposes of demonstrating
the existence of constraints on the fermion mass implied by the boundary condition
(3.13).

with these in mind, the boundary condition (3.13) reduces to:

to obtain the condition imposed on m by the boundary condition (3.13) it suces
to observe that the rst term on the right-hand-side is a function of mc2 alone, and
that, after the (elementary) y integration, the resulting function of mc2 asymptotes
rapidly to the value 3/4 (see gure 4).

this implies the following inequality:

we next remark that m should actually be determined self-consistently from a
solution of the pertinent gap equation. this will be done in section 5. however,

at the moment, and for completeness, we shall assume that m is determined by its
approximate form derived within the context of a large-n treatment [5, 1]. compat-
ibility of the dynamical solution with the constraint (3.15) will then lead to further
restrictions on the range of the allowed masses m. as we shall see in section 5, there
is good agreement between the allowed fermion-mass ranges, obtained within the
context of a large-n treatment, and those obtained from a self-consistent solution
of the mass gap equation within our approach.

in the context of a large n treatment, and to leading order in 1/n resummation,

the following solution for the dynamically-generated m is found [5, 1],

m  o(1)exp

g2

(3.16)

c = 2

where g2
32 is the critical coupling, above which dynamical mass generation
occurs [5]. compatibility of the solution (3.16) with the constraint (3.15) implies
the existence of an upper bound on fermion masses, m < mmax, where mmax is
dened through the intersection of the curves (3.15) and (3.16) in the (m, g) plane
(see g. 5). this yields mmax  0.3.

figure 5: fermion mass versus the infrared-value of the coupling g(0). the solid
curve represents the condition derived from the integral equation for the vertex,
whereas the dashed line represents the solution obtained from the standard gap equa-
tion in the large-n treatment.

on the other hand, for large momenta, we know that g  1. physically one
expects a monotonic decrease of g(x) over the entire range of x  [0,). this
would occur in our case if and only if g(0) > 1, which, in the context of the large-n
result of [5, 1], implies a minimum bound for the fermion masses m > mmin  0.03.
actually, as we shall argue in the next section, g(0) should be comfortably larger
than q3/2 for self-consistency of our approximations.

hence, we see that the monotonicity of the running coupling can be achieved in

the context of a large-n treatment, if the mass m lies in the following regime:

0.03 < m < 0.3

(3.17)

or equivalently if the coupling at the infrared point g(0) is restricted in the regime
(see g. 4):

1 < g(0) < 2.5,

(3.18)

at this point it is useful to turn to a numerical study of the equation (3.7), supple-
mented with the boundary conditions imposed by the solutions of the form (3.11),
specically:

g(0) = m



2s 3

c

;

g(0) = 

8 g3(0)

(3.19)

where the constant c should be chosen in such a way that the bound (3.15) be
satised. the numerical solution of (3.7) is given in gure 6, for a typical case,
where m = 0.1, and g(0) = 2. as we observe, the gure clearly demonstrates the
monotonic decrease of g in the small x interval, where equation (3.7) is valid. we
also note that the solution asymptotes quickly to a constant positive value, smaller
than 1 in contrast to (2.16), which would require g(x)  1, for x >> 1. this,
however, presents no contradiction, because equation (3.7) was based on ignoring
the inhomogeneous term z(x). as one goes to a region of larger x, this assumption
is no longer valid. in that case the inhomogeneous term z(x) becomes important,
and equation (3.7) receives additive (positive) contributions, resulting in g(p)  1,
for large p, as required by (2.16).

4 equations for photon and fermion self-energies

as a consistency check of our assumption about ignoring the eects of the inhomo-
geneous term z(p) as p  0, next to g, we now turn our attention to the equations
that determine the fermion and photon self-energies a(p) and b(p) respectively. as
shown below, upon neglecting z(p) in the infrared, these equations decouple from

each other and both functions can be determined solely from knowledge of g(x).
it should also be stressed that in the massless case the system does not admit a
self-consistent solution. in contrast, the presence a fermion mass term changes the
situation drastically by yielding self-consistent solutions for a(p), b(p) which are

such that z(p)  36/5, but at a rate slower than the one with which g ap-
proaches g(0) as x  0. thus the approximation of ignoring the eects of z(x) in
the region x << 1 is qualitatively correct. this is a highly non-trivial check of our
approach, and justies fully the approximations used above.

to this end, we begin from the integral equation for a(x), which reads:

a(p) /p = /p  e2z

d3k
(2)3g2(k)

i

a(k)/k





b(k  p)(k  p)2

which in terms of the semi-amputated vertex g becomes:

a(p) /p = /p  e2a(p)z

d3k
(2)3

g2(k)

/k

k2(k  p)2

(4.1)

(4.2)

to arrive at the above equation we have carried out the -matrix algebra and we
have used the approximation that g(k, p) = g(k). this approximation is equivalent
to the one made for g in (2.12). it will be justied below, by the self-consistency of
the solution.

in terms of the dimensionless x, m parameters introduced previously, the equa-

tion (4.2) becomes:

x2 + m2 = 0

(4.4)

restricting our attention to the infrared region x  0, one may ignore x2 in front of
m2, and use the form (3.11) for g(x). after elementary integrations one then nds
for a(x)1:

a1(x) =

where c > 0 is the integration constant of the solution (3.11), which obeys the

(4.6)

as x  0. as we shall show later, this choice is compatible with the boundary
behaviour z(x)  const, as x  0, advocated for the inhomogeneous term.
next we turn our attention to the equation for the photon function b(p), in the
presence of a fermion mass. following similar steps to the ones leading to (4.2), the
pertinent integral equation reads:

b(p)(cid:16)p2  pp(cid:17) = p2  pp + b(p)e2z

d3k
(2)3

g2(k)tr"

/k
k2 

(k  p)2#
/k  /p

(4.7)
to trasnform the above equation into a scalar equation for b(p) it is necessary to
take the trace on both sides.
in doing so one assumes that the integral term on
the right-hand-side is also transverse. this is expected from gauge invariance. in
our truncated scheme it can be demonstrated that this is indeed the case, provided
one makes our working hypothesis that g(k, p) = g(k). specically if one contracts
both sides of (4.7) by p, the right-hand-side vanishes (ward identity for the photon)
only upon making the above assumption for the semi-amputated vertex, and shifting
appropriately the integration variable.

after standard manipulations, similar to the ones above, one arrives at:

making the same approximations in the infrared x << 1 as in the case of a(x), and
substituting the emdens solution (3.11) for g on the right-hand-side of (4.8), we
obtain after some elementary integrations, upon setting their constants but one (c1)
to zero:

(4.10)

this form of b(x) gives rise to the following form for the photon propagator in the
infrared k  0,

 


k4 ,

k  0

(4.11)

notice, as a consistency check, that the photon continues to be massless in the
chiral-symmetry broken phase. the corresponding static eective potential is given
by the appropriate fourier transform of the 00 (temporal) component of the photon
propagator for k0 = 0. in the case (4.11) this yields formally an eective potential
scaling like r2 for large distances r, suggestive of conning behaviour 4. the fact

4however, this is a formal result, given that the corresponding momentum integrals are infrared
divergent and hence need proper regularization, which falls beyond our scope here. for standard
treatments see discussions in [12].

that this behaviour is found in the chiral-symmetry broken case is consistent with
general (four-dimensional) arguments [12, 14] that connement is a sucient but
not necessary condition for chiral-symmetry breaking.

an important feature of the expressions (4.6) and (4.8) is that, although they
are derived only in case where a fermion mass m 6= 0, however they do not explicitly
depend on the magnitude of the mass. from (4.6) and (4.10) one obtains for z(x)
in the infrared region x  0:

z(x) = b1/2(x)a1(x)

where we have chosen the constant of integration c1 such that there are no o(x2)
terms.
in order to check under which conditions the omission of the x-dependent parts
of z next to those of g(x) is justied, we must compare the corresponding linear
terms in x of both quantities. using that

this requires:

q8/3 g3(0)  2 g2(0)  (32/5)m2 >> 0

(4.13)

(4.14)

this inequality furnishes a condition on g(0) under the assumption m << 1, which,
as we shall see in section 5, turns out to be correct. the condition is

g(0) >> s 3

2  1.22

(4.15)

in the above formulas the symbol >> means actually at least an order of magnitude.
as we shall see below, such a regime for g(0) arises self-consistently. note that the

condition (4.15) is in agreement with (2.16) given that z(0) = 36/5  1.47 (c.f.
eq. (4.12)) is only slighty larger than q3/2.

in view of the existence of a non-zero constant value of z(x) in the infrared
region, our analysis on the restrictions (3.15),(3.18) has to be repeated, given that
these restrictions stem from the integral equation. from (4.14), and the value z(0) =
36/5 it becomes clear that the boundary condition (3.14) is now modied to:

from the above relation it becomes clear that, if g(0) < 126/5 there is no restric-
tion on m. however, for this regime of the couplings the condition (4.15), necessary
for safely ignoring the eects of the inhomogeneous term z(p) in the infrared next
to g(p), is only marginally satised. on the other hand, if one allows g(0) to exceed
this value, which is physically acceptable, then the following upper bound on m as
a function of g(0) is obtained:

m <

figure 7: fermion mass versus the infrared-value of the coupling g(0) for the case
where the eects of the inhomogeneous term (almost constant) z(x) have been taken
into account in the infrared. the solid curve represents the condition derived from
the integral equation for the vertex, whereas the dashed line represents the solution
obtained from the standard gap equation in the large-n treatment.

from g. 7 we then obtain the following allowed range of the coupling g(0):

5.88 < g(0) < 7

(4.19)

to be compared with (3.18) associated with the monotonicity requirement for g(p).
this analysis shows that the new allowed region for the fermion masses, in case
(4.18) is:

0.55 < m < 0.6

(4.20)
where the lowest bound is the value of m corresponding to g = 5.88 from the large-
n-analysis formula (3.16). the region (4.20) is to be compared with (3.17). as we
shall see in section 5, the dynamically generated mass in our scenario, which does
not resort to a large-n treatment, lowers signicantly the upper bound in (4.20).

it is important to emphasize that, as a consequence of (4.5),(4.10), the non-
amputated vertex g(p), dened in (2.7), approaches a non-zero nite constant value
in the infrared p = 0. notice that this constant behaviour is compatible with the
ward identity in the infrared limit p = 0, thereby implying that the information
obtained about a non-trivial infrared xed-point structure is gauge invariant, as it
should be.

this completes our analysis of including the eects of an almost constant z(x) 
z(0) in the infrared. the above considerations justify retrospectively the omission
of z in deriving the dierential equation (3.7). indeed, a constant shift of g inside
the derivative operators in that equation, which would account for a constant z,
does not aect its form. these results, therefore, constitute a highly non-trivial
check of our approach.

5 dynamical derivation of the fermion mass gap

in the previous section we have assumed the presence of a nite fermion mass, which
we have treated eectively as an arbitrary parameter of the model. in this section
we turn to the full problem, and study the dynamical generation of this mass, by
deriving it self-consistently from the corresponding sd mass-gap equation.

the equation for the gap (p) is derived from the graphs of g. 2, which yields:

a(p)/p + (p) = /p + a(p)e2z

d3k
(2)3

g(k)2

/k + m(k)

(k  p)2

(5.1)

where m(k)  (k)/a(k) is the mass function, and we have pulled out factors of
a(p) appropriately so as to be able to dene an amputated vertex function g(k).
the consistency of the approach will be demonstrated below by the existence of
solutions.

taking the trace in the above equation, and performing the angular integration,

one arrives easily at:

g(k)2m(k)ln(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

k + p

k2 + m 2(k)

from the middle equation (5.2) it becomes clear that the quantity gr(k)  e g(k),
dened in (2.10), plays indeed the role of a running coupling. the situation is
analogous, but not identical, to that of [11], where a running coupling has also
been obtained from the gap equation in the context of a large n analysis. however,
in that case, one assumed an ansatz for the vertex, satisfying a truncated form of the
ward identities. instead, in our approach there was no necessity for a vertex ansatz,
since the non-perturbative vertex function was determined self-consistently from the
sd equations. as a consequence, the running coupling (2.10) is constructed out of

the amputated vertex function alone; the latter is a manifestly gauge-independent
quantity, at least perturbatively.

passing into dimensionless variables, in units of  = e2/8, m  m(k)/, x 
p/, y  k/, and working in the regime of low momenta x << 1 as usual, one
obtains after some straightforward algebra, involving a truncated expansion of the
logarithmic kernel:

we now restrict ourselves to the region 5,

second kind [17]. the latter is only dened for positive n and this imposes the choice
c2 = 0 in (5.8). expressing the solution in terms of x, x  0, one has the following
power series expression for the dynamical mass:

m (x) = c1x1

5note that this is the opposite limit than the one usually considered in the framework of large-

assumption  >> p >> m for the momenta p of the pertinent excitations.

have a critical coupling, above which dynamical mass generation occurs. however,
because the result (5.10) has been derived in the context of the solution (3.11),
one should bear in mind the restrictions characterizing that situation, in particular

this restriction implies a critical coupling, gc = 126/5  5.88 but it is derived

in a way independent of any large-n analysis. the way to understand (5.11) is the
following: one should rst x a range of g(0), with g(0) > 5.88, and then use a
c1 that will be such that, within this range of the couplings, eq. (5.11) is satised
for masses m << 1. as can be readily seen, the bound for c1 obtained from the
requirement that m << 1 is far less restrictive than the one associated with (5.11),
provided g(0) is not too close to the critical gc, where the mass m vanishes. for
instance, for g(0) = o(8), the upper bound on c1 from (5.11) is of order o(104),
while for g(0) = 6 the upper bound is c1 < 4. notice that the bound is very
sensitive to small changes in g(0).

a typical situation is depicted in g. 8 for two values of c1 = 105, 102. we
observe that the case c1 = 102 yields an upper bound in the mass which is of order
0.8 and hence should be discarded on the basis that it is not small enough. on the
other hand, the value c1 = 105 yields an acceptable upper bound m  0.1. in that
case, from g. 8, we observe that the allowed region of m is

0.08 < m < 0.12

(5.12)

to be compared with (4.20), derived using the result for the mass in the context of
a large-n analysis [5]. the corresponding regime of the couplings g(0) is:

5.88 < g(0) < 11

(5.13)

before closing this section we would like to discuss possible applications of the
above behaviour; specically, the restriction (5.13) of the allowed values of g(0)
may have interesting applications in case the above model turns out to describe the
physics of high-temperature superconductors. we remind the reader that in such
models dynamical mass generation coincides with superconductivity [1]-[3]. in that

6the restriction (4.17) is to be viewed as a boundary condition. we remind the reader that the

requirement of niteness of m had already xed the other constant c2 to zero.

case, the fermion elds (electrons) of qed3 represent holons, i.e. electrically-
charged excitations of fermionic statistics, which are constituents of the physical
electron. the latter is believed to exhibit an eective spin-charge separation [26]
in the complicated ground-state of high-temperature superconductors. the pho-
ton of qed3 then represents an eective heisenberg spin-spin antiferromagnetic
interaction, responsible for binding the holons in cooper-like pairs. in some mod-
els [1, 3] the eective (gauge-invariant) coupling g(0) may be expressed in terms
of the parameters of the microscopic condensed-matter lattice systems, whose long-
wavelength limit is equivalent to the above qed3 model, as:

g(0)2 

j
e2 (1  )

(5.14)

where  expresses the concentration of impurities in the system (doping), and j
denotes the heisenberg (antiferromagnetic) exchange energy. hence, on account of

(5.13), eq. (5.14) implies that 6 < (j/e2)(1) < 11 for superconductivity to occur.
in phenomenologically acceptable models [1] e2/j  0.1, which implies an upper
bound on   0.4. however, the reader should bear in mind that the above-described
limiting values are rather indicative at present, given that a complete quantitative
understanding of the underlying dynamics of high-temperature superconductivity
from an eective gauge-theory point of view is still lacking.

6 equation for the vertex in the case of non-zero

photon mass

in this section we study the case where a (small) covariant photon mass  is added
to the photon propagator (2.6):

(k) 



k2 + 2

(6.1)

for the purposes of our analysis in this work, such a mass term will simply be added
by hand, without further discussions about its origin. however, we point out for com-
pleteness that a small photon mass may be the result of non-perturbative congura-
tions (instantons) in compact u(1) three-dimensional electrodynamics [27]. more-
over, a term acting like a photon mass term arises in real-time nite-temperature
considerations [28]; in the latter case, of course, one loses manifest lorentz covari-
ance.

it is straightforward to see that, in the presence of a photon mass, small compared
to the scale  = e2/8, the resulting integral equation for the amputated vertex reads:

g(p) =

(k  p)2 + 2(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

(6.2)

we are interested in the limit p << , which would allow us to study the eects of a
photon mass on the infrared regime of the theory. expanding the logarithm in (6.2)
appropriately, we obtain:

notice that the function g(x) increases monotonically with increasing x, for small x.
we next note that by choosing c appropriately one can satisfy the condition (4.15)

g(0) >> q3/2, required for self-consistency of the approximation of ignoring the

eects of the inhomogeneous term z(p) in the infrared. in such a case one expects
that at larger x the increase of the coupling stops at a certain (small) x = x0,
and then the coupling starts decreasing to reach asymptotically the perturbative
result g  1 (see g. 9). the existence of a local maximum is characteristic of
the eects of the photon mass on the infrared behaviour, to be contrasted with the
monotonically decreasing situation in the case of a non-zero fermion mass (see g.
6). we expect that in the general case, when both photon and fermion masses are
present, the running coupling will exhibit a local maximum at low x when the photon
mass is larger than the fermion mass, whilst this behaviour will be replaced by a
monotonic decrease, in the case when the fermion mass is considerably larger than
the photon one. this situation should be compared with the corresponding one in
four-dimensional qcd in the presence of non-vanishing gluon and quark masses [14].

note the bump at low momenta, which is absent in the case of non-zero fermionic
masses. the dashed part of the curve is conjectural at present, and can only be
derived numerically. continuous curves are the result of analytic studies.

before closing we discuss briey a physical situation which could be qualitatively
similar to the case of a covariant infrared cut-o in the form of a non-zero photon
mass, discussed in this section. this situation has been argued in [11] to simulate
nite-temperature eects, given that in such a case the photon propagator acquires
a longitudinal plasmon mass term:

(p0 = 0, p  0, t ) =

00

p 2 + m 2
00

+ longitudinal parts

(6.7)

where, for simplicity, we restricted ourselves to the instantaneous approximation [1],

p0 = 0, and the plasmon mass term

m00(t ) = s 2ln2t



(6.8)

we observe from the form (6.7) that the presence of the mass term m00 behaves for
low t somewhat analogously (but not identical to) a small photon cut-o mass .

prompted by this observation we would like now to make some speculations
regarding the low temperature eects of the  cut-o term in (6.5). we hasten
to emphasize that a discussion could at best only qualitatively correct, given that
a quantitative understanding would require a nite-temperature extension of the
above analysis. due to the loss of lorentz covariance in the respective propaga-
tors the analysis is far more complicated than the zero-temperature one. however,
when the temperature t is suciently low, its eects on the pole structure of the
photon propagator may be simulated by a covariant photon-mass cut-o, at least
qualitatively [11, 28]. for this reason, we are motivated to examine the eects of
 << 1 on the low-temperature scaling of the resistivity [4] ; the latter is dened
as the inverse of the conductivity f , which expresses the response of the system
to a change in an externally-applied electromagnetic potential a. ohms law, in a
gauge with a0 = 0, then, gives [29, 11, 4]:

f  1 =

1

(p 2 + p2

0) (1 + (p, p0, t )) |p =0

(6.9)

where (p, p0, t ) denotes the dimensionless photon polarization used in this work.
following the analysis of [28] we may assume for our discussion below that 7 :

(6.10)

from the discussion following (2.10) one immediately sees that the resistivity, dened
for p = 0, x2 = 2, would be given in terms of the running coupling g(p) by:

 = 2/ g2(0, t )

(6.11)

using (6.5) in the limit x2 = 2, one has:

the function  is plotted in gure (10), versus a single-power scaling behaviour of

ical condensed-matter models [30], and has been used in order to bound possible

7the analysis of [28] is based on a real-time nite temperature approach. in such an approach
the resistivity is dened in the infrared limit p0  0, p = 0 in the presence of a plasmon mass
term m00 (6.8) in the photon propagator; as noted in [28], the way in which the two mass scales
(p0, p ) approach 0 suers from ambiguities, related to physical landau-damping processes; it is
not our purpose here to resolve such issues.

deviations from the experimentally-observed linear-t behaviour of the resistivity of
high-temperature superconductors at optimal doping [4].

we observe that, upon appropriate choice of the integration constant c, the
temperature dependence of (6.12) for a low-temperature regime, accessible to ex-
periment, is hardly distinguishable from the single power scaling behaviour.

7 conclusions and outlook

in this work we have presented a study of chiral-symmetry breaking in qed3,
based on a system of coupled non-linear sd equations. the novel ingredient is
the introduction of a semi-amputated vertex, whose dynamics is governed by a
suitably truncated sd equation of cubic order. this allows for a self-consistent
determination of the infrared value of the eective charge, in the presence of infrared
cutos provided by either the fermion mass or a covariant photon mass. the theory
is characterized by a (gauge-invariant) non-trivial infrared xed-point, suggestive of
non-fermi liquid behaviour [15, 11].

the non-linear vertex equation furnishes highly non-trivial constraints among the
infrared value of the eective coupling and the mass of the fermions. when these
constraints are combined with the fermion mass-gap equation, they select specic
regions of the coupling space for which dynamical mass generation occurs. it will
be interesting to study how these constraints are aected if one goes beyond the
one-loop dressed approximation considered here.

from the physical point of view, we remark that dynamical fermion mass gener-
ation in qed3 is associated with superconductivity [1, 3]. in the relevant statistical
models, whose low-energy eective theories are of qed3 type, the couplings depend
on the doping concentration. therefore the restrictions in the parameter space we
have found above might impose restrictions in the allowed models.

an interesting feature of our approach is the fact that the infrared structure of
the photon propagator, derived as a consistent solution of a sd equation, implied
formally a conning eective potential. the fact that this behaviour occurs in the
chiral-symmetry broken phase of the theory, appears to be in agreement with generic
expectations that connement is a sucient condition for chiral symmetry breaking.
an obvious next step in this programme is the attempt to solve the coupled
system of sd equations numerically, without the approximation of ignoring the
eects of the inhomogeneous term z(p) in the infrared. we remind the reader
that in the present work we have restricted the allowed values of the coupling such
that this approximation was self-consistent. this, however, does not imply that
solutions with z(p) not meeting these requirements are impossible; to establish or
exclude their existence one should solve the whole system of equations, which at
present can only be done numerically. such a numerical treatment will have the
additional advantage of not resorting to the approximations made to the kernel of
the integral equations in order to convert them into dierential ones.

furthermore, an analysis at nite temperatures will reveal whether our conjec-
ture in section 6, on the scaling behaviour of the resistivity, is correct. as we have
discussed there, this issue acquires great importance in view of very accurate ex-
periments in high-temperature superconductors indicating a basically linear scaling
with temperatures of the resistivity in the normal phase (no fermion mass gap) of
the system.

finally, an extension of these ideas to the non-abelian case appears as a chal-
lenge for the future, especially in view of recent claims [3, 31] that non-abelian
gauge symmetries might describe the dynamics of spin-charge separation in realistic
antiferromagnetic condensed-matter systems [26].
