abstract

the quantum properties of solitons at one loop can be related to phase shifts
of waves on the soliton background. these can be combined with heat kernel
methods to calculate various parameters. the vacuum energy of a c p (1)
soliton in 2 + 1 dimensions is calculated as an example.

i. introduction

solitons arise in many eld theories and their particle-like behaviour has prompted dis-
cussions of their quantum properties [1]. recently, some old results of schwinger [2] have
been developed into a useful numerical scheme for calculating the vacuum energy of a soliton
at one loop order [3,4]. the aim of this paper is to develop these ideas further using heat
kernel methods and discuss some applications.

the one loop corrections to the soliton energies are likely to be most signicant in
situations where dierent classical soliton solutions have the same energy. this happens
in an important class of eld theories, where the classical solutions fall into topologically
seperate families and the solutions in each family saturates an energy bound. the prototype
for this behaviour was the bps monopole solution [5], but similar solutions play an important
role in superstring theories [6].

the cp (1) model in 2 + 1 dimensions is one of the simplest models of this type [7,8].
the calculation of the vacuum energy of the single soliton solution provides an instructive
example of the general technique. a useful comparison can also be made with the cp (1)
model in two dimensions, where the one loop contribution to the path integral from instanton
solutions has been obtained analytically [9,10].

ii. heat kernel method

the one loop quantum properties of a soliton solution depend on the normal mode
frequencies of classical perturbations about the solution. it will prove convenient to impose
boundary conditions at a xed radius r on the perturbations in order to obtain a discrete
spectrum and then take the limit r  .

the heat kernel is dened by

k(t) = x ek2t,

(1)

where the sum extends over the discrete spectrum with values k2. for large r, the normal
modes with real k approach trigonometric functions of kr + , where  is a constant phase
depending on k and a set of other parameters . if no solitons are present, then the normal
mode frequencies (denoted by a superscript zero) are given by

k(0)r + (0) = n + ,

(2)

where  is a phase that depends on the boundary conditions. in the presence of the soliton,
the real frequencies are given by

kr +  = n + .

(3)

in the limit r  , k  k(0), and the heat kernel can be expressed in terms of the phase
shift by

k(t)  k (0)(t) =

2

 z 

0

dk ek2tktx

(k)

(4)

where  =   (0).

in fact, the n = 1 states can disappear from the continuum in the r   limit if
(0) 6= 0 and the derivative 
(0) = 0. in this case the phase shift must be displaced onto
a new branch. furthermore, bound states have their own asymptotic behaviour and need
to be added as a seperate contribution to equation (4). if there are n0 bound states with
k = 0, equation (4) becomes

k(t)  k (0)(t) = n0 +

dk ek2tktx

((k)  (0)).

(5)

levinsons theorem [11] implies that the two expressions (4) and (5) are usually identical.
however, in some situations (including the cp (1) soliton), levinsons theorem does not
apply and equation (5) in the one that must be used.

an important feature of the heat kernel is the well-understood behaviour of the t  0

limit in d dimensions [12,13],

k(t)  td/2 xn=0

bntn

(6)

where the heat kernel coecients bn determine the one loop ultra-violet divergencies of the
theory. finite parts of physical quantities can be obtained from a regulated heat kernel,

kreg(t) = k(t)  td/2

(d+1)/2

xn=0

bntn

(7)

the heat kernel coecients are integrals of local polynomials of the background elds and
their derivatives. explicit results are known for the rst few coecients [14,15].

the rst term in the asymptotic expansion is equivalent to the free heat kernel k (0). a
simple comparison shows that inserting the rst born approximation to the phase shifts (1)
into equation (4) produces next term in the asymptotic expansion with the coecient b1.
however, the second order born approximation (2)
involves a double integral which contains
contributions to b2 and higher terms. the part responsible for b2 can be isolated by taking
a derivative expansion and keeping only the leading term. this allows us to express the
regulated heat kernel in terms of phase shifts,





kreg(t) = n0 +

where  =   (1)
keeping only local terms with m derivatives and 2n + 4m  d + 1.

  . . ., subtracting the nth order born approximations to the phase shift

the heat kernel can be used to nd the vacuum energy of a soliton in d + 1 dimensions
or the eective action of an instanton in d dimensions. the vacuum energy of a soliton in
d + 1 dimensions is given by 1

the eective action of an instanton on d dimensions is given by  1
2  (0). a proper time
cuto  on the lower limit of the integral can be introduced to regularise the theory [17].
inserting equation (8) gives

the nite part is now in a form that can be evaluated numerically and the pole terms, which
depend on the heat kernel coecients, can be absorbed by renormalisation.

farhi et al. [4] have obtained expressions for the vacuum energy in 3 + 1 dimensions by
subtracting the full rst and second order phase shifts. this corresponds to subtracting an
expansion of the heat kernel with nonlocal factors. such an expansion does indeed exist [18],
although the local version is sucient for removing the divergencies.

iii. cp(1) soliton

the cp (1) model in 2 + 1 dimensions x,  = 0 . . . 2, has a complex eld u with

lagrangian density

l = 

1
g2

u u
(1 + uu)2

(12)

where g2 is an energy scale. the solutions to the eld equations fall into families charac-
terised by a topological index [7]. the single soliton solution centered at the origin can be
written u1 = /z, where  is a constant and z is the complex coordinate x1 + ix2.

perturbations  about the soliton satisfy the equation

 4dzdz = k2

(13)

where dz = z and dz = z  2u1(zu1)/(1 + u1u1). there is one normalisable zero mode
 = z2 and the remaining spectrum is positive. the rst heat kernel coecient for this
operator can be evaluated from standard formulae [14,15] or by the atiyah-singer index
theorem [13] to be b1 = 1.

the perturbation equation separates, and with the decomposition  = (1+2/r2)umeim,

where the potential

the boundary conditions are

(14)

(15)

(16)

the potential does not meet the integrability requirements of levinsons theorem [11] and the
numerical solution shows the unusual behaviour that m(0) =  for m  1 and m(0) = 
for m < 2.

the rst born approximation to the phase shifts can be evaluted in terms of bessel
m (k) = (2m)im(k)km(k). the sum over m is not formally convergent,

however the limit

is well dened and when substituted into equation (5) gives the correct conclusion that
b1 = n0. this denition of the m   limit should also be used for actual phase shifts.

the vacuum energy e can be obtained from equation (10), with the observation that

the rst born approximation cancels due to (17),

the energy decreases as the width of the soliton decreases. however, if the width of the
soliton changed with time, there would be an adiabatic solution of the form u = (t)/z, but
this solution has innite action. the value of  must therefore remain xed assymptotically,
although it may decrease locally.

the loop expansion parameter for the single soliton is eectively g2/, and so continuing
to analysis to more than one loop would introduce further inverse powers of  [19]. this
raises the possibility that the energy has a minimum at some value of .
