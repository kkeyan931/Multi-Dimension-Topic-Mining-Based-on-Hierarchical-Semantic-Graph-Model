abstract

we derive a generalised concavity condition for potentials between static sources obtained
from wilson loops coupling both to gauge bosons and a set of scalar elds. it involves the
second derivatives with respect to the distance in ordinary space as well as with respect
to the relative orientation in internal space. in addition we discuss the use of this eld
theoretical condition as a nontrivial consistency check of the ads/cft duality.

1 introduction

the ads/cft duality conjecture [1, 2, 3] has passed an impressive number of consistency
checks [4]. however, among these tests only few are not relying in one or another way on
structures enforced by supersymmetry and/or conformal invariance. in this situation it
appears worthwhile to further analyse any possible constraint set by the rst principles of
quantum eld theory and to check, whether they are fullled by the corresponding dual
partners in string theory/supergravity.

in this sense the present letter is devoted to the concavity of the potential between
static sources in a gauge theory.
in the euclidean formulation osterwalder-schrader
reection positivity [5] ensures this property for potentials derived from wilson loops
[6, 11]. in the ads/cft context the issue of concavity has been raised in ref.[7]. but
the discussion so far has not taken into account the degree of freedom connected with the
relative orientation of the static sources (q q) in internal space.

we will ll this gap by analysing in some detail the consequences of os reection pos-
itivity for potentials derived in standard manner from wilson loops for contours coupling
both to the gauge bosons and to a set of scalar elds in the adjoint representation. we
take the wilson loop in the form suggested in [8, 9] and analysed in various ways in [10].
for the case where the gauge bosons and the scalars are just the bosonic elds of d = 4,
n = 4 super-yang-mills theory it has been characterised as an object of bps type [10].
our discussion closely follows [11]. the new input in our presentation is the handling
of the contour parameter dependent coupling to the scalars, which is described by a curve
on s5. we also take care of the fact that the wilson loop of refs.[9, 10] is the trace of a
generically non-unitary matrix.

the virtue of the arising concavity condition lies in its inequality property. it has to
be fullled both for the classical sugra approximation and for the expressions obtained
by adding successive corrections. therefore, a violation at any level of approximation on
the superstring side would indicate a breakdown of the corresponding duality.

2 generalised concavity for potentials derived from

bps wilson loops

we start with the functional (a x = a x,  = jj,  = 0, .., 3,

j = 4, .., 9)

uab[x, ] = (cid:18)p expz {ia(x(s)) x(s) + (x(s))(s)| x|}ds(cid:19)ab

.

(1)

the expectation value of its trace for a closed path x(s) yields the wilson loop under
investigation [9, 10]. (s) species the coupling to the scalars  along the contour x(s).

a reection operation r is dened by

(rx)1(s) = x1(s) ;

(rx)(s) = x(s),  6= 1
ruab[x, ] = uab[rx,i] .

(2)

1

for later purpose we allow the combination of the reection with the application of some
isometry i  o(6) of s5 on the path (s).
reformulate the r.h.s in the second line of (2) applying the following steps

using the hermiticity of the matrices a,  in the form a = at,  = t we can

uab[x, ] = (cid:18)p expz sf
= (cid:18) p expz sf

si {iat(x(s)) x(s) + t(x(s))(s)| x|}ds(cid:19)ab
si {ia(x(s)) x(s) + (x(s))(s)| x|}ds(cid:19)ba

.

(3)

here p, p denote ordering of matrices from right to left with increasing/decreasing argu-
ment s. p applied to the path x yields the same result as p applied to the backtracking
path

(bx)(s) = x(sf + si  s),

(b)(s) = (sf + si  s) .

therefore, we get

this, combined with (2), yields nally

uab[x, ] = uba[bx,b] .

ruab[x, ] = uba[brx,bi] .

(4)

(5)

(6)

it is worth pointing out that for the result (5) the presence/absence of the factor i in front
of the a and  term in u is crucial. one could consider this as another argument for the
choice favoured by the investigations of ref. [10].

we now turn to a formal derivation2 of the basic osterwalder-schrader positivity

condition for functionals u[x, ] for contours x  h+, h = {x|  x1 > 0}
huab[x, ]ruab[x, ]i = z daduab[x, ]uab[rx,i] es

= z (da)+(d)+uab[x, ] es+ z (da)(d)uab[rx,i] es .
 on the functional integrand as well as on the action indicates that it refers to points in
h. rx is situated in h, but has the same form as x. both the functional measure as
well as the action are invariant with respect to   i. therefore, due to the symmetry
of the problem, we can as in ref.[11] conclude, that in the last formula line the second
factor is the complex conjugate of the rst one, resulting in

(7)

huab[x, ]ruab[x, ]i  0 .

in standard manner this implies for two dierent paths x(1), x(2)  h+
huab[x(1), (1)] ruab[x(2), (2)]i2  huab[x(1), (1)] ruab[x(1), (1)]i

(8)

(9)

2our rigorous statement is: assuming reection positivity (8) one gets the generalized concavity (13).

 huab[x(2), (2)] ruab[x(2), (2)]i .

let us continue with the discussion of a wilson loop for a closed contour which crosses
the reection hyperplane twice and which is the result of going rst along x  h and
then along x+  h+:

we have used (2), rrx = x, (9) and the usual schwarz inequality in the last step. now

to evaluate the potential between two static sources (q q) separated by the distance l
and located at xed s5-positions q,  q we need wilson loops for rectangular contours of
extension lt in the large t -limit. we choose the s5-position on the two l-sides linearly
interpolating between q and  q on the corresponding great circle. for this restricted set
of contours the wilson loop becomes a function of l, t and the angle between q and
 q, called .

3

in addition it is useful to restrict ourselves to contours which are situated in planes
orthogonal to the reection hyperplane and with t -sides running parallel to it in a distance
l
2 , see g.1. as a further specication we choose i  o(6) in such a way that (s),
which both lie on the great circle through q and  q, are reected with respect to the
common s5-position of the points a and b, see g.1. then (11) implies

(13)

other choices 3 of i  o(6) and/or rectangles not in planes orthogonal to the reection
hyperplane lead for the r.h.s. of (11) to wilson loops not belonging to the restricted set
discussed above. however, assuming that the large t -behaviour is independent of the
parts of the contour connecting the two large t -sides, which represent the world lines of
the static sources, we get the more general inequality

as a corrolary of the last inequality we nd by looking at  = 0 that v (l, ) is monotonously
nondecreasing both in l and .

concluding this general part we derive a local statement.

this is our main result.
it means concavity on each straight line across the origin, in
the relevant part of the (l, )-plane, 0 < l < , 0 <   . here concavity means
dt2  0 both for choosing l or l2 + 2 as the contour parameter t. together with
the monotony statement, this gives essential constraints on the overall view of the graph
v (l, ).

3 test of the generalised concavity condition for po-

tentials derived via ads/cft duality

the simplicity of the calculation recipe for wilson loops in the classical sugra approx-
imation via ads/cft duality allows to make statements on universal properties of the

3e.g. rotations around the common s 5-position of a and b.

arising q q-potential for a large class of sugra backgrounds [12, 13]. we now enter
a discussion of (15) within this framework. the metric of the sugra background is
assumed in the form

gm n dxm dxn = g00(u)dx0dx0 + g||(u)dxmdxm + guu(u)dudu + g(u)d2

5 . (16)

then with

f (u) = g00g||,

g(u) = g00guu,

j(u) = g00g

(17)

we get along the lines of [9, 12, 13, 14]

under square roots above are positive and where the inversion u0 = u0(l, ),

neglecting for a moment the issue of internal space dependence by restricting oneselves
to the case  = l = 0, one nds usual concavity in l from (22) if f

inequality is for f  > 0 guaranteed by theorem 1 of ref.[13]. 4
therefore, for  = 0 standard concavity of q q-potentials with respect to the distance
in usual space is guaranteed for the wide class of sugra backgrounds covered by theorem
1 of ref.[13].

however, due to the more complicated structure of the l.h.s. of (22) for  6= 0 we

4 concluding remarks

the q q-potential derived [9] from the classical sugra approximation for the type iib
string in ads5s5 fulls our generalised concavity condition at   0. this adds another
consistency check of this most studied case within the ads/cft duality.
potentials have been almost completely studied only for  = 0 in other backgrounds.
at least partly, this might be due to the wisdom to approach in some way qcd, where
after all there is no place for a parameter like this angle between dierent orientations in
s5. however, one has to keep in mind that this goal, in the approaches discussed so far,
requires some additional limiting procedure. before the limit the full 10-dimensionality

7

inherited by the string is still present. fluctuation determinants in all 10 directions have
to be taken into account for quantum corrections [7, 15] and the -dependence of the
potentials is of course not switched o.

although we proved in classical sugra approximation monotony in l and  as well
as concavity at  = 0 for a whole class of backgrounds, we were not able to get a similar
general result on concavity for  > 0. further work is needed to decide, whether at all
general statements for  > 0 are possible. alternatively one should perform case by case
studies for backgrounds derived e.g. from rotating branes [16], type zero strings [17] or
nonsupersymmetric solutions of type iib string theory [18].
