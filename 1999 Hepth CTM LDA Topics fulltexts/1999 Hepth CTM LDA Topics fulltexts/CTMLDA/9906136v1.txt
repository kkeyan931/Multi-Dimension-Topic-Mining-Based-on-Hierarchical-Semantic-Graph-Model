1. introduction.

in standard quantum mechanical theories the s-matrix encodes the physically ob-
servable properties: transition probabilities between scattering-states and energy levels of
bound states. in this note we are similarly concerned with energy levels and transition
probabilities of physical systems which have been q-deformed. the examples we consider
are speculative deformations of real physical systems which have been extensively discussed
in diverse ways. because of the consequent arbitrariness and ambiguities in these dierent
approaches it is perhaps useful to attempt a more uniform interpretation of a few typical
cases.

2. the q-oscillator.1

in the fock representation the q-oscillator is dened by the hamiltonian

where a and a satisfy

h =

1
2

(aa + aa)h

(a, a)q = aa  qaa = 1 .

the time dependence of these operators is given by the q-dirac rule:

ih a = (a, h)q  a  eit

operating on eigenstates of h the a and a satisfy

and

where hni is the basic number

a|ni = hni1/2|n  1i
a|ni = hn + 1i1/2|n + 1i

h|ni =

1

2(cid:2)hni + hn + 1i(cid:3)h

hni =

qn  1
q  1

.

denote the ground state by |0i. then the nth state is

set

then (2.2) may be rewritten as

|ni  an|0i .

a = (cid:18) a

a(cid:19) .

ata = q1/2

(2.1)

(2.2)

(2.3)

(2.4a)

(2.4b)

(2.5)

(2.6)

(2.7)

(2.8)

(2.9)

where

 = (cid:18) 0

q1/2

q1/2

0 (cid:19) .

(2.10)

one may transform to other representations by the following canonical transformation, t ,
belonging to suq(2)

where t satises

then

and if one sets

then

a = t x , t suq(2)

t tt = t t t =  .

x tx = q1/2

x = (cid:18) i
x (cid:19)
h p

qxp  px = ih .

(2.11)

(2.12)

(2.13)

(2.14)

(2.15)

these relations may be satised in conguration space by the pair (ihdq
mentum space by the pair (p, iq1dq1

x, x) or in mo-
p ) where the d are the following dierence operators:

dq

x(x) =

dq1

p (p) =

(qx)  (x)

qx  x

(q1p)  (p)

q1p  p

q1 = q1 .

t = (cid:18)

(cid:19) .

 = q (a)
  = q  (b)
  = 
(c)

  +   = 1
 + q2
1

(d)
 = 1 (e)

and

set

then (2.12) implies

by (2.11)

p(cid:19) + x

h

a = (cid:18) i
a = q1 (cid:18) i

p(cid:19) + x .

h

(2.16a)

(2.16b)

(2.17)

(2.18)

(2.19)

(2.20)

by (2.7) and (2.20) the eigenstates may be expressed in either the x and p representation
and are the products of q-gaussian and q-hermite polynomials.1 these expressions will

3

depend upon basic numbers and some version of basic hermite functions in either x or p
and will agree with the usual expressions in the q = 1 limit. the x and p amplitudes are
related by q-fourier transforms:

n(x) = z 
n(x) = z 





eq(ipx)n()dqp

eq1(iqx)n(x)dqx

where eq(ipx) is an eigenstate of p:

eq(ipx) = x (ipx)n

hni!

and the q-integrals are jackson integrals (inverse of q-dierentiation).

however, all of these functions lie in the subalgebra generated by  and . that
basic numbers and basic hyper-geometric functions replace the usual expressions does not
concern us. on the other hand, that the wave functions lie in an algebra and are not
numerically valued requires attention.

if the operator associated with a transition between two states, m and n, is a, then
the usual transition amplitude is hn|a|mi and the corresponding transition probability is
|hn|a|mi|2; but if the states as well as the operator lie in the algebra, |hn|a|mi|2 does
not have its usual interpretation since it is not numerically valued. there are two natural
procedures for dealing with the problem.

the rst way to attach a numerical measure to |hn|a|mi|2 is to form the woronowicz

measure as follows:

h|hn|a|mi|2

(2.21)

where h stands for the woronowicz integral over the algebra. it may be evaluated term
by term with the aid of the following result:

where

h[sn m] = somnqn/[m + 1]q

[m] =

qm  qm
q  q1

.

(2.22)

(2.23)

on top of this integration there is the usual x or p integration.

in an alternative procedure, which is also natural since it is also based on the q-algebra,

we construct a hilbert space as follows:

because  and  commute they have common eigenstates. let |0i, the groundstate

of this hilbert space, be a common eigenstate of  and . then

|0i = b|0i
|0i = b|0i
|0i = 0 .

4

(2.24)

to see that  and  are consistent creation and destruction equations dene

by iteration of (2.19a)

|ni  n|0i .

|ni = (qnb)|ni .

then |ni is an eigenstate of  and  and

where

|ni = n|n + 1i
|ni = n|n  1i

n = (1  |b|2q2n)1/2
n = n1 .

(2.25)

(2.26)

(2.27)

(2.28)

(2.29)
(2.30)

following this alternative procedure one now replaces hn |a|m i by hnn |a|mm i where
n and m refer to states of the associated hilbert space. now a state of the q-oscillator
carries two quantum numbers, n and n , and the matrix elements are numerically valued.
attaching a new quantum number, n, is analogous to the procedure in pauli spin theory
where one multiplies an atomic wave function by an independent spin function. the q-
oscillator interpreted in this way has internal degrees of freedom.

3. the q-coulomb problem (the q-hydrogen atom).2

the schrodinger dierential equation in conguration space becomes an integral equa-
tion in momentum space. to emphasize the o(3) symmetry of the coulomb problem one
may map momentum space onto the group space of o(3) according to

po  i~p ~
po + i~p ~

1

2 i~ ~w

= e

(3.1)

where po and ~p refer to the energy and momentum while ~w xes the magnitude and axis
of rotation. since the problem is non-relativistic the relativistic bound state energy e is

it is then possible to cast this integral equation into the following form:

e = 

p2
o
2m

.

where

z k(~p, ~p)(~p)d (~p) = cpo(~p)

c =

h

me2

5

(3.2)

(3.3)

and

k(~p, ~p ) = xjm

dj

m(~p)dj

m(~p ) .

(3.4)

here k is a rescaled fourier transform of the potential and  is the rescaled wave function.
the dj
m(~p) are wigner functions (matrix elements of irreducible representations of the
rotation group). these functions satisfy the orthogonality relations

z dj

m(~p)dj 

m (~p)d (~p) = jj 

mm  /2j + 1 .

(3.5)

by (3.3), (3.4), and (3.5) one sees that the eigenfunctions of (3.3) are

j

m(~p) = dj

m(~p)

and the eigenvalues are

cpo =

1

2j + 1

and by (3.2) one nds the balmer formula for the energy

e = 

1
2m

1
e2

1

(2j + 1)2 = 

1
2

where the principal quantum number is

n = 2j + 1 .

mc2(cid:18) e2

hc(cid:19)2 1

n 2

(3.6)

(3.7)

(3.8)

(3.9)

the other indices m and  labelling j
m refer to the z-components of the lenz and angular
momentum vectors. these are the conserved integrals of the motion. the o(4) algebra
of this system is reected in the o(3)  o(3) symmetry of the left and right parameter
groups.

the amplitude in momentum space (~p) is related to (~p) by a rescaling as follows:

here g(p) is the propagator:

mm (~p) = g2(p)dj
j

mm(~p) .

g(p) =

po

p2 + p2
o

.

(3.10)

(3.11)

we shall now dene the q-coulomb problem by deforming the integral equation (3.3).
to formulate this new equation it is necessary to dene integration over the q-group
space. this may be done by again making use of the haar measure introduced by
woronowicz who established orthogonality relations that may be expressed as follows:

h( dj

mdj 

m ) = jj 

mm q2m/[2j + 1]q

(3.12)

6

where h is the haar measure and d a unitary representation. in our notation the preceding
equation is

zw

dj

m(|q)dj 

m (|q)d () = jj 

mm  q2m/[2j + 1]q

(3.13)

where f () lies in the algebra generated by (, , , ), rw means a woronowicz integral,

m(|q) is a matrix element of an irreducible representation of the q-group. the

and dj
deformed integral equation corresponding to (3.3) is

zw

kq(, )(, q)d () = cpo(|q)

where the kernel is

kq(, ) = x dj

m(|q) dj

m(|q) .

utilizing the orthogonality relations as before one nds that

(|q) = dj

m(|q)

and

e(n, ) = 

1
2

mc2(cid:18) e2

hc(cid:19)2 q4

[n ]2

(3.14)

(3.15)

(3.16)

(3.17)

where n (= 2j + 1) is again the principal quantum number. here

[n ] =

qn  qn
q  q1

,

inherited from (3.12).

in the q = 1 limit one recovers the usual results.

if q 6= 1, the expression for the
energy is modied, similar to the way it was for the oscillator, by the substitution of the
basic number [n ] for n .

the factor q4 reveals that the coulomb degeneracy is lifted and that the q-system

no longer has spherical symmetry.

since the wavefunctions dj

m(|q) lie in the algebra, one has the same problem in
computing transition probabilities that one has for the oscillator or for any other problem
obtained by q-deformation; and one can handle the problem in the ways suggested for the
oscillator. probably the simpler procedure is to evaluate these probabilities as squares of
matrix elements between states of the hilbert space dened by the algebra. in doing this
we are explicitly recognizing that the q-system has new degrees of freedom not belonging
to the q = 1 system but we are not discarding the usual quantum mechanical rules of
interpretation.

this hilbert space is intrinsic to the formalism and in fact is very similar to the usual
fock space. the suggested procedure is analogous to the evaluation of operator elds
in fock space, i.e., the q-deformed problem is more like a quantum eld problem than a
one-particle quantum mechanical problem.

7

the q = 1 oscillator as well as the q = 1 hydrogen atom are themselves idealizations
of real physical systems. whether these new q 6= 1 systems are also useful idealizations of
more complex physical systems is not known.

4. q-field theory.3

an arbitrary eld may be expanded as follows:

(x) = x

[a()f(, x) + b()g(, x)]

(4.1)

where  is a generic tensor index and

x

= xr z d~p

 = (~p, r)

f(, x) 

g(, x) 

u(~p, r)
(2po)1/2 eipx
v(~p, r)
(2po)1/2 eipx .

(4.2a)

(4.2b)

(4.2c)

here a(a) and b(b) are absorption (emission) operators of particles and antiparticles re-
spectively. the  sum is an integration over momentum and a sum over spin states (r).
the particle and antiparticle parts of the sum are related by complex conjugation of the
exponentials and by charge conjugation of the spin dependent functions.

let us now impose the q-commutators

(a(p), a(p))q = (p, p)
(b(p), b(p))q = (p, p)
(a(p), b(p))q = 0
(b(p), a(p))q = 0

in standard theory q = 1 (1) describes the (boson) fermion elds.

one may also dene the q time-ordered product

tq((x), (x)) = (x)(x)
= q(x)(x)

t > t
t < t

(4.3a)

(4.3b)
(4.3c)

(4.3d)

(4.4)

again correct for both bosonic and fermionic elds. finally introduce the q-modied s
matrix:

s(q) = tq(cid:18)exp(cid:0)iz l(x)d4x(cid:1)(cid:19) .

(4.5)

in the standard way, we take the transition probability between an incoming state a and an
outgoing state b to be |hb|s(q)|ai|2 where a+ and b+ are products of creation operators

8

that represent dierent collections of particles. here

|ai = a+|0i
hb| = h0|b

hb|s|ai = h0|bsa+|0i

(4.6a)

(4.6b)
(4.6c)

again following the usual procedures hb|s(q)|ai is expanded and evaluated with the
aid of wicks theorem for normal products. in putting a string of absorption and emission
operators in normal form one picks up a power of q instead of a power of -1. continuing
this procedure one arrives at a set of feynman rules diering from the standard rules by
the substitution of q-dependent internal propagator for the usual internal propagators.

one nds for the vector elds

d(x) = (cid:18)g 

and for spinor elds



m2 (cid:19)(cid:18) 1

2(cid:19)4 1 + q

2

z eikx(cid:18)

1

k2  m2 +

1  q
1 + q

ko

 (cid:19)d4k

(4.7)

s(x) = (/ + m)(cid:18) 1

2(cid:19)4(cid:18) 1  q

2 (cid:19)z eikx(cid:20)

1

k2  m2 +

1 + q
1  q

ko

 (cid:21)d4k

where

 = (~k2 + m2)1/2 .

(4.8)

(4.9)

for the standard vector (spinor) eld q = 1(1) these propagators reduce to their standard
form.

one may test these expressions by computing, for example, electron-electron scatter-
ing or electron-positron annihilation. one obtains the standard (moller) expression for
electron-electron scattering and the standard (bhabha) expression for electron-positron
annihilation but both expressions are multiplied by frame dependent factors.

in this way one sees that q-quantization imposed in the minimal way we have described
breaks the lorentz symmetry. a somewhat similar result was obtained in discussing the
q-coulomb problem where the q-quantization (there dierently implemented) breaks the
rotational symmetry.

the preceding result suggests that the argument be reversed by postulating a q-
symmetry group at the outset. one may therefore introduce the q-lorentz group by
dening its spin representation lq as follows:

q detqlq = lt

qqlq = lqqlt

q ,

detqlq = 1 .

(4.10)

here q is the q-deformed levi-civita matrix as before and eq. (4.10) is also the denition
of the q-determinant of lq. if q = 1, eq. (4.10) exactly denes the spin representation of
the lorentz group.

to see how the postulate of q-lorentz invariance might work out, one may focus on
the correlation functions (vacuum expectation values of products of interacting elds) since

9

these determine the structure of the theory. without going into details, the essential new
element now introduced by the q-symmetry is that the interacting elds lie in a q-algebra
and, just as for the simple systems already discussed, there are new degrees of freedom
that give rise to new quantum numbers determined by the hilbert space associated with
the algebra.

in a q-yang-mills theory the connection eld would lie in a q-algebra rather than a
lie algebra. the associated fock space would then be the direct product of the standard
fock space generated by a and the q-fock space generated by . if yang-mills theories
describe point particles, then q-yang-mills theories describe particles with internal degrees
of freedom.
