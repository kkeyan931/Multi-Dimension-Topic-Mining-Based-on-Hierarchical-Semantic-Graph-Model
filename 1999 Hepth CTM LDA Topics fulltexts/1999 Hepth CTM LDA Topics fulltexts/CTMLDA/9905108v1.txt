abstract

the supereld models with the partial spontaneous breaking of the global d=3,
n =2 supersymmetry are discussed. the abelian gauge model describes the low-
energy interactions of the real scalar eld with the 3d vector and fermion elds.
we introduce the new goldstone-maxwell representation of the 3d gauge supereld
and show that the partial spontaneous breaking n =2  n =1 is possible for the
non-minimal self-interaction of this modied gauge supereld including the linear
fayet-iliopoulos term. the dual description of the partial breaking in the model
of the self-interacting goldstone chiral supereld is also considered. these models
have the constant vacuum solutions and describe, respectively, the interactions of the
n =1 goldstone multiplets of the d2-brane or supermembrane with the additional
massive multiplets.

1 introduction

standard mechanisms of spontaneous breaking of the global d=4, n=1 supersymmetry
(sbgs) are connected with the constant vacuum solutions for the auxiliary components
of chiral and gauge superelds (see reviews [1]-[3]). the constant sbgs solutions are
possible in the very restrictive class of the self-interacting models of chiral superelds. in
particular, sbgs is not possible for the non-trivial self-interaction of the single chiral
supereld. the fayet-iliopoulos (f i) mechanism consists in adding the linear term to
the action of the n=1 abelian gauge theory, however, this term does not guarantee auto-
matically the appearance of the sbgs-solution for any gauge-matter interaction. these
standard mechanisms are not very exible, so the search of new approaches to this prob-
lem is desirable, especially for the extended supersymmetry or supersymmetries in low
dimensions which have some specic features. the problems of the spontaneous breaking
of local supersymmetries will not be discussed in this paper.

the standard linear supermultiplets (standard superelds) are not convenient for the
description of the partial spontaneous breaking of the exended global supersymmetries
(p sbgs) when the invariance with respect to the part of supercharges remains unbro-
ken.
in particular, the constant solutions with a degenerate structure of the auxiliary
elds are forbidden in many cases. the goldstone-fermion models with the partial spon-
taneous breaking of the d=4, n=2 [4] and d=3, n=2 [5] supersymmetries have been
constructed using the topologically non-trivial classical solutions preserving the one half of

supercharges. these models have been also studied in the method of nonlinear realizations
of supersymmetries [6]-[11] using superelds of the unbroken supersymmetry.

recently the abelian gauge model with two f i-terms have been used to break sponta-
neously d=4, n=2 supersymmetry to its n=1 subgroup [12]-[14]. this model describes
the non-minimal interactions of the complex scalar eld with the fermion and u(1)-gauge
eld.
in the d=4, n=2 superspace these interactions correspond to the holomorphic
action of the chiral supereld w satisfying the supereld constraints modied by the con-
stant terms in comparison to the original constraints of the n=2 vector multiplet [15].
this constraint guarantees the appearance of the unusual constant imaginary part in the
isovector auxiliary component of the the goldstone-maxwell supereld which contains
also the goldstone fermion component.

the more early example of the goldstone-type constraint has been considered in the
model with the partial breaking of the d=1, n=4 supersymmetry [16]. thus, these
constraints introduce a new type of the supersymmetry representations with the linear
goldstone (lg) fermions. in distinction with the goldstone fermions of the nonlinear
realizations which transforms linearly only in the unbroken supersymmetry, lg-fermions
have their partners in the supermultiplets of the whole supersymmetry. we shall consider
the interactions of lg-superelds in the d=3, n=2 supersymmetry and show that these
models solve the problem of p sbgs for the vector multiplet and the corresponding dual
scalar multiplet. recently these problems have been considered in the framework of the
n=1 superspace [11].

the coordinates of the full d=3, n=2 superspace are

z = (x, , ) ,

(1.1)

where ,  are the spinor indices of the group sl(2, r), and the spinor representation
of the coordinate is connected with the vector representation via the 3d -matrices
x=(1/2)xm(m). the algebra of spinor derivatives in this superspace has the fol-
lowing form:

{d, d} = i + iz ,
{d, d} = 0 ,

{ d, d} = 0 ,

where z is the real central charge and

where [x, y } is the graded commutator and p(x) = 1 is the z2-parity. the action of
the dierential operator x on some function f (z) and the corresponding conjugation are
dened as follows:

(1.18)
(remark that the alternative convention of conjugation (xf ) = (1)p(x)p(f )x f  is also
possible.)

(1.27)

the d=3, n=2 gauge theories have been considered, for instance, in ref.[17, 18]. the
non-minimal self-interaction of the u(1) gauge supermultiplet in this case is equivalent to
the interaction of the 3d linear multiplet. we shall analyse the modied lgm-constraints
for the 3d gauge multiplet. the corresponding real 3d supereld describes the scalar
eld interacting with the goldstone fermions and the vector eld.

in sect.4 we discuss the prepotential solution for the (lgm) supermultiplet which con-
tains additional terms manifestly depending on the spinor coordinates and some complex
constants which play the role of moduli in the vacuum state of the theory together with
the constant of the f i-term. using this representation in the non-minimal gauge action
one can obtain the constant vacuum solutions with the partial spontaneous breaking of
the d=3, n=2 supersymmetry. note that the supersymmetry algebra is modied on
the lgm prepotential v by analogy with the similar modied transformations of the 4d
gauge elds or prepotentials in refs.[13, 14].

the sect.5 is devoted to the description of the p sbgs in the interaction of the lg-
chiral supereld which is dual to the interaction of the lgm supereld. this manifestly
supersymmetric action depends on the sum of the chiral and antichiral superelds and
some constant term bilinear in the spinor coordinates. the non-usual transformation of
the basic lg-chiral supereld satises the supersymmetry algebra with the central-charge
term.

the n=1 supermembrane and d2-brane actions [11] can be analysed in our approach
using the decompositions of n=2 superelds in the 2-nd spinor coordinate 
2 . in sect.6, we
consider the n=1 components of the extended superelds and the covariant conditions
which allow us to express the additional degrees of freedom in terms of the goldstone
superelds.

2 vector multiplet in d=3, n =2 supersymmetry

the d=3, n=2 gauge theory [17, 18] is analogous to the well-known d=4, n=1 gauge
theory, although the three-dimensional case has some interesting peculiarities which are
connected with the existence of the topological mass term and duality between the 3d-
vector and chiral multiplets. we shall consider the basic superspace with z=0.

the abelian u(1)-gauge prepotential v (z) possesses the gauge transformation

v =  +  ,

where the chiral and anti-chiral parameters are considered
d  = 0 .

d = 0 ,

the d=3, n=2 vector multiplet is described by the real linear supereld

w (v ) = i(d d)v

4

(2.1)

(2.2)

(2.3)

satisfying the basic constraints

(d)2w = ( d)2w = 0 .

the additional useful relations for this supereld have the following form:

d(d d)w = 
(d d)2w =

1
8

i
2

dw ,

(  id)w .

(2.4)

(2.5)

(2.6)

the components of the vector multiplet can be calculated as the =0 parts of basic

superelds and their spinor derivatives

(x) = w|0 = i(d d)v |0 ,
 =  dw|0 ,
f = dw|0 ,

a = dv )|0 ,
g = i(d d)w|0 ,

 = (dw )|0 ,

(2.7)
(2.8)
(2.9)

where a and f are the 3d-vector eld and its eld-strength , g is the real auxiliary
component and ,  and  are the physical scalar and spinor elds. the scalar eld
appears as the 3d analog of the 3-rd component of the 4d gauge eld.

the low-energy eective action of the 3d vector multiplet describes a non-minimal
interaction of the real scalar eld with the fermion and gauge elds [19]. for the u(1)
gauge supereld v this action has the following general form:

s(w ) = 

1

2 z d7zh(w ) ,

 (w ) = h (w ) > 0 ,

(2.10)

where h(w ) is the real convex function of w . note that the action conserves the ur(1)
invariance.

the interesting feature of the 3d gauge theory is the existence of the chern-simons

term [17]

scs =

ik

4 z d7zv (d d)v ,

(2.11)

where k is some constant. the component form of this action contains the the topological
gauge term r d3xa
 a. note that the non-abelian generalization of this term has
been constructed in ref.[18].

the 3d linear multiplet is dual to the chiral multiplet . the legendre transform

describing this duality is

s[b, ] = 

1

2 z d7z[h(b)  b] ,

(2.12)

where b is the real unconstrained supereld and = + . varying the lagrange multi-
pliers  and  one can obtain the constraints (2.4).
using the solution of the algebraic b-equation

h (b)  f (b) = 

(2.13)

5

one can pass to the self-interaction of the chiral superelds

s() = 
h() = h[b()]  b() ,

.

the corresponding supereld equation of motion is

( d)2 h () =  ()( d)2  +

1
2

 () d d   = 0 .

(2.18)

this chiral model describes the special case of the kahler supersymmetric -model
which is completely determined by the real function h and possesses by construction the
additional abelian isometry

   + i ,

(2.19)

where  is some real parameter.

3 diculties with spontaneous breaking of super-

symmetry

let us consider the spontaneous breaking of supersymmetry in the non-minimal gauge
model (2.10) with the additional linear f i-term

sf i =

1
2

 z d7zv ,

(3.1)

where  is a constant of the dimension 1. varying the supereld v one can derive the
corresponding supereld equation of motion

 i(d d)h (w ) +  = i (w )(d d)w 

i
2

 (w )dw dw +  = 0 ,

(3.2)

where

 (w ) = h (w ) ,

 (w ) = h (w ) .

(3.3)

the spinor derivatives of this supereld equation generate the component equations

of motion of dierent dimension

  dw (d)2w = 0 , (3.4)

where the last term vanishes due to the constraint (2.4). the vacuum solutions can be
analysed with the help of the equation

(d d)2h (w ) = 0 .

(3.5)

6

we shall study the constant solutions of the equation of motion using the following

vacuum ansatz:

v0 = 2i( )a  2()2()2g ,

w0 = a + 2i( )g ,

(3.6)

where a and g are constants. the lowest vacuum components of the equations (3.2) and
(3.5) read

g (a)   = 0 ,
g2 (a) = 0 .

the non-trivial solution g06=0 is possible for the quadratic function h only.

it is useful to consider the real 3d spinors 

i = 
i

 =

1
2

(

1 + i
2 )

and corresponding real spinor parameters of the n=2 supersymmetry

 =

1
2

(

1 + i

2 ) .

(3.7)
(3.8)

(3.9)

(3.10)

it is clear that the constant solution (3.6) can only break spontaneously both super-

symmetries

 = ig0 ,

 = ig0

(3.11)

since it generates two real goldstone fermions.

thus, the full spontaneous breakdown of the n=2 supersymmetry is possible only for
the free theory with the w 2(v )-interaction and the f i term. the partial spontaneous
breaking is forbidden if one uses the vector multiplet satisfying the standard constraint
(2.4).

let us estimate the role of the cern-simons term (2.11) in the vacuum equations.

varying the action s(w ) + scs + sf i one can obtain the modied equation of motion

 i(d d)h  + kw +  = 0 .

this supereld equation produces the following modied vacuum equations:

g (a)  ka   = 0 ,
g2 (a)  kg = 0 .

the scalar potential of this model is

vk(a) =

1

2 (a)

( + ka)2 .

(3.12)

(3.13)
(3.14)

(3.15)

for the arbitrary function  >  (a) > 0 this potential has the unique manifestly
supersymmetric minimum a = k1. thus, even the free sbgs solution  = const
disappears in the presence of the cs-term.

4 partial spontaneous breakdown of supersymmetry

we shall dene the modied goldstone-type constraints for the 3d vector multiplet by
the analogy with refs.[16, 14] and show that the partial spontaneous breaking of the
d=3, n=2 supersymmetry is possible for the non-trivial gauge interaction in the frame-
work of this approach.

consider the following deformation of the constraints (2.4):

(d)2 w = c ,

( d)2 w = c ,

(4.1)

where c and c are some constants. these relations break manifestly the ur(1) invariance.

the solution of these constraints can be constructed by analogy with eq.(2.3)

w = i(d d)v + ()2c + ()2 c .

(4.2)

this lgm supereld contains new constant auxiliary structures which change radically
the matrix of the vacuum fermion transformations

 = c + ig ,
 = ig  c .

(4.3)
(4.4)

it is evident that the p sbgs-condition corresponds to the degeneracy of these trans-

formations

c c  g2 = 0 .

(4.5)

in this case one can choose the single real goldstone spinor eld as some linear combination
of 
i . for the case of the pure imaginary constant c the lg fermion can be identied
with 
2 .

it should be stressed that the shifted quantity w (v ) = i(d d)v in eq.(4.2) is not a

standard supereld

(4.6)

the algebra of these transformations is not changed on the gauge-invariant supereld

[1, 2]w (v ) = 0 .

(4.7)

the transformation of the lgm-prepotential v will be considered in the end of this
section.

the action of the lgm-supereld (4.2) has the following form:

s(v ) = 

1

2 z d7z[h( w )  v ]

and depends on three constants , c and c.

the non-derivative terms in the component lagrangian

the vacuum equations of this model are

g (a)   = 0 ,
(g2  |c|2) (a) = 0 .

(4.10)

(4.11)
(4.12)

the p sbgs solution (4.5) arises for the non-trivial interaction  (a)6=0. this solution

determines the minimum point a0 of this model

||(a0) = ||
|c|

.

the vacuum auxiliary eld can be calculated in the point a0

g0 =



 (a0)

= |c| .

(4.13)

(4.14)

using the ur(1) transformation one can choose the pure imaginary constant c  c = i|c|
without the loss of generality then

this choice corresponds to the following decomposition of the lgm-supereld 4.2)

g0 = ic = |c| .

w = ws(vs) + 2i|c|(22) ,
ws(vs) =

(d1d1

i

(4.16)

(4.17)

where vs is the shifted lgm-prepotential which has the vanishing vacuum solution for
the auxiliary component. it is evident that this representation breaks spontaneously the
2-nd supersymmetry only.

let us consider now the supersymmetry transformations of ws and vs

(4.25)

the additional generators belong to the innite lie algebra of the u(1)-gauge transfor-
mations which arises in the (x, )-decomposition of the chiral gauge parameters  (2.1).
these generators vanish on the gauge invariant quantity ws. one should also include in
the modied n=2 supersymmetry algebra all nontrivial commutators of the t generators
with the spinor generators qk
.

consider the spinor gauge connection

a(z) = dvs ,

a = d

(4.26)

in the chiral representation ( a=0). the inhomogeneous term in the modied supersym-
metry transformation of this gauge supereld has the following form:

(4.27)

it should be remarked that the minimal interaction of the charged chiral superelds
with the lgm-prepotential vs breaks the supersymmetry. the analogous problem of
the lgm interaction with the charged matter appears also in the p sbgs model with
d=4, n=2 supersymmetry [14].

5 the 3d chiral interaction with the partial breaking

the general eective action of the chiral superelds i (i is some internal index) can be
written as follows:

z d4xd4k(k, k) + [z d4xd2p (i) + c.c.] ,

(5.1)

where k is the kahler potential and p is the chiral supereld potential.

the existence of the non-trivial sbgs solution implies the degeneracy of the matrix
ikp . the vacuum equation for the single chiral supereld  may have the non-vanishing
sbgs solution only in the trivial case of the linear function p () and the free kahler
potential k =  .

we shall show that the spontaneous breaking of supersymmetry is possible for the
non-trivial interaction of the lg chiral supereld which possesses the inhomogeneous
supersymmetry transformation. let us consider the dual picture for the p sbgs gauge
model with the f i-term (4.8)

s(b, , ) =

2 z d7z[h(b)  b ]

where the modied constrained lg supereld is introduced

   +  + 2i( ) ,

(d d)  = i .

(5.3)

varying the chiral and antichiral lagrange multipliers  and  one can obtain the
lgm-constraints (4.2) on the supereld b and then pass to the gauge phase b  w (v )
where the ( )-term in  transforms to the f i-term.

the algebraic b-equation

h (b)  f (b) =  ,

provides the transform to the chiral phase

the transformed chiral action is

(5.6)

(5.7)

it should be remarked that the linear terms with c and c break the ur(1)-symmetry
(1.6), however, this action is invariant with respect to the isometry transformation (2.19).
it should be underlined that the lg-supereld  transforms homogeneously, while
the supersymmetry transformation of the lg-chiral lagrange multiplier  contains the
inhomogeneous term

 = i() + i

(5.8)
the action s is invariant with respect to the lg representation of the n=2 supersym-
metry, since the 1-st term of this action depends manifestly on the covariant supereld ,
and the 2-nd one is invariant due to the linear -dependence of the inhomogeneous term

thus, the goldstone boson eld im a(x) for the central-charge transformation appears in
this model. it should be remarked that the isometry transformation (2.19) in the chiral
model without p sbgs cannot be identied with the central charge.

the vacuum solution |f0|2 = 2 corresponds to the degeneracy condition for these
thus, the non-trivial interaction of the lg-chiral supereld  provides the partial
spontaneous breaking of the d=3, n=2 supersymmetry. this phenomenon has been
analysed also in the formalism of the d=3, n=1 goldstone-type superelds [11].

the analogous transformations of n=1 superelds have been proposed in ref.[11].
the authors of this work have shown that the additional supereld can be constructed in
terms of the spinor derivative of the goldstone supereld  in order to built the super-
membrane action. the massive degrees of freedom in our approach can be removed using
the covariant condition

2 = 0 ,

(6.16)

which allows us to construct  via d1
d=4, n=2 theory [10].

 by analogy with the similar construction in the

note that these integrals, including the linear in  term, are invariant with respect to the
n=2 supersymmetry transformations (6.14,6.15).

let us analyse the n=1 decomposition of the gauge prepotential

vs(x, 1, 2) = (x, 1) + i

(6.20)

and the chiral gauge parameter

the spinor supereld strength f is analogous to the goldstone spinor supereld of
ref.[11]. it describes the goldstone degree of freedom of the d2-brane, and the supereld
w corresponds to the massive degrees of freedom. our construction introduces the n=1
gauge supereld v as the basic object of this model and allows us to study the modica-
tion of the supersymmetry algebra on the gauge elds of the d2-brane. it is not dicult
to rewrite the n=2 action (4.8) in terms of the n=1 superelds.
