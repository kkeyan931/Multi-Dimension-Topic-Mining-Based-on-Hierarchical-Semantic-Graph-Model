abstract

motivated by a system consisting of a number of parallel m5-branes, we study
possible local deformations of a chiral two-form in six dimensions. working to
rst order in the coupling constant, this reduces to the study of the local brst
cohomological group at ghost number zero. we obtain an exhaustive list of all
possible deformations. none of them allows for a satisfactory formulation of
the m5-branes system leading to the conclusion that no local eld theory can
describe such a system.

the m5-brane is perhaps the most elusive object in m-theory [1]. in the limit

where bulk gravity decouples, it is described by a six-dimensional eld theory.
in
order to match the eight propagating fermionic degrees of freedom, its bosonic sector

has to include, besides the ve scalar elds which describe the position of the brane
in transverse space, a chiral two-form transforming as the (3,1) of the little group

su(2)  su(2). the latter reects that m2-branes may end on m5-branes. the
resulting theory is an n = (2, 0) superconformal eld theory in six dimensions [2].

a single m5 brane with strong classical elds is well understood; its lagrangian is

described in [3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. however, when several, say n, m5-branes coincide, little is
known. compactifying one dimension of m-theory on a circle yields type iia string

theory. if the m5-branes are taken transversal to the compact direction, they become
n coinciding ns5-branes in type iia, again a poorly understood system. however, if

the branes are longitudinal to the compact direction, the m5-branes appear as a set of
coinciding d4-branes which are quite well understood. their dynamics is governed by

a ve-dimensional u(n) born-infeld theory which, ignoring higher derivative terms, is
an ordinary u(n) non-abelian gauge theory. turning back to the eleven dimensional
picture, this suggests that a non-abelian extension of the chiral two-form should exist.

however, there are several indications that this is a highly unusual system. both
entropy considerations [8, 9] and the calculation of the conformal anomaly of the
partition function [10] show that the theory should have n3 instead of n2 degrees of

1

freedom. in [11] it was argued on geometric grounds, that for p > 1, non-chiral p-forms

do not allow for non-abelian extensions. in [12], geometric prejudices were dropped,
and general deformations of non-chiral p-forms were classied to rst order in the

coupling constant. though both known and novel deformations were discovered, none
of them had the required property that the p-form gauge algebra becomes genuinely

non-abelian.

in the present letter we will specically focus on deformations of chiral two-forms
in six dimensions. we will ignore the fermions and the scalar elds as we believe that

they will not modify our conclusions. in fact this can easily be proven for the scalar
elds because they are inert under the two-form gauge symmetry.

our starting point is the action of [13],

the action (1) may be covariantized by adding appropriate auxiliary and gauge
elds. one gets in this manner the free action of [6]. conversely, one may fall back

on (1) by partly gauge-xing the pst lagrangian. thus a consistent deformation of

2

the pst lagrangian denes a consistent deformation of (1). though the action (1)

is signicantly simpler to handle than the pst lagrangian, we pay the price that our
analysis is not manifestly lorentz invariant. without enforcing lorentz invariance,

we will already obtain strong constraints on the allowed deformations. we shall come
back to lorentz invariance at the end of this letter.

our strategy for studying the possible local deformations of the action (1) is based
on the observation that these are in bijective correpondence with the local brst
cohomological group h 0,6(s|d) [14], where s is the brst dierential acting on the
elds, the ghosts, and their conjugate antields, d is the ordinary space-time exterior
derivative and the upper indices refer to ghost number and form degree resp. in the

present case, s is given by

ij]  s[aa

any solution of (15) denes a consistent deformation of the action (1) through
s[aa
ij] + g r d6xa0, where a0 is the antield-independent component of a.
the deformation is consistent to rst-order in g, in the sense that one can simultane-
ously deform the original gauge symmetry (6) in such a way that the deformed action
is invariant under the deformed gauge symmetry up to terms of order g (included).

the antield-dependent components of a contain informations about the deforma-
tion of the gauge symmetry. trivial solutions of (15) are of the form a = c + de and

correspond to a0s that can be redened away through eld redenitions. of course,

3

there are also consistency conditions on the deformations arising from higher-order
terms (g2 and higher), but it turns out that in the case at hand, consistency to rst
order already restricts dramatically the possibilities.

there are three possible types of consistent deformations of the action. first,
one may deform the action without modifying the gauge symmetry. in that case, a

does not depend on the antields, a = a0. these deformations contain only strictly
gauge-invariant terms, i.e., polynomials in the abelian curvatures and their derivatives
(born-infeld terms are in this category) as well as chern-simons terms, which are

(o-shell) gauge-invariant under the abelian gauge symmetry up to a total derivative.
an example of a chern-simons term is given by the kinetic term of (1), which can
be rewritten as f  0a (in writing chern-simons terms, the spatial 2-forms aa
and their successive time derivatives, which are also spatial 2-forms, are eectively

independent). second, one may deform the action and the gauge transformations
while keeping their algebra invariant.
in brst terms, the corresponding cocycles
involve (non trivially) the antields aaij but not c ai or  a. finally, one may
deform everything, including the gauge algebra; the corresponding cocycles involve
all the antields.

reformulating the problem of deforming the free action (1) in terms of brst
cohomology enables one to use the powerful tools of homological algebra. following

the approach of [12], we have completely worked out the brst cohomogical classes
at ghost number zero.
in particular, we have established that one can always get

rid of the antields by adding trivial solutions. in other words, the only consistent
interactions for a system of chiral 2-forms in six dimensions are (up to redenitions)

deformations that do not modify the gauge symmetries (6) of the free theory. these
involve the abelian curvatures or chern-simons terms. there are no other consistent,
local, deformations.

we shall give the detailed proof of this assertion in a separate publication [15]. we
shall just outline here the general skeleton of the proof, which parallels the analysis

of [16, 12] rather closely, emphasizing only the new features.

to nd the general solution of (15), one expands a according to the antields, i.e.,

more precisely, according to the antighost number,

a = a0 + a1 +    + ak, antigh(ai) = i.

(16)

the only variables with non-vanishing antighost number are the antields, with
antigh(aaij) = 1, antigh(c ai) = 2 and antigh( a) = 3. a similar expansion
holds for b. the fact that k remains nite follows from demanding locality in the
sense that the number of derivatives in both the deformations of the action and in
the deformations of the gauge transformations remains nite [16]. what we must

4

show is that one can eliminate all the terms in (16) but the antield-independent

component a0. so, let us assume k > 0 and nite.

the last term in the expansion (16) must fulll ak + dbk = 0 from (15). as in the
non-chiral case, one may assume bk = 0 through redenitions (k > 0). thus, ak = 0
and one must determine the general cocycle of the -dierential. it is here that there

0 = 0a. in the chiral case, however, there is no ghost c a

is a dierence with the non-chiral case. indeed, the time derivatives of the ghosts of
ghosts a are now in the -cohomology, while they are trivial in the non-chiral case,
where one has c a
0 , so
0a is a non-trivial -cocycle (at ghost number two). a similar property holds for
the higher-order time derivatives of a. one easily veries that these are the only
generators of the -cohomology at positive ghost number. the other generators of the
cohomology are the curvatures, the antields and their spacetime derivatives. thus,
up to trivial terms that can be absorbed, one may write the last term ak in (16) as

ak = xi

p ii

(17)

where (i) the p i are 6-forms constructed out of the antields, the curvatures, their
spacetime derivatives and the dxs; and (ii) the i are a basis of the vector space
of polynomials in the ghosts of ghosts a and their successive time-derivatives. fur-
themore, antigh(p i) = antigh(ak) = k (by assumption) and gh(i) = k so that
gh(ak) = gh(i)  antigh(p i) = 0. this shows that k must be even since the as
and their successive time-derivatives have even ghost number. thus, ik k is odd, ak
is trivial and can be entirely removed.

turn now to the next equation following from (15),

ak1 + ak + dbk1 = 0

(18)

by following the same line of thought as for non-chiral systems [16], and using in

addition an argument based on counting time-derivatives of the ghosts of ghosts, one
easily proves that p i must take the form p i = qi dx0 (up to trivial terms), where qi is
a spatial 5-form (polynomial of degree 5 in the spatial dxks) solution of qi + dri = 0.
here, d is the spatial exterior derivative, d  kdxk. furthermore, in order for (17)
to be non-trivial, qi must be a non-trivial solution, i.e., not of the form m i + dn i.
the analysis of [12] imply that there are non-trivial solutions of qi + dri = 0 only
for antigh(qi) = 1 or 3. in particular, all solutions of qi + dri = 0 are trivial in
even ghost number, which is the relevant case for us since antigh(qi ) = antigh(p i).
there is therefore no way to match the odd antighost number of non-trivial solutions
of qi + dri = 0 with the even ghost number of i in order to make a non-trivial
ak. thus, ak is trivial and can be removed. the same argument applies then to the
successive ak1, ak2 ... and we can conclude that indeed, up to trivial terms, a can be

5

taken not to depend on the antields, a = a0. the only consistent interactions in six

dimensions do not deform the gauge symmetry and are either strictly gauge-invariant
(a0 = 0), or gauge-invariant up to a total derivative (a0 + db0 = 0)1.

because they do not deform the gauge-symmetry, the o-shell gauge-invariant
(up to a possible total derivative) interactions are clearly consistent to all orders,

so there is no further constraint following from gauge invariance. if one imposes in
addition lorentz-invariance, then, one gets of course additional restrictions on the
gauge-invariant interactions. in the case where the lagrangian is required to involve

only rst-order derivatives of the elds, these restrictions are most easily analysed by
using the dirac-schwinger criterion, which easily leads to the perry-schwarz condition

[3] on the hamiltonian in the case of a single eld [18]. we have, however, not done
it explicitly for a system with many chiral 2-forms2. the dirac-schwinger criterion
also implies consistent gravitational coupling of the chiral 2-forms [13, 18].

the present analysis clearly leads to the conclusion that all deformations yield

abelian algebras. in other words, no local eld theory can describe a system of n co-
inciding m5-branes. this leaves of course the non-local deformations of the abelian
theory. proposals in this direction exist [21, 22] where the two-form is used to con-

struct a connection on the principal bundle based on the space of loops with a common
point. however, this approach requires the introduction of a one-form potential which

is used to parallel transport the two-form from the common point to some point on
the loop. such a one-form potential doesnt seem to appear in the m5-system. a way

out would be to constrain the potentials to be at, but even then one nds that also
here the algebra remains an abelian one. finally, three-form eld-strengths and their

two-form potentials nd a natural geometrical setting in the context of gerbes [23].
however, there as well, a non-abelian extension of the two-form gauge-symmetry is
still lacking.

1a similar result holds for non-chiral 2-forms in six dimensions, for which the only symmety-
deforming consistent interactions are the freedman-townsend interactions [17, 12], but these are
available in four dimensions only).

2the dirac-schwinger criterion is also useful for the related problem of manifestly duality-
invariant formulations of electromagnetism in 4 dimensions [19] and reproduces there the condition
of [20].
