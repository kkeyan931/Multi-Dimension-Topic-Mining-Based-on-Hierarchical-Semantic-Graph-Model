(322) parameter drops equations except non-commutative curvature (322). result, expansion powers equivalent expansion powers curvature uctuations. now, one observes limiting case = 0 system (321), (322) reduces free one. indeed, setting b|=0 = b1 c , w|=0 = w0 w , s|=0 = s0 , (323) see = 0 system (321), (322) solves terms = s0 gauge eld w = w(y(); 1,2, k|x) satisfying vacuum equations dw = w w, b = c(y(); 1,2, k|x) satisfying free eld equations (289). similar contractions lie algebras. values 6= 0, systems equations (321), (322) pairwise equivalent since eld redenition (320) non-degenerate. hand, although eld redenition (320) degenerates = 0, eqs. (321), (322) still make sense = 0, describing free eld dynamics. remarkably, two inequivalent systems turn related following ow respect : w b = (1 ) b = (1 ) b = (1 ) b w b + w b , + + b b , b , (324) (325) (326) arbitrary parameter. applying sides eqs.(321), (322) one concludes system (324)-(326) com- patible (321), (322). therefore, solving (324)-(326) initial data (323) satisfying free equations motion express solutions full nonlinear system = 1 via solutions free system = 0. note elds acquire nontrivial dependence parameter via deformed oscillators (282) (283). approach ecient least perturbatively allows one derive corresponding nonlinear eld redenitions order order. par- ticular, using ow, one easily proves 34 d3 higher spin gauge eld strengths admit nontrivial sources linear elds. course expected result because, accordance d3 central on-mass-shell 69 theorem (183), d3 higher spin elds admit weyl tensors. neverthe- less, even linearized level complicated technical problem nd form appropriate eld redenition arbitrary without using ow (324)-(326). ows (324)-(326) dierent develop within gauge equiv- alence class. see variation induced gauge transfor- mation one nd gauge parameter w = , b =  , =  , |=0 = 0 , (327) = . compatibility condition (327) (324)- (326) satised = b + (1 ) b + b , (328) condition xes -dependence . thus, one free choose value . one careful making statements locality mapping induced ow (324)-(326). indeed, although contain explic- itly space-time derivatives, contains implicitly via highest components c(n) generating function c(y) identied highest derivatives matter elds according (189). example, equation (325) = 0 zero order reads b1(z, y) = c(y) c(y) . (329) nonlocality star-product, xed rank multispinorial component left hand side formula appears, general, innite series involving bilinear combinations components c(n) n right hand side (329). therefore, accordance (190), right hand side (329) eectively involves space-time derivatives orders, i.e. transformation laws (324)-(326) eectively describe nonlocal transformation. means cannot treat system (321), (322) locally equivalent free system. instead claim exists nonlocal mapping free nonlinear system. mapping reminiscent nicolai mapping supersymmetric models 66. linearized level, however, transformations induced inte- grating ow (324)-(326) local following simple reason. case, eld redenitions linear matter elds c zero-order 70 (vacuum) part w0 higher spin gauge elds w contributes. since background gravitational 1-forms (131) bilinear auxiliary variables y, transformations physical elds, induced (324), contain two derivatives y. accordance (190), equivalent state- ment linearized eld transformations contain nite number space-time derivatives therefore local. thus, fact equa- tions motion higher spin elds acquire sources linear matter elds well-dened local statement. expected true second-order analysis bilinear higher spin currents constructed matter elds. fact, 2-forms j(c) dual currents arbitrary spin constructed massless matter elds ads3 shown 26 exact j(c) = du (c) (330) class innite expansions powers derivatives (i.e. u (c) depending components c(y )), thus explaining nonlocal eld redenition induced ow (324)-(326) compensate higher spin current interactions matter elds r1 dw = j(c) . (331) let us stress phenomenon analog space. existence integrating ow (324) takes origin simple fact b behaves like constant system (208)-(212): commutes satises covariant constancy condition. knowledge vacuum solution b = therefore used reconstruct full dependence b. indeed, meaning (324) derivative respect b respect . since parameter interpreted coupling constant, idea integrate higher spin equations integrating ow respect much common coupling constant evolution method developed 67 application quantum mechanics. one proceed analogously d=4 case substitution (332) (238) or, equivalently, reintroducing nonzero f0 = f0 = . leads two ows commuting system (208) other, f (b) = + f (b) , f (b) = + f (b) x x = (1 ) f (b) x + = (1 ) f(b) 71 x + x f (b) , x f (b) (333) (334) x = w , b. rst sight existence d=4 ows paradoxical establishes connection full nonlinear problem free system vacuum elds sector gauge elds w . ne chern-simons d=3 higher spin dynamics sounds surprisingly d=4 case. indeed, let us discuss example einstein gravity. einstein equations (155), (156) rewritten r 1 2 c1212 , = h 1 h r = 0, r12 = h1 h2 2 c 1 2 1 2 , (335) parameter introduced way comes system (208)- (212). limit = 0, einstein equations therefore reduce vacuum equations ads space. dynamical equations massless spin 2 eld reappear equations weyl tensor described covariant constancy equation (158) (159), (equivalently (209)). understand free vacuum system related nonlinear one 6= 0, one take account dierence d=3 d=4 problems discussed end section 5. d=3, ansatz (131) describes vacuum solution ads3 gravitational elds (x) h(x) arbitrary . therefore, dierentiation respect d=3 case using ow iterate solutions act deformed oscillators (282) (283) space-time dependent coecients (131) identied background gravitational elds. result, implementation integration ow d=3 form (may eectively nonlocal) eld redenition. d=4 ansatz (132) describes ads geometry case = = 0. 6= 0 solve vacuum equations. therefore, d=4 case one rst nd true vacuum solution w0(, ) problem 6= 0 6= 0, w0(0, 0) reduces ads4 solution. fact (132) inconsistent away = = 0 follows dependence space-time coordinates xn spinor coordinates z mixed nontrivially vacuum solution. |=0 express directly via ads4 gravitational elds identied w0(x)|=0 case d=3. result, d=4 ow describes change variables explicitly containing functions space-time coordinates (via w0(x) ), depend particular gauge choice cannot directly expressed via background gravitational elds. therefore, d=4, integration ow generates eld redenition change variables containing explicit dependence space-time coordinates. d=4 eld transform induced ow nonlocal even linearized level. conclusion particular, w0(x) 72 therefore ows (333), (334) indeed allow one solve nonlinear system terms free system via expansion form w = w0 + 1(x)c + 22(x)c2 + . . .
