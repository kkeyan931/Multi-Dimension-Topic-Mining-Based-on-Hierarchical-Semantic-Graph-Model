we formulate the renormalization procedure using the domain wall regularization that is
based on the heat-kernel method. the quantum eects of both fermions and bosons (gauge
elds) are taken into account. the background eld method is quite naturally introduced.
with regard to the treatment of the loop-momentum integrals, an interesting contrast be-
tween the fermion-determinant part and other parts is revealed. these points are elucidated
by considering some examples. the weyl anomalies for 2d qed and 4d qed are correctly
obtained. it is found that the chiral solution produces (1/2)d/2  correct values, where d
is the spatial dimension. considering the model of 2d qed, both weyl and chiral anomalies
are directly obtained from the eective action. the mass and wave function renormalization
are explicitly performed in 4d qed. we conrm the multiplicative (not additive) renormal-
ization, which demonstrates the advantage of no ne-tuning. the relation with the recently
popular higher-dimensional approach, such as the randall- sundrum model, is commented
on.

1.

introduction

in the lattice world, it appears as if a new era is about to begin. 1), 2) the
so-called doubling problem has become claried, and the chirality of fermions
can be controlled more eciently than before. we may say a new regularization
has been established in the lattice.
in accordance with these great developments
, the counterpart in the continuum is progressing. 3) - 7) there are two merits to
such an approach. first, we can clearly understand the essential part of the new
regularization, which is often hidden in the complexity of the discretized model.
second, we can compare the new regularization with the ordinary ones used to this
time and apply it to various (continuum) eld theories. the continuum version, at
least, should explain the qualitative features of the lattice domain wall.

in the domain wall approach used to now, at least in the continuum approach,
the gauge eld in the fermion determinant is treated mainly as an external eld.
(for lattice model analysis, the gauge eld quantum eect was examined, and the
renormalizability was checked at the 1-loop level in ref. 8).) clearly, the situation is
not satisfactory, because the gauge eld is not treated as a quantum eld and the
general perspective regarding its use in (perturbative) quantum eld theory has not
been presented. of course, the fermion determinant could be the most important

among the other parts, but we must formulate the gauge eld within the general
setting in order to regard it as a new regularization in the eld theory. this is what
motivates the present work.

recently, a new treatment has appeared in the continuum approach. 9), 10) the
main idea is the following. the (regularization) ambiguity and the divergences of the
fermion determinant can be resolved by introducing a direction into the system.
this is based on an analogy to the well-dened determinant of the elliptic operator,
which can be expressed in the form of a heat equation solution. here we recall two
facts: 1) the heat propagates in a xed direction, that is, from high temperature
to low temperature (as stipulated by the second law of the thermodynamics) and,
generally, the heat equation describes such behaviour; 2) the famous procedure of
introducing the heat equation into a general quantum system is the heat-kernel
method. 11) the fermion determinant is very often examined using this method.
(the anomaly is formulated from this point of view in ref. 12).) we have shown
that the above idea works well if we consider the 4 dimensional theory from the 1+4
dimensional space-time.

we summarize this new treatment in 2. new results regarding 2d and 4d
in 3, the renormalization procedure is
qed weyl anomalies are also presented.
introduced, and the (renormalized) eective action itself is used to derive anomalies.
at this stage, we still keep the gauge eld external, in order to make the explanation
simple. in 4, we introduce the background eld method 13), 14) and take into account
the quantum eect of the gauge eld as well as that of the fermion. we do the
renormalization of the fermion self-energy explicitly. in 5, we present the complete
formulation, combining the results of 3 and 4. finally, we point out that the
domain wall regularization treats the fermion determinant part distinctly from the
other parts.

and they satisfy the heat equations with the rst derivative operator i5( d + im ).
we call g5m
 the (+)-domain and (-)-domain, because in the extreme
chiral limit (dened below) they have exponential distributions in the extra t-space,
peaked at t = 0 or t = . ). the key observation is that the heat equations turn
out to be the 1+4 dimensional minkowski dirac equation after appropriate wick
rotations for t. for the system of 4 dimensional euclidean qed, d = i( +

the above solution based on another key observation that the system should have a
xed direction [regularization prescription 2]. generally, the solution of (4) is
given by two ingredients (see a standard textbook, for example, ref. 15)), 1) a free
solution g0(x, y ), and 2) a propagator s(x, y ) in the following form:

g5

(5)

this gives us the solution g5
m (x, y ) perturbatively with respect to the coupling
e. as s(x, y ), we should not use the feynman propagator that has both retarded
and advanced components. instead we should use the retarded propagator for the
(+)-domain and the advanced propagator for the (-)-domain:

here, k is the momentum in the 4 dimensional euclidean space, ) and k and k
are the on-shell momenta, k 2 = k 2 = m 2, which correspond to the positive and
negative energy states, respectively. ) the theta functions in (6) and (7) show the
directedness of the solution. in this solution, both the positive and negative states
propagate in the forward direction in the (+)-domain, while they both propagate in
the backward direction in the (-)-domain. we call (6) and (7) symmetric solutions.
(they are symmetric in the sense that the positive and negative energy parts are
equally mixed. compare them with the chiral solution presented below. ) the
above solutions satisfy the following boundary conditions:

g5m
 (advanced)  +i54(x  y) as m (x 0  y 0)  0 .

in this procedure, we naturally notice the following attractive choice of g0(x, y )

and s(x, y ): )

the conguration in which the positive energy states propagate only in the for-
ward direction of x 0 constitutes the (+)-domain, while the conguration in which
the negative energy states propagate only in the backward direction constitutes the
()-domain. as seen from their simple structure, the chiral solutions have some
advantages (at least in concrete calculations). the validity of their use, however, is a

subtle matter, because they are legitimate solutions of neither (4) nor its chiral ver-
sion. only in the extreme chiral limit (m/|k|  1) do they correspond to the chiral
operators d = i(6  + iep /a). we believe that their use is valid in the examination
of global quantities or soft-momentum (infrared) properties. (this will be conrmed
below.) the chiral solutions satisfy the boundary condition

i(g5m

+ (x, y )  g5m

 (x, y ))  54(x  y) as m|x 0  y 0|  +0 . (13)

as the nal step of this regularization prescription, we take the following double

limits[regularization prescription 3]:

|k|

(or

(ii) m t  1 ,

(14)

these relations express the most characteristic point of this 1+4 dimensional reg-
ularization scheme. the condition (ii) comes from the usage of the regularization
parameter m in (2), whereas (i) comes from the necessity of controlling the chirality
without destroying the system dynamics. ) note that the roles of the regularization
mass parameter m for the t-axis and for the x-axis are dierent. the parameter m
restricts the conguration to the ultra-violet region (t  m 1) in the extra space
of t and to the infra-red (surface) region in the real 4 dimensional space (|k|  |m|).
) (this situation regarding conguration restriction, by (i) and (ii), is discussed
further in 3 and 5.) in the concrete calculation, the condition (i) is taken into
account not by performing k-integral with the cut-o m but by using the ana-
lytic continuation in order to avoid breaking the gauge invariance[regularization
prescription 3]. )

the validity of the above regularization was conrmed in refs. 9) and 10). there
we found properties analogous to those of the lattice domain wall: the domain wall
conguration, the overlap dirac operator, the condition on the regularization pa-
rameter m , etc.. we also conrmed that the chiral anomalies (for 2d qed, 4d
qed and 2d chiral gauge theory) are correctly reproduced. one of the advantages
of the present approach is the equal treatment of the chiral and weyl anomalies. to
understand the situation, let us apply the above regularization to the weyl anomaly
calculation. we rst consider a simple model, 2d qed, for later purposes. it is
given, using the chiral solution (13), as 10)

,

) in the extreme chiral limit m/|k|  1, (k) converge to the chiral projection operators:
(k)  p . the control of the chirality is regarded as complete in this limit. the restriction,
however, is too strong to maintain the dynamics. hence, we consider the loosened restriction (i).
this procedure should be regarded as a part of the present regularization.

) this point is what we mention, at item 6) [infrared-ultraviolet relation] of the nal paragraph

of 5, as an analogous phenomenon to the brane-world approach.

) the explicit use of the momentum cut-o m (|k|  m ) clearly breaks gauge invariance. we
can show that an equivalent regularization is realized by analytic regularization, where the cut-o
parameter is not necessary. (see ref. 10).)

have conrmed that similar situation exists in 4d euclidean qed. the symmetric
solution gives the correct weyl anomaly:  ln j = (x) (e)f f , (e) = e2

where (e) is the -function in the renormalization group. ) the chiral solution
gives one fourth of it.

combined with the results for the chiral anomalies in refs. 9) and 10), we conclude
that the chiral solution gives (1/2)d/2 (where d is the spatial dimension) of the
correct value of the anomaly coecients both for the chiral anomaly and for the
weyl anomaly. the use of the chiral solution reduces the degree of freedom by
half for each two dimensions. this phenomenon seems to contrast with the lattices
doubling species phenomenon.

) the general anomaly calculation based on the ordinary (i.e. that in which the domain wall

is not used) heat-kernel is reviewed in ref. 10).

renormalization using domain wall regularization

the use of the chiral solution, instead of the symmetric solution, should be
limited to simple cases, such as the anomaly calculation. for the general case, in
which local dynamics appears and we cannot ignore o(1/m ) in (12), we should use
the symmetric solution.

3. renormalization procedure

in this and the next sections, we develop a method for using the domain wall
regularization in general eld theory. we now introduce the counterterm action
 [a] into the eective action  [a]   ln z[a] as
bare[a]   [a] +  [a]

(17)

,

in such a way that bare becomes nite. determining how to systematically dene
 and obtain the renormalization properties is the task of this section. let us
consider the simple model of 2d qed (schwinger model) for this explanation. we
consider the case in which  consists of local counterterms. ) from the power-
counting analysis, ) we have

 [a] = z d2x(cid:16)cdive2a

where cdiv, c
now, we apply the following renormalization condition to bare[a]:

(19)

the rst equation denes the renormalized coupling, and the second one guarantees
stability. )

in order to regularize the t-integral in  [a], we introduce here two more regular-
ization parameters,  and t (0 <  < t < t ,   +0 , t  +) [regularization
prescription 4]:

) in ref. 16), the divergence structure in 2d qed is closely examined. for the bosonic part of
the eective action, we need not consider the non-perturbative divergences. furthermore, by using
the special regularization (jackiw-rajaramann parameter a = 1), we can calculate using the fermion
measure, where the wess-zumino term does not appear.

) the mass dimensions of the gauge (photon) eld a and the gauge coupling (electric charge)

e are 0 and 1, respectively.

) it is known that 2d (massless) qed is exactly solvable in the non-perturbative treatment.
(see ref. 17) for a good textbook.) here, we treat it perturbatively in order to compare with 4d
qed in 4 and 5. the rst condition of (19) implies that 2d qed is a massive vector theory with
mass e

we now check above result by calculating the weyl and chiral anomalies directly
from the eective action. (in (15) and (16) of this paper, and in ref. 10), anoma-
lies are obtained from jacobians.) the weyl anomaly is obtained from the scale

which agrees with the known result. the chiral anomaly is obtained by the variation

(25)

thus, both weyl and chiral anomalies are correctly reproduced. ) note that the
chiral anomaly derived from the jacobian in ref. 9) comes from the o(a)-part of

) we notice a contrasting point in the two anomalies. the weyl anomaly does not depend on
the renormalization condition (19), whereas the chiral one does depend on it. the former gives a
response to the scale change, and hence picks up the divergent part proportional to ln t /, while
the latter gives a response to the (chiral) phase change, and hence the charge normalization, which
is dened by the renormalization condition (19), is crucial for it.

 , whereas that derived here from the eective action comes from the o(a2)-
part. (as for the weyl anomaly, the results obtained from both approaches come
from o(a2)-part.)

we conclude this section by listing all regularization parameters introduced and
comparing them with the situation in lattice. we have introduced three parame-
ters m, t and . they should satisfy the following relations with two conguration
variables, the 4-momentum k and the inverse-temperature t :

(26)

in the above, we clearly see an important feature of the parameter m . among the
three relations above, the latter two are rather familiar. (the uv cut-o scale is ,
while the ir cut-o scale is t .) the interesting one is the rst. before the appearance
of domain wall regularization, we do not know of such a regularization parameter
that depends on the conguration ( specied by k and t in the present case) in
this way. in the conclusion of this paper, we point out another important character
of the present regularization, which is obtained from the result above and that of
the next section. in the lattice domain wall case, four parameters are introduced:
m0, a, ls, l. 18) the correspondence with the present case is as follows:

present paper

ref. 18)

m  m0 (1+4 dim fermion mass),
  a (lattice spacing),
t
  ls (the total site number along the extra axis),
t  l (physical extent of one direction of the 4 dimensional box).
(27)

the one extra parameter in the lattice comes from the fact that the extra space
is treated independently of the 4 dimensional space. it is adopted in the ordinary
domain wall formulation, whereas the present one treats the extra space as the space
of the inverse temperature, which appears in expressing the determinant. in ref. 18),
the 4 dimensional fermion mass mf is also introduced.
in such a case, we also
introduce the mass parameter. (see ref. 10))

4. general treatment of renormalization

to this point, we have discussed only the fermion determinant for the external
gauge eld. in order for this approach to be regarded as an alternative new regular-
ization for general eld theories, the quantum treatment of the gauge elds should
also be described. we devote this section to this task.

the present approach quite naturally ts in the background eld method. 13), 14)
we explain it by again taking 4d euclidean qed as an example. the quantum
eects of both the gauge (photon) eld and the fermion are taken into account. we

where the feynman gauge is taken. according to the general theory of the back-
ground eld method, complete physical information is contained in the following
background eective action:

l2[, , a; , , a] = i {( + iea) + im} 

,
l3[, , a] = e  /a .
(29)

here, the elds (i) = (, , a) are the background elds, and (i) = (, , a) are
the quantum elds. we note that the term l3 = e  /a is the third order in the
quantum elds and contributes to orders of 2-loops and higher. terms in l2 are all
second order and contribute to only the 1-loop order. among them, the two terms
e  /a and e  /a are o-diagonal with respect to the quantum elds.
in order to diagonalize the 1-loop part, we redene the quantum elds as  =
 + ,  =  +  , a
 = a + a. here we choose ,   and a to be linear
with respect to the quantum elds in order to maintain the loop-order structure. we
require the 1-loop part, l2[, , a], to be equal to
i {( + iea) + im}

then  and   should satisfy

(i6   e /a  m) = e /a .

equation (31) can be perturbatively solved by requiring the natural condition
that  and   vanish when the quantum elds vanish, (a, , ) = 0. this gives

(x) = z d4y sa(x  y)e /a(y)(y) = z d4y s(x  y)e /a(y)(y) + o(e2) ,
 (x) = z d4y e (y) /a(y) sa(x  y) = z d4y e (y) /a(y) s(x  y) + o(e2) ,

where sa, sa, s and s are dened by

(i6   e /a  m)sa(x  y) = 4(x  y) , (i6   m)s(x  y) = 4(x  y) ,
sa(x  y)(i6   e /a  m)y = 4(x  y) , s(x  y)(i6   m)y = 4(x  y) .

here sa(x  y) and sa(x  y) are background dependent propagators. all these
propagators are (4d) euclidean ones, and there is no ambiguity in the choice of
boundary conditions.

this corresponds to the 1-loop part for the fermion self-energy. (see fig. 2.) indeed,
the quantum eect of the gauge eld is taken into account. (demonstrating this was
the original motivation of the present work.) because the jacobian is decoupled from
the main integral part, the regularization for the divergences in (39) can be done
independently of the regularization parameter m introduced in sec.2. the quantity
to be regularized in sec.2 was det(6  + ie /a), while the jacobian above is roughly
det(1 + e2 1
6 )/ det 2. both quantities are divergent, but
the presence of 2 inside the determinant in the latter quantity causes no chiral
problem. [there is no ambiguity in determining the divergent quantity det(2 +)
because it can be expressed as the heat equation (not the dirac equation ) in 1+4
dimension. (see 2 of ref. 10).) ] the (momentum) integral, corresponding to trace
in (39), is evaluated in the usual way, as described in standard eld theory textbooks.

5. discussion and conclusion

combining the results of 3 and 4, we present the nal form of the renor-
malization prescription (taking 4d qed as an example) with the background eld
gauge: 14)

here, the fermion determinant part only is regularized by the domain wall reg-
ularization of 2, while other parts are regularized by the cutos for the t-axis:
) in the present continuum approach, this multiplicative renormalization results from the fact
that the jacobian j decouples from the m -involved part (fermion determinant part) in (38). in the
lattice, the 4d fermion mass is essentially introduced as the coupling m1 between the walls at the two
ends of the extra axis. in this case, determining whether or not the renormalized mass is proportional
to m1 is highly non-trivial, because m could appear additively, simply for the dimensional reasons.
a numerical simulation supports the validity of the multiplicative renormalization. this fact is very
important for there to be no need for ne-tuning (good control of the small mass fermion) and for
the validity of the chiral perturbation. 19)

 < t < t (or 1
 ). the background eld gauge is chosen here and  is the
gauge parameter. l is obtained in such a way that bare becomes nite, satisfying
some proper renormalization condition on the following quantities:

t < |k| < 1

a(x)a (y) (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)= =a=0

,

.

(45)

in paticular, the fermion mass and the gauge coupling are normalized by the second
and the third conditions, respectively. the renormalization parameters are obtained
by

l[, , a; e, m] + l[, , a] = l[pz2,pz2 ,pz3a; e + e, m + m]

comparing with the case in 4, we have the relation

because the background gauge invariance is preserved. some comments, in relation
to the higher-loop structure, are in order. 14)

1. generally, the terms in the taylor expansion of l play the role of subtracting
sub-divergences in multi-loop diagrams. the proof of this point is largely based
on the structure of the taylor expansion.

2. from the viewpoint of the taylor expansion, we compare the treatment of the
gauge part in this section and 4. in 4, the gauge term  1
2 (a)2 is properly
taylor expanded in (29). therefore, in this case, the subdivergence problem is
manifestly solved. contrastingly, the background eld gauge adopted in this
section, lgauge in (44), is not taylor expanded. the proof of the subdivergence
cancellation is carried out by using the properties described in item 3, below.
the superiority of (44) is that the eective action bare is guaranteed to be
gauge invariant.

3. in relation to the subdivergence problem mentioned above, at orders of 2-loops
and higher, the gauge parameter and quantum elds suer from the renormal-
ization eect (i.e., the renormalization of internal quantities).
through this analysis, the character of the domain wall regularization is re-
vealed. the rst point of note is the condition on the regularization parameters
(26), as stated in 3. the second point is that the treatment of the fermion loop
(determinant) is dierent from that of the other types of loops, which are irrelevant
to the chiral problem. for the fermion loop, we do the calculation in the following
order: 1) the momentum (k) integral in the region |k|  m is evaluated for xed
t; 2) the procedure m t  1 is carried out; 3) the extra coordinate (t) integral is
evaluated. therefore, for each t-segment, the momentum region is suppressed as
|k|  mt( 1
t ), where the subscript t indicates a possible slight t dependence. ) in
) the consistency with the 1+4dim dirac equation (4) requires |ttm |  m . this implies that
m = const  t, with 0 <   1

fig. 3. the restricted regions of the momentum-integral in the phase space (|k|, t). all relations
between parameters and the momentum are listed in (26). three regions are shown: (a) [below
the t1 line] the ordinary integral region; (b) [below the mt line] the domain wall regularization;
(c) [far below the mt line] the extreme chiral region.

regularization considers the region below the mt line. for other types of loops, the
corresponding region is suppressed as |k|  1
t . (in fig.3, this is the region below
the t1 line.) two upper cut-os have the relation mt  1
t from the requirement
(26). it is expected that the nal physical results are not aected by the dierent
treatments, depending on the types of loops, of the momentum integrals as far as
the low energy fermion and gauge bosons are concerned. (this situation is realised
in the lattice numerical simulation.)

in the literature to this time, the domain wall has been investigated mainly with
regard to the determinant calculation for the external gauge eld. in the present
paper, we have formulated it in the general eld theory framework, using the back-
ground eld method, where both fermions and (gauge) bosons are treated as quantum
elds. we can calculate any term, in principle, of the eective action. we have ex-
plicitly carried out the renormalization of the fermion wave function and the fermion
mass. we nd that they agree with previous results.

finally, we comment on the relation with the recently popular higher-dimensional
approaches, such as the brane-world approach, randall-sundrum model, etc. they
start from a higher-dimensional gravitational theory and consider a soliton congu-
ration localized in the extra space. in this setting, the dimensional reduction from 5
dimensions to 4 dimensions takes place. in accordance with this, the mass hierarchy
characterized by some exponential factor appears. this makes the model building
based on this mechanism attractive. contrastingly, the present approach starts from
the 4 dimensions and for the purpose of the chiral regularization, we make use of

16

s. ichinose

its 5 dimensional dirac equation. we suspect that both approaches do essentially
the same thing, based on the following similar ingredients involved: 1) the domain
wall conguration; 2) the exponentially damping or growing factors; 3) the chiral
properties; 4) the scaling role played by the extra-space parameter or coordinate;
5) the fact that the regularization parameter m in the present treatment appears
to correspond to the parameter of (thickness)1 in the rs-model; 6) the fact that
infrared-ultraviolet relation appears. the purpose of the higher-dimensional models
is to nd a theory beyond the standard model. this is dierent from the present
purpose, namely, regularization of the fermion system. we can, however, nd a
common root in the paper of callan and harvey 20).
