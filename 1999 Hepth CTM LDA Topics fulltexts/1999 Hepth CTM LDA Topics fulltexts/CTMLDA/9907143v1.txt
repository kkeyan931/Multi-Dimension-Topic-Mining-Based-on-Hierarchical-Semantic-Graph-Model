abstract

the correspondence of the non-critical string theory and the yang-
mills theory is examined according to the recent polyakovs proposal,
and two possible solutions of the bulk equations are addressed near the
xed points of the pure yang-mills theory: (i) one solution asymp-
totically approaches to the ads space at the ultraviolet limit where
the conformally invariant eld theory is realized. (ii) the second one
approaches to the at space in both the infrared and the ultraviolet
limits. the area law of the wilson-loop and the asymptotic freedom
with logarithmic behaviour are seen in the respective limit.

1 introduction

inspired by the conjecture [1, 2, 3] that the conformal symmetric super
yang-mills theory is dual to the type iib supergravity in ads5  s5, several
quantities of the yang-mills theory have been calculated in terms of the
string theory with d3-branes. there are two directions to extend this duality
to the non-supersymmetric gauge theory. one way is to compactify one
dimension to obtain a nite temperature gauge theory [4], and we get a
non-supersymmetric theory. the running coupling constant is obtained by
regarding the radius of the compactication as the cut-o. although this
formulation yields a successful result for the area law of the wilson-loop, the
diculty appears in taking the continuum limit where the temperature is
taken as innite. since the coupling constant in this formalism is proportional
to the temperature, then the tension-parameter of the qcd string exceeds
the planck mass.

an alternative approach has been proposed by [5] in terms of the non-
critical string theory which is constructed from the supersymetric liouville
theory. in this theory, the space-time fermions are removed by taking the
gso projection as in the type 0 string theory [6, 7]. as a result, two kinds
of r-r elds and also the tachyon eld appear in the bulk space other than
the usual bosons of the type ii theory. while in the world volume of the
d-brane, the tachyon can be removed by imposing the gso projection on
the open string sector. then only the yang-mills eld and some scalar elds
exist in the d-brane world volume, and the mass scale of the gauge theory is
given by the liouville eld.

this formulation however suers from a possible instability due to the
bulk tachyon when the dimension is higher than two. this could be avoided
by considering an appropriate potential [8, 9] which leads to the condensation
of the tachyon or a curved space-time [10]. an interesting idea of the res-
olution for this problem has recently be given by considering the couplings
of the r-r elds and the tachyon [11, 12]. non-perturbative approaches
would however be necessary to obtain a satisfactory resolution of this prob-
lem since we must know the correct functional form of the action depending
on the tachyon to solve the problem of its vacuum.

while the idea of [5] was extended to type iib [13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18]
and type 0b [11, 12, 19, 20, 21] models by regarding the fth coordinate of
ads5 as the energy-scale of the gauge theory. in type iib model, asymptotic

freedom of the gauge coupling has been shown by adding the axion eld to
the eective supergravity action [14], but it does not show the logarithmic
decreasing of the gauge-coupling. on the other hand, the asymptotic freedom
with the logarithmic behavior was seen in the case of the type 0 model, but it
seems to be dicult to connect ultraviolet solution and the favorite infrared
solution [20].

as indicated in [5], the non-critical string theory also has a solution cor-
responding to the conformal invariant gauge theory. around this xed point,
some approaches to solving the renormalization group equations have been
given in the scheme of the non-critical string theory [22, 23, 24, 25], but more
considerations would be needed since the asymptotic freedom and other im-
portant properties of the gauge theory are still obscure.

the purpose of this paper is to study furthermore the running coupling
constant and the wilson loop of the gauge theory in terms of the non-critical
string theory, in which it is possible to study the pure yang-mills theory.
here we point out that there are two kinds of ows of the renormalization
group equations in the pure yang-mills theory. they are specied by two
types of asymptotic forms of the bulk solutions, i.e.
the ads space and
the at space. the latter type solution shows the asymptotic freedom with
logarithmic decreasing for the coupling constant in the ultraviolet region
and the area law of the wilson-loop in the infrared limit. these behaviours
are shown by imposing some conditions on the tachyon potential and the
couplings of the tachyon to the r-r elds. but both kinds of solutions
are characterized by the dierent expectation value of the tachyon since the
conditions imposed on the potential on this point are not compatible.

in section two we give the gravitational equations to be solved and the
conformal invariant interacting solution. the running behaviours from this
xed point are discussed in the section three, and we nd that the above
xed point is the ultraviolet one smoothly connected to the solution given
in type ii theory. in section four, we show another solution with the asymp-
totic freedom near the ultraviolet xed point. the gauge coupling decreases
logarithmically with the energy scale, and this solution would be connected
to the one given in the infrared limit. from this solution, we can see the
area law of the wilson-loop. in the nal section, the concluding remarks are
given.

2 the gravitational equations and conformal

xed point

the eective action of the non-critical string theory, whose boundary rep-
2 other
resents the gauge theory, should include r-r p + 1 potential ap+1
than the usual ns-ns elds. and we expect that n dp+1-branes are stacked
on the boundary to make the u(n) gauge theory there.

then we start from the following action,

sd =

p+2),

(1)

where c = (10d)/2, and fp+2 = dap+1 is the eld strength of ap+1. the
total dimension d includes the liouville direction, which is denoted by r. the
tachyon potential is represented by v (t ), and f (t ) denotes the couplings
between the tachyon and the r-r eld investigated in [11]. we consider
their simple forms in the next section. it should be noticed that there is a
problem of the stability of the tachyon in extending the non-critical string
theory to the higher dimension (d > 2). in order to evade this problem, we
assume the condensation of the tachyon and/or the resultant curved space
which includes the asymptotically ads space. in the case of ads space, the
tachyon can be stabilized even if it has a small negative mass-squared [10].
these points would be cleared by using the exact forms of v (t ) and f (t ),
but we do not know them. so the problem of the stability of the tachyon is
open here.

the equations of motion are written as

the advantage of the non-critical string scheme is to be able to avoid the
extra dimensions of the bulk space. these freedom are corresponding to the
adjoint scalars in the gauge theory, and they are not necessary to see the
characteristic features of the yang-mills theory. so the dimension d is set as
d = p + 2 to consider the case of the pure yang-mills theory hereafter. but
the extra dimensions seem to be essential to obtain an asymptotic free solu-
tion given in the type 0 model. we comment on this point in the proceeding
sections.

we solve the above equations according to the following ansatz;

ds2 = e2a(r)dxdx + e2b(r)dr2

  (r),

where x,  = 0  p, denote the space-time coordinates, and r represents
the liouville direction. here r plays the role of the energy scale for the
p + 1-dimensional gauge theory [5]. the equation (5) is solved as

rec(r) =

where d = p + 1 and n denotes the number of the p-brane. then the

before considering the problem of the renormalization group ow of the
gauge theory, we give the anti-de sitter solution as a conformal invariant
xed point since it is the starting point of our study.
it can be found by
solving the above equations by assuming that  and t are constant, i.e.
independent on r, and taking the following ansatz,

ea = (

eb = (

(14)

where r0 denotes a scale parameter which measures the scalar curvature (see
(18)). after a small calculation, we get

(18)

which is derived from eqs. (14) and (15).

from eqs. (15)  (17), we can determine t0, 0 and  if the explicit
forms of vc(t ) and f (t ) are given. as an example, we solve them by using
the following simple forms

vc(t ) =

where we take as  = 1, and the above forms are obtained from the expansion
of the eective action near t = 0 [11]. then the solutions are given as

0 = 1.17, t0 = 0.814,

 = 0.753.

(20)

we can see the deviation of the value of  from one, which is obtained in the
type iib model.

next, we briey comment on the formulation based on the thermalization,
where the hawking temperature th is introduced as a cut-o parameter of
the gauge theory according to [4]. the equations are solved by the following
ansatz with the thermal deformation h(r),

ds2 = e2a0(r)dx0dx0 + e2a(r)ijdxidxj + e2b(r)dr2

(21)

where i, j = 1  3 and

ea0 = h(r)(

r
r0

)0 ,

ea = (

r
r0

) ,

eb = h1(r)(

r

after a calculation, we nd the solution eqs.(15), (16), (17) and

h(r) = 1  (

r1
r

)d ,

(22)

(23)

where r1 denotes a new scale parameter. and th can be derived from the
completeness of the metric as follows,

th =

d

4r+1

0

r
1

.

(24)

in this construction, we can see the well-known thermodynamical properties
of the yang-mills gas with the temperature th , but it is dicult to connect
this solution to the asymptotic free running coupling constant, p, of p-
dimensional gauge theory. it is given as,

p = 0th .

(25)

since 0 is a cnstant and th   in the ultra-violet limit, then p grows
with th . so it seems necessary to consider other formulation of the conformal
breaking. as discussed below, one direction is to solve the equations by
considering the r dependence of the elds  and t , which are regarded as
the running coupling constants.

6

3 asymptotic cft solution

first, we give the solution whose ultraviolet limit is given by the ads solution
given in the previous section with constant  and t . here the r-dependence
of  and t are turned on, and the equations are solved by adopting the
ansatz (7) for the metric and the following form of the solution,

a(r) =  ln(r/r0) + a(r),

b(r) =  ln(r/r0) + b(r),

(r) = 0 + (r),

t (r) = t0 + t(r),

(26)

(27)

where , 0 and t0 are determined by the equations (15), (16) and (17). the
deviations, {a(r), b(r), (r), t(r)}, from the ads limit are obtained by solving
eqs. (10)  (13). since it is dicult to nd an exact solution, we solve the
equations by expanding the deviations in power series of (r0/r) as

i(r) = xn

i

n(

r0
r

)n ,

(28)

where the deviations dened in (27) are denoted by a vector i(r)  (a(r),

r )n. the coecients i

b(r), (r), t(r)). for example, the rst component represents a(r) = pn

an( r0
n ( an etc. ) and the index  are determined by
solving the equations. here we notice two points: (i) the reason why  = 1 is
not considered is that the index  corresponds to the lowest order coecient
of the -function of the gauge coupling as seen in eq. (35). in general this
coecient is determined by the dynamical property of the system. (ii) the
expansion form (28) can be used for both the ultraviolet and infrared regions
for the positive and negative value of  respectively.

the solution of the lowest order equations is equivalent to eqs. (16) and
(17). from the rst order equations of o(r), the following condition is
obtained if there is a non-trivial solution,

[(  d)]2 + (  d)(

where

f2 =

2

v (t0)r2

0[v (t0)/v (t0)  f (t0)/f (t0) + 2f (t0)/f (t0)].

(31)

here the eq. (29) comes from the eqs. (12) and (13) as a condition that 1
and t1 are not zero. if we take 1 = t1 = 0, then a1 = b1 = 0 are obtained
from eqs. (10) and (11). and this is the trivial solution. since t0 and 
are determined from eqs. (16) and (17) if v (t ) and f (t ) are given, then
the value of  is given by solving eq.
(29) for non-trivial solutions. we
notice here that eq.
(29) generally has four solutions for , but there is
no principle to choose one of them at present. here, we adopt the solution
which is smoothly continued to the one of iib model given at d = 10 and
d = 4. in this case, the right hand side (r.h.s.) of eq. (3) is zero, then the
corresponding solution is obtained from eq. (12) by equating its r.h.s. to be
zero. from the condition that 1 6= 0, we obtain

 = d .

(32)

in type iib model [13],  = 1 and  = 4 has been obtained. in the non-
ctitical case, we take the above form of eq. (32) as the solution for , but
the value of  is dierent from the one of the type iib case. the value of
 is given by the solution of the zeroth order equations, which depends on
the form of vc(t ) and f (t ). their simple form are given in the previous
section, but we must here impose a condition to them such that we can nd
the solution (32). substituting this solution into (29), the next condition is
obtained

.

(33)

it is easily seen that the simple form of vc(t ) and f (t ) given in the
previous section (eq.
(19)) give two real solutions  = 3.43 and 0.416
with t0 = 0.814, but d = 3.01 so these solutions do not satisfy the above
condition. in order to get the solution  = d, we must nd other form of
(19) such that they satisfy eq. (33). it is straightforward to determine the
coecients of the expansions by solving the equations if the explicit forms of
vc(t ) and f (t ) are given. but to nd such functions is out of our present
work, so it would be addressed in a separate paper.

we comment on the meaning of  from the viewpoint of the yang-mills
theory. the solutions of  = d > 0 can be regarded as the non-critical

8

string version of the one given in the type iib model [13]. as in [13], we
can see the renormalization group equation of the gauge coupling constant,
 = ne = ng2

y m . it is expanded as

 = 0(cid:26)1 + 1(

ro
r

) +   (cid:27) ,

(34)

then we obtain from the denition of the -function, ()  rd/dr, the
following result:

 (0) = .

(35)

from this, we can see that the ads limit is the ultraviolet (infrared) xed
point for  > 0 (  < 0 ). although the result is dependent on the form of
vc(t ) and f (t ), it is expected that the ads is the ultraviolet xed point if
it is smoothly connected to the type iib model.

nextly we consider the quark-antiquark potential (uq q) with a distance l
between them. the potential can be obtained by estimating the wilson-loop
according to [26]. the minimized nambu-goto action, sm, and the distance
l can be obtained by using the approximate solution with the rst order
corrections as

[b(1/4, 1/2) + (a1 + b1)e /2b(1/4 + /4, 1/2)], (36)

[b(3/4, 1/2) + (b1  3a1)e /2b(3/4 + /4, 1/2)].

(37)

here b(a, b) denotes the beta-function and e is an integral constant. and
 is the length in the time-direction of the wilson loop. the above formula
are obtained from the approximate solution of the order o((r0/r)), so we
write the resultant potential derived from them as the following approximate
form,

uq q =

for c3 > 0, coulomb attraction can be seen near the xed point as in type
iib model. the next order correction in uq q would deviate from the result
of [13] since / 6= 4 is expected.

the solutions considered in this section would represent the running be-
haviour of the parameters in a dierent phase from that we are searching
for. in the next section we discuss the solution which shows the asymptotic
freedom at ultraviolet region.

4 asyptotic free solution

here we investigate the solutions which leads to the asymptotic freedom of
the gauge coupling constant, i.e. it decreases logarithmically with the energy
scale. the equations in the ultraviolet region (large r) are solved in terms of
the following expansions for i according to [20, 12],

a(r) = a0 ln y + a1

b(r) = b0 ln y + b1

(41)

(42)

(43)

(44)

where y = ln(r/r0), and we assume 0 < 0, which is required from the
asymptotic freedom.

while the equations (10)  (13) are rewritten by using i as follows:

where the dot denotes the derivative with respect to y.

for this formulation, we rstly nd

 = 0 .

(48)

(49)

this is seen as follows. from eqs. (45) and (46), we must require the relation,
b0 =  0 > 0, to obtain the result  6= 0. if we use this relation in eqs. (47)
and (48), then we obtain vc(t0) = v 
c (t0) = 0. then 0 = 0 is derived from
the same equations, but this result is not compatible with  6= 0 from eqs.
(45) and (46). then we are led to the result (49). this result implies that
the bulk space is asymptotically not the ads but the at space as seen from
(18). this seems to be reasonable since the ux of the r-r eld, which was
the essencial factor to derive the ads space, is suppressed in the equations to
be solved by the factor e2 near the ultraviolet limit due to the asymptotic
freedom. and the ux term contributes to the higher orders of equations to
reform the at space to a curved one.

we notice however that there are two ways to get an asymptotic free
solution which is compatible with the asymptotic ads bulk-space. one way
is to consider the extra dimension with the following metric,

ds2 = e2a(r)dxdx + e2b(r)dr2 + ek(r)gabdxadxb ,

(50)

where gab denotes (d-d-1)-dimensional sphere. in this case, the solution for
the rr-eld (9) is altered and the factor e2(b+) of the r-r ux term in the
equations is changed to e2(b+[dd1]k). then the r-r term in the lowest
order of equations can be retained even in the asymptotic-free case since the
energy dependence of  can be cancelled by b and k. this was explicitly
seen in the einstein frame of the type-0 model [20]. as a result, one can
get an asymptotic ads solution with the asymptotic freedom. however this
is restricted to the case of d = 10 for p = 3 due to the consistency of the
equations, which demands the condition, d  2p  4 = 0. then this type
of solutions are excluded for the pure yang-mills theory, in which d = 5 for
p = 3, and also for d < 10 with the extra spaces xa.

the second way is to consider a special form of f (t ), which could cancel
the logatithmic energy dependence of e2(b+). however this idea seems to be
unreasonable since the tachyon should largely deviate from t0 at large y due

11

to the factor ln y which is necessary to cancel the same factor in b + . as a
result, one expects that the bulk system would become unstable there.

then it is the most probable case to consider the suppression of the rr
term in the ultraviolet limit. this implies that the asymptotic bulk space in
the non-critical string theory is not the ads but the at space which is dual
to the asymptotic-free yang-mills theory. then we rstly solve the equations
by neglecting the r-r term in the lowest order. while the order of this r-r
term is determined by solving the equations of lower order series where this
term is still neglected.

on the other hand, there is no reason to suppress vc(t ) in the lowest
order of equations, and the situation depends on the value of b0. there are
two possibilities, i.e. (i) b0 = 1 and (ii) b0 < 1. in the rst case, vc(t )
should be retained. and vc(t ) is also neglected in the second case, but it
is seen in this case that we can not determine the value of b0 and 0 by the
lower order of equations at least up to o(y3). then we cosider the former
case, b0 = 1, hereafter.

in this case, the potential term vc(t ) is included in the lowest order
equations of (12) and (13). there are two possible solutions 0 = 1/2 and
0 = 1. here we adopt the latter solution since it leads to the correct index
of the logarithmic decreasing of the gauge coupling, i.e. g2
y m  1/y. this
means that the r-r term appears in the equations of order o(1/y4) for the
rst time. then the followings are obtained by solving the equations up to
the order of o(1/y4):

a(r) =

other coecients are given by solving the equations of higher orders, but
we do not do it here. for the solution up to this order, we can make the
following remarks: (i) the asymptotic bulk geometry is the at space. this

12

ym = e, decreases like g2

is seen by changing the liouville coordinate r to   ln ln r, and also from
eq. (18) for  = 0. (ii) the yang-mills coupling constant, which is dened
by g2
ym  (ln r)1 at large r. and this index 1
is the expected value from the perturbative calculation in the yang-mills
theory. but there is no term like y1 ln y in (r), so the two-loop order
correction for g2
ym is lacking in this result. (iii) the value of the potential
at t0 is restricted through the conditions in (53). we can see that the latter
condition v 
c (t0) = 0 is not compatible with the condition required in the
section 3 to obtain the ads xed point. then the asymptotic free solution
would represent the dierent phase of the gauge theory from the one given
in the previous section.

related to the second remark, we notice that the expected value of index
is not obtained in the type 0b model. but this problem is resolved in 0b
model by considering the eective coupling-constant obtained by evaluating
the wilson-loop [20] near the ultraviolet region.

in our model, the leading part of the q q potential can be estimated by

using the lowest order of solution:

a(r) = 0,

b(r) =  ln(r/r0) + b0 ln ln(r/r0).

(54)

according to the usual analysis, we obtain

uq q = s0s1 + (

where

s0 =

l0 = r0z

(55)

(56)

here we introduced an infrared cuto  since the approximate formula (54)
is useful for large r (large y). since we are considering the ultraviolet region,
then (55) would be useful at small l and it should be expanded as follows,

uq q  s0[1 +

this represents the harmonic type of potential, and the coulomb potential
does not appear. the reason why we can not see the 1/l term is that
our solution is not the asymptotic ads one, which leads to a conformal
eld theory as a xed point and the coulomb potential. while, a coulomb

13

potential with a logarithmic correction was found in the type 0b model. this
is because of that the bulk solution is asymptotically ads in this case. but
this kind of behaviour can not be seen in the pure yang-mills theory because
the bulk space is asymptotically at. so we can not discuss the problem of
the index of the logarithmic behaviour of the coupling constant as in the type
0b model.

although eq. (57) is valid at small l, this potential implies the quark
connement. in fact, the eq. (55) shows the linear potential at large l. so
we examine whether the similar potential can be obtained also in the infrared
region.

we can proceed the analysis with the same formalism in the infrared
region. first, the variable y is changed to y =  ln r and the region of large
y ( small r) is considered. then, eqs. (45)  (48) used in the ultraviolet
region are also useful in the infrared region if we change the sign of the single
derivative terms like a   a. then we can use the same expansion form of
i, (41)  (44), for the infrared region.

in solving the equations, we rstly consider the r-r term as in the ul-
traviolet limit. this term is proportional to e2(b+), so we expect that it
increases in the infrared region since e becomes large. here we search for
a solution which asymptotically approaches to the at space also in the in-
frared limit, i.e.  = 0. because this solution could lead to a favourable q q
potential. in order to obtain this type of solution, we suppose that e  e0
in the infrared limit and b0 < 1. namely, the r-r term is suppressed in
the lowest order equations also in the infrared limit, and the gauge coupling
approaches a large but nite-constant value. due to these restrictions, we
are led to the solution

a0 = 0 , 0 = 0,

(58)

by solving the lowest order equations of o(1/y2).

from the next order of equations, we obtain b0 = 2. so the r-r term
and the potential of t appears in the equations of order o(1/y4) for the rst
time. up to this order, we obtain

a(r) = o(

),

b(r) = 2 ln y + o(

(r) = o(

0 = 8f (t0).

(61)

the coecients of the above terms written as o(..) can not be obtained by
the parameters given in the equations up to this order, but they are taken
to be non-zero values. the last result (61) is obtained by using eq. (53)
obtained in the urtraviolet region by assuming that the two solutions are
connected smoothly. this implies that the coupling constant at the infrared
xed point is given by the coupling of the tachyon to the r-r elds.

for this solution, we obtain the same q q potential with the one obtained
in the ultraviolet region, eq. (55). it should be used for large l in this case,
and we can see the linear potential,

l .

(62)

from this, the qcd string tention is obtained as 1/2 in the unit of  = 1.
this is the expected behavior for the yang-mills theory in the infrared region.
it is important to nd a solution which connects the solutions given in the
two limits, but it is open here.

5 conclusions

by extending the idea of the ads/cft correspondence, we have examined
the equations of the eective action of non-critical string theory as the renor-
malization group equations of the yang-mills theory. the analysis is re-
stricted to the case of d = 5, where d is the bulk dimension, to see the
properties of the pure yang-mills theory. in this model, the unknown func-
tions of the tachyon are included, so we need their explicit form if we want
the quantitative and denite results. however, we could get several quali-
tative features of the yan-mills theory from the asymptotic solutions of the
non-critical string. two kinds of ultraviolet xed points have been found;
(i) one is the asymptotic free xed point with the logarithmic decreasing
of the gauge coupling constant with respect to the enrgy scale. the index
of the lowest term of the gauge coupling is consistent with the yang-mills
theory, but the two loop correction term is lacking. applying this scheme
to the small energy scale limit, the solution near the infrared xed point is

15

also found. (ii) another is the one of a conformal eld theory limit corre-
sponding to the ads5 bulk space, which is related to the solution of type iib
model if we impose an appropriate condition on the potential (vc(t )) and
the coupling to the r-r eld (f (t )) of the tachyon eld (t ) at t = t0.

the second solution approaches to the ads near the xed point, and
coulombnic q q potential is seen from the estimation of the wilson-loop
by using the asymptotic solution. this solution can be considered as the
variation of the one given in the type iib model. on the other hand, the
asymptotic form of the rst type solution is the at space, and this leads to
the harmonic osccilator type q q potential in the ultraviolet limit. and the
linear potential is obtained in the infrared region, where the gauge coupling
approaches to a constant xed point. then it would be probable that there
is an exact solution which smoothly connect these two limit solutions. it is
an open problem to nd such solution here.

the two urtlaviolet xed points of type (i) and (ii) are realized at dierent
value of t0, which is independent on the energy scale, so these points could
not be connected by one solution of our equations presented here. new
elements or new dynamical speculations would be needed to connect them.
this would be an interesting problem of the pure yang-mills theory.
