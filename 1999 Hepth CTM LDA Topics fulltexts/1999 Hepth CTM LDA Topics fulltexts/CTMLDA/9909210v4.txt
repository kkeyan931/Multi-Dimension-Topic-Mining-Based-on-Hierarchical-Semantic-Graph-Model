abstract

we apply general formalism of quantum eld theory and addition theo-
rem for bessel functions to derive formula for the casimir-polder energy of
interaction between a polarizable particle and a dilute dielectric ball and
casimir energy of a dilute dielectric ball. the correspondence between
the casimir-polder formula and casimir energy of a dilute dielectric ball
is shown. dierent approaches to the problem of casimir energy of a di-
electric ball are reviewed and analysed by use of addition theorem for bessel
functions.

1 introduction

the study of spherical geometry in casimir eect meets a lot of technical
problems, the most dicult one is the problem of divergencies, which appear
in many expressions. the special interest to the subject arised after the
series of articles by julian schwinger where he had proposed a connection
between the casimir eect and sonoluminescence [1, 2]. the main reason for
drastically dierent results in the calculations on the topic is the problem of
divergent expressions and their regularization. in the present paper we show
how the calculations can be performed to obtain nite results for the case
of a dilute dielectric ball. for a discussion of possible divergencies and their
regularization in this case see also [3].

we study a dielectric nonmagnetic ball of radius a and permittivity ,
surrounded by a vacuum. the ball is dilute, i.e. all nal expressions are
obtained under the assumption   1  1. the permittivity  for simplicity
is a constant.
in the present paper we follow the formalism which was developed by
e.lifshitz et.al.[4] and k.milton et.al.[5]. we start from a short overview of
known facts. then we derive the casimir-polder energy between a dielectric
ball and a particle of constant polarizability , which is placed at the distance
r from the centre of the ball. the addition theorem for bessel functions
is used.
in the limiting case r  a the casimir-polder formula for two
polarizable particles [6] can be simply obtained from this expression. also we
show how casimir energy of a dilute dielectric ball can be derived analytically
with no divergencies in intermediate calculations by use of proper analytic
continuation. the value of casimir energy of a dilute dielectric ball has
been obtained in [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12] using various methods, an overview and
analysis of dierent approaches to this problem by use of addition theorem
for bessel functions are given in the conclusions section.
we put  = c = 1. heaviside-lorentz units are used.

this expression can be transformed to a simple formula in the limit 1  1.
the functions bf and bg are proportional to (1) in this limit. to proceed,

to our knowledge this formula was rst used in casimir eect calculations in
[16],where it was applied to analytic calculation of casimir energy of perfectly
conducting spherical shell and dilute dielectric ball satisfying  = 1.

in our case it can be applied as follows. the simple identity holds (we

we only need the rst order  ( 1) in e1. we put k = r/a, p = 1 and use

thus in this limit the famous casimir-polder energy of interaction between
two polarizable particles ecasp ol [6] can be obtained directly from (22).

imagine now that there is a bubble of radius a in a dielectric of permit-
tivity  and we insert dielectric into the point r,|r| < a inside the bubble so
that the change in dielectric permittivity is equal to  = (  1)3(r  x).
the energy change is given by (1) again. we omit details of calculations
because of obvious similarity with discussion above , note only that formula
for energy change e2(r, a) in the order ( 1)2 can be obtained from formula
for e1(r, a) in the order (  1)2 written in terms of bessel functions by a
simple interchange sl  el,   (  1)/(4) and adding an overall minus
sign. the result for e2 can be written as follows :

to obtain casimir energy of a dilute dielectric ball we calculate the energy
change ecas using formula (1) and symmetry in interchange   1 in the
order (  1)2, so that ecas can be written via previously obtained e1( =

(strictly speaking, we had to substitute r  a in e2(r, a) rst and only after
that perform the subtraction. we would have got two divergent terms then
and a nite term that is general for all approaches - see conclusions section
for an overview. however, there is a possibility to derive the nite term
directly - to use analytic continuation from r < a to r > a in e2 and then
perform the subtraction as in (24) - a simple way to cancel divergent terms.)
if we take into consideration only the nite term (for an extensive discussion
of this issue see [8]), the casimir energy of a dilute dielectric ball and surface
force on a unit area are given by

3 conclusions

we derive formulas for casimir-polder type energy between a polarizable
particle and a dilute dielectric ball (21,22) and casimir surface force on a
dilute dielectric ball (25) analytically using quantum eld theory approach
and addition theorem for bessel functions. our approach directly shows
correspondence of this force and casimir-polder potential. proper analytic
continuation has been used to obtain the nal result (25).

it is of interest to give here an overview of dierent approaches which have
been used to derive the result (25) and show how formula (18) can eectively
be used in other approaches.

first attempts to solve the problem of nding the casimir energy of a
dielectric ball gave a lot of dierent answers, as it is described in [10]. the
mathematical reason for these dierences was found in the work [7], where
by use of debye expansion for bessel functions and -function the correct
limits on casimir surface force in the order (  1)2 were established. later
in the article [8] the value of casimir energy of a dilute dielectric ball was
calculated numerically with high accuracy, which made it possible to establish

5

equivalence of casimir eect and retarded van der waals energy for the case
of nondispersive dielectric ball.

the retarded van der waals energy for two distant molecules or the
casimir- polder potential is ecasp ol = 2312/4r7. the mutual van
der waals energy for molecules inside the compact sphere (ball) was calcu-
lated by milton and ng [9], and its nite part after regularization in terms
of gamma functions was rst given by (25) in the work [9].

in the article [8] the casimir energy of a dilute dielectric ball was studied

via the formula which has the following form for nondispersive case:

ec =

(27)

and riccati-bessel functions are assumed to depend on argument x. this
formula possesses an interesting symmetry : sl  el. from our derivation of
formula (25) and discussion before formula (23) it follows that this symmetry
is equivalent to the symmetry   1, so our derivation claries this point.
the formula (26) can be studied using formula (18) as well. we put
k = 1, p = 1  m, where we are interested in the limit m  0. for ec we
nd

ec = lim

(28)

recently the formula (26) has been obtained from the mode summation
method [12], there divergent terms being analysed and the nite result (25)
being derived also by making use of the addition theorem for the bessel
functions.

another approach based on quantum mechanical perturbation theory was
suggested in the work [10]. the casimir energy was obtained there in the
form:

e = (  1)

(29)

here v is the volume and s the surface area, 1/ is an exponential cuto on
wavenumbers. in this approach the contact terms havent been subtracted,

6

this is why the term proportional to   1 is present in (29). the cuto
independent term is essentially the same in all approaches.
the approach based on quantum statistical mechanics was developed in

[11]. this work led to similar results.

the theory of qed in a dielectric background was studied in [3] by path

integral and -function methods. -function can be written as in [3]:

(s) =

sin s





xl=1

(2l + 1)z

d 2s 


ln(l l).

(30)

for a dilute ball it is possible to expand the logarithm in powers of   1,
here we analyse only the order (  1)2 of this expansion:
d 2s 


(  1)2

fl(a),

(s) =

sin s

(31)

xl=1

(2l + 1)z

where fl(x) is dened in (27). we assume s > 1 and calculate expression
(31) using formula (18) again, where now we put p = k = 1. the result is

(s) = (  1)2 sin(s)

s

with no poles in this expression for s < 1. after analytic continuation to
s = 1/2, for casimir energy we nd

-function method makes it possible to avoid divergent terms in calculations.
most diculties in casimir eect problems result from divergent struc-
ture of dierent expressions near boundaries, though the divergent behaviour
of these expressions is general for all casimir eect calculations. when dis-
persion is neglected, divergent behaviour is the same as in (21) or (23) when
r  a (the simplest example is the casimir-polder energy between the polar-
izable particle and perfectly conducting plate, see e.g. [17] and a discussion
there). divergencies are usually present in casimir eect calculations as the
reminders of short-distance behaviour of casimir-polder type and van der
waals type potentials between interacting particles, the example presented
in this work serves as a conrmation of this statement. it would be illumi-
nating to overcome the problem of divergencies and understand how to deal
with van der waals and casimir-polder type potentials in casimir related
problems by methods of quantum eld theory, though probably this is not
only the problem of casimir eect itself but rather quantum eld theory in
general.
