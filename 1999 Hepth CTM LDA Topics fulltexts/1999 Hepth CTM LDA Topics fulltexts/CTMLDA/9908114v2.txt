abstract

light cone gauge manifestly supersymmetric formulations of type iib 10-dimensional supergrav-
ity in ads5  s5 background and related boundary conformal eld theory representations are
developed. a precise correspondence between the bulk elds of iib supergravity and the bound-
ary operators is established. the formulations are given entirely in terms of light cone scalar
superelds, allowing us to treat all component elds on an equal footing.

introduction. a long-term motivation for our investigation comes from the following poten-
tially important application. inspired by the conjectured duality between the string theory and
n = 4, 4d sym theory [1] the green-schwarz formulation of strings propagating in ads5  s5
was suggested in [2] (for further developments see [3]-[5]). despite considerable eorts these
strings have not yet been quantized (some related interesting discussions are in [6]). alternative
approaches can be found in [7]. as is well known, quantization of gs superstrings propagating in
at space is straightforward only in the light cone gauge. it is the light cone gauge that removes
unphysical degrees of freedom explicitly and reduces the action to quadratic form in string coor-
dinates. the light cone gauge in string theory implies the corresponding light cone formulation
for target space elds. the string theories are approximated at low energies by supergravity
theories. this suggests that we should rst study a light cone gauge formulation of supergravity
theory in ads spacetime. understanding a light cone description of type iib supergravity in
ads5  s5 background might help to solve problems of strings in ads spacetime.
keeping in mind extremely important applications to string theory, in this paper we develop
the light cone gauge formulation of iib supergravity in ads5  s5 and the associated boundary
cft and apply our results to the study of ads/cft correspondence at the level of state/operator
matching. our method is conceptually very close to the one used in [8] (see also [9]) to nd the
light cone form of iib supergravity in at space and is based essentially on a light cone gauge
description of eld dynamics developed recently in [10]. a discussion of iib supergravity at the
level of gauge invariant equations of motion and actions can be found in [11] and [12] respectively.
as is well known in the case of the massless elds, investigation of ads/cft correspondence
requires the analysis of some subtleties related to the fact that transformations of massless bulk
elds are dened up to local gauge transformations. these complications are absent in the
light cone formulation because here we deal only with the physical elds, and this allows us to
demonstrate the ads/cft correspondence in a rather straightforward way.

light cone form of psu(2, 2|4) superalgebra and notation. we use the following

here and below we set the radii of both ads5 and s5 equal to unity. the boundary at spatial
innity corresponds to z = 0. the s5 coordinates yij are subject to the constraints

where ijkn = 1 is the levi-civita tensor of su(4). the coordinates yij are related to the
standard so(6) cartesian coordinates ym , m = 1, . . . , 6, which satisfy the constraint ym ym = 1
through the formula yij = m
ij are the clebsh gordan coecients of su(4) algebra
[13]. we use the coordinates yij instead of ym as this allows us to avoid using various cumbersome
gamma matrix identities. to develop light cone formulation we introduce light cone variables

x  (x4  x0)/2, x  (x1 + ix2)/2, x  x, where x0  t. in the following we treat x+ as
now let us discuss the form of the algebra of isometry transformations of ads5  s5 super-
space, that is psu(2, 2|4), which we are going to use. the even part of this algebra is the algebra
so(4, 2) which is the isometry algebra of ads5 and the algebra so(6) which is the isometry algebra
of s5. the odd part of the algebra consists of 32 supercharges which are responsible for 32 killing
spinors in ads5  s5 space. we prefer to use the form of so(4, 2) algebra provided by nomencla-
ture of conformal algebra. in this notation we have, as usual, translations p a, conformal boosts

in the light cone basis we have: j x, j x, j +, j xx, p , p x, p x, k , k x, k x. we simplify

non vanishing elements + = + = 1, xx =  xx = 1.

light cone gauge formulation of iib supergravity in ads5  s5 background. our
next step is to nd a realization of psu(2, 2|4) superalgebra on the space of iib supergravity
elds propagating in ads5  s5. to do that we use light cone superspace formalism. first, we
introduce light cone superspace which by denition is based on position ads5  s5 coordinates
x, x, x, z, yij and grassmann position coordinates i and i which transform in fundamental
4 irreps of su(4) algebra. second, on this light cone superspace we introduce scalar supereld
(x, x, x, z, yij , i, i). in the remainder of this paper we nd it convenient to fourier transform
to momentum space for all coordinates except for the radial z and s5 coordinates yij. this implies
using p, p+, p, p, i, i instead of x+, x, x, x, i, i respectively. the i and i transform
in 4 irreps of su(4). thus we consider the supereld (p, p, p, z, yij , i, i) with the following
expansion in powers of grassmann momenta i and i

p +, p, p , j +x, j +x, k +, k, k, q+i, q+

which we refer to as kinematical generators, and

which we refer to as dynamical generators. the kinematical generators have positive or zero
j + charges, while dynamical generators have negative j + charges. for x+ = 0 the kinematical
generators are quadratic in the physical eld , while the dynamical generators receive corrections
in interaction theory. in this paper we deal with free elds. at a quadratic level both kinematical
and dynamical generators have the following representation in terms of the physical light cone
supereld

g = z dp+d2pdzds5d4d4 p+(p, z, y,, )g(p, z, y, ,  ) ,

where g are the dierential operators acting on . thus we should nd representation of
psu(2, 2|4) in terms of dierential operators acting on light cone scalar supereld . to simplify
expressions let us write down the generators for x+ = 0. the kinematical generators are then
given by

remaining generators k, si, s
i , k  are obtainable from the above generators via commutation
relations of psu(2, 2|4) superalgebra. because these expressions are not illuminating we do not
present them here.
following [10] we shall call the operator a the ads mass operator. few comments are in
order. (i) the operator a is equal to zero only for massless representations which can be realized
as irreducible representations of conformal algebra [14],[10] which for the case of ads5 space is
the so(5, 2) algebra. below we shall demonstrate that operator x (15) has eigenvalues equal
to squared integers in the whole spectrum of compactication of iib supergravity on ads5.
this implies that operator a (15) is never equal to zero. from this we conclude that the scalar
elds [15] as well as all remaining elds of compactication of iib supergravity do not satisfy
conformally invariant equations of motion. (ii) generators involve the terms linear and quadratic
in grassmann variables i, i and terms up to fourth power in i and i. the coordinate i (or
i) constitutes odd part of light cone superspace appropriate to supereld description of light
cone gauge n = 4, 4d sym theory. the terms of the third and fourth powers in i and i are
expressible in terms of the operator a and its commutators with i and i.

recall that the above representation was given for x+ = 0. to study ads/cft correspon-

dence we shall need the generators for arbitrary x+  i+

p which are given by

gx+ = e+

gx+=0e+

gx+ = gx+=0  +

p [p , gx+=0] +

p [p , [p , gx+=0]] .

using these relations we derive the complete expression for conformal supergenerators

making use of the expression for p  (12) we can immediatelly write down the light cone gauge
action

sl.c. = z d4pdzds5d4d4 p+(p, z, y,, )(p + p )(p, z, y, ,  ) .

since the action is invariant with respect to the symmetries generated by psu(2, 2|4) superalgebra,
the formalism we discuss is sometimes referred to as an o shell light cone formulation [9].
in what follows we shall exploit the following above mentioned important property of the
operator x (15)  that its eigenvalues are squared integers. let us demonstrate this important
fact. first, we expand the scalar supereld (4) in s5 coordinates yij and grassmann momentum
i

(18)

(19)

the rst constraint tells us that l,a is an eigenvalue vector of square of su(4) orbital momentum
li
j, while the second constraint tells us that l,a is a monomial of degree a in i. note that
supereld 0 consists of elds of n = 8, 5d ads supergravity, while the superelds l>0 are
responsible for kaluza-klein modes. second, we evaluate eigenvalues of x for each supereld
l,a in turn. for the case of l,0, l,4 the eigenvalues of x are easily found to be

xl,0 = (l + 2)2l,0 ,

xl,4 = (l + 2)2l,4 .

in deriving the second relation one needs to use the relation like

where ijk
is totally antisymmetric in i, j, k. next, we analyse the spectrum of x in l,1 and
l,3. in contrast to (20) it turns out that these superelds themselves do not diagonalize the
operator x. now we decompose the superelds l,1 and l,3 as follows

l,1 = (1)

l,1 + (2)
l,1 ,

l,3 = (1)

l,3 + (2)
l,3 ,

and superelds i
straightforward calculation gives the following eigenvalues of operator x

l,1, ijk

l + 4
l,3 do not depend on i. the ijk

l,3 is totally antisymmetric in i, j, k.

l,1 = (l + 1)2(1)

l,1 = (l + 3)2(2)

l,1 , x(1)

l,3 = (l + 1)2(1)

l,3 , x(2)

l,3 = (l + 3)2(2)
l,3 .

finally, we consider the most challenging case of the supereld l,2.
supereld is decomposed into three superelds which are eigenvectors of operator x

it turns out that this

l,2 = (1)

l,2 + (2)

l,2 + (3)

l,2  (cid:16)ij 
(2)
l,2  (cid:16)ij +
(3)
l,2  (cid:16)ij +

where the supereld ij
straightforward calculation gives the following eigenvalues of the operator x

l,2 does not depend on i and is totally antisymmetric in i, j. relatively

x(1)

l,2 = l2(1)
l,2 ,

x(2)

l,2 = (l + 2)2(2)
l,2 ,

x(3)

l,2 = (l + 4)2(3)
l,2 .

thus we have demonstrated that the operator x in whole space of supereld  take values which

are squares of integers. this implies that the operator   x is well dened and possesses

integer eigenvalues which are chosen to be positive in what follows.

light cone form of boundary cft. the next primary goal of this work is to nd a light
cone gauge realization of psu(2, 2|4) superalgebra at the boundary of ads5s5 which is m 3,1s5,
where m 3,1 is a (3+1) minkowski space time (for a review of cft see, for instance, [16]). at this
boundary the superalgebra acts as the algebra of conformal transformations. now we have to
realize this superalgebra on the space of conformal operators. to this end we introduce boundary
light cone superspace which is based on momentum variables p, p, p, position s5 coordinate
yij and the grassmann momentum variables i, i. on this light cone superspace we dene a
supereld oloc which is collection of cft operators with canonical dimensions (currents) and
supereld oloc which is a collection of shadow operators (sources). these superelds have a
in general the representation of
similar expansion in i and i as the supereld  (4) does.
psu(2, 2|4) algebra in oloc diers from the one in oloc. it turns out however that if we introduce
the new basis

o = q 1

(22)
then the representations of psu(2, 2|4) in o and o coincide. we found the following realization
of psu(2, 2|4) superalgebra in terms of dierential operators acting on cft superelds o, o

(25). the remarkable property of realization we constructed is that the dependence on ads
mass operator a in cft is dual to ads representations. namely, on ads side the a appears
in p  (12) having 1 d- and j +- charges, while on cft side this operator appears in k +
(24) having opposite, i.e., +1 d and j +- charges. the same duality is the case of ads q
generators (14) having 1/2 d-and j + charges and cft s+ generators (26) having opposite,
i.e., +1/2 d- and j +-charges. as before, the nonlinear dependence on grassmann variables
i, i is expressible through the operator a. as was said already, the above representation is
applicable to both o and o. the price for this is that the generators are no longer local with
respect to the transverse momenta p and p included in q. however, these nonlocal terms cancel
when we transform from o and o basis into the one of oloc and oloc.

ads/cft correspondence. after we have derived the light cone formulation for both the
bulk supereld  and the boundary conformal theory operators collected in o and o we are

8

ready to demonstrate explicitly the ads/cft correspondence. we demonstrate that boundary
values of normalizable solutions of bulk equations of motion are related to conformal operators
oloc, while the ones of non-normalizable solutions are related to operators oloc (see [17],[10]).
to this end let us consider solutions to light cone equations of motion which, as usual, take the
form p  = p. taking into account the expression for p  (12) and rewriting these equations
as

(cid:16)2

z +

1
z2 (2 

1
4

)(cid:17) = q2 ,

 

x ,

we immediately get the following normalizable and non-normalizable solutions

norm = qzj(qz)io ,

nonnorm = qz y(qz)i o ,

(29)
where o, o are scalar superelds do not depending on z. the j and y are bessel and neumann
functions respectively. the normalization factor i is included for convenience. in (29) we use
the notation o, o since we are going to demonstrate that these are indeed the cft superelds
discussed above. namely, we are going to prove that ads transformations for  lead to conformal
theory transformations for o (and o)

gads = z(qz)igcf to ,

z(z)  zj(z) .

(30)

here and below we use the notation gads and gcf t to indicate the realization of psu(2, 2|4)
algebra generators on the bulk eld (7)-(10) and conformal operator (23)-(27) respectively.
now let us make a comparison of generators for bulk eld  and boundary operator o.
important technical simplication is that it is sucient to make comparison only for the part of
the algebra spanned by generators

p , p,

p ,

j +,

j x,

j x, k +, qi, q

j xx, d ,

it is straightforward to see that if these generators match then the remaining generators k  and
k, k, si, s
shall match due to commutation relations of the psu(2, 2|4) superalgebra. we
i
start with a comparison of the kinematical generators (5). as for the generators p +, p , p , j +x,
j +x, j xx, j i
i they already coincide on both sides (see (7)-(10) and (23)-(27)). in fact
this implies that the coordinates p+, p, p, yij, i and i we use on ads and cft sides match.

j, q+i, q+

cf t also match. taking this into account it is straightforward to see that the generators
cf t , dcf t (27) satisfy the relation (30). next we consider kinematical
cf t (24). here we use the following relation

ads = p we get p 

ads = z(qz)ip 

adsz(qz) = z(qz)(cid:16)k +

where k +
and the fact that o in (29) does not depend z we get immediately that k +
the relation (30).

0cf t are given in (17) and (28) respectively. using then (29), the above relation
cf t satisfy

ads and k +

the last step is to match the generators qi

i cf t. this is the most
challenging part of the analysis. let us consider qi. generalization of our discussion to the
case of q
is straightforward. as is seen from (14) and (25) requiring that these supercharges
i
satisfy the basic relation (30) gives the following nontrivial relation

i ads and qi

ads, q

which is understood in weak sense, i.e., as an operator relation dened on the space of supereld
o. this interesting relation is proved in appendix. the same relation is valid in the case of
the neumann function. taking into account matching qi, q
i and p  we conclude that j x,
j x (13) also match. above analysis is obviously generalized to the case of non-normalizable
solutions and shadow operators (29).

thus we have demonstrated that boundary operators in o, o in (29) are indeed the conformal
operators. because of multiplicative factors j and y involving powers of q the operators o
and o, however, are not boundary values of solutions of the bulk equations of motion (29). on
other hand, by relations (22) it is easily seen that it is oloc ( oloc) that is the boundary value of
norm (nonnorm), i.e. for small z one has the local interrelations
nonnorm  z+ 1

norm  z+ 1

note that for  = 0 the factor z in the second relation of (32) should be replaced by log z.

conclusions. we have developed the light cone gauge formulation of iib supergravity in
ads5  s5 background and applied this formulation to the study of ads/cft correspondence
(for review see [18]). because the formulation is given entirely in terms of the light cone scalar
supereld it allows us to treat all elds of iib supergravity on equal footing and in a mani-
festly supersymmetric way. comparison of this formalism with other approaches available in the
literature leads us to the conclusion that this is a very ecient formalism indeed. the results
presented here should have a number of interesting generalizations, some of which are:

level of cubic interaction vertices (see [19]).

(i) extension of light cone formulation of iib supergravity in ads5  s5 background to the
(ii) extension of light cone formulation of conformal eld theory to the level of opes and a

study of light-cone form of ads/cft correspondence at the level of correlation functions.

(iii) generalization of light cone gauge formalism to the study of compactications of 11-
in these cases a formulation in

dimensional supergravity on ads4  s7 and ads7  s4 [20].
terms of light-cone scalar superelds could also be developed.

in view of previous experiences with massless higher spin elds in ads4 space it is known that
to construct self-consistent interactions for such elds it is necessary to introduce an innite tower
of massless elds [21]. for the case of ads5 space it is expected that elds of iib supergravity
constitute lower spin multiplet of the innite tower of n = 8 supersymmetric massless higher
spin elds theory in ads5 background. in this perspective, we think that the results of this paper
can also get interesting applications to massless higher spin eld theory. note that ads5  s5 is
a unique space where the consistent string and massless higher spin eld theories may meet.

the boundary terms cancel. summing these contributions we get the desired relation (31).
