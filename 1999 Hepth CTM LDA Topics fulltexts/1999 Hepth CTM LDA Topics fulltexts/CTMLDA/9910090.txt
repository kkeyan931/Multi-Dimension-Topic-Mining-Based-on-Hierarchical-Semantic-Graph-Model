important questions related dynamics string theory remain addressed. instance: supersymmetry broken?, allow size couplings small volumes large, required lower values string scales? loop corrections modify analysis? would like briey comment issues supersymmetry breaking. interesting possibility use small instantons break supersymmetry. choose gauge bundle (n1, n2) instanton number n1 n2 = 24 shrink n2 anti-instantons. conguration breaks suspersymmetry completely. strongly coupled heterotic side, described m-theory compactied s1/z2, would correspond placing n2 anti-m5-branes one walls. supersymmetry broken eleven-dimensional planck scale. would need tev live anti-m5-branes, intermediate energies live opposite wall, somewhere live wall (gauge mediation). heterotic 6 theory scenario corresponding proposal {$9908072$} type vacua. obviously issue stability addressed models. another possibility break supersymmetry spontaneously wrapping m5- brane boundary wall around non-supersymmetric cycle {$9602070$} (the use ve- branes bulk hidden sector break supersymmetry suggested {$9901017$}). useful, instance, scenarios non-standard embedding {$9603003$} volume hidden wall calabiyau space large, making gauge interaction wall weaker needed induce non-perturbative eects able break supersymmetry desired scales. also small instantons localized dierent points k3, may act hidden sectors f-theory scenario {$9602120$}. observable hidden sectors communicate gravity so(32) e8 e8 gauge symmetries. finally, low values string scale, one may replace models discussed base p
