abstract

in our previous work (hep-th/9812044) we have proposed the sigma-model action ,
conjectured to be the nsr analogue of superstring theory on ads5s5. this sigma-model
is the nsr superstring action with potential term corresponding to the exotic 5-form vertex

operator (branelike state). this 5-form potential plays the role of cosmological term, eec-
tively curving the at space-time geometry to that of ads5s5. in this paper we study this
ansatz in more details and provide the derivation of the correlators of the four-dimensional

super yang-mills theory from the above mentioned sigma-model. in particular, we show

that the correlation function of two dilaton vertex operators in such a model reproduces

the well-known result of the two-point function in the n = 4 four-dimensional super yang-
mills theory: < f 2(x)f 2(y) > n 2

introduction

one of the most profound questions with regard to critical superstring theory in ten
dimensions is its relation to our four-dimensional world. superstring theory on ads5  s5,
whose low energy limit is the anti de sitter supergravity, is presumed to be related to d = 4

n = 4 super yang-mills theory due to the holography principle and to contain crucial

information about the large n gauge dynamics in four dimensions [1,2,3,4]. construction

of the action for this theory in the gs formalism has been considered in [5,6,7,8,9]. the gs
superstring action in the ads5  s5 metric is essentially non-linear and its quantization
in a straightforward way and computation of string scattering amplitudes seem to be

problematic.

in the previous work [10] we attempted to formulate the nsr version

of superstring theory on ads. namely, we have proposed the -model action, which
we claimede to be the nsr analogue of the superstring action on ads5  s5 in the gs
formalism. up to picture-changing transformation, the action for this sigma-model is given

by:

sn sr = z d2z[

x m xm +

1
2

(m m + m m)

(1)

+(x)p1p2p3p4 [ep1 p2 p3 p4 t yt + (ep1p2 p3 )  xp4 ] + ghosts]

where x m  (xp, yt) are ten-dimensional space-time coordinates, split in the 4 + 6 way,
p = 0, ..., 3; t = 4, ..., 9;  are worldsheet nsr fermions,  is bosonized superconformal

ghost eld.

in other words, the action (1) consists of a kinetic part which is just the

standard nsr free superstring action and the sigma-model type potential, determined by

the massless 5-form vertex operator, whose zero-momentum part is given by

v5 = p1...p4p1 ...p4t x t + ghosts

(2)

where  is constant. we will see, from analyzing the brst invariance condition that

 must infact be constant in the space-time, i.e. the potential term in the sigma-model

is cosmological-like. the brst-invariant 5-form massless vertex operator (2) does not

seem to correspond to any known physical particle in perturbative string spectrum. on

the contrary, it is related to the brane dynamics and space-time geometry in some very

intriguing way. in this paper we will discuss it in much more details. the related potential

part in the action (1) is presumed to play the role of cosmological term, eectively curving
the at ten-dimensional space-time to that of ads5  s5; the orientation of the four-
dimensional ads5 boundary in ten-dimensional minkowski space-time is thus related to
the polarization of the 5-form vertex operator (2). this note is organized as follows. we

1

begin with reviewing the arguments that relate the string theory on ads5s5 to the sigma-
model with the 5-form state (2). then we analyze the brst invariance of the ve-form

vertex operator. firstly, we nd that the brst invariance condition for the vertex operator

(2) restricts the dynamics of the scalar eld to four dimensions, longitudinal with respect

to the underlying three-brane; then the condition of the worldsheet conformal invariance

further restricts , requiring it to be constant (which is, in fact, related to n ). then we
compute dilatonic correlation functions in the sigma-model (1) (up to the order of 2)

(which, according to the ads/cft correspondents should be related with the correlators
of gauge-invariant f 2 operators in the d = 4 n = 4 sym). we nd, in particular, that
the two-point dilaton correlation function reproduces the < f 2f 2 > correlator in the

four-dimensional yang-mills, thus producing the evidence of the connection between the

brane-like sigma-model (1) and the large n limit of gauge theory.

nsr strings on ads and the brane-like sigma-model

let us briey recall the arguments of the previous paper that led us to relate the
sigma-model (1) to the ads superstrings. we start with the so(1, 3)  so(6)-invariant
ads5  s5 action in the gs formalism with xed kappa-symmetry. the action is given by
[6]:

s = 

1

2 z d2z{ggij(y2(ixp  2ipi)(jxp  2ipj) +

1
y2

iytjyt)
+4ij iyt tj}

(3)

on the other hand, as the ads5  s5 space is the near-horizon limit of the d3-brane
solution of the type iib supergravity in ten dimensions, one may alternatively view the
string theory on ads5  s5 as a theory of closed strings propagating in the f lat space-
time in the presence of n parallel d3-branes or, equivalently, open dirichlet strings. the

stress-energy tensor of a gs superstring in the at background is given by:

tij = m
i = ix m + im

i mj
i

m

(4)

because of the d3-brane presence the holomorphic and anti-holomorphic spinors 

and  are no longer independent; they are related as

 = (n )(0...3)

(5)

2

where (n ) is some constant depending on the number n of parallel d3-branes. now in

order to nd the nsr analogue of the superstring action in the presence of n parallel

d3-branes, one has to use the standard relation between gs space-time spinor  and the

nsr matter + ghost spin operator of zero conformal dimension:

(z) = e



2 (z) + ghosts

(6)

with the additional constraint (5). in the absence of the constraint (5) substituting (6) into

the gs expression (4) for the stress-energy tensor would have been given , up to picture-

changing, simply by the stress-energy tensor of a free nsr superstring.the constraint (5),

however, modies the result of the internal normal reordering that one has to perform in the
terms of the form  x in the gs stress-energy tensor (4). namely, using the relations
+
(5), (6) and the o.p.e. formula between spin operators:

5
4

: (z)(w) : 

(zw)



m1 ...mp


m1 ...m5 (w)

(zw)

5
4 p

pp

we nd that

: mxm := p1...p4ep1 ...p3xp4 + p1...p4ep1 ...p4tx t + ghosts

(7)

other terms in the stress-energy tensor (4) produce, up to picture changing, the standard

matter+ghost stress-energy tensor of free nsr theory. the action corresponding to the

stress tensor (7) is then the one given by the sigma-model (1). the above arguments
led us to suggest that the ads5  s5 structure of the the space-time may in fact be
depicted by the potential term in the sigma-model (1) corresponding to the exotic 5-

form branelike vertex (2).

in this paper we will test this conjecture by computing the

correlators in the sigma-model (1) and showing them to correspond to the four-dimensional

correlators in the large n gauge theory. first of all we would like to point out at some

important properties of the vertex operator v5. at zero momentum its form is given

by (2). at a given momentum k the straightforward generalization would be v5(k) =
(k)ep1 ...psip4t(x t+i(k)t)eikx ; however the brst invariance imposes constraints
in fact, it restricts k to the longitudinal directions, eectively
on possible values of k.

reducing the dynamics of the eld (k) to four dimensions ! the easiest way to see it

is to consider the internal singularities inside the vertex v5(k). recall that if one takes,
for instance, the vertex operator of a vector boson of the form em(k)(x m + ...)eikx,
there is the internal singularity due to the coupling between x and the exponent eikx :
x m(z)eikx (w)  km
zw eikx . to remove this internal singularity or, equivalently, to insure

3

the brst invariance of the vector vertex operator, one has to require the transversality
of the polarization vector at non-zero values of the momentum: kmem(k) = 0. in case of
the vertex operator v5 the 5-form state is brst invariant and the internal singularities
are absent if the transverse eld x t does not couple to the exponent at all, i.e.
the
exponent depends on the longitudinal components of the momentum only since the o.p.e.

x t(z)eik||x (w) is non-singular (k||x  kpx p; p = 0, 1, 2, 3).the same condition can be
derived in a straightforward way, by computing the commmutator of v5(k) with the brst

charge. therefore the brst-invariant 5-form vertex operator is purely longitudinal and

the scalar eld  is conned to four dimensions:

v5(k||) = (k||)p1...p4ep1...p4t( x t + i(k|| ) t)eik||x

(8)

however, this is not yet the end of the story. apart from the brst invariance of the v5

vertex, we also need to insure that the 5-form term in the sigma-model action (1) does not

violate the worldsheet conformal invariance. consider the stress tensor:

t (z) =

1
2

(x mxm + mm) + (x||)p1...p4ep1 ...p4tx t(z)

(9)

the two-point correlation function is given by:

< t (z)t (w) >=

1

2|z  w|4 (15 + 2 < (x||(z, z))(x||(w, w)) >)

(10)

(note that x t doesnt interact with . it follows that, in order to preserve the conformally

invariant form of the o.p.e. for two stress-energy tensors in the two-dimensional cft (that
is, there are no extra singularities coming from the o.p.e. (x||(z))(x||(w))) we have to
require that  is x||-independent, i.e.

it is constant in the four-dimensional longitudinal

subspace.that means that in the momentum space (k) must be inversely proportional to
the fourth power of |k|||:

where (+1)

correlation functions in the brane-like sigma-model

in our calculation of the two-point dilaton correlation in the sigma-model with the

5-form state we would like to use the slightly modied version of (1).namely, in order

to maintain the correct ghost number balance in correlation functions on the sphere it is

4

version

v (3) =

(3)

|k||4 p1...p4e3p1 ...p4t( x t + i(k|| ) t)eik||x||

(12)

where (1) and (3) are some k-independent constants to be specied later(in fact both

are related to the parameter n of the gauge theory) the generating functional for the

dilaton amplitude is then given by:

z(, ) = z d[x]d[][ghostsf ()]exp{z d2z

(xm x m + m m)

2

e)p1 ...p4t( x t + i(k||)t)eik||x + cc
+z d10kv(k)(k)}

(13)

where v (k) is the dilaton vertex operator at momentum k and f () is certain function

of picture-changing operator , necessary to insure the correct ghost number balance in

correlation functions.the function f () will be specied later. of course, it is possible to

rewrite the functional (13) in an equivalent form so that it would only contain the picture

+1 ve-form in the potential, but with the dierent measure deformation f (). we have

omitted the term with the full derivative of the three-form, which does not contribute to
correlators in our calculation; v(k) = x m x n(mn  kmkn  knkm)eikx is the dilaton
vertex operator; in this paper we will ignore the longitudinal (k, k) part of the dilaton

vertex since it is not important for the correlation functions.

the two-point dilaton correlation function is given by:

< v(p1)v(p2) > =

z(, )

(p1)(p2)|=0

(14)

the rst non-trivial (of order 2) contribution to this correlation function is given by

a =< v(p1)v(p2) > (+1)(3)z d4k||

(15)
as we shall observe, the term of order 2 in the expansion corresponds to the contribution

of the s-wave of the dilaton in the ads picture. as for higher order terms in the expansion

in , we shall argue that they correspond to higher partial waves of the dilaton eld on

5

the ads5. due to the momentum conservation, we have p2 = p1  k||

where  is euler gamma-function. it is remarkable that this amplitude depends exclusively

on the longitudinal projection of the dilaton momentum p1,i.e. the four-dimensional vector

7

p||
1 . that means that , upon the fourrier transform a(p1) will be the function of four space-

time coordinates, corresponding to the ads5 boundary (or the polarization of the 5-form

vertex).we observe that the structure of the two-dilaton amplitude involves the fourth

power of the four-dimensional momentum p||

1 (appearing as as the kinematic factor in the

nsr superstring four-point function) multiplied by the factor that will arise as a result

of the integration of the product of gamma-functions in the veneziano amplitude over the

where we have skipped less singular terms, possibly arising from the (p||

we mentioned before, the dependence on n is actually hidden in the factor of . since the
two-point correlator is proportional to n 2 one has to impose the condition (+1)(3)

where  is n-independent constant chosen in such a way that the product of 2 with

the regularized integral over w in (27) gives the correct normalization of the two-point

function in the four-dimensional super yang-mills theory. then we have

< f 2(x)f 2(y) >

(30)

at the rst glance the choice (29) of n-dependence of (+1) and (3) in (29) is not unique
(since it is only important that their product is proportional to n 2). however we shall

see that due to the ghost number conservation the n -dependence choice (29) is actually
uniquely xed by higher order corrections in 2 which we will discuss in the next section.

corrections in  as partial waves.

in this part we will make few comments on the structure of amplitudes arising as
a result of further expansion in 2 the contributions of order 2n correspond to 2n + 2-

point correlation functions integrated over 2n internal momenta of the ve-form vertices.

the kinematic factor correlation functions is some polynomial of degree 2n + 2 while the

integration over the internal momenta should hopefully produce the logarithm similarly to

10

the four-point case so the most singular part of the 2k contribution to the dilaton-dilaton
amplitude in the model (13) is proportional to  k2n+2lnk2 in the ads picture such a
momentum dependence corresponds to the contribution of the dilaton partial wave with the
angular momentum l = 2n 2. therefore the expansion in 2 in (13) seems to correspond
to the expansion in partial waves of the dilaton. also the comment should be made about

the n-dependence of the dilaton-dilaton amplitude. the choice (29) for the n-dependence
insures the proper n-dependence for the 4n-point amplitudes (proportional to 4n2),

i.e. the partial waves with even angular momenta. as for the waves with odd angular

momenta (corresponding to 4n + 2-point amplitudes) in the sigma-model, in order to take

them into account with the proper weight one has to insert the picture-changing factor in

the measure of functional integration so as to insure the odd momentum contributions are

correctly weighted. namely, one has to choose the picture-changing function f () in the

generating functional (13) as

f () = 1 +

2
n 2

(31)

provided that the parameters (3) and (+1) are dened as in (29). as we already

mentioned before, there exists also an equivalent way of writing the generating functional

(13) with only the picture +1 version of the ve-form present in the action:

2

2  n 2

exp{z d2z

(xm x m + m m)

+z d4k||

n

ep1 ...p4t( x t + i(k||)t)eik||x + cc
+z d10kv(k)(k)}

(32)

it is easy to show that the functional (32) and the functional (13) with the measure function
(31) and with (3) and (+1) dened in (29) produce equivalent series in .

conclusion

we have shown that the dilaton-dilaton amplitude in the ten-dimensional branelike
sigma-model (13), (32) reproduces the two-point correlation function < f 2f 2 > of the

n = 4 d = 4 super yang-mills theory. the natural project for the future is to compute

three and four-point correlators in the branelike sigma-model model (13), (32) in order to

verify their agreement with the corresponding computations in the ads supergravity (see,

for instance, [11,12,13,14,15]) the questions of particular interest would be reproducing the

logarithmic singularities in four-point correlators in the ads supergravity and the relation

11

between logarithms in ads correlators and anomalous dimensions of yang-mills operators.

another important object of interest is ads s-matrix [16,17] which can be understood in

terms of structure constants (or three-point correlation functions) of the conformal eld
theory on the worldsheet of superstring on ads5 s5. in accordance with our model these
functions are to be computed in the free theory with ve-form insertions. the nal obser-

vation to be made is that the veform state in the spectrum of nsr superstring in d = 10

seems to play the crucial role in building the space-time geometry. namely, the ve-form

vertex v5 (which denes a brst-invariant massless state in superstring theory in f lat
ten-dimensional space-time) integrated over its four-dimensional momentum , transforms
the at maximally supersymmetric space-time vacuum into the one of ads5  s5. thus
the anti-de-sitter structure of our space-time appears to have dynamical origin: it is the

consequence of the presence of exotic brane-like states in the spectrum of a superstring. we

hope that the computations outlined above will strengthen the ground for this hypothesis.
