abstract

in general, whitham dynamics involves innitely many parameters called whitham

times, but in the context of n = 2 supersymmetric yang-mills theory it can be re-

garded as a nite system by restricting the number of whitham times appropriately.

for example, in the case of su(r + 1) gauge theory without hypermultiplets, there

are r whitham times and they play an essential role in the theory. in this situation,

the generating meromorphic 1-form of the whitham hierarchy on seiberg-witten

curve is represented by a nite linear combination of meromorphic 1-forms associ-

ated with these whitham times, but it turns out that there are various dierential

relations among these dierentials. since these relations can be written only in

terms of the seiberg-witten 1-form, their consistency conditions are found to give

the picard-fuchs equations for the seiberg-witten periods.

i. introduction

thanks to the study of electro-magnetic duality initiated by seiberg and witten,1 the pre-

potential of the low energy eective action of n = 2 supersymmetric yang-mills theory was

turned out to be viewed as a function on a complex projective space having singularities when

the masses of charged particles vanish. this complex projective space can be identied with the

moduli space of a riemann surface determined by several physical requirements, thus the eec-

tive theory can be considered to be controlled by the geometry of moduli space of a riemann

surface.2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16 according to this observation, since the eective coupling con-

stants of the theory is interpreted as the period matrix of a riemann surface, determining the

period matrix from calculation of periods becomes equivalent to evaluate eective coupling con-

stants.

it is interesting that the instanton contributions to prepotential17 can be obtained from

the evaluation of periods and the prepotentials obtained in this way18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26 are known

to be consistent to the instanton calculus.26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33 in these studies, the method based on

picard-fuchs equations18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,34,35,36,37,38 played a crucial role.

however, on the one hand, the theory of prepotential often shows unexpected aspects behind the

eective theory. for example, it is known that the seiberg-witten solutions can be understood in

the framework of whitham theory.39,40 gorsky et al.41 noticed that the whitham dynamics in n = 2

yang-mills theory could be written essentially by only nite number of whitham times and found

that the second-order derivatives of prepotential over the whitham times could be represented by

an elliptic function associated with seiberg-witten curve.

however, we can further learn more aspects of whitham hierarchy in gauge theory from the basic

idea of gorsky et al..41 for instance, note that since the number of time variables of the hierarchy is

restricted to be nite the generating meromorphic 1-form of the whitham hierarchy is represented

by a nite linear combination of meromorphic 1-forms associated with these whitham times. then

we can expect that there must be closed dierential relations among these meromorphic dierentials

associated with whitham times. in fact, a detailed study supports this observation and the aim

of the paper is to show the consequence of these relations, especially, a connection to picard-fuchs

equations for the seiberg-witten periods.

the paper is organized as follows. in sec. ii, we briey summarize the whitham dynamics in

2

su(r + 1) gauge theory. in addition, following to gorsky et al.,41 we consider the situation that

the number of whitham times is nite. since the meromorphic 1-forms on seiberg-witten curve

consisting of the whitham hierarchy must be always represented by simply a linear combination of

abelian dierentials, we can expect the existence of dierential relations among these meromorphic

1-forms. in sec. iii, it is shown that such relations can be in fact found and as a result picard-

fuchs equations for the seiberg-witten periods are available from this view point. it should be noted

that the generating meromorphic dierential of the whitham hierarchy can be written in terms of

the seiberg-witten 1-form. this indicates that it is sucient to consider only the seiberg-witten

periods in order to calculate the periods of the whitham hierarchy. in sec. iv, it is shown that

the su(3) picard-fuchs equations for the seiberg-witten periods can be obtained from the picard-

fuchs equations with whitham times for the periods of the whitham hierarchy by considering the

specialization condition to seiberg-witten model. sec. v is a brief summary.

ii. whitham hierarchy in gauge theory

in this section, we briey sketch the relation between seiberg-witten solution and whitham

dynamics in the context of n = 2 supersymmetric yang-mills theory.39,40,41

a. seiberg-witten solution

to begin with, let us recall that the seiberg-witten curve in su(r + 1) gauge theory without

matter hypermultiplets2,3,4 is given by the characteristic equation

det[x  l()] = 0

(2.1)

of the lax operator l() for toda chain with r + 1 sites,39 where x is the eigenvalue of l() and

 is the spectral parameter. (2.1) can be rewritten in the form of spectral curve

p (x) = r+1

su(r + 1)(cid:18) +

1

(cid:19) ,

where su(r + 1) is the dynamical mass parameter and

p (x) := xr+1 

uixr+1i

r+1xi=2

3

(2.2)

(2.3)

represents the simple singularity of type ar with moduli ui. this spectral curve (2.2) can be further

rewritten in the familiar hyperelliptic form2,3,4

y2 = p 2  42,

where  := r+1

su(r + 1) and we have introduced

y := r+1

su(r + 1)(cid:18) 

1

(cid:19) .

(2.4)

(2.5)

note that the hyperelliptic curve (2.4) is a riemann surface of genus r.

for a study of riemann surface, it is often useful to consider the periods of abelian dierentials

over the 1-cycles on the surface. in the case at hand, we can take 2r 1-cycles (ai, bi) (i = 1,    , r)

on (2.4) as a canonical basis (bi are symplectic duals of ai), which can be expressed by using the

branching points of (2.4).

on the other hand, in order to interpret the components of period matrix constructed from

periods of abelian dierentials as the eective coupling constants, the combination of abelian

dierentials must be xed uniquely up to total derivatives. in addition, in general, there are three

kinds of abelian dierentials on a riemann surface, but that of the third kind is not required here

because we are considering a pure gauge theory. therefore, the expected meromorphic dierential

1-form is expressed by the abelian dierentials of the rst and second kinds, and the one satisfying

these requirements is called seiberg-witten dierential dssw, given by

dssw := x

d


= x

xp
y

dx,

(2.6)

where we have ignored the numerical normalization for simplicity, and then the seiberg-witten

periods are given by the loop integrals over the canonical cycles

ai :=iai

dssw, adi :=ibi

dssw.

(2.7)

note that dssw can be viewed as the canonical 1-form of the integrable system. in this way, we

can see the relation between seiberg-witten solution and integrable system.

b. whitham hierarchy

we have seen that the seiberg-witten solution has a connection to integrable system, but it can

be also viewed as a part of whitham theory of solitons on a riemann surface.

4

to see this,

let us recall that in general whitham theory consists of the following three

ingredients:42

 riemann surface of genus g.

 punctures on the surface.

 existence of local coordinates near the punctures.

gorsky et al.41 noticed that the meromorphic dierentials of the second kind dn of (n + 1)-

th order punctures (n > 0) on a riemann surface was dened up to a linear combination of

g holomorphic dierentials di and considered how to x this combination by taking two basic

requirements. the rst one was to require

iai

dn = 0

(2.8)

and the second one was to introduce new meromorphic dierentials dbn which enjoy the property

that their dierentiations over the moduli coincide with holomorphic dierentials.

according to their result,41 the dierential

ds :=

xn=1

tndbn =

gxi=1

idi +

tndn

xn=1

(2.9)

with innitely many parameters tn called whitham times is found to be the expected solution

which is suitable for applications to gauge theory. for this new meromorphic dierential ds, the

periods

i :=iai

ds, di :=ibi

ds

(2.10)

can be dened in a natural way.

next, in order to make a contact with seiberg-witten solution, gorsky et al.41 regarded the

riemann surface used here as the seiberg-witten hyperelliptic curve (2.4).

in such a situation, they found that the whitham hierarchy could be actually written by only

rst r time variables and gave an explicit expression of ds. in particular, in the case of su(r + 1)

gauge theory, n is restricted to n < r + 1. namely, in this situation, the periods (2.10) reduce to

i =

tniai

rxn=1

dbn, di =

tnibi

rxn=1

dbn

(2.11)

and dbn are given by

in this expression, p n/(r+1)

dbn = rn

d


, rn := p n/(r+1)

+

.

(2.12)

means the non-negative terms in the expansion of p n/(r+1) for a large

x, and in general, p n/(r+1) in su(r + 1) gauge theory is easily found to give

p n/(r+1) = xn

(2.13)

note that the periods are now represented by a nite linear combination of dbn because we

are considering only for n < r + 1 case. in addition, from (2.12), it is immediate to see that the

seiberg-witten solution is recovered at the point

(t1, t2, t3,    , tr) = (1, 0, 0,    , 0).

(2.14)

in fact, we nd db1 = dssw. of course, in this case, we have ds = dssw.

iii. picard-fuchs structure behind whitham hierarchy

a. relations among meromorphic dierentials

we have seen that ds is represented by a linear combination of dbn and also seen that db1 =
dssw. then, are dbn for n 6= 1 related to dssw? if we can nd any relation among them, the role

of the seiberg-witten solution in the whitham dynamics will be claried.

to nd an answer to this question, let us notice that any meromorphic dierential on a riemann

surface must be always written in terms of the basis of abelian dierentials on the surface. of

derivatives. however, actually, in the case of seiberg-witten riemann surface, we can show that

course, this must be true also for dbn for all n. therefore, if we consider a dierentiation of dbn
over moduli, it will be ultimately represented by a linear combination of various dbn and their
the derivatives of dbn for n > 1 are obtained from the seiberg-witten dierential db1. thus as the
result, we can conclude that ds is generated from db1 and accordingly the periods of ds can be
to see this more concretely, let us consider the case of db2 as an example. since the dierenti-
ations of db2 over moduli are

directly determined through the seiberg-witten periods themselves.

b. picard-fuchs equations from whitham hierarchy

if the derivatives of dbn over moduli for n > 1 are eliminated from the relations (3.3), (3.5) and
(3.6) by using dierentiations, the equations satised by db1 will be obtained. furthermore, since
db1 = dssw, we can identify such equations as picard-fuchs equations for seiberg-witten periods.

7

to see this, it is enough to consider the cross derivatives of dbn. for example, for db2, from
[2i  i2]db2 = 0, where i := /ui, we get
(r + 1  j)ujij+1 db1 = 0 (i 6= 2),
(r + 1)2i1  (r + 1  i)i+1 
r+1xj=2

which are the picard-fuchs equations obtained by several authors.26,37 for other dbn, we can con-

struct similar equations and, in fact, we can obtain the hierarchy of picard-fuchs equations as

(3.7)

follows:

(r + 1  i)ui(3i  2i+1)# db1 = 0,

(3.8)

note that the equations in (3.8) are all second-order equations and in some cases we can simplify

them by using (ij  pq)db1 = 0, where i + j = p + q.26,37

c. picard-fuchs equations as a complete system

of course, as a complete picard-fuchs system, it is not necessary to consider all equations in

(3.7) and (3.8). in general, since there are r moduli parameters in the su(r + 1) gauge theory, it is

sucient to extract at least r independent equations from them.

to see this, let us notice the equations in (3.7). since the number of the equations is r  1, one

more equation is necessary. however, we can not obtain the expected equation from (3.8) because

the equations presented there do not have the instanton corrections.

if the instanton correction

terms are not included in any one of picard-fuchs equations, the prepotential obtained from them

will not show the instanton corrections precisely. therefore, we require that the remaining one must

include instanton terms.

actually, such equation was recognized by ito and yang43 as the scaling relation. there, the

picard-fuchs system was realized by two kinds of equations, one of which is gauss-manin system

and the other is the scaling relation. since the gauss-manin system does not involve instanton

corrections, the situation looks like ours. therefore, also for our case, the scaling relation may be

used as the remaining picard-fuchs equation.

for this, let us consider the eulerian operator

e :=

r+1xi=2

iuii + (r + 1),

which acts as

edbn = ndbn

(3.9)

(3.10)

in terms of moduli derivatives can be easily accomplished by considering the squaring equation

for all n > 0. (3.10) indicates that the degree of dbn is n. realizing (3.10) as an equation only
(e  n)2dbn = 0.37,43
in this way, we can associate r independent picard-fuchs equations for db1.

iv. picard-fuchs equations with whitham times

9

a. the su(3) picard-fuchs equations

next, let us consider picard-fuchs equations for the periods (i, di) of whitham hierarchy. in

the case of r = 1, the resulting picard-fuchs equation takes the same form with the usual one18 up

to rescaling of t1. for this reason, we do not discuss this case, and instead, let us consider r = 2

case in order to nd a non-trivial example of picard-fuchs equations with whitham times.

in this case, the picard-fuchs equations with the whitham times are found to be in the form

lj(i, di) = 0,

though the derivation of picard-fuchs equations for other higher r is straightforward, the result

is turned out to be too lengthy and complicated, so we do not consider these cases in this paper.

b. specializations of su(3) picard-fuchs equations

it may be instructive to see specializations of (4.2). with the help of (2.14), it is straightforward

to make sure that the equations in (4.2) yield the usual su(3) picard-fuchs equations18 lj(ai, adi) =

0 for the seiberg-witten periods, which can be identied with appells f4 system44,45,46,47

note that the consistency condition of (4.3) leads to [u2

v  32

u](ai, adi) = 0, which coincides with

(3.7) for r = 2.

on the other hand, from (4.2) with (t1, t2) = (0, 1), we can also consider picard-fuchs equations

blj(hai db2,hbi db2) = 0 for the periods of db2, where
l1  bl1 := u(4u3 + 27v2  1082)2
l2  bl2 := (4u3 + 27v2  1082)2

v + 36uvuv  9vv + 12.

(4.4)

from (4.4), we can obtain a relation like that from (4.3), but the same equation is also available

from (3.3), provided db1/ui are eliminated from (3.3).

finally, note that we have

blj(i, di) = t1blj(cid:18)iai

db1,ibi

db1(cid:19) , lj(i, di) = t2lj(cid:18)iai

(4.5)

from (2.9), (4.3) and (4.4).

v. summary

in this paper, we have discussed the su(r + 1) gauge theory in the standpoint of whitham

dynamics and realized r  1 picard-fuchs equations for seiberg-witten periods as consistency

equations among meromorphic dierentials associated with whitham times. in addition, we have

used the scaling relation as the remaining independent equation in order to include the instanton

corrections. though the generalization to other cases except su(r + 1) group is straightforward, the

case of exceptional gauge groups would be interesting because there are two types of seiberg-witten

curves in these gauge theories.7,11,12,13,14,15,16 in particular, it may be interesting to know how the

dierences of physics expected from these two curves12,16,24,25 are reected in the whitham theory

and the picard-fuchs structure behind it.

of course, our construction of picard-fuchs equations may provide helpful informations not only

for these cases but also when we consider the relation among at coordinates,48,49 witten-dijkgraaf-

verlinde-verlinde equations50,51,52,53,54,55 and whitham hierarchy.39,40,41 we are now planning a dis-

cussion respect to this point.
