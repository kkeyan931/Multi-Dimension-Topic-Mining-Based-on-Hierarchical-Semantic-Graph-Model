abstract

this is a thesis/review article that combines some of the results of [1, 2, 3] with a short discussion of introductory
background material; an attempt has been made to present the work in a self-contained manner. the rst chapter
mostly targets readers who are vaguely familiar with traditional and contemporary string theory. chapter two
discusses in detail the thermodynamics of the 0 + 1 dimensional super yang-mills (sym) theory as an illustrative
example of the main ideas of the work. the third chapter outlines the phase structures of p + 1 dimensional sym
theories on tori for 1  p  5, and that of the d1d5 system; we avoid presenting the technical details of the
construction of these phase diagrams, focusing instead on the physics of the nal results. the last chapter discusses
the dynamics of the formation of boosted black holes in strongly coupled sym theory.

introduction

1.1 motivation

there are two main frameworks through which laws of physics can be studied. the rst is a microscopic setting;
one arranges a few asymptotic states in a given theory, throws them at each other, and observes the outcome. the
dynamics of the theory can in principle be decoded out of such experiments. another platform of exploration is
thermodynamics; one takes a large number of degrees of freedom, prepares a thermodynamic phase, and traces
the system as a function of the thermodynamic parameters.
in this latter setting, the important attributes of
the dynamics manifest themselves via critical phenomena. for example, the transition between the normal and
superconductive phases in a metal is the thermodynamic signature of the bound state formation phenomena between
pairs of electrons. phase transitions are typically reections of some of the most interesting characteristics of the
underlying microscopic physics. furthermore, the concepts of critical phenomena and thermodynamic phase structure
are fundamentally related to our modern understanding of the hierarchy and connections between physical theories.
it is now believed that the proper framework to correctly formulate a quantum theory of gravity has been
identied. as the most signicant recent evidence in support of this view has been the accounting for the degrees of
freedom responsible for the entropy of black holes [4, 5]. these ideas have emerged by embedding general relativity
into the low energy regime of a new theory of string theoretical origin. while a great deal remains to be understood
about this theory, signicant progress in unraveling its intricacies has been achieved in the past few years [6, 7, 8, 9].
the focus of this thesis is to study thermodynamics and critical phenomena in this fundamental theory.

let us shift the discussion away from gravitational physics and consider what appears to be the unrelated topic of
the thermodynamics of non-gravitational theories. consider a gas of non-gravitating but otherwise weakly interacting
particles in a square p dimensional box at xed and high temperature. accord g degrees of freedom for each cell
of the phase space of each particle. the interactions being very weak, the equation of state can be sketched easily.
the entropy must be extensive, so it is proportional to the volume of the box p, where  is the length of a side of
the box. assuming boltzmann statistics at high enough temperatures, the entropy is proportional to g. finally, the
power of the temperature is determined by dimensional analysis
s  gpt p ,

(1.1)

while the energy scales as e  t s. putting these together, we write the energy as a function of the entropy as

e =

p+1

p

s

n

2

p 

,

(1.2)

where, for future reference, we have set g = n 2. this equation of state may get subleading corrections due to the
interactions between the constituents of the gas; for weak coupling, a perturbative expansion in the coupling constant
can in principle be written. as we cool the system, the interactions may become strong, correlations between various
parts of the gas may grow stier, and a new phase may emerge after the crossing of a point of phase transition. all
of this may happen in a non-perturbative regime of the theory; questions regarding the state of the system then
generically become intractable by conventional physics. the focus of this thesis is to study such phenomena in a
certain class of non-gravitational theories.

introduction

the intended implication of our last comment is that the two separate issues that we raised, thermodynamics
of a gravitational theory and that of certain non-gravitational ones, are related. recent progress in string theory
indicates that gravity can be encoded in non-perturbative regimes of certain non-gravitational theories [8, 10, 9, 11, 12];
in particular, supersymmetric yang-mills theories, at strong coupling and for large ranks of the gauge group, appear to
describe elaborate quantum theories of gravity [9, 13]. this revelation can be qualied nothing less than remarkable.
it is leading to a fundamental reassessment of our understanding of gravity, space-time and quantum eld theories.
in the forthcoming sections of this chapter, we intend to systematically review these ideas.

an attempt has been made to present most of the necessary background physics in a self-contained manner. the
casual reader may focus on reading chapters 1, 2, and sections 3.1, 3.2, 4.1, and 4.2. further background material
can be found in appendices a and b. beyond this, the discussion may become considerably less entertaining for the
non-specialist.

1.2 basics

generically, a theory of particle physics identies a set of degrees of freedom, and proposes a prescription for their
dynamics and interactions. in practice, this setting is often a low energy approximation of more fundamental physics.
beyond the domain of relevance associated with the theory, new degrees of freedom may enter the game, modify
the dynamics, and the emerging picture may be endowed with a fundamentally dierent character. it is proposed
that string theory is a description of physics at the most fundamental level. the degrees of freedom and their
dynamics form a correct account of reality at the smallest possible length scales. simpler, less fundamental but
not necessarily uninteresting physics is to emerge from string theory at progressively lower energies.

consider an eleven dimensional supersymmetric theory, which we will refer to as m theory, entailing the dynamics
of certain avors of extended objects. the dimensionful parameters of m theory consist of h, c, and the gravitational
coupling in eleven dimensions 22
11. we choose units such that h = c = 1, and all dimensionful observables are
henceforth measured in units of length set by the planck scale 22
pl. the regime of low energy (with respect
to the planck scale) of this theory is n = 1, 11d supergravity, a well known and relatively simple supersymmetric
theory of gravity. the high energy dynamics of m theory is considerably better understood when it is compactied
to lower dimensions. particularly, compactifying on a circle of sub-planckian size leads to a ten dimensional theory
known as the type iia string theory. the latter is parameterized by the string length scale lstr , and a dimensionless
coupling constant gs < 1. these two variables are related to the parameters of the m theory from which the iia
theory descends by

where 2r11 is the circumference of the compactied dimension. the gravitational constant in ten dimensions is
then given by

the degrees of freedom of the iia string theory consist of:
 a one dimensional extended object, the closed string (f1); its tension is dened by

tf 1 =

1
2 .

(1.4)

(1.5)

 the magnetic dual of this string; this is a ve dimensional extended object referred to as the neveu-schwartz

ve brane (ns5). its tension is given by

 various p dimensional extended objects referred to as dp branes (dp). their tension is

with p an even integer for the type iia theory.

(1.6)

(1.7)

1.3. closed strings and gravity

5

all of these objects of the iia string theory originate from two objects in m theory; a membrane (m2), and its
magnetic dual, a ve brane (m5). their tension is set by the eleven dimensional planck scale. these are the only
objects allowed in eleven dimensional m theory by symmetry considerations.

f1 strings, ns5 branes and dp branes interact with each other in various well understood, as well as sometimes
ill-understood, ways. the f1 string mediates some of the interactions between the other types of objects, in addition
to interacting with other f1 strings. the strength of all these processes is tuned by gs  1. in this setting, the ns5
and dp branes are heavy compared to the fundamental string as can be seen from the tension formulae above. the
dynamics is therefore dominated by that of the string, and the physics is described by a perturbative expansion in
the string coupling gs.

the closed strings of the iia theory can break upon collision with the surface of a dp brane. the result of such a
process is an open string with its endpoints conned to the surface; this is the ripple created on the surface of the
brane as a result of the collision. more generally, the uctuations of the surface of excited dp branes are described
through the dynamics of a gas of such open strings. the time reversed version of the collision process just depicted
represents the evaporation from an excited dp brane.

a fundamental characteristic of string theory, non-local dynamics, is due to the fact that closed and open strings
are extended objects that can vibrate. at gs = 0, the spectrum of a vibrating string is like that of the quantized
harmonic oscillator, with each level representing a quantum degree of freedom propagating in ten dimensional space-
time. the spacing of the energy levels is set by the string tension tf 1; the ground state has zero energy, i.e. it
corresponds to massless quanta. the polarizations of the vibrational modes encode the spin of the quanta. string
theory thus involves an innite number of avors of particles with arbitrarily large mass and spin. at low energies
with respect to the string scale, the degrees of freedom consist of massless particles, the ground state modes of the
string spectrum, with the maximum bosonic spin being two.

string theory is endowed with a myriad of symmetries. in addition to the ten dimensional lorentz symmetry,
supersymmetry assures that the quanta associated with the spectrum of string excitations fall into supersymmetry
multiplets, with a pairing between bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom. furthermore, there exists strong
evidence for another class of symmetries underlying the theory. these are the so called dualities [7, 14, 15]. these
symmetries are of fundamental importance since they have lead to an understanding of the theory beyond the
perturbative expansion in gs. furthermore, the ve known avors of string theories, of which we have only described
the iia theory above, transform into each other under the action of these duality transformations. these connections
between the various theories become richer in structure as we compactify the string theories to lower dimensions.
the global picture that emerges suggests the existence of a single theory underlying m theory and all ve avors of
string theory. a slightly more detailed account of this subject is given in appendix b which the reader is encouraged
to consult. for the casual reader, we briey state the duality nomenclature we will make use of. s duality relates
a weakly coupled regime of a theory to a strongly coupled regime by inverting the string coupling gstr  1/gstr . t
duality relates a theory compactied on a circle of size r to one compactied on the dual circle of size /r. m-iia
duality identies the strongly coupled regime of iia theory with eleven dimensional m theory as described above.

the previous discussion, presented as such, may appear as a particularly imaginative excerpt from a fairy tale. it
is important to emphasize that the structure of the theory we outlined is severely restricted by various mathematical
and physical considerations. a handful of fundamental physical principles and a few intuitively motivated postulates
can be identied as the foundations of this elaborate theory.

1.3 closed strings and gravity

the spectrum of a free closed string consists of an innite tower of string vibrational modes, the levels separated by
1/lstr . focusing on dynamics at large distances with respect to the string scale simplies the theory dramatically.
a low energy eective description of a closed string theory is given by the dynamics of the quanta corresponding to
the zero energy ground states of the free string spectrum. hence we have a quantum eld theory of massless quanta
propagating in ten (or lower) dimensions and arranged into representations of the lorentz and supersymmetry
algebras. the symmetries typically uniquely determine the eld content of these quantum eld theories.

it is found that the low energy regime of closed string theories always yields a gravitational theory. it is then
implied that the diseases of quantum gravity at small length scales are cured by the emergence of the additional
degrees of freedom that one carelessly truncates away in the low energy approximation. a simplied and generic

form for the bosonic part of the low energy eective action that one encounters in a closed string theory is [16, 17]

the massless elds in this action are the graviton g , the dilaton , a 3-form eld strength h(3) of a 2-form gauge
eld coupling to the fundamental string, and a p + 2-form eld strength f(p+2) of a p + 1-form gauge eld coupling
to dp brane charge. r is the ricci scalar constructed from the metric g . shifting the dilaton in this action
corresponds to rescaling gs in 22
10. the string coupling can hence be thought of as a dynamical variable of the
theory, e  gstr . in this thesis, we will adopt the convention of absorbing the asymptotic value of the dilaton eld
in the denition of the string coupling; i.e. the dilaton  will always go to zero at large distances away from a source.
the action (1.8) admits classical solutions describing the geometry and gauge elds cast about various objects
that can arise in string theory. solutions describing black holes, fundamental strings, dp branes and ns5 branes are
known and have been extensively studied. in writing (1.8), it is assumed that scales of curvatures under consideration
are much smaller than the string scale so that the low energy truncation is consistent; and that the string coupling,
i.e. the dilaton, is small enough for perturbative string theory to make sense. classical solutions are then required
to respect these conditions.

consider the solution to the equations of motion of (1.8) describing the elds about n excited dp branes [18, 19]

where

ds2 = h 1/2(cid:0)hdt2 + d~y2

r = r0 denotes the location of the horizon; the dp branes are siting at r = 0. this horizon has nite area,
and hence it is associated with nite entropy; the corresponding geometry is referred to as black to remind us
of the thermodynamic nature of the state being described, reminiscent of black hole geometries. setting r0  0
yields the geometry of extremal dp branes, i.e. it is the zero temperature limit. it can be shown that half of the
supersymmetry generators leave this state unchanged; the r0 6= 0 solution however breaks all supersymmetries. the
variable q7p  n measures the amount of charge n carried by the solution under the corresponding eld strength.
we will often compactify the p space coordinates parallel to the surface of the dp branes, denoted in (1.9) by y(p),
on a torus t p of equal cycle sizes . the space transverse to the dp branes is mapped by the radial coordinate r
and the 8  p angular coordinates parameterizing an 8  p dimensional sphere; the metric on this sphere is denoted
by d2
by standard techniques of general relativity, one can calculate the entropy of (1.9), as well as its energy content as
measured by an observer at innity. the reader is referred to appendix a for some of the technical details regarding
such computations. we nd that the equation of state for the thermodynamic state comprised of n non-extremal
dp branes is given by [13, 20, 21]

8p. a pictorial representation of this dp brane geometry is shown in figure 1.1.

here e is the energy measured above the mass of the extremal branes, and s is the entropy. the specic heat for
this geometry is positive for p < 6. the system is metastable in the sense that it evaporates slowly through hawking
radiation.

the solution given in (1.9)-(1.11) is a faithful description of the dp branes for regions of space where the local
curvature scale is small relative to the string scale, and the string coupling gse < 1. elsewhere, the original
lagrangian is corrected by new physics of string theoretical origin. particularly, the size of these two observables,
curvature and coupling, as measured at the horizon r = r0 determine the window of validity of the equation of
state (1.13), since the latter is a statement extracted from geometrical information at the horizon. these two
restrictions are found to be

for the curvature scale at the horizon to be small with respect to 1/; we will refer to this latter criterion as the
horowitz-polchinski correspondence point. we thus have a gravitational description of the thermodynamic state of
n excited dp branes for certain entropies s, asymptotic string coupling gstr , and torus size .

1.4 open strings and yang-mills theories

we concluded the previous section by describing dp branes as seen by the low energy dynamics of closed string
theory. in this section, we focus on dp brane physics as emerging from the dynamics of the open strings propagating
on their surfaces.

as in the closed string sector, open string dynamics is simplied by studying the low energy regime, truncating
away the degrees of freedom associated with the vibrational modes of the open strings. this is again a quantum eld
theory of massless elds, quanta corresponding to the ground states of the open string spectrum. it is not however a
gravitational theory. we further restrict to the regime where the interactions of these quanta with the gravitational
closed string sector in the geometry projected by the dp branes is negligible; this is achieved by requiring that the
gravitational coupling is small. for n dp branes, the resulting theory is the dimensional reduction of n = 1 u (n )
ten dimensional super yang mills (sym) theory to the p + 1 dimensional world-volume of the n branes [16, 22, 23]

introduction

an intuitive insight can be obtained as to the meaning of the scalar elds in the sym action as follows. expanding
around a background consisting of diagonal scalar matrices x i, g2
y is found to tune the masses of the o-diagonal
modes of the scalar matrices. for the branes separated from each other by super-planckian distances, the diagonal
elements of these matrices can be thought of as representing the positions of the n branes in the transverse space to
their worldvolumes. the massive o-diagonal elements may then be integrated out in an adiabatic approximation
scheme to yield an eective description of the dynamics of the diagonals. remarkably, the resulting potential between
the diagonal modes is found to be of gravitational character. this is suggesting that closed string physics and space-
time are encoded in the low energy open string dynamics. for sub-planckian brane separations, this natural division
of roles between diagonal and o-diagonal matrix elements cannot be made. the physics is more complex, and
our intuitive picture of a smooth fabric for space falters. suggestions have been made that this is indicative of a
non-commutative structure of space-time at the eleven dimensional planck scale.

the action (1.16) receives corrections as we probe physics at string scale energies due to the eect of the stringy
vibrational modes of the open strings. interactions with the closed string sector further alter the dynamics. processes
involving closed strings from the surrounding bulk space breaking on the surface of the branes, and open strings
evaporating to closed strings, are tuned by the strength of the gravitational coupling. the action (1.16) however
becomes progressively better reection of the correct dp brane physics in the limit

  0 with g2

y , , e held xed,

(1.18)

henceforth referred to as the maldacena limit. e here is the energy scale of an excitation in the eld theory. the
gravitational coupling is given by

10  g4

y 7p  0 for p < 7 .

(1.19)

however, we need to be careful before we conclude that all is well for p < 7. this is because equation (1.17) implies
that in the maldacena limit gstr   for p > 3. this means that, for p odd, we need to look at the s dual
picture; for p even, we need to look at the gravitational coupling in eleven dimensions. as discussed in appendix b,
equation (1.19) is invariant under s and t duality transformations. hence, we only have to look at the p = 4 and
p = 6 cases more carefully. for p even and p > 3, the eleven dimensional m theory gravitational coupling is

y

 0 for p < 6.

(1.20)

combining these observations, we conclude that, for p < 6 and in the maldacena limit (1.18), both gravitational
and stringy eects are scaled out, while the parameters of the eld theory are held xed. this statement denes a
certain regime of energy and string coupling of interest from the perspective of our eld theory.

we dene the eective dimensionless coupling at large n , with t hooft-like scaling, by

where t is the substringy energy scale at which we study a given process with the action (1.16). we see three
dierent scenarios arising as a function of p that need to be distinguished:

e  g2
g2

y n t p3,

(1.21)

 for p < 3, the theory is super-renormalizable and well dened in the uv 1. the eective yang-mills coupling

increases at low energies.

 for p = 3, we have 3 + 1d n = 4 sym theory. this is a superconformal theory; its beta function vanishes.
 for 3 < p < 6, the yang-mills coupling is irrelevant; it blows up at high energies, indicating an ill-dened theory
at small length scales. a non-renormalizable theory arising at low energies may be thought of as a descendent
from an otherwise more elaborate but well-dened theory in the uv; at higher energies, the degrees of freedom
of the uv theory set in and regularize the dynamics. it is believed that the sym theories for 3 < p < 6 are
connected in the uv to theories describing the dynamics of the ns5 branes of string theory. these connections
will be tackled at slightly greater length in section 1.5.

 for 6  p  9, the situation is more complicated. as we saw above, the gravitational coupling does not vanish
indicating that the closed string sector does not decouple from the open string dynamics. except for p = 6,
these cases will be omitted from the discussion in this thesis.

1note that the uv cuto must always be smaller than the string scale, which is taken to innity in the maldacena limit.

1.5. comments on five brane theories

9

consider exciting a gas of quanta in these sym theories. the variable t in equation (1.21) denotes then the
temperature. for ge  1, we have a weakly interacting gas of bosons and fermions. as discussed in the introduction,
the equation of state of the nite temperature vacuum in this regime is given by equation (1.2). perturbation theory
can be applied to rene this free gas picture. as the temperature is tuned past ge  1, our understanding of the
dynamics via standard eld theoretical means breaks down. the physics of the theory beyond this point is then a
mystery. a mystery, that is, until the advent of maldacenas conjecture.

1.5 comments on ve brane theories

we observed in the previous section that p + 1 dimensional sym theories for 3 < p < 6 are non-renormalizable; i.e.
they are low energy eective descriptions of physics of possibly dierent character that is well dened at short length
scales. this uv physics can be unraveled by making use of some of the special symmetries arising in string theories.
particularly, it is known that certain duality transformations of string theories shue d4 branes with m5 branes, d5
branes with ns5 branes, and ns5 branes with m5 branes (see appendix b). this suggests that 4 + 1d and 5 + 1d
sym theories may connect in the uv with theories describing the dynamics of ve-branes. these theories are not
very well understood; we will try to outline in this section a few facts known about them [24, 25, 26, 27, 28].

we remind the reader that the ns5 brane is a ve dimensional extended object that arises in string theories as
the magnetic dual of the f1 string. its dynamics appears to be fundamentally dierent from that of dp branes. in
particular, one does not have a picture of open strings propagating on the ns5 brane surface describing ripples of
excitations. there exists however a less understood picture of closed strings living in the 5 + 1d world-volume of the
ns5 brane; their dynamics is presumably describing the uctuations of the brane. this little closed string theory
is not gravitational and is necessarily a non-local theory.

there are two avors of ns5 branes; the one in iia theory and the one in iib theory, related to each other by
t duality transformations. the ns5 brane of the iia theory (ns5a) descends from the m theory ve brane, the
magnetic dual of the m theory membrane. the 6d string theory on its surface has (2, 0) supersymmetry with sixteen
supersymmetry generators. compactifying this theory on a substringy circle (i.e. wrapping the ns5a on the circle)
yields 4 + 1d sym theory. the uncompactied theory appears at low energies and for well-separated branes as a
5 + 1d eld theory of free massless elds forming a tensor multiplet of supersymmetry. the bosonic eld content
of this theory is given by ve scalars and an anti-selfdual two-form. the tension of the little strings is set by the
tension of a membrane wrapping the m theory circle and ending on the ve brane. we will see that it is held xed
in the maldacena limit, signaling that the innite tower of little string vibrational modes does not decouple in the
energy regime of interest; this signals that we will be dealing with non-local theories 2 arising in the uv of certain
local sym theories. the ns5 brane of the iib theory (ns5b) is a 6d (1, 1) conformal eld theory related to the
(2, 0) theory by an odd number of t dualities. at low energies, it is described by 5 + 1d sym theory.

figure 1.2 is a schematic diagram summarizing our comments in this section. when we will be studying the
thermodynamics of 4 + 1d and 5 + 1d sym theories, it will be appropriate to label the discussion as an analysis of
the thermodynamics of ve brane theories.

1.6 maldacenas conjecture

in the previous sections, we outlined two dierent descriptions for a conguration of excited dp branes. one is
through gravity, a picture consisting of a space-time curved by the energy content of the branes; the other is through
the nite temperature vacuum of a non-gravitational sym or little string theory. in the maldacena limit, which
denes a certain low energy regime, the latter picture is in focus. there are two questions that arise after these
observations. first, what does maldacenas energy regime correspond to in the geometrical picture? and second,
how does this energy regime relate to the one encountered on the geometry side in equations (1.13),
(1.14) and
(1.15)?

consider perturbations propagating in the extremal background geometry given by the metric (1.9) with r0 = 0.
we may for example consider excitations in the supergravity elds, or stringy modes beyond the supergravity
multiplet. the background geometry typically enforces a dispersion relation relating the energy of the perturbation
as measured by an observer at innity and the region of the background geometry where the eld of the perturbation

2 the non-locality is of spatial extent set by the length scale determined by the little string tension.

is predominantly supported. consider for instance exciting the extremal state by knocking out one of the n dp
branes of the bound system away from r = 0. a measure of the energy of this excitation can be obtained by taking
a snapshot of projected dp brane at its maximum radial extent r from the rest of the system. in the sym, this
corresponds to giving a pronounced vev to a diagonal entry in the scalar matrices. on the geometry side, we have
a string radially stretched from the extremal zero area horizon at r = 0 to a coordinate distance r away. using the
metric (1.9), one nds that the energy of this stretched string as measured at innity is proportional to r/. if we
identify this with the energy of the excitation in the eld theory, we see that that lower energy excitations tend to sit
closer to the center of the geometry. crudely put, the higher the energy of a perturbation of the extremal state, the
farther is the extent in the transverse space of the jet or ripple produced on the dp branes. the maldacena energy
regime (1.18) then corresponds to focusing on physics near the core of the dp brane geometry. equation (1.18)
essentially establishes a uv cuto on the open string theory, and corresponds to restricting dynamics in the closed
string sector to the background geometry of the near horizon region of the extremal dp brane solution. this close-
up geometry of the horizon that corresponds to the maldacena energy regime (1.18) is easily obtained from the
metric (1.9) by dropping the 1 in the harmonic function h of (1.12). having made these observations, maldacena
proposed the following [9, 29]:

maldacenas conjecture3: string theory in the background geometry of the near horizon region of the extremal

dp branes is encoded in the corresponding sym theory.

by this it is meant that the partition functions given by the two pictures are equal. the conjecture suggests a
one to one correspondence between excitations of the background geometry and excitations in the sym quantum
eld theory. this is essentially an equivalence between closed string theory (the gravitational side) and open string
theory (the sym side). note that one is to truncate the open string dynamics to the ground states, while one is to
keep the innite tower of closed string excitations propagating in the dp brane background. this is because, in the
maldacena limit, the ratio of string scale proper energy of a perturbation in the bulk space to its energy measured
at innity (i.e. the energy in the open string sector) is nite, i.e. independent of lstr .

we focus on perturbations of the extremal background that form metastable congurations corresponding to
the black solutions (i.e. r0 6= 0) of equation (1.9) [13]. this amounts to exciting the extremal dp branes to nite
temperature, and therefore corresponds to studying a certain thermodynamic phase of the sym theory. maldacenas
limit zooms onto physics in the near horizon region r = r0. our previous picture of a dp brane projected from the
core as describing an excitation of the extremal state suggests the following: in this nite temperature scenario, the
horizon r = r0 may denote, roughly, the extent in the transverse space of a halo due to a gas of ripples on the surface
of the dp branes. this observation may indicate that the standard classical procedure to analytically continue the
black geometry smoothly past the horizon is not necessarily well justied. the equation of state of this phase of the

3more general versions of this statement have been proposed and studied; in this thesis, we conne our discussion to the dp brane

case exclusively.

(1.22)

,

where we have written it in terms of the eld theory parameters. we see that, in the maldacena energy regime (1.18),
this energy scale is kept in focus. equation (1.22) can be trusted for a window of entropies such that the curvature
scale and the dilaton measured at the horizon are small, as we saw in equations (1.14) and (1.15). in the eld theory
variables, these become respectively

(1.23)

(1.24)

we see that this entropy/energy window is a subset of maldacenas energy regime, and that the geometrical phase
arises in a non-perturbative regime of the sym theory. within this window, the equation of state of the black
geometry then describes a certain phase of the sym theory. the conjecture implies that the analysis of the stability
of such black geometries can be translated to an analysis of critical phenomema in the sym theory.

we thus have a powerful geometrical tool to explore the thermodynamics of sym or little string theories beyond
the connes of pertubration theory. we will make use of it to systematically map out the thermodynamic phase
diagrams of these theories.

1.7 the matrix conjecture

prior to maldacenas conjecture, another proposal suggested a correspondence between gravitational and sym the-
ories. the matrix conjecture [8, 10] proposed that discrete light cone quantized 4 (dlcq) m theory on a p
dimensional torus is encoded in p + 1d sym theory. our thermodynamic analysis will lead to a better understanding
of this statement; we will conclude that the content of this conjecture is a subset of maldacenas proposal. we here
briey review the matrix conjecture for future reference. the casual reader may quickely browse through this section
only to get accustomed to some of the nomenclature we will make use of later.

a convenient way to summarize the matrix theory conjecture is to say that dlcq m-theory on t p with n
units of longitudinal momentum is a particular regime of an auxiliary m-theory which freezes the dynamics onto
a subsector of that theory. consider such an m-theory, with eleven-dimensional planck scale l pl (which we denote
(m,l pl)) on a p + 1d dimensional torus of radii ri, i = 1 . . . p, and r the m-theory circle of reduction to type iia
string theory, in the limiting regime

(1.27)

and n units of momentum along r. it is proposed that [8, 10]

4the dlcq of a theory is obtained by compactifying the theory on a light-like circle. we single out the combination x = (x t)/2
and treat x+ as the new time variable. its canonical variable p = p+  elc is called the light-cone hamiltonian. the coordinate
x = x+ is compactied on a circle of size 2r+, and the longitudinal momentum p is quantized in units of 1/r+. the relativistic
dispersion relation e2  p2  ~p

2 = m 2 then takes the non-relativistic form

elc =

(1.25)

quanta propagating in this frame carry only positive longitudinal momentum p. this simplies the physics by restricting the number
of degrees of freedom in a given sector of total longitudinal momentum to a nite number.

it was argued in [30] that the dlcq frame can be reached by a combination of an innite boost and compactication on a vanishingly
small cycle. the longitudinal momentum p11 = n/r11   (with n xed) is made of order the energy e in the boosted frame yielding
the dispersion relation
(1.26)
where eim f  0 with eim f p11 held xed. one then identies p11 with p, and eim f with elc yielding equation (1.25). given this
mapping, the reader is warned that, in the upcoming chapters, we freely mix the use of the innitely boosted picture with that of the
dlcq.

 this theory is equivalent to an (m ,lpl) theory on the dlcq background we denote by d1,1 t p r9p, where
d1,1 is a 1 + 1 dimensional subspace compactied on a lightlike circle of radius r+, and the torus t p has radii

conjecture proposes that dlcq m theory is described by the theory of the little strings living on wrapped ve branes. all these issues
are best understood in a unied framework through maldacenas conjecture; this is the approach we adopt in this thesis.

chapter 2

a simple phase diagram

we concluded in the previous chapter that the thermodynamic state described by the dp brane geometry given
by (1.9) with equation of state (1.13) corresponds to a certain phase in the thermodynamic phase diagram of p + 1d
sym. this is obviously a dierent phase than the one accesible by perturbation theory, whose equation of state scales
as (1.2). in this chapter, we focus on the case of d0 branes (p = 0), and we investigate the transition between the
perturbative and geometrical phases. in the process, we will map the thermodynamic phase diagram of the 0 + 1d
sym theory well into non-perturbative regimes. we will present a relatively detailed analysis since this simple case
can be used to illustrate some of the basic ideas involved in the more elaborate thermodynamic phase diagrams we
will encounter in the next chapter.

2.1 thermodynamics of d0 branes

we are considering 0 + 1d sym theory which describes the dynamics of d0 branes in iia string theory. we take the
number of d0 branes n to be much greater than one. the eective yang-mills coupling is given by equation (1.21);
using equation (1.22) and e  t s with p set to zero, this yields

g2

e (cid:18) n 2

s (cid:19)5/3

,

(2.1)

at entropies much greater than n 2, we see that the system is in a weakly coupled phase. we have a quantum
mechanical system with n 2 weakly interacting particles propagating in an innite volume; this is because we have
not restricted the sym scalars, the coordinates of the particles, to live within a conned region. as such, the stability
of such a phase is at issue; the physics of this phase will be discussed in greater detail below. as the interactions
become strong at s  n 2, the dynamics becomes more interesting; we expect to form a ball of strongly interacting
particles that are conned to a region of space by virtue of these strong interactions. putting the system in a box is
not necessary anymore if we are content to describe metastable phases that evaporate slowly.

we lower the entropy of our system past s  n 2, venturing into non-perturbative dynamics g2

figure 2.1: the transition between a localized boosted black hole and a black wave. the horizontal axis in these
pictures is the m theory cycle of size r11 .

maldacenas conjecture states that this is a phase in 0 + 1d sym quantum mechanics. it is a long-lived, metastable
thermodynamic phase that evaporates slowly by hawking radiation. let us next look closer to the criteria making
this geometrical picture a physically consistent one. its curvature scale is set by the angular part of the metric. we
require that this scale, as measured at the horizon r0, be less than 1/. this yields the condition

h 1/2r2(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)r=r0

>   s < n 2 .

(2.6)

we see that the geometrical phase complements the perturbative regime; for s > n 2, we have the phase described by
perturbation theory and for s < n 2, strongly coupled dynamics forces the system into another phase with equation
of state (2.5). the point s  n 2 is most likely a phase transition line, but our analysis is crude enough not to allow
us to study the details of this transition. our entire discussion in this thesis will suer from this deciency. we will
be able to track the bulk phase structure of the phase diagrams and the rough scaling of the critical curves. we will
make no attempt at going into a more detailed analysis of these critical phenomena.

the next task is to determine what happens to the strongly coupled phase as we decrease the entropy further.

to answer this, we need to look at the dilaton

as discussed in the previous chapter, consistency of the geometrical description requires us to assure that gstr e(cid:12)(cid:12)r=r0 

1; i.e. perturbative string theory was assumed in deriving the low energy supergravity action. this yields the condi-
tion

e = h 3/4 .

(2.7)

s > n 8/7 .

(2.8)

for lower entropies, the size of the eleventh dimension of m theory is of super-planckian size (c.f. equation (1.3)).
the full eleven dimensional nature of the underlying dynamics must be taken into account. the connection between
m and iia theories at the low energy supergravity level is simply through the prescription of dimensional reduction
that is commonly used in the compactication of supergravity theories. a few technical details can be found in
appendix b. the eleven dimensional metric from which our iia metric (2.2) descends is found to be

ds2

11 = h(dx11  dt)2 + dx2

11  dt2 + h 1(1  h)dt2 + h1dr2 + r2d2
8 .

(2.9)

here x11 lives on a circle of size 2r11, and the m theory planck scale is denoted by lpl. this is simply a black wave
propagating along x11 (we label it w11 for future reference). d0 branes of iia theory map onto gravitational waves
in m theory. the equation of state is unchanged; we are describing the same physics using a new setting whose low
energy dynamics we can trust beyond the perturbative string theory regime.

the question now becomes what happens to this eleven dimensional geometry as we lower the entropy further.
this is answered by studying the stability of the black wave geometry. it is known that a black wave in a box is
unstable toward collapse into a boosted black hole localized in the box; the transition occurs at the point where the
boosted black hole has less free energy. as we lower the entropy, we cool the black wave enough that the preferred
conguration is one which is localized in the box along the direction of wave propagation. alternatively, a boosted
black hole in a box can be said to smear itself into a black wave geometry as the entropy is raised past the point
where the size of the horizon is the size of the box. this process is sketched in figure 2.1.

figure 2.2: the thermodynamic phase diagram of 0 + 1d sym. the dotted line represents the lift to m theory. we
have a total of three phases: a perturbative quantum mechanics phase, a phase of black d0 branes (comprised of
two geometrical patches), and a phase of a boosted eleven dimensional black hole .

the boosted black hole geometry is obtained by applying the appropriate lorentz boost transformation on a
schwarzchild black hole (see appendix a). the equation of state of a black hole of mass m boosted to a large
momentum p11 = n/r11 = n/(gstr lstr ) is given by

following the comments in the footnote of section 1.7. note that we are identifying the sym hamiltonian with the
light cone energy in m theory. we can nd the transition point between this phase and the black wave phase by
either minimizing the gibbs energies between (2.10) and (2.5)1, or by equating the size of the box x11 as measured
at the horizon to the size of the horizon. this yields the point of transition at

s  n .

(2.11)

the conclusion is that, at s  n , there is a transition between the phase described by the equation of state (2.5),
and the phase of a boosted black hole described by the equation of state (2.10). for s < n , the 0 + 1d sym theory is
in a thermodynamic state which is a boosted black hole, with the boost momentum related to the rank of the gauge
group. this phase, unlike that of a stationary black hole, has positive specic heat. figure 2.2 depicts graphically
the phase diagram we have been constructing.

this simple example illustrates the basic idea we will make use of in the next chapter in mapping the thermody-
namic phase diagrams of more elaborate cases. we use maldacenas conjecture to identify phases in sym theories
which have strongly coupled dynamics with dp brane geometries; we analyze the stability and validity of these
geometrical phases, using the duality symmetries if needed, and import the conclusions to sym thermodynamics.
we will be able to systematically chart in this manner the phase diagrams of sym and little string theories on tori.
a few more comments regarding the role of the vevs of the scalars in the dynamics are in order. we saw that
the perturbative 0 + 1d sym phase consists of a gas of n 2 weakly coupled particles in innite volume. as such, its
thermodynamics is well dened provided that the kinetic energy content of the zero modes of this gas is comparable
to the potential energy content; we then can expect that a long lived metastable phase exists, a ball of a gas conned
to a region of space by virtue of the weak interactions between the constituents. the existence of a potential strong
enough to bind the zero modes is crucial in the 0 + 1d case since the only dynamics available is one that can probe the
innite extent of the space. whether a stable or metastable phase sits on the left of figure 2.2 is then in principle left
as an open issue. we focus instead on the p + 1d sym theories with p 6= 0, where this problem will be considerably
milder. these cases involve the physics of dp branes wrapped on a torus. the dierence between the two scenarios
is analoguous to the following more mundane situations: on the one hand, consider a gas of a certain number of
particles propagating on the innite two dimensional plane; on the other hand, consider a vibrating rubber band
wrapping a cylinder. the thermodynamics of the former case is similar to the 0 + 1d sym case we discussed. in
the rubber band scenario however, the physics involves in addition the thermodynamics of the vibrational modes,
quanta propagating along the band (modding out the dynamics of the center of mass of the rubber band, which
readily explores the longitudinal innite extent of the cylinder). the contribution to the free energy of this sector of
the dynamics dominates the thermodynamics; by increasing the temperature in the p + 1d sym case with p 6= 0, we
will see that one transfers dynamics to the uctuations on the surface of the wrapped dp branes; this phenomena

1we are only tracking the scaling of the transition curves; distinction between free, gibbs or internal energy is not necessary for such

purposes.

16

chapter 2. a simple phase diagram

will happen at s  n 2. the perturbative p + 1d sym phases for p 6= 0 will be better dened in this sense; for scaling
purposes, they can be readily approximated by systems of free particles living on a torus.
typically, phases involving weakly interacting dynamics, such as the perturbative sym gas or, more interestingly,
the matrix string, abut black geometrical phases on our phase diagrams. we expect that the vevs of the scalars
in the weakly coupled phases explore the extent of the non-compact space for arbitrarily high temperatures. it is
not obvious that, starting from such a phase and moving toward strongly coupled dynamics, we are guaranteed to
collapse the system into one of the black geometries we encounter along the traced path. the system may have spread
itself into large volumes of the transverse space (or an innite volume in the pathological 0 + 1d sym case) such
that the interactions, which generically fall in strength with distance, are eectively too weak to lead to a collapse
at the point identied on the phase diagram. this phenomena will be explored in detail in chapter 4. our phase
diagrams are faithful representation of the physics if we trace paths starting from black objects and moving toward
weakly coupled phases; such paths are not necessary reversible. in chapter 4, we map out a thermodynamic phase
diagram which can be navigated with reversible processes. note that this physics is again intimately tied with our
choice not to restrict the scalar vevs to a nite region of space.

before we conclude this chapter, let us reect on the boosted m theory phases (the wave w11 and the black hole)
that arose at low entropies. using the m-iia relations (1.3), we cast the maldacena limit in the parameters of this
m theory; this yields

lpl  0 with

l 2
pl
r11

held xed.

(2.12)

we see that this is identical to the energy regime of the matrix conjecture (1.27); i.e. the matrix regime is a statement
dual to the maldacena limit, where the duality at play here is the m theory-iia connection. another map between
the two limits (involving a t duality transformation) was given in the case of p + 1d sym with p 6= 0 in section 1.7.
we will see how this relation gets embedded in the phase diagrams of the next chapter. the conclusion is the same:
the maldacena and matrix energy regimes are dual to each other. the low entropy phases of our diagrams live in
dlcq m theory. the charge n carried by the d0 branes is mapped onto the momentum in the light-cone direction.
in this sense, maldacenas conjecture leads to the matrix proposal.

given the elaborate web of dualities between the various string theories that connect vacua of the underlying
theory, a conjecture relating a eld theory to string theory in a given background vacuum is naturally extended to
a statement relating this eld theory to string/m theory on any dual background. given that one typically needs
to accord a window of energy or of the thermodynamic parameter space to a given background vacuum, the eld
theory encodes naturally string/m theory in dierent backgrounds for dierent regimes of energy or temperature. a
thermodynamic phase diagram constructed in this manner paints a global picture of the thermodynamic vacuum of
a single theory; the role of the web of dualities in patching various string theories into one big theory metamorphoses
into the role of combining various thermodynamical vacua of a single sym theory into a single phase diagram. we
see in the 0 + 1d sym phase diagram a very simple realization of these ideas.

2.2 the matrix black hole

we saw in the previous sections that a boosted black hole, or a black hole in dlcq m theory, is a thermodynamic
phase of 0 + 1d sym theory. we will nd it a generic phase arising at low entropies in p + 1d sym theories with
p  6. the question then arises as to how this phase is realized as excitations of the sym elds at xed temperature
or entropy. a model for this was proposed in [31, 32, 33] which we now summarize.
at low entropies s < n , consider the scenario where the sym dynamics is dominated by that of the zero modes
of the elds with the eective yang-mills coupling being large. assuming that the diagonal elements of the scalars
x i do not take degenerate values, the o-diagonal modes are massive with the mass scale tuned by the yang-mills
coupling. for large coupling, these degrees of freedom can be integrated out to yield an eective low energy potential
between the diagonal elements. the latter represent, as discussed earlier, the coordinates of n d0 branes, each
with mass 1/r11 (c.f. equations (1.3) and (1.7)). so, we have a gas of n d0 branes interacting with some eective
potential. it is proposed that, for s < n , there is a stable thermodynamic state in the sym that can be modelled
as a gas of k clusters of d0 branes, each with n/k d0 branes. it is assumed that the physics of this model is
dominated by the center of mass dynamics of these clusters of d0 branes. the clustering phenomena of the d0
branes into nuclei with n/k partons is in principle an unknown, an assumption that will be justied in the analysis

(2.14)

where r is the typical seperation between the clusters, or the size of the system. we are considering a boosted black
hole in m theory on a p dimensional torus t p of equal cycle sizes r; this changes the gravitational coupling and the
power of the cluster seperation distance r as shown. we have also enhanced the interaction by a factor n/k. at
this stage, this is an assumption; it will be justied in chapter 4 and appendix f.

we now make use of three additional ingredients. we assume that the clusters are distinguishable from each
other. we then have the entropy of the gas scaling as s  k. we assume that the wavefunctions of the clusters
saturate the quantum mechanical uncertainty bound

puting things together in equation (2.13) or (2.14), we get that the total energy for this gas scales as

,

where we have assumed in the last step that the sym hamiltonian is the light-cone energy as in equation (1.25).
the mass m obtained in this equation, up to numerical coecients, is that of a schwarzchild black hole in an eleven
dimensional space-time compactied on a torus t p of size r. the proposed model then reproduces black hole physics
from sym theory. various assumptions made in constructing this model will be justied in the analysis of chapter 4.

2.3 the matrix string

another phase that we will encounter in the various phase diagrams is that of the matrix string. this is a highly
excited string in dlcq string theory with entropy s  1. its equation of state has the light-cone structure (1.25)

e =

m 2

,

where m 2 is the mass of a free string at a level of degeneracy es

m 2 

s2


.

(2.18)

(2.19)

this phase arises, for example, in the ir of 1 + 1d sym theory where a free conformal eld theory is believed to sit.
an explicit realization of the free string as excitations in this theory was given [34, 35]. we summarize briey this
proposal.

in the ir, the relevant yang-mills coupling is large; this makes the commutator terms in the action (1.16) costly
in energy. congurations where all matrix elds are diagonal are energetically favoured. consider diagonal matrix
congurations for the scalars x i; we ignore the gauge elds on the world-sheet, even though these have interesting
roles to play in the dynamics and the spectrum [36, 37, 38, 39]. gauge transformations that permute the diagonal

18

chapter 2. a simple phase diagram

elements form a symmetry of this setup. in general, we need to consider boundary conditions on the scalar matrices
allowing for such discrete gauge transformations

x i(y + ) = gx i(y)g1 ,

(2.20)

where g is an n  n matrix permuting the diagonal elements. all such matrices g can be decomposed into transfor-
mations involving the operation of cycling acting on subsets of the diagonal elements. without loss of generality, we
consider g as a cyclic transformation in zn ; the boundary condition above then sews the various diagonal elements
together into one long string with world-sheet length n , instead of the periodicity  that one obtains from the
simpler condition x i(y + ) = x i(y). this is a basic technique known, for example, from string theory on orbifolds.
the picture depicts a iia string encoded in the ir of the 1 + 1d sym as a d string wrapping, like a slinky, n times
a circle which is seen as the m cycle from which the iia string theory descends. note that the so(8) symmetry of the
scalar elds is precisely the corresponding symmetry of iia string theory in the light-cone frame. it is then easy to
show that the quantized hamiltonian of (1.16) leads to the free light-cone string spectrum (2.18) with p+ = n/r+.
the appearance of a matrix string with s  1 in our phase diagrams implies that there exists rich dynamics
that seeds a certain ordering, a zn holonomy, in the sym excitations as we navigate past certain critical curves.
the closest analogy may be a gas-solid phase transition, where the symmetries of the emerging lattice encode
characteristics of the underlying microscopic dynamics. the picture of the matrix string we outlined here will be an
integral part of our discussion in chapter 4.

chapter 3

more thermodynamics

3.1 strategy

in this chapter, we investigate phase diagrams of p + 1d sym theories on tori for 0 < p < 7; we also study the phase
diagram for a system of intersecting d1 and d5 branes. unlike the p = 0 case, we will deal with nite size eects
resulting from the torus on which the thermodynamics lives. in the d1d5 system, the role of angular momentum in
criticality will be one of the new ingredients.

the basic idea is a systematic analysis of various black supergravity vacua; the underlying strategy goes as follows:

a 10d or lower-dimensional near-extremal supergravity solution must satisfy the following restrictions:

 the dilaton at the horizon must be small. otherwise, in a iia theory, we need to lift to an 11d m-theory; in
a iib theory, we need to go to the s-dual geometry. this amounts to a change of description  a reshuing of
the dominant degrees of freedom  without any change in the equation of state.

 the curvature at the horizon must be smaller than the string scale. otherwise, the dynamics of massive string
modes becomes relevant. by the horowitz-polchinski correspondence principle [40], as in equation (1.15), a
string theory description emerges  an excited string, or a perturbative sym gas reecting weakly coupled
d-brane dynamics. this is generally associated with a change of the equation of state; in the thermodynamic
limit, we may expect critical behavior associated with a phase transition. this criterion can easily be estimated
for various cases when one realizes that the curvature scale is set by the horizon area divided by cycle sizes
measured at the horizon; i.e. the localized horizon area should be greater than order one in string units.1

 cycles of tori on which the geometry may be wrapped, as measured at the horizon, must be greater than the
string scale [41]. otherwise, light winding modes become relevant and the t-dual vacuum describes the proper
physics [42]. we expect no critical behavior in the thermodynamic limit, since the duality is merely a change
of description.

 the horizon size of the geometry must be smaller than the torus cycles as measured at the horizon [43, 44].
otherwise, the vacuum smeared on the cycles is entropically favored. we expect this to be associated with
a phase transition, one due to nite size eects, and it is associated generally with a change of the equation
of state. however, it is also possible that there is no such entropically favored transition by virtue of the
symmetry structure of a particular smeared geometry, so we expect no change of phase. intuitively, a system
would only localize itself in a more symmetrical solution to minimize free energy. we saw a manifestation of
this transition mechanism already in the d0 phase diagram, where the black wave w11 smeared along the
longitudinal direction localized into a boosted black hole (see figure 2.1).
in addition to this longitudinal
localization transition, this phenomena is now to appear in the context of localization along the transverse
compactied dimensions.

on the other hand, given an 11d supergravity vacuum, a somewhat dierent set of restrictions applies:

1in general, the horizon will be localized in some dimensions and delocalized (stretched) in others. the area of the localized part of

the horizon means the area along the dimensions in which the horizon is localized.

19

20

chapter 3. more thermodynamics

 the curvature near the horizon must be smaller than the planck scale. by the criterion outlined above, we
see that, for unsmeared geometries, this is simply the statement that s > 1; i.e. quantum gravity eects are
relevant for low entropies. for large enough longitudinal momentum n , this region of the phase diagram is
well away from the region of interest. this is one of the reasons for taking throughout this thesis n  1.

 the size of cycles of the torus as measured at the horizon must be greater than the planck scale. otherwise, we
need to go to the iia solution descending from dimensional reduction on a small cycle. we expect no change
of equation of state or critical behavior.

 the size of the m-theory cycles, including the light-cone longitudinal box, as measured at the horizon, must
be bigger than the horizon size. otherwise, the geometry gets smeared along the small cycles. this is expected
to be a phase transition due to nite size physics.

applying these criteria, we then select the near extremal geometry dual to a phase in sym theory on the torus,
and navigate the phase diagram via duality transformations suggested by the various restrictions. we will then be
charting the phase diagram of sym quantum eld theories or little string theories. alternatively, we are tracing
through the phases visited by a dlcq m theory black hole, the latter being a phase that arises on all our diagrams
for low entropies; the schwarzchild black hole being a generic state in m theory, we may propose that we are mapping
the thermodynamic phase diagram of dlcq m theory.

we will avoid presenting the calculations that lead to the construction of the upcoming phase diagrams. the
details can be found in [2, 3]. the basic idea was illustrated in the previous chapter. further background material
needed to decode the physics of the phase diagrams can be found in appendix b. the details of the scaling of the
various transition curves and the equations of state of the bulk phases for all our phase diagrams are tabulated in
appendix c. note also that the structure of all the diagrams can be checked by minimizing the gibbs energies
between the various phases.

3.2 phase diagrams of super yang-mills on tori

the phase diagrams for dp branes on tori have a number of common features. we focus on these aspects rst; the
reader is referred to, for example, figure 3.1 throughout the rst part of this discussion. the vertical axis of the
diagrams will be entropy; for the horizontal axis we take the size v of cycles on the torus t p, in eleven dimensional
planck units, as measured in the light-cone m-theory phase appearing in the lower right corner (the phase of boosted
11d black holes). n is the charge carried by the system: brane number in the high entropy regimes and longitudinal
momentum in the low-energy, light-cone m-theory phase. the sym torus radii  and the eective sym coupling
for large n can be written in terms of the parameters of the boosted black hole phase

(t  e/s is the temperature). the unshaded areas are described by various supergravity solutions, while the shaded
regions do not have dual geometrical descriptions. throughout the various phases, the corresponding gravitational
couplings vanish in the maldacena limit (except for p = 6, where the limit keeps the planck scale of the high-entropy
phase held xed), implying the decoupling of gravity for the dual dynamics. solid lines on the diagrams denote
thermodynamic transitions separating distinct phases, while dotted lines represent symmetry transformations which
change the appropriate low-energy description. we do not expect sharp phase transitions along these dotted curves
since the scaling of the equations of state is unchanged across them. this, does not in principle exclude the possibility
of smoother (i.e. higher order) transitions.

the structure of the phase diagram for v > 1 is identical in all the cases we encounter. at high entropies and
large m theory torus, we have a perturbative p+1d sym gas phase. its yang-mills coupling gy increases toward the
left. the eective dimensionless coupling is of order one on the double lines bounding this phase, which are horowitz-
polchinski correspondence curves. as the entropy decreases at large v , there is a d0 brane phase arising at s  n 2
on the right and middle of the diagrams. from the perturbative sym side, this is where the thermal wavelength
becomes of order the size of the box dual to v , tc  1; from the d0 phase side, it is a horowitz-polchinski
correspondence curve. this transition may be associated with rich microscopic physics. from the thermodynamic

3.2. phase diagrams of super yang-mills on tori

perspective, as the transition is crossed, dynamics is transferred from local excitations in p + 1d sym to that of its
zero modes; and dp brane charge of the perturbative sym is traded for longitudinal momentum charge of light-cone
m-theory. this process is one of several paths on the phase diagram relating the maldacena and matrix conjectures.
the description of the d0 phase within strongly coupled sym theory would be highly interesting. we see that
this phase localizes into a light-cone 11d black hole phase for entropies s < n . this region of the phase diagram
is then a reproduction of figure 2.2; i.e. for v      0, we connect to the 0 + 1d sym physics. the line
s  n separates the 11d phases that are localized on the m-theory circle (whose coordinate size is r11) from those
that are delocalized, uniformly across the diagram [45, 32, 31, 46]. the 11d black hole phase at small entropy
becomes smeared across the t p when the horizon size becomes smaller than the torus scale v ; we denote generally
such smeared phases by an overline (in this case 11d). this (de)localization transition of the horizon on the compact
space extends above the s  n transition, separating the black dp brane phase from the black d0 brane phase.
initially, the d0 brane phase becomes smeared to d0; as the entropy increases, the eective geometry of the latter
patch becomes substringy at the horizon, and one should t-dualize into the black dp brane patch. both the d0 and
dp patches have the same equation of state, since they are related by a symmetry transformation of the theory; they
are dierent pieces of the same phase. the localization transition line runs into the correspondence curve separating
the sym gas phase from the geometrical phases at s  n 2. thus as we move to the left (decreasing v , i.e. increasing
bare sym coupling) at high entropy s > n 2, the sym gas phase reaches a correspondence point; on the other side
of the transition is the phase of black dp-branes.

a further common feature of the diagrams is a self-duality point at

v  1 and s  n

8p
7p ,

(3.2)

where a number of u-duality curves meet. that the various patches do not overlap is a self-consistency check on
the logical structure of the picture. basically, there is always only one set of degrees of freedom that dictate the
low energy dynamics in a given window of the thermodynamic parameter space.the duality transformation that
patch the various string theories together now mold various thermodynamical vacua into one phase diagram for the
sym theory. we also note the following connections to previous work. for high entropies, localization eects are
circumvented and the phases are the ones studied in [13]; the triple point on the upper right corner was the one
studied in [41].

on the diagram, the behavior of the eective sym coupling depends on the equation of state governing a given

region under consideration. we nd the equipotentials of the eective coupling in the dp phase

g2

e (cid:0)n 6psp3v 3p(cid:1) 5p

9p .

(3.3)

for p < 4 and in the dp phase domain, the eective coupling increases diagonally on the diagrams as we move
toward lower entropies and smaller volumes v p. using the equation of state of the localized d0 phase, we obtain the
equipotentials in the d0 phase for all diagrams

g2

e (cid:18) n 2

s (cid:19)5/3

,

(3.4)

i.e. equation (2.1). the coupling increases from one at s  n 2 as we lower the entropy toward the 11d black
hole phase. from sym physics, both correspondence curves are where the eective coupling is of order one; the
localization eect at s  n 2 changes this eective coupling appropriately.
p = 1, 2, 3 diagrams will be displayed and discussed next. the p = 4, 5, 6 cases will be tackled in the next section.

in contrast, the structure of the phase diagrams for v < 1 depends very much on the specic case at hand. the

figure 3.1 depicts the thermodynamic phase diagram of sym theory on the circle. in total, we have six dierent
thermodynamic phases. the salient feature of this diagram is the matrix string phase, characterized by zn order,
appearing in the ir of the sym on the left and at strong coupling. this phase is an interesting platform to explore
some of the phase transitions through a statistical mechanical setting. note that the dynamics is such that the
matrix string will emerge from the adjacent black geometrical phases as we move toward the left of the diagram;
this path is however not reversible as discussed earlier. the physics of this phenomena will be explored in chapter 4
in detail.

chapter 3. more thermodynamics

figures (3.2) and (3.3) depict the phase diagrams for sym theory on t 2 and t 3; v here is again the radius of
the cycles (which are chosen to be equal) measured in planck units. in the strong coupling region of sym on t 2,
the sym dynamics approaches the infrared xed point governing the dynamics of m2 branes  the conformal eld
theory dual to m-theory on ads4  s7 (in poincare coordinates). the proper size of the t 2 shrinks toward the
origin; at high entropy, the black m2 geometry accurately describes the low-energy physics, while at low entropy the
near-horizon geometry is best described in terms of the iib theory dual to m-theory on t 2 [47]. in the t 3 case, the
diagram reects the self-duality of the d3 branes and m-theory on t 3 as reection symmetry about v  1. the t
y n xed with n  , focusses in on the neighborhood of the vertical line at ln v / ln n   1
hooft scaling limit, g2
3 .
finally, we conclude by restating a previous observation. starting with a thermodynamic phase in light-cone m-
theory, say for example the lower right corner phase of the 11d boosted black hole, using geometrical considerations,
the duality symmetries of m-theory, and the horowitz-polchinski correspondence with the perturbative sym phase,
we would be led to conclude that light-cone m-theory thermodynamics is encoded in the thermodynamics of sym
qft. we saw that the dlcq limit is dual to the maldacena energy regime; this mapping is depicted on the phase
diagrams by the two dotted curves on the right half of the gures converging to the self-duality point. maldacenas
conjecture asserts that underlying all these phases is super yang-mills theory in various regimes of its parameter
space. having not known the matrix conjecture, we would then have been led to it from maldacenas proposal.
the matrix conjecture is a special realization of the more general statement of maldacena. correspondingly, our
ability to discover the low-energy theories that yield matrix theory on some background depends on our ability to
understand duality structures with less supersymmetry in sucient detail to construct the phase diagram analogous
to gures 3.1-3.3.

3.3 phase diagrams of five brane theories

in this section, we extend our analysis to p + 1d sym theories for p = 4, 5, where the relevant theories involve the
dynamics of ve-branes [48, 28, 30, 49]; and p = 6, where the decoupling issue is problematic [30, 49, 50, 51, 52].
in the process of generating the phase diagrams, we will rediscover the known prescriptions for generating matrix
theory compactications on t 4, t 5, and t 4/z2; we will also comment on the diculties encountered for p = 6.

in addition, we will analyze the phase diagram of the d1d5 system, which arises in diverse contexts:

 it has played a central role in our understanding of black hole thermodynamics [4];
 it is a prime example of maldacenas conjecture, due to the rich algebraic structure of 1+1d superconformal

theories which are proposed duals to string theory on ads3  s3  m4 [9, 53, 54, 55];

 it describes the little string theory of vebranes

momentum charges.

[28, 26], where the little strings carry both winding and

 it is related to the dlcq description of vebrane dynamics [56, 57, 58, 59].

the analysis will clarify the relation of the d-brane description of the system to one in terms of ns vebranes and
fundamental strings [55], as low-energy descriptions of dierent regions of the phase diagram (for earlier work, see
[60]).

3.3.1 phase diagrams for t 4, t 5, and t 6

figure 3.4 is the phase diagram of t 4 compactication. there are six dierent phases, several of which  the 11d and
11d black hole, black d0 and dp brane, and sym gas phases  were discussed above. in a slight shift of emphasis,
we have relabeled the black d4 brane phase as the black m 5 brane phase, since its description in terms of the latter
object extends to the region v < 1 (in fact, even for a patch of v > 1 the d4 brane becomes strongly coupled and
must be lifted to m-theory). the appropriate dual non-gravitational description involves the six-dimensional (2, 0)
theory on t 4  s1, where the last factor is the m-theory circle; the scale of kaluza-klein excitations given by the
size of this circle (times the number of branes) sets the transition point between the (2, 0) and sym descriptions.
this m 5 phase consists of six patches that we cycle through via duality transformations required to maintain a valid
low-energy description. the energy per entropy increases toward the left and toward higher entropies; this is to be
contrasted with the cases analyzed above where the ir limit appears toward the left of the diagrams. this behavior

3.3. phase diagrams of five brane theories

25

is a consequence of the reversal of the direction of rg ow between p < 3 and p > 3. as we continue to the left
and/or down on the gure at small volume v < 1, the t 4 is small while the m-theory circle remains large; eventually
one reduces to string theory along the cycles of the t 4, and the m5-brane dualizes into a string. somewhat further in
this direction, we encounter a horowitz-polchinski correspondence curve, and a transition to a phase consisting of a
matrix string [34, 35, 61] with eective string tension set by the adjacent geometries. using maldacenas conjecture,
we thus validate earlier suggestions to describe matrix strings using the (2, 0) theory [48, 28, 30]. this matrix string
phase has a correspondence curve also for low entropies, now with respect to a phase of smeared light-cone m theory
black holes (or equivalently boosted iib holes).

figure 3.4 is trivially modied to give the phase diagram of the (2, 0) theory on t 4/z2  s1. the additional
structure does not aect the critical behavior of the diagram. the change appears in the chain of dualities we
perform on the dotted lines of the diagram. appendix d contains the details. the orbifold quotient metamorphoses
into world-sheet parity, and the fundamental string patch (labeled f 1) becomes that of the heterotic string. the
emerging matrix string phase at the correspondence point is then that of a heterotic theory. we thus conrm the
suggestion [62, 63] to describe heterotic matrix strings via the (2, 0) theory on t 4/z2  s1. one can also propose
to extend the dual theory of an intermediate state obtained in the chain of dualities between the m 5 and the f 1
patches into the matrix string regime; we then have heterotic matrix strings encoded in the o(n ) theory of type i
d strings, as suggested in [64, 65, 66]. similar statements can be made about matrix theory orbifolds/orientifolds in
other dimensions.

the thermodynamic phase diagram of vebranes (sometimes called the theory of little strings [25, 28, 26]) on t 5
is shown in figure 3.5. we have a total of seven distinct phases. we again shift the notation somewhat, relabeling

the black d5 phase as a black gm 5 phase, since the latter extends the validity of the description to v < 1 2. the

equation of state of this high-entropy regime is

characteristic of a string in its hagedorn phase. we have a patch of black ns5 branes in the middle of the diagram.
they appear near the v  1 line, at which point a t duality transformation exchanges ve branes in iia and iib
theories. the iib n s5 patch connects to a d5 brane patch via s-duality. the iia n s5 patch lifts to a patch of
m 5 branes on t 5  s1 at strong coupling on the left. the extra circle is the m-circle transverse to the wrapped
m 5-branes; the horizon undergoes a localization transition on this circle at lower entropy and/or smaller v to a
phase whose equation of state is that of a 5+1d gas. it is interesting that the hagedorn transition is seen here as
a localization/delocalization transition in the black geometry. yet further in this direction, the system localizes at

along both s1 factors, and carrying momentum along the last s1. this cm phase on the lower left is u-dual to the
the d6 phase diagram has two important features (see figure 3.6). first of all, the maldacena limit keeps
xed the planck scale lpl 
v 2 of the high-entropy black taub-nut geometry3 [13]. thus, gravity does not
decouple, and the limit does not lead to a non-gravitational dual system that would serve as the denition of m-
theory in such a spacetime. a symptom of this lack of decoupling of gravity is the negative specic heat s  e3/2
of the high-entropy equation of state. this property is related to the breakdown of the usual uv-ir correspondence
of maldacena duality [67, 68]. the energy-radius relation of [68] determined by an analysis of the scalar wave
equation in the relevant supergravity background, is in fact the relation between the horizon radius and the hawking
temperature of the associated black geometry; thus, for p = 6 decreasing energy of the hawking quanta is correlated
to increasing radius of the horizon, as a consequence of the negative specic heat. this is to be contrasted with
the situation for p < 5, where the positive specic heat means increasing horizon radius correlates to increasing
temperature; and p = 5, where the hawking temperature is independent of the horizon radius in the high-entropy
regime. now, temperature in any dual description must be the same as in the supergravity description. for p < 5,
the dual is a eld theory; high temperature means uv physics dominates the typical interactions, leading to the
uv-ir correspondence. for p = 5, the dual is a little string theory; the temperature is unrelated to the horizon

2the tilde is meant to distinguish this eleven-dimensional phase (where the m-circle is transverse to the ve-branes) from the eleven

dimensional light-cone phase on the lower right, whose m-circle has a dierent origin.

3in the maldacena limit, the near horizon geometry is that of an ale space with an 1 singularity.

radius (and thus the total energy) on the gravity side, and unrelated to short-distance physics in the dual little
string theory (since high-energy collisions of strings do not probe short distances). hence the uv-ir correspondence
already breaks down at this point. for p = 6, there is nothing to say  large radius (large total energy) corresponds
to low temperature of probes (hawking quanta); and any dual description could not have high energy/temperature
related to short distance physics, since it is a theory that contains gravity (so high energy makes big black holes).
a second key feature is the duality symmetry (c.f. [69]) v  v 1 of the diagram relating the v < 1 structure to
that discussed above for v > 1. note that this duality symmetry inverts the t 6 volume as measured in planck units
rather than string units. the duality interchanges momentum modes with vebrane wrapping modes, while leaving
membrane wrapping modes xed; in other words, the dual space is that seen by the m 5 brane.

3.3.2 the d1d5 system
as a further example of our methods, we have examined the d1d5 system on t 4  s1, which as we mentioned
above can be considered as the little string theory of q5 vebranes, with q1 units of string winding along the s1.
figure 3.7 shows the thermodynamic phase diagram. in the maldacena limit4, this theory is a representation of the
algebra of n = (4, 4) superconformal transformations in 1+1d [9, 71, 72, 53, 54, 55]. we have dened k  q1q5
and q  q1/q5. we keep k xed, but q may be viewed as a variable ranging between 1 < q < k, thus moving some
of the dotted curves of duality transformation, but not altering phase transition curves. for q  1, we can exchange
the roles of q1 and q5 via duality transformations across the diagram; the structure is unchanged. the other limit,
q = k, is the q5 = 1 bound. the vertical axis on the diagram is again the entropy, while the horizontal axis is the
six-dimensional string coupling g6  gs/v of the d1d5 patch, where v = v4/2 is the volume of the t 4 in string
units (equivalently g2
is the volume of the t 4 in appropriate string units of the ns5fb phase). the phase diagram
has a symmetry g6  1/g6 (inversion of the torus in the ns5fb phase); this is the t-duality symmetry of the little
string theory. from the perspective of the d1d5 patch, we can consider the entire phase diagram as that of the
1+1d conformal theory that arises in the ir of this gauge theory, which is conjectured to be dual to the near-horizon
geometry ads3  s3  t 4 of the d1d5 system. in this patch, the d strings are wrapped on a cycle of size r5.
this parameter is absent from the scaling relations of all curves because of conformal symmetry. analogous to the
singly-charged brane systems we have been discussing, at high entropies there is a 1+1d gas phase at small g6 (large
eective v4), which passes across a correspondence curve to the black brane phase as the coupling increases. being
determined by conformal symmetry and quantization of the central charge, the equation of state does not change
across this phase transition. starting in the 1+1d gas phase and decreasing the entropy, s  k corresponds to the
point where the thermal wavelength in the 1+1d conformal theory becomes of order the size of the box r5. this is
again a horowitz-polchinski correspondence curve from the side of lower entropies, analogous to the sym theories
at s  n 2 5. there is a localization transition on the r5 cycle cutting obliquely across the diagram. the localized
phase can be interpreted as that of m 5 branes with a large boost, thus connecting with the proposal of [56] for
a matrix theory of this system. the lower boundary of this phase occurs at entropies of order s  k, where a

bps matrix string phase emerges and the diagram is truncated at nite entropy. we nd agreement with vafas
argument [73] that the bps spectrum in the r sector of the d1d5 system is that of fundamental iib strings carrying
winding and momentum (sometimes called dabholkar-harvey states [74]). similarly, chasing through the sequence
of dualities for the d1d5 system on k3  s1, one nds the bps spectrum consists of dabholkar-harvey states of
the heterotic string.
for simplicity, we have restricted the set of parameters we have considered in the phase diagram to the entropy
and the coupling g6. it is straightforward to see what will happen as other moduli of the near-horizon geometry
are varied. consider for instance decreasing one of the t 4 radii keeping the total volume xed. at some point,
the appropriate low energy description will require t-duality on this circle, shifting from d1-branes dissolved into
d5-branes, to d2-branes ending on d4-branes. one can then chase this duality around the diagram: the n s5f b
phase becomes m 2-branes ending on m 5-branes; the n s5w a, d0d4, and d0d4 phases become d1-branes ending
on d3-branes; and the m 5w and m 5w phases become those of fundamental strings ending on d3 branes. the
near-extremal f 1w b phase is unaected. one can also imagine replacing the t 4 by k3. moving around the k3

4 this regime corresponds to taking   0, with r, g6, and v held xed. this sends the little string tension to innity and drives the
equation of state of the smeared phase to light-cone scaling. more general limits of decoupling can be considered and yield somewhat
richer structures for the phase diagram [70].

5there is similarly a hidden phases of zero specic heat between the gas phase and the lower, localized phase, as can be seen by the

discontinuity in temperatures that occurs between s > k and s < k.

3.3. phase diagrams of five brane theories

27

moduli space, when a two-cycle becomes small, a d3-brane wrapping the vanishing cycle becomes light; one should
consider making a duality transformation that turns q1 or q5 into the wrapping number on this cycle.

thus the d1d5 system appears to have a remarkably varied life. on the one hand, it can describe low-energy
supergravity on a 6d space, namely ads3s3; the common coordinate of the branes is the angle coordinate on ads3.
this space parametrizes physics of the coulomb branch of the gauge theory. on the other hand, the same system
describes the decoupled dynamics of the ve-brane, another 6d system 6  except that the spatial coordinates are
now t 4  s1, with the t 4 apparently related to the physics of the higgs branch of the gauge theory, and the s1 the
dimension common to the branes. in the maldacena limit, the theory is a representation of the 1+1d superconformal
group.

figure 3.4: phase diagram of the six-dimensional (2, 0) theory on t 4
 s1. v = r/lpl is the size of a cycle on the t 4 of
light-cone m theory. the dashed line is the extension of the axis v = 1, and is merely included to help guide the eye. the
label dictionary is as follows: d0: black d0 geometry; w 11: black 11d wave geometry; 11dbh: 11d light-cone black hole;
d0: black smeared d0 geometry; w 11: black smeared 11d wave geometry; 11dbh: 11d smeared light-cone black hole; d4:
black d4 geometry; m 5: black m5 geometry; f 1: black smeared fundamental string geometry; w b: black smeared iib wave
geometry; 10dbh: iib boosted black hole. the phase diagram can also be considered that of the (2, 0) theory on t 4/z2  s1
by reinterpreting the f 1, w b, 10d phases, and the matrix string phase as those of a heterotic theory. .

black hole formation
from super yang-mills

4.1 summary

a characteristic of the sym phase diagrams we encountered in the previous chapters was the emergence, at strong
yang-mills coupling and low entropies, of a light-cone black hole phase. we also encountered in the analysis for
the phase diagram for the d1 system a phase describing a highly excited matrix string. both matrix black hole and
matrix string have explicit realizations as excitations in the sym elds as discussed in sections 2.2 and 2.3. it would
then be interesting to study the microscopic dynamics of the formation of the light-cone black hole phase as the
string coupling of the matrix string is tuned up. previous analysis [75] of the collapse of a gravitationally interacting
string into a black hole has yielded the conclusion that such a collapse accurs at weak string coupling provided that
the system is compactied to low enough dimensions. this is because gravitational forces fall coulombically as a
power of the distance between the interacting objects and this power is smaller when the system is embedded in
lower dimensions. hence, the gravitational forces become stronger when we compactify to lower dimensions. the
purpose of this chapter is to arrange a setting in the sym theory where a matrix string-matrix black hole transition
occurs readily; we then try to analyze the statistical mechanics of the formation of the black hole from sym physics.
we would like 1 + 1d sym dynamics and a space-time compactied to low enough dimensions. we can achieve
this dynamical setting by considering p + 1d sym theory compactied on a skewed torus t p; i.e. p  1 radii of
this torus will be accorded a dierent size from the pth radius. we consider light-cone m theory compactied on
this torus, and we descend from it along the pth torus cycle to light-cone iia theory; this cycle then gives us the
string coupling gstr . the longitudinal boost direction is accorded radius size r+. the remaining p  1 cycles fo the
torus are tuned to the string scale. our sym theory then describes dlcq iia theory parametrized by gstr , lstr ,
n and r+. we pick an object in this iia theory, a black hole or a highly excited string, and trace its history on a
thermodynamic phase diagram.

figure 4.1 is the phase diagram for the system of interest. we choose to work on a two dimensional cross section
in the entropy-string coupling s-gs plane, with xed longitundinal momentum n  1. in principle, one is to take
the thermodynamic limit n   with n/s xed, to see criticality; transition between phases at nite but large
n are smooth crossovers. it is expected that, in the innite n limit, the physics tends to the appropriate critical
behavior. the gure is a correct representation of physics for compactications on t 4 or t 5, i.e. for p = 4, 5; these
are the scenarios where the transverse non-compact space is small enough in dimensions for a black to form, while
the torus is of low enough in dimensions for gravity to decouple from the sym theory. the limit of validity of the
sym description for the dlcq string theory is determined by the upper right curve. above this line, the physics is
not accurately described by super yang-mills theory; rather, one must pass to the six-dimensional little string theory
as was done in the previous chapter. we will see that the dynamics of interest to us occurs outside this region. we
identify several phases in this setting; a smeared black hole phase (10d bh), a matrix string phase, a phase of p + 1
dimensional strongly interacting sym (i.e. the phase described by black dp branes), and perhaps a coexistence
phase of a matrix string with sym vapor. there is a triple point, a thermodynamic critical point of the dlcq
string theory where three transition manifolds coincide.

figure 4.1: the proposed thermodynamic phase diagram for the p + 1d sym on the skewed torus for p = 4, 5.
equivalently, this is the phase diagram for dlcq iia theory on t p1. on the horizontal axis is the iia string
coupling, which is the aspect ratio of the sym torus. the vertical axis is entropy.

a brief description of the physics of the diagram is as follows: in type iia dlcq string theory on t p1, with
p = 4, 5, there exists a (longitudinally wrapped) dp-brane phase; it is unstable at s  n to the formation of a
black hole because of longitudinal localization eects. along another critical curve (the diagonal line above s  n ),
the dp brane freezes its strongly coupled excitations onto a single direction of the torus, making a transition to a
perturbative string through the horowitz-polchinski correspondence principle. in this regime, the thermodynamics
is that of a near-extremal fundamental (iib) string supergravity solution, with curvature at the horizon becoming
of order the string scale. the correspondence mechanism also applies on the other side of the s  n transition;
in this case, a matrix black hole makes a transition to a matrix string when it acquires string scale curvature at
the horizon. a coexistence phase, where both matrix string and sym gas excitations contribute strongly to the
thermodynamics, may exist in the region indicated on the diagram; this depends on the extent to which the object
persists long enough to treat it using the methods of equilibrium thermodynamics.

our second set of results concerns the dynamics that leads to the correspondence transitions, and is summarized
by figure 4.2. the plot depicts the mutual gravitational interaction energy between a pair of points on a typical
(thermally excited) macroscopic matrix string, as a function of the world-sheet distance x along the string separating
the two points. this potential governs the dynamics of the matrix string near a black hole or black brane transition,
as it is approached from the weak string coupling side. a bump in the potential occurs at the thermal wavelength
n/s for p = 4, 5 (ve or four noncompact spatial directions); in these dimensions, the correspondence transition to
a black hole is indeed caused by the strings self-interaction, as discussed in [75]. for smaller p (more noncompact
spatial directions), there is no bump; similarly, in [75] the self-interactions could not cause a spontaneous collapse
to a black object. we will see that the height of the bump is proportional to the gravitational coupling, such that it
connes excitations of the string on the strong-coupling side of the correspondence transition.

this result supports the suggestion [33] to describe the black hole phase as clustered matrix sym excitations
of size n/s. these correlated clusters were invoked in order that the object with n > s can be localized in the
longitudinal direction. such a localization necessarily involves the longitudinal momentum physics of matrix theory.
we nd that a plausible argument for the dynamics with this potential gives the two correspondence curves as the
boundaries of validity of the matrix string phase: for n < s, one nds the transition to the dp brane phase shown
in figure (4.1); while for n > s, one nds the transition to the matrix black hole phase. accounting for the latter
transition requires taking into consideration longitudinal momentum transfer eects as in [33]; we justify this by a
string theory amplitude calculation involving winding number exchange in a dual picture given in appendix f. we
thus conclude that we have identied the characteristics of the microscopic mechanism of black hole formation from

4.2.2 the phase diagram

given that we are working with matrix theory on t 4 and t 5, the rst question that must be addressed concerns
the validity of the description, given that sym 4+1d and 5+1d are non-renormalizable. new degrees of freedom

36

chapter 4. black hole formation from super yang-mills

are required to make sense of the sym dynamics as we probe it in the uv, i.e. as we navigate outward in the
corresponding supergravity solution. these new degrees of freedom for sym 4+1d and 5+1d are associated with the
onset of strong coupling dynamics; the validity of the theories at dierent energy scales is then determined by looking
at the size of the dilaton vev at dierent locations in the supergravity solution. for nite temperatures, physics at
the thermal wavelength of the sym is identied with physics at the horizon of the near extremal solution (1.9). the
nite temperature vacuum of the 4 + 1d and 5 + 1d sym is a valid thermodynamic description of the dlcq iia
theory when

this is a purely geometric statement, in terms of the horizon area and string coupling. for entropies satisfying this
bound, the sym statistical mechanics obeys the equation of state

from our discussion in the earlier chapters, we know that this phase will localize into a black hole for s < n . this
is a 11d schwarzchild hole smeared over t p; it appears as a black hole living in dlcq iia theory smeared on t p1.
its equation of state is

.

(4.8)

the schwarzschild black hole geometry will become stringy when its curvature near the horizon becomes of the
order of the string scale; the emerging state is a matrix string in the matrix conjecture language, i.e. a 1 + 1d
dynamics with zn holonomy on p. minimizing the gibbs energy between the matrix string

and the matrix black hole phases leads to the horowitz-polchinski correspondence curve [40, 75]

osc

, where nosc is the string oscillator level, there

we next deal with nite size eects in the dp brane phase which are due to the other radii i. because the
torus is skewed, the thermal wavelength probes a p  1 dimensional torus. we expect a localization transition to a
phase consisting of the geometry of d1 branes. equating the energies of (4.7) for p = 1 and for general p, we get the
transition point

.

(4.11)

ng1

we nd however that, near this transition point, the d1 vacuum is strongly coupled at the horizon; the s-dual
geometry is that of black fundamental strings in iib theory. no change of equation of state occurs through this
duality transformation. the curvature at the horizon of the black iib string solution is found to become of order the
string scale at precisely (4.11), beyond which a matrix string description emerges. our analysis leading to (4.11) is
then valid. we can further check the correctness of this conclusion by matching the equation of state (4.7) with that
of the matrix string (4.9), the latter being the dominant phase on the other side of this correspondence curve. the
result is again (4.11). we conclude that the dp brane phase makes a transition to a matrix string at (4.11).

finally, we note that we assumed above that there exists a well dened matrix string description for n < s. in
this regime, the thermal wavelength on the matrix string is smaller than the uv cuto imposed by the discretized
nature of the matrices. our procedure may be equivalent to an analytical continuation of the matrix string phase
into a regime where the description may not be fully justied; this is in the same spirit as the extension of the van
der waals equation of state into the gas-liquid coexistence region, which one uses to identify the emergence of the
liquid phase[76]. furthermore, the regime n < s is similar to the hagedorn regime [77, 78], in that the temperature
remains constant as the system absorbs heat. we speculate that the n < s regime of the matrix string near the
triple point is characterized by a coexistent phase of a string with sym vapor.

as a unifying probe for all the transitions, we observe that the mass per unit charge q dened by

(4.13)

from the point of view of the dlcq string theory characterized by the parameters gs, lstr and n , this scaling
on the transition curves is a non-trivial signature of a unifying framework underlying the physics of criticality of the
theory. note also that the g2
s n combination is not the t hooft coupling of the sym description; recall that gs is a
modulus of the torus compactication. from the point of view of eld theory, the various transitions that we have
identied are predictions about the thermodynamics of 4+1d, 5+1d sym on the torus well into non-perturbative
eld theory regimes.

4.3 the interacting matrix string

in this section, we study the dynamics near the triple point in greater detail from the side of the matrix string. in
section 2.2, it was argued that the matrix black hole phase, as a conguration of the sym elds, can be thought
of as a gas of s distinguishable clusters of d0 branes, each cluster consisting of n/s partons. the system is self-
interacting through the v4/r7 interaction, or its smeared form on the torus. this phase of clustered d0 branes
may be an eective description, i.e. thermodynamically strongly correlated regions of a metastable state; or more
optimistically, it might be a microscopic description associated with formation of bound states like in bcs theory.
we will try here to investigate the matrix string dynamics so as to reveal the signature of the clusters as we approach
the correspondence curve. the aim is to identify a possible dynamical mechanism for black hole formation, and
determine the correspondence curve from such a microscopic consideration.

in section 4.3.1, we derive the potential between two points on the matrix string; in view of the matrix conjecture,
we can do this by expanding the dirac-born-infeld (dbi) action of a d-string in the background of a d-string. we
then evaluate the expectation value of this potential in the free string ensemble at xed temperature. in sections 4.3.2
and 4.3.3, we analyze the characteristic features of the potential, particularly noting the bump for p = 4, 5 that we
alluded to in the introduction. in section 4.3.4, we comment on the dynamics implied by the potential, particularly
in regard to the phase diagram derived earlier.

4.3.1 the potential

in this section, we derive the potential between two points on the matrix string by expanding the dbi action for
a d-string probe in the background geometry of a d-string. we then check the validity of the dbi expansion, and
evaluate the expectation value of the potential in the thermal ensemble of highly excited matrix strings. the details
of the nite temperature eld theory calculations are collected in appendix e.

a iia string in matrix string theory is constructed in a sector of eld congurations described by diagonal
matrices, with a holonomy in zn ; a nonlocal gauge transformation converts this into t hooft-like twisted boundary
conditions on the transverse excitations of the eigenvalues of the matrices, as described in detail in [35, 61, 79, 34].
the conclusion is that the eigenvalues are sewn together into a long string, and a iia string emerges as an object
looking much like a coil or slinky wrapped on p. the self-interactions of this string are described by integrating
out o-diagonal modes between the well-separated strands. alternatively, making use of the matrix conjecture,
this eective action can be obtained from supergavity, by expanding the born-infeld action of a d-string in the
background of a d-string 1. we will follow this prescription to calculate the gravitational self-interaction potential
between two points on a highly excited matrix string.

1note that, for d-string strands closer to each other than the plank scale, the w bosons cannot be integrated out in the problem; the
physics is described by the full non-abelian degrees of freedom. we are assuming here that this uv physics does not eect the analysis
done at a larger length scale.

solution to a d0 brane, lifted to 11 dimensions, compactied on a lightlike direction, and t-dualized the solution to
the one above. the only change is in replacing 1 + (r0/r)7p  (r0/r)7p. by gauss law,

a glance at figure 4.1 reveals that we are well within the region of interest.

the potential in this expression is the interaction energy between a d-string probe and a d-string source. using
the residual galilean symmetry in the dlcq, and assuming string thermal wavelengths > p (the slinky regime),
we deduce that the potential between two points on the matrix strings denoted by the labels 1 and 2 is

ideally, one should self-consistently determine the shape distribution of the string in the presence of this self-
interaction; however, this is rather too complicated to actually carry out. to rst order in small gs, the eect of the
potential is to weigh dierent regions of the energy shell in phase space [83] by a factor derived from its expectation
value in the free string ensemble. we will discuss the dynamics in the presence of the potential in somewhat more
detail below. for now, in light of this weak-coupling approximation scheme, we would like to calculate the expectation
value of the potential in a thermodynamic ensemble consisting of a highly excited free string with xed entropy s.
from the matrix string theory point of view, this is essentially a problem in nite temperature eld theory, where
we will deal with a two dimensional bose gas (ignoring supersymmetry; the fermion contribution is similar) on a
torus with sides pn and  = 1/t ,  being the period of the euclidean time. using wick contractions, we can then
express the potential in terms of the free greens functions; we defer the details to appendix e. we get

divergences will be seen in correlators due to innite zero point energies. the conventional approach is to
introduce a normal ordering scheme giving the vacuum zero expectation value in such situations, i.e. throwing away
disconnected vacuum bubbles. in our case, the string has a classical background due to its thermal excitation. to
renormalize nite t correlators, we subtract the zero temperature limit from each propagator. this corresponds to

hf (x)i  f ( 

j ) ln zt [j]  f (

j ) ln zt =0[j] = f (

from the expression for z[j], we see that this amounts to correcting the greens functions as

k  kt  kt =0.

it is the statement that within the thermal wavelength  of the the excited string, the string is stretched, scaling as
osc x. this is intuitively expected, as regions on the string within the typical thermal wavelength will be
strongly correlated in the thermodynamic sense. this change in the scaling is crucial to what we will soon see in the

figure 4.5: the potential as a function of x for dimensions p = 3 and p = 2.

4.3.3 the bump potential

(4.47)

for p > 3, v12  0 as x  0; at larger x, it decays as xd/2. at the thermal wavelength x  1/s, both expressions
give

note that in this expression the dimension dependence in the power of s conspires to vanish. for p = 3, v12  s4
for x  0, while for p < 3, v12   for x  0; in both of these latter cases, the potential decays as xd/2 for larger
x.
the conclusion can be summarized as follows. for p = 4 and p = 5, there exists a bump in the potential of height
proportional to s4 at the thermal wavelength on the string; for p = 3, the bump smoothes to a at conguration
where the dierence between the potential at the thermal wavelength separation and at x = 0 is of order unity.
finally, for p < 3, the bump disappears altogether and the potential blows up at the origin signaling the breakdown
of the description. this potential is plotted in various cases in figure 4.2 of the introduction and figure 4.5.

the presence or absence of the bump is a result of two competing eects: first of all, the increasingly singular
short-distance behavior of the coulomb potential (4.26) with increasing dimension d; and secondly, the strong
correlation of neighboring points on the string, which makes (x1  x2) decrease as the separation along the string
decreases (inside a thermal wavelength).

we observe that:

 the bump occurs at separations of 1/s of a fraction of the whole length of the string; in the matrix theory

language, this corresponds to a bump about matrices of size n/s.

 the presence or absence of the bump as a function of the number of non-compact space dimensions correlates
with the observations of [75], given that in the dlcq, the light-like direction reduces the number of non-
compact dimensions by one. in [75], considering the gravitational self-interactions of a highly excited string,
the authors demonstrated that the string collapses into a black hole at weak string coupling (4.10) provided
that there are less than six non-compact space dimensions. correspondingly, we observe the bump in the
potential for the scenarios where we have four or ve non-compact space dimensions in light-cone iia theory.

 as described in [33], a matrix black hole can be described by sym excitations clustered within matrices of
size n/s, the location of the bump. furthermore, we will shortly reproduce, from scaling arguments regarding
the dynamics of this potential, the two correspondence lines determined from thermodynamic considerations
above.

we then conclude that we have identied the characteristic signature of black hole formation in the matrix sym.

4.3. the interacting matrix string

4.3.4 dynamical issues and black hole formation

the dynamics of this potential near a phase transition point is certainly complicated. intuitively, we expect that as
we approach a critical point, instabilities develop, an order parameter uctuates violently, perhaps related to some
measure of the zn symmetry; it is reasonable to expect the characteristic feature of the potential, the conning
bump, plays a crucial role in the dynamics of the emerging phase. let us try to extract from these results the scaling
of the correspondence curves.

first let us motivate the use of the expectation value of the potential in the free string ensemble. we indicated
earlier that this quantity is qualitatively related to the eect of the interactions, assuming they are weak enough, on
the energy shell in phase space covered by the free string. the partition function becomes, schematically

z  tr eh0+v  ehv i0tr eh0 ,

(4.49)

so that phase space is weighed by an additional factor related to the expectation value of the potential in the free
ensemble hv i0. this is also similar to the rg procedure applied to the 2d ising model, where the context and
interpretation is slightly dierent [83].

using equation (4.28), the potential energy content of the matrix string is given by

v z n p

0

d (cid:18)s4g2

s

r3
+

3n 4(cid:19) (n p) v12 ,

(4.50)

where we have integrated over one of the two intergals of the translationally invariant two-body potential, and scaled
v12 such that its maximum is of order 1, independent of any state variables; however, the shape of v12 still depends
on n and s. this expression represents the interaction energy between two points on the coiled matrix string at
xed separation . from the point of view of matrix theory physics, the strings fundamental dynamical degrees of
freedom are the windings on the coil; we expect a transition in the dynamics of the object when there is a competition
between forces on an individual winding. in the present case, the two forces are nearest neighbor elastic interaction
and the gravitational interaction. a single string winding being wrapped on p worth of world-sheet, the maximum
potential energy it feels can be read from equation (4.50)

and is due to its interaction with strands a thermal wavelength away. its thermal energy caused by nearest neighbour
interactions is read o equation (4.22)

(4.52)

(4.53)

at stronger coupling, the forces due to the gravitational interaction dominate those of the nearest neighbor stretching
and decohere neighboring strands velocities. the free string evaluation of the interaction, equation (4.28), is no longer
valid; one expects a phase transition to occur. equation (4.53) is our matching result of (4.11) between the string
and p + 1d interacting sym phase. here, we are assuming an analytical continuation of the matrix string phase to
the region n < s in the phase diagram; our suggestion that this region is associated with a coexistence phase is
consistent with this procedure.

to account for the correspondence curve for n > s, we now recall that in the discussion of clustered d0 branes
of [33], the virial treatment of the v4/r7 interaction had to be corrected by a factor in order to reproduce the black
hole equation of state; the origin of this correction was argued to be interaction processes between the clusters
involving the exchange of longitudinal momentum. under the assumption that these eects are of the same order
as zero momentum transfer processes, a correction factor of n/s was applied. using a chain of dualities, we can
quantify the eect of longitudinal momentum transfer physics by studying the scattering amplitude in iib string
theory with winding number exchange. we do this in appendix f, where we nd that, for exchanges of windings
up to order n/s, the winding exchange generates an interaction identical to that of zero longitudinal momentum
exchange; for higher winding exchanges, the interactions are much weaker. these winding modes, represent the
sections of the matrix string within the thermal wavelength, n/s worth of d-string windings. thus we modify the

44

chapter 4. black hole formation from super yang-mills

v12 potential above by the factor n/s, which accounts in the scaling analysis for the eect of longitudinal momentum
transfer physics in the matrix string self-interaction potential. applying the virial theorem between equation (4.52)
and n/s times equation (4.51) yields the matrix string-matrix black hole correspondence point at

s  g2

s

,

(4.54)

as needed.

we can now interpret our results as follows. the bump potential accounts for the matching of the string phase
onto both n < s and n > s phases, one involving partons interacting without longitudinal momentum exchange
(the matrix string-dp brane curve in figure 4.1), and the other being the matrix black hole phase of parton clusters
of size n/s > 1 interacting in addition by exchange of longitudinal momentum (the matrix string/matrix black hole
correspondence curve of figure 4.1). in the latter case, the location of the conning bump correlates with matrices
of size n/s. in the former case, the correlations are ner than the uv matrix cuto; a better understanding of this
latter issue obviously needs a more quantitative analysis of the n < s matrix string regime. this analysis further
substantiates the identication of the bump potential as the signature of black hole formation from matrix sym, as
well as justifying the new matrix string-dp brane transition microscopically.

a few words about black holes

four laws of thermodynamics with the following identications: the area of the horizon a is mapped to the entropy

d is the gravitational coupling; the temperature is given by the surface

a geometry in general relativity is accorded a mass or energy by studying probe dynamics at large distances away
from the source responsible for the curving of the space-time. this gives a measure for the energy content of the
system as seen by an observer at innity. for a metric of the form [88]

ds2 = a(r)dt2 + b(r)dr2 + r2c(r)d2

dp2 + d(r)dyi dyi ,

i running over p space coordinates, the mass per unit p dimensional volume is given by

m = 

dp2

22

d (cid:2)(d  p  2)rdp2rc + prdp2rd

 (d  p  2)rdp3(b  c)(cid:3)r ,

where dp2 is the surface area of the unit d  p  2-sphere. using equations (a.1) and (a.4), we can write an
equation of state for a black geometry. the simplest example is that of a schwarzchild black hole in d space-time
dimensions. the metric is

we will often need to consider boosted black holes. for this, we change to isotropic coordinates [2], and apply
a large boost to the corresponding geometry. the light-cone energy of a boosted black hole then becomes elc =
m 2/p11, where m is the mass of the black hole given in equation (a.6).

we say a geometry localizes on a torus parametrized by the coordinates y(p) when the following transition in the

when dealing with string theoretical geometries, care must be taken to convert the string frame metric to the
str before applying the formulae (a.1) and (a.4). this puts the supergravity

action in the canonical formr g r. the dp brane metrics given in the text are written in the string frame.

appendix b

a few comments about dualities

we briey review in this appendix the various duality transformations we make use of in the text. the reader is
referred, for example,to [42, 80, 89, 90, 91, 92] for more elaborate expositions to this subject.

b.1 t duality

t duality relates a string theory compactied on a radius of size r to another string theory compactied on the dual
radius /r. the origin of this symmetry has to do with the fact that string theories describe extended objects that
can wrap compact cycles of the background geometry. in a local eld theory, excitations carrying n integer units of
momentum along a cycle of compactication of size r appear in the transverse non-compact space as quanta with
mass n/r. as r  0, only eld excitations constant along the cycle, i.e. having n = 0, survive the dynamics. in
the opposite decompactication limit r  , an innite number of avors of particles with masses given by n/r
enter the spectrum of the compactied dynamics. generically, the emergence, as a function of a modulus in the
theory, of such an innite tower of states is the signature of a new dimension opening up. in string theory, as we
compactify on a vanishingly small circle of size r, while quanta carrying momenta along this cycle are scaled out
of the dynamics, strings winding the cycle w times get their masses w(2r)/ progressively smaller; as r  0, a
tower of winding string states comes into focus, indicating that the theory being compactied may be equivalent to
one decompactifying with a cycle of size /r. indeed, the equivalence between such t dual theories has been
established even at non-zero string coupling. it is now believed that t duality is an exact symmetry of string theories.
t duality transformations relate the various known string theories to each other. iia and iib string theories
are interchanged under t-duality on an odd number of circles. similarly, the two heterotic theories, so(32) and
e8  e8, are transformed into each other under t duality. a t duality is also involved in a relation between the iia
theory on the orbifold t 4/z2 (or on k3 more generally) and the heterotic theory on t 4.

the string coupling transforms under t duality as

while the string tension is unchanged; these imply that the gravitational coupling is invariant. as argued above, the
cycle of interest gets inverted r  /r. we will also need the transformation that the low energy supergravity
elds undergo. we quote here only the forms relevant to our discussion:

(b.2)

here a is the direction along which we apply the t duality, x and y are directions transverse to this, g is the metric,
b is the gauge eld of the eld strength h(3) = db(2) that appears in equation (1.8), and  is the dilaton. note
the mixing of the metric with the gauge eld.

as the dierent string theories are transformed into each other by the action of t duality, the degrees of freedom
xy... a dp brane streched in the x, y, . . . directions;

of the theories are shued amongst each other. let us denote by dp

47

48

appendix b. a few comments about dualities

similarly, for an ns5 brane in the iia or the iib theory, we write n s5(a/b)xy..., for the f1 string we write f 1x,
and for a wave we write wx. we denote a t duality transformation along cycles a, b, . . . by tab.... we chart some
of the avor mixings under t duality; note that the condition of nilpotency tab...  tab... = 1 complements the
transformations listed below.

ta (f 1a)

tx (wa)
tx (n s5axy...)  n s5bxy...
ta (n s5axy...)  n s5bxy...

typically, the full group structure of t dualities for a d dimensional iia or iib string theory is given by the
orthogonal group over the integers o(10d, 10d; z). this group for the heterotic theories is o(26d, 10d; z).

b.2 s duality

s duality relates a theory at weak coupling to a theory at strong coupling. this can be a symmetry within a single
theory; this is the case for type iib string theory, which is said to be self-dual. the heterotic and type i string
theories on the other hand transform into each other under s duality. the action on the string coupling and tension
is given by

gstr  1/gstr ,
  gstr ,

(b.3)

(b.4)

which implies that the gravitational coupling is invariant. the action on the low energy supergravity elds relevant
to our discussion is given by

f(3) is the eld strength coupling to the d1 or d5 branes (see equation (1.8)). charting the mapping of some of the
states as was done in the previous section, we have (note that s2 = 1 as in the case of t duality):

   , h(3)  f(3) , f(3)  h(3) . .

(b.5)

in iib theory

s (wx)

in the iib, and type i-het. cases

 d3
 n s5bxy...
 f 1x

strictly speaking, s duality is still a conjectured symmetry. compelling evidence exists in favor of it being an

exact symmetry of string theories. the full group structure is typically sl(2, z).

b.3 m duality

m duality is the relation between the strong coupling regime of iia theory and m theory which we discussed in the
introduction at some length. the map between the parameters of the two theories was given in equation (1.3). the
low energy elds are related to each other via the standard kaluza-klein dimensional reduction prescription; the
metric in eleven dimensions is

ds2

11 = e2/3ds2

10 + e4/3 (dx11 + adx)2 ,

(b.6)

where ds2
10 is the ten dimensional metric in the string frame, and a is the gauge eld of the eld strength f(2)
coupling to d0 branes (see equation (1.8)). we remind the reader the relation between gravitational couplings that
arises in this procedure

d = 22
where r is the cycle size, i.e. r11 in the case of m duality.

22

d1(2r) ,

finally, we chart the table of state mapping for this duality:

in the subsequent sections, we will tabulate the scaling of the transition curves and equations of states for the phase
diagrams studied in the text. the systematic derivation of these formulae can be found in [1, 2, 3]. note that we
use a uniform labeling scheme across the sym diagrams.

the (2, 0) theory on t4/z2  s1

inspired by the discussion regarding the phase structure of the (2, 0) on t 4  s1, we further consider the phase
structure of this theory on t 4/z2  s1. this corresponds to a corner in the moduli space of k3 s1; particularly, in
addition to considering a square t 4, we will be ignoring phase dynamics associated with the 16 4 moduli that blow
up the xed points [93]. our parameter space is again two dimensional, entropy s and the volume of the t 4. there
are only two novelties that arise, both leaving the global structure of the phase diagram unchanged, modifying only
the interpretation of the various patches of geometry.

the rst change arises from the eect of the orbifold on the duality transformations; we will obviously be driven
into the other branch of the web of dualities that converge onto m theory (c.f. [94]). we proceed from the 11d phase
of the previous discussion, upward and counter- clockwise on the phase diagram. we have m theory on a light-cone
circle times t 4/z2. we reduce on r11 to d0 branes in iia living on the t 4/z2. under this orbifold, the massless
spectrum has positive parity eigenvalue. we t dualize on t 4, getting to the patch of d4 branes in iia wrapped on
t 4/z2. we remind the reader of the transformation

t(4)(4)t 1

(4) = (4) ,

where we have used the properties of the reection operator on the spinors

i = i

,

2
i = (1)fl

,

{i, j} = 0 ,

(d.1)

(d.2)

with the t duality operation reecting the left moving spinors only. here, (1)fl is the left moving fermion operator.

we then m lift to m5 branes in fm theory on t 4/z2  s1. next, we have to apply the chain of dualities m, t(3), s.
from the m reduction we obtain fd4 branes on t 3/(1)fl. this is because the m reduction along an orbifold

direction yields the twist eigenvalues for the massless spectrum

g +;  +; b ; c(1) ; c(3) + ,

(d.3)

while the world-sheet parity operator  acts on this spectrum as

g +; +; b ; c(1),(2),(5),(6) +; c(0),(3),(4),(7),(8)  ,

(d.4)

and the action of (1)fl yields

(d.5)
the t duality on t 3 brings us to d1 branes in iib theory on s1  t 3/, which is type i theory on s1  t 3. this is
because
(d.6)

nsns + ;

rr  .

t(3)(3)(1)fl t 1

(3) = (1)fl  .

finally, the s duality culminates in the geometry of n black heterotic strings smeared on the t 3. the horowitz-
polchinski correspondence curve patches this phase onto that of the heterotic matrix string phase. we thus verify
the following previous suggestions [62, 63, 64, 95] from the perspective of maldacenas conjecture:

 heterotic matrix string theory emerges in the uv of the (2, 0) theory.

59

60

appendix d. the (2, 0) theory on t4/z2  s1

 heterotic matrix strings can be described via the o(n ) sym of type i d strings

the structure of the phase diagram has not changed, but the labeling of some of the phases has. the additional
symmetry structure of the orbifold background entered our discussion trivially; the critical behaviors are unaected.
to complete the discussion, we need to address a second change to the t 4 compactication. the localization
transitions are of a somewhat dierent nature than the ones encountered earlier. localized black geometries on
orbifold backgrounds are unstable toward collapse toward the nearest xed point; by virtue of being above extremality,
there are static forces, and by virtue of the symmetry structure of the orbifold, there is no balance of forces as in
the toroidal case. it is then most probable that the localized d0 branes sit at the orbifold points, with their black
horizons surrounding the singularity. the most natural geometry is the one corresponding to 16 black d0 geometries
distributed among the singularities, yielding a non-singular geometry outside the horizons.

furthermore, we assume that k, k  and k  are zero, i.e. because of subtraction of the zero temperature limits,
or throwing away bubble diagrams. this, it turns out, is not necessary for the potential we calculate, since all
expressions would have come out as dierences, say k 
12  k ; it is just convenient for notational purposes to
throw them out from the start. we also note the identities k

longitudinal momentum transfer eects

consider the scattering of two wound strings in iib theory with winding number exchange. we will nd that, in the
regime of small momentum transfer, the interaction is coulombic for resonances involving low enough winding number
exchange, and much weaker otherwise; furthermore, the coulombic interaction is winding number independent, and
the cumulative strength of this potential suggests modifying the matrix string potential by a factor of n/s for
n > s.

for simplicity, consider the polarizations of the external states to be that of the dilaton, and t-dualize the

momentum in the compact direction to winding number. the resulting four string amplitude is given by [96]

(1 + s/4)(1 + t /4)(1 + u /4)
where s  (k1 + k2)2, t  (k2 + k3)2, u  (k1 + k3)2, with s + t + u = 0, and

we want to accord winding n1, n2, n3 and n4 to the four strings, on a circle of radius r; without any momenta along
this cycle, we can extract easily this process from the amplitude above by

thus m  m, and we are in the non-relativistic regime e2
s  t . using this and the identities (z)(1  z) sin(z) =  and (1 + z) = z(z), one obtains the amplitude

where vrel is the relative velocity of strings 1 and 2 in the lab frame.

equation (f.8) has poles at q2 + m2 = 4n/ with n  0. we consider scattering processes probing distances r
much larger than the string scale, qmax  1/r  1/lstr ; we also assume that it is possible to have r  lstr , which we
will see is necessary. given that these poles space the masses of the resonances by the string scale, the dominant term
to the amplitude is the one corresponding to the exchange of a wound ground state, i.e. the n = 0 pole. measuring
quantities in string units, the amplitude then becomes

am  t

sin(q2 + m2)
(q2 + m2)2

.

(f.10)

the eective potential between the strings is the fourier transform of this expression with respect to q. let us

consider various limits. take m  q; we then have m  1. the amplitude becomes

in addition to a larger power in r, we have m  1; this interaction is much weaker than (f.14),(f.15), especially
after averaging over a range of winding transfers m.
we conclude that, for mr = rr(n3  n2)/  1, we have a coulombic potential independent of the winding
exchange m; for mr  1, we have much weaker potentials. this implies that in a gas of winding strings bound in a
ball of size at most of order the string scale, the dominant potential is coulombic with a multiplicative factor given
by w0  /(rr), provided a mechanism restricts winding exchange processes to n3  n2  n1 + n2.
the s-dual of this amplitude describes the scattering of wound d-strings at strong coupling, with winding number
exchange. under a further t duality, and lifting to m theory, this amplitude encodes a good measure of the eects
of longitudinal momentum exchange in the problem of a self-interacting matrix string. the bound on the winding
number translates in our language to

w0 =

gs
r

=

r11
r 

n
s

,

(f.17)

i.e. the resolution in the longitudinal direction. we also note that, under this chain of dualities, the string scale used
to set a bound on the impact parameter r transforms as   , where the latter string scale is that of the matrix
string. this justies our implied equivalence between the scale of r and that of the size of the black hole.

in the single matrix string case we study, we saw that regions of size n/s were strongly correlated and rigid
in a statistical sense. the self-interaction of the large string will then involve processes of coherent exchange of
d-string winding up to the winding number n/s  n . for larger winding, the d-string is not coherent; one expects
a suppression both from the emission vertex and from the highly o-shell propagator. we saw above that all such
processes, up to n/s, are of equal strength and scale coulombically. this implies that the potential between the
string strands calculated from the dbi expansion must be enhanced by a factor of n/s for n > s, and justies the
scaling arguments used in section 4.3.4.
