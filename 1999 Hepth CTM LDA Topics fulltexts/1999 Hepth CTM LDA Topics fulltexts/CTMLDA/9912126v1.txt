abstract

the spin of a glueball is usually taken as coming from the spin (and possibly
the orbital angular momentum) of its constituent gluons. in light of the di-
culties in accounting for the spin of the nucleon from its constituent quarks,
the spin of the glueballs is reexamined. the starting point is the fundamental
qcd eld angular momentum operator written in terms of the chromoelectric
and chromomagnetic elds. first, we look at the restrictions placed on the
structure of the glueballs from the requirement that the qcd eld angular
momenum operator should satisfy the standard commutation relationships.
this can be compared to the electromagnetic charge/monopole system, where
the quantization of the eld angular momentum places restrictions (i.e. the
dirac condition) on the system. second, we look at the expectation value of
this operator under some simplifying assumptions.

i. introduction

one of the results of the 1987 emc experiment [1] was to show that the spin of the
proton did not come solely from the spin of the valence quarks as naive quark models
indicated. after the emc experiment other possible contributing sources to the protons
spin were considered, such as angular momentum from sea quarks, angular momentum from
the orbital motion of valence quarks, and angular momentum from the chromodynamic eld.
in light of this surprise 1 in the make up of the spin of the proton, we want to take
a closer look at the spin of pure glue states. in the case of glueballs there is currently no
absolute experimental evidence for the existence of glueballs (see ref. [3] for the status of
various candidates). thus there is not any urgent need to explain anything in regards to
the spin of the glueballs, since there is no clear cut discrepancy between experiment and the
theoretical models. however, since the simple quark models did not work in accounting for
the spin structure of the proton, it is not an unreasonable assumption that a similar problem
may exist for the simple theoretical models of the glueballs spin. most glueball studies focus
on the mass spectrum of glueballs. here we want to examine the glueballs spin, starting
from the fundamental gluonic eld angular momentum operator (as given below in eq. (1)),
rather than using phenomenological models where the glueballs spin is calculated from the
spins of the constituent, valence gluons from which it is composed.

the gauge-invariant qcd eld angular momentum operator [4] which is responsible for

the glueballs spin is

jgb = z d3x [x  (ea  ba)]

(1)

where ea, ba are the chromoelectric and chromomagnetic elds, and a is an su(3) color
index. except for the color indices this form of the pure gauge eld angular momentum is
similar to the abelian case [5], and like the abelian form contains both spin and orbital
contributions. it is not possible to split eq. (1) into a separate spin and orbital part in
a gauge-invariant way [6] [7]. since eq.
(1) represents the total angular momentum of
the glueball it is required to satisfy the standard quantum mechanical angular momentum
commutation relationship

[j i

gb, j j

gb] = iijkj k

gb

(2)

the main point of this paper is that, in general, one would expect that the requirement of
eq. (2) will place some restrictions on the form of the chromodynamic elds, ea, ba, and
on the structure of the glueballs.

before proceeding with the details of the calculation of [j i

gb] we should ask if it
is physically reasonable that this commutator should place some restrictions on the color
elds. for the electromagnetic interaction there are also systems which carry eld angular
momentum, such as the charge/monopole system. in this example the angular momentum

gb, j j

1in ref. [2] there was already an early hint that the spin of the proton might not be as simple as
quark models indicated

2

commutators do place a restriction on the system [8] : the magnetic charge is restricted
to take on dirac values (i.e. eg = n/2 with n an integer). based on this experience with
e&m one might also expect that eq. (2) would place restrictions on qcd systems. for
qcd systems the angular momentum algebra might yield broader restrictions as compared
to qed. for qed systems with eld angular momentum (e.g. the charge/monopole system
or the charge/magnetic dipole system [9]) one already knows to a very good approximation
the form of the elds, so that the functional form of the eld angular momentum can be
determined analytically. then the commutation rules can be worked out explicitly.
if
on the other hand the functional form of the electromagnetic elds were not known to
such a good approximation (as is the case with the color elds of qcd) then the angular
momentum algebra might lead to broader restrictions (i.e. ruling out a large class of possible
eld congurations).
it would be a greater surprise if any arbitrary form for the elds
satised the angular momentum algebra. there is one subtle point in these electromagnetic
systems with eld angular momentum : the eld angular momentum by itself does not satisfy
the commutation relationships.
it is only the combination of eld plus particle angular
momentum that satises the commutators. here we will nd that a similar restriction
might apply to jgb  that the glueball eld angular momentum may be forced to combine
with some other angular momentum in order to satisfy the commutation relationships.

there are several methods for investigating glueballs. the most rigorous method is via
the numerical calculations of lattice gauge theories. the properties of the glueballs which are
most commonly investigated in this way are their masses, string tension, and deconnement
temperature. in either lattice calculations or in phenomenological models, the spin of the
glueball is determined based on some simplifying assumptions. for example, glueballs can be
f 
associated with such gauge invariant qcd eld strength operators [10] as f a
which are spin 0, or f a
in this last case there is some
ambiguity as to whether these operators should be associated with one glueball of spin 2, or
two glueballs in a d-wave state. usually one chooses the former case for simplicity. however,
we will argue that the angular momentum algebra may restrict glueballs to always be spin
zero, in which case the latter choice would be required. there is also some uncertainty in
the spin assignment of glueballs in lattice studies as pointed out in a recent lattice glueball
review [11]. essentially for a given irreducible representation of the lattice rotational group
there are states with dierent values of total angular momentum which reduce to the same
continuum state. usually one makes the simplest choice and associates a given continuum
state with the lattice state with the minimum value of total angular momentum.

a which are spin 2.

one can also investigate glueballs using various phenomenological models [12], such as
bag models [13] or using massive constituent gluons [14]. both of these approaches roughly
picture the glueballs as composed of two or three valence gluons. the glueball then has a
total spin which is taken as coming from the sum of the orbital and spin angular momentum

of these valence gluons (i.e. jgb = p(li + si) ). this kind of picture is similar in spirit

to the quark models which had the spin of the proton coming from the valence quarks.
since the simple quark models had diculties giving the correct proton spin structure, it is
reasonable to worry that a similar problem may occur with the glueball spin structure.

iii. gluonic field angular momentum

eq. (1) can be recast in index notation as j i

2ijkj jk where

gb = 1
j jk = z d3xm 0jk(~x)

m 0jk are some of the components of the rank 3 tensor m 

m  = t x  t x  m 0jk = t 0kxj  t 0jxk

(3)

(4)

t 0k, t 0j are the time-space components of the energy-momentum tensor t  of the yang-
mills gauge elds

t  =

  f  af  a

  t 0k = f 0i af k a

the yang-mills elds tensors, f 0i a, f ki a are the color electric and color magnetic elds
respectively. in terms of the gauge elds these are

using this string of denitions we now can write down the gluon eld angular momentum
of eq. (1) in index form as

gb = ilm z d3x(cid:16)f 0n af m a
j i

n (cid:17) xl

(7)

iv. angular momentum commutation relationships

in this section we will use the expression in eq. (7) to calculate the commutator for the

pure gluon angular momentum. we will not write out the integrals r d3x.... since these can

always be applied after taking the commutator of the integrand in eq. (7). from eq. (7)
we have

[j i

gb(x), j j

gb(y)] = ilmjpqxlxp[(f 0n a(x)f m a
= ilmjpqxlxp(f 0n af 0r b[f m a
+ f 0r b[f 0n a, f q b

n , f 0r b]f q b
n f q b

r (y))]

(8)

in the last line the x and y dependences have not been written out explicitly. the  s
and xi s have been pulled outside the commutator brackets since they commute with one
another and with f a
. standard commutator algebra has been used to write things in
terms of two term commutators. none of the commutators above will have any non-trivial
contribution coming from the su(3) group structure of the elds, since the f a
  s are all
simply su(3) vector components. another way to see this is to write f a
 in terms of the
t a. using the standard normalization for the group
matrix eld strength tensor, f  f a

4

generators (t r[t at b] = 1
 = 2t r[ft a].
since the group factors have been traced over they will only give trivial commutators for
eq. (8). any possible non-trivial commutation structure in eq. (8) arises, as in ref. [15],
from representing the gauge potentials in terms of creation/annihilation operators.

2ab where t r = trace) f a

 can be written as f a

in the canonical formalism where the gauge potentials are given by creation/annihilation

operators the su(3) gauge elds satisfy the following commutation relationships [16]

[aa

j (y, t)] = iijab3(x  y)
j (y, t)] = [aa

(x, t), ab

(y, t)] = 0

(9)

0ad

j  jab

0 + gf bcdac

j . then using the last commutator in eq.

one can expand the chromoelectric eld in the above commutators as eb
0j =
0ab
(9) only the time
derivative term in the chromoelectric eld expansion gives a nontrivial commutator (i.e.
[aa
j ] = 0 by the last com-
mutator in eq. (9). in the rst example the superscript (y) indicates that the derivative is
taken with respect to y). thus the commutation relationships involving the chromoelectric
eld can be rewritten as

0(y, t)] = 0 and [aa

0(y, t)] = (y)

i (x, t), (y)

i (x, t), ac

i (x, t), ab

j = f b

j(y, t)] = iijab3(x  y)

[aa
[0aa

i (x, t), 0ab

j(y, t)] = 0

(10)

except for the group index kronecker delta these are identical to the eld commutators in
an abelian theory [17].

now in eq. (8) the commutator term [f m a

r ], when expanded in terms of the poten-
tials involves terms like [maa
r ].
by commutator algebra these can all be reduced to sums of commutators like [ac
r ] or
[maa
n, aeq] (i.e. commutators of the gauge
potential with itself or with its spatial derivatives). all the these vanish by the last commu-
tation relationship in eq. (9) thus in eq. (8) [f m a

n, aeq] = m[aa

r] = mq[aa

the remaining terms from eq.

(8) involve commutators between f 0i a and itself or
between , f 0i a and f jk b. these three commutators can be evaluated by expanding f 0i a
and f jk b in terms of the gauge potentials. it is easy to see that the only non-trivial part of
these three commutators comes from the commutation of the time derivative term in f 0i a
(i.e. 0ai a) with the gauge potential (ak b) or its spatial derivative (jak b). since glueballs
are bound states one has the extra physical constraint that the gauge potentials are time
independent 0ai a = 0. taking this physical constraint into account the chromoelectric part
of the eld strength tensor expands into f 0i a = iaa
i . from the commutation
relationships in eqs. (9) and (10) one can see that each of these terms commutes with other
gauge potential components, aa
, or with spatial derivatives of gauge potential components.
thus the commutators for the glueball angular momentum operator yields

0 + gf abcab

0ac

[j i

gb, j j

gb] = 0

(11)

the vanishing of this commutator comes directly from the physical requirement that for
bound states the gauge eld should be time-independent (0ai a = 0). the result given in eq.
(11) may seem strange, but in fact an analogous result arises in the electromagnetic system

5

of a charge and monopole at rest with respect to one another. for this electromagnetic
system one can calculate the eld angular momentum as jem = egr/r, where e, g, r are
the electric charge, magnetic charge and displacement between the two charges respectively.
the commutator of the components of jem with itself gives zero since r/r commutes with
itself. alternatively, one could proceed in the electromagnetic case as in the color eld case
by writing jem out as in eq. (1) in terms of the normal electric and magnetic elds. the
commutator of the components of jem among themselves could then be calculated using the
electromagnetic version of the gauge potential commutators given by eqs. (9) (10) with the
color indices dropped. the only non-trivial terms would come from commutators between
0ai and aj or jak. however, since the electric and magnetic charges are at rest the gauge
elds are time-independent so that 0ai = 0, and one again nds that the commutator for
the components of the electromagnetic eld angular momentum with itself is zero. in the
color eld case this latter method is the only viable one, since for color interaction an explicit
form for ea and ba is not known so that an explicit calculation of jqcd is not possible.
for the electromagnetic system e and b are coulomb elds, and so jem can be calculated
directly.

there are two possible ways of resolving the apparent conict between eqs. (2) and (11).
first, eqs. (2) and (11) are consistent if glueballs are restricted to be spin 0 bound states.
this is not an unreasonable restriction since the identication of the spin of a non-zero spin
glueball is usually based on some simplifying assumptions and/or a phenomenological model
where one deals with constituent gluons. as mentioned previously spin 2 glueballs are usually
connected with qcd operators like f a
a . however, one could instead associate
these objects with two spin 0 glueballs in a d-wave orbital angular momentum state. the
choice of taking these operators to give one spin 2 glueball is a reasonable, simplifying
assumption, but may not be correct in light of the restriction coming from [j i
gb] = 0.
second, one could explain the zero commutator if glueballs did not occur as pure glue
bound states, but always had some admixture of quarks. if the glueball states were mixed
with qq states, these could contribute to the overall spin of the bound state. to take into
account a possible contribution coming from the quarks one would add the total quark
angular momentum operator [4]

(12)

to the pure qcd term of eq. (1)  ~jgb  ~jgb + ~jq. (the two terms in eq. (12) are
associated with the spin and orbital angular momentum of the quarks respectively). this
total angular might then satisfy the eq. (2) with a non-zero term on the right hand side.
such mixing of quarks with glueballs is thought to be suppressed via the 1/nc expansion
approach. however, the restrictions coming from the angular momentum commutators as
discussed above, might be an indication that pure glue states can not exist  that there
will always be some substantial admixture of quarks in order to have the correct angu-
lar momentum commutators. this postulated mixing required by the angular momentum
algebra might explain the diculty in experimentally distinguishing an object as a pure
glueball. this explanation of our result in eq. (11) is also reminiscent of the electromag-
netic charge/monopole system, where it is only the sum of the eld angular momentum plus
the other contributions which satises eq. (2).

v. expectation of jgb

in this section we calculate the expectation value of j i

gb with respect to a glueball state,
|gi under certain simplifying assumptions. from eq. (7) the expectation value is given by

hg|j i

gb|gi = ilm z d3xhg|(cid:16)f 0n a(x)f m a

n (x)(cid:17) |gixl

(13)

0 = 0.

in terms of the operator aa

0 can be split into positive and negative frequency parts  aa

the glueball state is taken to be normalized so that hg|gi = 1. since the eld angular
momentum operator in eq. (7) is gauge invariant we are free to chose a gauge without
eecting the physically measurable quantities like the spin of the glueball. we chose the
temporal gauge where aa
0 we implement this gauge
choice using a gupta-bleuler-like approach by making it a condition on the glueball state 
0|gi = 0. aa
hg|aa
0 +
aa()
. the positive frequency part can be written as a sum of annihilation operators, while
the negative frequency part can be written as a sum of creation operators. thus the gauge
condition hg|aa
0 = 0. next, since the glueball
is a bound state we have the physical (as opposed to gauge) restriction that 0aa
i = 0 which
we will also implement as a condition on the glueball state  hg|0aa
i |gi = 0. this can
also be written in terms of the positive and negative frequency parts as 0aa(+)
|gi = 0
hg|0aa()
= 0. expanding f 0n a in term of the gauge potentials we can write out a portion
of the right hand side of eq. (13) as

0|gi = 0 becomes aa(+)

|gi = 0 and hg|aa()

0 = aa(+)

by using the commutation rules for the non-abelian gauge potentials given by eq. (10)
we will move the various terms coming from f 0n a through f m a
and then apply either the
gauge condition aa(+)
|gi = 0 or the physical condition 0aa(+)
|gi = 0. in order to apply
the commutators of eq. (10) we have changed f 0n a(x) to f 0n a(y). in the end we will let
y  x. in eq. (14) f 0n a as expanded in terms of the aas has both positive and negative
frequency parts, but the negative frequency parts will vanish directly when hg| is applied to
the left side of eq. (14). thus as we pull f 0n a through f m a
n we are only dealing with the
positive frequency parts even though the subscript (+) will not be written out explicitly. the
last term in f 0n a (gf abca0b(y)anc(y)) can be trivially commuted past f m a
(x) since both
a0b(y) and anc(y) commute with other gauge elds components or their spatial derivatives
by the last commutator in eq. (9). after this term is commuted through f m a

the rst term above is zero because of the  function. the integral in the second term can
be evaluated using the  function. it equals the kronecker delta, ml. thus we can nally
write the expectation of j i

gb as

hg|j i

gb|gi = iilmml = 0

(22)

0

|gi = 0 ; hg|aa()

using the properties of the s and s. thus by imposing the temporal gauge condition
(aa(+)
0 = 0) and the physical condition that for a bound state the gauge
elds should be time independent (0aia(+)|gi = 0 ; hg|0aia() = 0) it is found that
hg|j i

gb|gi = 0.

vi. conclusions

by examining the commutation relationships ([j i

gb]) and the expectation value
(hg|j i
gb|gi) of the glueball angular momentum operator it was found that both of these
quantities were zero. the main assumption in both of these results was that the gauge

gb, j j

8

elds were time-independent (0aia = 0), since the glueball is a bound state. the non-
abelian nature of the gauge elds played little role in the commutation relationships of
j i
gb, since the group indices were traced over in the expression of j i
gb. thus one would
expect that a similar result ([j i
em is the electromagnetic eld angular
momentum) should hold for abelian gauge elds (a) under similar conditions (0ai = 0).
for the two abelian examples were this has been worked out explicitly (the monopole/charge
system and the magnetic dipole/charge system [9]) it is in fact found that the eld angular
momentum, by itself, does not satisfy the angular momentum commutation relationships.
in light of these abelian examples, and the similarity between j i
em the results for
the glueball angular momentum operator are not so surprising.

em ] = 0 where j i

em , j j

gb] and hg|j i

there are several possible resolutions/explanations for these zero results for j i

gb. first,
the fact that both [j i
gb|gi are zero may imply that pure glueballs can only
be spin zero. operators like f a
a are usually associated with spin 2 glueballs. however,
this association is based mostly on simplicity, since one could equally connect this operator
with two spin 0 glueballs in a relative d-state. second, the above results may indicate that
glueballs will always have some signicant admixture of quarks, which will play a major role
in the spin structure of the glueball. this is similar to the situation in e&m where, for the
static eld examples of the charge/monopole system or the charge/magnetic dipole system,
the eld angular momentum by itself does not satisfy the standard angular momentum
commutators.
it is only the combination of eld plus particle angular momentum which
satises eq. (2). given the similarity between the qed and qcd eld angular momentum
operators and the eld commutators this may be the most likely explanation. it may also
be connected with the diculty in distinguishing pure glueball states experimentally.
