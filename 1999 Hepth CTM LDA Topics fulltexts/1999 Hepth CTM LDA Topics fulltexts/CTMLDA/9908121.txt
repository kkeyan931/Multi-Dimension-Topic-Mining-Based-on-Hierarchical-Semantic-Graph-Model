(1.2) consequently, two types dp-branes p, denote dp+ dp, carry one unit charge c (p+1) , respectively. relation charges charges r-r elds (1.1) given c (p+1) + q = 1 2 (q q) . (1.3) type 0 theory obtained orientifold type 0b {$9803194$}, orbifold (1)fs type {$9701137$}. projection type (1)fs eliminates fermions spectrum. (massless) untwisted sector given metric, dilaton, r-r 2-form c (2), sector (r+, r+). twisted sector introduces tachyon (n s, n s) second r-r 2-form c (2) sector (r, r). orbifold (1)fs eect diagonal gso projection. accordingly, contribution klein bottle one-loop vacuum amplitude gives rise ns-ns massless tadpole tree channel, hence orientifold xed plane type 0 carries r-r charge3. ns-ns tadpole render theory necessarily inconsistent, hence principle need introduce 2these signs refer worldsheet fermion numbers left right moving sectors, i.e. eigenvalues (1)fl (1)fr, respectively. 3the klein-bottle contribution type 0 double type case, one could consider one orientifold one anti-orientifold {$9904207$} type 0 {$9904207$}. however, since carry r-r charge, cannot distinguished type 0. 3 d9-branes, could without open-string sector theory. ns-ns fact removed fischler-susskind mechanism {$9803194$}, introduces spacetime dependent coupling. tadpole cancellation type 0 ns-ns tadpole type 0 also canceled adding d9-branes, introduce open sector theory. since cylinder diagram contributes r-r massless tadpole, must canceled d9-branes themselves, hence take equal number d9-branes anti d9-branes. cancellation ns-ns tadpole tells us number branes introduced n = 32: sn = v10z 0 2 (82)(cid:18)1 2 (2n)2e2 + 16(n 32)2(cid:19) . (1.4) exponentially divergent term tachyon tadpole, expected theory tachyon closed string spectrum. thus type 0 string theory without tadpoles gauge group so(32) so(32). hand, know type 0b contains two types dp-branes p odd. implies also two types d9-branes type 0 theory . thus regarding type 0 theory type 0b orientifold, dierent possible combinations d9-branes cancel tadpoles. generic case system n d9+ branes 32 n d9 branes, respective antibranes. conguration originates gauge group so(n) so(32 n) so(n)so(32n), r-r ns-ns massless tadpoles vanish. moreover, tachyon tadpole slightly changed: sn = v10z 0 (82) (32 2n)2 e2 , (1.5) vanishes n = 16. situation 16 d9+ 16 d9 branes respective antibranes, equivalent 16 bound states form d9 plus corresponding antibranes. fact tachyon tadpole vanishes4 specic conguration consistent fact potential d9 bound states proportional potential type d9- branes. one concludes point view type 0b orientifold, type 0 without tadpoles general so(n) so(32 n) so(n) so(32 n) symmetry. 4although closed string tachyon appear cylinder amplitude n = 16, appear torus amplitude. 4 type 0 orbifold type generic conguration d9-branes gauge group so(n)so(32n) so(n) so(32 n) also made consistent orbifold construction type 0 type i5. consider gauge transformation = l1n 0 0 l132n ! , acts chan-paton factors open string states | . . .i | . . .i ii 1 . (1.6) (1.7) orbifold6 type (1)fs yields type 0 theory gauge group so(n)so(32n)so(n)so(32n). construction goes schematically follows. group element makes natural division 32 d9-branes type two sets, one n branes one 32 n branes. accordingly, chan-paton factors open strings divided = b c ! , (1.8) n n matrix associated n d9-branes rst set, (32 n) (32 n) matrix associated 32 n d9-branes. b c chan-paton factors open strings stretching one n branes rst set another one second set 32 n branes. orbifolding (1)fs eliminate fermions open strings begin end branes set, bosons open strings end brane either set. gauge group so(32) thus broken so(n) so(32 n) left massless fermions (n, 32 n) representation. implies 32 d9-branes become n d9-branes one type 32 n d9-branes one, either d9+ d9. anti d9-branes considered coming twisted sector orbifold (1)fs i. implementing orbifold projection twisted sector nd n anti d9-branes one type 32 n type. moreover, tadpole cancellation7 imposes n anti d9-branes must type 5this extents result {$9701137$}, so(32) so(32) case obtained orbifold 6this type projection used previously {$9904207$} connect d3-brane type iib type i. d3 bound state type 0b. 7one might think ambiguity choice type brane twisted sector. however, conguration n d9+ branes, 32 n d9 branes, 32 n anti d9+ branes n anti d9 branes, tachyon tadpole vanishes n , r-r tadpole would vanish n = 16. 5 type iib fs (-1) fs (-1) type 0b type type 0 figure 1: type 0 theory. graphic shows construct type 0 theory type 0b type i, gauge group form so(n )so(32n )so(n )so(32n ). operator determines n construction type i. choice corresponds orientifold case certain gauge freedom order choose types branes canceling tadpole. n d9-branes untwisted sector, similarly 32 n d9-branes. operation act closed string spectrum. thus orbifolding type (1)fsi obtain closed spectrum before. finally, obtain type 0 theory group so(n) so(32 n) so(n) so(32 n), containing d9+ d9 branes. finally, would like emphasize introduction d9-branes completely arbitrary, since r-r tadpole cancel ns-ns tadpole harmless treated fischler-susskind mechanism {$9803194$}. accordingly, consider generic type 0 theory n d9+ branes d9 branes, corresponding antibranes. gauge group so(n) so(m) so(n) so(m) ns-ns tadpole unless n + = 32. particular, consider type 0 d9-branes all, hence open sector would absent. consider generic backgrounds type 0. transition one case less branes seen produced annihilation d9 anti-d9 pairs vacuum, open string tachyon condenses restoring vacuum. section 3 propose alternative tachyon condensation d9 anti-d9 pair gives rise non-bps d8-brane. proceed description non-bps d8-brane. 2 stable d8-brane type 0 using descent relations d-branes type ii theories , one construct non-bps d(2p)-brane type iib theory. obtained either d(2p + 1) anti-d(2p + 1) pair type iib, d(2p) anti-d(2p) pair 6 type iia. extend relations type 0a/0b theories. instance, d(2p + 1)+ anti-d(2p + 1)+ pair type 0b non-bps d(2p)+ brane associated tachyonic kink solution. construction goes like type ii, except r-sector absent. non-bps d(2p)+ brane also constructed d(2p)+ anti-d(2p)+ pair type 0a. order obtain this, argue orbifold projection type 0a (0b) (1)f l yields type 0b (0a), (1)f l spacetime fermion-number left-movers acts minus sign r-r sectors. way start d8+ anti-d8+ pair type 0a projecting (1)f l obtain non-bps d8+-brane type 0b, else, construct non-bps d8+ brane kink solution tachyon potential d9+ anti-d9+ pair type 0b. low-energy eld content non-bps d8+ brane type 0b non-bps d8-brane type iib without fermions: u(1) vector, transversal scalar tachyon. also obtained non-bps d8-brane type iib projecting orbifold (1)fs. notice choose two types branes, either dp+ dp. distinguish non-bps d8+ non-bps d8 type 0b low energies sign coupling closed string tachyon. order see compare cylinder amplitude two non-bps d8+ branes ad8+d8+ = v9z 0 dt 2t (82t) 9 2 e 2 2 3 (et) f 8 f 8 1 (et) , amplitude non-bps d8+ non-bps d8: f 8 2 (et) f 8 1 (et) ad8+d8 = v9z (82t) 9 dt 2t 2 e 2 2 0 . (2.1) (2.2) factorize cylinder closed string channel, expanding small t. nd thus conclude couple dierent sign closed string tachyon. notice also bound state d8 cylinder amplitude propor- tional non-bps d8-brane type iib. order obtain d8+ brane type 0 theory must consider projection d8+ brane type 0b. {$9803194$} know action 8-8 strings following.

used project n tachyons. also keeps 32 n tachyons, coming strings stretching d8-brane 32 n d9-branes9. twisted sector one 32 anti-d9-branes, give rise 32 extra tachyons 8-9 sector. finally, one performs projection onto invariant states transformation (2.9). result obtain 2(32 n) tachyons coming d8+-d9+ d8+-anti-d9+ sectors, similarly, d8-d9 d8-anti-d9 sectors. particular, using procedure obtain stable d8-brane type 0 so(32) so(32) gauge group case = l132. thus nd non-bps d8+ (d8) branes stable d9 (d9+) branes background. stable d8-brane type 0 without d9-branes make choice introducing
