using the gaussian wave-functional approach with the normal-ordering renormalization prescrip-
tion, we show that for the (3+1)-dimensional massive 4 theory, precarious and autonomous
4s can exist if and only if the normal-ordering mass is equal to the classical masses at the symmetric
and asymmetric vacua, respectively.

the triviality problem of quantum eld theories, for example, the 4 theories, is very important and has been
receiving lots of investigations since the early 1970s [1]. in general, it is believed that (d+1)-dimensional eld theories
(d  3) have been proved to be trivial (i.e, to be non-interacting or else inconsistent). in the 1980s, nevertheless, p.
m. stevenson and his collaborators took a new view of the (3+1)-dimensional 4 theory and accordingly proposed
two non-trivial 4 theories : percarious 4 and autonomous 4. within the framework of the gaussian wave-
functional approch (gwfa), for the case of the negative and innitesimal bare coupling, stevenson renormalized the
(3+1)-dimensional 4 theory by a set of renormalization conditions of the mass and coupling parameters at the zero
vacuum expectation value (vev) of eld operator, and obtained a non-trivial theory called precarious 4 [2]; for the
case of the positive and innitesimal bare coupling, stevenson and tarrach also renormalized the (3+1)-dimensional
4 theory by another set of renormalization conditions of the mass and coupling parameters at the zero vev of
eld operator and further by an innite wavefunction renormalization condition, and obtained the other non-trivial
theory called autonomous 4 [3]. precarious 4 has a stable, symmetric phase [2], whereas autonomous 4
can exhibit either a massless symmetry phase or a massive broken-symmetry phase [3]. since the two non-trivial
theories were proposed, they have attracted much attention. these two non-trivial theories were demonstrated to
exist in o(n)-symmetric 4 theory [4], and their generalizations to many other complicated models were made,
too [5]. furthermore, it was shown that in the context of dimensional regularization, precarious 4 arises as the
(d+1) (4)+ limit of the (d+1)-dimensional 4 theory with d > 3, whereas autonomous 4 can be understood as
limit of the (d+1)-dimensional 4 theory with d < 3 [6]. again, precarious and autonomous
the (d+1) (4)
4s were discussed by some methods beyond the gaussian approximation, and the existence of autonomous 4 was
still demonstrated but those methods did not all conrm the appearance of precarious 4 [7]. besides, autonomous
4 arising from the classical pure 4 theory (massless) was believed to not conict with triviality, and used in
relevant models to predict a 2.2 tev higgs boson [8].



to our knowledge, no work discussed the dependences of precarious and autonomous 4s upon renormalization
points. this is perhaps because results obtained from the gwfa with the standard renormalization prescription 1
[9] are exactly renormalization-group invariant [2] (1985, sect.iii). however, although precarious 4 was obtained
according to the standard renomalization prescription, an approximation was made in renormalizing the coupling
parameter [2], and as for the autonomous 4, an unusual set of renormalization conditions was proposed within
the framework of the gwfa [3]. on the other hand, as was mensioned above, it was at a peculiar renormalization
point, the zero vev of eld operator, that both precarious and autonomous 4s were demonstrated to exist [2,3].
therefore, it is necessary and important to consider whether precarious and autonomous 4s would exist or not
when the (3+1)-dimensional 4 theory is renormalized at any other renormalization points. in this letter, we intend
to address this problem.

for the above problem, the renormalization prescriptions utilized by stevenson et al [2,3] are not too convenient be-
cause it must be executed at a explicit renormalization point given previously. nevertheless, within the framework of
the gwfa, executing the standard renormalization prescription [9] is equivalent to executing colemans renormaliza-
tion prescription [1013], and further, executing a renormalization procedure at dierent renomalized points amounts
to choosing dierent values of the normal-ordering mass in colemans normal-ordering renormalization prescription
[11]. thus, if colemans normal-ordering renormalization prescription is adopted, the dependence of a eld theory
on renomalization points will be equivalent to the dependence of that theory on the normal-ordering mass. luckily,
colemans renormalization prescription can be performed at any normal-ordering mass which neednt be explicitly

1in the standard renormalization prescription of the gwfa, the denitions of renormalized physical parameters resemble
those in the classical theory concerned.

given, and this is evidently convenient for the purpose here. hence, in order to know if the existences of precarious
and autonomous 4s depend upon renormalization points, it is sucient to renormalize the (3+1)-dimensional 4
theory on the basis of colemans normal-ordering renormalization prescription and pay attention to the dependence
of precarious and autonomous 4s upon values of the normal-ordering mass instead of the renormalization points.
in the following, based on colemans normal-ordering renormalization prescription, we shall analyse the gaussian
eective potential (gep) of the (3+1)-dimensional massive 4 theory, manage to turn the gep nite, and accord-
ingly show that precarious and autonomous 4s appear only at two particular values of the normal-ordering
mass,respectively.

where px, x and fxy are variational parameter-functions. nf is some normalization constant, and depends upon fxy.
with respect to any normal-ordering mass m (an arbitrary positive constant with the dimension of mass), one can
nomal-order the hamiltonian density in eq.(2) according to ref. [10], and has

here, p = |~p|, and nm [] denotes normal-ordering with respect to m . following the refs. [1113], one can rst
calculate the energy rx < |nm [hx]| >, then take x as a constant , and nally, minimize variationally the
energy with respect to p as well as f to obtain the gep. consequently, px = 0, the fourier component of fxy is
f (p) = pp2 + 2(), and the gep has the following expression

with the gap  = () satisfying

for the lower-dimensional cases (d < 3), the corresponding gep contains no divergences [13], and no further
renormalization precedure need to be considered. however, in the present case, the situation is completely dierent
and the right hands of eqs.(6) and (7) are still full of divergences. hence, we have to nd a further renormalization
scheme for making the gep nite. next, let us analyse those divergences appeared in eqs.(6) and (7).

where i2(m 2) is a logarithmic divergent integral. substituting the last two equations into eqs.(6) and (7), one
can see that a logarithmic divergence exists in eq.(7) and the right hand of eq.(6) has the terms with logarithmic
divergences squared at most, except for divergent constants (independent of ). it is well known that in the case
of lower dimensions, colemans normal-ordering renormalization prescription amounts to the renormalization of the
mass parameter [13,2] (1985), and the relation between the bare and renormalized coupling parameters is in fact a
nite relation [2](1985). thus, generally, for the present case, in order to get rid of the divergences in eqs.(6) and (7),
perhaps we should consider further a real renormalization of the coupling parameter and an innite renormalization
of the wave-function. that is to say, the coupling parameter and the eld  should be so appropriately redened
or innitely re-scaled that those divergences both in eq.(6) and in eq.(7) can cancel out, respectively, except for
divergent constants in eq.(6).

from the above analysis, we take

 = a1i1

2 (m 2) + a2i2

2 (m 2),

2 = bi2(m 2)2

(10)

with a1 and b being some constants to be determined. note that for b, what is necessary is only to determine it up to
a nite rescaling of  [3]. in the ansatz eq.(10), a2 should be a parameter relevant to renormalized counterpart of the
bare coupling , r, with a nite relation, if eq.(10) can really renormalize the theory. analysing eqs.(6) and (7), one
can see that the ansatz eq.(10) should has contained all possibilities to remove various divergences both in eqs.(6)
and (7), and other ansatzes would not either remove those divergences or lead to a new result. substituting eq.(10)
into eq.(6), one can nd that those divergences in eq.(7) cancel out, and eq.(6) has only two types of divergent terms
: 2i2(m 2) and 4i2(m ), except for the divergent constant d  v ( = 0). then taking the coecients of 2i2(m )
and 4i2(m ) terms as zero, respectively, leads to

(cid:26) b(m2+3a1m 2)

2(1+3a1) = 0
(1  6a1) = 0

a1b2
1+3a1

(11)

and consequently the gep in eq.(6) also contains no divergences, except for d. thus, the solutions for the set of
equations eq.(11) will be helpful to determine the renormalization schemes.

obviously, there are three solutions for the set of equations eq.(11):

(i).
(ii).
(iii).

a1 =  1

a1 = 1
6 ,

b = i1
b = i1
m 2 = 2m2,

2 (m 2) ;
2 (m 2), m 2 = m2 ;
b is nite .

(12)

in the strict sense of mathematics, ii in eq.(12) cannot be regarded as a solution of eq.(11), because in the second
equation of eq.(11) it leads to the innitesimal b2 dividing by zero 2. nevertheless, ii in eq.(12) can really get rid of
those divergences in eqs.(6) and (7). in fact, in eqs.(6) and (7) with eq.(10), there is not the denominator (1 + 3a1) at
all, and the appearance of this denominator is due to a mathematical deformation of rewriting eq.(7). additionally,
although the solution (i) can make eqs.(6) and (7) have no explicit divergences (of course except for a divergent
constant in eq.(6)), it means that  is nite and therefore does not produce a viable theory, for the vacuum could
become unstable [2]. in view of this, in the following, we discuss the other two solutions.

the solution (ii) in eq.(12) implies that it is not necessary to perform the wave-function renormalization. for the

convenience of comparison with ref. [2], let a2 = k

with d1 being a divergent constant. eqs.(14) and (15) are identical to eqs.(5.9) and (5.10) in ref. [2](1985), respec-
tively. thus, we reproduce precarious 4 [2]. however, as has been seen in the above, only when m 2 = m2, can
the divergences be removed, and therefore, if and only if m 2 = m2, precarious 4 exists. by the way, because m 2
must be positive, precarious 4 corresponds to eq.(1) with m2 > 0. that is to say, if and only if the classical mass
in the case of m2 > 0 and  < 0 is taken as the normal-ordering mass, precarious 4 can appear. this also implies
that precarious 4 arises from only the symmetrical phase of the classical theory.
now we are in a position to discuss the solution (iii). in this case, we take a2 =  1

with d2 the divergent constant. eq.(17) is the gep obtained by the scheme eq.(16). a numerical analysis indicates
that so long as r is not too small the ssb remains to exist, whereas if r is small the vacuum enjoys its symmetry
[13].

owing to i2(x)  i2(y) =  1

it is evident that the expression of eq.(20) is identical to that of autonomous 4 in ref. [3] when setting m2

0 =
242 (1 + ln 2
m 2 ). here, we have seen that in the present case, if and only if we make a special choice of normal-
ordering mass, i.e., m 2 = 2m2, the gep is renormalized and autonomous 4 exist. contrary to precarious 4,
autonomous 4 corresponds to eq.(1) with m2 < 0, and originates from the asymmetrical phase of the classical
theory. that is to say, only when the classical mass in the case of m2 < 0 and  > 0 is chosen as the normal-ordering
mass, autonomous 4 appears.

perhaps one must have noticed that  in eq.(16) or eq.(19) is just eq.(9) in ref. [3] 3. in the same way as eq.(19)
is derived, one also can rewite  in eq.(13) and nd that  in eq.(13) is just eq.(5.5) in ref. [2](1985). further, simple

3note that i2(2) here is equal to 2i1() in ref. [3].

calculations of ( = 0) from eq.(7) and  in eqs.(13) and (16) indicate that m 2 = m2 is really consistent with
the renormalization condition of the mass in ref. [2], and m 2 = 2m2 consistent with eq.(10) of ref. [3] 4. so the
renormalization scheme eq.(13) is equivalent to that in ref. [2], and the renormalization scheme eq.(16) equivalent
to the scheme eqs.(9),(10) and (11) in ref. [2]. that is to say, the two values of the normal-ordering mass in the
treatment here, m for the case of m2 > 0 and  < 0 and 2m2 for the case of m2 < 0 and  > 0, correspond

to the renormalization point  = 0 chosen for the case of  < 0 in ref. [2] and for the case of  > 0 in ref. [3],
respectively. because other choices of the normal-ordering mass can not yield a renormalized and non-trivial theory,
the existence of both precarious 4 and autonomous 4 is crucially dependent upon the normal-ordering mass
(or renormalization points).

in the same way, we have also considered the o(n)-symmetric 4 theory and obtained an analogous conclusion.
that is, for the o(n)-symmetric 4 theory, precarious and autonomous 4s in ref. [4] exist only at m 2 = m2
(m2 > 0) and at m 2 =  2m2
(m2 < 0), respectively. note that the value m 2 = m2 is just the classical mass
with the symmetric vacuum and m 2 =  2m2
the one with the asymmetric vacuum. thus, we conclude that
the existence of precarious and autonomous 4s is uniquely at the respective particular values of the normal-
ordering mass the respective classical masses. besides, we want to emphasize that as has been shown in the derivation
of this paper, if any other positive value (not the classical mass) is chosen as the normal-ordering mass, not only
the precarious and autonomous 4s disappear, but also the massive 4 with (3+1) dimensions is either trivial
or non-renormalizable for any  within the framework of the gwfa. finally, it should be mentioned that because
normal-ordering mass must be greater than zero, the conclusion in this paper is not valid for the massless 4 theory.
