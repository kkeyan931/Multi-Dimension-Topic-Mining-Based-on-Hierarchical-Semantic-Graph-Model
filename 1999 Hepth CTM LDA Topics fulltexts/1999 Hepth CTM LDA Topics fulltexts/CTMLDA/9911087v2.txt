abstract

we propose a resolution for the fermion doubling problem in dis-
crete eld theories based on the fuzzy sphere and its cartesian prod-
ucts.

the nonperturbative formulation of chiral gauge theories is a long stand-
ing programme in particle physics. it seems clear that one should regularise
these theories with all symmetries intact. there are two major problems as-
sociated with conventional lattice approaches to this programme, both with
roots in topological features: (1) the well-known nielsen-ninomiya theo-
rem [1] states that if we want to maintain chiral symmetry, then under plau-
sible assumptions, one cannot avoid the doubling of fermions in the usual
lattice formulations . (2) it is not straightforward to understand features
like anomalies with naive ultraviolet cut-o.

recently a novel approach to discrete physics has been developed.

it
works with quantum elds on a fuzzy space mf obtained by treating the
underlying manifold m as a phase space and quantising it [29]. the earliest
contributions to topological features of the emergent fuzzy physics came from
grosse, klimck and presnajder [4]. they dealt with monopoles and chiral
anomaly for the fuzzy two-sphere s2
f and took particular advantage of super-
symmetry . later baez et al. [10] further elaborated on their monopole work
and developed the fuzzy physics of  models and their solitons using cyclic
cohomology [11, 12]. an attractive feature of this cohomological approach

1

is its ability to write analogues of continuum winding number formulae and
derive a fuzzy belavin-polyakov bound [10].

in this paper, we propose a solution of the fermion doubling problem for
m = s2 using fuzzy physics . an alternative approach, also using fuzzy
physics, can be found in [4] while further developments of our method with
applications to instantons and chiral anomaly is reported in [13].there have
also been important developments [14] in the theory of chiral fermions and
anomalies in the usual lattice formulations. they avoid fermion doubling by
relaxing the requirement that chirality and dirac operators anticommute. in
contrast, fuzzy physics needs no such relaxation.

quantisable adjoint orbits of compact semi-simple lie groups seem amenable

to the full fuzzy treatment and lead to manageable nite dimensional matrix
models for quantum elds . there are two such manifolds in dimension four,
namely s2s2 and cp2 . our methods readily extend to s2s2. they
are not anticipated to encounter obstructions for cp2 as well. but we have
not yet fully worked out its noncommutative geometry. the published work
of grosse and strohmaier [15] on cp2 gives their description of fuzzy 4d
fermions.

a sphere s2 is a submanifold of r3:

s2 = h~n  r3 :

n2

i = 1i.

xi=1

(1)

if ni are the coordinate functions on s2, ni(~n) = ni, then ni commute and the
algebra a of smooth functions they generate is commutative. in contrast,
the operators xi describing s2

f are noncommutative:

[xi, xj] =

iijkxk

[l(l + 1)]1/2 ,

3

xi=1

x2
i = 1,

l  {

. . . }.

(2)

the xi commute and become ni in the limit l  . if li = [l(l + 1)]1/2xi,
i = l(l + 1), so that li give the irreducible
representation (irr) of the su(2) lie algebra for angular momentum l. li
or xi generate the algebra a = m2l+1 of (2l + 1)  (2l + 1) matrices.

then [li, lj] = iijklk and p l2

scalar wave functions on s2 come from elements of a. in a similar way,
elements of a assume the role of scalar wave functions on s2
f . a scalar
product on a is h, i = t r. a acts on this hilbert space by left- and
right- multiplications giving rise to the left and right- regular representations

2

al,r of a. for each a  a, we thus have operators al,r  al,r acting on
  a according to al = a, ar = a.
[note that albl = (ab)l while
arbr = (ba)r.] we assume by convention that elements of al are to be
identied with fuzzy versions of functions on s2. note that there are two
kinds of angular momentum operators ll
f . the orbital
i . ~l
angular momentum operator, which should annihilate 1, is li = ll
plays the role of the continuum i(~r  ~).

the construction of the dirac operator is of crucial importance for fuzzy
physics. the following two dirac operators on s2 have occurred in the fuzzy
literature :

d1 = ~.[i(~r  ~)] + 1,
d2 = ijkinjjk,

where

jk = [i(~x  ~)]k + k/2 = total angular momentum operators .

there is a common chirality operator  anticommuting with both:

 = ~.n = , 2 = 1,

d + d = 0.

these dirac operators in the continuum are unitarily equivalent,

d2 = exp (i/4)d1 exp (i/4)

= id1,

and have the spectrum

spectrum of d = {(j + 1/2) : j  {1/2, 3/2, . . . }},

(3)
(4)

(9)

where j is total angular momentum (spectrum of ~j 2 = {j(j + 1)} ).

since |d| ( positive square root of d2

 ) for both  share the same
spectrum and eigenvectors by (9) and rotational invariance, |d1| = |d2|.
further being multiples of unity for each xed j, they commute with the
rotationally invariant . as they are invertible too, we have the important
identity

the discrete version of d1 is:

its spectrum is

we let j(j + 1) denote the eigenvalues of ~j 2. then for ~l2 = k(k + 1), k 
{0, 1, . . . 2l}, if j = k + 1/2 we get +(j + 1/2) as eigenvalue of d1, while if
j = k  1/2 we get (j + 1/2). the absence of (2l + 1/2) in (12) is just
because k cuts o at 2l.(the same derivation works also for d1).

the discrete version of d2 is :

d2 = ijkixl

j jk = ijkixl

(16)

d2 is no longer unitarily equivalent to d1, its spectrum being [7, 8]

(17)

the rst operator has been used extensively by grosse et al [46] while
the second was rst introduced by watamuras [7, 8]. it is remarkable that
the eigenvalues (12) coincide exactly with those of d upto j = (2l  1/2). in
contrast d2 has zero modes when j = 2l + 1
2 and very small eigenvalues for
large values of j, both being absent for d . so d1 is a better approximation
to d.

but d1 as it stands admits no chirality operator anti-commuting with it.
this is easy to see as its top eigenvalue does not have its negative in the
spectrum. instead d2 has the nice feature of admitting a chirality operator:
the eigenvalue for top j, even though it has no pair, is exactly zero. so the
best fuzzy dirac operator has to combine the good properties of d1 and d2.
we suggest it to be d1 after projecting out its top j mode. we will show
that it then admits a chirality with the correct continuum limit .

the chirality operator anticommuting with d2 and squaring to 1 in the

entire hilbert space is

~.~lr  1/2

l + 1/2

,

2 = 

2 = 

2
2 = 1.

(18)

(19)

an interpretation of 2 is that (12)/2 are projectors to subspaces where
(~lr +~/2)2 have values (l 1
2 + 1) [10]. from (16) follows the identity

2 )(l 1

[d1, 2] =  2 i  d2;  = s1 

1

(2l + 1)2 .

(20)

 and |d|( nonnegative square root of d2

now d2
) are multiples of identity
for each xed j, and 2 commutes with ~j . hence they mutually commute :

[a, b] = 0 for a , b = d2

 , |d| or 2 .

(21)

therefore from (20),

{d1, d2} =

in addition we can see that

1
2i

[d2

1, 2] = 0.

(22)

[d2

, d] = [|d|, d] = 0.

(23)

if

 =

d
|d|

on the subspace v with j  2l  1/2,

= 0

on the subspace w with j = 2l + 1/2.

(24)

it follows that

e1 = 1 , e2 = 2 , e3 = i12

(25)

generate a cliord algebra on v . that is, if p is the orthogonal projector
on v ,

then

p  = ,
= 0,

  v,
  w,

{e, e} = 2p.

(26)

(27)

all this allows us to infer that {e3, d1} = 0 so that it is a chirality operator
for either d1 or its restriction p d1p to v .in addition,in view of (10, 25), it
has the correct continuum limit as well so that it is a good choice for chirality
in that respect too .

a unitary transformation of e3 and d1 will not disturb their nice features.
such a transformation bringing e3 to 2 on v is convenient .
it can be
constructed as follows . e and 2 being rotational scalars leave the two-
dimensional subspaces in v with xed values of ~j 2 and j3 invariant . on
this subspace, e and unity form a basis for linear operators, so 2 is their
linear combination . as e1,e3 and 2 anticommute with e2,and all square to
1, in this subspace , we infer that 2 is a transform by a unitary operator
u = exp(ie2/2) of e3 in each such subspace . and  can depend only on

6

~j 2 by rotational invariance . thus we can replace p d1p and e3 by the new
dirac and chirality operators

d = e(i(j 2)2)/2(p d1p )e(i(j 2)2)/2,
 : = p 2p = e(i(j 2)2)/2(i12)e(i(j 2)2)/2

= cos (j 2)(i12) + sin (j 2)1.

(28)

the coecients can be determined by taking traces with 1 and i12 .

we have established that chiral fermions can be dened on s2

f with no
fermion doubling, at least in the absence of fuzzy monopoles. we next extend
this result to include them as well.

in the continuum, monopoles and instantons
monopoles and instantons:
are particular connection elds  on certain twisted bundles over the base
manifold m. on s2, they are monopole bundles, on s4 or cp2, they can be
su(2) bundles.

in algebraic k-theory, it is well-known that these bundles are associated
with projectors p [11, 12, 16]. p is a matrix of some dimension m with
pij  a  c(m), p 2 = p = p . the physical meaning of p is the
following. let am = a  cm = { = (1, 2 . . . m ) : i  a}. then
pam = {p :   am } consists of smooth sections (or wave functions)
p of a vector bundle over m. for suitable choices of p, we get monopole
or instanton vector bundles. these projectors are known [16] and those for
monopoles have been reproduced in [10].

the projectors p(n ) for fuzzy monopoles of charge n have also been
explicitly found in [10]. they act on a2n
= { with components b1...bn 
a, bi  {1, 2}}. let ~ (i) (i = 1, 2, . . . n) be commuting pauli matrices. ~ (i)
has the normal action on the index bi and does not aect bj (j 6= i). then

~k = ~ll +pi ~ (i)/2 generates the su(2) lie algebra and p(n ) (p(n )) is the

projector to the maximum (minimum) angular momentum kmax = l + n/2
[ ~k 2p(n ) = kmax(kmax + 1)p(n ), ~k 2p(n ) = kmin(kmin +
(kmin = l  n/2).
1)p(n ).] fuzzy analogues of monopole wave functions are p(n )a2n
. when
c2 = p(n )a2n+1 =
spin is included, we must enhance p(n )a2n
{ with components b1...bn ,j  a : bi, j  {1, 2}}.

to p(n )a2n

the complications to be resolved now are caused by the need to project
out a subspace of a2n+1. it is the analogue of the subspace projected out

7

by p for n = 0. in its absence, for example in the continuum, there is a
canonical way due to connes [11] for extending cyclic cohomology to twisted
bundles.

in the n = 0 sector, the projector p cuts out the subspace w of a2.
and thence to p(n )a2n+1 by including spin, the
when we pass to p(n )a2n
subspace to be projected out is not determined by p if n 6= 0, as we shall
see below. rather, we can explain it as follows: let ~j = ~k  ~lr + ~/2
be the total angular momentum. calling ~j by this name is appropriate
as its components become (15) for n = 0 and displays the known spin-
isospin mixing [17] for n 6= 0. the maximum of ~j 2 on p(n )a2n+1 is
jmax(jmax + 1), jmax = (l  n/2) + l + 1/2 = 2l  n/2 + 1/2. [we assume that
2l  (n 1)/2.] the vectors to be projected out are those with total angular
momentum jmax. if j (n ) are the corresponding projectors [with j (0) = p ],
the twisted space we work with is j (n )p(n )a2n+1. since p(n ) commute
with ~j and hence with j (n ), q(n ) = j (n )p(n ) are also projectors.

there is no degeneracy for angular momentum jmax in p(n )a2n+1. that
is because there is only one way to couple l  n/2, l and 1/2 to jmax. the
space (1  j (n ))p(n )a2n+1 is thus of dimension 2jmax + 1. we want to get
rid of this subspace.

the operators t = d or  are zero on (1  p )a2 where p cuts out states
of angular momentum 2l + 1/2. there is no degeneracy for this angular
( a2n+1) as
momentum in a2. t and p extend canonically to a2  c2n
t  1 and p  1. let us call them once more as t and p . t and p commute
with ~j and hence with j (n ). there is only one way to couple n isospin
1/2s to (2l + 1/2) to get jmax so that (1  j (n ))(1  p )a2n+1 is also of
dimension 2jmax + 1. and t is zero on this subspace.

the projectors (1  j (n ))p(n ) and (1  j (n ))(1  p ) being of the
same rank, there exists a unitary operator u on a2n+1 transforming one to
the other:

(1  j (n ))p(n ) = u(1  j (n ))(1  p )u 1.

(29)

if we transport t by u,

t  = ut u 1,

(30)

then t  = d, f  or  vanishes on (1  j (n ))p(n )a2n+1. on its orthogonal
complement [1  (1  j (n ))p(n )]a2n+1, invariant under t ,  squares to

8

unity and anticommutes with d just as we want. what replaces p now is
not j (n ), but rather

p (n ) = [1  (1  j (n ))p(n )],

p (0) = p.

(31)
(32)

as l  , jmax becomes dominated by 2l and so we have the freedom to

let u approach 1. that is, no u is needed in the continuum limit.

total angular momentum 2l + 1/2 + n/2 has no multiplicity in a2n+1.
as both (1  j (n ))(1  p )a2n+1 and (1  j (n ))p(n )a2n+1 have this angular
momentum, we have that

(1  j (n ))(1  p )a2n+1

= (1  j (n ))p(n )a2n+1

.

so we choose

u = 1 on (1  j (n ))(1  p )a2n+1

.

next in accordance with (29), we set

(33)

(34)

u(1  j (n ))(1  p )a2n+1

= (1  j (n ))p(n )a2n+1

.

(35)

we also demand that

that xes u upto a phase on the subspace (1  j (n ))(1  p )a2n+1.

[u, ji] = 0.

(36)

we saw in [10] that (1  )/2 are projectors for combining ~lr and
~/2 to give angular momenta l  1/2. so  = +1 on all the subspaces
(1j (n ))(1p )a2n+1, (1j (n ))(p(n ))a2n+1. also, (p ~ (i)
2 +1)
on these subspaces. it follows that (34), (35) and (36) are compatible with
a u commuting with ji, , (~lr + ~/2)2 and (p ~ (i)
)2. we now outline an
extension of u to all of a2n+1 consistently with rotational invariance (36)
and

an important consequence is that

 =

(37)

(38)

so that

[, p(n )] = [, ji] = [, j (n )] = 0.

one way to specify u more fully is as follows. let
= x  x  = x   x 

a2n+1

(39)

(40)

be orthogonal decompositions where

x = (1  j (n ))(1  p )a2n+1
x  = ux = (1  j (n ))p(n )a2n+1

 (1  j (n ))(1  p )a2n+1
,
 (1  j (n ))p(n )a2n+1

.

(41)

(42)

both x and x  are invariant under the self-adjoint operators

ji,(cid:18)~lr +

~

2(cid:19)2

2 (cid:19)2
and (cid:18)x ~ (i)

.

therefore, the same is the case with x  and x . we can extend u to a map
x   x  which commutes with the above operators. there would still be
uncertainties about choosing u requiring further conventions for elimination.
although t  are operators on p (n )a2n+1, that is not the space of sections

for the twisted bundles. the latter is, rather,

q(n )a2n+1

= p(n )p (n )a2n+1

= p(n )j (n )a2n+1

.

(43)

it is not an invariant subspace for d unless d is projected, or corrected
by connections as explained in [13] . however, chirality  is well-dened on
twisted sections because of (39).

we now permanently rename t , p (n ) and q(n ) as follows:

d,   d,  , p(n )  p,
p (n )  p , q(n )  q.

(44)

 in any case is .

this completes our construction of dirac operator and chirality on s2

we may remark here that the algebra for the space s2
f s2
its dirac and chirality operators are d1 + d and  .
