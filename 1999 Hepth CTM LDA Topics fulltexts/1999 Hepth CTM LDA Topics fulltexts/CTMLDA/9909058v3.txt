abstract

we address a supersymmetric embedding of domain walls with asymptotically
anti-desitter (ads) space-times in ve-dimensional simple, n=2 u(1) gauged su-
pergravity theory constructed by gunaydin, townsend and sierra. these confor-
mally at solutions interpolate between supersymmetric ads vacua, satisfy the
killing spinor (rst order) dierential equations, and the four-dimensional world
on the domain wall is a at world with n=1 supersymmetry. regular solution
in this class have the energy density related to the cosmological constants of the
supersymmetric ads vacua. an analysis of such solutions is given for the exam-
ple of one (real, neutral) vector supermultiplet with the most general form of the
prepotential. there are at most two supersymmetric ads vacua that are in gen-
eral separated by a singularity in the potential. nevertheless the supersymmetric
domain wall solution exists with the scalar eld interpolating continuously across
the singular region.

1 introduction

the past few months have witnessed exciting progress in the study of domain walls in
d=5 gravity theories. such congurations are interesting from two, on a surface or-
thogonal perspectives: (i) in the context of ads/cft correspondence such conformally
at congurations provide new insights in the study of rge ows [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
and (ii) in the context of phenomenological implications, such congurations provide
a framework [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19] to address the physics implications
of large dimensions for the four-dimensional world on the domain wall.

within the rst approach a number of conformally at solutions were constructed
and in particular the ones interpolating between supersymmetric anti-desitter (ads)
vacua of n=8 d=5 gauged theory provide examples of static domain walls in d=5
with implications for the renormalization group ow and spectra in strongly coupled
four-dimensional super yang-mills theories. one such example [2, 5] involves two scalar
elds and thus was solved numerically and another most recent example with one scalar
eld can be solved explicitly [20].

within the second approach innitely thin, static, z2-symmetric domain wall solutions
were constructed [11, 12] for pure ads gravity theory. (generalizations that incorpo-
rate eects of additional compactied dimensions were given in [13, 15, 16].) these
solutions have to satisfy a specic relation between the domain wall tension  and the
cosmological constant  of the ads vacua, thus implying a ne-tuning.

the purpose of this letter is few-fold. we shall address a supersymmetric embedding of
domain walls with asymptotically ads space-times in ve-dimensions, in the simplest
supergravity theory, i.e. the supergravity theory with least supersymmetry that allows
for the explicit constructions of supersymmetric domain wall congurations. in order
to demonstrate the existence of such domain walls, a supergravity theory necessarily
has to have a potential for (gauge neutral) scalar elds, and the only known such
examples are gauged supergravity theories and the matter elds responsible for the
formation of the domain wall belongs to vector-supermultiplets. we thus choose to work
within a framework of a ve-dimensional n=2, u(1) gauged supergravity formulated
by gunaydin, townsend and sierra [21] 3.
we derive the killing spinor equations for domain wall solutions. for regular solutions
in this class we also derive that the energy density  of the wall is related in a specic
way to the cosmological constants of the supersymmetric vacua on each side of the
wall. namely, the relationship between the domain wall tension and the cosmological
constant for regular supersymmetric domain walls is a consequence of the bps nature
of the solution, and not an artifact of ne-tuning 4. these congurations have four

3such a theory may have its origin as a compactication of type iib superstring theory on a specic
einstein-sasaki-5-manifolds or as a compactication of m-theory on calabi-yau with non-trivial uxes
turned on. but the details are unknown so far and remain to be worked out.

4these properties are very much parallel to those of supersymmetric domain walls of four-

dimensional n=1 supergravity theory found in [23] and reviewed in [24].

unbroken supercharges, or in other words break 1
2 of n=2, d=5 supersymmetry, and
thus the four-dimensional world on the domain wall has n=1 supersymmetry. a special
example of innitely thin supersymmetric domain walls (corresponding to the case of
very large gauge coupling) with z2 symmetry would provide a concrete supersymmetric
realization of the static domain wall solution found by randall and sundrum [11].

for the sake of concreteness we analyse the case with one physical (gauge neutral)
vector supereld which allows for an explicit analysis of the possible domain wall con-
gurations. for this simple model, kink solutions have been discussed some time ago
[22]; the domain walls presented in this paper provide a concrete and explicit realisation
of supersymmetric kink solutions. the upshot of the analysis is that this framework
does provide examples of static domain wall solutions that satisfy the killing spinor
equations and are thus supersymmetric. the general one scalar case, however, has a
potential that has at most two supersymmetric ads vacua which are always separated
by at least one (out of three) singularity points where the potential diverges. never-
theless the scalar for the supersymmetric domain wall solutions interpolates across the
singular point.

2 d=5 n=2 u(1) gauged supergravity

supergravity in d=5 is very restrictive with respect to allowed potentials. the only
allowed potentials come from gauging of isometries and especially interesting are poten-
tials that have no run-away behavior (scalars become asymptotically constant) with
non-trivial isolated extrema. this type of potential allows for the existence of domain
walls with extrema corresponding to the ads vacua on each side of the wall. the min-
imal gauged supergravity (n=2 gauged supergravity with u(1) gauged r-symmetry),
constructed in [21, 22], provides such a set-up. in this case one can consistently decou-
ple the hyper-multiplets and the lagrangian contains only the supergravity multiplet
and the vector supermultiplets. (there are also domain wall solutions, that couple to
non-trivial hypermultiplets [17], but they do not have asymptotic anti-de sitter spaces.)
in this case the bosonic lagrangian reads:

we chose the convention where the ve-dimensional newtons constant is  = 1 and g
is the gauge coupling. we work in the (, +, +, +, +) convention. the physical scalars
a, which are real and neutral, correspond to the scalar components of the vector
super-multiplets and dene coordinates of the manifold dened by [21]

notice, w is subject to the constraint (2) which makes it non-linear in the physical
scalars a.

supersymmetry transformations and bps-saturated domain
walls

we are searching for supersymmetric (bps-saturated) domain wall solutions: those are
solutions that preserve part of the supersymmetry, and thus satisfy the killing spinor
equations, which are rst order dierential equations what ensure that the supersym-
metry transformations in this domain wall background are preserved.

we choose these domain wall solutions to be neutral, and thus they are supported only
by (gauge neutral) scalars with the gauge elds turned o. thus, the supersymmetry
transformations for these backgounds read [21]:

a = (cid:16)  i

(6)

the vacuum is given by the asymptotic space, where the scalars are constant and
thus supersymmetry requires aw = 0. the form of the potential v (4) implies that
supersymmetric vacua are always extrema of the potential.

the domain wall ansatz for the metric is of the form:

(7)
5note the parallels with the potential in d=4 n=1 supergravity where: v = ek(cid:16)ga bdaw dbw 

ds2 = a(z)h  dt2 + dx2

3i + dz2 ,

1 + dx2

2 + dx2

4

and the scalars have the form a = a(z), where z = {, +} is a direction
transverse to the wall.
then the killing spinor equations  = 0 and a = 0 are solved by 6:

z log a = 2gw ,

(8)

and

za = 3ggabbw ,

(9)
where the four component spinor satises the constraint: z = . (killing spinor
equations for domain walls of d=5, n=8 supergravity can be cast in a similar form [5].)
note that as long as the domain of physical elds contain two isolated supersymmetric
vacua, this set of solutions specify the bps domain wall. the physical domain of such
solutions requires that the scalar metric gab remains positive denite.
the domain wall tension can be determined by applying nesters procedure which
relates the wall tension  to the central charge of the supersymmetry algebra; the
central charge is determined by the values of the superpotential at each asymptotically
supersymmetric vacuum. (for d=4 n=1 domain wall solutions, see appendix a of
[23].) more concretely, one considers the integral over the spatial boundary

 is a space-like hypersurface and thus d0  dzd~x. the nester tensor reads n  =
 where  is the gravitino variation. in (10) we used the stokes theorem,
and thus assumed that the nester tensor is non-singular. in order to determine the
energy density, we can factor out the integral over the domain wall coordinates (d~x)
and the integration over the transverse direction (z) yields in (10) the contributions
far away from the wall.
inserting the gravitino variation in (10), one obtains two
contributions, the rst one represents the domain wall tension  (energy density) and
the second one corresponds to the central charge c. the latter one is a topological
term that corresponds to the dierence of the boundary values of the superpotential.
for the supersymmetric conguration the gravitino variation is zero, and thus (10) is
zero which implies:

where we used the projector z = . in the killing spinor equations and in (11) we
chose w (a|z=+)  w (a|z=). (the reversal of this inequality implies the change
of signs in the killing spinor equations, (11) and z = .) again, in the derivation
of (11) it was assumed that the stokes theorem can be applied and thus the z w is
non-singular inside the wall. in the one-scalar example this is not the case (see later).

where w  w (a|z=). in the second part of (12) we have used the relationship
between the cosmological constant  and the value of the superpotential w for super-
symmetric vacua. note that  is determined by sign[w+w]. thus, the domain
wall tension is specied by the values of the cosmological constants of the asymptotic
ads vacua.

according to the asymptotic bahavior of the killing spinor equation (8) there are three
types of bps-saturated domain walls (very much parallel to the analysis of the types
of bps-saturated domain walls in d=4 [26], their global space-time structure [27] and
their relationship to non-supersymmetric congurations [28]):

 type i domain walls interpolate supersymmetric minkowski space-time ( =
0) and the ads space time (+   6= 0). on the asymptotic ads side the
metric coecient takes the form a(z) = e 2
3  z; on the ads side of the wall
z   limit corresponds to the ads horizon. the geodesic extension of these
space-times could either be pure ads or new regions that involve an innite tiling
. these

walls saturate an analog of the coleman-de luccia bound [29] in ve dimensions.

126

 type ii domain walls interpolate between supersymmetric ads vacua where
sign[w] = sign[w+] and the asymptotic metric behaves as a(z) = e 2
on each side of the wall z   limits correspond to the ads horizons and
thus the geodesic extensions could be either pure ads or new regions that com-
prise of an innite tiling with the mirror domain walls. for regular solutions

the ads vacua [25]. a special case of a z2 symmetric solution (w+ = w)
satises the constraint: bp s = 1

 which is a relationship found in [11].

 type iii domain walls are those between two supersymmetric ads vacua where
sign[w] = +sign[w+]. the metric coecient grows exponentially on one
side of the wall: a(z) = e+min[ 2

corresponds to the boundary of the ads space! for regular solutions bp s =

non-supersymmetric generalizations corresponds to false vacuum decay bubbles,

dening the physical scalar as  = x 1/x 0 the constraint (2) takes the form:

3 g w|extr (see
e.g., [6]). this relationship implies that for physical solutions with g > 0 the two
extrema of w cannot be connected, there is at least one pole between them. thus,
the supersymmetric domain wall solution necessarily involves a jump over a region
where the superpotential (as well as the scalar metric and the potential) has a pole.
note, these lines of arguments hold for the one-scalar case, only. if w depends on more
than one scalar, it may allow for two minima, which can be smoothly connected.

w|extr = 2

in order to discuss the solution in more detail we choose, without loss of generality,
the following parameterization:

g = 1,

a = 0 , b = d = h0 = 1 , c = 3 ,

h1 = 3 .

(18)

(one can show that g = d = h0 = 1 corresponds to an overall rescaling of the
potential, a = 0 can be obtained by shifts     0 and h0  h0 + h10, and b = 1
corresponds to a rescaling of .) in this case the metric, superpotential and its derivate

the corresponding killing spinor equations for the metric coecient a(z) is given in
(8) and that for the scalar eld (9) takes the form:

(22)

let us mention that in a proper coordinate system, these rst order dierential equa-
tions are solved by an algebraic constraint [6], which says that the normal vector on
the scalar manifold, dened by (13), has to behave monotonically and becomes parallel
to hi in the asymptotic ads vacuum.

features of the solutions and an example

the rst useful observation is that in the region where the metric g has real poles,
g has no real zeroes. namely, the poles and zeros are at the following values of :

poles of g : { 1

2(3  32  4), 0} ,

zeroes for g :   32 + 4
23(2  1)

.

(23)

(24)

thus for 2 > 4/3 there are no zeroes of the metric, but there are poles for the values
of  specied by (23).

supersymmetric vacua are determined by zeroes of w (21). as discussed at the
beginning of this section, there are at most two, where  takes the value:

zeroes for w :

(  )  2   + 2  1

3(  1)

.

(25)

note also that the poles of w , w and g are identical.
for the parameter range 2 < 4
3, w has no poles and thus, due to the relationship
w|extr = 2
2
3 g w|extr, one extremum has to be a maximum and the other one a mini-
mum. therefore, the scalar metric g is negative for one value of (25) and corresponds
to a non-physical vacuum ( becomes tachyonic).
thus the only physical region for the domain wall solutions corresponds to 2 > 4
3. now
the scalar metric g is always positive denite and w has two real extrema which are
necessarily separated by at least one pole. thus these domain walls interpolate between
supersymmetric extrema with the kink () solution transversing a region where the
potential (the superpotential and the metric) have a pole. near the pole the killing

typically one encounters type ii domain wall solutions, i.e. sign[w+] = sign[w],
and at least one pole in-between. (further details will be given elsewhere [25].) for
the sake of concreteness we exhibit a numerical solution for  = 1.4,  = 0.6 with the
two supersymmetric minima (25) at {1.0887,0.1664} sandwiched between the pole
in the middle (poles (23) are at {1.8980,0.5269, 0}). this solution is close to a z2
symmetric solution; w| = 2.6944 and w|+ = 2.4953. notice the slow-down
of the kink solution (z) and a power-law spike of the metric a(z) in the middle of
the wall. moreover, the smoothness of the scalar is due to the denition as ratio, x 0
as well as x 1 are singular at the pole (recall  = x 1/x 0).

7we thank r. myers for pointing that to us.

4 conclusions

the specic realization of supersymmetric domain walls with asymptotically ads
space-times, in the simplest ve-dimensional supergravity, demonstrates a number of
interesting features. the superpotential w as a function of a single scalar can have
at most two extrema, but there is no smooth ow possible while demanding that the
scalar metric remains positive (g > 0). two ads vacua with positive scalar metric
have to be separated by a pole in the superpotential and the corresponding domain
wall represents a supergravity solution that interpolates between the two branches. de-
spite this singularity, a stable kink solution exists with the scalar eld slowing-down
mildly in the region crossing the pole.

within a more general framework of ve-dimensional n=2 u(1) gauged supergravity
we derived the killing spinor equations for static domain wall solutions with asymptotic
ads space-times. for regular solutions in this class the wall tension and the cosmo-
logical constants of the supersymmetric ads vacua are related. such a relationship is
therefore a consequence of the supersymmetry and not an artifact of ne-tuning. as
another by-product we see that the domain wall world is at and supersymmetric, i.e.
along with the massless graviton there is an accompanying gravitino. the hypermulti-
plets of d=5 gauged supergravity could potentially play a role of matter on the domain
wall, a subject of further investigations. the break-down of supersymmetry (by either
of the vacua) would ensure that the non-extreme walls would become expanding bub-
bles (see the analysis given in for non-supersymmetric domain walls in d=4 in [28] and
for a somewhat related analysis in d=5 in [19, 30, 31].)
