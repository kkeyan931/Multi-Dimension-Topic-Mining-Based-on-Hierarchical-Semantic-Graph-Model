abstract

we give a detailed operator product expansion interpretation of the results for confor-
mal 4point functions computed from supergravity through the ads/cft duality. we show
that for an arbitrary scalar exchange in adsd+1 all the powersingular terms in the direct
channel limit (and only these terms) exactly match the corresponding contributions to the
ope of the operator dual to the exchanged bulk eld and of its conformal descendents. the
leading logarithmic singularities in the 4point functions of protected n = 4 superyang
mills operators (computed from iib supergravity on ads5  s5) are interpreted as o( 1
n 2 )
renormalization effects of the doubletrace products appearing in the ope. applied to the
4point functions of the operators o  (trf 2 + . . .) and oc  (trf f + . . .), this analysis
leads to the prediction that the doubletrace composites [ooc] and [ooococ ] have
anomalous dimension  16
y m n limit. we describe a geometric pic-
ture of the ope in the dual gravitational theory, for both the powersingular terms and the
leading logarithms. we comment on several possible extensions of our results.

1 introduction

the study of 4dimensional conformal field theories is an old and important topic. the
ads/cft correspondence [1, 2] provides new powerful tools to address this problem. difcult
dynamical questions about the strong coupling behavior of the cft are answered by perturbative
computations in anti de sitter supergravity. a natural set of questions concerns the nature of the
operator product expansion of the cft at strong coupling. thanks to the ads/cft duality, we
can now answer some of these questions.

the prime example of an exactly conformal 4dimensional eld theory, namely the n = 4
superyang mills theory with gauge group su(n), is dual [1] to type iib string theory on
2 . for
ads5  s5, with n units of 5form ux and compactication radius r2 = (g2
y m n the dual string theory is approximated by
large n and large t hooft coupling   g2
weakly coupled supergravity in ads5 background. since the 5dimensional newton constant
g5  r3/n 2, the perturbative expansion in supergravity corresponds to the 1/n expansion in
the cft. correlation functions of local operators of the cft belonging to short multiplets of the
superconformal algebra are given for n  ,    by supergravity amplitudes according to
the prescription of [4, 5]. while the supergravity results for 2 and 3point functions of chiral
operators [6][9] have been found to agree with the free eld approximation, giving strong
evidence for the existence of nonrenormalization theorems [10][12], 4point functions [13]
[26] certainly contain some nontrivial dynamical information1.

the 4point functions of the operators o and oc dual to the dilaton and axion elds were
obtained in [22] through a supergravity computation, and expressed as very explicit series ex-
pansions in terms of two conformal invariant variables. the fundamental elds of the n = 4
theory are the gauge boson a, 4 majorana fermions a and 6 real scalars x i, all in the adjoint
representation of the gauge group su(n). the operators o and oc are the exactly marginal
operators that correspond to changing the gauge coupling and the theta angle of the theory. in
other terms the sym lagrangian has the form l  1

besides these complete dilatonaxion 4point functions, explicit results for arbitrary super-
gravity exchange diagrams involving massive scalars, massive vectors and massless gravitons are
also available [23]. in the present paper we give a detailed ope interpretation of some of these
results, and obtain new predictions for the strong coupling behavior of the n = 4 sym theory.
the fact that the 5d supergravity amplitudes can be consistently interpreted in terms of a 4d local
ope is by itself quite remarkable, and constitutes a strong test of the ads/cft duality.

let us introduce the main issues from the eld theory viewpoint. by considering the limit
of a 4point function as the operator locations become pairwise close (take a tchannel limit
x13  |~x1  ~x3|  0 and x24  |~x2  ~x4|  0), we expect a double ope expansion to hold:

ho1(~x1)o2(~x2)o3(~x3)o4(~x4)i = xn,m

n hon(~x1)om(~x2)i m

(x13)1+3m(x24)2+4n

,

(1.2)

at least as an asymptotic series, and hopefully with a nite radius of convergence in x13 and x24.
for simplicity we have suppressed all lorentz and avor structures and generically denoted by
{on} the set of primary operators op and their conformal descendents kop. let us take the
operators in the 4point function to be singletrace2 chiral primaries tr(x (i1 . . . x ik)) or any of
their superconformal descendents, such as o  tr(f 2 + . . .). these operators belong to short
representations of the superconformal algebra3 and their dimensions do not receive quantum
corrections. on purely eldtheoretic grounds, we expect that all the operators allowed by
selection rules (most of which are not chiral) can contribute as intermediate states to the r.h.s. of
(1.2).

the ads/cft duality makes the interesting prediction that the nonchiral operators of the

sym theory actually fall into two classes4, which behave very differently at strong coupling:

 operators dual to string states, like for example the konishi operator trx ix i, whose di-

mensions become very large in the strong coupling limit (as  

1

4 );

 multitrace operators obtained by taking (suitably regulated) products of singletrace chi-
ral operators at the same point, like for example the normalordered product [oo].
these operators are dual to multiparticle supergravity states.

2the trace is over the color group su (n ). singletrace operators in sym are dual to singleparticle kaluza

klein states in supergravity [33].

3we will call chiral any operator belonging to a short multiplet.

4group theoretic aspects of string and multiparticle states are considered in [34].

2

since in the limit of large n, large  the dual supergravity description is weakly coupled, the
dimension of a multiparticle state is approximately the sum of the dimensions of the single
particle (singletrace in sym language) constituents, with small corrections of order g5  1/n 2
due to gravitational interactions. from a perturbative analysis in the sym theory it is not hard
to show (see section 4.2) that for large n and small  the anomalous dimension of an operator
n 4 ), where f () can be computed as a perturbative
like [oo] is of the form  1
series f () = pk1 akk. the ads/cft duality then predicts that as    the function f ()

saturates to a nite value.

n 2 f () + o( 1

a nontrivial issue is whether in the double ope intepretation of the supergravity amplitudes
one can nd any remnant of the nonchiral operators corresponding to string states. in fact,
although these operators acquire a large anomalous dimension as   , an innite number
of them is exchanged in the r.h.s. of (1.2) for any nite , and one may worry about a possible
nonuniformity of the limit. on the contrary, our analysis will lend support to the idea that as
   the string states consistently decouple.

since each singletrace chiral operator o of the sym theory is dual to some kaluzaklein
mode  of supergravity, there appears to be a 11 correspondence between supergravity diagrams
in which  is exchanged in the tchannel (that is, the bulktobulk  propagators joins the
pairs o1o3 and o2o4, see fig.1) and the contribution to the double ope (1.2) of the operator
in section 2 we prove a general theorem5: for any
o and its conformal descendents ko.
scalar exchange6 in adsd+1 all the singular terms o( 1
) (and only these terms) exactly match
xn
13
the corresponding contributions of the conformal block {ko} to the double ope (1.2) of
the ddimensional boundary cft. we believe that a similar theorem must hold for exchanges
of arbitrary spin. the correspondence between supergravity exchanges and conformal partial
waves breaks down precisely when the doubletrace operator [o1o3], which has dimension
1 + 3 + o(1/n 2), starts contributing to the ope. this result implies that as    the
singular part of the ope of two chiral sym operators is entirely given by other chiral operators
and their multitrace products. this is of course consistent with the expectation that nonchiral
operators corresponding to string states have a large dimension in this limit.

a generic feature of supergravity 4point amplitudes is that their asymptotic expansions
contain logarithmic terms. for example, a tchannel exchange diagram (fig.1) contains as
x13  0 a logarithmic singularity of the form

x12x34(cid:17), as well as a whole series of

log(cid:16) x13x24

o( 1

13
instead no power singularities, and the logarithmic term is leading.) this logarithmic behavior
may appear puzzling in a unitary cft. however, as stressed to us by witten early in this work,
logs naturally arise in the perturbative expansion of a cft from anomalous dimensions and
operator mixing.

section 3 of the paper is devoted to a general discussion of the logarithmic behavior of
cfts. the difference between logs that arise in a pertubative expansion of a unitary theory and
the intrinsic logs of a nonunitary theory is emphasized. in our case the perturbative parameter
is 1/n. as already noted, we expect operators like [oo] to have anomalous dimensions of
n 2 ). the logs in the supergravity 4point functions arise indeed at the correct order and
order o( 1
n 2 ) renormalization effects of the doubletrace
with the right structure to be interpreted as o( 1
composites produced in the ope of two chiral operators.

in section 4, we perform a careful analysis of the leading logarithmic terms in the super-
gravity correlators hooooi and hoocooci. in order to reproduce the structure of the
supergravity logs it is crucial to take into account the mixing between operators with the same
quantum numbers, like [oo] and [ococ]. this analysis leads to the prediction of the strong
coupling values of the anomalous dimensions of the operators [ooc] and [oo  ococ],
which are the only two operators with the maximal uy (1) charge |y | = 4 and thus cannot mix
with any other operator of approximate dimension 8.

in section 5 we present our conclusions and propose some avenues for future research.

2 supergravity exchanges versus ope: power singularities

there is an intriguing relation [13] [14] between supergravity exchange diagrams and confor-
mal partial waves. a conformal partial wave is the contribution to the double ope represen-
tation (1.2) of a full conformal block, which consists of a given primary operator op and all
its conformal descendents kop. let us take the external operators oi in the l.h.s. of (1.2) to
be singletrace, chiral sym operators and let us consider the partial waves in which the inter-
mediate primaries are also singletrace and chiral. these are the operators which are in 11
correspondence with the singleparticle kaluzaklein states of supergravity. it is then clear that
for each such conformal partial wave one can draw a related supergravity diagram, in which the

dual kk mode is exchanged in the bulk7, see fig.1.

here we wish to compare supergravity scalar exchange diagrams in adsd+1 with conformal
partial waves in ddimensional cfts. we shall nd that for a given partial wave all the singular
terms in the ope are exactly reproduced by the corresponding supergravity exchange. however
the higher order terms are different8.

the conformal partial wave for an intermediate scalar primary is an old result [35, 36]. con-
sider for simplicity the 4point function of scalar operator oi with pairwise equal dimensions

the contribution from an intermediate operator o and its conformal descendents can be written
as (see appendix a for the conversion from the form in [36] to our notations):

7for a given primary op to contribute to the double ope, the 3point functions ho1o3opi and ho2o4opi must
be nonvanishing: this condition translates on the supergravity side to the existence of cubic couplings 13p and
24p.

8this is contrary to the claim in [14] of an exact equivalence between supergravity exchanges and conformal

partial waves, but compatible with the results in [17].

we expect similar results for arbitrary spin exchange. expressions for conformal partial
waves for arbitrary spin can be found for example in [37]. the exchange supergravity diagrams
for vectors of general mass and massless gravitons have been evaluated in [16, 22, 23], where it
was also checked that the leading power singularity reproduced the contribution expected from
ope considerations (see (4.23) of [16] and sec. 2.3 of [22]). it would be interesting to extend
the comparison to all the subleading powersingular singular terms.

this nice holographic behavior of the adsd+1 supergravity exchange diagrams (their power
singularities match the ddimensional conformal ope) can also be understood in the following
heuristic way [13]. the exchange amplitude is given by an integral over the two bulk interaction
points z and w

ric equivalent, on the supergravity side, of the operator product expansion o1(~x1)o3(~x3) 
x13+
o(~x1). it is possible to compute the rst few higherorder corrections to (2.7) and
13
to match them exactly [13] with the singular contributions to the operator product o1o3 of the
descendents ko.

so far we have analyzed the power singularities in the direct channel limit of an exchange
graph, i.e. when we let approach together two operators that join to the same bulk interaction
vertex (x13  0 or x24  0 in (2.5)). a given 4point function is obtained by summing
all the crossedsymmetric exchanges, as well as quartic graphs (diagrams with a single bulk
interaction vertex, equ.(a.5)). thus in analyzing the singular behavior of a 4point correlator
we also need to consider the type of leading singularities that appear in quartic graphs, as well
as in the crossed channel limit of an exchange graph (for example x12  0 in (2.5)). it turns
out that these two cases (crossed exchanges and quartic) have the same qualitative behavior10:
as x12  0, the leading asymptotic is o(
) if 1 + 2  3  4 > 0 or log(x12)
if 1 + 2  3  4 = 0, and the limit is smooth if 1 + 2  3  4 < 0. these are
the singularities expected from the contribution to the operator product o1o2 of the composite
operator [o3o4], which has dimension 3 + 4 in the large n limit.

the results of this section have a clear implication for the n = 4 sym theory: in the limit
of large n, large , the only singular terms in the product of two chiral operators are given by
other chiral operators and their multitrace products (and their rst few conformal descendents).

3.1 general analysis

let us analyze the issue of logarithms in general, for an arbitrary cft, before returning to the
case of the n = 4 supersymmetric yangmills in 4 dimensions. a cft is characterized by
the absence of any inherent length scale. under quite general conditions one can argue that
for primary operators of the conformal algebra the 2point function is forced by conformal
invariance to have the form

ho(x1)o(x2)i =

c

|x1  x2|2

(3.1)

the power law on the r.h.s. is covariant under scale transformations: if we write x = x, then
the 2point function will be left unchanged provided we also change the operators from o to
o = o.

one might imagine that a logarithmic dependence log |x1x2|

l would violate conformal in-
variance of the theory, since a length scale l is needed to make the argument of the logarithm
dimensionless. there exists however a class of 2d theories called logarithmic cfts, where log-
arithms do arise. these theories will not be the focus of our interest later on, so we mention
them now and then exclude them from the rest of the discussion below. in logarithmic cfts the
dilation operator cannot be diagonalised, but (in the simplest case) has a jordan form instead on
a pair of operators o, o. the 2point functions are of the form

ho(z1)o(z2)i = 0
h o(z1)o(z2)i =
h o(z1) o(z2)i =

1

1

(z1  z2)2
(z1  z2)2 log

(3.2)

z1  z2

y

(in the above we have considered only the holomorphic parts of the operators.) under a dilation
z = z we must not only rescale the elds but also implement a shift transformation: o =
o, o = [ o + 1
2 log()o]. with this change of variables the correlators of the rescaled
theory become identical to the original ones, and so the parameter y in (3.3) does not represent
a fundamental length in the theory, but instead describes a certain choice for the operator o from
the subspace of operators o, o of the same dimension.

these logarithmic cfts are however not expected to be unitary. in a radial quantization the
dilation operator is the hamiltonian. in 2d cfts the eigenvalues of the dilation operator on
the plane map to the eigenvalues of the time translation operator on the cylinder, so in a unitary
theory we expect that the dilation operator will be diagonalisable and will not have a nontrivial
jordan form. our case of interest (the 4d n = 4 supersymmetric yang-mills theory) is a unitary

9

theory, and we will assume in what follows that the dilation operator is diagonalisable on the
space of elds. the analysis of the next section will conrm this assumption.

for unitary cfts the 3point function of primary elds also has a standard form which is

xed by conformal invariance

where ij = i + j, ij = i  j. one might imagine that the expansion of f in say 
would in general contain a logarithm:

f (, ) = . . . + f1()1 + f0() + f0() log  + f1() + . . .

(3.6)

so that the x1  x2 limit of the 4-point function would contain a logarithmic term  log x12.
but consider evaluating the 4point function using the ope:

o1(x1)o2(x2) = xp op(x2)xp12
o3(x3)o4(x4) = xq oq(x4)xq34

12

34

ho1(x1)o2(x2)o3(x3)o4(x4)i = xp,q hop(x2)oq(x4)ixp12

12

(3.7)

xq34
34

we have written the functions arising in the ope in symbolic form: the operators op will in
general carry tensor indices and these can contract with the unit vector along x1  x2. but
the basic point that we wish to observe is the following. if op is a conformal primary, then
the coefcient function appearing in the ope of o1 and o2 can be deduced from the 3point
function (3.3), and contains no logarithm. if op is a conformal descendant, then the coefcient
function will be obtained as derivatives of the coefcient function for the corresponding primary,
and so again there will be no logarithm in these functions. similar arguments yield that if
the 2-point functions of primaries contain no logarithms, then nor do the two point functions
hop(x2)oq(x4)i appearing in the last line of the above equation.

10

thus if the ope sums in (3.7) converge, we conclude that the 4point function does not in
fact have a logarithm in x12 in an expansion around x12 = 0. in unitary 2d cfts such ope
sums do yield the correct 4point functions, and logarithms do not arise in the short distance
expansions.

let us now consider the circumstances where we will encounter logarithms in our analysis of
cft correlation functions. suppose that we study a 1parameter family of cfts; let us denote
this parameter by a. suppose that the theory at a particular value of the parameter, say zero,
is particularly simple. then we may ask for the npoint correlation functions in a series in the
parameter around zero. the example that we are concerned with is of course n = 4 su(n)
sym, where the theory for 1/n  0 is expected to be simple11, and the correlators may be
studied in a series in 1/n. consider rst the 2point function (3.1). let

here we have introduced a length scale l to be able to write the logarithms in dimensionless
form: l may be chosen in an arbitrary way since it just denes the normalisation of the operators,
and is needed because the operators o have at a generic value of a a dimension that is different
from the one at a = 0.

thus we see that the leading correction to the 2point function at nonzero a has a logarithm in
x12, with a coefcient that depends in the manner shown on the correction (1) to the dimension
at nonzero a. such a correction will of course be absent if the dimensions of the operators do
not change with a. thus in particular for our case of interest, the two point functions of sym
chiral operators will not have such a logarithmic correction. but we can consider composite
operators made from two chiral operators, and such operators will in general have a logarithm
in their 2point function. we will compute the 4point function of four chiral operators; if we
then take the limit x12  0, x34  0, then we can extract the 2point function of the nonchiral
composites, and observe the logarithmic correction.

11we are actually interested in the double limit n  ,   . since in the supergravity analysis there is no
remnant of the  dependence, while the 1/n expansion coincides with the perturbative expansion in powers of the
newton constant, g5  1/n 2, we restrict here to the n dependence alone.

now consider the 3point function. suppose for simplicity that the operators o1 and o2
have dimensions that are protected (i.e. unchanged under variations of the parameter a). let the
dimension of o3 be 3 = (0) + (1). then we have

as mentioned above, what we will do is compute a 4point function of chiral oprators, and the
composite operator appearing in the above equation will be obtained in a limit where two of the
chiral insertions are taken to approach each other.

in the above we have considered the case of operators that change by a multiplicative factor
under scale transformations. in a unitary cft we can always nd a basis of operators where the
action of the dilation operator is thus diagonalised. but if we are considering a one parameter
family of theories, then operators which are dilation eigenstates at say a = 0 will not generically
be such in the theory with a 6= 0. we will be interested in computing only the leading order
correction to the dimensions, so we can neglect mixing among operators that have different
dimensions at a = 0 (this is a familiar story, for example from ordinary quantum mechanics
perturbation theory), and we need to consider only mixing among operators which are degenerate
at zeroth order. let us consider the logarithms arising at the rst order in correction away from
a = 0, in the case where there are two or more degenerate operators at a = 0.

at this point for clarity of the discussion we specialize to the case of the theory that we
are going to study  the n = 4 supersymmetric su(n) yang-mills theory, studied in a 1/n
expansion around the large n limit.

let oi be singletrace chiral operators (i.e., chiral primaries trx (i1    x ik) or any of their
supersymmetry descendents). superconformal symmetry xes their scaling dimension to a value
independent of n. recall that these operators are a small subset of all the operators that are
primaries of the conformal algebra. we take the oi to be normalized such that

oi(x)oj(0) =

ij
|x|2i

(3.12)

we now construct the doubletrace composite operators made from pairs of these primaries. let
oij be given through

[oii(x)]y 

1
2oi(x + y)oi(x)  subtractions

[oij(x)]y  oi(x + y)oj(x)  subtractions, (i 6= j)

(3.13)

(3.14)

12

to dene these composite operators we pointsplit the two chiral constituents by a distance y and
subtract the powersingular contributions in their ope. in the supergravity limit of n   and
 large the singular part of the ope of two singletrace chiral operators o1 and o2 is given by
n ))
other singletrace chiral operators with dimension  < 1+2 (with an ope coefcient o( 1
and by doubletrace composites [o3o4] with 3 + 4 < 1 + 2 (with an ope coefcient
n 2 )). these statements follow from standard large n counting rules and from the input of
o( 1
the ads/cft duality (conrmed by the analysis of section 2) that nonchiral operators dual to
string states have a large anomalous dimension in this limit.

let us denote the composite indices {ij} by ,  . . .. also, to simplify the notation we will
usually drop the explicit dependence on the cutoff distance y and simply indicate the double
trace composites by o. since the dimensions of the chiral operators are integral, there are
clearly several composites for which the sum of the dimensions of the chiral constituents equals
the same value. for n   all these operators will have the same dimension. let us consider
the subspace of composites {o} that have the same dimension  in the large n limit,  =
i + j =  for all . at 1/n = 0 the 2point function of the composites is obviously

ho(x)o(0)i =


|x|2

(3.15)

in the above we have assumed that y  x.

for 1/n small but nonzero, these composites will mix among each other under scale tran-

formations. the innitesimal dilation operator is simply y d

dy , so we have

y

d
dyo = mo

(3.16)

it will be apparent from the supergravity analysis of the next section that m is a real symmetric
matrix, as expected in a unitary theory. we can then nd the dilation eigenstates and their
anomalous dimensions by solving the eigenvalue problem for m. let the eigenvectors of the
dilation y d

dy be the operators o(a)

o(a) = v 

(a)o; o = v (a)
d
dyo(a) = (a)o(a) .

posites with a different cutoff y by a simple rescaling

[o(a)]y =   y

(3.23)

from the supergravity results (or from eldtheory large n counting) we have that (a) =

ho(a)(x)o(b)(0)ia = |y|2(a)

thus from the knowledge of the leading logarithmic term in the 4point functions of chiral
operators we can directly extract the mixing matrix m of the doubletrace composites, and
by solving the eigenvalue problem we can then nd the dilation eigenstates and their anomalous
dimensions. observe that for  = , i.e. when the chiral constituents are pairwise equal (say
n 2 ) correction to the leading
i = k, j = l) the logarithmic term in (3.25) appears as a o( 1

14

power behavior, which is of order o(1) in the large n counting and is given in (3.26) by the
disconnected contribution to the 4point function (obtained by simply contracting the equal
chiral operators). however for  6= , i.e. in the case of mixing between different composites,
the log naturally appears to order o( 1

n 2 ) without a o(1) power term.

let us nally relate this discussion to the operator product expansion. from the very de-

nition of the composite doubletrace operators, we have

oi(x)oj(0)  singular terms + [o(0)]x ,  = (ij)

we can rewrite

(3.28)

[o(a)]x = v (a)

where in the last step we have used the orthogonality of the matrix v and the relation (3.21).
thus to order o( 1

n 2 ) the ope takes the form

oi(x)oj(0)  singular terms + [o(0)]y + m log(x/y) [o(0))]y ,  = (ij)

(3.30)

this equation translates in the ope language the renormalization and mixing of the double
trace composites. this is the form of the ope required by compatibility with the action of the
dilation operator. in fact, the l.h.s. of the above ope is clearly independent from the scale y,

3.2 logarithms in the supergravity picture

the ads/cft correspondence provides an interesting dual picture of the yang-mills theory, and
in this dual picture we have a simple and elegant pictorial way of seeing the appearance of the
above logarithms. consider a 4point function ho(x1)o(x2)o(x3)o(x4)i. at 1/n = 0, the
supergravity theory is free, and the 4point function factorizes into the product of the 2point
n 2 ), we get contribu-
functions obtained by pairwise contractions of the operators. at order o( 1

as for example fig.1) or quartic graphs with a single interaction vertex, as in fig.3. these con-
nected graphs include logarithmic corrections to the correlator, which represent corrections to
the composite operators generated by the approach of two chiral primaries. to see that the log-
arithm indeed arises from the vicinity of the composite operator in the supergravity diagram,

we look at a typical term that arises in the supergravity description. consider for simplicity the
quartic graph, fig.3. the ads space is represented as the upper half space in fig.4. the quartic
vertex is at a location z, which must be integrated over. in fig.4 we have partitioned the domain
of integration of z into annular regions, each of which is e times in diameter compared to the
one nested inside it. the integration has the form (take for simplicity all conformal dimensions
to be equal)

let x1, x2 be close to the point x = 0, and consider the region of integration where z ap-
proaches z = 0 as well. the points x3, x4 are assumed to be far away from this region. then we
may approximate

general integrals we will have terms with singular powers in x12 as well12. further the exchange
graphs like that in fig.1 have two vertices z, w that are integrated over, and a contribution
log |x12| can arise when one or both of these vertices are in the vicinity of x1, x2.

4 dilatonaxion four point functions and anomalous di-

mensions

in this section we will consider the supergravity results [22] for 4point functions of the sym
operators o, oc dual to the dilaton and axion elds. following the logic of the previous section,
n 2 ) anomalous dimensions and mixings of the operators
we can extract information about the o( 1
occurring in the ope of o and oc by looking at the logarithmic behavior of the correlators.

the expressions for the 4point functions of normalized operators (see (c.5)), for  
 and up to order o( 1
n 2 ), are summarized in appendix c, equations (c.7) and (c.11). the
disconnected graphs give some trivial powers of the separation, of order o(1) in the large n
counting, while the connected treelevel supergravity graphs provide o( 1
n 2 ) contributions which
are nontrivial functions of the crossratios. the leading logarithmic asymptotics are given in
(c.24c.26). they have the structure expected from the contribution to the ope of doubletrace
composites of dimensions 8 + o( 1

n 2 ).

let us rst discuss the simplest case, the schannel limit (i.e., x12  0, x34  0) of the
correlator h o(x1) oc(x2) o(x3) oc(x4)i. in this limit there are no power singularities and the

logarithmic term in (c.26) is the leading contribution. thus from (c.11c.12) and (c.26) we
obtain one of the leading coefcient functions of the ope of o and oc
o(x1) oc(x2) = ac(x12, y)[ o oc]y(x2) +   

(4.1)

here, [ o oc]y is the composite (doubletrace) operator dened by the above equation with ac
given to order o( 1

n 2 ) and for    by

ac(x12, y) = 1 +

a

y ! .
n 2 ln  x12

(4.2)

the numerical constant a is readily determined from the logarithmic asymptotics as x12  0 of
h o oc o oci given by (c.26):

(4.3)

a = 16 .

the above leading behavior of the coefcient function receives corrections both in inverse pow-
ers of  and in the 1
n expansion. for example, treelevel stringy corrections, of order o(3)
n 23/2 ) contribution. the rst quantum
with respect to the einsteinhilbert action, give a o(
corrections (one loop in supergravity) are of order o( 1
n 4 ).

next, from the tchannel limit (x13  0, x24  0) of the same correlation function
h o oc o oci, as well as of the correlators h o o o oi and h oc oc oc oci, we can extract
terms in the ope of two os and two ocs. we expect on general grounds that the ope will
assume the schematic form

we have suppressed for the sake of brevity the dependence of the coefcient functions upon the
positions xi, and the lorentz structures in the stressenergy tensor terms. unlike the o oc ope,
here there are some powersingular terms, arising from the contributions of the stressenergy
tensor and its rst descendents. we discussed these terms in section 2, where we checked that the
singular powers of the direct channel supergravity exchange graph (in this case, the tchannel
graviton exchange) exactly match the predictions of the ope13.

let us then analyze the contributions to the above opes of the doubletrace composites.
clearly, the correlator h o oc o oci determines the coefcient functions cc = cc, while

13here we have a tensor rather than a scalar exchange, but we expect a completely analogous result.

18

h o o o oi determines c and h oc oc oc oci determines ccc. since h o o o oi =

(4.8)

now, it is clear from the above opes and identication of the coefcient functions that we
lack some information on the data for operators in the ope whose dimension is approximately 8.
for example, to compute cct and ct would require knowledge of correlators htt ooi
and htt ococi, which are not at present available. the correlator ht t t ti, which is even
more out of reach, would also be necessary. in order to extract the dilation eigenstates and their
anomalous dimensions, we would need to compute the full mixing matrix of the operators of di-
mension approximately 8 in the large n, large  limit. there are actually several such operators
that we omitted when writing down the opes above. the reason is that many more operators of
dimension 8 in the freeeld approximation may be constructed by taking the product of confor-
mal descendants, such as [jj] = [o(3)
0 ], or even products of fermion operators. clearly,
obtaining the full mixing matrix is possible but very involved, since it would require computing
several 4point functions in supergravity.

0 o(3)

fortunately, using the invariance of the theory under the uy (1) symmetry in the supergravity
limit, it is possible to disentangle the ope and isolate some operators that mix in a simple way.
this is done in the next section.

4.1 the use of u (1)y symmetry and anomalous dimensions

the automorphism group u(1)y of the conformal n = 4 supersymmetry algebra provides a
very useful tool in the organization of the operators and correlation functions in supergravity.
uy (1) transformations are not symmetries of the full iib string theory, nor of the n = 4 sym
theory. however this symmetry is recovered in the supergravity limit, and hence the ads/cft

14the constant c is a half of the coefcient in (c.24) because there are 2 possible wick contractions of the
composite [ o o](x3) generated in the ope (4.4) with the two remaining operators o(x2) and o(x4).

from the table, it is clear that the composite operator

(4.9)

has maximal hypercharge y = 2 amongst the chiral operators. in fact, it is the only singletrace
operator with this maximal hypercharge value. by the same token, the operator [obob] is the
only double trace operator with the maximal hypercharge of y = 4. for example, the stress
tensor has y = 0 and thus [t t ] has vanishing y as well.

as supergravity has exact u(1)y symmetry, this guarantees that the operator [obob] does
not mix in the limit of large n and large  with any other operator at all, and that its anomalous
dimension can be read off from only the correlators already computed above. we must also
expect that the real and imaginary components of [obob], which are [oo  ococ] and
[ooc], have the same anomalous dimension. this is indeed realized in the above correlation
functions.

as already explained, the space of operators of approximate dimension 8 is much bigger than this

this 2  2 matrix of eigenvalue (b + c)/n 2, has maximal uy (1) charge |y | = 4 and we can

y m n on the n = 4
sym side. as the only window to date into large t hooft coupling is via the maldacena conjec-
ture, we do not have any direct checks available for the values of the anomalous dimensions or
for the spacetime dependence of the correlation functions from sym. however, it is very illu-
minating to reproduce the 1/n 2 dependence of the anomalous dimension from the standard large
n counting rules of eld theory, and to investigate any other consequences this may produce.
we proceed by expanding n = 4 sym in 1/n, while keeping the t hooft coupling  xed and
perturbatively small. the strategy will be to isolate the general structure of the expansion, then
to seek the limit where    and compare with supergravity predictions.

by way of example, we concentrate on the hoocooci correlator, but the results apply
generally. first, we normalize the individual operators via their 2point functions, as in (c.5).
to leading order in 1/n, this requires (up to numerical coefcients we do not keep track of)

o =

1
n

trf f +   

22

(4.14)

oc =

n

trf f +   

(4.15)

to born approximation, this normalization is easily obtained by inspection of fig.5 : each oper-
ator has a 1/n normalization factor, and there are two color loops, producing each a factor of n.
according to general nonrenormalization results, the 2point function is actually independent
of gy m and thus independent of the t hooft coupling.

with this normalization, the disconnected graph in fig.6 (a) contributes precisely to order
n 0. the simplest connected born graph (b) of fig.6 has a factor of 1/n 4 from the normalizations
of the 4 operators, and two color loops, so its net contribution is of order 1/n 2, as expected.
finally, in graph (c) of fig.6, we illustrate the higher order perturbative contributions with a
graph of order g6
y m . with a factor 1/n 4 from operator normalization, and 5 color loops, its total
y m n = 3/n 2. thus, for xed t hooft coupling, the ndependence of graphs
dependence is g6
(b) and (c) are the same, as expected. in fact, all planar graphs have this same ndependence
to leading order in n for xed t hooft coupling, and we thus expect the connected part of the
correlator to behave as

h oc o oc oi 

1
n 2 f ()

(4.16)

(4.17)

for some function f of the t hooft coupling and position variables.

the above result was established perturbatively in the t hooft coupling. to compare with
supergravity results, f ought to have a nite limit as   . the maldacena conjecture predicts
that it does, and gives a specic value for the limit. it would be interesting to explicitly compute
the anomalus dimension of [ooc] in perturbation theory. from the previous discussion,

[ooc ] =

1

n 2 (1 + 22 + . . .) + o(cid:18) 1

n 4(cid:19) .

if the interpolation between small and large  is a smooth crossover, it is natural to expect the
coefcient 1 to be negative, as supergravity predicts a negative asymptotic value for   .
while the ndependence of the anomalous dimension of [obob] follows simply from large
n counting rules in sym theory, the space-time dependence of the correlators cannot be simply
inferred from sym. supergravity results demonstrate that to order 1/n 2, the 4point correlator
has analytic behavior in position variables, except for a single power of a logarithm. on the
sym side however, our perturbative treatment of the t hooft coupling prevents us from making
any sensible predictions on the space-time dependence of the correlators. while graph (b) of
fig.6 is only power behaved, one expects graphs like (c) to contain higher and higher powers of
logarithms as larger and larger numbers of virtual particles are being exchanged. the malda-
cena conjecture predicts that somehow, as   , all these powers and logarithms rearrange
themselves and combine into a single logarithm.

5 conclusions

we have shown that the supergravity results for 4point functions of chiral sym operators can
be successfully interpreted in terms of a 4d operator product expansion. there is a generic
relation between the powersingular terms that arise in the direct channel limit of an exchange
diagram and the contributions to 4point function of the corresponding conformal partial wave.
logarithmic singularities can be naturally understood in terms of o( 1
n 2 ) renormalization and
mixing of the doubletrace composites that arise in the ope of two singletrace chiral operators.
it should be emphasized that the very possibility of a 4d ope interpretation is quite non
trivial. for example, generic exchange integrals in ads5 contain (log)2 singularities15, which
would be impossible to interpret as o( 1
n 2 ) renormalization effects. it is then crucial that the
couplings of iib supergravity on ads5  s5 do not allow this type of processes.

we did not attempt to interpret the series expansions of the supergravity 4point correlators
beyond the leading logarithmic term. it would be of great interest to extend the analysis of this
paper to the higher order terms. the expansion of the supergravity amplitudes as the operator
insertions become close (see e.g. (a.17)) is given by series with a nite radius of convergence.
this could be regarded as an indication that the the 4d sym theory admits a convergent ope.

a comment is in order about the issue of decoupling of operators dual to string states. we
were able to match the powersingular terms and the leading log with the contributions to the
ope of chiral primaries and their doubletrace products, so our results support the idea that at
strong t hooft coupling it is consistent to ignore the string states. one would ultimately like
to show that for each possible limit as the boundary insertion points become pairwise close, the
expansion of the 4point supergravity amplitude can be interpreted to all orders as a convergent
double ope in terms of the subset of operators given by the chiral operators and their multitrace
products. this would prove that as    this subset forms a closed algebra.

to tackle these issues it might be more convenient to consider a 4point function of n = 4
chiral primaries, the simplest example being the correlator of four 20 operators trx (ix j). the
eld theory analysis is somewhat cleaner than in the dilaton/axion sector since there are fewer
doubletrace operators of approximate dimension 4 than of approximate dimension 8. on the su-
pergravity side the computation involves exchanges of the 20, of the massless vector and of the
massless graviton, as well as one quartic graph. all the exchange integrals are available and the
only missing piece of information is the numerical value of the quartic interaction vertex of four

15this happens when the exchange integral is equal to an innite sum of quartic graphs. it appears that all

exchanges that arise in iib supergravity on ads5  s 5 can be reduced to a nite sum of quartics graphs [23].

25

20. as noticed in [39], it should be possible to obtain this vertex directly from the 5d gauged
supergravity lagrangian. the ope of two 20 contains doubletrace operators in the 105, 84,
20 and singlet representations. the 105 operator is known to be protected, and it has been
recently argued [40] that the 84 should also be protected due to another shortening condition
of the n = 4 superconformal algebra. the 20 doubletrace operator is not protected but the
superconformal algebra constrains its anomalous dimension to be positive. finally the singlet is
the parent chiralprimary operator from which the [obob] descendent operator considered in
this paper is obtained by applying 8 qs: hence its anomalous dimension must be the same as
[obob]. it would be nice to check these facts through an explicit supergravity calculation.

finally, we would like to remark that although we have conned our investigation to the 4d
n = 4 sym theory, our methods apply to other ads/cft dualities in various dimensions. in
particular, the results of section 2 imply that for any cft that has an ads dual, in the limit
in which the gravity approximation is valid all the singular terms in the ope of two protected
operators are given by other protected operators and their normalordered products.

a summary of supergravity 4point functions

exchange amplitudes for massive scalars, massive vectors and massless gravitons with external
scalar operators were evaluated in [16, 18, 22, 23] in general adsd+1 space. we summarize
here the results for massive scalar amplitudes with nonderivative couplings, and for massless
graviton exchange, dened by

i (t)

scal = z dzgz dwg k1(z, x1)k3(z, x3) g(z, w) k2(w, x2)k4(w, x4)(a.1)

here the coupling of the graviton propagator is to to a conserved stress tensor, given by

t 
13 (z, x1, x3) = dk1(z, x1)dk1(z, x3)

with an analogous expression for t 
. the superscript t in (a.1a.2) indicates that these
integrals dene what we call tchannel exchanges. in our terminology, the graphs in the s and
u channels are obtained from those in the tchannel by letting respectevely (x1, x2, x3, x4) 
(x1, x3, x2, x4) and (x1, x2, x3, x4)  (x1, x2, x4, x3).

adopting the methods of [23], the evaluation of these integrals does not require the explicit

form of the bulktobulk propagators, but only their equations of motion:



ddg  ddg

= (cid:16)gg + gg 
d  1

(2 + m2)g(u) = (z, w)
 + ddg + ddg  2(g  gg
gg(cid:17)(z, w) + d + d

(a.4)



)

remarkably, for all cases that arise in the iib compactication on s5, the amplitudes can be
expressed as simple linear combinations of a nite number of 4point quartic graphs.
it is
convenient to dene the integrals associated with these general quartic graphs as follows:

d1324(x1, x3, x2, x4) = z dd+1z

zd+1

k1(z, x1) k3(z, x3) k2(z, x2) k4(z, x4)

the coefcient functions admit taylor series expansions in powers of t with radius of conver-

the presentation of these series expansions is slightly formal in the sense that for k  q  2, the
(k  q + 2) function in the denominator produces a zero, while the (k  q + 2) term produces
a pole, which together yield a nite result, which amounts to a pole term in s. its coefcient can
be obtained from the formula limx0 (x q)/(x q) = ()q+1(q + 1) for any nonnegative
interger q.

|x23|  |x34| and/or |x14|  |x34| corresponds to s  1/2, t  +1.

both limits were derived in [22] by rst obtaining a suitable expansion for the universal
function i(s, t) and then using (a.15). this expansion may be used to evaluate the logarithmic

in this subsection we will nd the singular terms of a given ads scalar exchange diagram in the
form of an expansion in s and t, and comparing with the singular terms of the corresponding
partial amplitude from (b.10) we will nd an exact match. we recall the result (a.10) that any
exchange supergravity diagram reduces to a sum of quartic graphs. for simplicity, we restrict
ourselves to the case of pairwise equal dimensions, as in the analysis of partial amplitude in the
previous subsection, 13 = 24 = 0. we also recall the expansion of a quartic graph (a.17).
let us assume that 1  2, which means that pmax  2  1. upon insertion of the expansion

we will now evaluate the second summation in this formula. due to the pole of the gamma
function in the denominator for k  p + 2  0, one can extend the psummation to innity.

c dilatonaxion correlators

let o and oc be the operators that couple to the dilaton and axion supergravity elds with unit
strength:

the kinetic terms in the 5dimensional supergravity action are normalized as

sint = z d4x (x)o(x) + c(x)oc(x) .

where the gravitational coupling is given in terms of sym parameters (setting the ads radius

the 2point functions are then (equ.(a.13) of [6])

it is convenient to dene normalized operators o = o, oc = oc, such that

h o(x1) o(x2)i = h oc(x1) oc(x2)i =

the normalization constant  is then

(c.4)

(c.5)

(c.6)

the complete 4point functions in the dilatonaxion sector were assembled in [22]. since the
supergravity action is even under sign reversal of the axion eld, 3 different amplitudes enter:

34

h o o o oi, h o oc o oci and h oc oc oc oci. only graviton exchanges contribute to the
4dilaton amplitude. the 4axion amplitude is given by graviton and dilaton exchanges, but it
was checked in [15] that the dilaton contributions precisely cancel when the s, t and u channels
are added together, so that

h o o o oi = h oc oc oc oci = i0 + (22

5)1 4{i (s)

grav + i (t)

(c.7)

the equality of the 4dilaton and 4axion amplitudes actually follows directly from the u(1)y
symmetry of supergravity. here, i0 is the contribution from disconnected graphs and i (i)
grav is the
graviton exchange integral in the channel i. the tchannel graviton exchange has been given
in terms of quartic graphs in (a.14), the other channels are readily obtained by permuting the
coordinates xi. the disconnected contributions are easily evaluated recalling the normalization
(c.5):

the amplitude h o(x1) oc(x2) o(x3) oc(x4)i is given by the tchannel graviton exchange,
as well as axion exchanges and a quartic interaction. it was shown in [15] that the sum of all

(c.12)

notice that the 4point functions of axions and dilatons do not receive contributions from
exchanges of the xed scalar of m2 = 32 that corresponds [3] to the dilation mode of the s5.

35

the subtleties associated with the computation of 3point functions of two dilatons (or axions)
and a xed scalar were recently discussed in [41, 33]. although naively the cubic coupling of
2 dilatons and a xed scalar is absent in the 5dimensional supergravity lagrangian, the cor-
responding 3point function can be shown to be nonvanishing, either through a procedure of
analytic continuation in the kk level of the dilatons [41], or by a careful dimensional reduc-
tion that takes into account the contraints of the supergravity elds and leads to nonvanishing
boundary interactions [33]. the two procedures give identical results [33]. in the analytic con-
tinuation method, one takes the conformal dimension of the dilatons to be 4 + . the cubic
coupling dilatondilatonxed scalar vanishes as o() in the limit   0, but the 3point inte-
 ), so that the product gives a nite contribution. the procedure of analytic
gral diverges as o( 1
continuation can be immediately used to prove that xed scalar exchanges give no contribution
to the 4point functions of dilatons and axions. in fact, contrary to the 3point function case, the
exchange integral with 4 external dimensions 4 +  and bulk dimension 8 is perfectly convergent
in the limit   0 (see e.g. [18]), whereas the cubic couplings vanish, yielding zero contribution.
c.1 leading logarithm asymptotics

we now determine the leading logarithmic terms in the dilatonaxion 4point functions in the
limits as the points become pairwise close. we adopt the terminology:

a) tchannel limit: |x13|  |x12|, |x24|  |x12|, which corresponds to s, t  0;
b) schannel limit: |x12|  |x13|, |x34|  |x13|, or s  1/2, t  1;
c) uchannel limit: |x23|  |x34|, |x14|  |x34|, or s  1/2, t  1.

the limit of i (t)

grav for s, t  0 (tchannel) was obtained in [22]; its logarithmic parts are

given by

i (t)

for our purposes, we shall need only the leading logarithmic contributions of the amplitudes in
the various channels. as we shall have to use permutations on the points xi to nd the exchange

36

amplitudes in all channels, it will be most convenient to re-express the s and tdependence in
terms of the xi variables. using the numerical values a3(0) = 32

(c.16)

the limits in the crossed channels, where s  1

2 and t2  1, were not obtained explicitly in
[22]. we shall now derive them here, by deriving the crossed channel limits for the w -functions,
starting from (a.24). first, we notice from the denition of k(t) that k(1) = 1/(k + 1).
next, it is clear from (a.24) that a non-trivial leading logarithmic contribution will arise only if
the orders of summation satisfy k = p + q  2    0. since in our expressions p, q  1 in
all cases, and 0    q  1, the inequality above can always be realized and there is always a
k  0 satisfying k = p + q  2  . the remaining summation over  is then

p (xi)   ln(1  t2)

but this -sum is precisely proportional to a hypergeometric function 3f2(p, p, 1  q; p  q +

(c.19)

finally, we need the asymptotic behavior of the function w in this channel with s  1
2 and
t2  1. from (a.17), it is clear that the limit s  1
2 is regular for any xed t. also, the limit
t2  1 is regular, since both coefcients ak(t) and bk(t) have smooth limits. thus, in both the
crossed s- and u-channels, the function w is smooth and produces no logarithmic contributions.
we are now ready to sum all contributions in the crossed channels. for graviton exchange,

we can nally assemble the leading logarithmic asymptotics for the full amplitudes of nor-

are equivalent, so we need only quote

h o o o oi = h oc oc oc oci
