abstract

the renormalization group method is a successive integration over the uc-
tuations which are ordered according to their length scale, a parameter in the
external space. a dierent procedure is described, where the uctuations are
treated in a successive manner, as well, but their order is given by an internal
space parameter, their amplitude. the dierential version of the renormal-
ization group equation is given which is the functional generalization of the
callan-symanzik equation in one special case and resums the loop expansion
in another one.

i. introduction

the renormalization group method is usually applied in two dierent manners. the
original way is to provide an insight into the scale dependence of the coupling constants
[1]. another, more recent use is to perform a partial resummation of the perturbation
expansion by making an innitesimal change of the cuto in a time and using the functional
formalism [2]. this method is sometime called exact [2], [3], [4], [5] because apart of the
assumption of the availability of the loop expansion the only truncation in this scheme is in
the gradient expansion. both goals are realized by the blocking procedure, the successive
elimination of the degrees of freedom which lie above the running ultraviolet cuto. the

resulting evolution equation yields the dependence of the coupling constants in the cuto
which is a scale parameter introduced in the space-time, the external space.

two outstanding problems in this program are the incompatibility of the sharp cuto in
the momentum space and the gradient expansion and the lack of a gauge invariant block-
ing procedure. the gradient expansion is an essential technical device in parametrising the
renormalized action and reects our believe that the important operators are local. unfortu-
nately the strong dependence of the cuto procedure in momentum space generates non-local
terms and spoils this scheme [1]. the soft cuto which is usually oered as the remedy of the
rst problem actually produces other problems. since the separation of the modes according
to their length scales is not gauge invariant, the gauge symmetry is unavoidably lost during
the blocking.

we propose here a dierent slicing procedure of the path integral, the gradual increase of
the amplitude of the uctuations. the relation with the scale dependence is more indirect
but mathematical rigour and exibility is gained. we introduce a cuto in the internal space
by constraining the amplitude of the uctuating eld and obtain the evolution equation by
the gradual release of this constrain. since the eld variable is usually dimensional this
procedure can be interpreted in terms of a scale dependence, as well. more precisely, the
mass parameter of the lagrangian serves as a cuto for both spaces thereby providing a
dynamical correspondence between the scales in the internal and the external spaces. an
important feature of this scheme is that the scale parameter, the mass in particular, is
introduced by hand in the internal space. the length scale of the external space is, on the
contrary, induced dynamically. such a dynamically generated length scale in the external
space appears more natural and avoids the problems mentioned above.
in fact, having
imposed the cuto in the internal space the gradient expansion, being an approximation
procedure in the external space, goes through without problem. the gauge invariance can
be maintained, as well, the only requirement is that the suppression of the uctuations must
be achieved in a gauge independent fashion, a condition easy to comply with in the internal
space. this latter improvement is somehow reminiscent of the achievement of the higgs
mechanism where a dynamically generated mass is produced without spoiling the gauge
symmetry.

there are further advantages in making the blocking in the internal space. one is to get a
new insight into the origin of the anomalous dimension. to see this we recall that the internal
space has actually been used for the purpose of establishing the renormalization group. the
renormalization conditions was imposed at a non-vanishing background eld eld in ref. [6]
providing the scale for the internal space. the resulting beta function was computed in the
one-loop level and found to be identical with the usual beta functions, resulting from the
renormalization conditions introduced in the external space. this agreement between the
scale dependence in the external and internal space is not generally present and the two-
loops results should already yield a dierence. in fact, the scales inferred from these two
spaces are related by the terms of the lagrangian which mix the internal and the external
spaces, the terms with space-time derivatives. the simplest of them is the wave function
renormalization constant, b(x) = z 1/2r(x), which is trivial for a scalar model in the
one-loop approximation. the anomalous dimension is nothing but the demonstration of the
dierence between the scale dependence in the internal and the external spaces.

another bonus of the internal space renormalization group is the generalization of the

2

callan-symanzik equation for the functional formalism. the callan-symanzik equation de-
scribes the dependence of the green functions on the mass [7]. since the mass parameter
controls the width of the peak in the wave functional around the vacuum conguration the
mass can be thought as the simplest cuto parameter in the internal space. the similarity
of the renormalization group coecient functions obtained by the bona de renormalization
group and the callan-symanzik equation demonstrates that the length scale of the exter-
nal space induced by the mass can be identied by the cuto. the functional evolution
equation resulting from the innitesimal change of the mass is the generalization of the
callan-symanzik equation without relying on the multiplicative renormalization scheme.
such an extension, presented below can be used to study non-renormalizable models or
eects close to the cuto.

the renormalization group step can be expressed by means of the bare action or the
eective action. the two schemes become equivalent in the infrared limit. this can be
seen easily by remarking that the loop contributions are suppressed in the infrared limit,
where the ultraviolet cuto tends to zero with the number of degrees of freedom. since the
dierence between the bare and the eective action comes from the loop contributions the
gradient expansion produces the same bare and eective action in the vicinity of the infrared
xed point.

the dierent standard methods to obtain the renormalization group are briey discussed
in section ii. the internal space evolution equation, our new renormalization group scheme
is introduced in section iii. section iv contains the application of the general strategy of the
internal space renormalization to obtain the generalization of the callan-symanzik equation.
the possibility of resumming the loop expansion by solving the evolution equation is shown
in section v. the section vi is for the summary. the appendices give details about the
legendre transformation and the gradient expansion.

ii. renormalization group schemes

in this section we briey recapitulate some methods the renormalization group equation

can be obtained.

the traditional blocking [1] in momentum space yields the wegner-houghton equation
[2] which is based on sharp cuto in the momentum space. consider the action with cuto
k in the derivative expansion,

sk =



xn=0z ddxu (n)

k

[(x), ]

(1)

k

where u (n)
[(x), ] is an n-th order homogeneous polynom in the gradient operator  and
a local functional of the eld variable. we separate the quadratic part of the action in the
eld,

squadr =

1

2 z ddxddy((x)  0(x))g1(x, y; 0)((y)  0(x))

(2)

where

3

g1(x, y; 0) =

2s[]

(x)(y) |=0

(3)

to organize the loop expansion. the blocking step consists of the elimination of the fourier
components of the eld (x) within the shell k  k < p < k. let us write

(x) = (x) + (x)

(4)

where the rst and the second term in non-vanishing in the fourier space for p < k  k
and k  k < p < k, respectively. the blocked action can be written as

eskk[ ] = z d[]esk[ +]

= esk[ +] 1

2 trg1

k [ ]+

(5)

where  is the saddle point, the trace is within the functional space spanned by the plane
waves k  k < p < k, and the dots stand for the higher loop contributions. the density
of the modes to be eliminated, dkkd1, d being the solid angle, is chosen to be small.
this makes the volume of the loop integral appearing in the computation of the trace small,
too. one expects that the n-th loop contributions which contain an n-fold integration in
this small volume will be suppressed as k  0 since the integrand is non-singular in the
integration domain. a more careful argument shows that the small parameter is actually the
ratio of the modes to be eliminated and left in the system [8] assuming that the amplitude
of each fourier mode is of the same order of magnitude1. with this condition kept in mind
the higher loop contributions are dropped yielding the evolution equation

sk[ ]  skk[ ] = 

1
2

trg1[ ] 1 + o  k

k !!

(6)

for vanishing saddle point,  = 0. all we needed in deriving this equation was the availability
of the loop-expansion for the blocking step (5). the simplication, the suppression of the
higher loop contribution results from the appearance of a new small parameter, k/k. we
may call this the scheme the functional form of the bare renormalization group since the
resulting renormalized trajectory is in the space of the cuto theories. the truncation of
the gradient expansion

sk = z ddx(cid:20) 1

2

()2(x) + uk((x))(cid:21)

simplies the functional equation (6) into a partial dierential equation

kkuk() = 

d
2(2)d kd ln[k2 + 2

uk()].

(7)

(8)

1it is enough to introduce an infrared cuto and consider the elimination of the modes one-by-
one when this latter condition fails to become convinced that the limit k  0 can not always
suppresses the higher loop contributions to the blocking relation. such a problem shows up when
there is a non-trivial saddle point to the blocking which enhances certain modes [9].

4

the inclusion of the o(4) higher order terms in the action is problematic because the sharp
momentum space cuto generates non-local interactions.

a similar method was developed for the eective action [3], [4], [5]. one introduces
the cuto parameter k in the quadratic part of the action g1(p)  g1
k (p) in such a
manner that the uctuations with momentum p < k become frozen. this can be achieved
by writing g1
k (p) = f (p/k)g1(p), where f () is a suciently smooth function approaching
1 and  for  =  and  = 0, respectively and changing appreciably within the interval
1   <  < 1 +  only. the path integration consists of the elimination of the modes p > k
and the evolution equation

kz d[]es[]+rx

jxx = z d[]ks[]es[]+rx

jxx

(9)

is obtained for the generator functional. this relation is nally converted into an equation
for the eective action. the application of the chain rule in (9) appears to be a safe non-
perturbative step which should be more general then the derivation of (6). but the simplicity
of (9) is misleading because in order to suppress the uctuations the dependence of the
action in the cuto k, the function f () must be singular which invalidates the chain rule,
(9). at the end one has to consider the nite dierence equation k  k  k in (9)
and the corresponding functional taylor expansion brings in the assumption concerning the
applicability of the loop-expansion.

one can easily circumvent such a purist criticism by introducing a cuto for the cuto,
i.e. taking a function f () which converges to f0 <  at  = 0, applying the chain rule
in (9) and taking the limit f0   at the end of the computation. but this limit may
introduce spurious non-perturbative eects and falls short of making the cuto procedure
well dened. to see this latter point we return to the problem of the gradient expansion,
mentioned above. there are actually two cuto parameters hidden in the function f (p/k),
one is the momentum scale of the cuto p = k and the other is the width k. the sharp
cuto   0 generates non-local interactions and spoils the gradient expansion as mentioned
before. the expansion can be recovered by regulating the discontinuous nature of f (), i.e.
keeping  nite. but this step makes the cuto ill dened. this is obvious for momentum
p  k but problems arise in the ultraviolet regime, p  , as well. in fact, there is no
reason why the structure of f () within the interval

k(1  ) < p < k(1 + )

(10)

should not make a nite impact on the scaling laws. the suppressing strength of the cuto
is nite in this interval and only the k  0 sharp cuto limit can render the contributions
of this momentum range vanishing. the momentum dependence in this narrow window
inuences the sub-leading orders of the gradient expansion and leads to a scheme dependence
even in the asymptotical scaling regime, in certain critical exponents at the ultraviolet xed
point [10].

the more traditional eld theoretical methods for the renormalization group equation are
based on the simplication oered by placing the ultraviolet cuto far away from the scale
of the observables. such a separation of the scales removes the non-universal pieces of the
renormalized action and the rather complicated blocking step can be simplied by retaining
the renormalizable coupling constants only. the underlying formalism is the renormalized

5

perturbation expansion, in particular the multiplicative renormalization scheme. the usual
perturbative proof of the renormalizability asserts that the renormalized eld and the green
functions can be written in terms of the bare quantities as

gn(p1,   , pn; gr())r = z  n

2  gr, gb,



! gn(p1,   , pn; gb, )b 1 + o  p2

2!! ,

(11)

where  is the cuto and the renormalized coupling constants are dened by some renor-
malization conditions imposed at p2 = 2. the evolution equation for the bare and the
renormalized coupling constants result from the requirements

d
d

gr =

d
d

z  n

2 gb = 0,

d

gb =

n

2 gr = 0.

(12)

note that the non-renormalizable operators can not be treated in this fashion because the
o(p/) contributions are neglected in (11). the renormalization of composite operators
and the corresponding operator mixing requires the introduction of additional terms in the
lagrangian. another aspect of this shortcoming is that these methods are useful for the
study of the ultraviolet scaling laws only. the study of the infrared scaling or models where
there are several non-trivial scaling regimes [8] require the more powerful functional form,
mentioned above.

the third procedure is the callan-symanzik equation which is based on the change of

the bare mass parameter,

d
dm2 gb =

d
dm2 z

n

2 gr = z

n

2 z2gcomp

r

(13)

where z2 is the renormalization constant for the composite operator 2(x) and gcomp is
the green function with an additional insertion of 2(p = 0). one can convert the mass
dependence inferred from the callan-symanzik equation into the momentum dependence
by means of dimensional analysis and the resulting scale dependence is the third way of
obtaining the renormalization group equation.

iii. evolution equation

our goal is to obtain the eective action [] of the euclidean model dened by the
action s[], by reducing the renormalization group strategy into an algorithm to solve the
theory. the connection to the external scale dependence will be considered later. the usual
legendre transformation (c.f. appendix a.) yields

and

ew [j] = z d[]es[]+rx jxx

w [j] + [] = zx

jxx = j  ,

the source j is supposed to be expressed in terms of

6

(14)

(15)

x =

w [j]

jx

.

(16)

a cuto  is assumed implicitly in the path integral and s[] stands for the bare, cuto
action. we introduce a modied action of the form

s[] = ss[] + s[]

(17)

in such a manner that the model with    be simple, e.g.
the minimum of a local
functional ss[], is nondegenerate. we plan to follow the  dependence of the eective
action by integrating out the functional dierential equation

from the initial condition

 = f[]

init[] = initss[] + ss[],

(18)

(19)

imposed at init   to  = 0. (18) can be interpreted as a renormalization group equation
which follows the scale dependence because the parameter  in general introduces a scale,
() in the theory, so the trajectory ()[] in the eective action space can be thought as
a renormalized trajectory. another way to interpret (18) is to consider its integration as a
method which builds up the uctuations of the model with  = 0 by summing up the eects
of increasing the uctuation strength innitesimally,     .

the starting point to nd f[] is the relation

[] = w [j] 

w [j]

j

.j + j. = w [j],

 and  being the independent variables. this relation will be used together with

w [j] = ew [j]z d[]ss[]ess[]s[] = ew [j]ss" 

j# ew [j].

it is useful to perform the replacement

which results the evolution equation

[]  ss[] + []

[] = ew [j]ss" 

j# ew [j]  ss[].

(20)

(21)

(22)

(23)

the next question is the choice of ss[]. the simplest is to use a quadratic suppression

term,

ss[] =

1

2 zx,y

xmx,yy =

1
2

  m  .

(24)

if a gauge symmetry should be preserved then such an ss[] is not acceptable and

7

ss[] = s[]

(25)

is the most natural choice. the evolution equation (23) then sums up the loop expansion
and produces the dependence in h. we return now to the case of a simple scalar eld without
local symmetry, (24). the corresponding evolution equation reads as

[] =

1
2

tr(cid:26)m hm + (2)

x1,x2i1(cid:27) ,

where the functional derivative is denoted by

(n)

x1,,xn =

n[]

.

x1    xn

we should bear in mind that (n)
x1,,xn remains a functional of the eld x. the evolution
equation can be converted into a more treatable form by the means of the gradient expansion,

[] = zx(cid:26) zx

2

(x)2 + ux + o(4)(cid:27)

where the notation fx = f (x) was introduced. this ansatz gives

(26)

where the f (n)() = n
 f (). such an expansion is unsuitable for w [j] due to the strong
non-locality of the propagator but might be more successful for the eective action where
the one-particle irreducible structure and the removal of the propagator at the external legs
of the contributing diagrams strongly reduce the non-local eects. the replacement of this
ansatz into (23) gives (c.f. appendix b.)

equation a renormalization group method, i.e. the equivalence of the scales in the internal
and the external spaces in the ultraviolet scaling regime m2  u (2) up to non-universal
contributions. the equivalence of the scales and the elimination of the non-universal con-
tributions requires that the cuto should be far above the mass, m2  2.
the non-vanishing anomalous dimension sets up the relation between the internal and
external space scaling.
in fact, when z 6= 1 the relation (38) becomes eld dependent
according to the rst equation of (34). it is worthwhile comparing what (34) gives in the

with the prediction of the wegner-houghton equation. a possible attempt to save the
gradient expansion with sharp cuto is the following: the contributions to the coecient
functions of the gradient, such as zk(), come from taking the derivative of the loop integral,
the trace in the second equation of (5), with respect to the momentum of the infrared back-
ground eld (x). there are two kind of contributions, one which comes form the derivative
of the integrand, another from the external momentum dependence of the limit of the in-
tegration. it is easy to verify that the -dependent non-local contributions come form the
second types only [5]. thus one may consider the approximation where these contributions
are simply neglected, assuming a cancellation mechanism between the successive blocking
steps. the result is, for k2  u (2)

as a measure of the cancellation of the non-local terms evoked above.

for d = 4 which reproduces the one-loop solution found in [11]. the agreement between the
independent mode approximation to the internal-space renormalization group equation and
the one-loop solution is expected because the right hand side of (26) is o(h).

it may happen that the quadratic suppression is not well suited to a problem. in the
case s[] possesses local symmetries which should be preserved then the choice (25) is more
appropriate. when a non-trivial saddle point appears in the blocking step then it may
develop a discontinuous evolution. the choice (25) makes the saddle point approximatively
renormalization group invariant.

since the momentum dependence in the right hand side of (45) is explicit and simple the one,
two and three loop integrals can be carried out easily by means of the standard methods. the
successive derivatives of the resulting expression with respect to  yield the renormalization
group coecient functions.

vi. summary

the strategy of the renormalization group is developed further in this paper. instead
of following the evolution of the coupling constants corresponding to the same physics our
renormalization group ow sweeps through models with dierent dynamics. the parame-
ter of the ow is the scale of the quantum or thermal uctuations. the result is an exact
functional dierential equation for the eective action. as a special case the functional gen-
eralization of the callan-symanzik equation is recovered. a dierent choice of the blocking
transformation allows us to control h and the resulting ow amounts to the resummation
of the loop expansion.

our scheme can be considered as a renormalization group method in the internal space.
the similarity of the renormalization group ow in the external and the internal space is
shown for the local potential, the zero momentum piece of the eective action. the dierence
between the two schemes is the source of the anomalous dimension and it appears in the
momentum dependent parts of the eective action.

the novel feature of the method is its manifest gauge invariance and the compatibility
with the gradient expansion. these results are achieved by the possibility of characterizing
the modes in the internal rather than the external space where the gauge transformations
and the gradient expansion are carried out.

the integration of the internal space evolution equation provides an algorithm to solve
models in a manner similar to the traditional renormalization group method. the only
truncation is done in the gradient expansion of the eective action, in the taylor expansion
of the 1pi functions in the momentum. we believe that this procedure is an interesting
alternative to the stochastic solution method of the lattice regulated models. the drawback
is that it is rather cumbersome, thought possible in principle, to increase the precision in
the momentum and going to higher orders in the gradient expansion. the advantage is that
it can be cast in innite, continuous space-time equipped with minkowski metric.

appendix b: evolution equation in the internal space

we give here some details on the computation of (30). to get the evolution equation
of the potential part of the gradient expansion (28), one has to take a homogeneous eld
 = 0 in (26). but to distinguish the kinetic contribution from the potential one, a non
homogeneous eld (x) = 0 + (x) is needed, as well. let k be the momentum where the
eld  is non-vanishing. then the eective action can be written as

[] = vdu(0) +

1

2 zq

(q)(q)(cid:16)z(0)q2 + u (2)

 (0)(cid:17) + o(3, k4)

(b1)

where vd is the spatial volume. thus we need the second derivative of the eective action
in (26) up to the second order in  to identify the dierent contributions. the terms
independent of  give the equation for u and the ones proportional to k2 2 the equation

14

for z. the contributions proportional to 2 but independent of k yield an equation for u (2)

which must be consistent with the equation for u. the result is

(b2)

 (0)i (p1 + p2)

1 + q2 + qp1) + u (3)

(2)

p1,p2 = hz(0)p2

1 + q1q2 + 2q1p1) + u (4)

 (0)(p2

1 + 2q2

 (0)i (p1 + p2 + q1 + q2)

finally one computes the inverse of the operator mp1,p2 + (2)
of  and k. the trace over p1 and p2 needs the computations of terms like

p1,p2 and expands it in powers

tr {(p1q1)(p2q2)f (p1, p2)(p1 + p2 + q1 + q2)} =

q2

(q1 + q2)zp

(b3)

and they lead to (30). the consistency with the equation for u (2)


is satised.

appendix c: evolution equation in the external space

the evolution for the blocking in the momentum space is given by the wegner-houghton
equation (6). in order to obtain its simplied version in the gradient expansion one needs the
trace of the logarithm of (2)
p1,p2. this time the trace has to be computed for |p1| and |p2| in the
shell [kk, k]. this implies that |p1+q| has to be in the shell, as well, because (2)
p1,p2 contains
(p1 + p2 + q). this constrain implies the appearance of q2 in the equation for kkzk().
the terms containing q2 are non-local and spoil the the gradient expansion. kkzk() is
proportional to the second derivative of the trace in (6) with respect the momentum q of
the infrared background eld, . the trace can be written as a momentum internal over the
shell [k  k, k]. there are contributions from the dependence on q of the integrand and the
limit of integration. it is worthwhile noting that the later contains all non-local terms.
there are two ways to rid the non-local contributions when the model is solved by the
loop expansion, i.e. by means of loop integrals for momenta 0  p  . one is to use lattice
regularization where the periodicity in the brioullin zone cancel the q dependence of the
domain of the integration. another way to eliminate the non-local terms is to remove the
cuto. since the non-local contributions represent surface terms they vanish as   .
one may furthermore speculate that some of the non-local terms cancel between the
consecutive steps of the blocking k  k  k for a suitable choice of the cuto function
f () in the propagator g1
k (p) = f (p/k)g1(p). ignoring simply the non-local terms leads
to
