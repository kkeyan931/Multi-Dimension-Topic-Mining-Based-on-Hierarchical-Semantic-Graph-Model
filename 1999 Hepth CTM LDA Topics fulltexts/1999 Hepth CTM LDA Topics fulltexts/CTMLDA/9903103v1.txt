abstract

we compare two approaches in supersymmetric connement, the
seiberg formulation and the superconvergence rule. for the latter, the
critical point is 00 = 0 in the landau gauge. we nd 400 = 0 is
the critical point for most of conning theories without a tree-level
superpotential in the seiberg formulation, in particular, in the large
nc and nf limit. we show how conning theories with a discrete
symmetry and a tree-level superpotential connect these two critical
points: the large and small discrete symmetry limits correspond to
the critical points 400 = 0 and 00 = 0, respectively.

1 introduction

there are many approaches to probe connement, the nishijima and oehme-
zimmermann (noz) approach,
lattice calculations, the schwinger-dyson
equations, the recent seiberg formulation, etc. however, relations between
dierent approaches are not clear. indeed, the denition and implication of
connement in these approaches dier from each other. it is important to
compare dierent approaches in order to understand possible relations among
them. to this end, we compare two approaches, the seiberg and the noz
approaches.

i

in the noz approach, the superconvergence rule for the gluon propa-
gator has been investigated [1, 2, 3] and the approach is related with the
kugo-ojima connement mechanism [4]. the superconvergence for the gluon
propagator is realized if z 1
3 = 0, where z3 is the renormalization constant
of the gluon wave function. in this sense connement, as well as other non-
trivial aspects, implies the behavior that some of the renormalization con-
stants, zi or z 1
should vanish. in this approach the renormalization group
(rg) equations play an important role. its discussion is applicable in the
weak coupling region and one-loop rg equations are reliable. in the landau
gauge  = 0, we have z 1
3 = 0, which implies the superconvergence, only if
0 < 0 and 00 < 0, where 0 and 00 are the one-loop -function coecient
of the gauge coupling g and the one-loop anomalous dimension coecient
of the gluon eld, respectively. the noz approach is model-independent.
the condition for the superconvergence is applicable for gauge theories with
any gauge groups and any matter elds. also it is applicable for both non-
supersymmetric and supersymmetric theories [5]. only the -function and
the anomalous dimension are the decisive quantities.

on the other hand, in the seiberg formulation, holomorphy and global
symmetries including r-symmetries play an essential role [6, 7]. by use of
the power of symmetries, one can discuss nonperturbative aspects of super-
symmetric gauge theories in the strong coupling region. in this formulation
connement implies the description of the infrared eective theory in terms
of gauge invariant operators on the moduli spaces. the formulation is theory-
dependent, i.e. the analyses depend on global symmetries of theories. several
types of conning theories without a tree-level superpotential [8], i.e. the the-
ories with non-vanishing superpotential (s-connement) [9], the theories with
vanishing superpotential and quantum deformed moduli space, the theories

1

with vanishing superpotential and an ane moduli space [10], have been
found. furthermore, the conning theories with quantum deformed mod-
uli space are classied into two types:
in one type the quantum deformed
constraint is invariant under the global symmetry (i-connement) and in the
other the constraint is covariant (c-connement) [11]. in addition, recently
several s-conning theories with a tree-level superpotential have also been
found [12, 13, 14].

in order to compare the two approaches mentioned above, it is useful to
write a generic connement condition in the seiberg formulation in terms of
00 and 0 and study its implications in rg equations.

recently, csaki et al. have obtained a generic viewpoint in the seiberg
approach [9]. they have derived necessary conditions for the s-, i- and c-
conning theories, which are written in terms of dynkin indices of matter
elds. we investigate the connement condition following ref.[9] and de-
scribe it in terms of 00 and 0. similarly, we investigate conning theories
with a tree-level superpotential. then, we compare the superconvergence
rule and the implications of seibergs connement and present a conjecture
which would ll the gap between them.

2 superconvergence rule

 = z 1/2

3 a, (0)

first we review briey the superconvergence rule. we begin with the renor-
malization constants for the gluon eld, a(0)
3a = z13a and
g(0) = zgg, where a is the gluon eld and 3a is the three-gluon ver-
tex. here the a(0)
 denotes the unrenormalized gluon eld and the super-
script (0) in (0)
3a and g(0) means the same. obviously, we have the relation
zg = z1z 3/2
. the rg equations for these renormalization constants are
written as dz 1
3 /d = 2z 1
g , where  and  are
the -function of g and the anomalous dimension of the gluon eld. here we
restrict ourselves to the landau gauge  = 0 [15]. the -function and the
anomalous dimension are expanded as,

g /d = (/g)z 1

3 and dz 1

(g) = g3(0 + 1g2 +   ),
(g) = g2(00 + 10g2 +   ).

in the landau gauge, the gluon propagator is given by

d(k) =  g 
d(k2) = z dm2

kk

3 = r dm2(m2). therefore, if z 1

where (m2) is the spectral function. d(k2) follows the same rg equation
as z 1
3 = 0, then we have

3 and we have z 1

the superconvergence sum rule, r dm2(m2) = 0.

now let us calculate z 1

asymptotic free theory, i.e.  < 0, and we consider the weak coupling region
where the one-loop rg equations are reliable. in this case, we use the rg
equations to calculate z 1

and r dm2(m2). we are interested in the

as follows,

= (g/g(0))200/0,

(5)

where g(0) is a nonvanishing nite value at  = 0. because of the asymptotic
freedom, we have the behavior g  0 in the limit   . hence, we
have z 1
superconvergence is

3 = r dm2(m2) = 0 if 00 < 0. thus, the critical point for the

00 = 0.

(6)

in the noz approach it is important to investigate the behavior of the renor-
malization constants, i.e. to calculate zi or z 1
and investigate critical points
of these values. on the other hand, kugo conjectured that z1z 1
3 = 0 is a
sucient condition for the color connement [17].

i

note that the noz approach is generic and the superconvergence rule is
applicable for both supersymmetric and non-supersymmetric gauge theories
with any gauge group and matter elds in any representations. furthermore,
the approach focuses on the weak coupling region implying that one could
derive nontrivial results even from knowledge at the weak coupling region.

3 the seiberg connement

in the seiberg formulation, the probe of conning theories implies investi-
gation of the superpotential of gauge invariants together with their moduli
space and constraints. several types of conning theories have been found
[8], s-connement [9], i-connement, c-connement [11] and ane conne-
ment [10].

for example, in the supersymmetric qcd with the gauge group su(nc)
and nf avors of quark pairs, the case with nf = nc corresponds to the
i-connement, while the nf = nc + 1 case corresponds to the s-connement.
in the supersymmetric qcd, the avor number nf = nc + 1 is a critical
point. for a larger avor nf > nc + 1 we do not have connement.

in ref.[9] necessary conditions for the s-, i- and c-connements have been
derived without the presence of a tree-level superpotential. let us consider
the supersymmetric gauge theory with the gauge group g and n chiral
matter multiplets i (i = 1,    , n). we dene n r-symmetries u(1)ri
(i = 1,    , n) such that for the i-th r-symmetry u(1)ri all chiral matter
elds except the i-th chiral multiplet i have vanishing r-charges and i has
the r-charge qi. these r-symmetries should have vanishing gauge anomaly.
thus, we x the r-charge qi = /i, where

 

n

xj=1

j  g,

(7)

and i is the dynkin index for the gauge representation of i and g is the
index of the adjoint representation. here we follow the normalization used
in ref.[9], where for instance the fundamental representations of the su(n)
group have the dynkin index f und = 1.

the superpotential should have the r-charge 2 for u(1)ri. hence, the

superpotential must be a combination of terms of the form 3q(i/)2i/,

where  is the dynamical scale. for the s-connement we must have the
smooth superpotential, i.e. the exponents of i (i = 1,    , n) should be
positive integers. this implies  = 2 or 1. only the former one is available
in the present normalization [9], i.e.

 = 2

for

s  connement.

(8)

similarly, we can discuss the i- or c-connement, where we have the vanishing

4

superpotential. we have the condition,

 = 0

for

i  and c  connement.

(9)

eqs. (8) and (9) are the necessary conditions for the s-connement and i-
and c-connement, respectively. indeed, in the supersymmetric qcd we nd
 = 2 for nf = nc + 1 and  = 0 for nf = nc.

here we study implications of the conditions (8) and (9) from the view-
point of the noz approach. we consider the weak coupling region where
the one-loop rg equations are reliable. we describe the conditions (8) and
(9) in the plane (0, 00). in supersymmetric gauge theory, 0 and 00 are
obtained as

n

(162)20 = 3g +

(162)200 = 

3
2

g +

n

xi=1
xi=1

i = 2g + ,

i =

2

g + .

here we use eq. (9), so that we nd the relation between 0 and 00,

400 = 0,

(10)

(11)

(12)

for the i- and c-connement. we have 400 = 0 + 3/(162) for the s-
connement.
the large nc limit of the gauge
group su(nc), it becomes eq.(12). the large g limit also implies the large
avor number limit through eqs.(8) and (9).

in the large g limit, e.g.

in the ane conning theories [11], the universal index constraint is no
longer applicable. however, in the large g limit the relation (12) is realized
for the theories explicitly obtained in ref.[11] [18]. furthermore, the other
type of conning theory has been found, i.e. the so(n) gauge theory with
(n  3) vectors [20]. this theory is not classied into any type of the above.

this theory has 2pj j < g and 2pj j = g in the large n limit. hence,

in such limit we have 5/200 = 0.

as a result eq. (12) in the (0, 00) plane is signicant for most of the
seiberg type of conning theories, in particular i- and c- connement and s-
and ane connement for large g. it is dierent from the critical point of
the superconvergence (6). by performing calculations similar to eq.(5), we
nd that eq.(12) is the critical point for the value z 1
=

, i.e. z 1

1 z 1/2

5

0 if 400 < 0. similarly, z 1
vanishes if 300 < 0. these regions require
less matter elds than 00 < 0. therefore, the single condition z 1
3 = 0
appears not to be sucient for the seiberg type of supersymmetric conning
theories.

1

before we consider the gap between eqs.(12) and (6) through investiga-
tion of a tree-level superpotential, we give a comment on a recent lattice
calculation [21], which shows that there is a connement phase for the non-
supersymmetric qcd with the gauge group su(3) and 6 or less avors of
quark pairs. amusingly, this coincides with the region with 300 < 0 for the
non-supersymmetric case.

up to now, we have considered conning theories without a tree-level su-
perpotential. in particular, eq.(12) is signicant for the i- and c- connement
and s- and ane connement for large g. now we discuss conning theo-
ries with a tree-level superpotential. such a consideration is suggestive for
understanding the origin of the gap between eq.(12) and eq.(6) as we shall
see.

recently, several s-conning theories with a tree-level superpotential have
been discussed [12, 13, 14]. these new s-conning theories are shown in table
1. they have nf avors of fundamental pairs for the gauge groups su(nc)
and sp(2nc) and nf avors of vector representations for the gauge group
so(nc). in addition, they contain additional tensors and the tensors have a
tree-level superpotential. the presence of a tree-level superpotential breaks
explicitly some of u(1) symmetries which play an essential role in the index
constraint. thus, neither eq.(8) nor (9) holds. instead, these theories possess
discrete symmetries which are shown in table 1.

for example, let us take the second theory in table 1, which has the
gauge group su(nc), nf avors of quark pairs, an additional antisymmetric
tensor multiplet and its conjugate x and x, and the tree-level superpotential
wtree = tr(x x)k+1 [13]. this theory has the discrete symmetry z2(k+1)nf .
if nc = (2k + 1)nf  4k  1, s-connement is realized. the theory with one
avor less has a quantum modied moduli space. in the second s-conning
theory we have  = 2(nf  2) and g = 2(2k + 1)nf  8k  2 as shown
in table 1. as the discrete symmetry becomes large, i.e. k increases, the
relation between 00 and 0 becomes close to eq.(12). on the other hand, as
the discrete symmetry becomes small, the ratio 0/00 increases. to simplify
the discussion, here we take the large nf limit as we did previously. we

6

denote the discrete symmetry as z(m+1)nf . in this case, we have

 = 2nf ,

g = 2mnf .

(13)

indeed these relations in the large nf limit always hold in any s-conning
theory with the discrete symmetry z(m+1)(nf +) among the theories shown in
table 1. thus, we can obtain a common relation,

0
00

=

4m + 2
m + 2

,

(14)

for the large nf limit. as the discrete symmetry and m become small, the
ratio 0/00 becomes large, i.e. 00 approaches the point 00 = 0 from the
negative side for 0 xed. actually for m = 2 we have 00 = 0, which is
the critical point for the superconvergence rule (6). note that the discrete
symmetry corresponding to m = 1 is realized only for the rst, sixth and
eighth theories in table 1, but in this case the superpotential corresponds
to a mass term of x. after integrating out the heavy mode x, we are left
with no superpotential. thus, m = 2 is the minimum value. on the other
hand, as the discrete symmetry and m become large, the ratio approaches the
value 0/00 = 4. the relation (12) is realized at the limit z(m+1)nf
 z.
this aspect is quite suggestive and seems to be of signicance. we have
shown that there is indeed a gap for the critical values of (00, 0) between
the superconvergence rule and the seiberg type of conning theories without
a tree-level superpotential. the former critical point is 00 = 0, while the
latter one is 400 = 0. however, the above theories with a superpotential
and the discrete symmetry z(m+1)nf provide with a bridge over the gap. the
small and the large z(m+1)nf limits correspond to 00 = 0 and 400 = 0,
respectively. that would imply that below 00 = 0 connement could, in
principle, happen, but large global symmetries prevent its occurrence. thus,
in order to nd out what else, besides the superconvergence rule, is needed,
specic types of global symmetries should be further investigated. this would
provide with a physical understanding of the relation between the dierent
approaches to connement.

4 conclusion

we have studied the supersymmetric conning theories already obtained in
the seiberg formulation from the noz viewpoint. we have described the

7

connement conditions in terms of 0 and 00. the region around 400 = 0
seems to be signicant. the single condition 00 < 0, i.e. z 1
3 = 0 is not
sucient for the seiberg type of supersymmetric conning theories. there
is a gap between the critical points for the seiberg type of supersymmetric
conning theories and the superconvergence rule, i.e. 400 = 0 and 00 = 0.
we have also considered conning theories with the discrete symmetry
z(m+1)nf and a tree-level superpotential. in this type of theories, the ratio
0/00 is close to 4 for large m and the ratio increases as m decreases. thus,
the large discrete symmetry z(m+1)nf corresponds to the critical point 400 =
0 and the small discrete symmetry corresponds to the critical point for the
superconvergence rule 00 = 0. this strongly suggests that what makes the
gap between 400 = 0 and 00 = 0 is the existence of global symmetry.

here we have considered the conning theories with the discrete sym-
metry z(m+1)nf and a tree-level superpotential, which have been previously
obtained. although we have derived the common relation (14) from the con-
sideration of explicit theories of table 1, we are inclined to suggest that this
relation could hold in general. therefore, it is of importance to extend further
the analyses to more general types of theories with discrete symmetries.

[18] for some of ane conning theories, the connement is realized only for
certain gauge groups, but we can not take the large g limit. for them,
the above statement does not hold. in particular, one unique theory
among them is the su(2) gauge theory with one chiral multiplet in the
spin 3/2 representation of su(2) [19]. it has the positive 00 and thus
the condition 00 < 0 is not even satised.
