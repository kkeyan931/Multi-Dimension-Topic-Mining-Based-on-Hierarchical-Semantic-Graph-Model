abstract

the canonical decomposition of a real klein-gordon eld in collective
and relative variables proposed by longhi and materassi is reformulated on
spacelike hypersurfaces. this allows to obtain the complete canonical reduc-
tion of the system on wigner hyperplanes, namely in the rest-frame wigner-
covariant instant form of dynamics. from the study of dixons multipoles
for the energy-momentum tensor on the wigner hyperplanes we derive the
denition of the canonical center-of-mass variable for a klein-gordon eld
conguration: it turns out that the longhi-materassi global variable should
be interpreted as a center of phase of the eld conguration. a detailed study
of the kinematical external and internal properties of the eld congura-
tion on the wigner hyperplanes is done. the construction is then extended to
charged klein-gordon elds: the centers of phase of the two real components
can be combined to dene a global center of phase and a collective rela-
tive variable describing the action-reaction between the two feshbach-villars
components of the eld with denite sign of energy and charge. the dixon
multipoles for both the energy-momentum and the electromagnetic current
are given. also the coupling of the klein-gordon eld to scalar relativistic
particles is studied and it is shown that in the reduced phase space, besides

the particle and eld relative variables, there is also a collective relative vari-
able describing the relative motion of the particle subsytem with respect to
the eld one.

i. introduction

recently a new instant form of dynamics, the rest-frame wigner-covariant instant form,
was dened in ref. [1] as an important tool for the program of obtaining a unied de-
scription of the four interactions with a canonical reduction to the independent degrees of
freedom (diracs observables for a generalized coulomb gauge; see ref. [2] for a review).
this tool emerged from the study of the reformulation of ordinary theories in minkowski
spacetime on arbitrary spacelike hypersurfaces as a prerequisite to their description in curved
spacetimes. since this formulation is the classical background of the tomonaga-schwinger
description of quantum eld theory, this new instant form will also open the possibility to
obtain a wigner-covariant equal time quantization of minkowski theories, to dene a set of
tomonaga-schwinger asymptotic states and to open new possibilities for the description of
relativistic bound states, whose formulation in the framework of the standard fock approach
is still problematic (see ref. [3] and the spurious solutions of the bethe-salpeter equation
[4]).

in the rest-frame instant form of every isolated system there is a 3+1 splitting of
minkowski spacetime with a foliation whose leaves, labelled by a scalar time parameter
 , are the spacelike wigner hyperplanes w  orthogonal to the four-momentum of the iso-
lated system (assumed timelike). in an arbitrary lorentz frame the points of the wigner
hyperplane w  have coordinates z(, ~) = x
s ( ) is an
arbitrary origin for the 3-coordinates ~ on w  and p
s , its conjugate momentum, is orthog-
onal to w  [
r (u(ps)) are three suitable spacelike four-vectors tangent to w  ]. after the
canonical reduction of the isolated system to the wigner hyperplanes we remain with four
universal rst class constraints [1]:
i) one, p2
tonian for the evolution in the rest-frame time;
ii) three others dening the rest frame by the requirement that the (wigner spin 1) total
3-momentum of the isolated system is zero, ~psys  0 [so that p
s  msysu(ps), with the unit
four-vector u (ps) describing the orientation of the wigner hyperplanes with respect to the
arbitrary lorentz frame].

sys, identifying the invariant mass msys of the isolated system as the hamil-

r (u(ps))r: the point x

s ( ) + 

s  m 2

among the physical canonical degrees of freedom there are the coordinates of a point of
the wigner hyperplane, dierent from its covariant origin x
s ( ) of the internal 3-coordinates,
with canonical noncovariant coordinates x
s ( ). this point, the classical analogue of the
newton-wigner position operator, is decoupled from the system, describes its external
center-of-mass variable and may be interpreted as a decoupled point particle observer with
his clock measuring the rest-frame time. instead, on the wigner hyperplane there are only
physical canonical relative degrees of freedom, whose identication requires the addition of
three gauge xing constraints ~xsys  0, so that the constraints ~xsys  0 and ~psys  0 are
second class and may be eliminated. these constraints ~xsys  0 may be interpreted as the
elimination of an internal center-of-mass-like variable of the system, which is the gauge
variable conjugated to the rst class constraints ~psys  0, so not to have a double counting
of the center-of-mass degrees of freedom. the constraints ~xsys  0 eliminate this internal
center-of-mass-like variable from the physical degrees of freedom forcing it to coincide with
the arbitrary origin x

s ( ) = z(, ~ = ~xsys = 0) of the wigner hyperplane.

an open problem is the identication of these constraints ~xsys  0 for the various isolated

3

systems. in a future paper [5] it will be studied for a system of scalar particles. instead,
in this paper we will study this probem for the real klein-gordon eld, as a particular
aspect of the more general problem of nding canonical collective and relative variables for
its congurations. in refs. [6,7] longhi and materassi found a set of such variables in the
standard lorentz covariant approach. in this paper we shall reformulate their solution on
the wigner hyperplanes starting from the formulation of the klein-gordon eld on arbitrary
spacelike hypersurfaces in minkowski spacetime [8]. then, after having expressed the energy-
momentum tensor of the klein-gordon eld on the wigner hyperplanes, where it assumes
a form similar to the energy-momentum tensor of a relativistic perfect uid, we shall study
dixons multipoles [9] of the eld. this will open the way to the identication of the
internal center of mass ~x = ~q of the klein-gordon eld and to the realization that the
longhi-materassi collective variable is not the center of mass but a center of phase of the
eld conguration.

by considering a klein-gordon eld conguration as a relativistic extended object, we
can make a detailed study of the kinematical properties of the description of such an object
on wigner hyperplanes.

then we shall apply the same approach to the system of n scalar particles interacting
with a real klein-gordon eld and to the system of a complex charged klein-gordon eld
plus the electromagnetic eld.
in the latter case its two components with denite sign
of energy and charge (identied by means of the feshbach-villars formalism in absence of
interaction) generate two centers of phase, so that, besides the global center of phase of
the complex eld, there is a second collective variable describing the global action-reaction
between the two components. a similar collective variable exists also for the system of n
particles interacting with a real klein-gordon eld.

in section ii the real klein-gordon eld is reformulated on spacelike hypersurfaces in

minkowski spacetime, following ref. [8], and then restricted to wigner hyperplanes.
in section iii its modulus-phase variables on the wigner hyperplane are dened.
in section iv there is the denition of the collective and relative canonical variables and
the inverse canonical transformation to express the original real klein-gordon eld in terms
of them.
it is shown that each constant energy surface of the klein-gordon eld is the
disjoint union of symplectic manifolds. also a set of canonical multipoles is dened for a
certain class of eld congurations and there are some comments on the self-interactions of
the eld.

in section v the energy-momentum tensor of a conguration of the real klein-gordon
eld is restricted to the wigner hyperplanes and there is a study of dixons multipoles on
it. this suggests a denition for the relativistic center of mass of the eld conguration.

in section vi, by using the group-theoretical methods of ref. [10], there is a complete
discussion of the concepts of external and internal (with respect to the wigner hyper-
plane) centers of mass of the eld conguration. the longhi-materassi collective variable is
interpreted as a center of phase of the eld conguration.

in section vii the isolated system of n scalar particles interacting with a real klein-

gordon eld is studied to visualize its collective variables and their interpretation.

in section viii the previous analysis is extended to the charged klein-gordon eld by
dening the collective and relative canonical variables for its positive and negative frequency
parts with the help of the feshbach-villars formalism [1113]. the two collective variables

4

can be combined to give the overall center of phase of the eld conguration plus a
collective relative variable. then there is a study of the coupling to the electromagnetic
eld and of the dixon multipoles.

in the conclusions there are some comments about the utility of the multipolar expan-
sions of the klein-gordon eld in general relativity and about the problems existing for the
quantization of the collective and relative variables.

in appendix a there are some notations for spacelike hypersurfaces.
in appendix b there is a review of longhi-materassi papers.
in appendix c there is a review of the feshbach-villars formalism and the denition of
the fourier coecients of the klein-gordon eld corresponding to the solutions of the square-
root klein-gordon equation with both positive (or negative) energy and electric charge in
the free case.

in appendix d there is the expression of the invariant mass for the charged klein-
gordon eld plus the electromagnetic eld on the wigner hyperplanes in terms of the fourier
coecients dened in appendix c.

ii. the real klein-gordon field on spacelike hypersurfaces.

in ref. [8] there is the description of scalar electrodynamics on spacelike hypersurfaces.
in this section we shall review this description restricting ourselves to a real klein-gordon
eld with a self-interaction v () following the scheme of ref. [1] [see appendix a for the
notations;

(, ~) = (, ~)/ ]. the action of a scalar klein-gordon eld reads

s = z d d3n(, ~)q(, ~)

where the conguration variables are z(, ~), (, ~) = (z(, ~)). the main dierence
between the standard theory and the one on spacelike hypersurfaces is that now the cong-
uration variables are the elds (, ~) = (z(, ~)) = (   z)(, ~), with (x) solution of the
klein-gordon equation. these new elds  =   z contain the nonlocal information about
the 3+1 splitting of minkowski spacetime m 4 with a foliation of spacelike hypersurfaces  ,
obtained through an embedding r    m 4, (, ~) 7 z(, ~) [ is an abstract 3-surface
dieomorphic to r3]. the elds (, ~) have a built-in denition of equal time associated
with the lorentz-scalar time parameter  which labels the leaves of the foliation.

since z

(ps, ps) for timelike poincare orbits [p

if we select all the congurations of the system with timelike total momentum [p2

s > 0], we
can restrict ourselves to the special wigner hyperplanes w  orthogonal to p
s . the proce-
dure for doing this canonical reduction implies [1] to boost at rest the variables b
s , with
s;~0);
the standard wigner boost l
s] and then to add the gauge-xings b
s = sign po
a(u(ps))  0
[u(ps) = p
s /s]. these gauge-xings [only six of them are independent], together with
h( )  0, form six pairs of second class constraints. the dirac brackets with respect to
these second class constraints [implying h( )  0] admit the following canonical basis:
(, ~), (, ~), x
s ( ) [it is not a 4-vector, but has only the covariance of the little group of
timelike poincare orbits like the newton-wigner position operator], p
s . as shown in ref. [1],
the indices a = (, r) are replaced by a = (, r); all the quantities b are lorentz scalars,
while the quantities ~b = {br} are spin-1 wigner 3-vectors;
s is a minkowski
4-vector giving the orientation of the wigner hyperplane with respect to a given lorentz
frame. we get j 
s given in eqs.(59) of ref.
[1].

we got a description in which the noncovariant canonical external center-of-mass 3-
variables ~zs, ~ks, move freely and are decoupled from the klein-gordon eld variables (, ~),
(, ~), living on the wigner hyperplane and restricted by ~p  0. to reduce the eld
variables only to relative degrees of freedom one has to nd an internal collective center-
of-mass-like variable ~x[, ] conjugate to ~p, such that the gauge xings ~x  0 force
the position of the eld internal collective variable ~ = ~x to coincide with the origin
s ( ) = z(, ~ = 0) of the wigner hyperplane.
x
in this way we get a decoupled point
particle observer (the external center of mass x
s of the isolated system) whose scalar time
ts   labels the evolution of the relative eld variables on the wigner hyperplanes, dened
by the eld conguration itself, foliating minkowski spacetime.

iii. fourier transform and modulus-phase variables on the

wigner hyperplane.

in the rest-frame wigner-covariant instant form on wigner hyperplanes [in which one
considers only eld congurations with a timelike 4-momentum], we can dene the fourier
coecients of the elds (, ~), (, ~)




a (, ~q) = r d3 [ (q)  (, ~) + i (, ~)] ei((q)~q~),
a (, ~q) = r d3 [ (q)  (, ~)  i (, ~)] ei((q)~q~),

and ~q a spin-1 wigner 3-vector like ~ [on arbitrary hyperplanes all the quantities  ,~ ,q ,
~q, would be lorentz scalars]. the fourier coecients are  -dependent only when there is a
non null self interaction v (); they and their gradients are assumed to belong to the space
l2(dq).

from the poisson brackets { (, ~) ,  (, ~)} = 3 (~  ~), we get [leaving the factor

(q) to agree with the standard notations]

na (, ~q) , a(cid:16), ~k(cid:17)o = i (q) 3(cid:16)~q  ~k(cid:17) ,

p 
found in ref. [6] when the real klein-gordon eld (x) satises certain conditions. the
main results of that paper are reviewed in appendix b.

here, we shall reformulate this approach on the wigner hyperplane. due to its peculiar
wigner covariance properties [1], the weight function f (p, k) [with its generic non poly-
nomial (for instance f  epk) dependence upon p 
 due to manifest lorentz covariance]
may now be replaced by two separate scalar functions f  (p 
 , q), f ( ~p, ~q). moreover, if we
 and ~p
accept that these two functions are singular at ~q = 0, we can take them linear in p 
 f  (q), f ( ~p, ~q) =  ~p  ~qf (q) with a suitable normalization
respectively: f  (p 
for f  (q) and f (q).
from appendix b, we see that we must require the following behaviours also on the

in order to have the poincare generators and the occupation number of section iii nite.

let us remark that the collective and relative canonical variables can be dened in
closed form only in absence of self-interactions of the eld, so that in this section we shall
put v () = v[i, ] = 0.

let us dene the four functionals of the phases

x 

 = z dq(q)f  (q)  (, ~q) ,
~x = z dq~q f (q)  (, ~q) ,
 {x r
{x 

} = 0,

, x s

, x r

} = 0.

(4.2)

depending on two lorentz scalar functions f  (q), f (q), whose form will be restricted by the
following requirements implying that x a

 are canonical variables:

 and p a
o = 1, np r
o = rs, np r
o = r dq2 (q) f  (q) and np r
, x s

, x s

np 
 , x 
since np 
 , x 

following normalizations for f  (q), f (q)

, x 

 , x r

o = 0,

o = 0, np 
o = r dq qrqs f (q), we must require the

(4.3)

moreover, np r

following conditions

 , x 

 , x r

o = r dq(q) qrf (q) , imply the

z dq2(q)f  (q) = 1

z dq qrqsf (q) = rs.
o = r dq(q)qrf  (q) and np 
z dq(q) qrf  (q) = 0,

z dq(q) qrf (q) = 0.

(4.4)

(4.5)

(4.6)

(4.7)

which are automatically satised because f  (q), f (q), q = |~q|, are even under qr  qr.

a solution of eqs.(4.4) and (4.5) is

(4.8)

for the existence of x 

the singularity in ~q = 0 requires (, ~q) q0 q,  > 0, [and not  >  as in eq.(4.1)]
the analogue of the function f (p, k) of ref. [6] is now

, ~x.

f (p, ~q) = f  (q)  (q) p 

  f (q) ~q  ~p,

z dq f (p, ~q)  (q) = p 
z dq f (p, ~q) qr = p r

.

 ,

(4.9)

let us remark that for eld congurations (, ~) such that the fourier transform
 =

(, ~q) has compact support in a sphere centered at ~q = 0 of volume v, we get x 
v r d3q
 1

(q) (, ~q), ~x = 1

v r d3q 3~q

~q2 (, ~q).

b. auxiliary relative variables.

as in ref. [6], let us dene an auxiliary relative action variable and an auxiliary relative

phase variable

i (, ~q) = i (, ~q)  f  (q) p 

  (q) + f (q) ~q  ~p,

 (, ~q) =  (, ~q)   (q) x 

 + ~q  ~x.

(4.10)

(4.11)

the previous canonicity conditions on f  (q), f (q), imply

z dq  (q) i (, ~q) = 0,
z dq qi i (, ~q) = 0.

z dqf  (q)  (q)  (, ~q) dq = 0,
z dqf (q) qi  (, ~q) = 0.

these auxiliary variables have the following nonzero poisson bracket

with

n i(cid:16), ~k(cid:17) ,  (, ~q)o = (cid:16)~k, ~q(cid:17) ,

(cid:16)~k, ~q(cid:17) =  (k) 3(cid:16)~k  ~q(cid:17)  f  (k)  (k)  (q) + f (k) ~k  ~q.

the distribution (cid:16)~k, ~q(cid:17) has the semigroup property
z dq(cid:16)~k, ~q(cid:17) (cid:16)~q, ~k(cid:17) = (cid:16)~k, ~k(cid:17) ,

and satises the constraints:

r dq  (q) (cid:16)~q, ~k(cid:17) = 0, r dq qr (cid:16)~q, ~k(cid:17) = 0,

(4.12)

(4.13)

r dq f  (q)  (q) (cid:16)~k, ~q(cid:17) = 0, r dq qr f (q) (cid:16)~k, ~q(cid:17) = 0.

at this stage the canonical variables i(, ~q), (, ~q) for the klein-gordon eld are replaced

by the noncanonical set x 

 , ~x, ~p, i(, ~q), (, ~q) with the poisson brackets

, x s

, x s

c. canonical relative variables.

we must now nd the canonical relative variables hidden inside the auxiliary ones, which

are not free but satisfy eqs.(4.12) and (4.13).

as in ref. [6], let us introduce the following dierential operator [lb is the laplace-

beltrami operator of the mass shell submanifold h 1

3 (see appendix b and ref. [6,7])]

d~q = 3  m2lb =

which is a scalar on the wigner hyperplane since it is invariant under wigners rotations.

since  (q) and ~q are null modes of this operator [6], we can put

i (, ~q) = d~qh(, ~q),
h (, ~q) = z dk g(cid:16)~q, ~k(cid:17) i(cid:16), ~k(cid:17) ,

with g(cid:16)~q, ~k(cid:17) being the green function of d~q [see refs. [6,7] for its expression]

(4.23)

(4.24)

like in ref. [6], for each zero mode fo(~q) of d~q [d~q fo(~q) = 0] for which one has

d~qg(cid:16)~q, ~k(cid:17) =  (k) 3(cid:16)~k  ~q(cid:17) .
|r dq fo(~q) i(, ~q)| < , we have by integration by parts

we shall restrict ourselves to eld congurations for which i(, ~q) q0 q3+ with  
2,3,lm(~q) [see the

1,3,1m give fo(~q) = (q), ~q]; ii) for l  2 the

since ~q(~~ ) = qcos |~~ |, one can check that pl m6=0 is automatically zero. moreover, in
pl0 the term (q)[(, ~)(, ~ ) (, ~ )(, ~)] does not contribute for symmetry reasons.
therefore, the nal restriction is

these conditions on (, ~) and (, ~) =  (, ~) identify the class of congurations of
the klein-gordon eld for which one can dene the previous canonical transformation and
for which there is no ambiguity in dening a unique realization of the poincare group (the
bms algebra degenerates in the poincare algebra in this case).

we can satisfy the constraints on (, ~q) with the denition [d~q(q) = d~q~q = 0]

(, ~q) = z dkz dkk(, ~k)g(~k, ~k)(~k, ~q),
k(, ~q) = d~q (, ~q) = d~q(, ~q),

therefore, in the free case h(ts, ~q), k(ts, ~q) are constants of the motion [complete inte-
grability and liouville theorem for the klein-gordon eld]. since the canonical variable p

is the hamiltonian for the evolution in ts   , we need the internal variable x

 [which takes place
inside the wigner hyperplane and which can be interpreted as an evolution in the internal

in the free case we have

  ts = x 

by adding the two second class constraints x 

  const.  0, and by
going to dirac brackets, we get the rest-frame hamilton-jacobi formulation corresponding to
the given constant value of the total energy [the eld (ts, ~), which is ts-independent since
it depends only on the internal time x 
- independent]. in this way
we nd a symplectic subspace (spanned by the canonical variables h, k) of each constant
energy [p 
 = const.] surface of the klein-gordon eld. each constant energy surface is not
a symplectic manifold, but in this way it turns out to be the disjoint union (over x

symplectic manifolds determined by x

in this way we have dened a set of canonical multipoles of the elds (ts, ~), (ts, ~),
with respect to ~ = 0 , i.e. with respect to the origin x
s ( ) of the wigner hyperplanes (a
noncanonical covariant centroid) and they are expressed in terms of the nal canonical basis
for the klein-gordon eld.

when the elds have a compact support w in momentum space, it can be shown that

the only nonvanishing poisson brackets of these multipoles are

v. the energy-momentum tensor on wigner hyperplanes,

dixons multipoles and the center of mass of a field

configuration.

let us now look at other properties of the klein-gordon eld on the wigner hyperplanes.
in particular we are interested in identifying which kind of collective variables describe the
center of mass of a eld conguration and which is their relation, if any, with the previous
collective variables.
in so doing, we shall consider a eld conguration as a relativistic
extended body and we shall study its dixon multipoles [9].
the euler-lagrange equations from the action (2.1) are

when a[gz

b] = 0, as it happens on the wigner hyperplanes in the gauge ts    0,
~( ) = 0, we get the conservation of the energy-momentum tensor t ab, i.e. at ab = 0.
otherwise, there is compensation coming from the dynamics of the surface.

the conserved, manifestly lorentz covariant, energy-momentum tensor of the klein-
(x) (x)  m2 2(x)] +  (x) (x) becomes
gordon eld t (x)[ ] =  1

stress(ts, ~)[], from the last line of the expression of the energy-momentum tensor we
see that it acquires a form reminiscent of the energy-momentum tensor of an ideal relativis-
tic uid as seen from a local observer at rest (eckart decomposition; see ref. [14] ): i) the
constant normal u(ps) to the wigner hyperplanes replaces the hydrodynamic velocity eld
of the uid; ii) [, ](ts, ~] is the energy density; iii) p[, ](ts, ~) is the analogue of the
pressure (sum of the thermodynamical pressure and of the non-equilibrium bulk stress or
viscous pressure); iv) q[, ](ts, ~) is the analogue of the heat ow; v) t rs

vi. external and internal canonical center of mass,

mollers center of energy and fokker-pryce center of

inertia

let us now consider the problem of the denition of the relativistic center of mass of
a klein-gordon eld conguration, after having seen in the previous section, eq(5.12),
dixons denition of this concept in the multipolar approach. let us remark that in the
approach leading to the rest-frame instant form of dynamics on wigners hyperplanes there
is a splitting of this concept in an external and an internal one. one can either look
at the isolated system from an arbitrary lorentz frame or put himself inside the wigner
hyperplane.

from outside one nds after the canonical reduction to wigner hyperplane that there is
an origin x
s ( ) for these hyperplanes (a covariant noncanonical centroid) and a noncovariant
canonical coordinate x
s ( ) describing an external decoupled point particle observer with
a clock measuring the rest-frame time ts. associated with them there is the external
realization (2.9) of the poincare group.

instead, all the degrees of freedom of the isolated system (here the klein-gordon eld
conguration) are described by canonical variables on the wigner hyperplane restricted by
the rest-frame condition ~p  0, implying that an internal collective variable ~x is a
gauge variable and that only relative variables are physical degrees of freedom (a form of
weak mach principle). inside the wigner hyperplane at  = 0 there is another realization of
the poincare group given by eqs. (3.4), (3.5) with generators p 
 | =0 =
s r
 , the internal poincare algebra. by using the methods of ref. [10] (where there is a
complete discussion of many denitions of relativistic center-of-mass-like variables) we can
build the following three internal (that is inside the wigner hyperplane) wigner 3-vectors
corresponding to the 3-vectors canonical center of mass ~q, moller center of energy ~r
and fokker-pryce center of inertia ~y (the analogous concepts for the relativistic n-body
problem are under study [5]).

the wigner 3-vector ~q is therefore the canonical 3-center of mass of the klein-gordon

r (u(ps)) where the
energy of the eld conguration is concentrated]. instead, the previous variable ~x should be
better named the center of phase of the eld conguration. there should exist a canonical

from particles to elds.

the gauge xing ~q  0 [it also implies ~( ) = 0 like ~x  0] forces all three internal
s of the wigner hyperplane. we shall
s (0) +  u(ps) the origin in this gauge, because, as we shall see, in this
( ) =
t (ts)[] 6= 0, it
in the gauge ~q  0 the origin becomes the dixons center of mass which coincide with the
internal moller center of energy as shown in eq.(5.12) [and then eq.(5.16) implies that the
origin is also the tulczyjew [16] and the pirani [17] centroid (see ref. [18] for a review of these
concepts in relation with the papapetrou-dixon-souriau pole-dipole approximation of an
extended object), because they are dened by pss

in the gauge ts    0 the hamiltonian is hr = m  ~( )  ~hp.
let us make a canonical transformation from the canonical basis ~i( ), ~i( ), (, ~),

the variable ~+( ) is playing the role of a naive internal center of mass for the particles
on the wigner hyperplane. from the discussion of the previous section, it is clear that the
real internal center of mass of the n particles is a ~q+ dened like ~q of eq.(6.2) with
k. but, since it is not known (like it happens for
7 ~q+, ~+, ~qa, ~qa identifying
the klein-gordon eld) the canonical transformation ~i, ~i
the real relative variables ~qa, ~qa [see however ref. [5]], we shall go on with the previous
naive canonical transformation in the following discussion to see which kind of collective and
relative variables emerge for the particles plus the real klein-gordon eld.

~r+ = pn

i ~i/pn

k=1qm2

i=1qm2

k + ~2

i + ~2

we also remark that we use the eld center of phase ~x and not the real internal
center of mass ~q, because the knowledge of the canonical basis containing ~x allows us to
illustrate interpretational aspects which will hold also with the canonical basis containing
~q when it will be found.

we can now replace the canonical variables ~+, ~+, ~x, ~p with the following canonical

ones

we see that ~y is playing the role of the naive internal center of mass of the full

particles+eld system: it is the gauge variable conjugate to ~hp  0
the eld naive centers of mass and rule the action-reaction between the two subsystems.

when the decomposition into center-of-mass and relative variables will be available for
the transverse electromagnetic eld in the coulomb gauge, one will be able to make a similar
treatment of the isolated system consisting of n charged particles (with grassmann-valued
electric charges) plus the electromagnetic eld [1,8].

viii. charged klein-gordon field.

following ref. [8], let us now consider a charged klein-gordon eld:  = 12

(1  i2) [1 = 12

therefore, we have the following primary constraints

h(, ~) = (, ~) 

  [ rsrs  m2](cid:17)(, ~) +

l(, ~)(cid:16)
+zs(, ~) rs(, ~)(cid:16)r + r(cid:17)(, ~)  0,

and the following dirac hamiltonian

we nd that the time constancy of the primary constraints implies the existence of no
secondary constraint. the constraints turn out to be rst class.

after the restriction to spacelike hyperplanes z(, ~) = x

are reduced to the following ones

h( ) = z d3h(, ~) =

(8.6)

the only surviving constraints on the wigner hyperplanes [with the reduced canonical

variables x
standard dirac brackets] are

s ( ), p

h( ) = s z d3h + ~  ~ + m2i(, ~)  0,
~hp( ) = z d3h ~ + ~i(, ~)  0.

the lorentz generators have the form of eq.(2.9) with the spin tensor

srs
s  srs

 | ~p=0 = z d3(cid:16)rhs + si(, ~)  (r  s)(cid:17).

with the gauge xing  = ts    0 the nal hamiltonian becomes

the fourier coecients ai(, ~), i=1,2, correspond to the description of the eld as two
real klein-gordon elds i. instead, as shown in appendix d, the fourier coecients a

energy and electric charge, which are nonlocal combinations of  and .

where the conguration variables are z(, ~), (, ~) = (z(, ~)) and a a(, ~) =
a(, ~) a(z(, ~)) [ (z) and a(z) are the standard klein-gordon eld and electromagnetic
z
potential, which do not know the embedding of the spacelike hypersurface  in minkowski
spacetime like  and a a].

the canonical momenta are

(8.23)

we nd that the time constancy of the primary constraints implies the existence of only one
secondary constraint

(, ~) = r r(, ~) + ie(  )(, ~)  0.

(8.24)

we can verify that these constraints are rst class with the algebra given in eqs.(125) of

ref. [1].

the poincare generators are like in eq.(2.6).

(8.26)

(8.27)

to make the reduction to diracs observables with respect to the electromagnetic gauge
transformations, let us recall [20,21] that the electromagnetic gauge degrees of freedom
are described by the two pairs of conjugate variables a (, ~),  (, ~)[ 0], em(, ~) =
 1


~  ~a(, ~), (, ~)[ 0], so that we have the decompositions



ar(, ~) =

(8.30)

the dirac observables for the klein-gordon eld are

(8.31)

therefore, in the generalized wigner-covariant coulomb gauge a (, ~) = em(, ~) = 0,

we have (, ~) = [ (, ~)], (, ~) = [(, ~)] like in the free case.

the constraints take the following form

h( ) = s  {

~hp( ) = z d3(~  ~b)(, ~) +z d3( ~  + ~ )(, ~)  0,

(8.32)

where the coulomb self-interaction appears in the invariant mass and where the 3 constraints
dening the rest frame do not depend on the interaction since we are in an instant form of
the dynamics. the nal form of the rest-frame spin tensor is

srs

s = z d3{r[(~  ~b)s + s  + s ]  (r  s)}(, ~) =

 ( ) +z d3{r[(~  ~b)s  (r  s)}(, ~).

(8.33)

if we go to the gauge  = ts    0, we can eliminate the variables s, ts, and the

 -evolution (in the lorentz scalar rest-frame time) is governed by the hamiltonian

we see that the non-local velocity-dependent self-energy is formally playing the role of

a scalar potential.

fourier coecients a, b [the elds a, b and the fourier coecients a, b, tend to the free

ix. conclusions.

in this paper we have made a detailed study of the kinematical description of scalar klein-
gordon elds on the wigner hyperplanes of the rest-frame wigner-covariant instant form of
dynamics. we have considered a klein-gordon eld conguration as a relativistic extended
object and we utilized both phase space techniques from relativistic particle mechanics and
multipolar expansions from relativistic uidodynamics to study aspects of the klein-gordon
eld which are usually ignored notwithstanding the relevance of scalar elds in physics:
higgs particles, bose-einstein condensation, brans-dicke scalar-tensor general relativity and
multipolar expansions for the theory of gravitational waves, boson stars.

simultaneously, we have used the klein-gordon eld as an example to explore the de-
scription of isolated systems on the wigner hyperplanes showing how the elusive concept
of relativistic center of mass has to be divided in an external part (with respect to an
arbitrary lorentz frame) and in an internal part (inside the wigner hyperplane). in both
cases a canonical noncovariant newton-wigner-like center of mass, a covariant noncanonical
fokker-pryce center of inertia and a noncanonical noncovariant moller center of energy may
be dened only in terms of the generators of suitable realizations of the poincae algebra.
the three internal centers weakly coincide due to the three rst class constraints dening
the rest frame of the isolated system and are, therefore, gauge variables inside the wigner
hyperplanes. namely there is the gauge freedom in the choice of the external timelike
worldline to which they have to be attached. now, in the description of the wigner hyper-
plane with respect to an arbitrary lorentz frame in minkowski spacetime this gauge freedom
is reected in the arbitrariness of the choice of a timelike worldline x
s ( ), with noncanonical
4-coordinates, to be used as origin of the internal 3-coordinates. the natural gauge xing
for this gauge freedom is to put the three weakly coinciding internal centers in this origin:
in this way the origin x
s ( ) is forced to coincide with the external covariant noncanon-
ical fokker-pryce center of inertia and simultaneously to satisfy the conditions for being
both the pirani and the tulczyjew centroid. around this worldline there is a noncovariance
worldtube (whose nite extension is measured by the moller radius [22,2]) containing all
the pseudoworldlines of the noncovariant external canonical newton-wigner-like center of
mass and noncanonical moller center of energy.

naturally, one could x the gauge freedom in a dierent way by identifying a dierent
internal collective 3-vector with the origin x
s becomes one of the many
possible covariant noncanonical centroids existing in literature and does not coincide with the
external fokker-pryce center of inertia. for instance this happens for the klein-gordon
eld, because we do not yet know its canonical basis containing the internal center of
mass 3-vector. in the longhi-materassi canonical decomposition of the klein-gordon eld
in collective and relative variables this 3-vector is replaced by another 3-vector, which can
be named the internal center of phase of the eld conguration by its construction.

s : in such a case x

the other main result of this paper is the identication of the canonical basis containing
the internal center of phase of the klein-gordon eld and of its multipoles in the framework
of the rest-frame wigner-covariant instant form of dynamics.

therefore, many unrelated kinematical concepts nd a well dened setting on the wigner
hyperplanes of the rest-frame wigner-covariant instant form of dynamics, which seems to
be the natural tool (like the separation of the center-of-mass motion in the nonrelativistic

65

case) to be used in relativistic statistical mechanics and in lattice gauge theories due to its
intrinsic euclidean signature (without any wick rotation) and to its associated description
of the evolution by means of the lorentz scalar rest-frame time measured by the clock of
the decoupled (but noncovariant) point particle observer dened by the external canonical
center of mass.

even if much work is still needed to clarify all the aspects of the multipolar expansions of
the klein-gordon eld and of its properties as a relativistic extended object, especially for
the charged elds of scalar electrodynamics, now we have a well dened framework in which
to make further investigations and a rst completely worked out canonical decomposition of
the eld in collective and relative variables.

a nal comment on quantization. the canonical basis of the klein-gordon eld con-
taining the center of phase does not seem a good candidate for the quantization of the eld
in the rest-frame instant form of dynamics both due to the complicated expression of the
original elds in terms of the new variables and to the fact that there is no sound canonical
quantization of phases and angles (dierent is the case with their exponentials) as can be
seen from the various articles contained in ref. [23]. let us remark that the problem of the
non measurability of absolute phases (see the previous reference) is connected with the open
problem of the measurability of the external decoupled noncovariant canonical center of
mass of an isolated system (the quantization of these degrees of freedom would generate an
equivalent of the wave function of the universe) as it is clear from the longhi-materassi
canonical basis, in which the collective position variable is built starting from the phases of
the fourier coecients of the klein-gordon eld.

appendix b: the klein-gordon field.

let us review the main results of ref. [6]. for the sake of simplicity we shall denote (x)

the klein-gordon eld (x) of section iii.

given a real eld, solution of the klein-gordon equation, (x) = (x) = (xo, ~x) =

r dk[a(~k)eikx + a(~k)eikx] [with dk = d3k/(k), (k) = (2)3(k), (k) = ko = m2 + k2,
k = |~k|; a(~k) and a(~k)/ki are assumed to be in l2(dk); a(~k) is xo-independent in
the free case without self interactions v ()], its conjugate momentum is (x) = (x)
xo =
ir dk(k)[a(~k)eikx  a(~k)eikx]. the 10 poincare generators

by putting a(~k) = qi(~k)ei(~k), one gets
 = r dk ki(~k),
 = r dki(~k)(ki 
and they are nite if: a) for k   one has |i(~k)|  k3,  > 0, |(~k)|  k; b)
for k  0 one has |i(~k)|  k3+,  > 0, |(~k)|  k,  > .
the non vanishing poisson brackets of these 3 canonical bases are: {(xo, ~x), (xo, ~y)} =
3(~x  ~y), {a(~k), a(~q)} = i(k)3(~k  ~q), {i(~k), (~q)} = (k)3(~k  ~q).
let f (p, k) = f (p k, p 2
 ) be a real scalar weight function, arbitrary apart the normal-
ization r dkkf (p, k) = p 
 ; a simple choice for f is f  epk. one assumes a behaviour
of f for k   and k  0 such that all the integrals, which depend on f , are nite.

then one can dene the following canonical basis

here, d is the non compact operator d = 3  m2lb, with lb being the laplace-
beltrami operator on the mass shell submanifold h 1
3 dened by kk = m2 and ko > 0.
the green function g satises d~kg(~k, ~q) = (k)3(~k  ~q). finally, one has (~k, ~q) =
(k)3(~k  ~q)  q 

f (p, k).

(b3)

this canonical transformation exists (without problems from the existence of the zero
modes of the operator d) only if the eld congurations (x), solution of the klein-gordon
equation, with (x) = (x)/xo, satisfy the conditions:
1,3,lm(~k) = 0,
a) plm = r dki(~k)v(o)
and, in the case that i(~k) k0 k3+ with  > l + 1, also
b) qlm = r dki(~k)v(o)
2,3,lm(~k) = 0,
where the v(o)s are zero modes of d. the conditions a) are non void only for l  2 and are
called no supertranslations conditions in ref. [7]: when they are satised, the constants
of motion plm are functionally dependent on the momenta of the new canonical basis [when
they are not satised, the plm are independent constants of motion allowing the denition
of a bms algebra and this destroys the possibility of denining a unique poincare algebra
in a non ambigous way].

1,3,lm(~k)  r dkf (p, k)v(o)
2,3,lm(~k)  r dkf (p, k)v(o)

one has

let us remark that on the wigner hyperplane f (p, k) may be replaced with two scalar

of this equation by using the theory of pseudodierential operators] with both the energy
and the electric charge of the same sign: positive for a and negative for b.

like in the case of the foldy-wouthuysen transformation for particles of spin 1/2, also in
the spin 0 case the exact diagonalization of the hamiltonian cannot be achieved in presence

in ref. [11], it is shown that this hamiltonian cannot be diagonalized, because the sepa-
ration of positive and negative energies is inhibited by eects which (in a second quantized
formalism) can be ascribed to the vacuum polarization, namely to the pair production.
this (i.e. the nonseparability of positive and negative energies) is also the source of the
zitterbewegung eects for localized klein-gordon wave packets as discussed in ref. [11].
with an integration by parts, the constraint h( ) of eq.(8.32) can be rewritten as

if we suppose that (, ~) is normalized to r d3(, ~)3(, ~) = 1/m [this is a charge

normalization compatible with the nonlinear equations of motion, because the electric charge
is conserved], we can rewrite the previous formula as

tions of the form (, ~) = (, ~p)ei~p~ + 1(, ~) with 1 negligible, namely that the global

given in ref. [8] for the invariant mass of charged scalar particles plus the electromagnetic
eld, which was determined in ref. [1] for the two possible signs of the energy  =  [with
the grassmann charges qi replaced with |e|], when evaluated at ~ = ~i( ). under the
square root there is only a magnetic coupling to ~a: in this way the quoted problems of the
interconnession of electric elds with pair production are avoided. the klein-gordon self-
energy should go in the particle limit (eikonal approximation of eld theory) in the coulomb
self-energy of the classical particle, which is absent in ref. [1] because it is regularized by
assuming that the particle electric charge q is pseudoclassically described by grassmann
variables so that q2 = 0. therefore, the particle description of ref. [1] is valid only when
one disregards the eects induced by vacuum polarization and pair production and uses a
strong eikonal approximation neglecting diractive eects.
