abstract

we provide a new general setting for scalar interacting elds on the covering of a d + 1
dimensional ads spacetime. the formalism is used at rst to construct a one-parameter
family of eld theories, each living on a corresponding spacetime submanifold of ads, which is
a cylinder rsd1. we then introduce a limiting procedure which directly produces luscher-
mack cfts on the covering of the ads asymptotic cone. our ads/cft correspondence is
generally valid for interacting elds, and is illustrated by a complete treatment of two-point
functions, the case of klein-gordon elds appearing as particularly simple in our context.

we also show how the minkowskian representation of these boundary cfts can be
directly generated by an alternative limiting procedure involving minkowskian theories in
horocyclic sections (nowadays called (d1)branes, 3branes for ads5). these theories are
restrictions to the brane of the ambient ads eld theory considered. this provides a more
general correspondence between the ads eld theory and a poincare invariant qft on the
brane, satisfying all the wightman axioms. the case of two-point functions is again studied
in detail from this viewpoint as well as the cft limit on the boundary.

introduction

shortly after the appearance of maldacenas ads/cft conjecture [1], a proposal to make
it eective has been formulated independently in [2] and [3], and then discussed in a large
number of papers (for a review see [4]). the proposal prescribes a way to compute the
greens functions of the boundary cft in terms of the euclidean classical supergravity
action of an ads eld conguration which obeys to precise boundary conditions. most of
these works are thus making use of classical eld theory methods (mainly in a euclidean
formulation allowing the use of dirichlets problem but also in a lorentzian formulation in
terms of modes of the klein-gordon equation [5]).

however, since the ideas of the ads/cft conjecture suggest the existence of a rich
and still uninvestigated conceptual content at the level of quantum elds, it is natural that
more recent works in this domain have made use of the already existing (and more than
two decades old) results about quantum eld theory (qft) on the ads spacetime. in this
connection, one must quote the pioneering approach of [6], whose main concern was to specify
boundary conditions such that the diculties arising by the lack of global hyperbolicity of
the underlying ads manifold could be circumvented and the resulting qft be well dened.
another, earlier, approach was also given on the basis of group-theoretical methods [7]
following ideas that can be traced back to dirac [8].

both of these approaches have inuenced very much the recent research on the ads/cft
subject. however, their applicability is more or less limited to free ads qfts (even if they
can produce useful ingredients for perturbative calculations) and there is the need of setting
the ads/cft debate on a more general basis1 in which both ads quantum elds and
boundary cfts would be treated from the viewpoint of the structural properties of their
npoint correlation functions.
in a basic work by luscher and mack [11], the concept of global conformal invariance in
minkowskian qft has been associated in a deep and fruitful way with the general framework
of qft on the covering of a quadratic cone with signature (+, +,, ,) (in one dimension
more). since such a cone is precisely the asymptotic cone of the ads quadric, it seems quite
appropriate to try to formulate the ads/cft correspondence in a way which exhibits as
clearly as possible the connection between the previous conceptual qft framework on the
cone with a similar qft framework on the ads quadric. this is the rst purpose of the
present work.

in section 2 we introduce such a general framework for the study of quantum elds on a
(d+1)dimensional ads spacetime adsd+1 (or more precisely on its covering) in the spirit
of [12]. then, in section 3, we present a direct and simple method for obtaining correlation
functions of corresponding conformal elds on the boundary, method which does not rely
on the use of any eld equation. general interacting qfts on the (covering of the) ads
spacetime are assumed to satisfy a set of basic properties such as locality, ads covariance and
a certain energy spectrum condition formulated in terms of appropriate analyticity properties
of the n-point functions. together with these general properties, it is also crucial to require
a certain type of asymptotic behavior for the n-point functions in terms of an asymptotic
dimensionality condition. the possibility to use such type of asymptotic condition has been
mentioned in a perturbative context in [13]. we then introduce a limiting procedure which
directly produces cfts (in the sense of [11]) on the covering of the asymptotic cone of ads
spacetime; the conformal covariance of the corresponding minkowskian (interacting) eld
theory on the boundary is then proved without making use of any eld equation.

our approach therefore diers from the original largely followed proposals of [2] and [3]
in the sense that, rather solving explicitly for a eld that is dened by suitable boundary

1in this spirit such a setting has been proposed [9] in the general framework of algebras of local observables

(or local quantum physics in the sense of r. haag [10]).

conditions on the edge  which can be done in a tractable way only for free elds  we dene a
limiting procedure that can be applied directly to the ads correlation functions. this is much
simpler already for free elds, but our treatment also shows how to deal with interacting elds
adsd+1 and we gain a general non-perturbative foundation for the ads/cft conjecture,
formulated in terms of the npoint correlation functions of such elds and treated from a
model-independent point of view.
in section 4 we provide a complete treatment of two-point correlation functions. by
applying the general setting of section 2 we are able to exhibit strong analyticity properties
of ads two-point functions [14], which are closely similar to those enjoyed by two-point func-
tions in at spacetime or in de sitter spacetime [15, 16]. in the case of klein-gordon elds,
these analyticity properties x completely their form to be necessarily appropriate second-
kind legendre functions, as obtained (for the four-dimensional case) in the group-theoretical
approach of [7]; the cft limits of such two-point functions are then directly computable in
full consistency with the given general formulation of the ads/cft correspondence.

we also provide an alternative construction based on the poincare or horocyclic coordi-
nate system for adsd+1. this way of looking to the ads spacetime as a warped manifold
with poincare sections (today called d1 branes) has recently gained an enormous interest
in a phenomenological and cosmological context [17].
we show that by restriction, ads correlation functions satisfying our general properties
of section 2 dene acceptable two-point minkowskian qft correlation functions on the
branes (corresponding to at d-dimensional spacetime sections of the ads manifold).
in
particular, in section 5 we establish a spectral decomposition for the ads klein-gordon
elds naturally associated to the poincare foliation of the ads quadric. in this scheme the
well-known ambiguity for low mass theories [18] is seen to be linked to the lack of essential
self-adjointness of the bessels dierential operator [19] which naturally arises in the poincare
coordinates.

in the last part of our paper, we introduce a more general possible use of the poincare
foliation by showing how general minkowskian interacting qfts can be produced by taking
the restrictions of general ads qfts to the branes. moreover, by sending these leaves
to innity we exhibit a limiting procedure for the minkowskian qfts in the leaves which
provides an alternative presentation of the previously dened ads/cft correspondence.
the interest of this presentation is that it is entirely expressed in terms of minkowskian
theories satisfying the wightman axioms, and can be of interest for the multidimensional
approach to phenomenology and cosmology [17].

2 general qft in ads spacetime

2.1 notations and geometry

we consider the vector space rd+2 equipped with the following pseudo-scalar product:

x  x  = x 0x 0  x 1x 1    x dx d + x d+1x d+1 .

the (d + 1)-dimensional ads universe can then be identied with the quadric

where x 2 = x  x, endowed with the induced metric

adsd+1 = {x  rd+2, x 2 = r2},

ds2

ads = (cid:16)dx 0 2

 dx 1 2

  + dx d+1 2(cid:17)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)adsd+1

.

the ads relativity group is g = so0(2, d), that is the component connected to the identity of
the pseudo-orthogonal group o(2, d). two events x, x  of adsd+1 are space-like separated
if (x  x )2 < 0, i.e. if x  x  > r2.

3

we will also consider the complexication of adsd+1:

ads(c)

d+1 = {z = x + iy  cd+2, z 2 = r2}.

(4)

in other terms, z = x + iy belongs to ads(c)
in the following we will put for notational simplicity r = 1.

d+1 if and only if x 2  y 2 = r2 and x  y = 0.

we shall make use of two parametrizations for the ads manifold.

the covering parametrization x = x[r, , e]: it is obtained by intersecting adsd+1 with
the cylinders with equation {x 02 + x d+12

= r2 + 1}, and is given by

i = 1, ..., d

(5)

= r2 + 1 sin 
x 0
x i
= rei
x d+1 = r2 + 1 cos 



+ . . . + ed2

with e2  e12

+ x d+12

= 1 and r  0. for each xed value of r, the corresponding slice
cr = adsd+1  {x 02
(6)

= r2 + 1}
of adsd+1 is a manifold s1  sd1. the complexied space ads(c)
d+1 is obtained by giving
arbitrary complex values to r,  and to the coordinates e = (ei) on the unit (d  1)sphere.
the parametrization (5) allows one to introduce relevant coverings of adsd+1 and ads(c)
d+1
by unfolding the 2periodic coordinate  (resp. re  ), interpreted as a time-parameter:
(c)
d+1. a privileged fundamental
sheet is dened on these coverings by imposing the condition  <  <  (resp.  <
re  < ). this procedure also associates with each manifold cr its covering cr which is a
cylinder r  sd1e. we will use the symbols x, z, ..., also to denote points of the coverings.
similarly one introduces a covering g of the group g by taking in g the universal covering

these coverings are denoted respectively by dadsd+1 and dads

the requirement of nonexistence of closed time-loops, also leads us to specify the notion of

respectively generated by the action of g and g on the base point b = (0, . . . , 0, 1) .

of the rotation subgroup in the (0, d + 1)plane. by transitivity, adsd+1 and dads d+1 are
the physical reason which motivates the introduction of the covering dadsd+1, that is
space-like separation in dadsd+1 as follows: let x, x   dadsd+1 and let g an element of g
x and x  are spacelike separated if xg is in the fundamental sheet of dadsd+1 and (x 

x )2  (g1x  g1x )2 < 0. this implies that xg = xg[r, , e] with  <  <  and
r2 + 1 cos  > 1.
it is also interesting to note that on each manifold cr the condition of space-like separation
between two points x = x[r, , e] and x  = x [r,  , e] reads (in view of (5):

such that x  = gb; dene xg = g1x.

(x  x )2 = 2(r2 + 1)(1  cos(   ))  r2(e  e)2 < 0,

(7)

and that the corresponding covering manifold cr therefore admits a global causal ordering
which is specied as follows:

(, e) > ( , e)

i     > 2arcsin(cid:18) (e  e)2

(8)

the horocyclic parametrization x = x(v, x): it only covers the part  of the ads manifold
which belongs to the half-space {x d + x d+1 > 0} of the ambient space and is obtained by

(9)

in each slice v, x0, ..., xd1 can be seen as coordinates of an event of a d-dimensional
minkowski spacetime md with metric ds2
(here and in
the following where it appears, an index m stands for minkowski). this explains why the
horocyclic coordinates (v, x) of the parametrization (9) are also called poincare coordinates.
the scalar product (1) and the ads metric can then be rewritten as follows:

m = dx0 2  dx1 2  . . .  dxd1 2

x  x  = cosh(v  v)

eq. (10) implies that

(x(v, x)  x(v, x))2 = e2v(x  x)2.

(10)

(11)

(12)

this in turn implies that space-like separation in any slice v can be understood equivalently
in the minkowskian sense of the slice itself or in the sense of the ambient ads universe.

eq. (11) exhibits the region  of adsd+1 as a warped product [23] with warping function
(v) = ev and bers conformal to md. the use of this parametrization is crucial in a
recent approach to the mass hierarchy problem [17] and to multidimensional cosmology.
in this context the slices v are called branes. finally, the representation of  by the
parametrization (5) is specied by considering  as embedded in the fundamental sheet of

  <  < ;

dadsd+1; it is therefore described by the following conditions on the coordinates r, , e:

red +pr2 + 1 cos  > 0
d+1 is the set of all points z = x + iy in dads

(c)

the euclidean submanifold ed+1 of dads

(c)
d+1
such that x = (0, x 1, ..., x d+1), y = (y 0, 0, ..., 0) and x d+1 > 0. it is therefore represented
by the upper sheet (characterized by the condition x d+1 > 0) of the two-sheeted hyperboloid
with equation x d+12
= 1. ed+1 is equally well represented in both
parametrizations (5) and (9) as follows:

(13)

z = z[r,  = i, e];

(r, , e)  r  r  sd1

or

z = z(v, (iy0, x1, ..., xd1)); v  r, (y0, x1, ..., xd1))  rd.

for each v, the complexication (c)

in view of (14), ed+1 is contained in the fundamental sheet of dads

v of the horosphere v is parametrized by formulae
(6) in which x is replaced by the complex minkowskian vector z = x + iy = (z0, ..., zd); the
euclidean submanifold of this complex minkowskian manifold is obtained as the intersection
(c)
v  ed+1.

(c)
d+1.

(14)

(15)

2the coordinate u = ev is frequently called z in the recent literature. we are forced to change this notation
because we reserve the letter z to complex quantities. by allowing also negative values for u the coordinate system
(9) covers almost all the real manifold adsd+1.

2.2 quantum field theory

to one scalar eld (x). according to the general reconstruction procedure [12], a theory is
completely determined by the set of all n-point vacuum expectation values (or wightman
functions) of the eld , given as distributions on the corresponding product manifolds

let us consider now a general qft on dadsd+1; for simplicity we limit the present discussion
(dads d+1)n:

these distributions are supposed to be tempered when represented in the variables of the
covering parametrization xj = xj[rj, j, ej] and to satisfy a set of general requirements
which we will specify below.

wn(x1, . . . xn) = h, (x1) . . . (xn)i.

(16)

before doing it, we remark that a qft on dadsd+1 can be projected to a theory on

adsd+1 itself if it is 2periodic in the time-parameter  , namely if each wn(x1, . . . xn) is
invariant under all individual substitutions xj[rj, j , ej]  xj[rj , j + 2, ej].
an important class of elds, which can be explicitly constructed in a fock space, is the
class of generalized free elds; these elds are completely determined by their two-point
function w2(x1, x2). in particular, the klein-gordon elds are those for which w2(x1, x2)
satises the corresponding eld equation w.r.t. both points. of course there are in general
innitely many inequivalent solutions to this problem (encoded in the choice of w2) and one
has to select the meaningful ones on the basis of some physical principle; the existence of
many possible theories even for a free eld of a given mass is no surprise.

we shall assume that the distributions wn satisfy the following properties: ads invari-
ance, positive-deniteness, hermiticity, local commutativity, analyticity corresponding to an
appropriate spectral condition and dimensional boundary conditions at innity.

the requirement of ads invariance (corresponding to the scalar character of the eld) can
be written as follows:

wn(gx1, . . . gxn) = wn(x1, . . . xn)

for any g  g.

(17)

the usual positivity and hermiticity properties [12] are valid for scalar qfts on any space-
time and we do not spell them out.

a) local commutativity. (x) commutes (as an operator-valued distribution) with (x ) for

x, x  space-like separated in the sense of the covering space dadsd+1, as dened above (for

theories in adsd+1 itself, it implies commutativity under the only condition (x  x )2 < 0,
which then includes a certain condition of commutativity at periodic time-like separations).
as in the minkowskian case, this postulate is equivalent to the coincidence of permuted
wightman functions at space-like separation of consecutive arguments xj, xj+1 [12].

b) analyticity corresponding to energy spectrum condition. since the parameter of the cover-
ing group of the rotations in the (0, d + 1)plane is interpreted as a genuine time-translation
for the observers in all the corresponding killing trajectories, and since the complexications

of these trajectories do not exhibit any geometrical periodicity3 in dads

(c)
d+1, it is legitimate
to consider qfts for which the corresponding innitesimal generator j0,d+1 is represented
by a self-adjoint operator whose spectrum is bounded from below: the latter postulate is
in fact interpretable as a reasonable spectral condition on the energy, valid for all these ob-
servers. by using the standard laplace transform argument [12, 32] in the corresponding
time-variables 1, ..., n, one is led to formulate this spectral condition by the following ana-
lyticity property of the wightman functions:

3such geometrical periodicity in purely imaginary times gives rise to thermal eects for the corresponding

observers, as it has already been checked in various examples of qft on curved spacetimes [24, 25, 26, 16].

6

(c)
d+1; zj = zj[rj, j , ej];

each tempered distribution wn(x1[r1, 1, e1], ..., xn[rn, n, en]) is the boundary value of a
holomorphic function wn(z1, ..., zn) which is dened in a complex neighborhood of the set
im 1 < im 2 <  <

{z = (z1, ..., zn); zj = xj + iyj  dads
im n}.
as a by-product, the schwinger function sn, that is the restriction of each wn to the eu-
clidean submanifold {(z1, ..., zn)  (ed+1)n; 1 < 2 <  < n}, is well-dened.
c) dimensional boundary conditions at innity. in order to obtain relevant qfts on the
boundary of ads spacetime (see section 3), we are led to postulate a certain type of power-
decrease at innity for the wightman functions which we call dimensional boundary con-
ditions at innity; such conditions can be shown to be valid in the case of klein-gordon
elds (see section 4).

dimension  if the following limits exist in the sense of distributions:

by making use of the coordinates (5) we say that a qft on dadsd+1 is of asymptotic

limmin(r1,...,rn)+ (r1  rn)wn(x1[r1, 1, e1], ..., xn[rn, n, en])

(18)

= w 

n ([1, e1], ..., [n, en])

j=1

we have to show that the above condition is meaningful, since it is not true in general that

crj of (dadsd+1)n

a distribution wn(x1, . . . xn) can be restricted to the submanifoldqn

(cr was dened in eq. (6)). our spectral condition b) implies that this can be done in the
present framework. in fact, for each xed r1, ..., rn and e1, ..., en, the existence of an analytic
continuation wn of wn in the variables 1, ..., n of the covering parametrization (5) in the
tube domain tn = {(1, ..., n); im 1 < im 2 <  < im n} implies that the boundary
value of wn on the reals from this tube is a distribution in the variables 1, ..., n on each
leaf obtained by xing all the parameters rj and ej and that it is even a regular (namely
c) function of all these leaf parameters. the limit in eq. (18) is therefore also dened as
a distribution in the variables 1, ..., n with c dependence with respect to the variables
ej. moreover, it is then natural to assume that the limit in eq.(18) can be extrapolated to
the holomorphic functions wn in their tube domains tn so that the corresponding limits
w 
n as
their boundary values on the reals. by restricting all these holomorphic functions to the
euclidean manifolds j = ij, j = 1, ..., n, one then obtains a similar condition for the
schwinger functions sn and the corresponding limits s
n .

n are themselves holomorphic in tn and admit the corresponding distributions w 

if one wishes to select qfts satisfying the property of uniqueness of the vacuum, one should
supplement the previous requirements by an appropriate cluster property on the npoint
functions. in order to obtain a relevant cluster property for the corresponding luscher-mack

conformal cluster property described in [11]), one should formulate here a similar cluster

cft on the cone bc2,d obtained by the procedure described in our next section (namely the
property on the schwinger functions on dads

as a special application of the previous framework, it is meaningful to consider the restric-

of (cid:16)dadsd+1(cid:17)n

(i.e. to the case
when all variables rj are equal to r). one then notices that the positivity conditions sat-

tions of the distributions wn to the submanifolds (cid:16) cr(cid:17)n
ised by assumption by the distributions wn on dadsd+1 can be extended to test-functions
given eld on dadsd+1 yields by restriction a well-dened quantum eld r(, e). this eld is

of the variables j and ej localized in these submanifolds r1 =  = rn = r. in view of
the standard reconstruction procedure [12], this allows one to say that in each slice cr the

obviously invariant under the product of the translation group with time-parameter  by the
orthogonal group so(d) of space transformations acting on the sphere sd1 of the variables
e. moreover, it follows from the locality postulate a) together with eqs. (7) and (8) that the
eld r also satises local commutativity in the sense of the spacetime manifold cr. finally,
in view of b), the npoint functions of r are (for each r) boundary values of holomorphic
functions of the complex variables 1, ..., n in the tube tn, which shows that these theories
satisfy a spectral condition with respect to the generator of time-translations.

3 correspondence with conformal eld theories on bc2,d
`a la luscher-mack
we shall now introduce the asymptotic cone c2,d (resp. c(c)
and wish to identify the limit (in the sense of eq. (18)) of a qft on dadsd+1 satisfying the
previous properties with a qft on the corresponding covering bc2,d of c2,d. to do this, we
rst notice that by adapting the covering parametrization (5) of dads d+1 to the case of its
asymptotic cone, c2,d = { = (0, ..., (d+1)); 02  12    d2

= 0}, one readily
obtains the following parametrization (with the same notations as [11], but in dimension
d + 2):

and c(c)
2,d. by again unfolding the 2periodic coordinate  (resp. re  ). a privileged
fundamental sheet is dened on these coverings by imposing the condition  <  < 
(resp.  < re  < ).
we also note that the standard condition of space-like separation on c2,d is similar to the
condition chosen on the ads spacetime, namely

(  )2 = r2"4(cid:18)sin(cid:18)    
and yields the corresponding global causal ordering on bc2,d

equivalently written e.g. in [11] as     > arccos(e  e). note that in the space of variables
(,  , e, e), the region described by eq.(22) is exactly the limit of the region given by eq.(8)
when r tends to innity.

by taking the intersection of c2,d with the family of hyperplanes with equation d+d+1 =

ev, one obtains the analogue of the horocyclic parametrization (9), namely:

which implies the following identity (similar to (10)) between quadratic forms:

by taking eqs.

(20) into account, one then sees that these formulae correspond (in
dimension d) to the embedding of minkowski space into the covering of the cone c2,d (see
[27] and references therein), namely one has (in view of the identication d + d+1 = ev =

ads invariance together with the properties a),b) and c) described in the previous section.
in view of c), we can associate with the latter the following set of npoint distributions

let us now consider a general qft on dadsd+1 whose wightman functions wn satisfy
fwn(1, ..., n) on bc2,d:
at rst, one can check that the set of distributions fwn satisfy the required positivity condi-
tions for dening a qft on bc2,d. this is because, in view of postulate c) (applied with all rj

equal to the same r), the distributions w 
n appear as the limits of the n-point functions of

by the latter are then preserved in the limit, in terms of test-functions of the variables j and

clear that, if the original schwinger functions on the complexied ads space satisfy the

we are now going to establish that the ginvariance (17) of the ads npoint functions,
together with the properties a), b), c), imply the conformal invariance of the eld o(); more
precisely, we wish to show that the wightman functions fwn of this eld are invariant under
the action on bc2,d of the group g, now interpreted as in [11] as the quantum mechanical

conformal group, namely that one has:

for all g in g.

fwn(g1, ..., gn) = fwn(1, ..., n)

a part of this invariance is trivial in view of the limiting procedure of c):

it is the
invariance under the rotations in the (0, d + 1)plane (i.e.
the translations in the time
variables  ) and the invariance under the spatial orthogonal group of the subspace of variables
(1, ..., d) (acting on the sphere sd1).

in order to show that the invariance condition (28) holds for all g in g, it remains to
show that it holds for all one-parameter subgroups of pseudo-rotations in the (0, i)planes
and in the (i, d + 1)planes of coordinates, with i = 1, ..., d. let us consider the rst case
with e.g. i = 1 and associate with the corresponding subgroup g0,1 of pseudo-rotations the
following parametrizations x = x{, , u} and  = {, , u} (with u = (u2, ..., ud+1)) of

for g  g0,1, the invariance condition (28) to be proven can be written as follows (with the

for all real a. now in view of the denition (27) of fwn(j ) and of the relations between the

sets of parameters (r, , e) and (, , u) obtained by identication of the expressions (20) and

now it is easily seen that in the latter, the limit can be taken separately in each term and
that the resulting equality yields precisely the required covariance relation (32) for w 
n .
although the previous formulae have been written in terms of the distributions wn and
of their asymptotic forms, one could reproduce the argument in a completely rigorous way

11

[14] in terms of the functions wn in the tube domains tn of the variables j , all the functions
involved being then of class c with respect to all the variables (j , j, uj) and all the
limits being taken in the sense of regular functions; the covariance relations on the reals
will then be obtained as relations for the corresponding boundary values (in the sense of
distributions). the treatment of the covariance with respect to the pseudo-rotation groups
gi,d+1 is completely similar.

we can then summarize the results of this section by the following statement:

the procedure we have described (expressed by eqs. (18) and (27)) displays a general ads/cft
correspondence for qfts:

(x)  o()

(39)

whose wightman functions satisfy the properties a),b),c), and a conformally invariant local

between a scalar (ads invariant) quantum eld (x) on the covering dadsd+1 of adsd+1
eld o() on the covering bc2,d of the cone c2,d, enjoying the luscher-mack spectral condition;
the degree of homogeneity (dimension)  of o() is equal to the asymptotic dimension of
the ads eld (x).

of course, from this general point of view, the correspondence may a priori be many-to-
one. finally, according to the formalism described in [11, 27], the correspondence (39) can
be completed by saying that there exists a unique conformal (minkowskian) local eld o(x)
n are expressed in terms of those of o() by
of dimension  whose npoint functions w m
the following formulae:
n (x1, ..., xn) = e(v1++vn) fwn(1, ..., n) = 1jn(d

in the latter, the minkowskian variables xj are expressed in terms of the cone variables j
by inverting (23), which yields:

4.1 the analytic structure of two-point functions on the ads space-
time

it turns out that in all eld theories on dadsd+1 satisfying the general requirements described

in subsection 2.2, the two-point function enjoys maximal analyticity properties in all the
coordinates, as it is the case for the minkowski [12] and de sitter cases [16]. a full proof
of these results will be found in [14]. we shall only give here a descriptive account of
them, needed for further applications. since, in particular, ads covariance and the energy
spectrum condition b) of sec 2.2 are responsible for this maximal analytic structure and
since (as seen below) the latter determines completely satisfactory solutions for the case
of klein-gordon ads elds, we shall consider this general class of two-point functions as
preferred.

there are two distinguished complex domains [14] of ads(c)

d+1, invariant under real ads
transformations, which are of crucial importance for a full understanding of the structures
associated with two-point functions. they are given by:

t + = {z = x + iy  ads(c)
t  = {z = x + iy  ads(c)

d+1; y 2 > 0, (z) = +1},
d+1; y 2 > 0, (z) = 1},

(42)

12

where

(43)
m and t 
t + and t  are the ads version of the usual forward and backward tubes t +
m
of complex minkowski spacetime, obtained in correspondence with the energy-momentum
spectrum condition [12]; let us recall their denition (in arbitrary spacetime dimension p):

(z) = sign(y 0x d+1  x 0y d+1).

m = {z = x + iy  mp(c); y2 > 0, y0 > 0},
t +
m = {z = x + iy  mp(c); y2 > 0, y0 < 0}.
t 

(44)

in the same way as these minkowskian tubes are generated by the action of real lorentz trans-
formations on the at (one complex time-variable) domains {z = x + iy; y = (y0,~0); y0 >
0 (resp. y0 < 0)}, the domains (42) of ads(c)
d+1 are generated by the action of the group g
on the at domains obtained by letting  vary in the half-planes im  > 0 or im  < 0 and
keeping r and e real in the covering parametrization (5) of the ads quadric. in fact, by using
the complex extension of this parametrization and putting r = sinh( + i),  = re  + i
one can represent the domains (42) by the following semi-tubes (invariant under translations
in the variable re  ):

 sinh  >" (sin )2 +(cid:0)(cosh )2  (cos )2(cid:1) (im e)2

m and z  t +

together imply the following

m . an analogous property also holds for n-point functions.

this representation (which clearly contains the previously mentioned at domains) can be
thought of, either as representing the domains (42) of ads(c) if  is identied to  + 2, or
d+1, which we denote by t + and t , if one does

(c)

coverings of the latter embedded in dads
one typical property of wightmans qft [12] is that any two-point distribution wm (x, x)
satisfying the spectral condition is the boundary value of a function wm (z, z) holomorphic
for z  t 
it is a consequence of ads invariance together with the spectrum assumption b) [14] that,
also in the ads spacetime, general two-point functions can be characterized by the following
global analyticity property which plays the role of a ginvariant spectral condition:
b(inv)) normal analyticity condition for two-point functions: the two-point function w (x, x )
is the boundary value of a function w (z, z ) which is holomorphic in the domain t   t +
of dads
in the fundamental sheet of dads
maximal analyticity property: w() is analytic in the covering b of the cut-plane

a further use of ads invariance implies that w (z, z ) is actually a function w() of a single
complex variable ; this variable  can be identied with z  z  when z and z  are both
(c)
d+1; ads invariance and the normal analyticity condition

 = {c \ [1, 1]}.
for special theories which are periodic in the time coordinate  , w() is in fact analytic
in  itself. one can now introduce all the usual green functions. the permuted wight-
man function w(x , x) = h, (x )(x)i is the boundary value of w (z, z ) from the
domain {(z, z ) : z  t +, z   t }. the commutator function is then c(x, x ) =
w(x, x )  w(x , x). the retarded propagator r(x, x ) is introduced by splitting the
support of the commutator c(x, x ) as follows

(c)
d+1.

(c)

d+1  dads

r(x, x ) = i(   )c(x, x ),

(46)

13

the other green functions are then dened in terms of r by the usual formulae: the advanced
propagator is given by a = r  ic while the chronological propagator is given by f =
ia + w.
note nally that, as a function of the single variable  = x  x , the jump iw() of iw()
across its cut (, +1] coincides with the retarded propagator r(x, x ) (or the advanced
one); in the periodic (i.e. true ads) case, the support of w reduces to the compact interval
[1, +1].

4.2 the simplest example revisited: klein-gordon elds in the
ads/cft correspondence

the wightman functions of elds satisfying the klein-gordon equation adsd+1

display the simplest example of the previous analytic structure:

(cid:3)ads + m2 = 0.

w (z, z ) = w () =

(48)

here q is a second-kind legendres function4 [28]; the parameter  is linked to the elds
mass by the relation

2 =

+ m2.

(49)

d2
4

and the normalization of w is chosen by imposing the short-distance hadamard behavior.
since w (z, z ) and w (z, z ) are solutions of the same klein-gordon equation (and
share the same analyticity properties), the question arises if these wightman function both
dene acceptable qfts on adsd+1. the answer [18] is that only theories with   1
are acceptable and there are therefore two regimes: for  > 1 there is only one eld theory
corresponding to a given mass while for || < 1 there are two theories. the case  = 1 is a
limit case. eq. (48) shows clearly that the only dierence between the theories parametrized
by opposite values of  is in their large distance behavior. more precisely, in view of eq.
(3.3.1.4) of [28], we can write:

w () = w () +

(50)

now we notice that in this relation (where all terms are solutions of the same klein-gordon
equation) the last term is regular on the cut   [1, 1]. this entails (reintroducing the ads
radius r) that, in the two theories, the cnumber commutator [(x), (x )] takes the same
value for all (time-like separated) vectors (x, x ) such that |x  x | < r2. therefore we can
say that the two theories represent the same algebra of local observables at short distances
(with respect to the radius r). but since the last term in the latter relation grows the faster
the larger is || (see [28] eqs. (3.9.2)), we see that the two theories drastically dier by their
long range behaviors.
the existence of the two regimes above has given rise to two distinct treatments of the
ads/cft correspondence in the two cases [29] and symmetry breaking had been advocated
to explain the dierence.

4this is the way these wightman functions were rst written in [7] for the four dimensional case d = 3.
their identication with secondkind legendre functions is worth being emphasized, in place of their less specic
(although exact) introduction under the general label of hypergeometric functions, used in recent papers. in fact
legendre functions are basically linked to the geometry of the ds and ads quadrics from both grouptheoretical
and complex analysis viewpoints [20, 16, 21, 22]

14

in the present context, by applying the correspondence as given in eq. (39), the two
regimes can be treated in one stroke. indeed, eq. (3.9.2.21) of [28] reports the following
large  behavior of the legendres function q (valid for any complex ):

(51)

it follows that the two-point function (48) and thereby all the npoint functions of the
corresponding klein-gordon eld satisfy the dimensional boundary conditions at innity
with dimension  = d

(see also [30]). this equation expresses nothing more than the behavior of the previous
legendres function at innity. not only all the s are treated this way in one stroke but,
also, one can study the boundary limit for theories corresponding to  < 1, even if the
corresponding qft may have no direct physical interpretation.

(53)

correspondingly, we can deduce from (53) the expression of the two-point function of the
associated minkowskian eld on md, given by formula (40); by taking eq.(24) into account,
we obtain:

 (z, z) = e(v+v)( d

in the latter, the poincare coordinates z and z must be taken with the usual iprescription
(im z0 < im z0), which can be checked to be implied by the spectral condition b) of section
2 through the previous limiting procedure.

we note that this natural way of producing the boundary eld theory gives rise to the
normalization advocated in [29], eq. (2.21) (apart from a trivial factor 4, which does not
depend on the anomalous dimension  = d

2 + ).

let us now describe how the previous limiting procedure looks in the poincare coordinates
(9). these coordinates oer the possibility of studying directly the boundary behavior of
the ads wightman functions in a larger domain of the complex ads spacetime. this fact is
based on the following simple observation: consider the parametrization (9) for two points
with complex parameters specied by

z = z(v, z),
z  = z (v, z),

v  r, z  t 
m
v  r, z  t +
m .

(55)

it is easy to check that this choice of parameters implies that z  t  and z   t +. it
follows that, given an ads invariant two-point function satisfying locality and the normal
analyticity condition b(inv)), the following restriction automatically generates a local and

15

(poincare) covariant two-point function on the slice v, which satises the spectral condition
[12] (in short: the two-point function of a general wightman qft):

w m

{v}(z, z) = w (z(v, z), z (v, z)) .

(56)

on the basis of the dimensional boundary condition (18), and of the fact (obtained by
comparing (5) and (9)) that ev
r2 cos  + ed tends to the nite limit cos  + ed when
r tends to innity, one sees that the following limit exists and that it yields (in view of (27)
and (40)):

r =q1 + 1

lim

v+

e2vw m

{v}(z, z) = w m (z, z).

(57)

the limiting two-point function w m (z, z) then automatically exhibits locality, poincare
invariance and the spectral condition. (the invariance under special conformal transforma-
tions and scaling property would necessitate a special check, but they result from the general
statement of conformal invariance of the limiting eld o() proved in section 3 completed
by the analysis of [11]).
2 + ),
the latter presentation of the limiting procedure gives immediately the result obtained in
eq.(54) but in a larger complex domain:

when applied to the wightman functions of klein-gordon elds (i.e. with  = d

in a completely similar way one can compute the bulktoboundary correlation function

5 decomposition of ads klein-gordon elds to the branes

we will discuss in this section a decomposition of klein-gordon elds associated with the
poincare coordinate system (9). this will produce some new and exact formulae which
exhibit how a eld of a given mass on the ambient ads spacetime is decomposed into ele-
mentary massive elds when restricted to the brane. we will also gain insight about the two
dierent ads regimes depending on the values of of the mass parameter . we follow here
a method already used in [31].

according to eq. (56), we can obtain by restriction poincare invariant qfts on the
branes v of adsd+1. of course the restricted theories are not conformal and can become
conformal only in the limit v  .
gordon equation (47) is separated into the following pair of equations:

let us study the case of klein-gordon elds. by using the coordinates (9) the klein-

(cid:3)m  +  = 0,

e2v(cid:2)(v) + d (v)  m2(v)(cid:3) = (v).

operator. the separation constant  is for the moment unrestricted. to get information on
the allowed values for  we have to consider eq. (61) as a spectral problem in a suitable
hilbert space. to this end let us introduce the hilbert space l2(r, e(d2)vdv), where the
dierential operator dened in eq. (61) is symmetric. it is useful to pass to the variable
u = ev already introduced in eq. (9) and dene f (u) = (v)e

following [19], pag. 88 , we learn that there are two distinct regimes corresponding as

g(u) =z 

0

d f(u)z 

0

f(u)g(u)du , g  l2(r+, du)) .

(64)

when 0   < 1 both solutions u1/2j(u) and u1/2j (u) are square integrable in the

neighborhood of u = 0 and must be taken into consideration: we are in the socalled limit
circle case at zero [19, 32], which implies that the operator is not essentially selfadjoint and
there exists a s1 ambiguity in the selfadjoint extensions we can perform. the freedom is
exactly in the choice of the boundary conditions at u = 0 (corresponding to the boundary of
ads).
now we have a oneparameter family of eigenfunctions:

f ()

 (u) r u

2(cid:0)2  2 cos() + 2(cid:1) 1

2h j( u)   j( u)i ,

to which we must add one bound state when  > 0:

bound(u) r2

(65)

(66)

the possible choices of the parameter  do correspond to dierent selfadjoint extensions
of the dierential operator (62). to each such extension there is associated a domain d()
also depending on the parameter  [32]. to construct d() consider the one dimensional
subspaces h spanned by the eigenfunctions solving eq. (62) with eigenvalues i:

f(u)  uk(e i

4 u) ;

(67)

both these functions are square-integrable when 0   < 1. each extension is in onetoone
correspondence with partial isometries u : h+ 7 h, namely in this case with elements
of u (1)  s1. the domain of the extension is obtained by adjoining to the original domain
the l2 element

of symmetry the subspace (cid:0)idh+ + u(cid:1) h+: here it means that we have to add the span of

f(u)  f+(u) + eif(u) .

17

which has in our case the asymptotics

as usual these functions do not belong to l2(r+, du) but any wavepacket does; moreover
any such wave packet has this asymptotics. this allows us to nd which parameter  cor-
responds to which unitary operator ei : h+ 7 h, i.e. to a specic selfadjoint extension.
indeed, by matching the asymptotics in eqs. (68) with that in eq. (69) we obtain

the reason why we must use dierent selfadjoint extensions is that w d+1
as a function of v (or v) belongs to d() when   [0, 1) while it belongs to d(0) when
  (1, 0): this can be proved directly by studying the asymptotics.
the three eqs. (70) are thus summarized into the following formula valid for the whole

with, again, u = ev. the full details of the proof include analytical continuation to the
euclidean section where  = (z  z)2 > 0, and take into account formula (12) pag. 64 in
[33].
eq.
(70) can also been inverted and we obtain the minkowski klein-gordon two-point
function on the slice v by integrating w against the eigenfunctions . for instance, when
 > 1 this corresponds to the introduction of the elds (x) on the minkowskian slice v

obtained by smearing the ads klein-gordon eld b with the complete set of modes (72):

(x(v, x))(v)e(d2)vdv.

(75)

(x) =z 



it can be shown that the eld (x) is a canonical minkowskian kleingordon eld in the
wightman vacuum state. in precise terms, we have that the ads vacuum expectation value
of (x) is given by

w, (x, x)  h|(x) (x)|i = (  )w m,d



(z, z).

(76)

in particular, the elds  have zero correlation (and hence commute) for dierent values of
the square mass .

the results of this section can be used to construct other twopoint functions w d+1,()
(z(v, z), z(v, z)) for a kleingordon eld on ads by using the other selfadjoint extensions:
however it is not guaranteed that such w d+1,()
can be extended to the other half of ads
since the denition uses the set of coordinates dened only on one half. moreover one should
prove (or disprove) the ads invariance and analyticity properties of such states. we will not
go any further in this direction in this paper.





6 general qfts in the poincare coordinates

the results of section 4 and section 5 suggest the following alternative approach to the
ads/cft correspondence. starting from a given set of ads invariant n-point functions
satisfying general requirements of the form described in section 2, it is (at least formally)
possible to obtain a set of poincare invariant (see below) n-point functions in one-dimension
less by taking the following restrictions:

w m

n{v}(x1, . . . , xn) = wn (x1(v, x1), . . . xn(v, xn)) .

(77)

on the basis of the requirement of asymptotic dimensionality c) supplemented by an argu-
ment similar to the one given in section 4.2 (based on eqs. (27) and (40)) for justifying
the limit (57) of two-point functions in the slices v, npoint correlation functions on the
boundary will be obtained by taking the following limits:
envw m
one can also consider a many-leaf restriction as follows:

n (x1, . . . , xn) = lim
v

n{v}(x1, . . . , xn)

w m

(78)

wn{vm+1,...,vn}(x1, . . . , xm, xm+1, . . . , xn) =
= wn (x1, . . . xm, xm+1(vm+1, xm+1), . . . , xn(vn, xn)) ,

(79)

and get various bulk-to boundary correlation functions by taking the limit as before:

wn(x1, . . . , xm, xm+1, . . . , xn) =

19

lim

vm+1,...,vn

e(vm+1++vn)wn{vm+1,...,vn}(x1, . . . , xm, xm+1, . . . , xn).

(80)

restricting ourselves here to the limiting procedure described by eq. (78), we then see that
the general ads/cft correspondence for qfts described in section 3 can alternatively be
presented purely in terms of a limit of minkowskian elds, denoted as follows:

(x)  {v(x)}  o(x),

(81)

where each eld v(x) is the scalar minkowskian eld whose npoint correlation functions
are those given by (77).
here we must point out that there is a substantial dierence between two-point and
npoint functions. in fact, in view of their maximal analyticity property (see section 4.2) the
two-point functions admit restrictions to the slices v which are themselves boundary values
of holomorphic functions in relevant minkowskian complex domains of the corresponding
complexied slices (c)
in this case there is therefore no problem of restriction of the
v :
distribution w2 to v  v.
as regards the npoint correlation functions, the existence of the restrictions (77) as
distributions on (v)n is not an obvious consequence of the requirements a), b), c) of section
2. only the existence of the corresponding restrictions at euclidean points of ((c)
v )n
(namely the schwinger functions of these minkowskian theories) are direct consequences
of the spectral condition b) we have assumed: this is because changing  into i in (5)
or changing x0 into iy0 in (9), all other parameters being kept real, yield two equivalent

(c)
d+1.

representations of the euclidean points of dads

as a matter of fact, in order to be able to dene the restrictions (77) as distributions en-
joying the full structure of minkowskian npoint functions, namely as distribution boundary
values of holomorphic functions in relevant domains of ((c)
v )n, one is led to use instead of
b) an alternative spectral condition in which the positivity of the spectrum refers to the rep-
resentation of a ddimensional abelian subgroup of g playing the role of the minkowskian
translation group with respect to the slices v.
let us briey sketch the construction. using the horocyclic parametrization of eq. (9),
we can lift the action of the poincare group as follows. consider the standard action of the
poincare group on the minkowski spacetime coordinates: x = 
 x +a,  = 0, 1, . . . , d1.
by plugging this relation into eq. (9) we promptly obtain the following relation:

 x  + (x d + x d+1)a

a2

2(cid:19) x d + a
2(cid:19) x d+1  a

 x  + x d+1 a2
2
 x   x d a2

a2

,

(82)

where greek indices are raised and lowered with the standard minkowski metric. in matrix
form we get

among such transformations there is the abelian subgroup of poincare translations g(i, a).

of these transformations form an abelian algebra. the ads spectral condition b) of section
2 should then be supplemented by the following one:

b) spectral condition: the innitesimal generators p  are represented by (commuting) self-
adjoint operators whose joint spectrum is contained in the forward light-cone v + = {pp 
0, p0  0} of a d-dimensional minkowski momentum space.
by using a laplace transform argument [12, 32], in the corresponding vector variables x1, ..., xn
one can see that this spectral condition implies the following analyticity property of the wight-
man functions:

analyticity corresponding to the spectrum of poincare translations: each ads distribution
wn (x1(v1, x1),. . . ,xn(vn,xn)) is the boundary value of a holomorphic function wn(z1(v1, z1),
..., zn(vn, zn)) which is dened in the tube
tn = {z = (z1, ..., zn)  ads(c)

d+1; zj = zj(vj , zj); v1, . . . , vn  r,
im (zj+1  zj)  v +, j = 1, . . . , n  1}.

(85)

property b) implies in particular that it is meaningful to consider the restricted distributions
w m
n{v} follows immediately by eq. (82).
furthermore, the positive-deniteness of this family of distributions is induced as before by

n{v} given in eq. (77). the poincare invariance of w m

validity of the euclidean cluster property for w m
n{v} is equivalent to the condition introduced
earlier in eq. (19). under these conditions the reconstruction procedure is now justied and

the analogous property satised by the distributions wn on dads d+1. we also note that the
the given eld on dadsd+1 yields by restriction a well-dened quantum eld v(x).

moreover, it follows from the locality postulate a) together with eqs. (12) that the eld
v also satises standard local commutativity in v. finally, in view of b), the npoint
functions of v are (for each v) boundary values of holomorphic functions in the tube do-
mains t m
n of wightmans qft. this shows that these theories satisfy a standard energy-
momentum spectrum condition (with respect to the generators of spacetime translations).
the conformal covariance of the boundary eld o(x) results from the general analysis of
section 3.

the interesting question whether the spectral condition b) might be derived from con-

dition b) together with ads invariance will be left for future work.
