abstract

we nd the terms in the nonabelian world-volume action of a system of many
dp-branes which describe the leading coupling to all type ii supergravity background
elds. these results are found by t-dualizing earlier results for d0-branes, which
in turn were determined from calculations of the m(atrix) theory description of the
supercurrent of 11d supergravity. our results are compatible with earlier results on
the supersymmetric born-infeld action for a single d-brane in a general background
and with tseytlins symmetrized trace proposal for extending the abelian born-infeld
action to a nonabelian theory.
in the case p = 3, the operators we nd on the d-
brane world-volume are closely related to those which couple to supergravity elds
in the ads5  s5 iib supergravity background. this gives an explicit construction,
including normalization, of some of the operators used in the celebrated ads/cft
correspondence for 3-branes. we also discuss the s-duality of the action in the case
p = 3, nding that the s-duality of the action determines how certain operators in the
n = 4 4d sym theory transform under s-duality. these s-duality results give some
new insight into the puzzle of the transverse 5-brane in m(atrix) theory.

1 introduction

since polchinskis realization in 1995 [1] that the dirichlet p-branes of string theory carry
ramond-ramond (r-r) charge and should be identied with r-r charged black brane so-
lutions of supergravity, d-branes have become one of the most important tools in analyzing
string theory and m-theory. d-branes have been used to construct and study black holes
and supersymmetric eld theories with many interesting properties. it is even believed that
d-branes can be used to describe all of string theory and m-theory in certain regimes and
in certain backgrounds, through the m(atrix) theory [2] and ads/cft proposals [3]. (for
reviews and further references see [4, 5] for general background on d-branes, [6] for black
holes from d-branes, [7] for eld theories from d-branes, [8, 9, 10, 5] for m(atrix) theory and
[11] for the ads/cft correspondence.)

to understand the behavior of d-branes in dierent contexts, it is of fundamental im-
portance to have a description of their dynamics in a general string theory background. to
date, our understanding of this description is somewhat incomplete. for a single d-brane it
is known that the classical dynamics in a general string background should have a bosonic
part described by the born-infeld action [12] combined with wess-zumino terms describing
the coupling to r-r background elds [13] and to the curvature of the background metric
[14, 15, 16]. the fermionic part of the theory can be included into a -symmetric action
both in at space [17, 18] and in a general type ii supergravity background [19, 20, 21]. for
a single dirichlet p-brane this story is essentially complete: the degrees of freedom in the
world-volume theory are the 9p transverse scalar elds x i, a world-volume u(1) gauge eld
a and fermionic elds which complete a supersymmetry multiplet with 16 supercharges. in
the low-energy limit the supersymmetric born-infeld action for a dp-brane reduces to the
maximally supersymmetric u(1) yang-mills action in p + 1 dimensions.

for a system of multiple dp-branes, the world-volume action is much less well understood
than for a single brane. in the low-energy limit, the action for a system of n parallel dp-
branes in a at supergravity background reduces to the maximally supersymmetric u(n)
yang-mills theory in p + 1 dimensions [22]. the extension of this action to a full super-
symmetric or -symmetric nonabelian born-infeld action is not known. it was suggested by
tseytlin [23] that at least for the bosonic terms, such an extension can be found by using a
symmetrized trace to resolve ordering ambiguities inherent in the higher order terms of the
born-infeld action. although this proposal has not yet been derived from any more funda-
mental principles, the symmetrized trace gives results compatible with other approaches such
as direct string computation [24, 25] and m(atrix) theory calculations [26, 27], at least at
low order in the eld strength f (see, however, [28, 29] for a related puzzle). a recent review
of the state of knowledge regarding both the abelian and nonabelian born-infeld action is
given in [30].

in this paper we nd a new set of terms in the action describing a system of multiple
dp-branes in a general type ii supergravity background. the new terms which we identify
are terms in the action which couple the world-volume elds linearly to the background

1

supergravity elds and all their higher derivatives. for a given derivative of a background
eld, we determine the lowest dimension operator in the world-volume theory which couples
to the background eld derivative at linear order.
in a previous paper [31] we described
this set of couplings for a system of multiple d0-branes. these results were achieved by
transforming earlier results for matrix theory in a weak background [32] using the limiting
procedure suggested by seiberg and sen [33, 34] for relating the matrix description of m-
theory to the n d0-brane action in iia string theory. in this paper we t-dualize the results
of [31] to nd the leading linear part of the nonabelian born-infeld action for a dp-brane
of arbitrary dimension. in addition, we show how t-duality may also be used starting with
the known abelian d9-brane action to derive non-abelian terms in all lower dimensional dp-
brane actions, providing an alternate derivation of some of our results and giving a large set
of additional terms.

the paper is organized as follows. in section 2 we review our results for d0-branes and
perform the t-duality transformation to nd terms in the action for a d-brane of arbitrary
dimension. in section 3 we compare our results in the abelian case to the known -symmetric
action for a single dp-brane. we nd that the two methods are consistent, though there is
a subtlety in the comparison of fermion terms. we further show how the known abelian d9-
brane action may be used to derive a large set of additional terms in the non-abelian actions
for lower dimensional dp-branes using t-duality. in section 4 we discuss the s-duality of
our action in the case p = 3 and comment on a connection with the transverse 5-brane of
matrix theory. section 5 contains some comments on the connection of our results with the
ads/cft correspondence, including a discussion of how the actions we derive may be used
in the study of d-brane black holes. we conclude in section 6 with a brief discussion of the
expected corrections to the actions we have derived as well as possible further developments.
while we were completing this paper we received a preprint by myers [35] which contains
in particular, the treatment in [35] is closely related to our

some closely related results.

2 linear brane-background couplings

in this section we determine the lowest dimension operators on a dp-brane of arbitrary
dimension which couple linearly to the derivatives of the type ii background supergravity
elds. we assume that the background elds represent small variations around a at space
background.

2.1 review of d0-brane results

we begin by reviewing the method and results of our earlier paper [31] describing d0-branes
in weak background elds.

the main idea was to learn about d0-branes using matrix theory results by exploiting
the relationship between the action for d0-branes in type iia string theory and the matrix

2

theory action which describes the dlcq of m-theory. given the action for d0-branes in
a specied background, seiberg and sen have given a very explicit prescription [33, 34] for
how to derive the matrix model of m-theory in the related background. for the case of
at space, the matrix theory action arises as the lowest dimension part of the string theory
action describing the dynamics of d0-branes in at space. similarly, the action for matrix
theory in a general 11-dimensional supergravity background should arise from leading terms
in the action for d0-branes in a general type iia supergravity background.
in previous
work [32], we derived explicitly the action for matrix theory in the presence of arbitrary
weak 11-dimensional supergravity elds, so our strategy in [31] was to use these results and
reverse the seiberg-sen prescription to deduce the leading terms in the d0-brane action in
the presence of arbitrary type iia supergravity elds.

in the general background matrix theory action, the 11-dimensional supergravity back-
ground elds and their derivatives couple to matrix theory expressions for the multipole mo-
ments of the various conserved 11-dimensional supergravity currents. naturally, the back-
ground metric couples to the matrix theory expressions for moments of the stress-energy
tensor, denoted by t ij(k1kn) while the three-form aijk appears in the action coupled elec-
trically to the moments of the membrane current, j ijk(k1kn), and magnetically to moments
of the vebrane current m ijklm n (k1kn). the complete expressions for t , j, and m were
derived in [27, 32] by comparing a matrix theory calculation of the long-distance interaction
potential between two completely general systems with the analogous potential in super-
gravity. these expressions are reproduced for convenience in the appendix.

turning to the d0-brane action, the most general form for the terms linear in bosonic

background elds can be written as

slinear = sat +z dt

 ) i (k1 kn)

+ (k1    kn) i (k1kn)



(1)

here, all elds and their derivatives are evaluated at the origin of 9-dimensional space,
around which point we have taylor expanded the action. sat is the at space action for
n d0-branes, whose leading terms are the dimensional reduction of d=10 sym theory to
0+1 dimensions. the complete form of the higher order terms in the at space action is
not known, but the subleading terms vanish in the matrix theory limit. we assume that the
background satises the source-free iia supergravity equations of motion so that the dual
elds c, b, c (3) are well-dened 7-, 6- and 5-form elds given (at linear order) by

d c = dc,

(2)
the sources i2n are associated with (multipole moments of) dirichlet 2nbrane currents,
while the sources is and i5 are associated with fundamental string and ns5-brane currents
respectively.

starting from the general form (1), we applied the seiberg-sen prescription to arrive at an
expression for the general background matrix theory action in terms of the unknown currents
i. demanding equivalence with our previously derived explicit results for the matrix theory
action, we were led to a set of constraints on the currents i which could then be solved to
determine the leading (lowest dimension) term in each current (as well as some subleading
terms) in terms of the matrix theory expressions t , j, and m listed in the appendix. the
results for the lowest dimension operators appearing in the monopole (integrated) d0-brane
currents are (with ns-ns currents in the left column and r-r currents in the right column)

it is believed that the operators i  
representing ns5-brane current vanish identically;
this issue is discussed further in section 4. there are additional terms analogous to those in
(1) describing the coupling to the fermionic background elds of the iia theory; these can
be determined from the results of [32] by applying the seiberg-sen limiting procedure.

it may seem surprising that a system of d0-branes will couple to all the supergravity
elds b, c (3)
, . . . for which the usual sources are the fundamental string, the d2-brane,
etc. in fact, however, this result follows from t-duality from the well-known results that
fundamental strings, momentum and lower-dimensional d(p  2k)-branes can be described
in terms of the eld strength of the u(n) gauge eld in the world-volume of a dp-brane. for
example, the fact that in the system of d0-branes the operator j +ij  [x i, x j] carries d2-
brane charge is t-dual to the statement that f ij ux on a dp-brane describes a d(p2)-brane
extended in the directions perpendicular to the i, j directions [13, 5]. in matrix theory this
is familiar as the mechanism by which a regularized membrane is composed of n pointlike

4

partons [36, 2]. similarly, the statement that the operator m +ijkl  x [ix jx kx l] carries
d4-brane charge [37, 38] is t-dual to the statement that the instanton density f  f on a
dp-brane corresponds to d(p  4)-brane density [13]. the results of [31] can be interpreted
as giving explicit expressions for how the moments of the currents associated with all higher-
dimensional branes can be expressed in terms of the matrix degrees of freedom of a system
of d0-branes. the subset of these moments associated with conserved brane charges were
constructed using the supersymmetry algebra in [38].

we would like to emphasize that all the d0-brane operators determined explicitly by
the comparison to matrix theory are dened in terms of a symmetrized trace over the non-
abelian elds. however, it is not clear whether this prescription remains true for the higher
dimension operators that we are unable to determine.

2.2 t-duality of supergravity backgrounds

we would now like to t-dualize our results for the d0-brane case to nd terms in the non-
abelian born-infeld and wess-zumino actions for arbitrary d-branes which are linear in the
background elds. to do this, we must understand the action of t-duality both on the
supergravity background elds and the elds living on the d-brane. we discuss t-duality
on the background elds in this subsection and t-duality of the d-brane eld theory in the
following subsection.

the usual t-duality of string theory on a compact circle can be generalized to arbitrary
backgrounds which are independent of the compactication direction [39, 40]. we are only
interested at this point in the linear parts of the t-duality transformation. we begin, how-
ever by recalling the complete transformation rules for a set of background elds which are
independent of a set of n toroidally compactied coordinates x on which we perform the
t-duality transform. we will use the nonlinear form of the t-duality transformation rules
in section 3 when we discuss the nonabelian born-infeld action. throughout this section
we use barred indices , , . . . for the compact spatial directions in which a t-duality is
performed and indices , , . . . for the remaining 10 p space-time dimensions (including 0).
it turns out that the complete t-duality rules are greatly simplied if we combine the
background elds into the combinations in which they appear in the born-infeld and wess-
zumino actions. thus, we dene elds

g = g  b
c(n) = c (n)  c (n2)  b +

1
2!

c (n4)  b  b + . . .

we now suppose that the elds are independent of n coordinates x and apply the rules in
[40] in order to t-dualize in each of the directions. for the elds we have just dened, the

5

complete non-linear transformation rules are simply1

here, g   is the inverse of g  , so we see that under t-duality, the matrix g   which we
have assumed to be constant transforms into its inverse.
in this section we will only use the linearized forms of these t-duality relations. writing

2.3 t-duality of d-brane elds

we now turn to the action of t-duality for the elds living on the brane. the low-energy
action for a dp-brane living in at space is simply the dimensional reduction of d = 10 sym
theory to p + 1 dimensions. if we retain the d = 10 notation for all of the dp-brane theories
and simply reinterpret the expressions appropriately, (i.e. fai = dax i, fij = i[x i, x j])
then the expressions for the low-energy actions are identical in each case. in other words,
the action of t-duality on expressions written in terms of d = 10 quantities is merely an
appropriate reinterpretation of the notation. the only subtlety in this interpretation arises
when we consider the transverse elds x i associated with a compact direction.
in this
situation, these elds are formally described by innite matrices containing n  n blocks
indexed by an integer associated with string winding number. the components of these

1the transformation laws for the rr elds have additional terms in the case of massive type iia

supergravity.

6

matrices are t-dual to the momentum modes of the corresponding gauge eld component
ai on the t-dual brane. the details of this correspondence are worked out in [41].

the matrix theory expressions for the moments of the d = 11 supergravity currents may
all be rewritten naturally in d = 10 language. throughout the remainder of the paper we
use these expressions with the understanding that they should be interpreted in terms of the
appropriate (p + 1)-dimensional sym variables in the p-brane action.

2.4 t-duality results: the dp-brane action

rewriting the known terms in the d0-brane action using the d = 10 expressions for the
matrix theory supercurrent components and transforming using the linearized t-duality
rules (6), it is a fairly straightforward task to nd the terms of interest in all of the higher
dp-brane actions.

starting from the d0-brane action (1) and applying the rules above, we nd that the

dp-brane action may be written2,3

the currents in these expressions are written in terms of the 0-brane currents ix given
in (3) which in turn are given in terms of the t s, js and ms listed in the appendix, and
are to be interpreted as d = 10 expressions dimensionally reduced to p + 1 dimensions.
the higher moment terms will be of exactly the same form as the terms listed above, with
arbitrary derivatives of each background eld coupling to the appropriate higher moment of
the corresponding current. for example, the lowest dimension terms coupling to hij will be

2to write the action in the einstein frame, we make the substitution h  h + 1
3here, we use hatted indices for worldvolume spatial indices (i.e. excluding 0), while indices i, j, . . . denote

2  

transverse spatial indices.

7

as a consequence of our derivation from the d0-brane action, the index 0 appears to be
on a dierent footing than the remaining woldvolume indices a, b, . . . in the expressions (7)
and (8). for example, bab couples to
i ab

s = 3j +ab + 3j ab + . . .

while b0a couples to

i 0a

h = t +a  t a + . . .

on the other hand, we would expect the dp-brane action to exhibit p+1 dimensional lorentz
symmetry in the worldvolume directions, therefore, bab (including 0 indices) should couple
to a lorentz tensor i ab. if so, it must be the case that

3j +ab + 3j ab + . . . = i ab
t +a  t a + . . . = 2i 0a

for some tensor i ab. examining the expressions for t and j in the appendix, we see that
the d = 10 notation makes it clear that t +a + t a and j +ab  j ab are indeed (0a) and
(ab) components of a lorentz tensor. in a similar way, we nd that t ij is related to j +i,
and j ijk is related to m +ijkl. this was not obvious from the expressions for t , j, and m
as they appeared in previous papers. as a result of these relationships, it turns out that
both expressions (7) and (8) are in fact lorentz invariant. this provides a rst check of our
results, and xes several signs in the currents which were undetermined in [32].

another obvious test of the results we have derived is to compare with the case n = 1,
where our results should match with the known abelian dp-brane actions.
in particular,
we note that for the case p = 9, the world volume theory contains no scalar elds, and
all of the terms we have written are symmetrized traces of expressions involving only the
world-volume eld strength, the fermions, and covariant derivatives on the fermions. as a
result, if we specialize to the abelian u(1) case for p = 9, the action will look the same as
in the nonabelian theory, apart from covariant derivatives becoming usual derivatives and
the ordering in products of eld strengths f which must be taken into account in the
nonabelian theory. this similarity between the terms in the u(1) and u(n) actions for
the 9-brane is in contrast to all of the lower-dimensional brane actions which have terms
containing fij = i[x i, x j] and di = i[x i, ] which vanish in the abelian theory. however,
all of these terms t-dualize to terms in the p = 9 action which do not vanish in the abelian
case. therefore a comparison of our p = 9 results with the p = 9 abelian born-infeld and
wess-zumino actions will provide a check not only of the complete set of terms in our p = 9
action, but also of strictly non-abelian terms in p < 9 actions 4. we perform this check
in section 3.1, and in section 3.2, we will reverse this logic and use the full p = 9 abelian

4since we must assume that the background elds are independent of directions transverse to the brane
in order to t-dualize to p = 9, we will not be able to check terms coupling to transverse derivatives of the
background elds in this way

born-infeld and wess-zumino actions to deduce a large set of additional terms in the non-
abelian p-brane actions for p < 9. in preparation for these comparisons, and as an example
of the results from this section, we now write explicitly the terms we have derived for the
case p = 9.

2.5 example: d9-brane

in the case p = 9, there are no transverse indices i so the story simplies considerably. the
terms of lowest dimension in the nonabelian theory coupling linearly to the ns-ns and r-r
background elds are given by

note that in order to t-dualize in all 9 spatial directions we have assumed that the back-
ground elds are independent of all spatial coordinates, so there are no higher moment
contributions to this action. of course, we expect that spatial variations in the background
elds can be incorporated into this action by simply assuming that all world-volume elds
as well as background elds in the action have spatial dependence. we will discuss this issue
in some further detail in section 3.2.

5to derive the terms below by t-duality, we have assumed the background elds are constant, in which
case the fermion terms are all total derivatives. these fermion terms do not seem to appear in the -
symmetric actions, so it seems that we should integrate by parts before restoring spacetime dependence of
the background.

6the denition of c2m here reects a change from (8) to more standard normalization conventions for the

r-r elds.

3 comparison with the abelian theory

in this section, we compare our results to the known abelian d-brane theories. in section
(3.1), we show that the actions we have derived agree with a gauge xed version of the
abelian -symmetric d-brane actions. in section (3.2), we show that the abelian d9-brane
action may be t-dualized to determine non-abelian terms in the lower d-brane actions. this
provides an alternate derivation of some of our results plus a large set of additional higher
order terms for both the born-infeld and wess-zumino actions.

3.1 abelian -symmetric d-brane theory

we now compare our results to the known abelian -symmetric action for a dp-brane. for
a detailed discussion of these actions, see the original references [17, 18, 19, 20, 21].

the -symmetric dp-brane actions are most naturally understood in terms of the super-
space formalism for type iia/iib supergravity. in addition to the usual bosonic coordinates,
type iia/iib superspace contains fermionic coordinates which form a pair of majorana-weyl
spinors of opposite/the same chirality.

the complete action may be written as the sum of a born-infeld type action and a

wess-zumino action which take their usual form,

sdbi = z dp+1eqdet(gij + fij)
sw z = z ef xq

c (q)

(11)

except that now the background elds are replaced by elds and dierential forms on super-
space. here, we dene

fij = fij  bwv

ij

where fij is the usual eld strength of the world volume gauge eld but now bwv
is the
ij
pullback of the superspace two-form bm n to the worldvolume. in the wess-zumino term,
the sum runs over even rr-forms in the iib case and odd rr-forms in the iia case, which
are also dened as pull-backs of superspace forms. there are additional curvature terms
which must appear in (11) to cancel anomalies in the world-volume theory [14, 15, 16].
these terms are linear in the background r-r elds and at least quadratic in curvature so
they will not aect our discussion of the linearized couplings and we will ignore them here.

the superspace geometry is described in terms of a super-vielbein one form

ea = dz m ea
m

and connection one form7 a

b. in terms of these, the pullback of the metric is given by

gij = iz m ea

m jz n eb

n ab

7we use m, n, . . . superspace coordinate indices, and a, b, . . . for local frame indices. we will use lower
case latin indices a, b, m, n, . . . refer to bosonic coordinates and lower case greek indices to refer to fermionic
coordinates.

10

the fermionic components of the various forms are determined by constraints on their eld
strengths, which may be found in [20]. these constraints are simplest in the basis dened by
the one-forms ea, however it is important to write the components with all bosonic indices
in the coordinate basis rather than the frame basis so that the supergravity elds appearing
in the nal action are the usual ones. for example, we have in the type iib case,

bwv

while the constraints on the eld strength of b may be solved by

ba = i(a3), b = (a)((a3))

the matrix 3 is a 2  2 pauli matrix which acts on the index labeling the two fermionic
superspace coordinates.

the born-infeld and wess-zumino actions above are separately invariant under 32 global
supersymmetries which are guaranteed by their superspace covariant form. in addition, the
combination is invariant under a 16-dimensional local fermionic -symmetry.

to relate these -symmetric actions, which have two spacetime majorana-weyl spinors
and ten spacetime coordinates, to our action which is written in terms of a single worldsheet
majorana-weyl spinor and 9  p scalars, we must use -symmetry to set one linear combi-
nation of the fermionic coordinates to zero and use reparametrization invariance to identify
the rst p + 1 spacetime coordinates with the p + 1 worldsheet coordinates (the static gauge).
since the local -symmetry is 16-dimensional, it is completely used up in eliminating half of
the fermion elds.

the fermion terms in the resulting action will depend on which combination of the
fermions we choose to set to zero. to reproduce the results we have derived in the previous
section, we must therefore make a specic choice for the xing of -symmetry, however it
is not obvious what this choice should be. let us focus on the case p = 9. in this case, it
seems that any lorentz invariant choice would amount to setting

1 = a,

2 = b.

11

one natural choice, taking (a, b) = (0, 1) or (a, b) = (1, 0) was demonstrated for the at
space action in [18]. with this choice, all terms in the wess-zumino action independent of
the background elds vanish, leaving only the born-infeld action. it may be checked that
this choice gives an action whose fermion terms do not agree with our results. in particular,
it gives a dimension 4 fermion operator coupling to b, while in our results, b couples only
to operators of dimension 2 and 6. as it turns out, the abelian terms in the actions we have
derived seem consistent with another natural choice8, a = b = 1/2, that is, we set

1 = 2 =

1
2

.

this is the p = 9 version of killing gauge [42].

to implement this gauge choice, we simply replace

11, 1  1,

2, 3  0

in all fermion bilinears.

with our choice of gauge the expressions for gij and fij simplify to

(12)

we are now in a position to explicitly write down the gauge xed forms of the actions (11)
and compare with the abelian version of our results. for the bosonic terms, we nd complete
agreement between the two methods for all of the operators we have derived. comparing
the fermion terms, we nd something unexpected. the gauge xed -symmetric action
matches our results precisely if we assume that the p-form elds appearing in the matrix
theory derived expressions (9,10) are to be identied with world-volume elds rather than
spacetime elds. we do not understand why this should be the case, however we note
that since the d9-brane lls spacetime, the distinction between worldvolume indices and
spacetime indices is somewhat subtle here.

as an example of this, we compute the operator coupling to bmn in the gauge xed
action. from (11), we see that b appears in the action only in the combination f . thus,
the complete dependence on b may be easily obtained from the at space action by making
the substitution fij  fij. up to dimension 8, the background independent part of the
action, including contributions from both the born-infeld and wess-zumino terms is9

however, this has the eect of eliminating the term i
disagreement if we try to identify the b in (9) with the b having spacetime indices. the
same eect appears when comparing the operators coupling to the ramond-ramond elds.
it is possible that a dierent method of xing -symmetry and reparametrization sym-
metry would give a gauge xed action in which the spacetime b appeared as in expression
(9), however, it is dicult to see how a change in the gauge xing could aect only the single
term without changing the others that already agree. we leave it as a puzzle to understand
why agreement is obtained by comparison with the pulled-back world-volume p-forms rather
than spacetime p-form elds in the d9-brane action.

one could repeat this analysis for the cases p < 9 by gauge xing the other abelian
-symmetric dp-brane actions and comparing with our results, however, as discussed above,
the comparison for p = 9 already provides a check for all terms in the lower dp-brane
actions which do not contain derivatives of the background elds in directions transverse to
the brane.
in fact, since many terms for p < 9 vanish in the abelian case but t-dualize
to p = 9 terms which do not vanish, a comparison with the lower dimensional -symmetric
actions would actually be a less stringent check than the one we have already performed.
rather, we will now exploit the connection between terms in the abelian 9-brane action and
non-abelian terms in the lower brane actions to deduce a large set of additional terms for
these actions.

the omitted terms give no contribution with our choice of gauge, while the remaining components only con-
tribute terms of dimension greater than 8. only the components of c(4k+2) give a non-vanishing contribution
in our gauge.

10here, we ignore terms which vanish by the equations of motion

3.2 non-abelian terms from the abelian p = 9 action

in this subsection we compare our results derived from matrix theory and the d0-brane
action by t-dualizing in p directions to the action found by t-dualizing the born-infeld
action of a d9-brane in 9  p directions. a related discussion is given in the recent paper of
myers [35].

3.2.1 bosonic born-infeld terms

let us rst consider the bosonic terms in the born-infeld action for the case p = 9.
if,
following the proposal of tseytlin for the at space case, we simply dene the non-abelian
born-infeld action for d9-branes to be that set of terms not containing any commutators of
f s 11 then the remaining action will be (by denition) a symmetrized trace over products
of f s with indices contracted in various ways. as argued above, the restriction to the
abelian case will clearly give exactly the same set of terms, the only dierence being that the
symmetrized trace may be dropped, since all the f s commute already. thus, we conclude
that the complete set of terms in the non-abelian action not containing commutators of f s
should be obtained from the abelian case by imposing a symmetrized trace, that is

s = z d10xstr (cid:18)eqdet(gab  bab + fab)(cid:19)

(13)

this is a simple generalization of the proposal by tseytlin for the at space case. starting
from this action, we may now apply the t-duality rules above to nd a large set of terms in
the lower dp-brane actions. the resulting actions include terms with explicit commutators
[x i, x j] and are therefore are a much less obvious generalization of the corresponding abelian
actions than (13).

in our case, dualizing to determine the other dp-brane actions is more complicated than
for at space, due to the presence of background supergravity elds, however, the simple
form of t-duality rules derived above will allow us to proceed without much diculty.

we choose n directions labeled by xi over which the t-duality is to be performed and
assume for now that the background elds are independent of these directions. using our
results for the d0-brane action, we will later be able to reinstate dependence on these direc-
tions (which will be transverse to the brane). to perform the t-duality, we rst rewrite the
d9-brane action in terms of the eld g = gb dened above, distinguishing between indices
i, j, . . . in the directions to be dualized and indices a, b, . . . in the non-dualized directions that
will become transverse and world-volume indices respectively. we have

s = z d10xstr (cid:18)eqdet(gab + fab)(cid:19)
= z d10xstr 

evuutdet  gab + fab gaj + faj
gib + fib gij + fij !


11this is analogous to the abelian restriction to terms not containing derivatives of f s since we may rewrite

[fab, fcd] = d[adb]fcd.

14

= z d10xstr (cid:18)eqdet(gij + fij)det(gab + fab  (gai + fai)(gij + fij)1(gjb + fjb))(cid:19)

where in the last line, we have used the identity

det  a b

c d ! = det(  11

0

0 d !  a
= det(d)det(a  bd1c)

we now dimensionally reduce the world volume elds to p + 1 dimensions and replace the
background elds by their duals. the resulting expression is

sdp

bi = tpz dp+1str ne (det[ij + gikfkj])

(14)

det[gab + fab  gaigijgjb + (gai + fakgki)(g + gfg)ij(gjb + gjlfbl)](cid:17)1/2(cid:27)
here, gij is the inverse of gij = gij  bij and the term (g + gfg)ij is the inverse of
(gij +gikfklglj). we also recall that fai = dax i, fij = i[x i, x j], and fab is the usual world
volume eld strength.

in the absence of background elds,

action becomes

it may be checked that this action reduces to
in the abelian case with background elds, the

sdp

u (1) = tpz dp+1eqdet(gab + gaifbi + gibfai + gijfaifbj + fab)

= tpz dp+1eqdet(gab + gaibx i + gibax i + gijax ibx j + fab)

which is equivalent to the usual covariant action

sdp = tpz dp+1eqdet(gax bx  + fab)

in the static gauge where we identify x a = a.

by expanding (14) and keeping only terms linear in the background supergravity elds,

one may verify that the leading terms are exactly the bosonic terms derived in section 2.

it is interesting to compare how the matrix theory and dbi approaches describe coupling
to background elds with spatial dependence. first consider those directions perpendicular
to the p-brane. from the matrix theory approach, we may have dependence of the back-
ground supergravity elds on these transverse directions, which are described by the higher
moment terms in (7). we do not know how to explicitly t-dualize background elds de-
pending on the compact coordinate, so we cannot determine these terms in the p-brane dbi
action by t-dualizing from the 9-brane. for the bosonic terms, however, it is easy to see
that we may reproduce the dependence found from the matrix theory approach in the action
simply by taking the background elds to be functions of the world-volume coordinates and

15

the transverse scalar elds and then formally expanding in the transverse scalars inside the
symmetrized trace. for example

 = (o, . . . , p, x p+1, . . . , x 9)

(15)

=



xn=0

1
n!{k1    kn}(o, . . . , p, 0, . . . , 0)x k1    x kn

it seems natural to assume that this prescription also applies to the full non-linear action
(14), so we interpret all background elds in this expressions to be expansions of the form
(15). such a prescription has also been veried in certain cases by explicit string theory
scattering calculations [43].

in contrast to the situation for the transverse coordinates, the born-infeld approach gives
an action in which the background elds have a natural dependence on the world-volume
coordinates a, but such a dependence cannot be included when t-dualizing from the 0-brane
action. it is quite straightforward to extend the results of section 2 by making all d-brane
elds and background elds explicitly dependent on the world-volume coordinates.

it would be interesting to invert this chain of argument and ask what we can learn from
this discussion about the action of t-duality in the presence of a background eld which
depends on the compact coordinate.
in the language of the world-volume theory of the
dp-brane wrapped around a torus t p, dependence of the background elds on the compact
degrees of freedom is naturally incorporated in the spatial dependence of the background
elds and the world-volume elds. formally inverting the t-duality transformation [41] to
get a theory of (formally innite) d0-brane matrix degrees of freedom, we nd a nontrivial
coupling between block components of the d0-brane matrices and the fourier modes of
the original background elds. whether such a background can be interpreted as simply
a nontrivial classical supergravity background for the d0-brane system is not clear; this
may be a more general class of backgrounds with no classical description, if indeed these
backgrounds are consistent. we leave a further investigation of this question to further work.

3.2.2 bosonic wess-zumino terms

we now adopt a similar method to derive terms in the non-abelian dp-brane wess-zumino
actions.

we again start from the abelian 9-brane action, which in terms of the eld c  ceb

dened above may be written

a1 a2mfa2m+1a2m+2    fa9a10

here, the f s are already symmetrized, so there is no ordering ambiguity in passing to the
non-abelian version. using the t-duality rules for the background elds (5), we then nd

16

that the dp-brane wz action is

(16)

where

cp
q,n 

(1)n(n1)/2(p + 2n  q)!!
n! (q  n)! (n + p  q + 1)!

.

in (16), the indices in brackets are to be assigned pairwise to the product of f s and then
symmetrized over all possible orderings. as for the born-infeld action, the background elds
should be taken as functions of the world volume coordinates with scalar matrices inserted in
place of the transverse coordinates, in order to reproduce the bosonic higher moment terms
derived from matrix theory. again, we may compare terms linear in the background elds
from this action to the terms we have derived from the d0-brane results, and we nd that
both methods give a consistent answer 12.

for p < 9, this action contains many terms involving fij which do not appear in the
abelian case. specically, while the abelian action has couplings involving only r-r q-forms
with q < p + 1 the non-abelian action contains terms involving all allowed r-r elds (i.e.
q odd/even for p even/odd). physically, just as a given p-brane can carry p  2n brane
charge measured locally by (f[a1a2    fa2n1a2n]), a collection of p-branes can carry (moments
of) p + 2n brane charge measured by tr (f[i1i2    fi2n1i2n]) (with insertions of xs). as
mentioned in section 2.1, this is perhaps most familiar from the matrix theory point of
view, where membrane (d2-brane) states and longitudinal 5-brane (d4-brane) states may
be constructed out of zerobranes.

3.2.3 fermion terms from p = 9

as for the bosonic terms, one could use the p = 9 abelian action to deduce the symmetrized
trace terms with background elds independent of the transverse directions for the fermionic
terms in all the non-abelian p-brane actions by imposing a symmetrized trace on the p = 9
action and dimensionally reducing. however, while for the bosonic terms we were able to
restore dependence of the background elds on the transverse directions simply by making
them functions of the matrices x i, such a prescription does not give all of the fermion terms
coupled to transverse derivatives of the background elds, as may be seen in specic cases.
some of these terms would appear in the abelian p-brane actions and should be derivable
by considering the -symmetric p-brane action, but there is no clear way to nd terms with
commutators apart from our methods in the section 2. thus, it is not possible to reproduce
all of our results simply by considering the abelian actions.

12the normalization conventions in the r-r elds in (8) are slightly dierent from the usual ones used

here but the relation between the two conventions may be easily read o by comparing (8) and (16)

17

4 d3-branes and s-duality

the sl(2,z) s-duality symmetry of type iib string theory maps a d3-brane into another
d3-brane [44]. we would like to see how this s-duality invariance is manifested in the
multiple dp-brane action we have derived in the case p = 3. for the case of a single d3-
brane, the combination of born-infeld and wess-zumino actions have been shown explicitly
to lead to equations of motion which possess an s-duality invariance involving simultaneous
transformations of the background elds and the world-volume elds on the d3-brane [45,
46, 47, 48]. since we do not have the full non-abelian d3-brane actions it will not be
possible to demonstrate the complete s-duality of the theory with many d3-branes in a
type iib supergravity background. however, using the linear couplings we have derived
and the known transformation properties of the supergravity elds, we will show that the
requirement of s-duality gives information about the transformation properties of various
operators on the world-volume. we nd a new prediction for the s-dual of certain operators
constructed from the transverse scalar elds in the sym theory, and we show that this
duality transformation helps resolve an outstanding puzzle regarding the transverse 5-brane
of matrix theory.

4.1 s-duality and the linearized action

we focus on the z2 subgroup of the s-duality group generated by the transformation  which
exchanges the ns-ns and r-r two form elds. under this transformation, background elds
of iib string theory transform at linear order as13

  





c (0)  c (0)
b  c (2)
c  b(2)

in order to check that our action satises s-duality we write explicitly some of the terms
in the d3-brane action, beginning with the coupling of the world-volume bosonic elds to
the ns-ns and r-r scalar elds. the action in the absence of background elds is

13note that these transformation rules are written in einstein frame. although we have for the rest of
this paper been working in string frame, the terms in the action which we consider in this section are the
same in both frames so it is consistent to use the einstein frame transformation rules in combination with
the terms in the action produced by specializing (7,8) to the case p = 3.

we have no systematic knowledge of the s-duality transformation properties of the world-

ever, to generalize the relations from the abelian theory to analogous relations in the non-
abelian theory by simply performing a symmetrized trace on both sides of the relations (22,
23). this gives

(24)

note that in the nonabelian theory the duality transformation of the higher order terms in
f are not automatic consequences of the duality transformation of the linear term.

although the full abelian born-infeld action is not invariant under s-duality, the equa-
tions of motion of this theory are invariant [45, 46, 47]. we also expect that the terms
describing the leading operators coupling linearly to the background elds should transform
among themselves under s-duality. the simplest argument for this is that we would expect a
system of d-branes which couple to a given background supergravity eld such as b through
an operator ob to couple to the s-dual supergravity eld b (in this case c (2)) through the
s-dual operator ob = o b. in the ads/cft context a similar argument was given in [49].
from the proposed nonabelian s-duality relations (24), it is straightforward to check that
the leading terms in the action (18,19) which are linear in the background dilaton and axion
elds transform into themselves under s-duality. note that we have so far avoided discussing
the terms depending on the world-volume scalars x i. the duality transformation properties
of the operators containing these elds are not known, although we will now proceed to show
that something can be learned about how these operators transform from other terms in our
action.

when we consider the operators coupling to the 2-form elds bij and c (2)

we now turn to an analysis of the s-duality properties of the terms coupling to the
background ns-ns and r-r 2-form elds. the lowest dimension operators coupling to bab
and c (2)
ab are indeed related by nonabelian s-duality according to the prescription above.
while the terms coupling to bai and c (2)
ai do not seem to be exactly s-dual, the leading
operators at least have the same dimension; we will return to these operators momentarily.
ij with purely
transverse polarization indices, the s-duality of our action seems at rst glance to break
down completely. there is a dimension 2 operator coupling to the ns-ns 2-form eld, while
the rst operator coupling to the r-r eld has dimension 6. in order to resolve this apparent
contradiction, we need to recall that each of these elds is related to a dual 6-form eld to
which the ns-ns and r-r 5-branes are electrically coupled. in particular, consider the r-r
2-form eld. this eld is related to the r-r 6-form eld through

let us compare this to the terms coupling to the transversely polarized ns-ns 2-form eld.
since tr [a, b] vanishes for any u(n) matrices a, b, the rst nonvanishing term appears in
the rst moment and is given by

(28)

then the term (27) is precisely the s-dual of the leading operator in (26). thus, we see that
the condition that our action is s-duality invariant can be satised and indeed may give
new information about how operators formed from the transverse elds transform under
s-duality.

the mechanism we have just discovered can be seen to solve other apparent problems
with the s-duality of the couplings (20) and (21). as noted above, the dimension 4 oper-
ators coupling to the elds bai and c (2)
ai are not completely equivalent under s-duality. in
particular, the operator coupling to the ns-ns eld contains terms of the form faifij while
the operator coupling to the r-r eld contains no such terms. however, taking into account
contributions from the 6-form using (25) we see that the complete coupling of derivative of
this background eld is14

which has the correct s-duality relation with the term coupling to jbai as long as (28)
continues to hold with an insertion of fai.

we have thus seen that the s-duality invariance of our linearly coupled action can be ex-
plained by s-duality relations on the operators appearing in the maximally symmetric super
yang-mills theory such as (28).
it is interesting to compare this result with the conjec-
ture of intriligator [49] regarding the s-duality transformation properties of short operators
in the sym theory in the context of the ads/cft correspondence. the operators in the
sym theory are characterized by their transformation properties under the superconformal
symmetry group p su(2, 2|4). the operators which linearly couple to the background su-
pergravity elds live in short representations of the superconformal algebra, both in the
ads/cft correspondence and also in the action we are discussing here. (we will discuss
the ads/cft correspondence and its connection to our action in more detail in the next
section.) the operators in short representations of p su(2, 2|4) were classied in [50], and
an explicit table listing which operators in the sym theory correspond to which represen-
tations is given in [49].
in general, the short operators are uniquely determined by their
so(4) and su(4) transformation properties, and must therefore transform into themselves
under s-duality up to a sign.
in [49], a conjecture was made for the modular weights of
each of the short operators in the theory. the operators considered in (28) can be combined
into self-dual and anti-self-dual combinations under the 6-dimensional duality transforma-
tion arising from contraction with ijklmn. each of these combinations lives in an irreducible
representation of so(6)  su(4). our prediction that

s : tr ([x i, x j]x k)

ijklmntr ([x l, x m]x n)

(30)

14we do not need to worry about the constant pieces since constant bai and cai can be gauged away.

21

corresponds to the statement that the self-dual and anti-self-dual combinations of these
operators under the 6-dimensional epsilon symbol also transform into themselves under s-
duality so that one combination is self-s-dual and the other is anti-self-s-dual.

4.2 s-duality and transverse 5-branes in matrix theory

we conclude this section with a brief description of how this discussion of s-duality relates
to the problem of the transverse 5-brane in matrix theory15. consider a conguration of the
d3-brane theory on a 3-torus with transverse elds x 4, x 5 and x 6 given by

x 3+i = rj i

(31)

where j i are the generators of the n-dimensional representation of su(2). this conguration
contains a d5-brane with the geometry t 3  s2 where s2 is a sphere of radius r in the space
spanned by x 4x 6. under t-duality on the t 3 this becomes the standard membrane sphere
of matrix theory [51]. if the d5-brane conguration is acted on by s-duality, the resulting
conguration contains a ns5-brane of geometry t 3 s2. the t-dual of this is an ns5-brane
constructed from d0-branes, which should carry the rst moment of the ns5-brane charge
i 012345(6)
, and which should couple (magnetically) to the rst derivative of the ns-ns 2-form
5
eld of the iia theory. but we do not know any expression for the ns5-brane charge of
a system of 0-branes. such an expression would correspond to a charge for the transverse
5-brane of matrix theory, which is believed to vanish identically.

5

this apparent puzzle can be resolved by observing that even if the moment i 012345(6)
of the ns5-brane charge vanishes, the ns5-brane conguration we have just described cou-
ples correctly to the 2-form eld of the iia theory. the initial conguration carried a
nonzero charge tr (x [4x 5x 6]). the s-dual iib ns5-brane conguration thus carries a
charge tr (x [7x 8x 9]). the same charge is carried by the t-dual iia conguration which
should describe n 0-branes as well as an ns5-brane with geometry t 3  s2.
in the iia
background-dependent d0-brane action (1) this charge couples to the eld [7b89]. but this
eld is dual to the component [6 b012345] which we expect to describe the appropriate dipole
moment of the ns5-brane conguration. thus, we see that although there is no operator
describing transverse ns5-branes in matrix theory, and no corresponding ns5-brane oper-
ator i 0ijklm
in the iia theory, it is still possible to construct 0-brane congurations which
describe nite volume ns5-branes with higher multipole moments, which couple correctly
to the background gravitational elds. in matrix theory, such compact transverse m5-brane
congurations will couple correctly to the supergravity 3-form eld even though the operator
m +ijklm(n) is identically zero.

5 relation to the ads/cft correspondence

in this section we discuss applications of our results to the study of d-brane black holes and
a relation to the ads/cf t correspondence.

5.1 absorption by black holes

the most obvious application of the actions we have derived is to the study of d-branes
interacting with weak bulk supergravity elds. for example, the probability for absorption
of a particle  by a stack of coincident branes is exactly determined by the operators coupling
linearly to  in the nonabelian dp-brane action. if  couples to an operator o, then the
absorption cross-section for  may be read o from the two point function (see eg.[52])

ho(x)o(0)i

at low energies, only the lowest dimension part of the operator will contribute, and these
lowest dimension parts have been completely determined by our results for all supergravity
elds. a specic example which has already appeared [53], is the study of dilaton absorp-
tion by d3-branes. in that paper, we used our results to determine the lowest dimension
operators coupling to all derivatives of the dilaton eld in the nonabelian d3-brane action.
using these operators, we were able to compute the low-energy absorption cross-section for
all partial waves of the dilaton. we found that the results precisely agreed with the classical
supergravity calculation for dilaton partial wave absorption in the d3-brane geometry, giv-
ing evidence for the equivalence between the d3-brane world-volume theory and physics of
supergravity near the branes.

the exact numerical agreement found provided a stringent check of our results here,
including normalizations. in particular, we note that the symmetrized trace ordering pre-
scription was crucial for agreement. an important point to note about the comparison is
that the supergravity calculation is reliable only in a limit corresponding to strong thooft
coupling in the world-volume theory, which ensures weak curvatures in supergravity. the
agreement with our gauge theory calculation, carried out at weak coupling, implies that the
calculated two point functions are not renormalized. using the operators we have derived,
it should be possible to perform an explicit gauge theory calculation showing that the rst
g2n correction vanishes. this would be an excellent test of our results, since the purely
nonabelian terms in our operators, involving commutators of nonabelian elds, contribute
to the two point function only at this subleading order.

5.2 particle-operator correspondence

particle absorption calculations of the type just discussed provided early motivation for the
ads/cft conjecture [3], which in the most well-known example states that the physics of
supergravity in the near-horizon geometry of d3-branes (ads5  s5) is exactly described by

23

the low energy physics of the d3-brane world-volume elds, namely n = 4, d = 4 super-
yang-mills theory. in this subsection, we describe how the actions we have derived may be
used to obtain useful information about the ads/cft correspondence, and also how the
ads/cft correspondence may be used to obtain useful information about matrix theory.

consider again the process of particle absorption by d3-branes. at very low energies, the
near horizon region and the asymptotically at part of the d3-brane geometry almost decou-
ple. in this limit, particle absorption may be understood as a particle p0 in the asymptotic
region producing a very weak excitation in the transition region between minkowski space
and ads5  s5 which in turn excites one of the particles p of ads5  s5 (see for example
[54]). in the d-brane world-volume picture, the particle p0 turns on an operator op in the
gauge theory which governs the decay of p0 into particles on the world-volume. the exact
correspondence between particles on ads5  s5 and operators in the n = 4 super-yang-
mills world-volume theory is precisely the correspondence between the particles p and the
operators op which are excited by a given asymptotic particle p0.

this logic suggests a precise way of using our actions to determine the operator op
corresponding to a given supergravity particle p in ads5  s5, including normalization. we
consider the full supergravity solution corresponding to a stack of a large number of d3-
branes in the limit where the near horizon geometry is almost decoupled. as for ads5  s5,
this space will have a set of independently propagating excitations (normal modes). very
near the brane, the equations of motion reduce to those for ads5s5, so one of the particles
(normal modes) p  of the full supergravity solution must correspond to our particle p . in
the asymptotically at region, p  will look like some freely propagating particle p0. this is
precisely the particle, discussed above, that when sent in from innity will excite the particle
p in ads. thus, to determine the gauge theory operator corresponding to p , we simply read
o the leading operator coupling to p0 in the nonabelian d3-brane action expanded about
at space.

though this prescription is well dened in principle, it is usually a nontrivial task to
determine the particle p0 in the asymptotic region which corresponds to the ads particle p .
it requires diagonalizing the supergravity equations of motion in the two regions (and some-
times in an intermediate region) and matching the solutions on the overlaps. in particular,
the combination of supergravity elds describing p0 may in general be dierent than that
describing the particle p in the ads region.

in [55], das and trivedi gave a slightly dierent prescription, also using the d3-brane
action, for determining the relevant operators. rather than choosing the operator coupling
to p0 in the expansion of the at space d3-brane action, they suggested taking the operator
coupling to the particle p in the d3-brane action expanded about ads space. it may be that
both prescriptions give the same result. certainly in the case of a minimally coupled scalar,
the supergravity elds dening p and p0 are the same, so the two methods will give the
same operator at least up to normalization. for elds with more complicated propagators,
further work is needed to make the correspondence between operators on the d-brane and

24

asymptotic elds in the extremal geometry precise.

5.3 ads/cft and matrix theory

our results also suggest a precise link between matrix theory and the ads/cft conjecture
(for previous discussions of connections between these conjectures, see [56, 57, 58, 59, 60]).
in short, the d = 10 super-yang-mills theory operators whose dimensional reduction to
d = 3 + 1 correspond to particles in ads5  s5 are linear combinations of the operators
whose dimensional reductions to d = 0+1 describe the 11-dimensional supergravity currents
corresponding to a given matrix theory conguration. on the ads side, we have a series
of operators corresponding to an innite tower of kaluza-klein modes for each particle,
wheras in matrix theory, the series of operators corresponds to the innite set of multipole
moments of a given current16. an explicit example of this was given in [53], where the yang-
mills operator corresponding to the l-th kaluza-klein mode of the dilaton was found to be
a combination of the lth multipole moment of various components of the matrix theory
stress-energy tensor17,

t +(k1kl).

(32)

one particularly interesting aspect of this equivalence is that whereas the matrix theory
expressions for the supergravity currents were determined by a general a one-loop gauge
theory calculation, the operators corresponding to particles in ads may be determined
(except for normalization) simply by acting with tree level supersymmetry generators on the
chiral primary operators

str (x i1    x il)  {traces}

(33)

by the correspondence, it should therefore be possible to obtain the results of one-loop matrix
theory calculations simply by computing the action of tree level supersymmetry generators
on chiral primary elds. this observation was put into practice in [53] where the four
fermion terms in the operators corresponding to all partial waves of the dilaton eld (and
therefore in the matrix theory currents on the right side of (32)) were computed by acting
with four supercharges on the chiral primary operators (33). the matrix theory operator
corresponding to the integrated component t  of the stress energy tensor is essentially the
complete one-loop matrix theory eective action, which has the form

str (f 4 

1
4

(f 2)2 + fermions).

on the ads side, we recognize this as the highest dimension operator o8 corresponding
to the weyl mode of the metric. so a complete calculation of the one-loop super-yang-
mills theory eective action appears to be equivalent to simply applying eight supercharges

16these matrix theory operators have also been related to the ads/cft correspondence by relating them

to a tower of kaluza-klein states in the near-horizon geometry of n d0-branes [61].

17here, the indices i, k are transverse to the brane, while the index a runs over the spatial brane directions.

25

to the chiral primary operator str (x ix jx kx l). we expect that the agreement between
these two approaches to calculating the dimension 8 operator is a result of the high degree
of supersymmetry in the systemindeed, another way to determine the structure of this
operator would be to generalize the methods of [62] to show that in the su(n) theory this
operator is uniquely determined by supersymmetry.

finally, we note that since all n = 4 sym operators corresponding to particles in ads5
s5 are constrained by supersymmetry to be symmetrized (the short representations to which
these operators belong are obtained by acting with supercharges on the symmetrized chiral
primary operator), an equivalence between these operators and the matrix theory current
operators would provide an explanation for the symmetrized trace both in the matrix theory
operators and in leading terms in the d-brane actions which we have derived. in this case,
the terms in the dp-brane actions which vanish in the matrix theory or ads/cft limits18
may not be subject to the same constraints from supersymmetry and therefore might be
expected to contain non-symmetrized terms. we discuss this point further below.

6 discussion

in this paper, we have derived the leading operators in all dp-brane actions coupling linearly
to each supergravity eld, (7,8). our results have been obtained by applying the rules of
t-duality to previous results for the d0-brane action. using the same t-duality rules we
have shown that the abelian d9-brane action may be used to deduce a large set of additional
terms in the symmetrized part of the nonabelian actions for all lower dp-branes. these
expressions, which include terms with arbitrary numbers of background and world-volume
elds appear as equations (14) and (16) respectively. these expressions do not represent the
complete dp-brane actions, and we now summarize the types of corrections that we expect
to occur.

6.1 higher order corrections

all of the leading operators that we have derived from matrix theory results are written in
terms of a symmetrized trace over the nonabelian elds. we have argued above that this
symmetrized trace prescription may be viewed as a constraint of supersymmetry on the terms
in the d-brane actions which survive in the matrix theory or ads/cft limits. for higher
order terms that vanish in these limits, the constraints no longer apply, so we do not have any
reason to believe that the symmetrized trace prescription continues to hold. in particular,
the higher order expressions (14) and (16) derived from the d9-brane action have been
written in terms of a symmetrized trace simply because we have ignored possible terms with
commutators of f s. indeed, it has been argued that such terms are necessary at order f 6 in
the at space nonabelian born-infeld action [29]. these commutator terms may be viewed as

18note that it appears to be the same set of terms which are preserved in both limits

26

higher derivative terms which vanish in the abelian theory, since [fab, fcd] = d[adb]fcd. the
dp-brane actions also contain explicit higher derivative terms which do not vanish for the
abelian case. these are excluded in the denition of the born-infeld action; for a discussion
see [30] and references therein.

a further type of correction to the actions we have derived involves terms of higher
order in the background elds. the expressions (14) and (16) derived from the d9-brane
actions contain terms at all orders in the background elds, however it may be shown that
these expressions are not complete since they do not satisfy the geodesic length criterion
proposed by douglas [63]. this criterion is relevant when we consider two parallel separated
branes, described in the world-volume theory by giving an expectation value to the diagonal
scalar elds which correspond to the positions of the two branes. for non-zero separation,
the o-diagonal scalar elds which arise from strings stretching between the branes should
acquire a mass equal to the geodesic distance between the branes. at linear order in the
background metric, it was shown in [31] that this geodesic distance criterion is exactly
satised for the d0-brane action we have found. however, for agreement at second order in
the metric, it is possible to show explicitly that additional terms involving (h)2 are required
beyond those appearing in the action (14). some of these terms have been worked out in
the case of d-branes on kahler manifolds in [64, 65], but for the most part these terms are
unknown. another set of terms which appear at higher order in the background elds arise
from the anomalous couplings discussed in [14, 15, 16]. these terms presumably all have
nonabelian counterparts which remain to be investigated.

finally, we note that there may be terms in the dp-brane action involving more than
a single trace over world-volume elds. these would seem necessary in order to reproduce
string theory amplitudes whose wordsheet involved more than a single boundary, for example
an annulus diagram with various world-volume elds inserted on each boundary. it is possible
that some of these terms could be derived using our methods by performing a matrix theory
calculation at higher than one loop.

we have listed all possible additional terms which may appear in a nonabelian born-
infeld type action in a general background, based on our understanding of the elds and
symmetries of the theory as well as the idea that such an action is dened as a sum over
string backgrounds.
it is not completely clear that there is really a unique well-dened
supersymmetric nonabelian born-infeld action which will satisfy all the criteria which the
abelian born-infeld action satises and which additionally satises douglas geodesic length
condition and the condition discussed in [28] that the string spectrum describing small uc-
tuations around a xed d-brane background should be reproduced by the nbi action. the
terms we have found here are good evidence that it is possible to extend the nonabelian
super-yang-mills theory describing multiple dp-branes to include higher order terms. one
might argue, however, that these linear couplings between background elds and the multiple
dp-brane world-volume theory are protected by supersymmetry and are therefore uniquely
determined while the denition of the higher order terms in the nonabelian born-infeld ac-

27

tion might be more ambiguous due to the lack of supersymmetric protection. it will be very
interesting to see whether further work will reveal a well-dened nbi action at all orders.

6.2 further directions

the most obvious direction in which this work could be pursued further is to try to use higher-
order matrix theory calculations to extend the born-infeld action to include terms coupling
to higher powers of the background elds. the next concrete step would be to generalize
the 3-graviton calculation of okawa and yoneya [66] to a general 3-body calculation, which
would be a general 2-loop calculation in an su(n) gauge theory with a block-diagonal
background containing 3 blocks of arbitrary size. as argued in [32], this general result would
indicate the structure of the quadratic coupling of a matrix theory object to background
elds, and by using the seiberg-sen limit this result should translate into a well-dened
result for the quadratic couplings of a system of n d0-branes to the background elds. by
using t-duality as in this paper, this would lead to the quadratic couplings of a system of
dp-branes of arbitrary dimension to the background elds. the correspondence between the
matrix theory calculation just described and supergravity interactions at the rst nonlinear
order depends upon the nonrenormalization of the general 2-loop su(n) calculation. the
agreement of the 2-loop calculation in the case of su(3) with supergravity gives hope that
such a nonrenormalization theorem may hold for general n. note, however, that the methods
of [62] do not apply to the 2-loop su(n) calculation when n > 3 so the terms we need may
not be renormalized [67]. if this is the case this approach may not help in understanding
the nonlinear terms in the nbi action until a better understanding is found of how matrix
theory behaves in the large n limit.

there are many other problems to which the work described here can be applied.

it
would be nice to see how far the results of [53] can be generalized to describe absorption
of particles by dp-branes at leading and higher orders. the relationship between t-duality
and spatial dependence of background supergravity elds is also an interesting question for
further investigation. it would also be interesting to carry out a more systematic analysis
of the s-duality of the linear terms we have found in the nbi action; this should give a
complete set of results for the s-duality transformation properties of all the short operators
in maximally supersymmetric 4d sym theory.

here, str denotes a symmetrized trace in which we average over all possible orderings
of the matrices the trace, with commutators being treated as a unit. time derivatives
are taken with respect to minkowski time t.
indices i, j, . . . run from 1 through 9, while
indices a, b, . . . run from 0 through 9.
in these expressions we have used the denitions

current components m +ijklm, m ijklmn, and in fact comparison with supergravity suggests
that these should be 0 for any matrix theory conguration.

the higher multipole moments of these currents contain one set of terms which are
found by including the matrices x k1, . . . , x kn into the symmetrized trace as well as more
complicated spin contributions. we may write these as

t ij(i1ik) = sym (t ij ; x i1, . . . , x ik) + t ij(i1ik)
