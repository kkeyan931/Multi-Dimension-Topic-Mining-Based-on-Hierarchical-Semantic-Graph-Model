0. introduction

one of the most fascinating applications of the kac-moody theory is the use of ane
lie algebras and their groups to exhibit hidden symmetries of soliton equations. in 1981

m. sato [19] and drinfeld-sokolov [6] (see also [7]) discovered fundamental links between
soliton equations and innite-dimensional lie groups. in an important sequence of papers

[2], [3], [4], date, jimbo, kashiwara and miwa gave a construction of the kadomtsev-
petviashvili and korteweg-de vries hierarchies based on the representation theory of ane
kac-moody algebras. the ane algebra a produces the kp hierarchy, while the kdv

date, jimbo, kashiwara and miwa used the vertex operator realization of the basic
highest weight module, which was discovered earlier by lepowsky and wilson [17]. in this

hierarchy is linked to csl2.
realization for csl2, the space of the basic module is identied with the polynomial algebra

in innitely many variables x = (x1, x3, x5, . . .). a completion of this space is interpreted
as the space of  -functions. in this framework, the backlund transformation that raises the

soliton number of an n-soliton  -function, is given by the exponential of a vertex operator.
the casimir operator equation

(   ) = 0

decomposes in a hierarchy of pdes in hirota form.

the sine-gordon equation

uxt = sin(u)

(0.1)

(0.2)

is of great signicance to both mathematics and physics. this equation appeared rst in
geometry and describes the surfaces of constant negative curvature in r3. the physical
importance of the sine-gordon equation is related to the fact that it is a soliton equation
which is manifestly lorentz-invariant.

1

the sine-gordon equation played a special role in the development of the soliton
theory. the backlund transformation method, which is a precursor for the lie theory

approach, was rst developed in the geometric setup for this equation. before the con-
nection between soliton equations and innite-dimensional lie algebras was discovered in
1980s, mandelstam wrote a paper [18] on quantized sine-gordon equation, in which he

used operators somewhat similar to the vertex operators.

from the akns method [1] it is known that the sine-gordon equation is related to

csl2, but the representation-theoretic interpretation of this equation was missing.

the main goal of the present paper is to ll this gap. our starting point is the following

observation. from the original hirotas paper [13] we know that the sine-gordon equation
(0.2) can be written as a system of equations in hirota form on a pair of functions (0, 1)

(cid:26) dxdt(0  0  1  1) = 0

dxdt(0  1) = 01,

(0.3)

where u is related to (0, 1) by u = 4 arctan(cid:16) 1

0(cid:17). to describe the soliton solutions in

terms of  -functions, we to put 0 and 1 together into  = 0 + i1. then the n -soliton
solution for the sine-gordon is given by (cf. [13]):

 = 0 + i1 =

= 1+

nxk=1 x1j1<...<jkn

j1 . . . jk ik y1r<sk(cid:18) zjr  zjs
zjr + zjs(cid:19)2

exp   kxs=1

z1

js ! t +  kxs=1

zjs! x!

with real-valued js and zj s.

if we compare this with the expression for the n -soliton solution for the kdv hierarchy

[11], [14]

 = 1 +

nxk=1 x1j1<...<jkn

zjr + zjs(cid:19)2
j1 . . . jk y1r<sk(cid:18) zjr  zjs

exp xmnodd

  kxs=1

zm

js! xm ,

then it becomes clear that time t in the sine-gordon equation is nothing but variable
x1 missing in the kdv picture! the correct set of variables should include both pos-
itive and negative odd integers: x = (. . . , x3, x1, x1, x3, . . .). we shall use the symbols
zodd, zev, nodd, nev to denote odd/even integers/natural numbers.

our extended hierarchy will be completely symmetric in positive and negative direc-

tions. this means that the csl2-module that we need to construct should not be of the

highest/lowest weight. however, the casimir operator is a crucial ingredient for the con-
struction of the hierarchy of dierential equations (see (0.1) above). formally, this operator

2

is well-dened only for the highest/lowest weight modules. nevertheless, we are still able
to use the casimir operator in our situation.

dierential operators on the algebra of polynomials c[x1, x3, x5, . . .].

in the vertex operator realization of the basic highest weight module, csl2 acts by
representcsl2 by the same dierential operators, but now acting on the algebra of dierential

operators in variables x1, x3, x5, . . ., by left multiplication. the algebra of dierential
operators is isomorphic to the weyl algebra w generated by pi, qj,
i, j  nodd with
relations

in this paper we

pipj = pjpi,

qiqj = qj qi,

piqj  qj pi = ciij  1,

ci  c\{0}.



though the weyl algebra is non-commutative, still the partial dierentiations

pi
are well-dened. this allows us to view the elements of the weyl algebra as functions

,


qj
on a quantized space.

the weyl algebra has a poincare-birkho-witt decomposition

w = c[q1, q3, . . .]  c[p1, p3, . . .].

since both subalgebras c[q1, q3, . . .] and c[p1, p3, . . .] are commutative, there is a linear
bijection between w and the polynomial algebra c[. . . , x3, x1, x1, x3, . . .]:

 : w  c[x1, x3, . . .]  c[x1, x3, . . .].

the image of a dierential operator under map  is called the symbol of a dierential

operator (see e.g., [16]).

the idea of our approach is to write a kac-moody group invariant equation on a weyl
algebra element  and then convert it into a hierarchy of partial dierential equations in

hirota form on the symbol  = ( ). then we can use the kac-moody group action to
generate the soliton solutions from the trivial solution  = 1.

the function  = 1 is not anymore a solution of (0.1), since we have changed the
action to be the left multiplication and 1 now represents the identity operator. however,

 = 1 is trivially a solution of

(   )  (   ) = 0.

(0.4)

this algebraic equation transforms into a hierarchy of the non-linear pdes in the variables
x = (. . . , x3, x1, x1, x3, . . .) which contains two kdv subhierarchies going in positive and
negative directions.

3

the simplest new equation in this double kdv hierarchy is the following (cf. (4.34)):

uyt =


x

(uxxy + uxuy + ux)

(0.5)

with x = x1, y = x1, t = x3. this is a generalization of the kdv with two spatial
variables, but dierent from the kadomtsev-petviashvili equation.

the sine-gordon equation can not possibly occur in the double kdv hierarchy (0.4)
since the system of hirota equations (0.3) can not be expressed in terms of  = 0 + i1
alone.

using the boson-fermion correspondence we construct skew casimir operators that

split  into even and odd parts (proposition 2.2). it remains a mystery whether the skew
casimir operators are related to the dirac operator. we construct a hierarchy of equations
by considering skew analogs of (0.4) (see (2.7), (2.8)).

as expected, the sine-gordon equation with respect to the variables x1 and x1 ap-

pears in it, linking the two kdv hierarchies.

here is a brief description of the structure of the paper. in section 1 we construct a
representation of ane lie algebra a on a completion of the weyl algebra w. we also
review the boson-fermion correspondence and the construction of the casimir operator.

in section 2 we consider the reduction of this representation to csl2, introduce the skew

casimir operators and study their properties. in section 3 we show how to convert the skew
casimir operator equations into a generating series of pdes in hirota form and construct
n -soliton solutions for these equations. in the nal section we derive non-linear partial

dierential equations from the hirota equations. we also obtain the leibnitz formula for
the hirota formalism and use it for the treatment of systems of hirota equations.

1. boson-fermion correspondence and representations of a

in the previous works on applications of innite-dimensional lie algebras to soliton

equations the main idea is to represent lie algebras by dierential operators. in this setting
the casimir operator equation becomes an innite hierarchy of non-linear pdes in hirota

form. the fact that the casimir operator commutes with the lie algebra allows one to
construct soliton solutions of this hierarchy.

4

the approach that we take here is to use the action not on the space of functions,
but rather on the weyl algebra, or, equivalently, on the space of dierential operators

themselves.

we consider the weyl algebra w, an associative algebra with 1 generated by the

elements pi, qi, i  n with the dening relations

piqj  qj pi = 

4
j

ij1,

pipj = pj pi,

qiqj = qjqi,

i, j  n.

(1.1)

the scaling factor  4
j in the rst of these relations is chosen to put the vertex operators
considered below, in a more symmetric form. essentially, w is a factor of the universal

enveloping algebra of the heisenberg algebra in which the central element is identied with
1.

the weyl algebra has a natural representation on the space of polynomials in innitely
many variables (fock space) f = c[x1, x2, . . .] by the operators of dierentiation and
multiplication:

pj 7 

2
j


xj

,

qj 7 2xj,

j  n.

thus the weyl algebra can be also interpreted as the algebra of dierential operators on

f .

in spite of the non-commutativity of the weyl algebra, the partial derivatives 
pj

, 
qj
are well dened (which follows from the fact that the relations (1.1) survive the partial

dierentiation). these partial derivatives are inner derivations of w ([5], section 4.6):


pj

(f (q, p)) =

j
4

[qj , f (q, p)] ,


qj

(f (q, p)) = 

j
4

[pj, f (q, p)] ,

f (q, p)  w.

(1.2)

here q = (q1, q2, . . .), p = (p1, p2, . . .).

the exponentials exp( 
pj

)) are the shift operators
pi 7 pi + ij, qi 7 qi, (resp. pi 7 pi, qi 7 qi + ij ), which are well-dened com-
muting automorphisms of w.

),   c, (resp.

exp( 
qj

clearly, an element f (q, p)  w can be written in many ways. we call the normal
form of f (q, p) its presentation in which the generators qis are grouped to the left of pjs in
all monomials. the normal form can be found using the standard poincare-birkho-witt
procedure. it also corresponds to the decomposition w = w   w +, where w  (resp.
w + ) is an abelian algebra generated by q1, q2, . . . (resp. p1, p2, . . .).

the subalgebra w  (resp. w +) is isomorphic to the algebra of polynomials in in-
nitely many variables c[x1, x2, . . .] (resp. c[x1, x2, . . .] ). consider the isomorphism of

5

vector spaces

 : w   w +  c[x1, x2, . . . x1, x2, . . .],

 (f (q1, q2, . . .)g(p1, p2, . . .)) = f (x1, x2, . . .)g(x1, x2, . . .).

the map  coincides with the notion of a symbol of a dierential operator expressed in the
weyl algebra language. this map allows us to convert the elements of the weyl algebra

into ordinary functions in commuting variables.

we dene the normally ordered product : f g : of f (q, p) and g(q, p) to be

: f (q, p)g(q, p) := 1 ((f (q, p))(g(q, p))) .

we will consider a z-grading of w = 
nz

wn by assigning degrees to the generators

as follows:

deg(pi) = i,

deg(qi) = i,

i  n.

next we introduce a completion w of the weyl algebra, in which the vertex operators will
be later dened. we set the completion of wn to be

w n = yi0,j0

i+j=n

w 

i  w +

j

and dene w as

w = 
nz

w n.

(1.3)

(1.4)

it follows from the poincare-birkho-witt argument that w has a well-dened structure
of an associative algebra.

in physics literature the generators of the weyl algebra pi, qi are called free bosons.
the boson-fermion correspondence is a way of constructing free fermions out of free bosons
and vice versa ([9],[14]). the free fermions are the generators i, 
i , i  z, of the cliord
algebra c satisfying the relations

proposition 1.1. (cf.

[14], theorem 14.10) the cliord algebra c can be repre-

here the correspondence between two formal series is the correspondence between

their respective components.

note that the components of the vertex operators belong to the algebra b = c[u, u1]
u (um) =

u is interpreted as zu 

w and act on b by left multiplication. the symbol zu 
zmum.

the only dierence between the statement above and theorem 14.10 in [14] is that
here we consider the action of these vertex operators by left multiplication on c[u, u1]w
and not on c[u, u1]  f as dierential operators. proposition 1.1 is thus an immediate
corollary.

the obvious relations between the operator of multiplication by u and the elds

(z), (z)

(z)u = zu(z),

(z)u = z1u(z)

can be rewritten for their components as

ku = uk+1,


ku = u

k+1.

(1.6)

the classical matrix lie algebras can be embedded into cliord algebras and weyl
algebras. it is well-known that this can be also done for the ane kac-moody algebras [8]
and, in particular, for the ane algebra a of innite rank.

the algebra a is a non-trivial one-dimensional central extension of the lie algebra

a of innite matrices with nitely many non-zero diagonals:

a =xi,jz

aijeij

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) n  n |i  j| > n  aij = 0

a = a  c1.

,

the action of a on c[u, u1]  w is determined by the formula:

eij 7(cid:26) i

j
j i



if
if

i 6= j or
i = j  0.

i = j > 0,

using (1.5) we can write a generating series for this action ([14], 14.10.9):

in order to get a connection with the dierential equations in hirota form, we should

also consider the tensor square b  b of the a-module b = c[u, u1]  w.

the key link is the casimir operator ([14], 14.11.2)

 = xkz

k  
k

which acts on a completion b  b and commutes with the a-action ([14], 14.11). to
construct this completion we view w  w as a weyl algebra in twice as many generators

and take its completion as in (1.3), (1.4). the algebra b  b is the tensor product of
w  w with two copies of c[u, u1].

lie algebra g = csl2 has a z2-grading g = g0  g1, where g0 is the principal heisenberg

subalgebra spanned by hj , j  zodd and k, while g1 is spanned by aj + 1
the following lemma is an immediate consequence of the formulas (2.2)-(2.4) above:

2 j,0k, j  z.

lemma 2.1. (i) xu = ux for x  g0,
(ii) xu = ux for x  g1.
this result can also be seen from the realization of elements of g as innite matrices.
the conjugation by u is a shift operator: u1eiju = ei+1,j+1  i,0j,01. it follows from
(2.1) that the elements in g0 are represented by matrices invariant under this shift, while
elements of g1 are represented by anti-invariant matrices.

the subspace 1  w in b is clearly invariant under a and csl2-actions. while the

casimir operator  does not leave the space w  w invariant, it can be easily modied
into an operator 0, for which w  w is invariant:

0 = (1  u)(u1  1).

moreover using the conjugation by 1  uk we obtain a whole family of skew casimir
operators:

k = (1  uk+1)(u1  uk) ,

k  z.

note that the conjugation by elements uk1 produces the same family because  commutes
with u  u.

it is easy to see that

the skew casimir operators k do not anymore commute with the action of a, but

as we see in the following proposition, behave nicely relatively to the subalgebra csl2 in a.

proposition 2.2. (a) for x  g0

(x  1 + 1  x)k = k(x  1 + 1  x),

k  z.

(b) for x  g1

(x  1 + 1  x)k = k(x  1 + 1  x),

k  zodd,

(x  1  1  x)k = k(x  1  1  x),

k  zev.

proof. recall that k = (1uk+1)(u1 uk). part (a) is obvious because xu = ux

for x  g0 by lemma 2.1 and x  1 + 1  x commutes with the casimir operator .

verication of (b) is also straightforward. suppose that x  g1 and k is odd. by
lemma 2.1, x commutes with the even powers of u and anticommutes with the odd powers

of u. thus

if k is even then

(x  1 + 1  x)(1  uk+1)(u1  uk)

= (1  uk+1)(x  1 + 1  x)(u1  uk)

= (1  uk+1)(u1  uk)(x  1 + 1  x).

(x  1  1  x)(1  uk+1)(u1  uk)

= (1  uk+1)(x  1 + 1  x)(u1  uk)

= (1  uk+1)(u1  uk)(x  1  1  x).

let  =  (z1, z2, . . .) be a formal laurent series in nitely many formal real variables

z1, z2, . . . with coecients in w. let  (z1, z2, . . .) be the complex conjugate of  .

proposition 2.3. the sets of solutions  (z1, z2, . . .) of equations

and

(   )k = k(    ),

k  zodd,

(   )k = k(    ),

k  zev,

(2.5)

(2.6)

are invariant under the transformation

 (z1, z2, . . .) 7  (z1, z2, . . . , z) =  (z1, z2, . . .) exp (i(z)) ,

10

where   r and z is a formal real variable.

the equations (2.5) and (2.6) are understood here as equalities of the corresponding

w  w-valued coecients in the formal laurent series.

proof. since the components of (z) represent the elements of g1, we get from

proposition 2.2 that for k  zodd

exp (i(z))  exp (i(z)) k = exp (i ((z)  1 + 1  (z))) k

= k exp (i ((z)  1 + 1  (z))) = k exp (i(z))  exp (i(z)) ,

and in a similar way for k  zev:

exp (i(z))  exp (i(z)) k = k exp (i(z))  exp (i(z)) .

suppose that  is a solution of the equation (2.5)

(   )k = k(    ),

k  zodd.

then for   =  exp (i(z)) we have

(    )k = (   ) (exp (i(z))  exp (i(z))) k

= (   )k (exp (i(z))  exp (i(z)))

= k(    ) (exp (i(z))  exp (i(z))) = k(( )  ( )).

thus   is also a solution of (2.5). the case of (2.6) is completely analogous.

corollary 2.4. the series  = (1 + 1i(z1)) . . . (1 + n i(zn )) in formal real vari-

ables z1, . . . , zn with 1, . . . , n  r is a solution for both (2.5) and (2.6).

proof. trivially  = 1 is a solution for both equations. thus by the above proposition,
 = exp (1i(z1)) . . . exp (n i(zn )) satises (2.5) and (2.6). finally, exp (i(z)) =
1 + i(z) because 2(z) = 0 ([14], 14.11.15), and the claim of the corollary follows.

consider the real and the imaginary parts of  : 0(z1, z2, . . .) = re( ), 1(z1, z2, . . .) =

im( ). the equations (2.5) and (2.6) can be rewritten as the systems

and

(0  1 + 1  0)k + k(0  1 + 1  0) = 0

(cid:26) (0  0  1  1)k  k(0  0  1  1) = 0
(cid:26) (0  0 + 1  1)k  k(0  0 + 1  1) = 0

(0  1  1  0)k + k(0  1  1  0) = 0

11

k  zodd

(2.7)

k  zev.

(2.8)

the requirement that  and z are real may be dropped if we apropriately adjust the

statement of proposition 2.3:

proposition 2.5. the sets of solutions (0, 1) of the systems (2.7) and (2.8) are

invariant under the transformation

(0, 1) 7 ( 

0,  

1) = (0, 1)(cid:18)

(z)

(z)

1 (cid:19)

where z is a formal variable and   c.

the proof parallels the one of proposition 2.3.

3. hirota bilinear equations and their solutions

the dierential nature of the weyl algebra is encoded in its dening relations (1.1).

in this section we shall see how to convert purely algebraic equations

(   )k = k(    ),

k  zodd,

(   )k = k(    ),

k  zev,

into a hierarchy of dierential equations in hirota form on the dequantized functions
0 = (0), 1 = (1).

when a product of two functions in w is written in the normally ordered form,

expressions involving partial derivatives (1.2) appear. one special case of this procedure
is recorded in the following lemma and will be later used in our calculations.

lemma 3.1. let p, q be generators of the weyl algebra satisfying pq  qp = c  1.

then for  =  (q, p) we have

and



exp(zp) =(cid:26)exp(cid:18)cz
 exp(zq) = exp(zq)(cid:26)exp(cid:18)cz

q(cid:19) (cid:27) exp(zp)
p(cid:19) (cid:27) .



here z is a formal variable and the above equalities are interpreted as equalities of formal
power series.

proof. we shall prove the second identity, the rst will then follow by applying the

automorphism p 7 q, q 7 p. from (1.2) we get that

 (q, p)q = q (q, p) + c

=(cid:18)q + c



p(cid:19)  (q, p).

 
p

12

to complete the proof, we apply the above equality to the taylor expansion of exp(zq):

by induction we obtain

 (q, p).



 (q, p)qn =(cid:18)q + c

p(cid:19)n
 (q, p) exp(zq) = exp(cid:18)zq + cz
= exp(zq)(cid:26)exp(cid:18)cz



p(cid:19)  (q, p)
p(cid:19)  (q, p)(cid:27) .



at this point we are ready to transform (2.7) and (2.8) into a hierarchy of hirota

bilinear equations. note that the terms involved in these equations are of the form
(f  g)k  k(f  g). we shall work with such expressions using the generating series
(f  g)(z)  (z)(f  g), f  g  w  w. denote the variables in the rst copy of w by
q

dierentiation is dened as

p (dx, dy, . . .) [f (x, y, . . .)  g(x, y, . . .)] :=

we use the reduction to the subalgebra csl2 in a to construct solutions of (2.5)

and (2.6). we see from (2.2)-(2.4) that this reduction involves only variables pj, qj with
j  nodd, so the solutions we get in corollary 2.4 do not depend on the even-indexed
variables. thus in (3.2) we may set dpj = 0, dqj = 0 for j  nev. in (3.2) all qs are
collected to the left of all ps and all qs are to the left of all ps. because of that we can
easily evaluate the image of this expression under the map , which gives us:

and x = (. . . , x3, x1, x1, x3, . . .). here r(z) is a laurent series in z and a taylor series
in xj. the coecients of this series are hirota dierential operators.

now we can rewrite (2.7) and (2.8) as the generating series for the hierarchy of hirota

bilinear equations on 0 = (0) and 1 = (1):

res(cid:0)zj r(z)(cid:1) (0  0  1  1) = 0,
res(cid:0)zj r+(z)(cid:1) (0  1 + 1  0) = 0,
res(cid:0)zj r(z)(cid:1) (0  0 + 1  1) = 0,

as usual, the residue denotes the coecient at z1 of a formal laurent series. the coe-
cient at each monomial in xs in the formal equations above is a hirota bilinear equation
on 0 and 1. we shall study the hirota equations that occur here in the next section.
now we turn to describing solutions of this hierarchy.

from corollary 2.4 it follows that

0 + i1 =  ((1 + 1i(z1)) . . . (1 + n i(zn )))

is a solution of (3.3) - (3.6). from [14] we get that the right hand side converges to

as we shall see in the next section, this hierarchy contains the sine-gordon equation,

as well as two copies of the korteweg - de vries hierarchy.

4. the kdv  sine-gordon  kdv hierarchy

in this section we transform the hirota equations (3.3)-(3.6) into non-linear pdes. we
show that among other equations, this hierarchy contains the sine-gordon equation, the

kdv and the modied kdv equations. we begin by listing some of the hirota equations
that are coecients at monomials in (3.3)-(3.6) (we multiply them by appropriate constants
to avoid fractional coecients). for simplicity of notations, we write dj for dxj .

( d1d1(0  0  1  1) = 0

(d1d1  1) (1  0) = 0

and set 1 = 0. applying lemma 4.1, we transform this system into

( (1  2)d1d1(0  0)  d1d1(  ) 2

d1d1(0  0) + (11()  ) 2

0 = 0

0 = 0.

interpreting this as a system of linear equations on d1d1(0  0) and  2

which is essentially the second equation in the mkdv hierarchy constructed by the akns
method [1].

the double kdv hierarchy.

it can be easily seen that the hierarchy (3.3)-(3.6) is
invariant under the transformation z 7 z1, xj 7 xj, i.e., it is symmetric in the positive
and negative directions.

if in (3.3) and (3.4) we set xk = 0 for k < 0 and consider non-negative values of j,

then

p (z) = exp

(4.32)

the series (4.30) is the kdv hierarchy [4], [14] in variables x1, x3, x5 . . .. by symmetry, the
second copy of the kdv hierarchy extends in the negative direction x1, x3, . . . . these
two kdv hierarchies are linked together by the sine-gordon equation (4.18) which involves
variables x1 and x1. the soliton solutions for the double kdv hierarchy are given by
(3.7) with purely imaginary values of 1, . . . n .

remark 4.2. another way to construct this subhierarchy is to consider the casimir

operator a for ane kac-moody algebra csl2 (see [14]) acting on w  w. the double

kdv hierarchy then arises from the equation

(   )a = a(   ).

the double kdv hierarchy that we obtain here contains more than just two copies
of the kdv hierarchy. it also contains equations that involve both positive and negative
variables. the simplest such an equation on the function  = 0 + i1 is

(cid:0)d1d3  4d1d3

1 + 3d2

1(cid:1) (   ) = 0,

(4.33)

which follows from (4.3), (4.4), (4.7) and (4.8). a similar equation (without the last
term) appears in the d(1)
4 -hierarchy [15], but the solutions constructed here and in [15] are
inequivalent.

which is a generalization of the kdv with two spatial variables, but dierent from the
kadomtsev-petviashvili equation.

it is interesting to note that the same equation appears in our hierarchy in a dierent

way. if we combine (4.3), (4.4) with (4.9) and (4.11) then we get

(cid:0)d1d3  d1d3

1 + 3d2

1(cid:1) (0  0) = 0

20

(4.35)

and

(cid:0)d1d3  d1d3

these can be transformed into (4.33) by rescaling the variables xj = 1
