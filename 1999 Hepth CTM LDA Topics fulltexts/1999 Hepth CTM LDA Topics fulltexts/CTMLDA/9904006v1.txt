arguments presented in an earlier paper, demonstrating the breakdown of global supersymmetry
in hawking radiation from a generic four dimensional black hole with infalling massless scalar and
spinor particles, are reexamined. careful handling of the grassmann-valued spinorial supersym-
metry parameter is shown to lead to a situation wherein supersymmetry may not actually break,
provided certain commutators vanish. a comparative analysis in at spacetime at nite temperature
is also presented.

i. introduction

it is now almost universally accepted that any generic black hole with infalling quantum matter elds radiates
like a black body in equilibrium at a temperature tbh  /2, where,  is the surface gravity at the horizon of the
black hole [1]. consequently, infalling bose elds are radiated out in a thermal bose-einstein (planckian) distribution
(modulo some grey-body factors) while fermions are radiated out in a fermi-dirac distribution. on the basis of this
alone, one might expect that the supersymmetry manifest at past null innity in a system of bosons and fermions will
not survive such radiation. this expectation seems to be borne out in detail in an investigation performed two years
ago [2], in which the standard criterion of spontaneous supersymmetry breakdown is used, namely the non-vanishing
(or otherwise) of the vacuum expectation value of the supersymmetry variation of a fermionic operator at future
null innity. the evaluation of the vacuum expectation value (vev) in ref. [2] follows hawkings original approach
involving a zero temperature quantum eld theory in the black hole background, and is generic in nature. however,
in that derivation, as elsewhere, one has tended to ignore the fact that the spinorial supersymmetry parameter is
actually an element of a grassmann algebra (an a-number) rather than a c-number.
in other words, unlike a c-
number parameter which commutes with all operators of the theory, the supersymmetry parameter anticommutes
with fermionic operators instead. clearly, this may have serious implications for evaluation of greens functions and
the like involving strings of fermionic and bosonic operators, such as the issue of supersymmetry breaking entails.
our concern here is with possible ramications for black hole radiance. recall that the phenomenon of black hole
radiance is based upon particle creation in the gravitational eld of a black hole. thus, evaluation of vevs of operators
dened at future null innity will involve matrix elements of such operators between states (at future null innity)
of non-zero fermion number. it is here that a naive handling of the supersymmetry parameter is most likely to dier
from a careful one. if sharp disparities arise, the conventional wisdom that black hole radiance breaks supersymmetry,
is bound to be challenged.

section ii of the paper is a brief recapitulation of the main tenets of the earlier work. in section iii, we attempt a
more careful evaluation of the relevant vacuum expectation value, to see if supersymmetry can indeed be preserved in
black hole radiance. in section iv, a comparative analysis of the supersymmetric model in at spacetime in presence
of a heat bath at a nite temperature is presented. our conclusions and outlook are presented in the nal section.

ii. the earlier formulation surveyed

we focus on a situation where, at past null innity (i), there exists a globally supersymmetric model of nonin-
teracting massless complex scalar and chiral spinor elds. now, any state on i will evolve into a state on the event
horizon (h+), belonging to one of two mutually exclusive (in absence of backreaction) classes, viz., those which are
purely outgoing, i.e., have zero cauchy data on h+ and support on i+, and those which have zero cauchy data
on i+ and support on h+. as is well-known [1], an inherent ambiguity in the latter is chiey responsible for the
thermalization of the radiation received at i+.

the scalar and spinor elds in our model have the following expansion (at i),

where, the {fk} are complete orthonormal sets of solutions of the respective eld equations, with positive frequencies

by the requirement

is not unique, because of the inherent ambiguity in dening positive frequency for the {qk}; in fact, one can write
|0+i = |0ii|0hi with the unprimed (primed) operators acting on |0i > (|0h >). a supersymmetry charge q(i+) may
indeed be dened, analogously to eqn. (2), in terms of the unprimed operators, and that q(i+)|0+i = 0. such a
charge also satises the n = 1 superalgebra at i+.

(7)

the issue that we now wish to focus on is whether the radiated system of particles has n = 1 spacetime supersym-
metry. to address this question, recall that vacuum expectation values (vevs) of observables at future null innity
are dened by [1]

h o i  h0| o |0i = t r ( o)

(8)

where,  is the density operator. the trace essentially averages over the (nonunique) states going through the horizon,
thus rendering the vevs of observables (at i+) free of ambiguities. we also recall that a sucient condition for
spontaneous supersymmetry breaking is the existence of a fermionic operator o which, upon a supertransformation,

2

yields an operator with non-vanishing vev, i.e., h so i
observables o(i+),

6= 0. thus, if one is able to show that for all fermionic

h so(i+) i = 0 ,

(9)

then we are guaranteed that the outgoing particles form a supermultiplet.

however, this is not the case, as is not dicult to see; for, consider the supercharge operator itself at i+. using

the supersymmetry algebra, it can be shown that

where p  is the momentum operator of the theory and  the spinorial supersymmetry parameter. in our free eld
theory, the rhs of (10) is trivial to calculate, using eq. (6) above, so that we obtain, suppressing obvious indices,

h s q (i+) i =  h p (i+) i ,

(11)

thus, supersymmetry is seemingly spontaneously broken in the sense described above, so long as the bogoliubov
coecients b,f are non-vanishing in fact, we know from hawkings seminal work [1] that

(12)

here,  is the surface gravity of the black hole, and b,f

the absorption cross sections for bosons, fermions respectively.

iii. a more careful evaluation

using the denition (8) above, the aim is to evaluate the trace t r (cid:0)  [  q , q ] (cid:1). treating  q as a bosonic

operator and using the cyclicity of traces, it is easy to see that,

h so i = t r (cid:0) [ q ,  ]  q (cid:1) .

(13)

thus, the issue of supersymmetry breakdown now depends crucially on whether the density operator  commutes with
the supersymmetry generator q at i+. as an operator relation this is not obvious since we do not know the density
operator as a function of the basic eld operators ab,f , bb,f . in hawkings approach, one can only unambiguously
determine the diagonal elements of the density matrix. one would expect the determination of such elements to be
enough to ascertain whether the vev h s q i is non-vanishing.
the basic point of departure from earlier approaches (including ours) is the property that for any fermionic operator
o , o = o. that is to say that {, af} = 0 and similarly for bf . it follows that, for normalized states (at i+)
with nf

k fermions with momentum k, we must have

hnf

k |  |nf

k i = ()nf

k  .

(14)

in our earlier approach [2], the rhs of eq. (14) would not have contained the rst factor. this does have an immediate
import for our calculation of h so i above in eq. (10). rather than expanding the commutator in the variation s q
as done above, we follow our earlier step eq. (8) of using the supersymmetry algebra and rewriting (8) as given in eq.
(10),

h s q (i+) i = t r (cid:0)  p (i+)  (cid:1) .

(15)

the hilbert space of this non-interacting theory h  hb  hf so that, changing to the occupation number basis
of the innite system of uncoupled bose and fermi oscillators, labelled by momentum k , the states are expressed as
|nb
k , nf

k i. assuming without loss of generality, a discrete momentum spectrum, eq. (15) may be expressed as

(16)

since the relevant density matrix elements are uniquely determined by states at future innity (the horizon states
being averaged over) where the system of particles are still non-interacting, the density operator can be factorized as
 = b f where b(f ) acts on bosonic (fermionic) states |nb

k i) alone respectively.

recall now the elementary fact that for a given momentum k, nf

k = 0 , 1. using eq. (14), (15) immediately yields

(17)

not surprisingly, bose-fermi pairing, characteristic of supersymmetric theories, seems to appear here as well. thus, if
the density operator does indeed commute with the supersymmetry generator at future asymtopia, the rhs of eq. (17)
would vanish, implying unbroken supersymmetry despite a thermal spectrum of radiated particles. however, even in
the explicit form (17), it is not obvious how this happens. clearly, some elements of the bosonic and fermionic density
matrices would have to be related in ways constrained by supersymmetry. e.g., if one takes the following ansatz
for the density matrix elements (motivated once again by the fact that our system is entirely non-interacting, and
possibly supersymmetric)

(18)

for a real positive , one easily obtains the desired result h s q i = 0.

iv. supersymmetry in minkowski space at finite temperature

a comparison, with the behaviour of the system of massless supersymmetric bosons and fermions in at spacetime
at a nite temperature 1, is in order, taking recourse once again to (14). in this case, we have full knowledge of
the density operator as a function of the basic eld operators [3],

 = e h /t r eh ,

(19)

where, the hamiltonian h = h b (ab, bb) + h f (af , bf ). it is straightforward to see that the thermal average

now,

h s q i = t r {  h e h}/t r e h .

t r {  h e h} = 

d
d

t r  e h .

(20)

(21)

therefore, to obtain preservation of supersymmetry at a non-zero temperature, all we have to prove is that t r  e h
is independent of .

to see this, we use the fact that the hamiltonian h is actually a sum of an innite number of bosonic and fermionic

(spin 1/2) harmonic oscillator hamiltonians, each at a frequency k = |k|. thus,

t r  e h = x

(22)

it is clear that there is a term by term cancellation for each value of nb
k in the rhs of eq. (22), except for the rst term
for nb
k = 0, which of course is independent of . thus, just because bosons and fermions obey dierent statistics at
a nite temperature, it is hasty to conclude that supersymmetry is broken. this fact was rst pointed out by l. van
hove [4] and subsequently by other workers [5]. our formulation here makes only implicit use of the klein operator
()

n f in contrast to its explicit use in those earlier papers.

v. conclusions

for the case of the generic black hole, we have not been able to establish the ansatz (18) from rst principles.
but, its intuitive appeal is unmistakeable, especially in view of the fact that the diagonal density matrix elements,
in this simple non-interacting situation, can only be a function of the momentum k and the surface gravity . this
also follows from the observation that the rhs of (17) can be expressed in terms of the bogoliubov b,f coecients
which themselves are only functions of k and . however, it may be worthwhile to demonstrate this beyond doubt
by calculating these coecients for a specic black hole metric.
if (18) holds, then our main conclusion is that
black hole radiance does indeed mimic black body radiation (generalized to the supersymmetric case) with unbroken
supersymmetry, at least for the non-interacting system under consideration. the generalization to the interacting
situation would entail explicit perturbative computations, but, in all likelyhood, lead to the same basic inference.
indeed, this is what ensues in at space nite temperature perturbative eld theory [5]. as remarked earlier, this
conclusion invalidates straightforward use of the notion that black hole radiance breaks supersymmetry. of course,
the black holes in question are not supersymmetric in the technical sense in that there is no covariantly conserved
killing spinor associated with them as classical solutions. if they were supersymmetric, they would most likely be
extremal and therefore not even radiate.

on the other hand, if indeed our ansatz (18) breaks down, and one cannot actually prove in any other way that
the rhs of (17) vanishes, then one might be led to infer that there is more to black hole radiance than merely a
resemblance to black body radiation in at spacetime, albeit a close one. this would be a rather interesting situation,
warranting further investigation.
