1 introduction

the important physical consequences of maldacena conjecture [1] on the equivalence (or

duality) of the large n limit of su(n) superconformal eld theories in n dimensions and

supergravity on anti de sitter space-time in n + 1 dimensions, adsn+1, attracted a lot of

interest in the recent literature. by supergravity here, one means the tree level approxi-
mation of string or m-theory dened on adsn+1  md, where md is some d-dimensional
compactication space. this conjecture was further elaborated in the works of gubser,

klebanov and polyakov[2] and witten[3]. in this, so called, ads/cft correspondence,

eld correlators of a conformal eld theory on the n dimensional boundary of an anti de

sitter space of dimension n + 1 are dened by the dynamics of elds living inside this

space. the boundary values of these elds, whose dynamics is dened in the bulk, have
the role of sources for the eld correlators of the conformal theory on the boundary.1

the presence of a boundary with non vanishing elds together with the fact that the

metric is singular there may lead to some non standard results, comparing with usual

quantum eld theory, dened in spaces where the elds and eld derivatives either vanish

or have nite limiting values on the boundary. classical actions that dier by total

derivative terms (surface terms), having thus the same equations of motion, may play

dierent roles in the ads/cft correspondence.

in the case of fermionic elds, if one

starts simply with the dirac action as governing the dynamics inside adsn+1

z dn+1xg  (d/  m)  ,

and imposes the equation of motion, (d/  m)  = 0, one obtains a vanishing on shell
action. this would imply a trivial mapping between the bulk theory and the boundary

correlators. a solution to this problem was found by henningson and sfetsos [6], who

showed that a non trivial mapping is possible if one introduces a surface term in the

classical action. soon after that, an interesting interpretation for the role played by this

surface term was found by henneaux [7], showing that the action is minimized by solutions

of the equation of motion only if the surface term is added. thus, the appropriate use

of the variational principle furnishes, in the fermionic case a criterion for choosing the

appropriate boundary term to be included in the action in the ads/cft correspondence.

one important point to be remarked is the relation between the form of the fermionic

action and the need for the surface term. as the fermionic lagrangian is linear in the

eld derivatives, the elds  and  will be canonically conjugate variables. so, as we

are interpreting this fermionic elds as quantum operators one can not arbitrarily x

both of them on the boundary[7]. that is why the action is minimized by the equation

of motion only if one includes an additional surface term. things are dierent for the

scalar eld whose lagrangian is quadratic in the eld derivatives. in this case there is

no problem in requiring that a solution of the equation of motion (just the eld itself not

the eld derivatives) has some arbitrary limiting behavior in the boundary. however, as

we will see, the fact that one can not x the eld and eld time derivative simultaneously

will make it possible again to use the variational principle as a guide for choosing the

appropriate, among dierent actions that imply the same equation of motion in the bulk,

for the ads/cft correspondence. for massless scalar elds, if one chooses the standard

form of the klein gordon action in ads (curved) spacetime

1

2 z dn+1xg   ,

one does not need to introduce surface terms in the classical action in order to obtain

the ads/cft correspondence, as we are going to review on section 2. if instead of this

action, one chooses

1

2 z dn+1xg   ,



(where  is the covariant derivative in ads space) one would get a vanishing generating
functional for the correlators on the boundary. both actions have the same euler lagrange
equation of motion   = 0, and would thus describe the same dynamics in spaces
with elds and eld derivatives vanishing on the boundary. however only the rst one

gives the appropriate mapping in the ads/cft correspondence. the aim of this letter

is to show how the variational principle can be used also in the scalar eld case so as

to select the appropriate action in the ads/cft context.

in section 2 we review the

ads/cft correspondence in the scalar eld case and also make some remarks about

the regularizations that must be introduced in order to have a well dened meaning to

some singular quantities that show up, in particular in the discussion of the variational

3

principle. in section 3 we discuss the case of the (would be) partially integrated action,

show why this action is not minimized by the equations of motion and extend these results

for the case of massive elds. then, in section 4 we present some concluding remarks.

we also included an appendix where we describe the behavior of the eld time derivative

which is useful in our discussion of the variational principle.

2 massless scalar fields on ads/cft and the vari-

ational principle

let us rst consider a (n + 2)-dimensional pseudo-euclidean space-time with coordinates2
(ya) = (y0, y1, ..., yn, yn+1) and metric ab = diag(+,,, ...,, +), so that the measure

y2 = (y0)2 + (yn+1)2 

n

(yi)2,

xi=1

(1)

is preserved under the transformations of the lorentz group so(2,n). the adsn+1 can

then be dened as a submanifold of this (n + 2)-dimensional pseudo-euclidean space-time
such that y2 = b2 = constant . a pair of light cone coordinates can be dened as

u = y0 + iyn+1,

v = y0  iyn+1

(2)

so that y2 = uv  ~y2 = b2. then following witten [3], we set b = 0 and dene (x0, ~x) 
(u1, ~x), so that anti de sitter space-time can be characterized by the measure

ds2 =

(dx0)2
(x0)2 +

(d~x)2
(x0)2 

1

(x0)2

n

x=0

(dx)2

(3)

in the upper half space x0  0 and xi  xi, (i = 1, ..., n) are the coordinates in n-
dimensional euclidean space, en, in the boundary of ads space-time dened by x0 = 0
plus a point at the innity x0 = . the metric in the adsn+1 space is taken as3

g =

1

(x0)2  , g =

1

(x0)n+1 , g = (x0)2 .

(4)

for massless scalar elds in the ads/cft correspondence one assumes that the eld
(x0 , xi ), where i = 1, ..., n on adsn+1 has some boundary value 0( xi ) as x0  0 .

2we follow closely the notation and denitions of petersen [4].
3alternatively, the coordinates on the boundary could be dened to be an n-dimensional minkowski

space.

4

this object will be coupled to a eld o ( xi ), representing the cft on the boundary. the
correlation functions for the o ( xi ) eld will then be calculated from the generator

z [  ] = h expz dnx 0( xi ) o( xi ) i .

(5)

where the integral is dened on the boundary en.

the mapping between the spaces is realized then by associating this generator of cft

correlation functions on the boundary with the on shell value of the classical action of

adsn+1. one introduces the action that governs the dynamics inside the adsn+1 space

as the standard klein gordon action in curved space-time:

i1[] =

1

2 z dn+1xg   .

(6)

the variation of the action i1 when we change the eld  by a small amount   is

formally

i1[] = z dn+1x (g  )  + z dn+1x [g ( ) ]

= z dn+1x g ( )  + z dnx g (0 )  .

(7)

however, the metric and also the eld derivative, as we will see in the next section, are
singular at x0 = 0. thus we need some prescription in order to have a well dened

meaning to these expressions. we consider the last integral in (7) to be calculated near
the boundary, at x0 = . moreover, the variations  of the elds in the bulk are subject

to the condition

|x0= = 0 .

(8)

this condition does not mean that  reaches the limiting value 0 at x0 =  but rather
that we are not varying the eld conguration for x0 <  with respect to the classical

solution. assuming these conditions to hold, the last integral in (7) vanishes and thus the

action is stationary with respect to variations of the eld if the euler lagrange equation

of motion is satised:

 =

1
g

(cid:16)g(cid:17) = 0 .

(9)

the eld (x0 , ~x) inside the adsn+1 space is related to the eld on the boundary

by calculating the greens function that represents the evolution of the eld from its

5

initial value at x0 = 0 to the values inside adsn+1. following [3] one nds

(x0 , ~x ) = c z dnx

(x0)n

((x0)2 + (~x  ~x )2 )n 0(~x) .

the action i1[], eq. (6), with the metric (4) can be rewritten as

i[  ] =

1

2 z dn+1x (cid:16)(x0)n+1 (cid:17) 

1

2 z dn+1x  (cid:16)(x0)n+1 (cid:17) .

(10)

(11)

so, considering the on shell value of the action, the last term vanishes by the equation

of motion whereas the rst one leads to a surface term. using the green function solution

(10) we can write the action as

i[] = 

cn

2 z dnx dnx 0(~x)0(~x)
(~x  ~x )2n

(12)

that generates the appropriate two point functions for the operators o(~x) on the bound-
ary:

(13)

ho(~x)o(~x)i 

1

(~x  ~x )2n .

3 partially integrated scalar field action

now let us see how the previous discussion on ads/cft is modied if instead of action

i1[], eq. (6), we decide to consider the action

i2 [  ] = 

1

2 z dn+1xg    .

(14)

the euler lagrange equation of motion associated with this action is also given by
 = 0, eq. (9), i. e., it is the same as that corresponding to the action (6). in
the standard eld theory case, where one usually assumes that the space does not have a

boundary, both actions would describe the same dynamics.

however, let us see what happens if we repeat the procedure described in the previous

section in order to nd the generator of correlation functions from action i2[]. consid-

ering that the solution for the elds on adsn+1 in terms of the boundary values would be

the same green function as given by eq. (10), since the equation of motion for the elds

described by i2[] is the same as that for the previous action i1[] action we can rewrite

i2 [  ] = 

1

2 z dn+1x  (cid:16)(x0)n+1  (cid:17) ,

(15)

6

and this vanishes on shell. so we would nd a vanishing generator of correlation functions

if we use this action, analogously to the fermionic case discussed in the introduction.

let us now interpret this result in the light of the ideas of reference [7] of appropriately

using the variational principle to take into account the eects of the presence of the

boundary. in the fermionic case the complete solutions for the elds  and  can not

have well dened values on the boundary of ads . the same thing does not happen in the

scalar case, where we can assume the eld to have a well dened value 0 on the boundary,

at least for the massless case. there is however a dierence in the action i2[], eq. (14),

with respect to the previously considered action i1[], eq. (6), concerning the variational

principle. the point is that the action i2 involves second order eld derivatives. for eld

theories whose dynamics is governed by a classical action involving just rst order eld

derivatives, the variational principle states that considering all eld congurations with

xed values (of just the eld itself) on a space time border, the action is minimized by

the one that satises the euler lagrange equation. however, when one considers eld

theories involving higher order eld derivatives one needs in general to x also some of

the derivatives of the elds on the border [8, 9]. let us see what is the variation of action

i2 when we make a small variation  in the eld  :

i2[] = z dn+1x[g ( ) ] +
z dnx[(x0)n+1 (0 ) ] .

1

2 z dnx[(x0)n+1 (0 ) ]

(16)

so, that action would be stationary if, besides satisfying the equation of motion, we

could make  and also  ( 0 ) vanish on the boundary. this would correspond to look

at solutions with well dened values of the eld and also of its time derivative on the

boundary. assuming that the eld has a well dened non vanishing boundary value, let

us look at the derivative of . considering the eld in the adsn+1 space as given by the

green function, eq. (10), we calculate 0 :

0 (x0 , ~x ) =

nc

x0 z dnx
 2nc z dnx

(x0)n

((x0)2 + (~x  ~x )2 )n 0(~x)
((x0)2 + (~x  ~x )2 )n+1 0(~x) .

(x0)n+1

(17)

7

choosing the normalization constant to be c = (n/)n, we nd (see the appendix):

0 (x0 , ~x )(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)x00

=

n
x0 0(~x) 

2n

x0 (cid:18) n

n + 1(cid:19)

n
2

0(~x) ,

(18)

so that the derivative of the eld  behaves as (x0)10 near the boundary. so, as we

require the eld  to have a well dened nite value 0 on the boundary, the derivative
0 is not dened there essentially because of the singular nature of the metric at x0  0.
a regularized meaning to i2[], eq. (16), is possible if consider again the surface integrals
to be dened at x0 =  and assume the condition |x0= = 0, eq. (8), to hold. if we
were dealing with just classical objects there would be no objection to adding to (8) the

extra condition

(0)|x0= = 0 .

(19)

in this case the usual prescription of the variational principle including derivatives of the

elds up to second order [8] would be satised and thus the action i2 would be minimized

by the solutions of the euler lagrange equations. however, inserting the equation of

motion in the action i2[] we would nd a vanishing boundary term contribution. so that

this action would lead to vanishing correlators in the ads/cft correspondence.

the point is that we are considering the classical action just as an approximation for

the quantum action. thus the eld  and its time derivative 0 are to be taken as

quantum operators corresponding to a canonical pair of non commuting variables. so

we can not impose that  and 0 vanish at the same time, which would violate the

uncertainty principle. as we are xing the limiting value of the eld, we can not assume

the condition (0 ) = 0 to hold on the boundary and the last term of equation (16) is

non vanishing. therefore the action i2[], eq. (14), is not minimized by the congurations
that satisfy the equation of motion  = 0, eq. (9), as long as we consider the eld
and its derivative as quantum operators. if one decides, as in the fermionic case [7], to

add to the action i2 a surface term that compensates for the variation of the action one

would nd that the appropriate one is just

m[] =

1

2 z dn+1xg  (cid:16)  (cid:17) .

(20)

that gives trivially i2 + m = i1 showing then that the analysis of the variational

principle indicates that indeed the action i1 is the appropriate one for calculating the eld

correlators on the boundary in the ads/cft correspondence.

8

it is interesting to mention that alternatively, one could have imposed that the deriva-

tive 0 to be well dened on the boundary with the price that the eld 0 itself would

not be xed, so one would still nd non vanishing boundary terms. this alternative case

should correspond to neumann boundary conditions. it is even possible to discuss a gen-

eralized boundary condition where the condition is imposed on a linear combination of

0 and 0. the calculations of the ads greens functions for these two cases have been

discussed recently by minces and rivelles [10].

now, let us see if the presence of mass would change our conclusions. if we introduce

a mass term

im [] =

1

2 z dn+1x m22 ,

(21)

into actions i1[], eq. (6), and i2[], eq. (14), the equation of motion is now is the

massive klein gordon and one nds the solution [3, 4]

(x0 , ~x ) = c z dnx

(x0)n++

((x0)2 + (~x  ~x )2 )n++
(x0)n+2+

0(~x)

= (x0)+ c z dnx

((x0)2 + (~x  ~x )2 )n++

0(~x) ,

(22)

where + is the highest root of ( + n) = m2.

note that the factor of 0(~x) in the integrand of the above equation in the limit

x0  0 corresponds to an n-dimensional delta function, since



(2 + ~x2)

corresponds to n(~x) up to a normalization, if one guarantees that 2  n =  > 0. so
we see that on the boundary, x0  0, the eld (x0, ~x) has the asymptotic behavior

(x0, ~x)  (x0)+ 0(~x).

(23)

now, the two point correlation functions for the operators o(~x) with conformal dimen-
sion  = n + + on the boundary are given by:

ho(~x)o(~x)i 

1

(~x  ~x )2n+2+

.

(24)

as the mass term does not involve eld derivatives, there will be no extra surface term

in i2 . then all the previous discussion about the variational principle remains the same

and action i2 is ruled out by the impossibility of xing at the same time 0 and  (up

to a scale factor) on the boundary.

9

4 conclusions

we have seen here that the idea of reference [7] of using the minimum action principle as

a criterion for selecting a classical action that will describe the mapping between the ads

space and the conformal theory on the boundary also works properly in the scalar eld

case. in contrast to the fermionic case, the eld can be completely xed on the boundary.

however, partially integrated actions involving the second order eld derivative would be

minimized only if one requires the additional condition of xing the eld derivative on the

boundary. this condition is not possible for canonically conjugate quantum elds. so the

variational principle, together with the quantum ingredient of the uncertainty principle

rules out all the lagrangians that would lead to vanishing correlation functions.

the integrand of the rst term in (17) behaves as an n-dimensional delta function times
0(~x) which implies a behavior like (1/x0)(x0, ~x). the second term has the same behav-
ior in the limit x0  0, although this may be not transparent in the above expression. to
have a clue of this, let us recall a representation for the one-dimensional delta function
