we discuss the weak gravitational eld created by isolated matter sources
in the randall-sundrum brane-world. in the case of two branes of opposite
tension, linearized brans-dicke (bd) gravity is recovered on either wall, with
dierent bd parameters. on the wall with positive tension the bd parameter
is larger than 3000 provided that the separation between walls is larger than
4 times the ads radius. for the wall of negative tension the bd parameter is
always negative. in either case, shadow matter from the other wall gravitates
upon us. for equal newtonian mass, light deection from shadow matter is
25 % weaker than from ordinary matter. for the case of a single wall of posi-
tive tension, einstein gravity is recovered on the wall to leading order, and if
the source is stationary the eld stays localized near the wall. we calculate
the leading kaluza-klein corrections to the linearized gravitational eld of a
non-relativistic spherical object and nd that the metric is dierent from the
schwarzschild solution at large distances. we believe that our linearized solu-
tion corresponds to the eld far from the horizon after gravitational collapse
of matter on the brane.

it has recently been shown [1] that something very similar to four dimensional einstein
gravity exists on a domain wall (or 3-brane) of positive tension which is embedded in a
ve dimensional anti-de sitter space (ads). the striking feature about this model is that an
eective dimensional reduction occurs without the need of compactifying the fth dimension.
the reason is that kaluza-klein (kk) excitations, which have nonvanishing momentum
in the fth direction, are suppressed near the brane. thus, even though the kk modes
are light, they almost decouple from matter elds - which are constrained to live on the
wall. gravitational interactions amongst matter elds are mediated predominantly by the
zero mode, which is often described as a bound state of gravity on the wall. the case of
two parallel domain walls, one with positive tension and another with negative tension, has
also been discussed in an attempt to solve the much debated hierarchy problem [2]. the
possibility that we may be living in a brane is rather tantalizing, and many questions arise
as to how gravity should look like in such a world. what are the corrections to einstein
gravity? how does the shadow matter living in the other brane gravitate upon us? what
is the nal state of gravitational collapse? exploring some of these aspects will be the
subject of the present paper.

some attention has been devoted to cosmological [3,4], as well as nonperturbative vacuum
solutions [5,6] in this context. in randall and sundrums solution the metric induced on the
brane is at. however, straightforward generalizations can be obtained in which the induced
metric is any vacuum solution of the four dimensional einsteins equations. generalizations
of this sort where given in [5] and [6], where the plane wave and the schwarzschild solutions
were considered. in these solutions, the metric on every spacetime slice parallel to the brane
is the same as the metric on the brane, just rescaled by the ads conformal factor. thus, the
gravitational eld extends all the way to the ads horizon, at innite distance from the brane.
in the schwarzschild case, the ve dimensional solution is a black string hidden behind a
cylindrical horizon extending to innity. as shown by chamblin et al. [6] tidal forces felt
by freely falling observers actually become innite as the ads horizon is approached, which
is not very satisfactory from the physical point of view. however, it was argued that since
the innite cylindrical horizon is unstable, the nal state of collapse would perhaps have a
horizon in the shape of a cigar (rather than a full innite cilinder).

although some intuition can be drawn from the previous examples, it would be interesting
to nd physical solutions where the gravitational eld stays localized near the sources. for
this purpose, an analysis of the weak gravitational eld created by isolated matter sources
on the brane seems to be the best starting point. let us begin with the case of a single
membrane of positive tension embedded in ve dimensional ads space. the metric is given
by:

ds2 = gabdxadxb = dy2 + a2(y)dxdx.

(1)

here, a(y) = e|y|/, where  is the curvature radius of ads, and  is the minkowski metric
in four dimensions. the cosmological constant on the bulk is given by  = 62 and the
wall tension is given by  = 3/4g5, where g5 is newtons constant in ve dimensions.

denoting the perturbed metric by gab = gab + hab, the randall-sundrum (rs) gauge is

dened by

h55 = h5 = 0,



h

gauge.

it is possible to show that these conditions can be chosen everywhere in the bulk [7]. in this
gauge, the equations of motion take the simple form

ha22(4) + 2

y  42i h = 0.

(3)

the advantage of this gauge is that all components of the metric are decoupled. however,
in general, when we choose the gauge (2) in the bulk, the brane will not be located at y = 0.
instead, as we shall see, its location will be given by y = 5(x) (see g. 1), where 5 is
the solution of the equation

2(4) 5 =


6

t.

(4)

here t = t 
, and  = 8g5. in our denition of t we are not including the contribution
from the wall itself. to proceed, it will be convenient to go momentarily to gaussian
normal coordinates, which we denote by xa. by denition, the wall is located at y = 0,
and we have h55 = h5 = 0. gaussian coordinates are also interesting for us because
h(y = 0) is the metric perturbation induced on the wall. we impose even parity under
y  y, and we shall work on the positive side in the following discussion. then, the
junction condition on the extrinsic curvature at the wall requires that y(g + h) =
(/3)[( + h) + 3t  t ], which implies,

(y + 21)h = (cid:18)t

t(cid:19) .

(y = 0+)

(5)

here  = e2|y|/ is the background spatial metric. the condition (5) can now be
expressed in the rs gauge. since h55 and h5 vanish in both gauges, the most general
transformation between them must take the form

5 = 5(x),

3

 =


2

 5(x), + (x),

(6)

where 5 and  are independent of y, and for the moment we are not assuming the condition
(4). from the gauge transformation equations

h = h   5

,  21

5 + (

the junction condition (5) becomes

(y + 21)h = ,

(y = 0+)

where we have introduced the combination

(7)

(8)

(9)

this combination, which in some sense includes the bending of the wall 5, will play the
role of the source term in the rs gauge.

our solutions must be even under parity, and so from (8) the derivative of the metric
perturbation will be discontinuous at the wall. combining (8) with (3), the equations of
motion in the rs gauge become

ha22(4) + 2

y  42 + 41(y)i h = 2(y),

(10)

where the delta function terms will enforce the discontinuities. of course, in order to solve
(10), we must rst determine the function 5, which enters in the denition of the source
term . this function is given by (4), as we shall now explain. let us dene the 5d retarded
greens function, which satises

ha22(4) + 2

y  42 + 41(y)i gr(x, x)

= (5)(x  x).

the formal solution of (10) is then given by

h(x) = 2z d4xgr(x, x)(x),

(11)

(12)

 must vanish, we must impose
 = 0, which implies the equation of motion (4) for 5. with this choice of 5, it is easy

where integration is taken over the y = 0 surface. since h

to check that h given by eq.(12) satises the harmonic condition h



, = 0.

the behaviour of h at innity is determined by the form of gr(x, x). the greens
function can be constructed from a complete set of eigenstates in the usual way. following
[1], we have

gr(x, x) = z

where the rst term corresponds to the zero mode and the rest corresponds to the continuum

for the stationary case, it is more illustrative to consider the greens function for the
laplacian operator, which is related to the previous one through

g(x, y, x, y) = z 



dtgr(x, x).

(14)

here x are spatial cartesian coordinates on the wall. when both points are taken on the
wall (y = y = 0), we have

g(x, 0, x, 0)

2r2 + ...# ,

(15)

where r = |x  x|. also, when one of the points is on the wall, the leading behaviour for
large separations in any direction is given by

g(x, y, x, 0)  

a3

2a2r2 + 32
(a2r2 + 2)3/2 ,

(16)

this means that the metric perturbation decays rather steeply towards the ads horizon at
y  , i.e. a  0 (in fact even the relative metric perturbation h/a2 falls to zero as we
move away from the source). this behaviour is illustrated in fig. 1.

since we are interested in the metric on the wall, it is convenient to transform back to
5  (,),
gaussian coordinates. from (7), we have h = h(m)
where we decomposed h into the part corresponding to the matter elds and the part
corresponding to the wall displacement,

h(m)

 = 2z d4xgr(x, x)(cid:18)t 
h() = 4z d4xgr(x, x) 5(x).

(17)

(18)

setting y = 0 and choosing  appropriately, we end up with the rather simple expression

h = h(m)

 + 21 5,

(19)

which gives the metric perturbation on the wall.

i) spherical symmetry:

as a simple application, let us now consider the eect of the kk modes on the metric.
we shall restrict attention to the most interesting case of a static and spherically symmetric
source, as this may be related to to the nal stage of gravitational collapse. with our
assumptions, the energy momentum tensor can be written as

from (18) with the aid of (4), we obtain

t = (r)uu.

h() =

where v = (/2)r g(x, x)(x)d3x. then, from (12), we have

h00 = 

v (r),

hrr = 

drr2v (r).

(21)

the remaining metric components can be found from the requirement that h = 0 plus
spherical symmetry. notice that the fall-o properties of the metric components at y  
are the same as those for the greens function (16). hence the eld decays quite steeply
away from the wall. it can be checked that the perturbation of the square of the riemann
tensor behaves as

 (rr)  a2,

at large y (uniformly for all values of r.) for comparison, the same quantity behaves as
m 2a2(ar)6 in the case of the schwarzschild black string [6].

in order to nd the metric on the brane, we transform to gaussian normal coordinates.

when the point is outside the source, we have

v  

m

8r  1 +

2r2! ,

5 

m
24r

where m = r d3x is the total mass. using (19), we arrive at the result

h00 =

2gm

r  1 +

22

3r2! , hij =

2gm

r  1 +

2

3r2! ij.

(22)

(23)

it should also be stressed that the newtonian potential h00/2, which determines the attrac-
tion of neighbouring bodies, is not the same as v - which is just proportional to the greens
function g(x, 0). the coecient in front of the correction 2/r2, due to the kk modes, is
dierent in both cases, because 5 is in some sense four dimensional and contributes only to
the zero mode.

our solution diers from the weak eld limit of the usual 4 dimensional schwarzschild
solution. this seems to indicate that gravitational collapse of matter on the wall will not
lead to a schwarzschild black hole, but to a metric which has the asymptotic form of the
weak eld solution (23) [8].

ii) zero mode truncation:

in general, in order to obtain the metric perturbation induced on the brane, we must
rst solve eq. (4) for 5, feed the solution into eq. (10) for h, and then use the gauge
transformation (7) to obtain h. the expectation is that this should reproduce the results
of linearized einstein gravity with some small corrections. let us now show that, indeed, in
the case of a single brane the zero mode truncation of the ve dimensional theory coincides
with the usual linearized four dimensional gravity.

if both arguments of the two-point function are on the wall, then gr(x, x) is dominated
by the zero mode contribution, gr(x, x)  (4)(x  x)/ 2(4). substituting in (17), we
nd that the induced metric on the wall is given by

6

h = 16g

2(4) (cid:18)t 

1
2

t(cid:19) ,

(24)

where g = 1g5 is the four dimensional newtons constant. thus, we recover the linearized
einsteins equations.

it should be noted, however, that a happy cancellation has occurred: the factor 1/3
in eq.(17) has turned into the familiar 1/2 in the process of going to gaussian normal
coordinates (that is, absorbing 5) through eq. (19). as we shall see, this cancellation does
not occur in the case when we have two branes, which leads of course to some interesting
consequences.

iii) two branes and light deection:

in the case when we have two branes, one with positive tension at y = 0 and a second
one at y = d with negative tension, the previous arguments can be repeated without any
basic formal alterations. the only dierences are that the normalization of the zero mode
changes by a factor of (1  e2d/) and, more important, the eect of the goldstone mode
5 does not cancel out. following the steps of the derivation given above, we nd that in
the zero mode approximation the gravitational eld on each of the branes satises [9]

(25)

where the plus and minus refer to quantities on the wall with positive and with negative
tension respectively. here, we have introduced

g() =

g51ed/
2 sinh(d/l)

(26)

which plays the role of newtons constant in a brans-dicke (bd) parametrization (we follow
the conventions of ref. [10]).

strictly speaking, this parametrization holds when the other wall (the one in which
we do not live) is empty. let us rst consider this situation. in this case, the bd parameter
is given by

()
bd =

3
2

(e2d/l  1).

(27)

observations require that bd > 3000 [10]. in the positive tension brane, this is achieved
with d/l > 4, and we have an acceptable gravity theory even without stabilizing the dilaton.
in the negative tension brane, we nd that the bd parameter is always negative but greater
than -3/2. in the einstein frame, the kinetic term for the bd eld has the usual sign for
bd > 3/2. this suggests that the system of two branes is well behaved in spite of the
negative tension in one of the branes.

now, let us consider the eect of shadow matter, which lives on the other membrane.
this appears only in the rst term in (25). hence, for non-relativistic matter, and assuming
spherical symmetry, its contribution to the newtonian potential h00 will be twice as large

7

as its contribution to any of the diagonal spatial components, say hzz. this is in contrast
with the situation in einsteins theory, where the contribution to the newtonian potential is
the same as the contribution to hzz. for a source in the x, y plane, the deection of a light
ray travelling in the y direction is given by x = (1/2)(h00 + hyy),x. therefore, for the same
newtonian mass the deection of light rays caused by shadow matter is 25% smaller that in
einstein gravity. it would be interesting to investigate this possible eect in an astrophysical
context. this is left for future research.
