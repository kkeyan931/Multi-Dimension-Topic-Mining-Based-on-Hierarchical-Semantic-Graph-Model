in [hep-th/9907222] hannibal claims to exclude the existence of particle-like static axially sym-
metric non-abelian solutions in su (2) einstein-yang-mills-dilaton theory. his argument is based
on the asymptotic behaviour of such solutions. here we disprove his claim by giving explicitly the
asymptotic form of non-abelian solutions with winding number n = 2.

particle-like static axially symmetric solutions of yang-mills-dilaton (ymd) [1] and einstein-yang-mills-dilaton
(eymd) theory [2,3] have been investigated numerically and analytically [4] in recent years. the gauge potential, given
in a singular gauge in [13], can locally be gauge transformed into a regular form [4]. on intersecting neighbourhoods
the regular gauge potentials can be gauge transformed into each other by regular gauge transformations. hence these
solutions are globally regular.

recently, hannibal [7] claimed to have shown that the static axially symmetric solutions discussed in [13,5,6,4] are
singular in the gauge eld part. however, in [7] he only observed that the gauge potential of refs. [13,5,6] does not
obey a set of sucient regularity conditions [8]. repeating his claim in [9], and noting that the singular solutions
can be locally gauge transformed into regular solutions as discussed in [4,10], hannibal apparently uses the equality
solution = gauge potential, despite the fact that the gauge potential is not uniquely dened and the same solution
can be given in many dierent gauges.

in [9] hannibal then turns to the question of existence of static axially symmetric solutions of ymd and eymd
theory. he presents as his results, that i) there exist only embedded abelian particle-like solutions and ii) the
solutions constructed by kleihaus and kunz are shown to be gauge equivalent to these.

particle-like solutions of eymd and related theories  which are not embedded abelian solutions  have been
investigated in the past decade by several authors (see e. g. [11]) and it is generally accepted that these solutions are
genuine non-abelian solutions. for rigorous proofs of the existence of these solutions see e. g. [12].

concerning the static axially symmetric solutions, the argument of hannibal relies on the fact that he was not able

to nd asymptotic solutions, which possess the correct symmetries with respect to the discrete transformation

s(zz) :      .

(1)

however, he chooses a gauge in which this symmetry is lost for all non-trivial gauge eld functions parameterizing the
gauge potential. apparently he takes this into account for one of the functions, but does not take it into consideration
for the other two functions. without taking into account the correct symmetry behaviour of the gauge eld functions
the results are not reliable.

by giving a counterexample, we here disprove hannibals claim, that there exist only embedded abelian particle-
like solutions ... [9], because asymptotic solutions for genuine non-abelian gauge potentials do not exist. this
counterexample represents the correct asymptotic behaviour for a non-abelian static axially symmetric solution of
eymd theory [2,3,5,6].

using polar coordinates (r, , ), we parameterize the static axially symmetric su(2) gauge potential as [5]

where hi are functions of r and  and n denotes the winding number. for convenience we set the gauge coupling
constant g equal to one in the following. the su(2) matrices  n
 are dened in terms of pauli matrices 1, 2, 3
by

r = sin  n

 + cos 3 ,  n

 = cos  n

  sin 3 ,

with  n

 = cos(n)1 + sin(n)2.

in order to compare with ref. [9] we parameterize the functions hi as [7]

h1 = h f1 sin2  +(cid:16)nf (r) + f2(cid:17)i cos  sin|n|  ,

(1  h2) = hnf (r) + f1 sin2  cos2  (cid:16)nf (r) + f2(cid:17) sin2 i sin|n|1  ,

h3 = h(cid:16)f (r) + f3 sin2 (cid:17) cos  sin|n|1 i sin  + f4 sin  cos 

= f3 sin  + f4 cos  ,

(1  h4) = h(cid:16)f (r) + f3 sin2 (cid:17) cos  sin|n|1 i cos   f4 sin2 

= f3 cos   f4 sin  ,

where fi are continuous functions of r and  and f3 = (f (r) + f3 sin2 ) cos  sin|n|1 , f4 = f4 sin  have been
introduced for later convenience. assuming that fi are regular functions of r2 and sin2  [8], this parameterization of
the ansatz guarantees that the gauge potential is regular on the z-axis (|z| > 0) and that the functions h1 and h3
are odd under the transformation s(zz) :     , whereas the functions h2 and h4 are even [7]. in order to
guarantee regularity at the origin, additional conditions have to be imposed on the functions fi.
the gauge potential (2) is form invariant under abelian gauge transformations of the form [4]

where  is a function of r and . the functions hi transform like

u = exp(cid:8)i n

 /2(cid:9) ,

h1  h1 = h1  rr ,
h2  h2 = h2 +  ,
h3  h3 = cos (h3 + cot )  sin h4  cot  ,
h4  h4 = sin (h3 + cot ) + cos h4 .

(10)

(11)
(12)

(13)
(14)

following [9], we now x the gauge such that h2 = 1 and assume that h2 is given in the form (5). the gauge
transformation function is given by

(r, ) = z 

0

{1  h2(r, )} d .

(15)

again following [9], we choose 0 = 0, in order to maintain regularity on the positive z-axis (z > 0). then the gauge
potential may diverge on the negative z-axis [9]. along the (positive) z-axis the function h1 is still of the order
o(sin|n| ) and may be written locally as h1 = f1 cos  sin|n| , with some function f1(r, ). the gauge transformed
function f3 is now of order o(sin|n|+1 ) and may be written as f3 = f3 cos  sin|n|+1  near the (positive) z-axes,
with some function f3(r, ). hence, we nd near the (positive) z-axis

h1 = f1 cos  sin|n|  ,

(1  h2) = 0 ,

h3 = h f3 sin|n|+1  + f4i sin  cos  ,
(1  h4) = f3 cos2  sin|n|+1   f4 sin2  .

(16)

(19)

this form of the gauge eld functions hi could have been obtained from eqs. (4)-(8) by setting f (r)  0 and
f2 = cos2  f1 [9]. however, under the assumption that the functions fi are continuous everywhere, this would not
have been correct. this can be seen as follows.

the function  contains an even part and an odd part with respect to the transformation s(zz) [9]. as a
consequence the function h1 is no longer odd with respect to s(zz) [9] and cannot be written in the form (16)
with continuous functions fi. it is evident from eqs. (13)-(14) that the functions h3 and h4 also have lost their

2

antisymmetry, respectively symmetry, with respect to s(zz). thus all the functions hi may take nite values on
the -axis. if we then insist to use the parameterization eqs. (16-19) for the gauge transformed functions hi, not
only near the (positive) z-axis but everywhere, we must allow the functions f1 and f3 to contain the factor 1/ cos .

parameterizing the metric [2,3,5,6,9] by

ds2 = g(r, )dt2 +

m(r, )
g(r, )

(dr2 + r2d2) +

l(r, )
g(r, )

(20)

we substitute the gauge transformed ansatz eq. (2) together with (16)-(19) and (20) into the coupled einstein, dilaton
and yang-mills equations and nd for the asymptotic eymd solution with winding number n = 2,

for the dilaton function [13] and the metric functions, where c1, c2, 1, g1, l2, m2 are constants [14]. the (. . .)
indicate terms vanishing faster than 1/r2, which can not necessarily be expanded in powers of 1/r. it is easy to see
that f1 and f3 are nite on the positive z-axis and can be expressed as polynomials in sin2  in the vicinity of the
z-axis. hence, the asymptotic solution is regular on the positive z-axis. on the -axis the gauge eld functions hi
are nite, as expected. furthermore, h1 can be decomposed into an odd part and an even part with respect s(zz),

2k h1
where the latter is a function of r only [9]. as a consequence all derivatives
2k vanish on the -axis. on the z-axis
the functions f10(r) := f1(r,  = 0) and f40(r) := f4(r,  = 0) are not necessarily zero. hence, this solution is not
an embedded abelian solution and has to be classied as type iii according to ref. [9]. for winding number n = 3, 4
we have constructed asymptotic solutions, too, which possess all the correct symmetry and regularity properties.
these simple solutions disprove the claim of hannibal [9] that only for embedded abelian gauge potentials asymptotic
solutions with the correct symmetries can exist in eymd and related theories.

we have also analysed the solution with winding number n = 2 in the coulomb gauge rh1,r  h2, = 0 [15], which
was employed in the numerical construction of the solutions [13,5,6]. in this gauge the gauge potential is not well
dened on the z-axis. however, transforming the asymptotic solution obtained in the coulomb gauge into the gauge
h2 = 1, we nd the same form eqs. (21-23). this shows that at innity the gauge potential in the coulomb gauge can
be locally gauge transformed into a regular gauge potential and that the asymptotic gauge potentials in the dierent
gauges correspond to the same asymptotic solution. note, that in the coulomb gauge the functions h1 and h3 are
antisymmetric, whereas the functions h2 and h4 are symmetric with respect to s(zz).

in ref. [9] hannibal failed to obtain asymptotic non-abelian solutions such as the solution eqs. (21)-(24). clearly,
he rejected solutions because the functions hi did not possess the symmetry property he erroneously expected.
furthermore, he tried to nd the solutions in form of power series in sin . however, the solution eqs. (21)-(22)
contains the function 1/ cos , which, considered as a power series in sin , has radius of convergence | sin | < 1. thus,
the results at  = /2 may be not reliable. unfortunately, the presentation in [9] is not consistent at various places,
and it remains unclear which calculations exactly were carried out and whether additional sources of error appeared
in the analysis.

we close with some additional comments on ref. [9]:
it is assumed in [9] that the asymptotic solutions can be obtained as a power series in 1/r. however, if one wants to
exclude the existence of all solutions (except embedded abelian solutions), then a proof that all solutions are analytic
in the variable 1/r at 1/r = 0 would be necessary. such a proof is not given in ref. [9]. indeed, we nd that in the
coulomb gauge terms in higher order arise, which can not be expanded in a power series in 1/r [15].

it is claimed in [9] that there exists a regular, globally dened gauge potential for the solutions of ref. [13,5,6].
however, the proof of existence of such a gauge potential is not complete, because no attention is paid to the
regularity of the gauge potential at the origin [4].
it can be seen easily, that the gauge potential is not twice
dierentiable at the origin, if high powers in sin  arise, which are not multiplied by suciently high powers in r.

in [9] the static axially symmetric solutions of ref. [13,5,6] are classied as gauge equivalent to type ii solutions.
this is not correct. dening type ii solutions by f10(r) = h1, = 0 on the z-axis (for n = 2) [9], hannibal then
argues, that f10(r) species a boundary condition, which can be chosen freely, and that therefore a non-zero h1, on
the z-axis can not be generated. however, only for a local solution can the function f10(r) be chosen freely, i. e. for
any function f10(r) there exists a solution of the dierential equations which is valid only in a region near the z-axis.
for a global solution the function f10(r) has to be chosen such that the solution fullls the correct boundary condition
at the -axis. if the global solution is unique, the function f10(r) is xed (provided the gauge is xed).
