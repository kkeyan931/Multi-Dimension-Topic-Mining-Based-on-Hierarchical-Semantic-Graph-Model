(2) addition this, supplementary equation coming identity satised abelian gauge eld strength tensor, f + f + f = 0. bianchi 4 identity geometrical equation terms hodge dual eld strength, f = 1 2f, written f = 0 (3) seems noteworthy eld equation eq.(2) dynamical eld equation gets determined concrete nature gauge theory action one eq.(1). bianchi identity eq.(3), hand, simply geometrical identity completely independent choice context gauge theory. set four equations, known maxwell equations classical electrodynamics, however, may viewed somewhat incomplete right hand side (r.h.s) bianchi identity vacant. thus dirac proposes make look complete adding magnetic current density term k = (m, ji m) r.h.s. further, one decomposes covariant equations using = (/t, i), = = (/t, i) (namely, use sign convention, = diag(1, 1, 1, 1)), = (, ai) eld identication, ei = fi0, bi = 1 2 ijkf jk fij = ijkbk, dynamical eld equation decomposes ~e = e, ~b ~e = ~je geometrical bianchi identity decomposes ~b = m, ~e + ~b = ~jm. (4) (5) maxwell equations invariant duality transformation (here work, restrict discrete duality transformation, continuous duality rotations ) f f ( ~e ~b), j k (6) f f ( ~b ~e), k j. note, however, dual invariance symmetry classical eld equa- tion bianchi identity maxwell theory action l = 1 4 ff 5 f f = ff . lastly, end review magnetic monopoles maxwell gauge theory, recall, later use, expressions static electric mag- netic elds generated electric magnetic monopoles sitting origin hence solutions ~e = e3(~r) ~b = g3(~r) given respectively ~e = (e/4r2)r ~b = (g/4r2)r r 6= 0. structure, i.e., identical r-dependences expected dual symmetry maxwell equations. point, familiar hence looks trivial, contrasted happens study static monopole elds abelian bi gauge theory turn. iii. monopole dyon elds abelian bi gauge theory usual, begin action abelian bi theory given, 4-dimensions,  = z d4x(2"1 sdet( + = z d4x(2"1 s1 + 1 f)# + ja) (7) 1 22 ff 1 164 (f f )2# + ja) generic parameter theory dimension dim = dim = +2. probes degree deviation bi gauge theory standard maxwell theory obviously limit corresponds standard maxwell theory. again, extremzing action respect yields dynamical bi eld equation q1 + 1 42 (f f ) f f 1 22 ff 1 164 (f f )2 = j. (8) geometrical bianchi identity, supplementary equation eld equation is, mentioned earlier, independent nature gauge theory action. thus before, split covariant equations write terms ~e ~b f = 0. (9) elds get r " 1 " 1 r ( ~e + ( ~b 1 2 ( ~e ~b) ~b)# = e, 2 ( ~e ~b) ~e)# 1 " 1 r (10) ( ~e + 1 2 ( ~e ~b) ~b)# = ~je 6 r q1 + 1 dynamical bi eld equation 22 ff 1 164 (f f )2 = r1 1 2 ( ~e2 ~b2) 1 4 ( ~e ~b)2 ~b = 0, ~e + ~b = 0 (11) geometrical bianchi identity used ff = 2( ~e2 ~b2) f f = 4 ~e ~b. consider case electric current density j = (e,~je) magnetic current density k = (m,~jm) present. before, bianchi identity gets modied ~b = m, ~e + ~b = ~jm (12) or, covariant form, f = k. one readily realize that, unlike maxwell equations, four bi equations evidently possess duality invariance mentioned earlier. namely, two dynamical bi eld equations remaining two geometrical bianchi identity dual attributed fact passing standard maxwell highly nonlinear bi theory, dynamical eld equations experience non-trivial change (nonlinearization) geometrical bianchi identity remains unchanged independent nature gauge theory itself. inherent lack dual invariance bi equations may imply need introduce point-like magnetic monopole current rst place. sake parallel study interesting monopole physics maxwell theory, shall assume existence point-like magnetic monopole explore physics structure static monopole elds possible existence dyon solution. first, consider static magnetic monopole eld electric monopole eld abelian bi gauge theory. static magnetic monopole eld obtained solving one bianchi identity equations, ~b = g3(~r). ~r 6= 0, spherical-polar coordinates, equation given /r2 sin = 0 solved br(r) = g/4r2, b = b = 0. note solution form holds irrespective existence electric monopole. next, static electric monopole eld 7 obtained one dynamical eld equations  = e3(~r) r n1 ( ~e2 ~b2)/2 ( ~e ~b)2/4o1/2 coordinates, equation becomes /r2 sin = 0 . ~r 6= 0, spherical-polar ei /r. firstly, absence magnetic monopole, ei = ei/q1 ~e2/2 equation solved er(r) = e/4qr4 + (e/4)2, e = e = 0. next, presence magnetic monopole, one put magnetic monopole eld ~b = (g/4r2)r ei r solve equation. equation admits solution er(r) = e/4qr4 + (e2 + g2)/(4)2,e = e = 0. static magnetic monopole eld abelian bi theory, therefore, turns identical standard maxwell theory. concerning static electric monopole eld abelian bi theory, however, two peculiar features worthy note. one thing, unlike maxwell theory, electric monopole eld magnetic monopole eld exhibit dierent r-dependences attributed fact bi theory, dynamical eld equation bianchi identity dual other. besides, since static electric monopole eld singular r 0, energy stored eld electric point charge could nite point seems consistent consideration niteness energy, one motivations propose bi electrodynamics rst devised. other, interesting note static electric monopole eld gets modied magnetic monopole (eld) present although r-dependence remains essentially observed above. indeed peculiar feature unique analogue standard maxwell theory. magnetic monopole (eld) present, strength static electric monopole eld appears experience attenuation particularly noticeable small-r region, compared case without magnetic monopole eld. also tempting interpret unique coupling electric magnetic eld even static monopole case (which evidently originates highly nonlinear nature bi theory action 4-dimensions) manifestation existence dyon even abelian 8 bi gauge theory. thus elaborate particularly interesting point. first notice evaluation det( + f/) general form bi action particularly 4-dimensions produces term (f f )2/164 = ( ~e ~b)2/4, i.e., sdet( + 1 f) = s1 + 1 22 ff 1 164 (f f )2. precisely term induces unique direct coupling electric magnetic eld even static monopole case hence generates dyon solution. next, seem left question : evidences would support dyon interpretation monopole solutions ? ~b = g 4r2 r, ~e = e 4rr4 + e2+g2 (4)2 r. (13) even loose sense, two pieces evidences suggested. begin rst one. consider standard maxwell theory, monopole solutions ~b = {g/4|~r ~rb|3} (~r ~rb) ~e = {e/4|~r ~re|3} (~r ~re), corresponding congura- tion magnetic charge g xed ~r = ~rb electric charge xed ~r = ~re separately, simultaneous solutions maxwell equations. particular solu- tions ~b = {g/4r2} r ~e = {e/4r2} r represent case two monopoles g e happen sitting location, origin. bi theory electro- magnetism, however, particular solutions given eq.(13) simply represent case two monopole, g e sitting separately origin. instead, particular static monopole solutions represent single, point-like entity carrying elec- tric magnetic charges, i.e., point-like dyon. see indeed case, notice ~b = {g/4|~r ~rb|2} (r rb) ~e = ne/4q|~r ~re|4 + o (r re) (where (r rb) (~r ~rb)/|~r ~rb|) fail simultaneous solutions bi equa- tions ~b = g3(~r ~rb)  = e3(~r ~re) (where r n1 ( ~e2 ~b2)/2 ( ~e ~b)2/4o1/2 ) ~rb 6= ~re. they, however, simultane- ous solutions ~rb = ~re, namely g e stick other. straightforward check static monopole solutions bi equations ~rb 6= ~re, 9 actually worked out, turn take dierent structures given simply replacing ~r (~r ~rb) ~r (~r ~re). certainly sharp contrast happens standard maxwell electromagnetism ~b = {g/4|~r ~rb|2} (r rb) ~e = {e/4|~r ~re|2} (r re), obtained simply replacing ~r (~r ~rb) ~r (~r ~re) legitimate unique solutions maxwell equations even ~rb 6= ~re. undoubtedly, observation implies bi theory, electric magnetic charges present, stick together form point-like dyon static electric magnetic elds produces given expressions given ~rb = ~re. thus thought one clear evidence favor dyon interpretation derived terms energetics (argument terms energy) follows. consider energy-momentum tensor bi theory = 2(1 r) + 1 r "ff # 1 42 (ff )f f (14) r given earlier. energy density stored electromagnetic eld read t00 = 2 1 + 1 2 ~b2 r1 1 2 ( ~e2 ~b2) 1 4 ( ~e ~b)2 1 (15) reduce maxwell theorys counterpart ( ~e2 + ~b2)/2 limit should. compute energy density solely due magnetic eld generated magnetic charge g. using ~b = (g/4r2)r, b 00 = 2"s1 + 1 2 ~b2 1# = 2 vuut1 + g2 (4)2 1 r4 1 . (16) next, calculate energy density stored electric eld generated electric charge e. using ~e = ne/4qr4 + (e/4)2o r, one gets e 00 = 2 1 r1 1 2 ~e2 1 = 2 vuut1 + e2 (4)2 1 r4 1 . (17) 10 seem two points worthy note. one fact b 00 e 00 basically except g e interchanged although magnetic monopole eld ~b electric monopole eld ~e possess dierent r-dependences. is, born infeld hoped constructed new theory, energy stored static monopole eld indeed nite. instance, electric monopole energy evaluated concrete manner  00 = z 0 dr2"s(4r2)2 + e2 2 4r2# e = z d3xt e = e3 4 z = e3 0 3/2 3( 3 4 dy(cid:20)qy4 + 1 y2(cid:21) 4)2 = 1.23604978se3 4 (18) y2 = (4/e2)r2 y-integral, integration part elliptic integral used. coming back argument based energetics, lastly compute energy density due electric magnetic elds generated electric charge magnetic charge. substituting expressions given eq.(13) eq.(15), one gets e+b 00 = 2 s1 1 (4)2 1 + g2 (4)2 1 r4 1 (4)2o he2 g2n1 + g2 nr4+ e2+g2 (4)2 . 1 1 r4oi (19) note following two points : concerning dyon interpretation, would like draw hints comparing e+b 00 e 00 + b 00. firstly, e+b 00 turns symmetric e g whereas e 00 + b 00 noticed earlier. secondly, sum energy density magnetic monopole eld alone b 00 energy density electric monopole eld alone e 00 equal energy density electric magnetic elds electric magnetic monopoles present, i.e., e 00 + b 00 6= e+b 00 . observations apparent contrast happens standard maxwell theory e 00 + b 00 = 1 2( ~e2 + ~b2) = e2+g2 2(4)2 ( 1 r4 ) = e+b 00 hence possibility e g bound state dyon completely excluded even forced brought together. here, 11 considering total energy e g system, one might wonder e g interaction potential energy taken account. recall, however, considering static case e g held xed position hence exert force other. see this, note lorentz force law generalized presence electric magnetic charges (the validity lorentz force law even context bi electrodynamics discussed carefully later on) components, d2x 2 = (cid:16)ef + g f (cid:17) dx ~f = e( ~e + ~v ~b) + g( ~b ~v ~e) (20) one realize that, unlike homogeneous systems electric charges alone magnetic charges alone, interaction force (and hence potential energy) e g arises one two motion relative other. therefore static case, interaction force potential energy static e g thus total energy density e g system given simply e+b 00 . therefore consideration energetics e g system also appears provide another concrete evidence favor existence e g bound state, i.e., dyon bi theory electromagnetism although denite statement made one could somehow show e+b 00 which, 00 < e 00 + b least us, look easy demonstrate straightforward manner. lastly, one realize despite unique interesting features, static monopole elds non-trivial bi theory (i.e., nite-) eectively indistinguishable standard maxwell theory far (r ) zone possibly signicant deviations occur near (r 0) zone. close study monopoles dyons abelian bi gauge theory, would like make one point seems worthy note. standard maxwell theory, motion electrically charged particle radial magnetic monopole eld interest. thus consider motion electrically charged test particle 12 external background magnetic eld generated static magnetic monopole acting source. (thus situation distinguished system static electric charge e magnetic charge g considered e g xed position thus treated sources static monopole elds.) little specic, well-known system conserved quantity orbital angular momentum charged test particle, ~l, total angular momentum given ~j = ~l eg 4 r (21) ~jem = r d3x = (eg/4)r angular momentum charged point particles electric eld obeying ~e = e3(~x ~r) (with ~r trajectory electric charge) static monopoles magnetic eld ~b = (g/4r2)x. quantized version theory, then, one expects components ~j satisfy usual angular momentum commutation relations implying eigenvalues ji half integers. since orbital angular momentum ~l expected integral eigenvalues, one gets eg/4 = n/2 n integers. thus eq.(21), turn, implies dirac quantization condition eg = 2n. (22) one might wonder would happen test electric charge-source monopole system particularly concerning dirac quantization rule context abelian bi theory. answer is, interestingly, essential changes occur. see this, rst attempt derive expression conserved total angular momentum system. so, however, one needs know bi theory version lorentz force law. mentioned earlier, indeed lorentz force law determined gauge theory-independent manner. readily checked follows. begin 4-vector current charged particle localized spacetime trajectory x( ) particles proper time j(t, ~y) = e dx dt 3|t=x0( ) = ez dx 4 13 fullls continuity equation j = 0. see lorentz force law would look like context bi electrodynamics, consider combined system charged test particle given background gauge eld abelian bi theory described action = z d4x  mz ds = z d4xlbi + ez dxa mz ds = z d4xlbi +z dt(cid:20)mq1 v2 ea0 + eaivi(cid:21) (23) lbi abelian bi theory action given earlier used ds = = dtq1 v2 apparently, charged particle acts additional source thus modifying surrounding . eld. if, however, neglect back reaction eect rst approximation assume external background eld, may leave gauge eld action external eld serves hard background. thus usual approximation back reaction charged test particle surrounding eld neglected, motion charged particle becomes independent detailed dynamical nature gauge theory itself. therefore motion charged particle inuence given external gauge eld would governed action = z dt(cid:20)mq1 v2 + e(aivi a0)(cid:21) extremizing respect xi, one gets following euler-lagranges equation motion ~p /dt = e( ~e + ~v ~b) p = mvi/q1 v2 . since usual lorentz force law, realize indeed holds irrespective context dynamical gauge theory stated above. thus even abelian bi gauge theory, rate change orbital angular momentum system consisting electrically charged test particle source magnetic monopole d~l dt = ~r ~p dt = eg 4r3 ~r ( ~r ~r) = dt (cid:18) eg 4 r(cid:19) suggesting conserved total angular momentum given ~j = ~l (eg/4)r standard maxwell theory. result implies usual dirac quanti- 14 zation condition still holds true abelian bi theory well. addition, also realized work bi theory, point-like dyons well magnetic monopoles exist. hard see even combined system electrically charged test particle static source dyon, conserved total angular momentum test particle-monopole system hence dirac quantization condition also remains same. next, seems worthy note interpretation total angular mo- mentum sum orbital angular momentum ~l test electric charge e eld angular momentum ~jem = (eg/4)r due electric charge e magnetic charge g also stays maxwell theory case. namely, angular momentum passed back forth electric charge eld expected be. statement sounds natural hence taken granted. demonstrate indeed case even context bi theory trivial hence seems worth doing. thus following, briey sketch demonstration. so, need preparation. dynamical bi eld equations given earlier, dene, sake convenience formulation, electric displacement ~d magnetic eld ~h terms fundamental elds ~e ~b ~d = 1 r ( ~e + 1 2 ( ~e ~b) ~b) , ~h = 1 r ( ~b 1 2 ( ~e ~b) ~e) r = r1 1 2 ( ~e2 ~b2) 1 4 ( ~e ~b)2 dened earlier. bi equations take form ~d = e, ~h ~b = m, ~e + ~d ~b = ~je = ~jm. (24) ~e (amperes law eq.) ~h (faradays induction law eq.) yields ~h ( ~e) ~e ( ~h) = ~h ~b ~e ~d ~je ~e ~jm ~h. using 15 ~h ( ~e) ~e ( ~h) = ( ~e ~h), ~h ~b ~e ~d = t00 t00 energy density stored electromagnetic eld bi theory given eq.(15), one arrives familiar local energy conservation equation ~s + u = ~je ~e ~jm ~h (25) u = t00 energy density, ~s = ~e ~h poynting vector representing local energy ow per unit time per unit area ~je ~e ~jm ~h right hand side power dissipation per unit volume. particular ~je ~e = 0 = ~jm ~h, one gets ~s + u = 0 precisely equation continuity electromagnetic energy density. derived bi theory version poynting vector ~s = ~e ~h = ~e ( ~b/r), angular momentum electromagnetic eld obtained integrating moment poynting vector space yields ~jem = z d3x(cid:20)~x ( ~e 1 r ~b)(cid:21) 1 r = z d3x(cid:20)~x ( = z d3x( ~d)(cid:20) g 4 ~e ~b)(cid:21) = z d3xh~x ( ~d ~b)i x(cid:21) = eg 4 r (26) used ~b = (g/4r2)x ~d = e3(~x~r) representing conguration static source magnetic monopole sitting origin test electric charge, point time, ~r. thus completes demonstration. iv. concluding remarks summarise, interesting note context bi electrodynamics, despite inherent lack dual symmetry bi equations, assume existence magnetic monopoles, interesting new physics emerge exotic behavior static electric monopole eld existence point-like dyons cherished principles dirac quantisation condition still hold true without experiencing modication. 16 concerning nature present work, word caution may helpful answer possible criticism. is, one might wonder exactly distinguishes present work pile works similar subjects recent literature . mentioned beginning introduction, revival interest bi gauge theory triggered recently fashionable d-brane physics . indeed recent literature, one nds number works discussing dyons abelian bi gauge theory . use terminology, bions soliton solutions possessing properties dyons. although dyon solutions also static solutions abelian bi gauge theory, arise theories resulted dimensional reduction higher-dimensional (10-dimensional, specic) supersymmetric pure abelian bi theory. theories emerge result dimensional reduction, inevitably involve one scalar elds degrees freedom representing compactied extra dimensions addition 4-dimensional abelian bi gauge eld. precisely additional scalar elds play role higgs-type eld familiar yang-mills-higgs theory  thus lead bogomolnyi-type rst-order equations  solitonic solutions generally dyon solutions. thus dyon solutions brane-inspired theories really julia- zee-type dyon solutions  nature abelian bi gauge eld involved behaves abelian projection non-abelian yang-mills eld spontaneous symmetry breaking. dyon solutions rely, existence, entirely non-vanishing scalar elds particular solution behavior. addition, electric charge magnetic charge two independent parameters. instead, generated single parameter theory. besides, seems worth mentioning even early works  (but modern perspective) 4-dimensional nonlinear electrodynamics, bi, never considered physics presence magnetic monopoles discussed exotic behavior static electric monopole eld. contrast, philosophy present work parallel comparison monopole physics standard maxwell electrodynamics original version abelian bi electrodynamics connection whatsoever brane physics. thus relevant degree freedom 17 theory abelian gauge eld alone discovered static solutions possessing evidences favor dyon interpretation. moreover, point-like dyon solution carries electric magnetic charges independent dirac quantisation condition. conclude, therefore, point-like dyon solution original version 4-dimensional bi electrodynamics found present work distinguished ones name appeared recent literature. stressed text, occurrence point-like dyon solution bi electrodynamics attributed highly nonlinear nature theory, precisely, unique direct coupling electric magnetic elds appearing particularly 4-dimensions even static case. lastly, present work witnessed even simple study monopole physics exposed unique exciting hidden features abelian bi gauge theory seems suggest bi gauge theories, abelian non-abelian, really deserve serious full exploration modern eld theory perspective. acknowledgements author would like thank prof. bum-hoon lee valuable comments. work supported part grant post-doc. program kyungpook national university (1999). references  m. born, proc. r. soc. london, a143, 410 (1934) ; m. born m. infeld, proc. r. soc. london, a144, 425 (1934) ; p. a. m. dirac, proc. r. soc. london, a268, 57 (1962).  j. polchinski, tasi lectures d-branes, hep-th/9611050 ; r. argurio, brane physics m-theory, hep-th/9807171 ; k. g. savvidy, born-infeld action string theory, hep-th/9906075,
