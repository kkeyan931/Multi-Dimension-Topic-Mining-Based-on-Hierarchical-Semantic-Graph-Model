abstract

we obtain the orbifold virasoro master equation (ovme) at integer order , which
summarizes the general virasoro construction on orbifold ane algebra. the ovme
includes the virasoro master equation when  = 1 and contains large classes of stress
tensors of twisted sectors of conventional orbifolds at higher . the generic construc-
tion is like a twisted sector of an orbifold (with non-zero ground state conformal weight)
but new orbifold-like constructions are obtained for which we have found no conven-
tional orbifold interpretation.

1 introduction

the virasoro master equation (vme) summarizes the general virasoro construction1,2 on
ane lie algebra,

t (z) = lab : ja(z)jb(z) : ,

a, b = 1, ..., dimg .

(1.1)

see ref. 3 for a review of the vme and irrational conformal eld theory. subsequent de-
velopments in this subject include semiclassical examples of conformal blocks4 in irrational
conformal eld theory, unication58 with the general non-linear sigma model and the con-
struction of the stress tensors of twisted sectors of cyclic permutation orbifolds9 from copies
of the general virasoro construction (1.1).

our starting point in this paper is the orbifold ane algebra9 at integer order , which
was recently found in the twisted sectors of cyclic permutation orbifolds and includes ane
lie algebra when  = 1. following the suggestion of ref. 9, we consider here the general
virasoro construction on orbifold ane algebra

t (z) =

1
xr=0 lab

r

: j (r)

a (z) j (r)

b

(z) :,

a, b = 1, ..., dimg,

  zz+

(1.2)

a (z), r = 0, ...,   1 are the orbifold currents. when  = 1, the orbifold currents

where j (r)
a (z) = ja(z) satisfy ane lie algebra and t (z) reduces to t (z) in (1.1).
j (0)
the stress tensor t (z) is conformal when lab

r satises the orbifold virasoro master equa-
tion (ovme) at order , and the ovme contains the conformal eld theories of the vme
when  = 1. at higher , the ovme contains large classes of stress tensors of twisted
sectors of conventional permutation orbifolds, and many other constructions. the generic
construction of the ovme is like a twisted sector of an orbifold or a ramond (spin) sector
because the ground state conformal weights 0 of the constructions

l(m  0)|0i = m,0 0|0i,

0 6= 0

(1.3)

are generically non-zero. new unitary solutions of the ovme are obtained however, with
irrational central charge and/or irrational conformal weights, for which we have found no
conventional orbifold interpretation.

in our opinion, the ovme provides evidence for a large class of new orbifold-like confor-

mal eld theories.

the special case  = 1 is known as the integral ane subalgebra13,14,9, whose generators

form an ane lie algebra at levels {ki}. related subalgebras include h  g, /  zz+

the orbifold currents with (mother theory) conformal weights (a) = (b) = 1. we will
use instead the ope normal-ordering convention

where {lab
t satises the virasoro algebra

(3.3a)

(3.3b)

(3.4)

the form of the restriction (3.3), in terms of the combination f ab
r , is a consequence of the
symmetry (2.14). any solution of the system (3.3) gives a conformal stress tensor t , but
this system is problematic because it has more unknowns than equations.

3.2 equivalent solutions

the system (3.3) determines only the combination f ab
r
a gauge invariance under the gauge transformation

in (3.3b). this means that (3.3) has

using the symmetry (2.14) again, we see that the gauge transformation (3.5) is also an

invariance of the stress tensor

where 0 is the conformal weight of the ground state. this conformal weight is generically
nonzero so that the generic construction of the ovme is like a twisted sector of an orbifold
or a ramond spin sector. the ground state conformal weight may occasionally vanish, e.g.
the cfts of the vme at  = 1 have 0 = 0.

in these relations, we have used the convention that a sum is zero when its lower limit
is greater than its upper limit. the forms (3.14b) and (3.15b) of the ovme are useful for
computational purposes, while the form (3.9b) is useful for studying general properties of
the system.

4 properties of the ovme

4.1 counting

the ovme is a set of

n(g, ) = (


2 + 1)

dimg(dimg + 1)

2

(4.1)

coupled quadratic equations for the same number of unknowns (3.13).

the number of physically inequivalent solutions to the ovme expected3 at each level k

is therefore

(4.3)

(4.4a)

(4.4b)

where  = 1 is the vme and the growth with  at xed g is exponential.

it is clear that, as in the vme, most of the solutions of the ovme will be new and
(because the ovme is a large set of coupled quadratic equations) the new constructions will
have generically irrational conformal weights and central charges.

8

4.2 lab

r

independent of r

for any , we consider the simple consistent ansatz

r ( g) = lab( g),
lab

(4.5)

( g is dened in (2.3)) which collects all inverse inertia tensors independent of r. then the
ovme simplies to a rescaled vme

lab( g) = [2lac( g)gcdldb( g)  lcd( g)lef ( g)f a

where lab(g) is any solution of the vme (3.11b) on semisimple ane lie g.

(4.8)

which can be constructed from  copies of any ane-virasoro construction (3.11a). in what
follows, we will call (4.7) the set of cyclic constructions.c

because they operate in cyclic permutation orbifolds, the cyclic constructions form a

virasoro subalgebra of the orbifold virasoro algebra9

as sums of commuting copies of the cyclic constructions (4.7). this is because every element of sn can be
expressed as a product of disjoint cyclic permutations.

where the zero-twist component t (0) of the extended algebra is the cyclic construction t
in (4.7).

among the cyclic constructions, we note in particular the orbifold ane-sugawara con-

struction tg,

where qi is the quadratic casimir of gi and cg is the central charge of the ane-sugawara

simple g is:

(4.11a)

(4.11c)

here hg = qg/2 is the dual coxeter number of g, x  zz+ is the invariant level in (2.4) and
cg(x) is the central charge of the ane-sugawara construction on simple g.

the orbifold ane-sugawara constructions include the ane-sugawara constructions tg
at  = 1, and we shall see below that the orbifold ane-sugawara constructions play the
same fundamental role in the ovme that the ane-sugawara constructions play in the
vme.

4.3 constructions on subalgebras

the ovme at order  has solutions l(; ) given by

r (; h) =

r = 0, ...,   1,

  zz+,
0(; h) = 0(h)


  zz+

(4.12b)

(4.12c)

where l(h) is any solution to the ovme on h, h  g (with central charge c(h) and
ground state conformal weight 0(h)). the order  solutions appear at order  because
h  g (see section 2.2).

the subalgebra constructions (4.12) include in particular the orbifold ane-sugawara

construction on h  g,

(4.13b)

for simple g and simple h where r is the index of embedding of h  g.

we also mention the case h = g1 of (4.12), which collects all constructions on the integral

ane subalgebra:

t (; g1) = lab( g) : j (0)

r (; g1) = r,0lab( g)
lab
: ,

c(; g1) = 2lab( g) gab,

0(; g1) = 0

(4.14a)

(4.14b)

where lab( g) is any solution to the vme (3.11b) with gab replaced by gab in (2.3). these
stress tensors are isomorphic to the stress tensors of the vme and the ground state confor-
mal weights vanish, as expected, for all these constructions because lab
0 does not contribute
to 0 in (3.12).

4.4 k-conjugation covariance

at order , the ovme exhibits k-conjugation covariance through the orbifold ane-sugawara
construction tg, which includes the familiar k-conjugation covariance12,18,22,23,1 through the
ane-sugawara construction when  = 1. this means (see app. a) that the k-conjugate
inertia tensor l

(4.15)

lab
r = (lab

r )g  lab

r

is a solution of the ovme when l is a solution, and

t = tg  t ,

c = cg  c,

0 = g

0  0,

(4.16a)

11

t (w) = o((z  w)0)
t is the corresponding k-conjugate stress tensor.

t (z)

where

(4.16b)

drawing on experience with the vme, k-conjugation covariance tells us that the confor-
mal eld theory corresponding to t can be considered as a gauge theory24,25,3,58 in which
the cyclic permutation orbifold of  copies of wzw is gauged by the k-conjugate partner
t of t .

the ovme has another covariance, which we call aut(zz) covariance, that has no analog

in the vme: for any automorphism of zz, the inertia tensor l

l

ab

r = lab

(r),



c

  aut(zz)

(4.17)

is a solution when l is a solution. aut(zz) covariance relates conformal constructions with

4.5 coset constructions
at order , consider the orbifold ane-sugawara construction th  th(; h) on h  g
where g and h are semisimple. (for simple g and h, this construction is given in (4.13)).
the k-conjugate partner of th is the general g/h coset construction,

tg/h =

t = tg  th,

cg/h = c = cg  ch

(4.18)

which includes the ordinary coset constructions12,18,22 at  = 1. the special case of (4.18)
given by kac and wakimoto13,14 is g/g=1, that is  = 1 and h = g with

cg/g=1 = cg/g1 = cg(x)  cg(x).

(4.19)

the extension to g/h=1 was given in ref. 9.

it was conjectured in ref. 9 that the coset construction g/h=1 corresponds to the twisted

sectors of a dierent kind of orbifold

solutions of the ovme and all other solutions will be called new.

5 the lie g-invariant constructions

many consistent ansatze27,3 and subansatze can be found for the ovme, as for the vme. in
this section we concentrate on the lie g-invariant constructions on simple g, whose abundance
is a surprising feature of the ovme. the generalization of the graph theory ansatz on
so(n), familiar28 at  = 1, is also given in app. b.

5.1 group-invariant ansatz

we consider the group-invariant ansatz

2lab

r = lrab,

r = 0, ...,

(5.1)

(ab is the inverse killing metric of g) which collects all lie g-invariant constructions in
the ovme on simple g. we know that this ansatz includes at least the trivial construction

13

l = 0, the orbifold ane-sugawara construction tg, the particular subalgebra constructions
tg, the coset constructions g/g and all orbifold ane-sugawara nests of the form g 
g  ...  g. among these only two constructions survive at  = 1, namely the trivial
construction and the ane-sugawara construction on g. we shall see that the number of
new lie g-invariant constructions increases rapidly with .

we see that the group-invariant ansatz (5.1) is a consistent ansatz, giving  
quadratic equations and unknowns.

2 + 1 coupled

at each level x, it follows that there are

n() = 2 

2 +1

(5.5)

lie g-invariant solutions at order . in fact, these solutions are organized into n() level
families3, according to the high-level behavior28,3

lr =

(5.6)

of each level family. only four of these level families are known at prime , and so there
will be

2 +1  4,
new lie g-invariant level families at these orders.

nnew() = 2 

 prime

(5.7)

the high-level expansion28,3 of the lie g-invariant level families also shows that each level
family is unitary for x = x, x  zz+, at least down to some nite radius of convergence
x0 = x0. experience3 with the vme shows that x0 is usually quite low, for example x0 = 1
or 2 (see also subsecs. 5.2 and 5.3).

we turn now to nding exact solutions of eqs. (5.3b) and (5.4b).

in solving these
equations it was useful to note that only the r = 0 equations have l0 dependence on their
right hand sides, which eectively reduces the number of equations by one. then we were
able to factorize27,3 linear combinations of the r 6= 0 equations through  = 6. we nd no
new solutions d for  = 1, 2, 3 and 4. the results for  = 5 and 6 are reported below.

dfor example the four solutions at  = 2 are the trivial construction, the orbifold ane-sugawara con-

struction, the ane-sugawara construction on the integral ane subalgebra and a kac-wakimoto coset.

eit also follows that the high-level expansions of these level families are convergent down to and including

level x = 1.

as in the previous case, k-conjugation takes (, )  (,).

using the fact that the dual coxeter number hg is positive for all compact lie algebras, we
r , are real for all levels x = 6x, x  zz+ of all compact lie
have checked that , and hence lab
algebras. it follows that these constructions are also unitaryf for these levels and algebras.
for these constructions, both the central charge and the ground state conformal weight

are generically irrational:

(5.11a)

(5.11b)

due to the quantity  in (5.10e). for certain levels the central charge is rational (for example
level x = 6x = 6 of su(2) and su(3)).

at xed g, the central charges increase monotonically with x, and, for the classical lie
algebras (e.g. su(n)), the central charges increase monotonically with n.

the lowest unitary irrational central charge in this family of constructions is therefore

c((e8)x=6,  = 6) =

31471  2.7423

(5.12)

f the high-level expansions of these level families are also convergent through level x = 1.

17

and we note that level x = 6 of e8 corresponds, via the orbifold induction procedure9, to
the historic level x = 1 of e8.

the value (5.12) is less than the lowest known unitary irrational central charge among

the cyclic permutation orbifolds (4.8) at  = 6,

c = 6 c(su(3)5)#

d(1)) = 6 (2)(1

61

)  10.4635

(5.13)

where c(su(3)5)#
d(1)) is the lowest known3 unitary irrational central charge in the vme. the
central charge in (5.12) is also less than c = 6  1 = 6, which is the lower bound on possible
unitary irrational central charge of any order 6 cyclic permutation orbifold.

6 discussion: the lie h-invariant constructions

the solutions above for   6 show that the lie g-invariant constructions of the ovme are
closely related to the lie h-invariant constructions29,3, with h  g, which have been studied
in the vme. following ref. 29, the lie h-invariant constructions of the ovme are those
constructions on g whose inertia tensors are lie h-invariant

r f b)

cd d = 0,

lab

r = lc(a

(6.1)
where a parameterizes the lie group h  g near the origin. then we know from ref. 29
that these constructions occur in lie h-invariant quartets, octets, etc., and the currents of the
lie h-invariant stress tensors are either (1, 0) operators (associated to a global h-symmetry)
or (0, 0) operators (associated to a local h-symmetry).

r = 0, ...,


2

in the case of the ovme, lie h symmetry guarantees at least a global or local h1 sym-
metry, although h symmetry can also appear. for example, the general coset construction
on g/h lives in the lie h-invariant quartet

coset construction itself (

t = tg/h  t with t = 0 or tg/h).

the general lie h-invariant quartet has the form

where t (h  g) is any locally lie h-invariant construction on g (so that t commutes with
the currents of h). the k-conjugation kg/h through the coset construction relates the
two locally-invariant constructions in the quartet, the other two constructions being globally
invariant. for the lie g-invariant ansatz, one should read h  g.

we have checked that the two new sets of constructions at  = 5 and 6 are lie g-invariant

quartets with the form

figure 3: new lie g-invariant quartets at  = 5, 6

so that kg/g1 is conjugation through the kac-wakimoto coset construction in both these
cases. the constructions with  = 1 have a local g-invariance while the constructions with
 = 1 have only a global g-invariance.

to check these conclusions for all the lie g-invariant constructions, we have evaluated

where the matrix m(l) b

2 = 

(6.2a)

(6.2b)

(6.3)

using the reduced ovme (5.2b) of the lie g-invariant ansatz. the result (6.3) veries that
the currents j (0)
of the integral ane subalgebra g=1 are either (1, 0) or (0, 0) operators
a
in all lie g-invariant constructions, as they should be. the specic identications in fig. 3
follow easily from the central charges in (5.8d) and (5.11a).

although all the lie g-invariant constructions have a local or global symmetry associated
to g=1, it is also possible to have larger symmetries associated to h = g,   2. indeed,
there is a quartet at  = 4 associated to g=2. one remaining question is the nature of the
extra (perhaps discrete) symmetry of lab

r which dictates the larger symmetry.

in the case of the  = 5 quartet, one sees further structure because there are only two

independent central charges in (5.8d). in fact, we may write these central charges as

c =

1
2

(cg=5 + cg=1) = 


1
2(cg5 + cg1)

1
2 cg5/g1

(6.4)

which shows that the two g1-local theories ( = 1) have the same central charge, and
moreover that this central charge is exactly half of the central charge of the kac-wakimoto
coset.

local lie h-invariant constructions with c = 1

t and t in

2cg/h, called the self kg/h-conjugate con-
t = tg t are automorphically

structions29,3, are known from the vme, where
equivalent inertia tensors (related by a transformation in aut(h)). the mechanism here, al-
though similar, is not the same: in the present case, conjugation by kg5/g1 (  ) is
an example of the aut(zz) covariance of the ovme (see subsec. 4.4), so that the two
constructions with c = 1

2 cg5/g1 have generically dierent conformal weights.

the central charges in (5.8d) (or (6.4)) can also be written as

c = 5(

cg(x)

2

) + (

cg(5x)

2

),

cg(x) =

xdimg
x + hg

,

x  zz+

(6.5)

20

where cg(x) is the central charge of the ane-sugawara construction on g. since conventional
orbifoldization does not change the central charge of a theory, the form (6.5) suggests that
the new constructions at  = 5 might be twisted sectors of orbifolds which start with copies
of a conformal eld theory whose central charge is c = cg/2. conformal eld theories with
c = cg/2 are in fact known (the self k-conjugate constructions28,3 at  = 1), but these occur
only for dimg = even, leaving us without a conventional orbifold interpretation for the new
constructions at  = 5. for the new constructions at  = 6, we have no suggestion for a
conventional orbifold interpretation.

it is clear from subsec. 4.1 that this interpretational puzzle will dominate at large . it
is our opinion that the ovme provides strong evidence for a large class of new orbifold-like
conformal eld theories.

7 extensions

in this section we consider the feigin-fuchs and the inner-automorphic deformations of
the general virasoro construction on orbifold ane algebra. for   3, further deformations
by the full antisymmetric part of the current bilinears : j[a jb] : may also be possible.

or spectral ow in the twisted sectors of the orbifold-like theories (see also subsec. 7.4), a
phenomenon which is familiar12,30,1 at  = 1.

7.3 deformation of the lie g-invariant constructions

the lie g-invariant constructions of secs. 5 and 6 allow a large class of both the c-changing
and c-xed deformations. in this case we nd that

(7.3c)

where  is given in (6.2b). the result (7.3a) tells us that the extra term in the gener-
alized ovme (7.1b) vanishes, so that the reduced ovme (5.2b) is maintained for c-xed or
c-changing deformations of any lie g-invariant construction.

we have recalled in (7.3c) that all currents j (0)
a

of any lie g-invariant construction are
either (1,0) or (0,0) operators. then (7.3b) tells us that one may deform any lie g-invariant
construction by arbitrary da or da for any j (0)
a which is a (1,0) current (global g symmetry)
of the construction. in particular the orbifold ane-sugawara construction may be deformed
by arbitrary d or d, a fact which is familiar30 for the ane-sugawara constructions at  = 1.

appendix a. derivations

in this appendix we use the machinery of ref. 33 to evaluate all relevant opes.

wicks theorem
given the ope of two operators a and b,

the contraction of the two operators is dened as the singular terms of the ope

a(z)b(w) = xm

{ab}m(w)
(z  w)m

a(z)b(w)  xm>0

{ab}m(w)
(z  w)m .

for any three operators a, b, c we have

a(z) : bc :(w) = iw

a(z)b(x) c(w) + b(x) a(z)c(w) .

(a.3)

symmetry of the bilinears
to prove the symmetry (2.14) of the current bilinears, we use the fact that the commutator
of the normal-ordered bilinear : j j : is related to the derivatives of the singular terms of the
j j ope (2.5a):

matching to the virasoro algebra
we turn now to study the general stress tensor t in (3.1). to evaluate the t t ope set

s = r and u = t in (a.12b) and multiply by
virasoro algebra (3.2) we nd that the third-order pole term is zero since the identities

t . comparing this to the

using the symmetry (2.14) the restriction (3.3) is obtained by matching the second-order

pole terms. the fourth-order pole term gives the quadratic form of the central charge

(a.14)

which can be simplied to the linear form in (3.4) using (3.3).

27

first-order pole
the rst-order pole term in the virasoro algebra (3.2) is guaranteed to be correct because
the higher-order pole terms are correct. to see this explicitly, we write

t (z) t (w) =

c/2

(z  w)4 +

2 t (w)
(z  w)2 +

f (w)
z  w

+ o((z  w)0)

(a.15)

where f (w) is unknown, and this may be relabelled as

t (w) t (z) =

c/2

(w  z)4 +

2 t (z)
(w  z)2 +

f (z)
w  z

+ o((z  w)0)

.

(a.16)

we can determine f by a taylor expansion z = w + (z  w) of (a.15) and its analytic
continuation t (z) t (w) = t (w) t (z):

t (w) t (z) =

c/2

(z  w)4 +

2 t (z)
(z  w)2 +

2z t (z)  f (z)

w  z

+ o((z  w)0)

.

(a.17)

comparing to (a.16) we see that

f (w) = w t (w)

(a.18)

which completes the verication of the virasoro algebra (3.2).

k-conjugation
in parallel with the vme, it is straightforward to check that the k-conjugate partner
lab
r = (lab
r of the ovme is also a solution of the ovme
(use the fact that both (lab

r of any solution lab

r )g and lab

r )g  lab

to see that the stress tensors of k-conjugate constructions commute, we use (a.12b) to

r are solutions).

verify the ope

tg(z) t (w) =

c/2

(z  w)4 +

2 t (w)
(z  w)2 +
= t (z) t (w) + o((z  w)0)

w t (w)
(z  w)

+ o((z  w)0)

(a.19)

and this is easily rearranged into (4.16b).

appendix b. graph theory ansatz on g = so(n)

the graph theory ansatz so(n)diag on so(n)=1 is familiar28,3 from the vme. here we nd
the generalization in the ovme to the ansatz so(n)diag

on so(n).

the inverse inertia tensor in this case has the form

in the vector index notation for the cartesian basis of so(n). substituting into the ovme

n(so(n)diag, ) = 2(

(b.3)

level families for each value of n and . as in the case of the lie g-invariant constructions,
most of these level families will be new, with irrational central charges and (for   2)
generically irrational ground state conformal weights 0.

these orbifold-like level families can be classied by the graphs g

n of order n with  

2+1

colors, according to the high-level behavior28,3:

(b.5)

is the adjacency matrix of any colored graph g
by an edge of color r when ij
called a bond.

r (g

n are connected
n) = 1, and the collection of edges between any i and j is

n. the points i and j of g

the high-level expansion also shows that each level family is unitary for x = x, x  zz+,

at least down to some nite radius of convergence x0 = x0.

in the colored graph theory, the orbifold ane-sugawara construction so(n) lives on
the complete colored graph with n points and  
2 + 1 colors in each bond. as an example,
the graph of the orbifold ane-sugawara construction so(3)=2 is shown (with colors 0 and
1) below

figure 4: the orbifold ane-sugawara construction so(3)=2

so that c = 6 + o(x1) in this case.

many other properties of the level families in this ansatz can be seen in the colored
graphs, in analogy with the application28 of ordinary graph theory at  = 1. as examples,
aut(so(n))-inequivalent level families are in one-to-one correspondence with the (point)
unlabelled colored graphs.
since k-conjugation is through the orbifold ane-sugawara constructions, k-conjugate
level families live on complementary colored graphs.
self k-conjugate constructions28,3, with half the orbifold ane-sugawara central charge

c =

(b.6)

live on self-complementary colored graphs.
