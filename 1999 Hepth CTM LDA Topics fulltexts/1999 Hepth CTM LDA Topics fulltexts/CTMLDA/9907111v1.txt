abstract

we develop the canonical adm approach to 2+1 dimensional gravity in presence

of point particles. the instantaneous york gauge can be applied for open universes or

universes with the topology of the sphere. the sequence of canonical adm equations

is solved in terms of the conformal factor. a simple derivation is given for the solution

of the two body problem. a geometrical characterization is given for the apparent

singularities occurring in the n-body problem and it is shown how the garnier hamil-

tonian system arises in the adm treatment by considering the time development of

the conformal factor at the locations where the extrinsic curvature tensor vanishes.

1 introduction

after the seminal paper by deser jackiw and t hooft [1] the problem of supplying a solution

to 2+1 dimensional gravity has been approached from dierent viewpoints and with dierent

techniques. moncrief [2] and hosoya and nakao [3] gave the hamiltonian treatment in absence

of particles. in [2, 3] the complete reduction of the hamiltonian to the physical parameters i.e.

the moduli of the time slices was obtained in the york (minimal surface) gauge; the problem

can be dealt with explicitly for the torus while for higher genus, even if well dened, is far

from trivial. the solution of [2] and [3] were exploited in [4] and [5] for the quantization of

the theory.

in presence of particles progress was made in the papers by bellini, ciafaloni and val-

tancoli [6] and by welling [7] in the rst order formalism by going over to the instantaneous

gauge; in these papers it was shown that the problem is equivalent to the solution of a

riemann- hilbert problem. it can be solved explicitly for the case of two particles, in terms

of hypergeometric functions. for three or more particles one encounters a feature known

in the mathematical literature as apparent singularities. such apparent singularities evolve

according to a hamiltonian system of equations known as the garnier system [8] which is

derived in the mathematical literature from the isomonodromicity condition.

a dierent approach was put forward by t hooft [9] by describing the evolving cauchy

surfaces in terms of polygonal tiles which join along segments where the extrinsic curvature

1

is singular. the dynamics of the system is codied in transition rules which intervene when

e.g. the length of a side of a polygon goes to zero or when a particle collides with the side

of a polygon. a similar but dierent approach was given by waelbroek [10]. quantization

schemes were given in [11, 12, 13].

in this paper we shall consider 2 + 1 dimensional gravity in presence of massive particles

by exploiting the hamiltonian formulation. most techniques apply to massless particles as

well, but here we shall not be concerned with this case. thus our setting is a second order

formalism and the basic equations are those derived systematically from the variation of

the adm action. the reason for such a development is to give a treatment which resides

completely within the canonical framework. we shall see that all results obtained in [6]

[7] come out in simple fashion from such an approach; moreover we shall prove that the

garnier hamiltonian system is a direct outcome of the canonical adm formalism. again

the exploitation of the instantaneous york gauge plays a major role; the technical advantage

of such a gauge is to reduce an equation of sinh-gordon to one of liouville type to which

powerful methods of complex analysis apply. unfortunately the applicability of such a gauge

is restricted to universes of spherical topology or to open ones.

we shall see that such an approach provides an elementary way to solve the two body

problem: the exact solution of the motion can be derived even before the explicit computation

of the metric, which combined with the qualitative knowledge to the asymptotic metric gives

a complete description of the scattering. the exact metric is obtained by solving a liouville

equation, leading of course to the same results obtained in [6] and [7].

one of the aims of presenting a canonical solution of the problem is to provide a framework

for the quantization of the theory but here we shall be concerned solely with the classical

theory.

the plan of the paper is the following: after recalling in sect.2 the adm canonical for-

mulation of gravity coupled with point particles we proceed in sect.3 to the solution of the

canonical equations. these will be solved in the following order: first one computes the

momenta canonically conjugate to the space metric; they turn out to be rational analytic or

antianalytic functions of the complex coordinates of the plane. the knowledge of such canon-

2

ical momenta allows one to write down the partial dierential equation for the conformal

factor or better for a more fundamental quantity which we shall call the reduced conformal

factor. this is a liouville equation whose sources are located at the particle position; in
addition when the number of particles n is greater than 2 new sources appear. these are
located at the points where the extrinsic curvature tensor vanishes and are identied as the

position of the apparent singularities of the fuchsian dierential equation which underlies

the expression of the conformal factor. in the adm equation for the conformal factor  the

sources appear as function of the conformal factor itself. on the other hand it is shown in
the text that due to the vanishing of the inverse gij of the spacial metric on the particles, the

sources simplify and are just given by the particle masses. the liouville equation admits a

whole family of solutions parametrized by a number m whose values runs from zero to 4

and it is related to the asymptotic behavior of the conformal factor; it is nothing else than

the total energy of the system in adimensional units. a byproduct of the adm equation for

the time derivative of  is that such parameter m is constant i.e. the energy is conserved.
the lagrange multiplier n which appears in the adm metric in the combination n 2dt2
satises a dierential equation, which again due to the vanishing of gij on the particles

reduces to a homogeneous linear dierential equation. this is shown to be simply solved

by the derivative of the conformal factor with respect to the parameter m. an elementary

theorem proves that such a solution is unique. the nal ingredient of the adm metric i.e.
the shift functions n i are expressed in terms of the spacial derivative of n.

in sect.4 we write the hamilton equation for the time variation of the particle positions
and momenta. these are explicited for the general n -body problem in terms of the coecient
of the fuchsian equation which underly the conformal factor. in the two body case, which

is dealt with in sect.5, they give rise to an elementary system of two dierential equations

for the particle positions and momenta, which solved provides the particle trajectories. the

exact metric can be given in term of the classical solution of the liouville equation. in sect.6

we give the general form of the asymptotic metric in the york instantaneous gauge.

in sect.7 we give the treatment of the problem for n > 2. it is shown how the fuchsian
nature of the dierential equation is related to the conservation of momenta and to a gen-

3

eralized conservation law which appears related to the transformation of the action under

space dilatations.

as mentioned above, with more than two particles there are apparent singularities and

one has to provide evolution equations for their positions and residues. we show that

all this information in contained in the adm equation for the the time derivative of the

conformal factor.

in fact by exploiting schwarzs relation between the coecient of the

fuchsian dierential equation and the reduced conformal factor one obtains the garnier

equation by equating the residues at the polar singularities at the position of the apparent

singularities.

b = o(1/|z|2) will give rise, as discussed in sect.3.3 to a well dened asymptotic behavior
of the conformal factor e2  (zz) and n  ln(zz). thus the choice of solutions (14,15)
is a way to impose the form of the asymptotic metric.

as we already mentioned in the introduction and will be shown below, one can apply the

instantaneous york gauge k = 0 only to the topology of the plane (open universes) or the

topology of the sphere. the sphere can be described by the metric

gij =

(16)

where  is a conformal factor regular at innity. the equations for the a

eq.(9,10) and their solution by eq.(14,15). on the other hand for the sphere the point z =

this is reected on the following sum rules on the momenta pn pnz = 0, pn pnzzn = 0,
pn pnzz2

n = 0. thus except for the static case in which all momenta vanish we need at
least four particles on the sphere. in the following we shall be mainly interested in the plane

topology.

the tracelessness of the momenta ij in the k = 0 gauge entails some conservation

laws which relate combinations of particle positions and momenta with no reference to the

eld variables. we shall see in sect.7 that such relations can be derived directly form the

equations of motions.

we want to examine here the expression of the conservation of angular momentum in the

k = 0 gauge in the context of the hamiltonian formalism. under a rotation

and similar transformations on the remaining eld variables, the volume hamiltonian ex-

tended to a disk of radius r and the boundary hamiltonian computed on a circle of radius
n is also left invariant while the term ij gij is left

identically zero. as a consequence the quantity

the k = 0 gauge.

(19)

(20)

integrating eq.(19) over all space and using the gauss-bonnet theorem we see that, due to
the positivity of a

a the k = 0 gauge is applicable only to closed surfaces of genus 0 or

bb

to open universes [7]. we shall be concerned in the following with open universes.

(21)

with pn 2(z) a polynomial of degree n  2, being n the number of particles. it will possess
n 2 zeros in the complex plane and this is the origin in the present approach of the so called
apparent singularities. thus in the adm approach the apparent singularities are given by

8

the zeros of the extrinsic curvature tensor kij because we have the general relation eq.(11)

and in our gauge k = 0. due to the gauss codazzi relations they are also the points where

the intrinsic curvature of the two dimensional time slice vanish. we shall denote by za the

location of the apparent singularities. we shall now go over to the function

near the n particle, which to simplify the notation we suppose to be placed at z = 0,

eq.(23) reduces to

and cn = e2(0). cn cannot be innity otherwise  is not a solution of eq.(24). eq.(24) can
be solved exactly [19] by performing the transformation w = (z/)an on the solution of the
liouville equation 2 = e2 representing the poincare pseudosphere, to obtain

combining such a behavior with the factor a

have that the factor e2 vanishes on the sources, which implies 4an = mn. this simplies

(33)

a solution to eq.(33) must be such c = limr0 ne2 is nite. moreover it is not dicult to
prove that c = 0. in fact by integrating twice eq.(33) in |z| we nd

ln2 |z| + c1 ln|z| + c0,

(34)

which substituted in the denition of c gives c = 0. moreover as for c = 0 the  contribution

in eq.(33) is absent we have also c1 = 0. the conclusion is that n is nite at the particles
and the  term in eq.(32) is absent due to the vanishing of ne2 on the particles and n

satises the linear homogeneous equation

now we analyze the equation

this result holds if the integral appearing in eq.(42) converges. as pn pn = 0 we have
r4 and the integral converges provided 1 +  < 0, which means that the opening
(we notice that with a choice pn pnz 6= 0

the integral in eq.(42) would be divergent). actually one has innite solutions to eq.(40)

of the cone at innity cannot be negative.

depending on the total energy m of the system which has to be specied in solving it. we

shall see at the end of this section that m cannot depend on time.

similarly applying gauss theorem to

(44)

(45)

(46)

the behavior eq.(43) is consistent with the convergence of the integral eq.(46) provided
m/4   < 1 which is the condition we already met. on the other hand it is easily seen
that a behavior n  |z| which makes the integral (46) divergent at innity is inconsistent
with the dierential equation (44).

we want now to connect the solution 2 of eq.(29) with the solutions n of eq.(35). we

already noticed that 2 depends on the free parameter m, which is the total energy of the

system, and such a parameter does not appear in eq.(29). then it is immediately seen that

n =

(2)
m

(47)

is a solution to eq.(35). the equation for n being homogeneous, its normalization is con-

ventional and could also be taken time dependent. with our choice eq.(47), the behavior of

12

n at innity is, from eq.(43) n  1
4 ln(zz). on the other hand it is very simple to prove
the following uniqueness theorem: if n behaves at innity like n  c0 + c1ra, a > 0 and
on the particle singularities as in eq.(39), then n  0.

in fact multiplying by n eq.(35)

which proves our assertion.

3.4 the shift functions

the traceless part of eq.(31) gives

zn z = z

z e2n

zn z =  z

z e2n.

use eq.(44) on the r.h.s. of the rst. then we have

whose general solution is

(49)

(50)

(51)

(52)

(53)

(54)

where g(z) is an analytic function of z. a similar solution holds for n z. the analytic function
g(z) must be chosen as to kill the poles generated by the zeros of  z

z(z), which occur only in
presence of three or more particles, and if we are interested in describing a reference system
which does not rotate at innity g(z) has to be chosen as to give n z < |z| at innity. we
shall see in sect.7 that, due to pn pnz = 0, such a function can diverge at innity at most

linearly. as we shall see g(z) encodes the time evolution of all the quantities of the problem.

the trace part of eq.(31) gives

2  = n zz(2) + zn z + c.c.

by substituting the asymptotic behavior for 2 eq.(43) into eqs.(54,55) we see that
as the logarithmic term m ln(zz)/4 on the l.h.s. is not matched on the r.h.s..

(55)

m = 0

4 the particle equations of motion

in the present section we shall derive the general expression for the time derivative of the

particle position zn and of the particle conjugate momenta pn.

variation of the action with respect to pnz gives

the equation for pn

zn = n i(zn, t) = g(zn).

pni =

(cid:16)pnan a  nppnapnbgab + m2

(56)

(57)

requires a little attention because in general the metric is divergent at the particle position.

let us consider the expression of pn

gij(zn)( zj

n + n j)
n + n i)( zj

n + n j)

.

(58)

n + n j = 0 but it does not mean that pni = 0 as gij = gije2
at the point z = zn we have zj
is divergent at that point. we have to compute the behavior of n z(z)  n z(zn) for z  zn.

pni = mn

qn 2  gij( zi

from eq.(54) we have

the square root in the denominator goes over to n(zn) and thus in the limit z  zn we have

(61)

gzj(zn)( zj

n + n j)
n + n i)( zj

n + n j)  pnz.

qn 2  gij( zi

with regard to the convergence of the numerator we notice that it is of the type

((z  zn)(z  zn))n|((z  zn)(z  zn))n + o(z  zn) + o(z  zn)|

(62)

which converges absolutely to 1 only for n < 1/2 i.e. for not too heavy particle. on the

other hand if we average the l.h.s. of eq.(61) on a circle around zn and then take the limit

for zero radius it always converges to pnz. we nd a similar problem in writing the equation
for pnz. taking into account the behavior eqs.(39,59) of the functions n and n z for z  zn,
eq.(57) becomes

pnz = pna

n a
z  mn

n
z

(63)

and a similar equation for pnz. eq.(63) has to be understood as taking the average over a
circle around zn and then taking the limit for zero radius. the procedure is similar to the

one adopted in [18]. the situation is analogous to the one which occurs in electrostatics in

presence of point charges. the electric eld is innite or better not dened on the particle,

but the average of the electric eld on a small sphere surrounding the particle gives the

eective eld which acts on the particle as in such a process the eld generated by the

particle itself averages to zero and what survives is the external eld. we shall see several

application of such equations in the following.

15

5 the two body problem

5.1 the conformal factor

in the two particle case the equation for  has only two sources.

(2) = e2 + 4(1  1)2(z  z1) + 4(1  2)2(z  z2)

(64)

and we have no apparent singularities as  z

z(z) has no zeros in the complex plane. the

procedure for solving such equation is well known [19]

e2 =

8f (z) f (z)
(1  f (z) f (z))2

(65)

where the function f (z) is given by the ratio of two independent solutions of the second

order fuchsian dierential equation with two regular singularities in z1 and z2 and one at

innity [20]

f (z) =

ky1(z)
y2(z)

.

(66)

in fact neglecting for the moment the sources one has simply to check that, being
ln(f (z) f (z)) an harmonic function,

(1  f f )2
on the singularities the dierence of the indices given by [20]

4f  f ln(1  f f )2 = 

8

.

y1  (z  zn)n,

y2  (z  zn)n

has to be such that on the singularity the term ln(f (z) f (z)) gives

4zz(n  n  1) ln((z  zn)(z  zn)) = 4(1  n)2(z  zn)

i.e. n  n = n. the dierential equation for y is provided by

y() + q()y() = 0

16

(67)

(68)

(69)

(70)

with  = (z  z1)/(z2  z1) and

q() =

(cid:19) .

(71)

in fact with two singularities at the nite and one at innity the linear residues are xed

by the fuchs relations in terms of the 1, 2 and  (see also eq.(127)). to understand the

behavior at innity let us rewrite

e2 =

8w12 w12

(y2y2  kk y1 y1)2

(72)

where w12 = k(y

1y2  y1y

2) is the constant wronskian. from eq.(72) we see that at innity

2  (1 + ) ln( )

or

2 = 2 + ln(a

bb

a) 

m
4

ln( )  2 ln( )

(73)

(74)

i.e.  = 1  m/4  1  .
a further requirement on the mapping function f is to give a well dened, i.e. monodromic
 when one goes around the singularities 0, 1 and consequently  in the variable . from
the general theory of fuchsian dierential equations we know that the vector (ky1, y2) goes

over to a sl(2, c) transformed vector (ay1 + by2, cy1 + dy2) due to the constancy of the
wronskian. from eq.(72) we see that in order that e2 be well dened we need

 a b
c d!  su(1, 1).

(75)

the simplest way to realize this constraint is to choose f = ky1/y2 with y1 and y2 behaving

as in eq.(68); then f satises the monodromicity condition around the point  = 0 for any

k. the point now is to determine k such as the  is monodromic also around the point 1
and as a consequence at . for completeness we give in the appendix the expression of y1,
y2 and the derivation of k.

17

the so determined value of k gives through eq.(72) and eq.(22) the conformal factor e2.

then we obtain n from

n =

(2)
m

(76)

whose behavior for large |z| we already know to be n  1

4 ln(zz).

5.2 determination of the trajectory

it is interesting that in order to write down and solve the equations of motion of the particles

we do not need to know the explicit form of 2 and n. in fact from eq.(56) we see that
what we need is n z in z1 and z2. for two particles let

from which

and thus

zn + g(z).

the rst term at innity behaves like



z

pz(z2  z1)

(77)

(78)

(79)

(80)

(81)

and in order to have a non rotating reference frame at innity we must choose g(z) such as

to remove this divergent behavior at innity i.e.

g(z) =

z

pz(z2  z1)

.

18

(82)

as  z

z has poles in z1, z2 we have

z1 = n z(z1) = g(z1) = 

z1

pz(z2  z1)

;

z2 = 

z2

pz(z2  z1)

and then dening l = z1  z2 we have

l =

1
pz

.

(83)

(84)

we now turn to the equation for pz. we show in general i.e.
for any number of particles
that pz is given in terms of the residue of the simple poles at the point zn of the function
q(z) which appears in the fuchsian dierential equation.

let the singularity at zn be

q(z) =

1  2
4z2 +

n

n
2z

+ qn(z)

(85)

where for the time being z denotes the dierence z  zn. the expansion of the singular
solution y2 around the singularity is

with

y2 = z

(1 + bnz + o(z2))

bn =

2(1  n)

.

then substituting into eq.(63) we have in the limit z  zn

pnz = pna

+ pnzg(zn).

as we already mentioned, such formulas hold in the general n -particle system.
specic two particle case we have from eq.(71)

(89)

where working in the z variable the s get divided by z2z1 with respect to the s appearing
in eq.(71). substituting into eq.(88) we have

pz =

4(z2  z1)

=



z2  z1

.

thus we have to solve the elementary system

l =

pz

;

pz =

taking the time derivative of the rst equation and introducing the variable  =

which agrees with the solution given in [6].

it is interesting that the same solution can be obtained using simply the rst of eq.(91)
l = 1/pz and the general conservation laws we shall derive in sect.7. for two particles

i.e.

the conserved angular momentum is given by

l = xn=1,2

i pnj = i(lpz  lpz).
n j
xi

on the other hand eq.(131) gives for two particles

which gives

lpz + lpz = 2(1  )t + const

lpz = (1  )t  i

l

using now l = 1/pz we reach immediately the solution eq.(93).

20

(94)

(95)

(96)

6 the asymptotic metric

in the previous section we gave the exact metric for the two particle case.

in case of n
particles again the solution of the liouville equation is given by eq.(72) where y1, y2 are
solution of a fuchsian dierential equation with singularity at innity of index  = 1 
m/4  1  . then the asymptotic behavior of  for large z is given by

2 = 2 ln(y2 y2  k2y1y1)  ln|w12|2  (2  ) ln(zz)  k2(zz)1 + ...

thus

it follows that the asymptotic behavior of n is

e2  const (zz).

n =

(2)
m 

1
4

ln(zz) +

k2
4

ln(zz)(zz)1 + ...

and then

(97)

(98)

(99)

(100)

n z = const z(cid:0)1 + k2(  1) ln(zz)(zz)1 + ....(cid:1) + g(z).

if g(z) is chosen as to remove the behavior proportional to z (non-rotating frame at innity)
the behavior of n z becomes

n z  const z ln(zz)(zz)1.

(101)

formulas (98,99,101) provide the general asymptotic behavior of the metric.

in this formalism the appearance of a gott pair is signalled by an oscillating behavior of
f (z) as |z|   (the total mass is now an imaginary number)[6]. this pathological behavior
is not surprising because both the formalism and the gauge used here assume the existence

of a global time.

7 the n -particle case
we shall consider in this section the n -particle case with particular attention to n = 3.
again the key role is played by the conformal factor e2 or equivalently e2 which is given

21

by eq.(65) where y1, y2 are solution of a fuchsian dierential equation. it is interesting that

n can be rewritten in the following form

where

in fact

n =

g(f )

f

2 fg(f )

g(f ) =

f
m

.

(2)
m

=

+

2 f g(f )
1  f f

+ c.c.

and it is easily checked that

1
f 

f 
m

=



f (cid:18) f

m(cid:19) .

with regard to the conjugate momenta we have

(102)

(103)

(104)

(105)

(106)

 z

z(z) =

pn 2(z)

qn(z  zn)

where as pn pn = 0, pn 2(z) is a polynomial of degree n  2. in at space the number
of lorentz invariants is easily seen to be 3n  3 as for n > 3 the 2 + 1-vector pn is
determined by the scalar product of pn with p1, p2, p3. in curved space we have the same

number of invariants. as it is well known here the invariants are replaced by the traces

of the holonomies around the world lines of an arbitrary collection of particles [1, 21, 22].

the parallel transport monodromy matrices which belong to so(2, 1) or in the fundamental

representation to su(1, 1) are dened up to a conjugation. keeping in mind that every
su(1, 1) holonomy has three real degrees of freedom we have 3n degrees of freedom to
which we have to subtract the three degrees of freedom of the su(1, 1) conjugation thus

reaching as expected the same number of invariants as in the at case.

given at the time t = 0 the position zn and the momenta pn of the particles we know

from eq.(14) also the position of the apparent singularities za. knowledge of the masses mn

in order to understand the problem better let us consider the case n = 3. it is useful to

go over from the equation in projectively canonical form

(114)

with  = ( + ). here we use the unconstrained parameterization of ref.[8]; the

connection with the parameters n and n can be easily obtained by comparing the residues

in eq.(110).

the parameters i and  are free real parameters which give the trace of the holonomies

around the particles and innity (total energy). za is given in terms of the zn and the pn

(n = 1, 2, 3) while h is given by the no-logarithm condition i.e. the requirement that the

point za is a regular point for 2 [8]. such h is easily found

h =

za(za  1)(za  z3)

za(za  1)(cid:27) .

(115)

thus we have the following free real parameters 1, 2, 3, , re(za), im(za), re(ba), im(ba)

which are eight real parameters, to be contrasted with the six real invariants we have enumer-

ated at the beginning of this section. the reason is that the constraint that the holonomies

described by eq.(109) belong to su(1, 1), xes the value of re(ba), im(ba) in terms of all

other parameters. the explicit form of this relation has been investigated in the mathemat-

ical literature [24] but we are not aware of any explicit form of it. adding a new particle

introduces a new particle singularity with exponent 4 i.e. p(z) acquires a new term of the

type

1  4
z  z4

(116)

but in addition a new apparent singularity is generated say at zb. the indices of this

new singularity have to be integers, 0 and 2 while the new simple residue bb has to be a

function of all other parameters, and in particular of zb, because the su(1, 1) character

of the holonomies allow only an increase of 3 in the number of free real parameters i.e.

4, rezb, imzb, but as we said above we do not know an explicit solution of this problem.

adding other particles does not alter the procedure.

we come now to the problem of determining the change in time of the position of the
particles zn and of the position of the apparent singularities zb. if f (z) = ky1(z)
y2(z) provides a
monodromic 2, n is still given by eq.(47) as the sources are independent of m; the equation

24

for n z, n z are solved as before by

n z = 

2
z(z)

 z

zn + g(z).

(117)

the new fact with respect to the two particle case is that now  z

z(z) has n  2 zeros in the

complex plane which are the position of the apparent singularities. we write

 z

z(z)
2



=

1

4xn

pnz
z  zn

= qb(z  zb)

p(z)

.

(118)

taking the derivative of the previous equation with respect to z and then setting z = za we

obtain a relation which will be useful in the following

pnz

(za  zn)2 = 4qb6=a(za  zb)

p(za)

xn

which for a single apparent singularity reduces to

pnz

(za  zn)2 = 

4
p(za)

.

xn

the general expression of n z is

n z =

and thus to remove the poles from n z we must have

zn + g(z)

p(z)

qb(z  zb)

(119)

(120)

(121)

g(z) =xb

b
m

1

z  zb

where p1(z) is a polynomial, as

p(zb)

qc6=b(zb  zc)

+ p1(z),

(122)

zn(zb) = 

b
m

.

(123)

in fact the expansion of the singular solution around the apparent singularity za is given by

y2 = (z  za) 1

2 (1 +

a
2

(z  za) + o((z  za)2))

(124)

25

which substituted in 2 gives the above result. recalling the equation of motion of zn we

have now

zn = n z(zn) = g(zn) = xb

b
m

1

zn  zb

p(zb)

qc6=b(zb  zc)  p1(zn).

(125)

thus the time variation of zn is given in terms of the momenta pn which determine completely
the polynomial p(z) and the derivative with respect to m of the residues a.

we come now to the equations for pn. we already saw on general grounds that

pnz = 4

xn

b = 0;

(128)

we see that provided p1(z) is a rst degree polynomial, p(z) = c0 + c1z, the consistency of

the equation pn pn = 0 is assured by the the rst equation in (128). similarly one easily

checks that the second relation in eq.(128) provides the law

znpnz =

d

dtxn

zn pnz = (1 

m

d

dtxn

(129)

where we have exploited eq.(119) and pn pnz/(zb  zn) = 0. such equation gives both the

law of conservation of angular momentum

l =

i(znpnz  zn pnz) = 0

26

(130)

which we derived in sect.3 and the generalized conservation law

(znpnz + zn pnz) = 2(1

)

d

dtxn

(131)

which appears to be related to a dilatation transformation [23]. to complete the scheme we

must provide the expression of the time derivative of the position of the apparent singularities

za and the time derivatives of the simple residues at such singularities a. the equation for

za is easy to obtain. one takes the time derivative of

0 =xn

pnz
za  zn

(132)

which allows to express za in terms of zn and pnz which are already known. using eq.(132)
and eq.(119) we obtain

.

(136)

in order to connect with the mathematical literature we shall choose the meromorphic func-

tion g(z) such as to keep the position of particle 1 at 0 and of particle 2 at 1. for clarity we

= n zz(2) + zn z + n zz(2) + zn z

(141)

evaluated in the neighborhood of an apparent singularity. the above equation embodies

part of the information carried by the dynamical equation for gij.

it is more useful to rewrite equation (141) in terms of the reduced conformal factor
z). in order to accomplish this we need the evolution equation for  z
z
b. these are given, outside the particle singularities

z i.e. for the traceless part of a

2 = 2  ln(2z
and z

using eqs.(55,142) we reach

2  = g(z)z(2)  g(z) + c.c.

28

(142)

(143)

we now recall the fundamental relation of the theory of fuchsian dierential equation [8, 19],
which can be easily proved starting from eq.(65) which holds in the general n -particle case

q(z) = 

1
2

[2

z (2) +

1
2

(z(2))2]

(144)

where the r.h.s. plays the role of the analytic component of the energy momentum tensor

in two dimensional conformal liouville theories. taking the time derivative of eq.(144) we

have

q(z) =

1
2

g(z) + 2g(z)q(z) + g(z)q(z).

(145)

it is interesting that this equation contains the whole system of the garnier equations for the

time evolution of the apparent singularities. if we laurent-expand g(z) about the apparent

singularity za

and

g(z) =

the fourth order poles in eq.(145) cancel identically without producing any information; the

matching of the residue of the third order pole gives

(148)

(149)

29

eq.(148) reproduces the results obtained in eq.(135), as can be seen by computing g1 and

g0 form eq.(122). as an example we can apply the above equations to the three particle

case. if we keep particle 1 at 0 an particle 2 at 1, the g(z) function takes the form

g(z) = p(za)

it is important to remark that the matching of the residues of eq.(145) on the particle
singularities reproduce the equation of motion z = g(zn).

8 conclusions

it is useful to summarize here the basic features of our derivations which are rather straight-
forward. in the instantaneous york gauge k = 0 the momenta a

b allows us to write a liouville equation for the reduced conformal factor , in
which the sources are the particle singularities i.e. the poles of  z
z and the apparent singu-
larities, i.e. the zeros of  z
z. the function n is given by the derivative of  with respect to
the total energy while n z is given in terms of n by

z (z

n z =

 z

zn + g(z),

where g(z) is a meromorphic function which cancels the polar singularities of the rst term

and grows at innity not faster than z. the linear term in g(z) is xed if we want to deal

with a reference frame which does not rotate at innity.

the equation of motion for the particle position are zn = n z(zn) = g(zn) while those

for the particle momenta

pnz = pnazn a  mnzn.

(155)

on the other hand the change in time of the position of the apparent singularities and their
residues are given by the adm equation for  computed on the apparent singularities, thus

providing the garnier hamiltonian system.

in the solution for n and consequently in g(z) and pn there appears the derivative with
respect to the total energy m of the coecients of the fuchsian dierential equation which

underlies the determination of . i.e. the change in the s has to be such as to remain in

the su(1, 1) class of dierential equation. it has a very simple solution in the case of two

particles while in general it is obviously related to the riemann-hilbert problem even if it is

less specic.

the two solutions of eq.(70) which near the origin are a power multiplied by an analytic

function are given by [25]

under a circuit around point 1 they mix as ui  bi1u1 + bi2u2 and thus the demand that
(ky1, y2) transforms under a representation of su(1, 1) imposes

we have [25]

which gives

b12 = 2i ei(cab)

(c  a)(c  b)(b)(a)

b21 = 2i ei(cab)

(2  c)(1  c)

(1  a)(1  b)(1 + a  c)(1 + b  c)

|k2| = |(a)(b)(1  c)(2  c)(c  a)(c  b)|

where as usual (x)  (x)/(1  x).
