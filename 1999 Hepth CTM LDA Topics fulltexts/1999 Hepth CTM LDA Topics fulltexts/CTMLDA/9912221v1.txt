we review the appearance of hopf algebras in the renormalization of
quantum eld theories and in the study of dieomorphisms of the frame
bundle important for index computations in noncommutative geometry.

1 introductory remarks

this contribution focuses on two applications discovered during the last two years
of the hopf algebra of rooted trees. they suggest an amazing link between
mathematics and physics. there exists an excellent review [1] of these topics,
written by the authors of these ideas. in what follows i am going to explain parts
of this development which i was able to understand. i hope it can be useful to
somebody else.

in mathematics, foliations provide a large class of examples of noncommuta-
tive spaces and lead to an index problem for the transverse hypoelliptic operator
[2]. the computation of the cocycles in the local index formula turned out to be
extremely lengthy even in dimension one. alain connes and henri moscovici [3]
were looking for an organizing principle for that calculation, which they found
in the cyclic cohomology of a hopf algebra ht obtained by the action of vector
elds on a crossed product of functions by dieomorphisms.

concerning physics, dirk kreimer [4] discovered that a perturbative quantum
eld theory carries in a natural way a hopf algebra structure hr given by oper-
ations on feynman graphs. the antipode reproduces precisely the combinatorics
of renormalization, i.e. it produces the local counterterms to make the divergent
integral corresponding to the feynman graph nite.

noticing that both hopf algebras have formally a very similar structure,
connes and kreimer gave the precise relation [5] between ht and hr. this
is very transparent in the language of rooted trees they used. the commutative
hopf subalgebra h1 of connesmoscovici is (in dimension 1) a hopf subalgebra
of kreimers hopf algebra for a quantum eld theory with a single primitively
divergent graph.

recently it was pointed out [6] that the same algebra of rooted trees plays a

role in rungekutta methods of numerical analysis.

2 the hopf algebra of connesmoscovici

in principle, the hopf algebra of connes and moscovici can be understood from
classical dierential geometry [7]. we give here a somewhat shortened version of
the derivation and refer to [8] for more details. we recommend [9] for a useful
introduction to hopf algebras and related topics.

we regard the frame bundle f + of a manifold m and in particular the vector
elds on f +. there is a natural notion of vertical vector elds, these are the
tangent vectors to curves in f + obtained by the right action of the group gl+(n)
of n  n matrices with positive determinant. the horizontal vector elds are not
canonically given, they are determined once a connection is specied. for our
purpose we can work in local coordinates.

let {x}=1...,n be the coordinates of x  m within a local chart of m and
{y
i },i=1,...n be the coordinates of n linearly independent vectors of the tangent
space txm with respect to the basis . on f + there exist the following geomet-
rical objects, written in terms of the local coordinates (x, y

i ) of p  f +:

1) an rn-valued (soldering) 1-form  with i = (y1)i

dx ,

2) a gl(n)-valued (connection) 1-form  with i

j = (y1)i

(dy

j + 

 y

j dx),

where 

 depends only on x ,

3) n2 vertical vector elds y i

j = y

j i

 ,

4) n horizontal (with respect to ) vector elds xi = y

i (  

y

j j

) .

a local dieomorphism  of m has a lift  : (x, y
i ) 7 ((x),  (x)y
i )
to the frame bundle and induces the following transformations of the previous
geometrical objects:

.



(dy

1) ( )(cid:12)(cid:12)p = (cid:12)(cid:12)p
2) ( )(cid:12)(cid:12)p = (y1)i
(cid:12)(cid:12)x = (((x))1)
i )(cid:12)(cid:12)p = y j
i (cid:12)(cid:12)p
 xi)(cid:12)(cid:12)p = y

3) ( y j

4) ( 1

,

we refer to [8] for the proof.

 y

j dx) is again a connection form, with
(x)(x) + (((x))1)

 (x) ,

j + 
 

(cid:12)(cid:12)(x)

i (  

y

j j

) is horizontal to  .

given these tools of classical dierential geometry, the new idea is to apply
the vector elds x, y to a crossed product a = c 
c (f +) >  of the algebra of
smooth functions on f + with compact support by the action of the pseudogroup
 of local dieomorphisms of m. as a set, a can be regarded as the tensor
product of c 

c (f +) with . it is generated by the monomials

f u 

 ,

f  c 

c (dom( )) ,    ,

(1)

2

where  is the dieomorphism of f + obtained as the lift of   . as an algebra,
the multiplication rule in a is dened by

f1u 

1 f2u 

2 := f1(f2  1)u 

21 .

(2)

here, the function f1(f2  1) evaluated at p (in the domain of denition) gives
f1(p) f2( 1(p)), i.e. we have a non-local product on the function algebra.

the action of vector elds on a is dened as the action on the function part.
interesting is the application to the product (2), because the non-locality in the
function part leads to a deviation from the leibniz rule. for v being a vector
eld on f + one computes

v (f1u 

1 f2u 

2) = v (f1u 

1) f2u 

2 + f1u 

1 (cid:0) 1(v )(cid:1)(cid:0)f2u 

2(cid:1) .

(3)

since dieomorphisms and right group action commute, we get the unchanged
leibniz rule for the vertical vector elds,

y j
i (ab) = y j

i (a) b + a y j

i (b) ,

a, b  a .

(4)

for the horizontal vector elds, however, there will be an additional term
a(1xi  xi)(b). comparing 4), 4) and 3) above we have 1xi  xi = k
jiy j
k ,
for some function k
ji. using (2) we commute this function in front of a and obtain

xi(ab) = xi(a) b + a xi(b) + k

ji(a) y j

k (b) ,

a, b  a .

the operator k

ji on a is computed to

ji(f u 
k

) = (

  

)y

j y

i (y1)k

 ,

where

 are the connection coecients belonging to . it turns out that k

ji

k
ji(ab) = k

ji(a) b + a k

ji(b) .

(7)

these formulae can now be interpreted in the dual sense, for instance xi(ab) =
(xi) (a  b), which leads to a structure of a coalgebra on the linear space
r(1, xi, y j

ji) = k

ji ,

ji  y j

k ,

(8)

with 1 being the identity on a. coassociativity (  id)   = (id  )   is
easy to check.

vector elds form a lie algebra, so the next step is to ask whether

r(1, xi, y j

k , k

[y i
[y k
[y i

leads to new generators, because curvature r and torsion  are no structure
constants. therefore, one uses a dierent strategy and considers instead of a a

morita equivalent algebra a based on a at manifold n = ` u  the disjoint

union of the charts u of m. now, there is neither curvature nor torsion, and
horizontal vector elds commute. there remain the commutators of x with ,
which lead indeed to new generators of the lie algebra:

ji,1...n(f u 
k

) := [xn, . . . , [x1, k

= n . . . 1(cid:16)(((x))1)

ji] . . .](f u

 .

now having established a lie algebra, we call h its enveloping algebra, i.e.
the algebra of polynomials in {1, xi, y k
ji,1...n...}, with the commutation
relations inherited from the lie algebra. with the coproduct  on the lie algebra,
h becomes automatically a bialgebra, where the coproduct is dened via the
algebra homomorphism axiom:

j , k

ji, k

(h1h2) = (h1) (h2) := x h1
1h1

2  h2

1h2

(hi) = x h1

i  h2
i ,

(12)

for h1, h2  h. the counit  : h  c is dened by

(1) = 1c ,

(h) = 0 h 6= 1 .

(13)

the counit axiom (  id)  (h) = (id  )  (h) = h is straightforward to
check.

there also exists an antipode on h which makes it to a hopf algebra. the

antipode is the unique antiautomorphism of h satisfying

s(h1h2) = s(h2)s(h1) ,

m  (s  id)  (h) = 1(h) = m  (id  s)  (h) ,

(14)

for h, h1, h2  h, and where m denotes the multiplication. from the second line
and (8) one easily obtains

s(1) = 1 ,

k ,
ji) = k
ji ,

s(y j
s(k
s(xi) = xi + k

jiy j

k .

(15)

the action of s on the other generators of h can be derived from (14).

the purpose of this hopf algebra h is to ease the computation [3] of cocycles
in the local index formula [2] of connes and moscovici. so far i did not study
this calculation for myself, but i think a good way to learn it would be to consult
[10].

3 rooted trees

coproduct and antipode for the generators k
ji,1...n... are only recursively dened
via the axioms of coproduct and antipode. now we are going to present an explicit
solution  via the concept of rooted trees. this was introduced by connes and
kreimer [5] to clarify the relation between the two hopf algebras in the theory
of foliations and in perturbative quantum eld theory. we generalize [8] their
construction from dimension 1 to arbitrary dimension of the manifold m. to the
rst three classes of s we associate the following trees:

ji ,

ji =  k

the rule is obvious. a symbol k
ji,a, for a a string of |a| indices, is obtained
from k
a a new vertex with label
 successively to the right of each vertex. the root (with three indices) remains
the same and order is important.

a by attaching to each of its trees t|a|

ji,a = p|a|!

a=1 t|a|

coproduct and antipode require the denition of cuts of a tree. an elementary
cut along a chosen edge splits a tree into two  the trees above (trunk) and below
(cut branch) the cut. it is clear that we have to add 2 indices to complete the root
of the cut branch. this will be a pair of summation indices. we dene the action
of a cut as the shift of one index of the vertex above the cut to the rst position
of the new root of the cut branch. the remaining position to complete the root of
the cut branch is lled with a summation index and the same summation index
is put into the vacant position of the trunk. in the case of cutting immediately
below the root, we have to sum over the three possibilities of picking up indices of
the root, adding a minus sign if we pick up the unique upper index. the following
examples illustrate the denition of a cut, where we write the trunk as the rhs of
the tensor product and the cut branch as the lhs:

(17)

a multiple cut consists of several elementary cuts, where the order of cuts is from
top to bottom and from left to right. an admissible cut is a multiple cut such
that on the path from any vertex to the root there is at most one elementary cut.

5

the product of all cut branches forms the lhs of the tensor product, whereas the
trunk alone containing the old root serves as the rhs.

the purpose of these denitions is to give an explicit formula for coproduct

and antipode. indeed, by induction one can prove the following:

proposition 1 the coproduct of k

ji,a = p|a|!

a=1 t|a|

a

|a|!

is given by

(k

ji,a) = k

ji,a  1 + 1  k

ji,a +

xa=1 xc

p c(t|a|

a )  rc(t|a|

a ) ,

(18)

where for each t|a|
rc(t|a|
t|a|
a

a ) is the trunk and p c(t|a|
via the multiple cut c.

a

the sum is over all admissible cuts c of t|a|
a .

in eq. (18),
a ) the product of cut branches obtained by cutting

proof. we start from

ji,a) = [(k
(k
ji,a), (x)] = k
ji,a = [x  1 + 1  x, rk
rk

ji,a  1 + 1  k
ji,a] + [m

n  y n

ji,a + rk

ji,a ,
ji,a + (1  k

m, rk

ji,a)]  h  h .

by denition of the tree, the commutator with x attaches a vertex  successively
to all previous vertices, where x  1 attaches to the cut branches and 1  x
attaches to the trunk. next, the commutator with m
m puts for each vertex
of the trunk (due to the commutator with y ) a cut branch consisting of a single
vertex to the lhs of the tensor product. both contributions together yield precisely
all admissible cuts of the trees corresponding to k

n  y n

ji,a.

the antipode is obtained by applying the antipode axiom m  (s  id)   = 0

to (18). by recursion one proves

proposition 2 the antipode s of k

is given by

ji,a = p|a|!

a=1 t|a|

a

|a|!

s(k

ji,a) = k

ji,a 

xa=1 xca

(1)|ca| p ca(t|a|

a ) rca(t|a|

a ) ,

(19)

where the sum is over the set of all non-empty multiple cuts ca of t|a|
(multiple
cuts on paths from bottom to the root are allowed) consisting of |ca| individual
cuts.

4 feynman graphs and rooted trees

in a perturbative quantum eld theory it is convenient to symbolize contribu-
tions to greens functions by feynman graphs. these feynman graphs stand for
analytic expressions of momentum variables. internal momentum variables have
to be integrated out. very often some of these integrations formally yield innity.
the art of obtaining meaningful results out of these integrals is called renormal-
ization. a central problem is the existence of subdivergences which cannot be
regularized by a simple subtraction of the divergent part. bogoliubov [11] found

6

a recursion formula for the regularization of feynman graphs with subdivergences
and zimmermann gave an explicit solution  the forest formula [12].

in 1997 dirk kreimer discovered [4] that there is the structure of a hopf
algebra behind this art of renormalization, with the combinatorics of the forest
formula produced by the antipode. kreimers idea was to visualize the divergence
structure of feynman graphs in terms of parenthesized words, which are in 1:1
correspondence to rooted trees [5]. let us exemplify this idea by a feynman

straight lines stand for fermions and wavy lines for bosons, and the boxes contain
divergent sectors. a criterion for supercial divergence of a region conned in
a box is power counting.
if a box has nb bosonic and nf fermionic outgoing
legs, the power counting degree of divergence d is (in four dimensions) dened by
d := 4  nb  3
2 nf  0. owing to symmetries the actual degree of divergence of
one graph or a sum of graphs can be lower than d, see [13]. the construction of
the rooted tree from the feynman graphs with identied divergent sectors is clear:
the outermost (supercial) divergence (5) is the root v5. the box (5) contains
the boxes (3) and (4) as immediate subdivergences, hence we connect two vertices
p3 and v4 directly to the root v5. the box (4) contains the subdivergences (1)
and (2), so we attach the vertices s1 and v2 to v4. this works as long as there are
no overlapping divergences, which must be resolved before in terms of disjoint
and nested ones and lead to a sum of rooted trees [14, 15].

having identied the trees to feynman graphs, it are the same cutting opera-
tions on trees as before which give us coproduct and antipode. here, a cut splits
a feynman graph into several subgraphs  a standard operation in renormaliza-
tion. it is very remarkable that the antipode obtained in this way reproduces the
combinatorics of renormalization [4]. these surprising facts have been extended
to a complete renormalization of a toy model [16], which we review in the next
section.

before, let us ask an interesting question: what is the role of the operators
k
ji,1...n in quantum eld theory, and what is the meaning of the individual trees
for dieomorphisms? i am not aware of an answer, but there is an interesting
observation [8] concerning the relation of the decorated rooted trees (16) to feyn-
man graphs. the trees emerging from the connesmoscovici hopf algebra are
decorated by spacetime indices (three for the root) whereas in qft the decora-
tion is a label for divergent feynman graphs without subdivergences. although
the operators  are invariant under permutation of the indices after the comma,
for instance k
ji,ml, see (11), this symmetry is lost on the level of individual
trees. that leads us to speculate that the sum of feynman graphs according to

ji,lm = k

7

the collection of rooted trees to s has more symmetry than the individual feyn-
man graphs. this should be checked in qft calculations. another interpretation
would be the observation from (16)

which could possibly be regarded as a relation between feynman graphs similar
to those derived in [17]. according to a private communication by kreimer, (21)
is satised in qft for the leading divergences, as it can be derived from sec.
v.c in [18]. for non-leading singularities there will be (probably systematic)
modications.

in mathematics, connes and kreimer extended the investigation of the com-
mutative hopf subalgebra h1 in [3] to the level of individual trees [5]. they
showed that the hopf algebra of rooted trees hr is the solution of a universal
problem in hochschild cohomology. we recall [3] that h1 is the dual of the en-
veloping algebra of the lie algebra l1 of formal vector elds on r vanishing to
order 2 at the origin, and that h1 itself is isomorphic to the hopf algebra of
coordinates on the group of dieomorphisms of r of the form (x) = x + o(x).
by analogy, connes and kreimer regard hr as the hopf algebra of coordinates
on a nilpotent formal group g whose lie algebra l1 they succeed to compute.
this group was recently found to be related to the butcher group in numeri-
cal analysis [6]. it will certainly contain precious information for quantum eld
theory because the antipode in hr governing renormalization is the dual of the
inversion operation in g. renormalization seems to provide a new mathematical
calculus which generalizes dierential calculi.

5 a toy model: iterated integrals

in the spirit of kreimer [16] we are going to give the reader a feeling for renormal-
ization by considering a toy model. the toy model is given by iterated divergent
integrals, in close analogy to qft. the only dierence is that the integrals are
very simple to compute.

let us take the integral

1(t) = z 

t

dp1
p1+
1

,

(22)

which diverges logarithmically for   0. we can regard it as the analytic
expression to the feynman graph

to a feynman graph with subdivergence there corresponds an iterated integral:

clearly, these iterated integrals form a hopf algebra of rooted trees without
side branches, and the coproduct is given by the admissible cuts of the trees.
the renormalization of these integrals requires an algebra homomorphisms a on
iterated integrals, which represents a certain way of evaluation under a set of
conditions a. for our purpose we take

a(cid:16)yii

i(t)(cid:17) := yii

i(a) ,

(24)

the evaluation of the integrals at t = a. in qft, a should be regarded as an
energy scale, and a evaluates the feynman graphs at this scale.

the essential idea [16] is now to consider the convolution product of these

homomorphisms, dened via the hopf algebra structure:

(  )(h) := m  (  )  (h) ,

h  h .

(25)

the antipode axiom can be written in the compact form s id = 1 . it is however
more interesting to consider the following modication:

a,b = sa  idb := (a  s)  b .

(26)

due to the hopf algebra properties, the a,b satisfy a groupoid law. we give the
derivation in full detail, using 1) associativity of m and coassociativity of , 2)
the antipode axiom, 3) homomorphism property of , 4)   1 = 1, 5) the counit
axiom:

a,b  b,c = m (cid:16)(cid:0)m (cid:0)sa  b)  (cid:1)(cid:1) (cid:0)m (cid:0)sb  c)  (cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:17)  

= m  (m  m) (cid:16)sa  b  sb  c(cid:17)  (  )  
= m  (id  m)  (m  id  id) (cid:16)sa  b  sb  c(cid:17) 

(  id  id)  (id  )  

=1 m  (m  id)  (m  id  id) (cid:16)sa  b  sb  c(cid:17) 

(  id  id)  (  id)  

= m  ((cid:16)m  (m  id)  (sa  b  sb)  (  id)  (cid:17)  c)  
=1 m  ((cid:16)m  (id  m)  (sa  b  sb)  (id  )  (cid:17)  c)

= m  ((cid:16)m  {sa (cid:16)m  (b  b)  (id  s)  (cid:17)}  (cid:17)  c)  
=2,3 m  ((cid:16)m  {sa (cid:16)b  1(cid:17)}  (cid:17)  c)  
=4 m  ((cid:16)m  (sa  id)  (id  1)  (cid:17)  c)

=1,4 m  (id  m)  (sa  c  c)  (id  1  id)  (id  )  
=3 m  (sa  c)  (id (cid:0)m  (1  id)  (cid:1))  
=5 m  (sa  c)  
= a,c .

we apply now the a,b operation to the divergent integrals to compute

a,b(i(t)) = i

a,b:

1

a,b = m  (a  b)  (s  id)  ()

= m  (a  b) (cid:0)    1 + 1  )
= 1(a) + 1(b) = z a

p1+

.

b

the result 1
a,b is nite for   0 and vanishes for a = b. we proceed with the
next integral, using the denition of  as given by the admissible cuts and s as
given by all cuts (with sign from the number of elementary cuts) of the graphs:

2

a,b = m  (a  b)  (s  id)  (cid:16) 
(cid:17)
= m  (a  b) (cid:16)s(cid:16) 
= m  (a  b) (cid:16) 
= 2(a) + 1(a)1(a)  1(b)1(a) + 2(b)

(cid:17)  1 + s()   + 1

again, the result is nite. note that in    the root which stands for the p1
integration is the right vertex and hence is evaluated at t = b. the computation
for 3

a,b is left as an exercise.

from the identity a,b  b,c = a,c and the coproduct rule given by admissible

cuts of a tree without side branches we get chens lemma [19]:

the purpose of these considerations was the renormalization of a qft. let
us assume a theory where all contributions to the coupling constant come from
the following ladder diagrams:



hhh


= 
hhh
= 0

+ 
pppppp

+ . . .

formally, this series evaluates to innity, but this innity can be renormalized to
a nite but undetermined value. that value has to be adapted to experiment and
yields a normalization condition. at some energy scale a we are allowed to x
the coupling constant a = 0(a). but suppose we measure now the value of the
coupling constant at another energy scale b. the normalization condition is xed
so that in the diagrams we have to use in all vertices the normalized coupling
constant 
hh = a. since the renormalization removing the innities was scale
dependent, the loop diagrams i now give a contribution, and this contribution
is precisely i

a,b. hence,

b = a + 1

a,b + 2

a,b + 3

a,b + . . .

(28)

assuming the series converges, we get a nite shift of the coupling constant. in
realistic quantum eld theories, the agreement of this value with experiment is
overwhelming.
in particular, in rst order we recover the familiar logarithmic
energy dependence of the coupling constant. we also learn from (28) that one
can completely avoid talking about innities.

as it is clear from our model, the running coupling constants resulting from
renormalization are governed by the hopf algebra structure together with the
convolution product. the hopf algebra structure not only produces the combi-
natorics of the forest formula, it also allows to compare dierent renormalization
schemes, which arise from each other by a nite re-normalization. the theory is
consistent without a preferred scale or preferred renormalization scheme. they
are always related by the convolution identity a,c = ab  bc, where a, b, c stand
for parameterizations of dierent renormalization schemes. applications of these
ideas to qft calculations are starting [18].
