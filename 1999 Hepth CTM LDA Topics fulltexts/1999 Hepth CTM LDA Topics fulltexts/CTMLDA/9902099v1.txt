the superstring is quantized in a manner which manifestly preserves a u(5) subgroup

of the (wick-rotated) ten-dimensional super-poincare invariance. this description of the

superstring contains critical n=2 worldsheet superconformal invariance and is a natural

covariantization of the u(4)-invariant light-cone green-schwarz description.

1. introduction

although the uncompactied superstring is invariant under so(9,1) super-poincare

transformations, there is no quantizable formalism for the superstring where all of these

invariances can be made manifest.

in the conventional ramond-neveu-schwarz (rns)

formalism, the bosonic so(9,1) poincare invariances can be made manifest for computa-

tions involving external neveu-schwarz states. for computations involving external ra-

mond states, the necessity of bosonizing the ten  elds breaks the so(9,1) invariance to

u(5) (after wick-rotating from so(9,1) to so(10)). furthermore, none of the spacetime-

supersymmetries are manifest in the rns formalism.

in the light-cone green-schwarz formalism for the superstring, only a u(4) subgroup

of the super-poincare invariances can be made manifest. although this u(4) subgroup

includes some spacetime supersymmetries, the light-cone green-schwarz formalism is com-

pletely gauge-xed (i.e. has no worldsheet conformal or superconformal invariances) which

leads to technical diculties when computing scattering amplitudes. there also exists a

classical covariant version of the green-schwarz formalism which has manifest so(9,1)

super-poincare invariance, but it has not yet been quantized in a manner suitable for

dening physical states or computing scattering amplitudes.

over the last ve years, a new formalism for the superstring has been developed

which is a hybrid between the rns and green-schwarz formalisms.

it contains some

manifest spacetime-supersymmetries, and is related to the conventional rns formalism by

a redenition of the worldsheet variables. the formalism contains critical n=2 worldsheet

superconformal invariance, and amplitudes can be computed using standard n=2 string

methods or using n=4 topological string methods.

in previous papers, it was shown

how to perform a eld-redenition from rns variables to green-schwarz-like variables

which preserves manifest so(3,1) super-poincare invariance[1] or manifest so(5, 1) super-

poincare invariance [2]. in both these cases, four of the sixteen spacetime supersymmetries

are manifest.

in this paper, it will be shown how to perform a eld-redenition of the rns world-

sheet variables which manifestly preserves six of the sixteen spacetime-supersymmetries.

after wick-rotating to so(10), this formalism contains manifest u(5) super-poincare

invariance.

(before wick-rotating, there is a corresponding non-compact subgroup of

so(9,1) containing 25 bosonic generators and 6 fermionic generators which is manifest.)

so this formalism contains the same manifest bosonic symmetries as the rns formalism

1

in the presence of ramond states, but it also contains six manifest spacetime supersym-

metries. furthermore, one can dene the physical state conditions in a manner which is

manifestly invariant under these symmetries.

it is interesting to note that the u(5) transformations (or their minkowski counter-
part) preserve up to rescaling a pure spinor, i.e. a bosonic complex spinor ua satisfying
uam
abub = 0 for m = 0 to 9. pure spinors have been suggested by other authors to
play a useful role in describing d = 10 super-yang-mills and supergravity in harmonic

superspace[3].

2. review of spacetime supersymmetry in the rns formalism

as shown in [4][5], the n = 1 description of the rns superstring can be embedded

into a critical n = 2 string by dening the twisted c = 2 n = 2 superconformal generators

as:

g+ = mxm + c(

1
2

xmxm +

1
2

mm 

3
2

 

1
2

  bc)  2b + 2c + (c),

t = trn s ,

(2.1)

g = b,

j = cb + ,

where trn s = tm + tg is the c = 0 stress-tensor of the original rns matter and ghost

elds, and the [, ] super-reparameterization ghosts have been bosonized [6] as [ =
e,  = e]. note that the zero mode of g+ is the n = 1 brst operator and j is

related to the usual ghost current jghost = cb   by j = jghost  jpicture where jpicture

is the picture-current dened as jpicture =  + .

it was shown in [5] that n = 2 scattering amplitudes computed using n = 2 vertex

operators reproduce the usual n = 1 scattering amplitudes computed using rns vertex

operators. the advantage of treating the rns superstring as an n = 2 string theory is

that the n = 2 generators, unlike the original n = 1 generators, have no square-root cuts

with the spacetime-supersymmetry generators.

in the  1

2 picture, the spacetime-supersymmetry generator of the rns superstring is

[6]

 = i e 1
qa

2 sa

2

(2.2)

i

where sa = e
bosonizing m as 2a2  i2a1 = ei a

2 ( 1... 5)

is the sixteen-component weyl spin-eld constructed by

for a = 1 to 5. the index a will sometimes

be denoted using u(5) notation as      where the ve choices of  correspond to

the ve choices of  in the denition of sa. a describes a weyl spinor when there are an

odd number of +s and an anti-weyl spinor when there are an even number of +s. in the

above bosonization formula, we have wick-rotated the spacetime-signature to euclidean

space so that  a are real chiral bosons satisfying the ope  a(y) b(z)  log(y  z).

the algebra generated by the qa

s is

{qa

, qb

} = ab

m i em

(2.3)

using the opes of the chiral bosons  and  a where ab

m is the symmetric 16  16

pauli matrix in ten dimensions. (2.3) is related to the standard supersymmetry algebra

{qa, qb} = ab

m p m by picture-changing since h {q, }em = h xm is the momentum
operator p m where {q, } = emxm + ... is the picture-changing operator. but if one

wants the supersymmetry algebra to close o-shell, one cannot use picture-changing since

the o-shell states are not independent of the location of the picture-changing operator.

one can also dene the spacetime-supersymmetry generators in the + 1

2 picture as

qa
+ = {q, }qa

 = i (e

3

2 bsa + e

1

2 xmab
m

s

b)

(2.4)

where s b is an anti-weyl spin-eld. although {qa

+, qb

} = ab

m h xm without picture-

changing, this has twice as many supersymmetry generators as desired, so it is not the

n = 1 d = 10 supersymmetry algebra. (it is also not the n = 2 d = 10 supersymmetry

algebra since {qa

, qb

} does not vanish.) so one needs to nd a subset of the qa

s and qb

+ s

which generates at least a subset of the n = 1 d = 10 supersymmetry algebra without

using picture-changing.

in previous papers, it was shown how to do this and preserve manifest so(3, 1) super-

poincare invariance [1] or manifest so(5, 1) super-poincare invariance [2].

it will now

be shown how to choose a subset of the supersymmetry generators which preserves u(5)

invariance (after wick rotation).

3

3. u(5)-invariant description of the superstring

consider the ve spacetime-supersymmetry generators dened by

qa = i e 1

2 sa

(3.1)

where sa contains one + sign and four  signs in its exponential. these ve generators

rotate into each other under the su (5)  u (1) subgroup of so(10) rotations which rotate
x2a2 + ix2a1 into each other. (there is a minkowski-space version of this subgroup, but

it is non-compact and has no standard name.) for later convenience, we shall dene

x a = x2a2 + ix2a1,

x a = x2a2  ix2a1,

(3.2)

which satisfy the ope x a(y) xb(z)  2ab log |y  z| and which transform respectively
as a (5, 1) and (5, 1) under the su (5)  u (1) subgroup.

note that {qa, qb} = 0, so it trivially generates the correct supersymmetry algebra

without having to resort to picture-changing. one can still introduce one more spacetime-

supersymmetry generator without spoiling this property. this generator will be dened in
the + 1

2 picture as

q+ = i (e

3

2 bs+++++ +

1

2  sax a)

e

1
2

(3.3)

it is

where sa is dened to contain four + signs and one  signs in its exponential.
easy to check that {q+, qa} = 1

2 h x a and {q+, q+} = 0, so one reproduces a subset of

the desired supersymmetry algebra without having to use picture-changing. so six of the

spacetime-supersymmetries can be chosen to close o-shell, and they transform covariantly

as a (5, 3/2) and (1, 5/2) under the su (5)  u (1) subgroup of lorentz transformations.

to make these supersymmetries manifest, one needs to nd a eld-redenition from

the rns worldsheet variables to green-schwarz-like variables which transform simply un-
der the spacetime-supersymmetry transformations. first, one should dene a and 
variables which satisfy {qa, b} = ab and {q+, } = 1. this can be done by dening

a = e

1

2  sa,

 = ce 3

2  s.

one then denes the conjugate momentum to these  variables as

pa = e 1

2 sa,

p+ = be

3

2 s+++++.

4

note that a and + have zero conformal weight, transform under su (5)  u (1) as (5, 3/2)
and (1, 5/2), and satisfy the free-eld opes

a(y)pb(z)  (y  z)1ab,

(y)p+(z)  (y  z)1.

in terms of these variables, the spacetime-supersymmetry generators of (3.1) and (3.3)

take the simple form

qa = i pa,

q+ = i (p+ +

1
2

ax a).

(3.4)

the original rns variables consisted of [xm, m, b, c, , ] and, besides xm, we have

dened twelve fermionic variables. so there remain two chiral bosons,  and , which need

to be dened. requiring that they have no singularity with the s or ps implies that they

are given by

 = i(bc + ),

 = bc   + 3 +

5

xa=1

2a22a1.

these chiral bosons satisfy the free-eld opes

(y)(z)  2 log(y  z),

(y)(z)  2 log(y  z)

(3.5)

and the conformal weight of eim+n is m2  m  n2  n. furthermore, eim+n transforms

under su (5)u (1) as a (1, 5n) representation. the fact that  appears without a factor of i

in exponentials implies that it is a time-like chiral boson similar to  of the rns formalism.

gso-projected rns variables get mapped under this eld-redenition to exponentials with

both m and n integer or both m and n semi-integer.

since the new variables obey free-eld opes, the worldsheet action is still quadratic

and is

s =

1

2 z d2[

1
2

x a  x a + pa a + p+  + pa a + p+ ]

(3.6)

where [a, , pa, p+] are right-moving variables dened in the same way as their left-
moving counterparts. we have not tried to write the worldsheet action for [, ] and [, ]

because of the usual problems with actions for chiral bosons. it is straightforward to write

the twisted n = 2 superconformal generators of (2.1) in terms of these new variables, and

one nds

the n = 2 constraints are manifestly spacetime-supersymmetric.

4. physical state conditions

as described in [2], physical states of the superstring can be described by u(1)-neutral

vertex operators, , which satisfy

g+
0

g+

0  = 0,    + g+

0  + g+

0



(4.1)

where g+
variables) and g+
variables, g+ = , and in terms of the green-schwarz-like variables,

0 is the zero mode of the g+ generator (which is the brst operator in rns
0 is the zero mode of the generator g+ = [er j , g]. in terms of the rns

g+ = e 1

2 (i)p+.

(4.2)

these u(1)-neutral vertex operators  can be related to the usual physical rns vertex

operators vrn s by

vrn s = g+

0  = 0;  = 0vrn s .

(4.3)

note that (4.1) and (4.3) imply that vrn s is annihilated by the brst operator and is in

the small hilbert space, i.e. it is independent of the  zero mode.

in the rns formalism, each physical state is represented innitely many times in

the brst cohomology because of picture-changing. this innite degeneracy is usually
removed by xing all bosons to be in the zero picture and all fermions to be in the  1
2

6

picture. but such a choice is not manifestly spacetime-supersymmetric since the generators
of (3.4) carry both 1

2 and  1

2 picture.

an alternative solution for removing the innite degeneracy is to require that all states

(both bosons and fermions) carry either 1 or 0 -charge, i.e. their vertex operator is pro-
portional to en where n = 1 or 0. this solution is manifestly spacetime-supersymmetric

since the generators of (3.4) carry zero  charge. it will now be shown that this solution

assigns a unique representative to each physical state. (a similar solution was used in [7]

for the superstring with manifest so(3,1) super-poincare invariance.)

physical vertex operators vrn s of the superstring must be independent of the  zero

mode, i.e. they must be annihilated by h  as well as by q. as mentioned before, there
are innitely many such vertex operators for each physical state since one can use the
picture-raising operator, z = {q, }, or picture-lowering operator, y = ce2, to move

from one such vertex operator to another one. however, for each physical state, there is
a unique vertex operator v which is annihilated by 1  z where z is the picture-raising
operator. if v is any physical vertex operator representing this state, then v is given (up

to an overall multiplicative factor) by

v = v +



xn=0

y nv +



xn=0

z nv.

(4.4)

one can similarly dene a unique u(1)-neutral vertex operator  for any physical

state. this vertex operator  is dened by

(g+

0  g+

0 )  = 0,

   + (g+

0  g+

0 ) ,

(4.5)

and can be obtained by hitting v of (4.4) with 0. in terms of the green-schwarz-like
n where n carries -charge n. it will now

(4.10)

so any physical state of the superstring is uniquely described by the elds 0 and 1,
which satisfy the equations of (4.9), and which are dened up to the gauge transformations
of (4.10). it should be noted that  = 1 + 0 does not satisfy (4.1), and therefore is
not an acceptable physical vertex operator for computing scattering amplitudes. however,
one can construct a physical vertex operator from 1 and 0 as

 = a 1

2

[()5e 1

2 (i+3) 1] + 1 + 0  a 3

2

[e 1

2 (i) 1],

(4.11)

which, using (4.9) and (4.10), can be shown to satisfy (4.11).

it will now be shown that (4.9) and (4.10) correctly describe the physical degrees of

freedom for the massless states of the open superstring. for massless states, the vertex

8

operator must have conformal weight zero and zero momentum. since it is u(1)-neutral,

the most general such vertex operator with -charge 1 or 0 is

1 = eb(xm, a, ),

0 = c(xm, a, ),

where b and c are two superelds depending on the ten xs and six s.

the equations of (4.9) imply that

bc d(2aab + c) = 0, 

1
2

(4)aab + ()5b + aac = 0

(4.12)

where  = /, a = /a + a, a = /x a, a = / x a, (4)a =
1
24 abcdebc de, and ()5 = 1
120 abcdeabc de. these equations are invariant
under the gauge transformations

b = abab  2aa,

c = ()5  

(4.13)

which come from choosing the gauge parameters of (4.10) to be

 5

2

= e 1

2 (i+5)abcdea

bc

de,

 3

2

= e 1

2 (i+3),

 1

2

= e 1

2 (i).

note that  1

2

has no contribution at the massless level.

using the gauge transformations of (4.13), one can algebraically gauge b and c into

the form

b = 2(4)aaa + ()5 + (4)aa  (5)d,

(4.14)

c = [aaa + a
24 abcdebc de and all elds on the right-hand side of (4.14) are component
where (4)a = 1
elds depending only on xm. there is still one remaining gauge parameter given by  =
()5c and  = c, which transforms the component elds of (4.14) as

bcnabc + (4)aa + ()5p ]

bab + a

aa = ac,

aa = ac,

d = 2aac.

it is straightforward to check that the equations of (4.12) imply that

d = aaa + aaa,

ad = 2bbaa,

ad = 2bbaa,

(4.15)

4abc deab = [c de],

a = 4bab,

aa = 0,

nc de = 

2
3

abc deaab,

a = 2a, p = 0.

the rst line of (4.15) implies that aa and aa can be combined into a ten-component vector
am satisfying maxwells equation m[man] = 0. the second line of (4.15) implies that
, a and  de can be combined into a sixteen-component anti-weyl spinor  a satisfying
m  b = 0. so the physical content of the massless states of the
the dirac equation mab
open superstring has been correctly described.
