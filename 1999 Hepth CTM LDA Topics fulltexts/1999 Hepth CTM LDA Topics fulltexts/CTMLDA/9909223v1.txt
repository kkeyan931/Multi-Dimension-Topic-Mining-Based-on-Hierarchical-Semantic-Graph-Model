abstract

previously we have shown that open groups whose generators are in arbitrary
involutions may be quantized within a ghost extended framework in terms of the
nilpotent bfv-brst charge operator. here we show that they may also be quantized
within an sp(2)-frame in which there are two odd anticommuting operators called
sp(2)-charges. previous results for nite open group transformations are generalized
to the sp(2)-formalism. we show that in order to dene open group transformations on
the whole ghost extended space we need sp(2)-charges in the nonminimal sector which
contains dynamical lagrange multipliers. we give an sp(2)-version of the quantum
master equation with extended sp(2)-charges and a master charge of a more involved
form, which is proposed to represent the integrability conditions of dening operators
of connection operators and which therefore should encode the generalized quantum
maurer-cartan equations for arbitrary open groups. general solutions of this master
equation are given in explicit form. a further extended sp(2)-formalism is proposed in
which the group parameters are quadrupled to a supersymmetric set and from which
all results may be derived.

introduction

open groups in which the generators are in arbitrary involutions constitute a very general
class of continuous groups. the only framework in which one may hope to treat them
systematically in quantum theory is within a ghost extended brst frame. this is be-
cause the quantum generators and their algebra may always be represented in terms of
a brst charge constructed according to the bfv-prescription [1]. the quantization is
then consistent if the corresponding brst charge operator is nilpotent, which always is
possible to achieve for nite number of degrees of freedom [2]. in two recent papers we
have developed the technique to integrate these arbitrary involutions and to construct
nite group transformations within the operator bfv-brst frame [3, 4]. the most basic
new equation we found was a quantum master equation involving an odd extended nilpo-
tent bfv-brst charge and an even master charge [3]. this master equation is naturally
dened in terms of the quantum antibrackets dened in [5, 6]. it encodes all integrability
conditions for dening operators of the quantum connections, which in turn were shown to
encode generalized maurer-cartan equations. in [4] the formalism was further developed.
in particular we found an extended framework with more ghosts from which all proper-
ties could be extracted. furthermore, we gave an explicit form of the master charge that
satises the master equation.

since it is possible to embed generators in arbitrary involutions also into two anticom-
muting nilpotent odd operators, the brst and the antibrst charges [7], there should
exist a generalization of the above results to this case. in gauge theories the brst and the
antibrst formulation has been very useful and powerful. (there is also a correspond-
ing lagrangian formulation of gauge theories which have been treated in many papers
[8].) here we shall consider an sp(2)-version in which the brst and antibrst charges
are cast into a charge with an sp(2)-index. a rst attempt to generalize the above re-
sults for open group transformations to the sp(2)-formalism was given in [9]. there we
showed that there is an sp(2)-valued connection operator whose integrability conditions
are determined by an sp(2)-valued quantum master equation in direct analogy with the
one of [3]. this master equation was also shown to encode generalized maurer-cartan
equations. however, the resulting nite group transformations were not dened on the
whole ghost extended space in this construction. in this paper we propose a new more
genuine sp(2)-version of [3] in which the open group transformations are dened on the
entire extended space. as we shall see this construction requires the sp(2)-charges to be
given in the nonminimal sector which also contains dynamical lagrange multipliers. the
results of the present paper allow us then to generalize all properties given in [4] to the
sp(2)-formalism. we give a general sp(2)-invariant solution of the master equation, and
we nd an extended sp(2)-frame from which all results may be derived.

2 brief review of previous results.

let  with grassmann parities (= 0, 1) be quantum generators of open group trans-
formations. they satisfy the commutator algebra

[, ] = ihu 

 ,

(1)

1

where u 
commutators dened by

 are operators in general. here and in the following we will only use graded

[f, g]  f g  gf (1)f g .

(2)

by means of additional ghost operators the algebra (1) may be embedded into one hermi-
tian odd operator  satisfying

[, ] = 2 = 0.

1
2

(3)

 is the bfv-brst charge [1] and this embedding is always possible to achieve for nite
number of degrees of freedom [2]. explicitly  is given by

 = c +

1
2

ccu 

 p(1) + +    ,

(4)

where c are ghost operators and p their conjugate momenta with grassmann parities
(c) = (p) =  + 1, satisfying the properties

[c, p] = ih
 ,

(c) = c, p 

 = (1)a p.

(5)

c and  have ghost number one and p ghost number minus one. the  in (4) is given
in a cp-ordered form and the dots denote terms of higher powers in c and p which are
determined by (3). notice that the hermiticity of  implies peculiar hermiticity properties
of  in general.

in [3, 4] we presented some new techniques to analyze nite open group transforma-
tions within the above brst framework. the results of this analysis showed that open
group transformations on the ghost extended space may be expressed in terms of unitary
operators of the form

u () = exp {(ih)2[, ()]},

(6)

where , () = , are group parameters. () is an hermitian odd operator with
ghost number minus one, which was required to satisfy [, (0)] = 0 which in turn yields
u (0) = 1. a natural choice is ()  p since [, p] represent the group generators
in the extended brst frame. the latter satisfy a closed algebra if the rank of the theory
is zero or one. for rank two and higher they only satisfy a closed algebra together with
p. (the rank is equal to the maximal power of p in .)

in terms of u () we may dene open group transformed operators a() by a() 

u ()au 1(). it follows that a() satises the lie equations (  /)

a()


 a()


 (ih)1[a(), y()] = 0,

where the quantum connection operator y() is given by

y()  ihu ()(cid:18)u 1()



(cid:19) .

(7)

(8)

the existence of a unitary operator u () requires y to satisfy the integrability conditions


 y


 (1) = (ih)1[y, y],

y

(9)

2

which also follow from the lie equations (7). in order to have a representation of the form
(6) the quantum connection y should from (8) be of the form

y() = (ih)1[, ()],

() =  + 1.

(10)

this was the starting point of ref.[3]. () has obviously ghost number minus one. from
(9) we found then that the operators () must satisfy the integrability conditions


 


 (1)  (ih)2(, ) +



1
2

(ih)1[, ] = 0,

(11)

where  in general is a -dependent operator with ghost number minus two and grass-
mann parity () =  + . the quantum antibracket in (11) is dened by [5] (for
their properties see [5, 6])

(f, g) 

1

2 (cid:16)[f, [, g]]  [g, [, f ]](1)(f +1)(g +1)(cid:17) .

(12)

from (11) one may then derive integrability conditions for  which in turn introduces an
operator  with ghost number minus three together with higher quantum antibrackets
when the -commutator is divided out. thus, y is replaced by a whole set of operators,
and the integrability conditions (9) for y is replaced by a whole set of integrability
conditions for these operators. these integrability conditions may be viewed as generalized
maurer-cartan equations. the explicit form of y and  are

y() = 
() = 

()(1)+ + {possible ghost dependent terms}
()p + {possible ghost dependent terms},

(0) = 

,

(13)

where 
we may choose () = 
maurer-cartan equations

() are operators in general. for lie group theories 

() are pure functions and
()p and  = 0 in which case (11) reduces to the standard



  

(1) = 



u 

(1) +++.

(14)

the crucial new discovery in [3] was that the set of integrability conditions for ,
, . . ., are encoded in a simple quantum master equation involving an extended brst
charge  and a master charge s. (this was proved to third order in .) it is

(s, s) = ih[s, ],

(15)

where the left-hand side is the antibracket (12) with  replaced by . the odd operator
 is dened by

   + (1), 2 = 0,

(16)

where  is the conjugate momentum operator to  now turned into an operator ([, ] =
ih
 ), and where , () =  + 1, are new parameters which may be viewed as su-
perpartners to . the even operator s is given by the following power expansion in


s(, )  g + () +

(17)

where g is the ghost charge operator. for further details of this construction see [3, 4].

3 previous sp(2)-version

in the sp(2)-version of the brst-theory the quantum generators  in (1) are embedded
into two odd, hermitian charge operators a where a(= 1, 2) is an sp(2)-index. a have
ghost number one and satisfy

they have the following cp-ordered form

[a, b] = {ab} = 0.

a = ca +

1
2

cbcau 

 pb(1) + +    ,

(18)

(19)

where ca ((ca) =  + 1) are sp(2)-valued ghost operators and pa their conjugate
momenta satisfying

[ca, pb] = ih

 a
b ,

(ca) = ca, p 

a = (1)apa.

(20)

the dots in (19) denote terms of higher orders in the ghost variables which are determined
by (18).

in [9] we proposed in analogy with (7) and (10) that group transformed operators a()

satisfy the sp(2)-valued lie equations

a()




b
a a()


 b

a  (ih)1[a(), y b

a()] = 0,

where the sp(2)-valued connection operators are of the form

a() = (ih)1[b, a()],
y b

(a) =  + 1.

(21)

(22)

the analysis of these connections led to the result that y  1
conventional connection operator like (8) while

2 y a

a may be viewed as a

 ()  {acy b}
t ab

c ()

(23)

are constraint operators. the unitary operator corresponding to y only acts within a
ghost restricted subset of operators a satisfying [a, t ab
 ()] = 0. in a way this is natural
since the sp(2)-formulation contains more ghost variables then the conventional brst
frame. by restricting the ghost sector we essentially reduce the sp(2)-formalism to the
standard one. anyway within this formalism we found that the integrability conditions of
y b
a led to a whole set of integrability conditions for a and higher operators ab, . . .,
which were symmetric in lower sp(2)-indices and which was shown to constitute general-
ized maurer-cartan equations. this set of equations were then shown to be encoded in
the sp(2)-valued quantum master equation (proved to third order in )

(s, s)a

 = ih[a, s],

(24)

where the sp(2)-valued quantum antibracket is dened by [5] (their properties are given
in [9, 6])

(f, g)a

 

1

2 (cid:16)[f, [a, g]]  [g, [a, f ]](1)(f +1)(g +1)(cid:17) .

(25)

the right-hand side is equal to (12) with  replaced by a. the two odd operators a
were dened by (cf (16))

a  a + ja(1),

[a, b] = 0,

(26)

where again  is the conjugate momentum to . ja are even sp(2)-valued parameters.
the even master charge s was in turn given by the following power expansion in a  ja

s(, , j)  g + jaa() +

1
4

jbja(1) ab() +

+

36

jcjbja(1) + abc() + . . . .

(27)

the parameters ja provide for the necessary sp(2)-symmetrization in the generalized
maurer-cartan equations. for further details see [9].

4 the new sp(2)-proposal

in this paper our object is to construct open group transformations within the sp(2)-
formalism which are dened on the complete extended space. we expect then that the
group transformed operators a() satisfy the lie equations (7) and that the quantum
connections y are given by (8) in terms of a unitary group element u (). a natural
generalization of (6) is the following sp(2)-invariant expression

u () = exp {(ih)2ab[b, [a, r()]]},

(28)

where r() is an even operator with ghost number minus two and such that u (0) = 1.
c , 12 = 1). we notice that commutators of
ab is the sp(2)-metric (ab = ba, abbc = a
operators of the form ab[b, [a, a]] yield operators of the same form, which means that
ab[b, [a, a]] is a natural expression for a group generator within the sp(2)-formalism.
if u () is of the form (28) then the quantum connection (8) may always be written in the
following sp(2)-invariant form

y = (ih)2 1
2

ab[b, [a, x()]],

(29)

where x has grassmann parity , the same as y.
in this way we avoid the sp(2)-
valued connections (22) considered in [9]. however, it remains to establish the existence
of quantum connections of this form. we know that y should satisfy the boundary
conditions (13). now this expression cannot be obtained from (29) for any choice of x
if a are given in the minimal sector as in (19). however, there is a nonminimal sector
involving dynamical lagrange multipliers which does allow for a solution of the form (29).
in this sector the a-operators have the form

a = ca +

+abpb +

 pb(1) + +

cbcau 

1
2
1
cau 
2

  +    ,

(30)

where , () = , are the lagrange multipliers and  their conjugate momenta
([, ] = ih
 ).  has ghost number two and  minus two. the expressions (30) are

5

both cp- and -ordered, and the higher order terms are determined by (18).
in the
nonminimal sector it is easily seen that the boundary conditions (13) for y is reproduced
by (29) with x given by

x() = 

()(1)+ + {possible ghost dependent terms}.

(31)
thus, the quantum connections y may have the sp(2)-invariant form (29) provided a
are given in the nonminimal sector with the form (30). the integrability conditions (9)
for y lead through (29) to the following integrability conditions for x


 x

x



 (1) + (ih)3 1
2

{x, x} = (ih)1[xa, a],

(32)

where the operator xa has ghost number minus three and grassmann parity (xa) =
 +  + 1, and is in general -dependent. in (32) we have introduced a new quantum
bracket dened by

{f, g}  h[f, a], ab[b, g]i .

(33)

it has similar properties to the graded commutator (2) (see appendix a). for lie group
theories we may choose x() = 
() are functions in which
case (32) with xa = 0 leads to the maurer-cartan equations (14).

()(1)+ where 

the integrability conditions for xa in (32) lead to higher operators whose integrabil-
ity conditions lead to still higher operators etc. it is obviously a nontrivial task to invent
a master equation which encodes all these operators and their integrability conditions.
however, in the next section we will propose such a master equation. to make it easier
to understand this proposal it should be helpful to view the above construction from the
sp(2)-treatment in [9].

in [9] the quantum connections y were given in terms of the sp(2)-valued connections

(22) by

y() =

1
2

y a
a() =

1
2

(ih)1[a, a()].

obviously we may reproduce the expression (29) if we choose
a() = ba(ih)1[b, x()].

(34)

(35)

we notice then that such a relation only is possible in the nonminimal sector. it is easily
seen that (35) with (30) and (31) yields

a() = 

()pa + {possible ghost dependent terms},

(36)

which are the boundary conditions imposed in [9]. if we insert the expression (35) into
the sp(2)-valued connections (22) we nd

a() = ca(ih)2[b, [c, x()]].
y b

by means of the jacobi identities and (18) we nd then that

 ()  {acy b}
t ab

c () = (ih)2[{b, [a}, x]] = 0.

(37)

(38)

this implies that the choice (35) makes the sp(2)-treatment in [9] completely uncon-
strained and equivalent to our new proposal. notice that (38) means that y b
a have only
one independent nonzero element. in fact, it implies

y 1
2 = y 2

1 = y 1

1  y 2

2 = 0  y = y 1

1 = y 2
2.

(39)

however, it is a nontrivial task to implement the constraints (35) into the master equation.

6

5 the master equation

we propose that the master equation

(s, s)a

 = ih[a, s],

(40)

encodes all integrability conditions starting with (32) for the operator x in our new
proposal (29) of the quantum connection operator y. although (40) is of the same form
as (24) used in [9] the operators a and s are here dierent from the ones used there,
which were (26) and (27). the two odd operators a we propose to have the following
new form

a  a + a(1) + bab(1),
[a, b] = {ab} = 0,

(41)

where a are the hermitian sp(2)-charges in the nonminimal sector given by (30). a,
((a) = +1), are new operators and a their conjugate momenta ([a, b] = ih
b ).
, (() = ), are new parameters. ,  and a may be viewed as a superset of
new coordinates. the even master charge s has also a new form. here we propose it to
be given by a general power expansion in a and  (cf.(27)),

 a

s(, , ) = g + aa() + () +

ba(1) ab() +

(42)

where g now is the ghost charge operator including the dynamical lagrange multipliers,
i.e.

g  

1

2(cid:18)paca  capa(1)(cid:19)  (cid:18) + (1)(cid:19).

(43)

the grassmann parities of the coecient operators in (42) are determined by the ones of
, a and that s is even. their symmetry properties are

 = (1) , ab = ba(1) ,

. . .

(44)

all determined by the -monomials the coecients are multiplied by in s. their ghost
numbers are determined by the following conditions: s is required to have total ghost
number zero and a total ghost number one. the latter requires a to have ghost
number one which implies that a has ghost number minus one which in turn requires 
to have ghost number two. one may notice that (41) and (42) essentially reduce to (26)
and (27) if we set  = 0 and a = ja. however, if we rst calculate (40) and then
take this limit then we will not get the same equations as in [9]. the expressions (41) and
(42) yield

[s, a] = iha + b[b, a] + (cid:18)ihbab + [, a](cid:19) +

since the master equation (40) may equivalently be written as

it follows from (41) that

[s, [s, a]] = ih[s, a]

[[s, a], [s, b]] = 0.

(46)

(47)

from (46) it is also straight-forward to calculate (40) order by order in a and . to
the zeroth order and to order a the master equation (40) is identically satised. up to
second order we nd the following nontrivial equations:

where in turn the quantum sp(2)-antibrackets are given by (25) with a replaced by the
nonminimal a.

let us now analyze these equations. eq.(48) determines a in terms of . when

compared to (35) it suggests that

 = 2x(1)

(53)

provided a in s may be identied with a in (22). this identication is possible since
the bc-symmetric parts of (49) agree exactly with the integrability conditions for a in
[9]. now (49) seems to imply stronger conditions on a, since the bc-antisymmetric part
of (49) is the nontrivial equation

however, we notice then rst that (51) together with (44) imply

ab =

ab(cid:18) + (1)(cid:19) +

1

2(cid:18)zab  zba(1)(cid:19),

(55)

which means that ab are completely expressed in terms of -operators with less indices.
by means of (55), (48) and (50) we nd then that (54) is identically satised. this is related
to the identical vanishing of t ab
 () in (38). thus, only the bc-symmetric parts of (49) are
nontrivial.

eq.(51) together with (44) imply

  (1) =

1
2

ba(cid:18)zab + zba(1)(cid:19),

(56)

where the right-hand side is straight-forward to calculate from (52). we nd by means of
(48) that it reduces to

  (1) =

(ih)3{, }

12

(ih)3ab[b, [a, [, ]]] 



1
3

(ih)1(cid:20)(a(1)  a(1)( +1)), a(cid:21).

(57)

these equations are identical to the integrability conditions (32) after the identications
(53) and

xa 

1

6(cid:18)a(1)  a(1) (+1) + (ih)2ab[[x, x], b](cid:19).

(58)

notice that the combination of the a-operators entering xa are not determined by
(50). eq.(57) yields through (48) the bc-symmetric parts of (49).

to conclude we have found that the master equation (40) with the ansatz (41) and
(42) for a and s yields up to second order in the new variables a and  exactly the
integrability conditions (32) of x in our basic ansatz (29) for the quantum connection
operator y. this convinces us that we will nd the integrability conditions of xa in
(58) at the third order in a and  which in turn will involve new x-operators whose
integrability conditions are obtained at the fourth order and so on exactly as we had in
[3, 4, 9].

6 formal properties of the quantum master equation

consider the operators s() and a() dened by

s()  e

i

h f se i

h f , a()  e

i

h f ae i

h f ,

where  is a real parameter and f an arbitrary even operator. obviously

and

[a(), b()] = {a()b}() = 0

(s(), s())a

() = ih[a(), s()],

9

(59)

(60)

(61)

provided s satises the original master equation (40), and provided a is given by (41).
for f = s we have in particular

s() = s, a() = a + (ih)1[a, s](1  e).

(62)

thus, the master equation is satised if we replace a by a + (ih)1[a, s] for any real
parameter .

if f in (59) satises

[a, f ] = 0,

(63)

then a() = a. in this case s() is another solution of the master equation (40) if s is
a given solution. in order for s() to have total ghost number zero like s, f must have
total ghost number zero, and in order for s() to have the same form (42) as s, f should
not depend on  and a. if we assume that f (, , ) may be expanded in powers of ,
a and  then the solutions of (63) may be written as (the proof is given in appendix
b)

f (, , ) = f (0, 0, 0) +

1
2

ab(ih)2[b, [a, (, , )]],

(64)

where  is an even operator with total ghost number minus two which does not depend
on  and a and which satises

ab[b, [a, (, , )]](cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)===0

= 0.

(65)

( has the form (b.11) in appendix b.) f (0, 0, 0) satises [a, f (0, 0, 0)] = 0. it is both
natural and consistent to impose the restriction f (0, 0, 0) = 0 in which case we nd the
following class of invariance transformations of the master equation (40)

s  s  exp(cid:26)(ih)3 1

2

ab[b, [a, ]](cid:27), (66)
which leave the =a==0 component of s invariant. this was proposed to be the
natural automorphisms of the master equation in [9]. for the corresponding innitesimal
transformations we have

ab[b, [a, ]](cid:27)s exp(cid:26)(ih)3 1

s = (ih)3[s,

we conjecture that the general solution of the master equation (40) satisfying the

boundary condition s|=a==0 = g is given by

s = exp(cid:26)(ih)3 1

where (, , ) has the same form as in (64). notice that s = g is a trivial solution of
(40). the transformations (66) act transitively on (68).

7 open group transformations within an extended sp(2)-

formalism

the invariance transformations of the quantum master equation (40) which follow from
the transformation formulas (59) together with (63) suggest that we could dene extended
group elements by (cf.[3])

u (, , )  exp {

i
h

f (, , )},

[a, f ] = 0,

[ g, f ] = 0, f (0, 0, 0) = 0, (69)

where g is the extended ghost charge

(70)

where g is given by (43).  are the conjugate momenta to  which now are turned into
operators ([, ] = ih

 ). obviously

f in (69) is according to appendix b given by (cf (64))

[ g, s] = 0,

[ g, a] = iha.

f (, , ) =

ab(ih)2[b, [a, (, , )]].

(71)

(72)

we notice that the a==0 component of (69) agrees with (28) if we make the identi-
cation r() = (, 0, 0).

by means of (69) we may dene extended group transformed operators by

a(, , ) = u (, , )au 1(, , ),

(73)

where a does not depend on , a,  and their conjugate momenta. at a==0 a
is the group transformed operators a() satisfying the lie equations (7) with the operator
connections (29). the operators a in (73) satisfy the extended lie equation

a(, , )


 a(, , )


 (ih)1[ a(, , ), y(, , )] = 0,

where

y(, , ) = ihu (, , )(cid:18)u 1(, , )
the expression (69) for u (, , ) implies that y has the form



(cid:19) .

y(, , ) = (ih)2 1

ab[b, [a, x(, , )].

(74)

(75)

(76)

from our conjecture that (68) is the general solution of the master charge s we see that
the master charge s itself is a group transformed ghost charge under the extended group
element (69) which means that it satises the lie equation

s(, , )


 s(, , )


 (ih)1[s(, , ), y(, , )] = 0.

(77)

this equation together with (76) may be used to resolve x(, , ) in terms of s (cf the
corresponding treatment in section 6 of [3]).

appendix a

properties of the new quantum bracket (33).

in (33) we introduced a new quantum bracket which in a general algebraic framework
is dened by

{f, g}q  h[f, qa], ab[qb, g]i ,

[qa, qb] = 0,

(a.1)

where f and g are any operators with grassmann parities (f )  f and (g)  g re-
spectively. qa, a = 1, 2, are two odd anticommuting operators. the commutators on the
right-hand side are graded commutators dened by (2). the new quantum bracket (a.1)
has similar properties to the graded commutator (2). its properties are

1) grassmann parity

2) antisymmetry

3) linearity

({f, g}q) = f + g.

{f, g}q = {g, f }q(1)f g .

(a.2)

(a.3)

{f + g, h}q = {f, h}q + {g, h}q,

(for f = g).

(a.4)

4) if one entry is an odd/even parameter  we have

{f, }q = 0 for any operator f.

(a.5)

5) the generalized jacobi identities

{f, {g, h}q}q(1)f h + cycle(f, g, h) =
= (cid:18)2[{f, g}q, h] + {[ f , g] + [f, g], h}q(cid:19)(1)f h + cycle(f, g, h),

where the tilde operators are dened by

f  

1
2

ab[qb.[qa, f ]].

12

(a.6)

(a.7)

6) the generalized leibniz rule

{f, gh}q  {f, g}qh  g{f, h}q(1)f g =
= ab[[f, qa], g][qb, h](1)g + ab[qb, g][[f, qa], h](1)(f +1)(g+1) =
= [f, [g, qa]ab[qb, h]] + [[f, g], qa]ab[qb, h] + [g, qa]ab[qb, [f, h]](1)f g .(a.8)

the properties 1)-4) agree exactly with the corresponding properties of the graded com-
mutator [f, g] for arbitrary operators f and g. however, the graded commutator satises
5) and 6) with zero on the right-hand sides.

the new quantum bracket (a.1) may also be expressed in terms of the quantum sp(2)-

antibrackets. we nd

{f, g}q =

1

ab(cid:18)([f, qa], g)b

q  (f, [qa, g])b

q(cid:19)+

1
4

ab[qb, [qa, [f, g]]],

(a.9)

where the antibrackets on the right-hand side are dened by (25) with b replaced by qb.

appendix b

proof of (64).

let f (, , ) be an operator which does not depend on the conjugate momenta to ,
a and , i.e. , a and . let it furthermore be expandable in powers of , a
and . we want to solve the condition (63), i.e.

to this purpose we introduce the operators

[a, f (, , )] = 0.

a  a(1) + bab(1),
a  a(1) + bba(1),

with the properties

(a) = (a) = 1,

[a, b] = [a, b] = 0.

a has total ghost charge plus one and a minus one. we have then

a = a + a,
n =  + aa + ,

[a, b] = iha

b n,
[n, a] = [n, a] = 0.

by commuting (b.1) with a and taking (b.4) into account we get

ih[n, f ] = 

1
2

[a, [f, a]].

this in turn implies

(b.1)

(b.2)

(b.3)

(b.4)

(b.5)

(ih)2[n, [n, f ]] =

1
2

[a, [b, [[f, b], a]] =

1
4

ba[a, [b, [[f, d], c]]]cd, (b.6)

13

where the last equality follows from [a, b] = 0. now

(ih)1[n, f (, , )] = (cid:18)a 

a + a 

a +  

a(cid:19)f (, , )

(b.7)

which equivalently may be written as

(ih)1[n, f (, , )] = 

d
d

f (, , )

(b.8)

where  is a real parameter. from this expression it follows that the solution of (b.6) may
be written as

+

d

f (, , ) = f (0, 0, 0) +

ba[a, [b, [[f (, , ), d], c]]]cd

(b.9)

where f (0, 0, 0) satises

[a, f (0, 0, 0)] = [a, f (0, 0, 0)] = 0.

(b.10)

eq.(b.9) is the assertion in (64). notice that  has the explicit form

(, , ) =

(ih)2z 1

where ka(, , ) are arbitrary odd operators with total ghost number minus three which
do not depend on , a and .

a similar analysis was performed within the sp(2)-version of the bv-quantization in

[10].
