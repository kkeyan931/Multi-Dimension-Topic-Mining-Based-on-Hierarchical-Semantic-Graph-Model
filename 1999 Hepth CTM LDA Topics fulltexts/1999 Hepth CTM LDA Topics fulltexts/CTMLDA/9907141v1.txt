abstract

we examine the eect of lightcone broadening induced by quantum
gravity foam in the context of theories with large extra dimensions stretch-
ing between two parallel brane worlds. we consider the propagation of photon
probes on one of the branes, including the response to graviton uctuations,
from both eld and stringtheoretical viewpoints. in the latter approach, the
dominant source of lightcone broadening may be the recoil of the dbrane,
which scales linearly with the string coupling. astrophysical constraints then
place strong restrictions on consistent string models of macroscopic extra di-
mensions. the broadening we nd in the eldtheoretical picture seems to be
close to the current sensitivity of gravitywave interferometers, and therefore
could perhaps be tested experimentally in the foreseeable future.

i. introduction

the considerable theoretical interest in the recent suggestion [1] of possible extra dimen-
sions of macroscopic (submillimetre) size stems largely from the apparent extreme diculty
of ruling such a suggestion out experimentally. it is the point of this note to examine this
suggestion from the point of view that quantum gravity might be treated as a stochastic
medium [25]. as three of us have argued in the past [6], when one considers interactions of
closedstring particle states with dbranes, the recoil of the latter may induce distortions
of the spacetime around the brane, which manifest themselves as new quantum degrees
of freedom, carrying information and giving a stochastic nature to the process. one of the

1

most important features of this approach is the induced lightcone uctuations [7], which
may be detectable as stochastic uctuations in the velocity of light propagating through this
medium.

such phenomena may also characterize conventional pointlike approaches to quantum
gravity. indeed, as previously argued in [8], one encounters lightcone uctuations when
one expands about a squeezed graviton coherent state, which arguably characterizes phys-
ically interesting models of quantumgravity foam. the application of such ideas to at
minkowskian spacetime with compactied extra dimensions was rst considered in [9, 10],
with the conclusion that the stochastic uctuations in the lightcone produce stochastic uc-
tuations in the arrival times of photons which are considerably larger than the conventional
planck scale of fourdimensional gravity. in [10], a similar calculation has been performed
in the context of the models of [1], but the calculation has been done only in the case of just
one extra dimension, which may be ruled out by macroscopic astrophysical observations [11].
in the present work, we consider the stochastic uctuations of the lightcone in a rather
dierent framework, that of two parallel 3branes separated by a distance l. the branes live
in a world with n  6 extra transverse dimensions, in the standard string theory picture.
as discussed in [1], only closedstring states (gravitons) can propagate in the bulk. the
geometry of interest is depicted in fig. 1. we initially ignore the recoil of the branes, and
only study the eect of graviton uctuations about at (3+1)dimensional spacetime on
the brane, which is assumed to have minkowskian signature (+). the issue of recoil
eects is taken up later.

it by a small distance p, reecting the quantum uncertainty in the location of the brane.

in the picture of [1], the planck scale on the branes is constrained to be the standard

we rst review briey the analysis in [8, 9], which considered gravitons in a squeezed
coherent state, relevant for discussions of quantumgravitational spacetime foam. such
gravitons induce quantum uctuations in the spacetime metric, in particular uctuations
in the lightcone, which may have observable eects t on the arrival times of photons.
consider a at background spacetime with a linearized perturbation corresponding to the
invariant metric element

ds2 = gdxdx = ( + h) dxdx = dt2  d~x2 + hdxdx.

let 2(x, x) be the squared geodesic separation for any pair of spacetime points x and
x, and let 20(x, x) denote the corresponding quantity in an unperturbed at spacetime
background. in the case of small gravitational perturbations about the at background, one
may expand  = 0 + 1 + 2 + . . ., where n denotes the nthorder term in an expansion in
the gravitational perturbation h. then, as shown in [8], the rootmeansquare deviation
from the classical propagation time t is related to h2i by:

t = ph2i  h2
0i

l

 ph2
1i

l

+ . . .

(1.2)

where l = |x x| is the distance between the source and the detector. the expression (1.2)
is gauge invariant [9]. for convenience, the transverse tracefree gauge is used, for which
h0 = hi
i = h = 0, where greek indices refer to 3 + n+ 1-dimensional spacetime and
latin indices refer to the 3+n spatial components only.

the lightcone broadening eect is computed in [9] both for a cylindrical topology (or
one periodic compactied dimension) and in the presence of a plane boundary. the situation
of most interest for us is that in which the photon travels in a direction orthogonal to the
compactied dimension, i.e., parallel to the plane boundary, since only closedstring states
(gravitons) propagate in the extra dimensions [1]). the following results were derived in [9]:

(1.3)

for the cylindrical topology, where l is the size of the compact dimension, and l  l is
the distance travelled by the photon, and in the vicinity of a plane boundary (at which the
gravitons were forced to obey neumann boundary conditions):

(1.4)

where z is the distance of the photon trajectory from the plane, for which it is assumed that

which the kaluzaklein modes resulting from the compact dimension are taken into account
in the graviton twopoint function

as follows [9]:

gijkl(x, t; x, t) = hhij(x, t) hkl(x, t)i

(1.5)

where zi label the compact dimensions and the prime on the sums indicates that the mi = 0
terms are omitted. this technique simplies considerably the calculation of the contribution
from the kaluzaklein modes for the case where the compactied dimension is periodic.

a similar computation has been performed in [10], this time concentrating on a cylin-
drical topology in more than four dimensions, i.e., with some extra compact dimensions, as
motivated by the proposal of [1]. it was found that, for a vedimensional world with one
dimension compact, the lightcone broadening is

t  tp

l
l

,

(1.6)

where tp is the planck time. note that this diers from the cylindrical case (1.3) above [9],
for which the lightcone broadening grows as the square root of l. the conclusion of [10] is
that this scaling will in general vary according to the dimensionality of the brane.

ii. fieldtheoretical contribution

here we deal with a dierent topology (see fig. 1), in which the extra dimensions do not
have periodic boundary conditions. instead, we adopt neumann boundary conditions for
the graviton eld at each brane hyperplane. therefore we do not use the image method, but
instead obtain an estimate of the induced lightcone broadening by identifying the dominant
contributions in the various discrete mode sums involved, which will be sucient for our
purposes. the lightcone broadening eect is given by (1.2), with l denoting the distance
travelled by the photon and where 1 is related to the graviton twopoint function by [9]

where the integrations are taken along the geodesic, the spatial direction of which is dened
by the spatial unit vectors n.

as already mentioned, the topology we wish to consider in evaluating 1 is that of n
extra dimensions of size l =  [1], as shown in gure 1). we compute the eect of this
topology on the arrival time of a photon travelling parallel to one of the boundaries but
separated from it by a distance z  p. this last feature is supposed to model the eect of
quantum uctuations in the position of the brane world [12]. this uncertainty is motivated
by the framework of general relativity, in which there cannot be rigid planes.

factor of ln/2 = ()1/2. following [9], the required twopoint function can be expressed
as follows:

we wish now to determine the eects of the nonzero modes in the sum above, i.e., those
which are sensitive to the presence of the other plane boundaries. note rst from (2.8) that
the eects of high modes ma  1 are (as expected) small compared to the lowest few modes
with ma = 1, 2, . . .. note also from (2.8) that, after dierentiation with respect to x and x,
there will be some terms after the integrations which will feel the presence of the ultraviolet
cuto. in this way, we will be able to make a direct connection with the relation between
the fourdimensional planck scale and the underlying tev scale of gravity [1], as shown in
(1.1). in order to obtain an estimate of the eects of the rst nonzero modes in each of
the extra dimensions, we compute only the ma = 1 terms in the sums above. the pertinent
expression is as follows:

we have neglected contributions from the function h, since they die away much more quickly
with increasing mi and will not aect our rough estimate. note that in the expression above
we have not removed the factor of ()3 from the graviton normalization, which is common
to the zeromode (2.9), this contribution, and also the vacuum contribution. in a string
theoretical picture, this scale  could pick up a dynamical signicance, and could vary with
time. as was noted in [10], time variation of  could also result from cosmological expansion.
note nally that the l dependence is very similar to that obtained in [9] for a compactied
topology, as seen in (1.3) above.

the ratio p/ can be calculated in terms of the fundamental planck scale m (4+n)

(2.16)

for n = 6, this ratio is bigger than 2  105 and grows with  as 1/3, and for   100 it
can be as large as 104. the above estimates have been made for  = 1; if the underlying
scale is signicantly higher than this, both estimates would get larger.

to gain an understanding whether the lightcone broadening eect might in principle be
measurable, we consider some specic cases. for gammaray bursters with redshifts z  1,
l  1028cm, and, using the above formulae, we estimate   1012cm, p  1017cm for
n = 6, and hence

t  1015tp,

(2.17)

in the extra dimension picture the (fundamental) planck time is very much larger than
normal, being of order 1027 seconds, so that the lightcone broadening is 1012 seconds.
this is far below the sensitivity of experiments measuring gammaray bursts [13], which is
in the millisecond region. it is easy to see that the eect is even smaller for n < 6. in the
case of gravitywave interferometers, the sensitivity of the experiments is much better [14],
namely of the order of 1018 metres. for this case we have l  103cm, and

t  102tp  1025 s,

(2.18)

which is in principle testable at current or future gravity wave interferometers, provided
there is a controlled way to distinguish this eect from conventional noise sources.

before closing this section, we would like to remark briey on the computation of [10]
concerning extra compact dimensions. due to the periodic boundary conditions imposed in
that case, there are kaluzaklein modes which are resummed using the image method. the

7

case of more than one extra dimension complicates the analysis and was not considered in
detail in [10]. for one extra dimension, the lightcone broadening eect was found to scale
linearly with the distance travelled by the photon, in contrast to our estimate (2.13). we
stress therefore that this scaling depends crucially on the boundary conditions as well as
the number of noncompact dimensions. for example, when the image method is used for
the case of a periodic fth dimension, there are four k integrals in the noncompact space,
and the eect of the discretization is incorporated with the image sum (1.5). in the case
considered above, with only neumann boundary conditions, there are three k integrations
and the sums have to be performed explicitly.

iii. noncritical string and the dbrane recoil contribution

so far we have ignored recoil of the 3brane, which is present in all realistic cases due to
the scattering with the closedstring state that propagates in the bulk. as discussed in [6]
in the case of dbrane string solitons, their recoil after interaction with a closedstring
graviton state [15] is characterized in a worldsheet context by a model deformed by pairs
of logarithmic operators [16]:

c i
  (x i),

di
  x i(x i),

i = 0, . . . , 3

(3.1)

dened on the boundary  of the string worldsheet. here x i obey neumann boundary
conditions on the string worldsheet, and denote the brane coordinates. the remaining
yi, i = 4, . . . 9 denote the transverse directions.

in the case of dparticles, examined in [6], i takes the value 0 only.

in such a case,
the operators (3.1) act as deformations of the conformal eld theory on the worldsheet:

uir nx id describes the shift of the dbrane induced by the scattering, where ui is its
recoil velocity, and yir nx ic describes quantum uctuations in the initial position yi
of the dparticle. it has been shown [12] that energymomentum is conserved during the
recoil process: ui = k1  k2, where k1(k2) is the momentum of the propagating closedstring
state before (after) the recoil, as a result of the summation over worldsheet genera. we
also note that ui = gspi, where pi is the momentum and gs is the string coupling, which
is assumed here to be weak enough to ensure that dbranes are very massive, with mass
md = 1/(sgs), where s is the string length.

discussed in [15], the deformations are given by pi g1

in the case of dpbranes, the pertinent deformations are slightly more complicated. as

the 0i component of the tensor couplings g
ii,  = 1, 2 include the collective momenta and
coordinates of the dbrane, as before, but now there are more couplings g

the bending of the dbrane under the emission of a closedstring state propagating in the
transverse direction, as seen in fig. 2.

importance for our purposes below.

since the recoil operators are relevant in a worldsheet renormalizationgroup sense,
they require dressing with a liouville eld [17] in order to restore conformal invariance,
which has been lost in the recoil process. one then makes the crucial step of identifying
the worldsheet zero mode of the liouville eld with the target time t, which is justied
in [6, 12] using the logarithmic algebra (3.2) for the case at hand. this identication leads
to the appearance of a curved spacetime background, with metric elements that generalize
straightforwardly those for dparticles, that were given in [18]:

gij = ij, g00 = 1, g0i =xi

(g2

(3.3)

where the sux 0 denotes temporal components. in the limit   0, the leadingorder terms
are the ones proportional to the g1
ii bending couplings. from now on we restrict ourselves
to these.

for simplicity, we again consider photons moving along the x direction, as in the previous

section, in which case the relevant metric perturbations are

h0x = xi

g1
iix i(x i)

9

(3.4)

to evaluate 2
1 in terms of the twopoint function of h0x, we consider the null geodesic in
the presence of the small metric perturbations (3.4). to leading order in the bending/recoil
couplings g1

ii, one has:

(3.5)

in the case of dbrane recoil/bending, the computation of the quantum average h. . .i may be
made in the liouvillestring approach described in [6, 7]. in this case, the quantum average
h. . .i is replaced by a worldsheet correlator calculated with a worldsheet action deformed
by (3.1). it is clear from (3.4) that the twopoint metric correlator appearing in (3.5) is just
the hddi worldsheet recoil twopoint function described in (3.2). the result is therefore

(3.6)

to obtain an order of magnitude estimate of the eect, we take into account the fact that,
for i = 0, the coupling g1
0i  ui is the recoil velocity of the world 3brane. viewed as a very
massive nonrelativistic string soliton, in a dual string theory with coupling gs, the three
dimensional brane world would have [6, 12] a recoil velocity ui  gse/ms, where ms is the
fundamental string scale, and e is the typical lowenergy scale of the photon propagating
on the brane.

consistent embeddings of the picture of [1] into a stringtheoretical framework have been
made in [19, 20]. there are various string theories which seem theoretically consistent with
the picture of [1]. we now argue that the recoil expected in any realistic model compatible
with general relativity in the (3 + 1 + n)-dimensional spacetime places strong restrictions
on such models. we examine two explicit cases, namely type i and type ii strings.
in
the rst case [19], d3brane congurations appear to be consistent solutions of the model,
but with the restriction that only gravitational closedstring states can propagate in the
bulk, exactly as advocated in [1]. in this case, the string coupling gs is given by the four
dimensional yangmills gauge ne structure constant at the string scale gs = 4g, so that
(3.6) yields t  g(le)/ms. since the astrophysical data on grbs and other sources are
sensitive to t  (le)/mqg with mqg  1015 gev [13], it seems that, in such a type i
scenario, ms cannot lie in the tev range as originally proposed [1].
in the case of type ii closed strings, the picture of large extra dimensions can be accom-

modated [20] provided one uses an extremely weak string coupling:

gs  1/2

g

ms
m (4)

p

(3.7)

which is of order 1014 for ms  tev.
in such a scenario there are dbrane solutions,
in particular d5 neveuschwarz branes in which two of the longitudinal dimensions (as
well as the extra transverse dimensions) are assumed to be of the string size. this implies
that the brane looks eectively threedimensional for lowenergy physics, as in the type i
string case. within our recoil framework, couplings of the form (3.7) will lead to lightcone
broadening (3.6) which depends solely on the fourdimensional planck scale,

comparing with the bounds set in [13], we see that this possibility is not excluded, but is
also not far beyond the present experimental sensitivity. we also note that, in this latter
framework, higherorder quantum phenomena, due to higher worldsheet topologies [6, 7],
are suppressed by extra powers of the (weak) string coupling gs  1014 and hence are

the astrophysical data [13] and our recoil formalism place the phenomenological restriction

eect (3.6).

iv. conclusions

we have examined in this letter lightcone broadening eects in the context of non
periodic extra dimensions between two parallel brane worlds, one of which represents the
observable universe. we have considered the phenomenon from both eld and string
theoretical viewpoints, by analysing the role of coherent graviton uctuations on the prop-
agation of photons on one brane.

in the eldtheoretical case, we have estimated that the lightcone broadening scales

with the distance l traversed by the photons as

t  l ln l.

for astrophysical sources such as gammaray bursters, the order of the eect is about 1012
seconds, which falls well below the sensitivity of observations. however, the sensitivity
of gravitywave interferometer experiments is much better, and for these experiments we
estimate a lightcone broadening of the order of 1025 seconds, which may well lie within
their sensitivity.

in the string case, we have found that the dominant contributions to the phenomenon
come from the recoil of the dbrane due to the scattering of closedstring states (gravitons)
propagating in the bulk. the recoil distorts the spacetime around the dbrane, resulting
in a meaneld eect which implies stochastic uctuations in the arrival time of photons of
energy e on the brane of order

.

such phenomena place strong restrictions on stringtheoretical models of extra dimen-
sions [19, 20], particularly type i models.
