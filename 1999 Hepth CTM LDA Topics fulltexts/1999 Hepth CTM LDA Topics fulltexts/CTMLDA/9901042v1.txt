abstract

we use equivariant k-theory to classify charges of new (possibly non-supersymmetric)

states localized on various orientifolds in type ii string theory. we also comment on

the stringy construction of new d-branes and demonstrate the discrete electric-magnetic

duality in type i brane systems with p + q = 7, as proposed by witten.

1. introduction

during the past few years, d-branes have been playing a signicant role in the study

of non-perturbative dynamics of supersymmetric string and eld theories. dirichlet p-

branes are themselves solitonic bps states charged under ramond-ramond elds [1].

in turn, susy gauge theories appear as low-energy description of parallel d-branes [2].

in numerous applications (extended) supersymmetry was an indispensable ingredient to

guarantee stability of the vacuum and to retain control in the strong coupling regime  for

a review see [3].

the study of non-supersymmetric string vacua is especially important for making a

contact with reality. some progress in this direction has been achieved by sen [4,5] who

found new states in non-bps brane systems with tachyon condensation [6]. at least

perturbatively, these states are stable because of charge conservation. for example, type

i d-particle, dual to the so(32) heterotic spinor, is the lightest state with so(32) spinor

quantum numbers [7,8]. in fact, there are topological obstructions preventing a decay of

such states.

in the systematic approach via k-theory [9], witten proposed a new way of looking
at d-brane charges 2. the basic idea that d-branes are equipped with gauge bundles

naturally leads to the identication of lower-dimensional branes with topological defects

(vortices) in the gauge bundle. because this argument is purely topological, it does not rely

on supersymmetry at all. for this reason, it not only reproduces conventional spectrum of

bps d-branes, but it also yields charges of new non-supersymmetric states. for example,

a novel non-bps eight-brane, a seven-brane and a gauge instanton with zz2 charges were
found in type i string theory [9].

in the present paper we classify charges of new (possibly non-supersymmetric) states in

type ii orientifolds by means of equivariant k-theory. the reason to consider orientifolds

rather than orbifolds is that in many cases k-theory of an orbifold does not provide more

information than the ordinary cohomology theory of its smooth resolution (we present some

arguments and examples in section 6). thus, in reduction to lower dimension, d-brane

charges follow by wrapping over all possible cycles. the statement obviously does not hold

if the singularity is frozen, i.e. if it can not be blown up. such orbifolds correspond to

the non-zero ux of the neveu-schwarz anti-symmetric tensor eld [11], which we always

assume to vanish.

2 possible interpretation of bps charges in terms of k-theory was rst considered in [10].

1

the paper is organized in such a way that the balance between physics and mathe-

matics shifts gradually from one section to another. the next section is a warm-up where

we briey review the results of [9], and prepare to study k-theory of orientifolds. then, we

study in details three types of orientifolds, as in [9]. section 3 is devoted to  orientifolds

(type (i)). depending on the choice of projection, d-brane charges localized on such ori-

entifolds take values in the real k-theory kr(x), or its symplectic analog which we call

kh(x). calculating these groups we nd a number of new d-branes with zz2 charges,
e.g. a non-bps 3-brane localized on an o+5 plane. of particular interest is type i string
theory which is an example of such orientifolds where the involution acts trivially in the
space-time. it was proposed in [9], that there is a (1) monodromy experienced by a gauge
instanton crossing an 8-brane, or by a 0-brane winding around a 7-brane. in section 4 we

justify this conjecture in two dierent ways. first, we observe berrys phase analyzing

degeneracy of the 0-7 fermion spectrum. second, a gauge-theoretic approach leads to the

spectral ow of the dirac operator. in section 5 we return to the main theme of the paper
and classify d-brane charges localized on (1)fl orientifolds. the spectrum turns out to
be the same for any dimension of an orientifold. hence, the analogy with type iia theory

can be used to deduce physical properties of the new states. even though in this paper
we will not try to present a complete analysis of (1)fl   orientifolds, this case will be
mentioned in section 6, where some orbifold models will be discussed as well. finally, we

will present our conclusions in section 7.

close to the completion of this work we received preprints [12,13] which complement
and slightly overlap discussion of (1)fl orientifolds in section 5, in particular type iia
string theory.

2. general aspects

2.1. k-theory and d-brane charges

before we proceed to the k-theory of orientifolds it is necessary to set notation and

formulate the problem. consider type iib superstring3 propagating in the space-time:

rd+1  x

3 generalization to type iia theory is straightforward, and we comment on that in the end
of each section. in later sections we also clarify the relation between d-branes in iia and iib
theories, regarding the former as (1)fl orientifold of the latter.

2

with n 9-branes and m 9-branes, the simplest setup to dene k-theory of d-brane charges
[9]. for a moment we forget about tadpole cancellation condition, and impose it later.

the nine-branes are supplemented with gauge bundles e and f respectively.

in order

to describe a d-brane, we want the conguration (e, f ) to be translationally invariant in

(d + 1) directions. in other words, (e, f ) labels a pair of bundles over x.

of course, brane  anti-brane system described above is unstable which is marked by
the presence of a tachyon t in the spectrum of open 9  9 strings. the tachyon is a map:

t : f  e

(2.1)

or put dierently, a section of e  f . therefore, such system tends to annihilate itself
unless there is some topological obstruction. the latter is measured by the k-theory group

k(x) which we are about to dene.

assuming that an arbitrary number of brane  anti-brane pairs can be created (or
annihilated) from vacuum with isomorphic bundles h and h , we come to the equivalence

relation:

(e, f )  (e  h, f  h )

(2.2)

which makes a semigroup of pairs (e, f ) an abelian group k(x) called grothendieck

group [14,15]. the additive structure of k(x) is induced by the direct sum of bundles.

to keep the discussion less abstract, it is instructive to work out a simple example

that will prove useful below. let us calculate the grothendieck group of a point k(pt).

any bundle over a point is isomorphic to the trivial bundle of certain dimension n. in this
case, the equivalence (2.2) takes the form: (n, m)  (n + k, m + k) where n, m and k are
non-negative integers representing the dimensions of bundles. therefore, the elements of
k(x) are (n, m) = n  m which constitute a group of integer numbers zz.

now, using the result k(pt) = zz, we make a few renements of the construction. first
of all, we notice that a map of x to a point induces the homomorphism : zz  k(x). since
in physical applications the dierence (nm) is xed by the tadpole cancellation condition
we should be actually interested in the cokernel of , the so-called reduced k-theory group
k(x)  coker . we also expect a d-brane to have nite tension. this condition translates
to the statement that the charges of the physical d-branes take values in the k-theory

with compact support [9]. in other words, it tells that (2.1) is an isomorphism outside a
set u  x such that the closure u is compact. physically, u represents the region in the
transverse space where the d-brane is localized. since this condition automatically implies

3

reduced k-theory, in the rest of the paper (except in section 5) we will omit tilde and use
the notation k(x) for the reduced k-theory with compact support 4. if the space-time
is at, x = r9d, then k(r9d) with compact support is isomorphic to k(s9d) by

adding a point at innity. this group is equal to zz for d-odd, and is trivial otherwise

(see e.g. [14,15]). thus, we obtain the standard spectrum of d-brane charges in type iib

string theory. when d is odd, we take s to be positive (negative) spinor representation
of so(9  d), the group of rotations in the transverse directions. then, the explicit form
of the tachyon eld corresponding to the unit d-brane charge placed at the origin of r9d
can be written in terms of gamma matrices ~: s  s+ [9]:

t (~x) = ~  ~x

(2.3)

where we omit a suitable normalization factor.

generalization of this construction to other string theories is also possible [9]. here

we state without proof that in type iia string theory d-brane charges take values in
k(x  s1), while the charges of type i d-branes are measured by ko(x). for details we
refer the reader to the original work [9]. on the other hand, the necessary mathematical

background on k-theory can be found in [14,15,17].

4 there is a nice denition of such k-theory given by g. b. segal in terms of complexes [16].

a complex is given by a sequence:

e k: 0  e 0  e 1  . . .  ek1  0

of vector bundles {ei} over x which fails to be exact over the compact support u  x. the

complex e is called acyclic if u = . then, k(x) is dened as the set of isomorphism classes

of complexes e on x modulo acyclic complexes. even though it may sound too abstract, this

denition has a clear physical interpretation. for example, an acyclic complex of length 2 repre-
sents a pair of isomorphic bundles e = f . equivalence modulo such complexes is nothing but the
equivalence relation (2.2) which allows the creation/annihilation of braneanti-brane pairs with

isomorphic bundles. therefore, at length 2, we just recover the standard denition of k(x) given

in the text. it might seem that equivalence modulo acyclic complexes of arbitrary length is stronger

than the relation (2.2). however it is not the case [16,17], and the two denitions are equivalent.
as a next step, acyclic complex e 3 is given by the exact sequence: 0  e  g  f  0. this is

nothing but the charge conservation condition for scattering of (anti-)bps states [e] + [f ]  [g]

found in terms of the ordinary cohomology [18].

4

2.2. equivariant k-theory and orientifolds

in what follows we consider space-time of the form:

rp+1  (m9p/g)

where m9p is a smooth manifold, and the discrete symmetry group g acts continuously
on m9p. being interested in the d-brane charges, we also consider vector bundles e over
x = rpd  m9p, such that the projection e  x commutes with the action of g.
the above conditions dene the category of g-equivariant bundles over g-space x [16,17].

the corresponding k-theory is called g-equivariant k-theory kg(x).

in many ways,

kg(x) is similar to the ordinary k-theory. for example, such properties of k(x) like

thom isomorphism and bott periodicity continue to hold in the equivariant case [16,17,19].

another basic theorem of equivariant k-theory tells that if g acts freely on x, then:

kg(x) = k(x/g)

(2.4)

this isomorphism will prove to be useful in calculations.

so far we have described k-theory of orbifolds [9]. however, it turns out that, com-

pared to the usual cohomology theory, for regular orbifolds it does not provide new states

(cf. section 6). for this reason we consider g accompanied by a world-sheet symmetry
action. we refer to its xed point set (a number of rp+1 planes) as orientifold p-planes,
or op-planes for short.

following the approach of [9], we address the following question: what are the charges
of stable (possibly non-bps) states localized at a singularity of m9p/g (i.e. located on
the op-plane)? to answer this question, we have to recast it explicitly in terms of vector
bundles  the language used throughout the paper. stability of a d-dimensional object just

means that it is a topological defect in the gauge bundle of 9-brane  antibrane system, i.e.
its charge takes values in the g-equivariant k-theory of x = rpd  m9p [9]. provided
that d < p, a d-brane can be constructed from p-branes placed at the xed point of m/g.
the d-brane is stable if it is the lightest state charged under p-brane gauge group [4].

the condition for such a state to be localized at a singularity translates to the assertion

that k-theory a has compact support which includes the singular point. therefore, it

has to be g-equivariant k-theory. indeed, if in the vicinity of the singularity the tachyon
is homotopic to the vacuum5, and this region is path-connected to the innity, then one

5 in other words, t : f  e is an isomorphism.

5

can deform the compact support (the core of a gauge vortex) arbitrarily far from the

singularity. therefore, the state is not localized at the singularity and is represented by
an element of kg(x) = k(xg) where g acts freely on x [16,19]. since for the most of
our applications this group is isomorphic to the usual k-theory k(x), we consider only

the states localized on the singularity.

suppose m is a vector space, and g acts on m with at most one isolated singularity
at the origin. if we dene s to be a unit sphere in m, then the smooth manifold h = s/g
(= unit sphere in x = m/g) is automatically einstein. in analogy with the ads/cft
correspondence [20], it is natural to call it a horizon, cf. [21]. according to [20], gauge

theory on p-branes placed at the singularity is dual to the supergravity compactication

on h. the counterpart of this relation in the equivariant k-theory with compact support
is given by the exact triangle for the pair (m, s):

k (h)






k 
g(m)



k 
g(m, s)

(2.5)

where : m  s is boundary homomorphism. to write the equivariant group kg(s)
we used the fact that g acts freely on s and the theorem (2.4). because the relative
k-theory k 
g(m, s) is canonically isomorphic to the k-theory with compact support,
the exact sequence (2.5) will prove to be useful in computations of the groups kg(x).
in mathematical terminology, x is a cone on h, and h = x/h is called unreduced

suspension of h [14,15].

3. orientifolds of type (i): rp+1  (m9p/  i9p)
3.1.  2 = 1: the real k-theory

now we are ready to consider the rst example: orientifolds

rp+1  (m9p/  i9p)

(3.1)

of type (i), as in [9].
in this case the generator of g = zz2 is a combination of the
involution i9p on m9p and the world-sheet parity transformation . string orientation
reversal induces an anti-linear map  : ex  e (x) on the gauge bundle. there are two
consistent orientifold projections in type iib string theory [22], corresponding to  2 = 1
and  2 = 1 respectively. in the rst case we obtain kr-theory [9], while in the second

6

case d-brane charge takes values in the group which we denote6 by kh(x) and study in
the next part of this section. there are two types of orientifolds, called o according to
their tadpole contribution. they carry 2p4 units of p-brane charge and produce so or
sp gauge groups respectively. in what follows, we will see that the choice of projection is

determined by  (whether its square is equal to plus or minus identity), so that the states

on the orientifolds are classied by kr(x) or kh(x).

let us rst consider the case  2 = 1 corresponding to the quantization of 9-branes

with so chan-paton factors. our major example in this paper will be the simplest case
m9p = r9p where new d-brane charges can be found. then, orientifolds (3.1) take the
following form:

rp+1  (r9p/  i9p)

(3.2)

it is convenient to introduce the notation rp,q for the space-time x = rq  rp with the
involution ip acting on the second factor. the convention is chosen to agree with the
notation of the corresponding linear space in [23]. we also denote:

bp,q  unit ball in rp,q
sp,q  unit sphere in rp,q

(3.3)

note, sp,q has dimension p + q  1, e.g. so,n = sn1.

in mathematical terms, the above properties dene the real category of vector bundles

over x with compact support. therefore the d-brane charge localized on the orientifold

p-plane takes values in the real k-theory [9], which we denote as:

kr9p,pd(pt)  kr(b9p,pd, s9p,pd)

(3.4)

these are the so-called (p, q) suspension groups of a point [23]; compare with the ordinary

denition krn(x, y )  kr(x  b0,n, x  s0,n  y  b0,n) = kr(n(x/y )) [14,15].

because the involution acts trivially on a single point, we nd helpful the following general

relation:

kr(xr) = ko(xr)

(3.5)

where xr is the set of xed points under the involution  [23].

6 this is in analogy with symplectic bundles, where  is multiplication by j over the eld of

quaternions ih = c  jc.

7

to calculate (3.4), we also need the following periodicity isomorphisms established by

atiyah:

kr(x) = kr8(x)

(3.6)

krp,q(x) = krp+1,q+1(x) = krpq(x)

the rst property follows from multiplication by the generator of kr8(pt), while multi-
plication by the generator of kr1,1(pt) induces the second isomorphism in (3.6). in the

special case (of our interest) when x = pt, one can independently prove the formulas (3.6)

via the periodicity of the corresponding cliord algebras, cf. section 6.

to compute kr(r9p,pd), we use the periodicity theorem (3.6) which leads to the
group kr(r0,2pd1) of the real space r0,2pd1 with a compact support where the

involution acts trivially,  (x) = x. hence, by the formula (3.5), we obtain for the d-brane

charges:

kr(r9p,pd) = ko(s2pd1)

(3.7)

modulo the bott periodicity, we list all the ko-groups of spheres in the table below [24]:

n

ko(sn)

0

zz

1

2

zz2

zz2

3

0

4

zz

5

0

6

0

7

0

now we turn to the classication of d-brane charges that follow from (3.7) for various

values of p. the p = 9 orientifold is nothing but type i unoriented string theory. apart

from the familiar d-strings, 5-branes and 32 nine-branes, the spectrum contains so(32)

d-particle discovered by sen [4,6]. the other non-bps states with zz2-valued charges 
a gauge instanton, a seven-brane and an eight-brane  were found in [9] by means of the

systematic approach via k-theory. clearly, all these results are in accordance with the

formula (3.7).

the formula (3.7) allowes us to classify stable d-brane charges localized on the o5-
plane. due to the bott periodicity, the spectrum looks very much like in type i string

theory:

zz,

zz2,

d  string;
gauge soliton;

8

(3.8)

zz2,

gauge instanton.

among type iia orientifolds, a 4-plane has the form (3.2). it was proposed in [9],

that type iia d-brane charges take values in k(x  s1) = k 1(x). because of the mod

2 periodicity, the uncertainty in the degree of suspension does not aect the answer in the

complex k-theory. however, one has to be more accurate in the real category. we claim

(and argue in the following sections) that the correct shift is given by one extra suspension,

i.e. in the real case type iia d-brane charges are measured by the group:

kr(r9p,pd  s1) = ko(s2pd)

(3.9)

thus, under the t-duality transformation (p  p  1) the dimensions of all the d-branes
it means that the only stable
are reduced by one, compared to type iib orientifolds.

objects localized on a 4-plane are d-particles and d-instantons with charges zz and zz2
respectively.

3.2.  2 = 1: symplectic bundles and periodicity

so far we considered 9-branes quantized with so chan-paton factors according to
the choice  2 = 1 of orientifold projection, 2 = 1 in the notations of [22]. gimon and
polchinski explained that in type i sting theory 2 acts as (1) on the 5  9 strings.
hence 2|5i = |5i, and 5-branes must be quantized with sp chan-paton factors. on the
other hand, t-dualizing four directions one would get an orientifold 5-plane with 5-branes
and 9-branes interchanged because t-duality along the xi direction maps  to   ixi ,
and vice versa. this implies the existence of two kinds of orientifolds o with the same
geometry (3.2), but dierent gauge groups. explanation of all these phenomena in terms

of k-theory will be the goal of the present section. as a byproduct, we nd new non-bps
3-branes and 4-branes localized on an o+5-plane.

as we have already announced, the two choices of projection  2 = 1 give rise to
kr and kh groups respectively. while the rst choice was the subject of the previous

subsection, now we focus on the properties of kh(x). first of all, if the involution acts
trivially on x, i.e. x = xr, then kh(xr) = ksp(xr). this is a symplectic analog of
the relation (3.5) in the real case. it follows that the kh-theory inherits many properties of
the ksp-theory. namely, multiplication by the generator of kh 4(pt) = ksp4(pt) = zz
induces periodicity isomorphisms:

kh 4(x) = kr(x), kr4(x) = kh(x)

(3.10)

9

using these formulas, one can always reduce calculation of kh-groups to the real k-theory.
now we return to the orientifolds (3.2) with  2 = 1, and study the spectrum of d-
brane charges measured by kh(r9p,pd) with a compact support. using the periodicity

(3.10), it is convenient to rewrite (3.5) and (3.6) for the symplectic case at hand:

kh(xr) = ksp(xr)

kh(x) = kh 8(x)

kh p,q(x) = kh p+1,q+1(x) = kh pq(x)

(3.11)

if x = pt, the case relevant to orientifold applications, these isomorphisms might
be derived independently repeating arguments in [14] for  2 = 1 or via the relation to
cliord algebras [25,26].

calculation of the groups kh(r9p,pd) is similar to the corresponding computa-

tion in the real k-theory. the periodicity isomorphism (the last line in (3.11)) yields
kh(r0,2pd1) which is isomorphic to ksp(s2pd1) in the theory with compact sup-
port. finally, using the standard periodicity theorem ksp(sn) = ko(sn+4), we obtain:

kh(r9p,pd) = ko(s2pd+3)

(3.12)

of course, this result was expected from the consecutive application of (3.10) and (3.7).

now we shall discuss the interpretation of the d-brane charges given by (3.12). for
instance, if p = 5, we get the following d-branes localized on an o+5-plane with charges:

zz,

zz2,

zz2,

5  brane;

4  brane;
3  brane.

(3.13)

it is instructive to see how the states (3.13) with d < 5 can arise from the gauge bundles
on the ve-branes placed at the singularity. choosing  2 = 1, we start with kh(r5d 
r4,0) in a ten-dimensional space-time. because of eqs. (3.11) and (3.10), this group is
isomorphic to ko(r5d) which implies orthogonal gauge bundles on 5-branes. indeed,
ko(r5d) with compact support is equivalent to the stable homotopy group 4d(o(n ))
for suciently large n . to exhibit this, one needs to compactify r5d by a point at
innity and to regard s5d as a union of two hemispheres intersecting over the equator

10

s4d. a transition function on s4d describes o(n ) vector bundles over s5d, hence the
isomorphism ko(r5d) = 4d(o(n )). because 0(o(n )) = 1(o(n )) = zz2 we again
come to the 3-brane and 4-brane with zz2 charges (3.13). similar argument can be used to
demonstrate that ve-branes at the  2 = +1 orientifold discussed earlier carry symplectic

gauge bundles, in agreement with gimon and polchinski [22]. in that case, non-trivial

homotopy groups 4(sp) = 5(sp) = zz2 account for the sp gauge soliton and instanton
(3.8).

it is important to stress here that the orientifold symmetry group {1, i} consists just
of two elements. if we rather considered a larger symmetry group, the charges of d-branes

would be classied by another equivariant k-theory. for example, dividing by the group
of four elements {1, i, , i}, one obtains a theory equivalent to k3 compactication of
type i theory [22]. d-brane charges in the latter theory take values in the group kozz2 (x)

rather than kr(x).

3.3. stringy construction

to conclude this section, we comment on the stringy construction of new non-bps
objects. non-supersymmetric states (3.8) and (3.13) localized on orientifold 5-planes o
will be our main examples.

following [9], it is natural to propose that a d-brane for d odd is a bound state of a
type iib d-brane and an anti-brane exchanged by the  action, i.e. d could be either 1,
3 or 7. if nine-branes are quantized with orthogonal chan-paton factors, it turns out that
the tachyon is removed by  projection only for d = 1, 7 [9]. on the other hand, in the
case  2 = 1, only 3  3 system is stable. this is indeed what we found in (3.8) and
(3.13).

when interpreting a d-brane with d even, one encounters the same problem as in [9].

namely, neveu-schwarz and ramond sectors of open d  p string produce odd numbers

of fermion zero-modes. consistent quantization of the corresponding cliord algebras is
obstructed by the absence of the operator (1)f that would anti-commute with fermionic
modes. to resolve the diculty, witten proposed to introduce one extra fermion zero
mode , anti-commuting with the other fermions wi. then the operator (1)f can be
dened as the product qi wi. the appearance of the zero mode  has several eects on

string dynamics. firstly, in eect there is no gso projection on the string ground state

because we have enlarged the original fock space [8,9]. secondly, the world-sheet path
integral has an extra factor 2 from the  mode in the ns sector, so that the masses of

11

all such d-branes are 2 times greater than the masses of the corresponding type iia
d-branes. furthermore, after adding  eld and making the gso projection, we obtain

chiral spinors of so(1, d + 1) in the ramond sector of d  p string. these fermions must

be real or pseudoreal to agree with the orientifold projection. it is easy to see that this
is indeed the case [27]. for example, cl1,5 = ih(4) conrms the existence of d-particle
on the o5-plane, in accordance with ksp(s5) = zz2.
in turn, an orientifold 5-plane
supplemented with an orthogonal gauge group has a zz2 charge of non-bps 4-brane (3.13).
this is in perfect agreement with the corresponding cliord algebra cl1,1 = ir(2) which is
real.

relation between fermion zero modes in the ramond sector and cliord algebras

seems to be more profound, and begs for further investigation.

4. dynamics of type i d-branes

unlike the usual d-branes, new non-supersymmetric branes with zz2 charges found
above do not couple to massless ramond-ramond elds. of particular interest is the

question about the interaction of such states in type i string theory. the interaction

amplitudes of type i d-particle can be found using the set of rules in [8]. another (topo-

logical) sort of interaction could be the discrete electric-magnetic duality in p  q brane

systems with p + q = 7, as proposed by witten [9].

to justify the conjecture of [9], in this section we demonstrate the (1) monodromy

in two aharonov-bohm experiments:

(a) when we parallel transport a d-particle around a 7-brane;

(b) when we parallel transport a gauge instanton across an 8-brane.

we expect the interaction to be mediated by p  q strings and to be topological in

the sense that it should not depend on small perturbations, but must feel the relative

orientation of the brane system. the last eect can be felt only by fermions that become

massless when the branes come close to each other. in the neveu-schwarz sector, the p 
q string zero point energy equals  1
2 + (dn + nd)/8 > 0 [28]. therefore, we have to focus
on the fermions in the ramond sector where the ground state energy is always zero.

below we study the fermions in the ramond sector of p  q string by two dierent

methods. first, we present stringy approach where the monodromy appears as a berrys

phase, and 0  7 system is the most convenient example to use. on the other hand, case

(b) is the main example of the second approach via gauge bundles.

12

4.1. 0  7 strings and berrys phase

in order to observe the berrys phase in the 0  7 system, we establish the degeneracy

of fermion energies in the ramond sector when the branes coincide. then we show that

the degeneracy is lifted once the d-particle moves away from the 7-brane. we place the
7-brane at x8 = x9 = 0 and choose the position of the d-particle to be x = (0, . . . 0, ~a),
 > 0, where ~a is the position vector in the 8  9 plane. for the time being we put ~a = 0.
type i seven-brane is a bound state of a type iib 7-brane and an anti-7-brane where

the tachyon is projected out by  [9]. therefore, type i 0  7 string spectrum contains
two copies of modes, corresponding to a 0  7 string and a 0  7 string in type iib theory.

because these are oriented strings, the fermions are complex. in what follows we will count

real fermions, i.e. we will distinguish between 0-7 strings and 7-0 strings, the fermions of
the last two being real. in total we obtain 0  7, 7  0, 0  7 and 7  0 strings. the
world-sheet orientation reversal  maps type iib 7-branes to 7-branes, and vice versa.

therefore, only two sets of the modes listed above are independent:  identies 0  7 with
7  0 strings, and 0  7 with 7  0. let us consider 0  7 and 0  7 independent string

sectors.

taking into account the extra fermion eld , there are four fermion zero modes in the
ramond sector of the 0  7 sting7: w0, w8, w9 and . fixing the light-cone gauge in the
8  9 directions, we end up with two real fermions [29]. it is convenient to combine them
into the creation and annihilation operators d = 1
2 (w0  ) which generate two ramond
1
2i

ground states [28]:

and | 

1
2i

| +

(4.1)

these eigenstates represent two irreducible representations of the two-dimensional
rotation symmetry group so(2) with eigenvalues s =  1
2 respectively. the gso projection
keeps only one of them, the one with even fermion number. assuming d|  1
2i = 0, we
end up with the only fermion zero mode |  1
2i in the ramond sector of the 0  7 string.
the discussion of the 0  7 sector is very similar, and we still get two fermion zero modes
(4.1). but this time, since 7  7 and 7  7 vertex operators undergo the opposite gso
projections, consistent ope of 0  7  7 string triangle requires the gso projection in
the 0  7 sector to be opposite to that in the 0  7 sector [30]. hence now we end up
with the zero mode of opposite chirality, | + 1
2i. to summarize our results, in the system
7 discussion of the 0  7 sector requires only minor modications which we will make later.

13

of coinciding 0-brane and 7-brane we have found two fermion zero modes with quantum

numbers as in (4.1).

now we argue that the two-fold degeneracy found above is lifted if we perturb the
system by small displacement of the d-particle, ~a 6= 0. because prior to the gauge x-
ing fermion zero modes w0, w8, w9 and  were in the same representation of the four-
dimensional cliord algebra cl1,3, we can choose the so(2) symmetry group in the pre-
vious paragraph to be the rotation symmetry in the 8  9 plane. furthermore, physical

states (4.1) must satisfy the super-virasoro constraint:

g0|i = 0

(4.2)

which, on the ground states, reduces to the two-dimensional dirac equation pw|i 
/d = 0. because the states (4.1) have opposite so(2) chirality, they have dierent eigen-
values. it means that degeneracy is lifted as long as ~a 6= 0, i.e. when 0  7 string has nite
length.

after all, we have the two-level system with parameter space {~a}, such that levels
cross 8 at the single point ~a = 0. this is sucient information to deduce the berrys phase

acquired by the ground state during adiabatic transport of ~a around the origin [31]. to

the rst order in perturbation, the general hamiltonian describing the two levels (4.1) in

the real representation of so(2) can be expressed in terms of real pauli matrices:

1

h(~a) =

a9

2 (cid:18) a8

a9 a8(cid:19) =

1
2

~  ~a

(4.3)

note, the same hamiltonian describes 3d spin with s = 1
2 in the external magnetic eld
(a8, 0, a9), and the so-called dynamical jahn-teller eect. it is important to stress here

that because of the reality condition the berrys phase is actually a discrete number (0
or ) rather than a continuous phase. and the eigenfunction of the pure state |si can
change the sign via mixing with the orthogonal state during the adiabatic transport, e.g.:

1
2

| +

()i = cos(


2

)| +

1
2i + sin(


2

)| 

1
2i

this is an eigenfunction of the hamiltonian (4.3) where ~a = (a cos , a sin ). analogous

pattern takes place in the dynamical jahn-teller eect. the topological phase is given

8 we assume that perturbation of energy levels is rst order in ~a. direct calculation in the end

of this subsection will conrm this assumption.

14

by half the solid angle that the adiabatic path subtends at the degeneracy point, i.e.
 = 1

2 (2) = . this leads to the expected monodromy exp(i) = 1.
in order to see how the hamiltonian (4.3) follows from string dynamics, it is convenient

to consider string coordinates (i = {8, 9}):

x (z, z) = x (z) + x (z) = i

a
2

ln(

z
z

) + oscillators

in the t-dual picture [28]:

x (z, z) = x (z)  x (z) = ip ln(zz) + oscillators

where p = a/(2). therefore, small perturbation of the dirac equation (4.2) leads
to the eective hamiltonian (4.3) in the representation w8 = x, w9 = z. it follows that
energy gap between two states (4.1) is proportional to a which conrms our assumption

about conical crossing of energy levels at the origin.

4.2. approach via gauge theory

now we turn to another face of the p  q strings where the branes are represented by

topological defects in the gauge bundles on 9-branes. this approach is reminiscent of the

k-theory construction (2.3). since tadpole cancellation requires 32 nine-branes to present

in type i string theory from the very beginning [22], we dont need to invoke extra anti-
branes to construct the p  q system. following this reasoning, we study n = 1 eective
so(32) gauge theory on the world-volume of parallel 9-branes:

trz (

1
2

f f  + i [/d, ])

(4.4)

where  is the weyl fermion, and f is the eld strength of the gauge eld. in general,
the background of p- and q-branes system (q = 7  p) is given by:

a = (cid:18) a(p)


0

 (cid:19)
0
a(q)

(4.5)

and vanishing fermion eld. the gauge connection a(p)
 describing the p-brane depends on
(9  p) coordinates xi transverse to the p-brane. this is in accordance with the fact that
the corresponding bundle e(p) (together with the trivial bundle of rank 0) represents the
non-trivial element of ko(r9p).

15

in this language, the fermions in the ramond sector of p  q strings are represented

by the o-diagonal blocks  and  of the fermion eld [32]:

(4.6)

(cid:18) 0

the weyl fermion  is a section of e(p)  e 
(q).



0 (cid:19)

now it is convenient to focus on the p = 8 (q = 1) system. we are interested in
the zero modes of  when the gauge instanton and the 8-brane are placed at the same
point x9 = 0. an advantage of 8-branes is that rank of the bundle e(8) is equal to
1, i.e. we dont have to worry about the corresponding indexes. hence, according to

the index theorem [33,34], in the sector with non-trivial instanton numbers, the dirac
operator /d(a(1))  /d(a(8)) has one zero mode of denite chirality with respect to the
operators (q9
=0 ) and 9. here it is important that we deal with orthogonal gauge
group. consider perturbation of this system by small displacement of the 8-brane: x9 
x9  a. eective action for the zero mode 0 follows from (4.4):

z 0 (9a)0

because 0 satises 90 = +0, the eigenvalue of the dirac operator

/da = /d(a(1)) + /d(a(8)) + 9a

1

is equal to +a, and changes its sign as the instanton crosses the 8-brane. hence, fermion
contribution to the amplitude (det i/da)
values, also changes the sign. the other choice of the disconnected component of the
orthogonal group, corresponding to the opposite sign in 91 = 1, would result in the
fermion mode 1 which always remains massive in the neighborhood of a  0. therefore,
it would not aect the path integral, as well as other massive modes.

2 , dened as the product of the half of the eigen-

like in the approach via berrys phase, the (1) monodromy is produced by the
fermions which become massless when the branes coincide. actually the two methods are

equivalent and are based on the spectral ow of the dirac operator.

in general, using the thom isomorphism, it is convenient to reduce the problem to

two dimensions. then, a 7-brane and a (-1)-brane become a gauge instanton, while a

0-brane and an 8-brane transform into a two-dimensional soliton. the world-line of the
gauge soliton is one-dimensional curve, say x1 = a. we want to demonstrate that the sign

16

of the instanton amplitude is reversed in crossing the curve x1 = a. even though this
system is very similar to the (1)  8 case discussed above, we use a dierent argument to
show that odd number of eigenvalues of the dirac operator /da change sign. as usual, to
nd the spectral ow uder deformation from /d to /d+, one has to promote a to the
independent coordinate, d = /da +aa. then, the spectral ow of /da is equal to the index
of d [35]. now, to complete the proof, we show that ind(d) represents a non-trivial element
in k-theory9. since a(0) depends only on (x1  a), the contribution from the a direction
is the same (up to relative sign) as the contribution from the gauge soliton. therefore, we
end up with ind(/d(1)) corresponding to the gauge instanton class in ko-theory.

5. orientifolds of type (ii): rp+1  (r9p/(1)fl  i9p)

now we consider type iib orientifolds where involution is combined with the pertur-
bative symmetry group (1)fl. acting on 9-branes, it maps a pair of bundles (e, f ) to
its negative (f, e), in the sense (e, f ) = e  f . according to [9], charges of d-branes
localized at the singularity take values in the corresponding k-theory group k(r9p,pd)
that will be the main subject of this section. because calculation of k(rp,q) involves both
unreduced and reduced k-theories, notations in this section slightly dier from the rest of
the paper. namely, we restore the conventional notation k(x) for reduced cohomology of
x with the base point, while the symbol k(x) will denote unreduced k-theory.

it has been shown by m. j. hopkins that calculation of k-groups can be carried out

in terms of the usual zz2-equivariant k-theory by means of the formula [9]:

k(x) = k 1

zz2 (x  r1,0)

(5.1)

note that we always imply cohomology theory with compact support.

since the right-hand side of (5.1) represents a functor in the complex category, mul-

tiplication by the thom space of c (or c/zz2) induces the periodicity isomorphisms:

k(rp,q) = k(rp,q+2),

k(rp,q) = k(rp+2,q)

(5.2)

therefore, k(r9p,pd) depends only on parity of p and d. consider rst the case when
p is even. application of the hopkins formula (5.1) leads to the equivariant group:

k(r9p,pd) = k 1

zz2 (r10p,pd)

9 here we use equivalence of the topological and the analytical indices [33,34].

17

which, by the periodicity theorem (5.2), gives the answer for d-brane charges (p-even):

k(r9p,pd) = k 1

zz2 (r10p,pd) = k d1

zz2 (pt)

(5.3)

the last group is isomorphic to the representation ring r[zz2] if d is odd, and is trivial if
d-even [16,17]. however, p-even is not the case relevant to type iib orientifolds discussed

in [4,5].

to determine k(r9p,pd) for p-odd, we employ the exact sequence (2.5) to the pair

(b9p,pd, s9p,pd):

. . .  k n

zz2 (b9p+1,0, s9p+1,0)  k n

zz2 (b9p+1,0)  k n(s9p+1,0/zz2)  . . .

(5.4)

where we used the suspension isomorphism to substitute d by a zz2-graded index n. let us
analyze each term in the part of the sequence (5.4). the rst term is obviously isomorphic
to the k-theory k(r9p,pn) with compact support we are interested in. since b9p+1,0
is equivariantly contractable, we also get k n
zz2 (pt), the second term in
(5.4). therefore, the sequence (5.4) relates groups in question to the cohomology theory
of the horizon h = rp9p [24]:

zz2 (b9p+1,0) = k n

k n(rp9p) = (cid:26) zz  zz2r ,

0,

r = (cid:2) 9p

n odd.

2 (cid:3), n even;

careful analysis of the ring structure shows that  in (5.4) maps the generator of
kzz2 (b9p+1,0) to the generator of k n(rp9p). finally, it follows that kzz2 (r9p+1,0) =
zz and k 1

zz2 (b9p+1,0) = 0. it is convenient to list the results in the following table:

k(r9p,pd) d even d odd

p even

p odd

0

zz

r[zz2]

0

since only odd values of p are possible in type iib sring theory, d-brane charges
localized on rp+1  (r9p/(1)fl  i9p) orientifolds are classied by the second line of
the table. some states on such orientifolds have already been discussed in the literature.

for example, if p = 9, we obtain the standard spectrum of type iia string theory: even-

dimensional branes of arbitrary integer charge. notice, we obtain a direct argument that

18

d-brane charges in type iia string theory are classied by k(x), regarding it as (1)fl
orientifold of type iib theory.

recently, non-bps d-particle on such an o5-plane has also been discussed by sen
[4,5]. note, charge of the d-particle on the orientifold r6  (r4/  i4) takes value in
zz2, while charge of the d-particle that lives on the r6  (r4/(1)fl  i4) orientifold can
be arbitrary integer. actually there is no discrepancy here, because k-theory classies

charges of topologically stable objects only at weak coupling. on the contrary, s-duality

which relates the two types of orientifolds inverts string coupling constant, i.e. maps type

(i) orientifold at weak coupling to type (ii) orientifold at strong coupling. hence, spectra

of states may not be the same. below we also show that masses of the states dier by a
factor of 2.

5.1. stringy construction

using analogy with type iia string theory, it is not dicult to provide string theory

construction of the new states. in the case p = 5 this was done by bergman and gaberdiel

[36]. following the notation of [5,36], we dene type iib closed string boundary state in

the light-cone gauge:

|bd, i = exp{xn>0

1
n

[i

n i

n  i

n i

n] + ixr>0

[i

r

i
r  i

r

i
r]}|bd, i(0)

where  =  and n  zz. index r labels the fermion oscillators and runs over integers
or half-integers (r  zz + 1
2 ) depending on the sector: untwisted or twisted (u/t); ns
or r; neumann (i = 1, . . . , d + 1) or dirichlet (i = d + 2, . . . , 8) boundary conditions.
as usual, we choose ns  ns sector ground state |bd, i(0) to be odd under (1)fl and
(1)fr. therefore, ns  ns boundary state for new d-branes must have the same form
as for ordinary type ii d-branes. on the other hand, because d is even, there are no r
 r boundary states invariant under (1)fl in the untwisted sector of type iib string.
nevertheless, the closed string spectrum includes a twisted sector where the left-gso

projection is opposite, and we do get invariant r  r boundary states for d-even. it means

that the even-dimensional branes found above can be interpreted as twisted states localized

at the orientifold plane. combining the contributions of ns  ns and r  r sectors, we

obtain:

|bdi = (|u d, +insns  |u d, insns) + (|t d, +irr + |t d, irr)

19

this boundary state has precisely the same form as the boundary state of the ordinary

type iia d-brane. hence, masses of the corresponding d-branes are also equal (there is no
extra factor 2). the authors of [36] also noticed that masses of d-particles on orientifolds
of type (i) and type (ii) are dierent. here we observe that not only the masses of all

other states do not match, but also their charges are dierent. again, this conrms the

idea that we can not simply follow from weak to strong coupling.

6. miscellany

6.1. orientifolds of type (iii) and relation to cliord algebras

in the previous sections we considered type iib orientifolds where we divided either
by  or by (1)fl perturbative symmetry group. amalgamating the two cases we obtain
orientifolds of type (iii):

rp+1  (r9p/(1)fl  i9p)

(6.1)

even though we will not try to develop kr-theory of such orientifolds, a few comments

are in place here. in order to calculate groups kr(x), we need an analog of hopkins

formula (5.1) in the real category, something like:

kr(x) = krzz2 (x  r1,1)

(6.2)

validity of such formula would strongly depend on the denition of the appropriate k-

theory. for example, (6.2) would be true if we dened kr(x) as a cohomology theory

of x that ts into the following exact sequence (the way similar to how m. j. hopkins

dened k(x) group):

. . .  krzz2 (x)  kr(x)  kr(x)  . . .

(6.3)

using the ve lemma for (6.3) and the exact sequence in krzz2 -theory for the pair (x 
r1,0, x(r1,0pt)) we come to (6.2). however, (6.3) might not be the suitable denition
of kr for orientifold applications.

there is another evidence to (6.2) based on the relation between k-theory of n-
dimensional vector space x n and the corresponding cliord algebra cln [26]. in fact, in
the present paper we are mainly interested in at space-time orientifolds where x = rp,q.

for this reason, in the rest of this subsection we make a short digression on the cliord

algebras of such spaces.

20

if we dene an to be the grothendieck group of graded cln-modules modulo those

extendable to cln+1-modules10, then there exists an isomorphism [25,26,37]:

an = k(x n)

we can use this isomorphism twice, rst to convert the problem to the algebraic one, and
then to read o the answer for k(x n). in general, analysis of cliord algebras is very

simple, and many results in the previous sections become manifest once translated to the

algebraic language. for example, let us prove the periodicity isomorphism (3.6), namely

clp,q = clp4,q+4, p > 4. take an orthonormal basis of irp,q generated by matrices ,
such that11:

 +  = 2g

(6.4)

=1  ),

if  = 1 . . . 4;
otherwise.

} of clp,q generates clp4,q+4. qed.

now, we dene:

 = (q4
then, according to (6.4), the subset {


 = 

(cid:26) 

involutions on x n induce (anti-)automorphisms of the corresponding cliord algebra
cln, and the latter are classied [27]. in the orientifolds (6.1) of type (iii) the involution
maps a pair of gauge bundles (e, f ) to (f , e). since the tachyon (2.3) denes a scalar
product on the spin bundle s+  s, it suggests that the involution induces reversion au-
tomorphism of the cliord algebra clp,q. calculation of the corresponding automorphism
groups gives an independent argument to (6.2). to be specic we mention an intriguing

example of a non-bps state: a 3-brane with zz2 charge is localized on the 7-plane. however
we will not pursue the analysis any further.

6.2. ads orbifolds

in the second section we briey mentioned the ads/cft correspondence [20], which

relates the conformal gauge theory on branes placed at the orbifold singularity and su-

pergravity on the horizon manifold h. it would be interesting to investigate further im-

plications of this duality in terms of k-theoretic relation (2.5) between x and h, cf.

[21].

10 the inclusion map cln  cln+1 is induced by x n  x n  ir.
11 note, here we use the equivalence between the cliord algebra of the real space rp,q with
involution  ,  2 = +1, and the cliord algebra of the linear space irp,q with signature (p, q) [23].

21

let us consider an example of zz3 ads orbifold which is dual to n = 1 superconformal
eld theory. namely, we study type iib compactication on ads5  (s5/zz3) where the
lens space h = l2(3) = s5/zz3 is a genuine horizon in the sense of [20,21]. it is dual to
su (n )3 gauge theory on the boundary ( = the gauge theory on n parallel 3-branes placed

at the orbifold singularity) with nine chiral multiplets in the bifundamental representation

of the gauge factors [38,39]. this scft has discrete global symmetry group [40]:

(zz3  zz3) >zz3

(6.5)

where zz3 factors are generated by a, c and b such that:

a1b1ab = c

extended objects in the boundary theory which are charged under the discrete sym-

metry group (6.5) can be understood as type iib branes wrapped on various cycles in h =

s5/zz3. because the horizon h has non-trivial homology groups h1(h) = h3(h) = zz3,

we end up with even-dimensional objects propagating in ads5 with charges given by (6.5).

let us focus, say, on membranes which look like gauge strings on the boundary. there

are three types of membranes corresponding to dierent zz3 factors in (6.5)  one can

make a membrane by wrapping a 3-brane on a 1-cycle in h, and by wrapping a d5-brane

or a ns5-brane on 3-cycles respectively. the charge of the ns5-brane corresponds to the

last factor in (6.5), and accurate analysis shows that it does not commute with the other

d-brane charges. since in the present paper we deal with ordinary topological k-theory

which does not take into account the neveu-schwarz b-eld 12, we dont expect to see the

last zz3 charge factor in (6.5). indeed, calculation of the k-group of the lens space h

gives [41]:

k(h) = (zz3)2 = h even(h, zz)

complete agreement with the ordinary cohomology theory tells us that k-theory does not

supply new objects for this orbifold example.

12 note, in our discussion k (x) is always a commutative ring.

22

6.3. toric varieties

in fact, the result of the previous subsection is not very surprising. a number of space-

time manifolds x (including the models of [21]) are birationally equivalent to smooth toric

varieties. vector bundles over such x have simple combinatorial description on the dual

lattice (see e.g. [42]), and k(x) can be examined in the same way [43]. by lemma 1 of

[43], k(x) is free of torsion, that is the chern character map:

ch: k(x)  h even(x, zz)

(6.6)

is an isomorphism [44]. restriction of bundles to hypersurfaces and complete intersections

in toric varieties enlarges the range of possible applications. more generally, (6.6) holds

for cw complexes of low dimension [15].

7. summary

as we have seen, k-theory is a powerful tool which helped us to study charges of

non-bps d-branes localized on the following types of orientifolds:

(i) for the orientifolds of the form (3.1), two choices of the projection ( 2 = 1) lead
to dierent k-theories: kr(x) and kh(x) respectively. in the case of at space-time

orientifolds (3.2), we calculated these groups with the result (3.7), (3.12). for example,
we found new d-brane charges (3.8) and (3.13) localized on orientifold 5-planes o and
o+. string theory construction of the new states with zz2 charges was also discussed. in
general, odd-dimensional d-branes are represented by d  d congurations in type iib
theory, while the description of d-branes with d-even involves extra fermion zero mode

.

it would be interesting to further investigate the dynamics of such states either by

topological methods of section 4, where we proved the discrete electric-magnetic duality

in type i theory [9], or via direct computation of string amplitudes [8].

(ii) in this case, calculation of the groups k(r9p,pd), p-odd, resulted in the spec-
trum of even-dimensional d-branes with arbitrary integer charges, like in type iia theory.
these states are simply twisted states localized on (1)fl orientifolds.

(iii) our discussion of   (1)fl orientifolds is by no means complete.

in order

to calculate kr(x), we conjectured the isomorphism (6.2) and made some arguments

in favor of it. for the seven-plane example, it predicts the existence of 3-branes with

zz2-valued charge.

23

finally, we argued that k-theory of smooth (toric) compactications and their orbifold

limits does not supply new objects.

one can generalize the present analysis to other m, say tori. another aspect, which
is not quite clear yet, is the relation to cliord algebras mentioned in sections 3.3 and 6.1.
