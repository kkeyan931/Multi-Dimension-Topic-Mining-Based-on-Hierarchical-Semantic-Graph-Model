abstract

we show that the recently formulated equivalence principle (ep) implies a basic cocycle con-

dition both in euclidean and minkowski spaces, which holds in any dimension. this condition,

that in onedimension is sucient to x the schwarzian equation [6], implies a fundamental

higher dimensional mobius invariance which in turn univocally xes the quantum version of

the hamiltonjacobi equation. this holds also in the relativistic case, so that we obtain both

the timedependent schrodinger equation and the kleingordon equation in any dimension.

we then show that the ep implies that masses are related by maps induced by the coordinate

transformations connecting dierent physical systems. furthermore, we show that the minimal

coupling prescription, and therefore gauge invariance, arises quite naturally in implementing

the ep. finally, we show that there is an antisymmetric twotensor which underlies quantum

mechanics and sheds new light on the nature of the quantum hamiltonjacobi equation.

1 introduction

the consistent synthesis of the 20th century most important philosophical advances, quan-
tum mechanics (qm) and general relativity (gr), remains elusive. these two theories have

changed the human experience of reality and allowed it to probe into the smallest and largest

possible scales. yet these two pillars of modern science remain incompatible at a fundamental

level, despite enormous eorts devoted to formulating the proper mathematical theory that

will embrace both qm and gr. it also seems that none of the current approaches to quantum

gravity provides a satisfactory resolution. so, for example, the issues of the vacuum energy

and generation of mass remain unsolved. thus, it is fair to say that at present there does not

exist a proper framework for the consistent formulation of quantum gravity, and what may be

needed is a new paradigm. for example, one usually considers gr as the natural framework to

describe gravitation seen as one of the four fundamental forces. on the other hand, qm is seen

as the natural framework to describe interactions. so, the current view considers qm and gr

as playing qualitatively rather dierent roles.

our view is going in another direction. namely, suppose that qm and gr are in fact two

facets of the same medal.

if so, then we should need a reformulation of qm and a better

understanding about the nature of gr and of the other interactions. recently, in [1][6], it has

been proposed that qm can follow from an equivalence principle (ep) which is reminiscent of

the einstein ep. this principle requires that it is possible to connect all physical systems by

coordinate transformations. in particular, there should always exist a coordinate transformation

connecting a physical system with a nontrivial potential v and energy e, to the one with
v  e = 0. conversely, any allowed physical state should arise by a coordinate transformation
from the state with v  e = 0. that is, under coordinate transformations, the trivial state
should transform with an inhomogeneous term into a nontrivial one. in this context we stress

that the ep has been formulated for states composed by one particle. however, its formulation

can be suitably generalized.

the above aspects are intimately related with the concept of spacetime. actually, the

removal of the peculiar degeneration arising in the classical concepts of rest frame and time

parameterization is at the heart of the ep [6]. in [2, 6] it was shown that this univocally leads

to the quantum stationary hj equation (qshje). this is a thirdorder nonlinear dierential

equation which provides a trajectory representation of qm. after publishing [1], the authors

became aware that this equation was assumed in [7] as a starting point to formulate a trajectory

interpretation of qm (see also [8]). in [4, 6] it was shown that the trajectories depend on the

planck length through hidden variables which arise as initial conditions. so we see that qm

may in fact need gravity.

1

a property of the formulation is the manifest pq duality, which in turn is a consequence of

the involutive nature of the legendre transformation and of its recently observed relation with

secondorder linear dierential equations [9]. the role of the legendre transformation in qm

is related to the prepotential which appears in expressing the space coordinate in terms of the

wavefunction [10][11][12].

the pq duality is deeply related to the mobius symmetry underlying the ep, which in

turn xes the qshje. this is also at the basis of energy quantization [5, 6]. in particular, the
qshje is dened only if the ratio w = d/ of a pair of real linearly independent solutions of
the schrodinger equation is a local homeomorphism of the extended real line r = r{} into
itself. this is an important feature as the l2(r) condition, which in the copenhagen formulation
is a consequence of the axiomatic interpretation of the wavefunction, directly follows as a basic
theorem which only uses the geometrical glueing conditions of w at q =  as implied by the
ep. in particular, denoting by q (q+) the lowest (highest) q for which v (q)  e changes sign,
we have that [5, 6]

if

v (q)  e  


p 2
p 2

 > 0, q < q,
+ > 0, q > q+,

(1.1)

then w = d/ is a local selfhomeomorphism of r if and only if the corresponding schrodinger
equation has an l2(r) solution.

thus, since the qshje is dened if and only if w is a local selfhomeomorphism of r, this
theorem implies that energy quantization directly follows from the qshje itself. thus, we

have that basic characteristics of qm are predicted by the ep as they arise by selfconsistency

from the ep without further assumptions. this is a fundamental aspect as in the standard
formulation of qm the l2(r) condition is a consequence of the probabilistic interpretation of
the wavefunction.

an important observation is that the equivalence postulate cannot be formulated consis-
tently in classical mechanics (cm). to see this observe that if scl
(qv) denote the
classical hamiltonian characteristic function, also called reduced actions, of two classical sys-

0 (q) and scl v

0

tems, then the coordinate transformation connecting the two systems can be dened by setting

which implies qvscl v

(qv) = (qv q)qscl

0

0 (q) (w(q)  v (q)  e)

(qv) = scl

with the cshje satised by scl v

+ w v(qv) = 0,

(1.4)

we see that w v(qv) = (qv q)2w(q). this implies that the state corresponding to w = w 0  0 is
a xed a point, that is any coordinate transformation leaves w 0 invariant as w 0  (qvq)2w 0 
0. this aspect can be also understood by observing that in cm the state corresponding to w 0
has a trivial reduced action, thus the transformation is highly singular in this case. this can be

seen as the impossibility of implementing covariance of cm under the transformations dened

by (1.2). thus, in cm it is not possible to generate all nontrivial states by a coordinate trans-

formation from the trivial one. consistent implementation of the ep requires a modication

of cm. this univocally leads to qm. the starting point is to observe that the obstacle to the
implementation of the ep is the transformation property w v(qv) = (qv q)2w(q) which in turn
is a consequence of the cshje. it follows that implementation of the ep has a highly dynami-

cal content as it requires modifying the classical hj equation. therefore we should add to the

cshje a still unknown term q

1

q !2
2m   s0(q)

+ w(q) + q(q) = 0,

(1.5)

where, in the q  0 limit, s0 corresponds to the classical reduced action.

according to the ep, all physical systems composed by one particle under an external poten-
tial, labeled by the function w(q)  v (q)e, can be connected by a coordinate transformation
qa  qb = qb(qa), dened by

sb
0(qb) = sa

0 (qa).

(1.6)

observe that at this stage we have not any dynamical information. it is just the implementation

of the ep which will univocally x the term q in (1.5). furthermore, it is worth stressing that

the equivalence concerns all physical systems. in particular, note that we are not restricting the

equivalence to dierent energy levels of a system with a xed potential. the only restriction

we are considering here concerns the number of particles composing the systems. as we said,

we are considering the simplest case of systems composed by a single particle under an external

potential. nevertheless the ep can be suitably generalized to higher degrees of freedom.

it is immediate to see that the implementation of the ep has dramatic consequences. in
fact, since the state with w = w 0  0 corresponds to a xed point, we see that the only way
to implement the ep is to admit an inhomogeneous term in the transformation properties of w

w a(qa)  w b(qb) = (cid:16)qbqa(cid:17)2

w a(qa) + (qa; qb).

(1.7)

3

on the other hand, by (1.5) and (1.6) we have w b(qb) + qb(qb) = (qbqa)2[w a(qa) + qa(qa)], so
that

qa(qa)  qb(qb) = (cid:16)qbqa(cid:17)2

qa(qa)  (qa; qb).

(1.8)

we used the notation (qa; qb) to stress that the unknown term depends on the functional relation
between qa and qb. the fundamental fact is that this term is xed by the basic cocycle condition

(qa; qc) = (cid:16)qcqb(cid:17)2h(qa; qb)  (qc; qb)i ,

(1.9)

which follows as consistency condition for (1.7) or, equivalently, (1.8). actually, in one dimension

a key point was the following result [6]

the cocycle condition (1.9) uniquely denes the schwarzian derivative up to a multiplicative

constant and a coboundary term.

in particular, one obtains (qa; qb) = 2{qa, qb}/4m, where {f, q} = f /f 3(f /f )2/2 denotes
the schwarzian derivative and  is a constant with the dimension of an action. since in the
classical case the term (qa; qb) must disappear from (1.7), we have that the classical limit is
reached for   0. thus  is naturally identied with h. furthermore, one sees that the
inhomogeneous term (qa; qb) has a purely quantum origin1.

an important issue of the present formulation concerns the similarity between the postulate

equivalence of states and the einstein ep. according to the einstein ep it is always possible

to choose a locally inertial coordinate system such that the physical laws have the same form

as in unaccelerated coordinate systems in the absence of gravitation. the ep we formulated

states that it is always possible to choose a a coordinate system in such a way that the reduced

action corresponds to the one of the free particle with vanishing energy. while in the case

of the einstein ep, it is the gravitational eld which is locally balanced by a coordinate

transformation, here there is an arbitrary external potential which is globally balanced by a

coordinate transformation. another fundamental dierence concerns the framework in which

this is formulated. while the einstein ep is formulated at the level of the equation of motions,

here the formulation is implemented in the framework of hj theory. this is a quite crucial

dierence. this becomes particularly transparent if we consider the case of a timeindependent

potential. in this case we can use the reduced action so that time never appears directly in

the relevant equations. only after the qshje is solved, one introduces time parameterization
according to jacobi theorem [7], that is t  t0 = qs0. the fact that the qshje diers from
the classical version implies that the conjugate momentum qs0 does not coincide with the
mechanical one m q. thus, a feature of the ep is that time arises as parameter for trajectories

1we refer to [6] for several explicit examples of the formulation.

4

and it is not introduced a priori. we believe this is a distinctive feature of hj theory whose power

fully manifests in the present formulation of qm. the dierent role of time in the formulation

of the two equivalence principles can be also seen in considering the equation of motion of a

particle in an external gravitational eld mq = mg. performing the timedependent coordinate
transformation q = q  gt2/2, we have mq = 0, for any value of the energy e of the particle,
including the free particle at rest for which e = 0. so that, depending on the initial conditions
of mq = 0, we may have q to be constant, say q = 0. therefore, there are no selected frames
in other words, while the classical
if one uses timedependent coordinate transformations.

reduced action, which is not a function of time, is trivial, the equation of motions contain the

time parameter which continues to ow. hence, while with the cshje description it is not

always possible to connect two systems by a coordinate transformation, this is not the case if

one describes the dynamics using newtons equation. in particular, in nding the coordinate

transformation reducing the cshje description of mq = mg, one has

1

2m  scl

0 (q)

(1.10)

(qv) = scl

for which there is no coordinate transformation q  qv(q) such that scl v
0 (q) with
scl v
(qv) the reduced action of the free particle with e = 0. time parameterization can be
seen as a way to express a constant, say 0, by means of the solution of the equation of motions,
q = f (t). for example, for a particle with constant velocity, we have 0 = qvt, so that particles
position can be denoted by either q itself or vt. in this way one can always reduce to the particle
at rest by simply setting q = q  f (t). while in the case of the cshje description there is
the degenerate case cnst = mvq, corresponding to scl v
0 (q), time parameterization
provides a welldened and invertible transformation i.e. q = q  f (t)  q = q + f (t). the
reason underlying the dierences in considering the role of space and time is that xed values

(qv) = scl

0

of q and t correspond to quite dierent situations. even if the particle is at rest, say at q = 0,

time continues to ow. it is just the use of time that allows to connect dierent systems by a

coordinate transformation.

there is a common feature underlying both the eistein ep and the one we formulated.
namely, note that the existence of the classical systems with scl
0 = 0, is essentially the reason
of the impossibility of implementing covariance of cm under the transformations dened by

(1.2). to be more precise, note that eqs.(1.3) and (1.4) can be seen as a rst step in checking

covariance. however, these equations have not any particular content. the problem of covari-

ance arises when one tries to connect them by some transformation. we have seen that there
is an inconsistency if we consider the coordinate transformation scl v
0 (q). it is just
the removal of this inconsistency which allows the implementation of the ep and therefore to

(qv) = scl

0

have covariance. this univocally leads to qm. thus, similarly to gr which can be derived by

5

implementing the principle of general covariance under dieomorphisms, also qm arises from

a covariance principle. in our case covariance essentially relies on the request that the trans-
formation sv
0 (qv) = s0(q) be always dened. this immediately discards cm and modies the
classical concept of particle at rest. thus we see that, similarly to the case of gr, the ep

implies a principle of covariance.

one may wonder whether the properties of the schwarzian derivative, an intrinsically one

dimensional (possibly complex) object, extend to higher dimension. experience with string

theory and cft would indicate that similar properties are in fact strictly related to low

dimensional spaces. nevertheless, these are related to the appearance of the qshje, and so,

since the essence of qm manifests itself already in onedimension, one may in fact believe that

the higher dimensional generalization exists. we will in fact show that the basic fact underlying

the construction is that the ep implies a mobius symmetry in any dimension. more precisely,

the ep implies the higher dimensional analogue of the cocycle condition.

one of the main results of the present paper is the proof that the above condition leads,

in the case of the euclidean metric, to an invariance under ddimensional mobius transfor-

mations.

in the case of the minkowski metric the relevant invariance is with respect to the

(d+1)dimensional conformal group. this result is also nontrivial from the mathematical

point of view, and may have implications for the higher dimensional dieomorphisms. this

mobius symmetry will then univocally lead to the timedependent schrodinger equation in

higher dimension.

remarkably, we will see that the ep in fact implies also the higher dimensional relativistic

quantum hj equation (rqhje) with external potentials. furthermore, while considering an

external potential leads to a mixing between the kinetic and potential part in deriving the

rqhje, this equation is obtained quite naturally once one considers the minimal coupling

prescription. this aspect is a relevant feature of the ep which in fact corresponds to a sort

of naturalness. namely, the right framework to formulate it is the exact one, that is special

relativity. so, for example, the timedependent schrodinger equation is simply derived as the

nonrelativistic approximation from the rqhje. furthermore, as we will see in the case of

the kleingordon equation in the presence of the electromagnetic eld, the minimal coupling

prescription is in fact the natural one. this indicates that gauge theories are deeply related

to the ep. in this context, it is useful to stress that the standard schrodinger problems one

usually considers correspond to ideal situations. so for example, a potential well cannot be seen

as a fundamental interaction. actually, the schrodinger problems one may consider at the level

of fundamental interactions essentially concern the electromagnetic one. it is then interesting

that the schrodinger equation for minimal coupled potentials simply follows from the ep as a

nonrelativistic limit.

6

another key ingredient in the one dimensional derivation of qm from the ep was the

following identity involving the schwarzian derivatives

(qs0)2 =

h2
2

({e

2i

h s0, q}  {s0, q}).

(1.11)

again, in the present paper we will nd the generalization of this identity to higher dimension

and in the relativistic case.

we started the introduction by arguing for the need for a radical new paradigm for qm.

the fact that qm arises from the ep may suggest that masses have a quantum origin. we will

show that indeed this may be the case. the point is that in the relativistic case one has

w =

1
2

mc2,

(1.12)

then we have that mass of a particle is obtained from the state corresponding to w 0  0 and
is due to the inhomogeneous term which arises from coordinate transformations.

another basic feature of the present approach concerns the appearance of a new eld which

underlies qm. this is one of the new points one meets in considering the higher dimensional

generalization of our formulation. as we will see, this eld arises by solving the continuity
equation associated to the qhje. in particular, this equation denes a (d  2)form which in
turn denes an antisymmetric 2tensor.

our paper is organized as follows. in section 2 we set the notation and derive the higher

dimensional cocycle condition. in section 3 we will prove the invariance of the cocycle condition

under the ddimensional mobius transformations. in section 4 we derive the higherdimensional

schrodinger equation and discuss a possible connection with the holographic principle. in sec-

tion 5 we then discuss the generalization to the relativistic case. we show that in the case of

the minkowski metric, the cocycle condition is invariant under the (d+1)dimensional confor-

mal group. we derive the generalization of our approach for the kleingordon equation and

show how the timedependent nonrelativistic limit correctly reproduces the timedependent

schrodinger equation. in section 6 we discuss the generalization to the case with a fourvector

including covariant derivatives. we also investigate the generation of mass in our approach and

the appearance of the hidden antisymmetric tensor eld which underlies qm. finally, appen-

dices a and b are devoted to some more technical aspects of sections 3 and 5.

2 ep and cocycle condition

let us consider the case of two physical systems with hamiltons characteristic functions s0 and
sv
0 and denote the coordinates of the two systems by q and qv respectively. let us set

sv
0 (qv) = s0(q).

7

(2.1)

observe that there are no particular assumptions in making the above identication. the point
is that the physical content is in the functional dependence of sv
0 and s0 on their arguments
qv and q respectively, and (2.1) simply denes a functional relation between qv and q. one
0 (qv) and s0(q). however, as the onedimensional
may also choose another rule connecting sv
case shows [1][6], the formulation would result much more cumbersome. thus, in a certain
sense, we can say that s0 transforms as a scalar.
underlies (2.1) is that there is a functional relation between the coordinates of two arbitrary

in particular, the true assumption which

physical systems characterized by the systems themselves. this is essentially the content of the

ep we will formulate. note that the existence of a nonsingular functional relation between the

coordinate of two physical systems cannot hold for all states of cm. in fact, (2.1) does not make
sense once one considers the classical state with w = 0, corresponding to s0(q) = cnst. thus,
requiring that (2.1) is dened for all systems implies that s0(q) = cnst cannot corresponds
to a physical state. this corresponds to a criticism of the concept of rest frame in cm. it is

just the removal of the peculiar degeneration arising in the classical concepts of rest frame and

time parameterization, discussed in great detail in sect.2 of ref.[6], which provides the physical

motivation for formulating the ep.

as in the onedimensional case, we will see that the implementation of the ep, not only

excludes cm, but also uniquely leads to the quantum version of the hj equation.

note that eq.(2.1) induces, in the onedimensional case, the map

where

q  qv = v(q),

v = sv 1

0

 s0,

(2.2)

(2.3)

0

with sv 1
denoting the inverse of sv
induces the transformation s0  sv

0 . this construction is equivalent to say that the map (2.2)
0 = s0  v1, that is s0(q)  sv

0 (qv) = s0(q(qv)).

in the higher dimensional case, the relation sv

0 (qv) = s0(q) denes innitely many maps
q  qv = v(q).2 since, as we will see, the ep requires that two arbitrary physical systems can
be always connected by a coordinate transformation, the only condition we need is that there

exists the inverse of the map v. this is not sucient to x the particular form of the v(q).

however, as we will see, we only need that for any pair of states there exists a invertible map

(2.2) satisfying (2.1). we will call such maps vtransformations.

2tensorial properties are characterized by giving specic rules under given transformations of coordinates.
here we are not giving the transformation rules of s0 under a set of coordinate transformations. rather, we are
0 (qv)
dening a set of coordinate transformations starting from the knowledge of the functional structure of s v
and s0(q). for this reason, strictly speaking, even if s v
0 (qv) = s0(q), the reduced action cannot be considered a
scalar function.

8

one of the main results in [1][6] was that the reduced action s0

free system with vanishing energy3 is not a constant but the selfdual state

0 (q0) corresponding to the

2i

h s 0

0 =

e

q0 + i0
q0  i0

,

(2.4)

with 0, re 0 6= 0, a complex integration constant. this corresponds to the overlooked zero
mode of the conformal factor in the quantum analogue of the hamiltonjacobi equation [1][2][6].
furthermore, in ref.[1] the function t0(p), dened as the legendre transform of the reduced
action, was introduced

t0(p) =

d

xk=1

qkpk  s0(q),

s0(q) =

d

xk=1

pkqk  t0(p).

(2.5)

while s0(q) is the momentum generating function, its legendre dual t0(p) is the coordinate
generating function

pk =

s0
qk

,

qk =

t0
pk

.

(2.6)

let us now consider the classical stationary hamiltonjacobi equation (cshje) in d

dimensions

where

xk=1  scl

0

+ w(q) = 0,

w(q)  v (q)  e,

(2.7)

(2.8)

with v (q) the potential and e the energy. we denote by h the space of all possible ws
corresponding to physical systems composed by one particle (the extension to more general

cases will be investigated elsewhere).

in [1] the following equivalence principle has been formulated

for each pair w a,w b  h, there is a vtransformation such that

w a(q)  w av(qv) = w b(qv).

(2.9)

we will see that the implementation of the ep will univocally lead to the qshje. this implies
that there always exists the trivializing coordinate q0 for which w(q)  w 0(q0), where

3we note that a common shift of v and e by a constant does not change w  v  e. since this is the
combination in which the data v and e enter in the equation of motions, we see that the case v  e = 0 is
indistinguishable from v = e = 0.

w 0(q0) = 0.

(2.10)

9

in particular, since the inverse transformation should exist as well, it is clear that the trivializing
transformation should be locally invertible. we will also see that since classically w 0 is a xed
point, implementation of (2.9) requires that w b(qv) is given in terms of w a(q) (times a suitable
jacobian) together with an additive term. in other words, the ep immediately implies that the
w states transform inhomogeneously.

the fact that the ep cannot be consistently implemented in classical mechanics (cm) is

true in any dimension. to show this let us consider the coordinate transformation induced by

the identication

then note that the cshje

so that the ratio of momenta corresponds to the jacobian of a coordinate transformation. by

(2.12), we have

that for the w 0 state gives

w(q)  w v(qv) = (pv|p)w(q),

w 0(q0)  w v(qv) = (pv|p0)w 0(q0) = 0.

10

(2.18)

(2.19)

thus we have [1]

w states transform as quadratic dierentials under classical vmaps. it follows that w 0 is a
xed point in h. equivalently, in cm the space h cannot be reduced to a point upon factorization
by the classical vtransformations. hence, the ep (2.9) cannot be consistently implemented in

cm. this can be seen as the impossibility of implementing covariance of cm under the coordinate

transformation dened by (2.11).

it is therefore clear that in order to implement the ep we have to deform the cshje. as

we will see, this requirement will determine the equation for s0 in any dimension.

let us discuss its general form. first of all observe that adding a constant to s0 does not
change the dynamics. actually, eqs.(2.5)(2.6) are unchanged upon adding a constant to either
s0 or t0. then, the most general dierential equation s0 should satisfy has the structure

(ksv

0 (qv))2/2m + w v(qv) + qv(qv) = 0,

xk=1

which by (2.1) and (2.21) yields

w v(qv) + qv(qv) = (pv|p) [w(q) + q(q)] .

(2.22)

(2.23)

a basic guidance in deriving the dierential equation for s0 is that in some limit it should
reduce to the cshje. in [1][2] it was shown that the parameter which selects the classical phase

is the planck constant. therefore, in determining the structure of the q term we have to take

into account that in the classical limit

lim
h0

q = 0.

(2.24)

the only possibility to reach any other state w v 6= 0 starting from w 0 is that it transforms
with an inhomogeneous term. namely as w 0  w v(qv) 6= 0, it follows that for an arbitrary
w a state

w v(qv) = (pv|pa)w a(qa) + (qa; qv),

(2.25)

11

and by (2.23)

qv(qv) = (pv|pa)qa(qa)  (qa; qv).

(2.26)

let us stress that the purely quantum origin of the inhomogeneous term (qa; qv) is particu-
larly transparent once one consider the compatibility between the classical limit (2.24) and the

transformation properties of q in eq.(2.26).

the w 0 state plays a special role. actually, setting w a = w 0 in eq.(2.25) yields

w v(qv) = (q0; qv),

(2.27)

so that, according to the ep (2.9), all the states correspond to the inhomogeneous part in the
transformation of the w 0 state induced by some vmap.

let us denote by a, b, c, . . . dierent vtransformations. comparing

w b(qb) = (pb|pa)w a(qa) + (qa; qb) = (q0; qb),

with the same formula with qa and qb interchanged we have
(qb; qa) = (pa|pb)(qa; qb),

in particular

(q; q) = 0.

more generally, comparing

w b(qb) = (pb|pc)w c(qc) + (qc; qb) = (pb|pa)w a(qa) + (pb|pc)(qa; qc) + (qc; qb),

with (2.28) we obtain the basic cocycle condition

which expresses the essence of the ep.

(qa; qc) = (pc|pb)h(qa; qb)  (qc; qb)i ,

(2.28)

(2.29)

(2.30)

(2.31)

(2.32)

3 (qa; qb) and the higher dimensional mobius group

in this section, we will show that (qa; qb) vanishes identically if qa and qb are related by a
mobius transformation. this is a consequence of eqs.(2.20) and (2.32) and generalizes the one
dimensional result obtained in [1][2][6], which states that (qb; qa) = 0 if and only if qb is a linear
fractional transformation of qa

qb =

aqa + b
cqa + d

,

ad  bc 6= 0.

(3.1)

as in the one dimensional case, the mobius symmetry will x the qterm in eq.(2.21). before

going into the details of the proof, we will give a brief overview of the mobius group (see, for

example, [13]).

12

3.1 higher dimensional mobius group

let us denote by q = (q1,   , qd) an arbitrary point in rd. a similarity is the ane mapping

where b  rd and the matrix m = a is the composition of a dilatation

q  mq + b,

and a rotation

q  aq,

a  r,

q  q,

(3.2)

(3.3)

(3.4)

where   o(d). similarities are naturally extended to the compactied space rd = rd{}.
a similarity maps  to itself.

let us consider the hyperplane

p (a, t) = { q  rd|q  a = t, a  rd, t  r}.

the reection with respect to p (a, t) is given by

let us set

f (q) = q  2(cid:18)q  a  t

a  a (cid:19) a.

r2 = q2

1 +    + q2
d.

(3.5)

(3.6)

(3.7)

the last generator of the mobius group is the inversion or reection in the unit sphere sd1.
if q 6= 0

(3.8)

(3.9)

otherwise

q  q =

0  ,

  0.

the mobius group m( rd) is dened as the set of transformations generated by all similarities
together with the inversion. actually, an arbitrary mobius transformation is the composition

of a number of reections and inversions. furthermore, a mobius transformation is conformal

with respect to the euclidean metric and a theorem due to liouville states that the conformal
group and m( rd) actually coincide for d > 2.

13

3.2 translations and dilatations

we now begin to study the properties of (qb; qa) when qb and qa are related by dilatations and
translations. let us start by noticing that if b and c are arbitrary constant vectors, then from

(2.32) we have

(q + b + c; q) = (q + b + c; q + b) + (q + b; q) = (q + b + c; q + c) + (q + c; q),

(3.10)

so that

(q + b + c; q + b)  (q + b + c; q + c) = (q + c; q)  (q + b; q),

(3.11)

where (q + b)k = qk + bk, k = 1, . . . , d. we will show that the unique solution of (3.11) is

(q + b; q) = f (q + b)  f (q),

(3.12)

where f is an arbitrary function of q. pick j  [1, d] and let bj and cj be the only non
vanishing components of b and c

(3.13)

(3.14)

(3.15)

(3.16)

(3.17)

b = (0, . . . , bj, 0, . . .),

c = (0, . . . , cj, 0, . . .).

let us set

with b given by (3.13). eq.(3.11) reads

f (b, q) = (q + b; q),

f (c, q + b)  f (b, q + c) = f (c, q)  f (b, q).

taking the derivative of both sides of eq.(3.15) with respect to bj, we get

qj f (c, q + b)  bj f (b, q + c) = bj f (b, q).

by (2.30)



f (b, q) =

cn(q)bn
j .

xn=1

plugging this expression into eq.(3.16), we nd



xn=1

qj cn(q + b)c n

j 



xn=1

ncn(q + c)bn1

j = 



xn=1

ncn(q)bn1

j

.

(3.18)

furthermore, expanding cn(q + b) and cn(q + c), it follows by eq.(3.18) that

that for n = 1 reads

(m  1)!

m
qj cn(q) =

m

n
qj cm(q),

1

m
qj c1(q) = qj cm(q).

14

(3.19)

(3.20)

it follows that

qj f (b, q) =

qj cn(q)bn

j =



xn=1

1
n!



xn=1

n
qj c1(q)bn

j = c1(q + b)  c1(q),

(3.21)

which upon integration on qj yields

f (b, q) = c(q + b)  c(q) + g(b, q),

(3.22)

with q denoting all the variables other than qj. moreover, by (2.30) g(0, q) = 0. let us show
that g(b, q) is identically vanishing. by (2.32)

f (b + c, q) = (q + b + c; q) = (q + b + c; q + b) + (q + b; q) = f (c, q + b) + f (b, q), (3.23)

that by (3.22) implies

g(b + c, q) = g(b, q) + g(c, q),

(3.24)

that is g(b, q) = g(0, q)bj. however, by (3.17)(3.21) and (3.22)

bj f (b, q) = qj c(q + b) + g(0, q) = c1(q + b) + g(0, q) =

ncn(q)bn1

j

.

(3.25)



xn=1

then, setting bj = 0, we nd from the last equality that g(0, q) = 0. finally, we are left with

f (b, q) = c(q + b)  c(q).

(3.26)

from this equation it is then possible to derive eq.(3.12). the technical detailes are reported

in appendix a. related reasonings, reported in appendix a, show that

where now

(aq; q) = a2f (aq)  f (q),

f (0) = 0,

(3.27)

(3.28)

with f the same function appearing in eq.(3.12)

3.3 rotations

let us consider (q; q), where   o(d). first of all, if qb = qa, we see that (pb|pa) = 1,
because t = t = 1d. hence, by (2.32)

((q + b); q + b) = (q + b; q + b) = (q + b; q) + (q; q + b) =

(q + b; q) + (q; q) + (q; q + b),

(3.29)

15

which implies

((q + b); q + b)  (q; q) = f ((q + b))  f (q) + f (q)  f (q + b).

(3.30)

therefore, (q; q) = f (q) f (q) + c. however, since (q; q) evaluated at q = 0 cannot depend
on , we have (q; q)q=0 = (q; q)q=0 = (q; q) = 0. then

(q; q) = f (q)  f (q).

(3.31)

3.4

inversion

let us consider the inversion q(q) (3.8). the jacobian matrix of this mapping is given by

then

which implies

(q; q) = (p|p)(q; q) =

which implies that (q; q) vanishes when evaluated at any q0 solution of q = q, that is

from this one derives the following result

(q; q)|q=q0 = 0.

(q; q) =

3.5 fixing the coboundary

let us denote by (q) a mobius transformation of q. by (3.12)(3.27)(3.31) and (3.41) we have

((q); q) = (p|p)f ((q))  f (q).

(3.42)

given a function f (q), we have that if (f (q); q) satises the cocycle condition (2.32), then this

is still satised under the substitution

(f (q); q)  (f (q); q) + (p|pf )g(f (q))  g(q),

(3.43)

where g has to satisfy the condition g(0) = 0. this condition is a consequence of the fact

that (aq; q) evaluated at q = 0 is independent of a, so that it vanishes at q = 0. therefore,
if (aq; q) satises (2.32), then also (aq; q) + a2g(aq)  g(q) should vanish at q = 0, implying
that g(0)(a2  1) = 0, that is g(0) = 0. the term (p|pf )g(f (q))  g(q) can be seen as a
coboundary term. we now show how the coboundary ambiguity (3.43) is xed. first of all

observe that (2.1) implies

s0
0 (q0) = s0(q),

(3.44)

0 denotes the reduced action associated to the w 0  0 state. on the other hand, by

where s0
(2.27) we have that the equation of motion for s0(q) we are looking for is

(q0; q) = w(q).

(3.45)

comparing (3.45) with (2.20) and (3.44) we see that a necessary condition to satisfy (2.20) is
that (q0; q) depends only on the rst and higher derivatives of q0. in fact, by (3.44) we have
1  s0(q), that is q0 is a functional of s0. therefore, a possible dependence of (q0; q)
q0 = s0
on q0 itself, would imply that (3.45) has the form f (s0,s0, s0, . . .) = 0 rather than (2.20).
therefore, the only possibility is that the function f in (3.42) be vanishing

0

f = 0.

(3.46)

therefore, we arrived at the following basic result

eq.(2.20) and the cocycle condition (2.32) imply that (qa; qb) vanishes when qa and qb are related
by a mobius transformation, that is

(q + b; q) = 0,

(aq; q) = 0,

(q; q) = 0,

17

(3.47)

(3.48)

(3.49)

(q; q) = 0.

the above equations are equivalent to ((q); q) = 0. furthermore, by (2.32) we have

((qa); qb) = (qa; qb),

(qa; (qb)) = (p(b)|pb)(qa; qb).

(3.50)

(3.51)

let us consider the jacobian factor (p(b)|pb). first of all observe that the mobius transformation
is conformal with respect to the euclidean metric. namely, we have

ds2 =

d

xj=1

d(q)jd(q)j =

d

xj,k,l=1

(q)j

(q)j

qk

ql

dqkdql =

d

xj=1

e (q)dqjdqj.

(3.52)

therefore

(p(b)|pb) = e (qb).

(3.53)

in particular, the absence of assumptions in setting sv

note that in the case of translations and rotations the conformal rescaling is the identity. for
dilatations exp a = a2, whereas for the inversion exp  = r4.
note that the above conformal structure arises by setting sv

0 (qv) = s0(q). let us make clear
0 (qv) = s0(q) would
that this is not an assumption. any transformation we choose other than sv
0 (qv) = s0(q)
yield the same results.
results from the fact that q and qv represent the spatial coordinates in their own systems. so,
0 (qv) = s0(q) can be seen just as the simplest way to set the coordinate transformations from
sv
the system with reduced action sv
0 (since physics is determined by the functional structure of
sv
0 , we can denote the coordinate as we like) to the one with reduced action s0. nevertheless,
there is a hidden apparently innocuous assumption: that the position sv
0 (qv) = s0(q) actually
makes sense. this is not the case in cm, as for the free particle of vanishing energy we have
s0(q) = cnst.
welldened for any system is essentially the same as imposing the ep. however, on the one

in this case the above position does not make sense. requiring that this is

hand we have seen that the existence of the transformation implies the conformal structure, on

the other we will see that the ep, and therefore existence of the transformation, implies qm.
thus, we have that the mobius group, that for d  3 coincides with the conformal group, is
intimately related to qm itself.

4 the schrodinger equation

in this section, we will derive the quantum hamiltonjacobi equation in d dimensions and then

show that the latter is equivalent to the stationary schrodinger equation.

let us start with the quantum stationary hj equation (qshje) in one dimension

+ v (q)  e +

h2
4m{s0, q} = 0.

(4.1)

this equation was univocally derived from the ep in [1][2]. after publishing [1], the authors

became aware that this equation was assumed in [7] as a starting point to formulate a trajectory

interpretation of qm. in particular, floyd [7] introduced the concept of trajectories by using

jacobis theorem according to which

t  t0 =

s0
e

,

(4.2)

from which one sees that the conjugate momentum p = qs0 does not in general correspond to
the mechanical one, that is p 6= m q. this is a basic dierence with respect to bohms theory
s0 does not work in
[14][18]. furthermore, floyd noted that bohms assumption  = re
this case [7]. apparently one may infer that (4.1) is equivalent to the standard version of the

(4.6)
so that s0 would satisfy the same equation as s0. nevertheless, there is a problem in the above
derivation. namely, in bohms assumption, like in the usual formulation of quantum hj theory,
s0, but
s0. thus, suppose that the wavefunction describes a bound
between the wavefunction and re
state so that it must be proportional to a real function.4 according to bohm and the usual
approach, this would imply5

the identication is not between a general solution of the schrodinger equation and re

s0 is a constant f or bound states.

this in turn implies rather peculiar properties. for example, quantum mechanically the con-

jugate momentum is vanishing for bound states. this seems to be an unsatisfactory feature of

s0 with the wavefunction. in general re

(4.3)(4.4). to be more precise, eqs.(4.3)(4.4) are good equations unless one forces the identi-

4this is a consequence of reality of w as this implies that if  solves the schrodinger equation, then this
is the case also of . if  6 , then      = cnst 6= 0, so that  is never vanishing. in particular, if
  l2(r), then    (see also sections 14 and 17 of ref.[6]).

5to be precise, bound states would correspond to s0 = cnst outside the nodes of the wavefunction.

expression for the wavefunction is

|a| = |b|.

(4.7)

(4.8)

i

thus for s0 there is no trace of the condition s0 = cnst one has for bound states setting
s0. let us note that whereas s0 = cnst would be consistent in the case of classically
 = re
forbidden regions, as there scl
0 = cnst,6 problems arise in regions which are not classically
forbidden, i.e. where scl
0 6= cnst. for example, in the case of the harmonic oscillator, one has
s0 = cnst q  r, which follows by identifying r exp(i s0/h) with the wavefunction, while in
some region one has scl
0 6= cnst. as a consequence, while quantum mechanically the particle
would be at rest, after taking the h  0 limit, the particle should start moving. we refer to
hollands book [15] for an interesting analysis concerning the classical limit of the harmonic

oscillator in bohmian theory.

the above analysis can be summarized by the following basic fact

if s0 is the quantum analogue of the reduced action, and therefore reduces to the classical one
in the h  0 limit, then the wavefunction cannot be generally identied with r exp(i s0/h). in
particular, this cannot be the case for bound states, such as the harmonic oscillator, in which

the wavefunction is proportional to a real function also in regions which are not classically

forbidden.

however, we have seen that if r exp(i s0/h) is not identied with real solutions of the
schrodinger equation, then we have equivalence between (4.1) and (4.3)(4.4). we also note
that with the formulation (4.1) one directly sees that the situation s0 = cnst can never occur.
in fact, one has rather stringent conditions connected with the existence of {s0, q}, which in
turn reects the basic nature of the cocycle condition and therefore of the ep. in this respect
we recall that existence of {s0, q} implies that the ratio of two real linearly independent solu-
tions of the schrodinger equation must be a local selfhomeomorphism of the extended real line
r = r  {}. this is a basic fact as it implies energy quantization without any assumption
[5][6].

6note also that having s0 = cnst in the classically forbidden regions would imply a trivial trajectory, since

p = 0 there.

20

4.1 hidden variables, planck length and holographic principle

the above remarks are related to the proposal of changing the bohmian denition of mechanical

momentum m q [18]. this proposal is related to the fact that (4.3)(4.4) allow a rearrangement
of s0 and r. on the other hand, these symmetries are particularly evident working directly
with eq.(4.1), which in turn is equivalent to the schwarzian equation

in fact these symmetries correspond to the invariance of (4.9) under mobius transformations of

ne

2i

h s0, qo =

(4.9)

eq.(4.1) implies that s0 can be expressed in the canonical form [1][2][6]

(4.10)

which is equivalent to the one considered by floyd [7]. here  = {, }, where   r and
1 = re  6= 0, 2 = im  are integration constants, and w = d/  r, where d and  are
real linearly independent solutions of the stationary schrodinger equation

"

2

q2 + v (q)#  = e.

(4.11)

observe that the condition 1 6= 0 is equivalent to having s0 6= cnst which is a necessary
condition to dene {s0, q} in the qshje.

a basic feature of (4.10) is that it explicitly shows the existence of mobius states [1][6],

called microstates by floyd [7]. in particular, the constants 1 and 2 correspond, together with
, to the initial conditions of eq.(4.1). these initial conditions do not appear in the schrodinger
equation, so that 1 and 2 can be seen as a sort of hidden variables. their role is quite basic.
in particular, it has been shown in [4][6] that in order to have a welldened classical limit, 

should depend on fundamental lengths which in turn should depend on h. this dependence
arises in considering the e  0 and h  0 limits. in particular, let us consider the conjugate
momentum in the case of the free particle with energy e
h(e + e)

pe = 

2|k1 sin kq  ie cos kq|2 ,

where k = 2me/h. the rst condition is that in the h  0 limit the conjugate momentum

reduces to the classical one

lim
h0

2me.

pe = 

on the other hand, we should also have

lim
e0

pe = p0 = 

h(0 + 0)
2|q  i0|2 .

21

(4.12)

(4.13)

(4.14)

eqs.(4.12)(4.13) show that, due to the factor h in cos kq, the quantity e should depend on

e. let us set

e = k1f (e, h) + e,

(4.15)

where, since e is still arbitrary, we can choose the dimensionless function f to be real. by
(4.12) we have

pe = 

2mef (e, h) + me(e + e)/h
|eikq + (f (e, h)  1 + ek) cos kq|2 .

note that if one ignores e and sets e = 0, then by (4.13)

(4.16)

(4.17)

lim
h0

f (e, h) = 1.

we now consider the properties that e and f should have in order that (4.17) be satised in
the physical case in which e is arbitrary but for the condition re e 6= 0, as required by the
existence of the qshje. first of all note that cancellation of the divergent term e1/2 in

yields

pe



e0 

2h2(2me)1/2f (e, h) + h(e + e)
2|q  ih(2me)1/2f (e, h)  ie|2 ,

lim
e0

e1/2f (e, h) = 0,

(4.18)

(4.19)

so that k must enter in the expression of f (e, h). since f is a dimensionless constant, we

need at least one more constant with the dimension of length. two fundamental lengths one

can consider are the compton length c = h/mc, and the planck length p = qhg/c3. two

dimensionless quantities depending on e are

and

xc = kc = s 2e
mc2 ,

xp = kp = s 2meg

hc3

.

(4.20)

(4.21)

on the other hand, since xc does not depend on h it cannot be used to satisfy (4.17), so that it
is natural to consider f as a function of xp. let us set

f (e, h) = e(x1
p ),

(4.22)

p ) = pk1 kxk

where (x1
coecients k. in order to consider the structure of e, we note that although e(x1
the e1/2 divergent term, we still have some conditions to be satised. to see this note that

p0 = 0.

p0 = 

h(0 + 0)
2|q0  i0|2 ,

we have that the eect on p0 of a shift of im 0 is equivalent to a shift of the coordinate.
therefore, in considering (4.27) we can set im 0 = 0 and distinguish the cases q0 6= 0 and
q0 = 0. note that as we always have re 0 6= 0, it follows that the denominator in the right
hand side of (4.28) is never vanishing. let us dene  by

(4.31)

a constant length having powers of h can be constructed by means of c and p. we also note
that a constant length which is independent of h is provided by e = e2/mc2 where e is the
electric charge. thus 0 can be considered as a suitable function of c, p and e satisfying the
constraint (4.31).

the above investigation indicates that a natural way to express e is given by

e = e(xp)0,

(4.32)

where (xp) = pk1 kxk

(4.26). for example, for the modulus e built with (xp) = 1xp, one should have 1 > 0.

we stress that the appearance of the planck length is strictly related to pq duality and
to the existence of the legendre transformation of s0 for any state. this pq duality has
a counterpart in the d duality [1][6] which sets a length scale that already appears in
considering linear combinations of d0
= q0 and 0 = 1. this aspect is related to the fact that
we always have s0 6= cnst and s0 6 q + cnst, so that also for the states w 0 and w = e one
has a nonconstant conjugate momentum. in particular, the planck length naturally emerges
in considering lime0 pe = p0, together with the analysis of the h  0 limit of both pe and
p0. as a result the compton length and e appear as well.

we also note that in [2][6] it has been shown that the wavefunction remains invariant under

suitable transformations of  and . these transformations constitute the basic symmetry group

of the wavefunction. to see this we consider the case of the wavefunction e corresponding
to a state of energy e. since e solves the schrodinger equation, for any xed set of integration
constants  and , there are coecients a and b such that

e{} =

1

0{} (cid:16)ae i
qs

h s0{} + be

i

h s0{}(cid:17) .

(4.35)

performing a transformation of the moduli    = {, }, we have (we refer to [2][6] for
notation)

e{} =  

2i

hqs0!1/2

ha d + bb + (ac + ba)s0i .

requiring that e{} remains unchanged up to some multiplicative constant c, that is

we have by (4.36)

e{}  e{} = ce{},

a2b + aba = aba + b2b.

(4.36)

(4.37)

(4.38)

this denes the symmetry group of the wavefunction. thus, we have seen that there are hidden

variables depending on the planck length and that these can be suitably changed without any

eect on the wavefunction. therefore, we can say that there is a sort of information loss in

24

considering the wavefunction. so, the probabilistic interpretation of the wavefunction seems

due to our ignorance about planck scale physics.

the above analysis can be summarized as follows

1. qm follows from the ep[1][6]. the formulation is strictly related to pq duality, which

in turn is a consequence of the involutive nature of the legendre transformation.

in

this context qm is described in terms of trajectories where, according to floyd [7], time

parameterization is dened by jacobis theorem.

2. the theory shows the existence of mobius states [1][6], called microstates by floyd [7].

these states cannot be seen in the framework of ordinary qm. in particular, these states

appear in the context of the quantum hj equation whose initial conditions depend on the

planck length [4][6]. furthermore, from the symmetries of the wavefunction under change

of hidden variables, we explicitly see that there are equivalence classes of the moduli 

which correspond to the same wavefunction [2][6].

3. the role of pq duality is a fundamental one. in fact, this reects in the appearance in the

formulation of a pair of real linearly independent solutions of the schrodinger equation.
so there is a d duality [1][6] which reects the basic mobius symmetry and therefore
the existence of mobius states. this directly shows that in considering solutions of the
basic schrodinger equation 2
q 0 = 0, one has to introduce a length to consider linear
combinations of d0
= q0 and 0 = 1. since in this case w  v  e = 0, the schrodinger
problem does not provide any scale, so that we are forced to introduce a universal length.

4. implementation of the ep implies that the trivializing map, expressed as the mobius trans-
form of d/, must be a local selfhomeomorphism of r [1][6]. this in turn implies that
for suitable ws the corresponding schrodinger equation must admit an l2(r) solution
[5][6]. this implies that the ep itself implies energy quantization. so basic facts of qm,

such as tunnelling and energy quantization, are derived without axiomatic assumptions

concerning the interpretation of the wavefunction. furthermore, the appearance of the
l2(r) condition shows that the hilbert space structure starts emerging.

the above shortly summarizes some of the main aspects of the theory. in this context we

note that the appearance of planck length in hidden variables has been recently advocated by

t hooft [19]. t hooft argues that such hidden variables must play a role in the implementation

of the holographic principle [20]. in t hoofts paper it is also argued that due to information

loss, planck scale degrees of freedom must be combined into equivalence classes. the presence

25

of equivalence classes moduli , corresponding to symmetries of the wavefunction, seems to be
a possible framework for t hoofts proposal7.

4.2 the higher dimensional case

let us now consider the problem of nding the equation for s0 in the higher dimensional case.
to this end, let us rst consider a potential of the form

so that

(4.43)

(4.44)

(4.45)

note that by (2.25)(2.26)(3.47) and (3.49), both w(q) and q(q) are invariant under rotations
and translations8

w(q) = w(q(q)),

q(q) = q(q(q)),

q = q + b.

(4.46)

however, observe that

q(q) = q(q(q)) =

xk=1{ s0(q), qk}.

(4.47)

7we observe that in an interesting paper, floyd has recently considered related issues [21].
8it is worth stressing that these transformations are not a symmetry of the physical system as in general the
functional structures change, that is w(x) 6= w(x), q(x) 6= q(x). thus, eq.(4.46) should not be confused with
true symmetries, e.g. invariance of the potential under rotations, expressed as w(q) = w(q).

26

this means that expressing q(q) in terms of sums of schwarzian derivatives does not provide a

convenient, i.e. covariant, formulation. in the following, we will express the quantum potential

q, and consequently the qshje in a way that makes this invariance manifest. first of all, note

that any qk can be written as

qk(qk) = 

h2
2m

krk

rk

,

k(r2

kks0,k(qk)) = 0.

(4.48)

in fact, as we have seen above, since the implementation of the ep implies that s0 is never a
constant, we have (4.6). therefore, we have

(4.55)

let us now consider an arbitrary state, not necessarily corresponding to a w of the kind
(4.40), with some reduced action s0. we consider r solution of (4.52). note that, as (4.51)
is independent of the form of w, we have that (4.53) holds for arbitrary s0 and r satisfying
(4.52). we now start showing that (4.55) holds in general, not only in the case (4.40).

(4.56)

(4.57)

we have seen in (4.46) that the system described by s0(q), where q = q + b, has the
important property that w(q) = w(q(q)) and q(q) = q(q(q)). furthermore, using s0(q) =
s0(q), we nd

  ( r2(q)  s0(q)) =   ( r2(q(q))s0(q)) = 0.

(4.58)
now observe that the continuity equation implies that r2(q(q))s0(q) is the curl of some vector.
in general we have r2is0 =  i2...id
i2fi3...id, where f is a (d  2)form. later we will exploit
the eld f . therefore r2(q(q))s0(q) must be a vector. on the other hand, since also s0 is
a vector, we have that r(q(q)) must be a scalar under rotations and translations

i

r(q) = r(q(q)).

in agreement with the fact that   (r2(q)s0(q)) = 0. therefore, we have

g(q) = 

h2
2m

 r
r  q(q) = 

h2
2m

r
r  q(q) = g(q),

(4.59)

(4.60)

that is g is scalar under rotations and translations. this implies that g may depend only on
(s0)2, s0, r, r, (r)2 and higher derivatives which are invariant under rotations and
translations, that is9

g = h((s0)2, s0, r, . . .).

(4.61)

let us now consider the case in which w = pd
dimensional one. in this case we have g = 0, s0 = pd
rk  (qs0,k)1/2. this provides the following constraints

k=1 wk(qk), so that the problem reduces to a one
k=1 rk(qk), where

k=1 s0,k(qk) and r = qd
rk(qk), . . .! = 0.

(4.62)

h xk

(ks0,k)2,xk

2

ks0,k,yk

this implies that h  0. let us show this in two related way. first note that by summing
the one dimensional qshje and then performing a rotation, we arrive to a ddimensional

qshje which does not decompose in 1d qshje in the transformed coordinates. thus (4.62)
also implies h((s0)2, s0, r, . . .) = 0.

9a possible dependence of g on s0 would imply, against eq.(2.20), that s0 satises a dierential equation

involving s0 itself.

28

a similar reasoning to prove that h vanishes identically is to note that by (4.61) and (4.62)

the only possibility to have a nontrivial h is that it depends in a suitable way on terms that
k=1 s0,k(qk). the building blocks to construct such terms have the form
k=1 s0,k(qk). on the other hand, such terms are not
scalar under rotations, so that they may enter in h only if suitably saturated with other indices.

cancel when s0 = pd
jks0, j 6= k, which vanish when s0 = pd

since the only vectorial indices at our disposal are provided by derivatives, we see that there
k=1 wk(qk).

are not terms which are scalar under rotations and vanish identically when w = pd

hence

therefore, we have the basic result that the ep actually implies that in any dimension the

reduced action satises the qshje

g = 0.

and the continuity equation

(4.66)

we stress that also in the higher dimensional case there is a fundamental dierence between

the correspondence (4.64)(4.65) and (4.66) and the one usually considered in the literature.
h s0 cannot be identied
with the wavefunction. in particular, this would cause trouble in the case of bound states, as
s0 would be a constant and inconsistencies arise in the classical limit. this was also evident
from the fact that {s0, q} is not dened for s0 = cnst. in the higher dimensional case, this
would lead to the degeneration of the continuity equation (4.65), with (4.64) resulting in

i

(4.68)

furthermore, s0 is never a constant.

rb(qb) and ra(qa) are related in a simple fashion in the case of rotations, reections, dilatations
and translations. namely, ra(qa) solves the continuity equation in the qasystem if and only
if ra(qa(qb)) solves the continuity equation in the qbsystem. thus, as we already proved in
section 3, we explicitly verify by (4.71) that (qa; qb) vanishes identically in such cases. the
analogous relation for the inversion is

r(q) = rd2r(q) =

rd2


r(q(q)).

(4.72)

basically, we will show that, given a solution r(q) of the continuity equation in the qsystem,
r(q) in eq.(4.72) solves the continuity equation in the qsystem. then, we will verify that
(q; q) = 0, as we proved in section 3 as a direct consequence of the ep.

5 relativistic extension and kleingordon equation

a basic property of the ep is that it has a universal character. in general, the implementation

of the ep leads to a deformation of the corresponding classical hj equation. in this respect, we

note that existence of a xed point in the nonrelativistic stationary case demands the principle

to be implemented in all the other circumstances. if we did not modify the timedependent

case as well, then taking the stationary limit would lead to inconsistencies.

in other words,

since modifying the stationary classical equation comes from a modication of the classical
transformation properties of w, which in general gets an inhomogeneous contribution, such as
(q; qv), consistency implies that also in the timedependent case the potential cannot transform
as in the classical case.

we start by deriving the relativistic quantum hj equation (rqhje). here we will consider

the case in which the external potential is described by an arbitrary potential v (q, t). this form

will be particularly useful in deriving the timedependent quantum hj equation (qhje), which

in turn implies the timedependent schrodinger equation, as the nonrelativistic limit of the

rqhje. later on, we will consider the case in which the interaction is given in terms of the

electromagnetic fourvector a.

the relativistic classical hamiltonjacobi equation (rchje) reads

where

1
2m

d

(kscl(q, t))2 + wrel(q, t) = 0,

xk=1

wrel(q, t) =

1
2mc2 [ m2c4  (v (q, t) + tscl(q, t))2].

in the timeindependent case one has scl(q, t) = scl

0 (q)  et, and (5.1)(5.2) become

1
2m

d

(kscl

0 )2 + wrel = 0,

xk=1

31

(5.1)

(5.2)

(5.3)

and

wrel(q) =

1
2mc2 [ m2c4  (v (q)  e)2].

(5.4)

in the latter case, we can go through the same steps as in the nonrelativistic case and the

stationary rqhje reads

1
2m

(s0)2 + wrel 

h2
2m

r
r

= 0,

where r satises the continuity equation

  (r2s0) = 0.

furthermore, (5.5)(5.6) imply the stationary kleingordon equation

 h2c2 + (m2c4  v 2 + 2ev  e2) = 0,

where  = r exp(is0/h).

5.1 timedependent case

(5.5)

(5.6)

(5.7)

let us start by noticing that in the timedependent case, the (d + 1)dimensional rchje can

be cast in the form (later on summation on repeated indices is understood)

1
2m

sclscl + w 

rel = 0,

where  is the minkowski metric diag (1, 1, . . . , 1), and

rel(q) =

w 

1
2mc2 [ m2c4  v 2(q)  2cv (q)0scl(q)],

(5.8)

(5.9)

where q  (ct, q1, . . . , qd). we thus recognize that eq.(5.8) has the same structure as eq.(5.3),
the euclidean metric being replaced by the minkowskian one. also in this case, in order

to implement the ep, we have to modify the classical equation by adding a function to be

determined, namely

1
2m

(s)2 + wrel + q = 0.

(5.10)

observe that since now w 

rel depends on scl, we have to make the identication

1
2mc2 [ m2c4  v 2(q)  2cv (q)0s(q)],

wrel(q) =
rel for the hamiltonian principal function as now s appears rather than

(5.11)

which diers from w 
scl.

implementation of the ep requires that for an arbitrary w a state

w b

rel(qb) = (pb|pa)w a
32

rel(qa) + (qa; qb),

(5.12)

and

where this time

(pb|p) =

furthermore, we obtain the cocycle condition

(qa; qc) = (pc|pb)h(qa; qb)  (qc; qb)i .

as reported in appendix b, this cocycle condition and the condition

which is the analogue of the condition (2.20), imply that

frel(s, 2s, . . .) = 0,

((q); q) = 0.

important property that wrel(q) = wrel(q). furthermore, we nd

qrel = 

  ( r2  s) =   ( r2s) = 0.

(5.25)

comparing this with the continuity equation   (r2s) = 0, we have that under poincare
transformations, the rfunction of the transformed system dened by s(q) = s(q) has the
transformation property

therefore, by (5.18) and (5.26) we have

r(q) = r(q).

transformations. however, in the timeindependent limit the rqhje must reduce to (5.5), in
particular qrel  q. therefore, g must vanish in this limit implying

then, the rqhje reads

g = 0.

  (r2s) = 0.

5.3 nonrelativistic limit

(5.28)

(5.29)

(5.30)

in this section we will consider the nonrelativistic limit of the rqhje. this will yield the time

dependent nonrelativistic qhje together with the timedependent schrodinger equation.

to perform the classical limit we rst need to make the usual substitution s = s  mc2t

and then taking the limit c  . we have

  (r2s) = 0  m

r2 +   (r2s ) = 0.

(5.33)

therefore, in the nonrelativistic limit eq.(5.29) becomes (we remove the  from r and s)

with the timedependent nonrelativistic continuity equation being

where  = r exp(is/h). note that if we used  = r exp(is/h), then we would get the
complex conjugate of (5.36).

6 gauge invariance and ep

in section 5, we derived the rqhje with an arbitrary potential. as a byproduct, we obtained

the timedependent schrodinger equation in the nonrelativistic limit. this was a nice step as it

indicates that, to be correctly implemented, the ep must be formulated in the exact framework,

that is the relativistic one. in other words, even if the timedependent schrodinger equation can

be derived directly in the nonrelativistic framework [6], the natural realm to implement the ep

is not in the approximate theory. in fact, while the kleingordon equation follows naturally

from the ep, the derivation of the timedependent schrodinger equation is less straightforward

if one derives it directly in the nonrelativistic theory.

however, even if the derivation of the rqhje is perfectly consistent, the formulation be-

comes particularly transparent if one works with gauge theories.

6.1 minimal coupling from the ep

the point is that in general we considered w as an external xed quantity, then the corrections
concerned scl, as s solves an equation which is modied by the quantum potential. nevertheless,
we saw that if one considers the relativistic extension, then w contains s itself. so special
relativity leads to consider w as composed by an external potential and s (see (5.9)). on
the other hand, standard qm problems generally correspond to eective potentials. so, for

example, the potential well, does not exist as a fundamental interaction. thus, the nature of

35

the ep indicates that it should be formulated in the framework of fundamental interactions.

on the other hand, since we are in the relativistic framework, interactions cannot be strictly

separated in kinetic and potential part. so the only possibility is that both are included in a
generalized kinetic term, with w being spacetime independent. it is clear that this xes the
interaction to be described in terms of the minimal coupling. on the other hand, the minimal

coupling prescription is at the heart of gauge theories.

we now show how the ep is simply implemented once one considers the minimal coupling

prescription. let us consider the interaction to be described in terms of the electromagnetic
 = scl is
fourvector a. let us set p cl
 + ea where pcl
the generalized one. in this case the rchje reads

 is particles momentum and p cl

 = pcl

where a0 =  v

ec. note that now

(scl  ea)2 +

mc2 = 0,

w =

2

mc2,

(6.1)

(6.2)

and the critical case corresponds to the limit situation in which m = 0. as usual, in order to

implement the ep, we are forced to add a correction to (6.1)

1
2m

(s  ea)2 +

mc2 + q = 0.

furthermore, we have the transformation properties

and

where

w b(qb) = (pb|pa)w a(qa) + (qa; qb),

qb(qb) = (pb|pa)qa(qa)  (qa; qb),

these transformations imply the cocycle condition

(qa; qc) = (pc|pb)h(qa; qb)  (qc; qb)i .

as we proved in subsection 5.1, (qa; qb) vanishes if qa and qb are related by a conformal trans-
formation.

36

as usual we now have to consider the relevant identity for the (generalized) kinetic term.

we have

d =   ea,

d2  dd = 2  2ea + 2e2a2  e(a).

(6.9)

(6.10)

(6.11)

since the identity (6.9) holds for any r, s and , we can require   (r2(s  ea)) = 0, and
then set  = i/h to have

(s  ea)2 = h2

(6.12)

we stress that there is no loss of generality in considering (6.12) since, by   (r2(s  ea)) = 0,
this is an identity.

(6.13)

(6.14)

(6.15)

similarly to the case of the function g in eq.(5.27), also here g is a scalar function under poincare
transformations. furthermore, since in the a  0 limit we should reproduce eq.(5.29) with
wrel = mc2/2, we see that

g = 0,

(6.16)

and the rqhje reads

(s  ea)2 + m2c2  h2

2r
r

= 0,

where r and s satisfy the continuity equation

  (r2(s  ea)) = 0.

(6.17)

(6.18)

let us stress that the same result can be directly obtained from (5.1)(5.2) by observing that
(5.8) coincides with (6.1) after setting wrel = mc2/2 and replacing scl by scl  ea.

37

one can check that eqs.(6.17)(6.18) imply the kleingordon equation

where

(ih + ea)2 + m2c2 = 0,

 = re

i

h s.

if we considered  = re i

h s, then we would have the complex conjugate of (6.19)

(ih  ea)2 + m2c2 = 0.

(6.19)

(6.20)

(6.21)

in the timeindependent limit a = ( v

ec, 0, . . . , 0), tv = 0, both (6.19) and (6.21) re-
duce to the stationary kleingordon equation (5.7). correspondingly, eq.(6.18) reduces to the

stationary continuity equation (5.6)

  (r2(s  ea)) =   (r2s0) 

1
c2 (tr2(v  e) + r2tv ) =   (r2s0) = 0.

(6.22)

6.2 ep and mass generation

a special property of the ep is that it cannot be implemented in cm because of the xed
point corresponding to w 0  0. implementing the ep then forces us to introduce a univocally
determined piece to the classical hj equation. a remarkable fact is that in the case of the
rchje (6.1), the xed point w 0(q0)  0 corresponds to m = 0. the ep then implies that
from this all the other masses can be generated by a coordinate transformation. thus, we have

masses correspond to the inhomogeneous term in the transformation properties of the w 0 state
(6.23)

mc2 = (q0; q).

1
2

furthermore, by (6.4) (6.5) masses are expressed in terms of the quantum potential

1
2

mc2 = (p|p0)q0(q0)  q(q).

(6.24)

a basic feature of the formulation is that the ep implies that s is never trivial. so, for
example also in the case of the nonrelativistic particle with v  e = 0, we have a nontrivial
in particular, in [6] the role of the quantum potential was seen
quantum potential [1][6].

as a sort of intrinsic selfenergy which is reminiscent of the relativistic selfenergy. eq.(6.24)

provides a more explicit evidence of such an interpretation.

furthermore, in [5, 6] it has been shown that tunnelling is a direct consequence of the

quantum potential. in particular, q provides the energy to make p real, and can be seen as

38

the response of the particle selfenergy to external potentials. this example also shows that

external potential and particle energy are strictly related, and so they should be considered as

components of a single object. in part, this is what the minimal coupling prescription provides.

however, the ep, which naturally leads to such a prescription, also implies the additional

quantum potential. in [1][6] it has been shown that this contribution is not xed, rather it

may change once the hidden variables are changed. in particular, a change of  corresponds
to a mixing between the p2/2m term and the quantum potential. we now show that in higher
dimension there is a new degree of freedom, represented by an antisymmetric tensor, which is

related to the hidden variables.

6.3 ep and the hidden antisymmetric tensor of qm

a basic property of the formulation immediately appears in one dimension once we consider the

qshje. to understand this point it is useful to recall that the dierence between the qshje

and the one considered by bohm, is that the qshje is written in terms of one function only:
the reduced action s0. while we always have s0 6= cnst, in bohm theory one has s0 = cnst for
bound states. however, if one excludes, as implied by the ep, the trivial solution, then one can

obtain the qshje from the standard version. in doing this one has to express r in terms of
s0 by solving the continuity equation. we now show that if one tries to write down the qhje
in higher dimension by solving the continuity equation, then a new eld appears. we already

encountered this situation in subsection 4.2. namely, we saw that the continuity equation of
the qshje implies that r2s0 is given by the generalized curl of a (d  2)form f . more
precisely, we saw that

this equation is equivalent to

r2is0 =  i2...id

i

i2fi3...id .

r2is0 = jbij,

where bij is the antisymmetric twotensor

bij =  i3...id

ij

fi3...id .

in other words, the 2form b is the hodge dual of f

and the continuity equation is

b = f,

d+d+  f = ddf = 0.

39

(6.25)

(6.26)

(6.27)

(6.28)

(6.29)

in the timedependent relativistic case f is a (d  1)form. we have
1f2...d = b,

r2(s  ea) =  1...d



that is

or, equivalently,

r2 =

(s  ea)
(s  ea)2 b,

r4 =

bb

(s  ea)2 .

in terms of b and r the rqhje (6.17) reads

 bb + r4m2c2  h2r32r = 0.

(6.30)

(6.31)

(6.32)

(6.33)

the ep itself and the appearance of a new eld indicates that now the rqhje should be

considered in a dierent context with respect to the usual one. so, for example, one may wonder

if the beld may help in considering a possible quantum origin of fundamental interactions. in

the introduction we suggested that qm and gr are facets of the same medal. more generally

one should understand if there is a possible role of qm underlying the fundamental interactions

or, more precisely, whether the ep underlies the structure of fundamental interactions trhough

qm. we already saw evidence of the dynamical role of qm through the quantum potential [6],

e.g. in considering the tunnel eect. in this context one should understand whether eq.(6.33)

may provide a dierent understanding of the usual problems one meets in considering the klein

gordon equation.

let us nd how r transforms under general vmaps, q  q(q) = v(q). in the q system we

have

f2...d =

1f2...d =

 q! 0...d (0s  ea0)1f2...d,

(6.35)

where we used the fact that the second derivatives of the jacobian matrix get cancelled due to

the antisymmetry of the levicivita tensor. finally, by (6.30) and (6.31), we have

r2 = det  q

 q! (p|p)r2,

40

(6.36)

that holds also in the stationary nonrelativistic case with (p|p) given by (2.16). given (6.36),
we easily rederive the transformation property of r under the inversion q(q) we derived in
subsection 4.3. in fact by (3.32) and (3.33) we have det2(j 1) = det(r41d), that is

det2  q
then, as by (3.34) (p|p) = r4, we obtain

q! = det(r41d) = r4d,

r2(q) = r2d4r2(q).

(6.37)

(6.38)

it is then convenient to use (6.36) to nd the transformation property of r under the inversion

(b.4). by (b.9) and (b.10), we have

r2(q) = (q2)d1r2(q).

(6.39)

a

in this appendix we report the proof of eqs.(3.12)(3.27) and (3.41) concerning the structure of
the function (qa; qb) in the cases in which qa and qb are related by a translations, dilatations
and inversion respectively.

let us start by considering the function

g(d, q) = (q + d; q),

(a.1)

where d is an arbitrary constant vector. in terms of g(d, q), eq.(3.11) yields

g(d, q + b)  c(q + b + d) + c(q + d) = g(d, q)  c(q + b) + c(q).

(a.2)

taking the derivative of both sides of eq.(a.2) with respect to bj, we get

qj g(d, q + b)  qj c(q + b + d) = qj c(q + b).

after setting bj = 0 and integrating

g(d, q) = c(q + d)  c(q) + g(d, q),

(a.3)

(a.4)

where, as before, by q we denote all the components of q other than qj, and, by eq.(3.26), g(d, q)
vanishes if all the components of d other than dj are zero. furthermore, plugging eq.(a.4)
into eq.(3.10), we realize that g(d, q) shares the same properties as g(d, q). therefore, the
analogue of eq.(a.4) holds for g(d, q) as well. hence, applying this reasoning recursively we
end up with

(q + d; q) = f (q + d)  f (q) + h(d),

(a.5)

41

where h(d) vanishes whenever only one component of d is not zero. however, by (3.10), we

nd that h is linear

which implies

so that

h(d + e) = h(d) + h(e),

h(d) =

d

xk=1

akdk,

h = 0,

and we arrive to eq.(3.12), that is

note that the right hand side remains invariant under the constant shift

(q + d; q) = f (q + d)  f (q),

f  f + c.

(a.6)

(a.7)

(a.8)

(a.9)

(a.10)

let us now analyze the consequences of (a.9) on h(a, q) = (aq, q). by (2.32) and noting

that (p|pa) = a2, we have

(a(q + b); q) = (a(q + b); q + b) + (q + b; q) = a2(aq + ab; aq) + (aq; q),

(a.11)

which is equivalent to

h(a, q + b)  h(a, q) = a2[f (aq + ab)  f (aq)]  f (q + b) + f (q),
where now b is an arbitrary vector. taking the derivative with respect to bj

qj h(a, q + b) = a3qj f (aq + ab)  qj f (q + b),

and setting b = 0 we nd

that upon integration yields

qj h(a, q) = a3qj f (aq)  qj f (q),

h(a, q) = a2f (aq)  f (q) + g(a).

(a.12)

(a.13)

(a.14)

(a.15)

a useful observation is that h(a, q) = (aq; q) evaluated at q = 0 cannot depend on a, so that

h(a, 0) = h(1, 0) = 0. therefore

g(a) = (a2  1)f (0),

42

(a.16)

and h(a, q) = a2(f (aq)f (0))(f (q)f (0)), that, upon the relabeling f (q)  f (q)f (0),
coincides with (3.27), that is

where now

(aq; q) = a2f (aq)  f (q),

f (0) = 0.

note that this xes the ambiguity (a.10).

we now complete the proof of eq.(3.41). first of all note that by (2.32)

((aq); q) = (p|pa)((aq); aq) + (aq; q).

on the other hand, by (2.32) and (3.38)

((aq); q) = (a1q; q) = (p|p)(a1q; q) + (q; q),

(a.17)

(a.18)

(a.19)

(a.20)

so that

and by (3.27)

a2((aq); aq) + (aq; q) = r4(a1q; q) + (q; q),

(a.21)

a2((aq); aq) + a2f (aq)  f (q) =

1
r4 [a2f (a1q)  f (q)] + (q; q).

(a.22)

picking a q0 such that q

0 = q0 and noticing that r0 = 1, we have by (3.40) and (a.22) that

((aq0); aq0) = a4f (a1q0)  f (aq0).

(a.23)

now observe that any q can be expressed as aq0, where a = r and with q0 a suitable solution
of q = q. furthermore, by (3.38) we have a1q0 = (aq0), so that (a.23) is equivalent to
eq.(3.41), that is

(q; q) =

1
r4 f (q)  f (q).

(a.24)

b

in section 3 we showed that, as a consequence of eq.(2.32), (qa; qb) vanishes identically if qa
and qb are related by a mobius transformation. in the present case, we can prove the analogous
result that (qa; qb) vanishes if qa and qb are related by a conformal transformation, where the
conformal group, with respect to the minkowski metric, is generated by translations

(b.3)

(b.4)

where q2 = qq. note that for the inversion to be welldened, rd+1 must be completed
by a cone at innity [22]. this space is the analogue of rd+1. the proof is the same as the one
provided in section 3 and in appendix a. in particular, we have

(q + b; q) = f (q + b)  f (q).
(aq; q) = a2f (aq)  f (q),
(q; q) = f (q)  f (q),

(b.5)

(b.6)

(b.7)

where f is an arbitrary function satisfying f (0) = 0. as far as the inversion is concerned, the

proof needs to be slightly modied. the jacobian matrix of this mapping is given by

and that

(q; q)|q=q0 = 0,

(q; q)|q=q1 = (q; q)|q=q1,

where q1 satises q = q. by (5.16)

((aq); q) = (p|pa)((aq); aq) + (aq; q).

on the other hand, by (5.16) and (b.14)

((aq); q) = (a1q; q) = (p|p)(a1q; q) + (q; q),

therefore, by (b.6)

a2((aq); aq) + a2f (aq)  f (q) =

1
q4 [a2f (a1q)  f (q)] + (q; q).

picking a q0 such that q

0 = q0, eq.(b.20) yields

now observe that any q, such that q2 > 0, can be expressed as aq0, where a2 = q2, and with q0
a suitable solution of q = q. furthermore, by (b.14) we have a1q0 = (aq0), so that (b.21) is
equivalent to

(q; q) =

q2 > 0.

on the other hand, picking a q1 such that q

((aq1); aq1) = a4f (a1q

1)  f (aq1) + a2(f (q1)  f (q

taking a = 1, (b.23) becomes

(q1; q

which, by virtue of (b.17), is equivalent to

(b.26)

now observe that any q, such that q2 < 0, can be expressed as aq1, where a2 = q2, and with
q1 a suitable solution of q = q. furthermore, by (b.14) we have a1q
1 = (aq1), so that
(b.26) is equivalent to

thus, in general

(q; q) =

1
q4 f (q)  f (q),

q2 < 0.

(q; q) =

1
q4 f (q)  f (q).

however, also in the relativistic case we have the analogue of condition (2.20)

then, the same reasoning as in subsection 3.5 leads to

frel(s, 2s, . . .) = 0.

therefore, we can state the following result

f = 0.

(b.27)

(b.28)

(b.29)

(b.30)

eq.(b.29) and the cocycle condition (5.16) imply that (qa; qb) vanishes when qa and qb are related
