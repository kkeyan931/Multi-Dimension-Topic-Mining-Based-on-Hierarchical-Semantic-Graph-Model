abstract

we discuss the ways of constructing the exact superpotential for
n=1 supersymmetric theories and propose a new approach. as a con-
sequence, a new structure of the superpotential is found.

1 introduction

the existence of n=1 supersymmetry in the standard model was conrmed
by the indirect experimental data [1, 2]. that is why the dynamics of super-
symmetric theories should be thoroughly investigated, especially beyond the
frames of the perturbation theory. this case, being the most complicated, is of
the most interest, because nonperturbative eects seem to produce the quark
connement.

recently there is a considerable progress in understanding of the nonpertur-
bative dynamics, caused by [3]. in this paper the sum of instanton corrections
was found explicitly for the simplest n=2 supersymmetric yang-mills theory
with su(2) gauge group. however, this model is very far from the realis-
tic ones, the investigation of n=1 supersymmetric models being much more
interesting.

n=1 supersymmetric theories were considered rst in [4].

in this paper
the eective potential was found from the exact conservation of r-symmetry
current beyond the perturbation theory. this approach was developed in [5],
where it was proposed to use composite elds for the description of the theory
for nf  nc.
however, the corresponding superpotential does not agree with instanton
calculations and does not reproduce quantum anomalies. these problems can

be solved by introducing a new composite eld  gluino condensate. at the
perturbative level anomalies are reproduced by the veneziano-yankielowitch
eective lagrangian [6]. however, it is not applicable beyond the frames of
the perturbative theory. at the nonperturbative level it is possible to use the
relation between perturbative and exact anomalies, which allows to construct
a superpotential, that is in agreement with the transformation law of the
collective coordinate measure and reproduces quantum anomalies [7]. for
nc  nf it is possible to integrate the gluino condensate out of it and obtain
seibergs exact results, but for nc > nf it is not so [8].
however, in the present paper we argue, that the method, based on using
of composite elds, suers from some problems and propose a new approach.
as a consequence we nd a new form of the eective superpotential.

the paper is organized as follows: in section 2 we briey remind some
results, obtained in the frames of the approach, proposed by seiberg  aeck-
dine-seberg superpotential (section 2.1) and nonperturbative generalization of
veneziano-yankielowitch eective lagrangian (section 2.2). here we discuss
main shortcomings of these expressions and make a conclusion, that a new
approach is needed. this new approach is formulated in section 3. in this
section we also construct our main result  exact eective action for the massive
n=1 supersymmetric yang-mills theory with su(nc) gauge group and nf
matter supermultiplets. the results are briey discussed in the conclusion.
in the appendix we derive the expression for the superpotential and prove its
uniqueness.

2 exact superpotential  usual approach

2.1 aeck-dine-seiberg superpotential

the rst attempt to construct the exact superpotential for n = 1 super-

symmetric theories was made in [4].

it is well known, that in this case there is a special chiral symmetry (so
called r-symmetry), which is not destroyed by the perturbative quantum cor-
rections. assuming, that the correspondent current is also conserved beyond
the frames of the perturbation theory, aeck, dine and seiberg constructed
the following superpotential, depending only on scalar elds and reproducing
zero anomaly of r-symmetry:

2

la = z d2

3ncnf
ncnf 



2nf

ncnf

(1)

(here la denotes the holomorphic part of the eective lagrangian.)

however, this superpotential can not be generated by instantons, because
for the n=1 supersymmetric yang-mills theory with su(nc) gauge group and
nf matter supermultiplets the instanton corrections should be proportional to

la  (3ncnf )n
where n is the module of a topological number.

(2)

moreover, (1) does not reproduce anomalies (except for r-symmetry) ac-

cording to the equation

hj 

()i = 




(3)

because it does not contain gauge degrees of freedom.

the development of the ads-approach was given in [5]. the dynamics was
argued to depend crucially on the numbers of colors and avors. for example,
for nf > nc it was proposed to use gauge invariant variables, parametrizing
the moduli space, as new quantum elds, while for nf < nc the eective action
depends on the original elds. for nf = nc instanton corrections to a special
classical constrain lead to the necessity of introducing lagrange multiplier to
the eective action.

however, the problems mentioned above were not solved. moreover, these

results do not explain the phenomenon of connement.

2.2 nonperturbative

generalization

of

veneziano-yankielowitch eective lagrangian

the development of this approach in [7] allowed to construct a superpoten-
tial, agreeing with the transformation law of the collective coordinate measure
and reproducing anomalies of chiral symmetries. the matter is that construct-
ing exact superpotential it is impossible to omit gauge degrees of freedom. in
the frames of the above approach it is a gluino condensate s = w 2
a .

taking this dependence into account it is possible to nd the following

expression for the superpotential [7]

3

la =

16

(4)

here  (a) coincides with the correspondent function in the seiberg-witten
solution, dened by

where

(5)

(6)

in the frames of the approach, proposed by seiberg, the parameter z is a
function of mesons, barions and gluino condensate s. the exact expres-
sion, found in [7], has the following form:

3ncnf

detm sncnf

nc > nf

3ncnf snf nc

z =

z =

nc  nf

taking the asymptotic of the exact solution

 (a) 

2i


ln a,

a   (z  0)

,

(7)

(8)

we obtain, that at the perturbative level (4) coincides with the veneziano-
yankielowitch eective lagrangian.

therefore, (4) can be considered as a synthesis of seibergs exact results

and veneziano-yankielowitch eective lagrangian.

in addition we should point out, that the gluino condensate s is a natural
lagrange multiplier if nf = nc and, moreover, (4) allows to treat theories
with n=2 and n=1 supersymmetry in a similar way.

however, (4) (with the parameter z given by (7)) suers from some prob-
lems. for example, it seems, that a theory can not be described by gauge

4

invariant composite elds in principle. really, note, that in the frames of the
above approach the gluino condensate should be considered as a new scalar
quantum eld, because otherwise some operations with s become senseless.
for example, if s = w 2
a it is impossible to take ln s, because the lowest
component of this supereld contains anticommuting spinors. moreover, all
suciently large powers of s are simply equal to 0 due to the same reason.
therefore, s is a new scalar eld which should be integrated out on shell [9]. if
it is possible, formally we should obtain seibergs exact results. nevertheless,
it is impossible for nc > nf , because in this case the equation

w
s

= 0

(9)

has no solutions [8]. for nc  nf there are solutions, but, as we mentioned
above, integrating the gluino condensate out of the eective action seems to
be impossible in principle. by other words, the yang-mills theory should be
formulated in terms of the gauge eld aa
, but not in terms of gauge invariant
f 2
, and, therefore, s, m b
a and so on can not be considered as quantum elds.

3 another approach to construct exact super-

potential

taking into account the arguments, given in the previous section, it is nec-
essary to propose another approach for constructing an exact superpotential.
an exact result should satisfy the following evident conditions:

1. it should depend on the original elds of the theory.
2. it should agree with dynamical (perturbative and instanton) calcula-
tions (this requirement is much more restrictive, than the agreement with the
transformation law of the collective coordinate measure).

the purpose of the present paper is to construct an expression for the

eective superpotential, satisfying these requirements.

first, let us nd its general structure. note, that there is a relation be-
tween perturbative and instanton contributions [10, 11, 12]. for example, the
renorminvariance of instanton corrections allows to construct exact -functions
of supersymmetric theories.

5

let us express this relation mathematically. chose a scale m and denote
the value of the coupling constant at this scale by e. then the perturba-
tive result is proportional to 1/4e2, while the instanton contributions are
proportional to exp(82n/e2), where n is the module of a topological num-
ber. (perturbative and (each of) instanton contributions are renorminvariant
separately.)

the holomorphic part of the perturbative eective action can be written as

la =

1

16

im trz d2 w 2  4i

e2
ef f

+

ef f

2 !

(10)

where eef f and ef f are renorminvariant functions of elds, the eective per-
turbative coupling and -term respectively. denoting

z  exp 2i(cid:16) 4i

e2
ef f

+

ef f

2 (cid:17)!

(11)

we obtain, that the exact eective action (with instanton contributions) can
be written as

la = 

1

322 re trz d2 w 2f (z) = 

1

322 re trz d2 w 2(cid:16) ln z +



xn=1

cnzn(cid:17)

(12)
note, that this expression is valid beyond the constant eld approximation

(that is usually assumed in derivation of the exact results).

the function f (z) can be found explicitly. the matter is that the conditions

f (z) = ln z +



xk=1

cnzn;

re f (z) < 0

(13)

dene its form uniquely. (the latter equation is a requirement of a positiveness
of the squared eective coupling). in the appendix a we prove, that these
conditions uniquely lead to

where  (a) is the seiberg-witten solution (5). therefore, nally,

f (z) = 2i  (z1/4)

la =

1

16

imz d2 w 2 (z1/4)

6

(14)

(15)

where the parameter z can be found approximately by the one-loop calcula-
tions and exactly (up to a constant factor) by investigation of the collective
coordinate measure, similar to [11, 12].

let us consider, for example, n=1 supersymmetric yang-mills theory with
su(nc) gauge group and nf matter supermultiplets. because in the one-loop
approximation

(e) = 

e3
162 (3nc  nf )

(16)

the parameter z should be proportional to m 3ncnf , where m is an uv-cuto.
this result, of course, can be obtained from the collective coordinate measure
[13].

the exact results, reminded in the previous section, were obtained for a
massless case. however, in realistic theories most elds are massive (except
for the gauge bosons, corresponding to an unbroken group). that is why the
massive case is the most interesting for the physical applications. of course, we
will assume, that the supersymmetry is broken, although will not care about
the concrete mechanism. it is important only, that there are some soft terms
in the lagrangian.

the purpose is to construct the eective action in the low-energy limit,
below the thresholds for all massive particles. the contributions of massive
particles into the running coupling constant are xed at the masses and, there-
fore, their contributions to the parameter z will be proportional to m/m in a
power, dened by the corresponding coecient of the -function. it is much
more dicult to investigate the contributions of massless gauge elds. of
course, in this case the coupling constant is not xed at a denite value and
we need to perform a detailed analysis of the ir behavior of the theory. note,
that we are interested not in the renormgroup functions but in the eective
action, that can be calculated, for example, in the constant eld limit. there-
fore, the contribution of the massless gauge eld to the parameter z will be a
function of these elds.

because the parameter z is a scalar, we need to nd a scalar supereld
containing f and not having anticommuting elds in the lowest component
(otherwise all suciently large powers of z will be equal to 0 or innity). the
only such supereld is

 + o()

(17)

where the index a runs over the generators of a gauge group. (at the pertur-
bative level similar expression was proposed in [14]).

therefore, taking into account dimensional arguments, we obtain, that the
contribution of massless gauge elds to the parameter z is proportional to
m/b1/4 in a power, dened by the corresponding coecient of -function.

the -function of the considered model can be written as

(e) = 

e3
162 (cgauge + c + cq + csq)

(18)

where

cgauge =

c =

csq =

(19)

are contributions of gauge elds (with ghosts), their spinor superpartners,
quarks and squarks respectively. so, according to the above arguments, we
obtain, that

z = e82/e2

m 3ncnf  m2/3

b11/12!nc



q m1/3

(cid:16)m2/3

sq (cid:17)nf

(20)

where m is a gluino mass, (mq)j
mass matrix.

i is a quark mass matrix and (msq)j

i is a squark

however, this expression was found in the frames of the one-loop approx-
imation. to take into account multiloop eects we should note [11, 12], that
the collective coordinate measure [13] contains a factor

e2 !nc
 82

(21)

of course, it will be also present in z. so, nally, the parameter z (up to a
constant factor c) is written as

z = c  82

e2 !nc

e82/e2

m 3ncnf  m2/3

b11/12!nc



8

(cid:16)det(mq)j

i(cid:17)2/3(cid:16)det(msq)j

i(cid:17)1/3

(22)

where we take into account su(nf ) symmetry under the global rotations in
the avor space.

4 conclusion

the main result of the present paper is the eective superpotential (15)
with the parameter z, given by (22). this expression is in agreement with the
perturbative calculations and possibly do not contradict to instanton calcula-
tions (although the explicit check, similar to [15] seems to be very interesting).
moreover, it is easy to see, that this result is in agreement with the exact -
function, calculated in [11].

the structure (15) is dierent from the exact results, found in [7], and,
especially, in [4] or [5]. the results depend on the original (instead of compos-
ite) elds. the presence of mass is also very important. in the massless limit
the obtained results become ill dened. it is very dicult to say, if it is nec-
essary to consider massless theories. at least, these theories have complicated
problems in the ir-region.

in the present paper we did not discuss the physical consequences of the

results. it will be done separately in other papers.

appendix

a explicit expression for f (z) and its unique-

ness

let us prove, that the conditions

9

f (z) = ln z +



xk=1

cnzn;

re f (z) < 0

(23)

uniquely dene the function f (z) and nd it explicitly. for this purpose we
introduce a new variable a  z1/4 (this choice of the power will be explained
below) and write formally

where u(a) is an undened function. dening f (a) as

a

df
da

d2u
da2

= 4

2i

d2f
da2  f,

(24)

(25)

we can rewrite (24) in the form, similar to the exact anomaly in the seiberg-
witten model [16, 17]

f + fd = 

2i


u

where

fd = f  aad;

ad =

df
da

dierentiating (26) with respect to u twice, we obtain, that

ad

d2a
du2  a

d2ad
du2 = 0

(26)

(27)

(28)

therefore, the functions a(u) and ad(u) can be identied with two linear

independent solutions of the equation

(cid:16) d2
ad !
du2 + l(u)(cid:17)  a

(29)

where l(u) is an (so far) undened function. substituting the asymptotic
fpert(z) = ln z into (24), we obtain, that upert = a2/2. therefore, in the frames
of perturbation theory

l(u)pert =

1
4u2

10

(30)

using (25) we nd, that

(ad)pert =

2i


2u(cid:16) ln2u  1(cid:17)

(31)

is a second linear independent solution of this equation. hence, the mon-
odromy at the innity is

m =   1

0

2 1 !

(32)

and coincides with the correspondent monodromy in the seiberg-witten
model. the further arguments completely repeat the derivation of seiberg-
witten exact result by the method, proposed in [18]. finally, we conclude,
that the functions a(u) and ad(u) coincide with the seiberg-witten solution
(6).

now it is quite clear, that the substitution z = a4 was made in order
to obtain the correct structure of the expansion (23). the uniqueness of the
solution (with the condition re f < 0) can be proven similar to [19].
