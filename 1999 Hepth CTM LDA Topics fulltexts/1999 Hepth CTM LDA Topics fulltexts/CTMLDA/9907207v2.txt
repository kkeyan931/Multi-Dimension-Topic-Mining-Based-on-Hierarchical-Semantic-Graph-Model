abstract

we join quintessence cosmological scenarios with the duality sim-
metry existing in string dilaton cosmologies. actually, we consider
the tracker potential type v = v0/ and show that duality is only
established if  = 2.

in this short letter we show how duality simmetry can be connected with

the so - called quintessence theories.

duality (see the recent review paper on this topic by m. gasperini [4]
and the almost complete references therein) is an extra - simmetry exist-
ing (in the cosmological arena : we will use a standard 3+1 friedmann -
robertson - walker splitting of spacetime, i.e.
the cosmological principle)
in the minisuperspace associate with scalar - theories of gravity (see [2] and
the references therein). essentially this simmetry is such that if a(t) is a
cosmological solution, then a1(t) is also a solution when the scalar eld
(dilaton) present in this approach to gravity undergoes to the trasformation
   =   (3/2) ln a. of course this simmetry implies the existence of a
new fundamental constant s, i.e. the fundamental string scaling. the rea-
son of the great interest in string theory is very well described in the quoted
paper by gasperini [4] and we make reference to it for a discussion on this
topic.

the second ingredient we discuss in our paper is quintessence, which
has been developed recently [1], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10] because the astronomical
observations suggest that there is present in the universe a very large amount
of energy density with a negative pressure. we may consider it as given by
a scalar eld  slowly rolling down its potential and such that 1 < w < 0,
where w = p/, being p and  the pressure and the energy density
of the scalar eld. actually recent considerations [7] x this interval to
1 as a matter of fact, quintessence has
be smaller :1 < w  0.6.
been advanced resuming, generalizing and suitably readapting older ideas
on cosmology with a scalar eld, i.e. scalar - tensor theories of gravity. (see
also the introduction of the so - called x - matter [11], [12], [13], [14].) one
of the most common potential used in quintessence theories is of the type
v = v0, (where v0 and  > 0 are parameters); its discussion can be
found in the literature already quoted, but see also [3] because we are going
to analyse quintessence in a non - minimal coupled theory.

these are the two ingredients we are going to join in what follows.
we will refer to the general string action :

1we like to remember that a cosmological constant  which can be connected with

vacuum energy density has w = 1.

where lm rapresents all the others matter source, and the antisymmetric
tensor b present in the string theory has been taken zero as usual in string
cosmology; nally, we will assume d = 3.

let us consider cosmological non - minimally coupled models described by

the general action :

a = z d4xg(cid:26)(cid:20)f ()r +

(2)

here, the coupling function f = f () is completely generic, as well as, at
this level, the potential v (). we suppose that in (1) and (2) lm = 0,
that is, we consider a situation in which there are no sources other than the
scalar eld. furthermore we have introduced a generic coecient  in the
kinetic part because of the discrepancy existing, on this coecient, between
(1) and the standard non - minimal coupled scalar - tensor action. from (2),
in the flrw cosmological case, we get the following point - like lagrangian
dened in the minisuperspace a(t), (t):

let us choose the potential commonly used in the quintessence approach,
i.e. :

(4)
considering now  completely arbitrary 2. let us change   0e and
write the coupling as :
(5)

f = f0e2f () ,

v = v0 ,

being (f0, 0, ) constants and f () a generic function of the new  - eld.
using these new variables and functions, lagrangian (3) becomes :

2we do not enter in details on the way of putting constraints on this parameter because

the goal of our paper is dierent; in any case see [5].

and we recover duality if  = 2. that is, duality simmetry requires that the
potential has to be v = v02
0, i.e. it is not possible to recover the quintessence
standard powerlaw type potential.

as a nal remark we want to stress that, if we compute the parameter
  v v /(v )2 using the initial potential v = v02, we get  = 1/2, so
that  < 1. 3 if we compute the same quantity relatively to the potential
v = v0e2k (which is the same one used by b. ratra [15]) given in (10),
after the change (7) of minisuperspace variables, we nd  = 1. that is, we
have to carefully compute how  changes under the (more general than (7))
transformation :

a straightforward calculation shows that :

a = a ,

and relation (13) gives rise exactly to  = 1, as required by the potential
present in (10).

3to get a tracker eld, a special form of quintessence, we need to have  > 1 [9], [10].

in a forthcoming analysis we will study relation (13), which naturally
comes out in the string duality approach, in order to understand whether the
quintessence requirement  > 1 is (minisuperspace) coordinate dependent or
not.
