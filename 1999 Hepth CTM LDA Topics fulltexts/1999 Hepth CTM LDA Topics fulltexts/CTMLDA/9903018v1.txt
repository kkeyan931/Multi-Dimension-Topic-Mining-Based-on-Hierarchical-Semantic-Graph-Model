abstract

we continue mccartor and robertsons recent demonstration of the indispensabil-
ity of ghost elds in the light-cone gauge quantization of gauge elds. it is shown that

the ghost elds are indispensable in deriving well-dened antiderivatives and in regular-
izing the most singular component of gauge eld propagator. to this end it is sucient
to conne ourselves to noninteracting abelian elds. furthermore to circumvent deal-

ing with constrained systems, we construct the temporal gauge canonical formulation
of the free electromagnetic eld in auxiliary coordinates x = (x, x+, x1, x2) where
x = x0cos  x3sin, x+ = x0sin + x3cos and x plays the role of time.
in so
doing we can quantize the elds canonically without any constraints, unambiguously

introduce static ghost elds as residual gauge degrees of freedom and construct the
light-cone gauge solution in the light-cone representation by simply taking the light-
cone limit (  
4 ). as a by product we nd that, with a suitable choice of vacuum
the mandelstam-leibbrandt form of the propagator can be derived in the  = 0 case
(the temporal gauge formulation in the equal-time representation).

a fundamental problem is to specify the antiderivatives which arise in relating constrained
elds to the true degrees of freedom of the system. quantization has traditionally been

carried out in parallel with the axial gauge formulation of qed in the ordinary space-
time coordinates. thus x+

evolution parameter and the gauge xing condition and the gauss law constraint has been

diracs canonical quantization procedure can not resolve this diculty because one has to
make use of the same operator (l


)1to dene inverse of the constraints matrix.6)

furthermore, if (1  1) is used to dene the inverse derivative, the spurious singularity at

is necessarily dened as the principal value(pv); but evaluating the singularity as the
pv generates extra contributions so that light-cone gauge calculations do not agree with
those performed in covariant gauges.7) to overcome the latter diculty the mandelstam-
leibbrandt(ml) prescription has been proposed so as not to generate extra contributions
and give results consistent with feynman propagators.8) bassetto et al derived the ml pre-
scription in the light-cone gauge using a canonical operator formalism in the ordinary space-
time coordinates and found that ghost elds associated with lagrange multiplier elds are
essential to the derivation.9)

since there exists an operator solution which has the ml form of the propagator, one
expects that a consistent operator formulation of lfft can also be constructed by intro-

ducing the ghost elds as residual gauge degrees of freedom. however, since the residual
gauge functions in the light-cone gauge formulation are ones depending on x+
l , x1 and x2,
one cannot expect to calculate the dynamical operators by integrating densities over the
three dimensional hyperplanes x+
l =constant. recently these problems were studied by one
of the authors of the present paper(mccartor) and robertson in the light-cone formulation
of qed.10) they found that the ghost elds can be introduced in such a way that the trans-
lational generator p l
+ consists of physical degrees of freedom integrated over the hyperplane
x+
l =constant and ghost degrees of freedom integrated over the hyperplane xl =constant.
they also found that the ghost elds have to be initialized along a hyperplane xl = constant,
while physical elds evolve from the usual hyperplane x+
l = constant. the same problems
were considered by morara and soldati11), who constructed the light-cone temporal gauge
formulation, where all elds evolve from a single initial value surface and the ml form of

the propagator is realized.

in this paper we further investigate how the ghost elds fulll roles as regulator elds

in the light-cone gauge formulation of gauge theories. to avoid inessential complications
and to circumvent dealing with constrained systems, we conne ourselves to noninteracting

abelian elds  the free electromagnetic elds  and construct the canonical operator
solution of them in the gauge a = a0cos + x3sin = 0 and in the auxiliary coordinates
x = (x, x+, x1, x2) where

x = x0cos  x3sin, x+ = x0sin + x3cos.

(1.4)

the same framework was also used by hornbostel to analyze two-dimensional models.12) in
doing so we can choose x as the evolution parameter in the interval 0 < 
4 and construct
the temporal gauge formulation, where canonical quantization conditions are to be imposed
without any constraints. furthermore we can take x+ to be the evolution parameter in
the interval 
2 and thus construct the axial gauge formulation. consequently we
can expect that taking the light-cone limit   
4 will enable us to nd light-cone gauge
solutions and to compare the temporal light-front limit (  
4  0) with the axial light-front
limit(  

in sect.2 the temporal gauge canonical operator solution is constructed in the auxiliary
coordinates and it is shown that static ghost elds are present as residual gauge degrees

4 <  

4 + 0).

of freedom. we also encounter the problem that canonical commutation relations can not
distinguish the pv and ml prescriptions13) but that the ml prescription can always be
obtained if we employ an appropriate representation of the ghost elds. as a consequence

3

we nd that the ml prescription can always be implemented even in the  = 0 case, namely
in the temporal gauge formulation in the ordinary space-time coordinates. we also point

out that the axial gauge formulation is not straightforward to construct, at least by these
procedures.

in sect.3 we show that the free electromagnetic elds given as the temporal light-cone
limit are identical with the ones given by mccartor and robertson and by morara and soldati
and equivalent to those given by bassetto et al in the ordinary space-time coordinates. we

also show in detail that in the light-cone gauge formulation the ghost elds are indispensable
to well-dened antiderivatives and that linear divergences are eliminated in what is otherwise
the most singular component of x+

l - ordered propagator.

sect.4 is devoted to concluding remarks.

2. temporal gauge formulation in the auxiliary coordinates

we begin by xing the metric of the auxiliary coordinates x = (x, x+, x1, x2) where x

and x+ are dened by

x = x0cos  x3sin,

x+ = x0sin + x3cos.

inverting these, we nd that x0 and x3 are given by

x0 = xcos + x+sin,

x3 = xsin + x+cos

so that (x0)2  (x3)2 is expressed in terms of x and x+ as

(x0)2  (x3)2 = x(xcos2 + x+sin2) + x+(xsin2  x+cos2).

(2.1)

(2.2)

(2.3)

rewriting this in the form xx + x+x+ requires that x and x+ are dened respectively by

x = xcos2 + x+sin2,

x+ = xsin2  x+cos2.

it follows from this that

g = cos2, g+ = g+ = sin2, g++ = cos2.

upper components of metric tensor are obtained by inverting (2  4)

g = cos2, g+ = g+ = sin2, g++ = cos2.

(2.4)

(2.5)

(2.6)

substituting (2  1) into (2  4) enables us to express x and x+ in terms of x0 and x3 as
follows

x = x0cos + x3sin,

x+ = x0sin  x3cos.

(2.7)

now we notice from (2  5) and (2  6) that if we keep  in the interval 0 < 

employ x as an evolution parameter, whereas in the interval 
as an evolution parameter. thus we expect that xing  to be 
x or x+ as evolution parameters.

2.1. temporal gauge quantization

to construct the temporal gauge formulation in the auxiliary coordinates, we choose
a = a0cos  a3sin = 0 as the gauge xing condition. accordingly we consider the
lagrangian

l =

where f = a   a with  = ( 
x ,
and b is a lagrange multiplier eld. from (2  8) we can derive the eld equations

f f   b(n  a)

x2 ), n = (n, n+, n1, n2) = (1, 0, 0, 0)

(2.8)

f  = 2a  (a) = nb

and the gauge xing condition

the eld equation of b,

a = 0.

b = 0

(2.9)

(2.10)

(2.11)

is obtained by multiplying (2  9) by . lowering the indices of (2  9) and observing that
n = (cos2, sin2, 0, 0) and a = 0 enable us to derive the eld equation of a as

then, dierentiating this by  gives rise to the following equation for a

(a) + cos2b = 0.

(a) = 0.

2


(2.12)

(2.13)

consequently, upon multiplying (2  9) by 2

2(2
a) = 0.


we obtain the following equation for a

(2.15)

from (2  8) we can also obtain the canonical conjugate momenta
b = 0.

+ = f +,

i = f i,

it should be noticed that we have three pairs of canonical variables, in contrast with one
pair in the light-cone temporal gauge formulation. the elds b, a+ and ai (i = 1, 2)
are expressed in terms of canonical variables as follows

b = ++ +

xi=1

a+ = +,

ai =

(2.16)

thus we can impose the following equal-time canonical quantization conditions

[ar(x), as(y)] = 0,

[ar(x), s(y)] = irs(3)(x+  y+),

[r(x), s(y)] = 0

(2.17)

where r, s = +, 1, 2, (3)(x+  y+)(x1  y1)(x2  y2)(x+  y+) and in all cases x = y.
to obtain 4-dimensional commutation relations of a we express a in an integral form.14)
this is done most easily by making use of the commutator function of a free massless eld

d(x) = i

2(2)3 z d3k+

k

(eikx  eikx)

and a commutator function e(x) satisfying the equation

2e(x) = x(3)(x+)ds(x),

2


e(x) = d(x)

and the initial conditions

(2.18)

(2.19)

e(x)|x=0 = 0, e(x)|x=0 = 0, 2


e(x)|x=0 = 0, 2


e(x)|x=0 = (3)(x+).

(2.20)

note that d(x) satises a free massless dalembers equation, which imposes the following
on-shell condition on four momentum k

0 = k2 = n2k2


+ 2sin2k+k  k2

1  k2

2  n2k2

(n2 = cos2).

(2.21)

we solve this in such a way that k is expressed in terms of k1, k2, k+ as follows

where

k =

+ n2k2

k2


k + sin2k+

k = qk2

1 + k2
2,

k = qk2

+ + n2k2


also note that d3k+ denotes dk1dk2dk+ and the integration region of k+ is (, ).

we nd that the function e(x) is given by

e(x) =

e(xz)2a(z)e(xz)2a(z)]

(2.26)

6

where d3z+ denotes dz1dz2dz+. it can easily be shown that the integral form satises the
eld equation 2(2
a) = 0 and is independent of z so that it satises the initial conditions

at z = x. furthermore, we can utilize the latter property to calculate its 4-dimensional
commutation relations using only equal-time canonical commutation relations. it turns out

that

[a(x), a(y)] = i{g d(x y) + (n + n )e(x  y)  n2 e(x y)}. (2.27)
from (2  12), b is expressed as

b = 

(a)

cos2

(2.28)

(2.30)

(2.31)

(2.32)

so the commutation relations of b are obtained from (2  27) as follows

[b(x), a(y)] = i (3)(x+  y+),

[b(x), b(y)] = 0.

(2.29)

2.2. constituent elds in the temporal gauge formulation

to obtain constituent elds in the temporal gauge formulation, we solve the eld equa-
tions (29). we multiply (29) with  = i (i = 1, 2) by i and sum over i = 1, 2. consequently
we obtain

so that (2  9) is rewritten as

a =

2
2


2

iai

xi=1

2(a 


2


2

xi=1

iai) = nb.

because b satises b = 0, any solution of (2  31) is described as

a

2

xi=1

iai = a 

n
+ n22
+

b

2


where a is a homogeneous solution. as a condition that a in (2  32) satises (2  30), we
obtain

a = 0.

(2.33)

furthermore multiplying (2 32) with  = i (i = 1, 2) by i and summing over i = 1, 2 yields
another consistency condition

iai = 0.

2

xi=1

(2.34)

to obtain p2

i=1 iai, we impose the gauge xing condition on (2  32) with  =  and
integrate it with respect to x. it should be noted here that we can introduce a static eld,

7

which we denote c, as an integration constant. for later convenience we introduce it in the
following way

(2.35)

on substituting (2  35) into (2  32) we have

(2.36)

(2.37)

now that we have obtained the constituent elds a, b and c, we proceed to derive the
commutation relations they satisfy. it is straightforward to accomplish if we express them

in terms of the canonical variables as follows

(2.47)

we nd that ar, ar, b, c are fundamental operators, satisfying the following commutation
relations

any other commutators among ar, ar, b or c are zero.

2.3. expression of the constituent elds and implementation of the ml prescription

now we can express the constituent elds in terms of creation and annihilaton operators.
first of all we notice that the free massless eld a+ satises the commutation relation (2 44)
with the operator 2
, which in eect multiplies the integrand of the fourier expanded
free massless elds by (k)2. thus we express a+ in the form

+ +n22


a+(x) = 1

q2(2)3 z d3k+k

k

k{a1(k+)eikx + a1(k+)eikx}.

(2.48)

here the factor 1 is included for later convenience and k+ denotes the three-component
vector(k+, k1, k2). the expression of a is obtained by solving the constraint +a++a =
0 and hence we have

a(x) =

1

q2(2)3 z d3k+k

k+

k{a1(k+)eikx + a1(k+)eikx}.

(2.49)

similarly, because ai satises the constraint p2
(2  45), we have

i=1 iai = 0 and the commutation relation

ai(x) =

1

q2(2)3 z d3k+k

(2)
i (k){a2(k+)eikx + a2(k+)eikx}

(2.50)

where (2)

i (k) is a physical polarization vector given by

(2)
 (k) = (0, 0, 

,

k2
k

k1
k

).

(2.51)

the operators a(k+) and a(k+) ( = 1, 2) are normalized so as to satisfy the usual
commutation relations

[a(k+), a(q+)] = 0,

[a(k+), a(q+)] = (3)(k+  q+).

(2.52)

they are nothing but annihilation and creation operators of physical photons, as we see from
the fact that, with the help of (2  51) and another physical polarization vector

(1)
 (k) = (0, 

k
k

, 

k+k1
kk

, 

k+k2
kk

),

(2.53)

we can express a  



a in the following compact form

a(x) =

let us next determine expressions for b and c. we expand b in terms of conjugate

zero-norm creation and annihilation operators b(k+), b(k+).
in so doing we can realize
gausss law in physical space specied below. similarly, we expand c in terms of conjugate
zero-norm creation and annihilation operators c(k+), c(k+). it seems at rst sight that
there arises no problem in expressing b and c in terms of the zero-norm operators, because
one can employ the following naive expressions for the static elds

b(x) =

c(x) =

where

(2.57)

(2.58)

(2.59)

any other commutators being zero. however, we encounter the problem pointed out by
haller13) , namely the problem that the canonical commutation relations can not distinguish
the pv and ml prescriptions. in fact if we take the k+-integration region to be the whole
interval (,), then we are obliged to have the pv form of propagator. judging from
the fact that the ml form of propagator has to be employed in the light-cone limit and
from indications that the pv form of propagator does not lead to the correct behavior of
the wilson loop in perturbative calculations,15) but the ml form of propagator does,16) we
conclude that the correct form of temporal gauge free theory from which to start perturbative

calculations should perhaps have the ml prescription in the temporal gauge free propagator.
so far extensions of the ml prescription outside the light-cone gauge formulation have been
done by limiting the k+-integration region by hand to be (0,).17)

we solve this problem by introducing an inequivalent fock space. we can rewrite b and
c in such a way that k+-integrations are carried over the interval(0, ) as in the following

b(x) =

1

+ n2k2

(k+)(k2


+){b(k+)eikx + b(k+)eikx}x=0,

q(2)3 z d3k+k+
q(2)3 z d3k+(k+)qk+{c(k+)eikx  c(k+)eikx}x=0

i

c(x) =

(2.60)

(2.61)

10

where

b(k+) =

c(k+) =

b(k+) + b(k+)

c(k+)  c(k+)

2

, b(k+) =

, c(k+) =

b(k+) + b(k+)

2

c(k+)  c(k+)

2

,

.

(2.62)

(2.63)

now we see that b(k+) and c(k+) are nothing but canonical transformations, which are
generated as follows

b(k+) = eb(k+)e, b(k+) = eb(k+)e,

c(k+) = ec(k+)e, c(k+) = ec(k+)e

(2.64)

(2.65)

where

 =



4 z d3k+(k+){b(k+)c(k+)  b(k+)c(k+)  b(k+)c(k+) + b(k+)c(k+)}.

(2.66)

thus, if we dene the physical vacuum state | > by
| >= e|0 >

where |0 > is the bare vacuum state satisfying

then it is easy to show that

b(k+)|0 >= c(k+)|0 >= 0,

b(k+)| >= c(k+)| >= 0.

thus physical space vp is dened by

vp = { |phys > | b(k+)|phys >= 0 }.

(2.67)

(2.68)

(2.69)

(2.70)

in this way we can always obtain the ml prescription in the physical space. to be complete
we note that the x-ordered propagator

d(x  y) =< |{(x  y)a(x)a(y) + (y  x)a(y)a(x)}| >

(2.71)

results in the ml form of propagator as follows

d(x  y) =

1

(2)4 z d4kd(k)eik(xy)

where

d(k) =

i

k2 + i{g +

nk + n k

k + isgn(k+)

(k + isgn(k+))2}.

(2.72)

(2.73)

11

it is known that for interacting theories the ml form of propagator has to be employed in
the light-cone limit(  
4 ). therefore it is interesting to investigate whether it is also true
of the  = 0 case, that is to say, the temporal gauge formulation in the ordinary space-time
coordinates.

translation generators p = r d3x+t  (x) are given in terms of the creation and annihi-

(2.75)

we close this section by making two remarks. first, that the heisenberg equation of c

is not satised, as is seen from

[p, c(x)] = in2b(x)

but that this is necessary to assure the heisenberg equations of a

[p, a(x)] = ia(x).

(2.76)

(2.77)

second, that we have not attempted constructing the axial gauge formulation in the auxiliary
coordinates. this is because we have not succeeded in nding any solutions other than (236).
it seems to us that (2  36) is not an appropriate solution in the axial gauge formulation
because x is included explicitly and because the inverse laplace operator
becomes
singular.

3. light-cone gauge quantizations in the light-front coordinates
in this section we conne ourselves to the  = 

4 case, namely, to the formulation in the
light-front coordinates x = (x, x+, x1, x2) = ( x0x3
, x1, x2) ) with metric tensors
2
dened by

, x0+x3

g11 = g22 = g11 = g22 = 1,
g+ = g+ = g+ = g+ = 1,
all other components = 0.

(3.1)

) to avoid inessential complications, in this section we omit the sux l denoting quantities in the

light-front coordinates and use the same notation as that used in sect.2 .

12

first of all we recall that the lagrangian (2  8) becomes singular in the light-front
coordinates, where n = (0, 1, 0, 0). in fact in the temporal gauge formulation with x
being the evolution parameter, it happens that the canonical momenta i conjugate to ai
becomes noninvertible, as we seen from

 = 0, + = a+, i = +ai  ia+, (i = 1, 2), b = 0.

(3.2)

what is worse, in the axial gauge formulation with x+ being the evolution parameter, all
momenta become noninvertible as in the following

 = a+, + = 0, i = ai, (i = 1, 2), b = 0.

(3.3)

as to the temporal case, we can circumvent dealing with the constrained system because
we can obtain canonically quantized free electromagnetic elds by simply taking the limit
  
4  0 of (2  36). as to the axial case, we can not follow the same approach because we
have not succeeded in nding an appropriate axial gauge solution in the auxiliary coordinates.
nevertheless, we expect to get the axial light-front limit(  
4 + 0) from the temporal light-
front limit(  
4  0). as a matter of fact, known light-cone gauge solutions are equivalent
to each other, which is seen below.

in the temporal light-front limit n2 = cos2 becomes zero and the mass-shell condition
of the free massless elds is changed into 2kk+  k2
= 0 so that the range of k+-integration

is reduced to (0,) in the fourier expansions of the free massless elds. consequently we
obtain the following electromagnetic elds described in terms of the constituent elds

a = a

we see immediately that (3  4) is identical with one given by mccartor and robertson
and by morara and soldati and is equivalent to the one given by bassetto et al. actually,
the physical annihilation and creation operators a(k) and a(k) in the ordinary space-time
coordinates are identied with those in the light-front coordinates by

a(k) = s k+

k0

a(k+),

a(k) = s k+

k0

a(k+), ( = 1, 2).

(3.10)

consequently our a 
a can be identied with t in the latter by changing the integration
variable from k+ into k3. in addition our b and c can be identied with  and u respectively
in the latter if we identify our k+ with k3 in the latter.



let us enumerate the properties of a in (3  4).

(1) it satises the following 4-dimensional commutation relations

[a(x), a(y)] = i{g d(x  y) + (n + n)e(x  y)},

(2) it satises the following light-cone temporal gauge quantization conditions:

[a+(x), a+(y)]|x=y = [a+(x), ai(y)]|x=y = 0, (i = 1, 2)
ij(+)1(3)(x+  y+), (i, j = 1, 2)

let us next investigate whether the properties of the light-cone axial gauge formulation
are satised by (3  4) or not. first we examine whether or not the light-cone axial gauge
quantization conditions are satised by carefully evaluating the commutation relations (311)
at x+ = y+. it will suce to evaluate the commutator function e(x), which is rewritten
as

(3.22)

note that the rst and the second terms result from the ghost and physical elds respectively
and that they are ill-dened individually. it is shown in appendix a that i(x, x+) is given
by

i(x, x+) =



2{1 + (x)(x+)}vuut

kj1(q2|x+x| k)
where j1(x) is the bessel function of order 1. from (3  23) we obtain

(3.24)

it follows that

(3.26)

furthermore the commutator[ai(x), aj(y)]|x+=y+ is evaluated to be
[ai(x), aj(y)]|x+=y+ = iijd(xy)|x+=y+ = 
we see that these commutation relations agree with those given by diracs canonical quan-
tization procedure except the rst term of (3 26), which results from the fact that i(x, x+)
has a nite discontinuity at x+ = 0.

note that b and c are zero-norm elds so they have nonvanishing contributions for three
cases, namely for  = +,  = i;  = i,  = + and  =  = +. in case that  = i and  = j

there arises no problem and we have

d+

ij(q) =

(3.31)

as was noticed by morara and soldati,11) the second term diverges linearly. this implies
that if the ghost elds really regularize d+
++(x  y), a linear divergence has to appear from
the physical contribution so as to be canceled. as a matter of fact we see that if we rewrite

the physical contribution as

(3.34)

to the best of our knowledge this point has been overlooked so far. we verify in appendix
b that linear divergences do not appear from d+
++(x) if we carry out k+-integrations of the

16

physical and ghost contributions simultaneously and in advance of fourier transformation
with respect x+. this veries that the linear divergences arising from the ghost and physi-
cal contributions cancel each other. therefore, although changing the order of integrations
prevents us from carrying out the fourier transformations to obtain a closed form expres-
sion for d+
++(q), we are justied in neglecting the linear divergence arising from the ghost
contribution as follows

d+

++(q) =

(3.35)

here the nite contact term is obtained as a result of fourier transformation of |x|. the
appearance of contact terms implies the existence of coulomb-like counter terms in the
interaction hamiltonian. we leave the specication of such terms for subsequent studies.

4. concluding remarks

in this paper we have analyzed further the problem of the canonical derivation of the

propagator in gauge theories, both in the light-cone representation and in the equal-time
representation. we have emphasized the indispensability of ghost elds in the light-cone

gauge formulation of gauge elds.
in particular, we have found that the ghost elds are
indispensable if we are to have well-dened antiderivatives and to properly regularize the

most singular component of the naive gauge eld propagator. we have also shown that the
ml form of propagator is obtained in a consistent temporal gauge formulation of gauge elds

in the ordinary space-time coordinates if a suitable vacuum is chosen.

what we have not completely understood is the discrepancy observed in the commutator
[a+(x), a+(y)]|x+=y+, in which we nd an extra (x+  y+)-type singularity. it seems that
this discrepancy indicates that the light-cone limits are not the same and that the light-cone

axial gauge formulation will require the elimination of such singularities. we have also left
completing the fourier transform of the (formally) most singular component of the gauge

eld propagator for subsequent studies.

finally we point out that our approach may provide an easier way to construct perturba-

tion theories of interacting gauge elds in the light-cone temporal gauge than that of morara
and soldati11) , because temporal gauge lagrangians are regular in the auxiliary coordinates.
we also leave this task for subsequent studies.

verication of (3  24)

with the help of the addition theorem of the trigonometric cosine function, we can

decompose i(x, x+) as a sum of two well-dened integrals

we see that i (1)(x, x+) is an odd function of x+ and of x and becomes trivially zero at
x+ = 0 and/or at x = 0. we also see that in the case that x+ > 0 and x > 0, an explicit
expression of i (1)(x, x+) is known from an integral formula18)

because of the sign factor (x+), i (1)(x, x+) gives a nite discontinuity at x+ = 0.

next we show that an explicit expression for i (2)(x, x+), which is an even function of
x and of x+, results from the same formula (a 4). in case that x+6=0, integrating by parts
and then changing integration variable from k+ to k = k2

which turns out to be the limit of (a  6) as x+  0. consequently i (2)(x, x+) is known to
be a continuous function of x and x+. substituting (a  5) and (a  6) into (a  1) yields
(3  24).

and i(x, x+) is the function given in appendix a. we see that owing to the second term,
which comes from the ghost contribution, the integrand of j(x, x+) behaves like cosk+x+
as
k+  , which veries that j(x, x+) is well-dened when x+6=0.

it is useful to illustrate how the ghost contribution gives rise to a linear divergence.

we see that the last term diverges linearly. furthermore we notice that showing that
j(x, x+) does not possess any terms tending to 1
x+ as x+0 veries the disappearance
of linear divergences from d+
++(x). note that i(x, x+) has no such terms, as is seen from
(3  25).

where a > 0, b > 0,|re| < 1 and k, j and n are bessel functions. we are justied in
using the limits to calculate j(x, x+), because j(x, x+) is decomposed as a dierence of
the two integrations and because the dierence is well-dened so that it is independent of
the regularizations. in the limit we have
