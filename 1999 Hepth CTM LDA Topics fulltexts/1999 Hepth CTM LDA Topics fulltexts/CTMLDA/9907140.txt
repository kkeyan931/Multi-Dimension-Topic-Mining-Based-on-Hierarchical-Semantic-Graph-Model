appropriate non-perturbative tests duality conjectures. however, picture d-branes drastically changed last year half. may observed {$9803194$} spectrum superstring theory contain states bps property, nevertheless stable lightest states theory carry given set conserved quantum numbers prevent 3 decaying. stable non-bps states studied using standard string perturbation theory properties determined

{$9503124$} (for instance, induced boundary homomorphism trivial mapping, ker = n1(g/h), n1(g/h) = n1(g)/n1(h)). coupling (1.1) would seem imply that, since massless rr elds c (p+1) dierential forms, rr charges d-branes determined cohomology classes, i.e. integrating c (p+1) suitable cycles spacetime manifold x. however, new interpretation d-brane charge topological charge actually suggests

applications general formalism k-theory string theory m-theory. let abelian monoid, i.e. set addition satises axioms group except possibly existence inverse. one naturally associate abelian group s(a) following construction. consider equivalence relation cartesian product monoid (e, f ) (e, f ) exists element g e + f + g = f + e + g . (2.1) abelian group s(a), called symmetrization a, dened set equivalence classes pairs: s(a) = a/ . (2.2) equivalence class pair (e, f ) denoted  inverse element s(a) . follows fact e a,  representative zero element s(a). alternative denition s(a) obtained using equivalence relation (e, f ) (e, f ) exist g, h (e, f ) + (g, g) = (e, f ) + (h, h) . (2.3) simple example, = z+ (the non-negative integers addition), s(a) = z. also, = z {0} (an abelian monoid multiplication), s(a) = q {0}. completion s(a) monoid characterized following universal property. abelian group g, homomorphism f : g underlying monoids, exists unique homomorphism f : s(a) g f = f , natural map s(a) dened s(e) = . means s(a) smallest abelian group built abelian monoid implies, 12 particular, group, s(a) = a. general, property implies map s(a) covariant functor category abelian monoids : b homomorphism monoids, category abelian groups, i.e. unique group homomorphism s() : s(a) s(b) following diagram commutative: b (2.4) s(a) s() s(b) s( ) = s() s(), s(ida) = ids(a) (here ida denotes identity morphism a). important example construction applies case c additive category (c) set isomorphism classes elements e c, denote . (c) becomes abelian monoid dene  +   (this well-dened since isomorphism class ef depends isomorphism classes e f ). grothendieck group c dened k(c) = s((c)). note every element k(c) written formal dierence     =   k(c) exists g c e f g = e f g. notice also  =  g c e g = f g. simple example, let f algebraic eld (e.g. f = r c), let c category nite dimensional vector spaces f whose morphisms linear transformations. then, since nite dimensional vector spaces characterized uniquely dimension, (c) = z+ implying k(c) = z. 2.2 group k(x) use construction previous subsection classication vector bundles compact manifolds. let x compact manifold let c = vect(x) additive category complex vector bundles x respect bundle morphisms whitney sum (later shall also consider real quaternionic vector bundles). dene k trivial bundle rank k x, i.e. k = x ck. space vector bundles partitioned equivalence classes follows. bundle e x said stably equivalent bundle f , denoted e f , exists positive integers j, k e j = f k . (2.5) 13 corresponding equivalence classes vect(x)/ called stable equivalence classes. easily seen e, f g vector bundles x e g = f g e f , (2.6) i.e. e f stably equivalent. proof one uses fact exists bundle g g g trivial (according swans theorem requires x compact hausdor manifold). however, one cannot conclude left-hand side (2.6) e f isomorphic vector bundles. example, consider e = sn, tangent bundle n-sphere sn, g = n(sn, rn+1), normal bundle sn rn+1. g global section given outward-pointing unit normal vector, implies trivial n(sn, rn+1) = 1. furthermore, usual relations n+1 = rn+1 = e g = e 1 . (2.7) however, e = sn generally trivial therefore equal n (in fact sn trivial parallelizable spheres corresponding n = 1, 3, 7). generally, sn stably trivial. example demonstrates space vector bundles x group whitney sum vector bundles, rather monoid, subtraction dened vector bundles. group can, using previous setup, constructed follows. k-group compact manifold x dened grothendieck group category vect(x), k(x) k(vect(x)), k(x) = vect(x) vect(x)/ , (2.8) dened equivalence relation vect(x)vect(x) according (e, f ) (e, f ) exists vector bundle g vect(x) e f g = e f g .
