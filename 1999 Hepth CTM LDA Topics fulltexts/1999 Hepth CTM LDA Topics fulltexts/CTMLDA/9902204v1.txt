properties of the dirac-born-infeld lagrangian analogous to those
of the nambu-goto string are analysed. in particular the lagrangian
is shown to be constant or zero on the space of solutions of the equa-
tions of motion if the lagrangian is taken to any power other than

1 introduction

it is well known that, at a classical level, the schild lagrangian for strings [2],
which is the square of the nambu-goto lagrangian which itself is a measure
of the area swept out by the string, has equations of motion which are a subset
of those arising in the latter case. there is, however another constraint in the
case of the schild action; the lagrangian is a constant or zero on the space
of solutions. this property is not a requirement for the nambu-goto string,
which therfore possesses a wider class of solutions. the question arises as
to whether there is something special about the two-dimensional nature of
the world sheet, or whether lagrangians, analogous to the schild case can be
constructed in the case of the dirac1 -born-infeld lagrangian, which pertains
to the motion of d-branes[1][4] [3]. indeed there is; the equations of motion
for any function of the dirac-born-infeld lagrangian will always be the same
at the classical level. this property follows from the following result; the
gradient of the lagrangian in any direction within the world volume is zero on
the space of solutions of the equations of motion for this lagrangian whenever
it is taken to any power other than the square root. this is analogous to the
statement for strings that longitudinal and timelike variations have no eect.
in the special case of the square root lagrangian itself, the conclusion that the
gradient vanishes is evaded and the requirement that the lagrangian should
be a constant on the space of solutions is not mandatory. the most signicant
consequence of the reparametrisation invariance is that the conserved stress
tensor vanishes as does that for the string, or self dual yang mills.

this characteristic of integrable systems, and suggests that the born -
infeld theory may be at least partially tractable in any dimension. the
dirac-born-infeld lagrangian l describes a mapping of the coordinates xj
of a world volume of dimension n embedded in a total space of dimension d,
co-ordinatised by x (xj). an abelian gauge eld fi,j =

world volume is included in the description, but additional terms of chern-
simons type and supersymmetric terms are neglected. the lagrangian den-

the action from this lagrangian is re-parametrisation invariant [5] with re-

then it is easy to see that

in other words l scales with the jacobian of the transformation. note that
this transformation is compatible with gauge transformations on aj. this
invariance is also obviously compatible with the gradient conditions which
states that

for any non trivial function of the lagrangian. in the next two section the
proofs of these assertions about the gradient law and the stress tensor will
be given. for simplicity, the metric on the world volume will be taken to be
euclidean, but this is not essential. other recent approaches to the classical
treatment of the dirac-born-infeld lagrangian may be found in references
[5][6][7].

first of all, a reminder of how the result works for strings.

let l(,  ) be the schild lagrangian

we want to show that the equations of motion from l = l are included

classically in those from l

consider the equation of motion

now multiply this by x

now if instead, the equations of motion are sought which follow from lp,
taking as lagrangian an arbitrary power, we obtain

a similar manipulation to that above, by multiplying (11) by x

and the last two terms vanish on account of (10) when the equations of motion
for l are satised. hence the equations of motion from lp are satised
whenever the equations of motion from l are for any p. however, in the
case of the square root lagrangian l the deduction that l
 both
vanish and that hence l is necessarily constant, or zero when the equations
of motion are satised cannot be drawn. this argument clearly also works
in higher dimensions.the key result is that n  l vanishes for all vectors
n lying in the tangent space to the world surface whenever the equations
of motion for l are satised. the inclusion of an abelian eld fij into the
lagrangian makes no essential dierence to this argument. the proof follows
along similar lines, as follows. take now

(20)

as a consequence of the fact that

l

is antisymmetric in j, k. thus the

derivative of l with respect to any of the world volume co-ordinates vanishes
on the space of solutions to the equations of motion it is easy to see that
these conditions imply that the same equation of motion results from taking
any dierentiable function of l as a lagrangian.

3 l as the sum of quadratic terms

all these higher dimensional lagrangians share a common property with the
lagrangian for a free particle; namely that l, given by (14) can be expressed
as the sum of quadratic terms. the easiest way to explain this result is
to consider the case where the dimensions of the world volume dimensions
n, = 4. then l is the determinant

this expression shows the pattern; the individual terms may be expressed as
the contraction of an epsilon symbol with factors of the form x 
,or else fij,

where now the derivative acts on everything to the right, taking into account
all possible terms. it is the analogue of the relativistic particle lagrangian

q x 



x 
 . this expression may be written more succinctly as

m m ,

l = xm

(23)

where the important property of the determinants m is that they are all
expressible as divergences. this means that the equations of motion for x 
(and similarly for ai) take the form

4 the stress tensor.

another remarkable property of the lagrangian l is that the associated stress
tensor automatically vanishes. a gauge invariant stress tensor, tij for l is
given by

tij =

the last step follows from the determinantal identities. this tensor is purely
diagonal, and divergencless as a consequence of the conditions (19). when

7

the lagrangian l = l is used the terms above cancel and even the diagonal

components vanish! this is a consequence of the reparametrisation invariance
of the theory.

5 discussion

the three properties of the dirac-born-infeld lagrangian, dieomorphism
covariance, vanishing gradients on the world volume for generic lagrangians
and vanishing stress tensor are obviously inter-related. the vanishing of the
stress tensor is in fact a consequence of reparametrisation invariance. these
properties are, of course, well known in the special case of the nambu-goto
string. this fact, together with the circumstance that the stress tensor for
yang mills in 4-dimensions vanishes on instanton solutions, strongly suggests
that the dirac-born-infeld theory may be more tractable than has been hith-
erto suspected. one may ask why the gradient property has apparently not
been noticed before. a possible answer is that in most treatments the induced

x

x

metric gij =

is split into contributions from the world volume, by

setting x i = xi together with contributions from the transverse space, before
evaluating the equations of motion, i.e.

gij = ij +

x=n+1

.

(26)

the derivation given here more closely parallels the standard treatment of
the string, where the co-ordinate choice is not made until after the equations
of motion are derived. an interesting mathematical question arises from this
work. it is well known, [8] that the schild action may be regarded as the
n   limit of yang mills in strong coupling with gauge group su(n).
what is the corrresponding nite n version of the dirac-born-infeld theory?
