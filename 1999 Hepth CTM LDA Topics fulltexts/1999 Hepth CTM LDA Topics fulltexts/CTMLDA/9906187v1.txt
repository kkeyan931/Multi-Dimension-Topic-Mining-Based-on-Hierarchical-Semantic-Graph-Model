abstract

we analyse an integrable model of two-dimensional gravity which can be
reduced to a pair of liouville elds in conformal gauge. its general solution rep-
resents a pair of mirror black holes with the same temperature. the ground
state is a degenerate constant dilaton conguration similar to the nariai solution
of the schwarzschild-de sitter case. the existence of  = const. solutions and
their relation with the solution given by the 2d birkhoffs theorem is then inves-
tigated in a more general context. we also point out some interesting features
of the semiclassical theory of our model and the similarity with the behaviour of
ads2 black holes.

1 introduction

the existence of exactly solvable models of gravity in two dimensions [1] provides
a rich arena for the study of quantum aspects of black holes. these two-dimensional
black holes, in addition to their own interest, can describe particular regimes of higher-
dimensional black holes. the cghs model [2] describes low-energy excitations of
extremal (magnetic) string black holes in four dimensions. ads2 black holes arise in
the near-horizon limits of extremal or near-extremal reissner-nordstrom black holes
[3, 4]. by dimensional reduction, spherically symmetric gravity can also be described
in terms of an effective two-dimensional model.

the aim of this paper is to analyse a general family of integrable models [5] which
can recover all known solvable models (cghs [2], jackiw-teitelboim [6] and expo-
nential (liouville) [7] models) in some particular limits. the equations of motion of
the models, in conformal gauge, are equivalent to those of a pair of liouville elds
for linear combinations of the conformal factor and the dilaton eld. these properties
will be briey reviewed in section 2. in section 3 we investigate the properties of the
classical solutions showing that, in the absence of matter elds, they represent a pair of
eternal black holes. in section 4 we shall focus in one particular model (with a potential
of the form v () = 2 sinh ) which allows a degenerate solution having a constant
value for the dilaton and a two-dimensional de sitter (or anti-de sitter, depending on
the sign of the constant ) geometry. the situation is similar to that encountered in
the schwarzschild-de sitter case where the degenerate case of the nariai metric [8] is
also described by a constant dilaton (i.e. the radial coordinate). in section 5 we shall
analyse the existence of such dilaton-constant solutions in a more general setting. we
will show in a simple way that these congurations are possible for the zeros of the
potential, after removing the kinetic term of the two-dimensional dilaton-gravity the-
ory, and are always accompanied by a constant curvature geometry. furthemore, they
are always connected with the presence of degenerate horizons in the theory. finally,
in section 6 we make some comments on the semiclassical behaviour of our solutions
and show interesting similarities with the behaviour of ads2 black holes.

2 integrability of 2d dilaton gravity models

let us consider the general functional action describing a 2d dilaton gravity model
coupled to n 2d massless and minimal scalar elds

s =

1

2z d2xg r + 42v ()

(fi)2! ,

n

xi=1

(1)

where v () is an arbitrary function of the dilaton eld and fi are the scalar matter
elds. the above expression represents a generic model because one can get rid of the

1

kinetic term of the dilaton by a conformal reparametrization of the elds and bring the
action into the form (1) [9]. in conformal gauge ds2 = e2dx+dx, the equations of
motion derived from the action (1) are

2+ + 2v ()e2 = 0 ,
+ + 2v ()e2 = 0 ,
+fi = 0 ,

 2

 + 2 

(fi)2 = 0 .

by introducing an arbitrary parameter  we can rewrite the above equations of motion
(2), (3) in the form

+(2  )  2e2(cid:18)v () 

dv ()

d (cid:19) = 0 ,
d (cid:19) = 0 .

(7)

one way to ensure the integrability of the above equations is to reduce them to a pair
of liouville equations [5]. the most general potential satisfying this requirement is

v () = +e + e ,

so that the corresponding equations of motion are a pair of liouville equations

+(2  )  22e2 = 0 .

(8)

(9)

this potential includes all known integrable models. that is, for  = 1
the cghs model; + =  = 1
+ = 1,  = 0 the exponential (liouville) model [10].

and allows to recover the general solution of the limiting models. the solution for the
exponential model is immediately recovered making + = 1 and  = 0 in (10), (11).

in the jackiw-teitelboim theory (+ =  = 1

the above mechanism provides a very simple picture on the origin of the integra-
bility of these models and suggests a particular analysis of the most general integrable
hyperbolic model (8). the hidden reason of this integrability can now be understood
as all them are particular cases of a general liouville integrability of which the hyper-
bolic model is, in a sense, the maximal one. the hyperbolic model is then the most
complicated solvable model that we can study.

3 classical theory and eternal black hole solutions

in this section we shall study the classical theory of the model (8) and look for black
hole solutions. the functional action is given by

s =

and we have to note that, although one of the three parameters , +,  is redundant,
we shall maintain all of them in order to simplify the equations.

the solutions to the unconstrained equations of motion of the above theory are
given by (10) and (11). now, in terms of the a, a functions the constraint equations
(5) become

(18)

(19)

where the parameter c is related with the conserved quantity m (proportional to the
adm mass)

in a pure two-dimensional context and in order to study the full spacetime structure
of the solution we will place no restriction on the range of variation of the eld .
of course, if our starting point were four dimensional the identication of  with the
radius of the two-sphere r would imply that only  > 0 is allowed. the curvature of
the solution is

r = 42 +

(21)

(22)

(23)

in order to avoid timelike singularities we have two possibilities:  < 0, + > 0,  <
0, or  > 0, + < 0,  > 0. they are actually the same because the potential (8) is
symmetric under the interchange of both cases. the kruskal diagram is represented in

it is interesting to note that we do not lose generality by restricting to the case  = 1.

in fact, even if we consider  6= 1 the redenitions e  e and 2  2

recast the potential in the  = 1 form. moreover, the constant shift in the eld  will
produce an extra piece in the action proportional to r, but this, being just a boundary
term, does not affect the equations of motion. we then consider the following potential

this model is interesting due to the presence of a dilaton-constant solution. the curva-
ture has generically two singularities at points (22), (23) (+ =  = 1). however,
in the limit c  2 it becomes regular and constant everywhere and the dilaton
eld is constant e = 1. the similarity of this solution with a known one in einstein
gravity will be explored in the next section.

4 degenerate horizon solutions and comparison with

the schwarzschild-de sitter case

in this section we shall study the particular  = 0 solution of the model (25) because
it has a special similarity with the nariai solution appearing in the schwarzschild-de

5

sitter solution [11, 12]. the schwarzschild-de sitter metric is the static spherically
symmetric solution of the einstein equations with a cosmological constant . it is

where

ds2 =  u (r)dt2 + u (r)1dr2 + r2d2 ,

u (r) = 1

(30)

(31)

2 , u(r) has two positive roots corresponding to the black hole and
for 0 < m < 1
cosmological horizons. but in the limit m  1
2 the two roots coincide and the
horizons apparently merge. in this degenerate case the schwarzschild coordinates be-
come inappropriate since u(r)  0 between the two horizons. according to ginsparg
and perry [12] we can dene new coordinates  and

r =

(32)

(33)

(34)

which turns out to be the nariai solution.

ds2 = 

(cid:0)sin2 d2  d2(cid:1) +

1


d2 ,

a similar situation is found in the model (25). to see this feature we consider the
static solution (we call this the schwarzschild gauge) that the 2d birkhoffs theorem
[13] provides for a generic model (1). this solution is written as

ds2 = (4j()  4m)dt2 + (4j()  4m)1dr2 ,
 = r ,

where

m = j() 

1
42 ()2

(35)
(36)

(37)

is a diffeomorphism invariant parameter related with the adm mass and j() =
0 d v ( ).
for the model (25) we get the following metric

r 

where

ds2 = u(r)dt2 + u(r)1dr2 ,

u(r) =

8


(cosh r  1)  4m .

(38)

(39)

6

if we consider  < 0, m  0 solutions, there are two horizons (u(r) = 0) located at
(40)

arcosh(1 +

m) ,

r = 

1


1
2

but in the limit m  0 the horizons become coincident (r = 0) and u(r)  0
between them. there are two curvature singularities at r =  since the curvature is
(41)

r = 82 cosh r .

we can interpret this solution as two mirror black holes located at innity hidden
by two horizons r. the space-time between the horizons admits a timelike killing
vector (u(r) > 0), which becomes spacelike behind the horizons (u(r) < 0). in the
limit m  0 the horizons coalesce and in this region u(r)  0,   0, r  82.
in this limit the (t, r) coordinates become inappropriate and we need to perform a co-
ordinate change.

if we dene a parameter c so that m is written as (28) the m  0 limit is recov-

ered in the c  2 limit. thus let us try the following transformation

 x+x =

x+
x = e( 

2

c  2er
)t ,

c  c

,

(42)

(43)

relating both kruskal and schwarzschild gauges as it brings (38), (39), (36) into (26),
(27) respectively. this transformation is singular for the degenerate case c = 2
(m = 0) as the ginsparg-perry one for the 4d schwarzschild-de sitter gravity [12].
we can actually see it as a perturbation around the point r = 0 where both horizons
coincide. when c = 2 there are no singularities and the metric (26) turns into

ds2 =

dx+dx

(1 + 2x+x)2

and, nally, the new transformation

x =

1



(sinh   cosh )

sin 

1 + cos 

brings it into the 2d-reduced part of the nariai solution [8] with topology h 2

ds2 = 1
42

( sin2 d2 + d2) .

(44)

(45)

(46)

note that even though the transformation (42), (43) is singular for the degenerate
case, the coordinates x remain appropriate for this case too and the horizons radii

7

also remain different. the true reason for which this transformation becomes singu-
lar in the limit c  2 is due to the fact that both kruskal gauge (constant dila-
ton) and schwarzschild gauge (linear dilaton) solutions are not diffeomorphism con-
nected. they are indeed two different solutions and this motivates a revision of the 2d
birkhoffs theorem which will be made in the next section.

to nish this section we shall consider the thermodynamics of this model. since
the static schwarzschild gauge (38) is not the appropriate one to study the thermody-
namics due to the degenerate limit we look for another one starting from the conformal-
kruskal gauge (26). this is possible since the model always admits a timelike killing
vector. thus let us introduce new static coordinates y given by

where 2 = c. in terms of these coordinates the metric becomes

 x = ey

,

ds2 =

dt2 + dy2
c )2 + 42

c cosh2 y

(1  2

.

(47)

(48)

the metric is manifestly static in this form and it is straightforward to nd a new
schwarzschild-type gauge by means of the new spacelike coordinates dened by

 =

1
c )(1  2
(1 + 2
c )

arctanh"(1  2

c )
(1 + 2
c )

tanh y# .

the new schwarzschild-type metric is then

ds2 = u()dt2 +

d2
u()

(49)

(50)

where

u() =

the horizons u() = 0 are

.

(51)

(52)

in these coordinates we can study the degenerate case c = 2 since they will still be
able to see the region between the horizons. in this limit the solution becomes

u() =

1  (4)2

4

8

(53)

and the horizons still remain uncoincident

 = 

1
4

.

(54)

to get the horizon temperature we should construct the euclidean metric setting
it =  and identifying  with an appropriate period in order to remove the singularities.
but this is not so in this case because the killing vector cannot be normalized at innity
as in the standard schwarzschild case, due to the presence of the singularities. bousso
and hawking [14] give the correct prescription. we need to nd the point g for which
the orbit of the killing vector coincides with the geodesic going through g. in such
a point the effects of both black holes attractions balance out exactly and an observer
will need no acceleration (
 = 0) to stay there, just like an observer at innity in
the standard schwarzschild case. a straightforward calculation shows that this point is
just where both horizons coincide in the degenerate case (r = 0), that is g = 0. with
the adequate normalization the horizon temperatures are given by [14]

t =

.

(55)

(56)

(57)

and then we get

and in the c  2 limit

note that the horizon temperatures are always coincident in either non-degenerate or
degenerate case in a different way from the 4d schwarzschild-de sitter case. we can
then complete the physical picture of this model, the two mirror black holes are at the
same temperature. this feature will have some important consequences on the semi-
classical theory as we will see later.

finally we have to note that the transformation (47) is performed in the region
between the horizons x+x < 0. we can realize a new transformation in order to take
into account the black hole interiors x+x > 0

x = ey

.

in this case the static metric is

brings the metric into the same geometry (50), (51) so that there is no difference from
the last one as expected.

we now wish to comment briey on the case  > 0 where the physical picture is
completely different, i.e. the singularities are timelike and in the region between the
horizons the killing vector is spacelike . the kruskal diagram is similar to that of a
point electric charge in 2+1 dimensions [15]. formally, the analysis of this section
can be repeated step by step for this solution as well. when the two horizons become
degenerate there is again a ginsparg-perry type transformation connecting the constant
(now negative) curvature,  = 0 solution with (38), (39), in much the same the way as
it has been done in [16] for the 2d dilaton-maxwell gravity.

5 the 2d birkhoffs theorem revisited

now we analyse the existence of dilaton-constant solutions in a more general context.
this feature leads us to perform a revision of the 2d birkhoffs theorem. under some
assumptions one can ensure that the general solution is given, up to space-time dif-
femorphisms, by a one-parameter family of static metrics [13]. the parameter, related
with the adm mass, is diffeomorphism invariant and classies all of them. in partic-
ular, there exists a schwarzschild gauge in which the solution is manifestly static and
the dilaton eld is linear in the space-like coordinate.
considering the gravitational sector of (1)

s =

1

2z d2xg(cid:0)r + 42v ()(cid:1) ,

this solution is written as (35), (36), where m, given by (37), is the diffeomorphism
invariant parameter. we shall show that there is also another type of solutions. for
certain potentials there is, in fact, another static solution providing a constant curvature
space with a constant dilaton eld. the equations of motion (2), (3) of the above
functional action in a static gauge 

t (where x = t  x) are

(61)

(62)

(63)

(64)

if d

dx 6= 0 the equation (63) admits a rst integral

where m is an integration constant and, using the constraints, the equation (62) turns
into

.

(65)

d

e2 =

the equation (64) gives the conformal factor e2 = 4j()4m and in the schwarzschild
gauge, dened by dr = e2dx, we get nally the set (35), (36). this is essentially the
birkhoffs theorem [13]. now we are going to consider the d
dx = 0 case, that is,
dilaton-constant solutions.  this kind of solutions  = 0 can only exist for certain
potentials v () satisfying

so that the equation (63) is trivially satised and (62) becomes

v (0) = 0 ,

dv ()

d (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)0 6= 0 ,

where

(66)

(67)

(68)

r0 = 42 dv

= const .

d(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)0

thus these solutions lead to constant curvature spacetimes. making the coordinate
change dr = e2dx into the schwarzschild gauge the equation (67) is easily integrated
and the solution is written as

ds2 = (k 
 = 0 = const ,

r0
2

r2)dt2 + (k

r2)1dr2 ,

(69)

(70)

where k is an integration constant.
obviously both solutions (35), (36) and (69), (70) are not diffeomorphism connected
as it is manifested by the scalar dilaton function. note that this last dilaton-constant
solution is not available for a generic potential v () but only for those satisfying the
conditions (66). one example is the sinh  potential (25); another one is provided in
appendix a starting from einstein-maxwell gravity in 4d. in conformal gauge, in the
special limit c  2, we obtained the dilaton-constant ( = 0) solution (44) with
m = 0 and constant curvature r = r0 = 82. in a manifestly static gauge, it
reads
(71)
but  = 0 is just the dilaton-constant solution for the sinh  potential: v (0) = 0,
dv ()

ds2 = (1 + 42r2)dt2 + (1 + 42r2)1dr2 .

d (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)0 6= 0 and moreover j(0) = 0 so that the expression (37) becomes identically

zero. the above solution coincides with (69) (with k = 1). now we can complete
our understanding on the c  2 limit of the solution (26), (27) in kruskal gauge.
the c 6= 2 case coincides, up to diffeomorphisms, with the m 6= 0 parametrized
solution (35), (36) and the c = 2 case with the unparametrized solution (69), (70).
these solutions are different and they cannot be diffeomorphism connected. the spe-
cial case m = 0 in (35), (36), which at rst sight we could be tempted to identify with

the existence of these kind of solutions was already noted in [17].

11

(69), (70), is the horizon coincident case and the region i of fig. i is reduced to the
point r = 0 where  = 0 and r = 82. the transformation (42), (43) connects
both gauges in a similar way to the ginsparg-perry one and this suggests that there is
a deep relation between the existence of constant dilaton solutions and horizon degen-
eration. in fact this is what happens in general and we shall show this in the remaining
part of this section.

let us consider again the general solution (35), (36) for a general potential v ()
and introduce u(r) = 4j(r)  4m so that the horizons are the roots of u(r). in order
to study models with horizon degeneration we want u(r) to have two or more roots.
although all roots are distinct we can always t a value m0 of the parameter m for
which two neighbouring roots become coincident in, say, r0 which is then a double
root of u(r). the critical value of m is m0 = j(r0) and the dilaton function at this
point is 0 = r0. now, since r0 is an extremal of u(r), we get

which are just the conditions (66), and then  = 0 gives the constant dilaton solution
(69), (70). it is straightforward to check that the opposite is true as well: if 0 is a
constant dilaton solution, r0 = 0

 is a degenerate horizon for m = m0 = j(0).

let us now perform a perturbation around the degenerate radius of coincident hori-
zons, as it happens in the limit m  m0 and u(r)  0 between the two horizons.
we write
(74)
where   1 and k is a constant with the same sign as r0. the degenerate case
corresponds to   0. we introduce a new coordinate pair (t, r) dened by

m = m0 

2 ,

k

r = r0 + r .
expanding the function u(r) in powers of r  r0 we get

t =

this in the near-horizon limit   0 becomes (69).
we end by noting that for r0 < 0, i.e. the solution has constant negative curvature, k
is negative and redening it as k  m this is nothing but the ads2 black hole.

6 semiclassical theory and conclusions

we shall now make some semiclassical considerations concerning the sinh  model.
the hawking radiation is determined by the usual expression

< t f

 >=

n

12(cid:2)2

  ()2  t(cid:3)

(78)

and we now show why the choice t = 0 in kruskal coordinates is the most natural
one. the privileged point (r = 0) in which the killing vector must be normalized
corresponds in kruskal coordinates with the curve

x+x =

1
c

.

if we calculate < t > we get

< t f

this expression exactly vanishes when evaluated over the points of the curve (79).
the interpretation is then that because the two black holes placed at innity have the
same temperature there is a compensation between the hawking radiation coming from
each black hole giving no net hawking ux. the same considerations apply if we in-
terchange  with + in the previous formulas and we have t+ = 0 as well. we can also
wonder if it makes sense to choose evaporating boundary conditions t 6= t+. at
the classical level and by virtue of birkhoff theorem the solutions are parametrized by
a single constant c forcing the two black holes to have the same mass and tempera-
ture. however at the semiclassical level the birkhoff theorem no longer applies and we
could try for instance to increase the mass of one of the black holes and to see whether
or not a new equilibrium state is reached. moreover, if in view of a higher-dimensional
interpretation we restrict to the case  > 0 then the physical spacetime contains only
one black hole and it would seem natural to impose boundary conditions different from
the ones used above. these questions and the related semiclassical dynamical evolu-
tions will be studied elsewhere.
it is interesting to comment that in the jackiw-teitelboim limit the curvature singular-
ities disappear and we get contant curvature ads2 black holes (if  > 0). ads2 black
holes have been claimed not to emit hawking radiation [18] (if a nontrivial dilaton is
present, however, this might not be true, see [19]), which is exactly what happens in
our sinh  model although there the no radiation can be understood by the presence
of the mirror black hole. therefore intuitively the ads2 black hole inherits the no ra-
diation property of the more general model they arise in a certain limit. this is not the
case of the exponential model in which black holes evaporate [7]. in this model and
with the boundary conditions t = 0 the solutions represent black holes in equilib-
rium with a thermal bath. so the role of the mirror black hole is interchanged with the
existence of external radiation incoming onto the black hole.

appendix a
ads2s2 geometry in einstein-maxwell theory
in this appendix we shall describe a way to generate the robinson-bertotti (ads2
s2) geometry in einstein-maxwell gravity based on the possibility of construct-
ing constant-dilaton solutions explained in section 5. let us start with the einstein-
maxwell action

i =

where x = (t, r), d2 is the metric on the two-sphere and 1 is the planck lenght
(2 = g(4)), the dimensionally reduced action functional is [20]

the two-dimensional action takes the form [21]
