abstract

the standard klein bottle coecient in the construction of open descendants is shown
to equal the frobenius-schur indicator of a conformal eld theory. other consistent klein
bottle projections are shown to correspond to simple currents. these observations enable
us to generalize the standard open string construction from c-diagonal parent theories
to include non-standard klein bottles. using (generalizations of) the frobenius-schur
indicator we prove positivity and integrality of the resulting open and closed string state
multiplicities for standard as well as non-standard klein bottles.

introduction

the construction of closed and open string vacua are not on equal footing. with the use of
conformal eld theory (cft), closed (oriented) string theories can be constructed by mass
production: simply put, the problem is reduced to nding all possible modular invariants.
in sharp contrast, the construction of open (unoriented) string vacua is still at a primitive
level. the algoritm to construct open string theories with the use of cft is known as the
method of open descendants [1]. in short, one starts with a modular invariant closed oriented
(parent) theory, described by a torus partition function. then one truncates the spectrum
to an unoriented one by a klein bottle projection. generically, the resulting closed unoriented
theory is inconsistent due to massless tadpoles of unphysical particles. these tadpoles are then
removed by adding the right amount of open string sectors, described by annulus and mobius
strip.

so the problem of constructing open string vacua can be formulated as follows: given a
modular invariant parent theory, what are the allowed klein bottle, annulus and mobius strip?
the hope is that we can do this in a model independent way, that is, for any underlying
cft. there exists such a model independent prescription (usually referred to as the cardy
case) only in case of a c-diagonal1 parent theory with standard klein bottle projection and
symmetry preserving boundary conditions for the open strings. this prescription is used for
example in [2] [3]. in particular examples, the open descendants of non-c-diagonal invariants [2]
[3] [4] and/or non-standard klein bottles [5] [6] are found by use of rather lengthy and explicit
computations.

in this letter, we provide an elegant way to produce open descendants of c-diagonal parents
with non-standard klein bottle projections. this construction follows from the observation
that klein bottle projections correspond to simple currents. examples of this construction
have been discussed in [5] [7] in a dierent language. but it is the language of simple currents
that enables us to write down the model independent solution.

in section 2, we review the method of open descendants [1] [5] [7] with the use of partition
functions. this review is not meant as a pedagogical introduction to the subject; we merely
x our notation and present the formulas that are relevant for the discussion in this letter. in
the end of section 2, we discuss the c-diagonal case with a standard klein bottle. we also
provide a proof that this klein bottle projection is consistent, by showing that the klein bottle
coecient is equal to the frobenius-schur indicator of a conformal eld theory.

in section 3, we sum up some facts about simple currents [8]. it will turn out that the ideas
of this letter are most easily discussed when dealing with order 2 simple currents that have
(half-)integer spin. in subsection 3.1, we restrict ourselves to these simple currents, and show
that we can associate consistent klein bottle projection with them. from this observation, it
is straightforward to generalize the c-diagonal case to include non-standard klein bottles. in
subsection 3.2, we generalize this construction for order n simple currents.

finally, in appendix a, we derive some useful formulas involving simple currents and the

matrix p and the tensor y , which are encountered frequently in open string constructions.

1by c-diagonal we mean that the torus partition function is the charge conjugation invariant, where c

stands for cardy or charge conjugation.

2 a brief review of open descendants

the starting point in the construction of open string vacua is a consistent closed oriented string
theory, whose spectrum is encoded in a modular invariant torus partition function

izij j

,

t = xij

(1)

where z is a (symmetric) modular invariant. the index i labels the (chiral) primaries and i
are the characters. we assume the cft to be rational, so the range of this index is nite.

the second step is the construction of a closed unoriented theory out of the closed oriented
theory given by equation (1). this is done by halving the torus and adding to it a (halved)
klein bottle

the klein bottle coecient has to satisfy [5]2

k =

k ii

.

1

2 xi

k i = izii

,

(2)

(3)

(4)

where i = 1 and we dene i = 0 when zii = 0. this condition ensures that the sum (t +k)/2
contains sensible state multiplicities. which klein bottle coecients k i are allowed? we have
to require that in the new, unoriented theory, there is a zero probability of producing unphysical
states, that is, states that are no longer present after the projection. for example, consider the
case where we choose to symmetrize sectors i and j. the symmetry of a sector is conserved in
fusion: two states of opposite symmetry couple to an antisymmetric state, two states of equal
symmetry couple to a symmetric state. so, when k has a nonzero fusion with i and j, we also
have to symmetrize k. this can be summarized as follows: a klein bottle projection k i = izii
is consistent if and only if [5]

n k
ij ijk  0 ,

for all i, j and k; where n k
section 3, we describe a natural and simple way to nd dierent projections.

ij are the fusion coecients given by the verlinde formula [9]. in

the next step in the construction is the following: one observes that the klein bottle can
have two physically dierent interpretations, called channels.
in the direct channel, closed
strings propagate in a loop while undergoing an orientation twist. this is essentially the
partition function that we have discussed above. the second channel is known as the transverse
channel and is interpreted as the propagation of closed strings between two crosscap states. the
transverse klein bottle is

k = xi

2

i i

.

(5)

it is well known that both channels are related by a channel transformation, which in the
case of the klein bottle is the modular transformation s. therefore, the coecient i and the
klein bottle coecient k i are related:

k i = xm

s i

mmm .

(6)

for all i.

2we assume that the entries of the modular invariant z are 0 or 1. this should always be the case if xed

points are correctly resolved.

3

we will now discuss the open sector. the most important diagram is the annulus: it relates
the unknown open sector to the known closed sector by a channel transformation.
in the
transverse channel, closed strings propagate between two boundaries3 of opposite orientation.
the amplitude is given by

biabibi

.

(7)

aab = xi

the index a labels the inequivalent boundaries.

the direct channel has the interpretation of an open string propagating in a loop and is

therefore the open string partition function. it is given by

aab =

1

2 xi

ai

abi

.

(8)

the annulus coecients ai
ab are nonnegative integers. they count the number of open string
states in sector i with boundary conditions a and b that exist in the theory. since both
channels are related by a channel transformation, which is s in the case of the annulus, the
annulus coecients can be expressed in terms of the boundary coecients bia as follows:

ai

ab = xm

s i

mbmabmb ,

(9)

for all i, a and b.

the last step in the construction of open descendants is a projection of the open sector
to unoriented open string states. this is done by adding the mobius strip partition function
to that of the annulus. as for the other two surfaces discussed so far, the mobius strip has
two channels that are related by a channel transformation. let us start with the transverse
channel, which is interpreted as closed string propagation between a crosscap and a boundary
a (or vice versa). therefore, this amplitude can be written as the geometric mean of transverse
klein bottle and annulus :

in the direct channel the mobius strip is given by

ma = xi

ibia i

.

ma =

2 xi

m i

a i

(10)

(11)

where the twists m i
transformation, which is p = t st 2st for the mobius strip. so

a are related to the boundary and crosscap coecients via the channel

m i

a = xm

bmamp i

m ,

for all i and a.

the mobius coecients have to satisfy an extra condition [5], namely

|m i

a|  ai

aa and m i

a = ai

aa mod 2 .

(12)

(13)

this ensures that the open sector has nonnegative, integer state degeneracies in the sum (a +
m)/2.

3throughout this letter, we assume that the boundaries and the crosscaps do not break any of the worldsheet
symmetry (trivial gluing). we also ignore chan-paton multiplicities and tadpole cancellation here, but they
can easily be taken into account. we briey comment on these subjects at the end of section 3.

4

furthermore, the annulus coecients have to satisfy two polynomial equations, known as
completeness conditions [10]. we dene the reection coecients as ria = biasi0. it can be
shown [10] [11] [13] that the completeness conditions are satised if the reection coecients
are such that

riar

ib = ab

riar

ja = ij.

(14)

xi

, xa

in unpublished work of stanev [11], similar completeness conditions are derived for klein bottle,
mobius strip and annulus coecients. these conditions are satised when (6), (9), (12) and
(14) hold.

ab and m i

to summarize: the art of constructing open descendants is to nd the correct annulus and
mobius coecients, ai
a, for a given modular invariant zij and consistent klein bottle
projection k i. this amounts to solving equations (4), (6), (9), (12), (13) and (14). all these
equations can in principle be solved by brute force, but this is not very satisfying. we believe
that, in order to unravel the secrets of open strings, we should try to nd model-independent
solutions.

such a solution is known when the modular invariant is the charge conjugation invariant c.
in this case, the primary index set i and boundary index set a are the same. cardy [14] has
found an expression for the annulus coecients. they are simply the fusion rule coecients:

ai

ab = n i

ab .

(15)

the other coecients in the c-diagonal case can be expressed in terms of an integer-valued

tensor [6]

the mobius and klein bottle coecients are in this case [5]

y k

ij = xm

smipmjp k
m

sm0

.

m i

a = y i
a0

, k i = y i

00 .

(16)

(17)

in the appendix, we show that y i

00 is the frobenius-schur indicator i of a rational conformal
eld theory [15]: i = 1 when i is a real representation, i = 1 for a pseudoreal representation
and i = 0 for a complex representation. but this immediately implies

|y i

00| = i,ic

,

(18)

in agreement with equation (3) with z = c. the superscript c denotes the charge conjugate
of a eld.

this observation also implies that condition (4) is satised, provided that non-vanishing
frobenius-schur indicators in conformal eld theory are preserved in fusion, as they are in
lie-algebra tensor products:

ij = k,

for n k
ij

6= 0 , i 6= 0, j 6= 0, k 6= 0 .

this clearly implies (4).

the boundary and crosscap coecients are in this case

bia =

siasi0

,

i =

pi0si0

.

(19)

(20)

equations (6), (9), (12) now reduce to equations (16) and the verlinde formula.

in the next section we extend the c-diagonal case such that it includes dierent klein bottle

projections.

5

3 non-standard klein bottles

we begin by repeating some well-known properties of simple currents that are needed for our
discussion. a detailed review can be found in [12].

a eld j satisfying

for all i, is called a simple current. when j is a simple current, then so is any power of j.
every cft contains one trivial simple current, the identity 0. we can associate a charge qj (i)
of a eld i with repect to the simple current j dened by

j  i = i

,

(21)

qj (i) = hj + hi  hj i mod 1 .

(22)

where hi denotes the conformal weight of i. the order of a simple current is the smallest integer
n for which j n = 0. the charge of a eld with respect to the simple current j d is dqj and
the charge with respect to the identity 0 mod 1. so it follows that qj = k/n mod 1, where k is
an integer. this charge is conserved (modulo integers) in the fusion of two elds i and j:

qj (i) + qj (j) = qj (k) mod 1 ,

when n k
ij

6= 0. taking exponentials on both sides we get
e2iqj (i)e2iqj (j) = e2iqj (k)

,

(23)

(24)

when n k
ij

6= 0.

3.1 order 2 simple current klein bottles

to make the presentation in this letter as transparent as possible, we will for the moment
restrict to (half-)integer spin, order 2 simple currents. in the next subsection, we discuss order
n simple currents. let l be an order 2 simple current. then e2iql(i) = 1 and we have
arrived at a natural klein bottle projection:

k i

[l] = e2iql(i)y i

00 = y i

ll .

(25)

(we used equation (45) and the fact that l is order 2 and therefore real, to derive the last step
in this expression.) from equation (24), (19) and (18), it follows that this klein bottle satises
the conditions (3) and (4).

we now proceed by deriving the other coecients. from equation (6), (25) and (16) we

immediately see that the crosscap coecient must be4

[l]i =

pilsi0

.

(26)

now we need to determine the boundary coecients bai. suppose for the moment that they
do not change. then, from (12), (16) and (26), the mobius coecient becomes

m i

[l]a = y i

al .

(27)

4one could allow signs in this relation. an overall sign only aects the sign of the mobius amplitude, and is
taken into account later. typically signs that depend on i destroy the relation between the mobius amplitude
and the tensor y , and hence invalidate integrality and positivity of the partition function. however, we cannot
rule out that such signs might be acceptable in some special cases.

6

from equation (51) in the appendix, we see that this mobius strip coecient satises

|m i

[l]a|  n li

aa

and m i

[l]a = n li

aa mod 2 .

by equation (13), a natural candidate for the annulus coecients therefore is

ai

[l]ab = n li

ab .

(28)

(29)

this may appear to be in contradiction with (9) and the earlier assumption that the boundary
coecients do not change, but we will see in a moment that there is in fact no contradiction,
at least when l has (half-)integer spin and is of order 2.

to conclude: for every (half-)integer spin, order 2 simple current l, there is a class of open

descendants of a c-diagonal closed oriented theory, whose amplitudes are given by

k[l] =

a[l]ab =

m[l]a =

(30)

we note that these expressions agree with the amplitudes of some special cases displayed in [6]
and [7].

note that the transverse mobius strip is still the geometric mean of the transverse klein
bottle and annulus, despite of the appearance of the phase e2iql(i) in equation (31). the reason
is that one may describe all quantities as in formulas (5)(12), but with modied boundary
and crosscap coecients

b[l]ia =

,

[l]i =

.

(33)

siasil

pilsil

this appears to introduce an extra phase in the crosscap coecient in comparison with (26),
but it may be shown that pil vanishes precisely when ql(i)  z + 1/2 and l (half-)integer
spin. on the other hand, the extra phase in the boundary coecient yields precisely the
modied annulus, but does not aect the mobius strip, again because pil = 0 when this phase
is nontrivial. this is the way out of the apparent contradiction alluded to above. note however
that the assumption we made that the boundary coecients do not change, is wrong. they
do change, but this change is insignicant for order 2 (half-)integer spin simple currents, as
we have seen. in the next subsection, when we consider order n simple currents, we will rst
assume that equation (33) gives the correct boundary coecient and then give evidence for this
ansatz.

3.2 order n simple current klein bottles

the form of equation (33) suggests a natural generalization to higer order simple currents.
consider an order n simple current j, i.e. j n = 0. the charges of the elds with respect to j
are multiples of 1/n. nevertheless, consider the klein bottle

k i

[j] = e2iqj (i)y i

00 = y i j

j

.

(34)

7

we will now argue that this klein bottle is consistent. an obvious problem is of course what to
do with the elds that have non-(half-)integer charges, since these charges lead to unexceptable
phases. however, since the charge of a eld is minus the charge of its conjugate (modulo 1), all
elds with non-(half-)integer charges are complex, so the corresponding phases are killed by the
frobenius-shur indicator, i = y i
00. furthermore, equation (34) obviously satises equation (3)
and (4), so equation (34) is a consistent klein bottle.

what are the other coecients? after some algebra (equation (43) might be helpful), we

nd precisely the same crosscap coecient as in equation (33)5:

[j]i =

pijsij

.

(35)

from the last subsection, we have seen that the boundary coecients also change (see equa-
tion (33)). let us take as an ansatz for the boundary coecients

b[j]ia =

siasij

.

(36)

we will now give evidence for the correctness of this ansatz. by equations (12) and (9), the
mobius and annulus coecients become

m i

[j]a = y

j ca,j

i

, ai

[j]ab = n j i

ab .

(37)

from equations (51) and (42), it follows that these coecients satisfy the positivity and in-
tegrality conditions (13).
it may also be shown that for j order 2 and (half-)integer spin,
these coecients reduce to those of the last subsection, as expected. it is straightforward to
show that this set of coecients respect (14) and hence also the completeness conditions of [10]
and [11]. this is strong evidence that our ansatz for the boundary coecient, equation (36), is
indeed correct.

to conclude: for every simple current j, there is a class of open descendants of a c-diagonal

closed oriented theory, whose amplitudes are given by

k[j] =

we have argued that these amplitudes satisfy consistency of the klein bottle projection, posi-
tivity and integrality of the open string sector and the completeness conditions.

it is in particular instructive to consider the identity sector i = 0, from which the gauge
bosons emerge. if we allow for non-trivial chan-paton multiplicities na the number of massless
vector bosons is

(41)

5one may use any unambiguous denition of the square root in the complex plane. note that in all relevant

quantities one only encounters the square or the absolute value squared of sij .

8

in the standard case, j = 0, this reduces to 1
2 pa(nanac naa), where a is the frobenius-schur
indicator, and ac denotes the charge conjugate of a. the overall sign of the mobius strip is
xed by tadpole cancellation to sign(p00). given this sign, the type of gauge group one gets
is completely determined by the frobenius-schur indicator: a = 0 implies a 6= ac and leads to
u(na) gauge groups (this requires na = nac), whereas a = 1(1) leads to so(n) (sp(n)) if p00
is positive (and vice-versa if p00 is negative). analogous conclusions hold for non-trivial klein
bottles, but in terms of a generalized frobenius-schur indicator y

equations (35) and (36) summarize our results.

in this form the simple current origin
of modied klein bottles is most transparent.
in fact the only change one has to make in
comparision with (20) is to replace all occurences of the identity eld 0 by a simple current j,
with no restriction on its spin or order.

it is in general not true that all simple currents lead to dierent string theories, but we have

checked explicitly that many of them do.

an obvious question one might ask is: can all nontrivial klein bottles be obtained by simple

currents? this question is unfortunately still open.

a some algebra with j s, p s and y s

in this appendix, we present some useful formulas that are needed in the main text. j denotes
an order n simple current. we start by recalling [8] that

sj i,j = e2iqj (j)sij

, tj i = e2i[hj qj (i)] ti

.

from this we can derive that

pj i,j = ei[ qj (j) qj (i)]pi,j j

.

(42)

(43)

the purpose of the hats on q is to avoid sign ambiguities related to the denition of the square
root of t in the denition of p . indeed, if we use denition (22) for the charge, then (43) is

only dened up to a sign. this ambiguity is easily resolved by dening t  exp[i(h c/24)],

and by dening q as in (22) but without the mod 1 freedom.
with the use of equations (42) and (43) we can calculate
i,j j = ei[ qj (k) qj (j)2 qj (i)]y k
y j k

ij

taking j = k = 0 in equation (44) gives

y i j

j = e2iqj (i)y i

taking i = a, j = 0, k = j ci, equation (44) gives

aj | = |y j ci

we now prove that yi00 is the frobenius-schur indicator. let us rst rewrite the tensor yijk in

(51)

this implies posivity and integrality of the open string partition function. interestingly, in [15]
these properties of (49) were derived from the requirement of positivity and integrality of the
dimension of eigenspaces of certain braid matrices. these dimensions turn out to be equal to
the multiplicities of open string ground states!

finally we remark that these properties of the y -tensor may also be derived from the fusion

coecients of permutation orbifolds, derived in [16].

ours, and for that reason do not satisfy in general the positivity and integrality requirements.
