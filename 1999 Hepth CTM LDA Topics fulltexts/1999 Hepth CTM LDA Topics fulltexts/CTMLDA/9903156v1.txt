it is shown that the worldvolume eld theory of a single d3-brane in a supergravity d3-brane
background admits nite energy, and non-singular, abelian monopoles and dyons preserving 1/2
or 1/4 of the n = 4 supersymmetry and saturating a bogomolnyi-type bound. the 1/4 super-
symmetric solitons provide a worldvolume realisation of string-junction dyons. we also discuss the
dual m-theory realisation of the 1/2 supersymmetric dyons as nite tension self-dual strings on the
m5-brane, and of the 1/4 supersymmetric dyons as their intersections.

i. introduction

the n = 4 supersymmetric yang-mills (sym) the-
ory with gauge group su (k) spontaneously broken to
u (1)k1 has a spectrum of 1/2 supersymmetric magnetic
monopoles and dyons which, together with the elemen-
tary particles of the perturbative spectrum, ll out orbits
of an sl(2; z) electromagnetic duality group. each such
particle has an interpretation in iib superstring theory
as an (m, n) string stretched between a pair of parallel
d3-branes, chosen from among k parallel d3-branes. for
k = 2 there are no other particles in the spectrum but for
k  3 there are additional, 1/4 supersymmetric, dyons
that are entirely non-perturbative in the sense that they
belong to sl(2; z) orbits that contain no elementary
particles. although these can be found as classical so-
lutions of the sym eld equations [13] they were rst
found as iib superstring congurations in which three
strings of dierent (m, n) charges, attached to three d3-
branes, meet at a string junction [4]. these are points
at which two iib strings of charges (m, n) and (m, n)
meet to form a string of charge (m + m, n + n) [5]. the
minimum energy state to which the conguration relaxes
is one in which three strings leaving the three d3-branes
meet at a planar string junction [6,7].

actually, the eective action of the d3-branes is not
a sym theory but rather a supersymmetric non-abelian
dirac-born-infeld (dbi) theory. the precise nature of
this theory is not known (see [8] for a recent discussion)
but it has an expansion in powers of f that simplies in
certain limits;  is the inverse iib string tension and f is
the (background covariant) born-infeld eld strength. if
l is the minimal separation between the d3-branes then
(as we shall later see explicitly) f  l2/, so the
expansion parameter is actually l2/. for l << 
we need keep only the quadratic terms in f and the ac-

tion reduces to the n = 4 sym theory (for a vacuum
iib background). for l >>  we cannot truncate the
expansion but we may neglect the non-abelian interac-
tions; the action then reduces to a sum of abelian dbi
actions governing the dynamics of independent parallel
d3-branes. the d3-brane action depends on the super-
gravity background. for example, f = f  b where f is
the usual 2-form u (1) eld strength, satisfying df = 0,
and b is the pullback of the background ns-ns 2-form
potential. the d3-brane couples to the background r-r
gauge elds through a wess-zumino lagrangian lw z.
let i be the worldvolume coordinates, (i = 0, 1, 2, 3).
omitting fermions and setting  = 1, the lagrangian is
then

l = eq det(gij + fij) + lw z

(1)

where gij is the induced worldvolume metric and  the
background dilaton eld. for the backgrounds we con-
sider,  is a constant, b vanishes, and lw z is just the
minimal coupling of the d3-brane to the 4-form gauge
potential of iib supergravity.

for widely separated branes it makes sense to ask what
a dyon looks like locally on one of the d3-branes, i.e. as a
solution of the abelian n = 4 supersymmetric dbi theory
with the above lagrangian. because abelian monopoles
and dyons have innite energy, this question would not
make sense in the context of a u (1) sym theory, but the
innite energy has a natural interpretation in the dbi
context as the energy associated with an innite string
of xed tension.
in fact, the abelian dbi theory does
have innite energy 1/2 supersymmetric solutions that
appear as spikes on the worldvolume with uniform en-
ergy per unit length [9,10]. the spike solutions of the
abelian dbi theory were called bions in [7], following a
slightly dierent use of this term in [10]. in the case of

1

the d3-brane there are dyonic (m, n)-bions correspond-
ing to innite (m, n) strings that end on the d3-brane.
although the innite energy of a bion has a clear physical
interpretation, it is nevertheless a cause for concern be-
cause, for example, solutions with innite energy make
no contribution to the semi-classical evaluation of the
path-integral. one should really think of these solutions
as limiting cases of the more physical situation in which
the string eventually ends on another d3-brane, but it
might then appear that we are forced to return to the
non-abelian dbi theory. one purpose of this paper is
to show that this problem can be circumvented by re-
placing the second d3-brane by a supergravity d3-brane
background. we remark that the innite energy problem
is also cirumvented by certain non-supersymmetric solu-
tions of the dbi action [10], but these do not correspond
to bps states of n = 4 sym theory.
the super d3-brane action can be consistently formu-
lated in any background that solves the equations of iib
supergravity. one such solution is the supergravity d3-
brane. for this solution the dilaton is constant and we
shall set it to zero; this corresponds to unit string cou-
pling constant. the remaining non-vanishing elds are
the metric and the 4-form potential c with self-dual 5-
form eld strength r = dc. these are given by

ds2 = h 1/2ds2(e(1,3)) + h 1/2ds2(e6)
r = vol(e(1,3))  dh 1 + 6dh

(2)

where 6 is the hodge dual on e6 and h is harmonic on
this space. point singularities of h are coordinate singu-
larities of the spacetime metric at connected components
of a degenerate event horizon. the proper distance to
the horizon on spacelike hypersurfaces of constant e(1,3)
coordinates is innite, so that there are internal asymp-
totic innities. if we wish the d3-brane horizon to have
a single connected component then we must choose a
single-centre metric with

h = 1 +

q

| ~x  ~x0|4

,

(3)

where ~x are cartesian coordinates on e6 and ~x0 is a
constant e6 6-vector. let us now put a test d3-brane in
this background, at ~x = 0. the dbi equations can now
have solutions representing innite (m, n) strings that go
into one of the internal asymptotic regions of the back-
ground geometry. we shall show that there exist static
bion solutions of this type, and that they have a nite
energy, saturating a bogomolnyi-type bound. in fact, if
| ~x0| = l then the energy of the static bion is precisely
l times the tension of an (m, n) string. eectively, we
have replaced the second d3-brane of the su (2) theory
by a d3-brane background, thereby nding nite energy,
and non-singular, supersymmetric monopoles and dyons
in the abelian dbi theory. actually, it would be more ac-
curate to consider this brane in brane background con-
guration as representing the large k limit of an su (k)

theory broken to su (k  1)  u (1) with the su (k  1)
theory replaced by the supergravity background.
the same logic that leads us to expect 1/2 supersym-
metric bions on the d3-brane also leads us to expect
that it should be possible to nd the 1/4 supersymmet-
ric string junctions this way. consider rst the case in
which one of the three strings in a string junction cong-
uration has shrunk to zero length. in this case we are left
with a conguration of two overlapping strings of dier-
ent (m, n) charges each stretched between a dierent pair
of d3-branes. in the special case of an orthogonal over-
lap of an f-string, charge (1,0), with a d-string, charge
(0,1), this conguration can be represented by the array

d3 : 1 2 3      
d1 :    4     
f 1 :     5    

the corresponding 1/4 supersymmetric dyon solution on
the d3-brane was recently found [11]; it depends on two
independent worldspace functions that are harmonic in
the euclidean metric. here we shall nd the general two-
harmonic-function solution and explain its interpreta-
tion as a string junction.
in a at background these
solutions again have innite energy. the strategy ex-
plained above to nd nite energy solutions can be used
here too, but in this case we must use a background har-
monic function h with two isolated singularities, i.e. we
replace (3) by

h = 1 +

q1

| ~x  ~x1|4

+

q2

| ~x  ~x2|4

(4)

where ~x1 and ~x2 are two 6-vectors giving the positions
of the background supergravity d3-branes. a string leav-
ing the test d3-brane can now split, at a string junction,
into two strings, each of which continues indenitely into
one of the two internal asymptotic regions of the back-
ground geometry. as we shall see, such congurations
correspond to nite energy abelian dbi solitons saturat-
ing precisely the bogomolnyi-type bound expected of a
1/4 supersymmetric dyon.

the 1/2 supersymmetric dyons on a d3-brane of iib
superstring theory have an m-theory counterpart as self-
dual string solitons on an m5-brane [12,7]. in at d=11
spacetime these strings have innite tension, as expected
from their spacetime interpretation as semi-innite m2-
branes with a boundary on an m5-brane. however the
m5-brane action can be consistently formulated in any
background that solves the equations of d=11 supergrav-
ity. one such solution is the supergravity m5-brane. the
11-metric and 4-form eld strength of this solution are

11 = u 1/3ds2(e(5,1)) + u 2/3d ~x  d ~x
ds2
f(4) = 5du

(5)

where ~x are cartesian coordinates on e5 and u is a har-
monic function on this space. singularities of u are just

2

horizons of the 11-metric which are at an innite proper
distance on the spacelike hypersurfaces of constant e(5,1)
coordinates.
in other words, there are again internal
asymptotic regions into which we can take an m2-brane
emanating from a test m5-brane in this background. in
this way we nd self-dual string solitons on the m5-brane
worldvolume with nite tension. the 1/4 supersymmet-
ric dyons on the iib d3-brane also have an m-theory
analogue, this time as intersecting self-dual string soli-
tons on the m5-brane. for an m5-brane in at space-
time, these were found in [13] from the requirement of
1/4 supersymmetry; here we show that they saturate a
bogomolnyi-type bound, although the total energy is, of
course, innite. by considering the m5-brane in a two-
centre m5-brane background we are able to nd solutions
that represent intersecting nite-tension self-dual strings.
we begin with some details of the d3-brane hamil-
tonian in a supergravity d3-brane background that we
need for our subsequent discussion of nite energy bions
and string junctions. we then discuss the dual m-theory
realisation of these solitons.

ii. d3-brane hamiltonian in a d3-brane

background

the hamiltonian form of the super d3-brane la-
grangian density in a general superspace background was
given in [14]. setting fermions to zero and specializing to
a background of the form assumed above we have

l = pm x m + ea va + vtg  sapa 

1
2

vh

(6)

where x m are the spacetime coordinates and pm the 10-
momentum (m = 0, 1, . . . , 9), and va is the bi 3-vector
potential (a = 1, 2, 3) and ea its conjugate electric eld
3-vector. the constraint functions associated with the
constraints imposed by the lagrange multiplers vt, sa
and v are

h = gmn (p  c)m (p  c)n + eaebgab + det (g + f )
g = aea
pa = (p  c)m ax m + ebfba
where g is the background metric, g is the induced
worldspace metric, f the magnetic eld 2-form and cm is
x m in the wz term, i.e lw z = x mcm.
the coecient of

(7)

in the static gauge

(12)

(13)

(14)

c = h 1 .

(10)

in static

(11)

in addition, the constraint pa = 0 implies,
gauge, that
pm =(cid:16)e,( ~p  ~c)  a ~x  ebfab, ~p(cid:17)

where e is the energy density. since ~p  ~c vanishes for
static congurations we have

(p  c)m =(cid:16)e  h 1,ebfab, ~0(cid:17) .

if this is now used in the constraint h = 0 we can solve
for e to get

(e + h 1)2 = ecedfacfbdab

1

+ h 

2 (cid:2)eaebgab + det(g + f )(cid:3)

where

gab = h 

1

2 ab + h

1

2 a ~x  b ~x .

when h = 1 this reduces to the result given in [7] except
for a shift of the vacuum energy. to obtain precisely the
result of [7] when h = 1 one would have to take c =
h 11; the dierence is just a gauge transformation and
hence without physical signicance. the choice c = h 1
is convenient because it ensures that the wz term cancels
the vacuum energy of the dbi term.

iii. finite energy bions

we shall begin by choosing the harmonic function h
to have the form (3) with ~x0 = (l, 0, . . . , 0). on the
x-axis we then have

h = 1 +

q

(x  l)4 .

(15)

we shall be interested in bions that can be interpreted
as strings stretched between the test d3-brane and the
source d3-brane. it is obvious that the minimum energy
conguration must then be one for which the only non-
zero worldvolume eld is x() so we now set the others
to zero. in this case

gab = h 

1

2 ab + h

1

2 axbx

(16)

and

x m = (i, ~x) ,

(8)

det(g + f ) = h 

3

where i = (t, a) are the worldvolume coordinates, we
have

cm = (c, 0, ~c) ,

where, for a background of the form assumed here,

(9)

3

2 (cid:2)1 + h|x|2 + h|b|2(cid:3)
2 (x  b)2

1

+ h

where b is the magnetic eld 3-vector dened by

fab = abcbc .

this leads to the formula

(17)

(18)

(e + h 1)2 = h 2 + h 1(cid:2)|x|2 + |e|2 + |b|2(cid:3)

+(x  e)2 + (x  b)2 + |e  b|2 (19)

which we can rewrite, for arbitrary angle , as

where now

h = 1 +

qr4

l4(r  r0)4 .

(28)

(e + h 1)2 =(cid:2)h 1 + cos (e  x) + sin (b  x)(cid:3)2
+ h 1|e  cos x|2 + h 1|b  sin x|2
+ | sin (e  x)  cos (b  x)|2
+ |e  b|2 .

(20)

from this expression we deduce the bound

(e + h 1)2 (cid:2)h 1 + cos (e  x) + sin (b  x(cid:3)2

(21)

.

and hence that

as r approaches r0 from above we have

ds2

3  q

1

u (cid:19)2
2 (cid:18) du

+ q

1

2 l2u2d2
2

(29)

where u = r  r0. the proper distance to r = r0 is
therefore innite. in fact, the sphere at r = r0 is mapped
to a single point ~x = ~x0 in the transverse space. the
worldspace of a single bion along the x-axis therefore
has two boundaries: one at r = , where x = 0, and
another at r = r0. where x = l. the surface integrals
of (24) vanish at the r =  boundary, and since x = l
on the other boundary we have

e  cos (e  x) + sin (b  x)

(22)

for any . integrating over the worldspace and then max-
imising the right hand side with respect to  we arrive
at the bound

where

qe = l qe ,

qm = l qm ,

(30)

qe =i ds  e = cos  q ,
qm =i ds  b = sin  q

(31)

m z d3 e pq2

e + q2
m

where tan  = qm/qe, and

qe =z d3 e  x =i ds  ex ,
qm =z d3 b  x =i ds  bx .

(23)

(24)

here we have used the fact that b is divergence-free by
denition and that e is divergence-free as a result of the
gauss law constraint. the nal surface integrals must
be taken over all components of the boundary surface of
worldspace.

the bound (23) is saturated by solutions of

e = cos x ,

b = sin x .

(25)

these are just the at space abelian bogomolnyi equa-
tions. since both e and b are divergence-free we de-
duce, as in the at-space case, that x is harmonic on
worldspace (in the euclidean metric). for a single bion
of charge q with x vanishing at spatial innity on the
brane we have

x = q/4r

(r > r0  q/4l)

(26)

where r = || is the distance from the origin in e3.
worldspace metric is

the lower bound on r comes about because the

2 ,

(27)

are the electric and magnetic charges coupling to the bi
eld on the brane. the bion mass is therefore

m = |q|l/()2

(32)

where we have now reinstated . this is the mass
of a string of tension |q|/()2 and length l. taking
into acount the quantization condition on the iib string
charges, and the fact that we have set the string cou-
pling constant to unity, the tension of an (m, n) string is
m2 + n2/, so

q = pm2 + n2 .

(33)

reinstating  in (25) we see that the maximum value
of e or b is l2/q  l2/, so the expansion pa-
rameter of the dbi action is l2/, as claimed earlier.
actually, if m or n is very large then the eective expan-
sion parameter is really smaller than l2/ by a factor
of 1/m2 + n2. for given l, the neglect of the dbi cor-
rections to the sym theory can therefore be justied by
considering a suciently large charge, so the sym theory
is adequate for a description of macroscopic objects. the
dbi corrections are important only for the description of
microscopic objects.

in terms of the electrostatic analogy, the above con-
struction can be viewed as a regularization of the innite
self-energy of a point particle in which a point charge
is replaced by a perfectly conducting charged spherical
shell. this is clearly unsatisfactory as a solution to the
electrostatic self-energy problem of electrodynamics be-
cause any surface of spherical topology carrying the same

4

total charge would serve the same purpose. here too we
could replace the spherical shell by a shell of any other
shape, but in our case this has no eect on the physics.
to see this we rst note that the surface of the shell is,
by hypothesis, an equipotential with potential x = l.
it follows that every point on it is mapped to the point
~x = ~x0 in transverse space. this point is at innite
proper distance in the transverse space metric and hence
in the induced worldspace metric. the equipotential sur-
face x = l in e3 is therefore a point at innity in the
induced worldspace metric. neighbouring equipotential
surfaces of constant x < l can be used to dene co-
ordinates in the neighbourhood of x = l for which x
is again given by (26). it then follows that the induced
worldvolume metric in this neigbourhood is (29). but the
minimum energy metric is determined by its behaviour
near points at innity. the initial shape of the shell is
therefore irrelevant to the nal solution.

the spherical symmetry of the one bion solution is
therefore in no way essential to the construction of -
nite energy bions, and multi-bion solutions can be con-
structed analogously: we remove n closed surfaces of
spherical topology from e3 and choose their potential x
to correspond to the centre of the background d3-brane
spacetime metric. the potential is set to zero at innity.
there is now a unique solution of laplaces equation for
x; this is the sought multi-bion solution. using this so-
lution we may compute the worldspace metric to which
it corresponds. this metric will have n points at innity
near each of which it will take the form (29). dierent
shapes of the initial surfaces just correspond to dier-
ent choices of coordinates for the (unphysical) euclidean
3-space.

iv. dbi string junctions

in this section we will rst derive the general bound
saturated by 1/4 supersymmetric dyons in a general two-
centre d3-brane background; then we will move on to
discuss their interpretation as string junctions in the sim-
pler case of a at background, to return nally to their
interpretation in the general case.

a. the bps bound

so far we have considered a test d3-brane in a single-
centre parallel d3-brane background. we now want to
consider a two-centre background, e.g

h = 1 +

1

| ~x  ~x1|

+

1

| ~x  ~x2|

(34)

where ~x1 and ~x2 are two non-zero vectors. we
may choose them to lie in the plane for which ~x =
(x, y, 0, . . . , 0). a static d3-brane conguration in such

5

a background will generally have non-constant x() and
y (). the same reasoning as before now leads to the
following expression for the energy density:

(cid:0)e + h 1(cid:1)2

= h 2 + h 1(cid:2)|x|2 + |y |2 + |e|2 + |b|2(cid:3)
+ (x  e)2 + (y  e)2
+ (x  b)2 + (y  b)2
+ |e  b|2 + |x  y |2 .

(35)

we can rewrite the right hand side, for arbitrary angle 
as

[h 1 + cos  e  x  sin  e  y

+ sin  b  x + cos  b  y ]2

+ h 1 [e  cos  x + sin  y ]2
+ h 1 [b  sin x  cos y ]2

+ [sin  e  x + cos  e  y

 cos  b  x + sin  b  y ]2

+ |e  b  x  y |2 .

we thereby deduce that

e  cos  e  x  sin  e  y

+ sin  b  x + cos  b  y ,

for any , with equality when

e = cos x  sin y ,
b = sin x + cos y .

(36)

(37)

(38)

by integrating (37) over the worldspace and maximising
the right hand side with respect to  we deduce that the
total mass m satises the bound

m q(qx

m  qy
e ) and (qx

e )2 + (qy

m + qx

e )2

(39)

where (qx
m) are the non-vanishing
components of the electric and magnetic charge 6-vectors

m, qy

e , qy

~qe =i ds  e ~x ,

~qm =i ds  b ~x .

the bound on m may now be rewritten in the form

m q| ~qe|2 + | ~qm|2 + 2 | ~qe|| ~qm| sin 

where  is the angle between the two 6-vectors ~qe and
~qm. this is precisely the bps bound saturated by 1/4
supersymmetric dyons in n = 4 d = 4 sym theories
it is invariant under so(6) rotations of the 6-
[15,4].
vectors ~qe and ~qm, and under an so(2) rotation of these
two 6-vectors into each other, as expected from the u (4)
automorphism group of the n = 4 d = 4 supersymmetry
algebra. when sin  = 0 we recover the formula for 1/2

(40)

(41)

where p is the 4-momentum and z a complex central
charge in the 6 representation of su (4). from the fact
that the left-hand side is positive semi-denite we deduce
the bound

m 4  2am 2 + a2  4b  0

where m 2 = p 2 and
z ij zij ,

supersymmetric congurations for which m 2 is propor-

that can be constructed from ~qe and ~qm [16].

these results actually follow directly from the super-
symmetry algebra, as we now show. the n = 4 super-
symmetry charges can be taken to be four two-component
complex spinors of sl(2; c) in the fundamental 4 repre-
sentation of u (4). let qi
 ( = 1, 2, i = 1, 2, 3, 4) be
these charges, with q  i their complex conjugates in the
4 representation of u (4). the matrix of anticommutators

where x0 and y0 are constants. in new coordinates ro-

where we take the positive square root because this yields
the strongest bound. comparison with (41) shows that

a = | ~qe|2 + | ~qm|2 ,
b = | ~qe|2| ~qm|2  ( ~qe  ~qm)2 .

(46)

when b = 0 this reduces to the formula m 2 = | ~qe|2 +
| ~qm|2 applicable to 1/2 supersymmetric dyons. other-
wise only 1/4 supersymmetry is preserved.

b. the at background case

we shall begin our discussion of the 1/4 supersymmet-
ric dyons, and of their interpretation as string junctions,
by considering rst the simpler case of a at supergrav-
ity background, i.e. we set h = 1. since both e and
b are divergence-free, it follows from (38) that both x
and y are harmonic functions, vanishing at worldspace
innity. as we will see, the most general string junction
can be realised by choosing x and y to have two centres.
hence, we choose two points 1 and 2 in e3 and solve
the laplace equations for x and y everywhere else in e3
by setting

q =q(qx

.

the electric and magnetic elds are

e  cos( + )x  ,

b  sin( + )x  .

(53)

this looks like a 1/2 supersymmetric bion with a spike
along the x -axis (see fig. 1), total charge q and  =

(60)

and we proceed according to the general prescription
given earlier. we remove two 3-balls from e3 to cre-
ate two boundaries, s1 and s2, that are shells with the
topology of 2-spheres. we take these to be equipotentials
with (x, y ) = (l1, l
2) on
s2. the potential at innity vanishes. there is a unique
solution to the laplace equations for x and y subject to
these boundary conditions. note that now the charges

are xed once the positions of the internal asymptotic
regions of the background are specied. this was to be
expected for the following reason. because two of the
strings are forced to go down each of these regions, the
background determines completely the relative orienta-
tion among the three strings in the junction. the condi-
tions of charge conservation and tension balance then x
the values of the charges.

the three strings arise again from the behaviour of the
solution near each of the shells and far away from both
of them. although the nal result is the same as in the
at case, the analysis is not so straightforward owing to
the fact that the explicit expressions for x and y are no
longer available. however, we will see that we have suf-
cient information to verify that the charge conservation
and tension balance conditions are still satised.

the main subtlety comes about when trying to assign
a direction to each of the strings. for deniteness, let
us look at the region near s1. we have x  l1 and
y  l
1, so this region is mapped into one of the in-
ternal asymptotic regions of the background. we would
like to determine the direction in the x  y plane along
which x and y approach their asymptotic values as we
approach the surface s1; this will be the direction along
which we will take the string to point. we can proceed in
the following way. we consider approaching s1 along a
normal to the surface, parametrised by some coordinate
r (see g. 2).

in other words, it corresponds to a (m, n) string with

m = q cos( + ) ,

n = q sin( + ) .

(54)

similarly, near 2 we have

(55)

therefore this again looks like a 1/2 supersymmetric
bion, now with its spike at an angle  to the x-axis,
with total charge q and  =  +  (see fig. 1), where

q =q(qx

2 )2 + (qy

2 )2 ,

tan  = qy

(56)

in other words, the two approximate bion spikes near
either singularity are rotated relative to each other by
the same angle    in both space and charge space.

finally, consider a region far from both singularities,

where r is the distance from either singularity. we again
have what looks like a 1/2 supersymmetric bion, with

and  =  +  (see g. 1), where now

q =q(qx

and

(58)

(59)

note that  is dened by this formula only modulo .
in this case we take the angle dening the orientation in
charge space to be  +  even though the angle dening
the direction in the x  y plane is  +  + . this is
because we consider the string orientations to be such
that this string enters the junction whereas the other
two leave it.

one important fact that supports the string junction
interpretation of the conguration we have described is
that, as is easily checked, it satises both charge conser-
vation (required for existence of a string junction [5]) and
tension balance (required for it to be static and super-
symmetric [6]).

c. the two-centre background

the energy of the conguration described in the previ-
ous section is innite, as expected for a at background.
to nd nite energy solutions we return to the d3-brane
background with h given by (34). we set

where q and  are given by (56). as in the at back-
ground case, we see that the two approximate 1/2 super-
symmetric bions are rotated by the same angle in space
and charge space. finally, far away from both shells the
solution behaves as in (57), so it again looks like a third
1/2 supersymmetric bion with spike at an angle  to the
x-axis, total charge q and  =  + , with q and  as in
(58) and (59).

in summary, the situation is again as depicted in fig.
1. charge conservation and tension balance are satised.
the dierence is, of course, that now the energy is nite.

this normal is mapped to a curve in the x  y plane
ending on ~x1 (see fig. 2). the tangent vector to this
curve is ~t = (x , y ), where the prime denotes dierenti-
ation with respect to r. we still cannot take ~t to dene
the direction of the string, because it depends on the
choice of normal to the surface along which we approach
it. the most natural way to dene the string direction
is therefore to take the average value ~t of ~t over s1. in
other words, we dene

t1 is1

(62)

where we made use of the fact that x and y are nor-
mal to s1 (in the electrostatic analogy, this corresponds
to the electric eld being normal to a perfectly conduct-
ing shell). we take the string to lie at an angle  to the
x-axis, where

innite tension self-dual string solitons of the m5-
brane worldvolume eld theory preserving 1/2 super-
symmetry were found in [12], and shown to saturate a
bogomolnyi-type bound in [7]. such solutions reduce to
bions on a iia d4-brane, and these are t-dual to the
electric d3-brane bions discussed above. here we shall
nd nite tension self-dual strings on the m5-brane by
considering an m5-brane in the m5-brane supergravity
background (5). we shall follow the approach of [7] for
which the starting point is the m5-brane hamiltonian,
which we now need in an m5-brane background. this can
be extracted from the hamiltonian form of the super m5-
brane in a general superspace background given in [17],
by proceeding along the lines of section ii. in order to do
this, one needs the expression for the supergravity 6-form
potential c(6) (dual to c(3)), which couples minimally to
the m5-brane through the wz term. for the m5-brane
solution (5) one choice is c(6) = u 1 vol(e(5,1)); other
allowed choices dier by a gauge transformation and are
therefore physically equivalent. for this choice, and in
the static gauge

where q is given in (52). the string is therefore an (m, n)
string with m and n as given in (54). we conclude that
the solution near s1 looks like a 1/2 supersymmetric dyon
of total charge q and  =  + .

completely analogous arguments lead to the conclu-
sion that the solution near s2 looks like another 1/2 su-
persymmetric dyon, this time with its spike at an angle
 to the x-axis, of total charge q and with  =  + ,

this is essentially the formula given in [7] except for the
shift u 1 in the energy due to the wz term and the u -
dependence of the right hand side, which is part explicit
and part implicit in the u -dependence of the induced
worldspace metric,

gab = u 1/3 ab + u 2/3 a ~x  b ~x .

our aim is now to nd nite tension worldvolume self-
dual string solitons representing an m2-brane stretched
between the parallel test m5-brane and the background
m5-brane. we therefore choose a single-centre harmonic
function u , with a singularity on the x-axis at a distance
l from the origin in e5. thus, on the x-axis we have

u = 1 +

q

(l  x)3 .

(69)

by arguments analogous to those of previous sections,
the energy will be minimised when all scalars but x zero.
setting these scalars to zero, the expression for the energy
then simplies to

innite so we should restrict the worldspace coordinate
u to be positive. note that not only does the 3-sphere
at constant u contract to a point at u = 0, but so also
does the circle of length l along the  direction. thus, it
is not only the 3-sphere of radius r0 that is mapped to
the single point ~x = (l, 0, . . . , 0) in the target space; all
points on the string core at r = r0 are also mapped to
this point!

we are now in a position to evaluate the integral of
(77) for the tension of the m5-brane string soliton. there
are two components of w. one is at r = , where
x = 0, and the other is at r = r0, where x = l. the
only contribution to the integral comes from the latter
boundary, so the string tension is

where 5 is the hodge dual on worldspace, in the eu-
clidean metric, and i denotes contraction with the (con-
stant) vector eld . this inequality is saturated when

where

h = i(5dx) ,

l x = 0

(75)

where l is the lie derivative with respect to . these
conditions, which are the same as those of the at back-
ground case, imply lh = 0. the minimum energy so-
lution is therefore invariant under translations in the 
direction, which we may take to be compact with length
l. the total energy is then

e  l  |z| ,

where z is the topological charge found by integrating
the 4-form dx  h over the 4-dimensional hypersurface
w with normal , i.e.

is the string charge (as the string threads the 3-sphere).
the total energy is therefore llq, as one would expect
for a membrane of area ll and charge q.

vi. intersecting strings on the

m5-brane

we now turn to the study of two intersecting self-dual
strings on the m5-brane, corresponding to the spacetime

conguration

m 5 : 1 2 3 4 5     
m 2 :    4  6    
m 2 :     5  7   

therefore we allow for two scalars to be excited, in which
case

+ |e  b + k|2 + (k  e)2 + (k  b)2
+(cid:2)k  x  y + (4x5y  4y 5x)2
+ b  x4y  b  y 4x
+ e  x5y  e  y 5x(cid:3)2

.

(89)

we start to see the beginning of what looks like an
expression for the energy of static congurations on the
3-brane obtained by compactifying the m5-brane on a
2-torus, as expected from the standard duality between
m-theory and the iib superstring theory. the compar-
ison is, however, complicated by several factors. one
is that the notion of static for an m5-brane congura-
tion does not coincide with what we meant by this term
in the d3-brane case. the point is that the 3-form h
on the m5-brane worldspace includes conguration space
variables and their conjugate momenta (via a constraint
relating h to the momentum conjugate to the 2-form
potential [14]). a related point is that the space trans-
verse to the m5-brane is only 5-dimensional whereas the
space transverse to the d3-brane is 6-dimensional. the
sixth scalar, and its conjugate momentum are encoded
in the 3-form h.
in fact, one can roughly view k as
the eld strength of the sixth scalar and  as its con-
jugate momentum, although k is only a closed 1-form
when e and b are independent of 4 and 5. clearly,
a direct comparison with the d3-brane energy would re-
quire that we include in the latter some 3-scalar terms
as well as some terms that vanish for static congura-
tions (in the d3-brane sense). instead, we shall set k
and  to zero and compare with the expression for the
energy of static 2-scalar d3-brane congurations. note
that, under these conditions, the closure of the 3-form h
implies that e and b are divergence-free, in which case
they may be identied as the electric and magnetic elds
on the d3-brane.

with this simplication, the expression (89) can be

written, for arbitrary angle , as

(cid:2)u 1 + cos  e  x  sin  e  y
+ sin  b  x + cos  b  y(cid:3)2
+|e  b  x  y |2 + (4x5y  4y 5x)2

we thereby deduce the bound

e  cos  e  x  sin e  y

+ sin  b  x + cos  b  y ,

(91)

for any , with equality when both

4x = 5x = 4y = 5y = 0 ,

(92)

and

e = cos x  sin y
b = sin x + cos y .

(93)

these conditions are precisely those found in [13] to be
associated with 1/4 supersymmetry. when they are sat-
ised, the 3-vectors e and b are independent of 4 and
5. the energy of the minimal energy conguration on
the t 2-wrapped m5-brane is therefore proportional to
the expression (41) for the energy of a 1/4 supersymmet-
ric dyon on the d3-brane.

the 1/4 supersymmetric dyons discussed earlier thus
aquire an m-theory interpretation as intersections on the
m5-brane of two string boundaries of two m2-branes.
when the two m2-branes intersect orthogonally, so do
the strings. this maps to a iib conguration composed
of two orthogonal bion spikes that are also othogonal in
charge space. a rotation of the m2-branes away from or-
thogonality preserving 1/4 supersymmetry corresponds
to a simultaneous rotation (of one membrane relative to
the other) by the same angle in the m5-brane and in
the space transverse to it. this corresponds in the iib
theory to a simultaneous rotation by the same angle in
transverse space and charge space.

we can now nd nite energy 1/4 supersymmetric soli-
tons on the m5-brane by the procedure described earlier,
but we should mention that the relation between the
1/4 supersymmetric m5-brane solitons and the string-
junction dyons on the d3-brane is straightforward only
in the case of the innite energy solutions, in a at back-
ground, because in general the harmonic function u of
the m5-brane background is not the same as the har-
monic function h of the d3-brane background. the m5-
brane transverse space is only ve-dimensional whereas
it is six-dimensional for the d3-brane.

we should also mention that there is more than one
possible interpretation of d3-brane dyons as m5-brane
solitons. recall that the 6-space transverse to the d3-
brane is reduced to a 5-space transverse to the m5-brane.
this leads one to wonder what the m-theory interpreta-
tion is of a d3-brane bion with its spike in this sixth
dimension. if the d3-brane bion is purely magnetic then
the answer is that it corresponds to a marginal bound
state of the m5-brane with an m-wave travelling along
it. if we compactify along the direction of the wave then
we get a d0-brane on a d4-brane of iia superstring the-
ory. this has a t-dual in iib superstring theory as a
d-string ending on a d3-brane, which is an electric bion

from the perspective of the d3-brane worldvolume. one
gets an electric d3-brane bion from the same m-theory
conguration by reducing along another direction in the
m5-brane orthogonal to the m-wave. this leads to a
wave on a d4-brane. t-dualizing along the wave direc-
tion yields the desired conguration.

vii. discussion

we have seen that nite energy congurations of iib
superstring theory in which (m, n) strings are suspended
between d3-branes can be found as 1/2 or 1/4 supersym-
metric solitons on a test d3-brane in a supergravity d3-
brane background, the 1/4 supersymmetric solitons hav-
ing a natural interpretation in terms of string junctions.
these solitons are abelian analogues of the nite energy
supersymmetric solitons of d = 4 n = 4 sym theory.
there are similar 1/2 and 1/4 supersymmetric solitons on
a test m5-brane in a supergravity m5-brane background,
related by dualities to those on the d3-brane. in our ex-
position of these results we glossed over a few points, and
we shall conclude with a brief discussion of them.

the rst point has to do with whether the bion solu-
tions we have have found are really non-singular. con-
sider the one bion solution in which the sphere in e3 of
radius r0 is mapped by x(r) to the centre x = l of
the background metric. the induced worldspace metric
near r = r0 was given as ds2
3 in (29), with u = r  r0.
the corresponding worldvolume metric is, for q = 1 and
after a constant rescaling of the time coordinate,

ds2

u (cid:19)2
4 = u2dt2 +(cid:18) du

+ l2u2d2
2 .

(94)

the submanifold with d2
2 = 0 is just ads2, with u = 0
a killing horizon of t. this is at innite proper distance
on spacelike geodesics of constant t but at nite ane
parameter on timelike or null geodesics. this is not un-
expected because the singularity of the spacetime metric
at its centres are also killing horizons at nite ane pa-
rameter on timelike or null geodesics. however, although
the singularity at u = 0 is just a coordinate singularity
of ads2, it is a curvature singularity of the full 4-metric
(94) because the 2-spheres at constant u shrink to points
at u = 0.

it is not clear to us whether this is really a problem be-
cause there are no test particles on the d3-brane moving
on timelike geodesics in this worldvolume metric. if we
were to consider the time dependent problem in which
a wave on the d3-brane scatters from a bion then we
would have to rst solve the dbi equations for this prob-
lem and then recompute the worldvolume metric.
in
general, one would expect the result to dier from the
static bion metric of (94), which would be of direct rel-
evance to the time-dependent problem only if all scalar
uctuations were to vanish. it seems unlikely that the
dbi equations will have such solutions when linearized

11

about the static bion conguration (rather than about
the minkowski vacuum) but we have not investigated this
in detail. the whole area of time-dependent scattering
solutions involving bions deserves a separate study.

a second point concerns the string junction interpre-
tation of the 1/4 supersymmetric dbi dyons on the d3-
brane. recall that this involves, in the case of a at
background, singularities of two harmonic functions x
and y at points with e3 coordinates 1 and 2. near
either singularity, and far from both, the solution is ap-
proximately that of a single 1/2 supersymmetric bion.
the term far from here refers to a region in which
the distance from either singularity (in the e3 metric)
is much larger than |1  2|. the larger |1  2| is,
the further out is this region and the smaller is the de-
viaton of the worldspace metric from the euclidean met-
ric. thus, for large |1  2| it is more natural to inter-
pret the worldspace conguration as one for which two
strings meet the d3-brane at widely separated points.
only as the separation of these points decreases does the
string junction interpretation become the natural one.
even in this case one could interpret the deviation of the
worldspace from the euclidean metric as that required to
support two strings meeting the d3-brane at the points
1 and 2, just as the single bion solution has the alter-
native interpretation as the deviation required to support
an attached string [10,18], rather than as the string itself.
