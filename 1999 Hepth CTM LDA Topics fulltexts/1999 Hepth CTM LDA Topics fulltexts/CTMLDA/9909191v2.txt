abstract

we show that the requirement of s3  spin(d) in-
variance for an asymptotically free su (3)-cartan
subalgebra wave-function does not give a unique can-
didate for a su (3)-invariant zero energy state of the
d = 9 supersymmetric matrix model nor does it
rule out the existence of such a state in the case
d = 3. for d = 9 we explicitly construct various
s3  spin(9)-invariant wave-functions.

due to coherent evidence1 that, asymptotically, a zero energy state of
a su (n )-invariant supersymmetric matrix model in d = 3, 5 or 9 dimen-
sions factorizes into a part involving only the cartan subalgebra degrees of
freedom (with eectively free dynamics) and a part forming supersymmetric
harmonic oscillators, the following wishful conjecture appeared:

cw: for each n  2, and d = 9, the free laplacian (times the unit operator
in a 2(n 1)(d1)-dimensional fock space) admits exactly one spin(d)  sn
invariant wavefunction (where sn denotes the permutation group of n let-
ters) which is square integrable at  and harmonic everywhere except at
the origin, whereas for d = 5 and 3 no such function exists.

if true, cw would provide further evidence for the global existence of a
unique (normalizable) zero energy state for d = 9, and (assuming eectively
free dynamics for the cartan subalgebra part) prove the nonexistence of a
global zero energy state for d = 3 and 5.

for n = 2, the d = 9 part of cw is implied by [4], [5], while the

nonexistence for d = 3 and 5 was proven in [6], [3].

in this note we shall prove cw to be wrong (for n = 3), by explicit
construction of ve linearly independent s3  spin(9)-invariant, and one
s3  spin(3)-invariant, wave-functions.

for n = 3, the ingredients are the tensor product of two copies of a

2d1-dimensional fock space h, each decomposing as

h4 = {1}  {1}  {2}
h16 = {1}  {1}  {1}  {5}  {4}  {4}
h256 = {44}  {84}  {128}

under spin(d), respectively (where we write {n} for an irreducible represen-
tation space of dimension n), and the space of all harmonic polynomials in
2d variables z = (x, y) where za =: xa for a  d and za =: yad for a > d.
an arbitrary harmonic polynomial of degree l takes the form

h(z) = x1a1al2d

each homogeneous harmonic polynomial of degree l may be multiplied by
r2l(2d2) (to ensure a square integrable fall-o at ), without losing har-
monicity away from the origin.
the weyl group for su (n ) is known to be the symmetric group sn ,
which for n = 3 has only three pairwise inequivalent irreducible repre-
sentations, namely the trivial representation in a one-dimensional module
(denoted by {1}), the alternating representation by the sign of the per-
mutations in a one-dimensional module (denoted by ), and the standard
representation in a two dimensional module (denoted by ) which in some
orthonormal basis takes the following form:

c = 1

where c and c 2 denote the two nontrivial cyclic permutations and p, p , p 
denote the three transpositions. taking traces, the characters of the above
irreducible representations are easily computed to take the following values
on the three conjugacy classes {1}, {c, c 2}, and {p, p , p }:

for 1 : 1,
for 
: 1,
for  : 2, 1,

in the sequel we shall identify the characters with the equivalence class of
irreducible representations they dene.

the generators of (the lie algebra of) spin(d) can be represented in
fermionic fock space c(d1)(n 1) as operators in the following way where
sd := 4, 8, 16 for d = 3, 5, 9):

spin(3)-representations, and one 3-dimensional one spanned by

four 2-dimensional

(9)

while the one-dimensional spaces spanned by 11, 22, and 12 + 21,
respectively, are isomorphic to  under s3, the remaining two spin(3)-
singlets span a s3-module isomorphic to  with basis

on the other hand one can easily check that the two so(3)-scalars ~x2  ~y2
and 2~x  ~y transform the same way under the two transpositions p and p 
(hence, under s3) as |1i and |2i. therefore

d=3(~x, ~y) :=

thus disproving the d = 3 part of cw.

for d = 9, things are somewhat more complicated: while the decompo-
sitions into irreducible spin(9)-modules in the tensor product of two copies

of the fermionic fock space can be computed using the formulas (where we
agree upon writing m{n} for the direct sum of m copies of the irreducible
module {n})2.

formation properties under s3 are more dicult to obtain: according to the
general theory of compact lie groups this would amount to a ner decom-
position of the above space into tensor products of irreducible s3-modules
with irreducible spin(9)-modules; note however that there is only one (!)
9-dimensional representation on the right hand sides of the previous six
equations (which, therefore, must be equivalent either to {1}  {9} or to
  {9}).

to obtain this, we rst used the decomposition into irreducible spin(9)-

as well as the decomposition into irreducible s3-submodules (using    =
{1}    , see the character table (7)):

sym3(r9  r9) = 165{1}  165  405

(22)

where these have to be distributed among (20) (which turns out to be doable
by just counting dimensions); nally, one of the emerging   {9} modules
had to be dropped, as it corresponds to the submodule spanned by the
r2xa and r2ya (1  a  9) which does not contain any nonzero harmonic
functions. in any case, as (19) contains both {1}  {9} and   {9}, the
single spin(9)-submodule of dimension 9 in the fermionic sector (18) no
matter whether it is of type {1}{9} or {9}can be matched in the nal
tensor products of bosons and fermions to form a s3  spin(9) invariant
wave function of the form

(z) = r22

9

xs=1

s(z)|9; si

(23)

where the |9; si form an orthonormal basis of the {9}-module in (18) and
the s form an orthonormal basis of the module of the same type in the
space of harmonic cubic polynomials.

one could be tempted to deduce that this must be the cartan subalgebra
factor in the asymptotic form of the d = 9, n = 3 zero energy wave-function.
however, at least (!) four other s3  spin(9) candidate wave-functions exist
(thus disproving the uniqueness of the d = 9 part of cw); to see this,
replace 9 by 156 in the previous argument (which gives the second invariant
ground state), or consider the space of all quartic harmonic polynomials,
which after some work can be concluded to decompose into

sym4

harm(r18) = {1}  {450}  2  {450}    {910}    {910}

now note that the r.h.s of eqs (13)-(18) contains three spin(9)-submodules

of dimension 495. the submodule of dimension 128 in (3) consists of all
forms of odd degree over r8 (see e.g.
[5]) whereas the two submodules of
dimension 44 and 84 give all corresponding forms of even degree. it follows
that the transposition p  s3, which maps (, ) to (,), is equal
to the identity on the two irreducible modules of dimension 495 contained
in (13) and (15) since they imply even forms in  and  separately, whereas
it is equal to minus identity on the irreducible module of dimension 495
contained in (18) since it consists of forms which are odd both in  and
in . out of the 6 apriori possibilities to decompose the sum of the three
modules of dimension 495 into irreducibles under s3  spin(9), the two not
containing {1}  {495}, namely   {495}    {495} and 3  {495}, are
therefore impossible, as their +1-eigenspace under p would be too small.
therefore the fermionic sector contains at least one s3 spin(9)-submodule
of type {1}  {495} that can be matched with the irreducible submodule of
dimension 495 in (24) in the same manner as in the cubic case (see (23)),
viz.

(z) = r24

495

xs=1

s(z)|495; si

(25)

where the |495; si form an orthonormal basis of the {1}  {495}-module in
the fermionic sector and the s form an orthonormal basis of the module of
the same type in the space of harmonic quartic polynomials. the s can all
be chosen out of the quartic polynomials taking the following form3:

s(x, y) = x c(s)

a1a2a3a4(xa1 xa2 

1
9

xaxaa1a2)(ya3 ya4 

1
9

yayaa3a4) (26)

where c(s) is a tracless tensor of rank four in r9, corresponding to the young
diagram . this will give a third candidate for the cartan subalgebra factor
of an asymptotic zero-energy state of the d = 9 su (3) matrix model.

a fourth candidate is obtained by noting that the decomposition (24)
contains the three pairwise nonequivalent irreducible s3  spin(9)-modules
{1}  {44},   {44}, and   {44}. according to eqs (13), (15), and (18)
3note that the weyl-invariant 450-dimensional representation (450) occurring in (24)
is of the form cstuv(xsxtxuxv + ysytyuyv + 2xsxtyuyv) with cstuv totally symmetric and
traceless; contracting it with the unique, weyl-invariant, 450-dimensional representation
formed out of the fermions, yields yet another s3  spin(9)-invariant wavefunction.

6

the fermionic sector contains two of these modules which again match to at
least two s3  spin(9)-invariant states of the form

(z) = r24

44

xs=1

s(z)|44; si

(27)

with the obvious notations.

last, but not the least, consider the space of all quadratic harmonic

polynomials which decomposes as

sym2

harm =   {1}    {44}  {1}  {44}    {36}

(28)

under s3  spin(9) (corresponding to the space spanned by ~x2  ~y2 and
2~x  ~y, the space of polynomials p cab(xaxb  yayb) and p cab(xayb) with
c symmetric traceless, the space of polynomials p cab(xaxb + yayb) with
c symmetric traceless, and the space of polynomials p dab(xayb) with d
antisymmetric, respectively). again, one of the above modules containing
{44} as a factor can be matched with an equivalent fermionic one, as at
least one of the two fermionic modules containing {44} as a factor is not
isomorphic to {44}: otherwise all the three spin(9)-modules of type {44}
in (13), (15), and (18) would have to change sign under the transposition
p which is not the case for the two modules of type {44} in (13) and (15),
compare the discussion of {495}.

finally, note that while h = 0 implies q = 0 if q is hermitean
and h = q2, care is needed when looking at the corresponding dierential
equations only asymptotically, or when deriving eective operators (as done
in [1]). as stressed by a.smilga [1, 8], it may well be that the additional
condition qe  = 0 will single out a unique d = 9 wave-function and/or
exclude any d = 3, 5 sn  spin(d)-wave-function. it should be easy to test
this using our s3  spin(d)-invariant wave-functions.

note added: it is easy to see that neither (27){1}{44} (nor (25)), nor
r24 times the {1}  {1} in (24) times a weyl invariant singlet formed out
of the fermions, cf. (13)-(18), nor r24 (450)
stuv |stuvi can be supersymmetric:
just note that each of the free supercharges is a sum of two terms, the rst

of which changes the number of s by 1, and squares to the x-laplacian,
while the second, squaring to the y-laplacian, does not contain  nor .
