abstract

in this paper, relying on previous results of one of us on harmonic analysis,
we derive the complete spectrum of osp(3|4)  su (3) multiplets that one obtains
compactifying d=11 supergravity on the unique homogeneous space n 0,1,0 that has
a tri-sasakian structure, namely leads to n = 3 supersymmetry both in the four
dimensional bulk and on the threedimensional boundary. as in previously analyzed
cases the knowledge of the kaluza klein spectrum, together with general information
on the geometric structure of the compact manifold is an essential ingredient to
guess and construct the corresponding superconformal eld theory. this is work in
progress. as a bonus of our analysis we derive and present the explicit structure of
all unitary irreducible representations of the superalgebra osp(3|4) with maximal
spin content smax  2.

1 introduction

in the last two years, since the rst proposals by j. maldacena [1] and witten [2], the
studies on the ads/cf t correspondence between superconformal eld theories on the
boundary adsp+2 of p + 2dimensional anti de sitter space and bulk supergravity on
adsp+2  x dp2 were developed in an extraordinarily large literature. for an overview
of the eld, we just refer to the extensive review [3] and to all references therein.
in
the beginning attention has mainly concentrated on the case p = 3, d = 10 where
one can gain non trivial information on the infrared conformal xed point of d = 4
supersymmetric gauge theories from d3branes and kaluza klein compactications of
type iib supergravity on suitable compact 5manifolds x 5. besides the case x 5 = s 7
that leads to n = 4 yang mills on the boundary, there is just one instance of homogeneous
5manifold, namely x 5 = t 1,1, that leads to n = 1 yang mills. for this case, where
the superconformal eld theory was proposed by klebanov and witten [4], a complete
comparison with the kaluza klein analysis was given in the spring of this year by ceresole,
dauria, dallagata and ferrara in [5]. since the beginning of this year, however, interest
has developed on the p = 2, d = 11 case where information can be gained on three
dimensional conformal eld theories from m2branes and kaluza klein compactications
of d = 11 supergravity on ads4  x 7.
in this context one can rely on a wealth of
results built up in the early eighties when kaluza klein supergravity was very topical in
a totally dierent perspective (see [6] for an overview). in particular as a very signicant
heritage from that scientic season we have: a) the complete classication of compact
homogeneous 7-manifolds g/h that can be used as internal dimensions, together with
their number of unbroken supersymmetries n(g/h) [7], b)the development of systematic
algebraic techniques in harmonic analysis [8] [9],[10],[11],[12] to derive the kaluza klein
massspectra [13] , c) the algebraic technology [14, 15, 16] to construct and classify the
unitary irreducible representations (uir.s) of the osp(n|4) superalgebras, whose role in
kaluza klein supergravity was rst pointed out in [17].
although large, the heritage of the eighties is incomplete in two respects: 1) the struc-
ture of all long and short osp(n|4) multiplets relevant to kaluza klein mass spectra 1
was not entirely determined, 2) the harmonic analysis and the spectra of all supersymmet-
ric g/h 7manifolds had not been calculated in an exhaustive way, only partial results
existing in that literature. [9, 11, 18, 19]. in the last year a programme has been carried
through [20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26] that aims at completing the kaluza klein spectra of
all supersymmetric homogeneous 7manifolds and deriving the corresponding supercon-
in [20] the kk spectrum of the manifold m 1,1,1 was
formal eld theories in d = 3.
determined and those results of harmonic analysis were also used to derive the complete
structure of osp(2|4) supermultiplets. this made it possible to perform a general study
of the 3d superconformal eld theories associated with sasakian 7manifolds and make a
detailed comparison between kaluza klein spectra and the spectra of composite conformal
operators on the boundary. indeed the general geometric framework for the formulation
of such threedimensional scft.s was lead down in [22] where the m 1,1,1 and q1,1,1 cases
were explicitly constructed. in the rst case the comparison with kaluza klein results
was already available and showed perfect agreement together with new predictions. the
comparison for the q1,1,1 case has been done in a separate publication which is to appear
[25]. also here perfect agreement has been found; furthermore the analysis of the q1,1,1
1the supermultiplets relevant to kaluza klein theories are those with maximal spin state smax  2

theory has been extended in [28] to include also domain walls.

in the list of supersymmetric 7manifolds of [7] there is a unique case with 8 >
n > 2, namely the n = 3 manifold n 0,1,0  su(3)  su(2)/su(2)  u(1). this is a
particularly interesting case where the sasakian 7manifold is actually tri-sasakian, the
necessary geometric basis to realize n = 3 supersymmetry. furthermore since in d = 3
the n = 3 gauge and matter multiplets are automatically n = 4 multiplets the scft
associated with n 0,1,0 must be realized as a suitable deformation of an n = 4 gauge theory
which makes this unique case very interesting also in view of its very simple avor group
gf lavor = su(3). this was the motivation for a systematic completion of the harmonic
analysis also on this manifold, which was accomplished in [23].

in the present letter we use the results of [23] to obtain two results:

1. the general structure of long and short osp(3|4) supermultiplets with smax  2

together with their decomposition into osp(2|4) supermultiplets.

2. the specic su(3) representation assignment of the osp(3|4) supermultiplets actu-

ally appearing in the kaluza klein spectrum on n 0,1,0.

the rst point in the above list has a general algebraic validity and aims at the completion
of the missing results on uir.s of the osp(n|4) superalgebra. the second point, instead,
is instrumental to the construction of the n = 3 scft associated with n 0,1,0 which is
presently under study [24].

2 osp(3|4) multiplets
let us briey explain how the structure of the osp (3|4) multiplets has been obtained.
we have determined them by means of the following tools:

 the method of induced representations, as in [15, 16]
 the harmonic analysis of n 0,1,0 [23],
 the n = 3  n = 2 decomposition.

the rst tool gives the structure of long multiplets, the other two give the short multiplet
structures. representations of osp (3|4) are labeled by the representation of the maximal
compact subgroup so(2)eso(3)spinso(3)r  osp(3|4) to which the cliord vacuum
|e0, s0, j0 > is assigned. as anticipated by our notation this means to specify the energy
e0  r, the spin s0  z/2 and the rsymmetry representation j0  z/2 which we call
isospin. the representations are unitary, provided

e0  j0 + s0 + 1
or
e0 = j0,

s0 = 0.

(1)

(2)

if the unitarity bound is saturated, some states have vanishing norms and decouple, so
we have a shortened representation. these shortened representations are particularly
interesting from the viewpoint of the ads/cf t correspondence since they are bp s
states, dual to primary conformal operators of the boundary scft. these states are

2

annihilated by some combination of the osp (3|4) supercharges and the dual boundary
operators satisfy dierential supereld conditions [21].
we have short representations when

e0 = j0 + s0 + 1 or e0 = j0, s0 = 0.

(3)

we stress that there is another shortening mechanism of a completely dierent origin.
the creation operators that act on the cliord vacuum have isospin 0  j0  2. if the
isospin of the cliord vacuum is j0  2, the creation operators give rise to states with
isospin in the range j0  j  jcomposite  j0 + j. yet, in the case where j0 = 0, 1,
some of these states cannot appear. this mechanism is not related to an unitarity bound,
and these representations are not bp s stated of supergravity, nor primary conformal
operators on the boundary. then we call long the representations with e0 > s0 + j0 + 1,
even if j0 = 0, 1. in this context, the massless representations are the short ones with
j0 = 0 for the case of the massless graviton and gravitino multiplets and with j0 = 1 for
the case of the massless vector multiplets.
for convenience we adopt the following notations. we denote

sd (smax, e0, j0|3)

(4)

an uir of osp (3|4) with maximal spin smax, cliord vacuum energy and isospin e0, j0.
note that, dierently from [15], we use smax instead of the cliord vacuum spin s0. this
notation can be extended to all osp (n|4) representations: for example, we denote the
n = 2 uirs by
(5)

sd (smax, e0, y0|2) ,

where y0 is the cliord vacuum hypercharge.
the complete list of the osp (3|4) uirs with smax  2 is given below:

 long graviton multiplet sd (2, e0, j0|3) where e0 > j0 + 3/2, see table 1;
 long gravitino multiplet sd (3/2, e0, j0|3) where e0 > j0 + 1, see table 2;
 short graviton multiplet sd (2, j0 + 3/2, j0|3), see table 3;
 short gravitino multiplet sd (3/2, j0 + 1, j0|3), see table 4;
 short vector multiplet sd (1, j0, j0|3), see table 5.

note that there are no long vector multiplets, and no hypermultiplets at all.
the n = 3  n = 2 decompositions of the above multiplets, which is essential for the
construction of the dual superconformal eld theory on the adsboundary [24], are listed

for the case n = 2 the osp (2|4) uirs with smax  2 were determined in [20] relying on
harmonic analysis on the manifold m 1,1,1 plus previous partial results [15, 16, 14]. they
are 2:

 long graviton multiplet sd (2, e0, y0|2) where e0 > y0 + 2,

 long vector multiplet sd (1, e0, y0|2) where e0 > y0 + 1
 short graviton multiplet sd (2, y0 + 2, y0|2),
 short gravitino multiplet sd (3/2, y0 + 3/2, y0|2)
 short vector multiplet sd (1, y0 + 1, y0|2),
 hypermultiplet sd (1/2, y0, y0|2)  sd (1/2, y0,y0|2).

3 the n 0,1,0 spectrum

the multiplets presented in this paper are all the osp(3|4) multiplets that appear com-
pactifying d = 11 supergravity on ads4  n 0,1,0. they are obtained by using the kaluza
klein mass spectrum derived in [23] 3 together with the mass relations in [10, 27] and the
multiplet structure of the long n = 3 multiplets.
the procedure that we used is exactly the same as that employed in [20]. we repeat
here the essential steps. in [23] the masses were calculated of the spin-2 eld h, of all the
spin- 3
2 elds +,  and of all the spin 1-elds a, w, z. then for each spin-2 there is one
graviton multiplet. we ll the rest of the multiplet with the spin- 3
2 and spin-1 elds. the
2notice that the massless n = 2 graviton, gravitino and vector multiplets are the short ones with

manifold n 0,1,0

spin- 3
2 elds that are left over are the highest spin components of the gravitino multiplets.
we also ll them out with the spin-1 elds. the spin-1 that are nally left over are the
highest component elds of the vector multiplets. these latter are necessarily short since
there is no long vector multiplets for osp(3|4) as we have already explained.
this procedure gives the upper-spin parts (i.e. s  1) of the osp(3|4) multiplets. in
[23] also the masses of the elds l, s,  were calculated. these are the spin 1/2 elds
coming from the longitudinal part of the d = 11 gravitino , while s and  are spin zero
4. with this information we can also
elds coming from the trace part of internal metric gij
identify some of the spin zero and spin one half states occurring in the already predicted
multiplets, which provides an important consistency check on the whole deduction.

summarizing, the conclusion is that the information on the upper-spin components
that we have from [23] is sucient (apart from consistency checks) to ll out all the

multiplets. one just uses supersymmetry.
is however more convenient [22] to consider the osp(3|4) multiplets decomposed into
osp(2|4) multiplets (6) whose structure was derived in [20] and whose description as
constrained superelds is known from [21]. we use the notation of [23], where

3.2 short multiplets

there are the following short multiplets in the following su (3) representations:

 there is only one massive short graviton multiplet sd (j0 + 3/2, 2, j0) in each of
(12)

the representations:

m1 = k, m2 = k, k  1.

it has

e0 = k + 3/2, j0 = k.

(13)

 there is only one massive short gravitino multiplet sd (j0 + 1, 3/2, j0) in each of
(14)

the representations:

m1 = k, m2 = k + 3, k  0.

it has

e0 = k + 2, j0 = k + 1.

(15)

 there is only one massive short vector multiplet sd (j0, 1, j0) in each of the repre-
(16)

sentations:

m1 = k, m2 = k, k  2.

it has

e0 = k, j0 = k.

(17)

3.3 massless multiplets

the massless sector of the theory is composed by the following multiplets.

 there is one massless graviton multiplet in the representation:

it has

m1 = m2 = 0

e0 = 3/2, j0 = 0.

6

(18)

(19)

this multiplet has the standard eld content expected for the n = 3 supergravity
multiplet in fourdimensions, namely one massless graviton, three massless graviti-
nos that gauge n = 3 supersymmetry, three massless vector elds (organized in a
j0 = 1 adjoint representation of so(3)r) that gauge the r-symmetry and one spin
onehalf eld.

 there is one massless vector multiplet in each of the representations:

they have:

m1 = m2 = 1
m1 = m2 = 0 .

e0 = 1, j0 = 1.

(20)
(21)

(22)

the multiplet (20) contains the gauge vectors of the su (3) isometry. the multiplet
(21) is the betti multiplet [11], related to the nontrivial cohomology of n 0,1,0 in
degree two. the fact that there is just one betti multiplet is in perfect agreement
with the results of [22] where it was shown that h 2 (n 0,1,0) = z. all the kaluza
klein states are neutral with respect to the betti multiplet, but according to the
analysis of [22] we expect that the scft should contain nonperturbative baryon
states carrying betti charges which can be reinterpreted as 5branes wrapped on
supersymmetric 5cycles of n 0,1,0.

4 conclusive remarks

from the present algebraic analysis we conclude that, seen as an n = 2 theory obtained
from a sasakian 7manifold, the superconformal eld theory of n 0,1,0 contains the follow-
ing hypermultiplets5:

(23)

m1 = m2 = e0 = y0 = k ;

k  1.

which constitute the chiral ring of the model. following the ideas of [22] it is now a
geometric challenge for us to construct, starting from a suitable description of n 0,1,0 a
threedimensional gauge theory that reproduces this chiral ring and the rest of the kaluza
klein spectrum [24]. we also note that for the rst time in the history of the ads/cf t
correspondence the dual bulk supergravity is a gauged n = 3 lagrangian. as derived
and explained in [32] such lagrangians display a unique scalar geometry su(3, n)/su(3)
su(n)  u(1) and are xed by giving the number of massless vector multiplets n and
in our case the number of vector multiplets is
the gauge group structure constants.
n = 8 + 1 = 9 so that the scalar manifold is su(3, 9)/su(3)  su(9)  u(1) while the
gauge group is so(3)r  su(3)
