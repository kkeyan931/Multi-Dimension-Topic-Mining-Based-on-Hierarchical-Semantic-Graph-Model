(october 27, 1997; revised: september 1998)

developing recently proposed constructions for the description of particles

in the (1/2, 0)  (0, 1/2) representation space, we derive the second-order
equations. the similar ones were proposed in the sixties and the seventies

in order to understand the nature of various mass and spin states in the

representations of the o(4, 2) group. we give some additional insights into

this problem. the used procedure can be generalized for arbitrary number of

lepton families.

a correct equation for an adequate description of neutrinos was sought for a long

time [15]. this problem is, in general, connected with the problem of taking the mass-

less limit of relativistic equations. for instance, it has been known for a long time that one

cannot simply set the mass equal to zero in a manifestly covariant massive-particle equation,

in order to obtain the corresponding massless case, e. g., ref. [5a].

secondly, in the seventies the second-order equation in the 4-dimensional representation

of the o(4, 2) group was proposed by barut et al.

in order to solve the problem of the

mass splitting of leptons [68] and by fushchich et al., for describing various spin states in

this representation [9,10]. the equations (they proposed) may depend on two parameters.

recently we derived the barut-wilson equation on the basis of the rst principles [11].1

thirdly, we found the possibility of generalizations of the (1, 0)(0, 1) equations (namely,
the maxwells equations and the weinberg-tucker-hammer equations2) also on the basis of

1briey, the scheme for derivation of the equation

[i + 2  ] (x) = 0

(1)

is the following. first, apply the generalized ryder-burgard relation (see below, eq. (10)) and the

standard scheme for the derivation of relativistic wave equations [12, footnote # 1]. then form

the dirac 4-spinors; the left- and right parts of them are connected as follows:

l(p) = [1/2][

r(p) = [1/2][


r(p)]

2in general, the latter does not completely reduce to the former after taking the massless limit in

2

including two independent constants [13], cf. also [14]. this induced us to look inside the

problem on the basis of the rst principles; my research was started in [15].

in this paper, we rst apply the ahluwalia reformulation [12,16,17] of the majorana-

mclennan-case construct for neutrino [18,19] with the purpose of the derivation of relevant

equations, we recalled above.

the following denitions and postulates are used:

 the operators of the discrete symmetries are dened as follows: a) the space inversion

operator:

ss

[1/2] =

0

11

11

0 ,

0

i[1/2]

i[1/2]

is the 4  4 anti-diagonal matrix; b) the charge conjugation operator:

sc

[1/2] =

k ,

(6)

(7)

with k being the operation of complex conjugation; and (cid:16)[j](cid:17)h, h = (1)j+hh, h

being the wigner operator.

 the left- (l and [j]

r) and the right- (r and  [j]

l) spinors are transformed to

the frame with the momentum p (from the zero-momentum frame) as follows:

r(p) = r(p  p) r( p) = exp(+ j  ) r( p) ,
l(p) = l(p  p) l( p) = exp( j  ) l( p) .

(8a)

(8b)

r,l are the matrices for the lorentz boosts; j are the spin matrices for spin j, e. g.,

ref. [20];  are parameters of the given boost. if we restrict ourselves by the case of

bradyons they are dened, e. g., refs. [22,14], by means of:

cosh() =  =

[1/2] =

(11)

 is here the azimuthal angle related to p  0; in general, see the cited papers for the
notation.4

 one can form either dirac 4-spinors:
r(p)

uh(p) =

 ,

l(p)

vh(p) = 5uh(p) ,

(13)

or the second-type spinors [12], see also [26,28]:

3this name was introduced by d. v. ahluwalia when considering the (1, 0)  (0, 1) representa-
tion [14]. if one uses r(p) = l(p), cf. also [21,22], after application of the wigner rules
for the boosts of the 3-component objects to the momentum p, one immediately arrives at the

bargmann-wightman-wigner type quantum eld theory, ref. [23] (cf. also the old papers [2426]

and the recent papers [27,28]), in this representation. the reader can still reveal some terminolog-

ical obscurities in [14].

4in general, one can connect also 

l and 

l. with using the  matrix (see formulas (22a,b) in

ref. [12]):

l(p) =

(14)

or even more general forms of 4-spinors depending on the phase factors between their

left- and right- parts and helicity sub-spaces that they belong to. for the second-type

spinors, the author of ref. [12] proposed several forms of the eld operators, e. g.,

dl(x) =x z d3p

2ephs
(p) exp(+ip  x)i .

 (p)c(p) exp(ip  x)+

(15)

on the basis of these denitions on using the standard rules [12, footnote # 1] one can

derive:

 in the case 1 = 0, 2 =  the following equations are obtained for l(p) and

r = [1/2]

hence, the equations for the 4-spinors s,a

(16a)

(16b)

(17a)

5the phase factors  are dened by various constraints imposed on the 4-spinors (or corresponding

operators), e. g., the condition of the self/anti-self charge conjugacy gives  s,a

 = i. but, one
should still note that phase factors also depend on the phase factor in the denition of the charge

conjugation operator (7). the mass term of resulting dynamical equations may also be dierent.

a = (b  1) if we want to have p2

0  p2 = m2 for massive particles.

 we can write several forms of equations in the coordinate representation depending on
the relations between creation/annihilation operators. for instance, provided that we
imply d(p) = +ic(p) and d(p) = ic(p); the k operator acts on q numbers
as hermitian conjugation, the rst generalized equation in the coordinate space reads

"ia



m  (b  11)5ck# (x) = 0 .

transferring into the majorana representation one obtains two real equations:7

ia

m

1(x)  i(b  11)52(x) = 0 ,
2(x)  i(b  11)51(x) = 0 .

(18)

(19a)

(19b)

for real and imaginary parts of the eld function m r(x) = 1(x) + i2(x). in the

case of a = 1b and considering the eld function  = 1 + 2 we come to the sokolik
equation for the spinors of the second kind [26, eq.(8)] and ref. [28, eqs.(14,18)]. next,

we come to the second-order equation in the coordinate representation for massive

particles

m2 + (b  1)2#
"a2 

1(x)

2(x)

= 0 .

(20)

of course, it may be reduced to the klein-gordon equation. in general, there may

exist mass splitting between various cp conjugate states. we shall return to this
question in other papers.

7it seems that this procedure can be carried out for any spin, cf. [29].

6

 one can nd the relation between creation/annihilation operators for another equation

(1, 2  e)

"ia



m  ei115ck + ei22# (x) = 0 ,

which would be consistent with the equations (17a-17d).8 here they are:

(b  1)c = iei11d  iei22c ,
(b  1)c = iei11d + iei22c ,
(b  1)d
  iei22d
 ,
 + iei22d
(b  1)d
 .

 = iei11c
 = iei11c

(21)

(22a)

(22b)

(22c)

(22d)

the condition of the compatibility ensures that 2 = 0,  and 2

2 = (b  1)2. we
assumed that two annihilation operators are linear independent. if 1 = 0, we recover

1 + 2

the dirac equation but with additional constraints put on the creation/annihilation

operators, c = ic and d = id. the phase phactor 1 remains unxed at this
stage.

in the majorana representation the resulting set of the real equations are

"ia
"ia


m


+ i1 sin 15 + 2# 1  i1 cos 152 = 0 ,
m  i1 sin 15 + 2# 2  i1 cos 151 = 0 .

for instance in the 1 = 

2 we obtain

"ia
"ia


m


+ i15 + 2# 1 = 0 ,
m  i15 + 2# 2 = 0 .

(23a)

(23b)

(24a)

(24b)

8as one can expect from this consideration the equation (21) may be reminiscent of the works of

the 60s, refs. [35,30].

7

but, in any case one can recover the klein-gordon equation for both real and imaginary

parts of the eld function, eq. (20). it is not yet clear, if the constructs discussed

recently in ref. [30] are permitted.

 but, we are able to consider other constraints on the creation/annihilation operators,
introduce various types of elds operators (as in [13]) and/or generalize even more the

ryder-burgard relation (see footnote # 4 of the present paper, for instance). in the

general case, we suggest to start from

(a bp
m  11)uh(p) + ib(1)

1

2 h5cu

h(p) = 0 ;

(25)

i. e., the equation (11) of [11]. but, as opposed to the cited paper, we write the

coordinate-space equation in the form:

"a

i

m

+ b1 ck  11# (x) + b25cke(x) = 0 ,

(26)

thus introducing the third parameter. then we can perform the same procedure as in

ref. [11]. implying m r = 1 + i2 and em r = 3 + i4, one obtains real equations

in the majorana representation

i

(a

(a

for  = 1 + 2,  = 1  2 and e = 3 + 4, e = 3  4. after algebraic

transformations we have:

the third-order equations. however, the eld operator e may be linear dependent on
the states included in the . so, relations may exist between 3,4 and 1,2. if we
apply the most simple (and accustomed) constraints 1 = i54 and 2 = i53
one should recover the dirac-barut-like equation with three mass eigenvalues:

"i  m

(29)

thus, we can conclude that as in several previous works we observe that the physical

results depend on the stage where one applies the relevant constraints. furthermore,

we apparently note that the similar results can be obtained by consecutive applications

of the generalized ryder-burgard relations.

as indicated by barut himself, several ways for introdcution of interaction with 4-

vector potential exist in second-order equations. only considering the correct one

(and, probably, taking into account 5 axial currents introduced in [17]), we shall be

able to answer the question of why the 2 parameter of the barut works is xed by

means of the use of the classical value of anomalous magentic moments; and on what

physical basis we have to x other parameters we introduced above.

in conclusion, we presented a very natural way of deriving the massive/massless equations

in the (1/2, 0)(0, 1/2) representation space, which leads to those given by other researchers
in the past. it is known that present-day neutrino physics has come across serious diculties.

no experiment and observation are in agreement with theoretical predictions of the standard

model. furthermore, baruts way of solving the hierarchy problem was almost forgotten,

in spite of its simplicity and beauty. in fact, an idea of imposing certain relations between

convective and rotational motions of a fermion is much more physical than all other modern-

fashioned models. it may be very fruitful, because as we have shown previously and here, the

(j, 0)  (0, j) representation spaces have a very rich internal structure. i hope the question
of whether proposed equations have some relevance to the description of the physical world,

will be solved in the near future.
