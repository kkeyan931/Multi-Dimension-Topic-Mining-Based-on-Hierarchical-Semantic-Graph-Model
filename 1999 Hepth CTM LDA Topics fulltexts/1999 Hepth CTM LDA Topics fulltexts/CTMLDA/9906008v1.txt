abstract

the thoofts 5n -parametric multiinstanton solution is generalized to curvilinear
coordinates. expressions can be simplied by the gauge transformation that makes
-symbols constant in the vierbein formalism. this generates the compensating
addition to the gauge potential of pseudoparticles. typical examples (4-spherical,
2 + 2- and 3 + 1-cylindrical coordinates) are studied and explicit formulae presented
for reference. singularities of the compensating eld are discussed. they are irrel-
evant for physics but aect gauge dependent quantities.

introduction

instantons form an essential nonperturbative element of nonabelian gauge theories applied
in physics of strong and weak interactions. but despite a signicant knowledge that was
acquired since the pioneering paper [1] the topic is not exhausted yet. among others the
question of the role of instantons in quark connement remains unsettled. probably the
problem will not be solved unless new methods and ideas appear. reviews of the current
state of aairs can be found in [2, 3].

usually instantons are studied in the innite 4-dimensional euclidean space paramet-
rized by cartesian coordinates. a demand for non-cartesian coordinates rst came from
investigation of anomalies and index theorems on manifolds with boundaries. adaptation
of existing results (see [4, 5]) to practical problems requires explicit formulae.

a promising direction would be to examine pseudoparticles in connement models such
as the qcd-string or a mit-bag. however cartesian coordinates are not the best choice
for such objects. for example strings looks more natural in (2 + 2)-cylindrical coordinates
while a (3 + 1)-frame may be convenient for the bag. studies of pseudoparticles against
nonuniform backgrounds may require even more imagination.

a notable progress in the instanton physics was associated with exact multiinstanton
solutions. the general solution [6] proved too complicated and many physicists preferred
the convenient thoofts ansatz [7]. most of instanton-based models start from pseudo-
particles in singular gauge that are the specic case of this solution. an advantage of the
ansatz is that it makes possible to calculate exact green functions in multipseudoparticle
eld [8]. besides it provides a way to study qcd at nonzero temperature [9, 10] and
quark density [11].

the purpose of the present paper is to develop a simple approach to thoofts multi-
pseudoparticle solution in curvilinear coordinates. this oers a chance to benet from its
advantages preserving spatial symmetry of other objects. this would simplify calculations
and widen the research eld.

a basic component of the cartesian thoofts solution are the so-called -symbols
(-tensors) that project (anti-) selfdual tensors onto the su(2) gauge group, [12]. be-
ing transformed to other coordinates -symbols loose their simple form. our idea is to
consider instead of them the -symbols that are literal analogues of s in the vierbein
formalism. the -symbols can be made constant by a gauge transform related to the
metric tensor. the resulting 5n-parametric gauge potential is the sum of the thoofts
multiinstanton and the compensating eld. the latter may be found by a simple calcu-
lation. after discussing general aspects we illustrate the idea by an example and derive
explicit formulae for two typical cases. it turns out that the compensating potential may
exhibit singularities that aect gauge dependent quantities.

the paper has the following structure. we start from reminding the basics: sect. 1
introduces the thoofts ansatz while sect. 2 deals with curvilinear coordinates. section 3
is dedicated to the compensating gauge connection. first we calculate the compensating
gauge potential and then discuss the relation between - and -symbols. after that we
turn to pseudoparticles in non-cartesian frame in sect. 4. we calculate vector potentials
and gauge eld strengths for a general n-instanton conguration and for an instanton in
singular and regular gauges1.

section 5 presents a detailed study of an instanton in 4-spherical coordinates. we
calculate explicitly the (gauged) pseudoparticle elds in singular and regular gauges and
obtain the same result provided that the instanton is at the origin. this may serve an
indication in favour of the approach. the calculation of the chern-simons number reveals
that being gauge dependent it feels the singularity of the compensating eld. in section 6
we compute the compensating connection for (2 + 2)- and (3 + 1)-cylindrical coordinates.
the results are summarized in the conclusion.

1 instantons in singular and regular gauges.

this section reviews basic facts on instantons in 4-dimensional euclidean space. for time
being we shall focus on cartesian coordinates and make no distinction between upper and
lower indices. we shall consider a yang-mills theory with the su(2) gauge group. the
action of the gauge eld is:

s = z d4x

)2
(f a
4g2 =

4g2 z d4x (aa

  aa

 + abcab

ac

)2.

(1)

vector potential is denoted by aa
 with  = 1, . . . , 4 and a = 1, 2, 3 being the lorentz and
group indices respectively. throughout the paper we shall use for gauge elds the matrix
notation. the covariant derivative in fundamental representation is:

d =   i a =  

i

 aaa
,

(2)

1 more precisely our solutions coincide with those in cartesian coordinates

2

where  a are pauli matrices and hats indicate matrices. later we shall introduce the
levi-civita and spin connections that are absent in cartesian coordinates. commutator
of the covariant derivatives gives the eld strength:

f =

1
2

 a f a

 = i [d, d] .

(3)

classical equations for aa

 have instanton, or pseudoparticle, solutions. instantons are
characterized by their topological properties: their eld is selfdual, (a), and has the unit
topological charge, (b):

f i

 =

1

 f i

(a);

322 z d4x  tr f i



f i

 = 1,

(b).

(4)

in addition to instantons there exist anti-instantons. anti-instanton eld f a

 is anti-
selfdual and has the topological charge 1, i. e. the signs of the right hand side of the
equations (4) must be reversed. from here on we shall speak mostly about instantons
indicating generalization to anti-instantons if necessary.

instanton eld depends on gauge. the two most popular are regular and singular
gauges. the elds of instantons of radius  centered at x0 are (up to uniform gauge
rotations):

their properties can be found in [12] or obtained directly from the matrix representation

in practical calculations it is convenient to make use of the two hermitean conjugated

sets of 2  2 matrices (latin indices stand for the three spatial dimensions):

the following equations relate ,  

 to -symbols:

another way to derive (5b) is to carry out the inversion, x  x 2/x2. however
the latter changes the orientation of the coordinate system and converts instanton to
anti-instanton. this is corrected by the    replacement.
singular gauge has several practical advantages. gauge potentials fall rapidly and
pseudoparticles are almost independent. generalization to multipseudoparticle congu-
rations is done simply by adding extra pieces to (x):

sing(x)  n (x) = 1 +

n

xi=1

i

(x  xi)2 ,

(12)

i and xi being radii and positions of pseudoparticles. this solution bears the name of
the thoofts ansatz, [7]. it depends on 5n parameters {xi, i} and does not allow for
independent gauge rotations of instantons. but the lack of generality is balanced by the
extreme handiness.

2 curvilinear coordinates.

in order to distinguish curvilinear coordinates from the cartesian ones we shall denote
them by q, q etc. the metric tensor is now g(q),

ds2 = dx2

 = g(q) dq dq.

(13)

the metric g(q) and its inverse g(q) = [g(q)]1 are used for raising and lowering
indices: a = ga; a = ga.

let us start from elds that are singlet with respect to the gauge group. covariant

derivatives of vectors are taken with the help of the levi-civita connection 

:

da = a + 

a;

and

da = a  

a;

(14)

the latter is unambiguously dened by the condition that the metric tensor is covariantly
constant, dg = 0.

(15)

the metric g may be decomposed into vierbeins ea

 (from here on we reserve latin
indices for the latter). let ab be the at euclidean metric, ab = ab = diag (1, 1, 1, 1).
then

g(q) = ab ea

(q) eb

(16)
a. raising and lowering of
one may convert spatial indices into vierbein ones, aa = ea
the latter is performed by means of the tensors : aa = abab and aa = abab. the
inverse of the vierbein is e

covariant derivatives of quantities with vierbein indices are dened in terms of the

spin connection ra

daa = aa + ra

and

daa = aa  ab rb

(18)

vierbeins are covariantly constant and this xes the spin connection. solving the equation

a = e

the matrices r are antisymmetric with respect to the exchange a  b. (this follows from

the o(4) group, (lmn)a

the last thing is to extend the spin connection and covariant derivative to spin- 1

elds. we would like matrices a with latin indices to be covariantly constant. it is easy
to see that if we dene -matrices and their commutators so that

(19)

now let us turn to gauge elds in curvilinear coordinates. one may dene a and  
a
matrices with vierbein indices by analogy with (8). we shall show that it is possible to
introduce a compensating gauge eld such that either a 
ab is covariantly constant.
the compensating eld turns out to be a pure gauge provided that the space is at.

in order to escape confusion we shall use only ab that are just constant numerical matrices.

the separate blocks that:

parts of the spin connection rab
 onto the su(2) gauge group. in general only one of the
bilinears  
b can be made covariantly constant by the appropriate choice of the
compensating eld. the equations (28) are the most straightforward way to calculate a.

well.)

(33)

this denes the 2  2 matrices + and  up to the left multiplication by a constant
nondegenerate matrix u:   u . however the freedom may be eliminated by requiring
that  gauge rotated  into .
let us rewrite the condition of ab being covariantly constant, (27), in cartesian coor-

dinates. it will read (presently we may drop the -superscripts):

d

(x) = d

that is equivalent to

ab1 is a constant tensor that projects selfdual (or antiselfdual
we conclude that  ea
respectively) antisymmetric tensors onto the su(2) group (see appendix). hence it must
be equal (up to a gauge rotation) to the corresponding . uniform gauge rotations do
not aect the compensating elds (33) and we may x  up to a phase factor ei by
demanding that:

ab1(cid:17) = const.

(cid:16) ea

ab = 1 

or

 ab = e

a e

b .

(36)

the question is whether there are solutions to these equations. one may gure out
the two conditions. first, the both sides of (36) must be normalized in the same way. in
order to prove this we take the square of the rst equation:

 eb
ea



ab ec  ed  cd = 1   .

(37)

this results into identity ab

ab =   = 12. thus the rst condition is fullled.

however this does not guarantee existence of solutions. it is necessary that both sides
of the equations were of same duality. this is the case if the two sets a and e
a dier
by a rotation and/or an even permutation.2 (another way is to say that the change of
variables must respect parity.) gauge transformations do not interfere with duality and
it suce to check the equivalence of (36) to their duals,

ab = 1 

 

or

 

ab =

 .

(38)

a well-known example of a parity violating procedure is inversion q = x/x2 that may
be implemented to derive the singular gauge, (5b) from the regular one, (5a). in order to
restore duality altered by the inversion the substitution    is necessary.

2although gauge transformation rotate the traceless pauli  -matrices into each other, they do not

aect the 4-matrix. hence permutations can not be reduced to gauge transforms.

4 instanton with the compensating eld.

a naive way to transform an instanton to curvilinear coordinates would be simply to
change variables: x  q and a  a = a (x/q). it is more convenient however
to accompany this by one of the previously discussed gauge rotations. let us begin with
the singular gauge, (5b), that contains the antiselfdual symbol 
. this dictates the
choice of the matrix  for the transformation. the combined change of variables and
gauge transform give:

with the help of the relations (33) and (36) this may be immediately reduced to

(41)

an interesting feature of the expressions (40, 41) is that they do not contain  ex-
plicitly. one needs only a
 which may be found directly from (28). that is much easier
than solving (36) for . from here on we shall omit the superscript  in a
 (q). in fact if
the sign of the topological charge is not crucial one may apply the formulae (40, 41) and
(28) without checking duality properties of ab and  e

a e
b .

the duality equation, (4a), in the non-cartesian frame takes the form

f =

(42)

(43)

we shall calculate the eld strength in two ways. first we shall derive a general
expression that works in multiinstanton case as well. then we shall demonstrate that for
one pseudoparticle the formulae do simplify both in regular and singular gauges.
first of all let us notice that we may keep the levi-civita connection 

 in the
covariant derivative since it will drop out of the nal result. for brevity we shall denote
the rst addends in the right hand sides of (40, 41) by ai

(i. e. n+ = i) so that (53) and (55) coincide.

only dierence is that one has to interchange +

5 instanton in o(4)-spherical coordinates.

in order to show how the general theory works we shall apply it to the familiar case.
let us derive explicit formulae for one instanton placed at the origin of the 4-dimensional
spherical coordinates. the example happens to be instructive and reveals two unexpected
features. first, it turns out that (in this particular setting) our prescription converts
pseudoparticles both in singular and regular gauges to the same form. in a sense this is
an evidence in favor of the approach. second, the compensating vector potential exhibits
a singularity. from the rst sight the singularity of the eld that is a pure gauge is of
no importance. however in presence of a pseudoparticle the singularity comes to life and
contributes to the chern-simons number.

we begin from a general description of the 4-dimensional spherical coordinates and
then focus on the pseudoparticles. finally we present the calculation of the chern-simons
number.

5.1

4-dimensional spherical coordinates.

spherical coordinates make a natural choice for problems involving single euclidean pseu-
doparticle. the set of spherical coordinates includes radius and three angles: q =
(r, , , ). the polar axis is aligned with x1 and

x1 = r cos ;

x2 = r sin  sin  cos ;

x3 = r sin  sin  sin ;

x4 = r sin  cos .

(56)

the metric tensor and the vierbein are:

g = diag(1, r2 sin2 , r2 sin2  sin2 , r2);

ea
 = diag(1, r sin , r sin  sin , r) .

the compensating gauge potentials a+ and a depend on the particular choice of
 -matrices. let us remind that the antisymmetrized products +
ab must be of
correct duality so that the equations (36) and (38) were equivalent. for example, if x,
y, z stand for standard pauli matrices we can take:

ab and 

a = (i, z, y, x);

 
a = (i, z, y, x).

(60)

convolutions of the  -matrices (60) with the spin connection, (28), result into the com-
pensating gauge elds:

instantons in 4-spherical coordinates.

we shall consider instantons in singular and regular gauges with their centers at the origin.
the analysis reveals an amusing coincidence. remember that instanton gauge potentials
in these two cases involve dierent thooft symbols +
ab. hence according to our
prescription the compensating vector potentials are a+ and a respectively. it turns out
that if the  -matrices are taken in the form (60) then equation (40) for the singular gauge
and that (41) for the regular one give the same result. let us take reg and sing (5) in
the form:

ab and 

reg(r) = r2 + 2;

and

sing(r) = 1 + 2/r2.

(63)

substituting those into the equations (40, 41) with the compensating potentials given by
(61) we obtain:

the eld strength is given by the expression (53). the comparison of the latter with
(55) proves that as a rule regular and singular gauges are dierent. however in present
case the matrices n = i and the transform is trivial. the degeneracy is specic to
our choice of coordinates. note that we took q1 = r and associated with it 1 = i.
according to (55) these are necessary and sucient conditions of the coincidence of the
two gauges in curvilinear coordinates. hence this coincidence is stable with respect to
reparametrizations of the angles , ,  and  -matrices as long as r and 1 stay intact.

5.3 singularity and the chern-simons number.

it is well known that the topological charge density, (43), may be represented as a total
divergence:

 tr f  f

= k  = 



162 tr (cid:18) a f +

2i
3

a a a(cid:19) .

(66)

according to the gauss theorem the space integral of the lhs may be reduced to the
surface integral of k  over the boundary. however the current k  is not gauge invariant.
thus the distribution of k  over the boundary depends on gauge even though the topo-

logical charge q = h k  ds does not. a text book example is an instanton in the a4 = 0
gauge. here the two nonzero contributions to q come from the hyperplanes x4 = ,
(i, j, k = 1, 2, 3):

q( a4 = 0) = i k  ds =  z d3~x

(67)

the integral q0(x4) = r d3~x k 4(x4) over a 3-dimensional manifold is called the chern-

simons number.
topological charge may be interpreted as the change of the chern-simons number.

in the example above q0() =  1

2 leading to q = 1. thus the

let us try to carry out the same procedure for the gauge eld (64) in spherical coor-
dinates. at the rst sight there is a striking similarity with the a4 = 0 case. according
to (65) now ar = 0 and the instanton interpolates between a+ at r = 0 and a at
r = . it would be nice to take the radius (or rather  ln r/) for the 4-th coordinate
k r(r) d d d with the sphere s3
and to associate the chern-simons number q(r) = hs 3
r
of the radius r. the analogy would be complete provided that one had the contributions
q() = 1
2 from the innite sphere and q(0) =  1
2 from the innitesimal sphere at the
origin3. however the explicit calculation proves that this is not the case because the
singular line  = 0 carries the chern-simons number as well.

the topological charge in 4-spherical coordinates is given by the integral over a half

the rst addend in the rhs is q()  q(0) and the second comes from the integration
along the hyperstrips  = 0, . each of the four addends contributes 1
4 to the nal
value q = 1. we see that the singularity of the compensating gauge eld is not absolutely
harmless. the reason for its coming to being was that k  is not a gauge invariant.

it is easy to see that k  = r tr a fr/82. multiplication of the singular gauge
potential a by the instanton eld fr results into the singularity of k . thus the
singularity of the seemingly unobservable gauge eld a leads to nonzero consequences in
presence of the physical eld ai. in general singular gauge transformations may generate
singularities of gauge variant quantities. obviously this is specic neither to the instanton
nor to the current choice of the o(4)-spherical coordinates.

3in regular gauge, (5a), the chern-simons number is concentrated at innity q = qr() = 1, in

contrast to the singular one, (5b), where q = qs(0) = 1.

6 cylindrical coordinates

let us describe two other coordinate systems that are relevant to physics. we shall start
from 2 + 2 cylindrical coordinates, i. e. the geometry of the thick euclidean qcd-string
or vortex. then we shall consider 3 + 1 cylindrical coordinates which are characteristic
for the bag model or a glueball.

6.1

2+2 cylindrical coordinates.

these coordinates may be appropriate for objects with axial symmetry, such as strings,
vortices or quark-antiquark pairs. we parametrize the x1x2-plane by polar coordinates
q1 = r and q2 =  and leave q3, 4 = x3, 4:

x1 = r cos ;

x2 = r sin ;

x3 = z;

x4 = t.

the metric tensor and the vierbein are respectively:

g = diag (1, r2, 1, 1)

and

ea
 = diag (1, r, 1, 1).

only three of the levi-civita symbols, (15), are not zero:

r
 = r

and


r = 

r = r1.

(71)

(72)

(73)

the direct calculation (see equation (19)) proves that the spin connection has only one
nonzero component. namely:

r = 


0 1 0 0
0 0
1
0 0

rr = rz = rt = 0.

convolutions of the  -matrices (60) with the spin connection r, (28), give the compen-
sating elds that are singular at r = 0:

a
 = 

z

r = a

z = a

t = 0.

responding to the left and right rotations).

3+1 cylindrical coordinates.

this geometry is characteristic for objects that are spherically symmetrical in 3-dimen-
sions. in addition to the famous mit-bag and the glueball one may list the monopole
and the caloron that is a periodic instanton chain along the 4th axis. it takes the place

14

of the instanton in thermal problems, [9]. now we parametrize the spatial sector, i. e.
x1, x2, x3 by spherical coordinates q1 = r, q2 =  and q3 =  leaving q4 = x4.

x1 = r sin  cos ;

x2 = r sin  sin ;

x3 = r cos ;

x4 = t.

(77)

the metric tensor and the vierbein are well known:

g = diag(1, r2, r2 sin2 , 1);

ea
 = diag(1, r, r sin , 1).

(78)

since the transformation (77) aects only spatial sector the t-components, t = 0, and

conclusion

our purpose was to analyze exact multiinstanton solutions in non-cartesian coordinates.
we showed that thoofts 5n-parametric ansatz can be economically generalized to curvi-
linear coordinates. the -symbols with coordinate indices are replaced by the ab-
symbols with the vierbein ones. the price for ab being constant is the appearance of
the compensating gauge eld. the origin of the latter is the coordinate dependent gauge
transformation. thus the proposed solution is a gauge rotated version of the original
thoofts ansatz.

the compensating gauge potential may be obtained in a straightforward manner. the

calculation proceeds in three steps.

1. starting from the metrics g one may nd the levi-civita connections 

, (15).

15

2. covariant dierentiation of the vierbein e

a leads to the spin connection ra

 , (19).

3. finally the convolution of the spin connection with  -matrices gives the compen-

sating gauge potential, (28).

the rst two points are the standard calculation of the spin connection. the last one
is nothing but projecting the selfdual (or antiselfdual) component of the antisymmetric
tensor rab

 onto the su(2) gauge group.

the gauge potential of a pseudoparticle is a sum of the instanton part that is similar to
the thoofts formula and the compensating eld, (40, 41). having constant ab, (25), and
covariantly constant -symbols, (26), notably simplies calculations and is worth the
appearance of the additive compensating background. singularities of the compensating
connection do not spoil physical quantities.

where g = |det||g||| and  is the ordinary -symbol (1234 = 1). the sign of the
