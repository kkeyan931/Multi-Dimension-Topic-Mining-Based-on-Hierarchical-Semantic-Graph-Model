we re-examine quantum electrodynamics (qed) with massless electron as a nite quantum
eld theory as advocated by gell-mann-low, baker-johson, adler, jackiw and others. we analyze
the dyson-schwinger equation satised by the massless electron in nite qed and conclude that
the theory admits no non-trivial eigenvalue for the ne structure constant.

1 introduction

subsequent to the work of gell-mann and low [1] in their classic 1954 paper, the possibility that
spin- 1
2 quantum electrodynamics (qed) may be a nite quantum eld theory has been investigated
by johnson, baker and wiley [2] and by adler [3]. the basic premise of such a nite eld theory
is that the renormalization constants of qed, to wit, the electron bare mass m0, the electron wave
function renormalization constant z2 and the photon wavefunction renormalization constant z3
tend to nite limits as the cut-o  used in the calculations of the theory tends to innity. it has
been shown by johnson et al that the renormalization constant z2, a gauge variant quantity, can
be rendered nite by an appropriate choice of gauge, while the gauge invariant quantity m0 obeys
the scaling law

m0() = const.   2

where 0 is the bare ne-structure constant in qed, realized as an eigenvalue of the gell-mann-
low equation, (x) = 0 at x0 = 0. the bare mass m0 thus vanishes as   , provided  > 0.
this implies that the physical mass m arises solely from its interaction. with m0 = 0, as   ,
 = 5 is formally conserved, except for the bell-jackiw-adler [4]
the axial-vector current j 5
anomaly: j 5
it was shown by baker and johnson [5] in 1971 that although
the bare mass tends to zero in the limit of innite cut-o, the matrix elements of j 5 diverge in
just such a fashion as to render the matrix elements of j 5
 nonvanishing and nite. in this case
therefore the chiral symmetry is explicitly broken in spite of the vanishing bare mass. hence there
is no nambu-goldstone boson and such a zero mass state is not observed in nature either.

 = 2im0j 5 = 0.

to demonstrate that one can construct a nite theory of qed that will allow non-trivial eigen-
values of the gell-mann-low equation has remained somewhat of an outstanding problem. in our
earlier work on the subject [6], we had concluded that such a self-consistent nite theory does not
exist, reinforcing the 1979 conjecture of baker and johnson [7, 8]. on the other hand there have
been other investigations which conjecture that such a theory is feasible, especially the existence
of a strong coupling phase of qed [9, 10, 11]. we thought it worthwhile to re-examine the ques-
tion of non-trivial solutions of the gell-mann-low function in the nite qed theory, and embark
on another careful investigation of the standard nite qed on the basis of the dyson-schwinger
equation.

in this investigation we shall begin with a solution to the ward-takahashi (wt) identity satised
by the vector vertex function in qed and develop the dyson-schwinger equation satised by the

1

electron propagator by employing the gauge technique. this will be presented in sec.2. we shall
circumvent the problems introduced by the bell-jackiw-adler anomaly by not dealing with the axial-
vector current. we shall be working in the landau gauge throughout. the solution to the wt
identity for the vector vertex function in qed is arbitrary upto the existence of an undetermined
transverse part, as is well-known. we shall not neglect such a transverse part and we shall see
that it plays a crucial role in our investigation. in sec.3, we shall present a complete and detailed
analysis of the dyson-schwinger equation for the electron inverse propagator which will lead to
an examination of the eigenvalue problem in qed. the last section, sec.4 will be devoted to the
conclusion that there is no non-trivial solution to the eigenvalue in nite qed followed by some
important remarks.

2 dyson-schwinger equation at the qed xed point

to investigate the dyson-schwinger equation of qed at the gell-mann-low xed point, we begin
with the renormalized electron propagator whose general invariant form

s 1(p) = /p a(p2) + (p2),

(2)

follows from lorentz invariance and parity invariance (pt invariance will suce [12] ). in the nite
qed theory, we set (p2)  0, for any p and chiral symmetry remains an exact symmetry. the
proper renormalized vertex function in qed satises the ward-takahashi identity

(p  p)(p, p) = s 1(p)  s 1(p).

(3)

we would like to refer the reader to our earlier work [6] where we have reviewed the well-known
consequences of the gell-mann-low eigenvalue equation (x) = 0, which may or may not have a
non-trivial zero at x0 = 0 at the position of the bare ne structure constant of qed, 0 = z 1
3 .
the important premise of the nite theory of qed is that the position of the zero, x = x0 can
be determined by working with qed with zero physical mass [2]. this is predicated upon the
application of weinbergs theorem [13], which ensures that terms vanishing asymptotically in each
order of perturbation theory in the massive case do not sum to dominate over the asymptotic parts.

it can be easily shown that at the gell-mann-low xed point with m = 0 in nite qed, the

full, exact, remormalized electron propagator has the simple scaling form [14]

2!
s 1(p) = /pa(p2) = /p  p2

2

(4)

where () is the anomalous dimension of the electron in the massless theory given in the landau
gauge by

 = 




ln z2 = o(2) +    .

(5)

and  is the subtraction point. this can be established as follows. if we begin with the callan-
symanzik renormalization group equation [15], specialize to the landau gauge and set m = 0
(massless electron) and () = 0 at the xed point, then we have the equation satised by the
two-point function which is essentially the same as the inverse electron propagator

 




+ 2! (2)(p, , 0, , 0) = 0.

the solution for the two-point function can be expressed as

2!
a(p2) =   p2

.

(6)

(7)

this is customarily expressed in terms of the euclidean momenta, as a function of (p2), which is
how we shall employ it later in this investigation.

this can be conrmed by examining the trace anomaly in qed [16]. at a xed point, () = 0,
when we set the physical electron mass equal to zero, we have for the divergence of the scale current:

d =

()
2

ff  + [1 + () ]m  = 0

(8)

and hence scale invariance becomes exact. we further assume that scale invariance is not sponta-
neously broken, qd|0 >= 0, where

qd = z d3xd0(x, t),

(9)

(i.e., no dilatons are present in qed). therefore eq.(4) follows.

we now consider the dyson-schwinger equation satised by the inverse of the full, exact, renor-

malized electron propagator in m = 0 qed:

s 1(p) = z2/p  iz2e2(2)4z d4k ds(k)(p, k).

(10)

3

it is well-known that in a theory of m = 0, spin- 1
2 qed, the full, exact, renormalized photon
propagator is exactly given by the free photon propagtor, as established by eguchi [17] and thus
we have the form for the photon propagator in the landau gauge:

d(q) =   qq

q2  g! 1

q2

(11)

where q = p  k. the solution to the ward-takahashi identity satised by the renormalized,
proper vector vertex function in qed can be determined in the standard manner by the gauge
technique [18] to yield

 = 

l + 
t ,

(12)

where the longitudinal part of the vertex function admits the general, kinematical singularity-free
solution [ 19, 20] given by



l(p, k) =

(a + a) +

  
k2  p2 ( /p + /k)
2  a  a
k2  p2!h 2/p /k + (p2 + k2) i ,

and the transverse piece obeys the condition

(p  p)

t (p, p) = 0

(13)

(14)

and consequently undetermined by the ward-takahashi identity. here we have employed the no-
tation a = a(k2) etc. the transverse piece may be expressed by a kinematical-singularity free
decomposition in terms of invariant functions but we nd it is not necessary to do so at this point.
however it must be stressed that we shall retain it throughout our calculation. we shall see that,
undetermined and arbitrary as it is, the transverse piece of the vertex has a signicant bearing on
our conclusions. in massless nite qed, when the chiral symmetry is exact, the above solution for
the vertex function reduces to

(p, k) =

k2  p2![ 2/p /k + (p2 + k2) ] +

matrices. after a tedious computation, we arrive at the following equation:

we observe that this is a non-linear integral equation satised by the function a(p2) and it is
the exact consequence of the dyson-schwinger equation for the electron propagator in nite qed
at the gell-mann-low xed point since we have not introduced any approximations and we have
not discarded the transverse piece.

to proceed further, we need to evaluate the various angular integrals appearing in the above
equation. for this purpose, let us rst transform to euclidean momenta by the following transfor-
mations:

d4k  id4k = iz k3dkd;

p2  p2;

k2  k2;

p  k  p  k.

(18)

identifying the various angular integrals which occur as i1, i2,   which are dened in appendix a,
we obtain

(19)

it is understood that all momenta are euclidean, dened by pe = p2, ke = k2 in what

follows. henceforward we shall drop the subscript e for euclidean momenta in order to avoid

5

arrive at the following result

where 2
t (p2, k2) arises from the angular integral of the transvserse vertex part, and  = p</p>
and p< = min{p, k}, p> = max{p, k} (see appendix a ). this equation contains the essential
ingredients of nite qed, with no approximations nor additional assumptions. now in order to
ascertain whether the dyson-schwinger equations of nite theoy of qed, as we have developed thus
far, admit of a solution to the gell-mann-low eigenvalue equation, we proceed as follows. we may
check the self-consistency of the theory constructed in this manner, of massless qed at the xed
point by making the replacement

a(p2) =   p2

(21)

in accordance with eq.(4) where  = () is the qed anomalous dimension in the m = 0 theory.
after some algebra, we thus obtain

qed with massless electron at a xed point and draw conclusions.

we note that either  6= 0 or  = 0. let us rst consider the case  6= 0. since  is a nite [14]
function of , the left hand side of eq.(28) is nite. on the other hand the right hand side is unity
since, according to eq.(26), z 1
is innite for arbitrary non-zero
values of . eq.(28) cannot be satised unless  = 0. we are therefore forced to conclude [23] that
 = 0 and thus  = 0 is the only solution . incidentally, one can show explicitly that the divergent
terms of the longitudinal part in eq.(26) do not cancel except when  = 0. (see appendix b for
details). with the choice  = 0, it then follows from eq.(26) that z 1

2 diverges, which means that z 1

is nite and

(30)

a constant, independent of s which amounts to an articial and contrived constraint on the arbitrary
and unknown transverse vertex part. we therefore conclude that the ne structure constant has
only the trivial eigenvalue.

returning to our main result, we see that  = 0 is based on the non-pertubative method
stemming from the dyson-schwinger equations, and is thus valid to all orders in  in the landau
gauge. it therefore follows that for weak coupling ( << 1),  must vanish identically since  in the
landau gauge is of order 2. next we may raise the question of what happens in strong coupling
qed. now we appeal to the gauge independence of the result. since () is gauge independent
(since z3 is gauge independent) but () is gauge dependent (since z2 is gauge-dependent), the
vanishing of () is valid in all gauges, but if  = 0 in one gauge, it need not be so in other
gauges. it then follows that the only gauge independent solution which is a simultaneous zero of
both () = 0 and () = 0 is  = 0 which is the trivial solution. we cannot invoke the federbush-
johnson theorem [24] which only applies to the gauge independent sector [25] in qed. since the
gauge technique employed in this investigation is non-perturbative, we reiterate that our conclusion
is valid for arbitrarily strong coupling [9, 10, 11].

we may recall that adler et al [8] and baker-johnson [7] had argued from the triangle anomaly
[26, 27] that the gell-mann-low function cannot have a zero at all.
it is interesting that our
present investigation establishes the absence of a non-trivial zero of the gell-mann-low function
by an entirely dierent approach [28], in which the existence of the non-vanishing transverse vertex
part plays a crucial role.

we have carried out our investigation in the landau gauge. the theory of qed is gauge
invariant in content and we believe that our conclusions should prevail in any gauge. the form of
the solution a(p2) = (p2/2) remains valid in all gauges in the minimal subtraction scheme [29]
at () = 0. it would be interesting and worthwhile, however, to demonstrate the manifest gauge
invariance of the theory. this complicated extension is under investigation and will be reported in
a future communication.

appendix a: angular integrals

the computation of the right hand side of eq.(19) requires the evaluation of several angular
integrals. a few but not all of these integrals are contained in [21]. we employ an expansion in
terms of the gegenbauer functions,

|p  k|2 =



xn=0

p2

nc 1

n(x); x = cos ;  =

p<
p>

,

where p> = max{p, k}, p< = min{p, k}. the evaluation of the angular integrals is facilitated by
employing the standard properties of the gegenbauer functions [30], including in particular, the
following:

appendix b: analysis of the hypergeometric functions

here we shall analyze the behavior of the hypergeometric functions appearing in eq.(26). for
this purpose we focus our attention on the coecient of (e2/322) which is manifestly divergent on
the right hand side of the equation. this may be expressed in terms of the gamma functions as
follows:
