abstract

we consider four dimensional supersymmetric gauge eld theories from brane con-
gurations with the matter content given by semi-innite d4 branes ending on both
sides of ns branes. in m theory conguration, we discuss the splitting of the m5 brane
into innite cylindrical m5 branes (which decouple) and transversal m5 brane. the
splitting condition appears naturally from the consistency of the dierent projections of
the seiberg-witten curve.

1 introduction

one of the main developments in the recent years is clarication of the idea that gauge
theory and gravity are complementary descriptions of a single theory. congurations in
string/m theory have been very useful tools to study supersymmetric gauge eld theories
in dierent dimensions and with dierent amounts of unbroken supersymmetry. (see [1]
for a detailed review and a complete set of references up to february 1998. for more
recent works, see [2, 3, 24, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18]).

the usual construction of a four dimensional eld theory contains d4 branes with
one nite space direction, two ns branes (parallel for n = 2 supersymmetry or non -
parallel for n = 1 supersymmetry) and possible d6 branes. the gauge gluons are given
by strings between d4 branes. if there are n d4 branes, the gauge group is su(n) (
so(n) or sp(n) in the presence of an orientifold o4 or o6 plane). the matter content
can be given by either strings between d4 branes and d6 branes or strings between
d4 branes and semi-innite d4 branes ending on the ns branes [19]. to describe the
higgs moduli space one can use both approaches. for massive matter the discussion was
initiated in [20] with semi-innite d4 branes ending on one of the ns branes, and for
massless matter the problem was solved in [21].

in this paper we will discuss a brane conguration with semi-innite d4 branes ending
on both ns branes (similar congurations are considered in [22, 23]). the seiberg-witten
curve is derived, and we observe that it can be decomposed into reducible curves and this
will determine a split of the m5 brane obtained after we raise the brane conguration
to m theory.

in section 2 we consider the case of the group su(n) and we explain in detail the
m5 brane splitting. in section 3 we do the same thing for the case of orientifolds (when
the gauge group is so(n) or sp(n)).

2 su (nc) gauge theories and m5 branes splitting

consider a brane conguration for su(nc) gauge group with nf hypermultiplets in the
fundamental representation. in the type iia theory on a at space-time with time x0 and
space coordinates x1, . . . , x9, the brane conguration consists of two ns5 branes with
worldvolume coordinates x0, x1, x2, x3, x4, x5, nc d4 branes suspended between them in
the x6-direction, nr semi-innite d4 branes on the right of the right ns brane (which
we call the right semi-innite d4 branes), and nl semi-innite d4 branes on the left of

1

the left ns brane (which we call the left semi-innite d4 branes). this conguration
preserves n = 2 supersymmetry in four dimensions. in the models described before in
the literature (see [19, 20]), for simplicity, the semi-innite d4 branes end on only one
of the ns branes.

we are interested in the m theory interpretation of these brane congurations. as

usual, we introduce the complex variables:

v = x4 + ix5, w = x8 + ix9, y = exp((x6 + ix10)/r)

(1)

where x10 is the eleventh coordinate of m theory which is compactied on a circle of
radius r. now we rotate the right ns5 brane towards w direction. the new location of
the right ns5 brane becomes u := w  v = 0 and the left ns5 brane is still located at
w = 0. moreover we assume that mr of the right semi-innite d4 branes are massless
(in the sense that they are located at w = 0 ) and ml of the left semi-innite d4 branes
are massless (in the sense that they are located at u = 0). in order to be able to rotate
the ns5 brane, the m-theory seiberg-witten curve must be rational. since u and w
are two rational functions on this rational curve, they are related by a linear fractional
transformation. thus, after suitable constant shifts, we have

where  is a constant. now we project this curve to (y, u)-space to obtain:

uw = 

where

(u  ui)y  p (u) = 0,

p (u) = unc + p1unc1 +    + pnc

(2)

(3)

(4)

is some polynomial of degree nc because there are nc nite d4 branes between the two
ns branes and the the number of nite d4 branes gives the degree of p .

similarly if we project the curve to (y, w)-space, we get

where

q(w)y  awmr

nrmr

yi=1

(w  wi) = 0

q(w) = wnc + q1wnc1 +    + qnc,

and a is a normalization constant.

for all u  c.

the general solutions for p and q are of the form

p (u) = unc+mlnr p (u)
q(w) = wnc+mrnlq(u).

assuming nc > nr and nc > nl. the possible solutions for p  and q are

p (u) =

these equations suggest that the seiberg-witten curve in the (u, w, y)-space may be
decomposed into irreducible curves. in fact, this is possible when ml = mr and m =
i=1(u  ui) = 0 in (u, y)-space

ml + mr. in this case, we can see that the curve umlqm
and the curve wmr qj6=i(w  wj) = 0 in (w, y) are the images of a curve which lies on a

threefold uw = . they describe parts of the original m5 brane without the ns branes.
this means that the ns branes plus a part of the d4 branes turn into an m5 brane as
usual (which we call a transversal m5 brane) and the d4 branes which are lined on the
opposite sides of the ns branes turn into m5 branes that go through the transversal
m5 brane (which we call a cylindrical m5 brane). so the m5 brane is decomposed into

3

a cylindrical m5 brane located at u = w = 0, m cylindrical m5 branes located at
u = ui, w = wi and the transversal m5 brane given by the last terms in (14) and (15).
this is a phenomenon described in [22] in the discussion of the conifold compactication.
a very similar discussion appears in [23] where semi-innite d4 branes ending on both
sides of ns branes are also considered. in their paper there is another type of splitting
i.e. the m5 brane splits into a at one (without d4 branes ending on it) and a non-trivial
one. in eld theory this is obtained at the root of the baryonic higgs branch.

the third part, i.e. the transverse m5 brane, is a brane conguration for su(nc 
3ml) with (nl  ml  m) avors on the left and (nr  mr  m) avors on the right. it
obvious that when there is no massless avor (i. e. ml = mr = 0), the rst two curves
do not exist and, thus there is no factorization.

3 orientifold o6 plane, so (sp) groups and m5

brane splitting

 so(2nc) case

this part will be a generalization of the case considered in [24] where we have con-
sidered the case of fundamental avor given by semi-innite d4 branes and we have
considered only the case when no avor was massless. here we go one step further and
we consider both massive and massless avor. the discussion is the same as in the su
case.

to obtain the so group, we are going to introduce and orientifold o6 plane described

by:

xy = 4nc42nf v4.

(1)

let us rotate the left ns5 brane toward w and this determines a rotation of right
brane in the mirror direction (towards w) thus the left ns5 brane is located at w+ = 0
and the right ns5 brane is located at w = 0 where

w = w  v.

(2)

let  be the corresponding m-theory seiberg-witten curve. on , the function w+ will
go to innity only at one point and w+ has only a single pole there, since there is only
one ns5 brane i.e. the right ns5 brane. thus we can identify  with the punctured
complex w+-plane possibly after resolving the singularity at x = y = v = 0. similarly,
we can argue that w has a single pole on . since these two functions are rational on

4

a rational curve, they are related by a linear fractional transformation. after suitable
constant shifts, the functions w on  are related by

where  is a constant. now we project this curve to (y, w+)-space. then we obtain

this is nothing but a brane conguration for so(2nc  m) theory with nf  mf 
m avors. the gauge group so(2nc) with nf avors is broken to the gauge group
so(2nc  m) with nf  mf  m avors which agrees with qcd. in brane geometry,
the m semi-innite d4 branes are matched together with nite d4 branes to move in
w+ = 0 complex plane and in its mirror complex plane. the parts of (14) and (15)
that decouple are again interpreted as innite cylindrical m5 branes that go through the
transverse m5 brane. for the case m = 0 we obtain the result of [24], so our results are
consistent.

the terms which are factored out before arriving to the formulas (14) and (15)

represent the cylindrical m5 branes which pass through the transversal m5 brane.

the extension to so(2nc + 1) is trivial. in the odd case the equations (4) and (6)

become:

where

nf

(w+  mi)y  p (w+) = 0

q(w)y  a

(w + mi) = 0

if 2nc  nf . when m = 0, we have a special solution

q(w) = w

this agrees with [24] and, thus shows the consistency of our results.

(24)

the discussion for m 6= 0 goes the same as in the so(2nc) case and one obtains the

innite cylindrical d4 branes which go through the transverse m5 brane.

the situation is similar to so case. now the o6 plane is described by:

if we map this curve to the old surface, then the last equation becomes:

which is the same as (5.27) of [25] after rescaling of variables.

the discussion for m 6= 0 is the same as before.

4 conclusion

in this paper we have considered eld theories obtained on the worldvolume of d4
branes suspended between two ns branes. the matter content is given by semi-innite
d4 branes ending on both ns branes (as opposed to the previously considered case when
they end only on one ns brane [19, 20]). the seiberg - witten curve can be projected to
(y, u) and (y, w) spaces and the requirement that both projections hold simultaneously
suggests that the seiberg-witten curve may be decomposed into irreducible curves.
this implies that in m theory, the m5 brane is split into reducible curves, one being
the transversal m5 brane and the rest being innite cylindrical m5 branes. we have
discussed the case with or without an orientifold o6 plane.
