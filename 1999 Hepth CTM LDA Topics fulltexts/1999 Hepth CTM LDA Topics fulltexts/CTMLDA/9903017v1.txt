abstract

we consider constructing a canonical quantum theory of the light-cone gauge
(a=0) schwinger model in the light-cone representation. quantization conditions
are obtained by requiring that translational generators p+ and p give rise to heisen-
berg equations which, in a physical subspace, are consistant with the eld equations.

a consistent operator solution with residual gauge degrees of freedom is obtained by
solving initial value problems on the light-cones. the construction allows a parton

picture although we have a physical vacuum with nontrivial degeneracies in the theory.

(1.11)

where:

[(k1), (q1)] = k0(k1  q1)

(1.12)

the eld,   the eld associated with the physical schwinger particles  is a massive
psuedoscalar eld of mass m (= e ). the spurions are given in terms of these modes as:

(1.14)

to be invariant under the large gauge transformations the vacuum must be chosen to be a
theta-state, formed as:

|()i 



xn=

eim |(m)i

;

|(m)i = (+)m|0i.

(1.15)

the physical subspace is formed by applying all polynomials in  to |()i.

further details, and proof that the construction is an operator solution can be found

in the reference. here we wish to point out that while the above solution is representation
independent, it is straightforward to formulate the problem as an initial value problem at t =
0, and thus nd a solution in the equal-time representation. gauge invariant point splitting

(in a space-like direction) provides the necessary regulation for the operator products. if
we contemplate the initial value problem on the characteristic surfaces, x+ = 0 and x =
0, things are not so straightforward. the problem is that the fermi products cannot be
regulated by splitting in a light-like direction. the  eld is the sum of a function of x+
and a function of x, so the operator products are not regulated by splitting in either
light-like direction. also, the  eld suers an apparent, but spurious, infrared singularity
due to the fact that its massive character is not manifest at light-like separations. note

that these problems only have to do with the formulation of the theory as an initial value
problem on the characteristics; the light-cone representation perfectly well exists  that is,

modes of the elds along the characteristics provide all the operators necessary to generate
the entire representation space. we do need modes along both characteristics but all the

physical operators except those necessary to dene the vacuum can be generated using modes

3

along x+ = 0. to generate the vacuum we need both spurions and thus modes from both
characteristics. we shall return to the problem of formulating an initial value problem on

the characteristic surfaces below, but rst we wish to consider the question of light-cone
gauge.

2. light-cone gauge

we may attempt to reach the light-cone gauge by performing a nonlocal gauge transfor-

mation on the landau gauge solution. if we use the gauge function:

 = m1( + )

(2.1)

we nd that a+ = 0. the resulting construction almost works but it is not quite right.
one problem is that the x-dependent parts of the  and  elds are not natural degrees
of freedom in light-cone gauge. that is, standard quantization methods, whether in the
equal-time representation or in the light-cone representation do not include those degrees of

freedom in the representation space. those degrees of freedom decouple, at least formally,
and we shall simply remove them from the solution. the other problem is that we have

performed the gauge transformation with the klaiber-regulated  eld but have left the
spurions, which contain the low frequency parts of that eld, unchanged. the eect is that
the klaiber regulator, , does not disappear from physical matrix elements and the solution

is no longer translationally invariant even in the physical subspace. to cure that problem
we must modify the spurions in addition to making the gauge transformation specied by

. the correct solution in light-cone gauge is then given by (we remove the tilde from the
 eld since we keep only the x+ dependent part):

+ = z+e

again, the vacuum must be chosen to be of the form:

|()i 



xn=

eim |(m)i

;

|(m)i = (+)m|0i.

(2.9)

(2.10)

(2.11)

(2.12)

(2.13)

(2.14)

now we see that the eld, , is isomorphic to the left-moving component of a free, massless
fermi eld and it has no dependence on the ghost eld even through the spurion; both of
these properties are to be expected in light-cone gauge3). even with the modications of the
spurions the physics contained in the light-cone gauge solution is the same as that in the

landau gauge solution. in particular, we nd the anomaly:

and the chiral condensate:

j 5

 =

e
2

 f 

h()|  |()i = 

m
2

e cos 

(2.15)

(2.16)

we believe that this construction is the correct light-cone gauge solution to the continuum

schwinger model but it does have some unexpected properties which we should discuss. most
striking is that the vacuum expectation of the spurion, +, not only does not vanish, as it
does in the landau gauge solution, but diverges. that fact may cause one to wonder in
what sense the equations of motion are satised in the physical subspace. the point is that
the + eld is not a physical operator ( since it carries a charge) and the only way the
spurions enter physical operators is in the chargeless combinations, + and 
+. the

chargeless combinations of spurions simply add zero norm states to the state acted upon
and, in particular, act as c-numbers in the physical subspace. with that in mind, it is easy
to use the arguments in ref. 1 to show that the equations of motion are satised in the

following sense: take any physical operator and use the lagrange equations of motion to
derive an equation of motion for the physical operator. then the derived equation of motion

will be satised in the physical subspace. that is the common situation in qcd.

5

as with the landau gauge solution, the light-cone gauge solution is straightforward to
quantized on t = 0. indeed, except for the spurions, it is very similar to the periodic solution
found by bassetto, nardelli and vianello.4) but it is not so straightforward to quantize the
continuum solution on x+ = 0 due to the fact that the current,  ++ is not regulated by
splitting in the x direction. we notice that the problem was already present in the landau
gauge solution and is due to the initial value surface, not the gauge choice.

3. quantization in the light-cone representation

the schwinger model is dened by the lagrangian:

l = 

1
4

ff   (a0  a1) + i    e   a = 2f+f+
a  2e ++a+

 + 2i +++  2e 


 2a + 2i 


where:

a =

1
2

(a0a1), f+ = +a  a+.

the eld equations and the gauge xing condition are:

2f+ = e ++ = j,
2+f+   = e 
 = j+,


i = ea,
i++ = e+a+,

a = 0.

(3.1)

(3.2)

(3.3)
(3.4)
(3.5)
(3.6)
(3.7)

from current conservation, +j + j+ = 0, and eqs.(3.3)and (3.4), we obtain the eld
equation of :

the canonical energy-momentum tensor is given by:

 = 0.

t = i    fa + g{

1
4

ff  + (a0  a1)}

(3.8)

(3.9)

where we have used the eld equation of the fermion eld. components in light-cone coor-
dinates are given explicitly by :

t++ = i 
+  (f+, +a+)+

= i 
+ + (a+, +a+)+,

  (f+)2  (f+, a+)+

t+ = i 


6

(3.10)

= i 


 + (a+)2,

t+ = i +++  (f+)2  (f+, +a)+

= i +++  (a+)2,

t = i ++ + (f+, a)+

= i ++

(3.11)

(3.12)

(3.13)

where we have used the gauge xing condition.

from these expressions we can see some of the problems we will encounter when we
apply the canonical formulation to the schwinger model in the representation generated by

modes of the elds along either light-cone surface. when we construct a light-cone-temporal
gauge formulation,5) in which x is chosen to be the evolution parameter, we use t++ and
t+ as densities to calculate the translational generators. we see that + and  + are not
contained in the densities so that we can not treat + as a degree of freedom. if we consider
the standard light-cone gauge treatment (the light-cone-axial gauge), in which x+ is the
evolution parameter and t+ and t are the densities of the translational generators we
see that we need zero mode elds (elds which are functions only of x+). these elds will
require special treatment.

we shall show in section 4 that we can nd a light-cone-temporal gauge solution by
expressing + as a functional of a+ (it is done the other way around in the light-cone
in
gauge). the problem of the zero-mode elds is principally one of recognizing them.

fact we can nd those missing terms by dening the translational generators in the light-
cone coordinate space by requiring that they are identical to those in ordinary coordinate
space(x0, x1).6) from the divergence equation

we obtain:

 t = 0

i t d = 0.

(3.14)

(3.15)

if we perform the integral over the closed surface shown in fig.1, it is clear that the integral
over the surface t = x0 is the negative of that over the light-cone surfaces. thus we obtain

l

t0(x0, x1)dx1 = z x0+l

z l
t(x+ = x0 + l, x)dx +z x0+l

x0l

+z x0

x0l

t+(x+, x = x0)dx+

t(x+ = x0  l, x)dx.

x0

7

hence in the limit l we obtain



p = z 
+z x0

t0(x0, x1)dx1 = z 
t(x+ = , x)dx +z 
we show in section 4 that t is expressed solely in terms of a massive eld so that t
tends to 0 when x+  . in that case we have:

t(x+ = , x)dx.

t+(x+, x = x0)dx+

(3.16)





x0

p+ = z 

{i

+ + (a+, +a+)+}dx+,

(3.17)

p = z 



(a+)2dx+.

(3.18)

we see from this that in the temporal gauge formulation there are no missing degrees of
freedom. we also see that the canonical momenta of a+ and  are 2a+ and i 

tively.

x-

t

fig. 1.

similarly carrying out the contour integral shown in fig.2, we obtain:
t(x+ = x0, x)dx
t+(x+, x = )dx+.

t0(x0, x1)dx1 = z 
t+(x+, x = )dx+ +z 

p = z 
+z x0





x0



(3.19)

we show in section 4 that if we choose nonvanishing initial values, then t++ tends to them
in the limit x  . in that case we have

p+ = z 

{i +++  (a+)2}dx +z 



t++(x+, x = )dx+.

we also show that t+ vanishes in the limit x   so that we have:

(3.20)

(3.21)

p = z 



t(x+, x)dx = z

fig. 2.

now we derive quantization conditions for the canonical elds a+,   and + by re-
quiring that their commutation relations with p+ and p give rise to heisenberg equations
which are consistent with the eld equations (the argument is similar to that of 6)). in the
temporal gauge formulation p+ in (3.17) is the kinematical operator so that we obtain the
heisenberg equation:

if we require the equal-x quantization conditions:

i[p+, (x)] = +(x)

{(x+, x),  


(y+, x)}+ = (x+  y+),

{(x+, x), (y+, x)}+ = 0,

9

(3.22)

(3.23)

[a+(x+, x), (y+, x)] = 0,
[a+(x+, x), (y+, x)] = 0.

furthermore, we obtain the heisenberg equations:

i[p+, a+(x)] = +a+(x),

i[p+, +(x)] = ++(x)

if we require, in addition, the equal-x quantization conditions:

[a+(x+, x), a+(y+, x)] = 0,

[a+(x+, x), a+(y+, x)] = 
(y+, x)}+ = 0,

{+(x+, x), (y+, x)}+ = 0,

i
2

(x+  y+).

{+(x+, x),  


[a+(x+, x), +(y+, x)] = 0,

[a+(x+, x), +(y+, x)] =

e
4

(x+  y+)+(x).

(3.24)

(3.25)

(3.26)

(3.27)

(3.28)

we remark that the second commutation relation in (3.28) is unusual in the canonical for-
malism and that at this point, nothing is known about the equal-x commutation relations
between + and  +. we also remark that, although a+ obeys a eld equation of the second
order in the light-cone temporal gauge formulation , as is seen from (3.3), the commutator
[a+(x+, x), a+(y+, x)] is not zero but has the following nonvanishing value

[a+(x+, x), a+(y+, x)] = i

m2
16

(x+  y+).

(3.29)

this is because consistent operator solutions are obtained if and only if we regularize the

fermi products in a gauge invariant way. (in the schwinger model, regularizing the current
operators and the fermionic kinetic terms gauge invariantly gives rise to the chiral anomaly.)
it is shown in section 4 that (3.23) combined with gauge invariant point splitting for the
+ so that (3.29) is required to produce the heisenberg
term i 

equation

+ gives rise to  m2

4 a2

i[p+, a+(y+, x)] = +a+(x).

(3.30)

now that we have obtained the quantization conditions in the temporal gauge formula-
tion, we can make use of them to obtain the heisenberg equations which the dynamical p
in (3.18) produces. straightforward calculation gives

i[p, (x)] = 0,

i[p, a+(x)] = a+(x),

i[p, a+(x)] = 

(+)1a+(x),

m2
4

i[p, +(x)] = 

ie
2

((+)1a+(x), +(x))+.

(3.31)

10

we see from the heisenberg equation of a+ that a+ behaves like a free eld of mass
m.

in the axial gauge formulation p in (3.21) is the kinematical operator so that we obtain

the heisenberg equations:

i[p, (x)] = 0,

i[p, +(x)] = +(x)

if we specify the following equal-x+ commutation relations:

{(x+, x),  +(x+, y)}+ = 0,

{(x+, x), +(x+, y)}+ = 0,

{+(x+, x),  +(x+, y)}+ = (x  y),

{+(x+, x), +(x+, y)}+ = 0.

(3.32)

(3.33)

(3.34)

we can not obtain any other quantization conditions unless we solve eqs.(3.3) and (3.6).

4. construction of operator solutions

now that we have the algebra of the elds, we can proceed to construct the solution. we
might consider the problem as an initial value problem on x = 0 or x+ = 0, or, proceed in a
more covariant way. here, we shall consider the initial value problem on each characteristic.
first we consider the initial value problem on the surface x = 0.

4.1. light-cone temporal gauge solution

from (3.5) we see that when a=0, the rst component, , is a free eld depending

only on x+. thus we specify  as a free, massless fermion eld:

satisfying the anticommutation relations:

(x) = (x)

{(x), 


(y)}+ = (x+  y+),

{(x), (y)}+ = 0.

furthermore we make use of the fusion eld dened by:

: e


(x)(x) := m+(x)

to express  in the following equivalent bosonized form:

(x) = zexp[2i()(x)]exp[2i(+)(x)].

11

(4.1)

(4.2)

(4.3)

(4.4)

here, z is the nite normalization constant ,  is the spurion operator and () and (+)
are positive and negative frequency parts of  regularized a la klaiber (the construction
is exactly the same as in (2.5),(2.7) and (2.11)). by construction  satises the following
commutation relation:

[(x), (y)] = 

(x+  y+).

(4.5)

i
4

then, carrying out a gauge invariant point splitting procedure we nd the following well-
dened current:

j+(x) = lim
y+x+

e
2{


a+(z+, x)dz+] + h.c.}

y+

(x+)(y+)exp[iez x+
= m+(x) 
+ is regularized as follows:

a+(x).

m2
2

furthermore, the kinetic term i 


lim

y+x+{

i

(x+)+(y+)exp[iez x+
= (+)2 

y+

a+(z, x)dz] + h.c. 
m2

(a+)2.

1
2

(x+  y+)2}

so that p+ in (3.17) is given by

p+ = z 

{(+)2 

m2
4

(a+)2 + (a+, +a+)+}dx+.

now note that owing to (4.6), eq.(3.4) can be written as

(4+ + m2)a+(x) = 2{(x) + m+(x)}.

multiplying this by  leads to

(4.6)

(4.7)

(4.8)

(4.9)

(4+ + m2)a+(x) = 0

(4.10)

due to the fact that (x) and (x) depend only on x+. thus we see that a+ is a free
 in the landau gauge
eld of mass m. since a+ is gauge invariant and is equal to  m
operator solution, our present result is in agreement with the earlier results. here we set

2

a+(x) = 

.

m
2

(4.11)

where the normalization is determined by (3.29). then we notice that replacing a+ in
(4.9) by  enables us to express a+ in terms of ,  and  as

a+(x) =

2
m2{ + m+( + )}.

(4.12)

12

the commutation relation (3.29) is transcribed as that of :

[ (x+, x), (y+, x)] = 

i
4

(x+  y+)

and the commutation relations of  are obtained by rewriting (4.9) for  as

 =

1
2{m2a+ + 4+(a+)  m+}

and by making use of the commutation relations (3.26), (3.29),(4.5) and

[(x), a+(y)] = 0,

[(x), a+(y)] = 0,

which result from (3.24),(4.1) and (4.3). combining these results we get

[(x), (y)] = 0,

[(x), (y)] = 0,

[(x), (y)] = i

m
2

(x+  y+).

(4.13)

(4.14)

(4.15)

(4.16)

now we see that  is a zero norm eld and that maxwells equations are recovered in a
physical subspace formed by factoring the zero norm eld  out of the representation space.

if we rewrite  as

(x) = m+((x)  (x))

(4.17)

and take account of the third commutation relation of  in(4.16) we nd that  is a negative
norm eld depending only on x+ and satises the following commutation relations

[(x), (y)] =

i
4

(x+  y+),

[(x), (y)] = 0,

[(x), (y)] = 0.

(4.18)

as a result a+ in (4.12) may be written as

in terms of these elds p+ in (4.8) and p in (3.18) are diagonalized as follows

a+ =

2
m

+(  + ).

(4.19)

(4.20)

(4.21)

p+ = z 

{(+)2  (+)2 + (+ )2}dx+,
p = z 

( )2dx+,

m2
4



which shows that ,  and  are constituent free elds of the light-cone temporal gauge
schwinger model.

let us turn to specifying +, which satises (3.3) and (3.6). because in the temporal
gauge formulation there is no dynamical equation which allows us to determine + as an
initial value problem, we make use of the fact that using (4.19), we can write eq. (3.3) as

j = e ++ = m

.

(4.22)

13

we see from this that the  eld can be identied as a fusion eld composed of  + and
+ and that + in turn can be expressed in an equivalent bosonized form(this result will
be obtained in the axial gauge formulation). as a matter of fact a+ given in (4.19) is
identical with the electromagnetic eld given in(2.8) so that the fermion operator (2.2)
satises eq.(3.6). therefore we specify + as in(2.2) and show that it also satises eq.(3.3).
to this end we also regularize the bilinear product e ++ by the gauge-invariant point
splitting procedure. we see immediately that if we split only in the x+ direction, then the
sum  +  in the exponent behaves like a zero norm operator so that the procedure does
not work. we also see that if we split only in the x direction, then the  eld gives rise
to a divergence at high frequencies. therefore we have to split in another direction. the
following two-step limit, with  being a timelike vector, gives us the desired result:

j(x) =

e

0{ lim

+0(cid:18) +(x + )+(x)exp[iez x+

(4.23)

the axial-vector current j 5
(2.15). in addition, a conserved axial-vector current

  j , where + = + = 1

2 and  = ++ = 0, satises

j 5
c = (j  + m2a),

(4.24)

is obtained by regularizing e  5 , with  and + being  and (2.2) respectively, in the
same manner as the vector current:

j 5
c+(x) = 

e

+0(cid:18) +(x + )+(x)exp[iez x+

dza(z)] + h.c.(cid:19)}

(4.26)

it can be shown furthermore that the fermion operator (2.2) satises the anticommutation
relations in (3.34), if we dene them as y+x+ limit so as to avoid any divergences.

we end the temporal gauge construction by dening physical space v by

v = { |phys > | (+)(x)|phys >= 0 }

(4.27)

where (+)(x) denotes the positive frequency part of .

14

4.2. light-cone axial gauge solution

in the axial gauge formulation x+ is taken to be the evolution parameter so that we can
solve eq.(3.6) as an initial value problem on x+ = 0. as an initial value of + we take a free
fermi eld r(x) and dene a fusion eld  by

then, by construction  satises the commutation relation

[ (x), (y)] =

and eq.(3.3) becomes

j(0, x) = m

(x) = 22


a+(0, x)

(4.28)

(4.29)

(4.30)

where point splitting in the x direction has enabled us to utilize the fact that a = 0.
from (4.30) we obtain

a+(0, x) = 

m
2

(x).

(4.31)

as a consequence if we neglect the second unspecied term of (3.20) for the moment, then
we can express p+ solely in terms of  as

p+ = z 
= z 



{j(0, x)a+(0, x)  (a+)2}dx
( (x))2dx.
(a+)2dx =

4 z 



(4.32)

furthermore, by making use of the equivalent bosonized form of r we can expressp in
(3.21) as

p = z 



i +(0, x)+(0, x)dx = z 



)2dx.

(

(4.33)

it follows from (4.32) and (4.33) that the fusion eld  is again constituent free eld of mass
m.

the temporal evolution of +(0, x) is dened by making use of p+ in (4.32) by

+(x+, x)eip+x+

r(0, x)eip+x+

.

then by making use of the equivalent bosonized form we can write

+(x+, x) = zexp[2i ()(x)]rexp[2i (+)(x)]

where

(4.38)

here we have omitted the klein transformation factor. it is evident that + satises the
anticommutation relations (3.34).

now we notice that on the surface x+ =constant, + behaves like a free fermion eld
and that both p+ and p are diagonalized in terms of the fusion eld. thus we see that
the common hope in the light-cone quantization that the light-cone bare states are closer to
partons than the ordinary equal-time bare states is realized in its strongest possible form.
at the same time we also see that the initial value problem which we have considered also

gives rise to the well-known problem common to axial gauge quantizations: we come have
ill-dened equal-x+ commutation relations of a+ because a+ is obtained from (4.31) as

a+ = 

m
2

()1  =

2
m

+ .

(4.39)

note that the diculty results from the fact that the antiderivative ()1 is not well-dened
in any positive denite hilbert space.8) therefore we introduce the  eld as in (4.19) to
regularize (4.39) although doing so obscures the parton picture. to obtain a consistent
solution we also introduce the fermi eld (x+) as well as the fusion eld (x+) and solve
eqs.(3.4) and (3.5) in the same manner as in the temporal gauge formulation. this enables
us to identify the  eld with the fusion eld  and thus hereafter we denote  as  .
furthermore by assuming that the massive degrees of freedom of t++ contained in (4.20)
vanishes as x  , we obtain

t++(x+, x = ) = (+)2  (+)2

so that p+ in (3.20) is xed to be

p+ =

m2

4 z 



2dx +z 

{(+)2  (+)2}dx+.

(4.40)

(4.41)

in this way we can reconstruct, in the axial gauge formulation, the p+ given in (4.20) .

now that a+ possesses zero mode elds (elds independent of x), we have to take this
fact into account when we solve eq.(3.6) as the initial value problem on the surface x+ = 0.
as an alternative initial value satisfying the equal-x+ anticommutation relations we choose

+(0, x) = exp[2i(0)]r(x).

(4.42)

16

note that (4.42) has a diverging vacuum expectation value, which is inevitable as long as
we respect the equal-x+ anticommutation relations. in fact when we rewrite the exponential
function of (0) as the normal product, divergences appear at low frequencies and at high
frequencies but the divergence at high frequencies is canceled by the zero from the r,
whereas divergence at low frequencies remains.

to investigate connection between (4.42) and (2.2), we rewrite the exponential function

of (0) as follows

e2i(0) = exp[

1

2 z 



dk+
k+

]exp[2i()(0)]+exp[2i(+)(0)].

at the same time we rewrite the spurion operator r as the normal product form:

(4.43)

(4.44)

(4.45)

(4.46)

r = exp[

1

2 z

then we see that because

c(p)].

the divergence from the former is canceled by one from the latter if we require

 =

m2
4

.

in that case the normalization factor z in (4.36) is identical with the z+ in (2.4) so that
(4.42) agrees exactly with (2.2) at x+ = 0.

now we notice that the fermion operator (2.2) is obtained from the initial value (4.42)

with  = m2

4 as a result of the temporal evolution

and that the zero mode elds do not prevent us from obtaining

+(x+, x)eip+x+

+(0, x)eip+x+

j = m ,

i ++ = (

)2

(4.47)

(4.48)

and hence both p+ and p are already diagonal so that the parton picture is realized even
when there exist zero mode elds in the formulation. that is the main nding of this paper.
we end this section by pointing out that we can not change the order of integrations

and dierentiations in the evaluation of the commutation relations of a+.
in fact they
are obtained unambiguously if we rst evaluate the two-dimensional commutator [(x) +
(x), (y) + (y)] = ie(x y) and then dierentiate the ie(x y) with respect x
+ and y
+.

5. concluding remarks

in this paper we have shown that an operator solution to the light-cone gauge schwinger
model is obtained by solving the initial value problem on x = 0 to specify  and one
on x+ = 0 to specify + simultaneously. the solution turns out to be independent of any
particular representation. we have discussed the formulation and solution of the problem in

the equal-time representation and in the light-cone representation. the problem is straight-
forward to formulate at equal time, but solving it involves a nontrivial diagonalization of the

hamiltonian.

if we consider the initial value problem on x+ = 0, there are two diculties which we
must overcome: we must include the zero-mode elds; and we must regularize the fermi
products on our initial value surface. as for the rst problem, a substantial ability to nd
the necessary zero-mode elds has developed starting with the work of bassetto, soldati and
nardelli9). once the necessary elds are recognized, putting them into the solution is not
dicult. looking at the full solution we can see how the fermi products are regulated when

the covariant solution is split in a timelike direction. there are four sources of singularity:
there is a singularity due to the  eld at high frequency; if the splitting is not zero in the
x direction it gives a factor proportional to (x)1that singularity is necessary for the
point splitting procedure to work; there is a singularity due to the  eld at low frequencies;
if the splitting is not zero in the x+ direction it gives a factor proportional to (x+)1 and is
therefore not regulated by splitting in the x directionthat singularity is cancelled by a zero
from the ghost eld. there is a potential singularity due to the  eld at high frequencies;
actually, it turns out to be a zero; if the splitting is not zero in the x+ direction it gives
a factor proportional to (x+) and is the zero which cancels the low frequency singularity
from the  eld. there is a low frequency singularity from the  eldthat singularity is
absorbed into the spurion and gives rise to the infrared states, linear combinations of which

form the  states.

in dlcq the p+ = 0 singularity is regulated with periodicity conditions. in that case
the continuum answer is not recovered for physical matrix elements, even if the problem is
solved exactly at nite l and the limit l   is then taken.10) it may well be that for
many problems it is necessary to carefully regulate the theory prior to imposing periodicity

conditions. the dlcq grid would then be just a numerical device, not a regulator. such
procedures have been suggested in ref.11). we do not think the techniques necessary to

carry out that procedure are known for all cases but the knowledge is growing.
