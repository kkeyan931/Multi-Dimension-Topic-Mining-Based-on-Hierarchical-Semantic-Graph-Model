abstract

closed string dynamics in the presence of noncommutative dp-branes is investigated. in par-
ticular, we compute bulk closed string two-point scattering amplitudes; the bulk space-time
geometries encoded in the amplitudes are shown to be consistent with the recently proposed
background space-time geometries dual to noncommutative yang-mills theories. three-point
closed string absorption/emission amplitudes are obtained to show some features of noncom-
mutative dp-branes, such as modied pole structures and exponential phase factors linearly
proportional to the external closed string momentum.

1 introduction

in the framework of open strings, it is now possible to systematically study the physics on
noncommutative space-time [1]-[6]. in particular, a natural vantage point for the investigation of
(p + 1)-dimensional gauge theories on a noncommutative space is to consider the world-volume
theory of dp-branes when the constant background ns-ns two-form gauge elds parallel to the
branes are turned on. one can then study open string dynamics stuck to the branes and nd that,
in an appropriate decoupling limit, the world-volume theory corresponds to noncommutative
yang-mills theory [1]-[6].

the main theme of this paper is to understand closed string dynamics in the presence of
noncommutative dp-branes. on top of an obvious observation that any theory of open strings
should include closed strings, there are other reasons to study closed string dynamics in this con-
text. by now, there are considerable body of evidence toward the validity of the duality between
the conformal eld theory on a (p + 1)-dimensional space and the string theory/supergravity on
a (p + 2)-dimensional anti-de sitter space [7]. one natural question following the understand-
ing of noncommutative yang-mills theory is to nd an appropriate dual background space-time
geometry. recently, such dual background space-time geometries were proposed by hashimoto
and itzhaki [8], and maldacena and russo [9], following the chain of t-duality arguments [1].
these background space-time geometries can be directly probed by closed strings moving on
it. thus, the study of the closed string two-point scattering amplitudes shown in fig. 1 may
provide us with a direct string theoretic justication for the proposed background geometries.
the second issue is to understand noncommutative d-brane black holes. it has been noted that
the hawking radiation from d-brane black holes and its time-reversal process, the matter ab-
sorption into such black holes, can be understood via the microscopic d-brane description by
considering three-point amplitudes of the type shown in fig. 2 [10]. one then wonders what
will be the effect of the world-volume noncommutativity on the emission/absorption processes
from d-branes. finally, it is suggested that the noncommutative gauge theories play a crucial
role in the development of string eld theories [6, 11]. understanding subleading effects in 1/n
is important in the construction of string eld theories, and the inclusion of the closed strings
is an essential step for that purpose; one needs to evaluate correlation functions on general rie-
mann surfaces with boundaries along with marked points and handles. it will be nice to have
a simple calculational prescription to take into account of the effect of the background ns-ns

1

two-form gauge elds in such a context1. in this paper, we address the rst two issues and, in
that process, make a modest progress toward the third issue.

in section 2, after setting up our notations based on refs. [12, 13], we explain how the
noncommutativity effects are implemented by simple global rotations of the two string coor-
dinates parameterizing a two-cycle along which the ns-ns two-form gauge eld b has a
non-vanishing component whose strength determines the global rotation angle. starting from
the usual neumann boundary conditions where we identify the holomorphic sector and the anti-
holomorphic sector at the world-sheet boundary, the operator products for the general value of
b can thus be simply determined. the senses of the rotation for the holomorphic sector and
the anti-holomorphic sector are opposite to each other; therefore, the /2 rotation (large b
limit) ips the neumann boundary condition into the dirichlet boundary condition, turning dp-
branes into d(p  2)-branes. for generic values of b, both dp-branes and d(p  2)-branes
are present [14]. the correlation functions in the presence of noncommutative d-branes can be
computed by inserting these rotation matrices at appropriate steps of the calculations.

in section 3, we directly compute the tree-level closed string two-point scattering ampli-
tudes, shown in fig. 1 in the presence of noncommutative dp-branes. in the s-channel factor-
ization limit, intermediate open string states are identied and are shown to be consistent with
the picture of seiberg and witten [6]. on-shell, this amplitude does not contain (due to the
momentum conservation parallel to the branes) the exponential phase factor used to dene the
-product [6, 15].

in section 4, the same scattering problems are also investigated on the background geome-
tries of refs. [8, 9] via supergravity analysis at long distance (fig. 2). the results turn out to
be identical to those obtained in section 3 when we approach the leading t-channel pole for the
string amplitudes, justifying the background supergravity space-time geometries of refs. [8, 9].
in section 5, we compute the three-point amplitudes shown in fig. 3 to study the absorp-
tion/emission from noncommutative dp-branes. the key difference between the commutative
and the noncommutative cases is the existence of an exponential phase factor for each factor-
ization channel, which is used to dene the -product in the noncommutative case [6]. by the
momentum conservation parallel to the branes, the exponential phase depends linearly on the
external closed string momentum parallel to the branes; it vanishes for the external closed string
momentum with vanishing parallel components (see also [16]). furthermore, when compared to
the commutative case, the pole and zero structures of the amplitudes are distinctively changed.

1in the case of purely open string diagrams, a simple prescription in this regard is available in refs. [4, 6].

in section 6, we discuss the implications and possible generalizations of our calculations

presented in this paper.

2 preliminaries

our computation of correlation functions will be based on the modern covariant formulation
dened via a conformal eld theory on the open string world-sheet. our primary interest is
to understand how the existence of the background ns-ns two-form gauge eld affects the
correlation functions involving closed strings. in the context of pure open strings, this issue
was investigated in [4, 6]. a useful starting point for this purpose is to consider the open string
action

s = 

1

4 z d2(gax ax  + ibabax bx ) + fermionic part,

(2.1)

where x , g and b represent the string coordinates, the constant background metric and the
constant background ns-ns two-form eld, respectively. the background b eld has non-zero
components only along the directions parallel to the dp-branes. the components perpendicular
to the branes can be gauged away.

since the b eld vanishes along the directions perpendicular to the branes, we can simply
impose the usual dirichlet boundary conditions for the perpendicular directions. the parallel
directions, however, even if the bulk equations of motion are not affected by the constant b
eld, the neumann boundary condition changes to

gnx  + ibtx  = 0

(2.2)

on the open string end points. here n and t denote the normal derivative and the tangential
derivative to the boundary of the string world sheet, respectively.

in this paper, we will be interested in disk diagrams only. for the computational conve-
nience, we map the disk to the upper half plane, putting boundary at the real-axis on the complex
plane. also for simplicity, we set g = 

2. it is straightforward to relax this restriction.

a useful trick to handle the mode expansion under the boundary condition eq. (2.2) is the
following. let r = 2k be the rank of the background b eld. using the so(1, p) symmetry
of the brane and redening some coordinates, we can set b = 0 for 0    p  r or
2when writing down products of tensor objects, especially from section 3, the dot product with respect to g

is implied, unless otherwise noted.

0    p  r and bring the remaining r  r matrix to the block diagonal form. if we denote
the r coordinates by yi (1  i  r), the restriction of b eld to (y2i1, y2i) subspace takes the
form

bi =(cid:18) 0
bi
introduce a matrix r whose i-th 2  2 block is
ri =(cid:18) cos i
 sin i

sin i

cos i(cid:19) ,

bi

0 (cid:19) .

(2.3)

(2.4)

where i  tan1 bi, and otherwise equal to the identity matrix. in terms of the matrix r, the
boundary condition (2.2) can be rewritten as

rt zx  rzx = 0,

where we consider x  as a column vector.

let x(z) be the operator dened in terms of the mode expansion 3

x (z) =



xn=


nzn1 .

(2.5)

(2.6)

when b = 0, we dene the anti-holomorphic counterpart x(z) using the same oscillator
modes 
n in order to ensure the neumann boundary condition on x(z, z) = x(z) + x(z).
when b 6= 0, we note that the eld

x(z, z) = rx(z) + rt x(z)

satises (2.5). using the standard operator product

hx (z)x (w)i =  ln(z  w),

one can easily determine the operator products for the rotated x, x elds:

h(rx)(z)(rx)(w)i =  ln(z  w),
h(rt x)(z)(rt x)( w)i =  ln(z  w),

h(rx)(z)(rt x)i = (2g   + 2) ln(z  w),

(2.7)

(2.8)

(2.9)

(2.10)

(2.11)

where we dened, following [6], g and  as the symmetric and anti-symmetric part of
( + b)1, respectively. clearly, one can combine the above formulas to obtain the expres-
sion for the operator product of two open string vertex operators, originally derived in [13]

3from here on, we set  = 2.

the holomorphic part and the anti-holomorphic part of the string coordinates are related to

each other via

(rx(z)) = r2(cid:16)rt x(z)(cid:17)

(2.12)

at the boundary z = z. therefore, as bi  , i.e., i  /2, the neumann boundary condition
at i = 0 ips to the dirichlet boundary condition, r2
i = i. in the intermediate case, the
boundary conditions are mixed, tan i being the measure of the relative proportion of the
dirichlet boundary parts (d(p  2)-branes) to the neumann boundary parts (dp-branes).

3 scatterings from noncommutative d-branes

we now perform the calculation of the bulk two-point closed string amplitudes shown in fig. 1.
after a brief review of the same calculation without the background b eld [10], we turn on the
constant background b eld.

3.1 review: scatterings from commutative d-branes

the closed string scattering amplitude from a commutative dp-brane is given by

a = z d2z1d2z2hv1(z1, z1)v2(z2, z2)i,

corresponding to the string diagram fig. 1. the appropriate vertex operators are

v1(z1, z1) = (1d)v 

1(p1, z1)v 

1(dp1, z1) ,

5

(3.1)

(3.2)

v2(z2, z2) = (2d)v 

0 (p2, z2)v 

0 (dp2, z2) ,

v 
1(p1, z1) = e(z1)(z1)eip1x(z1) ,
v 
0 (p2, z2) = {x (z2) + ip2  (z2)(z2)}eip2x(z2) ,

where the matrix d is dened as

d

) .

the matrix d is included to account for the dirichlet boundary condition on the world-sheet
eld associated with the directions perpendicular to the brane. fixing the sl(2, ir) invariance
of the amplitude (3.1), and performing the remaining integral, one nds that

(3.8)

(3.9)

a =

(s)(t)

(1 + s + t)

(sa1  ta2),

where the two kinematic invariants are dened by

s = 2p2

1k = 2p2

2k, t = p1  p2 ,

and

2 dp2 + p1dt

+p1d1t
(s + t)tr(1d)tr(2d) .

1 2dp2 + str(1d2d)  str(1t
2 )

this string amplitude4 is consistent with the well-known dp-brane supergravity background
geometry as shown in [10]. we note that the external closed string momenta are conserved only
along the directions parallel to the branes, p1k + p2k = 0.

3.2 turning on the b eld

as we observed in section 2, the effect of the constant b eld background can be incorporated
simply by rotating the world-sheet elds by the matrix r dened there. equivalently, we can
rotate the polarization tensors and momenta in the denitions of the vertex operators

v1(z1, z1) = (rt 1drt )v 

1(rt p1, z1)v 

1(rdp1, z1) ,

(3.10)

(3.11)
4we note that in ref. [10], there is a typographical error that appears in the expression for a1. for the scattering

v2(z2, z2) = (rt 2drt )v 

0 (rt p2, z2)v 

0 (rdp2, z2) ,

processes involving b, the correct formula shown here is important for the comparison with supergravity.

6

while leaving the denitions (3.4), (3.5) as they are. a bit of algebra shows that the amplitude
is modied as

a =

(s)(t)

(1 + s + t)

(sa1  ta2),

(3.12)

where s = 2g(pk)(pk), while the denition of t is the same as the one in section 3.1. the
polarization dependent part a1 and a2 are computed to be

a1 = tr(1d+)p12p1  p12d+1p2  p12t

1 dp1  p1t

2 1d+p1 + {1  2}

p12t

+p1d+1d+2d+p2 + {1  2}
+p1d+1t
2 d+p2 + p1d+t
(s + t)tr(1d+)tr(2d+) .

1 2d+p2 + str(1d+2d+)  str(1t
2 )

to keep the notations simple, we introduced

and

d
  d + 2  2 ,

 = g   .

(3.13)

(3.14)

(3.15)

we note that s is the s-channel momentum transfer computed with respect to the open string
metric g. when we push one of the bulk closed string vertex toward the open string boundary,
we approach the s-channel factorization limit where we expect to observe intermediate open
string states. as was explained in ref. [6], these open string intermediate states feel the open
string metric g instead of , providing an explanation for the new denition of s. in the
large b limit, therefore, the kinetic energy along the directions parallel to the two-cycle along
which b is turned on becomes negligible, being suppressed by 1/(1+b2) factor (see also [16]).

3.3 massless t-channel poles

the modications due to the non-vanishing b eld in eqs. (3.13) when compared to eqs. (3.9)
become more transparent when we consider the leading t-channel poles. essentially, the be-
havior of the string amplitudes around massless t-channel poles contains informations on the
long range background elds. when expanded around massless t-channel poles, the scattering
amplitude (3.12) reduces to

a

t

a1 + o(1) 

1
t

a + o(1) .

(3.16)

7

the bulk massless string states are gravitons, b elds and the dilaton. therefore, for the two-
point scatterings, there are six possible combinations of external closed string states. among
these, we write down below ve possible combinations by explicitly plugging in the polarization
states into eqs. (3.13):

a(b, ) = 8p11p2 ,
a(b, h) = 2{tr(1)p21p2  2p212p1 + 2p212p2  2p121p1},
a(, ) = 8s,
a(, h) = 2(p  3)p12p1 + 2tr()p12p1,
a(b, b) = 2p12(d + 2)1p2 + 2p121(d + 2)p1

+2p212(d + 2)p2 + 2p121p2  str(12) .

(3.17)

the arguments of a(x, y) denote the two external states x and y. the notable amplitudes are
a(b, ) and a(b, h), which vanish when the background b eld is set to zero [10]. from
the supergravity side, massless t-pole string amplitudes should be recovered by considering
the three-point interactions through which the long range background eld affects the external
states. an inspection of the low energy supergravity action shows that the possible three-point
interactions involving b elds are of the type b-b-graviton or b-b-dilaton. therefore, the
non-vanishing amplitudes a(b, ) and a(b, h) imply that there exists non-trivial long range
background ns-ns two-form gauge eld. when a constant b eld is turned on on the brane
world-volume, one might try to gauge it away to zero. however, for the directions parallel to
the dp-branes, we can not gauge it away, since it simultaneously involves the transformation
of the world-volume u(1) gauge eld. the seemingly trivial constant b on the world-volume
induces the non-trivial long range background b elds.

4 comparison with supergravity

in this section, we do the tree-level supergravity calculation of the two-point scatterings in the
background geometries proposed in refs. [8, 9]. the main result is that the leading t-pole string
amplitudes computed in section 3 are identical to the long-range supergravity tree amplitudes.

their derivation is based on the chain of t-duality arguments suggested by [1]. actually, the so-
lutions of [8] are related to the solutions of [9] by a b-dependent rescaling of the y-coordinates.
in our string calculations in section 2, we chose g =  and tan i = bi. we note that
the solutions (4.6) are written in such a coordinate system that e  1, ds2  dxdx
and bi  tan i near the asymptotic spatial innity. consistent with section 2, there ex-
ist non-vanishing r-r background elds for the dp-branes (proportional to cos i) and for the
d(p  2)-branes (proportional to sin i) [9], which we do not consider in this paper5.

4.2 tree-level supergravity scatterings

we perform the analysis for the long-distance tree-level supergravity scatterings. adding the
background noncommutative d-branes to our problem is tantamount to adding a source term of
the type [10]

ssource = z d10xg{s

h h + s + s

b b} ,

(4.7)

5to check the consistency of the background r-r gauge elds, we need to consider the two-point scatterings

between ns-ns elds and r-r elds.

figure 2: typical supergravity t-channel scatterings. an incoming particle is scattered by
the background elds to an outgoing particle.

where h,  and b represent the uctuations of graviton (around the at background), dilaton
and the ns-ns two-form gauge eld, respectively. for source-probe type scatterings shown
in fig. 2, there are six possible external state combinations involving massless ns-ns parti-
cles. one can read off the three-point interaction vertices by expanding the low energy effective
action (4.1) in at spacetime background, and we nd that there are four types of such interac-
tions:

4v (, , h) = 2p13p2  p1p2tr(3) ,
4v (b, b, ) = 2p121p2  p1p2tr(12) ,
4v (b, b, h) = p13p2tr(12)  2p1p2tr(132)

and v (h, h, h). for the scatterings shown in fig. 2, the leading non-trivial (r-dependent) back-
ground elds are nothing but

background eld of order

1
r7p = source  propagator .

therefore, we can replace the t-channel exchanged particle part of the diagram in fig. 2 with its
classical background eld. the leading order background elds in einstein frame are computed
to be:

bi = tan i + f i + o(f 2),

4 f (p  3 + tr()) + o(f 2) ,

where i and  are dened in sec. 2 and sec. 3.2, respectively. we compute (b, ), (b, h),
(, ), (, h) and (b, b) scatterings using the vertex (4.8) and the background elds (4.9)6.

6though we have not computed the graviton-graviton scatterings, it is known from the analysis of [10] that

(h, ) and (b, b) scatterings are enough to uniquely determine the graviton and dilaton source terms in (4.7).

figure 3: three-point closed string absorption/emission diagram. on the right hand side,
we show a factorization limit.

for each scattering, the relevant interaction vertices are v (b, b, ), v (b, b, h), v (, , h),
v (, , h), v (b, b, ) + v (b, b, h), respectively. the nal results are identical to (3.16)
and (3.17). in this fashion, our string theory calculations justify the supergravity solutions of
refs. [8, 9].

5 absorption and emission by noncommutative d-branes

while the two-point scatterings computed in section 3 can be used to justify the background
geometries, the two-point scatterings do not exhibit the exponential phase factor used to de-
ne the -product [6, 15]. the simplest non-trivial example showing such phase factor is the
string emission/absorption diagram from/to noncommutative dp-branes as shown in fig. 3. in
itself, this amplitude is important, for it shows nontrivial modications of the hawking radia-
tion spectrum from the near-extremal noncommutative dp-brane black holes, when compared
to emissions from commutative dp-brane black holes. most notably, we nd that the pole struc-
ture of the amplitude changes as we turn on the b eld, and the exponential phase factors show
up.

as t = 2p1  p2. the open string momenta p1 and p2 are restricted to lie along the d-brane
world-volume, and the momentum is conserved along the directions parallel to the branes

(5.6)

it was noted in ref. [10] that this amplitude has poles for half integer values of t, but has zeros
for integer values of t, summarized by a sort of zz2 selection rule. in particular, there is no
massless pole. as we will see shortly, the situation drastically changes as we turn on the b
eld.

5.2 turning on the b eld

we can include the effect of the background b eld by placing the matrix r at appropriate
places, as was done in section 2. the closed string vertex operators change in the same way as
in eqs. (3.10) and (3.11) and the open string vertex operators become

vo(w; mp, m), m 

1
2

(r + rt ) .

(5.7)

under these modications, again paying attention to the xing of the sl(2, ir) invariance, we
obtain the following amplitude:

where we introduce

tr(d) is replaced by tr(d+). second, contractions of any two of the open string quantities

12

(p1, p2, 1, 2) are made with respect to the open string metric g. accordingly, for example,
t is now dened as t = 2p1gp2. third, contractions of two closed string quantities (, q)
do not change. finally, for contractions of an open string quantity and a closed string quantity,
we insert (g + ). for example,

q  (g + )q.

(5.10)

the second and third rules are natural, since g is felt by open strings and the  is felt by
closed strings.

an important feature of the amplitude (5.8) is that its pole structures are distinctively dif-
ferent from the commutative case, eq. (5.5). we rst consider a non-zero value of t. when
 is neither integral nor half-integral, the amplitude eq. (5.8) has poles for both integral and
half-integral values of t. when t = m   where m = 1, 2,  , it has zeros. when  is integral,
the usual commutative zz2 selection rule applies: the amplitude has zeros for integral values of
t and poles for half-integral values of t. when  is half-integral, the situation reverses itself: the
amplitude has zeros for half-integral values of t and poles for integral values of t. near t = 0,
we can use the formula

to nd

(1 + x)(1  x) =

x

eqs. (5.11) and (5.12) have further implication. by repeated use of (1 + x) = x(x) and

eq. (5.11), the three-point amplitude eq. (5.8) can be written as

a = a0 exp(i)  a0 exp(i) ,

(5.13)

where a0 is an odd function under   , for integral values of t including t = 0. we notice
that the exponential factors are exactly what one expects from the noncommutative yang-mills
-product. in fig. 3, there are two possible factorization channels, one with p1 on top (the shown
gure) and another with p2 on top (the ipped gure which is not shown). the amplitude (5.13),
which is an even function under    can be thought of as the sum of contributions from
these two diagrams. the exponential factors, following [6] for the three open string insertions,
will be

p1p2 + p1qk + p2qk = p1p2  qkqk = p1p2 ,

(5.14)

where we used the momentum conservation (5.4) along the parallel directions to the branes.
again using the same momentum conservation, we observe that  can be considered as being
linearly proportional to the external momentum qk and does not vanish as long as qk is not zero.

6 discussions

it is remarkable that the simple imposition of the boundary conditions as in section 2 allows us
to study rather intricate dp-d(p  2) bound states. furthermore, the modications that occur
due to the constant b in the string calculations are straightforwardly accomplished by placing
the matrix r (or rt ) of section 2 at appropriate places of computations.

the closed string absorption/emission amplitudes computed in section 5 show some novel
features, such as the occurrence of the exponential phase factors depending linearly on the
external closed string momentum. their pole and zero structures are also drastically modied
as we turn on the b eld. an interesting issue is to capture some of these features through
the supergravity absorption calculations along the line of, for example, ref. [17]. this kind of
comparison in fact gave some of motivations for the ads/cft correspondence conjecture for
commutative d-branes [7]. in the context of noncommutative d-branes, the situation is much
more subtle, for example, because the dp-branes seemingly turn into d(p  2)-branes in the
large b limit.

there are some immediate technical generalizations to the analysis presented in this paper.
first, one can consider the scatterings of the bulk r-r elds.
in particular, this allows us
to check the consistency between the classical r-r background elds of [9] and the string
calculations by considering the scatterings between the r-r elds and the ns-ns elds. further
works along this line are in progress and will be reported elsewhere [18]. secondly, one would
like to extend the disk diagram analysis to the annulus diagrams, incorporating the open string
loop effects.

it is amusing to compare our calculation of the correlation functions to the gravitational
back-reactions considered in ref. [19]. the three-point amplitudes computed in section 5 rep-
resent the absorption of ns-ns matter elds into noncommutative dp-branes. as analyzed
in [19], when almost light-like matter falls into a black hole, due to the energy conservation,
the horizon radius gets increased; this effect translates to the shift of the horizon along the
incoming null-direction and can thus be represented by the exponential phase proportional to
the incoming momentum, or the shift operator. the three-point amplitudes show the similar

14

exponential phase factor linearly proportional to the external momentum of the absorbed mat-
ter. the formal similarity might go further; the four-point amplitudes of type where there are
two closed string vertex insertions in the bulk and two boundary open string vertex insertions
has a factorization channel where two closed string vertices approach the open string bound-
ary. in this limit, at least, it apparently appears possible to expect an exponential phase factor
that depends quadratically on the external momenta, which, if exists, would correspond to the
space-time noncommutativity induced by the world-volume noncommutativity. this type of
four-point amplitudes represents the interaction between the emitted hawking radiation and the
absorbed matters. in ref. [19], there are similar interaction effects summarized by the following
exchange algebra, which corresponds to a version of space-time noncommutativity:

in(pin)out(pout) = eipinpoutout(pout)in(pin),

(6.1)

where in represents the absorbed matter and out represents the emitted hawking radiation. in
eq. (6.1), we notice an exponential phase factor that depends quadratically on the external mo-
menta. it remains to be seen whether there is any reason why the space-time noncommutativity
in eq. (6.1) (due to the graviton exchanges near the black hole horizon) is formally similar to
the possible space-time noncommutativity induced by the background b eld.
