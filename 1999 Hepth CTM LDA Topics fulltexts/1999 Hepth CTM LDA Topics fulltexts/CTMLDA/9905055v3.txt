abstract

it is known that if we compactify d0-branes on a torus with constant b-eld,

the resulting theory becomes sym theory on a noncommutative dual torus. we

discuss the extension to the case of an h-eld background. in the case of a constant

h-eld on a three-torus, we derive the constraints to realize this compactication by

considering the correspondence to string theory. we carry out this work as a rst

step to examine the possibility to describe transverse m5-branes in matrix theory.

introduction

since the proposal of matrix theory [1] as a nonperturbative formulation of m-theory
in the innite momentum frame or dlcq of m-theory [2], it has passed various kinds of
consistency tests [3]. because the action of matrix theory is equivalent to a regularized
action of supermembrane in the light cone gauge [4], the relation of membranes to matrix
theory is clear, and fundamental strings can also be described in matrix theory [5].

as for m5-branes, the situation is more obscure [6, 8, 7]. in [8], the supersymmetry
algebra was examined for nite n matrix theory, and various brane charge densities were
identied. while the charge density of longitudinal m5-brane wrapping 11th direction
really emerged as a central charge, that of transverse m5-brane wasnt found. in [9], a
matrix model describing open membranes was formulated in the light cone gauge, mo-
tivated by the idea to describe m5-branes as boundaries on which open membranes can
attach. however, there was also diculty in describing transverse m5-branes. these situ-
ations are very unsatisfactory form the viewpoint of 11-dimensional lorentz symmetry. in
general, brane charges are expected to merge in the large n limit, where 11-dimensional
lorentz symmetry should be hold. then we consider that there still remain possibilities
to describe transverse m5-branes in matrix theory, if we consider some particular large
n limit.

on the other hand, it was shown that the usual compactication of matrix theory on
tori [10, 7] can be extended to noncommutative cases [11]. in the usual compactication
on t d, the resulting theory becomes sym theory on a dual torus. this can be extended
to sym theory on a noncommutative dual torus. there, the parameters of the noncom-
mutativity were constant, and their physical interpretation was argued to be the uxes
of the three-index gauge eld cij [11]. this eld corresponds to bij in type iia string
theory. this noncommutative nature was derived in [12] -[17] from various points of view.
since this fact shows that we can deal with cij background in matrix theory, this
leads us to an another possibility of a description of transverse m5-branes. if we succeed
to nd a way to describe the backgrounds corresponding to non-zero transverse m5-brane
charge in matrix theory, the resulting theory might describe transverse m5-branes. since
transverse m5-branes correspond to ns5-branes in type iia string theory, for example,
we need to consider a background satisfying

1

2 is3

h = 2n .

(1.1)

to do this, we have to nd a way to treat space dependent bij .1 instead of eq.(1.1), as
1in [18], an extension to non-constant bi j was discussed using deformation quantization theory.
there, bi j depends on the position of the dual compact space. however, we need bi j depending on the
position of the original compact space t 3 not but dual space.

1

a rst step in this direction, we will consider a background satisfying

1

2 it 3

h = 2n ,

(1.2)

because this is the simplest and nontrivial extension of the case in [11].

in this paper, we will consider a low energy system of d0-branes, and discuss how to
realize the compactication on t 3 with the background bij satisfying eq.(1.2). we assume
that this compactication can be realized in matrix theory with suitable constraints on
the matrices similar to those in [10]. we will discuss what constraints we need from the
correspondence to string theory in a similar way to [13]. we will nd that the center of
mass coordinates of d0-branes no longer decouple from the remaining degrees of freedom.
we also discuss the relation to the ordinary noncommutative torus compactication.

2. three-torus with an h-eld background

let us consider the compactication of matrix theory on a rectangular torus. for at
background, the lagrangian of matrix theory is given by the low energy lagrangian of
d0-branes in ten dimensions,

1

l =

2gs

tr((dtx i)2 +
i
2 t dt 

+

1

2(2)2 [x i, x j ]2
(2)2 t i[x i, ]) ,
1

(2.1)

where i, j = 1,   , 9. here, the appropriate   0 limit specied in [19, 20] must
be taken to make this system correspond to m-theory in 11 dimensions. as it is well
known, for the usual compactication on t d with radii ri, we should impose the quotient
condition on the matrices [10, 7],

u 1

i x iui = x i + 2rii,i
u 1

i ui =  ,

i = 1,   , d

(2.2)

where ui are unitary operators. this relation means that x i +2ri is equivalent to x i up
to a unitary transformation. from the consistency of these relations, uiuju 1
j must
commute to x i and , so we obtain [11]

i u 1

uiuj = e2iij ujui .

(2.3)

for the case where ij are constant, their physical interpretation is argued to be the uxes
of bij integrated on the t 2 extending xi and xj directions [11]-[17].

2

in this paper we would like to consider a t 3 compactication with a non-zero h123

background, which is topologically quantized as

t2it 3

h = 2n ,

(2.4)

where t2 is 1/2 and n is an integer. in this case, bij are not constant and depend on
the position in t 3, so the above procedure of toroidal compactication can not be applied.
the quotient condition must be modied. in this paper we will discuss how to modify
the usual quotient condition to describe the torus compactication with non-zero h eld.
throughout the paper, we mainly consider the case of a d0-brane compactied on t 3,
because the extension to n d0-branes is straightforward.

let us assume that (x1, x2, x3) directions are compactied on t 3 and we have constant

h123. for simplicity we take bij as

b12(x3) =

1

(2)3r1r2r3

2n
t2

x3 ,

(2.5)

and b23 = b31 = 0. this conguration is topologically nontrivial and the boundary
condition of bij is specied introducing a nontrivial gauge transformation

b(x3 + 2r3) = b(x3) + d(1) ,

where (1) is a 1-form eld. to be specic, we take as

 (1)
2 ! =  

1
(1)

1

(2)2r1r2

0
2n
t2

(x1  y1)! ,

(2.6)

(2.7)

where for later convenience we have included yi, which are position coordinates of the
d0-brane on the t 3 dened up to 2ri.

condition on string eld

let us make sure that a d0-brane can really exist in the background bij. because
the bij is dened using the gauge transformation (2.6), the matter eld coupling to bij
must be dened by the corresponding gauge transformation. this matter eld is a string
eld. in the covering space of t 3, that is r3, there are innite mirrors of the d0-brane,
which form a lattice. let us label the d0-branes as (a, b, c), where a, b, c are the integers
which indicate the position of the d0-branes on the lattice. there are strings connecting
any two d0-branes. for strings which starts from (a, b, c) and ends at (a, b, c), let us
introduce a string eld operator

(a,b,c)(a,b,c) .

(2.8)

this string eld must satisfy the boundary condition corresponding to that of bij.

3

in general, the gauge transformation of string eld or string wave functional can be
decided by requiring the invariance of string transition amplitudes. let us consider a open
string whose end points are on general d-branes. the transition amplitude is written by

z [dxd] (c2, t2)(c1, t1) eisstring ,

(2.9)

where (ci, ti) are string wave functionals for string paths ci. when b transforms as

b  b + (1) ,

(2.10)

the string wave functionals and 1-form gauge elds a on the d-branes have to transform
as

(c)  exp(it2zc
a  a  (1)

(1)) (c)

(2.11)

(2.12)

to keep the amplitude invariant.

in the case of the background we are considering, corresponding to eq.(2.6), the string

eld has to satisfy the boundary condition

(a,b,c+1)(a,b,c+1) = exp(it2zpath

(1)) (a,b,c)(a,b,c) .

(2.13)

since we are considering the low energy limit, the path can be taken as the straight path
connecting the two d0-branes. substituting eq.(2.7) into eq.(2.13), we obtain

(a,b,c+1)(a,b,c+1) = ein(a+a)(bb) (a,b,c)(a,b,c) .

(2.14)

for the translation in x1 or x2 direction, we dont need any gauge transformation, then

(a+1,b,c)(a+1,b,c) = (a,b,c)(a,b,c)

(a,b+1,c)(a,b+1,c) = (a,b,c)(a,b,c)

(2.15)

must be satised. we can easily see that these conditions (2.14) and (2.15) are consistent
each other. therefore we can say that the background under consideration is really
consistent. note here that in order for the consistency to hold, n has to be quantized as
a integer.

3. constraints for the compactication

in this section we will consider how to realize the the system specied in the last
section in matrix theory. we assume that this system can be described by matrix theory

4

with some constraints similar to eq.(2.2). we will examin what constraint is necessary
from the correspondence to string theory.

naively o diagonal matrix elements of matrix theory correspond to the components

of the string eld as

x i

(a,b,c)(a,b,c)

? i

(a,b,c)(a,b,c) ,

(3.1)

but they are not exactly equivalent when background b eld exists. in [13], in the case of
constant b eld on t 2, the authors showed that ordinary products between string elds
must be replaced with the -products. essentially, the -product is equivalent to the
noncommutative relation (2.3).on the other hand, in the case of non-constant b eld,
the same argument cannot be applied, but we will see that we can consider in a similar
way.

interaction term

in the matrix theory action (2.1), there are products of four o diagonal matrix

elements. then, let us consider the product

i4 = x i1

(a1,b1,c1)(a2,b2,c2)x i2

(a2,b2,c2)(a3,b3,c3)    x i4

(a4,b4,c4)(a1,b1,c1) .

(3.2)

the corresponding four open strings form a closed path, and we interpret that this term
describes an interaction between the four open strings (gure 1). then this term should
correspond to

4 = f i1
i 

(a1,b1,c1)(a2,b2,c2)i2

(a2,b2,c2)(a3,b3,c3)    i4

(a4,b4,c4)(a1,b1,c1) ,

(3.3)

where we have included an unknown additional factor f to represent the correction by
the b eld. we will discuss this correction in the following.

figure 1: interaction of four open strings

let us consider a string world sheet  whose boundary is given by the four open
strings. when we move the d0-brane on t 3 a little in x3 direction, that is y3  y3 + y3,

5

the world sheet shifts as   new keeping its shape. the value of the sting action
evaluated on the world sheet changes as

sstring = t2(cid:20)znew

b z

b(cid:21)

n

= z

dx1dx2

(2)2r1r2r3

y3 ,

(3.4)

where we have substituted the explicit form of b. here the important point is that sstring
is decided only by the boundary of  because the integrand in eq.(3.4) is constant. since
sstring changes by sstring, i 

4 should have dependence on y3 as

4(y3 + y3) = i 
i 

4(y3) eisstring ,

(3.5)

and the factor f in eq.(3.3) should have this y3 dependence. eq.(3.4) is proportional to
the area of the tetragon projected on (x1, x2) plane from the tetragon decided by the four
open strings, and we have

sstring = n

y3
r3

1
2{(a1b2  a2b1) + (a2b3  a3b2)

+(a3b4  a4b3) + (a4b1  a1b4)} .

from eqs.(3.5) and (3.6), we see that if i 

4 is written as

i 

4(y3)  ein y3

r3

1

2 (a1b2+a2b1)i1

(a1,b1,c1)(a2,b2,c2)    ein y3

r3

1

2 (a4b1+a1b4)i4

(a4,b4,c4)(a1,b1,c1),

(3.6)

(3.7)

it has the desired y3 dependence. since i 
the correspondence between x i and i must be modied as

4 should correspond to i4, eq.(3.7) suggests that

x i

(a,b,c)(a,b,c)  ein y3

r3

1

2 (ab+ab)i

(a,b,c)(a,b,c) .

(3.8)

here we have ambiguity in the additional factor ein y3
2 (ab+ab) in this relation. for
example, if we replace (ab + ab) with (a + a)(b b) or (a a)(b + b), i4 still has the
same y3 dependence. in these replacements the individual matrix elements x i
change but the products like

(a,b,c)(a,b,c)

r3

1

x i1(y3)(a1,b1,c1)(a2,b2,c2)    x ik(y3)(ak,bk,ck)(a1,b1,c1)

(3.9)

dont change at all. then we consider that these replacements dont occur any physical
in addition we can replace y3 with y3+(constant) in eq.(3.8). this shift
dierence.
corresponds to the change b12  b12 + (constant). from these considerations we adopt
the relation (3.8). in section 5., we will have an argument which supports this relation.

note that the product (3.9) produces a desired phase factor under the global shift of
y3, that is cj  cj + 1 or y3  y3 + 2r3 in addition to the local shift of y3. if we shift

6

each cj as cj  cj + 1, the product produces a factor due to eq.(2.14). this factor is
consistent with the change of the string action sstring under this shift.

the important point of eq.(3.8) is that the center of mass coordinate y3 of the d-
brane doesnt decouple from the remaining degrees of freedom any longer.
in original
matrix theory this decoupling occurs, but this is not the case when an h eld background
exists. this result is the main nontrivial feature of the compactication with an h eld
background.

constraints

let us summarize the condition on the matrices for the t 3 compactication under

consideration. x i must depend on y3 as

x i(y3)(a,b,c)(a,b,c) = ein y3

r3

1

2 (ab+ab)x i(0)(a,b,c)(a,b,c) ,

(3.10)

where

y3 = x 3

(a,b,c)(a,b,c)

(mod 2r3) .

the o diagonal matrix elements must satisfy the conditions

x i(0)(a+1,b,c)(a+1,b,c) = x i(0)(a,b,c)(a,b,c)
x i(0)(a,b+1,c)(a,b+1,c) = x i(0)(a,b,c)(a,b,c)
x i(0)(a,b,c+1)(a,b,c+1) = ein(a+a)(bb)x i(0)(a,b,c)(a,b,c) .

for the diagonal matrix elements, we have the conditions

x i(0)(a+1,b,c)(a+1,b,c) = x i(0)(a,b,c)(a,b,c) + 2r1i,1
x i(0)(a,b+1,c)(a,b+1,c) = x i(0)(a,b,c)(a,b,c) + 2r2i,2
x i(0)(a,b,c+1)(a,b,c+1) = x i(0)(a,b,c)(a,b,c) + 2r3i,3 .

(3.11)

(3.12)

note here that the relation

x i(y3 + 2r3)(a,b,c)(a,b,c) = x i(y3)(a,b,c+1)(a,b,c+1)

(3.13)

is satised. as for the fermionic part (a,b,c)(a,b,c), we have conditions similar to eqs.(3.10)
and (3.11) for both o-diagonal and diagonal matrix elements.

solutions to the constraints

let us consider the general solution to the conditions (3.10)  (3.11). using the

conditions, any o diagonal elements can be expressed as

x i(y3)(a,b,c)(a,b,c) = ein(aa)(bb)c

ein y3

r3

1

2 [(aa)b+(bb)a] x i(0)(aa,bb,cc)(0,0,0) .

(3.14)

7

here, we used ein(aa)(bb)c instead of ein(a+a)(bb)c. let us represent x i as operators
on a space of functions

v(i) = xa,b,c

v(a,b,c)eia1/1eib2/2eic3/3 ,

(3.15)

where v(a,b,c) is a vector on which the original matrices x i operate, and i = /ri are
the radii of the dual torus2. the general solution to the conditions (3.10)  (3.11) can
be expressed as

x i(j; u3) = (2)(cid:16)ii + ai(j; u3)(cid:17) ,

i = 1, 2, 3

ai(i; u3) = xp,q,r

ai

(p,q,r) eip1/1eiq2/2eir3/3 enpq33 en 1

2 3u3(p22+q11) .

(3.16)

(3.17)

here u3 is related to y3 by

(3.18)
as for x a(j; u3) (a = 4,   , 9) and (j; u3), they are expressed in the same form as
eq.(3.17).

u3 = y3/ = 2a3

(0,0,0) .

4. action

so far we have considered the interaction terms in matrix theory. let us now consider

the kinetic term

tr[(dtx i)2] .

since x i has time dependence through y3(t) as well as usual one, we have

(4.1)

(4.2)

d
dt

x i(t; y3(t)) =


t

x i(t; y3(t))(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)y3 + y3 

y3 x i(t; y3(t)) .

however, due to the second term in eq.(4.2) and eq.(3.10),

d
dt

x i(t; y3(t))(a,b,c)(a,b,c)

d
dt

xi(t; y3(t))(a,b,c)(a,b,c)

(4.3)

turns out to be not invariant under the shift a, a  a + 1, a + 1. we have to construct
a theory which is invariant under the shifts like this because we would like to obtain a
theory compactied on t 3. on the other hand if we replace d
tx i|y3 in eq.(4.3),
the corresponding product turns out to be invariant under these shifts. this fact suggests
that we should interpret x i as 
tx i|y3. in the original matrix theory lagrangian in at
space, d
tx i|y3 are equivalent, then we consider that there is no contradiction
in this interpretation.

dt x i with 

dt x i and 

2we have a space dependent b eld background, so there is not a t-duality between t 3  t 3 from

the viewpoint of string theory.

8

before we write down the resulting action explicitly, let us briey comment on the
generalization to the case where there are n d0-branes on t 3. in this case we should
interpret y3 as the center of mass coordinate of the n d0-branes. each matrix element
x i
(a,b,c,)(a,b,c) is generalized to a matrix x i kl
(a,b,c,)(a,b,c), where k, l = 1,   , n. for each
(k, l) we have the same conditions as eqs.(3.10)  (3.12).

the nal lagrangian can be obtained under the replacements

2 , and

f = a  a + i[a, a]
dx a = x a + i[a, x a] ,

d =  + i[a, ] .

(4.6)

(4.7)

the action (4.5) appears to be the ordinary sym action on the dual torus. however, the
elds a, x a and  are not ordinary n  n matrices. each element of the matrices isnt
a function but an operator which is written as

[ai(i; u3)]kl = xp,q,r
(p,q,r)]kl = [ai

where [ai

(p,q,r)]

[ai

(4.9)

then, the action (4.5) includes a nontrivial interaction between the u(1) part of the gauge
eld u3 and the remaining su(n) part.

5. connection with noncommutative geometry

in this section we will make clear the connection of the constraints obtained in section
3. with the noncommutative algebra in the literature3 of noncommutative torus compact-
ication. to do this, we will reformulate the quotient condition into a form similar to
eqs.(2.2) and (2.3).

3for example, see [21, 22, 23, 24].

9

for a while, let us concentrate our attention only on (a, b) indices of the matrices

x i(y3), and consider the trace with respect to (a, b) indices

xai,bi

x i1(y3)(a1,b1,c1)(a2,b2,c2)x i2(y3)(a2,b2,c2)(a3,b3,c3)    x ik(y3)(ak,bk,ck)(a1,b1,c1) (5.1)
 tr(cid:16)x i1(y3)x i2(y3)    x ik(y3)(cid:17) .

by bringing together the y3 dependence of all x ii(y3), the trace can be written as

x i1(0)(a1,b1,c1)(a2,b2,c2)    x ik(0)(ak,bk,ck)(a1,b1,c1)ein y3

(5.3)

and  is equivalent to the area of the k-polygon decided by the k vertices (ai, bi) (gure
2). let us change the way to calculate the area and divide the k-polygon into triangles as
in gure 2. then  turns into a sum of the areas of the triangles, and can be written as

 = 1

2 {(a1  a2, b1  b2)  (a2  a3, b2  b3) + (a1  a3, b1  b3)  (a3  a4, b3  b4)

this -product is dened only with respect to (a, b) indices and we dont carry out the
summation with respect to c indices, so that we have used the notation  instead of usual
. the -product is almost same as the ordinary -product. however, the parameter
(y3) is not just a constant but it is dependent on the dynamical variable y3. using the
-product, it is not dicult to show that the trace eq.(5.2) can be written as
x i1(0)x i2(0)  x ik(0) .

tr(cid:16)x i1(y3)x i2(y3)    x ik(y3)(cid:17) = xa1,b1

in the denition of the -product on the right hand side. in other words, if we use the
y3-dependent -products instead of the usual products, we can think x i independent of
y3.
since it is known that the eect of the -product is equivalent to the algebra of ui

satisfying the noncommutative relation

u1 u2 = ei2(y3) u2 u1
u1 u3 = u3 u1 ,

u2 u3 = u3 u2 ,

(5.8)

the constraints obtained in section 3. can be put into a form similar to eq.(2.2). let us
follow [24], and rewrite the quotient condition. introducing the operators i dened by4

[i, uj] = i ujij ,

(5.9)

we dene the unitary operators ui by

u1 = u1e2(y3)2 ,

u2 = u2e2(y3)1 ,

u3 = u3 .

(5.10)

then ui and uj commute each other, and ui satisfy the noncommutative relation

u1u2 = ei2(y3)u2u1

u1u3 = u3u1 ,

u2u3 = u3u2 .

(5.11)

using ui, the quotient condition corresponding to eqs.(3.10)  (3.12) can be written as

u 1
1 x iu1 = x i + 2r1i,1
2 x iu2 = x i + 2r2i,2
u 1
3 x iu3 = hein12x ii + 2r3i,3 .
u 1

(5.12)

here, y3 = 1
by

n tr (x 3) (mod 2r3), and we introduced the operators i which are dened

4these i dont correspond to i in eq.(3.16). in this section we change the normalization to make

clear the correspondence, for example, to [24].

in the third equation of (5.12) we have introduced the operation [ein12   ], so as to
incorpolate the eect of the gauge transformation of the string eld, eq.(2.14). so the
quotient condition eq.(5.12) is a little dierent from that of t d compactication with
constant b-eld, eq.(2.2).

in units where 2 = 1, the general solution to eq.(5.12) corresponding to the trivial

bundle is given by

x i = 2irii + [en123ai( uj)] ,
x a = [en123x a( uj)] ,

a = 4,   , 9 ,

i = 1, 2, 3

(5.14)

(5.15)

where ai( uj) and x a( uj) are arbitrary power functions of uj. in order to make clear
the correspondence of the description in this section to that in section 3, let us com-
pare eq.(5.14) with eqs.(3.16) and (3.17). the eect of the factor en 1
2 3u3(p22+q11) in
eq.(3.17) is realized through the y3-dependent noncommutative relation (5.8). but the fac-
tor enpq33 in eq.(3.17) still remains and it has turned into the operation [en123   ]
in eq.(5.14).

the quotient condition (5.12) can also be applied to the case of n d0-branes. although
we dont discuss solutions corresponding to twisted bundles explicitly, we expect that they
also exist as in [23, 24].

6. conclusion

in this paper, we considered d0-branes compactied on t 3 with an h-eld background.
we assumed that this system can be described by matrix theory with some appropriate
constraints on the matrices. then we examined what constraints we should impose in
order for the resulting theory to be consistent with string theory. we obtained eqs.(3.10)
 (3.12) as the constraints. we put the constraints into a form where the noncommutative
relation is apparent, eqs.(5.11) and (5.12).

the resulting theory is not ordinary super yang-mills theory on a noncommutative
in the case of an h-eld
three-torus as in the case of constant background b-eld.
background, the parameter of noncommutativity  is not a constant, but it becomes
y3-dependent and dynamical. thus, in general, the center of mass coordinates of the d0-
branes dont decouple from the remaining degrees of freedom any longer. we also have
to introduce an additonal operation [en123   ] in the gauge eld on the dual torus,
eq.(5.14), in order to incorpolate the eect of the gauge transformation of the string eld,
eq.(2.14). these are the main dierences from the compactication with constant b-eld.
we investigated this system as a rst step to examine the possibility to describe
transverse m5-branes in matrix theory. transverse m5-branes correspond to ns5-branes
in type iia sting theory. does this system have a corresponding 5-brane charge? let us

12

consider the relation of the background we discussed and ns-5branes. for example, for
n = 1 case the background corresponds to the conguration where oppositely charged
two ns5-branes are innitely away from each other in one of the directions transverse to
t 3. thus the total brane charge is zero, and we cant expect nonzero brane charge. we
consider, however, that it will be very interesting to examine whether the discussion in
this paper can be extended to the case of a background with nonzero 5-brane charge.

it would also be interesting to examine the relation of the present formalism to the
matrix theory in weak background elds [25] and supermembrane theory in an arbitrary
sugra background [26].
