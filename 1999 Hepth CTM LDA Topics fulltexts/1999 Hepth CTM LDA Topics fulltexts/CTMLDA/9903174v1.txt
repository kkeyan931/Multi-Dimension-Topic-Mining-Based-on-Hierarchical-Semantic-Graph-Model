abstract

we have developed n = 1 supersymmetric nonlinear realization methods,

which realize global symmetry breaking in n = 1 supersymmetric theories.

the target space of nonlinear sigma models with a linear model origin is a gc-

orbit, which is a non-compact non-homogeneous kahler manifold. we show

that, if and only if the orbit is open, it includes a compact homogeneous kahler

manifold as a submanifold, and a class of strictly g-invariant kahler potentials

reduces to a kahler potential g-invariant up to a kahler transformation on

the submanifold. hence, in the case of an open orbit, the most general low-

energy eective kahler potential can be written as the sum of those of the

compact submanifolds and an arbitrary function of strictly g-invariants.

1 introduction

supersymmetric nonlinear sigma models [1, 31] have been used in many physical

applications, such as low-energy eective lagrangians of supersymmetric gauge the-

ories [2, 3] and coset unication models [4].

in gauge theories, the target spaces of nonlinear sigma models are the classical

(or quantum modied) moduli spaces. they are obtained by integrating out gauge

elds which obtain masses by the higgs mechanism. in supersymmetric theories, this

procedure can be understood by the method of the kahler quotient [5]. on the other

hand, in the case of global symmetry breaking, low-energy eective lagrangians can

be obtained by integrating out massive elds, such as higgs elds. the target

manifolds can be constructed by a method involving the nonlinear realization of

global symmetry [7]. (these two procedures just correspond to solving the d-term

or f-term atness conditions [6].) much progress concerning nonlinear realization

in supersymmetric theories has been made by many authors [1, 8][25].1 a coupling

to gauge elds has been discussed in ref. [23], a coupling to matter elds in ref. [8,

19, 24] and supersymmetric wess-zumino-witten terms in ref. [25].

in this paper, we consider global symmetry breaking without gauge symmetry,

and develop a supersymmetric nonlinear realization method.

in general, when a global symmetry g breaks down to its subgroup h, there

appear quasi nambu-goldstone (qng) bosons besides ordinary nambu-goldstone

(ng) bosons. the low-energy eective lagrangian is a nonlinear sigma model, whose

target space is a kahler manifold, and is parameterized by ng and qng bosons.

(low-energy theorems of these scattering amplitudes are discussed in refs. [21, 22].)
the target space can be written as a complex coset space as gc/ h, where gc is a
complexication of g and h is a complex group which includes a complexication

of h. the kahler potentials of a g-invariant eective lagrangian are constructed

by bando, kuramoto, maskawa and uehara (bkmu) [8]. there are three types

of g-invariant kahler potentials: a-, b- and c-type. the a- and c-type kahler

we recommend ref. [27].

potentials are strictly g-invariant; on the other hand, the b-type kahler potentials

are, in general, g-invariant up to a kahler transformation.

if there is any qng boson, the target manifold becomes a non-compact non-

homogeneous manifold; on the other hand, if there is no qng boson, the target

manifold is a compact homogeneous manifold.

itoh, kugo and kunitomo (ikk)

showed that a kahler potential of a compact homogeneous kahler manifold can be

completely written as a sum of b-type kahler potentials. (these are called pure re-

alizations.) [10]. all compact homogeneous kahler manifolds have been completely

classied in ref. [11]. moreover, coset unication models are based on these compact

models [4]. hence, many authors have studied compact models [10][13]. however,

unfortunately, these models have no linear-model origin in the case of global symme-

try breaking (without gauge symmetry) [9].2 the target space of global symmetry

breaking must be a non-compact non-homogeneous manifold [9, 17, 18].

buchmuller and ellwanger have considered models where some central charges

in h are broken by hand from compact homogeneous models [14, 15, 16].

(we

call these models as broken center models.) these models are non-compact non-

homogeneous, and have strictly g-invariant kahler potentials besides b-type kahler

potentials. however, it is not known whether they have linear-model origins.

we, thus, consider non-compact non-homogeneous kahler manifolds which have

linear-model origins.

it is known that such models can have strictly g-invariant

kahler potentials [9, 17, 18, 20]. thus, there remain a question:

is there any b-

type kahler potential in a model with a linear-model origin? in this paper, we

give an answer to this question. the idea is that we can consider submanifolds of

the total target manifold and can add kahler potentials of the submanifolds to the

total kahler potential. we nd that, in a model with a linear-model origin, b-type

kahler potentials are strictly g-invariant and are not independent of a- or c-type

invariants. nevertheless, we show that if the orbit is open, the kahler manifold,
gc/ h, has a compact kahler submanifold, gc/ h, and b-type kahler potentials
on gc/ h reduce to those on gc/ h; also, if the orbit is closed, it does not have

2 in the case where there is a gauge symmetry, we can sometimes construct compact models

with linear origins.

2

any compact kahler submanifold, and b-type kahler potentials are still strictly g-
invariant. here, h is a complex subgroup of gc and includes h as a subgroup,
h  h; it is obtained by changing some broken generators in gc  h to unbroken
(therefore, gc/ h includes gc/ h as a submanifold.) we
generators by hand.3

can thus add b-type kahler potential on compact submanifolds to the full kahler

potential in an open orbit. moreover, this open-orbit model coincides with a special

class of the broken-center models considered by buchmuller and ellwanger [14, 15,

16]. we, thus, also nd a linear origin of special cases of these models.

we can conclude that pure realizations [10] are not just mathematical models,

but are embedded in open orbits with linear-model origins.

this paper is organized as follows. in sec. 2, we show that target spaces of sigma

models are obtained as gc-orbits of the vacuum. they can be classied by the value

of gc-invariants. to be precise, we treat the o(n) model. in this model, there are

two kinds of gc-orbits: one is a closed orbit, and the other is an open orbit. we

show that, although these orbits have very similar properties, an essential point is

dierent on the both orbits: the closed orbit does not have a borel subalgebra in
the complex isotropy, h; on the other hand, the open orbit has it.

in sec. 3, strictly g-invariant kahler potentials, the a- and c-types, are con-

structed by the method of bkmu. although this section does not have any new

result, we use the result in sec. 4.

in sec. 4, we discuss kahler potentials g-invariant up to a kahler transformation,

the b-type kahler potentials. we nd that, although they are strictly g-invariant

and are not independent of a- or c-type kahler potentials, they can be reduced to

b-type kahler potentials on a compact submanifold, if and only if the orbit is open.

sec. 5 is devoted to conclusions and discussions.

in app. a, we construct the kahler potential of the compact homogeneous kahler
manifold o(n)/o(n  2)  u(1) by using the method of ikk [10]. since it is
embedded to the open orbit, this appendix is used in sec. 4.

3 we use latin characters as lie algebras of the corresponding lie groups.

2 classication of gc-orbits

gc-orbits can be characterized by the values of gc-invariants composed of funda-

mental elds.

in general, depending on their value, there exist closed orbits and

open orbits. as an example, let us consider the o(n) model. it has both closed and

open orbits. the closed orbits of this model have been discussed in refs. [20, 22]. in

this section we investigate both orbits, and nd that they have essentially dierent

properties.

2.1 gc-invariants and gc-orbits

we rst prepare fundamental elds, ~  v , which belong to a representation n
of g = o(n). here, v is a representation space, and it is complexied by the

supersymmetry: v = cn . since a superpotential includes only chiral superelds,

its g-invariance leads to gc-invariance. assume that there appear an eective

superpotential,

w = g0(~ 2  f 2) ,

(2.1)

where 0 is a gc-singlet lagrange multiplier eld, which has no d-term and g is

a constant. here f 2 is also a constant and can be taken as being real by a eld

redenition of 0. by integrating out 0 (eliminating 0 by its equation of motion),
we obtain a nonlinear eld space, m of ~ which is embedded in v by a constraint,

~ 2  f 2 = 0 .

(2.2)

since there is only one gc-invariant and it is xed, the eld space m is a manifold

with a gc-transitive action, namely a gc-orbit:

m = {g  ~v|~v  v, g  gc} ,

(2.3)

where ~v  v is an arbitrary vector satisfying ~v 2 = f 2. the complex dimension of
m is dimc m = dimc v  1 = n  1, since one gc-invariant is xed.

4

figure 1

the vertical axis is taken as re v n , the horizontal axis is taken as im v n 1 and the central point

is the origin. there exist four kinds of orbits. orbit i consists of the upper and lower hyperbola

and orbit ii of the left and right hyperbola. although they look separated in this gure, they are

continuous through other directions of v . orbit iii looks like a cone, and orbit iv is the origin.

there exist four types of gc-orbits, which can be classied by the value of the

gc-invariant f 2 (see fig. 1):

i) f 2 > 0: closed orbits,

ii) f 2 < 0: closed orbits,
iii) f 2 = 0, ~ 6= ~0: an open orbit.
iv) f 2 = 0, ~ = ~0: a closed orbit,

since orbits i and ii can be changed to each other by inverting the sign of f 2, it is

sucient to consider orbits of type i. moreover, we do not consider the trivial orbit

of type iv. we, thus, consider the closed orbits i and the open orbit iii.

since the group action is transitive, the orbit can be written as a coset space.

namely, if we dene the complex isotropy group of the vacuum, ~v =< ~ >, as

hv = {g  gc|g  ~v = ~v},

5

(2.4)

the orbit can be written as4

m  gc/ h .

(2.5)

the representative of this coset manifold is generated by broken generators zi in
gc  h as

 = exp(i  z)  gc/ h ,

(2.6)

where i are chiral superelds, whose scalar components are the coordinate of
gc/ h.

in general, the complex isotropy group is larger than a complexication h c of

the real isotropy group,

hv = {g  g|g  ~v = ~v}.

namely, there is a point such that h can be written as

h = hc  b ,

(2.7)

(2.8)

where b is a nilpotent lie algebra, called a borel subalgebra in h. b can be
written as lower- (or upper-) half triangle matrices in a suitable basis [8]. the borel
subalgebra in h is an algebra which satises a commutation relation, [ h,b]  b.5
the complex broken generators zi can be classied to two types. one is an

hermitian generator, and the other is a non-hermitian generator. the latter has

a corresponding non-hermitian unbroken generator, bi, in the sense that two her-

mitian generators can be composed of the linear combinations of zi and bi. (here

bi need not to be an element of a borel algebra. if bi is an element of the borel

algebra, zi and bi are hermitian conjugate to each other.) the chiral superelds

i in (2.6), whose scalar components parameterize m, are also classied to two

4 here, since the isotropy group at ~v  = g0~v can be obtained by the isotropy group at ~v as

hv = g0 hg0

1, we has not written a subscript v below h.

5 therefore h can be written as a semidirect product of h c and b: h = h c  b. here the
symbol  denotes a semidirect. if there are two elements of h, hb and hb, where h, h  h c
and b, b  b, their product is dened as (hb)(hb) = hh(h1bh)b = (hh)(bb), where b =
h1bh [8, 19].

types, corresponding to broken generators. the chiral superelds, corresponding to

hermitian broken generators, are called mixed types; on the other hand, the chi-

ral superelds, corresponding to non-hermitian broken generators, are called pure

types. these names come from the fact that the mixed type includes a qng boson

besides an ng boson as a scalar component, and the pure type includes two ng

bosons without any qng boson.6

these can be illustrated as follows. as stated above, if there are non-hermitian

broken generators, zi, there exist non-hermitian unbroken generators, bi, such that
.

linear combinations of zi and bi are hermitian (broken) generators xi and xi

axi +bxi

hence, pure-type generators zi in the coset representation can be transformed to
, where a and b are some real constants, by a local h transformation from
 are hermitian, these generate

the right of the coset representative. since axi + bxi

compact directions, corresponding ng bosons. therefore, the scalar components of

a pure-type multiplet i corresponding to zi are both ng bosons.

on the other hand, since there is no unbroken partner of hermitian broken

generators, imaginary parts of scalar components of mixed-type multiplets generate

non-compact directions, corresponding to qng bosons.

in the next two subsections, we show how these two kinds of broken generators

and the borel algebra appear in the closed and open orbits, respectively.

2.2 closed orbits

closed orbits in the o(n) model are discussed in refs. [20, 22]. this subsection

is devoted to a brief review to them. the essential feature of closed orbits is a

supersymmetric vacuum alignment [28, 18, 19, 20, 22]. (especially, a geometrical

meaning of a vacuum alignment has been discussed in our previous paper [20].) by

this property, the unbroken real symmetry can change from point to point.

in closed orbits, there exists a point ~v such that h becomes a reductive group;
c; hence, there is no borel algebra [6].7 actually, there exist a gc-

hv = hv

(2.9)

where v is a constant equal to f : v2 = f 2. we call this point a symmetric point.8
the breaking pattern is g  h = o(n  1) and the broken generators are

a real coset space, g/h = o(n)/o(n  1), is generated by these generators.

namely, u
1) are ng bosons, which parameterize g/h. this manifold is a submanifold of
the full target manifold m, and m is just its complexication: m  gc/ h =
o(n)c/o(n  1)c.

the symmetric point is a special point in the full target manifold m. there exist

other vacua, transformed by gc from the symmetric point. to consider them, we

transform the vacuum by gc transformation as

k =  is a linear kahler potential, is satised [6, 3]. an iso-kahler surface, which looks like a

circle in fig. 1, touches the gc-orbit at ~v (the nearest point to the origin in fig. 1).

8 the points transformed by g from this point also satisfy the same property, and are therefore

symmetric points. it is known that the g-orbit consisting of symmetric points is unique [6]. such

the g-orbit is called d-orbit if we gauge g.

(2.12)

where  = i is a pure imaginary constant. other gc-transformations are not

independent of g0, since any vacuum can be reached from the symmetric point

by using g0 and a g-transformation. this is because the broken generators at the
symmetric point belong to a single representation, n  1, of the unbroken symmetry
h [20]. we call this vacuum the non-symmetric point. the breaking pattern of the
global symmetry is g  h  = o(n  2) and broken generators are xi and

(i = 1,   , n  2).

(2.13)

although these generators, xi

, were unbroken in the symmetric point, they generate

newly emerged ng bosons at the non-symmetric point. the number of ng bosons is
dim(g/h ) = 2n  3. it has increased more than at the symmetric point. namely,
some of qng bosons at the symmetric point have changed to ng bosons, and there

remains only one qng boson [20, 22]. the unbroken symmetry has been changed

there. this phenomenon is called supersymmetric vacuum alignment [28, 18, 19,

20, 22].

the complex broken generators are transformed as

(2.14)




except for the generator zn 1 = xn 1, most of broken generators, zi, become non-
hermitian and, thus, are pure-type generators. hence, there are np = n  2 pure-
type multiplets and the nm = 1 mixed-type multiplet. these are consistent with the

numbers of ng and qng bosons counted above. see table 1. (subscriptions, p and

m, under h-representation of the complex broken generators denote pure-types and

(2.15)




there appear non-hermitian generators bi. bi are partners of zi in a sense that,

from linear combinations of bi and zi, we can construct hermitian generators xi
. bi does not constitute a borel subalgebra, since [ h, bi]  bj is not
satised. it can be understood from the fact that there is no borel subalgebra at

and xi

the symmetric point and that gc-transformation does not change the commutation

relations.

the target spaces are same with being independent of the vacua: gc/ h 

gc/ h .

2.3 open orbit

in the last subsection, we discussed the closed orbit, characterized by f 2 > 0. there

was a supersymmetric vacuum alignment, and pure-type multiplets appeared at the

non-symmetric point. in this subsection, we discuss the open orbit characterized

by f 2 = 0 and show that there is no vacuum alignment. moreover, we nd a borel

subalgebra in the complex isotropy, dierently from the closed orbit.

10

by a gc-transformation, any vacuum on the open orbit can be transformed to

~v =





0
...
0

iv/2
v/2

,





(2.16)

where v can be taken as an arbitrary constant. the g transformation can also bring

any vacuum to this form, but v is not arbitrary. in both cases, the breaking patterns
are g  h = o(n  2). this coincidence of the breaking patterns means that
there is no vacuum alignment. the number of ng bosons is dim(g/h) = 2n  3.
besides the hermitian generators of o(n1), there are additional complex unbroken
generators. the additional unbroken generators and their broken partners are

(2.17)

here, the index i runs over 1 to n  2. they can be written as bi = xi
zi = xi

  ixi and
 are given in eqs. (2.10) and (2.13). hence, by their
. the complex

 +ixi, where xi and xi

linear combinations, we can obtain hermitian generators, xi and xi

broken generators are zi and zn 1 = xn 1. here, zi are pure-type generators
belonging to a representation n  2 of h and xn 1 is a mixed-type generator
belonging to a h-singlet. since all mixed-types are h-singlets, we can make sure

that there is no vacuum alignment in the open orbit by using the results given in

ref. [20]. we summarize these in table 2.

since bi satisfy commutation relations, [h, bi]  bj and [bi, bj]  bk, they are
elements of a borel subalgebra b in h. hence, the target space m can be written as
m  gc/ h = o(n)c/o(n  2)c  b, where b denotes a borel group. as stated
in subsec. 2.1, there exist a basis such that the borel subalgebra is represented by

lower (or upper) half o-diagonal matrices. we can thus change the basis to such a

(2.21)

where p, m, b and hc
and a semisimple part of h, namely o(n  2) part, respectively.

ss represent the pure-types, the mixed-type, the borel algebra

in the rest of paper, we argue the closed orbit in the ordinary basis, but the open

orbit in the basis changed by the unitary matrix. of course, no result depends on

the basis. we do not explicitly write u in the open orbit.

here, we give a summary of sec. 2. in general, gc-orbits can be characterized by

the values of gc-invariants. there are two types of gc-orbit: one is the closed orbit

(the orbit i in fig. 1) and the other is the open orbit (orbit iii in fig. 1). (orbit ii

is a mirror of orbit i and orbit iv is trivial.) both orbits can be written as complex
coset spaces as gc/ h = o(n)c/o(n  1)c and gc/ h = o(n)c/o(n  2)c  b,
respectively. although these two orbits are topologically dierent near to the origin,

they become close to each other at innity, as in fig. 1. especially, many properties

in the non-symmetric point on the closed orbit and generic points on the open orbit

are very similar. namely, the number of pure-type and mixed-type multiplets are

the same in both cases.

(see eqs. (2.14),(2.15) and (2.17).) moreover, their h

representations are the same in both cases. (compare the second line of table 1

and table 2.) however, there is the borel subalgebra on the open orbit, but not on

the closed orbit. in the next section we show that this dierence brings essentially

distinct results concerning to the kahler potentials on these orbits.

3 strictly g-invariant kahler potentials

in this section, we construct strictly g-invariant kahler potentials. although this

section does not have any new feature, the results are used in the next section.

hence, we briey discuss them.

13

3.1

invariants composed of fundamental elds

in the o(n)-model, there exist one g-invariant comprising fundamental elds: ~~.

this parameterizes a moduli space of global symmetry [20]. (we do not discuss this

feature.) since this is strictly g-invariant, a low-energy eective kahler potential

can be written as an arbitrary function of this quantity. we showed, in a previous

paper [20], that this is just the a-type invariant of bkmu [9, 8].

there is a relation between the fundamental elds and the coset representative

of gc/ h,

~ = ~v|f ,

(3.1)

where f denotes the f-term constraint, ~2 = f 2. from this equation, the kahler

potential can be written as

ka = f (~~)|2=f 2 = f (~v~v) .

(3.2)

this form does not depend on whether the orbit is closed, f 2 > 0, or open, f 2 = 0.

3.2

invariants constructed by using projections

other strictly g-invariants, called as the c-type, were found by bkmu [8].9 we

review it here.

consider projection matrices i, which project v onto h-invariant subspaces

iv . these satisfy projection conditions,

we construct quantities

g gpig. thus, quantities tr (pipj), tr (pipjpk),   , are strictly

9 it is not known whether these invariants can be written in fundamental elds.

14

g-invariant.10 hence, a kahler potential can be written as an arbitrary function of

them:

kc = f (tr (pipj),  ) (i 6= j etc., iv / jv etc.).

(3.5)

we next apply this to the o(n) model. projections  are dierent between in

the closed orbit and in the open orbit. we rst consider the closed orbit. at the

symmetric point, we can nd two projections,11

(3.6)

hence, there is one c-type invariant on the closed orbit:

kc = f (tr (p1p2)) .

(3.7)

of course, the most general strictly g-invariant kahler potential is an arbitrary

function of both the a- and c-type invariants.

in the open orbit, h is the form of

the values of the c-type invariants are constant on each g-orbit as the a-type

invariants. but we do not know whether they can be constructed by the fundamental

elds and whether they have a geometric meaning, such as the moduli space of global

symmetry in the case of a-types. we do not investigate these aspects in this paper,

and concentrate on the b-type invariants.

section we discuss kahler potentials g-invariant up to a kahler transformation.

b-type kahler potentials are strictly g-invariant and are not independent of a-

or c-type invariants [8]. in the o(n) model, this is the case and b-type kahler

potentials are strictly g-invariant. nevertheless, in this section we show that if and
only if the orbit is open, does the kahler manifold, gc/ h, have a compact kahler
submanifold, gc/ h, and b-type kahler potentials on gc/ h reduce to those on
gc/ h, which is g-invariant up to a kahler transformation.

also satises the projection condition. however, from a relation v  v ,

we can not construct c-type invariants. in the case of b-types, which is discussed in the next

section, b-type kahler potentials constructed by using  and  are not independent as in the case

of pure realizations [10]. see the footnote 15 in app. a. therefore, we do not need .

16

4.1 closed orbits

in this subsection, we consider the closed orbit. by using  projections in eq. (3.6),

b-type kahler potentials can be constructed as [8, 10]

kbi = log deti ,

(4.1)

where deti denotes a determinant in the i projected matrix.13 since there is no
center in h, they are strictly g-invariant, contrary to the pure realization cases [8,

10]. actually,

v1 = det1 = ~v~v/|~v|2

(4.2)

is not independent of the a-type invariant obtained in the last section. moreover,

kb2 is also expected not to be independent of the c-type invariant. (but we do not

calculate an explicit form.) although the b-types are strictly g-invariant and are

not independent of the a- or c-type invariants, we investigate these in more detail.

first we consider the case at the symmetric point. since all broken generators

are mixed-type and there is no pure-type multiplet, one can nd no compact sub-

manifold, which, if any, would be parameterized by pure-type multiplets. moreover,
all broken generators belong to one representation, n  1 of h = o(n  1). there-
fore, it is impossible to nd any submanifold where some of the broken generators

are changed to unbroken generators.

secondly, we consider the non-symmetric points. at the non-symmetric points,
the supersymmetric vacuum alignment occurs, and there appear n  2 pure-type
multiplets and one mixed-type multiplet. the pure-type multiplets belong to n  2
representation of h  = o(n  2); on the other hand, the mixed-type multiplet is a
singlet. therefore, one may consider that there is a compact submanifold, but we

show that this is not true.

13 since, under a g  g transformation, the coset representative, , is transformed as 
gh1, where h  h, kbi is transformed as kbi
we have used the projection conditions (3.3). last two terms are changed to space-time total

 kbi + log deti

h1 + log deti

derivatives by the superspace integral. this can be understood as a kahler transformation.

17

if there would be a compact submanifold, only one possibility is that it were a

manifold parameterized by pure-type multiplets without one mixed-type multiplet.

we, thus, change the mixed-type broken generator q

def

= xn 1 to an unbroken

generator and dene new unbroken and broken generators as

h = {hss, bi, q}, gc  h = {zi} ,

(4.3)

where hss is a lie algebra of h  = o(n  2) and zi and bi are given in eqs. (2.14)
and (2.15). since q commutes with hss, it is a center in {hss, q}. but, commutation
relations of q with zi and bi are

[q, zi] = ibi, [q, bi] = izi.

(4.4)

note that zi and bi do not carry denite charges of q. moreover, h can not
constitute a closed algebra. thus, the submanifold gc/ h can not be considered

to be a coset space; but, since we can dene it by using broken generators zi, we
continue the argument. the relation of coset representative  of gc/ h  and the
corresponding quantity (but not coset representative)  of gc/ h is

 = exp(i   z + iq)  gc/ h 

= exp(i  z) exp(iq)h1
=  exp(iq)h1

(4.5)

def

= exp(i  z) parameterize gc/ h. here, h  h is needed, since
where i in 
the commutation relations of zi and q include unbroken generators bi  h as
1 on gc/ h  would satisfy  h = h, they
eq. (4.4). if projections 
could be considered as also being projections on gc/ h, and the kahler potentials
(4.1) could reduce to kahler potentials on gc/ h. but, unfortunately, they do not
satisfy the projection conditions on gc/ h, eq. (a.6). we, thus, conclude that
kahler potentials (4.1) on gc/ h do not reduce to those on gc/ h. in fact, the

i = g0ig0

above argument at the non-symmetric points could be concluded by the arguments

at the symmetric point: even if the b-types reduced to those on any compact

submanifold at the non-symmetric point, they could not connect to the symmetric

point smoothly by any gc-transformation.

18

in the case of the closed orbit, we do not need b-type invariants, since they are

not independent of a- or c-type invariants. in the next section we show that this

feature is quite dierent in the open orbit.

4.2 open orbit

in the open orbit, there is no vacuum alignment. there are n  1 pure-type gener-
ators and one mixed-type generator. to consider a compact submanifold, as is done

in the closed orbit, we change the mixed-type broken generator, q = xn 1, to an

unbroken generator. new unbroken and broken generators are

h = {hss, bi, q}, gc  h = {zi} ,

(4.6)

where zi and bi are given in eq. (2.17). although hss and q are the same as in the
closed-orbit case and q is a center in {hss, q}, non-hermitian broken and unbroken
generators, zi and bi, are dierent from the closed orbit. namely, commutation

relations between, zi and bi, and qi are

[q, zi] = zi, [q, bi] = bi .

(4.7)

compare these equations with eq. (4.4). dierent from the closed-orbit case, zi
and bi carry denite charges this time. from the second equation, h becomes an
algebra and gc/ h = o(n)c/o(n  2)c  u(1)c  b  o(n)/o(n  2)  u(1),
where b denotes the borel group, is a coset space. since we obtain [ h, bi]  bj,
bi constitute a borel subalgebra not only in h, but also in h. by using the rst
equation of (4.7) and [zi, zj]  zk, the relation between the coset representative  of
gc/ h and the one  of compact homogeneous submanifold gc/ h can be obtained

as

 = exp(i   z + iq)  gc/ h

= exp(i  z) exp(iq)
=  exp(iq) .

(4.8)

the coordinate transformation  = (, ) can be calculated by using the baker-

campbell-hausdor formula, but we do not need an explicit representation. if we

19

dene

v = det,

(4.9)

it is strictly g-invariant, since it is not independent of a-type invariant, ka, con-
structed in the last section: v = ~v~v/|~v|2. therefore a b-type kahler potential,

kb = c log v = c log det,

(4.10)

where c is a real constant, is also strictly g-invariant. this situation is the same
as closed orbits. however, in this case, the  projection on gc/ h also satises
the projection conditions on the submanifold gc/ h, eq. (a.6). hence, by using

eq. (4.8), v can be calculated as

v = det = det ()

= det [ exp(iq)  exp(iq)]
= det [ exp(iq)  exp(iq)]
= det [( exp(iq))( )( exp(iq))]
= u exp[i(  )]

(4.11)

def

where u

= det  is a corresponding quantity in gc/ h. here, we have used the
projection condition (a.6) in the third line and a formula, log deta = tr ( log a),
and tr (q) = 1 in the fourth line. from this equation, the kahler potential can
be calculated as

kb = c log u + ic(  ) .

(4.12)

the last term changes to the space-time total derivative by the superspace integral
and kb reduces to a kahler potential kb0 of the compact submanifold gc/ h,

kb0 = c log u = c log det  = c log(cid:18)1 + ||2 +

1
4

22(cid:19) .

(4.13)

the last explicit form is calculated in app. a. note that, although kb is strictly g-
invariant, kb0 is g-invariant up to a kahler transformation. gc/ h is parameterized

by scalar parts of pure-type multiplets without any mixed-type multiplet. this

20

realization is called a pure realization. hence, we conclude that the pure realization

is embedded in the open orbit, but not in the closed orbit.

in the open orbit, the most general eective kahler potential can be written as

a sum of the b-type kahler potential, kb0 in eq. (4.13), on a compact submanifold
gc/ h  o(n)/o(n  2)  u(1), and an arbitrary function of strictly g-invariant,
ka in eq. (3.2). of course, if we choose the arbitrary function as f (x) = c log x in

the latter, it becomes a sum of the former and the space-time total derivative. in

this sense, the former can be included in the latter.

before closing this section, we discuss a relation with the broken center models

considered by buchmuller and ellwanger [14, 15, 16]. the pure realizations have
the compact homogeneous target manifold gc/ h. in compact homogeneous kahler
manifolds, there exist a homeomorphism gc/ h  g/h = g/hss  u(1)n. here,
hss is a semisimple subgroup of h or h, and there are n centers in h or h. the

kahler potential is written as a sum of n b-type kahler potentials [10]. buchmuller
and ellwanger [14] have considered models where m( n) centers in h are broken
it was shown that m linear combinations of b-
by hand from pure realizations.

type kahler potentials are strictly g-invariant and that the kahler potential can

be written as a sum of n b-type kahler potentials and an arbitrary function of

m strictly g-invariants. since these models are not pure realizations, they were

expected to have linear model origins. however, it was not known whether they

have linear model origins.

in the open orbit, we have shown that if one center in h is unbroken by hand,
it reduces to the compact homogeneous manifold o(n)/o(n  2) u(1). this can
be considered as being an inverting procedure of buchmuller and ellwanger. we,

thus, have been able to nd that special case (the case when one center is broken:

n = m = 1) of the broken-center models has an open orbit as a linear-model origin.

a question as to whether the general cases of broken center models have linear model

origins is discussed in the next section.

21

5 conclusions and discussions

the target spaces of the nonlinear sigma models, which have linear model origins,

are obtained as gc-orbits of the vacuum. in the o(n) model, there are closed orbits

and an open orbit, depending on the value of the gc-invariant. (they are the orbit

i and iii in fig. 1.) both kinds of orbits can be written as complex coset spaces:
gc/ h = o(n)c/o(n  1)c and gc/ h = o(n)c/o(n  2)c  b respectively. on
the closed orbits, the vacuum alignment occurs (as table 1), and the numbers of

ng and qng bosons change, with the total number remain unchanged, at various

vacua. these two orbits are similar, except near to the origin, as in fig. 1. actually,

the numbers of the pure-type multiplets and the mixed-type multiplets are the same

at the non-symmetric points of the closed orbit and the generic points on the open

orbit. (see second line of table 1 and table 2.) however, we have shown that, in

the open orbit, the non-hermitian unbroken generators, bi in eqs. (2.17) or (2.20),
constitute a borel subalgebra in the complex isotropy h, but in the closed orbit, bi
in eq. (2.15) do not constitute it. this dierence plays a crucial role on the both

orbits.

in the nonlinear realization with a linear model origin, the b-type kahler poten-

tials are strictly g-invariant and are not independent of a- or c-type invariants. to

nd a compact kahler manifold as a submanifold, we have changed the mixed-type

generator, q = xn 1, to an unbroken generator by hand in both orbits.

in the

closed orbit, zi and bi does not carry denite charges of q as eq. (4.4); on the

other hand, in the open orbit, zi and bi carry denite opposite charges of q as

eq. (4.7). moreover, in the closed orbit, the -projection on the full manifold does

not satisfy the perojection conditions (a.6) on the compact submanifold; on the

other hand, in the open orbit, it does satisfy the perojection conditions on the com-

pact submanifold. we, thus, have found that any compact manifold is not embedded

in the closed orbit, but it is embedded in the open orbit. from these dierences,

we have showed that the b-type kahler potentials of the closed orbit are still just

strictly g-invariant, and, on the other hand, that the b-type kahler potential on

the open orbit reduces to one of the compact homogeneous kahler submanifold,

22

gc/ h = o(n)c/o(n  2)c  u(1)c  b  o(n)/o(n  2) u(1), whose kahler
potential is g-invariant up to a kahler transformation.

it was known that a kahler potential of a compact kahler manifold can be

written as a sum of b-type kahler potentials. we may strengthen this property:

it seems that even when the target manifold is non-compact, the b-type kahler

potentials can essentially live on compact kahler manifolds (embedded in the target

space). we can also say that b-type kahler potentials can automatically nd a

compact homogeneous kahler manifold as a submanifold in the full target manifold.

here we have discussions. these results can be generalized to more general mod-

els. first, we discuss closed orbits. it is known that a closed orbit has a symmetric
point, such that a equation h = h c is established. the maximal realization occurs

at the symmetric point, there is no pure-type multiplet and one can not nd any

compact submanifold. moreover, some mixed-type multiplets belong to non-singlet

of h; hence, a combination with our previous results [20] leads to a supersymmet-

ric vacuum alignment. the pure-type generators which arise by vacuum alignment

are all non-borelian, since the gc-transformation does not change the commutation

relations. we, thus, can conclude that, on the closed orbits, there is no kahler

potential g-invariant up to a kahler transformation.

secondly, we discuss the open orbits. we do not know whether the open orbits

have a vacuum alignment. however it does not seem that open orbits have a vacuum

alignment, based on some examples (the open orbit of the o(n) model in this paper

and u(n) with n in the previous paper [20]). if this is true, all pure-type generators
constitute a borel subalgebra in h. since there is no vacuum alignment, from our
previous results [20], it can be concluded that all mixed-type generators are h-

singlets. (let its number to be n.) hence, if we change these mixed-type generators

to be unbroken, non-hermitian unbroken generators constitute a borel subalgebra in
a complex isotropy which includes a complexication of hss  u(1)n. (from now on
we write h as hss.) but, to nd a compact homogeneous manifold, we must change

some o-diagonal charged broken generators to be unbroken. (this will show that

there is no linear-model origin of the broken-center models considered by buchmuller

and ellwanger [14, 15, 16], except f or the case where one center is broken, considered

23

in this paper.) this brings an arbitrariness of a choice of h, with hss  u(1)n being
xed. this is just a choice of a g-invariant complex structure [10, 11, 12]. namely,
any compact homogeneous kahler submanifold, gc/ h  g/hss  u(1)n (n  2),
have such the arbitrariness [10, 11, 12]. hence, it seems that we must add b-type

kahler potentials of all compact kahler submanifolds (even same real manifolds,
gc/ h  g/hss  u(1)n, with dierent invariant complex structures) to its kahler
potential. we can show that they correspond to the choices of  projections on
gc/ h. these aspects will be reported in the near future [29].

finally, we give some comments concerning to applications. since we show that

a pure realization is embedded in the open orbit, we can apply this phenomenon to

seeking linear-model origins of pure realizations [10][13] by introducing a proper

gauging. we hope that such investigation reaches to linear origins of the coset

unication models [4].

since open orbits have pure-type multiplets anywhere, namely there exist no
point such that h = h c can be established and that a maximal realization can

occur. hence, if we gauge g, there is no point such that vector multiplets can

get mass supersymmetrically by the supersymmetric higgs mechanism. this brings

about a spontaneous breaking of supersymmetry [23, 27, 31]. these phenomena

may be applied to dynamical supersymmetry breaking [2, 30].

itoh, kugo and kunitomo have given the method to construct a kahler potential
of an arbitrary compact homogeneous kahler manifold, gc/ h  g/h [10]. in this
