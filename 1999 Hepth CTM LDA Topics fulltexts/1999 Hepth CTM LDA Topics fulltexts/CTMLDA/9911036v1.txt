i. introduction

in the past few years a large amount of eorts has been devoted to two-dimensional gauge

theories (y m2), mainly motivated by the possibility of exact solutions which are believed

to share features with the real four-dimensional world.

although y m2 seems trivial when quantized in the light-cone gauge, still topological

degrees of freedom occur if the theory is put on a (partially or totally) compact manifold,

whereas the simpler behaviour enforced by the light-cone gauge condition on the plane entails

a severe worsening in its infrared structure. one can say that, in light-cone gauge, dynamics

gets hidden in the very singular nature of correlators at large distances (ir singularities).

the rst quantity that comes to mind is the two-point correlator.

if the theory is

quantized in the gauge a = 0 at equal-times, the free propagator has the following causal

expression (wml prescription) in two dimensions

dw m l

++ (x) =

1
2

x

x+ + ix ,

x =

x0  x1

,

(1)

rst proposed by t.t. wu [1].

in turn this propagator is nothing but the restriction in

two dimensions of the expression proposed by s. mandelstam and g. leibbrandt [2] in four

dimensions and derived by means of a canonical quantization in ref. [3].

in dimensions higher than two, where physical degrees of freedom are switched on

(transverse gluons), causality is mandatory in order to get correct analyticity proper-

ties, which in turn are the basis of any consistent renormalization program, and to obtain

agreement with feynman gauge results [4].

the situation is somewhat dierent in exactly two dimensions. here the theory can

be quantized on the light-front (at equal x+); with such a choice, no dynamical degrees of

freedom occur as the non-vanishing component of the vector eld does not propagate

but rather gives rise to an instantaneous (in x+) coulomb-like potential.

a formulation based essentially on the potential in eq. (2) was originally proposed by g.

t hooft in 1974 [5], to derive beautiful solutions for the q q-bound state problem under the

form of rising regge trajectories. on the other hand, when wus prescription is adopted,

the bound state equation at large-n turns out to be very dicult, and regge trajectories

disappear. a suitable tool to clarify the origin of this discrepancy is the wilson loop, owing

to its gauge invariance and to its reasonable infrared properties.

ii. wilson loop on the plane

when inserted in perturbative wilson loop calculations, expressions eqs. (1) and (2)

lead to completely dierent results. in two dimensions pure-area exponentiation is expected.

this is due to the invariance of the theory under area-preserving dieomorphisms, which
suggests that the wilson loop is a function of the dimensionless quantity g2a, with a the
encircled area, and to unitary evolution.

if a rectangle with light-like sides is chosen as a contour, with t hooft potential only

planar diagrams can be built, for any value of n. therefore the perturbative series is easily

resummed leading to the expected result 1

w [a] = exp(cid:18)

2

cf g2a(cid:19) ,

(3)

n

where cf is the quadratic casimir operator for the fundamental representation, i.e. n 21
2n ,
2 for su(n), u(n), respectively. connement holds and, in the t hooft limit n  ,
g2n xed, eq. (3) exhibits a nite string tension.

when the propagator is endowed with the causal prescription eq. (1), instead, disagree-
ment with the result eq. (3) already shows up at order o(g4), and is due to graphs with
crossed vector propagators which produce a contribution proportional to cf ca, ca being

the casimir of the adjoint representation. although non-trivial, resummation of the pertur-

bative series at all orders in the coupling constant g is still possible. this was performed

1in the euclidean formulation

3

in [6]: once a circular contour is chosen, geometry factorizes out and the task of determining

the wilson loop reduces to the purely combinatorial problem of nding the group factors

corresponding to the wick contractions. fortunately these factors are generated by a matrix

integral in the space of hermitian (traceless) n  n matrices for u(n) (su(n)). the result
for u(n) reads

w =

1
n

exp(cid:20)

g2a
4 (cid:21) l(1)

n 1(g2a/2) ,

(4)

the function l(1)

n 1 being a generalized laguerre polynomial. in addition to the extra poly-

nomial appearing in eq. (4), the string tension turns out to be dierent from the one in

eq. (3). more dramatically, eq. (4) in the t hooft limit becomes

where g2 = g2 n, and connement is lost, thereby explaining the failure of wus spectrum.

(5)

we are now standing before two dierent scenarios and there is apparently no motivation

to prefer one to the other, since both t hoofts and wus results are analytic in g2. the

need for reconciliation becomes urgent.

iii. the instanton expansion

in order to gain a deeper insight, it is worthwhile to study the problem on a compact

two-dimensional manifold [7]. let it be the sphere for simplicity. therein the procedure

is purely geometrical and group-theoretical, so that no gauge-xing has to be adopted and

infra-red problems are absent.

the starting point are the well-known expressions [8] of the exact partition function and

of a wilson loop for a pure u(n) yang-mills theory on a sphere s2 with area a

w(a  a,a) =

z(a) =xr

dr (s) being the dimension of the irreducible representation r(s) of u(n); c2(r) (c2(s)) is

the quadratic casimir, aa,a are the areas singled out by the loop, the integral in eq. (7)
is over the u(n) group manifold and r(s) is the character of the group element u in the

r (s) representation. in order to evaluate w(aa,a) in the decompactication limit, for
n > 1 eqs. (6), (7) can be explicitly written in the form

z(a) =

in the previous formulae the generic irreducible representation has been described by means

of the set of integers mi = (m1, ..., mn ), related to the young tableaux, in terms of which

one gets

 is the vandermonde determinant and the integration in eq. (7) has been performed

explicitly, using the well-known formula for the characters in terms of the set mi.

now, as rst noted by witten [9], it is possible to represent z(a) and consequently
w(aa,a) as a sum over instable instantons, each instanton contribution being associ-
ated to a nite, non-trivial, perturbative expansion. one can observe that in the sum over
{mi} the dependence on the area is through the dimensionless quantity g2a, whereas an
instanton action typically depends on 1
g2a . therefore a duality transformation is required to

turn the fraction upside down. the mathematical tool to carry out such a task is provided

by a poisson resummation [10] over {mi}

when performed in eqs. (8), (9), it gives

(11)

(12)

(13)

finally, sinst(ni) is interpreted as an instanton action 2, while z(n1, ..., nn ) and

wk(n1, ..., nn ) are the quantum corrections around the classical solutions [11].

from the above representations it is rather clear why the decompactication limit a  
should not be performed too early. as a matter of fact, on the plane uctuations around

the instanton solutions are undistinguishable from gaussian uctuations around the trivial

eld conguration, since sinst(ni) goes to zero for any nite set ni when a  . for nite
a and nite ni instead, in the limit g  0, only the zero-instanton sector can survive in the
wilson loop expression.

iv. relation with perturbation theory

in principle the zero-instanton contribution should be obtainable by means of perturba-

tive calculations. if in eqs. (12), (13) only the zero-instanton sector, i.e. ni = 0, is retained,

2indeed, on s2 there are non-trivial solutions of the yang-mills equation, labelled by the set of

integers {ni} = (n1, . . . , nn ) (see [11]).

6

after some technicalities the following result is found [11]

w (0) =

1
n

exp(cid:20)g2a(a  a)

4a

(cid:21) l1

n 1(cid:18)g2a(a  a)

2a

(cid:19) .

(14)

at this point a remark is in order:

in the decompactication limit a  , a xed, the
quantity in the equation above exactly coincides, for any value of n, with eq. (4), which

was derived from a matrix model. hence, the zero-instanton contribution corresponds in a

sense to integrating over the group algebra.

v. the wilson loop with winding number n

disagreement of eq. (14) with the pure-area exponentiation is at this stage no longer
surprising since w (0) does not contain any genuine non-perturbative contribution, viz in-
stantons. for any value of n the pure-area exponentiation follows, after decompactication,

from resummation of all instanton sectors, changing completely the zero-sector behaviour

and, in particular, the value of the string tension.

what might instead be unexpected in this context is the fact that, using the instanta-

neous t hooft potential and just resumming at all orders the related perturbative series,

one still ends up with the correct pure-area exponentiation.

this is true also in more general instances, such as wilson loops winding n times on a

closed contour [12]. for a pure u(n) yang-mills theory on a sphere s2 with area a it holds

wn(a  a,a) =

1

dr ds exp(cid:20)
zn xr,s
z dutr[u n]r(u)

s(u),

g2(a  a)

4

c2(r) 

g2a
4

c2(s)(cid:21)

(15)

the notation being as in eq. (7).

it can be shown that in the decompactication limit

a  , a xed, the following expression is recovered
n(n + n  1)(cid:21) +
xk=0
 exp(cid:20)g2a
n k(cid:21) .

wn(a; n) =

the series is actually a nite sum, stopping at k = n  1 or k = n  1, depending on the
smaller one. as happened for n = 1, eq. (16) is expected to come out from the resummation

of t hooft perturbative series, that corresponds to a light-front quantization of the theory.

some comments are now in order. first of all notice that when n > 1 the simple abelian-like

exponentiation is lost. in other words the theory starts to feel its non-abelian nature and the

combinatorial coecients in eq. (16) signal that the light-front vacuum, though simpler than

its analog in the equal-time quantization, cannot be considered trivial. actually, from the

sphere point of view, eq. (16) can be understood as coming from an instantons resummation.

the procedure to see this is exactly the one outlined above for the case n = 1. on the other

hand to neglect instantons, and then to send the area of the sphere to innity, is likely to

reproduce the wml computation. in fact the perturbative analysis have conrmed these

claims. furthermore, eq. (16) exhibits an intriguing duality

wn(a; n) = wn(cid:16) n

n a; n(cid:17) ,

(17)

a relation that is far from being trivial, involving an unexpected interplay between the

geometrical and the algebraic structure of the theory. looking at eq. (17), the abelian-

like exponentiation for u(n) when n = 1 appears to be connected to the u(1) loop with

n windings, the genuine triviality of maxwell theory providing the expected behaviour

for the string tension. finally, one should observe that the large-n limit (with n xed) is

equivalent to the limit in which an innite number of windings is considered with vanishing

rescaled loop area. alternatively, this rescaling could be thought to aect the coupling
constant g2  n
n g2. in detail, the former limit (n  , g2 = g2n xed) coincides with
the kazakov-kostov result [13]

wn(a;) =

1
n

g2a n

4

(cid:21) .

(18)

l(1)

n1(cid:0)g2a n/2(cid:1) exp(cid:20)

next, using eq. (17) one is able to perform the latter limit, namely n   with xed n2 a

lim
nwn(a; n) =

1
n

l(1)

n 1(cid:0)g2a n2/2(cid:1) exp(cid:20)

g2a n2

4

(cid:21) .

(19)

eq. (19) turns out to be exactly the zero-instanton contribution w (0)
in wn(aa,a) after
decompactication [12]. such a coincidence can be explained by observing that, having the

n

instantons a nite size, small loops are essentially blind to them. again, this is not the end

of the story: as expected, eq. (19) can be derived through resummation of the perturbative

series dened via wml prescription (matrix model).

the conclusion to be drawn is that the interpretation of both the equal-time and the

light-front vacua in the case of a simple wilson loop can be extended to the more general

case of a loop with winding number n.

in the light of the considerations above, wml,

even resummed, appears to be truly perturbative since it provides only the expression of
the zero-instanton contribution to wilson loops w (0). as opposed to this, t hooft is non-
perturbative, in the sense that a perturbative series in a static potential reproduces

a complex instanton expansion. this seems to be the case also for loops in the adjoint

representation with non trivial -vacua (when the theory is based on the group su(n)/zn).
again w (0) corresponds to a matrix model after decompactication and is insensitive to the
choice of the vacuum sector. this will be the subject of a forthcoming publication.
