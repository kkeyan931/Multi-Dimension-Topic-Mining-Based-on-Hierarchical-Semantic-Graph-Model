abstract

in this paper we develop an irreducible antield brst-anti-brst

formalism for reducible gauge theories.

pacs number: 11.10.ef

1 introduction

the most powerful manifestly covariant quantization method for gauge theo-
ries was proved to be the antield brst formalism [1][5]. an other approach
of the same kind is represented by the antield brst-anti-brst formalism.
the brst-anti-brst method was dierently implemented at the hamilto-
nian [6][10] and lagrangian [10][23] levels. although it does not play such
an important role like the brst symmetry itself, the brst-anti-brst for-
mulation is a helpful background for the geometrical (supereld) description
of the brst transformation, the investigation of the perturbative renormal-
izability of the yang-mills models, a consistent approach of anomalies, as well
as for the correct understanding of the non-minimal sector involved with the
brst quantization [24][30]. the antield brst-anti-brst symmetry can

be implemented in the context of irreducible, as well as of reducible gauge
theories. however, in the reducible case the brst-anti-brst ghost and
antield spectra are more involved precisely due to the fact that the gauge
generators are no longer independent. in view of this, the derivation of the
solution to the master equation corresponding to the reducible case is more
dicult than in the irreducible one.

this paper investigates the possibility of quantizing reducible gauge the-
ories by employing the brst-anti-brst prescriptions for irreducible sys-
tems. our main result consists in proving that a large class of reducible
gauge systems can be covariantly quantized accordingly the irreducible anti-
eld brst-anti-brst manner. our treatment is based on the fact that the
antield brst-anti-brst symmetry for a given gauge theory exists sim-
ply provided that the corresponding antield brst symmetry exists.
in
this light, we enforce the following steps: (i) we transform the initial re-
ducible gauge theory into an irreducible one in a manner that allows the
replacement of the brst quantization of the reducible system by that of the
irreducible theory, and (ii) we quantize the irreducible gauge theory within
the antield brst-anti-brst framework. step (i) results in the possibil-
ity to derive an irreducible brst symmetry associated with the reducible
theory. this makes legitimate the application of the irreducible antield
brst-anti-brst machinery to the irreducible theory associated with the
original reducible system.

our paper is organized in ve sections. section 2 realizes a brief review on
the main ingredients of the irreducible antield brst-anti-brst construc-
tion. in section 3 we derive an irreducible theory associated with the starting
reducible one and show that it is permissible from the brst point of view
to replace the quantization of the reducible system by that of the irreducible
theory. we subsequently develop the antield brst-anti-brst quantiza-
tion of the irreducible theory associated with the reducible system. section
4 illustrates the theoretical part of the paper for the freedman-townsend
model and for a model with abelian three-form gauge elds. section 5 ends
the paper with some conclusions.

2 main ideas of the irreducible antield brst-

anti-brst construction

in this section we present a summary of basic elements required at the con-
struction of the brst-anti-brst symmetry corresponding to an irreducible
gauge theory. we start from an arbitrary action (local functional) depending
on the elds i

sl

0 hii = z ddxl(cid:16)i(x), 1i(x),    , 1    si(x)(cid:17) ,

(1)

which is assumed invariant under the gauge transformations (written in the
de witt condensed notations)

i = ri

 (cid:18) i(x) = z ddyri

(x, y)(y)(cid:19) .

(2)

for deniteness we consider the bosonic case, but the analysis can be straight-
forwardly extended to fermions modulo introducing some appropriate phases.
we suppose that ri
 form an irreducible generating set, i.e., these functions
are independent and complete. the completeness of the gauge generators
induces that

 may involve the elds, and the weak equality  means an

the fundamental scope of the antield brst-anti-brst formalism is to

construct two dierentials dening an algebra of the type

1 = 0 = s2
s2

2, s1s2 + s2s1 = 0,

(4)

where s1 and s2 are respectively called the brst and anti-brst operators,
and must be such their cohomology at degree zero is given by the classical
observables of (1) (gauge invariant functions dened on the stationary surface
of eld equations  : sl
i = 0). from (4) and the zeroth order cohomological
requirement it is clear that

0

s = s1 + s2,

(5)

is also nilpotent, and, moreover, describes a brst symmetry associated with
a redundant description of the gauge symmetries inferred by duplicating the

3

gauge generators. conversely, any such redundant brst symmetry of (1)
that splits like in (5) implies the brst-anti-brst algebra (4) for its separate
pieces plus the isomorphism between the zero degree cohomologies of the
individual parts and the classical observables of (1). these two aspects lead
to the fact that one can replace (4) by the unique relation

s2 = 0,

(6)

provided s can be made to split as in (5). in other words, one can simply
follow the standard brst rules for rst-stage reducible gauge systems in
order to construct s (and therefore s1 and s2, once the split is shown to
hold). in order to handle appropriately the two pieces of s it is necessary to
introduce a bidegree that distangles between them. it is called ghost bidegree
or bighost number, is denoted by bigh = (gh1, gh2), and is dened through

bigh(s1) = (1, 0) , bigh(s2) = (0, 1),

(7)

such that the resulting degree, called ghost number and denoted by gh, will
be gh = gh1 + gh2.

in order to perform a proper construction of s (and consequently of s1 and
 and to introduce

s2), it is necessary to duplicate the gauge generators ri
the corresponding reducibility functions

following the standard brst receipt, the ghost spectrum will contain the
ghosts

the new gauge generators (ri
) and the reducibility functions (8).the
bighost number and grassmann parity () of the original elds and ghost
spectrum variables are dened by setting

it is well-known that in the standard brst formalism there is one an-
tibracket with ghost number one. here it is necessary to construct two an-
tibrackets in order to make the antibracket structure compatible with the
ghost bidegrees of the ghost spectrum while preserving the symmetry be-
tween the two degrees gh1 and gh2. we denote the two antibrackets by (, )1
and (, )2 requiring that they possess the bighost number (1, 0), respectively,
(0, 1), and introduce a pair of antields ((1)
a ) respectively conjugated
to a eld a in the rst and second antibracket. the characteristics of the
antields are as follows

a , (2)

bigh(cid:16)(1)

a (cid:17) = (cid:16)gh1(a)  1, gh2(a)(cid:17) ,

a (cid:17) = (cid:16)gh1(a), gh2(a)  1(cid:17) ,
a (cid:17) = (cid:16)(2)
a (cid:17) = (a) + 1 mod 2,

and the fundamental antibrackets are dened by

(17)

(18)

(cid:16)a, (1)
b (cid:17)1

= (cid:16)a, (2)
b (cid:17)2

= a

b,(cid:16)a, (1)
b (cid:17)2

= (cid:16)a, (2)
b (cid:17)1

= 0.

(19)

however, there appear two problems with the denition of the koszul-tate
operator along the standard line of the antield procedure, namely, it fails to
be nilpotent and there are non trivial co-cycles at positive resolution degrees.
these matters are due in principle to the fact that at the lagrangian level the
duplication of the gauge symmetries is not accompanied by a duplication of
the eld equations dening the stationary surface. therefore, the complete
reducible description of gauge orbits does not dene a complete redundant
description of the stationary surface. these points prevent the direct con-
struction of a koszul-tate dierential  that splits into two pieces generating
a biresolution of c () in the usual manner. the diculties mentioned
above can be surpassed by adding further variables a called bar variables,
with the features

bigh(cid:16) a(cid:17) = (cid:16)gh1a  1, gh2a  1(cid:17) , (cid:16) a(cid:17) = (a),

(20)

and by modifying the action of  as the sum between a canonical (brst-like
component) can and a non-canonical part expressed via an operator v that
acts (only on the bar variables) through

under these considerations, the total koszul-tate dierential splits as  =
1 + 2, with bigh(1) = (1, 0), bigh(2) = (0, 1), the concrete actions of the
two koszul-tate components being deduced on account of identifying the
expressions from (2631) with respect to the resolution bidegree (also called
antighost bidegree or biantighost number). the prior denitions restore both
the nilpotency and the acyclicity of  at positive resolution degrees, and,
moreover, induce the required relations

2
1 = 0 = 2

2, 12 + 21 = 0.

(32)

in addition, it is easy to check that while  realizes a resolution of the alge-
bra c (), (1, 2) perform a biresolution of the same algebra. the resolu-
tion bidegree bires = (res1, res2) of the brst and anti-brst koszul-tate
components are expressed as expected by bires(1) = (1, 0), bires(2) =
(0, 1), while the resolution degree of an object with the resolution bidegree

7

(res1, res2) is obtained via res = res1 + res2. the resolution bidegrees of all
the elds are (0, 0), and those of the antields (2325) can be computed by

bires  (gh1,gh2)

antield! = (gh1, gh2). now, it is easy to see that 1 and 2 can

be decomposed like  in (22), i.e.,

1 = 1can + v1, 2 = 2can + v2,

(33)

with bires(1can) = (1, 0) = bires(v1), bires(2can) = (0, 1) = bires(v2),
where

in the standard antield approach the implementation of the brst sym-
metry is accomplished by means of a ghost number zero bosonic anticanonical
generator that is the solution of the master equation and leads to the eec-
tive action. in the antield brst-anti-brst approach there is also a single
bosonic generator s of ghost bidegree (0, 0) (and thus of ghost number zero)
that implements this symmetry through

sf = (f, s) + v f,

(35)

for any f depending on the elds and antields, where the antibracket (, )
is dened by

(, ) = (, )1 + (, )2 .

(36)

the nilpotency of s implies at the antibracket level the classical master equa-
tion of the brst-anti-brst formalism

and to the properties (s) = 0, bigh(s) = (0, 0). actually, it was shown
[10] that the solution to the master equation (37) satisfying the required

8

conditions exists, which further yields that we can decompose s precisely
into two pieces s1 and s2 of ghosts bidegrees (7) that act like

saf = (f, s)a + vaf, a = 1, 2,

(40)

where (, )a and va are dened by (19) and (34). the master equation (37) is
in fact equivalent with two equations, namely,

(s, s)1 + v1s = 0,

(s, s)2 + v2s = 0.

however, the results obtained are not entirely convenient as the generator of
the lagrangian brst-anti-brst symmetry is neither brst, nor anti-brst
invariant. this matter will be solved within the gauge-xing process.

in order to appropriately x the gauge, it is necessary to forget for the
moment about the second antibracket, and to add some new elds in the

3 irreducible antield brst-anti-brst quan-

tization of reducible gauge theories

the basic purpose of this section is to show how reducible gauge theories
can be quantized along the irreducible antield brst-anti-brst formal-
ism. this task can be accomplished by: (i) building an irreducible theory

10

equivalent to the original reducible one in a way that allows us to substitute
the brst quantization of the redundant system by that of the irreducible
one, and (ii) quantizing the resulting irreducible system within the brst-
anti-brst framework. the legitimacy of (ii) is implied by (i) and also by the
fact that the brst-anti-brst symmetry for a given theory exists provided
the standard brst symmetry for that theory can be enforced.

pass to the concrete construction of an irreducible theory associated with

(65) invariant. from (65) we observe that the weak equality associated with
the new system coincides with that corresponding to the original theory
because the eld equations of the supplementary elds are trivial.

now, it is easy to show that the gauge transformations (6669) are irre-

for some arbitrary functions 2k+1. inserting (75) in (70), it results that

2k  0  2k+1  0,

(76)

13

so the gauge transformations with the parameters (70) are trivial. this estab-
lishes the irreducibility of the gauge transformations (6669). the prior con-
struction of the irreducible gauge transformations does not guarantee their
completeness. in fact, it is impossible to proof in general the completeness
of the irreducible gauge transformations (6669) as it depends on the choice
of the matrices a k
k1 and also on the original reducibility matrices. this is
why in the sequel we assume the completeness of (6669). this feature is re-
quired by the possibility to construct a weakly nilpotent longitudinal exterior
derivative along the gauge orbits connected with the irreducible theory.

at this point we investigate whether it is legitimate or not to replace the
brst quantization of the reducible theory by that of the irreducible system
constructed previously. initially, we construct the brst symmetry associ-
ated with the irreducible system. first, we derive the koszul-tate dierential
in a way that ensures its acyclicity. the minimal antield spectrum includes
the fermionic antields

with antighost number one, and the bosonic antields

such that  is clearly nilpotent, 2 = 0. relations (8081) give rise to the co-
cycles

tions of these co-cycles which are -exact. however, this does not ensure the
separate -exactness of 
2k . let us prove that these co-cycles
are indeed -exact. for deniteness we expose the case l even, the other

by z l1

takes the form

the last relations enforce the triviality of the above mentioned co-cycles at
antighost number one. moreover, there are no non trivial cocycles at resolu-
tion degrees greater than one due to the irreducibility of the gauge transfor-
mations (6669), hence the irreducible koszul-tate dierential is acyclic.

the construction of the longitudinal exterior dierential along the gauge
orbits, d, follows the general irreducible brst line [5], the hypothesis of
completeness on the irreducible gauge transformations ensuring the weak

15

nilpotency of d without introducing any ghosts of ghosts. under these con-
siderations, the homological perturbation theory [31][34] guarantees the ex-
istence of the irreducible brst symmetry, si. we observe that the two
theories display the same classical observables as the elds (2k )k=1,...,a are
not eectively involved with the action (65) (of the irreducible system), be-
ing therefore purely gauge. consequently, the observables of the irreducible
theory do not depend on these elds and check the equations

f
0

z 0

1  0,

(90)

which are nothing but the equations that must be veried by the observables
of the reducible theory. as the observables of the irreducible and reducible
theories coincide, the zeroth order cohomological groups corresponding to
the irreducible and reducible formulations are also equal

h 0 (si) = h 0 (sr) ,

(91)

with sr denoting the reducible brst symmetry. hence, the irreducible and
reducible theories are equivalent from the brst point of view, i.e., from the
point of view of the basic equations describing this formalism

s2 = 0, h 0 (s) = {physical observables} .

(92)

the last conclusion ensures that we can substitute the brst quantization of
the reducible theory by that of the irreducible system derived at the beginning
of this section. taking into account that both the existence and construction
of the antield brst-anti-brst symmetry are essentially based on the ex-
istence of the standard lagrangian brst symmetry, it follows that we can
safely replace the brst-anti-brst quantization of the original reducible
theory with that of the irreducible system. this is the concern of the next
subsection.

3.2

irreducible antield brst-anti-brst quantization

in this subsection we perform the brst-anti-brst quantization of the ir-
reducible theory constructed in the previous subsection, which is described
by the action (65) and is subject to the irreducible gauge transformations
(6669). the initial eld spectrum and gauge parameters are respectively

16

given by (2k )k=0,,a and (2k+1)k=0,,b, hence we can make the following
analogies between (2) and our system

i  (2k )k=0,,a ,   (2k+1)k=0,,b ,

(93)

where ri
 is expressed in our case by a matrix containing (a + 1)  (b + 1)
blocks of elements z 2k
in
agreement with the discussion from section 2, the eld, ghost and antield
spectra (see (11) and (2325)) are organized as

2k1 structured accordingly (6669).

as we have already discussed in the previous subsection, there appear some
problems connected with the existence of some apparently non trivial co-
cycles for the koszul-tate operator in the context of the antield brst
formulation (see formulas (8081)). the same problem is present within the

brst-anti-brst approach, namely, the co-cycles

(100)) are both 1- and 2-closed. however, the rst two sets of co-cycles are
killed in the homology of 2, and the same is for the other two sets, but
in the homology of 1 (see (105)). in fact, all the co-cycles (2)
and (1)
are dropped out from the homology of 1, respectively, 2 by means of the
bar variables (see 105108). in consequence, the only dangerous co-cycles

in consequence, there are no non trivial co-cycles of 1 and 2 at positive
resolution bidegrees because on the one hand we established that all the
co-cycles at resolution bidegree (1, 0) or (0, 1) are trivial, and, on the other
hand, the appearance of non trivial co-cycles at higher order resolution bide-
grees is prevented precisely by the irreducibility of the gauge transformations
(6669). all these results lead to the conclusion that the koszul-tate compo-
nents 1 and 2 furnish a correct biresolution of c (), where  is dened
by the equations s0
0 = 0, such that it is permissible to approach the an-
tield brst-anti-brst quantization of the irreducible gauge theory along
the general lines exposed in section 2.

at this stage we construct the longitudinal exterior derivatives along the
gauge orbits, d1 and d2. in view of this we need to know the coecients
appearing at the commutators among the irreducible gauge transformations
(6669). as underlined in the previous subsection, it is reasonable to as-
sume the completeness of the irreducible gauge generators. this assumption
leads to the next general relations expressing the on-shell closedness of the

the denitions of d1 and d2 acting on the generators (94) are constructed

it is clear that the gauge-xed action displays a propagating character. the
same line can be applied if one adds to the action (178) any interaction terms
that are invariant also under the gauge transformations (180).

5 conclusion

to conclude with, in this paper we develop a method that allows the applica-
tion of the irreducible antield brst-anti-brst quantization to a large class
of reducible gauge theories. the crucial point of our procedure is expressed by
the replacement of the starting reducible system by an equivalent irreducible
one, such that we can substitute the antield brst-anti-brst quantization
of the reducible theory with that of the corresponding irreducible system.
the quantization of the irreducible system follows the standard rules of the
irreducible antield brst-anti-brst method, the acyclicity of the koszul-
tate bicomplex being ensured. in due course we emphasize a possible class
of gauge-xing bosons which is relevant in the context of our procedure. fi-
nally, we show how our mechanism can be applied to practical solutions on
two models of interest.
