abstract

we study the strong coupling limit of the bethe ansatz solutions in the

massive thirring model. we nd analytical expressions for the energy eigen-

values for the vacuum state as well as nparticle n hole states. this formula
is compared with the numerical results and is found to achieve a very good

agreement.

also, it is found that the 2particle 2 hole and higher particlehole
states describe n free bosons states in this limit. the behaviors of the
strong coupling limit of the boson mass for various model calculations are

examined. we discuss an ambiguity of the coupling constant normalization

due to the current regularization.

1. introduction

recent calculations for the massive thirring model have presented a

debate over the energy spectrum of the bound states [1-4]. several

dierent methods give dierent results on the spectrum of the bound

state. for a long time, people have believed that the semiclassical re-

sults which are obtained by dashen et al.[5] are exact in spite of the

fact that they took into account only the lowest order quantum uctu-

ations in the path integral method. however, the recent calculation by

the light cone procedure shows that there is only one bound state, and

the spectrum of the bound state energy as the function of the coupling

constant is dierent from the semiclassical result [1-3].

further, the recent calculations based on the bethe ansatz solutions [4]

present a numerical proof that there is only one bound state, and the

spectrum seems to be consistent with the light cone results.

in this paper, we present analytical calculations of the strong coupling

limit of the bethe ansatz solutions for the massive thirring model and

show that the analytical expressions obtained here agree very well with

those calculated by numerically solving the periodic boundary condi-

tion (pbc) equations of the bethe ansatz solutions [6-7].

here, we obtain the energy eigenvalues of the vacuum, 1p1h states
(symmetric and asymmetric cases ) and 2p2h and higher particle
hole states (symmetric case), which agree very well with the numerical

results. the analytical formula shows that the n particlen hole state
is just n times 1p1h state energy (a boson mass). this shows that
the n particlen hole states are all scattering states.
further, we show the behaviors of the strong coupling limit of the boson

mass for various model calculations. it turns out that the analytical

2

expression of the boson mass at the strong coupling limit with the

bethe ansatz solutions is dierent from the light cone prediction. this

may indicate that the normalization ambiguity of the coupling constant

due to the fermion current regularization in the massive thirring model

is more complicated than expected from the massless thirring model.

for the massless thirring model, klaiber [8] proves that the coupling

constant has a normalization ambiguity which arises from the fermion

current regularization. in the case of the massive thirring model,

it is expected that the same type of the coupling constant ambiguity

may well appear. if we assume that the coupling constant ambiguity is

the same between the massive and massless thirring models, then we

have the following relation between the schwinger and johnson type

coupling constants, g0 and g [9-10],

g0 =

2g
2  g



.

(1.1)

which of the coupling constant normalization one takes depends on

the way one regularizes the current. but the problem is that it is not

very easy to realize which kind of the current regularization is taken in

the actual calculation. further, the massive thirring model may well

be dierent from the massless case concerning the current regulariza-

tion. the regularization of the bethe ansatz solution is presumably the

same as schwingers normalization. however, we will see later that the

normalization

ambiguity of the coupling constant is more complicated than expected

for the massive thirring model. at the present stage, we believe that

the bethe ansatz solution takes a slightly dierent coupling constant

normalization from schwingers one.

3

therefore, we denote the coupling constant of the bethe ansatz solution

by gb.

in the next section, we briey describe the bethe ansatz method which

is applied to solving the massive thirring model. in section iii, we dis-

cuss the periodic boundary conditions (pbc) which are very important

to calculate any physical observables. then, section iv treats numerical

calculations of the pbc equations in the strong coupling region.

in section v, we discuss analytical expressions for the energy eigenval-

ues

with the strong coupling expansion, and compare them with the nu-

merical calculations. we also examine the boson mass at the strong

coupling limit for various model calculations. finally, section vi sum-

marizes what we have understood in this paper.

2. massive thirring model and bethe ansatz solutions

the massive thirring model is a 1+1 dimensional eld theory with

current current interactions [11]. its lagrangian density can be written

as

l = (i  m0) 
where the fermion current j is written as

1
2

gbjj

j =:  : .

(2.1)

(2.2)

the coupling constant is denoted by gb since it may be dierent from

schwingers normalization.

choosing a basis where 5 is diagonal, the hamiltonian is written

h = z dx"i(1


x

1  2


x

2) + m0(12 + 21) + 2gb1221# .

(2.3)

(2.4)

the number operator n is dened as

n = z dx.

the hamiltonian eq.(2.3) can be diagonalized by the bethe ansatz wave

function (x1, ..., xn ) for n particles which can be written as

(x1, ..., xn ) = exp(im0x xi sinh i) y1i<jn

[1 + i(i, j)(xi  xj)]
(2.5)

where i is related to the momentum ki and the energy ei of the i-th

particle as

ki = m0 sinh i

ei = m0 cosh i

5

(2.6a)

(2.6b)

where is are complex variables.

(x) is a step function and is dened as

1 x < 0
1 x > 0.

(x) = 


(i, j) is related to the phase shift function (i  j) as

1 + i(i, j)
1  i(i, j)

= exp [(i  j)] .

the phase shift function (i  j) can be explicitly written as

(i  j) = 2 tan1(cid:20) 1

2

gb tanh

1
2

(i  j)(cid:21) .

in this case, the eigenvalue equation becomes

(2.7)

(2.8)

(2.9)

h | 1...n >=

n

xi=1

m0 cosh i | 1...n >

(2.10)

where | 1...n > is related to (x1, ..., xn ) as
yi=1

| 1...n >= z dx1...dxn (x1, ..., xn )

n

(xi, i) | 0 > .

also, (x, ) can be written in terms of 1(x) and 2(x) as,

(x, ) = e



2 1(x) + e 

2 2(x).

(2.11)

(2.12)

from the denition of the rapidity variable is, one sees that for posi-

tive energy particles, is are real while for negative energy particles, i

takes the form i  i where is are real. therefore, in what follows,
we denote the positive energy particle rapidity by i and the negative

energy particle rapidity by i.

6

3. periodic boundary conditions and regularization

the bethe ansatz wave functions satisfy the eigenvalue equation [eq.(2.10)].

however, they still do not have proper boundary conditions. the sim-

plest way to dene eld theoretical models is to put the theory in a

box of length l and impose periodic boundary conditions (pbc) on

the states.

therefore, we demand that (x1, .., xn ) be periodic in each argument

xi. this gives the boundary conditions

(xi = 0) = (xi = l).

(3.1)

this leads to the following pbc equations,

exp(im0l sinh i) = exp(ixj

(i  j)).

taking the logarithm of eq.(3.2), we obtain

m0l sinh i = 2ni xj

(i  j)

(3.2)

(3.3)

where nis are integer. these are equations which should be solved.

before solving the pbc equations, we wish to discuss the regularization

of the fermion current. this is somehow a complication

of the massive thirring model. the thirring model has an ambiguity

that comes from current regularization. for gauge eld theories, there

is no ambiguity concerning the current regularization since one has to

make gauge invariant regularization.

if one makes gauge invariant regularization, then one obtains physical

quantities which do not depend on the choice of the regularization

methods.

7

the thirring model has no local gauge invariance and thus has some

ambiguity that arises from the way of making regularization. as klaiber

proves, the coupling constant is related to each other depending on the

regularization. however, there is no denite way of describing the cou-

pling constant relation for the massive thirring model. it is not very

clear whether eq.(1.1) holds for the massive thirring model

as well or not. we will discuss it later in detail.

8

4. numerical solutions

to construct physical states, we have two parameters, the box length

l and the particle number n. in this case, the density of the system 

becomes

where n0 is dened as n0 = 1

 =

n0
l
2 (n  1).

(4.1)

(a) vacuum state

first, we want to make a vacuum. we write the pbc equations

for the vacuum which is lled with negative energy particles (

i = i  i ),
2ni
l0 

sinh i =

2

l0 xj6=i

tan1(cid:20)1

2

gb tanh

1
2

(i  j)(cid:21) ,

(i = 1, .., n)

(4.2)

where l0 is dened as l0 = m0l.

now, ni runs as

ni = 0,1,2, ...,n0.

therefore, ni can be replaced by i and thus eq.(4.2) becomes

sinh i =

2i
l0 

2

l0 xj6=i

tan1(cid:20)1

2

gb tanh

1
2

(i  j)(cid:21) ,

(i = 0,1, ..,n0).

(4.3)

we x the values of l0 and n, and we can solve eq.(4.3). this

determines the vacuum. in this case, the vacuum energy ev can

be written as

ev = 

n0

xi=n0

m0 cosh i.

(4.4)

to describe physical states, we have to renormalize the energy

to some physical point. therefore, m0 itself does not play any

important role.

9

(b) 1p  1h state

next, we want to make one particle-one hole (1p  1h) states.
that is, we take out one negative energy particle (i0-th particle)

and put it into a positive energy state.

in this case, the pbc

equations become

sinh i =



i 6= i0

i = i0

2i

l0 xj6=i,i0

(i0 + j)(cid:21)

(4.5b)

where i0 can be a complex variable as long as it can satisfy

eqs.(4.5).

these pbc equations determine the energy of the one particle-one

hole states which we denote by e(i0)
1p1h,

e(i0)
1p1h = m0 cosh i0 

n0

xi=n0

i6=i0

m0 cosh i.

(4.6)

it is important to notice that the momentum allowed for the posi-

tive energy state must be determined by the pbc equations. also,

the momenta occupied by the negative energy particles are dier-

ent from the vacuum case.

the lowest conguration one can consider is the case in which one

takes out i = 0 particle and puts it into the positive energy state.

this must be the rst excited state since it has a symmetry of

i = i. we call this state symmetric since it has a left-right
symmetry.

10

next, we consider the following congurations in which we take

out i0 = 1,2, .. particles and put them into the positive energy
state. these are congurations we can build up for one particle-

one hole state.

(c) 2p  2h states

in the same way as above, we can make two particle-two hole

(2p  2h) states. here, we take out the i1th and the i2th
particles and put them into positive energy states. the pbc

equations for the two particle-two hole states become

i 6= i1, i2

in this case, the energy of the 2p  2h states e(i1,i2)

2p2h becomes

e(i1,i2)
2p2h = m0 cosh i1 + m0 cosh i2 

m0 cosh i.

(4.8)

n0

xi=n0

i6=i1,i2

here, we note that the symmetric case ( i1 = i2 ) always gains
the energy and therefore is lower than other asymmetric cases of

2p  2h states. higher particle-hole states are constructed just in
the same way as above.

(d) numerical method

now, we discuss the numerical method of solving the pbc equa-

tions. we solve them by the newton method. the type of equa-

tion we want to solve can be schematically written as

g(f ) = 0

(4.9)

where f = (f1, f2, .., fn ) are the n variables that should be deter-

mined. g is some function. first, we denote some initial solution

by f0. we expand eq.(4.9) near f0 as

f = f0 + x

g(f0) +

g(f0)

f0

x = 0.

(4.10)

(4.11)

we solve this equation for x and put them into eq.(4.10). this

leads to a new set of f , and we consider f as a new f0 and repeat

the same procedure until we get some convergent results for f .

this method has a great advantage over the iteration method

proposed in ref.[4], namely it gives a good convergence even for

the strong coupling region. however, there is a disadvantage which

12

is connected to the matrix diagonalization of eq.(4.11). normally,

the matrix diagonalization can be possible only for a few thousand

of matrix dimensions if we have to know all of the eigenvalues.

we note that the calculated energies of ev, e(0)

1p1h and e(n)

1p1h for the

several cases of the coupling constants with the particle number

n = 1601 agree perfectly with those calculated in ref.[4].

in later section, we will compare the calculated values of the vac-

uum, 1p 1h, and 2p 2h energies with the analytical expressions
in the strong coupling region.

5. strong coupling expansion

here, we present the strong coupling expansion of the pbc equations.
since gb varies from  1
further, we note that the beta function

2 to , we can take the limit of gb  .

of the massive thirring model vanishes to all orders [15], and ther-

fore, there is no need to consider the cuto dependence of the coupling

constant. this is consistent with the fact that the massive thirring

model

is an integrable eld theory which forbids the particle pair creations.

therefore, the scattering is always elastic, and thus there is no coupling

constant renormalization.

(a) vacuum state

13

first, we treat the pbc equations for the vacuum and some parts

of the results are presented in ref[16]. we assume that gb is much

larger than any of the rapidity i, namely,

gb  i.

(5.1)

in this case, the last term of eq.(4.2) becomes

2

l0 xj6=i

tan1(cid:20) 1

2

gb tanh

2

(i  j)(cid:21) =

2

l0 xj6=i" 

2

(i  j) 

4

gb(i  j)
(5.2)

+ ...# .

therefore, we can easily prove that eq.(4.2) reduces to

i =

8

l0 xj6=i

1

gb(i  j)

+ ...

(5.3)

the term arizing from (i  j) cancels out the rst term of
eq.(4.2). since i is small, we can rewrite eq.(5.3) in terms of
bi = gbl0i,

bi  bj
further, the vacuum energy is written as

bi = 8xj6=i

since bis have the symmetry of bi = bi, we can rewrite eq.(5.4)
as

(i = 1,   , n0).

(5.6)

from this equation, we can easily obtain

n0

xi=1

b2
i = 8n0(n0  1) + 12n0.

(5.7)

therefore, the vacuum energy can be explicitly written up to 1/gb

order,

ev = (2n0 + 1)m0 

1

gbl

[8n0(n0  1) + 12n0] .

(5.8)

14

(b) 1p  1h state ( symmetric )

next, we treat the 1p  1h states [15]. we assign the positive en-
ergy particle by i0. in the strong coupling limit, eqs.(4.5) become

(i + i0)

(i  j)

these equations have two solutions, the symmetric and the asym-

metric solutions. for the symmetric case, one easily sees, since

i = i

i0 = 0.

(5.10)

also, for other is, the equations can be rewritten using bis,

b2
i = 16

xj=1

(i = 1,   , n0).

(5.11)

in this case, we can evaluate the energy of 1p 1h symmetric case
in the same way as the vacuum and obtain

e(0)
1p1h = (2n0  1)m0 

1

gbl

[8n0(n0  1) + 4n0] .

(5.12)

therefore, the 1p  1h energy for the i0 = 0 case with respect to
the vacuum becomes

e(0)

1p1h = 2m0 +

8n0
gbl

.

(5.13)

15

(c) 1p  1h states ( asymmetric )

now, we discuss the asymmetric solutions. in this case, we obtain

the following coupled equations up to 1/gb.

therefore, we should calculate the cosh i0 and the sum of the

reduced to a cubic equation with x  tanh(i0/2),

it is easy to show that this cubic equation has a root in the 0 <

x < 1 at gb > 0. therefore, we can put

x = 1  ,

(  1)

(5.18)

where  must be a positive value. substituting this equation into

(d) 2p  2h and higher particlehole states

now, we consider 2p 2h and higher particlehole states. in this
case, the symmetric solutions always gain the energy. therefore,

we only treat the symmetric solution here.

18

due to the symmetry, we can easily nd

0 = 0.

(5.28)

let us rst consider the 2p2h conguration. we assume that the
i0th and the i0th particles are in the positive energy state.
in this case, eqs.(4.7) reduce to

b2
i = 16

+ 12

(i 6= i0)

(i = i0).

n01

xj=1
bi = 

j

b2
i
b2
i  b2
4
bi

(5.29a)

(5.29b)

note that this leads to the stringlike congurations since the
solution for bi0 becomes pure imaginary. that is,

bi0 = 2i.

in terms of i0, this becomes

i0 = 

2

gbl0

i.

therefore, the rapidity interval  of the string becomes

 =

4

gbl0

i + o


i

3

g

2
b




(5.30)

(5.31)

where we explicitly write the behavior of the next order of 1/gb

expansion.

on the other hand, bergkno and thacker [6] assume that the

rapidity interval of the string behaves for large gb as

bt =

4
gb

i.

(5.32)

this behavior as the function of gb does not agree with eq.(5.31)

which is a solution of the pbc equation. therefore, the string

19

congurations taken by bergkno and thacker are not consistent

with the string-like solution that satises the pbc equations. but

this is not at all surprising if one considers the way of obtaining

the string congurations by bergkno and thacker. they assume

that the wave functions of the particles should not diverge at xi =

 as a sucient condition. however, this cannot happen due to
the two reasons. the rst reason is that one constructs the eld

theory in the box of 0  xi  l. therefore, the boundary is always
periodic, that is, the wave functions at xi = l and xi = 0 are

the same. the second reason is more physical. the interactions

between particles considered here are always repulsive. therefore,

the wave functions cannot diverge at any points of the space, since

they are in the scattering states as bare particles.

to avoid the confusions which have been kept by some people in-

cluding experts in this eld, we clarify the string picture which is

originally introduced in the nonlinear schrdinger model. in this

case, the string corresponds to the bound states of the particles

since they make bound states due to the attractive  type in-
teraction. however, this is only possible for the bosonic particles.

for fermions, there is neither two particle bound state nor three

or higher particle bound state due to the pauli principle with the

 type interaction. in the massive thirring model, therefore, we
should not consider the string conguration which simulates the

many particle bound states.

now, in the same way as the vacuum case, we obtain the energy

for the 2p  2h state

e(0)
2p2h = (2n0  3)m0 

1

gbl

[8n0(n0  1)  4n0]

(5.33)

20

where we have ignored those terms which vanish when l  
with n0/l nite. therefore, the 2p  2h energy with respect to
the vacuum becomes

e(0)

2p2h = 4m0 +

16n0
gbl

.

(5.34)

for higher p  h states, we can evaluate the energy just in the
same way as the 2p  2h state case. for n-particle-n-hole states,
the energy with respect to the vacuum can be written as

e(0)

npnh = 2nm0 +

8nn0
gbl

.

(5.35)

it is important to nd that the npnh state energy is just n times
as large as that of 1p  1h state energy, that is,

e(0)

npnh = ne(0)

1p1h.

(5.36)

this shows that the n-particle-n-hole states are composed of n

free bosons in this limit.

this result is consistent with the numerical calculations presented

in ref.[4].

(e) comparison with numerical results

it should also be interesting to check the accuracy of eqs.(5.8),(5.13)

and (5.27). this can be done by comparing the prediction with

numerical results that have been solved by computers.

in table 1, we show the comparison of the vacuum energies be-

tween the analytical expressions and the numerical calculations

for the two cases of coupling constants with the number of parti-

cles of n = 1601. as can be seen from the table, we nd quite

21

a good agreement between the predictions of the strong coupling

expansion and the exact numerical calculations. in tables 2 and

3, we show the same comparison of the 1p  1h (symmetric) and
1p  1h (asymmetric) energies. again, we see a good agreement
between the analytical expressions and the numerical calculations.

this indicates that the strong coupling expansion is indeed a good

approximate scheme.

(f) bound states at the strong coupling limit

now, we calculate the bound state of the massive thirring model

at the strong coupling limit. in ref.[4], fujita et al. showed that

there is one isolated boson state and all the other states are contin-

uum states. therefore, the 1p-1h continuum energy should start

from the free fermion antifermion mass, that is twice the physical

fermion mass.

m =

1

2 (cid:16)e(1)

1p1h  ev(cid:17) .

thus, the bound state mass m can be dened as


m = 2m lim


e(0)
1p1h
e(1)
1p1h




where e(1)

1p1h is given for the large 

e(1)

1p1h = e(1)

1p1h  ev
m0 +"2 

=

3
2

4
gb

+  8

gbm0 

22

m0 ! 1

l# 

thus, at the large l and  limit, e(1)
m0 + 2 

e(1)

1p1h =

3
2

4

gb! .

1p1h becomes

22

(5.37)

(5.38)

(5.39)

(5.40)

finally, from eq.(5.38) and eq.(5.40), we obtain the bound state

mass as

2m0 +

m0 + 2

m = 2m lim

(5.41)

this result can be compared with the prediction of fujita and

ogura in the innite momentum frame calculation.

mfo  22

m
g0

.

(5.42)

as can be seen, they are dierent from each other if we assume

gb = g0. in ref.[4], it was shown that the bethe ansatz solutions for

several cases of the coupling constant are consistent with those of

innite momentum frame calculation by fujita and ogura [1] with

the identication of gb = g0. however, it became also apparent

that the boson mass calculated by the bethe ansatz solution starts

to deviate from the light cone result in the strong coupling region.

this dierence may well be related to the normalization ambiguity

of the coupling constant in the massive thirring model, as will be

discussed below.

(g) coupling constant ambiguity

as klaiber pointed out long time ago, there is an ambiguity of

the coupling constant in the massless thirring model.

it arises

from the way of regularizing the fermion current. here, we briey

23

review the normalization ambiguity of the coupling constant in

the massless thirring model [8,12].

for the right mover fermion eld r, we can express it by the

massless boson elds r and l as

r = eisritl

(5.43)

where s and t are free parameters which satisfy the following con-

straint

s2  t2 = 4.

(5.44)

the s and t can be expressed in terms of the boson coupling

constant  as

s =

t =

1
2
1
2

(

(

+ )

4

4
  ).

(5.45a)

(5.45b)

now, the fermion current regularization gives another constraint.

for example, schwingers regularization which makes the fermion

current regularization only in terms of the space coordinate point

splitting implies that

t =

g0
2

(s  t).

in this case, one obtains the following equation,

2
4

=

1

1 + g0


.

(5.46)

(5.47)

on the other hand, johnsons regularization which makes the

fermion current

regularization in terms of the space-time coordinate point splitting

in a symmetric fashion implies that

t =

g
2

s.

24

(5.48)

in this case, one obtains the following equation,

2
4

=

2  g

2 + g


.

(5.49)

therefore, one obtains the relation between g0 and g as written in

eq.(1.1).

now, the question is whether the same equation (1.1) can hold for

the massive thirring model as well or not. the results of the boson

mass at the strong coupling limit for the light cone and the bethe

ansatz method indicate that the coupling constant ambiguity may

well be dierent from eq.(1.1) for the massive thirring model.

from the comparison of the numerical calculations and analytical

evaluations between the light cone and the bethe ansatz solutions,

we can anticipate the following relation between g0 and the bethe

ansatz coupling constant gb

gb = g0


22
2 +

b(cid:16)1  22
2 (cid:17)

b + g0





(5.50)

where b is a free parameter. in this case, the boson mass of the

bethe ansatz solutions at the strong coupling becomes identical

to the light cone result. if we take b  10, then the agreement
between the light cone result and the bethe ansatz solutions

become very good for whole range of the coupling constant.

from eq.(5.50), gb becomes for the small value of g0

gb  g0.

for the large value of g0, we obtain

22
2 .

gb  g0

25

(5.51a)

this can be derived if we assume the following relation for s and

t

t =

1
2

(

1
x  1)(s  t)

(5.51b)

where x is given as the solution of the following equation,
22
2 = 0.
(5.52)

22
2 # x 2 + gb

42
2 ! x 

  b +

" gb



(b  1) + b 

up to now, we do not know any physically simple meaning of

choosing the fermion current regularization which corresponds to

eq.(5.52). further studies of the normalization ambiguity of the

coupling constant arising from the fermion current regularization

would be very interesting since we believe that it may well be

related to some symmetry which is hidden in the massive thirring

model.

26

6. conclusions

we have presented numerical calculations as well as the analytical ex-

pressions of the energy eigenvalues of the vacuum and n particle n hole

states in the strong coupling regions. it is found that the analytical

expressions agree very well with the numerical values of the vacuum

and 1p1h state energies for the large values of the coupling constant.
from the analytical expressions, we nd that the 2p  2h and higher
particle hole states appear as free boson states in the strong coupling

limit. this is consistent with the recent proof [13] that the s-matrix

factorization assumed by zamolodchikov and zamolodchikov [14] is vi-

olated at the quantum level, and therefore, the spectrum predicted by

the s-matrix factorization is only semiclassical.

we have also obtained the boson mass m at the strong coupling limit
analytically. to compare the present result with other calculations, we

write here the expressions of the boson mass at the strong coupling

limit for various calculations.

, mfo is the prediction of the light cone calculation
by fujita and ogura, and the present result is denoted by mba. if we
identify gb = g0, then mba is dierent from the light cone calculation.
at the present stage, we believe that the coupling constant normal-

ization arising from the fermion current regularization in the massive

27

thirring model is slightly dierent from the massless thirring model.

it may well be

that the regularization ambiguity is related to some hidden symmetry

which is not clearly understood up to now.

we would like to thank m. hiramoto and a. ogura for helpful discus-

sions and comments.
