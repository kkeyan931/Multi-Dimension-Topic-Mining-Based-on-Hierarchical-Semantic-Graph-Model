abstract

we study three dimensional gauge theories with n = 2 supersymmetry. we show
that the coulomb branches of such theories may be rendered compact by the dynam-
ical generation of chern-simons terms and present a new class of mirror symmetric
theories in which both coulomb and higgs branches have a natural description in
terms of toric geometry.

1 introduction

mirror symmetry of three dimensional gauge theories is an infra-red equivalence of two
theories in which coulomb and higgs branches, and fayet-iliopoulos parameters and
masses are exchanged. first discovered in n = 4 theories by intriligator and seiberg
[1], explanations in terms of string theory dualities [2] as well as generalisations to
both other gauge groups [3] and n = 2 gauge theories [4, 5] soon appeared. more
recently it has been shown that, for a large class of three-dimensional theories, the
correspondence may be extended to all length scales [6].

in this paper we present further examples of mirror theories with n = 2 super-
symmetry. a novel feature of these theories is that the coulomb branch may be
compact and is naturally described in the language of toric geometry.
in fact we
will nd that the coulomb branch, which in three dimensions admits a toric action,
possesses submanifolds on which certain cycles of the torus vanish and thereby de-
nes a toric variety. further we nd pairs of theories for which the coulomb (higgs)
branch of one theory and the higgs (coulomb) branch of the other are specied by the
same toric data. a classical analysis of the higgs branch in question simply yields the
usual symplectic quotient construction of the corresponding toric variety. in contrast,
various quantum eects which are characteristic to three dimensions play a central
role in realizing the same toric variety as the coulomb branch of the mirror theory.
this equivalence means, in particular, that the two branches admit identical u(1)
isometries with precisely the same set of xed submanifolds. as we are dealing with
theories with only four supercharges it is not obvious whether the correspondence
extends to the respective metrics on the two branches. despite this, we will nd that
the two metrics do in fact agree in cases where an explicit calculation is possible

the plan of the paper is as follows:

in section 2 we review various aspects of
abelian gauge theories in three dimensions.
in section 3 we present a simple self-
mirror theory for which both the higgs and coulomb branch is a copy if cp1. fi-
nally, in section 4 we consider a more general abelian gauge theory and employ the
language of toric geometry. the appendix contains a discussion of the brane realisa-
tion of the theory of section 3. as this work was in preparation, [7] appeared which
considers similar theories. the connection between three-dimensional chern-simons
gauge theories and the related phenomenon of mirror symmetry in two-dimensional
calabi-yau -models has been discussed in [8].

2 review of n=2 gauge theories

three dimensional gauge theories with n = 2 supersymmetry (4 supercharges) have
been studied in detail in [5], where a comprehensive introduction to these theories
may be found. here we collate some facts relevant to abelian gauge theories, with a

1

u(1)r gauge group and n chiral multiplets. to this end, we introduce abelian vector
superelds va, a = 1,    , r, and chiral superelds qi, i = 1    , n, both of which are
simply the dimensional reduction of the familiar four dimensional n = 1 superelds.
the gauge kinetic terms are written most simply in terms of linear superelds a =
 ddva, whose lowest component is a real scalar a and also includes the u(1)
eld strength as well as two majorana fermions. the chiral multiplets consist of a
complex scalar, qi and further majorana fermions. the kinetic terms for all elds are
written as d-terms,

lk = z d4 " n
xi=1

q

xa=1

where ea is the ath gauge coupling constant which has dimension (mass)1/2 and ra
i are
the charges of the chiral multiplets under each of the gauge symmetries. we assume
these charges to be integers. further interactions take the form of a superpotential,
w, constructed from gauge invariant monomials of the chiral superelds,

lf = z d2 w(qi) + h.c.

in particular, if there exist two chiral superelds of opposite charge the usual complex
mass is written is this manner. in three dimensions each chiral multiplet may have
a further, real, mass parameter which cannot be written in terms of a superpotential
and which will play an important role in the following discussion. it is introduced by
weakly gauging the cartan-subalgebra of the global avour symmetry of the theory
and constraining the vector multiplet scalar to a xed background vacuum expectation
value (vev),

lm = z d4

n

xi=1

q

i exp(2mi)qi

notice that there are only n  r independent such parameters, the remaining r being
set to zero by shifts of the vector multiplet scalars a.

two further sets of couplings will also prove important in the story: fayet-
iliopoulis (fi) parameters a which have dimension of mass, and dimensionless chern-
simons (cs) parameters ab. the former are incorporated in the usual fashion,

lf i =

r

xa=1

az d4 va

while the latter are written in terms of the linear supereld as,

lcs =

r

xa,b=1

notice from the similarity of these two expression that the combinations of scalar

elds pb abb will play the role of a dynamical fi parameter in the theory. this

may be seen by examining the classical scalar potential, obtained by integrating out
auxiliary elds,

is the eective mass of the ith chiral multiplet. the manifold of classical supersym-
metric vacua, determined by the condition u = 0, depends on the parameters a, ab
and mi. let us consider situations with w = 0. then there may be two branches of
vacua: the higgs and coulomb branches. in the former, the vector multiplet scalars
are set to zero, a = 0, while the qis are constrained by the vanishing of the rst
expression in (1) modulo gauge transformations. in this phase the gauge symmetry is
generically completely broken. it is clear from the form of (1) that the higgs branch
does not exist for generic non-zero real masses.

on the coulomb branch, all chiral multiplet scalars are set to zero, qi = 0, while
the as are unconstrained. again, from (1), it is clear that non-zero fi or cs
parameters will lift the coulomb branch. when this phase exists however the gauge
symmetry is completely unbroken and one may exchange each abelian gauge eld for a
scalar, a, of period ea, via the duality transformation f 
a = a. the coulomb
branch is therefore parametrised by the vevs of both a and a, which combine to
lie in r chiral multiplets, and is classically given by (r  s1)r. there exist r u(1)j
isometries of the coulomb branch induced by constant shifts of the r dual photons.
these are preserved in the full quantum theory [5]. in the following it will sometimes
be useful to weakly gauge these symmetries.
in particular, consider gauging the
symmetry which shifts a by a constant and leaves the other dual photons invariant.
as explained in [5], the lowest component of the linear multiplet which contains the
corresponding eld strength is precisely the fi parameter a.
in addition to pure
higgs and coulomb branches there will also exist mixed branches of vacua in which
both qs and s have non-zero vev.

this concludes our discussion of the classical eld theory. let us now mention
some relevant quantum eects that occur. firstly note that in four dimensions a
i = 0
for each gauge group a. in three dimensions, while there are no gauge anomalies, the
theory may suer from a parity anomaly [9]. this manifests itself in the dynamical
generation of cs terms due to integrating out chiral multiplet fermions at one-loop

theory with the above matter content would suer a gauge anomaly unless pi ra

[5]. in the case of w = 0, the eective cs term is given by,

e
ab = ab + 1

xi=1

ra

(3)

the parity anomaly arises from the observation that gauge invariance requires e
be an integer and therefore, for certain matter content, the factor of 1
a non-zero bare cs term is obligatory, breaking parity.

ab to
2 in (3) means

a similar cs coupling is also generated for weakly gauged global symmetries of
the type discussed earlier in this section. in particular, for the element of the cartan-
subalgebra of the global avour group under which qi transforms with charge +1,
with all other elds neutral, one has

e
ai = 1

2ri

a sign mi

finally, the combined eect of all dynamically generated cs parameters may be
interpreted as a nite renormalisation of the fi parameters,

 e
a = a +

(4)

ab are ill-dened. however, the fi parameters  e

notice that the gauge and global symmetries appear on an equal footing in this
expression. further, for mi = 0, which is the case on the higgs branch, sign mi
and e
a are of the form mi sign mi
and are therefore continuous at mi = 0. finally, these one-loop corrections can be
implemented in the scalar potential (1), simply by replacing the fi parameters and
cs terms by the renormalised fi parameters (4).

there is one further quantum eect, discussed in [5], that will be important for
us. at the intersection of coulomb and higgs branches, certain u(1)j isometries,
which are generically broken on the coulomb branch, must be restored as the higgs
branch is invariant under such symmetries. this, in turn, requires the vanishing of
the periods of the dualized scalars at these points and the coulomb branch is to
be viewed as a bre of t r over rr where certain cycles of the torus shrink at the
intersection points. this suggests that the coulomb branch can be thought of as a
toric variety specied in terms of toric data which encodes its intersections with other
branches. in the following sections we will realize this idea explicitly.

3 a self-mirror example

in this section we exhibit a simple n = 2 gauge theory in which both higgs and
coulomb branches are compact, the former classically and the latter due to the dy-
namical generation of cs terms. this will also serve as an pedagogical example for

4

more complicated models to be discussed in the following section. the theory has
a single abelian gauge group with bare fi parameter . the matter content con-
sists of two chiral multiplets, both transforming with charge +1 and with real masses
m1 = m2. we set both superpotential and bare cs parameter to zero so that the
eective one-loop couplings are given by,

e = 1

2 [sign ( + m) + sign (  m)]

similarly, the one-loop eective fi parameter is,

 e =  + 1

2( + m) sign ( + m) + 1

2(  m) sign (  m)

and the scalar potential (1) thus simplies to,

(5)

(6)

u = e2(cid:16)|q1|2 + |q2|2   e(cid:17)2

+ ( + m)2|q1|2 + (  m)2|q2|2

let us now examine solutions of the vacuum condition u = 0 of this theory as a
function of the fi and mass parameters. without loss of generality we may restrict
our attention to masses m  0. we will also set the bare cs coupling to zero. there
are then ve dierent regimes:

i) m =  = 0: in this case there is a unique vacuum at the origin  = q1 = q2 = 0.
ii) m = 0,  > 0: in this case we have a higgs branch of vacua given by  = 0,
and |q1|2 + |q2|2 =  modulo gauge transformations. this is simply wittens gauged
linear sigma model [10] with target space cp1 of kahler class .

iii) m > 0,  = m: in this case, requiring  e = 0 restricts the range of  to
||  m. therefore the space of vacua is given by q1 = q2 = 0 while  may take any
value in the interval, i = { : m    m}. we will discuss this case in more detail
below.

iv) m > 0,  > m: in this case there are two isolated higgs branch vacua. these
are located at  = m, |q1|2 = m, q2 = 0 and  = m, |q2|2 = m, q1 = 0 respectively.
v) m  0,  < m: in this case there are two isolated vacua on the coulomb

branch located at q1 = q2 = 0,  = .

the above vacuum structure may be reproduced by realising the theory as a d3-
brane probe of a (p, q) 5-brane web. this is done in the appendix, where we also
discuss the vacuum structure in the presence of a non-zero bare cs term.

the novel feature of case iii) above is the restriction of the range of  to an interval
i. for the critical value of the bare fi parameter,  = m, the coulomb branch is
therefore compact. after dualizing the massless photon in favour of a periodic scalar
, the coulomb branch can be thought as a bration of s1 over i. the u(1)j
symmetry which shifts  by a constant acts on the bre over each point. classically
the bration is trivial and simply corresponds to the cylinder i  s1. however we will
now argue that this picture is modied by quantum eects. the key idea, based on

5

the arguments of [5], is that the endpoints of the interval,  = m, must be invariant
under u(1)j . this follows because, at these two points, the coulomb branch intersects
the higgs branch of case iv) which must be invariant under u(1)j . strictly speaking,
moving onto the higgs branch requires changing the bare fi parameter  away from
its critical value. this means that one is moving to a dierent theory rather than
onto another vacuum branch of the same theory. this distinction is irrelevant here
because, as explained in the previous section, we can promote  to be the scalar
component of a background linear multiplet by weakly gauging u(1)j . the existence
of a new branch emenating from the endpoints of the interval then hinges on whether
or not this eld is massless. at a generic point on the coulomb branch u(1)j acts
non-trivially on the dual photon is therefore spontaneously broken. this means that
the corresponding gauge multiplet which contains  acquires a mass by the higgs
mechanism. conversely,  only remains massless at points on the coulomb branch at
which u(1)j remains unbroken.

the restoration of u(1)j discussed above is only possible if the s1 bre shrinks
to zero size at the endpoints of the interval. following [5], this eect which can be
ascribed to quantum corrections which are unsupressed near these points. the result
is a coulomb branch with the topology of a two sphere. as mentioned above, it is
natural to combine  and  to form a complex scalar which is the lowest component of
a chiral supereld. the coulomb branch can then be thought of as a kahler manifold
of complex dimension one. we therefore seek such a complex manifold which can be
realized as an s1 bration over an interval with degenerate bres at the endpoints.
this is precisely the data which species cp1 as a toric variety. in fact, as explained
in [11], the interval is just the toric diagram for cp1. in the following we will see that
this connection between three-dimensional coulomb branches and toric diagrams is
a general one.

in this simple case, one can also understand the symmetry between higgs and
coulomb branches by considering the original n = 4 self-mirror theory of intriligator
and seiberg [1]. in the n = 2 language this consists of a u(1) vector multiplet, a single
neutral chiral multiplet, two chiral multiplets of charge +1 and two of charge 1. a
superpotential couples all hypermultiplets. one may ow to the theory described
above by gauging various global symmetries (including a subgroup of one the su(2)
r-symmetries of the n = 4 algebra) and introducing mass terms for the unwanted
chiral multiplets. the duality properties should be invariant under such deformations
[5], and the higgs and coulomb branches should again be equal in the above theory.
finally, one may also see the emergence of the su(2)-invariant kahler metric on
cp1 by an explicit one-loop calculation on the coulomb branch. note however that,
unlike the theory with n = 4 supersymmetry, one has little control over the kahler
potential and the following calculation is only valid at points where e2  |  m|
and, in particular, cannot be trusted at the end points of the interval. nevertheless
we proceed with the calculation, encouraged by the end result. classically, the low-

6

energy dynamics on the coulomb branch are described by the metric,

ds2 = h()d2 + h()1d2

(7)

where classically h = 1/e2. as well as the renormalisation of the fi and cs pa-
rameters discussed above, there is also a nite renormalisation of the gauge coupling
constant,

h 1loop =

e2 +

|  m|

where the second equality follows only when  is restricted to the interval i. in the
limit, e2  , we thus nd that one-loop coulomb branch metric indeed becomes
the fubini-study metric on cp1 with kahler class m. notice that, as in the original
intriligator-seiberg model, the u(1)j symmetry of the coulomb branch is enhanced
in the infra-red to a su(2) symmetry. under mirror symmetry this is exchanged with
the su(2) avour symmetry of the theory while the fi parameter is exchanged with
the real mass.

4 mirror symmetry and toric geometry

in this section we discuss the more general mirror symmetric theories. specically,
we will consider,

theory a: u(1)r gauge theory with n chiral multiplets containing scalars qi of
charge ra
i , i = 1,    , n and a = 1,    , r. the parameters of the model are bare cs
couplings ab, bare fi parameters a and real masses mi. notice that only n  r of
the mass parameters are independent.

theory b: u(1)n r gauge theory with n chiral multiplets containing scalars qi of
i , u = 1,    , n r. the parameters are uv, u and mi, where n (n r) = r

charge su
of the mass parameters are independent.

the charges of theory a and theory b are constrained to satisfy,

ra

i su

i = 0

n

for all a and u

(8)

we denote the coulomb branch of theory a (b) as ma (b)

. notice rstly that dim(ma

c) = dim(mb

h ) = r and dim(mb

and the higgs branch as
h ) =

c) = dim(ma

n  r. similarly, the number of independent mass parameters of theory a (b) is
equal to the number of fi parameters of theory b (a).

let us start with the higgs branch of theory b in the case where the masses and

cs parameters vanish. this is dened as the symplectic quotient,

mb

a (a)/u(1)n r

h = 1
where the momentum map is a = pi su

(specically, when a lie in the kahler cone of mb

in which cn is parametrised by qi, and f is a subset of cn  cn . precisely which
subset is determined in terms of a fan of cones, , as will be reviewed below. the
action of (c)n r in the above quotient is the complexied gauge symmetry of theory
b, given by,

our rst task is to identify the set f. this is specied by the charges su
i , which we
may view as (n  r) charge vectors in zn . the rst step is to construct r vectors
orthogonal to su
i , courtesy
of equation (8). these charges then provide a convenient basis of gauge invariant
polynomials which parametrise mb
h,

i . these are provided by the charges of theory a, ra

with ka  zr. the charges, ra
these which are used to dene  as the collection of cones bounded by vectors from
the origin through the vertices. finally, the set f is dened as containing all sets
{qi = 0 : i  {i} } such that the corresponding set of vertices {ra
: i  {i} } does
i
not lie in any single cone of .

the toric variety dened in this manner has an action of cr. for each vertex

which is simply the complexied global avour symmetry of theory b. the limit
point,  = 0, of this symmetry is contained mb
h (as opposed to f) as the vertices

h. nevertheless, the vertices ra

are themselves the integral generators of one-dimensional cones and therefore clearly
belong to a single cone. notice however that the n actions dened by (9) are not all
linearly independant and do not necessarily include the full cr action admitted by
mb
i do encode the xed point structure of all abelian
isometries of mb
h and allow one to reconstruct the geometry of the toric variety. this
is the approach to toric geometry discussed in [11]. to each of the vertices ra
i , one
associates a a hyperplane, di, orthogonal to the vertex, on which the corresponding
cycle (9) is taken to vanish,

di  (ya  rr :

(10)

where ci are n constants. dene , a polytope of of dimension r, as the region
of rr bounded by the n hyperplanes di. importantly, by construction, a collection
of hyperplanes only intersect if the corresponding limit points are not in f. this
h may be viewed as a bration of t r over  such
ensures that the higgs branch, mb
that on the boundary di the cycle dened by ra
in equation (9) shrinks while, on
i
the intersection of k boundaries, k such cycles shrink.

if the vertices of  lie on zr, then  is said to be an integral reexive polytope.
these vertices then encode the information for a dual toric variety. this is batyrevs
construction of mirror manifolds [14].

this concludes our discussion of the higgs branch. the next part of the story
is to show that the coulomb branch of theory a, ma
c, corresponds to the same
toric variety. ma
c is parametrised by the r real scalars a and r dual photons, a.
the key point is that the s are restricted to lie within  due to cs terms, while
certain periods of the s vanish on the boundaries of this space thus giving a non-
trivial bration of t r over  as described above. to see this, take the constants ci
appearing in (10) to be dened by ci = mi for i = 1,    , n. then the equation
mi = 0, dened in (2), species the hyperplane di, dened in (10), spanned by the
a = ya  rr. thus the region  is specied by a choice of sign (mi) for each i. in
order to x this choice, consider the eective cs coupling (3),

e
ab = ab + 1
2

n

xi=1

ra

i rb

i sign (mi)

we see that a judicious choice of bare cs coupling ab will ensure that e
ab vanishes in
 and only in . as long as e
ab vanishes, it follows from equation (4), that we may
choose the bare fi parameters a in such a way that the eective fi parameters  e
a
vanish. in this case the part of the coulomb branch described by the a is precisely
.

as the hyperplane di is dened by mi = 0, one chiral multiplet becomes massless
on each component of the boundary of . thus, at least in the classical theory,

9

the hyperplane di is the root of a higgs branch on which qi 6= 0 and qj = 0 for all
j 6= i. as in the simple self-mirror example of the previous section, moving onto
this higgs branch requires changing the fi parameters. in fact, for each i, moving
onto the corresponding higgs branch requires varying the specic linear combination
ra
i  a away from its critical value. to analyse this transition, it is convenient to
promote this linear combination of the fi parameters to a background supereld.
after dualizing the gauge elds to periodic scalars, this corresponds to weakly gauging
a particular subgroup of the u(1)r
j , which shifts the corresponding
linear combination, ra
i a, of the dual photons. following the same arguments as in
section 3, the existence of the new branch in the quantum theory is only consistent
if this symmetry is unbroken. at a generic point on the coulomb branch the whole
of u(1)r
j must
be restored on the intersection between the two branches which in turn requires that
the corresponding cycle of the toric bre must degenerate over di. one may easily
check that this is exactly the same cycle as that dened in equation (9). this means
that coulomb branch of theory a precisely agrees with the description of mh
b given
above as a toric bration of the polytope . this completes our identication of ma
c
with mb
h.

j is spontaneously broken. hence, we predict that the subgroup u(1)(i)

j symmetry, u(1)(i)

let us illustrate the above ideas with the simple example of complex projective
space. the relevant toric data for this example can also be found in section 4 of [13].
we take,

theory a: u(1)n 1 gauge theory with n chiral multiplets of charge ra

i 
. the masses are mi = m for i = 1, n and mi = 0 for i = 2,    , n  1 where

i = a

2a1,b

(11)

theory b: u(1) gauge theory with n chiral multiplets of charge si = +1 for all

i. the masses and cs parameters are set to zero. the fi parameter is .

it is well known that the classical higgs branch of theory b is cpn 1 of kahler
class  [10], so we concentrate on the coulomb branch of theory a. notice rstly
that the charges ra
i and si satisfy (8). following the prescription above, we set
ci = m for i = 1, n and ci = 0 for i = 2,    , n  1. the hyperplanes di dened
in (10) are then given by yi  yi1 = m, where it is taken that y0  yn  0. the
vertices of  are given by the intersection points of any n  1 of the n hyperplanes,
i = d1      di      dn , where the hat denotes omission of the ith hyperplane.
v a
we thus nd that v a
i = (a  n)m for i  a. notice that,
for m  z, all v a

where m1 = 1  m, mi = i  i1 for i = 2,    , n  1 and mn = n 1  m.
identifying ya = a, we see that the equation for the hyperplane di is simply mi = 0
and, with the bare cs coupling given by equation (11) to be ab = 1
i , we
nd that e

which is indeed the polytope . further, on each boundary mi = 0, the scalar qi
i a must
shrink. choosing the a such that  e
a = 0, the coulomb branch is then given as a
toric variety to be cpn 1. notice that in the case of n = 2, the above theory diers
from the self-mirror theory introduced in the previous section.

although in the above example the moduli space of vacua is compact, more gen-
erally this will not be the case. in fact, compactness is assured only if the fan  spans
zr. in particular, in the case of a toric variety which obeys the calabi-yau condition

i = 0 for all u, the coulomb branch is always non-compact.

in this appendix we show how the vacuum structure of the self-mirror theory exhib-
ited in section 3 and, in particular, the compactness of the coulomb branch can be
rederived from a brane realisation of this theory. the relevant brane conguration is
the t-dual of that described in [15]. set-ups identical to the one discussed here were
also considered in [16]. we work in units  = 1 and set gst = 1.

the conguration of interest involves a d3-brane suspended between various 5-
brane webs in iib string theory. the rst of these webs consists of an ns5-brane
spanning worldvolume directions 012345, two d5-branes spanning worldvolume di-
rections 012346 and two (1, 1) 5-branes in directions 01234(56), where the direction
in (x 5, x 6)-plane is x 5 = x 6. the nal conguration is shown in gure 1 and is
positioned at x 7 = x 8 = x 9 = 0. the two d5-branes are located at x 5 = m
while, when m = 0, the ns5-brane is located at x 6 = 0. the position of this brane
for general m will be described below.

the second 5-brane web is much simpler, consisting of a single ns5-brane spanning
012589, which is traditionally called the ns5-brane. it is positioned at x 3 = x 4 = 0,

dotted lines represent the zero mode of the web.

x 7 = 1/e2 and x 6 = . finally a d3-brane is suspended between the web and ns5-
brane, spanning 0127. it is of nite length in the x 7 direction and is positioned at
x 5 = .

the low-energy dynamics of the d3-brane in this conguration are governed by the
three-dimensional gauge theory of section 3, with the dictionary between brane and
eld theory moduli explicitly given above. before examining the vacuum structure,
we must rst describe the zero mode of the 5-brane web corresponding to changing
m. this is denoted by the dotted lines in figure 1. notice that, xing the position
of the (1, 1) 5-branes at innity, the position of the ns5-brane is given by  = m.
let us now discuss the vacuum structure of the theory. the numbering here
coincides with that of section 2. each case is illustrated with a diagram in fig 2 in
which we draw only the 5-brane web, with the position of the d3-brane (which also
encodes the x 6 position of the ns5-brane) marked by a solid dot.

i) m =  = 0: the set up is shown in figure 2i). it is clear that the d3-brane has

a unique vacuum state at  = 0.

ii) m = 0,  > 0: this is shown in figure 2ii). the d3-brane ends on the two
coincident d5-branes located at  = 0. this is the higgs branch of the gauge theory
which, in the analogous two-dimensional theory, was argued in [15] to contain a copy
of cp1 that is hard to see from the brane picture.

iii) m > 0,  = m: it is clear from the brane diagram, shown in figure 2iii),
that the d3-brane must end on the ns5-brane and is is therefore restricted to the
interval || < m. this is the coulomb branch of the gauge theory.

iv) m > 0,  > m: there are two isolated vacua where the d3-brane ends on
one or the other d5-brane as shown in figure 2iv). these are located at  = m in
agreement with the eld theory analysis of section 2.

of the d3-brane. the top two diagrams are, from left to right, 2i) and 2ii) and the
bottom three 2iii), 2iv) and 2v). in diagram 2iii), the d3-brane is restricted to lie on
the interval as shown by the arrow.

v) m  0,  < m. in this case the d3-brane must end on one of the two dyonic
vebranes as shown in figure 2v). the corresponding vacua are located at  = .
notice that the 5-brane web encodes information about quantum eects of the
gauge theory, in particular the contribution to the renormalised fi parameter arising
from weakly gauged global symmetries (the last term in (4)). moreover, it was argued
in [17, 16] that when the d3-brane is suspended between 5-branes of dierent kinds
cs terms appear on its world-volume theory. this is again in agreement with the eld
theory dynamics whereby, for instance, in the coulomb phase described above the
d3-brane cannot move outside the interval due to dynamically generated cs terms.
in fact, one can further study the theory of section 3 with a bare cs coupling  = 1
by replacing the ns5-brane with a (1, 1)-5-brane. it is simple to see that, for  e = 0
and m 6= 0, the d3-brane may lie anywhere on one of the (1, 1)-5-branes of the web,
parametrised by the half-line. a short calculation conrms that this is in agreement
with the eld theory result.

the similarity between the 5-brane webs and toric skeletons was pointed out by
in the case of an ns5-brane above, we saw that, on the
vafa and leung [11].
coulomb branch, the d3-brane was restricted to lie on the interval of the ns5-brane:
this interval is the toric skeleton for cp1. similarly, in the case of a (1, 1)-5-brane,
the d3-brane is constrained to lie on the half-line of the (1, 1)-5-brane: this is the
toric skeleton for the complex plane. in the eld theory, using the results of section

13

3 and [5], one may see that the size of the s1 is zero at the origin of the half-line
while asympotically, where one may trust the one-loop calculation, it grows linearly,
in agreement with the proposal that the coulomb branch is indeed the complex plane.
