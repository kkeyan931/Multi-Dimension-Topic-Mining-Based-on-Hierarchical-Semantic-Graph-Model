the most general theory of gravity in d dimensions which
leads to second order eld equations for the metric has [(d 
1)/2] free parameters. it is shown that requiring the theory
to have the maximum possible number of degrees of freedom,
xes these parameters in terms of the gravitational and the
cosmological constants. in odd dimensions, the lagrangian is
a chern-simons form for the (a)ds or poincare groups. in
even dimensions, the action has a born-infeld-like form.

torsion may occur explicitly in the lagrangian in the
parity-odd sector and the torsional pieces respect local (a)ds
symmetry for d = 4k  1 only. these torsional lagrangians
are related to the chern-pontryagin characters for the (a)ds
group. the additional coecients in front of these new terms
in the lagrangian are shown to be quantized.

i. introduction

the possibility that spacetime may have more than
four dimensions is now a standard assumption in high
energy physics.. this underscores the need to critically
examine the minimal requirements for a consistent theory
of gravity in any dimension, including both general co-
variance and second order eld equations for the metric.
although many dierent approaches have been followed
in the generalizations to d > 4, most models assume the
simplest generalization of general relativity to higher di-
mensions, namely the einstein-hilbert action. the most
general action for the metric satisfying the criteria of
general covariance and second order eld equations for
d > 4 is a polynomial of degree [d/2] in the curvature1,
the lanczos-lovelock (ll) theory. the ll theory in
fact refers to a family parametrized by a set of real co-
ecients p, p = 0, 1, ..., [d/2], which are not xed from
rst principles.

in this note, it is shown these parameters are xed
in terms of the gravitational and the cosmological con-
stants, through the requirement that the theory possess
the largest possible number of degrees of freedom. as a
consequence, the action in even dimensions has a born-
infeld-like form, while in odd dimensions, the lagrangian

1here [x] represents the integer part of x.

is a chern-simons form for the (a)ds or poincare groups.
the same requirement implies that torsion may occur
explicitly in the lagrangian only for d = 4k  1. each
of these torsional lagrangians are related to the chern-
pontryagin characters for the (a)ds group, and the coef-
cients in front of them (s) are shown to be quantized.
here we adopt the rst order approach, where the in-
dependent dynamical variables are the vielbein (ea) and
the spin connection (ab), which obey rst order dier-
ential eld equations2. the standard second order form
can be obtained if the torsion equations are solved for
the connection and eliminated in favor of the vielbein 
this step however, cannot be taken in general because
the equations for ab are not invertible for dimensions
higher than four. the rst order formalism has the added
advantage that it can be expressed entirely in terms of
dierential forms and their exterior derivatives, without
ever introducing the inverse vielbein or the hodge -dual.
in the next section we review extensions of gravity the-
ory beyond the einstein-hilbert action for dimensions
greater than four (ll theory). in section iii it is shown
that in order to have the maximum possible number of
degrees of freedom, the ps must be xed in terms of the
gravitational and the cosmological constants. in section
iv the inclusion of torsion explicitly in the lagrangian
is explored. new torsional lagrangians are found, which
are related to the chern-pontryagin characters for the
(a)ds group in d = 4k  1 dimensions. section v con-
tains the discussion and summary.

ii. beyond the einstein-hilbert action

assuming the spacetime geometry as given by the
einstein-hilbert (eh) action with or without cosmolog-
ical constant is the most reasonable choice in dimensions
three and four3, but not necessarily so for d > 4. the idea
that a more general theory could be employed to describe

2the curvature and torsion two-forms are related to ea, and
ab through rab = dab + a
beb,
respectively.
3in 1 + 1 dimensions, in order to write an action principle it
is necessary supply the theory with an extra scalar eld [1,2].

the spacetime geometry in dimensions larger than four 
even in the absence of torsion was rst considered some
sixty years ago by lanczos [3]. more recently, it was ob-
served that the low energy eective lagrangian for grav-
ity obtained from string theory would have curvature-
squared terms and higher powers as well [4]. these
terms are potential sources of inconsistencies as they
would in general give rise to fourth order eld equations
and bring in ghosts. however, it was soon pointed out
by zwiebach [5] and zumino [6], that if the eective la-
grangian would contain the higher powers of curvature
in particular combinations, only second order eld equa-
tions are produced and consequently no ghosts arise. the
eective lagrangian obtained by this argument, was pre-
cisely of the form proposed by lanczos for d = 5 and, for
general d, by lovelock [7].

in a more recent context, there are further clues that
point in this direction. it is expected that the low energy
regime of m -theory should be described by an eleven-
dimensional supergravity of new type, with o-shell lo-
cal supersymmetry [8], whose lagrangian should contain
higher powers of curvature [9]. a family of supergravity
theories that satisfy these conditions has been proposed
in [1012], and the purely gravitational sector of those
theories is an extension of ordinary eh gravity, as de-
scribed below.

a. first order formalism

in standard general relativity, the metric is viewed
as the fundamental eld, while the ane structure of
spacetime (connection) is assumed to be a derived con-
cept. the link between the two structures is the vanish-
ing of the torsion tensor, which is often imposed as an
identical, o-shell requirement for the connection. con-
sequently, the spin connection has no independent, prop-
agating degrees of freedom and the spacetime torsion is
not dynamically determined but constrained by at.

a purely metric formulation would be insucient for
the description of spinor elds because they couple the
antisymmetric part of the ane connection, and there-
fore they are sources for the torsion. hence, in a theory
with fundamental spinors coupled to gravity, it is neces-
sary that the metric and ane properties of spacetime be
treated separately. moreover, considering the fact that
spinors provide a basis of irreducible representations for
so(d  1, 1) (lorentzd), but not for gl(d), they must be
dened on a local frame on the tangent space rather than
in relation to a coordinate system on the base manifold.
thus, in a theory containing fermions, it is more natu-
ral to look for a formulation of gravity in which ab and
ea are dynamically independent, with curvature and tor-
sion standing on similar footing. the rst order formal-
ism oers exactly this possibility. indeed, when torsion is
not set equal to zero, the standard variational principles
rst, second and 1.5 order are no longer necessarily

equivalent. for example, varying the action with respect
to ea  in the 1.5 order formalism [13], yields

i =

i
ea ea +

i
bc

bc
ea ea,

which would reduce to the einstein equations (second or-
der formalism) provided i
bc = 0. thus, in particular, in
the presence of spinors these formalisms would be dier-
ent because in the second order case, the torsion equation
is imposed as a constraint, but this is in fact a matter of
choice.

in three and four dimensions, allowing ab and ea to
be dynamically independent does not modify the stan-
dard picture in practice because any occurrence of tor-
sion in the action leads to torsion-free classical solutions
(in vacuum)4.
in higher dimensions, however, theories
that include torsion explicitly in the lagrangian, can-
not be related, even perturbatively, to their torsion-free
counterparts [14].

b. higher dimensional gravity: lanczos-lovelock

theory

the main fundamental assumptions in standard gen-
eral relativity are the requirements of general covariance
and that the eld equations for the metric be second or-
der. based on the same principles, the ll lagrangian is
dened as the most general d-form invariant under local
lorentz transformations, constructed with the vielbein,
the spin connection, and their exterior derivatives, with-
out using the hodge dual5 [6,15,16].

the ll lagrangian is a polynomial of degree [d/2] in

the curvature,

ig =z

[d/2]

xp=0

pl(p),

(1)

where p are arbitrary constants, and

l(p) = a1adra1a2    ra2p1a2pea2p+1    ead.

(2)

here and in the sequel wedge product of forms is implic-
itly understood.

the rst two terms in (1) are the eh action. although
general relativity is contained in the ll action as a par-
ticular case, theories with higher powers of curvature are
dynamically very dierent from eh, whose classical so-
lutions are not even perturbatively related to those of

4in the case of coupling to spinning matter, the torsion equa-
tions allow expressing ab in terms of ea and the matter elds.
5avoiding the hogde dual guarantees that the elds ab and
ea that extremize the action obey rst order equations.

2

einsteins theory. however, to lowest order in perturba-
tion theory around a at, torsion-free background, all of
the l(p)s dened in (2) with p  2 are total derivatives
[6].

the [(d + 1)/2] dimensionful constants p in the ll
action contrast with the two constants of the eh theory
(g and ). in the following section the ps are selected
according to the criterion that the integrability (or con-
sistency) conditions for the eld equations should not
impose additional algebraic constraints on the curvature
and torsion tensors. this guarantees that the elds at-
tain the maximum number of degrees of freedom allowed
by the spacetime dimension.

iii. consistency of the first order

formalism

consider the ll action (1), as a functional of the spin
connection and the vielbein, ig = ig[ab, ea]. varying
with respect to these elds, the following eld equations
are obtained,

ea  ea = 0,
ab  eab = 0,

where we have dened

[ d1
2 ]

ea :=

p(d  2p)e p
a ,

[ d1

xp=0
xp=1

eab :=

and

pp(d  2p)e p

e p

(7)

e p
ab  aba3adra3a4    ra2p1a2pt a2p+1ea2p+2    ead.

(8)

the (d  1)-forms ea and eab are independent lorentz
tensors with the same number of components as the elds
ea and ab, respectively. if there were algebraic relations
among these tensors, so that (3) and (4) would not be
independent, then the elds ab and ea would not be
completely determined by their eld equations and initial
conditions. on the other hand, it is easy to check that
by virtue of the bianchi identities (drab = 0, dt a =
ra

beb), the following relations hold

de p

a = (d  2p  1)ebe p+1
ba ,

(9)

dea 

[ d+1
2 ]

xp=1

p1(d  2p + 2)(d  2p + 1)ebe p
ba,

(10)

which by consistency with (3) must also vanish. more-
over, taking the exterior product of (6) with eb gives

ebeba 

[ d1
2 ]

xp=1

pp(d  2p)ebe p
ba,

(11)

which vanishes by virtue of (4).

comparing the last two identities, one can see that
if the coecients p were generic, equations (3) and (4)
would imply in general additional restrictions of the form
ebe p
ba = 0 for some ps. this in turn would imply that
some components of the torsion tensor must vanish, freez-
ing out some degrees of freeom in the theory, and at the
same time, leaving other components of the curvature
and torsion tensors are left undetermined by the eld
equations. thus, dierent choices of ps correspond, in
general, to theories with dierent numbers of physical
degrees of freedom depending on how many additional
o-shell constraints are imposed on the geometry by the
last identities.

as we show next, among all the possible choices, there
is a very special one which occurs only in odd dimen-
sions, for which there are no additional constraints. in
even dimensions, this possibility does not exist; in fact,
equations (10) and (11) are proportional to each other
term by term for d = 2n  1 but for d = 2n, both equa-
tions have dierent number of terms. we will treat each
case separately.

a. d = 2n  1: local (a)ds chern-simons gravity

in odd dimensions, equations (10) and (11) have the
same number of terms because the last term in (10) van-
ishes. thus, if equations (10) and (11) are to imposse
no further algebraic constraints on rab and t a, the two
series dea and ebeba must be proportional term by term:

p1(d  2p + 2)(d  2p + 1)ebe p

ba = pp(d  2p)ebe p
ba,

which implies the following recursion relation for the ps



p
p+1

=

(p + 1)(d  2p  2)
(d  2p)(d  2p  1)

(12)

where 0  p  n  1, and  is an arbitrary constant of
dimension [length2]. the solution of this equation is

p = 0

(2n  1)(2)p

p (cid:19) .
(2n  2p  1) (cid:18) n  1

(13)

for 0  p  [(d  1)/2], which leads to the following
o-shell identity

thus, the action contains only two fundamental con-
stants, 0 and , related to the gravitational and the

(14)

choosing the coecients p as in (13), implies that the
action is invariant not only under standard local lorentz
beb and ab = dab), but also
rotations (ea = a
under local ads boosts,

ea = da

ab =

1
l2 (aeb  bea).

(15)

this can be seen because the lagrangian in (1) with
the choice of coecients (13) is the euler-chern-simons
form for so(d  1, 2), that is, its exterior derivative is
the euler form in 2n dimensions e2n,

for even dimensions, equation (10) has one more term
than (11). therefore, both series cannot be compared
term by term and one must follow a dierent route. it
can be noted that equation (4) is an exterior covariant
derivative,

denes the lie algebra valued ads curvature f =

equations (3) and (4) can be cast as dierent components
of a single ads covariant equation

2 wabjab = 1

(18)

which transforms as a tensor under local ads gauge
transformations which include (15), wab = ab,
where  is the exterior covariant derivative in the ads
connection. considering this, the consistency condition
ebeba = dea does not produce additional constraints,
because it is just a component of the identity

eab  0,

(19)

which is trivially satised by virtue of the ads bianchi
identity,  rab = 0.

6for any dimension, l is a length parameter related to the
cosmological constant by  =  (d1)(d2)
. in the following
we will choose the negative sign, but the analysis does not
depend on it. here, the gravitational constant g is related to
 through 1 = 2(d  2)!d2g (see ref. [17]).

this equation can be compared with the second identity

(26)

both (20) and (26) can be zero either if t a = 0, or
tab = 0. however, those are excessive conditions for the
vanishing of (25). it is sucient to impose the weaker
conditions t atab = 0, and at the same time that the sec-
ond term in (25) be proportional to the series in (26).
now, both series possess the same number of terms, and
therefore the solution which allows the maximum num-
ber of degrees of freedom is the one for which both series
are equal term by term, up to a global factor. hence, one
obtains the following recursion relation for the ps:

2(n  p + 1)p1 = pp,

(27)

for some xed . with this relation, equation (25) reads,

4

dea =

1


(t btab  ebeab) = 0,

(28)

c. dynamical behavior

and therefore it is apparent that if t a is just a null vector
of tab, both consistency conditions are the same.

the solution of the recursion relation (27) is

p (cid:19) ,
p = 0(2)p(cid:18) n

(29)

with 0  p  n  1. this formula can be extended to
p = n at no extra cost, because it only amounts to adding
the euler density to the lagrangian with the weight n =
0(2)n.

the action depends only on the gravitational and the
cosmological constants, as in odd dimensions, given by
(14). the choice of coecients (29) implies that the la-
grangian takes the form

l =


2n

a1ad

ra1a2    rad1ad,

(30)

which is the pfaan of the 2-form rab = rab + 1
l2 eaeb,
and can be formally written as the born-infeld (bi)-like
form [20],

l = 2n1(n  1)!sdet(cid:18)rab +

1

l2 eaeb(cid:19).

(31)

in four dimensions (31) reduces to a particular linear
combination of the einstein-hilbert action, the cosmolog-
ical constant and the euler density. although this last
term does not contribute to the eld equations, it plays
an important role in the denition of conserved charges
for gravitation theories in dimensions 2n  4 [21,22,17].

the eld equations (3) and (4), now take the form

ea  ab1bd1
ab  aba3ad

rb1b2    rbd3bd2ebd1 = 0,
ra3a4    rad3ad2t ad1ead = 0.

(32)

one could consider sectors of the phase space for which

tab =


2

aba3ad

ra3a4    rad1ad = 0,

(33)

which solves the eld equations (32) identically without
requiring t a = 0.

the two-form rab is a piece of the ads curvature (17).
this fact seems to suggest that the system might be nat-
urally described in terms of an ads connection (see, e.g.,
[23]). however, that is incorrect: in even dimensions, the
lagrangian (30) is invariant under local lorentz transfor-
mations and not under the entire ads group. in contrast,
as shown above, it is possible to construct gauge invari-
ant theories of gravity under the full ads group in odd
dimensions.

as shown above, unlike in the eh theory, the eld
equations of bi and cs theories do not imply the van-
ishing of torsion in absence of matter. on the contrary,
assuming t a = 0 as a constraint links the transformation
of the spin connection with that of the vielbein,

ab =

ab
ec ec.

(34)

this dynamical dependence between ab and ea, spoils
the possibility of interpreting the local ads boosts  or
local translational invariance, in the   0 limit  as
a gauge symmetry of the action. thus, the spin con-
nection and the vielbein the soldering between the base
manifold and the tangent space cannot be identied as
the compensating elds for local lorentz rotations and
ads boosts, respectively. hence, gravitation can be real-
ized as a truly gauge theory with ber bundle structure,
where ab and ea are connection elds only if the torsion
is not xed to zero. as shown above, this possibility is
fully realized in odd dimensions for the cs lagrangian
only.

2

for a generic ll theory, when torsion is set equal to
zero, the number of degrees of freedom is the same as
in the eh theory, namely d(d3)
[16]. these degrees of
freedom correspond to the components of the vielbein
that remain after xing the local lorentz and dieo-
morphism invariances. on the other hand, cs theory
in d = 2n  1 without assuming vanishing torsion has
(n  1)(2n2  5n + 1) additional degrees of freedom [24].
these extra local degrees of freedom cannot be excita-
tions described by the vielbein, because the gauge sym-
metry of the theory can be used to gauge away d(d+3)
of its components, just like in the non-cs case. hence,
the extra degrees of freedom must be carried by the con-
torsion tensor kab := ab  ab(e), where ab(e) is the
solution of t a = 0.

2

in view of the preceding analysis, there seems to be
no reason to exclude torsion from the lagrangian itself.
in the next section we explore the possibility of adding
torsion explicitly to the action.

iv. adding torsion explicitly in the

lagrangian

the generalization of the lanczos-lovelock theory to
include torsion explicitly is obtained assuming the la-
grangian to be the most general d-form constructed with
the vielbein and the spin connection without using the
hodge dual, and invariant under local lorentz transfor-
mations. a constructive algorithm to produce all possible
local lorentz invariants from ea, rab and t a is given in
ref. [14]. as with the ll lagrangian, the explicit inclu-
sion of torsional terms brings in a number of arbitrary
dimensionful coecients k analogous to the ps.

5

the aim of this section is to show that in certain di-
mensions the s can be suitably chosen so as to enlarge
the local lorentz invariance into the ads gauge symme-
try7.

if no additional structure (e.g., inverse metric, hodge
dual (), etc.) is assumed, ads invariant integrals can
only be produced in 4k and 4k  1 dimensions. this can
be seen as follows: as is well-known (see, e.g., [25]), in
2n dimensions, the only 2n-forms invariant under so(n )
constructed in terms of the so(n ) curvature are the
euler density for n = 2n only, and the n-th chern
characters for any n . an important dierence between
these invariants is that the euler form is even under par-
ity transformations, while the latter is odd. parity is
dened by the sign change induced by a simultaneous
inversion of one coordinate in the tangent space and in
the base manifold. thus, for instance the euler density,
e2n = a1a2n ra1a2    ra2n1a2n , is even under parity,
while the lorentz chern classes, ra1
a1 , and the
b2
torsional invariants such as eara

bt b are parity odd.

   ra2n

in the previous section we discussed all possible la-
grangians of the form [r]p[e]d2p. in what follows we
concentrate on the construction of the pure gravity sec-
tor as a gauge theory which is parity-odd. that sector
is described by lagrangians containing lorentz-invariant
products of the elds and their exterior derivatives, which
do not contain the lorentz levi-civita symbol a1ad.
this construction was sketched through briey in the
context of supergravity in refs. [26,10,12].

lemma 2: for d = 4k + 2, there are no parity-odd
so(d+1)-invariant d-forms constructed from ea, rab and
t a.

since the expressions pr1rs in (35) are 4k-dimensional
closed forms, they are at best boundary terms which do
not contribute to the classical equations (although they
would assign dierent phases to congurations with non-
trivial torsion in the quantum theory). in view of this,
it is clear why attempts to construct purely gravitational
theories with local ads invariance in even dimensions
have proven unsuccessful in spite of several serious ef-
forts [23,27].

the form pr1rs can be expressed locally as the exte-

rior derivative of a (4k  1)-form,

pr1rs = dlads

t 4k1(a).

(37)

this implies that for each collection {r1,    rs}, lads
t 4k1
is a good lagrangian for the ads group (so(4k)) in 4k1
dimensions. in a given dimension, the most general la-
grangian of this sort is a linear combination of all pos-
sible lads
it can be directly checked that these
lagrangians necessarily involve torsion explicitly.

t 4k1s.

these results can be summarized in the following

theorem:

there
are two families of rst-order gravitational lagrangians
l(e, ), invariant under local ads transformations:

in odd-dimensional spacetimes,

in even dimensions the only ads-invariant d-forms are,
apart from the euler density, linear combinations of prod-
ucts of the type

pr1rs = cr1    crs,

with 2(r1 + r2 +    + rs) = d. here

cr = tr(f)r,

(35)

(36)

denes the rth chern character of so(n ). now, since the
curvature two-form f is in the vector representation it is
antisymmetric in the group indices. thus, the powers rj
in (36) are necessarily even, and therefore (35) vanishes
unless d is a multiple of four. these results can be sum-
marized in the following lemmas:

lemma 1: for d = 4k, the only parity-odd d-forms
invariant under the ads

built from ea, rab and t a,
group, are the chern characters for so(d + 1).

7here so(d) and so(d  1, 1) will be used indistinguishably
to represent the lorentz group in d dimensions, while the d-
dimensional (a)ds group will be denoted by so(d  1, 2),
so(d, 1) or so(d + 1), since the analysis that follows is in-
sensitive to the signature.

it must be stressed that locally ads-invariant gravity
theories exist only in odd dimensions. they are genuine
gauge systems, whose action comes from topological in-
variants in d+1 dimensions. these topological invariants
can be written as the trace of a homogeneous polynomial
of degree n in the ads curvature. in summary, for di-
mensions 4k  1 both a- and b-families exist, and for
d = 4k + 1 only the a- family appears

a. examples for d = 2n

in d = 4, the only local lorentz-invariant 4-forms con-

structed with the recipe just described are:

e4 = abcdrabrcd
leh = abcdrabeced
l = abcdeaebeced

c2 = ra
brb
a
lt1 = rabeaeb
lt2 = t ata.

the rst three terms are even under parity and the
rest are odd. of these, e4 and c2 are topological invariant
densities (closed forms): the euler density and the second
chern character for so(4), respectively. the remaining
four terms dene the most general pure gravity action in
four dimensions,

i =zm4

[leh + l + lt1 + lt2 ] .

(38)

the rst two terms can be combined with e4 into the
born-infeld form (31) which is locally invariant under
lorentz, but not under ads. it can also be seen that if
 = , the last two terms are combined into a topo-
logical invariant density, the nieh-yan form [28]. this
choice implies that the entire odd part of the action be-
comes a boundary term. furthermore, c2, lt1 and lt2
can be combined into the second chern character of the
ads group,

ra

brb

a +

2
l2 (t ata  rabeaeb) = ra

b

rb
a.

(39)

the form (39) is the only ads invariant constructed
just with ea, ab and their exterior derivatives, and there-
fore there are no locally ads-invariant gravity theories in
four dimensions.

in view of lemmas (1) and (2), the corresponding ads-
invariant functionals in higher dimensions can be written
in terms of the ads curvature as linear combinations of
terms like

ir1rs =zm

cr1    crs,

(40)

where cr =tr[( ra
b)r] is the r-th chern character for the
ads group, and dim(m ) = r1 +    + rs is a multiple of
four. for example, in d = 8 the chern characters are

c4 = tr[( ra

b)4],

and

(c2)2 = tr[( ra

b)2]tr[( ra

b)2].

(41)

(42)

b. examples for d = 2n  1

the simplest example occurs in three dimensions,
where there are two locally ads invariant lagrangians,
namely, the einstein-hilbert with cosmological constant,

and the exotic lagrangian [29]

(43)

(44)

(45)

the lagrangians (43, 44, 45) are the euler, the pon-
tryagin and the lorentz chern-simons forms, respec-
tively. the most general action for gravitation in d = 3,
which is invariant under ads is therefore the linear com-
bination lads

g 3 + lads
t 3 .

for d = 4k  1, the number of possible exotic forms
grows as the number of elements of the partition set (k)
of k, in correspondence with the number of composite
chern invariants of the form:

p{rj } = yrj (k)

crj .

(46)

thus, the most general lagrangian in 4k1 dimensions

takes the form

lads

g 4k1 + {rj }lads

t {rj } 4k1,

(47)

t {rj } 4k1 = pr1rs, with pj rj = 4k. these

lagrangians are not boundary terms and, unlike the

example, in seven dimensions one nds

where l

2n1 is the lorentz-cs (2n  1)-form,

(48)

the corresponding integrals i4 and i2,2 are topological
invariants that characterize the maps so(9)  m8. fur-
thermore, as already mentioned, ir1rs vanishes if one of
the rs happens to be odd, which is the case in 4k + 2
dimensions. thus, one concludes that there are no tor-
sional ads-invariant gauge theories for gravity in even
dimensions.

it should be noted that the coecients  and {rj }
are arbitrary and dimensionless. as is shown in the next
section, these coecients must be quantized by an exten-
sion of the argument used to prove that  in (16) is also
quantized [30]. we now extend that argument to show
that the s in (47) are also quantized.

7

c. quantization of parameters

consider the action for the connection a on a (2n1)-
dimensional, compact, oriented, simply connected man-
ifold m without boundary, which is the boundary of an
oriented (2n)-dimensional manifold . by stokes theo-
rem, the action for (47) can be written as an integral on
,

i ads

 [a] =z(cid:0)e2n + {r}p{r}(cid:1) .

(49)

(for d = 4k + 1 the last term is absent as the p{r}s
vanish). i ads
 [a] describes a topological eld theory on
 for a which should be insensitive to the change of  by
another orientable manifold  with the same boundary,
i.e.,  = m = . thus we have

i ads
 [a] = i ads



[a] +z(cid:0)e2n + {r}p{r}(cid:1) ,

(50)

where the orientation of  has been reversed. now,  :=
   is a closed oriented manifold formed by joining 
and  continuously along m . then (50) can be written
as

i ads
 [a] = i ads



[a] + [] + {rj}p{rj}[],

(51)

where p{r} =r p{rj }.

substituting i by i would have no eect in the path
integral for the quantum theory provided the dierence
[] = ii is an integer multiple of plancks constant
h which, in addition, cannot change under continuous
deformations of the elds. thus, we have

[] = [] + {rj }p{rj }[]

(52)

= mh.

now, since the euler and the pontryagin numbers []
and p{rj }[] are integers, the coecients  and {rj } are
necessarily quantized.

the preceding argument is rigorously valid for a
if m is locally
manifold with euclidean signature.
minkowskian one can apply the same reasoning to the
analytic continuation of the path integral in which the
base manifold m and its tangent bundle t (m ) are si-
multaneously wick-rotated. this has the eect that the
group of rotations on t (m ) may have nontrivial homo-
topy group, 2n1[so(2n)] so that the chern characters
can be nonzero.

v. discussion and summary

1. exact solutions

some interesting spacetimes of negative constant curva-
ture are topological black holes of refs. [31]. further-
more, for each dimension, there is a unique static, spher-
ically symmetric, asymptotically ads black hole solution
[19], as well as their topological extensions [32]. simi-
larly, friedman-robertson-walker cosmologies have also
been found [33].

torsional ads-invariant terms can be coupled only for
cs theory in 4k  1 dimensions. the contributions of
these terms to the eld equations, vanish identically for
the solutions just mentioned but not for all solutions.

2. local ads symmetry and geometric equivalence

it may be stressed that the eld equations in the cs
case, with or without torsional terms, are manifestly lo-
cally ads-covariant, which gives rise to a paradoxical sit-
uation: under the action of an ads transformation which
is not contained in the lorentz subgroup (15), the cur-
vature and torsion tensors transform as:

 rab =

1
l2 (at b  bt a),

t a =  ra

bb.

(53)

thus, in general, a solution with non-vanishing ads
curvature and zero torsion can be mapped into another
one with torsion. these solutions are not dieomorphi-
cally equivalent to each other. in fact, the metric trans-
forms under (15) as

g = g  ea(t a

),

(54)

where  stands for a dieomorphism whose parameter
satises a = ea
. this implies that in the presence of
torsion, the new metric is in general not dieomorphic to
the old one. furthermore, even if there is no torsion to
begin with, by virtue of (54) the new metric will eventu-
ally be dieomorphically inequivalent to higher order in
a.

at rst glance, it would seem that these two solutions
should be physically inequivalent; in fact, these solutions
have dierent geodesic structure. the apparent paradox
stems from the fact that the geodesic equation is lorentz
covariant, but not ads covariant. the crucial point, is
what one means by physically equivalent. the situ-
ation is analogous to the transformation of the electro-
magnetic eld under a lorentz boost: e and b elds
transform, and even if one start with a purely magnetic
(electric) conguration, to second order in (v/c) one nds
both.

3. string-induced gravity

it is apparent from the eld equations for cs and bi
theories (18,32), that any locally ads spacetime is a so-
lution for them. apart from anti-de sitter space itself,

in the context of string theory, as shown in [5,6], the
ll action is the only ghost free candidate for a low

8

energy gravitational eective theory. this is a conse-
quence of the fact that this are the only theories which
gives rise second order eld equations for the metric. on
the other hand, it has been argued that the on-shell s-
matrix is unchanged under metric redenitions g 
g + r + r [34], which changes completely the
polynomial structure of the eective lagrangian. this
in general brings in ghosts, and worst yet, modies the
dynamical structure of the classical theory: the new eld
equations are fourth order, and they no longer pose a well
dened cauchy problem and spoils the causality features.
on the other hand, similar eld redenitions of the
form a  a(a) are not acceptable in gauge theories
since this would severely damage gauge invariance, spoil-
ing essential features of the quantum theory. in the ab-
sence of a quantum theory of gravity, there seems to be
no way to x the form of the action completely unless the
theory could be formulated as a gauge theory with ber
bundle structure. this is precisely the case for the cs
gravity theories, whose simplest example occurs in 2 + 1
dimensions. although this gauge invariance of 2+1 grav-
ity is not always emphasized, it lies at the heart of the
proof of integrability of the theory [29]. higher dimen-
sional cs actions have no dimensionful constants when
written in terms of the ads connection, so that the elds
have canonical dimension 1 and the action describes a
bona de ads gauge system. the corresponding quan-
tum theory as well as its local supersymmetric extensions
would be renormalizable by power counting and possibly
nite [30].

4. supergravity

the analysis of stability and positivity of the energy
for these theories is a nontrivial problem. however some
insights can be gained from the supersymmetric exten-
sion of the cs theory, for which, the expectation val-
ues of dierent charges should be related by bogomolnyi
bounds. the supersymmetric extension of gravity theo-
ries described here for d = 4k  1 was discussed in [10],
and in general for d = 2n  1, in [11,12]. the resulting
supergravity theories are locally invariant under the su-
persymmetric extensions of ads, so that supersymmetry
is realized in the ber rather than on the base mani-
fold8. a key point in that construction is that super-
symmetry requires the inclusion of torsional terms from
the start, which justies considering such terms in the
purely bosonic theory. the possible connection between
the new eleven dimensional supergravity and m-theory

is an open problem, as can be readily inferred from a
cursory review of refs. [3642].

the rst example of a supergravity action containing
the ll-action was worked out by chamseddine in ve
dimensions [18]. this construction, however cannot be
generalized to arbitrary higher odd dimensions unless tor-
sional terms are introduced in the gravitational sector.

one can show that, around an appropriate back-
ground, the conserved charges satisfy a central extension
of the super ads algebra, which leads to a bogomolnyi
bound on the bosonic charges. as usual, solutions with
killing spinors saturate the bound9.

in d = 2n  1, one should expect the existence of
a new kind of 2n-dimensional theory at the boundary.
that theory should be constructed on the generalization
of the centrally extended gauge algebra, which can be
viewed as the superconformal algebra at the boundary10.
these theories should be a rich arena to test the recently
conjectured ads/cft correspondence [43].

5. summary

in sum, it was shown that requiring ll theories to
have the maximum possible number of degrees of free-
dom, xes their [(d  1)/2] free parameters in terms of
the gravitational and the cosmological constants. fol-
lowing this criterion, the selected theories fall into two
families. in even dimensions, torsion can be assumed to
be a null vector of tab dened in (33), which is in gen-
eral much weaker than imposing t a = 0 by at, so that
the resulting theory has a born-infeld form. in odd di-
mensions, torsion needs not be constrained at all in the
theory, and the action can be written as a cs form. in
that case, the vielbein and the spin connection can be
viewed as dierent components of an (a)ds or poincare
connection, so that its local symmetry is enlarged from
lorentzd to (a)dsd (or poincare when  = 0) [44].

the existence of propagating degrees of freedom 
associated with the spacetime contorsion kab, makes
it natural to look at the parity -odd sector of the the-
ory, which implies to consider torsional terms explicitly
in the lagrangian. the explicit inclusion of torsional
terms brings in a number of new arbitrary dimension-
ful coecients {r} analogous to the ps in the ll la-
grangian. it was shown that s can be suitably chosen
so as to enlarge the local lorentz invariance into the ads
gauge symmetry. in that case, torsion may occur explic-
itly in the lagrangian in the parity-odd sector and for
d = 4k  1 only. these torsional lagrangians are related
to the chern-pontryagin characters for the (a)ds group.

8an exceptionally simple case occurs when the coecients
p in the theory are chosen so that the bosonic system is
locally poincare invariant. the supersymmetric extension was
constructed in ref. [35].

9the ve-dimensional case was analyzed partially in [36]
10we thank marc henneaux for fruitful discussions about
this point.

9

thus, for d = 4k  1, the most general theory which al-
low the existence of independent propagating degrees of
freedom for the contorsion, has a new set of parameters
the {r}s, which are shown to be quantized.
