(this set eigenvalues specic example (4.19).) supersymmetric solutions, mass/charge relations given e p5 + p5 + p2 + pw = q2 (q5 + q5) qw , q2 (q5 q5) qw . (4.21) remaining 8 possibilities, eigenvalues given 2(p2, p5, p5, p5 + p5 + p2, p2 + pw, p5 + pw, p5 + pw, p5 + p5 + p2 + pw) , (4.22) hence solutions break supersymmetry charges non-vanishing. non-supersymmetric solutions mass/charge relations given e p5 + p5 + p2 + pw = q2 (q5 q5) qw , q2 (q5 + q5) qw . (4.23) naively, might seem could achieve dierent, sometimes unusual, fractions unbroken supersymmetry making certain special non-vanishing choices (p5, p5, p2, pw) parameters. example, choosing p5 = p5 = p2, pw = 0, (4.20), could appar- ently get 24 zero eigenvalues hence 3 4 preserved supersymmetry. hand, saw indication explicit solutions killing spinors supersymmetry enhancements could occur special values charges.3 3we remark stage obtained conditions (4.7) existence killing spinors assuming functions h, eh, k w proportional one another. crucial appreciate quantities p5, p5, p2 pw precisely coecients appearing functions, possibility two functions proportional kinds cases considering here, one p coecients negative other. 13 resolution puzzle, discussed , occurrence zero eigenvalues anticommutator supercharges sometimes give false impression existence additional killing spinors, encountered precisely example. reason supercharge argument unreliable order achieve extra zeroes (4.19) necessary least one contributions (p5, p5, p2, pw) appear energy (4.17) negative. means associated harmonic function negative asymptotic coecient, hence means naked singularity metric region. circumstances, assumed conditions one derives relation zeroes anticommutator (4.12) unbroken supersymmetry generators violated, one cannot trust result. fact additional killing spinors actually arise, seen earlier explicit calculation, shows indeed happened case. 4.2 heterotic theory perspective study fractions preserved supersymmetry heterotic theory, use killing-spinor calculations before, impose additional ten-dimensional chirality condition killing spinor, 0 = # 0 . (4.24) (of course might instead impose condition minus sign, depending conventions.) thus number independent components unbroken supersymmetry determined solving equations (4.9), together (4.24). usual, charges (4.9) zero, associated condition omitted. rather stating results various supersymmetry fractions here, convenient rst give discussion anticommutator supercharges heterotic case. previous m-theory discussion, nd two approaches agree, provided discard apparent supersymmetry enhancements would naively appear occur {q, q} eigenvalue calculation negative energy contributions. since concerned contributions yang-mills elds anticommutator algebra {q, q}, make use formalism (4.12) = 11, additional requirement project matrices onto positive eigenspace chirality operator #. (4.15), see gamma matrix conventions using # given # = diag(1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1) 1l4 . (4.25) 14 projection onto positive eigenspace # therefore amounts keeping 1st, 3rd, 5th 7th entries (4.16). turns 4 possible 16 sign choices (q5, q5, q2, qw) = (p5, p5, p2, pw) obtain eigenvalues = 2(0, p5 + p2, p5 + p2 + pw, p5 + p5) , (4.26) {q, q}, degeneracy 4. expression summarises information possible supersymmetry fractions achieved; usual, quantities (p5, p5, p2, pw) considered non-negative. various supersymmetry frac- tions implied taking possible non-zero subsets (p5, p5, p2, pw) agree completely obtained explicitly solving killing-spinor equations. mass/charge relation supersymmetric solutions given e p5 + p5 + p2 + pw = (q2 + qw) (q5 + q5) , (q2 + qw) (q5 q5) . (4.27) note 12 possible sign choices (q5, q5, q2, qw) = (p5, p5, q2, qw) divide three sets 4, set leading eigenvalues follows: = (p5 + p2, p5 + p2, pw, p5 + p5 + pw) , = (p2, p5 + pw, p5 + pw, p5 + p5 + p2) , (4.28) = (p5, p5, p2 + pw, p5 + p5 + p2 + pw) . thus four charges turned on, none sets gives rise preserved supersymmetry. note also make opposite sign choice chirality pro- jection, sets eigenvalues (4.26) (4.28) occur, dierent combinations sign choice (q5, q5, q2, qw) = (p5, p5, q2, qw) associated set eigenvalues. example provides another manifestation supersymmetry rule obtained {$9708055$}. namely, new intersecting ingredient introduced set intersections, breaks half supersymmetry structure eigenvalues {q, q} independent sign new charge. if, hand, introduction new charge break supersymmetry further, would break supersymmetry completely instead introduced opposite sign. thus n intersecting objects preserve 1/2n supersymmetry n n , 2n 2n possible choices solutions supersymmetric rest non-supersymmetric. finally, discussion supersymmetry heterotic framework, examine situation include yang-mills elds, consider solutions h 15 eh non-singular functions yang-mills instanton sources, given (3.7). supersymmetry transformation rule gravitino unchanged one n = 1 truncation type ii theory, previous calculation supersymmetry gravitino sector goes unchanged.

(4.29) now, ga ij self-dual anti-self-dual, shall therefore nd killing spinors satisfy respectively, similar conclusions ~z space . equivalently, express (ij 1 2 ijk k) = 0 (4.30) conditions = 1234 , = 5678 . (4.31) bearing mind also chirality condition (4.24) (or opposite), see conditions (4.31) form ones already encountered (4.11). thus question whether solutions supersymmetric comes issue achieving proper correlation signs, self-duality anti-self-duality choice yang-mills instantons correlated chirality sign convention spinors heterotic theory. provided signs properly chosen, preserved supersymmetry fractions yang-mills instanton-supported solutions heterotic theory corresponding singular-source limits. 4.3 comments previous discussion demonstrated correspondence counting zero-eigenvalues anticommutator {q, q} counting killing spinors holds energy contribution intersecting ingredient non-negative. one cannot trust additional zero-eigenvalues arise virtue negative-energy contributions intersecting ingredients. emphasised, however, one always get wrong conclusion {q, q} calculation negative-energy contributions. example, simple extremal p-brane solution preserving 1 2 supersymmetry analogous result {q, q} = 2(0, p)1l16, correctly implies continue 16 unbroken components supersymmetry even 16 mass taken negative. (the killing spinor equation continues admit 16 solutions, even one sets mass negative.) {q, q} calculation giving correct conclusion wrong reason mass negative. hand, seems cases appear enhanced supersymmetry fractions particular tuned sets charges involve negative-energy contributions, conclusion always wrong. although killing spinor solutions still exist even intersecting ingredient contributes negative energy, behavior killing spinor become singular. see this, recall killing spinor solution (4.8) holds regardless detailed structure harmonic functions k, h, eh w . intersecting ingredient positive energy, harmonic functions take values 1 , hence killing spinors nite. hand, intersecting object contributes negative energy, associated harmonic function takes values 1 0, naked singularity occurring latter value. seen (4.8), killing spinor blows naked singularity. examples, requiring regularity killing spinor leads positive energy contribution, turn implies cosmic censorship {$9205027$}. however, observed {$9711089$}, 5-brane negative mass supported yang-mills instanton sucient scale size, previous singularity metric smeared instanton, hence killing spinor also well-behaved. case, continued violation relation zero-eigenvalue counting {q, q} counting killing spinors caused fact energy-momentum tensor yang-mills instanton elds violates positive-energy condition {$9711089$}. n intersecting objects preserve 1/2n supersymmetry, eigenvalues anticommutator {q, } form = (e p1 pn ) = 2(0, p1, p2, . . . , pn , p1 + p2, p1 + p3, . . . , p1 + pn ) , (4.32) total energy e = pi pi. thus anticommutator {q, q} would negative eigenvalues objects contributes negative energy. hand, n intersecting objects preserve 1/2n supersymmetry n < n , {q, q} still remain positive even individual energy contributions negative, since cases, individual energy contributions appear isolation eigenvalues. example, eigenvalues (4.19) remain non-negative even set q2 + q5 = 0. phenomenon observed {$9604035$} context 4-charge black holes four- dimensional heterotic string theory, eigenvalues {q, q} 2{0, p1 + p2, p3 + p4, p1 + p2 + p3 + p4} energy e = p1 + p2 + p3 + p4. thus one obtain 17 massless black hole setting p1 + p2 = 0 p3 + p4 = 0, without negative eigenvalues. another example literature dyonic string n = 1 supergravity, {q, q} eigenvalues 2{0, p1 + p2}, energy e = p1 + p2 . follows dyonic string becomes tensionless p1 + p2 = 0. (of course usual, one take occurrence extra zero-eigenvalues limits indicating enhanced supersymmetry.) seems solutions massless ones, negative eigenvalues occur {q, q}, may solid relation states quantum theory ones masslessness achieved price negative eigenvalues. present case paper, m-theory perspective, choice parameters energy e = p5 + ep5 + p2 + pw vanishes eigenvalues associated anticommutator (4.19) remain positive. hand, heterotic perspective eigenvalues superalgebra truncated (4.26), hence possible obtain massless solution purely non-negative eigenvalues associated superalgebra. course achieving massless solution requires negative-energy contributions intersecting ingredients, hence either killing spinor blows up, yang-mills energy density becomes negative. pathology may imply phase transition type discussed . 5 near-horizon structure single-center conguration, solutions equations (3.5) taken be: k = (1 + h = 1 + 2qe r2 )(1 + 2(r2 + 2a2) (r2 + a2)2 2q e 2 ) , w = (1 + 2qw r2 )(1 + 2q w 2 ) , , eh = 1 + 2(2 + 2b2) (2 + b2)2 , (5.1) r2 = yiyi 2 = zmzm. b sizes instantons supporting 5-branes. let us consider happens two instanton sizes b vanish. situation, functions h eh become harmonic functions. let us consider horizon region r 0 r/ non-vanishingly nite. region, additive constants 1 two functions h eh dropped. also k 4qeq e/(r2 2). region dilaton scalar becomes constant, metric becomes (for simplicity, consider qeq e = 1) ds2 10 = ds2 4 + 2d2 3 + 2de2 3 , 18 (5.2) d2 3 metrics unit 3-spheres, 3 de2 4 = 1 ds2 4 r2 2 (w 1 dt2 + w (dx + (w 1 1) dt)2) + 2dr2 r2 + 2d2 2 . four-dimensional conguration (5.3) solution lagrangian e1l = r 1 2 ()2 1 2 e2 ()2 + m2 e , (5.3) (5.4) scalar lagrangian four-dimensional su (2) su (2) gauged supergravity, constructed {$9803231$}. making coordinate transformation = log(r ) z = log(r/), metric (5.3) becomes ds2 4 = 1 4 e2x (w 1 dt2 + w (dx + (w 1 1) dt)2) + dy2 + dz2 , w = (1 + qw eyz)(1 + q w ey+z) .
