abstract

the linearized interactions of eleven-dimensional supergravity are obtained in a man-
ifestly supersymmetric light-cone gauge formalism. these vertices are used to calculate
certain one-loop processes involving external gravitini, antisymmetric three-form poten-
tials and gravitons, thereby determining some protected terms in the eective action of
m-theory compactied on a two-torus.

introduction

classical eleven-dimensional supergravity [1] is the long wavelength or low energy
in a number of papers [3,4,5,6] it has been shown that certain
limit of m-theory [2].
one-loop quantum calculations in compactied eleven-dimensional supergravity generate
terms in the eective m-theory action that arise in string theory as perturbative and
non-perturbative eects. these loop calculations would have been very complicated using
standard feynman rules for the component elds, in which the many cancellations between
dierent contributions are not at all apparent. such cancellations would be natural in a
covariant eleven-dimensional superspace formalism, but such a formalism only exists for
the on-shell theory [7]. in the absence of useful eleven-dimensional covariant superspace
feynman rules, these one-loop calculations made use of a supersymmetric light-cone gauge.
in which sucient supersymmetry is manifest to streamline the calculations. the purpose
of this paper is to obtain the light-cone gauge feynman rules that were used in the earlier
papers and illustrate their use by evaluating some further one-loop amplitudes.

we will start from the quantum mechanical description of the massless eleven-
dimensional superparticle to obtain vertex operators that describe interacting particles
in linearized approximation. this will be sucient to evaluate the one-loop feynman
diagrams by integrating over the world-lines of the circulating particles, with the vertex
operator insertions representing the interactions with the external particles. this ap-
proach is modeled on the standard methods for evaluating string theory diagrams. it has
also proved to be an ecient method [8] for calculating radiative corrections to yangmills
theories of relevance to the standard model [9] and s-matrix elements in n = 8, d = 4
supergravity [10]. in the case of the four-graviton amplitude the loop calculation reduces
to the strikingly simple form of a simple kinematic factor multiplying a scalar eld theory
box diagram.

in section 2 the global and local symmetries of the eleven-dimensional superparticle
action will be elucidated and the light-cone superspace quantum mechanics described. the
light-cone superspace form of the vertex operators that describe the cubic interactions of
the component elds will be introduced in section 3. as with the analogous superstring
vertices these describe the emission of on-shell particles. in this case these comprise the
graviton, gravitino and three-form potential with vertices that will be denoted vh, v
and vc(3) , respectively. the form of these vertex operators is uniquely determined by
the requirement that they transform appropriately under the 32-component supersym-
metry transformations, which form an so(10, 1) spinor.
in the light-cone gauge these
supersymmetries divide into sixteen linearly realized transformations and sixteen that are
realized nonlinearly. the linear supersymmetry transformations are suciently simple to
be checked completely. in order to determine the complete expressions for the vertices the
only nonlinear supersymmetry transformation that needs to be checked is that of the gravi-
ton vertex. the nonlinear transformations of the other vertices are complicated and will

1

not be considered. certain total derivatives with respect to the world-line time parameter
arise in the closure for the supersymmetry algebra which determine the time variations of
the cubic interaction contributions to the light-cone supercharges. closure of the super-
symmetry algebra also generates higher-order interaction terms involving arbitrary powers
of the superelds, but these will not be considered here. in section 4 dimensional reduc-
tion of the linearized eleven-dimensional theory on a circle is shown to reproduce the point
particle limit of the corresponding linearized iia superstring theory.

section 5 will describe the use of these vertex operators to calculate certain classes
of one-loop amplitudes in eleven-dimensional supergravity compactied on a circle or a
two-torus. the particular processes that we will consider are ones that correspond to in-
teractions in the eective action that are integrals over half the on-shell superspace and are
very strongly constrained by supersymmetry. we will argue that the one-loop amplitudes
for such protected processes may be calculated completely by using the linearized (cubic)
interaction vertices and do not recieve contributions from higher order contact terms. in
part this will ll in details used in obtaining the one-loop results described in [3,4] where
connections to perturbative and nonperturbative d-instanton induced terms in type iib
string theory [11] were made. in addition some further amplitudes will be evaluated that
lead to terms in the iib eective action involving the third-rank and self-dual fth-rank
eld strengths.

2. the massless eleven-dimensional superparticle in light-cone gauge

the conguration space of an eleven-dimensional superparticle has eleven bosonic
coordinates, x  ( = 0, 1,    , 9, 11), which form a so(10, 1) vector and 32 fermionic
grassmann coordinates,  a ( a = 1, . . . , 32), that form a majorana so(10, 1) spinor. the
action for such a particle is given by

sparticle =

(2.1)

where

(2.2)
where the matrices  are 32  32-component dirac matrices. the equations of motion
that follow from this action are

  = x   i ,

2 = 0

  = 0

   = 0 .

the action is invariant under global poincare and supersymmetry transformations,

 = ,

x  = i,

2

(2.3)

(2.4)

where  a is a constant majorana spinor parameter, as well as local reparameterizations
and kappa symmetry transformations,

 = i ,

x  = i,

e = 4e  ,

(2.5)

where the parameter  a( ) is a majorana spinor and a world-line scalar density.

there is no obvious way of formulating the quantum mechanics of this system co-
variantly but it is straightforward to quantize the system in the light-cone gauge. this is
dened by using the reparameterization invariance and kappa symmetry to choose

x + = x+ + p+,

+ = 0,

where the light-cone coordinates are dened by1

and

x + =

(x 0 + x 9),

x  =

(2.6)

(2.7)

(2.8)

the matrix + projects onto a 16  16 subspace spanned by so(9) majorana spinors.
in this gauge the action is expressed in terms of the transverse coordinates, x i( ) (i =
1,    , 8, 11), and the 16-component so(9) spinor, sa (a = 1, . . . , 16), so that

sl.c. =z d(cid:0)

( x i)2  is s (cid:1).

(2.9)

the equations of motion,  x i/ = 0 = sa/ imply that both the momentum op-
erator, pi = x i and the fermionic operator sa are constant. the (anti)commutation
relations that follow from the poisson brackets are

[x i, pj ] = iij ,

{sa, sb} = ab.

(2.10)

the 32 components of the so(10, 1) space-time supersymmetry decompose into a
16+ of so(9)  u (1) that is linearly realized and a 16 that is nonlinearly realized. the
linearly realized supersymmetries are those components that satisfy + = 0 and will be
associated with a spinor parameter . they are generated by the sa and their action on
the coordinates is given by

1 with this choice of light-cone directions the conventional coordinates of the iia theory will

s =pp+.

(2.11)

be obtained by compactifying the x 11 direction.

the nonlinearly realized supersymmetries will be associated with a second 16-component

the physical states consist of 44 transverse symmetric traceless tensor states |iji (with
|iji = |jii and |iii = 0) representing the graviton, 128 gamma-tracelss spinor-vector

2.1. supersymmetry in the light-cone gauge

the lagrangian of eleven-dimensional supergravity [1] contains three elds: the gravi-
 and the three-form potential c . the covariant equations of

ton h , the gravitino  a
motion imply k k  = 0 together with the physical state conditions,

k h

 =

1
2

kh
,

 = k  =   k = 0,

k c(3)

  = 0 .

(2.14)

the light-cone gauge is reached by using the reparameterization invariance, local
supersymmetry and the local symmetry associated with the three-form potential to impose
the conditions

h +
 = 0,

a+ = 0,



c +

 = 0.

(2.15)

as usual, the light-cone vertex operators will have a particularly simple form in a frame in
which k+ = 0, which is attainable in general when there are few enough external particles.
it is also convenient to take k to be nite so that, with the condition k k  = 0, the
transverse momenta satisfy ki ki = 0, which is only possible for complexied momenta.
the physical momenta can then be reached by analytic continuation. this kinematic set-up
has proved useful in superstring calculations and will be general enough for our purposes.
in this case the conditions (2.14) become

ki hi

 =

1
2

k hi

i ,

kii = 0 = (j kj  +k), i i = +,

ki c(3)

i  = 0.

(2.16)

4

the  components are determined by the constraints (2.14) for non-zero k+ but are

unrestricted when k+ = 0. in writing (2.16) we have assumed that the components,

h 
 ,

a,

c 
ij ,

(2.17)

are non-innite. another condition that follows from (2.14) when k+ 6= 0 is the trace-
lessness condition, h i
i = 0, from which it follows that the physical state condition for the
graviton in (2.16) is,

ki hi

 = 0.

(2.18)

when k+ = 0, the light-cone tracelessness condition does not follow from (2.14) but it can
be imposed by hand.

the physical elds are classied in representations of so(9). thus hij is a traceless
is a vector and h is a scalar. the components
ij . the gravitino decomposes into two so(9)

symmetric second-rank tensor, while h 
i
of the three-form potential are cijk and c 
parts,

i = 0,

(2.20)

the covariant supersymmetry transformations of the component elds are given by2

h = (),

[  ],

(2.21)

where the linearized covariant derivative is dened by

d() =(cid:0)k  + k[ h] (cid:1)

(2.22)

(2.23)

and the super-covariant f  is simply the eld strength f  = 4k[ c(3)
t is dened by

t    =

in the light-cone gauge the supersymmetry transformations (2.21) must be accom-
panied by compensating gauge transformations in order to preserve the gauge conditions
(2.15). the compensating reparameterizations are determined by

h +

i =

2

(+i + i +) + k+i + ki +.

(2.24)

2 numerical factors dier slightly from [1]. a similar normalization has been taken in [12].

5

so that the light-cone gauge condition, h+

i = 0 is preserved by choosing

i = 

1
2k+ +i ,

+ = 0 .

hence the transverse components of the graviton transform in the following way,

hij = (i j)

(2.25)

(2.26)

(2.27)

the reparametrization transformations on i and c(3)

lm n vanish in the free-eld limit
and supersymmetry transformations for these elds in (2.21) are to be compensated by
gauge transformations,

c(3)

(2.28)

where the gauge parameters  and   are an so(10, 1) majorana spinor and a two-form,

3. supersymmetry and the vertex operators

before showing in some detail how the vertex operators are determined by the require-
ment that they form a representation of the supersymmetry algebra we will summarize the
results. the vertex operator describing the emission of an on-shell physical eld, , will
be written in the form

v = ueikx = ueiki x i ( )eikp+ ,

where the prefactor u depends on the species of eld.

the following notation will also be introduced,

rlm n =

1
12slm ns, ril =

1
4sils .

(3.1)

(3.2)

the operators ril form a representation of the transverse so(9) algebra and are trans-
verse angular momentum operators. extensive use will be made later of the so(9) fierz
identity

which is valid for sixteen-component majorana spinors.

3.1. summary of vertex operators

graviton vertex operator:
the transverse graviton vertex operator is given by

uh = hij(cid:0) x i x j  2 x irjm km + 2rilrjm klkm(cid:1),

while the longitudinal vertex operators are given by

uh = h 

i p+(cid:0) x i  rjm km(cid:1),

uh = hp+p+.

the graviton wavefunctions in these expressions satisfy the conditions (2.18).

gravitino vertex operator:

(3.4)

(3.5)

(3.6)

the transverse gravitino vertex operator is given by

u = ipp+s(cid:0) x i  2rij kj(cid:1) +

lsrijrlm kj km(cid:9) ,

(3.7)

1

pp+

while the longitudinal gravitino vertex is given by

u = p+s  p+ 

xs.

(3.8)

they satisfy the physical state conditions (2.20).

three-form potential vertex operator:
the vertex operator for the transverse components of the eld strength of the poten-

tial, c(3), is given by

the longitudinal components of the eld strength have vertex operators dened by

uc(3) = film n(cid:0) x i 

3rij kj(cid:1)rlm n .

2

uc(3) = f



lm n p+rlm n ,

(3.9)

(3.10)

and the components of f are constrained by (2.16).

one direct way of checking the expressions for the vertex operators is to evaluate
their matrix elements between on-shell states and compare with the expressions for the
three-particle couplings in the eld theory. as an example, consider the three-graviton
vertex in light-cone gravity which is given by [13]

l3  2hjlk hij lhik  hklk hij lhij .

(3.11)

this is easily seen to be equal to the expression obtained by taking the a matrix element
of the graviton vertex operators,

a3 = hh1, k1|hij
where |h3, k3i = hij
angular momentum on the graviton states so that,

2 (cid:0)pi pj  2pirjm km

2(cid:0)m r|jsi  jr|m si + m s|rji  js|rmi(cid:1).

(3.13)

3.2. supersymmetry transformation on vertex operators

the vertex operators dened in (3.4) to (3.9) may be derived from the requirement
that they form a representation of the linearized supersymmetry transformations of eleven-
dimensional supergravity. we will go some way to demonstrating this explicitly although
we will not give a complete discussion of all the supersymmetry transformations.

8

proceeding by analogy with the method used in light-cone gauge string theory [14]
(which was explained more fully in [15]), the 32-component supercharge, q a, decomposes
into the so(9) spinors qa (with parameter a) and qa (with parameter a). whereas
the momentum and the qa supercharge are given by their free-eld expressions the op-
erator qa, as well as the hamiltonian h, receive interaction corrections at every order in
perturbation theory. the algebra,

{qa, qb} = 2p+ab,

{ qa, qb} = 2i x i,

[h, qa] = 0 = [h, qa],

{ qa, qb} = 2hab,

(3.14)

determines the form of the interaction corrections.

we may expand the interaction operators in powers of the elds, h = h2 + h3 + . . .,
3 + . . ., where a subscript n indicates an operator that has n powers of the

qa = qa
elds. the lowest-order corrections to the free-eld algebra are given by

2 + qa

[h3, qa] = 0,

{ qa

3 , qb} = 0,

and

[h2, qa

3 ] + [h3, qa

3 } = 2h3ab.
these expressions determine how the free-eld generators (h2, qa and qa
interaction terms.

to make contact with the vertex operator description we can associate each n-eld

interaction term with a state in the n-particle hilbert space so that

(3.17)

cubic interaction vertices are then identied with matrix elements in which one of the
three external legs is a physical on-shell state, ,

v = h|hi3,

 = h| qai3.
w a

(3.18)

these are representations of the interactions in a two-particle space that can be represented
by single creation and annihilation operators in a standard manner. the supersymmetry
transformations of the vertices therefore follow by taking the corresponding matrix element
of (3.16),

v = vh(h) + vc(3)(c(3)),

vc(3) = v()

where the s are the variations associated with the free-eld supersymmetry operators in
(3.15) and (3.16) and the time derivatives are generated by h2. the operators wh, w
and wc(3), dened in (3.18), transform under supersymmetry as

(3.20)

in (3.19) and (3.20) the supersymmetry-transformed wavefunctions such as h are given
by the linearized supersymmetry transformations of the elds, (2.26), (2.32) and (2.33).

3.3. linear supersymmetry on the graviton vertex

under the linearly realized supersymmetry transformation, x i = 0, s =pp+, the

graviton vertex operator, vh = uheikx (with uh dened in (3.4)), transforms according
to,

vh = hijpp+(cid:0) x ijks kk +

= k[lhi]j lipp+s(cid:0) x j  2rjm km(cid:1)eikx .

1
2

iks sjls kk kl(cid:1)eikx

hence the linear supersymmetry transformation of the graviton vertex operator is the
gravitino vertex, ueikx (with u dened by (3.7)), with the wavefunction  given by
(2.32). none of the other terms in the gravitino vertex (3.7) contribute since they depend
on   (2.32), which vanishes for the linear components of supersymmetry when k+ = 0.

(3.21)

3.4. nonlinear supersymmetry on the graviton vertex

to determine the full structure of gravitino vertex operator including the terms
in (3.7) depending on , a non-linearly realized supersymmetry transformation on uh
has to be performed. under the non-linear supersymmetry transformations x i =

by

2is/pp+ , s = i x i i/pp+ . the transformation of the graviton vertex is given

the last term, which is of order s5, can be re-expressed using (3.3) as

(3.22)

ihij n kns rilrjm klkm = 

2
9

ihij ilks rkmrjn klkm kn .

(3.23)

10

hence, (3.22) can be written as

vh = 2ikhij ipp+s(cid:0) x j  2rjm km(cid:1)eikx

(3.25)

hij (is)a(cid:0) x j  2rjm km(cid:1)eikx .

this is precisely of the expected form. the right-hand side of (3.24) is the sum of the
gravitino vertex operator (3.7) with wave-function ( ) and the time derivative of wh,
which is thus determined.

3.5. linear supersymmetry on the gravitino vertex

we shall now consider the linear supersymmetry transformation of the gravitino vertex
operator (3.7) which contains much information concerning the graviton and three-form
potential vertex operators. in fact, since the transformation contains terms of order s0, s2
and s4, which are the same orders as in uh (3.4) and uc(3) (3.9), it will be sucient to
calculate the linear supersymmetry transformation to conrm the structure of the other
two vertex operators. the linear supersymmetry transformation, (2.11), of the gravitino
vertex is determined by,

v =(ip+ + il x l)(cid:0) x i  2rij kj(cid:1)eikx + (i p+s + ils x l)(ijskj )eikx

ilrijrlm kj km eikx +

(3.26)
in order to check that this agrees with the expected transformation it is necessary
to use fierz transformations to rearrange these terms so that  contracts into the grav-
itino wavefunction  or . we will make use of four identities, ignoring the longitudinal
polarizations, that follow from (3.3). firstly,

issij kj = i rij kj  3ilrilm km .

(3.27)

3.6. linear supersymmetry on the three-form potential vertex

the structure of the three-form pontential vertex operator has already been deter-
mined from the linear supersymmetry transformation of the gravitino vertex but an addi-
tional check is given by the linear supersymmetry transformation of the c(3) vertex. given
the expression for uc(3) in (3.9) this vertex can be written as

vc(3) = film n(cid:0) x i 

= 3klc(3)

3rij kj(cid:1)rlm n eikx

im n(cid:0) x i 

3rij kj(cid:1)rlm n eikx + (total derivative) .

(3.35)

in the following we will drop the total derivative term, although this is an important
contribution to contact interactions. the linear supersymmetry transformation of (3.35)
gives

uc(3) = pp+

c(3). therefore, uc(3) is consistent with the expected supersymmetry transformation
(3.19) (ignoring the total derivatives).

4. dimensional reduction on s1

type iia supergravity arises by dimensional reduction of eleven dimensional super-
gravity on a circle [16] so that compactication of the vertex operators on a circle of radius
r11 should coincide with the vertex operators of type iia supergravity. for simplicity, we
will set the momentum in the eleventh dimension to zero so that k11 = 0. the case of non-
zero k11 describes interactions of d-particles. in making this reduction we will decompose
so(9) spinors into their so(8) components so that

sa = (sa, s a),

13

(4.1)

where a, a label the two inequivalent so(8) spinors (a, a = 1, . . . , 8) and {sa, sb} =
ab,{s a, s b} =  ab. the 16 16 so(9) gamma matrices decompose into the standard 8 8
matrices, i

(4.6)

to begin with we will review how the iia supergravity vertices arise from the point-particle
limit of those of the iia superstring.

4.1. point particle limit of the iia superstring vertices

the vertex operator for any massless eld, , in iia superstring theory has the form,

where

v (iia)


= u (iia)



eikx ,

u (iia)



=  

aboa ob,

(4.7)

(4.8)

and  
ab is the on-shell wavefunction for  which is either a second-rank tensor, a spinor-
vector or a bi-spinor  a and b may either be vector or spinor labels. the prefactor is
correspondingly a product of left-moving and right-moving bosonic or fermionic operators.
in the light-cone gauge these are classied into so(8) representations.

14

the left-moving and right-moving bosonic operators are either transverse vectors,

bi = x i 
where i = 1, . . . , 8, or singlets,

(4.9)

(4.10)

the left-moving fermionic prefactor has two pieces corresponding to the two inequivalent
so(8) spinors,

f a =

while the pieces of the right-moving fermion prefactor are

f a =pp+ s a ,

f a =

(  x s)a 

in these expressions x  ( + i)x, x  (  i)x and { s a, sb} = 0. the point-
particle limit of iia string theory is simply obtained by dropping all the  dependence of
the variables so that

and only the zero modes of s and s are retained.

x i = x i = x i,

(4.13)

the tensor wavefunctions ij,  

and   describe the massless bosonic elds in the
n s  n s sector while the bispinors ab ,  ab ,  ab and ab describe the massless bosons of
the r  r sector (where the rst index labels the left-movers and the second index labels
the right-movers). using the physical state conditions the latter can be written as,

i = 0 while f

4.2. reduction of the graviton vertex operator

the reduction of the eleven-dimensional graviton vertex operator (3.4) on a circle gives
rise to the vertex operators of the graviton (h), dilaton () and one-form gauge potential
(c(1)) in iia supergravity theory. for simplicity, we will here consider only the transverse
parts of the vertex operators.

15

the covariant relation between the eleven-dimensional m-theory metric and the ten-
dimensional iia metric in the string frame is given by the ansatz [2] (setting the r  r
vector eld to zero),

g dx dx = e4/3(dx11)2 + e2/3giia

 dxdx

from which the corresponding metric uctuations are related by

h = hiia

  ,

h1111 =

(4.15)

(4.16)

where ,  = 0, 1,    , 9. however, we want to compare the ten-dimensional and eleven-
dimensional theories in their respective light-cone gauges. in particular, setting h+ = 0
in (4.16) leads to

hiia
+ = 

 = 

2
3

1
2

h1111,

(4.17)

while the usual ten-dimensional light-cone gauge condition in the type iia theory sets
hiia
+ = 0. this means that in order to compare with the usual light-cone vertices of the
iia theory it is necessary to perform a gauge transformation in order to transform away
the component hiia
+ = 0 can
obviously only be compatible with the eleven-dimensional condition h+ = 0 by relaxing
the tracelessness condition, hi
i + h11 11 = 0. as remarked earlier, in the kinematic
regime k+ = 0 this tracelessness condition is not a necessary consequence of the choice of
light-cone gauge, and we will choose the very convenient alternative constraint

+ after the identication (4.16) is made. but the condition hiia

i = hi

upon dimensional reduction the ten-dimensional graviton and dilaton vertex operators

are both contained in

h11 11 = 0.

limit of the iia graviton vertex operator. the dilaton vertex can be identied as the

simply a reection of the fact that the unphysical hiia
+ polarization (4.17) is generated by
the dimensional reduction (4.15) in the light-cone gauge. therefore, the condition (4.18)
h1111 = 0 is exactly what is needed to remove the redundant terms in (4.20) and obtain
the iia graviton and dilaton vertex operators.

(4.21)

(4.22)

has been used. this coincides with the expression for the one-form vertex operator of the
iia theory up to a total derivative which is irrelevant here.

4.3. reduction of the gravitino vertex operator

the eleven-dimensional gravitino  decomposes into two ten-dimensional majorana-

weyl spinor-vectors l , r ,

l  =

1
2

(1 + 11),

r  =

1
2

(1  11)

(4.23)

where the subscripts l, r correspond to the two chiralities which are correlated in iia
string theory with the left and right directions on the worldsheet.

upon compactication, the above decomposition is accompanied with a shift of the

eleven-dimensional gravitino which is given by the covariant relation,

 = iia

 

1
2

1111,

(4.24)



where iia
is the gravitino wavefunction in the iia string frame. given the eleven-
dimensional light-cone gauge condition, + = 0, the type iia theory has nonvanishing
+
iia proportional to 11. this is analogous to the earlier discussion in which we saw
that in general hiia
+ 6= 0 when h+ = 0. just as this was remedied by making the choice

17

h11 11 = 0 as a metric constraint, it is convenient to make the choice 11 = 0 as an alter-
native to the eleven-dimensional gamma-tracelessness condition in (2.14). in this way the
supersymmetry transformations of section 3 still work with the trace part of the graviton
vertex mapped to the gamma-trace part of the gravitino vertex.

the physical state conditions for the gravitino are then

k k  = 0,

k  = 0,

k   = k   ,

11 = 0

(4.25)

which can be rewritten as, in the light-cone gauge with k+ = 0,

ki i   = k i i ,

ki ki = 0,

ki i ( i) = 0,

11 = 0 = 11
ki i   k ii = 2(k    k  ).

(4.26)

the light-cone components of the spinors, (4.23) , are obtained as before by projecting

with p ,

l i = (p +l i)a,
a

 a
l i = (p l i) a,  a

r i = (p +r i) a,

r i = (p r i)a.

without loss of generality, we will consider only the left-handed gravitino, l . the

(4.28)

(4.29)

has been used which can be derived using (4.6). the terms in the rst line of (4.28) are

apparently the vertex operator for the spin-3/2 states in the point-particle limit of iia
string theory from which the gamma-trace part can be separated as the dilatino vertex
operator. it would, then, be expected that the remaining terms in (4.28) should vanish.
indeed, using the physical state conditions, (4.26), and the ten-dimensional fierz, (4.6), it
can be shown that these terms vanish up to total derivative terms.

18

4.4. reduction of the three-form potential vertex operator

the eleven-dimensional three-form potential gives rise to both the n sn s two-form,
b , and the r r three-form potential in ten dimensions. the components of (3.9) with
one index in the eleventh direction results in the n s  n s two-form vertex operator upon
compactication,

the superscript iia indicates that the vertex is that of iia supergravity (while the su-
perscript 10 in (4.33) means the vertex is obtained from dimensional reduction of the
appropriate eleven-dimensional vertex).

(4.34)

5. one-loop amplitudes in the light-cone gauge

in this section the rst-quantized description of the eleven-dimensional theory de-
veloped in the previous sections will be applied to the calculation of one-loop feynman
diagrams by integrating over the world-lines of the circulating particles. this will ll in
some of the details of the calculations of the r4 and 16 eective interactions of the type

19

iib theory outlined in [3] and [4]. in addition other interactions of the same dimension are
obtained from one-loop processes in the eleven-dimensional theory.

the world-line path integral for the one-loop n particle scattering amplitude in eleven

dimensional supergravity is given by

where the vertex operators representing the emission of on-shell particles were dened
in section 3. the one-loop amplitude of eleven-dimensional supergravity compactied to
(11  d) dimensions on a d-torus, t d, can be written as
2+g(d)ij li lj )tr* n

vd z dt
where g(d)
ij is the metric on t d, li are the kaluza-klein momenta, vd is the volume of the
torus t d and p is the loop momentum transverse to the compact directions. the overall
factor 1/vd is the measure for the summation over the kaluza-klein momenta and the
trace in (5.2) is taken over the fermionic modes sa. the brackets denote the path ordered
expectation value of the vertex operators evaluated with the following green functions
involving the uctuating quantum elds.

the universal momentum factors of eikx in the vertex operators give contributions to
the expectation value of the form

hy eikix(ti)i = e

pi6=j

kikj gb (ti,tj )

.

(5.4)

in the following example we will only be interested in the leading terms in the low en-
ergy expansion, which means that only the loop amplitude with the lowest number of
momenta needs to be considered. hence the contribution (5.4) can be replaced by 1 in
this approximation.

the so(9) fermionic spinor operator s can be expressed in terms of eight creation and
eight annihilation operators which span the space of 256 polarizations of the supergraviton.
the only nonzero contributions come from traces with at least sixteen insertions of the
operator sa. we shall focus on a protected class of amplitudes where the path integral
over the fermionic world-line variables in which the vertex operators introduce precisely

20

sixteen fermionic zero modes. for this special class of amplitudes there are no contractions
involving the green functions (5.3). the bosonic vertex operators (3.4)(3.10) contain the
two bilinears,

rlm n =

1
12slm ns, ril =

1
4sils .

the sixteen factors of sa in the trace are provided by the eight rs in any of the protected
one-loop amplitudes with external bosons. the trace of sixteen sa is given by

(5.5)

(5.6)

tr(cid:0)sa1   sa16(cid:1) = a1a16 ,

from which it is easy to deduce the tensors that arise from matrix elements of the various
dierent combinations of rlm n and ril. for example, the tensor t16 dened by the trace
involving eight ril is dened by
ti1i2i16
16

= a1a16 i1i2
a1a2

(5.7)

i3i4
a3a4    i15i16

a15a16

.

nontrivial relations between the various tensors can be found using fierz transformations.
amplitudes with external fermions also contain the trace of sixteen factors of sa which
can be arranged by fierz tranformations into the trace of products of eight bilinears of the
form (5.5).

we therefore see that for the protected processes the trace over the sas simply
produces a kinematic factor. the leading term in the low energy expansion of the amplitude
can then be obtained by setting the external momenta to zero in the integrand which makes
the integration over the proper times t(r) trivial, simply giving a power t n in the integrand.
the resulting expression for the leading term in the low energy expansion of (5.2) for a
protected process with n external states has the form

a(d)

n =

1
vd

knz 

0

dt
t

t n+d/211/2 x{li }

eg(d)ij li lj f (g(d)ij , li)

(5.8)

where kn is the kinematic factor for a specic scattering amplitude depending on particle
species and f (g(d)ij , li) is a generic function of the torus metric and the kaluza-klein mo-
mentum. the extra factor of t d/211/2 comes from the integration over the non-compact
loop momentum p.

an important feature of the protected class of loop amplitudes that we are considering
is that the contractions between the vertex operators does not generate any factors of the
green functions (5.3), which have short distance singularities. the only contractions are
between factors of eikx . this feature is directly related to the fact that the contact
interactions that are present in the complete theory do not, in fact, contribute to these
particular processes. this justies the fact that we have ignored such interactions.

21

5.1. compactication on a circle

we will now review the way in which one-loop calculations in compactied eleven-

dimensional supergravity compare with known results from string theory. the simplest

case is that of compactication on a circle which is equivalent to iia string theory in ten

dimensions [2]. for simplicity only four-point functions involving four bosonic elds in the
n s  n s sector (the graviton, dilaton and two-form potential) will be considered.

the dimensionally-reduced vertex operators of relevance are given by (4.19) for the

graviton and (4.32) for the two-form potential. a non-vanishing trace over the fermionic
zero modes only arises from the part of the vertices of order s2 s2 which are given by

the value of the constant c = 22/3 can be determined by connecting it, via t-duality
on a further circle, with the iib theory. using the relation r11 = g2/3

the kinematic factor k takes the form,

where the tensor ti1i8 (in = 1,    , 8) is dened in [17] and the linearized riemann tensor
is replaced by a generalized tensor which also contains the two-form potential and the

dilaton,

this is the tensor that can be obtained from the four-point tree-level amplitude of type ii
string theories including the n s  n s two-form potential and the dilaton [18].

5.2. compactication on a two torus and type iib string theory

the compactication of eleven-dimensional supergravity on a two dimensional torus
t 2 of volume v2 = r8r11(in the m-theory frame) and complex structure  is related to
the iib string theory compactied on a circle of circumference rb(in the string frame)
[19], where the complex structure is identied as the modulus, b, of iib string theory.
the sl(2, z) self-duality of iib string theory is identied with the invariance of m-theory
under the group of large dieomorphisms of t 2.

the correspondence between the parameters of the two theories is [19]

 = b( c(0) + ieb ),

rb = v 3/4

(5.13)

where c(0), b are the iib r  r scalar and dilaton, respectively, and   1 + i2. the
metric on the torus is given by

the zweibein in a special lorentz gauge can be written as

(5.15)

where i, a(= 1, 2) denote the two-dimensional world and tangent space indices respectively.
the zweibein parameterizes the coset sl(2, r)/u (1) where the sl(2, r) acts by matrix
multiplication from the left and the local u (1) acts from the right which can be used
to x the gauge (5.15). fixing the local u (1) symmetry leads to the standard nonlinear
realization of the sl(2, r) transformation acting on the complex structure ,

(5.16)

where the coecients are integers and satisfy ad  bc = 1.
it is convenient to go to a
complex basis in the tangent space, z = x1 + ix2, z = x1  ix2 in which the zweibein now
reads

i = ir v2

and the inverse zweibein is

(5.18)

we will begin by reviewing the one-loop calculations of four-graviton [3] and sixteen-
fermion [4] scattering amplitudes. amplitudes that involve c(3) will also be calculated and

23

may be of interest in relation to the matrix theory calculation of the three-form potential
scattering amplitudes [20]. applying (5.2) to the case of the two torus compactication,
the four-graviton one-loop amplitude [3] can be written as

a(2)

r4 =

1
v2

kr4xm,nz 

0

dt

t 3/2 et |m+n|2/v22

(5.19)

where the kinematic factor kr4 is (5.11) with the two-form pontetial and the dilaton set to
zero. a double poisson resummation turns the sum over the kaluza-klein charges (m, n)
into a sum over the windings ( m, n) of the loop around the two cycles of t 2 and (5.19)
can be expressed as

r4 =

where f (0,0)(, ) is the sl(2, z)-invariant nonholomorphic modular function,

f (0,0)(, ) = x( m,n)6=(0,0)

| m + n|3 .

the r4 term conserves the u (1) charge of classical iib supergravity and in the decom-
pactication limit v2   the rst term in (5.20) gives a nite r4 interaction in the
eleven-dimensional theory. other iib four-point bosonic amplitudes which conserve the
u (1) charge and share the structure (5.20) have kinematic factors that can be schematically
written as3

( f5)4 + (gg)2 + (p p )2 + r2(gg + p p ) + p p gg +    , (5.22)
where the ellipses denote additional mixed terms. here f5 is the self-dual ve-form eld
strength and g is a complex linear combination of the n s  n s and r  r three-form
eld strengths given by

while the maurer-cartan form is given by,

g =

p =

.

the elds f5, g and p have u (1) charges zero, one and two, respectively, while the complex
conjugate quantities, denoted g and p , have u (1) charges of the opposite sign.

such terms can be systematically described in linearized iib superspace in terms of a
constrained scalar supereld, (x, ), where  is a sixteen-component complex grassmann

3 such terms were also discussed in [21]

24

coordinate that transforms as a weyl spinor of so(9, 1). after imposing the appropriate
constraints  has the expansion [22],

 = 0 + ,

(5.25)

where 0 is the constant value of the complex scalar eld and  is the uctuation dened
by

 =(  0) + i + g + i   +   

 +   (g

 r
)

+  ( f5) + 52
+ 73 + 84 

(5.26)
where ,  are the dilatino and the gravitino, respectively. the terms of order 5 and
higher have been written schematically (except the term of order 6 which will be used
later). the linearized interactions of the component elds in the limit of weak coupling
(0  ) are contained in [4]

s = ()3rez d10xd16f [].

(5.27)

the component interactions are obtained by taylor expanding f in powers of  followed
by integration over the 16 grassmann parameters. of course, this expression does not
capture the modular properties of the complete nonlinear interactions.

the r4 term occurs at order 4 together with the terms in (5.22). for example,
(gg)2 is obtained by combining two powers of each of the 2 and 6 terms. the
grassmann integration generates the pattern of contractions between the tensor elds.
the terms in (5.22) also arise naturally from the eleven-dimensional perspective with
appropriate identications of the polarization tensors as will be seen shortly.

the sixteen-dilatino term 16 has u (1) charge 24. this interaction was obtained in
[4] by a covariant argument using the fact that the zero-momentum eleven-dimensional
gravitino vertex can be expressed in terms of the eleven-dimensional supercharge. the
same result can be obtained using the light-cone gauge gravitino vertex operator (3.7).
the only contributions come from factors in which there are eight vertices from each of
the i and i terms in (3.7). this follows from the fact that only terms with no net power
of p+ contribute to the momentum integral. furthermore, there must be a total of sixteen
powers of s so that the only terms in the vertex (3.7) that contribute to the amplitude are

u =pp+is x i ,

u  =

1

pp+

i  

xs x i .

(5.28)

the complex dilatino eld  is a ten-dimensional weyl spinor that is identied with a
particular polarization state of the eleven-dimensional gravitino compactied on t 2 so its

25

vertex operator follows simply from (5.28) [4]. the amplitude can then be obtained in much
the same way as for the four-graviton case using (5.2). the signicant new feature is the
presence of a complex function of the kaluza-klein momentum in front of the exponential,

in contrast to the u (1) charge conserving amplitudes considered before, the 16 term
violates 24 units of u (1) charge and is not present in the eleven-dimensional theory. this
is seen explicitly from (5.29) which vanishes in the eleven-dimensional limit v  , while it
survives in the ten-dimensional iib limit. this is true for all the other u (1) charge violating
terms. in [23] the explicit form of (5.30) was derived from space-time supersymmetry and
sl(2, z) invariance of iib string theory alone.

in [4] the scalar eld strength p (5.24) of iib supergravity was identied with the
component zz of the spin connection of eleven dimensional supergravity on t 2 which
can be written as

zz =

ei
zej

zhij,

(5.31)

2

where i, j = 8, 11 and p 
 corresponds to zz. the one-loop amplitude that generates the
interaction (p p )2 in (5.22) gets contributions from the factors rzlrzm and rzlrzm
in the graviton vertex operator, (3.4).

we will now consider the vertex operators for the three-form potential c(3) which
reduce, upon compactication on a torus, to the iib two-form potentials and four-form
potential c(4). the correspondence is given by

 = c(4)
c(3)

8,

c(3)

11 = b ,

c(3)

8 = c(2)


(5.32)

where , ,  are so(8, 1) indices. therefore, in terms of the m-theory parameters, the
complex three-form eld strength g (5.23) can be written as

k[c(3)

]z =

(k[c(3)

and g is identied with k[c(3)

(5.35)

where i, j, l, m, n are so(7) vector indices.

we will now discuss protected interaction terms that include the antisymmetric ten-
sor c3 eld associated with the vertices (5.33) and (5.34). there are two amplitudes that
only involve g and g with nozero u (1) weight namely g8 and g52g. it is easy to see
that in the calculation of the g8 amplitude saturating the fermionic modes picks out the
pzrlmn term of each the vertex vg in (5.35). for the g52g amplitude a combination of
four factors of the pzrlmn term in vg, one factor of the rzjrlmnkj term in vg, and one
from the rzjrlmnkj term in vg is required. these amplitudes can be calculated in the
same way as the 16 term and result in eective interactions of the form f (4,4)g8 and
f (2,2)g52g, where

f (4,4)(, ) =

f (2,2)(, ) =

(5.36)

the transformation properties of the elds and the generalized modular functions in (5.36)
lead to the expected sl(2, z)-invariant interactions in the iib theory.

more generally, the exact expression for all the protected iib higher-derivative inter-
actions that follow from the expansion of (5.27) can be deduced by considering the appro-
priate decompactication limit of one-loop amplitudes in compactied eleven-dimensional
supergravity. the resulting interactions are proportional to

z d10xg eb /2 f (w,w)(, )p (2w),

(5.37)

where p (2w) denotes an interaction between a set of elds with net u (1) charge 2w and

f (w,w)(, ) =

f (w,w)(, ) =

(w + 3/2)

another interesting iib amplitude which can be obtained in this way is the amplitude
involving four self-dual ve-form elds f5. the eleven dimensional vertex (5.34) gives the
amplitude which involves ( f5)ilmn8. from the self-duality of f5 it follows that ( f5)ilmn8 is
equivalent to ( f5)ijlmn, hence the amplitude calculated in eleven dimensional supergravity
on t 2 can be expressed covariantly.
lmn in (5.34) has 35
physical degrees of freedom which is the number of physical components of the self-dual
ve-form f5. the calculation of the four  f5 amplitude is analogous to the r4 amplitude
and it is straightforward to show that the amplitude has the same modular structure
(5.20). the main dierence lies in the fact that the rijrlmn term in each vertex (5.34)
contributes to the amplitude, resulting in the following kinematic factor

indeed, the wave function c(3)

( f5)4 =z d16(cid:16) ( f5)(cid:17)4

(5.39)

similarly terms like ( f5)r2 and (gg)2 in (5.22) can also be obtained as well as
terms involving the fermionic elds. the ( f5)4 and ( f5)r2 vanish in the ads5  s5
background of iib in which f5 is a constant. this is in accord with expectations based on
the ads/cft correspondence [24,25].

the (gg)2 together with the ( f5)4 interaction vertex in nine dimensions, has
a piece which survives the decompactication limit to eleven dimensions and produces a
(f4)4 term in eleven dimensions. this term is a higher derivative correction of the eleven
dimensional supergravity and appears at the same order as r4. the four-point scattering
amplitude of the three-form potential was calculated in [20] using the matrix theory at
one-loop and identied with the classical supergravity result. it would be of interest to
see how the vertex (f4)4 together with other terms (such as the r4 term) arise in matrix
theory.

it would be interesting to use the eleven-dimensional vertices in situations with
nonzero momentum in the eleventh dimension to describe the interactions of d-particles
which should agree with results of [26] obtained by quantization of the massive ten-
dimensional superparticle in static gauge, although we have not checked this. another
interesting generalization would be the formulation of covariant superspace vertex op-
erators for the eleven-dimensional superparticle. this would be a generalization of the
open-string vertex operators of [14].
