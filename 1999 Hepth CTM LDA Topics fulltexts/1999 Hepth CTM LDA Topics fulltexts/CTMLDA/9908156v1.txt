new regularization using domain wall

abstract

we present a new regularization method, for d dim (euclidean) quantum
eld theories in the continuum formalism, based on the domain wall cong-
uration in (1+d) dim space-time. it is inspired by the recent progress in the
chiral fermions on the lattice. the wall height is given by 1/m, where m
is a regularization mass parameter and appears as a 1+d dim dirac fermion
mass. the present approach gives a thermodynamic view to the domain wall
or the overlap formalism in the lattice eld theory. we will show qualitative
correspondence between the present continuum results and those of the lat-
tice. the extra dimension is regarded as the (inverse) temperature t. the
domains are dened by the directions of the system movement, not by the
sign of m as in the original overlap formalism. physically the parameter
m controls both the chirality selection and the dimensional reduction to d
dimension. from the point of regularization, the limit mt  0 regularize the
infra-red behaviour whereas the condition on the momentum (k) integral,
|k|  m, regularize the ultra-violet behaviour.
to check the new regularization works correctly, we take the 4 dim qed
and 2 dim chiral gauge theory as examples. especially the consistent and
covariant anomalies are correctly obtained. the choice of solutions of the
higher dim dirac equation characterize the two anomalies. the projective

1 introduction

regularizing quantum theories respecting the chirality has been a long-
lasting problem both in the discrete and in the continuum eld theories. the
diculty originates from the fact that the chiral symmetry is a symmetry
strongly bound to the space-time dimension and is related to the discrete
symmetry of parity and to the global features of the space-time topology.
non-continuous property is usually dicult to regularize. ordinary regular-
izations, such as the dimensional regularization, often hinder controlling the
chirality. the symmetry should be compared with others such as the gauge
symmetry of the internal space and the lorentz symmetry of the space-time.
in the lattice eld theory, the diculty appears as the doubling problem of
fermions[1] (see a text, say, [2]) and as the nielsen-ninomiya no-go theorem
[3]. the recent very attractive progress in the lattice chiral fermion tells us
the domain wall conguration in one dimension higher space(-time) serves as
a good regularization[4, 5]. it was formulated as the overlap formalism[6, 7]
and was further examined by [8, 9, 10]. the corresponding lattice models
were analyzed by [11, 12, 13, 14, 15]. the numerical data also looks to support
its validity[16]. most recently the overlap dirac operator by neuberger[17],
which satises ginsparg-wilson relation[18], and luschers chiral symmetry
on lattice[19] makes the present direction more and more attractive.

the present motivation is to nd a counter-part, in the continuum,
of the above regularization on lattice. through the analysis we expect to
clarify the essence of the regularization mechanism more transparently than
on lattice. we see some advanced points over the ordinary regularizations
in the continuum eld theories. the main goal is to develop a new feasible
regularization, in the continuum formalism, which is compatible with the
chiral symmetry.

the overlap formalism has been newly formulated using the heat-kernel[20].

the heat-kernel formalism is most eciently expressed in the coordinate
space[21], and which enables us to do comparison with the lattice formalism.
we will often compare the present results with those obtained by the lattice
domain wall approach. the present formalism is based on three key points:

1. we utilize the characteristic relation of heat and temperature, that
is, heat propagates from the high temperature to the low temperature
(the second law of thermodynamics).
in the system which obey the

3

heat equation, there exists a xed direction in the system movement.
we regard the heat equation for the spinor system, after the wick
rotation, as the dirac equation in one dimension higher space-time.
and we consider the (1+4 dim classical) conguration which has a
xed direction in time. this setting is suitable for regularizing the
dynamics (in 4 dim euclidean space) with control of the chirality.

2. anti-commutativity between the system operator d and the chiral ma-
trix, that is, 5 d + d5 = 0 plays the crucial role to separate the whole
conguration into two parts (we will call them (+)-domain and (-
)-domain) which are related by the sign change of the time-axis.
this is contrasted with the original formulation of the overlap where
the dierence of two vacua, one is constructed from the (+) sign reg-
ularization (1+4 dim fermion) mass and the other from the (-) sign,
distinguishes the two domains.

3. taking the small momentum region compared to the regularization
mass scale m regularize the ultra-violet divergences and, at the same
time, controls the chirality.

in this paper we further examine the new approach and strengthen its
basis for the establishment. in order to show that the present approach is a
new regularization for general eld theories, the regularization mechanism is
systematically presented. three kinds of wall congurations appear depend-
ing on the choice of propagators (regularization).
in the regularization of
momentum-integral, some characteristic functions ( sine integral functions,
incomplete gamma functions, etc) appear. because the presented pertur-
bation calculation is not so familiar, the description of calculation is rather
explanatory so that readers can follow them. the main points in the present
analysis are as follows.

1. the extra axis is interpreted as the (inverse) temperature. this formal-
ism gives a thermodynamic view on the domain wall algorithm. as the
extra axis, it should be a half line ( not a line ) like the temperature.

2. the characteristic condition of the present regularization : |k|  |m| 

1/t, is naturally introduced and its role is closely examined.

4

3. the reason why the overlap of |+ > and | > should be taken in
the anomaly calculation is manifest. the overlap in the partition
function corresponds to a dierence in the eective action.

4. this new regularization is applied to 4 dim euclidean qed and 2 dim
chiral gauge theory. especially, in the latter model, both consistent
and covariant anomalies appear depending on the choice of solutions
in the 1+4 dim dirac equation. it is a new characterization of the two
anomalies.

in sec.2 the heat-kernel method is reviewed taking 4 dim euclidean
qed as an example. in sec.3 the new regularization formalism of domain
wall approach is explained. we apply it, in sec.4, to the model of sec.2
and reproduce the result using the domain wall regularization.
in sec.5
the ultraviolet regularization of the momentum integral is closely explained.
some characteristic functions appear. the new regularization is applied to
2 dim chiral gauge theory in sec.6. the consistent and covariant anomalies
are newly characterized. in sec.7 we consider the case of massive fermion.
finally we conclude in sec.8. three appendices are in order. app.a describes
the present notation. some useful integral formulae are listed in app.b.
projective properties of free solutions ( positive and negative energy ) of 1+4
dim dirac equation are displayed in app.c.

2 qed in the heat-kernel approach

we review 4 dim euclidean qed using the heat-kernel approach and x
the present notation. the results will be compared with the domain wall
approach in the following sections. in 1951 schwinger [22] did the heat-kernel
analysis of the (1+3 dim) qed and succeeded in calculating the radiative
corrections in the covariant way. physically some interesting phenomenon of
the vacuum polarization in the strong magnetic eld was pointed out.

we consider the massless euclidean case and focus on its anomaly aspect.

the lagrangian is given by

l = i  /d ,

(i /d) = i /d .

where < x| and |y > are the x-representation of d (diracs bra- and ket-
vectors respectively) which can be well-dened by the complete set of eigen-
functions of d: {fn(x); n = 0, 1,  | dfn(x) = nfn(x)}. the boundary
condition equation in (3) shows the heat kernel regularization. the heat
equation is usually solved in perturbation around the free solution.

(7)

the factor (t) in s(xy; t) guarantees that the system moves in the forward
direction in the proper time t. this property is characteristic of the heat
propagation. this fact will be utilized in a following section and is the
central idea of this paper.

under the innitesimal chiral u(1) transformation:

using the relation (7). (e) is the 1-loop -function of qed. a useful formula
for the calculation of g(x, x; t = +0) in (12) and (13) is given in [24]. (for
the yang-mills theory, -function was obtained in this way in [25].)

3 domain wall approach

let us do the analysis of the previous section (the 4 dim massless euclidean
qed) in the domain wall approach. first we express the eective action in
terms of i( + iea) itself, not its square as in sec.2..

l =  d ,

formally we have

d = i( + iea)

,

d = d .

we should notice that the nal equality above relies only on the following
properties of d and 5:

5 d + d5 = 0 ,

(5)2 = 1

.

(16)

note that, in the nal expression of (15), the signs of the eigenvalues of d
becomes less important ( than the case of the previous section ) for the t-
integral convergence. this is because the exponetial operator et d is replaced

8

by the oscillating operators eit5 d due to the relation (16). here we introduce
two regularization parameters m and m, which are most characteristic in
this approach. 2

eq.(17) from eq.(15) for an innitesimally small value of m (= m ), some m -dependent
terms should appear in the right hand side of the rst equation of (16).
it looks to
correspond to a kind of ginsparg-wilson relation[18].

in subsec.3.1 and 3.2 below. they are obtained by some combinations of the

on-shell momenta( k 2 = k 2 = m 2), which correspond to the positive and
negative energy states respectively. 4 we can rewrite (k) as

corresponds to the overlap dirac operator [17] for the case of no wilson
term. in fact, (k) have projective property with their hermite conjugate.
the relations are listed in app.c and will be eciently used in the following
calculations.

the nal important stage is regularization of the (1-loop) ultra-violet
divergences. (we will explain it in sec.5 in detail.) corresponding to the 1-
loop quantum evaluation, the determinant (15) nally involves one momen-
tum (k)-integral (besides t-integral). we will take the analytic continuation
method in order to avoid introducing further regularization parameters. it
is essentially equivalent to restricting the integral region from 0  |k| < 
to

chiral condition : 0  |k|  m .

(24)

(see sec.5.) this looks similar to the usual pauli-villars procedure in the
point of ultra-violet regularization. m plays the role of the momentum cut-
o. we should stress that this restriction condition (24) on the momentum
integral, at the same time, controls the chirality as explained in the follow-
ing.
( this point is the most distinguished property of the domain wall
regularization.
in the lattice formalism,
this stage corresponds to taking the zero mode (surface state) limit, in order
to avoid the doubling problem, by introducing many avor fermions (or

) we call (24) chiral condition.

3 the relation between 4 dim quantities(x and k) and 1+4 dim ones(x a and k a):
(x a) = (x 0, x  = x), (k a) = (k 0, k  = k), kax a = k0x 0  k x  = k0x 0 +
kx. only for 1+4 dim quantities (capital letters), the upper and lower indices have
meaning.

m + e(k)5 + i /k, m  \k = m  e(k)5 + i /k.

heavy fermions contribution. in fact, taking the extreme chiral limit:

this result will be used for characterizing dierent congurations with re-
spect to the chirality.

we use (24) instead of (25) in the concrete calculation. loosening the
extreme chiral limit (25) to the chiral condition (24) should be regarded as
a part of the present regularization. this part looks to correspond to the
introduction of the wilson term, in the lattice formalism, in order to break
the chiral symmetry. (see the last paragraph of sec.8.)

besides the extreme chiral limit (25), we often consider , corresponding

to (18), the following limit:

direction in the system movement when the temperature parameter works
well (sec.2). assuming the analogy holds here, we try to adopt the following
choice as a possible solution.

this is chosen in such a way that the t-integral converges.
(the oppo-
site choice will be considered in the last part of this section.) as we have
divided a full solution into two chiral parts in order to introduce a xed
direction in the system movement, sf above does not satisfy the proper
propagation equation (21). instead it satises the following ones:

the meaning of the choice of feynman path (29,30) is subtle, because
the solution does not satisfy (i\  m)g5
m . the clear separation of
right and left (fig.2) and its calculational simplicity fascinate us to examine
this path. one purpose of this paper is to nd whether this path works
correctly as regularization or not. ( as will be seen in the following sections, it
works well except a simple factor as far as the chiral anomalies are concerned.
) the same thing can be said about the next paragraph.

m = ie /ag5

as a nal comment of this subsection, we refer to the opposite choice
if we take the

in (29) and (30). we call this choice anti-feynman path.

the regularization using this solution turns out to give the same result as the
feynman path. the dierent point is that, due to the presence of the expone-
tially growing factor e+e(k)t, we must do calculation in the x 0-coordinate.[20]

led to take the following solution.

17

the gures of fig.2,3 and 4 show the present regularization controls the
chirality very well. both in (35) and in (44), the anomalies are expressed
by the dierence between (+)-domain and (-)-domain contributions. this
corresponds to the overlap in the original formalism.

so far we have mainly explained the formalism of the domain wall reg-
ularization. in the following sections, we will explicitly evaluate the chiral
anomalies in 4 dim qed and 2 dim chiral gauge theory using this new domain
wall formalism. surely the known results are reproduced. this shows the cor-
rectness of the present regularization. some dierent regularizations appear
depending on the choice of solutions of the 1+4 dim massive dirac equation.
each choice has its characteristic aspect. the feynman and anti-feynman
pathes are advantageous in that the calculation is simple. especially for the
feynman path, the evaluation can be done in the original t-coordinate (no
need for wick rotation). the clear separation of left and right chirality is
also advantageous. the chiral version of the original theory , which is non-
it is
chiral (hermitian), is automatically treated at the limit m  +.
disadvantageous that the regularization relies on the approximate solution
of the dirac equation as shown in (31). on the other hand the symmetric
path is advantageous in that it relies on the proper solution of the dirac
equation as shown in (42). the conguration of two walls (one at the origin
and the other at the innity for each domain) is similar to the lattice situ-
ation. its disadvantageous point is the calculational complexity. we must
take into account both positive and negative states for every propagator. we
will later see, in sec.6, another important dierence, between the above two
kinds pathes, in relation to the consistent and covariant anomalies.

in the lattice numerical simulation, the best t value of the regular-
ization mass m looks restricted both from the below and from the above
depending on the simulation environment [28, 16]. 6 (m a few gev for
the hadron simulation.) the similar one occurs in the present regularization.
the double limit (18) and (24) or (25) implies

|k|  m 

1

or

|k|  m

.

(45)

in the standpoint of the extra dimension, this limit m  1
t (mt  +0) cor-
responds to , combined with the condition on |k|/m, taking the dimensional
6 a kinematical bound on m , from the requirement of no doublers, was given in

[11, 12].

18

reduction from 1+4 dim to 4 dim (domain wall picture of 4 dim space). in
the regularization view, this limit plays the role of the infrared regularization.
the condition |k|  m should be basically regarded as a control of chirality
because its extreme case, |k|  m, clearly means taking the chiral limit
as explained in (26). its role, from the view of regularization, is the control
of the high momentum region in the divergent momentum integral. many
momentum integrals, appearing in this text, diverge. they are regularized
by the analytic regularization. we will show that it is essentially equivalent
to restricting the integral region to |k|  m. this point will be explained
in sec.5.
the relation (45) is the most characteristic one of the present regular-
ization.
it should be compared with the usual heat-kernel regularization
in (12) and (13) where only the limit t  +0 is taken and the ultravio-
let regularization is done by the simple subtraction of divergences. eq.(45)
shows the delicacy in taking the limit in the the present 1+4 dimensional
regularization scheme. it implies, in the lattice simulation, m should be ap-
propriately chosen depending on the regularization scale (,say, lattice size)
and the momentum-region of 4 dim fermions.

4 anomalies of 4 dim euclidean qed using

domain wall regularization

in this section we explicitly evaluate chiral anomalies. in the process some
divergent integrals will appear. they correspond to the ultraviolet diver-
gences in the local eld theories. its regularization is one of key points of the
present approach and is separately examined in sec.5. only the 2-nd order
(with respect to a) perturbation contributes.

the momentum (q) integral is convergent. this is because we take only
positive (negative) energy states for (+)-domain ((-)-domain). this is one
advantageous point of the feynman path. we can obtain the same result
in the x 0-coordinate [20].
in this case, however, the momentum integral
must be regularized and we take the analytic continuation. (this is always
necessary for the anti-feynman and symmetric path.) since it is one of
important points of the present regularization, we explain it separately in
the next section.

finally we obtain the abj anomaly as one fourth of (12). 8

8 the discrepant factor 1/4 comes from the fact that the feynman path is not the
proper solution as commented in subsec.3.1.
if we allowed to consider in the extreme
chiral limit, hoping that the chiral anomaly itself is a topological object and does not
depend on the continuous parameter m , we can explain the factor as follows. for each
vertex, instead of /a = 1+5
/a, we consider half of it ( the right-part for feynman
). therefore ( 1

the weyl anomaly can be evaluated using the second equation of (35)

need to consider the parity-even terms instead of the odd ones (5 terms)

can be treated in a common framework. details will be published elsewhere.

the present regularization, in the momentum integral, typically do the
following things: 1) (exponetially) divergent functions, due to negative
eigenvalues, are rst replaced by oscillating ones (fig.appc, above) using
the wick rotation (x 0 = it) and then 2) the large momentum (|k|  m)
region is made to be exponentially damped (fig.appc, below) by the
-factor (or the analytic continuation). finally we take 3) the limit
mt  +0 or mx 0  0. steps 1) and 2) are for ultra-violet regularization
whereas 3) is for infrared one.

let us consider 2 dim chiral non-abelian gauge theory and analyze its
anomaly in the present domain wall approach. its consistent and covariant

in the lattice approach, the superiority of the domain wall fermion (to

the ordinary wilson fermion) is no need to ne-tune the hopping parameter
which suers from the renormalization due to the gauge interaction. in
addition to the wave-function and coupling renormalizations, the mass
renormalization is one crucial test of the superiority. we can calculate such
an eect using the above formulae. the full consideration, however, can be

8 conclusion and discussion

inspired by the recent progress of the chiral fermion on lattice, we have
presented a new regularization, for the continuum euclidean eld theories,
which is based on the domain wall conguration in one dimension higher
(minkowski) space. we have veried the analogous aspect to the lattice
case, such as the domain wall structure, the condition on the 1+4 dim
dirac mass (the regularization parameter m), the overlap dirac operator,
etc. applying the proposed regularization to some models (4 dim qed, 2
dim chiral gauge theory), the known anomalies are correctly reproduced. it
shows the present regularization correctly works.

we make some additional comments about the characteristic features of

the present domain wall regularization.

 the higher dimensional dirac eld mass m is the only regularization
parameter used here. it should satisfy the condition (45) in order to
do the following role: 1) controlling the chirality, 2) forming the
domain wall conguration (dimensional reduction), 3) ultraviolet and
infrared regularization for the momentum integral.

 there appears dierent regularizations depending on the solutions of

the higher dim dirac equation. the feynman path is (practically)
appropriate for the analysis of chiral properties, although overall
factors of anomalies deviate from the right ones.. the calculation is
most simple. whereas the symmetric path gives the proper solution
of the dirac equation and the regularization with the path gives the
correct anomaly including the coecient. especially the covariant
anomaly is obtained only by the choice of the symmetric path and the
hermitian vertex. other choices essentially lead to the consistent
anomaly.

 the characteristic functions appearing in the present regularization,
such as the incomplete gamma function, indicate the advance over
other ordinary regularizations, say, the dimensional one where only
the gamma function appears.

the chiral problem itself does not depend on the interaction. it looks a

kinematical problem in the quantization of elds. how do we treat the

38

dierent propagations of free solutions depending on the boundary
conditions is crucial to the problem. in the standpoint of the operator
formalism (the fock-space formalism) it corresponds to how to treat the
delicate structure (due to the ambiguity of the fermion mass sign) of the
vacuum of the free fermion theory. the anomaly phenomena concretely
reveal the chiral problem although they are secondary aspects of the
problem.

the recent progress in the lattice formalism, using the neubergers

overlap dirac operator[17] and luschers chiral symmetry on lattice[19], has
revealed the importance of the condition on m, where the anomaly
coecient varies depending on the dierent conditions of m. m is bounded
by the wilson parameter in some ways[33, 34, 35, 36]. it shows whether the
zero mode (surface state) is correctly picked up in the regularization
crucially depends on the condition on m. note that there is not the wilson
term in the present formalism. even such case we have the similar
condition (45) which produces the correct coecient. this strongly implies
the present regularization eectively does the same thing as the wilson
term does in the lattice formalism.

appendix a. notations

in the analysis of the chiral property, much care should be paid to 1 and
i. the physical interpretation of the nal result heavily relies on such
delicacy. in this circumstance, we decide to present the present notation in
this appendix. we adopt the convention of ref.[7] for the gamma matrices
() and the metric in 2 and 4 dim euclidean space and for those (a) in 5
dim minkowski space.

appendix c. projective properties of (k)

e(k) = k2 + m 2, ( k a) = (e(k), k  = k), ( k a) = (e(k),k  = k).

k is the momentum in the 4 dim euclidean space. k and k are on-shell
momenta, of 1+4 dim dirac equation, ( k 2 = k 2 = m 2), which correspond
