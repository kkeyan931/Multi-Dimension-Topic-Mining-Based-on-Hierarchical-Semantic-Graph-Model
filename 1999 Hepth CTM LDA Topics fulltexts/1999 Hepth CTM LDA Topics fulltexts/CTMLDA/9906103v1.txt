abstract

we nd general non-linear lagrangians of a u(1) eld invariant under electric-
magnetic duality. they are characterized by an arbitrary function and go to the
maxwell theory in the weak eld limit. we give some explicit examples which are
generalizations of the born-infeld theory.

1 introduction

in exploring non-perturbative aspects of various kinds of theories dualities play im-
portant roles. the montonen-olive duality interchanges the electric charge (e) and the
magnetic charge (q = n/e) relating the strong and the weak couplings [1]. seiberg and
witten showed that this duality is held exactly at the quantum level due to the supersym-
metries and it is crucial for the models to be solvable [2]. the montonen-olive duality
can be lifted to the sl(2,z) duality by taking into account of the gauge coupling and
the theta angle [3]. there exists similar duality in string theories called s-duality which
interchanges the strong and weak string couplings, and can be also lifted to the sl(2,z)
duality[4]. the string duality is reduced to the electric-magnetic duality in 4 dimensions
[5, 6].

after the discovery of d-branes [7] in string theories the born-infeld type actions are
discussed extensively. the s-duality of the string theory causes the electric-magnetic
duality of d3-branes [8, 9]. the self-duality of the d3-brane is conrmed since the dirac-
born-infeld action is symmetric under the electric-magnetic rotations as is the maxwell
action.

among these dualities the most fundamental and familiar one is the electric-magnetic
duality. the electric-magnetic duality is a symmetry of the free maxwell equations under
rotations of the electric and the magnetic elds.
in general it is a symmetry of the
equations of motion for the u(1) elds and the bianchi identities. although the invariance
of the equations of motion does not mean that of the action generally it becomes a
symmetry of the action when it is expressed as a transformation of the potentials [10, 11].
in general the electric-magnetic duality can be lifted to sl(2,r) duality [12, 13].

the duality condition is examined as sp(2n,r) invariance in [14] for n-plet of u(1)
gauge elds coupling with scalars. the born-infeld theory is an example possessing the
duality. it is shown that there exist families of duality invariant lagrangians [15] and the
form of general solutions are discussed in [16]. however the closed forms, beyond the
born-infeld one, have not seem to be found so far.2

there is an alternative approach which manifests the duality invariance [17, 18]. in
addition to the u(1) eld the dual potential is introduced. they are not independent
but satisfy some constraints. in this approach the duality transformations are rotations
between two potentials and the invariance is easily implemented. on the other hand the
manifest lorentz invariance is sacriced for the manifest duality. the lorentz invariance
of the equation of motions is expressed as a condition on the lagrangians. the manifest
lorentz covariant approach, for the maxwell theory, has been developed in [19]. it may
be applied to the general cases once the lorentz invariance of the non-covariant theories
are guaranteed.

in this paper we rst review the conditions on lagrangians in both approaches, one in
manifestly lorentz invariant and other in manifestly duality invariant. they are reduced

2[15] gives one which does not have maxwell weak eld limit.

to a same dierential equation. the non-linear equation has general solutions character-
ized by an arbitrary function of one variable, f (u). thus general forms of lagrangians are
found by some algebraic tasks for both approaches. all of them can have their weak eld
limit to the maxwell theory. a choice of constant f (u) naturally leads to the born-infeld
theory. we present some explicit examples which are one parameter families of gener-
alized born-infeld actions in the sense that they reduce to the born-infeld action for a
choice of the parameters in f (u). ones which are not born-infeld type actions are also
found.

the invariant lagrangians beyond born-infeld one do not have simple forms.

it is
not convenient to use them practically. an advantage of our formulation is that we can
rewrite the general lagrangians in alternative forms using with auxiliary variable. they are
equivalent since the original lagrangians ( equations of motion ) follow when the auxiliary
variable is eliminated using its equation of motion. these forms of the lagrangians are
much simpler and will be useful in the development of the general theory.

in next section we give a brief review of the duality conditions in the manifestly
lorentz invariant approach and in the manifestly duality invariant one. it is shown that
both conditions are reduced to a same simple non-linear dierential equation. in section
3 we solve it and establish a prescription to nd the invariant lagrangians. it is applied
to nd some examples in closed forms in section 4. in section 5 we nd the forms of the
general invariant lagrangians with auxiliary variable. summary and discussions are given
in the last section.

2 conditions of duality and lorentz invariances

the electric-magnetic duality is an invariance under so(2) rotations of the eld

strength f and its dual k dened by3

 k  =

l
f

.

(2.2)

in this paper we consider a pure u(1) gauge theory without matter eld for simplicity.
the innitesimal duality transformation is

f = k,

k =  f.

(2.3)

since the set of eld equation  k  = 0 and bianchi identity  f  = 0 are invariant
under it the condition of duality is the invariance of the dening relation of k in (2.2). it

3 our conventions are

 f

f

has been examined in general matter coupling theories [14]. the compatibility condition
of this transformation with the denition (2.2) is

f  f + k  k = 0.

(2.4)

although it does not mean the invariance of the action it can be shown that it is indeed a
symmetry transformation of the action when it is interpreted as a transformation of the
u(1) potentials [10, 11].

the gaillard-zumino condition (2.4) is expressed as a dierential equation for the
lagrangians. in the lorentz covariant formulation the lagrangians are functions of f f
and ff , assuming that they are u(1) gauge invariant and do not depend on higher
derivatives,

l = l(t, z),

t

4

ff ,

z

f  f .

using (2.2) the dual eld strength is

k = lt f + lz  f,  k =  lt  f + lz f

(2.5)

(2.6)

where lt = l
equation of l [16]

t , etc. and the gaillard-zumino condition (2.4) is expressed as a dierential

z l2

t  2t lz lt  z l2

z  z = 0.

the maxwell and born-infeld lagrangians

l(m ) = t,
are solutions of (2.7) respectively.

l(bi) = 1 

1 + 2t  z2.

(2.7)

(2.8)

in the above lorentz invariant approach the duality is not manifest. there is an al-
ternative approach in which the duality invariance is manifest. in addition to the u(1)
potential a(1)
 . the duality transformation is real-

ized as so(2) rotation mixing two potentials. in this form the duality can be satised
manifestly while the lorentz invariance is not. the schwarz-sen lagrangian [17] for the
maxwell theory is generalized as [18]

it is introduced a dual potential a(2)

lss =

1
2lbi()e()

i  h,

(2.9)

i = f ()

0j , bi() = 1

where e()
jk and l12 = l21 = 1. h is a function of bi() and
is invariant under so(2) rotations of the two potentials (with the indices ( = 1, 2)) and
the spatial 3d rotations (with the indices (i = 1, 2, 3)). it is a function of t and y dened
by

2 ijkf ()

t =

((b(1))

+ (b(2))

),

y =

(ijkb(1)

j b(2)

k )2.

(2.10)

h(t, y) plays a role of (non-vanishing part of) the hamiltonian in the canonical formalism.

the variation of the action with respect to a()

0

leads to identities

ibi() = 0,

( = 1, 2).

using this redundancy of the a()

0

the equations of motion of a()

i

are reduced to

ijkj(le()

k 

h
bk() ) = 0

(le()

k 

h
bk() ) = 0.

(2.11)

(2.12)

(2.13)

these equations of motion give the relation between e()s and b()s and (generalized)
maxwell equations, which follow from the bianchi identities f () = 0.

the lagrangian (2.9) does not have manifest lorentz invariance. it is guaranteed by

that of the equations of motion (2.13) under the lorentz boost

e()

i

= ijkwjbk(),

bi() = ijkwje()
k .

the condition is expressed as a dierential equation for h(t, y),

h 2

t + 2t ht hy + 2y h 2

y  1 = 0.

(2.14)

(2.15)

it has also been derived from the conservation of the energy momentum tensors[18]. the
maxwell and born-infeld theories are described by h with

h (m ) = t,

h (bi) = q1 + 2t + 2y  1,

(2.16)

which are two solutions of (2.15).

we have obtained two dierential equations in dierent approaches, one is (2.7) in
a manifest lorentz invariant formalism and the other is (2.15) in the manifest duality
invariant formalism. they are related by a change of variables

and4

y = 

1
2

z2

l(t, z) = h(t, y).

(2.17)

(2.18)

it is interesting to see these systems are governed by essentially same dierential equations
(2.7) and (2.15). it is also noted the physical region of the variable y in (2.10) is positive

4 the signs of l and h are not determined by (2.7) and (2.15). they are chosen by convention.

4

while the relation (2.17) requires the continuation of y to negative region. same is true
for ts in (2.5) and in (2.10).

a purpose of this paper is to nd invariant lagrangians by solving (2.7) and/or (2.15).

they are further simplied by introducing new variable x

and

x = t2 + z2 = qt2  2y

l(t, z) =  h(t, y) = k(t, x).

(2.19)

(2.20)

in terms of new function k(t, x) both dierential equations (2.7) and (2.15) become

t  k2
k2

x  1 = 0.

(2.21)

the same dierential equation has been obtained using geometrical consideration in[15].
in terms of the function k(t, x) the maxwell and born-infeld lagrangians are

k(m ) = t,

k(bi) = 1 q(1 + t)2  x2.

(2.22)

3 general solutions

the general solution of the dierential equation (2.21) have been discussed in [16] and
a prescription to obtain the invariant lagrangians is presented. in this section we give an
alternative form of the general solutions.

the dierential equation (2.21) will be solved by setting kt =  cosh , kx = sinh 

and tanh  = u,

kt =

1

q1  u(t, x)2

,

kx =

u(t, x)

q1  u(t, x)2

.

(3.1)

here the sign of kt is chosen to be negative for the maxwell limit (see (2.22)). they verify
(2.21) trivially while it requires an integrability condition

ut(t, x) + u(t, x) ux(t, x) = 0.

(3.2)

this is familiar non-linear equation and the general solution is obtained by solving arbi-
trary implicit function of two variables u and x  tu for u [20]. let g(u) be an arbitrary
function of u and solve

x  t u = g(u)

(3.3)

5

for u. it is a solution of (3.2) and k(t, x) is found by integrating (3.1). the k(t, x) obtained
in this procedure solves (2.21) thus found the corresponding duality invariant lagrangians
through (2.20). (3.2) is proved by taking derivatives of (3.3) with respect to t and x

ut =

u

t + g(u)

,

ux =

1

t + g(u)

.

(3.4)

the arbitrariness of g(u) is understood by regarding (3.2) as a t-evolution equation. at
time t = 0 the initial data u(0, x)  g1(x) is taken arbitrarily. the u(t, x) at later time
is determined as long as the dierentiability is maintained.

suppose (3.3) is solved for u for a given g(u). in order to integrate (3.1) it is convenient

to make change of the variables

(t, x)  (t, u),

k(t, u)  k(t, x).

using (3.1) and (3.4)

kt(t, u) = 

1  u2,

ku(t, u) =

u (t + g(u))

1  u2

,

(3.5)

(3.6)

whose integrability is now guaranteed by (3.3). the rst of (3.6) is integrated with respect
to t

k(t, u) =  t 1  u2 + g(u)

and g(u) is determined by using the second of (3.6);

g(u) =

.

u g(u)

1  u2

it may be integrated by changing the integration variable from u to u = 1  u2

g(u) = z du { g(1  u2)} + const.

(3.7)

(3.8)

(3.9)

we can summarize our result as follows. since g(u) is arbitrary we start choosing an

arbitrary function f (u)  g(u). g(u) and k(t, u) are determined in terms of f (u) as

g(u) = z u

0

du f (u) + c1

and

k(t, u) =  t 1  u2  z

1

1u2

du f (1  u2) + c2.

(3.10)

(3.11)

the solution k(t, x) of (2.21) is determined by solving (3.3), x  tu = g(u), with g(u)
given by (3.10), for u(t, x).

6

two integration constants in (3.10) and (3.11) are determined if we impose a condition
that its weak eld limit gives the maxwell theory. since the maxwell theory is described
by k(t, x) in (2.22),

k(m )(t, x) = t,  kt = 1  u = 0,

(3.12)

then (3.3) for the weak eld t = x = 0 must have the solution u = 0. this condition
determines the integration constant c1 in (3.10) and c2 in (3.11) as

g(0) = c1 = 0,

c2 = 0.

(3.13)

4 examples

in principle for a given function f (u) we can nd the corresponding lagrangians,
manifestly lorentz invariant l(t, z) in (2.5) and manifestly duality invariant lss in (2.9).
however there are two obstructions practically. one is to solve (3.3) algebraically for
u. second is to integrate (3.10) and (3.11) explicitly. there is some limitations on the
arbitrary function f (u) to have closed forms of the lagrangians. the situation is similar
in the method by gaillard and zumino [16] and they didnt give explicit example beyond
the born-infeld lagrangian.
in this section we present some examples for which their
lagrangians are found in closed forms.

4.1 maxwell and born-infeld theories

the simplest choice of f (u) may be a constant,

f (u) =

1
b

,

where b is a constant. from (3.10) and (3.11) g(u) and g(u) are determined as

g(u) = z u
g(u) =  z

we can consider two limiting cases. the a = 0 naturally leads to the born-infeld
lagrangian as is expected from the form of f (u) in (4.10). actually k(t, x) in (4.15) goes
to that of born-infeld theory in an obvious manner.

5 lagrangians with an auxiliary variable

in the last section we presented some examples for which their lagrangians are given
in closed forms. as was seen they are not simple enough for practical applications. it
mainly came from the necessity of solving the equation for u, (3.3),

x  t u = g(u).

(5.1)

in this section we propose an alternative formulation in which this equation is treated as
a constraint. we construct a lagrangian which is equivalent, at least classically, to (3.11)
and (3.3),

l(u, t, x) = 

t  u x
1  u2 z u

0

g(r)
(1  r2)

3

2

dr.

(5.2)

here u is regarded as an independent variable and g(u) is the arbitrary function of
previous sections satisfying g(0) = 0. by taking a variation of the lagrangian with
respect to u we obtain (5.1) as the equation of motion. if it would be solved for u and
is used in the lagrangian (5.2), l(u(t, x), t, x) becomes k(t, x) in (3.11). actually the
lagrangian (5.2) is k(t, u) of (3.7) in which g(u) is replaced as follows,

g(u) = z u

0

dr

r g(r)

1  r2

=



0

u g(u)

1  u2 z u
u (x  ut)
1  u2 z u

0

dr

g(r)
(1  r2)

dr g(r)(

r

)

1  r2

.

3

2

(5.3)

here g(u) is replaced by (x  ut) only in the rst term of r.h.s..

the lagrangian l(u, t, x) in (5.2) is often useful since the equation for u (5.1) is built
in the lagrangian in stead of imposing by hand. in this form it is not always necessary to
solve the equation for u (5.1) explicitly for many purposes. especially in quantum theory
(5.1) may be left as a constraint rather than a strong equality.

in the lagrangian (5.2) g(u) is arbitrary except g(0) = 0.6 we can regard the last

term as arbitrary function m(u) subject to the boundary condition

and the general form of duality invariant lagrangian is given by

m(0) = m(0) = 0

l(u, t, x) =

6more correctly g(u) = 0 gives a solution u = 0, see the discussion of (3.12). for example a model

m(0) = m(0) = 0.

(5.6)

or equivalently it is expressed, using u = tanh , by
l(, t, x) = t cosh  + x sinh  + m (),

with g(u)  0 gives u = x/t and does not have the maxwell limit.

in this paper we have shown that electric-magnetic duality and lorentz invariant
lagrangians are constructed from solutions of the simple non-linear dierential equation
(3.2). the general solutions are obtained and are characterized by the function f (u).
the manifest lorentz invariant lagrangian and the manifest duality invariant one are
respectively given by (2.20). we constructed some examples in closed forms explicitly.
examples 2, 4 and 5 are one parameter families of generalized born-infeld lagrangians.
although they go back to the born-infeld lagrangian for a  0 limit they have subtly
dierent weak eld expansions. the example 3 have dierent properties from others and
do not have the limit to the born-infeld lagrangian.

in [16] gaillard and zumino have given a prescription to nd the general solution of
the same dierential equation (2.21). it is characterized by one arbitrary function v(s) as

l =

2p
v(s)

+ v(s),

t = p + q, x = p  q,

(6.1)

12

where s(p, q) is determined by solving

q =

p

(v(s))2 + s

for s. the relation is found by comparing the (variation of) lagrangians as follows,

x  tu = g(u)

l

q = p

v(s)2 + s

l

(6.2)

(6.3)

u = u(t, x)

 u = v(s)21

v(s)2+1



s = s(p, q)

this diagram relates the arbitrary functions g(u) and v(s). for example for the born-
infeld case it is solved as

g(u) =

u

b  v(s) = s 1

1 + 2 b s

.

(6.4)

for a given k(t, x) we can make both manifestly lorentz invariant formulation with
the lagrangian l(t, x) in (2.5) and manifestly duality invariant one with l(ss) in (2.9). it
is interesting to know whether these two lagrangians are describing same system or not.
since (2.18) is simply a relation of functional forms of two lagrangians in our formalism
it is not evident that they are equivalent. the equivalence is discussed in [18] that the
latter is derived from the former. it is explicit that ks in (2.22) are giving ls in (2.8)
and hs in (2.16) of the maxwell and the born-infeld theories.

an advantage of our formulation is that it lead to the general form of the lagrangians
in (5.2) ( or (5.5) and (5.6) ) characterized by the arbitrary function with its boundary
condition. it contains auxiliary variable u which is determined by its equation of motion
(5.1). it is equivalent to the lagrangian in which u is solved as function of t and x. using
with the auxiliary variable the lagrangian has relatively simple form and much easier to be
handled. these forms of lagrangians may be useful in development of the general duality
invariant theories.
