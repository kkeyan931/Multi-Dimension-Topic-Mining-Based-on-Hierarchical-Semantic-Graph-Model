we investigate the relevance of eisenstein series for representing certain g(z)-invariant
string theory amplitudes which receive corrections from bps states only. g(z) may stand
for any of the mapping class, t-duality and u-duality groups sl(d, z), so(d, d, z) or
ed+1(d+1)(z) respectively. using g(z)-invariant mass formulae, we construct invariant
modular functions on the symmetric space k\g(r) of non-compact type, with k the max-
imal compact subgroup of g(r), that generalize the standard non-holomorphic eisenstein
series arising in harmonic analysis on the fundamental domain of the poincare upper half-
plane. comparing the asymptotics and eigenvalues of the eisenstein series under second
order dierential operators with quantities arising in one- and g-loop string amplitudes,
we obtain a manifestly t-duality invariant representation of the latter, conjecture their
non-perturbative u-duality invariant extension, and analyze the resulting non-perturbative
eects. this includes the r4 and r4h 4g4 couplings in toroidal compactications of m-
theory to any dimension d  4 and d  6 respectively.

while worldsheet modular invariance has played a major role in the context of perturbative
string theory since its early days, the advent of target space and non-perturbative dual-
ities has brought into play yet another branch of the mathematics of automorphic forms
invariant under innite discrete groups.
indeed, physical amplitudes should depend on
scalar elds usually taking values (in theories with many supersymmetries) in a symmetric
space k\g(r), where k is the maximal compact subgroup of g, while duality identies
points in k\g(r) diering by the right action of an innite discrete subgroup g(z) of
g(r). this includes in particular the mapping class group sl(d, z) in the case of toroidal
compactications of dieomorphism-invariant theories, the t-duality group so(d, d, z) in
toroidal compactications of string theories, as well as the non-perturbative u-duality group
ed+1(d+1)(z) in maximally supersymmetric compactied m-theory [1, 2, 3] (see for instance
[4, 5] for reviews and exhaustive list of references). moreover, supersymmetry constrains
certain bps saturated amplitudes to be eigenmodes of second order dierential opera-
tors [6, 7, 8], so that harmonic analysis on such spaces provides a powerful tool for under-
standing these quantities. in the most favorable case, it can be used to determine exact
non-perturbative results not obtainable otherwise, which can then be analyzed at weak
coupling [9, 10]. other exact results can also be obtained from string-string duality, al-
though in a much less general way, since one needs to be able to control the result on
one side of the duality map. this approach was taken for vacua with 16 supersymmetries
in [11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18]. in both cases, one generically obtains a few perturba-

3

tive leading terms which can in principle be checked against a loop computation, whereas
the non-perturbative contributions correspond to instantonic saddle points of the unknown
string eld theory. a number of hints for the rules of semi-classical calculus in string
theory have been extracted from these results [19, 20] and reproduced in matrix models
[21, 22, 23], but a complete prescription is still lacking. a better understanding of such
eects would be very welcome, as it would for instance allow quantitative computations of
perturbatively-forbidden processes in cases of more immediate physical relevance.

the prototypical example was proposed by green and gutperle, who conjectured that
the r4 couplings in ten-dimensional type iib theory were exactly given by an s-duality
invariant result [9]

where in the rst expression  = a + i/gs = 1 + i2 is the complexied string coupling
transforming as a modular parameter under sl(2, z)s and lp = g1/4
ls the s-duality invariant
ten-dimensional planck length. this result is interpreted in the second expression as a sum
over the solitonic (p, q) strings of tension t(p,q) = |p + q|/l2
in particular, the scaling
s.
dimension 8 + 3  2 is appropriate for an r4 coupling in ten dimensions. the invariant
function in (1.1) is a particular case s = 3/2 of a set of non-holomorphic automorphic forms

also known as eisenstein series, which together with a discrete set of cusp forms generate
the spectrum of the laplacian on the fundamental domain of the upper half-plane, within
the set of modular functions increasing at most polynomially as 2   (see [24] for an
elementary introduction):

(1.3)

cusp forms are exponentially suppressed at large 2, and lie at discrete values along the
s = 1/2 + ir axis, although no explicit form is known for them. eisenstein series on the
other hand can be expanded at weak coupling (large 2) by poisson resummation on the
integer m (see appendix c for useful formulae):

for s = 3/2, this exhibits a tree-level and one-loop term which can be checked against a
perturbative computation, together with an innite series of instantonic eects, from the
saddle point expansion (c.3) of the modied bessel function k1:

(1.5)

where e = gs denotes the type iib coupling. these eects can be interpreted as arising
from d-instantons and anti-d-instantons [9]. as suggested in [25], one can in fact prove
that the 32 supersymmetries of type iib imply that the exact r4 coupling should be an
eigenmode of the laplacian on the moduli space u(1)\sl(2, r), with a denite eigenvalue
(3/8 in the conventions of the present paper) [26, 6, 8], which uniquely selects out the
s = 3/2 eisenstein series. in particular, it rules out contributions from cusp forms, which
on the basis of the leading perturbative terms alone would have been acceptable [6].

whereas harmonic analysis on the fundamental domain of the upper half-plane u(1)\
sl(2, r)/sl(2, z) is rather well understood, it is not so for the more general symmetric
spaces of interest in string theory (see however [27, 28]). it is the purpose of this work to
generalize these considerations to more elaborate cases, corresponding to a larger moduli
space and discrete symmetry group. such situations arise in compactications with 16 or
32 supersymmetries, where supersymmetry prevents corrections to the scalar manifold. as
we mentioned, this is the case of toroidal compactications of string theories, with (part of
the) moduli space [so(d)  so(d)]\so(d, d, r)/so(d, d, z), or of m-theory, with moduli
space k\ed+1(d+1)(r)/ed+1(d+1)(z). this also happens in more complicated cases, such
as type iia on k3, with moduli space r+  [so(4)  so(20)\so(4, 20, r)] identied by
the so(4, 20, z) (perturbative) mirror symmetry, or type iib on k3, with moduli space
[so(5)  so(21)]\so(5, 21, r) identied by the non-perturbative symmetry so(5, 21, z).
it is even possible to have uncorrected tree-level scalar manifolds in theories with 8 super-
symmetries, as in the fhsv model [29], with a moduli space k\[sl(2, r) so(2, 10, r)
so(4, 12, r)] where k is the obvious maximal compact subgroup. note that in this case
the duality group is broken to a subgroup of so(2, 10, z)  so(4, 12, z), due to the eect
of the freely acting orbifold. usually however, in cases with 8 supersymmetries, ampli-
tudes are given by sections of a symplectic bundle on the corrected moduli space, and our
methods will not carry over in a straightforward way.

this generalization was in fact started in ref. [10], where toroidal compactications of
type iib string theory down to 7 or 8 dimensions were considered. it was demonstrated
there that the straightforward extension of the order 3/2 eisenstein series (1.2) to the u-
duality groups sl(5, z) and sl(3, z) reproduces the tree-level and one-loop r4 thresholds,

5

together with (p, q)-string instantons. a generalization to lower dimensional cases was
also proposed, and a distinct route using successive t-dualities was taken in ref.
[30] to
obtain the contribution of the o(e1/gs) d-brane instantons in the toroidally compactied
type iia and iib theories; it was also pointed out that s-duality suggests extra o(e1/g2
s )
contributions yet to be understood.
in the present work, we will take a more general
approach, and investigate the properties and utility of the generalized eisenstein series,
that we dene for any symmetric space k\g(r) and any representation r of g by

e g(z)
r;s (g) = xmr\{0}

(m  m) (cid:2)m  rtr(g)  m(cid:3)s .

(1.6)

here, g denotes an element in the coset k\g(r), m a vector in an integer lattice r
transforming in the representation r.  is an integer-valued product on the lattice, such
that the condition m  m = 0 projects the symmetric tensor product r s r onto its
highest irreducible component, thus keeping only the completely symmetric part. this
denition is to be contrasted with the one used in the mathematical literature [28]:

e g(z)
{wi} (g) = xhg(z)/n

r

yi=1

ai(gh)wi

(1.7)

where wi is now an arbitrary r-dimensional vector in weight space, and a(g) is the abelian
component of g in the iwasawa decomposition of the rank-r non-compact group g(r) =
k  a  n into maximal compact k, abelian a and nilpotent n subgroups. note that this
denition is manifestly k-invariant on the left and g(z)-invariant on the right. choosing
w along a highest-weight vector r associated to a representation r reduces (1.7) to (1.6)
where w = sr, up to an s-dependent factor. this generalizes the equality in (1.1) to
higher rank groups. the denition (1.6), albeit less general, has a clearer physical meaning:
the lattice r labels the set of bps states in the representation r of the duality group,
m2 = m  rtr(g)  m gives their mass squared (or tension), and m  m = 0 imposes the
half-bps condition; this will be shown to be a necessary requirement for the eigenmode
condition k\g e g(z)
r;s , but could be dropped if one were to address nonhalf-bps
saturated amplitudes.

r;s  e g(z)

the outline of this paper is as follows. in section 2, we will discuss the simplest case of
sl(d, z) eisenstein series, where most of the features arise without the complications in the
parametrization of the moduli space. in section 3, we will turn to so(d, d, z) eisenstein
series, and discuss their applications for the computation of t-duality invariant one-loop
thresholds of string theories compactied on a torus t d. in section 4, we covariantize this
expression to obtain exact non-perturbative r4 couplings in toroidal compactications of
m-theory to d  4. in section 5, we apply the same techniques to the g-loop threshold,

6

and use it to deduce r4h 4g4 exact couplings in the same theory. computational details
will be relegated to the appendices. this work appeared on the archive simultaneously
with ref. [31], which uses similar techniques, albeit with a dierent motivation.

2 toroidal compactication and sl(d, z) eisenstein series

2.1 moduli space and iwasawa gauge

innite discrete symmetries appear in the simplest setting in compactications of a dieo-
morphism invariant eld theory on a torus t d. specifying the internal manifold requires a
at metric on the torus, that is a positive denite metric g. equivalently we may specify
a vielbein e  gl(d, r) such that g = ete, dened up to orthogonal rotations so(d, r)
acting on the left, which leave g invariant. this gauge invariance can be xed thanks to
the iwasawa decomposition

gl(d, r) = so(d, r)  (r+)d  nd,

(2.1)

where (r+)d denotes the abelian group of diagonal d  d matrices with positive non zero
entries, and nd the nilpotent group of upper triangular matrices with unit diagonal, by
choosing e in the last two factors, i.e. in an upper triangular form. the abelian part
corresponds to the radii of the torus, whereas nd parametrizes the wilson lines aj
i of the
kaluzaklein gauge eld gi.

by general covariance, the kaluzaklein reduction of the eld theory on the torus only
involves contractions with the metric gij, so that the reduced theory is invariant under a
symmetry h  gl(d, r) which transforms g in the representation g  htgh. the vielbein
on the other hand is acted upon on the right, e  eh, which has to be compensated
by a eld-dependent so(d, r) gauge transformation e  (e, h)e to preserve the upper
triangular form. transforming by an element h  1 in the center of gl(d, r) corresponds
to changing the volume, whereas an sl(d, r) transformation aects the torus shape. this
change is not always physical however, since an sl(d, z) rotation can be compensated by a
global dieomorphism of the torus, i.e. an element of the mapping class group. the toroidal
compactication is therefore parametrized by the symmetric space

r+  [so(d, r)\sl(d, r)/sl(d, z)]

(2.2)

and all physical amplitudes should be invariant under sl(d, z). in particular, the eective
action including the massive kaluzaklein modes will only be invariant under sl(d, z), and
not gl(d, r).

7

2.2 fundamental and antifundamental eisenstein series

keeping the above in mind, it is now straightforward to generalize the sl(2, z) eisenstein
series (1.2) to the fundamental representation of sl(d, z) as

e sl(d,z)

d;s

=

xmi (cid:2)migijmj(cid:3)s

,

(2.3)

where the subscript d stands for the representation in which the integers mi, i = 1 . . . d
transform. in fact, the above form is really a gl(d, z) eisenstein series since we did not
restrict g to have unit determinant, but the dependence on vd = det g is trivial so we
shall keep with this abuse of language. the sl(d, z)-invariant form in (2.3) is easily seen
to be an eigenmode of the laplacian 1 on the scalar manifold (2.2):

gl(d) e sl(d,z)

d;s

s(2s  d + 1)

(2.4a)

(2.4b)

in fact, it is more appropriate to restrict to the so(d, r)\sl(d, r) moduli, in terms of
which

sl(d) =

(2.5a)

(2.5b)

here we may wonder why we should choose the integers m to lie in the fundamental
representation d of sl(d). choosing m to transform in the antifundamental representation,

e sl(d,z)

d;s

=

xmi (cid:2)migijmj(cid:3)s ,

(2.6)

does not bring much novelty, since a poisson resummation over all integers mi brings us
back to eq. (2.3), albeit with a transformed order s  d/2  s:

e sl(d,z)

d;s

=

vds( d

2  s)
2 s(s)

d



e sl(d,z)

2 s

d; d

(2.7)

note that the two series e sl(d,z)
have the same eigenvalue under sl(d), but
dierent eigenvalues under gl(d). this simply stems from their dierent dependence on
the volume, and is not sucient to lift their degeneracy under the sl(d) laplacian.

and e sl(d,z)

d;s

d;s

1in all expressions for the laplacians in the main text of the paper we employ the convention that /gij
is taken with respect to the diagonally rescaled metric gij = (1  ij/2)gij, and for simplicity of notation
we omit the tilde. as explained in appendix a, this redenition has the advantage that unrestricted sums
can be used.

8

2.3 higher representations and constrained eisenstein series

we may also choose m to transform in a higher dimensional representation, i.e. as a tensor
mij... with prescribed symmetry properties. in order to determine whether we still get an
eigenmode, it is useful to take a more algebraic approach. we consider acting with the
laplacian on the integral representation

(cid:2)mtmm(cid:3)s =

s

(s)z 

0

dt

t1+s exp(cid:16)


t

mtmm(cid:17)

(2.8)

where m = rtr denotes the mass matrix in the representation r. deriving only once in
the exponential yields the action of the laplacian on m, which transforms as a symmetric
tensor product r s r.
in order to get an eigenmode, this tensor product should be
irreducible when contracted with the charges m. this puts a quadratic constraint on m,
which we generically denote m  m = 0. in other words, m  m = 0 projects onto the
highest irreducible component of the symmetric tensor product r s r. one may want
to drop the quadratic constraint, and still impose higher cubic and quartic constraints, in
order to obtain candidates for quarter-bps amplitudes, but we will not pursue this line
here. assuming this constraint is fullled, we therefore get an insertion q[r  r]/4t in
the integral, where q[s] is the casimir (t i)2 in the representation s. the other term with
two derivatives acting in the exponential gives a contribution q[r  r]/4t2, where q[s]
denotes the operator t it i acting on the symmetric tensor product sss. by developing
the square in (t i  1 + 1  t i)2, we nd that q[s s s] = 2q[s] + 2 q[s], so that all in all

emtm m/temtm m/t =

q[r4]  2q[r2]

8t2

(mtmm)2 

q[r2]

4t

mtmm

(2.9)

we now use the expression for the casimir of the p-th symmetric power of a representation
of highest weight ,

q[rp

 ] = (p, p + 2)

(2.10)

where  is the weyl vector, i.e. the sum of all the fundamental weights, and (,) the inner
product on the weight space with the length of the roots normalized to 2 (since we restrict
to simply laced lie groups of ade type). using formula (b.2) to integrate by part in (2.8),
we thus nd

proposition 1 the constrained eisenstein series (1.6) associated to the representation of
highest weight  is an eigenmode of the laplacian with eigenvalue

k\g e g(z)

r ;s = s(,   s) e g(z)

r ;s

(2.11)

9

this result reproduces the eigenvalue (2.5a) for the fundamental representation of sl(d, z)
but will be applied for many other situations in the following.
it implies in particular
that eisenstein series associated to representations related by outer automorphisms, i.e.
symmetries of the dynkin diagram, are degenerate under k\g, as well as two eisenstein
series of same representation but order s and [(, )/(, )]s. we also note that (2.11) can
be obtained more quickly by noting that m2s = (mtmm)s transforms as the symmetric
power of order 2s of r, and substituting p = 2s in (2.10). finally, we note that
eisenstein series are in fact eigenmodes of the complete algebra of invariant dierential
operators [28].

in some cases, it may happen that the constraint m  m = 0 can be solved in terms of
a lower dimensional representation. this is for instance the case of p-th symmetric tensors
of sl(d, r), where the constraint implies that the integers mijkl... themselves are, up to an
integer r, the symmetric power of a fundamental representation ni:

mijkl... = r ninjnknl . . . .

(2.12)

the summation over r can then be carried out explicitly, and the result is proportional
to the eisenstein function in the fundamental representation, with a redened order s 
ps. this, however, does not happen for antisymmetric tensors. since the antisymmetric
representations are associated to the nodes of the dynkin diagram, we are therefore led to
the conjecture that a generating set of eigenmodes of the laplacian is in general provided by
the eisenstein series associated to the nodes of the dynkin diagram, up to cusp forms; this
does not preclude identications such as (2.7), relating eisenstein series for representations
related by outer automorphisms.

2.4 decompactication and analyticity

our denition of eisenstein series has so far remained rather formal: the innite sums
appearing in (2.3), (2.6) are absolutely convergent for s > d/2 only, and need to be analyti-
cally continued for other values of s in the complex plane2. it turns out that the analyticity
properties can be determined by induction on d, which corresponds to the physical process
of decompactication. we thus assume the torus t d+1 to factorize into a circle of radius r
times a torus t d with metric gab and use the integral representation (2.8) of the eisenstein
series, say in the fundamental representation,

using the asymptotic behaviour of the bessel function (c.3), we see that the last term is
exponentially suppressed of order o(er), and the sum is absolutely convergent and thus
analytic in s. for d = 1, the sl(d, z) eisenstein series reduces to 2(2s)r2s and has a
simple pole at s = 1/2. for d > 1, induction shows that the pole at s = d/2 from the second
term cancels the one in the sl(d, z) eisenstein series, leaving the pole at s = (d + 1)/2
from the zeta function in (2.15). we thus have

proposition 2 the sl(d, z) eisenstein series of order s in the fundamental representation
can be analytically continued to the s-plane with s = d/2 excluded, where it has a single
pole with residue

(2.16)

this result is well known in the mathematical literature [27]. of course, the same holds for
the antifundamental representation by replacing vd by its inverse. let us mention in passing
that, together with the functional relation (2.7), this implies a relation which generalizes
2(0) = 1:

d;s=0 = e sl(d,z)
e sl(d,z)

d;s=0 = 1

(2.17)

we also note that the pole at s = d/2 coincides with the vanishing of the eigenvalue of
the eisenstein series under the laplacian sl(d). this is so because the residue is moduli
independent. an invariant modular form can still be obtained by subtracting the pole, in
which case the eigenmode equation gets a harmonic anomaly:

sl(d) e sl(d,z)

d;s=d/2 =

d/2(d  1)
2(d/2)vd

(2.18)

the case d = 2 will be particularly relevant in the sequel:

where ( ) denotes the usual dedekind function.

e sl(2,z)
2;s=1 =  log(cid:0)2|( )|4(cid:1)

(2.19)

this computation can unfortunately not be made for constrained eisenstein series,
since the constraint prevents a simple poisson resummation. we shall come back to this
problem in the next section for the so(d, d, z) case. we can however conjecture the
analytic structure from a simple argument: the divergences arise from the large m region,
where the integers can be approximated by n = dimr continuous variables. the nc
quadratic constraints restrict the phase space to rn nc, while inserting an extra factor
rnc in spherical coordinates, from (r2) = (r)/2r. we are therefore led to the integral

r rncrn nc1r2sdr, which converges for s > (n  2nc)/2. we therefore expect a simple
pole at s = (n  2nc)/2 for an eisenstein series of an n-dimensional representation with
nc independent constraints.

2.5 partial iwasawa decomposition

in determining the decompactication behaviour, we assumed the torus t d+1 to factorize
into t d  s1. this may be too restrictive, as for instance in m-theory applications, where
we are interested in the perturbative type ii limit corresponding to a vanishingly small
circle of radius rs = gsls but still want to retain the eect of the o-diagonal metric, i.e.
the ramond one-form a. it is then convenient to take the kaluzaklein ansatz

dxigijdxj = r2(dx1 + aadxa)2 + dxagabdxb

(2.20)

which is nothing but a partial iwasawa decomposition. this breaks the higher dimensional
symmetry sl(d + 1, r) to a subgroup sl(d, r), together with a nilpotent group of constant
shifts aa  aa + a, which is what remains from the kaluzaklein gauge invariance on a
at torus. in terms of these variables, the laplacian takes the form (see appendix a.5 for
details on the derivation.)

3 so(d, d, z) eisenstein series and one-loop thresholds

in this section we turn to the construction of eisenstein series for so(d, d, z) and its
application to one-loop thresholds in type ii string theory. higher genus contributions are
also amenable to an eisenstein series representation, and will be addressed in section 5.

3.1 moduli space and iwasawa gauge

owing to the occurrence of winding states charged under the 2-form b, any closed string
theory on a torus t d exhibits a larger symmetry o(d, d, z), a discrete subgroup of the
o(d, d, r) symmetry of the massless degrees of freedom. the symmetry is actually reduced
to so(d, d, z) in type ii theories, where the elements in o(d, d, z) with determinant 1
map type iia to type iib. this t-duality is valid to all orders in perturbation theory,
and postulated to hold non-perturbatively as well. it contains the mapping class group
sl(d, z) of the torus as a subgroup, as well as generators that are non-perturbative from a
world-sheet point of view. the moduli space includes a symmetric subspace

[so(d, r)  so(d, r)]\so(d, d, r)/so(d, d, z)

(3.1)

describing the metric of the torus and the two-form background, which can again be
parametrized using the iwasawa decomposition

so(d, d, r) = [so(d, r)  so(d, r)]  (r+)d  n so
2d ,

(3.2)

more precisely, the abelian part (r+)d corresponds to the d radii (and d inverse radii)
of the torus and the nilpotent part n so
i of the kaluza
klein gauge eld and the antisymmetric tensor bij. in particular, in the basis where the
so(d, d, z) invariant tensor is  =

by left so(d, r) so(d, r) gauge transformations. the sl(d, r) subgroup corresponds to

(3.4)

which provides the mass matrix for bps states in the vector representation v of so(d, d),
namely momentum and winding states. d-branes on the other hand transform as (conju-
gate) spinor representations s (c), and their mass matrix is given accordingly by r(e)tr(e)
where r(e) is the spinor or conjugate spinor representation of the group element e. we
can therefore build so(d, d, z) invariant functions by summing the bps mass or tension
over all bps states, which we do now.

3.2 spinor and vector eisenstein series

in order to dene these t-duality invariant functions, we need to be more explicit about the
mass matrix and bps conditions of these states. these have been reviewed in [5] (see [32]
for a resume) so we shall be brief in recalling them. the mass in the vector representation
in terms of the kk momenta and winding numbers mi, mi (i = 1 . . . d), reads

m2(v) = m  ete  m = migij mj + migijmj ,

k = mimi = 0 ,

(3.5a)

(3.5b)

where the last equation records the (quadratic) half-bps condition m  m = k = 0.
integer shifts of b  b + b induce a spectral ow mi  mi  bijnj on the lattice of bps
states, leaving the dressed charge mi = mi + bijmj invariant and preserving the condition
mm = 0. for the spinor representation with 2d1 charges (m[1], m[3], m[5], . . . )3 describing
the wrapping numbers along the odd cycles of t d, the charges can be encapsulated in a
dierential form m = midxi + 1
3! mijkdxi  dxj  dxk + . . . and the eect of the b-eld is to
2bijdxi  dxj(cid:1) m, where  denotes the inner product. the

3integer subscripts or superscripts in square brakets denote the number of antisymmetric sl(d) indices.
when separated by a semi-colon as in (3.7), they stand for groups of antisymmetric indices with no mutual
symmetry property. the upper or lower position of the indices denotes a gradient or contragradient
representation of sl(d).

the mass of type iib d-branes wrapped on an odd-dimensional cycle, or the tension of type

up to d = 6 only. in particular, we note that the rst occurrence of the quadratic constraints
is for d = 4, in which case they reduce to a singlet. for d = 5 they form a vector 5,
while for d = 6 they transform in an antisymmetric representation 66 of the t-duality
group so(6, 6, z). more generally, one should require the representation r s r to be
irreducible. similarly, for the conjugate spinor representation with wrapping numbers m =
(m, m[2], m[4], . . . ) around the even cycles of t d, we have

resentations. here (m  m) stands for the quadratic constraints (3.5b), (3.7), (3.9), and
m2(r) are the mass formulae given in (3.5a), (3.6), (3.8). not surprisingly, an explicit
computation (see appendix b) shows that these eisenstein series are indeed eigenmodes of
the laplacian on the scalar manifold (3.1),

in agreement with eq. (2.11). the degeneracy of the spinor and conjugate spinor (as well
as the vector for d = 4) is a consequence of the outer automorphism which relates the two
(or the three for d = 4, due to triality). we emphasize that the derivation shows that the
quadratic 1/2 bps constraints are essential for these eisenstein series to be eigenmodes.
for instance, in the case of the vector representation, the analogue of (2.9) is

t2

mtm(v)m

so(d,d)emtm (v)m/t =(cid:20)(mtm(v)m)2  4(m  m)2
where m m = mimi vanishes on half-bps states only. for low dimensional cases however,
the constraints drop or can be solved, so that we are back to ordinary eisenstein series.

3.3 one-loop modular integral and method of orbits

under toroidal compactication on a torus t d, any string theory exhibits the t-duality
symmetry so(d, d, z), and all amplitudes should be expressible in terms of modular forms
of this group. for half-bps saturated couplings, the one-loop amplitude often reduces to
an integral of a lattice partition function over the fundamental domain f of the moduli
space of genus-1 riemann surfaces,

id = 2zf

d2
 2
2

zd,d(g, b;  )

(3.16)

where zd,d is the partition function (or theta function) of the even self-dual lattice describing
the toroidal compactication,

zd,d = vd xmi,ni

e 

2

(mi+ ni)(gij +bij )(mj + nj) = (2)d/2 xmi,ni

e2m2(v)2i1mm

(3.17a)

this is for instance the case for r4 couplings in type ii strings on t d, or r2 or f 2 couplings
in type ii on k3  t 2. in the above formula, a poisson resummation on the integers mi
takes from the lagrangian representation, manifestly invariant under the genus 1 modular
group, to the hamiltonian representation, manifestly invariant under t-duality.

it is natural to expect a connection between this one-loop modular integral and the
so(d, d, z) eisenstein series dened above. as is well known, the  -integral can be carried
out by the method of orbits, which corresponds to a large volume expansion of the integral.
this was rst carried out in [33] and extended to higher dimensional tori in [10, 14]. we
will briey review these results for later comparison with the eisenstein series.

in order to carry out the integral on the fundamental domain of the upper half plane,
one uses the fact that an sl(2, z) modular transformation on  can be reabsorbed by an
sl(2, z) action on the doublet (mi, ni): one can thus restrict the sum over (mi, ni) to a sum
over their sl(2, z) orbits, while unfolding the integration to a larger domain depending on
the centralizer of the orbit. the orbits can be classied by dening the sub-determinants,
dij = minj  mjni, so that dij is a d  d antisymmetric matrix. we then have the trivial
orbit, mi = ni = 0, with a contribution

in this case we can set ni = 0, unfold the

the non-degenerate orbits, where at least one of the dij is non-zero. the sl(2, z) modular
action can be completely xed in order to unfold the integration domain to twice the
upper-half plane. after gaussian integration on  , we obtain:

i n.d
d = 4vd

xmi,ni

exph2p(m  g  m)(n  g  n)  (m  g  n)2 + 2ibijminji

p(m  g  m)(n  g  n)  (m  g  n)2

the summation is performed over all sets of 2n integers, having at least one non-zero dij,
modded out by the sl(2, z) modular action (for d = 1, this is m > 0, 0  n < m). these
terms are all exponentially suppressed at large vd, albeit not in a uniform way.

(3.20)

for low-dimensional cases, the sum can be further simplied, and yields the well-known

results:

i1 =

22

3 (cid:18)r +

1

r(cid:19) ,

i2 = 2 log(t2u2|(t )(u)|4)

(3.21)

it is remarkable that these results can be rewritten in terms of so(d, d, z) eisenstein series.
indeed, using the properties (3.15) and (2.19), we nd

proposition 3 for d = 1, 2, the one-loop integral id in (3.16) can be rewritten as the
sum of the so(d, d, z) eisenstein series of order 1 in the spinor and conjugate spinor
representations:

id = 2 e so(d,d,z)

s;s=1

+ 2 e so(d,d,z)

c;s=1

(3.22)

in particularly, the result is manifestly invariant under the extended t-duality o(d, d, z),
where the extra generator exchanges the two spinors. we shall now substantiate a similar
claim for d > 2, by showing that the two sides are eigenmodes of second order dierential
operators with the same eigenvalues, and that they also agree in various limits. at this
point, we note that the fact that the two spinor representations contribute is in agreement
with the invariance of the modular integral under the extended group o(d, d, z) which
exchanges the two spinors. besides, for d = 1 the vector eisenstein series  2
v;s=1/2 is
an equally valid candidate.

3 e so(1,1,z)

18

3.4 a new second order dierential operator

given that our eisenstein series are eigenmodes of the so(d, d) laplacian (3.11b), we
should ask about its action on the modular integral (3.16). an explicit computation of
the action of so(d,d) on the integrand shows that the lattice sum satises the dierential
equation

(cid:20)so(d,d)  2sl(2) +
1(cid:17) is the laplacian on the upper-half plane. upon integrating

where sl(2) = 1
by parts the second term, we get a boundary term which vanishes, so that the modular
integral itself is an eigenmode of so(d,d):

(3.25)

(3.26)

we expect the functions in (3.26) to be related to the ones in (3.25) by a duality transfor-
mation analogous to (2.7), although we cannot prove this statement at present due to the
presence of constraints.

less expected however is the existence of a second dierential operator (cid:3)d, involving

only the metric, which also annihilates the integrand up to a total derivative:

(cid:3)d = gl(d)

gij(cid:19)2

= sl(d) +

8d (cid:18)gij
2  d



gij(cid:19)2

(3.27)

where the gl(d) and sl(d) laplacians are given in (2.4b), (2.5b). indeed an explicit com-
putation shows that

(cid:20)(cid:3)d  sl(2) +

d(d  2)

8

(cid:21) zd,d = 0 ,

i.e. (cid:3)did =

d(2  d)

8

id.

(3.28)

the operator (cid:3)d is non-invariant under so(d, d), but is invariant under complete inversion
of the metric. 4

4in ref.[34] it was shown that the one-loop integral is an eigenfunction under a non-invariant second
2  + d(d2)
.

order operator  that involves both g and b. the relation with (cid:3)d in (3.27) is (cid:3)d = so  1
the equation (3.23) involving so was also given in ref. [14].

8

19

this last property gives a strong constraint for the identication of the modular inte-
gral id with eisenstein series. indeed, one can show that the spinor eisenstein series are
eigenmodes of (cid:3)d for s = 1 only, whereas the vector is always an eigenmode:

s(s  d + 1)

=

2

8

(3.29a)

(3.29b)

(3.29c)

in particular, we see that the spinor eisenstein series of order s = 1 and s = d  2 are
distinct, even though they are degenerate under so(d,d). a peculiarity occurs for d = 4,
where the spinor eisenstein series is an eigenmode for all s, whereas the conjugate spinor
is an eigenmode for s = 1 only:

(cid:3)4(v, s) = (cid:3)4(s, s) =

s(s  3)

2

,

(cid:3)4(c, s = 1) = 1

(3.30)

the three so(4, 4, z) eisenstein series at s = 1 are therefore degenerate under both so
and (cid:3)4, and we conjecture that they are actually equated by triality. the degeneracy is
however lifted at s 6= 1.

summarizing the results in this section, we see that the only candidates for representing
the modular integral (3.16) are the order s = 1 spinor and conjugate spinor series, together
in order to sort out these
with the order s = d/2  1 vector series and their duals.
possibilities, we need to determine the behaviour of these invariant functions in various
limits.

3.5 large volume behaviour

the large volume limit of the modular integral id has already been obtained from the orbit
decomposition. the behaviour of the eisenstein series on the other hand can be obtained
by poisson resummation techniques similar to the ones described in section 2, with the
complication of the constraints. the actual computation is deferred to appendix c, and
we present only the results, specializing to the relevant value of s. in the case of the vector

here the sum runs over non-degenerate sl(2, z) orbits of (mi, ni). comparing with the

a complete matching and thus obtain the theorem

this provides a convenient representation of the one-loop integral id, manifestly invariant
under t-duality. the eisenstein series of order s = d/2 in the vector representation is
degenerate with the one above, but singular, so we ignore it here.

in the case of the eisenstein series of order 1 in the spinor representations, the determi-
nation of the asymptotic behaviour is complicated by the presence of the constraints, and
we have to content ourselves with the partial results

(3.34)

the second term in (3.33a) is correct for d  3, but we are not able to prove it explicitly
for d > 3, due to the presence of the constraints; there are also exponentially suppressed
corrections that we did not write. the second term in (3.33b) denotes the eisenstein
series of sl(d, z) in the antisymmetric representation, and appears only when d  2. for
the particular order s = 1/2, it is easy to check from (b.14) that this series has the same
eigenvalue as the eisenstein series of order 1 in the fundamental representation. for d = 2, 3
we have also explicitly checked the equality of the two eisenstein series, so that we are led
to assert

21

conjecture 5 for any d, the eisenstein series of sl(d, z) in the antisymmetric represen-
tation at the particular order s = 1/2 coincides with the eisenstein series of order 1 in the
fundamental representation:

e sl(d,z)
[2];s=1/2 =

1
 e sl(d,z)

d;s=1

(3.35)

assuming this is true, we can now formulate our second claim for the one-loop threshold:

conjecture 6 the integral (3.16) of the (d, d) lattice partition function on the fundamen-
tal domain of the moduli space of genus 1 riemann surfaces is given for d  3 by the
so(d, d, z) eisenstein series of order s = 1 in any of the two spinor representations:

id = 2 e so(d,d,z)

s;s=1

= 2 e so(d,d,z)

c;s=1

(3.36)

this is to be contrasted with the d = 1, 2 case (3.22), where the two spinors contribute in
order to enforce the o(d, d, z) invariance of the integral (3.16). when d > 2, we conjecture
that the two eisenstein series are equal for the particular order s = 1, so that a single series
is sucient to reproduce the threshold. for d = 3, this conjecture is actually a theorem,
as follows from the computation of r4 couplings in 7 dimensions [10]. for d = 4, the
conjecture (3.36) together with the theorem (3.32) implies that the one-loop integral (3.16)
is invariant under so(4, 4) triality, a fact not obvious from its representation as a theta
function.

3.6 asymmetric thresholds and elliptic genus

so far, we focused on symmetric thresholds of the type (3.16), which often appear for half-
bps saturated couplings in type ii strings, and showed how they could be expressed in
terms of eisenstein series of the so(d, d, z) duality group. for heterotic strings however,
the bps condition constrains only the left-movers to be in their ground states, and the
amplitude usually involves all excitations of the right-moving oscillators. here we want to
investigate the possible relevance of eisenstein series for these quantities. even though the
negative outcome can already be anticipated due to the issue of symmetry enhancement,
this will allow us to establish some identities that may become useful in later studies.

one-loop bps-saturated couplings for toroidal compactications of the heterotic string

can usually be written as the modular integral

i het =zf

d2
 2
2

zd,d(g, b;  ) a(f, r,  )

(3.37)

22

where the insertion a is an almost holomorphic modular form of weight 0, depending on
the background gauge-eld f and curvature r in the uncompact dimensions. by almost
holomorphic, we mean that a can be expanded as a nite polynomial in 1/2

a(f, r,  ) =

max

x=0

1
2 a()(f, r,  )
 

(3.38)

with a()(f, r,  ) a meromorphic function in q = e2i . the non-holomorphic contributions
  1 come from back-reaction eects, or equivalently from contact terms at the boundary
of moduli space. in all string applications, the coecients a() have laurent expansions
with at most a simple pole in q, arising from the left-moving tachyon.

when the elliptic genus does not depend on the gauge elds, it is actually possible to

switch on wilson lines y , giving an so(d, d + k, z)-invariant threshold

where

and ak is now an almost holomorphic modular form of weight k/2. we can derive, also in
this case, a set of second order partial dierential equations satised by the lattice partition
function zd,d+k. it is convenient to choose the following iwasawa gauge, in the basis where

3.7 boundary term and symmetry enhancement

(3.47a)

(3.47b)

a quick glance at the partial dierential equations (3.46) may lead us to the conclusion
that the so(d, d + k)-invariant one-loop integral (3.39) should again be an eigenmode of
the operators so(d,d+k) and (cid:3)d,k. this is wrong however, due to the presence in a of the
tachyonic pole in 1/q. this pole is usually killed by the integration on the strip 1  [1, 1]
(at large 2), except at special points of the moduli space where the lattice contains a
length 2 vector: the contribution q1 q0 from the lattice sum cancels the pole, which signals

24

an enhancement of the gauge symmetry in space-time. in particular, using the identity
(3.46) requires particular care for the boundary term

(3.48)

the contribution from the constant term in a and the ground state of zd,d+k/(2)d/2 yields
a moduli-independent divergent (for d/2    1 > 0) term which implies a harmless
non-harmonicity, whereas the pole term in a generates a harmonic anomaly localized at
enhanced symmetry points in the moduli space, clearly not captured by any candidate
eisenstein series. finally, the term integrated by parts now involves the descendant of the
elliptic genus, as explained in [14]. for d = 2, the answer to this problem is well known: the
threshold involves the automorphic form of so(2, 2 + k) constructed by borcherds [35, 36]
(see also [37, 14] in the physics literature). the evaluation of the modular integral (3.39) by
the method of orbits gives a presentation of this form as an innite product over a sublattice,
and each term vanishes on a particular divisor of [so(2)  so(k)]\so(2, 2 + k) where the
it would be interesting to construct the generalization of
gauge symmetry is enhanced.
these objects to d > 2, where the complex structure is not present (and nd the analogue
of the generalized prepotentials obtained in ref.[14]) but we will not pursue this line here.

4 u-duality and non-perturbative r4 thresholds

while eisenstein series provide a nice way to rewrite one-loop integrals such as (3.16), their
utility becomes even more apparent when trying to extend the perturbative computation
into a non-perturbatively exact result. indeed, a prospective exact threshold should reduce
in a weak coupling expansion to a sum of t-duality invariant eisenstein-like perturbative
terms, plus exponentially suppressed contributions, and eisenstein series of the larger non-
perturbative duality symmetry are natural candidates in that respect. this approach was
taken in [10] for r4 couplings in type ii theories toroidally compactied to 7, 8, 9 dimensions,
where the technology of so(d, d, z) eisenstein series was hardly needed; here we would
like to extend it to lower dimensional compactications, in an attempt to understand non-
perturbative eects in these cases as well.

4.1 r4 couplings and non-renormalization

four graviton r4 couplings in maximally supersymmetric theories have been argued in
dimension d  8 to receive no perturbative corrections beyond the tree-level and one-loop

25

terms, and we shall assume that this holds in lower dimensions as well. the tree level term
is simply obtained by dimensional reduction of the ten-dimensional 2(3)e2 term found
in [38], while the one-loop term was explicitly shown to be given by the modular integral
(3.16), after cancellation of the bosonic and fermionic oscillators, so that

fr4 = 2(3)

vd

s

+ id + non pert.

(4.1)

while the ramond scalars are decoupled from the perturbative expansion by peccei-quinn
symmetries, the full non-perturbative result should depend on all the scalars in the sym-
metric space k\ed+1(d+1)(r), where ed+1(d+1)(r) is the maximally non-compact real form
(also known as the normal real form) of the series of classical simply laced lie groups
e2 = sl(2), e3 = sl(3)  sl(2), e4 = sl(5), e5 = so(5, 5) and exceptional lie groups
e6, e7, e8 [39, 40].
it should furthermore be invariant under the discrete symmetry
group ed+1(d+1)(z) also known as the u-duality group [41], which arises from the t-duality
so(d, d, z) by adjoining the exchange of the eleventh m-theory direction with any per-
turbative direction. the moduli space k\ed+1(d+1)(r) has the structure of a bundle on
the manifold [so(d) so(d)]\so(d, d, r) on which the neveu-schwarz scalars , g, b live,
with a bre transforming as a spinor representation of so(d, d, r) in which the ramond
scalars live. for d  8, it was shown [6, 8] that the exact threshold is an eigenmode of the
laplacian on the full scalar manifold as a consequence of supersymmetry, and we shall also
assume that this persists in lower dimensions.

as shown in conjecture 1, the one-loop contribution can be written as the order s = 1
so(d, d, z) eisenstein series in the spinor representation. on the other hand, the tree-level
term can itself be represented as an eisenstein series in the singlet representation, using
the property

e g(z)

4.2 string multiplet and non-perturbative r4 couplings

in order to propose a non-perturbative extension of this result, we therefore need to unify
the singlet and spinor representations of so(d, d, z) into a representation of ed+1(d+1)(z).

[43] for the d  4 case and
supplemented with an extra k1;8 form in d = 3. see ref.
[44, 5] for the general d case. this amounts to an explicit partial iwasawa decomposi-
tion of the symmetric spaces k\ed+1(d+1)(r). the corresponding state preserves half the
supersymmetries provided the following conditions are obeyed [43, 5]:

k[5] = m1m[4] = 0

k[2;6] = m1m[1;6] + m[4]m[4] = 0

k[5;6] = m[4]m[1;6] = 0

(4.7c)

the above constraints in turn transform as a u-duality multiplet, namely the three-brane
multiplet [5]. for completeness, table 4.1 lists the u-duality groups and string multiplets
for any d  6.

the decomposition of this ed+1(d+1)(z) irreducible representation into so(d, d, z) rep-
resentations was carried out in [44, 5], and indeed gives a singlet m = ms, a spinor
s = (mi, msijk, ms,sijklm), plus some other multiplets o when d  4.
in particular,
for d = 4, there is an extra singlet o = mijkl of so(4, 4, z), and for d = 5 a vector

where we set ls = 1 and m2(o) is the usual t-duality invariant mass for a singlet (d = 4)
or a vector (d = 5). given this group theory fact, it is therefore quite tempting to consider
the following non-perturbative generalization of (4.1):

conjecture 7 the exact four-graviton r4 coupling in toroidal compactications of type
ii theory on t d, or equivalently m-theory on t d+1, is given, up to a factor of newtons
constant, by the eisenstein series of the u-duality group ed+1(d+1)(z) in the string multiplet
representation, with order s = 3/2:

here lm is the eleven-dimensional planck length, vd+1 = rsvd the volume of the m-theory
torus t d+1. the quantity vd+1/l9
is the u-duality invariant gravitational constant
in dimension d = 10 d. as an immediate check, the proposal has the appropriate scaling
dimension d + 1  9 + 3  2 for an r4 coupling in dimension d = 10  d.

4.3 strings, particles and membranes

before showing how this conjecture reproduces the tree-level and one-loop terms, a few
remarks are in order. firstly, our claim reduces to the green-gutperle conjecture (1.1) in

28

the d = 1 case of m-theory on t 2, or equivalently d=10 type iib; it also contains the d =
7, 8 extension of [10] where the string multiplet transforms as a (3, 1) and 5 of sl(3, z) 
sl(2, z) and sl(5, z) respectively, as well as the d = 6 proposal in [10], although in a
rened way, since it is now a constrained eisenstein series that is involved. this is needed
to obtain an eigenmode of the laplacian on the scalar manifold k\ed+1(d+1)(r). although
such a requirement was strictly proved in d  8 [6, 8], it should very plausibly hold in
lower dimensions. using the general formula (2.11), we can compute the eigenvalue of the
ed+1(d+1)(z) eisenstein series in the string, particle and membrane representations. these
representations correspond to the leftmost, rightmost and upmost nodes in the dynkin
diagram (4.4) and can be labelled by sl(d + 1) charges as follows: the charges of the
string multiplet are given in (4.5) while the particle and membrane multiplet have charges
m[1], m[2], m[5], m[1;7] . . . and m, m[3], m[1;5] . . . respectively and are listed in tables 4.2 and
4.3. using the weights given in [5] we can compute the eigenvalues under the laplacian:

factor vd+1/l9

is inert under the laplacian, we obtain

corollary 8 r4 couplings in m-theory compactied on a torus t d+1 are eigenmodes of the
laplacian on the symmetric space k\ed+1(d+1)(r), with eigenvalue

(4.11)

this property could in principle be proved from supersymmetry arguments along the lines
of [6, 8], and holds order by order in the the weak coupling expansion. in particular, the tree
level contribution vd/(g2
p , albeit not u-duality invariant, is an eigenmode of
ed+1(d+1) with the same eigenvalue as above, see appendix a.4, eq. (a.24).

secondly, we assumed according to conjecture 1 that the eisenstein series in the spinor

need also the conjugate spinor. however, the two contribute to two dierent kinematic

is given at one-loop only by the so(d, d, z) eisenstein series of order s = 1 in the conjugate
spinor representation, and is u-duality invariant by itself.

thirdly, we could have considered the representation (3.32) of the one-loop threshold
in terms of the eisenstein series of order d/2  1 in the vector of so(d, d, z); the latter
appears as the leading term in the branching of the particle multiplet of ed+1(d+1)(z) into
representations of so(d, d, z) (see table 4.2), so we would be led to the ed+1(d+1)(z)
eisenstein series of order d/2  1 in the particle representation. upon weak coupling
expansion, this would start as a one-loop term e so(d,d,z)
v;s=d/21 as in (3.32), but would also
include another perturbative term after poisson resumming on the vector charges, which
would plausibly be the tree-level term in (4.1). similarly, we might have started from
the representation of the one-loop coupling in terms of the so(d, d, z) eisenstein series of
order 1 in the conjugate spinor representation; the latter arises as the leading term in the
branching of the membrane multiplet of ed+1(d+1)(z) into representations of so(d, d, z)
(see table 4.3), so we would be led to the ed+1(d+1)(z) eisenstein series of order 1 in the

30

membrane representation, yielding the correct one-loop term plus an extra (presumably
tree-level) perturbative contribution. indeed, it is easy to check that the eisenstein series

(4.12a)

are all degenerate with fr4 under the laplacian. it is thus quite tempting to conjecture

conjecture 9 the eisenstein series of ed+1(d+1)(z), d > 2, in the string multiplet rep-
resentation at the particular order s = 3/2 is equal to the one in the particle multiplet of
order s = d/21, and to the one in the membrane multiplet of order s = 1, up to numerical
coecients and powers of newtons constant:

(4.13)

again, it is easy to check that the scaling dimensions match. note that the restriction
d > 2 applies because we are making use of (3.36). for d = 3, 4, this conjecture nicely
checks with (2.7),(3.35),(3.36):

e sl(5,z)
5;s=3/2 =  e sl(5,z)
e so(5,5,z)
10;s=3/2 = e so(5,5,z)

10;s=1/2 = e sl(5,z)
16;s=1 = e so(5,5,z)

16;s=1

(4.14a)

(4.14b)

up to factors of newtons constant, whereas d > 4 gives new identities. the automorphic
forms in (4.13) should give three dierent representations of the same r4 threshold in
m-theory on t d+1.

4.4 weak coupling expansion and instanton eects

now, in order to justify the claim (4.9), we need to show that it reproduces the perturbative
contributions in (4.1) in a weak coupling expansion. this is achieved as usual by a sequence
of poisson resummations on the integral representation

fr4 =

m = ijklmijkl/4!. the leading contribution as gs  0 arises from the term mi = mi = m =
0 with m 6= 0, and reproduces the tree-level term in (4.1). after subtracting this term, the
sum over m is now unrestricted, and we can poisson resum on m using the formula (c.1):

where we should substitute s = 3/2. this now contains several contributions when m =

for m = 0, we precisely recover the
eisenstein series of order s  1/2 = 1 in the spinor representation, whereas m 6= 0 contains
non-perturbative e1/gs eects:

using the saddle point approximation (c.3) of the bessel function at s = 3/2, we see
that these non-perturbative terms can be interpreted as superposition of euclidean d0 and
d2-branes wrapped on a one-cycle mi or a three-cycle ijklml of t 4, preserving half of the
supersymmetries (mimi = 0) [30]. in addition to these terms, we have further contributions

which behave supercially as e1/g2

in toroidal compactications to d > 4, since there are no half-bps instanton congurations
with this action (the ns5-brane does have a tension scaling as 1/g2
s, but it can only give rise
to euclidean congurations with nite actions when d  4). unfortunately, the innite
sum is not uniformly convergent ( |m + n| can vanish at any rational value of ), so we
cannot be positive about the existence of such eects at that stage6. the matching of

the sum over m, but this only takes us back to (4.15).

the tree-level and one-loop contributions together with the consistent interpretation of the
d-brane contribution is however a strong support to our conjecture.

5 higher genus integrals and higher derivative couplings

5.1 genus g modular integral

having discussed the modular integrals arising in one-loop amplitudes, one may ask if our
methods carry over to higher-loop amplitudes, which are notoriously dicult to evaluate.
we shall not attempt to make any full-edged higher-genus amplitude computation, but we
will consider the higher-genus analogue of (3.16), namely the integral of a lattice partition
function on the 3g  3-dimensional moduli space of genus g curves

here, the integers mi
a, nia denote the winding numbers along the cycles a and a of a
symplectic basis of the homology lattice of the genus g curve, and the period matrix ab,
of positive denite imaginary part, describes the complex structure on the curve. (mi
a, nia)
transforms as a symplectic vector under sp(g, z) which now plays the role of the modular
group.  is the modular invariant weil-peterson measure on the moduli space mg of genus
g curves (see for instance [45] for a review). except for g = 1, 2, ab is a redundant
parametrization of the teichmuller space of dimension (3g  3), constrained by schottky
relations. nonetheless, for our computation it will be convenient to consider it as a set of
independent parameters living in the symmetric space u(g)\sp(g, r), with partial iwasawa
decomposition

m(v) = ig

1

ig!   1

2

2!  ig

1

ig!

(5.2)

note that the boost parameter 1 is now symmetric, as imposed by the symplectic condition.
from this it is straightforward (see appendix a for the derivation) to determine an sp(g, r)
invariant second order dierential operator, namely the laplacian on this manifold:7

sp(g) =

2cd(cid:19)

(5.3)

7again, the derivatives w.r.t.

to the symmetric matrices 1 and 2 are computed in terms of the

diagonally rescaled matrices (1  ab/2)1,2;ab.

33

which reduces to half the sl(2, r) laplacian (1.3) for g = 1. an explicit computation along
the same lines as before shows that the genus g lattice sum continues to obey a partial
dierential equation

(cid:20)so(d,d)  sp(g) +

dg(d  g  1)

4

(cid:21) z g

d,d = 0

(5.4)

the non-trivial step is now to integrate by parts the sp(g) term. as we already emphasized,
except in the g = 1, 2 case, the integration measure is not the sp(g, r)-invariant measure
on  -space, but its restriction to the solution of schottky constraints. nevertheless, we
assume that the expression of sp(g) in terms of the independent coordinates still yields
the appropriate laplacian, and we can therefore integrate it by parts. under this plausible
assumption, we obtain

so(d,d)i g

d =

dg(g + 1  d)

4

i g
d

(5.5)

quite amazingly, comparison with (3.12) shows that this eigenvalue agrees with the order
s = g eisenstein series in the spinor and conjugate spinor representation. we are therefore
led to the

conjecture 10 the integral (5.1) of the (d, d) lattice partition function on the fundamen-
tal domain of the moduli space of genus g riemann surfaces is given, up to an overall
factor, by the so(d, d, z) eisenstein series of order g in the spinor representation:

d  e so(d,d,z)
i g

s;s=g

+ e so(d,d,z)

c;s=g

(5.6)

note that the superposition of the two spinor representations is required by the o(d, d, z)
invariance of the integrand. normalizing (5.6) would require a knowledge of the weil-
peterson volume of the moduli space of genus g curves.

5.2 n = 4 topological string and higher derivative terms

the conjecture (5.6) is less substantiated than the 1-loop conjecture (3.36), since we do
not have a second dierential operator at our disposal, nor can we control the large volume
limit of the lefthand side of (5.6). it is however strongly reminiscent of the genus g partition
function of the n = 4 topological string [46] on t 2, which was shown to be exactly given
by the eisenstein series of order s = g in the spinor representation e sl(2,z)
2;s=g (t ) [47]. the

involves a set of harmonic variables u, with charge 1/2 under the r-symmetry so(2). this
result was obtained from a set of rst-order dierential equations, which, loosely speaking,
are nothing but the holomorphic half of our second-order dierential equation (5.5). it was
subsequently used to derive a set of higher derivative topological couplings r4h 4g4 in type
iib string compactied over t 2 [48]. our conjecture (5.6) suggests a natural generalization
of these results to lower dimensions, which we shall now present.

the topological amplitude (5.7) can be identied with higher derivative couplings
r4h 4g4 in type iib string theory on t 2 in the following way. the eld-strength of
the ramond two-forms b ,d12 transform as a doublet h i
rr of sl(2, r)t . using the
so(2)\sl(2, r) two-bein e
, these two three-forms can be converted into an so(2) dou-
blet h

, and further contracted with the harmonic variables into an so(2)

where m(c) is the mass matrix in the conjugate spinor representation c of so(2, 2, z).
indeed, h i transforms as a conjugate spinor under the t-duality group, while mi = (m, n)
transforms in the dual way. more generally, in type iib on t d the 2-form and 1-form
potentials in the rr sector transform in the conjugate spinor and spinor representation of
so(d, d) respectively, while in type iia these two representations are interchanged.

using the representation (5.9), the generalization of the g-loop r4h 4g4 coupling to

lower dimensions is then obvious: in type iia variables,

conjecture 11 the r4h 4g4 couplings between 4 gravitons and 4g4 ramond three-form
eld-strengths in type iia compactied on t d, d  4 are given at genus g by the so(d, d, z)

parameters, and generalizes the usual t8t8 + 88/4 combination [48].

where  is the t-duality invariant dilaton, related to the ten-dimensional coupling as e2 =
vd/g2
s ld
s , and we work in units of ls. the restriction d  4 is due to the fact that for d = 5
three-form eld-strengths are poincare dual to two-form eld-strengths, while for d = 4
they become part of the scalar manifold after dualization. a similar conjecture also holds
for the coupling computed by the topological b-model [46],

conjecture 12 the r4f 4g4 couplings between 4 gravitons and 4g  4 ramond two-form
eld-strengths in type iia compactied on t d, d  6 are given at genus g by the so(d, d, z)
constrained eisenstein series in the conjugate spinor representation with insertions of 4g4
charges:

i =z d10dx

xm

(m  m) e6(g1) r4 (m  frr)4g4
(m  m(c)  m)3g2

(5.11)

here, the restriction d  6 is due to the fact that for d = 3 two-forms eld-strengths
become part of the scalar manifold after poincare dualization. the relation between these
two conjectures and the genus g integral (5.6) is similar to the case of (t8t8  88/4)r4
couplings in dimensions 8 or higher: the insertions of the vertex operators of the four
gravitons and the 4g  4 two-forms frr or three-forms hrr saturate the fermionic zero-
modes and select one out of the two spinor contributions in the modular integral (5.6). the
end results (5.10) and (5.11) involve covariant modular functions instead of invariant ones,
but behave as eisenstein series of order 3g  2  (4g  4)/2 = g for most purposes. they
generalize the sl(2, z) modular functions f p,q = p (p+q)/2
/[(m + n )p(m + n )q] invariant
up to a phase, that were also used in the context of non-perturbative type iib string in
[49, 50].

5.3 non-perturbative r4h 4g4 couplings

having put the g-loop amplitude in a manifestly t-duality invariant form (5.10), it is
now straightforward to propose a non-perturbative completion, invariant under the full
u-duality group. for that purpose, we note that the set of three-form eld-strengths in
m-theory compactied on t d+1 fall into a representation of ed+1(d+1) dual to the string
multiplet which already appeared in section 4 (this is strictly speaking only correct for
d  5 as explained below (5.10)). the string multiplet decomposes under so(d, d, z) into
a singlet (the neveu-schwarz hn s) a spinor (the ramond three-forms obtained by reducing
the m-theory four-form eld-strength), as well as further terms for d  4. it is therefore
tempting to propose

36

conjecture 13 the r4h 4g4 couplings between 4 gravitons and 4g  4 three-form eld-
strengths in m-theory compactied on t d+1, d  4 are exactly given, up to a power of
newtons constant, by the ed+1(d+1)(z) constrained eisenstein series in the string represen-
tation with insertions of 4g  4 charges:

(5.12)

i =

as an immediate check, we note that this proposal has the appropriate scaling dimension.
the leading contribution arises by restricting the summation to ms 6= 0 only, where ms is
the top charge in the string multiplet m, contracted with the top three-form h n s:

i =

s l8

s z d10dx 2 (2g + 1) r4 h 4g4

n s + . . .

(5.13)

corresponding to a tree-level interaction involving the neveu-schwarz three-form only. the
next-to-leading contribution is obtained by poisson resummation on the integer ms, and
setting the dual integer to zero, as in our analysis of r4 couplings. this has the eect of
setting m  h = mrr  hrr (for vanishing value of the ramond scalars) and shifting the
order 3g  3/2  3g  2. we thus reproduce the g-loop result (5.10). the analysis of
non-perturbative eects is as in the r4 case, and shows order e1/gs d-brane eects as well
as, for d  4, contributions supercially of order e1/g2
s . more explicitly, in the simplest
example of ten-dimensional type iib theory, we obtain, in units of the 10d planck length,

(5.14)

turning nally to the case of non-perturbative r4f 4g4 couplings, we note that the
two-form eld-strengths of m-theory compactied on t d+1 transform as the dual of the
particle multiplet. the particle multiplet is the representation associated to the rightmost
node in the dynkin diagram (4.4) (see ref. [5] for further details). it is thus quite natural
to propose a non-perturbative completion as

(5.15)

where the power 4g  5 + d/2 has been set by dimensional analysis. the particle multiplet
decomposes as a vector and conjugate spinor of so(d, d, z) in that order, so that this

37

proposal implies a one-loop term given by the so(d, d, z) eisenstein series of order 2g3 +
d/2 in the vector representation, plus a higher perturbative term which should reproduce
the genus g term (5.11). due to the presence of constraints, we are unfortunately not
able to prove this statement at present. for g = 1, this conjecture is implied by the
alternative form of the r4 threshold in (4.13). note that this proposal may in principle
lift the diculty raised by berkovits and vafa, who noted that in 8 dimensions the non-
perturbative generalization of the genus g r4f 4g4 terms should include a mixing between
the u(1)\sl(2, r) and so(3)\sl(3, r) moduli [48]. here the mixing is built-in since the
particle multiplet transforms in the (3, 2) of sl(3, z)  sl(2, z). let us nally note that
our techniques could also be used to generalize the conjectures about 2kr4 and r3m+1
terms [51, 52], but the status of these is less clear.

6 conclusions

duality provides strong constraints on the non-perturbative extension of string theory. it
is especially powerful in vacua with many supersymmetries, where physical amplitudes and
low energy couplings have to be invariant under the symmetry group. for a restricted class
of bps saturated couplings, the supersymmetry constraints close into a set of partial dier-
ential equations, which together with perturbative boundary conditions allows to determine
the result exactly. such techniques have enabled us to obtain convenient representations
of one-loop thresholds manifestly invariant under t-duality, to compute higher-genus am-
plitudes not tractable otherwise, and to propose an exact non-perturbative completion of
r4h 4g4 couplings in toroidal compactications of m-theory. upon expansion in weak
coupling, these results reveal a tree-level and g-loop contribution, non-perturbative order
e1/gs eects that can be attributed to euclidean d-branes wrapped on various cycles of
the internal torus, as well as further ill-understood non-perturbative eects supercially
of order e1/g2
s , appearing in dimension d = 6 and lower. it would be very interesting to
ascertain the behaviour of these eects, and eventually give an instantonic interpretation
for them. in d = 4 we expect such e1/g2
s eects from the euclidean ns5-brane wrapped
on t 6 which should be extracted from our conjecture (4.9). finally, the generalization
to d  2 should involve eisenstein-like series for ane lie algebras and even hyperbolic
kac-moody algebras.

we have focused in this work on half-bps saturated couplings in maximally super-
symmetric theories.
it would be interesting to extend our techniques to (i) couplings
preserving a lesser amount of supersymmetry, and (ii) half bps states in theories with
less supersymmetry. given that the quadratic half-bps constraint imposes second order

38

dierential equations and that the quarter-bps condition is cubic in the charges, one may
envisage that quarter-bps saturated couplings should be eigenmodes of a cubic casimir
operator, and expressable as generalized eisenstein series. as for the second issue, one
has to face situations where the gauge symmetry can be enhanced at a particular point
in the moduli space, a case where eisenstein series seem to be of little relevance. the
dierential equations (3.46) and the generalized prepotentials of [14] should prove useful
for constructing automorphic forms with the required singularity structure, generalizing
[53, 37, 36, 54]. particularly interesting cases include the toroidal compactications of the
heterotic string, where ve-brane instantons are little understood; type iib compactied
on k3, where the moduli space unies the dilaton with the other scalars in a simple form
[so(5)  so(21)]\so(5, 21) and where tensionless strings appear at singularities of k3;
the fhsv model [29], where the duality group is broken to a subgroup of so(2, 10, z) by
the freely acting orbifold construction.

on a more mathematical level, our results provide a wealth of explicit examples of mod-
ular functions on symmetric spaces of non-compact type k\g, with g a real simply laced
lie group in the normal real form, that generalize the eisenstein series on the fundamental
domain of the upper half-plane. these functions can be associated to any fundamental
representation of g, and are eigenmodes of the laplacian with an easily computable eigen-
value. from analyzing their asymptotics and their behaviour under the laplace operator as
well as some other dierential operator, we have been able to obtain a number of relations
between eisenstein series in various representations, although we had to content ourselves
with conjectures rather than proofs in several cases. this has shown that eisenstein se-
ries may become equal for certain values of the order s, the most useful example being
the equality of the vector, spinor and conjugate spinor eisenstein series of so(d, d, z) at
s = d/2  1, s = 1 and s = 1 respectively. on the other hand, two eisenstein series with
the same eigenvalue under the laplacian may still be separated by an extra dierential op-
erator, like (cid:3)d in the so(d, d) case. we have not addressed the question of the analyticity
of eisenstein series with respect to the order s: this would require an asymptotic expansion
analogous to (1.4) or (2.15) with a uniformly suppressed general term. unfortunately, it
seems that the presence of constraints tends to give rise to ill-behaved expansions such as
(3.31). this problem is the mathematical counterpart of the physical one raised above,
namely understanding the instanton eects that are supercially of order e1/g2
s . it would
be interesting to understand more precisely what eisenstein series are needed to generate
the spectrum of the laplace operator for any eigenvalue (note in that respect that the
order s is no longer a good parametrization, since the relation between the eigenvalue and
s depends on the representation). from a mathematical point of view however, eisenstein

39

series are the least interesting part of the spectrum on such manifolds, which should also in-
clude a discrete series of cusp forms. perhaps string theory will provide an explicit example
of these elusive objects.

a.1 laplacian on the so(d)\gl(d, r) and so(d)\sl(d, r) symmetric spaces

for the so(d)\gl(d) case, we can choose m = g a symmetric positive denite matrix, and
the metric ds2 and volume element take the form

ds2 = gikgjldgijdgkl ,

det(ds2) = 2

(a.3)

and using the relation

= (2  ij)gij det g .

in order to avoid the cumbersome sums over ordered indices, it is convenient to introduce
the diagonally rescaled metric

this then satises the properties

where now repeated indices are summed over without further restrictions. this is the form
given in (2.4b), where we omitted the tilde on the redened metric as done throughout the
text of the paper for simplicity of notation.

to compute the laplacian on the so(d)\sl(d) symmetric space from this, we decompose

the element g of gl(d) as g = tg, with det g = 1. the metric then takes the form

ds2

gl = ds2

t (cid:19)2

so that the laplacian reads

together with (a.9), this yields the result (2.5b) for the sl(d) laplacian.

(a.10)

(a.11)

a.2 laplacian on the [so(d)  so(d)]\so(d, d, r) symmetric space

next, we turn to the laplacian on the symmetric space [so(d)  so(d)]\so(d, d) of
dimension d2. we can choose the symmetric moduli matrix m as in (3.4), so that the
metric in (a.1) reads

ds2 = gikgjl (dgijdgkl + dbijdbkl)

(a.12)

41

this is a bration on the coset so(d)\gl(d), so we only need to compute the laplacian on
the ber. we order the indices as

ds2

b = 2 xi<j;k<l(cid:0)gikgjl  gilgjk(cid:1) dbijdbkl

(a.13)

the determinant of the metric on the ber is b = 1/(det g)d1, up to an irrelevant numer-
ical factor. using (a.2), the volume form on the total manifold is therefore  = (det g)d.
the inverse metric reads

ds2

b,inv =

1

2 xi<j;k<l

(gikgjl  gilgjk) dbijdbkl

so that the laplacian on the ber is given by

(a.17)

which is the one given in (3.11b). the so(d, d + k) laplacian (3.44) can be computed
using similar techniques, but we will not give the details of this computation here.

a.3 laplacian on the u(g)\sp(g, r) symmetric space

next, we derive the laplacian on the u(g)\sp(g) symmetric space, relevant for the genus
g amplitude in (5.1). using for m the moduli matrix (5.2), the metric in (a.1) takes the
form

ds2 =  ac

2

 bd
2

(d1abd1cd + d2abd2cd) ,

(a.18)

this is again a bration on the coset so(g)\gl(g), so again we only need to compute the
laplacian on the ber. the determinant of the metric on the ber is |1 = 1/(det 2)g+1,

42

up to an (irrelevant) numerical factor, so that, using (a.2) the volume form on the total
manifold is  = (det 2)(g+1). with the known result (a.6) for the gl(d) laplacian, we
then obtain

sp(g) = xab;cd



2ab

2ac2bd



2cd

+ 2ac2bd xab;cd



1ab



1cd  (g + 1)xab

2ab



2ab

(a.19)

diagonally rescaling 1 and 2 as before gives the more compact and covariant expression

sp(g) =

2ac2bd(cid:18)

which is the form given in (5.3) and reduces to half the usual laplacian on the poincare
upper half-plane for g = 1.

a.4 laplacian on the k\ed+1(d+1)(r) symmetric space

we nally give here also the laplacian on the the scalar manifold k\ed+1(d+1)(r) of eleven-
dimensional supergravity on t d+1 (equivalently type iia string theory on t d). in this case,
the scalars are given by the metric gij , i = 1 . . . d + 1, a three-form cijk and its dual e6
(and for d = 11  (d + 1)  3 an extra k1,8-form, which will not be included below). for
d  6, the corresponding laplacian is given by

the eigenvalues (4.10) of the eisenstein series of the particle, string and membrane multiplet
can be checked explicitly from this form using the mass formulae of these multiplets and
the techniques employed in appendix b. to this end it is important to express the 11d
planck length lm , which is not invariant under the u-duality group ed+1(d+1)(z), in terms
of the invariant planck length lp using the relation vd+1/l9

m = ld8
p .

note also that, since for d  4 the u-duality groups ed+1(d+1)(z) are of the sl and
so type the laplacian above should reduce to the corresponding forms by appropriate

43

redenition of the scalars. for d = 5, 6, with u-duality group e6, e7 the above laplacian
is not contained in the previous results.

it is useful to determine the t-duality decomposition of the laplacian (a.21). for
that purpose, we compute the kinetic terms of the scalars in the kaluzaklein reduction
of ten-dimensional type iia theory. going to the einstein frame g  e4/(8d)g, where
e = gs/vd is the invariant dilaton, we nd

here, r denote the ramond scalars transforming in the spinor representation of so(d, d),
and the dots stand for extra scalars which originate from dualizing the kaluzaklein one-

xk=even

k(cid:19) = xk=odd
k(cid:18)d

k(cid:19) = d 2d2 ,
k(cid:18)d

(a.23)

it follows that the mass matrix m(s), like m(c), has unit determinant. the volume
element is thus given by  = e2d1 (for d < 5 and in fact also d = 5), and the laplacian
on the symmetric space k\ed+1(d+1)(r) then reads, in variables appropriate for t-duality,

(a.24)

ed+1(d+1) =

8  d
16 (cid:0)2

 + 2d1(cid:1) + so(d,d) +

from this we can for example check that the einstein-frame tree-level r4 term e12/(d8), or
the one-loop term e2(d2)/(d8) e so(d,d,z)
s,c;s=1 are eigenmodes of the u-duality invariant lapla-
cian as required by the conjecture (4.11).

a.5 decompactication of the laplacians

we conclude by giving the decompactication formulae for the gl(d) and so(d, d) lapla-
cians. these are relevant for the study of the decompactifcation properties of the corre-
sponding eisenstein series.

we will consider only the so(d, d) case, since the resulting formulae for gl(d) and sl(d)

can easily be obtained from this case. for the metric we take the u(1)-bered form

dxigij dxj = r2(dx1 + aadxa)2 + dxagabdxb

(a.25)

44

where a = 2, . . . d and the original metric is gij. we also dene

b1a = ba ,

bab = bab +

1
2

[aabb  abba]

(a.26)

in terms of these variables, t-duality takes the simple form

r 

1
r

,

e 

e
r

, aa  ba ,

(gab, bab) inv.

(a.27)

for the purpose of dimensional reduction it is, however, more convenient to introduce a
modied bab eld invariant under gauge transformations of aa (but not under shifts of ba):

bab = bab + aabb  baab

(a.28)

in the expressions below, we also use the diagonally rescaled metric (a.7) for g when-
ever it appears in derivatives. the jacobian for the change of variables from (gij, bij) to
(r, aa, gab, ba, bab) is given by

the jacobian relevant for the gl(d) laplacian is simply obtained by ignoring the terms
involving b. then, we nd for the gl(d) laplacian the decomposed result (2.21), while for

b eigenmodes and eigenvalues of the laplacians

in this appendix we give some details on the explicit computation of the eigenvalues under
the laplacian and the non-invariant dierential operator (3.27) of the various eisenstein
series and modular integral considered in the main text. these computations are most
easily done using the integral representation

(b.2)

b.1 sl(d, z) eisenstein series in the fundamental representation

we start with the fundamental representation of sl(d, z), for which the mass matrix reads
m2(d) = mtgm = migijmj, and obeys the identities

m2(d)

gij

= 2mimj ,

2m2(d)
gijgkl

= 0

(b.3)

so that using the laplacian (2.4b), we obtain

em2(d)/tgl(d)em2(d)/t =

t2 (cid:2)m2(d)(cid:3)2

2t m2(d)

(b.4)

then, using the identity (b.2) we immediately nd the eigenvalue s(s + 1  d+1
2 ) as given
in (2.4a). the corresponding eigenvalue under the sl(d) laplacian follows by subtracting
the (t/t)2/d contribution in (a.11),

(b.5)

so that the eigenvalue is s(s + 1  (d + 1)/2)  s2/d as given in (2.5a).

b.2 so(d, d, z) eisenstein series in the vector representation

for the case of the vector representation of so(d, d), the mass matrix now reads

m2(v) = mtm(v)m = migij mj + nigijnj ,

mi = mi + bijnj

(b.6)

46

and satises

m2(v)

gij

= 2(cid:2) mi mj + ninj(cid:3) ,

m2(v)

bij

= 2(cid:2) minj  mjni(cid:3)

where mi = gij mj. to compute the action of the laplacian (3.11b) and of the operator (cid:3)d
in (3.27) we need the quantities

b.3 so(d, d, z) eisenstein series in the spinor representations

the direct computation of the eigenvalues of the (conjugate) spinor eisenstein under the
so(d, d) laplacian is more involved and will not be given here. the general results in (3.12)

47

have been checked directly for d  4, showing also in this case explicitly the importance of
imposing the half-bps constraints (3.7a) and (3.9a) that occur for d = 4.

finally, we turn to the action of the (cid:3)d operator on the (conjugate) spinor representation

(3.6), (3.8) of so(d, d), with mass

m2(s) =

1

vd xp=odd

( m[p])2

(b.11)

where m[p] = m[p] + b2m[p2] + b2
the invariant square obtained with p powers of the metric. we need the derivative

2m[p4] + . . . are the dressed charges and ( m[p])2 denotes

m2(s)

gij

=

1

vd xp

2p[( m[p])2]ij  ( m[p])2gij

p!

(b.12)

where [( m[p])2]ij denotes the invariant square with one power of the metric taken out. the
direct computation of the full (cid:3)d along the same lines as the cases treated above is rather
intricate. we therefore employ a method that uses the underlying group theory and the
realization that (cid:3)d contains the sl(d) laplacian, as well as the structural form (3.7) of the
constraints.

we rst note that each term in (b.11) represents a totally antisymmetric tensor of sl(d)
with p indices. for an antisymmetric p-tensor of sl(d), the casimir of the rth symmetric
power is given by

q([p]r) =

rp(d  p)(r + d)

d

so that according to the general formula (2.11) the action of the sl(d) laplacian is

sl(d)[(m[p])2]s =

p(d  p)s(2s  d)

2d

[(m[p])2]s ,

(b.13)

(b.14)

using the identity (b.2), we therefore have, up to cross terms which we neglect for the
moment,

em2(s)/tsl(d)em2(s)/t =

1

where we emphasize that this result is only valid when enforcing the quadratic constraints
on the charges. we also need

obtained by direct calculation using (b.12). using the form of (cid:3)d in (3.27) we obtain from
the two expressions in (b.15) and (b.16) that

using (b.2) we then deduce that

(cid:19) (m[p])2
requiring the righthand side to be proportional to (the diagonal terms in) (m2(s))2 then
shows us that (for generic value of d) this is only possibly when s = 1, in which case we
nd that

+m2(s)xp (cid:18)p(d  p) +

vd p! (cid:19)2
(cid:19)(cid:18)(m[p])2
d(d  2)

8

(cid:3)d(m2(s))s =

d(2  d)

8

(m2(s))s ,

s = 1

(b.19)

so that the s = 1 spinor and conjugate spinor eisenstein series are eigenmodes of (cid:3)d as
recorded in (3.29b), (3.29c).

a special feature arises for the spinor representation of so(4, 4), in which case we have
p(d  p) = p(4  p) = 3 for both the relevant values p = 1 and 3 so that the terms in
(b.18) are proportional to (m2(s))2 for all values of s. as a result we nd that the spinor
eisenstein series for so(4, 4) is an eigenmode of (cid:3)d with eigenvalue s(s  3)/2 as noted in
(3.30) 9. this is not the case for the conjugate spinor representation of so(4, 4).

finally, we wish to point out some further checks on the cross terms that have been
neglected so far. first, we have explicitly checked the full result by direct computation for
the spinor representation in the cases d  4. in particular, for d = 4 one nds, as expected
that the constraint m[1]  m[3] = 0 of (3.7a) is crucial for the eigenvalue condition. more
generally, using the metric on weight space g[p][q] = p(d  q)/d with [p]  [q] two totally
antisymmetric sl(d) representations, we know from the group theory arguments in (2.9)

9in a similar way one can see that the spinor and conjugate spinor eisenstein series of so(2, 2) are

eigenvalues for all s, but that was expected since in that case (cid:3)d reduces to the sl(2) laplacian.

49

that the cross terms in (b.15) can be incorporated by replacing the 1/t2 term by

1

t2 "xpq

(2  pq)

p(d  q)

d

vd q! (cid:19)#
vd p! (cid:19)(cid:18) (m[q])2
(cid:18)(m[p])2

(b.20)

together with the directly computed cross terms in (b.16), this changes the 1/t2 term in
(b.17) to

1

t2 xpq

(2  pq)(cid:18)d(p + q) + 2(p  q)  2pq

(cid:19)(cid:18)(m[p])2

vd p! (cid:19)(cid:18) (m[q])2
vd q! (cid:19)

(b.21)

which will produce an analogous correction to (b.18). for s = 1 we then see that, taking
into account the cross terms from the second term in (b.18), the (p, q)-dependent part is
given by

(d(p + q) + 2(p  q)  2pq)  (p(d  p) + q(d  q)) = (p  q)(p  q + 2)

(b.22)

which we see vanishes (besides the diagonal terms p = q) for the cross terms q  p = 2.

if q  p > 2, there are non-trivial eects from the constraints. a simple way to see
them is to consider the two-form in the d = 4 conjugate spinor. the 1/t2 contribution
to sl includes a term (m[2])4, where the contraction is the non-factorized one. by the
cayleyhamilton theorem for 4  4 antisymmetric matrices a,
(tra2)a2 + (pfaana)21 = 0

(b.23)

a4

2

we see that this is [(m[2])2]2/2 up to a (m[2]  m[2])2 term, which by the half-bps condition
(3.9a) is equivalent to an extra cross term (m m[4])2 that was not taken into account
previously and will cancel the decit seen in (b.22).

c large volume expansions of eisenstein series

here, we derive the results (3.31), (3.33) by considering the large volume expansions of
the vector, spinor and conjugate spinor eisenstein series of so(d, d). in the computations
below we shall repeatedly use the poisson resummation formula

c.1 so(d, d, z) vector eisenstein series

sentation of so(d, d), for which we use the integral representation

here the integration over  incorporates the constraint mini = 0 and the squares denote
the invariant contraction with the metric or inverse metric depending on the position of
the indices. we rst extract the ni = 0 piece, and in the remaining part poisson resum on
the integers mi which are now unconstrained. then e so(d,d,z)

here we have recognized the rst term (c.8) as the eisenstein series of the antifundamental
of sl(d) and used the identity (2.7) in the last step. continuing with the second term (c.9)
we note that although the integration over  runs from 0 to 1 only, we can reabsorb a shift
   + 1 into a spectral ow mi  mi + ni. we therefore extend the integration range
of  to n   but sum on mi modulo ni only. then, after performing the gaussian
integration on , the second term becomes

we now extract the terms for which (m  n)2  (m  m)(n  n) = 0. by schwarz inequality,
this is the case if and only if mi = ni for all i, and therefore the phase factor in (c.9) is
irrelevant. for a given vector n, the number of parallel vectors m modulo the spectral ow
is gcd({ni}), so that we have j2(v) = j2a(v) + j2b(v) with
nigijnj(cid:21)s d2
2 (s  d1
(s)(2s  d + 2)
is and greatest common divisor r, carried
here we have split the integers ni into coprime n
out the r-summation, and rewritten the coprime integers in terms of integers again at
the expense of yet another r summation. finally, for the remaining non-degenerate terms
j2b(v) in (c.9) we can perform the integral on t using (c.2) so that

where the sum runs over (non-degenerate) sl(2, z) orbits of vectors (m, n). our nal result
for the large volume expansion of the order s eisenstein series of the vector representation of
so(d, d) is thus obtained as the sum of expressions (c.8), (c.10) and (c.11). substituting
the particular value s = d

here, to simplify the second term (c.10) we have used (c.5b) and e sl(d,z)
d;s=0 = 1 (see
(2.16)). for the third term (c.11) we have used (c.4) to express the bessel function k1/2
as an exponential. we have thus reproduced the announced result (3.31).

c.2 so(3, 3, z) spinor and conjugate spinor eisenstein series

2 ijkbjk is the dual of the ns 2-form. we single out the contribution with n = 0 and
for the remaining terms we poisson resum on the (unconstrained) integer mi whose dual
charge is mi. the latter contribution splits up into a part with mi = 0 and a remaining
non-degenerate contribution, so that after some algebra we can write

where we have used the denition (2.3) of the sl(d) eisenstein series, (c.5b) and (c.4)
in each of the three terms respectively. the two leading terms establish the claim in
(3.33a), reproducing the trivial and degenerate orbit contribution of the 1-loop integral i3
respectively. moreover, exact agreement is also explicitly seen [10] between the third term
and the non-degenerate orbit contribution (3.20).

the remainder poisson resum on the unconstrained integer n, whereafter we distinguish
between n = 0 and the rest. after some algebra we then have

where we have also used the identity (2.7) to rewrite the second term in terms of the
fundamental representation of sl(d). setting s = 1 we nd exactly the same result (c.15)
as obtained for the spinor representation, with the rst two terms interchanged as noted in
(3.33b). the equality of the d = 3 spinor and conjugate series for s = 1 is obvious from the
fact that the two representations have inverse mass matrices in this case and (since there
are no constraints on the charges) can hence be related by a complete poisson resummation

= e so(3,3,z)
equivalently, this identity follows from (3.15c) and (2.7).

c.3 so(4, 4, z) spinor and conjugate spinor eisenstein series

moving on to so(4, 4) we remark that from this case on, one needs to incorporate the
non-trivial half-bps constraints (3.7) and (3.9). the integral representation of the spinor
eisenstein series reads

incorporated due to the  integration. the evaluation of this integral proceeds in a way

54

where all inner products are taken with the inverse metric.
in fact, this result can be
obtained immediately from the result of the so(4, 4) vector representation (substitute
d = 4 in (c.8) + (c.10) + (c.11)), using the triality relation

m2(s; g, b; mi, ni) = m2(v; v4g1, b; ni, mi)

(c.21)

between the so(4, 4) spinor and vector mass. for use below we also note that the rst two
terms can be expressed in terms of sl(4) eisenstein series,

e so(4,4,z)

(c.22)

evaluating this at s = 1 with the use of (c.5b) we reproduce the two leading terms (3.33a).
using (c.2) the non-degenerate contribution at s = 1 in (c.20) takes the form

2

xmi,ni

exp(cid:16)2v4p|(m  m)(n  n)  (m  n)2| + 2ibijminj(cid:17)

p|(m  m)(n  n)  (m  n)2|

(c.23)

although we have not been able to show it explicitly, this contribution should be equal
the corresponding non-degenerate contribution in (c.12) for the so(4, 4) vector eisenstein
series at s = 1, and hence equal to the non-degenerate contribution of the 1-loop integral
i4.

c.4 so(d, d, z) spinor and conjugate spinor eisenstein series

more generally, we can compute for all n the leading term for the spinor eisenstein series,
obtained by setting all charges m[3] = m[5] = . . . = 0 except m[1], so that the constraints
are trivial. this shows that

e so(d,d,z)

+ . . . = v s

d e sl(d,z)

d;s

+ . . .

(c.24)

so that, for s = 1, we observe the leading term in (3.33a).

for the conjugate spinor, we can go even further and obtain the rst two leading terms.
focusing on the contributions from m and m[2] only and setting m[4] = m[6] = . . . = 0 (so
that the constraints can be ignored) we nd that

e so(d,d,z)

c;s

(c.25)

here, the leading term is obtained from m[2] = 0, while the second term follows after
poisson resummation on the unconstrained m in the remainder and setting (the dual)
m = 0. substituting s = 1 we immediately recognize the leading term 2
