bosons worldsheet see dierent target spaces, vacua usually simple geometrical interpretation. vacua potentially in- teresting phenomenology typically moduli. certain cases, moduli except dilaton projected . since spaces geometrical interpretation, dicult ascertain lie web string dualities. particular, unknown whether orbifolds smoothly connected large volume calabi-yau spaces. consequence, m-theoretic interpretation vacua missing. based experience string dualities, natural guess clue understanding non-perturbative structure orb- ifolds understanding d-brane spectra. d-branes shown probe sub-stringy structure, cases (e.g. symmet- ric orbifolds), metric d-brane worldvolume reproduces expected properties underlying geometry {$9610140$}. great interest, therefore, analyze moduli space metric cases underlying geometric structure known, case asymmetric orbifolds. furthermore, d-branes control strong coupling behaviour theory many cases, knowledge d-brane spectra constrains possible dual models, may also suggest guesses dual theory. asymmetric orbifolds also arisen recent attempt construct non-supersymmetric vacua zero cosmological constant {$9807076$}. shown particular model
