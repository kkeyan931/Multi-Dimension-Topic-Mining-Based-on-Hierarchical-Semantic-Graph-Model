abstract

we consider scalar eld theories in dimensions lower than four in
the context of the wegner-houghton renormalization group equations
(whrg). the renormalized trajectory makes a non-perturbative in-
terpolation between the ultraviolet and the infrared scaling regimes.
strong indication is found that in two dimensions and below the mod-
els with polynomial interaction are always non-perturbative in the
infrared scaling regime. finally we check that these results do not
depend on the regularization and we develop a lattice version of the
whrg in two dimensions.

1 introduction

asymptotically free models gained importance both in high energy and in
condensed matter physics. this is obvious for the latter, where the low
dimensional phenomena invoke eective theories below the upper critical
dimension, d = 4, which are super-renormalizable and their hamiltonians
contain asymptotically free coupling constants only. in the former case the
impressive success of the perturbation methods in qed was overshadowed by
the discovery of the uv landau pole, which made the high energy structure
of the theory non-perturbative and spoiled the proof of perturbative renor-
malizability. such a deterioration of the perturbation expansion has been
observed in the four-dimensional 4 model, too. this model which served as
the training ground for perturbative renormalization turned out to be non-
renormalizable, as qed. the lesson is that the cuto can not be removed
from the non-asymptotically free models, in agreement with the identica-
tion of the non-renormalizable coupling constants with the irrelevant param-
eters of the ultraviolet scaling regime described by the renormalization group
method [1]. in other words, only the asymptotically free models can provide
structureless high energy physics where the cuto can be pushed away at
will.

what kind of non-perturbative mechanisms do we encounter as we follow
the renormalization group ow? this depends on the momentum scale the
non-perturbative eect originates. the non-perturbative eects may arise at
nite, i.e. cuto-independent scales only because the perturbation expansion
is reliable in the uv regime where the kinetic energy dominates the action. to
distinguish dierent nite energy mechanisms we recall that unless the model
possesses unbroken scale invariance there are always two scaling regimes, an
ultraviolet and an infrared one separated by a crossover at the characteristic
scale of the model. if there is a dimensional coupling constant, say a mass
parameter m, in the lagrangian then the uv and ir scaling regimes are sep-
arated by a crossover at p = pcr  m because m2/p2 or p2/m2 is treated as
a small quantity in the uv or the ir side, respectively. the ir scaling laws
are trivial because the radiative corrections to the evolution are suppressed
by p2/m2 and what is left is the scale dependence governed by the canonical
dimensions of the coupling constants. if there are no dimensional coupling
constants in the lagrangian, i.e. the model possesses classical scale invari-
ance then a crossover can be identied where one of the coupling constants
reach the value 1, g(pcr) = 1. the expression for the dimensionless running

2

coupling constant g(p) must contain a dimensional parameter, usually called
the -parameter and pcr  4. it is worthwhile noting that one can intro-
duce the -parameter even in the presence of any parameter with positive
mass dimension in the lagrangian so long as the ir dynamics remains sta-
ble when this latter is removed. in fact, let us write this parameter as m
where m dened in this manner is the mass scale of the model. the running
coupling constant depends on the ratio m/p, g(p) = f (m/p) where the limit
m  0 is convergent. in other words, the evolution of the classically scale
invariant system is recovered as p  .
non-perturbative eects may originate in the ir scaling regimes. the
classically scale invariant models at the lower critical dimension, such as the
two-dimensional sigma and the gross-neveu model do not support long range
order. thus the ir scaling laws must contain a dynamically generated mass
scale. another source of non-perturbative dynamics comes from the infrared
or collinear divergences.

the asymptotically free coupling constants may generate non-perturbative
eects in the uv scaling regime, as well, due to their growth. the question is
whether the scale parameter 4 or the mass m is reached rst as we lower the
cuto. the system remains perturbative for m > 4 because the ir scaling
laws cut o the growth of the asymptotically free coupling constants before
they would reach a dangerously large value. the dynamics of the modes
p < 4 becomes non-perturbative when 4 > m. the four-dimensional
yang-mills models develops linearly rising potential between static external
charges. this is believed to happen due to the large value of the asymptoti-
cally free coupling constant at the ultraviolet side of the crossover, indicated
by the infrared landau pole in perturbative qcd. the quark masses are
supposed to play no important role in the vacuum structure and the chiral
limit m  0 is assumed to be safe and convergent, though non-perturbative.
the infrared singularities are easier to isolate, as it has already been
achieved for non-asymptotically free models [2] and superrenormalizable the-
ories [3]. the more complex non-perturbative features should arise at the
ultraviolet side of the crossover where no asymptotic analysis is available.
the study of the scaling laws in this regime is the goal of the present pa-
per.
in order to defuse the infrared problem we turn to the scalar model
with polynomial interaction in the phase where no spontaneous symmetry
breaking occurs. the term n in the lagrangian of the d-dimensional scalar
model is asymptotically free for n < 2d/(d  2), so we have to trace the
evolution of a large number of coupling constants at low dimensions. a

3

powerful realization of the renormalization group idea which is needed here
is based on the innitesimal renormalization group step and known as the
wegner-houghton equation [4] what we use in the local potential approxi-
mation in this work. the higher order terms of the gradient expansion are
non-renormalizable according to the power counting. we believe that these
coupling constants which are irrelevant in the ultraviolet scaling regime do
not modify our qualitative conclusion.

the study of the asymptotically free three-dimensional 6 model can bring
some light into the ir landau pole problem of four-dimensional gauge the-
ories by considering the role of the non-renormalizable couplings in the ir
extrapolation of the uv scaling regime. we will show that they aect consid-
erably the evolution of the relevant couplings. this points to the possibility
that the non-renormalizable couplings could suppress the landau pole. the
full solution of the theory where all possible coupling constants are followed
by the renormalization group equation should necessarily yield a non-singular
renormalization group ow so long as the theory possesses local interactions.
this suggests that the introduction of the hadronic composite operators in
qcd could defuse its landau pole problem [5].

it is well known that massive lagrangians generate trivial infrared scal-
ing laws, i.e. the gaussian mass term is the only relevant operator in the
infrared scaling regime. this is because the uctuations are exponentially
suppressed beyond the correlation length so the evolution of the coupling
constants slows down at the infrared side of the crossover. the theories with
dimensional transmutation, i.e. dynamically generated scale parameter or
infrared instability only can support non-perturbative dynamics in the ir
scaling regime.

suppose that we x the values of the coupling constants at the cuto. the
appearance of non-perturbative eects is obvious if the uv scaling regime is
suciently long, when the asymptotically free coupling constants are growing
in a large scale region. the numerical results showed in this paper suggest
that the length of the uv scaling regime which is needed to generate non-
perturbative dynamics in the infrared shrinks to zero as the number of the
asymptotically free coupling constants tends to innity. in other words, the
-parameter tends to the cuto as the lower critical dimension is approached,
d  2. such a behavior limits considerably the values of the coupling con-
stants for a perturbative system in dimension 3 and renders all two- and
lower dimensional eld theories with polynomial couplings non-perturbative.
this makes the understanding of the noncritical low dimensional condensed

4

matter systems more involved. viewed with interest in particle physics our
conclusion suggests an interesting analogy between the infrared landau pole
of the conning four-dimensional yang-mills theories and the low dimen-
sional scalar models and opens the possibility of an unexpected, nontrivial
structure in the asymptotic states in the low dimensional scalar models. the
one-dimensional models belong to rst quantized quantum mechanics and our
result is a manifestation of the failure of the convergence of the perturbation
expansion for an anharmonic oscillator.

another important issue addressed in this paper is the way the non-
universal eects die out as the cuto is lowered. this question is of cen-
tral importance for eective theories where it provides an upper limit for
the ultraviolet cuto. we studied this question in the framework of lattice
regulation by tailoring the wegner-houghton equation for lattice regulated
models. as a result, the approach to the universal low energy physics can
be compared for momentum space cuto in the continuum and for lattice
regularization.

the organization of this paper is the following. the innitesimal renor-
malization group step, the wegner-houghton equation, is described in sec-
tion ii. the running coupling constants are introduced and their evolution
equations are given in section iii for scalar models. the asymptotic uv evo-
lution is discussed in section iv for d = 2, 3 and 4. section v is devoted to
the demonstration of the diculties in nding a perturbative model in d = 2.
the wegner-houghton equation is derived in the lattice regularization and
its solution is presented in section vi. section vii is for the conclusions.

2 the wegner-houghton equation

the wegner-houghton (wh) equation [4] describes the evolution of the ef-
fective action as the cuto is lowered. as mentioned in the introduction we
shall consider scalar model with an intrinsic mass scale which allows to clearly
distinguish the uv and ir scaling regimes regimes. we derive the wh equa-
tion for a scalar eld theory by using a sharp momentum space cuto [5, 6]:
we will call this regularization procedure the continuum regularization. in
section 6 we consider an alternative, the lattice regularization.

denote the bare action by sk[], where k is the uv cuto. then, accord-

ing to the usual wilson-kadano procedure,

 sk [] =z d e 1

 sk[+]

(1)

where k < k in the euclidean space-time. the fourier transform of the elds
(x) and (x) is non-vanishing only for p < k and k < p < k, respectively.
the right hand side is evaluated by means of the loop expansion, so that
eq. (1) gives

sk[] = sk[ +

where

2s(x, y) =

and the saddle point, 

0, is dened by the extremum condition

in which the infrared background eld, (x), is held xed. it can be proved
0 = 0, as long as the matrix 2s(x, y) is
that the saddle point is trivial, 
invertible and the ir background eld is homogeneous, (x) = .

now, each successive loop integral in the n-loop contributions which are

not explicitly written in eq. (2) brings a suppression factor

kd  kd
kd = o(cid:18) k  k
k (cid:19)

(5)

due to the integration volume in the momentum space. thus k/k = (k 
k)/k appears as a new small parameter which suppresses the higher loop
contributions in the blocking relation and the exact functional dierential
equation obtained in the limit k  0 includes the one-loop contribution
only. but we should bear in mind that the loop expansion had to be used
at the initial stage of the derivation so the resulting exact equation might
be unreliable in the strong coupling situation. all we know is that the loop
corrections to the evolution equation obtained in the one loop level are van-
ishing.

we will use the gradient expansion for the action,

s[] =



xn=0z ddx un((x), 2n),

(6)

where un is an homogeneous function of order 2n in the derivative. in the
leading order of this expansion, the so-called local potential approximation,
we have

s[] =z ddx(cid:20) z()

2

()2 + u()(cid:21) ,

(7)

and furthermore the simplication z() = 1 will be used to derive a simple
dierential equation for the potential u. this local potential will be then
the only function characterizing the action. if we use now a homogeneous
infrared background eld, (x) = , we obtain from eqs. (2) and (7) an
equation for the local potential uk( = ):

ukk() = uk() +

up to a eld independent constant. this is the usual one loop resummation
of the eective potential [7] except that the loop momentum is now restricted
to the subspace of the modes to be eliminated. actually, the fact that the
r.h.s. includes the running potential uk() rather than the bare one, u(),
indicates that the contributions of the successive eliminations of the degrees
of freedom are piled up during the integration of the dierential equation and
the solution of the renormalization group equation resums the perturbation
series. the solution of the dierential equation interpolates between the bare
and the eective potential as k is lowered from the original cuto  to zero.
finally, let us note that the derivation of eq. (11) shows that the restoring
force for the uctuations into the equilibrium is proportional to the argument
of the logarithm function. thus a nontrivial saddle point should be used when

k2 + u 

k ()  0.

our eective action is

sk =z ddx(cid:20)1

(14)

(15)

and the initial condition for the evolution equation is given at k = . the
potential uk() is assumed to be polynomial so it is expanded as

uk() =

1
n!

xn=0

gn(0)(  0)n.

(16)

we study the model in the symmetric phase, where the saddle point is trivial,
0 = 0. the polynomial structure of the potential is consistent because we

occurs in a region around  = 0 in the symmetry broken phase [6].

taking the n-th derivative of eq. (16) at  = 0 we obtain the coupling

the coupling constants dened through eq. (16) are dimensional param-
eters (the eld variable  has dimension (d2)/2). however, the correspond-
ing dimensionless parameters have more physical sense. we obtain them in
the following way:

gn(k) = kn(1 d

2 )dgn(k) = (k)n(1 d

2 )dgn(k),

(22)

where now k runs from 1 to 0. their beta functions are

n = (cid:20)n(cid:18)1

2(cid:19) + d(cid:21) gn + kn(1 d

2 )dn,

(23)

where the rst and the second term stands for the tree-level and the loop
corrections, respectively. one can see that the super-renormalizable coupling
constants follow asymptotically free scaling law at the tree level.

4 uv scaling laws and their extensions

one can distinguish an ultraviolet and an infrared scaling regime, for k2 
|m2(k)| and for k2  |m2(k)|, respectively.
in the uv regime the scale
dependence comes dominantly from the k2 term of the propagator, see the
denominator of eq. (19); the k-dependence is generated by the phase factor
kd in the ir regime where k2 could be neglected in the inverse propagator.
we will begin at the uv scale with the usual 4 potential (g2  m2)

v() =

and see how the dierent couplings are generated when we move towards the
ir regime.

(26)

this expression agrees with the result of the minimal subtraction (ms), a
scheme which proved to be specially convenient in the ultraviolet scaling
regime.
it is based on the analytical continuation of the loop integrals in
the ultraviolet domain so the resulting beta functions are mass independent,
i.e. the terms o(g2/k2) are neglected. when extrapolating to the infrared
regime we nd erroneously the mass independent result g4  k4d (g4 
log k in d = 4), g4 tends to zero as k  0. this can be understood by
inspecting (25) where we nd large positive values in the infrared for g4 6= 0
(this conclusion remains valid for nite g6, as well). when the mass term is
retained the beta function assumes the correct behavior and becomes o(kd)
in the infrared. note that the term with g6 acts in the opposite manner than
g4, c.f. the dierent signs in the right hand side of (25), so that it can change
the evolution considerably.

it is instructive to look into the evolution of the dimensionless coupling

constant,

.

(27)

for 4d > 0 the one-loop  = 4d universal critical exponent is reached for
suciently below the cuto where k/  0. the latter condition is needed to
get rid of the non-universal cuto eects. the scaling changes qualitatively
as d  4 because the non-universal k   behavior is spread over the whole
k range due to the smallness of 4 d. this is what happens in the expansion

1 (cid:18) k

(28)

employed in the dimensional regularization scheme. this generalizes to any
dimension: the marginal coupling constant follows the scaling law extended
from the non-universal cuto regime.
the evolution for g2 is of the form

in lacking of any dimensional constant.

in the ir scaling regime we neglect the k2 term in the denominator of
eq. (19) and using eqs. (18) and (21), we get for g4 (assuming again g6 = 0),

dg4

(31)

this evolution is much slower comparing with eq. (26). in fact, for d > 1 we
have now a suppression factor kd1 which makes the coupling to stabilize at
the attractive ir xed point. in the same way, we obtain for g2

dg2
dk

2(2)d kd1 g4

(32)

with a variation which is slower than that predicted by the uv scaling and
a suppression factor for k  0.
we see that the extraction of the scaling in the limit k  0 from the
uv scaling laws, which is the commonly accepted practice in perturbation
theory is incorrect when the ms scheme is used. one has to come back to
the complete scaling laws in order to describe correctly the ir scaling.

four-dimensional asymptotically free gauge models present an infrared
landau pole in perturbation theory. but this behavior results from the ex-
trapolation from the uv scaling laws. as we have just remarked, the ir limit
of the uv regime is not correct in general, and the mass term can change
considerably the actual behavior in the ir. moreover, at the ir side of the
uv regime, there are nonlinear eects that make important the contribution
of the irrelevant (non-renormalizable) couplings (see fig. 3 (b), commented
in the next section), therefore even the ir limit of the uv scaling can be
inuenced by these couplings. these ideas have been considered qualitatively
in the previous paragraphs, after inspection of eq. (25). let us now examine
them more quantitatively.

we take as an example of asymptotically free model the scalar theory in
three dimensions. we know from the epsilon-expansion result [8] that below
four dimensions, the 4 theory does not present an infrared landau pole,
but a xed point located at

 =

162

3

,

(33)

at order  = 4  d. this is the wilson-fisher xed point. for nite , for
example in two and three dimensions, we can get this one-loop result from

12

our beta functions of the dimensionless coupling constants obtained from
eqs. (23) and (18) in the asymptotic uv regime (that is, ignoring g2), which
for the g4 coupling give

restricting ourselves to the d = 3 case, we nd

(34)

(35)

(36)

however, in three dimensions g6 is a marginal coupling, and it can be gen-
erated by the rg ow, modifying the position of the xed point (36). if we
include g6 in our analysis, we get the beta functions

it is immediate to see that the zeros of these beta functions are at the point

(38)

but now let us consider the inclusion of a non-renormalizable coupling, g8.

these values are also obtained in the numerical integration of eqs. (39),
independently of the initial values for the dierent couplings (if they are
dierent from zero, which corresponds to the gaussian xed point). as
we have expected, the non-renormalizable coupling g8 modies the position
of the xed point without changing the blocking procedure, turning to a
situation of strong coupling dynamics in the ir. this is because the linearity
which one assumes to ignore the irrelevant coupling constants is no longer
valid in the strong coupling regime. as g4 and g6 approach their large ir
xed point the linearization fails and new scaling laws are found which in turn
generate new relevant operators [6], overlapping with 8. thus the strong
coupling dynamics may induce a new (and articial) ir scaling regime even if
the uv scaling laws are extrapolated down to low energies. nothing unusual
happens for innitesimal  when one stays in the vicinity of the gaussian
xed point.

so far we considered the extrapolation of the uv scaling laws to the
ir regime. does the conclusion concerning the importance of the non-
renormalizable coupling constant g8 remains valid when the true evolution
equation, with g2 6= 0, is considered? the mass slows down the evolution
but this may happen too late and the strong coupling eects can be found
on the true renormalization group trajectory for small enough renormal-
ized mass, close enough to the critical point. when the mass is large then
crossover freezes the evolution of the coupling constants earlier and the
linearization remains valid. to demonstrate this case recall that the ir limit
of the uv regime means a xed point for the dimensionless couplings. for
a super-renormalizable coupling constant such as g4, which has positive di-
mension, this would mean that the dimensional coupling goes to zero when
k  0. however, we know that for a relevant coupling, the dimensionless
quantity diverges when k  0, so that the dimensional coupling will take
a nite value at the ir. this reasoning can be explicitly checked in fig. 1,
in which we consider the d = 3 scalar theory with just one coupling, g4.
the white points follow the evolution of the uv regime and its extrapola-
tion to k = 0. we observe that indeed the dimensionless coupling reaches

the xed point given by eq. (36), while the dimensional coupling goes to
zero. however, if one considers the complete beta function, i.e. retaining
g2 (black points), the behavior is the same in the uv regime, but then the
true trajectory separates from the ir limit of this regime and enters into the
actual ir regime, which implies a divergent dimensionless coupling at k = 0,
and a certain nite value of the dimensional coupling, as explained above.
one can however see numerically that this nite value is stable and almost
does not change when one introduces more and more non-renormalizable
couplings in the rg evolution. this is what one expects when the crossover
captures the coupling constants and slows down their evolution in the regime
of linearizability where the non-renormalizable couplings are unimportant.

in the same way, it might well be that the ir landau pole observed in
four-dimensional gauge theories is just an artifact of a wrong ir limit or the

15

truncation of the renormalized action. first, the nature of the singularity
can change when one adds non-renormalizable couplings, and then the ir
landau pole would be the reection of the insucient functional form of the
blocked action, and second, the true ir trajectory can be quite dierent from
the ir limit of the uv scaling.

5 asymptotic freedom and the perturbation

expansion

we examine in this section the scaling laws in dimensions d = 2, 3 and 4
from the point of view of the applicability of the perturbation expansion. we
adopt the convention that a model with positive renormalized mass square is
non-perturbative in the vertex gnn if the radiative correction o(gn) to the
self energy is stronger than the mass term, i.e.

gn(k)

((n  2)/2)! 2(n2)/2 m2(k)  1

(41)

where m2(k) = g2(k). the question we are interested in is whether this
inequality is satised in the infrared, which would indicate the invalidity
of renormalized perturbation expansion. since the neglected higher order
vertices may inuence the evolution while we lower the cuto, we have to
address the problem of the system of coupled equations numerically.

there are two asymptotic scaling regimes, k   and k  0 in our
model. the latter one is trivial as mentioned above, the beta functions (18)
are suppressed by the factor kd and the evolution of the dimensional coupling
constants slows down as k  0. the asymptotic uv scaling is more involved.
the super-renormalizable (relevant) and the renormalizable (marginal) cou-
pling constants, gn with n < 2d/(d  2) and n = 2d/(d  2) according to the
power counting, respectively, follow their autonomous evolution, the univer-
sal renormalized trajectory1. the non-renormalizable (irrelevant) coupling
constants forget quickly their initial value and take values which are gen-
erated by the universal ow. this general trend is demonstrated by the
renormalization group ow shown for d = 4 and 3 in figs. 2 and 3, respec-
tively. the dimensionless coupling constants are displayed as the functions of
the cuto which is measured in the units of the initial cuto value, k  k.
1ignoring the triviality in d = 4 where the tree level marginal coupling constant g4 is

actually irrelevant due to the radiative corrections.

16

the evolution of a non-renormalizable coupling constant, g6 in four di-
mensions, is shown in fig. 2. the irrelevance is expressed by the indepen-
dence of g6(k) on the initial value g6(1) for k  12. the value given in the
leading order of the perturbation expansion,3 o(g3
4), is reached at k  0.3
for not too large values of g6(1). since the model is in the weak coupling
regime the evolution is rather slow after arriving at this universal value if the
cuto is high enough to provide a long scaling regime. in our case the scale
window 0.3 < k < 1 was insucient and the plateau is reduced into a peak at
k  0.3 before the crossover. but the bringing of g6(1) close to the universal
value creates a plateau even with this limited range of the scales as it can
be seen for g6(1) = 9  108. such a scale independence is the ultimate goal
of the improved action program [9]. as the initial value increases beyond
the plateau level the coupling constant decreases in a monotonous manner
as the cuto is lowered. in order to check the critical exponent coming from
the linearized blocking we need a g6(k) larger than the universal value since
the latter originates in the nonlinear level, o(g3
4). the evolution follows the
linear relation g6  k2 for k < 1 indicated by the dashed line in the last plot
of fig. 2. the infrared scaling regime is 0 < k < 0.1 where g6(k) tends to
zero with k along the universal trajectory. the theory remains perturbative
in d = 4 since it has no relevant non-gaussian coupling constant.

the three-dimensional renormalization group ow is depicted in fig. 3.
the asymptotic infrared scaling laws are rather simple, the super-renormal-
izable coupling constants diverge, the renormalizable one n = 6 converges
and the non-renormalizable ones tend to zero in the infrared, k  0. the
ultraviolet scaling law, above k  0.1 indicates the weak, radiative correction
generated relevance of g6 for the given initial conditions, gn(1). the insensi-
tivity on the initial condition g8(1) for k < 0.3 seen in the last plot supports
the irrelevance of g8. in fact, the evolution of g8(k) follows the linearized
scaling law as long as its value is far form the universal o(g4
4) value. it is
worthwhile noting that the non-renormalizable coupling constants gn(k) al-
ways develop a peak of sign (1)1+n/2 around the crossover, k  0.1. the
appearance of the peak can be understood as the result of the increase of
|gn(k)| from zero as the cuto is lowered in the ultraviolet scaling regime and
the decrease in the infrared side of the crossover.

2the dierent initial value for the non-renormalizable coupling constants may induce
a dierent overall scale factor. this eect is very weak in our case due to the smallness of
the renormalizable coupling constants.

3which is not applicable for the strongly coupled case (38) or (40).

the values of g6(1) = 0.0, 4  108, 9  108, 107 for the dierent lines in
plot (a), and g6(1) = 103 for plot (b). in this last plot the points of the
numerical renormalization group ow are joined by the linearized scaling
g6  k2, shown by a dashed line.

non-perturbative phenomena may arise at the low energy edge of the
uv scaling regime due to the increase of the asymptotically free coupling
constants, g4 and g6 if the scaling regime is long enough and the initial value of
the coupling constants g4(1) and g6(1) are large enough. there is however no
problem in nding a perturbative, asymptotically free theory in the infrared.
the parameter with the highest energy dimension in the lagrangian is g2 =
m2 for d > 2. thus g2 is the largest among the dimensionless coupling
constants according to eq. (23), and it dominates the action and renders
the theory perturbative in the ir limit. the comparison of this conclusion
with eq. (40) reveals the necessity of treating the ir scaling laws properly
in establishing the validity of the renormalized perturbation expansion.

renormalizable. the fastest increasing dimensionless non-gaussian coupling
constant during the decrease of the cuto is g4. the critical exponent, the
measure of the speed of the increase become degenerate for innitely many
coupling constants when d = 2. the specialty of the lower critical dimension
is the existence of innitely many super-renormalizable coupling constants,
gn, with equal critical dimension. this degeneracy of the dimensions evolves
the non-gaussian pieces of the action with the same rate as the mass term
on the tree level and the theories are not obviously perturbative any more.
in other words, it remains for the radiative corrections, the last term in the
right hand side of eq. (23) to determine if the theory runs into weak- or
strong-coupling regime at the infrared.

the renormalization group equations were integrated out numerically in
two dimensions with the initial conditions (gi
n =
0, n > 4) to nd the evolution of the coupling constants. the result, depicted
in fig. 4, shows a marked increase at the low energy end of the uv scaling
regime. this increase originates from the asymptotically free evolution. the
relevant behavior of a coupling constant is dened on the linearized level of
the blocking, i.e.
in the leading order of the perturbation expansion. this
one-loop result can be obtained by replacing the running coupling constants

the comparison of the numerical solution with the one-loop evolution is
shown in fig. 5. the one-loop formula (42) cannot be extended down to
k = 0, because there will be a value of k such that k2+m2() = 0, since m2()
is negative. but we only want to compare the results in the perturbative
regime. so we have stopped the evolution in fig. 5 at k  0.3. one can also
see an increase in the one-loop solution at small k which accumulates and
drives the system non-perturbative at lower values of k.

4 = 0.01, gi

the numerical results of fig. 4 show that the initial conditions (gi

2 =

n = 0, n > 4) correspond to a non-perturbative system.
can we nd initial conditions which yield perturbative dynamics? in order
to answer this question the left hand side of the inequality (41) is plotted
against the initial value for g2 on fig. 6, for the dierent couplings up to
n = 20, at a value of gi
4 = 0.001. the result does not change qualitatively

for dierent values of bare g4. it supports the general trend of having the
systems more perturbative when the gaussian part of the action is increased.
the higher order coupling constants tend to grow faster but it seems that
gn can be brought into the perturbative regime for suciently large initial
mass square. at gi
2 = 0.01, for example, all the couplings are perturbative,
and this perturbative character is more pronounced for the high couplings.
however, the separation between the values of the l.h.s. ratio of eq. (41) at
gi
2 = 0.01 is smaller as we go to higher couplings, and one can ask whether
it has got a limiting value or the trend can be reversed for a suciently
high order coupling. indeed, fig. 7 reveals that this happens for the n = 24
coupling (n = 26), which suggests that one will have a non-perturbative
situation also at this value of bare g2 going to a suciently high order coupling
constant. the situation is the same, even stronger, below two dimensions:
the existence of an innite number of relevant couplings makes that one
cannot assure perturbativity by looking to a nite number of couplings, no
matter what the initial conditions are. we take this and similar other failures
in nding a perturbative theory observed at dierent initial conditions as a
strong numerical indication of the non-perturbative nature of any two and
lower dimensional scalar eld theory with polynomial interaction.

6 lattice wegner-houghton equation

the previous sections dealt with the renormalization group ow at nite
scales. we address now a dierent issue, the manner the sensitivity on the
initial values of the irrelevant coupling constants is reached in the asymp-
totic ultraviolet scaling regime. the renormalization group equation will be
presented with a dierent cuto, on the lattice. since the change of the
cuto amounts to the introduction of irrelevant coupling constants the lat-
tice renormalization group ow must converge at the one obtained in the
continuum.

some words of caution are in order at this point. one would object the
interpretation of the modication of the cuto as the introduction of new
irrelevant coupling constants by recalling that the theory ceases to be renor-
malizable in the presence of the non-renormalizable (irrelevant) couplings.
the resolution of the apparent paradox is based on the dierence between
the ways the renormalization group is used in statistical and high energy
physics. we are interested in the dynamics close to the cuto in statisti-
cal physics and this is respected by the employment of the blocking which
keeps the complete dynamics unchanged below the actual cuto. the price
of this precision is the appearance of the innitely many irrelevant coupling
constants in the action. we seek the dynamics at nite, xed scales in high

23

energy physics. since the cuto is sent to the innity this boils down the
problem of keeping the physics cuto independent far from the cuto only.
the obvious gain of such an ease of the conditions is the freedom from the
adjustment of the non-renormalizable parameters. thus one can remove
the cuto when the non-renormalizable parameters are present in the action
without any problem4 as long as the renormalization conditions are imposed
far from the cuto.

the lattice regularization of the scalar model can be described by using
the momentum space as the introduction of the non-renormalizable higher
order derivative terms,

the cuto dependence of the non-renormalizable coupling constants follow
a tree-level relation arising from the taylor expansion of the sine function.
this is sucient to establish convergent physics at nite scales when a  0
[10], a claim to be veried in this section numerically by means of the im-
plementation of the wegner-houghton scheme on the lattice. the only eect
the dierent adjustments of the non-renormalized coupling constants may
leave on the nite scale physics can be comprised in an overall scale factor.
an addition bonus will be the verication of the regularization independence
of the results described in the previous section.

it is rather straightforward to repeat the steps leading to eq. (11) on the
lattice.
it is shown in the appendix that the only change required is the
modication of the solid angle factor, (k): the lattice evolution equation
(71) is obtained from eq. (11) by replacing eq. (12) by eq. (68). one recovers
the continuum solid angle for d = 2, 2 = 2, in eq. (68) as k  0, thus
the wh equations agree in the ir limit. in fact, one sees numerically that
the behavior of the evolution of the dierent coupling constants in the lattice
rg is qualitatively the same than in the continuum case. but the question
we are interested in is the relation between the regularizations in the uv,
where the coupling constants are introduced, when the physics is the same
at nite scales. it is shown in the appendix that there is a natural relation

4ignoring again the possibility of the triviality, the appearance of an uv landau pole.

24

between the cutos, 2 = 8/a2, which matches the nite scale physics. we
shall follow the renormalization group ow in terms of the coupling constants
whose dimension is removed by the initial value of the cuto,

gn  gn/2,
in order to avoid the singularities at k = 0.

(45)

let us consider 4 lattice theory which can be studied either numerically
or analytically and whose properties can be matched to those of the contin-
uum theory by the adjustment of g2 and g4. but the situation is more involved
in two dimensions. the reason is again that there are innitely many renor-
malizable coupling constants and one cannot match the nite scale physics
by adjusting g2 and g4. this is demonstrated in fig. 8 where the lattice
model with the initial conditions m2(8) = g2(8) = 0.001, g4(8) = 0.01, and
gn(8) = 0, n > 4 (where we have already made the rescaling eq. (45)) was
evolved in the infrared direction. as the system reached k = kend the contin-
uum wh equation was used to increase the cuto. the result is a perfect
matching of the models in the uv which gives the same low energy physics
in the ir. as we can see in fig. 8, the lattice 4 model in two dimensions
is not the continuum 4 theory. it contains contributions of innitely many
renormalizable other coupling constants. of course, numerically we had to
truncate the equations at a certain coupling (here, at o(22)) but we checked
that these truncation eect hardly inuences the values of the low order
coupling constants.

we have taken for the parameter k2

cr  0.01. we had to use k2

end the value k2 = 0.3 in fig. 8, while
the crossover is at k2
cr, because the high
order couplings have very large values at the crossover which requires very

should also be suciently small that the ow be universal there, in other
words to make sure that the irrelevant lattice contributions are suppressed

the ow to a universal curve, extracted from fig. 8.

below the suv regime only. the fact that the renormalization group ow
converges to the universal one in the 2d-th part of the brioullin zone only
sets an unexpected high lower limit on the lattice size when the continuum
limit is sought in numerical simulations. the higher order vertices seem to
converge to the universal curve from the very beginning but the dierence
between the two regularizations is surprisingly large. the universal trajectory
of the 4 model is reached later by the higher order vertices. this eect
appears to be a counterpart of the non-perturbative features seen in figs. 6, 7
and introduces a large uncertainty in identifying two-dimensional models in
dierent regularizations.

7 conclusions

the renormalization group ow of scalar models with polynomial interaction
is considered in the rst part of this paper by solving the wegner-houghton
equation numerically in the local potential approximation for d = 2, 3 and
4. a lesson learn for qcd in studying the three-dimensional 6 model is the
possibility of avoiding the ir landau pole by following the evolution of the
non-renormalizable operators.

no model with polynomial interaction was found in two dimensions whose

27

all coupling strength remain small. this suggests the conclusion that every
two- and lower dimensional models with polynomial interaction are non-
perturbative at the infrared due to the strong increase of the super-renor-
malizable coupling constants. this conclusion does not invalidate the well
known results for two-dimensional systems, such as the applicability of the
bethe ansatz, bosonization and the availability of certain exact information
for models with conform invariance. instead, it makes the asymptotic state
structure and the relation between the the dressed particles and the states
created by the application of the eld operator from the vacuum more in-
volved.

in the second part of the paper the innitesimal renormalization group
scheme is generalized for lattice regularization. the matching of the con-
tinuum and the lattice regularizations is carried out numerically and the
approach of the universal renormalization group ow is demonstrated for the
two-dimensional 4 lattice model.

appendix

the details of the derivation of the wegner-houghton equation in the lattice
regularization are given in this appendix. let us consider the scalar eld
theory regularized on a lattice of lattice spacing a = 1. we want to derive
a wh equation similar to eq. (11). we integrate over spherical shells in the
momentum space for the continuum regularization, because the propagator
has spherical symmetry. this is no longer the case on the lattice, where we

we can see in fig. 9 the form of the curves of constant propagator for several
values of p2. p can be identied as the momentum scale that runs from
the cuto at p2 = 2 = 8 to the ir p2 = 0. it is also clear in that gure that
the value p2 = 4 separates two regimes, still in the ultraviolet region, that
we could call super-uv (suv), for 8 > p2 > 4, and normal-uv regimes. for
p2  0, the lines are spheres, and our change of variables (48) reduces to the
usual relation between cartesian and polar coordinates.

this integral is related again [11] to an elliptic integral and an hypergeometric
function:

(k) =

k2 f (cid:18)1

(cid:19) .

(61)

we would like to have a common expression for (k) for both cases (i)
and (ii). from eqs. (57) and (61), we nd in fact that the expressions dier

31

in a factor 2 for k2 = 4! the reason is that actually our integral is divergent
at this point. from eq. (51) we see that the divergent integral is

(k2 = 4) =z 2

d

| sin 2|

(62)

(in fact, the hypergeometric function (56) converges in general only in the
unit circle |z| < 1 [11]). we will see, however, that this divergence is inte-
grable during the rg evolution from k2 = 8 to k2 = 0, and therefore it has
no physical signicance. in order to have a consistent, single expression for
the cases 8 < k2 < 4 and 4 < k2 < 0, we will make use of the following
property of the hypergeometric functions [11]:

f (cid:18)1

; 1, z2(cid:19) =

f(cid:18)1

; 1,

4z

(1 + z2)2(cid:19) ,

0  z < 1.

(63)

let us consider the expression (57) which is valid for k2 < 4. using the

property (63) one nds,

(k) = 2f(cid:18)1

2

,

; 1,

where we have set

4z

(1 + z2)2(cid:19) = 2(1 + z)f (cid:18)1

2

,

2

; 1; z2(cid:19) ,

4z

(1 + z2)2 =

(8  k2)k2

.

this equation has two solutions for z as a function of k:

z =

k2
8  k2

;

8  k2
k2

,

(64)

(65)

(66)

but only the rst one is admissible for eq. (64), because it gives z < 1 for
k2 < 4, while the second solution gives a value greater than 1 in this region.
now, if we dene k = 8  k2, then we have z = (8  k2)/k2, and eq. (64)
becomes

(k) = 2

8
k2

f(cid:18) 1

2

,

2

; 1; z2(cid:19) .

(67)

comparing this last expression with the result (61) for the case 8 < k2 < 4,
we can nally write

,

(k) =

f(cid:18)1
and (k2 = k2
k2 = 8  k2
the hypergeometric function f (cid:0) 1

if k2 = 4 . . . 0.

from its denition (56). one can obtain a high precision in the evaluation
of the series with a reasonable number of terms (say, around 50) when z is
not very close to 1, say, for 0.7 > z > 0. for 1 > z > 0.7 we have used the
following alternative formula [12]

2 ; 1; z2(cid:1) can be computed directly

f (, ;  + ; z) =

(69)

(70)

which gives a better convergence for the function f (cid:0) 1
because it is a series in the variable (1  z2).
regularization in two dimensions is

in conclusion, our generalization of the wh equation (11) for a lattice
