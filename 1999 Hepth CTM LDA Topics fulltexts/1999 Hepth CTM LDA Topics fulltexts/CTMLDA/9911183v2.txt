abstract

the classical cross section for low energy absorption of the rr-
scalar by a stack of noncommutative d3-branes in the large ns b-eld
limit is calculated. in the spirit of ads/cft correspondence, this cross
section is related to two point function of a certain operator in noncom-
mutative yang-mills theory. compared at the same gauge coupling,
the result agrees with that of obtained from ordinary d3-branes. this
is consistent with the expectation that ordinary and noncommutative
yang-mills theories are equivalent below the noncommutativity scale,
but it is a nontrivial prediction above this scale.

theories on noncommutative spaces arise naturally in string-m theory. in [1], the

system of parallel d-branes has been reinterpreted as a quantum space [2]. dlcq

of m-theory with nonzero background three-form eld along the null compactied

direction has been argued to have matrix theory description of the gauge theory on

noncommutative torus [3]. it has been shown in [4] that the d-brane world volume

theories are noncommutative at a certain limit of the compactication moduli. ap-

plying diracs constrained quantization method to open strings in the presence of ns

two-form (b) eld, the spacetime coordinates of open string end points have been

shown not to commute [5][6]. recently, by a direct string theoretic analysis, it has

been shown in [7] that noncommutativity in the eective action is natural in the pres-

ence of constant background b-eld.

a particularly interesting example of all these is the noncommutative yang-mills

theory (ncym) in four dimensions. the spectrum of iib theory in the presence of

d3-branes on constant b-eld consists of open and closed string excitations coupled

together. however, it is possible to take a low energy limit and scale some param-

eters such that the closed string modes decouple [7]. the resulting theory of open

string modes turn out to be the ncym. in [8][9], a supergravity background has

been proposed to be dual to this system. this background can be obtained by rst

constructing a solution which has nontrivial b-eld dependence and then taking the

decoupling limit of [7]. closed string two point scattering amplitudes in the presence

of b-eld have been calculated and shown to be consistent with the ones encoded in

the gravity solution [11]. in [10], the solution has been shown to have holographic

features. some properties of the ncym have also been studied using its gravity dual

[9][12][13].

in this paper we will consider the process of classical low energy absorption of the

rr-scalar by noncommutative d3-branes in the large b-eld limit. in the spirit of

ads/cft correspondence, the cross section calculated from the gravity side is related

to discontinuity of two point function of a certain operator in the dual ncym [20].

this operator can be deduced from the coupling of the scalar to the d-brane world

volume eective action [14]. the uctuations turn out to be non-minimally coupled

to background geometry. however, the coupling of rr-scalar to the eective world

volume theory is relatively simple which may help one to identify the operator in

ncym. in calculating the absorption cross section, we will work with the d3-brane

solution of [9] before taking the decoupling limit. as discussed in the context of ordi-

2

nary d3-branes in [21], the decoupling limit identies the so called throat region with
a certain limit 2 of the world volume theory. on the other hand, a large b-eld is also
encountered in the decoupling limit considered in [7] 3, which means that the dual
theory is close to its throat limit. for previous work on cross section calculations

on black-brane backgrounds see, for instance, [15]-[22].

of f (c4) is imposed at the level of eld equations. specically b2 denotes the ns two-
form eld and c is the rr-scalar. the solution corresponding to noncommutative

d3-branes is given by [9],

and thus couple to the background geometry non-minimally. we note that the con-

traction (b2)(c2) is zero. respecting the translational invariance, we will assume
that c does not depend on the spatial coordinates of d3-branes. separating the time

dependence and considering a spherically symmetric uctuation (s-wave), which is

supposed to give the dominant contribution to cross section, we write

c = eiwt(r).

since this equation does not appear to be analytically solvable, following previous

work, we try to nd an approximate solution by matching three dierent regions dic-

tated by the structure of the functions f and h. low energy scattering is characterized

by   1 and the  corrections to background is suppressed when /r  1.

consistent with these two restrictions, we will consider the double scaling limit of
[18] and assume r  1. large b-eld corresponds to cos   1 and we will further
analyze the case where cos   r.

(11)

where a1 and a2 are constants.

sion of the bessel and neumann functions

where c is a constant. close to the horizon, we want only an ingoing wave which

implies

c1 = i c2.

(18)

the overall normalization of  can be xed by imposing c1 = i(r)4. to be able to

match the solution (16) to region ii, we consider its behavior when   rcos .

5

assuming cos   r, the arguments of the bessel and neumann functions in (16)
are small in this range and thus we can use the expansion (17). we see that there is

no term in this expansion to be matched by ln  of region ii, therefore, we should set

b2 = 0. the dominant contribution of the rest of the terms when   rcos  is

the constant 4/, which xes b1 as

b1 =

.

(19)

to match (11) to region ii, we will consider its behavior when   r. the
arguments of bessel and neumann functions in (11) are also small in this range. the
leading contributions of their expansions are a1/8 and (4a2)/(4), respectively. to
be able to match these to (14), one should set

a2 = 0,

a1 =

32


.

combining these, we obtain the following functions in three regions

which smoothly overlaps and give an approximate solution to (9)4. to calculate the
cross section one should compare the incoming ux at the horizon with the incoming

ux at the innity. at this stage, we recognize that the same functions appear in

[18] in the solutions of the massless wave equation on ordinary d3-brane background.

the cross section corresponding to the solution (21) can be read from [18] to be

abs =

4
8

3r8.

(22)

we now try to rewrite abs in terms of the gauge coupling constant gy m of ncym.

the solution (2) can be shown to preserve 1/2 supersymmetries of the theory.

this can easily be seen by nothing that (2) is related to ordinary d3-brane solution

by a chain of t-duality transformations (namely, rst a t-duality along x3, then a
rotation by an angle  along the x2  x3 plane, and then another t-duality along

4to ensure that  can be dierentiated twice, one has to let b2 = o(r) and a2 =
o((r)5), instead of setting them to zero. to zeroth order in r, this modication does
not change the main result (22).

x3) and t-duality respects supersymmetry when the killing spinor is independent of
the direction of the duality [23]. from a world-sheet point of view, one can also see

that the parallel d3-branes on constant, invertible, b-eld backgrounds also preserve

1/2 supersymmetries since boundary conditions identify the left moving supercur-

rents with the right moving ones. this is consistent with the identication of this

conguration with the gravity solution. due to this bps property, the noncommuta-

tive d3-brane tension, when calculated from an eective action point of view, should

be equal to the mass per unit volume (6). we will now carry out this eective eld

theory calculation to x the value of r.

the dirac-born-infeld action corresponding to a noncommutative d3-brane can

be written as

sdbi = t3z d4q det(g + b),

where i are coordinates on the d3 brane, t3 is the ordinary d3-brane tension when
b = 0, g and b are pull-backs of at minkowski metric  and constant b-eld b ,
respectively,

(23)

(26)

gij = ix jx  ,
bij = ix jx b .

(24)

(25)

from sdbi , one can calculate the conjugate momentum densities to coordinate elds
x  as

p =

sdbi
 x  ,

where  is the world volume time coordinate.

the tension t3 of a noncommutative d3-brane can be dened as the energy density
corresponding to a at, non-exited brane. this can be described in a physical gauge
by x i = i, x  = const. for such a brane, (26) gives

p = t3q det(ij + bij) 0

,

(27)

which corresponds to the momentum density of a massive object with zero velocity.

the energy per unit volume of such an object can be read from p0 component of the
momentum. this gives the tension for a noncommutative d3-brane as

t3 = t3q det(ij + bij).

(28)

note that the ordinary d3-brane tension and the 10-dimensional gravitational cou-

pling constant are

t3 =

1

(2)32gs

,

22

10 = (2)74.

(29)

in the solution (2), b-eld is a rank 2 matrix. using (28) and (29) we obtain,

t3 =

1

(2)32gs cos 

.

(30)

the total energy of n -coincident d3-branes is given by n t3 which should be equal
to (6). this gives the parameter r as5

r4 =

42gsn

cos 

.

(31)

on the other hand the gauge coupling constant gy m of ncym, can be read from [7]
to be

g2

y m = 2gsq det(ij + bij),

=

2gs
cos 

.

(32)

note that for  = 0, this gives the well known relation between the ordinary yang-

mills and string coupling constants. combining (32) with (31), the cross section (22)

can be rewritten in terms of gy m as

abs =

4
2

34n 2g4

y m .

(33)

remarkably, all  dependence is hidden in gy m . the classical cross section for low
energy absorption of rr-scalar by ordinary d3-branes (which is identical to massless

scalar absorption) has been calculated in [18] and the result is (33) in which gy m
is replaced with the gauge coupling gy m of ordinary yang-mills theory. comparing
ncym with the ordinary yang-mills at the same coupling

gy m = gy m ,

(34)

the result of [18] exactly agrees with (33).

as previously noted, (33) is related to discontinuity of the cut in the two point

function of a certain operator in ncym. the discontinuity in momuntum space is

5 exactly the same expression for r is given in [9].

8

evaluated at p2 = 2. since   1, (33) is valid below the string scale. on
the other hand, since the noncommutativity (nc) scale is roughly given by  cos 
(see, for instance, [7]) and cos   1, nc scale is also below the string scale. be-
low the nc scale, ordinary yang-mills theory is a good approximation to ncym,

and the equivalence of cross sections is consistent with this fact. between nc and

string scales, (33) is a nontrivial prediction for ncym. we note that, (33) is the rst

term in an expansion in the parameter (r), which in ncym corresponds to per-

turbing eld theory by higher and higher dimensional operators and a loop expansion.

the corresponding operators in dual theories can be deduced from the coupling of

the scalars at hand to the eective world volume theories. for the ordinary yang-mills

theory, leading order coupling of rr-scalar to the world volume is

ijklc tr fij fkl.

(35)

the classical cross section for the absorption of rr-scalar by ordinary d3-branes has

been shown to agree with a tree level world volume calculation which involves the

above coupling [19]. this indicates (with a non-renormalization theorem) that the
leading term of the corresponding operator in the dual theory is ijkl tr fij fkl.

naturally, one may try to identify the coupling of rr-scalar to a noncommuta-

tive d3-brane world volume. as discussed in [7], it is very convenient to write the

eective action in terms of the noncommutative gauge elds and open string parame-

ters. when expressed in these variables, the eective action in the presence of b-eld

can be deduced form the ordinary one. from (35), the coupling of rr-scalar to the

noncommutative d3-brane world volume can be written as

ijklc  tr fij  fkl,

(36)

where f is the noncommutative gauge eld strength, -tensor and raising of indices
refer to open string metric and -product is dened by

(f  g)(x) = e

1

2 ij 
i



j f (x + )g(x + )|==0.

(37)

the open string metric and noncommutativity parameter ij is xed in terms of the
background minkowski metric and b-eld [7]. this indicates that the leading order
term of the operator in the ncym is ijkl tr fij  fkl. however, this term is not
gauge invariant unless it is integrated over noncommuting directions.

9

although it brakes the translational invariance, it is interesting to consider the

eects of adding non-zero momentum along the noncommuting directions x2 and x3.
for this, one modies (8) as

c = eiwtei~k.~x(r),

(38)

where ~k.~x = k2x2 + k3x3. due to this modication, (9) picks up an extra term to the
left hand side wich is

 k2f h1,

(39)

2 + k2

where k2 = k2
3. it is easy to see that perturbative scattering requires  > k.
in regions ii and iii, this term can be neglected compared to another term in (9),
namely 2f , since h  1 in these regions and  > k. on the other hand, in region
i, i is modied as

where the parameter s is

i =

32


(s)2j2(s),

s = s1 

k2
2 .

(40)

(41)

the ux at innity calculated from the modied i is changed by a factor of 1/s4
and thus

abs(k) = s4abs(0).

(42)

for ordinary d3-branes, this factor can be calculated to be s8 which seems to imply
a disagreement for dual theories. however, we note that it is dicult to give a world
volume interpretation to cross sections when s 6= 0. for instance, following [18], the
factor of s8 cannot be obtained by a world volume scattering calculation for ordinary
d3-branes. furthermore, due to the fact that the corresponding operator in dual

yang-mills theory is also a scalar operator, the two point function of this operator
can only depend on p2 and the discontinuity in the complex plane can only depend on
2 (or may be with a slight modication on (2k2)) which is not consistent with the
factor s8. we believe that the broken translational invariance ruins the connection
between cross sections and the two point functions, and is responsible for these dis-

agreements. finally, it is also worth to mention that the wave equation for minimally

coupled scalars can be solved exactly in einstein frame and the cross sections agree

to all orders when k = 0 [24].

one may try to repeat same calculations for noncommutative m5-branes using

the solution given in [9]. for ordinary m5-branes, the traceless metric perturbations

10

polarized along the 5-branes have been shown to obey minimally coupled scalar equa-

tions [19]. one can easily show that this is also true for noncommutative m5-branes.

furthermore, the massless scalar equation on noncommutative m5-branes turns out

to be the same with the one on the ordinary m5 branes. therefore, the classical cross

sections corresponding to absorption of traceless metric perturbations polarized along

the 5-branes are identical for both type of branes.

note added for the hep-th version: after the submission of the present paper to

the net, we received [24] and [25], which also consider scalar absorption by noncommu-

tative d3-branes. in [24], the authors claim that to see eects of noncommutativity

one should consider waves propagating along noncommuting directions on the brane.

however, as discussed above, interpretation of this from a world volume theory point
of view is not clear. in [25], the authors claim that in the b  , i.e.   /2,
limit the noncommutativity eects are turned on, and in this limit the rr-scalar is

nonpropagating. but, as shown in [7], even in the presence of constant and nite b-

eld, noncommutativity in the eective eld theory is inevitable. on the other hand,
taking b   limit is a delicate issue. for instance, to make contact with string
theory, the parameter r should be xed as in (31) and thus diverges at  = /2.

to avoid such innities, one should scale other parameters in a suitable way and this

gives the geometry found in [9]. therefore, contrary what is claimed in [25], the ns

3-form and the rr 5-form eld strengths are not zero at  = /2 . beside that,

even for the solution in which ns 3-form and rr 5-form eld strengths are zero, one

can still introduce uctuations of these elds. in either case, it can be shown that

rr-scalar is not necessarily nonpropagating when  = /2.
