abstract

at high temperatures the a0 component of the yangmills eld plays the role of the
higgs eld, and the 1-loop potential v (a0) plays the role of the higgs potential. we
nd a new stable vortex solution of the abrikosovnielsenolesen type, and discuss
its properties and possible implications.

recently there has been renewed interest in the quantized z(nc) vortices as possible
candidates for the connement mechanism [1, 2, 3].
if vortices are physical objects (and
not lattice or gauge artifacts) playing a role in the dynamics of the vacuum uctuations
they have to be found as stable solutions of the eective action obtained from integrating
out high frequencies of the eld. in the zero-temperature case the one-loop eective action
for vortices has been introduced in our previous work [4]. the zero-derivative term of the
eective action, i.e. the potential energy of the vortex has been found in that paper:
it
does not lead to any stable solution. this is probably not surprising since all derivatives
of the eective action should be summed up before one gets to a denite conclusion on the
existence of vortex solutions.

in this letter we address a related but simpler question on whether there are stable
vortex solutions in the case of nonzero temperatures. moreover, we restrict ourselves to

a simple and more pure case of 2 + 1 dimensions.
if the temperature t is high enough
vortices can be viewed as cylinders pointing in the time direction, with a nontrivial prole
in the transverse spatial plane. we shall show that the abrikosovnielsenolesen-type
vortex solution indeed exists in this case, and we shall present its prole and energy per unit
length, as functions of temperature.

the 2 + 1-dimensional ym theory has a coupling constant g2

3 of the dimension of mass;
high temperatures means t  g2
3. one can always choose a gauge with the time component
of the ym eld aa
0(x) independent of time. in this gauge, one can integrate out the high-
momenta components of the elds to obtain the low-momenta eective action for time-
independent elds aa
(x),  = 0, 1, 2. the separation scale between high and low momenta
is given, naturally, by the temperature: high momenta means p > 2t . the eective action
is obtained by integrating over nonzero matsubara frequencies, n = 2nt, n > 0, and
over zero (n = 0) matsubara frequency but large spatial momenta.
it can be expanded
in powers of the spatial derivatives of the aa
(x) elds, divided by appropriate powers of
t . the zero-derivative term is the potential energy v (a0). since the spatial size of the
vortex solution is expected to be larger than 1/t one can neglect all terms of the derivative
expansion except the rst, zero-derivative term v (a0). the latter can be written as [5, 4]

notice that the potential energy (1) is nonanalytic at the minima  = integer. the fact
that the second derivative of v (a0) has a logarithmic singularity at  = integer is related to
the infrared divergency of the debye mass in 2 + 1 dimensions [6, 7], and will have important
consequences for the vortex solution.

where the constants e1, f1 are not determined by the equations. notice that the higgs eld
(x) approaches its asymptotic value at innity not as an exponent but as a gaussian. this
is a consequence of the logarithmic divergence of the debye mass in 2 + 1 dimensions. being
rewritten in original notations eq. (17) reads

we notice that the characteristic scale for the variation of a0(), namely 1/g3t , is, at high
temperatures, much larger than 1/t . it justies neglecting derivative terms of a0 in the
eective action and leaving only the zero-derivative term v (a0), as in eq. (2).

at   .

the coecients c1, d1, e1, f1 are determined by solving eqs. (10, 11) starting from the
expansion (14) towards larger values of x and starting from the asymptotic form (16,17)
towards smaller values of x, and matching the functions and their derivatives at some inter-
mediate point x  1; this is done numerically. the resulting prole functions (x) and (x)
are shown in fig.2, for two values of  = 0.15 and 0.5.
integrating the prole functions over the whole range of x we get the action of the vortex
svortex = e/t plotted in fig.3, as function of temperature t . at t  g2
3 the action is
large, so that the vortices are exponentially suppressed. this is a theoretically clean case:
as explained above, the use of the energy functional (2) for nding the vortex solution is
justied. the vortices are in fact short and broad cylinders oriented in the time direction.

indeed, the length of the cylinders is 1/t while the characteristic radius where the higgs

eld a0 reaches its asymptotic value 2t is of the order of 1/g3t  1/t , see eq. (17). it
should be mentioned, however, that the magnetic ux () reaches its asymptotic value of
1 at a smaller radius   1/t , see eq. (16).
to build the 2 + 1-dimensional vacuum at high temperatures out of the vortices, one
needs rst of all to gauge rotate the higgs eld aa
0 (4) to, say, the third direction in colour
space: one cannot add up vortices with dierent colour orientations of a0 at innity. this
is achieved with a help of a -dependent gauge transformation

under this gauge transformation the a0 component of the ym eld becomes proportional to
0 = a3 2t (). the gauge transformation (19) is, however, discontinuous at  = 2,
3, a a
therefore the azimuthal component a
 will now have a dirac-surface singularity at  = 0:

 = a2 1

[1  ()  2()] .

(20)

the wilson loop (5) is, naturally, preserved by this gauge transformation: it remains (1)2j
at    (for the representation labelled by spin j).

having oriented the higgs expectation value a0() in one colour direction it is now
possible to add up many vortices, each of them necessarily carrying a singular dirac surface.
apart from the factor exp(svortex) the statistical weight of a vortex is determined by the
uctuation determinant, in particular by the zero modes of the solution. we expect three
zero modes here, two of which are associated with the spatial position of the vortex center
zi, and one pure gauge cyclic mode associated with shifts in the time direction. (the latter
can be revealed if one uses a gauge with a0 explicitly dependent on time.)

denoting the (uncalculated) prefactor arising from the uctuation determinant and from

zero modes by (t, g3) we can write the vortex partition function as that of a gas,

zvortex = xn

1

n! (cid:18)z d2z  exp(svortex)(cid:19)n

,

(21)

implying that at large t vortices are dilute and thus neglecting their interactions. it follows
immediatelly from eq. (21) that the spatial density of vortices (i.e. number per unit area) is

at large t the numbers of noninteracting vortices inside any large area are poisson-distributed.
therefore, the average of large wilson loops can be calculated as

n =  exp(svortex).

(22)

hwji = xn h(1)2jin (n  area)n

enarea = ( e2narea at j = halfinteger,

at j = integer,

(23)

so that the string tension for half-integer representations is twice the vortex density [1], and
zero for integer represenations.

it should be recalled, however, that at t   the 2 + 1 dimensional system reduces to
3t , and in two dimensions there is a trivial

two dimensions with a coupling constant g2
perturbative connement with a nonzero string tension in any representation,

2 = g2

2 = g2

2 j(j + 1).

(24)

the above vortex-induced string tension should be thus regarded as an exponentially small
addition to eq. (24): it leads to a deviation from the casimir scaling of eq. (24). it would be
instructive to study the high-temperature 2+1 dimensional ym theory in lattice simulations,
if only because one can learn to identify physical vortices by comparing objects found from
maximal center gauge xing with the continuum proles presented here. such experience
might be useful in higher dimensions.

as one lowers t the vortex action decreases; at t  g2

3 the action becomes of the order
of unity, therefore, the vortices are not suppressed anymore. unfortunately, the quantitative
theory fails at this point: rst, because the eective action (2) is not accurate anymore,
second, because the vortices become long and start to bend, third, because one can hardly
neglect interactions between dense vortices. much more serious eorts are needed to describe
vortices in this case (if they exist). nevertheless, to our mind it is useful to know that at
least in the limit of high temperatures vortices do exist in a pure yangmills theory, and
their basic properties are established.
