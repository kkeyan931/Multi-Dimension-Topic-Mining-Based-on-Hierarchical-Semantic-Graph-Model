nielsenolesen vortices on the higgs branch of n = 2 supersymmetric
su(2) gauge theory with massive fundamental matter. higgs branch
represents a limiting case of superconductor of type i with vanishing
higgs mass. we show that in this limit vortices still exist although
they become logarithmically thick. because of this the conning po-
tential is not linear any longer. it behaves as l/ log l with a distance
l between conning heavy charges (monopoles). this new conning
regime can occur only in supersymmetric theories. we also address
the problem of quantum stability of vortices. to this end we develop
string representation for a vortex and use it to argue that vortices
remain stable.

1 introduction

supersymmetric gauge theories can be viewed as a theoretical laboratory
to develop insights in the dynamics of strongly coupled gauge theories like
qcd. revolutionary ideas of electromagnetic duality [1, 2] made it possible to
study traditionally untractable strongly coupled theories using weak coupling
description in terms of dual variables. particularly spectacular results were
obtained by seiberg and witten in n = 2 supersymmetry where the low
energy eective lagrangians were found exactly [2, 3].

one of the most important physical outcome of the seibergwitten the-
ory is the demonstration of u(1) connement via monopole condensation [2].
according to old mandelstam and thooft ideas [4] when monopoles condense
the electric ux is conned in the (dual) abrikosovnielsenolesen (ano)
vortex tubes [5] connecting heavy trial chargeanticharge pair. because this
vortex has a constant energy per length (string tension  ) the potential be-
tween charge and anticharge increases linearly with their separation. thus,
if monopoles (charges) condense then charges (monopoles) conne. the ef-
fective description of this phenomenon is given by the abelian higgs model.

the ratio of the higgs mass mh to the photon mass m in the abelian
higgs model is an important parameter characterizing the type of the super-
conductor. for mh > m we have type ii superconductor while for mh < mh
we have type i.

in the seiberg-witten theory this connement scenario is realized in two
possible ways. first, in pure gauge theory near monopole (dyon) singularity
upon breaking n = 2 supersymmetry to n = 1 one by adding the mass term
to the adjoint matter [2]. second, in n = 2 theory with fundamental matter
hypermultiplets on higgs branches [3].

consider the n = 2, su(2) gauge theory [2]. the gauge group is broken
down to u(1) by the expectation value hai = a3a of the adjoint scalar
eld a, a = 1, 2, 3. the complex parameter a parametrize the modular
space (coulomb branch) of the theory. near the monopole point on the
coulomb branch (the point, where monopole becomes massless) the eective
low energy theory is the dual n = 2 qed. this means that the theory has
light monopoles coupled to dual photon in the same way as ordinary charges
are coupled to the ordinary photon.

2

upon breaking n = 2 supersymmetry by the mass term for the adjoint
matter monopoles condense implying the u(1) connement for heavy trial
charges. the eective low energy theory is given by the abelian higgs model
with mh = m [6] (here mh is the mass of the monopole and m is the mass
of the dual photon). this condition means that the ano vortex saturate the
bogomolny bound [7] (see [8] for the relation between supersymmetry and
the bps bound) and the string tension  is given by

 = 2v2

(1.1)

at least for small masses of the adjoint matter. 1 here v is the vev of the
higgs eld.

the second option is the connement on higgs branches in the seiberg
witten theory.
if two (or more) avours of matter of the n = 2 su(2)
gauge theory with nf fundamental hypermultiplets have the same mass then
the higgs branch is developed with hqi 6= 0, where q is the matter hyper-
multiplet [3]. positions of roots of higgs branches on the coulomb branch
depend on the mass parameter m. the low energy theory near a given sin-
gularity (root) is n = 2 abelian higgs model, in which the role of the higgs
hypermultiplet is played by the state becoming massless in this singularity.

once charges (monopoles) condense on the higgs branch we expect monopoles

(charges) to conne [3, 9]. however, this scenario is much less understood,
than the rst one discussed above. the purpose of the present paper is to
study the mechanism of the connement on higgs branches via formation of
ano vortices. we consider the case of two hypermultiplets nf = 2 with the
common mass m for simplicity.

from the point of view of the low energy abelian higgs model the higgs
branch is a limiting case of the superconductor of type i with mh = 0. the
usual arena for studies of ano vortices is the opposite, so called london
limit of type ii superconductivity with mh  m. in the london limit the
string tension is given by

ii = 2v2 ln

mh
m

.

(1.2)

1it is argued in [9] that this string is not in fact the bps-saturated state (it does
not belong to the short multiplet) due to higher corrections in the mass of the adjoint
matter.

3

this result was obtained by abrikosov in 1957 and then rederived by nielsen
and olesen in the framework of the relativistic eld theory [5].

in this paper we study vortices in the limit mh = 0. classical vortex
solutions still exist for the type i superconductor [10] and we show that
they survive the limit mh = 0. however, their transverse size becomes
logarithmically large. as a result the string tension becomes suppressed as

 =

2v2
ln ml

,

(1.3)

where l is the length of the string (the distance between heavy monopole
and antimonopole).
in fact,  in (1.3) goes to zero for innite strings in
accordance with [11].

our result (1.3) means quite unusual behavior from the point of view
of connement. eq.(1.3) means that the conning potential between well
separated heavy sources (monopole and antimonopole in the case at hand)
is not linear in l any longer. it behaves as

v (l) = 2v2

l

ln ml

(1.4)

for large l.

this peculiar behavior is specic for supersymmetric gauge theories with
higgs branches (we dont have higgs branches with mh = 0 without super-
symmetry). the potential (1.4) is the order parameter which distinguish this
new connement phase from the ordinary connement phase with v (l)  l
or from other phases. the potential (1.4) gives rise to the following behavior
of the wilson loop produced by the innitely heavy monopole going along
the contour c. for the w d
 is the dual potential)
the obvious generalization of (1.4) gives

 (ad

c = p exp irc dxad
c = exp(

w d

22v2s

ln(m  2s/p ))

(1.5)

for large s and p , where s is the area spanned by the loop c and p is its
perimeter. for rectangular loops s = t l and p = 2(l + t ), where t is the
time interval. we see that (1.5) is dierent from the usual area law for the
wilson loop.

the paper is organized as follows. in sect.2 we review the higgs branches
in the nf = 2 seibergwitten theory and derive the low energy action on
the higgs branch. in sect.3 we study classical vortex solution and derive the
result (1.3). then in sect.4 we address the problem of quantum stability of
vortices. we develop string representation for the vortex and use it to argue
that vortices survive in the quantum theory. sect. 5 contains our conclusions.

2 review of higgs branches

in su(2) theory

let us introduce nf = 2 fundamental matter hypermultiplets in the n = 2
su(2) gauge theory. in terms of n = 1 superelds matter dependent part of
the microscopic action looks like

smatter =z d4xd2d2 (cid:20) qaev qa +

ev eqa(cid:21) +
qaa + meqaqa(cid:21) + c.c.

(2.1)

here qka, eqak are matter chiral elds, k = 1, 2 and a = 1, . . . , nf , while v is

the vector supereld. a is the adjoint chiral supereld (its scalar component
a develops vev a). thus we have 16 real matter degrees of freedom for
nf = 2.

consider rst the limit of large m, m  . then three singularities on
the coulomb branch are easy to understand. two of them correspond to
monopole and dyon singularities of the pure gauge theory. their positions
on the coulomb branch are given by [3]

um,d =  2m

i  a2/2.

2we use the pauli-villars regularization scheme for the normalization of , see [12].

the third singularity corresponds to the point where charge becomes

massless. let us decompose matter elds as

0(cid:19)k
qka = (cid:18)1

(2.3)

from the superpotential in (2.1) we see that the q+ becomes massless at

(2.4)
the singular point a = +2 m is gauge equivalent to the one in (2.4). in
terms of variable u (2.4) reads

a = 

2 m .

uc = m2 +

(2.5)

strictly speaking, we have 2 + nf = 4 singularities on the coulomb branch.
however two of them coincides for the case of two avors of matter with the
same mass.

the eective theory on the coulomb branch near charge singularity (2.4)

is given by n = 2 qed with light matter elds qa

the charge singularity (2.4),(2.5) is the root of the higgs branch [3]. to

follow from (2.1). d-term conditions are

eqs. (2.6),(2.7) have nontrivial solutions for nf  2. these solutions deter-
mines vevs for scalar components qka, eqak of elds qka, eqak. dropping
heavy components q according to decomposition (2.3) and introducing the
sur(2) doublet qf a as

q1a = qa

(2.8)

we can rewrite three real conditions in (2.6),(2.7) as

qap( a)p

f qf a = 0,

a = 1, 2, 3.

(2.9)

eq.(2.9) together with the condition (2.4) determines the higgs branch (man-
ifold with hqi 6= 0) which touches the coulomb branch at the point (2.4).

the low energy theory for boson elds near the root of the higgs branch

looks like

(2.10)

where trace is calculated over avor and sur(2) indices. here  =  
inea,  =  + inea, the electric charge ne = 1/2 for fundamental matter
elds.

this is an abelian higgs model with last interaction term coming from
the elimination of d and f terms. the qed coupling constant g2 is small
near the root of higgs branch (we specify its value later on). we include
8 real matter degrees of freedom qf a in the theory (2.10) according to the
identication (2.8). the rest of matter elds qa
a (another 8 real degrees
of freedom) acquire large mass 2m and can be dropped out. the eective
theory (2.10) is correct on the coulomb branch near the root of the higgs
branch (2.4) or on the higgs branch not far away from the origin hqi = 0.

, eq 

it is clear that the last term in (2.10) is zero on the elds q which satisfy
constraint (2.9). this means that moduli elds which develop vevs on the
higgs branch are massless, as it should be. the other elds acquire mass of
order hqqi1/2. it turns out that there are four real moduli elds q (out of 8)
which satisfy the constraint (2.9) [3]. they correspond to lowest components
of the one hypermultiplet.

we can parametrize them as

qf a(x) =

1
2

f a
 (x)ei(x) .

(2.11)

here (x),  = 1 . . . 4 are four real moduli elds. it is clear that elds (2.11)
solve (2.9). the common phase (x) in (2.11) is the u(1) gauge phase. once
hi = v 6= 0 on the higgs branch the u(1) group is broken and (x) is

7

eaten by the higgs mechanism. say, in the unitary gauge (x) = 0. in the
next section we consider vortex solution for the model (2.10). then (x) is
determined by the behavior of the gauge eld at the innity. substituting
(2.11) into (2.10) we get the bosonic part of the eective theory on the higgs
branch near the origin

shiggs

boson = z d4x( 1

 +  qq) ,

4g2 f 2

where

q(x) = (x) ei(x) .

(2.12)

(2.13)

once v 6= 0 we expect monopoles (they are heavy at m  ) to conne
via formation of vortices which carry the magnetic ux. in the rest of the pa-
per we study in detail vortex solutions in the model (2.12). as we mentioned
in the introduction this model corresponds to the type i superconductivity
with the vanishing higgs mass, mh = 0. the photon mass in the model
(2.12) is

m2

 =

g2v2

 .

(2.14)

note, that we do not introduce fayetilliopoulos term in the seiberg
witten theory. in the presence of such term there are bps-saturated vortices.
they correspond to special points on the modular space where vevs of
massless moduli elds hqi = 0, whereas other massive matter elds from
(2.10) develop vevs equal to fayetilliopoulos parameters with windings
at spatial innity [15, 9]. instead, vortices which arise in theories with at
higgs potential are not bps-saturated. they are discussed from the brane
point of view in [16] and from the eld theory point of view in [11].

 taking v2


if we increase v2

> 2 we can integrate out massive photon.
then the eective theory is a -model for massless elds q which belong to
4-dimensional hyperkahler manifold, r4/z2. the metric of this -model
is at [3, 13], there are, however, higher derivative corrections induced by
instantons [14]. in this paper we consider region of higgs branch with v2
 
. this determines the scale of the eective abelian higgs model (2.12).
w -bosons and other particles which reect the non-abelian structure of the

underlying microscopic theory are heavy with masses >  and can be ignored.

to conclude this section let us briey review what happens if we reduce
the mass parameter m. at m =  the charge singularity (root of the higgs
branch) collides with the monopole (dyon) singularity, see eqs.(2.2),(2.5).
these are argyresdouglas points [17, 18]. at these points mutually non--
local degrees of freedom (say, charges and monopoles) becomes massless si-
multaneously. these points are very interesting from the point of view of the
monopole connement on the higgs branch we study in this paper. mono-
poles become dynamical as we approach argyresdouglas point, m  .
we comment on the physics at this point at the end of the paper.

after the collision quantum numbers of particles at singularities change
because of monodromies [3]. if we denote quantum numbers as (nm, ne)b,
where nm and ne are magnetic and electric charges of the state, while b
is its baryon number then at m >  we have charge, monopole and dyon
singularities with quantum numbers

(0, 1/2)2
1

,

(1 0)0 ,

(1, 1)0 .

(2.15)

the superscript for the charge means that we have two avors of charges.
after charge singularity collides with monopole one (at m < ) the quantum
numbers of particles at singularities become [19]

(1, 0)2
0

,

(1, 1/2)1 ,

(1, 1/2)1 .

(2.16)

now monopole (1, 0)0 condense on the higgs branch which emerges from the
point (2.5), while dyons (1, 1/2)1 and (1, 1/2)1 conne because they carry
electric charge.3 at zero mass, m = 0 two dyon singularities in (2.16) coincide
(see (2.2)) and the second higgs branch appears at the point u = 1/2 2.
this restores the global symmetry from su(nf = 2) in the massive theory
to so(2nf = 4) at m = 0 [3].

3 vortex solution

in this section we construct the classical vortex solution for the model (2.12).
without loss of generality we can rotate vevs v in the r4 space to the
3throughout the rest of the paper to avoid confusion we refer to particles which develop
vevs on the higgs branch as charges and to states which conned as monopoles (dyons).
this terminology corresponds to masses of matter above argyresdouglas point m > .
at m <  one should change the terminology according to eqs. (2.15),(2.16).

conguration v = (v, 0, 0, 0). now we look for vortex solutions with q1 
q 6= 0 and q2 = q3 = q4 = 0. thus for the purpose of nding the classical
vortex solution we can drop elds q2, q3, q4 in (2.12) 4. doing so we arrive at
the standard abelian higgs model with one complex matter eld q  q1

sah = z d4x( 1

(3.1)

here we write down the double well potential term for the matter eld q with
coupling constant . we cannot introduce this term in the seibergwitten
theory without breaking down n = 2 supersymmetry. we use this term to
regularize the vortex solution and afterwards take the limit   0. in terms
of  the mass of the higgs eld reads

we consider the model (3.1) at

(3.2)

(3.3)

(see (2.14)) taking the limit mh  0 in the end. the limit (3.3) is the
opposite to the london one.

3.1 two dimensional problem

to begin with in this subsection we study innitely long ano vortex, with
length l  1/mh. in fact, this is not what we want. to take limit mh  0
we have to study not that long vortices. we focus on the opposite limit
l  1/mh in the next subsection.

for innitely long vortex the problem becomes two dimensional. assume
that solutions for q and a depend only on xi, i = 1, 2. let us use the
standard ansatz for elds q [7]

q(x) = (r) ei arg(xi) ,

where (r) is real, and for a

neai(x) = ij

xj
x2 [1  f (r)] ,

4we cannot ignore these massless elds in the quantum theory, however.

() = v ,
(0) = 0 ,

f (0) = 1 ,
f () = 0

(3.6)

(3.7)

and

for f (r).

the boundary conditions (3.7) for gauge eld ensures that the vortex
carry one unit of the magnetic ux. to see this let us calculate the dual eld
strength

f  = ijiaj =

(3.11)

(3.12)

now to solve these equations in the limit m  mh we adopt the following
model for the vortex. we assume that the electromagnetic eld of the vortex
is conned inside the core of radius rg (we nd rg later), such that f  = 0

11

at r  rg. instead scalar eld  is almost zero inside the core and grows
towards its vev  = v at the innity outside the core.

thus at zero order approximation we assume that  = 0 at r  rg. we
improve this approximation later on and show that corrections to  inside
the core do not aect the string energy in the logarithmic approximation.

if  = 0 inside the core we have from eq.(3.12) for gauge eld f

f (0) =

, r  rg
r  rg .

(3.13)

the superscript (0) means the zero order approximation. to this order the
magnetic eld is constant inside the core and zero outside, see (3.8).

now consider eq.(3.11) for (r) outside the core. taking into account
5 we nd that
(3.13) and neglecting the nonlinearity in (3.11) at large r
(3.11) reduces to the equation of motion of free eld with mass mh . we
have at r  rg

(3.14)
here k0 is a bessel function. it has exponential fall-o at innity k0(mhr) 
emh r and logarithmic behavior at small mh r:

(  v)  vk0(mhr) .

k0(mh r)  ln

mh r

.

(3.15)

we assume that rg  1/mh (we conrm this later) so k0(mh r) becomes
very large at r  rg. to match the solution (3.14) with the value  = 0
inside the core we have to normalize (3.14) properly. doing so we nally get
for the eld 

(0) = 

v 1 

0 ,
k0(mh r)

r  rg
ln(2/mhrg)! , r  rg.

(3.16)

5as soon as we are going to take the limit mh  0 the last term in (3.11) plays really
the role of a mass term which regularize the behavior of  at r   and the nonlinearity
associated with this term is not important.

12

substituting (3.13) and (3.16) into (3.10) we get the energy of vortex as a
function of rg

(3.17)

the rst term here comes from the electromagnetic energy inside the core
(see the rst term in (3.10)). the second term comes from the scalar eld
surface energy (the second term in(3.10)). all other terms are small in
powers of 1/ ln(mh rg). note, that the second term in (3.17) comes from
the logarithmic integration in the region rg  r  1/mh. this logarithm
in the numerator cancels one of two logarithms in the denominator (coming
from the normalization in (3.16)) giving the result (3.17).

minimizing (3.17) with respect to rg we nd

substituting this into (3.17) we get nally the vortex energy

(3.18)

(3.19)

we stress once again that the main contribution to the vortex energy (3.19)
comes from the logarithmic tail (3.16) of the scalar eld outside the core.

so far we have considered vortices with winding number n = 1. now it
is clear that to the leading order the vortex energy does not depend on n for
mh  m and is given by eq.(3.19).

we can calculate corrections to our zero order approximation vortex
(3.13),(3.16) in the intermediate region r  rg. for example, taking into
account (3.13) in eq.(3.11) we get the improved behavior for (r) inside the
core r < rg

(3.21)

it is easy to see, however, that these corrections do not aect the main con-
tribution to the energy of the vortex (3.19) in the logarithmic approximation.

now let us discuss the result (3.18),(3.19). if we formally take the limit
mh  0 then the vortex becomes innitely thick (rg  ) and its string
tension goes to zero. this result is in the accordance with results of ref.[11],
where it was noted that there are no vortices for the theories with at higgs
potential. the reason is that eld  has logarithmic behavior outside the
core and cannot approach its boundary condition  = v at innity. this can
be seen from (3.16). if we put the ir-regularization mh to zero in (3.16) then
k0(mh r) is given by (3.15) and  goes to innity instead of v at r  .

it is clear therefore, that the innitely long vortex does not exist at mh =
6 in the next subsection we consider vortices of the nite length l and

0
show that l plays the role of ir-regularization in the limit mh = 0.

3.2 three dimensional problem

now, we are going to consider long but not innitely long vortices 1/m 
l  1/mh. this will allow us to take the limit mh  0.

as we already mentioned before the main problem with the limit mh  0
is that in this limit the eld  outside the core obeys free eld equation (see
(3.11)). thus   ln r at large r and cannot approach its boundary value v
at r  .

however, it is clear that for the vortex of nite length l at |x|  l eld
 behaves as   v  1/|x|. thus it can reach its boundary value at innity.
let us consider the vortex of length l stretched in x3 direction between
static heavy monopole at the point x3 = l/2, x1 = x2 = 0 and antimonopole
at x3 = l/2, x1 = x2 = 0. more specically we consider the same ansatz
(3.4),(3.5) for elds q and a with winding phase (x) = arg(x1, x2) for
|x3|  l and  = 0 for |x3|  l. functions  and f now depend on
r2 = x2

1 + x2

2 and x3.

the electromagnetic eld is conned in the narrow tube of radius rg (we
determine rg later) which is stretched between monopole and antimonopole.

6see, however, the discussion of tensionless strings in the brane picture [20].

14

at rg  r  l. this region gives the main contribution to the energy.
minimizing the energy with respect to r0 we nd r0  l and the vortex
energy is still given by (3.25).

our results in (3.24), (3.25) show that the vortex length l really plays
the role of the ir-cuto. now we can safely put mh = 0. the radius of the
vortex remains nite and its energy nonzero.

the result in (3.25) means that monopoles are in the connement phase
on the higgs branch of the seibergwitten theory. however, the connement
potential is not linear in l. it shows weaker behavior l/ log l at large l.
this new connement phase is a specic one for supersymmetric theories
with higgs branches.

of course, results of this section are purely classical. in the next section
we address the problem of quantum stability of vortices on the higgs branch.

4 quantum stability of vortices

4.1 general considerations

in a given higgs vacuum with hqqi 6= 0 the stability of vortices is ensured by
the topology. vortices correspond to minimum energy congurations with a
given winding number n, which is an element of 1(u(1)) = z.

7

however, one might suspect that the presence of vortices can destabilize
the higgs branch causing the phase transition to the unbroken phase with
hqqi = 0. the reason for this is that in the theory with at higgs potential
there is no loss of volume energy associated with transition from the broken
phase with hqqi 6= 0 to the unbroken phase with hqqi = 0.

let us compare two congurations. first is the monopoleantimonopole
pair at large separation l in the higgs vacuum hqqi = v2 6= 0. the magnetic
ux of the monopole creates the vortex string connecting the monopole with
the antimonopole. the energy of this conguration is given by (3.25). sec-

7as we have shown in the last section the vortex energy does not depend on winding
number n in the limit mh = 0. thus vortex with winding number n has less energy than
n vortices with n = 1. we discuss this issue in the subsection 4.3.

16

ond, consider the same monopoleantimonopole pair in the unbroken vacuum
with hqqi = 0. the energy of this conguration associated with coulomb in-
teraction of monopole and antimonopole is

 

1
l

,

(4.1)

with possible logarithmic corrections coming from the renormalization of the
coupling constant.

comparing (3.25) and (4.1) at large l one can see that the monopole
antimonopole pair in the unbroken vacuum has less energy. therefore, one
may suspect that the presence of vortices induces the collapse of the higgs
branch with the phase transition to the coulomb branch with hqqi = 0.

now it is clear that the problem is whether the barrier of this transition
is nite or innite. we argue in this section that the barrier is in fact innite
and the higgs branch remains stable.

another possible way to understand our conclusion about the stability of
vortices we are going to make in this section is to note that the estimate (4.1)
is hardly correct. the point is that once the electric coupling constant
g2 is small then the magnetic one is large. this means that there are
uncontrollable corrections to the coulomb interactions of the monopole and
the antimonopole in (4.1).

of course, we cannot prove that the vortex is stable in the quantum theory
(still, we present some general arguments in subsection 4.3). however, in
this section we study several natural possibilities for the vortex to develop
instability and show that they do not lead to the collapse of the higgs branch.

first, imagine that the radius of the vortex rg grows and at large rg
the vortex becomes a bubble of the unbroken vacuum inside the broken one
(remember that q  0 inside the vortex core).

from (3.23) we see that the energy increases with rg as (log l/rg)1 at
rg  l. moreover, it is easy to estimate the surface energy of vortex if
rg  l. it goes as v2rg, thus innite rg means innite barrier.

another possibility is that we have many bubbles of nite size which
coalesce producing the unbroken vacuum. this means that we have many
strings on the higgs branch (they should be closed if monopoles are heavy).
we discuss this possibility in subsection 4.3.

17

in the next subsection we study one more possibility for the string to de-
velop instability. imagine that the string develops large uctuations actually
covering the whole space. this may lead to the transition to the unbroken
phase. to study this possibility we develop the string representation for the
vortex.

4.2 the string representation

in this subsection we are going to nd out if uctuations of vortex string
(deviation of vortex from a straight line) are controlled by any small param-
eter or not. to this end we develop string representation for the vortex. to
do this we follow the logic of refs.[21, 22], where the string representation
for vortex in the london limit (mh  m) has been developed. see also
recent paper [23] where the string representation for the case mh = m is
suggested.

to work out the string representation for the vortex we integrate out
photon multiplet and use m (r1
in (3.24), more exactly) as a uv-cuto
g
for our string theory. this leads to the -model for the real matter eld
(x) (see (3.4)) with the at metric and the constraint  = 0 on the string
worldsheet z() 8. we have for the partition function for the boson sector
of the theory

z = z d(x)dz()d()j() 

 exp(cid:26)z d4x(cid:20)()2 +z d2 (4)(x  z())i()(x)(cid:21)(cid:27) .

(4.2)

here we introduce eld () living on the string worldsheet as a lagrange
multiplier. the jacobian j() is dened by

j()z dz()y

((z)) = 1 .

(4.3)

the jacobian j() is important for the quantization of the string theory. as
it is argued in [24, 25] its role is to make the ano string critical in four

8we also ignore 2, 3 and 4 in (2.13) because they decouple from  = 1 to the

leading order.

18

dimensions. we do not work out j() here. it involves quantum corrections
in the coupling constant of the 2d -model, which appears to be small as we
show below.

writing down  = v +  and integrating over  in (4.2) we get the 2d

theory on the string worldsheet

z = z dzd exp(cid:26)z d2iv() +
[z()  z()]2) .

+ z d2d2

(4.4)

the theory in (4.4) is a non-local one. it contains all powers of derivatives
of z(). to work out the leading term in derivatives let us x the gauge

z0 = 1 ,

z3 = 2

(4.5)

and consider deviations from the at string surface zi, i = 1, 2 to be small.
we have

[z()  z()]2 = (  )2 + [(  )nnzi]2 +    ,

(4.6)

where n = 1, 2 runs over two coordinates in (4.5). substituting (4.6) into
(4.4) we get the integral

1

(2)2z d2(  )
(  )2 =

1
2

ln ml ,

(4.7)

where we use m as a uv-cuto and characteristic size (length) of the string
l as a ir-cuto. using (4.7) and integrating over  in (4.4) we get nally

z =z dz exp ( 2v2

ln ml(cid:20)t l +z d2

(nzi)2 +   (cid:21)) .

2

(4.8)

the string tension in (4.8) coincides with the one in (1.3) which we have
obtained in the last section solving classical equations of motion for the
vortex (see (3.25)).

the action in the exponent in (4.8) is the expansion of nambugoto

action

sstring = z d2g ,

19

(4.9)

where gmn = mznz is the induced metric and  is given by (1.3). cor-
rections to (4.9) include higher derivative terms like rigidity term [26] and so
on. however the expansion in derivatives hardly makes sense here because
for mh = 0 the length of the string by itself plays the role of a ir-cuto.

now let us see whether our string is stable or it can develop large uc-
tuations. to this end let us estimate the renormalized string tension. we
have

ren =

(4.10)

const

r2
g

where we use that the size of a core rg (3.24) plays the role of uv-cuto for
our string theory (4.9) ((4.4) more precisely).

now let us show that the second term in (4.10) is small as compared to
the rst one. its ratio to  plays the role of the eective coupling constant
in the 2d -model (4.9), (4.4)

g2
2d

.

(4.11)

to estimate (4.11) let us recall our general strategy. we start with the
microscopic non-abelian seibergwitten theory. then we integrate over

scales  >  and end up with eective n = 2 qed (see (2.12)) near the
root of the higgs branch. the qed description is valid at scales  in the
region m    . the qed coupling constant g2 is 1/g2   ln /qed,
where qed = m3/2 at m > . at the scale  = m the photon multiplet
decouples. thus the qed coupling in (4.11) is

g2  

1

ln(m/qed)

.

(4.12)

below the photon mass at   m we are left with the eective string theory
(4.4) with the coupling (4.11). we see that g2
2d  1. thus we conclude that
ano string on the higgs branch does not develop large uctuations.
it
represents almost straight line connecting monopole with antimonopole. its
string tension approximately given by its classical value  in (1.3).

it is worth noting that the rigidity term as well as higher corrections cause
an additional renormalization of the string tension in (4.10) [26]. still it is

20

known [27, 26] that a -model without -term has no ir-xed point and its
string tension remains nite.

this is usually considered as quite an unpleasant feature of the theory.
suppose we try to construct reasonable fundamental string theory starting
from, say, random surfaces on a lattice using lattice spacing as a uv-cuto.
then in order to get the string tension at some physical scale we need a xed
point for the 2d -model on the worldsheet. moreover, the string tension
should go to zero in lattice units in this xed point [27].

in this paper we follow quite a dierent logic. we consider a solitonic
ano string rather than the fundamental one. the uv-cuto for our string
theory (4.4) is the photon mass m (r1
g more precisely), which is already a
physical parameter. the nonzero string tension given by (1.3) ensures con-
nement for monopoles in the conventional setup of this problem. namely,
for well separated (l  rg) heavy monopoleantimonopole pair its interac-
tion potential (1.4) increased with l.

on the other hand, if we address the problem of calculating of the mass
spectrum of hadrons on the higgs branch then the string approach seems to
be not applicable at all.9 the reason for this is that the distance between

monopole and antimonopole in the meson is l0  1/ (at least for
small spins). thus l0  rg  1/m. at that short distances string is not
developed yet. we do not address problem of calculating of the hadron mass
spectrum in this paper.

let us note also, that because 1/ plays the role of the correlation
length for the normals on the surface, nonzero  means crumpled string
surface [26, 28]. this is of course true only for open strings connecting light
monopoles or for closed strings.

we considered only boson degrees of freedom of string in this subsection.
in principle, one should add fermions as well. however, we do not expect any
supersymmetry of our 2d -model (4.4) because our vortex is not bps state.
fermions produce additional renormalization of the string tension in (4.10)
which is of the same order 1/r2
g as the boson one. it is small as compared
with classical  and does not change our main conclusions.

9to address this problem with dynamical monopoles we have to go close to argyres

douglas point m =  or consider closed strings to be interpreted as glueballs.

21

4.3

interactions of vortices

now we are going to study one another possibility for vortices to develop
unstability and to destabilize the higgs branch. we know from the condensed
matter physics that vortices attract each other and coalesce producing the
unbroken vacuum in the type one superconductor. to clarify this issue we
now calculate interactions of vortices on the higgs branch.

to do this we use the string representation (4.4). suppose we have two
parallel vortices of length l at the separation r, r  l. then to the leading
order in g2
2d the contribution of these two vortices to the partition function
is

where z1(1), 1(1) and z2(2), 2(2) describes the rst and the second
vortex respectively. we neglect uctuations of vortices in (4.13) and x
the gauge (4.5) for each vortex. two rst terms in the exponent in (4.13)
correspond to each individual vortex while the third one describes their in-
teractions. performing the integral over (1  2) in (4.13) and integrating
out 1 and 2 we get for the vortex interaction potential

u1,2(r) = 22v2t l

ln l/r
(ln ml)2 .

(4.14)

the potential (4.14) shows the logarithmic attraction. it is clear that if we
consider the case r  l then the problem becomes three dimensional and
u1,2  1/r. note also, that the vortexantivortex interaction is the same
as the vortexvortex one in the limit mh = 0.

thus it is clear that vortices interact via attractive coulomb forces (u 
ln r if r  l and u  1/r if r  l). however, we know that the
coulomb gas with atraction is unstable. this means that if vortices condense
then they attract each other and coalesce destabilizing the higgs branch.

22

this is exactly what happens in the condensed matter superconductor when
the external magnetic eld exceeds its critical value.

to be more specic we can describe the interaction of the string with the

external higgs eld using eq.(4.2). it has the form

z d4xi(x)j(x),

(4.15)

where j(x) =r d2(4)(x  z())() is the string current. the condensa-

tion of strings means that j develops nonzero vev. from (4.15) we see that
this would destabilize the higgs branch.

thus it is clear that the problem is whether vortices condense or not.
now we are going to argue that vortices do not condense and the higgs
branch remains stable. first note, that open strings could condense only
if monopoles condense. however we know that monopoles do not condense
even at the argyresdouglas point (where they become massless) because
we have only one avor of monopoles and eqs.
(2.6) and (2.7) have no
solutions for monopoles. still this argument does not rule out the possibility
of condensation of closed strings.

the more general argument is based on n = 2 supersymmetry. from
(4.15) we expect that if vortices condense they would generate a superpoten-
tial

(4.16)

z d2 m0eqq ,

where m0 is proportional to < j >. note that the mass term is the only
superpotential for matter elds which is allowed by the n = 2 supersymmetry
( if gauge elds are absent, see, for example, review [29]). however, (4.16)
does not destabilize the higgs branch.
it just produce a shift in the bare
mass parameter m.

this argument has even more general nature. if vortices destabilize the
higgs branch we expect them to generate some superpotential on it. as
soon as no non-trivial superpotential is allowed without breaking n = 2
supersymmetry we conclude that the higgs branch is stable. this means
that vortices do survive in the quantum theory giving rise to the conning
potential (1.4) between heavy well separated monopoles on the higgs branch.

23

5 conclusions

in this paper we studied vortices on the higgs branch of the seibergwitten
model. we showed that vortices of nite length exist classically and produce
the conning potential (1.4) for heavy monopoles. this conning potential is
not linear in l and we can use wilson loop as an order parameter to distin-
guish this new conning phase specic for higgs branches in supersymmetric
theories.

then we studied the stability of vortices in the quantum theory. first,
we showed that vortices do not grow in their transverse size rg. second, we
studied vortices in the string representation and showed that ano strings
do not develop large uctuations and their string tension remains nonzero in
the quantum theory.

next we ruled out the possibility for vortices to condense and form the
coulomb gas with attraction which would destabilize the higgs branch. our
conclusion is that vortices survive in the quantum theory producing a new
type of conning phase for monopoles with the potential (1.4).

we have not addressed the problem of calculating of the hadron mass
spectrum on the higgs branch. as we have shown the string approach is
not acceptable for this purpose. still it is quite plausible to suggest on the
general grounds that the lightest monopoleantimonopole meson becomes
massless at the argyresdouglas point m = . to see the reason for this let
us recall that the root of a higgs branch at m =  corresponds to conformal
eld theory with non-trivial anomalous dimensions [18]. if all hadrons built
of monopoles are massive at this point we could integrate them out together
with photon multiplet at scales 2  hqqi. then we would get a -model for
charges q with the at metric (the higgs branch admits only unique hyper
kahler metric). then nothing prevents us from taking the limit hqqi  0, in
which we would get trivial xed point. this is correct for all values of mass
parameter except argyresdouglas points m = , where we should recover
non-trivial conformal eld theory.

the possible resolution of this puzzle is that there is a massless monopole
(dyon) meson at m = () (see also [14]). still the calculation of the
hadron mass spectrum on the higgs branch remains to be an open problem.
