abstract

the physical content of the integrable modication of super yang-
mills theory in ten dimensions put forward earlier (hep-th/9811108)
is investigated. to this end, group-algebraic methods are developed
which allow to derive the set of physical elds and their equations of
motion from the supereld expansion of the supercurl, systematically.
the lax representation underlying this system is based on a one
parameter set of light rays. its so(2, 1) covariance is made manifest
and acts by mobius transformations on the spectral parameter. after
appropriate dimensional reduction, this allows a consistent projection
of the spectrum to so(2, 1) singlets. we analyze in detail the system
after reduction to seven dimensions. it describes the interactions of
two so(7) vector elds  one being the original yang-mills vector
potential , and two antisymmetric so(7) tensor elds.

1 introduction.

recently, progress was made in applying exact integration methods to su-
persymmetric yang-mills theory in ten dimensions. the starting point were
the atness conditions in superspace which have been known for some time
to be equivalent to the eld equations [2, 3]. it was shown in [1], that there
exists an on-shell light cone gauge, where the superelds may be entirely
expressed in terms of a scalar supereld satisfying two sets of equations. the
rst is linear and a general solution was derived [1]; the second is similar to
yangs equations and has been handled by methods similar to earlier studies
of self-dual yang-mills in four dimensions. a general class of exact solutions3
has been obtained [1] and a backlund transformation put forward [6].

so far, however,

it has not been possible to simultaneously solve the
two sets of equations. only a particular class of solutions of the yang type
equations has been found, which is not general enough to solve the other
(linear) set. returning to a general gauge, one may see that deriving the
scalar supereld satisfying the linear subset of equations is equivalent [6]
to solving a particular symmetrized form of the atness conditions. this
symmetrized form was shown to be explicitly integrable directly, since it
arises [4, 5] as compatibility condition of a lax representation, similar to the
one of belavin and zakharov [7], which may be handled by the same powerful
techniques as in the case of self-dual yang-mills in four dimensions.

the original lax representation [3] is formulated for light-like rays in
ten dimensions, which play the role of spectral parameters. as such, this
representation has not been very useful in practice, and the recent progress
corresponds to retaining only a subset of the atness conditions  and hence
to modify the dynamics  in such a way that the techniques of [7] become
applicable.

concretely, we consider a subset of lax equations with just a single spec-
tral parameter. geometrically, this corresponds to restricting the lax con-
nection to a one parameter set of light rays.
in section 3, this aspect is
analyzed in more detail. the simplest non-trivial situation corresponds to a
one parameter family of light rays whose spatial components vary in a xed
plane. we show that, with a particular choice (the {x9, x8}plane in our

3keeping, however, only the dependence upon one time and one space coordinates in
contrast with the dimensional reduction which will be discussed below. this is probably
not essential.

3

conventions), this gives back the symmetrized atness conditions mentioned
above. in this paper, we study the physical content of the integrable system
associated with this particular choice of plane.

to this end, we employ an important new ingredient, namely, the co-
variance of this lax pair under the so(2, 1) subgroup that acts in the
{x0, x9, x8}plane, provided that the spectral parameter simultaneously un-
dergoes a mobius transformation. thus, the breaking of the original lorentz
invariance in ten dimensions, which is the key point of the present approach
corresponds to so(9, 1)  so(2, 1)  so(7). for weyl-majorana spinors,
this leads to the separation

16  8 + 8 ,

(1.1)

(where the r.h.s. denotes a pair of so(7) spinor representations which form a
doublet under the so(2, 1)). this is instrumental in dening the involution
which is the key to applying methods modeled over the self-duality require-
ment in four dimensions; here, it involves the exchange of the two spinor
representations. at the end of section 3, we show, how the so(2, 1) covari-
ance of the lax representations allows to consistently truncate the spectrum
of physical elds described by our modied yang-mills dynamics, by retain-
ing singlets only. eectively, this corresponds to a dimensional reduction to
seven dimensions.

in the rest of the paper we temporarily forget about the lax representa-
tion, and concentrate upon deriving the eld content and dynamical equa-
tions contained in the symmetrized atness conditions. in general, the su-
perspace lax representations are such that the dynamical equations appear
as conditions on the fermionic components of the eld strength. this is true
for the original ten-dimensional yang-mills equations (equivalent to vanish-
ing of the full supercurvature), as well as in our case. since the symmetrized
atness conditions are weaker than the full ones, we eectively go partially
o-shell.
in particular, this gives rise to the appearance of more physical
elds appearing in the supereld components and a modication of the dy-
namics. at this point, it is worth recalling that, in the standard treatment [8],
the method used to eliminate the unphysical components of the superelds
makes an essential use of the equations of motion. it is thus not applicable
to our case. the main aim of the remaining part of present work is to devise
a more direct and general method, which is also applicable to our modied
equations.

4

section 4 is devoted to a systematic study of the expansion of the super-
eld equations in powers of the odd variables . we derive recursion relations
with an interesting structure. the elimination of unphysical components of
superelds is done recursively and involves two operators noted s and t .
the rst satises a simple quadratic equation while the second is nilpotent.
thus our equations bear some analogy with the descent equations [9].
in
this approach, the eld equations are enforced by further applying a projec-
tor k, and we thus study the interplay between s, t , and k on general
ground. applying this method to the symmetrized atness conditions, in
section 5, we explicitly identify the physical eld content, in the case where
no fermionic elds are present. section 6 then is devoted to deriving the
eld equations. to a large extent, we concentrate upon the case of so(2, 1)
singlets, for which the eld spectrum is shown to be still remarkably simple.
some concluding remarks are given at the end.

2 supereld conventions.

the notations are essentially the same as in the previous references. the
physical elds are noted as follows: xa(x) is the vector potential, (x) is the
majorana-weyl spinor. both are matrices in the adjoint representation of the
gauge group g. latin indices a = 0, . . . , 9 describe minkowski components,
greek indices  = 1, . . . , 16 denote spinor components. we use the dirac
matrices

a =

we will use the superspace formulation with 16 odd coordinates . the
general supereld expansions of a supereld  (x, ) may be written as

(x, ) =

[p](x, )

such that

[d , d ]+ = 2 (a) a .

(2.4)

the odd super vector potential, valued in the adjoint representation of the
gauge group, is denoted by a (x, ). we dene its supercurvature as

f  da + da + [a, a]+ + 2 (a) aa ,

restricts the freedom (2.7) to ordinary gauge freedom, i.e. to gauge parame-
ters g with [r, g] = 0. it has been shown [2, 3, 8] that the transverse gauge
condition together with the atness conditions

(2.11)

4in the terminology of [10], we have hence resolved the conventional constraint

(a)f = 0.

in particular, the zero order components of these superelds

xa  a[0]
a ,

   [0] ,

(2.12)

satisfy the yang-mills eld equations . moreover, (2.9) together with (2.8)
gives a unique recurrent prescription of the higher order supereld compo-
nents in aa,  and a as functions of the zero order contributions, i.e. as
functions of the physical elds.

3 the geometry of atness conditions.

recall next that the atness conditions (2.9) have a lax type representation
in superspace [3]. they imply the existence of a g-valued supereld [] for
any light-like ten-dimensional vector , which is dened by the linear system

a (a) {d + a} [] = 0 ,

a {a  aa} [] = 0 .

(3.1)

(3.2)

in turn, the compatibility conditions of (3.1), (3.2) imply (2.9). clearly, these
equations are invariant under multiplication by an overall constant, so that
 only depends upon the light-like ray considered.

3.1 a particular representation

an essential step will be to break the so(9, 1) of the original theory. we
do so in a particular way, where  as a matter of choice  the coordinates
{x0, x9, x8} play a special role. then the simplest formulae will result from
the following particular realization of -matrices:

088

(cid:16)(cid:0)9(cid:1)(cid:17) = (cid:16)(cid:0)9(cid:1)(cid:17) = (cid:18) 188 088
188 (cid:19) ,
088 188 (cid:19) ,
(cid:16)(cid:0)0(cid:1)(cid:17) = (cid:16)(cid:0)0(cid:1)(cid:17) =(cid:18) 188 088
(cid:16)(cid:0)i(cid:1)(cid:17) = (cid:16)(cid:0)i(cid:1)(cid:17) =(cid:18)

i, j = 1, . . . , 8.

i = 1, . . . 8 ,

our index convention is as follows: greek letters from the beginning of the
alphabet run from 1 to 16, letters from the middle of the alphabet from 1
to 8, denoting the two spinor representations of so(8). likewise, roman
indices from the beginning of the alphabet run from 0 to 9 whereas roman
indices from the middle of alphabet range between 1 and 8 (later on between
1 and 7):

using these explicit realizations the atness conditions (2.9) take the form

da + da + [a, a]+ = 2 (a0 + a9) ,
da + da + [a, a]+ = 2 (a0  a9) ,

(3.5)

equations (3.1), (3.2) may be considered as a lax representation of the
eld equations (2.10) where  plays the role of the spectral parameter. as
they stand, however, they are not very useful in practice. in the present ap-
proach, one weakens the atness conditions such that they become derivable
from a lax representation where the spectral parameter is a number  instead
of a light ray, and methods inspired from ref.[7] become applicable. starting
from equations (3.1), (3.2), this geometrically corresponds to keeping only
the atness conditions associated with a particular one parameter set () of
light-like rays. let us discuss such curves on the light cone systematically.
first, it is clear that their space part ~() cannot point in a xed direction,
since otherwise the corresponding light ray would not depend upon  and
the scalar spectral parameter would drop out, completely. the simplest non
trivial case hence is, to assume that the space part ~() describes a planar
curve.

the set of atness conditions equivalent to the full yang-mills equations
may then be obtained as follows. assuming that 9 6= 0, we may rescale  so

i=1 2

thatp8

 = i

i = 1, and introduce the following complex parametrization

1  
1  

,

i = vi ,

for

i = 1, . . . , 8 ,

  0  9 ,

(3.6)

with an eight-dimensional unit vector vi. with the explicit realization (3.3)
one then obtains the following form of the linear system

 + b~v

~v
 = d  i~v  ~d ,

b~v

 = a + i~v  ~a , b

~v
 = a  i~v  ~a .

(3.8)

(3.9)

one may verify, that the full atness conditions (3.5) on the supereld a
are recovered as follows. choose a set of eight vectors ~v(k) such that vi
(k) = i
k,
i, k = 1,    , 8. then, imposing the set of compatibility equations

[, ~v] = 0

for all ,  and unit vectors ~v(k), is equivalent to (3.5).

for each xed ~v, the linear system (3.7), (3.8) is similar to the one pro-
posed by belavin and zakharov for four-dimensional self-dual yang-mills the-
ory [7]. the role of the involution which in that case describes self-duality
is played by exchanging the two so(8) spinor representations by means of
~v  ~, here. these equations are straightforward generalizations of the ones
already proposed [4] (which correspond to choosing ~v = ~v(8) along the eighth
direction). in general, for a given choice of ~v, the system (3.7), (3.8) may
be solved starting from an ansatz which is meromorphic in . this leads to
purely algebraic equations  coming from the fact that the bracket in equa-
tion (3.7) is linear in   which may be solved in essentially the same way
as was done for self-dual yang-mills. it seems however impossible to carry
out the next step and solve the system for all ~v, which would really give a
solution of the full yang-mills equations in ten dimensions. indeed, equation
(3.9) implies that the bracket in (3.7) should be linear in ~v.~, a very strong
requirement, which to satisfy there seems to exists no systematic method.

3.2

integrable subsector

we thus stick to the earlier proposal to consider the integrable system ob-
tained by solving (3.7) for a particular choice of ~v. with vi = i
8, it is
convenient to choose (8) = . it then follows from the dirac algebra
(3.4) that the matrices i, i = 1, . . . , 7 are antisymmetric. from now on, ro-
man indices i, j, . . . from the middle of the alphabet will exclusively denote
the coordinates 1, . . . , 7.

9

the truncation vi = i

8 gives back the lax equations with scalar spectral

parameter , proposed earlier [5]:

d[] = d [] = 0 ,

(3.10)

with

d   + b + ( + b) ,

d  (1)2 (+ +a+)  (1+)2( +a) + i (21) (8+a8) ,

 = d + id ,  = d  id ,

b = a + ia , b = a  ia .

this lax connection satises the algebra

[ d , d ]+ = (1+)2 f  (1)2 f + i(12) (f + f)  4 d ,

[ d , d ] = (1+)3 f  i (1)3 f+  (1)2(1+) (f8 + f+) +

+ i (1+)2(1) (f8 + f) .

the integrability conditions implied by this lax connection thus are

f = f = f + f = 0,

(3.11)

f = f+ = f8 + f = f8 + f+ = 0 ,

where the second line is a consequence of the rst line and the denitions
(2.6), (2.11). the constraints (3.11) on the supercurvature are a symmetrized
version of (3.5). it was shown earlier [1, 4, 5, 6] that techniques similar to the
ones developed for self-dual yang-mills in four dimensions are at work. thus,
we nd a system of superspace constraints which is completely integrable. in
terms of the physical elds encoded in the supereld components this means
that going (partially) o-shell, we nd completely integrable dynamical equa-
tions. this dynamical content of the integrable superspace constraints has
to be extracted in the following.

10

3.3 the so(2, 1) covariance.

it is useful to display the full symmetry of the lax representation (3.10). to
this end, we recall that its origin was the truncation of (3.1), (3.2) to light-like
vectors in the {x0, x9, x8}plane. with the explicit realization (3.3), these
vectors may be written up to an overall factor as

aa  (cid:18) y  188

188

188

y1  188 (cid:19)  (y) ,

with y = i

1  
1 + 

,

clearly, any lorentz transformation in the {x0, x9, x8} plane is realized, up
to an overall factor by a change in y. explicitly, to rst order we have

(y + ) = (cid:0)1 + (cid:0)1  y1(cid:1)(cid:1) (y) +  {+(y) + (y)} ,

(y(1 + )) = (y) +  [3, (y)]+ ,
(y  y2) = (1 + (1  y)) (y) +  {(y) + (y)+} ,

where  denote the usual pauli matrices. thus, the so(2, 1) transformations
are realized by mobius transformations on y. let us summarize the last
equations as

(y + ky) = (1 + fk) (y) + (cid:0)j t

k (y) + (y)jk(cid:1) ,

where by (1, 0, 1), we denote the generators of so(2, 1), fk is a number
and the jk are 2 by 2 matrices, implementing the vector representation of
so(2, 1) on (y). consider the lax representation (3.10). it may be written
equivalently as

(3.12)

 (y) (d + a)  (y) = 0,

where (d + a)  is considered as a two-component vector. the situation now
simplies strongly under dimensional reduction. dropping the dependence
on the space-time variables in an appropriate way, it is straightforward to
deduce from equations (3.12) that

(y) {d + a ( + k) + jka}  (y + ky,  + k) = 0,

(3.13)

with k = jk. more precisely, dropping the dependence on the coordinates
x yields the covariance (3.13) for k = 0, whereas further dropping the de-
pendence on x8 ensures (3.13) for all three values of k. in both cases, this
implies invariance of the system under

ka = jka + (jk)

 a ,

k = (ky) y + (jk)

  .

(3.14)

for the corresponding values of k.

11

3.4 reduction of the dynamics to singlets.

the basic problem of weakening the eld equations  i.e. going at least par-
tially o-shell  is, that one encounters a plethora of additional physical
elds with complicated tensorial structures. the present so(2, 1) covariance
provides a way to organize the spectrum. in particular, upon dimensional
reduction to eight and seven dimensions, respectively, we may consistently
truncate the spectrum employing the invariance (3.14), discussed above. the
crucial point is, that the transformation of y may be algebraically realized
on the level of the solution  of the lax representation, once we assume that
 is meromorphic in y.

3.4.1 the 8d reduction

let us drop the dependence on the coordinates x and further assume that
0a = 0. this corresponds to truncating the spectrum to elds with vanish-
ing z-component of the so(2, 1) spin. it follows from the above discussion
that [] and (1 + 0) [] are both solution of the lax equations. we may
hence consistently impose

where 0 acts according to (3.14). more precisely, this condition reads

0 [] = 0 ,

(3.15)

(3.16)

(3.17)

and thus implies the following decomposition of the solution of the lax pair

(cid:8)   + (12)(cid:9) [] = 0,
1 + (cid:19)r
pxr=p(cid:18)1  
16xp=0
(cid:8)  (cid:9) [p,r](x, ) = r [p,r](x, ) ,

[p,r](x, ) ,

[] =

with

3.4.2 the 7d reduction

further assuming no coordinate dependence upon x8, as well as 1a = 0,
the solution of the lax representation (3.10) then likewise reduces to a singlet

k [] = 0 ,

for k = 1, 0, 1 .

(3.18)

12

this implies the decomposition

[] =

with

[p,r](x, ) ,

pxr=p(cid:18)1  
1 + (cid:19)r
16xp=0
(cid:8)  (cid:9) [p,r](x, ) = r [p,r](x, ) ,
(cid:8)(cid:9) [p,r](x, ) = [p,r+1](x, ) ,

{} [p,r](x, ) = [p,r1](x, ) .

(3.19)

this shows e.g. that the condition of absence of higher order poles in
the spectral parameter  which is the starting point in the derivation of
the instanton solutions of four-dimensional selfdual yang-mills theory [7] 
immediately implies truncation of the supereld expansion of  and further-
more induce certain algebraic relations on the highest order components of
. both equations (3.17), and (3.19) are compatible with the meromorphic
ansatz in  which is instrumental in the integration technique of [7]. of
course there remains to show that equations (3.10) do have solutions of the
form (3.17) or (3.19). we leave this problem for the future, and concentrate
in the following upon deriving the dynamical content of the modied eld
equations. the presented discussion shows, that with the appropriate dimen-
sional reduction, the entire analysis may be consistently reduced to so(2, 1)
singlets.

4 systematics of the supercurl expansion.

the level structure of the superelds has been discussed in detail in [8] (and
likewise in [11] for the reduction to n = 3 supersymmetric yang-mills theory
in four dimensions). however, this discussion makes an essential use of the
yang-mills eld equations, and thus does not apply to our case. the main
purpose of the present paper is to present an alternative method. as central
object we consider the modied supercurvature or supercurl

m  da + da + [a, a]+ ,

(4.1)

13

which transforms non-covariantly under the gauge transformations (2.7). it
contains the super eld strength f as gauge covariant part

f = m

16

(a) (a) m .

note, that the last relation is not invertible. for later convenience we in-
troduce the general space of superelds symmetric in two additional spinor
indices () which we denote by m. this space carries the grading (2.2):

m =

m[p] 

16mp=0

16mp=0(cid:8)v(),[1...p] 1 . . . p(cid:9) .

(4.2)

these superelds have the general decomposition according to (1616)s =
10+126:

m = 2 (a) aa + 1

5! (a1,...a5) ba1...a5 ,

(4.3)

with selfdual ba1...a5 =  1

5! a1...a10 ba6...a10 .

4.1 algebraic structure of the transverse gauge condi-

tion

if we do not impose any constraint on the superelds, we simply have to
take into account the fact that the gauge freedom (2.7) has been xed by
the transverse gauge condition (2.8) to gauge parameters which do not have
higher order supereld components. for the components of the super vector
potential this implies

a = 0



a[p]

[,1...p] = 0 ,

(4.4)

which is still invariant under ordinary gauge transformations.

this shows that the independent components in the supereld a are
given by the following sum of young tableaux5 for the spinor representation
16 of so(9, 1)

5here, and in the following,

the notion of young tableaux always refers to
(anti)symmetrizing the factors of a tensor product v n of a given representation v ,
i.e. always to the young tableaux of the corresponding permutation group sn .

4.1.1 recurrence relations

since later on we are going to study the eld equations implied by further con-
straining the supercurl m, we rst identify the remaining independent eld
components in m after imposing the transverse gauge condition. equation
(4.4) yields

(1 + r) a = m

using (4.6) we may then re-express this relation entirely in terms of m. it
is convenient to write it in the form

(s + r) m +

t m = c ,

(4.7)

where we have introduced two linear operators on the set of symmetric su-
perelds, by (sm) = s

(4.10)

note, that the operator s commutes with r whereas t raises the level
by 2. thus, (4.7) indeed builds a recursive system, relating the higher levels
of m to the image of the lower ones under t .

4.1.2 algebraic properties of s and t

by explicit computation one veries that the operator s satises the equation

(s  2) (s + r) = 0

(4.11)

thus, at a given level r = p, the operator s has only two dierent eigenval-
ues. we may hence decompose m into the eigenspaces of s:

m = m+ + m ,

(s + r) m+ = 0 ,

(s  2) m = 0 .

(4.12)

with (4.8) one nds that (s  2) and (s + r) are the projectors onto the
following young tableaux

p+1

...



m+ [p]

(4.13)

m [p]

moreover, one may verify the algebraic relations

t 2 = 0 ,

(s  2) t = 0 = t (s + r) ;

(4.14)

(4.15)

16

i.e. the level raising operator t is nilpotent and acts nontrivially only between
m+ and m:

t : m+ [p]  m [p+2] .

(4.16)
the non linear terms of the eld equations (4.7) are lumped into c. in the
weak eld approximation the right hand side of this equation is negligible.
since t is nilpotent, there is then an interesting analogy between equation
(4.7) and the descent equations [9]. however, these involve in general two
nilpotent operators, whereas in our case s satises equation (4.11) instead
of being nilpotent.

4.1.3 general solution

let us separate the two eigenvalues of s in equation (4.7) according to (4.12).
it is easy to verify that c+ = 0. thus one gets

t m  = 0,

rm  + t m + = c.

the rst relation is automatically satised because of (4.15). in conclusion,
m + is arbitrary, and

m  = r1(cid:0)c  t m +(cid:1)

(4.17)

(4.18)

thus, m + contains the independent components in m left over by the
gauge xing (4.4). comparing the young tableaux (4.13) to (4.5) we hence
recover the independent components identied in the vector potential a
after imposing the transverse gauge. the total and the independent number
of components of m [p] are respectively given by

p(cid:19),
dim m[p] = 136(cid:18)16

p + 2(cid:19).
dim m+ [p] = (p + 1)(cid:18) 17

we give a computation of these numbers in appendix a. altogether, m
contains 983041 independent components. since the gauge xing (4.4) is
dened by covariant constraints on the supereld, these components are nec-
essarily expressible in terms of representations of the supersymmetry algebra
(2.4). of course, supersymmetry is not realized level by level. decomposing
m + into so(9) multiplets, we nd the following structure

xp

m +[p] = 983041

(4.19)

= 1 + (44 + 84 + 128)  (9 + 16 + 36 + 126 + 128 + 231 +

+ 432 + 576 + 594 + 768 + 924) .

17

the 256 = (44 + 84 + 128) corresponds precisely to the smallest irreducible
o-shell multiplet of the 10d supersymmetry algebra (2.4) [12]. consistently,
m + forms a multiple of this multiplet. the additional singlet in (4.19) cor-
responds to the fact that we have not xed the ordinary gauge invariance.

4.1.4 dual space

for future use, let us recall that we can introduce the dual space mdual of
superelds by means of the bilinear form

hf |gi =z d x ef  (x, ) g (x, )

|gi  m ,

hf |  mdual ,

where

(4.20)

1p =

ef [p] 

1

(16  p)! xp+1,,16

116 f [16p]  , p+116

breaking the o(9, 1) invariance, one may identify m and mdual by means of
0
, for example. with respect to the decomposition so(9, 1)  so(2, 1) 
so(7), the bilinear form (4.20) then yields an so(7) invariant scalar product
on m, on which the so(2, 1) generators act as

ad
0 = 0 ,

ad
1 = 1 .

we are going to use this scalar product in the subsequent analysis of the
supereld constraint (3.11). note nally, that with respect to this scalar
product the operator s from (4.8) is self-adjoint

sad = s .

(4.21)

4.2 the dynamical constraint

so far, we have restricted the supercurl m only by the transverse gauge
condition (4.4), thereby restricting the gauge freedom (2.7). as mentioned
earlier, the dynamical equations follow from imposing further linear con-
straints on m. we collect these into a projector k, k 2 = k, such that
m is subject to

(i  k)

 m = 0 .

(4.22)

18

this denes a decomposition of the superelds in m into

m = mk + m ,

with

(i k) mk = 0, km = 0 .

(4.23)

the role of k is twofold. first, it further restricts the eld content in the su-
pereld m by certain algebraic relations; secondly, it implies eld equations
for the independent supereld components.

for example, the ordinary supersymmetric yang-mills equations which

are equivalent to the constraint (2.9) correspond to the choice k  kym

k 

ym  =

1
16

(a) (a)

.

(4.24)

in terms of the decomposition (4.3) this corresponds to setting b  0:

f = 0  ba1...a5 = 0

(4.25)

i.e. for m : 10+126 7 10 .

at level zero, this constraint correctly selects the physical gauge potential
a[0]
m as independent components (cf. (2.12)). at level p = 4 the condition
(4.22) then implies the yang-mills eld equations for a[0]
m .

under so(2, 1)  so(7), the eld b decomposes as 126  (1, 21) +

(3, 35). the symmetrized constraint (3.11) corresponds to imposing

b+ijkl = 0
bijkl = 0
b8ijkl = 0

,

(4.26)

f = 0
f = 0
f + f = 0

i.e. for m :

the non vanishing components of b in this case are

(4.28)

this is a self-adjoint operator w.r.t. to the scalar product introduced in sec-
tion 4.1.4 above, i.e. k = k ad.

evidently, in addition to the ym vector potential we hence nd an anti-
symmetric so(7) tensor eld in the zero order component of the supercurl
m. it is however not at all obvious which additional eld content we have
to expect in the higher order supereld components of m (which with
(4.25) were uniquely dened in terms of the lowest level (2.12) and thus left
no space for additional elds). nor is it clear a priori which type of eld
equations  if any  the weaker form of the superspace constraint implies.
this is, what we are going to address in the following.

we will refer to (4.24) and (4.28) as the strong and the weak dynamical

constraint, respectively.

4.2.1 field content

to identify the physical eld content among the components of the supercurl
m, we collect the constraints that have been imposed on m. these are
given by the transverse gauge expressed by (4.7) and the weak constraint
(4.22), (4.28):

(s + r) m = 

r + 2

r

(i  k) m = 0 .

t m + c ,

(4.29)

this obviously leaves

m+

k  mk  m+ = ker (i k)  ker (s + r) ,

(4.30)

undetermined. the independent (or physical) supereld components in m
are hence given by m+
k , the space of eigenvectors of the operator ksk with
eigenvalue p. the remaining part of m is consequently determined by
the system (4.29) in terms of derivatives and nonlinear combinations of the
physical elds. the fact that this part is in fact overdetermined by (4.29)
then in turn implies the eld equations as we shall discuss now.

4.2.2 field equations

the dynamical equations arise from combining the two equations of (4.29)
into

(s + r) m [p]

k +

t m [p2]

k

= c[p] .

vectors hz| such that

in terms of the lower levels unless we project out onto

hz| (s + r) m [p]

k = 0 = hz| (s + r) km [p] ,

in which case (4.29) implies a restriction on the image of t . we may take
hz| = hz|, and obtain

hz|k = 0

thus, the relevant vectors hz| are simultaneous eigenvectors of k ad with
zero eigenvalue and of sad with eigenvalue 2; we denote them as hz
|. these

are eigenvectors of(cid:0)i k ad(cid:1) sad(cid:0)i k ad(cid:1) with eigenvalue 2. (as discussed

above, for the weak superspace constraint we nd that s and k are self-
adjoint w.r.t. the scalar product induced by (4.20).) for any such eigenvector
hz

(4.32)

where the numbers on the l.h.s. can simply be extracted from the representa-
tion tables of so(9, 1) and so(7), respectively. for the lowest levels, these
tables are collected in appendix b.

5 the physical eld content.

here, we will determine the eld content which is induced by the weak dy-
namical constraint (4.28). for simplicity, we restrict for the rest of the paper
to purely bosonic congurations, e.g. we set all fermionic elds to zero. this

21

is just for the sake of clarity, the techniques may likewise be applied to deter-
mine the structure of the fermionic elds and eld equations. in particular,
supersymmetry is unbroken up to this point.

we recall, that with the strong superspace constraint (4.24), the arbitrari-
ness in the supercurl m is restricted to the level p = 0, i.e. all higher levels
are determined. by analyzing the bianchi identities for the supercurvature
one veries that in this case the following supereld relation holds [8]

r(r+1) m = 1

2 (a) (a

bc)12 12 fbc ,

(5.1)

where

fab = aab  bab + [aa, ab] ,

is now the curvature of the supereld aa. together with (4.6), one hence
obtains recurrence relations which completely determine m in terms of its
lowest components  the physical elds xa.

with the weak dynamical constraint (4.28) the situation becomes essen-
tially more complicated. in particular, more elds have to be introduced to
eventually obtain closed recurrence relations which would replace (5.1). in
this section we take the rst step and analyze the physical eld content in
the supereld m as implied by the weak dynamical constraint.

to keep things tractable, we will most of the time restrict the analysis
to those elds which transform as singlets under the so(2, 1) symmetry
underlying (3.10). as we have shown in section 3, this is consistent truncation
of the system to seven dimensions. in this spin 0 sector we can determine the
complete eld content. in addition to the yang-mills elds, we nd certain
additional vector and antisymmetric tensor elds, collected in (5.26), below.
despite the technical restriction to so(2, 1) singlets, the method described
in the following allows straight-forward although more tedious generalization
to the higher spin elds.

according to the general discussion above, the independent components
k , i.e. by the intersection of

in the supercurl m are given by the space m+
the kernels of (s +r) and (i k). we start from (4.32)

dim m+

k = dim m+  dim m + dim m
 ,

(5.2)

and will in the next two sections determine the r.h.s. of this equation when
restricted to so(2, 1) singlets. as this part is necessarily somewhat technical,
it may be skipped on a rst reading; the results are summarized and discussed
in section 5.3 below.

22

5.1 the space of so(2, 1) singlets

the supercurl m may be decomposed according to the spin of so(2, 1).
recalling the notation of section 3.3, and equation (3.14) in particular, the
generators of so(2, 1) act on the supercurl m as

km = jkm + m j t

k + (jk)

 m .

(5.3)

we label the total so(2, 1) spin by  and its z-component (i.e. the eigenvalue
of 0 which is raised resp. lowered by ) by 0. according to the action of
0, the value of 0 is given by the dierence of barred and unbarred indices in
a supereld m,1...p. the space of so(2, 1) singlets m=0 is obtained from
the space with vanishing z-component, m0=0, by dividing out the action of
. equivalently, one has the relation

dim m=0 = dim m0=0  dim m0=1 .

(5.4)

the latter characterization will moreover be helpful to obtain the remaining
so(7) representation structure of m=0.

specically, m[p]

0=0 is spanned by vectors

m,1...k1,1...k+1
m,1...k,1...k
m,1...k+1,1...k1

with 2k = p ,

(5.5)



and the space of singlets m[p]
action of the generator +:

=0 is obtained from (5.5) by modding out the

m,1...k2[k1,1...k+1] = 0

(5.6)

k m,1...k1[k,1...k] = m,1...k1,1...k+1

k m,1...k1[k,1...k] = m,1...k1,1...k+1

(k+1) m,1...k[k+1,1...k1] = m,1...k,1...k  m,1...k,1...k .

similar relations are obtained from the action of  on the vectors (5.5),
these may however already be deduced from (5.6) and are not independent.
in particular, one derives the symmetry relations

m,1...k1,1...k+1 = m,1...k+1,1...k1

(5.7)

m,1...k,1...k = m,1...k,1...k

23

the relations (5.6) show that in fact,

the so(2, 1) singlets are
parametrized by their part m (together with a symmetrization condition),
which determines m and m. for the analysis of the eld content, it turns
out to be helpful to introduce (yet) another decomposition of m:

m = n + en

with ( n = {m + m}
en = {m  m}

(5.8)

this decomposition is orthogonal w.r.t. the scalar product (4.20). the
eld content of the supereld m has been essentially encoded in the op-
erators s and k from (4.8) and (4.28), respectively. we denote by sn and
kn , respectively, their projections onto n according to the decomposition
(5.8)

sn : n  n ,

kn : n  n .

in analogy to (4.12) and (4.23), we dene the decompositions of n into
eigenspaces of sn and kn by

n = n + + n  ,

with (sn  2) n  = 0 ,

(5.9)

and

n = n + nk ,

with kn n = 0 .

(5.10)

it is then easy to observe that (5.8) is compatible with (and somewhat tai-
lored for) the weak dynamical constraint (4.28) in the sense that k and kn
commute and have coinciding eigenvalues with

m = n ,

nk  mk .

(5.11)

the operator sn however does not commute with its ancestor s and corre-
spondingly has eigenvalues which do not necessarily coincide with those of
s. however, since (5.8) is an orthogonal decomposition, it follows that the
eigenvalues of sn lie in the interval [p, 2]. moreover, eigenvectors of sn
with eigenvalues p and 2, respectively, are necessarily also eigenvectors of
s.

24

5.2 the relevant subspaces

equations (5.8), (5.9) and (5.11) allow to rewrite (5.2) as

dim m+

k = dim m+  dim n + dim n 



= dim m+  dim n + + n +
k .

(5.12)

in the following, we are going to determine the three spaces on the r.h.s.

restricted to the sector of so(2, 1) singlets.

5.2.1 the space m+

=0

here, we determine the decomposition (4.12) on the space of so(2, 1) singlets

m[p]

=0 = m+ [p]

=0 + m [p]
=0 .

(5.13)

the corresponding decomposition of m[p]

0 with xed 0 may be obtained
from (4.13) by analyzing the decomposition of the young tableaux under
16 7 8+8. together with (5.4), the dimension of the space m+
=0 is then
given by (depicted as an illustration for p = 8, but likewise valid for all even
values of p  2)

m+ [p]

where each box now represents a 8 of so(7). the second equality in (5.14)
is obtained from standard young tableaux manipulations. in particular, this
gives the dimension

dim m+ [p]

=0 = (cid:18) 8

k(cid:19)
k+1(cid:19)(cid:18) 9

17k + 7

(k + 1)(k + 2)

.

(5.15)

25

5.2.2 the space n +

=0

the space n is organized such that the so(2, 1) singlets in n are
parametrized by their part m together with the condition

m,1...k2[k1,1...k+1] = 0 .

(5.16)

by means of the relations (5.6), this determines m and m. in particu-
lar, this allows to describe the action of the operator sn entirely in terms
of its action onto m. combining (4.8) and (5.6) one obtains after some
calculation

(sn m) = 2(k  1) m1(,)2...k1,1...k+1 1 . . . k11 . . . k+1(5.17)

+ (k21) m1(,)2...k1,12...k+1 1 . . . k11 . . . k+1

 (k+1) m1(|,1...k1,|)2...k+1 1 . . . k1 1 . . . k+1 .

since sn acts by merely permuting indices, it already follows from the form
of the condition (5.16) that it can have no more than four distinct eigenspaces
which are given by certain young tableaux symmetrizations in the (2k +2)
indices. more precisely, one nds  similarly to (4.11)  the equation

(sn  2) (sn  (2k)) (2sn  (13k)) = 0 ,

(5.18)

which determines the eigenvalues of sn . the corresponding eigenspaces are
given by the following young tableaux (again depicted for p = 8, but likewise
valid for all even values of p  2)

eigenvalues of sn :

26

the space n + is the sum of eigenspaces of sn with eigenvalues other than
2(13k), respectively.

2, i.e. according to (5.18) with eigenvalues (2k) and 1
comparing the young tableaux from (5.19) with (5.14) we nd that

dim n +

=0 = dim m+

=0 .

(5.20)

this is a key equation in our analysis of the eld content. according to (5.12)
it reduces the problem of determining the eld content in the supereld m
to the space n +
k which has very simple properties and may explicitly be given
as we shall show now.

5.2.3 the space n +

k =0

the space n +
k
it follows from (5.17) and (5.19) that n = n + and hence n +
nonempty. explicitly, it is

is dened to be the intersection of n + and nk. for p = 2,
k = nk is

k = nm,12 =  i

cijo  7 + 21 .

(5.21)

in contrast to the structure with the strong dynamical constraint (4.24),
the weak constraint (4.28) hence leaves some components of the level p = 2
undetermined. this means that additional elds are arising and will later on
appear to be coupled to the original yang-mills elds.

we will now show that at the higher levels p  4, the space n +

k is empty
and hence no further physical elds arise; the eld content of the model is thus
completely contained in the lowest two levels of the supercurl. according to
(4.28), the space nk is given by the restriction of superelds m onto their
trace part in the indices (). it follows from the form of the conditions (5.6)
that the operator (kn sn kn ) has only one nonvanishing eigenvalue which
is determined from (5.17)

(kn sn kn ) = 1

4 (k2) kn .

(5.22)

since kn is an orthogonal projector, comparing this relation with the eigen-
values of sn on n + shows, that n +

k can be nonempty only if

for k = 2 (i.e. p = 4) one may furthermore show by a similar but slightly more
complicated analysis of the operator (kn s2

we leave details to the reader.

27

5.3 the eld content

summarizing these results, we have proven that the space m+
k =0 is empty
for all levels p  4. according to the general discussion of the section 4, this
shows that physical elds arise only at the lowest two levels of the supercurl
m whereas all higher order levels are determined by the system (4.29) as
functions of the physical elds.

let us collect the physical eld content. at p = 0, clearly, sm [0] = 0,
rm [0] = 0. thus m [0] = m [0]+ and the level zero is hence completely arbi-
trary. the physical elds are projected out by (4.22). we nd the supercurl
m to contain the independent components xi and bij of which the for-
mer is part of the original yang-mills vector potential whereas the latter
represents an additional antisymmetric tensor eld

m [0]

 = i

 xi + ij

 bij  7 + 21 .

(5.24)

we recall, that bij appears additionally in this case as compared to the
strong supereld constraint (4.24). this has of course already been observed
in (4.27).

at level p = 2 we have determined the size of the space of physical elds
by computing the space nk and making use of (5.12) and (5.20). we nd
additional elds which we denote by zi and cij. explicitly, they arise as

where the dots . . . denote the terms that are determined by derivatives and
bilinear combinations of the elds from the lowest level. these contributions
are given explicitly in equation (6.4), below.

summarizing, we have shown that in the sector of so(2, 1) singlets, the
supercurl m in transverse gauge and with the weak superspace constraint
(4.28) imposed, is determined in all orders by the set of physical elds

xi , bij , zi , cij ,

(5.26)

which enter as components at the levels p = 0 and p = 2 of the supereld
expansion of m. in the following, we will study what kind of dynamical
relations we may in addition extract for these elds.

6 field equations.

in this section we will determine the eld equations implied by the weak
dynamical constraint (4.28) onto the elds (5.26). to this end, we explicitly
analyze the lowest supereld levels of m. following the general discussion
of section 4, the dynamical equations arise from projecting the image of the
operator t according to (4.31) onto m
.

in the foregoing analysis of the eld content we were able to consistently
truncate the problem to the subspace of so(2, 1) singlets, since the operators
s and k encoding the eld content via (4.29) transform as singlets under the
so(2, 1)  so(7). once we are taking the full system (4.29) into account,
this truncation fails due to the nontrivial transformation behavior of the level
raising operator t . since t depends linearly on the spatial derivatives

t 

  xa

(t a)

 a ,

(6.1)

it apparently contains parts transforming as (3, 1) and (1, 7), respectively,
under the so(2, 1)  so(7). in particular, the t i preserve the so(2, 1) spin
whereas (t , t 8) transforms as a vector under so(2, 1). correspondingly,
t + and t  raise and lower, respectively, the zcomponent of the so(2, 1)
spin.

we may hence restrict the analysis of the eld content and dynamical
equations described above to the corresponding chains of subspaces; however,
starting from so(2, 1) singlets at the lowest level will then certainly involve
higher spin elds in the higher supereld components. for simplicity, we
will hence in the following treat the system upon dimensional reduction to
seven dimensions. dropping the coordinate dependence of all elds on x8,
x implies that also the operator t transforms as an so(2, 1) singlet. in
this case we may consistently truncate the system (4.29) neglecting all elds
with higher so(2, 1) spins. in section 7 below, we comment on the extension
of the analysis to higher spin elds.

6.1 level p = 2

with the strong constraint (4.24) imposed, the level p = 2 is uniquely deter-
mined by the physical elds of the lower levels by the lowest order component
of equation (5.1)

where

m [2]

 = (a) (a

bc)12 12 ybc .

yab = axb  bxa + [xa, xb] .

(6.2)

(6.3)

in particular, neither are there new elds arising in the level p = 2 compo-
nents of m, nor do we obtain any restrictions on the elds of the lower
levels.

let us turn to the weak dynamical constraint. as we have shown above,
at the level p = 2 of the supereld m we nd new elds arising. here,
we complement the formulae (5.25) by explicitly giving the terms which are
determined by derivatives and bilinear combinations of the lowest order elds
bij and xi:

no eld equations arise at this level, i.e. the projection (4.31) turns out

to be satised without imposing any restrictions on the level zero elds.

6.2 level p = 4

on this level, we expect the dynamical equations for the lowest level elds.
in particular, the strong dynamical constraint is known to imply the bosonic
yang-mills equations of motion on this level. the weaker constraint corre-
spondingly should give rise to some analogue for the elds (5.26).

let us rst recapitulate the case of the strong constraint. the group
decomposition of superelds on this level is given in table (b.4). it shows
already that m
 is nonempty but contains e.g. the vector representation 10
of so(9, 1) arising on this level. according to (4.31) the dynamical equation
is given by the scalar product

since this is the nondegenerate scalar product on a space of multiplicity one,
it suces to show that t m [2]

one might expect to nd further relations in the 120 and 126, respectively,
from which according to (b.4) the space m
 also has nonvanishing contri-
butions. however, the rst one contains precisely the bianchi identities of
yab which are automatically satised, whereas there is no nontrivial image of
t into the 126 as one may easily verify. thus, in agreement with [8], there
arise no further restrictions than the yang-mills equations of motion (6.6),
here.

we now turn to the weak dynamical constraint. having shown that
k = 0 on all higher levels p  4, we may invert the relation (4.32) to

m+
nd

dim m

 = dim m  dim m+ ,

(6.7)

31

where the numbers on the r.h.s. may be extracted from the representation
tables collected in appendix b.

we rst consider the so(7) singlet 1 which appears in a particularly
simple way in (b.5), namely with multiplicity one. moreover, the table shows
that

mult m


[4]
1 = 1 ,

(6.8)

i.e. according to (4.31), a dynamical equation arises from the scalar product

dm



[4]

1 (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) (cid:0)t m [2]  2

3c[4](cid:1) ,

similarly to (6.5), this scalar product is particularly simple to compute be-
cause it lives on a space m[4]
1 of multiplicity one. with the explicit expression
from (6.4) we arrive at the rst eld equation for the enlarged system

with m [2] given by (6.4) .

(6.9)

dizi = (cid:2)bij, yij + 2cij(cid:3) .

(6.10)

note, that this equation has no analogue in the original yang-mills system
since in that system there is no combination of elds and derivatives trans-
forming as singlet of so(9, 1) at this order.

let us continue with the vector part 7 which should contain the analogue
of the yang-mills equations of motion. for illustration, we will describe this
sector in some detail. according to the general proceeding outlined above,
we rst determine the subspace m
 which by projection gives rise to the
dynamical equations of the system.
it follows from (b.5) and (6.7) that
[4]
m
7 is nonempty with multiplicity one. to determine this space explicitly,

[4]
it suces to diagonalize the operator s from (4.8) on the space m
7 . a
basis of the latter is e.g. given by

(w1)i

this gives the extension of the yang-mills equations for the enlarged system
associated to the weak dynamical constraint and reduces to the former in
absence of the additional elds bij, zi, cij.

similarly, one may continue with all the other so(7) subrepresentations
contained in m at this level. in the lowest dimensional parts, we nd in
addition another (rst-order) eld equation in the 35 of so(7):

d[i cjk]  1

where the coecients 1, . . . , 6 on the r.h.s. remain to be xed. the content
of this equation as it stands, is thus the nonvanishing of the l.h.s., ensuring
the existence of a eld equation which involves the additional elds cij and
zj.

it further remains to identify possible dynamical restrictions arising from
the higher dimensional so(7) subrepresentations on this level. we leave this
task for future work.

since the dynamical equations (6.10), (6.13), and (6.14) depend essen-
tially on a computation performed on the computer, at this point, some
comments on the numerical credibility of these results are in order. the
general form of the eld equations is determined from group theory, the pro-
jection (4.31) merely determines the numerical prefactors; in particular, the
existence of these equations depends exclusively on the non-vanishing of the

relative factors on the l.h.s. of (6.10), (6.13), and (6.14), respectively. this
procedure is certainly extremely sensitive to any kind of computational er-
rors. however, we can at any point in the calculation check and verify the
general algebraic relations (4.11), (4.14) and (4.15), as well as explicitly re-
produce the multiplicities of subrepresentations collected in appendix b. this
provides a sucient number of checks to trust the numerical results, i.e. the
existence of (6.10), (6.13), and (6.14).

6.3 comments on the physics

the spectrum of so(2, 1) singlets involves two pairs of elds (xi, zi and
bij, cij) with the same tensorial structure, but with dierent dimensions,
since xi, bij, and zi, cij have dimensions one and two, respectively. the
eld c seems to be associated with x. as a matter of fact, it is possible6
to rewrite the eld equations (6.10), (6.13), (6.14) solely in terms of y + c.
then, if we reduce to four dimensions, there is a striking analogy with the
case of electromagnetism in the presence of magnetic charge (see e.g. ref.[14]),
where the eld strength is build from two pieces, a homogeneous one such
that the bianchi identity gives zero, and another piece for which the bianchi
identity gives the magnetic current. thus, we conclude that our dynamics in
general involves magnetic charges.

on the other hand, the eld b has the features of a two-form vector
potential. an intriguing question is the role of the corresponding gauge
transformations bij  bij + d[ij] + . . .. however, the form of possible in-
teractions with higher form gauge potentials appears to be highly restricted
on general grounds (see [15] for a recent discussion). in the system studied
here, the dynamical equation for b would be determined from the repre-
sentation 21 at p = 4, which we have not yet fully investigated, since the
calculation is rather delicate. for the moment, it is hence still possible that
all terms vanish identically, such that there would be no eld equation for
b. then b would be an arbitrary background eld. finally, the role of zi
is unclear. it is somewhat surprising that it satises a rst order dierential
equations. we leave all these questions to future studies.

6provided that 1 and 2 come out to be equal in (6.14), and after adding a term

proportional to djbij to zi,

7 summary and outlook.

in this paper we have studied the eld content and the eld equations implied
by the weak dynamical constraint (3.11) as opposed to the usually employed
strong dynamical constraint (2.9) which is known to be equivalent to the
yang-mills equations of motion. the motivation for the weak constraint
stemmed from the fact that it may be obtained as integrability condition of
a lax representation with scalar spectral parameter (3.10) which bears strong
similarity with the lax connection for selfdual four-dimensional yang-mills
theory.

the underlying symmetry of the weak constraint is so(2, 1)  so(7)
rather than the original so(9, 1). we have determined the physical eld
content of the theory in the space of so(2, 1) singlets and shown that it re-
stricts to the elds (5.26) appearing on the lowest two levels of the supercurl
m. this naturally raises the question on the existence of closed recurrence
relations, which, in analogy to (5.1), would explicitly determine the higher
supereld levels of the supercurl. in fact, by manipulating the bianchi identi-
ties together with (3.11), one may obtain supereld equations which in their
lowest component reproduce (6.4). in particular, the new elds cij and zi

tively. complementing these equations by similar relations for the superelds

appear as level zero components of additional superelds ecij and ezi, respec-
ecij, ezi, one arrives at a system of recurrence relations which determine the

supereld m entirely in terms of the physical elds (5.26) from the lowest
orders. the dynamical equations (6.10), (6.13) and (6.14), implied by the
weak superspace constraint, will then be likewise promoted from component
equations to supereld equations. details remain to be worked out. more
importantly, it remains to actually construct explicit solutions of the lax
equations (3.10) with the required form of the dependence upon the spectral
parameter (equation (3.17) and (3.19), respectively).

the above analysis of supereld components and dynamical equations
has been restricted to the system after dimensional reduction to seven di-
mensions. in this case, we could consistently truncate the eld content to
so(2, 1) singlets which essentially simplied the situation. in principle, the
same method can be applied including the higher so(2, 1) spin elds, though
the calculations become far more tedious. we mention here some of the novel
features which may be discovered already at level p = 4.

first, the dynamical equations (6.10), (6.13), (6.14), obtained in the re-

35

duced situation, receive additional contributions due to the action of the
(3, 1) part of the operator t in (4.31).
in particular, the completion of
equation (6.13) will at least contain terms d8fi8, dfi since obviously the
weak superspace constraint (4.28) cannot yield equations stronger than the
original yang-mills equations of motion (6.6).

in addition, the original yang-mills equations of motion now contain a
part transforming in the (3, 1) which should be recovered from the corre-
sponding sector at level p = 4. however, here an essential qualitative dier-
[4]
ence arises: the space m 
(3,1) is empty. thus, with the weak superspace

constraint (3.11) this part of the original dynamical equations disappears
and we go truly o-shell.
it may, however, not be excluded that further
dynamical restrictions arise at the higher levels in the supercurl m.

finally, we discover that for the full system, the supereld level p = 4
in particular, we nd new
is not entirely determined by the lower levels.
independent elds arising at this level in the (5, 7) and (5, 21) of so(2, 1) 
so(7), i.e. with so(2, 1) spin 2. to obtain closed recurrence relations for
the supercurl m one would thus be forced to include at least the next level
p = 6 in the analysis. likewise, the dynamical eld content will essentially
depend on the higher levels. we leave this for future work.

another point we have omitted so far, is the fermionic spectrum of the
theory which may be analyzed with exactly the same methods that have been
presented here for the bosonic sector. in particular, the (possibly broken)
supersymmetry should help to better understand the nature of the underlying
physical system.

we nally mention the possibility to recover in this framework and upon
dimensional reduction some of the classical higher spin gauge theories, which
have been constructed by vasiliev (see e.g. [16] for a review) and recently
[17] been brought into the context of a possible m-theoretic origin.

a the o(9, 1) characters.

in this appendix, we compute the characters of the reducible representations
which appear in section 4 . the path followed is similar to the calculation
of string characters of ref.[13], and we shall refer to that paper for details.

in general, the o(9, 1) characters are dened as (~v) = tr (cid:0)ep i vihi(cid:1), where

vi are arbitrary parameters, where the trace is taken in the representation
considered, and hi, i = 1, . . . , 5 are a set of ve commuting elements of the
lie algebra. using a parametrization analogous to the one used in ref.[13]
for o(8) spinors, one easily sees for instance that the character of the 16
representation7 is given by

concerning the  part, one works in an occupation number basis where
n =  is simultaneously diagonal for  = 1,    , 16. since the lie
group generators commute with the grading operator r, it is convenient to

the role of r is played by the virasoro generator l0. altogether, one nds

it would be interesting to derive the characters +

the multiplicities of mk, m here are determined by computing the decom-
position of tensor products

(8  8)s  (8  8  . . .  8)a  (8  8  . . .  8)a ,

etc. ;

to obtain the multiplicities of m one needs in addition the decomposition
of the young tableaux (4.13).

at level p = 4 we nd with the strong constraint (4.24) the following

multiplicities of the lowest dimensional so(9, 1) representations

so(9, 1) mult.
