null branes in curved backgrounds 1

p. bozhilov 2

bogoliubov laboratory of theoretical physics,

jinr, 141980 dubna, russia

we consider null bosonic p-branes in curved space-times. some exact solutions of
the classical equations of motion and of the constraints for the null membrane in general
stationary, axially symmetrical, four dimensional, gravity background are found.

1 introduction

the null (tensionless) p-branes correspond to usual p-branes with their tension tp
taken to be zero. this relationship between null p-branes and the tensionful ones may
be regarded as a generalization of the massless-massive particles correspondence. the
dynamics of the null branes in curved backgrounds is interesting also as a generalization
of the motion of null strings in such backgrounds [1], [2], [3], [4], [5].

a model for null p-branes living in friedmann-robertson-walker space-time (with
k = 0) was proposed in [6]. the motion equations were solved and it was shown there
that an ideal uid of null p-branes may be considered as a source of gravity.

here we investigate the classical evolution of the null branes in a curved background.
in sec. 2 we give the corresponding lagrangian formulation. in sec. 3 the brst-bfv
approach in its hamiltonian version is applied to the considered dynamical system. in
sec. 4 some exact solutions of the equations of motion and of the constraints for the
null membrane in general stationary, axially symmetrical, four dimensional, gravity
background are found. the examples of minkowski, de sitter, schwarzschild and kerr
space-times are considered in sec. 5. sec. 6 is devoted to comments and conclusions.

2 lagrangian formulation

the action for the bosonic null p-brane in a d-dimensional curved space-time

with metric tensor g(x) can be written in the form:

s = z dp+1l

,

l = v j v kj xkxg(x),

(1)

j = /j ,

j = (0, j) = (, j),
,  = 0, 1, ..., d  1.

it is an obvious generalization of the at space-time action given in [7].

to prove the invariance of the action under innitesimal dieomorphisms on the
world volume (reparametrizations), we rst write down the corresponding transforma-
tion law for the (r,s)-type tensor density of weight a

t j1...jr

k1...ks[a] = lt j1...jr

k1...ks[a] = llt j1...jr

where l is the lie derivative along the vector eld . using (2), one veries that if
x(), g() are world-volume scalars (a = 0) and v j () is a world-volume (1,0)-type
tensor density of weight a = 1/2, then j x is a (0,1)-type tensor, j xkxg is a
(0,2)-type tensor and l is a scalar density of weight a = 1. therefore,

s = z dp+1j (jl)

and this variation vanishes under suitable boundary conditions.

the equations of motion following from (1) are:

j(cid:16)v j v kkx(cid:17) + 

v j v kj xkx = 0,
v j j xkxg(x) = 0,

where 

 is the connection compatible with the metric g(x):



 =

2

g(g + g  g).

for the transition to hamiltonian picture it is convenient to rewrite the lagrangian

density (1) in the form ( = /, j = /j ):

l =

1
40 g(x)(  jj)x(  kk)x,

where

v j = (v 0, v j) =  

1
20

,

j

20!.

now the equation of motion for x takes the form:

20 (  kk)xi  jh j
h 1

20 (  kk)xi
(  jj)x(  kk)x = 0.

(4)

the equations of motion for the lagrange multipliers 0 and j which follow from (3)
give the constraints :

g(x)(  jj)x(  kk)x = 0,
g(x)(  kk)xjx = 0.
in terms of x and the conjugated momentum p they read:

t0 = g(x)pp = 0

,

tj = pjx = 0.

3 hamiltonian formulation

the hamiltonian which corresponds to the lagrangian density (3) is a linear

combination of the constraints (6) :

h0 = z dp(0t0 + jtj).

they satisfy the following (equal  ) poisson bracket algebra

{t0(1), t0(2)} = 0,
{t0(1), tj(2)} = [t0(1) + t0(2)]jp(1  2),
{tj(1), tk(2)} = [l
 = (1, ..., p).

ktj(2)]lp(1  2),

jtk(1) + l

(7)

the equalities (7) show that the constraint algebra is the same for at and for curved
backgrounds. having in mind the above algebra, one can construct the corresponding
brst charge  [8] (*=complex conjugation)

 = min + j p j ,
min in (8) can be written as [9]

{, } = 0,

 = .

(8)

min = z dp{t00 + tjj + p0[(jj)0 + (j0)j] + pk(jk)j},

and can be represented also in the form

min = z dp[(t0 +

t gh
0 )0 + (tj +

t gh

j )j] +z dpj(cid:16)1

2pkkj(cid:17).

here a superscript gh is used for the ghost part of the total gauge generators

j = {,pj} = {min,pj} = tj + t gh
t tot
j .

we recall that the poisson bracket algebras of t tot
which is the case under consideration. the manifest expressions for t gh

j and tj coincide for rst rank systems

j are:

t gh
0 = 2p0jj + (jp0)j,
t gh
j = 2p0j0 + (jp0)0 + pjkk + pkjk + (kpj)k.

3

up to now, we introduced canonically conjugated ghosts (j ,pj ), (j , p j ) and mo-
menta j for the lagrange multipliers j in the hamiltonian. they have poisson
brackets and grassmann parity as follows (j is the grassmann parity of the corre-
sponding constraint):

{j,pk} = j
k,
{j , p k} = (1)j k k
j ,
{j, k} = j
k,

(j ) = (j ) = j .

(j ) = (pj ) = j + 1,

(j ) = ( p j ) = j + 1,

the brst-invariant hamiltonian is

h  = h min + { , } = { , },

(9)

because from hcanonical = 0 it follows h min = 0. in this formula  stands for the gauge
xing fermion (  =  ). we use the following representation for the latter

 = min + j (j +

1
2

(j)j ),

min = jpj ,

where (j) are scalar parameters and we have separated the j -dependence from j . if
we adopt that j does not depend on the ghosts (j ,pj ) and (j , p j ), the hamiltonian
h  from (9) takes the form

h  = h min

 + pj p j  j (j +

1
2

(j)j ) +

(10)

where

+ j{j , tk}k,

h min
 = {min, min}.

one can use the representation (10) for h  to obtain the corresponding brst

invariant lagrangian density

l  = l + lgh + lgf .

here l is given in (3), lgh stands for the ghost part and lgf - for the gauge xing
part of the lagrangian density. the manifest expressions for lgh and lgf are [9]:

lgh =  0 0   j j + 0[2 0jj + (j 0)j]
+j[2 0j0 + (j 0)0 +  kjk +  jkk + (k j)k]
+z dp{ 0()[{t0, 0()}0 + {tj, 0()}j]
+ j()[{t0, j()}0 + {tk, j()}k]},
( j  j)( j  j).

if one does not intend to pass to the lagrangian formalism, one may restrict oneself
in particular, this means that lagrange

to the minimal sector (min, min, h min

).

multipliers are not considered as dynamical variables anymore. with this particular
gauge choice, h min

is a linear combination of the total constraints



h min

 = z dph0t tot

0 () + jt tot

j ()i,

and we can treat here the lagrange multipliers 0, j as constants. of course, this
does not x the gauge completely.

4 null membranes in d=4

here we conne ourselves to the case of membranes moving in a four dimensional,

stationary, axially symmetrical, gravity background of the type

ds2 = g00(dx0)2 + g11(dx1)2 + g22(dx2)2 + g33(dx3)2 + 2g03dx0dx3,
g = g(x1, x2).

(11)

we will work in the gauge 0, j = constants, in which the equations of motion (4)
and constraints (5) for the membrane (j, k = 1, 2) have the form:

(  jj)(  kk)x + 

(  jj)x(  kk)x = 0.
g(x)(  jj)x(  kk)x = 0,
g(x)(  kk)xjx = 0.

(12)

(13)

to establish the correspondence with the null geodesics we note that if we introduce
the quantities

u(x) = (  jj)x,

(14)

the equations of motion (12) can be rewritten as

u(u + 

u) = 0.

then it follows from here that u2 do not depend on x. in this notations, the constraints
are:

guu = 0

,

gujx = 0.

taking into account the metric (11), one can write the equations of motion (12)

and the constraints (13) in the form:

(  jj)u0 + 2(cid:16)0

02u0 + 3

where the notation introduced in (14) is used. to simplify these equations, we make
the ansatz

x0(, ) = f 0(z1, z2) + t( ),
x1(, ) = r( )
x3(, ) = f 3(z1, z2) + ( ),

,

x2(, ) = ( ),

(16)

zj = j + j,

where f 0, f 3 are arbitrary functions of their arguments.

after substituting (16) in (15), we receive (the dot is used for dierentiation with

respect to the ane parameter  ):

(20)

(22)

if we choose

f 0(z1, z2) = f 0(w)

,

f 3(z1, z2) = f 3(w),

where w = w(z1, z2) is an arbitrary function of z1 and z2, then the system of equations
(22) reduces to the single equation

df 0

to be able to separate the variables u0, u3 in the system of dierential equations
(17), (20) with the help of (23), we impose the following condition on f 0(w) and f 3(w)

f 0(w) = c 0f [w(z1, z2)]

,

f 3(w) = c 3f [w(z1, z2)],

where c 0, c 3 are constants, and f (w) is an arbitrary function of w. then the solution
of (17), (20) and (23) is [4] (c1 = const):

u0( ) = c1(cid:16)c 0g03 + c 3g33(cid:17) exp(h),
u3( ) = +c1(cid:16)c 0g00 + c 3g03(cid:17) exp(h),
h = z (cid:16)g00dg00 + 2g03dg03 + g33dg33(cid:17).

the condition for the compatibility of (24) with (18), (19) and (21) is:

u0( ) = c1(cid:16)c 0g03 + c 3g33(cid:17) h1
u3( ) = +c1(cid:16)c 0g00 + c 3g03(cid:17) h1

= c1(cid:16)c 3g00  c 0g03(cid:17) = t( ),
= c1(cid:16)c 3g03  c 0g33(cid:17) = ( ),

h = g00g33  g2

on the other hand, from (19) and (21) one has:

in obtaining (27), we have used the gauge freedom in the metric (11), to impose the

as a nal result we have

x0 = c 0f [w(z1, z2)] + t( ),
x1 = r( ),
x2 = ( ),
x3 = c 3f [w(z1, z2)] + ( ),

where t( ), r( ), ( ), ( ) are given by (25), (26), and (27).

in the particular case when x2 =  = 0 = const, one can integrate to obtain
the following exact solutions of the equations of motion and constraints for the null
membrane in the gravity background (11):

5 examples

here we give some examples of solutions of the type received in the previous
section. to begin with, let us start with the simplest case of minkowski space-time.
the metric is

g00 = 1,

g11 = 1,

g22 = r2,

g33 = r2sin2,

g00 = (cid:16)1  kr2(cid:17) , g11 = (cid:16)1  kr2(cid:17)1

where k is the constant curvature. now we have

now let us turn to the case of schwarzschild space-time. the corresponding metric

may be written as

g00 = (1  2mr1)
g22 = r2

,

g33 = r2sin2,

,

g11 = (1  2mr1)1,

where m is the schwarzschild mass. the equalities (25), (26) and (27) read

in equations (25), (26) and (27), we have:

6 comments and conclusions

from the results of the previous sections, it is easy to extract the corresponding
formulas for the null string case simply by putting 1 = , 1 = , 2 = 2 = 0. for
example, our equalities (29) coincide with the ones obtained in [3] for the null string
moving in schwarzschild space-time after identication:

e = c1c 3,

l = c1c 0,

l2 + k = c2.

moreover, our solution (30) in the case p = 1, generalizes the solution given in [4]. the
latter corresponds to xing the arbitrary function f (w) to a linear one and xing the
gauge to  = 0, i.e.

f [w(1 + 1, 2 + 2)] 7 f ( + ) =  + ,

with

 = 0.

in this paper we perform some investigation on the classical dynamics of the null
bosonic branes in curved background. in the second section we give the action, prove
its reparametrization invariance and give the equations of motion and constraints in an
arbitrary gauge. then we construct the corresponding hamiltonian and compute the
constraint algebra. following [8], we obtain the manifest expressions for the classical
brst charge, the total constraints, the brst invariant hamiltonian and the brst
invariant lagrangian. all this gives the possibility for quantization of the null p-
branes in a curved space-time. in the fourth section we consider the dynamics of the
null membranes (p = 2) in a four dimensional, stationary, axially symmetrical, gravity
background. some exact solutions of the equations of motion and of the constraints are
found there. the next section is devoted to examples of such solutions in minkowski,
de sitter, schwarzschild and kerr space-times.
