abstract

we apply the antield quantization method of batalin and vilkovisky to the calcu-
lation of the path integral for the poisson-sigma model in a general gauge. for a linear
poisson structure the model reduces to a nonabelian gauge theory, and we obtain the for-
mula for the partition function of two-dimensional yang-mills theory for closed oriented
two-dimensional manifolds.

introduction

the poisson-sigma model associates to any poisson structure on a nite-dimensional manifold
a two-dimensional eld theory [1]. choosing dierent poisson structures leads to specic
models which include most of the topological and semi-topological eld theories which have
been of interest in recent years. these include gravity models, non-abelian gauge theories and
the wess-zumino-witten model. under some natural restrictions these models are completely
integrable.

when the two-dimensional spacetime is a cylinder the poisson-sigma model can be quan-
tized with the canonical quantization procedure [2]. in this paper we use the path integral
method in order to perform the quantization for arbitrary world sheet topologies.

in the language of gauge theories the models considered here involve an open gauge alge-
bra, i.e. the algebra closes only on-shell. in such cases the faddeev-popov method of path
integral quantization fails. quantization procedures which rely on the brst symmetry of
the extended action are in principle more powerful [3]. we nd that for our purposes the
antield formalism of batalin and vilkovisky [4] is the most eective quantization method.

the path integral approach for the poisson-sigma model was rst discussed in a prelim-
in a recent paper cattaneo and felder [5] use the

inary way by schaller and strobl [2].

perturbation expansion of the path integral in the covariant gauge to elucidate kontsevichs
formula for the deformation quantization of the algebra of functions on a poisson manifold
[6]. kummer, liebl and vassilevich have investigated the special case of 2d dilaton gravity in
the temporal gauge, and they have calculated the generating functional using brst methods
[7]. in further work they have studied the coupling to matter elds [8]. we present here a
complete and general derivation of the partition function for the poisson-sigma model for
an arbitrary gauge. in the study of the chern-simons topological gauge theory it is known
that dierent choices of the gauge-xing function lead to dierent integral representations of
the associated knot invariants: the light-cone gauge leads to the universal kontsevich inte-
gral [9] , the landau gauge to the covariant integrals of bott and taubes [10],[11] and the
temporal gauge to the singular integrals studied by labastida and perez [12]. the relation
between these various representations is at present not well-understood, in particular no one
has been able to reproduce the necessary kontsevich normalization factor from a path integral
approach. we hope that the techniques developed here may be helpful in that context.

our paper is structured as follows. in section 2 we give a concise but self-contained review
of the batalin-vilkovisky quantization procedure for gauge theories. in section 3 we apply
the method to the poisson-sigma model. in section 4 we show how the general model reduces
under certain circumstances to the more familiar yang-mills case, and that we reproduce in
this case the formula for the partition function [13]. section 5 contains our conclusions and
an outlook for further research.

2 the antield formalism for the quantization

of gauge theories

2.1 the structure equations of gauge theories

the batalin-vilkovisky formalism has a beautiful geometric interpretation, rst discovered
by witten [14], and recently described in the paper of alexandrov et. al. [15]. here we are
not concerned with these aspects; we just want to show how the formalism can be applied.
we restrict our account to irreducible dynamical systems. for further details we refer to the
recent review by gomis, paris and stuart [16].

we consider a system whose dynamics is governed by a classical action s0[i] which
depends on the elds i(x), i = 1, . . . , n. in the following we shall use a compact notation in
which the multi-index i may denote the various elds involved, the discrete indices on which
they may depend, and the dependence on the spacetime variables as well. the generalized
summation convention then means that a repeated index may denote not only a sum over
discrete variables, but also integration over the spacetime variables. i = (i) will denote
the grassman parity of the elds i. fields with i = 0 are called bosonic, elds with i = 1
fermionic. the graded commutation rule is

i(x)j(y) = (1)ij j(y)i(x).

(2.1)

for a gauge theory the action is invariant under a set of m gauge transformations with

innitesimal form

i = ri

 ,  = 1 or 2 or . . . m.

(2.2)

this is compact notation for

i(x) = (ri

())(x)

= x z dy ri

(x, y) (y).

(2.3)

the (x) are the innitesimal gauge parameters and the ri
() the generators of the gauge
transformations. when  = () = 0 we have an ordinary symmetry, when  = 1 a
supersymmetry. the grassman parity of ri
) = i +  (mod 2). when the gauge
generators are independent the theory is said to be irreducible, otherwise it is reducible. for
our purposes it will be sucient to consider the irreducible case.

 is (ri

a subscript index after a comma denotes the right derivative with respect to the corre-
sponding eld, and in general when a derivative is indicated it is to be understood as a right
derivative unless specically noted to be otherwise. the eld equations may then be written
as

the classical solutions 0 are determined by s0,i|0 = 0. the noether identities are

s0,i = 0.

s0,i ri

 = 0.

the general solution to the noether identity s0,i i = 0 is

i = ri

 t  + s0,j eji.

the commutator of two gauge transformations is

[1, 2]i = (ri

since this commutator is a symmetry of the action it satises the noether identity

s0,i(ri

which by eq. (2.6) implies that

(2.18)

as in the familiar faddeev-popov procedure it is useful to introduce ghost elds c  with

opposite grassman parities to the gauge parameters ;

(c ) =  + 1,

(2.19)

and to replace the gauge parameters by ghost elds. one must then modify the graded
symmetry properties of the gauge structure tensors according to

t1234...  (1)2 +4 +... t1234...

.

the noether identities then take the form

s0,iri

c  = 0,

and the structure relations (2.9) become

(2.20)

(2.21)

(2.22)

2.2 introducing the antields

we incorporate the ghost elds into the eld set a = {i, c }, where i = 1, . . . , n and
 = 1, . . . , m. clearly a = 1, . . . , n , where n = n + m. one then further increases the set
by introducing an antield 

a for each eld a. the grassman parity of the antields is

5

we also assign to each eld a ghost number, with

(

a) = (a) + 1 (mod 2).

gh[i] = 0,
gh[c ] = 1,
gh[

a] = gh[a]  1 .

in the space of elds and antields the antibracket is dened by

(x, y ) =

rx
a

ly

a



rx

a

ly
a ,

(2.23)

(2.24)

(2.25)

(2.26)

(2.27)

where r denotes the right, l the left derivative. the antibracket is graded antisymmetric;

(x, y ) = (1)(x +1)(y +1)(y, x).

it satises a graded jacobi identity

((x, y ), z) + (1)(x +1)(y +z )((y, z), x) + (1)(z +1)(x +y )((z, x), y ) = 0.

it is a graded derivation

it has ghost number

and grassman parity

for bosonic elds

for fermionic elds

and for any x

(x, y z) = (x, y )z + (1)y x (x, z)y,
(xy, z) = x(y, z) + (1)x y y (x, z).

gh[(x, y )] = gh[x] + gh[y ] + 1

((x, y )) = (x) + (y ) + 1 (mod 2).

if we group the elds and antields together into the set

then the antibracket is seen to dene a symplectic structure on the space of elds and antields;

za = {a, 

a}, a = 1, ..., 2n,

(2.36)

with

(x, y ) =

the antields can be thought of as conjugate variables to the elds, since

(a, 

b) = a

(2.37)

(2.38)

(2.39)

2.3 the classical master equation

let s[a, 
vanishing ghost number and even grassman parity. the equation

a] be a functional of the elds and antields with the dimensions of an action,

(s, s) = 2

s
a

s

a

= 0

(2.40)

is the classical master equation. solutions of the classical master equation with suitable
boundary conditions turn out to be generating functionals for the gauge structures of the
gauge theory. s is also the starting point for the quantization of the theory.

one denotes by  the subspace of stationary points of the action in the space of elds

and antields:

given a classical solution 0 of s0 one possible stationary point is

s

za = 0(cid:27) .

 = (cid:26)za(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

i = i

0, c  = 0, 

a = 0.

(2.41)

(2.42)

an action s which satises the classical master equation has its own set of invariances:

with

this equation implies

b = 0,

b =  ac lrs

b is nilpotent on-shell. a nilpotent 2n  2n matrix has rank less than or equal

r = rank

(2.46)

lrs

zazb(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

a](cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

a=0

we then have r  n . the relevant solutions of the classical master equation are those for
which r = n .
in this case the number of independent gauge invariances of the type in
eq. (2.43) equals the number of antields. when at a later stage the gauge is xed the
non-physical antields are eliminated.

to ensure the correct classical limit the proper solution must contain the classical action

s0 in the sense that

s [a, 

= s0[i].

(2.47)

the action s[a, 
ghost number and even grassman parity:

a] can be expanded in a series in the antields, while maintaining vanishing

s[, ] = s0 +

(2.48)

when this is inserted into the classical master equation one nds that this equation implies
the gauge structure of the classical theory (see e.g. eq. (3.21) below).

2.4 gauge-xing and quantization

eq. (2.43) shows that the action s still possesses gauge invariances, and hence is not yet
suitable for quantization via the path integral approach: a gauge-xing procedure is necessary.
in the batalin-vilkovisky approach the gauge is xed, and the antields eliminated, by use
of a gauge-xing fermion  which has grassman parity () = 1 and gh[] = 1. it is a
functional of the elds a only; its relation to the antields is

we dene a surface in functional space



a =


a .

so that for any functional x[, ]



a =



a(cid:27) ,

a(cid:17)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)
 = (cid:26)(cid:16)a, 
x | = x(cid:20),



(cid:21) .

(2.49)

(2.50)

(2.51)

to construct a gauge-xing fermion  of ghost number 1 one must again introduce

additional elds. the simplest choice utilizes a trivial pair c,  with

( c) =  + 1, () = ,
gh[ c] = 1,
gh[] = 0.

(2.52)

(2.53)

8

the elds c are the faddeev-popov antighosts. along with these elds we include the
corresponding antields c , . adding the term  c  to the action s does not spoil its
properties as a proper solution to the classical master equation, and we get the non-minimal
action

the simplest possibility for  is

s non = s +  c .

 = c(),

(2.54)

(2.55)

where  are the gauge-xing conditions for the elds . we denote the gauge-xed action
by

s = s non | .

(2.56)

quantization is performed using the path integral to calculate a correlation fuction x,

with the constraint (2.49) implemented by a -function:

i(x) =z dd(cid:18)

a 



a(cid:19) exp(cid:18) i



w [, ](cid:19) x[, ].

(2.57)

here w is the quantum action, which reduces to s in the limit   0. an admissible 
leads to well-dened propagators when the path integral is expressed as a perturbation series
expansion.

the results of a calculation should be independent of the gauge-xing. consider the

integrand in eq.(2.57),

i[, ] = exp(cid:18) i



w [, ](cid:19) x[, ] .

under an innitesimal change in 

where the laplacian  is

i+(x)  i(x)  z d i  ,

 = (1)a+1 
a



a

.

(2.58)

(2.59)

(2.60)

obviously the integral i(x) is independent of  if i = 0. for x = 1 one gets the
requirement

 exp(cid:18) i



w(cid:19) = exp(cid:18) i



w(cid:19)(cid:18) i



 w

22 (w, w )(cid:19) = 0.

the formula

(w, w ) = i w

(2.61)

(2.62)

is the quantum master equation. a gauge-invariant correlation function satises

(x, w ) = i x.

9

(2.63)

the terms of higher order in  by which the quantum action w may dier from the solution
of the classical master equation s correspond to the counterterms of the renormalizable gauge
theory if

 s = 0.

(2.64)

one must of course use a regularization scheme which respects the symmetries of the theory.
for w = s + o() the quantum master equation (2.62) reduces in this case to the classical
master equation (s, s) = 0. hence, up to possible counter terms, one may simply choose
w = s. this is the case for the systems we are considering in this paper.

to implement the gauge-xing we use for the action w = s non. for the path integral
z = i(x = 1) we perform the integration over the antields in eq.(2.57) by using the
-function. the result is

z = z d exp(cid:18) i



s(cid:19) .

(2.65)

3 the path integral for the poisson-sigma model

3.1 the classical theory

a poisson manifold n is a smooth manifold equipped with a poisson structure p  2t n
[17]. in local coordinates x i on n

and p ij satises the condition

p =

1
2

p ij(x) i  j,

p i[jp lk]

,i = 0,

(3.1)

(3.2)

which reects the vanishing of the corresponding schouten-nijenhuis bracket for p with itself.
here the bracketed indices denote an antisymmetric sum. in the notation of poisson brackets

{f (x), g(x)} = p ijf,ig,j

and the jacobi identity follows from eq. (3.2):

the poisson bracket satises the leibniz derivation rule:

{f, {g, h}} + cyclic = 0.

{h, f g} = {h, f }g + f {h, g} .

(3.3)

(3.4)

(3.5)

p is in general degenerate, in which case it does not induce a symplectic structure on n , and
the map t n  t n induced by p, which maps a one-form idx i on n to the vector eld

10

ip ijj, is not surjective. however, as a consequence of the jacobi identity, the image of this
map forms an involutive system of vector elds. it then turns out that the characteristic dis-
tribution s(n ) of the poisson manifold n is completely integrable and the poisson structure
p induces symplectic structures on the leaves s, i.e. a nondegenerate symplectic structure
s on s.

indeed, the splitting theorem of weinstein [18] states that for a regular poisson manifold,
i.e. the poisson tensor has constant rank, there exist so-called casimir-darboux coordinates
on the poisson manifold n . for p degenerate there are functions f on n whose hamiltonian
vector elds xf = f,ip ijj vanish. these functions are called casimir functions. let {c i } be
a maximal set of independent casimir functions. then c i(x) = const. = c i (x0) denes a
level surface through x0 whose connected components may be identied with the symplectic
leaves. according to darbouxs theorem there are local coordinates x  on s such that the
symplectic form s is given by

s = dx 1  dx 2 + dx 3  dx 4 + . . . .

(3.6)

together with the casimir functions we then have a coordinate system {x i , x } on n with
p ij = p i = 0 and p  = constant.

we now consider a eld theory on a two dimensional world sheet m without boundary
[1]. the theory involves a set x i of bosonic scalar elds, which can be interpreted as a set
of maps x i : m  n . in addition one has a 1-form a on the world sheet m which takes
values in t n , i.e. a 1-form on m which is simultaneously the pullback of a section of t n
by x(x), where {x} are coordinates on m. this eld a = aidx  dx i reduces in the case of
a linear poisson structure, which leads to the yang-mills theory, to an ordinary gauge eld.
in these coordinates the action of the semi-topological poisson-sigma model is

s0[x, a] = zm

eqs. (3.13)-(3.18) ensure that the extended action (3.20) is a solution of the classical master

gauge-xing

we shall use gauge-xing conditions of the form i(a, x), so that the gauge fermion (2.55)

becomes  = c ii(a, x). the antields are then xed to be

we now consider dierent gauge conditions:

becomes  = c iai. the antields are xed to be:

ai =  c i,

for this gauge choice the gauge-xed action is:

(ii) now we consider the temporal gauge i = a0i. in this case the gauge fermion is given

by  = c ia0i. the antields are xed to:

a0i = c i,
a1i = 0,
x 
c 

i = c i = 0,
i = a0i.

the gauged-xed action is:

s = zm

 (cid:20) (aix i + p ij(x)aiaj) + c(x) + c idj

0icj  i(a0i)(cid:21).

(3.27)

(iii) finally we consider the schwinger-fock gauge i = xai. then the antields are

xed to be:

(3.26)

ai = x c i,
x 
c 

i = c i = 0,
i = xai.

for this gauge choice the gauge-xed action is:

s = zm

 (cid:20)(aix i + p ij(x)aiaj) + c(x) + c ixdj

icj  i(ai)(cid:21).

(3.29)

notice that in the non-covariant gauges (ii) and (iii) the action simplies, in that the term

which arose because of the non-closed gauge algebra vanishes.

(3.28)

gauge xing in casimir-darboux coordinates

important simplications occur when we write the action in casimir-darboux coordinates
x i  {x i , x }, so we go through the gauge-xing procedure again for these coordinates.
the extended action is

s = zm

 "(ai x i + a x  + p (x i )aa) + c(x i ) + aici

+ ac + x 

p (x i )c(cid:21).

(3.30)

this extended action still possesses gauge invariances, so one has to introduce a nonminimal
sector. the non-minimal action is

s non = zm

 " (ai  x i + ax  + p (x i )aa) + c(x)

+ aici + ac + x 

p (x i )c  i c 

(cid:21).
i   c 

(3.31)

in these coordinates the gauge freedom of the maps x i : m  n is reduced to the freedom
of the maps x  : m  s, where s is a symplectic leaf of the poisson manifold n . the gauge
transformations x i = p ijj reduce to

x  = p ,

x i = 0.

(3.32)

after gauge xing we need to consider only the homotopy classes [x ].

it is now possible to decompose the gauge condition into a part depending only on ai and
another part depending only on x , so that the gauge-xing of the gauge elds is implemented
by gauge conditions of the form i (ai ) and (x ). the gauge fermion may be written as

 = zm

 h c ii (ai ) + c (x )i .

(3.33)

the gauge conditions as expressed through the gauge fermion are

ai = c j j (ai )

ai

a = 0,

x

x

i = 0,

(3.34)

the gauge-xed action in casimir-darboux coordinates takes the form

s = zm

 " (ai x i + ax  + p aa)) + c(x i )

3.2 the path integral for the poisson-sigma model

using eq. (2.65) the path integral for the poisson-sigma model in casimir-darboux coordi-
nates is

z = z

dx i dx dai dadci d cidcd cdi d exp(cid:18)

1


s(cid:19) ,

(3.36)

where we have performed the usual wick rotation t = i , so that the exponent of the path
integral is now real. when the model is integrable we expect to be able to carry out the
functional integrations successively, in order to obtain a closed expression for the path integral.
we shall indeed be able to achieve this goal for the special case described in section (4).

integrating over the ghost and antighost elds yields the faddeev-popov determinants:

dx i dx dai dadiddet  i (ai )
x  p (x i )(cid:19)0(m )
z = z
" (ai x i + ax  + p aa)) + c(x i ) i i(a) (x )#
exp
zm
 ,


det(cid:18) (x )

!0(m )

ai

1

(3.37)

where the subscripts k(m ) indicate that the determinant results from an integration over
k-forms on m . the integrations over i and  yield - functions which implement the gauge
conditions.

z = z

 ,

!0(m )

det(cid:18) (x )

x  p (x i )(cid:19)0(m )

(3.38)

where from now on the integrations extend only over the degrees of freedom which respect
the gauge-xing conditions. the integration over a is gaussian, it yields

z = z

dx i dx dai det  i (ai )

ai

det1/2(cid:16)p (x i )(cid:17)1(m )

det(cid:18) (x )

x  p (x i )(cid:19)0(m )
 "(ai  x i + x x ) + c(x i )#
 .

(3.39)

16

besides the term in the exponent the only dependence on ai is in the relevant faddeev-
popov determinant. if we choose a gauge condition linear in ai this determinant becomes
independent of the elds, and can be absorbed into a normalization factor. the integration
over ai then yields a -function for x i . when this -function is implemented the elds
x i become independent of the coordinates {x} on m . hence the casimir functions are
constants. the constant modes of the casimir coordinates x i
0 count the symplectic leaves.
the path integral is now

(3.43)

note that we have now arrived at an almost closed expression for the partition function for
the poisson-sigma model, i.e. all the functional integrations have been performed.

4 su(2) yang-mills theory

to make further progress we consider the special case where the poisson manifold n = r3,
and the poisson structure is linear: p ij = cij
k x k. the quadratic casimir operator is c(x) =

pi x ix i. if we use this casimir operator in the classical action (3.7) we may integrate out

the x i elds to obtain the action for the two-dimensional yang-mills theory. if we omit the
casimir term in the action the same procedure yields the topological bf-theory.

17

because of the jacobi identity the structure constants cij

k dene a lie algebra structure on
the dual space g of n . for this reason the linear poisson structure is also called a lie-poisson
structure on n . we are here interested in the case where the lie algebra is three-dimensional,
and the structure constants are those of the group su (2). the poisson structure is degenerate
and the symplectic leaves are two dimensional spheres characterized, in the casimir-darboux
coordinates, by their radius x i
0 . weinstein [18] has shown that the symplectic leaves of a
linear poisson structure are the co-adjoint orbits of the corresponding compact, connected
lie group g of g. by a theorem of kirillov these orbits can in turn be identied with the
irreducible unitary representations of g [19].

these considerations can be used to further reduce the expression for the path integral.
consider the homotopy classes of the maps x  : m  s(x i
0 ). the hopf theorem tells us
that the mappings f, g : m  s(x i
0 ) are homotopic if and only if the degree of the mapping
f is the same as the degree of g. this means that the sum over the homotopy classes of the
maps [x ] can be expressed as a sum over the degrees n = deg[x ]:

x[x ]

 xnz

(4.1)

for a map f : x  y , where x and y are k-dimensional oriented manifolds and  a k-form
on y , the degree of the mapping is given by

using this formula yields:

zx

f  = deg[f ]zy

 .

zm

 dx dx  = nzs

s(x i

0 ) ,

(4.2)

(4.3)

where s(x i
function of eq. (3.43)

0 ) is the symplectic form on the corresponding leaf s. this gives for the partition

z = z

dx i

det(cid:18) (x)
0 xnz
 exp{ nzs

x  p (x i

det1/2(cid:16)p (x i

s(x i

am c(x i

(4.4)

the sum over n yields a periodic -function:

z = z

dx i

0 xnz

det(cid:18) (x)

zs

x  p (x i
0 )  n

s(x i

0 )(cid:19)0(m )
 exp(



the -function says that the symplectic leaves must be integral. by the identication of the
leaves with the co-adjoint orbits, the orbits must also be integral. the fact that the orbits
are integral reduces the number of the co-adjoint orbits to a countable set, which we label by
o().

det1/2(cid:16)p (x i

0 )(cid:17)1(m )

am c(x i

0 )).

(4.5)

18

we now consider the two determinants in the path integral. we choose the unitary
gauge (x ) = x , so that (x)/x  = 
 , and the two determinants have the same
form. the restiction of the scalar elds to the casimir-darboux coordinates x i corresponds
to the restriction of the scalar elds to the invariant cartan subalgebra considered by blau
and thompson in [20], so we may adopt their argumentation concerning the powers to which
the determinants occur for a manifold with euler characteristic (m ). the result is a factor

det(p (x i

0 ))(m ).

(4.6)

the determinant of a mapping equals the volume of the image of that mapping, hence
0 )) corresponds to the symplectic volume of the leaf, which we

the determinant det(p (x i
denote by vol(s(x i

0 )). the path integral then takes the form:

z = z

dx i

0 xnz

vol(s(x i

0 ))(m ) 
zs

s(x i

0 )  n

 exp(

1


am c(x i

0 )).

(4.7)

implementing the -function by integrating over x i
comes a sum over the set o() of the integral orbits:

0 the sum over the mapping degrees be-

vol(s(x i

0 ))(m ) exp(

1


am c(x i

0 )).

(4.8)

z = xo()

because of the identication of the integral orbits with the irreducible unitary representations
this leads to a sum over the representations. a special form of the character formula of
kirillov [21] says that the symplectic volume of the co-adjoint orbit equals the dimension
of the corresponding irreducible unitary representation. so the nal form of the partition
function is

d()(m ) exp(

1


am c()),

z = x

(4.9)

where  denotes the irreducible unitary representation corresponding to the co-adjoint orbit,
and d() is the dimension of this representation. this is exactly the partition function for
the two-dimensional yang-mills theory [13]. when we omit the casimir term in the action
we get just a sum over the dimensions of the representations, which is the correct result for
the bf-theory, see e.g. [20].

5 conclusions and outlook

the poisson-sigma model is more than a unied framework for dierent topological and semi-
topological eld theories. due to its reformulation of the degrees of freedom of the theories
in terms of the coordinates of a poisson manifold it achieves a description in terms of the
natural variables of general dynamical systems. gauge theories, which are characterized by
singular lagrangians, cannot in general be described in terms of symplectic manifolds; the
foliation which is characteristic for poisson manifolds is neccesary.

the advantages of such a description of these eld theories is at least twofold. first, it
allows one to discuss the quantization of the classical eld theory by a direct application

19

of the techniques of deformation quantization. second, for integrable systems the general
dynamical concepts of integrability may be utilized in order to reduce the partition function
of the theory.

to some extent the above remarks are illustrated in the present work. the use of casimir-
darboux coordinates allowed essential simplications. in section (4) we achieved a full reduc-
tion of the path integral in a special case through the use of concepts and theorems involving
the symmetries of general dynamical sytems.

we believe that further research will uncover ways of utilizing these structures even more
thoroughly. the techniques used here should in principle be applicable in more general
situations than the particular case we considered in section (4). we also hope to be able
to treat more general manifolds. this would allow in particular a more direct comparison
with canonical quantization procedures. finally, as already discussed in the introduction, an
understanding of the mechanisms active in the general case should allow the resolution of
problems encountered in particular eld theories.
