abstract

we calculate the chiral anomaly in the neighbourhood of the xed point space mh which
is constructed by the group action of a discrete symmetry h on a compact manifold m.
the feynman diagrams approach for the corresponding supersymmetric quantum mechanical
system with twisted boundary conditions is used. the result we derive in this way agrees with
the generalization of the ordinary index theorem (the g-index theorem) on the spin complex.

1 introduction

techniques of supersymmetric quantum mechanics have been extensively used as tools to com-
pute chiral and trace anomalies of n-dimensional quantum eld theories coupled to external
gravitons and yang-mills elds [1]. the reason is that cumbersome trace calculations in n-
dimensions are performed much easier in this way than in the fujikawas scheme [2] where one
has to evaluate products of  matrices.

for chiral anomalies the partition function receives contributions from periodic bosonic
coordinates and the projection operator (1)f replaces the antiperiodic boundary conditions
for the fermions with periodic ones.
it is worth noting that chiral anomalies due to their
topological nature are insensitive to the method used for calculating them in contrast to the
trace anomalies which are not.

in this article we introduce twisted boundary conditions for bosons and fermions induced
by automorphic maps of the base manifold. for convenience we consider zn as the discrete
isometry group. the twisted chiral anomaly will be given by the trace:

an(chiral) = lim
0

t r(cid:16)(1)f pe 
h h(cid:17)

(1)

where (1)f is the 4n analogue of 5, f is the one-dimensional fermion number, p is a projec-
tion operator which selects those states of the total hilbert space that remain invariant under
the group action and h is the n = 1 supersymmetric hamiltonian. the paths of the points
that belong to the group invariant subspace dominate in the functional integral. away from
the xed point space the corresponding contributions are exponentially suppressed.

the extra contribution to the chiral anomaly comes from the vacuum expectation value of
a vertex that couples the complex zero modes of periodic fermions with the complex bosonic

quantum uctuations. writing then the chiral anomaly as a double sum of the relevant twisted
worldline graphs all satisfying the same boundary conditions, we recover the standard result of
the literature [3, 4, 5].

2 the group action and the hilbert space

we consider a compact riemannian manifold m (which might be curved with nontrivial metric)
of even dimension dimm = 4n with coordinates described by the real bosonic elds x( ). in
the supersymmetric quantum mechanics we also have majorana fermions living on the sections
of the pullback of the tangent bundle of the tangent space tm with dimtm = 4n. when our
base manifold has a discrete isometry h  g then there is a submanifold mh (possibly of non
vanishing dimension) that remains invariant under the corresponding group action. we may
also assume that the manifold m is kahler equipped with a complex structure j preserved
under the action of h:

where the asterisk represents push-forward of the vectors.
decomposes into at complex bundles then the real dimension at a point p of mh is:

h  j = j  h

(2)
if the normal bundle nm(mh)

dimmh|p = m = 4n  2s.

(3)
the above constraint implies that mh is of even dimension. the specic choice for the dimen-
sion of the base manifold is implied by the existence of the untwisted chiral anomaly only in
4n-dimensions. note that we may use for mh the same j as that used for m.
the rotation:

let h be an orientation preserving map which generates the zn transformation realised by

  x2i( )
x2i1( ) !    cos i  sin i

sin i

cos i !  x2i( )

x2i1( ) !

(4)

where i = 1, . . . , dimnm(mh)/2, i = 2
ui is an orthogonal matrix it can be diagonalized by a unitary matrix mi:

n ki, ki = 0, . . . , n  1 and ui satises u n

i = 1. since

from which one obtains:

miuim 

i = ui,diag

ui,diag =   gki 0

gki !

0

(5)

(6)

with g = e2i/n 1 . in this way the eigenvalues of ui fall into two subsets ngkio and ngkio.

thus, adopting complex notation for the bosons on the normal bundle we impose the fol-

lowing twisted boundary conditions:

1the explicit form of mi is: mi =(cid:18) 

i  (cid:19) with the condition that kk = 12 .

  x i
xi ! =

2   x2i + ix2i1

x2i  ix2i1 !    gki 0

gki !  x i
xi !

(7)

and similar twisted conditions hold for the fermions on the tangent space. thus the base
manifold coordinates split into the following set:

x = (xl, x i, xi)

(8)
where xl, l = 1,   , m describe the xed point manifold. these coordinates can be decomposed
into background trajectories obeying the boundary condition xl
bg( = 0) and a
quantum uctuating part with ql( = 1) = ql( = 0) = 0. on the other hand the x i, xi,
i,i = 1,   , (4n  m)/2 describe the manifold normal to mg and the appearance of twisted
boundary conditions does not allow the existence of a classical part but permits only a quantum
part (denoted by qi, qi respectively).

bg( = 1) = xl

recalling the standard lore or orbifold theories [6], each ki-sector (one for each conjugacy
2. the total hilbert

class in the group) has its own mode expansion and hilbert space hki
space is the direct sum of hki:

the physical hilbert space hi
all hki:

hi

tot = n

ki=1hki.

(9)

phys consists of states that remain invariant under the action of

with the projection operator dened by:

hi
phys = p ihi

p i =

xki=1

(10)

(11)

notice that p i is indeed a projection operator since ( p i)2 = p i and hkj

p i = p i.

3 interactions and propagators

the total interaction langrangian density decomposes into an untwisted and a twisted part:

(12)

the rst term corresponds to the interaction on the base manifold while the second describes
the interaction on the normal bundle.

the propagator for bosons that move along the bres r2 of the normal bundle is:
2in the non-abelian case the twisted sectors should be labeled by the conjugacy classes ci of the group g.
the projection operator is replaced by p = pi
g{h} where the centralizer ni is dened by ni =
{g|h  ci : [g, h] = 0} and the action of any g  ni on {h} is dened by g{h} = (g{h}, l1gl1

and all bosons are twisted in the same way with 
 ki(  ). the combinatorial
factors (l  1)! and 2l1 stand for the ways one can contract l vertices and two q elds at l
vertices respectively. the multiple integral can be evaluated using successively:

ki(  ) =

ki(2  3) d2 = ki(1  3),

where ki = ki
n . if we compare this result with the one derived from the untwisted sector [7] we
observe that iki,l is no longer zero for odd values of l. to demonstrate this consider the case
iki,1 then:

iki,1 = z 0

where f (z) = (z)
(z) and (z) is the well known gamma function (see appendix for details).
on the other hand the propagator is equipped with a metric which upon contraction with the
riemann tensor provides us with a vanishing result, so again only even values of l contribute.
the twisted chiral anomaly is then propotional to:

this expression is in agreement with the one found by eguchi [3] and witten [4, 5].

5 conclusions

we have extended the feynman diagrams formalism developed by the authors [7, 8] to calculate
chiral anomalies when twisted boundary conditions are present. the starting point was the
expression that incorporates all the q-loop contributions to the chiral anomaly in which all
bosons were subjected to identical boundary conditions.

a complete and meticulous examination of this problem would require steps similar to those
presented in [7, 8] but this task is postponed for a future investigation. it is belevied our result

where a is a constant. the contribution iki,1 can be rewritten as:

the zeta function has the following asymptotic form when s  1:
