the orbifold cft dual to string theory on ads3s3 allows a construction of gravita-

by a lie algebra constructed from chiral primaries and their cft conjugates. the lead-

ing terms in the algebra at large n are derived from the computation of chiral primary

correlation functions. the algebra is argued to determine the dynamics of the theory,

its representations provide free and interacting hamiltonians for chiral primaries. this

dynamics is seen to be given by an eective one plus one dimensional eld theory. the

introduction

in the context of the ads/cft duality [1,2,3] we began in [4] (hereafter referred to
as i ) a construction of elements of supergravity on ads3  s3 based on a simple orbifold
conformal eld theory with target space sn (t 4) or sn (k3). the novel feature of the

emerging gravitational theory is a stringy exclusion principle ([5]) which follows from the

cft.

we argued that this exclusion principle implies a role for a non-commutative space-

time. similar aspects of non-commutativity in closed string backgrounds were also found

recently in [6]. the precise form of non-commutative spacetime suggested in i was
su (2)q  suq(1, 1) with q = e
n +1 . one way to arrive at the value of q was geometri-
cal. a deformation of the s3 sphere to suq(2) implies, using the special properties of
quantum groups at roots of unity, that kk reduction on the quantum sphere leads to a

i

cuto in the spins of kk states. using the match of kk states with generating chiral

primaries [7], the cuto on such chiral primaries in the cft was analyzed and shown to
be in agreement with the above suq(2)  suq(1, 1) spacetime. another way to arrive at
the same value of q was dynamical as in similar work in earlier matrix models [8]. an

slq(2) subalgebra was identied in the algebra generated by the chiral primaries and their

conjugates. this makes it clear that the parameter 1/n governing the non-commutativity

of space-time is identical to the parameter measuring the strength of interactions, so that

the emerging model of non-commutative gravity here does not involve doing classical grav-

ity on a non-commutative spacetime followed by quantum eects being turned as another

parameter is being varied. a review of ideas in the general subject of non-commutative

space-times in the gravitational context, with extensive references is given in [9].

the techniques of collective eld theory allow, in general, the construction of spacetime

actions starting from the algebra of sn invariant variables. since the short representations
related to chiral primaries have been matched with gravity on ads3  s3, it is instructive
to focus on the dynamics associated with these representations and their cft conjugates.

we describe a central role played by a lie algebra of observables associated to the chiral

primaries. the simplest representations of this lie algebra involve the fock space generated

by a certain class of chiral primaries ( those which are generators of the chiral ring ). one

wants to focus on these representations rst because they include states created by the

graviton, whose propagation and dynamics is of interest. we describe this dynamics in

terms of two dimensional eld theory. this represents the simplest representation of the

1

algebra. other reps. will be of relevance when we go beyond chiral primaries and study

more stringy states [10,11,12].

the paper is organized as follows. in ch.2, we summarize the eld content and basic

symmetries of the cft, and then describe the computation of some exact correlation

functions involving twisted sector chiral primaries. in ch.3 concentrating on the untwisted

sector we review the algebra of observables given by the creation-annihilation operators

and their commutators. we study a fock space representation of this algebra where a

creation operator is associated to each generating chiral primary. we use a coherent state

description for the fock space and derive, using the correlation functions of the chiral

primaries, a formula for a symplectic form ( equivalently the kinetic term of a lagrangian

) on the space of coherent states. we also obtain a formula for the hamiltonian in this

coherent state representation. we outline how these exact formulae can be developed in
a 1

n expansion into a realization of the algebra in terms of free oscillators.

in section

4, we describe the algebra when twisted sector operators are taken into account. we
describe the leading terms in a systematic 1

n free eld representation of the algebra. we
study the form of the hamiltonian, and observe that free eld realizations which dier in

detailed form, lead to the possibility of a quadratic hamiltonian and an interacting one.

we write a formula for the interacting hamiltonian and observe similarities with other

gravity-gauge theory correspondences, which suggest that the dynamics of chiral primaries
can be understood as a reduction of ads  s backgrounds to a 1 + 1 dimesnional system
having some universal features. in section 5 we turn to nite n eects, like the stringy

exclusion principle, where the free eld realizations start to break down. we outline a

non-trivial property of the nite n lie algebra which follows from independently known

facts about the cohomology of the instanton moduli spaces. we return to the picture of a
non-commutative spacetime emphasized in i. the q-deformed symmetry suq(2|1, 1) of the
q-spacetime proposed in i, is seen to govern the structure of the fusion rules implicit in the

correlation functions of section 2. while i focused on the quantum spacetime interpretation

of the single-particle states, we begin a study of multi-particle states in this franework.

finally we study the properties of the algebra and look for the value of l0 where deviations

from free eld behaviour rst show up.

we conclude with a summary and outline some future directions.

2. orbifold conformal field theory. field content and symmetries

in this section we will discuss the eld content and the symmetries of the scft on
symmetric product sn (x), where n = q1q5 and x is either t 4 or k3 . it is known that
this scft has (4,4) superconformal symmetry in both cases. we will work with t 4 for

simplicity. many of the results extend simply to k3.

the eld content of the theory is: 4n real free bosons x a a

representing the coordinates
of the torus and their superpartners 4n free fermions  a
i , where i = 1, .., n , ,  =  are
the spinorial s3 indices, and a, a = 1, 2 are the spinorial indices on t 4. using the relation
between the fermi elds:  a  =  a =  ab b, the eld content of the theory is
determined to be 4n real free bosons and 2n dirac free fermions, giving a central charge

where  a is the left moving component of the coresponding fermion, and the ,  ab
are used to raise and lower the spinorial indices. the lowest modes of this currents
{l0,1, ga
0 } will generate together to their right counterparts the su (2|1, 1)l 
 1
su (2|1, 1)r symmetry which is mapped in the ads/cf t correspondence to the superi-
sometries of the ads3  s3.
in addition, it is possible to construct other symmetries
commuting with the previous set and related to global t 4 rotations, and they are given by

the following currents:

(2.4)

and similar expressions for the right-movers. this symmetry acts non-trivially on the space

of chiral primaries.

although the underlying cft on t 4 is free, non-trivial sn invariant chiral primary
operators can be constructed in correspondence with conjugacy classes of sn [13][14][15].
the basic twist operators for n free bosons: xi, i = 1..n, are dened by the ope :

xi(z)(1..n)(0) = z

1

n 1e 2i

n i (1..n)(0) + ..

(2.5)

they impose the boundary conditions :

xi(z e2i, z e2i) = xi+1(z, z), i = 1..n  1, xn(z e2i, z e2i) = x1(z, z)

(2.6)

the general twist operator for a general conjugacy class of sn is obtained by its decom-
postion into cycles. we may dene a twisted sector vacuum by |(1..n)i = (1..n)(0)|0i.
over this vacuum we can write the following mode expansion:

xi(z) = 

i
n x

m

m e 2i

n imz m

n 1

(2.7)

where [m, n] = mm+n,0 and m|(1..n)i = 0 for m  0. the expression above can be
generalized to any other primary operator constructed from xi, the only dierence being
that in the exponent of z, 1 is replaced by the corresponding conformal dimension. this

shows that the sn invariant operators have nonsingular ope with the twist operator. the
dimension of the twist operator can be calculated by computing the energy momentum
tensor in the state |(1..n)i and it is (for one boson, left-mover):

(1..n) =

1

(n

)

(2.8)

for our system, we will bosonize rst the fermions by introducing 1,2

i (z)+
1,2
i (z), the nal theory being one of 6n free bosons and we will construct the chiral
primaries using these bosons :

i (z, z) = 1,2

(2.9)

(2.10)

for right-movers. using these expressions,the su (2)l currents are given in the standard
way:

let us construct the zn twist operators which can be used to build sn invariant
chiral primaries by averaging over sn . these twist operators play a distinguished role

4

in the chiral ring in the sense that they can be used to generate the rest by using the
in the correspondence with gravity in ads3  s3 they are in one-one
correspondence with single particle states. these vertex operators are written in terms of

ring structure.

where (1) represents the one cycle containing only i = 1. we will also construct vertex

operators out of the simple twists which will correspond to the nontrivial chiral elds

associated with the twist. for that we consider the cycle (1..n) and we dene the following

sn invariant 6 dimensional vector observables (left and right) :

let us consider now the following eld which consists of the twist operator for all 6

elds and having momenta along the 2 extra  dimensions:

(1..n)(z, z) = eipi

(2.14)

the dimensions of this eld is ( n1
2 ) and its charges can be shown to be equal to the
dimensions. in comparison with the formulae in i, we have extracted and made explicit

2 , n1

the u (1) charges by exhibiting exponentials of the bosons , leaving a twist operator for

both the  and x. this eld will be used to construct the sn invariant chiral primary
o(0,0)
(z, z) [5]. a more precise way to write which we will further generalize to the other
cases is to write:

n

o(0,0)

(1..n)(z, z) = ei(klyl(z)+kryr(z))(1..n)(, x)(z, z)

(2.15)

where kl = (0, 0, 0, 0, n1

momenta in 6 dimensions. the dimensions of a eld of type (2.15) is given by the following

(2.16)

and for our ks we obtain the dimensions above. for the charge we can read it from

the momenta on only the two extra dimensions, the twist being uncharged. in order to

construct all the other chiral elds we will combine the construction in untwisted sector

with the twist. we will focus then on the following construction:

oa
(1..n)(z, z)  oa

(1)(z, z) o(0,0)

(1..n)(z, z)

(2.17)

where a index takes care of the spinorial indices which already fully appear at untwisted

level. we give for these operators a construction similar to (2.15) where what makes the

distinction between them is the value for the momenta. this construction will be further

justied by looking to the ope of chiral elds.

we will focus further on scalar chiral primaries, namely those elds coresponding to

from the bosonization 1,2 (the dimension and the charge for this operators are equal):

we will dene below the precise relation between the on and the corresponding o(1..n)

in a general context. for this let us consider the following basis of forms leaving on the
target space x and spanning its h (1,1)(x); we will denote them as r
aa where r counts the
forms (for example, r = 1..4 for t 4, and r = 1..20 for k3)) and a, a = 1, 2 and they are

x indices. using this forms and summing over all permutations, it is possible to describe

the scalar chiral primaries up to a normalization constant which will be determined in the

next section. we write here the full expression for this operators:

we will compute in this section the ope of two chiral primary operators focusing

only on the constant appearing in front of the resulting single-particle chiral primary

operator. from this we are able to write their three-point correlation functions. using

the denition of the chiral primaries, we see that there are some restrictions coming from

charge conservation, from the fact that except the twist operator, these operators are

fermionic in nature and from sn multiplication law. it is straightforward to observe that

we will be interested from the permutation point of view in two kind of processes:

1) the joining of two cycles overlapping on only one of their components giving a

longer permutation, which gives correlation functions between elds which have (p, q) form
indices as follows : i)(0, 0) + (0, 0)  (0, 0), ii)(0, 0) + r  r, iii) (0, 0) + (2, 2)  (2, 2),
iv)s + r  (2, 2),

2) the joining of two cycles overlapping on two components giving a longer permuta-

tion, which gives correlation functions of the form: (0, 0) + (0, 0)  (2, 2).

we will rst study the processes listed above on the components of the chiral primaries

and then we will sum over all permutation to recover the sn invariance. using the notation

of [15] we will denote the left-moving twist operator having momenta as o(1..n)(k) where k

7

is the momenta and we assume that they are normalized in the sense that their two-point

takes the following form:

h oh(k1)()og(k2)(0)i = h,g1k1,k2

(2.22)

using the same method, we will derive in appendix the ope of a twist (1..n) having

momenta kn and the twist (n n + 1) having momenta k2 involving only the twist (1..n + 1)
(corresponding to the rst kind of process) the result being:

o(n n+1)(k2)(u) o(1..n)(kn)(0) =

c(2, n|n + 1; k2, kn)

zn+12n

(o(1..n+1)(k2 + kn)(0)+

(2.23)

+ o(1..n1 n+1 n)(k2 + kn)(0)),

since we are dealing with operators which are chiral primaries one has the exponent of z
being 0, and the c(2, n|n + 1; k2, kn) are determined in the appendix. we will write here
the expression for c(2, n|n + 1; k2, kn) and we will see what they are in our processes (only
left movers):

o(n n+1)(u) o(1..n)(0) =

o(n n+1)(u) o1

(1..n)(0) =

o(n n+1)(u) o12

(1..n)(0) =

(1..n+1 n)(0)),

(2.24)

)

2 (o12

(1..n+1)(0) + o12

(1..n+1 n)(0)).

the method also gives us ope for all the other cases involved in the list above case 1) for

a 2 twist and an n twist overlapping over only one component. knowing that the total

twist is the product of the left and right moving twist and excluding out of the ope those

cases when the left and right twists do not coincide we see that the result of the ope is

essentially the square of what we have in the previous equations. we can also observe that

an extrapolation to the n = 1 case, when the twist is nothing than the identity operator

results in the following ope:

o(1 2)(u) +a(0) = oa

o(1 2)(u) +1 +2

(1..n)(0) =

(12)(0),
1
2

o12

(12)(0).

(2.25)

the equations above show that it is enough to gure out the ope for the twist elds

and then generalize to the other chiral primary elds. we will use from this point the cft

rules to compute the ope for any twist operators overlapping on only one component of

8

the permutations. what we will do is to compute the ope for 3 twist of type (1..n  1),
(n  1 n) and (n..n + k  1) at dierent locations in the complex plane, and by making
dierent limits and an induction process we obtain the following results including now the

right moving twist:

o(n..n+k1)(u, u) o(1..n)(0) =

n + k  1

2 n k

(o(1..n+k1)(0) + ..),

(2.26)

where the dots are for the eld corresponding to the other permutation obtained by mul-

tiplying the two permutations. using the equations above we derive the ope for the

processes 1) and we list them here:

(1..n)(0) =

(1..n)(0) =

o(n..n+k1)(u, u) or
o(n..n+k1)(u, u) o12,12
or
(n..n+k1)(u, u) os

(or
(1..n+k1)(0) + ..),
n

2 k (n + k  1)

2

(o12,12

(1..n+k1)(0) + ..),

(1..n+k1)(0) + ..).
note that if we extrapolate the above expressions for the case n = 1 we have:

n + k  1

(1..n)(0) =

r  s(o12,12

o(1..k)(u, u) or

(1)(0) =

o(1..k)(u, u) o12,12

(1)

(0) =

2 k

(1..k)(0) + ..),

(or
2 k2 (o12,12

1

(1..k)(0) + ..).

(2.27)

(2.28)

where for the denition of untwisted operators we use (2.12).

in addition there is the 2) process which we will focus now on. using the above rules

there is a single ope which has to be gured out and this is the one involving only two

twists for the same 2 cycle (overlapping of 2), and then the result can be extended to the

other permutations using the known ope from the previous list and an induction process.

consider the ope of 3 operators: the twists and the one formed from all 4 adjoints of

fermions and no twist. in the limit when we put together the twist and the fermions this

process is nothing else than the one used for normalization of the twist of length 2; in the

limit when one puts together the twists and then the fermions and ask the question on

what kind of operator would give this result one is led to consider the following ope:

o(12)(u, u) o(12)(0) = 12 1 2(0)

the nal needed ope is then:

o(1..n)(u, u)o(n n1..n+k2)(0) =

1

n k (n + k  3)

(o12,12

(1..n..n+k2)(0) + ..),

where by n we mean that n is missing in this permutation. we have at this moment the

2 and 3-point functions for all elds which we will use in constructing the chiral elds.

(2.29)

(2.30)

2.2. correlation functions of chiral primaries.

in this section we will put back the sums over permutations with appropriate normal-

ization factors, which together with the 3 point functions deduced in the previous section
will allow us to write the full 3-point functions for the chiral primaries. for o(0,0)
:

we have

n

o(0,0)

n

(z, z) = const. x
hsn

oh(1..n)h1(z, z).

(2.31)

the two point function for individual twists is given (2.22) with a constant to be deter-

mined.

h2(1..n)h1

(0)i .

(2.32)

because the 2-point function for twists is normalized to 1, the sums will be rearranged in

other two sums: a sum over all permutations and a sum on only those permutation which

leave a cycle invariant. the sum over all permutation will give a factor of n ! whereas
the second sum will give a factor of (n  n)! n leading to the expressions already listed in
equation (2.21).

for the three-point functions we will use the normalized chiral primaries operators
and we will also show how one can determine them for only three o(0,0) and then list the

full results for all the other cases. the conservation law for the r-symmetry suggest that

the only possibility is having only the process listed in 1) namely a cycle having length
n + k  1, one having length n and one having k and the individual permutations have to
overlapp on one entry:

h o(0,0)

(0)i,

(2.33)

where the const. comes from the normalization of each chiral primary eld.the individual

terms which appear in the sum are nonzero only if:

h1(1..n + k  1)1h1
and in this case they are all equal to the expressions derived in the previous section.

1 h2(n..n + k  1)h1

2 h3(1..n)h1

3 = 1

by rearranging the previous permutation equation it is possible to compute the sums,

namely:

(1..n + k  1)1h1

1 h2((n..n + k  1)h1
10

2 h3(1..n)h1

3 h2)h1

2 h1 = 1.

then the result will be a n ! summing over h1, a factor of (n  k)!/(n  k  n + 1)!
coming from the possibilities of constructing a long permutation out of 2 small permutation,

a factor of (n  n)! n coming from the sum over h1
and a factor of (n  n  k + 1)! (n + k  1) coming from h1
n + k  1 cycle invariant. in addition there is a factor of 2 coming from the two possibility
of multiplying permutations in individual three-point functions. we will list below the

we notice a certain degree of universality: all the three point functions exibited above
for the case of ads3 have the same form factor pnk(n + k) as the three point functions
of chiral primaries in other ads examples for example [16,17,18]. we will have further

comments on this universal behaviour and its meaning in subsequent discussion. in the
future sections, we will denote as a(p,q)
and by ap,q

n the modes p o(n,p,q)

o(n,p,q), of op,q

n (z, z)

n the conjugates.

3. algebra of observables and the lagrangian - untwisted sector

generated by the exact single particle creation and annihilation operators ap,q

at the heart of the disscusion begun in i is consideration of the commutator algebra
n )+
( with the cuos on n as described in i ). these operators represent exact eigenstates of

n and (ap,q

the hamiltonian and the full algebra is then by denition a spectrum generating one.

we should emphasize the analogy of this with previous large algebras appearing in related

contexts: the w-algebra of the matrix model [19,20] the bps algebras of [21], and extended

12

algebras mentioned in [22]. an interesting example of a spectrum generating algebra in

semiclassical ads gravity is discussed in [23].

in this section we concentrate on the simplest, zero twist sector of the theory.

it

represents a reduction of cft to a fermionic quantum mechanical system. we describe

for this the algebra of chiral primaries and the manner in which this algebra denes the

interacting lagrangian. the collective [24] interacting theory emerges as a representation

of the algebra in terms of invariants. the relevance of the algebra on the poisson (phase

space) structure of the theory will also be elaborated.

let us begin from the operators representing the chiral primaries a(p,q)

1

and their

conjugates ap,q

1 . the procedure to construct the associated super-lie algebra is to con-

sider the ( graded ) commutators of the conjugates with the chiral primaries. the terms

appearing on the rhs of the commutators are then commuted with the chiral primaries

and their conjugates, and with each other until closure is achieved. this clearly gener-

ates a nite dimensional super-lie algebra of which the creation-anihilation operators and

the hamiltonian are members. a set of mutually commuting hermitian operators in this

algebra are

(3.1)

the indices , ,  above run from 1 to 4 and we have 4 operators in the rst line, 6

in the second line, and 4 in the third line. we should add to this an operator e which

commutes with everything, and which appears, for example, in the commutator of a an

operator a(1,0)
1

and its conjugate. note that the procedure of successive commutations of

the a1 operators do not generate terms involving a product of four fermions with their
conjugates.

the other generators of the lie algebra include of course the chiral primaries and

conjugates, along with others generated by the commutations. we also have the following

some of these operators have already been included in the description of the cartan
above. the operator of the form ()4()4 does not appear in the the commutators. let us
call this lie super-algebra ginv, and the corresponding supergroup ginv. if we nevertheless
include it we get a superlagebra which has rank 16 and is closely related to the cliord
algebra which is in turn related to su (16) 1. this suggests that the lie super-algebra is
actually u (8|8).

3.1. coherent state representation

we derive in this section the action governing the dynamics of the chiral primaries

for the untwisted sector and then comment on how it is extended to the full set of chiral

primaries and beyond. consider then the simplied model obtained by reducing the theory

to a quantum mechanical version with the algebra described above. we deal then with the

following set of operators as annihilation operators:

 

i

;  = 1..4, i = 1..n,

(3.3)

1 we thank j. gervais for this remark.

14

where  is the su (2) index,  is the t 4 index and we also have the adjoints of these as
creation operators. we also focus on the chiral primaries only meaning that we consider

only highest weight states under the action of the su (2), namely (+), and for now on we

will also drop this index. the hamiltonian of the system (the one involving only highest

weight under su (2)) is considered to be the hamiltonian of a free system of fermions:

(3.5)

the idea of the construction is to build them using only the highest weight operators under

su (2) and sn invariant combination of operators. the dimension and the charge of the

operators are equal to the number of fermion operators.

let us study now how we write an action involving only these special set of operators.

for this we can use the technique of [25]. it consists in introducing a basis of coherent

states using the sn invariant operators already derived and from the expression for the

partition function we derive the hamiltonian and the symplectic form which governs the

dynamics of the collective variables. the rst step is to derive the measure which will be
use together with the coherent basis (a, a) as:

(b, b) =< 0|e

b ab

1 eb ab

1|0 >

(3.6)

here we have taken the index b to run over all the 15 chiral primaries of the invariant

sector. this can be computed using coherent state techniques to nd :

(a, a) = (z(, ))n ,

(3.7)

and the dots stand for terms of lower order in 1

for determining the representation of the hamiltonian in ,  we evaluate its matrix

elements in the coherent basis. in our case it is suitable to evaluate the following:

z[, , ] =< 0|e

b ab

1 e(l0+ l0)eab

1b|0 >

(3.10)

using the expression for the hamiltonian (3.4)and coherent state tehniques we compute

the following expression:

z[, , ] =

z[(1 +

) , (1 +

) ; (1 + 1/2)2 , (1 + 1/2)2 ;

(3.11)

(1 + 1/2)3 ; (1 + 1/2)3 ; (1 + 1/2)4 ; (1 + 1/2)4]

we can write then the average for the hamiltonian as:

h(, )

(3.12)

in the last line we wrote the rst quadratic term, the other being also quadratic in  but

for the remaining indices. noting the expression for the tilde variables (eq.3.9) one has a

sequence of cubic,quartic and higher terms which are explicitely determined by the above

representation .

using the equations above we can now derive the lagrangian governing the dynamics

of the collective elds we introduced:

l(, ) = l(, )  h(, ),

(3.13)

l is determined from the above measure (3.7),(3.8) by

l(, ) = (cid:2)


t


 +


t


 +



t



 b +



t



 (cid:3) log (, ), (3.14)

and it is linear in time derivatives. its expression gives the poisson structure in the phase

space of , . for the other part of the lagrangian h, we use the expression we computed

in (3.12).

this coherent state technique can also be used to give a free eld realization of the

algebra of observables in a 1/n expansion which reproduces correlation functions involving

a small number of operators compared to n . to convert to free elds we have to nd
variables which convert the lagrangian l(, ) into l(a, a) = a a

t . this can be done
in a systematic large n expansion and reproduces correlators involving a small number

of insertions compared to n . when the number of insertions becomes comparable to

n , eects like the stringy exclusion principle become important. the properties of the

measure  then show properties qualitatively diferent from free elds. for example

(cid:0)


 


 

(cid:1)n=1

(, ) = 0

(3.15)

the coherent state technique oers a complementary insight into the exclusion principle.

it is related to the fact that the symplectic manifold generated by the action of elements

of ginv on the fock vacuum has a non-trivial symplectic form which cannot be globally
brought to the form  = pi dpidqi. this phenomenon was emphasized in simpler models
of large n in [25]. we expect along the lines of i, that a transformation valid for nite n

can be done using q-oscillators at roots of unity.

17

4. algebra of observables - twisted sector

the strategy for dening a lie algebra associated with the single particle chiral pri-

maries by taking successive commutators clearly works when we include the twisted sectors

as well. some elements were described in i. here we will discuss further properties of the

algebra, and its representations in terms of free elds. as we go from the zero twist to the

twisted sector the the creation-anihilation operators aquire an additional index n, which is

reected in the commutator algebra. the commutators also become more complex, but are

computable using cft techniques. the general form of the terms are highly constrained

by conservation of l0, j0, and the sn symmetry. the n dependences can be obtained

by sn combinatorics. the precise coecients are related to computations of correlation

functions of the kind done in section 2.

consider the class of chiral primary operators a0,0

n dened at the end of section
2, denoted here an. by elementary commutator manipulations, followed by contour
integrals, we derived in i an equation which reduces in the large n limit to

[an, a

n] = 1 +

n n

[ x

(4.1)

we are keeping only the leading terms in the combinatoric factors, e.g (cid:0)n
n(cid:1) has been
approximated by n n, to demonstrate the key features of the large n counting. each

operator is normalized to 1.

we will now consider the form of commutators involving dierent chiral primaries
m2. for this we will need to discuss commutators of the chiral building

in the above equation mi  tmi where tmi denotes the set of permutations in sn which
have one cycle of length mi and remaining cycles of length 1. we are not being specic

about the order of magnitude of c in the large n expansion in the above equation, but

we will cure that in a moment. we will assume that m2 is larger than m1. we can

further decompose the sum over 3 by specifying the number of non-trivial cycles ( of

length greater than 1 ) in the permutation 3. when 3 belongs to a permutation with
k non-trivial cycles of lengths (n1, n2,    nk) we say 3  tn1,n2,nk , and we write 3 as

18

note that we could have used a basis where the product operators are just products of the

generating sn invariant generating chiral primaries. for example we could have written

x

o1 o2

1tn1 ,2tn2

(4.4)

rather than the sums associated with conjugacy classes as in (4.3). in the sum in (4.4) the

terms 1 and 2 can involve elements which overlap while they do not involve overlapping
elements in (4.3). the advantage of writing the algebra in the form above is that the leading

coecient can be read o directly from the 3-point functions that have been computed in

section 2.

another noteworthy point in (4.3) is that after correct normalization the terms involv-

ing permutations with higher numbers of non-trivial cycles are sub-leading in the large n
expansion. this means that by restricting attention to leading powers of 1
n we can dene
appropriate contractions of the lie algebra of interest which can be simpler than the

exact lie algebra and may be investigated in connection with the qualitative properties

such as the exclusion principle and the related properties of correlation functions which

we discuss in section 5.

while it is easy to prove that the full set of operators appearing in the commutator

in (4.1) is of the form given there, we have not proved that the above form of operators is

the full set of terms that can appear in the commutator in (4.3). we have some evidence

19

that the form of the algebra, restricting attention to pure twists is of the above form.

for example we know that the rhs cannot contain a descendant of a chiral primary,

which would not satisfy l0 = j0 as the lhs does. the l0 and j0 conservations alone
do allow other forms of operators which can be ruled out by using sn selection rules. in
particular, it appears that we do not need to include operators of the form (oo)o. the
generalization of the above ansatz to include the chiral factors which come up in the ap,q
n

is easily done at the cost of some extra notation.

we will be interested in a class of free eld realizations of the algebra obtained by

considering the full non-chiral operators. we note nevertheless that similar free oscillator

realizations can be considered for the chiral half of the algebra and that has some similari-

ties with the large n counting relevant for the full operators. we can realize the algebra in
terms of free oscillators, with [n, m] = n,m. in the large n expansion, for example,
by

am = m +

1
n

(1 + o(

1
n

)) x

m1,m2

m1m2 (m1 + m2  1, m)

1
n

)) x

m1,m2mk

m1 m2    mk (m1 + m2 +    mk  k + 1, m)
(4.5)

the coecients are matched with the algebra by using a recursive procedure.

now we move on to the combination of the left and right operators which give the

full chiral primaries. using the commutators of the chiral sectors of the form above, we

can write down the commutators of the non-chiral operators which contain terms written

below

x

(cid:2)om1 om1 , om1 om2(cid:3) =

(4.6)

which have a similar structure to the terms in (4.3).

a free eld representation for the algebra can be constructed where

an = n +

(1 + o(

))( +   ) +

n l/2 (1 + o(1/n ))l+1

(4.7)

the second term in the above expression is quadratic in the s. the higher term
2 is a polynomial in the ,  of degree l + 1. it is noteworthy that, for

weighted by n l

20

xed degree of the polynomial, the expansion involves powers of 1/n and not
. the
odd powers of n can be removed by redening the operators. this is in agreement
with the idea that the algebra is closely related to the exclusion principle and to quantum
groups, which both involve the parameter n , and not n .

1n

there are extra operators appearing on the rhs of the equation have the form

on om( onm) = nm +   

(4.8)

the composite operators have also been normalized to have unit two-point function. they

are subleading in the 1/n expansion.

4.1. hamiltonian

the free eld realizations of the algebra in the large n limit provide representations

of operators of the theory and of the hamiltonian. based on studying the free eld reps

of sub-algebras of the full algebra (in particular the global case of the previous section) we

expect that there exists rst a free representation where the hamiltonian is quadratic :

h (f ) = x

(m +

m,p,q

p + q

2

)p,q

mp,q

m

(4.9)

in this picture the interactions are contained in the nonlinear forms of the other (in par-

ticular the creation-anihilation ) generators. we expect another representation where the

hamiltonian is nonlinear and exibits interactions in 1/n .for the chiral primaries repre-

sented by (0, 0), (1, 1) and (2, 2) forms this takes the form

h i = x

x

(4.10)

with the form factor

v(k, n) = p(n + k)nk

(4.11)

21

and with appropriate numerical coecients . the above form would represent the lead-

ing term with higher interactions in powers of n . concerning this hamiltonian and the

emerging 1 + 1 dimensional eld theory one has the following comments.

it eectively

summarizes the dynamics of chiral primaries with their correlation functions. the dimen-

sion conjugate to the twist n corresponds to a coordinate of ads obtained after chiral

primary reduction. the structure of the 1+1 dimensional hamiltonian and its form factor

v(k, n) is identical in form to the collective eld theory [26] of 2d strings. the fact that

there is an analogy between the 2d noncritical string and radial dynamics in the ads/cft

correspondence has been observed earlier,for example [2,27]. we would also like to stress

that the dynamics outlined above is universal. chiral primaries in other ads theories
(ads5  s5 or ads4  s7 ) are also described by an analogous one plus one dimensional
hamiltonian. this follows by the fact that the form factor v(k, n) seems to be the same in

all these theories. in the present description it reects the fact that behind the ads/cft

correspondence there is an underlying non-critical string theory describable by coll. eld

theory.

the above structure (of the algebra) and the hamiltonian is operational on the space of

chiral primary operators. we should mention the extension to a more general class of states

as follows: using the susy algebra would provide couplings to other elds of the full short
multiplet, likewise the lowering operations of both sl(2)  sl(2) and su (2)  su (2)
would specify couplings to the corresponding descendants spanning the full ads3  s3
space-time. at leading orther this extensions are direct, at higher order in n they remain

a challenge. the non-linear realizations of some of the basic symmetries [28] might play

an important role in these extensions.

5. exclusion principle and the lie algebra of observables.

the properties of the lie algebra associated with the chiral primaries are closely

related to the exclusion principle. to clarify this we will need to review a few facts about
the chiral ring of the sn (x) theory, all of them related to the niteness properties, which

are referred to as the exclusion principle.

the simplest fact under this heading is that there an arbitrary element of the ring

generated by the a operators of section 2 has its left and right su (2) quantum num-
bers bounded as 2jl  2n and 2jr  2n . this follows from the unitarity constraints

22

of the n = 2 superconformal sub-algebras of the n = (4, 4) symmetry [29]. for exam-
ple (a(0,0)
2 )2n+1 necessarily vanishes by this argument. another aspect of the exclusion
principle, emphasized in i, refers to the properties of single particle states, which can be

dened in the cft as a linearly independent set of chiral primary operators which cannot

be written entirely in terms of products of other chiral primaries. they are the analogs

of single trace operators in yang mills. it was found in i that these generators are also

cuto by their sul(2) and sur(2) quantum numbers, and this was an important piece of

evidence in favour of a non-commutative spacetime. another property of the vector space

of chiral primaries is that it has a basis dened in terms of fock space creation operators
bp,q
n , which are related but not identical to the ap,q
n . we can describe a vector space
hb as a truncated fock space. its states are in 1-1 correspondence with

b1
n1 b2

n2    b

nk
nk|0 >

(5.1)

with the restriction pni
as generated by a

ni = n . the relation between the space of chiral primaries dened
n subject to relations between them which follow from the opes is as

follows. let these relations take the form

ri(a) = 0

(5.2)

consider the ring of polynomials in the a

n quotiented by the relations above, and let
this space be h/r where r is the ideal generated by the ri. we have an isomorphism

between h/r and hb.

the relations ri are closely related to the structure of the lie algebra we constructed

from the a and a. setting these elements to zero has to be consistent with the algebra.

in other words

[la, ri] = caijblbrj

(5.3)

where la and lb are elements in the universal enveloping algebra of the lie algebra. an

example of this kind of relation in the case of a simple sl(2) subalgebra as given in i. in

fact the unitarity conditions in the algebra were used to derive these relations.

23

5.1. q-deformed super-algebra structure of fusion rules

for simplicity we restrict the discussion here to couplings involving only the pure-twist
n . for n  n these are generating elements of the chiral ring. for small

operators a(0,0)

values of n we have fusion of the form

a(0,0)
n a(0,0)

m  a(0,0)

nm+1

(5.4)

there can also appear on the rhs products of as but we can restrict attention to the

terms on the rhs which are relevant for studying the 3-point functions of generators of
the chiral ring. on the left we have operators of su (2)l spins 2j1 = n1 and 2j2 = m1.
on the right we have 2j = 2j1 + 2j2. this is consistent with su (2) fusion rules but not

all su (2) reps. allowed by su (2) tensor products appear on the rhs. rather a good
model for the fusion is given by the tensor products of short reps. of sul(2|1, 1) ( since
the sur(2|1, 1) quantum numbers are identical to the left moving ones it suces to focus
on the left moving symmetry). the spin j then labels the largest su (2) spin present in
the decomposition of the short su (2|1, 1) rep. into reps. of its su (2) subalgebra.

a qualitatively new feature appears when n comes close to n , and n + k  n . then

a(0,0)
n a(0,0)

k  0

(5.5)

we can see this explicitly from the formulae for correlation functions we wrote down in

(2.34). we rewrite the equation relevant for this feature here :

ho(0,0)

n+k1()o(0,0)

k

(1) o(0,0)

n

(0)i = (

(n  n)! (n  k)! (n + k  1)3

(n  (n + k  1))! n ! n k

1
2

)

(5.6)

we see that when n + k  1 exceeds n the denominator contains a  function with a
negative integer argument which causes the expression to vanish. this feature can be
explained using fusion rules of suq(2|1, 1) where q is, as in i, given by q = e
q-deformed superalgebra will have a family of unitary short ( atypical ) reps. which will

n +1 . the

i

include unitary irreps. of the suq(2). since all the reps. of the suq(2) appearing in the
decomposition from suq(2|1, 1) to suq(2) have to be unitary, there will be a bound on
these short reps. 2j  n  1.

24

5.2. suq(2|1, 1) and multiparticle states

we have explained the qualitative features of the couplings between this family of
generators of the chiral ring, using suq(2|1, 1). it will be very interesting to nd a more de-
tailed comparison between the fusions of the chiral ring and the q-deformed super-algebra.

some novel features, unfamiliar from ordinary rational cft, but that have appeared in

studies of wzw on supergroups [30] have to be taken into account. for example it has

been found that one needs, in general, to take into account the indecomposable reps. of

the superalgebra as well. it is very plausible, that in this case, we also need to include
reps. of suq(2|1, 1) which contain indecomposables of the suq(2) sub-algebra. while the
suq(2|1, 1) with the q given above, nicely describes the cutos on generating a(p,q)
[4],
n

it also seems to have enough structure to account for some other cutos in this theory.
for example, suq(2) has, in addition to the standard irreps, with a cuto 2j  n  1, a
family of irreps i p
z in the notation of [31]. the detailed form of these reps. is given in [32].
usually one drops these reps. in studying standard connections between suq(2) and the

and su (2) wzw, but in this model the chiral primaries transform in more complicated

reps. of the su (2) current algebra than the standard integrable reps.

[33][34] usually

considered in su (2) wzw of level k = n . we may expect a larger class of suq(2) reps.

to appear in the corresponding quantum group model.

we mention a very suggestive numerical observation in favour of the above line of
argument. the family i p
0 has a cuto at 2j  2n . the an operators coming from
twisted sectors can be raised to powers which allow them to exceed the bound at n  1.
it turns out, however that that there is a cuto on the highest weight 2j  2n which
works for any chiral primary, as explained in the previous section. this means that if we

associate reps containing these indecomposables to some of the chiral primaries which are
products of ap,q
ns, we can explain both the cuto 2j  n  1 for the generators, and the
cuto 2j  2n for arbitrary chiral primaries.

5.3. black holes and correlation functions of chiral primaries

we saw that the exclusion principe is one manifestation of the breakdown of the

free-eld representation of the algebra we have been considering. this algebra, as we have

emphasized, is closely related to the correlation functions. we saw at the beginning of

this section in the discussion of (5.5) and (5.6) that the exclusion principle shows up in a

qualitative change in behaviour of the correlation functions as a function of a parameter

25

appraoching n . we also saw in the discussion of the untwisted sector algebra ( see in

particular (3.15)) that correlators with a large number of insertions start to show non-free

eld behaviour.

we would like to use the properties of the orbifold cft to nd the lowest conformal

weight where we may expect a divergence from free eld behaviour. recall the discussion

of the map to free elds. we had for example

however we do not have

a(0,0)
2 = 2 +   
a(0,0)
3 = 3 +   

(a(0,0)

2 )2 = 2

(5.7)

. rather the object which behaves more like 2

this would contradict the fact that the correlation function ha3a2a3i is non-zero at
order
2 is the twist operator associated
with the conjugacy class with two cycles of length 2, which is one of the terms in (4.6)
for example. while al
2 is not, for small l, a free oscillator raised to the lth power, its
behaviour in correlation functions should not be qualitatively dierent from a power of

a free eld because it is a linear combination including an operator which behaves like
l
2. when l hits n/2 the corresponding operator ceases to exist because we cannot have
a permutation with more than n
2 cycles of length 2. we observe that this happens at
l0 = n
3 where we may
expect a qualitative change in behaviour. if we consider a general operator of the form

3 we get a threshold of l = n

4 . if we try the same thing with al

(a2)n2 (a3)n3    ak

(5.9)

the corresponding free operator ceases to exist when 2n2 + 3n3 +    knk = n . it has

it is now clear that the lowest threshold we get is n
n
with p, q 6= 0 only increases the threshold. precisely this value l0 = n/4 was obtained
by [7][35] as the threshold where black holes start to be relevant. we have argued that
the same threshold appears if we ask for the lowest value of l0 where operators in the
chiral ring start to display behaviour qualitatively dierent from free elds.
it will be

very interesting to characterize the corresponding change of behaviour in the correlation

functions and compare with expectations from black hole physics.

6. conclusions

we have studied in this paper a lie algebra associated with the chiral primaries of
sn (t 4) cft and their cft conjugates. the structure constants of this lie algebra are

simply related to the correlation functions after an appropriate choice of basis. we obtained

by cft computations some of these structure constants, those which are determined by

the 3-point functions of bosonic chiral primaries. this leads to a dynamics described by

an eective 1+1 dimensional eld theory which corresponds to the simplest representation

of the algebra.

connections between the lie algebra and the stringy exclusion principle were studied

in i, where the relation with q-algebras and non-commutative spacetimes was emphasized.

these aspects were elaborated 5.1-5.3.

in 5.4 we focused on a characterization of the

exclusion principle as a deviation of the chiral primaries from free eld behaviour in corre-

lation functions, and we were lead to look for the lowest threshold where such deviation is
expected. we found that the lowest threshold is at l0 = n
4 which has been argued to be
relevant to black holes in ads3. developing further the relation between these correlation
functions and black holes will be very interesting.

the lie algebra is a much richer structure than the truncated fock space of the

chiral primaries themselves. the latter is only one representation of the lie algebra. this

simplest representation was studied in connection with actions associated to the correlation

functions of chiral primaries. this was done in detail in section 3 for the untwisted sector. a

coherent state basis was useful there, and we explained how the parameters in the coherent

states are related to the multi-oscillator heisenberg algebra at large n . in section 4, we

pursued the study of the large n map between the lie algebra and the multi-oscillator

heisenberg algebra ( free elds ).

our discussion naturally raises the question of other representations of the algebra

which are not directly related to the fock space of the chiral primaries. these will be

important in studying the stringy states, which are certainly important since the free orb-

ifold cft is expected to be dual to a gravitational background where the graviton as well

as other stringy degrees of freedom are important, as emphasized in [10,11,12]. studying

the stringy states as representations of this algebra derived from chiral primaries and their

conjugates is particularly interesting, since the chiral primaries and their truncations show

clear evidence of a non-commutative spacetime. this point of view on the stringy states

should clarify the relevance of the non-commutative space-time to the dynamics of the full

set of stringy degrees of freedom.

27

the precise role of the non-commutative spacetime in determining the dynamics of

this gravitational theory remains to be further studied, but the simplest possibility is that,

in analogy to the case of non-commutative yang mills [36] there is simple action on a

non-commutative spacetime which is related to a complicated action on a commutative

spacetime. the fact that the techniques of collective eld theory allow the construction of

spacetime actions starting from the cft should allow one to explore the above possibility.

other approaches for studying the non-commutativity of spacetime coordinates in the

context of string theory on ads-type backgrounds have been suggested in [37][38].

7. appendix

let us consider rst the ope we used which can be read from [15]where it is detemined

by a geometric construction. we will also neglect the fact that in our case the theory is a
t 4 orbifold, whereas in [15], it was a noncompact orbifold. the result for the constant is

taken from equation (5.24) in [15]with the following redenitions:

n = n + 1, n0 = n, d = 6, p1 = kn, p2 = 0, p = k2;

c(2, n|n + 1; k2, kn) = 2a nb (n + 1)c,

we outline here the derivation for the equations used in the text only for the twist eld
which does not involve any t 4 indices, o(1..n)(u, u). in this case, in the equations (7.2)we
2 , c = 1
take k2 = (0, 0, 0, 0, 1

2 ), kn = (0, 0, 0, 0, n1

2 ) which give a = 1, b =  1

2 , n1

2 , 1

and we have the rst equation in (2.24). combining this result with an identical one for

the right movers we obtain:

o(n n+1)(u, u) o(1..n)(0) =

1
4

n + 1

n

(o(1..n+1)(0) + o(1..n+1 n)(0))

(7.4)

this result has a clear interpretation for the case when the lenght of the cycle at 0 is set to

1, namely n = 1 case. we used this extrapolation for the other cases to arrive at equations

(2.25).

starting from equation (7.4) we can use now the conformal eld theory rules in order

to determine more involved correlators. we look to an ope involving three twists:

o(n+k1 n+k)(u, u) o(n..n+k1)(z, z) o(1..n)(0) = const. (o(1..n+k)(0) + ...)

(7.5)

where ... stand for the other 4 possible terms, and the right hand side is in the limit
u  0; z  0. for consistency, the limit should not depend on the order, and from this
we derive the following recurrence equation for the constant which appear in the ope of

a twist of lenght n and of one of lenght k, denoted in this appendix as c(n,k):

c(n, k + 1) = c(n, k)

c(n, 2) =

(n + 1)

4 n

.

(n + k) k

(n + k  1) (k + 1)

,

these equations are solved by :

c(n, k) =

n + k  1

2 n k

(7.6)

(7.7)

it is interesting to observe that in this derivation of the constants appearing in the ope

of the twist operators it was helpful to use both the geometric construction [15]and the

associativity of the ope in conformal eld theory.

using a similar derivation, we are able to obtain also the ope for the twist operators

overlapping over a two cycle.
