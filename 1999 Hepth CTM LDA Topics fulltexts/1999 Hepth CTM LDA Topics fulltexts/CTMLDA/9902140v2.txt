we study the geometry of interacting knotted solitons. the interaction is local and ad-
vances either as a three-body or as a four-body process, depending on the relative orienta-
tion and a degeneracy of the solitons involved. the splitting and adjoining is governed by a
four-point vertex in combination with duality transformations. the total linking number is
preserved during the interaction. it receives contributions both from the twist and the writhe,
which are variable. therefore solitons can twine and coil and links can be formed.

knotlike congurations appear in a variety of physical, chemical and biological sce-
narios. examples include early universe cosmology, the structure of elementary parti-
cles, magnetic materials, turbulent uid dynamics, polymer folding, and dna replica-
tion, transcription and recombination. whenever knots occur, it becomes important to
understand how they twist, coil, split and adjoin.

here we outline a geometrical rst principles approach for understanding knots in
interaction. for deniteness we shall consider hamiltonian eld theories where knots
appear as solitons i.e. as stable nite energy solutions to the pertinent nonlinear equa-
tions of motion [1]-[4]. even though our conclusions are independent of any detailed
stucture of the equations of motion, for concreteness we specify to a three component
vector eld ~n(~x) with unit length ~n  ~n = 1 [5]. we note that ~n appears as an order
parameter in a variety of applications. it can for example describe magnetization in a
ferromagnet, velocity distribution ~n = ~v/|~v| in uids, the director eld in a nematic
liquid crystal, and quantum uctuations of a higgs eld around a spontaneously broken
vacuum in a grand unied eld theory.

a soliton conguration is localized, and ~n goes to a constant vector ~n(~x)  ~n0 at
spatial innity. therefore it is a map from the compactied three-space r3  s 3 to the
internal unit two-sphere s 2
~n. such maps fall into nontrivial homotopy classes 3(s 2)  z
labelled by the hopf invariant [6] which can be evaluated by noting that the pre-image
in r3 of a point in s 2
~n is an embedding of a circle s 1  r3. this embedding is a knot
in the mathematical sense [6], and the hopf invariant is the linking number of any two
such knots. we select the asymptotic vector ~n0 to point down, along the negative z-axis
in three-space. at the core (center) of the knotted soliton ~n then points up, and the
pre-image of the core is a mathematical knot ~x() parametrized by   [0, 2] so that
~x( + 2) = ~x().

we consider a short strand of a knotted soliton, a tubular distribution of energy
density that surrounds the core and does not overlap with any other strand. we inspect
it with a planar cross sectional disk d  r3 that cuts the strand at right angle to its
core at ~x(). the center of d coincides with the core, and its boundary is a circle
around the core where ~n  ~n0 = ez, see gure 1. note that topologically each d is
a (riemann) two-sphere s 2
~n that can
be locally parametrized by

notice that a knotted soliton has either a right-handed or a left-handed orientation
which is determined by d  d  d . furthermore, for any regular hamiltonian the
hopf invariant is conserved even when we have interactions where strands split and
adjoin.

we combine n1 and n2 in (1) into a two component vector eld ~w = (n1, n2). the
core  = 0 is a xed point of ~w. therefore we can dene an index ind(~w) that counts
how many times ~w rotates around the core when we go once around it along some curve
on the disk d in the right-handed direction. this index is a topological invariant which
is independent both of the curve on d and of the point  along the core, and from (1)
we nd ind(~w) = l. this index is also additive, if we evaluate it along a curve that
surrounds n xed points of ~w the result coincides with the sum of the n indices for the
individual xed points.

the third component n3 in (1) is a continuous function on d with values between
[1, +1]. it has a maximum at the core  = 0 and its minimum occurs on the boundary of
the disk d where   . in general the maximum at  = 0 is a degenerate critical point,
and for our knotted solitons we expect that its degeneracy has a denite multiplicity
given by the absolute value of the index ind(~w),

deg(n3)|=0 = |ind(~w)|  |l|

(3)

in particular, when ind(~w) = 1 the core is non-degenerate. in the model studied in
[1]-[4] we can verify (3) explicitly: if  measures distance from the core in local polar
coordinates (, ) on d , we nd from the equations of motion that the core is truly a
degenerate critical point of n3 on d with l-fold multiplicity,

n3(, ) 0

= 1  o(2|l|)

(4)

this result is related to analyticity near  = 0: the disks d have a natural complex
structure sin d  d  dz  dz suggesting that (3) should be valid whenever the
equations of motion are elliptic. indeed, in our physical applications (3) makes sense. it
means that a knotted soliton with l-fold degeneracy is a bound state of l non-degenerate
ones.

since  = 0 is a critical point of n3, we have

n3

( = 0) = 0

and since the core is a curve in r3, the 3  3 symmetric matrix

has one vanishing eigenvalue 1 = 0, the corresponding eigenvector is tangent to the
core. since  = 0 is a maximum, the two additional eigenvalues of (6) are non-positive
2,3( )  0 at the core. if both are non-vanishing the core is a non-degenerate critical
point of n3 on d . but if the core is a degenerate critical point then either 2 or 3 (or
both) should vanish.

we now proceed to apply these considerations to geometrically describe the inter-
actions between strands of knotted solitons. we rst inspect the situation with two
initial strands that both have a non-degenerate core. we then explain how the results
generalize when strands have degenerate cores.

when both initial strands have a non-degenerate core, the corresponding eigenval-
ues 2,3( ) are non-vanishing. therefore a nontrivial interaction such as splitting and
adjoining can not occur unless at least one of the 2,3( ) vanishes. at that point the
two cores must coincide.

we rst assume that the two initial strands have a parallel relative orientation. from
(3) we then conclude that when the cores coincide  = 0 becomes a doubly degenerate
critical point of n3 with ind(~w) = 2, depending on whether the two strands are right-
handed or left-handed. the interaction is pointwise with two outgoing non-degenerate
strands, and it can be described by a four-point vertex.

to visualize the vertex we draw plane projections of the strands. for this we trace
the three gradient vectors d, d and d along the cores. the gradient d is (co)tangent
to a core. in a plane projection we describe it by drawing an arrow along the direction
of the core. for each  the two additional gradients d and d span the cross sectional
planes d . we describe them by drawing two oriented lines in the vicinity of the core.
we recall that the self-linking number lk of a knotted soliton can be computed from

its plane projection using [6]

lk = t w + w r

(7)

where t w is the twist and w r is the writhe in the plane projection. during an interaction
neither t w nor w r is in general separately conserved. only their sum is since it coincides
with the hopf invariant which is conserved.

to picture the interaction vertex, we rst employ continuity to translate all twists
and writhes in the initial strands away from the vicinity of the interaction point. the
plane projections of the initial congurations then become well-groomed lines with either
antiparallel (a) or parallel (p) alignment. for example, in the case of two (right-handed)
planar strands with antiparallel (a) alignment, we have the four-point interaction vertex
va in gure 2. here both the twist and the writhe are separately conserved. in the case
of two (right-handed) planar strands with parallel (p) alignment we have the four-point

3

interaction vertex vp in gure 3. here neither the twist nor the writhe are conserved but
their sum is, since the interaction preserves the hopf invariant. note that a dierence in
the nal twist and writhe between the two vertices has important physical consequences,
it suggests that the strands will twine, coil and link. indeed, by repeating vp twice as
in gure 4, we either continue coiling or form a link, depending on the global geometry.
this is not equally obvious in the case va. however, we note that in r3 a writhe can
always be continuously deformed into a twist. furthermore, two non-coplanar strands
can exhibit an antiparallel alignment in one plane projection, but parallel alignment
in another plane projection. consequently we expect that the two vertices vp and va
should be related. for this we rst vertically ip the plane projection of one of the
two initial strands in gure 3. this yields two strands with antiparallel alignment in
the plane projection. we then implement an interaction described by the vertex va in
gure 2, followed by another vertical ip. the result coincides with that obtained by
implementing the vertex vp alone. this means that the two vertices va and vp are dual
to each other, with vertical ip dening the duality transformation.

depending on the dynamical details of the hamiltonian, besides splitting and ad-
joining the two initial strands may also combine into a single strand but with a doubly
degenerate core. this can be described using the topologically invariant index ind(~w).
as an example we consider two initial right-handed strands both with ind(~w) = +1
(gure 5). since the index is additive, we conclude that for a curve which encircles both
cores we have ind(~w) = +2. this is also the index of the nal, doubly degenerate
strand. the interaction is a process where two homotopically nontrivial maps s 1
  s 1
each with a 1(s 1) winding number +1 combine into a single map with 1(s 1) winding
number +2. dynamically, this leads to the formation of a doubly degenerate knotted
soliton, a bound state, in a manner which is consistent with the conservation of the hopf
invariant. we visualize the interaction as a three-body process in gure 5.

when the two initial strands have an opposite orientation, splitting and adjoining can
not occur since two strands with dierent orientation should not connect. instead the
two strands can annihilate each other. as in gure 5, this can also be described using
the topologically invariant index ind(~w). for example, if one of the initial strands
corresponds to ind(~w) = +1 and the other strand to ind(~w) = 1, since the index
is additive we conclude that for a curve that encircles both cores we have ind(~w) = 0.
as in gure 5, the interaction is a process where two homotopically nontrivial maps
s 1
  s 1 combine. but now one of the initial maps has 1(s 1) winding number +1
and the other 1, and the combined map is homotopically trivial. this corresponds
to an annihilation between the two strands, that proceeds dynamically in a manner
which is consistent with the conservation of the hopf invariant. the annihilation can be
visualized as a three-body process, much like in gure 5.

in the general case where the initial strands are degenerate the interaction can pro-
ceed in a multitude of dierent fashions, details depending on the degrees of degeneracy

and the relative orientations of the interacting strands. but according to (3) degenerate
strands can always be viewed as bound states of non-degenerate strands. thus there is
no need to discuss their interactions separately. we can always describe their interac-
tions using various combinations of the interactions that occur between non-degenerate
strands, in a rather obvious manner.

finally, the interaction processes that we have outlined here all conserve the hopf
invariant. this follows from the condition that the order parameter ~n is a unit vector.
but in a number of applications one may wish to relax the constraint ~n  ~n = 1 so that
|~n| can vanish at some points in r3. one way to achieve this is to replace the constraint
by a term (~n~n 1)2 in the hamiltonian, with  a coupling constant. when    we
recover ~n  ~n = 1. but for nite (large) coupling we expect |~n| to uctuate in the vicinity
of |~n|  1 even though we can also have |~n(~x)|  0 at some points. this generalizes the
models discussed here in a manner that should be of interest in a variety of applications.
for example in quantum eld theory it allows us to recover renormalizability, while in
molecular biology it enables us to account for eects of entzymes in dna. obviously
study of interaction processes with a nite  should be of wide interest.

we have found that depending on the relative orientation and degeneracy of the
solitons involved, an actual interaction can involve various combinations of splitting and
adjoining, twisting, coiling and linking. it can lead to the formation of bound states and
annihilation between strands. our description of the interaction processes is quite model
independent and based entirely on elementary conceps of continuity and dierentiability.
consequently we hope that our results can form a basis for detailed investigations of
interacting knots. indeed, we expect that numerical studies in the model discussed in
[1]-[5] (and its generalization to the case where |~n| can vanish) provide prolic tests for
various aspects of knot interaction.
