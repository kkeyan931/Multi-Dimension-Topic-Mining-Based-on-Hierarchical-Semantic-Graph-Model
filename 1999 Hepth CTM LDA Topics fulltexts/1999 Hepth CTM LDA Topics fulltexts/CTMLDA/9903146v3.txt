abstract

we propose an uncertainty relation of space-time. this relation is characterized by
gt . v , where t and v denote a characteristic time scale and a spatial volume,

respectively. using this uncertainty relation, we give qualitative estimations for the
entropies of a black hole and our universe. we obtain qualitative agreements with

the known results. the holographic principle of t hooft and susskind is reproduced.
we also discuss cosmology and give a relation to the cosmic holographic principle of

fischler and susskind. however, as for the maximal entropy of a system with an energy

e, we obtain the formulapev /g2, with v denoting the volume of the system, which

is distinct from the bekenstein entropy formula er/ with r denoting the length scale

of the system.

introduction

1.

despite various noteworthy attempts, the cosmological constant problem remains as one
of the major mysteries in physics. 1) if we believe the locality of our world, the fundamental
degrees of freedom of a system should be the degrees of freedom at a suciently small

scale, because, understanding these, we can make a prediction at any scale larger than this
small scale. the natural small scale associated with gravity is the planck length. the

fundamental degrees of freedom of gravity are believed to be somehow associated with this
planck length. our general knowledge of quantum eld theory tells us that the vacuum

quantum uctuations of these degrees of freedom induce a cosmological constant on the
huge order (planck length)4, since a cosmological constant can exist in general relativity,
which is well established as the theory of gravity for macroscopic phenomena.

on the other hand, turning to the matter sector, qcd is well established as a quantum

eld theory of su(3) non-abelian gauge elds (and quark elds). qcd is an asymptotically
free eld theory, and non-abelian gauge elds are weakly interacting at a suciently small

scale. on such a small scale, the non-abelian gauge eld behaves like a classical eld, and we
may safely assume that the fundamental degrees of freedom of qcd are the (classical) non-

abelian gauge eld. however, in quantum gravity, we have a conict between the locality
and the weakness of the interactions. although the metric tensor eld describes macroscopic
phenomena quite well, the interaction becomes stronger on a smaller scale. if we impose the

locality of our world, the fundamental degrees of freedom of gravity should have quantum
mechanical properties as their basic properties. the quantum mechanical properties may be

incorporated by an uncertainty relation of space-time.

in this paper, we propose a space-time uncertainty relation and question whether the

fundamental scale associated with gravity is really the planck length. our proposal looks
quite unusual at rst sight, but it turns out to be consistent with known results. in 2, we
explain the motivation for our proposal. based on the space-time uncertainty relation, we
nd that the density of the degrees of freedom vanishes in an innitely stretching space-time.
this might be a nice property to solve the cosmological constant problem. in 3, we evaluate
the entropy in a spatial region as a function of the volume and the energy of the region and
compare it with the previously obtained results. in 4, we discuss thermodynamics. in 5,
we evaluate the entropy and the energy density originating from the space-time itself in our
universe. in 6, we summarize our results and give some discussion. in the appendix, we
give the derivation of the entropy formula used in 3. throughout this paper, we use a unit
system in which c = 1.

2. a space-time uncertainty relation

the fundamental degrees of freedom of general relativity are the metric tensor eld, which

is associated with each point in the (3+1)-dimensional space-time. it is implicitly assumed
that we can construct a coordinate system and measure the values of the metric tensor eld.
this process seems to have no diculties in classical mechanics. we could arrange clocks

in an appropriate way and measure the metric eld by interchanging light or some particles
among them. as one arranges more clocks in a spatial region, the measurement becomes

ner. one might worry about the inuence from the masses of the clocks themselves
when the density of the clocks becomes large. but it would not contradict the principles

of classical mechanics to make a clock with an arbitrarily small mass, though it would
become an unlimitedly dicult engineering problem.

however, in quantum mechanics, one notices a serious diculty in the above process. 13)
as the mass of each clock becomes smaller, the coordinate system decays in a shorter time.
to see this, let us consider the construction of a coordinate system for a time interval t and

with a spatial neness x in a minkowski space-time. since a clock must be localized in
a region with the scale x, the clock inevitably has a momentum of the order p  /x,
obtained from the uncertainty relation of quantum mechanics. thus the clocks move with
a nite velocity of order v  /mx, where m denotes the masses of the clocks. this
implies that the coordinate system will be destroyed by the quantum eect in a nite period
x/v  m(x)2/. this period must be larger than the time interval t of the coordinate.
hence we obtain

t . m(x)2/.

(2.1)

this gives a lower bound for the clock mass m for given t and x.

from (2.1), we need clocks with a larger mass to construct a ner coordinate system.
however we also have a maximum value of a clock mass, because no clock should become

a black hole. to measure the gravitational eld, it should be possible to interchange light or
particles among clocks. thus the schwarzschild radius should not exceed the uncertainty

x of each clock:

the clock mass can be chosen arbitrary if it satises (2.1) and (2.2). thus the condition
for the existence of such a clock mass is

gm . x.

(2.2)

gt . (x)3.

(2.3)

since we cannot construct an appropriate coordinate system unless the inequality (2.3)
is satised, it would be natural to propose that the inequality (2.3) is the property of a

3

space-time itself with t and x denoting the time scale and the spatial uncertainty of the
space-time, respectively. regarding (x)3 as the volume associated with each clock, (2.3)
would be rewritten in the form

gt . v,

(2.4)

where v denotes a volume uncertainty.

a aw in the above derivation is that we neglected the dynamical eect caused by the
gravitational eld generated by the clocks. one easily nds from (2.1) that a coordinate
system is destroyed in a much shorter time by the gravitational eects among the clocks

themselves than by the quantum eects. to justify neglecting this eect, we should consider
the case in which the distances among clocks are much larger than the neness x. in this
case, the neness x represents the uncertainty of the coordinate associated to each clock.
an unusual point of the inequality (2.3) is that the minimal spatial length x has a
positive correlation with the time interval t . although it seems as if the left-hand side of
(2.3) can be made arbitrarily small, we cannot detect an arbitrarily small spatial length scale.
to show this, let us suppose a test particle is injected into a system to detect a structure with
a length scale x of the system by a collision experiment. since the speed of the particle is

smaller than the speed of light, the collision experiment needs a time longer than x. thus,
from (2.3), we have

gx < gt . (x)3,

(2.5)

which dictates that the minimal length detectable is indeed the planck length g.

when we take the time scale t very large, the inequality (2.3) tells us quite an unusual
thing for a space-time. if the time scale t diverges, the neness x also diverges. this means
that a space-time with an innite characteristic time scale has a vanishing density of degrees

of freedom. we will use this property in the discussion of the cosmological constant problem
in 5.

from (2.4), it would be natural to propose that a fundamental degree of freedom of

quantum gravity is associated with a nite spatial volume determined by

v = cbtgt,

(2.6)

where cbt is a numerical constant. we discuss the value of this constant in 5, but for the
time being we simply leave it undetermined. we call each such fundamental space-time

region a space-time bit in this paper.

4

3. the number of bits in a region with a given energy

in this section, we discuss the maximal number of the space-time bits in a spatial region

with a total volume v and a total energy e, and give a formula for the entropy associated
with the region.

suppose a spatial region is composed of bits labeled by an integer i = 1,    , n. we

assume the total spatial volume v is partitioned by the bits

v =

vi.

n

xi=1

(3.1)

we now use the uncertainty inequality for energy, e  /t . we assume also that the total
energy is partitioned by the bits. then we have

e =

xi=1

(3.2)

in the last relation, we have used (2.6). under the constraint (3.1), the quantitypn

in
(3.2) takes its minimum value when the volume of each bit, vi, takes the same value v /n.
thus we obtain an inequality

g2
vi

i=1

or

there is no reason to believe that the maximum value of the number of the bits in a region
agrees with the entropy associated with it. however, in the appendix, we give discussion
that illustrates that the right-hand side of (3.4) is in fact approximately proportional to the
entropy:)

where c0 is a proportionality factor that is a constant in the leading approximation.

s(e, v )  c0r ev
g2 ,

(3.5)

the right-hand side of (3.4) becomes per3/g2 for a system with a characteristic
scale r. thus the equation (3.4) has an extra factor pr/eg, compared with the so-called

bekenstein entropy bound er/. 2), 3) in the case that the schwarzschild bound ge < r
is satised, the bound (3.4) is larger than the bekenstein entropy bound. thus (3.4) is
distinct from the bekenstein entropy bound but does not contradict it. in the case ge > r,
the entropy formula (3.5) gives a value smaller than the bekenstein bound. this plays an
important role in explaining the entropy of our universe in 5.

this is the basic inequality of the holographic principle of t hooft and susskind 4) that the
world can be described by the degrees of freedom on a two-dimensional surface. in the case
of a black hole, the schwarzschild bound is saturated. regarding r2 as the area of the black
hole, we obtain qualitative agreement with the bekenstein-hawking entropy formula. 5), 3)

4. thermodynamics

in this section we discuss thermodynamics based on the entropy formula (3.5).
using the rst law of the thermodynamics de = t ds  p dv , we nd

if we assume that the energy distribution is uniform, from (4.2) we obtain

(4.3)

where  denotes the energy density. if we regard r as v 1/3, we instead obtain p = e/3v =
/3 from the bekenstein entropy formula s  er. this is the same relation between the
energy density and the pressure as that of radiation, while we obtain a distinct relation
(4.3). the relation (4.3) describes the most incompressible uid that is consistent with
special relativity. in this uid, sound propagates at the velocity of light. this light speed
propagation might be understood as that of a graviton. equation (4.3) is distinct from the
relation p =  = , also, which we would have if the cosmological constant term were
interpreted as an energy-momentum tensor.

the pressure (4.3) should also play important roles in black hole physics and cosmology.

5. cosmological implications

in this section, we discuss the entropy of our universe and then discuss the cosmological

constant problem.

6

the total entropy of our universe would be accurately estimated by the entropy produced
at the planckian time tp = lp = g from the big bang. substituting t = tp into (2.6),
the volume vp of a bit at the planckian time is

thus the total number of the bits in the universe at the planckian time is estimated as

vp  gtp = (lp )3.

np 

r3
p

lp (cid:19)3
vp (cid:18)rp

(5.2)

where rp denotes the size of the observable part of our universe at the planckian time.
thus, using (3.5) and e  np /tp , we obtain the entropy of our universe as

su s np v

lp (cid:19)3
tpg  np (cid:18)rp

 1090.

(5.3)

here we have used rp  1030lp obtained from the friedman-robertson-walker (frw)
cosmological model with the epoch of matter-radiation density equality teq  1011 sec. the
value (5.3) is very near the entropy obtained from the 2.7 k cosmic microwave background.
this value (5.3) of the entropy of our universe has been recently discussed from the
point of view of the cosmic holographic principle, 6) - 8) fischler and susskind 6) have shown
that the cosmic holographic principle gives a bound on the expansion rate and that it can
be translated into a bound on the equation of state. the bound is saturated by the most
incompressible perfect uid, which we discussed in 4. we can obtain the same bound by
imposing the second law of thermodynamics, namely that the entropy of our universe should
not decrease with time. to show this, let us assume a(t)  tp, where a(t) is the scale factor
of the frw metric. then, v (t)  t from (2.6) and v (t)  t3p. thus, by a similar argument
as that used in deriving (5.3), we nd the behavior of entropy to be described by

s(t)  n(t)  t3p1.
thus, for the second law to be satised, we must have

1
3

,

p 

(5.4)

(5.5)

which can be translated into the bound   1 for the equation of state p = . relations
between the generalized second law and the cosmic holographic principle are discussed in

ref. 8).

as discussed in 2, the notion of a space-time bit seems to seriously contradict the classical
notion of the (3+1)-dimensional space-time, if the range of time is innite. this suggests

7

that the space-time volume operator r d4xg does not exist in quantum gravity.

since the cosmological constant is the coupling constant associated with this operator,

the suggestion indicates that we cannot introduce the cosmological constant into quantum
gravity. however, our universe does not have an innite range of time, so we expect there

to be a term analogous to the cosmological constant. we can estimate this as follows. we
choose the age of the universe tu as the characteristic time scale. then, from (2.6), the
volume of a space-time bit of our universe is

vu  cbtgtu .

(5.6)

each bit will have an energy /tu , from the uncertainty relation. thus the energy density
of our universe originating from the space-time itself is obtained as

st 



tu vu 

1

cbtgt 2
u

.

(5.7)

this is on the same order as the critical density c = 3h 2/8g, where h is the hubble
constant, and so might be large enough to change signicantly the evolution scenario of our

universe.

we now give an argument to estimate the numerical constant cbt in (2.6). let us consider
an frw cosmological model with a vanishing spatial curvature, and, as a matter, consider
a perfect uid with the thermodynamic property given in 4. the conservation law of the
stress-energy tensor,  + 3( + p ) a/a = 0, determines the density as

 =

c
a6 ,

(5.8)

where c is a numerical constant. substituting (5.8) into the evolution equation 3 a2/a2 =
8g, we obtain a3 = 24gct, and hence

 =

1

24gt2 .

(5.9)

since general relativity gives a perfect description, at least for a macroscopic object, it
would be natural to demand that the result (5.9) agree with (5.7) for tu = t. moreover,
since a(t)  t1/3, this evolution is an adiabatic process, as can be seen from (5.4), and is
consistent with the conservation of the stress-energy tensor used in the derivation of (5.8).
thus we obtain

cbt  24.

(5.10)

an important comment is that the perfect uid with the thermodynamic properties in

section 4 does not fully represent the properties of space-time bits. as an example in the

8

frw model of a at spatial curvature, let us consider the case in which there exists dust.
since the energy density of dust behaves as 1/a3 and decreases more slowly than (5.8), the
evolution of the universe is dominated by dust after a suciently long time. then the scale
factor behaves as a  t2/3 in this regime, and, substituting this into (5.8), we obtain   1/t4.
this contradicts (5.7), which was derived simply from the uncertainty relation of energy and
time. we propose that the thermodynamic properties change somehow in the regime and
(5.7) is the correct answer. substituting (5.10) into (5.7), the ratio of the energy density
originating from the space-time itself to the critical density becomes

st =

st
c 

1

9(htu )2 .

(5.11)

comparing this with the observational data, since htu  1, we see that a good portion of
the total energy density of our universe originates from the space-time itself.

since the time scale of our universe is very large, it would be interesting to estimate the

length scale of a space-time bit. we obtain

(cbtgtu )1/3  1014 m  (10 mev)1,

(5.12)

where we have taken tu = 1010 year. although this energy scale is much lower than the
planck energy and is within the range of high energy experiments, it is not clear whether

or how this length scale can be observed in a high energy experiment or an astrophysical
observation.

6. summary and discussion

in this paper, we have proposed an uncertainty relation for space-time and have estimated

some quantities in quantum gravity. an interesting point is that, although the proposed
uncertainty relation is very dierent from the usually expected relations such as tx & l2
p
or x & lp , we have obtained results qualitatively consistent with the known results, and
have not found any serious deviations from them. the purpose of this paper is merely to

show the surprise of the consistencies, but not to give a concrete way to calculate quantities
in quantum gravity.

of course we hope that the uncertainty relation we have proposed turns out to be an
intermediate notion which catches an essential property of quantum gravity. the most pecu-
liar point is that our space-time uncertainty relation is not consistent with the cosmological

constant term. presently the most promising approach to quantum gravity is string theory.
the microscopic derivation of the entropy formula for a bps black hole from d-brane dynam-
ics is impressive. 9) the uncertainty relations in string theory are of the form tx & l2
s and

9

x & lmin, 10) which work evidently as an ultraviolet cuto. the reduction of the degrees of
freedom in the infrared limit is realized through a duality which interchanges small scale and
large scale dynamics. 11), 10) thus there is the possibility for an uncertainty relation similar
to ours to be derived from string theory. we hope this as well as our space-time uncertainty

relation will be helpful in constructing a new theory describing quantum gravity.

finally, in lattice approaches to quantum gravity, an uncertainty relation of the kind
x, t & lmin seems to be assumed implicitly. 12) our uncertainty relation may provide a new
direction for such approaches.

appendix

in this appendix, we evaluate a quantity which is similar to entropy in statistical mechan-
ics to illustrate that the right-hand side of (3.4) can be regarded as a quantity proportional
to the entropy of space-time. what we consider here is just an example. it is not a proof,
because we do not have any reliable microscopic theory of quantum gravity.

let us consider a space-time with a total number of bits n, a total volume v and a total
energy e. the quantity we evaluate is the phase volume of energies and volumes with the

for given e and v , the maximum value of (a.7) with respect to n will give its total

introduced by neglecting h(z) is just z0 ln(h(z0))  0.1, and hence is of next higher order.
