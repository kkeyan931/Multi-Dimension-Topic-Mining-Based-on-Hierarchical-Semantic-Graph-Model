within the framework of the gaussian wave-functional approach, we investigate the inuences
of quantum and nite-temperature eects on the z2-symmetry(  ) of the (1+1)-dimensional
massive sine-gordon eld theory.
it is explicitly demonstrated that by quantum eects the z2-
symmetry can be restored in one region of the parameter space and dynamically spontaneously
broken in another region. moreover, a nite-temperature eect can further restore the z2-symmetry
only.

i. introduction

the massive sine-gordon eld theory (msgft) [1] is an interesting and important one in quantum eld theory,
particle physics and condensed matter physics. it is a simple generalization of the massless sine-gordon eld theory
(sgft) [2] which received an extensive investigations [35], with a vacuum angle  added in the argument of the
cosine and a mass term m2
02 added in the lagrangian. nevertheless, dierent from the sgft, the lagrangian of
msgft is no longer invariant under the transformation of the eld   ( + 2n
 ), and at the classical level, the
symmetry    (z2-symmetry) can be spontaneously broken, which is an important phenomenon for quantum
eld theory and particle physics [6]. furthermore, the 1 + 1-dimensional (2d) msgft is equivalent to many other
important models, such as the massive schwinger model at a special coupling strength and on the zero-charge sector
[7], the massive schwinger-thirring model on the zero-charge sector [8,9], the two-dimensional (2d) lattice abelian
higgs model [10], the 2d neutral yukawa gas [11], and so on. also, the 2d msgft is useful in the investigations
of uid membranes [12] and vortices in 2d superconductors [13]. therefore, it is of general importance to explore
various properties of the msgft.

in fact, many investigations of the 2d msgft have existed. early in 1970s, the 2d msgft was analyzed within
the framework of constructive quantum eld theory. the existence of the 2d msgft was proved for a certain region
of the parameter space [1,8,14], and frohlich et al also showed the nontriviality of the scattering, the existence of
the one boson states (fermion-anti-fermion bound state), the zero-charge of the physical states in the 2d msgft,
and so on [8,9]. recently, in order to reveal the phase structure of the 2d abelian higgs model [10] and discuss the
intrinsic nite size eect in 2d superconductors [13], the 2d msgft with a nite momentum cuto was treated by
renormalization-group technique. additionally, as an equivalent system of the massive schwinger model, the msgft
was investigated for large m2
0 by fermi-mass perturbation [7](1975) [1517], on the light front [18] or at nite densities
and/or temperatures [19] to discuss the chiral condensate, quark connement, the -vacuum, particle spectra, etc..
using the gaussian wave-functional approach (gwfa) [20], we also had a quantitative investigation to the ground,
one- and two-particle states of the 2d msgft with zero vacuum angle [21].

nevertheless, we feel that for the 2d msgft there are still many problems worth investigating. for instance,
the spontaneous breakdown of z2-symmetry (z2ssb) is such an interesting phenomenon. as was stated in the rst
paragraph, z2-symmetry of the classical vacuum of the 2d msgft is spontaneously broken [15,16,21]. the z2ssb of
the classical vacuum means that the classical potential has a minimum, for example, at two points in the eld space
 =  1 (here, 1 is positive), or say, is two-fold degenerate (innitely degenerate for the sgft), and accordingly
the classical vacuum is occasionally located at one of the two points  =  1 and consequently z2-symmetry is
broken. similarly, at a quantum level, when eective potential for a quantum eld theory is, for example, two-fold
degenerate, the quantum vacuum is spontaneously located at a non-zero eld point, and accordingly z2-symmetry is
also spontaneously broken. in the 1970s, ref. [16] infered that for the 2d msgft the z2ssb at a classical level would

be usually maintained at a quantum level, and ref. [15] pointed out qualitatively, based on a semiclassical calculation,
that for the bosonic equivalent to the massive schwinger model z2-symmetry suers spontaneous breakdown in some
case. besides, ref. [1] pointed out that the z2-symmetry in the 2d msgft is presumably dynamically broken in some
case. recently, we also demonstrated explicitly the existence of the z2-ssb phenomenon within the framework of the
gwfa [21]. however, as compared to what occurs at the classical level, the inuence of quantum eects on the z2-ssb
phenomenon is not clear. usually, quantum eects can alter the z2-symmetry of the vacuum, and accordingly turn a
symmetric vacuum at the classical level into an asymmetric one at the quantum level, or vice verse, an asymmetric
vacuum at the classical level into a symmetric one at the quantum level. the latter is called the restoration of
z2-symmetry [22,3,6](1996), and the former is called the dynamical breakdown of z2-symmetry (z2dsb) in this
paper. by dynamical breakdown 1, we mean that it is just by quantum eects that the z2-symmetry enjoyed by the
classical vacuum is spontaneously broken at a quantum level. when z2dsb occurs, we also say the z2-symmetry is
dynamically spontaneously broken, which is really involved in the type of the phenomenon occured in the pure 4
model [24]. for a eld theory, the occurences or disappearances of the z2-symmetry restoration and z2dsb can be
seen through a comparison between the two regions of the parameter space where the z2ssb occurs respectively at the
classical and quantum levels. if there is a parameter region where the classical vacuum is asymmetric and the quantum
vacuum symmetric, then in that region, the symmetry breakdown phenomenon is compressed and z2-symmetry is
restored by quantum eects. if there is a parameter region where the classical vacuum is symmetrical and the quantum
vacuum asymmetrical, then in that region, the symmetry breakdown phenomenon is enhanced and z2-symmetry is
dynamically spontaneously broken by quantum eects. obviously, fig.1 in ref. [21] suggested the occurence of the
z2-symmetry restoration, but failed to give such a parameter region where the z2-symmetry restoration phenomenon
occurs. furthermore, we donot know if the z2dsb phenomenon really occurs in the 2d msgft. this paper will
address the above problems. within the framework of the gwfa, we shall continue to investigate the 2d msgft
with zero vacuum angle, explicitly give the region of the parameter space where the z2-symmetry is restored, discuss
z2dsb, and analyze the inuence of a nite temperature eect on them.

both the z2-symmetry restoration and z2dsb are interesting and important. they are the inverse of each other,
and can correspond to some phase transitions which occur at inverse directions. also they mirror some aspects of
quantum eects. besides, the z2-symmetry restoration is the reverse of the fate of the fase vacuum [25]. early
in 1981, rajaraman and lakshmi proposed at the rst time the concept of symmetry restoration and demonstrated
explicitly the restoration of the z2-symmetry in a special 2d 6 model [22], with the loop-expansion eective-potential
method [24]. later, a re-investigation of the same model appealing to the same method revealed the dependence of the
symmetry-restoring result upon the renormalization condition [26]. later again, a monte carlo numerical study about
another slightly dierent 2d 6 theory with three degenerate vacua showed that the quantum corrections make the
vacuum z2-symmetrical [27]. recently, we re-investigated the above two 6 models with the gwfa and demonstrated
well the restoration of the z2symmetry [28]. although the above two models can display the restoration of the z2-
symmetry, they (in the continuum, not the lattice case) are intrinsically dependent upon the renormalized condition
[26,28,29] 2, and the model in ref. [27] is little typical because its classical vacuum is three-fold degenerate. the 4
model is a good one for displaying the z2-symmetry restoration, and was investigated in various dimensions through
the gwfa [30]. in this paper, one will see that the msgft is also a good eld-theoretic example for displaying the
z2-symmetry restoration. as for the dynamical breakdown of the z2-symmetry, its existence was shown only in the
pure 4 model [24], and, to our knowledge, no other investigations demonstrated the occurrence of the z2dsb in
any other scalar eld theories. in this paper, we shall show that the 2d msgft also suers z2dsb.

as was mentioned above, for the 2d msgft, quantum eects can extend and also shrink the parameter region
where the classical vacuum is z2-symmetrical. then, when a nite temperature is introduced into the 2d msgft,
will the parameter regions of the z2-symmetry restoration and z2dsb by quantum eects be extended or shrinked
by the nite temperature eect? this is an interesting problem. when the z2-symmetry restoration region is
extended, or the z2dsb region is shrinked, we say the z2-symmetry is restored by a nite temperature eect [31].
this phenomenon is important in particle physics, cosmology and condensed matter physics [3133] [6](1996). in
the present paper, using the gwfa in thermoeld dynamics [34,33,35,36], we shall consider the inuence of a nite
temperature on the z2-symmetry for the 2d msgft with zero vacuum angle. one will see that for the 2d msgft,

1originally, dynamical symmetry breakdown was rst used to mean that the chiral symmetry enjoyed by the classical

lagrangian of the njl model is broken by quantum radiation corrections, to see ref. [23].
2here, the word intrinsically means that the dependence upon the renormalized condition is closely related to the intrinsic
nature of those two models themselves that there are three terms 2, 4 and 6 in the potential of each of the above two 6
models but there are only two parameters [28,29].

2

a nite temperature eect can further restore the z2-symmetry and would prevent quantum eects from dynamically
breaking the z2-symmetry.

for both the zero- and nite-temperature cases, this paper will make use of the gwfa for investigations. although
it is dicult to control the accuracy of the gwfa, the gwfa has succeeded in extracting the non-perturbative
information of many eld theoretical models [37,21]. so, we feel that for the z2-symmetry restoration and z2dsb
phenomena in the 2d msgft, the quantitative result of the gwfa is necessary and useful, at least, can provide a
basis and reference for further investigations.

this paper is organized as follows. sect.ii will discuss the classical vacuum of the 2d msgft so as to lay the
foundation for studying the z2-symmetry restoraton and z2dsb phenomena.
in sect.iii, we shall give the nite
temperature gaussian eective potential (ftgep), the zero-temperature limit of which is just the gaussian eective
potential (gep) of quantum eld theory. the restoration and dynamical breakdown of the z2-symmetry by quantum
eects will be investigated in sect.iv. in sect.v we shall consider the inuence of a nite temperature eect on the
zero-temperature results, and sect. vi will conclude this paper with a brief discussion.

ii. classical vacuum

in this section, we give a discussion about the classical aspects of the 2d msgft for the convenience of latter
analyses. although the analyses in the present section is simple, and some results are straightforward or were
mentioned in ref. [21], they are the basis of the investigation in this paper.

case of m0 = 0, eq.(1) describes the sgft, and when 2  0, eq.(1) describes a free theory with the squared mass
0 + m2 > 0). because | cos(x)|  1 (hereafter || represents absolute value), we have to maintain
(m2
0 in eq.(1) for avoiding an unbounded-below vacuum 4. similar to sgft [2], it is always viable to have
a positive m2
  0 because the sign of  is free to be redened. nevertheless, dierent from the sgft, both the positive and the
negative m2 should be considered in eq.(1) because the physics of the negative is not equivalent to the one of the
positive.

evidently, the lagrangian eq.(1) is invariant under the transformation of   . let us discuss if the z2-
symmetry of the lagrangian is enjoyed by the classical vacuum. consider the extremum condition of the classical
potential u () ( du()

intersection points of the three lines i,ii, and iii with the sine curve are the solutions of eq.(2) in the cases of
m2 = 1.2,0.5,0.1, respectively. from fig.1, it can be seen that the more near the negative ratio m2
m2
m2 is to zero,
0, m2 and , eq.(2) can have (2n + 1)
the greater the number of the solutions of eq.(2) is. in general, for any given m2
roots (here, n is a non-negative integer). when m2 < 0 and |m2|
< 1, eq.(2) has a unique zero root  = 0 because
m2
 > sin() for the case of  > 0. thus, both for the case of m2 > 0 and for the case of m2 < 0 with |m2| < m2
0, the
classical potential u () is absolutely minimized at  = 0, and so the classical vacuum is symmetrical and possesses
the same z2-symmetry with the lagrangian. in the other case, i.e., for any negative m2 with |m2| > m2
0, the situation
is completely dierent, and there exist 2n non-zero roots of eq.(2)  =  i (i = 1, 2, , n ) besides the zero root
 = 0, and u () gets to a maximum at  = 0 because d2u()
(d)2 of eq.(3) is negative at  = 0. then for the case of
0, the classical potential u () must be minimized at  =  1, 3, 5,, and z2-symmetry of
m2 < 0 with |m2| > m2
the classical vacuum is spontaneously broken. a further analysis indicates that the classical vacuum is located at + 1
or  1 which are nearest to the zero root. the parameter space corresponding to the symmetric and the asymmetric

phases of the classical vacuum is plotted in fig.2. for any  6= 0, on the parameter plane m2
the symmetric and the asymmetric vacua coexist corresponds to the ray, from the origin, with the slope 1, in the
fourth quadrant of the parameter plane (fig.2(a)), and the upper and lower regions of the boundary correspond to
the z2-symmetric and asymmetric vacua, respectively. for any given m2
0 6= 0, on the parameter plane m2-2, the
boundary where the symmetric and the asymmetric vacua coexist is the line m2 = m2
0 in the second quadrant of the
parameter plane (fig.2(b)), and the right region of the boundary corresponds to symmetric vacua, whereas the left
region to asymmetric vacua. as an explicit illustration, the classical potentials at  = 3.0 and m2
0 = 0.6 are depicted
in fig.3 for the cases of m2 = 6.0,0.5,3.0, and 6.0, respectively. (in the numerical computation, unit mass is
regarded as 1 and hence quantities concerned can be taken as dimensionless.)
when the classical vacuum is z2-symmetrical, the shape of the potential u () is mainly a single well, and when
the vacuum is asymmetrical, the shape of u () is dominated by a double wells. these, according to the above
simple analysis, are independent of the coupling parameter . moreover, the curvatures of the wells at their bottoms

in this section, we have given a wordy statement on the z2-symmetry of the classical vacuum. next, we shall give

the expression of the ftgep so as to discuss the z2-symmetry of quantum vacuum.

iii. finite temperature gaussian effective potential

the ftgep is the eective potential of nite temperature eld theory [33] obtained by the gaussian approximation.
there are several methods to calculate the ftgep [35], and those methods are equivalent to one another. this section
will calculate the ftgep for the system eq.(1) with the help of the gwfa in thermoeld dynamics [35](roditi) [36].
ref. [35](roditi) proposed the gwfa in thermoeld dynamics for the quantum-mechanical 4 model. in ref. [36],
we developed this method for a (d+1)-dimensional scalar eld theory with any potential whose fourier representation
exists in the sense of tempered distributions [38]. according to the formulae in ref. [36], in order to calculate the
ftgep of the 2d msgft, it is enough to complete some ordinary integrals because the system eq.(1) involves in the
type of eld systems in ref. [36]. hence, it is not necessary to give the derivation of the ftgep of the 2d msgft
in detail. additionally, thermoeld dynamics and its gwfa will be not introduced here, for they can be found in
ref. [33,34] and in ref. [36] (c1 in ref. [36] (page 744) should be c2), respectively.

now we shall give the ftgep for the system eq.(1). substituting u (x) of eq.(1) into eqs.(23) and (25) in

ref. [36] and performing some integrations, one can have the ftgep of the 2d msgft at any temperature t

minimum with respect to . besides, sometimes the non-zero solution of eq.(6) is multi-valued, and so in that case,

from ref. [36], the above formulae contain no divergences, and hence no further renormalization procedures need
to be performed. thus, eqs.(5),(6),(7) and the inequality eq.(9) can correctly give the ftgep for the 2d msgft.
from the ftgep, we can discuss the restoration and dynamical breakdown of the z2-symmetry. next, we begin in
the t = 0 case.

iv. quantum effects

as was mentioned in sect.i, for the system eq.(1), with the aid of the gwfa, ref. [21] showed the occurence of the
spontaneous z2-symmetry breakdown and gave the corresponding phase diagram of the parameter plane 2-m2
0. in
this section, we shall discuss further the phases of the quantum vacuum on the parameter planes 2-m2 and m2-m2
0
so as to explicitly analyse the inuence of quantum eects on the symmetry of vacuum 5.

5it is dicult for ref. [21] to explicitly discuss this inuence because the parameter m2 was not considered in the numerical
calculation there.

which are consistent with eqs.(4), (5), (6) and the inequality eq.(7) in ref. [21], respectively. from the discussion
in ref. [21], the gep v0 is governed by the nonzero root of eq.(11), which is also satised by the inequality, instead
of the end points 2 = 0 and 2  , and meanwhile, the coupling parameter 2 is constrained to the range of

perhaps one has noticed that there are only one critical value of  for the - m2

one can numerically calculate the gep at any xed m2
0 from eqs.(10)(14), and accordingly analyse the phases
of quantum vacuum on the parameter plane m2-2. from the numerical results, the phase diagram of the quantum
vacuum (a gure which indicates the regions on the parameter space where the corresponding vacua are z2-symmetrical
and asymmetrical, respectively) is depicted in the parameter plane m2-2 as fig.4. in this gure, the solid curve is the
boundary of the symmetric and asymmetric phases where the vacuum can be located either at 0 = 0 or at 0 6= 0,
i.e., at which the gep at 0 = 0 is equal to the one at 0 6= 0. on the right of the boundary, the quantum vacuum is
z2-symmetrical, whereas on the left, the z2-symmetry of quantum vacuum is spontaneously broken. the short-dashed
line corresponds to the solid vertical line in fig.2(b). thus, fig.4 indicates that the symmetry    is restored
by quantum eects in the domain i which is surrounded by the solid curve and the short-dashed line. obviously, for
the parameter m2, there is a critical value of m2
c no z2-symmetric vacuum can appear.
for any xed m2 with m2
c < m2 < 1.0, there are two critical values of , c1 and c2, at each of which the vacuum
is either symmetrical or asymmetrical, and for any  with c1 <  < c2, the vacuum is located at 0 = 0. for an
explicit illustration, we plot the gep in fig.5 for the case of m2 = 1.4. the curves ii and iv correspond to the two
critical cases. thus, one has seen that at any xed m2
0 phase diagram in ref. [21], whereas
c < m2 < 1.0. this dierence
in fig.6, the solid curve is the boundary
0 = 2(=0)
= m2
0 ), which corresponds to
0 of fig.1 in ref. [21], and the short- or tiny-dashed curves i,
c  1.68,1.3,1.001 and
c < m2 < 1.0,
in the above, the z2dsb phenomenon is not displayed on the parameter plane m2-. nevertheless, we dare not
rashly have a conclusion that no z2dsb can occur for the 2d msgft, because this theory has three parameters and
0-m2 is not considered still. now, we turn on it. letting the normal-ordering mass unit, and
the parameter plane m2
giving an explicit value of , we can discuss the phase diagram of quantum vacuum on the parameter plane m2
0-m2.
for the case of 2 = 3.0, we numerically solved eqs.(10)(13) (when m is unit, all quantities can be regared as
dimensionless ones), and the phase diagram on the parameter plane m2
0-m2 is plotted in fig.7 (only one part of the
fourth quadrant is given). in fig.7, the solid curve is the boundary between the symmetric and asymmetric phases, and

now on the plane - m2 the two critical values c1 and c2 exist for any m2 with m2
between the - m2 and - m2
between the symmtric and asymmetric phases on the plane 2
the long-dashed boundary in the parameter plane 2- m2
ii, iii, iv and v are plotted from the expression of 2
0.8, respectively. fig.6 indicates that in the parameter plane 2
such as the curve iii, intersects the solid curve at two points which correspond to c1 and c2.

the region above the solid curve corresponds to symmetric vacua and the region below the solid curve to asymmetric
vacua. the short-dashed line in this gure is the boundary in fig.2(a), and obviously the gure indicates that not
only the z2-symmetry restoration occurs in the upper-left region i between the solid curve and the short-dashed line,
but also the z2-symetry is dynamically spontaneously broken in the lower-right region ii between the solid curve and
the short-dashed line. in order to give an evident demonstration for the restoration and dynamical breakdown of the
z2-symmetry, the gep is depicted in fig.8 and fig.9, respectively. fig.8 is for the case of m2
0 = 1.5, and the curves
i, ii and iii correspond to m2 = 1.7,2.1526852 (the approximate critical value) and 3.0, respectively. in fig.9,
m2
0 = 8.0, and the curves i, ii and iii correspond to m2 = 5.0,6.3043705 (the approximate critical value) and
7.0, respectively. the dynamical breakdown of the z2-symmetry in the 2d msgft is consistent with assertion of
ref. [1] (notice the third footnote. in the paragraph above fig.2 of ref. [21], the second sentence frohlich [1] pointed
out  is misleading, and should be frohlich [1](the book) pointed out that for a suciently small m2
0 there may be
a phase transition. ). additionally, we also consider the eect of the parameter 2 on the phase diagram of the plane
m2-m2
0, and the result indicates that the intersection point of the solid boundary with the short-dashed boundary is
shifted up along the classical boundary with the increase of 2. that is to say, when increasing the value of 2, the
z2-symmetry restoration domain i gets smaller and the z2dsb domain ii larger. as a illustration, in fig.7, we also
plot the boundaries in the cases of  = 2.4 (the lower tiny-dashed curve) and  = 4.3 (the upper tiny-dashed curve).
in this section, we have explicitly demonstrated the existence of the restoration and the dynamical breakdown of
the z2-symmetry in the 2d msgft. next section, we shall analyse the ftgep to discuss the inuence of a nite
temperature eect on the results in this section.

which is the same as that in the case of t = 0 [21]. thus, 2 must be less than 8, and to calculate ftgep, we
should choose the nonzero root of eq.(16) instead of the end points  = 0 and    (of course, the root should
be satised by the inequality eq.(18)). the constrant of the parameters in the case of t 6= 0 is identical with that in
the case of t = 0.
now we can compute the ftgep and analyse the symmetry of the vacuum at t 6= 0. although the integrals k,
c2 and j2(g) have no simple analytical expressions, but it is easy to numerically compute them, and accordingly we
can numerically solve the eqs.(15)(18). for the convenience of a comparison, we shall do as the last section and
consider rst the phase diagram on the parameter plane m2-2 and then that on the plane m2

0-m2.

(19)

now we are in a position to consider the parameter plane m2

eqs.(15)(18) can be dimensionless, and we can numerically computed the ftgep at a given temperature and discuss
the symmetry of the vacuum on the parameter plane m2-2. fig.10 gives the numerical results at some temperatures.
in fig.10, the solid curves i,ii and iii are the boundaries between symmetric and asymmetric phases at t = 1
, 1

10kb
and 1
, respectively, the shapes of which are similar to that in fig.4, the short-dashed line corresponds to the classical
kb
boundary in fig.2(b), and the curve i coincides almost with the boundary in fig.4. at any temperature t , the
vacuum is asymmetrical on the left of the solid curve of fig.10 and symmetrical on the right. fig.10 indicates that a
nite temperature eect can further restore z2-symmetry of the quantum vacuum, and the z2-symmetry restoration
domain is the domain between the curves ii and i for the case of t = 1
and the one between the curves iii and i
2kb
for the case of t = 1
. it is evident that with the increase of the temperature the z2-symmetry restoration domain
kb
get larger and larger. as an illustration of the z2-symmetry restoration, for the case of m2 = 1.4 and t = 1
,
the ftgeps at  = 4.71, c2  4.635, 3.0, c1  1.105 and 0.85 are plotted as the curves i,ii,iii,iv and v in fig.11,
respectively.
0-m2. letting m unit, quantities in eqs.(15)(18)
can be regarded as dimensionless, and from eqs.(15)(18), we can compute numerically the ftgep at a given
0-m2. numerical analyses indicate
temperature and a given  for discussing the phases of the vacuum on the plane m2
that a nite temperature can restore further the z2-symmetry still, but cannot give rise to z2dsb. at  = 3.0, the
phase diagrams for some temperatures are plotted in fig.12, and the phase diagrams at any other  are similar to
fig.12. in fig.12, the solid curve is the boundary between the symmetric and asymmetric phases for t = 1
, at any
2kb
point of which vt ( = 0 = 0) is equal to vt ( = 0 6= 0) and the vacuum is either symmetrical or asymmetrical. for
the region above the boundary, the vacuum is symmetrical, whereas for the region below the boundary the vacuum is
asymmetrical. the upper and lower tiny-dashed curves are the boundaries for t = 1
, respectively, and the
6kb
upper tiny-dashed curve coincide almost with the corresponding boundary at t = 0, i.e., the solid curve in fig.7. for
a sucient large m2
0, the boundary at any t 6= 0 coincides presumably with the zero-temperature boundary 6. fig.12
indicates that the nite-temperature eect compresses the z2dsb domain at t = 0 and enlarge the z2-symmetry
restoration domain at t = 0. thus, the nite-temperature eect leads to no z2dsb but a further restoration of the
z2-symmetry. it is evident from fig.12 that the higher the temperature is, the larger the z2-symmetry restoration
domain is. for an illustration of the phase diagram and the z2-symmetry restoration by the nite temperature eect,
fig.13 and fig.14 give the ftgeps at  = 3.0 for some cases. in fig.13, the curves i, ii and iii are the ftgeps at
t = 1
0 = 1.5 in the cases of the m2 = 1.7,2.4821738 and 3.0, respectively, and meanwhile for the third

vi. conclusion

the z2-symmetry of the vacuum of the 2d msgft was investigated both in ref. [21] and this paper. ref. [21]
0-2 for the zero-temperature case and showed the existence of
gave the phase diagram on the parameter plane m2
z2ssb, whereas the present paper further gave the phase diagrams on the parameter planes m2-2 and m2
0-m2 both
for t = 0 and t 6= 0 cases and exhibited the inuences of quantum and nite temperature eects on the symmetry
of the vacuum. from this paper, the 2d msgft at the quantum level can suer not only the restoration of z2-
symmetry but also z2dsb, and a nite temperature eect can enlarge the z2-symmetry restoration phenomenon and
compress the z2dsb, namely, a nite temperature eect can further restore the z2-symmetry only. those conclusions
in the present paper are interesting and enhance our understanding on the 2d msgft. as was pointed out in the
introduction, the gwfa is believable, at least, qualitatively, albeit it is a simple approximation. in fact, our results
have conrmed and realized the inferences or predictions in refs. [1,15,16]. although an investigation with the help
of some better approximate methods [40] would perhaps have dierent numerical results about the 2d msgft, the
results in this paper will provide a basis and a reference at least, for to our knowledge, no quantitative results about
the restoration and dynamical breakdown of z2-symmetry in the 2d msgft existed in the literature.

perhaps some results in this paper can be conceivable from quantum mechanics 7. quantum eects altering the
z2-symmetry of the vacuum consists in that the dierences of calssical potential at dierent well-bottums (and/or eld
points) can be osetted by the corresponding dierences of quantum correstions of the potentials [22,24]. obviously,
occurrences of both the restoration and the dynamical breakdown of z2-symmetry have much to do with the depths
and the bottum curvatures of the wells of the classical potential (from quantum mechanics [41], the quantum correstion
to the classical energy gets more remarkable with the increase of the curvature of the bottm). from eqs.(3) and (4),
the curvatures of the well-bottums are governed by the parameters m2
0 and m2, and the depths of the wells by the
0 and m2. thus, the concrete results in this paper should be acceptable. in particular, some of them
parameters , m2
can be understood simply from the above statement. for example, one can have a straightforward understanding
about the existence of c1 because from sect.ii the depth of the z2-symmetry-broken well gets deeper and deeper
with the decrease of .

those gures about parameter planes and eective potentials in this paper indicated the existence of some phase
transitions. in ref. [21], we have discussed the phase transition releted to the parameters  and m0, at t = 0, and
our viewpoints about the phase transitions related to the present cases resemble those in ref. [21]. so here we discuss
them no longer. nevertheless, we want to mention the meaning of z2-symmetry in the massive schwinger model.
from the results here, the restoration and dynamical breakdown of the z2-symmetry is relevant to the negative m2.
this reminds us that the system eq.(1) with any negative m2 and 2 = 4 is equivalent to the massive schwinger
model with  vacuum angle and on the zero-charge sector 8.
it is known that the symmetry    is charge
conjugation in fermi language, and the symmetric vacuum in the 2d msgft corresponds to the disappearance of
half-asymptotic particles (quarks and antiquarks) in the massive schwinger model and the asymmetric vacuum to the
occurence of half-asymptotic particles in the massive schwinger model [15]. hence, the restoration of z2-symmetry
here implies a phase transition from a half-asymptotic-particle phase to a no-quark phase, and the z2dsb corresponds
to a inverse phase transition, i.e., a phase transition from a no-quark phase to a half-asymptotic-particle phase. this
is an intereting phenomenon and worthy of a detailed investigation.

finally, we also to mension that it is very dicult to extract a non-perturbative information when a nite-
temperature eect is introduced into a quantum eld theory. nevertheless, ref. [35,36] and the present paper has
indicated that the gwfa is a viable and eective tool for extracting the non-perturbative information of nite tem-
perature eld theories. with the aid of the gwfa, we have calculated the masses of the schwinger boson and its
two-particle bound states in ref. [21]. from this paper and ref. [36], after a nite temperature eect is introduced

7the behaviours in quantum eld theory have a bit of similarity to those in quantum mechanical case.
8in fact, when a statement in this paper is related to the comparison between the results here and the inference in ref. [15],
we have used this equivalence.

9

into the massive schwinger model, it will be still possible to calculate the masses of the schwinger boson and its
bound states. we believe that the gwfa will become an important tool in nite temperature eld theory.
