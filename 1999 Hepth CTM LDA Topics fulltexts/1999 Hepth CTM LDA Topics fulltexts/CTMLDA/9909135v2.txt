abstract

we introduce a new class of gauge eld theories in any complex dimension, based on
algebra-valued (p, q)-forms on complex n-manifolds. these theories are holomorphic
analogs of the well-known chern-simons and bf topological theories dened on real
manifolds. we introduce actions for dierent special holomorphic bf theories on com-
plex, kahler and calabi-yau manifolds and describe their gauge symmetries. candi-
date observables, topological invariants and relations to integrable models are briey
discussed.

introduction

topological eld theories [1, 2] were intensively studied, developed and generalized over the last
ten years (see e.g. [3] and references therein). among these theories, of particular interest are
non-abelian chern-simons gauge theories [2]. the chern-simons (cs) action functional is

scs = zx

tr (ada +

2
3

a  a  a),

(1.1)

where x is an oriented smooth 3-manifold, a is a connection 1-form on a principal g-bundle p
over x, and g is a lie group. the euler-lagrange equations for the action (1.1) are

fa = 0,

(1.2)

where fa = da + a  a is the curvature of a connection a. thus, non-abelian cs theories give
a eld-theoretic description of at connections on g-bundles over 3-dimensional manifolds x, and
expectation values of quantum observables for these theories are topological invariants of x [2, 3].
other interesting topological eld theories associated with at connections are so-called bf
theories [4] generalizing abelian models introduced in [5]. these theories can also be considered
as a generalization of chern-simons theories to arbitrary dimensions. the classical action for a
non-abelian bf theory has the following form:

sbf = zx

tr (b  fa),

(1.3)

where x is an oriented smooth n-manifold, fa is the curvature of a connection 1-form a on a
principal g-bundle p over x, and b is an (n  2)-form with values in the adjoint bundle adp =
p g g. we consider a semisimple lie group g and denote by g its lie algebra. the variation of the
action (1.3) w.r.t. b gives eqs.(1.2), and the variation of the action w.r.t. a gives the equations

dab = 0,

(1.4)

where da = d + ada is the covariant dierential on p . thus, bf theories describe at connections
a on bundles p over n-manifolds x and adp -valued da-closed (n  2)-forms b.

an interesting class of (topological) gauge models has been introduced by considering the clas-
sical limit of the string eld theory for open n = 2 topological strings on calabi-yau 3-folds [6, 7].
the corresponding action [6] is given by

shcsw = zz

  tr (a0,1 a0,1 +

2
3

a0,1  a0,1  a0,1),

(1.5a)

where  is a nowhere vanishing holomorphic (3, 0)-form on a calabi-yau 3-fold z, and a0,1 is the
(0, 1)-component of a connection 1-form a on a principal g-bundle p over z. the eld equations
following from the chern-simons-witten (csw) action (1.5a) are

f 0,2
a = a0,1 + a0,1  a0,1 = 0,

(1.5b)

where  is the (0, 1)-part of the exterior derivative d =  + , and f 0,2
a is the (0, 2)-part of the
curvature fa of a g-bundle p with a complex structure group g. recently holomorphic csw
theories (1.5) were discussed [8, 9] in the frames of the program on extending the results of casson,
floer and jones to calabi-yau (cy) threefolds.

our discussion can be summarized in the following diagram:

(1.6)

the arrows mean that one theory is a generalization of another one. notice that holomorphic
csw theories (1.5) are dened only in three complex dimensions by analogy with the fact that cs
theories (1.1) with the action linear in derivatives are dened only in three real dimensions. at the
same time, it is desirable to have a eld theory description of at (0, 1)-connections a0,1 (holomor-
phic structures) in arbitrary dimensions. the purpose of our paper is to introduce holomorphic bf
theories which generalize both topological bf theories (1.3) and holomorphic csw theories (1.5)
to complex n-manifolds and describe holomorphic structures on bundles in any complex dimen-
sion. we also introduce three special holomorphic bf theories and describe, in particular, stable
holomorphic bundles. so, our goal in this paper is to extend the diagram (1.6) to the diagram

2 holomorphic bf theories

2.1 non-abelian models

let z be a complex n-manifold, g a (complex) semisimple lie group, g its lie algebra, p a principal
g-bundle over z and a0,1 the (0, 1)-component of a connection 1-form a on p . components a0,1
of connections a will be called (0, 1)-connections. the curvature fa of a connection a splits into
components,

a + f 1,1

a + f 0,2
a ,

fa = f 2,0

3

where f 0,2
(0, 1)-part of the exterior derivative d =  + . we also split da = d + ada = a + a.

a = a0,1 + a0,1  a0,1 is the (0, 2)-component of the curvature tensor and  is the

let us consider the bundle of groups intp = p gg (g acts on itself by internal automorphisms:
h 7 ghg1, h, g  g) associated with p . we dene the innite-dimensional group of gauge
transformations as the group g = (z, intp ) of global smooth sections of the bundle intp . we also
consider the adjoint bundle adp = p g g of lie algebras and denote by p,q(z, adp ) the space of
smooth (p, q)-forms on z with values in the bundle adp , p, q, ... = 1, ..., n = dimcz.

for simplicity we shall consider bundles p that are equivalent to the trivial one as smooth
bundles (i.e. topologically trivial), p  z  g. therefore, we have intp  z  g, adp  z  g,
and adp -valued (p, q)-forms may be considered as g-valued (p, q)-forms on z. the space of such
forms is denoted by p,q(z, g). generalization to the case of topologically nontrivial bundles is
straightforward and not dicult.

let us consider the (0, 2)-component f 0,2

a of the curvature tensor of a connection 1-form on p

and a g-valued (n, n  2)-form b on z. we introduce the action

shbf = zz

tr (b  f 0,2

a ),

(2.1)

and models with such actions will be called holomorphic bf theories. the eld equations obtained
from the action (2.1) are

a0,1 + a0,1  a0,1 = 0,

b + a0,1  b  b  a0,1 = 0.

(2.2a)

(2.2b)

solutions a0,1 of eqs.(2.2a) will be called at (0, 1)-connections on p . notice that eqs.(2.2a)
coincide with the compatibility conditions 2
a = 0 of eqs.(2.2b). so, holomorphic bf theories
describe at (0, 1)-connections on p which correspond to holomorphic structures on the bundle
p  z.

by expanding a0,1 and b in the generators {j i} of the group g, one can rewrite eqs.(2.2) in

the form

ai +

1
2
bi + f i

jkaj  ak = 0,
f i

jkaj  bk = 0,

(2.3a)

(2.3b)

where a0,1 = aiji, b = biji, and f i
notice that eqs.(2.3b) can be rewritten in the form ab = 0, where a =  + ada0,1.

jk are structure constants of the group g, i, j, ... = 1, ..., dimcg.

the gauge group g acts on a (0, 1)-connection a0,1 on p and on a eld b  n,n2(z, g) by

the formulas

a0,1 7 adg1a0,1 = g1a0,1g + g1 g,

b 7 adg1b = g1bg,

(2.4a)

(2.4b)

where g  g. the action (2.1) is invariant under the transformations (2.4) and under the following
cohomological symmetry transformation:

where   n,n3(z, g). by virtue of this invariance, a is a trivial solution of eqs.(2.2b) for any
  n,n3(z, g), and solutions b and b + a of eqs.(2.2b) are considered as equivalent.

b 7 b + a,

(2.5)

4

we denote by n the space of solutions to eqs.(2.2a) and by m the set of orbits of the gauge

group g in the set n ,

let  be a projection

m = n /g.

 : n  m.

(2.6a)

(2.6b)

by denition, n is the space of at (0, 1)-connections (holomorphic structures) on the bundle p ,
and m is the moduli space of at (0, 1)-connections. put another way, the moduli space m of
holomorphic structures on p is the space of gauge inequivalent solutions to eqs.(2.2a).

equations (2.2b) are linear in b. for any xed at (0, 1)-connection a0,1 the space ba of

nontrivial solutions to eqs.(2.2b) is the (n, n  2)th dolbeault cohomology group

ba = h n,n2

a;p (z) :=

{b  n,n2(z, g) : ab = 0}
{b = a,   n,n3(z, g)}

,

(2.7)

which is dened to be the space of equivalence classes of a-closed g-valued (n, n  2)-forms on z,
modulo a-exact g-valued (n, n  2)-forms. so, the space of nontrivial solutions to eqs.(2.2b) forms
the vector space ba depending on a solution a0,1 of eqs.(2.2a). therefore the space of solutions
to eqs.(2.2) forms a vector bundle t  n , the base space of which is the space n of solutions to
eqs.(2.2a), and bers of the bundle t at the points a0,1  n are the vector spaces h n,n2
a;p (z) = ba
of nontrivial solutions to eqs.(2.2b).

recall that the gauge group g acts on solutions (a0,1, b) of eqs.(2.2) by formulas (2.4). there-
fore, identifying points (a0,1, b)  t and (g1a0,1g + g1 g, g1bg)  t for any g  g, we obtain
the moduli space

m = t /g

(2.8)

of solutions to eqs.(2.2). the space m is a vector bundle over the moduli space m of at (0, 1)-
connections. if we denote by [a0,1] the gauge equivalence class of a at (0, 1)-connection a0,1, then
the ber of this bundle at the point [a0,1]  m will be isomorphic to the dolbeault cohomology
group h n,n2
a;p (z). thus, non-abelian holomorphic bf theories give a eld-theoretic description of
holomorphic structures on bundles p  z and of the twisted dolbeault complex on z.

2.2 abelian models

in the abelian case, instead of a g-valued (0, 1)-connection on a bundle over a complex manifold z
one can take any (p, q  1)-form ap,q1  p,q1(z) and introduce the action

shab = zz

bnp,nq  ap,q1,

(2.9)

where bnp,nq  np,nq(z), i.e. bnp,nq is a c-valued (n  p, n  q)-form on z. equations of
motion following from (2.9) are

ap,q1 = 0,
bnp,nq = 0.

(2.10a)

(2.10b)

the action (2.9) and eqs.(2.10) are invariant under the following symmetry transformations:

ap,q1 7 ap,q1 + p,q2,

(2.11a)

5

bnp,nq 7 bnp,nq + np,nq1,

(2.11b)

where r,s  r,s(z). therefore the moduli space of solutions to eqs.(2.10) is a vector space

mhab = h p,q1



(z)  h np,nq



(z),

(2.12)

where h r,s
with a eld-theoretic description of the standard dolbeault complex on z.

 (z) is the (r, s)th dolbeault cohomology group of z. so, the action (2.9) provides us

3 special holomorphic bf theories

3.1 hermitian-yang-mills connections and stable bundles

let z be a kahler n-manifold with a kahler form , and gr be a subgroup of the unitary group
u (l) such that (gr)c = gr  c = g, l  2. we consider a (trivial) principal gr-bundle pr over z
and the (0, 1)-component a0,1 of a unitary connection 1-form a = a1,0 + a0,1 on pr.

recall that any unitary connection a on pr denes a holomorphic structure on a g-bundle p
over z if the (0, 1)-component a0,1 of a is at, i.e. satises eqs.(2.2a). connections a are called
hermitian-yang-mills connections, if their curvature fa satises the following equations [10]:

where

f 0,2
a = 0,
n1  f 1,1

a = 0,

f 0,2
a = a0,1 + a0,1  a0,1,

(3.1a)

(3.1b)

(3.2a)

(3.2b)
hermitian-yang-mills connections correspond to stable holomorphic structures a on a bundle [10],
but this is in some sense most of them.

f 1,1
a = a0,1 + a1,0 + a1,0  a0,1 + a0,1  a1,0.

notice that eqs.(3.1) can be rewritten in the form

f 0,2
a = 0,

f 1,1

a = 0,

(3.3a)

(3.3b)

where  is an algebraic trace operator which measures the component of a (1, 1)-form parallel to
 [10]. in local coordinates {za} on z, eqs.(3.3) have the form

fab = 0,
gabfab = 0,

(3.4a)

(3.4b)
where g = {gab} is a riemannian metric compatible with the complex structure on z. equa-
tions (3.3) appear in superstring theory from the condition of preserving at least one unbroken
supersymmetry in four dimensions after compactication of d = 10 superstrings on calabi-yau
3-folds [11].

the study of eqs.(3.1) or equivalent eqs.(3.3) is of interest because of their importance in
algebraic geometry and superstring theory. we introduce an action that leads to equations of
motion containing eqs.(3.1). namely, consider the action

shym = shbf + sf = zz

tr (b  f 0,2

a  n1  f 1,1
a ),

(3.5)

6

where  is a smooth g-valued function on z and  is a constant parameter. the action (3.5) is a
one-parameter deformation of the action shbf for holomorphic bf theories introduced in sect.2.1.
let us emphasize that the action shym depends on a kahler form  on z.

the eld equations following from the action (3.5) are

f 0,2
a = 0,

n1  f 1,1

a = 0,

b + a0,1  b  b  a0,1 = (n1) + n1  [a1,0, ],

(n1) + n1  [a0,1, ] = 0,

(3.6a)

(3.6b)

(3.6c)

where [, ] is the standard commutator in the lie algebra g. we see that eqs.(3.6a) coincide with
eqs.(3.1) and therefore a = a1,0 + a0,1 is a hermitian-yang-mills connection. it is obvious that if
 = 0, then eqs.(3.6) coincide with eqs.(2.2) of a holomorphic bf theory.

3.2 holomorphic bf theories on calabi-yau manifolds

let now z be a calabi-yau n-fold. this means that besides a complex structure, on z there exist
a kahler 2-form , a ricci-at kahler metric g and a nowhere vanishing holomorphic (n, 0)-form
. the (n, 0)-form  can be taken to be covariantly constant w.r.t. the levi-civita connection.
we consider a (trivial) principal g-bundle p over z and the (0, 1)-component a0,1 of a connection
1-form a on p .

for bundles p over calabi-yau (cy) n-folds z one can consider holomorphic bf theories with
the action (2.1) which does not depend on kahler structures, metrics and holomorphic (n, 0)-forms
on z. but the existence on z of a nowhere degenerate holomorphic (n, 0)-form  permits one to
introduce one more class of models which will be called holomorphic bf theories. their action
has the form

shbf = zz

  tr (b  f 0,2

a ),

(3.7)

where b is a g-valued (0, n  2)-form on z, and f 0,2
a = a0,1 + a0,1  a0,1 is the (0, 2)-component
of the curvature tensor of a connection a on p . the action (3.7) leads to the equations of motion

  f 0,2

a = 0,

  ( b + a0,1  b  (1)nb  a0,1) = 0

which are equivalent to the equations

a0,1 + a0,1  a0,1 = 0,

b + a0,1  b  (1)nb  a0,1 = 0.

(3.8)

(3.9a)

(3.9b)

in abridged notation, eqs.(3.9b) can be rewritten as ab = 0.

from eqs.(3.9) we see that holomorphic bf theories describe holomorphic structures on bun-
dles p  z and a-closed forms b  0,n2(z, g). solutions to eqs.(3.9a) are at (0,1)-connections
and for any xed at (0, 1)-connection a0,1 on p the space of nontrivial solutions to eqs.(3.9b) is
the (0, n  2)th dolbeault cohomology group

h 0,n2

a;p :=

{b  0,n2(z, g) : ab = 0}
{b = a,   0,n3(z, g)}

.

(3.10)

so, the action (3.7) provides us with a eld-theoretic description of the dolbeault complex coupled
to a at (0, 1)-connection on the adjoint bundle adp over a calabi-yau n-fold z.

3.3 special hbf theories on twistor spaces of self-dual 4-manifolds

let us consider a riemannian real 4-manifold m with self-dual weyl tensor (a self-dual manifold)
and the bundle  : z  m of complex structures on m (the twistor space of m ) with cp 1 as a
typical ber [12, 13]. the twistor space z of a self-dual 4-manifold m is a complex 3-manifold [13]
which is the total space of a ber bundle over m associated with the bundle of orthonormal frames
on m .

it is well known that yang-mills instantons on m can be described in terms of holomorphic
bundles over the twistor space z of m . namely, there is a one-to-one correspondence between self-
dual bundles (bundles with self-dual connections) over m and holomorphic bundles p over z that
are holomorphically trivial on any projective line cp 1
x  z parametrized by x  m [14, 15, 13].
the condition of holomorphic trivializability of the bundle p after the restriction of p to every
projective line in z is equivalent to the equality to zero of the restriction of the (0, 1)-component
a0,1 of a connection a on p to submanifolds cp 1
x  z, x  m (see [16] for discussions). such
connections on p can be described in terms of holomorphic bf theories on z by adding a term to
the action (2.1). in this way we obtain a model which describes the instanton moduli space and
diers from the donaldson-witten model.

consider the twistor space z of a self-dual real 4-manifold m . by denition, z is a complex
bered 3-manifold with the canonical projection  : z  m . the typical ber cp 1 has the su (2)-
invariant complex structure (see [17] for more details), and the vertical distribution v = ker 
inherits this complex structure. a restriction of v to each ber cp 1
x , x  m , is the tangent bundle
to that ber. the levi-civita connection on the riemannian manifold m generates the splitting
of the tangent bundle t (z) into a direct sum

t (z) = v  h

(3.11)

of the vertical v and horizontal h distributions. using the complex structures on cp 1 and z, one
can split the complexied tangent bundle of z into a direct sum

t c(z) = t 1,0  t 0,1 = (v 1,0  h1,0)  (v 0,1  h0,1)

(3.12)

of subbundles of type (1, 0) and (0, 1). analogously one can split the complexied cotangent bundle
of z into a direct sum of subbundles t1,0 and t0,1. so we have the (integrable) distribution v 0,1 of
(0, 1)-vector elds.

let e3,3 be a g-valued (3, 3)-form on z, and v 0,1 be an arbitrary (0,1)-vector eld from the
distribution v 0,1. denote by {ea}, {ea}, {a} and {a} local frames for the bundles t 1,0, t 0,1, t1,0
and t0,1, respectively. then locally

e3,3 = ea1...a3a1  ...  a3,

v 0,1 = v aea, a0,1 = a0,1

a a,

(3.13)

where a1, a1, ... = 1, 2, 3. let us consider the contraction

v 0,1

y e3,3

(3.14a)

of v 0,1 with e3,3, which is a g-valued (3, 2)-form on z. in the local frames, the form (3.14a) has
components

we also introduce a g-valued function

(v 0,1

y e3,3)a1a2a3 a1 a2 := 3v a3ea1a2a3 a1 a2a3.

v 0,1

y a0,1 = v aa0,1

on z and notice that

since e3,3  a0,1  0.

(v 0,1

y e3,3)  a0,1 = e3,3(v 0,1

y a0,1)

(3.15)

to the action (2.1) of a holomorphic bf theory we add the term

svae =  zz

tr [(v 0,1

y e3,3)  a0,1],

where  = const. the action

shbf + svae = zz

tr [b3,1  f 0,2

a  (v 0,1

y a0,1)e3,3]

leads to the following eld equations:

a0,1 + a0,1  a0,1 = 0,

v 0,1

y a0,1 = 0,

b3,1 + a0,1  b3,1  b3,1  a0,1 = v 0,1

y e3,3.

(3.16)

(3.17)

(3.18a)

(3.18b)

equations (3.18a) on the twistor space z of a self-dual 4-manifold m are equivalent to the self-dual
yang-mills (sdym) equations on m , which was discussed in detail in [16, 17]. equations (3.18b)
describe some elds interacting with external self-dual gauge elds on m . it is obvious that in the
limit   0, eqs.(3.18) are reduced to eqs.(2.2) of holomorphic bf theories on z.

3.4 conformal and integrable eld theories related to special hbf theories

it is well known that chern-simons theories on 3d real manifolds x are reduced to 2d conformal
eld theories (cft) if one supposed that a 3-manifold x has the form of a trivial bundle  
r (or   s1), where  is a 2-manifold [2, 18].
it is reasonable to expect that holomorphic
analogs of chern-simons and bf theories dened on a 3d complex manifold z (six real dimensions)
can be reduced to 4d cfts if one supposes that z is a bundle over a real 4-manifold m with
two-dimensional bers. one important example of a conformal eld theory in four dimensions is
provided by the sdym model. in sect.3.3 we have described the reduction of holomorphic bf
models on z to sdym models on self-dual 4-manifolds m . for discussions of reductions to other
4d cfts, see [16].

notice that hermitian-yang-mills connections (see sect.3.1) on bundles p over complex 2-
dimensional kahler manifolds are self-dual connections since eqs.(3.6a) for n = 2 coincide with the
sdym equations. thus, both the action (3.5) with n = 2 and the action (3.17) describe sdym
models on 4-manifolds. in the simplest case of the at 4-space, we obtain sdym models on r4. it is
well known that almost all integrable equations in 1  d  3 dimensions (bogomolny, korteweg-de
vries, nonlinear schrodinger, boussinesq, nahm and many others) can be obtained by reductions
of the sdym equations on r4 (see [19, 20] and references therein). thus, special holomorphic bf
theories are connected with 4d cfts and integrable models in 1  d  4 dimensions.

4 observables and topological invariants

to introduce observables and topological invariants for holomorphic bf and bf theories we use the
results on holomorphic analogs of chern-simons theories dened on calabi-yau 3-folds [6, 7, 8, 9].

first, for an action s coinciding with (2.1), (2.9) or (3.7), one can write down the partition

function

zk = za/g

da0,1 exp(iks),

(4.1)

where k  z, and the path integral is evaluated over the space a/g of gauge inequivalent (0, 1)-
connections a0,1 on a bundle p  z.

second, using the semiclassical approximation, one can give the partition function interpretation

of the ray-singer holomorphic torsion [21] of the holomorphic bundle (adp, a).

third, one can introduce an analog of wilson loops for abelian (0, 1)-connections a0,1 on a line
bundle l  z [9]. for this one should x complex curves ci  z (e.g. tori), holomorphic 1-forms
i on the cis and dene

t (ci) = exp(ikzci

i  a0,1)

(4.2)

as an element of the jacobian of l paired against i and exponentiated. then we can consider the
path integral

za/g

da0,1 exp(iks)

t (ci)

yi=1

(4.3)

m

and try to prove that it is an invariant of the complex structure of a manifold z.

finally, for abelian holomorphic bf theories with the action (2.9) one can introduce the dol-
beault currents [22] and dene the linking number of complex submanifolds of a manifold z using
a pairing h p,q

(z)  c of the dolbeault cohomology groups.

5 conclusion

in this paper we have introduced new classes of gauge eld theories which are natural holomorphic
analogs of bf topological theories. these holomorphic bf theories give a eld-theoretic description
of holomorphic structures on bundles over complex n-manifolds. three special holomorphic bf
theories on kahler, calabi-yau and bered complex manifolds have been introduced. in particular,
we have introduced an action describing hermitian-yang-mills connections on stable holomorphic
bundles. such connections satisfy the donaldson-uhlenbeck-yau equations and are often used in
superstring theory in the description of compactied congurations with unbroken supersymmetry
in four dimensions.

there are many open problems that have to be considered. in particular, it is necessary to
analyze the ghost structure of the introduced theories, to perform brst gauge xing and write
down quantum actions. supersymmetrization of holomorphic bf theories may be of interest. the
problem of nding nontrivial observables and their metric independence should be more carefully
analyzed. much work remains to be done.
