(13) write standard basis v easily obtain (+ + + + )g0 |i+ (+ + + + ) |i = 0. taking account non-supersymmetric case |i g0 |i satisfy vanishing conditions v therefore nd operators acting two basis vectors must vanish identically. however, results ++ = 0 hence = (++) |i = 0. therefore sum direct. furthermore, highest weight vector |i = |i|i . construction vectors |i contained v thus also v v. finally, one easily checks (1)f |i g0 eigenvalue . therefore v v contained sum v v v v 2 let us try diagonalise g0 l0-grade spaces v . dene l = r + l c 24 . (14) assume l 6= 0 take operator l u (r vectors 1 {g0}). easy see l l, = (g0l ll) |i , (15) - non-trivial - eigenvectors g0 eigenvalues l. again, (1)f interpolating vectors +l l, l l, 6= 0. l0-grade space v 24 + l = c l l 6= 0 therefore also diagonal g0 action. respect verma module v change basis involves 4 vectors l |i, g0l |i, lg0 |i, g0lg0 |i transforming 4 g0-eigenvectors l l,. surely, cases = c 24 two vectors would obviously trivial basis transformation breaks down. case 4 vectors proportional plays important role later considerations. assume lg0 |i = g0l |i easily obtain g0lg0 |i = 2 l l |i. rst relation true |i, also true g0 |i thus 2l |i = g0lg0 |i. comparing two last conditions nally results 2 l 2 = 2. hence, two proportionality factors allowed grouping vectors two proportional pairs. case, however, set 4 vectors l |i, g0l |i, lg0 |i, g0lg0 |i denes 2-dimensional vector space whose basis transforms l l, = (l )(g0l ll) |i , l l, = (l )(g0l ll) |i . (16) (17) hence, either case two possible proportionality factors one vectors l trivial also one vectors l l, would l, would vanish. therefore, two-dimensional 8 highest weight representations n = 1 ramond algebra one dimensional g0-eigenspace v space dened l |i, g0l |i, lg0 |i, g0lg0 |i would transformed one- dimensional g0-eigenspace v , one g0-eigenvalue l l one. case l = 0 nd half operators l cannot diagonalised respect g0. corresponding vectors g0l |i hence eigenvectors g0 eigenvalue 0. vectors generated half operators cannot transformed basis g0-eigenvectors square g0 diagonal them. theorem 2.h operator g0 diagonalised l0-grade spaces v l 6= 0. eigenvalues l appear except case proportionality among pairs vectors g0l |i lg0 |i l u (r 1 {g0}). case eigenvalues l shared among verma modules v. l = 0 g0 cannot diagonalised corresponding l0-grade space v . level 0. = c c 24 verma module v c 24 |0i = g0(cid:12)(cid:12) l 6= 0, (l > 0). however, v c 24 24(cid:11). g0 easily diagonalised whole verma module v fact g0 cannot diagonalised appears supersymmetric case already contains one unextended verma module generated 0 explained 24(cid:11) one example. 0 . vectors 0 belong (unextended) verma module built contains (unextended) verma module v theorem 2.i verma module v c 24 v c 24 (unextended) highest weight vector (i.e. g0-eigenvector). lie outside v consists vectors outside v c 0 , (cid:12)(cid:12) . 2 24 2 conversely, given verma module unextended ramond algebra (only one) highest weight vector |i g0 eigenvalue 6= 0 hence l0-eigenvalue 24 easily obtain v considering |i together partner |i = = 2 + c (1)f |i g0-eigenvalue imposing |i = |i|i . automatically implies g0 |i = |i+|i case = 0 simply add g0 = |0i v order obtainh v c 0 . notion singular vectors extended unextended verma modules furthermore g0 applied singular vector produces another singular vector non-trivial. therefore, highest weight representation extended r1 algebra irreducible (i.e. singular vectors), two subrepresentations unextended algebra obviously also irreducible. conversely, irreducible representation unextended algebra built |i, 6= 0, verma module r1 built |i constructed |i |i also irreducible. since rather simple transform highest weight representations extended ramond algebra highest weight representations unextended algebra conversely, justied restrict extended ramond algebra r1 turns suitable considerations cartan subalgebra lie algebra. furthermore, applications physics usually require distinguish bosonic fermionic states therefore extended algebra important physics. verma module one usually denes inner product dening l+ = lm , g+ = gm z , (18) obvious linear hermitian extensions universal enveloping algebra. one sets h| l0 = h| h| r 1 0. consequently denes inner product vectors x |i |i, x, u (r1) via h| x +y |i , (19) hnote v c 24 also r1 module, case v 6= c 24 . highest weight representations n = 1 ramond algebra 9 dene h| g0 |i = 0 since (1)f diagonal two states. obtain (pseudo- )norm vector x |i, x u (r1) h| x +x |i. singular vector whole embedded verma module built obviously vanishing (pseudo-)norms. furthermore, every vector contained largest proper submodule v vanishing (pseudo-)norm11. vectors form kernel inner product matrix formed via eq.
