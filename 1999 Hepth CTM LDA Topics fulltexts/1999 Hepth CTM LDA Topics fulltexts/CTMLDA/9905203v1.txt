abstract

we show that the degeneracy of topological solitons in the gauged o(3) non-
linear sigma model with chern-simons term may be removed by chosing a self-
interaction potential with symmetry - breaking minima. the topological solitons in
the model has energy,charge,ux and angular momentum quantised in each topo-
logical sector.

the 2+1 dimensional o(3) nonlinear sigma model has been studied extensively over a
long period of time[1] due to its own interest of providing topologically stable soliton solu-
tions which are exactly integrable in the bogomolnyi limit [2] and also for its applications
in condensed matter physics [3].soliton solutions of the model modied by the addition
of hopf term characterising maps from s 3 to s 2 reveal the occurence of fractional spin
and statistics [4,5]. the system can be cast in the form of a genuine gauge theory by the
inclusion of the chern - simons (c-s) term which implements fractional spin and statistics
in the context of local eld theories .a gauge-independent analysis [6] of the o(3) sigma
model with c-s term [7] shows conclusively that this fractional spin is a physical eect
and not an artifact of the gauge.the fractional spin of the topologically stable solitons of
the model were shown to scale as the square of the vortex number .it is also established
that this property is not specic of the particular model [8-11] and rather shared by the
chern-simons vortices in general [12].

a characteristic feature of the soliton solutions of the o(3) sigma model in (2+1)
dimensions is its scale - invariance which prevents particle interpretation on quantisation
[13]. an interesting method of breaking this scale-invariance is to gauge the u(1) subgroup
as well as including a potential term [14].recently it has been shown that gauging the
u(1) subgroup by chern - simons term with a particlar potential gives rise to both
topological and nontopological solitons[15]. however the topological solitons are innitely
degenerate in a given topo- logical sector with quantised energy but degenerate charge ,
ux and angular momentum .this is certainly very characteristic outcome in the light of
the ndings detailed above about the chern - simons vortices.

the potential used in [15] has two discrete minima 3 = 1 and the u(1) symmetry
is not spontaneously broken.the topologically stable soliton solutions of the model are
classied according to the homotopy 2(s2) = z just as the model without the gauge
eld coupling.the observed innite degeneracy in each topological sector is thus physi-
cally undesirable .in the present letter we will show that inclusion of a dierent form of
self-interaction with symmetry breaking minima leads to topologically stable soliton so-
lutions which have all the desired features with quantised energy,charge,ux and angular
momentum in each topological sector.

the lagrangian of our model is given by

l =

d  d +

k

aa + u()

(1)

here  is a triplet of scalar elds constituting a vector in the internal space with unit
norm

a = na  , (a = 1, 2, 3)

(2)

   = aa = 1

(3)

where na constitute a basis of unit orthogonal vectors in the internal space. we work in
the minkowskian space - time with the metric tensor diagonal, g = (1, 1, 1).

d is the covariant derivative given by

d =  + an3  

(4)

the so(2) (u(1)) subgroup is gauged by the vector potential a whose dynamics is
dictated by the cs term.the potential

u() = 

1
2k2 2

3(1  2
3)

(5)

gives a self interaction of the elds a.note that the minima of the potential arise when
either,

1 = 2 = 0 and 3 = 1
2 = 1

or, 3 = 0 and 2

1 + 2

(6)
(7)

in (6) the u(1) symmetry is unbroken whereas (7) corresponds to the spontaneous break-
ing of the same.for obvious reasons we will refer to (6) as the symmetric minima and (7)
as the symmetry breaking minima.

the euler - lagrange equations of the system (1) is derived subject to the constraint

(3) by the lagrange multiplier technique

using (8) we get

from (9) we nd

where b = curla is the magnetic eld. integrating (12) over the entire space we obtain

 =

k

(13)

where q is the charge and  is the magnetic ux.the relation (13) is characteristic of the
cs theories.

the energy functional is now obtained from schwingers energy - momentum tensor

[16] which in the static limit becomes

e =

(14)

we have eliminated a0 using (10) and (12).the energy functional (14) is subject to the
constraint (3). we can construct a conserved current

k =

1
8

[  d  d  f 3]

by a straightforward calculation it can be shown that

k  = 0

the corresponding conserved charge is

t = z d2xk0

using (15) and (17) we can write

t = z d2x[

ij  (i  j)] +

where r, are polar coordinates in the physical space and a = e  a.

(15)

(16)

(17)

(18)

let us now consider the symmetric minima (6).for nite value of the energy functional
(14) we require the elds at the spatial innity to be equal to either 3 = 1or  1.the
physical innity is thus one point compactied to either the north or the south pole
of the internal sphere.the static eld congurations are thus classied according to the
degree of the mapping from s2 to s2.note that the rst term of (18) gives the winding
number of the mapping [3].but 3  1 on the boundary.as a result the value of the
topological charge is not quantised.so the static nite energy solutions corresponding to

4

the symmetric minima are nontopological.unlike [15] topological solitons are not obtained
in this limit.these observations may be compared with earlier ndings about the chern
- simons solitons [17].

the situation changes dramatically when we consider the symmetry breaking minima

(7).here the physical vaccua bear representation of the u(1) symmetry.

  ein

(19)

where  = 1 +i2 and n gives the number of times the innite circle of the physical space
circuitting around the equatorial circle of the internal sphere.the topological solitons of
the model are now classied according to this winding number.when the equatorial circle
is traversed once the physical space is mapped on a hemisphere of the internal sphere.in
general the topological charge (18) will be quantised by

t =

n
2

allowing half integral values of t.

using the denition of  we can write

di  di = |(i + iai)|2 + (i3)2

(20)

(21)

from (14) and (21) we observe that for nite energy congurations we require the covariant
derivative (i + iai) to vanish at the physical boundary.using (19) we then get on the
boundary

a = e

n
r

(22)

it is really interesting to observe that the asymptotic form (22) is sucient to nd the

magnetic ux ,charge q and spin s. thus the magnetic ux

 = z bd2x = zboundary

ard = 2n

and spin [6,12]

s = 

k

2 zboundary

i[xia2  aixjaj]d2x = kn2

using (13) and (23) we then nd

q = 2kn

(23)

(24)

(25)

equations (23) to (25) show that the soliton solutions corresponding to the symmetry
breaking vaccua have charge,ux and angular momentum quantised in each topological
sector.

we then turn to show that the model satises bogomolnyi conditions. rearrenging

(14) we can write [18]

e =

1

2 z d2x[

2

(di  ij  dj)2 +

k2

1  2

3

(f12 

1
k2 3(1  2

3))2]  4t

equation (26) gives the bogomolnyi conditions

di  ij  dj = 0

f12 

1
k2 3(1  2

3) = 0

(26)

(27)

(28)

which minimises the energy functional in a particular topological sector, the upper sign
corresponds to +ve and the lower sign corresponds to -ve value of the topological charge.the
equations can be handled in the usual method[3,15] to show that the scale invariance is
removed by the artice of the gauge-eld coupling.

we will now show the consistency of (27) and (28) using the well-known ansatz[14,19]

1(r, ) = sin f (r) cos n
2(r, ) = sin f (r) sin n
3(r, ) = cos f (r)
na(r)

a(r, ) = e

r

from (7) we observe that we require the boundary condition

and equation (22) dictates that

f (r)  


2

as r  

a(r)  1 as r  

(29)

(30)

(31)

remember that equation (22) was obtained so as the solutions have nite energy. again
,for the elds to be well dened at the origin we require

f (r)  0or and a(r)  0 as r  0

substituting the ansatz(29) into (27) and (28) we nd that

n(a + 1)

f (r) = 
r
nk2 sin2 f cos f

a(r) = 

sin f

r

6

(32)

(33)

(34)

where the upper sign holds for +ve t and the lower sign corresponds to -ve t.equations
(33) and (34) are not exactly integrable.they may be solved numerically subject to the
appropriate boundary conditions to get the exact proles.

using the ansatz (29) we can explicitly compute the topological charge t by perform-

ing the integration in (18).the result is

t = 

n
2

[cosf ()  cosf (0)]

(35)

so we nd that according to (30) and (32) t = n
2 which is in agreement with our
observation (20).note that f(0) corresponds to +ve t and f(0) =  corresponds to -ve t.
if we take +ve t we nd f(r) bounded between 0 and 
2 is consistent with (30),(32) and
(33).again a(r) bounded between 0 and -1 is consistent with (31),(32) and (34).thus for
+ve topological charge the ansatz (29) with the following boundary conditions

f (0) = 0 a(0) = 0

f () =


2

a() = 1

(36)

is consistent with the bogomolnyi conditions. similarly the consistency may be veried
for -ve t.

to conclude,we nd that gauging the u(1) subgroup of the nonlinear o(3) sigma model
along with the inclusion of a self-interaction potential with degenerate minima where the
u(1) symmetry is spontaneously broken provides topologically stable soliton solutions
which have the desirable feature of the removal of scale invariance with quantised en-
ergy,charge,ux and angular momentum pertaining to each topological sector in contrast
to [15] where such solutions are innitely degenerate.this breaking of the degeneracy is
ascribed to the topology of the minima of the potential considered in our model.we have
demonstrated that the theory satises bogomolnyi conditions and discussed the consis-
tency of the solutions.detailed calculations of the proles are pending with other related
issues.we propose to take up these works subsequently.

ments.i also thank professor c.k.majumdar,director s.n. bose national centre for basic

are due to the referee for his comments which largely enabled me to put the work in
proper perspectives.
