introduction

microcausality is a fundamental postulate in relativis-
tic quantum eld theory. mathematically, it states that
two local operators o1(x) and o2(y) at space-time posi-
tions x and y must commute if x  y is a space-like dis-
tance. physically, it means that signals cannot be trans-
mitted faster than with the velocity of light, c. imposing
the requirement of microcausality eliminates a large class
of possible quantisation schemes. for instance, quantis-
ing scalar elds with anti-commutators violates micro-
causality, enforcing quantisation of scalars in terms of
commutators. along these lines, the celebrated spin-
statistics theorem [1] is established.

in this letter we demonstrate that the popular method
of front form (ff) or light-cone (lc) quantisation [2]
leads to a breakdown of microcausality when space-time
is compactied to a cylinder with the periodic direction
being chosen as light-like. as the momenta conjugate to
this direction become discrete, the method is usually re-
ferred to as discretized light-cone quantisation (dlcq)
[3,4].
its range of applicability has recently been ex-
tended to include m-theory [5].

we will be concerned with a massive scalar eld in d
space time dimensions. after some general remarks we
will actually specialise to d =2. our notations and con-
ventions are

x = x0  xd1 ,
x  k = gxk ,

k = k0  kd1 ,
g+ = g+ = 1/2 .

ff quantisation (for a recent review see [6]) amounts to
prescribing eld commutators on the quantisation sur-
face x+ = 0. this is a hyperplane tangent to the lc
which in d = 2 collapses to a light ray.

it has been shown by a number of authors [79], that
quantisation on just one light-like surface is ambiguous.
knowledge of initial conditions on two quantisation sur-
faces, say x+ = 0 and x = 0, is necessary in order
to have a well-posed (characteristic) initial-value prob-
lem [9]. as a result, the characteristic initial values
uniquely determine solutions to the klein-gordon equa-
tion for all x larger than the initial ones.

in 1994, however, heinzl and werner [9] were able to
show that the introduction of periodic boundary condi-
tions (pbc) in x direction (assumed to be compact)
uniquely determines the elds on the second quantisa-
tion surface, x = 0, in terms of the elds on the rst
quantisation surface, x+ = 0. an innite-volume formu-
lation of this problem, however, is rather involved and in
general will require the use of distribution theory [10,11].
it will not be addressed in this letter. we will rather re-
strict to the nite-volume case and show that prescribing
light-like bcthough solving the initial-value problem
is in conict with microcausality. the results presented
here are built upon the ph.d. thesis [12] where the loss of
causality in dlcq has been reported for the rst time.
recently, this nding has been conrmed by other re-
searchers [10].

violation of microcausality

a. generalities
we start with a free scalar eld  in d space-time dimen-
sion. the commutator of two free scalar elds is of course
known for all times (i.e. everywhere in minkowski space),
[(x), (0)] = i(x). (x) denotes the pauli-jordan [13]
or schwinger [14] function,

(x) =

1

i z

ddk
(2)d1 (k2  m2) sgn(k0) eikx.

(3)

as the sign of k0 does not change under proper or-
thochronous lorentz transformations,   l
+, if k2 is
spacelike,  is a lorentz invariant function. the sign
function in addition guarantees that  is antisymmetric,
(x) = (x), as is necessary for a commutator.
it is well known that (x) obeys microcausality. this
is the statement that (x) has to vanish for x space-like,
i.e. x2 < 0. a very elegant argument to see this is due to
gasiorowicz [15]. for x2 < 0, there is a lorentz transfor-
mation   l
+ that takes x to x, thus, by invariance,
(x) = (x), for x2 < 0. therefore, outside the lc,
 is both symmetric and antisymmetric in x and must
vanish. the argument does not work for d = 2, as the

1

regions x1 > 0 and x1 < 0 are disconnected. neverthe-
less, causality also holds in d = 2, as one can see upon
evaluating (3) for this case,

(x) = 
= 

1
2
1

sgn(x0)(x2)j0(mx2) ,
4(cid:2)sgn(x+) + sgn(x)(cid:3)j0(mx2) ,

(4)

which indeed vanishes outside the lc (here j0 denotes
the bessel function). the restrictions of (4) to x0 = 0
and x+ = 0 yield the canonical commutators of the two
quantisation schemes [6].

in (4) we have given both the if and ff versions of
 which are, of course, simply related by the coordinate
transformation (1). these two forms can actually be rep-
resented as one dimensional integrals by performing the
energy integrations over k0 and k, respectively,

does not. this is a consequence of the klein-gordon
equation [9]. in what follows we will show that, unlike
if , f f does not obey microcausality, i.e. does not
vanish for x2  x+x < 0.
in addition, we nd that
f f does not converge to  in the innite volume limit.
it actually turns out that bc in a light-like direction are
quite generally incompatible with causality.

b. numerical results
in general, the sums (8) and (9) cannot be evaluated
analytically. therefore we have calculated them numer-
ically. the summation cuto n has been chosen suf-
ciently large to establish numerical convergence. the
results are shown in fig. 1 and fig. 2.

the on-shell values of the energies are given by k =
1 +m2)1/2 and k = m2/k+. note the restriction of the
(k2
integration in (6) which is due to the positivity of the lon-
gitudinal momentum k+. both representations (5) and
(6) can be integrated and yield (4). as a cross check we
note that (5) and (6) are still related by the coordinate
transformation (1) applied to the on-shell momenta,

k = k  k1 = qk2

1 + m2  k1 .

(7)

this makes the positivity of k+ explicit and entails
that the integration measures are related by the singu-
lar transformation dk1/k = dk+/k+. let us now in-
vestigate how (5) and (6) get modied in a nite vol-
ume. to this end we restrict the spatial coordinates,
l  x1, x  l, and impose pbc for the eld .
the conjugate momenta become discrete, k1
n  n/l
and k+
n  2n/l, respectively. the nite volume repre-
sentations are dened by replacing the integrals (5) and
(6) by the discrete sums,

where the limit n   is understood. the on-
shell energies for discrete momenta are dened as
n = (n22/l2 + m2)1/2 and k
n = m2l/2n. for
both functions, if and f f , the periodicity in x1 and
x, respectively, with periodicity length 2l, is obvious.
note that if contains a zero mode (n = 0), while f f

w = m2lx+/2 = 10000, n = 70.

by comparing the two gures one observes a striking dif-
ference. if is a smooth and regular function, while
f f looks noisy and irregular. furthermore, for xed
0 < x0 < l, if has compact support inside the lc,
x0 < x1 < x0 (and in the periodic copies of this inter-
val). outside the lc if shows tiny oscillations around
the value zero, which vanish in the limit n  . the os-
cillations are due to gibbs phenomenon (the fourier se-

2

ries does not converge uniformly in the vicinity of points
where the limiting function makes jumps). physically,
what happens is that we have point sources located at
positions x1 = 2ln. these emit spherical waves which
do not interfere unless x0  l. for x0 > l (not shown
here) we have an interference phenomenon so that if
no longer vanishes outside the lc, which is a straightfor-
ward consequence of periodicity.

the situation concerning f f is dierent. numeri-
cally, one sees that despite the irregular shape the sum
(9) converges to a periodic function. the most impor-
tant observation, however, is that f f does not vanish
outside the lc, i.e. for x < 0, x+ > 0 as in fig. 2. this
a clear violation of microcausality. we have numerical
evidence for a corresponding behavior in d = 3, 4 space-
time dimensions.

c. analytical results
let us try to get an analytical understanding of the nu-
merical results beginning with if . a straightforward
application of the poisson resummation formula yields

if (x) = xn

(x0, x1 + 2ln) ,

(10)

with the continuum  from (4). this result is exactly
what we see in fig. 1, a periodic array of (nearly) smooth
functions with support inside the lc (and its periodic
copies). it should be stressed that if is causal even for
nite extension l, i.e. without the innite-volume limit
being performed.

let us now analyze f f . first note the rather weak
localization properties of  in the lc direction x. for
positive lc time x+,  vanishes outside the lc, i.e. for
x < 0, and decays slowly for x > 0, asymptotically
like (x)1/4. the integrand in (6), denoted by i(k+),
oscillates rapidly for small k+ such that the zero mode,
i.e. the limit i(k+ = 0), is not dened.
it turns out
that this makes the application of poisson resummation
impossible. because the latter cannot be used, let us con-
sider the following alternative which leads to an analytic
and close approximation of f f . for this purpose we
rewrite (9) in terms of dimensionless variables (cf. fig. 2),

f f (v, w) =

n

xn=1

1

2n

sin(w/2n + 2nv) ,

(11)

with v  x/2l, w  m2l2(x+/2l). if we expand (11)
in powers of w, the sum over n can actually be performed
using summation formulae 1.443.1/2 from [16]. with the
restriction 1  v  1, the result is

f f (v, w) =

xn=0

wn

n!(n + 1)!

sgn(n+1)(v)bn+1(|v|) ,

(12)

where bn denotes the nth bernoulli polynomial [16]. the
series (12), being a power series instead of a fourier se-
ries, converges rather rapidly as a function of w. in ad-
dition, the limit is approached uniformly (no gibbs phe-
nomenon). this is obvious from fig. 3 where we compare
the resummed expression (12) with the fourier represen-
tation (11) (for w = 5). the agreement is quite impres-
sive which is to be expected as we have summed the rst
20 terms in (12).

(for n = 40) with the result of bernoulli resummation
(12), for w = 5, 1  v  1, n = 20.

numerically, one nds convergence if the number n
of terms summed over is of the order of w/2. this is
due to the fact that the amplitude of the bernoulli poly-
nomials bn decreases rapidly with n. thus, for w<
2,
4/m2l, the rst two terms in the expansion (12)
i.e. x+<
are already a rather good approximation so that we can
write,

(v2  |v| + 1/6) . (13)
f f (v, w)  
this result provides an analytical check that f f does
not vanish outside the lc (1 < v < 0), and thus, that
causality is violated.

restoration of a causal propagator

with representation (9) we are sampling a continuous
function i(k+) by equidistant points on a momentum grid
in k+. for small k+, however, this is a very bad approx-
imation, as i(k+) is rapidly oscillating there, with a fre-
quency increasing roughly as 1/k+. the point k+ = 0
is thus an accumulation point of the fourier spectrum.
in its vicinity, we should actually sample with a momen-
tum resolution k+
n  1/n. in other words, instead of
harmonic one should use anharmonic fourier analy-
sis. if we use (7) to introduce new discrete longitudinal
momenta,

n  n  k1
k

n =

1
l

(pn22 + m2l2  n) ,

(14)

we can write down the causal, nite-volume commutator
in terms of light-cone variables,

k+

(k+

l xn
n x+/2 + k+

c(x) = 

n )2 + m2

sin(kn  x) ,

(15)

where kn  x = k
n x/2. obviously, the mo-
mentum grid (14) used in (15) is not equidistant.
in
particular, for small k+
n , corresponding to large negative
k1
n  1/n. thus, the small-k+ region
n, one nds k+
becomes sampled in a reasonable way such that the fea-
tures of i(k+), which guarantee the causality of  are
properly described even on a nite (momentum) lattice
(see fig. 4).

conjugation symmetry is violated by imposing light-like
periodicity. furthermore, with microcausality being at
the heart of any dispersion relation, one expects prob-
lems also there. we have seen that one can taylor an ad
hoc momentum grid with a special anharmonic resolution
which remedies the causality violation of the commuta-
tor. it is an open question, however, whether this solves
the causality problem of dlcq in general. we expect
the answer to be negative: any causal green function
will have its own peculiar small-k+-behaviour and thus
will require its own momentum grid which generically
will be dierent from the one introduced above. an en-
suing dependence of results on a particular discretisation
choice clearly cannot be accepted.

the above analysis shows that one cannot have both,
periodicity in x and causality of the commutator
(x+, x).
if one insists on periodicity, one violates
causality and vice versa. consequently, the method of
dlcq in which the eld operators are expanded in peri-
odic plane waves, is non-causal. this does not come
as too big a surprise:
it is well known that dlcq
yields a rather poor representation of the small-k+
behaviour of observables [17]. using the relation be-
tween pauli-jordan function and feynman propagator,
(k) = sgn(k+)imf (k), we see that a causality vi-
olation also aects the feynman propagator f . note
that the causality of  can be viewed as a delicate
cancellation between particle and anti-particle propaga-
tion amplitudes. therefore it seems that also charge
